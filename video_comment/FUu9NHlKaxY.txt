Hopefully some of this on Sunday, both teams going at it HH
The VAR team and ref wouldn’t give Rangers a 100% penalty for the foul on Cerny because Rangers would probably have won.
One of the best Glasgow Derbies I've ever seen
Ugb vs ub
I notice almost ZERO scottish names on the players jerseys ? Is football being taken over too in scotland now ..smh where are all the scottish players
Still top of the table and will be playing in the Scottish cup final
Big respect for Celtic, from a S.E Palmeiras fan.
Celtic ❤ 🇹🇷
forgot the part when a rangers player was fouled in the box and no penalty was given. The SFA aplologies afterwards but no rematch
Daizen wife was living that for him. Well done Celtic here for another treble soon
Watp the times a changing 😌🟥⬜️🟦
Drug test immediately 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Bravo Bajrami!!!!! 1:11
The most biased you'll highlights you'll ever see. For everyone tuning in, Rangers had a stonewall penalty refused Rangers players threatened to be sent off for complaining, Celtic 3rd goal on review shouldn't have also stood because of Kuhnt clipping Diomande and then scoring never looked at until after the game with the review team.
There goes 5 seconds ads
love the maeda fam.
Great game; watched from Amsterdam 🧡
Says the bigot with a union jack behind him 😂stain
Daizen with the most casual penalty 🍀😂
Commentator proper Rangurs fan
This kasper schimechel could sometimes do like his father.
Celtic better hahahahhahahahhahahhahahah😊
Daizen maeda is such an amazing footballer the fans love him and don’t want to lose him so come on Celtic board please please offer daizen a new contract until 2030 we need him and don’t want another team to make him an offer 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🍀 🇮🇪 ☘️ 🇯🇵 💚 ❤️ 🤍
Celtic!
Daizen is our best player by a mile! Come on leaps and bounds in the last couple of seasons. ❤
4RBT is becoming more legit with these new promos. it's totally a game changer for the platform.
Celtic 900 titles and rangers 900 titles
Lisboa
was thar iain wright with maedas family?🎉
Daizen family  쵝오~~~`
As a rangers fan gutted on final result…. But to both teams wow what a bloody final! One of the best finals in a long time!…. Also between Kuhn and danilos goal like roughly 1 min 20secs!
great game but i felt like schmeichel was the hero not maeda, he should be recognized for his penalty save
Who on earth would call Celtic or the Scottish league good. I’m a very logical and reasonable person but this league of for tries to act like superstars and fans of a very mediocre club to act big time. I looooove football. I know football. But the fake hype around the Scottish prem is real and mad. Overpaying for average players… silly. Our cast off became your superstars… it’s not a stretch to say some English Sunday sides would give Celtic a game
Revenge feels good.
Here after Rangers got a well deserved revenge today.Thank you. 3-0.
Win 6 like what ?
H h
Respect Celtic from Red Star Belgrade fan.❤
Why don't they play until someone wins? This is like if a basketball game was tied and they decided the result by a game of "HORSE".
celtic got outrageously lucky.....Take away a deflected goal, Rangers gifting Maeda a goal and give Rangers the penalty they should have had then what's the score......Rangers comfortable win inside the 90.
Really cool celebration by bajrami 🌚
This is football
Japan 💌🥰☘️
Old firm delivering like it always does.  Congrats to Celtic from a Juventus supporter.
70k ppl watched it x10 !
I'm in the us and I'm dying to see one of these football games
Rangers V Celtic and ref and VAR end of
Fantastic Maeda und Nicolas kuhn
This is peak football lads, engagement, goals, excitement. What a game, i've missed this type of matchs. The japanese players on Celtic side are really hard working shout out for them
Big fish in a small pond
I don't think anywhere could match that atmosphere.
schemeciel the goat
7:59 Daizen!!!!
7:03 😂😂😂😂 7:08   7:20 Such provocations won't work for our Leo Hatate! You understand! Fucking fans of this Glasgow fake club! 😛😛😜😜🤪🤪😝😝
Celtic most successful cos you only play against part time butchers bakers postman and warehousemen. Scottish premier league equalivent to english local park football. And celtic best of the rubbish
isee this old firm derby as eng. vs scot but with awful quality football , Exciting but cant believe how poor the football is
Deadly Daizen maeda!!!! yokohama fc!!! j league legend!! i`m crying like his wife as a  j league fan!!😭
Каспер лучший!! Селтик с победой!
I’m no football expert.  However. championship games and cup finals should not end in a tie score.  There should be a clear winner.  Enough said.
Saya pernah mendengar sejarahnya,bukan hanya sekedar sepakbola tapi ada hubungan nya ke politik dan agama Protestan vs Katolik❤❤
Daizen never used to celebrate much when he or others scored now it looks like he loves it the most
Ulan rıdvan karşında emektar var başka o penaltı gol
5 days later and the meltdown continues 😂😂😂get it round the kot of yeees HH 119🏆🏆🏆
pertandingan yang seru
A crazy game 😳
Sfa corrupt to the core.
Rubbish league
Only Scottish watch this derby. Manchester derby even though it was a league game was watched by fans all around the world.
Budget trophy, budget teams.
World shocker, William(BILL BOYNE McCOLLUM,true blue No,1 sides wiv the HUN, quel surprise?  Wot will  Beaton do at GRAYSKULL wiv 5he w9rld WATCHING
Piling on the agony
Celtic as more as strong than Rangers
Lastima  q Palma ni lo metieron  pero nadie le quita  ser Campion
🍀
The fact rangers are still moaning about that pen even tho no one mention ccv being held back for their second
great final - ruined by MIA Vatican Assisted Ref's....
Hatate showed the way....
Congratulations Celtic from an virage sud membre. 💚
Celtic ❤👍
Have to laugh at all the bitter rangers fans as they have selective memory syndrome!! Silva diving for a pen in the moral victory game and Goldson blatant handball v Celtic which wasn't given?? Hypocrites every one of them
Blackburn Fan here.  Celtic Team/Fans best in world  Respect to you.
Congratulations Celtic from  Italian fans
Atmosfera fantastica, come solo certe partite in determinati Stadi,ti possono far vivere..... saluti da Luca da Genova Italy
The second Rangers goal was scored from a corner taken from the wrong side of the pitch.
3:38 CCV clearly being held back. The cheat in blue is literally holding his hand as the ball crosses the line.
Celtic in scotland is a King, but in europe they are Clown 😂
Now that is a cup final! On the sidenote, Leicester City is not the same after Kasper Schmeichel left.
Never showed the two penalties Rangerss were cheated out of by VAR. Another tainted  Celtic Cup.
Rangers can never catch a break from Celtic, always losing to them
Superb from Maeda - worked hard the entire game and his goal was top-class. The guy is a phenomenon. Taylor and Engels with some Mick Philpott style football however unlike Mick, they did manage to redeem themselves with the goal and the assist. The assist from Engels really showed us the player he is - a great run and a brilliant cut-back - but his defensive skills need a bit of work but at least he's progressing.
Well done Celtic winning a calender year treble winning two old firm cup finals ! Does it get any better than that!
Some of you guys need to look up the demolition derby when Henrick chipped the keeper. Rangers had international players all over the pitch and Celtic destroyed them.
Daylight robbery yet again .
If we turn up in new years game at ibrox we will spank them - we have been a bit off the boil in recent weeks due to schedule - but they got a week till next sun game and three full rest days before ibrox so less games is better
My favourite derby of all time after El classico all they watching from Tanzania🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿
congrats!
As a floating jobby that was shiite
Niente di nuovo…
🍀🇵🇸🍀🇵🇸🍀🇵🇸❤️🇪🇬
Maeda about to run to the line of Celtic players then changing his mind and running  to Schmeichel instead will always warm my heart
Celtic 3rd goal shouldn't have stood as kuhn fouled diamonde
On "penalties" not fucking pens.
مبروووووووووك سيلتك Celtic 🎉❤ From Yemen
Celtic 🟢🇵🇸
We were losing that game till Scsles replaced Trusty.. he made the difference..

I guess the caravan dwellers will be happy.
Go to 3 mins 35 gers second goal ccv getting held back foul no goal
Well done to both teams. A great game and a credit to Scottish football ⚽️ 👏
why both these teams are weak in the champions league  ???????
Celtic, Celtic.
Celtic is the biggest in Scotland. Congratulations from Spain!!
2 European power houses going at it.   :)
Why were the Celtic defenders doing a Nazi salute for the 1st goal?
Meltdown has been absolutely glorious man. I mean they're always funny but this has been another level, the worst losers you could ever imagine. 😂😂😂 Boycotts, protests, plans for tenny baws getting launched on the pitch, demands to jam our phonelines etc, just some of the stuff Sevco fans have been greeting about in the last few days. Get it right fucking up ye ya shower of greeting faced gimps. 🎉🎉🎉😂😂
Stupid rangers défense 2 goals gift from the défenders
What passion from Hatate after he scored his penalty
_CELTIC & PALMEIRAS_ 🇧🇷💚💚
Paulo ain’t the only Barnardo this club needs
The best Glasgow Celtic 👍👍👍
Why are there so many irish flags in the stadium if both sides are from scotland??
Congrats Celtic!  And Congrats Scottish League; that was an incredible final!
GLASGOW LEAGUE,how can they watch a league only won by 2 clubs for decades
That 2-1 score by Maeda is what you get for not signing Jose Cordoba when you could. Im sorry Rangers, things would have been different if not for that shambolic defending.  You fought hard on this one and came back but it's the details that killed you this time
There is nothing more satisfying than watch Rangers losing 🐖 Great job Celtic!
Son italiano juventino ma ho e amo il Celtic !!!grandi
Айброкс жеңеді✊
Terbaik Celtic 🇵🇸
Japanese ballers always class
Lennon said he was in one penalty shootout in his career v Partick thistle but I’m sure I was at a game Celtic v Valencia that we lost and he played that night, that went to pens too
8:02 Celtic in absolute heaven!!
Daizen Maeda my day. lol'
Amazing match!, 👌
119 huns
What a game
Poor goalkeeping of rangers
United fan here… Always liked Celtic and glad they got the job done. What a game man
Не понимаю,что мешает этим же командам играть также в еврокубках,ну красивая,живая игра же
Congrats Greens A Panathinaikos fan☘️
Nothing makes me happier than imagining how all the Unionists in Belfast are feeling right now
Battered at penalties then battered in the city 🤣🤣 all wearing masks getting done in 🍀💚 shitebags
I just woke up tired and this shit thrilling 😂
Where's the pen incident fs
Haven't seen a game this great for a long time. Well done Celtic and Rangers.
I honestly thought Celtic where very sluggish in performance but to come away with the win is a true mark of champions.ebem when we don't play well we still get the results,is that is the best team in the world now lol up the Celts Hail Hail 🇮🇪
Deadly Daizen maeda
Tavenier’s penalty run ups are embarrassing man.
The worrying thing now, is this new Sevco team are really starting to challenge for honours
Maeda what a goal and Schemeichel wow
Bye bye Rangers 😂😂😂😂
Bye bye😂😂😂😂
Glasgow is GREEN. Again. 💚
As a neutral who enjoys good football the defenses of each team was terrible, especially rangers....each goal could and should have been prevented
bUt iT wAs a pEnAlTy  Cry more, Huns 😂🖕🏻
That has brought out some sort of Santa hat riot in Glasgow
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Beautiful match to watch.
the commentator should be awarded .... a dummy sucker.....
Why have they cut out Rangers massive 4 on 1 chance on 51 mins? Also the 2 penalty claims mysteriously not there 🤔
What a final  Losing on pens is an absolute heartbreaker
Clyde phone in tonight Sevconian wanted replay as result ruined his family party.😂😂😂😂😂
Engels was far too weak in his tackle against the Rangers man for second goal. I think Casper should have ploughed through everyone to reach that crowd for the Rangers third goal. And Taylor nearly caused us to lose four goals due to his pathetic passing. Other than that !  We were OK.
The only Scottish football worth watching Celtic V Rangers absolute class
That was a bloody enjoyable match I must say!
Green nose day ❤❤
we love you, Celtic we do love Celtic we love you
前田ベタ褒めで嬉しい I'm glad that Maeda is so complimentary.
Fair play to Celtic. Was  an okay game lots of mistakes from both teams. Rangers are playing better than they were 4-5 weeks ago but that is not hard because we were utter crap and now we are headed in the right direction, playing better football. To any Celtic fan thinking it was only close because Celtic played badly 😂 that is a load of pish and you all know it. You got a gift for the Maeda goal and there was no pen when there should have been one, neither team played great. To any   folk come here to bash the Scottish game away, the fact is Scottish teams can compete with top tier talent in Europe and they have done for a long time with a lot less money than equivalent teams from England/Germany/Italy/France
You know the Scottish league is shite when they have a cup final before January 😂
from an outside perspective scottish football is a complete farce. just one team wins absolutely everything every year. utterly ridiculous
Celtic: disgusting team,repellent supporters.
Celtic won the Scottish cup in that game.hh🇮🇪🇮🇪🇵🇸🇵🇸💚
Congratulations Celtic from a Sevilla fan!! I still remember your pilgrimage to our city in 2003 for the Champions League final. You finished with the beer supplies of Seville hahaha.
best derby of all time as a neutral. this gives absolute goosebumps
Volim Seltik to je najveci klub na svijetu❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💪💪💪💪💪
Glasgow Celtic - Premier Sports Cup *CHAMPIONS. 😁💚👍🍀 * copyright Scottish media lol.
What a match it was. Mixed feelings about it 1. Its a loss so its pretty shit 2 im glad the players fought until the end and showed signs of improvement the past couple weeks. Now its time to battle on and see where we go from here.
Bet there was a lot of soggy butchers aprons after that...
Palestine
Both 💩 teams. Worse than english championship teams 😂
That was criminal laying in the box when Celtic scored 😂
Question. who was the commentator that sounded like Sid from Ice Age? i would have thought id grow used to him throughout but it drove me nuts at the same rate for the whole game
Brother beaton is never gonna give a penalty against celtic, need i say anymore? Scales foul against cerny ON THE 18 YARD LINE thats a pen, rangers robbed again. 🙄 🇬🇧
How tf they won a trophy and we're not even at the half of the season what is this league
Rangers fan here,Maedas goal was outstanding
The best League Cup Final i have ever seen: so intense and emotional. GO CELTIC!!!
Shit cup it's about the only thing they can win
Ulan Rıdvan kalecinin penaltıya bak birde senin vuruşa
Hi! We are a new football channel, subscribe please❤
Go Celtic bravo 👏 🙌 💪
Maeda scores .camera turns to his family.  Brilliant. 🍀🍀🍀
probably the first time in decades that rangers fans have stayed until the final whistle of a game 🤣
7 fans to watch them pick up runner up medals 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🍀don’t do walking away.  Just bolt
Irish beat the English in glasgow again
The sounds of the Celtic fans every Time they scored come on haha love to see it
WHAT. A. GAME.
Rangers fan, well done Celtic on your victory, Maeda goal was a fantastic finish. Great cup final right to the very end. You can say what you want but each side needs each other to bring out the best of Scottish football.
A proper cup final that was. HH
Celtic is superior in every aspect. They should have won but at least a 3 goal-difference
kasper schmeichel encroaching for 2 penalties
Well done Bhoys, real 55 INCOMING.
🇨🇻🇨🇻
セルティックおめでとおおおおおおおお‼‼‼‼
Scumbags.
One question . Who cares About scotland ?
with a voice like Alan Huttons .. commentary & tv should never have been part of his future plans
Looks like Ian Wright? at 8:06
I must admit Rangers did very well to score a goal today, they are usually not that good
The worst league on the planet, but Celtic vs Rangers is always a must-watch.
Bernardos baw through to Kuhn was a thing of beauty, if only Kuhn could have tucked that away
Yet again Beaton and the corrupt w@nkers in VAR are the difference in a cup final. There are no depths these cheating vermin won't stoop to assist the beggars!
Thank god the racists lost.
Gifted the game and robbed again
Looked like a good game to be fair.
Absolute belter, no personal interest in this game but you just won't find an atmosphere like thet anywhere else
Aberdeen are better than Rangers
It's good to watch it back now but it was over 2 hours of pain watching it live. We played our football for 10 minutes and had 4 shots on target and 2 goals, this after almost conceding a 2nd on a bizarre 4 on 1 situation that seemed to rattle Rangers more than it did us. That's the 2nd 3 each game in a year, at least the neutrals cant accuse it of being boring!
WHY CARNT THEY HAVE HOME AND AWAY FANS IN THE LEAGUE FIXTURES? MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE
BYE BYE Rangers!
United 🤝 Celtic
Glasgow again is Green 🟢 & White ⚪️ hail hail.    🟢⚪️🟢⚪️🟢⚪️
Well done lads ...
Celtic takes the lead with one extra trophy, making the total trophy haul 119. Rangers led the way for 86 and a half years (approx). Great final 🔥 love the rivalry 💪🏼
Well done Celtic. And a great final.
Rangers fan and its one of the best finals I've watched i don't have blue tinted glasses either fair play to Celtic it could have went anyway but i think Celtic just always get the job done regardless and i pains me to say it. on a side note rangers need to pay like this every game not just cup finals
Rangers really pushed hard - fair play - we need each other
Hope those hun tears are salty
Win rangers
Kuhn tripped Diomande for Celtics third. Why wasnt that taken back to the foul? Why didnt VAR intervene at the penalty incident with Cerny. Two tier officiating as usual.
Was that Ian Wright amonthe fans celebrating at the end ?
Yet another dodgy refereeing decision decides the destination of a cup. Scottish referees need to taught the rules.
Kasper Schmeichel what a signing
WHY THE FUCK did you have to put the result of the game on the video's title? Why do you pricks do that?
Magnificent final and occasion.  Well played to both teams and both sets of fans. Meanwhile in England, I watched one of the worst Manchester derbies of all time in the boring, overhyped premier league.  No tempo, no aggression, no atmosphere, etc.  Should have also been an ‘’occasion’ but the life has been sucked out of top level football by money, corporate greed and maybe even corruption.  Give me passion and drama every time over what most PL games produce.
i hope i will visit this Derby. im looking forward. one day i will be here !  great fans great atmosphere !!! i love it !💪💪💪💪
古橋亨梧はどうなった？😂
More cheating from the refs involved , games a bogey in Scotland
Just need to take the positives from the game, and the fact Cerny should have had a penalty from the Ralston incident. And there GK was standing inside the box for two penalties.
Fuck Celtic.
Was there no extra time?
Not a mention of the game on the BBC breakfast sport section.
SHOCK HORROR GASP.      CELTIC WIN ANOTHER SCOTTISH TROPHY WASN'T EXPECTING THAT JUST SEEN THE LEAGUE THEY ARE 9 POINTS CLEAR HAVEN'T LOST A GAME 44 GOALS TIME TO CHANGE SCOTTISH FOOTBALL STRUCTURE IT'S A BLOODY NONSENSE A FARCE HOW ON EARTH CAN YOU TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY.        THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO COMPETITION END OF PERIOD IF I WAS A SUPPORTER UP THERE I'D BE EXTREMELY EMBARRASSED BY THE WHOLE SYSTEM MAYBE CELTIC SHOULD COME DOWN HERE AND PLAY HEY IF SHAMCHESTER CITY GET BOOTED OUT CELTIC CAN TAKE THEIR PLACE    PROBLEM SOLVED.     SORRY FOR CAPS LOST CONTACT LENSE SO USING 🔎🔍 ♥️🏐🥅⚽💙
Celtic wer.shite lol

Nedim Bajrami! Albanian idol!!!
Каспер
Nice celebration Bajrami ya fairy 💩
Well done Rangers. You made it a fight. Celtic warriors, we never doubted you.
3-3 after full time then extra time yeah soooooooo far apart
The Old Firm Derby living up to its reputation! What a match!!! Up the Bhoys!!!!
Alan Hutton!!! Dearie me!!! That guy wouldn’t shut the fck up! The poorest co commentator in the history of any broadcasting company. A very tired listen and MUST cost Premier Sports a fortune with people cancelling there subscriptions
Im a Rangers fan im sickened by yet another defeat at hampden who cares if we played well we lost thats all i care about no one remembers if you played well its the result that matters and all these oh well we did great clap them off idiots can go home its the taking part that counts clowns are serial lovers of losers they dont hurt like we do as for dessers get him out jan 1st on the transfer list asap as he bottled taking a pen and chucked  yilmaz and butland under the bus the guy is a disgrace to the shirt no wonder the club cant win things with gutless losers like him
Celtic fan here, impressed by Rangers attitude in continually coming back especially after the third. Their heads didnt go down and responded immediately. Gojng into pens is a lottery and cruel way to lose. Very good game but super stressful for all involved
CELTIC DEFINITELY HAVE THE INDIAN SIGN ON RANGERS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ESPECIALLY IN CUP FINALS, GREAT GAME NO ONE DESERVED TO LOSE,
veri good footbal wowwwwwwwww rangers and celtic
ngl that was dios fault sitting on his ass in the 86th min is criminal while khun runs in free
That's why football is no1 sport 🍀
Was that Ian Wright I seen there at the end aye?
Rangers must be a an all time low
Look at the schmeichel standing inside the box coz Beaton was his best pal yesterday pure robbery for rangers sfa is a joke worst refereeing I’ve saw get him sacked
Next up take away the 55 Hail Hail
What a match this was.😭🔥
Treble on the way 🍀
Celtic have the better team but Rangers have the better fans. Great game
Rangers were done out of a stonewall penalty, no surprise there. Celtic always seem to win a cup on a dodgy decision, 12th man and VAR are always on Celtic's side
I suggest making votes for those two clubs to be shifted for a premier league!!!
Two pub league sides fighting it out for a tinpot trophy 😂 pathetic Jock trash 😂
Amd this is why most football fans have the Old Firm on their bucket list.
HAIL HAIL THE CELTS ARE HERE ☘️☘️☘️
Great game for both sets of fans and the neutrals . Have to give it to the honest decent rangers fan who applaud celtic and must also give it to rangers player's getting back a goal after 21 seconds , I i follow three teams Newcastle, celric and napoli and even after games I  feel either gutted or pleased but chat with opposing fans and youll still get a good chat and banter going , its a game at the end if the day , let the battle on the field and enjoy the banter jokes and chat afterwards, great day for Scottish football ,well done to both teams , no matter what you think or say , celtic need rangers and rangers need celtic for us all to enjoy the derby days ,Ii would love to see other teams  challenge them as well , Aberdeen, hibs and hearts etc all out challenging them not just in the domestic league but in europe as well
Daizen the hunskelper ,what a goal 😆😆🏆🇮🇪🇮🇪
Love it 😀 bye bye rangers bye bye 🎉🎉🎉🎉😂
Never a dull moment in the game. It's good to see Rangers making this a worthy match
Celtic having a nightmare of a day and win. Sevco making their best match for years and lose. Let that sink in. I think that says it all. The odd semi or final to is the nearest they will get to Celtic for some years. They might eventually sneak a cup or so but thats it. 🍀🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🍀🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🍀
The difference from the first half to second half is because of scales what a difference!
Congratulations Celtic from an Athletic Club Bilbao member.
Good game. Either team would be a credit to the  English Championship, or League One.
Celtic Champion 💚🤍
This Sunday morning footie is brilliant entertainment, it makes our non league in England look abysmal 😂😂😂😂
Oooh look, the usual two teams in the Scottish farmers league in a final again ! 🥱
you re coming to Amads den soon boys....
The way Clement in the last week has regularly spoken about not having the same finances as Celtic (Tottenham ) ….yet he never mentions the disparity of other spfl clubs when he is playing them.  What a joke of a man!
Fino al confine poi basta 🖐️
Celtic are an annoyingly horrible club and I'm not even a fan of both Glasgow teams
This is a real aerobatics of Scottish football clubs - it was a real battle between two irreconcilable and two of the strongest clubs in the history of Scotland.😎🤗🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Yet another ood firm defeat for Clemente,how much longer will they put up with this do you think? cos he aint gonna walk from his contract and they cant afford to sa k him😅
..and they DID surrender..as usual
The difference having both sets of fans makes to the Old Firm Derby.
Well, I'm a life-long Celtic fan who is getting on in years. I'll just say this, I haven't seen such an incredible Celtic v Rangers derby ever. And to win the cup was a blessing. Well done lads, you did your supporters proud!😁😁😁!!!
😂😂😂 hahaha HAHA
A proper derby. The derby. Best game in the world. Great show for Scottish football.   🍀🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
The excellent job of the Old Firm!
Why would you comment pretending to be a smelly hun just to say Rangers fan here gg.. get a fukn life man.
Buzzing lads 🍀🏆
Once again Greg Taylor get him to fuk man… anyway Haha John Beaton 😂😂😂😂
Not Celtics best performance today but yet again Rangers tried their hardest and it just shows time and time again they don’t have the minerals to see it over the line.
❤❤❤
As a neutral fan, Daizen Maeda looks better with hair
Brilliant!
Fans got their monies worth in this game, wow, just wow.
Their precious record is gone, Celtic THE most successful club in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🍀
Comical football,
流石は日本の誇る韋駄天前田大然！ 天晴れ！🇯🇵🎊🗻🎆
What a game in that 2nd half really think we got lucky today though that chance with igamane he plays the ball to left two rangers player where away but he gave it to the player on the right should have been 2 nil at that point game would have been over but even on a worst days we still own them😂
Rangers made far to many bad passes and mistakes gave away the ball to easily.
No extra time only 90 minutes 😮
COME ON CELTIC !!!  greatings frome Rome yellow-red part  Glasgow is only white & green  🤍💚👏🤙👍💪⚽️🏆🥇🔝
Maeda has cemented himself in Celtic folklore. Also, Taylor was rank today.
Any Scottish players actually playing😂😂
Speaking as a neutral, this has to be one of the greatest Scottish cup finals of all time....  Yerrrr beautyyyyyyyy!!!! 🇮🇪☘️🇵🇸☘️🇮🇪...oops have I just let my allegiance slip?😅
Most successful team in Scotland now Celtic 😢
Old firm derby's never fail to disappoint the rivalry, the battle and competitive nature these matches always great to watch
fantastic performance from both teams..  great game!
The penalty shoot out is a bummer especially when it's been a great game
Celtic Fan but good to see more fight in this Rangers team, players lived up to the fixture, great to watch.
Peasant
Celtic poor today Still better thsn rangers
Defeat for the harry dunn eleven and they are raging again
Up the Celtic!!!
Notice that the one was it in the box or on the line wasn't shown 🤔
YNWA Celtic 🙏🏻🫶🏻🫡 from Liverpool
Celtic are always so lucky with having Japanese players in their squad….unlike when in Premier League,,
Fantastic game either team deserved it today.. but the best won 💚🫡
Pröpper final right there
Respect celtic ❤️💚
Apologies but I’m a naive Welshman. Can anybody explain why Rangers fans have union jacks (a flag that we Wales fans hate) and Celtic fans have Ireland flags? They are both Scottish clubs so where the f**k are the Scottish flags. It’s so weird!!!😊
Two teams shite scared of defending always makes for a class game of football
Rangers and Celtic have no real competion in the Scottish  Premier League and would both struggle in the English Champio ship let alone the English Premier League.Its been a meaningless 2 horse race for decades...whats the point of it?🤔
レオはお腹が痛かったのかな？　おめでとうセルティック！
すごすぎる試合
So does this make Celtic the most successful team in the world? Any Huns want to clear that up for me?😂
As a neutral don’t think you’ll ever come across a more likeable footballer than Daizen Maeda. 100% work rate and does anything asked. It was nice to see his family see him get the winner.
That was a great final. I don’t care about Celtic and Rangers.
🍀🇮🇪🍺
This is what the OLD FIRM SHOULD BE. from a rangers fan in Belfast. What a game of football!!!! Fair play to Celtic..... WATP ❤
my favorite team at all times I love you Celtic I will be with you at all times I dream of seeing a match of my team in the stadium love you celtic from algeria
Daizen Maeda you absolute LEGEND!
GO HOME YA HUNS
The standard of Scottish football is terrible. Very entertaining match though.
That was a seriously brilliant game!
It hurts….it really hurts! But we were beaten fair and square.
Who’s the guy with glasses beside maedas family after penalty?
Celtic win a cup that has no importance  for them domestically its a bonus trophy it should  have a conference league 2nd qualifying round spot to give the lower league sides motivation.  That way even if celtic or rangers win it then the spot goes to other best team in the competition
"Neutral" here (dislike both clubs): great match, great entertainment.
02:35. Worst passage of football I've seen for about a year 😂 shetland ponies league at its best.
Watching the highlights Celtic were the better side. Justice done in end.
Salute From Detroit! Much Luv Celtics 💯 Salute Parkhead Bhoy 🫡
Thanks for the spoilers in the title, assholes
Both Glasgow teams going hammer and tongue for 120+ minutes - A game for the neutral but not for either set of fans... but it had it all and goals galore just what a cup final needs!
Hell of game 50/50 pens biggest positive to come out that game is brother Beaton is now father Beaton so that puts that myth to bed thought we was going get whopped up you know your doing alright when Willie collum blacks out the var room sorry john we did not see it #addwartitles
Daizen maeda
Greetings from Italy! Celtic Fans are the best in Europe !! Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Rangers fans are the fastest to leave a stadium x
Farmers league. Premier league and La liga > If only rangers beat the team that makes scottish league boring celtic
Y s around to the bine
All of Celtics goals were class rangers had wee shity tap ins, great to see kuhn get his first goal against the huns, roll on the 2nd now 🍀🍀
4:17 so you're telling me, that a Professional Football Player like the Number 10 of the Rangers Squad, trips, and falls, and instead of getting up to cut the pass, he just stayed there sitting and then asked for a foul or whatever? What a fucking waste of salary.
cerny robbed a penalty for sure... the line still counts as a pen
Jeez how clingy are rangers 😂😂😂🍀🍀🍀
It’s bizarre for a non-Scot to read how fair and sportsmanlike a lot of these comments are in both directions lol.
🍀🎉🍀🎉🍀🎉
💪🇮🇪💚🇵🇸💪
Celtic made heavy weather of the final but eventually the sun shone
Irish blood  Can't be beaten
Paedos clinging on against an awful rangers side
who are these gimps in the comments acting mutual for some likes on their comment 😂 clowns
Ah be Rıdvan’ım …
So it’s been co firmed it should have been a penalty against Scales… can’t make it up  Celtic got the refs on side as usual 😂😂😂 would love to have a proper game of football without Celtic refs helping them out
such poor football.... all of the goals that rangers coneded were silly mistakes that could have been easily avoided. Very poor quality defensive.
Saying they aren’t far behind. A one off game in a final anything can happen 😂😂😂😂 miles off it in the league. Horrible club and fan base. Long live the banter years
Rubbish Rangers 🤣🤣
Up the Celts 🏆🍀
Another fantastic 3-3 victory for Filip Flop 👏
Hun tears drank tonight 🤪
Igamane what a player
Kasper doing alright in the goal I reckon....😉
Most successful club in Europe 🍀
Never in doubt tbh. Never for a minute doubted that Scotlands premier club would add yet another trophy! Sevco gave it a go but no different from an Aberdeen or hearts would. Champs won in 1st gear 🤷🏻‍♂️
It must be so hard in Scotland, pretty much every time you lose something, it is to your bitter rivals. I guess there is the flip side though, and it is the same for the wins.
2:37 Best goal of the match. Sheer brilliance by Maeda.
the ranjurs will be raging
Why rangers  manager  don't  let  bajrami playing  hi keep  replace  in bajrami  all time   .I think  the manager   ned too  get sack
Scottish football is as exciting as a coin toss.
Delicious loyalist tears
Never really got out of first gear, and feels like rangers gave it their all. Scraped it, but it's a win!
Tough watch, but one of the best ways to beat them. Idah, Engels, McGregor, Hatate, Maeda. Cold.
Know your place Rangers 😎🍀
Классная игра!!!
What was Butland doing for that final pen 😂
Celtic played their new European game, too much backwards and sideways, too slow.  They need to remember who they are playing and get the speed back.
Well done lads grinding out another one hail 🇳🇬 hail 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬💥😶‍🌫️
Scotland most successful football club. Rangers have nothing to gloat about now. Scotlands green and white
One of the best match in the world.
Congratulations Bhoys well played , hopefully the first of many to come , big shout to the new players who signed , this is the reason you came , also big shout to the players , couches , manager,  keep up the great work YNWA HH ❤❤
119😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪the first and real 55 is incoming 🤑😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿😃ps mind the gap 😂🤣😁🤑😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪
Who’s rangers number 10 lying on floor for Kuhns goal
Turkish Delight
So the highlights don’t show the penalty that VAR should have given for Rangers😂😂😂😂 what’s the point in having VAR fs  Kuhn fouls Diomamde in the build up to his goal as well  Celtic apparently so good they had to go to penalties 😂😂😂  Not to mention Rangers had a big game on Thursday night while Celtic played a club team on Tuesday 😂😂😂
The Rangers got 8 (EIGHT) Yellow cards. I don't know how they managed to avoid any reds.  At least second yellows not given. Aberdeen had the same result at Hampden against Celtic in April but didnt get away with kicking the opposition off the parkl
As a rangers fan it was disappointing to lose the match, but it was a great game to watch. Celtic weren’t at their best at times and managed to dig out that little bit extra to take the trophy, which is the mark of an excellent squad of players. Good to see rangers making progress, a month ago they were nowhere near being competitive. Hopefully they can build on recent form and at least try and give a good account of themselves. Celtic too far ahead in the league to be caught given their form and the depth of their squad.
Magic, well done Celtic x
Sevco played the best they have played in years and still couldn't beat a poor celtic performance 😂😂😂
Celtic on a bad day in a bad run of form still can’t be touched
Maeda, Legend...
Media talked up Rangers all week.  But Celtic do the business.
Celtic are a class football club.
Congratulations Celtic, overtaking Rangers to now become the most successful British team in history 🇬🇧.
The celik need to be winning in europe , but there happy beating st jhonstone ,falkirk n all scots teams n there  just beating rangers in most derbys , get to a QF,SF in europe get more respect then rangers just ran n put a lot in draw wae spurs , well done on the 1st cup of the season
What is even point of Scottish football? Rangers and Celtic might as well play couple of games for the league and the cups.
Top team in scotland battered by the team in 3rd place ✅
that wee Turd went out of his way to try & shoulder checked Arnie only to miss his penalty was great.
Billie MC Neal is proud in heaven...🍀🍀
🇮🇪🏆🇬🇷☘️💚💚💚 ΑΔΕΡΦΙΑ!!!!!
Big jock knewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
The atmosphere at these derbies is probably the most hostile in the world. Two giant clubs
A lovely final. Well done celtic and good to see rangers playing well. Plenty of level headed old firm supporters to balance out the absolute thickos who cant be magnanimous in vistory or defeat. Grow up!
Hagi is an asshole. Back in your face, punk.
Scottish football is very rarely this entertaining (Celtic, or Rangers always win the league, a boring league) but occasionally it produces something special...
Im a irish catholic an i even think its a load f shit😂😂😂😂
Hold that yae thatcher worshipping pricks
Rangers still celebrating the draw with spurs and a moral victory today
That was to close for comfort. Rangers pushed us all the way. Great game for a neutral but omg as a Celtic fan it was nerve racking.
8:05　Daizen family🎉🎉
all the Tims on here thinking they just battered Rangers off the park, took them to Pens to win! Stop making yourself look like an arse an just admit both teams were good and it had to be decided on Pens. Was a great game to watch
Winners 🍀
Two little clubs having a kick about 😂😂😂😂
As a Celt Rangers have improved immensely and it just adds to quality should have beaten Spurs in the week
A credit to Scottish football!!
I never watched the match  Did they also play 15 mins each half of extra time for 120 minutes total or did they just go straight from 90 to pens?  If they draw after 90 mins in Scottish Cup Final assuming they meet each other will they scrap the extra 30 mins and just go straight to Pens?
Why is there just so much hate
Was extra time rubbish?
Up the cats🇮🇪💚🤍
Celtic fc- 119 Sevco- 3
What a game of football 🍀😂🍀😂
Same auld.....yawn
Ah yes….the two horse race in the world’s dullest league strikes again.
Why do the rangers fans barely celebrate their goals? Most of them appeared to be standing still even after the last minute equaliser?
Congratulations bhoys
When cheating chidren out their innocence just isn’t enough.
Great game celtic fans enjoy more  great days to come ❤
If you watched the game you can see Celtic have far more quality
Champions again!
We all love it 😂👊🏼🇮🇪🏆🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿👊🏼
Fair play to rangers, everyone was writing them off due to their poor start to the season but they matched us for the whole game. What a game of football. We can be proud of our game up here
😁🍀
Salford vs Oldham is a bigger Derby
Celtic 🇮🇪 - 119 Huns 🇬🇧 - 115 Sevco 🇬🇧 - 3   😂😂😂😂  Piling on the agony
What a game!! An Excellent advert for Scottish football absolutely an amazing game had everything. I watched Tottenham play Rangers on Thursday and thought they should have beaten Tottenham so I knew Celtic would have it tough and it went all the way.👍 Also special mention to Diazen what a work horse that guy has  endless energy and a superb goal took down with the right and scored with his left to class.
With a bit of luck, every Celtic player stands on dug shite on the way home
I presume as a ignorant neutral that none of these teams are Scottish?All I witnessed was Irish flags and English or Union jacks.
Rangers fans were home before Celtic even lifted trophy
YASSSSS Celtic 💚🤍💚🤍
Lmao Scottish league is an absolute joke. I'd not be sitting there giving it the big welly in the comment section over winning cups in that league. I'd actually be embarrassed and delete my comments 🤣🤣🤣
Maeda such a nightmare for Rangers.
Pacific shelf....the cult that keeps on giving.....look at that picture of those 3 clowns.....laughing at their clubs child abuse victims!!!!
Celtic defensively awful at times and still scored 3. Imagine Rangers facing this team when they are on it from the first minute.  No contest.
Penalties are always a lottery .
Merry Christmas Pluck The Buns
Maedas goal was pure amazing. I had to change the stream I was watching as some English commentator said celtics goals were just lucky and rangets goals were great, where about? Taylor literally passed for the 1st. We should of won the game easy but we made hard work for ourselves. We need to get in a good free kick and corner taker as at the moment they are just wasted opportunities.
For Callum McGregor never to lose a cup final is just an amazing stat. We know we can play better but well done Celtic and unlucky to the decent rangers fans out there.
Proud of gers.all the celtic fans thought they were gonna crush us today.fact is celtic aint as good as they think.
Wonder if they will still play and sing the most successful team in football at ibrox 😂😂
Dirty hamas supporting club
Celtic FC - 119 Zombies FC - 115 Sevco FC - 3
Merry Christmas everyone ☘
I hope the guy that gets hired to take that out of date trophy wallpaper down at Ibrox gets paid 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Celtic celtic celtic
Yasss
Rangers made septic look as good as they are... with a few centre halfs rangers would have won that game. Big Phil had brendas number with the tactics. A few mistakes let us down. The better squad won the match but we're closer than they think. Having brought in no cunt. The tears if that penalty went the other way would have been funny... we'll see them soon enough
Not my 1st choice team but have always been a fan of celtic especially since the Nakamura era, i still remember his freekick against Man utd in the 06/07 CL match. And now its Hatate, Furuhashi and Maeda who shines for Celtic. I even bought maeda on EAFC for Ipswich and hes amazing on there (Ipswich isnt my teameither i just like doing careers that arent top oil money rich teams) Congrats Celtic and what a final it was
Be like Rangers, make a name in Europe, leave the Pub league behind!
Enjoying the ranting , raving , rabid , rangers fans Keep it coming 😂😂😂
Celtics third goal shouldn't have stood. Khun takes out the player tracking him. This is the reason he is sitting on the ground in the box as khun received  the pass to score.   When khun initially runs with the ball, and releases it out wide, after the pass, he stands on the boys heel, taking him out. Should have been pulled back.
Well done to Rangers. So proud of you actually competing. Superb.
Sorry to say that some of rangers players don't deserve to play for the team, second I think it is time to change the coach, he did his bit , he can't go far.
Hagi chatting shit with the keeper just to go on and lose 🤣
As a neutral.. everyone loves watching the huns greet especially on pens... KHARMA..
As Rangers fan even though we lost we did better than I thought unlucky Rangers
As a neutral that was a great game well done both teams and congratulations Celtic
ref was a joke tbh 😅
Yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss that good celtic 👏 😊
Silence of the Bams final lol 😂
Run ya rats
Once again the refs intervene to help their favourite club
Lovely stuff 🍀
Well done the unwashed. Enjoy the hangover tomorrow
Why is it Scottish league with Irish fans 🤔
Make no mistake, Rangers showed that we aren’t perfect. Some of the defending was shambolic! Rangers played really well, and it was an uncomfortable afternoon for us! We won the cup but if I was a Rangers supporter (god forbid) apart from us getting our hands on the silverware they should be happier with their teams overall performance than we should be! If we had played to our potential it wouldn’t have gone to extra time! Report card should read, “Must do better!” 🤔🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇵🇸🍾🥂
Gutted rangers did not win  better team than won rangers manager p45
The two clubs are a disgrace to scotland
Muir cheating Cnut simple as that
Celtic squeaked by to victory today🙌🙌🙌 , our back line look jaded, about half a second too slow on the ball allowing Rangers to get it every time, midfield not half as fluent as usual but even on a bad day we can dig out a win so big congratulations 🥳 It must be obvious to Rogers by now though who is a liability when they’re on the pitch, I would have left Bernardo stay on or put McCowan. ☘️❤️☘️
Up the Hoops., 🍀🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🍀💚☮️🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴
Celtic can't save you  Rangers cant save you Hating Celtic can't save you  Hating Rangers can't save you  Only JESUS CHRIST can save you  Surrender your life to The LORD JESUS CHRIST  John 3:16 The LORD JESUS CHRIST told us to love our enemies, so whsts the point in hating Celtic or Rangers Why wastw your life being filled with hate, bitterness, bigotry and sectarianism  Both clubs can do nothing for you
That game was nuts, fitting for a final.
💚💚💚
Merry Christmas everyone 😂😂😂😂😂
Seems the Celtic fans would rather be living in Ireland. Off ya go. You won’t be missed.
It’s a great day when Celtic win, it’s a great day when rangers loose. It’s an even greater day to see Celtic beat rangers, even tho it’s nth out of the ordinary
Wonder what team the officials support🙄
Poor game atween 2 poor teams!
SO satisfying to see 'The massive gap' reduced to there pre 2012 lucky bobble goals. Without Rnagers mistakes and your bench you'd get run over. Matter of time.
How terrible were Celtic fans? Didn't even hear them
Make Rangers greet 😭 again 🍀🏆
great final
Rangers/The Zombies should be relegated for being a parochial shoite proddie club    KTID
Farmers Cup final  Farmers 3 - Farmers 3  Farmers win on pens
Just keep winning bhoys 🎉😅
Greet, ya hun bastards 😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🍀🍀🍀
Oh so good! Well done the Bhoys, and lots of poo poo to the Huns!
What was the final score for celtic and rangers
From a Rangers man, fair play to Celtic. What a game of football 👏
Great match!
Celtic fan great match very little between both teams today.Brendan Rodgers is our walter and his record against Rangers speaks for itself,hes a serial winner in Scotland.
Clement spoke poorly, Tavernier spoke well - no excuses
hahahaahahhah fuck the huns
Congratulations Celtic Glasgow 👏 🙌 👍. Best club in Scotland . Godbless. Greetings from Leicester 🇬🇧. Congratulations Celtic FC. Artur Boruc 🇵🇱 ❤️ Holy Goalie hehehe. Godbless.
Juuuuhuuuuu!
A great 119 performance Hail hail
Celtic you need to tighten it up at the back .
Rangers were in trouble from the moment they could only draw at home v that useless Tottenham side!😵‍💫
That surely has to be one of the all time great League Cup finals.
Amazing Celtic do it again 💪🇮🇪👍📿
Go on Celtic 🇮🇪
1st I’m a Celtic fan,living down south.both parents born in Glasgow.GET THE BRITS OUT NOW, an celtic is an Irish club.is aload of pish.I understand we were inherited by Irish decent.an I think the whole world knows about out heritage. But let’s b real.without Celtic playing on British soil.we wouldn’t b recognised as big as we r.who the fuck watches Irish football.AS FOR RANGERS ,great game.but ur still shite.💚🍀
Up the road you dirty hun bastards
I don’t support neither of these clubs, but did anyone notice John Beaton obstructing Černý before Maeda scored 2:38
Shame it had to end in Penalties, a great game nevertheless well done Celtic.
☘️☘️
call it the scottish league cup - can you ever imagine the english fa cup becoming the gregg's sausage roll cup or something?? ffs...
Unlucky Rangers. Almost😂
When you Die where will you go?  pray, Jesus forgive me of my sin, save me ,be my Lord & my Saviour, you have come in the flesh, died & risen for me, Jesus is my Lord ! Amen. Read John 3.
Mickey Mouse league    Two loads of bigots
4:43 Rangers player just fancied a wee lie down 😂
thanks sevco for an early christmas gift very nice indeed
I am lost here surely Rangers won it with a 3 3 draw???  ..
Celtic fc the world's most successful team ever HH 🍀🍀🍀💪
Celtics third penalty should have been retaken smichael was in the area by two foot how it daint get noticed I don't know
lots of goals, but quality so mid
It's the season of luv and understanding, Merry Christmas ya durty hun .
Farmers league, the quality is shocking
How good is it that they are happy not getting pumped but actually making a game of it. We were well off it first half, they played their best and still couldn't win.  That was better than a 5-0 d Humping coz they thought they nearly won it. 😂😂😂😂
This is horrifically edited
Celtic were not great today.  Rangers are looking better and better.  Ultimately, Celtic won but Rangers can take a lot from the fight.  Good cup final.  Good to have both sets of fans there.
At this point any manager would go to Celtic at this rate just to have 1 free trophy on them
Skelped again. Beautiful. 🍀
Most successful team in Scotland 😎🏆🍀
Congrats japan
Celtic now have 119 major trophy wins.  World record 8 domestic trebles.  Only team to ever win a quadruple treble.  First british team and only Scottish team to be champions of Europe.   Both Rangers and The Rangers trophy haul combined is at 118. Rangers did however, win 13 trophies during the EBT years, so 105 trophies and 13 tainted, cheated trophies.
Never in doubt
Neither team would have deserved to lose. As a Celtic fan I am delighted.
🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪🇮🇱🇮🇪
Big Respect from Ireland 🇮🇪 👏  love it 💚
Clement moans about VAR again. 😂
My mother always said however bad things are there is always someone worse. So my Palestinian  friends you could be Rangers supporters.  🇵🇸🇮🇪☘️
Sevco living rent free in your tiny tiny little minds. Smell the many mob.
Can't beat the Celtic Glasgow .
Get it up ye Huns
Making Rangers greet again
120 trophies and counting. Welcome to the chase ☘️🇮🇪
Hagi looking idiot now 🤣🤣
If u don't spank them win it on pens it's so sweet. We're in our bad patch still winning still lifting trophies. 😂
Ridvan Ramsay 😂
Its not a classic both teams are shite and playing in one of the worse leagues in the world!😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Can't wait to hear Jim White tomorrow on Talksprt. He'll mention this game for all of 1 min
Did the game go straight to penalties after full-time ?
Congratulations Ireland 🇮🇪 with your victory over the Scot’s 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 today 🎉
Time to rewrite that song, rangers aren’t even the most successful team in Glasgow anymore
Some things never change. Great to see the ragers fans are so proud of the team sadly those fans at the game weren't. They couldn't leave quickly enough. Ahh ill never get tired of this Celtic winning again again and again.
For a club built on penalties, they're not very good at penalty shoot outs 😂😂 well in Celts 🥳🍀🍀
Even when we play terrible they still can’t beat us. It’s just beautiful. Scotlands most successful club. Round yees 😃🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪👌🏻👌🏻
Rangers absent for years and only today have the caught up despite winning trebles. Shows how far ahead Rangers were under better players and managers
That hampden pitch state of it for a national pitch. Disgrace
Celtic “ the most successful club in the world” x 💚🤍🧡
119 trophies ! How competitive !
I don't support either team but I find it very sad that the only winner today seems to be hatred! Can't both clubs put an end to this pathetic shit and just enjoy the football? At the end of the day it's only a game for goodness sake.
MERRY CHRISTMAS! F the huns🙂🍀
Even with Celtic being at 10% of their best, Rangers STILL cannot beat them.   Worlds most successful club my ass 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel so sorry for the wives, kids, boyfriends and pet's..With the Onion Bears returning home, no doubt the A&E will be busy tonight after their Christmas festivities in the city centre earlier..
World’s most successful club - Celtic FC.  I know a good painter if rangers need to paint over any signs that are Jo longer relevant 😉☘️
Celtic - 119 🏆 Rangers- 115 Sevco - 3
mentality. mentality. mentality 💚🇮🇪

YESSSSSSSSS GET THE FUCK INNNN WOSODIDIKDWK ☘️ ☘️☘️☘️🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Celtic fans saying Celtic didn't play well today. Rangers fans saying Rangers played brilliantly. Celtic still won. That's the gulf in class 🍀
two tin pot teams winning a micky mouse cup in a micky mouse league. Nothing to see here
Rodgers doing what he does.  MAKE RANGERS GREET AGAIN 💚
Ah jaysus, all the wee bears will be greetin into their cheap beer the night. ☘☘⚽⚽
Unlike the boring Manchester Derby this was a far more entertaining game…
The Greatest Scottish Derby I’ve ever seen between these two sides. The Greatest Scottish League Cup Final!
Get right in there bhoys🎉🍀👌
Laughing at Sevco is so enjoyable. Chuckle. YNRA.
captain failure has nightmares of Daizen every night lol
Celtic closing in on surpassing the combined trophy haul of the new Rangers and the old RFC, happy days!
Not a fan of either team, but that was a great game.
1:13 1:56 2:48 3:40 4:21 4:58 8:00
CELTIC THE BEST TEAM IN SCOTLAND
Maybe time for the the rangers to just sit back and realise at our worst we are still far superior! Never seen us so bad- but all good teams find a way to win
What a game rangers gave everything but today came to soon.  Well played celtic it was a good final
COME ON CELTIC.🔥.🍀.
Bye bye rangers
WHAT A FUCKING GAME 🎉🎉 COULDN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER
Sometimes you just find a way to win
The Belgium beale must stay
