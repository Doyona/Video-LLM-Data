Does anyone know who made this wheelchair? This design looks perfect. I'm looking for one for my dog!
He's a happy beautiful dog
❤❤❤❤❤ t
So precious fills my heart up ❤
Prob should have a leash on, just incase something bad happens
Where can i get a wheel chair like that for my dog
Aww so cute poor baby ❤
Your dog is adorable 🥰
Does San Diego allow dogs to be off-leash in public areas?
Her wheel is about to come of
But what is the leash for though😂😂😂
Meravigliosi
That is so sad because it is of his legs
❤❤❤

Unconditional♥️wonderful loving Mo ther♥️Beautiful lady♥️ this is steps to HEAVEN ♥️
Proof that dog power is greater than horse power.  Went from 0 to 100 in 5 seconds.
Give me my wheels mom I'm ready to go...❤❤❤
😢😢
How about keeping your dogs on leash’s🤷…one of em even has one on and you still let them go free!! If you cant have common courtesy for other people you shouldnt own a dog! Not everybody wants random dogs coming up to them
🙏🙏❤️
🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍♥️
I LOVE HIS LITTLE HAPPY JUMPS HES SUCH A LIL GOOF OMG

Imagine seeing this walking down the street, one dog has Hot Wheels and the other Doggo is running with his leash in his mouth!! These Dogs def have tons of personality!!
So awesome, are there little booties you can give him so his feet don't drag on the ground? Love this.
Fix the wheels please
God bless you 😢😢
The lead dog is just as excited as the wheel chair dog. You all are blessed.💖💖💖
Wow a life lesson from a dog. Even if the worst comes at you, you can always find happiness in something. Look at how happy that dog is. Probably doesn’t mind being in a wheel buggy.
❤❤❤
God Bless this happy Dog and his Family Masters and the other dog too. ... It's Pure Happiness when You See a handicapped dog Running like That 🐾🐶♥️.

Thank God first for the people that make different things for disabled animals and secondly I want to say THANK U to those people that take in and take care and love on these disabled dogs/animals and I wish that it was more people in this world that had hearts like that and last I will never understand why people get animals/dogs to just end up abusing them and not taking care of them and just to keep them in the corner or outside all day or locked up all day and it break my heart because I'm a huge animal lover and dogs will love you and stay loyal to you more than another human would and they will give you that love and loyalty until your or there dieing day so please if u r not ready to love, take care of and give your time then just don't get a dog/ animal and just consider getting some type of hobby or something, GOD BLESS....
God bless You
It’s heart warming to see people like this lady.
Bless that happy pup❤😊

How sweet.  But it is best not to have carpet in a home with a dog that had to drag its bottom on the floor.
Pure joy. Dogs live and love to run. Nothing happier than seeing a dog or horse run.  And this mom knows.
Heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time.
Veey kind. Cool. You sure toes aren't draggin on sidewalk?
Awesome. He could use some boots on his back paws to keep them from getting injured. He is a beautiful dog 🐕!
So precious 💕

OMG! Just TOO ADORABLE!
Oh so sweet ❤❤❤

How adorable is this.. 💕
I worked for a veterinarian I the late 80s. He was the expert canine orthopedist in our state. We had a basset hound who was hit by a car. Even my vet couldn’t help him so he reached out to someone and got a doggy wheelchair sent to us. It only took one day to teach the basset hound how to use it. Absolutely one of the most beautiful and gratifying experiences of my life. To see that dog go from being confined and depressed to being mobile and happy was amazing. The transformation was like night and day. It had such an impact on me that I doubt I’ll forget it even if I get Alzheimer’s.
AND YOU TALKING ABOUT GOD BLESSING THOSE USELESS ANIMAL YOU BETTER WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN SOUL BECAUSE WHEN JESUS COMES BACK WE'RE THE ONES WHOSE GOING TO BE JUDGED NOT THOSE USELESS ANIMAL
IF YOU HATE JESUS YOU CAN KEEP ON DISRESPECTING HIM BUT WHEN THE RAPTURE COMES WHERE WOULD YOU BE THE DEVIL HE WANTS YOU TO SUFFER AND BURN IN HELL BUT BECAUSE OF JESUS HE WON'T SECEDED.
TEN COMMANDMENTS 3 READS AS FOLLOWS   YOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD IN VAIN, FOR THE LORD WILL NOT HOLD HIM GUILTNESS WHO TAKETH HIS NAME IN VAIN.
ACCORDING TO TEN COMMANDMENTS NUMBER 3 THIS IS A SIN TO USE THE LORD'S NAME IN VAIN
AND YOU SHOULD NEVER USE THE LORD'S NAME IN VAIN WHEN IT COMES TO THESE USELESS ANIMALS BECAUSE THERE NO COMPARISON
AND WHO AND WHAT TOLD YOU THAT LIE DOGS ARE A BLESSING FOR SOME PEOPLE JESUS IS A BLESSING FOR ME AND MY CHILDREN ARE A BLESSING FOR ME
What a wonderful doggie and you're so awesome doggo mommy to care for him.  Delightful clip.❤
This is Priceless ❤❤
such a happy dog
❤❤❤
Wow amazing
Aww, bless. Honestly... But please buy him some booties. Just to stop those feets from scraping, is all. X

Man, San Diego is looking ROUGH these days. I remember visiting a couple of decades back & it was so insanely gorgeous everywhere.
I am so happy for her seriously. Dogs are so sweet
So sweet, Dogs are a true blessing for people. It warms my heart to see equipment made to assist a disabled pup, instead of just putting him down due to a matter of convenience!!!! Bless this lady!!! 🙏
That pup is amazing run run run
I was SO busy & happy watch- ing Scooty is it, that it wasn’t until I watched the video over and over that I noticed the other dog was holding his own leash like he was walking himself!! ha  hahaha. Too funny😄. They both gave me the “feel goods” 4 the rest of the night👍🏻.
Nothing but respect. ❤  Pets. Are. Family.
Shit as long as there is life there is hope
🙏🫶🙏
❤❤❤❤❤❤

😢😢😢😢
Q lindo 🎉
This is so precious. I was expecting the dog with the leash to be handled by the one in the wheelchair.

What a beautiful pup.  I had a pup who used a wheelchair....
Gracias por cuidarlos , ellos son buenos inteligentes y fieles hasta la muerte, lo que los humanos , no somos
Adorable! A friendly suggestion, paw booties for the back paws if they drag. But simply pure joy
God bless this family. They make this dog to enjoy life.
Why can’t we be like them ? Not impossible, we can learn from our young kids that are born with a disability or are disabled at a young age 😍
Бедный собака так бегает такой счастливый спасибо хозяйке❤❤❤❤

Anjing sayang sweety, bersyukur ada kursi roda untuk membantu dia berjalan, berterimakasih pada keluarga yg merawat, lega melihat mereka bermain ceria, ❤🙏
Perhaps the back legs should go into a little pouch to protect them.

God bless this mother for making running possible for this dog 😘
I had rescue Pitbull that was missing a back leg. He lived to be almost 17. I had to help him with stairs but there wasn't a lot of extra work. It's amazing how fast they adapt and overcome obstacles.

So wonderful to see. Thanks for this video ❤
Beautiful!!!!... But I was afraid they would try to cross the street, and the cars passing...🖐🏻😯🐕‍🦺🦮 "BE CAREFUL"!!!!
She’s waiting for the dog to run out in traffic and break. It’s two front legs this time. Let’s just talk about the other one that is complete and running with no human attached. I don’t think you should own dogs.
Pobresito!!! No pierde el entusiasmo por salir.a pasear,  aun en su condicion.
She's telling everyone I ain't letting my handicap stop me look out people I'm coming through. And the other one carrying the leash that's so cute !! Thank you for sharing.
Misty eyed here.
Cute widdle fwoofsters
The love and support in the dogs unfurry momma is sooo loud.
Si cute......❤

Ohhhhhhh 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

Di indonesia jangankan Hewan Anjing Cacat Dikasihani. Orang Difabel Saja Uang dari Mengemis Di Rampok Paksa Oleh Manusia-manusia Berhati Binatang. MeRampok.Maling.Begal Buat Lebaran dan Memberi Makan Anak Istri. BAROKAH KAH.?
I am spechless for that kind of heroes❤❤❤❤
Anjing-anjing ini Di Negara Bukan Mayoritas Islam itu Senang. Bahagia. dan Aman. Kalo Di Indonesia Mayoritas Beragama Islam Anjing nya Berkeliaran Bisa-bisa Di Bantai dan Di Bunuh. Anjing Bagi Orang yg Beragama islam kan Haram..
❤❤❤❤❤
❤
You’re the awesome one!
Wooow how happy he is ❤ God bless you !!
That other dog decided he was gonna carry his own leash
Great wheeled harness. It looks like the wheel is really loose on one side. I would hate to think that it might fall off during a run.
Oh my gosh make me so happy,thank you and blessings for you and famiyt🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🐶🐶
👍🙏🏼
her left wheel looks like it needs a tightening 🙏🏻

🇹🇯🇹🇯💕❤️🇹🇯🇹🇯
We all should learn from such wise and innocent creatures.  How would you look at life if you had those same disabilities? Would you be so happy and full of life like this precious pup if you had the same disabilities? We should learn from nature that to be full of life with abundant happiness is true life in spite of disabilities.  God bless his innocent creatures that could also be our teachers
I love how the other dog carries his lead and walks himself too 😂
Love love love love you both❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Not sure how long it’s been that your dog has been paralyzed, but a really good Chiropractor can fix him. I used to fix my own paralyzed dog and those of my patients too!
I have to be in a wheelchair too since I got a brain tumor now I am doing chemo rn
That's fantastic 😀 👏 😄
This dog is so cute!!
❤ Ahh so precious and both of your beautiful fur babies are the sweetest.  Thank you for sharing your video.

Looks like the wheel on the driver's side 4. The left side of that buggy needs to be tightened a tad bit.  It's flapping all over the place
Qué feliz es!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am so excited for you and your doggie's ❤

I could see the excitement on the dog face and once he got outside he was enjoying himself thank you to the lady for taking a disabled dog and d to the people who make the special wheelchair for the dog so he can get outside for some fresh air and exercise as well ❤❤

One of my dogs is paralyzed in her back legs after being hit by a car. Despite this, she's such an active girl. She can pull her behind up and walk on her front legs. Love my Lucy.
Very cool and helpful

Wow that’s awesome the freedom he looks like he feels wen he gets to run like a normal dog. They don’t feel sad for themselves it’s normal for him but us as humans r over here crying happy tears and feeling sorry for him.
Words can't explain how this enlightened my heart! This pup was so excited and thanks to his mom and whoever made the wheelchair this provided some freedom life for him. This was wonderful to watch.

Am I the only one with anxiety watching the dogs run off leash in a busy city. 😬 I think it's an amazing story , but maybe better told at a dog park or an open field where I know they are running around safely
I thought he was rubbing his a*s on the floor

❤❤❤❤❤
SWEET BABIES!!!  Let’s GOOOOO!!!! Zoomies!!!!!
omg melted my heart
My mom’s miniature dachshund had a slipped disk twice and was paralyzed in her back legs twice. The vet said both times she would never walk again. We got her a doggie wheelchair and she did great with it but both times, her back legs started working again. She had to keep up with her brothers” my cats”. After a couple of moths, she didn’t need the wheelchair anymore. She was running around my house again playing with her brothers. My mom said her dog coming to my house to play with her brothers is what inspired her to get better both times.  I took both of my cats who I got each the day they were born and bottle fed them grew huge. My mom lived 2 blocks away from my house and babysat my boys while I was at work or if I needed to run to town.   One day I took my boys to my moms to show her something. After they got lots of love from their grandma, she loved her grandcats. They settled down and went to play with my mom’s dog. They loved their big sister even though they grew well over 3 times her size, she was still the boss.  I put out a baby blanket that I had bought my moms dog several baby blankets, set her on it, each one of my boys grabbed a front corner of the blanket when my moms dog barked and started pulling her around my mom’s house on the blanket. Both my mom and I ripped all of the carpet out of our houses. Then my cat started running pulling the blanket and my mom’s dog layed down and they ran and ran pulling her. They took corners while running and she loved it! My mom thought it was so cute and clapped for them all. My mom named it magic carpet rides! It didn’t take both cats to pull her because my cats are huge and one can do it but my boys are 3 years apart in age. Neutered, get their shots, microchipped, have food allergies so get special food from the vet, I drink tap water, they only drink bottled water. They have to travel in a dog carrier that fits a black lab and are still squished a bit.  But they loved their sister, my moms dog and my boys have never ever had a fight and are always side by side do they both pulled the blanket with their sister on it. They would go pretty fast but Gracie, my mom’s dog loved it! No, I didn’t teach them to do it. They just started doing it on their own.  My mom was so happy to see it and so happy to see Gracie and my boys happy that she cried. It was wonderful to see my mom actually seeing what I had been telling her what they had been doing at my house.  My mom hugged both of my boys and told them she loved them. She had them stop so she could hug and thank them. She also hugged Gracie but had to put her back on the blanket because Cinder and Ember had the blanket in their mouths again and were growling. She put Gracie back on the blanket and off they went again. This went on for about an hour.   It made my mom smile and laugh.  Even when Gracie could walk and run again, she still loved her magic carpet rides.   I miss my mom and Gracie who both passed away last year.   I have 2 special boys. I’m so lucky God blessed me with them.
❤ oh my! This made my day❤❤ what a precious hotrod furbaby❤

Happy happy 🐶 🐶❤️🙌dogs !! Just be careful please 🙏 I see they run to the street , I used to do that for years thinking 💭 that my dog never run away or cross street… unfortunately one day there was a 🐿️ and my dog try to chase it to play with it and fight a car was coming so fast that didn’t see my dog 🥹😔 my Greco get kill at instant… I was devastated until today I feel was my fault for not see the danger coming !!❤

Que lindo animalito y qué buena persona❤
The wheel is loose
My thing is that whatever happened to that dog to cause its handicap, I'm just happy that the person that made the decision to NOT put the animal "to sleep" had the vision to let the animal live & enough love & determination to give thus dog a happy life despite it's handicap. There is NEVER TOO MUCH LOVE.  There has always been parents accused of being OVERprotective of there children & that can be a problem. But it is not possible to have too much love.
❤❤❤❤😊
What a great feeling if one has kind heart
.. Seeing that Son of a Bitch on wheels really touched my heart 😍... ...A Big salute to their owner 👍..
Дай Вам Бог вПомощ!!!😂❤❤❤❤❤

Appreciate these people give their time to care for these defenseless being ❤❤❤
Ah,Love You doggie😢

It's so wonderful to see that you don't discard one of God's creatures just because they are crippled. It's wonderful that you show compassion. I'm handicapped and I have a hard time navigating this world myself. It's hard to find anyone to even hold the door for you if you're on crutches these days
❤❤❤❤❤
Thank You❤
Oh love it to take care dog

Hey I left a like and they are so adorable 🥰
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
That is so wonderful. But please don't forget to put padding on his back paws so they don't get torn up
Why do the human owners of dogs (even cats) like to torture a "paralyzed" animal?? In this case a dog.decades ago when people (i.e. humans) had a pet dog that ended up like this they would have euthanized it to prevent needless suffering by the animal. Yes animals are accorded laws to prevent abuse which l think this video and others are a form of. Dogs & cats are pets not ones children that is just insane. Animals don't have "rights" as l said they are accorded protection under laws but not preventing a dog's suffering is akin to abuse
Vendita eres mujer, gracias Mar España

Feed the sweet baby a carnivore diet to keep the front legs healthy. My fur baby was lame in his back legs and vet said only surgery and he’d still be lame. I only changed his diet and he’s been running and playing since. ❤️❤️❤️❤️🙌🏻🙏🏼

So cute ❤❤❤❤❤
God bless you for your kind service❤
That person who was complaining about scare tactics………seems like the Democrats have gotten very good at those themselves.   Just saying, when they attack you for disagreeing with them…….what else would you call it?  I’ve always been a “live and let live” kind of girl.  Ill like someone, or not, based on how they treat me and mine.  I’ve never *had* to have friends agree with me.  But when people start trying to cram stuff down my throat I’m done.
That look of utter joy to be running.  That just made my heart melt.  Dogs are amazing.  They not only give us joy but they teach us to be joyful.  What a wonderful gift.
Nice video ❤❤❤
God bless you ❤❤
What love! Praise God for Persons like this😊 See how the other dog grabbed his leash ?😂

Polska lekarka Nelly Radwanowska wyleczyła kamertonami swojego psa tak sparaliżowanego. Ale robiła mu sesje kamertonami gdy miał świeży uraz. Po prostu wrócił po kilku dniach nieobecności w takim stanie do domu. Przykładała mu kamertony do ciała, gdzie miał uraz.

May God bless you forever 🙏🙏🙏🙏 I love dogs. I have four!
I love that
Please get those wheels aligned to enable him maneuver efficiently...as he is on a front wheel drive. If you could put a small differential on the rear axel, that would help. He would be faster than a four legged dog....He's already quick....it's really thoughtful of you to have him enjoy his life.....very considerate. I am happy that he gets his share to go out with his friends...Bravo!❤❤

당신은 너무아름다운 사람 입니다
Обращаюсь к нашим любителям потыкать правилами заграничными: ну и где тут Намордники? И где тут Обязательные поводки? И где Выгул Только на спецплощадках? И заметьте, прохожие не вопят, как у нас : ой! Они нас съедят! Уберите собак!  Похоже, наша Россия, как была ( со времён перестройки) страной третьего мира, так и остаётся. 😢
awe ❤
God bless the owners  who take care of him very well . 🙏 ❤ Dog's  all are very happy .
Selamlar sevgiler harika insanlar, sizleri görünce sevinc gözyaslarim akti ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

She is very cute, she is Angel. God bless you
I imagine this dog was injured by colliding with a vehicle? So incredibly sad but it is vitally important to train your dogs to position themselves away from vehicles when outside.  My dogs are off leash all the time and know if they see a car they move themselves into the woods until it passes. It's best to get a puppy and start cery young but any aged dog can learn. Train your dogs people and learn how to train your dogs! Great videos all over the internet about the subject

At first I thought his butt was itchy and was doing the typical doggy booty drag but then I saw his prosthetics 😢😢 the doggy is very fortunate that he has good owners who care
Cute but shouldn't set an example of how to just let the dogs wonder in the streets. I believe you have a dog park or something for that.
Happy Doggy.. God bless you for bringing smile on the Lil souls face.. loved watching Lil one running with joy
Very touching 😮😮❤❤❤

I cringed when you let them take off on a big city sidewalk. Its not worth risking the one with wheels (no brakes!) in that traffic area.
Precious precious ❤❤❤
It takes a special person to love and care for a special needs pet! Thank you for giving this sweet furkud such a fun, wonderful life! Just a note from something I saw about doggos in wheelchairs - they put socks or boots on their paralyzed feet so they don't get scraped if they drag on the ground. Blessings to you both! ❤

What a beautiful fur baby! Who ever invented wheelchairs for animals are the best. They can still have a good life. What a lovely sight!
You are a angle ❤
Can you give him like a sock or a protective brace for his Right back leg? It scrapes the ground very often when he uses the wheelchair.
I'm so dumb. I thought he had a special talent to walk like that 😔
God bless you
Großartig
😂🎉
Your dogs are so cute and you are such a good dog mommy. ❤
Not making fun at all..  he never has dingleberries huh? Lol
So sweet
Back paws need some protection!!!!!!
❤️🙏❤️🙏💪💗💯
So he just does the bus scoot everywhere he goes almost hurt on the grout lines hopefully if you have hard wood and it's got a nice thick coat on top so he don't get a poor splinter
You are a true hero, taking care of a dog with special needs. Both are so happy!!!!!
I wish they woukd sell these assisted wheelchairs in vet shops ❤
❤😂❤❤
❤❤❤❤
Appreciating the little things in life❤ going outside for a walk!
He is not disabled he just has worms 🤦‍♂️
20 years ago, I had an Akita/Newfoundland mix named Maximillian who, when he was about 14,  had hip dysplasia and couldn't use his back legs.  We got him a doggie wheelchair and although he was in tremendous pain, it improved his quality of life in his last few years.  He was happy to get outside.  I miss that boy.  He was a great dog.  I'm getting teary.
He needs a slipper on that foot that's dragging
Absolutely beautiful
He just can't contain his excitement!  Beautiful.
Cool owner
Love this video!  Give your babies a kiss from. me!
Beautiful!!
Well done 😅
Omg I thought he was wiping his ass on the rug 😅
Ahhh😢❤
🥲🥲🥲 why would a brown, reasonably well adjusted man tear up at this video. May God bless you ma’am. That dog is so happy.
God bless you❤
Looks like some suspension is in order for the back of that lill doggy cart
I thought his ass was itching for a second, until. 😳🤦🏻‍♂️😍 🦽 🐕
You need to put boots on the back legs. The dog cannot feel any damage from dragging the paws and dragging will probably cause some damage.
Keep them on a leash not running around near a busy street. Common sense goes out the window when all you want is views and likes.
I thought he was wiping his ass on the carpet. I almost lost my shit
Happy doggies!
❤ & prayers
Pobresito me da pena pero el va feliz con su carrito no hay quien lo pare 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️
Bless their hearts.  Precious.
❤❤😊😊
So cute
Loving it
Ok i was bout to say you need to change that rug 😂
Thank you for all you do to make the pips happy and loved!!!❤❤
Please protect his back feet.
Poor fogi with an enjel

I love this! ❤❤❤❤
Omg that is so incredibly cute!  So great that he can go outside and run with his dog friends!
No offense. But isn't it dangerous to let the dogs run loose, especially in the intersections? Seems like another accident waiting to happen
What a wonderful thing to witness, Such a loving wonderful Doggy owner, Perhaps a great addition to your Doggy wheelchair Would be some booties for his rear paws so he doesn't scrape up his little toes.
You a great person for doing this God bless you
Oh what a sweet dog😊
❤💯🐕🙂
He is so happy and running so fast! You are a beautiful person, these dogs are blessed❤
This is the sweetest video I have ever seen.  Look at that SMILE!!!! God bless you!

Gli animali, nell'handicap, se vengono aiutati tornano a godersi la vita, non soffrono di traumi di amputazione o altro. Vivono come se in realtà  nulla fosse accaduto. Non si sentono inferiori .
My heart just melts with love and joy.  Thank you.

If they wanna run and be off leash, take them to a dog park, what its meant for not running in the middle of the street and they could run out in the middle of the road and get hit by a car

bloody ace, fab, MARVELLOUS...
Здесь хорошо и правильно сделана тележка, собаке удобно, и хозяйка быстро справляется. Мы своей тоже покупали, но сделана была плохо. Здесь колеса под наклоном, у нашей были прямые, впрячь собаку было мучением, и ей было неудобно. И конструкция была громоздкая и тяжелая. Кто-нибудь изучил бы вопрос, спинальников среди домашних животных много, спрос бы был. Голова нужна и руки.
Respect!!!
Nice best
Came tears in my eyes...oh my God so much love ❤❤❤❤

Es un herrero y mucho muy hermoso gracias por ayúdalo a Ser feliz muchas bendiciones y que dios te bendiga siempre 🙏😘👏👏👍
That is way too awesome✝️❤️🙏🏻God bless you all!
That's cool and all but the bottom line is you need to be controlling your animals...... Screw your video. You need to be holding on to those leashes.... If you want to let them run once you get to inappropriate place then sure, but it's incredibly irresponsible to just let them run down the sidewalk
❤❤❤
So cute
❤ génial
Kudos to whomever invented that awesome device. To the owners of these wonderful dogs, we love you. When this sweet dog hit the sidewalk I couldn't believe how fast he could run. He's so happy and everybody better move out of the way ❤
That dog knows its got the best life despite the poor buggers health this is what humans are made of real problems solved by the simplist of ideas none of this cultural bs well done to the owners for giving the time and effort to make a happy dog nice 1
Dios te bendice por ser tan hermoso ser humano. Ese perrito tiene calidad de vida, gracias a ti. Bendita eres.❤❤❤❤❤

This makes me happy cry 🥲 I have an 11 yo pug, and she sometimes has a hard time getting on her back legs, especially when she has been sitting or lying for a longer time period. It pretty much looks like this dog before he gets into his wheelchair. However, so far it never takes very long before she can walk properly again. This gives me so much hope for a couple more years with her should it get worse at some point ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😢
That carpet must smell wonderful.
I need this for my pet can you tell you where you got this thanks.
Sooo cute❤
I need the the handicap wheelie thing for my dog.  She needs the wheels in the front as her hind legs work but has a congenital defect in her front legs.

I really should read the onscreen text and watch more than 3 seconds of a video before i start to type a comment… …i was just about to say “as soon as ive finished wiping my arse on your carpet you may come with me for a walk stupid human” which would of been disastrous! I would of been hung drawn and quartered and my parts hung from the 4 metaphorical corners of the WWW! …Just like the time i foolishly stated i dont find women with armpit hair attractive on TWITTER during JANUHAIRY!!! 😮😮😮😮 DUN DUN DUUUUN!! 😂😂😂
The Greatness seen here is Godliness..  It could be any living thing..  where we need each other..  ❤❤
الرحمة لا تتجزأ

Many animals on this planet are living a more comfortable life than humans. A true hypocrite world we are living in
Super ❤❤❤❤❤
How to apply the brakes?

He's a pro with his wheel chair so cute
Glad the dog can experience movement but you can't let them run around on the street without the leash.      In your hand.  Understand?
Terimakasih orang baik.. Sdh menyayangi dan memberikan yg terbaik buat anjing ini.. ❤❤❤
💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
👍🏿👏🏿❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏿🙏🏿
This is so great. Thank you for making that dog wheel chair.
Como olera ese tapete
Dios bendiga a quien ayuda a los animales
For those folks who don't know why dogs scoot, here's a recommendation to ask your vet about having your dog's anal sacks expressed (dont' trust the groomers!). It can be very painful for them and even lead to infection.
This is so beautiful! I have a cat that used to be paralyzed but for some miracle he was healed❤  this really touched my heart!
Awesome ❤😊
Q felicidad muestran esos angelitos.
❤
Thank you so much for make dog can feel happy and he can play,running outside with friend

God bless you I know what is have a dog in a wheelchair it’s not that easy every day is different is a challenger every single day. Keep going everything you do every day God would pay.😊

Awesome, God bless you💕
It ‘s so cute how excited the dog gets about going outside. It ‘s special to be able to see a disabled dog be able to run and play. I have one question, why is the other dog carrying a leash with him.
Nonton berulang-ulang menyenangkan
Que lindo cuanta felicidad sienten los dos 🥰🥰🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺❣❣
Love this little families ❤❤❤❤❤❤
A felicidade dela mostra que vive bem e é amada. Isso não  tem preço

Shocked is not on a leash and so close to the road!
God bless you, it is because of people like you we still have rain and food in this world
God bless this owner for choosing a disabled dog. I was by the vet for the 1st time in my life today and i saw how expensive these animals are ! Wow
They even take care their pets but they don't take care their own parents. Animals can get more priority than humans.
Good❤❤❤
God bless you

If you dont want that dog to lose the other two legs, or the other to cause an accident, keep your dogs on a leash and leash on your hand(s) when you take them to the streets
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢Nice unta te. E sliding ni tanang window. No need na mag jamb. Mao nay usao karon diri sa window ang sliding
God knows our hearts, with such kindness even without prayers you can make it to heaven because God is unconditional love not a selfish, hypocrite and heartless God. This is why most white people don't pray because they're already godly and commit less sins especially to animals and fellow men but most of us the blacks are quite an opposite that's why we're always in fear and quite certain we can't make heaven without prayers, we pray fervently and act contrary to God's words. Imagine currently I've an uncle who is a Minister of Energy, an uncle who is also an ambassador to UAE, an uncle who is also a PA to President and other uncles who are also in other prominent positions and there are people in our family whom even this dogs are doing better than and yet they're carrying prestigious religious titles Like Alhaji and Sheikh and highly believe they will make heaven, black lives can never matter because blacks kills blacks even morethan how whites kills black😂😂😂
He needs little shoes to protect his back toes from scraping on the ground
😂😂😂😂😂😂

دستان شما دستان فرشتگان خداوند است که اینگونه یک حیوان فلج را خوشحال میکنید احسن به آنکسی که این ویلچر را درست کرده و دم شما هم گرم که انقدر با عشق به آنها لطف میکنید . آجر شما با خداوند متعال .وقتی دیدم چقدر من خوشحال شدم وای بحال آن حیوان که چقدر شوق رفتن بیرون را داشت و وقتی ویلچر را بستی بهش انگار که دوتا پا بهش دادید. ❤❤❤ دمتان گرم دستت طلا . انشاءالله خداوند انقدر بهت بده که ندونی چجوری جمع کنی و خرج این فرشته ها هم بکنی .❤❤❤

How is letting your dogs run uncontrolled along road where cars can be backing out or pulling into their driveways. Seems kind of careless wirh safety wuth both the dogs and people driving who might swerve to avoid hitting the dog.

My dear wonderful person.  I am lying in bed with yet another fractured vertebrae.  Wasn't suppose to happen but it did.  I am very lucky to have doctors who are very concerned and are not ignoring me or my fracture.  Not a good day but after seeing your incredibly uplifting video I thank you for your incredible kindness to the dog you gave a second life to.  He could not have looked happier, more full of life. Both doggies look so delighted with being alive !!!!! Thank you !!!!!

Спасибо добрым людям. Завести такого пса инвалида я думаю очень трудно. Дай бог вам здоровья и долгих лет жизни.

As a wheelchair user, I can't tell you how great it is to be in my chair and be able to keep up with everyone who walks and go all the places they go. My wheels are the great equalizer!
This is called true happiness ❤❤❤
복  받으세요
That looked like a lot of fun!🤗🍀
Si diverte,,, e importante  Brava❤
❤
The way he grabbed the rope from your hands lol
C'est incroyable comme chez le chien malgré son handicap il a gardé sa joie de vivre grace a des personnes qui savent prendre soin de lui avec beaucoup d'amour.
God love you for caring about his creations ❤
It kinda looked like you need to get the dogs back legs up higher and protected from moving side to side.The right leg was dragging the ground and has to be scrapping its poor paws,/ nails.Other than taking care of those minor problems,who ever the inventor was of this wheelchair for dogs I commend you sir!! It definitely brings the dog joy and happiness.God bless you.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💪💪💪💪
What if he gets under a car and won't be able to stop😬
To see the joy and excitement on his face. So heart felt to watch. ❤❤
God bless these precious beautiful dogs. ❤❤❤❤

I am so happy for that and so glad that she can run and have a fun life. So glad for her good job with that dog. Thank you for her.
You should elevate and restrain the rear legs so they don't drag or catch.
It's amazing ❤❤❤

Oh sweet babies.  I thought the first one had a terrible case of worms until you broke out the wheels.
Q belleza de felicidad
❤😮🎉 great 😊
Amazing to watch 😊😊😊
This is like exactly what happened to my friend’s dog after getting ran over by a motocross dirt bike motorcycle as the dirt bike hopped over the curbside and ran over his dog Spud ( a half breed fox terrier dog )  who was just laying on the ground resting. My friend had been bullied. He couldn’t press charges due to unknown identity of the rider. And couldn’t fight back due to fear. According to him, the rider, with a tan denim jacket and an open face helmet appeared to be laughing and even looked back at him smiling then quickly rode away. Luckily the dog survived but broke his hind legs. To this day from 2 years ago, the dog can only hobble on his two front legs. Thank you for sharing the video. I’m saving it for my good friend. Perhaps this could help his dog.
Parece fuas crianças correndo felizes.
It make me feel good the owners take so much time with him and he shows the love more than some people do thier own children ,i watched this vidio numerous times and cried
He is so excited to go for a walk ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Thank you for sharing this video. Special need dogs are simply amazing , life doesn’t stop them. They simply go on and adapt! They make great pets so if you consider adopting a dog and see one that uses a wheelchair know you will love  them just as much, sometimes even more then the 4 legged healthy dog! ❤❤❤❤
Люди с золотим сердцем❤
love it when dogs do zoommies 🫶🏼💕 that wheelchair is a lifechanger 💕🥰🙏🏼
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
Que anjinho lindo ❤
Maybe don't let your dog offleash!!!!!!
Meanwhile I just think how foolish can someone be to let dogs RUN FREE on a busy street so close like this?  There can be ANY situation where the dog will lash out over the streets and get hit by  a car. especially wheelchair dogs that aren't mobile and fast enough to get away. I'm glad my city has a strict leash-rule
Ya ,  Allah .
Cosita!!!......está que brinca por salir a pasear!!!😅
God Bless You ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢
💗💗💗
Nossa como corre da gosto de ver ele correndo e só felicidade

Respect 🙏 to the Owner of this Dog 🐕 who really takes care of him.
Something melting 😘
Great job fur mama!
Great! Left wheel is loose!
❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The left wheel is about to fall off. I used to have a wheelchair for my dog from that company and they obviously have not corrected that problem. The rod on that side is not threaded in the right direction so the wheel eventually flies off.   You can see it loosening as the dog takes off to run at the end.
He's giving b boy vibes ❤
GBU so sweet
❤❤❤
Ngl he got me on the first 2 second

You are not a human ...  You are a real existence god❤
Good design!
Nice..❤❤❤
He needs a little step / brace at the back to rest his feet and stop them dragging on the ground - potential for wounds / sores. Otherwise love it, he's sooo happy😂😂😂
❤❤❤
What an Angel you are to undertake the responsibility of a handicap pooch. It's wonderful to see him running and still enjoying his life.He was ready for his attachment and took off like an ordinary pup would. May God's blessings prevail in your home. You are absolutely wonderful!

I LOVE GOLDEN'S. My first and only DOG had to be put 👎🏽 I was 4 when I got her on my B'day and My SWEET 16 she had to be put to sleep. That was in 1976! I never celebrate b'days nor ever wanted another Dog since she looked at me and cried, licking my tears and I was licking hers too, I begged GOD to take me with her, I don't want her to be lonely. I'm 64 n I think about her and BREAK down PAUSE PLZ 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 QUEENIE I Love n MISS you

This mDe..😢
Bless that precious Gods creatures heart.
When my Rottweiler couldn’t leap up into the back of my SUV, he learned that I would grab his hind limbs and lift him up so that he could enter the compartment where he could safely accompany me to my/our destination. As he grew older, I acquired a lower vehicle where he could get in next to me for our trips. He loved being able to protect me no matter where our journey dictated. I miss him!
👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a fantastic idea for that poor dog
Animals (dogs) do not feel sorry for themselves. They just look for the pleasures that their humans can provide.
Здорово!!!
Se ve feliz de poder correr❤
What an amazing dog  and I’m loving his dog sibling and Mama😁👍🏻
I thought he had WORMS UNTIL I SAW THE SCOOTER..  LOVE ANIMALS AND THIS FUR BABY IS SO BEAUTIFUL...back in the days before artificial help, there would be no way that this animal would have any way but being put down.. glad that  some intelligent person saw a better way to extend this BABY'S LIFE SO HE CAN CONTINUE TO BE THE LOVE OF THIS FAMILY......
Maravilha.  Qta alegria....❤❤❤❤

It's good to be happy our pets get help. But let's not think they have same value as humans. How about dust mites that are injured, should we care about their health too? Cockroaches, ants, mice, etc. All have purposes. Pretty animals have purposes... All are good... Created for man but aren't humans, created in the image and likeness of God.  Atheists, etc: I'm smart, you're wrong.  Me: your views are provisional too. So how did you become right?
❤❤❤😊
Que le sucedió a ese perrito bello, es hermoso, y su compañero también.
That was so adorable!!
In Indonesia we have a pet accupuntur doctor. My dog paralyzed too because she always sleep in bathroom. And one morning she can:t walk again. She 12th years old. We took to accupuntur doctor. After 5x terapi n accupuntur she can walk again.  The doctor`s name is Drh TATANG
Nothing spicy ! Did he really say that 😡🤯
❤❤❤
Que lindo e o dono abençoado lindo gesto
Thank you for your care. God bless.❤
❤❤❤❤❤
She's so ready to go outside and so happy such a sweet puppy😊
Que belleza, que energia el de silla de ruedas hermosos 😊😊😅
💓💓💓 🤗🤗🤗
Oh mi perrito se quedó inválido de sus patitas traceras por un año nunca pude hacerle su silla de ruedas porque tenía artrosis en sus patitas delanteras lo cuide fue feliz pero se complicó su salud tuve que dejarlo partir ya ocho días de su ausencia y lo extraño mucho.
❤😊loved the video. Keep it up pup!😊❤
At first glance, I thought this dog was butt rubbing but now I can see that it’s much more inspirational than that lol. This little dog has a wonderful life and his owner is an amazing person for allowing this dog to live again.
真的遇到好的主人，毛小孩真的很幸福😊

❤❤❤
They way animals are important to some, I wish so much and much more importance is attached to humanity.  That is love.  But some of these people exhibit some degree of hatred towards others either by colour, region, tribe, belief or others.  Let love lead
surly you could add some socks to keep the back legs from dragging on the ground?

Wonderful freedom! ... but watch out for people backing out of their driveways. They could hit your dogs.
Anyone else laugh at the very beginning of the video and then felt guilty for laughing when you realized the puppy was paralyzed?
…*sigh*💗🥰🐶Dogs🐶💗🥰 It won’t be Heaven without them🩷🌷
This has GOT to be @super_scooty, right? what a complete joy she is!
😅 que lindo eres Dios Todopoderoso te ha de bendecir x causarle mucha alegría a este hermoso perro ni en su situación se opaca deberíamos de aprender de su alegría

Прохожие с улицы прямиком пойдут в полицейский участок   и напишут заявление, что собаки бегают по улице без намордника и со спущенным поводком. И без хозяина рядом. Это же США ребята. Там так и делают, чтобы жизнь медом не казалась.

I the only thing I was wondering was and I love the wheelchairs for the doggies was why she didn’t have the wheelchair available to the dog in the house why was the dog having to scoot on the floor? You know it’s easier just to let the dog roll around the house in the wheelchair all the time.

You should put caster type wheels on there. For your dog to turn, he hast to basically drag the thing. Where is the wheel spun around he could move much easier. So put some new wheels on there and your dog. Will appreciate it.

This is what humankind CAN do. But we choose the bicker over each other's sex, the colour of skin, beliefs and man-made borders.   Aliens will judge us harshly.
Cuando está corriendo, ver la cara de felicidad del perro es impagable!
Le ben de subir un poquito las patas traseras para que no se le raspen con el semento por favor graciad
It melt my hart! 😢😂
A felicidade que ele tem em poder brincar 😊😊
Would it be unsafe to add a pouch for the legs? Or is them dangling along ideal?
Great job mam

Good work
she is so cute
So cute woman Cute dog
I worry about his/her back nails wearing down too much and becoming painful. Ive seen other disabled doggies that have little straps on the back of their wheels to lift back and up on their back feet so they not only dont scrape but are out of the way. But im sure the owner knows this and has made the decision not to do that for a reason. So glad this pup has so much life left in him/her.
And away he goes!!
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Kebaikanmu tidak bisa di ucap dg kata kata..anda hebat❤
You are very kind hearted person. God Bless you.
I like how people give way to the dogs.😊

I’ll fix those wobbly wheels for free !!
Just look at the face of the dog ❤. All the happiness in the world right there...
You know I want to pay for this dog cuz God will make those dogs legs well he healed me from a disease that was supposed to paralyze me and kill me but look at me now I can walk talk run eat and I wasn't even supposed to eat I was supposed to have a feeding tube but look at me now I'm walking and talking and the doctors don't know why but you know I just pray God does for this dog in Jesus name and remember guys don't forget the primary paint job because Jesus loves you and he died for you and repenting is repenting for your sin to God because without the shedding of blood there is no life and forgiveness of sins and if you like to be safe just say this and father God in the name of Jesus Lord I repent of all my sins I dedicate my life to you and I admit that I  I'm a sinner in need of a Savior and Lord I make you the Lord and savior of my life before I can do this on my own and I know that I need to get right with you Lord and Lord I pray that you help me live the life that you want me to live and in Jesus name Amen to know this you are saved by the blood of Jesus and you're on your way to heaven and forgiven by God because of what Jesus has another cross but now you must deny yourself pick up your cross and follow Jesus you have to live this life daily you can't just pray for her once and repentance and expect to go to heaven when you die you have to live this life daily and you must so guys just get right with God because if it wasn't for my mom praying for me I would have been dead God save me from committing suicide and he healed me from a disease that was supposed to kill me so guys God is real he's not God just to be used for blessings he's a gone to comfort you to help you for you to serve him because he did everything for you but yet you still want to reject them so come on guys he's a good God and since he's a good God he must punish sin so guys tomorrow is in promise it's better to get right with God now rather than later
...GRATIDÃO GRATIDÃO GRATIDÃO...LOVE LOVE LOVE...DEUS DEUS DEUS...AMÉM...

Did yoh make that wheelchair for your furbaby? It looks easy to make there is so many animals out there who would love one of those. So freaking awesome how easily your furbaby runs.
This is the best thing I saw today

God Bless his Lil Heart He is as Happy as a lark You would never know he had a disability.  Thank God for whomever came up with this ingenious idea
May God bless who created this wheelchair 🦽 and God bless you the owner of the dog 🐕 ❤❤❤❤
When you place a leash on your dog, you must hold the leash and stay in control so the dog does not get hit by a car coming out of a driveway, or get attacked by a territorial dog in the neighborhood. Those dogs could knock down an elderly person or a cyclist or cause an accident. Always remain in control of your dogs out in public.
God Bless You😢🙏🙏🙏🙏
❤❤❤
Animal not allowed to stay in home
Mental don't waste your time with animals , if you have time to lot of homeless people laying on road go and help

You should know that it's dangerous letting your dogs run free on the streets especially if the dog is disabled and it's running towards you with 35 tons of steel attached to his body unavailable to stop...

God bless you
The sheer look of excitement on that dogs face and how it just lets you guide her back legs into the frame. Such a bond.
Love this but you should have the leash on both dogs. Traffic and pedestrians are right there. Keep these BLESSINGS safe.
❤
Bless... that hurts my heart.
That dog sure has put some miles on them tires! Theyre about to fall off! Lmfao! I love this so much❤
ياالله كم هو سعيد ❤❤❤❤❤❤

Wow look at him go!!! God bless him❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💖💖💖💖💖😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️💕💕💕💕💕
น่ารักที่สุด ขอบคุณผู้มีจิตใจดี
There is a big design flaw. Either the dangling legs needs to be kept a little above on a ledge , or the ground clearance should be increased  by any means. Increase the size of wheels or increase the height of the mount or that sling where the dog is connected. The legs hitting uneven places is disturbing.
He didn’t even wait to see if he/she was in all the way yet he just said  “Get me in , get me in ….. hurrry pwwaeese….. ok! Thanks MOM!! BYE! Peace ✌️ out! Lol …. “Zooooom” And he’s/she outta here!  Wow….. that is the the cutest lil pair of doggy brothers or sisters rt there!  And the mom how sweet she is ! He straight up was like Dog: ok…, get me in get me in ! Hears “Click”  and the race is off….. ZOOOOMMMM, 🌬️💨💨🌪️oh ya byyyyyyyyeeee!!!!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
The pure joy of this dog zooming down the sidewalk is a beautiful sight behold! Love it! ❤

Thankful for the wheelchair, but that pup needs paw protectors.
At first I thought this dog was just dragging its bum across the carpet but then seeing the dog being put in a wheelchair really made my heart sink❤
How wonderful!

Que bello😊❤ Dios bendiga sus animalitos siempre 🙏
😢
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Creo que es muy peligroso dejarlos correr sin correa, se mira que no tendría tiempo de detenerlos si los perros deciden cruzan la calle por donde transitan los autos. Sería muy bueno traerlos con correa para evitar un accidente 😁💞🙏
WONDERFUL !!!
I LOVE THIS PERSON!!!
You are amazing
DIOS LA BENDIGA MUCHO 🙏 x darle tanto cuidado y amor 🐕‍🦺🦮🥰😇♥️  Es MUY FELIZ 🤩

aaaaawe.... those wheels needs some upgrade.
Oh my gosh, this bought tears to my eyes.
Freedom! Reminds me of when my (then) 2 year old got her first wheelchair. She was just so happy to be moving, on her own and free. So happy that animals have them, too.
Thank you to the inventor for giving these animals their quality of life and freedom back. Thank you too pretty mom for caring for your babies. 🙏🏽🥰❤
Thank you for taking care of God’s creation and not giving up.
tq for adapting paralyzed dog and sharing your love
Happy happy puppy!❤❤❤❤

You are such an angel ❤
My poor dog lost mobility due to old age. He was 16, but still had a lot life in him. However, we had to put him down since his back legs were too weak for him to move around. It’s sad, but I am glad your dog can still enjoy life with his wheel harness.
Ganz schön schnell 😊❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are an amazing person!
So cool

I will rescue another dog one day, but I'm not sure I could do it from a shelter. I'd take them all home. And I'd have like two dozen dogs in wheelchairs.

I thought the dog had worms at first, only to find out she's a paraplegic!
People who adopt special needs animals and help them live their lives to the fullest deserve a special place in heaven. It takes patience, work, understanding, and care beyond the average norm. Blessings to all animal rescuers, protectors, and lovers.
Lovely 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

You have given these beautiful ANGELS a chance to be free to run and play.  My deepest THANKS for your great gift of LIFE AND LOVE. ✝️🙏💗😇🦸‍♂️👫🦸‍♀️💕🐕💞🐕‍🦺😇🙏✝️

What a sweet wonderful dog owner! ❤️
Got a little dust in my eyes watching this, that doggy couldn't have been any happier !  Please spoil him and let him sit on the couch, and give him gentle little nose boops !
Long live that darling doggy, and love to the owner.😊
شكرا لمن صنع هذه العجلات لمساعدة هذه الحيوانات العاجزة الله وحده سيجازيك على صنيعك❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
bacağına masaj yap her gün çok tatlı ya❤❤❤
Que bonito ver su felicidad cuando ve la  silla y verlo correr sintiéndose libre 😊❤❤
It's amazing she's supportive of her dogs, but the leash is kind of pointless if she doesn't use it. She's letting them run free near the road.
Is he dragging his back feet? They will get all scraped up
❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍
Loved
I'm so glad that baby can still fly!!
It's good to have friends

Lindo mesmo . esse pequena cadeira de rodas é vida para pet que não pode caminhar com suas pernas e patas. Parabéns por tanto cuidado com seu cão.😘 Embora a cadeira só possa ser usada por um período, ela é fundamental para as caminhadas👏👏👏👏👏👏
足引きずってて大丈夫なのかな？高さ合ってなくないウォウウォウ

Sorry, but when you are on a public sidewalk, you can't let your dogs walk by themself. You could disturb other people and the dogs can run into a car.
💓
God bless you 💛
What an absolute sweetheart, she deserves that great life that she has now!
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
You know you are the best people in this world,i thought i let u know 💞💞💞
Que bueno q dentro de su condición física no ha perdido la alegría q siente cuando va de paseo con su equipo de ruedas...además bien por ella q saca de su preciado tiempo para dedicarselos a sus hijos de 4 patas...q se adoran con toda el alma! Ya q forman parte de la familia para aquellos q entendemos lo q significa sentir el amor perruno! Saludos desde PR!

He needs some protection fir right rear foot. Otherwise it will be having some injuries, can lead to infection and sepsis. Life threatening  situation
Now I feel bad, I was thinking “why he wiping his ass on the mat >:(“ 😔
God bless you
That left wheel looks a little loose and wobbling side to side. I would check that nut on the outside of the wheel and confirm it is secured.
❤😊❤😊❤😊 This just made my day. How happy they all were🥰🙏
Me encanta ver felices a los perritos como él.

I was about to say she needed to worm her dog because alot of dogs with worms will drag their hind end like that in an attempt to relieve the itching but im glad it turned out as it did. Doggo looked so happy to be running free again. Good on you for getting the dog-chair for her

I wonderful family... I think that this is thing... Very important
My dog has myasthenia gravis, one day he suddenly couldn’t walk. We went to the hospital they kept him for 4 days. Thankfully the medication he’s on now lets him walk 😢 I can’t tell you how hard it is to have a sick dog. Praises to you for persevering and looking after this holy creature. No one will ever love you the way your dogs do. ❤ it’s fricking tough and your whole live revolves around your puppies but man is it rewarding to see them thrive and adjust their life style habits ❤❤❤❤❤
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💜🩵💜🩷💚😀😀😀😀😀👍👍👍👍👍👍
❤❤❤❤❤❤
His happiness really puts a smile and a tear in my eyes!"🥰☺️🫶🌍you go boy "

Бедный пёсель. Спасибо людям, что помогаете ему жить. Уменьшаете него страдания
Omg I feel bad I wish he can walk again poor dog 😢he deserve to go out n have fun running around like a free dog

Adding hot wheels makes that a HOT DOG!

Running free on a busy main road? Heck no. Take them to a rural area for that. Yikes.
As someone who was chased by a dog this video is traumatizing for me. Leash your dogs PLEASE
Merci pour ce beau moment, vous égayez ma matinée.Qu'il est agréable de les voir gambader et d'être heureux , que le handicap ne soit plus un frein. Merci aussi aux ingénieurs, prothésistes, ergonomistes etc qui facilitent la vie de nos compagnons, notre famille. Cool :-*   Et merci à vous une leur offrir une belle vie.
الله يعطيك الجنه ان شاء الله يا رب
I can see in this dog's face that he is very Happy to go out because he knows he can ran as fast as he could by using his Wheelchair. So awesome😁 i could feel the dog's happiness while running outdoors. May GOD Bless the Owner & his/her family for taking good care of his Pets especially providing him with the wheel👍👍👍👍👍💕🐾💕🐾💞🐾💕
Nice ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is the sweetest thing I've seen today.  Thank you for enabling this dog to be free again.
Fantastici cuccioli 😢😅😅😅😅😅❤

ZOOMIES!!! My God that rascal gets around. So heartwarming to see!
Сколько радости и благодарности за возможность двигаться😢
Amore bello ❤️❤️❤️
I have a Pekingese who has had back surgery.  She is still paralized but there is hope she will recover.  If she doesnt I hope she can do as well with wheels as this beautiful dog does.  When she could walk she was always on a leash outside and will always be in the future.  I think it could frighten someone to have two dogs running down the sidewalk toward them and in most cities leashes are required  by law.
❤🎉
Such a good way to encourage the dog to try moving those back legs, too!
Adorable ❤❤
❤
شكراً لمن فعل هذا ❤
Oh, when I first watched this, I thought the dog was just rubbing his butt against the carpet on purpose😂
Thank you!
AWESOME ❤❤❤
❤❤❤
❤❤❤
If wife's taken care husband 1% than this Dog, maximum divorce case's will reduce.
That dog better be careful launching down stairs like that, he could end up a paraplegic.
😂 That puppy was ready to go, flew down the stairs and out the gate like nothing ❤
Hermosos y felices ❤
Trimakasih orang yang baik hati ... Janganlah karena dia lumpuh engkau biarkan , aku percaya engkau orang yang baik ... ❤❤❤❤❤ Tuhan Yesus Memberkati mu ...

I love how they were so excited as they took over the sidewalk and paid no attention to the two gentlemen who stepped out of their way as they both ran past with the innocence of 2 toddlers..😂❤😂❤
❤❤❤
Such a sweet baby ❤
Awesome thanks for stepping up 👍😎
You have made a wonderful job for that dog. Every virtue will be count on the day of judgment but have you ever imagine that the people of gaza they human on earth same like us were dieing due to lake of food, attacking hospitals, boming, humanity is die over gaza.
Got a v8 in that wheel chair 😂😂😂
You should get a small Velcro strap for the hind legs so that it does not get hit on the pavement
He's now confident and active. Love watching this dog. I know he is longing to run and play again with his buddy.
😇🙏🐶🐶🐶🐶😇🥰🐶🐶🐶
❤❤❤❤❤I am a pet mom of a paralysed Dashound. Amazing energy and love from him everyday. Is he able to relieve himself or so you press the bladder. 😢We are forced to relieve hos urine twice everyday.
I thought his bottom was just itching
God bless you sweet girl You are true human Many people actually abandon auch pets or get them killed You are a real darling taking care of him

He looks so cute, such a precious soul isnt bothered by what he doesnt have   If im being honest i thought he was scrathing his butt on the floor because he wanted to poop 😭
His happiness after he got wheels ❤
This makes my heart melt. My dog Loki passed 2/13/24 after complications from surgery to amputate his leg to stop cancer from spreading. I had a ramp for car and porch, a assistance harness already, and a wheelchair in my Amazon cart. I cry everyday, he would have been 8 on Thursday.  ❤😭💔
Todo lo que hsgsn para sentir bien a los animalitos que Jehová Dios bendiga sus nobles acciones y corazónes ❤❤❤❤
狗繩已經是變了另外一個用途😂😂😂😂

You show your dogs with so much love and affection, ❤❤

Here I’m thinking he has an itchy butt like most dogs. Do they just drag their butt around like that?
น้ำตาของคนรักสัตว์อย่างฉันกำลังจะไหล ขอบคุณคนที่มีเมตตาต่อเพื่อนร่วมโลกของเราค่ะ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉

You put a leash on the dog and just let him run free. Ha ha ha
🤘🏻💐🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
Kfofooo
You should really use their leashes. Ive seen to many dogs get smashed by cars. Idc how trained you think your dog is it sees another dog Across the street it is running to it and not checking for cars. Please be careful.
Спасибо вам за собачку и за помощь ей❤

He can’t contain the silliness.
Dogs are so beautiful and one of God's many gifts to us so cute.
The joy 😍
This is awesome, but do my eyes deceive me ..looks like wheels are so wobbly like they're gonna fall off😮
Oh my goodness, see how happy he is ❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
People like this shouldn't even be judged. It's straight to heaven for them🥹❤️
At first I was like, "He's not excited to go outside, he got worms!" But then I was like, "Okay, now I feel bad."
Years ago these pups would have been put down. I absolutely love seeing them happy and running free. Absolutely adorable.
❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂 gracias por compartir 💪💪💪💪🇨🇱

Please do something about that poor dogs back legs when you put him in the wheelchair. I  know he had no feeling In them but they’re dragging all over the footpath. 😢

❤❤ so happy to be able to run!!! 😊
Bellissimo
👏🫶👏🫶👏🫶
Cute, wonderful...but not taken at all with running free down the sidewalk. Of course, the dogs would NOT run into traffic or be distracted by other animals. Ummm.
That dog seems so happy but someone needs to fix his wheels
My Sparty was 16 when I bought his wheelchair. I prayed that it would give him another year and he lived  two. I attached a bicycle water bottle and a bowl. It gets hot in South Carolina and mid way on our walks I filled his bowl and the both of took a water break. We bought it from Doggon Wheels. After he died we donated it to the local Humane Society.
Avete un posto tra gli Dei ❤
😢до слез!!!❤
so sorry....
That’s beautiful ❤

❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😊👌👌👌
This is so cute😂, but maybe put a leash on them in the neighborhoods, they have dog parcjs for the free range stuff, ive seen way to many cases of upset neighbors shooting or harming other people dogs for "self defence" knowing full and well that the dog didnt do shit to them, just out of spite. Not to mention theres a road with cars, keep ur pups safe❤
Need to put some kind of covering on those back feet to protect them😮
This made me smile 😁 Love this 💕
Gracias sra. Por proporcionarle un carrito, donde se puede valer solo. Dios la Bendiga enormemente❤❤❤❤❤
anyone local please fab up a better rig with a sprung/ raised platform/ gaurded foot rest area for the lame leg & a more sturdy spring board style frame & harness fitting think elasticated baby bouncer come roman chariot that a design waiting for y'all who can do anything+everything i'm nr b'ham u.k & happy to make for the welfare of the animal if ever asked or come across circumstance.☆joedog☆

9. And some of the people said, This man careth for all creatures, are they his brothers and sisters that he should love them ? And he said unto them, Verily these are your fellow creatures of the great Household of God, yea, they are your brethren and sisters, having the same breath of life in the Eternal.     10. And whosoever careth for one of the least of these, and giveth it to eat and drink in its need, the same doeth it unto me, and whoso willingly suffereth one of these to be in want, and defendeth it not when evilly entreated, suffereth the evil as done unto me; for as ye have done in this life, so shall it be done unto you in the life to come.

Bless you for providing the dogs with a wonderful life❣️
I never understand why you should keep such a dog at home? it's a nightmare for him and the people. put him to sleep and that's it. this animal suffers every day because it sees that it is different and the stroller does not change anything. strange times
God bless
His bless you people
Doggies KNOW the route! Soooo excited. God bless you for taking care of a handicap dog-I know it’s not easy(experience)  As other dog grabs his leash and takes off running!
I'd put shoes on to protect the disabled feet.
🙏🙏🙏
Lindo esse gesto de cuidados com Eles JESUS CRISTO TE ABENÇOE SEMPRE AMÉM ❤
Крепкого здоровья, удачи и любви этим милым собачкам
Magnifique ❤

lindooooo
WHAT A LOVELY FAMILY! GOD BLESSED!
Какие вы молодцы! 🙏🙏🙏
I don't care how well trained you think your dog is, it is never ok to let them run off leash on a busy road. I've seen far too many well "trained" dogs with devastating injuries or dead after their human thought they'd never run into the road because they were trained.
Freedom!!!! ❤love this
Tack så mycket.
Very happy but coild be dangerous letting her run without a leash on. She could run into the road
Le zampe posteriori non devono toccare il terreno e o l'asfalto!
Merci pour lui c'est magnifique il est heureux ce chien cela ce voit tellement ! Attention a l'accident tout de meme avec les roue qui ne s'arrête pas seule mais je pense que vous le savez deja 😢🎉😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤ lovely baby
💯Beautiful thanks for sharing ❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Lo lindo que he visto hoy ❤❤❤
Aww To so much fit the care and love first the fuzzy babies
Sooo cool, well done people!!😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏
Then both blow off the recall and goes out in the road. Cuz we know a person who dont respect other people and dont ask their dogs to stay with them do not have a recall.
so cute

Ew.  I hope you shampoo that rug frequently

I would hate for my dog to have to adjust to that

Take him to the chiropractor. There's probably a 50-50 chance that it could be cured instantly

It is heart breaking to see disabled/handicapped/paralyzed animals, even if they are happy.Please search for vets that/who have healed disabled/handicapped/paralyzed animals, then when they are (finally) back to normal post a video of them.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

so.sweet ❤
Does she want two disabled dogs? Letting them run around on their own without a leash is bound to end up in an accident one day. Even if you think you're in full control of your dog, you have no idea what other people and animals will do.
The happiness they express is the cutest.
❤❤❤❤❤
D beste
❤❤❤❤
👍💯❤️❤️❤️🙏
Bless them! Beautiful family.
I have a pain with love in my heart. I have  no words  to  explain my feelings. the disabled pet  is  soooo  lucky.  the person , who is taking care of the pet ,  is  a person with a bigger heart .  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Meanwhile china people eating this poor creature
Я говорю это как мусульманин. потому что я родился на мусульманской земле. но я думаю, что эти люди больше заслуживают рая. AMI.
Ela devia de pôr no carrinho uma trave para as patas traseiras não arrastem pelo chão fora aquilo deve de magoar o animal

I had a mini daushound who was born deformed and not able to walk so I bought the smallest doggy wheel chair on the internet and with some adjustments gave her the ability to run and walk. She lived to 13yrs old and I miss her every day. Loved that little girl.

Grazie a questa mamma umana per l'assistenza a questo meraviglioso bimbo!!!! Grazie anche a chi ha inventato questo aiuto per l'animale in difficoltà fisica. Inoltre il terzo ed immenso grazie per l'amore di questa ragazza per i suoi cagnolini, abbondantemente ripagato dalla felicità e dalla gioia che gli esprimono.!!!!❤❤❤
I have rescued dog that was almost dead when I got her today at 14 she is totally blind but is just as full of life as this dog all they need is love
❤wow I take long breath in.
The excitement shows the animals are created for outside not for staying in living room...
Thats wrong to send them loose without having them on leashes...wierd
Merece respeito.

I had a weenier dog that broke his back and we got him a custom wheel chair and after about 3 months he didn’t need it anymore he just started walking normal again and lived for like 5 more years.
Just a reminder to put a leash on your dogs. No matter how friendly they are towards other humans or animals.  If another guy has a dog which isn't that friendly towards other dogs and if those two get near, that could end up in a bad situation.  Remember, leashes arent meant to be a tool for emprisionment, just a tool to help protect your dogs and others.
У вас огромное сердце❤, спасибо, спасибо огромное за вашу заботу и любовь к нашим братьям меньшим, здоровья вам и вашим питомцам.🙏
GOD BLESS THEM BOTH FROM LUZ DEL CARMEN RUIZ FROM MODESTO CALIFORNIA 💯💯💯
Such excitement; such joy; such happiness; makes me love animals the more. ❤❤😽🐒
Initially i thought he has itching in the ass😂
E sii felice con l'altro amico cane ❤

One thing is for sure here in N.Y.C. people here don't allow stray dogs or sick dogs to fend for themselves like back in the 70s and 80s.

This video is so touching. The dogs both looked so happy. I'm taking my dog for a long walk tomorrow. Next time I adopt a dog I will keep a disabled dog in mind. Thank you!

I want to say .. awesome personn.. 😍
😂😂🎉
❤❤❤super sister ❤❤❤
신나게 달리며 행복해하는 표정~ 진짜 최고네요!!
Wouldn't that be dangerous? Take him to some park instead of open sidewalk with busy road. Those wheels doesn't have a break mechanism I guess
People use disabled animals as an example of why we should allow disabled humans to be euthanized. Does this dog look unhappy? Do you think that if he was told to believe he was useless then he would feel unhappy? Yes that is what happens when you are told You are no value or worth  A disabled person who fights hard every day to walk and to not take the euthanized pill which my insurance company wishes I would.
❤❤❤
El momeno de la felicidad. ❤
Pobrecita 😢 mí vida !!.. Gracias por atenderla ❤
А пёсик видимо знает, что с этой колясочкой он пойдет гулять. И очень радуется!
Good thing the car wasn't backing out since no leash was on the dog, that street looks busy to allow no leash

You should put him some boots on the back paws so they don’t scrape against the concrete 🗿

Трудовые, повседневные, героичнские будни. Но сколько счастья у хозяйки и у собак.Это дорогого стоит.  ❤  ❤  ❤ .

Remember, a dog's life is so short in comparison to ours.   It's the least we can do, to care for an injured,  disabled,  aged,  homeless dog.
Such love is beautiful.

사람 주인이 개에게 관대한 처사를 보여준것을 보며 인생에게 관대하신 신을 생각하지 못하는것을 안타까움이라  말합니다. 신은  주체성을 가진 사람에게 신의 아들 예수님으로 죄에 문제를 해결해 주셧고 우리는 죄에게 놓여 자유로운 영이신 예수님으로 영원한소망을 갖게 됏읍니다. 신은 가장 가치잇는 일을  하셧다는것에 영광ㆍ감동이 잇읍니다🎉

❤❤❤❤❤❤.정말보는내내.행복해보입니다.
And I know so many cases when Humans just give up and put the dog down 😢 This is so precious. Great proof we shall never give up on them
Cute, but put them on a leash. No good reason not to. It's not just about their safety, but the safety of others.
Oh,so wunderbar, der Hund hat richtig Freude obwohl er diese Behinderung hat. Schön..❤👍❤️
So precious. Also i don't know if you considered this but i would recommend some kind of protection for the back feet. Like a shoe or something, since they are sliding on the ground quite a lot it seems. But maybe you have your reason. I just know from personal experience with one of my dogs it can be very important.
You made that animal happy, surely God will make your heart happy💯❤️
❤❤❤😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️
🌷 👍 😘💕
Thank u mom❤❤❤
Sehr schön das Sie Ihren Hund das Leben erleichern! 💪💪❤❤ Allerdings sollten Sie Ihre Hunde an der Straße und im Wohngebiet an die Leine nehmen. 🙏🏽🙏🏽 Es ist sehr gefährlich für andere Passanten ,wenn die Hunde voller Freude los stürmen.🤷
Какая счастливая!)
That's a happy and good boy ❤😊😊
Que alegria que ele fica podendo correr, Deus abençoe  vc que fez issi se tornar realidade

Thank you mam for giving these dogs a good life. It's a shame st the amount of dogs that get put down simply because of a disability. They are human beings best friend. I'd save my dog over any human being atleast she has been loyal to me unlike my drug addiction friends
Awesome vid! I hope his name is Wheels.😎 Thanks for taking care of him! Amazing job with all that love!

Bet the carpet smells nice.
My heart is so happy for this pup.
Sweet baby!
みんな、楽しんで!!　(・∀・)💘
❤thank you
Er ist so glücklich, ès gibt eine Seite im Internet da gibt es einen gnadenlhof mit ganz vielen rollyhunden! Einfach mal eingeben, hunde in allen Größen! Habe ich mal zufällig gesehen, tolle Menschen tolle Tiere ❤
İnsanların ne ırkı ne dini ne dili beni asla ilgilendirmiyor. İnsanı insan yapan tek şey merhamettir.
Whoever made those wheelchairs for dogs  God bless you... This gives them a way of life.... Just amazing and wholesone to watch...Beautiful
So kind of you...Hatsoff...Gods blessings always to ur family
What a wonderful person you are to love your dog so much you gave him wheels.  My sweet dad did that for his dachshund…made a little wooden platform with skateboard wheels  low level and rested his dog’s rump and hind legs on it, strapped to his little chest harness so he could get around….not as lively has your beautiful dog, but happy to be included in my Dad’s senior life even though he couldn’t walk anymore.  Just Like you, my father had a giant heart full of love to share.
This just warms my heart.... Well else has watched this like 50 times
❤️
I thought he was wiping his butt at first 😂
🫰🫰🥰😘🥰😘
Taking care of pets is good. You have rightly helped. Thank you.

Que Dios los bendiga,como sería el mundo con personas Como ustedes,una lección de amor felicidades por esa sonrisa a la vida.

Very cute and wonderful. Just don’t let your dogs run near traffic off leash even if they’re well trained. Working in an animal hospital I’ve seen too many tragic circumstances. It happens fast in a second. Otherwise very caring and lovely.
好感動

А в России готовят закон об уничтожении бродячих животных...
God bless you ma'am 😊🙏🙌🙌🙌🙌
Why doesn't this owner walk her dog with a leash? If she did that, she wouldn't be able to protect the dog from the car society.
Please FIX the wheel!!..
hay una patica q se golpea contra el piso
Che invenzione stupenda... La felicità ❤
I'm so sorry when i saw the very beginning, I thought the butt dragging on the floor was like what my dog does. It definitely is not, and I'm glad i watched the whole thing cause it's adorable!
😂👍🏻💯
Золотая женщина ❤
That's it sweetheart don't care what people think 👊
Спасибо Вам огромное ❤❤❤❤❤
How adorable! ❤
You need to protect the back legs from dragging along the ground.
My 8 year old Dachshund was just diagnosed with ivdd 6 days ago. She has lost the ability to move her back legs as well as bowel control. She is on strict kennel rest for the next 3 weeks. Luckily she is a trooper and is taking it very well, I can see the urge to get up and run in her eyes and her excitement every time I let my gsd outside without her is quickly followed by sad puppy eyes when she realizes she can't go out with him. I pray she will heal, but if that doesn't happen I just hope she will be pain free so we can get her a wheelchair and get her mobile again. 🤞🤞🤞
💖💖
😢😢
Que maravilla dios los bendiga ❤😮😅
Thank you for loving so much!
NOW TRY AND TAKE CARE OF A HANDICAPPED CHILD, SOMETHING REAL
Después de ver tanta irresponsabilidad de sacarlos sin correa , ya sabemos porque el perro está inválido
God bless you mam for loving this adorable dog
It's okay yes like on roulette rather  😂😂😂  A Dog on Wheels Now
Que felicidad!!
Побольше бы таких людей❤ Дай боже! Вам здоровья за вашу доброту
😢❤😢
Personas buenas que aman y consideran los animalitos, el perrito está feliz
My roomate gets angry with me about how happy i sound whatching this video.
I got tears Hats off to you for this God bless you all
Wow, that dog could care less if his back legs work or not. He has her loveable owner, cool wheel chair and a beautiful day waiting to be explored, what else do you need 😇
Que Felicidad , se ve en su comportamiento, gracias por tu generosidad. 😊😊
❤
❤😊
I was just wondering would that not hurt his back feet if it gets dragged? Maybe the harness should be lifted a little bit higher.
Magnifique ❤

Dios le bendiga abundantemente por amar tanto a éstos angelitos.
Pero también atendí al mismo tiempo a mi papá 17 con media parálisis, Hola vida me quería decir algo o yo no que hice pero siempre lo hice con mucho amor ❤❤❤❤❤
Dios te bendiga, y te multiplique la ayuda que le brindas, a esos perritos. ❤❤
That would be my dream job, build little wheelchairs for disabled doggy's .. 😢
😢😢😢😢😢 qué hermoso yo tuve una perrita así 2 años y en total me duró 18

Top sweet, joyful happy pooches...  :-)
Que feliz esta al poder correr libre como si nada, esa es la clase de milagros q si merecen la pena. Uno se imagina q no pueda andar y tenga q estar en casa limitada y de pronto alguien crea una silla q te ayuda a caminar como siempre casi y saborear la independencia de  correr sola   es lo mas grande , pues lo mismo le ocurrio al pobre perrito.❤🐕🦮
Wow that's fast
정말 대단하셔요^^
This got me to tears. These dogs an incredible mommy!!!

Santo Cristo corre mejor que yo dios lo cuide y a sus padres que lo aman tanto, ❤

❤Ça fait super plaisir à voir!!
😊😊😊❤❤❤😂
Gonna have to set a "speed limit" for that little dude! 😂
I thiught he was trying to get rid of a worm.
How can you not love that
This is bitter sweet for me. Years ago our GSD x Collie needed one of these, but we couldn't afford one, so we had to have her life taken from her. I've never felt so guilty about anything in my life and I'll never get over it. I loved my Sammy so much. 😭 ❤️

You lucky this aint on instagram
God bless you madame 😊😊😊❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Its beatifull
Super madam
Que carita de felicidad 💖
He still moves better than I do, before he even gets in the wheel chair.😂
This really can teach a lot of humans how to live life and enjoy whatever state you're in
So happy indeed Thankyou ❤❤❤❤❤
Putting a leash on your dog then letting him run down the street?
🥰❤❤❤❤
❤
Omg what a cutie pie! He literally handi jumped off the steps and is a speedy dude whoa love it!
Need to tighten the boy's wills up there wobbling.
A dog is not leashed simply because it has a leash in its mouth.  One end has to be attached to the dog's collar/harness. The other end has to be attached to the human.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂 video bellissimo
Poor sweet baby!! ❤
Sweet babies!
So happy ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

That's so great but man it makes me so nervous u don't have him them on a leash that othe dog was flying 😢 accidents happen in a split second....😞
God bless him..
This is the type of content I LOVE!!  I can’t get enough of this.
Jo that dog got worms. U certainly wanna check that out
Look at those angels 😍😍😇😇
La natura avvolte è crudele sia con gli animali che con le persone , guardando questo video mi commuovo dalla felicita' che l'animale esprime sia prima che dopo quando corre spensierato insieme al suo amico , sensa disriminazione gioioso e felice .
Ноги задние подвязать надо и на подушку,су ма сойти дамы
Бедняга😢❤
Meraviglioso!
❤🐕♥️
Es gratificante ver la alegría que demuestran!!! Siempre ven lo que nunca nosotros vamos a poder"
❤🥲🐶❤
Lindoooooooo🦮👸
Poor dog is so happy
Anal gland needs to be expressed
❤❤❤❤❤🏃🏃🏃
Cute but no leash is illegal and this isn't being responsible. They could get hit by a car
Que hermoso verlo disfrutar, correr, me hizo llorar. Gracias por compartir y Dios te bendiga por amarlo, cuidarlo, protegerlo y hacer más fácil su vida.
Çok güzeller❤❤❤🎉🎉

❤❤❤❤❤❤🐕🐕🐕🐕🙏🙏🙏🙏
Sweet poochie!
Made my heart smile, what a wonderful positive sight
It is lovely to see a dog so happy!
💝💕🙏✌️👌❣️❣️💞💞❤️❤️‍🩹🥂🍾
Awe
Lindo demais 😊
Help me, lord! I thought the dog was wiping his butt on the carpet...on purpose. 🤦🏾‍♀️
🥰🥰🥰🥰
I just came back home after walking my dog , i showed him this and believe it or not people ! he got excited and went up on his back little feet and started making a very specific sound i call the happy giggle.. i have a German spitz and he’s familiar with disabled dogs so i think he’s happy for this cute baby enjoying his wheels ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think it is wonderfully that the disabled dog has a harness/wheel Mobility however I am VERY CONCERNED that they were BOTH ALLOWED TO GO FOR THEIR RUN TOTALLY UNACCOMPANIED AND SUPERVISED BY A HUMAN AND ALSO THE WHEELS LOOKED EXTREMELY UNSAFE!!! The lead dog has a leash but what security does that give either one of them running on the side of the road on the sidewalk without supervision...I was in such fear for their safety...can u explain this?  I hope I am wrong!!!🤔😲
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I'll admit, the first few seconds of seeing this video, I thought the dog had worms. lol
Que feliz me hace ,verle tan feliz,🐕🐕❤🎊🎉🙌🐶
Bravissima. Questo è amare gli animali ❤❤❤❤❤
Emocionada! Ele corre tão feliz 😅
💖❤️💕♥️💞💓💖
А ведь ещё лет 20 назад,  этих бедолашек усыпляли 😔

😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤
Give the kid(dog) ester-c it should help . Check with a vet if you have concerns, they use it on german shepherds. I used it on my weiner dog who was in same shape as yours and he walked until his passing. Dry 1000 mg
Peu importe le nombre de pattes ou de roues tant que le cœur bat
👏

I wonder if the back legs could go into a device like an elliptical and if that would help get the nerves and blood flowing to regain some function? Anyway, thank you for loving this doggo!
Brilliant..your a really good person 👌👍❤✨✨✨🙏🦘
So cute this dog
❤❤❤❤❤
Medame muita  pena más parece que es feliz 😢😊🐶❤️♥️

Sweet dog, beautiful owners
Yaaa necədə həycınlı sevinçildi 😊
❤Amorevolmente stupendo❤
That's precious and sad
Debe subirle las patitas, la mía se raspaba, le puse unas tiritas y ahí le metía los piecitos.❤
I am really happy to see people care about pets, and I appreciate those owners. But please do wheels alignment.
SHOOOO....CUTE AND SWEET!!!
What? I don’t get it. What’s the point of that leash if it’s not even on and held. You can’t let your dogs run free on the streets.
Too wonderful and sweet that dog was so excited to run❤❤
😢😢❤
Aw, them running down the sidewalk is so cute.  God bless you and your babies.
❤
I'm crying and this moment so happy that's dog❤
P such a beautiful dog and so happy you made him
Чудо-собаки!!! Чудо-хозяйка!!!❤❤❤
The excitement ❤🎉❤😊😊😊😊, makes my heart sing😊😊😊
Those 2 dogs are beautiful!
عزیزم چقدر خوشحال شد لذت حرکت کردن در خیابان تجربه کرد.😂🎉
I see the leashes are just for decoration...
Her floors are covered with poop particles for sure.
So cute 🥰💕
This is the best thing I've seen on YouTube in the last month. You're a great person who deserves great things. Dogs are better then people.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wish these had been around years ago for my dog. Had to put her to sleep.
행복해라 아가들아❤❤❤❤❤
I'm so sorry for my first thought, God bless you guys
Só em Ver a Felicidade do Cachorro Com O seu Amigo Me Deixou  Muito Feliz Tratem Bem DELE ele Merece🙏🙏🙏👌👌👌✌️✌️✌️👍👍👍🤗🤗🤗🇵🇹

Son unos Amores😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Какая прелесть 👏👏👏❤❤❤😊🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
😍😍😍😍😍😍
😱  Leash them mfkn dogs! If I would've saw those dogs running full speed in my direction I would've freaked TF out. Unleash them at a dam dog park NOT the dam sidewalk 🤦🏾‍♀️. A lot of dog owners are so inconsiderate.
😢😢❤❤
❤❤❤😂😂😂❤❤❤
Povero amore, non poteva camminare............per fortuna e' aiutato da un altro cane amico. Bravo, fra voi ci si aiuta. ❤
Esmira😊😊yhguhguhh
God bless you people with all the happiness of life 🌹
God Bless you Cute baby.
Dog go vroom
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Meraviglioso!!! Grazie!!
Leash laws exist for a reason its not cute to ignore them for a video. Leash ur damm dogs
Instead of keeping your dog on a leash you let it run near the street while holding the leash. I wonder how the other dog has two paralyzed back legs🤔 Dogs running freely near a busy road is perfectly safe, just ask the golden colored dog named gimpy.
So cute❤. God bless you.
)))
Cute ❤
❤❤❤
❤❤❤😭🙏🏻
❤❤❤
🥰👏🥰👏🥰👏🥰👏🌹🌹🌹
Dog is soon cute God bless
КАКОЕ. СЧАСТЬЯ. ЧТО. ОНА. ЕСТЬ. РЯДОМ. СПАСИБО. ВАМ.
❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
ماشاء الله
awe!!!
BLESS YOU!!! WHAT A GIFT YOU ARE TO THAT SWEET POOCHIE!!!
Humans should be leashed not dogs
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
В этом и состоит счастье
I love seeing this…people taking care of their dogs even on very hard conditions like this. ❤ life will reward you immensely
❤
❤❤❤
The amazing thing is hiw he runs without hitting anything or even running off the edge of the sidewalk.
I ❤it!!!
That almost made me cry!!!! The excitement and joy! Made me really happy
That left wheel scares me.
😍😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You must be one hell of a human being!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Please maintain your dog's in a public area not just for the safety of others but for your dogs and yourself.
Малыш 🤗🤗🤗❤
Maybe put some boots on the back feet of the wheelchair dog
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
You are an angel, For looking after that beautiful dog

Always hold your dogs leash, even in your neighborhood. You might have the best dog ever, but that other one across the street might not be so chill.
So damn amazing. ❤️🥰
dang there are some people that are just...idk...they care about lives outside of their own species. Its beautiful....Most people I have met would put their companion down for almost anything that they find an inconvenience to their life. Im so happy and grateful for the humans that are different. You bring light into my world!

Vous m'avez mis les larmes de dingue alors quil faudrais pas justement je suis super content pour le chien comme le chien est content peace ✌🏾👍🏾🙏🏾✌🏾👍🏾🙏🏾✌🏾👍🏾🙏🏾✌🏾👍🏾 bravo a celui qui a inventer cette super chose
Beautiful babies. His legs drag on the floor. Maybe they can adjust them, so they do not scratch them.
Два вертолётика понеслись 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💖💖💖
His back legs are hitting the floor and going close to the back wheels.  Tie his legs up a little.
No words😘🫢
Look how happy she is and can run

На Силикате в Подмосковье тоже видела лайку на задних колесах. Хозяевам большой респект. Это же наши дети.
Cuídelos por favor en la calle 🙏
All I can think every time I see this type of video is that dogs are so lucky they were mostly born loyal and tolerant of human shenanigans, because my immediate next mental picture is trying to get any cat I've ever had into a wheelchair and failing long before the cat ever finds out it can move more freely with it
OMG how absolutely incredible.  This doggy is so happy to be able to run outside and it shows. Ohhh so beautiful ❤️❤️
Awesome ❤love happy babies!
❣️❣️🥹
I thought it had worms at the start.
❤❤❤❤
So sad 😢
❤❤❤❤
You are doing great. God bless you and pets
😍
Go for it!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Animals really appreciate the time that they are with their human Is too bad other human's don't appreciate the same ANIMALS  RULE.
This is how mum trims my nails 😂
God bless you ❤❤❤
Спасибо вам милый человек за вашу доброту!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Letting dogs run off leash next to a street is so stupid
He's amazing, such a shame for the owner's rugs though
😢

Him having the little zoomies is the cutest thing ever. I'd say he is ecstatic about being able to run and play. That little face tells it all.
u r god dear
I didn't realise this dog was disabled at first I just thought it was a dog doing that rubbing it's ass along the carpet.........
Bless her heart❤❤❤❤❤

Jai kaal bhairav 🙏🙏🙏
The dog that has the spots he or she reminds me of my dog cookie
💪💪💪👍👍👍
What a good mama
Is there a sling to keep the toes off the ground? It looks like they are dragging the tops of their feet which isn't good.
Здоровья тебе собачечка! Я тебя люблю ❤

Superlindos estos peludos
As much as I love both dogs, I really wish its owner would leash them. Having them like this could cause trouble for big boys like mine and it is terrifying to think what someone else’s carelessness could cause.

What a wonderfully happy fella...❤️
Que bello ❤😢
They must keep you so entertained. One holding his own leash and the other so excited, seemingly unaware he is disabled.
That’s cute and all but why the heck aren’t they on leashes that you are holding. If I’m walking my dog on his leash down the street and your off leash dog runs up on him it is NOT ok. Disabled or not idc. YOU have to have control of your dogs. BOTH of them
Thiscis the best dog video ive seen.  He is so happy. May he lead a long happy life.
It might help to stiffen up the frame so the wheels don't wobble so much.
What lovely people, giving that dog a happy life. God bless
Then they both get hit by some one backing up
Как она радуется😘😃😉Ваша собачка🥰Бежит сама,как летит😂👍👍👍 Саратов ♥️
Bro ain’t crippled he just like wiping his ass on everything

چرا ما انسانها به سگها احترام میگذا یم ولی گوسفندان مظلوم را میکشیم . گاوها را میکشیم ماهی هارا به بدترین شکل میکشیم  ومرگ آنها مارا افسرده نمیکند

Excuse you. No matter what all pets must have a leash in public, unless it’s a private property.
Je trouve ça  vraiment génial cette invention. Et on vois vraiment le bonheur que le chien a en courant ❤❤
Muito lindos! Nao os deixe sem a guia. Eu sei que eles não são agressivos, mas pode ocorrer incidente, um barulho mais forte e eles se assustarem e correr para a estrada. Deus abencoe vocês  vida longa para os seus amiguinhos!❤
So beautiful May God bless them 🙏
❤
Can the back legs be picked up as not drag on the ground? Looks like it can hurt. Thank you for your loving heart.
He's got worms
Your an Amazing woman giving them both a safe& loving home. God bless you Always & those Precious dogs you have. One with the wheels, is Amazing. Both Precious

Happy dog he's ready to do a wheelie down the road🐕🐕🐶🐶🐶
Bros ass is never itchy
А задние лапки не сотрёт об асфальт?
❤❤❤❤❤
Que lindo parabéns pelo trabalho
This is a very sweet video but that clearly isn’t private property and they should be on leash. I didn’t notice any comments about this and I don’t want people to see this sweet video and think so long as their dogs are friendly, they can be off leash. That isn’t the case! If someone has a friendly dog off leash and it charges my on leash, reactive dog, something bad could happen. Very sweet video, you are giving your dogs a great life it seems! But please keep them on leash!
Lovely!!!
Ne kadar güzel bir insansınız, Tanrı sizi korusun.
Too sweet..
❤❤❤😊
Just so happy to run too,.so beautiful..
Its so heart warming ! ❤
AINT NO STOPPING ME NOW
Maybe wrap his/her feet because of dragging
Oh der arme 🐕❤
Brought a tear to my eye, that dog looks so happy ❤

❤ I was having a rough day but after watching this video it made me realize that even though the dog has disabilities, dog still overcomes and enjoying life, thanks for taking the blues 💙 away

Que hermosura de angelito 😍

Bhagwan apko swarg de
The paws are dragging on the pavement 😮
Aren’t there leash laws on your city? Why would you think it’s ok to just let them run free? Are you psychic? Do you know what’s ahead up the road? Very irresponsible. I’m happy your dog has wheels to get around. But, to just allow them run free does not make you a good dog owner. I live across the street from a park and it’s a violation here to let dogs run unleashed and in the owner’s control. Last week I noticed one dog run across the street after a squirrel. It didn’t stop and look both ways. The owner came running, while I stopped cars, to control his dog. And if you love your other dog, get a harness instead of a collar. Read up on tracheal damage due to collars. Ask your vet.
My heart! ❤
❤❤
Tadinho ele gosta de passear Deus abençoe a tutora e os cachos 🙏
Am I the only one concerned about the booty scoots on the carpet? Very cute doggies though. 💕

What a kind soul the owner and the dog have. Bless them all.
Peludito hermoso que feliz se pone al salir, gracias buena persona gran ❤
I'm all for the dog being provided the specialized wheelchair, so it can run and play. However it's disabled status does not grant it special rights to be off-leash. It could easily knock down a toddler and injure the child before the owner could reach the dog and restrain it. That's precisely why we have leash laws for all animals in public spaces. Fix this immediately so your dog doesn't injure someone or worse, and so your pet doesn't run into the street and be crushed to death by a motor vehicle.  As someone who is totally disabled, I have a clear understanding of why all disabled persons must abide by the laws and not try to  openly violate multiple laws every time we go somewhere. Driving a vehicle of any kind is an inherently dangerous activity for the driver, the passengers, as well as everyone on the road, crossing the road, walking beside the road either on the shoulder or a sidewalk. Disabled humans beings must therefore be extra vigilant when we are driving any kind of vehicle.   There are no laws regarding operating a motor vehicle, which only apply to disabled people or that apply only to those who are fully-abled.  Please be courteous and always ensure that your pets are always in compliance with all laws no matter where you are outside of your own property boundaries and also be hyper vigilant while operating any type of motor vehicle [including scooters, e bikes, e motorcycles, etc],so as to be doing everything in your power to prevent accidents as much as possible.  Thank you!

Oh poor doggie, I thought he had a bad case of worms lol. But it would be funny if he really did have worms and has never needed that cart, just a course of deworming tablets😂
Beautiful 😊❤
God bless you for taking care of him or she love you so much ❤
Where can I get that for my chihuahua puppy and my other grandmother’s chihuahua because they are both also paralyzed
❤❤❤❤😂😊
Please tighten that wheel!! I cant imagine it being good if that wobbly wheel falls off at full speed.
❤️

True Happiness. Prayers for better attention to a unforseen accident. A vehicle may not see your fur baby blissfully running down the sidewalk.🙏🏼

C'est merveilleux qu'il puisse courir comme ça grâce a cette aide roulotte 🥰💕
God bless you for those wheel-legs,for valuing his need to run outdoors.Having rescued & raised strays,and having one sweet older dog that had a sudden neurological attack when both his hind legs were just like this,for 10 days, even after injections,IV etc.I cried when he went to pee outdoors on his wobbly legs...he recovered fully. I am SO proud of you for taking care of this sweetie.
খুব খুব ভালো মানুষ তোমরা -- তোমাদের মত মানুষের আজ বেশী প্রয়োজন এই পৃথিবীর। তোমাদের জন্য আবার মা পৃথিবীর প্রাণী জগৎ,উদ্ভীদ জগৎ নতুন করে বাচবে । জয় মা বনদেবী ,তোমরা খুব খুব ভালো থেকো ।

Rather dangerous with leash collars and wheelchair yet still roaming free could run in the street or run others walking on the sidewalk over or scare them accidentally.
Que felicidad tremenda Dios los bendiga con muchísimos años de amor mutuo e incondicional. ❤

Que bendición tiene con uds. Dios los bendiga siempre ❤ un abrazo fuerte desde Guadalajara Jalisco México
No leash law there?
What a good boy and tanks for helping them
YOU SHOULDN'T LET YOUR DOGS LEASH DRAG BEHIND HIM LIKE YOU DID.   IT'S VERY DANGEROUS IN MORE WAYS THAN YOU KNOW, SO HOLD  ON TO THE DOGS LEASH. THAT IS WHAT THE HANDLE IS FOR.
❤
Бедная собака, но счастье так и прёт
Com'è felice di correre col suo carrellino insieme al suo amico
❤❤
May I ask the purpose for of the leash?
C'est vraiment super.  Je suis en train de chercher un système analogue pour mon vieux Beauceron. Les pattes arrières sont démusculées du fait de l'âge, mais l'envie est toujours présente dans ses yeux... Les chiens ont plein de vie et d'amour à donner ! Il faut VRAIMENT  les respecter et les aimer !
Это какое-то чудо. Дай БОГ вам всего, всего❤❤❤
He's a meat crayon

Побежали гулять радостные счастливые. Пусть хозяевам воздастся за их доброту  сердечность и любовь к этим божьим созданиям ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

These are so wonderful! I used to work in a vet clinic, they b were extremely humane, but were at the forefront of animal medicine. Doggie and kitty chemo ( you'd be surprised to learn how much a person's wiling to spend b on a pets me s ical care. I guess unconditional love has a high-priced tag, but any anountbisvworth it since unconditional love is truly a priceless act almost al pets are good for. ..to find b it in a human, as  rare as a walk with christ

😍😍😍😍
As someone who uses a wheelchair themself, i know the joy that little puppy has to once again be able to at least almost get to to do something you love again. I love watching that joy
*@abc7NY* 🗽                  That dog no doubt has the *CLEANEST* and most *ITCH-LESS* butt a dog can have. 😎🫴
Хорошо,только надо правую заднюю в какую-то петельку ставить, чтобы по земле не волочилась.
I rememder the store of a park ranger or anmimal resq. Person who love to hang gild ? Spelling.  He was taking care of an Eagle that had lost a wing a few years. And came across a guy who would take his small dog hang gilding with him.  He had a harness made for the Eagle and said how the Eagle who he had been working with for a few years.  Look at him so diffance after the first flight. Giving the dog the freedom to run with the wind.  Like giving the eagle back its wings to fly  Just amazing
“I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself.” - D.H. Lawrence.  Apropos for this dog as well.

It's amazing the resiliency of animals. I love that you don't treat him like a disabled dog. And he appreciates that so much, which is why he can be normal, feel loved, and happy. Awesome job mom!
This is so sweet.  Her wheelchair is so colorful. The other dog is good physical therapy for the wheelchair dog trying to keep up.  This makes me think anything is possible with disabled animals.  People dont realize what it takes to care for animals like this.  Both these dogs are blessed with loving people that care about our furry friends.   Thank you for caring. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The kids r awesome bless them an mom

Dear instagram algorithm Gods - THIS! 20 bagillion more times this! Not some “influencer” who has spent their entire day on their hair & makeup (followed by photoshopping). MORE OF THIS!

That makes me smile.  😊
Que tierno  los amó
Precious! Thank you for loving him even if he is not perfect and you have more work around him than a healthy dog… ❤❤❤
Brilliant. The chair however needs a strap to keep his hind legs from dangling and in place. That should be easy to add. Get a velcro, strap it around his legs and the frame. He would love it. Thank you guys for all you do.
Very sad to see this dog's condition
Бешеные кони😂
God bless you❤❤❤❤❤

Just love this. First,  thank God He brought you into this pup's life.  Second,  baby went flying off that step,  and can run like the wind!  Love this!!
If you put something to protect the back legs and that way he or she is not going to be dragging them?

The pure joy and anticipation on that babies face says it all! Sweetest thing I’ve seen all day!
My dog is so loved by me and I would do this for him too . This is such a game changer for the disabled dogs we love ❤
Bravo
❤❤❤❤AAAAAAWH XXX SOOOO HAPPY 😊 X
I honestly see vids like this, or other happy dog vids, or even the sad ones full of past memories, and it makes me love my Pup more n More. I just believe  they are better than us because  despite  how horrible  they have been treated, they only want to give companionship  and unconditional  love. They aim to please and are just better than us all around imo. Cats... diff story altogether. And another distinction outdoor crappin n livin vs indoor crappin cats... big distinction. Cats that we allow to crap "inside" lose all respect for humans and treat them like peasants. It's just in my experience  that this has been the case.
Merci
Omg!  I love this!❤
Que hermoso Le gana a rayo mcquien y al spede gonzalez😂
Oh that mussing on the head along with the excite OK GO!! Amazing...Im tearing up😢😊😊
❤
Es innegable... este peludito es absolutamente feliz 😄 😁 💛 💕 😊 💜 da gusto verle como disfruta con su silla ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Aww so sweet that’s cute she jumped the step like that
🙏❤️🇵🇹
🪂🧸💙
Okay 😢😢
❤
That is so cool!! Umm but would it be more comfortable if your dog has a sling to support his hind legs instead of it hanging loose in the back?   Sorry for the questions.
That puppy is so happy to go outside.  Love it.
Go boy
❤❤❤
😘🐶😔🙏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🇲🇽
He needs some sort of sock so his two back feet doesn't get road rash.
🤍🤍🤍🤍🙏🏻

EXCELLENT ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is so adorable...altho to be fair at first i thought they were just ruining the rug lol
This is just too precious  ❤❤❤❤
Just bc your dogs cripple doesnt mean you own the sidewalk. Keep your dogs on a leash
근데 뒷 다리가 땅에 안끌리게 조치를 취해 주셔야겠네요
My heart is now few degrees warmer ❤😊

Now that's a quality life!
didn't read the title so I was half laughing at the dog for doing such a funny walk at the beginning ... :/ but the pure joy of this dog makes me feel less bad about it glad those dogs have such a good owner
Put that thing out to pasture ffs
❤
Most dogs like to go outside. That dog just wants the wheels on.
Happy dog. No leash laws there? Your dog is going to be a road pizza.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This dog needs its glands cleaned and you need to clean your house
I applaud you!! I too had a wheelchair dog. People would look so sad about her being in a chair, until they saw her run! She had DM, such a terrible thing, so i made her last year the best i could. Love to you all!
Oh mein Gott wie rührend !!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Повезло собаке, с такой хорошей хозяйкой!!!
La sua felicità quando sfreccia veloce, riempie il cuore, ha un sorriso spettacolare. Complimenti ❤

You need to brace his back feet so they don't get bruised from the sidewalk.  You can see them being dragged.  But it is so cute to see him all excited.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow qué alegría de vivir tiene este agradecido perrito lo amé!!!❤😊

Could hold the other ones leash but I guess it doesn’t really matter there’s just no point in even giving the leash to it anyways
I just love watching this❤🙏!
Muy hermoso gracias
Merveille di monde❤❤
Es un estilo de vida de  vida que todos de alguna manera pudieramos interactuar si tuvieramos donde acogerlos, pero me lleno de emocio'n y admiracio'n por las personas que los acogen y los aman de verdad no es sencillo pero el amor lo supera y hace sencillo a  la vista  Dios bendiga a ambas partes por que contagian de emocio'n
Que contento  se pone  al poder correr  el  pobrecito, son felices con  poco
Soooo the leash is just for looks or.... pet peeve of mine (pun intended). Leash your pets. It's just safer for everybody, including them.
❤❤❤❤❤😅😅😅
For your love ... god will bess you ....... He is so happy ........

❤❤❤ so sweet
I can't give this enough 👍💖
❤❤❤❤❤❤
It brought a tear to my eye when I saw the pup running full speed with the wheels. 🥲 Running is so important to dogs and it's amazing that the good boy can do it with the help of humans. We have the ability to help and it is our duty to help those who can't help themselves. ❤
Lovely 🥰 so happy
Voller Lebensfreude❤❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Much respect to you kind lady ❤
Thank you for sharing and caring.
Awe.... I Luv' it!!! How beautiful to see such happiness!!! ☺🐶🐕🐾🐾🐾🐾💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
Whatta cool doggo! Just go, go, go. So nice!
I’m glad they can accurately report on something seeing how they failed to report the truth on gaza
Oh, to see the excitement and happiness in his face running down the sidewalk made me smile so much, my face hurt. Simply adorable.❤ Thank you for caring for this amazing dog.
So klasse aber vieleicht noch hinten schuhe anziehen wegen bodenkontagt❤

Glad the doggo is excited, but I hope the owner fixes his harness. Doggo’s feet is dragging…not good.
Улыбается собачка❤в теплоте и в любви❤ благодарю тебя хозяйка❤за твое доброе сердце❤

Just beautiful. ❤
This is so awesome! I love it.
Einfach nur grandios, diese Lebensfreude !!! Trotz Handycap  -- ein toller Hund !!!
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!  They are so precious and have a wonderful hooman!!!!
That is so awesome!!!!…….wonder what that carpet smells like……
Beautiful 😍😍😍
Gotta fix that wheel so he can run more precisely
So precious❤
Uh. They should be leashed and not allowed to just book it. Especially near cars and people. Unless you want the other one in a wheelchair as well. Or worse for either of them. Go to a dog park or something if you want them to be able to be let off.  Such a killjoy, I know. "How dare he want safety for the dogs and people around them."
Don't make us cry
❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Gracias por brindarle tanto amor y felicidad!!❤❤❤
I just got there and for a moment i thought thus doggo just clean itself at carpet
Me alegro tanto con solo ver como corre feliz. Dios te cuide y a tu dueña siempre.
❤❤❤❤
I love you.
🥺❤️
He is so happy with his wheelchair.❤❤❤😂
Go wheelchair dog!!!!
Grazie di cuore 💕 vi amo🙏🏻🐕🙏🏻😍
Many Thanks for your Kindness and good heart
Take the dog to get the leg shaped back in place then you do this
❤❤❤❤
Los amo
Che tenerezza❤
Belleza
Дай Бог здоровья вам и вашим питомцам!!!!
❤❤ The dog is so happy to be able to run.
That chair needs an adjustment. Tha wheels are loose as ive ever seen.
He was off down that street bless
❤❤❤ моя ж ты деточка. Спасибо Боженьке,что у тебя есть любящий ЧЕЛОВЕК и друг❤❤❤
😎🏅🎉👏👏👏
Awe you giving that dog its best life 🙌
Soooo cute😊❤❤❤❤❤❤ danke das du uhn glücklich machst
Merci pour le bien être que vous apporté a ce chien  vous êtes formidable
Da freut sich aber jemand auf sein Wagen
El perrito está súper feliz. Grácias se ve que los amas y ellos te aman y son felices contigo ❤️❤️. Dios te bendiga grandemente 🙏🙏🙏🙏😘😘❤️
Doesn't it hurt the paws dragging them?
I never get tired of clips like these but I always wonder if they couldn't create a harness for the useless back legs....so they don't scrape down to the skin...
He is happy more than a normal dog ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Woooo zoomies 😍😍😍😍😍😍🐕‍🦺🐾🙏🏻
And that's why ladies and gentlemen we'll always have something to learn from dogs
Such a cutie 🐶😻
I'm crying
Makes my day ❤
🙏👍❤️🍀🐶👪💯
There's no quit in that dog is there full of love and love for life
Simplemente hermoso y conmovedor! Dios te bendiga!!!

So sweet  such a lovely family ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ах!! Какие вы молодцы!!! Ваша любовь и забота об этих собачках!! Это героический каждодневный труд!!!!!!? 🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wheelchairs for dogs the best thing invented ❤
👌♥️👌♥️👌♥️👌
so you just let them run around no leash and you live on a busy road....so maybe the other dog can get a chair too?..  the leash doesn't go in his mouth...WTH...
He is so cute and he gets infinite butt scratches on the carpet
Que    momento   fofo🙏🙏👏👏🙌😍
Das ist sooo schön!
You should put somme socquette on her  back legs
He's so happy without even considering his condition! He just wanted to play!❤🙏
Mis vidassss
Ela solta os dois com carro psssndo, eu NÃO faria isso.
So beautiful ❤❤❤
Que momento mas épico y bonito ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤
Повезло собачке с хозяевами!❤
There is so much love, but letting the dogs push through the door and run free is way too dangerous for me. Especially on a busy street
Dogs are the best things in life, bless you all!
Gratidão 🙏
The shear joy and delight that dog exhibits for just being alive and outside is an inspiration to us all. Thank you for raising the quality of all our lives through this act of kindness and respect for all life forms.
AWESOME
Спасибо вам за них!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dog drift ahaahahah
Dog jus gotta run....way to go!
Aww!!!  ♿
Que felicidade.
Love it!  He really enjoys the freedom those wheels provide.
❤
Как же это здорово у собачки улыбка от радости на мордочки😅😊😊😊😊❤
They are just programed for love and joy.
Hola, que fácil es que asta lo perros entienden la diversidad 😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Была б у меня такая собака то у меня бы уже не было собаки
Wouldnt it be funny the reason why the dogs rear legs are fucked is because she doesnt put a leash on the dogs and they just run out with her giggling then he got railed by a car. I mean look how she just lets them run with no care at all its like you people forget these are still animals and dont know any better. My dog is well trained and would never leave my side even but I would never risk just letting him go out running like that if i lived next to a busy ass street.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Imagine the post man's look on his face wen this dog starts chasing him 😅
There is a special place in heaven for every wheelchair made for a dog who needs it.
Awesome Spirit.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Спасибо ❤
😭😭 so cute &happy

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Como  corre con la silla !!!!!!! Que lindo !!!!😊
It should have support for the legs so they don't touch the asphalt (it may cause wounds), and the wheel structure seems too flimsy, I don't think it will last very long.
Love it
Mil gracias a todas esas personas que toman la responsabilidad de ver x animalitos con capacidades diferentes y les dan una vida llena de amor dentro de una familia ❤❤
Lawd!!!! I wanna cry tears of joy.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤  thank you! 💗

God bless❤❤❤❤
Amé su alegría, gracias por darle esa alegría de jugar y correr, no me canso de verlo ❤❤❤

QUÉ HERMOSO!!!!❤....DIOS LOS BENDIGA 💕🌼🧡🥀💛🌻💖🌾🌲💜
Подобрав котенка на улице,выяснилось,что у него задние ноги висят как плети,ветврачи шансов не давали.Я пересмотрела кучу подобных роликов,сайтов,но для котёнков такое не делали.Пришлось купить игрушечный трактор,взять колеса и приладить их к площадке... пока обдумывала,как  сделать чтобы котенок сам подныривал и одевал...Котёнок решил доказать,что его лапы еше послужат!Теперь прекрасеая Серафима -белка.Лапы сильные,хотя она их ннемного ставит и переваливается,получилась модель!

His feet are going to get ground off.
That was amazing how much we love our animals!! where did you get that from? He is ZOOMIN!! 😂 at first I thought he was scratching his butt!!!
❤
You are right the joy is love and excitement  to. Go running and enjoying life his owner has  organised wheels for.  Him. Thank you for the wheels mum
You are absolutely an  angel ❤
I think that wheelchair needs a safety check. Or are those wheels supposed to wobble that bad?
This video made my day.... Sooooooo wonderful ❤
Nothing is as exciting as a dog looking forward to going somewhere. My lab goes nuts when he knows we are about to go for a ride. 😂
At first I didn't know the dog was paralyzed and thought he was just scratching his butt on the carpet
Q AMOR OS DOIS! ❤❤ O CÃOZINHO PINTADO PENSA Q LEVA O AMARELO , É GOLDEN?
Give her little socks for his back feet so they dont scrap the floor :c
Thank you for your caring ❤❤
So uplifting,a beautiful animal.😊

Wie süß das ist❤

God bless this person and her dog! May you have many years of happiness together!!!

Sucks thats your dog is perpetually rubbing its butt on the floor. Carpets must stink.
❤🙏
❤sei una brava persona❤❤❤❤❤
Боже! Слеза прошибает! Какие  люди! Дай бог им здоровья!!!
Awe maaaan, may the creator bless all parties for bringing happiness to the world.
I'm so sorry for this comment but at first I really thought the dog was showing his exitement by rubbing his butt against the carpet (as some old dogs do) 😂 thats what happens when you scroll through the shorts and don't read the captions right away 💀🤣 It started with a weird laugh, and it ended with so much joy for the pup ❤ it's wonderful how the wheelchair gives him his freedom back 🥰
Tan hermoso ❤
Я плпчу 😢от радости, что этот малыш травмирован , но он бегает как здоровый😢❤ у него очень хороший хозяин ангел ❤
At least he,s still excited about life.
Чистая, светлая душа у собак❤❤❤

That is so wonderful. Thank you for caring so much. 😊❤❤
Как я рада за эту собачку, прям до слёз.

God Bless you and your Fur Babies 😢😅🎉❤😂
When you feel the wind blowing through your fur!❤
なんて可愛いぃ子❤🎉 車輪を着けてダッシュで走る姿に感動しました。でも、後ろ足がずーっと引きづってるのでコンクリートで擦り切れ無いだろうかとハラハラしながら見てました。何か足元をカバーする物が有れば安心ですね。いつまでも皆様方にたくさんの幸運が届きます様に御祈りします。
🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤
Beautiful baby.
So very cool the dog can run and play like other dogs! KUDOS,!!

Que máximo!!! Perfeito esse par de amigos!! Que mãe amorosa!! Ela os entende perfeitamente !!!! Feluzes pra caramba!!!❤❤❤❤
Amazingly happy dogs ….. however …Idk but I can’t help but to think that there’s dogs out there that end up in the same health situation by having run outta their front door, without a leash, straight into traffic.
فقط انسانیت و عشق در این کلیپ😢
❤❤❤
Ах ты лапа
❤
This is beautiful! Love to see happy pups!!😂❤❤😊

Que belleza dios mío sin felices con tan poco y sin embargo algunos no hacen lo que deben y miren a ella como los quiere bendiciones
Que alegria 😂, pra ir pra rua, a vida é linda.
This makes me so happy
איך הם שמחים לצאת וואו
I cry🥲
I thought the wheelchair dog was scooting around on purpose, but then I realized… also, pup looks so happy.
This video has made my day, my week, my month. So beautiful to see his/her excitement and joy at being able to move freely. So glad he/she is being taken care of so well and lovingly. Thank you!!!
❤
God bless you❤❤❤❤❤

I swear I thought little guy was violating the carpet.🤷🏾‍♂️🤣
Feliz ese hermoso pichichu poder correr con su hermano.. Gracias a su papá-mamá ❤❤❤
Looks like the one wheel needs some fixing.   Probably from dropping down all those steps and curbs etc.
Thank God for people who care for animals like this
Beautiful Dogs 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
❤
Oooooomygosh they are both sooo precious....they taking themselves on a walk and leaving mom in the dust. Come on catch up mom😂😂😂😂😂😂
That's so sweet ❤❤❤❤
I feel happy better than this dog, i am saying thanks to the owner of the dog.
Glad-'e-ate-more: Snacks-imus Decimus Meridius
How beautiful their friendship is. So lucky to be loved.❤
Thank you for making my day! These videos are inspiring and wholesome.
Sooo great
❤❤❤😅
Meu amor Que fofinho mais lindo ❤
I didn't realise when my eyes became teary
Awesome! Where did you get the wheelchair?  Our baby could use one and we would like to see him as happy as yours.
Cielos, que hermosa peludita, como se emociona porque  va a salir a pasear con su hermano. Dios los bendiga por cuidar de esta belleza y darles el amor que ellos merecen
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wish people were half as appreciative as this dog is Thank you dog mom you are an angel
This made me 😢He is so happy ❤God bless you for giving him joy and a loving home ❤
He is so cute and beautiful
Beautiful ❣️❣️❣️
The person who invented wheeler chairs for dogs and cats must have a special place in heaven. and the people who care for them.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh wow! These pups are truly happy! It takes a special person with love, kindness, and patience. You ma'am have enough to go around! 👏🏾 👍🏽
I'm happy for the dog.  I'm just wondering why you would let them run on a street with cars freely like that. If they run into the road, they can be struck by a car if that didn't already happen, which puts this precious baby in a wheel chair.
You look like God to me
Qué belleza de perrito y su mamá qué corazón tan lindo. Bendiciones infinitas para los dos y para el otro perrito también.
So much happees
Ce bonheur est magnifique a voir
❤ GRACIAS ❤🙏🐾
Amoree❤❤
A felicidade dele poder correr, me emociono

Thank you mam🙏
Parece que el que va en el carrito, lleva su pata trasera arrastrando por el suelo. No se le hará herida????
For second I thought the dog was going to go to the street 😂😂😂lord Jesus
❤❤❤❤❤😍❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🙏🙏🙏
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Qué felicidad hay en el, gracias
❤❤❤😂😂😂
I ❤❤❤ your dogs, and I can tell that they’re very good outside! However I have to say that you are allowing the one dog to walk himself and, while it’s cute and all, it IS illegal, not to mention that it’s nothing but a liability to you, and the public!!! Just saying…
This is beautiful! Are you worried about the back legs dragging and getting a sore from the abrasive ground though?
Why am i also got too excited for him going out?? 🥰🥰🥰
Genial 😂❤malgre son handicap il est heureux ❤quelle magnifiques images ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
I love u guys❤
Bless their little hearts.  I want every dog ever born to have the love and affection and care these dogs get.

Собаке повезло с хозяйкой. Побольше бы таких людей как эта девушка.

Thank you for loving and caring those two cute dogs!
Oh man i feel bad because i was laughing at first. I thought he was just playing around
😂❤
❤❤❤
Why put the leash on you weren't going to hold them. Is that the reason why he needs the wheelchair
Lol the spotted pup just likes the leash I guess 😂😂 running down the walkway 😂 so cute. Doggy with the wheels running like “I’ve got the best legs in town!”
Dogs are the best
❤
Absolutely beautiful!

So adorable 🥰🥰🥰🥰🙏✌️💕😌🇦🇺🌈❤️
Can something be done to lift his back feet further off the ground? Maybe a little sling or something? It looks like his toes are scraping the ground 😢
That’s the best thing that could happen for him😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
She lots of love. Hart warming ❤
So lovely  ,beautiful dogs ,they  love running together ❤ bests mates

I feel so guilty, I laughed at the sight of a silly dog ​​dragging his butt thinking he was having fun, then I realized he was invalid... I feel like garbage

What a beautiful heart you have to take care of this disabled dog.  He is so cute and just loves life.  Bless all of you!
Хозяева— люди с огромным сердцем, любящие животных❤ здоровья им, долгих лет жизни, за то что обрадовали собачку, подарили счастливую жизнь🙏🙏🙏у меня слезы на глазах👍👏💖
Pobrecitos cuantas ancsias de salir a pasear. Pero me parece muy irresponsable que no esten con sus correas porque van tan rapido y puede venir un auto a toda velocidad.  I'm sorry, it is very irresponsible  that you take them out without  their leash. They're so enthusiastic without control that a car can run over  the poor creatures . Becarful, please.
❤❤❤❤
the good old days - what happened to HL... wow...  thanks for reminding us Rach.
The way they were zooming down the street😂 happy pups🫶🏻
Elle est magique❤

SO HAPPY !!!!

Precioso! Beautiful!
Hey! Uhh I have a question.. Can that wheelchair thing be used on daily bases? Cuz I had a puppy back then with broken back legs.(he was a stray dog) He's not anymore but future it might be helpful for other dogs
That's just awesome ❤❤❤
That's amazing !!❤he's so excited to be running !
Please. The dogs are friendly sure it seems but assholes will train their dogs(or just the dogs will learn from their asshole owners ). And it only takes one bad accident to ruin walks forever.  Keep control of your dog until they can get somewhere they're actually safe and free to run.. I'd never wish any harm to anyone but i can't help but see the future.  A dog startling yours, or their owner, escaping and chasing after your poor dogs into an intersection
There both so cute ❤❤❤
What a beautiful soul
THANK GOD FOR BEAUTIFUL DOGS W LIMITED MOBILITY. THEY NEED LOVE TOO😅❤😂
Thanks all of you who caring these kind of animals ❤
Thanks all of you who caring these kind of animals ❤

Leash mom. Leash.. Unless there is no law where you live concerning it.
Probably got that way because she doesn't use a leash right next to a busy street.....

But his foot was dragging it’s gonna get worn 😮😢
This Dog survived Michael Vick.

😂
Hoooo sweet doggy ^^ thks a lot to take care about ^^ I like to say  , if it necassary i sell one eye to help my cat ! trust me i do it for sure ! my cat is my son !

Our German Shepherd does that after he uses the bathroom. He can walk just fine
Thats amazing dear 💕

❤❤❤❤
Oh thank you Jesus for this precious lady that takes such good care of these pups and helps them have the life they love
I didn't read the title thought the wee bugger was just wipong his ass on the ground 😅
I can't help it but whenever i see a dog or cat with  wheels i'm just melting inside <3  always had a weak spot for older pets and handicapt pets, the way they overcome adversity better than mos thumans without a single complaint is amazing <3
That poor baby. Makes me 😢 😭 cry
Wow truly so very kool😍
What a sweetheart. Thank you for giving him the chance to be playful and independent ❤
❤❤
Dogs can teach man so much lessons
I think you should tighten the left wheel, it's way to wobbly.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
Do them back paws need booties when walking outdoors?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🥹🥹🥲
This warms my heart ❤
Thought he was scratching!
The smile on that pup's face is Marvelous! 😃 Thank you, mama, for having such a Huge heart!! Thank you for loving both of your puppies. They obviously love you equally as much. Perfect!  🐶🤗🐶❤️
This video just made my whole day! So much good in one place. Bless y'all!
❤
Oh baby your mamma loves you so much
Nature took legs though by giving, You gave legs though by not giving. An act of God 🫀🧠
So much joy! If only I had it...
Love it that this pup can live a full life!
❤❤❤❤❤
I'm not crying. The awesomeness of this dog/ owner just got into my eyes, is all...😢
I love this ❤

Fur baby took off! So happy and excited ❤
Bless you. ❤ he looks so free and happy
Wouldn’t let your dog run in the city like that cars don’t have feelings
Ohhh man the golden looks so happy to just be able to run...bittersweet
Trop jolie 🥰
You are incredible for giving these dogs their best lives.
Both fine dogs !
That is great that the dogs get the run. But you should’ve put thier leash on them for protection.
Bless You Guy ❤❤❤
I don't need no stinking ramp... I can jump the steps....😊
Check for accidental skid marks on the rug
AWESOME!! Thankyou for giving them such love and beautiful lives ❤❤❤❤❤
What a beautiful dog mom…you are an angel ❤
Какие молодцы хозяева у этой собаки. Они подарили ей новую жизнь. ❤
Cute video but what good does the leash do if you don't hold it. What if an aggressive dog comes out of nowhere?
❤❤❤
مسكين هذا الطفل كم يعاني!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🥰
You're a good dog-Mum! ❤️
Gratidão Gratidão Gratidão ✨
Tighten up the bolts on the wagon
No stairs are going to stop him ❤and his friend who holds his own leash is awesome 😊brilliant 👏 thanks for giving them the best life possible ❤
Feel that ❤❤❤
Letting them take off runny, away from her,  near public streets and traffic is dangerous!😢❤
Yang coklat larinya kencang banget walaupun kakinya sakit 😢
Even with a disability it don't slow this pooch down
Thank you for your kind heart and patience!!! Your dogs are so loved
I LOVE IT. 🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘

😊
Fantastica per questi cani.
Precious 😊
He looks so Happy. Just if u can try n put his legs up so that he won't drag them. U don't want him to get hurt. 🙏💜
Doesn't the back paws get rubbed raw from dragging some?
I loved it. But then the Karen in me was scared that another dog would come outta no where and hurt your baby. And how do you know the other one won't run into the road? I'd be so scared. But love the love you obviously share. ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Please tell me that dogs name isn't Forrest (Gump) 😂😂😂 those weels look like they're about to part ways lol
Beautiful! Makes me cry.  Jett
So sweet, my 13 yr old black lab takes his lead and walks hisself too! He used to take his little sissy as well but she passed last year. So precious!🙏🤟♥️🐕‍🦺
Simply precious.
If only humans could learn from animals like that. Precious
a very luck dog.
The way he is looking at you! Come on, mom, hurry!!!! Question Does his foot ever drag the ground? Just wondering ❤These pups are so happy ❤❤❤
Ohhhh que ternura ❤❤❤
Thank you for loving her and giving her a new life😊
It's just wonderful ❤❤❤❤
So glad to see hes a happy boy again 😊

Lovely to see
He is not my dog but I am so grateful for your care and love towards this beautiful dog
At first I thought the dog was so happy to go outside that it was scratching it's butt, then I continued to watch the video and it eased my mind for a moment🥲🥲.
Oh trimksh org naik,anjing itu kliatanya bhagia dg alat bantunya dan bisa bebas berjalan2👍👍
Pure Lebensfreude 🙏🙏🙏
Nice but still nasty, I'd never eat there. People are nasty, skin chips and dog or cat fur and feces licked plates too
It does my heart good to watch this women make sure her crippled dog continues to have a active life  ! 👍 ❤❤❤
Que alegria do cãozinho
So sweet ❤
Aww❤

Obrigado!!!❤
What a beautiful thing. Thank you for being an amazing person.
Benditos dueños
Eine tolle Frauchen und nun der Hunde hatte, anerkennt die Leistung dieser Frau.
Appreciate this ❤ But also made me think why we can care this much for animals more than we can for other humans.. and i think because they have the ability to be happy despite the ‘unfortunate’ situation. This joy makes us feel like we’re doing something right.
So beautiful
Lindo!!muñeco disfruta tu regalo!!!
You be blessed for giving that dog such a great Life 👍👏👏👏
Sweet babies 💋
リードの意味よ😂❤

Dogs always teach us so many lessons.  Have fun TODAY...DO YOUR BEST WITH WHAT YOU HAVE.  DONT FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSRLF!  GREAT POST!
awesome video, Dog is so happy to be able to run around
You should keep the dogs on a leash until you get to a park/open space Just because you love to let your dogs run free, others don't
素敵な映像をありがとう。 この子は、走れる喜びを感じているでしょう。いつまでも、この子と家族が幸せである事を祈っています。

Mom, you're the best!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🐕😚
That's sweet =) Maybe you should try putting a strap to secure his back legs under his belly ? It would prevent them from dragging on the sidewalk and getting hurt.
Super excited actually

even though animals dont have soul. dont batter it just to give it wheels

I got a wheelchair like that for my last dog, I'd advise you Rigg a type of sling to protect the back legs
FANTÁSTICO, GENIAL..😂😂❤❤
Please be careful having them off leash
Это великолепно 😊

The other dog just running with the leash 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow, that was a stupid move; letting the dogs run away near traffic. You have a leash on your dog so why not use it or, is the decision up to your dog?
Que bonito!!❤👍☺️🐕‍🦺🐶
And that's why I need to pay attention before I speak.
Que hermoso 😍se ve tan feliz 😃
Allah razı olsun amin

I have a dog that needs a wheelchair. Ours is difficult to put on. That one looks a Lot easier to put on. What kind of wheelchair do you have?
Happy doggie
Thought he was doing your carpet dirty at the beginning! I'm sorry, just turns out that you are amazing pet owners and people.
I love dog. ❤❤
This just made my day. And I’ve been sad all day and this literally made me smile again
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
Que felicidad❤❤❤
Dejarlos sueltos nunca será opcional, otro perro suelto y lo pueden lastimar, los racionales somos los humanos, o podria tirar alguna persona, pensemos en todo con respeto, y soltarlo en una zona donde pueda correr sin autos, bicis, étc , también ellos podrían salir lastimados también, educación no emociones
Eres una bendición 😇 cuidas bien  de ese angelito saludós de Perú 🇵🇪❤️🇵🇪❤️🇵🇪 Cusco mágico ❤️🇵🇪
That needs adjusted so the toes arnt getting worn away, fantastic idea id bet whoever invented this had a dog who can't walk.

Here i am bout to talk shyt about the dog dragging its butt across the floor. Then i see its wheel-chair😢. Im sorry. Keep up the good work
This is awesome
Bless you, sweet lady. You are giving both dogs a wonderful life but with your disabled one especially, you are showing great love and selflessness for loving and giving the extra care he requires. ❤🥺💜
🥹 We had 3 disabled dogs growing up (2 who couldn’t use their back legs and 1 who was born without eyes) and they were all truly a blessing to everyone who ever met them. I don’t know how you can feel sorry for yourself when you have a disabled doggo that’s just happy to be alive and to be loved.
Que bênção este animal poder andar 👏👏👏🐕🐕🤗
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😊😊😊
Danke, für die Liebe auch zu Kranken Hunden ❤❤❤👍👍🙏

Tube un gran amigo con ese problema,pero con horas de masajes que con pasiencia le daba y su gran tenazidad,logramos revertir el diagostico terrible que nada se podia hacer,no caminaria jamas,pero con fe y trabajo constante en conjunto lo logramos y vivio unos cuantos años mas ,caminando y asta corriendo casi normal. El cancer se lo llevo a los mas de 15 años.❤
Έχεις τόν απόλυτο σεβασμό μου πού φροντίζεις αυτή την όμορφη ψυχούλα ό Θεός να σέ έχει πάντα καλά ❤❤❤
Love it
Sos una gran mamá con tus hijos de 4 patas 😍🇦🇷💜

Eu também  tenho uma enorme admiração,  por quem adota, e ainda mais nessa situação Deus te abençoe sempre
Жалко,а я подумала что пёсик жопу вытерает 😢
While see the cuteness can't ignore the fact that the other dog is holding a leash in the mouth and running 😂 the dog is like "if i have a leash i can go out right"🤣

Wow thats so nice to see
❤❤❤❤❤❤parece que ele já sabia oque era 😅🎉🎉🎉😂
That is probably the most beautiful video I’ve seen in a long time. People always put their dogs down when they can’t walk in the back legs I say should make some kind of roll thing for them.
👍👍👍👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🇧🇷
Ты мой малыш, не перестаешь радоваться жизни, молодец😘
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Por un momento pensé que se estaba rascando .
At first i thought they were just dragging their bottom on the floor like a dog with an itchy bottom. But then you brought out the doggy wheel chair and I was like how adorable.
❤❤️❤️👍
ای جونم،درود خداوند بر شما خانم مهربان
❤
Watch out! One of those wheels looked like it was ready to spin off.  Cute as hell, tho. They’re the best.
Hermosa su felicidad❤
LOVE LOVE LOVE❤

So beautiful 😍
Какая вы умница, дарите радость в жизни этого прекрасного песика, так мало нужно для счастья, ходить и радоваться жизни! 😊
I'm going to admit the "doggy wheelchair" took me by surprise, my initial thought at the start was the dog had worms and was scratching his butt on the carpet.
This is so awesome
What a lovely mother you are. God bless you.
I LOVE THE NO DOG LEFT BEHIND SYNDROME ❤❤❤❤❤
Joy tear in my eyes 🥹
Emocionante ver a alegria desses animais queridos e felizes com a vida que foi proporcionada a eles. Deus abençoe quem adota um cachorrinho especial.❤❤❤❤
Momma they r so excited 😂
That's how our cat got rid of clinging poop. Except he went bump bump bump down the carpeted stairs.
Unfortunately most normal people could never afford anything near would it cost to get that dog squared away into that unit unfortunately 90% of the dogs in this condition are going to be put down the cost of treating your dog a lot of times is much more than treating a person
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bravissima ❤
Omg the wheelchair dog is why to cute can't wait to go outside both are cute
😂❤I truly love speed racer! He doesn't have a care in the world, both are happy and healthy! Sincerely, kudos to you!🐾🐾👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🐾🛞🛞❤
The happiest mfcker I saw in a long time ❤️❤️❤️❤️
We have the same dog, it's a pity that our stroller won't allow the dog to run so freely❤
🥰
she has been waiting for so long for zat😊
Regards to you! May God bless you always 🙏
This video makes me so happy thank you for sharing it . Maybe a little bag or strap on the back so the feet don’t drag ? Or not you know best. Again thank you 🙏
LOVE❤🙏 BEAUTIFUL 🙏❤ BLESSINGS 🥀

God bless you for helping this dog and I'm sure he will 👍🐾
Eres genial pero no creés que la altura de las ruedas traseras es insuficiente para que no arrastre la patitas traseras y se haga  daño con el roce del suelo
Ahora.¿ quien podrá atajarme? Nadie 😂😂😂😂😂
You are having great heart
If this ain’t the sweetest thing! She deserves to run through a field of wildflowers! You can  really tell how much they are loved and cared for 🐾❤

Que bello el corriendo
Freaking awesome!
0lha a alegriaaaaa...❤😊
You are a REAL hero..or should I say SHEro❤❤
So wonderful that dogs don’t feel any of the emotional trauma we would - they’re just thrilled with being alive - and when it gets too bad and they’re in pain or suffering, we can help them - I wish there was someone to do that for me when I get terminal  -
Bless its heart
That works great. Good luck and all love. ❤❤❤

😂этот с поводком во рту втопил.
This is great. Seems like the feet do drag a bit at times- there has to be a way to stop that 🤔
А задние лапы не трутся об асфальт?
Спасибо вам за радость и любовь, которую получают ваши питомцы.❤
Сколько же счастья в этих глазках 😍😍😍
Какая любовь к собакам. Смотрите, учитесь!
Where are the brakes ?
Tears of joy and happiness for that Precious baby💜💜💜🖤🖤🖤
that's great but still keep them on a leash. you don't know what you could encounter l. Another under socialized dog, dog with severe anxiety (like mine), a scared person who could be violent to a dog out of fear, or how about a car driving down the freakin street.
❤❤❤
😊😊😊 eres buen corazón.quieres mucho a tus bebés peluditos 🥰😘🐕🐕
❤❤❤❤è adorabile e tu per lui sei tutto
He probably got like that being off leash this video is annoying because the woman is careless
Thank you fur momma!
He needs a little net so his back legs don't drag on the ground 😢 other than that was a happy doggo
God bless you❤❤❤
Le zampine dietro mi pare gli toccano per terra, mettergli qualcosa per ripararle, povero tesoro vederlo correre felice è bellissimo...
❤
Thank u☺️
Hermosos! Verlos trae alegría...❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cuanto amor por los animalitos, Dios la bendiga siempre ❤
See how happy she is,xxxxx
🙏🙏🙏
Uno de los mejores inventos para nuestras pequeñas mascotas, una gran ayuda ,para una mejor calidad de vida 😊
God bless. ❤❤❤
Маленький солнышко, так себе все задние лапки изотрет, надо либо лапки к верху коляски крепить, либо, коляску по выше, пушистик так трётся лапками обо все, пол, асфальт😢 Самый золотой и самый милый пушистик, ты умничка, радуется жизни, хозяйке, вы умничка, что такого милого ребёночка любите и заботитесь о нем, целую его в носик❤😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰
Bro forgot to use their 30 day warranty on their dog.
Oh mein Gott wie süß diese Hunde sind,alle beide❤ Ich finde es so wunderhübsch das es Mensch wie dich gibt und dem Hund eine Chance geben. Klasse
Humanity at its best. Thank you ma'am for taking care of such animal.👏👏👏👏🙏

You need to be responsible and leash your dogs. You don’t own the sidewalk
Got to fix that wheel
Süper

Lovely girl making a pup VERY HAPPY.. ♥️♥️♥️

後ろ姿が嬉しさでいっぱいだ❤
So viel Spaß am Leben...

Running off leash! That couldn't be how the dog wound up that way, could it? Lack of care for the dogs and the public.
Que linduras ❤
Tem muito amor involvido
I love this so much.
Felicidad ❤
Che amori❤❤ che gioia nonostante  tutto❤
Alhamdulillah...this video make me smile 😊
In my country one would be sued if they had a dog who had paralyzed backlegs. "It's animal cruelty to allow them live in constant pain"...
❤❤❤❤🐕❤🐕❤🐕❤ ohh melting heart ❤❤❤❤
Wow...!!!...❤❤
So cute❤❤❤
This makes me so happy
❤
Linda tu vida junto  a ese  angelito 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Hermoso! Muy emocionante..
La cara de felicidad de ese perro es impagable
I love this….. expect for the fact that they’re the type to let their dog roam free…… I’ve had and seen so many bad experiences from my own dog being around “good dogs” not on a leash come to my dog ON A LEASH and my dog attacked them. Now my dog is a well trained cocker spaniel but she never got along with other dogs. She only was ever around my brothers dogs and they got into it a few times and that got me very upset they put them together KNOWING they both are territorial. Other dogs are like that as well!! They can attack your dogs when they’re not leashed. I honestly think it’s so irresponsible. Let them roam around at a park. Not on a public sidewalk or street. Dog parks are meant for social dogs.
idem
Lovely❤
When you thought he wanted a walk but instead it was an ass race !
Sorry still should be responsible and put leashes on
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Preciosura hermosa ❤❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You might want to tighten those wheels
serve your right doggie🤣🤣
Mo ii s n escia li omm

What a happy dog!!
I needed this today
You my dear are an angel. Always remember this and I wish you the best in life. Anybody who takes care of a dog like that should be taken care of to the highest level❤
Unfair advantage he has wheels.  This is great and a lot of love.
Tighten that wobbly wheel up to keep the joy going
❤❤❤
Pure joy 🥲
Que lindo!!!
Maravilloso (sr le ve feliz🐕💞🙏🐕🐕
I seen some dogs like this as I have been traveling different states. Always puts a smile on my face that people do this for dogs that are otherwise healthy and keep them alive. Many put animals down, it's so sad. Bless these people and their doggies. ❤
❤🐕🐶🦮🥰
That sure is a precious baby you have there
💝🙏💝💞💞💞💞💞💞
Wheelchair.😂 chair implies sitting. It's a wheelbarker 😂
الله الله الله الله شكرآ لك 🎉🎉❤❤
That is a beautiful sight.  They are both so happy.  I have said it before.  Every dog and cat who can't walk deserves a set of wheels.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤
that carpet must be rancid
Такая довольная несётся😂
Бежит собака, поводок волочится... Рядом машины летят... Один прыжок- и ещё один инвалид обеспечен. Хозяйка веселится, а у собачки- инвалида лапка по асфальту ширкает. В кровь сотрёт.😢😢😢
THANKS ❤
Esas son las cosas que me hacen el día ❤❤❤gracias por cuidarlo y amarlo
love it
That is the most precious dog I have ever seen❤
Thank You so much for what You are doing for him🙏😇💙🐶💪💪💪💪👏👏👏👏
This touched my heart. This is so kind.  We need more humans like u 😊
She needs shoes so she doesn't hurt her precious paws from dragging. They are so adorable 🥰🥰🥰
Как он рад.он счастлив.Человеческое спасибо хозяйке собаки ❤❤❤❤❤
What a hero, no what beautiful HEROS! THANK you so much!!
Great to see them going out for a run.  Am a bit worried about the road though.  I think you may have to prop up those rear legs as they seem to be dragging on the ground, maybe cause another injury.
Bendiciones...
😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
TENDERLY
You never know when there are untrained dogs out there, and they will attack your dogs, and then you don't have their leashes and there's no way to pull them away from harm.  She thinks she lives out there by herself in the country.  The first thing her dogs met were people walking around.  So wrong.
❤❤❤
Thank you for caring 🐕
Wow.  That's amazing
Happy!  HAPPY HAPPY!!!!❤❤❤❤
C'est beau de voir un chien 🐶🐶🐕🐕 heureux malgré le son siège à roulettes et son compagnon qui le motive c'est génial. Vous êtes formidable

❤❤❤
Heartwarming ❤......
The other dog was like "No time to waste! Don't worry, I'll grab the leash and walk myself"
💞 very happy pooch - you're a marvellous owner!! Other mate also brilliant.

I thought doggy was just scooting the butt for a sec.
They really need to be kept on leashes though around other people. Not everyones huge fans if dogs. Not everyone likes it when a dog runs up to them on a sidewalk.
Какая ты умничка❤❤❤ спасибо что помогла 🙏🙏🙏

Love this 💔
It’s really sweet but hold your dogs leash that’s I would feel really uncomfortable if the first dog ran by me like that. Super inconsiderate.
Спасибо за собачек! ❤
Tenerezza!!!!❤❤❤❤
Such a beautiful sight
❤
❤🙏🤝👏👏👏💪🙋‍♂️🎩
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Da igual lo que les pase, los perretes sirmpre quieren lo mismo ....una buena familia que les ame ❤
That "Excuse Us" was so all in one polite manner ❤
I love it! One gets wheels, and the other carries their leash! ❤ mad respect for your compassion!
Oh mein Gott wie er sich freut trotz seiner Behinderung das ist so cool, die pure Lebensfreude.❤❤❤❤❤
😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😊🎉
THANK YOU!🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤СПАСИБО ВАМ, ЗА ТО, ЧТО ТАК ЛЮБИТЕ ЭТУ СОБАЧУЛЮ🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️

Thank you for giving this poor dog a chance.. the dog is still positive and teaches us a lesson in tenacity
Her right foot scrapes
Just precious
Love it!❤❤
The dog can freely run with the wheelchair. Good.
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Me encanta esa cara de felicidad ❤❤
Put your dogs on a leash 🙄
Put your other dog on leash
Love it'
My 1st thought was " he is really dragging his butt all over thst carpet " 😂 He was so stinking cute when he dove off the steps. Super pup to the rescue.  !!!!😊
Einfach nur 💕
❤
You're a beautiful person taking care of that dog
I love you all so much.😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
His foot is hitting the ground...maybe a better lift I know the boots fall off...
So sweet
❤
Did the dog hit the tree? They are cute, but you should guide them better so that no accidents happen.
Sétálni.. ❤❤
Aww, this is just the sweetest video.  To see the excitement frm both of the doggies is just so sweet n cute💕
Please put something soft on the insides of those metal wheel axles, or padded long socks on doggies hind legs. It’s hitting his ankles.  My dear late friend used a wheelchair and when her foot repeatedly hit the metal of the foot area she couldn’t take it anymore.  Be aware of it because he can’t tell you.
V cute but that one wheel looks awfully wobbly! Eek!
❤❤❤❤
This makes me so happy!
God bless you 😇🙏
Look how Happy ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤😊
Oh so excited! !! Hehe that is so cute.

Precious.
Good morning 😮😊🙏
His back right foot drags on the pavement... that's not good??
Блин, а правая задняя лапешка трется о землю. Поранить может. Не чувствует, ведь, её.
God bless you   for the love and support you give your dog, you have a pure heart ❤️.
Господи, спасибо тебе, что такие люди есть в нашей жизни❤ Пусть они всегда будут здоровы и счастливы
One walks itself, and the other rolls on! Precious. We could be besties
Gracias por compartir tanta felicidad
even without the ability to wag tail you can tell the excitement
❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤
yes! dogs with disabilities deserve happy lives
Should have a resting strap so them legs dont dangle n get caught...
Под лапки надо сумочку или петельки чтоб по земле не шкрябались и не бились.
🫶🏻😍🎉
Super Cuties!!! ❤❤❤❤ 😢 I miss my babies watching these sweet babies.
love❤
❤
Si sweet they can't wait to go outside!
I am SO in love with this video❤❤❤❤ . Thank you for giving this sweetheart great quality of life!
👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Put a sock on that lil foot that was dragging. God bless you for helping him.
Love it❤❤❤😂😂😂
What a wonderful invention! It gives the doggo freedom!
This video is so so cute ❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊
You have to be a different type of stupid, smooth brained, and irresponsible to think it's ok to let your untrained dogs run free in residential areas, especially if they're already disabled/handicapped. And people should not have to get out of your dogs ways handicapped how letting them run all over with no regard or respect to others, their space and safety.
Какие они радостные!!! Как они любят гулять!!! Вы молодец,что собаке инвалиду подарили счастливую жизнь!!!
Мое большое уважение к Вам дорогая добрая девушка!!!
I love dogs so much 😭🥹
Need to put some little boots on her paws so she's not dragging her back paws on the concrete.
Вот это нашим гражданам нужно внимательно посмотреть и поучиться у американцев❤ Доброте и пониманию!
Me encantó este video ❤❤❤
There is no better expression of the love his/her life. Joy. Just running with a buddy, having a loving friend who will strap you into the wheelchair that makes running in the breeze possible.  Love is abundant from on sides in this clip including his dog friend who is saying "open the door please. Open please please "
People who don't use a leash for their dogs and let them run loose in public like that are irresponsible pets owners, should not have dogs, and shouldn't be allowed to have any. ESPECIALLY if it's handicapped. How smooth brained, reckless, immature and irresponsible does one have to be to not only not walk your dogs on a leash (or in this case, have it, but STILL CHOOSE NOT TO USE IT), but to not have them trained not to take off like that. ESPECIALLY when you have a disabled dog. She's reckless and irresponsible. Nothing about this is cute or funny (except the dogs).
Amazing! He has a wonderful life !
God bless you and your kind heart for believing in them and giving them a life they deserve ❤️ 🙏 ♥️ 💗 you watch many blessings will come your way
Your an angel Lady!!!
Cute but very deadly for your Dogs Let them run around like that without their leashes on
Que bendicion para ellos tener a una madre tan amorosa ,d Dios te bendiga mama junto a tus firulais .❤❤❤
So precious 💕😍😍💕💕😘😘😘
😢❤❤

That boy just flew down the front steps so eager to start the fun. And the other one didn't even have time to wait for u but decided to just walk/run himself out. How awesome their world is, thanks to you.
Omg! That's so precious! Thank you for taking such good care of this sweet baby!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
What a great device. Looks so easy to use!
This is a beautiful thing !!! Simply beautiful!!!
Beautiful baby ❤
Protect the paws that rub...right???otherwise he will get hurt 👌👋😅
The one dog snapping up that leash like, "Yes yes, I got it! LET'S GOOO!!"
So cute. Lucky dog, lucky owner💚
You are truely a special person!
Your so good for taking care of a disabled dog, but shouldn't his back legs be held up higher so they do not get caught in any way or hurt?!  He is so blessed to have you as a mom or dad or both.  He looks so happy bless him.
God bless u for taking such good care of them. God keep them protected.. ❤ .

Those are the most precious zoomies. You can just see how happy she is to run. 🥰
Gracias a Dios
Thank you for giving that that wonderful dog a chance
God Bless you all.❤
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
pls use a leash!! i’m not saying this because of how your dogs behavior is or that your dog would do something but because of other dogs that may not be trained well or do well with other dogs and it can end pretty badly for either party.
Sweetest thing ever! Wheels was Gettin it 🙌🏼
He is so lucky to have a loving home and good walks. Please make sure your dogs are leashed for their safety as well as others❤️
So sweet
❤❤❤❤❤
May God bless you 🙏 😊
🎉🎉🎉
Beyond BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤❤❤❤
My dog is partially paralyzed. You want to know why we can't go on walks? Because people like you don't put their dogs on a leash. If your dog runs up to my dog it's going to get dealt with because my dog does not like other animals. You're the reason I can't even take my dog for a walk. That's inconsiderate. It doesn't matter how cute your dogs are.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
Great humans
Entstehen an den Hinterpfoten keine Wunden, wenn sie so über den Teer schkeifen?
Oh snap! I thought he was rubbing his ass on the carpet. My bad .
❤❤❤😊
Cute. But please leash them for their own safey.
sweetness❤
she should also lift his back legs so they don't rub from dragging and get hurt as a result
❤❤❤
For handicap animal, the wheelchair must be the best thing in life for them besides there owners
People like this are amazing.  They didn’t take the high road and make it easy.  They chose a pup who really needed them and turned him’ or her😉’ into a family member. What a beautiful video ….and just amazing people.
God bless you
Lindo, que D +
❤❤❤❤❤ God bless you
Omg....look how happy he goes!❤❤❤
Love this! You are a great Mom❤❤❤❤❤❤😂
Down the stairs even!😂 how lovely❤
Oh my gosh! I thought he was just expressing his glands on the carpet!😂😂😂😂😂😂 so glad you're helping the poor guy out
Qué felicidad tiene jajaja!!!! Dios te bendiga siempre por hacerlos tan feliz!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Ти найкраща жінка на світі
Как же хорошо,что есть такие добрые люди,спасители!!!😊❤❤❤
I cried tears of happiness to see a BEAUTIFUL ANGEL ALINE YOU give these BEAUTIFUL DOGS a FUN, LOVING HAPPY HOME. TY💙💙💙💋💙💙💙
It's The Excitement For Me! I'm Excited That He's Excited😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
❤❤❤
No me canso de verlos! Y el manchis, toma con su boca su correa de paseo!!! Que inteligentes y amorosos❤!!! Dios los bendiga! 🙏
Your dogs are not on a leash what is up with that aren't there leash laws in your neighborhood
So cute
Oh que feliz sale corriendo a disfrutar del paseo!!!
They are both so precious, thank you for sharing them with us. 😊
Good smile
So, basically the one dog knows how to walk himself. Good doggy. No stopping the friend either. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
They are adorable!
Вот так собак выпускать без поводкаи вторая собака будет на коляске. Автомобиль не может мгновенно остановиться.  И хозяйке необходимо подумать перед тем как выгуливать собак.
Oh, my heart is melting over his enthusiasm! What a champ!!!
They make me smile. What sweet loves❤
This made my whole day 😊 that's happy 😊  all over ❤️
Omg! The best video ever!!! ❤
Как собачка счастлива! Что может так побегать.😊 Спасибо, вам!

That’s a really heart warming ❤
The other one just run off carrying his leash 😂.
Only da best for you and da doggos ❤❤❤
What kind of dog is the black and white one? And kudos for contributing such a nice role in the handucapped dogs life!
Thank you for being an awesome pet owner!
What a sweet dog. Hugs baby. Your awesome. ❤
Sweet babies
I liked this video twice for good measure
🥰He needs a lift for his hind feet. Dragging a little. Such a happy boy.
I have huge respect for people who adopt and/or foster disabled animals.
The dust is so thick in here I can't type
Thank you for giving that poochie a good life.
So cute❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Parabéns, que Deus  te proteja
That's a couple of beautiful animals you have there, and bubby they can run , your so blessed thank you for loving them,😊, coming from Hattiesburg Ms USA 😊
❤
Que gran persona eres ❤
Bless your heart for taking care of these sweet babies 💖.
Some socks would be nice for the dog in the wheelchair to protect his hide feet from banging on the sidewalk and wheelchair. Cute that they take themselves for a walk/run playtime...😊😊😊
They’re so happy & you’re so sweet & wonderful ❤ Not sure why I’m crying😊
I wish i had that for my beautiful rough collie 30 years ago. I miss Ruchi to this day 🙏
Cuanto AMOR !!! TE ADMIRO MUJER,POR  ESE ❤ TAN BELLO QUE TIENES🎉
❤❤❤
You have at heart made of gold.
Great, the care and the love that doggie gets❤ But I hope you have some good old hemorrhoid cream for his poor butt😂
At first I was like he has worms now I'm like he is a worm
Oh my goodness they are adorable ❤😊
So cute.  God Bless you.
❤ oh I'm in love giggle giggle giggle
❤
Пошло-поехало )
❤❤❤❤❤
Id be worried about the dogs toes n paws getting cut or even fricktion burns from asphalt n cement. With that aside your a great loving owner.
Hermoso.video❤❤❤
Thats just beautiful... Try to get his wheels updated, before one falls off.
This is the best thing ever
That is so Awesome and cool and sweet all rolled up into one!!!!❤😂
Aaaahh so cute but I get really scared streets sometimes they don't even know the danger of the streets
You guys are wonderful people. May God bless all you and your fur babies days❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️💯❤️❤️❤️
Well that just made my day! ❤
I love that one pup grab the leash , and he'll control it😅😅
❤❤❤ Thank You  "Jesus " 😊
That’s superscooty she was hit by a car in Mexico
I am so sorry, I thought that the dog was just scratching his itchy butt on the floor.  My apologies.  I am glad that he got to go out for a walk.  You have made his life joyful.
speeding ticket
This doggy made my day
Lol wheels bout to fall off
That Makes me so happy to see this
❤❤
Love the dogs. Why are they running on a busy street without a leash?  They could run in the street....unless I am missing something
❤
❤️❤️
What a sweeie,your wonderful for making him happy.❤😊
Preciososssss❤❤❤❤❤
That is so amazing! Thank you for showing how happy that pup is even with his disability ❤❤❤ Way to go Mom!
So adorable
That is literally the most beautiful thing I have seen today put a big smile on my face that sweet baby just living its life
So cute.❤  His back legs are dragging. Can they be harnesses as well or some booties for protection?
Bless you nice lady.😢😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
O dono deste animal não deverá estar a favor da Eutanásia, não vos parece? Senão faria como os que estão a favor: Que Em vez de lutarem por aumento dos cuidados paliativos para evitar o sofrimento, votam a favor de matar para se verem  livres de quem os incomoda.
To be honest, I've always thought any animal so disabled would never enjoy life again, certainly never have a good quality of life! Watching your video, I stand corrected! The happiness in your two dogs playing and running together, enjoying themselves, especially the disabled one, is just heart-warming to see! I hope your dogs continue to have many years of fun and joy!
I love it. Everything about the video , loveeeee it
Qué belleza!!❤❤
Whoever invented the Wheelies for Dogs should be knighted or get the respect of the highest Order. Some people become knighted etc because they've been on the telly but inventing these devices so dogs can walk and run again is soooo fantastic. ♥️🇬🇧♥️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My heart ❤
I love the happy dogs.. but it's still irresponsible to let them run free instead of safely on the leash.  My dogs are a little leash reactive, and we always cross the street or do things to get out of people's way with oncoming doggies... But if your dog has a leash dragging on the ground and just ran up to us, it could be dangerous for all pets involved. Being responsible is the same as being compassionate. Those two work together
🩵🩵🥹
Could u please check his back legs r touching the floor  b careful pleaseeeeee
What a wonderful life you have given this beautiful fur baby. You are an awesome mama to these babies and I thank you for this wonderful life these babies enjoy. You can see how happy they are and so excited to be outside. Bless you and your babies, much love and plenty of hugs for you all. ❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂
You lost me at off leash and next to a busy road. Seriously 😒
Dzięki takim ludziom jak Pani warto żyć na tym świecie 🌹 wszystkiego dobrego 🌟👁️👁️♥️
This is so cute...however I see a potential disaster with that traffic and two doggies running next to it without their leashes. 😮
Made my day.  Bless the dog
❤😢 amazing dog, stays happy no matter the circumstances.
There's no doubt she's going to Heaven.
🥰
When you're dog rubs his rump on the carpet he may have a problem, good to check it out.
They are beautiful,  that's put a big smile on my face ,seeing these two so happy ❤
This is the whole some and right way to treat man's best friend and maybe women's too 😂❤❤
Keep your dogs on a leash
So incredibly precious 💕😊
❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m just like wondering.. why they’re off leash…
OMGosh!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🙏😇🙏💖👏👏👏👏👏👏💖❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️I Love that Dog and All of You for being Soooo AWESOME to her!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
I will say it again people like you are living proof that angels 😇 live among us god bless
If i were your neighbor id stabilize both those wheels so that it tracks as smoothly as possible.  That wobble on the right wheel is giving me anxiety.  ❤
Малышь,солнышко будь здоров.
Несётся как ветер! Какое счастье! Супер!
Front wheel drive dog. Cool!
I had a dog in wheels for most of the last year of her life. Such a blessing! Jade Suede got to go out and still enjoy walking and exploring and sniffing and being a real dog! Those wheels made the last part of her life so much better than it would have been.
You’re an angel on Earth 😇 Deepest respect and a true joy to watch. We feel the love and joy. Thank you 💛🧡🤎
Bendiciones 🥰
❤❤❤❤❤❤
POOR BABY! He's a real trooper though!  Good for him!
I love them, they are 😍  adorable!!
Amore....

That left tire
This is so sweet ❤❤❤
wonderful owner, wonderful dogs.
Feliz de la vida, para el no es impedimento,

What's the  purpose of the leash if you dont put it on?!?!
The dog is walking him self lol
He's loving it💋💋💋💋💋💋
💚💚💚
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤
And then they don't put him on a leash??  You're the type of person that gets mad at a driver for your dog getting hit, yet it is your fault.  It is dangerous in many ways to let a dog off a leash, especially a special needs dog.  Wait until the dog park and follow the rules.  Dont just brush off the rules and put your dog in harms way!
So cute. Both dogs were so excited to go outside! 🐶🐶❤️❤️😊😊
It's great this dog has a good life but...there is a leash law and you are not obeying the law!  The dog is special, you not so much!
💖💖💖💖💞🐶🐶👏👏👏🤗
I’m so sorry but it looks like the pup is doing better 🎉❤😊
Imádom.  Van benne életöröm.❤
Que lindo!
Amore meravigliosa tu e l altro cagnolone❤❤❤❤
Que preciosos
He always wipes.
Beautiful!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Anything to keep that dog happy 😊
Mapercarità
Thought his butt itched💀😭
One of the sweetest, happiest faces! Love the enthusiasm! This dog clearly doesnt know theeaning of the word "disabled" like so many people in similar situations.
So much joy what a happy girl ❤
Like how 1st dog walks himself
I just love your babies ❤
Thanks for taking care of this angel !!!
I freaking love dogs😂😂😂❤❤
😭❤️❤️❤️🐶🐾🥰😘 go baby go
God bless her 🫶🏻🙏🏻🫡
So cute reminds me when I take my pup for a walk❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Puppy is like get out the way.... here I come 😂😂❤❤❤
dog is so excited... mmelts my heart
What a fantastic fabulous dog!!! Sooo full of energy and enthusiasm for life !!! Gorgeous!! We done everyone involved !!!
❤🙏😊
Bless the doggies 💜❤️❤️❤️💜
That wheel was wobbling like crazy haha
Wonderful
Omg he is sooooo cute❤❤❤  people like this woman are angels❤
This makes me smile!!
The owner needs some training, and then the dogs. What a terrible owner.
I wish I could put some spacers in the wheels so they don’t wobble…  I’d love to see how fast he goes with a speed radar…little man zooming!
Life is still filled with joy for this dog💞
Zlatí lidé a šťastný pejsek ,očividně mu nožky nechybí  i tak je šťastný ❤❤
LOVE THIS. THEY'RE BOTH BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS   AND PROPS TO YOU MOM, FOR CARING AND FINDING A WAY. BLESSINGS TO YOUR FAMILY ❤❤❤❤❤😅😅😅.
Love how the neighbors get out of the way for them with huge smiles on their faces.
You are a blessing to this furbaby
that is so sweet...
He's so happy ❤
How completely adorable!!!! Great loving parents!
The Best furr babys in the world!! I was taken back with how easy it was to put the wheels on. That's great.❤
Aw baby
Bless his little heart!! Not many dog owners are loving enough to wheelchair their pups!! She is a wonderful person! And to be showing this to the world is doing a great thing for people with disabled pets. Showing us all that just because your precious pup can't walk does not mean it should be discarded!!
❤
Awe, what a toughy!
❤ 🐶 ♥️
WALK...and away he goes....I want to break free 🎶 🎵
🙏✝️🙏  Love it, the 2 of them out for a run!  💞
Bless you for giving  them the best they  deserve  , love you ❤❤❤❤
Beautiful baby 🙏 👶 😍 💕 💖
❤
I look in the face of a pup (or baby) and see God.  Thank you for caring for this pup, look how happy!
Ayakları yere sürtüyo parçalanır !!!!!
❤😂😅❤❤❤
Hes dragging his toes on the floor that will get infected if its makes a wound , i think they make little boots or socks for dogs in wheelchairs
Sweet!
No leash on either dog...makes you wonder how he lost the use of his legs...car,maybe?🤔
love Love LOVE💯
I love him!!!
That's absolutely amazing to see how you get the one ready with the walker. You are a awesome mom. I see to how much love you show towards both dogs. The thing is he doesn't realize that he's a disabled dog. He definitely knows love and I'm very happy for him. Mom may God continue his Blessings in your life and all you do.  🙏🙏🙏💕💖❤️😍
😊😊❤❤❤God Bless you and your family 🎉🎉❤❤,
Ok so even if the dog is disabled it looks like it's rubbing it's but on the carpet
Посмотрите сколько радости у этой собачки,как она радуется жизни,у этой женщины очень доброе сердце 💓 Я очень бы хотел чтобы нашу планету в основном наполняли только такие люди.Чтобы не было войн,и всего остального не осмысленного беспредел а.
Aww
Did anyone notice that the dog is without a leash running on the street
Love it ❤
I love it! But it looks like he’s dragging his feet on the sidewalk.
Amen❤❤❤❤
❤😊 beautiful and awesome efforts.... godbless your family dear lady .... in more ways than many .... ❤ n regards
Nice...bt make  sure her toes dont touch the  ground ❤
I thought the disabled dog was doing the butt scoot across the carpet at first 😂❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So wonderful
Your REWARD is in HEAVEN❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Gracias ❤
❤
Love it ❤
Get an extendable leash
❤❤❤❤❤❤
They are both beautiful, But I would be so anxious letting either one of them run next to a road like that. But you gotta do what you gotta do if you don't have a big backyard. Plus it's probably easy for the adorable baby with the wheels.❤
❤🐕🐕🐕❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Merci ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sweet babies! Love that so much!!!99999999999999
Beautiful baby's 🙏 ❤😂❤
After watching 100 times😅(jk) I was so grateful to the person that invented the “round legs” I bet the dog was more grateful than I was!!
😔que felicidad la de ese hermoso perrito cuando le ponen sus rueditas que Dios Bendiga a esta gente que lo quiere NO los maltraten
❤
Brava tutts la mia ammirazione
Video of the year
Very sweet dogs! I know you didn't ask for my opinion but just takes once for them to run out in the road and you unable to get there in time. Just a thought......
Well the one dog does have his leash although he's carrying it.
Both fur babies show love & respect  towards each other.....as people, we could learn from this....just saying
His one foot seems like it doesn't work as well and catches the cement, it doesn't scrape his foot does it?
Omg,,,, he’s just as normal as can be,,,, just no back working legs!!!!  You’ve given him a life to love. ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Nothing like a dog excited to go for "walkies AND wheelies" at the same time. Beautiful to see... big treats all around especially mum❤❤❤
Incredible how happy he/she is.  😍😎
Hell ya!
❤❤❤❤Piękne,urocze Pieski. Fantastycznie ,że Piesek ma wózeczek na tylne łapki. Widać że są zadbane i ta młoda Pani bardzo Kocha te Pieseczki❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Necə sevinir gözəllik
I should  of said your Dogs are so Adorable 🥰 🥰 🥰
Fabulous
Your Dog is so Adorable 🥰 🥰 🥰
Yooo why he walking/himself tho buddy got the leash in his mouth😂😂😂😂😂ran took off both gone off  down the street
That’s awesome! Brightened my day.
It sucks that wheelchairs need to exist in a perfect world they wouldn't be needed, but it's beautiful that you take care of her!
MESKINE😢😢😢 MAGNIFIQUE😍😍😍
❤❤❤🙏
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I can't stop watching this!!!!!! 🥰🐕❤✌️
Your one of so many doggie best mommy keep everything your bwabies❤
That is crazy beautiful to watch.❤❤❤
Use winter boots to protect his back feet
that's beautiful....that's some happy dogs!!!  hope them wheels ate on there good...he s haulin ass
Maybe this is why the dog needs a wheelchair?  Running into traffic?  This woman is putting her dogs in danger…
I smiled and I don't  do that
She drifted into the gate almost 😂
Dallas Texas You'll job's a beautiful family and fury baby's. Tinkerbell and sassy said.  Appreciate
Well I definitely wasn’t expecting to see a dog move like that at first I thought OMG that’s hilarious and so cute 😂then I realized oh no the poor puppy can’t walk   What happened to her or hm
Can i just say thank you for being an awesome human being.
Ty our A wonderful Pet Momma!!😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Precious Babies!!!😙😙😙😙💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Beautiful  dog !
Zoomies!
This is wonderful to give this beautiful dog a chance at life, but I really think they need to stay on a leash
Where there’s a *wheel*, there’s a way! ❤️
Si vous pouvez montrez comment est composée la poussette du chien, cela pourrait aider des propriétaires. Merci de l'avoir fait pour votre chien. Le plaisir de la promenade est présent.. Il est heureux. Nous sommes heureux pour lui. ❤
The way that doggo took off after the wheelies were on was great!
Imagine all the carpet stains😅
Love love love
Bless u for being good to him❤❤❤❤❤
leash them?????
Awesome ❤🎉
walk times for dogs are the most exciting and enriching part of their lives :) they deserve all the walks
Ahh so beautiful
What a wonderful video you are amazing for helping her have an amazing time she is full of joy and i hope GOD fills you with eternal blessings ❤
Happy , happy dog, just a happy, happy dog 🐕🐕🐕😂😂❤❤❤
Magnifique merci pour lui ❤️💕❤️💕🦴🦴🦴🦴
Sweet baby🎉!
"Ain't nothin stoppin me! WOOT!"  LOL
So lovely omg sweet sweet baby!!
🥰
This is the sweetest thing I've seen in a while God bless you lady who cares for him your an amazing human
Live it made my day god bless
Hi doggie, keep enjoy, my 14 dogs, i dont wanna seevthem, a paralyzed, my heart, cuts like a knife, keep stong baby❤❤❤
Why do you have leashes of you aren't going to use them
Aww
I luv them
Hermoso te adoro por como lo cuidas ❤❤❤❤❤
I think he needs some boots on his back legs for when they drag the ground
You are so kind to those doggies. Love to all ❤🎉😊
I love how happy the both of the dogs are
Who else thought the dog was scooching his booty because he had worms? ✋️😊😊😊 oops!
I didn't read that it was wheelchair assisted and i thought it was just scooting its butt on the floor👁👄👁💀
we all thought he was rubbing his bum on the carpet 😂
I have the same wheelchair for my shepherd husky! He’s the sweetest boy ever he’s rescued from a dog fighting ring. He was a bait dog. Despite how big he is and he means he looks he didn’t have it in him to hurt another creature. He turned 13 in November, he’s losing use of his hind legs, but still wants to play and run, the whole nine! I’m so glad I bought him his wheelchair!❤
So beautiful 😍😍, thank you for caring for these beauties. Also; they way the cookies and cream pup snatch the leash😂😂😂.
The joy in this doggy gives me joy to watch him being cared so well by yourselves.  Be blessed in all.
Da sieht man die Freude die er hat denn jetzt kann er laufen.❤lichen Dank das du ihm hilfst❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
They are so adorable  and happy.....but leashes? Please? Some of us freak out when an unleashed dog runs up and my dog (on a leash) will attack.....i dobt want that, and neither do you.
God bless you God bless you God bless you❤😂 a very happy dog
It's so nice so excited it's beautiful
❤❤❤❤ May my Allah bless you always, may your life & home be full of blessings.❤
So beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So awesome ❤
I made such a small chuckle at the dog "walking" because at first i thought it was just doing that carpet scratch thing they do, but until i realized i wasnt laughing. Now with a person... That would be a different story, in a bad way
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Go Lassie gooooooo 😂😂😂
This is the sweetest and cutest thing I've ever seen.. you might want to get him a ramp because his chair might end up breaking by going down the steps..
As heartbreaking as it is that he lost the use of his hind legs, the fact that you were able to provide him with a properly fitting wheelchair and the fact that he is very happy and can run just as fast as he did before (or so it seems) is so great. Thank you for loving and caring for a special needs pet! I'm sure he knows what you're doing for him and will never forget it❤❤
Ale szczęśliwy piesek.
Your dogs are so well cared for and well trained.
God bless his soul
Hebis so happy

Excellent..

God wholesome, I love them. You might want to tighten the left wheel though, looked super floppy and loose. Might just be the nature of the device though.
THE CUTEST GOD DAMMM DOG IVE EVER SEEN❤❤❤❤
Was soll das?
Made me cry...  and smile at the same time.. I love dogs♥️
no leash?
❤❤
Dear baby jesus. Im so sorry🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ i thought this person was just letting their dogs wipe dingleberries all over their rug...
I thought he was just dragging his butt at first.
I'm also excited 💥💞
Aww😭😭😭
They are so adorable 😊😊😊😊
Tooooooii cute🥹
❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊
How do dogs with wheelchairs do their business? We own a GS and we're seeing some signs.. And we're afraid that she'll be needing one in the near future. So I'm just curious. If anyone would be so nice as to explain it, thank you ❤
Seeing a furbaby so happy is so good for my mental health. Too many are abused or mistrested by their human. Thank you for loving your furbabies as we all must!
Thank you God🙏🏻
❤❤❤❤ many blessings
Oh my God look at my face I couldn’t believe he was scooting on the floor what is up with that😂
❤❤❤❤
God bless you for giving those dogs so much love & affection...They are so precious..❤

❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best part of my day seeing this❤
What an inspiration to all the other 2-legged creatures in the world!❤
so off leash next to a road, i wonder how the dog lost its legs
Dog's got worms
You hire a dog walker, you're beautiful babies have a lot of energy! It is super inexpensive!
Respect to those who helped invented pet wheel chairs and those who adopt handicap dogs❤
This makes mu heart warm to see this dog who is unable to have are the bodily function a normal do would have but atill have the ability to do stuff like this
❤❤❤
A lot to learn from those two angels. A lot.
All dogs feel the same way ~ selfish lazy/overworked guardians lack proper time n attention 2 details about most they claim 2 care most about eh!?!!3:33Am2/20/2024
I needed to see this this morning how cute is that!
So sweet of you sister  you carrying this dog ❤️❤️
Great pooches and obviously loved. Why not put the leash on before you leave the house though?
Precious!!!💞🦴🦴🦴
That is really 👍!
Awesome❤😊
Should lift the back legs off the floor in the support they seem to be hitting the floor
道路に飛び出したらどうするの・・・😫
That is the most endearing video I have seen sooooo kind for helping disabled dogs with these gadgets absolutely amazing ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thsnk you 😢❤. You are one best kind heart human still giving hope to this lovely dog and you never give up and patience with them a lot. Thank you
"que bonitoooooooo" que feliz se ve' , gracias a las personas que hacen feliz a los animalitos ❤❤ Tenerife
The cutest🥰🥰🥰
Лучшее видео за этот день. Дай бог удачи и здоровья этим людям и собачкам
It's cute but you shouldn't have them unleashed. Very irresponsible for the dogs and other peoples safety.
Allah bless  your heart for taking such good care of Gods creatures.❤❤❤
So happy. ❤❤❤
Every life is precious. Thank you for loving puppy. ❤❤❤
Ahh bless...love them!! ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That's sooo sad😢😢😢😢
Your a beautiful person for loving and caring this disabled lovely dog Bless you🙏👍🇭🇲❤️
YOUR SO WONDERFUL WITH THESE BABIES!! I WAS TAUGHT TO NEVER LET YOUR DOGS GO THROUGH THE DOORS FIRST. SOME TIME,S THEY COULD RUN INTO SOMETHING DANGEROUS BEFORE YOU CAN SEE WHATS GOING ON OUT THERE. SOME GO IN THE ROAD FOR EXAMPLE. MY FRIEND,S DOG JUST DIED THAT WAY. SO SAD!.
All the excitement set aside...I bet there is a leash law. That is rather dangerous way to "walk" your dogs.
Dog had just watched "Ben-Hur" on TV 😄
Now that's a true dog owner. ❤
This is awesome... thank you!
Fantastic
Maybe put them on a Leash they see a Cat or another Dog or a Tractor they could run right in that Road.
Maybe its just me overly-concerned but what about his back right leg kinda scraping? Maybe a strap to hold it up idk 👍
Must feel so wonderful  to be able to run so fast!!!
Dog are amazingly adapted they don’t think about what they can’t do do there focus on what they still can.
😂😂❤❤❤❤
Хорошие, красивые собачки,спасибо вам большое,за заботу хвостиков❤️
Absolute joy on his face. Thank you so much.
Такая милота 😍😍😍  так побегать хочет ❤
Ya..Allhku..trimksh.. SESEORG YG BAIK SUDAH MEMELIHA..DOGI2NYA DGN BAIK❤❤

HAHAHAHAHAHA after u strapped he disappeared off camera haha
MARVELOUS 👍🥰🥰
VERY GOOD EXCERCISE !❤❤❤❤
Amoreeeeee🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠
❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊!!!!
Why even have a leash
So sweet of you to care to take care of him. He is so happy and so loved. Bless you.❤
Bless so sweet❤
It takes special people to care for handycap people and special people to care for handycap animals how adorable and sweet I absolutely love dogs I love my girls dearly ❤
Off leash by the road is crazy
🥰🐕🐕🫶🤗🫰❤️👏👍✨
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
They are not playing.
So cute.  He doesn’t have any idea he’s handicapped.
Tighten the wheels up a bit their it'll help the pup keep a straight line with no wobble washers always work as spacers 😊
Wow 👏.  You're an amazing human being ❤. There's a scripture that says, "The righteous takes care of his domestics. May God bless you 🙏❤..
God blessed all Selfless and good heart people ❤
Amazing and beautiful!!!!! I love your dogs . They can do everything with gusto!!!!!! Thank you for sharing your fantastic story. You have a great heart.
So adorable! God bless them!  ❤️😘🐕🐕🐾
You are the kind of person who really deserves to own a pet
the way he she scoooted off lol ❤
This is pure magic❤
Dogs see only the upside! So wonderful!
I must have watched this a thousand times and it’s still so adorable.thanks for sharing
He is so happy
People like this young woman truly are heroes  God bless her and her amazing animals and family ❤️🙏
❤❤❤
😁🥲
Just love those happy little faces❤
Maaf bang ini kalo download langsung dari situs HP nya ga bisa ya utk windows 10?
That’s sooo cool❤❤
Love that face. The excitement.  The happy run. Lovely pups❤❤❤
I love how the dog in the wheelchair is just like "yeeey go run!" 😄
Sooo Adorable and Awesome ❤😂
I love it/you !Way to go. A true animal lover
Very inspiring to see the pup run. Dogs are incredibly versatile creatures... they'll keep going if they can no matter what.   That looks like a really busy set of roads though...I do hope they're super well-trained not to go out into them off-leash or this video could have a much worse message to share.
The dog with the wheelchair is feeling “I’m a whole dog!”
Dogs are so resillient It's amazing
Oh myyyy hearrrrrt!!!!. What cute fur babies you got!! Sending love and light!!!
Так выглядит Счастье!!!
What an absolute trooper and such a great lady not giving up on such a beautiful dog. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I miss my Rudy. I wish I had been well enough to have gotten him wheels when he broke his back after I was recently home from severe back surgery.  I miss him. I should have just done it.
Fantastic.  Two very happy pups.
God bless him. He was so happy to be able to run like the other dog.
Bellos❤
This dog is having a happier life then myself, cared for better then me. Ok, can't complain, still can walk without help. 😢😭
That's just so beautiful 🎉!
You may want to strap the back legs up.
Oh wow, this brought a tear to my eye, thank god you’re in that doggies life! Bless you and your beautiful pups 🩵
Thats a go getter pup 😊
❤❤
That's so awesome she can run again❤
This dog's happiness alone can get you to heaven ❤
Alright, usually I laugh and make fun at stuff like this, but this was so warming and just so fuzzy in my heart haha ❤ just a bebe
She was so excited ❤
Wow... hes loving the freedome go run and move again... BRILLIANT
How does a rear paralyzed dog potty?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg adorable overload. I love that pup
🥰🥰🥰
It's the leap off the step for me 😂😂 ❤❤❤❤ what a couple of cutie pies ❤
The cuteness! The floor but scoots!! The excitement!!!I CANT!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
А никто не заметил, какой милый мимо проходящий мужчина, как он улыбается, видя этих собак?))😊 В нашем краснодарском крае почему-то очень многие ненавидят собак и только желчью плюются в их сторону, особенно если собака без поводка и намордника 😢
Ah, I see you also have a PURPLE LEASH OF POWER. The force is great in that one.
Dogs are courageous without knowing it.
Man dogs they just oooooohhhh bless you all
Your great for helping this precious doggie
Thanks for sharing this happy moment, but you're on a busy street and you aren't in control if your dogs, hopefully they won't dash across the street and get hit by cars or even someone pulling into their driveway !!!. Wait till you get to the park ❤.
Yes! Thank you to the people that make  those doggie’s wheelchairs possible!!!❤❤❤
Omg so adorable!!!
👍 Yes Bravo The wheelchairs are magnificent. Our fur babies get a second chance to run and play 🥰
God bless you dog parents and our lovely Dogs. ❤
You made my day❤😊
I would sue the crap out of her for letting dogs run wild like that. IRRESPONSIBLE DOLT!
This is the most heartwarming, exciting ,fun cutest video I've ever seen . I hope they wait at the stop sign, or traffic light? Adorable! Lots of love. Owner you are a blessing to them both as they are to you?
машаAллах  Спасибо что помогли ему  это требует столько терпения и понимания
❤❤❤
I love him but he has a wobbly wheel, please tighten ❤❤❤❤❤
❤😂 lovely Engel dogs 🙏🐶🐕
Cute baby ❤❤❤❤❤

What a bundle of love and energy !
This warmed my heart so much i think caused heart burn ❤🔥 seriously tho its beautiful 😍
You are the perfect owner for this dog!🥰🙏🏻🙌🏻🫶🏻🌷
They are so cute but just check the wheels on you're puppy. They look kind of loose at least the left one does
Shouldn't you strap his back legs up so they don't get hurt and raw bring dragged along.
Uh oh...Im bout to burst in tears.😢
Thank you sweet person. Such a good heart for our furry pals❤
How sweet!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💜lovey little souls, you too Doll.

SOOOOOO AWESOME ❤
Oh i'm so glad i saw this in the morning ......... just made my day 🥺 so happy to see you people taking good care of animals . God bless you beautiful hearted lady and your beautiful doggos❤❤❤❤
So precious 💕💕
Love this❤❤
Just a thought:  Perhaps you should consider “rebuilding” that second step going out of your house! It looks a bit too high for the wheelchair! This could cause some issues with it later on!  I walk around with a cane outside (I have trouble with stairs, standing and walking long distances, a fragile left foot due to a previous injury and I’m scared to fall on the poorly maintained sidewalks around my neighbourhood, as well on ice and snow!)  I wouldn’t feel comfortable trying to get into your place, unless there was some kind of handrail for me to use!
Gives me great pleasure to see this. Thanks for sharing.
That puppers can move with the wheels
The loving mom...you are amazing..... beautiful heart...his smile reflects that he's loved
❤
This made me so happy!
You are such a good mom to your pups. ❤❤❤❤
Great 👍
Your a great blessing 🙌 ❤
This is great. Do his feet have to drag?
this is so cute but the two unleashed dogs right next to a road makes me so nervous 😭
Omg how excited and happy that puppy is ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ thank you for taking care of him
A busy road like that, they should be on a leash.
He's awesome!!!!!!
So sweet. We don’t deserve puppies ❤
That is such a beautiful thing. You are doing for that dog makes me want to cry.
I could watch this over and over again ❤❤❤
WHAT A DOLL YOU ARE!! ❤ TAKING CARE OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL BABIES AND GETTING JUST AS EXCITED AS THEM WHEN YOU SAY "READY"? YOU ARE A ❤ OF GOLD
Adorable
Too cool 🎉😂 sweet doggies, good mama🎉
That one wheel 👁️👄👁️ 😂😂
❤🩷 Omg how precious is this. 🐾 🐾
That is wonderful!
GODBLESS HIM!!!!!
Thank you for taking care of him - looks so happy when you take them put side

Adorable!
Love that.
I have no words other than, simply precious 💕💕🥰💖💖
This made my day.❤️❤️❤️👑
Noooo Toby!! 😆 😉if you know They’re adorable!!!♥️
I want to meet the first person who invented the pet wheelchair!!!!  I even see them for cats!    The first person deserves an award nationwide!!
Looks like the wheels are kinda wobbly
Thank you for what you are doing for your pets

Gracias por ayudar a ése bello perrito a qué su vida no sea tan difícil,😢 qué Dios té bendiga buena mujer ojalá y no sé lastime sus patitas de atrás saludos!🙏👍🐕🐾❤
Both dogs are adorable. I guess I would be afraid the dog would get ahead of me into the street before I could stop them. Does the dog in the wheelchair ever have injuries on the rear legs?  I know they can’t feel back there and if they’re injured it can be serious serious
Adorable
Aww♥️♥️♥️
🙏❤️🙏
So Precious, pure love. God Bless you for giving him his best life!!❤❤❤
They are so beautiful 😢oh my heart ❤️
So happy! So loved & well cared for. Fills my heart, Thank you❤ (plz plz be careful, i see there's a grey driveway there. They would never see your previous angels running across behind the driveways.  Plz dont let them  go there without you being there to make sure  its safe for them to cross. (Ive seen it happen, twice. Devastating😢) Have to keep rewatching! Theyre sooo excited, soooo happy!!🤗😆
❤❤❤
So beautiful 😊
Love it
The rear needs to be lifted at least a half inch so it's paw doesn't drag.
You are such a innovative & ❤ handler👍
The wheels wobble. Hope the don’t come off
God bless you 🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤
You go go go puppy dog 😊❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤ZOOM!!!!💨♥️♥️♥️
Lift up the wheels so the dogs legs dont drag. Even if he or she cNt feel it, still lift. And tighten those back wheels. Youre so amazing
They are so happy to be going on a walk ❤
What great parents the dogs have nothing but the best
Precious 💕
You should get sum gloves/Morton’s or sum socks for his feet in the back
Two well loved dogs. The disabled one is beautiful as is its companion.
Your such a good Cobbie Mama , look how happy they are . Love it ❤
❤❤❤
His wheels are wobbly. Are they supposed to be that way? If not, can I donate to get him less wobbly ones?
If I could hit the LIKE button a million times , I could not be happier for you all!!!
Look at that sweet face1
So glad he has a wheelchair 2 get around. Good job ❤😂❤
Omg he sure can run fast.
That was so sweet, the dog is so adorable and happy.
BE CAREFUL NOT ON LEASE, I SAW A DOG SEE ANOTHER DOG ACRISS THE STREET AND RAN IN FRONT OF A CAR AND WAS KILLED..
Bless his heart, he's ready to go and let the other dog know that the handicap goes first ❤😂❤
So exciting to see such a beautiful  dog using his scooter 😍 ❤ 💗  look how happy he is ...
Beautiful, but you *must* keep your dogs under your control at all times off your property.
If you want to see a positive attitude toward life, watch a handicapped animal. I've never seen a cranky, or grumpy, handicapped animal. They have a lot, and i do mean a lot, to teach us about how to live life to the fullest.
Absolut wunderbar, wie glücklich der Hund ist .
Simply adorable
I have a great respect for someone who adopts or keeps a dog that has been paralyzed.  Thank for giving him a full life. They both are beautiful!!❤❤
😮how cool! Happy 🐕 are beautiful,.😊
I'd be worried they'd fart into the busy street.
I love how this fog gets so excited to go outside! Thank you for being so kindhearted with these furbabies! God bless you and these precious dogs! ❤❤
The other dog that just carries its leash 😁
Funny that the leash people aren’t talking in these comments idc put it on a leash
Aww 🥰 so precious ❤❤❤
Amazing 😄
Thank you so much, thank you❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤joyous❤❤
Is it me or the dogs are going for a jog??
Bless you, for giving the best life to your precious fur babes. You have a heart of gold.
❤
He bolted!!! The other dog was like, “Gimme that leash!!! I got this! Let’s gooo buddy, catch me if you can!!!”
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😅
This is so beautiful, bless their hearts 🥰 it's the simple things in life that mean the most!! 🙏
You truly are an amazing Mom to make a beautiful happy life for this precious baby!😊
I didn't read the title of this video. It just popped up when I opened YT and I thought it was just a dog doing butt scoots but I was happy to see how precious this video really was. This just made my day. Thank you.
Can't get better than this vid.  God bless your love.
That is so precious! What an angel! Thank you mom! ❤
Adorable baby
How sweet and cute.. innocent soul and lovely face and smile he has...may he will be blessed ever!
Precious❣️❣️❣️
❤❤❤❤
That is so sweet. Btw. How about getting a wheel alignment on they dog's wheel chair.
Love this, but they should be on leads.
Salute 2 u 4 helping  these precious pyppys❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🫶🏾🥹 so adorable
The left wheel on that chair needs to be tightened up a bit it's wobbly and might fall off
Beautiful 😊
Feel sorry for the dog but that was so adorbs.
I thought it had a itchy crack untill i noticed it was disabled 😂
😇😇😇❤❤❤Sie sind ein Engel und ich danke Ihnen herzlichst dafür, daß Sie diesem Hund das Leben schenken was er verdient. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Very fast 😄
Good thing i read the title as the pup was moving, other wise i woyld have thought he had a gruffnut.😅
Kudos to the "engineers" that designed that. Brilliant. And a full sprint too. 👍
I notice his feet dragging some.  Might booties or a little sling help protect him??  What about his elimination needs??  What uf he has to go at 11:30 pm???
I feel like his paw needs to be lifted away from the floor a bit
Cute😅😅😅
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You are doing awesome,keep up the good work and giving dogs their best life and home.🙏
Aww, this is so awesome!  Thanks for sharing 😊
Oh my heart 🥰🐾 Sooooooo happy!!!!!
youd think a crippled dog would make you be cautious of traffic
Oooh, love them❤️❤️❤️
God bless!!!
That's  so cute
God bless you Madam, love to you and your dogs
The wonderful world of kindness! ❤❤❤😊😊😊
❤❤❤❤❤
AWE!!
Maybe its me but I think they enjoy going out!
You are a very good person ❤❤❤
Amore bello ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That Is A Whole Lot Of ENERGY 😮
❤❤❤
When I 1st seen it I thought the dog was scratching his back door then realised he needed a chair to get along fair play to for looking after the dog 👏🏻👏🏻
That's a tad sad and beautiful at the same time. But my heart goes out to the spirit the little guy has. You've made his life worth living. And I think the world of your huge heart, making him so loved 💞🌹🐕
No wonder your dog is crippled, the way you let the run when there is traffic around is very irresponsible
What an amazing family, humans and dogs❤
Dogs are the best
God bless you! 🙂
I would love if I was walking down the side walk and saw those two puppers running g towards me.❤
The able-bodied dog should be on the leash; not running around with it 😒
So sweet!
🥰 Unconditional True Tender Loving Care ❤💯  Bless You All Loving Human Family 🙏😍 Champions 🏆
That is thé most beautiful thing I've watched Today. You are wonderful ❤
Please don't forget the dog leash.❤❤❤
Great video and thanks mate
💜
❤❤❤❤❤
At first I thought the dog was just cleaning His Bottom
Вы очень любящая хозяйка❤❤❤) Вашему хвостику повезло❤
So wonderful
Way cool  Can there be something made for his back feet to lift them up????
Beautiful..
Lady, if you are reading this. You're dogs are so very loved ❤
Bad dog owner
thought it was rubbing it‘s ass on the floor at first😭
Why is it so hard for abled bodied people to say “disabled”
Absolutely precious furbaby your beautiful ❤❤
Bless you for caring enough to purchase a wheelchair for your precious pup. More people should look into this life changer for their dogs. Why would you allow your dogs to run off leash and endanger their safety and well-being? That, as a dog parent, is so irresponsible -- even if you are only doing it for a video. There are people who will see this and think their dogs should be off leash as well. This is unfair to the dogs, and also unfair to people with dogs who don't like other dogs, and to people who are afraid of dogs.
Omg I'm crying!!! 😭😭😭 He's the cutest thing in the whole wide world
It gives me tears of joy for the dog
So rad! Go puppy go! 😢😊😊😊😊
What a wonderful life you give them ❤🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾👏👏👏
I like that he knows to straighten out his hind legs.
❤❤❤
Beautiful!
How do you keep them out of the street?
Wonderful 😘 thanks for your devotion
Dang this made me cry. I love my dogs so much and you are an angel for them. God bless!
Oh my goodness 😍 so darling 😂
Such a happy duo  , cheers up my day to see them , go go go pups
Videos like this makes me cry I love animals I have a puppy she is my grandpuppy. I can't imagine seeing my baby like that but to you you should be awarded because people like you take the time to care for animals who are injured or came from abuse families. that's a lot to deal with. I don't know you but I wanna say you are awesome
Beautiful ❤😊
Okay the leash part though 😂😂he's just gonna be carrying that leash 😂
Precious babies ❤❤❤❤❤
yeah, awesome, but pls leash!
❤❤❤
Absolutely the best Mom ever. Giving your little baby the opportunity to increase his/her quality of life, rather than discard this beauty is heart warming. To watch him jump off the porch and run to catch his sibling brought me a smile and tears of joy for him. His sibling is happy, being able to interact with his buddy has increased his quality of life too . Your a great Mom!❤😊😇💖💗💞❤🐾🍖🐕‍🦺🦮
Go Puppy!!!  He bounced down those step and rocketed away.
That's awesome 🎉🎉🎉🎉
That's TOO cute!! ❤❤❤❤ 🥰🥰
So precious!
I really think wheels for dogs are absolutely amazing, years ago alot of dogs with this problem were probably put to sleep as it was "kinder to them" rather than seeing them struggle but now they literally have a new lease of life 😊😊
Jesus love the dog🥰😘🙏😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
I would not be able to trust my dogs off the leash like that 😭
Love her ❤
So precious how excited he is and how patient and loving and caring and supportive u r bless u both in this life and with heaven Amen 🙏🏻 ❤❤
❤❤❤
Precious and heartfelt love 😊❤
У меня собака здоровая, но жопу об ковёр вытирает так же...😂
Do His Lil Back Paws hit the Pavement???
I had a friend who had a dog that took hold of his own leash every time they went out.  Its so adorable.  What youve done for your other dog with the wheels is so admiral.  I am really in awe.  Thank you for loving those two.
Wow They are Both Beautiful!! Your one Disabled Baby is a True Inspiration!! This was The Caauutteesstt!!🙏💙💙💪💪💪💪🙌✨💯💎🏅🏆🎗️😻😽😘💋🥰
When technology is used Right ✅️
Thats amazing as always. I think the back needs a little raise though to stop the back paws from dragging on the concrete. Not sure if someone else has said this yet bc I havent read any comments im sure someone has but yeah. Just a thought. Probably doesnt feel it anyway given the circumstance
❤👌🤝👍🙏🕉️☪️✝️🌺👏✋
Yeah no unless your dog has an amazing recall, do NOT let them off leash
They are both so cute!
As cute as this is, please leash your dog before leaving.
This is so precious 💕 one thing tho: dem wheels looked like they might just fall apart any second. Are they Very old? :/
What a sweetheart. ❤
U are awesome to help this dog
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Happy dog.. happy dog ...happy happy happy dog. Love it thanks😊
Love this! I commend you for wanting to preserve that dog’s quality of life.
Hahaha, she has her leash. Oh was I supposed to holding the other end? Hmm, I will work on that. lol
Smiles and hearts😊😊❤❤
Ohhh my god
🌹🌹🌹👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🦾🦾🦾
Я восхищение своё проявляю  людям которые занимаются больными животными❤Большое вам спасибо!
What are you thinking?  traffic? No control?  dead dogs alert
Leash ur freaking animals like other ppl have real service dogs and those mutts can run right up to them like idk anymore ppl like that will blame a pit bull on leash for biting their loose dogs for running right up to em
WHAT A GREAT PERSON AND BEAUTIFUL DOGS
GOD BLESS YOU,  BEAUTIFUL FUR BABIES ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
The daily dose of joy from this pup erases any doubt.
He is so cute thank God he has you
To cute love there excitement in the Dalmatians too much thinking that he's got a hold of the leash to him or something that's cute and love that he has a special Walker to walk in
Look like his tires loose you need to tighten it up
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh my gosh what an amazing lady,helping the gorgeous dog there's always a way ♥️💖❤️💝
I’m glad the dog is taken care of
Какое счастье, что у этой собаки есть такой прекрасный человек ❤
God bless you both ❤
❤❤❤
I think this is so cool
Poor dog but he is happy
Such pure joy on that babys face❤
❤
Precious! You’re so lucky that your dogs stay on the sidewalk!… if I had let my dogs run out without holding the leash, they would take off across the street aargh!
Aaaaasnd puppers is off!!! 😂
So sweet
❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is great!!! How sweet 😊
It’s good to see the dog enjoying life despite its disability. You are a caring person for giving him this opportunity when a lot of people would have put him to sleep. ❤❤❤
This and i say there is many but this pulls hard at my heart strings ,You are Amazing muma with 2 Amazing fur babies 🎉🎉❤is 🫠🎉❤🎉❤
Merveilleux ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So excited to be able to run! 💓
Is there a way to bring the back legs higher so they don’t drag? His little feeties 🥺
Aaaaaand outta there! 😂❤
Un animal te enseña  muchas cosas hermosas  y te enseña a vivir  contados sus problemas  de discapacidad  y el ser humano  se queja  por todo un animal te enseña  mucho loque el ser humano no aprende.
oh that beautiful fur baby
"I am speed!" They're both so adorable.
This makes me really happy! Both your dogs are lovely; at first I thought the golden was scooting, but the truth was so much more precious. Give me wings and I will fly!
What's her social media,  i NEED  to watch this daily it makes me smile so much bless them❤❤❤❤❤
That's just wonderful!!! ❤❤❤
Don't get a blowout going that fast. 😂
How happy and beautiful!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤😊
❤
Tears.   Sigh.
Send his back feet not touch the ground or maybe he should wear a special slippers or something but I'm so glad that he has that and he can get around and he can run he's going to have a really good quality life he's probably going to live 7 to 10 years longer now then he would have if he didn't have his little buggy so thank you for giving him his little buggy and all the people that invented these things for animals so much nicer and so much more
Ohh, I haven't seen Superscooty for a while, she's just as happy as ever! So lovely to see the happiest puppy ever thrive! Thank you, for giving them the best lifes❤❤❤
The tan dog is with the perfect owner. 🙏👍
How absolutely gorgeous to see such  excited dogs and look at them running ❤
Permanent Hunde kot auf dem Teppich 😂
Aw  beautiful still has his freedom to enjoy life ❤❤
How much happier could they be?! I think they have passed complete happiness on are on their way to to paying it forward to everyone who sees it and helps give another a chance at pure joy. ❤
keep them off lead running ahead of you and the other one will end up in a wheelchair too
I have no words other than absolutely beautiful he looks so happy when he’s going for a walk with mama. Well done mam for what you do for your fur babies 🧸🫶🐶🙏💩🐕🐾🦴🌎☺️
Love Love🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️♥️♥️😘🐶😘🐶
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
There's probably doo-doo streaks all over that carpet. Lol
Good doggy’s 😭😭😭😭😭😭🤚🤚🤚
Questa è  gente che ama gli animali! Commovente...❤😢
He can't do what???? 😂😂❤❤❤❤
That baby is so thankful to be able to run! So sweet. 😊
❤AWW THAT'S SO PRECIOUS, BUBBA ANGEL'S 😇 😇 WAITING TO GO WALKIES ❤
❤❤❤  Just my Bandit.  He got struck by an SUV and as a result, broke his back. He never lost his love for running freely!  We bought him a carriage, much like yours. Even without the use of his hind legs outran his siblings.   Thank you for posting this!❤❤❤
I thot omG he has worm s then I saw the excitem ent and the wheelchair I thot OOO u little bugger ur an adorable fur baby. U need 💋 n 💋  n 💋 😘 😗 😚 😙 💏 💋 😊
That's really sweet. He's so happy.
Enjoy ur afternoon, guys😂
That made me cry. You are amazing ❤
What a cutie.❤ wouldn't a wider belly   padded area be better softer  so he isn't pinched? Foot booties? What a sweetie aww you can hear the joy they bring you too.
Aww I love this 😢😊❤❤❤❤
😍
Beautiful video.❤
Thats a lot of happiness 🤗
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉
❤
❤❤❤❤🥰🤲🙏
They look so happy, thank you for loving them both…🐕🐕🐾🐾🐾🫶🐾❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤
Ooooo..those little jumps off the stairs scared me 😭
The dog grabbed the leash and was like i got it lets GO !!😂😂
Love the enthusiasm of the w/c pup. Plz make sure his toes stay off of the ground. Most people would put a dog down if it was unable to walk anymore. I myself am in a wheelchair and have been since I was 36 and I’m 62 now. I’m happy my husband didn’t give up on me. Thank you so much for loving and caring for your furry family members. The joy that they have on their walks says it all. Thanks for sharing them with us. ❤️❤️✌🏻
C'est beau de le voir si heureux ❤❤❤
That’s awesome, so cute. She needs to tighten those wheels though before they fall off. They probably became loose because they’re not designed for off-roading and jumping stairs like this dog is doing lol
Precious!!! Thank you!
❤
How come the dog can’t have the wheelchair at home. Like why not let your dog be able to be a normal dog all day. Instead of just for walks. Just curious. Not bashing you. Just wondered why.
I commend you for taking such good care of your dogs, but please leash them once out on the street, for the sake of the pedestrians who may be walking their own dogs, and for yours. I lost a beloved dog by walking them unleashed.
Sorry. Leash. Leash. Leash. That dog would KILL my wife. A walking frame and she would go down, never getting back up.  Sorry th3 dog is disabled.  I am even more sorry my wife 😮is so frail. I deal with mine.  Please deal with yours.
SO PRECIOUS. BOTH OF THEM
There aren't leash laws?
Thank you for your Beautiful Kind Heart 😢😢 Gods Blessings To You Always 🫂🕊️🕊️🕊️👍👍👍🦮🦮🌹❤️
Great
I hate when people dont leash their dogs
I love this
That’s so cool
Those are very happy looking pups!! All good dogs love their walkies
Does his little feetsies get scraped at all!! He's having' too much fun!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love this video! It just warms my heart! I love how much humans can change the life of an animal. We can make their life better. And it's the most beautiful thing in the world
That's so wonderful thank you for giving the fur baby a great life
Aww so sweet!!! They made me LOL I could watch them race all day!!! 💓💓💓

Love his heart for such a special pupper Mommy taking care of his needs and allowing him to run and play!! You are a real Angel!! 🩷🐾🙏🏽😇

I am so sorry, your dog is still cute, but I thought it was scraping its bum on the carpet. Still very cute
This brought tears to my eyes. To see the happiness in doggy once the wheels went on was priceless, and god bless the owner for twking care of it
How wonderful!!!

❤🌸🥰👌
Awe they are precious ❤❤❤❤❤
So darn cute 🥰
It's nice they don't run off or go into the road, but it might be best to leash them, just in case they come in contact with another animal.
❤❤❤
If there's a handicap doggy race, he will definitely win!❤
❤ I love seeing that! Thank you! For giving them the care& love they deserve.. Keep being you!! ❤❤❤❤

YouTube audience: how cute Pedestrians: why do I have to dodge your unleashed dogs? Drivers: I didn’t see the dog until it was too late
This is dangerous.  I  saw dog being  hit by a by a backing up car. You have to keep tour animals safe !
Ich würde die Hinterbeine noch arretieren, damit er sicherer läuft und sich nicht verletzen kann 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😜😜😜‼️‼️‼️
You should put little mittons or something on his back paws so they dont get hurt being dragged on the concrete ❤
I’m so happy for him!!!
That's one for the books! The baby is scooting because she has a Poop!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg grab the leash wtf are you doing letting them run around. They could be hit by a car

May God Bless you
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Another accident if you don’t put the leash 😡
Beautiful People
Awesome ❤.
Gracias por darle tanto amor🙏❤️💕💕💕
So I guess you can just let your dogs go running around the neighborhood without a leash.  I always keep my dog on a leash out of respect for other people, but this is California after all.
Love you❤
When good owner and good person go hand in hand! 😊
Hahahahahaha i love their energy. What little loves!!
Cutee❤
Oh my heart
Lady, you are an angel, a true angel, for the way you treat your animals. I am sure that they don't see you as their BOSS or something but as A DEAR FRIEND AND FAMILY!!
Respect u and love them. They r so precious
The world needs a lot more people like you
Your baby are so adorable just wanted to hugs them.❤
Bless that dog. Nothing is stopping it get outdoors, its a shame some people aren't like that 😂😂😂😂
❤
The left wheel needs attention. Wobbles. 😮😊. Beautiful dogs.  Wonderful you. 💜💜💜
🙏💕🙏💕🙏💕🙏💕🙏💕🙏💕🙏💕🙏💕🙏💕🙏
Does she want to get her dog hit by a car? Not even amusing.
Glad you're doing the extra work to keep her. She looks happy
I know they’re excited but, I hope those pups stop before crossing the street 😬
Que bonito,  le encanta correr!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Jesus!!!! I love you so much and all of your creations!!!!! 💐✨😝
What a beautiful dog and the running made me smile ❤
God Bless
So darn cute
Thats adorable, even if at first i thought it was dragging its ass because of an itch. Still, what a cute dog
❤❤❤
Bless his free lil heart🥹💕
👍👍👍Be still my ❤️! XOXO
Oh how beautiful is that! Do you find that your dog that's in the wheelchair assistant ..do you find that his back legs/feet scrape on the ground at all? (his paws rather) Lol...
❤❤❤you  love them s ok much All respect to you, they have good life with you
You're an Earth Angel! 😇❤
That made my heart ache they are so happy
How dangerous to let the dogs in that busy street . They will be hit one day by a car
The zoom off screen after she clicks him in 🥲
😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful 😂❤
It's cute and of course heart warming but also a liiiitle reckless.
So wonderful! Great lesson showing how we need to live the best life we can live no matter what the challenges
So adorable
I don't think that dog could be happier even if  it ad all 4 legs working. Dogs like look at me I'm soooo cool 😂
Precious moments tor everyone ❤
That made me tear up. Thank you 🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
It's great you help dog with wheel chair etc. But WHY are you letting them run wild down  the sidewalk beside a BUSY STREET...what's your solution when something unexpectedly distracts them and they run into traffic chasing it? Seems dangerous to me. Am I missing something here???
Before my dog passed we got him a wheelchair for hos final moments, I highly recommend Eddie's wheels over in Massachusetts if your new England!
❤🎉❤🎉❤
PLEASE HAVE A BIKE REPAIR SHOP ADJUST THE PLAY ON THE WHEELS
Oh my God. ❤
She is so happy
Super ❤❤
Oh that is truly wonderful, so happy, ❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
Ive got pink toe just watching this!
The chair dance - ours doesn’t wait for the chair - he is out the door and on the grass!
❤🙏🏻🌹😇🐾
❤😂❤ BEAUTIFUL ❤😂❤
❤🙏🐶

Simply beautiful!!!  I love this video
The rear legs need to be supported to avoid injury to the rear paws.
He was out I'm happy he can enjoy outside as well❤❤❤..
The joy of being able to run. 💚
God bless you for not giving up on your family
"Let me just wipe my ass before we go"
What a champ!💪🏼🤙🏼👏🏼
❤
He's so fast at running when he's excited!
My heart  💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘👀
Beautiful  love you have 💙💙💙💙💙💙👀💘💘💘💘💘💘💜💓💗💗💖💖💕💕💕💕💕💕💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Bless her. Making a dog's life more enjoyable, even for a few minutes, will mean the world to them!
Здорово спасибо большое счастье ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Im guessing by the way you let your dogs run uncontrolled out in public that it needs the wheels because it was hit by a car?
Such a good dog mommy!! He is a truly happy boy❤❤❤🐾
May God bless your heart ma'am. It touches my heart how yu love him till the end😢
Left wheel looked a little loose or just me?? But such excited doggos
I have a tripaw, always try to give her the best life I'm glad you do too.
❤
He is so cool❤👍👏👏❤️
Bless him ❤
So happy😊😊
❤ Thank you for the care.
❤❤❤❤❤ooo🦮🦮🤎🤎
I can tell you love your dog dearly but what if a car was backing out of a driveway and had just completed their head-check when he suddenly ran behind them as they backed up?  Wouldn't it be safer to put the wheels on at the local school track?
This is amazing and heart-warming but somebody please get him a sturdier rig with some sort of brakes, tighter bolts, a place to rest his rear legs, and wheels that pivot.
😂😂😂😂😂 heureux ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Greatest thing to see ever he is just beside himself with pure joy to be able to once again run free like he was meant to be just brings a smile to the lips and tears to the eyes
😍
At first I was like you letting your dog booty scoot by the way when I say at first I mean I did not see that he was in a wheelchair
Go!Go!Go! Got a life to live and a lot of love to give! Go precious,Go!❤❤❤
Get them on a leash, goddamn irresponsible
Why do you just let them run off leash
God bless you for giving this dog a good life.we
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Teaching us if you can find a way to do your desires there’s no need to worried what you look like; just enjoy!
She took OFFFFF
This is the xutest damn this ever
Wow how beautiful this dog gets when he is going out. ❤
I just love both those babies..so sweet..you are a wonderful dog Mom❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So sweet 💕
This video has warmed my heart so much today. What joy. Thank you for doing this for this beautiful doggie. I love the way the healthy dog is given his lead to very as something of his own too.
❤❤❤😊
Bravaaaaaaaaa
The way his wheels bang off the steps bc hes going so so fast!! Aww ,how cute. He wants everyone to see he can still go fast!!!❤❤❤ Glad thry have u and rach other!
Pure joy 😂❤😊
😢
Just precious!!! God's true innocent creatures ❤❤❤❤
You want to do something about those wheels
Booties for back paws😢 ? Road burn?
I love it!❤❤❤❤❤❤
He needs some boots to protect the back feet
So exciting.  The legs dragging and bumping on the ground should they have something protecting them.  I'm just asking.  It is a great joy to watch this babies happiness to go outside. Loved it
That makes me delighted to see them so happy.. they are gorgeous ❤
I was excited too! Bless you both. ❤❤
They were both so excited and very, very happy!  She’s such a good mom. 😍
How terrific !😊
Love how the other dog holds its leash in its mouth 😅.
God bless him❤
He is so excited. Just makes me so happy to watch this.thank u
Please  lift his back legs, they are scraping on the ground.😢
Love the dogs being so excited to go outside- but what, exactly, is the point of putting the other dog on a leash that is just dragging behind him- and forcing the pedestrians to get out of the dog’s way as he races down the sidewalk?
My whole world falls apart a little when I see injured animals 😭
amazing really, but kind of sad going outside means walking on pavement and concrete
Keep your damn dogs on a leash please!!!! You are on a busy road. Be more responsible.
I hope they have a leash law. 😅 cuz otherwise, terrifying~ for both the dogs and humans.
Cutest thing on the internet today ❤
God bless ❤❤❤❤❤
Sweet
Good on you this is heart warming ❤
They made my day 🔥❤️
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
❤😊
Over time them steps will brake his wheels ask can someone put a ramp in for him am sure someone on here will do it for free
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Awe, they're both so sweet! You're a wonderful fur, baby mom. Bless you for your kindness and compassion ❤
👏👏👌👍🏻
So precious.  I'm worried about his back feet dragging though....
Beautiful ❤
Thank-you for looking after this amazing pup and giving him/her their best life. 👍😁❤️❤️❤️
That's Awesome ❤❤
Thank you
Wow 😲 very fast good job both so cute 🥰
That dog is so happy. Whoever invented that. I love them for it you made that dog's day❤❤❤❤❤
Absolutely precious! I love how that one pup takes his own self out for a walk lol
God bless you for taking such good care of this wonderfully spirited pup.!
No matter what they love their walks.Just love  their faces.
You need little booties for his back paws when they drag with scuff pads!
❤❤❤
This is so perfect! Pure love from mom to dog. Love it!
That's awesome i love people who care that much about animals.
OMG!!! The cutest baby ever. God forgive me, but I swear I literally LOVE FURBABIES MORE THAN HUMANS ❤❤❤❤
So beautiful. You are an angel, both pups and mom! 😀😀
They are so adorable 🥰
Very happy❤❤❤❤
How fantastic 😂😂❤❤❤
I love EVERYTHING about this video. That dog hasn't slowed down. I loved seeing how fast it ran.
I had a chihuahua that needed a wheel chair when he was almost 16😢 put him down feb 10th of last year.  Miss him so much. 💔
What incredibly awesome wheelchair! During my 18 year old Husky Snickers, what ending up being, the last 2 weeks of his life, he lost the strength in his back legs. The vet didn’t have much he was able to do for us sadly (just because your dog is old doesn’t mean that they’re getting ready to die if they have a sudden change in health - you should definitely take your dog to the vet and see if there’s something that can be done - Snickers did have a mild bladder infection which antibiotics did seem to help with his mobility. It would have been a godsend to both my dog and myself to have been able to have a wheelchair to help. I used 2 excellent harnesses to help support his back weight plus help with mobility but at a cost to my bad joints. But I’d have done anything to help my best guy Snickers!
That dog is so sweet
Wow! So sweet
You are a kind person
God Bless You.
Love ur compassion for those beautiful souls ❤
That happy face is everything 💜
Heartwarming ❤
Her feet need to be propped up so they don’t dangle like that. They can get scraped on the ground as she runs and she can’t feel anything so she wouldn’t be able to feel if she’s hurting. Usually hose wheelchairs have little straps to prevent the feet from dangling
The Best Invention.
❤❤❤❤❤❤ 😍🥰😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Very cute and wonderful that you’ve been able to help that  pup!! But, your other dog is gonna end up that way getting hit by a car letting them run loose on a sidewalk next to the street like that ! Go to a park if you don’t have a yard to run in.
💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝🙏💝🙏🙏🙏🙏💝💝💝💝💝💝💝🙏
😞🥺😥😢😭
So adorable!❤😂
These are so special, love the people who thought of the wheels, yeahhhhh!!!❤❤
Omg...❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So precious.
Taking time out of your life to help another that cannot help himself is very beautiful. Blessings come to people like you! ❤🕊️
Aww dogs are amazing resilient souls❤
Just luv that. What a beautiful pupper.💖
that isn't how leashes work, or do you want to buy a scooter for the other dog.
😢beautiful doggos
Pure joy 🥹
Sweet dog 😊
❤❤❤❤❤ пёсику у которого задние ножки не работают и женщине  спасибо огромное честь и хвала за пёсика 💐🌹💐🌹💐🌹💐🌹🌺🌷🌸🏵️🌻💮💐💐🌹💐🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🦮🦮🦮🦮🦮🦮

Hes like the cool kid in school that got to wear heely's 😂❤
Do his lil feet drag on the concrete?
The people who were walking. Facial expression: priceless
Oh my goodness can you not!! I had tear of happiness getting ready for bed. Oh the joy of a walk with those pups. So, sweet!
Leash law?
Thats a happy dog
Beautiful baby ❤
So gorgeous ❤❤❤❤
So cute ❤
To much love for this a family 😍❤️😊❤️🙏🌹
Your dogs are so cute and happy!
Too cute!! PRAYERS & MORE! BLESSINGS
Best doggos!!!!!
LOVE it!!!
He just needs some boots on his back legs to protect them from being scraped.
Das ist sooo schön , danke das du dich kümmerst ❤
That’s how I feel every time I locate my glasses
Look at him go so happy ❤😊
The dogs face just tells me its thinking "NYOOOM" While running with the wheelchair ^-^
He is sooo excited to get out of the house😊
🧡🧡🧡
BEAUTIFUL ❤❤
Thank you ❤
❤
Just so he doesn’t run into the street chasing something!
Bless ❤
Ya got to pull his rear legs up a bit … but looks so excited
❤❤❤❤
I love it !  The black and white dog grabs his leash and walks his self .  I basically did the same thing with my dog .  She was a GSD and basically didn’t need a leash .  She knew the rules , stayed a couple of feet in front of me , stoped at the stop sign , and when we got to the park she’d make up her mind if she wanted to go around the lake or through the woods , or to the dog park .  I got a short leash and wrapped it inside her collar  ( leash laws ) .  I carried her reg leash just in case .  We had other places we would go , she knew when to stay by me and where she could run free .
That's precious ❤
The golden- want to see some real speed I show you some real SPEED *vroom*
What a great place to live for everybody❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
The other dog though.
Everyone talking about the wheelchair dog . What about the one carrying his own leash
I'm going to hell. I thought that dog had worms at first
😂😂😂❤❤❤❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻👏👏👏
Oh Yay!! 😂😂🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰👏👏👏👏👏
Look at God mercy and grace!
I am crying right now, your pups are just so full of life!!!!
God bless you, I have a 17 year old rescue who has to be carried every where. I don't mind, he ain't heavy he's my brother!!!
God bless ❤ I hope people can learn from doggy's joy for life😅❤❤Amen
Some of the happiest puppies I have ever seen!         Now I need to grab the leashes & head out with mine.
I would name him joe 😂
This is so precious ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
it is so nive to see his joy that he is goung t oget the wheels and can RUN RUN RUN
Precious
He is one lucky dog! 😍
So beautiful
What an amazing invention! And that doggo loves it!
What a beautiful lady ❤
Any chance we could get that dog some Skyway mags from the 80s?
Very cute but please keep your dogs on a leash on a public sidewalk. 😁
Bless your heart, he seems soooo happy.
I love this doggie ❤🐾🐕‍🦺
I wish they had that when my mirror and Ashanti were alive, instead of relying on a friend to help me carry mirror when she tired out mid hike.
Kiss him for me.
Put something on 'lightnings' back feet to keep them from getting drag burns on the toes. Looks like it might need that.😂  Love your stuartship of these animals, your an angel.❤
Love this very much
The pup walking his self is hilarious and the gorgeous pup with the wheels can move with his cart.  Both definitely loved and well cared for.
💜💜💜
This is everything. You are such a great dog Mama 💕
❤❤❤🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀
Its wonderful what you are doing for them. Might be an idea to put little booties on his hind legs so he doesnt create wounds from the sidewalk
Got the zoomies.
So well trained and happy🥰
happy happy happy happy happy dog!
❤❤❤
Very nice. But the wheels in the back look wobbly
❤❤❤❤❤❤
So adorable. Nothing stops yr furbaby. 😊
I am im tears.....happy tears. I don't know the circumstances, but you gave him/her ability to get around and play..what a happy dog...and lucky to have you.
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
so excited, but remains calm for the harness. what a precious one
This is just the BEST thing I've seen in a very long time!!               💕🐾💕🐾💕🐾💕🐾💕🐾💕🐾💕 (We humans could learn a lot from this gorgeous pup!!)
IS THE DOG WALKING ITSELF THO???
You are such a good mama ❤❤❤
Doesn't his legs dragging like that get raw from scraping the sidewalk?❤❤❤❤
Video is still part of me and the dog is just being a dog. Thank you for being a nice human to this lovely animal and all your animals in everything. Thank you for your service thank you bye and love and support for animals
Seriously! Letting the dogs run in the road !     I love the dogs but this woman needs a lesson in how to look after them.
So heartwarming to watch.  Bless them ❤❤
So happy
He's no less a dog than any.
Soooo beautiful!
Your an earth angel full time job caring for them thank you bl❤
Omg. How wonderful. Kudos to the person who invented that so paralyzed animals could walk. Animals are gods beautiful creations. Warms my heart. ❤❤
I just love people who help their paralyzed pets ❤
Bless you all.
He’s so adorable !!!❤
I love thos! What a kind human to care for thos sweet dog.
No self pitty with that baby.
Imagine filling out a missing dog report. "Is there a part of your dog that stands out?" "She has wheels" 😂😂😂
That excitement  is fun to see so happy ❤❤❤❤❤❤
So sad..😢 But Happy that there are devices to help animals with disabilities..  Live a happier life...😮❤😊
Wondrous!
I just want to warn you about that doggie wheelchair. Your dog could actually be dragging its toes on the ground. Which could cause them to become raw and bloody. You may want to invest in one that maybe the wheels are a little taller. That way it lifts her hind and up a little more just so it keeps your toes from dragging on the ground. Justice light suggestion
I wish i had the ability to do this for my corgi 😢 i just couldnt afford a wheelchair for her and no one willing to help me so the vets recommended we put her down😔
Beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You need to leash your dogs
I’m over here crying because of the sweetness I see thank you for being such a beautiful person ❤
I truly admire you for taking care of this dog with so much love. God truly has an angel.
This just makes me so happy … I’m almost crying
XOXO ❤
God bless that beautiful dog her or him and the owner that is giving that beautiful dog love ❤🙏💋
What an adorable dog.
Wooo !  Look at him go !     💕
So beautiful, thank you for making me smile the biggest smile in a long time 🌹🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Thank you for helping p, give him some legs back God Bless 🙏🙏🙏.
Love how the other dog jumps up to grab it's leash & then runs outside.
His little paw is dragging the ground 😞
You are taking such a good care of these beautiful soul. Thank you.
Please go with them and have them leashed to you.
Awh, glad to see him get out and about. I'd be worried about them zooming past driveways and a car pulled out.😮
Love 💕 this sweet pooch !  💝💖💕💘🐾🐶
That's wonderful ❤️❤️❤️
😱😳🥺 Extremely adorable and full of excitement 😆😄😀
Mom...do you really trust the traffic....and both of your guys??
You gave him "legs" ❤  how beautiful is his reaction? OH MY WORD!

GOD BLESS YOU AND YOU BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS GOD BLESS YOU ALL SWEET LADY LOVE CHRISTINA MARIE😊

To whoever made those wheelchairs for dog's God bless you, they make so many animals happy that they can be free and have mobility as well😊😊.

I love the way the wheels independently so the dog can balance that long body.  A lot of thought and effort went into that contraption.  It’s so awesome to see what an amazing life he has! ❤
I love it ,but her hind legs are dragging on the ground fix it
That is soo precious 😍 to see a very happy pup  amazing 😊😊
I got my wheels on; I'm ready to go; Let's Ride!

So loving
You are an awesome person for giving your kiddo a wonderful life ❤️
My friend made a wheelchair for her dog a Blue Healer that got a tap from a car. He was young and he made it through and relearned to walk so my neighbor said she was paying it forward to someone else that needed the wheelchair for their dog. By the way the Blue Heelers name is Gus. We helped babysit him when his owner needed to go to do things. It was awesome seeing him get better we love Gus🦊🐾🐾Thank you for loving your dog and your dedication to help him have a normal life and God thanks you
I honor your soul for giving him an oportuunity to ennjoy life! Happy chinese dog year ❤ i adopted 9 ,🐶blessings from mexico ❤🎉
Why is Adams REDUCING POLICE?
Amen❤
Him scooting across the floor was one of the funniest things I've seen. It reminded me of those videos where you see a skateboard with a cat on it glide across the floor in front of a camera.
Wow! Thanks for helping that Dog to overcome his disability! You are excellent people!
From Wisconsin I love the fact you took the time to keep the dog's spirit's up & live life
Made my day
To see them so happy like that puts a smile on my face ❤
This video is awesome. God Bless This Owner and her pets❤
running like the wind; not only in his dreams
Where can I get one for my dog
It looks cool and the puppy is able to run with his friend. The wheelchair is super great
This made my heart so happy!!❤❤
Angelic beings. ❤
Keeping a dog alive that can’t go to the bathroom on its own, can’t even stand, probably gets all sorts of sores from dragging itself around is wrong
Do her feet drag?
It takes patience,love and understanding.. Thank you ..
This is too cute to handle. His floor scoots look exactly how i move without my chair I'm dead 😭😭😭
So happy your baby has such a great wheel chair
Hope I have that much excitement when I am ten years old.. again..
wow.. looked like hind legs were swinging correctly at the end.. ❤🍻 last few steps..
I love everything about this!  “Excuse us” we’re just regular pups, kids excited about getting outside and having fun.
He is so happy Thanks for  sharing
This dog has been blessed. 🙏 Amen 😇 🙏 I love 😂all you blessed animal lovers ❤️  to the owner of this beautiful dog  I love you ❤
Omg, soooo cute. God bless him. ❤❤❤
This makes my heart happy 😊
What a great clip of two wonderful dogs with lovely owners.  And the dog doing "wheelies" so fast is amazing. Blessings.💞
Precious! He has so much fun because you cared to go that extra mile for his life enjoyment. Amen to all that!😊
Gouges lovely ❤❤❤
Great. Now I'm comparing my lazy a$$ self to a paraplegic dog. And I'm not looking good!  Time to get Goin'!
I guarantee the other dog is jealous that he can't do Zoomies on wheels 😂😁
Such good recalls to enjoy a little off-leash time on the sidewalk! Bravo! Cookies to the good trainer! Those are lucky, loved dog babies!
Thank God for that wheelchair
I’m crying with excitement.
The excitement to go for a walk
They’re so precious. Thank you for giving them such a wonderful life.
That is sooooo cute !!!!
This is so heartwarming. 🥰🤗🥰🤗
We just ordered one for one of our fur babies!  I hope he enjoys it as much!  So heartwarming! ❤
Esa es la gente q vale oro . Dios la bendiga !!!!
I've seen braces on some that would support his back legs so they won't drag. Great video ❤❤❤
Ó how absolutely beautiful both of them
Love pure love
Aww ❤❤❤❤❤
Excuse us.
Gleeful angels!!!💕
Best thing all week! ❤❤❤❤❤
Just do happy to be a regular pup!! Awe…..
All love and respect. You're a rarity. Not enough love in this world but you have more than most
❤❤❤❤
That is so cool to see super happy wheely pups
Pure joy!
❤❤❤
Do his back paws need booties to keep them from dragging on the pavement?  In grass it would not hurt the paw, but concrete can. What a great dog Mom, that wheelchair is fantastic.  Gave the pup his joy and vitality back.  So cute when they go running together.   God bless this precious family.  Stay safe, watch out for cars and aggressive dogs.
They're adorable!...She just lets them loose like that though? 🤨 "'Scuse us 😅" 🤦🏻‍♀️No, Not smart, at all. Why? For views?? Smh...Makes me wonder how the dog ended up in a wheelchair to begin with 😒 She can't put the phone down & just walk her dogs on a leash...if they were calmly walking right next to her, that would be a bit different, but they get a little too far for comfort towards the end...I liked this video up until the end...
Great solution to give the dog a sense of independence!  However, I am concerned about his back paws dragging on the ground.  Maybe a tough pair of doggie boots or shoes would protect his tear paws from injury from dragging them on rough ground, sidewalks, street pavement, lawns that might have hidden items that could cause injury or waste (poop) and other germs that could get into a scrape and cause horrendous infections, etc.
The floor scoots! That face!! The excitement! I can't!!! 😍
❤❤❤❤❤
omg cute
How does he go outside to pee (etc)??? Can't do that with the cart. #1 probably, but not #2...🤔
too lovely. such a beautiful pup just living their best  life.
This is so cool 😛 ❤
🥲❤️🥲
So precious!
He is a precious baby! 😍😍😍
