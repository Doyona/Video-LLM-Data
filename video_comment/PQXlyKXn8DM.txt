Yall wanted him to beeeeeggggg yaall 😂😂😂😂😂..... Nah we gonna ride fir our boy
Watching this in November and Rich was 199 percent right. They plotted against the boy and now its slowly falling apart
To the guy who mentioned the teams having their own media... yeah. They want to control the narrative. Not their 3rd string QB. Just bc the teams have social media, doesn't mean they want players to.
So the Steelers held out for 40 year old QB, and passed on a new one fresh out of college.    Give me a break.
These guys cant be that naive. Smh
You are not just picked by your talent but also by your attitude and mental well-being. Obviously there was something wrong if all the teams passed on him. just saw a different video where they blaimed the league  for "not knowing what to do with a free black man", WTF
Obviously something "went wrong" in his team meetings to have every team passed on him.  Word is he didn't treat it as a job interview.
So historically, when a QB draft prospect has been known to party instead of watching film and putting in the time to get better on the field. They have failed to turn into a decent to great QB. Look at Johnny Manzel, Ryan Leaf, Jamarcus Russel, Vince Young, and Deshaun Watson. They failed because of a lack of work ethic. When your in the NFL as a starting QB you need to put the work in. If the NFL teams don't see a high work ethic and have entitlement issues then why draft them? Rich your smarter than that.
Steve Madden had shadeuer at 2026 draft round 5 😂😂😂
Great work!! If I had the money I’d fly you guys to North Carolina and do my master bath and second bath room.
Maybe it isn't the teams. Maybe it's people like you and the rest of woke sports media. He is a backup at Best. He is black. Deon son. So automatically hall of famer. There were QB who had 40 TDS at BYU or Hawaii that didn't get drafted. If he isn't coachable then you don't need him. What was statement he made. If teams aren't ready for a culture change then don't draft him. Get off your knees rich. Deon isn't in the room
Argoooooossss
-Legendary? Shedeur wasn’t drafted because no one wants to deal with a Mediocre, a spoiled, narcissistic brat who thinks he’s more valuable than anyone else.
Serious question: Colon Kapertard said the NFL was modern-day slavery. Why would anybody want to play for them?😂
Reckon he'll play in the UFL or CFL?
Sanders went to a bad school played weak competition and is under sized. This was a WEAK qb class. Had he come out next year he’d be drafted the same round. He went to arguably the worst sports franchise in American sports. He won’t succeed
sanders was interviewed and he came off with a lousy attitude.  Race has nothing to do with it. Ryan Leaf was white and he had a screwed up attitude. look what happened to him
Charles Davis made the most intelligent counterpoint to the social media argument I have heard in awhile.
He's not strong enough to carry his own baggage.
144th That's so GROSS. 😎😎😎😎 It's OK  I'll wait
You are all cowards ! It’s his Dad no NFL team wants to be second guessed by his Dad. Cowards can’t say it
The guy with a self-promoting LEGENDARY She Shed fell in the draft. NOT SHOCKING. 13-12 record. 0 bowl wins.
THANKS Rich!! it’s b.s. and you’re calling it just that!
Look what happened to Tebow...enough said
NFL COLLUSION. DISGRACE! QB A. MANNING will get privileged treatment in the next 2026 NFL Draft by the WHITE NFL Owners.
Shedeur has an iq of 80.. listen to him speak
Honestly, shame on Rich and them. "Let's let Shadeur have his moment after we completely ignored the rest of the field so we could talk about Shadeur" is such a joke. I used to enjoy Rich and tolerate his takes. Now I can't stand to look at him because he just proved himself to be yet another media hack.
Deons kids are all B league players. None of them are any good compared to most of the top talent.
The anti-black race war is a thing that doesn’t take a second off!
I'm so tired of this.  Shedeur wouldn't workout for some teams, didn't participate in the combine, and his dad said "We" won't play for some teams.  "We"???  Who's we, Deion?  Shedeur is NOT a generational talent, not even close.  Deion was.  And people are surprised that nobody wants to draft this kid.  Sports casters and commentators are shocked, yet they aren't the ones with the checkbook taking on and paying for this headache named Shedeur/Deion Sanders.
Imagine trying to control what team drafts your son. Talk about controlling.. On top of that, I don't think this is how it went when Brady got drafted when he did. Just because you aren't a first round pick doesn't mean you wont be a great player. Brady is the F'n GOAT and he didn't complain about not being a first round pick. Be greateful for being drafted in the first place wether it be the first pick or the last pick. Talk about soft... Jeeze, grow up...
Shedeur isn't the fastest, most agile, tallest, or strongest thrower in the draft class among the QB class. He's an inch shorter than Drew Brees. He doesn't have an overly strong arm. Yes, he's accurate. But when you also take 94 sacks in just 2 college seasons, that is a sign that he's likely not going to have a good or long career.   Then factor in his father saying "WE choose who he plays for", the NFL went out of their way to send him a message. That's why he went in the 5th to Cleveland. A team with a bad O-line and zero QB depth.
He’s not his dad. He can’t show up the combine run the 40 then roll out. His father was just an amazing player.
Self reflection isn’t a Sanders Family strength.
A disgrace.
Shedeur blew numerous interviews. The fact he does not give a rip about what anyone thinks about him is telling.
Humble pie served to SS!!
He should go play in Canada, if he does great there he’ll get back to the league.
SS does not try when his team is down two scores.   SS is a quitter.    SS will run his mouth and cheer it up when his team is winning, but pouts and has no strategy when losing.    He is a Kyler Murray without the  running skills to get a first down.   SS will get picked eventually
Deon:  he not playing for the Cleveland Browns!!! Sanders goes to the Cleveland Browns😂😂😂
I’m not reaching out to no one. I would go in as an undrafted player & work my behind off when I’m in that room. I’m not begging no one to draft me. I’m glad they eventually called Sheduer’s name.
Will Howard is the surprise. National champion who is 6' 4 and can really move. Milroe is also pretty good. Played against the SEC and runs a 4.4.
I got a fucked up father whose cost me a whole lot in my life too. Another thing me and Shaduer Sanders have in common: Neither of us was ever a legitimate 1st round NFL prospect.
This has Kapernick vibes all over it.
Missed his last game due to a back injury and did nothing at the combine.   That is enough to drop completely out of the draft.
Gotta feeling he was arrogant in those team meeting and the owners decided to teach him a lesson. Who wanna bet?
I can’t believe the Raiders didn’t take him 🤦‍♂️
His ego and prima dona attitude along with his father’s blustering, cost him.  If he continues this cockiness, he’s going to wash up big time.
I love Rich, but his politics steer him into a ditch sometimes.
Carma for his cockiness 😂
Rich is using the term red flags as if all issues of concern are equal, so it was somehow unfair how Sanders was treated (as if he was owed something). The concern teams apparently had with Sanders was his attitude he displayed which was almost an indfference, that he isn’t focused on what he needs to be. And that has been seen too many times at the QB position and it results in a disaster. Other players have red flags for a variety of reason, behavior, injuries, actual skill, those are different and teams can analyze those more routinely in determining if and when to draft players, considering are they a fit, ie, is the team good and dealong with the specific issue. Those issues have nothing to do with a draftee’s passion for the game, that is almost impossible for a team to change.   All that said, I think a lot of teams made a mistake not grabbing him sooner, after the first few rounds the draft is all about predicting upside and Sanders has proven skills, albeit with his father as his head coach creating the situation where he would be successful. But even taking that into account he was one of the best QBs and if he had gone in the second round it wouldn’t have been any riskier a selection than others in that round.
John Elway did it , nobody did this. The Manning's did it, nobody did this. Sanders do now it's a problem ? Lol wow
O one wants to deal with his attitude and the drama his. Dad will bring! The browns are gonna give him one chance ad then traded him.
Browns are going to regret that pick
His fall has as much to do with his father as himself
The NFL wanted nothing to do with Shadeur’s red flag riddled personality, and they didn’t want to deal with papa Deion’s circus, and I don’t fault the league one bit for feeling that way. Time will tell what kind of professional career he has, but I think it’s more likely that it’s more Johnny Manziel than it is Lamar Jackson.
Sad thing is all of these guys are afraid of Dion.
No it should be public, just like it was Sheddeur humble yourselfs.
He doesn't need to self reflect you had playera that were drafted with criminal behavior, some flashly, none of them needed to ge humbled stop with the bs it was personal.
He's Colin Kaepernick with less natural ability and none of the moral basis for media attention, and that's before he bombed his interviews. What in this dude's profile says anything but late round pick?
Great when the conversation was objective but once it became an emotionally based perspective(s).....So sad.
What happens on the field wins games, what happens off the field wins championships.
I see a bunch of clowns
Just don’t say anything, the proof is in action, make them regret it!
Another Antonio Brown
U don't want a quarterback that thinks they know more than you or his dad running the show
who the F interupts Rich Eisen, on his show, on his first comment.  This guy will never do his show again.
You guys slobbing on his knob too? 😅
"Deep personal reflection"?  Truly a hallmark of the Sanders men...
LMAO ! CLOWN SHOW !
There's no way multiple teams have all gotten together and decided to punish this kid because of his dad without it making it to the public and being a massive scandal. They did it to themselves.
I think to be a great QB you have to be humble. Saunders is an amazing player but to say there are some team you wont play for says all you need to know about him! His father was able to be cocky because he wasn't a QB.
Thank you for saying this is BS!!! I would’ve drafted sanders in the first round esp my team 49ers!! Like wtf
Hey Rich.. you are talking RIGHT NOW for many minutes about what is going to be a backup.. How can you say that media won't talk about the backup when you all are spending tons of time right now doing just that.
"This league never turns it's back on talent."  Really?  Ask Colin Kaepernick.
Not drafting Sanders is racist comments incoming
Whole draft was about one person apparently.
Man I miss Mike Mayock
Sanders doesn't compare to any qb outside the big 12. All other QB's outside the big 12 had a frontline, running backs.  More than half the QB's wont even start, and if its about money, he'll always have money.
They trying to “Buck Break” the young man. Never be humble.
His slide is all on Deion, no question.
You don't get Sanders without his Father.  I assume they learned from the Ball family situation in the NBA.
Collusion by the league.
Crazy not even Duval took him, the boy has crazy talent and plenty of room to grow. A dude from the smallest private school in my county in FL has been drafted, and their talent level is no where near the same.
Kinda like a Angel Reese story 😂
So ironic for Rich to say Coaches shouldnt be worried about the Shedeur media attention... while at the same time being a big media sports host and  calling out the coaches dor not takingbuim and saying all these locker rooms are fragile for not thinking they can handle it 😂
The NFL IS DISGRACEFUL
Everyone knew it would be the Jets or the Browns for Shedeur. Him and dad just didn’t get that memo
my toxicity was thriving for days …   😅
He's going undrafted because the parent-associate model is embarrassing and adds pointless complication to every facet of the situation. A few players got away with it in recent years, but because the results aren't universally reliable then they're useless, and if the complications can be avoided then they will be avoided.   I wish him the absolute best nonetheless.
Sander will be a steal at round 2-3-4…he will be a beast. Going 2-3-4 rounds will make him a better player as he will have to fight for his spot instead of going 1 round and act like a Superstar without playing a snap. Sanders is a moron on 1 round whereas round 2-3-4 will put him into reality thus lay low and let his game speak for itself instead of all the hoopla.
They always say a QB has gotta have that swagger and leadership and confidence.. sanders shows up and they’re like “nah we good”
NFL isn't about the best players. It's about the best players who will be controlled. They dont want individuals, they want cogs to stfu and do their job. NFL doesn't work that way anymore.
He was 13-12 as a starter for Colorado... what are we even talking about?! 😅😂
"just, you do it to yourself you do... and that's what really hurts, is you do it to yourself (it's true) you and no one else. ~radiohead.
Remember, Tim Tebow went #1 in the draft 😳
Rich Eisen knows why nobody drafted him. Sanders is arrogant...and is a ticking time bomb. If his talent was there, he would have been drafted...he is way too arrogant, and mislead...sanders should go undrafted and fight his way in. It is a privaledge to be in  the league...Sanders is a self centered, problem...i wouldn't draft him either.
Maybe the lesson is...be more humble. STFU and realize you are not as good as you think you are.  There is always someone better than you and you always have to prove yourself. Your name only takes you so far.
Arguably the most obvious locker room cancer since Jeff George. Sanders will never start a playoff game.
Cowboys in 3 2 1
No amount of circus would prevent an NFL team from taking Sanders if he was a really super candidate. It's a business. Maybe the kid just isn't that good.
Sheduer Sanders is not that good. His arm strength is weak. His not a mobile quarterback obviously he didn't get dad's speed. I think he's overrated. And to not throw in the combine or visit rep's of NFL teams is him and his father being in his ear telling him lies about his ability. This is a classic case of bling around the neck and thinking he can ride the coat tails of daddy. I bet he failes in the NFL...
1) He's already 2) From what I've seen, hes seems kind 3) He made it into the NFL, thats less than 1.7% of NCAA players 4) He's about to make easy money 5) I am sure he isn't worried
i wouldn't wanna coach shaduer sanders if i was an NFL head coach.  he's not gonna be better than tua... or dak... or kirk cousins.  with the self proclaimed greatness of someone with the accomplishments of tom brady or patrick mahomes.   a high school coach don't want a daddy coaching from the sideline.
No head coach wants dad second guessing every decision.
Rich Eisen: always the bleeding heart crybaby
This is what happens when you let your daddy do all the talking and your daddy is neon Dion
Just another arrogant, "I'm entitled", S._B.
“Deion, make the check out to R-I-C-H   E-I-S-E-N”
I watched Shiter Saunders over the last two years…never thought Shiter was all that good.
OK, so NFL teams are desperate for QB's and they wouldn't take Sanders? Lol, when did the NFL care about a player's behavior on or off the field whether they are QB or not? Did he do something really bad or is this a power play by the NFL?
Rich bieng pissed about this is hilarious
Reminds me of the Ball brothers and their father. Where are they now?  I wouldn't want to coach, play with or pay Shadeur Sanders. Don't get me started on his father.
Deion hurt his son in numerous interviews prior to March stating that there were NFL teams that he wouldn’t allow his son to play for.  Those interviews stopped in March when someone told him to shut up.  Of the 7-8 teams interested in drafting a guy in a weak QB class, Deion managed to piss-off most of them. Toss in his son’s immature behavior in interviews and his Dad’s potential public criticism of coaches and teams, it’s not surprising that franchises steered clear because the kid’s current talent level wasn’t worth the downside and distraction. They didn’t want to join the circus.
Shedeur Sanders' unchecked ego IS a "red flag!"
Easy answer: nobody is entitled to anything.
Mike Tomlin passed how many times on sanders ? That says so much
Yeah, pass on the begging dude. I wouldn't anyway. Beg someone who has something personal against me to do something I showed at Colorado on the field? Yeah, no thank you. I would just go back to school and do something else. It's NEVER that serious.  You don't like me for whatever reason, then it would have to be what it is. Get my degree and go do something else. Say it's been a thrill to play amateur football.  Play for dad. Then keep it moving.   Man  wasn't stealing food out of a grocery  store and accused of sexual assault like Winston.  Racial stuff said in the past like Allen. The many personal problems off the field of Manziel.  The crotch grabbing and chip on his shoulder every five minutes of Mayfield.  The basically stupidity of Russell but he was quiet and humbly went about his life before becoming a bust. They all went on day one.  They just tremendously dislike how Shedeur carries himself and if I was him, I would NEVER beg ANYONE who didn't like the person I am. Full pass on that!
The problem is Dion! Shedeur will be a backup for a few years, contract will run out, he won’t get picked up and he will make millions coaching with his father.
He is a middle 5th round pick that is all he is. what was his record at Colorado? It was mediocre. did he get sacked all the time with out getting rid of the ball? yes he did.  he was horrible at that part of his game. And he blew off The combines and then showed immaturity not even attending draft itself. The League drafted him exactly where he should be. No conspiracy, no sending message. He could even get cut by the browns.5 th rounders get cut.  His father was great and he isnt. Lebron is great and his son sucks.
But but but “ quarterback is different.” Here is an example of why it’s not.”but but but, please we have a plan.”
3:33 “Nobody wants the camera and microphone in the backup quarterback’s locker.”
Hes just not that good and has too much drama i wouldnt touch him
Nobody has to pick him. Just work hard to prove them wrong like Brady did. All this crap is why nobody wanted to puck him.
Other than Ward, I hope all the other QBs before Sanders fail miserably. And Ward went to a dumpster fire (same as Sanders) so their success will likely be graded on a curve at first.
Do you think Cleveland was one of those teams that Deion didn’t want his son playing for
Eisen is into promoting the victim mentality for millionaires.
Deion is the NFL's version of Lavar ball
Has Deion claimed racism yet?
Shedeur behaves l'île à thug.
I think a group of Coaches and GM’s wanted to give Shedeur an attitude adjustment. To go in the 5th round and then to go to the Browns is insult to injury.  It was also designed to shut Deon Sanders up and dissuade him from being critical. I believe it was collusion and the NFL Commissioner should conduct an investigation for the integrity of the league and to protect the shield. It’s a terrible look for the NFL. Lastly, Cleveland could have had BOTH Hunter and Sanders! They would have won the draft hands down and the world would be abuzz. Instead, a group of plantation owners got together to degrade the brothers.
Damn with all that jewelry he's still got rejected........ young football players are the definition of arrogance
This guy literally said to beg!!! to be drafted that’s wild!
Sanders is too arrogant. Thought he was Tom Brady, before even playing a down in training camp, because his dad is a HOF and the greatest corner ever. That's what growing up as a rich kid with an unchecked ego does to you.  Bron and Shaq did a better job with their sons, way more humble than Shedeur.

NFL teams are full of horse manure...
Rich teaching!
Is Shedeur the result of an early AI name generator?
I love Rich, lot of respect, favorite guy to listen to around the NFL but his loyalty towards the Sanders family is ludicrous  The kid is no better than Matt Corral was, harsh reality.... AND there's baggage!! He'll be lucky to be in the NFL 3 years from now
Plot twist! Shedeur rightfully earns the starting position, but instead they give him the backup position,  starter goes down, #2 leads his team to their first championship in 60 years!!!   This old/outdated, "good old boy" mentality of oppression that "athletes need to be humble", is/was absolutely ridiculous and not consistent with the competitive nature of the sport. It has more to do with oppressing certain demographics. Trying to keep athletes humble, is really just saying "keep them in their place". A great percentage of the athletes in professional sports are loud and proud. We should be celebrating that and allowing them to be who they are. On the other hand, if someone owns a team, they have every right to hire who they want. If the teams/the league really want to send a message, they should come out with it and be completely one 💯% open.  I suppose this one is pretty easy and plain to figure out though. Some of us have been part of the Sanders camp since the mid 90s. Some people like the quiet, humble type and some are the complete opposite. I can see redeeming qualities in both, but I don't live with the mentality that either one his ideal or correct.
They (NFL) all know something WE DON'T.  and we'll never know.
The biggest issue is that the owners NEVER have to appear at a press conference like the players do
This reminds of Rich's pearl clutching when RB werent getting paid 3 years ago...
4:09 Rich using the stealers as the example for "coaches/organization" is comical. THATS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. Leveon Bell, Big Ben, AB, JuJu all had cameras all over the room and stirring up bs uncontrolled.
Yt folks gotta learn to start being comfortable around black confidence it’s amazing how we still gotta humble ourselves for yt society
Entitlement.
Splaining for massa
It was personal…He acted like a punk on the field how many times and then the combine and dad BS?!?  Sounds like Nico!  🤣👊🏻🏈
Well, that went well for ‘em….🤣👊🏻🏈
I think a lot of teams pass on him because they know if they draft him they are also bringing the baggage that is Deion
Was that Rich Glazer?
Actually thought browns did well in the draft and then pulled a browns thing to do and drafted this bum.
Power wins, sometimes there’s confusion over who has it
"The NFL is sending a message" yeah, the message is that the kid has average arm strength, isn't much of a runner, and is likely to be a mid-level QB.
All this is irrelevant... The organization, while trying to " serve humble pie" ended up drafting him anyway. If he wasn't talented or interviewed terribly, then the Browns should have stood on business and not drafted him. The truth is the haters hate the Sanders name. But they all need it. Same with his dad back in the day, and same with his son now. This was all an attempt to diminish Shadures confidence by devaluing his talent.
Did Peion beg Cleveland to pick his baby boy?
No one knows what happened in those interviews. He definitely isn’t the cocky type. He talks very calm. People prob mistake that for not motivated or not taking it serious. These gms and owners are so stubborn and old. Shedeur just needs to be himself and focus on being a great person. Being a great athlete is secondary and I hope he knows that.
Maybe, just maybe, the media overhyped him just like they did Colorado for the last 2 years.  This is not some league-wide conspiracy.
Who cares. Constantly talking about this ruined the draft show.
Sanders drives a Rolls Royce and wears a $100K watch he shoves in others faces...is he hungry enough to work? Is he hungry enough to be a backup and not be a distraction? Seems a lot teams thought there was way more sizzle than steak. Why waste a 1st or 2nd round pick on someone who may not be hungry
Lol it's always these old talking heads defending the BS of the league and how it treats certain players is laughable 😂.  Rich was the only one talking sense.   And to Klatts point saying QB is different yeah sure pal it's only different when they aren't white like it or not. No not race baiting but it's still a thing in the NFL the black QBs unless they are mahomes are judged differently.  The NFL is also sticking it to Dieon.
Don't the NFL have hard knocks and Mic up!!!!!
Being a good teammate is priceless. Shedeur has cast doubt as to how good a teammate he will be. Brady was not the best at any single physical or technical aspect of the QB position - he was the ultimate teammate, though, and made those around him play above themselves.
If Shedeur Sanders were the same complexion as John Elway, he would have been drafted in the first round.
Shedeur Sanders = Bronny James
All the Shadeur loving crybabies are not real football fans. Yelling for your team (talking to you ill informed Steelers fans) to use a high draft pick on a backup QB is ridiculous and embarrassing lol. Especially wanting him over AARON FRICKIN RODGERS!!!!

I don't know why but when ive seen the video where Cam Newton went to Colorado to meet him n he just turned his back to him, that wasn't a good look. No one not even these tv analysts know what happened in those interviews!! Until u know, these guys shouldn't flame this up. I heard when he went to the Giants, he pissed Daboll off n they said they were done with him. Everyone can be pissed but the owners have the billions n will decide this n none of this matters!! I do feel bad for him n the prank calls were bullshit but they said he had one phone for the team to call him so who leaked the # out?? Idk it can go both ways on this but it's definitely not about his fb skills as a qb!!! 2 teams have come out n basically said it was attitude. Maybe this humbles him n comes out n does great!!!

No NFL team is going to take the "Dione Sanders" attitude of "what I-I-I deserve" for longer than one season.  His son may end up in the CFL or USA league, which is probably where he belongs.  I don't believe he is an exceptional talent, as time on the field will show.

I’m not a Coach Deion fan, I was a huge Deion as a player fan. First round ok I get the message nfl. Second round I’m like WTF. Third round it’s personal and simply wrong. Fourth round I may not watch nfl football again because this is punishing a young athlete financially and mentally. This is a modern day public hanging. F the nfl and players should speak out on this and embrace Shadeur and not ostracize him like they did with Colin Kaepernick.

Sanders is overrated and the owners know it. If he didnt have Hunter or a famous dad they wouldnt even talk about him. Hes a bust with an attitude problem and a dad who will try to insert himself into everything. ESPN guys are all friends with Dieon so they are being whiney. Kiper is just mad because he has never ever been close to right about anything

I remember when kids just wanted to getting drafted period.  Now there selfish and I don't want to play here or there I mean give me a break. The working people of the world work alot of jobs they dont want but have too. All these athletes need a wake up call. Paid in college with a free ride on top of it. And we wonder why there self seving brats
This video made me understand more than ever. This was to set an example for future players to not feel they’ll decide who they wanna play for.

Shedeur is at best a mediocre NFL level talent who probably will never be a starter on a decent team. With his sense of entitlement and inflated view of himself, he will likely be poison in the locker room. Add in the fact that Deion will be trying to control everything and you have some very good reasons that the NFL didn't knock down Shedeur's door.  Deion is Scott Frost 2.0, btw.

A lot of people with money and especially those who never had anything and all of sudden they’re wealthy they act like they’re those owners of someone else business, it’s FKN DISGUSTING and I’m glad they humbled him and to those who were thinking about doing this!!! Deion Sanders played a huge role on why his son was picked in the 5th round! Deion on went an interview rampage saying that son is not going to sign with the majority of the league and to not think drafting him because he won’t play!! Unfortunately the Cleveland Browns has labeled as dysfunctional Organization for a long time. How come he hasn’t come to say his son won’t play for them? Ooohhhhh cause you realized you almost screwed up your son’s future

No one is bigger than the league. I’m a hockey guy and Shane Wright was the number 1 pick for the longest time but he had a poor interview with Montreal and the other teams or teams did their research on background and he dropped to fourth overall. Sanders said he’s not playing for certain teams and Prime said he will cause havoc behind the scenes. Why would anyone want that in their locker room?

If you look and what Sanders did against good college teams why would you want him in control of an NFL team?   I am not talking about drama.  I am talking about his production, or lack of production against good teams.  It is almost like this kid goes away and hides when the chips are down.   Pretty obvious why he has fallen.  I would not want this kid leading my team.

Or could have something to do with a lot of GM said it was the worst personal interviews they've ever encountered. The kid had terrible body language was pointing his fingers at his teammates and had the sense of entitlement. That's why he's not getting drafted

Coach prime has his own team to worry about he not going to be in your locker room doing anything so dew away with that narrative the boy can play football and he’s a great person to have on the team aswell as a great qb not to mention his mentor is Tom Brady how you a team in need of a quarterback and you pass on someone like that

No other top QB had to beg to get drafted. Why should Sanders? Johnny Football called the Browns and got drafted immediately. Stop the BS. We know what this is about. 💯

I'm happy he's in Cleveland, because he's going to go on a revenge tour. BUT, I don't get taking both him and Gabriel, who was my projected want because I didn't see Sanders falling like he did, and they didn't address needs at WR or the OLine. Also, while Rich is a Xichigan Xan, he absolutely has a point with his complaints here, because the math isn't mathing with all of this.
This happens literally every year in the draft. Some guy that the talking heads cant believe fell in the draft or went undrafted. If it wasn't for his dad, we wouldn't be hearing all of this crying

Genuine question here: What did Sanders do to piss everyone off? I'm out of the loop. I agree with Rich's point that the NFL ignores some absolutely toxic and abhorrent behavior if it is a player who is seen as too valuable to let go (Big Ben, Tyreek Hill, etc). Did Sanders do something on that level?

This is excuse for the league. This is purposeful by the league. A rookie doesn't have the clout to bring cameras into the locker room. Without someone in those rooms speaking honestly, we'll never know what it truly at play here. The league doesn't give me my living so my perspective doesn't have to be league friendly. These people forget when Tom Brady and Brock Purdy were drafted. Like I said I have a different perspective from this panel.

This is ridiculous.... the young man is just not that damn good. He's small, he holds on to the ball too long, and he's got a weak arm. Add that to the fact that  you have to deal with his father who was the lightning rod for controversy. Nobody wants to deal with that headache.
By him saying, "it HAS to be humble" is directly confirming what everyone else is saying.. the only reason it HAS to be humble is bc "they" are not comfortable with his bravado, confidence and personality. Stop trying to cover up what we already know, it's played out. Ray Charles can see what is going on here - just quit. "They" FOR YEARS, bank on the fact that we can't prove it [so that means that it isn't true]..I hate that part.. you mistreat ppl and hide behind anonymity

DEION ISNT FOLLOWING TRAVIS TO JACKSONVILLE TO HOUND THE TEAM WHEN TRAVIS ISNT GETTING THE TIME DEION WANTS
Pure talent. No words
Pure talent. No words
That attitude did him in
“We’re not in those rooms. We don’t know what they’re thinking” but let’s create conspiracy theories instead of understanding teams don’t want Deion in the room
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
This Shedeur situation made a mockery of the NFL. If players are going to have zero legal trouble, have no scandals, & be high performers but not be chosen on merit, then it's a personality contest. Why try to be the best or put in all the work to be qualified for the position? Because it's the right thing to do? Why do that? The team isn't prioritizing doing the right thing? They don't want the most qualified, skilled, and talented player. They want who makes them feel warm and fuzzy? That's odd. These are adults who are supposed to be trying to pick talent that will help them win, period. Since when has being able to sell jerseys, tickets, and bring fan engagement bad? These grown men need to be honest. An anonymous executive said Shedeur, a 23 y/o, made him feel small. That's that man's insecurity, and they made it Shedeur's problem. This was about pettiness and spitefulness. It wasn't about football.

Shedeur is not picked because  no gm or coach wants Deion barking out in the media if Deion doesn’t like how the team is playing and coaching Shedeur.
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
To be honest they aren’t talking enough about the other kids that have been drafted
No wants to deal with his father interfering if hes not a grown man than go back to college. All u defenders are crap u bring up manning and guess what its been 20 years and its stil talked about because it was crap back then but had more marriotts because it was a tougher sport if manning did thhat crap now he would be with tebo out the league.
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Shadeur, Shadeur, Shadeur, Shadeur, Shadeur—- for weeks on end.  These talking heads are not making the picks.  They are making the news.  And in order to make the news they have to be sensationalists.  We’ll know more as the camps kick off.  But, the guys making the news will never shut up.  Shadeur will be in the Sports News like Trump is in the news.   It will go on forever.

It’s so dumb how the best reason anyone can come up with to draft Sheduer in comment sections is “well this team drafted somebody worse before”….so do it again? Brain dead takes galore
Really appreciate the insights in this video.
This is personal…Telling him to pick up the phone and call GM’s 😂😂😂 He was the top 5 pick and did nothing wrong smh
He does not need the money... Why does a black man have to beg to be chosen. Rubbish
I think coaches and GM’s are worried about Deion taking their jobs after they draft Shedeur.  Ball family treatment

Rich is right.   Somebody paid hundreds of millions for a guy with "massage therapist" issues.  But Sanders - oh he's too outspoken for the NFL. I don't follow college football so I have no idea how good he is or isn't, but pretty sure there are teams with worse QBs.  And if you're a head coach or GM who can't deal with his dad, maybe you aren't leadership material. Just sayin'...
Why do people support corporations so much? Let me know when any NFL team comes to your house to see how you were doing.

List of QB's that won a SB during the "Manning/Brady" era.  Super Bowl 36. Tom Brady (MVP), 1 TD Super Bowl 37. Brad Johnson, 2 TDs Super Bowl 38. Tom Brady (MVP), 3 TDs Super Bowl 39. Tom Brady , 2 TDs Super Bowl 40. Ben Roethlisberger, 0 TDs Super Bowl 41. Peyton Manning (MVP), 1 TD Super Bowl 42. Eli Manning (MVP), 2 TDs Super Bowl 43: Ben Roethlisberger, 1 TD Super Bowl 44: Drew Brees (MVP), 2 TDs Super Bowl 45: Aaron Rogers (MVP), 3TDs Super Bowl 46: Eli Manning (MVP), 1 TD Super Bowl 47: Joe Flacco (MVP), 3TDs Super Bowl 48: Russell Wilson, 2TDs Super Bowl 49: Tom Brady (MVP), 4TDs Super Bowl 50: Peyton Manning, 0TDs Super Bowl 51: Tom Brady (MVP), 2TDs Super Bowl 52: Nick Foles (MVP), 3 TDs Super Bowl 53: Tom Brady, 0TDs Super Bowl 54: Patrick Mahomes (MVP), 2 TDs Super Bowl 55: Tom Brady (MVP), 3 TDs Super Bowl 56: Matthew Stafford, 3 TDs Super Bowl 57: Patrick Mahomes (MVP), 3 TDs Super Bowl 58: Patrick Mahomes (MVP), 2 TDs Super Bowl 59: Jalen Hurts (MVP), 2 TDs  A few repeat names in there, and don't forget to add the repeat names that also LOST a SB during this era too (Brady, Roethlisberger, Mahomes). What you wont see in this list, are the number of highly recruited 1st and 2nd round QB's drafted during this era, that have produced some decent seasons and playoff wins, but have yet to bring home a Lombardi. Deshaun Watson being the star of that list. Heisman winner, great athletic talent, and also the biggest bust and hugely overpaid by a front office that has no business running a front office. Do you think the other 31 teams have taken note and noticed a trend? Everyone wants notoriety and a bag of loot.   There may be some substance to Rich's claim, but it's more than just because of the Sanders' family attitude and approach. It took Matthew Stafford a whole career to win a SB... endured some painful seasons with injury, some painful to watch Lion's teams, but he's a warrior and managed to put up some good stats during that time too. Never once was he the highest paid QB, or darling of the NFL. Is Sheduer cut of that same kind of cloth? Highly doubtful. Is Joe Burrow? Is Brock Purdy? Justin Herbert? There's a whole list of active QB's that are proven to be ballers, but you gotta deliver that trophy. I don't see Sanders as one of those guys. Not even in the same ball park. The level of talent of Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen, with pretty good teams behind them, and still haven't reached their pinnacle. But, they still suit it up, take the hits, and masterfully deal with injury, BS media, and booing and hissing from their fanbases. Sanders isn't that guy...a little adversity and he'd fold like a cheap suit. And frankly, he's just not that talented. From a business view, the NFL sees him as a backup at best, and a backup that would just bring drama to the locker room. Add the Deshaun Watson contract debacle giving QB's a sense of inflated value, and here we are. This is a much bigger picture than these talking heads are willing to see and discuss.
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
White men is the only reason Sanders didn't go higher.
Belichick and Tomlinson wouldn’t pickem in the first place so they wouldn’t have to control any narrative.
Everyone here and in the NFL needs to learn Humility.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
They’re shocked because he’s a capable QB and Rich is mad because there’s so many felons in the league but arrogance gets you Blackballed, key word in that statement is “black.”
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
They know his talent, no need to beg. Get out of here with that. Those other teams will regret their decisions.
Nevermind
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
Gotta be racism! There, card played.
Rich's take is on point!
Red jacket is full of ISH!!! He's talking as if he was in the room with teams and Shedur. We All know why the are White listing Shedur
Sanders needs to go back to college for a year, but not to Colorado… he needs to get away from Daddy and prove himself on his own. All the spotlight put on him has blown his head up… hell, when working out alongside of Ward, he was more about cutting up and freestyle rapping,, telling Ward they need to make a song. Ward told him he plays football…. Deion told EVERY player in Colorado that they had to “Earn their number” on day 1,,, but also said he’s coming with Shadeur as his QB…without having to earn it. He needs to separate himself from his dad…. And the Media needs to stop spotlighting Shadeur and making him a top story, as if he’s a bonified potential HOFer….. regardless what you think,, he needs to be humbled.. and all this media exposure is just inflating the ego. Shadeur was born on 3rd base, and thinks he hit a triple. Not necessarily his fault… he was placed in that situation by those around him. His dad has to leave him alone and be a coach on the field and a father off the field… not his Agent, Publicist, PR guy…. There should be Zero influence other than being Coach, coming from Deion when it comes to Shadeurs career
The Nepotism Football League doesn't exist.
I can’t believe he went unhinged like that
No team wants the circus and having the Prime Time Mouth of Deion Sanders second guessing every move they make in the media and on social media. Think about the NBA and Mello Ball and father and the circus that created
No one wants Dion as a part of the package deal.

Blackballing has no place in 2025 America
People making such a big deal out of this but its real simple.  Reports are that the Giants met with Sanders and gave him an install package and he wasn't prepared.  So they called him out and he got all butthurt and didnt like being called out.  They did not like his reaction because it shows he isn't coachable.  Add his father on top, who remember, literally told certain teams not to draft his son.. and they said "o.k then".  Add on to that the fact that Travis Hunter was helping his stats and he had a lot of check downs, under thrown balls that Hunter went up for...yeah.  Eisen is dead wrong here.  Sanders is not skilled enough for people to put up with him being a diva.  That simple.
Deion made it personal. The league is just showing the Sanders family who runs this s**t.

Joel you need deep self reflection.....or sued for defamation of character. The NFL needs to be sued for defamation of character.  Shedeur does not need to BEG!
No one can control the narrative when Deon Sanders is talking.
@7:35 that's the problem though. Shedeur AND Deion made it public from the very get-go. From Deion's "he'll go top 5 lolol" comment on Twitter in '24 to Shedeur's "come get me if you want me" attitude with the draft process. At that point, all bets are off and the NFL did right by sending them a message.  EDIT: And yes, Rich, Deion DOESN'T get credit for Travis' draft position because he was already highly touted coming out of high school. That speaks to the natural born talent that he had from the get-go.

After years of watching Rich he was floored for his friend. Creating the narrative that the league is dodging sanders and then getting mad about it was not a good look. He clearly made a bad impression to people and he had plenty of content of him trying to say he wasn’t a football player.
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
This is all about Deon and his family. They are too bright and the owners want to bring them down a notch.
LeBron did his best to get his son a job in the NBA. Shadeur doing his best to get his dad a job in the NFL.

Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
What the hell was Prime thinking, obviously the 💰 meant more than anything else, the cart before the horse, note to all quarterbacks, stay in school and take your reps, seasoning, whiskers
Rich is a real friend.  He stood on business for his friend's son.  Rich is a real one🫡.  The refused to join the smear campaign.
That man don’t need no self reflection anybody with eyes knows what this is. Won’t stop nothing the kid can ball period
He might be better than a few of the other QBs taken ahead of him, but with most other things being equal most teams just don’t want to put up with all of the other garbage.  I hope that he takes this as a wake up call because I’m not so sure that his old man has done him any favors.
Mercy for the young black and gifted. Thank you God;for everything.

C'mon, guys.  It's not rocket science.  His daddy is retiring his darn number and he's not even out of school yet, let alone did he really do anything to deserve it.  Give me a break!  Tim Tebow, arguably the greatest and most decorated college QB in the history of college football, doesn't even have his number retired yet.
The NFL let the Sanders family know his talent doesn’t give him an $&! Hole pass
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
They didn't say Baker Mayfield needed deep self reflection. And he got a DUI.
Thank you for the great content!
Keep the faith!
Rich being a baby, go listen to some of his interviews. Teams don’t want that drama. Watch what happens if he don’t start or has a bad game.  These supposed qb’s that went earlier played in better conferences. When sanders played top 25 teams he won 1.
Shadeur simply needs the team who prioritizes gold chains, diamond watches, exotic cars and top hype media coverage, he’s got this!

The Sander's family are loud, flashy, and drama.  Team's are investing millions and their franchise's legacy. He's NOT that special compared to other talented players who are humble. This whole college season, I had my fill of Sanders; father and son.  All the team's decisions can't be wrong.  It's the overall consensus of his behavior, attitude, and baggage.

No one wants Deion and his son’s drama
So you want him to beg, please take me. No sir, my talent speaks for itself. When you need a quarterback come holla at me. Show him a lesson, ridiculous. Hopes he proves the haters wrong

That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
There is A.  Rome, where Sanders struggles majorly in the NFL. Because he does not have a big arm. His play is mostly anticipation because he throws the ball rather slow. That is not good for an NFL quarterback. You need the ball to get to a spot very quickly before the defense can react. This is why Sanders fell so far. He does not have a big arm. It's not a laser rocket arm. It's a anticipation. I'll get there when I get there arm

And this is why the Browns are such a trash organization. Spend the third round draft. Pick on some random a** 6 round quarterback and in the fifth round. Pick another quarterback that they should have just picked in the third round. That way, they could have got a offensive lineman or a defensive lineman or a linebacker or somebody to help the f****** team.  My GM just so happens to find outstanding offensive linemen in the fifth and sixth round linemen that are so good. Their second contract makes them the highest paid lineman in the N. Go look at will fries from the colts. That is an every draft thing for my gym. He fand top elite quality offers alignment in the fifth and sixth round.

The kid showed up to interviews unprepared and entitled. It matches everything that we have heard about the kid and seen in post-game interviews. Stop the BS that there is an agenda. Rich just too emotional in this interview. Once emotional he is losing perspective. C’mon Rich be better.
I don't want him or his father on or around my team. Come on RICH, regardless of Deion's coaching, this is about demeanor and comparing Travis Hunter's demeanor to Sanders' is a false equivalency. I'm somewhat shocked Rich didn't bring up Rodgers🤣 "toe" mentality has destroyed many locker rooms.
Algorithm finally did something right

Seems possible that ESPN is just angry for being wrong for overhyping Sanders. A red flag QB is completely different than picking a red flag DL or CB. I think part of it might be injury. Holding the ball too long in college gets you sacked, holding onto the ball too long in the NFL gets your year ended possibly your career ended.

Coaches and owners don't want Deion trying to run the show. In my opinion, he blew his kids chances.
These are the "experts' that spent the past 3 months saying Shadeur would go in the first round. And what happened to all those 'inside sources' they all claim to have?
What a Dumbazz!!!!! Sheduer doesn't need to BEG any GM/TEAM for anything.  His TALENT speaks for itself, no need for him to "beg for a shot" he plays better than 4 QBs taken before him and the stats back it up, and they didnt have to "beg" to.come off the board!!!!
Talent Over Everything. And they think his talent isn’t worth the circus.
Quiet and humble huh? lol 😂 that’s the solution 🧐
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
I can t stop smiling watching this
No team wants Dione screaming at them "MY SON NEEDS TO BE A STARTER"
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
Quarterback is different? Really?… So what was Colin Kapernick, HELLO?!
Pure talent. No words
Rich, are you really that obtuse? I usually tend to agree with you. But maybe, just maybe, the level of social media chaos he will probably bring to whatever team decides to choose him could outweigh the positives. I mean, you were not in the rooms when teams interviewed him, none of us were. But for teams like the Steelers to pass on him has to tell you something. They're as desperate as any team can be for a quarterback, and Tomlin is as much of a players coach as can be, and THEY passed on him in the THIRD round???
Sheduer is a Brown! The dog pound gonna be a legit team in a couple years
Your videos are always so helpful, thank you!
Amazing content as always!
Deion said, “HE WOULD CHOOSE WHERE Shedeur WOULD GO PLAY”!
This gave me chills… in the best way
9:40 What was Brady’s talent level when drafted? If it’s like everyone but Rick says that where you are drafted is written in stone.
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
It's bigger than what y'all are saying , Think about it if Deion son can't get drafted to nfl why go play for him? He's not  good enough as a coach to get you to the next level. Didn't he get two top D1 QBs, Travis Hunter to flip. It's about making a man and his son look  like poor quality.  They played in his face. Where's fakearse Jerry, Tom Brady silent, and this  is pathetic I will not watch the NFL,,, Collin part 2 huh...modern day lynching.  But just a hot topic for tv ..NFL is trash.
Legendary
Algorithm finally did something right
Teams wanted a plain Shedeur sammich, but every time they ordered, it came with Deion sauce on it....  No team wants to constantly deal with a prima donna and his son.
If it's anyone's fault it's how he was raised lmao. Trust me 32 nfl teams who only  care about winning did not do this to teach him a lesson. He isn't good enough for the way he acts

Teams don't want the side show.  Seems pretty simple to me.
Very well done, appreciate this video!
Sanders potentially going undrafted is due to his unique situation where he has all of the red flags a player could have.   Overbearing daddy who happens to be a HOFer and coach with enormous platform and is known to be outspoken and controls behind the scenes. Piss poor attitude and labeled as uncoachable. Too flashy and will bring unwanted attention to inside  locker room and team if he doesn’t get what he wants (some of this is media driven and isn’t entirely his fault). And finally, the main reason he isn’t drafted… he just doesn’t have enough talent on tape or the potential for talent to overcome these red flags thus making him undrafted. If I’m a team like the browns and needs a qb I’ll take Dart over sanders any day. If sanders had even penix like talent he’d be drafted by now. It isn’t a race thing, he just happens to be black and have these red flags. If he was any other race he’d still be undrafted. Manzel was drafted bc he was literally a superstar coming out of college and you’d look stupid if you didn’t take him first overall. Sanders doesn’t have that same hype

Always nice to see an analyst not seeing his responsibility for a misjudgment. Sanders is far from the first Quarterback to be falling in the draft. Brady and Purdy come to mind and at the same there are QBs already in the league who were drafted early that don’t live up to where they were drafted.
This gave me chills… in the best way
Algorithm finally did something right
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
There's been far more talented players coming out of college that have declared for the draft without this level of arrogance and disrespect for the processes instituted to gauge the incoming players readiness for the NFL game. Him and his dad believe Shedur is above all of that, so the teams are making an example out of it.   Most teams in desperate need for a cornerstone QB saw the incoming repeat Ball family drama that was ahead and noped the f*ck outta that!😅
This was super helpful, thanks!
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
everyone can speculate but no one will ever come out and say the reason why he is not drafted. i believe this is a collective effort by the nfl teams. But i get it. BS, but i get it.
The "NFL" owes No player Nothing!! Humble yourself and Show RESPECT!! Regardless of Who your Father is!! This is a Well earned Lesson!!!
Shadeur could get undrafted if he doesn’t go in the 4th round.  I hope a talented franchise like the 49ers, Rams or Cardinals select him.
This gave me chills… in the best way
PRIME TIME is not bigger that NFL and that was the Sanders family problem
They are going to push sanders to be the next Brady.

Could this be the first time a player had his college jersey retired and not get drafted at the next level?

An overhyped narcissist with a famous narcissistic father who can't STFU takes a hard fall.  Will Shedeur learn some humility?  Probably not. Shedeur bought into what Daddy has been telling him since he was a small kid, & he showed that in the NFL interviews.  Add in Daddy discussing everything about what happens to him in the NFL on social media.  Another factor is many extremely successful college QBs flopped in the NFL, or never got drafted.

Could the fact that they retired his number at Colorado have been the tipping point for the league coaches and teams higher ups . That they don’t want to pick him ,and what comes with that
This fairy sanders kid only played 2 seasons correct? He needs more experience
Shedeur is just proof most people would rather date a 6 with the vibe of a 5 than a 7 who demands to be treated like a 10
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
You explained this so well, thank you!
60% of his completions were 1-5 yards. Out of 65 QBs he was 48th in completion % at 11.3. And 52nd in average air ypa with 7.4.
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
This gave me chills… in the best way
I ain’t calling nobody.
This right here is what the owners are upset about. '(Shedeur controls the narrative)' if they were smart, they'd realize the amount of wealth that can be negotiated from respecting that and genuinely bolstering it in a beneficial way. However, ego, pride and archaic mindsets wont allow you to arrive to that conclusion. shits such a hinder on evolution. (Mr. Sanders feel free to hire me as an advisor)
Well he wasn’t as good as people said for one I wouldn’t have drafted him over ward or Dart
I ve had this on repeat all day
My dumb 2 cents.  teams are thinking if we pick Him, We are picking His Dad as well.  Too much drama? Maybe?
SHEDEUR SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BEG.
The QB is your team leader and the face of your franchise…he’s not like any other position on the field. The handful of teams that might need a QB must’ve seen some red flags.
Proves NFL is against smart Black men.  From coaches to QBs
Sports media realizing their narrative pushing doesn't work. The dude just isn't that talented and his personality isn't worth his play.
When will we hear the.....R WORD, and WHO will say it?  I believe He is being passed over because teams don't want the noise his presence will bring. Teams rating of him notwithstanding sports media has a way of creating BS controversy simply to get people to pay attention to their show or podcast. Merely talking about how long it took to draft him will take on a life of it's own for qhomever picks him. Media will create problems for him even if him or Deion just stay quiet and go about the work.
Well, being a free agent isn't the worst thing they can pick who he wants to play for if they'll have them
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
Colts need pick him in the next round why not no qb1 in that building yet
I ve had this on repeat all day
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
5:55 i beg you? lol smh. dude please. its not that serious. he'll be good in life nfl or not.  i think the Sanders having a movie film crew film everything is part of the issue. tomlin use to snap on JuJu anytime he live streamed on social media. some teams dont want that type of energy behind their closed doors. ego has little to do with it. They said Caleb was a diva, had a Father who was heavily in his business, yet he still got drafted
Shedeur just gives a bad vibe and he seems to put a lot of effort into projecting that bad vibe 24/7.   It's different if you're Deion and the best corner in the league, not the face of the team.
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you

Some people, organization, companies don't feel comfortable dealing with strong personalities, especially if they are well known and popular, unfortunately this is the case with the Sanders family and I personally like Deion Sanders strong and confident personality, he's intelligent,funny and determent, and he wants what he believes to be best for his family.🎉
Sanders doesn't do drugs or alcohol nfl is about power starting to look more like Hollywood makes me mad get'em rich been watching you for a long time
He couldn’t social media hype himself to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd round. Speaks volumes.
I can t stop smiling watching this
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Espn, cnn, msnbc all  just make up narratives and are the same
I love deion but hes the lavar ball of the NFL. Shedeur has talent but a lot of teams dont want what he brings with him and thats his dad. He needs to separate himself from that and make it know to teams that hes here to work hard and be humble. His dad arguing w fans online and his camp acting like the nfl owes them a QB spot is not helping him. Im pretty sure the nfl got together and decided no one is going to draft him just like they did woth colin kaepernick
No team wants an entitled arrogant cocky selfish player… it’s not good for a team   Generally speaking

I feel like it’s not a hard thing to grasp. People are saying it’s disgusting and unbelievable when really what it is that there’s a bunch of teams without a need and any with the need ain’t like what they saw at some point and collectively, but not jointly, decided they didn’t want him. There’s nothing wrong with that, chips just fell how they did there’s nothing disgusting about it. I think the conversations right now are pitiful.
Dude is trying so hard to protect this kids image lol.
Can S Sanders unretire and go back to Colorado? Work your butt off to get 1st rd pick in 2026
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!

Does Eisen have money on the over/under on shedur’s draft position? He said himself; “if you draft me, you have to draft my brother.” And  Deion telling the league he won’t let some teams draft shedur! The drama is exhausting!  I am tired of hearing about the sanders family drama…. 🎉
I ve had this on repeat all day
It’s not drafting a player, it’s drafting a family and drafting the noose and distraction.

Shadeur doesn't need to call a GM. be true to oneself. You think a phone call would change anything? Nope!
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
Why won't these people just consider that maybe he wasn't up to snuff talent wise? Tons of teams have taken qb with character issues. And teams have taken qbs who are "winners", Tebow who looked good and then absolutely bombed in the nfl because they saw that he simply wasn't good enough. I'm not saying this is a fact, but why is it a given that it's just everyone not liking his character? Do we know honestly know his talent is up to snuff?
Guy next to Rich should do some serious self-reflection about why no one knows who the hell he is
HERE IS THE ANSWER!!!!! L-E-T I-T G-O!!!!!!! Just because his last name is Sanders??? Let It Go!!!!!!!!

What about Jonny mazele rich is right nfl bs
Self reflection 😂😂😂😂😂 they silly af
Travis Hunter was seen as a phenomenal player. He won the Heisman. And, no one was saying that he would not go to certain teams.shedur has only had his father as his coach. Part of that is that he is not accustomed to having to win over an authority figure. His dad may have coached him hard, but he didn't have to convince his dad to make him the starter or to put him on the team. This is a new experience for him. Just my opinion.
The factthat the Sanders undrafted  drama is sucking the air out of the draft. If this doesn't tell you everything you need to know I don't know what does. If Shedeur wants to really play ball he needs to distance himself from his dad
Glorified slave trading. And oh, by the way, need I remind these prognosticators Tom Brady wasn't taken until the 6th round, stop crying and show the world what ya got.
He's just not good. Stop with the long winded bs. He's not a starting qb in the nfl.
Who else is here before this blows up
I think sanders interviews must’ve not gone well, on top of that a lot of teams don’t need QBs or aren’t looking for a backup who’s going to get more hype than the rest of the team. You also have to wonder how good sanders really would be if he didn’t have Travis hunter, and would he even had a starting QB position in college if it weren’t for his dad? I think he would but the fact that he’s had his dad as coach for his entire life until the NFL and has never really had to beat another high rated QB for a position makes him questionable. I mean he’s put in work don’t get me wrong but you also can’t say he hasn’t gotten in the position he’s been without the sole help of his daddy. There’s always going to be a stigma about the coaches son, so what did he expect.

Let's see how he deals with adversity.
Maybe the NFL isn't made for Daddy ball
Hey now we’ll be able to see what Shadeur is really made of now.  Hopefully he’s given a chance and is able to produce
Eisen,no clue as usually, number one,number 2,Dion,he not playing for this team or that team,number 3,should he have been drafted by now,yes,but is he going to be a great NFL QB,not even close,has arena football written all over it,maybe Canada, which is not a bad move,beats 9-5. ✌️
No excuse for Miami to not get shader in the 4th if he is there. Tired of relying on Tua health. Miami got 3 picks in the 4th. They better get him if he is available.
I think no team wants deal with his attitude and his father
Shedeur comes with too much family drama
It’s completely clear: nobody wants to have that level of drama in their locker room.

Maybe, just maybe it might be all the time he has been on social media. Maybe just maybe they saw things they did not like in his leadership of a multi billion dollar organization, maybe there were red flags off the football field. Who knows? Maybe when looked at by experts he is not that good. Maybe interviews were terrible.

Go to the Canadian Football League and ball out
The problem with Sanders is now you get daddy in the locker room every game. It’s worse than Swift at KC games.

If teams thought Sanders was Peyton Manning, he would’ve been drafted already. It’s that simple
I’m confuse is it about football or the owner’s personal issues
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
Just like Kyler Murray, insanely overrated All the other teams have learned from the Cardinals mistake, All flash no substance
to me, shedeur sanders will be a very good fit with any nfl teams. he will do it on his own terms as a responsible adult and as long as he is willing to learn and be coached. eventually, an nfl team will give him a chance to prove his worth. maybe, the las vegas raiders? only time will tell.
It's the CIRCUS atmosphere, and teams don't want to deal with it !

Little do they know waaay more people support this young man now because of this. I’m buying his jersey asap wherever he goes
The recent fiasco for the Jets with a high profile QB who felt he was more important than the team has to be a cautionary tale for other teams.
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
I believe it's because they don't want to go through another Eli Manning situation. He got drafted to a team that he didn't want to go to and his family didn't want him to go to so they made a big deal to get traded
Yeah Rich, the league takes people with red flages in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th round because the general public will move on and forget about the player. No one want the Sanders Media Circus. And part of that is the media fault. So espn and the NFL should blame themselves
Another "And I took that personally" meme is in the works as we speak
Teams don't want the Sanders Circus 🎪
If you think Rich is biased, that mean YOU think Gabriel>Sanders ie YOU are biased
Great job, this video was very useful!
I FIGURED IT OUT! Jerry and Dallas told the NFL to not draft him until their picks later in the draft! Watch 😂😂. Only plausible option atp lol

There is no deep reflection needed.. This is collusion to teach a lesson for no reason.  What is the real issue, his family put together a great marketing machine?  He always performs, respected by teammates, no off the field issues, there is absolutely nothing of substance they can say to why they are doing this to this young man.
Algorithm finally did something right
The lengths to which four grown men will go on a nationwide broadcast to humiliate themselves over Kaepernick 2.0 is astonishing. This the owners actively refusing to improve their teams because they can’t deal with Prime or dont want to which is a point to discuss but these four are close to tears with Eisen letting Ron Burgundy cut him off immediately. During the Kaepernick saga and admittedly he was no Shedeur the owners cried about the social justice friction then discovered they had alienated the black fans and went 180 because in truth they would sell their own mothers to turn a buck. This is the fruit of the idiotic conflation of the NFL with patriotism. MLB fams and commentators are passionate but you would never in a million years see this type of melodrama play out over a single player even in this reductive era of bat flips, clocks, let the kids play etc. which still cant ruin the best game of all. Its MLB season again with over 2500 games if you can conceive of that. Last year the Giants alone had over 2.5 million fans in attendance at home. For me the NFL cant even come close.
This is what you get for running your mouth “there’s select teams we’re willing to play for”. At this rate the kid may very well go undrafted 😂
This is funny. Call and beg now. Hell no. But you should’ve been humble from the get go. This is not MMA and you’re not Conor McCregor. This is a team sport. Nobody likes guys that act like that.
Its simple. No coach wants to deal with Deion. Its not about Shedeur.
His daddy went and doomed him by putting his son on a pedestal thinking he is gods answer to the NFL.His son isn't that good and daddy screwed him
Shout out to Rich and Charles. I don't like the way these other cats talking up there.
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
I quote the father ( imo a loud mouth narcissistic ego maniac just like trump) his son would go " Top 5". Day 1 no , Day 2 no and yes the NFL is sending a message the son is not that good and the baggage is too heavy. But hey Sheduer will still have his Bentley car and all the Hip Hop parties to attend.
At this point it’s become more of a story since he hasn’t been drafted. If the NFL owners didn’t want cameras and social media involved then someone should’ve taken him in round 2. Now everyone is going to be interested in whatever team drafts him. Theres going to be even more news and social media involved
NFL Media freaking out over a player that couldnt hang with Top 25 teams in college, barely kept CU above .500 and has Deion in his ear at all times. No one wants a loud backup QB media corcus
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
I ve had this on repeat all day
As desperate as teams are for a QB, dude musta said some sh*t in those interviews.
It appears based on news reports,Deion Sanders told certain NFL teams he did not want his son to play for them or he has concerns about their organization, team environment,so it appears this is why teams are reluctant to draft his son.This is what happens when you have a controlling father and Mother making decisions for their offspring future, sometimes it backfire.😢
Media over hyped him too
Would love to. Hear what daddy has to say!
Eisner very emotional about this! Taking it very personally 😂
Shedeur sucks
Be who you can afford to be, if Shadeur set the NCAA on fire and won the Heisman this would be a non-issue. He is a distraction and was afforded the luxury of the best 2-way player in college and the team was mediocre at best, he has explosive play potential but he is not what teams in the NFL look for in a franchise QB or even a backup QB.

Thank you Rich for not apologizing for the NFL.  This is obviously not an indictment on talent, it is personal, and I'm not sure what he as young man has done to deserve this.  But the reality is what it is, hopefully this can make him stronger.

I mean it doesnt help that shadeur declined meetings with teams outside the top 5.  Or that he shows up in interviews wearing 100K chains.  Tiki Barber was saying yesterday that he thinks that teams think shadeur has no "grind" to him to succeed.  hes already rich, hes already been paid so he might not show out for teams. Like he thinks hes pretty good at the game so he can just show up and have everything handed to him.  but i dunno.  its quite the story of the draft.

Basically they're saying he has to beg to get in the NFL
100% this is a message to Deion
Rich, you couldn’t be further from reality. You’ve drank the cool aid.
I wouldn’t reach out to anybody, he works hard and plays hard and is doing nothing differently than anybody else.
In the end the NFL doesn’t think he’s that good. That’s it. And honestly I can totally see this dude be arrogant in the meeting because he’s been listening to media and drinking the kool aid. And in the end teams thought the talent didn’t match the red flags.

Now on to Shedeur Sanders, NFL organizations aren't trying to deal with the Shedeur & Deion Sanders circus that will bombard their franchise. If Shedeur Sanders is not starting, the rumbles will start for him to start immediately, and if he doesn't play good than the Deion Sanders lunatics will start to say they need to hire Coach Prime as said team next NFL Head Coach. Remember this, NO ONE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NFL SHIELD 🏈🛡

He should be begging.
They always trying to humble the black man
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Plus and minus. The Sanders name is a plus and minus. Rough on that kid. Because he certainly is a good person. God bless this young man.
Shader isn’t that good to begin with and with the an nepo baby approach he has doesn’t help. He wants the credit his dad worked to deserve.

He’s going to the Raiders drafted or not. Book it. Brady is his mentor. While they talking about Shaduer fire works of Brady lit up. They would have similar story of being drafted late or undrafted.  I think he’s going to the Raiders drafted
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Relationships matter!
Sanders has the 16th highest QBR.  He isn’t as good as he and his dad think he is.
Needs to go undrafted. He can do the ''i wanna be a prefered walkon " with his select prefered choice of teams. Only to find there is none.
NFL teams dont want someone cocky like Shedeur, they want someone humble and non-controversial like Deshaun Watson...
Shedeur is going to be undrafted. This is a collective decision from owners
I wouldn’t be interested in him due to his attitude, arrogance and refusal to participate in draft/team workouts. And honestly I don’t want to deal with “Prime Time” that’s me though I’m old school sounds like his interviews really went poorly. Eisen is being a homer here
It’s very personal cameras is straight B.S
Who else is here before this blows up

Did he just ask this brother to BEG? Did he just say the quiet part loud??? Smh
It’s called COLLUSION  Ask Kaepernick about it 😮
The "experts" on the outside looking in can't admit their mistake, obviously the real experts in NFL scouting believe Sanders is not starting quarterback talented. Good, but not elite. A project.

When picking players ALWAYS CONSIDER THE TALENT, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY CHARACTER, THE PERSON, THE ATTITUDE THE DRIVE, THE DETERMINATION, where all those attributes checked idk you would have to ask Teams...is being related a NFL star a legend have anything to do with it MAYBE IDK. Could some teams be thinking lets give a kid who didnt have the money the string's to pull maybe..but i see people saying that they didn't want to play for certain teams i think i can assume they FU to them regardless of talent.. And they don't want the drama, They don't want the added pressure to a player because of his father which is something very possible, not everyone hits the professional level and can handle it.
This is ridiculous.. why is everyone making the draft about this dude?? He’s prime times kid! That’s all he’s done.. what exactly has he won? Maybe the scouts see something negative?? Tom Brady went in the 6th round.. Kurt Warner wasn’t drafted? Are they going to make this a racial thing? Or an ability and character thing? Anyone? Somebody else find all of this as over dramatic? 😳
BS! We all know why Sanders is getting snubbed. It’s because his openness about being a faithful Christian. As soon as Tua started talking about his faith the league and media started trying to destroy him. The league and media are completely uncomfortable with Christians. However, they are completely okay with spouse abusers, criminals, and drug and alcohol abusers. Please, we all know what this is about
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
And just in case no one getsIT the Luggage is DEION ,and more than likely teams DONT WANT HIM IN THIER LOCKER ROOM ,there that’s the luggage 😂
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
Hahaha Colin kap v2….. blackballed before he played a down
Look guys, you cannot create the kind of drama that he Sander's family has created and think that any organization would want to deal with that kind of smoke.

Rich keeps scolding his panel about Shedeur needing to reflect & humble himself, “HE CAN PLAY!” Rich doesn’t get it. It’s not Shedeur’s talent. It’s about whether he can fit into a team’s culture, no matter what role he’s given.
Ravens draft Shedeur Sanders. Sit and learn behind Lamar for 4/5 years. Harbaugh retires, Monken takes over. Lamar retires, Shedeur takes over.  Ravens are defense first, run second. Monken brings the passing element. Defense is returning back to form. Backs are always going to come to Baltimore. & Likely, Flowers & Bateman should still be around.

sanders daddy has to be coach too
One of the messages the NFL tries to send to American citizens is, the owners own you. Keep your mouth shut and make them money or else.

I need some answers…. Why wasn’t this guy picked up…. I’m a colts fan and wish colts picked him up for more competition
No team in the league wants coach a guy that will be being coached by his father at the same time.

So shuck and jive and beg...? ok
8:45 oh by the way it didn't really help that deion Sanders cussed out a coach at Colorado's pro day. They also probably don't want to see Dionne tweeting about they ain't playing my son or he ain't getting enough playing time or blame the line for not protecting his son. No team wants to deal with that f****** s*** week to week when they got a f****** season to deal with

This whole segment is stupid
It’s obvious they think Deion and his son  are  not worth it, despite the talent, because of the headache that would accompany it. Not saying that’s true, but they definitely don’t want the  Sanders branding.
Rich can clutch pearls all he wants, people don't like Sheduer and no one has to have an excuse as to why. It is what it is.

When you purposely in a nasty way try to teach somebody a lesson the message is lost it has the reverse affect.
esBn seemed to be the only ones who thought sanders was a no,1 ,guess what they were WRONG again ,I’m still waiting for Ryan Clark to cry racism 😂
A legacy black talent with a brand already built and going that extends beyond football is being sent a message. there isn’t enough for the NFL to get out of him monetarily. Don’t back down, Shedeur. Lean on family and trust 21.
3:03 we see who's helping out with the agenda. "Qb is different"?!  Yeah, we've seen plenty of braggadocious and confident and also toxic qbs go 1st pick and top 10. Come on, lame af narrative
Let's get Shannon Sharp on and ask his opinion next
Rich you seem to be taking this very personally bro 😂😂😂😂😂I 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wanted to be a professional nfl player, then I found out you can be fired for getting an hj from a massage therapist. Whats the point
This is like the mainstream media trying to convince the Country Kamala Harris would be a good president.
Tell em, Rich!
Steelers always get the deals they will pick him up if Roger's doesn't come
The NFL does Sanders dirty and Daniel Jones is still working is nasty work. Just seems like it's more going on with him. You're telling me he isn't even a third rd pick?
His personality is nowhere near as bad as the dude from Tennessee, and he was drafted. Its his lack of talent and bad interviews.  Whats so hard to accept about that?
He shouldn't have to reach out to GM's and beg to be picked. That's crazy lol
Everyone is forgetting that no coach wants to draft Shedeur, and have Deion Sanders waiting for you to struggle so he can take your job.
Rich, I love you and enjoy everything you do. But I have to say the way this draft has been narrated is a total insult to every player drafted who is not Shadeur Sanders. After EVERY pick, the comment is about Shadeur. Take the time to celebrate the ones who ARE getting drafted. Creating and prolonging the drama over Shadeur is nauseating. He has taken over Aaron Rodgers role. Enough already.
America has to protect egos of idiots that may be offended
So when Elway and manning did this why weren’t they treated like this?
NFL teams don't want distractions coming from everywhere all the time for a player that in their vision is not a lock top tier qb.
Klatt hit it when he said ".....but Quarterback is different"
The fatigue IS REAL.
Shedeur has deficits - like holding the ball too long and getting whacked.   He took a beating at Colorado.   Thus, the potentially of being rag-dolled in the NFL   His pocket presence is not good.   Although he played with Travis Hunter, a mediocre+ BYU team ran them out of the Alamo Bowl.   In addition, teams are running away from the Coach Prime distraction.  What's so hard to figure out??   Against the stiffs, Coach Prime's team does well.   Against good competition, they generally suck.  And it will get worse.
Who is the dummy opposite Rich on the end. Now we know the source.
Some team that isn't going to play their star QB in preseason should draft him and let him tear up preseason and trade him for a bunch of picks.
When your drama outweighs your abilities
Colin 2.0
The question is, will he be drafted at all?
in short, the scouts made their decisions
He has average talent with above average ego. We will pass😂
The NFL is blackballing him. It’s just not right.
RIch is a normally pretty reserved, but he along with many others are sick of the BS this is turning out to be. Personally, i think Shheduer shoulda been picked by now, but to make the ENTIRE draft about HIM??? pathetic, i hate the narrative. Let's celebrate everyone else rather than cry about why 1 person hasnt been drafted yet
That young mans over rated father { prime } has done this to his son.
I think it’s a conspiracy of the team owners to stop players from telling certain teams not to draft them.
Good get humbled.....😂😂
Ravens going to pick him up…
They needed to have stopped all that bragging showing off at Colorado talking about what teams they going to pay for in the NFL people don't want that drama and then all Dion he think he going to be criticizing the team that he do go to people don't want to deal with that trash
Maybe the owners are finally waking up the fact that distraction is a problem to having success. These days NFL players who have not won big in the NFL are on commercials, social media, podcasts, and not focusing on winning football games. This young man is unfortunately exactly there before even getting into the NFL. His blessing and curse is his father and his legacy.
Dude say Sanders should beg for somebody to draft him because of his fame…. I ain’t hear them tell Johnny Manziel to do that…
This is white supremacist buck breaking. It's wrong. It's collusion
It will be cool to see Shedeur clean up in the CFL...Memories of Warren Moon
That’s some BS, that young man should not have call and beg anyone. His talent surpasses several people that have already been picked before him.
Rich is the 2nd best, 2nd most honest dude in the game (Ernie Johnson is the goat)…but his cognitive dissonance about Shedeur can only be chalked up to love and loyalty. It is what it is.
10:49 your literally saying HE HAS TO BEG!
Eisen time to retire… your personal interests and Samders relationship doesn’t match reality.
Thanks for being honest Rich. Everybody else at this desk is acting like it’s not what it is.
Are NFL programs watching the Nico situation and skeptical about Deion trying to be hands on?
His dad and him should have stopped talking about what teams he would play for you go where they take you at
the stats and mechanics scream mediocrity, plus he probably bombed several interviews. I don't understand why everyone in the media was hyping him up to be this elite QB (probably just because name brand).   For those saying that it's due to race, look at who was taken first overall (Cam Ward). This is not Warren Moon 2.0. I am kinda surprised that he's fallen outside the first 2 days, but I can understand why teams don't want to deal with him because nobody wants a backup quarterback that's going to bring in a media circus.
Shauder should NOT BEG!!
He likes to blame his teammates for his bad games. No team needs that crap
He coming home to Dallas !
I been saying forever- sanders was super super overrated, he started because his dad was the coach - even those throws they showed as his highlights were mostly luck and he had happy feet in all of them
If Deion and the kid want to know why he has not been drafted all they need to do is look in the mirror.  Yep, there it is.  NFL teams don't want to deal with either of them.
My thought is that a coach doesn’t want to have Deion Sanders hanging over his head. I imagine an interview after a bad game and someone asks Deion he says “he just need the right coach” and it’s him trying to get the coach’s job.
I can understand a team not wantin to take him as a backup
Rich - C'mon man. You know that no 'velvet rope' or veteran in the locker room or coach or GM is going to be able to control his dad saying this or that in the media. Who wants to even think about dealing with that? The only teams I think might consider him at this point are those with Tier 1 QBs, uber-secure and strong alpha coaches and GMs in high-functioning franchises. All 32 teams have said, 'the talent isn't worth the package deal.' Brady hasn't pitched for him in Vegas? Tomlin and the Steelers? Like, the signs are there. All that said, this could be the best thing in the world for Shedeur Sanders' long-term career aspirations.
I see you Joel Klatt, at the 1:35 mark, standing up for the NFL franchises/privilege, that Shedeur Sanders should do 'some deep reflection'.  Ninja please!  The kid is getting a raw deal.  He's paying for the 'sins of the father'.  And most franchises don't want to deal with him.  BTW, my hats off to Rich Eisen for pushing back on this narrative.
Ya'll don't see it... DEION SANDERS has NFL head coaching aspirations. Any team that picks Shadeur DEION coming behind him with his LOUIS LUGGAGE and will take the Head Coaching Job... Picking Shaduer Sanders is an INSTANT Hot Seat for the HEAD COACH.
I am not sold on Shadeur, but cmon, he’s better than most the qbs in last years playoffs. There has got to her a problem on his wonderlic, attitude or interviews. Sure he ill be demanding in negotiations, but even saintly Peyton Manning played hardball as to where he was going to play . Rich is correct. I don’t think league office has that much influence on team owners who are arrogant and strong willed. I am actually gonna be rooting for this now underdog. Unless h goes full ghetto on social media.
its personal, if it was talent  he would have been drafted. This reminds me of Randall Cunningham, when they try to label him "to stay in the pocket" when his best plays was on the run that was his gift. Years later enter Michael Vick then every NFL team wanted a player with Vick like characteristics all of that came from Randall. Its like Shedeur is a head of his time and the league don't know how to handle it.
I am so tired of hearing rich talk about this kid. I had guessed he would get picked in the 5th
6:03 DID JOHNNY MANZIEL HAVE TO BEG?! Or did Baker Mayfield? WHO had an active police chasing video attached to his draft tape.
This is personal! Sheduer has not done anything not to be drafted. When he is drafted Sheduer is going to show up and show out! He how laughs first will laugh last!
I heard ONE Draft analyst.....heard him in the car , didn't catch his name. He had Sanders going anywhere from Rd 3 - 5.  The other "experts" with him acted stunned , disbelieve that the guy said this. He was right , Sanders is not a top-level prospect.  Never has been. These "experts" are just lackeys who don't want to anger Deion by saying his kid is overrated.
No to divas
I dunno. SOMEBODY was throwing Travis Hunter the ball.
Sanders is WAY too much like his dad....it worked for Dion because he did ONE thing...locked down the other team's best receiver....it's a whole nother ballgame when you're supposed to be the leader of the team at the QB position.
Teams don't want to deal with his daddy.
I agree with Rich here all the way
There will always be a reason not to draft a Black QB.
Rich is too close with Deion.  Deion was a great player, a good man.  He is the definition of a domineering father.  You can see it in his interactions with his kids.  He is also a narcissist but given his success, I'd probably the same.    This is clearly a condemnation of his family and something about Shedeur's personality.  No way Milroe and Gabriel are better QBs, just no way.  Tyler Shough? 7 years in the NCAA with ONE full season,
I think its 😢personality of the Sanders family because it can't be for disciplinary issues. Some groups of people will always look at black people sideways as opposed to say the manning family, just sayin. It is what it is
Homie telling Sanders to say he'd not being the circus. Nobody would believe that for a second. The Sander family is 100% about the circus. Shedeur isn't talented enough for teams to ignore the sideshow. There is no humility there. Hunter is talented enough to overcome his Dad's personality.
Geez, can the NFL Network and ESPN please stop moaning and groaning that Shedeur still hasn’t been drafted!! I mean these “Broadcasters” sound pathetic and are making Shedeur sound like he’s home crying.
Rich isn't wrong...
This man basically told Shedeur .. you need to shine shoes.. crazy
So your advice is to call the teams and lie. There's NO WAY he's going to swallow his ego now and beg after acting like he owned the teams
Shedur will be good i do believe , he will make teams regret not drafting him
Dude right... gotta make some calls now bruh
I just hope Shadur doesn’t bring his knife to the draft 💯⛳️👌🇺🇸
Eisen is quickly losing perspective, thus credibility.....but that has been happening for a while.
The point being missed is we are at point in the draft where one team that decided to wait for a qb is about to get a 1st round talent in the 4th or 5th round
Can somebody tell me who these guys are, from left to right? Last night was my first time watching and I like them.💯💯💯💯
I like Deion and family but they have some of the WORST, most toxic fans on the internet. I wouldn’t want those nutjobs attacking my coaching staff and organization every time I made a decision they don’t like, or blaming me when Shedeur played bad like I can control his on field play/decisions.
Joel Clad was praising and supporting Shedeur all through the off season, claiming the was very talented amazing and was going to be one of the top 3 picks in the draft, but now he is tongue-tied when it comes to Sanders he doesn't  even know what to really say, but won't say what he was saying about the kid before, this is really crazy, but they all know what is going on even though they refuse to tell it.
Stop this.  Sanders was not an elite talent athletically. He did not play against elite talent. Did not attend the pre-draft processes such as the Shrine Bowl and was mid in his pro-day. At best he was a third round pick.   The media were salivating over the "Prime" content they wanted to be able to hustle for the next couple of years and are pissed because NFL teams that need wins more than clicks said "no" to Sanders.  Period. Move along citizens.
Okay brag coming in here. I'm not some genius or anything but I have a weird nack for QB analysis and prediction. Noteable predictions I've made recently while the player was in college...  Brock Purdy will be a Superbowl QB (while he was at Iowa State and after he was drafted). Burrow will be a top 5 QB and go to the Superbowl. Jalen will be okay but go to s Superbowl. Stroud will be better than young. Jalen will be the best QB in the class and Caleb will have a bad year (I said he would be benched in 5 years). I said Lamar and Allen while they were in college would be NFL stars that wouldn't do much in the playoffs. Idk what it is but I can just see these things and have only missed one prediction ever (I said Sam Bradford would be a star QB).  But I am here to say before the draft I said that Sanders would be terrible in the NFL. I said on draftday he would heavily fall and then if he ever started it would be for one year but mostly he would be a story that travels to different teams. Mark it
Rich Eisen knows the WHY but is not capable of speaking truth!
When he get picked, if he gets picked, the narrative will change that this was all planned somehow. The sanders family will flip the story. Watch.
Let me push back on all this. I believe the owners are making a statement for the simple fact that Mr. Sanders said he didn’t wanna play for certain teams. It’s not like that in the NBA in the NHL you get drafted by the team that needs you, regardless of how you feel just be lucky that you got drafted himself stating that he didn’t want to pay for those certain teams might’ve had those owners call each other and figured they had enough of college players dictating where they can and cannot go in the NFL
Is maye any better than will levis? Vrabel gonna rum him in the ground just like titans.
Diva
Sanders can always play in the CFL if he wants to start !
All this talk about talent as if the NFL isn’t full of talented players is BS!
Shedeur cocky mentality is causing him haha. He won’t even be top 40 qb in the nfl meaning he is a back up
3:09 so you cut him off to make a dumb point on a fly. Yea there’s an agenda
Shedeur Sanders created a brand for himself the same way Johnny Manziel and others have.
5:35 - unfortunately, this is not the way the Sanders operate. When things go right, they are frontrunners. When things go wrong, it's everyone else's fault and we are all just haters. Imagine being a young coach or GM constantly worried about that. Teams don't want to deal with the Deion Sanders circus
He's no better than Antonio Brown
I am loving this. Teams don't want the Sanders Family Circus and its ring leader, Prime Ego, contaminating their city. This is funny as hell.
Why is the media hell bent on destroying this young man’s professional draft? It seems personal to me- I’ve never seen anything like it- entitled athletes have been around for decades there must be some other reason- it’s weird- I hope Shedur has an all pro career
Hell no he is not going to beg
Teams, Owners. GM's, and coaches, have the right to pick whomever they want on their team...... regardless of what Mel Kiper thinks
Man… this is some privileged  nonsense.  Every player comes with some type of baggage.  Your talent has to outweigh your baggage.  If the talent was there a team would sign I guy with say… dozens of sexual assault allegations pending.  The talent wasn’t commensurate with the cost. Simple math.
Schadenfreude... look that up.
It’s going past 2nd round why should he be humble…expose the hypocrisy this is BS!
NO Coach in the NFL is gonna draft the son of their future replacement get ready 2 c Shedur go undrafted! 😂😢
They all know
If I'm him I'm not begging anyone nor am i talking. Someone will call. When I show up, I'm on a mission to shut everyone up. Let them eat the humble pie.
Drafting Shadeur Sanders is drafting the top candidate to replace your current head coach because there is no better coach to “fix” Shadeur than his father.   No coach wants to draft their own replacement.
Come on Rich!!! Tell the truth!! This league will take abusers, users, and r*pist, but a young black man with confidence is to much. Man please!!
It's an interview. He blew the interview, it's not that hard to understand
If I'm a coach or an owner or a GM, I don't ever ever EVER want Deion talking publicly about the way my team is using Shedeur, what his role is, asking why he's not starting, etc.  No way, no how, would I ever allow any possibility of that happening.
Only the "experts" are surprised 😂. Everyone else in the fan bases and front offices all know the same thing- Shedeur isn't a top talent and he's a locker room problem. There is no reason to waste a value pick on him.
It's because of the circus show that comes along with it 💯 it's because teens don't want that distraction of his father. More than likely
I think that retiring his jersey at Colorado was the straw that broke the camels back for a lot of teams.
Nobody wants a child with a HOF daddy's swagger who has never stepped foot on a pro field. Maybe the whole Legendary look and skipping the combine wasn't a good look.
Any prospective employee who doesn’t think bosses talk to each other, across an entire industry, is incredibly naive.
The PROBLEM is his DAD!  He's going to interfere w/ coaching. Dad doesn't want sign the STAY the FCK OUT Agreement!
Oh, everyone knows THE ANSWER, but nobody wants to say it out loud.
How on earth could my New Orleans Saints have passed on Sanders??? Wow
Can we talk about literally anything else. The entire draft is: Giants draft XXX, can't believe Shadeur hasnt been drafted. Titans draft XXX, Shadeur is definitely a better value at this spot. Saints draft XXX, wow they didnt go Shadeur.  He's a toxic person thats mediocre at best, talk about the talent getting drafted and not as a segue to Shadeur.
No team wants to deal sanders sideshow that will include his dad constantly being in camera critiquing a team and coaches use of him. You can bet that’s what’s steering them clear of him. Locker distraction all the way
Dude on the left is a total clown
It's not him it's the circus coming with him... they don't want deion there on the sidelines yelling at the head coach questioning every play...
What round was Tom Brady drafted in? What’s the big deal?
I aint seen anything this scummy out of the shield since Kaepernick
It is personal. Whether it’s out of spite or from his own supposed doing.
Now this is prime time!
These guys did not watch Shedeur's 1st dayvdraft party. Guy is worried about playing HIS music in the the locker room. Legendary $ my butt. Kid is no leader of men.
Just like on the street. When tough guy Deion flexed in the faces of the billionaire men's club, their reaction  was as expected, to knock Deion tf  out cold. The League is the same as the street! Sometimes, you find out you are nothing.
Klatt's arguments of a backup is making 0 sense. He has a first round grade. That's never a perceived backup. What is this guy talking about?
Chiefs should take him and have sit behind Patty and learn from him and Andy. Andy can deflect any attention that might come with him.
Why is this draft all about Shedeur? He’s no generational talent…
@5:34 …. So you want him to beg and plead with the GMs and leauge to be a part of it. Fuk what he did to prove himself to be a draft pick. He need to plead and beg to get in… So like we said, they don’t like he confident, black and knows his worth. This is about breaking him.
Klatt pick a side and stay there rich was the obit one that told the truth here. Position does not matter!!! If you do wrong you do wrong they aren’t gonna give you less time because you’re a QB. That’s like saying Aron Hernandez would have been just fine if he were a QB. Like get tf outta here this is sabotage at its finest.
rich , come on , its clear , probably better for him to go undrafted and choose the team
This has nothing to do with Shedeur. Powerful people hated Deion on how he's shaking the college football. This is 32 owners getting together giving Prime the finger.
The life lesson here is to be humble. Sanders attitude and cockiness is a big reason he hasn’t been drafted yet
I love Rich, but he's gotta stop fan boying over Sanders because he's close to Dieon.
I suspect the Raiders might draft Legendary #2 (L2) due to Tom Brady (Raiders Co-owner) having personally coached L2 some time ago. Stay tuned, y'all.
Rich Eisen acts as though he knows better than 32 gms and their staffs ,get over it rich  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Well I guess the league are done with DEI QB’S too expensive.
Rich is the only one challenging the system. Everybody else is not trying to lose their career and connections. Sad how this world works.
For those of you who are uncomfortable with bringing race into it, ask yourself why no one decided to 'humble' Manziel or Mayfield. And why it's only black players that are 'humbled'.   Then ask yourself why there's a need to put a black player 'in their place'. 😂
This is personal. The league got together and decided to do this.
The Sanders family isn't calling anybody and they're not begging any team. They are who they are, and I'm very proud of them. Regardless of whatever happens, Shedeur is already rich and successful in life and that's better than being in the NFL. And if he does get into the NFL he's going to be their on his own terms. Mark my words.
These guys made some solid points. And to his point, you have to judge a QB differently. ITs the MOST important position. Good take
Somebody keep an eye on Rich, he seems to be taking this a little hard.....
God do not like ugly he see everything no matter how much you try to twist the story and I still love every last one of you guys
James Pearce got drafted first round and had reports from his coaches about being selfish not listening to his coaches, doing his own thang, etc.   I don’t want to hear that it’s his personality
Its an illegal blacklisting. Regardless of what you think of him. He should've been drafted by now
ALL he had to do was beat 4-6 Kansas for a trip to the BIG 12 championship game, and a shot at a National Title....and got embarrassed.
I don't know what he could have possibly said in these interviews for him to have to self reflect and grovel in front of these execs. These guys sound like they want him to beg for a job. Sounds like buck breaking to me.
You want the black man to beg? WTF?
He needs to  deep self reflect on  what? get out here with that B.S narrative if he was someone else different face we wouldn't be hearing this 💯 percent and then to tell him to beg f outta here only bow to Jesus
Rich embarrassing himself right now.
The NFL doesn't want the NBA's ratings.
Amazing how much time you wasted talking about him. The only one who looks more foolish is Kiper Jr.
2:52 That PART!
I see a lawsuit coming against the NFL
Eisen really butt hurt about Shedeur. 😂
Bozo in the maroon is annoying as hell
"Deep self reflection" means many people have told you, you suck.
Eisen talking about the vets on the steelers should handle this kid is ridiculous. Handle your own damn self and grow up young man. But he shows no signs of it and hes paying for it.
Maybe it’s because he’s not that good
Sanders has lost his trust for NFL teams that considered drafting him. Clearly not every team in the NFL needs a quarterback. Most teams have their guys . Shedeur has a bad attitude. And America stop the BS that its a race issue . Which its not
Maybe Sheduer just isn’t that good. The entire league is rarely wrong. Yes they do miss but it is rare.
They said he has been the worse interview in the combine ever. This is humblinmg experience for Sanders. Saying you just not that good and your attitude sucks
DJ, wants him to beg.  That's not happening.
A college player who won multiple awards including offensive player of the year but you want him to act different and beg you to take a chance and for what??
His daddy has to learn to shut his mouth. His dad screwed his son’s draft pick chances because he should’ve been picked 1st round over Dart.
If every team passes the problem is with the player not all the teams lol
This is a serious message sending to the Sanders family.
If you put a clown in a castle it doesn't make him a king, it makes the kingdom a circus
This is the nfl. They are 100% behind all of this.
It is personal 😢
These dudes are gonna be super embarrassed when it comes out he doesn’t watch film, can’t remember long play calls, and has a below average reading level. Couple that with a massive ego and an over involved father with an even bigger ego. He’s poison.   His daddy dumbed down the offense for him in college. NFL doesn’t work like that. Soon as you sit him down make him watch film and ask questions his lack of football knowledge shines bright.
The haters came out full force for this one😂
If I’m Shadeur why would I even want to be a part of the NFL at this point seeing how they’re doing me……don’t really need the money
I absolutely love it! Eat some humble pie nepo baby!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
5:30 this clown is literally telling sanders to beg you cant make this up
I absolutely love it! Eat some humble pie nepo baby!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I absolutely love it! Eat some humble pie nepo baby!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
From an eye talent Sheduer should have been gone but it works both ways the owners got to learn their is no NFL without the players and fans that supports them
He's undrafted because it's racial.....self reflection bs. Dude please
The NFL is cut throat.  Owners would stomp on each other’s throats to win.   There is no collusion. The 1st pick was a black Qb.   If teams thought Shedeur and everything he brings could help them win games more than guys available on the board they’d draft him..  Thats it.  End of story.  Every other narrative is fantasy.  Rich is an idiotic clown.
Basically Beg for something you deserve. This is America 🎶
When his dad made him a list of teams not to play for and for him to not combine and then not officially pro day  certain  gms and teams were probably  straight  up out on him. Personally  I wouldn't have used a first or second on sanders. Now, a third or 4th here, sure! But personality  matters and a lesson has been taught.
It appears to me that the NFL scouts, whether right or wrong, have determined Sanders is backup QB talent at best. Teams do not want a Backup QB and his family constantly criticizing their starter, OC, and HC. Then if the starter gets hurt and he underperforms in a game, they don't want that group criticizing their entire OL, WRs etc.  so the excuse becomes the team's lack of offensive talent.
If it was talent over everything, Kapernick would be playing in the NFL
Thank you rich.
I've never been more embarrassed  for someone more than Rich Eisen in this video.
This is about how the league feels about Dion, his son just gives them the same vibes. He is a mid  first, second round pick. It’s personal due to his dad and sons in the media prior.
So he asking him to beg hell no
6:16 hell no! He ain’t getting on his knees for these people. That’s poor advice.
Rich playing dumb to simp for sanders again
It really is simple. Shedeur Sanders just needs to grow up. Confidence has become entitlement. Hope he is capable of the deep reflection and change needed to truly be great.
I wouldn’t touch the guy with a ten foot pole if I were an NFL GM either. Let’s face it, they’re doing what’s best for their team. Just because you think this kind of guy could be handled in the locker room, doesn’t mean it’s going to work out.
They want him to say  yes daddy!! And regardless of the quarterback position Everyone knows a quarterback doesn't matter if he doesn't have a good line
Blacks have been humble for a long time YT people funny baker mayfield
deep self-reflection for Shadeur is staring at himself in the mirror for 25 minutes
If he was good enough, he would have been taken. He’s not worth the drama.
It’s a combination of: 1. Shedeur didn’t put max effort into the interview process, maybe only trying his best for certain teams. 2. Those certain teams were turned off by his personality or had higher grades on other qbs. 3. The whole Sanders production is not something the other teams who are only looking for a backup are interested in.
Maybe retiring his number in Colorado before the stands were empty after his final home game crystalized for NFL teams that the way they have gone about this is a bit forced.  Love Deion, in my opinion best DB ever to play and in the conversation for most exciting player to ever play but I can't help but feel how they went about this whole thing was a bit forced and arrogant and maybe these Billion dollar organizations just didn't want to deal with the circus that has surrounded him.  He was not a first round talent, especially given only a few team this year were looking for starting QBs in the draft.  He was a 3rd round talent and should have been drafted yesterday.
Using deion as an excuse is plain stupid, shedur comes off like an entitled brat who isn't a team player. It's a character issue not a skill issue
“We” all know what this is…they do too, no matter how they try to mask it
face it, he's tim tebow 2.0 questionable talent, with a circus that follows him around.  if you dont want the circus dont employ the clowns. only difference is teams seemed to have learned the lesson from the tebow bullshit. Dude couldnt hack it at the next level.
Why people act like shedeur sanders has a god given right to get drafted?
Gabriel is twice the quarterback that Sanders is. Sanders has the talent, but maturity and handling the spotlight properly (Johnny Manziel) is mandatory now and no one wants a QB with no self-awareness in 2025.
Not about skin color he's not that great and has bad attitude
They talk about him like he’s a bad guy. He’s confident. That’s what people don’t like.
He should beg? Wtf. He's proven already
This is ibvious collusion. Im tired of these billionair owbers trying to be the authority to the world.
CFL Is looking good at this point 🤔
How many QB's are taken in the first round with character issue red flags? The last one I can think of is Jamarcus Russell. I think the league learned their lesson. QB is the most important position on the field. They are the face of the franchise.  This isn't about the league teaching the Sanders a lesson. I would imagine league owners couldn't give a crap about Deion Sanders. It's not like his kids have built a pedigree like the Mannings.
Maybe Sanders should write another mumble rap no one will ever hear.
Baker Mayfield was on camera drunk running away from police but Sanders has issues????
hes going undrafted
He keeps saying humbled but these people gloating about a kid getting picked is sick mentally
Raiders getting him day 3- Brady wants him to come with a huge chip like he did so he stays Hungry all his career
This is business Not a charity
Shedeur turned a program around with his play on the field as a good passer of the football.  Shadeur has no scandals and has aquitted himself well at press conferences and in interviews.  Never has a quarterback who was a consensus 1st round pick dropped like this.  This is colusion at an unprecedneted level.  I have yet to hear one reasonable excuse for it from the media. Joe is right.  It's not T.O.E talent over everything.  It's talent over most things. One of those things is people's egos.  He better not beg anybody.  It would be better for him to come in as a free agent anyway.
y does he have to call the teams and beg for a spot when he better than people who got picked before him
Rich is keeping 💯.
The dude on the far right said, shadeur needs to beg the league...what a joke..collusion!!
Shaduer is not good that's why he hasn't been picked 😭 y'all think you know more then NFL teams?
Shadeur was in those meetings being cocky as can be😂 there no other reason why he would fall this far
Corporate logic is hilarious. It has been proven time and time again that hownyou interview has little to no true bearing on your performance ability and your value to a company/organization. Basically, most companies choose candidates the way most vvomen choose men...Based on criteria that looks amd sounds good but rarely produces tangible results. And both cant take accountability that they suck at evaluating prospects.
I watch Sheduer on tv as a young child till now     He is a humble child  His confidence didn’t match theirs He know a little bit more than those GM and it pissed them off ❤❤❤❤❤
As a colts fan… I’d take him for the lols. Pretty sure he could beat out AR and DJ.
Wouldnt even let rich speak smh
Thanks Rich Eisen for defending Shedeur immediately after Klatt tried to put this on him
I know this sucks for him but this is amazing for the NFL
The formula is simple,  teams don't think the juice is worth the squeeze.
Eisen, always trying to 'shape the narrative' instead of listening to the experts. He ain't it.
Shadeur is trying to be like his pops and that’s understandable but his pops is one of one and nowadays being that cocky and flashy is not tolerated bc we can’t have it get out of hand. It reminds me of like the slave days. Shadeur is free and that’s dangerous
I fell asleep 😴😴😴waiting on Sanders
All this pearl clutching over a subpar QB who just happens to be the son of an all time great player is typical performative theater. There is no “obligation” for an NFL team to draft any player just because the media thinks they should. Hundreds of people, scouts, GM’s, coaches and owners all said “nah” but a few pundits say yes so they must be right???🤷🏽😂😂
I believe they got together and said if you  hire him you fired as a coach ❤❤❤❤
I don't much about this kid, but he seems to have a reputation of being arrogant (like his father is). If he is such an arrogant annoying person having accomplished nothing so far,  imagine how big his head will get if he was the QB and he was winning games for a losing team.
Its crazy because his dad is football royalty they want him to shut up and dribble
I hope Rich keeps this energy for all the other players that drop. Sanders isn’t that good and apparently showed how arrogant he is in the interviews.  Crazy how people think a barely over .500 in the Big 12 QB was a star and top 20 player. He doesn’t elevate. He was elevated by Hunter
I blame Bronny James and Shannon Sharp, that whole little clock is toxic.  I don’t even watch NFL anymore haven’t seen a game in 4 years boring. Say what you want about Tebow & Kap they put buts in seats because they were entertaining.
I was watching this live and my youngest son got up and said " These guys are bickering about Sanders like the ladies on the View " and left the room !😂😂😂
Once Travis Hunter was off the board, Sanders talent left the building.
So if you’re not in the rooms, how can you tell him he needs to do deep self reflection and humble himself? Effing clowns
So he should beg behind closed doors ... Nah
I seriously cant wait until this kid shuts everyone up. I could care less about his flashy image. HES PRIMES SON. PRIME IS THAT GUY TOO...DIDNT HURT HUM
None of the other QBs in this draft, come pre-packaged with the 800 pound Deion tax.  Who wants that circus on your squad..?
Dad is the Red Flag.
SHOUTOUT RICH EISEN FOR SPEAKING THE TRUTH - these other guys are in DENIAL 💯💯
Quiet and humble Wow
Shadeur has has done nothing wrong on or off the field.
NFL - full of hypocrites on phony characters.
The nfl got a grudge with deion and his kids 😂
Ward, Dart, Rd1,  Shough Rd.2,  Milroe, Gabriel,  Rd 3.  Still no Sanders, and they still got.  Quinn Ewers, Texas. Kyle McCord, Syracuse. Will Howard, Ohio State. Hey Shedeur. You may end up throwing a "Free Agent" party. I wonder who will show up?
Rich is a real one!
God rich was so salty with Joel klatt. Good for Joel
The problem is Sanders isn’t that good. Period. I’ve watched him play a lot. There’s nothing about his game that’s special. He’s got an average arm. Very average athlete. A best a little bit above average decision making, but I’d question that based on the number of sacks he took.  The guy is a headache. His dad is a headache. And he’s just not that good. Period. Nobody wants a guy with a big mouth and a big spotlight who isn’t that talented.
So, this announcer wants Shedeur to grovel.
Too much parent involvement from league Superstar parents. No one has time to baby their kids.
Self reflection? You're just making accusations with no proof. Was this guy in the room. And that alone makes you drop 3 whole rounds?? Come on dude.
Why should have to beg y'all crazy
“Worst formal interview I’ve ever been in in my life. So entitled. The biggest thing is, he’s not that good.” - Unnamed NFL assistant coach on Shedeur Sanders.  And that’s why he hasn’t been drafted. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Like father, like son.
This is the biggest amount of Bullshit I ever heard, Sanders is the second best QB in the draft, and to go undrafted is insane.  He is a great kid, has never been in trouble, and believes in his talent. This is a way to try and humble Deon, but Deon is a winner and is going to keep winning! Deon is one of God's anointed people in this world, and it is nothing you can do about it! When Payton Manning father said that Eli was the best QB ever while he was in Highschool nobody said a word other than he is a really good father that believes in his Son!. The only difference is race, I'm sorry but this is racial garbage once again the double standard!
He will do great in the ufl next year just watch!😅
The teams don’t care about any of this. This is just media hype. Maybe Shedeur is just not that good.
Use this moment, Mr Sanders, get on that field and make these owners PAY!!!   Its BS and everybody knows it, and you need to make the world understand the man you are!  GODSPEED!!!
This does feel incredibly personal.
Too much baggage, Daddy issues, arrogance, already thinks he's a star already and hasn't even seen an NFL football field and the Manning syndrome. He'll end up being like Ryan Leaf, take the money no production and leave the NFL in disgrace.
Beg he sound stupid this why people not watch these Hollywood sport shows.
I think it's hilarious.  What team wants the Prime time family circus hovering around the team. All his "swagger" and his little S squared dollar sign logo?.... it screams red flags.
The problem for Sanders is whichever team drafts him will have his Dance Dad to deal with as well.
Honestly I’m not impressed with any of these QB picks, Will Howard and Cam Ward are the best in my opinion, but damn this QB class is a lot of what ifs, there’s no sure fire QBs that you know will light it up day 1
Rich there was literally a QB controversy in Pittsburgh going into the Ravens playoff game on whether they should Play field over Wilson . What do you mean it wouldn’t happen it Pittsburgh
Juicy.
i just can't...he did it at 2 bad schools with a terrible OL and he seems to be a great kid.  this is a quarterback's league.  there are SEVERAL teams that NEED a qb.  if you don't have one you're dead in the water.  yesterday was a GREAT chance for someone to steal themselves a good qb for peanuts.  honestly hope a really good team with a starting qb takes him just to spite the other 31 teams.
I hope Sanders creates a story like Brady.
3 of you are full of bull sht.  Any idiot knows Shedeur is not going to bring cameras into the locker room or anywhere else near an NFL team.  This is a lame excuse to cover the fact that most of the NFL is hating Deion, pure and simple.  Jealous of his success and cowardly taking it out on his son.  And if you don't believe me I have 2 words for you - Sean Keeler.
Rich  Eisen is the only one that is being truthful. The other guys are kissing butt
It's not just the kid. That can be handled. It's his dad constantly critiquing any team he plays for. What team wants to hear " in my day"  or  "my kid can  do it better" after every game.
Forget the Epstein files. I wanna see the Shedeur interview tapes!
Okay Rich and your biased analysis. I can’t take Rich seriously anymore
Having your College Jersey Retired when you had a 13-12 record as a starter is nasty work. Yet having the attitude like you won 2 National Titles is beyond arrogant  For context: CU won a National Title in 1990 and none of the players on that team had their number retired
All through this young man's career he's been told how poised he is, how adult he is, how he has all of the right tools... Bull-ish. Eisen is correct, it's personal. This young man grew up on the professional field watching his dad.  He's been schooled on what to expect, and you want him to beg? They are trying to change the narrative and ruin Deion Sanders legacy and college  program in the process.  I personally would shop my talents in Canada and become Legendary over there. Warren Moon did it and still  got a gold jacket and a bust in Canton.
Now they want Shedeur to beg! Don't do it man! This is clearly aimed at teaching the Sanders a lesson, which rich white men feel they have to do to outspoken and confident black men. This is the devilishness of America
You asking shedeur Sanders to beg😂 who do you think is some peasant😂 don't be a jackass bro
I firmly believe there’s a difference between being cocky vs confident, I love seeing personality so I’m a huge Sanders fan. I believe regardless of talent he does know football, he will care about the program. That being said, the NFL is totally sending them a message. He will get drafted. He will head into this season with a HUGE chip on his shoulder. If they entice him to perform well, the NFL wins. If they cause him to cave in and fall, the NFL wins.
My god Rich can be such a cuck at times.  Yet again, he’s taking a stance that no one else agrees with.
Fear of offending Deion is omnipresent with NFL and ESPN reporters. Shadeur throws an accurate and very slow pass. He runs slow; he takes a lot of sacks.
Retiring his sons number was the dumbest  thing to do!  1-8 against top 25 teams  Was embarrassed  in the ONLY BOWL game he played..  No legend   Not worthy  of retiring a number.  Lets get real ...
Yall want to see a confident black man beg a yt man for what is rightfully supposed to be his. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!! Sheduer is rich and successful, he don't have to beg. His play is good enough to play in the NFL. So dont call them and NEVER beg them!! Sheduer will have the last laugh!
Teams simply don't want the attitude and the baggage that comes with him. He did skip the combine (as have many other players) where rumored questions about his arm strength may have come to light.
“What exactly is it”?? ITS HIS ATTITUDE!!
How is he bringing in his own crew, his crew was family at Colorado where his dad coached. He won't ruffle any feathers in someone else's house. Like wtf. The kid was raised right.
What Shedeur should be doing instead of begging for a job is talk to every one of these 32 teams and asking them why they didn’t choose him. Let THEM tell him the hard truth. All these so called experts have no idea. Then just maybe if he’s serious about his career he will set aside his pride and arrogance and do what needs to be done. He has the makings but not the maturity yet.
Keeping disruptive influence out of the locker room is managing your team how you want
He struggles at playing his own position. Been to two different schools and just doesn’t look comfortable or relaxed in the pocket.  Takes days to release the ball, isn’t mobile, hasn’t been under anyone else other than his father, and his pops is picking and choosing where he goes. He doesn’t need the League, as much as everyone else does. The UFL needs help, go there and change it. Or become a camera man like yo brother.
Shedeur is being humbled by God . Testing him if he would stil follow Jesus even if his dreams did not come true .
So he want Sheseur Sanders to sing and dance. Gtfoh
It’s like Tim Tebow
Pretty disingenuous of Rich TBH. Dictating teams - will/won't play. Sandbagging interviews. Unprofessional before being professional. Humble pie will do everyone some good.
The NFL made a mistake the tried to humble shedeur but made him the most talked about player in the draft
But My Daddy is......
It's not his play on the field so now we judge him on his attitude. No trouble off the field just confidence. Smh that's crazy. Thanks Rich for standing up for what's right
I can't blame Rich. He is incapable of understanding this, and that's ok
Why would sanders beg in the 4th round? What a clown to say something like that.   The money means nothing at this point and there is zero chance he wont be taken
They on BS!!!!! Most of them grey boys can never admit to racism. They’ll try and see it any other way. Rich Eisen is not in that mix. He know what is up and that’s why he pushed back. Ain’t no dude with the resume Shedeur has goes this late or undrafted.
Its simple...the talent isnt enough to justify to PERCEIVED baggage Sanders comes with. And you know what...its their (the GMs and coaches) prerogative. He needs to go to whichever team ends up drafting him, bide his time for a year or two and take his chance when it eventually comes
Why would he beg a team to play when he just told you GOD got him.
This Draft is already LEGENDARY 😂
There’s always the Arena league. Legendary.
NFL really sis the greatest product in this country you aren’t getting stories like this from any other show, business, etc😂. The son of one of the greatest players ever sliding in the draft because of things that’s not football related
It's to many narratives being spent without calling out the BS. Right is right an wrong is wrong. An this is wrong on so many levels
Like Tim Tebow, Shadeur Sanders is not as good as the CFB hype said he was, and not as bad as the NFL GM's thought.
An he is definitely not better then J.milroe hands down an GOD just humbled everyone I mean everyone yea league sent a message to yall too the ones on t.v. all yall have talked about is S.Sanders what about all these other guys who made it through the real struggle give them congratulations
No teams want hard knocks either. As media people, this panel seems to have a blindside
If he is undraftrd b/c of "attitude" I call BS b/c these clowns will draft criminals and horrible humans all the time so gtfoh
Not only that who the hell wants their father at the training camp where your son is supposed to be practicing at who the hell was deion Sanders around them and tell them the coaches and them what to do with their son everybody knows how old is deion Sanders is he's an arrogant person
The sanders BROUGHT THIS ON THEMSELVES . Stop looking for conspiracies  or race bait.   Shakur  is no legend   And no nfl team wants deions DRAMA .  CALL IT  as it is..
Collusion!!!
He’s the aka Morant of football but less talented than Ja. Who wants that?
No coach wants Deion waiting in the wings when they lose  or his entitled son starts whining. No starting QB wants that situation either. We lose, Deion comes in and starts his overrated son and I lose my job. I wouldn't want that situation.
It's the body language and social media. I'm guessing 🤷🏾‍♂️ 😊
Rich... sheduer sanders is a big red flag. He is manziel , ryan Leaf, and Jamarcus Russell all in one. That's who sanders is comparable too.
Shedur’s fall is legendary.  Eisen is a Sanders’ apologist and Klatt is spot on.
This owners are very disgusting is personal hate on another black man because y'all need control wow  sad this is the country we live in
He's all name no talent
Possible dirty drug test🤷‍♂️
Is fine bro dont need the money hes gonna be on vengeance tour
Guess what, humility. First Nico now Sanders, the pendulum is swinging back. Eisen doing his best Nancy Kerrigan “but whyeeeee”
This is a disgrace to the league. TOE. talent over everything.
This is the PERFECT message for Sanders.  Shedeur did not play against elite talent.  Milroe, and Dart SHOULD be picked before sanders.  They are FAR better QBs that played against better talent.   They thought the same thing about Jalen Hurts and THEY were proved wrong.
He’s 13-12 overall at CU, 1-6 against top 25 teams…. Enough said
Rich Eisen the real one. Protect this man. The other panels are asking surface questions and Rich hitting the deep rooted question. ✊🏽✊🏽
Damn rich sounds like hes dating sanders lol
If you have a monster first 2 years then struggle, everyone will call you a bust…but if you grind over your career and get the wins and that SB, then thats all that matters. How many NFL legends and playmakers weren’t drafted in the 1st round?
What coach wants to deal with this kid and his father
If I’m Shedeur I’m not begging any of these Punk Mutha GMs to make there teams a winner these petty immature GMs are shady Shedeur can and wants to play he doesn’t have to god will send him another opportunity that’s better than the Not For Long players are property league Cam ward was drafted one too spite Shedeur because of his daddy
W0W!
Yeah, a lot of people can play football better and aren't as much of a pain to deal with.  You got to look at it this way, 32 teams passed on him 3 times, and it's clear this guy annoyed everyone.
"This is a time for deep self-reflection for Shadeur". - Well said.
Shedur Sanders arrogance, ego, and personality outweigh his talent and play by leaps and bounds. I think he is a good player but his name and all that ego are a turn off and his talent isn’t good enough to ignore that.
All we can do is speculate on why he fell. He WILL be drafted. He has enough talent. What I dont like is the overwhelming coverage on him before and NOW because he hasnt been picked yet.
He’s not that good. He’s an entitled cocky brat… don’t make it about color because a lot of color got drafted before he did
Bottom line shedeur is an above average college Qb.  Through social media they tried to create a superstar image that nobody in the league is buying.  Because of social media it created an entitled brat that is more concerned about Snapchat  and twitter than football.
I liken the Sanders situation kind of like the Lavar Ball situation. Dad thinks son/sons is the best thing the game has ever seen but the rest of the league does not see it like this.   Deion has a huge ego, but he is in no way as bad as Lavar Ball. I am just saying the circus surrounding Shedeur is more than most teams want to deal with. Especially since he is not a "once in a lifetime" talent...
QB draft is like a lottery.  The harsh reality is most don't pan out in the NFL.  We have seen spectacular failures over the years, more than successes.  According to the pros in the know, this QB draft class is underwhelming, which explains why all QB drafted so far are backups or WIP, except Cam Ward who will start.  It seems teams are not willing to take the bet on a QB that has played very well in a mediocre Big 12 conference, which may not necessarily translate well vs NFL defences.  It's not like Shedeur had to play vs defences like Penn State while in college.  So high stats vs weak teams isn't really the end all be all. But one thing is sure,  it's the circus Shedeur brings to a team.   Clearly most teams don't want to deal with the drama from a backup/development QB.  Just imagine having to deal with the constant tweets, press conferences, Deion's input, etc.... for a backup.  Being a coach in the NFL is hard enough and dealing with a diva has to be pretty low on the agenda.  PS - we will see if Cam Ward lives up to expectations, but at least he got a better rating from the NFL teams and played in a tougher college conference than Shedeur. my 2 cents
His style of play doesn’t translate well to the NFL in a way that is worth taking the risk, IMO.
It's the Cam Newton effect. At the end of Cams career, that teams didn't want to bring him in as a backup because of the noise that comes with him. Sanders camp is so entrenched in the media that the circus is inevitable. How upset Rich is about him falling just proves it.
The entitlement factor is big here. If he were not the son of the great DS, he would just be another QB trying to get drafted.
Shedeur need to take his name out the draft
FIIIIIIRE BALLARD!!!!!!!! FIIIIIIRE BALLARD!!!!!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I bet he's drafted #1 in the arena football league! He may have to show something if he wants to be a real pro football player. I bet he doesn't get drafted in the NFL! Sometimes your not necessary
Joel Klatt and howie just lost me as a fan. Bro wtf are they even talking about
Respect for Rich Eisen lost, respect for Joel Klatt continues to rise.  Rich is friends with Deion, and said friendship is desteoying logic and reason in his mind.
The SANDERS CLAN ARE WEAK ..FRAUDARADO BUFFALOES... THE CLOWNSHOW IS OVER... PORTAL POUND PUPPIES ANR RUNNING BACK TO POUND😅😅😅😅😅
Colts draft a loser at 5, now competing against another BUST.... but yet...we ignore Sanders
I can see to a degree from Deion saying he wants to look after his kid cause he experienced the NFL and how cut throat it can be. Then again at the same time he needs to let his kid live his life and hoped he taught him how to be an independent adult
What Rich Eisen doesn't get is this.....This isn't a "clown show look at ME" opportunity.....you're applying for the TOP job, face of the organization which happens to be a BILLION dollar Company that's part of a MULTI-Billion dollar International League.....having some humility and respect for those who are part of it is a MUST.  That Colorado Buffalo "SWAG" is NOT going to fly.....and having Dione with a camera and microphone in his face everyday isn't going to be accepted.....The Sanders family made a massive mistake on how they approached this and its negatively impacting Shedeur Sanders.....the whole thing stinks but if I am an NFL owner I wouldn't touch the Sanders Gang with a 250 foot pole.
They want him to beg to be in the League.... 🤔
It's because his attitude plus Deions comments also y retire his jersey I understand Travis H. But his makes me think he did it all alone what about all the other guys an it was too quick an no pro day the show case just wondering
Damn he just told him to beg lol , thats crazy
26 teams are completely set at QB,  and they have more pressing needs than drafting a backup QB.  Add that to the teams Sanders said he doesn't want to play for and this is what you get
Great Coverage 👍😄 Honestly the only college Quarterback I heard before the draft was Sanders LoL 😆 It's a real head scratcher for sure 😁👍❣️
Sometimes it’s Gods work, perhaps he needed to be humbled a bit.
Who wants to pay money for the circus?  Pick him up in the 5th or 6th round and if he gets cut, it ain’t gonna costs teams anything, the fact that his dad just retired his jersey at CU should tell you everything you would want to know that you’re getting with him
He’s getting the Gelo ball treatment and he hasn’t even stole anything 📠🤣😭😂🫡
There's one HUGE FLAW no one is talking about. Sanders has never played for any other coach other than his dad IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE from pop Warner all the way till now. Thats not normal. That lack of experience with other coaches running the show is huge. Sports in muscle memory and mental adaptation and when you have had only one philosophy your entire life it becomes extremely hard to undue the bad habits that can come with only doing things one way
Sander should go back to school and put up some numbers so when his number is retired then it will seem alright.
I don’t know if it’s collusion, but I’m sure they're thinking of a Johnny Manziel and even a Tim Tebow who have sort of larger than life media personas and just don’t want to deal with that. Your talent has to be off the charts to make it worth it and Sanders’ isn’t.
There's a reason only 5 to 7 organizations have a chance to win every year. Wake up people.
I think the world is starting to see very clearly how pessimistic and how cynical and how negative the old timers currently running the NFL are. The type of people who fight change simply because they want things to stay how they were back in the good old days. Luckily most of those people will retire or will no longer be here with us within the next 25 years because of how old they are. And people like me are still young enough that we will be here to see when the NFL finally evolves into a newer mindset. When that happens that will be a good day.
Do you guys believe in conspiracies now ?!
Rich Eisen is the worst sort of limousine liberal
Talking heads: "we really can't wrap our heads around why people would root against Shidder. He's only the jerk son of an egomanic who paid people to talk him up and raise his draft stock. Its baffling why people want to watch the entitled son of a multimillionaire fail. We just can't understand why people are acting like this! "  Really? You can't fathom why we're all happy to see him fall? Really??
Travis Hunter got Picked at #2. Stop the bs of "the Deion hate is real".
For a change a little intensity, and no NFL WE LOVE YOU, GOOD job Rich. Arch Manning was an angel when he played the Chargers.  But he is good old Arch. I'm white by the way
All the billionaires and owners and GMs.... BLACK FLAG ALERT!!!!   They are doing it because Deon said stuff about teams and Billionaires got together and sent a message.  This is BEYOND BS
And another thing this kid Shedur didn't have an offensive line and he still had crazy stats. Imagine if he had an offensive line how crazy his stats would've been.
Don't pick up phone and call nobody
Thank you, Rich E!!!
Rich is absolutely clueless here.
Rich wasn't having it. Was speaking so much truth in everything he said.
I question if he is dealing with being a legacy? Is it the same as how Bronny is being treated?  Is it his abilities, or is it because his self identity is overshadowed by his family's connection ... specifically his father's star?
the narrative that racism somehow is to blame for this is laughable. nfl teams would draft a golden retriever if they thought it'd help them win games. but it is absolutely "personal", and the explanation is easy: the player is overrated, and the combination of the player plus the player's dad would result in a three-ring circus around any team insane enough to pick him early.
Rich has always been a real one.
Lol 😂😂😂
Shedeur was never a 1st round talent, but the "analysts" wanted to talk and act like he was
Rich just can't stop with the Deion love.  He can't admit that  the sense of entitlement isn't just Sheduer, it's also Deion. It's amazing how he can't admit it.  Rich brings up the Steelers, they passed. The Raiders passed. Get over it Rich.  As for DJ's suggestion.  Does he really think Sheduer AND Deion...especially Deion, will uphold that promise? Good Lord..Rich can't grasp the reality of the whole Sanders situation.
Nah, they don't wanna the circus around him. And the moment he fails, everyone is going to chant " hiring Deon Sanders". It's just the coach and manager gate keeping man. 😂
What is that dude in the red jacket saying 🤦‍♂️
All your theories are meaningless. Every team wants to win. They aren't sending messages. There are no conspiracies. He's not that good. Hunter carried him. That's it.
There are too many examples of QBs who were not drafted on Day 1 or 2 or at all who went on to be successful and/or become a hall of famer.  Just chill and make the most of the opportunity when it comes.
RICH IS RIGHT! They took MANY GUYS WITH RED FLAGS 🚩 WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING IS DIFFERENT! THIS IS PERSONAL!
Rich Eisen sticking up for Shadeur is embarrassing
Joel Klatt I applaud you for saying what you said about Sanders. Everything. He was not the best QB prospect based on skill. There are not enough QB needy teams either to take somebody who has promise in his game but also has an ego like the empire state building.
It may be part bringing a camera crew everywhere he went during college and several teams saying he seemed disinterested during interviews. I don't think this is message sending I think it's teams being cautious bringing in someone that could potentially end up the face of the team.
sorry rich, just because he is your buddy, dont be upset!!
Not worth the drama
This is a strong statement by the NFL telling young nfl prospects that the league isn't interested in prima donnas who haven't proven themselves yet at the highest level. Sure, go win a super bowl, get a pro bowl selection and then you can strut your stuff but until theyve put in the work and shown success, acting like you're the center of the universe isn't tolerated. Im sure some of this behavior stems from Dad. Either way, stay humble.
They want him to KISS @$$.... NFL is bullshit
Welcome to Saskatchewan Shedeur! Go Riders!!
If teams wanted him, they would have grabbed him. Everyone calling the nfl racist is absolutely dumb. 90% of the nfl rosters are black men. So that garbage racism take goes out the window. Teams don’t want him. The only landing spot for him possibly is Pittsburgh. People need to quit racebaiting, it’s pathetic and disgusting.
Teams making it personal? Stop. This is what happens when the hype hits reality.
This is all performative bullcrap.  Shadeur is not talented enough for any team to want to deal with his Dad’s bulls**t.
Remember that position wasn’t designed for a confident,fearless black black and attempting to do it the way his father did….I don’t like to bring color into it but we have to be honest that position wasn’t acceptable for black people not because we couldn’t play it but because that is the face of a team
He’s been blackballed period, it’s a racket, all the players are slaves to the league, and to the media, let’s see who can tap dance and smile the biggest
No one wants Prime Time in their business!
It’s ok and necessary to be humbled throughout life. The family is a great family who are confident people. They don’t often bad mouth others, they just talk extremely highly of themselves. It is what it is. I think he uses this as fire and improves. This was embarrassing and surprising, but it will be OK
Wouldnt beg them for anything
He shouldn't have to apologize for who he is ! The NFL IS ABSOLUTELY SENDING THE SANDERS FAMILY A MESSAGE!
The only way for this kid to be successful, he needs to play his final year somewhere other than Colorado. He needs to prove he can succeed being coached by someone else. The only problem with this is next year's draft will be very QB strong.
" Every stripper is crazy except the one you're in love with."  Which basically means that every team knows that drafting this guy is a train wreck in waiting.  No accountability, famous father who has an inflated (to say the least) sense of his kid's ability.  Shaedur will be a coach killing circus side show with Ok talent and phenomenal drama potential.  Who wouldn't want the bi-polar stripper to move in with them after a week?  Glad teams saw through it.
Wow
You are a QB where teams have questions about your arm strength.  Your response is to skip the combine & team workouts?!??? 😮 That's a red flag about attitude.  Doing the combine is for mere mortals, not a sure fire HOF'er like me. Anyone who drafts me will be SO LUCKY & should bow down to My Greatness without any need for workouts!  🤔 And about the arm strength question, is the QB skipping the combine to HIDE something bad?????
If you didn’t see this coming you just weren’t paying attention. He is a decent QB. He has never  played for anyone but his father. Deon coached him all the way back to PeeWee football. He has never played top level competition. ESPN spent months building him up to be something he is not. I’m sure ESPN knew teams weren’t that interested. They just created a story so they could cover it.
I absolutely can not believe this kid is still on the draft board going into the 4th round.     I hope the Steelers pick this kid up today.    This is absolute awesome value in the 4th round...
I just lost all respect for Joel Klatt.. he literally covered Sheduer closer than most and this is the take he gives?
SHEDEUR SUCKS...KIPER IS A FRAUD
They are ginna ha e to SHOW SHEADEURS interview to the world at this point! Because this is ridiculous!!!
It sounds like Joel knows that teams don’t want to deal with shedeur’s arrogance. The Sanders’ can’t handle criticism because it’s written off as “negativity” or “haters.” They don’t deal with the substance of the criticism. Hard not think there was not a collective decision by the teams; but hard to disagree with it. Shedeur said earlier this month that he doesn’t care about what other people think. I guess it does matter.
Beg??? Why does he have to beg?? Please
Deion is Shedeur's daddy.  There's no other coach that is going to be able to coach him the same.  Deion ruined him.
I am very thankful for the integrity and humanity that Rich Eisen brings to sports discourse.  Simply one of the best out there.
HUMBLE????? In other words beg for the job. Are you kidding me? The league to Sheduer ...... we will put you in your place.
Shedeur just isn't (probably) a starting quarterback. He is a mid-range talent who (probably) should've had a 3-5 round projection. I can see teams deciding they'd rather take a flier on Milroe who at least has some elite tools and sufficient reps. This sucks for him, but I think the first round projection was more surprising than this slide.
What a disingenuous and insultinf title. He isn't "undrafted". He has 3 rounds left. Why are you acting like the draft us over? Plenty of fantastic players go in the later rounds
How much did they get paid to keep mentioning him all day.
This is another “shut up and dribble moment”.. elway/manning pulled the same bs and chose who they played for
At this point, Sanders is going to be a steal.
The juice simply isnt worth the squeeze..
Shedeur was simply too much of a distraction and his entitlement attitude was too much for general managers to deal with. Retiring his number without achieving anything? Why? Because of this, he may not be drafted as teams won't want the media circus that follows.
This is getting annoying
4 comments, oh my! This is getting to me.... Didn't Warren Moon prove himself in the CFL and go on to the HOF?  Was that hard on his ego? Maybe. Did he decide to pay the price, take responsibility and be relentless?  Oh yes.  What about Doug Flutie?  His journey in pro football is legend. Is that so wrong? Should Doug Flutie have been drafted in first round and become starter for the NYJ and won 3 Super Bowls?  Sure, that would be a nice story.  I like the real story, better.  Doug Flutie is the coolest dude ever, and a fantastic/entertaining football player. (Drop kick, ftw!) If Shadeur S followed in their footsteps, he would be my hero.  I have a feeling he doesn't have the grit to match those two legends.
All seriousness, He Thanked GOD. When doors are closed others are open.
They basically saying code switch .. tap dance. Make yourself palatable. Dim your light.   FAWK THAT.
Still hoping raiders will pick up shedeur but it will be very interesting if jags use a late round to pick him up as a backup to tlaw…. God forbid tlaw gets hurt but then your backup has insane connection with your brand new Ferrari? Nuts.
The tap dancing about what's really going on here would make Sammy Davis Jr proud ....lol
The networks must be falling all over themselves trying to come to grips with the reality that is the Sanders family. They (Sanders family) played themselves too big and the networks couldn't help themselves. They politically corrected themselves right out of credibility with the months long narrative of Shedeur being picked top 5, top 3, first pick, first round while going around touting how he was going to change organizations. The short and nasty is Shedeur and daddy scared ALL the teams (apparently)!!
Dude should have been drafted, even with the last pick. I feel some team had dropped the ball.
Quinn Ewers is better than Sanders.
Eh, teams are saying that Deion had talent (a lot of it) but he was more trouble than he was worth, and his son is probably gonna be worse. Why bother? These teams are also waking up to the fact that this really is a team sport and you can win without “superstars” if the entire team has the right culture. People who aren’t good for their culture aren’t going to work for them until they grow up.
Umm nfl owners don't want bronny james Jr thing there , that's all , like college basketball there so many more talented players then him.but cause his dad get drafted is he a starter hmmm , show me his stats
jacksonville should of grabbed Sanders...paired him back up with Hunter.  What do you lose, you might as well gain some popularity and attention.  As for Lawrence...trade him, let them compete or have sanders sit a year
All Political !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The nfl has drafted literal phycopaths..  the kids never had an issue off the field and all they keep talking about is off the feild..he might as well go to the CFL cause if he is drafted they'll just cut him to embarrass him
Umm nfl owners don't want bronny james Jr thing there , that's all , like college basketball there so many more talented players then him.but cause his dad get drafted is he a starter hmmm , show me his stats
I wonder how much it is the case of not wanting to let him play for certain franchises and those franchises prefer to pick players that will actually show up. Maybe they take a change on him as an undrafted rookie to sign. Cheaper and more controle for the franchises.
I have a hard time feeling bad for someone who did more to hurt themselves than they did to help themselves.
Much respect to Rich for being willing to stand on an island and not roll with the BS. Shaduer is paying the price for being confident & cocky. He’s being talked about as if he’s committed a series of crimes.
They want sanders to beg??? They want him to not act like himself and play and carry himself with confidence?? They have never done this to other players even at the qb position. Rich is absolutely right there’s been guys that the league would probly not have wanted anywhere near their locker rooms but because they can play they get a pass? Baker mayfield was the number one pick after being one of the cockiest assholes in college football. While weeks before the draft he was arrested for running from police while drunk…. Let’s not forget him holding his junk in front of the opposing team. Like what are we talking about sending a message to sanders and wanting him to beg this is crazy bruh.
I think the draft should be a pay-per-view event so I don’t have to watch it
You're all aware that Shedeur sucks, right?
Play on the field? hahahahahah Maybe it's the off field play?
NFL racist!
Why he got to beg for it
Why didn't his personal coachTom take him?  Why didn't Tomlin take him? Doesn't that scream "backup"? Then why wouldn't they take him as a backup in a later round? Nobody wants a backup in the locker room with that level of narcissism and hype hanging over his head. And the really strange part is that it may not be the kid's narcissism that they fear.
He threw teammates under the bus 3 times this year after losses. Say what you will but I have never heard Lamar,  josh Allen, or Maholmes do that ever.
They saw the room Shedur had built for the draft and thought, "This kid thinks he's all that? Bet" 😂
Rich 3-0
They wanna see a Blackman beg! If he calls them teams and say that behind close doors. It’s going to come to light. Every news media would have that info and put it out there from their so called reliable source. To make that black family look weak! 🤦🏾‍♂️
This is very personal! He has so much motivation now to get in some where and ball out.
Lmao you have to have talent to say 'ToE'. Shadeur does not have the talent these buffoons keep telling you he has. Anyone who watched CFB with their eyeballs could see that it was all Hunter--and the Leavue did too. Quit making it out to be a personal matter.
Baker Mayfield was running from cops in college!!! Shut up Klatt! You're a clown!! Rich us a real one for speaking the truth!
Mike Green had 2 Sexual Assault cases, he gets drafted in the 2nd round by the Ravens, Sanders however, needs to be humbled. Now im not saying that Mike Green is guilty, I'm simply making the comparison as a way to show what the NFL gets truly offended over. If you're your own brand and you don't fall in line, we'll Kaepernick you, but if you have a case, no problem for as long as it can be taken care of.   This "he has to be humbled" is the same nonsense we seen with Baker Mayfield.
Brady was 199 picked! Everyone overlooked the goat.  Brady even trained Shedeur. Shedeur will be great!
The Browns gave 100 million to a rapist.   The NFL doesn't care about that but the press is too much.
I love the hypocrisy of these people.  They voted for paying kids millions coming straight outta high-school in NIL deals. But now they don't like that the same kids are cocky and extremely arrogant.  What did yall expect to happen? I said it over 10 years ago. If they start paying college players.  They'll destroy football.
Rich is right, if Mike Green gets drafted (by the team that employed Justin Tucker!) then it's not about character for anyone else. It's possible that they don't like his dad or whatever, but the most likely thing is that they just don't like his play enough.
Did he just say that he should call the owners and beg them 😮
If he had a year or two ledt, he should have gotten paid at CU. But I don’t believe his dad helped at all.
Shedeurs is a new age new era player. NFL teams are not ready for him. The old farts running these teams need to step down and let the next generation take over.
I'm sad for the NFL. This clearly doesn't look good. Shedeur Sanders is being blackballed. He should have been picked without a doubt by the 2nd Round.
People Stop It! Everyone saying he said this, he bring to many distractions. Run Boy Run, that's what you want. Speak when I tell you to and while you at it, I'm going to treat you like the property you are. We have seen this narrative for over a 100 years. 2025 and it's still happening. Ask yourself this, where would the sport be without black players? I say this because I want that same energy when Arch Manning gets drafted.
Who’s Shadeur’s agent?
The free advice at 5:30 mark sound like he working w the owners to prove that point!
"It's called Racism" Self appointed Rev. Al Sharpton Calm down, it's sarcasm!
People are way too emotional over this Shedeur stuff.  First of all, no one can dictate whom any team has to draft.  You’re not paying that contract.  Secondly, we’ve all known that more comes into play in drafting a player, than talent and potential; it has always been that way.  So, spare me all the drama about a guy who really was barely over average in College.  He is talented, but he’s not that talented.
Whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make promising.
Rich a Real One 💯
Lost some respect for Rich after he made all those excuses. The kid is a over cocky mid range qb and his attitude along with his meddling father are just not worth a high draft pick.   Too many people trying to make it about race while the humble well mannered qb of the same race went first over all.  Its not about skin its about personality
It's called being "uncoachable"  Can't believe these guys don't get it.
Absolutely hilarious
Attention is a double-edged sword. You're not just painting a bullseye on your head you're painting a bullseye on everyone around you. He hasn't proven anything and he's painted the biggest bullseye on him and wonders why teams passed? Narcissism is running rampant nowadays man
I love how DJ is all, "Go call the guys you met with and beg them to come draft you." Wow.
WE LOVE RICH!!
Basically saying stay in your place boy. This is why we need our own league.
How ironic - Shadeur's being described as an "untalented distraction", yet the NFL is racking in MILLIONS behind the "Shedeur Shakedown". Everyone's watching...everyone's talking...everyone's waiting to see "Will Shedeur be drafted?"
I knew it would only be a matter of time that the talking heads cried or implied racism. Their answer to everything.  Couldn't be the fact that he is so arrogant and cocky that most consider him un coachable and too cocky to take coaching along with all the baggage he brings.  I heard on the radio yesterday he stopped an interview with one team to reply to a text to someone on tic Tok. How damn disrespectful can you get if that is true. This whole thing is so damn hypocritical and pathetic.  I guess because he is deions boy and is an average QB he should automatically be picked immediately.
Eisen’s take was off. Clearly Sanders attitude has resulted in his draft stock plummeting. The NFL isn’t responsible to change behavior from day 1. FAFO!
Shedeur getting Kapernicked out the gate ✊🏾
Rich is so full of himself, he knows exactly why this is happening as do we all.
This was good based commentary.
Why is this a tragedy? Is not getting drafted in the first round the worst thing that can happen to an athlete?  Not really. Plenty of success stories start later. (TB12) Now, on the other hand if you live for social approval and you have only been handed opportunity after opportunity your whole life?  Yeah.  This could SEEM to be a problem. RE is missing the public's perception of this. 99,999% of the public is not a gifted QB destined to play pro ball. We have all had crap jobs and started somewhere besides the top. Should I feel bad that a prince in the castle didn't get a new pony for his birthday?
Mike Tomlin couldn't control AB, c'mon Rich you know this and you idiots need to let Joel klatt talk. 😊
He’s going to the Cowboys!!
I don't hear anyone mentioning coachability concerns, bro has literally only ever been coached by his dad
Why does he have to beg?!!
Eisen  knows the truth. You don’t just get one sanders youget two. Two headaches two attitudes two social media accounts etc. Talent doesn’t equal the headache that comes with it. Period, Point blank.
NFL is a joke   Dumpster Juice   THIS IS AMERIKKK
1:59 Sanders' play does not suggest that he should already have been selected...unless it was to be a backup/camp fodder. Quite the opposite. And its not just about his play. Its about his toxic self-important, poor sportsmanship ego maniac diva attitude and character that is poison to a cohesive, well-run team and turns off fans by the millions. Why does the sports media so steadfastly refuse to see what fans and league experts have known for quite awhile???
These guys are proving the teams point. Look at the distraction and media attention just in the draft over Sheduer, teams don’t want that all year over a backup mid level QB
Rich is pissed!
It was always about the hype not talent & who wants to bring in a headache 😂
He’ll be hating on any team that may draft him
Hard to believe Eisen has been around this long and still has no clue how hard it is to manage a 53 man locker room. Players have friends and family filling their head with trash that they bring into locker convos. You can’t just trust 1 or 2 of your vets will control the locker room. It’s a constant battle controlling the narrative and guys like Tomlin can’t just give some cool speech and expect everyone to fall in line. It’s an everyday battle for coaching staff
sander should go to the cfl and come back as a kurt warner hof
Platt, who I like and watch his college football podcast, was adamant to the end (eve of draft) that Sanders “should” be first we off board. He let his emotional side (Alma mater, love for Shedeur all season) dictate his reasonable side (Ward clearly the most pro-ready and overall talented qb according to 99% of scouts/insiders) on this issue…his continued stubbornness surprised me. He was not alone, of course. Other prominent football people insisted “ Sanders could go top 3” right up until draft started. Also think that Deion’s shadow over a coach that has his son and the poor interviews has played into this free fall more than anticipated. Ryan Clark, who has turned into a clown before our eyes, claimed racism as the primary mover behind the unexpected fall on draft boards…lol Silliness abounds. Sanders probably ends up an NFL backup for bulk of career.
He’s an average talent at best, I don’t get why obviously every NFL team can see that plain as day but these pundits can’t
Tom Brady went in the 6th round!!! Nuff Said🤷‍♂️
Is he a good football player? Yes. Is he a great one? He probably could be if he lets go of his ego. He didn't do anything special in college football. Oh he should be picked first round because he's a Sanders? No. The kid blamed his own teammates for losing. Who would want a player like that? Who wants a player with an ego like that? Where is Cam Newton? Exactly. Where is Colin Kaepernick? Exactly. Where are all the other players like that? Exactly. No team wants that attention. Especially a QB.
Maybe its because they have their own brand and they dont eant their brand to get big
His name isn't toby
He deserves to have sign as a free agent and work for something. Such an entitled little boy. I hope Deion takes a long look in the mirror at his part in raising such an entitled, disrespectful kid. Maybe they can retire his Jackson State jersey and that'll get him drafted
The hate is real
It's not the player, it's the Father
I wonder how much of this is the so called 'Deion' tax? Teams don't want to deal with him so they pass on Shedeur.
If a team drafts Shedeur, how many .500 or below .500 seasons does the coach get before the fans start to turn and ask for Deion?
I'm so glad this is happening to him. He has a huge ego and tried dictate terms he wants. This is all because of his father.
You can tell who on this desk is in the content business and just trying to stoke narratives and conspiracies (Rich) and who is just grounded in reality (Jeremiah)
That child Shadeur lost me the time he would not shake the other team's QBs hand after the game. LOW CHARACTER
Hell with the NFL and go become a Head Coach at a HBCU it all stars at home send your kids to black schools and send them to your own leagues  And eventually, you’ll be able to start your own football leagues we gotta start changing the narrative stop begging for a sit at their table build our own   Just imagine if basketball players would stop playing in the NBA and get behind Ice Cube three on three basketball league have other black billionaires millionaires sponsorship   We have the the money the resources to create our own. We just come up with excuses while we can’t.
Absolutely send his dad a message.   Dad sat there and said he doesn't want his son playing for some teams...  Also, they were afraid of his money demands.
Imagine rookie Shadeur getting sacked at a high rate, like David Carr or Caleb Williams?  You don't think Deion will get onto social media and slay the GM for not drafting/paying for linemen? Prime Time will be up in there.  Now, your GM, HC, and the whole organization are being questioned by a football legend. Who wants that?!?
Rich knows it's BS!
sander is a better person than russel wilson. i agree with rich eisen  is right sevral players in the nfl ran there mouht during combine against him just because of his dad. shame on the nfl
They make the laws, they print money, they gave you Jesus,  and now they showing who's the boss. They want him to beg. F outta here
Shout out to Rich. Spot on and to not acknowledge it it's disingenuous and intellectually dishonest. He's being Kaepernicked.
All shedeuer did was work
Is he black royalty? Is he entitled? And what about equity in the NFL?
Long gone?  His earliest real evaluation from NFL scouts was late 2nd round talent to the 3rd round.  After that it's his failed interviews, especially important for QBs.
The NFL can't handle the truth. Why can't it be public?
Rich Eisen is spot on!
Wyte is right
People stop supporting the NFL . What they're doing to Sanders is so wrong and disgusting
It would be hilarious if he goes undrafted. Does he go back to CU to continue playing daddy ball? If so what # does he wear? Do they pull the 2 down from the rafters? The kids play does not match his outward attitude. He believes himself to be on par with Brady, Montana, Manning, Elway,..... he's delusional like all you clowns out there encouraging it. Tom Brady tired to help Shedeur back when the dummy posted the video driving his new phantom. He told him to get in the film room and stop the social media nonsense. Shedeur and Deion just laughed at Tom and you could see in that moment Tom's thoughts on Shedeur changed. He saw the kid isn't serious about football, believes himself to be more than he is, and has zero intentions to do what's necessary to become a goat.
A couple of names which pop into my head: Craig James interfering with his son's coach/program.  Odell Beckam Sr. posting on social media Baker Mayfield passes. Who wants that?!? Rich is 100% wrong when he says the team/coach he lands with should, 'control their own program/locker room'.  Whether the team is right or wrong, The Sanders Media Machine will roast them in the court of public opinion (and led by RE showing "support" for his home skillet, Dieon). The only outcome that Deion and Shadeur will think is fair, is him starting and 55 attempts per game. Everything short of that will be malfeasance. (ooooh. other parents who ALMOST ruined their child's career- LaVar Ball and King Richard Williams)
Rich needs to stop letting his emotions dictate his analysis
The same league that has no problem with ben rothlesiberger playing after taping a gurl ray lewis after he murder soneone u have a problem with this kid cause hes confident ? They just want people to follow suit in the ncaa and the nfl
13-12 record 1-8 against ranked teams Zero Conference titles Zero CFP appearances Zero National titles Zero bowl game wins If his last name wasn't Sanders ESPN would not have gassed him up so hard these past two years.
Shedeur shouldn't have to beg!!!!!!
He went from top 10 pick .. to undrafted 🤔.. he’s never been in any trouble, teammates love him , and he’s very religious.. but he has character issues 😂😂
Medaling fathers need to back off their sons career. They always seem to ruin it for them. I get it you love your son but they have to be their own man and figure it out without your interference. Bronny, Ball, etc. be humble and let your actions speak louder than your words.
Y does he have to apologize. This is do stupid
He was always a 4th round player… the only reason anyone ever mentioned him as a first rounder is because of the insane media frenzy surrounding him… it was always really dumb people being really dumb… so now that their insanity didn’t just manifest into reality they have no idea what to say… name another FCS transfer that went 13-12 as a starter in D1, who went 1-8 vs ranked teams in his career, who is short, doesn’t have a great arm, holds the ball way too long, blames his teammates when the lose, name another player like that who went in the first round?
This morning, Deion and the boys are on camera saying, this ain't GOD, this is the DEVIL.  Those guys do not have a clue.
Atlanta Falcons will take him today
Sanders / Kaepernick 2.0 (Enjoy your Humble Pie while in Canada)
Take a shot everytime Rich says "narrative." Yes, Rich, ALL of the teams got it wrong.  Sometimes the A T T I T U D E just isn't worth it.
No uppity n  Jalen Hurts was the first quarterback with a black mom and significant other win a Superbowl.  Doug Williams wife died, then he was allowed to win.  Russell Wilson won whenever he had a white wife cheating on him. When he got divorced and a quasi black wife, nope.    After Jalen Hurts expect a backlash.  There will be no hits too late.   It's not personal.  It's public policy.
The white commentators (except for Rich) are telling Sanders to put his head down and beg like a good little boy.  SMH
Teams are picking based on their needs. I don't buy this conspiracy against the Sanders family. Do you really think teams would intentionally hurt themselves to send a message. Maybe Deion should have toned it down, but that's impossible it's Neon Deion.
The scuttlebutt I’ve heard is that his interviews were beyond terrible and that he’s a head case. It’s gotta be something more than just the Sanders Family Circus and their baggage.
This popped up in my feed, so I figured "why not".... just served to remind me of why I unsubscribed last year.
THIS IS A PERSONAL ATTACK ON THE SANDERS FAMILY. I'M SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THE NFL. THEY'RE CHEATING THE FANS OF GREATNESS. HECK, NO BODY IS TALKING ABOUT WHO GOT DRAFTED. THE BIGGEST STORY IS ABOUT THE PERSON THAT HASN'T BEEN DRAFTED. THAT'S THE PRIME AFFECT, HE'S GOING TO FILL SEATS, HE'S ALREADY FILLING SEATS. THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SITTING AROUND WAITING FOR HIM TO GET DRAFTED ARE THE SAME MILLIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BUY MERCHANDISE AND TUNE IN TO THE TEAM HE'S PLAYING FOR TO SEE HOW HE PLAYS SOMEBODY HAS TO GET SMART AND PICK THIS MAN AND STOP BEING PETTY.
Steelers who they have? Browns have 3 backups. They just got the 94 pick and instead of Howard or sanders they got some guy that i dont remember his name. What is going on
If rich eisen would like his opinion to matter then he can go get a job in some front office
Amazing how clueless Rich Eisen still is!
Hay Rich, Rich Eisen, I tipped my hat to you. Thank you for not being so "football-ee" with this Shedeur matter and saying exactly what this black balling is all about. And you BJ, he doesn't need to beg no one but God, the Sanders family don't need to beg even if he doesn't get drafted at all and that is what it looks like at this point. He can go and coach with his dad, he doesn't need to beg to get on that plantation period!
His father said he wants to coach his son in the NFL.   You not drafting just the player.  You drafting another coach into the coaching room
No reason he shouldn't get picked today based off talent alone. If you're a competent organization you can work with him
@1:48 what about Johnny Money Manziel, Baker Mayfair and ect? This guy is BS. And why Shedeur to be the one who has to call and beg for the job ? This is insane
No one knows all that transpired.  I get that.  But there is an obvious pain point that caused folks to pass.  He is not a backup.  Get him in Steelers camp and if the pain point does not show up, he is your starter.
Will any team ever really be honest about it all? Doubtful! All 32 teams wouldn't just pass on a solid QB prospect...especially if they need one. If Deion wasn't his coach and his father...where would the kid be rated then?
On well off media Vlog he was pranked called on a phone that was issued to him from the league. He thought it was a GM from the saints…. they playing him
Typical woke Rich.
Sanders led all of college in completion percentage, over 4000 yards and 37 td’s. This makes no sense? Shouldn’t all qb’s have confidence and strong egos? Comes with the position. Should of been top 5 pick
Mayfield and Manziel were cocky, arrogant, braggadocious, you name it but they went fairly early. But Shedeur needs to dim his light, funny how that works 🤔. Its definitely personal against Deion and his namesake.
Sanders is an egotistical joke. Its not only the so called "baggage" that Dion brings. Its the fact that Shaduer is NOT a team guy. He was always throwing his teammates under the bus for any of the major losses. No team wants that kind of cancer in the locker room. I'll put money that he ends up in Dallas.
Rich Eisen and Charles Davis is awesome. Dude is the only one speaking truthful and not beating around the bush.
How naive can these guys be? Or are they afraid of Shaduers dad? Forget about bringing cameras, he's a grown man bringing daddy. No other grown man in the league has a Lavar Ball type dad crying at every corner . After the first round he already started crying online coming after people.... So as soon as he feels his son isnt playing or getting used correctly he's gonna start bashing everyone again lol NO ORGANIZATION WANTS THAT OR NEEDS THAT
Only in Amwrikkka ✊🏾
Sanders family getting a little taste of reality.
Michael Sam vibes surrounding Shedeur, outside hype not convincing front offices he can play 😢
HUMBLE🤔🤔🤔🤔
Teams don't want Shaddeur because of his overrated dad. They know it's going to be Tebow Drama 2.0... doubled.
If any team thought they could win with Sanders, they would have drafted him.   The question should be, why do they think they can without him?
This segment is kinda proving them correct. There are damn near 100 different players for them to talk about but the only one they paid attention to is Shadeur. His fame is superseding his talent. Teams don't want that.
Bad interview, saying he'll only play for certain teams, skipping the combine, east vs west game and so on. When Daddy isn't callin the shots for him funny how/what people act think of him truely shows. He did this to himself
I love how rich eisen keep it 100. This is all personal.
Rich is a real one for this always respected him
A little humble pie will be good for him long term. It’s good for everyone in these days of greed!
Well he technically did something "legendary"
The hate of the Sanders family is crazy ..Have you guys ever heard of a QB Johnny football Manzail he was parting all thru college wasnt a problem for him
No coach wants to have Dion taking his job as a possible narrative
They answered their own question. How many guys got picked tonight and fulfilled their lifelong dreams and these guys spent 90% of the time talking about the guy who didn’t get picked. That’s the same distraction he would be on any team that he is on.
Ha Ha the kid thinks hes better than he is😂😂So did deion he said top 5😂😂Meanwhile in the 4th round...... NOTHING 😂😂😂😂😂
This man said beg for A job!!!!
I’m a retired fireman. I got passed over for promotion several times despite out performing 95% of my peers. The reason after reflection, is that I was perceived as being arrogant and cocky. There’s a fine line between being cocky and confident. I never implemented the term to….Never outshine the Master.
They want to butt break him and have him basically thank them for the opportunity that he already earned playing football. This is crazy
Hes NOT talented.    Duh?
Rich is 100% correct. Haters are like “He needs too be humble, it’s ok too blackball Shedeur “ Fans are like “Why are they doing this to Shedeur? Must be because of his dad “ However you look at it, it happened.
Just a cry baby session over a 5th round talent 👍👍got it
Crazy your obsession with someone who isn't even a top 100 pick. Let it go. The kid isn't worth it for these teams. They don't want an immature kid who brings drama. 32 teams keep passing on him. Let that sink in. Your narrative is questionable.
No one cares and this will be non-news in two weeks. Move on.
Weak QB draft class this year. Cameron Ward is a legit #1 pick. All other QBs are late 3rd round and later. I'm surprised the other QBs were picked so high, but Sanders is falling to where his talents put him. Sanders isn't really fast or elusive and he doesn't have the size and arm strength of a pocket QB. He can be accurate and smart and those skills can eventually take him far, but he's getting drafted right about where he should.
Rich is definitely biting his tongue and trying to keep it professional but he's absolutely right this entire thing is bullshit. You can't say we don't know what their main motive is but then give the advice to come in Humble with your tail tucked in. That is the weirdest power play these teams want to portray
C'mon man. He is obviously being black-balled.  This is not good for the NFL. This looks like IYKYK 😮.  We have to stop covering up the obvious and address people doing stuff like this and talking around it. He is a good kid and has gone through this on every level. He is arguably the best QB in the draft and has had no off-field issues. All the players that have got in that have actually done crimes literally, and we are hiding behind it. Is it a character issue? Being confident is a character issue? We are buck breaking in 2025? This is wild. They will lose fans behind this.
I never seen the league be this blatant with trying to prove a point. They're literally draft criminals and 30+ players over their hate  with the Sanders family. That's crazy.
I dont think the Cowboys would let him go undrafted, Deion would call Jerry even if they trade him later after pre season games and some QB gets hurt and he looks good in preseason
They Are Black Balling Shedur Sanders
You guys spent waaay too much air on deon's kid. I switched channels hours ago.
YOU AINT NEVER PUT ON A HELMET PLEASE BE QUIET AND SIT DOWN SOMEWHERE
I think that Sanders will remain unpicked after the last day of the draft.  Shedeur lacks the talent to ever see any playing time.  Teams and coaches also don't want Deon analyzing and commenting on their games.
I think Dion telling the media that his son was not going to play for a bad team to try and play politics on draft day is WHY he hasn't been picked yet .
If you draft the son…you get the dad as a package deal. You can’t have dad coaching the son away from the team and causing a disruption….which may happen.
S.Sanders, could be the first player to have his jersey retired by his university and not be drafted at all.. what’s that say about him or the university..
Shedeur not being drafted is great for the NFL…..MORE viewers will be watching the Saturday selections to see when Sanders will be picked! It’s a genius marketing strategy!! 😂
Rich gets it! This is personal and the Sanders. Why are these guys dancing around it
Tough spot for Rich, very very close with Deion.  But also, Shadeur is annoying AF.  All his dad's bravado without the charisma.
This is reminiscent of the Ball basketball family and the hype and $shoes.
I love how ESPN and all these talking heads are acting like this is a national tragedy 😂 this is what happens when you are talented but not great. Didn't win a single big game. When you lost you blamed your teammates. You hold on to the ball and take unnecessary sacks to preserve your completion percentage. Your dad yaps before the draft that we will only play for certain teams, does nothing at the combine, interviews with teams poorly, wants to bring in an entire personal film crew into the locker room, any head coach will undoubtedly here the "he doesn't know how to use Shadeur, they need Dieon" after he plays poorly. It's not worth the headache to teams as he's not a franchise turning QB talent
I have watched sanders play the reason he is not drafted is because he.s not that great he's an ok player and he had his stats padded by his dad.
Not being drafted because your a college star is wild! Lemelo ball!
If the league were really about talent, Kaepernick would have been playing the last 10 years. Screw these little princesses. McCarver was right about Deion. No one likes a guy who gives himself a nickname. Prime... what a douche.
These teams need a quarterback though New Orleans so what yall talking about he is good they seen the films
Daddy's name aint enough. He gonna have to go get it on his own. Oh well. Travis and Cam and Ashton did it. He can too. He just gonna have to get it on merit not dads legacy.
Oh your friend for a few years and training partner , we'll pick him #1 even though you had arguably a better 2 seasons given the talent around you both sides of the ball , we'll humiliate you by not picking you because we're the brand
What Joel Klatt is saying is stupid, everyone knows its personal and they are trying to break the kid down because of his name, a black man standing up for his son is not respected and not acceptable because the bs about black fathers in this country. As a father of a son, Deion has not done anything that Archie Manning did for his sons and it was applauded. Stop the foolishness Shedeur hold you head up.
Hey if he’s still around for the Dolphin’s next pick I hope they take him
Jeez…Rich is so thick headed on this. He’s been pushing Shedeur forever. Bro, every team passed three times….something isn’t right
Rich is the only one being real.
Love of Money and Love of Self !
Yall listen to the words of that clown is the red suit this is how that want us to act
Oh cry me a river. So all 32 teams collectively decided to not draft Sanders purely because they want to spite him and his dad? Sure, good luck trying to get anyone with half a brain to believe that. After all the drama filled and criminal players that have had excuses made for them by teams coaches and owners that played in the NFL, I don’t buy that victim narrative for a second.
Doubt that anyone cares to become More of a Reality Show than a Football Team ? Drama Hurts team cohesion ? Deion a Drama Black Hole ?  ?  🤔
By drafting Shedeur Sanders you’d be getting a crazy circus hitched to a tornado!🌪️
HEY RICH YOU ARE SELF MADE! FEEL FREE TO ALL OUT THE COLLUSION!
Every team is doing social media but it’s controlled by the organization not a rookie with his own people tromping all over the property shaping their own narrative.
Salute to Eisen for pushing back on the old boys club !!! Forever got my respect after this
Sheduer is a sweet kind young man what the heck you guys talking about Travis hunter had more problems with that girlfriend
Sit down...be humble. The guy says.
Wow , because a young black man with talent has a strong black positive successful dad … Sheduer can’t have confidence in himself and his abilities.. HE SHOULD BEG ???!!’
Yeah, maybe just maybe, he came off as a massive douchebag to everybody who met him?  It's either they couldn't stand his personality or he's not as good as everybody thinks he is.
No franchise wants him as their face of the franchise....they'll risk less talent.
Teams do not want a circus.
Look likes Trey Lance... As a 49ers fan, Teams don't want that
The dolphins should have drafted him knowing tua god dam concussion issue.
Good ole boys network! They just want him AND his dad to bow down and kiss the ring
The Sad Saga of Shedur Sanders is just some gabble to take up bandwidth till summer camp opens. Nobody actually cares about Prime's Little Boy being blackballed on the big money contracts and cares even less about what Papa Prime thinks about it. The kid has become the NFL's Jaden Smith [aka 'Will Smith's little boy']
Racism had to happen just because the draft is in Green Bay
Can we hear Rick Eisen talk without being talked over
Everyone is saying, by talent Sheduer should have been drafted by now.... what talent??? Outside of having the best qb release, and maybe the best accuracy of this class, what traits wows you? He doesn't have a cannon for an arm. His footwork is sloppy at best. His timing is worse that Sam Darnold coming into the league, and his athleticism for an NFL athlete is mid at best. He doesn't have single trait that wows like any of the other qbs in this class... and in any other year, he would be a day 3 prospect
Last I checked, none of these four talking heads owns a team.
If it’s true that he took a FaceTime call during an interview…wow
"Push back on"
They are the antithesis of humble yet they bring God into their hubris. Good luck with that. He's entitled, spoiled..let him sit.
Says coach and organization should be able to control the narrative. The media is the problem they create and destroy as they choose.
Rich why are you taking this so personal? You talk about how long you've been doing this and I've never heard you act like this. Shedeur is not a starting QB and the NFL teams just said it.
i don't think there was nothing shedeur could've done to prevent this. there was a narrative already. it went from oh he got the starting job because of his dad to well he's entitled to he's arrogant and then eventually it went towards his play which we've seen him play at a high level and be very good at a high level. i saw it from a mile away when the anonymous source came out. plus i do believe the opinions about him are biased. nobody is giving him a fair assessment. you cant say his play was bad. he was litterally one of the top qbs in college football...
We have owners of teams out here that have done things and you guys are speaking about image, really!  We have leaders that have done unspeakable things and some of you are not bothered by them at all.
Its not shadeur that these teams don't want. They don't want his dad meddling with their organizations.
America is full of athletes of Allstar Parents that try and don't make it to the "Show". The fact that Shedeur came out and publicly thanked, God...Shedeur will be just fine.
25 years ago, April 16, 2000 Tom Brady was drafted in the 6th round NFL Draft by the New England Patriots and then proceeded to win 7 Superbowls 2002,2004,2005,2015,2017, 2019 & 2021
Klatt is preaching
One word that fd him up = “entitlement”  his camp cannot say he doesn’t want to go where. Keep that in private .. super sad, Top QB in this class
He’s a back up qb who comes with a lot of drama if he doesn’t play.  It’s the Tim Tebow effect - no one wants a QB2 who’s got cameras around him creating distractions for the team.
They all talking about they confused.. the devil is confusion
Eisen putting everything into context
The Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey and The Sanders Family all popular family circus acts that have faded away without sustainability due to no true talent base to offer. 🤡
One thing not being addressed is the lack of teams looking for a QB in the first three rounds, which limited QB picks to begin with. Many of those needing a QB had other needs to address in the first three rounds. That said, the QB position is one where the fit has to be perfect for things to play out with positive notes, and many of the teams that passed on Shedeur just didn't see it for whatever reasons, and his dad certainly was part of evaluating that fit. Collusion by the NFL is a definite possibility, but proving it is another story. I think Pittsburgh will take a QB in this fourth round, and I'd like to see them take Shedeur.
His going undrafted The problem it's His dad and press friends intervention nobody wants that special the owners
His dad did this to him.  He's getting what he asked for. Deion stated who's teams he didn't want his son to go to. Which is his right. The teams are give him what he wants. The teams that he didn't want his son to go to, won't bother picking him. And the teams that he wanted his son to go to  have already had plans on who they need. If your gonna tell me you don't want to be on my team, why would I pick u.
Coaches are afraid if they draft sanders, then Deion will have their jobs in a year or less.
5:49 Transition : pick up the phone and beg lol
Just off the top of my head Quin Ewers and Will Howard are still 2 qb’s that are better picks
The kid and his dad have zero humility and are examples of everything that's bad in any society, and the younger son is even worse than the two of them.
Colorado didn't really blow their Conference away and they were not in the Best Conferences... The Best player on the Team got Drafted... I don't see the problem
Playing exclusively for your Dad as a QB through HS and college is not a good idea. Full Stop.
The NFL IS A 32 TEAM PLANTATION. WITH SAVAGE DEVIL OWNERS!😮
Sanders is not that good and it’s come home to roost and the baggage isn’t worth it.
The elephant in the room is Shedeur's social media power.  He is a walking production company, a reality show star with NFL talent.  "We coming" means Shedeur and his production entourage.
Beg them!!!!!?😮
Rich is losing his mind because he’s obsessed with celebrity and he badly wants the soap opera circus to get into the league so he can talk about them and the cowboys everyday.
The Team wants to control the message, not the player
I just can’t believe… I don’t feel there’s ever been an instance in HiSTORY, that there hasn’t been a single comment, not a single word out of Deion’s mouth.
Can you imagine drafting Shadeur then having Deion roam your front office buildings complaining how come you are running these plays, or why isnt he starting yet.  Man, what a massive headache he would be.
It’s been people who beat women get drafted
These are just rumors and narratives. People, its not that serious!
Gee Rich, you are performing more Hasbara than the actual Colorado alum that usually ball washes the Sanders.
This got me sick with the NFL right now..I get the bs passin on him in the 1st round but after that is diabolical
“That rich kid and his wealthy family are being persecuted! I’m appalled!” - Rich Eisen (probably) Never expected Rich to be such a shill for the Sanders family. Embarrassing.
Shedur is a bum.   And zero nfl GMs want to deal with deion or his entitled mediocre brat
Part of me feels this is a ploy to get people tuned in EVEN MORE to the draft...
I love Rich, but he's looking stupid.  Sorry, nobody likes your friends son as QB.  Get over it.
Im still baffled by the behavior of these sports "journalists." Nboody cares about the narrative you're pushing.
The time to sell yourself was the past 3 months,  if a player is just realizing that right now.. its too late.  The time has past.
Rich, I appreciate you keeping it 💯.
Go to Canada Black balled
Maybe all the undeserved hype and glazing from ESPN et al aren't very helpful to him?  If you forget the name on the jersey and just watch him actually play, you'd notice that nothing about him suggests anything more than a 3rd-4th round pick.  Middling arm, no speed/athleticism, has trouble playing on time.  He's a decent but not great college QB, aka someone teams will take a flyer on in later rounds as a project.  Teams WILL look past character/personality stuff...for higher level talents than this.
Self relection for what??? And WTF is this begging Talk???
Rich is a real one
Rich not trying to hear this bs 😂 the nfl is the blind to red flag league fo sho
So typical.. Blacks are claiming its because of his race.. My god so sick of it.. They scream racism even when that Anthony kid killed the white student in a racist attack an it was a hate crime.. so it doesn't matter what they'll claim, racism is brought in it.. Im Just done with it the BS.. They can't just except that sanders just not good for a team..
I call it Steelers take shadeur in 4th round
9:55 everybody looks at him like u know you sound racist and religiously intolerant with this view. Backups get the mic when they’re obviously better than the starter. Sounds Hate train ridden
Dude in the burgundy has no clue.
He’s just not that great! There’s still qb’s on the board that actually played at big programs and won big games.
Browns got standards now?
Deion is a clown! Is son is not good enough. Be honest
The hell with the NFL bs
Nobody wanted another diva on their team. A constant distraction.  Who goes and complains on his dad podcast every week. Talent is everything when you need handles to look after them.
Telling him to bend the knee is crazy
Rich is too old... Jalen Hurts beat the just talented QB ever and it wasn't close... There's too much talent or there to voluntarily bring in that hurricane
Arrogance is a bad look
This is looking more like that shameful episode of the  NFL's colustion ban of COLIN KAEPERNICK🏈🏈🏈
How about the fact he's just not that good
They are humbling him
If he's anything like his dad (and right now it appears that he's EXACTLY like his dad), then he's not CAPABLE of "self-reflection"
Rich is not allowing these guys to gaslight him. If you think about all trouble other players have gotten themselves into, and the coaches and upper management have look the other way. It's all about bending the knee!
He's not that talented, from an athletic standpoint in the NFL. He's ranked like 14th from the NFL in athletic QB ability in this draft
This is all DEI and if he was good and not having padded stats in a dismal season records he would have went earlier.. don’t believe these people there almost 50 telling the truth and 50 telling what’s going to keep there job…
Daniel Jeremiah's advice is absolutely legit
Hahahahahahahaha  Shadier is just a hype machine  He played jackson state. Cmon Colorado. Sucked first year, better second but took what, a hundred sacks?  Not mobile, average arm  Hes not a game changer. Hes a superstar in his own mind.  Go back and learn some more  Brady said it well.  Study more tape and dont worry about your rolls royce!!
There’s also a couple areas the public doesn’t get to see that teams do. Medical and background checks. Maybe there’s concerns with either of those
Man is Brandon annoying af
Joel Klatt is A hater
Could the problem be Dion said him and his son are a package deal? I know I heard rumours of that  months ago that went away after a bit. But.....
You want the fan fare. Shedeur equals money
it is called the LEBRON EFFECT. JAMES being powerful got his son drafted when everyone can see he isn't NBA talent or ready along with being a strong Black Father basically doing what white society been doing because of this the next time the chance came the example was going to be made. Along the fact both are supported by NIKE see James did his sacrifice remember he was going to Diddy parties 🥳. NOT SANDERS so he son had to be made a example because truth is nobody without power every thought Bronny was going to the NBA. SEE Lavar Ball was called crazy because his support and love for his boy's and society was Happy when his middle son screw his chance stealing. So you get Deion not going through gatekeepers to become a coach and almost became Cowboys coach See Deion should had went and left college to the pro to give both of you sons a chance. But he felt the work and name was enough  NOT WHEN YOU DONT OWN A TEAM AND NOT WORTH BILLIONS. SOCIETY DOESNT WANT OR LIKE STRONG BLACK MEN OR STRONG BLACK FAMILIES ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE WHICH GETS CALLED COCKIE. FOR EVERYONE GOING WITH THE NARRATIVE SHOWS HOW BRAINWASHED THE WORLD IS THIS RACISM. LASTLY BEFORE YOU COMMENT BACK I RECOMMEND READING ABOUT WILLY LYNCH HOW TO DESTROY THE BLACK FAMILY. ONE LAST THING JAMES JUST DID A SHOE WITH SANDERS YOU WOULD THINK LEBRON WOULD SHOW SUPPORT NOT A SINGLE WORD AND I DONT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT HE IS HOOPING HELL HE MADE TIME FOR KEVIN GATES. IF IT WALK LIKE A CHICKEN CHIRPS LIKE A CHICKEN 🐔 ITS A CHICKEN. THIS IS CALLED THE (LEBRON EFFECT)
No way! The same league that manipulated Eli going to the Giants from the Chargers? No way…I cannot believe that. 😂😂
Its wild how these guys can sit here and say things like "shadeur probably cant help but take this personal" when all we've heard is how horrible his personality is and he also is just a guy whos not that good.  Hes just to arrogant, entitled, coddled, and has no self awareness.
Bull Parcels didn't have to deal with social media or Deion Sanders as the kids dad @richeisen
What team wants the Prime Time Circus all up in there business 24/7 much less Little Prime acting the fool? Obviously none.
Bro dude talking bout red flags dumb af.
Let’s be honest…. It’s the billionaire white men hatin on the Sanders!! We don’t have to act like a Tom Brady…. We are black and don’t act like you chumps. He’s better than 90% of the guys who were drafted
Part of this is a result of when Johnny Manziel was drafted. Especially for Cleveland. His character isn't as bad as Johnny, but weaker arm strength while holding onto the ball too long. Doesn't have "escapability". Sanders should take this as motivation, and just go to work once he's drafted.
Kid is Tebow/Kaep 2.0, the talent ain't worth the circus.
Wow I used to have some respect for Rich, but this is easily one of the dumbest takes in sports media and that is hard to do. It's one thing to take a player that seems like high drama, and adding on a dad that is high drama makes it worse but not terrible if they don't have media contacts which the super majority of people don't. Deion has all the media contacts, front office contacts at league headquarters, contacts on every team when contract negotiations come up. For Rich to think it's just controling a few cameras in a lock room is either willfully lying about the real risks, or has learned nothing in his time in media or with NFL. Deion can go around to his contacts and whip up all sorts of problems and he is known to cause locker room problems and contraversey. No smart team would welcome this risk unless he was a muilti heisman winner with champioship success. He is not so the teams are being smart. The risk is so high I am not sure where the value even is. Could teams in the 6th still pass on him? Since the risk doesn't decrease by round just the cost that's hard to say.
Bruh this just got personal
The media is to blame. They built Sanders into this second coming, when the reality is the NFL saw him for what he truly is…. Mediocre. His stats and mechanics said it all to GM’s.
@5:46 We not BEGGING we making them PAY!
Why is rich struggling to grasp this
THE SPIRIT IF BILL POLIAN REMAINS. This is sad.
Rich is a no-nothing fool
Kinda reminds me of Vontaze Burfict. He was a projected 1st rounder early in the process, but he has disastrous team interviews and goes undrafted as a result.
Look i like him, but he thinks he’s his father.   He’s arrogant you’re not ur father this isn’t the 90s look at Travis he’s not u personality wise.   You a fool your going to the fourth and tbh you deserve better but ur personality is not that guy
Tom Brady was drafted in the 6th round. This league continues to show us proof they dont know how to evaluate talent
so apparently Rich would hire anyone no matter how much drama and problems they brought with them because he could "manage them" ....yeah okay buddy
Really one winning season ain’t enough….
It's one kid, and these people are freeking out 😂😂😂
The way these guys are trying to say that this isn’t personal is crazy.
Rich is so soft. If teams don’t want a player then they don’t want him. It’s that simple.
Teams are getting smart that this "culture" of the Sanders family may look fun but is unprofessional and breeds bad work habits
I think the NFL teams are sending a message. " Don't ram your  players down our throats "
Those who are making decisions as to who is chosen or not Shedeur should have been chosen before a number of those that were telling the truth many of those decisions are made by idiots who have no idea what they are doing perfect example the worst team in the league the Cleveland Brothers they had previously chosen a quarterback paying him big money but he didn’t perform half the time he was supposed to have not performed due to injuries and being accused of disrespecting a number of women while he was being massaged those who choose for that team made an excellent decision choosing the one they have paid big money for while he only showed his skills disrespecting women and relaxing while injured Shut up plenty of those making decisions don’t know what they’re doing accept reality they don’t have a clue who should be chosen yet Shedeur is  a better player and man than that player who they paid big money for and has done nothing but cause the team to be the number 1 loosing team in the NFL I would love to express my thoughts to all those jealous ignorant decision makers consumed with hatred not qualified to make any important decisions because of not having knowledge or experience to make the right decisions.
Rich eisen makes a good point players with red flags get second chances all the time say what you want about Sanders but he's a four-year starter
Maybe teams don’t trust him to learn and play outside of his daddy’s bubble and system optimized for him?
Rich doesn’t want to get stabbed in the tent….
Deon Call uncle Jerry now!!!! ASAP!!!! Sheduer is a kid. Dont get him caught up in your world of White mans but hurt feeling ....
Rich bootlicking Deon
But to be fair to Shedeur and the point about being a distraction as a back up QB. That’s not entirely on Shedeur, the media is going to be asking everyone on the team “how’s Shedeur playing? Do you think he should be the starter…..” and the media sensation he’s become teams are asking if they want to deal with that…..
The Sanders drop has increased Draft television ratings ten fold!
DANIEL, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD A WHITE POTENTIAL HIGH DRAFT TO CALL GM'S AND "BEG" FOR THEM TO DRAFT HIM. I WILL NO LONGER WHAT THE NFL NETWORK DRAFT COVERAGE EVER. THANK YOU RICH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THESE ARE THE SAME OWNERS WHO COLLUDED AGAINST COLIN DANIEL...
He’s Getting Black Balled
Honest question. Would Shedeur even have been talked about as much if Deion wasn’t his Dad?  I don’t see elite QB when I watch him. He’s not tall or stout. He’s not fast (certainly an underwhelming athlete when you consider his Dad). His arm isn’t big. How much of his success was because he was backyard balling with the best player in college football?  I don’t see a lot of offensive success within structure.   I think the paid evaluators have made it pretty clear he isn’t a franchise QB. And I think the tape shows that.   So then you start looking at value later in the draft. Do you want the headache that comes along with him if he’s a backup or developmental player?  I wouldn’t.   If his last name was Harris nobody would give a rip.
Nice kid and Jesus loves him, but He's overrated. Who retires a Jersey without a championship? He doesn't belong in the NFL..
In my opinion this is rediculous. There is no way Sanders is not ready and not a starter in this league. At this point this needs to stop.
Just wait till teams start failing and failing. They gonna be calling Shedeur begging to come play for them. That’s a guarantee
The Raiders are gonna pick him up now. I think he’s been humbled and will learn from Geno
There is nothing nefarious going on. There is a difference between picking a guy whos gotten in trouble before in his life. I think nobody wants Sanders BS. Did you see how upset he was  then  he giggled like a school girl when his friend put himself down to uplift sanders
This reminds me of the Lonzo Ball fiasco w/ his dad, in a way.
Sanders is just not that good. The media was hyping smoke, not fire. PLEASE let this be an L take / age poorly. I want to be wrong, but he struggled vs good college defenses, and the worst NFL defense are better than that.
Rich sounds like a fan boy
Nobody to blame but him and his dad. The sad part is they’ll sit there in their echo chamber and blame everyone else. Deion won’t begin to think, “maybe I shouldn’t have sat on national media and say how we have power to turn teams down, that I won’t allow him to play for”  Oh, so we have to deal with two grown men divas? The one we’re buying don’t throw that good and can barely read a defense? The extra jersey sales are worth it.   Hey Shedeur, welcome to the NFL, oh wait,
Goes to show all the talking heads do not know it all like they think they do !!,Humble pie is served !!
Every quarterback drafted so far is less talented than Sanders.... and will not fill the seats and bring in money on merch like Sanders will either...
Shedeur Sanders is not having a fun 48 hours.
If an organization cannot control their organization then they are not leaders. Real leaders don’t get bothered by “distractions”.  Whichever city he goes to will absorb millions in revenue. That’s a good distraction.
So you want him to beg the white man for a job .. 😂😂Nope don't 🙅‍♂️ do it shaduer
This is showing how terrible NFL is want to send a kid a message because he confident and believes in his self. You see that an want to humble him that's weird. You rather draft less talented people to send a message that's weird. I hop Shedeur never changes and proves everyone wrong.
Black Turtle Neck Rich is an absolute unit!!!!!
Joel is correct!!
Eisen is proving why every org is doing what they are doing….. no matter what, wherever he goes this is what will consume all the airspace of that organization…. NO ONE wants this.
Listen to all the trigger words
All QB''s are a risk.What we do know where a Sanders goes the circus follows.Teams got more to worry about than what Deon thinks about what there doing.Hey Deon you were tollerated because of your extrodinary tallent you were never loved.
“Self reflection” not a white man telling a black man “stay in your place boy!” I’ll never watch the nfl ever again.
There were multiple draft analysts who said Shedeur was a 3rd round pick, so him going undrafted wasn't surprising to me  PS: also people are forgetting that Shedeur has only played for his father his entire career
Shedeur Kaepernick
Shedeur is in a unique position that no one has experienced before, and he can leverage it to become a bigger star than he could have ever imagined. Against All Odds
No body wants a showboating ice watch flexing cocky like I'm better than you player on their team PERIOD. He's a good quarterback but NOT that good to risk the drama that comes with the Saunders brand.
He's 6 foot with a noodle arm that can't read defenses. He would have been a 4th round pick last year. I don't understand what the problem is
I don’t remember this much shilling and apologizing and rudely insulting every NFL team without an established QB-1 over a rookie QB falling in the draft…..ever.  WTF kind of hold on the NFL and establishment sports media does Deon Sanders have???
Wins:diva drama ratio in Colorado was too outta whack for anyone to think the dude was more than a media storyline, unless youre in the media.
So shedur has to beg to be  drafted wow
If Sandra's had acted like that phone call you're talking about when he actually met them in person he would have already been drafted because that's not him
Yeah, there weren't many teams in the QB market ... and he clearly pissed them all off. This is on him.
What off-the-field stuff? DUI's? Beating his girlfriend? Having someone else do his homework in college? Nope. It was that he was TOO black for his team interviews. That ANONYMOUS hit piece is the RED FLAG that he was intentionally torpedoed.
Here is the truth plan and simple. He's not as good as he or everyone thinks he is. The QB is the face the leader of the team and Sanders has none of those traits. Him and his dad spent a year telling other people that they were not good enough to be on there team that went 4-8. They blamed the o-line instead of standing by them and trying to help them get better. He's never been coach by anybody but his dad. Handed everything in life. He's not a leader and he's not talented enough plane and simple. Team's interview him and saw that for themselves he's more concerned about the name on the back of the jersey instead of the one on the front. He can't lead a team only blame it when it doesn't go his way.
Rich wasn’t feeling that bull😂😂
Hmmm. So the market does not care about hype and pays for the product in question? Imagine that.
I told everyone he's no better than a backup QB, and I got a lot of hate for it. Well it turns out I was right. Now that he's only viewed as a backup no-one wants him because who needs all that baggage he brings for a backup QB!
Deion said “shedeur don’t take a backseat to nobody” when asked about last year’s draft. He said he’d be picked ahead of Caleb.
Sanders is just not that good !
When has the pride and joy of all the greats ever really had a truly fair shake? It's a tough one. Been a couple but not really in this era.   But Shedur has now entered a world that hasn't been shaped specifically for him since he held his first ball. It has to be tough.   But people don't forget the childish, immature behaviour and antics that did nothing positive for any of them. Shedur has a lot of maturity, he is poised, and why he's not on the Raiders or Browns right now surprised me. Thought those were good fits possibly.    But I'm a Deion fan for life, always have been since he was in college.
Klatt trying to tell eisen anything is funny. Go home.   His talent was never great. Deion ruined his night.  He was only in the picture bc of daddy.  If he had a different name he wouldn't even be in focus.
This came down to a very simple formula: Talent + Baggage = Draftability (new word). If Cam Ward had Shedeur's baggage, Ward would have still been drafted first. If Shedeur had Cam Ward's talent, Shedeur would have been a first-round pick. You only will assume the baggage if the talent makes it worth it.
Is there something Im missing. McCord and Ewers have better arm talent. I watched the Syracuse tape versus Miami. Some of those throws he made in that game was elite.
First time i heard Rich Eisen sound ridiculous... Travis Hunter is a generational talent and would have been drafted top 5 no matter who coached him. Not to mention he is humble and has a certain personality teams want.. You cant compare the 2 cause its not even close...
Dion - “there are some teams we won’t play for “ NFL- ok
I usually agree with Rich but there is no protecting players from the media in today’s NFL.
Daddy ball backfired
This is the Cam Newton effect. Cam could easily be the best backup in the NFL. And I still think he could start for a few teams. But teams aren’t gonna bring a big personality in to be a backup. The backup is supposed to be behind the scenes support of the starter, not a guy who talks to media and tries to compete with the #1 guy.
of all the players Jaxson Dart had the most stable background and would have the least intrusions from the outside
Rich WOKE Eisen has lost me as a fan. Joel Klatt has lost his mind as well. Enough talking about this clown 24/7. There are other kids getting drafted and their dreams happening. Garbage broadcast
Theses white boys want him to beg and that's crazy work and that's why the ratings are down 🤡🗑️
We continue in society to hear that those two words that have absolutely turned Society on its head and that's social media. Its created cowards and insanity.
We didn't really learn anything here.
If you wonder why he hasn’t got drafted yet. It’s on him! He didn’t do anything to help his cause. He didn’t participate in any of the Senior Bowl games, he didn’t participate in the NFL Combine, he didn’t t participate in the Big 12 Pro Day. He talked too much! He has videos on his own YouTube channel where he’s talking about ghosting NFL teams and GMs. All this goes with the interview process. Last thing and the most important thing unfortunately, is that he is PRIMETIME Deion Sanders son. He will be drafted at some point today to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Time for deep reflection for the entire sanders family. Deion’s helicoptering must be a huge turn off too
When you say there are teams he won't play for, you sealed your fate. Nobody wants a selfish arrogant guy running their team because that is not a humble leader. He won't be drafted
Eisen is completely wrong.  no orginization wanted the circus.  he would not be a starter year 1 and no one wanted all the noise week in and week out that would absolutely ruin the team chemistry and derail the starting quarterbacks entire season.
This burgundy suit dude forgot about Deshaun Watson. Those red flags are more reasonable than Bering a bit too cocky? This is a perfect example of these teams leading with their egos.
Folk trying to silence my boy.... Smh
Hell Nawl We Aint Begging for Job 😂
He's not a backup. Just as good as #1 pick but they're talking about backup. Naw.
He’s a distraction……..simple as that. The nfl seen it a million times…….kaepernick was good enough to play again in the nfl. Johnny Football the list goes on and on
Thank you, Rich.
Nobody wants the circus that’s coming to town by drafting Sanders. He just doesn’t have the talent or credentials to tantalize GMs into taking him at a premium. This isn’t a good QB draft class anyway, teams are willing to wait.
This whole situation is collusion.  We have seen far worse QB decisions in NY and Cleveland over the last few years….  Reality is, we will never know what REALLY happened here.  Tebow did not intentionally bring a distraction…..
Sanders is trash. He's not worth the drama. He cannot read defenses
Bruh yall telling this man to “beg” somebody to believe it them is insane. I rather not get drafted idk what yall smoking.
It was the $300k watch for me.  He would bring that watch to games and flash it flauntingly in front of fans of the opposing team. Do NFL players do that? That act alone let me know he was privileged and arrogant.  I knew that this young man would not be a first round draft pick.   We are in uncharted territory with these NIL recipients making millions of dollars before going pro. They better recognize that the league is paying attention to what you do with the money you get. And if you are not managing that in a mature, humble and responsible way, then it will be a strike against you come NFL draft time.   Quarterbacks are held to a higher standard. This young man would be the leader of men. His offensive line would be consisting of grown men with families, and Sanders would be the most immature person on the team? NO team wants that. No team needs that. I wouldn't be surprised if he goes UNDRAFTED.
Deion, “ My sons getting drafted in the top 5, where’s you’re son getting drafted”, 😂😂😂😂😂😂, that didn’t age well.
The thing is the farther he falls, farther he is likely to fall. Teams will just wait each other out
The sanders can only blames themselves for how ARROGANT they parade around. Realistically who wants to deal with that??? Lie if you want but NOBODY.  CONFIDENCE AND ARROGANCE ARE DIFFERENT
To the guys in the media who are pissed and incredulous about this situation -- I get it.  You're buddies with Deion, the family, maybe the kid too.  You've probably known him since he was an infant.  It seems like he's getting a raw deal.  But at the same time none of you seem to want to concede that maybe, just maybe, they brought it upon themselves.
2025 NFL Buck Breaking by the owners is what I call it. I feel very bad for Shedeur. No way he goes from a possible top 3 pick to this bullcrap. Especially after some anonymous white assistant coach supposedly writes all these negative things about Shedeur and doesn’t even have the balls to attach his name to his quotes yet everyone takes his word for it.   The insiders (NFL owners) know who said it but are keeping quiet, that tells me everything. Seeing the Steelers (who I loved) pass up on him as bad as they need a qb told me all I needed to know. Yeah they even got the Rooney's on board, so my respect for the franchise itself is out the window.  There is obviously a mutual agreement by the owners to do this family dirty. He's getting straight Kaepernicked ⚫️ "that's a black ball for the clueless ones."  "The Plantation" has all the control and they are letting it be known. Show me just one black NFL owner and I'll be quiet, until then it is what it is.  🎤 dropped ✌️
Shedeur Sanders Going Undrafted - I'm NOT surprised at all..
These talking heads crack me up… sanders is NOT that good.  Sheesh. 32 teams are not conspiring.  He is ant that good period
Sorry, Rich. You don’t get to blame the teams for not inviting the clubhouse cancer. The clubhouse cancer is not controllable. Jimmy’s right, the back up qb can’t be the one getting attention. CAN NOT! So, be safe, just don’t invite the nightmare to the dinner party. Two words sums up every team’s fear - LaVar Ball
"Mike Tomlin would not allow Sanders to become a narrative" - Rich Eisen.  Okay.  Antonio Browns wasn't a narrative I guess.  And George Pickens.  And Dionte Johnson.  And Russel Wilson.  And the offense under Matt Canada.  And the list goes on.
They really actin like Sheduer a problem because he already famous, and his last name has transcended beyond just the NFL
Everyone acting as if peyton manning dropped to the third round, shedeur isn’t even athletic enough to be a running qb. Teams don’t want a qb that went 13-12, has a narcissistic attitude with a narcissistic dad and weak arm. It’s really not that shocking
He sucks, why is anybody shocked he didn't get drafted?
Mid talented nepo baby didn't get his way. Time to play the race card 😢
ARod drama at the beginning of the career instead of at the end in the middle of a ARod Drama Storm that is on going. Deon has to take the L on this for his son. Young, dumb, and full of some other things would have been fine except you've got Deon in a papoose too with this kid.
I see a bright future in the USFL, CFL, or ARENA League 😂
The Steelers should take him and still get Rodgers. Rodgers ego would be able to curve some of that
They better not make this about race! This has absolutely NOTHING to do with race and everything to do with a young man and his daddy thinking they’re bigger than the game itself , and GMs seeing red flags everywhere surrounding this young man and deciding they’d like to pass on it. Perfectly understandable. Somebody will take him in a later round and let’s see it’s handled. Deon and Shedeur both claim to be me of God, let’s see if they handle this situation with grace and dignity and behave like heirs of our Lord Jesus Christ, or if they let the devil take over. 🙏
I’ve never really been a fan, but I feel bad for him seeing the victory lap people are taking enjoying this slide. In a roundabout way, he reminds me of Russell Wilson, there’s just that extra noise that comes with him, and that noise isn’t what you want for what is now a backup. Teams seem to be setting a foundation for a 2026 QB instead.   Steelers make the most sense still, they’ll be picking around the same spot again next year and Rodgers is probably one and done. Jets are probably getting curious. I think the Jags should be taking a real look now. Feels like they paid Trevor because it was next, not because he earned it. At this point there’s nothing to lose, bring in Shedeur and make Trevor hold him off.
The league is humbling the Sanders family, and they will learn from this. Shedeur should have been drafted by now, and someone may get huge value. Patrick Mahomes was drafted as a backup. Shedeur can benefit as the number 2, just like Mahomes. So many things can be true at the same time.
The slave owners trying to tell him we don't care how good you are.   NFL been racist and there pissed because he don't have a agent
These guys were about to cry last night. ESPN really wants to talk about Deion's kid so badly, but the teams keep passing on him. You know once he gets drafted they're going to ignore the next 20 picks and talk about him for 45 minutes.
Guys under sexual assault charges have been drafted. I’m not a fan of Shadeur but the character assassination has been crazy.
Welcome to the Sanders show. 😢😅
Surprised their con didn’t work this time. 😂
Joel is a true clown
THE REASON HE WASN"T DRAFTED IN THE FIRST ROUND IS CLEAR    HE"S NOT THAT GOOD  PERIOD   SO EVERYONE GET OVER IT  HE"S SOMEONE"S SON WHO WAS  A HALL OF FAMER  THAT DOESN"T MAKE THE SON ONE
Exactly tight , Tebow couldn't be a backup because of the circus that followed
This is a bad look for the NFL. This isn't about color. This isn't about talent. This is about the NFL owners telling the world who is in charge.  They don't want any more John Elways, Eli Manning.   This is the 1%, the owners, saying we are in charge. Not you. If you don't play by our rules, their will be consequences.
Might need to treat the NFL like Target.
This is the problem they want black men to be humble. If shedeuer was poor this would be different. He comes from money and is going to be fine.  The league did this to warren moon and he went on to win seven grey cups and is now a hall of famer in canada and nfl
Why is this such a big topic of converstion. He's a grown man who has to deal with the results of his action. He will be picked no matter the placement , proving his worthy. Until then move on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13-12 at colorado, not humble= late draft pick at QB. You want a backup QB with a brand bigger than his game... pass. Feel bad, but Prime should have left his soon try and make it himself. Little Labrone going through the same in the NBA.
Because the spotlight Dion brought to Colorado when he started there when nobody was looking at them. He then says he won't let teams draft his guys. Bet
It's about his attitude & off the field baggage with this kid
Another Manzel DeMarcus Russell,  Ryan Leaf.
Hunter won a Heisman and Sheduer struggled in the bowl game and didn’t throw at on his pro day combine.
BEG?!?!??? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!!!!
This is the best thing for him. The lower he goes the better. Getting the media off his back will give him the best chance to succeed.
The media is so scared to talk down on sanders out of fear of his dad and that could also be the problem the whole draft has been about a guy not getting drafted the media hyped this kid up when the league was like ehh
The league is sending Deion Sanders a message. And the message is "let Shedeur cook", and Deion stay at home.
Nothing humble in that family,  no DJs in locker room. Legendary lol
Smh this dude just said beg wow.  This proves how a man of color is treated smh   I pray he continues to be himself
The NFL passed on Tom Brady 5 times. We see how that turned out.
Maybe the wnba will draft him
What do you know? Sanders father would be his handicap.  Lol!
It’s extraordinarily hypocritical for anyone to be bashing these teams for spending their money on any athlete they choose.
kid  needs to learn no team is going to let him run  the show ................
It's a job interview.....
Every team in the league colluded to blackball Colin Kaepernick. It's entirely possible the League has made it personal with the Sanders name
Rich… if you are a generational talent teams will put up with more.  Sanders is NOT a generational talent
"Nfl is racist and wont draft him bc he is black" 😂
Anyone claiming the nfl is conspiring against Sanders is a complete moron! To think all 32 owners got on the phone and said don’t draft Deion’s kid until we say go is asssinine.. nfl is about winning and results.. if they felt he   was a difference maker and would make them better, win and sell tickets he be drafted alreasdy
If his name was Sam Jones would there be so much talk about him
ahhhh... they teaching him a lesson "Humble Pie" --they want him to apologize and get on them knees...Ive never seen this before...this is definitely personal.
Love Rich man. Let's stop the bs
yeah it does seem like the league is straight up black balling him at this point. jalen carter was picked first round, all these players with criminal pasts have been picked its kind of weird
How about the kid is not very GOOD, Lets be Honest!!!
Laugh thats the overpaid misfit league for you and people think because daddy did it, you can too, yawn!
Shedeur Sanders needs to join Toastmasters.
Talent no worth the Circus
Rich needs to be more professional on this topic
Coaches are scared Deion will take their job. It’s super obvious
I need friends like Rich... regardless of what the panel tried to explain to Rich, he was not having it because Deion is a homie and they come first over most
Think about it? Your not only drafting Sanders son. You will be also drafting his father.  And I don't think any team wants all that drama.  Media does!!!
13-12, 0-1 in bowl record, and 1-8 vs. top 25 teams. CU retired his number for that kind of record??? How will he do in the NFL against top defense and top offenses?
I feel like this is the nfl collectively looking at players like Leveon Bell Antonio Brown and Aaron Rodger’s and said no more divas.
Denver should draft him do dad can Coach on Sunday
Quiet and humble.......uhm ok
He's not that good and comes with baggage and pressure. Any team that takes him is going to be pressured to hire his dad as coach. He's not worth it and it's hilarious to me that all of the sports media people are puzzled about this outcome
The league isn’t afraid. They’re tryna make an example out of Shadeur. For what? Who knows. He’s about to have an even bigger fire lit under him now though
The hypocrisy is real
"Quarterback is different"? May I introduce you to Deshaun Watson? What a dumb statement. What NFL, is going to draft for a need at QB, has a coaching staff so safe that they can draft Sanders in the first 2 rounds without worrying about the owners and fans clamoring for Shedeur's dad to replace them?
Actually, Rich, he was Twitch streaming when he got pranked by a fake phone call.
It's about Deion, not his son. Very simple. Daddy messed up. His son isn't good enough to put up with what Deion would do to the franchise.
Its definitely wild. I never thought he was a first rounder but he in top five of the college qbs so idk but teams don’t like a qb especially out of college that promotes his “brand” other things so that obviously is playing a role but he never took snap under center. He threw a lot of balls up and had great athletes go get it. So idk kind of a wild story but not shocking, so shilo definitely not getting drafted?
Just think… Colorado retired sanders number😂😂 It’s clear the NFL doesn’t think that sanders juice is worth the squeeze.
It was the arrogant and disrespectful,  mouth of both him and his father , and his refusal to participate in the NFL combine, he had to prove, he was worth drafting Day 1 or Day 2 he did not do that, honestly, if all fails , the Dallas Cowboys will get him and his brother in the 7th round
EACH team seeks their own best interests...  Its not that the teams are blackballing him ... They are seeking their own best interests.. They are not against him..
At this point even if he goes on to start and then fizzle out, it will be everyone's fault but his
There have been literally who were accused of MURDER, Assault, (All Kinds), etc...  its definitely a coordinated effort against this young man.
When the Mannings do it. OK fine. But let Deion try the same thing....
Look what happened to Tim Tebow as a third string at the Pats. Created a media circus
11:20 we’re trying to explain something we don’t have answers too 😂😂😂 he’s blackballed and the pale ones on the screen want to keep it that way and rich and the homie are there looking at them like they’re dumb he should’ve been picked long time ago. Top 20 on his board but doesn’t have the talent stfu
Maybe Deion can taste some humble pie for once in his life.. sorry not sorry
Sanders too much drama and too Much daddy meddling
Poor Rich...got owned
I Love watching Rich , he always keeps it real and truthful . Today he's speaking facts .
I think part of the reason why nobody’s taking him is the fact that he’s been handed the starting quarterback position for everywhere he’s gone because his dad is Deion Sanders. Think about it. He’s never had to fight for the starting quarterback position because his dad was the head coach.
Thank you rich !!!
Rich can’t see past his own personal relationship
Rich Eisen fellating Shedeur Sanders is cringe. Remove the last name and the relentless hype and you are left with an undersized QB with average arm strength who holds the ball too long and doesn't move well in the pocket in other words a mid to late round pick
Nobody's saw him as an instant starter, and not one idiot would believe he'd be a good teammate as a backup. Best to let this nugget boy get humbled and have to sign as a UFA.
He must of pissed someone off in the NFL with power.
Yep all 32 owners hate the kid Get real
Deon trying to be like Lavar Ball and say “there’s teams we will not play for!!!” Yes the Mannings and Elways did that, but there’s a difference between being a generational talent slam dunk #1 pick and being a guy “he should go first round….”
and sugars supporters are already throwing the race card. Look at the chaus without him even on a team yet. Can you imagine if sugar is a back up and the first pass the starter misses Deion would be on TV demanding that sugar starts
Once again BS trying to come up with excuses and justify shelving a young man for no reason besides what mostly everyone seems to want to avoid
Lots of "experts" mad that their predictions arent coming true, nothing more. Desk jockeys with nothing to lose telling GMs they missed out is funny
Talent over EVERYTHING. The NFL has spoken…period!
Shedeur refused to participate at the combine.  He declined numerous requests by NFL teams to workout for them. His Dad said there are some teams he would simply refuse to play for. And here we have this panel of experts who don't understand why he hasn't been drafted yet. 🙄
I said it with Nix being the best in his class and I’m going to say the same about Dart!
Teams started choosing backup QBs in the 2nd round
So much of this has been media created. Not talent created. The MEDIA is full of friends of Deion...or rather, people who know that Deion "keeps receipts" so they're going to constantly be patting him on the back. Plus, media is driven by ratings, and Deion and his controversies bring ratings, and thus, money to media types. I think Shadeur is an average quarterback. I think Deion is an average coach. They're both excellent at driving ratings. But the NFL is a whole different game. Antics don't translate to success in the NFL. Only wins do. And again, I'm sorry, but Shadeur is not a proven entity in the QB world; he was 50% at Colorado in wins. He has notable problems. But the media has created so much hype that they can't see clearly. You know who sees clearly? Teams that are going to invest 100's of millions of dollars into players. Putting Shadeur even in the top 20 of draft picks was largely driven by the media hype, and the danger of pissing Deion off in the media landscape. Notice, EVERY media type that slightly criticizes Shadeur HAS TO FOLLOW THAT STATEMENT UP WITH "but I love Deion, I consider him a friend." They all treat Deion with fear of pissing him off. And Eisen is right at the top of that list. So many people on here crying that Gabriel was picked before Sanders...really? Gabriel has proven himself at elite levels over his collge career. Different systems. He faced a much harder schedule, and still came away with a 13-1 record in 2024, and 9-0 in the Big Ten. His QBR was third in the nation. To talk about Gabriel as though he shouldn't have been picked where he was, in the third round, is delusional.
The league is black balling Sanders...BS. All of these GMs and coaches have their jobs on the line. No way ALL of them collude to "send the Sanders family a lesson". They have games to win because if they don't they lose their jobs. You think Dabol cares about narratives this season? He's hoping he doesn't lose his job.  They might think his talent is good, but it isn't good enough to overcome his personality. They want to control him? Yes, absolutely. It doesn't matter how talented you are if they don't trust you. All that talent can be turned against the team that drafts him. That's what they are worried about. Maybe, if he were Caleb good someone would take a shot on him, but even then not so sure.
This is a Deion and Shadeur problem not an NFL team problem. At the beginning of this process, Deion and Shadeur literally were telling certain teams they wouldn't play for them. Why Eisen thinks teams should overlook that kind of attitude is beyond me. Rich is smarter than that. He's way too close to this situation to see it clearly.
Arrogant attitude 💯
Man I can tell a lot of political statements being said in these here comments without saying it. Now Eisen is lame and wrong because he has empathy for the kid? GTFO here with the he doesn't deserve it. The Louisville QB is trash and to be drafted before is crazy! They all have valid points and we have no idea what went on in these meetings but from what I seen he's a NFL QB if some of these others are smh
This is pathetic, they are so consumed with this Sanders stuff, they don't even give much commentary for the drafted players
Johnny Manzel 1st rounder, Jamarcus Russell 1st rounder so on and so forth.   This is insanity
Simple. The talent doesn’t match the headache and personality
Man that kid, his dad have only talked about God, positivity and confidence. How that's equaling he needs self reflection is wild to me. Yall want a QB with attitude but now he doesn't gel because of his attitude. Mayfield and Manziel both had reports of attitude issues. Manziel was skippin practice and camps to throw parties and got drafted first round lol. Arch  Manning told teams my son isn't playing for you, now Deion Sanders and his son is "unprofessional".
Never heard rich like this he is genuinely upset.
I love Rich and his content, but man is showing his Deion bias hard here. Still going to follow, not unforgivable but very on the nose
"This doesn't need to play out on Social media"  " This has to be quiet and humbled " 🤡🤡🤡🤬🤬🤬🤮🤮🤮
If Shedeur was a WR he goes in the first round
The love they have for painting a crazy narrative of an outright and openly confident black man is the funniest thing the league does. yt qbs can be cocky and loud as anyone on Earth but this dude is just too much of a distraction 😭
So if the steelers are worried about having a distraction in the locker room, then they are a hypocrite because your waiting for the #1 distraction to tell you if he wants to play or not. He says no then your stuck with Mason Rudolph. This is just a sad situation. I feel all the owners had a meeting about this and all agreed to not take him. Not even Jerry Jones picked him up smh.
The fact is, his reads are terrible and takes too many sacks because of it. That will not translate well to the NFL.
😂😂😂 these white boys wont win, Black proud Strong!!! You hate but you wont stop his talent,. You wont have a choice but congradulate. ❤
Bruh not everything is racism !!! Stop trying to always be victims !!! They don’t like his attitude and that’s fair, plus he’s not that good !!
It's the Kapernick effect.  Teams (collectively or not, right or wrong) have said "we don't want to deal with this drama."   They have done the talent vs drama math and it's not in Shadeur's favor.
Nobody wants to touch his circus... Who would?
Dude is saying he should call teams and beg for a team to pick him up.  BS
I call BS…… baker mayfield? Johnny manzel? Who has more attitude than them?
I’m sure there are 32 teams that would love to have Sanders as a QB2 starting now. The problem is Sanders won’t accept being a QB2.
The dude, in the maroon jacket talks nonsense... hating on Shedeur like they did on Lamar... talent should come first, not social media hate...
Travis is a generational talent. I think he has the potential of a HOF career. Shadeur is a backup level QB at best. It has nothing to do with who his family is or his off field life.
I thought Rich was gonna cry! 😭 Sanders did this to himself. Teams just want to win, so they’d draft him if they wanted him to be the face of their franchise.
Glad to see the guy Trump wants to get taken slides even further. Continuing Trump's legacy of Ls in football. I really think him sliding really boils down to coaches fear of managing him with Dieon constantly being a threat to undermine them and try to take their jobs. He just isn't that much better than the other QBs to be worth all that hassle.
Totally agree with Rich
He literally said a month ago “If you don’t want to change your culture, don’t pick me.” So teams listened. Deion famously walked out of the Giants interview because he knew his talent was enough to not have to worry. His son is good, not great. Certainly not great enough to carry that same attitude his father had in the pre draft process.
The league is clearly sending a message. It’s simple. You are not bigger than the organization.
All Deon’s friend.  Give us better n truthful reporte.  They suck
It's all about nfl politics.which alow players like Terrell Davis. And Tom Brady to go in the six round. They used dione sanders name to make billions. He don't need to beg these plantation masters. Prime time is bigger than all of them
I literally couldn’t care less. He’ll get drafted someplace and that’s that.
So fun and cathartic to watch
I can't quite understand why people keep saying "32 teams passed him by".. .In reality only maybe 6 teams needed a QB and there was only 1 QB in the draft that should have been picked before him.  They need to stop letting media print negative (pre draft) reports about athletes where a source is not willing to go on the record. If you are willing to speak something that could be detrimental to someone's career, be named... Period...
Can you spell C-O-L-L-U-S-I-O-N?
Take the kid gloves off. Its embarrassing for you and the kid youre talking about.
I won’t be mad if dolphins pick him up in the third, great backup make sit and learn more like Jordan love, and give more time fix the line and maybe tua leave idk
Rich has to take a step back from this whole thing. He's been touchy on everything Sanders for a long time.
Shedeur is overrated and will be a bust in the NFL
Rich don't be a hypocrite. If you wanna talk red flags start with your beloved Michigan Wolverines
Dak was picked 4 th round and he has done very well but a totally different attitude
Out spoken Father with a bigger then life platform???
It’s crazy that these guys are telling this man to grovel
The NFL is doing the Shedeur to Shedeur
I don't have a strong opinion about Shedeur one way or another, but I do know if he becomes a star a lot of NFL teams are gonna have some real egg on their faces for dismissing him these first 3 draft rounds.
This is how you stand up for a friend!!
Having Sanders on your team is like having hard knocks on crack in your locker room with no filters or rights to decide what gets aired. Fcuk that. Teams don’t need him
Bad look for the NFL honestly.  This is collusion among ownership.  They don’t want Deon Sanders in their building. So they don’t draft his son regardless of his talent level.  He gave bad interviews, he’s too cocky, he pats the ball 😂 no man, it’s way more than that 100% Teams like the Browns, Colts, Steelers, Rams, & Saints had no reason to pass on him. They hurt their franchise.
Sanders should go back to college and get his degree.   Being a possible day 3 pick,  there's no guarantee that he'll make the team that picks him in the first place.
For a person that spends a significant amount of time around draft prospects and their process overall, Rich is acting pretty ignorant here. It’s kinda hard to watch because it seems fake
Maroon jackets telling it. He knows the league wants Shadeur humble. Thats crazy. He is telling what they're saying. The glamour isnt him but his Dad. I know its his Dad because he mentioned their realiry show...That's crazy 😮😮😮
They really tryna break shorty spirit.. they jus told him to call and beg to get picked
The Eagles will pick him up in the 5th if nobody else does first. One more reason for the league to hate us. We'll let him play in the preseason and blowouts then flip him for a 3rd to some desperate franchise.
Sorry but hes not that good quite glazing this dude he's only being talked about because of his dad not him
Most teams are leery of the drama he will bring...especially to the locker room....no cohesiveness in the locker room spells doom for any team....and Dion being part of the package doesn't help😮
The reason Shedeur goes undrafted... fill in the blank... Love seein' those "expert" mocks blown up!  And Rich, stop making poor excuses for Sanders. Teams wanna solutions, not problems.
Wasn't just interviewed badly it was thinking he's above it all before ever taking a snap, skipping pro days and trying to manipulate where your getting drafted .  Shadeur is close to tom Brady so he should know it don't matter where you get drafted just make it there and take advantage of your chance when you get it.
Eisen talking of Tomlins' locker room under control is FREAKING hilarious
simply embarrassing😢 once you get in work even harder kid, your time coming🌟
Cmon Rich, this happened to Sanders because of his loud father just as the Ball brothers went through what they went through because of Lavar. And I actually like Deion. But the brashness is annoying.
I can't wait for Sanders to have a long and successful career, and for the others to be out of the league in three years.
The ultimate QB?  Talented with no drama.  Sanders = talent, sure, but also ego, self-aggrandizement, and drama.  You'd be drafting an "event" for your back-up.  An event who has a big-mouthed father.  6 games in, when the starter struggles, can Deon keep his trap shut? NOT A CHANCE.  Ain't nobody got time for that. A big slice of humble pie is in order.  Deon retired his son's jersey, changing the rules for the honor to suit his son. This isn't racial, well not totally, it's about lack of humility.
He doesn't have to beg anyone!!!
Joel just cooked Rich Eisen🔥- he’s 1000% right. Rich used Bill Belichick as someone who would control things forgetting anyone he had who created noise was released (Cam Newton, Antonio Brown, etc…) I think SS might be a good QB, but there’s no doubt Prime tailored what Colorado did to highlight his son. Plus the kid is arrogant as hell
Deion and Shadeur are me-first people in a team-first game. Too many problems and the talent level just isn't worth it. Your third-string, or developmental, QB has to be the most humble person in the world. And Shadeur ain't that. So, if Shadeur doesn't have Caleb Williams/Jayden Daniels level talent, which means he is going to be your starter from the get-go, and he does not, then there's not a good fit for him on an NFL team. He has a world-class starter ego and developmental back-up QB tools and that's a bad combo.
take your chains off young fella
C'mon, folks, we're not talking Bronny James here! Mediocrity can't comprehend greatness, but, instinctively knows to be jealous, envious of those who possess it. Folks couldn't, and still CAN'T, humiliate Deion, so, this is satisfying to a lot of them...sort of their passive-aggressive revenge on someone they couldn't force to conform. Not EVERYONE, mind you.  Read what I said.  But, enough folks who hide their hands, but, given opportunity, got a lot of hatred to vent, hate that NO ONE was EVER able to humble Deion, as a player OR coach, and, think that they're somehow going to stifle Shadeur being who he was raised to be. Ain't happening.  He IS a child of REAL greatness, not the generic variety.  We're not talking Bronny James here!
Maybe he is not as good as the bullshit media has said he is.
Good discussion. He's not a 1st round talent. At that point teams are drafting for a backup/developmental player. Teams are rightfully scared that if he's not starting he'll be a distraction.
who is this apologist in the purple jacket? Johnny Manziel, Ryan Leif, Baker Mayfiled had all kinds of attitude issues, but early first round. Archie Manning says where Ele won't play, early first round, even Ahston Jeanty compared himself to Saquon, that is great self confidence  but for Shedaur, it's all bad. Never mind he had a 70% completion rating, 80% when not under pressure, good decision making, durable. Collusion and buck breaking.
This is coaches and GMs protecting their jobs from Deion Sanders. Because once Shedeur is drafted and you don't win the next thing is Deion coming for your jobs.
The issues are as follows. 1. Great qb market next year. 2. Sanders not seen as elite talent. And yes he is better than a 4th rounder but 3. His interviews? Is he someone who expects to start is he someone who thinks he is much much better than he is? Can he handle  that teams see him as more a backup or project? Can his Dad handle that and not make it a public spectacle? Well Deion was already predraft limiting teams he would go to....
People are missing that none of the QBs in this class were truly 1st round talents to begin with.  Ward has a lot of things you like and can build on, so he makes sense going 1st.  Dart has the size and athleticism that you can at least understand it.  Deion and Shedeur tried to dictate like he was a lock top 5 talent, when he's more like a Round 2/Round 3 talent.  They also tried to flat out tell teams he wouldn't play for them.  That's all well and good, but there's only 32 starting QB jobs in the league.  You start ruling out some of your own accord and you're just making that list even smaller.  Now we're at the point where he's clearly not gonna start for any team this season, so teams have to consider if they want that attitude as their backup.  I'm saying this all to say his options were limited on teams that needed a QB BEFORE the draft process.
I don't understand Sanders fall. I live in Colorado. I watched him every week. He is extremely accurate. Extremely poised. He had a bad oline and zero running game. Granted he isn't very mobile. If a team can give him decent protection he will make these teams look stupid for passing on him.
Canada isn't that cold... give the Calvary a call.
You analysts are full of it, making excuses for not draft Shadeur.  That s crap what you are saying.  No one said that when the browns drafted a drunk in the first round.
Lavar Ball…LeBron James…. These teams are tired of over-involved parents. Who would want to deal with that?
Telling this kid to beg is crazy 😭😭
Rich is best friends with Deion Sanders. I get that this is hard for him, but it’s gotta be hard for him to even attempt to be objective here.
Im willing to bet a team did call the Sanders family to draft him and Deion turned them down because he wanted a more desirable team.
The media overhyped the kid licking his dad's boots.  This isn't the NBA and Deion aint LeBron.
Hi percentage of line of scrimmage throws.
How can a QB not attend the Combine, not throw on his school's pro day, and interview badly be expected to be drafted in the NFL? Sanders brought this on himself.
Remembered they did the same to aaron Rodgers
If Shedeur goes undrafted that’ll be the biggest joke of the draft! XD 😂🤣
Shedeur gonna learn to like humble pie
The backup QB thing is a salient point. Who wants to even spend a 6th on Shedeur and risk the media circus surrounding him? I guess we'll find out, or maybe he just goes undrafted!
Awful lot of schadenfreude in the comments for a 23 year old kid who did nothing worse than have a few bad job interviews, with an outspoken dad.
Shedeur gonna learn to like humble pie
It bothers me when I hear these sports announcers and reporters referring to a team or players "aggressiveness". Its called AGRESSION. How are these ppl so dumb.
It's crazy to me Joel Klatt is asking Shedeur to basically beg for a job privately. Pull up the draft tape on Hunter and ask yourself why didn't anyone give kudos to the coach who mentored him to the #2 selection taking him thru two colleges. When does that ever happen, I'm 54 yrs old never heard of that in my lifetime.
He won just over .500 of his games. He never won his conference. Never made a college playoff. Did not even sniff it. His stats are pedestrian. He has major flaws in his game. He is not that big and does run that well. He is average there. But he played in a bad conference and put up some numbers and is deons son.   So yall thought he was a first round pick? smh... LOL LOL LOL   Also, NO TEAM WANTS TO DEAL WITH HIS ARROGANCE AND OFF THE FIELD SOCIAL MEDIA CLOWN SHOW. NOBODY WANTS TO DEAL WITH DADDY DEON QUESTIONING THEIR ORGANIZATION PUBLICLY. NO TEAM WANTS ALL THE FLASH AND ALL THE INSECURITY THAT DADDY DEON HAS INSTILLED IN HIS KID.
This is the league and the owners
It’s probably a humbling experience
Shedeur:  -Has the Sanders last name (which comes with a lot of media attention/scrutiny) -Didn’t throw at the combine. -Apparently bombed pre-draft interviews coming off as entitled as opposed to confident. -Apparently said he wasn’t coming in to change a team’s culture, but have said culture change for HIM. - Tape/intangibles are good but not great.  Teams project him as a backup and with not many teams needing QBs, it’s both surprising he wasn’t drafted but also not a surprise.  The talent/potential is there (enough to where he should’ve maybe been drafted by round 3). However can’t fault teams for evaluating him as they chose to do so & not reaching for him (when compared to lesser talent that himself that doesn’t have media circuses surrounding them).  Seems like he didn’t sell himself well. Best to come in now (when/if he gets drafted), keep his head down, grind and stay humble.  He’ll use this a fuel for sure.
The talent opinion at this hour has lost all salt 🧂. Sorry bud 😂😂😂.  Too many examples out there of less talent filling ip the spots.
Owners ain't having that ish. Not EVEN JERRY😂
Lets be honest if he wasn't deon son he wouldn't have gotten this much attention 🤷🏽
telling him to beg is childish. grow up panelist #4
Can you imagine how many people of color would give to a black league, just by what is taking place now. Can you imagine how many players would be interested in it,  it's Shedeur now, maybe them next time!
Get off your high horse about this entitled she door.  You fed this narcissist and now he looks shocked no one wants him narcissistic 101 and no one wants one     I do not agree with you.  You are 100% wrong.  You don’t want to upset Deon    Rich is a Deon friend you can’t get the truth from that idiot.  Jesus Christ Rich tell the truth.
This is all about (lack of) character.  Criticizing O-line and team mates...poor sportsmanship...apparently took a call from his dad in the middle of a pre-draft visit demonstrates a total lack of focus and respect...
Its the combination of attitude, attention, and overestimating his own talent. First with his talent, he's not a starter at the nfl level. Hes slow through his decision making process, he waits for his receivers to get open rather than throwing them open, his arm is below average, and he relied on receivers doing a great job of catching under thrown 50/50 balls. Then he has an entitled attitude and a media behind him that as soon as the starting QB struggles he'll say I should be starting and if I dont the coach or GM should be fired and you make yourselves too toxic to touch.
Y'all just don't wanna be the one to say, it's because DION thinks he's gonna run the Show where ever his kids go. There, I said it.
Lmao so many haters in these comments. Hate to see a confident black man
The way it's going, Lebron will be getting drafted before Shedeur.
Shedeur’s problem is he isn’t willing to go and work for it, at least that’s not what he advertises. He advertises himself saying that he already did the work for it and he’s the best QB to walk the earth. He’s got Johnny Manziel energy (minus the partying), and nobody wants that.
This is racism bottom line. You gotta black family not kissing the white mans butt trying to join the club and they scared of that.
He is obviously not a player with the skill and character to attract an NFL team.....
You can't dictate to teams. He hasn't earned anything yet. Nobody is above the team or organization.
Klatt is an elite analyst, one of the absolute best. but dude had Sanders as #1 QB, literally just cuz the Colorado connection 💀
Imagine Deion crying on socials every weekend after his sons nfl games…nobody wants that nobody needs that that simple..I’m a jet fan we never had a good qb I don’t want him or his circus show daddy 😂 the franchise is enough of a joke we good
Maybe Sanders taking the Jonny Menzel approach was the wrong one to take . 6 billion dollar franchises aren’t in the business of losing money. Brock Purdy was Humble and it didn’t matter when he got drafted. He showed up to work, proved his worth took the starting job and never looked back. You think he cried when he got drafted last? Or did just stay humble?
I think the NFL is not necessarily acting in collusion, but certain players have an aura of being a distraction.  I think Dad is a big part of that.  Dad will   always be putting his two cents in and getting involved in any team that drafts his son.  Who needs that?
LISTEN- We all know in the Business world personally  has nothing to do with Business so Owners are making this personal -I study psychology so the owners are clearly making a Statement!( Browns drafted a QB No. 1 caught on tape drunk and running from police.)
Maybe, just maybe he's a prima Donna and the baggage he brings just isn't worth it. He's going to end up a huge bust...
Shedeur is not talented enough to come off the way he has to NFL coaches and executives. Sorry! Sanders is a weak quarterback in a weak quarterback draft class and he’s behaving like he’s going to be some franchises’ savior. Add Daddy to the mix and I don’t blame any team for passing on this nepo-baby, entitled punk.
Sanders is not as good as people think.  13-12 in two years at Colorado.  Slow delivery, not a playmaker with his feet, needs a stellar O line to be productive and 42 sacks last year says it all.  Sanders was a 3 rd round talent at best, that comes with a circus of distractions with him to the locker room.  Not worth the trouble for a back up QB.
All these dudes up there lying about what's going on with Shedeur not being picked LMAOOO... talking about "we have no idea why this happening" "we don't have the answers" 😂😂aren't these the dudes that claim to have intel & relationships with GMs, team scouts, and other Front Office folks....... OK lol
Rolling with Rich on this one 😤😤.
LEAUGE OWNERS, GOOD OL BOYS, are NOT, going to let a circus in, without HUMBLING these hi profile, show off, side show welcome new jacks. I love the sanders period. But ain't nothing changed in ownership.
They don’t like a confident black man
Maybe loading up on cupcakes and losing every meaningful game, padding stars against bad teams has caught up to the Sanders family. He simply isn’t top three round talent. Cry to Tom Brady and Brock Purdue about it
Legendary fail! Try again junior...
This really never surprised me. I just don't think they wanted to deal with his dad and all the drama. He's really arrogant, not confident but arrogant and I don't think it helped when Dion said he might intervene privately with teams if he thought Shedeur was being drafted by the "wrong" team.
Anyone considered that maybe  he just isn't good enough for the NFL??
Eisen not impartial. Dieon ruined his son.
Why would he get on the phone and and beg they already know he going to come and work
They are using Shedeur Sanders to keep us tuned in to watch the draft! Nobody watches the draft on the second and third day. Check out the ratings! Plus his Dad got some real haters!! Sad what they're doing to this man and this hurts Coach Sanders recruiting. 🤬 I can't believe these guys want him to beg!🤬
Rich crashing out hard
“This league never turns down talent.” 😂 ummm… Colin Kaepernick?
Rich is acting bias can’t do that my bald friend
He's a hype show
Geezus Rich, you are proving your own point here that Sanders is a huge distraction.  He just hijacked this whole segment. But let's take a brief moment to discuss the other kids.......smh
You have the answer, you just don’t want to believe it
That man told him to BEG! Never would a YT man have to do that! Look at Jonny Manzel or ELI manning...get out of here with that BS! Go eat some humble pie...crazy work.  They have ever excuse in the book. Self reflection? Him and Cam did the same things!
This could end up being the best thing that could have happened to Shadeur’s NFL career. He’ll be the most balanced player in the league—chips on both shoulders.
Revenge will come in the contract
The advise to grovel was a serious fumble 😂. Guy is a mini star ⭐️, it happens. Just hoping he gets in, that’s it. Then we see him ball 🏈 .
There’s no Justification for not taking SS in the first or second round???
“The browns drafted a QB #1 that ran away from the cops but won’t draft Shedeur in the 3rd round” as though Baker Mayfield in 2018 wasn’t 1000x better at football than Shedeur will ever be. Not to mention Baker took the draft process seriously, didnt say no to playing for teams, his dad wasnt threatening to do that too, he addressed off the field issues more than just calling those pointing them out haters, and was 1000x more of a locker room leader than Shedeur is
All I know is last week, an anonymous source said that Shedeur Sanders was the worst interview that he had ever done and now he's going undrafted. I don't think it has to be any more than that. I can only imagine how disrespectful he probably was.
The Bills need a back up.......but not THIS badly.  Sanders is a media magnet...not good
The Chiefs are picking last.
I don't really think this is all that deep. It's simply the NFL Owners reminded everyone who works for who.
The guy in the red suit is one of them good old boys
Bottom line…🎶This is America, got myself trippin now🎶 In other words, we need to humble this black man who thinks too highly of himself🤔
I find it funny that people think that someone, Godell? some other shadowy figure? Can get 32 billionaires that just want their teams to make money, and 32 GM's trying to protect their jobs by winning, and QB needy coaches that could get fired this year for not having a QB, all on the same page to black ball a kid cause, what? His family is cocky and can run a narrative? There's just no motivation there for that kind of conspiracy. If they got together and said "send a message and don't draft the kid" its literally a crime. the simplest explanation is usually the right one.   The evaluators worth a darn, like PFF, had him as a second round grade, who his dad is got him hyped up as something that he's not. He's a project and more of a backup that could be a starter in the right system... and yet he's coming in dictating to teams what he'll do or not do. it's been reported that he's telling coaches how he needs to be used. At a certain point he comes with the media circus because he's outspoken and a celebrity in his own mind. who wants that as a project QB? not to mention he comes with a dad that has aspirations of being an NFL coach who is a heavy handed in the media guy. there's all kinds of baggage here for a guy that doesn't project as a first round year 1 starter.   Like they said, it's a talent over everything league. The Mannings and Elway pulled off similar things because at the end of the day they had the talent level that gave teams reason to deal with it.
a Qb that acts like a pre-madonna i think is a turn off in the NFL  teams want the QB to be the most mature guy in the room
Eisen is funny.  Whining like a little baby.  Truth is Deion was a handful when he played.  Deion had come out early with teams his son would not play for and later walked it back.  His son interviewed poorly and from what has been said arrogant and self entitled.  So if you are a team looking to draft a qb do you want Deion Sanders questioning every move and a son who doesn’t want to listen.  In 2 years do you want to deal with being asked for a trade?  5 years do want to deal with a hold out looking for a ridulous deal?  All that seems to be valid reasons why teams would be concerned…
Why are you trying to explain it though? He obviously does not have the requisite skill required to be an NFL QB. He's not owed anything. We live in a free country and he's free to go get a damn job like the rest of us. Welcome to life.
NO Team Wants the Premo Attitude.
People forget, these meetings are essentially job interviews. You don't call the shots, neither does your dad. I hate what's happening, but if you know the way these owners operate, they don't tolerate being told "this is how its gonna be". Still rooting for him, but I said from the beginning that Deion was gonna be a problem. Shedeur will be fine. Once he's on the field, he'll be fine.
This is rich eisen at his worst.
So, let me get this straight. These guys are saying Sanders needs to pick up the phone and beg these losers to let him play in their league?
If you draft Shadeur, you're drafting Deion and that doesn't seem to appetizing
A Black QB better be :  1. Humble     2. Act Clueless to his Worth ( Lamar Jackson’s Contract )  3. Shut up and Play Football ( Involving Social Issues ) 4. Show no Emotions  5. Never Highlight the Obvious  6. Never let Your “Dad” give U career advice ( Like Archie Manning )  7. Beg , when all else fails If U want a Job in “Our” League…. If U are a Pale QB just show up and be able to throw a Forward Pass and bonuses would be :  1. Having Confidence Oozing out Your Muscles  2. Always expect to be Overpaid( Curt Cousins Contract )  3. Outspoken Leader ( Aaron Rodgers ) 4.Passionate about Winning ( Brady ) 5. Express Team issues “Openly”( Joe Burrow )  6. Comes from Good NFL Family Pedigree Stock due to his Father Once  being a Pivotal Decision maker ( Marinovich , Manning ) 7. All 32 Teams would be on the Hot Seat with QB needs or not explaining why They passed up on Can’t Miss Talented Prospect , a Proven Winner at all levels so far , a Player that can Galvanize Your Franchise or at least a Player that can fill the seats with Fans  This Player is not a Distraction this Player comes with expectations of “Winning” which will change the Culture and bring the Media Coverage to be able to reach more Fans  Bottom Line: The NFL is a Plantation League where the hidden rules and requirements are ironically equivalent to a game of Tackle Football between 2 Neighboring Plantations with Enormous Money at Stake… The Management need the Players but the Management decides who will have an Opportunity to Play and who doesn’t… Bottom Line!!!!..  Don’t like it , then buy a Channel to be Televised create a Minor League get some Structure and Organization and the go from there!!!.. Competition is Necessary when U want Change and Respect 💯💪🏽🎬💩
I bet anything he told multiple teams he wouldn't play for them. In his "legendary" draft room he only had 20 hats. So 12 other teams were told ge won't play for them
I like shedure he's def better than a 4th rd prospect even with the baggage
What these teams are doing is highly personal and egregious. It makes the league look petty and vindictive. It's disgusting
Teams  don't want to deal with Shedeur Sanders' ego, father,  and media circus.  He isn't a good enough player to deal with all that.  Rich brought up retiring Sheduer's number.  Well, teams probably don't want a kid who didn't say "No pa, I'm not good enough to retire my number.  Travis might deserve it, but I don't. We didn't win nothing." (I actually think Travis did earn it, but not because of what the team did, but because Travis was perhaps the best 2 way player in decades)
Does shaddeur speak Canadian? They’ve got a league up there!
Rich get out from under Deions desk
Deion is the problem…teams don’t want his drama…i wouldn’t either
Maybe Sanders is a better fit for the UFL? Go there, play immediately, and show everybody was wrong about you.
Boo hoo. Maybe one SHOULD shake hands after games. Perhaps LEGENDARY is better than 4-8? And? NO ONE WANTS THE CIRCUS THAT COMES WITH HIM.  I LOVE it… big mouths got shut down, didn’t they?
If this doesn’t tell you how Main Stream Media is a joke….. Lies Lies Lies coming out of all their mouths.
Shedeur do not BEG! STAY IN YOUR TRUTH! You will get that opportunity and when you do, PUNISH EVERYONE who didn’t give you an opportunity! GOD got your back!
Howard is still best QB left
You see how they posted his Thank you God post .. they’re trying to humiliate and persecute him for being a believer of the most high …Timothy 3:12   This is nothing but spiritual warfare . This was never about talent when it comes to shaduer
Maybe......     just maybe.....     he sucks.
Nobody wanted to Draft Deion in 2025.
The Sanders family and those who are scratching their heads in wonder need to better understand the difference between the words "Confidence" & "Conceit"....
No one wants obvious trouble on their team. Sanders has too big of a chip on his shoulder.  Plus, his obnoxious father would be part of the story. No thanks!
Brandon Weeden, Josh Rosen, Anthony Richardson, etc all worth a 1st but Sanders isn’t?  The NFL doesn’t like Black QBs with personality.
If you want to know why he wasn’t picked this segment is why. It’s 14 mins long and you spent 11 talking about the guy who didn’t get picked. HE IS A DISTRACTION. HE HAD TERRIBLE INTERVIEWS. THE PRODUCTION N THE FIELD WASNT GOOD ENOUGH TO OUTWEIGH THAT.
The genuine confusion and lack of consensus in this convo just says everything about this. What a situation
Whether Rich has a personal relationship with Dion or not is not the issue 👌🏾 The racism and hate of this black family in today's Trump climate have brought out people's true colors 👌🏾
Purdy and Brady went late
I think one reason we enjoy sports is because you get what you earn when you are on the field! It was great to have your pops coach and possibly show favorite! This is a challenge ok both sides I can see this! But he is a great talent and should’ve went round one!
Dak went in the 4th round and Shedeur has never looked as good as Dak did in college and Dak played in SEC. Shedeur is a poor man's Dak Prescott.
Sanders simply will come with a circus and no one wants to deal with it and PRIME TIME.  Shut up and play football 🏈
Don't think Shedeur is a Top 10 qb, but he should have gone in the first two rounds.  Personalities aside, he broke many records at Colorado and helped to revamp a 1-10 program.  He's a pocket passer who can read defenses.  Even with his father's meddling, I think he should have been swooped up by now.
NFL is a collusion business.
This is absolutely 💯 BS...to pick journeyman level Qbs over him...for being "too" confident...for him having a good father's help is now somehow a detriment...pedigree is supposed to be a benefit not a hindrance...
Sheduer is Confident and Cocky and teams don't always like that. If he was Super Talented they would take the chance.
Ridiculous people thinking  this is an NFL thing trying to “teach” Sanders family.   This needs a whole “collective” narrative , but the NFL isn’t colluding.  . Each team evaluated talent and each team knows Thier needs and if A player fills those needs they get selected.  Also ridiculous this is about Owners, GM’s or coaches Adair’s of cameras and social media.    Great point made, after the first round  qb’s are looked at as “backups”.   Lastly , this isn’t about “hate” or “gett’n Sanders etc.   If you have followed Colorado and the words used there over the last few season it was “people hate’n” etc.   go watch …
The NFL doesn't owe any player anything.
Humble?????? Ayee young these analysts are some haters. He don’t need to apologize for. Nothing
A little humility would do Sanders a world of good
Oh come on can we say his attitude? And the fact that his dad manages probably every aspect of his sons career…maybe if Deion owned an NFL team then his son would be set but every team team doesn’t want to draft a cocky player and his diva dad…it’s not hard to see fellas…I get you’ve gotta keep the drama alive and unanswered questions but it’s kinda apparent…
Rich Eisen carrying water for his buddy, Deion. Shadeur isn't good enough to overcome the red flags not only on himself but on his father. Nobody wants to deal with the crap that is going to come with drafting Shadeur. Not worth it.
Being hated by the nfl before you ever arrive is Legendary. Low key if you think about it Colorado didn’t get a fair whistle the coaches weren’t welcoming a new coach into the fold it even seemed like there were bounties put out on buff players an the refs allowed a it. They are going to make Prime come coach in the nfl if they keep this up tbh an maybe that’s it they want prime to come to the nfl an he doesn’t want to so they are doing this
For anyone who thinks this is not personal doesn’t know sports.  This is very personal and NFL doesn’t not like Deion  and is taking it out on his son. This is why I do.l not watch nfl but I stay watching ncaa football. These analyst all trying to lie about they don’t know why sanders is not taken when they know. Sanders should go to another pro football league be the face of it and draw talent to the other pro league
Rich always keep it real! That other guy doesn't know nothing. Sanders family knew this was coming
I love Rich….. but he seems VERY compromised here
No one went to his birthday
Milroe going over Sanders is crazy
0:55 what was that???
Deion Sanders sat on tv and told the world he wouldn't allow teams to draft his son. You get what you deserve.
Shadeur is a nepo baby with all the bad things that come with a nepo baby. Why would anyone want that on their team
1st- Shedeur should absolutely not be calling GMs begging for them to select him/give him a chance. I may not care for his style of play, but he's absolutely better than some of those who were selected ahead of him. From an outside perspective...that says all we need to know. Keep head up Shedeur and prove them wrong if given a chance.
Shedeur Sanders is Not a Natural QB! Sorry rich but he should have been a WR/CB!
These guys other than rich disgust me.
Cleveland drafted Johnny manzel with all his red flags but couldn't be bothered to draft shedeur because of how he came across in the interview. So he has a maturity problem. Johnny had alcohol problems
No one wants the mess. All the "Realty TV" nonsense and all that is not worth the risk for a team to take him. NFL teammates won't want that. Its also about how teammates will react to that stuff and it would disrupt a team big time of professionals. Talent is not everything. If he was like Insanely good he'd be picked. But he is NOT insanely good. He is just Deion's son and THEN second he is good...... but not GREAT. If he was like great and insanely good he'd be picked. But he is NOT that good.  No one wants that B S. He had his own draft party at his house because he "Wanted the Bag" from the private party instead of being at the draft. That sums it up. They were telling people that they will get the bag over the NFL team that picks him. He is not worth the risk and the biggest thing is that HE IS NOT THAT GOOD to take in the round 1 or he would have been taken. TRUTH. If he was GREAT teams would be like....we ON IT!!!!!!!!!!
It just sounds like the media hyped up an unlikeable, mediocre QB and are embarrassed that they got it wrong
Thank you Rich and Charles The insistence he should call and be humble is fishy Rich knows they know something 11:24
I don't buy for a second this BS.  There is a huge difference between what the media thinks and what coaches and teams think.  I remember a running back from the University of Washington that the media picked to go in the first round who went undrafted.  Nobody had a personal problem with him.  If Sanders has what it takes, teams would draft him in a second.  But let's not pretend this is a perfect science.  If it was, Russell Wilson wouldn't hav3 fell to the third round or Tom Brady to the 6th.
It's really, really simple; teams don't want all that DRAMA!! Shedeur has the Talent to ball in the NFL but there's just too much SMOKE created by his dad and himself and the headache that comes with that is not worth it. If he can humble himself and do a stint in the CFL, that would be good for him.
*CLEARLY, THEY SEES THE TRUTH  IT'S THE ATTITUDE AND DRAMA THAT WILL COME WITH THE HOLDING THE BALL TOO LONG & LOW HEIGHT AND 40-TIMES*
It is personal let’s cut the bull. We know it’s personal.
Media pushing for a kid to get drafted just because of who his dad is. Kid is a 6th rounder.  At best.
There is a lot to this story the fact that this is the biggest story of the draft maybe the very reason most teams have passed on him!
Start you a black league. Reach out to investors who are aware of what's happening, to invest. Change history! Sometimes things happen for Change.
It is personal let’s cut the bull. We know it’s personal.
He shouldn't have to beg! This is disgusting! It's on film
The moral of the story is.........he got talent.......but he needs to be HUMBLE.....This Is America
Shedeur is the black Zach Wilson. He's not that good. Period.
Red flags off the field aren’t quite the same as red flags in the locker room
Too bad he’s not LeBron‘s son. He would’ve been drafted already and he’d be on the field starting.😂
The teams don’t want that circus sitting on the bench and they don’t want his dad interfering with his long reach and microphone.
Charlie Ward 2.0
Slideur Sanders
Four NFL paid guys minimizing any potential problem in the NFL as low key and will blow over.  Rich throwing conspiracy theories making no sense trying to divert. What a joke.
I want anyone to just go to YouTube and type in Troy Aikman yelling. And thing to yourself what would happen if Shedeur did that.
If he a legitimate starter,  teams would put up with the baggage that comes with him.  Clearly he is not.
How about reacting to all the good qbs who got drafted?
Tim Tebow got more chances than anyone
WE NEED OUR OWN LEAGUE!!!! WE NEED SEPARATION. BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL. THEN LETS SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL THE NFL AND NBA WILL BE.?
If any of this is true then there’s a lot of coaches that doubt themselves.
EVERYONE: "Please just tell us about the players our team picked."  COMMENTATORS: "WHAHHHH!!!!  WE WANNA TALK ABOUT SHEDEUR!!!!!"
Trumps mad too
Bottom line: Shedeur Sanders is not Eli Manning or John Elway, but Neon Deion thought he was and sabotaged his chances with bad advice.
He more concerned about looking good than playing good
Riley Leonard Quinn Ewers Shedeur hell Kyle Mycord>>>> Shough Gabriel Milroe
DO NOT select this guy!!!!! It’s a mistake! He needs to go back to college!
lol, Legendary
Yeah Reese, all 32 team owners got together and had a meeting about teaching him a lesson! Lmao! The media and Deion criticizing anyone that dares critique shadeur, no team owner,coach,teammate wants that drama in their locker room! Teams are hiring employees and I heard he only took a couple teams interviews seriously and now he’s paying the price! The way the media is treating this is shameful! A lot of players don’t get drafted when they should have, what about them?
Deion and Shadeur are the Trump family of football. They’re goofs, and anyone serious wants nothing to do with them. Clowns cause a circus
They want him to call them and ask for forgiveness for being himself. What the H---!
If you phoned in the interview process either because you thought you were a shoe-in for the position or because you didn’t really want to work for the franchise then not picked isn’t personal. It’s a direct consequence of your actions.
This is BS! Why should Shedeur have to beg? It’s personal, if it weren’t, why are we saying he should’ve been selected by now.
Who wants his dad constantly talking and keeping things sturd up. His dad constantly went from team to team trying to control the narrative. It's not Sheduer it's Deon.
Kid thought he was bigger than the game. Not interviewing with every team, skipping on the draft workouts. Yeah good luck with that
NIL means nothing in NFL😂NCAA is broken
Rich capping for sanders family way too hard. They were jerks in the meetings let’s keep it real
Give Joel Klatt credit here. He recognizes what has happened. He was high on Sheduer prior to the draft but what media scouts are not privy to are the personal interactions between the prospect and the NFL teams. It’s a two way street in the  interviews and interactions. The prospect has to be open and available to the draft process. If they are not then why would you pick a QB for your team who already is not cooperating with the team or teams wanting to scout him?
Literally all of the takes stated the obvious that the comments don’t seem to comprehend … it is personal!
Rich eisen is so annoying
Jets fan since I was 7 in 1965. Right, #12. Standing at the grocery store last night with a dude my age talking to the bag kid about Sanders -in Montana. Zags will be back in the big time again. Last Best Place.
Guys stop with all the naratives. You "analyst" obviously rated sanders way higher then the nfl did. Sanders just isnt a great prospect. He has no super special attirubute just solid all the way around. He reminds me of mac jones
It's "apparent to me" that the NFL Owners, GM's, Coaches, Scouts, Agents and Corporations have engaged in the "White-Balling" of Sheduer Sanders, Personally and the University of Colorados, Deion Sanders ability to use the Transfer Portal to build a Winning Culture for Years to Come! They Despise this "Blueprint" he has taken advantage of in College Football by a "Blackman and a Man of The Most High GOD"!
You guys must not have watched him play this season when Travis Hunter was hurt he is a 4 - 5 round talent anyone saying otherwise is just crazy. Colorado ran the score up on bad teams and lost against good teams. He is going to be a good quarterback but he is not yet pro ready and we need a couple years to grow.
Rich is blind. Players now run the league and the league owners are taking it back
The NFL... giving everyone the ole "baby reveal" trick with this one...get ya numbers up NFL....get ya numbers up...
The only way a player drops like this is because of a physical issue.
Mike Tomlin is awful at controlling his locker room
He's never been benched. He's never had to compete for his starting job. He is not a mentally resilient individual.  He will go undrafted.
You guys are beating around the bush. I get it. You can’t say it. This is about specific statements Deon Sanders has made, that have threatened the integrity of the league. He sat in interviews and stated his son would not play in specific cities. He said “this is going to be an Eli”. He said that he would determine where his son was going to play. Now the owners have clearly banded together, colluded, conspired. Call it whatever you want. But Sanders is now being punished because his dad could not keep his mouth shut.
The Shedeur story  in the 2025 draft is so heartbreaking.
Give Rich Eisen an Oscar for acting like he’s outraged and doesn’t understand why Sanders hasn’t been drafted.   He knows exactly why.  Teams don’t want to draft an entitled jackass who believes that he “God’s” greatest creation and who will blame everyone but himself the first time he faces any adversity in the NFL, for the most IMPORTANT POSITION ON THE TEAM.  If he were a WR or DB, sure, you gamble on the talent.  But not for the QB position.    And no, this is not a RACE issue.   It’s a CULTURE issue.   How many Super Bowl winning QBs can you name who act like Deon and his son?   This isn’t complicated.
I think some of what’s going on with sanders is that he’s not quite a starter and his name/celeb/noise is too loud for teams to want to deal with as a back up
They want him to beg and gravel….FOH
Staying off of social media for sanders and focusing on football not the other stuff would be legendary
If Sanders never plays a down in the NFL no one would ever miss him.  QB is the face of the organization. Lesson that’s needs to be learned here is sanders needs to be more like Dak Prescott when it comes to leadership , humbleness and putting others first .
This is a wake up call to these players that are arrogant. Sanders talent is first round. His thought process is undrafted. Tom Brady told him to get in the film room.
Sanders dropped out because he basically told the NFL to screw off he did he was bigger than them well the NFL is a monster of an organization and the Sanders family ain't bigger than the NFL now they're telling you to screw off who's laughing now
Listen to his interview with Simms and Florio. He comes off like an idiot. Furthest thing from humble.
I think Baltimore should draft Sanders, coach him up and then trade him for ransom when half of the bad teams QBs fail.
Begger? Na
The Sanders fall is not hard to figure out. Why would a team draft a guy who thinks he is a superstar and acts like a superstar, but plays barely above average. The teams will draft guys with all kinds of off field issues if they think the guy is a game changer. They obviously don't want to deal with his entitlement when they see him as a backup.
This is what happens when your dad thinks he makes the rules
When did Tom Brady get drafted????
Bottom line...Dieon was worth the drama.  His son isn't worth the drama
Whaaa!! The Kardashians of the NFL aren't having everything go their way, boo hoo!   Dallas loves a circus, send him there to make Dak's life miserable.
There's something else going on. This isn't right.
They got rich around some busters
This will be the NFL's loss......how many other QBs were trained by Tom Brady?!?
It's not just play on the field. It's leadership and sounding like a know-it-all idiot. Most teams don't want someone that sounds like an uneducated, cocky, I'm the greatest, I was born for this, kind of idiot, leading their team. That's a bad look. Who wants someone like that leading the team. They didn't decide collectively, they decided individually .
We ain't begging NEVER
Teams don't want a player that's bigger than the team.
You aren't just drafting Shaduer.    You also are drafting his daddy.   No one wants to deal with Deion.
Rich, calm down. Sanders is like his dad. Its always about himself. Selfish, selfish, selfish!!!
Tom Brady was a better college qb then him and got drafted LAST. If it’s meant to be then it’s meant to be. iMO he’s not that good and got overhyped because of his dad. Let’s see where this is in 3-5 yrs. I may be wrong but time will tell
Yall are right with "TOE", but it aint "Talent", its "Team". And nothing Shedeur has done has made the teams believe he values Team Over Everything
Takes some outsized confidence to be rocking "Legendary" without ever facing an NFL defense.  Nobody is signing up for Deion Sanders confidence and ego without any work being put in.  This would be a reach that would break an advanced Yoga class.  They would never be talking to Shedeur, Deion would always be a presence.  I believe this draft pick would make the Rodgers signing by the Jets look successful.
This is a great group of guys. Much loved opinions
Can’t believe how much Rich is caping for his buddy Deion. They retired his jersey after he did nothing to deserve it, his dad has all the time in the world to be on social about his son, and they got THE FREAKING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES to tweet about how upset he is. Bit sure these red flags are just like other players lol
The dude is just not really that good.  Look at this record. It sucks.     And he gets his # retired because of his daddy.  Lmao.
Who wants a player on their team to have their dad putting in his 2 cents on every little thing they do. I'd draft him only if his dad would sign a contract saying he'd keep his nose and mouth out of our business!!!!
This is a league of petty losers. I will be boycotting. I'm out.
Nobody wants daddy Deion as part of the deal
In his head he was already "legendary"
His ego is bigger then his talent. He is not as good as his dad to have all that ego and arrogance. He thinks he's bigger then the franchise and the NFL humbled him
He’s a great value at a 4th round pick unless everyone missed something.  Hell as a jets fan I’d take him cause if fields don’t work out we didn’t lose much w sanders and money
Shedeur should have stayed in college
Another overqualified Black man begging for a job in the NFL?... And he's the problem?
Sanders' arm strength is suspect & the difference in skill between college ball and the pros is huge.  If he's lucky he'll be a back up somewhere.  I wouldn't get within a mile of him or his father. Too much drama in the making.
The talent level doesn’t warrant the headache.
its simple, what coach would draft him knowing his dad will be targeting their job? makes no sense for them to have that pressure
If you watched his tape he was able to get away with a lot of stuff in the college stage. In the nfl those windows close faster and he could get picked apart. He can def improve but he is a project for a team and not a franchise altering player that should go in the first few rounds. This qb was so weak that it hyped up sanders and some of that was the media along with the sanders family. I think he is a backup in the league that under the right situation and development could turn into a starter down the line. Will he be able to be coached to allow that is another what if. He will go in day 3 and hopefully he takes that as a wake up call that he needs to put in the work otherwise he won’t last in the league very long.
Definitely personal— especially with us being in the NIL era. They’re making an example of Sanders smh
I think they're doing Shedeur like this bc his dad spoke out about not allowing him to go to certain teams! I think they didnt draft him to humiliate him, and show his dad,  that he doesn't have as much power as he think he does! Thats unfortunate! Maybe Deion need to sit back and stay quite bc this is his son future!
This is for joe klatt-  I feel ur future standing with colorado wont be the same.  Idk if ur slightly bothered by the number retirement, and u maybe not getting enough recognition as a former buff qb... but the sh!t ur tryna explain rn is not making sense sir. Why are u trying to explain away wtf we ALL KNOW is happening. This seems like betrayal. You've been around the program & should have insight h u didnt come to bat one time for the brotha in these comments? You really suggests he calls teams & gravel at their feet??  Thats a mfkn joke. There is no way in hell u really respect a player & advise him to do that.   So in the grand scheme of things- this is troubling.   To me, joe now represents all of colorado (alum & old white folk, not young students)- THEY ALL REALLY HATE THE SANDERS FAMILY BUT SINCE THEY'RE WINNING & MAKING THE TEAM & TOWN SO MUCH MONEY, YOU CANT SAY ANYTHING.  Well, that is until u see the very first chance to clown them, such as now. Advising the top qb to beg teams for a chance is a passive aggressive & subtle way of clowning a brothaa. How do i say i hate you without saying i hate u? Joe just showed us.  With this confirmation- its time deion exits colorado. Cause if a former cu buff qb who is atound & in the know can say something like this in public- you know its worse in private & there is no REAL support.  This was very eye opening, joe.  I hope deion get outta there. Colorado ppl only tolerate sanders family cause all the $ & attention.  Wow.  Nfl back to its good ol boy ways.
He shouldn't have to call anyone and say anything.  His play should be enough.  But the black man gotta call and beg smh
‘Let me push back’… Rich’s face was perfect. ‘How about you let me finish what I was saying?
ARROGANCE turns off. UNEARNED ARROGANCE REPELS. Here's hoping Shedeur learns the right thing--humility.
Last minute phone calls doesn't seem like a winning strat.
6:11  no way he would do that you don’t go all your life acting like his father and then all of the sudden go “dark”
These teams aren’t passing on him based on a media narrative. They’re passing on him because they all sat down with the kid face to face and said “no thanks”
If sanders was a white quarterback they wouldn’t be talking about it the coach that said he was the wrist interview he has ever heard is right sanders needs to look in the mirror and fix himself first
Did it too himself . Dad didnt help either lol
Everyone is acting like the kid is ENTITLED to be drafted. He’s not. This isn’t some conspiracy
They want Shedeur to beg!?!?! Humiliation ritual ... But for his father cuz they couldn't get to Deion before now
Look, these teams are looking towards next years draft class. They feel it is full of talent. Not every person will be a success in a field their dad was succeesful in. I hate when celebs, entertainers, etc. Try to push their children in the spotlight to do the same thing they did. Were their parents successful in that field before them? No. There is a slim chance your kid will follow in your footsteps. If it is something he wants, go out their keep your mouth quiet, and grind for it. Their are other outlets and avenues you can take. Sometimes, you have to go through adversity in order to get to where you're supposed to be. And sometimes life shows us you have to change some things in order to become greater than what you could be in life. This young man can be led by hs father, but at some point, he ultimately has to step out from his shadow and show that he is his own person and will humbly accept the role of earning the respect and adulation of his peers by performing at a high level with his talents. I would be in the gym right now, working out building muscles and grinding hard, transforming my body to become one of the greats.
Deon literally said “there’s some cities his son won’t play for”! Well here it is! This youngin is being humbled! He absolutely needs it! It will make him better!
They are doing something personal to him. We've seen him play, and I refuse to have hidden racism to pretend like he's not a good player or person. He went through all of college without any issues.
Deion stole the #1 recruit Travis Hunter from FSU by backstabbing them. Travis Hunter was already going to be a top pick in the draft. Travis Hunter made Shedeur and Deion look good, not the other was around.
His character is the issue
No team wants that kind of "distraction" at backup QB. Shedeur and Deion Sanders brought this all on themselves. Through the first FOUR rounds, the juice ain't worth the squeeze. I'm not sure taking Sanders in the final few rounds makes any more sense. A distraction is a distraction.
Even TRUMP is trying help shedeur out!
His talent and tape isn’t enough he has to call and beg. Proves the point this isn’t about football it’s about trying to humble someone who is already humble
I’m with Charles Davis on this the freaking browns traded for a freak off QB and they r scared of shadur ? Makes no sense I think this is some organizational PS period !!!!!!!! No teams want him to beg for an opportunity give me a break DJ
At the end of the phone call, Shedeur will say “Legendary.” 😉
Sanders story is Tom Brady 2.0 in the making.
Coach John Wooden attitude
Stop gaslighting the audience we see what's going on here y'all take people with redflags all the time like johnny football others so stop the gaslighting the fans you mean to tell if he problems with mechanics or playstyle a coach can't fix that what the hell are they getting paid for then we know what this about there trying to break this kid's confidence and sending a message to the sanders family.....
Wait wait wait everyone. Let’s not forget how this was a few months ago… I remember how the narrative was that prime would only allow him to play for certain teams in certain city’s. Don’t give us this sorrow speech bs now. You make your bed you lay in it. Let’s not forget about ALL the greats that went way later than we expected… that were passed over time and time again. When did the GOAT go? Few more things to remember. The NFL is a privilege it is not a right. Humble pie never hurt anyone. Also let’s not forget the soldiers, law enforcement, fire and ems, doctors, nurses, heck just say ALL the worlds workers that keep the world turning that are making peanuts compared to what all these kids are about to make. No more sob stories
When you reflect on yourself, be yourself,  don't change you for no man!
Rich pushing agendas, c’mon man.
There were players charged with sexual assault selected so I don't really want to hear about character when the player we are talking about has done nothing wrong off the field.
What’s happening is you guys on TV haven’t been objective and honest bc you want to be friends with Deion and you know if you say anything critical about him or his sons you will be kicked out of the club. NFL GM’s are trying to win games and keep their jobs. You’re trying to make friends. That’s what’s happening. These GM’s will draft a convicted felon on parole if they thought it would help them win games so don’t give me that crap.
Colllusion is Alive n Well in the National Football League
To me he was either an early first round pick (top 10) or he was a bust maybe 6th round or even undrafted. Why? Well the kid calls himself Legendary, has way too much media baggage following him and comes across as arrogant and self centered. No team is drafting these issues unless they plan to start the guy, and this year there are not that many teams in need of a QB1 rookie. Can honestly see him not being drafted at all now we are this far through.
He may be better off going updrafted. Then he can choose his own team.
You don’t need to look any further than the player he was most compared to see why this is all happening: Cam Ward.   Supremely confident while not being arrogant Is the better prospect by a fairly wide margin (opinion) No dad issues/interference Played for coaches other than his dad Didn’t throw to an insane talent like Hunter Didn’t tell cities not to draft him Held a pro day instead of telling teams to “watch the tape” <- (I know what he meant and he’s not wrong, but I can also see where teams want every chance to see the future face if the franchise in action up close)  I just don’t think teams want to family interference mostly. I love Deion, but he’s divisive. He got away with it when he played because he was on a path to the HoF while Shadeur hasn’t even played an NFL down at the most important position. Also Deion had the leverage to say, “I’ll just go play baseball” if he wanted to.  Elway got away because he also had baseball and was clear top pick.  Eli got away with it because Peyton was lighting the league up at the time and nobody wanted to miss out on the next Manning QB as again, he was a clear top pick.
Generally, no one likes people who are so into themselves as much as the Sanders kid.  All that self-aggrandizing and misguided expression of confidence points to one thing: he doesn’t really have it.
If it's true that the Sanders camp wouldn't even talk to teams outside of the top 10 because they didn't think he would still be there, then I don't see why those teams should feel obligated to keep him on their draft boards.
Rich proving yet again he doesn’t listen doesn’t understand I’m Rich my views are right I don’t care if u are a senior exec or coach in an NFL franchise I’m right and ur actions re Saunders are all wrong.🥴
Seems like this all but guarantees Steelers will now turn to over-the-hill narcissist Aaron Rodgers as QB? Honestly, that is SHOCKING bad judgement. Shedeur may be full of himself but he's a good QB in the making.
Can't teach someone who thinks they know everything.
Smells of collusion
When you tell everybody you only wanna play for New York Las Vegas or Pittsburgh this is what happens.
It is really not that complicated, Sanders is not really that good. In the 2024 Draft he would have gone in the last 3 rounds if his name was not Sanders. This is happening because of all the BS that comes with drafting him, it is not worth it, if he was as good as Jayden, Drake, or Caleb then some teams will put up with it, but why put up with it for a back up or third stringer. There's no one to blame but Shedeur and Deion.
Relax everyone,Tom Brady was a 5th round pick
There’s no plot. Some team would have taken him if they thought he was good. They don’t. They think he is an overhyped, stat manipulated player who won’t be able to hack it in the NFL. That’s it.
Sanders is a media sensation, nothing much more. Avg QB, .500 record.  With a toxic attitude.
Shedeur Sanders he did this to his self by telling teams what he is going to do plus when something goes wrong he blames every one else.      And his dad said he will be with him every step of the way when a team draft a player that the only one the want the don't want his dad to that the reason teams not drafted him because his dad can't stay out of it.
Shedeur's talent says he should be gone by now?   Bwahahahahahahahaha....
Listen, you gotta be good enough to get drafted. I watched a lot of Colorados games and I wasn’t seeing anything great. He’s got a slow release, no zip, and he holds the ball too long. Not very mobile either.   We can’t let the NFL become what the NBA is. Bronny James is the example I’m referring to. Don’t let our football get ruined.
The NFL was disrespected by Shedeur not following the process and thinking he WAS bigger than the League...starting by not going to combine...The nfl needs to make a point that it WILL be respected by anyone. No one is bigger than the league. He is getting a legendary humiliating lesson.
Maybe it's not Sanders talent maybe teams don't want all the attention grabbing going on, on the sidelines ?
Collusion
As a Browns fan living in Colorado I am furious that they wouldn't take a chance on  Sanders. Dillion Gabriel is the same garbage the browns have been feeding their fans for the decades. It's perfectly normal for the Browns to be utterly stupid. After all it is the worst run organization in the league hands down. But what is going on with the rest of the teams in the league?
He just isnt that good lol
Joel Klatt sucked up all the attention and clout from Shedour and the whole Colorado program all year since its the school that he went too and now when Shedour needs him to have his back he gives this weasel of an answer…. Disloyal humans are a special type of evil
Why does he have to sale himself when he already did that in college by his play on the field in college
Humble pie is being served, & the kid still isn’t learning.
You all can say what you like! They were supposed to win almost no games last year. He proved all these people wrong! He took an unpopular, team with no market and not only made them winners, but he has Boulder on the map! They’re making money! Business is about P&L! (Profit and Loss) NFL teams just showed you winning isn’t a factor
The kid wouldn’t have saw a d1 field without his dad. And even if you believe he is decent. No team wants his or his dad’s drama. It’s not hard to see why.
Saskatoon Baby!
Joe klatt preaching rn, yall need to listen. The cockiness of sanders is UNWARRANTED. HE HAS DONE NOTHING. NO-THING. Why the hell is he WORTHY of being drafted high?!?
What distraction are they speaking of????
maybe they just dont see much development left in his talent, and he isnt that good?  I see all this stuff saying that if Deion wasnt his dad, he would have been selected already.  are we sure?  if he wasnt Deion's son, he probably wouldnt even be considered.  he had a nice season at JSU, but then went what? 12-12 at colorado??  the lack movement are arm strength talent + the extra BS doesnt make him very appealing.
NFL did dirty on him, it’s very clear now, he would not be a 1st round pick, fine, but at this point for a 3rd round pick, its a bargain. Not drafting him is a choice beyond the player.
The NFL has standards. There is a line you can cross. Thats a good thing
Wow rich stans so hard for sanders
I’m losing so much respect for Rich Eisen. He is going against what he has said about other QBs to support his buddy Deon.
Hahahaha, the Steelers became a circus under Tomlin. It is still a circus.
Nobody wants the drama that Sanders brings with him?
It’s so obvious… his father’s influence on him . Teams worried tune out head coach and listen to Prime . With all respect Rich seems to be taking it personally. Which is disappointing to me as a fan of his show.
LV picking Jack Bech, what a great pick
ESPN sucks sanders is a  USF or Canada skill set get over it and the racial bullshit
Its clear Rich can't be unbiased about this. Shedeur is clearly being cocky and acting like he's in the hall already. Deion was acting like his kid owned the NFL for two years.
They are trying to teach them a lesson. But GOD doesn’t make mistakes. But it amazing when a family makes sure that the young man is good they wanna penalize them. The machine hates when a real father takes pride and time to make sure his kid is taken care of. Because his father is GOD fearing and knows what’s right, for his son, and he penalized, it’s terrible. Makes me wanna back off watching the league, This past year was the first time i didn’t handicap football as well.
It is simple shadeur is really unlikeable
All who love justice and fairness should boycott the NFL. These talking heads trying to justify this crap is sickening. I hate this injustice. I hope the NFL folds and goes bankrupt.
I hope the Chiefs draft him so we can all get more Chiefs coverage and prime games.  😂
Who wants the head ache (sanders).....it's just not worth it ....
Why should he have to beg to get in the league?? That’s crazy work!!! The man has 1st round talent, no drama off the field, good grades, with confidence I see nothing wrong with that.
Bottom line...Guy in the black jacket is a Sanders hater. He should've been drafted by now and it is personal. Yes the young man needs to tighten up on some things but definitely should've been drafted by now.
This is on Deion
How the last 4 QBs better then sheduer I don’t it
Sanders should NOT beg. Just keep in mind a kid with a clean record, a clean bill of health and has one. Is having trouble being drafted but people like Johnny Menzel got picked no problem with all the red flags he had. A team literally drafted a 25 soon to be 26-year-old with three seasons that were ended by injury make it make sense.
Rich shilling the sanders again... shocker
Obvious... "he didn't code switch." NO. He doesn't have the character needed to lead an NFL team. That's all. I wouldn't pick him. That's a team cancer.
No team wants to deal with another Johnny Manziel.
Rich Eisen defending his boyfriend’s son with all his might 🤣
Juice ain’t worth squeeze
Deion said he would decide who drafts Shaduer
I like rich normally.  With this Rich is blinded by his friendship  with Deion. Coach don't see enough talent to justify losing their jobs to Deion.
I think the nfl just doesn’t think he’s that good. He was an under talent they would have picked him. Aside from murder the NFL will take you.
This whole situation is crazy and makes me really question how I feel about the league and the people who really have the power running it. Then the analyst on the right said this is an indictment??
What the MAN want him to do, BEG!!!! Lol TF!!! OUTTA HERE!!!!
Maybe his father shouldn’t have said they would reject some teams privately.  And no team wanted to deal with that.
The NFL just turned Shedeur into a villain
Don't beg these teams
The greatest QB of all time was drafred in the 6th round so just grind and hustle if you good as you think you are youll get to where you want to get
I’m so sick of hearing the word HUMBLE
Daddy hate
This giving Warren Moon/tom Brady draft process vibes
How is being drafted at any point, any round, a negative?  Thousands of FB players would kill for that golden ticket yet you guys whine and nash your teeth.  The draft isn't over
This is going to be another Brock Purdy type situation. Shadeur will end up the best quarterback in this draft class, just like Brock ended up being the best in his class despite being the last pick.
He just needs the opportunity and when he gets it, he’ll shine. He was bred for moments like this. Talent isn’t everywhere. It takes years to build and develop what Shedeur brings can bring to the table. Something feels off on this one.
Maybe hes 20 on DJ's big board because they over inflate the value of QBs in the draft for clicks and ratings ...
Great job Rich and Charles!! I believe that Charles wanted to say more but wanted to keep his job. Remember,  GOD DON'T LIKE UGLY!
Klatt is dumb.
Every other outlet reported that Sanders was all time terrible in interviews and that teams didn’t want that entitlement in a QB. NFL Network refuses to report it
It has to be public, because the NFL needs to be called out fir their BS
If Sanders was a WR, DB, CB... whatever he'd be drafted already. Sanders has his dad's personality with less talent at the wrong position
Man rich has forgot about the Tim Tebow situation and how billboards went up in the city and chants of Tebow when the broncos were losing it and sanders isn’t as good as Tebow
Rich’s is having a brake down!
Stop the nonsense everybody know what it is no one's begging for a job it's plenty money out if the nfl don't want him there fault....Archie manning said the same thing about Eli and Eli wasn't no where near elite none of these quarterbacks drafted are better maybe ward
Rich has a tough time understanding that a backup QB shouldn’t be getting THIS amount of attention.
i'd like to see him go to the Rams, sit behind Stafford for a year or two. Ball out in pre season and Stafford rarely plays all 17 !!
Fake hype just didn't work.  Sanders record speaks for itself. Meh at best.
So they what him to beg?
Let Rich Eisen talk! You cut him off cause he had the best point. What does Sanders need to self reflect on that Manziel and Mayfield didn’t have to? Sounds like guy in plum suit just hates Shedeur. Why is Rich even asking plum suit guy for his opinion. Then he scoffs when Rich says the league is making it personal. Fact from Rich!
You know what will be said “Must be racism” 🤣 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha 🤣
Joel’s a former Colorado QB who was singing shadeurs praises all season yet hes the only voice of reason on this panel
This whole situation is crazy and makes me really question how I feel about the league and the people who really have the power running it
Rich struggling to defend his buddy's son
NFL teams are not sending any message. NFL teams, if they believe a player is very good, they will draft him, because what they want more than anything else, is wins.  But that player has to be great, even with some baggage.   Several 1st round draft picks at quarterback have encountered legal problems.  Examples include Ryan Leaf, Todd Marinovich, JaMarcus Russell, and Art Schlichter.  Ryan Leaf, the #2 overall pick in 1998, was arrested on suspicion of breaking and entering.  Todd Marinovich, drafted in 1991, faced personal and legal issues, including those related to drugs.  JaMarcus Russell, the #1 overall pick in 2007, was involved in a DUI incident.  Art Schlichter, drafted in 1982, lost his signing bonus on gambling.   He just is not good enough to be 1st to 3rd round because all teams want to win.
Dont have all the information about the rooms of league officed but you pundits have all the information in the rooms that Shadeur doesn't self reflect. Ok.
All this racism talk is so stupid and the dumbest argument I’ve ever heard in my life. The most promoted and protected quarterback in the league is black. Last year two black quarterbacks were taken first and second overall in the draft. This year there was a black quarterback taken first overall in the draft. It has nothing to do with his race as to why he sliding. You can tell in his interactions with the media he doesn’t interview well and he’s incredibly entitled and arrogant. Plus his father has done him no favors, and coaching staffs know they will be undermined by him publicly. That’s what it’s about.
It’s a wake up lesson to him. To humble him by thinking he’s all that. You haven’t proved anything yet. I’d love to see him be this years Mr irrelevant to really let it sink in
This is added fuel for Shedeur. He'll have the last laugh
Who is that guy at the far right? Shedeur should "Call each GM".., and "BEG"????? That's NOT and should NOT happen. Did "Johnny Football" "beg" when he got drafted? This is just BS.
Lolololololol
Thank you NFL for letting this arrogant and middling QB fall to day 3 and not drafting him early for literally no reason. About time the Sanders idiots out there realized he’s not that good, and just because your daddy is famous and actually talented doesn’t mean you get to have the same life 😂
Sanders is not that good! STOP!!!
League sent a message that he's not good
NFL teams don't think he will be a starter anytime soon.  Second and third team QBs aren't a big priority in the early rounds, he will have to prove himself, by himself!
What do you expect when Deion said his son wasn't going to play for certain teams. Now they're at point where they're just hoping some team drafts him.
All these grown men on this tv broadcast and only one of them is telling Shedeur to hold himself accountable. The rest are blaming everyone else. Even one idiot saying it's personal. This is why so many kids growing up today are lost. There aren't very many real MEN around them anymore. Shame.
3800 yards of bubble screens doesnt make you a NFL QB
This is the same as Rich talking about Michigan.  He is blinded by his own bias.  The situation is simple.  Sanders has back-up NFL QB talent.  Not starting QB talent.  And no back-up QB is worth the circus.
Rich sounds like that guy who’s defending the OF chick’s honour thinking he has a chance. Shilo will get drafted before Shedeur at this point
This is personal there is no Way around it.
Many teams think Shedeur has Deion’s confidence, but not half  the talent. Decent arm & accuracy, but he needs to hit the weight room and seriously work on his speed & maneuverability. If you look at him, he’s got soft, fat legs. I’d get him on the track & in the weight room. And show some humility until you put up some consistent numbers in the big leagues.
This whole thing is ridiculous.  Shadeur isn’t even that cocky, is he flashy yeah but he’s pops is Deion and the kid has been rich all his life.  We’ve all seen his post game interviews, he has a very POISED AND CALM CONFIDENCE about himself NOT COCKINESS.  If anything he’s kinda reserved compared to his father and his brother.  I really don’t understand where this cockiness and he needs to “humble himself” narrative is coming from.  And as far as the word Legendary, I believe that’s his older brother’s brand and the sanders do their own media.  And they believe in the power of the tongue.  Words have power and the word legendary is something he uses to push him.  Because he has to be legendary being the son of a HOFer anything short of that would be a failure in his eyes.  If anything they should look at having the money and fame at a young age as a plus because a lot of kids can’t handle waking up one day being famous and having several millions of dollars in their bank account.  His motivation shouldn’t be an issue.  You really think this kid is hurting for cash? 😂😂 This whole this is crazy.
Dion was self centered son just like him NFL teams are not stupid
Did Aaron Rodgers have to pick up the phone and beg?
Shedeur acted like a top 5 pick(skipped Combine events, Snr Bowl etc) - when really his actual draft stock to the NFL was IMO at best- a late first rounder to 2nd rounder.  Still, Shedeur should have been QB3 after Ward and Jaxson.
Why can't people call a spade a spade. I guess they're worried about their jobs. Sanders was not picked because of his entitled personality! Nobody wants the Sanders circus coming to town. That's it !!!
He should go to broncos
Certain father and sons got treated differently with no problem hard stop. Now the league has a problem. Funny how that works. He's talented period. Sounds like excuses to me. Say what you want. Give him the opportunity instead of passing judgment. He's earned it.
I love Rich’s take on this. I hate how that guy said it basically pick up the phone and gravel to the owners to get a shot.
Thomas Sowell: Discrimination & Disparities. Read it, and let "disparities" sink in. Here's a clue--it only takes one.
I don't believe Shadeur is that good (but still good enough for the NFL). That being said I think the best thing for him is to go late in the draft. There's something you get from being passed over and that's a chip on your shoulder. Whichever team selects him is going to get someone that's going to prove everyone else wrong.
Dr. Neely Fuller warned him this could happen.💯
Charles Davis a real one
The fact that his mentor tom brady's team had so many picks and still dint select him is even more shocking.
There's obviously something character wise that everyone outside of the front offices aren't aware of.
You can tell Rich is still Dieon s buddy ..protecting him
I havent watched this situation intimately but in general when it comes to sports there is a balance. I know all experts were pretty confident but apparently they dont see him as the second coming of mike Vick or none of this would matter. The worst thing any player can do is start thinking the league needs them. Clearly he done pissed some people off.
Shedeuer isnt that good. Add that with his arrogance after winning nothing and entitlement. Try the CFL.
The two QBs in the national championship are still undrafted... Calm down 🙄😂
I think they hit the nail on the head when talking about not wanting the circus that would prob follow him. People talking about character and stuff are being a bit unfair. NONE OF US KNOW HIM. But hey, the greats are rarely first picks so I’m sure he’ll be fine.
I am so sick of the sports media talking about how talented he is.....not so fast!
Maybe hes just not that good
Throwing this out there. He wouldn't be the first Colorado QB to play WR/RB/special situations in the NFL. Rich's name drop of Mike Tomlin and Pittsburgh may be prescient later today.
I hope Shadeur goes to a good team and excels. Talking so much trash about a young man doesn't help anyone and it reflects badly on the person doing the talking
"Not Primetime"
You can tell Rich is still Dieon s buddy protecting him
Why are all the social media and camera rules only for Shadeur?
Klatt saying Sanders is first round good is BS! Sanders couldn't win a championship at HBCU level and Colorado a media story
Teams know that they get father & son in this deal and they don’t want that
Get em Rich💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Being Black Balled isn't a fun time but he will survive.
Gonna be a nationwide sensation and ticket-selling machine. And dad can handle life in a cold-weather city. Perfect for the Canadian Football League.
Someone needs to provide some answers because this is ridiculous at this point. He could have stay another year in college. To advise a kid to go beg is absurd
Owners there at 32 decided to make this poor kid suffer.
I'm sorry but every great play I've seen Colorado make in college I come away saying "Damn, that was a great catch by that receiver". I don't think I've ever watched one down and thought about it being a great play by the QB. Sanders is good no doubt just not great. He certainly isn't as great as he and his father thinks he is and there's nothing wrong with that. As a dad you should think your son is the best.
It’s pretty simple no coach or  GM wants to be threatened by Dion becoming the coach who would draft his son under those circumstances
He's going to Jacksonville with Hunter! You seen it here.
No coach wants Coach Dad up in their business.
These teams want to win period. If they thought he was good enough he would have been drafted. It’s not personal it’s business!
Aaron Rodgers the Diva don’t want the spot light on a kid who’s sitting behind him.
Rich was the only one here to say the obvious. Everybody else gaslighted the entire time to justify this public display of disrespect to the Sanders family.
See Aaron Rodgers, ‘nuff said
He appears to be a head case with baggage, is his father going to interfere with the team his son is playing on? Was he over hyped by the media and how many times has that happened to a quarterback coming out of college. Who told Jalen Milroe to sit in the green room during the first round and how did that make Jalen feel sitting in there and not be called until the later part of the third round. These talking heads never take responsibility for pumping these young players with so much praise and the he is a number one draft pick and they sit there with camera's on them feeling humiliated.
They signed a QB to the highest guaranteed contract with S/A issues but they are sending a message.
When Sanders first started to slide, I thought it was because he was clearly overhyped and just wasn't 1st round material.  Not getting picked on day 2 though, now I think its that and more so teams being unwilling to sign up for the Deion circus.  And I actually think all these teams are wise for it.   If its to be remembered, there was some point in this past season Deion said his kid wouldn't play for certain teams.  I think those teams, probably QB needy, received the message.
Beg?? 👀😒
This is a very entertaining train wreck lol~
Personality is huge.  Nobody wants to draft someone who has been told he is something he isn’t by his dad.  He’s probably good, and hopefully this humbles him a bit.
If a regular person goes on a job interview and acts like he's seen and done it all and that he is all that and a bag of chips, what do you think his chances of being hired would be?
Can’t believe one of these idiots suggested that Shedeur “beg” the League to get selected. Naaaaw - I think Shedeur would walk away from the game - secure in himself that he is better than most QBs selected - before he begs billionaire owners who will earn more billions from his presence on their team.
Shedeur should talk to Brock Purdy. Not being picked should light a huge fire.  Shedeur talks about God: Well, God opposes the proud and gives grace to the humble.  If he humbles himself, stays off of social media and gets after it this whole thing can turn around.
Something is not adding up. How can Deion be all about teaching all of his players including his sons how to be a Pro and now anonymous sources say Shedeur was unprofessional during draft process? I’ve seen nothing but professionalism and belief in his game as he dealt with this draft process and now we are here. The NFL is no different from corporate America. There’s a lot of bias that seeps into hiring processes unless you’re very intentional about rooting it out. At this point, they’re not even evaluating his performance and skill.
You can't help who he is that dude been around all these ballers all his life
I'm for what teams are doing with him teaching him a lesson he is entitled and thinks he is owed, being in the nfl is a given not a right
cool story, but the Eagles still won the Super Bowl 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
I understand what Rich is saying about the league taking players with red flags all the time. But those players are usually elite if they are drafted high. If they aren’t that elite they usually fall rounds 3-5.
Rich they corny for not drafting him, we gonna act like Sanders didn’t bring College Football back lol ? We gonna act like the views didn’t go up ? We gonna act like Dart is actually a “great qb” 😭? We gonna act the giants aren’t stuck in 1917 ? To much plantational  politics going on man 👀. The NBA >NFL I see why now.
7:52 Perfectly said 👏 💯
Absolutely right Sanders showed GM who he really was. They said thank you because we dont like who you are.
4 people on the stage. One of them is a industry plant 🪴
Teams don't want the headache that comes with Shedeur. He said things pre draft that set off alarm bells to owners for whatever reason. They want no part of the circus. Its the same thing that happened with Kaepernick, except Sanders is actually good. CK brought a circus, owners said no thanks and you aren't that good. Sanders brings a circus, but he can play decent. His mouth and attitude cost him everything.
Or just maybe he isnt talented enough to be a starter. The media way over hyped Sanders for the last few years. Plus do you really want a guy that just quits on your team and goes into the locker room when you're down by 3 scores in the 4th quarter.
This mofo on the screen literally said he needs to pick up the phone and beg for job.  Gtfoh!  You had white QB's in the past actually way worse than Sheduer.  Let's keep it 💯.  So are we're going to sit here and say Baker Mayfield and Johnny Manziel wasn't overly cocky? They didn't have a lot of self belief?  They weren't flashy?  Of course they were and the good ol boys in the back room looked at it as confidence. When they do it it's ok but when we do it it's a problem!!
If S. Sanders has other skills and abilities, I’d withdraw my name from draft & go pursue that & buy $200k worth of XRP and be at ease.  Don’t beg for anything !!!!
Beg.??? Really?? He has NO reason to beg.
He got blown out in Colorado final but still got his jersey retired idk
Overreaction Monday, ON A FRIDAY!
Shedur sanders has too much class to go through the evils of the dirty nfl and it's slave owners it's jealousy of the father
So you telling me the NFL will bring in rappers who promote murder selling drugs raping  women ETC but have a problem with this young man 🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯
They didn't say this about Johnny Manziel, Baker Mayfield, or any of the draft picks with criminal charges pending.
Rich keeping real with what's really going on it's personal going at Deion and his family
He is being Black balled there isn't any other way to look at it
This is what happens when the media props up a player that doesn’t actually have talent. Even the highlight clips they showed in this video would be interceptions in the NFL.
I’ve never seen the analysts literally PITCHING a player to teams more than this. It’s actually pathetic lol
Dumb as rocks?
Why should he have to beg!!! His work should speak for itself!!! BS💩💩💩
LMAO Hey! What was wrong with Warren Moon! Talent through the roof, no off the field issues. Won the Rose Bowl against Michigan. Had to go to Canada and win 5 Grey Cups... we all know what this is. The Shield being the Shield
If social media was around when his father came out of college…. As good as he was, it would’ve been an issue as well. I remember my father ready to puke after watching this guy interview…. With that said he was a great player, but he did make everybody cringe whenever he was on the camera doing any sort of promotion for himself.
HE’S JUST NOT THAT GOOD!!
After 3 rounds, I would NOT draft Shedeur Sanders for the very simple reason of what are the chances of a backup of a backup QB playing? If he is not playing, what would his "loud-mouthed" father do? Remember LaVar Ball? How he was when his son was not playing? A distraction of epic proportion, right? So, if Sanders cannot get his pass completions, would his father blame the team? Can a team afford such a distraction?
The question is is his talent worth the circus. The answer so far is no.
Come on Rich..if Tomilson and Steelers don’t want Sanders at QB it must be pretty bad
Tom Brady was a fourth rounder.   Don’t act like that teams aren’t ever wrong!
Sanders family SHOOK 🤣🤣🤣🤣
LEGENDARY MEETS SADNESS!
Arrogant Aloof and Entitled - everything a team looks for in a Quarterback.
Thank you Rich for keeping it solid. Your cohost directly next to you is officially Karen Kamala Harris in my book.
Granted you guys have to fill air time with conversation but good night nurse, some of the stuff you say is soooooooo far off base. Makes one wonder if any of you have played a sport, been part of a team, coached, etc.   The fact of the matter is he looks very average in every way. He played for an average team that had an average record. And they got absolutely crushed by BYU in a bowl game at the end of the season. Teams are simply thinking there are better players on the board in front of him. No need to psycho analyze or question his character.
WHY IN THE HELL DID THE SAINTS CALL SHEDEUR AND WHO GAVE HIM THE NUMBER 😡
The Definition of Moving the Goalposts
Rumor is he actually argued with Daboll. I'd love to hear what happened.
Saying Shadeur should have to call and beg GMs is fucking pitiful
If you're going to have that attitude and baggage you gotta be generational. Sanders is average, and that's why.
Is Arch Manning walking Jesus?? Is he washing the feet of the poor like the pope? He grew up in a family where 2 people were worth hundreds of millions of dollars thats a way better life than Deions son. When Arch comes out I HAD BETTER HEAR HOW THATS A HINDERANCE GROWING UP SO DAM PRIVILEGED OK!!!  This is how we stop people from saying everything is racist BY HOLDING EVERYONE TO THE SAME DAM STANDARDS!!!  If ur one of those people who absolutely hate the word racism or racist you should be the first on board!! Same dam standards. Arch has a passing percentage of 70 plus DOESN'T MATTER HE's NOT PLAYING SEC DEFENSES EVERY WEEK. JUST LIKE DEIONS SON!!  Same dam standards!!!
Rich Eisen haa embarrassed himself throughout this entire draft process
Shedeur is just over qualified, that's the truth.
Raiders should get him Tom Brady is in the building I don’t get it
You can tell rich in tight with Deon and others up there don’t care lol
No one wants the clown show that goes with this kid. It's suppose to be about football not clicks!
Let’s go pats
Not any good at all. I've seen better for sure..quite crying 😢 😭 😪 😫
Sanders is a great athlete. He's not an NFL quarterback. The reality is if there were a god it wouldn't care if ants play a sport...
Shedeur Sanders stats speaks for themselves. I don’t think he shouldn’t have to reach out or apologize to anyone to justify who he is as a person or player. If there were concerns relating to his personality, the interviewers should have addressed those highlights during the interview. I think honesty goes both ways in this case.   This process of acclamation is a form of mental measurables . What’s happening now, is nothing more than pure punishment. This form methodology could completely demolish a kid’s belief in what suppose be a system, that’s based off the team’s need and individual talent.   At the end of the process, there’s nothing wrong with coaches saying to a player, you’re not the best fit for our program.
Shedeur Sanders is a me first guy. Just like his father was. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. That kind of crap doesn't work in today's NFL.
Rich Eisen simping for the Sanders so hard.  Come on Rich. All these other people can see. Why not you???
They wanna buck break Shedeur in front of the world as an example.
I'm wondering if the LeBron and Bronny thing has something to do with this....teams not wanting that type of distraction....
Stop trying to explain Sanders. He doesn’t have enough talent to put up with circus period….. Others with less talent were taken because they come without the other crap. The talking heads made him more than he was and now want to explain how they weren’t wrong. Ridiculous! Best advice given from these so called experts, get on the phone with teams and try a little bit of humble pie. And please talk more about all the wonderful young men that were taken.
Rich u are totally right on That's what they're doing to Sanders
Everybody is so high on an entitled 7th round QB. It’s funny how no one says that Deion said to a random guy my sons gonna be a top 5 pick what’s your son do lol. Ya bring that character flaw up ESPN.
What if Deion is telling no team to draft him and Shedeur is an undrafted free agent that picks where he wants to play
Granted you guys have to fill air time with conversation but good night nurse, some of the stuff you say is soooooooo far off base. Makes one wonder if any of you have played a sport, been part of a team, coached, etc.   The fact of the matter is he looks very average in every way. He played for an average team that had an average record. And they got absolutely crushed by BYU in a bowl game at the end of the season. Teams are simply thinking there are better players on the board in front of him. No need to psycho analyze or question his character.  Why not spend time talking about first rounders and their success rather than stew in the disappointment of a later round pick.
This league absolutely passes on talent. It’s rare, and it’s always strategic — but they do it.
If Sanders and Colorado had played SEC teams, he would have been on his back all afternoon long. His stats look good against weak teams. He played no one; it's not his fault, but still.
There doing him dirty.
You sleep in the bed you made… IMHO. I learn that in my life.
They keep referring to the tape. The tape isn't good. All those unnecessary interceptions are real.
Deion made comments about 'who he would and wouldn't play for'. Why would a team use a pick to draft and and him turn around and go 🖕? The more i think about it, i think that may play into this more than everyone thinks. Its just too much baggage with him, and Deions meddling and bs has and still is hurting his son. Its not 1989. Deion got away with this approach then...not today.
This is why he hasn't been drafted yet because the entire media over hyped this kid simply because he was Deion son...if this was anyone else with the same productivity in college nobody would had considered him a top pick...
"There needs to be some deep reflection, and he needs to humble himself. Maybe if some calls are made.."  THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS ABOUT‼️ They want him to humble himself and beg. What's even more pathetic. It's not even about Shedeur. It's about humbling his FATHER!
Rich is friends with Deon. I get it but the bias is clear
So now he’s a victim?  Give me a break.  He didn’t get drafted because of WHO he is as a person.  Maybe he and his dad should have a long look in the mirror and reevaluate their behavior
has there ever been a players whose intangibles tank his stock this badly? The talent level is not commensurate with his ego.....but then again, *no one's* talent is commensurate with his ego.
Any backup who does not think he should start shouldn’t be in the league. Social media for players can be shutdown and reports sniffing around a player is nothing new to the league. This is crazy.
It looks pretty bad when you have a team that trades for an abuser but wont touch a confident kid with a ten foot pole. It looks worse when you then ask that kid to beg for a job.
I went to Texas A&M and watched Johnny Manziel be 10X worse than Shedeur off the field and get picked 22nd. Johnny had a better college career winning the Heisman but she skill set isn’t that different. This is a coordinated hit on the Sanders family
If you know a player might, just might, be an issue in the locker room and he not needed to be a day one starter why would you take them? Could be go undrafted?
Social media played s big part of Sanders situation.
Rich has a good point here. Deshaun Watson got a massive contract from the Browns after his accusations came out, but Shadeur's ego is too out of control for the league?
Is this, not wanting to deal with him, or his dad?
I lost so much respect for the nfl
Nah...we have crossed the rubicon. We can't beg now. Hell nah. Free agent it is.
Beg for a job?   Jesus this is the worst analysis ever
That the Shadeur story took over over 3/4 of this video seems pretty indicative of how him being a backup quarterback could go. No one wants that in their locker room.
A guy with a ego like Shedeurs must have been crying.
4:05 WRONG Bailey zappe had the cameras in his locker and he was picking at Mac Jones each week hinting he should be playing, while also noticeably disengaged and unhelpful to Mac on the sideline in the role he was in as the back up. It was an enormous ingredient in the mix that pushed MJ over the edge mentally.   This is even more ripe for that.
It’s simple- S Sanders is the NFL  equivalent of the circus coming to town. Teams are sending message- we are not having that.
You mean like Cleveland, who gave a fully guaranteed 230 MILLION dollar contract while said player had over 24 sexual assault charges?!🤷🏼‍♂️😳🙄
Sometimes teams have to consider a players Baggage and his Talent. and it looks like teams are saying his baggage is too much.
His daddy will be a distraction if he doesn't play or if another QB starts. AND the media will arbitrarily stir "Will Coach Prime coach is son now at X Team?". Unnecessary media coverage for a QB that finished 13-12 and got his number retired cause he broke records. Huh?
I understand potentially not 'acing' team interviews, but wonder why the Payton Manning predraft demand hasn't been mentioned in this discussion...Any comments 🤔
I am at a lost as to why Sanders has not been selected. He does not have off the field issues such as drugs, women or other things that have been overlooked in the past. I think it is a punishment to the Sanders family for not going to the combine and not begging to play.
Guys it’s so simple Steelers gonna take him or raiders   It they know they can get him in the 4 or 5th  They aren’t gonna overdraft him because. No one else wants him
The Cowboys should draft Sanders. Getting Sanders in the 4th is a steal. You can always trade up for a rb.
This is literally why I unsubscribed. Rich is such a shill for the Sanders family. Wouldn’t run the 40, told teams he didn’t like that he wasn’t  a fit, refused the combine, refused the senior bowl, was horrible in meetings. All the red flags are there.
Klatt is on point with his analysis
Even the Cowboys didn't want him
The narrative that Rich brought up. the league is punishing the Sanders family. can''t see it otherwise, personally.
Shout out to Rich!!
Love hearing Eisen cry like a little biaych.😊
Shedeur might get the last laugh.
Rich carrying some water for the Sanders family
They're punishing Dion for talking about the owners and  their families this is live humiliation fucking crazy
People are gonna start pulling hamstrings stretching this hard for Shadeur. I love how the media keeps trying to tell us he’s elite when if he watched him play in college at all, he is a mid to average quarterback at best.
I don’t see the talent - also real quarterbacks have completely different personalities than what Shadeur puts out in the public
These SOB’s always find a way to move the goal post!!!
Blacks aren’t good qbs. Too selfish
LUCKILY! I DO think he’ll get picked up before the end of the draft. There’s 4 rounds remaining, he absolutely WILL get a call, BUT, this does teach a lesson (albeit a really shitty one). You’re a black man in America brother. You clearly can play the game… but you have to be able to “sell yourself” to these bums. No one cares how well you play the game if you can’t *checks notes* conversate well. It’s dumb af, cuz at the end of the day, sports is still a game, and there’s no reason the interviews should be that big of a deal, but it is so you gotta say the right things.  Good luck brother! Don’t lose hope.
It’s crazy to watch the media twist themselves into pretzels to defend Deion and Shadeur.   They can’t wrap their heads around people not liking the arrogance and drama that come with that family.
Sanders getting unfair treatment, shame on my Saints
I didn’t expect 1st round but we’re onto round 4, it’s getting a little ridiculous.
This right here is the perfect example of " jealousy of the father, being dispel on the kid".
I'm SO GLAD
“Beg”?! Nah bruh 😅
One question would shauder sander would have been a 4 year starter in a major college without his father been the head coach
Shilos getting drafted 1st
Awful analysis Rich
The NFL spoke silently, the teams don't want the persona of Shadeur, they don't like what follows him, he is being blackballed and he should have been picked already, God speed to the Sanders family hope his name is called on Saturday
This is worse than Bo Callahans slipping in the first round 😅
Who doesn’t remember Deion Sanders saying that he would not let his son play for certain teams? Come on man it doesn’t work that way.
The only elite trait Sheduer has is his mouth
No idea about Shedeur Sanders...but who would want another Lamar Ball always complaining about how "my boy" is being treated by whatever team drafts him??
Mel Kiper calling Shedouchie not getting picked yet "disgusting" is hilarious to me...poor sanders mehhhhhhhhhh
Shedeur wore a gaudy chain with a massive $ symbol on draft night 1. All the GMs saw that. That kid needed humbled badly
I think it is about time for Dallas to pick him... that makes the most sense to me at this point... if he can just grind and learn from Dak, give Dak 2 more years of not making a play when it really counts.
F word yal. Sheduer do what u been doing don’t let them change or “humble” you for doing what you do, it ain’t wrong illegal or wrong, it’s inspirational to others. They draft you, ok, they don’t, ok. We know what it is. They tryna humble u black man, don’t fold! I’m liking this narrative n coverage. This play back in his career gone be raw as H word on a Netflix doc 😂😂😂
Bo Callahan in real life
I didn’t have an opinion going into draft day, but there are clearly problems with release time, taking sacks, mechanics, perhaps the interview, etc. I feel bad for him because he must have been given terrible advice and assessments over the past few months. Whatever happened, it needs to be a case study for other players.
Rich seems awfully upset over Sanders not being picked yet. Almost like he has some skin in the game.
No idea why he's being black balled but you definitely can't have a custom draft room and have gratitude - influences that sort of work against each other.
Travis was Colorado's only first round draft pick everybody else was just somebody you can pick up whenever you want to if you want to and overhyped
Rich, I can tell you have a personal relationship with the Sanders family and are trying to protect Shedeur's image. I wasn't shocked when he didn't go on day 1, but not going on day 2 is wild. I respect your commentary about this topic, and I am excited to tune in on day 3.
This man in the burgundy suit jacket needs to stop, it don’t got nothing to do wit his play or attitude. The NFL is buck breaking that young man .
Everybody’s playing dumb
I believe it may be something more than his QB ability regarding Shedeur.
eisen is such a tool
No one wants locker room cancer.  (Father plus son).  The best part of this is the indictment of the ESPN hype machine.
Everybody used this kid all the YouTube's all the pundits all the sports analysts use this kid as media bait and everybody bit
"Sell yourself", "humble yourself", "BEG", are the phrases and terms heavily used by Joel Klatt and the other NFL Network draft guy. When the powers that be really want to make an example out of you, they do it for everybody to see unapologetically. All of this for an opportunity to play football is crazy work.
I think leadership knows that drafting Shadeur puts a coach straight on the hot seat. If the coach makes a mistake, the fans might start chanting to hire Primetime as the new coach. He’s said he would only want to coach in the NFL if he could coach his kid.
Bla bla nobody cares
Be “humble” bro I hate when people try to sugar coat what they really want to say. Quit trying to play both sides. The hate always comes through I tell you
Maybe he's just not that good. Maybe he's just a backup.  Maybe Mason Rudolph had better stats his sr year and was a 3rd pick and perennial backup (hint he is/was).
NFL is trash
I love the conspiracy theory angle, LMAO. On the whole I’m finding all this quite entertaining.
The kid talks in parables like he’s a God. Nobody “rejecting him”
If you're bringing race into this, you've lost the plot.
He was like you need me more than I need you. Now pay 💰 me😂😂😂😂😂
God has his hands on the Entire Sander’s Family. Regardless, the boys will be just fine! These ppl are being vindictive and it has nothing to do wit th their talent and everything they do with them trying to diminish their brand!  You can’t stop what God has ordained. Shilo and Shedeur have nothing to worry abt. Neither of them need the league. The league is in desperate need of them!
The NFL is petty and clickish. Is he worse than Johnny Manziel?
I believe the NFL is turned off by three things:  1. Shedeur has never played for anyone but his dad.  2. Too many red flags with Dieon deciding who his son WILL NOT be playing for. 3. The NFL collectively are haters of Dieon's sense of entitlement (they really don't like that) So, unfortunately Sheduer has to pay.
Rich why you acting so upset over this? Are you afraid on having his daddy mad or you or what??  this should be a lesson to future players to go to the Combine.............. also to be humble and contrite when going to interviews.  I am hopeful no one drafts him  with his self proclaimed " legendary" BS  it is  legendary that he can't even get drafted  even with all of ESPN and NFL NETWORK  throwing tantrums that he hasn't been and saying how much of a travisty it is.
I wish they would put REAL people on TV . Yall not being honest . Yall are for the NFL not the players smh
Rich is really grasping at straws up here. Its embarrassing
This is Deion's fault, not Shedeurs.
We love you Rich ♥️
Colin Kaepernick without the kneel 🤬✊
The kid is too boastful and think he's some gift from his magical 'god' imagination. His presence on a team will be a distraction in very offensive ways. This was the result of Tebow. He was preaching his hate cult and condemning team mates to hell.
Any red flags about gang activity? Domestic violence? DUIs?
The 2 league puppies are trying really hard to make a case for it making sense. Rich and the black dude smell the BS, you can see it in their face.
Black hard worker don't ever beg
Sanders arrogance and attitude to be a real NFL quarterback is questionable
The Jets are gonna draft him, they love snatching the headlines
I mean, first of all there is a very LONG list of nepo NFL babies who played great in college but ended up being useless in the NFL, more often than not actually. so thats already a bad start, then this kid AND his daddy are putting conditions for teams to draft him, on top of skipping the combine??.... how is anyone surprised about this? No one wants to walk into another Antonio Brown situation, he is proof that not all the talent in the world is worth having a diva on your team. I agree this is a bit extreme, but he certainly dug the hole himself
Eisen always has the Sanders back, and he sees through the Bullshiit
He will get picked. Probably today.
The double standards are crazy. They talk about the social media factor, yet so many players have full on podcasts. People take on trouble qbs so often with higher picks. This is just the league trying pushing back on the sanders name. I don’t know what else it would be.
He lost his mind, saying, "beg of you."
One Sanders is enough ... but Cheddarodor Sanders comes attached with one of the biggest ego maniac to ever grace North American professional sports, DEIon Sanders.
NFL IS A JOKE. DRAFTING A PLAYER IS NOT ABOUT SKILL WE SEE. ITS DEFINITELY PERSONAL AGAINST THE SANDERS FAMILY. SAD STORY.
Maybe he's not as great as you think. Second, he has to be a great fit. Third, they have learned and they're not wasting picks.
Hey Rich if it's because of Deion then the Cowboys would have taken him. Who exactly has Deion coached up that has been elite in the NFL?! Lol. Hunter wasone of the top 3 ranked HS kids coming into college.
At some point in life,  EVERYBODY gets served a piece of humble pie ;  Prime and Shedeur are being force fed a WHOLE PIE. How they react going forward will ultimately define...or alter...their legacy.
Absolutely this is sending the Sanders family a message.
Lol it is personal! The NFL kept Deshaun Watson, Antonio Brown
🙏🙏Blessings forever  beautiful GOD loves y'all too forever tell everyone you know and don't know. Jesus loves y'all too forever. Teach everyone how to see and enjoy their blessings too forever😊❤❤
Im not surprised "Certain" people think that him not being drafted up to this point is OK they share the same ancestors😂💯
Vontae Mack no matter what
So Shedeur should humble himself he's a good kid
It's good to see that teams aren't falling for the self promotion of the Sanders' family. The only way anyone will remember this guy is due to his highly overrated father, and because they told you he should be drafted high but wasn't. His play will be completely forgettable.
When did Shedeur become Colin Kaepernick?
The light blue suit and burgundy suit hit the nail on the head.
They say they don’t think it’s personal, but what if he goes undrafted does that change your mind?
It makes sense that teams wouldn't want the back up QB to be a story. Look at the Tim Tebow circus, and that's all positive news and coverage.
The part that bothers me is these teams rather take players with sexual assault cases over Sanders. It makes ZERO sense besides this is an attack on Prime
Wherever he goes. The QB1 will get hurt and Shedeur steps in. Not hard to see the play here. This whole thing was for NFL marketing and wanting people to be tuned into the draft all 3 days.
Stand your ground young sanders don’t beg them let the chips fall where they may
Love it dont u
What about all the teams his dad said hes NOT going to play for? Are they big meanies for not taking him? Other teams saw that too from a QB who would have been #7 last year. Why are people acting like that happens all the time?
Every conversation in your life is a job interview, whether you know it or not. You're painting a narrative that gets shared in many different ways. Some people think they can turn on the charm or demonstrate good character for the people who matter and snub those who don't. Most of us figure out who you really are very quickly.
The NFL made it more of a story for not drafting Sanders.
Thank you Rich Eisen for speaking the truth when no one else was willing.
I love Rich, but he’s majorly biased on this one. Having worked with Deion so long - they’re good friends and so he has to have a personal relationship with his kids. So of course he’s upset over this, but Joel has no dog in the fight and what he says is true. Teams do not want the headache of having a spotlight on their backup QB.   Everyone is assuming Sheduer is going to be a HOF QB - everyone but the front offices of every NFL team - but what if he just isn’t good enough? There have been countless guys who were great in college but were quickly forgotten in the NFL. Heisman winners have disappeared quickly. So this is nothing new, yet because of who it is and who his dad is - it’s a national story of disrespect 🤦‍♂️.   Time will tell who is right…
Goes to show talking heads don't know SHAT!
Everyone up there is missing the point. The talent, or lack there of, is the problem. He didn't have any elite traits that make up for the circus he brings along with him. I don't think he's better than Jordan Travis and he was a 4th round pick because of his injury. Shadeur feels like a 4th-5th round pick. That's been my opinion since last June
I bet Ewers is drafted before Sanders, happens when your a player with an over bearing father and a player who doesn't realize there is no "I" in team, teams have learned their lesson after the joke Manziel ended up being.
Will Shedeur get picked Saturday?  Now the bargain hunters come out.
Thank you Rich for speaking the truth. Don't even like Colorado or Sanders . Straight bull him not being drafted.
Ain’t no party like a Shedeur watch party because a Shedeur watch party don’t stop!
A Top player on all draft board. Doesn’t smell right. Smh you can tell it’s personal/jealousy and hate by the comment section and media. No DUI, sexual assault, poor academics, lawsuits, jail etc. but ppl mad because he flexing a watch and is confident . Ridiculous.
Sheduer dont beg these devils for nothing. They are burning their house down with their own actions...
None of these teams want Prime Time looking over their shoulder and calling them out publicly when his son doesn’t perform.
So, very obvious here. What did he do that teams found out about that is so bad that they don’t want the firestorm when whoever has it hits “send” on the tweet the second he’s drafted?  Teams will drafts r*pists and murderers and wife and child beaters, if it’s QB and they think he can play AT ALL. At worst he’s a 2nd round grade talent. So whatever it is, is baaaaaaadd.
Would you hire someone like shedur? Would you bet your job on him?
Humbling and genuflecting are not the same.  Genuflection is being asked and he shouldn’t.  Turn on the tape.  Am I good or not?  It’s up to you if you want to waste draft capital on QBs that aren’t good.  I’ll go light up the UFL to show it’s personal and not professional
When the Steelers passed in the bottom of the 3rd we all knew this guy isn't going to be anywhere near a starter now.
It's Deion 100% of why Shedeur wasn't drafted.  No one wants all that drama, especial IF he did go first round.  He'd be insufferable.
He's like maybe fifth best in a bad qb class. Good 4th round flier but that's it. Developmental prospect propped up by Travis Hunter
No franchise wants a QB where all he talks about is money and  rap songs. Maturity is a must at that position.
lol….. get some humble pie 😂
Life teaches you many lessons if you’re willing to learn. EVERYONE gets humbled at one point or another.
It’s not about Shadoor’s performance. IT’S ALL ABOUT ATTITUDE. And he has a cocky loud mouthed attitude that teams don’t want. And it’s their right not to want that toxicity in the locker room
This is a personal  blatant  attack and character assassination move on behalf of the NFL total 🐄  💩 !!!!
Beg for yo job BOY!!!!! Smh.
Here for the “ohhh… they want the black man to beg massa for a job!” Comments 😂😂
The Jags might draft Shedeur.   It would be great value, but they'll need to manage things with wisdom, or a circus would happen around Lawrence
Eisen wake up...teams will take chances on players with elite skill and shady character.  Sanders is elite at nothing...arm strength,  speed, size etc...he's average skill set at best.
One of these teams, probably Cleveland, is going to spill the beans on what's gone down. By talent alone, there is no explanation for selecting Dillon Gabriel over Shadeur. So something has gone down behind the curtain that we don't know yet. My bet is that Deion told the Browns months ago that they weren't welcome to draft Shadeur.
S. Sanders  is overrated he's not that great just watch you will see
Is it a big brain move to go undrafted and sign whereever you want.
Sheduer shouldn't have to call teams to sell himself the man is a goof quarterback not the best but Very good unfortunately this has everything to do with Deon nit Sheduer!!
@10:52 so what  your saying is he has to grovel to be drafted ?
That’s some serious tension between Klatt and Eisen
Rich is way too close to Deion to be   impartial. Just listen to him talk. He sounds like he's hurt that the Sanders kid didn't get drafted.
Maybe - Maybe this is not meant to be.  Thanking God and Listening to God:  ✌️
You guys want him to beg?
I read that in Sanders interviews he never took blame for any sacks, interceptions, that it was always someone else’s fault.  Also that he indicated he wanted a certain game plan?  If that is true then maybe the teams are trying to show him?? Side note I drafted him end of 1st on my MD 25 Cardinals franchise!
I figured a chance for him to drop out of the 1st round… but this is kinda crazy he’s this far down now… he’s still gonna get drafted and that would be his chance to speak with his work ethic and prove everyone wrong
I hear from these comments that Sanders has to be “broken.” That’s quite the whistle historically.
It’s pure and simple, it’s not his play on the field, it’s not his talent as a QB, it’s his character and how he acted in interviews that sunk him. Oh and having Lavar Ball 2.0 as a father doesn’t help either. 👌🙄
Hearing the conversation knowing the Browns and Watson 😂
He was never a first round talent. Even Cam shouldnt have been #1 but its a QB needy league. He was a 4-7 rnd talent. He is a pick below Milroe and Gabriel so it's still playing like it was supposed to. Colorado was 9-4 last year and 4-8 the previous. He has average to good skills. Last year 37 TDs (which is great) but 10 INTs which is not, 4K yards (which is great) but he is the Big 12, which just doesnt have power houses. I think the scouts hyped him up too much and made a story out of nothing.
None of these clowns are owners or a head coach, yet they feel they have authority to tell them who to pick. Show us the interviews. Many QB's crush it in college yet can't do anything in NFL. Perhaps they feel this is one of those picks
I don’t blame Deion for not wanting him to go to some of this dumpster fire of teams. There is no way this kid shouldn’t have been drafted yet. This kid can play.
It makes me wonder if Deion is the deterrent. He already said that there are certain teams that he didn't want his sons playing for.  I don't pretend to know anything im just wondering. He fell for a reason
He lost me when he said tell them i beg of you aw hell naw
Thank you Rich for your honesty
Shedeur  should  not apologize  for being himself.
Hubris! Pride comes before the fall. A tale as old as time.
Deon and his family have always been treated unfairly by the NFL and the TV media. 😉
Couldn't it be that he's just not that good?
Rich just resolved the dilemma...Travis Hunter was the actual talent on the team and that's why he got drafted. Sanders is a good to great COLLEGE player but doesn't have the skills to lead an NFL team. It's a tough reality but maybe it's just that simple.
Who wants all that drama with him and his dad good
The Colts should have taken Sanders, Richardson and Jones are not the answer.
The hate is real
This league never turns down talent???? He needs to go back and research the history of the black quarterback.
Deion said he can’t go to certain team
Dion is probably begging Tom Brady behind the scenes right now to draft him.
Teams were told by the Sanders family they won't let their son play for their organization.  That is entitlement at the highest order.
His father told him to know his worth.
Nah , we not begging. Deff need another approach. Begging is OUT .
Like Nico he is not bigger than the University
Shiteur.....UDFA to Green Bay.
He really just said he wants this young black kid to get on the phone & beg these owners & GM's for a job!!!...WTF!!!!!!!!!!!
Well, this is how the Colorado kids that were kicked out when Dieon arrived in Boulder felt.
Everyone asking how the Shadeur matter got here, look around at everyone asking how the Shadeur matter got here.  Unless a player is a surefire generational talent, the last thing any organization wants is an entourage ready to second-guess their training and development methods.  Their revenue depends on the product they put on the field, and if that product has to answer to a high profile dad, and all of social media, and there is no indication that the player will keep those voices in check, they'd rather not take on the task.
Let's just be real America what America likes are young talented black athletes that have to rise up with single mothers fathers in the penitentiary and they make it out through the NBA are NFL Deion Sanders has been there as a father and the Goat player that he was they can't stand it
I got it Diddy parties?
I am confused, why would a parent give his male son a name that starts with a "she" "She"deur..
Then how come I saw this? The problem with the networks is they have so much access it starts to cloud their opinions. "I might lose access to this person or organization if I say this"
You can't say the league is "talent over everything" when Colin Kaepernick never got another gig.  That remains proof that NFL owners have that one thing they have historically and currently ranked above talent.
Wtf beg for what
......."I'm gonna push back".... No, why don't you shut tf up till Rich finishes hi point.
I graded his on thr field play as Ty Detmer.  Then was mocked  He's got a weak arm, takes sacks and has a terrible attitude
Picture them making him go undrafted he might have to take them jewelry back his money going be funny fasho
No GM wants the Sanders circus on their team!
No one wants another “Johnny Football” on their team 🤷🏼‍♂️
Rich Eisen is the only one willing to speak the truth. These other jokers are a disappointment.
Boy don't call none of those teams
His Fathers ego caught up with his son
Funny how media makes excuses for why Sanders didn't get drafted yet and how he is still better then the players picked ahead of him.
7:48 quiet & humble… see… the truth comes out… admit you want to see him “humbled”… I’ve heard this narrative before… MANY TIMES… it’s nothing new‼️💯
If ur team can win 5 games....there's no excuse for not picking this kid up
Rich Eisen 💯💯💯💯
Rich is great, but he was wrong in the start of this video.
The scorpion always bites the frog....in the fable......no matter when and where he goes.......there's going to be drama.
No one wants the baggage of Deion. he'll show up every practice and annoy them
Dallas didn’t even draft him.
No coach wants him because if he fails after 1 season, the team would fire the coach and hire Deon. I wish my commanders would draft him, put him on the bench and once Deon gets hired as a head coach somewhere next year, trade sheduer to Deon’s teams for their multiple picks
Teams don’t want to deal with Deion
Quarterback is the one position where personality counts for a lot. Because if a quarterback goes around running his mouth or generally putting himself first, then it will throw the locker room into disarray and the team will never come together.
NFL teams want to win and make money before anything else, right? If a team thought he’d help them do that, he’d already be drafted. This is so satisfying to watch unfold. Almost feel bad for him bc it’s all his Daddy’s fault.
Rich don't use the race card
They are trying to break his character.
Rich seems incapable of coming to the obvious conclusion when he's wondering why Deion's 'influence' didn't hold Travis Hunter back...yeah, Hunter is a generational talent, Shadeur isn't. There is no way that a single team had a top 10 grade on Sanders; simply no way, because those players get the benefit of every doubt, and every foible gets overlooked.
He is not a good QB! No one would pass on a good QB. College was his ceiling. Plus LaVar Ball effect.
He telling sheduir to call and beg for a spot. Wow. This is amazing
Rich is such a simp
No team wants a QB and his dad.
Key note "We are trying to explain something we have no answers to per the one commentator".
Funny how teams can’t pick who they want without being criticized, obviously they think the picks they make are the best for their team
The NFL should be embarrassed!
Trump endorsed Shadeur, and that was the end of that.😅
Cowboys
When Archie Manning did it for Eli it was ok but because Deion do it for his sons now it’s a problem
All tht big mansion crap SS all tht stunting
Not surprised by klatt's take. It tracks
I'm not begging no one!
3:33 QB is different… lol… stop.
Klatt basically blaming sheduir.  Its his attitude huh? People like klatt why this stuff happens
You make your bed; you get to lay in it. FAFO.
Shows spending time on other kids spotlight to talk about Sanders was so sad Especially espn, Gabriel gotta spend his draft day highlights hearing about another player when he finished top 4 in heisman
His own mouth caused this. Stop acting like he's a victim some how. This should be a learning moment for him.
He going to have to do something hes never done before.....work for it.
Dude is about to play for the UFL or CFL lol
Legendary can’t be humbled. He’s surrounded by yes men that won’t dare check his ego. With that being said, talent wise, he’s a late second round pick imo.
Beg...😂 what a joke. YOUR NOT GOOD ENOUGH! 💯 YOU THREW TO THE HEISMAN WINNER.  GET OVER IT MEDIA, YOU SOUND LIKE MSNBC. 😅
I'm from Colorado and CU won the games they were supposed to. Not Travis or Sanders are clutch players that raise the team up to play and beat high caliber teams. I say same about Jentry weak competition. Travis "Yes" you get 2 average players for the price of one. If that is value for Jax. they got 2 for the price of one. But is he the best WR or CB in draft ? Heck no! It has been funny watching Mel Kiper freak out as he did when Trent Dilfer a soso QB at best (game manager) was not taken where he thought he should have been picked. And he exploded on national TV. Yes Dilfer was QB of a winning SB team wis stats were a paltry 12 of 25 passes for 153 yards and one touchdown. Now we have to listen to his son and all of his wisdom. It is fun to watch them both meltdown!!
I fucks with rich eisen
I respect Rich Eisen for standing up for Shadeur Sanders and all the other sports commentators.
Rich is wrong and simping for Sanders.  The last thing a HC wants is a HOF dad on camera all season calling out the HC for not playing his son. Shedeur Sander has the attitude of his dad, but not the talent.
Deion;  "my son and i will decide which team we will play for!"
Nobody wants to draft Deion.
Rich is a stand up guy.
In other words he needs to tell massa he be good from now on and never run away or try to influence the other slaves. It's sad to have to do this.  Take your NIL money find something else to do and save your body and brain and eave them all talking. Cause the only way he getting into the league is if he beg and demean himself or he is picked 102 which means his value will be so low he will become a scout team player and be used up until his body break.  He isn't gong to make any money in the league after the third round.  He would literally need s LeBron length career in order to finally accumulate enough money to say he was paid.
SHADEUR IS AN AVERAGE NFL TALENT WITH “ELITE” NFL BAGGAGE… those two do not mix well
No one wants to deal with an arrogant, entitled, disrespectful child. Didn't Sanders not attend the combine? Did he not attend the pro day? Didn't he turn off his phone while in an interview?...and then take a call while in the interview? Didn't he tell everyone that if they didn't want changes made then don't draft him? Be careful of what you say! Then after his overblown ego bolstered by media heads gets blown away because no one wants him, now you also have to deal with his overbearing father, talented or not. Prime is looking to find a back door thru his son to become a GM let alone a team owner. If you are the employer, do you want to deal with these egos and entitled possible employees? I know if wouldn't hire them no matter what else they bring to the table. Move along boys. There's plenty of talent out there deserving a contract.
He’s getting kaepernicked!
I think if he was anyone else he would have went 1st round or early second. No coach wants a legend dad criticizing them or coming for their job. Only a handful of coaching could withstand it and none of them want the clown show.
Rich, you smug idiot, this kid was turning down visits with teams, simply because he didn't think they were a good fit for him! Are you kidding me? Oh woe is me, poor rich famous football player? Get out of here. This dude thought he was better than he is, it happens every year. No one is going to sing your praise over you carrying Deon Sanders  water. The draft isn't about him, or his son, it's about the teams, the players that get drafted, and the fans. Way to cut the legs out from every kid that got his ticket punched.
“I beg of you” FOH with that.   WTF calls and begs
He didn’t get drafted because of his attitude. Period.
Yea 32 NFL teams care more about disliking the Sanders family vs building a winning team. Hmm why’d those teams bring him in for visits then? It isn’t his daddy’s fault he’s a spoiled brat. He sounds like a dumbass when he speaks, and guess now all those terrible interviews make sense. He’s not that good. Plain, and simple.
This is personal.
Thank you rich for giving an honest take Joe you sound stupid you know they trying to punish Deion thru his son Tebow baker mayfield had was a distraction for better for worse
If Shedeur is a backup qb then Milroe and Shough are practice squad QBs. You cannot tell me they are better passers at this stage than Shedeur
Rich having a meltdown. It’s not that complicated.
The talent evaluators figured out hype far exceeded ability he will be as a pro. Also last year’s draft was a BIG QB draft which means the teams that wanted a young QB already have one. The young QB need is very small this year.
Travis hunter isn't a cocky, a-hole and way more talented.
I think Deion told Cleveland that Travis Hunter was not going to play if he's drafted there and now the NFL not messing with shaduer because of it. Because why would Cleveland trade out of that spot where they could of had the best player in the draft in Travis hunter. Doesn't make sense.
rich defending his friends kid i get it but cmon rich let’s be real
Ewers will be the best QB in this whole draft a combo of Matt Stanford and Brees
TALK TO EM RICH
Nooooooooooo. SIRRRRRRRRR? BEG FOR SOMETHING THEY WILL NOT GIVE HIM
It's been widely reported that Shadeur has a good relationship with Brady - texting for advice etc. And Brady has significant influence in LV, where they definitely could justify a 2nd or 3rd-round pick at QB. Yet, they passed. Something about Shadeur is a concern for teams and it will come out.
The fact we are talking about Sanders the entire draft after all stats point he is a mid QB is exactly why he wasn’t drafted
these pundits already treating shedeur like he's some elite QB and never played a snap in the NFL.  get real guys, there is no reason he should be getting all this attention from you.
Everyone is talking about what Deion said where he would not let his son play for. Nobody was talking like this when the Manning's did it with Eli SMH.
Are people upset that he hasn't been drafted yet because of his playing abilities? How great he is. Or isn't because of who his dad is.?
Now they created a martyr
If he was a great QB, he would have been drafted already
Main guy talking never worked in the league.
he ass'd out 😂
His dad got him all the way here, now it is costing him everything. Great to see. I hope he goes undeafted. Turns out Shedur is as shitty as a player as Deion is a person
I applaud Rich for how he stood up for Deion and this family. I'm sure he had to choose his words wisely but they worked together for a long time and are probably friends.
Coaches don’t want to get replaced by Deion
If prime time wasn’t his dad.  Nobody would be talking about this guy
You want a humble leader of MEN at QB in the Pros. Everything he is NOT. His Ego is in the dumpster.
This is f****** personal that's a damn shame
Primes leaving CU and gunna coach the cowboys while starting sheduer at qb. He wont let his son be a backup in year 2. Lol
Travis 1000000x more humble than Deions kids
Talent isn’t everything. Your character, ability to sell yourself, and maturity play a huge part. This is a team sport not an individual sport. Hope Shadeur has learned a lesson
Tom Brady is a minority shareholder with the Raiders who is not only involved with football decisions, but a friend and mentor to Sanders. He is as familiar with how to manage players as anyone and few in the game are respected more. Geno Smith is 34. Would this not have been a great place for him? Why was he not taken? You can be your unapologetic self as much as you want,  it's your right and it's my right to not have to deal with that. See, the problem is this: it's not only managing him in the media, but now his dad, who is perhaps the biggest personality that game has ever seen, will be in the media, second-guessing everything. Is the juice worth the squeeze?
Look, Mike Tomlin, the most player-friendly and tolerant coach in the league, who no doubt has some reasonably solid relationship with Deion and who NEEDS a QB, passed over Shadeur at 83 for goodness sakes. Something about this player turned people off, and it will come out soon.
Poor Rich, his angst is laughable
Used to be a fan of Eisen.  Turned into a liberal clown.  Shedeur is a thug, no team wants that drama
Sanders ARENT ROYALITY😅😅😅😅😅 THEY AREJUST BLACK😅😅😅😅😅
I’m going to guess this isn’t a Shedeur problem, it’s a Deion problem.
So he needs to beg, foh
a lot of the times executives draft someone, it is typically a reach. you see it all the time. and it fails. when questionable character or attributes come into play, and they question you mentally as a person..... those execs are usually right. maybe some of the years prior like 2021 as an example has teams scared to reach especially if the player didnt interview well.
Remember Draft Day?
IMHO many teams may not want to draft Shadeur because it will bring in drama. They would have to deal with two narcissists instead of just one.   Shadeur and his dad.
Odel bechams dad on social media criticism of baker and coaching staff is why nobody wants shaduer
Breaking news: Nepo baby doesn’t get special treatment.
They didn’t do all of this over the Mannings getting involved in Eli’s career. This is about humbling that family. Why is “entitlement” acceptable in one situation and absurd in the other?
If he’s available in round 7 the Cowboys will take him.
Nfl teams want the player and not the brand.
Cause all the Portal Pound puppies are good citizens....😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅NO MORE exCUses
I preface this by saying I am a huge Deion Sanders fan, and I believe that Shedeur is an above-average quarterback. There have been many comparisons with Eli Manning not wanting to go to the Chargers and John Elway not wanting to go to a team. The big difference is that these players and their representatives spoke up at that moment. The issue with Sanders is that it is a nonstop circus. No one wants to have a player who brings that much baggage.
I can't stop watching that drone show
Maybe teams don’t think he’s as good as the pundits who went for team Sanders hype. Maybe he makes teams regret it or maybe he’s a career backup. I’m beginning to think this isn’t the NFL draft as much as a reality show named Where  will Shedur go?
Taking a pay cut to get into the NFL is legendary
It did the same thing with Bill belichick and they did the same thing with Lamar Jackson when he was in free agency. The NFL colludes there's no way of denying that. They decided as an organization we're not going to draft the guy
Retired the kids jersey doesn't even get drafted in the first three rounds. Cam Ward went first. Tomlin had a chance Steelers needed a qb. So we know it's not racism because all 32 teams had a chance
Shedur wasn't that gteat in college
I think he should’ve gone by now, but he was overrated, came w the wrong attitude, and his support system and fanbase are a lot to deal with. I keep seeing people make this a race/jealousy thing. No. It’s simply what I said above. Now I think he should’ve gone by now, but I can see why not
Shadeur will be a solid quarterback. I believe he’s the 2nd best quarterback right now. Potential wise I think Milroe in today’s style could be better. But there’s no doubt in my mind as I post this shadeur is 2 and should’ve been draft by the end of round 1.
There is a reason why teams don't just draft based on film. They interview to get an idea of what the player is all about. I think that was his problem. When word got out that a coach had a negative statement, his dad called the head coach of the team. What??? Then his dad said, and you could look it up, "I ran the interview, and he didn't say anything that was arrogant." His dad was running the interview????? We are probably starting to see the issue. No senior bowl, no NFL combine. Sounds like his dad created the issues.
Eisen is spot on.
His doest have that talent that nfl teams want. Stop gaslighting and making ppl think hes good when hes not!!! Stop blaming teams and not sanders.
Sanders problem is his dad. No one wants to deal with Dion.
There's no way this wasn't a collaborative effort by the owners, Kaepernic warned us about the *"Good Ole Boys"* who black balled him years ago. Which is why I don't watch NFL games.
His NFL pre draft interview was a disaster.  His dad did him no favors except for his name. His bankruptcy and prior assault case?
TALENT TALENT TALENT….PERIOD. That’s what you draft on.  Conversations on PR and exposer. Is later.
Shedeur Sanders is a smaller slower Deshaun Watson. Same diva attitude.
Poor poor sanders.    Turtle up and go away🤣
Rich is acting legitimately butt hurt
I swear NFL people are so stupid.  The reason no one is drafting Shedeur is because whoever is the coach will always feel the pressure of Deion and taking over the head coaching job there if there is any bit of disagreement on how he's playing his son or not winning the superbowl.  So all the NFL coaches know they are just waiting for Deion to just take over if things do not go right.  Not a single NFL analyst can think of this?
The media can’t figure out why cuz they can’t admit all of it comes from his tape and on the field instead of personal vendettas.
Ain’t it a distraction not to draft him. Everyone will be asking why??
Draftibg Dillion Gabriel  is reason why the Browns will remain in the toliet
It’s his attitude and coach ability.
this late in the draft all the teams in the market for a QB have probably already drafted one.  he might go undrafted.  NFL teams know what they are doing.  the've all said we dont want him or his daddy bringing a spectacle to their team.  can't say that i blame them.  nobody wants a nepo baby.
Don’t talk about Deions boy ( unless we say it’s alright)
Dieon lack oh humility and narrsacism has followed his son. But his son dont run a 4.2 and at the wrong position. The league has unified to send a message to him and his dad that you dont run nothing this way... The Ball brothers dad was off the charts, but the sons kept quiet.
It sounds like the media is more offended than Shedeur. Eventually he'll get drafted, the later he does the less pressure there will be on him to live up to. League is just humbling him, taking him off pedestal his dad put him on.
So what you are saying is once again, espn and the nfl network produces its own headlines to talk about between the superbowl and the start of the season?  Haven't heard any Arron Rodgers talk this week. Once the draft is over and the newness of the draft prospects dies down, it will be back to Aaron Rodgers.
The cleveland browns had a chance to get sanders  at the end and chose that 5"11 qb . This is the league telling teams to pass on him that's all it is. Because you know d*** well the browns wanted to snag him.
"Perceived Backup"??? NOPE Sheduer has been RELEGATED to a backup   An injured player who's a 1st rd player WITHOUT the injury IS STILL considered a STEAL and a presumed starter  This is obvious language that's missing from guy #2 & #4 from Rich Eisen They're glossing over smudge the league has smeared here  Ppl have their own minds that media cannot control  In 2025,,,the 🌍s consciousness is awakened to gilded slights and insults to our intelligence as ppl  A desk, title or network doesn't dictate truth, no matter the efforts to dictate narratives
I think Charles is right, it's 'personal' now, and I'd say the reason Shadeur has dropped so far is because Deion stiff-armed a lot of teams who he didn't want his kid to end up with. You can do that if you have leverage because you know for sure one of your preferred teams will pick you. But it's now obvious that zero teams had a top 10 grade on Shadeur, so they didn't have the leverage. So, when he drops, the teams who they brushed off aren't interested, and I can't blame them.
Bro who cares you don’t own the team that’s there decision. If they don’t want him than they don’t want him
These guys are jokes except for Rich! Oh, now the NFL and these teams are concerned with him being a possible shithead??!! When we were at UF, EVERYONE knew Aaron Hernandez was a POS!!!!! BS!
It’s a combination of things. 1. He isn’t as good as people in the media were saying he was 2. His attitude clearly sucks, I’m not sure if they’re real but I’ve seen assistant coaches who were in his interviews being quoted as saying he was the worst interview he’s ever seen and that he isn’t that talented 3. This QB draft class is below average and a lot of teams would probably rather wait another year for next years class to draft a QB. It’s like it was said in the interview. Do you really want this kind of baggage with a backup quarterback? Especially when next year you can get the same thing talent wise without any of the previously mentioned problems.
His father said he would not let his kids play for certain teams. He also said he would come to the NFL to coach his sons. I don’t know how much responsibility his father owns but it’s not zero.
Teams and people are sick of the drama and entitled attitudes and it's showing. Have a lil spoonful of humility all those so high n mighty.
You all are asking him to shut up and beg 😢
Deion said he told some teams not to draft his son, presumably he thought they were bad franchises and didn’t want them to draft his son….that clearly makes those teams not want you and when word gets around to the other teams a lot of them won’t want you either
But he shouldn’t be a backup is the problem
Wow…
Beg? Really?
The sanders bring nothing but a name which now should be well played out cause they didn't do jack at colorado no undefeated season no championship didn't even make it to the playoffs give me a break the league is punishing them what the heck have they done oh boohoo if this dude didn't have the sanders name we wouldn't even be talking about this
Racism is real black families!
He's gonna get picked. This is the old story of the establishment. Feeling the need to serve this young brother some humble pie. How many of us have experienced this. If you were confident and had some swag. Its not by accident
Fact is, he's not good enough to overcome the perception that he's got an attitude of entitlement and will act that way at the next level. No team wants to deal with his "advisor" (aka Primetime) being in his ear when they are trying to teach him and coach him, and the possibility of speaking out in the media with criticism if his team is struggling and he's not playing. And no coach wants to be constantly looking over their shoulder for Coach Prime.
There’s always the CFL
Shedeur is currently a system qb at best who teams believe only listens to his dad. I wish him the best when he gets his chance.
Eh. The Steelers signed GP and DK. They are courting Aaron Rodgers. Tomlin signed Antonio Brown. They signed Mike Vick, at QB no less, AFTER a felony conviction and media controversy when he was a former star brought into play backup. Knowing their need, it makes it strange that they’d pass on a QB in the first and third rounds. After all, Tomlin seems to fetishize family legacy players and character challenges that others are afraid of.
There are two types of people, those who have been humbled, and those who are going to be. We all fit in one way or the other.
Boycott the NFL.
Character, family drama is hard to overcome.
The bottom line is Sanders is not good enough to act like he does it simply is not warranted
The “Tush Push” vote owner’s meeting  was really to discuss what to do with Shedeur.
Could it be at all possible that the teams just don’t think he’s that good?
The Las Vegas Raiders will draft Shedeur Sanders. You heard it hear first.
I think certain teams are thinking he's going to drop and are trying to get him at a bargain. A team like the Steelers or Jets, that don't have QB of the future. Also, teams that need a QB might be intentionally holding out for Arch Manning, even though he's not a lock to come out next year.
Lmao they want him to beg is crazy they clearly said they trying to humble him smh
Teams don't want or need the baggage. I feel bad for the kid
SS will enter the NFL as a undrafted free-agent. Tony Romo did, and he has had a prosperous career
S^2 will be the last pick of the draft…
It's the kid's attitude and his toxic Father
I remember when us Broncos fans wanted to keep Tebow as a backup to Manning and the team didn't want the distraction. Teams don't want a media (or social media now) circus.
Shedeur has to be hurting. The NFL teams have made a statement. They don't want him. Tough.
Coach Prime has to take some of the blame. I have no issue with a father holding his son down. But there is such a thing as saying and doing too much. At times, Prime unnecessarily put a target on his sons back. Im not saying he shouldnt protect him, I just wish he did it a little more quietly. If we are being totally honest and taking our love for coach prime out of the equation, people have to admit Coach Prime was a little extra at times. Like broadcasting to the whole world he didnt want his son playing for certain teams. Thats something he could have kept in house. I also believe retiring Sheduers number was the icing on the cake. Sheduer hasn't won anything significant to be worthy of having his jersey retired. It was a slap in the face to other who played at colorado and produced way more than Sheduer.
Eisen is clearly a friend and former coworker of Deion—and it shows. Shedeur’s arrogance was over the top, and this humbling moment might be exactly what he needed. I do feel for him, though. Hopefully he takes the lessons to heart, gets drafted, and works his way toward a Hall of Fame career.
Rich is taking this too personally. Travis is by all account a good person who isn’t very entitled and arrogant.
Sheduer to vikings in round 7. 😂
This occurred because of the Bronny James undeserving pick to the NBA.  The owners are sending a message to all professionals players.  Owners are in charge in the NFL.
I wouldn't say it's personal but aside from being a slightly better than average QB, when things aren't going well what team wants to hear all of the criticism from his dad.  If he was good enough, it wouldn't matter to most teams but he's just not good enough to put up all of the drama, at least not in the early rounds of the draft.
Baltimore draft a player with two SA charges end of story. ❌️🚫👎🏾🤷🏾‍♂️
A franchise QB should be the most humble person in da room. When shed didn't interview well, you know why. You don't want ahole for a QB.
Bro, why you keep talking about Drake Maye? He's trash. Bo Nix and other rookie QB outplayed him let me know when he takes the Patriots to a playoff game
First time in his life he's heard the word "no"
NFL saw the Bowl game against BYU! They saw enough
Well the Rock is gonna love Shadeur starting in the XFL next year
No dude that’s what they want him to do is beg and be humbled
Don’t be humbled my guy. Humble the LEAGUE
Team Sanders brings too much baggage compared to the playoffs.
I don’t get it he couldn’t even win the Big 12 without Texas or Oklahoma and everyone talking about how great he was when Travis Hunter made him look wayyyyyy better than he is!
Shadeur not being drafted is more proof the nfl is rigged
I wish they would stop dancing around the true reason he has not been drafted.
Why does he have to sell himself again and self-reflect…. Yall making special rules for the kid , ik this a tough subject but let’s just be real they don’t fw the sanders family in more ways than one and tryna teach them a so called lesson like Rich Eisen said
Coaches do not want to lose thier jobs to Deion and it's that simple.
Shadeur just doesn’t seem like a serious prospect that GM’s wanna invest a lot of money in. He’s like the guy that shows up in shorts and a tank top to a job interview because he’s “keeping it real” or “secure with himself”. He’s was rapping at his house after he fell out of the first round. He just doesn’t seem like he GAF about making a good impression to teams.
Why do we think these general managers are qualified? Most of them got the job by knowing someone in a great position. They miss on the quarterbacks all the time.
Unfortunately Deion probably hurt his son's process more than anyone. Sad story here.
Humble is the new do what master say term
TOM BRADY, the goat! was drafted in the 6th round and i don't remember the talking heads moaning and whining about that.  Compare their college careers, compare their reactions to not going in the draft on the first night...
There are definitely teams that think "we saw how talented he was during the combine".
No he shouldn’t beg for anything!!! Is this a humbling experience yes but he shouldn’t go beg for anything! But it’s clear as day that the league has a personal vendetta against his family
I hope he gets drafted 199th overall so his entire mini-career is shadowed in embarrassing comparisons.
I believe Jerry Jones will draft Shedeur
Wish athletes would stop bringing "god" into it and actually do some introspective onto why things happen 2:50
Sanders is not that great of a quarterback, people don't understand that!  Rich, you need to slow your roll he was never a number one draft pic!
Nobody wants a new Araon Rogers drama with 1/5 of the talent
To the guy opposite end of Rich  You've already stated that none of you have knowledge of this being a message sent to the Sanders family But  Around the 7:30 minute mark, this same guy says, "...the league has sent Sheduer a message..." quote  That flies in the face of his own statements here, previously  HowE-VER  GR8 point to the African American guy and Rich Eisen close to the end, in that Travis Hunter went 2nd overall -_-_- Same coaching and SAME ear that he will always be advising in Hunter,,, But teams have no concerns if Deion's influence NOR (And this is me, btw)  the already rumors of the kids alleged GF-drama potentially being an issue  So this IS personal over professional BC OF DEION SANDERS  To dismiss this VERY telling fact is asinine   Either you don't know, so stay silent OR Admit it's a message, meaning it is personal
Nope. He doesn't need to beg any of these GMs.
Absolutely NOT!  Do not get on your knees and beg the NFL for a roster spot.  The world has tons of opportunities for an intelligent and gifted young man. 🎉
I get the sense that they strongly believe he’s not getting drafted
My best guess is that the locations looking to prospect for a starting Quarterback are maybe 1-2 years of Shedeur playing and the organization not winning from being in talks with Deion to take over as coaching and remove the existing staff. They know Shedeur comes with back end power they won’t be able to push out the way if success is not presented immediately.
Colorado retired the number of someone who might go undrafted and didn’t win a bowl game…lol
I hired high school students for summer jobs one summer.  The worst ones were the students who had their parent(s) virtually shadowing them the entire tiime.
Rich said forget all that political shif they tryna humiliate the Sanders legacy
The NFL obviously doesn’t want him so why are we still obsessing about him?
Bucky is eating this up.
The NFL teaching the Sanders family a lesson?   Really? WTF.
Shedeur has an bad ego and he brings tons of drama with his dad. He was realistically a 2nd or 3rd round talent, but got overhyped because this is a weak QB class.  Combine the two and it's no surprise he's falling this far.
Why is Rich Eisen so in love with this kid?  Second day where he is going after the world in defense of an average QB. Doesn't seem concerned about the 500 other players who haven't been drafted yet.
Id bet teMs dont want to pick him up because immediately when hes not successful they know fans will be calligraphy for the head coach to be fired and his dad to be hired.
This has to be multiple factors causing this.  Obviously a lot of people do not see the talent as starter quality- even still I can’t imagine QB hungry teams wouldn’t be willing to take a shot especially with pedigree. Distraction as they mentioned- through teams drafted tons of red flag guys and manage just fine.  FO fears- I think something they are ignoring a team drafting Sanders is bad. Bad teams tend to have coaches and GMs on the hot seat. Deion is already a college coach and has had some success could a few teams be avoiding Sheduer out of fear that if they keep failing ownership will just fire them hire Deion because Sheduer is there.
Detroit trading up for TeSlaa was a shock to me. He has ideal measurables but had very limited production. That was a ballsy move
Why does Rich look so emotional. 😂😂
Bottom line is he has baggage, and that baggage is his father!  NO team wants to deal with Deion and his constant diarrhea of the mouth!
You could feel Rich creating a tension which made this whole conversation restricted by the underlying fear of backlash from saying what they really felt about why Shedeur wasn't drafted. Being attacked and having your career ruined for giving an honest opinion has ruined this world and eliminated any chance for learning through genuine discussion. Those that are befuddled by why he wasn't drafted are so because they silence any opinion that doesn't mirror their opinion!
Remember Lamar was a receiver according to most executives
Cleveland had drafted Manzeil, Mayfield, others, and traded for Watson. Then passed 5 times on Sanders. Either they are learning from their mistakes or even the Browns didn’t want to deal with everything attached to him. If Cleveland had drafted him early he would be on another team in two years anyway.
Y'all trippin  Y'all hatin on him because of his daddy! The Sander family knows it. He's already a humble young man.. But it's all good  Cuz God will control the narrative  Peace ✌️ & Blessins'
Reading the comments & everyone opinion about this young man life & his dad on why he hasn't bn picked many of you have bn waiting to take shots at this family for whatever reason but most of you can't even look in the mirror for 20 seconds & say I love myself ask how I know just go back & look at ur comment to Shedeur Sanders I'm pulling for young man God & family 🙏🏈
Yall Hate the Chiefs just say yall do. Be honest..
If you want to be thought of as your dad is.................play like your dad did
😂😂😂
Thank you Rich Eisen for keeping it THE REALEST I've heard of ANY host. THEY MADE HIM A BACK UP QB NOW WITH THIS PICK! WHEREVER HE PGETS PICKED
Sanders is a good QB.  Is he an NFL quarterback?  The intangibles of Sanders on and off the field do bleed over.
99% of commenters NEVER PLAYED COLLEGE FOOTBALL, let alone NFL 😂
This league is "Talent Over Everything?" Tell that to Kaepernick, boys.
Watching rich have a meltdown because his friends kid hasn’t been drafted is hilarious
This is personal. They did the same to Lamar for his extention
Seeing Eisen and Kiper absolutely blow up over Shedeur Sanders is easily the most embarrassing thing of the 2025 Draft.  Deion needs to look at the mirror to see why teams are rejecting his son. Getting his number retired and saying that Shedeur is the greatest thing since sliced bread wasn't the right approach and Deion getting smoked for it.  Good.
Isn't the media and the camera's part of the game .. please stop with this excuse 😒 . And the "humble" excuse, he's humble in the eyes of God, and that's the only knee he has to bow to
Who wants a marginally talented prima Donna who has to show off his rolex every time he comes to the sideline?
Give it up Rich — we don’t want to hear your opinion. Just go ahead and say it you wanna say it racism
He Legendary!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 if he dont get drafted he really be legendary
I'm just glad the kid didn't show up to green room
Every team already has cameras lol
This just in! Behaviors have consequences. That's life in all aspects regardless of the color of your skin. Race has nothing to do with it.
Comedy these guys telling Sanders to beg GMs
The nerve of an arrogant "Black Man" having confidence in himself. He should be jhumble? So sad same ol story. The NFL along with the College organizations re trying to punish Coach Prime and his family period.
The race card is coming soon! 😂
Eisen is clueless
,75% is in play
I hate to break it to you but the NFL has shown if your talented enough they do now care about your character this obviously has to do with his sub par traits and natural talent and then roll it up with the egotistical attitude yea I don't blame teams for staying away from him
Change his last name , and NO ONE would care .
What i heard those two Saxons saying is Shedeur is too outlandish, too confidence and as such, he should be humbled.
Let’s also not forget there are a lot of teams that just don’t need a QB.  Those teams might take a chance with a later pick but would not use an early pick.
The Browns drafted a QB No. 1 caught on tape drunk and running from police.
If Sanders is still available by the sixth round, it would be best for teams like the Bears or the Lions to just take him because they have no back up and their starters are pretty shaky
Teams don’t want to deal with the hype that comes with shedueur. He’s also very cocky for a guy who I wouldn’t consider a “generational talent”. He’s a QB and needs to be able to lead a locker room of pros. While I feel he has potential I just think teams are turned off by his arrogant overly confident altitude. Oh and then there’s Deion Sanders…..
Sooooooo beg....
10 minutes of repeated nothing narrative
You guys need to get a better barber
Talent over everything is the key point they made.
Johnny got a job
BEG?!? That’s exactly what they want!!! Hell nah!!!
Bs it all boils down to race
Too much confidence without humility = arrogance. Too much humility without confidence = insecurity.
Maybe Sanders is a “me guy” and not team first.  At the QB position, can’t have a “me guy.”
Its gotten to the point now that draft is more about sanders and not the young players who worked their tails off to get drafted in the first place this whole draft is a mess
Two things:  1. No team wants the circus, and his talent simply is not worth it at this point in the draft. He's going to be a back-up which is where he should be anyways, at least to start his career.  2. There's probably a couple teams feeling like, maybe we'll just wait until next year's class, which is MUCH deeper.
Deon Sanders mouth is part of the reason his son wasn't drafted.
Thanks for keeping it 💯 Rich Eisen!! The kid didn't deserve this, his talent should of been enough to land him in the first round! He is a pocket passer who will pick defenses apart and also has enough scrambling abilities to keep defenses honest! Opportunity is coming to this young man!
It’s gotta be an agenda at this piint
Nobody would care if his last name was Jones and his dad name was Bill
I'm done with the nfl
SHEDUER BRINGS DIDDY ENERGY
This is my first time watching the NFL Draft and it will be the last time.
Rich goes down on Meion.
It's all politics.
There is too much flash. having cars delivered to Colorado and social media. Cam Ward is humble, not flashy, and a worker
This has nothing to do with what he saying he is a young black man who is confident and capable of playing in the NFL this is personal attack on the sanders family
I think its safe to assume at this point that the rumors about Shedeur's interviews are true and possibly even worse than reported. Yeah, the added baggage of Deion doesn't help his stock, but i don't think thats really a valid argument for this much of a slide, especially when several QB needy teams have either passed on him multiple times at this point or went with another less polished, less experienced QB
Thank you Rich for keeping it 💯💯💯
Eisen acts like it’s his son getting passed over. What a whiner. He understates the locker room impact because he’s media and media doesn’t truly grasp the challenges for coaches and front office staff.   The reality is this… Shedeur has a father that’s never been known for keeping his mouth shut. If he’s sitting there as a backup, how long is it going to be before Deion starts flapping his gums about how his son should be playing? How long is it going to be before the rumor mill of Deion replacing the head coach starts? Not to mention, we’re not exactly talking about people with a history of showing any humility. I don’t think it’s shocking that a GM and a coach may be reluctant to add that potential circus to their team.  Sometimes I think these draft “experts” complain about situations like this because it makes them look bad as much as anything
Soo funny how little these so-called analysts know about the NFL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If I was Shedeur, I would tell the NFL to kiss my a$$ and go to the CFL. He already got money. He just wants to play football.
First time Shedeur was given an unbiased evaluation.  Shoot the messenger since it's less painful than the alternative.  Doing that proves the point...lack of accountability, humility, and self awareness.
Absolutely Rich!
They keep saying how good of a player he is, the NFL obviously doesn't agree just admit you were wrong and move on
They don’t want Deion on the sidelines. Not enough talent to overcome that.
Mjd has really made himself into a very good broadcaster
He wasnt never that good. Just had the camera and headlines alot. He was never gona make it
Did this clown really say, he needs to Beg!!! There’s that, “he needs to be humble” BS. Kendrick Lamar said it best.
Rich ….. do you owe the Sanders family money?   Never saw you not get it so badly….. teams don’t want problematic leaders in their locker rooms, being a great player is just one part of the equation.
Beg for what! a Sanders, begging Nahh. Not happening nor should he.  At this point none of these NFL Teams deserves Sheduer.  It's sounding,smelling like collusion and why do that to a 23yr old that had dreams just like any other kid growing up wanting to play in the NFL.  His Talent speaks for itself. A very confident young man. The Saints fake prank phone call was down right evil.  If Sheduer goes undrafted he's being BLACKBALLED and looks like it has already started. This is definitely Personal. but yet Sheduer is a BIG reason why a Heisman Winner and #2 overall draft pick is in the NFL.  Without Sheduer throwing 12 the ball, timing,accuracy and made him shine, Coach Prime embracing his talent as a "must see" 2-way player, there would no Heisman Winner out of Colorado. Smear campaign at its finest. CMTSU!
Quit acting like he’s owed something, he brings too much baggage and not enough talent
Rich, “Sanders being in Pittsburgh without Farve there is another Kenny Picket situation elevated by 10!”
Rich has to sit up there and cape for Shedeur because he’s so close with his daddy. At this point what Joel is saying IS correct. The reason Shedeur isn’t drafted but guys with red flags are is BECAUSE he’s a quarterback. Comparing the situation surrounding a quarterback to any other player is a false equivalency
Rich goes down on Meion.
Thank You Rich Eisen for speaking up for the Sanders Family……..
One of the puppies looks like Jaxon Dart! 😂😂😂.  WHAT?!
Sorry but this isn’t really a big surprise to a lot of people
Rich can’t be impartial on this topic
The NFL and NCAA should let guys in the draft who aren't taken in the first 3 rounds have the option of going back to school if they have eligibility left. All these kids have representation in college now because of NIL.  I assume Sanders has another year of eligibility left which obviously means nothing now.  But it would be a win for him and Colorado if he were back another year.  It would be great for college football.  Obviously the NFL would be against it because it would thin out the draft pool a bit, but lets face it, a majority of late rounds picks aren't making a career in the NFL.  Just a thought.
Watch the tape. He takes too many sacks and is not very accurate. Hunter bailed him out time and time again.
They answered they own question he is not that good 🤯
No one needs him and his daddy's toxic attitude blowing up smoke just because they're losing some games to have his son at the helm. Ain't no way any organization is going to have any of that.
Interviews come down to your pre mindset
Rich Eisen has the kneepads and chapstick out going hard with his copium.
Somebody needs to state the obvious. What HC would want to draft Sanders knowing that his father will be lobbying to be the HC of his son’s team? Deion is not staying at Colorado beyond this year.
Would be hilarious if he went un-drafted!
Its about his attitude and all his fathers drama..after the first round they trashed Joe Flacco and the Browns ! For what Deion clearly did not what his son or Travis for that matter going to Cleveland so whats he mad about the Browns  not taking them .. Travis had some attitude too where he's going to dictate I "will" play both ways or i wont play I think turned off the Browns Plus the value they got in the trade for what they need but his talent still got him the second overall pick
You think he has enough cojones to tell his Dad to STFU now?…the BALL family in the NBAhad the same loudmouth Dad ..until they got drafted….then he finally moved back into the background…Poppa has t0 back off…and let his son grow up and be his own man….Daddy ain’t gonna be around all the time
Red Coat commentator shut up. This is personal and about the hate against his DAD!
They’re absolutely trying to teach this good black family a lesson!!!
THANK YOU RICH EISEN‼️‼️ The NFL has drafted some of the WORST people in all of sports. But we’re supposed to believe they won’t draft Shedeur Sanders because they think he’s cocky⁉️⁉️⁉️ Are you dumb⁉️⁉️⁉️
Jerry will not let the kid go undrafted. Just think have him sit a year or two behind Dak and then bring in Prime to coach the team. He doesnt even have to ge remotely good, the tickets will sell because Cowboy's fans are morons.
he will be Mr Irrelevant
Don't change for them
Ok now, So, to WHAT other player that has fallen in any draft that this gentleman on the far right end of the desk has given this advise to?  My point being, Why SHOULD a player call GMs and plead his case when, as professionals, they should have already getting and screened out the noise  After all,,, They're more adult than this kid THIS is a direct insult to Deion Sanders praising the raising of his kids  GMs are saying, you didn't raise him well enough to quell our concerns  And for any who feel Deion would be in the way,,,,???,,,!!!, etc,,,  You're not drafting Shedeur's dad
The majority of the players in the NFL are people of color and the race cards are still being pulled 🤦‍♂️
League clearly said he’s not talented enough to put up with his and his dads bullshit antics
Maga owners
Rich is hitting on what we want to hear! True journalism
The glazing is crazy work 😂
Pride came before his fall hahahaha
Talent? The reality is as a college QB he was barely better than .500.
He shows seriousness with footage of him with team mates
Thier verbage sounds like they trianning people not to be confident
He would never have the humility to reach out to a team.. EVER.
Now I understand the definition of ‘gaslighting’ When 18 teams ask for an interview and you only agree to meet with the top 5…it’s not the league against the Sanders Family, but it’s that the teams don’t want to draft EVERYTHING that comes along with drafting Shadeur.
Amerikkka
This is all a non Story. Every QB taken has the film, character, and experience to match or exceed Sanders.   Why hasn’t Will Howard gone? Why did Gabriel go so late? I get he made Colorado better but he didn’t make Colorado good.
The confused pundits baffle me  How do yall not see the blatantly obvious reasons he'll be nothing but a humbled high priority udfa by the end of all this lol
They accidentally retired his 📞 number instead of his jersey number…
I think Rich should take a step back take the emotion out of it and maybe offer the advice Klatt about deep reflection,   I don’t hear anyone saying why hasn’t Quinn Ewers from Texas  been drafted yet ? He played against far more better competition and a championship game and he is still sitting there,   Be humbled and when you do get drafted go earn it,   Probably best thing that could happen to him ,  NFL nothing is guaranteed
BULLJUNJ
Rich, you’re a Pro
Sports is not the only industry where who someone is as a person can be more important than their ability to do the job.
The NFL is RACIST. They don't want more back QBs going to the Super bowl!  Look at all the crap they gave Hurts, Richardson, Colin K.,  Jackson, and remember Doug Williams!  This is Classic 'Buck Breaking' when a Black man is NOT allow to show self confidence, which is celebrated in others!!!  Now all the bigoted 'experts' spending a lot of time justifying why Shedur Sanders was passed up when clearly he was the BEST college Quarter Back as proven by his record.  He came to the NFL Draft as a millionaire!!!  Don't WE have a right to see OUR heroes get deserved opportunities?  This is an attack on Blackness!
Wasn’t he or his dad talking about his there were only certain places he was willing to go?
Beg? 5:59
🐘: if Shedeur went 1-10 in addition to Hunter going two, Boulder would've become an instant pro player factory of the likes that has NEVER been seen... PERIOD!!!
I’d take Shaduer over a few starting QBs right now. Especially Caleb Williams and Dak. Steelers need a young QB. I’m comfortable in saying this is personal. It’s something we don’t know,
Just drop the names for a minute. Undersized qb from a .500 team, with slow release and too many sacks... doesn't do any workouts, combine, or interviews. Shows up to one in PJs and is now pikachu faced? Na
Why does he have to beg to get a chance at something he earned
He’s not a blue chip prospect @ QB. He and his dad act entitled as if he were. Many teams don’t want to deal with the drama that will come with him. Mostly from his dad. Pretty sad, because he has talent.
Beg?!?! Smh
He wont reflect and be humble, too many telling him hes being blackballed
This is deeper anyone who Deion coach will be threatened he's gonna lose players at Colorado. The NFL is going deeper than shedeur, they plan to destroy Deion, anyone Deion coach gonna get scared of going through this too. More players gonna go through the portal now at Colorado and leave Deion. They want his soul
Sports media guys are arrogant know-it-alls,  Coaches and GMs are arrogant know-it-alls, and Deion and his son are arrogant and entitled know-it-alls… This really is some great drama😂
Bro said beg man look at the tape
8:25 Travis won the Heisman and was elite at two positions yet he has handled himself with class and humility. He understood this was a job interview with the opportunity to change his family’s financial future. Sanders is entitled with his dads money and and privilege
Shedeur got a chance to go #1 in the CFL!
You are cowards! You have become supporters of what you know this is! The NFL is a monopoly that needs to be broken up.
The Mannings irked the league the same way the Sanders are doing, but I guess we teach these certain guys a lesson...
Rich, sheudur ain’t gonna let you hit
Crazy  how 1st guy and 3rd brother on the same page. Then you see 2nd and 4th guy on the same dumb page.
There’s a camera at every single draft party, but Shedeur can’t have one at his, and that makes him arrogant somehow?!
4:40 is deep. That's literally the convo you may have to have with your kid or your employee, but if it's with yourself is the hardest. Thanks bro for saying that and I hope Shedeur processes better than I did at that age 😂
When i watched him play in colorado i saw him with a giant gold chain i thought this might cause a problem. I always say dont show off 😮 it had a. $ symbol not a good look .just saying better to be humble and a simple kind of man 😮 let your play on the field do the talking😮
“Whether they want production, size you NEYOVVE it.” 0:54
Too much baggage for what you get…..especially at the most specialized position in the game?
🔥🔥🤔🤔Something klearly is going on private.. 🤔🤔 i Believe Dallas or ATL should draft Shedeur  & allow him his xhanxe.. If he go undrafted.. Fukk that.. Jets or Giants should Bring him in.. As its unBelievable why he is Not Drafted.. Sanders aint a Back up.. He would win that starting joB eventually 😈🔥🔥
How did drafting Deion work out for Atlanta?  He bolted asap to a division rival.  I find it a little rich for Deion to chase superbowls, money, and media attention... and always talking about the Lord.  The Lord, apparently,  always wants to feed Deions ego.
Travis Hunter is just as outspoken as Shedduer but he didn’t have a problem it has nothing to do with talent because other than maybe Cam Ward he was the most talented player if he were any other position he would have been drafted
Rich Eisen in his feelings …hilarious..why can’t everyone see what the fans see…some people are really out of touch with reality
This kid is another bronnie James he's just not that good and he doesn't belong in the league and sadly because of his attitude I doubt he can a back in the NFL
Joe really don’t like sheduer it shows everybody true colors exposed
I just witnessed three men, excluding Rich Eisen, do their level best to make excuses and outright dance around the truth about NFL owners black balling Shadeur Sanders.
Teams take people with red flags because they are good players with a willingness to be coached and learn.  They all seem to possess a character that makes everyone around them better.  Does Sanders have that?  Maybe.  Would he have been as good at Colorado if Hunter wasn't playing with him?  Probably not.
He should go throw for some teams to get drafted. He should have went to the combine.
Controlling the narrative and Rich  and Davis  are right and the other just like the rest keeping a black man down in plain sight because they want him to be some other dude he is a rich kids he thrives because of his talent and his faith in God he will rise 👀
Sanders will be picked by the Cowboys, all the stars are aligning
If he wasn't  Deions son nobody would be talking about him.
Crazy how Sanders is getting all this praise and poor Cam Ward dream of being 1st overall is not being talked about. Sanders and his dad made this bed by saying certain teams he won't play for so let them lie in it. We should be having conversations about Cam and expectations for the Titans
6:10 the Sanders would never do that.
Humble Pie being served on the buffet  at the Sanders' draft party.  Gabriel being picked had to be a kick in the groin
Media watch a leftest watchdog group reports that The NFL network and ESPN has mentioned Race every 2 1/2 minutes. Rich Eisen beats that.
Sometimes being good enough is just not enough!
I reject the fact that this young man should have to call and beg anyone. The narratives with this story will go two ways:  1. If he gets drafted and balls out, oh my gosh how did you let him fall to ___ round.   2. If he ends up not being drafted or plays poorly...see this is the reason why he slipped in the draft. Many want his success to be predicated on the doors they opened instead of accepting the young man as he is and seeing what he brings to a franchise.
Dude's "pushback" is bogus from the jump, simply bc teams made Sheduer a backup by not selecting him,  [alluding to REs "teams ignore certain players red flags and crucify others' flags" theory] Sanders is good enough to have gone 2nd QB overall DEFINITELY by the 3rd rd  Teams chose not to for reasons that don't match what he has done on the field throughout his entire 🏈 career
You people in the comment section crying racism as usual need to grow up. From all accounts his interviews were TERRIBLE full of self centered narcassim. Start placing the blame where it belongs, on him and his attitude and behavior, period.
They want this men to beg wtf is going on
This is priceless 😂😂😂
shedeur  gon shock the world.. just keep grindin
Rich is finally getting it Either this is strategically played by Dion or The NFL  Doesn't like the sander's name
If it was about race then why would Cam ward go #1?
Eli manning was cocky during the draft
If you have to give reassurances that you're not going to be a distraction then you already are a distraction
Just imagine having Sanders as your backup QB. Deion on social media complaining every time the team loses and the starter only has an okay game. NOBODY wants that.  Nobody wants Deion Sanders criticizing the OC on twitter and national television.
4:30 Well DUUUHHHH who wants the hassle of having Deon on their coaching staff when they didn't hire them? I hope he falls to Mr Irrelevant.
This is deeper anyone who Deion coach will be threatened he's gonna lose players at Colorado. The NFL is going deeper than shedeur, they opan to destroy Deion, anyone Deion coach gonna get scared of going through this too. More players gonna go through the portal now at Colorado and leave Deion. They want his soul
So now you want Shedeur to beg to get drafted?! GTFOH
you should know the answer. It’s his dad. Nobody wants to deal with him. He runs his mouth acts like he’s better than everybody else and nobody wants to deal with that. That locker room will be crazy because of him. He isn’t a generational talent so he can be easily replaced.
Mel kipers #1 rated quarterback (the most important position in the sport) was just advised to beg for a job in the fourth round lmaoooo and we’re supposed to believe this wasn’t a manufactured attempt to embarrass him?
I can't wait for Deion to play the race card. You know it's coming.
Deion’s energy doesn’t play inside a son’s body that isn’t an all time great athlete.  Also, Rich E can’t be objective. They are friends with Prime.
A little Humility goes a long way. No matter the talent.
It's Ok they are trying to humiliate him but he is undeniable someone will bite
It’s grotesque that two of these guys advice is “grovel for the executives” and they won’t address the gap between sanders And qb’s that have already been drafted.
Rich isn't wrong that a lot of guys with huge red flags are picked.
You get him and Dion?  Dion could probably still be a Back up CB
REFUSE!!!
Could it be the league  sees his true value and not the hype.?
I feel bad for you paranoid people. You know nothing about capitalism. Capitalists, especially as a group, take nothing personally over profit.
Nobody wants the circus. Sanders can SAY whatever... but eventually, the circus comes to town. Is Shedeur is a backup, Prime will be all over the media pressuring to get him in a starter role; If he's starting and things are not going well, it will be criticism of the coaching staff. The level of talent required for a team to tolerate all that is extremely high, and Shedeur is simply not at that level.
I think a portion was his dad saying in the media that he would only let him play for certain teams.  Teams don't want parents interference in potential every decision they make with their player.
What did he say in these interviews?  Must of been bad.
Thank you Rich for pushing back on this bullshit
Stop the cap! This plantation mindset with these "owners" is enough. I am done with this buck breaking racist controlled business. Stop covering for this or be counted with them and expect justice. Justice is demanded. No mercy. No forgiveness.
Men like Rich Eisen are why I’m not proactively on race but reactive.   He highlighted why Shedeur isn’t drafted.   There’s 32 owners I think one is Arabic in Jacksonville then an Asian lady in Tennessee.   Jacksonville didn’t need a qb with Trevor’s contract and Tennessee went with Cam.     Shedeur came off as haughty, arrogant and entitled. Your going to these good ol boys as a so called black with that approach is unacceptable. Those good ol boys are in position to pay generational wealth and you’re still an employee to them so only so much flamboyance will be tolerated. It turned them off and out of spite….here he goes undrafted.    The message is clear…..stay in your place boy!!! Playing in our league is a privilege which it is and u will kiss a certain amount of a$$ if u want to play in it.
Joel is right .
Honestly  I did not expect to hear that
This is what happens when a team doesn't want to deal with the circus that comes with him. Humble yourself young man.
Beginning about around @5:40 I think he mist have lost his mind to even say that a grown man accomplished as he is up to this point should do what he suggested...
Really not that deep. The media grades different than scouts and coaches. Interviews play a role a major component of that is white boards and getting to know how QB processes plays. You can’t just dismiss “bad interview” just like you can’t dismiss “nothing pops about his talent” 🤷 It’s up to him to prove NFL wrong when he plays
This has gone on a long time in the US. Where else in the world do you see young athletes wear giant gold chains and stupid looking suits before they have even done anything its ridiculous and now someone takes it to the extreme and everyone is crying well what did you expect?
His nfl comp to me is a jacoby brisset. Thats not a 1st or 2nd round pick
Reality check, he is not being evaluated as a transcendent quarterback. Limited athleticism with good pocket presence and accuracy. I am a bit surprised that he is still on the board but he can let his play do the talking once he lands with a team. It is any team's right to make whatever choices they want to make, too many analysts without anything to lose commenting about their outrages concerning this. Let team's live with their decisions, if they are wrong then they will have to deal with the consequences. But what if their inclinations are correct?
Shedur has lost many millions. I hope his NIL was good😮
😂 He's reaching for Daniel's Jeremiah help lol 10:35
Bears won the 2nd round. 3 picks including Luther.
This is some bs the kid can play
It's not personal. The kid is not that good 😕
Devin is responsible for this shot💩
He and his father brought this on…  arrogance is what has brought him down.
Doesn’t matter if you have an NFL interview or an interview at Taco Bell…you don’t walk in and act like a prick. That’s the real reason he hasn’t been picked.
Why should he lower his confidence? Sources said that he wasn’t harsh or rude , he just didn’t want to accept what they thought of him ? So what was actually said
Rich... I hope you read this... you are ridiculous!
I agree this is a statement against Sanders just like the Balls in basketball. I mean the nfl had no problem drafting Manuel Mayfield etc.
Let's hope Jerry drafts him We need more Dallas drama
Calling him "undrafted" is such clickbait. The Draft isn't even halfway done. Calm down
The sanders family should prepare a lawsuit against the nfl because this is a conspiracy hate crime ,take it to the supreme court and win the public  and damage the nfl brand at best .
If you draft Shedeur Sander, you're drafting Deion as well. And if things don't go well, Deion is going to have opinions. How many owners/GMs want to deal with that?
Saving the Best for last! Go Shadeur!!!
Self reflection for Shedeur?  No.  Self reflection for the teams.  B.S.
I collect Trevor Lawrence cards... I'm happy.
Yall not addressing the elephant in the room. Say it out loud
I thought Cleveland would be a great fit but if you say you dont want to play there then you dont get drafted pretty simple. Alot if nfl teams already had their QBs in place.
Why does  Shedeur have to sell himself he did that with his college career his numbers don’t lie he is a very good QB. The two white guys with bad suits on the panel are delusional talking about he should make some calls gtfoh
Rich “White Guilt” Eisen
We laugh at the man that says to beg but that might just be what to do. You don’t want to not be undrafted 😢
The only reason people care so much about this is because he is Deion’s son. If he was anyone one else this would be a non story. This family has been over hyped since they came to Colorado only to win a few games the first year and be ranked in the top 25 the second year when they didn’t deserve it.
"we are trying to pass a test we don't have the answers to" that's how ALL tests work
Just tell the truth. He is not good enough for all the drama and baggage coming with him.  No way in hell anyone is going to want to put up with the NFL version of Lavar Ball.  Not for someone who at best is a career backup QB.
GET EM RICH!  He know why they doing that boy like that.
Punishing these young men because of who their fathers are is truly disgusting. Thank God for the guy in the black!!!!
It’s funny how they try to explain away the fact nobody wants to put up with the drama and he’s just a sub par quarterback that was on a sub par team
Man you crazy, telling Shedeur to beg, he will not bow to no one but God.
We knew Cam Ward was going number one, I don’t really mind Dart being the second quarterback taken because there were a lot of people that thought that that might happen, and I do believe he probably fits the Giants organization better than Sanders would  have. That being said, the only way that happened was because Pittsburgh passed on him at 21 which kind of shocked me, but I was like OK well, he’s going to fall to the second round. It is what it is. He’ll be gone within the first few pics because either the Browns or the Raiders or the Saints will take him. And then they didn’t take him either. And then quarterbacks started coming off that are nowhere near as good as him, it is obvious it is a blackball now. Him falling out of the first round was surprising, him falling out of the second round was confusing, him falling out of the third round and having to go to day three in the draft is purposeful and disgusting. And at this point, these guys are right, I’m worried that he may not get picked at all, and if he does, it may be around six or seven because nobody is going to want their back up quarterback being a distraction which absolutely now he is being drafted to be a backup. Which is also shameful.
I dunno why people are surprised, he's an incredibly arrogant player who brand himself as a legend when he hasn't done anything.   He's gonna be a backup wherever he goes. I hope he can be humble.
They want him to beg to be drafted? FOH...he can play football PERIOD THEE END. This is an absolute embarrassment to the NFL
And this is why the NFL and sports are losing ratings and some fans. Now, sheduer needs to beg GM to pick him up based on what? They want to humble him. Smh.
The NFL league does not like Deion Sanders way of sticking behind his son. I lived long enough to know that in the Black race if you appear to be too supportive of your child you will get negative feedback from bias people. There is a God, and he does not like people who hate on others, and it will be alright. Shedeur Sanders keep your faith in God you will be okay!
There's something that we don't know
He outplayed caleb williams and bo nix.  Yall mist have forgot.  His pinpoint accuracy and vison is one lf the best.  Remeber thiers only a few good qb and the rest suck, sp dont trust these gms.
Hell naw.... call up g.m's BEGGING for a job???? Thatll never happen. Go back to college,  kid...
They trying to Buck Break this man
What people are missing is that companies all interview potential employees , if you don't interview great then they dont hire you. Simple as that! Be humble and when being interviewed show them your willing to work with them, not against. His interview is not just behind closed doors with the NFL teams, its everything he puts out for people to see.
While no one can deny Deion's athletic skill set during his time in the NFL, the thing that I remember most is his narcissistic attitude, and its obvious the apple didn't fall far from the tree...teams are looking for a leader and a team player...they don't want someone who's not going to accept responsibility for his mistakes and blame other teammates on social media for his own shortcomings...Shedeur did that at Colorado, and his father allowed him to get away with it...I hope the young man realizes this and can make amends for his misguided actions.
Watching this you would have thought that Rich Eisen is the one that went undrafted. Give me a break man
I'm with Rich Eisen on this one and I definitely ain't about to call and beg to get drafted. He's getting drafted at some point.
He is just not that good. Simple.
If you draft him, the father comes with him. Not good.
Shadeur might get drafted on day three, certainly by the seventh round seems very likely. Hey, my lions have three picks in the third round, so if he's still on the board by then, I'd definitely take him. My lions need a backup that they can train to be the future, and shadeur wouldn't need to start right away, he would have plenty of time to develop and learn under jared goff. He would have 4 or 5 years until the lions would make him the starter, and by that time i trust that he would be ready, kind of like aaron rodgers with the packers.
Rich is right my man is sounding like a corporate puppet over... The Sanders family is being respectfully disrespected.
I know this is far stretch but I think the bears should give him a chance put a battle in between Caleb Williams and Sanders and whoever wins gets the job just like they're doing in college. Cuz I'm not going to lie this kid is a great football player and I think that where he wants to be is going to be hard to get.
S/O to rich eisen for saying what it really is. They tryna show the sanders family a lesson.
Nobody’s gonna pick him because of the social media thing he already has it going on social media. He doesn’t care if he gets drafted or not.
Hell no, he shouldn’t beg. 😂😂😂
He'll be a back up for the jaguars. Undrafted...
Rich Eisen is about to explode and cry... Nobody wants to deal with the headaches of the Sanders family.
Kids in college wanted all the power, this is the NFL putting their foot down
No dude u were never like shedeaur dude
I hope you were listening..... This is where life experiences and perspectives come into play..,.
Ngl , they might show them sanders now something , i would call it power , but just pray for 1 thing…when both sanders get in the league and they both get to start , pray for a bad season. Bcs 1 thing is for sure , the day they both stepp in the field , they gona show how tf they messed with. It’s gona hurt points wise and truuuust me…a lot of yall wr and rb might get hurt reaaaal bad. Yall gona feel the accuracy and yall gona feel the headache. Make no mistake about it , they both are not perfect players but guess what ? They are coachable issues. When they get those fixed and get to start ? It’s over for everyone who made them go through what they had to go through. Shedeur will be a better QB than 90% of the league and shilo will be an all pro safety/cb maybe even get his nickname feared by everyone. Watch them both for more than 3 years now. Since shedeur coming back from his mid season in jackson st and shilo hitsticking SEC players until now. The teams messed up probably really bad by disrespecting them and it’s gona probably show itself once they get play. It’s a matter of time. Remnants that.
They don't want to deal with his and his father's attitude.
No NFL team wants the drama that comes with the Sanders clan, he also is not good enough to overcome that. They just don't need it and none of these guys sitting at this desk has the guts to say it, they know why. He is poison.
Love Rich, but clearly his friendship with sanders family is clouding his judgement… if shedeur was half a$$ing  interviews being overtly cocky, it’s going to rub ppl the wrong way.. it comes off as entitled..  do you really want a entitled qb?   I wouldn’t … and interviews must have been pretty bad given his tape says otherwise
I think I remember Deion Sanders saying he wouldn't let his son play for certain teams
They aren’t drafting him because they are worried Deon will take their job
God loves you enough to humble you. Hope the ENTIRE Sanders family heeds that message. Humble yourselves.
Tell me Dion didn’t phone Rich and pay him off 😂and you know Rich wanted to cry racism 😂 next time maybe daddy won’t tell people they will turn down certain city’s 😂 take a peace of this humble pie my brother
This is what happens when you ego outweighs your talent!
Life sometimes has a way of dishing out some humble pie and after reading how Shedeur’s interviews went I think the young man got just what he needed. Talent is very important but it’s very obvious NFL teams also place value on character
Murders been playing in that league MY WHOLE LIFE
I got 500 bucks on sanders going undrafted....
I think it is better for him at this point to be undrafted
Buck breaking in 2025..
AAAAHHHHHHHH HAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
Tim Tebow effect... not worth the trouble
He’s going to the UFL
Is anyone really surprised who wants to put up with Deion Sanders crap Talk about a dad not letting the son do his thing. His son‘s already obnoxious who wants to deal with two of doing that.
These are sound, realistic comments on exactly what is happening right now between this particular family and their attitude, and the NFL owners.   The NFL is huge. No one is going into their house and telling them how things are going to be. Period. Message sent, message received. Future generations are learning from the 2025 experience.
As a former NFL player, I never thought Sheduer was a top QB and can clearly see his arrogance. I didn’t think he would drop this bad.  From what I’m hearing internally, he was awful and disrespectful in interviews. The NFL combine report of him coming in like he didn’t need the NFL was really disrespectful.  He doubled down in one on one interviews.  This is 100% Deion fault and Daniel is 100% correct. Also, these means Sheduer will be on a short leash. Any disrespect and he’s out of the league.
He's cooked. Probably undrafted now
A LOT of black dudes in these comments crying that their boyfriend hasn't been drafted yet...
5:15 So, would you have given this pick-up the phone and beg for a job-you need to humble advice to Aaron Rodgers, his father or his reps when he was sitting in the green room all by himself?! No sir you would not!!
Shedeur being passed for Dart, Shough, Milroe, and Gabriel.  The only 2 logical explanations are the possibilities that they are afraid that papa Deion might interfere and do some personal coaching from any team that takes him - Which could put any team that drafts Shedeur in ruins - OR - Somebody must have caught Shedeur doing drugs - Which would explain why he's skinny.  AKA Josh Rosen.
Was everyone upset when Kellen Moore went undrafted?
Just say you dont know. How about speak the truth
If his interviews were as bad as has been reported, that's why Shedeur hasn't been picked. No conspiracy.
I need to find me someone who loves me like rich loves Deion
Rich is glazing his buddies son. Nobody wants to deal with the drama that Deion will bring to their team. Every negotiation will be a nightmare. No business owner wants to hire drama
legendary adjective leg·​end·​ary ˈle-jən-ˌder-ē  -ˌde-rē Synonyms of legendary 1 : of, relating to, or characteristic of legend or a legend
Caleb Williams did some of the same stuff with better talent. Came off as snobbish, and so did his play. Now you are saying Sanders' talent is less than the third round because of his Dad's mouth? And then you want him to privately reach out and convince someone to pick him for the draft when you know teams will leak that he did so. SO he needs to humble himself and leave the arrogance. If that ain't buck breaking, I don't know what it is.
This is obvious  NFL Collusion !! However The Shield has spoken! For whatever reason they have decided to set a precedence and I have the problem with it!
I'm with rich on this argument. So what the second guy is saying... Klat...sanders shouldn't come in to the league thinking he's a starter?....that might be the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Anybody. Name one controversy about Shaddeur Sanders off the field.  I'll wait.   His play on the field speaks for itself. He's as talented as any quarterback in the draft.   So the question is, what's really going on?  Yes. It's personal. They have, team owners and management, a problem with a strong Black father and his son with ZERO contreversies.  And throughout it all, the young man has remained nothing but positive. That alone should also speak volumes to everyone watching, especially decision makers in the draft process.
When did "narrative" become the must-have, use-all-the-time buzzword?
This is clearly a flex of power by the higher-ups clearly
If you look at his highlight reel that they were showing during the draft. Some people said half of those passes would have been intercepted in the pros. He was playing against mediocre competition most of the season and he did play against good teams he didn't play that great. Colorado didn't turn it around just because of him he had 60 other transfers. If he was a good quarterback he would have been drafted
I think he has fallen so far now teams are worried he will be an issue and bitter about the fact he was not a first rounder. Might have gone in the third if this was not a concern
"The worst formal interview l've ever been in in my life," the anonymous coach exclaimed. "He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates...but the biggest thing is, he is not that good."
Sanders is a model draft pick he can play and keeps clean off the field so you just don't want him 😢
Bro these people crazy
They will regret not drafting him mark my words
There is a singular message. Football is a team sport.
I feel bad for Shedeur. This is his dad's fault for raising him this way and making everything a spectacle. He passed his overinflated ego on to his son and now reality is setting in. All the talk they were doing before the draft, retiring his jersey, that ridiculous room they built for the draft, the dollar sign logo, the gigantic diamond chain. His dad let him think hes the best in the world and seems to never have taught him humility.  Its not the kid's fault.  Im disappointed in Rich for being such a Deion apologist. My bet is teams dont think Shedeur is able to lead and be credible in a locker room and that's the main issue.
Blackballed or something off the field issue?
Sanders just isn’t good enough. He played at Colorado. Not a great school, played against lesser talent it was easier to think he was ok but against the best, he’s pretty low on that list
What exactly did Shedeur do on the field to warrant a top 10 pick? He was never a heisman finalist. He won 2 big games with an actual heisman winner and top 2 pick on the team. Hell, if this was last year’s class he wouldn’t have been close to being at the top of the position. And because last year’s class was so deep, there were only a few teams that needed to address QB.   I’m not saying there isn’t some kind of collusion happening from teams to teach him a lesson, but he was never that good on tape. Low demand for the position, and a low grade on the position group as a whole has teams passing on taking QB altogether
rich eisen: "...the NARrative, the NARrative....mlah mlah the NARrative..." ad nauseum
Why does Rich seem personally offended by this?
Collusion
Cam newton w similar attitude talented drama queened himself out the league…sanders unproven w the same attitude no surprise 😂
All I’m hearing is “we don’t like him being confident in himself”. This is absolutely sickening. Say what you want, we all know there weren’t 100 better players in this draft than Shedeur. Yes, every team didn’t need a QB but the ones who do, including my Steelers are being dumb as hell.
you guys honestly thinking Deion wouldn't be a problem is absurd.
These clowns really sitting here saying it’s about the personality. Guys, if you aren’t drafted in the first 3 rounds as a QB you just suck. Plain and simple.
As CFB guy i wonder what this may do to colorado recruiting. Travis going number 2 was huge but now this is the story of the draft
gerald McCoy...hard pass
I think they are close to why he hasn’t been picked yet. At least they gave a few rational explanations. There have been many examples of talented players that haven’t been picked in the past because of certain factors. Some of the things they mentioned could be medical related issues, do they fit in the system, character issues, physical skills, etc. I don’t understand why guys like Eisen and Kiper are trying to float tinfoil hat conspiracy theories about why he hasn’t been picked. Eisen and one other guy floated the theory that the NFL is trying to teach Deion a lesson by not drafting his kid. Personally, I think the reason he hasn’t been picked is because franchises don’t want to use a top draft pick on someone they has to many unknowns. The truth is Sanders has not put himself out there in his interviews, nor has he showcased his physical skills in private workouts to teams. He has, however, had a huge social media presence, but that isn’t going to get you drafted.
Part of this is the lack of actual talent. What does Sheduer do WELL? All everyone can say is " he can play " The other part is You media guy's fault. Since the start of the draft, his name was the biggest story. ESPN  talked more about HIM than the number 1 pick AS HE WAS BEING PICKED....and afterwards. You media buddies treated the #1 pick as a footnote and that wasn't fair. You media guys hoped he would go to the Steelers and, even now, care more about why Pittsburgh didn't pick him, when they picked EXACTLY who the local PITTSBURGH Media said they would for months. You guys forced on Sheduer and not a young man that LOST HIS MOM IMMEDIATELY after he went to the hospital and told her he was drafted.  Just pushed him aside. Do you want a story? That's your story......but NONE OF YOU CARE BECAUSE DEION IS YOUR BUDDY.
Lmao Deion Sanders in full cope
Rich is going to cry😂
Thank you Rich for speaking up for Shaduer!!
Im sorry what a horrible take again on sanders by that dude in the burgundy blazer.  His team mates said he's a leader and the only narrative going around is created by men like this. Thankfully 2 of the guys on the panel had sense
You can not explain a conspiracy when you are not in the room. 😡This is the second time in my lifetime that I have seen the NFL take down a talented QB down for personal reasons. In the mean time we have a convict & a rapist in the White...🤐
Doug Flutie, Tim Tebow, and Colin Kaepernick know full well that NFL teams don't want a backup QB with cameras in their face.
Here’s a novel idea. Maybe you all can’t evaluate QB’s as well as you think you can.
Jesus Christ Rich, this is getting embarrassing for you. Rich, you are aware that there are hundreds of other players involved in this draft, right? It's like you placed a huge bet on Shadeur getting drafted...
It’s his arm. The ball arrives late and he puts too much arc on his throws because his arm strength isn’t sufficient. Many of his TDs in college would have been INTs in the league.
I love how all of the people in the comment section is running their mouth and being parrots repeating bs that they heard for months. The fact that yall "think" his dad will be chatting about him like he dont already have a job is absolutely crazy. This is all about the hate of his father. What team doesn't want a player to come in and bring fans to the stadium? I just don't understand how people can hate someone they dont know. I just dont get it
Don’t talk to me, I’ll be gone by the time u draft.
Lack of talent is not the issue with Shedeur, the guy can play.   It's not racism (c'mon, please stop).   It's not Deion (he's not going to be playing).  My take...#1, the personal interviews went very badly.   Impossible for us to know what went down.  And #2, no team wants Shedeur's  "Legendary" stuff in the locker room.  Shedeur's act is WAY over the top, let's be honest.  NFL teams are thinking the disruptions and distractions for the TEAM are not worth the risk,  what else can it be?
Tons of Sheduer haters out there
Rich Eisen is %100 correct F these commentators scared of the NFL to say it
Maybe he's just not that good.
NFL is public…..
This sounds like a bunch of nonsense! Funny how a confidence, bravado and leadership is celebrated for some and punished for others! Y’all keep with the mental gymnastics to explain this away
Cam Newton had huge plans for off the field and a big ego too. But Cam is bigger, faster, and stronger than Sanders
Rich is so afraid of Deon, but so is everyone in the media, it’s comedy gold now.
So no one wants to talk about that Deion would be looming and holding his own press conferences after every game?
Folks saying “he’s just not that good” or that this is strictly a talent issue are lying to themselves at best and being willfully “blind” at worst. We all know it’s much deeper than that. Don’t bury your heads in the sand like many tend to do to try to avoid having the tough but necessary conversations.
Klatt is such a simp.  What a pathetic, weird, pandering display yesterday.
I feel bad for the dude beside rich. He’s lost so much money on draft kings so far. He keeps betting that sanders is the next pick. And the next pick. And the next pick 😂
Character and your ability to grow and take directions is important in any career field. Shadeur wasnt that good and he came off entitled, that why he wasn't drafted stop blaming other factors. Nobody wants bs and drama. Ward and other QBs drafted because their upside was highet because they will take direction and improve...
Think a bunch of people in here confused by what Rich is saying lol. He made good points and always has. If a team is THAT afraid of the “circus” they too need some self reflection, wether that’s considered in vs his and other available talent in Rd 3 or Rd 7 I don’t know and clearly he doesn’t either, but the point is valid.
Shedeur is not the problem, its his dad.
No one wants the Sanders circus, Rich just doesn't get it.
Shadeur was never that good.  I don’t know how you could think he was that good if you watched him play.  It’s nearly all hype and GMs aren’t putting their jobs on the line for hype.
I would not want him and have to deal with his dad....I pass too..
Shedeur weight,215 lbs. With chains,245.
This isn't a factor of talent over everything narrative it's you are not bigger than US and we will humble you immensely. I pray the Colts sign him because they need competition.
DON'T CARE ABOUT SANDERS .  WHATEVER MAN.
Right talent he isn’t as talented as yall think
They punishing him BECAUSE OF PRIME and he has never BEEN COACHED BY ANYONE ELSE!   NFL WRONG FOR THIS.   DUDES 1ST ROUND TALENT AND U KNOW IT.  2ND ROUND EARLY AT THE LATEST.   THIS WAS ORCHESTRATED.  ITS DAMN SHAME that young man cant help who his daddy is.  He arguably top 1 or 2 QB in the damn draft anf HE IN 4TH ROUND STILL NOT DRAFTED THIS IS  BOLOGNA. IM WITH RICH ON THIS.
I wish Shedeur the absolute best… I’ve watched players have legal issues and truly be a terrible person get drafted .. people can’t say “he’s not good” because fam he’s better than most the QBs drafted this year.
The Bottom Line is this is BS... You can say what you want to say but everybody is asking about Shadeur!! He is on everybody's mind. Call it what it is, everybody wanted hear his name called. Now he is the talk of the Draft. They are mad because he is that Dude. It is what it is! Lol He'll be alright in the words of Kendrick Lamar. Everything he does is Blessed 🙏🙏
bronny ruined it for all future nepo athletes lebron james!!! oh yeah and sheduer sanders brother was sued for 10 million and lost for injuring someone in a small fight at a bar. there family is a mess... too ratchet for the m word. millionaire.
Last time the niners won the SB there was a sanders on the team. I would rather put up with shadeur's bad optics than overpay purdy.
The steelers, jets dping way to damn much not drafting shedur, that makes it seem personal.
They love, trying to put a black man in his place remember   Colin Kaepernick.    Black people should boycott(undisclosed amount of games)the NFL for taking so long to pick him.   If they want to show their power why can’t we?
They literally just criticized Shadeur for saying “Thank GOD for Everything” huh…lol…why would he beg for something and tell these teams something they already know, they want him to literally beg our of his mouth…all of a sudden, they are going to value him enough to pick him just because he called and begged quietly…that is definitely an oppressive tactic…by that logic if he says nothing to anyone he and his brother will go undrafted…At this point, Sanders family may as well allow the NFL and its owners , GMs and minions media personnel to completely expose themselves and just keep expressing “gratitude” for everything that happens, because no man nor woman should “beg” for a “job” that they are qualified for no matter what industry they are in, especially when they don’t “need” the job to survive and even then we don’t beg we discuss the opportunity and make a collaborative decision about working together…
Rich I love you but you WOULD NOT be saying any of this if it wasn’t your friends kid…we heard rumors that he was rude and arrogant in these team meetings and dropping like this says to me the rumors are true
I think he's gonna be a backup qb or he is blacked balled from the nfl because of his dad, he's already rich he's already in the spotlight so I don't think he will never be a starter in the NFL!!!!
If the draft was your objective i almost predicted this from the beginning.  I wish him well but it was handled poorly by the sanders clan. And sheduer didnt take it seriously.  He passed on the combine and interviewed poorly. This is the end result. Gotta admit small time Colorado might be impressed but the nfl is huge and wasnt
If you think Shedeur is good, it’s malpractice as a GM to not take him if you think he’s good.  Idk, makes no sense that these hyper competitive teams would band together like this unless nobody thinks he’s that good.  If he was good enough ppl would be fighting to trans him.
It is personal, his personality
Another black eye for the NFL. This is messed up
Rich it’s all this legendary crap that he keeps saying. He’s not a legend and that just rubs people the wrong way man. He needs to show that he will be somebody that needs to learn every day not someone that knows it all already.
Drafting Shedeur would immediately turn your locker room into the Zoolander movie.  Imagine the immediate endorsement deals from Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton, Rolls Royce.  The Lithuanian supermodel girlfriend.  The $200k mink coat on gameday.  Shedeur is a good player, but he has not won anything in the NFL yet.  Drafting him would be tantamount to ruining your 2025 season.  It would be a spit in the face to the other 52 guys in the locker room.  Don't be surprised if he goes UDFA and has to agree to terms (like no endorsement deals, no flashy cars, etc.) in order to get a camp invitation.
You know this is clearly a racial issue.  If his family name was Manning, Brady, or Rodgers he would have been selected number 1. However his brand is larger than life and the NFL teams are like you are a slave and a worker. Rich is totally right ✅️ this is a personal vendetta but you are blessed.
This is terrible
Sheduer just aint that good...maybe he is a 4th or 5th round player...simple as that
Maybe the league doesn’t think Sanders hadn’t really played against any really tough competitions.
Shadeur walked into NFL team interviews acting like the second coming of Jesus, and nobody wants that unless you can back it up.
The QB position is not different, we see TOE all the time 😂
He's way to arrogant and prideful telling people he's going to rearrange an organization because he's that special. He's getting what he deserves with that false pride
Deion can take credit and blame - he instilled HIS personality into his son, but couldn't instill his level of talent. Shedeur is a VERY good COLLEGE quarterback. He's not applying for a job in college though...
Teams bring crews not players
Obviously it’s personal. The teams met him, have seen how he and his dad acted during this whole process and determined that he isn’t talented enough to have to deal with all that. Eisen acting like he is some generational talent is ridiculous. He’s not bad, but stop acting like teams are passing on the greatest QB prospect ever.
Rich Eisen has lost his way
That should deflate his over sized ego and sense of entitlement a bit. He needed it and gotta say its satisfying to see someone get what they actually deserve instead of what sanders thinks he deserves
Deion just got humbled by a group of old billionaires who don't like being held hostage by flashy dudes like Prime, if you catch the drift. This is why you dont say there are "teams I wont allow him to be drafted by." Well they took that and ran with it.
It's 31 teams, not 1, not 2, not 15, and not 20.  It was 31.  Self reflect.
This is the definition of collusion. Nothing new for this league.
He said it best, teams pick up players with red flags like an amusement park….
You want a Black man to beg for an opportunity he deserves smh
Rich finally brought the elephant 🐘 to the room. Will he get drafted tomorrow? Honestly, there is a very high chance he won't and I'm all here for it 😂
Rich is acting like an angry pouty female over this. Why TF you so offended bro?
He’s not nearly good enough for teams to want to also take on his 🤡 father and the whole circus.   Normally someone would have bit the bullet by now but pretty epic that everyone is just saying “nope.”   Definitely the craziest story in draft history, unprecedented.
Its obviously a combination of things..skills, baggage, attitude. Would a few teams put up with some of it if he were a guarantee?... sure. Even fewer teams have a GM that would bet his well being / job on it. Even fewer teams have the organization (top down) that can withstand the attention (media, social media, Deion)and a starting QB that is established enough not to listen to all the background. So now that we've taken 7 slices out of an 8 slice pizza. Those same organizations that are strong and have the ability to get him, stash him, and prep him ALSO KNOW that he'll slide and be avail on day 3 (if that)  Its not one clear cut reason...its a multitude of reasons.  And the fact that we are on YT commenting about it and not making that decision for a billion dollar business (team)...should be taken into consideration.  And for the people who are so offended by his not being drafted yet, would suffer from the same apparant lack of humility (especially from Dad)and entitlement and would suffer from the same fate if they were in his shoes.  Get on social media and say that youre going to take this as a life lesson and not a reason to be bitter...he'd get drafted immediately.  Amazing how many people are "too proud to be taught" for him...like somebody betting somebody else life on something without hesitation. Would you allow your life to be bet on and lived by another person. Smh, this world. Main character syndrome is an epidemic.
The funny thing to me is all the teams who need a quarterback and passed on him don’t have better options than him LV PITT NO for example a team SF do you really think that they want to pay Brock Purdy that money they think he is a product of their system these franchises with their way of conducting business are failing because at the end of the day it’s about putting the best product out there for their respective fan bases and in 2025 still don’t get it.
If Shedeur and his Dad had the attitude that Daniel Jeremiah described, Sanders would have been drafted already.  Teams are telling players that they are done with the egos and entitlement, especially by players who have not spent a millisecond on an NFL field.  I'm happy to see it.
How many big wins for Colorado under Sanders? NFL is a huge leap in competition. GMs and scouts don't see a skill set or attitude it takes to win at the next level.
Sort of sad and humbling but I hope this fuels the kid to grow
My God I love Rich Eisen. His voice is calming and reassuring. He's always so diplomatic and nice about things.
Rich seems to be letting his personal relationship with Prime cloud his remarks. This is honestly the most unprofessional I have ever seen Rich Eisen.
If the league never turns down talent, why did no team put up a 1st round pick to sign an MVP in Lamar Jackson?
Can’t stand Deon, not a fan of his kid’s better than you attitude but it smells funny that teams that are struggling passed. After all his stats should earn him a shot.
The NFL is full of crap
Might want to look at Colin K. if you think the media circus doesn't matter
Oh my God
I think the problem is Prime. Your starting qb starts to struggle get ready for lavar, sorry, Prime pushing for Shadeur.
It is total BS that Shedeur wasn't picked yet. He's the new Kap!
could they draft his brother before Shedeur ? HAHAHA
These clowns know nothing about football, they are afraid to say the truth. He is a me person with no accountability.
Rick you should have sat out on the question being friends with Deion. Not a good look.
It’s called “buck breaking” fellas. There is no mystery here. This is classic American History.
Begging???? Nah……
If his name was “Manning” or “Manzell” he’s top 20 1st Rd!!
I’m telling you..media isn’t covering it but he was allegedly interviewing with teams as if he would be drafted way before those teams even got to pick..very few players have ever been able to be that way..even the most confident/arrogant players humbled themselves in those draft interviews..I think the hype blinded him and he forgot that he needs to play the part during the process of getting to the draft
Rich had a great point and buddy disputed him by changing direction quick  The pros didn’t agree with the always wrong experts  They do their best but can’t understand attitude is everything  And they obviously believe ….
His dad is Deon . The man was super talented. But only loyal to money. I think a lot of teams think that Shedeur will be a I want more problem. Teams probably don't want to deal with Deon anymore. Zero loyalty. It will be all about Sanders .
Yall want him to beg… this is ridiculous…
Hey, maybe don’t kids to a 4-win team by 18 points, and then by 20 points to a “vastly inferior” BYU team. It’s not personal. It’s because they watched him show he can’t beat below average talent in back to back games. QB is a leadership position and he didn’t show any.   Talk about a slew of bad takes here. I mean he can FEEL that it’s personal, but it isn’t. It’s because he’s not as talented as ppl think. Not big, not strong, not mobile and not a good leader. Those are all HUGE red flags. The narrative that he survived a bad OL is all covering for the fact he can’t decipher defenses fast enough and isn’t mobile enough to elude slower and less talented players than he is going to face. Y’all are coping hard with the glazing.
Nobody wants the extra baggage of Deion telling the team how to use his son. Causing issues with the team drafting Shedeur.
Guy in red jacket is full of it
COLLUSION
Hellooo CFL!
When your dad's mouth gets you black balled.
When the best drafting organization ( Steelers ) who are in need of a QB bypass Sanders, it’s more than just teams sending a message.  His interview must have gone terribly wrong and these FO simply said we don’t want to deal with this.  He’s going to disrupt that locker room and it’s not what teams want to deal with.
Rich had a great point and buddy disputed him by changing direction quick
No one wants sanders due to his dad....they know that they can't mold a young qb into what they want as long as Deon is there acting a fool.
Lol straight racism
Joe Klatt rawer than a mf at this analyst stuff
Victimization in the nfl too? Bahahahahaha give me a break.
Eisen’s Deion bias is showing! Travis Hunter is a generational talent, Shedeur is not, he’s a slightly above average player who in the right situation can be a productive player.
13-12.  1-8 vs top 25. 0-1 in bowl game.who believes that is a resume for a 1st,2nd or 3rd round pick?
But beat up your pregnant GF get arrested and you become one of the highest paid WRs in the league
I don’t know when people especially Black     People will realize he is not that good. Not good enough to be acting like he is all that. The NFL doesn’t need him and the teams have spoken. Everything isn’t about race! Ask Jalen Melroe!
They trying to make him the new Mr. Irrelevant!
This argument is premature until we see what the Steelers do with their fourth round pick. They’ve only had the opportunity to draft two players and those players filled serious needs. If the Steelers pass on Sanders in the fourth round, with their third pick, it’s personal, because they definitely need a back up QB. I think the Steelers end up taking Sanders.
This is a case of don't believe your lying eyes..........NFL saying the 2nd best qb in college not not that good
He is not about to pick up the phi he and beg
I don't know about the other 31 teams but the Steelers were always going to go defensive line and running back.  All this talk about Sanders going to the Steelers was created by the press.  Now that we are in day 3, I can absolutely see the Steelers grabbing this kid.
Better learn how to play WR like terrell Pryor did.
I think these teams are getting to the point where they are over drafting the players with unchecked egos. The only reason he was considered a first round pick was the sanders name otherwise he would’ve fell to the second anyway.
So Cam Ward isn’t cocky? Cut it out. It’s the name. You’re getting a pro and media ready QB and you passed up. I’m glad the Giants decided to pass up on their second Franchise QB in back to back years. Browns has Flacco and Pickett. The Steelers has who? This is insane
Nah...he was an average QB on an average team in an average conference.  I understand Rich trying to defend the Sanders family because his show needs to have Prime return for ratings...but it's not surprising to this NFL fan for over 60 years that he hasn't been drafted. May make a practice squad somewhere.
Dion demanded Colorado retire Shedeurs number. Now Dion will demand Shedeur gets put in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
NFL teams all want to win, that’s it. That’s the most important thing. If they thought the talent was worth a higher pick, he would’ve been drafted already. It’s as simple as that.
Why didn't they bring up Deon spouting off prior to the draft that he wouldn't allow his kid to play for certain franchises. Deon is as much the reason why Jr. didn't get drafted as Jr's play and attitude
I know Sanders brings a lot of ego and drama, but I'm confident he elevates any team he goes to. I would take him over Dak any day.
5:34 NFL definitely colluded to keep Kaep out. All unpopular takes are somewhat dipped in some truth. How much, I can’t say. But there’s definitely smoke.
Omg, it’s the league against the Sanders family? That’s why Travis Hunter went high….  Deion was his coach, he should have been shunned too right?
These head coaches especially are afraid they'd be instantly on the hot seat as Deion has stated he'd be open to coaching him in the pros..     Why do you think Bill Belichick couldn't get a job..?  As always, it's about power, control and fear..   Collusion by circumstance..
In plan sight , fans and a blindman can see what they are doing to this young man not right. There have a false narrative about him . Hes a hard worker . No red flags !!!
lol this was a joke and a lie
Shedeur didn't work out for anyone and skipped combine. Cool, so don't play
I still remember when his daddy said he was going top 3 or 5 lol 🤦🏾‍♂️
This is what happens when good talent is FAR outweighed by arrogance and entitlement.  How people can't see it is baffling to me.   Talent wise he's about on par with McCord. Like it or not, that's about where his arm is... He's more mobile and can create, but so is Riley Leonard (who will also be taken ahead of Shedeur).  So you are looking at a guy whose abilities are on the same level as McCord and Leonard, but has played far less competition. Almost had a .500 record at the D1 level. No accolades.... And he acts like he won a national championship and is the best QB in the draft class.   Running his mouth in the media about his offensive line after losses.  Running his mouth about former teammates who transfer.  Rolexes. Chains. Unpaid parking tickets that got swept under the rug at Colorado because of his father.  Openly stated that he won't play for certain teams.  His father also openly stated that he wants a say in where he goes.  Didn't attend the combine.  Ok pro day. AND a jersey retirement a couple weeks ago!!!  Those are extremely big red flags for a guy whose abilities match 5th round QBs.  Call me a hater all you want, but i just gave you a very easy run down on why teams aren't taking him.   We all see it... The media refuses, because of the Deion glazing.   His talent is no where near the head ache that comes with it. That's why he will be the 10th QB taken.   1. Ward 2. Dart 3. Shough 4. Milroe 5. Gabriel 6. McCord 7. Ewers 8. Howard 9. Leonard  10. Sanders
You can tell who’s entitled and who’s not by the comments. If they don’t want sanders they don’t even need a reason… him and his father are the traveling circus. He literally said he won’t let certain teams draft his son 🤷🏻‍♂️🤡
For once in recent history, it’s refreshing to see that the NFL (or any business) finally got tired of all the nonsense.    When the personality greatly exceeds the talent.
Shedeur…please don’t beg.
There’s one rule in the NFL don’t cross the owners
except the cameras ARE coming with him.  If they don't then rest assured his dad will make sure to bring them.
Don’t give me this line that the teams won’t draft guys due to character questions. Even QB’s - Jonny Manzel anyone? If a guy can produce they don’t care.
These two analyst (we know which ones) want shaduer to beg 😂 yt pipo  stop it. Racist 💩
Dispel what narrative? He was 13 and 12, he didn’t have a single game-winning drive in his college career, he wasn’t the strongest or the fastest or the best QB in the class. He refused to participate fully in the NFL combine and only through at his own senior day. Coaches don’t really know his fitness or his work ethic, how strong he is or how he’s gonna deal with adversity in a game. And you have to offer that guy a long-term contract after you draft him, and yes, four years nowadays as long-term. This can only be attributed to his interviewsor his refusal to do interviews with other teams
Everything in this is ego It’s all that will be talked about at his jersey retirement  Super smart move before he’s drafted Good stats award vs. average award
Their goes the word “humble “
as a raiders fan, im just glad we didn't do the dumb raider move & go with arrogant flash. its a 2 for 1 deal. not just an immature spoiled rookie, but another coach in a father that knows more than anyone in the room, & will be a major disruption to his kids training. deon has been rewarded throughout his talented career to be mouthy and selfish. and his kids are off to a good start judging by the footage of them.
8:05 no because Travis don’t have Deion genes. Shedeur just like his dad that’s why.
That's another thing the whole camera thing the social media thing hes right call some Gm's this means a lil humbling but you gotta make these people understand i worked very hard nothing was just handed to me i had to go through the daft like everybody else smfh i hate to see him go through this but now you got a chance to show all the people who passed you up like nike said just do it no flex ball out an walk off the field
I watched Rich for years now, and never seen him like that. He is pissed about the Sanders narative.😂
11:27 "Then, real brief, let's give the other kids some due" is the last forty eight hours of coverage summed up in one sentence.
You dont get picked for only talent.
He already did the work but you want him to “beg” ! You just said it!
Talent can be evaluated. Talent with perceived team disruption can not.  It is avoided.
His dad padded his stats, and rode that travis kid as far as they could.  Didn't care if he got hurt. Just needed him to carry him and his son.
Its like I told my sister once: "Amy, you aren't hot enough to be this stupid."  Shedeur is not talented enough for the teams to want to deal with him and especially his dad.
He must have had the worst interview since Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting!
This is perfect example that Bronny could’ve averaged 20 and 10 at USC & people still would’ve hated. Shedeur produced, broke records & turned his college team around but people still question his skills. No matter what people will hate.
The problem is that this is already a story for not selecting him yet. So no matter where he goes, people will wonder if he’ll take over as a starter
The reason he is undrafted because they want to embarrass him because he is him! Y’all see and now trying to make excuses!
they hate deion that’s why
They want him to beg plain and simple
Don't understand it. He is a good kid, very talented.  I've never seen this
All these teams trying to teach Deion a lesson are going to feel pretty stupid for passing on him soon enough.  These analysts saying it’s Shedeurs fault are kind of ridiculous
It’s personal! Hello man! Wake up!
Maybe hes just not that good?
Lol at him now being a back-up when 72 hours ago eveeryone knew this kid was a 1st round pick. Joel Slatt out here covering for the NFL. You know who his employer is.
Shedeur may need to go the Canada route to the NFL.
This is the black entitled kid can’t be entitled. That’s what this is wake up!
If his last name wasn’t Sanders no one would be saying anything. Oh wait, T J Sanders went in the 2nd round. All teams so far have said pass. They view other players more valuable. He didn’t win the Heisman. If he did then it would be a snub. Brock Purdy went last. He is actually good in the NFL. There was no outrage his family was happy about it. People forget all the big busts of the past, only about 3 or 4 players of this draft will even be known as good.
It might be Deion, but is there also something else GMs know that nobody else does? As scared as some of them are about picking the wrong QB, like Rich said, it seems hard to believe someone wouldn't take a chance with him.
Why is Rich upset over this? Klatt’s answers made sense, so why did they ruffle Eisen’s feathers? So weird.
The Browns selected Manzel, lol
This is not a lesson for the Deion Sanders family because his mother and father are already grownups. You can’t teach them a lesson 💁‍♂️Deion Sanders has already been in the league!He’s already had his time. This is not a lesson for Shedeur Sanders either 💁‍♂️maybe a small one because this young man is a grown man he’s already had an outstanding upbringing by his dad. This lesson is being taught to the new crop of cattle being bought onto the NFL plantation and that lesson  is “you stay in your place because this is what we can do to all of you , we own the team and we essentially own your contract!”This is what they’re trying to teach the new group of mostly African Americans coming onto that plantation! 💁‍♂️Ultimately financially, this young man is gonna be OK because he’s already a young black millionaire however what lesson does he get out of this? If they ultimately pick him up, they gonna ride him on the bench which is disrespectful to his talent however, this is what happens when you have a good ole boy club which is what athletic teams are 💁‍♂️they have to vote each other on and they can do things like this. they’re showing who they are because this wasn’t based on any type of fairness. This young man deserves to be in the league And quite frankly if they recruit him now it would be a form of disrespect and they would pretty much just disrespect his talent! I wouldn’t go on a team or ride the bench for six and seven and eight years and waste my talent. They haven’t taught him anything what they’ve done is they’ve taught America that ain’t much changed that this is the type of people that they really are , this is very disrespectful. The ultimate disrespect is the disrespect that they showed to the fans who appreciate this young man’s talent!💁‍♂️💁‍♂️💁‍♂️💁‍♂️
The nonsense and copium these analysts are spewing because of how wrong they were about sanders is hilarious.
Boooo Wooooo
So you want a guy to be confident enough to lead men, but not outwardly confident!!
This thing about Sanders is a snow job. He's not a running quarterback in his release time is 2.96 seconds per pass. That's what they're looking at.
I think it's more about Deon being in the back round rather than Shedeur
Why are the ‘experts’ stumped? No GM wants to deal with this kid and his dad period
When the ANTICS outweigh the POTENTIAL people will pass on you every time.
He should go to Canada like Moon ! N got talent ! Come on Daniel Jones went in first round first pick for the giants! N they kept giving Jones chance after chance ! Makes me wonder!
Please stop talking about this kid.  Obviously has some serious problems, and it isn't his dad.  I'm betting he has a TON of skeletons in his closet and teams just don't want to deal with his attitude that's been talked about by multiple "NFL executives" during interviews.  He'll get drafted but probably be a career backup.
When it's about Shedeur, Rich lose all objectivity. That's somewhat logical, but it's kind of sad. You're supposed to be a professionnal, leave your feelings at home.
Dude only saying Be humble smh no social media .. thats the whole league right now
The bravado noise chip on their shoulders finally caught up with the Sanders.
DJ is so, so spot on...best opinion and advice, especially for Shedeur!
Sooo.. every team is great and every team got better. Sure. These guys sure know where their bread is buttered.
Not talented enough to get drafted in the first 3 rounds. If he was so great he would have been drafted already despite what his name is. He didn’t win a single game that mattered in college
Rich=Truth!
These guys know literally nothing about football. It’s embarrassing
Told You!
TF does deep reflection in this context mean, weird codes.
Klatt and buddy in light blue suit ya really show me something. Birds 🕊️
Canadian League/USFL…..I’m playing football for somewhere. Definitely ain’t begging nobody.
RAIDERS DRAFT  SHEDEUR HE CLEARLY IS A BETTER CHOICE THAN ANYBODY ON OUR QB ROSTER 🤷 WTF
All of you guys except Rich are full of cow chips!!! This is personal and all of you know it. You three are like The Three Stooges with the nonsense you're stating.
100 dollars says Deion was in the interview rooms with him..
They dancin around the facts its a young powerful black man that doesn't hav to beg cause he"s has money regardless of nfl n the establishment is threatened by the power that comes wit him coaches scared, gm scared.  He is being black balled its clear n obvious.
Colin Kapernick.   What was the issue there?  Someone in the league, to a large degree proven abilities, could not get a job again in the profession.   Shedeur is not actually even in the league so that makes it looking from the inside out amplifying the issue (whatever those may be, real or perceived).  Regards to another sport, consider Ted Nolan.  A fair bit of "...reported that..." mostly after the fact (implication being relying on questionable details reported at the time).
So many haters!!!!!!
Humble pie
His daddy  said there are teams he won't  allow his son to play  for
Hearing these words... "beg" "sell yourself" 🤢 just ridiculous... disgusting
Nobody wants a ego-driven 20-year-old quarterback that thinks he's legendary already lol, only player I can think of on record that said I'm not going to go play here or there or here...how that work out lol, oh and not to mention he played nothing but scrubs and had a losing record LOL, Jes not good lol,cant eait for the race card to be played on ESPN lol 😂😂😂
Football is a game not Life. One day soon the NFL will be insignificant!!!
Rich called it out the others protecting their welfare!
Tom Brady's RAIDERS will pick Sanders in the 6th round, just like Brady was picked and Tom will be in his ear building that CHIP on his shoulder........BOOM, and all will be well with the NFL!🥳
My guess is that Shedeur is seen as a poison pill.  For his entire life his dad has been saying how much better he is than any other QB/player out there.  When he went into those interviews that cocky attitude came with him.  He has talent for sure, in games he is winning he is lights out.  In games where Colorado is losing you can see it in his demeanor.  He doesn't act like the leader he is supposed to be.  There were various rumors that he was an @$$hole to his teammates, but no confirmed statements and everyone wants to discount them.  Well sure no one wants to be officially quoted for that.  His dad is the Head Coach.  The fact is none of the other players can/could say anything about Shedeur without destroying their collegiate career.  Even when the draft is over graduates still can't say anything, as they may need a recommendation or help from Deion.
He's not as good as his baggage and ego. I love Deion but he has not helped the situation. He's raised a entitled   spoiled son that honestly ain't that good.
Maybe he is not that good😮
Shedeur is a clown in and off the field
Sanders should not call teams and sound desperate like two of the guys on the panel said. Black people with confidence are always a perceived threat to white men with insecurities.
He should go back to college at this point lol
In addition to all the mistakes Shadeur done - a) not playing in the senior bowl, b) not being part of the combine, c) Deon saying that we will do the Mannings done for Eli, saying to teams don’t draft him and finally Deon changing the college landscape in terms of the transfer portal, attracting young black men for the Colorado football program; this definitely looks like a cabal.
Lol Joel klatt over here acting as if teams care about character concerns, meanwhile the Ravens are building an all-SA team 😢
All these excuses, but tell me this. Why didn’t Tomlinson take him? How about Pete Carroll? Do they have a grudge or did they just not want him and why?
You can tell who the liberals are. They are emotional versus reality. The k8d was 13-12 in literally the mountains west. He didn't play in the Big 10 or SEC.
If you're going to take a chance on Sanders, draft him low. If him and his dad make a mess of things you cut loose of it and save millions.
So u think the Sanders family and agents not calling teams? Lol Yt ppl say anything shootout to Rich tho
Dude has lost his mind talking about calling around pleading to GMs to take him. It is what it is and everyone knows what the NFL IS TRYING TO DO!
Deion will hire Tony Buzbee to sue to the NFL for collusion after he collects millions from Shannon Sharpe. LOL
Everyone talking around it like it's not obvious. Whys it so hard to say no one wants this kind of distraction for a backup QB?
TOE-Talent over everything is crazy to me. So why isn’t he drafted yet? Every complaint given about Sheduer, was said about Johnny Manziel. Johnny Manziel was actively breaking laws and he was drafted in the 1st road. It’s only a problem when you have the complexion for the protection.
He should be begging
Maybe Roger Goodell isn't a Sanders fan.
People mention past character flawed players who were drafted. Some of the teams looking for a QB were victims. So teams are more picky about them. Shadeur, according to some sources acted entitled, and someone who blames teamates for mistakes. Big red flags if you are going to pay a QB millions. You have to earn your stripes in the NFL first. Then he can act like a diva like his dad. Sounds to me like he went in acting like interviews were pointless for him. I'd take him on the Broncos regardless, I'm not 100% sold on Bo Nix 😂 I know it will never happen, but i can hope
Y’all not serious! Johnny Manzell was a first rounder and a huge red flag! The NFL is sending a message!! The same message that was sent to Colin Capernick! Let’s call a spade a spade!!!
He tries to be his pops and he’s not. He’s confusing ego with confidence. Talking about being humble and actually being humble are 2 different things.
I love the opening comments which basically “Remember, we’re all full of s$&t. The teams will do what THEY need to do, not what we say they should do”
No one wants to deal  with  daddy 😕
Cut it out, come on,if he had the talent that yaw say he has would've been long gone regardless
he definitely needs to fire his agent
I remember when Eli made a stink about not wanting to play for the Chargers. The league picks and chooses who it wants to make the "bad guy" and the "good guy".
He will be a pity pick
At this point, maybe Sanders should go to the rock league ufl play from one of those teams until the NFL gets their act together
Rich, was Tomblin able to control AB, Le'Von Bell, Chase Claypool, Martavis Bryant?  Nah dude, you are glazing Deion.
It’s called collusion
The whole father/son dynamic would have been a huge distraction.  Also how much trust can u have on the coach's son being named the starting QB of the same team he coaches.
It's called RACISM and bigot  Run by nfl owner's and coach period 😊
Rich..we all love ya..but ya gotta separate personal friendship vs. Professional conduct...
Too Late,,,too much glitz & sizzle,,,not enough steak.  It's all on daddy.
No one wants to  deal with  prime time 🙄
No one wants to  deal with  prime time 🙄
At this point just go back to college. He has another year of eligibility.
By this point, I don't think it's one thing INDIVIDUALLY. He's not a GREAT talent AND COMES WITH A CIRCUS. If he were as good as he THOUGHT he was, people would have forgiven the circus at some point tonight, but the talent doesn't warrant putting up with SS's and DS's crap.
Who are these 3 clowns 🤡
My take on Shedeur is that he's been elevated because of his dad, I'll leave others to debate the tape and level of competition. Regardless he should be off the board.   Why has he not been drafted, GMs and Coaches don't want to be told what to do. Secondly, you don't just get Shedeur, you get his Dad. If things don't go well your locker room gets out and into the media. No coach wants that pressure when making decisions.
No coach in the nfl wants Deon prime time calling every day three or four times a day. Tell them how to coach his kid, just one big headache.that no franchise wants to put up with period
Every once and a while a narrative gets exposed for what it is.
QB, unlike any other position, has to be a leader.  Sanders is not showing leadership, just talent.
Rich risen should hire sanders to be his backup
Sanders to aisle 5 with a mop.
The league thinks that he's teaching him a lesson but all the league is doing is showing every player and fan what they really think. We've seen bigger red flags get drafted in the first round time and time again.
Why should he beg Smdh
He's not his dad. But his dad had a reputation that he had amazing talent. But he could have been more amazing, but he was lazy. That's from ex teammates. If anyone thinks he's like his dad. Well, the position is QB. Can't have that. It could be something he said in the interviews. I hope he is angry but humbled and comes to the league with a fire that leads to some kickass football. ✌🏻❤️🙏🏻
It’s his dad’s fault. Deion forgot his son isn’t him, all that talk about who he will or won’t play for, is why his son hasn’t been drafted yet. This is humbling for him I bet.
Sheduer is josh rosen 2.0
Why put out the false narrative, that the young man has no talent, if the teams were worried about something specific then they should have put in on the table.
SS isnt owed anything. These GMs obviously see red flags with this kid and never was a slam dunk prospect to begin with. 94 sacks in 2 years. 😅come on now. He aint all that.
THIS IS THE MOST VIEWERS EVER THE 3RD -7TH ROUNDS WILL HAVE IN NFL HISTORY. NFL IS EATING UP THE RATINGS RIGHT NOW.......
Hold up, you say sanders will be backup, but all of the quarterbacks that are good in the nfl currently went 3rd or 4th round
Who in their right mind wants to say yes to the Sanders circus? No one I guess. I'm  shocked my Browns didnt take him. Being a circus is what they're best at.
respect for rich for sticking up for his guy
Sanders is a way better football player than J Manzel ,Baker Mayfield , trevor Lawrence
Im just gonna say this how the hell did cleveland not pick shedur they litterally went out and got watson and his bs  and lack of nfl ability after not playing cleveland needed to get shedur to build for the future or even jaxonville to pair with travis hunter and hunter had drama before the draft  and went number 2 this was targeted
Rich needs to accept that the QB position is different.  Teams will gamble on "red flags" with a position where it's necessary to have 3-5+ guys ready at that position on any given day.  At QB, you need one guy and only one guy.  Everyone else at that position on the team is there in a support role.  Clearly, teams question whether or not Sanders can handle a support role.
Saskatchewan Rough riders choose Shedeur Sanders first in the 2025 draft.
I never saw four so analysts afraid to admit the obvious truth. Even Stevie Wonder can see that teams don't want him and his father's 24/7 circus inside of their buildings. Why can't the NFL send a message? They had no problem sending pre-draft messages as to where he wanted to go, etc. It's not racism. It's karma.
If his last name was Jones. No one would care
People are over looking some obvious reasons why he fell out of the first three rounds of the draft. First, he decided not to interview with many teams. Two, some of the interviews he did have were called failed Interviews.   So why blame teams who didn't get to Interview him not pick him?  By limiting the information you gave these teams you can't expect those teams to use high draft capital to now select you when they have a ton of information on players who the organization did Interview and compile research data on. Look at it outside of football.....how many employers are going to offer you employment if you turned down interview opportunities?      Second, some of the Interviews he did have went bad so you can't blame these teams for not drafting you. Especially when those teams had  needs other than QB? That is a no brainer, GMs are going to draft players they believe can possibly help their team especially if they may loose their job if they fail in their draft process.    Now a team who you decided not to interview with and that team has no needs requiring to be addressed they may be more willing to gamble some draft capital and take him in rounds where the drafted player usually will get a few years to demonstrate they belong on the team.  Later round picks where they fail to convince the team to keep them on the roster simply get cut. By refusing to interview,  having  some bad Interviews, and the potential for daddy drama in social media you seriously limit the options of getting drafted in early rounds.
They’re creating a villain. Watch out
Sports media groomed shedeur to be a top five pick and now that it hasn't happened want to blame the nfl for having a steady grade on him as a fifth round pick. smh
This is called owners trying to buck breaking, which their father know exactly what the owners are doing. Yall on this panel talking about beggggggging man please!
MEMO, BREAKING NEWS: the son of Sanders AINT Deion Sanders.
This is a buck breaking
He just aint very good guys i told ya bunchrs he is less than Brock Purdy watch film geeze
drafting man owl Jamarcus Russell and the other guys didn't come with their father in position to come take your job. We watched 32 teams skip over shadeur out of fear for drafting the guy who's father all fire you when hired.
Remember the Golden Rule - They who have the gold make the rules.
Shedeur ain't no Allen or Mahomes, but he will get hes call and will have a opportunity to be great keep your head up young man!
Rich is right
I hope the Jets draft Sanders for peak Rich content. 😂
I know I wouldn't draft that circus either. Because it's not just him. It's his dad and the Media Narrative as well, which would most likely chicken wing you into starting him, whether he's ready or not. Johnny Manziel 2.0 with a mad dad? No thanks.
By them doing this to the sanders everyone who's pick already still not being talk about the sanders still the center of attention 😂😂😂😂😂
Rich can't be objective about this. I'm sorry Rich, but you need to move on.
Everybody knows the good ole boys had that KP meeting about Shedduer, period! It's probably more about his dad than him😢
They haven't colluded to keep a player out of the league since Kaepernick. This man is not a criminal but clearly it's a crime to be confident
Klatt just be quiet💯
"Whe you're radio active you're radio active."  Sasquatch
It aint about color tho for sufe dnt bring that up
Some points have been made about teams drafting players with criminal records or suspect behavior yet they passed over Sanders.  People are missing the fact that those players who have checkered pasts have those pasts in their personal lives...NOT WITH NFL teams.  Sanders and his father clearly offended them prior to the draft and during the interview process to the point they were completely turned off...regardless of his ability.  I'm a Deion fan and love what he has accomplished with his son...but when you are going around acting like you are bigger than the NFL and any team or owner in it you are going to get shut down.  THAT'S what happened here.  Shedeur needs take off that stupid money sign necklace and get on the phone as one of these analysts said and start building bridges instead of burning them with some of NFL GMs that would have taken him already.
Self reflection? More like a concerted effort to humble him and his father
RASICM IS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE NFL …. THIS WAS A MESSAGE TO THE BLK COMMUNITY… CONFORM and Be BUCK BROKEN or we Won’t DRAFT YOU …
Shut out to Rich Eisen for being a day one friend and taking on the elephant in the room
They're afraid he might turn into a big mouth like his dad don't need divas. In the NFL anymore and he does have an attitude
They are publicly telling this young man to beg for a spot on a NFL team. This is slave mentality! This league will suffer.
RASICM IS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE NFL …. THIS WAS A MESSAGE TO THE BLK COMMUNITY… CONFORM and Be BUCK BROKEN or we Won’t DRAFT YOU …
Lol we not begging for shi at the end of the day those who hate finish last 😂😂😂
Teams don’t want a player with ego and drama…weird! Also pro tip, don’t call yourself legendary
It’s a lesson in humility somebody’s gotta teach it to him.
NFL is trying to screw Shedeur & the Sanders family! It’s PERSONAL!!! 😢  They “Kapernicked” him! 🤷🏾‍♂️
The Sanders Family likes to be biblical...the League is saying "You reap what you sow" Rich has zero objectivity on this subject...he will only cape for his boy.
Deon Sanders would be acting Like Lavar Ball use to act lol 😂😂😂😂
Sounds like Shaqer is a real jerk may go undrafted.
That guy in blue thinking that S Sanders is gonna BEG??? And that he will be a good recruit? 😂😂😂
Oh no, it’s not Shedeur’s fault, oh no, it’s everyone else. 🥴
I like Dion and he was a great player. But he runs Animal House as a HC. The kid isn't that good in the first place and obviously he's been way too entitled. Just surprised that 32 teams finally decided to draw the line.
All ima say is. There is a difference between white people & white folks..
My opinion. I think nobody wants to draft him because. If take him! His dad is coming with him. Too much baggage.
Maybe the media is the one that needs to self reflect. The kids been so over hyped it isn't even funny. He's got bust and distraction written all over him...
Girly man Rich Eisen and crew.  32 teams from the richest organization on earth evaluated him based on what he did and said.  And now we see the results.  Ain't no mystery.  He did what he did. He said what he said.
A legendary bust
Call it like it is Rich, this is Personal!
That guy interrupted Eisen…. is he crazy? Bad TV.
Rich is right. This is absolutely personal. They've taken players that have killed people but his personality is this bad? Like, come the league has come together for this.
Keep talking, you know your not helping him. Be part of the problem or part of the solution.
Shedeur is being fed some NFL humble pie.
The  very fact that the story is more about Shedeur not being drafted and not about who was drafted. Gives you a taste on how big of a distraction having him as a backup will be.
The REAL story is that Shedeur Sanders IS NOT THAT GOOD. Sports commentators grossly over-hyped his NFL prospects. I watched a small sample of his film and he looked liked a talented high school player - not and NFL QB. Most sports commentary has been FAKE NEWS.
Has the Steeler fan the reason I think that he hasn't been picked yet he cannot push the ball down the field he doesn't have the arm strength to do that for the Steelers.
Don’t beg. Keep working
Some of these organization are embarrassing themselves. There are some teams that don’t need a quarterback. I don’t fault them.  I fault the teams like the Browns, Steelers, and the ones that obviously have nothing to lose and everything to gain.   The guy in the blue suit literally wants him to beg to be drafted. Gtfoh.
Point is Shadueur not that good.
Bottom line: The league is afraid of Sanders. Talk about distraction. This draft is forever going to be overshadowed because of this disgusting display of personal hate. Somehow the blame will be the family 🤦🏾‍♂️
In no world do you think shough, gabriel, or milroe or dart is better than sanders. They just dont like his dad. All the beat QBs had confidence that came off as cocky
Y’all full of ish, that kid is good! You want him to crawl to them and beg for a position? We know what this league is. Remember Kaepernick won a settlement for their BS. You spineless clowns just won’t call it what it is.
This is turning into Bronny levels of annoying. If not for his daddy, nobody would care.
Johnny Manziel was a trainwreck! They made a way for him. This is b.s
Humble is a bunch of bullet crab. They overlooked him purposely. They weren't humble. Why should he be humble?
Things could be worse.  What if his father was Shannon Sharpe?  BTW, Rich Eisen still wouldn't tell us the truth.
Just play along to get along...tell us what you really think RICH!
I hope this fuels him, because this is not about his talent.
Sanders is going to the Jacksonville Jaguars
Everyone is guessing lol
He doesn't need to beg anybody for a job. And I hope him and his father stand there ground
His arrogance is why NFL franchises won’t touch him with a 10ft. pole. Plus, he’s actually not that good and thee definition of overhyped. The dude has been served with a huge slice of humble pie 🥧
Honestly I think it is personal at this point because there's clearly lesser qbs being taken over him now.
"Hey, we built this guy up and the NFL has regected us, the media."  "There must be some ulterior motive as to why the NFL hasn't drafted Sanders since we are never wrong."  -The media.
Draft that dude and and you have to deal with Coach Deion.
Blackballing teams lessens trade value.
cause nfl execs/gm's are idiot sycophants for neon deion.
I'm completely tired of hearing about Sanders. I've never seen a draft where the coverage for the most part was for one player... and he wasn't even drafted. What are we doing?
They’re going to use these video clips of when everyone doubted him in future marketing and documentaries. He’s going to be alright if he never get’s drafted.
A bad interview drops you from #2 to UDF?
It's one thing to not like Shedeur, koo. But you can't make Jaxson Dart who he isn't because you don't like Shedeur lol.
I hope this makes him great
I wouldn't mind being in Shadeur Sanders shoes. Whether he's drafted or not he'll never have to work a day in his life. 🤷🏾
Teams didn’t want his brother in the locker room everyday filming him.
Talent, play on the field, how well you did the interviews, having a dad that you know will interfere any way he can when you try building and managing a football team, need for a qb. These are all things that affect the decision when drafting a qb. You can't really boil it down to 1 reason and certainly not something as stupid as racism. Teams did the cost/benefit analysis and it's just not worth it for teams to draft him. Sorry conspiracy clowns, usually there is a logical reason to a lot of things.
Father & son have the potential to get a coach or GM fired  (Rodgers style)  if things go belly up with him in the team. Why take the risk to your own career.
He doesn’t need to be begging for scraps. This says a lot about this guy 🤦🏾‍♂️.
I've been watching Rich's friendship with Deion color his narrative of the Sanders situation. He needs to take a step back.
No way that QB shouldn’t have been drafted. This is getting close to black balled. What did Prime do, check a scout? Also, why aren’t the Colorado skill players getting drafted? Those guys can play. Go get ‘em Chiefs.
I don't care for Sanders but he should've been drafted. This NFL has drafted 1,2 and or top 10 that are nowhere to be found and have been troublemakers.  It's just weird
For the people crying about sander didn't get drafted, he and his dad told the NFL teams not to draft him, so what is the big deal?!?! Stop crying!
Stevie Wonder could see what's  going on ....
You gone get ALOT of Hate For what you said Rich but you a STAND UP GUY BRO it’s right and wrong plain and simple. We know it’s bs but it’s the world we used to it. The Balls The James The Sanders whose next??
Shedeur is more of a potential liability than a potential asset.
Rich is just one step below Mel Kiper with blind love of shedeur
Everyone acting like the bad interviews, not showing for the combine, and duckin every GM outside the top 5 has nothing to do with it
So he should BEG?
Dude played daddy ball his whole career 🤷🏿‍♂️
I'm a bigger Rich Eisen fan now. Thanks for being ten toes down for your friend Dion Sanders and his family.
His dad is the baggage - he gave his kid a HOF jacket before playing a real football game at a high level and he apparently treated what few interested teams he had poorly - get an AGENT and bench dad
teams didnt want to hear all the whining that would be in thier future if they drafted him and daddy
Shedeur is not a backup. Stop.  It's plain upon tables.
If you haven't even finishd the college season, and you've already dictated which teams you won't play for (or allow your son to), you've already started off on the wrong foot.
No one is “entitled” to anything. Rich crying saying any organization should control their locker room. What the fool doesn’t realize is organizations control their locker room by finding the right mix of people to be in that locker room. There’s a lot of extra BS that as a coach I don’t blame teams for not wanting in their room. Listening to Deon who has his hands too deep in everything saying there’s teams where his kid will not be allowed to go to, hell why would you want to even risk that drama. I’d go find people willing to play. It’s a grown man’s game not playing all the spoiled kid bs where daddy wants to manipulate everything.
Coach Sanders killed his son’s draft stock when he went prime time and didn’t stay out of the picture
If his last name wasn't Sanders, would we even be talking about a 13-12 QB from Colorado?
TRAVIS KELCE AND TAYLOR SWIFT BEING BOMBARDED (MEDIA ATTENTION) IN OUR FACES GREEEEAAAATTTTTTT. A competitive athlete bring media attention to himself for the LOVE of the game   NFL: GET THAT SHXT TF OUTTA HERE😂😂😂
I’d imagine SS has spent his entire life hearing from Deion how great he is. Coming from his father, I don’t fault Deion for that but I also think SS has zero humility and just expects these billion dollar franchises to ignore his arrogance. There’s always a bigger dog
Sanders is so toxic, nobody wants to bring that in their clubhouse.  The fact that his people are out there playing the race card already just reinforces his toxicity.
Johnny Manziel went 1st overall and he won the Heisman on cocaine and alcohol! I’m not a fan of Shadeur but this is ridiculous. He should have gone by nown
This was a great conversation, str8 no chaser. All perspectives taken into account. Bigg up much appreciated guys! ✊🏽
🍭 🍭 🍭
His golden sky daddy bling brash arrogant attitude is what no team wants. Nor do they want his real daddy in their office or media talking.
He don’t have to beg for crap
What it simply is, "Stay in your place boy".
Shedeur will get picked yet. Let him eat some humble pie first. It'll be a good lesson for him and everyone else also.
No, Shadeur in my opinion is a 2nd round pick. Been saying that. His Daddy runnin his mouth is part of this problem also. Good for the NFL, way to stand up and put a stop to them both running  their mouths. Shadeur. Told them not to draft him if they don't want to turn their program around. Well you told em not to
Teams know he is un-coachable. He doesn't take in information well from people that are not his father.   It's a theme that followed him in college and was buried by the hype. Seems it wasn't just a theme, but a huge flaw.
The Travis Hunter comparison is relevant. Shedeur is being targeted.....
Y’all want him to beg Stop it
Not sure what all the fus is about Sanders not being drafted. He's fragile and makes decisions in the games I've seen of him. At best He's 3 or 4th round material. The game VS BYU, I thought the pro prospect was BYU Qb, Jake Retzlaff! If Deoin wasn't his Dad and coach there'd be no hype at all about him.
Shadeur is average.. how is he considered better dillon gabriel or will howard lol the dude threw laterals predominantly lol
Definitely Personal!  No way a QB ranked 217 is picked before a QB ranked at 35.  Shadeur now becomes the angry player with a chip on his shoulder!  Hopefully, he does a Tom Brady and allows his diss to spark him to raise up his game to a super high level.
Do you want an arrogant leader on your team that doesn't care about anyone else? - No.  Do you want a guy walking around saying, "Legendary." - No.  Do you want to be judged every time you don't start him? - No.  Do you want a clown show like Tebow? - No.  Do you want Deion thinking he owns your organization? - No.
I use to enjoy Rich E, but this slobber feast of the sub par Colorado QB, is deplorable. Rich is no longer watchable and has been declining for a while. This dude has always been mediocre,  not horrible but not good.  He's right where his talent deserves,  and his arrogant  showboating and his dad are a net negative,  I strongly appreciate the courage to not draft an overrated problem.
That’s the truth it’s personal and y’all know it
Shedeur and his Daddy are Toxic, to the NFL. Arrogant and Entitled !
theres at least 3 teams that should have taken Sanders, period.
I love Rich and that he's always the diplomat, but comparing the Deion presence thing with Hunter vs. his own son? C'mon Rich.
New Zealand is where I live.  Loved Dieon as a player and believed in him as a coach.  Was able to get all the Colorado Buffaloes games for the last 2 years and can give my honest opinion.  Shedeur Ssnders is a 3d round talent at best.  Yeah, he'll come with baggage, but if he had the chops his Dad thinks he has he'd have gone in the 1st round.  He's not a "franchise" level qb.  That's just a fact.  You don't build a team around his talent because he doesn't merit that treatment.  NFL talent evaluators aren't stupid or biased against anyone for anything except production.  To think it has anything other to do with means you didn't see him enough.  Shedeur reminded me more of Johnny Manziel than Jalen Hurts or Josh Allen.  And his arm isn't anywhere near as good a Manziel's.  That's my ruthless assessment.  I'm not a hater.  I'm a realist.  Shedeur as it stands has a skillset better exploited in the CFL than the NFL.
No head coach wants to draft a player in which the father of that player will automatically be in the conversation to take his job.  🤷
this just got VERY interesting. so the remaining picks at QB are supposed to think of themselves as only backups (and make a very good living and a lot of money at it, mind you) and NOT have the confidence to ever think about being a starter or wanting to be one? so was shedeur supposed to NOT be confident in himself and NOT want to be starter?
The Sanders Media Team like we bout to make so much money 😂😂
The entire thing really showed there hand Y’all trying to buck brake him
Think about it.... if Deion Sanders came to the NFL where would he want to coach?..... wherever his son is! I know if I was a coach and I would be hesitant to draft him knowing that Daddy was there waiting for me to lose my job.
It's ridiculous to think this is somehow teams just trying to put Sanders or his father "in their place" or whatever. Sanders needs a lot of work. There is NO doubt he's a spoiled kid. He blames his teammates all the time. He's never had a coach who isn't his father (you might fact check me on that one). He's 5th or 6th round, at best. And he probably will need to sit the first year, at least. I just know the first time a coach treats him like an adult, he's gonna throw a tantrum.
One team mentioned twice.  New England.  As a Patriots fan I’m glad to hear it.  I thought it was a great draft for them (trade down out of 77 probably a mistake, but made the best of it).  But you know how fans are - like me… rose colored glasses at the draft.  So, am I deluding myself thinking this was a good draft?   I’m glad to hear these guys think the Patriots nailed it.  I agree.  No one is perfect.  T-rex Campbell.  Henderson may struggle in traffic.  Walker needs to bone up on his routes.  Wilson may be the cleanest… but a mere center, trying to unseat Bradbury.  No perfect picks here.  So, maybe I’m delusional thinking this is a great haul.   So, it’s nice to see these guys agree.  If I’m wrong, I’m in good company.  Lol.  This looks like a home run draft for the Patriots.  And the botched trade down which they managed to salvage gives them three picks in the 5th.  The 5th starts to get to roulette wheel territory.  But occasionally a 5th or even a 6th hits.  So, three in the fifth… Pats may well find ONE diamond in the rough there.  Point being, they’ve already had a great draft, and they may not be done yet.  They could land a real unpolished find in the 5th due to their number of picks.    Arguably… and it is arguable, I admit, given that NONE of their picks are flawless… Patriots may have had the best draft.  After a strong FA.  Which team had a better off-season.  Maybe the Bears?   But do they have a reliable QB?  Caleb fell pretty flat last year.  But maybe that was because of what he was surrounded with?  But maybe not.  So, I’d still rather be the Patriots, with Maye.  So, the Bears may have added more/better pieces than the Patriots did, but the Patriots are still better positioned.  So, it’s debatable which team had the better off-season.  And even if you give it to the Bears, fine… Patriots are still a not too distant second.  Great FA, but left a lot on the table offensively.  They’ve addressed almost all of that in the draft.  Still need a LG, but may be too late now.  So, I’m not saying they’re perfect.  Patriots aren’t going to the Super Bowl.  They won’t even unseat the Bills in the East.  Hell, they’ll be lucky if they can scrap their way to the last wild card spot.  They’re not even a clear playoff team.  But they’re at least competitive.  And after a three win season (win four doesn’t count)?   This is probably the most improved team in the NFL.  Probably.  We’ll need to see what Diggs has left.  We’ll need to see how our picks pan out.  It’s not a lock.  But very probably, the most improved team in the NFL.  Remember too, I’ve only mentioned the players.  Is there any doubt that this coaching staff is a massive step up from last year?
Thank Rich league takes criminals and drunks but not cocky and confident quarterback
NO BEGGING...GTFOH
So he needs to be humble black man huh no confidence
These guys are up in the night. Shadeur sucks. I watched BYU shred Colorado in the bowl game, and it's all at the feet of the QB.
I think New England should take Shedeur Sanders
They called this buck breaking
Who’s Deion Sanders?
The hit job on another Black QB is almost complete with the 2025 draft ending near.
Legendary!!! 😂
You know it's bad when you have to try to find answers.
No one wants the deion drama.
Rich is too bias towards Sanders
I think certain coaches and GMs don't want Shedeur because they might lose their job as Deion has been doing a great job at Colorado. Who knows. Let's him, Shedeur live up to the hype.
I've lost a lot of respect for Eisen after this reaction.  Pathetic.
Yeah who else got picked today??? Jesus let it go sadeur ain't that good!
Bad example of rich using the Steelers for reigning in players.
Rich Eisen as a Browns fan… you now have a lifelong fan out of me!
The big deal isn't about Sanders not being drafted, he'll be in the league. Its about him not getting the  glory of a 1st round pick. The media whining about this mild inconvenience is the whole reason why it went like this. He can wait. He'll be fine. Nbd
Every time they played someone good, they lost. That's all it is.
Love Rich! But he's coming across as a company man coping for one of the league greats!
It’s always collusion isn’t it like all 32 teams are colluding against Deion Sanders to keep his son from being drafted get real the kid just isn’t that good he’s not NFL ready and he comes with a lot of baggage. Nobody’s gonna wanna deal with Dion if they have to bench his son. No one‘s gonna wanna have to deal with Dion and be forced to put his son on the field when he’s not ready or when he hasn’t earned it, everybody knows what comes with this dealand that’s Deion Sanders and nobody wants that distraction
Sanders is being blackballed. Trying to “humble” him with public humiliation is diabolical. Its obvious It’s personal
Shedeur Sanders is being black ball by the NFL.  Shedeur Sanders is being black ball by the NFL and everyone can see it. Shedeur  Sanders is a good quarterback. There is  some type of coordination going on by the NFL teams against  Shedeur Sanders.  Don’t worry Shedeur  god will fight your battle against these devils. I’m done watching the NFL.
Deon should have invested some of his fortune on good schools for his kids.
The NFL needs 4 more teams.  They have too few teams, so they behave like a Monopoly.   They haven't had an expansion team in 35 years - depsite doubling their viewership.  This is half of the reason why players careers have situations like Sanders
Im tired of this "he needs to be humble" narrative
Teams don’t want to deal with the Sanders Entourage after every single game.Hell, I even doubt his dad can or will keep quiet about training or the perfomance of other team mates.  Also, perhaps more important, the young man must have had some appalingly bad team interviews. Confidence is fine. Arrogance in public annoys some people, sure. BUT sitting at a table ALONE with a GM and coach of an NFL team. and still have zero humility is bad. It just screams immaturity and poor attitude.  I wasn’t at the team interviews (obviously) but it’s a guess at what has happend.
I was told he told KC that he wanted to go there and Mahomey can back him up.
Rich Eisen has really become a corporate shill.  Whatever narrative his overseers bring up, Rich Eisen will push it.  Would Rich Eisen spend money (tens or hundreds of millions of dollars) out of his own pocket to deal with someone that thinks they are entitled before they ever played a snap for him?  Would Rich Eisen want to hear Deion Sanders chirping on social media if/when things didn't go right for his kid?    Rich has really become an out of touch corporate sell out.  He is blaming NFL teams for the attitude of Shedeurs and the input of Deion Sanders.  It's like hiring a DEI candidate that will have you walking on eggshells, meanwhile, you're the boss that's paying his salary.  Never forget about Daddy Sanders and his mouth too.  Unbelievable.  🤦‍♂
It's probably far off track....but when Sanders is drafted, you're also drafting his dad "Prime... As said off track.
32 teams. This ain't personal. Are all 32 teams wrong? I don't think the interviews with Sanders were a red flag. I think they were a train wreck.
It is weird seeing people mad about teams wanting to pick other players, like he is owed a spot because they like him and or his dad.
First mistake was not attending the draft in person. Wanted to do his own thing and that does not fly in the NFL especially as a QB.
Same people hating on Shadeur & Prime voted for Trump and swear he's doing a great job 🤦🏾‍♂️ they'll disrespect Rich Eisen for telling the truth. See comments.
The teams dont owe it to the sanders family or any other player to draft them. If they choose to not mess with you then thats their prerogative. No matter who anyone thinks is better or worse. He shouldve came into the process humble and with a willingness to sell his services. Its a job interview after all and not apperantly interviewing well or participating in any pre draft workouts hurt him. Dude over estimated his value. Simple. If he gets drafted or not leave that shitty attitude elsewhere and get to work. Wish him the best though
He’s about to be the best QB in the XFL
Hey, if he gets drafted in the seventh, he still gets his shot (cough! Brock Purdy!) he just needs to be ready when that shot comes. Some needy coach will take a gamble on him. And I wish him luck.
Draft coverage starts at 11:35
Name one receiver on the patriots 😭
I never really lot about it. Deion did say he would control where Shedeur went. He also said he would only go the the NFL to coach his son. Why would a coach or GM sign off on Shedeur when the media and social media will be calling for Deion to take the head coaching job. Nobody wants that drama on top of trying to compete weekly in the NFL.
Rich is best friends with Deon. His take is biased
Why on earth should a player with the skill set have to Beg for anything when the skill set speaks for itself. Why Beg when he has earned it. Grown men projecting hate for a youngman who has worked his entire life for this earned position. This is so very sad for the ENTIRE NFL OWNERS has this mindset.
My New Orleans Saints 🤷🤷🤷Derek Carr sucks
When you have an attitude that no team wants is a you thing. Doesn’t help he is already a high profile player.
There is a reason NE didn''t keep Cam Newton as a backup.
This is straight up "blackball." I don't care how you slice it. 😏
The NFL is a joke, they will pick players with sexual misconduct charges, DUIs but refuse a player because he's arrogant.
“Legendary”
Come on, the franchises control the cameras and the message.  If some second string quarterback becomes responsible for a franchise message, who wants that?  Of course the teams stay away.
32 teams showed all yall. Nobody tells them who to draft.
NFL teams are Teaching Shedeur a lesson...We will decide where U go , not you...
He will get drafted after all this media on him now
I WILL NOT WATCH NFL NO MORE AND BET YOU ALOT OF SALES ARE GOING TO FALL WATCH. They suck
He should beg! Like every other player for the last hundred years.  This is exactly the problem.
Some people are acting like normal fair, when in fact this is a literal first in NFL History…  Never have these set of circumstances ever occurred before, with the myriad of facets involved…  Rich Eisen analysis of the situation is spot on, making more sense than these clueless league apologists…  People forget what college quarterbacks like Warren Moon and Tony Dungy experienced, when their talents were misevaluated…  Tom Brady, and Brock Purdy too…  🤔
Beg??
THE NFL SUCKS
Oh Rich this is really poor, Ilove him but this is clearly very personal for him and its showing in his analysis. If you can't understand how Sanders would bring drama to your franchise that you don't need i think you're either not understanding the thing you've covered for my whole life or your feelings for Dion are affecting your judgement.
Call the GM’s and beg? Haha. But they aren’t trying to teach him a lesson…..right
They want him to beg
🤷🏻‍♂️ It's over. No team wants a backup QB with a media show behind him. Feel really sorry for the boy - he doesn't deserve this. Collusion is definitely part of this, a chance to humble this family and their impact on the league.  Praying for Shedeur, just wish he didn't film everything in the build up to this draft, and behind the scenes even now... reacting to not being picked.  Damn, this sucks. talent alone he should be on a team. surely?  Legendary this is NOT - what a shame.
Rich just answered his own question… “which draft FIT the team” that’s why he’s still on the board he don’t FIT a teams vision sorry unlike the NBA nepotism don’t work on the grid iron
CFL needs players too. He has options.
Shedeur got a wake-up call. Not as good as his daddy... Too Cocky Too Arrogant and not that great a player.
I had a 5th round grade on Sanders so I’m not surprised one bit.
The NFL is disrespecting Colorado not just  Shedeur. Its disrespecting its HOF’er Sanders. Sanders gives thanks to God maybe thats the problem?
I honestly believe that Dion having been such a great player and knowing the landscape would support the organisation his son went to and know that his son would be in good hands!!
Some have said on Radio Sport talk....with The NIL $$$ just maybe he thinks he has enough $$$ to be comfortable, and doesn't want to go thru the grind each and every day....Lost and just doesn't want Football right now...time will tell
Maybe don’t be a primadonna and tell certain teams you won’t play for them.
Dallas drafting Shedeur would be amazing and you know Jerry just might. I mean how much attention would that bring?
Politics
Rich Eisen damaged his own credibility with that “elephant?  What elephant?” routine.
Travis hunter was the #1 player in his high school class, shedeur wasn't close to that
This kid tries to create the narrative himself.  So even if the organization stops the media, this kid is addicted to social media and will put his own story out there.  It doesn’t work for teamwork, it’s just a new problem that this kid escalates to the largest stage.
"Asked by Patrick if there were any teams he wouldn't want Shedeur to play for, Deion said there are "a lot of teams" that fit the bill"
Lawyer Up!
Some of the best players ever went day 3 and later.
Baker Mayfield, Johnny Manziel… stop saying he has bad character that’s bull
Y'all keep saying "if it wasn't for his dad, this wouldn't have happened". Stop it, it wasnt for his dad, he'd never been considered in the first place. He'd go completely undrafted. Stop making up fake narratives
I’d love to see Shadeur go to the Rams 🐏 under Sean and learn off Stafford and he’s built for the West Coast ??🏈
It certainly seems like the league has decided 2 things. #1 Shedeur is too entitled, and they don't want Deion involved at all. #2 They don't think he's good The league is definitely trying to humble the Sanders family
Sorry rich, you don't get to have it both ways. Deion Sanders all but said he was going to be an influence wherever his son went, and analysts have been going on Non-Stop about how Deion's attitude helped make him the success he was and how uncompromising and Savvy and what a showman he is  Dude doesn't even really trust anybody else to coach his kid properly.  So when teams might be understandably worried that his influence might compromise what they try to do you don't get to say "oh well you just run your organization the way you want and it will be fine"
If Will Johnson and Shavon Revel can overcome their injury history, the Cards and Cowboys got steals in the draft. Ravens obviously with Mike Green but those allegations are not going away.
have we seen anything like this before?
Teams don't want another Angel Reese, they want a leader not a social media star.
I get what Joel says 3/4 of the way in to this clip. When he said at this point in the draft, bringing in Sheduer as a back up with all that distraction and superstar status would be maybe something that the teams are shying away from. But i would push back slightly and say if teams were worried about doing that in a back up role, then why not draft him in the 1st or 2nd round and have him in a clear situation where he's your future starter. I'm with Rich, where he's laying out examples and thoughts of the league doing one thing one minute and then the opposite for another player. I think a team is going to draft Sheduer rounds 4 or 5 and he will have a first few seasons akin to Brock Purdy and go from a late round pick (in Purdy's case Mr Irrelevant) to a bumper 2nd contract. Now in Purdys case we don't yet know the exact numbers in his new contract but its just an example. Sheduer is closer to Lamar level but being drafted at Purdy's level, so someone somewhere is getting a superstar at a bargain draft position
Much Shedeur about nothing...
When you draft Shedeur you're also getting Deione
Jacksonville will take him tomorrow
Who is holding his hands over players to not hurt themselves? This cam BS destroys so much!
The NFL IS TRASH
The biggest problems with him could come if he actually did work out as good enough to warrant a contract, not just that he wasnt good enough to be a must have.  Its easy enough to shut him out and offload as a reserve if he gets chippy/disruptive, but if he did become valuable hanging on to him would become a nightmare, doubly so if his dad gets an NFL job. Teams are already seeing the problems with mediocre QB contracts, and big stars with strong PR holding out / demanding trades etc ..... the Sanders have the biggest red flags for that in history. Eisens over reactions and Sanders pandering (as with Rodgers) is a great example of why teams are leary, the over hype and narrative control Sanders brings is on full display here. No owner or GM is taking that, and it sends a wider message to a league about where the power lies......although it does really make the Stealers look ever more ridiculous for their Rodgers pandering its another example of why teams dont want a QB who thinks they are bigger than the team, even if they are.
I think its pretty simple: Teams done see Sheduer as a QB1 and no teams want the media or PR headache that comes with making him rheir QB2
I feel like they are making a sad point all together.. wrong man maybe just a bad theory as well
The NFL is a big Joke.
Rich, you’re getting way too emotionally charged on this …
Your talent is the selling point. These guys are talking out of their asses trying to explain him not being picked, so it's personal, leave it at that!
Maybe this is God taking a sledgehammer to Shedeur's ego.
He was overhyped and teams don’t want the media circus distractions and scrutiny from his dad. It’s as simple as that.
Stage Father issues
Waiting to hear a black guy to address his arrogance…
Explained the real reason Shedeur has not been picked; the combination of Talent Over Everything (ie; Vincent "Bo" Jackson, a unicorn 1 of 1 player)T.O.E; which Shedeur is not; but primarily this institution (NFL) is status quo and will forever remain this way --and SIMPLY REFUSES TO LET A BLACK MAN BE ABOVE THE NARRATIVE (HAVE ALL THAT POWER "SWAG, MONEY, CONTROL") as one famous former NFL player said "If you don't want to humble yourself; then we'll do it for you; it's what the ole folks call "putting a Black man in his place." Anymore questions you can take my class. 444 Cross-Cultural Communication
Rich is right about the teams taking people that should probably be locked up and ignoring  people who lead their lives right. The NFL and Colleges protect people, as they do a job on the field,  because that could cost them money if they treated them the way anybody else would be treated. And I'm not talking about Shedeur here...I'm talking across the board. It's been going on for decades.
There have been so many players with so much bigger red flags that were drafted in the first round lol
How about maybe Shedeur Sanders isn't good enough to play QB in the NFL!? 😮
Why should he beg the GMs?
I think it’s absolutely personal. It’s not against the kid but about who his dad is and all that potential drama
When your Daddy tells the world your don will only play for certain teams was the Nail in the coffin. Then when your son follows though on your comments Sealed that coffin shut. Weep what you sow. How come you aint talking now Deion....cmon Mr Cheerleader Coach...no takers in 1,2,3 rounds.. Nothing , no comments big mouth. Maybe you can retire another Jersey for ZERO ACCOMPLISHMENTS . This is on the Sanders Family , plain and simple.
At this point I'll be surprised if he gets drafted
Maybe he should find a team to run bubble screens like they did all the time at Colorado. Shadeur isn't that good.
This is how villains are made 😂😂😂😂
Very stupid to talk about his tweet. You don’t draft the young man and he thanks God to keep himself humbled and that’s something you want to bring up like the league is taking that personally. He is better than half the QBs selected above him.
he mustve had atrocious interviews to go back & try to apologize & resell himself now i think he went in so arrogant & rich kid in those interviews..the whole process..they passed the QB position is more than talent..its leadership..its high IQ..its galvanizing the troops ok shedeur is me me me..& that's deion's fault..this isnt the 80s prime time draft..times change
Listen, I’ve been no fan of Deion his whole career. His ego and loud boasting always just rubbed me wrong. His son seems to display similar traits, but I know much less about him than his dad so I’m not totally sure that’s his true attitude. Having said that, it’s INSANE to me that he’s still undrafted. As bad as the QB situation is for a handful of teams out there, I can’t fathom none of them picking him up in the 3rd round. Idk if he’s gonna be a hit or a bust, but I know for sure that the QB a few teams have on the roster right now stinks and is likely actually worse than what he will ever be.
Beg!!!!
Raiders draft him in fourth round today
Deion Sanders has never carried himself like Lavar Ball. He always credits the expertise of other coaches. He trusts his son's judgement. So knock it off with the crap about Deion being a helicopter Dad. This was just hate plain and simple. Like Deion isn't a respected hall of famer. Like he isnt a man of upstanding moral character. This is hate, plajn and simple. Same one's calling Shedeur arrogant, were the same ones hanging off of Nohnny Manzell's jock strap! FOH!
Rich is really too emotional on this - Deon’s your boy, we get it
A QB needs to be a team leader; the NFL  has doubts about Sanders
This is a humiliation ritual. He will not be drafted. The NFL is attempting to BUCK BREAK Shedeur.
No team wants to draft Shedeur and Deion Sanders.
On the strength of this, I might literally not watch the NFL this upcoming season
The NFL owners are dominantly Caucasian. They are sending this message to a Black player, and it is to know your place. Period.
It is your friend Prime! Come on! The kid can play but he's not good enough to overcome Prime's noise that he will bring to any team that picks him. Also what HC wants to be on the hot seat right away due to Prime wanting a NFL HC job to coach his kid. Hunter was way better! Rich you are delusional on this due to your relationship with Prime.
shedeur bought a new phone yesterday & only nfl coaches had the phone# someone pranked called him & pretended they were from the saints ok this means the nfl insiders..the teams..just really dont like him at all ok to play w/ his feelings on draft day like that..he did something bad ok
If he calls and beg ! 😢
Shedeur is just not that good and his interviews must have been awful. Remember, Travis Hunter is just as tied to Deion and he went #2. This is a Shedeur issue.
Klatt just be talking to hear himself
In truth, this draft class is RELATIVE once you move past Travis Hunter. What I mean is I  think the gap between the QB's in this class once you get past Ward is minimal in the grand scheme of things. So considering who his dad is and what kinds of "potential" baggage owners and orgs think might come with drafting this kid because of who his dad is and how his dad is always in the media and such then it makes sense why teams passed on him. If Sanders is like truly the number 2 QB, there's like 4 more QB's that are like 2A, 2B, 2C, etc. And when I say "2" i dont mean "2" as a high first round pick. So yeah, why draft him with all the stuff you "think" might come along with him when you can get a QB that is maybe just a hair lower (RELATIVELY). Also, these teams are owned by old white dudes. They don't like his dad. Liking his dad if we was playing for them when he was in his prime is one thing. But that's different.  And as far as the "red flag" comment goes, I love Rich, but this is a different kind of red flag. To be a first round O-Lineman who casual fans don't even know who might have failed two drug tests is a smaller red flag than a kid who's dad is Deion Sanders.  I also disagree with the dude on the show saying Shedeur needing to make some calls and basically "beg" teams to take him now. F-that.  I disagree with Rich about the Travis Hunter comparison as well. Again, I LOVE Rich, but Travis Hunter is a once in a generational maybe lifetime draft talent. Shedeur is NOT. This draft class is basically Travis... then everyone else. And that's not a bad thing. I'm just saying talent wise Travis is light years (relatively speaking) ahead of the rest of this year's class.
Beg for what n it's crazy cuz joe klatt went to colorado too but wants sheduer to beg smfh
deion prime time is a damn good players..analyst..now coach..he made travis & his son look good but these teams see something in travis..that they dont see in shedeur..& yes he botched the interviews he skipped the combine..someone will take him as 3rd string backup but..might as well just skip it all he should just go be a reality tv social media personality..his stock dropped too low..its not worth it now
The #2 NFL Draft pick Heisman trophy winner received passes his entire collage career from who again? Keep your head up Shedeur Sanders, you're getting the young Muhammed Ali treatment, that's all. Ali said he was the greatest and people took issue with it. Said he was arrogant, not humble etc. Cheered for him to fail or get knocked out because of his personality. He stayed true to his self, improving his craft, and his vision. He went through the fire, and now is respected by many as the greatest around the world. Stay focused, true to your genuine nature and become legendary if that's your vision.
Rich Eisen still writing a “victim “ narrative to explain away Shadeur’s ego trip. Woke broadcasting
It is absolutely personal …. A family disrespect because think about it if they thought he was marginal they wouldve drafted him and let him fail and his career wouldve been done !
Burgundy blazer I forget his name sounds like the owners who don’t like Shedeur. This shows they are scared of a young black man already financially empowered by his family name, and by his own talent, this is bullshit! I also think if they don’t pick him tomorrow or ““ today now the NFL needs to be boycotted.
Too much time has been spent talking about a player who's upside is Tua. If he wasn't famous nobody would have ever talked about him as a 1st round pick
Those guys like attention. I believe the owners must have boycotted the brothers. When he said he wasn't gonna go to the combine is when he messed up. Come on man, these guys are billionaires. They don't need him. Gotta hop off that horse you on and stop playing with God. You might get somewhere
Rich… shadeur sucks and has an awful personality. Dont let prime delude you
Rich…
Honestly, who cares!? This night is about several young men going into the NFL, I don't want to hear about Shedeur slipping. Give these other guys attention.
People will take players with red flags if they're talented enough to warrant it. Nobody wants red flags from a guy with marginal ability. How long an NFL career would a guy like Case Keenum or Kellen Moore have had? That's the level Sanders is, he's a guy who if he wants to have an NFL career is going to have to be the guy who is an hour early for meetings and last one to leave, Mr Yes Sir No Sir. He doesn't have the talent to get special treatment.
He should not have to beg.  Shedeur has earned the right to play in the NFL.  I will look at the NFL differently.
It’s coachability. Teams look at him see that he has been coach by his father all his career and he hasn’t had a different coach. Teams are looking at him and thinking if we draft him high and he can’t be coached by our current coach we will have to go out and get Deion. I feel for the kid but if he spent one season on a different team with a coach other than his dad he would of been a day one pick
He’s literally been playing football all his life. I don’t think he needs to get on the phone and have a conversation with anyone to say he’s about football. All his teammates have said how humble he is. Knowing your value and being humble is an attribute that many cannot balance, which is why people take Understanding your value as pride instead of self worth…he was literally mentored by Brady at one point….
nah rich youve gotta have a realistic unbiased take on this as if youre not friends w/ deion otherwise cant speak on it 'cause its not honest..there's no vendetta against the sanders ok these teams just wanna win..they watched the tape..they crunched the numbers..interviews they realized he's a spoiled rich kid..money signs just like johnny manziel..history repeats ok
It's really not that complicated, and to act like this is an NFL problem is insane.   The teams that need QBs are also some of the worst teams in the league. Those teams often have new or relatively new head coaches who have yet to establish themselves or earn the benefit of the doubt.  What happens to those guys when they don't IMMEDIATELY turn around their team? The media will stick microphones in Deion's face & inevitably the chatter will be about Deion replacing the HC next season.   Tell me, would YOU want to sign up for your inevitable replacement or the chorus of people in the media asking "should Deion Sanders coach the Browns/Jets/Panthers/Raiders next season?"   And literally eveyrone was saying next year's draft was deeper & more talented at QB, so if you want to tie your career to someone, why would you tie yourself to Deion & Shadeur? If you truly believe he's a franchise guy, maybe you do. But if you're confident you'll make it to next season, why not wait for better prospects?  Lastly, NONE OF US were sitting in those interviews. You can talk about talent all you want, but we do not know what he said & how he behaved in those meetings. We do know Deion said he wouldn't "let" certain teams draft him. Well guess what? Those teams listened.
2:51 is what I'm hung up on currently. sanders definitely has attitude concerns, had terrible interviews and rubs a lot of people the wrong way. But I can't say being an arrogant brat is worse than having multiple sexual assault allegations, yet mike green managed to get a second round pick
They’re skipping him because nobody likes him enough to make him their franchise QB and the circus element he comes with isn’t worth the headache for a backup. They’re taking other dudes to hold the clipboard whose dads aren’t going to flood the organization with negative nonsense
The NFL needs players NOT movie stars! It's absolutely hilarious to me that this nepo-baby (with very little convincing film AND who skipped pre-draft workouts) thought he would go 1st. STOP BELIEVING CONSPIRACIES!
Shedeur Sanders is an above average college quarterback. He said to a camera "It wasn't supposed to be this way." Shedeur Sanders has his branding with the dollar sign squared and the word "legendary" on his wall when he hasn't done anything close to legendary. If he wants to play in the NFL, he has to earn it - he doesn't get to be in because his HOF father says he should be.
Its social media, celebrity, his dad and his personal interviews.
no its not about deion..he's prime time..hall of famer..legend.. its bronny james..son is ultimately not ready..not fit for he pros bronny's dad lebron had to pick him for his team..no one else did bronny is undrafted..he's not ready..same here..dont blame deion
No teams wants the sanders reality show in their locker room.
Is Rich eisen on national TV on the NFL Network telling the whole world that every single one of the 32 organizations is racist😂 every single one of the 32 owners that comprise the organization that he works for oare somehow running a criminal scam😂 Rich eisen is a putz
They want him to beg.  He's not a tap dancer and they hate it, plus his last name is like royalty to a lot of ppl
Dude in purple shirt 👚 is a sanders HATER big time. He knows this is collusion
Thought Eisen was going to pull a "Kirk Herbstreit" and start crying about non-existent "racism" against "Show"deur Sanders!!! The "racecard" looks bad on you Rich!!!
It’s obvious this is collusion and the way you can tell, the d bag in the oriole is clearly being super defensive and no matter what anyone says, he has an answer to try and turn this back in Sheduer. Rich is right. You can have duis m, get arrested the day before the draft, accused of SA, beat your wife, get drunk in public, party all the time, speeding tickets, ect snd you still get drafted .  But not draft shedeur bc he isn’t humble? It’s a joke and it’s collusion and I’d be filing lawsuits and getting subpoenas to see the messages between owners.    You can’t defend this like the purple shirt guy unless you’re being paid to change the narrative away from collusion.   Your trying to say bc of social media or extra media presence they don’t want the best QB statistically and on tape in this draft without question, he isn’t being drafted but the have no issue taking the most thug gangsters out there. It’s collusion
oh keep in mind rich & deion are cool..worked together for years..his opinion is biased bottomline this is johnny manziel..this is RGIII..theyve seen the rich kid..the overrated especially for QB..they value that position so much..gotta be a leader..gotta be high IQ bro is not a leader..he inherited ball IQ from his dad..but the QB position..they cant risk it
great job guys!!! whew. lots to chew on there .
Pro scouts watched the BYU-Colorado film.
funny thing is at this point because the qb needy teams for the most part have their guys, sanders could go undrafted . . .  not saying it will happen, but it's a strange possibility
Sanders should have been force fed Jalen Hurts interview videos.
Who cares?...obviously he's not what teams want at the moment...move on
It’s obvious this is collusion and the way you can tell, the d bag in the oriole is clearly being super defensive and no matter what anyone says, he has an answer to try and turn this back in Sheduer.

SO LEGENDARY... LOL
Thank you Rich. The panel is full of sh*t. This is definitely personal.
What doesn't everyone understand, the head coach or gm doesn't want the press screaming everytime their qb misses a pass to put in sanders and you guarantee Deion is going to lobby that organization to get hired as the head coach.  Nobody is going to put extra stress on their life and a target in their back.
There is a very strong possibility he can go undrafted. Sad, it’s not about talent.
2:57preach
Deion should have kept his big mouth shut until after the draft.
Gotta be personality and how he performed in team interviews right?
Eisen is dead to me after that. Total baby diva suck up.
Teams don't want another Cam Newton arriving for a game wearing a dress.
I like Rich, but he LOVES to spread the conspiracy theories and then just plays the “that’s what people are saying. I’m not saying it.” card. He did it again in the segment.
I think teams are afraid prime will spout off about everything..
If the Raiders don’t grab them in the fourth, I’m done being a fan
when I went on any Job interview, I made sure to put my best foot forward because you NEVER get a second chance at a first impression. And I always got the job. With 4 felonies on record.. as an indictment on today's social media world, perception has become truth ask Jonathan Majors who can't get work in Hollywood after his accusation was proven false: LIFE SUCKS AND IT DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.
There is no way he should bag for a job in the NFL.
That conspiracy theory is just baseless and bad. Shame.
Why in the hell would he call GM’s and beg? They would rather draft a two time accused rapist. But teach a confident young man a lesson. That makes a lot of sense.
ALSO THAT LAST BOWL GAME VS BYU MAY HAVE PLAYED A HUGE PART
THEY SEEN AND KNOW SHEDEUR'S POTENTIAL, AS OF NOW IT'S STARTING TO LOOK PERSONAL.  THIS IS FOUL AND UNACCEPTABLE TO SCREW HIM OVER LIKE THIS AFTER BRAGGING ABOUT HOW HE COULD EVEN BE FIRST PICK . LOOKING BACK ON SOME YOU CHOOSE OVER HIM I DON'T SEE HOW I DON'T SEE HOW A FEW WERE DRAFTED. 😮😮😮😮
If a team honestly thought he could come in and help lift them up, lead as a leader and win he would have already been drafted. There are some people that are extremely skilled, but Lack leadership ability. An NFL quarterback has to be a leader and extremely skilled.
Sanders probably told teams what offense their running and how many hours Instagram will be in the locker room, nobody wants the circus 🎪
This story is still going to overshadow every other rookie
Didnt Aaron Hernandez write 32 letters to every GM promising to change his ways?   Fool me once
Teams know that drafting Sanders is a package deal with daddy. No one wants the circus.
The NFL intentionally made it their business to not draft shedeur which is BS!!! Quit letting people insult your intelligence!! This is PERSONAL!!
100% they’re getting back at Prime.
Looks like Sanders, father & son, are eating some long overdue HUMBLE PIE
Shedeur's father never taught him humility, and now NFL is collectively being a father figure to teach this young man a lesson.
This is going to be an legendary documentary for him because he will be legendary
i don't think it's personal that Shedeur is been passed for the draft, i believe team owners / managers / coaches want to be in control of their locker rooms and Shedeur, with all due respect, might require a lot of attention from a coach and might be uncontrollable because of he's big personality. an out of control locker room is gonna affect other team players and eventually the outcome of the season. as a coach i'll take a chance with Shedeur
He should have gone to another college WITHOUT his Dad.  That’s “Ridiculous” to follow your kids to college!  Who does that?
Bengals should take him cuz aint no way he gonna start over Burrow 😂
So Rich is saying that Mike Tomlinson does not know what he is doing.
6:13 he should beg...?
You guys are not making it any easier. With all the talk and hoopla that the media is putting on this kid,  what teams wants that??
This kid would be worth it just in jersey sales... This is CRAZY yo me!
I can't believe anyone who knows what they're talking about would have had him that high in their mock draft. I can only think they've not watched him play and just jumped on the hype train instead. I'm surprised he hasn't been picked after three rounds, but wasn't shocked he wasn't picked on day one.
5:40 what in the hell? Call back GMs that dont pick him? 😂😂😂 This dude
Deion ruined his son's chance at being drafted in his pro day when he it took over. Every HC, GM and owner in the league wouldn't want that headache, if it was just the media attention around Shaduer, I believe teams would've took a chance. But it will be Deion and Shaduer, and Deion could give masterclass on media engagement. Plus as HC of Colorado he will have cameras in his face, and we all know how protective he is of his son. We've seen it on Shaduer's pro day, and that plus Shaduer's own description of meetings with the teams, demonstrates how unprepared he was, and how oblivious he was to uniqueness of his background and father, and why that should've been front and center in their dealings with the press, and scouts, and especially teams. But it wasn't, and that's what has doomed him. Not his play, he's demonstrated he's good enough to play in the league. But to me, there is no upside to any team having Deion Sanders criticize every move they make that might upset his son. It's a lose/lose scenario.
If Shedur was a great qb, none of this wouldve mattered..NONE of it
This is like Trump winning the election all over again… the media created the narrative that he had no chance, not the people. Then when he got elected, the media was shocked and outraged.  The media created the narrative that Shedeur was a top 5 pick, not the people, and now, once again, they’re shocked and outraged.
Weak arm, can’t get the ball to the perimeter, holds ball too long… Russ Wilson went in the 4th as did Dak…
WTF are you talking about? calling teams and begging teams to draft you? WTF are you on Daniel?
You guys are not making it any easier. With all the talk and hoopla that the media is putting on this kid,  what teams wants that??
I;m normally a big Rich Eisen fan but are you kidding me???? Its because the LEAGUE as a collective is teaching the Sanders family a lesson??? Rich you sound like a flat earth earther even tolerating that kind of talk.
NFL isn’t sending a message to this kid or his dad. They’re sending a message to the media. The first time there’s controversy the media would fan the flames and be like a dog with a bone until it ruins the team. The sports media sucks.
Shedeur Sanders has the ultimate Little League Dad, and no franchise wants a part of that...
In college, Sanders never beat a team that finished in the top 20.
Shame on the NFL. This is most definitely personal. His agent better be doing deals across the board for this young man. Shedeur deserved to be in round 1 and 2.
We all know what this is. These analyst know what this is they just can't say it publicly. The fact they are suggesting for Shedeur to call and beg to be drafted is a control mechanism. This is about a young black man, that's right black man who they want to break and wrap around their finger but they can't. That's what this is about. I'm a Giants fan and the moment we choose Dart over Sanders I knew exactly what was about to happen
You can't have character issues and Deion interfering with your most important role on offense. He has to be a true leader. Look at Manziel, Leaf and many others who had character issues. No one wants that in a QB.
Cowboys is the best place for Shedeur. They could use a developmental QB.
Let's be completely honest. If his name were not Sanders none of these talking heads would bring him up more than just a passing phrase. I don't know why no one has drafted him. All I will say is maybe just maybe it's as simple as the NFL teams don't think he is as good as all his fans think he is. And if he has a bad attitude that would hurt him too. I'm willing to bet he has a entitled attitude. He is a kid that grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth with his dad being the only coach he has ever had. Its not some crazy conspiracy that the NFL teams just have it out for him. I think it's a combination of he isn't as good as the talking heads say, and the baggage that comes with him
I believe this is unfair treatment by NFL teams. His talent is way above many players chosen. I have seen too many players taken with character issues police records with less talent.
Bahaha
Rich clutching pearls over this is priceless. No one wants Deion calling every week or airing laundry or complaining on tv about them. It isn't Shadeur's fault, but he has baggage.
Sadly he understands bradymode on and off field  now
Cuz his dad got his ego to high thinking your not going to do any scouting combine work outs because you think your that good teams don’t look at it that way
I think Joel made a great point about how Tim Tebow, cam newton, and Colin kaepernick were not going to be well received as backups because of the media circus surrounding them. If they don’t think shedeur is an immediate starter, they sure as hell aren’t going to want him as a backup.
Eisen looks black.
So now they want him to gravel at their feet? That’s why Shedeur isn’t drafted. He’s a rich kid that doesn’t need money so he’s not kissing their asses
The brown are always missing out
What happens when you come into the draft cocky and arrogant
When Deion Said he won’t let Certain cities draft his guys LEGENDARY🚩🚩🚩
I rock wit Rich he know bull💩 when he smell it
Rich’s head is going to explode if Shedour doesn’t get drafted tomorrow 😆😆😆
Everyone says he’s arrogant, why because of the swag, the jewelry????? Crazy, he never did anything that says arrogant.
Deep reflection... Didn't Johnny Manziel go #1 and he was on Coke?? Okay lol.
At this point Shilo is getting drafted before Shadeur.
The Saints ACTUALLY used a 2nd Rd pick to draft a 25 y/o QB coming off FOUR MAJOR injuries in college and can't stay healthy. That is what incompetent GMs do, reach for players like Tyler Shough because of their "Feelings" and "Emotion 😂😂
Sheduer is talented . Period . Teams have made a big mistake. That’s fine Sheduer just be patient, you will get an opportunity and the coaches who passed on him will look foolish.
Shedeur is smaller than Brock Purdy.  That might have something to do with it.
Lol Hes not that good. Minimum physical traits and average outside the pocket. If he wasn't Deon's kid noone would care
Rich eisen invited to the cookout!!!
The Legendary stuff is a bit over the top for someone still in college.  Teams know that a reality show crew may come with him.
It’s all of Deion Sanders friends who are Mad that his son didn’t get drafted
Probably he was going to be drafted but was told not to go to those teams.
Ain't no begging. That man should have been drafted. We all know what it is
Never beg for nothing
Listening to Daniel Jeremiah speak from experience as an NFL scout tells you now that what these NFL executives uncertain people of a particular ethnicity want is for this young man to beg for something the tape demands that he should have already gotten it's a sad sad diatribe# NFL # Racism at its finest
I saw this coming towards the end of the season.  This is an example of how your family can hold you back.
If I'm Deion, I call Jerry Jones and ask for a favor. Dallas can handle media distractions. Or the Chiefs can grab him. Andy Reid can probably handle the noise around Sheduer.
Racism is alive and well obviously. Going back to Hockey now, take care Football.
We are experiencing a masterclass in collusion at work.  Completely, perfectly diabolical!!  I will be surprised if any Colorado player besides Travis gets drafted.
I’m absolutely disgusted 😢😢😢😢
Tomlin and the Steelers locker room couldn't even handle George Pickens! Shedeur is the LAST thing they need!
Shadeur problem is his dad, any team that draft him is drafting his family too and his dad as qb coach / OC and HC within one year and probable GM all in one pick,  Shadeur under different name would be drafted by now
Shedeur 6 on ESPN
My son and I were discussing this and I told him that someday Shedeur is going to be sporting a gold jacket and there are going to be several teams kicking themselves over not drafting him when they had the chance.
“Arrogance repels. Humility inspires.”
I have never seen a professional league do a incoming player like this, all I can say is WOW.
Why Charles Davis talking like he Scottish or from Great Britain tho 😂😂💀 Where did that accent come from 🤔🤔
Maybe Shedeur should go play in USFL and take it from there.
The little talent he has doesn't justify the drama he brings. Simple as that. He is not a generational talent, he is not a franchise builder, so why bother.
Who wants a slightly better than avg NCAA QB, comes in Day 1, with all the arrogance, cockiness, & "it's all about me" attitude like Deion Sanders, just without the talent. Not gonna find to many takers. Few of us were laughing about this earlier, anybody remember the 80's movie, "Johnny B Good"? This is just 2025's version of that movie.
Professional sports is entertainment, entertained yet?
The league is doing what they did to Colin Kaepernick to him. They don’t want a strong father and son to hold an organization hostage, so they think. Super messed up. The Sanders family didn’t deserve that.
Dude was 1-8 against top 25 teams in college. He’s not good
Rich coming off waaaay too biased here
Maybe teams just dont want to deal with circus that comes with Sanders circle.
Lets blame everyone except the Sanders's family.  Or that 32 teams are all working together.   Analyst suck.
Ngl Rich was annoying in this one bro
This is what happens when QB does not go to combine, does not work out at pro day and interviews poorly...
Shedeur Sanders probably won't get drafted.  So go to the CFL like Warren Moon did.
Shedeur Sanders needs to promise a social media clause in his contract, and several teams will pick him. QB is the face of a team, and NFL teams don't want a social media reality show.
At the end of the day it’s their loss. I’m rooting for Shadeur and will definitely be following the team that’s smart enough to pick him. However I’ve lost all respect for the NFL.
NFL players u have to boycott,m as a NFL fan ,I'm no longer watching this racist crap until he is drafted
Beg and be Humble?!! This reeks of “Know your place, boy!!”  Why are they bringing up Kaepernick in the same breath?!!”   This is messy!!!
Rich is gonna get back with Keith Olberman to start their new show the MENS VIEW guest starring Whoopi
Rich Eisen, Mel Kiper, and Skip Bayless have damn near tarnished their reputations the way they have glazed Sanders and cried for two days now how "disgusting" it is as if any of these teams are obligated to take a certain player. They can take whoever they want and it's not him
“League teaching the family a lesson”- here come the conspiracy whack-a-doodles 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫  I hope the kid gets a chance. If he fails then so be it, if he succeeds i hope everyone remembers to give him his flowers.
Makes me wanna see Draft Day again. And old Youtube Videos with Tom Bradys Draft Days. If 32 Teams pass on a Top Draft player?  Someone have messed up.
Shedeur sucks lol
it was amusing after day one but after day two its ridiculous.
It's personal, blackballed choose either one if not both 😮
Shedeur just isn’t that good. Sorry to say. He is below average at best. It’s the hype over the last two years that make us believe he is a starting qb in the NFL.
Facts.... they're trying to teach a LESSON 😢
Why would I want a backup quarterback that requires MORE work for the rest of my employees(staff)?  Plus, A big dollar sign chain around his neck and a huge dollar sign across the back of his suit coat?  Why would I want to hire a person who thinks that's a good thing to wear?
Do not beg the NFL for anything especially when it's crystal clear that the league and owners are colluding against you!  They want a rich, talented, successful Black family to stay in the perceived, traditional lowly place for Blacks.  How dare you outshine us!  This is purely racial, period!!!!!
What did Shedure  Sanders her you know who has to apologize for
THIS  IS WAY DEEPER THAN PURE FOOTBALL
Shadeur brings a media circus with him. A nonstop distraction.
Eisen is the prototypical boomer who says this generation is soft while coddling a young person so much, they avoid all responsibility.
Rich Eisen talks like Shedeur is the greatest college QB of all time..Did he watch his last Bowl game????....if you really study his games he is average during a game ,he has some good throws...I am  more surprised Will Howard wasn't taken yet, he is better than Shedeur and the Browns  taking Dillon Gabriel , the AFC North will destroy that little guy.
Sanders is getting “Kapernicked”.  Owners don’t like him, won’t draft him.  Disgusting.  Hold the line Eisen.
Shedeur fan or not, this is strange behavior, especially from the teams that need a QB.
Wel 102 players have been drafted & S Sanders is sitting on the sofa like i am waiting to hear his name be called 😔.....This is ridiculous and i pray this kid gets a opportunity to smack all the  NFL teams who didn't draft him including my " Dallas Cowboys " in the face ! The ultimate revenge is success and Sanders winning some playoff games or even just "1 Superbowl" would be a must see movie like ex  Rams qb Kurt Warner who has a movie about his rough journey to the NFL and winning a Superbowl . Praying for S Sanders the NFL is clearly trying to humble him🙄
Rich is PRESSED over this
I’ll drop out of draft and coach with my father the race war and haters  can have it😮
He’s too full of himself and his “talent” doesn’t justify the distraction and headaches with not only his baggage but his father running his mouth. It’s the nfl version of the Ball family.  He’s basically EJ Manuel 2.0 or Quincy Carter nothing more
Heaters!!! 💯
I’m shocked Raiders didn’t pick him up yet… they need a young and talented backup quarterback.
Mel Kiper had Shedeur ranked #1 i appreciate Rich calling it what it is. This kid is not a 4th round talent. Its personal and to tell a player with 4000+ yards 37 Tds  and no criminal off the field stuff Call And Beg  is out right awful.
Not right, these guys are bots!!
Charles Davis. What is considered talent now?
Daniel Jeremiah is the greatest analyst around.
He should go to the cfl and play
I'm done NFL the good old boys can have it
Goto to hell whoever said “self reflection”
If you watched shedure he was the least on the camera he wanted to just work that’s all we saw there’s players doing cameras all over those are facts
it's a conspiracy against Shedeur . to say he doesn't have the talent would be insane, look at what he did at Jackson State and Colorado, and he has great accuracy and a good arm.
Why self reflection that will not change. Silly take
There’s a huge difference between confidence and arrogance, not only is Sanders arrogant, he gave the impression that coaching and listening to criticism would not be welcomed. Same thing happened with Wentz in Philly, you think you know better than coaches and won’t fix flaws
Rich stop. We know deoin is your friend
Media desperate to justify Shedeur.  He IS NOT THAT GOOD.
Jonny manzel was allowed to miss practice and start on his last year in college which was not as good as the year before he was blessed with talent where he can read cover then run around he can throw or pass and had great protection… Colorado no QB wants to bank their career there let’s be real
I wss as my to see these interview tapes.
Its 100% Karma hes dealing with right now, there where many many teams that had a need at QB, and passed on him multiple times, because they dont want to deal with the b.s. As talented as he has been at times, and could be, teams dont want the baggage.
You it’s bin yapping about this bum from the start of draft that’s the problem
It's ok, he's still going Dallas...
Are you serious? Call teams & beg them to draft you? 😂 Kid has never been in trouble. Johnny manziel & Baker Mayfield were also cocky they didn't have to beg to be drafted
If I’m Shedeur I’m not calling nobody.. dude in the blue suit probably was a plant, sent to make the suggestion for the final step of humiliation.. if im Shedeur I’ll wait to see what’s up. Then I’ll call some teams to be a back up to a great team and wait my turn. I’m not calling no team who passed on me
The guy asking him to beg is pitiful.
Shedeur not going is only a story because you guys are making it a story.   Stop talking about a guy not drafted and talk about the guys who were.
They all know whats happening is wrong,  they all know it you can see it on their faces and i dont think they even like it
Let’s be honest this is about humiliating Shedeur and his father. Shedeur has been the best player on the board for since beginning of round 2. Look at his numbers then look at the QBs that went ahead of him  Touchdowns: 37 Passing yards: 4,134 Completions: 353 Completion percentage: 74%  The numbers don’t lie but the general managers, owners, and coaches are being ridiculous and spouting foolishness about him.
A CFL will gladly sign Shedeur Sanders if he goes undrafted
NFL scouts OBVIOUSLY disagree about his on the field play. They don't have to worry about upsetting Coach Prime and their relationship to him like the media, they can be honest.  Not a great arm, holds the ball too long, etc.
“Get on your knees and beg to massa” is basically what he said. Smh sick
I think the owners of the NFL are just sending him a clear message. Message is you are nothing special and the NFL is bigger than you and your dad.  Get in line or get left on the sideline . He needs to walk a fine line here. And I’m sure he need to apologise to someone . I don’t know who but I’m sure he and his dad knows. They better pick a phone and call that dude. He’s holding the keys to the door fr
Shedeur led the nation in completion percentage 74.0 He also had the most accurate passes beyond 50yrds in college rank 11th in yards per attempt and had the 3rd best PFF passer rating @90.5. For reference Thats better than caleb williams 63.9 and CJ stroud Ohio state completion pct. 71.2 Cj highest pff 92.2 Williams pff 90.3  Cj yrd per pass 7.7 Williams yrd per pass 9.07 Sanders yrd per pass 8.7   It's simple  The NFL is putting shedeur through a "humiliation ritual"  His numbers say top 3 QB.
Maybe talk about the 100 players who actually teams wanted
Rich eisen sounds like he needs a midol and a nap. These people are ridiculous this is a manufactured story just so they can have something to talk about
Another reason Sheduer should have a agent he goes into those teams and works to get things done...Let him have those tough hard conversations instead of leaving it up in the air
Sheduer has sadly to much drama attached to him, people aren't that stupid to have that in their organization, his daddy is more harm than a asset to him.  They think they are entitled and it has been all about them, like they're above everyone else,  I guess they aren't.
I really like joel klatt but this wasnt it. Joel and rich are my favorite sports personalities in general and rich stood on fucking buisness. He knows sheduer is a good kid because he knows him personally.  Joel should be ashamed questioning his character when joel sat on his own show and talked about how everyone in boulder and the denver metro area have nothing but good things to say about sheduer... respectful....charming... whatever. Would a person with bad character go to a middle school with a kid who was being bullied? Does that sound like someone who is full of themselves? This is character assassination plain and simple.
The media creates a massive circus around this kid not being taken in the first three rounds of the draft, and then they wonder why nobody has taken him in the first three rounds of the draft.  The vast majority of the teams that need QBs are dumpster fires.  Some of them, like the Browns, are perennial dumpster fires.  Those are literally the EXACT type of teams that DO NOT need the Sanders Family Circus coming to town with Shadeur.  Moreover, none of these media "experts" truly know what Shadeur was like in the meetings with teams.  For all we know, his interviews were all-time terrible.  Wasn't there a widely circulated report that Shadeur literally had his dad on FaceTime with a team during one of his interviews?  I feel like I definitely remember that being widely reported, and for some reason, nobody in the media made a big deal out of it.  I seem to recall that it wasn't even a big story at all, and the media personalities who did bother to discuss it were like "Oh that's great!  Deion got to talk with these teams at the same time Shadeur did!"  Meanwhile that seems like a massive red flag to me.  This kid has never been coached by anyone but his own father.  How can that not be a red flag?  His daddy spent his entire time coaching Shadeur at Colorado blaming literally every player on the team EXCEPT his own son for the team's struggles.  Then he retired his own son's jersey despite the fact that Shadeur accomplished LITERALLY NOTHING while he was the QB at Colorado.  The Colts were ruthlessly clowned for hanging an "AFC Championship Game Finalist" (or whatever it was) banner in their stadium.  And rightfully so because that is unbelievably pathetic.  What exactly did Shadeur Sanders do to deserve his freaking jersey being retired by Colorado?  BEFORE HE WAS EVEN DRAFTED IN THE NFL!!!  As an OSU fan, I could've sworn I just watched the Buckeyes win the CFB Championship a few months ago, but maybe I was mistaken and that was actually the Colorado Buffaloes with Shadeur Sanders leading them to victory in that Championship game.  Every single thing that Shadeur and Deion have done over the last two years has been a red flag to NFL teams.  And the sports media keeps claiming that Shaduer's play on the field warrants him being drafted no matter what "red flags" he may have shown.  Really?  Is that really true?  Or is it possible that if his last name was not "Sanders" and his dad had not manufactured all of this years-long hype for him, that maybe the so-called "experts'" evaluations of him would not be as flattering as they have been?  I'm not an "expert talent evaluator", so I'm not saying he either is or isn't worthy of being a top-100 pick based on his on-field talent alone.  I'm just saying that it's possible that NFL teams...seemingly ALL OF THEM at this point...don't think as highly of his "on-field abilities" as the media "experts" do.  All I know is this, as an unfortunate lifelong Browns fan, I am absolutely certain that a dumpster fire franchise like the Browns DOES NOT need the Sanders Family Circus coming to town.  And one more thing I am absolutely certain of is that a guy like Dylan Gabriel will NEVER "rock the boat", no matter where he is on the QB depth chart.  Not even a Sanders sycophant like Rich would have the nerve to claim that Shaduer and/or Deion would "not rock the boat" if he had been drafted by the Browns at #94 and went into Game 1 of the regular season as QB #3 on the depth chart behind Flacco and Pickett.  We already saw exactly how that situation would've played out when OBJ's dad went on social media complaining about Baker not throwing him the ball.  It literally tore the team apart and ended with OBJ being cut and Baker being traded and replaced with a predator named Watson via the worst trade in NFL history.  So yeah...I'm 100% satisfied with the Browns passing on Shadeur, even if I think that Gabriel is a guaranteed waste of a very valuable top-100 draft pick.
In my opinion, this boils down to three things. 1: if it is correct, which I don’t know if I’ll ever know, but he interviewed poorly and is alleged to have been cocky and arrogant 2: teams don’t want to deal with Deion point blank period. You know he’s gonna be publicly second-guessing coaching decisions, and how his son is being used. And teams just don’t wanna deal with it. 3: the nature of the quarterback position it’s like the one guy second from left in this clip is saying the quarterback position is different and having these traits is undesirable. I mean, if you think of Deion Sanders being drafted in 89 and the way he handled his business it was a media spectacle. And it was OK because like he’s a defensive player can you possibly imagine Deion Sanders in 1989 being the way that he was and a quarterback ? There’s no way he would’ve been drafted the exact same scenario we seen with Shedure yesterday and today , would’ve played out with Deion then in 1989
The NIL is gonna kill these kids. Why pay some overhyped player who got paid in college and thinks he's better than he is because his NIL deal and transfer portal. NFL teams want CONSISTENCY AND LOYALTY. PLAYERS WHO STAY ALL 4 YEARS AT 1 SCHOOL. HOWS THE NIL MONEY NOW.
Lets go Rich
Sanders to LV in 4th with 6th pick. Watch. Mentors in Brady, Pete, and Geno. Best place… better than PIT for Sanders
They did this boy dirty on purpose.. we've seen less talented QB's/players taken, we've seen more questionable character QB's/players taken every year... Now all of a sudden the NFL doesn't want social media attention cough cough Taylor Swift.. the question is who told the league to send a message.. because as a fan your telling me we're taking the best player available, we're trying to win etc.
Teams don't want the drama, and they don't want Deion criticizing their work every week. There's enough drama anyway, they don't want to import it.
Racism
They watch film but you draft TYLER SHOUGH over Shedeur sanders 😂😂😂😂😂😂 off talent and film alone he was a top 5 rated player out of college on every single evaluation. And these dudes are "analyst"?😭
When tom brady get picked or sf qb
Rich is too close to Deion. I get it, they are close friends, and it's his friend's kid, and you have a deeper emotional connection. I feel bad for him because this entire Draft season he was convinced Shedeur was going top 10, or 21st at worst. This scenario was never even considered by him. He's struggling to comprehend it. I can empathize with that.   Also... maybe the "Eli theory" is not so wild after all. The idea is that Deion, behind the scenes, basically told every team - except one - to not take Shedeur. That one team can then either use their last pick, or even just sign as a UDFA, and you can choose where you go. I think this theory was truly wild up until the 40th pick, give or take, and you no longer were getting picked by a team who believed in you.
Could it possibly be because Sheduer just isn't that talented?! The only reason his name was pushed so freaking hard was because of Deion. The media and Deion are the ones that set Sheduer up to be hurt by making him out to be better than he actually is.
All the commentators going to pandering and bowing to the nfl to cover this up. Except for eisen and Stephen A
Sanders is Lonzo Ball 2.0.......Except Lonzo had talent before he was injured
Yet Johnny Manzel warranted a first round pick.
a) its hard to judge someone's talent in a situation like this.  when your dad is calling the plays - are the plays called to give the most talented people on the field the best chance to be successful?  are the plays called to win?  or are the plays called to increase your draft stock?  Colorado was a mediocre team lead by a mediocre qb with a mediocre coach.  now, teams have the opportunity to draft a mediocre qb that comes with a truck full of baggage. . . that would be like drafting one of the Lavar Ball's kids. . . you are inviting the circus to town. . . 100% not worth it. . .
@5:55 WTH is he talking about!? He does not need to beg a GM to get on a team. Rich can't be co-signing these clowns.
Shedookies QBR was #16 last year 😮😮😮 not top 3 or 5 or 10… SIXTEEN CAPECHE🎉
them drones going crazy in the back. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
5:33 Nooooo. Horrible advice! Don’t beg. If they want you, they will let you know. Go where you’re wanted, Shadeur.
Come to Columbus we pay big
All yes men accept Rich…
Shedeur is Kaepernick 2.0....talented but not worth the drama and distraction. That ridiculous "Legend" necklace pretty much says all you need to know about Homeboy.
He we go again goes undrafted but the whole segment is spent talking about him 🤔
What a waste of a custom draft room 😞
There are professional scouts and general managers and then there are these idiots that get paid to read off a teleprompter. These guys don't know anything about any of the people being drafted other than what is on the teleprompter
32 teams didn't gell with him??? Bullshit!! It's because he's black and his dad is Deion Sanders son
DJ just gave out some great advice that any mature young man would follow.  Shedeur is not a mature young man; his father has never reached maturity, so it’s not a surprise.  I laughed out loud at Rich Eisen pushing hard against a QB being a distraction immediately after seeing the effect Rodgers had on his Jets.
i forget, what pick was johnny manzel? lol rich is completely right
Does he go... Undrafted?
I don't know OBVIOUSLY but i wonder if some of the teams didn't want the possible "show" that comes along with the Sanders, or they didn't want father Sanders to be trying to pull strings or control decisions. Did he deserve a jersey number retirement? Hell nah. Was he at least a round 3 or up QB, yah What else could it be? i am asking There is a huge difference between in house media and a players personnel media, teams demand control on so much
Raiders going to take him in the 4th.
Shaduer a millionaire why would he call and beg
This narrative of a backup is with too much attention, which is crazy bullish.
So now the young man got a pay for the job he got a bend down and kiss the gentleman in the owners butt because he confident about his game and about whatever and I’m surprised I’m hearing this on TV that he got a call up general manager and apologizewhat happened to your play on the football field? Wow, that’s crazy.
DJ wants him to beg. That’s disgusting
Have these talking heads read about Shedeur's disastrous interviews? Dude was arrogant, self centered, disrespectful, and brash. Add in his sure-to-be-meddling, second guessing father and it's no wonder that teams are passing on him.
How can u fault teams for not wanting him?  It’s obviously him & I agree. He needed to b humble & his dad should’ve stayed out
Is the NFL sending a message to the NBA that we don’t care who your father is ?
PLEASE Ravens Flock get him! PERFECT backup for Lord Lamar!!👿💪🏿💪🏿🙏🏿✊🏿✊🏿
Charles had some great points
Shadeur is a kid chasing his dream , to try and spite him to me is very childish
All Deion could do is run fast.  🏉
With all due respect stop diminishing collusion.
Stop covering for these teams drafting clowns over Saunders.
That guy talking about beg 😂 he needs to beg for a better suit 😂
Deion's persona ruined Shedeur's shot plain and simple. NO ONE likes a braggert greenhorn. Respect is EARNED.
Or it could be that he was simply overrated by the buzz and the media.
Johnny Manziel was a KNOWN addict…Baker Mayfield ran from the police and we talking about controlling a narrative 🤣
It did start to feel like a humiliation ritual for Shedeur by the third round
you can tell this show started to go off the rails because its very obv something here is happening that doesnt happen in the draft
I wouldn’t want him on my team. It would be a huge distraction and he isn’t even that good.
A LeBron don't look so bad after all
Anyone at all maybe think he was just kinda overated?? Everyone claimin he was the best qb in the draft and yet no teams in the NFL agree with that take obviously...  because trust me if any of the teams who are lookin for a franchise QB believed he was that good, they woulda drafted him already..... that being said i wish nothin but the best for the young man. God throws tests our way at times. Someone is gonna eventually pick the guy up and then he will have an even bigger chip on his shoulders
White owners sounds about white 🇺🇲
This fall is legendary.
Did I miss something Shedeur did? Every time I've seen him or heard him on anything he's seemed like a good kid. He might drive a Rolls-Royce or whatever that bothers people for whatever reason, but  he doesn't act like an a hole, he acts like a pretty humble respectful dude. So what's with the "he needs to do some Deep Self Reflection" nonsense, acting like theres indications he has a bunch of character flaws. This guy obviously dislikes something about the last name Sanders.
There is no better place for young Sanders than with Pete Carol.  Pete knows how to unlock the prime time in Shedeur Sanders 2.  Not to mention, Geno Smith is very similar in the way he carries himself and demeanor.  Geno would serve as another mentor and can share his similar story and how he persevered.
If Michael Vick found work AFTER PRISON, there's nothing left to contemplate. It's merit versus distraction. When distraction outweighs ability, you don't get picked up. Pretty basic.
3:06 "the QB is different." What did the Browns give Watson again?
Watch tha utube moderatorz trip bcz i told tha truth...
4:30 is so brutal. No fire works for sanders
I think Deon hurt his son in this draft and it doesn’t make it right how the league conspired against the kid.
I learned ALL I need to know about Shadeur by watching his draft party video. His attention is on his stupid chain, his entourage, his music, his chain, Deion, his STUPID CHAIN....I wouldn't want him on my team
Too many of y'all confuse his arrogance as confidence.
Perhaps they watched the lakers with bronny and realized what a circus it would become. Also, the coach on that team might fear that deion may want to make a play for their job. Maybe, they don't like his rapping.  I know some players at colorado had to go to a concert to watch him sing. With that said, he is a football player and could become successful if he can appreciate that teams don't want a distraction present.  A real good team with aging quarterback might take him know. The rams, new orleans or sf should consider him.
I’m starting to loose respect for rich like stop it your friends son isn’t all of that be a professional and do your job
Look I'm 47yrs old.  I was a Joe Montana Fan, as well as a John Taylor fan coming up.  I thought San Francisco should have drafted him.  You didn't humble Johnny Maziel, nor Baker Mayfield.  He is not more of a distraction than Tebow.  You guys even Drafted Michael Sam.   He would be a great NFL quarterback.   He is made to adapt through anything.  He is confident.  And he will sacrifice to win ball games.  And this denies the NFL consumer as a Fan to see the best Play.  All to publicly Humble a Man cause he is popular and confident.  Then you advise him to call and beg quietly, WOW!  Just say what the issue is.  You drafted cocky Ryan Leaf.  Shilo should have been drafted by now also
Sanders can go work at Walmart.  🏉
Why didn't they mention what teams should have drafted him?  Also what teams did they say he wouldn't play for?
The racist NFL owners pledged together not to draft Sanders, which is beyond evil. All these guys are lying to your damn faces. NFL IS CANCELED ON MY END
So when you go into an interview,  don't you promote yourself? I'm goin to go into that interview and tell those folk that I'm an the best hire they can make, and I wont accept the minimum salary, and I'm going to exceed the expectations of the position. If they are intimidated.....they are too weak of a company to work for. That's the way of the world in this age of those who are not good enough to be the best and still got a participation trophy. They can't cope with someone who is clearly good at what they do, and will show you and tell you at the same time.  I'd rather be Mohamed Ali and talk s*** to you before the fight, doing the fight and after to fight once I kick you r a*. If you can't handle it, get out of the ring. The draft is the best example of collusion. I'm the all time leading completion percentage leader,  I have been successful in low talent situations at all levels, I'm a black QB who is best in the pocket, and I don't make errors under pressure......AND I have a 3.9 GPA and actually enjoy my chemistry class. I wonder IF Manning down at UT has the same success, will he not be drafted on day 1? H** no! That's the face that the league would rather see, both he and his dad's fam. Lets address the elephant in the room. Elway said he would not play football if he was drafted be a certain team, Eli Manning said he didn't want to be drafter by a certain team, and you sheep are talking humility??? Why can the white boy pick and choose in this slave trade, however the Bother can't? This will come back to bite these teams just like Randy Moss came back to bite the Cowboys.
Remember when Shedeur said "We know where we're going baby" and then wore giants colored cleats to the alamo bowl? I guess he didn't know where he was going.
I bet Dallas will draft Shedeur on Day 3…seems like a “Jerruh” move
Telling him to beg when he’s proven himself over and over is crazy. Yall see what this is and are choosing to be ignorant. God has 2!
No more pulling punches, some team really really messed up.  If Brian D, Kellen Moore Dave Canalles don’t make it as head coaches we will remember they didn’t Draft Shedeur Sanders
Guys, sometimes the answer is simple. Shadeur said, to the owners, if you don’t want to change your culture then don’t pick me.  Looks like they’re listening so far.
The reason he’s undrafted is simple-  HE ISN’T THAT GOOD.
Would be crazy if he didn't get drafted
It’s funnny how the person who wasn’t picked and should have been picked is the most talked about! 😀
Shout out to rich for holding deion down
No intelligent person is surprised that Shedeur wasn't hired to be an employee in the first two rounds nor would they suggest a silly conspiracy. I and others have been calling him NOT GREAT all year.  Shedeur has a 13-12 record in a tier two conference, 1-7 vs ranked teams, and 0-1 blowout loss in a bowl game. His stats were padded by a heavy dose of 1 yard bubble screens and daddy play-calling. He did NOTHING but get over-hyped by his daddy and by kool-aid clowns like Joel Klatt. His tik-talk ego, however, was LEGENDARY.  His self awareness.....not so much.
This is def a humiliation ritual, reflection, Beg, etc. he can only get drafted if he bows down.
Shedeur Sanders was more talented than Michael Sam. Even half of the reason Travis Hunter won the Heisman. This is sicken with the excuses made. I get every team aren’t in the market for a qb. It makes no sense for a heisman nominee to be available day 3.
This is ridiculous! You want this kid to beg!??? WOW! That’s crazy! This is messy and it was created by the NFL. Now they ya’ll trying to figure this out! 😂😂
You are scared to tell the truth you grown men. If it was your kid you would be angry.
Dion called in a favor with Rich....
I said it for MONTHS, ZERO QBs are worth drafting in the 1st round, let alone Sanders.  But all these "analysts" loved Sanders in Top 5 or 10.  Ridiculous.  How much $ do these so called "analysts" make?  Useless... I can make better predictions
He will get drafted, I think the Raiders, Rams, Steelers or Lions won't be able to resist dropping a 5th or 6th rd pick. The Rams, Lions, or Raiders need a guy to sit behind Stafford, Goff, or Geno for a year or 2.
All the Media will lie to protect the NFL
This is ridiculous! You want this kid to beg!??? WOW! That’s crazy! This is messy and it was created by the NFL. Now they ya’ll trying to figure this out! 😂😂
Why is rich being intentionally obtuse about the reality of the situation? The league has told shedeur THEY DON'T WANT YOU! If they did, he wouldn't be undrafted going into round 4. Period.
After round 1 What does it even matter ??   Hes going to get drafted and it will be old news.    I would be picking him because hes going to have a big chip on his shoulder with a lot to prove
On pro day he didn’t look that good to me his throws made target but it was kinda wobbly and to me his pass looked like it didn’t have zap to it. But honestly I ain’t no pro
So the owners and GMs have an agenda against the Sanders family? He's famous because he's from the Sanders family.
Can we stop talking about Sanders. No one cares y’all been talking about him for the last year. It’s time to move on
Time to give another talented deserving player waiting to be drafted some attention.  Move on!
Maybe he ain’t got what it takes!
Did they tell this kid to call gm’s and beg? Oh nah this is crazy
Now you want him to beg. Wtf.
Did he just say BEG wow.
Obviously Shedeur made all this by his self! His attitude and the way he presents him self is what has him still not picked. This notion that he is being blackballed by the league is nonsense! It is all on Shedeur!
Green Bay turning on a great NFL Draft, great show team.
Tim Tebow , Blaine Gabbert and Paxton Lynch were 1st rounders, let that sink in.
So the commentator on the far right says Sanders should grovel before the NFL General managers. It says a lot about how the commentator conducts his life. One long episode of groveling after another. They are doing this to stick it up Dion's backside period.
Teams dont want the mess... The problem is hes not talented enough to warrant the potential craziness
YOU CANT EXPLAIN IT AWAY BECAUSE ITS BS... THEYRE TRYING TO PROVE A POINT... PERIOD AN ITS FUKED UP...
They need the ratings and something to continue to talk about cuz everyone’s only watching to see Shedeur get drafted 💯
If you don’t believe in a player you don’t draft him 🌭
It seems like the NFL has collectively decided he is not worth the potential headache. I would expect one of the bottom feeders to pick him up tomorrow and he will get ground up and spit out to a new team in 2 or 3 years to maybe rehabilitate his career. The fact that Pittsburg passed on him as desperate as they are for a QB tells you everything you need to know about the baggage they believe he is bringing. The kid is poison.
It amazes me that the nfl and commentators forget Johnnie manzeil. Red flags left and right, a sophomore got drafted 1st round. Baker Mayfield. They have the answer they don't want to see they ignore red flags from white qbs but if a black one with sanders as a last Name. They're punishing him. He's not going to get drafted or he will be drafted last.
Why did he get so much hate? And his dad too
Funny how when you don’t have a white man agreeing with the narrative he doing to much RICH always been a real one!!!
I gotta give it to rich even when he's told this guy sucks.He still holds his ground and tries to stand up for deion. Personally. I think it's great. I think shedeur has been a total jerkoff. He got his number retired at school and didn't even get drafted in the first 3 rounds. What a joke 😅
Who's this guy kidding?? No social media 😂😂😂😂   Its the Sanders
It's ok for Baker Mayfield to have red flag on and off the field. It's ok for Johnny Manzel to have off the field problems. Shedeur have good grades in school, no off the field problems, and have the college completion percentage record. I want my quarterback confident. Even President Trump called out the NFL for not drafting Shedeur yet. That's crazy
4:35 oh come on, it's not a conspiracy! Teams aren't "teaching the Sanders family a lesson". They have found other players who are better talents, satfisy needs, and who aren't doofuses in the lockeroom. He's just not that great a pick.
Everything will all be speculation. Kuler Murray went 1st.  Daniel Jones went 6th and Dwayne Haskins went 16th in the 2019 draft.   It is on record that Kyler does not watch film. Daniel Jones was not that good. What is Haskins doing?  Last year, Anthony Richardson was a reach. But he had a canon arm and could run.  So you are telling me that Shedeur is not a better prospect than Jones, Haskins and Richardson? Thats kinda where him not being drafted is a weird one.  At the end of the day, teams do not think he is that good. He will have to show them different by going undrafted.
Nah, no begging.
They want him too beg???? Smh yall must be crazy he one of the best players in the draft if I were him I would play in another league he already rich FUCC THE NFL
You're not gonna teach the sanders nothing
AINT NOBODY BEGGING TO STOKE RACIST OWNERS EGO'S. QUIT THE FOOLISHNESS
Sadly, Americans are loving this!!! To watch an arrogant father and son being humiliated
If you don’t have the answers then stop trying to give the solution.  But we know you know the REAL reasons
Sheadure is trash it's not that complicated
if yall see shadors interviews pre draft he gives off the impression that he doesn’t care and didn’t answer questions directly (ie look at his interviews post colorado draft showcase) so i can see why teams pass on him….its no different than u or i interviewing for jobs
He’s not that good! Every single team in the NFL has spoken! The narrative these race-baiters are trying to push is bullshit. He is not better than the QBs that went before him. And will continue to go before him. He will be lucky if he goes before the 6th round. This was always going to be the case. A good lesson in humility.
Im with you Rich
This is "Legendary" ...
I'm sorry Sheduer doesn't have to beg anybody to be drafted.The young man has shown nothing but excellence at every level and shown on and off the field the quality young man  he is.This is crazy!
I've lost all respect for the NFL. As a  Patriots fan, I will not be watching games going forward. Shedeur not being drafted is absolutely diabolical.
Team didn't draft Sanders because of Deion, dad, can cause team's headache...
Would love to see Shedeur Sanders thrive in the XFL.
No team wants a distraction Deions a distraction
look in these comments to see who's glad and if they have a profile pic see if you see a common thread
5:35 This is what he should of been saying during the Combine meetings and team meetings. Because what-ever he said instead, clearly hasnt worked
First of all, shout out to you fellas up there. Great show! Great production secondively. I've been talking to people and I'm 71 years old. I'll be on the bus riding the train. People said Dion's talking too much got his son to this place. It's funny how you can be confident and know what you can really do. It's crazy man. It's still the good old boy Network. I hate to say so and then on the other part of that if they don't want you they don't want you no matter why they don't want you. But this is deeper then whatever you guys take it easy. Be safe. If he doesn't go in the third round I guess he'll go to the sfl or whatever the others place is that they go. That's just my position on it and who wouldn't want they son in the best position. If they could get them in the Mannings did it. I think it's just a personal thing. It's crazy man. Oh well. I wish him the best. Take care of y'all
The message is "this is the National Football League, not the National Sanders League".
All I can say is I don’t want to hear any more talk about my Steelers needing to desperately chase Aaron Rodgers old drama queen a$$ around after this.  If they aren’t desperate enough to pull the trigger on Sanders here in the late rounds then clearly they are happy with Mason freakin’ Rudolf and hoping for a miracle pick to fall in their laps next year.   This kid certainly has enough talent to be given a shot at this point.  I need to know why MY team isn’t willing to roll the dice at this point.  I could care less why the other 31 teams aren’t picking him up here in the 3rd round.
Shadeur is simply nowhere near good enough to behave like that. Comes back weird and autistic. Like you think you're Mahomes but are actually more like Matt Corral.
Shedeur is already a millionaire. With all the problems young folks are experiencing today, not being drafted in the first three rounds of the NFL, hardly qualifies him as a victim. Yet, the media treats him as if he is a victim. Legendary, indeedy!
the Sanders answer is simple.  College football.  Deion is drawing a lot of player attention to colorado, but if none of his players get drafted it's have a huge effect on recruiting.  The nfl money people are also college football boosters. Prime messed with the money
What’s your name boy? Kunta Kinta. But they want him to say Tobi.
How many times are you going to say "narrative?"
Everyone is humbling Deione and nobody wants to hear Deione mouth and circus. Humility is in order.
How much is a day 3 contract worth? Not nearly as much as a 1st rounder.
All these excuses is  all BS smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Ryan leaf will get drafted before Shedeur Sanders
No one wants the drama that comes with this guy
you get the kid and his big mouth dad..ain't no-body want that...
This whole conversation is nonsense. They know the reason he's not been drafted they just won't say it out loud. Rich Eisen is trying his best, but Joel Klatt and the idiot on the end are morons trying to create a narrative that cannot be justified.
Jeff George had one of, mabe the, best arms in NFL history, but his attitude and arrogance kept team mates from wanting to play with him.
He’s not that good. Way better QBs coming out next year. Wouldn’t be surprised if Hunter is a bust as well.
Where is Jimmy Horn!!!!!???
This is EXACTLY like the film Draft Day with Kevin Costner.  The unanimous top player in the draft was a QB, but when Kevin Costner's character passed over him, that caused a reaction by every other NFL team as they immediately are freaked out like "why??  If so and so passed, then they know something we don't!" So in turn they pass on picking the guy and he continues to slide down the board.  The reason revealed by Costner's character was the intangibles and a single, tiny moment where something didn't sit right with him after a phone call with the QB.  The film explains exactly what is happening with Shedeur!
I love the cope with rich the cry baby
Thank you Rich Eisen!  It's preposterous.  Stop it Joel!!!  He's not calling JACK!  I'd sit it out.  F'm!  We're acting like the player is the only one that makes the money when the star gets on the team!  That's that imperialism crap!  If this player comes in and plays lights out, guess who makes the most money?!  Stop it!  Joel keeps saying he don't have the answers but he spent the majority of the time talking!  Perfect!
Imagine thinking this is an NFL teams problem and not Shedeurs.
Rich Eisen seems to be taking this Shadeur draft slide worse than the Sanders’ family. It’s almost like it happened to him. It’s weird watching how upset he is about the situation and how mad he seemed to be with Joel Klatt’s opinion.
When you draft Shedeur, you also get Prime. And teams dont wanna deal with that. Simple.
Arena Football Son!
Hopefully with all that’s going on in the world God isn’t paying attention to the NFL draft.
Did you just try to compare the talent of Hunter to Shedeur? Really?
So beg!  Right!  Why play for college football, if you're going to have to beg anyway?!  Just a question.
At this point if he doesn’t get drafted on Saturday look for a team to sign him post draft
You just know “Coach Prime” has been calling all his on air contacts like Eisen to try and craft this narrative to shame a team in to drafting him
"let me push back on that"  how about you let Rich finish first before pushing back on it.  If a player doesn't get drafted its either injury concern or character issues, we would've heard by now if it was injury related. Clearly, teams are wary of his surname and that is plain wrong. However, maybe he didn't nail the interview process and that raised legit concerns. However, I think he should've been taking by the Giants in round 1, Sanders are winners.
Shilo has more upside
I wasn't surprised he didn't go in the first round.  Only two quarterbacks got picked in that round and there was the possibility that a team would prefer Dart.  I wasn't expecting this though.  But someone on the panel made a good point.  Eventually he fell far enough that you wouldn't take a QB at that position with the intent of him being your starter but you wouldn't want your back-up attracting a media circus.  Not a first round talent, but first round attention from the media.  That's a bad combination.  A guy like Milroe can just be the guy on the sideline, learning the game and maybe being the starter someday, and not attracting any real attention.  At this point I wonder if he'll get drafted at all.  Though maybe if people like Rich didn't constantly build the guy up, teams would have been willing to take him on day 2 without him being a "distraction".  The non-stop talk about this guy is a big reason why teams fear that their back-up quarterback is going to have a dozen reporters following him around.  And we all know Rich is friends with Deion and probably has known Shedeur for years.  Geez, just acknowledge to yourself that there's a bias there.
Dallas will pick him up as their final pick in this draft.
Story is that Dabol gave Shedeur a playbook to study and Shedeur refuse and they had a bit of a problem with that.
He should’ve took the combine more serious, all these draft prospects are hungry some don’t have a rich family to go home to it’s your fault
It’s always the J school pundits with this Shadeur stuff because it is a narrative that makes a good story. Football people did not have Shadeur as a football talent
Funny I dont see them telling any of the other players not drafted yet to go in and beg for a job. Is that how the draft works just beg for a job you all sound completely insane almost every comment was complete and udder BS.
Joel Klatt, True "company man" give me a break 🤣😂😂
Shut up Klat!!! Stop dancing around the real narrative
What is with all the tears for this guy from espn talking heads?  Break out the violins for the poor silver spoon kid.  He has it all and these dorks are boo hooing like he’s destitute.  Dude is a locker room distraction and teams don’t want it running their franchise.  It’s not their job to employ him.  He’ll the cowboys passed on him.  His good buddy Jerry passed.
Be a lame get treated like a lame
I wouldn't be too surprised sometime tomorrow later in the draft that Pittsburgh may decide to go for Sanders Maybe they'll try and make him the last pick in the draft mr irrelevant
I absolutely agree that nfl owners are trying to teach the sanders family humility. Multiple Sanders trying to get contracts in the future, they need to be taught.
The meme name will be Shitter Sanders.
If Shadeor was going to lobby teams he should of done it on his 30 visits.  If he reaches out now he just looks like a complaining QB.
The fact you and media is talking about a mediocre qb is reason he ain’t picked
The saints are gonna be the only bet
Bro not saying he’s the best QB but seeing the players teams took over him why would he not think it’s personal?? Everyone with eyes can see what’s going on at this point
These teams ain’t god- telling him to beg ain’t it for me. Please please give me a chance really buddy.
Just stop Rich at this point about 20 draft analysts including yourself have been outed for this draft padding of friends kids etc then you want to sit here and blame everybody else for why your pick has not been selected. Perhaps you are not a good analyst. Ya guy the whole league jumped in a private meeting about the Sanders boys lol grow up. Not a single person believes that crap.
evaluate deez....
It’s almost like media is wrong. A lot.
Dion worked with Eisen and is friends with these guys. They are not being objective. Shadour not playing is all about the social media distraction, the circus surrounding him doesn’t match the talent. He is not a first year starter and teams don’t want the  hoopla. The league is definitely sending a message.
Poor bass mouth 🎉
CALLING IT: We will never see Sheduer play in the NFL. His career is over, already. Damn.
Buck Breaking 101 and these analysts want him to beg…Fu@k the NFL.
🤣😂 Hope he goes undrafted.
Are the folks over at ESPN yelling about the white devil yet? 😂
The bald guy on the left saying teams should manage their locker rooms the way they want but at the same time is shaming them for not taking Sanders. If they don't want him in their locker room then that's the teams running their locker room the way they want...
Rich is totally out of his depth on this.
Rich is missing the whole thing.  Sad!!
The NFL has spoken, they do not agree with the National sports media in regards to Sanders being a franchise quarterback.
In the NFL t ries to say in the courts that there's no such thing as collusion in their league??..
A player with TWO sexual assaults was drafted ahead of Shedeur yet people keep saying it's the "off the field stuff" when it comes to Shedeur. What a joke.
Just because you were good in college doesn't mean you will be good at the next level.
This reminds me of when mel kieper Jr. 1st draft argument, you analysis are just upset no one listened to you on this matter nice head scratch
They no exactly why he hasn’t been drafted yet.
Rich is a tool in search of a box he really wants to say its because he's bwack but 2 have already been drafted
College ain’t same rich. There’s a huge investment and sanders is disrespectful
Sheduer is gonna be great in the UFL
Such a good debate. Really well done.
When they say, “He needs deep reflection” — they’re protecting the machine.  Because THEY KNOW this is personal. THEY KNOW this is a coordinated freeze-out.
Shedeur he's not going to beg if NFL need Talent best quarterback they should go to him we all know how this politics work
Lost respect for rich
Sound like a bunch of soft a** GMs and Teams that's afraid to take a risk.
The first guy just ignored the Shedeur snub shows why people are just haters.
Shame on the NFL
You can't sit there and say there won't be any media attention on him as back up somewhere, when all the media is talking about is why he hasn't been drafted yet.
23 years old what's he still doing in college?
Rich, u alright with me brother. You’re making too much sense!
No coach could control deion stupid.
Someone gonna have to leak those interviews lol.
Bronny sanders just ain’t no good and streams his poor attitude
lol you can have sexual assault allegations though
It's definitely personal! Besides Mr. Eisen, the rest of the panel reason made no sense. He should beg to be selected? His tape and what he's done was not enough? I am not saying he should have been 1 overall, but come on! The NFL used the kid for nearly every commercial during the draft so please tell me what back up has that? This is a new low level and I  do not think it's a race thing but it is personal.
If you need a QB and you didn't pick Sanders, you're stupid. Brock Purdy already proved these guys at the highest levels don't know anything.
Rich is right ✅️
I absolutely think it’s possible he goes undrafted. The reasons he didn’t get picked in the third round are the same. It’s not about the round number and the pick value. Seattle went Milroe in the 3rd. The Browns took Gabriel with their third THIRD round pick. Vegas passed on him four times. The Giants took Dart. Art Rooney said they’re only interested in a backup.
I bet a lot of Shedeur haters lack self confidence and hate were they are in life, so seeing a young man that has came from wealth and has confidence be treated like this makes them feel better about them selves.
Humble? 😂
Why is the nfl so concerned about shadour social life bruh its sad the hate is real i agree with rich to the fullest
Why not talk about the other great players taken? They taking about Shedeur like he's John Elway STOP IT  the tape does not warrant the hype simple as that.
Oh come on man! His poor attitude and subpar talent mean undrafted.
I havent seen anything like this since Michael Sams.
no matter when he's drafted, he will be followed by the most cams of any player in this draft, or any maybe.... and every detail reported ad nauseum. Just be ready for saturated media coverage of this talented young man...
This kid did everything and he was the best quarterback in college he get there hard work and discipline all the practice day in the house year after year they took that away for him yes this is personal nothing else
Ridiculous
I’m not begging anyone God has a plan that’s it. I’m not calling any NFL teams it is what it is.
Streaming buck braking 🤣🤣🤣🤨🤨🤨
Did any of these guys watch actual tape, or just highlights?
5:55 "I just beg of you to give me the opportunity" WHAT!!?? Begging huh... Naw
Rich is such a homer. He does on those hills.
Sanders = XFL
This kid is a multi millionaire and will get his shot at becoming an NFL quarterback. Nothing to feel sorry for. He will be fine.
The NFL Nobody's bigger than the program
Falling to at least the 4th round now... it made sense to me he didn't go round 1 with the needs of teams and so many QBs going last year, but all these other QBs ahead of him now is really weird.
Rich clearly doesn’t get it.
The NFL is using the opportunity to humble a tiger, but the time will come when the tiger and his cub will unleash the fury of a proud family.  It is  inevitable. It time to fight.
Another showing to ppl that the rich have the power they don’t care who his daddy is they gave him his money sending him a message get down or lay down treating him like Kappernick smh about to break that boi in like a bronco I wouldn’t be surprised if they draft him last on purpose
I kinda want to know what went behind close doors bcuz for sanders to fall out the top 100 is crazy
I don’t buy that this is some conspiracy by the NFL to punish Sanders. You can’t get all 32 teams to agree on anything. If that was what was happening I’m sure there are a couple teams that would’ve taken him just to spite Goodell. His talent just doesn’t outweigh his shitty attitude.
The talent doesn't nearly rise to the level of the toxicity. Why would you want Aaron Rodger's drama with Zach Wilson's ability?
I hope everyone REALLY listens to what Charles Davis is saying here!
NFL wants Buck dancers that bow down and obey. Thats why Shedeur hasn't beed drafted yet.
Bro I could cry for shadeur. I understand ward, milroe, or even dart they’re all athletic run threat qbs. Shough and Gabriel is a crime, shough has just over 3k passing yards for a 5 year college career, in major part to SEASON ENDING injuries. 3 THOUSAND!!! Shadeur had 4k just last year, at this point it’s not even about football. They’re trying to humiliate him, not only does he have to deal with that but social media is literally laughing at him. Whoever gets him just got the steal of the century, I 100% think he’s gonna take it personal, and I 100% believe he’s gonna be a star. He’s strong, and he’s loyal, he stayed with his dad at an hbcu then followed him to a 1-11 team in a way tougher conference. He made something out of nothing not saying he did it alone, he had an amazing offense to throw to, but you can’t tell me if you put him at Oregon or Alabama he wouldn’t have had WAY better stats. The nfl did him a favor, now there’s no pressure he gets to learn the offense wherever he goes and bide his time. I hope when his moment comes he sets the league on fire.
Rich is right. This is utter bullshit and its obvious to all of America. Black stain NFL. Even Trump is quoting, cmon man..................🤣🤣🤣🤣 they are trying to teach and don't understand, we are not listening.We are well educated on the B.S. game.
LEGENDARY
@richeisenshow What other QB had to humble himself and call teams? This non selection exposes the Not For Long League then why would you have combines bades on talent????? What a stain on the NFL.
They all copying the eagles drafting process
Man this is crazy !!
It burns doesn't it Rich. The confirmation for where the guy currently ranks on the humility scale comes from his video following his fallout from the 1st Rnd. When he comes out and says "we all know something ain't right". That's all I needed to know, the flippancy, the casual attempt at deflecting and inference towards possible conspiracy, the sense of entitlement that seems to ooze slowly from him that he hasn't been coached out of yet. He's a young colt, somebody should break him and find out how good he can be.
if you all watch the videos from his brother you would see in my eyes the reason a pro football team has not drafted him yet. Yes he has the talent but when you go pro its not just the talent they have to look at. As they say here, he needs to do some self-reflection tonight.
The thing is he doesn’t have the raw talent. Below avg arm, slow, not big. Holds the ball too long. Stats in big 12 great throwing to the heisman trophy winner. Considering that, the meeting and white board work has to be top notch. Now someone is drafting for backups. Are you going to take a backup now instead of someone at another position who could be a starter?
I would not draft him don't want the drama
It hurts being humbled but it broadens the perspective...
Not hard to understand.. a team can afford to take a chance on a player in the first 2 rounds with red flags that is NOT a QB... missing on what would be a franchise QB with a early pick can set a team back for years.. Cleveland for example. Miss on a wide receiver or OL.. well there are plenty to get by with.. miss on a QB.. not good.
I’m shocked at how klatt acted on this show!! Rich was the only one that was real. This is blackballing at its finest and it is personal!!!
Andrew Berry is a disgrace of a Gm.. Im Embarrassed to call myself a Browns fan for a number of reasons but there is ZERO logical reason Shaduer Sanders has not been picked by the Browns… at this point I hope he gets drafted I can’t believe what I’m witnessing with this… he can play this is absolutely ridiculous at this point …
Dude in the blue suit is the informant, he came to bring the message from the league, “they want Shedeur to beg “.. Not a snow ball chance in hell will that be happening. 😂😂😂😂😂 Everyone and anyone knows by now he is being blackballed.  But watch how God, not man turn it all around in his favor. No body is begging to sit at a table that they should have been invited to.
"That is the conversation of this draft to this point."  Ummmm...Because you all keep focusing on Sanders the whole friggin draft process.
Ask the stand up, ultimate character guy Tim Tebow, if bringing too much attention will turn a team off. Now add a huge ego and a vocal father who will always have a camera in his face. I wonder what turned teams off.
Self reflection that’s so disrespectful very disrespectful Joel is so wrong
Klatt is a self righteous clown. Rich is damn right!  He’s young enough to make it big in the league. Humble is code for stay in your lane.
He should have gone number 1. This is the bigget black ball in sports history
Who is this dude in the blue!! You want him to beg are you serious!!!
10:22 That's a good question. Whatever the problem they have with him, clearly, it's not pick value... the problem will persist tomorrow, it won't change a thing if you pick him round 1 or round 7.
I'm not surprised that he slid to day 3. I'm surprised Milroe and Gabriel went before him. He was after Dart and Shough to me (not that my opinion matters). I'm high on McCord, too, but Sanders is definitely ahead of the two guys who went in round 3.
Joel was spot on. Sanders not going in the 1st round was due to talent. Him not going in the 2nd or 3rd round was 100% based on character and the circus that comes with him. No team/org wants the dad of the back up to have the voice/pull that would come with Shedeur and Dion. Parents will always be tougher than others on their kids growing up but they will also always prop up their own kids higher than they should, prime example being retiring Shedeurs # at CU after 2 seasons with nothing to show for it from the view of Shedeur. Love Dion and what he has done with Jackson State and now CU but there is a massive difference between Shedeur and Travis Hunter. Dion has done his own kid a disservice by trying to compare him with someone who is leagues ahead of him.
@4:15 💯💯💯💯
God?? God likely does not care about football
Shadeur is the best QB in this draft. If Joe Burrow can be a pocket passer and go number 1 overall, this fall for Sanders is for sure personal.
The cowboys will draft him in the end; if no one bites.
Excuses, excuses, excuses, that’s all I hear to not draft this young man. Some say he has talent, while others say he not as talented as the QBs before him. Some say it’s because he’s not humble but embrace he’s never been in trouble. There’s zero reason why he shouldn’t have already been drafted. He should never beg for any job. Just go out there and ball. Oh by the way, yes he is getting blackballed
Rich risen is on the right track, but poppa sanders is just another excuse … confidence,star attitude and white #22 pick “Johnny manziel”Confidence, star attitude and Black, not a combo for the “old timey” league owners ….. let’s be honest
LMAO - He's rich all ready. - They acting like he lives on the street begging for a Tent and Cheeseburger. SMH
These guys should lose their jobs. They got it wrong on Shadookie.   Not even close.
Anyone think it’s a God thing?! Sanders believe and nfl,don’t
Pride goeth before a fall.  EVERYBODY goes before Shedeur.
Shedeur is going to get a draft call but it’s going to be from The Rock and the UFL/XFL
Serious question…did I just miss something?  What did Shedeur do that was so egregious that 32 owners are seemingly pulling a Kaepernick on this guy in the draft.  What did I miss, cause being cocky can’t be it especially since he’s still essentially a college player and they always give them a pass at that age saying that they’re still kids and they will grow up. Not to mention he’s Prime’s son so being cocky or flashy is just a given like the Manning boys are always professional.
It just shows that GMs in this league are still a good ol boys club. The Browns are a pathetic franchise btw
UDFA.
Watching the media analysts tip-toe around being too critical of Shedeur feels exactly like watching them talk about Bronny. The hype was 75% who their father is
Naw im not begging when my talent and criminal record is good enough.
8:10 yup, that is exactly why. Deion will run his mouth and it will be a circus. Rich cant be that blind to it. If things dont go well, this family has the potential to rip your team apart.
Rich, apologize for all owners.
They marketed him as a star, they sold him as a star during the draft process, as soon as he slipped out of the first round no one is going to draft him as a backup with little incentive to develop him if he’s on a round 4-7 pick contract, his marketing team owns the blame
Klatt said nothing but bullshit.
Rich embarrassed himself with this take. Dude is so biased about this it's insane.
If Sheduer wasn’t a Sanders would he even be talked about? How many are that play on mediocre .500 teams over 2 years?
Salute to Rich for speaking out on this bullshit. 📠✊🏾
a lot of haters onn here... yuck!!!
Johnny Manziel… Tebow…
Sanders is not that good also no NFL team wants him with the Circus 🎪 that Follows him around everywhere
Rich is capping for the Sanders family and it's getting borderline uncomfortable
I watched a few games of the kid and some interviews. Looks like bias or they dont like his confidence\lack of humility.
Oh wait, wait, wait…. The media was wrong? What? That doesn’t happen does it?…. Bunch of twats on TV, we’re over it!!!
Absolutely loved hearing Rich speak his mind right after the draft without pulling any punches!!!! Top tier work sir, not just a pundit but a journalist; truly one of the greats! 3:03
Problem is at best he was a 3rd round backup, but you don't want don't want a 3rd round backup who is a circus act. Who knows how far he falls now.
Nah. Homie was on that bullshit. Rich was right. You want to talk about QBs with red flags? Mike Vick? Big Ben? DASHAUN? Ryan Leaf? Tua (concussions)? Aaron Rodgers (right now)? Kurt Cousins (overall)?   This felt pretty personal. I have never seen someone so highly rated by everyone in the sports broadcasting business get blasted down so far without injury concerns.
i don't understand Eisen's stroke fest with Sanders.  how can he now understand and/or see what other people are telling him day in and day out about him.  His talent is average, he played in a bad conference, went .500, no bowl wins, etc ... he is massively entitled, and thinks b/c of his name he can demand and expect the world without earning it.  then the circus that follows him everywhere, and his dad likely clanging symbols around ... and the rumors of his tanking of all the interviews by multiple sources.  Yet Rich just comes to the defense like it's his own child or something, i don't get it.
The cameras got nothing to do with them not drafting Miss Sanders key. That’s just another excuse the cameras the coach can tell him no that’s easy. They trying to get back at Deion Sanders. It’s all racial related and collusion.
What a Shame! I'm not looking at  no More Games if Shadore doesn't get drafted!
Already in the HOF, already has the bust made sideshow.
Rich is clueless on Sanders.
Shedeur got blackballed
I can't believe they didn't say it was racism or some other load of nonsense like that
Rich still carrying water for his boy Deion
So.. When Aaron Roger's shows up to a team with his circus show, it's no problem???
Of course it’s personal. They absolutely don’t like his person, period! He’s set the table himself by his arrogant self centered persona. He is who he is, a legend in his own mind. Undeserved accolades like having his number retired don’t help.
This was the most cringe worthy draft to watch in recent history. Every other pick was "Where is Sanders going to go?" when you're not focusing more attention on the players that are actually getting drafted and that are THANKFUL for that opportunity. Sanders isn't even there and you're wasting your time talking about him every two minutes. Spend more time talking about the players that actually deserve to be talked about. You beat the Sanders conversation into the ground. You're not talking teams into drafting him.
This is a QB that had 13W - 11L while at Colorado. Travis Hunter carried a mediocre QB., plain and simple. Shedeur will be an effective CFL QB no matter how hard the national narrative media pushes a fraud.
Listen !!! The NFL is teaching The sanders a lesson. They saw what the NBA and LeBron did with Bronny and they said this won’t happy to us. Nepotism. They don’t like Deion, they don’t want Shedeur in the locker room or the distractions. This is sad. It’s embarrassing. But Deion caused this
Damn Joel. You sold out at the end. Sad. Daniel on some goofy stuff with the beg comment.
Baker Mayfield was a cocky jerk, got arrested had bad interviews but went first overall.    Maybe Sheduer should have been white and he  would have been drafted within the first 34 picks because that's what his rank was.
Funny how they don’t mention that Shadeur threw his Colorado teammates under the bus on national TV multiple times, which is a major red flag when it comes to leading a team.
Rich is taking this way to personal and couldn’t talk about anything after the segment on Shedeur, he was fuming
Pick up the phone and beg? Absolutely not!
Sanders is a legend all right😂
Rich has been ridin with the Sanders family since day 1. You gotta respect that! Klatt always throwing shade on the Sanders’
The perfect guy to make an example out of
Y'all need to stop criticizing Rich. He has a point. There have been dudes with worse character or have been in trouble with law enforcement that have been drafted high over the years
Why do I feel like this whole scenario is going to take an ugly turn?  Racism, NFL collusion, social media overexposure.  This could go real sideways.
As much as I disagree with him here rich is a ride or die homie for his boy Deion
Majority of teams already have their QB.
There's a disconnect when the arm doesn't equal the arrogance.
Never seen Rich like this.
All this attention on sanders is WHY he has not been drafted yet.
It’s not about race or collusion. None of the teams want the circus that comes with Sanders.
Who ever gets him I hope every team who passed on him regrets it.
The problem is Dion.   No coach or GM wants to be getting calls from Deon Sanders telling them how to run their organization
IDC what you say in what world is Gabriel, shough, milroe, Dart better than him. This is absolutely a personal thing. Pittsburgh being Rodger’s b***h is ridiculous why wait for that guy. They should have been grabbed Sheduer. This is insanely ridiculous. He might have brought it on himself but like rich said this dude has all the talent and no crazy off field issues.
Why are they so concerned with his humility?
The sanders camp made a statement in the beginning pick him you get a winner and a coach
Maybe he took a knee and we all missed it?🤔🤔  We really should organize an immediate charity draft for a family recruit, self-entitled and media overhyped player  But in seriousness, IMO he should start learning Canadian, the league there will be starting soon ..........
FINALLY THE RACIST OWNERS GETTING SMART LOL
He will be this years Mr Irrelevant  (but only by pick)
Rich looking like a complete fool in his feelings about Sanders, sorry your buddies kid didn’t get drafted early, but you’re sounding delusional about it
I think that the whole drama train attached to the Sanders Family has had a huge affect on this nonsense.
This isn't a coronation If a team believes a player gives them the best chance for winning that's what they'll will decide. It's not Sanders fault that his father and the media deluded his thinking. Professional life is hard and while their are some advantages of nepotism it can also create a stumbling block when the decision making is no longer in the hands of the family.
Sanders is not that good
DJ said “just beg”.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
It's typical NFL, he should go to Canada!
Teams don't want to deal with the drama of the Sanders family, which is guaranteed to follow with Deion .
Maybe Shedeur wasn't that good 🤔 Who could have guessed this, besides people who watched big 12 football last year
I agree with Klatt completely
Key word Beg. No! All black players need to step up NOW!!!
I’m watching ESPN right now and they are loving this I think I’m a be a bit more selective about what I watch regarding the NFL or maybe not at all
Ryan Leaf and Rodgers were considered A-holes coming out the draft ..still went in first round. It's personal. Can't be Black and highly confident.
I Beg of you to give me an opportunity..? 🤔 foh!
He can also be hired as an assistant coach at Colorado.
This some bs I swear
DJ lost sooo many points with me.  It's almost like he's a part of the narrative 🤔
I'd like to see him come back to college and play for Syracuse - we're losing Kyle McCord later in the draft most likely.  But I know this will never happen 😅
I don’t care what the media is saying. We’re watching modern day buck breaking in real time!! They want to show all of these kids they can have all the motion they want, but they better still be willing to bow down!  They want to devalue that man! They want to strip him down as much as they can. We’re talking about someone that has Gatorade and Nike endorsements before they get to the league. Those are usually incentives they dangle in order to be able to manipulate contracts. What do you give someone that has it all? The @NFL’s answer seems to be nothing at all if you want to control them.  Rich knows what’s up!
Rich worked with deion so completely biased. 32 teams aint passing on him for three rounds for no reason.
brady knows his him best
Rich is keeping it realistic 💯 America don't  like strong Black man. 😢
I thought Shadeurs freestyle at his Draft party was solid. Maybe liangelo part 2?
This is all Dieons fault for not closing his mouth
Coach Prime got his son financially and probably told his son it’s best to go later in the draft process because he has been in his shoes before and understands he doesn’t need that added pressure right away that comes with being a starter or face of franchise.
Major league headache 😫 just trying to sign this guy. Who needs ya.
Teams do not want the circus that he and his clown father will bring. The stress to the coach, the GM, and the starting QB that he will bring is not worth it. He's never had another coach other than his dad in his ear, so coachablity is a question. The back up QB having a circus his never a good look. His dad screwed him over even before he had a chance.
Jerry Jones is going to draft Shedeur now as a favor then Jerry will come out and say “ We can’t believe he fell to us, we couldn’t pass up this opportunity even though Dak is our starter..he’s great, he’s this, he’s that and should of been a first round pick.”..Also this is going to be bad for Colorados recruiting
At this point it's not even football. Except Travis, all other Colorado players are still on the board. I think the message is clear.
We coming!   We coming.
he acts like a kid with a rich daddy cuz thats what he is. he dont even try to hide it...
His dad raised him And coached him..  His dad takes half the blaim .
yall have the answer just one folks dont wanna be honest about... he black confident and unapologetic about being himself... one of the interviewer said "he makes you feel small" 😐 sounds like a bunch of insecure no confidence having idiots are doing these interviews and cant accept this kid isnt bowing down to the perceived "power" they think they have over him
GO BaCk tO sChool SANDERS AnD OUT PLAY aRch mAnniNg MAKE tHe NfL cOme Out The CLoset NexT DraFt SIMPLY GO OUT PLAY arch nExT yEar
It's bigger than football.. the kids can clearly play. He was no lower than top 20 overall in most people's big board.. then you got players that were projected in the 100's and 80's that were picked ahead of him.. it was a clear hit job
Dion said his son was a top 5 player but what he forgot to mention is that he was referring to the UFL
The name Sanders come with some badges and the NFL teams do not want to deal with it. Good luck to him though
Johnny Manziel and Tim Tebow were picked in round 1.  The move continues to show why the NFL is a gimmic
Klatt: "QB is different w red flags" Meanwhile: Johnny Manziel, took illegal funds partied, never studied film, did drugs and got picked rd.1"
now they say he gotta beg to play 😒
Dude, he isnt that good. Get over it.
The fact you're making such a drama out of this is exactly the problem.........
Charles was pissed that Sanders wasn’t pick. And others was.
Shadeur is good. And will prove people wrong. I can't wait to see it. That's all I want to say.
The raiders had like 6 chances to take him and said naw. Atleast with cam Newtown and his pomp he would produce, sanders isn't gunna produce no one wants a teddy Bridgewater with an attitude
He wasn’t good enough. You guys are too close to him to be objective about it. No quality QB Rolex watch cellys vs CSU!
Very disappointed with Rich. He’s pushing a narrative which it feels like he was paid to push. Why would anyone want a semi talented punk qb setting fire to their locker room ? Rich is walking a very dangerous path here. Keep your professional dignity or you lose viewers respect for good
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing"   👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Rich‼️‼️‼️
Rich, maintain your objectivity.
I think the advice is good. Reach out to the teams.
Rich Eisen is coping so hard. 😂😂 He can’t grasp that the backup QB Sanders & his dad will be telling Tv cameras he should be starting. Lol
Rich and company needs to stop. Sanders hasn't got drafted because of his attitude and self righteous and an arrogant.
He said he should basically beg to be in the league. Man forget ALL of that. Thank god his play has already warranted millions, partnerships and more. He’s already a success story, regardless of this draft and this obvious bs.
WHY DIDNT JERRY JONES TAKE HIS NEXT GEN PRIME PLAYER ???  C'MON JERRY ....GET YOUR NEXT QB   PRIME JR
Y'all missing Rich's point. Some going on.
Sanders deserves a spot on a team!
shedeur thinks he's a QB1, if they pick him now, he will be a major distraction. Say what you want about Milroe - I'd rather have him than Shedeur because he doesn't have a reality show and a father who is as cocky as Lavar Ball.
His father is partly to blame for this.  All that yapping cost his son.  Didn't Deion basically say not too long ago that he would reject certain teams from drafting his kid?  All teams collectively said "f you" and didn't draft his kid.
Rich Eisen is still pimping Shedeur Sanders.
Rich is the Bill Burr of sports media.
Two reasons he wasn't drafted.  1.  His father.  2.  His attitude.  Did I mention his father.
This man telling Shedeur to beg to be drafted is crazy like shut up
Did this batch just say I beg of you? Lmao oh wow😮
Let's be honest: there just aren't many teams that NEED a young, starting QB this year! Shedeur isn't terrible, but he's middle-of-the-road talent and NOT starting NFL QB material. So, why are we so shocked that he's yet to be picked? Look at the teams that picked QBs. The only one that will start is Cam Ward (unless Dart impresses in a big way). I've seen so many talking heads gab and gab during the draft, but they fail to mention that this is NOT a QB-needy draft and that is what's really having a HUGE effect on whether or not Sanders would get picked in the earlier rounds.
I like what DJ was saying but he would also have to plead with teams about how involved his dad would be. Or rather, how NOT involved he should be. And his dad has been on TV, more than once, literally saying that there are certain teams he won’t let him go to. 😂 I mean dude come on!!!! Nobody was out there speaking for Travis hunter, no matter how close he is with prime. Surely, this has everything to do with Deion and also Sheduer’s cockiness. Trying to tell teams that they need him. Rather than the other way around.
Rich Eisen is a Karen  He’s not that good get over yourselves
I’m just really glad the broadcast in my area, the one with Saban on it, has not been obsessing over Sanders falling
The Sanders' are arrogant and no one wants to deal with Deion's meddling and over bearing attitude. You just know he and his kid are going to be a distraction anywhere Sheduer goes.
This is kind of what happened with Colin Kaepernick.  He just wasn’t good enough that the teams were willing to deal with all the noise and potential problems he brought with him.
Dallas will take him if he’s available next pick guarantee
appreciate the camera man getting the fireworks in the shot. they were nice to look at
All these evaluators, insiders, mock drafters, etc., are going to be eating crow for years on this one.
Shaduer is not going to call teams and beg them wtf these guys are idiots
This is a legit story.  I understand why the sports media is talking about it because we haven't seen anything like this before.
Rich, stop it.. you are embarrassing yourself.. no objectivity
That’s really crazy thinking by all of you.. You’re saying that the commissioner knows about hundreds of coaches, GM’s, owners got all together and agreed to blackball Sanders? That’s so way out it’s crazy..  think about it..
Settle down Rich. He's not even close to worth his red flags. The kid has never played for an actual coach. I wouldn't touch him
He not getting drafted....im not sure he gets signed as an unrestricted F/A.
This Is A Kaepernick Case Concerning Shedure Sanders ❤
Sanders dad is toxic. And Scheduer is really not that great.  I'd rather take Dillon Gabriel. Had better stats than Nix
Regardless of it being true or not, Rich is brave for pointing this out on live television. The NFL as an organization should not be playing personal vendetta. It needs to be better
It's a shame Rich is shilling for his friend Deion.  The MEDIA (like Rich) created the hype train in Colorado (which though better hasn't won jack).  Sanders didn't do well in his one Bowl game either.  Shedeur was EIGHTH  in the Heisman vote...well behind the ARMY QB (who hasn't been drafted either).  The Sanders family COMPLETELY MISJUDGED his talent and value to NFL teams.  The other commentators are right, no one wants a pain in the arse distraction from the 3rd string developmental QB (and his family).  They want a humble young man that knows he's got a lot to learn and do before maybe getting his shot.  ONLY SEVEN TEAMS might have been in the market for a QB (after Ward was taken) ...and only 2-3 were looking for potential starters.  After NYG chose Dart, it was down to Cleveland, Pitt, and NOLA...and obviously they weren't impressed enough to seem him as a clear franchise QB.  Why is this a mystery to people?
This draft has been the most embarrassing  draft ever witnessing in history.....The NFL franchise has definitely gone down bad with how you have handle this young man so unprofessional.🤢🤮🤮🤮
I went to watch Shedeur interviews dude sounds arrogant as hell. That’s no confidence talking 😅 go watch it’s on YouTube
call and beg n plea to them?? hell nah
Literally not that many are interested why this kid was not drafted . We are more interested in the drafted players .
Nobody talking about Quinn?
To these NFL coaches and general managers, "control", being safe and keeping their jobs is their #1 priority. These people are not believers or risk takers. And they're definitely not going to gamble on their early draft picks for a very high status potential franchise QB if they can't control him. Hence, this is the reason why Shedeur is keeping slipping in the draft...
Legal proceedings forthcoming
This is the dumbest panel on this topic I ever seen
Rich STOOD ON BIZNESS!!!
Shadeur should have had an agent that was well connected to all these GMS. I think that was his first mistake trying to save 2% commission or whatever it is.
Dallas duh Sanders - 2~21
And You Guys supposed to be experts ! No Head Coach in the NFL wants to be Second guest Coaching from His Dad ! When He sucks , ole Daddy will be out there running His Mouth ! Forget all that Noise !
It was the prophecy told long ago. He was always meant to be controversial
Stephen A Smith and Deion Sanders will have their own personal lockers with whatever team that draft Shedeur
God for rich Eisen, Joe Klatt, your gutless and shameless. There’s nothing to push back on on that issue. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t be shallow and absolutely heartless on one side and then wanted to defend it for other players with ridiculous red flags. That’s inconsistent and hypocritical bs.
This is simple. Shedeur = trust fund black with a very influential father. Ward and Milroe = coming from a low to middle income family. NFL owners prefer blacks in the second category because they are easier to control and manipulate.
Its his attitude and all the comments his father made to the media about who he would and would not play for. At this point, the risk is much lower and a team should just grab him already and if he hasnt been humbled by this, they can cut him with little consequence
Rich is only defending his friend’s son. I would do the same thing.
This is purely defamation of character
This has become personal.  At this point, no matter who chooses him, they will get a very vindictive player.  Can you imagine calling him acting like you are excited to be drafting him after 4 rounds.  I honestly dont think he will be drafted at all at this point.
At this point, Rich is Kanye and Deion is the Cousin.
Sheduer might not get drafted...and it won't be hard to figure why; it's because of dad. Yes the kid has attitude, and that did a little damage; but no coach wants to teach a kid how to play in the NFL with dad in his ear telling him not listen to them and that they are dumb.....which is what he will do. I also think that the League has a LONG memory and Dion's list of people he has pissed off over the years is even L O N G E R.
Sanders and B James gonna be best of friends
The NFL needs a rival league then BS like this would stop because it will be squarely talent for drafting.
Shedeur didn't attend the draft combine why? He's got to look at himself and ask himself why
WHO? NAME THE TEAM HE SHOULD GO TO? He doesn't fit into any roster situation, unless he'd proudly lead the scout team but that ain't happening. He thinks WAY too highly of himself.
Dear Stephen a ryan Clark Mel kiper this is how you have a civil conversation about this
NFL about to hit Rich Eisen with a fine 😂
Yo, unless he like spit in one of these owners faces or something, I don’t wanna hear this foolishness. This humbling ideology should be seen as like hazing or bullying of some sort. This makes no sense whatsoever. You have dudes with domestic abuse charges with everything the leagues image has gone through. He’s a better look for your organization than a kid with self-confidence ? This is absolutely ridiculous and there’s no logical reason to explain it. I hate all the race baiting, but this behavior doesn’t beat the slave master name tag that owners and front offices get.I love football so much but the NFL disgust me with this behavior. Shame on you. Money does change what type of humans you are. You think this kid was felon the way there treating him.
Baker Mayfield, Jonny Football, Eli Manning and many other cases of red flags in qbs entering the draft. Sanders has one of the highest characters of any player this class. Don’t tell me it’s different for qbs. This is an embarrassment from the NFL. This is not a reflection of Sanders but a projection from the league. His talent alone is clearly better than most of QBs chosen before him. This is truly a shame.
At this point you do have to wonder what that Sanders interview with the teams that were looking at quarterbacks was like that he has fallen this far. We'll probably only ever get rumors, but it had to be horrible.
Who cares. Really I’m not losing any sleep what about you…
Calling GM's pleading is crazy nasty work
Even they know it's collusion. They just can't say it
Tim McCarver laughing up in heaven as he looks down on this and thinking karma !!! 😂
There are other drafted men you could talk about besides this same story for the 100th time
Rich can’t cope!😂
I do not understand how so many people can look at his play and see a good quarterback. Dudes stats were padded by screen passes to the single generational talent in this draft at 3 x the rate of any other team in a single season, ever.
Rumor is the GMs & NFL owners are mad because Shedeur phuck’d they bishes 😂. Legendary
Yeah I get the feeling it's a personal thing.
Said this on another vid but, Just think of this concept and I'm just repeating something someone else said and it makes sense "If his last name wasn't Sanders how many would really be talking about him" Being the son of an NFL legand gave him instant notarity, Yes, he's a talented athlete and QB and has potential but I do have to agree with the statement.
Sanders has been OVERRATED and OVERHYPED from the very beginning by the media. He isn't as good as everyone thinks he is...
Ohhh poor poor Shedeur, this is so terrible. He comes from an insanely rich family, and he's got a few million in pocket change himself just from NiL, but anal-ysts are sooo bent out of shape with their grandstanding about the "injustice" of the guy not being drafted yet. Hey, Spencer Rattler has a far better arm, is just as accurate and just as mobile, and excelled against MUCH tougher competition in college and he didn't go until the 5th Round last season. If teams, don't think you're a guaranteed starter they don't want to drop first round money on you, especially if you have a dad who is going to try to strong-arm them in negotiations.
Here's what possibly could be happening: He comes off as arrogant, which is much stronger than confidant. Normally that might not be a major problem but in his case it could be because executives may believe that his arrogance could translate into being uncoachable since the only person to ever coach him is his father.
The NFL owners got together to teach a Confident black man a lesson just they like they did for Kapernek. F the NFL. Sanders should say F the NFL and go play in one of the other leagues
tebow got black balled bc of the circus in a good way. sheduer unfortunately is the circus the same way as kaepernick. unfortunate he is this big a tool. really tells you how awful he was in the interviews
As if 32 team owners, GMs, and coaches got together and decided to freeze him out. First, less than half the teams needed a QB, Secondly, is he as good as many think? Some experts say no. Thirdly, if he did to other teams what he did to the Giants, that is why he is sitting at home. So there is a question about his talent, the entire league wasn't an option, and he possibly conducted himself like a jerk. Done.
Shedeur Sanders is no less than the 2nd best qb in this draft.  Something stinks to high heaven
Telling him to call GMs is crazy. Isn’t that what the entire pre draft process is for? The combine, the pro days, and the pre draft interviews are just as much about character evaluation as they are talent evaluation. Prospects know that going into draft season and from some reports Sheduer clearly did not value how his personal character was perceived by teams. He made his bed and now it’s time to sleep in it. He had all off season to solidify himself in the draft, but now cause he’s slipping he should call and plead that he should be picked?
AS I RECALL SEVERAL MONTHS AGO ... DEION SANDERS DOING AN INTERVIEW ... SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE A SAY....IN WHOEVER HIS SON PLAYED FOR .....LIKE HE COULD PICK AND  CHOOSE WHAT TEAM HE WOULD ALLOW TO DRAFT HIS SON....YEP ....LOOKS LIKE DAD AINT MADE UP HIS MIND YET ....😂😂😂😂😂
No David Duke you are happy with what is happening
Being drafted is a privilege, not a right. Rich needs to get off his soapbox
Rich, you have become everything wrong with modern day sports media. Get over yourself.
3-4th round talent with a camera crew will get you picked in the 6-7th round
I would LOVE it if Titans would draft Shedeur as backup QB.  They’re gonna need one and the drama would be AMAZING!
Joel Klatt is a flat out hater
I'm glad we took Dart over Sanders. I never thought he was that good from the beginning.
Dak prescott went in the fourth he’s the best QB from his class and made bank..Sanders will be alright this will make him better
Johnny Manziel got drafted.. I’m confused
The “30 for 30” is already in the works….
I recently started watching Rich's show, but if this is the hill he's going to die on, I might have to pass on it. Shedeur just isn't worth it, 32 teams agree.
What a reality check for him. Love to see it
Joel heard something and isn’t saying it, his tone from day one shifted a lot!
Dude next to Rich is FOS! It was a rumor spread out about Sanders not performing well in interviews. Bruh I hope he goes to New York and I’m a Falcons fan he was made for that city! The bottom line is they hate to see a black man with confidence!
A pocket qb isn't what the league is looking for anymore. He has a B- arm but very accurate so that will work for him. He will go to a team with a starter that has similar characteristics. Not many of them out there with mostly pocket qbs.  Does the league humble players? Absolutely. Not just big names but all players. The backup distraction is a real thing. Maybe he needs to go be a backup like Jimmy G did and get moved like that. Like a backup to burrow or tua. He will be fine
Lol he had to humbled
How cute Rich is protecting his friends/co-workers son 😊
Rich over here tying himself in knots trying to avoid reality. Sanders isnt that good and has a horrible attitude nobody likes. Quit trying to make him avoid accountability
It seems Shedeur was gaslit by the media early on with projections of being a top 3 pick. He compiled his hype early prior to the combine and decided he was too high value to take the potential risk of lowering his stock. I believe he's generally not arrogant, based on what we see on youtube, but he probably did botch his interviews by letting himself too loose with expectations. Only a handful of teams need a quarterback, so making a good impression is necessary. You don't do yourself any favors by being selective yourself and boldly signalling it. The other issue is that the media has followed Shedeur the whole year, while the NFL only during this draft process. The NFL is telling us what they've seen from him in the past few months, which all adds up.
A couple of calls made??  These clowns just don’t want to admit this is blackballing and collusion by the NFL….
Rich is Woke or Dark Woke.
Yall got the answer
Preach Rich!!
Shedoor is a scrub. Padded his stats with WR screens and passes at or behind the LOS. Played two decent teams in 2025 and lost to both. The “well off media” crew can suck it.
Shedeur has never endured the stress of earning a starting QB job in college.  He never endured the stress of possibly getting benched at any time during college.  He's talented no doubt, but  If he had a different last name would we even be having this conversation?  In High School & Pop Warner football that's called Daddy Ball.  Clearly, the NFL execs don't feel he's endured an adequate share of adversity to know how he's going to react without Dad there to protect him.
Rich always plays the white guy guilt crap, herd is worse.
bullshit. he is undrafted because he is arrogant and not a top quarterback
No Self Respecting Black Man is going to beg a White dude for a job...If you're flashy be flashy... If you're humble stay humble... But respect me as a Man and you will get 110% from me.... If they send a message to Black men.... We can send a message back... All talented Black students transfer to HBCU's... And let's form our own Football league 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Them arguing about the player proves the point that he is bad for the locker room.
LMAO 🤣 He ain't flexing 💪 that watch ⌚ NOW!!!! Shiloh will get drafted before Shedeur!! 😂
They put him up on that whiteboard and he started spitting like Jamarcus Russell
Dude is nothing without the last name. The privilege finally caught up to him
Rich is in his feelings because Deion is his friend.
Rich is taking this personally 😂
Glad Rich Eisen didn't sugar coat and was real about the league faking about character issues but still drafting people anyways and people using character issues as scapegoats.
cmon now. if you’re defending this as being justifiable, you’re crazy. we’ve seen teams pick players, QBs even, with way worse off the court issues. This has to be personal. If you ask me, I think a lot of it has to do with Deion, unfortunately.
Players shouldn't have any say where they play. It's a draft. And sanders wasn't drafted because he is cocky and didn't prove anything. Mid. Riding his father's name.
Sanders was a media creation, that simple. He’s mediocre, at best. And has personality issues. The NFL GM’s spoke loud and clear, he’s not worth it. Far better and more accomplished QB’s got passed up too, like Ewers from UT. But that’s not a story…
Guess all the “haters” and the billionaire NFL owners are right, nobody wants an entitled, selfish, arrogant, better-than-everyone attitude dude as a franchise player. Have fun being a backup and maybe a chance starter.
Will Shiloh get drafted before Shedeur? 😂
NFL flexing their power once again. They’re making a point that nobody is bigger than the program. This has NOTHING to do with football. They’re just showing who is in control.   People are running with fake narratives of “attitude” and “character” issues and can’t name examples. And even if that were true, that has nothing to do with production. It’s 100% personal for the entire Sanders family. Team owners don’t want to had the keys to their franchise to the Sanders.
His whole crew includes… one of the best players in NFL history. Not many draft prospects have had to factor that in.
All I heard was that the league plan was to humble a young man because of what?
If Sheduar out performs the QB’s drafted ahead of him the GM’s should be fired..
There’s no “rest of the story” lol the teams don’t view him as a starter.
Beg??!!3😂😂😂
NFL is about shut up and run mentality
4:00 this is why he isn’t getting drafted. The president was tweeting about him. No team wants that media storm for a low ceiling, high floor guy. He’ll be better than Gabriel easy but the headache isn’t worth the squeeze
No he shouldn't have to do that" he    played hard and was tough in the pocket" no why should he be humble when its not pose to be personal " sound like some one big got their ego bruised and taking it out personal  agenda" NO HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BOW DOWN IF ITS REALLY ALL ABOUT TALENT "  STOP PUMP-FAKING " ACTING LIKE NO ONE KNOWS THE ISSUE " THE PROLEM IS OLD ITS JUST PACKAGED DIFFERENT """
Every stream and station I watched were hyping Sanders and "shocked" he was not taken.
I'm prett sure MOST of us know what they are thinking.
Rich and Deion are close, so I get how this effects him
Man Rich, Mike Tomlin and the Steelers is definitely not the example you should be using. Tomlins been plagued by lockerroom drama and distractions for two decades
“QB is different” like baker mayfield and Jonny manziel weren’t the drunkest guys ever drafted.
wtf rich was pissed
Maybe spend some time on the players that actually got drafted, ya?
Four QB's have been drafted through the first three rounds, as well as 98 other players; but we're only going to talk about one undrafted player. Perhaps the teams know something the prognosticators don't. If he's truly that great, he will eventually be selected; but, how many other projected starting QB's are no longer relevant to a starting lineup in the NFL? There's always someone "who can play" that just do not cut the mustard. We'll see - the NFL is not the NCAA.
His dad has a GOLD jacket hall of famer Man this is disrespectful to him and his kids
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣legendary🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 there is nothing more fun to do on the internet than shitting on steven segal and dion sanders kidz😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣  This football panel is losing their mind because dion sanders son didn’t get picked in the first three rounds 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Damn good unbiased commentary and analysis.
Have you guys seen his celebration party? No team wants that as a QB in the NFL especially when hes not all that talented
It's obvious it's a snub. Drafting lower level QBs only hurts the team and the decisions makers lose their jobs.
Sanders doesn’t need the NFL. American is under judgment anyway.
3:45 just because you have the ability to solve a problem doesn’t mean you want a problem. I have cold medicine. I still don’t want to catch a cold.
The nfl is full of crap, period
He's not a worthy employee.  He's arrogant, prideful and selfish.  The NFL doesn't want that dude.  He's a bum.
We can be pretty sure of one thing, each owner coach team wants to win.  There is no collusion.
Breaking News..... Las Vegas Raiders will select Shadeur Sanders at 108...... Welcome to the NFL Sanders
For the first time in his life, he will have to earn his spot. The NFL is telling him that no one can save him but himself. He’s going to have to prove himself.
It's not the league sending a message to Shedeur, it's the receipt of the message both he AND his Dad have been pitching. Deion was Prime Time... not his son. He played "well" in a so-so conference but he didn't "shut down half the field in Super Bowls"... He was sure pitched as if he did... But he's not yet done diddly-squat. They over marketed him as though he'd already accomplished things, and that gives teams the cause to pause. Dad should have stayed out of the whole "going pro" process and let the kid fly or fall, on his own. I'm sure he will go on day 3.
Every team in the NFL knows one thing, if things go badly with Shedeur then the questions start to fly. Is it the team, or is it Shedeur? And you gotta know that Coach Prime isn't going to let ANYONE blame the Sanders "brand" for any failure, and THAT is the circus, THAT is the noise the teams don't want to deal with.   It's not hard to comprehend. It's not that teams don't think they couldn't keep issues in house. It's becuase  they KNOW they can't get Deion to keep his mouth shut, even for the benefit of his own son. And so, because Deion is a know it all, if Shedeur should ever show any sign of failure, you best believe Prime is pinning the blame on ANYONE and EVERYONE without a last name that starts with Sanders, and THAT kind of poison will KILL your team. Hell, it might not even take Deion to do it, we all watched Shedeur throw his entire oline under the bus after a loss.   Deion from the outside blaming everyone, on whichever team, for his sons failure, telling the coach how to coach, or the GM how to GM, which he WOULD do if things were to go badly, is not worth it for a kid who is a mid-level NFL QB talent.   It's really not that hard to understand guys. I'm sorry, but it's not.
Shedeur "ALL HYPE" Sanders HAHAHA
The truth is out. A guy who has only been coached by his father might not be coachable.
Is Rich in Primes pocket. Haha
After 3rd round, all 32 teams passed on Sanders.  They all can't be wrong or racist.  So, Sanders needs to look in the mirror.
He wasn’t drafted because of his talent, or lack there of. All these shows are just trying to make him seem greater than what he actually is, which is a back up if not, a third string quarterback right now. He’s got a weak arm, he’s not fast, and he’s not quick. His stats were padded by having an elite, superstar, receiver, and playing in a conference known for having terrible defenses. Him slipping past the first and second round was not surprising to anyone who knows the game. He’ll get drafted in the fourth round hopefully to a team that has a dome and a starting QB already he can sit behind for one or two years. His ceiling is a starting quarterback, who makes a few pro bowls as an alternate.
8:16 True good point…But does a team really want to waist energy and time dealing with it 🤔
this is a case of media getting too involved... and the NFL says no thank you.
IDC if this mane bombed every interview, this mane is a winner.  Teams draft players with red flags all day.
Charles Davis a hater
Rich's biases are making his opinions completely weightless.
As Harry Truman said when asked why he didn't trust JFK :" It's not the son, it's the daddy."
Pre draft Deion basically said he will refuse certain teams drafting Sheduer and pull a Manning  Teams said ok we won't draft you
Watching Rich do mental gymnastics to protect the Sanders family is almost painful. He wouldn’t do this for any other QB that’s still on the board going into Day 3.

Shedeur should pull off a Warren Moon.
Shedeur being passed for dart, shough, milroe, and Gabriel is some nasty stuff. He must have told teams he doesn’t wanna play for them and they said “aight bet, have fun waiting” lol
Call it now  Eagles will get shedeur sander
Not throwing at the combine or pro day is also a factor.
I said he wasn't going on day 2! I was right! He may well end up as Sanders: UDFA
People act like this guy killed someone.  These teams are PETTY as F.  I'm not begging any of these people for anything.  He's deserves a opportunity and he earned that!  Period.  We know what it is!!!
They want Shedeur to kiss the NFL ring, not gonna happen. He will be great with or without the NFL
Shedeur might pull a Brock Purdy and become Mr. Irrelevant!
If Sanders is thinking and 32 teams got together before the draft and decided to teach him a lesson than his EGO is bigger than we think. What a ridiculous statement.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The biggest problem is the same problem Cam Newton had when the Patriots cut him. His presence alone creates a distraction, regardless of anything he does, because his name was as big as it was. Cam couldn’t be a backup, because Cam was too attractive to the media. Even if Cam never talked to the media, the media would be talking about him, at every single opportunity to do so. If you want to know why teams would rather not have Sanders as a backup, ask yourselves as members of the media. Because it is you, the members of the media, who have put him in the position of being too popular to be a backup, when his talent said that he wasn’t currently good enough to walk in as a day 1 starter, for 90% of the teams in the NFL. Now it’s too late, it doesn’t matter if he engages with the media, the media is going to be engaged in creating the distractions anyway.
Rich is making a fool of himself on this.
He’s not gonna get drafted tomorrow . I mean, if you think about it only team that’s left it would even think about taking a quarterback at Pittsburgh.
They built Shadeur up in their own heads, put it on live TV for 2 years and when the NFL said we aren't buying it, they lose their minds
Irs such a disservice what these analysts do to the fan base. Own up to your terrible scouting abilities
Cmon Rich, you really think the Steelers want Sanders after dealing with the AB’s, LeVeon, Martavias Bryant and now Pickens drama queens!? GTFOH
this new cast sucks. The Pat MacAfee show was the best draft show in years
Guys when Deion said his son was a Top 5 draft pick, he meant Top 5 rounds.
Yeah, part of this is his reception who he is I mean, you should not be retiring jersey at Colorado the greatest player ever to play there and you just left. Cause most people don’t like that you’re not in charge until you’re in charge. Leave a message in a lesson. You’re not bigger than a shield and don’t ever believe it. You don’t have a job yet so stop acting like.
Shedeur going to the Jags with Travis would be WILD!
His tweet last night made him fall.
First 12:00 minutes about Sanders
This is a bad look on Rich
Rich was not at his best here. Kind of embarrassing
Rich looking sharp
Nepotism isn’t working S.Sanders. Get on the phone….
Rich is really embarrassing himself over this chump.
And all of these teams make a mistake on who they draft every year.
The Steelers are waiting to hear back from Aaron Rodgers! Aaron Rodgers isn’t a distraction?! Aaron Rodgers has a great attitude?! This is insane
LEGENDARY
Be you Shedeur, don't change
@Rich Eisen where is your confusion coming from? The arrogance pre draft from Deion was palpable...
OTHER RICH U GUYS ARE A JOKE SHEDUR IS A TOOOOOOOOOOP PICK
Rich is emotional
Right on Rich!
What's being done to Shedeur Sanders is completely BS
TOE so Dart, Gabriel over Sheduer?  come on bro, hahaha, they are putting him in his place, this is BS, come on bro,
I dont get the conspiracies.   Ya multiple GMs whos jobs are on the line are passing on a franchise QB because other teams told them to.   Hes not worth the headache
I feel like Rich crossed a line tonight made it personal. I think he’s correct that there is a conspiracy going on. But Rich can’t take sides, unfortunately he made Shedaur almost taboo. I feel like the cowboys or raiders are the only teams that can draft him.
Rich Eisen took a second job as Sanders Family Representative?
Pittsburgh had two picks...and they made the best value....the DL and RB are great picks....STEELERS did very well with all things considered.
Rich has lost me almost entirely on this topic. Show us the check Deion sent you, man. This is sad.
“Quarterbacks are different” LMAOOO tell that to Deshaun Watson, Ben Roethlisberger, James Winston, Johnny Manziel etc NFL employs scumbag QBs all the time and Eisen’s face looked like he wanted to say it
Rich is so far gone here. There are so many potential problems with Deion having input going forward … too many headaches for the coaches and front office.
Nobody wants to draft Deion
I heard nobody went to his birthday party.
No legs, bad short passes, bad pro day. It's not a mystery, the hype of his name did him a disservice for expectations.
Not mad at the Browns.  Sanders didn’t wana come to Cleveland anyway can’t blame him either it is what it is.    Blessed those other players that everyone seems to forget about in the media
Weak arm, slow and holds the ball too long. No physical skill that makes you think he can get better. Stop the whining and playing victim because Deion used to work there.
Johhny Manzel and Baker Mayfield were outta control and neither one of those guys was as good of a passer!! Both got drafted by now! Shedeur is a douche but hes legit and plenty of Douches like the Bosa brothers have been drafted high
Time for experts to figure out why they missed ot so bad
I haven’t been in any rooms. I’m a random fan. If I was an athlete I wouldn’t want to play with or for Shedeur. I don’t have all the words for it. He is a punk. He calls himself legendary. It’s childish. The biggest baddest athletes in the world don’t have time for that type of behavior. This is a man’s game. Shedeur is about himself. These commentators are making it too difficult. Owners, coaches and athletes don’t like him because he is not likable. His talent doesn’t trump his negative intangibles.
I’m sorry your friend’s kid didn’t get drafted Rich, but you gotta calm down
Sounds like Sanders was BLACK BALL TO DAM GOOD AS A PLAYER. DONT GET IT.....
Rich needs to stop talking about other people’s situation and “red flags” when it comes to Shedeur. He’s the one trying to be drafted. He’s the one saying I can be the leader in your locker room and the de facto CEO . Owners of billion dollar organizations don’t want you telling them how to run it.
Nobody wants Deion “Lavar” Sanders second guessing every single they move they make and whispering about replacing them as coach next year
Rich just say you are friends with Deion thats why you glaze Shaduer.
Rich acting like this seems out of character for me.
Shedeur has literally changed two programs and is arguably the best quarterback in class. This is embarrassing for the league and unfortunate/fortunate for him that the awful franchises who need him made the predictably awful decision to pass and maintain their status.
Hey Rich why not comment on “32 mistakes”?

Patriots were 🔥
What head coach wants an extra issue to deal with esp for a mediocre player
Self reflection? come on. He should call and beg? What are we even talking about here?🤣
Rich.. did you take a paycheck, brudda? You're smarter than this. We see through it, man.
Did this mf say for him to beg? Beg for what? Dude was either the best or second best QB. This is the same nfl that paid Kap to keep quiet cause they knew they blackballed him. They had no issue with Eli’s dad said his son was going to teams but the minute a black man does it it’s an issue?
Nfl doesn't like an entitled brat.
Sanders just needs to be humble, maybe SHILO gets drafted before him.
The hate is absolutely crazy
He and his brother were modeling at the gay LV show in Italy or France while their teammates were chopping wood on spring workouts. That whole next level media BS does not work. 😂🎉
Klatt is still salty about his number not being retired. He's the same guy who was singing about Sheduer's talent. Rich knows the family personally so what Klatt is pushing is hate....misguided hate at that...BLAME Rick ( CU AD)  not Deion!
If he had an agent maybe this would not have happened
Personality matters
Deion’s culture is caustic and teams don’t want shedeur to bring that to their locker room.
I think it would have been reasonable for him to be a day 2 guy, but when the story from INSIDE the NFL is told, here’s what you’ll hear:  - They don’t know how much of Sanders’ success was Travis Hunter’s. The talent when the ball was going his way and the chances he opened up needed doubled make it hard to tell.  -Has his father’s confidence, but not his talent. It is wrong for people to compare Sanders to his father, but I think NFL teams  are doing that and to them his persona comes off as arrogant, and you CANNOT be seen as arrogant and not be an undisputed superstar.   -Played C-/B- teams. Lost to some really unimpressive teams.  -Needs to be more mobile. Can’t get away with being as sluggish as he was at Colorado. Fat NFL guys run 4.6 now more than ever.   -Accurate, but lacks ball speed that really good defenses will jump on at the next level.  -Will get murdered because naturally drifts where the D-End shoots of the edge.  -Will probably end up fixing these things and being really good, but how many years from now?
Klatt sounds foolish and naive.
Used to have a lot of respect for Rich but he's gone full hack for Shedeur. Embarrassing.😂
Over 100 picks yet it’s all about one player! This is ridiculous
You got to love Rich eisen's flip-flopping nature. He says constantly that he deals in narratives and then goes to criticize every single one of the coaches in the NFL for not being able to control the narrative if they drafted Sanders.... The thing that you're trying to create?
Rich is ridiculously mald
Homie literally told shedeur to: "Pick up the phone and BEG!!!" LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
Joel is right, the person is maybe more important than the player when you are a QB in the NFL.
I thought for sure that he would go in the second round. I don’t think this is as political as people make it out to be, but the fact that he’s still there, who knows.   Daniel Jeremiah and his advice was borderline awful. That’s admitting something that I don’t even think is the issue. This has genuinely just turned ugly, honestly.
This is league wide collusion with aid from some in the media to put these Sanders boys in their place.  Your not bigger than the shield and we will put you in your place.
This is a bunch of white billionaire owners telling an already-rich and confident young black man to fall in line and do it their way. Utter BS, this has nothing to do with football. They did it to Lamar, who consistently proved everyone wrong, and Shedeur should do the same. Shame on the NFL.
Thank you Rich for standing by your guy.
And what up with these "anonymous" people talking stuff? When are we gonna call them out? Put your name on what words you say and stand on it. Travis Hunter went the same route as Shaduer, but somehow Sheduer is the iffy seed.....come on! I'm calling full cap on this!!
His terrible attitude, personality and lack of leadership are clear as day. This is a surprise to nobody but the "Prime" fanboys.
"Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall"  Proverbs 16:18
So he suppose to beg these people naw f all that
So he should call and begging
Shedeur has nobody to blame but himself. He handled this entire draft process horribly. He was acting like teams should feel privileged to interview him. Teams don't want that nonsense in the locker room. They also don't want his daddy always in their business and yapping on social media every time his son gets criticized or struggles. It's not rocket science.
Reports are saying he answered a FaceTime call while in the middle of an interview with an NFL coach and decided to stay on the FaceTime call for the entire interview
You're right Rich, other athletes have done much worst than somebody having too much "confidence". That's all they got? He's arrogant....really? So what about Aaron Rodgers when he got drafted? What about Manziel? Now yall want Sheduer to call the team and beg for a chance.....hell naw! If the tape don't show it, then what else you need to see?
32 teams can’t be wrong three straight times.
The Browns drafted a QB No. 1 caught on tape drunk and running from police.
This Legendary thing he’s marketing is spot on…This is crazy😮
Deep reflection. Are you serious 🧐
WHO DAT ⚜️
Joel, his attitude off the field is why he hasn't been selected.
Not that surprising, teams don't want the sideshow in their culture
Intriguing
Buck Breaking.
