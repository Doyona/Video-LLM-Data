Architect in a d war Mon ⚓️⚓️⚓️
Demarco you as a giant in the game can’t use a rookie artist as your punching bag to prove your point. You need to pick match with entertainer who are on the same level. The diss to fully bad; he is on the rise to stardom. Again, Demarco you even mention the bully pulpit, so you know what you are doing is wrong. Mavado and Kartel ( same caliber). If you don’t listen, Fully bad is already taken something away from you. Class, prestige, influence, status. Fun time over. Real war opponents you need. Fully bad handle you away to, but that a too
Demarco stop water down your thing. You already prove your point, but now you contribute to the rise of an upcoming artist Fully bad. Please come together and shake hands on screen with Fully bad so everyone knows that this is entertainment.

Me artist ..fully pad dead aready ....next object ...Namoni
Fully bad are you taking lessons 😂😂😂😂😂😂
🔥 🔥
lol😂😂😂😂 bun up!
This is it
All mi seh can is fullybad you did well and you are talented aswell but in this war so far Demarco got the win 🏆 for me.. this song from demarco is a classic war song that any sound man can play as a dub anywhere anytime.. this reminds me of mavado when he’s clashing vybz kartel I really love this one from demarco and I hope fullybad respects the legend Demarco in this dancehall era because he gave fullybad the recognition he was fighting for for a long time now no other artist never want to give fullybad this kind of highlight and Demarco came and gave it to him while still teaching/schooling him in musical clash. If I was fullybad I would accept my lost gracefully and respect Demarco for the rest of my life and use this highlight and find a big hit song so that everyone can know who is fullybad. That’s what I would do. Respect and love to you Demarco show dem other big artist ya how to give a young artist a real and proper strength

Fuckry diss
Number 1....
Kl a deadly me artist
Anyone who says this track is weak do not understand metaphors, figurative language and don't have the knowledge to recognize the craftiness in this track. You all are like kids that won't read a book without pictures. The man use the puppy tail flow, the old school flow and then the man use melody. I feel like a large portion of what went on in the track went over heads.  Fully bad did well in the war as well. Nothing to be ashamed about but demarco Schooled him like an elder should. I have always felt like demarco is underrated.
Demarco 😂born fi diss marco a lil tom tom dat ino 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Song weak 😢n7h bloodcllooth 😂😂
🔥
No this not ready I am not impressed one bad God Fully Bad. 😎🇯🇲
Ok So Fully Bad - Dogg Food vs Demarco Fully Pad : Fully Bad & Demarco song wss ok. I give Demarco the furst round cause he dud counter everything lyrically  - Fully Bad David v. Goliath vs Demarco Fully D3d : Demarco take this round easily with great melody & gruesome counteractions however i do believe Fully Bad's song had better overall Production  - Fully Bad Shemarco vs Demarco Child abuze : Personally think this is the weakest round so far yeah but Demarco's song was weak production, construction, & counteraction wise. Fully Bad's song was ok & i think he took this round. Fully Bad came with a new flow & had some decent counteractions, nit better than Fully D3d from the previous round though  - Fully Bad Albert vs Demarco Fully Funeral : Best Fully Bad somg in the clash so far. Production was good as always, flow was good, introduced a new things likevthe voicenote & what happen to Demarco, stuff that genuinely makes you laugh. Demarco's song was also very good. More lyrics than Fully Bad song with him counteracting everything, melody was 10/10 however my only nitpick with Demarco's song was that some of the counteractions in Fully Funeral were not as good Fully D3d. Fully Funeral had some great counteractions but also some that weren't that great. I say both Fully Bad & Demarco tied for this round, with maybe giving Fully Bad the edge cause some of Fully Vad's lyrics in Albert were genuinely funny but Demarco Fully Funeral have a lot of lyric
😂😂😂😂 bun up
Shemarco a u start up ur freaky chat ... move u bloodcllooth
