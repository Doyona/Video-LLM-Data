W for stream
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
29:48 It still amazes me how tourists don't already know these scams. Speed lost all his money without ever having the chance of winning in the first place and a French local fan even told him it was a scam. What they do is they first of all have a whole group around them acting like tourists playing the game and showing actual tourists that they could win but when the real tourists play the man hosting the game moves the cups around with one ball inside one of the cups but on his last movement he quickly takes the ball from under the cup into his palm so technically there's no ball in any of the cups so ur never going to win. That's why it's a scam, u were never gonna win in the first place
41:21 I recognize them from TikTok very controversial 😂😂😂

No boxing
I thought this would be a tour of Paris sights not football again
It’s funny, the only ones saying the stream was good are French Arabs. Amine could have showcased French culture and done a proper tourist-style stream like Speed did in China. But no, instead we got tacos and kebabs.
Yes we are life

WORST STREAM EVER.. FRANCE IS BORING..BORING BOOOORING
*Wasted stream. Paris is a shithole. I know I don't need to watch this according to the top comments I 100% expected*
The logic behind the tournament is actually ass, everybody should have the opportunity to equal the points out, after all these 3-2 situations are very unsatisfying
4:08:29 that point actually needs to go to the Chelsea guy who did defend successfully and the game ends 3-1 to Chelsea dude, but speed as he is always when he losses changes the rules to his benefits, speed didn't score one goal and yet he thinks he won. he is so arrogant that he actually thinks he can beat that guy at football, never will happen and at least he didn't take the money back because he knows he lost
WWWW
Paris
more like irl stream in Africa
this IRL SO BAD..... nothing interesting
You need to do research about your guides. Paris one of the most intersted city in the world and you play football 2 hours.

Go to France *Eat Mexican food* What next? Livestream Russia and want to eat Sushi?
34:29  he is 6 months whole
Honestly, that stream was a disgrace.  First of all, the Eiffel Tower fiasco shouldn’t have happened. You have a professional team and a French streamer to guide you, how did such a big detail went under the radar for you guys?  Secondly, French culture was NOT represented. At all. No monuments visited, nothing of cultural significance. NOTHING. Not even the food was French. You could’ve eaten in a proper institution if you wanted to really eat some French food. And if budget was really that big of an issue, you could’ve bought a sandwich, a patisserie and some water from a local bakery, made with fresh ingredients instead of that slop you consumed, and for the same price if not cheaper. Especially considering you had an indigestion right after eating that kebab.  Last but not least, the 1v1 tournament. Not gonna lie, that thing was disappointing for a livestream. I get this was an amateur tournament, but this should’ve been in a separate video.  All in all, this stream could’ve been so much more. But instead, it felt disorganized, and Amine was really not the best guy to guide you around Paris. As a Frenchman, I’m really disappointed. I think you’re better off hiring a proper guide next time.
🔥🔥🔥
Amine sale batard je me sub a ton twitch et tu lives jamais et d’un coup t la avec speed j’ai cru que t’étais mort

Mais nn le comeback😂
For all English speakers: What you saw is exactly the daily life and interests of a lot of suburbanites. These guys are only interested in football, boxing, gambling, kebabs, motors, streetwear, window shopping in shopping centers. This is the bum part of suburban culture. This is a truth in all the suburbs of France. I know what I'm saying, I grew up and lived in three suburban neighborhoods (Epinay-sur-Seine, Osny, Vigneux-sur-Seine) and have moved almost everywhere (Corbeil, Bobigny, La Courneuve, Limeil-Brevannes , Sarcelles, etc) it's the same everywhere.
You come back to the Philippines Rosario I live in the Philippines Rosario there. Come back now. I want to see you please. I have two cats. It’s a baby.

To whoever is reading this:  Bro… if no one’s told you lately: Jesus sees you. Like really sees you — in all your mess, pain, and confusion — and still says, “I love you. Come home.”❤❤❤  I used to chase everything trying to feel something — attention, parties, fake love, likes on a screen. But it never filled the emptiness.  Then I met Jesus. Not religion. Not rules. A real relationship with a God who died for me just so I could live free.  He doesn’t want perfect. He wants you, right now, as you are. Broken. Tired. Lost. He’ll carry you. Heal you. Change everything.  If you're reading this, it’s not by accident. He’s calling you.  Give Him a shot. One honest prayer. One moment. That’s all it takes. 💔➡️❤️‍🔥  #RealLove #JesusChangedMe #YoureNotTooFar ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jesus died for ur sins have
is this really France,, really really boring stream., you could have just stay in your room and do the stream
I swear it was so badddddd in france Paris please go to marseille but london was 1000times better
ISHOW SPEED, what Amine introduced you to is the France of delinquents, of poorly educated wech (a word that is not French) from the projects. THIS IS NOT FRANCE AND IS NOT FRENCH! This is not French gastronomy! Shame on Amine, this bad person who has nothing French about him!
ISHOW SPEED, ce qu'Amine t'a fait découvrir, c'est la France des délinquants, des wech (mot qui n'est pas français) de cité mal éduqués. CECI N'EST PAS LA FRANCE ET N'EST PAS FRANÇAIS ! Cela n'est pas la gastronomie française ! Honte à Amine, cette mauvaise personne qui n'a rien de français !
29:33 I am not even suprised that the nigga with scam history helped to promote another scammer in Paris, making his followers to think it's a legit game where you actually have a chance...
you know this is the worst stream because it doesn't even fit what speed's character is nothing's wild happening and that sport is just not for him it's just because of ronaldo
is not speed is paris the problem
Le frangin il a chaud de ouf 😂😂c’est pas ton frangin 😂🤣🤣

Je donne simplement une information : le porc est légal en Turquie depuis de nombreuses années et figure sur la liste des viandes de boucherie. Il existe 987 élevages porcins dans 18 provinces turques. J'ai entendu cela au journal télévisé national turc.
Bro don't taste the French tacos
After have seen the crazy shit you did in China.... I feel stupid about what you saw in France.... what a fuckin shame for us.
Mdrrr pk il y a ogeman ????

Wesh le chauffeur de speed il ne fait archi pas semblant 😂
There are 40,000 castles in France. It's one of the countries with the most diverse landscapes. Paris is one of the capitals of art, fashion, and cuisine. And you took him to a fucking taco shop.

This Is The Worst IRL Stream Ever In The World Of YouTube
Poland was much better
Voyager en France, c’est juste faire des activités de banlieusard, avec des banlieusards. Le mec n’a rien vu de français. Même bouffer, ce n’était pas français… Je ne sais pas, ce n’est pas difficile d’accepter que, même si tu es d’une autre origine que la France, si le mec que tu dois guider est venu pour voir la France, tu fais l’effort de lui montrer des trucs français, non ?  Il n’y a plus aucun influenceur qui vienne en France pour présenter son voyage et en ressorte satisfait ou content d’avoir voyagé en France. Tous ont des désillusions une fois arrivés. Et en 5 heures, les millions de vues que ça a fait ont également été déçus de ce pays. Pas étonnant quand on voit les "guides" de la France. Amine ne connaît rien à la France. Il y vit, oui, mais tu lui poses n’importe quelle question de culture générale sur la France, il ne sait rien. Alors il ne faut pas s’attendre à ce que notre beau pays soit mis en valeur par ce genre de personne.  Rien de méchant envers Amine, qui ne fait que ce qu’il sait faire. Il présente ce dans quoi il vit, ce dans quoi il est à l’aise. Eh bien, ce n’est pas la "culture française".  Bref, rien d’étonnant.  D’un certain côté, je suis content que, sur les réseaux, le monde entier se moque de la France et de ce qu’elle est devenue, car les Français ne veulent pas s’en rendre compte et nous traitent de racistes dès qu’on pense différemment.
Go to italy different gravy start at monte Blanco
French people have novices they got no vibes nearly as bad as the Swiss ,when ugoto italy diffetent feeling peoplelive and love food the best on the planet go to kont hlanc piemonte Speed trust me

29:22 you should have picked his right hand 😂🥇
Amine qui pensais faire visiter la France à ses cousins du blede mdr c une catastrophe
this was a rare L
Catastrophique
Go to the netherlands
Désolé que tu aie eu affaire à Amine que personne n’aime en France et qui n’a servi à rien à part t’emmener dans des endroits de merde avec de la vieille bouffe pour doberman  Les français s’excuse tu n’avais pas à te faire humilier comme ça
Il a eu c’est 10k ?😅 Normalement le repas street food c’était un jambon fromage beurre et un verre de vin faut pas avoir honte 😅
Just go back to Asia bro, EU is boring for IRL streams. Revisit Indonesia, South Korea, China, Japan etc.

I mean, Speed goes to three countries without any problems and literally Monaco is the worst, it surpassed them all as the worst, 4 times and 4 falls.
Stream is being weird. Low views, doesn’t send out notification & hella laggy. Hope he figures it out. That’s why streams keep getting removed

Speed is live another platform so😢
guys the stream is on twitch
I noticed that Henry’s a straight-up loser, man. Always acting like he’s hard when there’s barely a crowd—real tough guy vibes when no one’s watching. But as soon as he’s in France or Norway, he gets quiet real quick 🤣 Scared of the crowd, bro! And the funniest part? He only acts tough around 8-year-old kids. That’s some weak energy.
Stream deleted again💀💀💀
bros stream was laggin that hard? Hopefully it aint green apples for today

Welcome to PSG speed. It was nice having you at Manchester United and AC Milan. May you have the best time
I am French and Amine is known for promoting arab culture but not french culture. In France there is no nationalism or pride in promoting our country and our culture, otherwise we are called racists and Nazis. Speed should go to Spain or Italy, they will then see good people without identity problems.
newt time come to marseille Speed, paris is boring we are burning hot waitin for you and playing not boring football
BrocometoIndiainTamilNaduinRajapalayamPles❤❤❤❤❤ 💪🤜🤛

stream horrible  jsp qui a organisé ça honnêtement mais si c’est amine franchement tu nous a tous soulés  tu pars jsp combien de mois et tu reviens pour un gros stream pour au final aller au tacos, faire du foot, et se faire refuser de la tour effeil   déjà dans TOUS les pays il y a des quartiers des cités des endroits un peu pauvres avec des snacks et tout, mais tous les autres pays des streams ont montré leur CULTURE, là personne à kiffé sauf les bandeurs de cité   amine fou rien du streams, vous avez même pas pris la peine de demander l’autorisation de la tour effeil alors que tout le monde sait que pour la filmer il faut une autorisation   la France c’est tellement plus que des tacos et du foot, ça c’est la vision des cités d’île de france et franchement vous nous soûlez   rien qu’à paris y’a tellement de monuments, de lieu, de restaurants, là ça dégoûte   et puis tout ne tourne pas autour de paris hein, un stream en bretagne ou à lyon ou en alsace ou dans la côte d’azur ou dans les alpes ça aurait été incroyable mais non faut que comme d’habitude quelqu’un gâche tout, et si c’est amine tu nous déçoit tous
5:00:00

Hey speed am from india can you help me fund for education for my friend i can send you the university details.
There were so many things to do in Paris: - Climb the steps of the Sacré-Cœur  - Stroll along the Champs-Élysées - Take a cruise on the Seine - Go on the rides at Disneyland - Visit the Opéra Garnier, the Moulin Rouge, the Catacombs, Montmartre, the Palace of Versailles, the Louvre, the Pantheon... - Play boules along the Canal de l'Ourcq - Discover the local cuisine: beef bourguignon, snails, coq au vin, pastries... Please, if you come back to Paris, take a real tourist guide
L stream: L ballers, L un-healthy food, there’s so much more to eat in France, L Security for not allowing Speed to go to Eiffel Tower with Slipz and the camera. Really disappointed as a French.
Emily in kebab
Kebab, Foot, Ca c'est pas la culture Française, c'est la culture des chiottes
that guide's useless man 🤣
0:38 the moment Darren switches to iShowSpeed
SAD TO SAY THIS IS THE MOST BORING ONE HE HAS EVER DONE
It's not the France !
Frankistant
Türk varmı
that was boring TBH
I see nothing french in your stream bro
90% immigrants 1% french 95% culture was not french
L stream. Got scammed in the beginning, 90% dumbass football, end stream bc he needs to take a shit.
for everyone complaining about the stream, think about that if he would make normal stream in paris as he does in other cities the city would burn
Go to Iran?
Côme Madagascar
comment il a voulu gratter le tik tok le scamer
Speed Madagascar
Bruh France aint got no French ppl, its just immigrants who speak French. L stream
You're showing your true face now, Speed, you're nothing, buddy..
Who cares about this guy?  In 4 years everyone will forgot him and jump into the next dude . So disappointed by Amine who follow him like a dog
L
No natural views, no collab, no great food. Very disappointed stream fr.  L stream
welcome to arabic france
Boood😂😂😂😂
LAMINE YAMAL BALON DOR 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Come to Nigeria and stream with peller
The start of the steam an yall boys acting weird asf smh. Speed better then me he would have had to get these hands
This is what happen to a country largely wide open to immigration from Africa, muslim and black, French Republic made unfortunately France as a shit hole country.
W
Its not à culture of France but culture from africa and ghetto  "Amine"
Amine, you need to take a break… oh wait, you’re already on a break. Still four more months for a ‘mystery project’ that we’ll probably never hear about, because you chose to waste a 5-hour stream with Speed just to tell him ‘LeBron James = masturbate in France.’ Wake up — you’re 45 years old.
Messi first scorer now!!!!
L stream
U should try visiting Morocco next time
So he basically didnt visit France
Ils ont tirés speed le bas en France ! Dans un kebab, ils ont transformé le PSG en city, ils l’ont ramener faire des jeux illégaux avec des roumains ! Le guide youtubeur et la France ont rabaissé le niveau de speed ! Il est accueillie par des présidents dans d’autres pays à en Asie par des dynastie milliardaires et en France par des Ksos ambiance kebab quartier très réducteur !
France is just so boring🥱🥱
Amine t’as du sang sur les mains mdrrr t’as gaché son live
I've just discover this on news paper, so I come to have a look and…🥱How is it possible to make a so… empty and boring content… and people appreciate that kind of stuff? I'm really concerned about people then (for a long time indeed)
Yo speed race e if your not a pussy come to kuwait my address is mangaf block 4 street 26 building no. 161 come to floor 3 door 8 I am the fastest in the neighbourhood
Hey Speed, sorry to break it to you, but you didn’t visit France — you visited North Africa.
I really enjoyed the stream. Knowing that Speed came to France two years ago and found it boring back then makes this new visit way more special. This time there was real energy. Football, people, food — he even tried Le 129, a local fast food I eat at almost every day.  But I get why some of you were confused or disappointed. You expected to see “France”, like the one you imagine from the outside. Instead, you saw something totally different — a lot of immigration, a vibe that felt off to you. And honestly, you’re not wrong to be surprised.  I live here, I grew up in this environment. For me, this is normal. This is my France. But I realize now that it might look completely different from what people outside the country expect.  And I think the local guide played a big role. Maybe he didn’t want to show the “classic” France, maybe he just showed Speed his own version — based on his culture, his background. Which is fine, but it can be limiting.  It’s like if you’re Indian, born in France, and when someone visits, you only show them your Indian side instead of the country you live in. It creates a weird gap.  So yeah, I understand the frustration. Expectations weren’t the same. But from my side, it felt real, it felt alive.
Bro no one wanna watch u play football Show the city and the culture 🤦‍♂️
That 1v1 shit is boring stop doing that
Paris WAS good. Now, everybody praise this street culture (tv, medias, all politics except "far right"). And so yes, we can see what is this new culture in this stream : not organized at all, scammed by romanians, eiffel tower with over-security, shitty street food that makes his stomach hurts, this is the new France, and it is illegal to say that it's bad
really bad stream
Dude please in livestream in brunei i'm in brunei too
even if you did just walk around streets, talk with locals it could be much better
i,ll be your africa tour guide bruu
ngl i thought i was the problem because i felt like this stream was not it, but came to the comments and saw other people thought the same also. Not in a mean or bad way but i expected more from this stream
World Cup football❤
It's country is so not interesting live we can films all the monuments in Europe and in China except in France too many people closed in mind
1 vs 1 deffo killed the vibes
Unfortunately you have come in France with the most retarded french streamer that did not plan anything. Amine is a low IQ uncultivated guy...

The person with you is very rude and worst stream and stop doing food vlog because you are wasting in every stream.i know you are doing stream just for twitch contract but bad organisers bad streams just running for money ..literally a waste of time whoever watching
The Stream was ended at 3AM if it is was in France, It should have been seen at night, this is a little weird
Ishowspeed you should race thyreek hill please i no you are gonna win
PSG and eating "arabic tacos".  Nothing french.
Go in africa pls to congo 🇨🇬
Bro no freaking way speed was in Paris at the same time as me and I didn’t see him at all 😔
Tacos^
Football pitch is soo boring because majority of them are not from france they just from UK .. Stream too bored... There so much thing to do instead of watching playing football..travel for this??
3:50 fact
Eating tacos
french are rude af deadass
Porażka w tej śmiesznej francji.
What long jing😅
A white country without almost white people... Crazy
The best city in the world just to watch spme one iq stupid invaders play is crazy re do it better...
Where was the French cultural? The majority of the countries you visited represented their culture
This stream is a disaster. Amine does nothing to showcase French culture — five hours of mediocre subculture.
The most beautiful and best country and city in the world and the worst live...
Bro first time i gotta say this but L country L stream, we didnt even see the country properly just the iffle tower and some nachos, Hopefully spain is next
Come to kuwait is safe
I can officially tell "This is the most boring livestream speed ever done"
L Stream, there’s so much to do in Paris. It would’ve been actual chaos if he went around the city, but he wasted it on the stupid football tournament.
Speed in Québec quand
Go to Russia please
Places that dont allow cameras are such L's, but they literally allow phone cameras like what kinda dumbass rules are these smh.

You have to be a special kind of stupid to fuck up a Paris stream this badly. Literally just pick 3-5 cultural spots and 1 local cuisine that's ACTUALLY French. Wtf were they thinking? Fire your entire team.

Normally the streams are a W but only 45mins in Paris come on there was so much to see next time (if there is a next time) plan it better or get a better guide.🇫🇷🥐🧀🐭🐓
Encore que des enfants le suivent et cris son nom je veux bien mais putain les neuilles ultime qui le suivent passe devant crient pour avoir une photo où un moment de gloire a la caméra sont des moments particulièrement gênant a voir. Par exemple le mec a la banane qui essaie expressément de prendre une photo avec lui ou le gars qui dit Hitler. Extrêmement gênant
quelle mauvaise foie du gagnant quand il a perdu contre Speed, sur la dernière action il savait très bien qu'elle était décisive - il serait parti en courant s'il l'avait marquée alors qu'il n'aurait pas "marquer 3 buts" comme c'est soit disant la règle qu'il a annoncée - mais bon GG on aurait tous tenté ce retournement au vu des 5K en jeu mais lui même sait qu'il a perdu dans les règles
No more Europe tour this is the last i guess sad
Wtf france
Motorlu çocuğun alttaki ışıkları yanıyor ya burda olsa polis eksra taktın diye sker atardi motoru bu ülkede polis ceza yazmak için var zengine usulsüzlük yaparsa anca izlerler garibana gücü yetiyor tayibin askerleri

Alala il m'a encore gaché un contenu

Doesn’t he go to Paris every year for the Ballon d’or?
Bro speed gotta do some of his own research on the culture of the country he’s going to or do a poll with people who live in that country and then plan his visit himself, some of these guides are Ls bro
After Poland irl everything is boring
❤
I know your name it is. See
Amine is a good guy but this was a mistake. He doesn't know french culture. We have the best food in the world.. and sooo much things to do & see. Hope u'll come back my bro. & plzzz stop sayin "wesh" its disgusting.

Le live en France a du potentiel mais les activité d’Amine sont moyenne voir nul c’est serai mieux si c’est serai Michou ou inoxtag qui le ferai visiter eux ils ont plus de contact et ils sont moin nonchalant qu’Amine ils animeraient encore plus le live inoxtag a peur de dire les choses par contre Michou est des fois réserver mais si il se lache il peut être drôle et faire du bon contenu pr les ricains

Worst stream ever
Ayo when speed playin red dead 1?
If you compare this live stream to many others Speed has done, this one is not on the same level. Not even close, unfortunately. Some other streams have been super well planned and organised, but this one just felt disorganised. Oh well, next time!
To be honest .. this stream was “L”
Hey bruva I just missed you today in freelance.im.from the UK. A team of riders rode their bike from London to Paris check it out it's called Cycle for Humanity and you even spoke to one of out little supporters and you was dancing to his drum Big respect keep uo the good work

Speed please do a part 2 in France 🇫🇷! But do it properly
Who’s watching this in 2025
i’m in paris rn
As a French viewer who’s followed all your streams, I just want to share my honest thoughts. I was really disappointed by the France stream...I knew it would take place in Paris rather than elsewhere in the country, but even knowing that, I expected something more impactful. Paris is one of the most iconic and historically cities in the world, and yet what people will mostly remember from this stream is one football stadium and mid football amateurs... Even the food was not iconic. Maybe I had high expectations, but it felt like the stream didn’t even scratch the surface of what Paris has to offer  I really hope Speed gets the chance to discover more of France in the future. The country is incredibly diverse. Each region has its own culture, food, traditions, and mindset. Because of its geography and long history, traveling from one city to another can feel like visiting a completely different country. A tour of France could bring a unique experience every single day and help people realize that France is much more than just Paris and parisians. There are passionate and welcoming french streamers / personalities in many regions who would be excited to help plan something amazing for you and your team and introduce their local culture. I truly hope that one day we will see streams from different parts of France that show what the country is really about.  PS : Amine jte kiff, je sais pas quel est ton pouvoir sur le programme, mais ce qui a été fait était largement en dessous du potentiel que Speed pouvait découvrir de Paname. La partie au parc c'était pas mal mais ça va pas plus loin pour moi. Dommage
Discover France : meet French Arabic…. Hahahaha
I mean smooveDre

I love speed stream but come on these particular streams was trash 😂😂😂 Firstly, France is bigger than just Paris ,you should have tried other French region. Moreover, streaming the football tournament was so dumb and boring. I usually watch all your streams videos especially tour videos but these particular one am skipping, please do better.💯🙏🏾

The worst stream

Thought speed was gonna owe us back for what happend to slovekia and now watching the paris stream this is embarassing than bosnia
Speed has a good team and good security They have memorised everything they need to do and I noticed they cater to him perfect W to speed team
L stream do another one
the guide behaved bad, telling speed not to jump when he was excited, leaking the next location, and telling speed Messi was better
The two gentlemen who are Speed's security guards are absolutely amazing. He Is very lucky to have them. W both of them ❤
Speed really be wearing Jean shorts? Ohio in the blood!🤠😅😂
boring stream ever
France aint france no more DEPORT make EU great again
This is the problem with some of these guides. They take Speed to shit they know he's into (like soccer, and fast food) but its been overdone hence the boring stream comments. Take him to something new and completely out of pocket, thats what draws viewers.
When he finally comes in France i am not here ;-;
The best part was scammers 😅😂.  Guy was funny... what a skill.. I couldn't even see him pick up the ball then place it back in the cup.. so fast, even speed couldn't see it.. scammer let him see it to create more hope 😅😂
hey I was in that boat 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 I saw

Can’t wait till you finish your “world tour” streams in places you’ve already traveled to so that you actually have to make content again. Maybe you’ll learn that you don’t have to cater to the third world country inbred 10 year olds anymore
Speed tired I guess cause last two streams were so so, low engagement and poor travel program
Speeeeed go on date

People gotta stop saying L tour guides. Yeah they suck but it’s speed and his team that are choosing them. Stop being fuckin lazy and find a good mannered, professional tour guide like the ones you had in China. Y’all are just finding retards off the streets and asking them to tour you is what it seems like.
The worst of france, great

Could you focus on: 5% football content 95% streaming the authentic culture of the city you're visiting—that was a genuinely an L stream! The 1v1 $10K prize competition should’ve been a separate stream. Next time, Speed, please! 🙌🏽🍏
0% France  100% Magreb...
Speed it’s my birthday ! Thank you for the stream !!!! 🎉
L STREAM . Speed’s Paris stream was honestly a mess. Zero preparation — he visits an empty Parc des Princes (great atmosphere...), and lets the 1v1 tournament be organized by the UK guys… while he’s literally in France. Then he complains about the level of play? He didn’t even check the filming rules at the Eiffel Tower. Seriously? He had so many chances to create great content here, but ended up doing everything last-minute and sloppy. Big disappointment.
MY FRIEBDS SAW GOU THERE THEY WERE THERE
I'm French and watched every Speed stream, but that one is the worst Speed stream so far
Bonjour show speed
Speed you are slow
I’m faster than speed
Is the tour guide retarded? 😂
To be honest, the winner did say first one to score 3 but the translator is either bad or standing in speeds side.
29:20 ! Look at his hand... He takes the ball in his hand and then puts it down while picking it up. FRAUD!!
Come to The Netherlands! It’s great here 😊
you had fkin Eiffel Tower with a 360 view from top, and your logistics team failed to secure a permit even. Wasted time on fkin bullshit kids, psg and taco's.  That guide has no idea what high end France is like.
No wonder that's Amine haven't streamed since months, he has lost all his aura, he's so boring now. Such a L stream.
*Speed is so bitty and disgusting he agrees on first to score 3 goals then he change it seriously pathetic*
unfortunately only garbage immigrant cultures and romanian gypsie stream
im not french, you'd need months to fit all the culture and gastronomy from France. and you do useless 1v1, and algerian taco's. Nice.
Speed, I would like to see these kind of streams from different cities in USA from you
How are you that stupid when the entire chat just told you its a scam? 30:40 whats the point of even looking at the chat if you can't even read, that scam has been going on for ages, either your acting stupid or just letting yourself get clip farm because i can assure you those scammers are going to be sharing and using the vid they took of you to scam more people. congrats
Sometimes you don't eat murder in a stream ?
Ogeman sur la minia sa fait peur
Bruh he did not do nothing special😮
Amine is a shit and doesn't represent my country at all
dude you have the most amazing fine dining and anything you can do there, and you fail every stream in France and italy.
sweating during eating and he also drinks a lot of water, most likely diabetes
L stream
Bosnia and France ,,💩💩
W FOR SLIPZ❤❤
I'm going to be direct and honest: it was as bad as Bosnia. You didn't see anything of France or Paris and its region, the real local cuisine and its diversity . Next time, let me know! I was born and raised in Paris. I know the major regions well—there's so much to discover. I have ideas to multiply your view count from today by 10. We won’t surpass China, but at least we’ll get a bit closer to Turkey 😆.   I’m waiting to see a stream in Russia, Iran, Angola, Botswana, Nigeria (you’ll need to prepare well 😏)

A country without culture (long forgotten), shit on the streets, the mentality of African poverty. Once it was a country of inspiration, now it's a pile of shit.
Ce mec là "Speed" a un melon énoooorme.  Y'a tellement mieux à faire en France.  (Je suis français), et tu aurais dû aller au Louvres, t'intéresser à la culture française, la cuisine par exemple (la vraie). Comprendre/savoir notre histoire. Bref, cette vidéos est totalement ridicule que j'en suis au point de non retour.

Ronaldo didnt play striker his entire career? The entire fanbase claims he played as a midfielder during his time at United before he left for Madrid. And he only had 22 assists in 129 games.

I aint complaining but improve the next france stream,This stream didn't have any colour to it. This is like you visited an off copy Middle Eastern African country from temu. The football part killed the stream you should, next time try France History and culture maybe go to a french village and explore true france dont always stick to the big cities there are beautiful architecture and landscape in france even from the emprie days
All I see is immigrants where the french people even all the football are immigrants lol....
People on paris are cringe asf wtf. Look at the face off speed he is no happy to be here and I understand

ngl this was the most boring irl stream of all, france is a great place he could have done better things than doing an boring soccer tournament.
Ts was so boring😭
French people are the worst and boring. This stream was the proof
I’m french and I’m ashamed of this guide… the worst possible image of France he could give 🤮
That was irl stream in Paris. When irl stream in France?
Ya
Go to the eiffel tower go to louvre. You gotta redo, Paris.I hope this is not the only live stream Out There.Because you're really messing it up if you leave without doing all the cultural and tourist things. I've been the paris you gotta do somethings that are cultural. People were disappointed with this one. You can tell by the comment section. I hope speed sees this and changes up.
The way you motivated the little kid to go off the zip line was greatness! ❤
He saw nothing of French culture, and he even got scammed. Good job, France.

Jesus gave everything so you could know real peace and freedom and saving you from eternal damnation. He’s inviting you to come to Him before its too late. Don't neglect this, your tomorrow isn't promised. I’ve experienced Him, and it’s changed my life and I hope you’ll find Him too, all you need is a sincere heart and a bible, hope to see you in Heaven.

Speed il y a mieux à voir et à manger en France. Essaye d’être bien entouré quand tu viens ici ça t’évitera de finir à saint Denis avec des mecs qui n’ont que faire de la France et de la culture français.  Ce que tu as fais aujourd’hui ne représente en rien la France
Lil bro needs to do France part 2 and do it properly. L livestream

Boring
He should went to paris hoods that would be so LIT.
French people in this stream amounted to maybe 10% at best.
Speed streams in a different country every day and yall are always finding was to complain. Not every day is going to be the best day. Some streams are better than others and that’s expected when doing it daily.
Aga il était chez moi oklm, il est tombé love du chicken rouge ce Speed !

You saw nothing from french culture and im french
L Guide
Bro this got slightly boring compared to other streams. But I love you always.

"Mr Hype" Kuro Cameo
No french culture, food, architecture. Basically not a single French person in the whole stream.
Slipz lookalike asencio
Is this France or North Africa ?
Why speed was denied to tower?
thos bal scammers take the bal in the hand so there is no ball in all 3

speeds team really letting audiences down with these terrible choices of host/guides. either pick native social media stars who have a brain and know english or hire a genuine interpretor who can just shadow when you need their assistance.

Too much chaos and screaming most of the stream it's not enjoyable. I like Marlon's better. And he's so handsome 🥰
He just played football for 4 hours, you can do it in any country, also the guide was so useless.
Amine c’est pas le bon choix pour un guide, il aurait du prendre une personne plus calé . Ça serait vrmt décevant si c’est le dernier live  en France .
Speed j'aime vraiment tes gardes du corps ils sont vraiment au petit soin avec toi et ils sont calmes et pro
If you waste things like this.  Waste it on me then. $ahmedk1281

Keep traveling only to western big cities which are 90% violent immigrants brought here by Israel.
I'm looking forward beautiful places in France that they proud of but, it's boring to watch mostly is football ⚽ I do like the sport but, this is not expected to be too much long compared to your other tours. 😢
This was a sick livestream. I am so happy to see you enjoy yourself and seeing the world. Truly amazing experiences for someone so young as yourself. I love to see you happy.
What a boring livestream, Poland wins i think no matter where you go

For me football doesn't suit for Speed he's more like a hooper type of guy
0 stream football for kids 2900
COME TO BELGIUM NEXT
You could have done better Speed instead of spending 80% watching boring football, Paris is a very diverse city and had the highest potential to be the best stream. There was much more to do whether it was in terms of French cuisine, architecture and even fashion. Even Marlon did a better stream in Paris.
Boring France stream
France has an exceptionally rich and varied cultural heritage, but why do we see amateur football and no French food
Bro is a liar he said he will go to Eastern Europe like Ukraine Russia Belarus Moldova also countries like Lichtenstein Monaco Vatican City he hasn’t visited any of them. Instead he goes around and visits countries that he has already been to like wtf bro all of the countries that I mentioned are absolutely beautiful in there own way why not visit them (Like this Comment so that Speeds notices it). !!!!!! 😢
****THIS STREAM SUCKED.....WTF???????****
5 hours of shit... seriously!! The world has  fallen
ебать не одного толком Француза нет -лишь парочку видел -страну тупо подарили мигрантам
Nobody cares about football every stream they have to bring him to x stadium and give him a football shirt with his name wow, so original, i love watching the same thing over and over in every country no do the same in every country you visit in Africa peak content............
Hi IshowSpeed. Please can you read the new educational book called 'The Replacement People of the Bible', and see what the rabbis and priests have been hiding for thousands of years about Prophet Muhammad being prophesied in the Old Testament. Also, how the Muslims got the West out of the Dark Ages, which the Western educational institutions are hiding from people.
He sounds  like a pain in the butt
Was waiting for france because it can get crazy but ofc speed does a shitty tournament
Wesh amine nous a vendu comment ça révèle le secret de Lebron James
Speed stop having tour guides who don’t really want to guide you and have an attitude the entire stream they rlly be hating.
1:10:24😂😂
Football is the only thing left in France.
This city wasn't giving
44:00 Lonchin lonchin in France 😆
France is Trash they scam him and they didn't even allow you to enter tower with camera  L France
5:00:33 funniest part of the stream
Boring football tournament
Ogeman
This broadcast was really ridiculous, the French guide did not manage it well at all. It was a very empty broadcast. The best broadcast was Türkiye. That broadcast was great. The best is Türkiye.
IShowSpeed would fit perfectly in a women's football team, he has quite a high sissy factor.
speed plsss next you come Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
4:05:26 😭😭😭speed got destroyed
Ishowspeed come to kosovo
Save France
Why this stream we don't see a lot of France cultures like another country IRL?
The winner with the Chelsea shirt needs to spend all that 10k on English and French lessons because even his French isn't good.
speed... why... you come to france only for playing football...    this is not irl stream in france then...
Bro is chilling with ingenieurs and doctors 😂
Chelsea destroyed PSG 3-0 now a Chelsea fan won at the tournament 😂
Jsuis entrain de vriller jamais de la vie j’aurais cru voir Speed au 129 avec Aminmatue jsuis dégouté si j’avais su je serai venu vu que c’est juste à côté de chez moi

Слабенько.  Хуита.

Chat are we live
Mdr je m'attendais pas a voir amine 😆
La honte ptn. En Chine ils lui font faire du drone volant et en France on l’emmène faire du foot avec ogeman la honte les gars !!
Pick smaller cities next time. Capital cities in left wing liberal countries 99% refugees.  Quite tired of screamin arabs and MENA. who forcing them selfs to the frontline you cant even talk to real french ppl like beeing in same city all the time
Yo
leave this place🤮🤮🤮 FCKIN BORRING FRANCE. Come back to Poland 🇵🇱 This Day was shit 🤮
Cant believe @IShowSpeed fell for the street scam with the cup&ball. Everyone knows that it's a scam. His Chat told him 10mins before he did it. Speed makes me laugh, 99% of the time he's not paying any attention to whats going on around him hence why HENRY & HERCLES are good for him as they help him out loads. Without them he'd be even more lost in my opinion.
Speed pls do stream france again.. L stream sorry speed
for people complaining about him not going to fancy places etc… he touched those who live normal lives there
Boring stream
French despise Black people even more than the Amerikkkans, but they wont show you in your face most of the time, but if you have a lot of money, they may look at you differently, Good look Bro 😁
Bro. I destroyed the Eiffel Tower. Like what??
Honestly this is so Boring
Crazy lie bro
As a French, I feel ashamed…
France L
What is this lousy welcome? This is not France
Worst speed stream ever 😢

28:55 what a scam, look at him hand, he takes this ball to hand, u can see it in slowmo
Im french  France is overrated
Such a boring stream spent over 2 hours watching people kick a ball about on a field instead of travelling around the country and experiencing what france has to offer L STREAM
L stream
I only watch for Rudiger and Henry at this point. Speed really let fame go to his head most of the times.
The best way to get the chance to win the best friend is a great day of the year old are going through some of my life is a great
I worsted my time..
most boring stream ever
❤️💯
Worst steam by far from all countries... boring af
Speed help me i need money

Speed we need to race
Worst stream ever speed tbh 💔🥺
My chocolate angel🖤, you make my heart melt😘👀
He should go to marseille i feel like the energy would be better
Even Slovakia was better than this
What are yall expecting from a young goofy adult child in speed😂😂
I never seen Speed this grumpy on live stream....
L country L stream
Today's stream was completely boring. Even yesterday in Slovakia was more interesting.
Proof that France can turn anything unwatchable
L speed boring stream
Ngl the baller idea is fucking big L..
9:15 funniest question of the stream
You go to France and you enjoy only foreign immigrants shits, go F yourself man
speeds only idea is how much money i can pump out from these streams and put ads in.
L stream today 😢 boring 🥱
W scene where Speed motivates the crying boy at the PSG stadium during the "Zippin' Paris" zip line was truly special! His encouragement not only brought an instant smile but also built the boy's confidence in that moment. It’s amazing how a few kind words can change everything!
He scamed the shit out of him lmao 29:00
Its aminematue who organised this he is big L for taking him for sunday football he shouldve choose a better host
speed that football 1v1 that ain't it my guy - this is not basketball - you don't really do 1v1 on football and its not that interesting of a content especially when in a beautiful big city like Paris where there are so many entertaining activities for good content and so many stunning sights... I think the 1v1 kinda ruins the whole vibe - the only countries probably where it will be very entertaining is Brazil in the futsal arenas in the  favelas and then in central and northern Africa where people are dirt poor and really need the money so they gonna give it their all...  Not a very good stream that one - do your thing and interact with locals that's what we want to see... All love tho✌️
That Guide has a L 😭
Stop getting these non chalant guides with no energy man they suck the life out of the stream. Dude complained when u jumped over a trash can 4:00 Need someone in each country that matches yours
This was boring
L stream
Really bad stream,bad guide, bad content! Could do so much more
Love France since young hope to visit this beautiful country one day
he was boreed
Big fan, bro😢
Should have done Ireland instead man
He got his mouth punched up bro W FOR SPEED !!!  AMAZING DEFENCE GREAT ATTACK
I EXPECTED THE FRANCE STREAM TO BE MORE FIRE BRO🥲🥲BIG RESPECT FOR SPEED FOR NOT TAKING THE BOY`S MONEY👊👊
Go to Palestine and help them and make them happy please chat tell ishowspeed to go to Palestine💖💖💖💖💖
Banana

Mdr i a  personne qui a compris quelle que chose dans le 129 😂😂😂
L tour guide again. Where you get these guys from man? He really took you to the scammer Romanis and was standing there acting impressed 🫣. There are tons of videos on those Romani scammers.
Didnt feel like irl stream so part 2?
There is so much to do in Paris and Speed did nothing really 🤦‍♂️ Like why ?
Next go to Palestine 💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
Gas problem 😢
After Serbia, this is the worst stream!!!!
Who miss china unc
is it time for ishowspeed downfall?
PLEASE GO TO CANADA I SUBBED❤❤❤
DO ANOTHER STREAM IN FRANCE... that was MISSING FRANCE !
France might be the worst country I've ever seen. I don't understand how people live here. There's only the Eiffel Tower and everyone brags about not knowing English :)) okeyy. French people, I'm calling on you, please stay there and don't go to another country. It's hard enough without you.
Ishowboring

weakest day of the week tbh

I think this was the worst stream few viewers and little interaction with the public and much time wasted cmq you love the same speed
Yeah Speed Dopest Gay Bro!
Bro really just came in front of my house
That's it????? Just football and fast food sandwich. And he 🍏 at only 5pm 💀💀
I was expecting to see Paris not some run of the mill soccer field pickup game you can see anywhere such as in Wichita Kansas.
You haven't discovered the real France, all you've seen is just football and food.
Lebron James face expression 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The thumbnail says it all
He’s not going back live
Loved this stream. Something different.
4:05:30 only time speed lost aura 😭😭😭😭
Bro if the next stream in Italy then go to Cinque Terre... It's this best place to visit and the vibe is crazy
As a French person, I knew that doing a stream in Paris would be bad. Come to France and eat a taco WTF... welcome to new france xD ahahah
W
Football part booooring
Spam w
43:18 monkey song 35:00 draw kid 1:09:00 kid coming
W
4:05:25 destroyed in ass
So bored all he did was was just go to Paris in see the top of the tower and play-f**kin* football moth***f**k*ing bi****
Worst stream this tour. 1v1 tourny was horrible to watch, and it's not because the players were bad. No decent rules, barely any space when the ball got passed back to the attacker and so many people were in the way the whole time.  Eifeltower security being little beaches.
4:58:13 lol
Fkkk where is french people , there is only Muslims and Algerian around uu  Francee fucked up
I thought he was in France not Algeria?
As a French person, I don't accept racism. When I saw certain chats during the live broadcast, it disappointed me to see childish behavior. However, I can understand that the live broadcast was boring, except for the Parc des Princes. Otherwise, the football tournament was really scary. We really appreciate the Amine guide. If we had to do a vlog in France in Paris, I would have left football aside. It's a shame at the beginning that the security rejected you for the Eiffel Tower, but I would have liked it to show us monuments in Paris or even certain well-known cities, whether in the north or the south. Department 93 is not the best department. For my part, thank you to the people who respected our country, even I am disappointed.
4:37:20 Speed so polite, even if he is hangry he wont take family dads food 💞
Was really waiting for a Bungee from the Eiffel Tower 😂❤
Poor preparation, why did we watch football for half the stream?
I waited for this stream because I wanted to see if it would be good since it's France, but no. I expected it to be a good stream because Paris is beautiful, so France is , but nah, I expected French people, but there were ZERO French people. Maybe speed should've went to other places in France maybe at least that'd work.
Speed you are the best YouTuber keep it up
sad i skipped this football shit ... sad I wanted to see france
I thought the black man was still alive
Speed went to France just to watch some boring amateur football and to eat an unknown food I'm sorry but this is probably his worst stream ngl
feed henry rudi

DEAD IN THE END FOOD
Summary: the HEART OF FRANCE, 'OVERLOOKED' (= something in France in the livestream is missing). From Eiffel Tower, Esplanade Joseph-Wresinski, Palais de Chaillot, Place du Trocadéro, Parc des Princes, to JUST the most BORING things in Saint-Denis with the football showdown thing? I expected a better discovery of Paris city centre, the gastronomic experience Speed could've had, as opposed to this boring showdown.  I'm super disappointed in the guide Amine, the guide who should've toured Paris and its historical sites with Speed. The guide didn't even think before speaking; he revealed a name of a location (when they were in front of Place du Trocadéro, en route to Parc des Princes). Speed could've had a massive crowd trying to approach him for pictures like what he experienced in Sarajevo for instance, if the guide had revealed a public location by mistake. Thank goodness Parc des Princes is a huge 50k stadium.  FOOD! People in the chat were trying to convince him to try fastfood. For real?  Also! The guide even promoted 'Algerian' food to Speed (since Amine himself is a French-Algerian) before Speed even get to try French traditional food, while the stream should've been focused on those authentic food namely Steak-frites, Beef bourguignon. Even delectable desserts such as the colourful Macarons, Crème Brûlée, and many more? Quite misleading especially it doesn't represent France as a whole nation. One of the contributors of this boring stream.  L GUIDE. L stream.  W Speed! + W Slipz for capturing the best side of the Parc des Princes stadium in the 2nd quarter of the live stream!
