Her hairline competing with baldy
only leaking the obese women is WILD AF
Don't worry life fucks me every day don't need a woman for anything
4chan is sometimes the internets savior
How did the ugly and mentally ill people come into power? That's some heavy hitting Dem media control and propaganda. They can twist weaker minds.
What amazes me is that she said they didn't have enough security. The app could have been made just to get all of their IDs. What better way to dox everyone?  You get one group of people to hunt down the info on the other group and for "security" reasons, you gotta give up your info. Then later after all that info is sold, oops, security breach. If it's still up next year, there's going to be another "security" breach or possibly they'll change the name and UI color
wait...these women were getting dates? Even the one with more piercings than a primitive tribe member? Are we sure these women weren't just trashing men on the app who refused to even give them the time of day?
o:15 those bangs holy shit lmfaaaaaoo
so many nose rings... really gets that noggin joggin
Self-awareness is hard for leftists.
Why do they always have the same haircut, same glasses, same piercings? It's like a starter kit.
Who is even dating those "women"? Some men really have to check themselves and their standards!
The irony here is comic gold!
That is NOT a woman.  Sorry.
Men already have an app like that for letting other men know who not to date. It's called a mouth. Also, women who stretch out the last syllable of words like she did aren't worth the trouble. You knoooow?
Let's be generous in the creation of a new dating app.  All users must be 30 or less on the BMI.
Man, some people really look like you hit randomize on a character creator
Wow, I’ve never seen so many ugly women😱
These women also have those weird eyebrows you only see with certain kinds of people.
When she said incels, I thought she was talking about herself.
Im sure glad the nose rings and haircuts tell me exactly who not to fuq with.
Ahhh, what's the matter.. Sweetheart.. Not Your Cup of Tea? 😑😶😐😕🙂😁😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😅😅😅😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭 ..oh .. no ...  Heart attack.                      ☠️
Why is Lord Farquad mad at Asmongold?
"we can't have fun on the internet, because my idea of fun is doing things to people that I hate having done to me"
Nicest way to put it…. Those ladies are ugly. 0/10. Nice hair though 💀💀
Is that the Homely Chick app?
Those bangs should be illegal and anyone with them, as well as their hairdresser, should be heavily fined.
Are shemales and trannies welcomed as women on your platform ?
Imagine being an internet user and still thinking that any info put on the internet is in any way actually 'secure'. Arrogant ignorance is its own form of disinfectant.
Hi. The issue at hand is no doubt important. But can we talk about the haircut???
The narration, the accent, the "...from 4Chan's intelligentsia..." choice of words...priceless! 😄
if she has bangs that are one inch. do not engage. i repeat. do NOT engage.
ROFLMAO!!! Age: 34. Height: 5'06". Weight: 347 lbs. Interests: Looking for new cats.
FUCKING WOMEN
'Somebody nasty was able to easily access' Bro.. it was a PUBLIC s3 bucket. Literally anyone could have accessed it.
My 3 year old just pointed at the screen and called her "Nose Monster". I've never been more proud 😂
Thank you 4chan 👍👌
1:28 Judging by the looks, interacting with this specimen is anything but secure. 🤣 Seriously, WHY do so many individuals today DESIRE to make themselves look like freaks? Is there a mental illness epidemic going on, worldwide? 🤦‍♂
What goes around come around. They wanted to to ake up alll mens space. Then create an app to dox men. Then they got doxxed and they are mad.
Sorry.  You leak and dox men. You will reap what you sow. LOL
lol hot girls have a place too.. I don’t know why the internet feels like they’ve cracked the code, because this is just the tip of the iceberg.. as a guy with access to the other sites, I know
If you’re and in cell  whatever that means   What are unable women who spend all their time on the Internet called because literally social media is dominated by women   ?   They love to come up with nicknames for everybody else. What about themselves?   Unda’s that’s what I’m going with “unda’s meaning un datable “
This is delicious. Feminazis reaping what chaos they sowed.   I am shocked that any of those hateful screachers was able to obtain a date with a biological male human.
yep, lots of nasty people were able to access these data... lots of weirdos
Why do these scumbag females always go for the Lloyd Christmas, Insectopod, smarmy f*ckface look?
The tea app carries alot of weight!
Funny they get an app to bully men, to slander men, to destroy mens lives and its ok but if i upload revenge porn its the worst crime ever.... 2 teir rights!
Feminists and their handicapped fringes (bangs)
You can almost assure yourself of the security of data which you have on your person in a quiescent state. Almost. You absolutely cannot make any assurances about data you've uploaded to an internet-connected system. No matter who says it is secure an impregnable, there'll always be a Bronn, Lord of Highgarden for cloud data.
99.99% of men are hackers, and these women should have known better.
Tea app + Believe all women What could possibly go wrong?
How dare you dox me when I am doxing other people!!!!!
How could anyone even consider dating them..... so ugly.... I would be ashamed to be seen without one of them.... even drunk AF....
Another reason why enabling GPS on your phone is an awful idea
these 4chan guys could take over a country if they put their mind to it
I never saw dumbest people, now I see them, in comment section...
Who would have thought that the majority of them would be 300lbs trolls.
The only thing that would make this whole thing better is if the app was named "Karma"
This might be a hot take, but I think there should be an app that has information shared about people that cheat. Think it will go viral like this one but fair and equal having both men and women in it. 😂
The unfuckables
F to the males that used their female family member's IDs to get access to this 😂
F 5'3 190lb
1:23 BINGO.
Ho ly cr ap... !! 😂 ALL of them are beyond fugly. 40 lbs and a flannel shirt 😂
What about the trans and they them pronoun people how are they ever gonna fit in now?
How is the app even legal to begin with? Can us guys also make a similar app?
Those bangs should be a crime.
Start nothin, there won't be nothin'
0:03 should've been the Tea Spill
So this tea app is all about saving the whales?
Mindset, im unattractive as fuck so lets make myself even more unattractive with the worst glasses, haircut and attitude 😂
Justice is never absent, only delayed
В начале ролика идёт фраза "Эй, инцелы снова взялись за своё", и глядя на аудиторию TeaApp, возникает убеждение, что как раз эта аудитория и есть инцелы. Реально, они совершенно не привлекательные - пирсинг, татуировки, проколотые носы, общая неопрятность. В них бурлит злоба, которую они зеркалят на мужчин. Это и есть понятие - инцел.
It was literally on a public server. There isn’t any hack or leak or whatever they literally willingly gave their info publicly
😂😂😂😂😂😂
ah yes, stalking and doxxing people, classic harmless internet fun!
1:05 I really wanna play this game🤣
They all look exactly how you imagine
My buddy who has ASD and is a bit socially awkward got harassed and bullied by 20+ women he's never met because he broke up with his gf that cheated on him
I'd Bet it was probably some unpatched flaw or misconfigured server that got them owned. The irony though is wild.
your fucked if you photo copy your cac card.  Retired dod, trust me that’s a massive no no.
That app is illegal so fuck your fun..
Women who cant get a man.. hate a man
so they think it fun to target and harass men because your more important then other humans
What will they come up with next. They're amazing. Nobody saw that coming.  Harvard?
That which goes around, doth come around, bitch
Ugly people (both inside and out) who go on to alter their appearance to 'not cater to the male gaze' has got to be one of the pathetic things out there. Deep down I do feel sorry that they will waste the majority of their lives trying to battle something that is so minor however their attitudes and needs to be the victim push that feeling way way down.
So in other words, those who like to doxx others, don't like it when they get doxxed themselves?  I get the idea of a network of keeping people safe from bad men, but the reason these women were encountering bad men was because they were in places where the bad men go. ie bars, parties, and clubs.
Hypocrites. This Dating "Tea App" Was Highly Illegal and The Developers and Users Shall Be Prosecuted To The Fullest Extent Of The Law!
what's with this wig and fake video filters?
Here's where the burka comes in handy.
This situation is pathetic for both parties, have sex, maybe you'll act like a normal person after that 🙄
1:33 who told her that it might look good?
I don't think chick with the booger catchers has a thing to worry about....
Only weird chicks use this app?
This is what happens when you get rid of the right to use the back hand....  Women like this.
why do they all look like THAT
Victim mindset speedrun WR?
Especially if you have horrible bangs. If you think slamming men online is a 'good time on the internet', you just told everyone how horrible you are.
People I'd never date for 1000 Alex.
Man their really spilling the tea aren’t they
bro they should be grateful that its legal to use those haircuts
The two that are even half ass pretty, look like they lezbos anyways lmao the other only date black men lol
Glasses? Let's talk about that fucking hairline lol bitch looks like Simple Jack
Revenge of the Unfukables
The Glasses Gal is Anne/Annie Miner (Pressman).  She's maybe divorced now.  Shes from Hudson/Catskill/Albany NY.  She's as jewish as they come.  Everyone aside from her in her family are lawyers and she is a work from home "project manager" that gets paid for having no skills aside from replying to emails and her parents paid for her to graduate from Boston University.  She's exactly as stupid in person ss you expect her to be. Btw she is pushing 41-42.
When you play the game and have no idea you might lose😂
Very nice of the Tea app to get a bunch of undatable women to compile themselves into a list for us all to avoid.
Always when i watch these im just amazed that its never even 6/10 women complaining about it. Its always some 2/10 girl hating on it
It's called tuff shit 😂😂😂😂🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
You know what this shitfeck is like just by looking at her/he/them/it/pigdog
hmm, guys where prosicuted because of a list with female names, it stated how they where in bed etc. then another guy or two because they spread this list online. I agree with the judge, that list was insane. But what is this??? The same thing but with men?! And that shit is ok? Weird how that works....
A woman with that hairstyle is crazy. Look at those bangs.
THAT  FRINGE RAISE ALL ALARMAS ................... FRINGE ALERT NIVEL 9............ GREETINGS FROM ARGENTINA .... HERE THW WOKISM IS THE SAME CR4P..................
So, there IS a place where ugly broads meet up!
I remember a student group formed a FB page called "gentlemens club" and got blasting for making comments about female colleagues. Somehow in the opposite direction it's okay
That haircut?  What's up with that!
No, women can have fun online remember? They can be empowered by doing the Only......thingy 🤷 Oh, and by bashing men and other women too
0:12 Anyone watch Good Mythical Morning?  Tell me she doesn’t look like some messed up girl gen z version of Link?
My ex went on some dating site...gave them ALL of her personal data, and now she is calling me to help her with her rent, because her bank account got emptied, her phone bill went through the roof because it was hacked in some way that people were making overseas calls on her number through call forwarding...that part I don't know how it works.      The funny part is, because they gained so much access to her whole life, I am now getting tons of spam in the mailbox because I GOT THE HOUSE in the divorce, so this address is part of the hack I guess. I sent her an email to ask how are things but she doesn't reply because she said she doesn't see my emails....through the HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of emails she is now getting everyday on her phone, and not into the spam filter ....right into her focused email folder ...haha...I tried to leave her a message on her phone but when I called her, it went directly to a fake "voice messaging" system I never heard of and it asked me to punch in MY four pin access to my phone to message HER !!!     As of today, I am using ONLY a virtual operating system on a back up computer with a VPN client server that I just purchased. I do not answer to any phone calls on my phone unless they are in my contact list.     Here is how they got her...They hacked into her Facebook and shut it down..she went online and typed in " how to unlock Facebook" and called the FIRST number that popped up on her screen, which was a fake Facebook number where they had to verify who she was by giving her passwords, full name, etc and THEN they said they had to "get into" her computer to fix Facebook, and that is how they got her bank account...she did not even have 2 step verification set up. . .
Interesting fact Around 20% of 18 to 29 year old women in America have nose rings  Around 36% of the top 50 most attractive women who use Tea app have nose rings Around 20% of the top 50 most unattractive women have a nose ring  Seeing how there have been some studies that link nose rings to a higher chance of mental illness, the question is Why is the Tea app so appealing to mentally unstable women?
Imagine getting a bridge piercing and its crooked lol
i wonder if a new category for disabled whatever they are is needed
Women are so hypocritical it is actually crazy
Oh poor ugly freaks dont get to make fun of guys they would never have a chance in hell with and dox them i feel so sad for them lmao
We need a "Cofee" App ☕
A woman with bangs that short aren't allowed to make fun of men for being in cells because they're also in cells
ANYONE with hairstyles like that clearly love men, c'mon.
Oof
They're so fugly that incels would rather remain virgins than screw them.
Ya'll remember that scene from Lord of the Rings where the Urak-hai are created?
I don't understand why unattractive women insist on making themselves even less attractive with excessive tats and so much metal in their faces they look like victims of a shrapnel grenade.  THEN they wonder why they are still single.
Apparently, accountability is their kryptonite
also if the apps ToS was excluding men, I feel like that's probably illegal. you know, because of anti-discrimination laws.
Last I checked, the Lord God labeled gossip as a sin, not as something fun to do without consequence.
Those glasses and those bangs...  Yuck.
See a trend here stay away from the biotches with straight bangs
the haircut in germany is called: "Problem-Pony". It's not only the glasses :D
That is a man pretending to be a woman. The roach watches you all laugh. The u.s. is COOKED
Farkin . Lol.
I mean their intent was to create a hate list of unbearable people.  Little did they know they made the list to the public its just that they volunteered their names on it.
The Tea app was/is a digital lynch mob. And while I can understand the idea behind it, we _cannot_ have a free for all use of this kind of power to ruin people's lives.  There needs to be strict federal laws for this kind of thing.
Funny as hell when she says "You don't get to be safe there". Good, "neither do you"  Sauce for the goose. Now we are even.  To demand a safe place and do so acting like it is ok to do to the other side what they UNO Reverse back onto you, is, just, ironic.
I'm not really convinced any of those women show could actually get dates.
A woman who chose those glasses and that haircut has some nerve talking about her people being "at it again". "Nasty" people were easily able to gain access to the app. That's by design. How else were the Jabba's using it supposed to access it?
Can we just take this to every government body and say "Oh you want to Age-Gatekeep the internet to protect kids by extorting all our data so you can spy on our internet movement? Damn, looks like that already happened and now millions of adult women are at risk of danger. Do you not care about women? Not caring about women just means you're basically a predator"
Femme nazis on hiatus now
It's crazy to me the amount of hate certain men and women seem to have for one another it's kinda scary
These are the same women that'd be in favor of putting all men and boys into camps so we could all be checked out like library books at there convinience, which was the original Feminist vision of how they want complete control over all men at all times.
Wow what bridge did that thing crawl out from under?
Amazing how none of these women could be over a 5 even in a dark room
*DESTROYED*
what funny is that more than half those woman are soo ugly there absolutly no way those guy date them , their just angry no one want them and trashing on random guy on the internet cause lets be honest they didn't have a date been a while
TeaSpill is literally a modern version of facemash.
One of the things just show that all Humans are just shitty and should experience the abyss lol
Why are these women always gross?
Wasent it a woman who actually got in and leaked everything
Feminazis: How dare you dox me while I am unashamedly doxxing you!  Me: Yep, definitely some grade A female logic there...lol
that last 5 seconds!! HAHAHAHA
“Thought we wouldn’t find out!!?!?”-Randy Marsh in Banes voice
Of course you are the victim
“I'm sure the universe is full of intelligent life. It's just been too intelligent to come here.”, ― Arthur C. Clarke
Was that a dating service or a cattle auction?
Doxxers get pissed off that they got doxxed.
that app was genius, only women you dont want would sign up.
Glorious.
1:30 Who tf would see this abomination of a face and think, ‘Hmm seems like wife-material to me’🤦 I guess that’s why she was on this app to begin with
Now suddenly gender only spaces are good again? Lol
The NSA KNOWS YOU CNT!😂
Birth control glasses.😂
They're all the same woman 😂 chubby with thick ass glasses.
101 Karens
They’re mad because it exposed their weight 😂
Holy shit, seriously. There are, maybe TWO, okay looking women in there and "okay" being 3-5. Everyone else? The nastiest sacs of week-old salmon yeast in a Jack Daniels fermenting barrel.
Some random app wants verification by official government ID?   And those women are OK with that?      Damn, I have to think about why I need to give my official information to secure government websites, before I do it!      Those women are upset that an app from some random internet website wasn't secure and their official ID information and location was exposed and leaked?          Heck, I went through 3 different back ground investigations for government security clearances.   I had to provide information back to what hospital I was born in!   Guess what?  My data was in """secure""" government computers which were hacked and I along with 3 million others with security clearances were downloaded and shared!
WE NEED INSANITY LAWS!!!!!
You're upset that someone leaked your personal information on the internet in order to mock and belittle you? Yes I imagine that sort of thing would upset someone.
Eeeef, those nasties never need fear men As another type of dog would say: ruff
Fat angry cat ladys
Tea was probably created by a man with this exact outcome on mind.
I think it's funny that they got exposed The unwanted the undateable
They look like spuds with no personality id be mad if I was them
she's 260 bro
I actually calculated the BMI for three of the people at the end. Would anyone be surprised to hear that all were overweight/obese?
They all have the worst bangs.
She has bangs up on her 5 head.. and I thought my hairline was bad.
OMG!   Those glasses!  That huge nose ring!   Those bangs!   What men were they reporting, the ones who wouldn't agree to date them?
Looking at their faces , yup that app was made by femcels .
Honey? Could you make me a cup of tea? Possibly violence ensues…
Wtf kinda creature am I looking at?!? Busted ass haircut, stupid glasses, and libtard mentality
Uhhh.... those are definitely chew your arm off kind of females. The amount of alcohol I would have to drink, to drown out all self respect, would put a town into an alcohol induced coma. Yuckee!
I can't bear the whispery, faux calm voice they put on. You can hear the rage and aggression simmering underneath. Just let go and show the world your true colours. The acting is terrible!!
Imagine if there was a site where you couldn't join unless you were a man?
Isnt doxxing illegal? Tea is man doxxing.
The one thing these women hate more than men is themselves. Who would do such horrible things to your own body? This was some instant karma, maybe instead of installing tea, you drink some instead of Mountain Double Dew Sirup.
I have a fun time in the internet every day
Imagine thinking there’s EVER enough security lmao
Caught the hogs in the trap
That's a woman?
That's hilarious and SO SO just.  Maybe I made a mistake choosing to be atheist as a kid - THIS feels like divine justice.     As for the first whiner - she should try living in Britain atm.  Although thinking about it - SHE'D probably be perfectly "free" in our shithole of a country.
1:4chan army 2:american army
Played a stupid game, won a stupid prize.
An eye for an eye, a dox for a dox.
Why do these women make themselves unfuckable?
0:50 why HD2 anthem?
Men also cheat down for plausible deniability. "What?" "With her ugly fat ass?" "No way. You're so much hotter." 😂🤣😂🤣🤷
notice how attractive and hot the men are and how yk the women look
Oh no, the doxxing-app users got doxxed. Karma?
eye glass and hair.....no fly zone
Mean girls doxxing men mad that men can dox them back 😂
So let me get this straight:  Your defense of 4Chan users who are cyberbullying the women whose accounts were hacked is that these women are ugly?
Did... did i hear the SUPER EARTH ANTHEM during the "tea spill" clip ?!?!?
Why do all the women look like they have never dated any of these men? The two women who created videos are clearly batting for the other team or my radar is just that good it's blocking problems before the happen, minority report style. 😂
Oh nooo my libel app was shut down by the incels 😂😂😂
what chin beard 300 lb beta male is dating these.... "women?"
Fun time on the internet is bashing men. Ok
"Apparently that shit was not secure, and all that info got leaked!" - Ooh hey, that sounds just like what all those men said!
Super Earth anthem playing in the background. I see what you did there :D
LoL you need an ID to join this stupid app but not to vote huh? Thanks tards.
‏‪0:09‬‏  what  a nice trans men 😂
Can anyone confirm if the "hack" was really just someone making public domain info forefront in the news?
ahhh, karma is nice
“Where’s the beef?” The TEA app apparently.
Tea: "Hey, we've compiled a list of the worst men alive! Let's all hate them together!" The worst women alive: "OMG YASSSSSSSSSSSS!!! WE ALL NEED TO SIGN UP!!!!!!" Tea: "Oh by the way, we don't know what cybersecurity is! LOL! Oopsie!" Hacker: "Hey, we've assembled a list of the most obnoxious women on the planet! Let's all hate them together!" The worst women alive: "Oh no. Oh no no no no no no no. NoOoOoOoOoOoOoO!"
w hackers
Doxxing Karens get doxxed, whine about it, don't understand lack of public sympathy.
Wtf is that a dude with a mullet??
Link the game pussies
>especially if you're a woman  Okay but first please define "woman"
4 chan sometimes i love you
0:18 I heard that song from the hd2 flag mission
helldiver background audio approved
😂😂😂😂 I mean, if you're fine with eating catfish, these ladies are for you. Another curtain torn away, revealing the pathetic man posing as a wizard
Wow. That 1st lady is doing everything to make herself ugly.
All the ‘Left’ does nowadays is placate to the lowest common denominators while solidifying ‘the boy who cried wolf’ trope   ‘if you still see it as red v blue they got you 😏’   cool story bro
In the military, we called those (birth control glasses)! For obvious reasons!😂
Who knew the Tea app was home to a Pod of Whales.
Those ugly who wouldnt be able to pay a man to sleep with them have the audacity to take the hugh ground and call detractors 'incels' smh
The irony, a lunatic woke nutter who is a part of what has made not just the internet but life nowadays no fun complains about people stopping them have fun. So the tolerant left have fun by being vile and hateful, ok, got it
Best part of this incident is the fact that we can use it as an argument to show why we shouldnt allow to verify with our personal information
*Another W for 4chan.* 😂
Someone should send this to Marsha Blackburn (sponsor of kids online safety act) to explain why age verification is such a shit idea
With a hair cut like that not the glasses 😂😂
Those are some disgusting and diseased looking creatures lol.
Wretched sows, feel good?
"didn't set up enough security measures" - they literally didn't set up ANY. Publicly available S3 bucket. I'm in the tech industry and am amazed how many con-artists are in it (and celebrated).
You know, to be fair. If it were just about sharing bad experiences with people that are cheating (without telling the people they're meeting), or a complete asshole on a date, that wouldn't be too bad. Using it to shame guys that it didn't work out with is just cruel and vindictive though. On the plus side it does mean that if you did get unfairly shamed on that app then you're less likely to get matched with women who use that app, it was self filtering.
How can you be 5'3, 200lbs, and talk sooo much shi*?
See the actually hilarious this is that it’s illegal to make copies of DOD IDs like that. Fucking dummy
I heard it was a woman that did the hack. If you can call it that, they stored IDs on a public server
Whale, whale, whale...
01:31
The pictures of those XXX plus-sized 304 wannabes gave my neighbor's 3 legged Chihuahua PTSD, & explosive diarrhea...
You reap what you sow, ladies.
"You can't have fun on the internet, especially if you are a woman". And if a man were to EVER make an App like this, he'd be doxxed and Swatted in the first week.  Actually, why do I feel like somebody did try to do something similar, and did get bullied out of making the app?
Actually, not NASTY. Here's the thing: You should NEVER be comfortable with giving your personal information over the internet. I mean, COME ON. This was going to happen eventually; it was an app designed to leak personal information about other people. How high was the security ever going to be?
did they only accept the ugly women for that app or wtf is going on here?
App women uses to doxx and slander men hacked, women most affected  😂
wtf was that
Nothing is safe online, it’s designed to be stolen later, duhhhh
I want to know if the person that cut her hair went to jail.
She looks like Rock Lee from Naruto, and some chick had a child, and this is it.
its always the fat women who weren't named karen.
🤢🤢🤢,….🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
If you don't want your info to get found, you don't get online.
Ew
Dumb bitches, lol. This is also technically slander and defamation technically
Karma was much swifter than usual.
Broother, the trolls
"somebody nasty" like the scuzzy hoes using the app
These people on "Tea" can't even find their way out of a wet paper sack, how were they supposed to create a safe website? These are the same people you want raising your children and teaching them at public schools. It's always the same disenfranchised (ugly as hell) women and freaks.
The Doxxer has become the Doxxhund
"Liberated" women plus  social media = societal colllapse.
she sez "head on a swivel ladies" wasn't on a swivel when she gave her I.D. to the doxing app tho eh.
Those glasses? What about that haircut 😅
An app that presumably meant to help protect women from abusive men.... Stored and failed to encrypt location data....
US putting your weight on the ID card? 😮😮😮  Why??? 😂😂😂😂
Yeah personally I love reading 1 star reviews on amazon because it tell you a lot more about the person whose leaving the review more than the product itself! And my gut feeling is the same goes for that website where a woman can review the endless cue of men she's dated and make sure everyone knows its all the fella fault the date didn't work out as everyone knows since the dawn of time a woman's never gotten anything worn or at least that's what they all like to tell themselves and eachother in hope of making it true
I was distracted a moment and I jump of scare when i looked at this alien at 1:31
hey, i'm from brazil, and this is funny bro hahahaha
Dang; I'm a 6' M and I only managed 235lbs. I'm impressed :O
Man 4chan does the work of gods sometimes. If there are any 4channers in the comments i tip my hat to you good sirs.
Karma is a bitch huh?
If man did some like that and an ap like that??!! Bro...i couldn't imagine the disaster that will result.of it. And im 100% sure that social, media etc.. will cry so loud that just the deaf ones will be safe. Fu*king hypocrisy. 40E
Many of the men were on there because "they didn't return messages". So a 1 sends a 9 a message and then the 1 doxxes the guy for "being a creep" and not talking to her.
Nevermind the glasses, that haircut is just sad. That's not a fringe or a bowl cut😢
l
With those glasses fun is the 2nd thing she wants you to have
All those women looked exactly how I figured they would
Turn about IS fair play.
I just use my genitals for peeing now. Dating is problematic for a self-preservationist.
why do they complain. the way they look, they got ZERO guys.
Soooo tea app was banned or?
Nice haircut!
App exists that's primarily used to dox and gossip about men. Women most affected
What's up with Feminists always calling the kettle black....It's a really bad look in 2025
Why aren't they still having a fun time on the internet? I don't get it. Can somebody explain why it's not fun when their photos are released? Can't we just have some fun too?
I want to make fun of them but every joke I try to make seems TOO easy
A bunch of 2’s and 3’s.
To start with the app: how do you prove you are a female? By taking a picture of yourself and showing your ID? Well, well, well... So, if a man puts in a wig and lipstick, but you can clearly see his Adam's apple, that's not a woman? How the turntables...
Glasses are fine, but what’s up with those bangs
What a goofy ass haircut she has. She looks fucking stupid lol
Where is this list? I would love to see if there are any of my ex-‘s on there.
When Men did this, it was seen as sexist and shut down. Women do this, it's incompetent and they get ragged all over the Internet, but lists keep disappearing.
just a bunch of wee 3x3's
4chan out there balancing the scales again.
They should post the names of the guys they talked about. They should know
"Somebody nasty was able to access all that information."  Yes, you and however many other women were able to access all that personal information with your subscriptions.
Doxxing people based on gender. Hilarious. Class action law suit time?
The first two things in the beginning could not possibly be women. I mean honestly, WTF were those...were they even human? Why are they worried? No guy who can see, smell, hear, or feel would want those things near them.
Playing victim because of your shit box code and security measures that led to a major leak of peoples private information doesn't justify the statment "women aren't allowed to have fun on the internet". Get gud or gtfo with your bullshit doxxing app and ugly ahh glasses you wanna be nerd.
Just another internet moment that I have absolutely zero idea what y'all talking bout.... Huge W
Oh man if the genders were reversed on this one.... hahaha  Imagine if there was an app with a database of women lol.
And none of them admitted to being over 200 lbs either. What a shame.
The invisible women....the ones men will never see,    mad.   They dont like it when it happens to them
WOAH THE fuckin forehead on that...thing, at 0:12.
I have a hard time believing half these women even had real dates to rate. They probably just started rating people they work with or live on their block. I mean, did they even have to prove that a date ever happened?
Did that app ever operate in the EU? GDPR violations with a potential of huge fines, etc.
lololololol the age with the weight is fking hilarious.
I’ve never met or hung out with a females over 190lbs
The television series, "The View" has evolved.
have fun? from what I can see it was made to hs* on guys, not have fun.
doxxers got doxxed
Men create the vast majority of software. Technology is for the boys.
The irony is fucking amazing 😂😂😂
Do these, and i use the term loosely, women cut their own hair? It would explain a lot if they did.
The biggest Selfreport ever :D
Tea spill lol... 😂
Fuck around find out
When you declare war on 4chan you lose.
You created a site dedicated to doxing people and were shocked and appalled it happened to you, it's almost like there's a reason people don't do that shit... Oh yeah because it's illegal immoral and ruins people's lives/leads to identity theft.
Please let the hacker be a Female. Please for once.
Alerta do flequillo!!
I'm so glad there was no mansplaning about site/data security.
Lmao
What was their plan keeping all that info?  There is no way you need to keep the photo id after you verify it.  What they fid is in breech of GPDR for example IIRC.
Soo many ugly clones
If they only need the ID to verify that the user is a woman. Why did they store that information? In exchanges or finance applications it's necessary to store this info just in case the gov asks for it, but in this case? Play stupid games, win stupid prices
Oh no… Anyway, how’s everyone’s day going?
"I knew it, I kneew it"  we all did 🤣😂
"Can't even be safe because our data is out there with malicious intent" as if they weren't promoting an app that PUTS DATA OUT THERE WITH MALICIOUS INTENT this blatant hipocresy isn't even intentional, these foids are pissing me off very badly and the fact that we can't even do anything abt it because they're just THAT mentally challenged pisses me off even more
If women were incels this would be them.  Your typical fatass psycho libtards, the ones you take one look at and can tell they foam at the mouth at the sight of a red hat.
Context is fine, but don't show the actual images on doxxing people
Asmon repent and accept the Lord Jesus Christ quickly.
I think this was part of the master plan
This is like a GPS app that encourages people to stay where they are. Or a baseball skills app that shows batters getting hit in the face with a fastball. 🤣
I am so sick of the hate towards "incels". Like being sexless and wanting to be in a relationship is something to be hated and mocked. (But, only if you are a guy). But of course, if anyone turns a WOMAN down, they MUST be gay or a pedo. I mean, can we please stop acting like other people's sex lives are any of our business? Men who lack intimacy and want it have a hard enough time already. And no, I don't mean the people who go nuts and start bashing women or stalking them or some other crazy BS. Quit lumping everyone in with the fringe crazies.
Wait wait wait they got 4channed!!!!!
Honestly, they’re all cartoonishly disgusting. This is why serfs weren’t allowed to learn to read or write.
Do these “women” all go to the same hair dresser and say “make me look insane”?
I hear the super earth anthem
I noticed that the woman who uesd this app are Ether old or fat but also ugly and miserable.
So lemme wrap my head around this Karen logic. Karen exposes information: "Imma badass bitch." Karen has her information exposed: "I'm an innocent victim exploited by terrible people."
damn!  that's a nasty leak! Edit: just had a thought.. in some of those jurisdictions there are laws against doxxing people.  I seem to recall in some places it is even a felony.  Seems to me there should be some lawsuits filed.. just to make the point if nothing else.
I choose to believe she's wearing those glasses ironically.
I wonder how the Tea members feel about Snowden and Assange?
The Tea app wasn't made by WOMEN, right?  It was made by men! And the app is designed for DOXXING.  Is that legal? A MAN made the Tea app, collected personal info that was WILLINGLY given, then doxxed the doxxers. Stupid women fell into a trap designed and built by a man, intended to f*ck with men, and got UNO reversed.  LOL.
They only hate and reject men on that site because it is a form of revenge or retaliation due to being never approached, turned down by men 😂
0:13 he's right, just look at the Slug receptionist in Monsters Inc. she got the same damn frames!
The fact that that it's basically being used all over America and every woman is using it basically means the whole concept of dating is dead there, i can only assume a massive population drop is gonna show up after a year maybe less
1:29 Right there.  The eyes. The fucking eyes every time. The Japanese have a name for it; sanpaku eyes. It's integral to the physiognomy of psychopaths and other dangerous freaks.
Ugly women that want to bash on all men 😂
A girl I was talking to showed me they do this on Facebook groups too. Who's boyfriend is this or something like that. Aimed at cheaters but ends up just them talking crap on everyone. They blast your dating profiles and socials. Crazy
So does this mean "Tea" is an acronym for Toxic Entitled A$$holes?
Hmmm 🤔 this is the first run at recruiting women for a formal stazi.   Like contact tracers from 2020.    Imagine trusting an app creator.   Social credit score by fellow citizens
When nerds do cool stuff
❤❤❤❤❤❤
That first chick, what was that on her head? Was it hair, or black felt beanie, or a dead cat? I couldn't tell.  ETA: It was actually her hair! Good golly Miss Molly! Between that awful hair thing, that retarded grin, and those glasses,  she's a solid 5 ... on a scale from 1 to 100.
4chan is a blessing  Those "women" are the type that their toys scream noooooo!!!!
This is actually hilarious
crazy
Maybe those "women" should consider the possibility that they are not dating material. I didn't see a single 1 that was over a 2 on the scale. Their attitudes seem to be peni$ repelent as well.
It's been said but necessary to say again - there was NO security and the devs had to purposely override default security.
That woman is not dating men.
Them's some plug-uglies!
So do they know who leaked the info? Are these women thinking it's a man? LOL it be funny if it was actually a woman or a trans.
Why do these women think we're supposed to feel bad for them?
I dont care about the opinions of ugly people  Sorry not sorry
Rofl
Had nothing to do with safety.  And the modern women's movement cannot handle when what they are doing is then used against them..DOUBLE STANDARD
Funny how its two lesbians talking about the leak like as if they used it themselves when its all about shaming men from a hoochie culture perspective.     Hateful lesbians are always doing something theyd never allow men to do openly.
Why are white women so weird rn
Woman at 8 seconds went to the barber and said “just fuck my shit up bro”
Karma is a bitch, bitches.
I am surprised american driving licenses have the person's weight! But to be fair, if it just said overweight after, it would be accurate for most of USA population!
the tea leak had 90% ugly ass women who are not in the position to talk the shit they do
Theyre all atrocious.  Dudes do better.  At least dont reproduce with them.
What goes around, comes around. 🤣🤣
Women with those glasses and that weirdo haircut def don't want you to have fun
Had no idea this existed, can’t even believe its real
This is a perfect example of what you get when you shelter your kids from birth. Hear me out. Dating good and bad people help you form and tweak your personality within the world. You work through rejection and bad breakups. You learn what the opposite sex wants and what you are lacking. This Tea site and Tinder eliminate all of the fun and necessity of dating. You cut out all of the hard stuff and just get to the good stuff and they're surprised their personal and romantic lives are a wreck? Leave it to the tech world to say that thousands of years of evolution and personal relationships can be replaced by a free app.
All liberal women look the same, don't they? ROFL
Wtf are those bangs?
holy fuck (big eyes)
She/it said "Head on a swivel..." and then used the word "ladies" which seems to be quite the stretch.
how can it be leaked when it was in a public folder?
None of these people are capable fighters, just angry and deluded feminist...
The app is just a bunch of old fat unattractive women griping and complaining about how they are still single and its not them
I like how these women cry foul play and "doxxing is illegal" and yet they are on an app that literally is about doxxing men they don't like.
This might be the most succinct summary of human history possible
Anyone with those bangs isn't getting a guy anyways and you would see them online making fun of men. All this app is is a left wing women's freedom to just bash on men without repricusions because you have to get validated in order to join and 100% the mods aren't accepting men
Wildly unattractive
Women and accountability are like oil and water
App called Tea and it leaks. Pottery
I mean her face is a dating advice by itself, along with a haircut and glasses. But I guess male murrikans are that desperate.
These are the type of women that will turn a straight man gay.
There is no absolutely no freaking way any of those "women" ever dated a guy, period! They were absolutely disgusting.
medieval serf in the front and 80's rockstar in the back
Let me get this right. . they used an app to gossip and talk about others, and are now upset it's being done to them and that they have been exposed. Hmm, I think there is a word for that  Kam. . no. . Kar. . not quite. . oh yeah KARMA b*tches.
If this didn’t destroy the app a deluge of lawsuits would have, potentially even ones related to gendered discrimination. The founder is extremely lucky that it didn’t get far enough to be pulled into a massive class action.
Is that an AI voice giving the recap? If so, I really like it.
This is Mark Zuckerberg type shi
I don't believe any of those weights
bruh even governments get hacked, why tf would you assume some lidl app would be safe ?
Humankind is more dumb than ever. Did technology helped us in being stoobid?
why men dont create the men only app and call it "teabag"
That haircut is as bad as her face, glasses, attitude and horrid personality.
Someone's exposed their pictures, names and locations to a public forum for mockery and shit talking?  Unbelievable
To be fair though....  That app looks goofy as fuck, it looked like a joke, I would probably have downloaded it if I'm a women just for fun and giggles.
Wait, they put your weight on your ID in the US?
4chan stays undefeated
Whomp whomp for the walruses
1:57 182 press x to doubt
A collection  of ugly women who can't get dates
"explain yourself burgers" lololol
why is that dude in the first vid talking about women's life?
😂😂😂😂😂
why do i hear Heldivers 2 Democarcy song on the background????
Aww they don’t like it when it’s their turn in the shame corner
The amount of short hair😂
These haircuts, tho.
the helldivers theme lol
Dont worry, the girls on the videos are safe 😂
Doxxers fafo'd
What got leaked is a bunch of lying delusional women docking men they probably never even met. Modern women truly have morphed into Wiley coyote, sitting on a keg of dynamite, while lighting it everything they do blows up in their face and yet they never, never ever ever learn these are just flat out ugly women no one is dating them. Except for the delusions in their heads.
W 4chan once again
The falsely defaming males on Tea App is similar to how white women falsely accused black men of r@pe and had them lynched and myrdered which is seen in literary works like Dry September and To Kill a Mockingbird
none of these fukpigs have value
Yeah mate when you See the Wild and Wacky Glasses, 🥸 You Know that you are Dealing with a Clown 🤡 👍😁👍🇬🇧🧷☠️
Reap what you sow.
Only if people cared about doing this to revenge corn websites
Whoever told them to get these haircuts is not their friend lmao
TFS wrong with these people?
Misery loves company sums up this app pretty well.
Scary looking women angry that they got partially doxed after totally doxing men, cry me a river!
Aaaaw sweet! Eldritch horrors beyond human comprehension!
I dont believe these women were dated but more just one night stand
Tea spilling women: we're going to expose all these bad men. Men: hold my 🍺
Did your editor just slap the Super Earth Anthem on this video?   If he did, you should pay him more.
this is hilarious. all women share the same personality online btw.
From personal experience I don't think these women are anti-fun at all, they are more about super crazy mental fun.
I live in EU, we have GDPR, I cant see how this app would see the light of day here
Yup
They WANTED REVENGE  on men... "they WANTED TO BE DOXXERS" 😅  just like the bible story tells us that  Herodias wants John the Baptists head...on a silver platter;   After her daughter Salome dances for king herod... king herod grants her wish!  😮
Short bangs used to be a skin girl  trait. Now the feminists adopted it.
"What? All of the information that I put on the internet isn't secure?"
those flat bangs are a huge red flag on dating sites, instant left-swipe
The app should have been called CokBlok.
It's okay to be sexist as long as it's targeted towards men
That DoD id card is a USID. She's most likely a dependent to someone who is serving. See how the first letter on the top right of the ID card looks like an S?? Yeah, definitely gotta be the Spouse USID card...
Modern women are complete hypocrites. Every woman on that app has TEN or more great guys that would treat them like gold but they don’t want those guys. They all would rather fight over the top 10% of men who are elite level attractive and treat them like trash. And when I say trash I use it lightly because ghosting isn’t a crime just bc it’s a man doing it!
4CHAN is our army of Incels. Perhaps the greatest machine of war ever created.
It’s always the most disgusting looking ones😂😂
The leak is by far the most powerful argument to appeal the 19th Amendment
wonder if any of us who have been single for 8+ years is on the app
I’m so glad you mention the ugly glasses in the beginning
All the women that use the app sure so have a common look don't they 🤣
"Incels are at it again" says the femcel. Born to marry each other but blocked by pure hatred for one another.
Whoa, need an ID for the app but not to vote because that would be ....
1:10 this lady has the Gew nose
Oops, people dont like their information being spread among random people?
Doesnt include Teans women eh! Thats not fair! 😂
Another loss for feminism
So let me get one thing straight; so these women have no issues when an app asks govt. issued IDs for verification and they would have american people convinced that documentation isn't essential to be able to vote??
My misogyn level is over 9000 !
Holy mother of fat beaches! Perhaps beauty is important after all
1:02 Was that the fucking Super Earth Anthem???
How can you comment the glasses and just glance over the hair?
Thankfully in EU we have GDPR. This application would be fined into the oblivion for collecting personal data of those men, without their consent.
Incels, yeah when I look at them I want to be gay
lol whys it always the uglies
Lots of pictures of ship ballast there!
Damn karma is a beach
Nice bangs! LOL! pumpkin pie haircutted lil FREAK!
1.30 - this thing has scared me.
a small hat harlot, surprise surprise
If some random ass app is making me upload sensitive info like my DL or Passport in order to use it, I ain’t using it.
“No one can have a fun time on the internet”  GIRL you can’t call leaking private convo/info you have on a guy after dating him, talking behind people’s backs, and potentially causing fake rumors which could even ruin their lives “having fun”.  These women would KILL US if we men did the reverse; an app where we talk about women, and some of us spread lies. And rightfully so. Because that is not just “having fun”.  Ah but I forgot. Bullies have fun in bullying. Apologies, what she said checks out
WTF is up with her hair?
Do those bitches really believe they pull a proper man with that style? They literaly radiate hate and ugly soul
Why is it the ugly girls that always ruin the Betty Paige haircut
1:11 I thought maybe she was going to say that the users shared responsibility. It WAS an app to dox men. I must be delusional, she would never voluntary accept accountability 😂
They just brought back facemash  😂😂😂😂😂😂
The war thunder soundtrack?!?!
90% of all women only want 20% of all men theory gaining so much traction holy fuck.
1:27 remember the Apparently Kid? He transitioned.
The Tea Spill website is literally being censored everywhere but the Teaapp is still fine... Man I just can't
Just real feminist man-haters, attacking men.
This is just another round of play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
it wasn't even a hack, it was just sitting on an unencrypted, un secure URL
"I am a doxxer, and I find the doxing of myself fellow doxxers to be an absolute outrage!" - Actual Tea App user...in-sum.
Funny shit is that the 2 talking had the same hair cut. We need to make a database like what LEOs use for identifying gang and terrorists members by like tattoos, clothing color etc.
hags
4chan has become the world's leading intelligence agency. The CIA and FSB have nothing to compare.
Go to the party section in any Walmart. Purchase all the 0.99 cent giant novelty joke sunglasses. Pop out the lenses and sell the frames as “high fashion” for $500 to mor*ns
Bangs are the giveaway
why are they all hogs?  I mean stupid question, we know why.
An app full of women that opened their cheeks for a mcdouble. That post nut clarity is some shit.😂
That haircut, did her 2 yro baby Jamallequan Joonsun Jr. Cut her fuffing hair???
Don't take it down! If all the hogs want to wallow in the same pen it keeps them in the next farm.
5 feet 260 is crazy
But a similar app for the make gender was swiftly removed!   EVERYONE TOGETHER NOW: “DOUBLE STANDARD MUCH!”
How many troons were on there,  pretending to be chicks?
Wait, they weigh you for your driver's license in America? Or did that psycho actually pencil in 182 as if the 2 was an important detail?
And put this same aspect that's going on with the 💩 censorship act, a good example 😂
Governments AND corporations want us to upload ID's and other PII to access anything considered "adult" content or even restrictive...   "It's secure" "It's the only way to protect"   Yeahhh no. That will be hacked in a week max
Bro, how am I just now finding this channel?
Wow the doxxing app got leaked I wonder why.
Way to go men, It's our world.
Why care about the looks of a woman when it's her actions that she should be judged for?
Who cuts she/it’s hair a beaver? 😊
They aren't incels, they're just not into you.
Thar she blows!
Femcels at it again.
The tea leak are all pedos on bluesky
Girl in the cover photo can tea me any day
So glad i dont have to play that game XD
We’ve had texts from last night to expose bad gfs, shitty friends, horrible parents and rotten people. Women are just now catching up?
What I find mind blowing is that there are ANY men still dating in 2025. I mean talk about scraping the bottom of the sewer.
Now we need an app to check if the women we are seeing were on the Tea app
Literally all these chicks look like sad single liberal douchebags. I'm not surprised.
a safe space for miserable people to be terrible miserable people, yes... yes... We must continue to allow shitty people to self identify.
“Having fun”= spreading lies and doxing men without accountability.
Damm. Too quote Wanda Sykes. "U G L Y you ain't got no alibi. You . . . "
Why are these whales worried?  That's all of North America
can't fix stupid
dude, those are some gnarly looking fat broads.
Now we need Coffee an app men can check to make sure a woman wasn’t on the tea app
All of these woke chicks look the same. 😅
The greatest gotcha of 2025 would be finding out it was a woman hacker that pulled this off 🤣
"Someone nasty got in there and leaked the info"  You mean as nasty as the collective of users on the app?
Poor bud doesn't even realize these are the only types of women he could ever have a chance with lol.
the alt girl millenial to karen pipeline is lubed with crisco
Repeal 19A now. Most have proven themselves as vengeful,vindictive,vapid,vile,overly emotional, unreliable, willfully ignorant and unprofessional.
The bangs dude?  You missed the bangs.
lol so this Nazi app is made for hating?
And you know all those drivers license heights were over exaggerated and the weights were at least 30 pounds low.
If people like this hadn't gone after our games, then those that leaked the information might've been too busy to bother. Or maybe they just doxed someone that didn't like it.  I'm just waiting to find out that the company responsible for this app is handling the age verification checks for the UK.
Bagged by Tea.
If you asked your boyfriend he would have said not to do it.
I signed up for a doxing group and got doxed.   I don't deserve this.
In count Dankulas voice:  Oh n what happened how terrible.
Hilarious she called others incels with looks like that.
Those 3 look god awful to the bone🤮🤮🤮🤮
It got worser
"can't have fun" i had fun
To whoever put up the whole "ranking" the leaked photos from the app....  You are a legend.  The most appropriate response to this hilarious episode.
What did we learn from McArthy? Carefull making lists lest you end up on one...
getting access to the database just to leak weights of women attached to their pictures is hilarious
There's only one thing you can say to girls like her: "Oh, no... where is your septum piercing? What's wrong? Why don't you have one?"  It blows their minds and sends them running away in tears.
The woman in the thumbnail looks like one of the evil Maya from Apacolypto.
Not just the glasses, but the hair
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
click on the foid you prefer AHAHHHAHH
Ooooooo those lawsuits are going to be insane.
Complete lack of self awareness. what else is new ?
"appanrently that shit is not secure" Nothing is secure NOTHING IS SECURE if that shit isn't only in your head, it'll be found and even if it's in your head the FBI might pry it out somehow
“All dogs. No Lassies.”
😂😂😂😂😂
What's up with those hideous bangs??
Women LMAO
The app and each of those girls on the app need to be sued for leaking personal information of men online.
Women need to realize men are superior and stop trying to best us. We always have been and we always will be. We are the alphas of competition. We will win anything a weaker opponent challenges us at.
Do IDs really have your weight on them I have never noticed
the woman on this tea app are the kind no one would date.
dayum, like a library of mingers
Karma😂😂😂
Is that even a female talking ? Looks like a they them transTard to me ... also imagine if men made a app where they gave out full names pics and addresses of Woman they had issues with ... they would accuse men of trying to do crimes against them but if they do it , its just a fun game to destroy your entire existence... really goes to show u the average woman online mindset and true intentions
Ugly women help push feminism because they want access to dick they never deserved. Simple as.
Anyone who chooses those haircuts should not be expected to make any good decisions.
These women dont trust men, yet they will trust a sketchy app that requires you to show your personal ID with your personal information to get verified.   Then go all surprised pikachu when they get doxxed for doxing others. 😅😅😂
Believe me, men can survive without any of them. They can’t even open the pickle jar.
5 feet tall and 180 pounds...holy Jesus.
They should just rename the app, The Unfuckables
And coming in at 290lb.... The most miserable wom   ... Person alive!!!
She's so gross 🤢
0:19 For Superearth! Let's spread democracy!
FAFO! 🤣🤣
That ret arded btch looks like a walking talking Portlandia skit.
Rofl its an app for women... and she says women cant have fun. Delusion is just the new norm now I guess.
Men created one that had good security but it was quickly taken down lol probably because of the name "BoxScore"
All these girls are now on Russian websites. There info is being bought for Penny's on the dollar
The women on the Tea app were in the wrong, but what’s really sad is that so many thought an app like that was necessary to stay safe… and judging by this video and this comment section, there’s plenty of reason for women not to trust men. By this point you are no longer criticizing their wrongdoing, but personally attacking them, which is in no way defendable no matter what they’ve supposedly done to deserve it.  I don’t expect anyone of you to care about my comment, and for a generation that’s going through a male loneliness epidemic, you sure don’t do a lot to change that. Just saying.
Lol, maybe it is because I'm ancient, but I had zero idea this even existed.  Even when I was young and cute I had nightmare relationships, but even then even if this existed I'd not of used it. Every single relationship I'd left except one (very first b/f and I just totally  didn't understand the situation) I had a line of guys wanting to take me out. Objectively in retrospect I should have taken time between years long relationships, but well it was my reality. A ooo I broke up with the prior guy. It was a within days back in a relationship. Again not suggesting that is a positive thing, but these women having this insane I went on a bad date and I want to use my time like that baffling to me. Sooo? Instead of checking out the other prospects you're spending your time on this weirdo app? That is just insane. But, well I keep very few female friends, so is this what women do? It explains why I was the outcast in women's circles. Not that I particularly cared. I frankly am not into shopping unless it is for like a new PC, books, or other media type stuff.
So women that are unattractive and undatable made an app to expose and dox men? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 how weak can these cat ladies truly get
Doxxers get Doxxed, nice.
This is sooo funny 🤣
Where's the mens version of this shit, I'll go unload about my exs. 😂 I'm also 5'5' 280lbs and look like golem.  😂🎉
Fuckin women, i swear 😂😂😂 all the trolls that use that app really think they are something special? 😂😂 oh the delusions.
I’m glad me and my hand are very happy together 😂😂😂
What an ugly haircut😂
1:28 That’s an awful lot of chainmail in one’s face even for an orc!
Honestly I tried the tea spill and damn its full of cute women
They wanted to create a list of undateable people and they did, just not the way they wanted to. It was them the whole time!
So in a word.. every single person who participated in the app is complicit in bullying. Something that causes depression, suicide, and sometimes violence upon others.   Not only do you risk the lives of others when you bully people, but you also risk you're own life.   A bunch of entitled geese think they can bully people behind closed doors got EXACTLY what they deserved
Wtf are those bangs
Crying 😂 That one girl gained 60lbs between ID's! 😂
Lmao that thing calling people incels is funny😂
Never mind the glasses and piercings.  The bangs/hair cut is a dead give away.  As well as the undatable visage combined with excess lard.  I don't have a d1ck but I lost my bon=r looking at those beauties.
"Fun time"  (Doxing, defamation, and harassment)   "Try to stay safe there"  No one is ever truly safe, now you know.   Not surprised they all look like the same bitter woman, btw.
Yet women wonder why men don't approach them anymore
Those glasses and haircut does not allow for fun...
Far Left women give me the ick 🤢
Let 4chan find out. Thats the real big bad authority on th internet. Just to flip your flag they'll do it.
Wait how did any of those hippos even know any information on these guys, theres no chance someone actually asked them out to a date
Oh no..... men are finally realizing how much bullshit they have been putting up with. What will the ladies do when the men realize that the sex isn't worth all the bullshit?
Every chick I've seen whining about this is maybe at best....a 3 or 4.
They are literally the thing they claim to hate but lack the self awareness to realize it.  It’s amazing to witness.  Ladies, just get a real hobby.
She works at Starbucks and her bangs look horrible. All I need to know is right there.
That shit was vibe coded.
Funny the women trying to be “safe” are the ones endangering the safety of the men they dox.
How is an app that's gender exclusive even legal? How is it legal to share other people's private information without their consent to unknown amounts of strangers? How would they know some crazy stalker doesn't get on there to stalk their exes?
Gross looking womenn my god
Always the ugly ones have to complain about shit
Damn. Maybe they should have paid men to code it 😂
Someone wants to make bear spill app for guys?
They are mad because they got a taste of their own medicine.  LOl
Got caught🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How did they know i was 'someone nasty' ?
Nothing needs to be "hacked" when its written in an public storage...
Ladies, assuming you're even here, what was the issue with doing a criminal background check on the guy? 😕
At 0:55 (it was the dam farm animals.) If you know your know
The doxxers have become the doxxees 😂 Cry me a river
Its okay if it happens to men but if it happens to women oh no
I swear, every time something truly egregious happens like this, the storyline starts with "So 4Chan instantly gained access and tore it apart."  It's amazing.
LoL whats the site?
No it’s slightly wrong, it wasn’t mandatory to use Id  cards any photos would work, they just were that dumb XD
the women from Tea app "this isn't right they can't just leak our data like that!"....Tesla owners "first time?"
Forget these women. Find these hair stylists letting them walk out with these cuts. That’s crimes against humanity.
if men did this, these exact people would be up in arms. the irony is crazy.
This world is beyond fucked
Wow, what a complete and utter mess these modern women have become.
4 chan for the win!!!!!
“I knew it”😂
Based on there pictures the 4B movement is there only option regardless.😂
2:00 literal 5 foot 3 and an attitude 😂😂
Top 50 are average to cute. Bottom 50 belong in zoos.
1:14 bruh, she knows she’s deterring men without even trying simply with her aesthetics.
The issue is I don't even believe the app was doing what it was supposed to. Many of the men targeted by the app seem really good looking and there's no way they were dating the women on the app. I suspect the app was actually just used as a way to dox men who were either successful, good looking or men who held differing political views to them. This wasn't about keeping women safe in the sexual sense but rather trying to make everyone as miserable as they are.
if your dumb, you gotta be tough
dam
Bitter, ugly, vindictive chicks got doxxed while doxxing men? Probably Trump’s fault, of course.
NONE of those women "Have Good Genes"! 🤮🧟‍♀️💩
EVERY SINGLE ONE LIBERAL YIKES
i’m not sure if this is a fact or not, i heard the app was designed by ai 😂
Maybe protect the database with an actual backend? Jeez.
Every day I go. Oh my fucking god Schopenhauer was right, and now that men don't seek out women like before it's all falling apart
Glory to the 4Chan hackers. Thank you for your service
😂😂 more than half the internet is naked women having fun. What is she on about
Nose ring girl looks like a character from Diablo.
They look exactly like I thought they would. 😅😅😅😂
HAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA    .....     Karma.
Well maybe if the fucking idiots had actual security measures in place 😂
Absolutely love this. 😂
*just wanna shout out all the true dawgs over at 4chan*  Never have been on that site, but they did something pretty great here
"Somebody nasty was able to access all that information." Yes. That was the point of the app. 100% of the intended userbase was "somebody nasty."
What's up with that haircut! 😵‍💫 You just know she did it herself!😜😆😂🤣
Isn't doxing a federal crime and doesn't this app do nothing but dox men
Seriously is that a wig?
bet the security was programmed by a woman
It's always the uglies causing the most problems...
In sparring, theres a saying. “Dont hit harder than you’re willing to be hit” Naturally this concept alludes many women since for centuries, they were/are untouchable.  Seems to me though, this app is pure malice and what they got was exactly what they dished out.
Ladies had the height filter. Finally we get the weight filter
If you can't have fun without doxxing other people and making accusations without evidence Maybe u don't deserve internet😂
If you think you need more security to keep yourself anonymous when doing bad things, maybe you should just not do bad things, and you won’t get caught doing bad things
I can't unsee her haircut.
Jesus, these women are gross. Why would anyone think it's okay to use a doxxing and shaming app?
100 women vs 1 accountability
Believing anything on the internet is secure... Foids in 2025, hahaha,
I knew you knew it. 😂
I am so unbelievably shocked that each and every one of these women are completely disgusting looking and horrible. Okay maybe not that shocked.
Jabba the huts dating site?
In my state, I'm pretty positive out licenses don't have our weights on them.
How can you find the leaks? Starting to think it didn't happen lol
I swear it's gonna be 4chan that leaks the Epstein list
ID in the US have weight information?
You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but you absolutely can judge a person by the glasses they wear.
Rule 1: NOTHING is secure
Why is it that both women in the video talking about it have the same haircut 😂😂😂
Hey this was funny, but why the jump scare at the end?😱
So it’s an app for 2s and 3s?
Never trust any lady with bangs that short. Neva eva.
Of course it was 4chan 😂 Based
theres women in the list DOUBLE my weight??????
The uglys at ot again.
0:58 ELO lmao
So you had a U.S dept of Defense employee, upload their gov ID to a dating site? Are you jokin?
Everyone had acces to the datas you just had to click a url in the edit tab
Uploading your DOD ID to an app that any middle schooler can tell isn’t secure is the icing on the cake!!🤣🤣🤌🏽
Are there even ANY hot chicks on there?
They all look fatherless
Dudes made an app to gather all the crazies in one large Index and then it got "leaked". Mission accomplished.
Honestly an app like that but working "ideally" fine, could be good.... Nah they'll still date criminals over good men and complain 🤣🤣
Not surprised that’s what the women look like 😂
was not expecting to hear Helldivers music
This is a great example of the future if the "child protection" laws go through. Everyone will get doxxed.
They look *exactly* how we all imagined
Reverse the genders and see how quickly that app burns to the ground lmao
A woman probably helped leak it too that’s the real kicker
How is there no legal case on both sides? Like first of all sharing personal data of a stranger sounds very illegal and then the data leak itself while morally yes you deserve it but like how is there no legal case?
Wow,Tina from bobs burgers got old and mean.
Not all heroes wear capes
Ah, right, I forgot I was in the year 2025 where and not 1775 where everything wasn't on the internet.
Jew media calling it a woMens safe dating app is WILD🤣🤣🤣
Just look at all those fridges
All lying about their weight, height, income, intentions, and probably lying about most of the men they post too.
......accountability what?!? These women are all just plain dumb
Some notes: no the app wasn’t hack, it was legit public domain that if ypu just had the correct url you can gain access to all of the app’s data shown in the leak, they want to push the “hacked” narrative to alleviate the pressue on the app developer onto the 4chan users, saying they caused it, and not the stupid dev who decided to put all the photos onto a public bucket
Rename the app 'Fugly Teapots' and laugh at how the turn tables.
Kinda funny the MGTOW stuff gets perma-banned everywhere it pops up but this shit that’s the female equivalent flourishes lol well well well hypocrisy is alive and well
The abrupt endings always catch me out guard. He’ll just be in the middle of insulting some people and then it’s just over. Come on brother get a fucking outro or something lol
1:35 “enough security measures”? There were literally none. It was a public S3 bucket anyone could browse.
Bro what is that haircut and glasses 😂
Karma sucks chunguses
1:48 "I'm watching you, Wazowski. Aaalwaaays waaatching..."
95% percent of them aren’t even in the guys doxxed radar. In other words, a lot of the comments and red flags was likely women like these or from women that are as ugly inside as the ones was saw are outside.
They look just the way I imagined it
Librarian pointed glasses, bowl cut, hunched over, with a resting b—— face….Hallmark look of a feminist.
Guys shouldake an app to track Gardening Equipment 😂😂😂
Those hideous creatures never dated anyone, just spread lies 😂
There should be a skip button on those girl v girl pictures.
Are ANY of the users in that app even “In the Dark” attractive?
0:18 - 1:05 is that the Super Earth anthem...
If she bangs (hair cut) she <insert punchline>
That's what you get when you vibe code lol.
Only safe game will be the simulators., no!!!!!
Yeah its only okay when women do it.. NOT!
I went to HS with the chick at 1:28 lmao
I can recognize their smell from the screen and damn I bet chicken nuggets smells better
I’m of 2 minds on this. On the one hand, they were putting likely normal guy’s on blast. On the other hand, 2 wrongs don’t make a right.
They totally fit the stereotype lols
LoL this is hilarious 🤣
the girl looks like she belongs in some Key & Peele skits LMAO.
This whole development is just to perfect.  These horrible women deserve everything coming there way now.  You are inferior.  You'll be lucky with whatever we LET you keep going forward.  You keep vilifying us and now we just don't give a shit.  You shouldn't have been so disrespectful to men.
Girl version of Ashley Madison lol
the app devs are probably going to be facing a massive class action, and yes, they do have a legal responsibility to secure data they collect. Also DoD employees arent allowed to submit pictures of their DoD IDs for things like this
So a bunch of TORTAS wants to dox dudes as they see fit on a woman only app. But they got doxed themselves.  😂😂😂
Were these women even seriously getting dates to begin with? Something makes me suspect they were just making stuff up about people they hated.
"Shea Le Buff" 4-chan moment right here.....
Let’s gooooo based hackers man haha
They got it wrong tho...they're safe...now that we know where they are, we can avoid them. 🎉
What is love, baby don't hurt me
Your generation refused to learn and are suffering from not knowing history. They have failed due to a lack of education and intelligence. Brain dead bums won't study or learn
What is that hairline
The Tea App - corn meal for clucking hens.
ANYONE GONNA TALK BOUT THE HELLDIVERS 2 "SUPER EARTH ANTHEM" PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND
when they said there are whales in every shore, i didnt think id see a pod of them
Imagine in the future, we have name tags htat float above our heads and next to the name it says your age, gender, relationship status, if you have OF, if you have tea app etc  Basically all of their potential red flags hovering over their heads, so you know who to avoid
She has got the most horrendous haircut on a woman I think I have ever seen!
Modern women are vile avoid them at all costs
“Nobody’s allowed to have a fun time” Fun time=ruining men’s lives
I have not seen one attractive woman complaining about this.
There is zero chance that Birth Control Glasses Girl has ever had an honest encounter with a man.  Other than making his coffee.
women taking accountability is impossible
none of them need to worry lol
That's some super funny shit.
1:48 that is a potato with a wig, googly eyes, and glasses. I REFUSE to believe that's a person.
1:32 what do we even say at this point about these individuals. God bless them I guess😅
Where can I play the game already?
incels are involuntary celibate. the key term being involuntary. i doubt very much that Asmon could not get a girl if that was a goal for him. he sounds more like a volcel voluntary celibate or because in the original definition it is voluntary is part of the definition of celibate he is just a cel.
The one with the septum piercing has an Adam’s apple. How did “she” get that?
classifying malicious gossip and doxxing of random unconsenting men as "fun"  just classifies you as evil, sorry, what do they say? "be better" I'm amazed that the supposed empathic gender does not stop to think what they would feel if men were doing this to them and if they had a similar kind of app where men gossip and share pictures of whomever they're dating
What idiot hmm let me see what Id should I use to sign up for an app. My divers license no my government employment Id yes.
I know the girl In the thumbnail that's so wild 😂
I literally had just heard about this thing so I don't really understand what is even going on here. So it's a fake dating app aimed at exposing men? Exposing them doing what? Is that what it is I still actually don't understand what the hell's going on here😂
LMAO. The women on that app look EXACTLY how i imagine they would.
BOCWFOCWs?!
WHAT LEACKS, IT THAT PICS ABOUT SUAGE SPILLS???  LOOL :)
Women not realizing the hypocrisy of them being toxic while calling men toxic.
Dude. Why TF is the curtain bang haircut a dead giveaway for a pyschopath
bahahaha🤣🤣🤣
Teaspill game is fake and just promotes an AI. The game is fake and the images I am pretty sure are fake too. If you look into their images directory on the site there are only 100 images in whole on their site to vote on. They just pick random 2 next to each other.
I hear the Helldivers Super Earth Anthem in the background
the word "incel" is a massive red flag. the only people who use it are incels themselves who clearly don't understand the meaning of the word.
Define Nasty...
So. Many. Snot. Rings.
Doxxing people online, yea mucho fun.  Rating the Tea App leaked photos , which all look like a collection of draugr mug shots from Skyrim, has been hilariously entertaining.
The Internet broke women.
Create app to leak personal information on men Women most affected
the glasses?..... bro that HAIR! WTF?
And they wonder why men want nothing to do with them 👏
Damn - some scary good coders out there. Hacked that shit in no time.
Anyone with hair like that doesn't want you to have fun.
Should be arrested for that haircut
So a group of people who were publicizing and posting others' personal information and pictures is upset that other people have posted their image and information?!?!?!
Imagine needing an app or the internet to find a women lmfao
the hairline the glasses and the piercings, that's 3 strikes boys
People say beating is bad? Why?
1:36 Said by someone who was nasty first, lol.
"no one can have fun on the Internet" isn't this app in theory about sharing warnings and red flags with other women? Yet she describes it as "having fun" that's really all you need to know. This was never about safety but about defaming and destroying men "for fun"
These women are on Tiktok and Tea cause nobody else wants anything to do with them.
best pic ive seen of the lot was that chicken nugget picture. easily take it over any of them.
"No one can have fun time on the internet", I am, this shit is hilarious.
1:02 helldivers national anthem 😂😂
I'm finally starting to understand that haircut... it's entire point is to repel men. Don't think I've ever seen any guy date one of those.
its wild that you can tell someones entire ideology by whether or not the have a septum ring or not.
they should fear us
Women ☕
Septum Piercing = Invalid Opinion.
For Super Earth 🫡 🌎
Motherfucker are you playing the helldiver's theme over the narrator voice?
Women don't understand they are also capable of being involuntarily celibate.
Oh no! It's the consequences of my actions!
The ultimate justice for the unbridled nature of some women and the world they supported, is to have a son. Especially one they love, who faces constant rejection and humiliation from women like the mother. Especially because of rumors.   The downside is that it only takes one idiot friend in a group to dive into each partner's life. It's weird but just like every other unproductive hobby, it scratches an itch inside them. Some people are addicted to anger, frustration, and revenge. Some people like pain, inflicting pain, even when it's unfair. Inflicting unfair pain is even more satisfying for some people.    To speak poorly about people who can't defend themselves has them getting off on the idea of revenge. Some strippers dance not to entertain, but to take. To swindle men out of money not because these men are "bad", but because they were once hurt by someone who will never be their customer. It's a cycle that has more consequences for their family. My #1 hope is for each woman to have a son and either A. Learn to love and accept people with flaws. They give their besties free passes all the time while shaming randoms. B. Bear witness to the unwanted son who gets made fun of by every woman he has a crush on because their single parent household couldn't teach them enough to be a man. Women teach what they think they want, not what they need or crave. They teach to be nice, giving, everything they thought was missing from the aholes that impregnated them. That they were attracted to ~ raise a son, my dear.
Wait! So you telling me, now we know info about them, to avoid them 🤣🤣🤣
All the ugly ones 🤣
Women...
I knew this app would be ashley madison 2.0. Got me a list of people not to take out on a date. Go read reviews from incompatible people, please, be my guest 😂
Show more leaks. Every single one should be broadcast. This is more important than the Epstein files
Lmao get wrecked
You know who wrote the app? A woman. That's DEI programming for you.
Hahaha,this is gold. Fugly, fugly, fugly, I mean when you pictured who would use that app you weren't wrong.
This whole thing just confirmed what many men already knew.
I invested heavily in popcorn this week.
Legit female incels. Also in Europe this would have been illegal from the start because of gdpr.
Hello from the grave. Celebrating, little tired from all the winning ;). Good luck, Asmon. Had just some Seitan-Döner and sweet potatoe fries with vegan mayonnaise and salsa. Just amazing! ;) Hope to see you soon.
Oh my, it’s all the democrat women in one space. BMI is off the charts
It was never intended to "keep women safe" It was just a platform for them to run guys names through the mud, call them cheaters, and gossip (while the creator farms everyone's personal information and sells it off). It's even called Tea, lmao 🤣🤣
Are we not going to talk about her hair
So disgusting
These aren't women, they are aswang
It's not just the glasses. It's also the short bangs.
1:39 the look of all the woman says everything
Oh, the irony...
Whats funny is how they want a selfie to verify if you're a woman, but what if you're a mtf trans and they say no? So are they homophobic 😂💀
Calling this a hacking is like calling me picking up a wallet someone dropped “by accident” mugging.  It’s an app made by a bunch of DEI aspirants who wouldn’t take criticism if it came with vegan snacks and a cake baked by their own grandma, so they never learned what goes into releasing a product that’s GDPL compliant
The irony of her accusing the detractors of being incels while defending a femcel app is hilarious 😂
Holy mother of Chewbacca, what are those incredible ugly and disgusting things? I refuse to believe they are humans.
There is no scarier force than forchan hackers. We need them for the epstien files.
Ugly elo is insane 😂😂😂😂
Sweet, sweet karma.
5'3 and 190LBSSSSS!!!!!!???? LMAO
Lol literally anyone with the right link would have had access to this "leak" it was less secure than your personal email address
why, if you are ugly, you want to be vomit inducing ugly?
This reminds me of a meme regarding a pedal bike and self inflicted crash...
"having fun" = destroying other people's lives from secrecy..... UNO reverse card initiated!
Thank goodness they included the location data in the leak… now I know exactly where to go for whale-watching 🐳
God damn that girl looks like the fucking hob goblin
Men look at the map, you'll want to do all of your dating in that one small gap in Utah.
"Noone can have a fun time on the internet anymore"  These people insert themselves into every nook and cranny, just to make men miserable.
hahahah!
I'm a woman and I have fun on the Internet, I have no clue what she's talking about
Ah, it would seem that the turns have indeed tabled.
The glasses are so bad. But the hair …
Remember psites have people uploading their ids to view that.. due to government law
That thumbnail is FUCKIN' WILD!
Typical nazis left: it okay when they do it.
A bunch of women refusing to take accountabillity for their actions - :/youdontsayMEME\:
Can't wait for Ai-RObot women
How is the TEA App legal?
Look at these women. You can tell they voted for Harris.
so a bunch of ugly chicks banded together to make the one true app of the land where they could get info about guys who wouldn’t even go out with them just for it to backfire take all there info turn into a game showing all the ugly women judging guys thats the most wild thing i’ve heard in a while
Yeah so.. I'm gonna make the coffee dating advice app for men where we post full pictures of potential future cat women that men have had the unfortunate experience of wasting their time and money with. We can post all their information, full names, street address, whatever they have in the tea app I don't wanna think too much outside the box and let's see how long until I get a civil suit to forcibly remove it or it just getting banned all together
The Glasses? It's the bangs AND glasses for me.
You can't show these profile pictures without advising people first. My eyes.
Oh, look. Microbangs. I wonder if she'll have the most cooked opinion humanly possible.
wild take. tons of public websites over the years doxxing women, many of them exposing nude images/videos or rating womens nude photos, and many years later a website that is doxxing men but for purposes of dating, not releasing nudes, and now lots of men yelling about hypocrisy  bros. you have moms, girlfriends, sisters, aunts. maybe ask them how they feel about men. fucking weirdos
Women make a website to black list and “expose” men. Then they cry and bitch when THEY are black listed and exposed. Lol
It's as if the devs designed the app to gather sensitive data, ignored purposefully security measures and were the ones to ignite the leak so that everyone can now know which people are the ones to be avoided at all cost. Ingenious! Thanks everyone involved for this service to the society.
That hair cut she gave herself, wtf is it I'm confused why people want that beatle juice cut?
Those faces make vibrators self destruct.
Where is the tea spill game. I want to play haha
Karma bitches
They don't want to date these men and the men are thankful for it. Didn't even need to do anything.
After the first "thing" appeared on the screen, I just turned off my monitor. It's 3:30 in the morning, and I don't want to have nightmares about Lovecraftian monsters that walk among us.
if it was being used to track people who were sex pests, i genuinely wouldn't have cared at all.   Sure, im sure there was some actually good information from some of the girls on the app, but i guarantee you 99% of it was "oh well he ghosted me" or "he's cute but he makes no money" or the like lmfao
😂😂😂😂😂
Why are they leaking a list of whale species?
They’re mad that the tea spilled on the tea app? Ohhh how ironic lolol
Cap no way that creature dates men
Microbangs, mega glasses and septum. These girls all look so tired.
One second...lemme go grab my tiny violin
4 chan for the win 🍵 ☕️ 🫖 🧋 🍵 😅
To the 4chan users out there we salute you 🫡  Thank you for your service
She ain't a lady if she ain't 280. Where can I find these ladies?
Maybe if the landwhales and blue hairs on that app weren't a bunch of hateful bigots hell bent on repressing men and removing them from society this wouldn't have happened.  Same women upset about this would be cheering of the exact same thing happened to an Alpha Male Red Pill app for Andrew TTe fans.  Note how they blame everything on the app, and the people that put the info out there while doing any and all accountibility for their own behavior as individual users of the app...Maybe don't be hateful banshees and you won't have to worry about it?
Woman ☕
4Chan out there doin' God's work.
Don't worry. New app for women are coming. It is called DRAMA APP, where you can invent stories about men and only thing you need is to prove that you are feminist and hate men.
I sorry, who were the "nasty" ones?  The women that were secretly talking shit about men they dated, sharing the men's private info without a care, or the people that let out all gossiping biatch's private info for all the world to see?  I think we know the answer.
Doxxing the doxxers, seems fair.
HEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAAAAAAA 😹👆
The real tea is all the fugs.
What do you even ask the barber for when you get a a haircut that bad?
broooooooo what is that cut man?
they call us incels but they are the ones making defamation claims the irony
America land of hypocrisy
Hmm hmm, seems like a bunch of buck fuckets that got butt hurt that that dude from tinder did buck their fucket
I guess 4chan isn't completely lost yet.
Not the Super Earth anthem during the explanation lol
Im in my late 20’s tryna find my queen and Some1 told me “it pays to be single now” 😂😂 idk what to think anymore other than “we’re absolutely cooked”
why do americans always struggle with the words coordinates and "turret" the amount of time i've heard americans call the turrets on league of legends "turrents" is unreal
First of all, lets call the app what it is. Men bashing! Secondly, we know all women lie, especially the big whales that are bitter that men won't call them a ten and pay all their bills for them and thirdly, anyone who has any brains will understand that they are trolls that have no life except being a keyboard warrior.
Who on earth cut that woman's hair?
Next up "did they use tea app" app
that fringe is trouble
wtf, bringing grenades into the fight?
did anyone else hear the helldiver anthem at 1:01
IT war against men? Are these ladies for real?
Who told her those bangs look good. Not a man, that’s for sure.
Glasse are gaiiiiii
Well if you ask me this app is more for me to laugh at how many men actually went out, let alone just talk to these women.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No bangs, Karen glasses and a barista apron. It's like a when frog or snake has bright colors to show everyone that it's poisonous.
That's a handy list of all the crazies and the giant lards. XD
4chan, delete that app and others like it!
Wtf is with womens bangs these days? That shit does not look good
I can't get my head around "4chan's intelligentsia” 😅
Hog App.
Guys should have a crazy list. Bet most of these women would make the list. Delusionals.
The Leaking's Will Continue Until Morality Improves
Love how in these leaked photos, you can tell that the majority of these women are unhappy and have the victim mentality.
Get rekt scrubs
Should've read them tea leaves...
..and best yet all of these disgusting, vile, wretched, pukes of human women are 100% Democrats.
No one ever heard the term "turn about is fair game."?
WTF IS WITH THAT HAIR???
Can trans men use the app.
Wtf are those bangs.
That app is a horrible idea. Idk if anyone ever told you this, but women lie. A lot. I guarantee there are men's photos on that app that are only there because they rejected one of these...I guess we're calling them women?
This is such chronically online social issue. On one hand you have the Asmon-type incel bros and the other, fem-Dem psycho girls.  Both of you need to go out in the world, touch grass, and stay off the net for awhile.
Do these things even have functioning brains? They act like automatons regurgitating what their overlords tell them to with not a single thought of their own or any thought for that matter.
0:06 No one is trying  to stop you from having fun on the internet. Download an online video game and go have fun.
I remember in school, if you made a girls' tier list, the parents of everyone involved, including the girls on the tier list, were called. Afterwards, you would be embarrassed in front of a large crowd and would be told to apologize to every girl on the list.
That's Free Palestine haircut says it all
Yo, where would someone go to check up on your own info on that site? So I can avoid going there.
I'm actually starting to wonder if this app was designed and created by a secret manosphere sympathizer specifically to allow the toxic doxers to be doxed.
What did you see ? ….. GOZILLA GOZILLA GOZILLA
That chick pulls no muff.
This app should’ve been tested by trans women.   Ultimate checkmate tbh
Not the vegan hair
The funniest part is when they claim the app was meant to prevent people going out with felons. Bish, you actively seek out the felons and other "bad boys" to go out with them.
Those bangs are the reddest of red flags.
All the women at the end of the video look the same
Those females are NOT ladies
What a horrible and immoral app. Indeed, how can this be legal?
One last short before bed to get terrified at the end
Fucking helldivers patriot song In the back ground. That's funny
They belong in prison for making that app.
Wait so are they transphobic? How does a government ID determine gender accurately now?😂 according to their logic
Doxers getting doxxed and crying about it online. Yeah almost like doxxing people is shit behavior and you should expect to be treated how you treat others or something 😂
There it is!  I knew it!😂
Nice glasses and bangs. She's missing out on a big, nasty nose ring. She could make herself look at least 10% more ugly
their appearance explains their politics 😮
But it's about abusers. Abusive men..
They managed to make it even worse for them, somehow... Oh who am I kidding, we all know there's no end to the worst ☕️
Those glasses and that hair are a great deterrent.
Intentionally expose people's data and personal info without their permission?  Perfectly fine. Experience the exact same thing happening to yourself?  I'm a victim.
I have a hard time believing those things dated ANY men.
What do we learn? Never. EVER. Mess with 4chan's people.
Whatttttt? Karma is a b*tch? Who would have thought.
NO FUCKING WAY IT TELLS YOU IF THEYRE A CHUNGUS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dont throw stones if you live in a glass house… and these ladies homes have paper thin walls.
1:45 I can't XDDD I just can't XDDD
I avoid those haircuts. Jesus she should get a refund, it's so bad it's hilarious.
The women who say incels always look like this.  It's always the chicks nobody wants to touch unless you're in need of a slumpbuster.
Pony boy got a better haircut from a switchblade
Why are all these people so yucky looking?
Why does she have a peoblem with the leakers? Geeze, sone people just hate others having fun on the internet huh
ahh the usual suspects 😂
have to have an id to use an app, but still vote without it
Why do all of them look like demons
who the fuck would want to date that woman? that fucking hair cut and eyeglass combo looks horrible
Good lord, if there ever was a female incel lol!
That girl looks like Chit “Do it lady!”
90% of users is a landwhale lol
So the app that was create to dox people got their users doxed.  Oh no!  I feel so bad for them!
If you're upset about being treated the way you treat others, maybe, just maybe.... you might be the problem....
Its so funny though like we think the other gender is a piece of shizz but in reality we all are peices of shizz
Those glasses and that haircut. These women really don't have to worry about men harassing them.
"no one can have a fun time on the internet."  funny how that goes.
They can walk on land now??
"imagine thinking that illegally sharing personal information of people is just fun"
Mortallllll Teabags
Ogres my lord
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Bravo, 4chan!
PERFECT, bless the human who made this
I love the casual Helldivers 2 music in the background.
Its like poetry...
Oh so now you're cheering for 4chan?
With that hairstyle calling me an incel i take that as a god dam complement lmaooooooooooo she needs to go to a pro hair salon and stop letting her mom cut her hair she is a grown ass woman lolllll
None of them dated Men ever
They should add weight stat to dating apps! Its lijke height for men. So lets also discriminate.
the average weight of that app is 200 lb.... Need I say more?
With the stats shown at the end, I highly doubt these women dated ANY men...except maybe Colonel Sanders.
So some loser guy with self asteem issues and who can't control their own dick was butt hurt and decided to take it out on woman. These woman were just trying to stay safe. Cool. I swear, we need to do better
Imagine the brightness of a quasar that would result if such an app were to spread among men)
Why is there helldiver music in the background
It’s also Tea’s fault for not deleting the info like they said they would.
You're making fun of a website in which women went on to too feel safe. It was an app made because women get fucking killed by men on a daily basis, and it was their way to weed out and share information about men with past criminal offenses, be that DV or SA, or the fact that he was just a big red flag/incel. They weren't doxxing the men, they were just sharing information between themselves, and quite honestly if men actually behaved like decent human beings you wouldn't need a platform like that. I'm sorry but the men who are laughing at this, are the same men who's profile would show up on those websites, and that includes yours Asmon. 😐
Ah yes someone nasty accessed the app. Like that wasnt the case before.
Perfect example of the extreme leftist..."It's ok when WE do it, but you have to be ostracized from public life and not allowed to hold a job."
notice its the ugly ones complaining
Did no one else remember the app Lulu?
the 4B Femcells doxing the men they somehow conned into dates are big mad they all got exposed.
The fact this went as long as it did without immediately getting sued off the internet is a mystery. Because it's breaking SO MANY privacy laws.
I feel really bad for what their cats are about to endure.
Imagine women saying that they aren't allowed to have fun online because they were caught doxxing and making fun of men and then playing the victim because people found out about their "fun."
I've never met a woman [ including my mother ] that once you really get to know her, not just at work etc, you could honestly LABEL as a lady. They constantly label themselves as ladies, but that just another lie. So please consider stopping it unless you really do know it's not a lie.
Lmao this is karma at its finest!
"the shorter the bangs the less likely a man would be to approach me"
How is it legal in the first place
Always ask yourself “ladies” that if men or another group did it, how would you feel? Bad, disgusted, violated? Then I guess you shouldn’t have done it. It’s no wonder someone hacked it…
4chan didn't leak it.  They found it.
Proof alien exist😂.
Creating an app to doxx and slander every man that has ever told them "No." Because goodness forbid that a man has the right to choose the woman he wants to date like a woman has the right to choose the man she wants to date. They hate reciprocity. That's why they have double standards.  You know what really burns a woman? The thought that you enjoyed her just as much as she enjoyed you.
They can't even keep their story straight. Right after saying that she was having "fun" on the app she suddenly claims the app was all about women's safety.
My question is why these girls all have hairlines like a fucking 60 year old man
Now everyone knows where are you living ladies.
elo ranking LOL IMAGINE HAVING A PRO LEADERBOARD FOR HATING
Funny thing, this video finished and I got an advert for Tena lady, girly pads, hhmm, trying to tell me something me thinks.
I'm waiting to see weight in double digits
Rare W moment for data leakers. They basically hit the uno reverse on that entire app and all its users.
Fat disgusting women  Im super sure they arent ALL liberal trash...  ...
Personally thanking the 4-chan masters of code for their primo efforts. Excellent work. It is good and well that someone has done it. Had no idea they had a nasty hate network abusing men for their own secret group pleasures. Shame shame.
Ooohhhhhhh so NOW she calls herself a woman.
wait? for real? man, TF is going on with the States Allowing this to happen, afaik, doxxing is a crime and should be punishable by jail.
they all gender swap and weight swap asmon.
The usual suspects tend to look like the usual suspects. Go figure.
😂 there's no way in Hades that any of the 'women' shown have ever been asked on a date!! 😅 They're just men haters...the haircut says it all 🤣 ... nice try ladies
this poetic irony got me believing in god and shit
The haircut the glasses the nose rings
It's funny how the women look like the penguin from batman returns judging men completely out of their league... If this is the other way around my God you can imagine the chaos..
GG
1:10 1:27 the haircut say it all
App that’s designed for revealing personal data, leaked personal data? WOW that was unexpected 😂
She's trying to create a social credit system based on women's opinions. That is the literally opposite of a fair trial
seems like karma....
Where do I collect my 200Ib prize?
🤣😂 and its all mids and uggos!
Could you imagine the unhinged outcry if Men made a website like this? 😂😂😂
Used to like your content Asmon, but you're now just a incel redneck :/ maybe you'll grow up someday
it also is used to warn other women of abusive men and help them get out of a relationship before they find out the hard way. i’m by no means a feminist or anything but also my girlfriend has the app and i’ve seen her go on it a lot. obviously there are sometimes liars and ogre blobs who want to hate on men but it’s also a genuine resource for women to stay safe.
"Fun time on the internet" Doxing people and just trashing people without their knowledge or consent is the fun time? And thinking that is wrong makes you an 'incel'? The eff?
You guys have the weight on your ID? I bet some people would need to get it reissued every 10 all-you-can-eat feasts
I just can't get over the fact that the company uploaded the private information to a publicly accessible folder.
Well now I wanna know who the men were that got put in there
Why does her hair look like the basic hair from 2006 LEGO-CITY set?
Once again 4chan proves how degenerate society has become by doing the right thing just to rebel against the system.  I miss when 4chan was the degenerates and the internet was mostly decent...
Bahahahahahahaha!!!!!
Stuff like this does make you consider that karma or some sort of higher power does exist
Heres a great example of accountability. The hogs are running feral
Let’s make an app to Dox men but when they get doxxed it’s bad. Typical female logic.
Hypocrits, hypocrits everywhere.
Hahahaha get rekt
2025 Facemash be like:
Like, I get why they made the app, not so sure about the intent however. But the app never should have been made. Men aren't the only gender that is prone to lying about and defaming someone. This app was destined to cause trouble. Unfortunately those whom had good intent on using the app have to suffer the consequences. If men were to have an equivalent app (idk if 1 already exists or not as I don't do dating apps) then the same scenarios that happened on Tea would have happened to them . Bottom line is yes, there are a lot of crappy people out there. Regardless of the intent of the app, setting it up so you have to prove your gender only set them up to be targeted. All this drama and controversy is on the apps creators and management team. Don't go blaming any gender on it. If the devs cared at all, they would have found a better way to keep everyone safe instead of making a gossip cafe that purs all visitors identities in a box and throws it on the curb and forgets about it. But maybe something good could come of all this. Maybe theres a chance those that are trying to force everyone to privide identification to access anything on the internet will get a huge pushback so we all don't have to put our orivacy and safety at risk just to watch YouTube or talk to friends
So its a femcel app? Got it...
🍿🍿🍿
On the About page of tea "With a proven background leading product development teams at top Bay Area tech companies like Salesforce and Shutterfly, Sean leveraged his expertise building innovative technology to create a game-changing platform that orioritizes women's safety" Good job listing who made this shit site/service so nobody wastes their money on a shitty job. I wouldn't be surprised if these tech companies now go under because who tf is gonna hire them after this 😂
If a man made the same app about women, or if a company did that for bad employees, there would be absolute outrage and rioting. Apple would ban these apps. Google would ban these apps. But because it is libel and slander and doxing against men, it’s allowed.
Wait, you have on your ID weight? Thats wild :D
This map of TEA users proves the point that the vast majority of women are collectivists and simply go along with the herd. LOOK AT IT. See how it almost perfectly fills in the contiguous United States. There is NO male issue, cause, group, etc that would perfectly fill in a map like that. THE ONLY GAPS are in uninhabited areas.
Thats not a woman
So when do we get BeerApp for guys sharing stories and tips about women? That's in development right?
Rising gym memberships among the male population due to increased demand placed upon them regarding their ability to physically lift their potential mates into their transport devices, and then some time later into their sleeping/mating apparatuses. One ponders what kind of schlong you must possess to be able to physically penetrate the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Queens.
I like to think this was a 4D chess move by the developer to screw over bitchy women who had been mocking him for years
0:11 Those glasses were called "problem glasses" at some point. They're a quick way to identify a Karen.
Holy hell brothers, crisis adverted....
Now they have no choice but to take the bear😂
I don't even understand how the Tea Ap was and is legal? Everything about it is so dystopian, like to basically label categorize and trying to socially shame men. If the tables were turned, 100% women would be crying foul immediately, but its ok to treat men like trash as usual. Luckily 99% of Tea Apps users are literal swing and whales so no loss.
And they wonder we won't approach them
Hahaha anyone wearing these glasses doesnt want you to have fun…or freedom…or rights…well at least if youre white, straight, and believe morality is objective.
I remember when the internet was fun. Before the normies and the Karen’s could easily gain access. Ah, those were the days...
Where can i get the data dump?
All these troglodytes hate men who would have guessed 😂😂
I'm glad this could never happen in the UK, we'd never put our photo's and ID's in a database that could be compromised
Those women look exactly how I thought they would.
This is f*cking hilarious lmao
Ugly women RUIN EVERYONE ELSE'S LIFE - the ancients tried teaching us this. Ugly women will tear society down for the sin of giving them life
why do they all look like oliver tree
what's the average weight? 270 lb?
This happens because woman aren’t directly holding each other accountable face to face like guys do. You’d 100% be called out for being a fat ugly btch if you behaved like that as a guy. Equality is fine by me, but only with equal consequences.
1:51 How did Red-headed Adam Warlock in  get verified?!
dude im about tired with women. not all women.  but always, women.   i wish i were gay
What's the Tea app?
These women are just making up shit as no one is dating them anyway..... they are ugly or downright just weird freaking people where least two of them had the "don't come near me bangs" man hating haircuts. These chicks talking about men.....  a man has not been near them in decades.
I think the app itself is a trap for them 😂  No one hacked it
The unfuckables
10 bucks they all got turned-down by the exact same small group of men. Good looking, fit, over 6'2 had a career didn't date fat ugly women. They got mad and made their own club of incel rejects.
What? You're telling me that giving an app my face, ID, and other personal info is a *BAD* idea?
4 chan being the true demon ending
1. 4chan intelligence 2. Mossad 3.cia
crazy they claim they aren't safe on a site that encourages them to share personal information of other individuals without their consent.
why do these women have bangs going up to their scalps lmao
LMFAO - Weight on their ID's.
Well, the app and women should be sued by every man whose image was uploaded onto their site without permission.
Spinster App
More proof that modern feminism has, for the last 15 years, morphed from being about having equal opportunities to a culture of narcissism, revenge and man hating. Then these bitches want to complain why they can't find a "good man". Amazing.
😂9000
Bruh. That woman is the exact description of the type of woman that moans & tries their best to ruin men's happiness & she's acting as if she's little miss innocent ha
If this isn’t a prime example of “the tables have turned” I don’t know what is 🙏💀
It would be unfathomable if there was an app for just men to complain about women
No men would want to date any of these women.
We have come full circle to the original FaceMash ranking xD
The 2nd best part of this was the "Photo required for gender verification". It crashed so fast the troons didn't even get a chance to be mad. 😂
You've got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em; know when to walk away; know when to run.
Those women were 2-4 in terms of looks.  According to TeaSpill, the top 3 were at least a 6.    My wild guess, many of those women were women that men didn't find attractive enough to commit to.  Maybe smashed and passed at worst, or at best just ghosted.  Many of the women were dating the same guys (top 20% of men) in their region within the USA.
"We were just having some harmless fun doxxing men, I can't believe we would have to face a consequence as harsh as being doxxed"
Who gives a shit about this? Why do you single fucks even care about an app where only women can get on? I don’t fucking care 😂 why do you?
So proud of you anons
if they drank more actual tea, they wouldn't be so heavy and have so much acne
I can guarantee: TEA was never a part of the diet of them...
Anyone with a fringe that was cut using a ruler shouldn't be giving advice to anyone.
Petty cunbnnts
260 🤦‍♂
Honestly, I don't think any of these women have to worry about those 'evil' men. That haircut alone, giant glasses woman, will ensure that no man will want anything to do with you.
hahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahaahahahahah omg I can't stop
An app, specifically designed to hoard personal info, and it never lingered their minds why that would be such a terrible app, simply because "it gives me the fun of hurting the people i hate".
And why do all the users shown here look like cousin James? Hell maybe that’s why you attract what you attract!
4chan strikes again
I wonder how theses idiot women would feel about an app that exposes gold diggers,skanks and cheats.😂 there would be an uproar 😊
Women☕
The uglier they are..
Yeah it was totally a bunch of “incels” that leaked the info. Not a bunch of pissed off men that were being doxxed and targeted online by malicious feminists who men have zero interest in.
The Hacker Known As 4chan can't keep getting away with this
so you're telling me that the ppl that were being ugly on the inside turned out to be even uglier on the outside????? ☕🐸
Oh look it's Metoo 2.0. I guess the human race is officially doomed now.
Doxxers get doxxed.
I hope she didn't get her hair cut like that on purpose.
too good.......absolutely too good!!!
An app, of bitter exes, doxing and attacking their exes.
They all might as well have " TROLL" written on their forehead
Bunch of hogs
lol I don’t need to know anythin about these women to know to avoid em.
Obviously this is bad all the way around, from start to finish. *However* nobody MADE any of y'all put yourselves out there too participate in this disgusting behavior. Maybe you could take a good, hard look at what motivated you to send some relative stranger your government ID, and ask yourselves 'if this is what guys do when they find out we're doing this kind of thing, maybe we shouldn't be doing it if it makes them feel some type of way enough to get at the database and put all this on blast?'  Wouldn't that be a great world to live in?
Who’s gonna tell these chicks that nose rings aren’t attractive
Wait… so in this context they know what a woman is, and they expect government issued photo identification?  But voting for the president you don’t need ID because it’s racist and trans women can go in women’s spaces? The rules are subject to change at any time for any reason without notice
Kinky Boots lyrics keep getting autodeleted. Algorithm proof that Melanie copied it and it was a legit resistance song.
I'm gonna start posting these videos on tumblr just to see what happens, chances are they'll join twitter's anti asmond army 😅
All American ISPs have blocked the website where you rank the girls lol
Bruuuuuuh bruhbruh bruuuuuh you shouldn't give out your info even for job hunting let alone a fing app 🤌😂🗿
BANGS LOL
Asking for a friend, where can we play the tea spill game
disgusting fucking hogs LOL why do the majority of them have a worse hairline than me lmfao bro
Like I'd trust another woman's opinion of a man. If I want to know what a man is like, I'd ask another man.
1:35 "not enough security measures" or, you know, any security measures whatsoever
Score one for the fellas! Good job boys😂😂
I like how the data wasn’t even secure lmao
so now i guess i happen to have identifying info on more than 10k women if i ever want to move to the US. honestly thinking about not going at all, i heard too many bad things.
The ads for the app itself showed screenshots with templates for address and contact details, so people trying to argue the app wasn't literally a doxxing people is lying.
I just watched S2 Underground about this data breach, and the ladies have no idea how badly they have screwed up.
Whats with the smelly fringe haircuts??? 😂
What’s a foid?
I thought 4 chan was hacked and taken down. I didn't know it came back up.
Here's the fun part kiddos. If you can prove your private information was put onto the site by a person you did not give permission to ... lawsuit heaven. It's an easy win. Not only is it considered doxing but depending on what's said or put into the information it's also defamation.
Does she cut her own bangs?
American Ugly is on the Menu and it's not selling.
😂😂4chan intelegecia😂😂
🐷🐽🐖
Would be cool if some high IQ Chad would leak them Epstein files. Instead of this.
Women gotta learn the hard way 😂😂
bro. why does American id's have their weight listed? lol. that shit is too funny haha
that would be so intense to just have random people send crap to your house or spam your number just because of 1 random encounter
Gotta love vibe coding.
0:12 and that hair
Girls will be girls
Plot twist: The Tea app was never hacked it was all planned out by a man who wanted to expose these disgusting creatures and uploaded the leaks himself and only claimed the app was hacked.
I didn’t know that Danielle Brisebois was on that site. If you nose, you nose.
This is literally TrollTrace from South Park lmao
Fuck you for continuing to use Sir David's voice.
This isn't just a data leak, it's a national security risk thanks to all the blackmail material this app has provided. It's a shitty app for shitty people.
good
The easies way to look at it is what if the sex of the people was reversed - it was men who created a site to dox women and their personal information and how horrible they were  Women would be pressing the government to arrest every single user of the website and would be cheering the hacking. They're just pathetic hypocrites.
Passport bros just keep winning.
I'm just waiting for the day 4Chan gets bored and decides to shut down OF or TikTok for a day. I'm just saying it would be hilarious.
Once again 4chan being legendary .
4Chan doing God's work.
Those haircuts looked hostile. Nosering opened her eyes and I almost ran for the hills 😂
FAR nore concerning than the average Karens is that women on military bases using this app have produced LOADS of potential blackmail material that can be used to potentially pressure lower ranked military members into aiding our adversaries.
Who is this 4 Chan?
“Staying safe” always means having zero accountability for their actions whatsoever.
More feral hogs in that app than the whole state of Texas
Classic leftist hypocrisy. "No men allowed" but still unable to define what a woman is 😂
I am sick of this 💩.     I just want society to go back to normal.
PNZ  NVY
Oink oink 🐷
Guys theyre doing u all a favor, youll never meet these women lol
0:12 Those bangs DEAR GOD
And now we have a database full of women to avoid. Win-win.
Is it odd that many of these women are literally too big to fight (as a HEAVYWEIGHT) in the UFC?
Hoggin aint quiet no more i guess
Femcel vs Incel never gets old
GOLD
AND THIS IS WHY REAL ID ON THE INTERNET IS BAD!
Oh how the turn tables.
Women ☕️
leak info is useless those fat girl has full red flags and that info is next to useless
That Department of Defense ID was nothing more than a dependent ID card for family members of someone in the military. In the military, we call them Dependa's. They are the military spouse Karen. Dependapotumus is the XXXL version that usually preys on the 150 lb junior enlisted guy by giving him anything he wants at first but soon draining his bank account and popping out 4 kids to get a bigger house on base. They are generally found cruising around on trash night in a minivan, fighting over old furniture on the curb in the officer housing area so they can list it on Marketplace. If they're not there, they are likely running a pyramid scheme (or six) and over-breeding their dogs (likely a something-doodle) to sell the overpriced puppies and complain on Facebook when they can't get rid of them.
How is that app even legal to begin with?
🤣
Women are INSUFFERABLE because whenever they are caught being Shitty People they ALWAYS claim Victimhood!
I find it ironic they're calling men incels, yet, they were on some female only app talking a lot of shit about men behind their backs. Sounds very much like incel behavior. Damn, there seems to be a female chopped epidemic.
lol yummy
Tea app  huh What’s next called be…Wine app?
😂😂😂
When I was seven I wanted to cut my own bangs. I got some scissors and I wound up looking like these women. My mother was furious. I had to go out to a nice dinner that night looking like that and I'm still not convinced that the whole thing wasn't set up just to make me feel like an idiot for what I had done.
humans self sorting; but a certain group goes next level providing the internet with photos and statistics to cement their roles as the ugliest un-dateable women with small heart and bad attitudes. Well done 'you go girl'. Bwwhaaaaahahahaha. Old guy laughing and taking the piss .
It never stops being funny when the stars align every few years and 4chan becomes Grawp. It emerges from the forest, ignores everything except what's pissing it off and smashes it into the ground, and then wanders back into the woods until something else is dumb enough to disturb it from whatever weird shit it's otherwise doing.
the glasses and that hideous haircut lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Did she really say “ coordinants” ??????
This is hilarious =P
You think men arent going to have each others backs you silly little tw@ts? lol
The irony of them not realizing they’re complaining about what they were doing is golden
Incel is a silly word 😂
One small step back for women, a giant leap for mankind
FISK problem.
Mentioned the glasses but forgets the bangs.
these fuckers will never learn
Lol thats why I never use real i formation and I have 5 protections lol
NOne of them remempered the flpappening? It happened to Iphone cloud server. Why couldnt it happen to tea app?
Head on a swivel?  Don't join apps.
idiots should have sued the app
Tea Spilled sounds like a App that will make women think twice about doing this to men. And men are just laughing at all the woman that participated in this App. 😂😂 Wow! Talk about The Tea Wars that erupted over an app. That women thought was a safe space for them to be evil. 😂😂
They fell for the trap.
So men need the whisky app?  Flag the cat ladies for life and seal their fate.  As if they didn't seal it already themselves.
4Chan Vigilantes are still going strong even in 2025. I really thought they would have died out back in 2015. Lol
I’m tired boss…..I’m just completely fatigued in so many ways and there is no end in sight. I don’t know how much longer this can continue before I just disassociate with people entirely.
I'm sooo sick of " especially if you are a woman".  They need to go back to the 70s and then complain. Lol
It's a good idea, as an idea. But there's nothing to stop a woman from lying on it.
wait so is this like that thing 4chan did with the tea app... or did i mix that up? idk why ppl think exposing stuff = fun, like doesn’t it ruin half the vibe?? maybe i’m wrong idk
I laughed way to hard at this..
Hopefully this will humble tf outta them
The website that's hosting the comparisons between all the horror movie monsters is called TEABAG lmfao 🤣
Just waiting for the corn age verification databases to be leaked like this was.  All this stuff gets leaked. Photo verification? Just a terrible idea if you like privacy. 'Course this site didn't even encrypt things, did it? Morons.
Wouldn't it be AWESOME if it was some teenage boys who set the whole thing up from creating the app to revealing all the women.
That first person is Mandark if he had followed the Sue route.
Omg it's always the exact person you picture in your mind
Uhh... Is the video muted?  Edit: nvm yt was glitching out.
you know, me being a kissless hugless handholdless virigin guy, i dont care if they share photos of genuinely dangerous men so other women can avoid them. and maybe tell the police. but to share a guy's personal info like home addresses and shit? that is going too far.
is that damaged goods club? or simply damaged goods wannabes?
What concerns me is the data breaches that are going to happen just like this when the "Keep Kids Online Safe" law passes. Remember, they don't just want your ID or your face, but where you live and stuff. They want to know everything and not only sell it, but to keep it. So when a data breach happens for sites like Twitter and Discord and TeamSpeak, that means anyone can take your identity, use it illegally and use AI to apply it to things that will ruin your life. This is a dangerous warning and that's why the law needs to not go through. If you think the law's just about corn, you are gravely mistaken.
hot take it was a women who hacked and leaked the data, cause we all know women love to shit on each other
My thoughts on this, I don't care and never even heard of it til now.  And still, don't care.
THE INTERNET?!!?!?! YOUR LATE TO THE PARTY YOU PSYCHO LITTLE BITCH THAT WAS PROBABLY CONSIVED 10 YEARS AFTER THE FUCKING INTERNET YOU SUPID DUMB FUCK BITCH!!!
These "women" are ugly af, on the outside and inside, no wonder they use this trash of a website. GJ 4chan.
The gender war is getting intense
Another moment of “shut up” to put them in their place.
All democrat biches
Rules for Thee and NOT for ME.
Can they just be deported into a communist or socialism country because it fits their ideals? Nobody wants or wants to deal with them.
fat af lol
It's the app's fault. They made you trust them with all your man hate. 😂 I knew it. As soon as it was posted, someone wrote it with no security in mind. Easiest social engineering ever...
Imagine an app *designed to catalog certain people for subsequent targeted online harassment, bullying, ridicule, and slander* buutttt……….. someone pulls a ‘reverse uno card’ 😂
yall that was close i almolst clicked on and watched an asmongold video
I'm not convinced this app wasn't a scam from the start. I thought this was the entire goal from the start.
omg, the second woman is ever worse Jesus save us
guys you gotta have some empathy, given the pics and weights of these girls, makes really damm sense they share the info of what kind of weirdo psycho is out there hunting whales, for their security, i could understand it like... broh have some self steem what are you doing fishing in that pond? XD
Men will promise you the Earth if you let him into your box of secrets - you used to call his bluff by asking for a ring first.  Then our rulers told you to turn against your men...
Did the girl at 1:30 request for that bar to be installed crookedly?
a collection of vile women
Only women would use their real government id...
The world would be a much better place if humans accepted that theres not one kind of human anymore. Not saying evil radical stuff needs to happen, we just need to realize we are not all the same anymore. The vast sifference in intelligence between individuals alone should beg for classification. Throw in how half of us cant handle a basic sugar and how half of us are apparently born wrong, we definitely are not all homo sapiens sapiens anymore. Think we got homo sapiens sapiens sapiens and just homo(as in latin for no wisdom to be had dont make this something it isnt)
All this app was was ugly girls trying to convince hot girls to not date hot guys, but there were no hot girls on the app
Quite unfair that the women that had gotten into every gentlemen-only club/space, because not letting them in is sexist, now want separate spaces for females only, and that's not sexist towards men
“Rule for thee not for me” ah womans
1:54 I am convinced not one of these girls actually interacted with these guys.
The glasses, what about that hair cut?
1:15 I almost thought she was going to say women. Lol.
WE LET THESE KINDS OF PEOPLE VOTE!? People who refuse to take accountability for literally any problem they create? People who think the rules apply to everyone but them? If you're a sane and well adjusted individual then go ahead and vote but if you're one of these types (same goes for the dudes who do it, fair is fair) you get to sit out the next election
Apparently they don’t like the same game being played on them. It’s called Karma
The helldivers theme in the background is just peak. 10/10 editor🤣
Plot twist: tea was started by a man and this was the plan all along. 😂 would be funny.
Brothers in Christ; How are the mental acrobats defending hackers instead of supporting peoples right to social privacy.
“We cant have a fun time especially if you’re a woman”  they consider shit talking men they’ve never met based on their photos “fun” LMAO 😂
Absolutely no self awareness
They're allergic to accountability and facts
Never give your full government information to a random app. Unless it has government level security don’t trust them with government level information.
isn't discrimination based on sex illegal?
Classic trope of we can be bitter but when men are resentful, they're "incels".
Wait, it just hit me, so this app is breaking the law by not allowing men to use it, its literally a doxxing app and thats a crime. Why is there no class action suit right now! Bro, if youre a chad like myself, you should contact an attorney to have them check if youre on it and you can file liable suits both criminally and civilly.
What’s with the bangs??? Jesus
this looks like a big problem
women are so stupid lol
What's up with the Helldivers theme at 1:02 ? 🤣
Women can't create only corrupt and destroy- someone, probably.  Most men won't post their id even for porn!
imagine being so dumb you give a random app every bit of your personal information. you deserved everything youve gotten in life
This is dumb. Nobody cares.
They would lose their mind when they find out that we used to have this thing called a phone book 😂 that had all the information in there as well.
0:55  That there kids is exactly what the first version of The Facebook by Zuckerberg was!
This needs a warning to not watch anywhere near dinner time.
Judgemental femcels get judged by all.
for me as a european its a shock to see that you actually have to show your weight on your id xDD just why ?
Bunch of unattractive women who hate men
"The feminist cries out as she strikes you."
They really thought 4chan wasn’t gonna get curious. But hey, unwanted information gathering means fair game for 4chan.
Remember when parents used to tell their kids not to share personal information on the internet? There was, in fact, a reason for that.
Oh no consequences
Do these feminists always cut their bangs shorts to show off the lack of brains?
Lady has an incel hairline and thinks she has room to talk?
"This is what got leaked by the way."  Holy potatoes Batman!
So let me get this correct. The people that can't tell you what a woman is know what a man is.
Where is this map so I can avoid it
funny how theyre disgusting inside & out
>app coded by w*men >immediately compromised Who didn't see that coming?
Two hundred and sixty pounds?
lmao the ELO rankings are hilarious
Interesting that in the UK as of two days ago you now have to upload those same details to access pretty much any social media.
Pretty sure the would be illegal on the premise of doxxing and public harassment. But hey, if the victim is male, it shouldn't be a big deal right? Just like how male victims of rape or boys predated by pdfile women should not be believed as per radical feminist doctrine. The hypocrites only want the benefits of equality and none of the responsibility.
are those ladys? thay look like trogs from wow
Thank God i found my wife before all this crazy bullshit.
love the democratic music in the background
Pretty sure this app crosses some legal issues if you're going to post someones information on there, doxxing or whatever.
I'm a man who is 6ft tall and all those women weigh more than I do. lol
All these women are white & unattractive
The vast majority of women will never take accountability for any of their actions. It's always someone else's doing and never theirs.
0:11 incels..... Ok😅
when the predators become prey.
People actually CHOOSE to get frames like that...INSANE!!!
classic American leftist woman
Why would ANYONE had that hair?...
That chick has a receding hairline similar to asmons…Jesus.
"No one can have a fun time on the internet, especially if you're a woman." I'm sorry, does the average woman think doxxing men they're being a snake in the grass to gather information on is "fun?"
The app was run by a bunch of broads obviously.
260 is crazy
Ffffuggly
1:40 "Somebody nasty" If you're on this app you're nasty no if's or but's actual loser scum type behavior
Actually the haircut is a nationwide deal when you take your 🐈 to the pet groomer, they'll trim the cat's moms bangs for free, and 50% off on facial tattoos and piercings...😏✨🐈
Can we say "Honeypot?" Seems like a honeypot. Caught a bunch of feminist pooprakers.
Another reason to go to Asia beautiful women in those countries and guess what? They actually will like you!👍🏼😊
Ironically it’s very tasty “tea”
Start: "We'll make those men accountable" Finish: "Wait, what ? We can't be held accountable"
Good idea for an app terrible security though
Talk shit get hit lmao
Her idea of fun on the internet is controlling what everyone is allowed to say.
not even attack on titan can come up with designs like that damn
Why doesn't a man create the same app only for men and to keep scores of women? "Had relations with Jane on first date" "she will bleep bloop for money" things like that?
She's so safe in life that she wears a bowl on her head when she gets a haircut
this is what happen when you "vibe code" an app lol
perverts and wierdos all of them,nothing more nothing less
The app acted like it was about safety. When reality it was a hub for doxing men who ignore them. I love karma she don’t play around when it comes sad, overweight woman who blame everyone in the other gender for all thier issues. No man forced you to sit around and eat copious amounts of food. Only to attack anyone who tries holding them accountable
Cant make this shit up.  What a bunch of weirdos
Its not about any gender anything, its because they were doxing mens personal info behind their backs.
The irony of users on this red flag app ending up in a red flag database themselves.
time to make a male equivalent
1:33 Thats not even a woman, and he is crying about it. the Adam's apple alone...
Maybe Femcels do exist
Lol two broads tried to make such a chat page up here in Canada here in Regina. They got s bunch of charges. Lots of false accusations. Lol tea and other apps like that are very illegal up here.
So: Silly "women" did silly stuff.
You never see mouthy chick's coming out of the middle east..
I swear those bangs just instantly scream "mentally unstable and deranged"
DOXXER NO DOXXING!  DOXXER NO DOXXING!  Ahaaaaaaaaaaa.... Reap what you sow, you salty slugs. XDDD
"no-one can have fun on the internet"  I certainly enjoyed this whole thing
You know what's worse? Firebase buckets by default are in a locked mode, where you have to be authenticated through firebase to have read OR write access. You have to manually set it to public, and the bucket was publicly accessible.
Oh noooo , what happenned? Noooo that's terrible 😂
Just when I thought the glory days of 4Chan were behind them, they go and pull this. Respect.
The bowl cut bangs are a dead giveaway that the chick is mentally ill
Doxxing Men
anyone else catch the helldivers anthem in the background?
It’s always the ugly ones
Sounds exactly like what a bunch of snowFlake liberal women would set up. EXACTLY
Fun Fact to this lady... Nothing is secure from hackers, like LITERALLY they have gotten into government protected servers before. Anything that requires an upload of personal information, is never safe.
Well, after seeing those profile pics, it's easier to understand why the birth rates are so low.
Absolutely disgusting. Wouldnt date any of those creatures
Nice to see 4chan be based again.
Weird how menchildren with dysmorphia immediately stoop to attacking someone’s appearance when they don’t understand(agree)
this was probably a HONEYPOT done on purpose - mission accomplished
Who would predict that tea will be spilled
Feminism was established to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream.  Rush Limbaugh
never. give. your. personal. info. on. the. internet.   That's what you get for trusting a random app.
they thought they were beyond scrutiny.
Men get doxxed, women most affected
"The incels are at it again"  Oh feck off! Skip!
Who is dating this kind of woman?!?! Stop it! There are latex accessories and robots available and they don't come with the liabilities!
what? now you're taking your own medicine hurts you? fckin HIPOCRICY!!
I think that 2nd to last one was a former coworker of mine. Would be funny as hell if it is.
It's ironic that these female incels are using the word incel like it just means "guy who doesn't think women are better than men." They should probably look it up.
Kinda weird that astrology girls with crystals and little Buddhas seem totally blind to what was always going to turn into the mother of all cases of karma.
Tea was a honeypot, it's obvious. How many men do you think would fall for that sign up process? >Virtually none.
I legit thought the kind of people at the DoD would know better. Like irrespective of a girls political believes, why are you, someone that should understand and have been trained to know better, uploading personal ID to a random app?
Her hair reminds me of Legos 😂
Look at all them unfuckables.
I had to put phone next to my ear, I thought i was phantom hearing Super Earth Anthem
Nbody with that haircut is happy
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
OMG Tea spill 😂
There are also Facebook groups dedicated to this concept.
Oh unexpected reaction for internet for somebody to leaked personal infomation , what a problem...🙄🙄
No fun when the rabbit got the gun😂
it was an app built on petty behavior to begin with  they wanted to talk about men however they wanted with no rebuttal  i dont care that it failed  funny really
Hackers were the heroes we needed.
They try to make themselves unattractive on purpose
This is clusterf*** on a whole another level. I lost faith in humanity. both male and female.
Funny how they call the man incels while this is just some straight up incel type activity by some actual femcells with the Reddit mod look down weight and everything and not to mention the big ol ugly I want to speak to the manager ahh glasses on.
That's me 😊😂🤣😂
They’re too dumb to realize they are participating in a tracking system to map everyone in the US. The context if the app is a disguise for its true purpose, track and spam
A forum made for women to dox and shit talk men is upset that they got hacked and people are doxing and shit talking them.
Butt ugly people tried to be mean and got gotten. Did one hottie ever pop up. Oo they to busy getting it in.
those bangs were a choice
At least it's soulsborne characters...
That's gotta be the ugliest haircut on this planet
I love how they make it seem like hackers got it by saying "it wasn't secure enough". Brother, it was in a PUBLIC folder. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, had access to it. There was no way to make it any less secure other than to post it online yourself.
4Chan deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.
Best surprised pikachu face moment in a long time...
Someone nasty was able to get their data of woman doxing guys? wtf is wrong with this world. This app should of been taken down immediately and guys should be suing who built this app that allowed doxing of information.
Disgunsting people. 0 Accountability, is like... what were u thinnking would happen if u do stuff like that? Come on... they should all be in jail for doxxing people- hypocrisy  at it´s highest.
Boy, I sure love winning!
oof, look at that nose
ABSOULTELY NO ACCOUNTABILITY!
last one XD       Eyes: HUGE
Fuck the glasses. She has the bangs of a knights squire
Imagine an app called “mileage” and it allowed us fellas to put a tally next to a gal we squanched….. it would save us from getting a wife with a 100+ body count 😂😂
How did those ugly women know info or red flags about those men in the first place? I doubt that they used to date.
do they not understand that they are doing exactly what they are complaining about? or do they just want to be hypocrites?
I fucking Love the amazonian pottery community
could it not be very easy to spread misinformation about people without them knowing on this app?
Women fatigue is real.
Tea app leaked faster then epsteins
i guess a woman made the code too
there was an app called lulu that did thhis years ago, fkn YEAS AGO. If you think this is a new thing... you need to reseaarch. it isnt the first and definitely wont be the last.
She looks like link from GMM
Video feels very democratic lol   the music
Hahaha 🤣 the photo brought lol
Even with a filter she would look like a man, why did she do that to her hair/head?
4chan????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It should be noted: *they gained access to the information.* They did not _hack_ it, there was just no security whatsoever.
i think god exists
Super Earth National Anthem lolll
Play stupid games with win stupid prizes. 😅
Why do so many of these women have the same haircut? I mean do they just go to the hairdresser and say "can you make me look like Spock?" Lol
There hypocrisy is what's actually offensive to me. Want to make fun of how people look on the Internet? Fuckin go ahead. But I better not hear any bitching when someone does it to you. If nothing else it just demonstrates the total lack of self awareness and accountability of these women.
Rule number of the internet NEVER forget 4Chan exists
Sigh... those poor girls... this tea app is their way of crying out... listen to them folks!!! They just need more dhik...
if their 'fun' is toxic and leaking our privacy and data then i want nothin to do with them. The fk?
People like this broader and sufferable because the Internet has no bias against who it attacks   it literally will cancel or attack anybody who is insufferable or something crazy      it’s her own mind that walks around being a victim
These woman would have to travel the vastness of space to find any man
"Somebody nasty" yeah we're looking right at someone like that
that haircut is worse than asmon's
Where they want to be heroes but are just "here hoes"
Oh... irony wins, EVERYTIME!
The nose ring mafia attacking in cells  and acting like she’s the victim because she’s a woman    The funny thing is women wanna act like they’re equal, but when it comes to stuff like this all of a sudden, they’re complaining because they’re just a weak little woman
These women look exactly how I imagined
aids tea made with real aids
Omg nobody can have a fun time on the Internet, especially if you’re a woman are you kidding me?   First of all the attack on men has been going on for many years like every two seconds there’s attack on men.   However, the men don’t say anything sometimes they fight back, but they don’t whine about it and here you go. Here’s an insufferable woke person acting like a victim.   Women control, social media they dominate the Internet.   Women and cats.    She has a lot of nerve to say, especially if you’re a woman.  Let me guess even more especially if you’re a black woman.
All these beasts have something in common,  they are all  Head of HR at some Miserable Company USA,
No women in this video was attractive 😂😂😂
Internet Historian video on this would go crazy
WutFace
Of course it's the unfuckable ones
Better name for the app:  HAG
0:43 lmao
their hairstyles look worse than my hairy ass
Whats up with that haircut? Did She do it Herself?
You poor americans, everything is designed to make you single and childless.
While I understand some womens urge to warn eachother about redflag men, this is not the way to do it Karen.
☕️ ☕️ ☕️ ☕️
4chan is so fking goated for this.
Accountability is the woman's kryptonite lol
I'm glad I dated in the 90's and 2000's.  What is this shit?  (Aside from it being funny as hell it got leaked)
Every once on a red moon, it'll be said: W 4Chan.
How do we get this "leak" to be put back 😂😂
is that a woman???
They just keep doing it to themselves bro. All this liberal crap is just the bicycle meme from WAY back. Where the kid trips himself and then blames something else. 🤔
Proceeds to sip tea cheers lads
Shouldda been called the The Whale App based on those ID weight figures.
Don't listen to any woman with excessive  vocal fry.
After seeing these "women" I'm also starting to wonder "what is a woman"?
I cant find the app tea spill that you showed. Does it really exist?
I love 4chan so much. Always fighting the good fight. Maybe not always.
Lord Farquad has a dumb opinion, say it ain’t so 😂
They never dated the men they were complaining about on there. Guaranteed. More like the men that rejected them. Or beat them for a promotion or a job.
I feel bad for these women, some of them will get kidnapped with all the crazies out there.
Why is it always the pretty ladies?😂
They gave their IDs to this app , how stupid can you get. They should all be monitoring their credit reports cause they just got scammed.
Complex Undefeated Ninja Tree Sap
Must have been an AI vibecode project
"We don't need MEN on our Cyber Security Team!" - Tea App Board Meeting Circa 2023
The app is all about men that sleep around, but suddenly they're all incels?
I commend the devs this time. That is a must check list for every men.
Looks like they just spilled the tea sis. 😅
That's just karma 😂
Should've waited at least 2 years before leaking
A win for the bros
4chan doing good things. The world is slowly getting better ❤️‍🩹 ❤🎉
they have the fucking nerve like we’re the ones that “prevent people from having fun” from the cancel crown themselves? fuck outta here
"Head on a swivel ladies"  Trust me woman, nobodies coming after you like that. Youre not that important or good looking
Alright we should make an App called Beer where only men are allowed to use the app. Where we post personal information about random girls. Is she a criminal. Her phone number. GPS location. All her photos. All her previous boyfriends. Etc. And talk amongst other men with dating advice on who is the most attractive and who to consider going out with. And see how long it takes to see everyone say the app is misogynistic against women. The app should be taken down immediately. And the app is committing crimes and leaking personal information. And activate the trap card double standard and say it's the same thing as the Tea app so what's the problem to get countered with their quick effect spell card of it's okay when we do it. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
hahah the irony
4chan, trolls or heroes? Both. 😎
Was this a Reddit vs 4Chan moment? 😅
This gotta be the quickest rise and fall I ever seen for a dating app.
for super earth! (background music is from helldivers 2)
*An oh-so-well-deserved case of poetic justice!*  *Makes me wonder if this wasn't the real reason the Tea app was created in the first place.  Well played "ladies"; ya played yourselves.*
The app wasn't even hacked, their dev skills were non existent, thinking their app needed no security. The content was all in a publicly accessible Cloud based storage, no encryption, no lock... just open for the world to see. The irony here, a proper "We don't need no man" moment 😆
When the doxers, get doxed! Love the karma here 🤣I never heard of this app, but it's hilarious what just happened! People are saying it got hacked, or leaked, but others are saying it just simply was created on open, insecure servers. What if the developer purposedly did this, to expose the harlots stupid enough to give really personal info to gain access, for the real garbage they are to the world?
Sounds like an UNO REVERSE card at its finest
Literally handed us a list of all of the undateable women.   The best part? They all voluntarily put themselves on the list.😂
why do they all look like a different variation of the same person 💀
They are exactly how I imagined them to be
More than a honey pot than a tea app
man i have a good feeling abiut this week.
Im having a fun time on the internet after these Tea leaks
Congrats ladies....you played yourselves!
I'm personally all for apps like Tea, I feel like it helps protect men from the types of women that would use an app like that
She’s a woman(?)hear her whine.
BIG W for us 😂😂😂
Thank you 4chan!
She’s just mad because she kept cutting her bangs crooked.
Its hilarious how they keep telling you "its about safty" (which im sure theres a few that were using it to stay safe) but it was mostly just revenge of the hen house
the haircut and  glasses  scream * dont have fun*
That womans fringe is a war crime
Play the victim again It keeps getting older Your story is over Your fairy tale's at the end
they literally want their own kiwifarms after taking it down????
Incel on incel crime
It's not jus the glasses. It's the haircut. You see those bangs, run for zee hills!!!!
All that got leaked was name, height, and weight with an unfiltered image. That's not that bad 😂.
Always give it up for the boys at 4chan
COOOOOONTEXT
The "women " only have themselves to blame . The irony is funny.
bpd haircut
Women are the downfall of Westren society.
Any chick with nose piercing and cooking pot haircut ia a straight up instant red flag.
0:27 That is the Tinder Swindler from Netflix!
“The incels are at it again”  Bitch you did this to yourself
Accountability is liberal women's Kryptonite.
First girl is a solid negative 5 and is calling people incels
My geo-tism of sorts is tingling. That map representation is... implausible, there are large areas of the US that are uninhabited so there shouldn't be pins literally all over it. But perhaps it's more of a stand in as a thumbnail. Otherwise I suppose some women still being as toxic as ever. Will they self reflect? Unlikely.
Women participate in a website that is designed to dox men. Women most affected.
Hmmm……is this just US or are they operating in Europe too? I don’t know what data laws are like in US but if they hold any European data…if they happened to receive a Data Subject Access Request, they would be legally required to hand over all requested personal data within 30 days. Failure to do so could result in whopping fines and the data subject could then take them to court for damages…just sayin. ….
Poetic justice.
They need Jesus. Ugly inside and out. I wonder if that's why those types of people hate Christianity so much? Jesus taught personal responsibility a lot of the time. That's starting to make a lot of sense.
Females Hate each other and nothing on that site is remotely trustworthy. Plus women refuse to accept responsibility for their own choices and actions. 😂
I don't think the last 20 sec should be included in this video. Aren't you opening up yourself for shit if you show their face + data from the  gov. id?
Women need social media access restriction. We can start to heal after.
South park was right once again
I'm 5'10" and fat (overweight), but not obese. How is it that these 5'2-5'6" women weigh as much as or way more than me?
Why do I feel like this happened before a few years ago? Something very similar happened, but I can't recall.
Create an app about gossiping about men. Women most affected.
"fun time on the internet" = "anonymously slandering you without your knowledge and making your life shittier" screw you bowl cut
The Tea app Is just the female version of Incels on Reddit. lol
Woulda been nice to only dox people who posted instead of people like my girl who only made one to make sure nobody was talking shit on me
The intentions are fine but how do these women genuinely not see the problem with how this is being executed. This kind of information should not be able to be freely accessed by others and its that simple. The fact that they do not see ANY of the irony in this is insane.
4chan W
Then: Let me upload pictures, name and defamations about my ex without his consent. Now: Oh no, now MY pictures and name are on the internet without my intent, the world is such a bad place
We need a app called coffee for us men fr
Kevin Samuels would have had a field day with all this.
thats deserved at that point
Hey at least they got plenty of public attention now, wasn't that what they wanted?
What happened to equality they can dox men and make all kinds of allegations, yet how dare men find out who they are They can tell everybody where you live and look like but how dare people find them out Modern Women are the biggest hypocrites ever, equality, when given they cry
Responsibility for your own safety is as follows: Don't put your DL and GPS tracking on some 3rd party site.
iv once again dug my own grave and crying about how deep it is and how I cant get out of it and how its not my fault- tea users
they all freaking out because they know what they were doing was/is morally unacceptable. but the female double standard allows it.   because notice what they are actually mad about. is it the leak itself? no. its the entire app itself being exposed that they are mad about. not one of these women are mad about the leak/hack itself. make that make sense
they leid about their weight
So in other words, the tea has been spilled
In the end, men always win. Feminists are the most vile creatures ever to exist in human history
Chicks "Do you also need my social security number?"
Sounds like it was a trap the whole time
@1:52 damn, she's heavier than I am
The Internet equivalent of " people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones"
There are enough people, this helps reduce the population.
Anything online is definitely not safe. Keep that in mind as our governments push us in this direction.
They didn’t gain access . Everyone just had it.
Lets be real here, this the best evidence I have ever seen of the fact that its male vs female incels, (both victims of the internet culture and social media manipulation), that are being effected by this male v female online culture war the most. They are lashing out at each other, unable to accept the fact they are not attracted to each and are both pig headed and unwilling to lower their standards. Sure the mainstream media is responsible for pushing one side, but internet, social media, and the counter media has its sway as well and are just as untrustworthy. Its all a mind game, a form of social and political theater, a psychological manipulation giving us the Gamergate girls and Tate Bros, all too happy to poison the well water for lonely insecure women and men. Men and women compliment one another extremely well, all this division and bs is astroturfed and being pushed on young lonely men and women, and in my opinion, it is by design. We should ignore it the best we can, and strive to be individuals in life, socialize in real life, and don't judge demographics, judge individuals and their actions, you are not your demographic, and neither is anyone you meet, no matter how much they may act like a stereotype, just remember, its their programing making them a stereotype (look closely inside yourself, we are all guilty of this at times), but watch your back, best not to engage with the fully delusional, and empathy for me does not extend past my own self interest and self preservation nor should it anyone else. I will say this leak is a great example of the old saying, "Whats good for the goose, is good for the gander".
is there any way i could see my Profile?? i have lost count of how many times i have been Ghosted?? lol
who would put their info in an app, you make that shit up on any sites you go on naturally right? like who even puts their real info, crazy, if it asks you your real info, you delete the app or leave the page, period.
"Fun time on the internet" Also just doxxing men
Omg wtf is with her hair
Wait, i havent been keeping up. So an app, designed to give a bunch of personal info about men, put up where everyone could see, was hacked, and the women who were on the app, had their personal info put up where everyome could see..... and theyre mad about it..... my head hurts. Its not built for this kind of mental gymnastics
I would laugh if this was the app creators plan from the beginning. Big brain.
Doxing app gets doxed.
You can't spell undateable without tea.
1:18 has to be the most unattractive woman ive ever seen
im having SO much fun on the internet, laughing, though!
Hogs mad.
I've been seeing the "new" American right wing using the left's tactics against them for over a year now. It is especially amusing to hear them cry about the very things they are doing to others.
It’s called karma, ladies. It’s not a new concept.
An app made to dox men 4-Chan took that personally and proceeded to dox all users of the doxing app in retaliation users/doxers of the app pickachu face
No one will ever beat the weaponized autism of 4chan
Holy shit, my fucking eyes. At this point I feel like blind people have an advantage on this sort of thing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not even close to being an 8 but at least I am not these people.
Oh the misandrists online are complaining about men again.
Oh no, they looks like crap 😂 Who would've thought?
Honestly I’m totally okay with an app that encourages these creatures to stay away from guys in the dating pool. It’s like they’re dodging bullets for me.
From what I understand, the only people affected by it was anyone who signed up prior to February 2024.  Even then, it's humorous to watch.
Thank you for your service, 4Chan.
I wanted to create a similar app but against women who cheat, has too many kids by different baby daddies,  who collect child support,  has an OnlyFans and who has a criminal record in order to protect Men.
Plot twist: 4Chan created this App. 😂😂😂😂
i used to hate dudes, but i know some actually solid ones these days, in australia its pretty easy to say every female i've known has been a victim to a male in some way, usually physically, ususally sechually. my se_ key doesn't work damn keyb haha, but holy shit i'm so sick of these 'every male is a POS' black n white fks, i've always prided myself on one thing, associating with good people, and i know for a fact the dudes i know are rare, but so is a sane woman at this point. gay for pay is lookin twice as good now, holy shit.
When Cancel Karen’s get doxxed… gotta love Divine Retribution
So Zuckerberg did facemash as revenge on girls from campus. Then Tea made facemash of any men and also with personal protected data. So they already beat Mark by 2 lvls of extreme. But then sensitive data of users leaked. Or rather was stolen by group from 4chan and they made facemash of Tea users. What a beautiful circle 😂
4chan lol.  they have always been legendarily benevolent in their mischief.  rarely do these talented hackers do overtly malicious things.  I'm proud of them for this tea app leak.
boring
These women act like they arent the exact same thing as the incels that they criticize so much. They have the same vitriol for the opposite sex, they have no good connection with any men in their lives, they constantly spread lies and slander, while also having absolutely outlandish theories on how men live, think and act, they are no different than the incels at all. These are literally reddit moderator loser women.
"somebody nasty leak that" yeah.. sure..
Imagine waking up one morning and thinking to yourself: "I'm gonna go with the Joe Dirt and Moe Howard haircut mix. I'm so unique."
Jeez, can't have fun doxxing men
So the women in the video. “Date men” Seems more like lesbians trying to ruin mens reputations for sport.
1:30 Wasn’t it that female actress from Harry Potter who said: “Feminism is basically ANTi-MEN”? Now you have an App version of that.
So it's an app thats all about doxxing men, and now theyre mad they've been doxxed. Got it. Very hilarious
The weight part wraps it all together lol 😂😂😂😂
The Incels are at it again!! XD
It's fun seeing the people behind a doxxing app complaining about having accidentally doxxed themselves instead. Karma is sweet.
_"Well if it isn't the consequences of my actions. Nope, not this time accountability! It's the incels and the app responsible! I'm... just a girl"_ 🥰
Its fun seeing the list and it's better than dating apps because if you find a girl you think you might like you can just show up to her house and take her out on a date or whatever you want so thank God for the tea app and the spill 😂😂😂
A bit of sick came into my mouth.🤢
Love it!
Fuckass 2/10 ugly ahh seeting, it's awesome
So the Tea App is just a dox app? If a woman that has NPD traits she can easily use the tea app and start a smear campaign against her victims.
One of the internet hall monitors complaining that we’re not allowed to have fun in the internet…
what a disgusting looking human. you already know her personality before you speak to her lol.
its crazy that the bottom of the barrel woman catfishing as "dating pool woman" looking for dates.
The filters were a lie who would've seen it coming
Some of those women looks like the aliens from Buckaroo Banzai...
Is SeaWorld offering a reward for their beluga whales?
We all knew they were ugly. But this harrowingly ugly??😂😂
Where do you go to play tea spill?
An incel calling all men incels. Crazy.
I played the game where you rank them, and currently, the #1 ranked woman on the leaderboard is a picture of a Logitech computer mouse.
Ladies…uh no. ‘Ladies’ in my day meant there was some class and morality involved.  Have no fear and DON’T worry about keeping your head on a swivel. You just gathered in one place— basically an island of misfits with terrible hair, crazy eyes, and things through your nose —where no sane man would ever sail or swim to. 😂 🏝️
It’s always the ugliest people on the inside and out lol
Jesus, I was eating when he showed the leaked pictures
men dont need an app to know which women are keepers or not because we can all just tell
You spelled "exponentially more hilarious" wrong.
Fatteas app more like.
Did women forget hacking exist. Tbf they forget a lot or.just don't know much in general
Its funny cause she is what i would describe an incel to look like
Hopefully everyone who had their information maliciously passed around sues the hell out this company, and the fruit and/or vegetable that created; it in a class action suit. The US legal system isn't anywhere near being able to manage misconduct on the internet; and they've had over 20 years to get there.  They don't even seem to know what to do about swatting, people got away with that horrific shit for well over a decade now. It certainly doesn't seem to help that politicians are using political offices as retirement homes.
They created lists about you but get mad when you create a list of the ones creating the lists
Now make an app that has all the faces of all these women that were on the app lmao make it where you can send in a picture of their face and name and it can search the database to find them in there and show you lmao don't reproduce with these types of women
Those are those who say, im a 9/10
Nice; trace buster buster
what's the site where you can rate these monsters?
UK said hold my Tea to this one.
NOTHING IS 100% SECURE *Stop posting your sinful ways online*
I can't wait for the internet historian's vídeo on this
Hear me out. What if it wasn't a leak, and all along this was a ploy for people to out themselves. A man made the app with the full intention of putting all the people on blast who were going to put everyone else on blast
This gives a whole new meaning to the term 'teabagging'
So, what gets leaked is less info than what they themselves were putting on the app and yet they are the ones to feel unsafe?  The absolute hypocrisy and lack of accountability is astounding
A liberal bubble for idiots
All 10s, every single one of them. Just ask them.
170-190 how can someone be such a massive hog, pig, cow, whale, seal, elephant, hippo?!? How can someone like that be trusted to review ppl that wouldn’t never have the stomach to touch them not even with a gun to their heads? :)))
we got em boys
Another 4chan W
Should have never gave rights to women!!!
REPEAL THE 19TH
I find disturbing the fact she sees doxxing as "fun" that has been taken away from her...
Those fucked up bangs pretty much say everything I need to know about this woman.
REPEAL THE 19TH
... .--. .. .-.. .-.. .-.-.- .. -. ..-. --- .-.-.- --. ..-. The link to the game in morse code fellas ;)
Insane how they're ALL ugly.. And i can guarantee 90% of the "tea" is just flat out lies.
irony encarnet.
Creates an app ALL ABOUT doxing mens Gets surprised when they get doxed Get bent idiots.
No hot woman cares. Lol
What we have here is clear case of karen karma. FAFO.
Bet you $100 a woman made that app, that's why it got hacked.
TBH, this app was saving men. If you got doxed, none of these women would want to date you. That's the best good news I've heard this month. Toxic women are removing themselves from the dating pool!
5'3" 200lbs😂
I got cooties, just from looking at their mustachioed faces.
"Can't have fun time on the internet at the expense of all men, no sir, no no no, men run everything"
Everyone on that app is the problem with the world
Super Earth anthem detected, redirecting focus to enemies of Super Earth.
Make a list of all these women because signing up to gossip and dox people is a big red flag
someone spilled the tea
Well tea is for dunking..... usually biscuits, but not in this case.
These women really need to look inward or they will never understand they are the problem
they were literally doxxing people and then got mad because they got doxxed lol
Disgusting app that never should have existed, but then disgusting ogre men respond with the usual disgusting behavior of always talking sh*t about women's appearance and posting their faces to bash them. Those are a mix of NORMAL women. I bet most of these men bitching are no beauties either. How about everyone stop doxing and bashing other people?
WTF haircut was that 1st one??!!
I could be locked up in prison for a decade, never see a single female, and after being released, still would not find those women to be attractive.
I’m 5’6 and i thought I was a Hog at 155. I do have a belly tho my friends say I need to put on muscle weight
Disgusting creatures
Asmon needs to talk about card companies
Remember, there is a god, her name is Karma, and she has a really sick sense of humor
Best honeypot in history to catch crazy people. HR offices arround the world should double check if these people work there. They might get sued by men for discrimination if some of these people work there.
Girl has military grade bangs.
It is women like that who are also behind the ban of games on Steam.
they don’t have to worry about their information being leaked. no rational person would want to come after them anyways
Gen z would crumble and start offing themselves if OG 4chan was still around. Twitter wouldn’t stand a chance maybe Reddit but everything else would fall to 4chan, all hail 4chan lord!! 🤟🏽👏🏽💀
literally no one who is actually suffering any kind of meaningful victimization is this insufferable about it
Since the beginning of the internet, it was known not to mess with the people of 4chan. When did these femcels not get the memo? These dudes hacked federal servers.
You already know those fatties were the ones talking the most shit😂
Get rekt, also she need to fire whoever did that hairline.looking like lord farquaid
And tell me honestly - would women like that give honest opinions about why a guy was a red flag?
260 lbs as a woman is astonishing, they carry it differently. Men have denser bones and more muscle mass, 260 on a man is fat, but maybe strong. 260 on a lady, run for the hills!!!! Best case she was the catcher on a softball team and has some muscle, but she is still a woman, and they wear 260 lbs very very very differently than a man does. LOL. Good Gracious.
There was no hack. The Tea app "engineers", left all the pics on a publicly available Google Cloud bucket.  No laws were broken.
wtf. why is there the weight
Full of 3s thinking they deserve 6s
The Hungry Hippo dating app is more appropriate of a name.
I hope there is an investigation.  Because that would involve cataloging all the accusations made with the malicious intent of damaging men’s reputations.
she's got the type of haircut a spoiled middle eastern toolboy around the age of 18-22 would have hahaha, at least in the front, and don't tell me I'm wrong, I'm soooooo right.
I... might need that list... so I can add all those indentheader women on a "Stay the fk away from that thing at all costs, keep it away from your family, keep it away from your friends..." list. I have a blacklist for companies who I will never do business with ever again, and I'll actively buy the competitor counterpart. So, making this "stay the fk away" list, isn't that far fetched.
all the gross yuck woman are mad everyone knows how gross they are
This is literally: "Rules for thee, not for me."  They literally created a doxxing app, and now are pissed they got doxxed.
Women's defition of safe space: "a place where we can spread rumours about men we hate and they can't do anything about it"
0:05 Ooooooo, what’s the tea? 🫖  Noo wayy…more leaks!?  😂 Haha can’t catch a break,huh?  How does it feel?
"How dare men expose me for being a sexist hypocrite who leaks others' personal information!!!" On a high note, at least all the Karens put themselves on a public list so you know who the hell to stay away from
All is far in love and war.
we call these "problem bangs" the shorter the bangs, the bigger her problems.
Are those reddit and discord mods????
Femcels be wildin....
1:30 What the hell is even that
I'll wake up screaming tonight, "The haircuts! The haircuts!"
ahahahahahahahahahah so f*ckin juicy!!!!!
This reads like an elliot roger tier incel delusion but its actually real, these "women" are straight up pathetic.
Why'd she copy Chit's haircut
The real reason they created this app is so other countries could get people's info cause back during Trump's first term China said they were going to create fake apps and games to get people's info
Now this is good content. The best content. There's been good content before, not as good as this content.
You've been struck by... a Bad mullet...
How are you this chronically online and still believe that anything is secure? Chase Bank has had data leaks. You thought random app on the appstore has better security than Chase Bank? Things on the internet are there forever. Once you send it out, you might as well consider it gone. The naivete of some people amazes me.
Was this app created and coded by women or something? Lol
That chicks haircut is awful.
Baseball, huh?
Pink bicycles getting stealth pump and dumps. A tale as old as time.
1:48 5" 3 200 pounds good god im sure its heavier
Wait, muricans have height, weight, eye color written on their ID's???
After hearing this. We now have a rough estimate of how many stupid women there are from this. And yes, I know there are a lot more buffalos out there than what has been reported.
Doxxing and cyberstalking men. "WoMen ArEn'T aLlOwEd tO hAvE fUn"
Damn is nobody on that app above a 2?
Beer app for men only lets start one guys
Lol, why is there helldivers music in the background
just a bunch of 1s and 2s trying to make the world work around them and when something they dont like happens its wrong yet what they were doing was not to them. damn they all must work on 1 brain
Living life while being single has made me more happy than ever. Purchase house without someone taking money from me every day. No fighting over stupid shit. Get to enjoy my hobbies anytime I want. Cook my own food and eat what I want. No clogged bath drains. No shark week armor required. No psycho's in my circle. These women these days.... happy to die this way. Just need my dog is all :-)
She wanted "bangs" and the barber gave her "bangs?"
Giving all my information to an app so I can talk sh*t about men sounds like something a woman would do
these women have an average rating of 2 out of 10, not surprising of course
The absolute space cadet lack of awareness by those two women is just mind boggling.
Femcel app
It’s so funny that not a single one of the leaks is decently attractive 😭. If you hate on me for this. It takes one to know one! 😂
doxing :) getting doxed :(
"It's fine if I dox you, but not me"
yea well they were doing the same thing so 0% empathy
Oh no! the people participating  in a doxing app got doxed
"No one can have a fun time on the internet" *Welcome to the club, lady. Where none of us were having fun to begin with. Mostly from people like you!*
There's just such a profound lack of moral or intellectual clarity.
they're all fat!
As my girl put it, I hate it when women prove men right by being stupid.
The modern Western woman is decisively leading our entire civilization to ruin.
Their weight on the driver's license is probably what's going to send these dipshits into the biggest rage lol
It's all ugly chicks.......big surprise😂😂😂
The fallout from this is going to be astounding.
Wow, the ones posting all the "man bad" were actual fucking goblins.
Imagine complaining about "not being able to have fun" and your "fun" is literally doxxing people. What the actual fuck is wrong with these fucking maniacs?
"Nobody can have fun on the Internet"  I don't know about that ...4Chan's been having a blast for over 20 years.
For Super Earth!!!
It is easier to cry than to change - James Baldwin

Feminists: Let's create an app to screw men up...  Someone: Let's screw this app up... Feminists: <surprised pikachu face>
We need to repeal the 19th amendment
The Helldivers 2 theme in the background is what’s sending me 😂😂😂
What the hell are these pictures that are getting used? Why would you look at one of those and think  "Yep, that's me and that's how I want everyone to see me."  ? 🤦‍♂️
"noone can have fun on the internet..." You get what you give.  Those glasses and the front only bowl cut.
Wait, so it was an app created for women to post men's private information and now they're mad that their private information got leaked. What the fuck?
ive checked the full leak, ya its way worse than it seems.....lets just say they also shared nudes of  the people
Dr Pepper is rank 1 on the Leaderboard btw  Yes, we prefer Dr Pepper to Women.
so women who were basically cyberbullying on an app get mad when the same thing happens to them?
4chan are so based man holy crap.
Can't have fun on the internet as a woman? Really? OF would disagree.
How can a woman wear the obvious "I hate myself" haircut, and go in public or post herself on the internet, is beyond me...
1:50 No I read is that there were *NO security measures!* It was ALL publicly available URLs! It's not a hack or a leak. It was just downloaded, open access JPGs & gps info.
Love it 😂😂😂
Glasses like that or Lord Farquaad bangs are warnings to us all.  Run away.
notice how she outs the true purpose in the very beginning of her video. it was never about safety, it was about having fun at someone else's expense.
U know its over when u got 4chan in it
BROOOO!  I'm laughing my ass off, we finally have PROOF, when these women are calling you a piece of shit looser THEY ARE PROJECTING, you doing great bro, keep it up!
This happens right as the UK government made it a requirement to upload pictures to prove your age on restricted content. Gotta love it.
That haircut calling someone incel is hilarious
REPEAL THE 19TH
All the Tea users just got publicly TEA-BAGGED.  Instant Karma!
I’m confused…why is reddit removing posts where these doxxers get exposed? Not knowing who is out there possibly spreading misinformation and fictitious criticism seems extremely dangerous and unsafe for all men. Someone needs to call Morgan & Morgan lol. It’s class action time.
Asmongold is really an incel, god
Back to being the victim again huh.
The hair on the 1st giant clownglasses 🤓🤓 troll is 💀 Women like her intentionally uglify. Her smug sneering smile & self victimhood makes her worse. They advertise who their type with appearance and think they are better than everyone. "We can't even have fun" 🙄 fun is being hate stalkers, dat's kewl. 🫩
People who use the app = teabags
Seems to be a whale of a time on that app. Okay, ill see my self out after that.
Wonder how many Sweet Baby inc employees were in the leak.
Helldivers music is just perfection
You find 1 cutie out of 300 is diabolical.
I wouden't let any program access the gps cords on my phone,  Even the go-pro app demanded it enabled for it to work so i just uninstalled it.
back when I was single ( I've been married for ... 14 years now ) I would have avoided all the women shown for the same reason I avoided the beautiful people that look like 'high maintenance'.  They say 'dont judge a book by its cover' and I say bullshit. You can tell they are smug know it-alls seething with resentment and hatred.  Little bit of wisdom here ( I'm turning 40 so I get to pretend at least ) they don't really hate men. It's self-loathing and they don't want to take responsibility for it so they project it onto others.  again, judge a book by its cover and don't let any "politically correct" fool convince you that you shouldn't try to make intelligent observations about someone's character. Especially when so much is on the line.
Yeah, it’s the incels fault. Still no responsibility taken.
All of our social problems are caused by 2 groups of people.
Not only do they know where the women are from, they know exactly who each of them are, how old they are and where they live.  Congratulations, you played yourselves.
☕
Their anger makes so much more sense once you realize it's 100% projection of self loathing.
Women are more privileged than men in the west
0:17 FUCKING HILARIOUS 😂
the bitch bitching about fun has never known fun
their ‘making fun on the internet’ literally committing crime, these brainless femcels are hilarious
"head on a swivel ladies"  bro, aint no one coming for your skanky ass LMAO We staying 100 miles away
When the weights showed and some were under 200lbs the photos absolutely did not match that weight. Not a single photo in this video was of a girl that should be under 200lbs unless they are also under 5 feet tall (Height affects weight a lot). A girl can be over 200lbs, but if she's like 5'10 she wont look like these round jabba faced things, Heck if she's 6 foot and lifts a bit, 200lbs isnt bad at all, weight as a number can be deceptive sometimes when combined with height and BMI index. I mean look at all the photos in this, all of those girls if they were over 5'4 would be well over 200lbs so they are either lying on drivers licenses, as I'm pretty sure they actually ask you your weight, or its just been a long time and alot of lbs since they renewed their license or ID or whatever it is. Women have been doing this gossip ring en mass for a while now, whether its facebook groups, or other social media group platforms where a certain region can "spill their tea" like the "Are we dating the same guy" groups and whatnot. Its pretty gross and women using these for the most part should be doxxed, or men should get just as organized and start doing the exact same databases to help our brothers stay away from toxic gold diggin trainwrecks too, somethings gotta give, this is really just further dividing the sexes, and we already have a birth rate crisis worldwide except the middle east, northern africa and south west asia and not only those regions but the immigrants that come from them have no problem making new humans, we might not agree with the practices, but they get the job done. Essentially the "white" race, if you can even call it that, and the Eastern Asian races including China, are on a massive birth rate decline. I'd wager social media isnt helping with that whatsoever, and contributes negatively.
You need to be a Power Ranger to take on these abominations.... 😅😂😅
Why is she talking anyway?! Nonone wants her!
Male logic: it doesn’t matter they’re unattractive
5'3" 200 pounds is wild
😂
EW bro im eating 🤮🤮
so 0s and 1s and 2s were comlaining that dudes that were 6s or 7s or 8s said no thank you??? SO men cant say no to women they arent attracted to? oMFG
Is that even a woman with that hair cut. Looking like rock lee. 😂 Also all those male profiles are fake and you just gossiping and inventing nonsense about bots. You do realize that app was created to get women's info and then when we got it and trapped ya we flipped the switch. You thought you were trapping us when in actuality we were trapping you. Now we have the whole library of Karen's to look out for. ✌️
It's insane they create a whisper network reeking of misandry and then cry misogyny when they get called out.
Play stupid games and win stupid prices. As someone who spent quite good amount of time creating and working on software. Trust me nothing is safe on network,even after deletion.
"Change color, pick up four"  I've never seen a woman with a bowl cut before.
the hoes are literally everywhere
The fact that the #1 ranked person on the teaspill game is a can of Dr. Pepper
it's amazing how an ID is more honest than a woman.  A piece of plastic got more credibility than these orcas
the fuck is a foid?   Also god damn these people, like they wanted to create a list of undatable people? like, wow, self report harder _PLEASE_
but aren't they supposed to have a tea in prison as well?
That’s karma for these girl failures!
How do you play the Teaspill game?
Those are the most discusting haircuts ive ever seen in my life
They all weigh over 160lbs! Everyone of them. That's crazy.
God i love 4Chan, legends.
Thanks ladies made it all equal😂😂😂
"fun"
Can't wait for nothing to happen because we actually aren't insane psychopaths.
1:20  Weedwhacker Haircut has an opinion
They all look EXACTLY the same lmao  Toxic predators dressed up as victims
"Dear Lord, please don't show me any more of their Roasties, I've seen enough ugly women for a hundred lifetimes 😢 😔"
"Noone can have a fun time on the internet" Proving once again a womens idea of "fun" is hurting others.   Women arent as "caring and empathetic" as society tells you they are
Turnabout is fair play.
I told you dont mess with the collectors cause it wont end well
Why are all the women who used that app ugly?
Good, the pictures prove what everyone already knew about the app. Troglodytes can kick rocks.
I know loads of men and women (& every other pronoun) who have fun online thanks
Gorlok is gonna be so mad about this when she finds out...

Can we now talk about Toxic femininity ?
Wwwooow
You spelled better wrong
The most embarrassing thing is how easy it was to breach and leak everything.. Was it some vibe coding loser?
did i hear democratic theme ????????/
someone spilled the tea.
Remove and ban any such app from ever being made!
It was first used on Charlie Harper.
its so funny how these women where doxxing men on this app and now they are crying when karma hits. Also its just extra funny that most women that use this shit also happens to look like Jabba the Hutt.
The irony of getting upset at your personal information being out there without your consent when that's the very thing they were doing on the app is only lost on them 😂
Neither of those women looked straight, I'm very confused. Also this type of app should be illegal.
Where can i find this list to check potential partners
Notice how women's "fun" involves blatant, shameless abuse of other unwilling people (MEN). And somehow they still have no idea how the literal computer, with location tracking and cameras, they spend every waking moment in front of knows where they are and what they look like...
hmm, sounds like a type of discrimination.. we men should push for a class action lawsuit against the company that produced the app.. take em for every penny.. could you imagine if an app wad made for only men to share pictures and private information about our ex girlfriends?! the fucking government would stop that shit immediately, every feminist would be on fucking man hunt over it.. but yeah.. jesus.
Whats the game?
Turnabout is fair play.
the Helldivers music in the background caught me off guard
I didn't catch the part where they made a "Am I Hot or Not?" app for it hah
“Fun time”
As someone who smashes both parties girls wives and GFs...who cares about an app, when ya get women 1 on 1 its a different game. Relax folks, go get laid. Lol
With those bangs she might be balder than Asmongold
I don’t get how they don’t get it. I mean, I’m not perfect. But when someone points out I’m being hypocritical, most of the time I have the ability to self reflect. Giving out the personal info of the people giving out personal info isn’t an attack. It’s literally what they asked for
That is a lot of whales.
Women must be kept safe but just the name of the app makes it sound like it's for gossip and defamation
she's literally the human "erm achkually" emoji bitch my god, right down to the face and attitude!
They should've done more research instead of just clicking agree to terms of service lol. the hilarious part about this is Asmongold looks like he would be the male version of these photos 😂. My dude looks like the creepy uncle you keep your kids away from, homeboys got donkey teeth with gaps big enough to throw a tennis ball between, he looks like a 70's pedophile 😂. If he has a girl, we all know it's for the income, she'd leave him in a heartbeat if his yearly income isn't over the 6 digits😂
Lol what kind of idiot falls for that
"How dare you leak our info, for building an app which leaks people's info?"
Those bangs scream "I'm a professional victim".
hm! my ex has been exposed... women...
These queens are the victims! oh man! better blame men! 😂😂
"noone can have fun. thanks incels" are they having fun doxing men they date with other mentally insane peers of theirs??
All ugly bitter women 😂
I refuse to believe that even half of these women have ever been with any man
Sounds like defamation
sure the glasses, but that hair cut😂😂
funny how to made a app for guys.... but if i wanna know if a girl is a 304... all i gotta do is ask one or 2 guy and boooom i know
Having fun is posting real pictures of men and spewing libel against them?
LOL
i had an ex that stood by this kind of app when i said "women would HATE if there was an app like this about them" and she said dudes already do it publically and i been dumbfounded since cuz theres a difference between 5 dudes standing around saying "smash or pass" and half the world catalogging the other half of the world lmao
"somebody nasty" can describe a good chunk of tea leaf users, and leaking info can describe the majority.
how  do we unleak it? can we put it all back?? dear god i dnt wanna see any of these pictures ever gain wtf
The glasses? That haircut screams I'm lame from a mile away.
shit people
blaming others before self typical modern women😂
"no one can cyberharass on the internet anymore :(" is basically her response lol  edit: also DAMN she looks fented 2:00
Gossip while a healthy activity (psychologically) has never contributed towards public safety. This is straight up a doxxing/slander app. If men did the same thing.... Wooo the backlash would be interesting to compare.
It's utterly bewildering that those women on The Tea App are calling us "incels" when they look like a bunch of inbreds.
Looks like an outbreak of demons.
I love home they're trying to use safety as a pretext for doxing other people.   You know there used to be the same called dating within your extended friend group so if you were interested in someone you could simply ask another friend about the person that you're interested in and they would tell you whether they're dangerous or not.  But you literally cannot  Be upset with getting doxxed  When you are on an app that was designed to dox people.  It's pretty easy to actually avoid dangerous guys,  For one if you choose to actually Prioritize guys that you view s safe over men that you view as "interesting"  that already Cuts down a lot of the male predators out there.  It also helps to not date the same top 15% of men who are on the app.
As a wise person, once said Rules for thee and not for me
Friendly reminder that this wasn't 4 Chan hacking the database or using some complicated bypass system. This was stored in a publicly accessible database and all it required was a URL. The developer of this app is 100% at fault and is a prime example as to why you should be careful who you give your data to.
4chan is the god of balanc (trolling and leak unfair data)
What the fuck are those bangs?
"The birthrate is falling! It's all mens fault!" yeah, sure.
I love when Darwins theory keeps coming back into the fold. Hopefully, none of these women breed, and TBF they are all INCELS themselves.
Is she wearing a beanie, or are those her bangs? I've never understood that haircut.
you didnt see guys crying like this when women got the dirty taken down
Really want editor lore. Super curious if he uses AI voice or is real British guy
Wait till the defamation lawsuits start. 🍿
We're living some very strange times...
The Super Earth anthem during the British voice over goes hard.
If you cant take the flak then dont dish it out in the first place, doesnt matter whats between your legs. 4chan W
American women speed running devolution
I wonder how many of these doxxed locations are fast food places 😂
Bless 4chan
I've said for years.  Thick rimmed black glasses.
LMFAO
I look at these women with so much disgust it hinders my hope in the entire human race
So is this verified as real?  Women, on a site dedicated to badmouthing men, sharing their personal and other info, are complaining when THEIR personal info, from that same site, is hacked and shared...???
Single dudes, remember to do the Tea Background check before committing to a date! Be sure she wasnt "one of them"! 😂
Women: I cannot believe the internet would put our information out on the internet for everyone to see like that! Men: Yeah, imagine that...
The girl in the first 10 seconds has that Loyd Christmas haircut going on😭🤣
They are all hideous, 260lbs holy shiiiiiiit 💀
Someone make an anti-Tea app that uses the data leak and warn you if your nearby a user of the Tea app :T
So terrible people doing terrible things are mad because they got caught then got a taste of their own medicine?  You can’t make this this shat up it beyond a classic scenario !
So many Jabbas!
So this app was made for ugly women to false acusing handsome males. Anyone surprised?
Womenese defense : That was a Non Gender and the F stands for Far away.
lets make one for woman guys
Bunch of muff divers.
Hahaha stay anonymous kids.
look at her fucking bangs....jesus
Virtually all of the women on there were/are liberal, fugly and undateable. (Tattoos and snot catcher nose rings are a dead giveaway) These types are the reason why men are increasingly deciding to remain single! Not worth the hassle of having to put up with idiots like this!
This might be the 2020’s equivalent of the Ashley-Madison hacking scandal.🤔
4chan bro's are relentless...
Having Fun On The Internet  The Real Way: Share stereotypical memes about the generic guy meant to be humorous.  The Tea Way: Try to ruin real peoples’ lives.
*Peak Misandry*
0:18 I want to hear what some of the other women say about her bangs.
Society says women are the smarter and fairer gender.  I don't see it.
lol they made them fess up to their weight to sign up?  Come on, you weren't even trying to protect your personal info.  As if the fappening taught us nothing.
The glasses and bangs are red flags.
That brunet has an atrocious haircut.
TeaSpill is a hilarious name tbh
Bro why she got a mullet?
This is how I explain "irony" to people.
Wouldn't that app be illegal? Doesn't it violate the law about posting photos of people without their consent and doxxing?
Wait a minute, hold up, are you trying to tell me it was just a feminist men hating circle jerk all along. What a shocking turn of events, who could have seen that one coming
Its not personal, the floor is lava
most this "women " look like lesbians , poor lads never stood a chance
Hardest part to believe of any of this is that they had interactions with males in the first place
So the ugliest women of the world made a cope site so they could complain about the men who saw them for what they are, very ugly women with bad personalities.
Needed a government-issued ID to join a gossip app, but it's too much to ask to vote in national elections?
1:49 It's just hog after hog...
Hey guys we have an app just for girls.   We just need you data, other people's data you have collected from this person, your licensed government ID and for safety measures we will have your exact pin point location.
Wasn't even a hack, its looked like it was a basic python script that downloaded the JSON file that stored all this info, because it was literally publicly available, there was no security or encryptions, these idiots literally handed over their personal info to the most unsecure type of data broker...hope nobody has a problem with identity theft...such a stupid move.
man where can I find that site?
They vindictively dox and belittle men and wonder why no one wants to date them.
"Somebody nasty" says somebody nasty
Women are hypocritical by nature. If this ordeal doesn't prove it then I don't know what does.
the guys dating these women should have their man card revoked... there is a limit on desperation, have some standards and dignity for fucks sake.
1:47 HOLY SEA DONKEYS, BATMAN!
So this is the list trump didnt want us to see? 😂
Is it any wonder why these women need to rely on an app like this? It just makes what they would normally do easier.
gee, I wonder why women would ever feel the need to make a space where they can discuss and warn each other about local men.   I wonder the F why.   *looks up rates of SA and R*
I gotta wash my eyes.
The secret torta society
So many upset Spincels. Exposing the venom inherent in their system.
I'm astonished. Not even if I were a research sociologist could I get such an accurate and tangible portrait of the Karenverse. This app deserves 5 stars.
Funny, these women gave away all their information right down to their exact location probably just to be targeted by seriously bad actors in the world.  Bravo!  Bravo!  Cartel's are probably working on how to scam them as we speak!
ooo she's getting sued sued. Maybe even sued sued sued when all those men find out all their info is online with made up stories because you know how women are. lol them women trying to put 180 ish pounds but then it shows the pic hahahahha
ngl, this is funny af. Taking part in a doxxing app, just to get the same treatment in return. The thing is: who tf gives their ID to some random app to save in their database? That is beyond stupid. The only party you give your ID to online is the government, because they already have it, so it won't make a difference either way and you do it over a secure connection, not the Mc Donalds wifi.
One someone has the doofus haircut they shouldn't be talking, period. 😂
So let me see if I understood, they made an APP to expose ppl, using personal info and even photos, and they see no problem... But then when they are the ones leaked, then is bad? lmao
Jesus that hairline was bad and im not talking about asmon
How do they all look so similar?
This is why I don't like apps
"incel" is a loser's argument. Never seen anyone using that term as an insult when they were winning. It is always low quality women that use it and the bottom end of "men" that wish those low quality women would mate with them that use it.
*Willingly uploads personal data to a doxxing app*  *Gets doxxed*  "How could the incels do this to us?"
Equality except when it doesn't benefit them.
Did they have biologists on staff to determine who is and who is not a woman? Also, how can this be done via ID card?
What is that haircut? They had the same haircut wtf is happening
Do men date women with that haircut?
What’s the website? I can’t find it 0:57
4Chan doing the work of the Gods.
1:32 - *Poor girl blew her nose and the devil is popping out....*
This is what I needed on Sunday morning
the game is great. it even has a leaderboard.
"4chan intelligentia" 😂
Look at the upside, at least the app was designed by women.
What is that abomination you are watching? I'll bet she smells like birkinstocks, granola and shame.
They must work with Chit and he cuts their hair during lunch break.
Love you using the HD2 theme.
What can you even say to this? You just can't fix stupid. You can't protect stupid from themselves. They will always find a way to lower the bar.
I guarantee anyone with a nose like that wants white people to become displaced
Remember, when some one calls you an incel, this is who it is.
An incel is any straight man under 30 not having sex at this second and most over 30.
Im sure a lot of these women are just larping, but would a photo leak of Tinder men be that much better?
So will there be an app to avoid the women who used this app?
im sorry, a us defence employee joined a website that was so unprotected that you could literally just go to the website for the backend database, and she gave it her actual government details  i dont rate american defences anymore, that was the one thing  what you gonna tell me next, all the guns are made of card, glue, hopes and dreams ?
That…ladies…is what we call karma 🤣🤣🤣
All of those women are 1's.  They are complaining that men out of their league don't want to take them serious in relationships longer than a one night stand.  Hrm?
0:54 lmao 🤣🤣 If y’all know my boss tell em I’m getting out of the navy now — fuck tb
Pardon me but aren't these the same women recently asking why men dont approach anymore? Lol
So, we are going to let those bangs just slide. OK 😂
1:34 shes disgusting
This is perhaps the best thing to ever happen to men 😮  Now we can make a list by area of who to avoid 😊
you know how people tell you "its okay to have an ugly face, as long as u have good personality" well these people just proved its that fucking hard to do so
These women just look like incel themselves
What’s even more weird is after I seen scam likely post himself getting mad red flags the next day or 2 this happened
Always the damn tortas!!!!!
So.. the app is not racist for requiring a Government issued ID to sign up?  But voter ID... clearly racist.
The app was completely reckless with their data and pics.  All of this was uploaded to the internet by the app and available without any encryption.  You just needed to know how html works to find and access it.
They hit men with the Pearl Harbor and got mad that they got clapped back with the Hiroshima.
You're a fool if you willingly submit any form of government ID to a "social media" app.
Imagine if men made an app that talks about women and how easy they where to sleep with, how they compare with and without makeup, what they are insecure about etc i wonder how that would be perceived.
Dating is like fishing. What sort of fish you catch depends entirely on what sort of bait you use. Wrong sort of fish, then change your bait.
She's got a worse hairline than Asmon. An absolutely diabolical hairline
The frog-eyed one at the end had me DYING!
Woman’s hot or not app 😂 sounds familiar
If that haircut isn't a red flag, Idk what is. Sheeshe.
was that the helldivers2 theme? HAHA
U know, I dont think ive seen the person who created the app but was it a guy or a girl? if it was a guy that would be gold, also curious if someone who was a guy who worked on it did anything with the info
It was literally just femcels making up gossip about guys because theyre jealous of other girls potentially getting in relationships
So women on a doxin' app got doxxed?  Divine tier irony. 🤣
The irony is crazy
And this is why I'll remain single. Coz of those nasty npcs. Thanks, modern feminism. 💩
1:04  is that the fkn super earth national anthem. Based asf.  This whole thing is one or the best Internet events ever 🤣
it wasn't hacked the DEVELOPERS LEFT IT PUBLIC, they cannot blame some basement dweller dweeb, it was the developers fault!!!!
Tits or GTFO. one of the founding sacred rules of the internet. the more normies dont learn the founding sacred rules the worse it all becomes.
That tea spill game is actually fun and funny, NGL.
🚨🚨ALERTA DE FLEQUILLO🚨🚨
omg, her haircut.  Clear indication of a mental illness.
All list of all the woman to avoid, amazing
They are all Rosie O'Donnels
if the karens didn't want their Tea to Leak, then they should have gotten a better cup. simple
Why are all the images of the guys the best picture they could find lol.
Back in the mid/late 90s there was a click of mid girls that would accuse literally any boy that was even slightly interested in them as being gross stalkers. They weren't popular girls, they weren't the backup plan for people who didn't get their first choice for school dances. They didn't even have boyfriends their entire 4 years in school. They were just a toxic group of friends whose leader of the pack was a bizzarro feminist before it became popular. Most of the girls in the group weren't actually that bad, in girl next door way, or were cute but needs work sort of way. When they graduated the friend group stayed together, but they immediately kicked the leaders out of the group when they hit college (college town, most went to the local college) and had a completely normal college life of dating and getting a fiancé then marrying after graduating etc. The leaders? They found a group of college feminists and became the first generation of 250lbs dyed hair hambeast feminists.
There actually needs to be a class action lawsuit filed against this company.  They need to be ordered to tell every male in their system that they have been defamed and by whom.  Both need to be held accountable for damages.  Tell me an attorney's name and I'm in for a few bucks and I'm willing to help organize it.
men are not their problem, they themselves are.
I have no sympathy for people like this. It is 100% deserved. The existence of that app probably makes dating worse tho. Even less men will probably be will to take the risk now
We all know it.😂😂😂
This app could’ve been about actually calling out DV/abusers but they decided to limit it only to women which is so weird to me and shows what it was actually about initially. Honestly tho, I thought this was a psyop to showcase which gals were actually toxic and expose them after learning the app made you give your damn I.D. 😂 The age of Snapchat has ruined online self preservation, I honestly don’t feel bad they were outed but at the same time hating the “ofc the women complain/it’s empowering when they do it” memes because like….fam, don’t rope uterus havers with toxic women. These women want men to be subservient, I just want us all to be equal in everything (even call outs and rightful shaming from horrid actions…like making an account just to talk shit and dox a guy over nothing 🙊)
Women will do everything but be accountable, like my ex-wife who cheated on me while I was at work and sold half of my shit
The Karenocracy should invest in some coding skills instead of gender studies.
I can't help but notice that the pictures were all obese and kinda ugly, so basically the woman nobody wants is doing most of the defamation. So it's a coping site for ugly cows to drag down  the men they are rejected by.  Or there's some picture bias going on.
And Still! Woman have No Accountability  😅
Yeah, here's the thing: men are more intelligent & wittier. So, such a response was always going to happen
Well to all people that want to doxx others, don't dish it out if you can't take it.  There's a reason I don't doxx people myself.
I guesse that's the tea
Can we please report the app for facilitating doxxing, which is illegal?
It'd be the greatest irony if a woman who was the one who hacked and leaked it.
Any app that requires govt is not anonymous.
this is what they think we do lol its like man im tryna do some gardening make some steaks for dinner and go visit my auntie in the hospital
4CHAN LIVES! 4CHAN LIVES! 4CHAN LIVES!
They do realize ..they could have all been MASS Scammed? Omg 😭 I’d have charged them 5-10 each . Or a scammer could have took their entire info and been swiping all day. Stupid
Her hair is god awful
Tea is a great example as to why sites shouldn't want to deal with ID Verification. Data leaks can lead to them getting sued too.
So you fucked around and found out. You made up your own game, got played, and lost to your own rules that you made. RFK needs to ban all these hair dyes too. Something is happening to their brains.
I wonder what the red flags were that these women used when submitting men to this app? Has a stable job? Takes care of his mom who's battle with stage 4 cancer took everything out of her?   I've encountered more women that left guys with a stable job for a boy with no job and a rap sheet long has my arm. So rap sheet isn't a red flag. We know that.
Can someone make a site that says if a girl was on the tea app. I would pay money for this. I would like to avoid all those women
🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼 For all these female incels 😊
Gender switch that app and it becomes a crime against humanity.  The double standard is just disappointing at this point.
How would Tea avoid lawsuits from men were are being defamed on their platform? Seemed doomed from the start
how do I play this teaspill game lol?
i thought she was wearing a hat...
0:18 SUPER EARTH ANTHEM
Yo where is the pick one game yall sould play that live lmfao
Those are the "anti-fun" glasses, that's for sure. If you see those glasses or a septum ring on someone,  you can accurately predict their political position on 12 different unrelated issue's. The people who are always trying to subvert shit and claim to be nonconformist are the most progressively predictable people on the planet.
All this women suffer from coqnitive dissonance because they cant deal with reality
roasTEA
I'm sorry. but porn and the abuse of women selling off their beauty for fake money that is worth nothing is not right. They got dropped goose eggs on sour dough. :) Can't complain, I didn't create 4chan, I only own it. XD
All right fellas we need to create the Whiskey app.
So it's the men's fault as usual? Well, women will never say words like sorry, accountability or I will pay.
I don't think anything justify doxxing people or personal info, asmon said in the past similar yet he's glorifying it, hypocrite.
Ok I'm just BSing here but, the Tea app actually sounded like a trap from the beginning and the leak was the purpose the whole time. If so it's funny af and genius but, if not it's even more funny. But really the whole idea of the app sounded like an Intelligence check and they all rolled 1. Hive stupidity being it's own worst enemy again, masterpiece.
they want to leak men's personal info, so why is it so horrible when their personal info is leaked too?
So you're telling me that someone weaponized toxic womens' desire to gossip and lie and used it to gain a *vast* wardrobe of over hundreds of identities to steal whenever they want? Dayum
So now they know what a woman is.
[Sees GPS pins on map] That's a lot of ugly women!
Watch them say a man made the app
Lemme guess, the entire backend was coded in nodejs
Remember its not harassment when they’re doing it but if someone else is doing it then it is
You know... if these women would just lose 30 to 40 pounds. They wouldn't have to go on some app to hate men.
They been watching waaaay to much two and a half men! They had this way back when for Charlie
HAHAHA!
"No can have fun..." directly at the expense of possible innocent strangers and now they can't admit they were wrong.
4chan didnt leak it. The owner of the app did.
"All of that info got leaked"... The irony.. you were on a site that's intended purpose was leaking info about men without their consent. So boundaries and consent are important to YOU.. when it's for YOU.  Rules for thee but not for me.
This app sounds like a giant defamation lawsuit waiting to happen. How did apple App Store approve this?
So let me get this straight. You, a bunch of women, gave personal information of men who are not consenting, you share their info, pictures, and private matters that happened between you, without his consent or knowledge. It was all fine so far. Then your own data gets leaked, and you're upset? How the fucking turn tables lmao.  Classic case of rip bozo.
They left the bucket open. There wasn't even a security breach. It was literally a publicly open bucket
Wait you have to have an id to use it? I thought that was racist.
Wait American driving licenses have your weight and height on them? First off why? Second thats actually hilarious
Strangely, i have trouble caring about them. They had zero issue putting info about men out there.
Karma is a B!$#@
LMFAO, it gave them an ELO rank. Must suck being low elo. lmfao
pfffft. sumthin *I* NEVER had to worry about because l got a face like a fcukin mule and CANT GET  'DATE' WITH THESE superFACIAL wymyn. p.s. HA HA HA HA
THOSE GLASSES! - I thought it was the Haircut -
Guess someone spilled the tea
Nothing short of INGSOC's big brother will be enough for women to feel safe apparently. Perhaps we should help them by installing bubble wrap lined pods for them to remain safe in as they control drones to interact with the outside world safely. After all, safety is paramount.
I ❤❤❤ karma 😂😂😂 cant have anything 'fun'?? 😂😂😂 payback sucks 😂😂😂 They wanted to ruin good guys and now are leaked😂😂😂
Some will say, the “tea was spilt”
rules for thee not for me, you doing defamation against men is "fun"
so, imagine this happening to a feminist site, where photo IDs had to be used to use said site, and then a whole country deciding to make this practise law.
I love 4 Chan.
Beatifull to see
Also a prime example of the risks with the UK’s new age verification scheme.
My mom helped me infiltrate the app. I just give everyone a good rating.
The “No fun” glasses are strong with this one…specially if ur a wimmin
To a feminist 'safe' means she is in control.  If you thwart her having her way, you are hindering her from keeping herself safe, even if her way of making sure she feels like she's safe (because her feelings are the authoritative and objective articulation of reality) is utterly ruining your life, doing you physical harm, causing you to lose your job, rendering you a social pariah, taking your kids, treading upon your dignity, or robbing you of your civil liberties and property.
couldn't have happened at a better time, this perfectly illustrates why doxxing yourself to random websites is a terrible idea
Oh no, the app to ruin the lives of men backfired D:
“4chan intelligencia”
You don't name it "tea" when you want safety
I bet all they were saying false things about the men they wanted a chance with. Ruining their reputation so they can keep that man for them selves. Sounds right
you cant make this shit up the fater and nastier the more the complain......
Systematic hatred of men created by female incels.
It's sad bc some of these ppl could be somewhat attractive if they just tried a little. Instead, they sabotage themselves with colored hair, shaved head/cut bangs, face/ neck tattoos, and septum piercings
So the tea app is basically a list of female Democrats got it.
The harpoons - man them
You could be finding love instead of doxxing and letting them take space in your head. Don't give up hope and let anger make you this way. Turn to Jesus. 💪✝️
Love the rating game...How "Facebook" originally started...   I wanna play!
Funny how they look exactly like one would expect.
A coven of angry 1s and 2s psychopaths looking squidwards are angry people found out about them and their nonsense
Why is it always Whamen with hair that looks like an unsupervised toddler found a pair of scissors 😂
lot of ugly and homely women using that app........why am I not surprised...
0:15 No one is allowed to have fun on the Internet because of Karens like her. What, did she think she would stay above the rules forever? How stup!d does one have to be?
The app being full of unlikable hogs is the best part lol, who cares what their opinion on men are
Prank um john
I heat mapped the users in my state.   😂😅😊
in Germany we call this haircut "problem bangs" (problem-pony)
can this app be sued?
the fact that all those 'women' aka hippos even had men giving them a chance and then complaining about those men is astounding. they could have just said 'thanks for giving me a chance and some attention, sorry it didnt work out' and then be on their marry way. instead they needed an app to boost their ego at the cost of mens reputations, and then complain when it backfires on them 😂😂
Just last night I watched a video talking about "Why don't men approach us anymore? I'm out here looking beautiful and men aren't making the first move!"  This app. This app and many other reasons like this app are why. They did it to themselves.
Anyone else not even angry anymore? Just tired and disappointed.
Some of these women need to update the weight on there license
An app like that would not make sense if women were dating everybody. But since they all share the same few men, it's make sense to women to know what's on the menu. Like, if they are only 7 restaurants in your city, looking at rating (*****) and others people comment make sense. You want to know their experience.
I prefer the term "weaponized autism" for internet anarchists
oh no... the saars will know theirs location!
Weaponised autism always wins 🏆
They go out of their way to make themselves as ugly as possible it’s insane
It's hilarious how most of the top pictures on teaspill are just empty photos.
none of these people cared about being safe. they just hate men
what the FUCK is that hair?!
I want this editor to become our Champion
Very simple: if you got exposed through the app, you deserved it. Reality decided.
Where can we see the pictures/list? For our own protection. I don’t want to talk to any women that have used that app.
What is happening with her bangs, jaysus, why is this a thing
That womens hair is more messed up than her brain. 😂
SUPER EARTH ANTHEM
Those two chicks that are complaining, look like they each had someone staple a bad wig to their head.
I can't wait for 4chan to leak the Epstein files, that day will be hype
So they are mad because someone exposed them through an app that's sole purpose is to expose people. The level of jaded and hypocritical you  have to be to reach this level has to be considered a mental disability at this point...
My favorite part is the location data of users in uninhabited areas, including bodies of water.
Alerta de flequillo.
just looking at them makes me throw up in my mouth
My advice to everyone for whom this is making them hate the other side of the population: Talk to people as individuals. The gender war shit online is not at all representative of how people are in real life; the internet just magnifies and excacerbates divison and hate. Most people are pretty decent when you sit down with them and get to know them. Im scared for our future but we must realize we are all of the same cloth
Man this was one of the most brutal internet uno reverse cards ever played.
And....?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
yes .. i intentionally ruined the reputation of a person who didn't / doesn't know i did so .. but now it has consequences for me .. and THAT is not ok!
The TEA app was an IQ test, and now look at who failed. LMAO.
Poetic justice at its finest!
Responsibility, taking? No!
Fafo
Karma is a MF
Theory. Some scorned women got together, hired a MALE dev who saw a golden opportunity to help out the bros and told them to use Government issue photo ID's for verification purpouses as it's the gold standard. Knowing full well 4 chan would smell it and left the door open.
Where is the "would you rather" game? Was spill the tea taken down?
The tea app was a psyop to get a database of garbage thots to avoid and get them to submit their photos and personal info. 😁
Why do they cut their bangs like that every single time?
is her shirt supposed to look like a starbucks apron?
And this is why we need to push back on id / age verification on the internet. Once that information is out there, its out there.
female reddit users are upset their chatroom got leaked in a nutshell.
Dont help women, be the man they think you are
Elite 4chan hackers. They walked into a public server and found all the info lying around with no security lol
Just another reminder of why you should NEVER date liberal women.
Am i crazy or are the four pictures at the end the same exact woman??!!
That said, judging by the users profiles on this app, it's questionable whether they even had partners to steal data from. Their behavior seems incompatible with maintaining healthy relationships.
lower mid is being TOO generous, they make asmon and me look like henry cavill.
Guess ‘having fun on the internet’ means lying and insulting men online to these ugly wamen
0:59 anything less will not suffice🫡  I gotta get in on this one
So a bunch of miserable C U Next Tuesdays create an app to dox men they don't like (which I'm almost certain is some form of illegal) only to get doxed themselves in a magnificent twist of karmic justice.  Remember everybody! Karma's only a b1tch if you are!😂😂🤣🤣
please someone answer this question, why do all these entitled women always have the same ugly ahh bangs haircut??? i swear
The "i know my value" list
Looking at those pictures makes me yell, "OH, HELL NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
Imagine if the tea app was gender reversed
Hilarious 😂
If it was only about exposing guys who legitimately graped women or tried to or put something in their drink and stuff like that i would have been fine with it but it's so hard to know
link to the game ? asking for a friend
Hog app
How long was this thing running before it got btfo'd?
I’m not sure, but I think it’s illegal to take someone’s personal information that you don’t own and put it on a database without their consent or knowledge   Cpc’s?
Please 😂 have more info on this with pictures
womens hypocrisy knows no limits
Ewe 🤢 what guy had the unfortunate interaction with those things.
It’s like the force of nature. Everything balances out. ☯️
5,3 200lbs!?!?!? Hooolly fuck
These are some low-elo women right there
Ironically the most targeted and most affected men are the opposite of incels, men who have enough dating experience that they’re getting multiple comments and posts about them on the app.  The users of the app are genuinely closer to being incels than the men who are affected.
1:00 why do I hear helldivers music? My life for super Earth!
And most women that got leaked look like thumbs with hair.
I question whether this app and its users' actions are legal. These women posted their partners' personal data online without consent - a clear violation of data protection laws. Only the data subject can authorize such disclosures. Which prosecutor's office is investigating this??? It’s time for the FO part of FAFO thing.
Nobody's talking about my favorite part: there was no security because this was a piece of "vibe-coding" trash.  Which is to say, someone who doesn't know much about development asked an AI service to put it together for them.  Friendly reminder that AI only makes things that *_look_* like what you asked for; they have no concept of whether it is correct or even reasonable.
The orcs are mad again.
Nice bangs 🤮
Hilarious they're mad they got exposed for being bad people and immediately blame men.
These same women when they hit the wall in their 40’s: “why aren’t there any good men left?”  The highest growing demographic on anti depression medicine is middle aged women. 😂
Teaspill😅😅
5’6 182 lbs as a woman??? Start working out lady yikes
They're always the victim.  Just ask them.
Turns out, the Tea App was made by a gay man... and he didn't even bother to build the app user database with any degree of security. *ANYONE* could access it if they simply knew the URL that the database could be accessed from online.      Given the history of Bug Chasing (only look that up if and when you are not eating lunch or are okay with being scarred for life) being popular in the gay community, this is not a surprise.
And the UK wants us to dish out our ID’s willy nilly on the internet when you just wanna stroke one off cmon man make it make sense. It *surely* has nothing to do with starmers remarks on “catching those stirring things up online”
Accountability? Women? 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I'm all for women protecting themselves, but the idea of an app that anyone can say anything about you, and you have no way to know or defend yourself if it's untrue, is just WILD. I'm not said this app failed, or their info leaked. It's just karma.
What the narrator got wrong was it was WAY more than just one woman with a dod SPOUSE ID.
The tea app sounds like it was filled with "omg avoid this guy at all costs, he wouldn't date me cuz I wouldn't shave my armpits", or "this guy's a red flag, he didn't vote for Kamala"
The reverse of this - men gathering info on women into a database - is literally how Facebook started.
Wait a minute.......what is a woman?
Who cares about those glasses when her bangs are a war crime.
1:31 no shit they have ur exact coordinates u gave them it when signing up🤣
Technologia !!
Its honestly sad to see these women trying to find love at there age and weight. All this bashing man is there defensive measures, seeing truth requires courage and acceptance, breaking you own beliefs about yourself, someone who lived their life with such belief will get totally destroyed if they saw the reality
I got doxxed on there and "are we dating the same guy" fb page. It was awful.
Any woman who has those glasses and those bangs combo are 100% hypocritical, smug, awful human beings.
0:53 DOD employees are all trained on cybersecurity. This one seems to have missed the don’t give random apps your personal info seminar. No wonder we waste so much money every year
I'm not sure if the quote from Lord farquaad "it's disgusting!" Lives rent free in my head or if it's my mind naturally having a reaction. Probably both. So anyway yeah f these pigs
I got doxed on the doxing app im pissed 😂
This app sounds illegal as fuck what the hell? It actively doxxes people with them having no knowledge what so ever thats it's even happening
Hell yeah 😂
The woman speaking in that video, it's not the glasses, it's the haircut. I'm pretty sure those chopped-off bangs are a style designed specifically to be unattractive to men.
Looks at the HAIR of this BITCH
1:50 WHAT IN THE INGROWN TOE NAIL LOOKING AHS COW IS THAT
Bro weres the tea spill game at tho
They all look exactly how you would imagine
All those people were either at or above 200 Jesus h Christ
That’s a women? Looked like the bad guy from the first despicable me 😂😂😂😂😂
Brother, can you not put a disgusting orc in the thumbnail?
Love how asmon is immediately victimized when he sees women's glasses
Tea before: what men to stay away from. Tea now: what women to stay away from.
Honestly? Good.
1:28 WHAT KIND OF COW IS THAT
Tea is full of incel women. It was made for them.
I love 4chan almost as much as I hate 4chan. Long live 4chan.
What did all these women have in common?😂
''Gained access to'' is a bit of a stretch.   Everything was openly-accessible with URLs.
They're finding out that security and anonymous identity on the internets is a delusion. It's a falsehood that's been the narrative since the early 1990's. Time for 50% of our population to grow up.
Mission failed sucessfully
That’s a big yikes my guy 😂
Good God! That last one has the eyes of a second gen albinauric
These women were NOT dating the guys they had pictures of. No way. These 3's and 4's were not dating all the hot dudes they had names of.
Sorry but if these women are doxing you, YOU are 100% down bad 😂
What is THAT on the thumbnail? Like genuinely, who does that?
In a straight man's opinion, her bangs are atrocious. 0:03
You know who else is playing the floor is lava with taking accountability?? 😂😂😂
I'm reminded of The Lorax quote... 'That's a woman!?'
OOOooohhh, they were just tryin'a have fun....   HAHAHAhahahahahilarious...
what’s the tea, gurl? your sht got leaked?
"Didn't set up enough security measures so someone nasty could leak these images." ...uh yeah. That would be the _users_ of the app.
"a fun time on the internet"  Translation: gossiping about and almost certainly spreading lies about men behind their backs. Essentially just doxxing.
Nothing low t bout these hoes
Thousand of horrible women learning about cyber security in real time.
they put your weight on government issued ID's in the US?
Best moment of 2025
Oh boy more victims
Oh? Oh no, what happened!?
Can’t wait for the Netflix documentary.
So an app that was designed for women to talk sh*t about men and exchange personal information about these guys got hacked and now these b*tches are being exposed. This is the greatest example of poetic justice 👏
If you call someone an incel, you automatically lose an argument
Tea €unts
Tea appers getting tea bagged. Sweet sweet karma.
Them bangs tho. Or lack thereof
I thought I was tripping with the super earth anthem but then it got louder.
To be clear, there was *no* security on the database. Someone just found a url and typed it in, and that was it, full access. Not even a password.
defamation lawsuits inc.
Guys need to get much higher standards.  Because these hogs shouldnt be getting any sex at all
0:36 restricted from men?  Isn't that sexist?
They made a doxxing app, what did they expect???? No doxxing????
So an entire site dedicated solely for doxxing men. Brilliant idea stupid woman.
Drazzle-Drazzle!
4chan did the lord's work. can't wait on the internet historian's video on this.
the reality is nobody wants these ugly swarths on the internet. the internet is for intelligent folks.
these women are fdup.
"I knew it, I fuckin knew it bro"   Usual suspects...
Can't have fun violating men's privacy; women just can't do anything these days!
My great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Aloysius "Beaver-Smasher" Beaverton, sometime around the year 1608, I was told, once said this: "My good and fair [*coughs*] lady, should you choose to doxx the cocks the cocks shall then doxx the box. You got that shit, you 'gender studies' witch? Now, go fu*keth your broom, for it is the only wood your cobweb-ridden cooter shall ever ride!"  Truer words of wisdom than these I have yet to hear.
Jesus H Christ, those are the things calling people incels? /barf
We have test tubes.  We no longer need vaginas for the species to prevail.  We have 3D genetic printers. We no longer need vaginas so what is your worth now?  Remember even African usual suspect males rightfully had recognized rights by both Congress and the United States before caucasian females let alone the big bootie hos.
Maybe.... just maybe men are embarassed because they hooked up with these women. 😂
the lawsuits from all this are gonna be epic
A bunch of misandrists attacking men on an app get exposed and continue to blame men and be misandrists? Not shocked at all.
4CHAN IS BACK BABYYY
*"Why is my personal information being leaked to the public when all I'm trying to do is leak someone else's personal information to the public?!!!"* 😂
*Do as i say, not as i DO* women ahh mentality
eww yuk gross
And people ask why I completely stopped dating 😆👉 right there. That's why!  Women have lost the plot.  I'm just glad I got old before it really went to hell. Good luck boys cause... Ur f'ed.
So, is this for fun, or is this for women's safety? It cannot be both.
Bc glasses plus mental asylum bangs is the new crazy eyes
welcome to the internet and god damn it is great
You can have fun gossiping among your friends like a normal person. Bullshitting about people in public could destroy reputations
I’d like to be in on the meeting where the developers thought this was a good idea.  “lets create an app where we can be sued into the next life”
Leaking boats leak om
4chan, the heroes we don’t deserve, but sorely need.
No one is coming for these cows😂
aww poor ladies, now they must know how the Ashley Madison leak felt too back then.
gg femcel app
When you need to use personal identification with sensitive info like government issue ID, that should have been the first red flag. Anyone hearing that saw a big red target, with flashing neon signs and arrows pointing at this location.
They wanted to have a giant ugly mean girls cliche. Hard to feel sorry for them.
OK guys… what advice would you give your sister or daughter to avoid being suckered by a dangerous man? There are news stories all the time about women being beaten and killed by supposed boyfriends. . I’m not saying that I agree with this app, but I understand why it was created.
So what you're sayin' is that people don't like having their faces and personal information blasted on the internet because it makes them feel unsafe? ... weird.
if you are dating some girl, just try to confirm, if she is on tea app
Hahahahahaha
We got the hoglist, but can we get the epstein list
Bitter old ugly feminist undatable cat lady Karens ironically getting doxed in an app that they gleefully used to dox men?  KARMIC JUSTICE!!!  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
What is up with her hair helmet?
Let’s face it…. Whenever you see a woman’s weight on a driver’s license is 30 pounds lighter than it really is
Why is the Super Earth anthem playing in the background lol ?
Always the chopped ones
Why do they all have basically the same face shape?
They all look like they would do this 😮‍💨😭💀💀💀
Wait, what? Women only? What’s a woman??
0:57 that’s hella creative lmfao
what gives anyone the right to collect this type on information on anybody
In DCS is a 1 or a 0,  they have lame fix values, so when you go to idle it just goes to the minimum locking distance, btwn 500ft to 1000ft, and normally they are pretty easy to flare   Helis also have that lower value always on, so that's why they are so hard to hit with IR missiles   In DCS is like a super power 😂
0:53 Of course a glowie would be involved.
I miss your old titles that actually told us what we were about to watch :(
...why do you think it's intended to leak their info? That's kind of a weird assumption.
that teaspill game is brutal. there is no "none of these" button 💀
>women  >accountability  pick one
So busted women picking on men. Seems normal.
it's not the glasses she's wearing it's the bangs. It's called the Zuck and it's a mans cut
Tea Spill is going to have more active players than the latest Assassin's Creed.
I wonder why most of the userbase of this app seems to be so fat...
Im a woman and yea i have prpblems with spme men thay are stupid and gooners but i domt sign up for those shit cuz these things dpes nothing to change behaviors of some men. I just stay away. Ive met someone recently and he is adorable, funny and he aint rich (its not money that attracts me, its responsibility and loyalty) im a gamer girl and funny enough he is also a gamer which i love even more.
What is with people going out of their way to look disgusting?  The glasses, the nails, the hair, the attitude.  Who is it for?
TF did she do to her bangs🤣🤣
With those bangs!?!
There's a party in the USA right now, and men are the only guests invited.  The theme? Women. ☕️
So how was the app even allowed to be legal in the first place thats basically a app to stalk somone
Super nam was right. They're a mass self loathing narcissist cult.
Whoever created that Tinder-style swipe left-right thing with all the heifers was a GENIUS.
These harpies are insane.
Gonna make a male version and call it Caffeinated to see how they like it😂  (Edit: genius addition to it would be to allow women to sign up but when they look at men's information they get pinged to any of the men using the post or commenting😂)
A reminder that this is what the fat and ugly chicks do. The fit and got chicks that do the same are more sophisticated when they do do it. The minority of women that don't aren't either online ever or very long if that
How were these people running the app not getting sued for doxxing people?
the fatties are mad
"Someone nasty was able to access the app." Yourself included, right?
Not the Epstein list we wanted, but the Epstein list we needed
I think the tea app is actually good, these women are the ones you never want to ever date so if they talk about you on the app you dont have to worry about accidentally dating one of these hogs
Halleluyah
Women when bad things happen to them on the internet...   DUUUUUURRRRRRR
The 'tea spill' game is kinda funny.  The number one on the leaderboard is a pupper.  Number two is a computer mouse.  Number three is a can of soda.
never , i said never mess with 4chan. They did make the russian army bomb terrorist camps in syria and a littlegreen app never stood a chance.
Someone's gonna Sue the app company because it's a company that literally encourages defamation which is illegal.
Lovely turnabout. 😊
The media pages that cover the app leak keep saying the app got hacked.  The app didn't get hacked because all the data on the app was on public URL domain that anyone that knows where to look, could access as there was no security in place to prevent access to that information.
Those women just have to treat men the way THEY want to be treated, instead of framing themselves as victims again, because their toxic behavior got exposed.  "No one can have fun on the internet."  fun? doxing men is fun? sharing photos of them without their consent is fun? talking shit about them is fun? How toxic, narcisstic and misandric do you have to be to call that behavior fun!
They wanted to create a hit list but the second the hit list is on them, all of a sudden its bad lmfa00000
They're upset because their weight was doxed.
.. you know... there's a concept called "Too good to be true" these people really need to pay attention to. Did they really think this would go well? It's quite easy to attract these people to these sites/apps/etc without needing to say "oh we have no security for your data in which we don't automatically delete after verification" cause they tend to tunnel vision to when they say something they like and tend to outright ignore any red flags in the site/app that any sane person would nope out of.
You’re not even allowed to use that DOD id for any verification outside of the DOD. That’s against the DODs policy. Even as a DOE employee you can’t use your issued id anywhere outside of the DOE facilities so idk why she would use that there.
The fact that the app used odl or state identification as a verification procedure instead of video facial recognition verification demonstrates that this was probably a Honey trap
"somebody nasty leaked our info"... The goddamn hypocrisy is unfknreal
1:30 😂 tell me you are easily led by the nose…
So...I wonder if the DoD lady should be looked into to see if she was using government databases to dox men?
A classic example of "no accountability"
Why are there so many mentally ill people in America?
That hair and those glasses... Like, are they trying too look like the ugly girl from 2000s movies?
What is up with the jacked-up bangs? Looks more like a man repellent.
0:11 what great bangs. 😂
Two tier again
The only nasty ones were her and the rest of those women for thinking this was a normal and sensible approach to dating.
There is a reason “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,” was in the top 10 in the Bible. How many of these men who were accused of horrible things by bitter exes were actually guilty? The digital lynch mob doesn’t care.
payback is a b%tch
Tea-Baggin'  🤣🤘🍻💪😎
So these ladies doxxed some men and now they are complaining about their personal info being leaked? The power of equality.
Why are “tea” users some of the ugliest women around. I see why your guys left when you gotta a face only a mother could love. 😭🙏
SLAVA UKRAINI!!!                🇺🇦🎗🌻🔱🌎❤‍🩹‬‬
1:48 this woman looks like she was hit by a home alone trap That fire one that I think is in the second movie
Lesson learned…Never fw forchan
dem fringes btw
People need to realize that nothing you put on the internet is safe or secure
xD
Karma in real time lol. Love to see it.
You know for the women that were using the tea app it's probably in their best interest to shut up and move on and not call individual attention to  themselves.  But looks like some of them are incapable of doing that.
There's no GPS is 99% of the images. It was parsed from the licenses.
Nasty people used the spy app, like a bunch of retards😂
My thought is that the creator(s) of the app is/are pulling an UNO reverse on these chicks.
These women aren't dating men anyway. This was just a collection platform to catalogue overweight and ugly women.
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?
None of them were under 200 pounds. They lied on their license lol
We need a term for women who act like incels but obviously still can get laid cuz guys will bang anything they just won't always admit it 😂
Another thing, why aren't there apps for men only, so we can warn others about the crazy b's?
Those 200 pounds listed on the docs are all lies. Its like body counts for women. Always higher than what they try to profess. In this case those are all 250+ I promise.
Why no dating app lol
Who are these freaks and how is this being allowed to happen?
Everyone of these dating app bitches are disgusting. 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
The world is healing.
red flag bangs
Just another start up designed to get investors to make him rich so he can sell before all the defamation lawsuits flood in. Every evil entity in the world is waiting to use this to extort money from men who are accused with absolutely no required proof, just her opinion and feelings. Technology really is becoming garbage.
Women today are disgustingly primitive and rotten
Ah, the old "technology exposes the reality of things and incinerates long held errors" routine strikes again. Again and again tech is showing us how things actually are, vs. how we think or hope or assume they are. A woman can be every bit as toxic, nasty, selfish, cruel, you name it, as a man. The big question is, can human societies exist without a whole bunch of fairy tales about how women are all angels who can do no wrong? It's not looking good.
Fafo..or play stupid game la win stupid prizes. 😂
Oh no! Women who refuse to take accountability for their actions, blame men for literally everything, want everything handed to them, and are the most selfish creatures on the Earth had their abhorrent hypocritical behavior revealed for all to see?!?! NO WAY! How terrible!  Anyway.....
Thanks... women.
AAARHHH KNEW IT
You remember when it was common advice to not put your personal information and face on the internet?
4chan "inteligencia" 😂
>Create problem >Cry about problem >Play the victim >Blame it on men
Another HUGE win for The Manosphere!
so their idea of 'fun on the internet' is doxing, slandering and lying about men with no need to verify their claims and no way for these men to defend themselves? One might call that toxic
Never understimate the abilities of nerd incels...
Wait 4chan is back???
‘Women aren’t allowed to have fun on the internet’  Turning an App that was intended to warn women about abusers into a humiliation circle where you can make fun of men and call them gay cuz they didn’t want your crusty dusty self doesn’t exactly sound like fun ngl.  Its awful all their public information got leaked but low-key seeing how they all look tells me everything I need to know about that app ns
WTF is tea
Whoever did that bridge piercing's is crosseyed or something, they couldn't even line it up with the eyes . . .
She thinks slandering and quite possibly ruining men's lives is "fun on the internet".
This is absolute gold 😂😂😂
spill dot info dot gf
But that dude on the thumbnail 😂😂😂😂😂
bro....a website for women and the first one was still lying about the "200 lbs" she litterly larger than the one saying shes 260
That girl's hair is fucking horrendous.
Is this what is called, spilling the tea?
"4Chan Intelligencia" remains supreme
Tea App sounds like a scam to get pics and info from idiots. Looks like it worked.
What is with those bangs? Hole-E shit
When your bangers are 3” higher than normal… yeah I know what kind of person you are
The lack of self-awareness is strong in those pig dogs.
🥺 "someone leaked our info and pictures and gps on an app thats all about doxing men with their names, pictures, what city they live in, and probably all other info that would help others find them."
Id be surprised any of those horror shows dated men, more likely they just shit talk men they hate
If there was an app for men to do this... Women would file charges against them!
4-D Chess theory here. What if this app was created by a DUDE to PUROSFULLY do exactly what is going on? That would be amazing lol. All these women wanting to get men doxxed and trashed on not even knowing that it was a dude that created the app just to track them....
Lol , the leaked photos, not one good looking women among them, bet your ass thats their registration photo and their photos on the app they look amazing 😂😂
Imagine getting doxxed because you downloaded a doxxing app. LOL The Irony .....🤣
Loosers (womens) in this case got owned at their own game 😆
These people need to realize that they need to work on themselves the same way as everyone else in order to become "datable". You are not attractive the way god made you. God made you full of flaws so that your own freedom/escape from the matrix is a choice.
Rename the Tea app to Monsters Inc. please.
Not allowed to have fun on the internet? LIKE FEMINISTS HAVE BEEN DOING TO US FOR 40 YEARS?   Bwaa! Hahahaha! FAFO baby!
Its always the same chicks.
I could watch an hour long video of Asmon just saying 'king of the hill quips' while scrolling through thee 'people'
That website is amazing! The ELO system is hilarious
How stupid are you sheep your cheering for more freedom to be taken away. The palantir database says your bad. LMAO 🤣🤣 people are so brainwashed they actually still believe they live in a free country LMAO 🤣🤣
Why all of them looks like Miss Trunchbull?
I'm loving the fact these women are exactly who you would think they would be.
Just to really hammer the double standard in, can we make an equivalent app for men and see them all call it misogynistic too?
Can we please focus on the additional angle that is a company keeping all of your personal information getting compromised.  This is the problem with those new laws in the UK and the same shit US politicians are pushing.
It is our heart and the way that we treat each other that makes your beauty shine through. It’s in the smile on your face and the smile in your eyes that shows what we have in our hearts and soul. You all know what I mean. Kind loving people, when they smile have a warmth about them that you feel in your heart. That is beautiful.
The super earth national anthem made me laugh so hard.
I wonder if that one chick got a free bowl of soup with that haircut?
I love this so much. Women will never learn that they dont have the capacity to be as cunning as men. They are inferior in all categories except child rearing and dish cleaning.
That last one was a jumpscare lmfao
wait none of those men would even go for them, why are they on the app?
So this is what reddit mods look like
bowl in the front party in the back. WTF is up with that hair
YOU are too sad stop the hate and move to LOVE
I need a link to the game lol
"How dare you do to us what we were doing to you!!!"  Woman logic showing its face again.
What are those bangs
so Hot or Not is back but this time its Not or Mentally Ill?
big ups to whatever male developer just stuck literally everyones private information in a folder that could be navigated to through a url with no barriers lol
I am so proud that the internet just did a Uno reverse
And the heavyweight lineup is ......
Hahahahahahah 4 chan LETS GOOOOO
What does she mean.  We ARE having fun.  If the saying Karma is a bitch could be more appropriate.
What's with the dumb and dumber Jim Carrey haircuts?
Mentioned the glasses, but no mention of her jacked up bangs 😂. She obviously cut those things with some nail clippers or something.
the map is basically a version of the app they were revelling in so i really cant bring myself to care.
Hypocrites
5'3" @190lb shaped like a Oak tree stump 😂
lol bunch of goblin looking ladies.
I will say as a female glasses wearer, unless you can afford to go where you want slightly big glasses are the only option. Not the huge ones libs wear but large. I tried to find petite but only one local provider takes my insurance 😅
Notice how those weirdos all have the same ugly haircut? I will say this once and one time only, that haircut only ever looked good on ONE female and that is obviously Winona Ryder in Beetlegeuse.
Apparently the glasses are a pattern as well
How do we as men find out if we were hazed on the app without making an account and searching our own name?
These women are perfect models for Female Main characters in AAA western games
For me it's not the Glasses. It's the hair bang 💀 what is that. Not aeven vector has that bang
1:42" so head on swivel ladies".... wouldnt have to do that if u werent a garbage human being 😂
the tea spill game is absolutely diabolical
they hate incels but if they were men... theyd be incels
It wasn't hacked, whoever made the app was dangerously ignorant on how to safely store user credentials and should be sued for it.
Hahahhaha just cant make it up... is wild
0:09  "Fun time on the internet"  So, potentially ruining a man's life with rumors is "fun"? No wonder men avoiding women like the plague...
If they were an organization of wanna be Super Heroes, they would be called "The Unfckables"..  🤣
They all look exactly how i pictured them.
Men make up about 90% of IT, men know their way around software better than women, wtf did they think would happen?  Classic 4chan op
Another W for New types.
I dont see anything wrong with that apt. Just look at yelp. When people can post anything about anyone freely with no safeguards, everything works out fine.  It's not like that apt was designed for abusive practices. It's not like someone would ever get mad at a guy and just sh*t post him there.  Also, that lady is right; it is so much fun to post pictures and personal information about people online. I've never done it but thinking about it why wouldn't that be a fun time? Shame on everyone judging them!
Remember. It's fun to destroy someone else's life by gossiping. But only if you are a woman.
Now the whales cry victim,  after getting exposed and having their personal info leaked. Music to my ears.
As a man, can I just ask women... why do you guys cut your bangs off and crooked like that? Plus with that glasses combo you're trying to look like a lesbian batista,  I wasn't event thinking she was into dudes haha
I’m amazed they found actual dates to begin with
Tin foil hat theory: This was the original intention of the app.
This is wrong what the AI voice said There wasn't a "coordinated group" on 4chan. The people who made this app just saved all these images on some site that wasn't secured in any capacity. Which makes them the reason this all got leaked. Nothing got "hacked", not even a real exploit was used. I'd change that tbh
Hahah such a cow in librarian glasses.
Hacker known as 4chan strikes again
How funny would it be if men created an app to report on women? Bet that would fly like a lead balloon.
Good work lads
"No fun" if there was an app that did the exact opposite and it was just dudes doing it to women they would be losing their fucking minds
My first thoughts are you shouldn't dox them, then I remember what the app was about. and it made it to #1 by the way. Only a matter of time some innocent dude gets owned by some "influencer" on the app.
I'm loving every laugh, karma is a bitch.
Victims for fun what a life
Tea leak is hilarious
Type of women who would catfished you.
Okay, I just have to say: That first person in this video? I scrolled past a video about her on X yesterday. Am I the only one who didn't look closely enough and thought she was wearing a Starbucks apron and was posting an outrage video on the clock? Because, I just now realized it's a T-shirt with a green square on it...
Lol. Tea App fiasco is like the KKK getting raided by the FBI. And I wouldn't call those things 'ladies.'
You needed more credentials for this app than you need for voting in America.
Hog heaven
Auzwitz was not for the jews at all it was for tea app users according to 4chan
Pretty sure this is discrimination and men have a lawsuit on there hands
4chan doing the Lords work.
Her bangs look atrocious
I like how the leak just basically gave men a list of women to avoid lmao.
The super earth anthem in thy background is hilarious
>us department of defense >is a complete retard Stop fearing your government.
Goal post moving by biggest goal keepers
They really thought resurrecting Social Autopsy from Candace Owens, now for men, was a good idea.
"I'm going to trust all my personal information to a bunch of strangers on the internet just because they created an app so I can talk trash about men.." Leaks happen "All my personal info got leaked, its all the fault of those strangers that created the app, I have no responsability in this, I'm just a victim!"
Lmao, actually pretty genius.  >Launch an app where women "expose men".  >Ignore safety procedures for information of accounts... Nobody reads the TOS or EULA or whatever anyway, so who cares!  >Have an employee "hack" the system, and release the info, under the guise of an individual hacker, just half a moment after the app releases.  >UNO reverse card, Women get exposed instead!  And they're all swamp monsters too, with bad personalities, to nobody's surprise! Funniest 💩 that happened in the last few weeks!
This app will be dead within a few months if not weeks. This app should be considered illegal anyway.
Lmfao
An app designed with the singular purpose of doxxing people? ... I'm pretty sure doxxing is illegal. It sure as hell seems like it is given how serious it is taken.
Tea users are the sort that would never get a second date, so they turn to apps like Tea for revenge.
I have nothing against her glasses.
"no one can have fun on the internet" lol they weren't complaining when people got banned off of Twitter when people had a different opinion
its not the internet's fault for vibe coders carelessness and also the idea of uploading your ID
Stop cutting your bangs in the dark lol
You can’t convince me the Tea App wasn’t a big plan just to dox women at this point it’s too perfect of a scenario for it to play out this way.
So they're blaming men because a bunch of women voluntarily uploaded their identifying documents to an app designed to allow women to doxx men, that stored unencrypted data on a public firebase storage bucket?
There were no security measures.
"head on a swivel ladies" ladies.... lmao.
"we just wanted to dox men, how dare you dox us too, you disgusting evil people"
Why you got the Super Earth anthem playing? Lol
so they download this app to trash talk and dox the men who reject or dump them because they're ugly. Neato.
The app was 100% setup by men who just wanted legal info on a bunch of women. These women think they are smart when they probably gave their full legal identity to some perv
So its ok for them to stalk and dox people but its a problem when it happens to them? Hypocrisy at its finest
1:10 wait i thought responsibility being these womans krypronite was a meme? Use an app to doxx others, get doxxed yourself  and instead of realizing the irony of it and taking responsibility you blame the app for making what you did to others happen to you?
Damn, you'd think wahmens woulda learnt by now, after all the L's they've taken over the past decade or so... apparently, they're all "slow learners". *Tips my top hat* to 4chan.
All The girls that got doxed looked EXACTLY like i thought they would look like!
These chicks just made me go impotent!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Woman here. 1. Showing a couple of cherry picked photos isn’t a representation of all users on that app. Lots of women who posted themselves using the app don’t look like that. It also proves you are deliberately out to humiliate and harm women you don’t know. Exactly like the men who posted revenge porn and nude pics of their exes on the male Tea app. It got shut down in one day because men will break the law to hurt women. Just like the hackers of the app. Women don’t behave this way. Warning each other about dangerous men is for protection. That’s not doxxing. That’s called a wanted list, and law enforcement agencies do the same thing. If women were doing anything illegal on the app, it would’ve been shut down, but it wasn’t. Any man who has a problem with women wanting to protect themselves clearly has something wrong with them, and are likely not opposed to criminal activity themselves. Proving there is a need for the Tea app to exist. 2. I’m not a lawyer, but if those were leaked photos from a hack, showing them on your channel without permission might be illegal.  3. The few photos of the women depicted here are equivalent in attractiveness to the majority of male profiles on a dating app, no cap. Except the women were using those pics for ID purposes, not on profiles intended to “attract” someone, and they would have made themselves presentable on a profile. Men don’t have this for an excuse. Some men go out of their way to put ugly photos on their profiles, and then complain about their dating status, like children. Someone who is equivalent in attractiveness to those hacked photos criticizing them for being ugly is the pot calling the kettle black. Grow up.
Oh the irony xD
It's wild that basic internet protection concepts are already out the window. I rarely, if ever, use my real name. I separate business and hobby accounts. I never upload a picture of myself. I rarely mention details of my personal life. I never mention details that would give away where I live (like local restaurants). I leave as little connections to my full identity as possible. You gotta REALLY dig through databases to figure out my real name, face, and address and connect all of them together.  And this used to be normal practice.  Back in the day, a/s/l used to be the extent of information you would divulge to others outside of really specific contexts. And location was usually only as specific as a state or country. Now, people sign up and display their real name, exact locations, faces, gender and sexual preferences. All while being GPS tracked, posting images of dead give aways of their personal addresses, and then wonder how they're easily doxxed.
I think her hair stopped loading and got stuck at 76%
What if this was all one big scheme by some disgruntled dev and the leak was part of the plan
We found the female incels
You mentioned the glasses, how about that haircut? !!  It screams do not approach me or I'll falsely accuse you of grape!!
Women being hypocritical? Oh say it isn’t so, what do you mean the thing that has happens consistently throughout all of fucking time and every single society we have ever made STILL HAPPENS ALL THE TIME!? Ohhh mannnn I really thought women learned this time oh well I guess we have to wait another couple thousand years before they MIGHT POSSIBLY realize that they are in fact completely causing their own problems by being exactly like the “incel men” THEY hate with all their hearts   It’s like if a 400 pound guy is calling a 500 pound guy a fat ass, like while you are correct, bitch you’re fat too can’t you see it?
Can't imagine why those women are having a hard time finding a good man.
WTF WAS THAT SABER TOOTH NOSERING
Just name that app,  the unfuckables.  There,  I fixed it!
Found out...
h-t-t-p-s-:-/-/-s-p-i-l-l-.i-n-f-o-.-g-f   beep beep boop
That horrendous hair cut, avoid her at all cost Glasses and that disgusting Nose Ring🤮 you can spot these insane mentally ill child/woman a mile away.🤡💩
I was just about to start a diet and work out plan, but I’m very happy with my weight now that I see these heifers weigh significantly  more than me.
Crazy that democratic wemon cry about how Republicans want to take thier rights
Not the Helldivers theme in the BG. LOOOOOL
Not worse, better
The bigger the frames, the more unhinged!
This honestly sounds like 4chan created the app as a trap for women, and it worked. Weaponized autism.
Those bangs are a crime
I wonder why the tea leak isnt referred to as spilling the tea.
"Can't have fun... especially when you're a woman!" No. Having fun at someone else's expense always comes back around.
From the looks of it, it seems to me that a good majority of these women should be happy anyone would want to date them in the first place.
The fixation on groups of people you have strong emotions towards, labels are self ascribed which people tend to defend today, are probably not those responsible for the data leak…people that have 15 people rating them are not fixated on that rating on a website significantly enough to start a movement and ruin the entire identity of a group of people…those are state sponsored hackers.
😂😂😂😂 bruh… Karma.
Making derogatory comments anonymously about men only is considered "safety"? 😂
What's that? You posted a shitload of pictures and information of yourself on the internet?  Oh man!
All their data on the Tea App wasn't even encrypted. It was open to the public😂
So her reason for this doxxing app was to have 'fun' on the internet? tf?
LMAO, swing and a miss
It required a goverment issued ID 😂 I’m dying.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
do they not understand who was the first ones to call the internet their home?! bunch of nerdy dudes chilling in their dorms having fun. there were never safe spaces, only funny places
Just another gay, unhappy programmer trying to promote gender warfare and create more gays.
Now men have a database full of women to avoid at all costs.
"Somebody nasty" - no self awareness
"The Undatables"
All these women going: "Oh men are such savages! What are they going to do to me?! These ANIMALS! I just want to be safe 😩" They are all a bunch of late 30s fat women!  My sister in Christ!  Not a single man out there wants to hear your fat flops start making wet swamp ahh noises 2 minutes into the performance!  You are not on the menu! You are the one who orders the entire menu!
Turnabout is fair play, and karma is a bitch. These dames were so eager to out "bad guys" that they gave out all their own info in order to do so.   They're lucky driver's licenses don't list one's SS# anymore. I'm an old lady and I am still lucid enough to not post sensitive personal info on the internet.
The tea was spilled.
"Having fun" - a coordinated conspiracy to slander and libel men.
Is it me or all the women that was currently on the app are ugly af
The Helldivers music was a chef's kiss
Providing ID to use a website is the worst thing you can do. That's why I hate when people try to push legislation to "protect the children" from anything online, because it results in you needing ID to access shit online.
there's nothing safe about showing the net your id. women not being smart 101
Oh no the fattys are angry again 😂😂😂
ahhh yes a men harassment app nice
Let's be honest, there's NO men signing up to date them anyways. 🤢🤮
They're such hypocrites. Its okay to dox men but when it happens to the doxxers then it's misogyny and men are the incels. These women hate accountability. No surprise these women look exactly what you'd expect them to look like. 😂😂😂😂
Permavictim mentality
- Women dox men - Women get doxxed - Women most affected!
based Lain doxxing doxxers
We can't have hoe fax then you get no tea.
"Number 27 on trending for gaming"... huh?
Golden Rule reminder: Treat others how you want to be treated.  These women got karma'd
They all look EXACTLY like we expected 😂😂😂😂😂
This is just further evidence that real ID verification is a terrible idea.
It's always the unattractive easier women, who take it too personal.  You don't see hot attractive girls because there's always a new guy around the corner occupying their time and attention, almost immediately erasing the short memory of the previous dude
Of course they are fugglers.
Bunch of bitter 304s
What if the Tea app was actually in on it? What if they were never "hacked" they deliberately released all that information and pretend that they got hacked🤔
Down with the doxxers
The Teagate scandal
I love how NOBODY noticed most the photos of the dudes are STOCK PHOTOS. Leave it to gassed up mids in EVERY sense of that term to miss what is likely a very poorly run honeypot utilizing a botnet for its chat features.
Nice to see equality in action.
fun time= doxxing guys and making up stories about them
The Super Earth Anthem on the background makes it way better
Accountability and responsibility need to become main stream again.
Not being able to see the hypocrisy of an app like this is like next level narcissism.
They actually used their I.D. what idiots.
The moment 4chan turns on you, it's time to pack it up.
Insane national security issue too. Perfect blackmail material
Lefty women living in distorted realities getting reality checks once again
I think we're all just sick of being demonized for being human. Maybe when people stop going out of their way to look like demon slayers for denigrating people who live their lives withing the normal range of being human we'll be able to move past this virtue signaling nonsense.
4chan is back with a vengeance
1:03 My ears perked up and I initiated my Super Earth salute when I heard it.
I bet all the women on that app are LIBERALS !!!! Misery loves company !!!!
This is why people say that the government issued id usage to verify ages for sites is a bad idea.
OH wow only ugly women used an app that was designed to hate men. INTERESTING
1:40  Did anyone notice the weight seems off?
Those glasses are a HUGE red flag
"MY EYES!!!!" -That fish from Spongebob.
how much you want to bet my Ex Jennifer Jump Myers aka JMUHorn99 was a user of that app  she fits the physical demographic very well and the mental profile of the type of people on there ..  funniest thing is she supposedly is married now.. to i dont know who but i saw his picture .. he is my doppelganger like we look more alike than different ..
It’s good that men can safely stay away from these women now
Im sure everyone on the app was mature and stable enough to only doxx the really bad men, and not just use it as a form of revenge.
Shit like this makes me appreciate my wife of over 20 years so much more. The dating process has always sucked. Now there are apps to make it so much worse. I haven't had to deal with this for literal decades and it's fucking awesome.
An app created to avoid "red flag" men, created by red flags themselves.
Classic casual hater (Tea) vs competitive hater (4Chan) moment here.
You people just love to whine and gossip.
lmfao... the top of the leaderboard on teaspill is like a wall and a can of Dr Pepper, not even humans, plus a random guy up there .... and the bottom 50 is nightmare fuel.
I don't know what's wrong with America and american women. The fact that you had an app that allows defamation and in Europe basically breaking GDPR laws. Not to mention that in Finland this app would qualify for many crimes. Privacy laws, defamation etc.
The Slampig Coalition of Mopeds finally unionized?? 😯
The use of the Super Earth Anthem at 1:04 was diabolical
So a woman ive never met, talked trash about me online, preventing the dates I go out with from accepting a second date... seems like im dodging bullets here. I don't want my wife using apps like that.
Women us an app to dox mens entire livelyhoods on the vague basis of them being a "red flag"  Women affected most, somehow
Accountability wins for the bajillionth time against women
1:00 music flag raising from Helldivers 2.
Which app? Why should I care for some app full of lgbtqrxyw+++ shes and hims and its?
Women: *destroy social traditions and mechanisms designed to keep women safe* Women: "We feel unsafe"
I heard karma karma not my fault blah blah 😂
all of the sudden i swear i smell cat piss and unwashed azz looking at these pics...
For super earth!
All those women need to get laid
Seems like an app for Karens.
Bunch of land whales and Orcs 🤣👌🏻
Accountability.  Women's kryptonite since the Garden of Eden.
Alerta de flequillo
dude .. who wears bangs like that ?  only 4 year olds that gave themselves a hair cut  and mentally ill people who think they look like Betty Paige ...or Audrey Hepburn
women - the source of all our drama
Femcel: the incels are at it again.
All women you wouldn't wanna f#@$ in the first place 😂
Ohhhh, they were just having FUN, well gosh now I feel bad.
lol fucken gross.
4chan saving the world, once again.
The Helldivers 2 morale music mid-video is simply classic.
Her: "Heads on a swivel ladies!" Men: "Thats a HUGE B***H!"
this is kind of like when the feds ran that  site to catch pdf files, except it's probably women catching other women in this case. well wait a second then...
If men made the same app to rate women they'll be all butthurt being treated like products. 🙄  Hypocrites. The modern woman.
so are these the female versions of incels? seems like it.
You... You are the ones who are nasty, you already doxxed people but can't handle being doxxed, if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.
AMERICAN Women look like Ogres lmao 😂
Wow, the force is extremly strong it seems with the femcel
These are the women who want you to be at least 6ft but you ask their weight and its a problem lmao. I'm over 6ft i just don't like whales
I heard the super earth national anthem you can’t fool me
Well, made a list of undatable burgers
There is a difference between having a fun time on the internet and putting hits out on innocent men just because you feel like they could be a “bad guy” let’s not sugarcoat it we all know what a lot of these false accusations really are and so don’t they. 0:17
4Chan, not the heroes we deserved but the heroes we needed. 🤣
Huh feminists doxxed themselves who would had guessed they continue to set women backwards centuries
if there was a body count tracking app they would go mental.
Playing around with the ranking site is one of the most fun I had today compared to all of last week. It was so fun seeing a staircase, a dog, a Dr. Pepper, a keyboard fighting for top 3.
Them: We need to dox for our collective protection Also them: Doxxing us put our safety at risk
This proves the biggest flaw with makeing porn sites collect Government IDs
4chan is like the supreme, governing overwatchers, of the internet universe. It’s incredible.
If all you have to do to gain access, is be a woman, and hundreds of thousands of guy's have sisters who OF COURSE will give access to TEA for fun to their brothers. A LOT of women would choose their own brother over hardline extreme feminists. Thinking "team woman" is a thing was a HUGE mistake. Any guy with a good relationship with a female in his own family or friends group can get in and see it all.
Something I've learned over the years of the internet never never piss off question try to stop 4chan it is the sleeping bear of the internet 😂
They should have called that app 4minus.
What if the creators of the app are the ones that “hacked” it, and what they wanted is to expose these “incel women” so that guys can avoid them (not that they wouldn’t have, just based on the average looks)?  The uno reverse card of the uno reverse card of the uno reverse card 😂
Karma is beautiful.
It's utterly sickening at the lack of accountability in the women that keep making these videos complaining about this. The sheer hypocrisy displayed. Like,,, how in the hell do you even manage to get by day to day with that big of blinders on without walking off the edge of a cliff?
I love happy endings
The app literally allows women to dox men and they are angry that they themselves were doxxed?
That app breaks a number of laws. Its creators need to be sued into oblivion, and it needs to be shut down.
THIS is poetic justice! 🤣
dat random helldiver theme crack me FOR DEMOCRACY!! HA HAHAHAHA HAAAAAAAA
I dont give a damn when I appear on that app lmfao
We are all liberal women starting to look like homeless creatures?
WOW....all of a sudden they can tell what a woman is.
This was as much of a HACK as me downloading a jpeg off google.
The chick on the front page of this video looks like if Mr gold were to badly cross dress and get hit in the face with shrapnel
All of those Gorlocks and Snorlaxes are unfuggable!!
Bunch of whales got leaked😭🥀🥀
I've only seen hogs and Karen's speaking out about this lol. The target audience of the app.
Typical female response when they’re forced to stop gender-based harassment and doxxing
Karma GOLD .. Here Darwin. .. Here boy...or ... Here GIrl....
oh man this is FANTASTIC!
Hilarious. I love it.
That's me too!  Involuntary celibate.  I just want to find a nice woman who wants to be a wife and mother.  It's like finding a unicorn of unicorns out there.
The Tea app also seems to be over 99% leftist women lmao
Fun fact you can look up:  The group with the largest average bicep circumference in the US is women in their 30s.  Fat-ceps of peace.  I don't know why, but obese women carry a lot of fat in their upper arms for some reason.
If libel (slander is oral, libel is written defamation) could be an app. I've been to dates where I've acted cold and I've been on dates where I acted warm. Depends on the woman. If she acts like a lady she gets the me-version of me. If she acts like a hoe she gets the cold version of me. I'm guessing the ones that gets the cold shoulder would be the ones to go whine on an app while the others wouldn't. Like how often do you take your time and go to any site to rate something positive? Most people like to give negative reviews because they want to vent their anger. Also, if you think some guy is awesome and want a second date, WHY would you go into the app and give him green flags? You'd only create competition for yourself. In fact, woman should fake red-flag the shit out of their partners so no other woman would want them. This is organized defamation and should be treated as such. Sue them for libel. If you are on the app, make them apologize and pay you back for mental and emotional anguish. Make the whole company go bankrupt. Make them realize there are laws about this shit.
Dude!!  Those numbers of their weight and height, lmao. Thank god my wife is at 110 lbs at 5" 4'.
Nothing on the internet is secure. There is some real eye opening stuff there.
SO fucking funny how they all have the same "LOOK" lolll
you know... would be really crazy if they made you ID yourself anticipating something like this would get hacked and leaked... like... way to bait all the Karens into one spot lmao
What sucks is she has a b-52 poster in the background and it makes me want to talk to her, but I now know it’s a trap :[
I have an aunt that has those glasses 😂
Wing glasses - Karen in training.
That this app got through the T&C's required to publish an app on Apple or Play stores is beyond me? So we care about our own data, but it's fine to slander and smear males specifically, and add, without permission, their pictures to your shitty app?! And let's face it, that's what this tea app is, utter fucking garbage.
I want to make it very clear to people, almost none of whom need to read it are here, but maybe you can spread the message; This was not some targeted hack by the hacker known as 4-chan, it was an unsecured cloud storage bucket that was picked up by a standard scrapper. Lots of different groups do this stuff all the time to see if they can get any information they can profit off of, obviously this time they thought it was funny so released it for free, but no one is "attacking you" or your app.
Um What men did these abominations have any kind of contact with
"wait, you did The Exact Same Thing I Did?? You must hate the opposite sex you misogynist!" is a level of projection you only used to see in old cartoons. these people have real difficulty seeing the world from other people's perspectives in their minds. every accusation they make is simply them admitting their motives when They did it first. and the fact that they are seemingly incapable of seeing this perspective is Very Very funny.   they believe men hate women, because They hate men.   they believe men have a patriarchy because when They have control, they have a matriarchy.   they believe women are oppressed because they would oppress men.   they believe men who have standards are insecure, because their dating standards stem from insecurity.   This is how a sociopath views the world.
So this APP got hacked and users doxxed due to needing ID to get in. Now in UK you need ID for adult content so just like Tea you will be putting yourself in massive Danger in the UK by putting your face or ID because they will store your info and that info can get hacked and sold in the dark web or some other shit.   Like my bro ending up in the dark web's hosted stolen ID marketplace is not good. They know where you live now and that is extremely dangerous for your kids and adults. All of this just wanting to watch porn.  Hahaha! These UK people if they don't use a VPN they are gonna get a knock on their door and it will be a Russian cannibal named Igor with a pet Goat who just bought their stolen ID with crypto on the deep web for 12$. 💀💀😭  Igor tells them: "Come here my little morsel. Just a little taste. The toes first."
they all originally signed up thinking it was a food app.
They are allergic to accountability. Karma is real in this instance
If their equivalent of fun is doxxing people then there's something seriously wrong with modern women
Can I mention that they all weight around 200 lbs? 1:45 XD
Women in 2025 are the most insufferable creatures of all.
It's not the glasses, Asmon, it's the bangs.
4chan is back baby! Hacking shit, trolling karens!
I thought I heard some angry oinking in the distance….
I wish I was gay. Maybe then I could find a partner who will take accountability for their actions and communicate.
Oh no the feminists are mad that they got out doxxed
The app features their weight.
Why are ugly women mad at men? Men didn’t mean you ugly and men sure as hell didn’t intentionally make you look uglier. Imagine thinking men don’t like you but you do everything possible to repulse them.
You see those glasses, the last thing she wants is for anyone to have fun. LMAO
I honestly hope this goes even further before the law steps in. This is such good tea.
Neither of those "women" are into men anyways. Why do they care?
Very little makes me more grateful for my 24-year marriage than witnessing such idiocy/ hypocrisy, as demonstrated in this video. Very little also makes me more grateful than having been born in the '70s, so that I wasn't raised with "'social' media.
Don't women know that nose rings are for FARM ANIMALS? 😅
look at all those 3-4's thinking they deserve anything..
These women don't realize how bitter they have become over time and when they get together in a group on an app like that it just serves to normalize and validate their bitterness. If you are worried about "bad actors" on a dating site one way to avoid it entirely is to get into some decent shape so men would find you attractive. 260lb is your problem, not shady male singles.
how is this app even legal, if the roles are reversed if men rated women red flagged them give their locations etc there would be an uproar
Funniest thing is, nothing will come of their info being leaked just ridicule 😂
Why does every single one of these losers have a thousand tattoos and piercings and dumb hair?
It wasn't that the app wasn't secure or didn't set up security measures. They weren't even really hacked. They just had all their user info in a public bucket and none of it ever got removed 😂
oohh her she comes....she's a manhater
WT*F* thinks a piercing in the bridge of the nose looks ‘good’?
So, those are the types of women who could be looking up info about me on an app and then deciding not to date me based on that info? Kind of makes me want to create a fake profile and spread terrible rumors about myself just to keep them at bay.
Whales
Woman complaining about not allowed to have fun on internet after women just banned a bunch of games, trying to get anime banned, even shut down a manga book store and went after a bakery for funny motto.
Hey so the femcels are at it again
Lol Femcels calling out Incels lol
When you fuck around with the Internet Hate Machine, you find out.
Reminds me of the game Fable where the more of certain decisions and actions actually changes your character appearance, in this case the more spiteful and scornful a woman becomes the more hideous and outrageous they seem to look in real life lol
Liberals are losers.
Women that no sane man wants to fuck are so mad at men for not wanting to fuck them that they willingly and gleefully choose to offer up all of their personal information to some random-ass app designed to openly and brazenly dox those men who do not want to fuck them, only to end up being openly and brazenly doxxed themselves, and are big mad about it because Muh Patriarchy (TM) or something. Yeah, that sounds about right.
Aww common you could have at least linked the TeaSpill site in the description! 😂😂
Nothing is ever their fault, and they gaslight you by saying “misogyny”.
why is it always the ugly ones that do this stupid shit like i even could seen this coming its a app that held info and pretty much gathering info on someone so its okay for women to be creeps got it and then if this did work out then what every guy be on this with dont date because red flag selfie pictures or he eats food even worse women could even try to cause harm and know where the guy would have lived by all the info they would gathered you know go on a date or two go back the the house then boom every woman then knows who to pick on because the app placed info of the address the car the job he go to like this world just turned sickening and happened so fast to me i am not saying all but a big percent of women cause the problems we have today and they dont listen of what guys or even what they same they hear shit and go with it. They want guys to go back to be the first to start something but then question why they dont anymore then say stupid stuff like i can do better why you talking to me shit like that.
0:17 the glasses, but also the shtty haircut😂
"No one can have fun time" Your doxxing men to either avoid, harrass, or get dicked down by, not actually make relationships with... you just made a sight for a male public escort service...
For all those wondering, these are what chicks from Portland Oregon look like.
mad when the very things they tried to push on the opposite happens to them 1 for 1.... i sometimes hate that i share the same sex as these idiots
Cancerous femininity.
"Apparently that sh*t was not secure" – no kidding! If you don't come to that conclusion after reading the privacy policy and seeing that such a platform requires you to enter various kinds of sensible data, I can't help you, nor would I ever be willing to try
Once something gets uploaded to the world wide web, it will float around forever, that's how AI generates art, all of the media online. Nothing is safe once it's on the net, even personal data. A hacker or AI has access to anything, even firewalls and VPN is not 100 % because of Cia.
no way they did the mark zuckerberg thing lol
They done “got .. got”
"I'm still a 10/10 tho."  /260 fking pounds? Holy shite. Who is that fluffy and female? That's a lot of got-dang fluffiness considering women don't carry as much muscle mass as men.
I'd pay an absurd amount of fucking money to see what was written about me
" noone can have fun on the internet" Defamation and doxxing isnt a form of fun. its harassment. This is just more of the same from the same ol' people.
The data leak should be called Tea Spill
its wild cause they make it out like they were not 100% just shitting on, defaming these dudes full on doxxing them instead trying to act like they were trying to "stay safe" like all the dudes on there are sexual predators that just haven't been convicted yet, they were probably just burned by the guy on a dating app and decided they wanted to damage his reputation and chances of meeting a girl by dogging on him on the app.
4 chan didnt leak it though, they just made people aware its all public info.
At least courtesans would feed you, sing to you, and kick your ass at chess.
When your bangs are on point! lol!
The fact this app requires so much info and several thousands of women agreed to such requirements without questioning it makes my faith in them so much worse. Hell I'm gonna go ahead and say this "app" was actually made by 4chan or some other type of troll site just to see how many women would be stupid enough to self report themselves to the fullest extent. Eventually when they got enough "data", they "leaked" it for all to see for what was suppose to be a "dating app to doxx men". With that said, this totally fits 4chan narrative since 4chan messes with everyone be it man, woman,  or whatever since their highest priorities is to troll as many people as possible and spreading chaos.
No attractive women were harmed in this incident.
The true purpose of this app: "You think Taylor Swift is mediocre? I'm going to tell everyone you're a rapist."  All this is is a weapon for misandrists.
Guarantee it was a honey pot app this is working too well
damn someone pulled an UNO on them! lol
The Jealous fatties are ruining it for the hotties.
These are the women calling men incels! 💀🤣
5'3" 200 she got MASS
Built like Blastoise. Face like a curtain rod.
Bruh they used Firebase as a production DB what were they expecting?
They are literally worse than incels and they use that word with so much hatred lmao
Sharia law is correct. Women do not deserve rights and freedoms. It has done absolutely nothing but degrade civilization.
"It's about safety!"  Felony and arrest records are public information and are easily accessible.  Edit: Also, hilariously, it wasn't even a hack apparently, cuz all of the stuff was completely unsecured and was just on the publically available internet.
I find it surprising that in some states people are so stupid they need the year of becoming 21 to be printed on driver's license explicitly.
These people are also incels and should be regarded as such. Also this app was apparently never available in Europe, probably because its entire business model is one massive GDPR violation. It's crazy that it was even legal to operate this.
If libel is an actionable form of defamation, and all of the information about the men has been leaked, don't they all have a case against their accusers?
Pretty much what we all thought. Largest group of low value women since the last Taylor Swift concert….
they all look like Discord Mods in Female Version
the original Tea app can still be sued for doxing and stalking. class action that app and bring its creators to ruin
Fat girls getting no dates and mad about it........who would have guessed
so basically it was a farm game where you can show off your prized hogs like on a farmers market?
god damn
Why do all the women weigh more than men?
Why do they all have the same hairline
My ex wife’s friends look like these people
1:29  the least insane Tea app user.
spill dot info dot gf - if, like me, you immediately wanted to go play the game.
What kind of an idiot do you have to be to send such sensitive information about yourself to a random app. Fucking government databases are hacked on a regular basis, you have to be a dumbass fucking bitch to expect a random app on the internet would be impervious. People are so fucking stupid.
Damn all those woke women
Her bangs are mesmerizing in their audacity.
Fugo bitches.
Being doxxed for doxxing ouch 🤣
They are just going on that app to lie about men they don't like. They know it too.
“No one can have fun on the internet”  No, no this is pretty fun. It’s just equal fun now.
Amazing editor with the super earth anthem
Im really not on board with saving the whales movement.  I really dont believe they are THAT endangered that we should be protecting them.
Honestly the tactile thing to do would have been don't make a video you were one of those chicks 😂 idk I can't tell most people in real life from a photo. There's just too many people around they could have stayed somewhat anonymous.  The entire this was a questionable thing to do.
No More Fun, they think making up crap about guys and Doxxing them is fun.
Am I the only one that's lowkey proud of myself for never even hearing of this app until the "scandal" came out?😅
The TEA leak is absolutely huge. It's way bigger than most people even know. Wait until the blackmailing starts. With everything being public. There will be database websites for people to take this information, cross ref it with other shit and start blackmailing people. People talking about their partners, ex's, whatever, spreading lies, even truths, itll all be used against them. I feel bad for the women at the same time as karma is winding up a bat. :\ its gunna be bad.
Oh noooo the Discriminatory doxxing app got leaked, oh no... anyways
These women are invisible to most men anyway.  How did they even "interact" with a man? "He wanted extra cheese on his burger, my soggy knee!!!!!"
How ironic the men haters at tealeaf making a list of undatable men got a list of undateable woman made from their own website leaks instead by the internet how ironic and depressing that is good job ladies mission accomplished I hope you can find the desirable men you want that makes your high standards someday and our able to create the future you want to craft for yourselves take i personally as a single man wanting a girlfriend searching online can't find one due to financial reasons wish you lovely beautiful ladles nothing but the best that you get everything you are entitled to and more may you meet the desired outcome we both know is coming for you and thanks for creating and being part tealeaf it really helps me find and sort though my potential dates without ever meeting you thanks I appreciate it also if anyone can help me how can I  find a girlfriend  online or in person when I earn under  40k a year that would be great I swear unless you earn 6 figures a year aren't even given a chance as a man I'm so sick of society judging me and deciding my worth as a person by my income and job tittle let me give you some advice woman you need to lower your standards you want equal rights as men great you got it now you get to work in jobs as hard as men congratulations we are now equal now you want a man to go to work and somehow earn enough to pay the bills and take care of you financially and be the perfect husband doing all the work at home too not gonna happen im going to tell you a secret if you want to find a man you have to make a choice between good poor semi broke men like me who will treat you with respect dignity and love you for who you are as a person and help you out at home share the cooking and cleaning and go to work  with you or do you want the rich man who makes more then enough money so tou don't have to work takes care of your bills but because he does he is a jerk at home who married you for your physical beauty and abuses you emotionally   mentally and other ways because you don't contribute financially so  you have to contribute at home if you refuse the man you fell in love with is going to start losing feelings for you and eventually find someone more physically appealing than you cheat on you and broke your heart basically woman do you want a rich bad man who often became weathy doing bad things a good broke man who's broke by being good person following the rules of society make your choice ladies finally im sorry for the rant and long comments about this alot of dates i went on over the years  and alot of my ex girlfriends have aways ended the same way you love me for my money and as soon as we have financial problems which you create by not contributing or as soon as you find someone richer then you you cheat on me and break my heart this is a common thing rich bad men abusing woman and bad woman who only go out with you and love you untill times get tough then they leave you im so disappointed in how love has devolved like this into love transactions what happened to stand by each other for better or worse in a relationship and became built around money like everything else im sick of it again sorry for the rant i just broke up with my girlfriend recently 2 weeks ago and we broke up couse i wasn't again earning enough  for her story of my life and im almost 40 i doubt i have much longer to find true love the dating market sucks so much again sorry for the  long emotional rant im having im doing this for stress relief typing my feelings online in random videos makes me feel better and yes ladies man have emotions too we are just tought to suppress them instead of express them couse it isn't considered masculine in male culture or socially and ladies who may read this if you want a broke but emotionally healthy guy and want to be an equal with me contact me im not perfect but neither our you thanks for reading i feel better venting like this
I mean its always the women that nobody wants to date nice self report btw.
In other words women want no consequences for defaming men?  Got it.
finaly some good news
Calling bullshit on the ID being required. All they need is to see the nose ring and the haircut that looks like you lost a bet.
They are not ugly horrible leftovers with personalty disorders, oh no they are strong independent queens that need no man. They are single by choice yet do nothing except crawl dating sites and empty single's nights and talk smack about guys for not wanting/begging them or treating them like the goddesses they so deserve as the humble solid 10's they are in their own degenerate and delusional minds.
Woke Goggles are a strong indicator of both wokecraft and douchebaggery - 97%.   Only Face Staples are stronger at 99.7%
Why is the WGT on the ID? Why does the government need to know how much it is?  Is it for the police, so they know which car they need and they can't get sued like lyft? Or does the government provides a service to find partners based on your preferences and filters the others out?
She calls people incels yet has an edna fringe and a combinatoin of the fairy godmother and rof from monsters inc glasses, not even mentioning her personality because lets face it if shes on a misandrist doxxing app then you know shes a female incel.  Theres no way she isnt an incel too.  Nobody sober would bed that.
Calling men "incels" from a bunch of "fat cells"
Hog logic at its finest.
Women have gossiped about guys since the dawn of time, but there's a distinct line between gossip and doxxing (especially without knowledge nor consent).  To those who doxxed the app users: THANK YOU!  To the user who worked for the DoD (and used her CAC for her ID):  HR and Security Forces have been notified, you are FIRED, and you are going to FEDERAL PRISON for leaking Classified Identification online!
AHH FUKKEN KNEW IT BRO
When someone said 100 women vs accountability during the gorilla meme thing that was the most real shit ever And we all know the woman ain't gunna win that one
Group of women dox men. Women most effected. LOL
Oh no! Tastes like their own medicine!!
Those women If you can call them that, either are delusional or need a new mirror and bathroom scale that doesn't lie to them. There isnt enough alcohol on this planet to drink that pretty.
Tldr - dumb bitches gonna get blackmailed by Intel agencies.  Aside from the karmic fun, there is a national security issue thanks to these dumb women. How many of these women used military ID for verification? That's a felony by the way. How many of these images and accounts can be associated with important people, ranks, and locations in government? Intel agencies around the world couldn't find a juicier meal in a damn steakhouse. The women associated with these accounts and the people associated with these women are now all security risks. Had a job in government with a clearance? Not if any of the women on here said anything about you.
we have so many quest markers
Gotta love that Schadenfreude!
why she look like the chick from bobs burgers?
This proves some guys will screw anything.
So a site for unfuckable women that hate men had terrible security. HAAAA!!!!
"ladys cant have fun on the internet"....gossipin and doxxing people on the app is fun to you? you eat babys, definetly.  they act like each woman on this app got  r*ped over 15 times.....they got PTSD from other women, that had bad experiance with men. its insane. THEY are insane. thats pure sexism, if you "feel" like every guy just wants to f*ck you, even though your hairline is worse then KSI's and your glasses scream "pick me, im to stupid to understand basic human connections, but i wear smart glasses, that i found in a lost-n-found bin in 1972"
my mother always used to tell me "Play with fire you'll get burned".
Women definition of 'fun on the internet' is Posting photos of non-consenting men, and adding libel on their name? 💀
Didnt Candace owens already try and fail with something like this?
i thought this app was for men that these women would potentially date. none of them look like a man has touched them. ever.
Why are they always so extremely unattractive?
I thought the pictures were all the same woman...
Guys already have hard enough time finding a semi decent women and are fighting over the scraps left over as it is and these girls think that guys need to be punished it's crazy
lol they all look like shit
Light work for anon.
Oh wow, i thought these women were just  trashing men but theyve been sharing their private addresses and shit with eachother on that app? Thats fucked
THE GLASSES?!? WHAT ABOUT THE FUCKING HAIRLINE/BANGS!!?
these people cannot talk without blueprint sentences and buzzwords ? like are they incapable of forming brand new sentences like they are incapable of loosing weight ?
how can someone cut there bangs like that and like it?!?!?!??!?!?!
All these women fed an app all their personal information just to bitch about men instead of going to therapy
So they wanted to destroy men from a position of anonymity....and ended up getting destroyed.  Wonderful work 4chan.
The irony is clearly wasted. Because “cannot do accountability”
there's an army of fat women trying to stop all of us regular people from dating and having fun, we must stop these hippos at all cost
If men had an application like this, women would be even more furious. The application could be called "Bullet Dodged".
Oh no! Anyway 😂
they are all 5'2" 190+ lol
Typical... ZERO Accountability for their Actions
Another 4chan w
This is an easy self report. If a woman is using this app, no reasonable man is going to want to spend time with her.
"It's the site's fault for not securing the data."  ...it's your fault for giving someone your ID and thinking it would be safe.
So nothing of importance was leaked
Who could have so much h8 in their heart to fall for this kind of hustle. This is as bad as that scam where people were going to Chase ATMs and taking $9K cash out on a glitch. What I can't believe is bangin' some of these people. I wanna see the dudes! 🤣🤣🤣
The glasses say "i might be a b*tch" the bangs say "i am" 😅
We need a women body count app, so you know which number you are, when meeting her.🤣
Every one of them is what you would expect if there a thing called karencon...
Perfect use case of why requiring an id to access certain sites on the internet is a HORRIBLE idea lol
More like [The Hog App].
These "women" look exactly like you'd think they look like. 😂
btw to them, fun time=talking trash about men But when they are the subject of trash talking, it's harassment.
Hahaha these things dont look like women nor do those look like human beings.
4chan STANDS
A lot of repulsive ppl….
I love how the women who use the Tea App call men incels. But I know for a100% certainty if they were men they'd be the biggest incels ever.
Looks like she got her haircut style, from one of those "I just fawked my bangs, trying to cut them in the mirror myself" videos.......
lmao good one uno reverse
Man, that’s tough. Do what I do, just don’t date then you can never end up on an app. 😂
Important to separate what the Tea app was designed to be vs. what it became. It pitched itself as a safety tool for women—reverse image searches, background checks, anonymous advice—all meant to help spot red flags in dating. But without guardrails, it slid fast into a toxic whisper network, and the security breach proved how reckless the execution was. Calling it a ‘catalog to expose men’ skips the part where it pretended to be protective. It didn’t start evil—it just failed hard and fast.
this shit sounds super illegal.
Yet another time 4chan proves they are the real superheroes doing Batman’s work.
Imagine being one of these stupid bitches that wants to put guys on blast and leak personal info, then get upset when it happens to you. No wonder men dont want to commit to women these days, brain dead retards.
Why every girl streamer has this simple jack hairstyle its hideous and i have seen alot of aussie girls with it what is it called and why its in fashion.
Ofc it’s the girls who never got asked to prom
she literally just admitted point blank that this was for "fun" and not "safety".
Correction:  anyone with THAT haircut doesn't want you to have fun...
I do want to know who the lowest rated dudes were so I can send them a pint for their service.
When will women learn that none of this will happen to them if they just stayed in the kitchen
These losers were trying to rate men as undateable, really? Isn’t that pot calling the kettle black?
So they can dish it but they can't take it!
correction: The data was not leaked it was pretty much published by Tea. Published as in uploaded into a public database that you could access by opening a link in your browser.
Where would one find this Tea Spill game?  Asking for a friend...
Thank you hacker(s). Now we know who are the karens to avoid and maybe sabotaging entertainment if they work for the card companies or entertainment biz.
Is that a woman?!
So this app is designed to warn women about which men NOT to date? Thankfully, the women who use this app are women we wouldn’t WANT to date.
Feminist be: "Absolute Freedom for me"; rules for them ... 4 chan : Wha? you said "equality"😂😂😂
The retard hairstyle with straight bangs is also an indicator.
if your a women and over 140 lbs you deserve to be cheated on
The thing is, these people have always existed in this amount. it's just that this truly uncovers how many exist.
The funny thing is, that app was entirely unnecessary anyways since criminal records are publicly available and searchable. They literally just made it so that the bitter mid women could slander and hate on men together.
Glad it got leaked
Anyone notice how all dem heaux at da end all looked alike?
The whole app was doxxing men, and they are mad that they are now doxed? That's fair though
All these chicks seem like the female versions of incels lmao
Oh also, perfect opportunity to create the same app, only inverted for male use only, and they could call it ‘beer’
I never heard of this app til asmon
Damn Glad I miss the Titanic boat
All the libtard fat woman, undesirables got exposed
It’s an app for unmarried women to complain about their dates, not only have we had equivalents to that for decades now, but their opinions haven’t mattered in all that time anyway.
Isn't this illegal? Shouldn't they be getting prosecuted?
The animals on my critter cam said they will pass on her…😂🫎🐻🦅. Come visit to see them!
Watching karma untold in real time
Find it very funny that the women slandering and mocking men in secret are now acting mad that the men are doing it back.
If it’s not name brand don’t download it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Helldivers theme was fantastic. A+ editing.
If you need an app to track the men you sleep with ….that says more about ur life choices…..and blaming others for it?…..classic female accountability avoidance maneuver.  Just OWN it, you are going through a phase, thought you’d just open up and see who walked in….now you regret it but can’t admit that 😂
Every time one of these "by women, for women" things fails I laugh.
Why have these women had bad experiences and poor luck with men? I can't imagine why.
He's a crazy idea how about hiring men for your app?  (Jk)
Another case of Schrödinger's Feminism.
So, an app that is dedicated to dedicated to exposing someone’s personal information to its users, is mad that another site exposed its person information to its users?  That makes sense.
I feel no compassion for all my fellow men who'd date those kind of monstrous-looking human females, though...
If these women are on that app, they are not dating, they are lying. Nobody would possibly date either of those. This was more than likely a witch hunt app.
How are all these hogs over 200 pounds this country is sick find a treadmill 🤢
The Troll Toll must be paid.
"Nothing feminine about feminism."
She got quagmire jaw
All we wanted was to play vidya games. 😤
Oh no!  What happened?  Oh no!  /sarcastic laughing
Someone is support managed democracy here. I meant that ost.
women shouldnt be allowed to have fun anywhere but the kitchen
Crazy how they all go to blind hairdressers and dosgy piercings😂😂 walking red Flares
What a disgustingly Misandric app.
Thank you 4Chan bros.
see just more reason to get the hell off the apps and social media. the grass isn't being touched enough and it shows.
"Vet men they had interacted with" yeeeah 99% of that interaction was said men either rejecting them or showing no interest in them, which as you know is of course a major red flag.
So a government issued ID determines gender?!?
LOVE the Helldiver/Super Earth anthem addition at the end of what the Tea App is.  God bless Democracy and Long Live Super Earth
looking at the male sewer slide rate since 2007 i ask do men really need this? do we really deserve this? throughout history only something like 30 percent of men procreated. I've given up on life at this point and it's because of things like this. there's just no point.
Apparently their "safety" is reliant on being allowed to destroy your reputation due to their own bitterness...  and for GOD'S SAKE FIX THAT HAIR!!! Why would AAAAANYONE think they look good like that!???
Where is the list?? Lol like Epstein list 2.0
I’m not saying the women in Tea are angels but reveling where all of them live is kinda fucked
Women having fun? Then this is just men having fun😂 wow they get on that app to basically dox and when it happens to them then it's unacceptable?? And not just men having fun?
Obviously no real men would date you anyway
I love it when these things happen  bringing everything out into the open  one of my favorite examples of this is when Ashley Madison got hacked  and everyone got to see the users of that website.
People tell me Karma is just for the superstitious but stuff like this just proves it is a thing.
They all look the same. Washed up unstoppered abandoned women. ❤🎉
All these women get off making false allegations and playing victim. We should make an APP that tracks females who make false allegations and just use the platform to feel “empowered” instead of working on their daddy issues.
Is this what you call a honey pot?
5’3” 190lbs? Holy shit.
what would happen if man do it ?
W for 4 chan
the code was obvs written by a woman
Any app asking you to scan your state issued photo ID is a big NO. So, now all the awful women looking to hate on men and be creeps are exposed. They neither accept nor acknowledge that THEY are the reason men refuse date them.
Dude took the tea and gave em the Boston harbor treatment
1:21 my guy, they are women. the concept of accountability is unknowable to them.
Lol the feminist bangs EVERYWHERE 😂
You reap what you sow...
And again the stereotypes prove themselves. What is the comparing app called? Would like to trym
Pro Tip: If an app or website wants your GOVERNMENT issued ID, don't use said app or site.
The fuck are these haircuts?
"Pity me, for I am no longer allowed to claim any and all men are murdering psychopaths without proof and convince women not to date them" -This asshole.
What’s with the bangs ?
What goes around comes around. Welcome to getting what you give. Learn a lesson about being a better person already, you hateful gremlins.
They're not ugly cause they're fat
"I don't like that all our info was leaked" -people who leak others' info
Oh boy it's the female version of island boyz
Forget those glasses. Did she use a banana to mark where to cut her bangs? WTF!
Good. The app already was doxxing men, so that the man-spiteful females being part of it getting doxxed is only right. Or should I say 'equal'?....
"somebody nasty" ... look in the selfie camera lady.
Guys, always remember to check the bangs, those small bangs that don't quite cover the forehead. If a girl has those, walk away; they are a man-hating feminist.
Women swimming in a sea of sharks online.
app's ID authentication requirement: users must have terrible hair styles
great example why trusting some app with your ID is a bad idea. they all have the same glasses.....
Where can we see the list of these 304s?
The ending 😂😂😂😂😂
App designed to leak private info Somebody leaks private info of the users  1:36 Calls said somebody "Somebody Nasty" for doing so...
this app HAD to be a 4chan honeypot, right?
that map looks fake, middle of the country should be almost completely empty with the edges packed.
Women are just men with no accountability
Wow, Helldivers theme song abused like this....thats soo non democratic, man.. :D
They all look like fucking toothbrush wtf is going on
I'm shocked I tell you, that a women with that hair cut and those glasses would say those things.
It's funny to watch people use "incel" about the same what white men used the word "n*gg*r" about 1925.
Should sue the creators of the app so they cant make anything like it again.
Is this karma?
They should do an app for guys, like they did and do the same thing they did, be funny to see them do a 360 and get mad about the same thing they did.
"No one can have fun on the internet." Hey, you picked this fight. You messed with the video games, so now you get to *be* the entertainment.
I was gonna say the chickens have come.home to roost, but all i saw were behemoth hogs.
Pay attention folks: this is about the the pron sites demanding "age authentication" by photo or government ID.
People are through playing with these wannabe victims.
LMFAO "Ugly Trolls R Us" would have been a better app name.
Wait a sec       Hold on up a minute Let me get this straight, these she beasts wanted a Questionable most likely illegal Data Collection Service, to out males, top5% really The Host, put it on an open forum, no hacking required, and now ALL these Women's Data is doing exactly that to them? Isn't that the Kettle calling the Pot Black?        So they are now Gas Lighting and Playing Victim.       Sounds about Standard OP.
My eyes! 🙈🙉🙊
1:02 It just keeps getting better and better and better every day😂😂😂
A US department of defense employee used her ID to get verified on a stupid app about ugly women? She sounds like a liability if you ask me
I just woke up that thumbnail scared me 😭
1:03 I recognize that melody
ROFL I guess woman can find Chads way easier now and not have competition from the thick-rimmed mids.
This is legitimately worse than anything ive seen men do as a collective against women. Women have problems with individual men but blame all of them. Men have problems with individual women and blame them specifically. We are not the same.
This is beyond parody. These ladies joined an app to share info, gossip and talk shit about men anonymously, only to wind up having their own info and photos getting shared.  Rarely do you see a more perfect case of "You reap what you sow" and "What goes around comes around".
These women are comically hideous 😂😂😂
Just a reminder that feminism isn't about equality. :^)
They used to have websites and social media groups like this for men but they all got banned. There is no way to protect us from crazies.
Yeah…but based off Asmon’s hideous appearance, I don’t know how he could talk badly about anybody else’s appearance.
The glasses and haircut screams, "I'm insufferable!"
Remember, these kind of people call you incels, homophobes, transphobes, nazis..etc.
we just won the war of the sexes boys
I love Karma.
The worse part about all of this is you just know guys ended up on that tea app for not treating them to a free 200 dollar meal. Or if the guy said one thing that would even remotely hint at him being center or right leaning they'd take to that app to flame him. So the reasons for men showing up on that app were minuscule.
She said somebody nasty leaked information. What about you girls?
Its an all you can eat slampig buffet!
The leaderboard bottom 50 is pretty rough on that game
the stuff wasn't even encrypted. it was just laying there, ready to be picked. FAFO
The 4chan "Intelligencia" sounds like a department of the Imperium of Man.
I threw up at those images
Why are they always unfuckable goblins?
The app should be illegal. The whole thing is just a doxxing nightmare. The government should go after all of them.
Do not let this situation sew further divide between men and women. We should stop being spitefull towards each other and focus on the REAL PROBLEM. The fact an app developer gave so little fuck about security they designed the app in a way that allowed all that personal data to be leaked and made public. Regargless on how bad the women are. No one deserves to have all their personal data spilled. These women could now be targeted by sex trafficers and abusive people. Imagine being part of the the sex slave trade and having access to all these women and their personal information? No one deserves to be sold into sex slavery and now all these users are at risk.   Again, say what you will about their looks, behaviors, attitudes, but WE CANNOT LET THIS DIVIDE US. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON HOLDING THE APP CREATOR ACCOUNTABLE. There needs to be proper systems and punishment put in place to keep users info safe. We are too used to giving away are information and trusting the systems that take them.
play silly games win silly prices.
Ah yes the best info. Age and weight of every woman on the app.
The doxxers got doxxed.  Each time something like this happens it gives me just a tiny bit of faith that the universe my be controlled by a benevolent god.
Mister editor please point out that the “coordinated group” was just one dude that happened to find that they left everything dumped in a publicly accessible form and it was literally just a matter of downloading it.
1:43 That's pretty transphobic. What about everyone that's not a lady?
Can't wait to see the internet historian video on this in 5 years
"oh no! the consequence sof ym own actons!! it must be their fault not mine!"
Female incels complaining about male incels.😂😂😂😂
I’m not surprised to see the vast majority of women using Tea are physically repulsive.
Thank you editor for the context. I had no idea what the app even was.
They're all fatties, that's soo funny.
wtf are these haircuts holyyyyy
That's a big cup of liber-tea!
Women with that hairline are perpetually offended.
girl you absolutely did it to dox men and push them further down the path of depression hoping they off themselves im 30000% convinced of that....youre a literal danger to anyone since you exist
Jokes on them I openly talk about how fucking deranged and psychotic they are
You’d expect for a woman to call guys incels to look exactly like these women.
The Asmongold - Nick Fuentes collab has to happen
"Gotcha bitch!"
Well dang, now that I know that it wasn't even a proper hack of private info, it's difficult to feel sympathy for these women. Make In-Person Communication Great Again
I wish Kevin Samuels was alive to comment on something like this. A lot a big Shirleys got their pics leaked
Sometimes I wanna throw my phone away and go live in the woods alone
Thank you 4chan for exposing all these Red Flag Women.
But why do they all look the way we expect them to look??😂😂😂
Men should create a comparable app for women called POUNDS!
"We want a safe space where we can attack, violate privacy and ruin it for everybody" - Karens. Its always the Karens. Sensible ladies out there need to be in the front of this to stop them because it affects them more than anyone.
It’s really weird how hard they go in on the DARVO and projection. Just reverse the genders in her opening statement.
Saw images of the guys they were judging and most were either average joes or fairly good looking dudes. Lots of gay dudes too. The ugliest were judging guys that were about 10 leagues out of their league and they couldn’t even identify which ones were batting for the same team😂 they just wanted a place where they could bad mouth men they could never get with.
imagine the app for men to trash on women, the drama would be a million times bigger. Double standard at its finest.
😂😂governmeny issued ID to join a women's whining app but not necessary for voting😂😂😂
Women who wear those glasses are doing a public service! They mean:  “Don't waste your time, I'm a semi-L, I don't think your myself, I hate men b/c I don't have a “member” and, I'm slightly dummer than wet concrete!”   Why dummer? Because subconsciously they know their built-in expression is exceedingly unpleasant and they are trying to hide behind the big lenses— they subconsciously believe they're “one-way”!
They look exactly how you'd think they'd look.
Glasses, it's the HAIRCUT!!! OMG who in their right mind pays someone to give them the bangs chop job we all did as children the first time we got our hands on scissors?! 😂🤣 what a tard!
The girl's glasses aren't the only signal. Every single woman I've met or seen online with a hairline like that is a feminazi. I count the no bangs thing in with nose rings, coolaid hair, and problem glasses as an outward warning of toxicity.
Foids are fuming, it’s hilarious.   Also, whatever weight they claim. Add 50-100lbs
Play stupid games Win stupid prizes....
This is art.
On a scale from 1-10, nobody ranked higher than a "2", at best.
Hogs mad
Oh my Lord, these women must be allergic to bangs. What are these hairstyles? Gadzooks.
Those glasses have fun radar so they can target it
Unsecured S3 bucket with listing API enabled.  I guarantee it.  Someone just logged in with a girls ID, looked at the network log where the pictures were stored, went to that link, and found.... everything.
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
Ah don't we all love it when Karma knocks on the door for these people? Not surprising that 4Chan is behind this though.
The helldivers music in the bg when choosing the cuter selection killed me XD. Also, why are they like midgets and 200 plus lbs with delusional standards lol.
Is 4chan back? Please tell me 4chan's back!
they all have the same fringe?
An app for defamation and libel was created by people who wanted to dox in secret.  Dont play with fire.
What kind of haircut was that?😂🤮
"security measures" bro it was a public bucket, all you had to do was go to the website lol
4chan, never ceases to amaze us.👏
You know who you don’t see in the leaked Tea app photos? Attractive women!
It's the bangs. They want to look ugly.
TWEEKER
These women look like hot topic freaks.
I have Liberal Fatigue.
Another win for 4chan, KEK
Ugly women shouldn't even need to be on that app they are safe ain't nobody tryna approach them 😂
That girl w the glasses has the craziest bangs!!!im so curious
If youre a mean-spirited, vindictive, judgmental person who ruins everything for everybody else, youre probably already so personally unhappy that you hate life to begin with.  You need Jesus, not Judgement.
Yeah, this new rage of BCG's (Birth Control Glasses) is a buzz kill.
They set up a service to dox men .... And get upset someone played the Uno Reverse on them 😂😂😂 All avoidable by simply NOT being an asshole. That's all the women behind this had to do.
All ugly personalities All goofy faces All 200+ lbs All mad at men
See, it wasn't even a hack. All of the data was stored on a publicly accessible database that could just be accessed from a url.
deal with the d3v1l type shi. You wanted a drama and dox app and the pitchfork man gave you one for 8 ez payments of 49.99
If the same app existed for men, there would be an uproar and people would want criminal charges laid.
Her dating issue is that hair style and glasses she looks like an 80 year old woman trapped in a 30 year old body.  Like Asmon said if there was a male only version of this app it would be banned in days if not hours.
The teapsill game link is spill dot info dot gf
They will end up dating ex con, anyway, by the looks of them.
We should make an app for men to report if we smashed or not, to keep track of body count, obviously weights, and shoe size, real cup size, ass....all that
First off I would fricking sue this app on the grounds of false information. Say a complete stranger makes up some crap about you, even though you have never met. Then when an employer types in your name, they find that fake story and judge you solely based on that.
I think she meant to say "Someone as nasty as us was able to leak our information".
think the most hilarious thing was this wasnt even some master hacker at work, some dude just figured out where the info was going, got into it rather easily, and just copied all the data and shared it online, no firewalls or anything
The app isn't allowed where I live, that says enough
Кто то проделал феноменальную работу.
where can I find that tea spill page?
how the fuck that app is even legal?
Weaponised autism wins again
0:09 not a woman, that forehead says it all.
Oh, these Tea App users don't like being treated the way they treated other people?  Yeah, I've got zero sympathy for any of them.
Yea none of these women should be picky
1:28 bitch looks like a steer
she 100% cut her own bangs and they dont look good at all
It's fascinating, isn't it? They downloaded an app, shared private information about their exes with other women, and then threw a hissy fit when their own faces and personal details were leaked to the public. The double standard is so blatant, it honestly hurts my brain that they don't see it  side note; It's hilarious how they *alll* look the same, just different weight classes.
We're always going defend ourselves..
the same people celebrated CoalFax getting taken down, it's only fair.
They look like cardboard
as funny as this is, when will the super hackers actually take down Mastercard and VISA? Quit being a bitch and take em down
Looks like a dude.
I like how these modern Western women made an app to stalk and harass men and it backfired in the best way possible
Where can i find the leaks?
Ashley Madison 2.0
5’ 6” and 180?! I’m 5’5”, and 130!
Women not allowed to ruin innocent men’s lives. Women most affected.  *I’m usually against the idea of robots replacing women but holy god, are they not making a case to be around.*
So wait does karma only exist for them when Mercury is not retrograde or something?   I can't understand their logic. So they wanted something bad to happen to others, and in doing so, something bad happened to them, but only now it's unfair!?
Luckily the usage of this app is illegal in the EU because the whole concept is a violation of the GDPR (sharing other peoples information without their consent) as well as allowing every man who got some negative rating to sue for defamation. But guess the point about defamation might also be possible in the US.
We should get these guys to try to just leak us the Epstein files next
There should be a public record lookup of "was this woman on the tea app?" - kinda like an offender's registry.
Why do identity documents in USA list a person's weight? Isn’t that weird? I mean, weight changes over time… No country in the European Union puts weight on an ID  😆  Ahhh, but now I get it — Americans always list whatever they’ve got the most of - FAT ;)
Why toxic women look always in a certain range equal?
I wonder if this was reversed and guys developed the war app which they could go on to and find out if the girl they are interested in is a psycho.
1. Ain't no man really trying to date 98% of you females on there. Trust. You probably put up soooo many filters and appealing angles to land those dates. Also some guys just want to hit. 2. How you gonna doxx all these men on your app, then get upset when you get doxxed? Typical women.
They got dox'ed by their own dox'ing site.  The howwa... the howwa.
fun fact: The highest elo on the teaspill website have men or people not showing thier faces (there are 2 women in the top 15)
The scary thing about it is how they store GPS location and who knows what other phone apps does this.
2:00 LMAO WTF
Liberal feminists will always win the hypocrisy game. You will never be able to make them even realize it.
All hail 4chan!
Are these women?  I can’t tell how did they variety it off of just a picture? 😂
Keep calling out toxic feminism
you can lie about your weight on the ID by the way. you literally just give them a number. So when you see the weight add about 20 to 250 pounds. The higher the weight they admit to, the more extra pounds you add to get a more accurate reading. If they say 100 pound, add about 30. If they admit to 200, add about 115. If they admit to 300, add about 175. DBB Math. What does DBB stand for? I'll let you guess.
I thought IDs were racist though!
No offense, but these ladies could have a better chance in Halloween.
They just got the UNO reverse card on them.
Women ☕️
Good riddance, whomever used tea doesn't even know how hard it is to find a decent partner on a dating app. Us guys have to dig through a bot apocalypse just to get a match, and god forbid that you live in a rural area.
How stupid to store information publicly. 😂 deliciousness at its finest!
Karma: 🎶 One way or another I'm going to get You 🎶
“Gender neutral haircut” 😂
They look like  those androgynous cult  members  from heaven's gate
Wtf are those humans O.o Character creation went ballistic  Demon souls levels of horror xD
"anonymous Advice" "Background checks" "reverse image search" "Phone Number lookups"  This is technically a closed doxxing / stalking platform. How the f*ck was this even allowed to exist and be downloadable on app stores in the first place? Like, don't the moderation teams of these app stores see this shit and go "waaait a minute.... this looks like a violation of some privacy laws here". An app that wants your ID in order to exclude another group of people and provides a platform to exchange the excluded peoples private info without their consent? This is so absolutely deranged and illegal, it's no wonder that the app is banned in the EU. Everybody involved, including active users, developers and the app stores that allowed this app to be published in the first place, should get sued into the depths of hell immeadiatly. This shuld be a wakeup call. Somethings is very wrong with this society if this goes without consequences.  Also: If the genders were swapped in this story, activists would very likely flood social media, the streets and congress. They'd scream for an uprising.
I love this. The feminist must be stopped.
Sup with all these bangs?
Karma is awesome, it always wins.
We dox you: heeheehee You dox me: boohoohoo  Thought these types of people were all about equality anyway 🤔
Imagine giving yourself the license to dox people to "feel secure", and the audacity to be outraged and furious when exposed. Next time go find a bear instead, seriously.
They just believed it was secure and full proof?? 😂😂  Fucking banks get hit with cyber attacks what makes them think this dumb start up app would be safe?
The dangerous internet hacker known as 4chan
I think its very telling that she thinks .. women "making false accusations against men" is a fun little game.
How this app was even legal
Funny thing is that, all this women are just giant walking red flags... They did themselves a favor by using this app, so that men can avoid the actual toxic women.
If these are the kinds of "women", and I use that term generously, using Tea, men should be so lucky that they want nothing to do with you.  Nothing says trainwreck like septum and facial piercings.
Projects like Bellarium Network are exactly what institutional money will chase post-regulatory clarity. AI + compliance-friendly DeFi? BEL has that early blueprint that made things like FET and RNDR explode.
The logic is very simple...  If a girl is very beautiful and hot, the guy who is pursuing her will transform into the Mr Nice guy that she always want without any red flags. He will treat her well and whatnot. So even if she got 'played out' in the end, she won't feel so mad because she thought she has met a Mr Nice Guy. He will become a total chameleon.   What about average and below-average looking women? Well, men will just show their true self with the f**k it attitude. These are the same women who always think they can do better and get the top 20% of males... So, without a doubt, they get all types of treatment and they will definitely use this Tea app to rant.  Just from the hacked database, it proves my point... All the average and below-average ladies. Ugh.
The Bangs are a dead give away she hates Men, and her Apartment smells like a Litter Box 10 days late of being emptied................
The Tea App revealed who the ordinary women are.  Men, remember, women are just women.  You want a lady, a true lady?   They expect us to act with chivalry. So, insist they act with grace and refinement.  Don't let ordinary women call themselves ladies. True ladies don't behave like them.
For my safety I want to know who the women are that think it's OK to post men to the internet and invite misogynistic attacks. I don't see why my safety is less important than theirs. This is a SAFETY app right?
all the women portrayed in this video are beasts and what is that last one even? an alien?
Why do they all look like people that would do that?
*The Internet is re-balancing its self much quicker than it use to!*
"No one can have a fun time" literally doxing and bullying men...
Granny glaases, “I cut my own hair” fringes, septum piercings…  The telltale signs are ALWAYS there.
They look like little kids that got ahold of a pair of scissors when their parents weren't looking and started cutting their own hair.
Why do they ALL somehow look like lord farquaad
Why they all look like red tur ds? ahahah
WHAT if the tea app was not a dev accident and really a political move to expose all the weirdos?????? Everything is so fake these days
these are the same women telling your wife to divorce you over your toxic traits like having a household budget.
The hackers united and the fugga wugga karens were exposed. 😬
They should rename the app to "Ugly Mutts".  I will let you figure out what it actually means.
"No one can have a fun time on the internet" didn't you make an app literally labelling men with red flags? if the genders were reversed it would've been a federal case
4chan for the win!
I have been lifting for over half of a decade and wish I could weigh as much as half of those women!
Grateful for the “leak”.
4 chan is like that C-Tier hero that's not that good and tends to mess up but when he locks in, it's glorious.
Cult members are easy to spot
Wtf is wrong with her hair line? Lol
RIP to the DoD bitch who got her info leaked. Say bye bye
Her haircut hurts my soul
Feminist glasses - damn those men for not wanting to let us women have fun on the internet The fun - doxxing men without any recourse or even firsthand knowledge of the doxxing and apparently with full consent of huge corporate entities like Apple and Google since these are official apps on the app store with the stated purpose of putting information of users that will not have access to the app
They gave all their data to a guy, and he posted it to a public website.  They've been distrusting the wrong men.
Bwahahaha! OMG! 😂 Viagra couldn’t get me hard enough to do any of these creatures!
You mentioned her glasses, but what's with her hair or is it a hair net causing those bangs.
See here's the deal, on Tea the information that was leaked was either publicly published info (Which I don't consider doxxing, don't post info you don't want anyone else using on the internet!!) or private info from chats. These guys not only got everyone's ID, but also sensitive ISP info like IP, geo location and MUCH much more because it was a cyber security leak that happened, not just the equivalent of that friend group who never got laid and just shit talk the opposite gender.  Very few want to admit that what 4chan did was incredibly wrong and the women here are rightfully the victims, even if what they were doing before wasn't morally correct....
Dude The world stinks!  like rotten fish
where the fuck is the website bruh
So they recreated hot or not.
This isn't a Leak, this is an full blown Oil Spill, Jesus Christ!
they just got there TEA bagged lol
One excuse I heard was "How will we know who the felons are?" Gee, I don't know. Public record sweetie?
Somebody NASTY got a hold of the information😂😂😂
Irony: Join site to stalk, dox , &  trash men then site gets hacked where you get doxxed, exposed & made fun of by the internet, but that's not fair!
There ain’t no way those w0men joined to tell a true story. Also is it “have a bit of fun on the internet” or “stay safe” sweetie?
I have no sympathy for the women who have decided to go on the Internet, make an account on sites/apps like Tea, and disclose the personal information of the men they've interacted with. These women are hypocrites for believing that their personal information should be protected while disclosing the personal information of the men they are criticizing.
Even funnier, it wasn't a hack. The database was public. It was just downloaded
I’m ngl to y’all. I’m a loser female. But I thank god I’m not this level of a loser female
Where can one find this leaked data?
I guess karens don't like to have a taste of their own medicine
Maybe they should reflect from within if they make bad choices on men. Like go for an opposite type of guy next time and not the 5% that uses and loses 75% of women.
This is exactly why Internet age verification/digital ID laws must be stopped
It shouldn't be called "tea,"  it should be called "REEEEEE!"
You are allowed to have fun on the internet. Weirdos like y’all try to take that away from regular people. FFs
You know, if a guy knows he was talked about on the tea app, would he have grounds to sue the tea app and the people responsible for doing it? Sounds like an easy win: defamation and breaking of privacy laws
I never would've thought those at 4chan are heroes. 😮
I don’t know what d u m b a s s designed tea and thought it was a good idea to make this app, but I’m glad it backfired in their faces and personally some of these women are really showing their true colors like the one in this video blaming in cells for her failing to face accountability.😅
Just wait until the blackmail starts
Lmao
The irony of complaining about there info being leaked while they were leaking info of men around the world.
I have fun all the time.
that haircut plus glasses is doing a just fine job keeping men at bay. keep it up so we stay away from your kind
Hoes mad, hogs mad. The lines are blurred.
That app isn't necessary... call the cops if a guy does something horrible. They just wanted to use it to humiliate and take advantage of men.
How could they possibly have thought uploading government identification to a gimmicky app's server and all kinds of personal information would be a good idea? Also, since practically only 20% of dudes have repeated success with dating apps, are they all harping on the same 20% of dudes?
dayymmmnnn lol
How did those women even get dates? LOL. We live in a clown world now.
damn hog city
The tea spill game lmao Top 50 are just either dudes, walls, ceilings, with <5 actual "okay" women. Bottom 50 is wild 😂
0:13 She and that look like that and calls men incels...
I love how incel no longer means anything except "someone online I don't like"
The “TeaSpill” app reminds me of the app Mark Zuckerberg made while at Harvard called “FaceMash” where it compared a bunch of the college girls and people had to choose which one was hotter 😂
The irony of the app being written by a woman and it not working right and being hacked.
american woman are handiccaped full stop
I just saw two transformers in this video bruh
I thought of creating something like this when my BF cheated on me... I was going to call it PUT 'EM ON BLAST! But it would be for the WORLD to see, not just women...
Sex: No
That haircut doesn't want you to do anything but nod and agree..
There’s no such thing as privacy when it comes to the web! 😂
I don’t think it’s the glasses that are the indicator, it’s anyone with that haircut in combination with those glasses that doesn’t want you to have fun.
My brother in arms is spreading managed democracy in the background. I'm so proud🫡🫡🫡🫡
Big glasses, tattoos, nose rings, face piercings, are all HUGE Red Flags. And the one gal with the Moe Bowl Haircut is hilarious.
"You reap what you sow."
Wasn't there a scandal where women created a spreadsheet of men not to date, and when that got exposed, some went to jail?
Women create an app to help them feel safe from incels and then are made even less safe by these same incels.
Lets start one for guys, track crazy chicks
Femcels are really trying to ruin everything
They built an app to expose mens info online and rushed to sign up for it as a good idea.  Then the womens info got leaked online and they are upset?  What is with women and insane double standards?
The best part was, it's my understanding that all this info about tea users was stored in a public domain by the site... So all 4chan had to do was find the url and go there and staff the m their findings around ... There was literally 0 security

1:16 FEELING SAFE DOESN’T YOUR SAFE AND FEELING UNSAFE DOESN’T MEAN YOUR UNSAFE.
Pointing this out here again but if there literally was an app that did the same purpose but for the other gender, these same Femcel specimens would (rightfully) call it out for being creepy, invasive and 'how it makes them feel unsafe'.
Feminism was the worst thing to ever happen for western countries.
Those subcreature femcels got a lot of nerve 😂
I bet if they did a data analysis the average weight would above 180ibs. HAHAHAHA
I had to salute the screen for the super earth anthem
sounds like karma to me. treat others how you would like to be treated. this is another reason why men have stopped playing the game.
says that it has been done just so they cannot have fun because of being a woman, meanwhile the whole app was literally designed as a profiling app to take away fun from men too
GOT EM
When my friends and I where in our twenties we tried to look our best, i.e., easy on the eyes. What are these women doing to themselves? Is it an ugly contest? Their minds and bodies are ugly.
They should have read the ToS. Tea specifically says nothing on their servers is secure. Now their crap is out there.  Check the Roasties map before you hook up with a girl. Especially if they look like a Reddit Mod.
Do they not know they’re a bunch of incels like tf 😂   Put it together ladies. Ladies is a stretch too, I should be calling you creatures 😂
These women:  "I'd rather date the bear." Bear:  "Get lost." 😂
So you got the lesbian 80s aunt, walking thumb "yanked back 0 effort hair", and the thrice caught trout with legacy lure and jigs facial DLC.
Cancel wave 2.0
A site/app dedicated to amplifying female gossip and doxing males. Borderline if not actually criminal IMO.
women think they can win this kind of thing 😂
Women make an app to list all bad men and avoid them, however, bad men are usually sexualy attractive to most women, especially if they're a chad, then they'll still date him  But then they add good men, but there's an issue, women are ruled by emotions, if a man that was good has standards and pisses a woman off then what's stopping her from spreading lies about him on the app out of spite?  Nothing and that's exactly what they were doing, be fair or be salty, an app made by mostly liberal women who are thinphobic lol
Pog the doxers got doxed. W 4 chan
The sus nature of posting someone's photos online without their consent aside, something tells me that the testimonials being shared on this app aren't the most unbiased and truth seeking. Case in point: Look at how she interpreted news of the leak.
Lmfao hoe playing stupid games
4chan inteligencia lol danger danger danger
Don’t Worry about the List Right now Guys! Where Gonna Get the List That’s a 100% Fact! Just Wait Till U Know Who Gets Pissed & Fed up with there lies! Only then is when we will get the Full List! RAW! Zero Data Corruption!
"..anyone with those glasses... and hair" I might add
4chan has done it again 😎
Its actually insane how a coordinated 4chan operation can happen these days, knowing how jannies are weirdly dedicated to pruning threads
Aaand, of course it's 4Chan...😂🍜
I can hear the helldivers 2 music miles away
And lo and behold, it's been revealed that the usual suspects that use the app. And they're mad that they got revealed.
The Ogre Kingdoms efforts were thwarted yet again...
Yet there were likely users on that app spreading false information about people who "wronged them" no doubt.
An app like this is like meth laced heroin for these trolls. Excited and happy to illegally dox others in their secret little community but cry victim when the turns are tabled and suddenly their own safety is in jeopardy rather than the guys they are doxing.
I think I saw my ex. God that was a bad chapter.
They all look like Gayle from Bobs Burgers 😂
yea this app suppose to be fun, and safe.... Some out these hoes lead hr departments, but their not smart at all,.... Your phone company gets hacked and leaks you're information, you're bank gets hacked an leaks you're information, you're hospital gets hacked and leaks you're information, you think you gossip app is not gonna either have men on there, or all you're data isn't gonna get hacked...... what are you stupid hoes doing, even with the top bitches on the site, Men will clap their cheeks but not date them.....the good guys these hoes crave are in their mother basement, but women being the breadwinners and supporting a family goes to far, so i guess we'll all be single.....
Those bangs tell you everything about her.
Women: “why are men no longer dating?” Also women: *has entire app to coordinate and sabotage men trying to date*
double red flags here, self cutting fringe & nose piercings.
They’re like “Damn we can’t defame men and dox them on the internet anymore.”
Why she steal mandark's long hair hairstyle
Imagine if this app was a whale trap from the very beginning that was made by 4chans
I'm waiting for the crowd of angry lesbians to boo me on the street.
Men, don't sweat.   The women that would be on this app would not be suitable for ANY man. They should just be lesbians, problem solved.
Not one of those, "women" look like they are interested in men.
Can the guys exposed file a lawsuit against the app or even the women that put them on blast?
UNO reverse card.
Gentlemen, that is a cosmic display of Karma, if I ever seen one.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So it's a sight to make up things to slander people they don't like. Gotcha
OK  Im gonna ask it.. What The FUK is up with those bangs and that FIVE head? I mean if your forehead is that big seriously pick a better haircut and glasses that dont draw attention to that exact area.
This has the same energy as a thief saying “how dare you steal what I rightfully stole”
Damn… I’m also 5’6” in the 180s and don’t look nearly that bad.
ill bet $100 this is funded by Soros or WEF
play stupid games...
Idk what that Hole is talking about. I'm having a great time
I know this case is outrageous but... somehow I think none of these ladies ever dated any of the men they listed. Or anyone.
1:05 helldivers?
I can hear a Super Earth Anthem in the background. o7
"You can't leak personal information, that's our job!"
This calls for a massive law suit. All the men on that app whose info was leaked should build a class action case to take everything from the creator, Apple and Google so that nobody else will dare do that in the future. In most countries private information is protected by law, and somehow Google / Apple failed in their duties to certify the app.
Note the I hate men fringe. Its sad the chicks keep discrediting themselves. Treating people as individuals was a nice dream. But the chicks are too prone to group think. Prohibition in US, egging Irish freedom fighters, the Nasi regeme and woke sexism. too many examples of chicks being the enforcers of a fucked up establishment. But big wig told us do it no excusse ladies.
i hope they eventually learn something from this.
Women with those bangs shouldn't be able allowed online
JUSTICE!
Women be failing so hard every single day😂 Its the overweight dingle looking ones who cant keep or get a mans😂
1:29  Hell lady, ANY man or woman that wanted to find you can just get his metal detector out and know exactly where you are to within 3 feet.
It's always the damn TORTAS!
It's amazing how easily they got outflanked even on the digital battlefield. Too easy.
1:30min you know tbh, we can all really be very gratefull, that they run around and look like that. It's easy to recognize to who you might keep distance.
WAIT THERE IS A GAME? OMG That is most hilarious thing ever... Literally Facebook 2.0
And this here proves why the internet should never have ID-based verifications, because this kind of stuff happens.  But yeah screw that app for trying to ruin the lives of men
BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHH that site is legit
Make an app, that's entire purpose is to cyber bully and stalker men. App users data get's leaked - WOMEN CAN'T HAVE FUN ANYMORE!!!! 😭😭 Level of delusion and lack of brain cells should be studied on this one.
No download link in sight (for the tea spill)
Youtube protects monsters like these women.
Women lost the plot of their lives. Due to main character energy.
Why do all these wannabe commies all look the same with their ugly arse bangs?...
A doxxing app lacked sufficient security measures?  No shit.  It's literally designed to collect and distribute personal information, and it's obviously run by the kind of shady scumbags that GOOD parents would warn their children about associating with.  That's like setting a firework off in your face and complaining that it lacked sufficient friendly fire protections.  Actually, based on how several of those app users look, there's a good chance some of them experienced that very phenomenon at one of their "mostly peaceful protests."
She’s 260 bro
S3re1al K1lL3r5 thinking rn "WHY TF DIDN"T I THINK OF THIS! Pics, profiles, GPS locations - on a freakin' silver platter!"
Hold on. They wanted to slander people, sharing their personal information with impunity and without the ability to disprove it, and call it "women just having fun on the Internet"?
That game that resulted from this looks like a fun thing to do with your bros when you get drunk or high
The only way this could be any better would be if the person/people who leaked it all came forward and they turned out to be normal women who are against double standards like this.  Imagine the reactions of the women on the app when they can no longer blame men for the leaking their private info from an app where they leak men's private info.
0:53 WHAT!
What if it was a woman that hacked Tea ...!  If she or her and male friends did release the geo locations of these females personal information , then society is healing
I'm shocked things like this are even allowed to launch. Do you guys not have anything like GDPR?? This is disgraceful.
Her hairline is ridiculous.
This is just a big roastie self own, Well done ladies you played yourself.
You know they're terrible people when you see those Oliver Tree and Skrillex mashup haircuts
Looks like the app did every guy on it a favor of not having to date those women.
FAFO ❤😊
Ha ha ha ha
Jesus, those glasses are so horrible...
Get the harpoons lads. There's some whaling to do!
This is pretty funny after watching the clip from earlier about women being disappointed that they aren’t approached by men, and while there’s probably not much overlap between them and the Tea ladies, can’t help but wonder if one group ruined things for the other but will never acknowledge it.  Anyway, I do not envy straight men trying to date in the current cultural environment.
1:46 online zoo exhibit is crazy
Pure karma, absolutely amazing.   They aren't just on an app to give out personal info, they are using an app to degrade the reputation of people; that's high school shit. What you didn't grow up just yet?  Now that they are experiencing both things, it's wrong? These kids were likely all making the red flags shit up. If that's what you called having a little fun, well welcome to the internet. Gotta be ready to get burned if you intend on playing with fire kids. Like what kind of dream are they on?
Jesus christ those bangs are terrible
I’m sick of seeing and hearing these people. Deport them.
I have no problem with women warning women about potentially abusive partners and such. So, I am not inherently against an app like the tea app... If regulated right.  Buuuut, while I don't know the full story, I assume it was abused as a means to warn women about "low value" men instead? And that likely led to the hackers motivation and everyone's doxing.  Do I have the right of it?  On a side note: there are no low value men nor low value women. There are only personalities or mentalities that are toxic and should be avoided at all times.  That is my perspective.  Furthermore, should we not slow down on dating people? Why is "everyone" in a rush to get hitched or into each other's pants?  I believe real love cannot be forced or rushed.  I believe that it takes bonding slowly first, gradually working your way  through life together, and you would naturally, eventually have the same end result, but far healthier.  This goes for both men and women.
Joining an app that do nothing but doxx and bully men. Then play victim when it backfires and you get doxxed and bullied yourself.  Can´t make this shit up. 🤦‍♂  This is just insane, the level of entitlement, narcissism and delusion required to not see the hypocrisy here are just, wow, it´s so stupid i can´t even put it out in words.
bozo..............the tea bag lawsuit app..........
I always hate when women say "its because we're women" no the fuck it isnt. 90% of times when women get into shit like this, it has NOTHING to do with their gender.   It easily has something to do with, hm, i dont know, let me think...doxxing men? For the sake of gossip and harassment? If anything the only gender being attacked here are guys.   Wonder when 4chan and its users are gonna make a tea time for guys...
Its men's fault for the leak to happen ofc :DDD
These people would have been very successful in the 1840s to 1940s.
Reminds me of the scene from Constantine   YOU DARE, IN MY HOUSE?!
Let me just say - thank you for your service incels.  God bless.
Just like Tea app for men, the Tea Spill game was taken offline in minutes.
Incels vs Femcels
Everyone knows where your nose rings are.
4chan finally goes back to doing public services
the world is healing, those genetic dead ends wont pollute the gene pool anymore
"Thats me" kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
even the facebook groups are more secure than that app lol.  they won't stop
Somebody nasty leaked info? Look at what you're doing. Don't think what you are doing is nasty?
More prof that woman are the problem.
I refuse to believe those jabba the hutt looking hambeasts were getting dates, so were they just making stuff up about random guys?
you think this is bad, keep in mind every single Brit bong now has his ID logged in a government server to access google. corporations get in trouble for storin biometric data of children, just imagine the fallout once the Brit servers get hacked, AND THEY WILL Arab rapist are gonna have a field day
Forget the glasses anybody that has a hair cut like that should not be trusted.
Let's be honest about this, both of the women he showed should consider themselves lucky that any guy would want to date them...which is probably why they're so toxic when it comes to men.
"Fun time on the internet for women" is stalking and harassing men. Those poor ladies.
Congratulations, girls. You've now officially entered the "FO" phase of the process.
So doxing people on the app is ok?
Toxic Femininity at its foulest.
all those "ladies" look like fcking frog people oh my god
Reminds me of how girls act when dudes find out they’re cheating. They cheat and end up crying and playing victim and somehow you’re the bad one. ZERO accountability
Tell her to get back to work at Starbucks
4Chan doing the Lord’s Work with this.  These totalitarian minded slugs are a big part of what’s wrong with the world.
Man, those are some ugly fking creatures.
Isn’t this a version of “revenge porn”?
Them are some ugly as hell troll dolls
with that hair cut and those glasses, RED FLAG!
This app is fuckin creepy
Consent for me, not for thee.
It doesn't store anything, metadata of pictures taken with cellphones register the geolocation it was taken.
4chan justifying existence. Man oh man. I crap on that site because I was using it back in the someyhingawful days, but it has legit done some impressive work. Anon, you slick bastards
Once again, thank you, 4chan.
It's insane these women don't realize they are literally female incels themselves
Behold, gentleman: The League of Unextraordinary Catwomen
It's facebook all over again XD
An app of old fat white women meant for doxxing and spreading their hate towards men gets doxxed. Peak.
That's like the fantasy of all women, expose men they dont like to the world as the phones they are
Those photos be like, things that make you go burrhhhh
They entered a PVP zone and used taunt.
0:16 sh i have one sorry asmono
Fat and/or ugly women are big mad….   Anyways, how about that Sydney Sweeney?
I guess a "fun time" to these women means gossiping about, doxxing, and defaming men.
I just love the smell of karma in the morning.
your not keeping anyone safe... your grooming and docxing
Super 4chan protects.
Those weights at the end were obviously fabricated. That lady's head look more than 190 pounds on it's own.
This proves that these people are exactly who you think they are.
Has someone made one for guys that details which women are loose and easy? Which ones to hit up for a quickie, no matter which city you are in? Million-dollar idea.
karma strikes back
The terms "women" and "taking accountability" go together about as well as peanut butter and gasoline.
THAT'S A WOMAN???
0:58 Salute the flag, Helldivers!
Why would a man or men care to hack an app like that? Maybe what those women think about men is true.
I thought for sec she was wearing a starbucks apron and im like "that's fitting" 😂
Amazing what they call fun 😂wtf. They're sick individuals
These Femnazis are out of control.
So let me get this straight. The women are allowed to post our personal information for all to see but hackers can’t post their personal information for all to see.
When you think stupidity has reach the limit!!! how much lack of common sense you have when you think your data is secure in a place that exclude part of population?!?
Oh, now they care if people are safe. Now, it's an issue when it's flipped back on you. Now it's freaking tragedy. What a bunch of hypocrites.
Make em think twice before they join an app like that 😂😂
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!
5 foot 3 and 200 pounds is DIABOLICAL
At this point this app was a honeypot
Imagine if that was the purpose of the app all along?
i didn't know 4chan was back!! Fuck yea!
These people
Potato head in those leaks!!!
Those stupid little bangs are the reddest flag
They just not publishing things about other men without their permission but they also making tea lovers their enemy....  Use ur coffee latte name, u stupidos....
"You cant have fun on the internet if you're a woman." And if the shoe was on the other foot, they would cry sexism. Women are the worst.
A female incel saying the incels are at again, she's for sure one of those horse girls that would make noises in class
Remember to take your meds, kids
I hated 4chan until this video.
"Wow, these incels won't let us have fun by ruining portions of men's lives by targeting their relationship prospects based on literally any reason I decide."  Way to make incels sound like the good guys, ladies.   Women genuinely don't understand that the rest of us don't need consent to this idea that bad sh*t they do is justified.  The answer is simply no.
I rather take my chances on the Titanic wearing fifty-pound weights strapped to each leg, then ever get on a dating app. Yikes!!!
It’s literally a bunch of lesbians, talking bad about men so they can convince more women to become a lesbian. That CLEAR as day based on these videos
The first woman got that im offended by everything haircut
They want ID for a website but not for election voting.
The cows were hearded
They are uglier than a mud fence.
Defamation and doxxing is not "fun" lady. It's a crime.
To summarize the rankings (minus the pictures of dudes and random objects): Skinny white women under 30 are the highest ranked, large black women over 30 are the lowest ranked. Beauty standards DEFINITELY aren't real.
Wow, I had no idea what the app was for. I'd read about this terrible app that exposed the privacy of its users. Article left out what those users were doing.
unhinged single women being unhinged
I heard the super Earth theme when the game was on screen!
you touch the internet you have a debit/credit card you have a id its all been leaked/tracked/catalog at some point people who think its secured are stupid either you live in the middle of bum fuck no where with no internet or your info is all there
Fun time with those bangs.
just shows you how you ppl are special needs
Rest assured that while the modern world has made it possible for women to try and pull stunts like this, most women remain sane and level-headed. Go to Church, use your brain, and stop using dating apps. The woman you're looking for is out there, bros, and she's never even heard of Tea. If she has, she either vomited or assaulted the "friend" who told her about it.
Females ran men out of society so now we run them out of the internet
sounds like everyone on that app hated men and was as she said "nasty". I dont know how these women dont realize they are the female equivalent of an incel.
can we have one for men and call it "Street Sweepers"
1:15  So smug, overflowing with gnostic resentment.
Stereotypes exist for a reason. If she looks like b*tch then she is a b*tch lol.
They almost look like they’re all siblings lol.
4chan doing the lords work.
I don't know how I started watching you but I'm glad I did.
Some shit like this got my cousin prison time… idk how tf a female got him into that situation. They stay trying to Kahoot.
C'mon Mr. editor, you were too kind, i've seen lovecraft monster tier photos of the users of that app. Lmao.
Adult highschool is all this has been reduced to. Sheeple livin for the front cam. D mb C nts
Once again mob justice is the only functional justice.
Leakers got leaked, ain't karma a b?
god, we need Internet Historian to do a piece of this like how he did 4chan vs Tumblr wars 👉📨
Oh no not a liberal barista feminist getting angry 😱
I bet my ex is on there & sure of it. Im tryna see the map but I cant find the link
At least women these days cover themselves with Dead Giveaways so you know to avoid them from hundreds of feet, even miles away.  The bangs The glasses The piercings The tats The dyed hair The body shape The body hair  All before they even open their obnoxipus face holes, bless their hearts.
4chan Anons, thank you for your service.  Praise Kek!
I don’t see anyone wanting to be with that chick in the beginning and I bet she claims to have been sexually assaulted multiple times even though nobody even wants to be near her
When the femcels are trying so hard to call everyone else incels. How is it that female incels are collectively so much worse? This is really disgusting behavior. Did they just assume men do this to women? Nah I don't feel bad for anyone that uses this app. GTFO of here ladies.
notice all those women are the ugly and average ones that chad hit and ghosted because they are just easy
1:28.  Come on LOL
Bro, it's literally a platform that leak man personal information.  This is just fcking karma
I think all of this is AI.  I don't think any of this info is real.
Can I ask.  So are White Guys still going to talk about the White Replacement Theory when 99% of White Woman are nasty and most to all White Guys become Passport Bros and F up the White race themselves?
That girl cuts her own hair... nuff said 🤷‍♂
Literally the ugliest of women from the various corners of the US.
Wow, this elo rating is brutal! Scientific method to prove how much they're not 10/10!
Bahahaha
You want the bear, you got the bear.
I bet 90% of chicks didn't even seen this guys, no f way the guys went on date with this whales.
An app about doxing men got a bunch of women doxed. Oh how the tables turn.
Absolute physical state of these creatures.
So it's ok to Dox men, but as soon as you get doxed then "fucking patriarchy". Got'cha.
FAFO ladies. Well done, 4chan
The internet is no longer "free" it's been literally shrinking and becoming draconian for over a decade due to corporations, politicians, paywall providers.. Wanna know who's been one of the biggest voices in causing that? Women's advocacy groups & activists.. Huh geez I mean you helped make the internet squeaky clean and all politically correct and fully feminist doctrine.. Still not enough is it. Oh right we know what's next, you have to have an ID associated with your online activities and let's throw in a social credit score as well, will that make the internet safe for women this time.. Oh it's already rolled out in the UK let's see what happens next.. Meanwhile seeing as the internet is catered to women's needs and they can have a legal website that can be used to damage, attack and permanently disrupt a man's life.. Oops spaghetti, some people got upset and did something, let's bring back the website but make it government for all the western countries huh? Wanna bet that happens folks..
honestly i do like the general idea of the app, warning women of married men trying to date or men that have harassed women in their area, however doxxing them like giving out their full address, phone number, etc. isn't the right way to do it
the inteligencia that is 4chan
HAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
Of course it's the most bitter, most undateable fucking excuses for women that nobody wants to smash, the most feminist btw, who'll create something like the Tea-app 🤣🤣🤣
4chan once again, coming in clutch.
Sometimes karma hits you fast.
1:35 yeah, that'd be rough if "somebody nasty" could get your info
5ft 3 - 200 lbs - you are the size of a dugongs calf at that point - stay clear brothers.
The sweet and swift retribution of karma hitting these angry trolls hard. Imagine being so incompetent that you create a doxxing website, to only have it be turned against you. Poetic Justice brought to you by 4chan. 😂
Another W for 4chan 😂
moc. su depmurt eh. < Backwards
Why do they both have a variation of lloyd's haicut from dumb and dumber?
Karen glasses and cow noses
Deport them
First clip literally looks more like a actual incel than a woman
gossip is to women as 🌽 is to men
I gotta say this: as a, possibly decade-loyal member of Asmongolds, female viewerbase. I have quite a lot of fun on the internet. Maybe she hang out with the wrong people??
4chan intelligence lol, that’s the best thing I’ve heard.
“Can’t have fun on the internet”…that should tell you something. It’s apparently just j casual fun to have a nationwide group of people secretly talking shit about people they have dated.  That’s supposed to be fun.
Why do these woman choose the worst haircut possible?
So expose men that they didn't click with basically.
The app isn't a safe space for men, but she doesn't care.
She should be deported just for that haircut alone.  Edit: 1:28 WHOA WHOA WHOA BACK OFF MUTANT
That haircut should be a crime itself. This is what happens when you dont get bullied enough in school.
So the app was in favor of discrimination and segregation?   The uno reverse card is amusing.  Oh perhaps this is a precursor to phone location and implications of actions of another certain location in the news...
Did someone..........................................................................................................................................................spill. the. tea
Why aren't women who complain they can't get a man called "incels" as well?
Super left leaning person here. Last night I was literally like "this tea app is bad, and to know it's bad all you have to do is know that if men made a "men's only app where they could vet women before dating them" it would be heinous to everyone. Looks like...omg I was right.
This is the first time I've ever been happy about an app getting hacked
the hoes got busted...
fuck around and find out 🤣🤣🤣
That they're still playing the victims so..... Typical
Frumpy bitches in birth control glasses, angry at being outed as awful people.
That's my species btw 🫩
When are girls gonna learn that anything connected to the internet is not secured; giving up your license is a stupid idea if youre not making money (for tax purposes)
Western women are legitimately total trash
260 LBs is just disgusting
Half these women aren't even hetero; they are just there to bash men. Perverted delusional cow harpies Getting what they deserve
0:19-1:05 Our way of life, galaxy-wide Paved with the skulls of those who've died Unslakable tide of Super Earth pride A torrent that can't be satisfied We sacrifice for paradise Anything less will not suffice Citizens rise, liberty rise Super Earth, rise up to the skies
Internet is healing ❤️‍🩹
Her idea of fun is doxxing people and ruining the reputations of others.  She's a miserable sow who wants other people to be miserable too.
Women all complaining about undateable men. It's all young ultra left leaning wokies and overweight menopause flabcreatures.
No surprise most of them are uggos
i bet a guy ran the tea app and left the door open on purpose
These people,  trusted an app.  WHY?   Tomorrow Musk can Leak your ID for your check mark...    WHy do you trust these people.?
More like a reversal of the reverse ploy to destroy men.
Docs the docsers from the docsing app? "I HATE YOU FOR DOCSING ME FOR BEING A DOCSER!!!" This is why people hate feminism. "It's ok when we do it because we are women." Everyone else "No".
Best part is, those pictures have no filters.
Plot twist: This was teas plan all along. Because it was coded by dudes.
They do look like what they sound like
women trying to do security, hilarious
Bitter nasty woman with no hobbies
The one with the dumbest haircut calling people incels and blaming everyone else needs a reality check
My doxing app doxed me,,, waaaaaaaa!!!!!
Is that Andy Dick?
Oh no... the app they used to ridicule and doxx men who didn't respond well to women most likely catfishing them got leaked and they have been doxxed themselves?  Because let's be honest, I bet if we asked the guys who were targeted why they broke up with those women, it's VERY likely because the woman herself was demanding, acting entitled and most probably faked her profile picture on whatever dating app they matched on because those women wouldn't even get a second look at otherwise.  Fuck around and find out; gotta stop having apps that enable people to simply excuse their lack of self-accountability by putting the blame on everybody else.
Creating an app tracking men you don't like while at the same time preventing male access only to then fully track the exact location of the females using them and feed on their data. That's some crazy playing both sides machevellian double agent shit... Then they complain that their data was leaked as further fuel to hate men...🙃  And then they say it's the men who are unreasonable. Sure...
1:27 "what the hell is even that???"
0:11 are you sure it's the glasses and not those hideous bangs?
Salute to those gents that spilled the tea 🤝🤝🤝🤝
Top winner is a video game console
Toxic masculinity is beginner levels Female toxicity is that professional league, with playoffs and tournaments.
lol all these woman are at least 50 pounds heavier than i am and i consider myself chubby my god
Thanks again 4Chan, the last defense of humanity 😂😂
Hey Asmond, have you seen gamesaru yet????
I wonder how many of these undatable women use Snapchat filters to catfish men?  When the men show up and see they look nothing like their profile, they ghost the woman.  The woman then goes to the Tea app and doxx and libel the man for being horrible without his knowledge or consent.
I'm feeling more like this was some sort of psyop on ugly women.
1:46 Those weights are in stones not pounds
Borderline bangs.
What is with their bangs. Gross
Somehow this got even better.
She has one of the shittiest hair cuts I've seen
Imagine not letting a specific demographic of people into your store in real life, and how much legal trouble you’d be in.
Just because some women are ugly doesn’t mean that what there were saying about those people  weren’t true , like that’s immature logic  . It proves them right that incels doxx them
When you show the photos of the Tea app users, you should have the gross up scream play in the background. If you’ve seen the Marvelous misadventures of Flapjack, you’ll know what I’m talking about
Rather ironic that they found out karma is a bitch too.
They act unpleasant, they look unpleasant and they are shocked when men don't want to date them.
I'm actually convinced Tea was set up by men for exactly this purpose. A 4chan false flag if I've ever seen one. And it worked.
Thief be like: I'm finally get once in a life time choice 😂😂😂
"hack" 4chan did the equivalent of an autistic google search and found the data sitting in the open with 0 security  Also LMAO the teaspill site is 502ing because of how much traffic this brought
I wish I could comment, but everything I would have said was said much better by so many other commenters.  All hail our 4chan overlords!  The idea of "fun" for undatable women is doxxing innocent men?  I agree that there are no innocent parties in the leak.  They all knew the app was for doxxing and libeling innocent men for whatever reason.  Did their reviews of the men they have libeled been made public as well?  I think this would be a good thing for trial lawyers with the uptick in defamation lawsuits.  I don't think they can use an anti-SLAPP defense because they libel private individuals, not corporations.  I think it would be so cool if these doxxers get sued by every man they defamed.
4chan is an image board with more plants and shills than actual users. And among those actual users only a tiny fraction would carry something like this out. I'm worried this might be a play to "shut it down" ff if you will. Basically they're nypa and if an individual chooses to do something while sitting in a thread on a Peruvian basket weaving forum it's not the Peruvian basket weaving forum that should be blamed.
oh no.  your insane lunatic site was shown to be nothing but male hatred.  cry harder
anyone else raising an eyebrow while remembering the wisper app that showed you how close the OP was?
So theses women will never gets dates again.
Im sorry but what was that at 0:33
I can confirm that she was on the tea app based on the fact that she looks like that
"If you don't support us bullying and doxxing people you are an incel"  Can we just laugh at anyone using that term already? It's literally always used by idiots like this now.
All ugly women
HLLDIVERS 2 HYMN????? FOR SUPER-EARTH ✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊ 1:03
Whoever created this app, is just the kind of person who would make all the wrong moves and decisions in horror movies; remember the quote.. "You can't fix stoopid"
What A damn stupid idea
And they look exactly like you'd think they would
4chan for the win
THEY ARE ALL F*CKING HIDEOUS TROLLS
They keep using the face framing haircut, wrongfully assuming anyone wants to see that shit
The "hacking" equivalent of taking something left on the middle of the sidewalk
We’re dumpy bangs a requirement?
Fun time on the internet? What a horrible person.
Funny they let this list out about the citizens... But hide the list of the elite pedofiles
Present day, present time. Hahahahahahahahha
Of course it’s the 666 crowd:  “They gotta be 6 foot, make 6 figures, and be 6 inches long or they ain’t a man!” But they’re built like that old slug lady from Monster’s Inc.
As usual "they look exactly how you'd expect".
When people say there’s plenty of fish (women) in the sea, I never listen to them. Half the fish are spoiled, the other half are too fishy, and there’s maybe only 1% that’s worth catching.
This is why women hate other women. They do stuff like this and intentionally make it harder for other women! They  get miserable and then ruin it for other women further.
They are lucky its not the 90s and 90s hacking groups. Oh boy they would be really unhappy.
Again they were dumb enough to create an app that required geo location and government ids to bash on men. Of course it was going to get leaked because you created a list of all the femanist karens
So far i have only seen 2 attractive women
Goes to top 50. A guy, photo of a coke can and a laptop. So much for verifying who is using the app.
They all look like we all thought they would.
i don’t particularly enjoy making fun of people for their physical characteristics, myself not being the most handsome or fit individual on the planet but holy crap that last lady is definitely what a fish looks like who suddenly woke up as a human 🐠
Calling this a hack is like calling someone that took the garbage you left outside a thief. Put the blame on the developers that left public access to the images, not the people that downloaded the PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FILES.
Sex: No thanks.
Imagine if men had done something like this.  Where are the arrests? Oh, right, when it's women, they get a pass
"we cant have fun on the internet as woman" then turn it off😂
The creator of the Tea app is a man, man.   Is this one of the greatest honey pot trolls in the history of the interwebs? I like to think so.
Another modern male W
They REALLY thought they would be able to escape 4chan
Someone wrote an insecure app? If you want a job done right, get a man to do it.
How mentally unstable do you have to be to get a piercing so high up on your nose that it’s almost on your forehead
It was on a public website without encryption.  It's not a hack, leaked to public I guess is accurate even though it's always been available to public technically
If she can't have fun because she is a women, has she tried this neat simple trick that apparently works nowadays of saying "I am a man" and magically reality bends to your will and everyone has to say it is fact? Then she won't have to worry about not being able to have fun anymore.
So it's a stalker app
The Helldivers OST in the back is absolute cinema
The problem with apps like this is most men, even the ones that treat woman well will get a low rating over a break up or not wanting to talk to a woman anymore and then she's angry and goes off on you on the app
Liberal Karens will never win.
😂
This had to be another 4chan psyop, and they took the bait hook, line, and sinker. Bet one of the devs just decided to leave a backdoor for the lulz, and is currently laughing his ass off until the next decade.
Watch how they will get mad about the game 😂
Watch how they will get mad about the game 😂
So was it a bunch of overweight unattractive people sabotaging men because they can’t get them?
It should be illegal to be a Karen
I bet you they're the first one's against "boys will be boys"
The "T" in women stands for "taking on the burden of your accountability and consequences of your own actions"
I you love 4Chan. Genius. Quite simply genius.
Shouldn’t people be able to sue for defamation, slander, and liable?
They all have the same haircut, glasses, and piercings
Wait you have WEIGHT and HEIGHT on your IDs???
100 percent *BULLET PROOF SECURITY* ... and this goes back to the days of DIAL UP  >>>>> ITS NEVER BEEN DEFEATED  *never put actual information O N L I N E*  ......  ooooops
All the women on that app are ugly whales 😂😂
Regular normal women are having problems in the current environment that they have created, these women might as well just move to a deserted island now. They think they got problems now.
You know what I will learn how to hack just to hack tea
100 women v Accountability
200 lbs at 5'3''  with a 75lb head . They should turn to Islam as they demand face coverings , is that why they are so angry ?
So the ugly women are keeping other women from men. Way to prove the stereotype.
Gotta love 4chan
Government: go ahead karen get our attention we know where u live (not that we already didnt) but cmon do something crazy were just waiting to come atchu
Someone spilt the tea 😂
Doxxing revenge site gets doxxed and feeling justice... Women and accountability... Oil and water...
I saw some of the leaks. They were posting private medical info of people they were gossiping about. Hope that company ceases to exist
Do these goofy ass people look in the mirror. That girl has the most hideous hair cut I've ever seen.
Crap like this is what makes me want to turn off all my electronics and disappear in the mountains for a week. These apps, these people, they are so awful that they distort and ruin my view on the whole world.
The projection goes so hard, I can see it in 4K on my wall.
INSTANT KARMA
Oh my god I didn’t even realize they got everyone’s weight too 💀
The karma is pure gold why do they all have rings on there faces
for sure she cuts her own hair lmao
what is up with those bangs?
I hate women like this. Makes us look so bad. Seriously, these are the rights our ancestors fought for? The b*tches looked at the legacy of all the women that got us the right to live our lives how we want to and not be dictated by men, and they're turning it into the worst mistake they ever made! If we lose our rights, im blaming these wh*res. Also, did everybody forget that we ultimately got equal rights in the first place because a bunch of WHITE MEN said we could?
Man how the tables turn , ya love to see it
Using your DoD CAC as a dating ID is insane. She neeeds to lose her job immediately for poor OPSEC
That hair line is hardcore
Looking at those women - how are they dating to even judge men?
bro has the helldivers music on in the back
Whats in that TEA!!!! Who spiked it i dont feel so good :/
Why do they all have that same stupid haircut?  It's not edgy, it's fugly
CHAN-MAN COMETH 1:29
It sucks when you get treated the way you treat others
Only women would ever do this. So vindictive and petty
So, basically it was a femcel app.
It's a Karen App that turned on it's users. I never thought I'd end up saying Karen App
ironic, isn't it
this 100% was a honeypot
Karma remains undefeated.
The user IDs were not even a hacked the information was on a public website they just thought no one would look
I'm confused...why is that girl not more concerned with that awful hairstyle? Does she not understand how bad that looks?
I downloaded the full 244gb  woof the women are woof
All these ugly chicks want the 10/10 guy btw. You don't measure up to their "standards".
Imagine going to an app to get personal info on ppl and your personal info is compromised 😂 women ☕️
this has to be defamation. all of them should be charged with something, how did that app even get passed into the appstore
An app designed by women is full of ethical problems and holes? Well, color me surprised!
wouldnt this app be illegal in CA, due to strict privacy laws
I wonder if trans dudes were allowed to join
Those weights were such cap 🤣
Why won't men step up to date women anymore... exhibit A. Also, she has that backwards, she's the type of person that doesn't want anyone having fun on the internet, or otherwise.
"No one is allowed to have fun on the internet, especially if you're a woman"  Yeah, says the people who are actively censoring everything.
You created a social that demonize men that approach woman. You destroyed an entire generation of men to porn than approaching women. If these women want a reaction of men, go to Indian see what happens.
The worst thing the internet has done is give these mentally ill people the ability to communicate with each other.
Bro this is way too much fun 😂.
Ok as a UK woman can we stop bulking these American women in with women everywhere? That’s your guys mess to clear up 😂😂😂
That's rich, a bunch of femcels calling the dudes that hacked the app "incels". They're so bitter that nobody wants to screw them that they've gone insane.
ok but I kinda want to see the men and what was said because either our boys are down bad or they're just as bad
Why can't 4chan do this but with Collective Shout and the payment processors?
For the life of me, I do not understand those nose rings.
😆😂🤣😭😅 karma’s a bitch
She calls the ones who exposed them nasty... That's an interesting take.
Is it really hacking if your app has the same level of security as a pr0n website that just asks if you're over 18?
Ha ha ha ha she’s like a little Chihuahua all bark no bite
Any woman with Lloyd Christmas bangs is a warning sign.
lol those girls look like demons
4cuck did something huge
Women are legitimately fucking stupid. There's no other way to explain behavior like this. They're just terrible fucking people
Rejected women: Here's all the personal informations of men i've interacted with. Also Rejected women: Why are there no men who wants me?
I swear, nose rings are proof positive your opinion is invalidated.
The craziest part is these people are the most toxic people I can think of and yet they’ll still call the rest of us toxic just because of a small stupid reason
funny how karma works, huh
Maybe women should just try not being so horrible to men.
they're always Victims
Ita kinda crazy because  if men that that app.. they would loose there minds
Buncha troll women mad that men don’t like their androgynous self hating vibes
Send all of those women "hogs" to Ukraine
4chan did Gods work (capital ‘G’)
Maybe the whole app was a psyop by 4chan to catalog the psycho
so tea app got tea app'd ahahahha you losers femcel ahahahahha
AHHHHHHHHHHH the consequences of my actions!!! NNNNOOOOOOOOO
4chan weaponized autism division strikes again
Two groups of people....
I like how this feminist cannot fathom that most likely, a percentage of the "hackers/leakers" are female. This is just right vs. wrong not men vs. women
Does anyone believe that these women ever went on a date?
She was posted on the tea app leak she proves it by how upset they are lmdao 😅all of em
This guy is a retard
Most of these women are clearly lying about their weight on this app too. Definitely heavier
Dangerous times we live, folks feel too comfortable being disrespectful.
I'm just happy they aren't all on one side of the country. We could have tipped over.
Of course our saving grace is 4chan. Also it is a fun game the TEASPILL
You see how the ones complaining all look the same. You know they are those karens making everyone's life miserable. In the name of protecting women.
I'm fucking blaming App Stores and Play Store for even allowing this type of app to exist, when the whole premise of the app is built to expose specific people without due process. No Moderation or Safeguards, For them to approve an app like that shows their review process is either incompetent or they just don't care as long as it's not blatant malware.
Always the last resort children batter buckets, the 1, 4 when drunk...who think they're 10s
you know what, all those crystal girl were right.   we are entering the age of Aquarius  where the truth will be let out. women and politicians FAFO
Why am I not surprised?
The wild thing is that identifying information was stored after verification. That is really stupid. I guess we can thank that stupid developer though.
I voted 40
Had me laughing hard
All I see are doxxers getting doxxed. I can't hate that. I may not even like it but I can't hate it.
🫵😂🤷‍♂️
Their idea of fun is false allegations and doxxing. I'm glad this app got exposed.
"You get what you f**kin deserve!"
With anyone with the barcode haircut, I cant take seriously.
Lol! I thought the hacked named 4chan was dead.
So, just a side note. THERE IS NO UNHACKABLE SYSTEM! There are deterrents. If a good hacker wants to get in, they will get in. That being said, most cybercrime is because people leave themselves wide open. So harden your accounts(just google how to harden your digital self), and most hackers will skip you and go after the easy target.
"no one can have a fun time on the internet" You call an App where you dox men and rate them on date ability a fun time huh?  Here's a question for you, If the app was doxing women and rating them on their prowess in bed how would you feel about it? Think about it for a minute and answer honestly.
Tit for Tat.
Her hair looks like sh!t.
Bully Hunter vibes
Karma
Not one of them was under 140lb
Everyone should watch Stevie Knights reaction to all this.. Its pure comedy.
Fun part is that the "leak" or "hack" or whatever they call it... was litterally just typing in a website adress where they stored all the information, uncrypted. Like... you have acess to internet? gratz, you could have gone and check their entire database, no skill required.
So the cyber bullies got the uno reverse card. Strong candidate for karma existing.
"Taste your own medicine" ahh moments
It's beautiful.
Of course these women had bad interactions with men. Just looking at them would cause an undesirable interaction.
Kind of feels like somebody did this on purpose to expose all these men haters. And giving out men's personal information and addresses well that's Doxing. Now the world knows who these woke men haters. They got exposed hard. One word irony
260 lbs, big ooof 🤢
Typical modern woman behaviour.
All things approach equilibrium and that's why Karma always delivers.
How about a “Ho” app? Guys can see which chics put out, how many dates it takes, what acts they do, how good they are at each act, if they look good naked, etc. Apple wouldn’t allow that on the App Store because it’s a double standard.
0:43 the amount of aircraft you could land on all those foreheads is insane
wait, is the helldivers theme playing in the background when the editor is speaking?!  masterpiece!!!
If they hate or fear men so much, why are they even on a dating app in the first place? If heterosexual relationships aren't your thing and you see 'oppression' and danger in every word or action from a man - then date other women. Why even bother approaching men, doxxing them, or smearing them if you don't want them?
Fem-cels are something bro.
I have no sympathy.
"fun time on the internet" like doxxing men you hate? turnabout is fairplay
They're all 0s
LHW division. They would fought Chuck Liddel in ufc
☕
Bwahahaha😂😂 Joker-“You get what you f***ing deserve”.
The fact that they're trying to declare off photos what guy is a red flag, ladies the fact you use this app automatically makes YOU THE RED FLAG.
Correction to the editor - 4chan wasn't actively hacking this thing. Someone found that it was using a PUBLIC server with no password, then they posted that info to 4chan. It's the apps fault for not using a secure server and not using any encryption.
Gotta love how women will create problems and when men try to solve that problem, the women will blame the men for solving the problem that they created.
Those dudes look exactly how I expected them to look
the glasses... the hairline... the fit...  It's like ... a prophecy fulfilled. Lisan al-k'ren
It's sad that the app was built with good intentions, sadly it was handled so badly.
Oo they mad someone exposed them for being worse than the people they gather to spread false rumors in attempt to ruin people lives, maybe don't be a POS. Cry more.
4chan: 2 AWFLs: 0
"It'S tHe iNceLs!"
Anyone could predict her entire stance on life just from that fked up haircut.
The insane part is that these women are a three out of 10 at best and there are plenty of three out of 10 men that would marry them and treat them like queens, but they’d rather be alone, w wild
I'm wondering how much longer before a class action lawsuit goes forth and bankrupts the company
They don't look feminine, are you sure they are trying to date men? They look like my local lesbo bar. Asking as a woman.
Moe Howard called and wants his hair back 🤣😂
News flash when it comes to phone apps. MOST of them are completely insecure.  I never put my personal information into phone apps.
wow... never saw such bold faced lying about weight 😂
I thought that requiring government ID for something was racist? 🤔
4chan proving once again they are the greatest heroes
I’ve worked with female’s that worked with their boyfriends. And they would say shit like “I don’t like working with my boyfriend because I can’t have fun.” Fun to them was hanging out with other men and drinking. I was given advice from a married man that if there not married it’s ok , just don’t mess with married women lol. Dude was cheating on his wife and got his truck keyed by side piece.
So it was ugly, fat women who wanted to trash men...because none of those men were interested in them.  Serious question: can women in the US get any worse?  I mean, what's next for the as a group?
This reminds me of that one black mirror episode where people voted on who should be we killed on social media and, everyone who ever voted was killed in the end
Moral of this story is ... women are stupid.
The first girls look just screams I'm in a mental crisis.😂
cyber-ethics in development
Call Moby Dick bc she’s a big one!
The irony is, an app for women to swap tips for spotting red flags and share their dating experiences could have been a great thing. But once again what could have been a shield has been turned into a doxing weapon by orcs.
FAFO this is a mans world. sorry
Looks like the type of people who would use that app and have those types of views. Most of them probably can't keep relations so just blame men.
Women need a reality check
Edgar bangs is wild😂
They had it coming
... .--. .. .-.. .-.. .-.-.- .. -. ..-. --- .-.-.- --. ..-.
The sad part is that in a vacuum the Tea app is a pretty good idea. Women looking out for each other against predators. But we know it just turned into a "ruin this guy i dont likes dating life" echo chamber
That woman has more personality than you and your paid for subs, clown. Grow some hair.
Saying something is secure on the Internet is like issuing a global challenge what the hell did they expect 😂
As of this morning, a can of Dr Pepper was in the top 4.
I doubt this app can actually do anything to ensure women’s safety. It’s more likely designed to publicly judge and humiliate men who, for some reason, didn’t appeal to a bunch of feminists. In any case, this should be illegal. And the fact that it became the most popular app in the store for a while just shows who’s really to blame for the epidemic of male loneliness. Every single day it gets harder to feel anything for women. And I have THEM to thank for that.
1:13 most of them look like men.
Wasn't requiring ID racist?
Tries to use an app to doxx identities of men they didn't like or agree with.  Has their info inserted into the app, insecurely and it got leaked.  'It's ok when we do it'  How about no one doxx anyone?
Well. You lot made your bed.   Now lay in it.   You lot have for the last 10-20 years told us that you did not need men. You blamed us for everything. You created a movement where men can get easily falsely accused of SA and if its found out you lied then NOTHING happens to you for ruining men's lives.
0:50 The top left corner of the map. Lower Alaskan region or Canadian? Wtf how sad. 🤣
Love it :D
Wait this happened because of 4chan? Dang I guess they had relevancy again.
Their cognitive dissonance is palpable
Bro why are there so many femcels nowadays
tha tis the ugliest hair cut i've EVER seen WTF
These women are getting dates?
who is suprised? no normal women would even use this app, only bitter ugly women who cant get a partner are there
The fact that they dont see the very clear hypocrisy only keeps showing how prevalent double standards is
"Head on a swivel ladies" That advice is better before you step in the shit
They all not only have the same weight but same skeletal composition
4chan hit again the only place were legion make
The cognitive dissonance is so incredibly stunning. And none of them see it.  “We’re going to create a list of people that we don’t want to date.” And then when those same people get put in a list, they’re upset. I know for a fact I’m not dating anyone who was on that app
That's... a face.
She just gave it away! She admits "no one can have a fun time on the internet"  So you admit the app was about "fun", not "safety"
lol the DoD id is nothing special. Even a guy pushing a broom in one of their buildings gets a CAC
That haircut means she is dangerous or unstable
Who tf is cutting these girls hair 😂
I just want to give my condolences to the younger generation of men who have to deal with this level of fucktardation. I can’t even begin to understand the level of hyper awareness you have to be at, constantly, in order to keep yourself safe, these days. I’m almost 50 and my dating/chasing days are over so i don’t have to deal with this kind of garbage.
the photos they posted of the men, if that's real then these dudes have absolutely no idea what they've signed up for if I see "the stock".
Tea Spill even has ELO rankings on their leaderboard. I’m deceased. Top 50 and bottom 50. Seriously hit up this site before it’s down it’s absolutely hilarious.
One user was in the department of defense.. very interesting.
They always have those certain features, they are miserable, and they want all other women to be miserable. Those glasses, septum ring, over weight, unattractive, shat personality. Rather than become a better person, they rather pull other happy women down. But lets be honest, they only women really using that app are the uneatable.
Proves once again, this has nothing to equality but dominance when it comes to many "feminists".  If you truly cared about equality, then you would have no problem with a male version of the app doxxing toxic women or men being exposed for doxxing these women.
Jeezus that haircut and glasses combo is flatyering in the slightest!😂
And those bangs 😂
THERE WERE NO SECURITY MEASURES. IT WAS A SCAM TO MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE IDIOTS.
ofcourse mostly white women
Women acting like communists
OKAY THAT TEA SPILL GAME IS DIABOLICAL
These women truly want to be forever alone huh?
Looked myself up, says I carry a hammer everywhere I go OH i get jt
Look at all these broken useless women lol!!
Gotta love the piss-poor attempt at manipulative language.  "You don't want women to be safe on the internet."  Nope, and based off the leaks neither did they.
Lmao the pictures where it doesn’t even show a womans face have higher elo than the ones that do🤣
looks like an app for femcels
The hogs are mad.
Wrong list got leaked, I mean I’ll take it anyway but we’re still waiting for the other one.
These leaked locations is what to avoid,be safe guys
Yes, I forgot, responsibility, sucks.
Sorry these women are the ones men don't want anyway. To funny
Oh. I fEeL sO sOrRy FoR tHeM.
I know men, good, honest, hardworking men with authentic integrity, who have been targeted by female predators, female gold diggers, women dating that are scammers, and worse, as well as cheating, and it ruins them. And they don’t get to have an app to be able to watch out for the women. We still have to trust our gut and do the best we can, we don’t just assume all women are potential predator’s and cheaters, but when there’s something like this, where 4 MILLION, women, have signed up for this app, it makes me want to give up on the only women who are even worth dating anymore. It’s too much of a risk running into somebody and fearing wether my pictures are going to show up somewhere we don’t want them to be, and having things said about us that we don’t deserve. It’s too judgemental, too unsafe, and too unmonitored as far as wether they even believe they need to be held accountable for the things they do, what about all the men who aren’t bad people and have been having their faces posted around? I even know one. And he’s not even dated a single person before, yet some women in my area were rating him, and it turns out a girl from college saw his face and recognized it, and showed it to him. He literally cried, he’s such an innocent person, and yet he got labeled a red flag just because his face looks intimidating for some people. Even though he’s sincerely kind.
Lol asmondbronze turning into china.   Keep deleting my comments.   You support people who touch little kids. Nasty..
Cue in Hoes Mad
as a dev the fact this app was even allowed on Google Play Store is absolutely insane. this app was created to dox men and Google should have never allowed this app on its platform. i hope Google gets sued for MILLIONS...........meanwhile small dev teams can't get a simple game on the app store. crazy.
And you want to tell me that these women aren't incels?😂
If a woman has that kind of haircut, she's not dating- she's on the hunt for someone to ruin.
If femcells are angry, something right is happening.
Play stupid games win stupid prizes
It’s funny how all the guys being gossiped about on that app are attractive successful looking men, and all the leaked images of women are Grendel lookin 200lb hogs. They probably mad Chad isn’t attracted to them so they’re upset trying to ruin his reputation to make themselves feel better. Female loser epidemic on display.
Why are all liberal chicks ugly?
The millennial Karen haircut is the tiny micro-bangs.
That haircut gives me nightmares
There was a website like this back in the day, we destroyed it by submitting random people from our school's yearbook lol. I wonder what would happen if they made a men's app to have secret affairs to cheat on and it got leaked. O wait, we have double standards.
I honestly don't see the harm in the app... it's a two-edged sword, or rather a two-sided shield in this case. They feel safer because of it? Sure, whatever, but also normal guys have lesser chance of getting catfished by these whales, lesser chance of interacting with them in general, in my book that's a win.
Fun!? That was fun for them? Sexism really is still around and women are keeping it alive
The glasses, the weirdo bangs..Ick.
The women using this app look exactly like you'd expect women complaining about and trying to sabotage/dox men would look like. A bunch of ugly women and lesbians.
Length of Bangs is Directly proportional to how much fun you want the world to have.
When the feds decide to take a day off and play in their online sandbox…
Do your driver's licenses have a weight category? :D
Just when ya think you'd seen everything,  karma pulls the 'hold my beer,  watch this'.😂
Big backs, big backs. What ya gonna do, whatcha gonna do when they come for you
Imagine if they made an app where men left reviews of women. It would be considered misogynistic and rapidly banned off of the app stores.
Ugly bints
They hippos and elephants brother. Oh boy
still hoping someone sues em to hell, none of this shoulda been legal in any country. anything that auto opts you in to any personal info (like those heritage stuff) should be unlegal
All their weights are listed! 😂😂😂
Stay single brothers
They are scared of their safety as if anyone would care about even care looking at them..
love the first lady says "women cant have fun on the internet" meanwhile some women on the internet got visa/master to remove the fun on the internet
S2_Underground video is a must watch.
Only 2/10 femcels would use such a app
Why can’t I find this map anywhere on the internet?
Why do they ALWAYS have the worst haircuts you've ever seen
The mentally ill they/them obviously does their best to make themselves look unattractive and angry...
I KNEW THEY LOOKED LIKE THIS
Isn't that also illegal to store personal data about the men without consent
It’s hilarious how they’re all ugly and judging guys who would never date them to begin with - the best part is attractive women don’t have this problem which is why most of them don’t use this app
Hail 4chan. Put some respect on the name.
women vs accountability once again
This is just Karma, i don't even understand what they are mad about, they are mad their doxxing got exposed or they are mad they got doxxed? They can't be mad about both, because that would show they lack human decency, are hypocrites and should be in jail together with the hackers instead.
Another bunch of "looker's".
Giant glasses ... Nose rings ... Fat ... Is always the same suspects
Hail 4chan
Ultimate tea
Interestingly, the guys who appeared on the app look pretty good.
Basically all the overweight, liberal heifers
Oh how the turntables have turned.
Greenpeace will be busy hunting all those whales and bringing them back to sea
All I’m saying is that I’m not going to listen to a “woman” that looks like an Orc from Middle-earth.
"fun time?" these toxic ass fugly & mad garden tools were having "fun time"? Just imagine if men had this sort of app huh? would tyese these toxic ass losers consider it fun time then huh?
4chan is making a comeback???
I really feel as if TEA was made specifically to expose women like this. The lack of security seems intentional imo.
Woman here. I wanna talk to the 3 ladies in the chat: Girls, if you don't trust yourself to get to know a guy, to take it slow, and be sensible about dating, this nonsense app will not help you. It is not a background check and cannot replace common sense. 👍 Good talk.
Also comically karmic: it appears none of the men discussed in the Tea app had their info leaked, it was only the women.
Like they say in StarCraft DAMN you ugly 1:34
Were at it agains guys , we it again , goddamnit
Yeah and guys using Ashley Madison were "just having fun" too.
Girl no you can't say incel with that haircut lmao
1:02 Not the super earth anthem XD
I'm sure someone else has said this but this isn't just a leak, somebody threw all this tea in the harbor.  It's the Internet tea party lol
tryna have fun not on my watch
its Gru, gru made the app. why these wokies trying to look like super villains?
Living a life full of negative emotion is the easiest way to get the same thrown straight back in your face.
Notice how they all chopped u cant find a normal looking one😭🥀
Hello Pot, my name is Kettle.
5'3 190 lbs........
Sooooo they're calling everyone incels while actively partaking in incel behavior themselves.... In "private"?  Yeah that's not insane at all. These same women are control freaks, have double standards, like i bet they can do things you aren't allowed to and you have to be ok with it. That's the mentality
Them glasses and them bangs says that the "fun" she had on the internet was trashing all men consistently. She's a femcel.
Not just the glasses. Her hair is z disgrace.
Holy chopped.💀🥀💔
These girls are just chopped.
Society socially correcting in the most obscure way
Understand a man created this app.
I can see why these people had hard time keeping their relationships intact.
How does this shit even happen was it even 12 months when that tranny won the court case against the other women only app
1:01 I recognize the Super Earth anthem when I hear it. For Democracy
is that helldivers national anthem playing in the background? I legit looked around if there was a "Rising The Flag" objective nearby.
These people look like homunculus
Proof once again, that the “best” are ALWAYS the worst.
It was not ok that this app existed. No good woman was on there.
Ho3s mad cause they got doxxed for doxxing 😂
Karma
worse? thats better
How are you gonna dox people without the thoughts that you gonna get doxxed some day too lmao.
Its a dog eat dog world 😂
There was a similar Japanese App were women cataloged men based on their status called the ranch or something like that, it made some noise but overall no media covered it, I expect the same here.
imagine using your government issued id to sign up for something where you talk shit. there's no way people are that stupid... oh wait
the fog of  war has been lifted
This is how some people ended up being burned at the stake and drowned in the 17th century.   Spreading gossip about people usually doesn't end well. Yes, some people might be saved by the gossip but it is far more likely that many more innocents will be cursed.   In between, everyone will be paranoid and incentivized to take advantage of others. It can quickly get out of control just like mobs. There are no good outcomes from this kind of app, not even if it was secure. Eventually, at scale, it was bound to destroy a lot of people's lives, innocent and not.   Gossip and "tea" is often portrayed in movies and tv as fun, funny, silly or naughty. No, it is dangerous.   If I have to tell you this, if this is news to you, if you are too dumb to have figured out why this is bad for everyone, then you should let other people decide for you whether or not to use apps like this.  Please do not repeat.
Girl you haven't been 180 lbs. Since 10th grade.
This is literally the female incel society.
Got leaked because of shoes
They look exactly what I figure the tea fans would look like.
I bet most of these women's complaints were, "He left as soon as he saw what I really looked like".
If your idea of having fun on the web by trashing men? That’s not fun it slander and defamation. And it’s sweet justice that since you were exposing men’s personal stuff on TEA, you all had your personal stuff exposed, as well.  Justice and karmas exists…
No more hiding behind filters on Tea huh? 😂
lmaooooo
“Anyone wearing those glasses, doesn’t want you to have fun”.   - A.G.
1:19 foolish women, the internet is never safe 😂
Their presence in our lives are but moments of misery for us. For them those moments stretch out across their entire lives. It's a pity they can't be honest with themselves but some folks are unconstitutionally capable of that. It's up to each of us to try to be better people because that's how we get better people. Standing on business means saying I was wrong and trying to make it right. Not putting it off on somebody else. Hoping everyone has a beautiful day, even them. Sounds like it's the day they need. One love 🤙
Some parents must wonder how they went wrong.
Okay, now men, make an app that tracks these women... The app will just be "Check if your date is a Tea user to protect yours safety"
Ah the usual haircut
The only way this entire situation could be funnier is if it was a woman who hacked and leaked the app data. xD Then it'd be 'So much for y'all thinking a man was behind your karma'.
They always look the same...
Women shot themselves in the foot; they make an app that is their own kryptonite. If roles were reversed, the funny thing is men would never do women like that normally.
People people people, didn't anyone learn the lesson after Shia LaBeouf posted an innocuous picture of himself outside a house with no other info.  In short time the 4Chan folks found him.  Oh the irony of the doxers getting doxed.  The one (probably more) using their DoD ID for this app, did break regulations.
Well, well, well How the tables have turned
To be fair, all women look like that at their worst.  Just amazing they selfied at this exact infinitesimally precise cosmological worst time point.
discord now is asking for ID .... lol think of the possibility XD
How come they always have glasses and goofy ass bangs!
Women =/= Accountability
Before Social Media, one of the basic rules of the internet used to be,"Never give out your real name, address or, personal photo's".
Well, at least they're admitting that the app had nothing to do with "protecting women" when saying "guess there's no having fun on the internet, especially if you're a girl!".  Their "fun" was ruining men's lives.
She's jewish
I’d like to see more content on this. It’s all seems like a comedy sketch.
tea app breaks all manner of data protection act clauses ... people are going to get their butts clapped.
And people wonder why men are done with women
Toxic people trying to judge people  toxically and getting instantly karma is satisfying.
These are the women online freaking out that you're dating a girl in her 20s
It's always hilarious when people want anonymity for themselves but no one else. No surprise that a majority of them are... well rounded, physically. It's ok, they will protest about abortion something that they will never need and forget about the issue like their skyrocketing blood sugar. Thank God that these people go out of their way to stop their own reproduction.
Wait, was that the Super Earth anthem?
Fix your ridiculous bangs lol
Using gossip, snitching and honeypot operations (osint, humint) to build an intelligence network is actually kind of impressive. Wouldn't be surprised if they got hacked by some government agency who felt they're cutting in on their action. "They're taking our jobs!"
Welp dating just got simpler. Cross reference any woman who used the app. Immediate nope.
My deepest sympathies to this mentally unwell group. May you forever be the victim in your fantasy world. Now reverse the genders and guess their reactions to an app that discussed women and shared their personal info.
4chan attacked on reddit’s womens app about stalking men and leaked all the retards on that app
Judging by the clients, they should have called it Gorlokbook.
Women aren’t allowed to have fun on the internet? I like that. Let’s keep going with that.
Oh but when the tables flip all of a sudden they want to cry foul play
The biggest own goal ever.
"Rules for thee, not for me."
The problem with double-edged swords is that they cut both ways...
Remember.  "It's okay when WE do it" is not a bug of Western Leftism.  It has been an advertised feature on the box since the "Enlightenment."  There's a reason The French Revolution became the Reign of Terror in a matter of months of them getting power.
Totally nonsensical to have an app like this. If a woman, or anyone really, liked their date, why would they advertise to competitors that this particular person was a great catch? The only thing I saw that might’ve been worthwhile was “is this person married.”
Your culture is fucked. Enjoy Americans
there are more keyboards in the teaspill top 20 than women.
Such a terrible shame that the app designed solely for gossiping women to doxx men, whether rightly or wrongly, has itself resulted in them being doxxed, and the worst thing I've heard thus far is that the women's pictures are being mocked since they are overwhelmingly overweight and unattractive in the first place. "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." - Galatians 6:7 (that also applies to women by the way 😉)
I'm sorry if guys did this it would be on the news for weeks with new laws against men and monitoring chats, this is never ok...  ladies just think if your man did this🤮
Rare 4chan W
Why ALL the woman look EXACTLY like the Stereotype  This timeline aint real no more 🤣🤣🤣
Would be funny if one of the 4chan users that did this was female, oh how the turn table turns
Guys there already going through a lot, just look at them. 😂😂
We went from Epstein list to NPCs list in 48h. Damn
New Internet Historian cinematic incoming! 😁
what i got doxxed from using the doxxotron
Women who are not part of this. You’re fine  Women who are a part of this, you truly are a failed person. And I hope you never find a good partner to be loved by. There’s a level to where you shouldn’t stoop to as a human being, and when it comes to deciding to respect yourself but not others when it comes to privacy, and being like this, it’s very low.   I’m so ashamed of the kinds of things I’ve seen recently on the internet but this one really does hit the top 5 for me. Having an app where women who likely have never been in a proper healthy relationship and also are likely the type to be toxic and harmful to others and abusive, going around openly judging others who they absolutely haven’t ever dated or seen, yet put claims on them as if they have, it’s so gross. I just wish people were raised right and that we were able to trust each other. If you don’t want people to know things about you, you shouldn’t be showing things about other people. Treat people the way you want to be treated and just try being a decent human being. It really feels like the majority of women out there right now are such a low quality of human being on all scales that it’s feeling hopeless for so many men. And the fact that women openly encourage cheating because they assume guys do, it’s so wrong. I’m so tired of the way things are, I’m never going to date somebody unless I know generally what kind of a person they are, not just dating initially, but going on a few dates and spending time with them around other people, how they treat the working class, how they treat strangers, how they treat themselves. God I just wish people were able to take a step back and think before they do things.
Red flags on a woman: Goofy looking glasses Cow nose piercing Tattoos that are questionable
Why are all these women "eww brother eww"
Remember kids, if an app requires an ID, it's about as safe as a women's shelter ran by Bill Cosby.
😂🤣🤣🤣 shits savage
Men strike back with the "bytch" app
I am rather single virgin at age 50 than be with some of these women showed here
The amount of incels  in these comments is unsurprising 😭🤣
... what ID requires your weight in it?
The more it goes the more I tell myself women right to vote was a mistake
Sweet, sensual justice! :D
🤢🤮
This is the best social experiment i've ever seen in my life. 9000 iq move. Ugly femcells exposed. 😂
Of course it’s all ugly and unwanted annoying women. Entitled losers
yeah theres an unwritten rule in the hacking community that there is always a bigger fish. This is why you dont hack/dox/dos people. Because you will gain the attention of someone who does it better than you and you will be curb stomped like youve never been curb stomped before.   "women not allowed to have fun on the internet"   No. You just walked into a battlefield, set up a castle, planted a flag, and told everyone to fuck off theres nothing they can do about it. Sorry that isnt how the game is played sweetie. Ur castle is about to be griefed in ways you didnt even know were possible.
And now they are crying over spilled tea
0:43  4Chan...  *Inhale exhale*  *OF COURSE IT WAS 4CHAN WHO DID IT.*
The new cast for the next Lord Of The Rings movies. You know what I mean.
Way to go 4chan!
that fringe ('bangs' for you Americano's) should be a criminal charge.
Men are scared women laugh at them. Women are scared men will kill them. Women have to date their apex predator, partners, dates  and obsessed stalkers are how women die the most. And you think it's funny, but the root reason this app existed was trying not to get killed or graped by men.  I'm glad you all think this is hilarious but now some of those women will get suffer more of that fate.  Most of you don't understand the danger some of these women are in now and it shows everyday how wilfully ignorant you all are about the daily lives of women and how men act.
Ignore the glasses look at the nose Assmongoldstein
It's funny how the people behind these things are the uglies that nobody wants.
The deliciousest tears.
The ugliest people are the loudest…
Every comment here is golden.
The mental gymnastics she is doing to play victim and blame everyone else when she was using an app with the sole purpose of doxxing people and spreading misinformation about them
4chan comes in clutch yet again.
When I supported leaking personal information in order to mock people on a social media platform, I never imagined that my personal information would be leaked so that I could be mocked on a social media platform.
Men and women are equal but only win it benefits me."
Don’t date “Tea” WAH-men.
4Chan proved itself once again o7 Good work soldiers
Is this app for cave trolls.
Holy crap they look exactly how you expect them to
They all look like freaks
Reputation destruction, this app was only meant to attract psychopathic women and now they have been exposed.
And 90% of what was posted were just fantasies.
So the app is strictly for dikes then?
Once again it's a case of "It's okay if we do it"
just a guess.. the app was created by a diversified person who probably vibe coded the whole thing.  cause that’s how they roll… 😂
I assure you, that women is gonna call this incident their "9/11"
Its insane to me that they consider everybody ELSE nasty, but not their own terrible behavior on that app. Making up egregious lies isn't "fun", it's pathetic.
These people want their app more secure than voting...how about that?
Woke mind-virus.  😂😂😂😂
Wth would want to date these toads?
How long til the next Tea app
Talk about the american eagle sydney sweeney ads
All these women need therapist and need to hit the gym. I need some self-awareness, especially the women with piercings and tattoos.😂
her hair pisses me off
ahhhh the turntables. justice.
Don't worry, the pretty ones also don't want to date you. You make yourself dislikable by being misogynist and racist.
What's crazy is that any of these women thought they were dateable in the first place. ☠️
1:29 i loved her performance in LOTR, so sad she fell in the volcano
Hypocrites: Oh no, we're being doxxed and judged.
someone should start an app letting men know where these women are
Even in the fog of war, tanks are visible. LOL
Isn't blaming the app just victim blaming? I mean they're the ones that were targeted attacked? Or are they saying that they weren't wearing enough cybersecurity so were asking for it?
How come all their hair lines are that of a crazy person
I'm a lesbian and downloaded it to see if my ex was being a pathological liar on there ( she's hacked me and don't crazy shit) women can be ruthless
The Super Earth Anthem was a nice touch
It’s okay when WOMEN do using the app but the min THEIR INFO is shared without THEIR PERMISSION, RED ALERT, RED ALERT. IRONY & KARMA IS SO DELICIOUS 😆
They forgot to post about 95-99% of the user photos. Oh.. nvm.. they're sharing those with the bros, in private, and whackinit together.
1:47 Seriously bro? You had to do it? I was having my breakfast you fucking psychopath.
The haircut spoke long before the lips moved.
"He ghosted me" Oh no the horror. How did you survive?
Jesus christ, these femcels are all heavier than me while being shorter than me.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely amazing! Unluckyyyyy
When they do it: HAH HAH INCEL When we do it: NOOOOOOOOO
Btw it’s a “chopped man epidemic” but all I see is whales, ogres, orcs and fucking goblins.
Thank the Lord for internet Dudes- I just fix shit, I’m not a social media guy, I just watch J*wtube and mind my own business
Why do these hags have a bowl cuts?
I’m like 99.99% sure that app was made solely by women as well 😂😂😂 of course it’s a piece of shit coding wise when it comes to security
this reminds me of when that ...ashleymadison? website leaked and all the cheaters pitched a fit about it🤭 both groups separate but equal shouldnta been on those websites to begin with🤭
If men had made such an APP with all that data about Women, would that be ok? No, it would not be ok. They wanted a List of people to avoid, 4Chan provided one too, enjoy girls ♥
At this point it wasn't a leak, it was a flood.
"not gonna stay safe on their watch"... Seriously? The amount of hate swirling around that app from women that look like they're from the Hutt clan is gonna get men hurt and/or deleted irl. We know how these kind of apps work. They're just echo chambers. This app could easily cause coordinated attacks on men.
The official femcel app
Boys we should make an app for men only to judge on physical look of females only
An ex doxxed me on that app and told me about it, I reached out to their support multiple times requesting removal of my information, didn't hear anything back. I'll tell you, it couldn't have happened to a more deserving company.
trixsy hobbitses
Why did that app ask the for their weight and height?  Was probably a honey pot all along 😂
Can 'trans women' access Tea with ID or would they be refused and considered men?
You bastard Americans leave tea alone!
Some of those 4chan suers gotta be ex-CIA
the same hags that started feminism in the first place. i wish normal women knew that these women are why they are forced to wake to an alarm every day to work a job they hate
" ITS VECTOR! "
Somehow palpatine returned
Bait and switch, hahahahahahah
My great granny always told me, when you point a finger at someone, you have 3 pointing at yourself.
They don't like the taste of their own medicine.  Why aren't she in jail yet?
Always keep in mind that to these people, having a "safe" internet means making it very unsafe for you.
I cant lie is it just me or is this the most loser shit, anyone can ever be on?. Like you really sign up on a app date or have relations with someone and rate them for other ppl to judge. Lemme explain something ladies this is something that not even the most braindead highschool boys do. Grow up
Can't wait to see how many of those things get fired from their jobs for this. I sure af would fire any female that worked for me of i knew they used this app
This Tea app was a stroke of genius by the CIA. Almost good enough to get us to forget about the Epstein list.
OMG. I can hear Super Earth anthem in the back. Jesus. I thought I've started Helldivers 2 by some "strange" muscle memory XD
Retards
It's only appropriate somebody nasty hacks and leaks nasty peoples info... The undateables! The next block buster movie!🤣
US department of defense? Boyi thats gona be a monday morning conversation😂
"You get what you f***ing deserve!!!" quote comes to mind.
It's a reverse misogyny. Also, not surprised that unattractive girls are the most haters, this makes a lot of sense
why are they ALL fat
This wasn't even a hack, they stored all the data in a publicly accessible storage bucket. All you had to do was type the url into your browser, lol
"Those are a HUUUUUGE Beaches"
Why does their ID have their weight on it, considering its something that can change ?
It’s unfortunate woke Karens breeded now look at all these ugly nose ring big glasses females
They all look EXACTLY like how you'd imagine
They thought they were slick 🤣😂
They spilled the tea.
her bangz....they look like a 2 year old child cut their barbie doll hair...
1:01 Who the fuck Is playing democracy's theme in the background 😭🙏
don't make apps with vibe-coding if you don't know coding, people :D
Woman use new "dating-app" to dox men, but then get doxed themselfs... karma is great
People should let this go. Two wrongs do not make a right. Leaking the images exposed the hypocrisy. That’s fine, I get it. But now out of spite people are continuing to degrade these people. All this will do is continue to drive a wedge between men and women. Just be kind to people. Forgive them and move on. Don’t play the same game.
For constantly complaining about what constitutes consent, these Women sure did not care about getting any from the Men they openly disparaged complete with Pictures and Locations
I love democrasy
PROBLEM GLASSES
I found Epstein in there.
This is totally gonna be an episode of "Law and Order SVU" saying the app was to prevent grapes and how bad gamers are and there is a gamer hacker serial killer using the data to attack women who rated him badly
Ozempic needs to sponsor that app
Someone spilled the tea.   I'll see myself out...
Lol is anyone here ild enough to remember George Carlin saying  " The women who are against abortion are women you dont want to have sex with in the first place " I has come full circle boys  Old George would change his toon today
Why American IDs have weight on them?
Don't underestimate intelligent people fuelled by sheer spite.
How does that haircut scream I key Tesla's? I shun theses freaks. You should too.
This app should 100% exist. Why? All the dumb women will stay out of the dating and gene pool. Save the headache for my fellow man. (I did THE smartest thing ever, marry a foreigner)
The tea has been spilled.
Unfortunate backlash such a shame
why do they all have those ugly haircuts?? 00:10 edit: and see through weirdly shaped glasses
That “woman” is not straight
Of course they'll all fat losers
Don't hate women. There are plenty of good ones out there.   Make sure to keep growing in significant ways so you are able to attract a decent woman.   If your effort isn't enough, then it's okay to look abroad but make sure expectations align, which often is a major issue with foreign cultures.
Incels at it again calling out the incels using the app.
Nothing Wrong with an All Women’s Social Media but a Doxxing Website ain’t cool.  Tea is the Later, therefore not cool.
Never forget Sean Connery had a real good cure all for women
Those things using an app and should be just happy anyone is talking to them.
Imagine giving a random ass app all that information freely
Nothing is beyond our reach
0:05 to avoid accountability, play the victim 🤣
accountability for thee but not for me
I don't think the app was hacked the information was so fat it capsized and everything just spilled out
You wonder why they're so bitter, and then you realize they look like this. Getting rejected repeatedly has hurt you, hasn't it, ladies over at Tea? I'd feel bad for them if they weren't so toxic.
So it's the fault of the doxxers and the app. Not the women on the app who were bitter and angry. These women take no accountability.  😂😂😂
Who thought giving service providers your ID was secure
Women ☕
Whoever leaked it is a HERO. I love it
I don't agree with this but I think people should be able to access criminal records for free, to vet who they date, who they rent a home from, who they buy something off facebook marketplace from etc.
this sh*it made my day
Really funny that if those women had mens attention, they wouldn't be mad about those men
The glasses def say crazy, but the labubu haircut say NUTS!
It's really nothing all that new, guys. There have been these kids of women around forever. We used to called them "Old Bitties" and "crazy cat lady". Same women who honestly hate everyone, especially men.
WTF is wrong with her bangs @0:00
the women on there are hideous
The leaderboard is crazy though.
We do we keep trusting these companies with that amount of information?
Well well well, if it isn't the consequences of their actions.
On the bright side they clearly could make a killing if they turned into a dating app for men who really like fat girls.
Not only did they want to dox and harass men, they wanted to be able to do it indiscriminately to random men who didn't opt into it. Meanwhile, the only women who got exposed were those guilty of taking part in it, not a single innocent person in sight.  These are very low quality people at the end of the day and the problem is, it's not a small percentage of the population that would've ended up taking part in that app.
Nobody twisted their arm to show that AI App A selfie and their ID, better yet, people usually tell you to guard that info
I'm ugly but there's always someone that's uglier.
It's really sad that feminism has been warped into this caricature of itself where too many women believe that it means that they are both empowered and victims. That they should be able to do whatever they want - and saying "no" to them means you're a misogynist - but at the same time, nothing is ever their fault, including the consequences of their own actions. It is a childish perspective and beyond tiresome.
Coordinated group of 4chans intelligence send me 😂
I cannot get over her bangs. Did the barber mess that up on purpose or is that a trend?
I'm almost 6 feet and weigh roughly 170. How the hell does someone 6 inches shorter than me even get to 200 pounds, let alone be the same weight as me?
The Super Earth National Anthem playing at one point in the video was a nice touch lol
This is a website for low iqs. No one has time for bullshit that has a full time job and is a responsible adult. I can smell those pictures through the internet. Yeesh
Fatties!
I somehow missed the part where they put their real identities and info there.
Based 4chins strike again
Goblins, orcs and ghouls. The lot of them
Love the Super Earth Global anthem playing in the background. FOR DEMOCRACY.
She cuts her own hair amd it shows
All fugly over 30s that cant get a man no matter how drunk they are.
has the url/link long been deleted?
the male only version of this app was banned by the playstore within days. and women still use the "we cant have anything BECAUSE we're women" cope.
This explains everything.  Every square milimeter of America is infested by sexists.
Holy shit this is embarrassing. What are women doing? Did they think anyone was going to let this slide? I fucking knew this shit was going to happen eventually. Get rid of Tea please what a bunch of losers…
Gentlemen....... We got em.
They all look exactly as I would have imagined 😂
why these women need to worry about the dating market at all? This is not their fight.
Karma said “allow me to introduce myself”
😂 women.
No Fun Glasses should be the  WARNING
They call me Hograider...
Karma.. it is a thing.  Makes me wonder if they were foolish enough to think that all of those 'red flag' guys were actually guilty of what their accusers said.  Makes me wonder of they had even a miniscule bit of doubt about the veracity of the other women on the app.   Because no woman has lied... ever.    :/  End of line.
Men don't get together to talk about women.. women on the other hand, get together to talk about everybody.
Definitely works at Starbucks the haircut is screaming that also the apron
Ashley Madison customers weren't victims and neither are these women
They wanted to expose and hurt men while they stayed anonymous. 😂😂
"The incels are at it again." - woman in a platform that seems primarily used by embittered femcels.
HOLY HELL 😮ITS THE COLLECTIVE OF CHOPPED
Imagine looking like that and calling someone else an incel.
Every last one of them should be sued for defamation character
Classic woman moment  ☕️
So is this app for liberals bc they all look like liberals
Anyone got the url description for the teaspill rating game? Google's trying to censor it up 😂
"Girls just want to have fun."
Funny if we did this to them it would be a massaging Mystic hateful and somehow a crime. But yeah they can do this to men and get no defamation of character charges all while the sky isn't as safety for women. I'm so sick of everything needs to be safe nowadays that way have to been the rules and justify everything. The other part is how could you believe any woman's reports on the apps? As they are statistically proven that they lie more, cheat more, more domestic violence, and bitter? Who's to say that 95% of their data that they're putting into this app is falsified?
A list of female incels all fat and ugly lmao
ngl this is such a satisfaction
"I guess women aren't allowed to have fun on the internet," says the people who would absolutely crash out and start threatening platforms over any app exclusively for men, never mind one in a similar vein as this one.
No matter how annoying someone is, no hairstylist should be allowed to do this 0:02 to someone’s hair.
If their think cyberlibel is fun time. Then jail is just a room 😂
Unsurprisingly they look exactly or worse than I imagine
THE BROTHERHOOD IS COMING FOR YOUR PSYCHE 😂😂😂
Uno reverse 😂👌
who would of thought that the misandrist program wasn't really planned out well
She’s got that “I don’t wash my pussy” look
"fun time" = hating on half the Human Population for Self Gratification
And for the millionth time in my life I wonder why women are so incapable of logical thinking.
If men aren't supposed to have access to this app, does that mean that all the leaks came from a woman?
You know it's crazy if you're giving your ID to an app just to confirm your gender in order to talk crap about some guy
4Chan just released a new episode of the Undatables.
Complete lack of personal accountability, and completely oblivious to what they themselves were doing.
You talked about the glasses... good, that's correct.  But we're not gonna ignore the bangs-lion-mullet power combo.
260?!?!?! my god
i dont understand who they meant by "we", cus my gf have never heard of this app. Oh but i guess that's because my gf is actually hot
shrekfest
So they're getting mad about being exposed...while exposing men...yeah, sounds about right 😂
These Hillary’s are all the same
Evolution finds a way!🦕
look at that fucking haircut... anyone with bangs like that not only doesn't own a mirror, they want you to be as miserable as them.
They're doxxing men and they call that having fun on the internet and think it's perfectly normal. But when guys were found out that they were only rating girls in a private chat, they suffered huge retribution as a result. Double standards much?
They set up a government issued I.D. system to verify female only. But government issued I.D. allows men who identify as women, to use the app. So there were possibly men already using the app. Allowed in by their own systems that keep men out. 😮
No amount of security measures will save you from 4chan. You can hide, you can run, but history has shown us 4chan WILL find you.
I imagine the 4chan guys had quite a bit of fun.
How are you that short and weight that much and have any expectations in dating.
Even with the Geolocation no one would kidnap these people so at least they can count that as a win.
When they do it, it's for their safety and empowerment.  When men do it, they will scream misogyny and invasion of privacy.
A space ONLY for Women? Interesting, I remember when Men had spaces like that. Until Women decided they wanted to be in them, now they want THEIR own space. Imagine that.
social currency app that's nuts.
Even her bangs are running away from her
plot twist - The people behind Tea app were working to gather all undateable women by how much they disrespect Men as a whole (and not as individuals) on the app, and then leaked their info for all men to see who they truly are since people often have different faces for different people, and these women may seem nice on a dating app, but are ugly when not seen... Truly IQ plays.
Oh gosh oh no oh jeez the app that exposed every man added to it is now exposing all karen's on internet. How is this possible :o ?????
4chan intelligence Operation Hawaii Luau was a success.
Bois, we got em.
If they wanted an app to give a list of men that shouldn't be dated... well, OK then, but we should then be able to see the list of women who'd want to use such an app, so we can't date them.  Seems only fair to me.
Men will just engineer around the problem.
“ These nasty people exposing our toxic, doxing, reputation destruction app, how dare they.” If Elon could convert stupid to rocket fuel, these women would be getting us to Mars.
She has such an slappeable face. I say this as a woman.
Just make a 170+ pound section of tinder and under 5'5.... just get them out of the way asap
The Tea app should have been named Copium.
The fact that there wasn’t any bit of encryption on sensitive info. It was on a public server and all ya needed was the url
150 million women vs Accountability Female Logic:  We can post your info and talk crp about you behind your back all day.  But don't you dare do the same to us.  (I said Female Logic, but it should be Female Emotion.  Because Female Logic is an oxymoron - like a silent scream or a short skyscraper)
Just went to play the game leader board had me weak af 🤣
Nobody's trying to find anyone on that app . Yuck dude.
Thank you Tea for letting all of us men know what type of women to stay away from
doxxers got doxxed
Stay safe? Bitch, you tried to dox men you dislike. Take your 5head and go cry to your 10 cats.
Women are fucking stupid. Anyone giving their ID for an app to talk shit is the dumbest fucking shit they could do.
America is truly a frightening country
In the US you put height and weight on driving licences? Wow.
😂😂😂😂
These women look exactly how we suspected 😂
That I just fucking delightful. Turning their nature to Gossip, Rally and Shame against them.
Very important: Nothing was hacked. Everything obtained was freely available and unencrypted in publicly accessible URLs. All you had to do was type in the URL and the information was given freely. By case law, unencrypted information publicly available at a URL without signing in can not ever be considered hacking.
When are we gonna get the face piercing MRI story in the news?
This whole situation has me dying with laughter - feels real good
Oh it isnt the glasses its the haircut
How do cows use an app?
They dont have a chance, men were born for war.
Yep, women with "quirky" glasses are always the most insufferable people
I love dorks and geeks. They are so smart.
I honestly didn't think 4chan had it anymore to accomplish any missions like this. Used to do a lot more crazy shit back in the day.
"no-one can have fun on the internet" = talk shit about people behind their backs, posting information about them and how they should be avoided. Yeah, you don't like it when men do it, so don't you do it either.
Hypocrisy epidemic among women 😂
It's the psychotic fringe thingy that's usually a clear give away 🦔
The Game is funny. The Top 20 only has 3 actual photos of women in it. The rest is just pictures of objects like laptops, mice a dr. pepper can and one dude😂😂😂
I'm just 160 lbs. How could these women weigh so much more than me?
For ugly women the Handmaids Tale is a fantasy not a horror story.
*Helldiver Salute*
Pirate software said: "I hope your initiative gets everything that you've asked for, but nothing that you wanted."  A broken clock is right two times a day, as they say.
Does anyone know the link to that “teaspill” ranking site?
This is great. Not all heroes wear capes 🍻🍻👌🏆🙏
Unrelated to the content: why is this narrated by David Attenbrough?
You're welcome, We are done letting women do shit like this.
1:39 „it is only okay if we do it to you but if you do it to us you are the problem“ 😂
The funny thing about drivers licenses is they let you write down your weight and they dont measure it. So most of those cows are probably like 50 pounds heavier than whatever it says on their ID. 😂
That booger badge is a dead giveaway for sorors Dumberctapts Gargoyles Incorporated. The sDGI cult.Est. 2009
Women are incapable of understanding hypocrisy and accountability.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A bunch of pretentious, self-righteous, judgmental warthogs.
Aren't all these women lesbians lol
We let these creatures vote.
☕ women
it was easy to hack because it was made by women
1:32 OH That nose ring tels me dad left my mother when I was young ... Or I have self image isues
They say you get what you deserve.
most fun on there in a while
SPILL INFO GF
Thar she blows! A hump at the McDonald's! The Womanopottumus!
Obnoxious dork glasses? Bull ring for a unattractive cow? Nice haircut? TO HAVE!!!??? all check!!! Funny how they call otheds incels...
HD2 music W
She looks like she cuts her bangs with safety scissors. Anyway, was the app about having a "fun time" or was it an indispensable safety resource for women? I'm losing track of the narrative already.
i only have one thing to say to this:  DINGDINGDINGDINGDING HEEEERE PIGGYPIGGYPIGGYPIGGYPIGGY
Was this the list of pics and data of all naural disasters around the world?
Tea app users: We can slander men all we want, all while giving their personal information and doxing them! 4chan: How about I do it too. :D Tea app users: Wait, that's illegal!
You can't make this shit up
People are confused why they only used it to be salty and shit talk men... You're forgetting that ''Spilling the tea'' when referring to gossiping, is literally what old Karens and ugly women do to pass the time and feel better about themselves. No self-respecting, good quality woman, with a healthy mental state engages in gossip.
It is not over until the fat lady sings or,,, is on an app.
Dear lord, it's an entire app of Kaceytrons... _AAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!_
God bless 'Murica
"Me too" got "Me 0wned"
shit is hilarious :D
She ain't a lady if she ain't 280😂
I feel like that app was a trap for horrible women so men could get some safety and search up narcissists to avoid.
The woman cries out in pain as she strikes you
Is this app legal ? I guess in Europe it is not if you check it against the GDPR. And that can end up expensive.
If you go on one of those maps, it only points to the center of the city they are located in and not any actual addresses This means the leakers were more responsible with other people’s identifiable data than the website or any of its users
someone make a game for steam karen simulator  with the pics 😂😂
Women and accountability go together like water and oil.
I knew a very nice and cute girl in high school who now wears those same shitty glasses and is 100lbs heavier than before. I’ll let you guess what her political beliefs are.
"somebody nasty...", and she's not referring to the app's user base?
NO, YOU! lmao
The level of pseudo privilege and blind naivety to the accountability of what's going on?This girl is just, I really hope law enforcement catches her and just polls are accountable for all the doxing information she did on whoever she was talking about. You of nowhere to legally verify any information about any guy that was ever posted to this app. The creators of the app admitted that ninety percent of all accusations against men may, in fact, be false. And someone told you that you had a ninety percent chance of going on a boat, and it was not sink in the water, you would not get in that boat. So why would you believe ninety percent of false information about a guy?You've never met.
So they were actively leaking personal info, and then cry when they got caught and it happened to them as punishment? I call that a taste of their own medicine.
😂 women are insane
People need to learn to stop trusting software that is being run by someone else. Just self host your own services. There are free, open source, secure applications to replace these services that are irresponsible with your data.
Lmao trust me, you're safe. Nobody is trying to go for people like you.
Pottery 😂
I LOVE when irony is displayed.
remember gentlemen: the average american female is 5'4", 185lbs. just save that little tidbit
Boys, we haven't had such a glorious tea dump since the Boston Tea Party.
Exposing these dudes for having a preference and not wanting to date a sea lion. The nerve of those guys 😂
Hilarious!!
The female version of Incel, well well well...
Disgustingggggg
Holy land whales 🐋
So the Staff at TEA were all women, meaning the IT security people, were all women.  Another great example of ladies in IT, leaving their database open to the public.
Do yew seee what I seee~
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Honestly those females are so fucking tiring, no wonder all of them are single, jesus christ ...
They look like “cenobites”
One of my many fake identities apparently showed up there with multiple women claiming they got SA’d by it 🤣
It's bitter women the app.
Fucked around, found out, got fucked, not the way they wanted.
So it’s ok woman have an entire app to hate on men, but when it gets leak and we do it back to them it’s wrong
Women have been doing this with private FB pages for years.
Anyone I don't like is an incel
Do these women cut their own hair?!!? 🤣
With every passing day I find more & more reasons why I'm glad I never married...(And why I avoid women like the plague...)
GamerGate Vs TEA APP
Sounds like the tea app is a defamation lawsuit waiting to happen.
no wonder they don't care about the government databases, they actually want to make their own, but it turns out it's good, as long as they are not part of it, but just the users
You know, I hate to judge people based on appearance, but it seems like the nastiest and most anti-male women tend to be the ugliest and fattest?
It is as if they didn't know how the internet works.  Nothing on the net is safe
Love the Flag Raising Helldivers 2 OST
Was not four chan, its hardly call a hack, it was on public url
Man end up gstting a full list of verified red flags for free  Definitely not expecting this
Man I love men
W 4Chan
Let the suing begin.
If you store personal data for your app then data encryption is the most important thing! It is more important than user experience for your app!
LMAO. dudes just said ok welp how bout we grade you.
Hilarious comeuppance
There is this thing called Karma ladies.  lol.
So, apparently this wasn't even a hack. Everything was stored unsecured, unencrypted, on publicly accessible addresses. All you had to do was visit a URL and save image. To be that vulnerable to attack, it's practically guaranteed that it was intentional.
“4chan’s intelligencia” 😅. There’s a phrase I never imagined I’d hear.
all these chicks look repulsive. I believe at least 80% of them have that "oink oink," piercing. Typical radical feminists, possibly even dikes, wondering why men don't want them. It is suspect that a "department of defense," chick is on there. it's probably some sort of psy-op.
We should start our own app, call it 'beer' and we can warn other men about crazed local women
Purest form of irony. Lets all go on an app and dox men. Then the men use said doxxing app to dox users. Wow. This is hollywoo movie level
They didn't "gain access", it was stored by the app in a publicly accessible storage bucket. Something that's pretty easy to find the URL for.
So what did we learn? Maybe don’t go and sign up for a giant stalker app meant to psychologically harass men for the simple act of wanting to date a woman?   Crazy it even has to be said?
We got the Teamu list.
Unfortunate  But you win stupid prizes for playing stupid games
I can't take anyone serious who says incels and stuff like that, and my god girl change the bangs!!! Way too high on the forehead! lol
It's like different horde units from Warcraft hah.
And this kind of data leak is why giving biometric data to porn companies to verify your age.  Social credit brah ai is gonna be able to tell everything about everyone soon. Some of us been very very bad people, better keep a diary to explain your behaviour soon honesty to yourself is the only way you can account for how others and the ai will judge you.   Ai being the judge is dangerous
everytime i find a link to this shit it's already been removed by reddit of google, does anybody have a proper link?
"No one can have fun on the internet." Well, then stay away!
D0xxers complaining that their safety is now in jeopardy because of doxxing is peak
Specially if you are someone looking like that and judge other peoples look.
They shouldnt have called so many men "incels". Not justifying the doxxing, but, you know what they say, "play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
1:28 Note that the *leak* from the app wasn't even gotten through some kind of hack. The web app is severely lacking privacy protection ALL because they kept ALL the data in a publicly accessible database and NO ENCRYPTION. It wasn't even a hack, not even social engineering. It was more like natural selection LMFAO.
I'm going to point to a different issue and why I think its good that this happened. "We need NSFW content locked behind real ID verification so children can't access them!" Meanwhile app that uses ID verification gets hacked and all these women's info get leaked.
Yes, releasing men's personal informaton online is "a good time online".  I wouldn't doubt that the Tea app itself was a part of that co-ordinated 4chan leak itself.
Men should make an app called The C*NT app.
the logic behind the site... - these guys are assholes, lets DOX them 🤬  the logic behind the "hacker"... - these guys are assholes, let me drop a link 😂
I can't believe that app was even remotely legal.
Those girls swipe left to me on dating apps even though theyre objectively worse than me in terms of looks
I hear Helldivers music 🥲
doxxing for thee, but not for me
i want the link to that game please :D

I wonder how many men on that app had positive ratings? lol I can't imagine anyone that was put up on there to be judged ever had people telling others to go date them. These people don't strike me as the kind of people that ever end on good terms with anyone, and so if they can't be happy, why would they help anyone else? especially those they may have grudges against WHERE THE PEOPLE CASTING JUDGMENT WERE DUMPED FOR A REASON LOL.
"No-one can have a fun time on the internet."   Sweety, the people in your camp made not having a fun time on the internet a competition and then A LAW.   England having a real fun time on the internet right now because of people like you.   I do feel kinda bad for gals who turned to that website to actually use it to avoid bad dudes, but then found t was just a place for catty people to whine and spread rumors about their exes.
4chan  Intelligencia !
The glasses? What about that awful haircut? 😱
How is that app even legal?
The app was created, developed and supported by...men.  Women can't even hate men online...without needing men.
Thx for sharing those pictures brother, my ugly mug is the fuking Mona Lisa in comparison.
What’s up with these girls hairlines?
There's a rise of angry incel women
“I care not for your booing, I’ve seen what makes you cheer”
see, this is why you always disable your phone's location tracking unless specifically necessary.
Her haircut is a dead giveaway.
Bunch of unwanted ass people trying to keep pretty girls from getting men
Karma in its PUREST form, thank you goddess of KARMA.
We can't even doxx, harass, and defame random people for fun anymore, way to be lame internet
I thought this was a doxxing site not a horror site.
This is illegal in my country it was even in the news cause there was a facebook group doing the same thing.
Thank god this was US only. Ffs man its so stupid. Why do we need all of this seperarion from eacother like are we actually this dumb??? First wealth, then race now gender. Fuck off shitheads
Z.H. - this particular expressive commentary isn’t going to age well
It's all fun spilling the tea on others until it get's spilled ALL OVER yourself.. lol.. I hope all these women get sued...
Karma is great.
1:44  brother, I AM EATING!!  you know what, thats on me 😔
Am i going crazy or did this video have the Helldivers 2 music?
Wow it now makes perfect sense why women in movies and games are now all so ugly. Mystery solved.
Hgt: 5' 03" Eyes: Haz I also haz eyes. And noze and mouf.
I’m a man who works out for the last several years and most of those whales weigh more than me! Azmon was right it has always been just incredibly bitter and sad fat woman that are trying to destroy our culture. Department of defense lady weighs 220llbs gahd Dahm!
2:00 🐠
Orrrrrrr what you could do is just not be on an app that is blatantly hateful in the first place…….but you won’t do that will you.
lol the super earth Anthem in the background
More like "The reject department"
*IT WAS NOT 4CHAN. THERE WAS NO HACK. THE SITE PUT THE DATA UP, STUPIDLY, IN A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE WAY THAT ANYONE COULD HAVE FOUND. IT IS NOT SOME EVIL INCELS, BUT THE SITE ITSE,F RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INFO BEING OUT THERE.*
Interesting that she considers slandering men to be a 'fun' activity.
A man created the app, then executed Order 66.
"A fun time on the internet"   Trying to damage people's lives is her idea of fun
hey,in order to create such undateable people data bs,maybe its better you know what you are talking about in the very 1st place.Lets say...experience data???. . . Such frustrated human beings...comes to a point i feel pitty on them.
Another case of 'they can dish it out, but they can't take it.'  I'm so glad I'm  too old to care about this shite anymore.  And if you're gullible enough to send legal photo identification to such an ill-conceived, bullying app on the internet, see this as a life lesson.  Young people today have the entire catalog of world knowledge, so much more than any previous generation, at their fingertips, so much potential for doing good, and this is what they do with the gift of that knowledge; create AI s3x bots and tattle tale boards.
"Why can't you just let us have fun on the internet?"  Doxxed by willingly filling their own information into an app they knew was a doxxing app. That ruined people's lives. For fun.  We need to harness the physics of this. Not just zero self awareness, but negative. The opposite of a black hole.   Her brain is a region of space where light can never enter.
The game is just chef's kiss of an Idea
Apparently "a fun time on the internet" for women = doxxing and defamation of men who don't sufficiently please them on dates.  Disgusting. Letting them leave the household and vote was a mistake.
all these women are AVERAGE looking women ---- if u dont want to live in the truth, that only a few humans are the exeption but the majority is what u name "ugly" than .... well its on u just look at portraits of medieval nobility --- the best of the best, the richest of the richest, the beauties of the beauties -- THEY ALL LOOKED LIKE GOLUMS  how about u GO OUTSIDE and look how the people, all people, in a certain radius around ur location look like ...... maybe then u realize how the internet gsve u a wrong perception of how sexy the human race is
Tea was 6ft and so unfortunately the red flags were ignored 😔
I have a question for these folks, both the users of this app and the ones who made the app-  What is a woman?
Holy hell, they all look like actual trolls. Who all these men that you think are supposed to be dating you?
lmfao at the fact their BMI was leaked. There is no greater equalizer
Why are all of those girls both shorter than myself and heavier than myself? 🤔 Interesting correlation. But I'm married, no need for silly apps like.. obviously doxing people 😐
They weren't farming Tea, they were farming hogs
Who would've guessed it was a buncha unf*ckable Karens?
So the Tea App learned men which woman to avoind because they can not be trusted :) Thank you all Woman that particopated in this reverse psyop ;) I love it when a plan cones together (and backfires)
*Leaks others information* *gets own information leaked* "who would do suchhhh stupidity" 😲
Those ugly women never dated a single one of the attractive men. It's just a hate app meant to spread lies about men.
This needs to happen to that 3rd party company that stores the data for the online safety act.   Their "strict verification systems" are essentially the same thing.
Brought to you by: “We weren’t doing anything wrong, just having fun by shaming men.” But when men do the same for their own fun, suddenly it's a problem. So ladies, stay safe—and remember: it’s fine when we do it, but unacceptable when men do.
Taste of their own medicine.
so let me get this straight.. theyre leaking information of MEN on said app, but when their own info gets leaked, they play victim?
racemixing is the way. Your own women are pathetic
Worse? This is the best possible outcome.
I'm glad that in their attempt to make a database that catalogs people's date-ability.  they inadvertently created a database that catalogs people date-ability. fortunately, this new database only returns "non date-able" as an option, making it a clear reference tool for anyone trying to avoid disaster outright.
Lmfao the last thing she wants is for you to have fun he says. So fuckin true.   1:54 Golly. We are living in the weirdest timeline.
Whole coven of FUGLIES.
Unlike ozzys glasses ❤
Just stupid women being stupid women again
Yeah, as if gorlock the destroyer needs to worry about creepy men having her GPS location 😂
All the Kamala voters
Justice
More and more men are starting to wake up to the reality of dating. Women only want the top 10-20% of men and the rest can die for all they care.
Some other streamer said it perfectly ''fat bi*ches need to shut the fck up''
Why do I get the feeling that none of the people being doxed on Tea contributed to it's hacking? Meaning those who were involved did it just to be dicks lol.
This reminds me of a story I heard about a guy who owned one of those mugshot websites. Basically, if you get arrested, there are websites that will put your mugshot and arrest record up for people to see, and you have to pay through the nose to get them to take it down. They're basically an extortion racket. One of the owners of one of the biggest of these sites got arrested and his mugshot was posted all over the internet. It's not so funny when you get a taste of your own medicine, is it?
Instant karma
Turns out you can just make a up a weight on your drivers license, doesn't have to be accurate
Why would you sign up like this!
I feel like 90% are lib areas
I guess they spilled the tea HHSHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHA, I THINK I’M SO FUNNY
Find a land whale near you
Find a land whale near you
None of this would have even been a thing if online casual witch hunting or 'cancel culture' hadn't erupted from these people in the last decade. You reap what you sow, femcels.
Checking if someone is married or on a register, I can understand. But anything else is an opinion and subjective. That app is a massive libal case waiting to happen
The glasses and the bangs.. two major tips you’re dealing with a loon
What is the super earth anthem doing in the background
Who posts their DoD CAC online as a method of verification?! 😭
this is a black mirror episode
What a fucking ugly haircut.
She's got the most punch able face.
5 ft, 186 lb, NOT a bodybuilder…. Something just ain’t adding up 🤔
Why some of these girls look like they're inbred
Let this be a lesson for all : apps only have access to the information you give them.
This is why I don’t do dating apps. They’re untrustworthy.
4chan was so based in this moment FAFO
Btw if you haven't read about the "hack" I would look it up. Basically the devs left the database in a publicly available location by a URL if I remember correctly. Someone explained the hack as "They didn't just leave their front door open. they took everything inside and put it outside for anyone to take."
I wouldn't mind being called an incel by most unapproachable woman possible. It's like badge of honour.  PS. This never happened and is never happen to me anyway. In my country attractiveness scale for women seems to start at 4 compared to US one.
the game got me banned on reddit,  so be careful with what you post there. Cya on the other side i guess lmao.
So now that there is a "Tea app" to expose Tea app users (and access isn't restricted to one half of society), all these women suddenly cry about "security" & "privacy" 🤡 Karma's a b*tch 😂😂😂
Who would want to even go on a date with these train wrecks ??? Grosss 🤮🤮
"How do you write women so well?"    “I think of a man. And I take away reason and accountability.”
Women should lose the right to vote. There is a reason every culture makes sure they ain't bored in history.
So her idea of fun is talking shit about people behind their back.
0:42 THIS!! THIS is why forcing adult content sites to card users is a BAD idea! 🗣📣
All these angry 2’s and 3’s can’t even understand the irony of being upset about their details being leaked after using that abomination of an app 🤦🏻
Its always the damn TORTAS.
femcels complaining about incells  and they both mad because  noncells dont want anything to do with them.      it is hard to hear what these  lets be nice "females"are  saying  because they put that distracting  cow ring in the nose in all kinds 0f shapes and it just looks     🐽+💩
im surprised either of those two are trying to date men. they look they prefer other unattractive women.
At this point Tea was a set up. 😂
KarenFinder
those 4 spots with no geo location on the map are the last hope for america
Ah the tables have turned now they can't handle the world mocking them 🤣🔥
God bless America
how these bitches 4-6 inches shorter than me at the same weight lol (i know i'm not fit or skinny i'm just saying like where's all that extra mass coming from)
Pure doxxing. Whoever did that and participated in that - straight to jail.
And keep in mind, people always put the best photos of themselves.
Oh damn ! They “hot or not” them afterwards? LOL
Laughing in European. Your concept of freedom is laughable. No GDPR means no data protection. Enjoy what you voted.
Kinda fkd up for asmold to promote that rating website. Some people who's info was leaked could have joined for curiosity.  Anyways... the voted top 1 on the website is a picture of a logitech mouse, number 2 and 3 are literally nothing lol.  and number 15 is a doggo
Bash men while releasing their private data---Good Men hacking your shit site and doing the same to you---BBAAADDD I get it. You are the victims. Man bad, Woman good.  Have a nice life being miserable and alone!
Best nose ring ever.
Checking if someone's dangerous, married, an SO, or whatever, okay, I get it, that part I can't really complain about. But acting like no one on the app would ever blow anything out of proportion, or worse, lie... really. Imagine going out with someone, being fuckin' awkward, and suddenly you're labeled every single thing you can imagine to thousands of women. I already have anxiety around people in general, but now, it's like why would I ever go on dates. And I know, most normal, good charactered women probably wont care for it, but still. Obviously people shouldn't get doxxed, but holy shit, the ego on someone acting like they're the victim while ousting everyone else to the public... fuckin' wild.
All women programmers app too? Nhahahahahahahahaahhahahahahahahahahahabahah
Ah, an Ashley Madison leak for the women Truly, we have achieved equality 😂
Whack slitz yo
They must hate their life.
1:28 jumpscare
So basically the app was the equivalent….and this a big stretch wondering if YT will delete it….”Sleeper Karen”
FAFO
Wait, so the app was created specifically for defamation? Isn't that highly illegal?
what a bunch of dummies.... you really thought you could fight the internet
You can't even call this incident a hack because all of the data was stored in publicly accessed folder. This is entirely developer's fault. They basically asked for this to happen.
It was an unencrypted database attached to an open url. The owners of this app are going to get sued so hard that their grandkids will be in litigation. FTC investigation on behalf of women. NIL, slander and FTC lawsuits on behalf of men. This should be good
you just love to see it
Are you telling me that there were a bunch of women that tried to make a list of men that they hate and it was found out that the women wanting to make that list were all ugly fat undateable women. . .   Wow talk about the ultimate uno reverse
They all the same look, haircut, glasses and piercings lol 🚩🚩🚩🚩
This is absolute gold, it's so perfect it almost looks like a movie. The doxxers got doxxed 😂
The incels say and believe the things they say because of stuff that women and crappy men say. If you don't want incels around, just don't lie about things. Its like how many women and crappy men claimed that dick size was the only thing that women cared about. Then dumb guys with big dicks would spam dick pics everywhere thus creeping out women and making fools of themselves.   Girls, don't tell young impressionable men that all women are prostitutes and then complain when they all act like johns.

Common 4chan w
It's called getting taste of your own medicine.
"No one can have a fun time on the internet".. You know, all that fun we have doxxing men we dislike.. We can't have that fun anymore because WE got doxxed.  Hey hey, look over there! It's the consequences of your actions!
Only in the US. Anywhere else, decent country, it would have been profoundly illegal to create these kinds of databases of men or women.
Why do lesbians need an app about men they don't want?
Someone spilled the tea
I can see the benefit of warning other women about abusive men, but the exact sort of abuse everyone expected was the result. Women aren't immune to being petty liars or shallow materialists.
How about those pedos in government
Alright boys here's the addresses to deport them to Darfur!  This we they can experience every bit of inequality they always claimed the suffered!
As spoken by a wise man "Those who hate will not know love",  it's a universal law, you can't hate and love simultaneously, those who conduct hateful behaviour will never find love as long as there is hate occupying their hearts.
20 something years ago, Zuck made Facemash to rate hot or not now we have Tea Spill to rate the opposite.
And with 'somebody nasty' she means the people using the Tea app, right? Right? .... Right?
"guess we just can't have fun on the internet"  The fun in question: *gossiping and exposing men for bad behavior with little to no proof possibly ruining their prospects in life with no way to defend themselves.*
that green tshirt very unironically looks like a starbucks apron
Your barber f**ked your head up
What on earth is that haircut?
How is “gossiping, doxxing, and accusing men of crimes with no way for them to defend themselves” fun to you???
having the Helldivers music playing while choosing who's next is diabolical  😂😂
Great example of instant karma right there.
This app is a platform for mentally ill women to compete with each other in terms of being toxic and ugly.
"HOW DARE YOU BIGOTS EXPOSE OUR BIGOTRY!"
Tea Leak? We Boston chaps still remember that, eh?
Tbh I was happier before seeing these fa- I mean leaks, encrypt everything back please.
Karma is the most beautiful of them all.
WTF is up with that hair?   Never ever run with scissors.
Doxxer gets doxxed 😢 Karma is such a bi*
These fucking BANGS with these women LOL
Is that like the female version of the mullet?
I feel like this app was coded by a wo....Never mind.
You know your audience.  Attenburough voice-over is genius.  He knows the nature of animals around the world.
get what udeserve, so good, don't try to beat us in our world, woman made fun because we where nerd back then and now try to beat us at our own game? ahhaha, fool
Why would anyone ever actively do this? Women are sick sick creatures.
And the award goes to the app developers and their laissez-faire security.
“Apparently that wasn’t secure” — no f@¢*!ng sh!t?
Karma is a bitch
Karma is a bitch
This is the definition of "Everything that looks good on paper is bad in practice"
The intelligencia. The leader would be proud
Apparently and allegedly, a similar app but men sided was created in the past but the apps store took it down quickly... if true that really tell the privilege of women.
Women ☕
LMAO you expected an app that held ALL your data do not get targeted.. That's a damn black hat gold mine its gonna be more targeted than the bank and almost more than the NSA.
Wtf is that hairstyle 😭😭
But what if the posts about me were just a bunch of hot ladies talking about what a catch I am?
I didn't know about the tea app but This is DESERVED. They earned it
The usual suspects.
Lol no F-king way the weight on the ID's are right! 180-190 pounds and you got a double chin! Aint no one believing that shyt!!! 😅
NOSE RING ALERT/ MOE HAIR ALERT
Justice has been served.
What is a WOMEN? Weird how the left suddenly knows the answer to that question when it effects them directly.
Tea Bagged 😂😂
4chan is more efficient than the FBI and CIA combined
Be single. Live your best life with your guy friends and spend this short life having fun with total freedom. The internet has broken and manipulated what was once beautiful and it doesn't exist anymore..
4chan inteliency MI4Chan
They call everybody incel, but according to their aspect... they're the real INCELS (emphasis on INvoluntary). Cause let's be real... who would touch any of these even with a 10ft stick or the light of a lantern?
0:19 The Helldivers 2 anthem going quietly in the background did not go unnoticed!
If all their account activity got leaked too they should get sued by the men targeted for defamation
Gen Z "females" all look like aboriginal tribesmen.
When you look like a 3 you can't have the attitude of a 10. Nobody will put up with it.
What a surprise, they are mostly american women. Unfortunately american men aren’t much better, so it’s a match made it heaven 🤣
If all their account activity got leaked too they should get sued by the men targeted for defamation
I'm sure everything the women post on there is completely accurate and unbiased and not at all from being butthurt.
lets be honest.  imagine the character of the men who dated these "women."
The app was meant to doxx, criticise and doxx men. If we had an app like that it would have been banned the same day it was published.  Saying shit like "you cannot have fun on the internet" while being the vilest POS and barely a human being, is the biggest cope I have seen in a while. Don't let the irony of undatable women who no one wants to nail calling you incel, escape either.
That lady calling ppl incels has a better chance of getting laid if she put on a Ronald McDonald mask.
If all their account activity got leaked too they should get sued by the men targeted for defamation
The concept of this app is so frightening because what happens is that one dude gets a red flag for a reason that could be justified (or not) but then it doesn't matter because herd mentality will just make these women automatically bombard him with red flags in order to make him a social pariah. Tea app users getting exposed is one thing but I would be happy with this taken down
They Leaked TRUTH,  Women run scared. interesting.
Try looking at reddit comments, they are diabolically ignorant
i started to think 4chan might declassified epstein file before trump lol 😂
Doxers got doxed
they think good and bad is not determined by action, but by identity. In this case if you're a woman or not.  Quite the dangerous position
Rules for thee not for me
doxing people without their consent is "fun" for her?
Doxxing is only OK when we do it 😢
Does the app show how many cats each member has?
Just like they made a blacklist of men, now we make a blacklist of women. The great equalizer has delivered again.
*FOR SUPER EARTH*
"the incels are at it again" she says, while her bangs repel anything remotely human in a 50 mile radius
so they found a hole in the app created by a gay man
The data was available publicly so it wasnt even doxxing
These are the people on reddit that cry misogyny 😂
I keep telling men they should date us passing trans girls. We make better gfs
Rule #7 of the Internet: Anonymous is still able to deliver.
I actually had the idea to develop this but for men. since women cheat 80% more than men, have more wide access to sexual encounters than men. cause more of the divorces than men. But now i look at it the idea itself is great but we have already won really so why bother...
I'm astonished that there is an app that allows people to share other people sensible informations that they deem as bad people. Imagine the uproar if a similar app exists but for men users. Women will go crazy
better believe some of these women will be sued for slander
i wonder how i be looking on my google verification videos now 😂
Women Dox Men and try to shame them and say people shouldn't date them: We're just having Fun don't worry ab out it......  Someone does it to those very same Women:  *Best Greta Thunberg* How DARE YOU!!!
Gat and ugly women will always cause trouble
I don’t trust any woman with bangs.
I can't find the teaspill game anywhere, where is it?
HAHAHAHA 😂
It's okay when they do it ah moment
Should've just named the app Karen
BWA-HAHAHAHAHA!
Time to grab your passports bros!!
Where can you play the game though? The internet censored that shit fucking immediately! Even Reddit bans accounts for sharing a link to it.
how can one be that chopped and then go on to doxx their partner
you also could call it a doxing app
Ohhh the irony
0:09 Welcome to the internet lady. It’s not about keeping women from having fun. The internet is a place for everybody. It’s about keeping dickheads from doing dickhead things. It’s an honorable cause, and you’re just on the wrong end of it.   Also why would you talk about this in “having fun” terms? The app was doing something very dangerous and wrong to begin with.
What a hideous looking group of people.
Did they not think it would happen
"Dildo of consequences comes without security." —Tea
I wonder how that user distribution map would look when superimposed on recent treatments for Bacterial Vaginosis?
I'm very surprised the first one in the vid didn't have one of those booger nose rings to go with that haircut and giant glasses.
0:18 These are the same type of people that nagged payment processors into censoring the things that they didn't like. They absolutely hate it when other people are having fun. 😢😢
1:47 Bruh. This isn't a leak, its a god damn tsunami of a clown show.
4chan did it again. All Hail Yotsuba!
If companies like SONY can't keep your data safe, you're insane if you think any amount of security will keep your data safe. Don't put it up if you don't want it to be public. Even on Facebook, your private gallery can be browsed by a moderator with a funny accent to make sure it's not illegal.

So they need you to give them your government ID to confirm that you are a woman? They say that s*** like you can't put a wig on and put female down and go get a new ID or driver's license😂
Beer app when
What the app actualy did, making a data base of the most ugly woman in America😂
Bangs rarely look good
anthem of super earth playing in the background is the cherry on top
Why would it be okay to spread someone else private information around to begin with? Who thought this app was actually morally fine? Is it because we can automatically assume all the men posted on the app are evil and therefore it's okay? It's the ultimate version of a woman making a false claim and the target is instantly crucified.
Fat Karen App
Howwgg list 😂
Headline: The Chop Cartel takes a major L 🗡️🤮😂
So we lost nothing of value.
Women are the worst
If you aren't good looking, you gotta make it up by having an amazing personality or else you are screwed.
Karen Prime is karening
Sad part is she thinks she's the intelligent one
We created a creepy list and talked shit about people...but we are the victims...no accountability,  double standards, typical for certain folks these days
The only thing harassing those girls is Diabetes
they have all of the hax0r knowledge with their clear hipster glasses
I bet you app was created by women.
The ghosts, ghouls, and goblins have been exposed months before Halloween. Lmfao!
Someone should take all that data, create a new app, name it something like: fugly, undatable, unrootable...
NGL, its kinda scary that they stored all of the ID photos instead of deleting them after verification
Ofcourse who could've guessed it was the "Women who never get any" telling the other few ones on why they should'nt also "get any" with all sorts of agenda filled depressed advice. You could see it coming from a mile away. Good looking women dont have time to get on such apps anyway, atleast I hope not Lmfao.
These bitches are really 5'3 / 200 Ibs talking about 'red flags' in men 😂
I'm honestly surprised that she used the forbidden W word. We're clearly cis-white-chest feeders, obviously
Women and the historical problem of accountability
She's so chopped ofc she's on the tea app no man want her
Sometimes i wonder what type of person my algorithm thinks i am
They made an app for doxxing people and when they got doxxed, they're crying about it? Make that make sense.
🤣🙄🤣
Someone should make website called whale watching with this leaked data 😂
No man is dating those women.
It's the haircut that gave away how she thinks
and then he grabbed me by the neck
Goblins are real
We cant have fun on the internet because of carens like you
Love the Helldiver Bgm o7
They find the guy who did it and Red Flag him
“Women can’t have a nice time on the internet”. The nice time: doxxing and denigrating men…
Just asking ... are we really surprised internet trolls look like trolls?
The fringe 👀👀
"Stay safe"? Yeah stay safe on the internet, idiot. The fact these women are willing to compromise their personal ID to spread potentially damaging information about men they don't like anymore speaks volume
I'm 43 and I have never hated women so much in my life. They are the absolute worst. Damn I miss the 90's.
it's weird I'm 260 ibs don't have a huge belly, or third chin, am  somewhat muscular at 5' 11. how someone can let themselves go where it's just fat is eww. for both genders
How's this app legal?
I'm sorry but if that is really her attitude I think the hackers need to continue. Let's get it in her life deep...... If she really doesn't see what she was doing was toxic, illegal , and highly ill-advised then she needs to learn her lesson More fully
You know they be lying on their drivers license about how heavy they are. You can add 50 pounds.
Can't get over Swe vs Eng. With that said, go lionesses ❤
Man creates an app for women. Women trash men.  Man exposes misandry.   Happy ending.
I bet this app was created by a Male as a bait. Then he provided the Key of the server’s door to the “Hackers”.  Poor women, always getting fooled by men.
Funny how it’s not the good looking ones doing this stuff. 😂
This is just the start of a fucked up era.  It’s essentially a type of social credit score, just not imposed by the state.  A new type of vigilante justice outside of our actual judicial system, which is what is supposed to help protect these women, all joking aside. (and forgetting the fact that protection is likely a small part of what this app is actually used for i.e. gossip)  I do not like what the fuck is going on here.
These bug eyed horror shows have never been with a man. They are hideous incels.
Did she say incell or infidel?  Im definitely the second one, and probably would agree that I would also claim to be whatever that first thing was.  That’s how little I care about what she thinks. I don’t really even care to learn what an incell is, or whatever.   Have a nice life.
Bruh, they made an app for shitlib white women where they can collectively go and be ugly Karen's.
So it's a lesbian dating app?
If it was an app for men to talk shit on women, oh man.
it is always  ''4chan inteligencia''  hahaha, soon there will be 5 minute documentary about this on youtube
Someone spilled the tea!
1:02 HAIL SUPER EARTH! AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Glad this video came out, I had only heard about this “tea” app in passing however I thought it was something men had come up with to watch out for crazy women/ gold diggers etc… It didn’t seem like something men would do but I figured maybe it was a turn of the tides. Makes more sense now that it originated with ugly women and ended up turning on them.
so, fat, ugly women that spend their time circlejerking about guys not choosing them and telling everyone how "they weren't even that good of a catch" is calling other people "incel" which, i have to remember everyone, means "involuntary celibate"  i'm so tired of blind people.
With those bangs on that girl, is 100% a sign of mental health issues.
Genetic sewer calling others "incels." Gotta love the pure comedy gold...
Heavy hitters
The app sounds like a reasonable way for a woman to avoid dangerous men in the dating pool, but it seems unlikely that one’s going go into that app and find the guy that just asked you out.
These are women that always think “the women is always right”
It's always the criminals that say "We can't have fun". 🙄
Repeal the 19th
It didn’t get “leaked”. It goddam split the seams and rivets and welding. Do you know what happens when you try and squeeze a 10 ton tank into a cola can ? 🔥🔥
You love to see it 😂
Did it pay money for THAT haircut?
It used to be the fridge protecting the snacks. 2025 the fridge is protecting itself
The doxxer doesn't wanna be doxxed... imagine
Ah yhea, South Park girl's list episode
Oh how the turns have tabled
always the uglies
Gross.
Nobody cares what that 3 is doing.
Lain Iwakura in Thumbnail
If Chit was a woman.  IYKYK
They tried to be safe by giving their personal government information to a website that can obviously easily get hack. Peek woman logic right there
Why are they all 0.5/10?
As Eminem said "why can't you bitchs be normal"
why do they all look like that? 😳
they have the ability to vote. think about it.
Christ sake...I was eating 😳 🤢
Who told these people that their haircuts look good
“I’M A 5 STAR MAN!”
I'm sure the men have page also
Whoever did that should become the next president.
and of course none of these women did anything wrong right? im all for keeping women safe from the creepy dudes out there, but this app was far from that! this was women doing all the caty talk they do in the restroom and or wherever it is they gather to talk about things like "billy dumped me for a prettier girl.. but he has a small dick anyway" (and cue caty female cackles)! what these women are really mad about is that it exposes that the ones who were talkin shit are 2s and 3s at best and to top it off it looks like some of the women havent seen the inside of a gym in years... let alone what their feet look like! like everyone who has been reporting on this has been saying... if you cant take it, maybe you shouldnt be dishing it out! (or at least something similar to that)
And yet they call themselves Smarter than Men😅
4chan to the rescue lol
I didn't realize stalking people and rating them was just "women having fun". Imagine if dudes did this. The outrage would be nation wide and networks would be calling for justice. People like this pry for information from you and use it for crap like that app and its exactly why when people start asking questions of me in public I tell them to f*ck off. No one needs to know shit about me.
"Equally balanced, as all things should be" - Sonaht
Do you think maybe it was all part of the plan? Like having an app where women have a free outlet to spill at the crap and doxx men; only to be "hacked" and have it turn against them. Like having the a profile picture, with their location and also their weight, it's too good lmao
☕
Is that app even legal? Even if it isn't its just morally wrong, I know they wont see it that way but if instead it was men who made an app rating women and adding photos and red flags to them they themselves would never accept it, not a chance. It would obviously be called sexist... which I actually agree with, but that should swing both ways. A lot of todays problems could be resolved before they've even started by thinking "What would happen if the shoe was on the other foot? Would I like to be treated like this too?"
The hacker known as 4chan attacks again!
OUT FUCKING SMARTED XD
Oh no they can‘t have fun Let men have fun too 😢
A safe space these feminists can use to stalk and bash men.  Any notion of something like this used by men to do the same to women would come under vicious attack.  Women want to be equal but when the shoe is on the other foot...
Now link that to every dating profile they ever create!
POETIC JUSTICE ⚖️ ✨️ ❤️ 🙌
Love it
You can tell by the eyebrows they up to no good
I can't imagine giving some random app my id, besides it's a banking app.
Just imagine if there was an app for men to rate how hot women were and say what town/city/borough they lived in. That would be INSANE. If faces and phone numbers weren't involved and it was just first name, last initial, small description, none of this would be an issue. But you're outing guys for potentially no reason or fake reasons. How would this be okay in any capacity.
Darvo tactic on overdrive
I'm more surprised that they _didn't_ think their little doxxing club was gonna get exposed.  Gotta love 4chan for showing that they still got the magic in them though.
I never ever thought I would say this... 4chan. LMAO!!!
where s the link to the game lol edit. found it lmao
All fat and unattractive. They quick to call men incels. Stay Salty and alone ladies. LMAO
They all look exactly how you thought they looked like…
i would've liked it if it had gone on for a longer time to gain more info on these detestable women. Truly single women material.
Nothing wrong with Doxxing at all.  BTW, this is hilarious.
that's a "problematic" glasses xD
Women: condonin sexist and objectifying operation on a massive scale that put men in danger. It's fine. Men: want a little respect and engagement in their relationship. It's misogyny
This is just too easy. It’s always our fault when it’s theirs.
Those girls date guys?
If there was an app like this but for men, there would be protests on the streets.. Double standards
Where can i find the data? I need to order some pizza you know.
I guess they spilled the tea
There should be a BIG lawsuit, like any man's name on gets a cut.
someone should show this to the uk government lol
The Super Earth anthem works nicely here 😂😂😂
1:41 guss, you needed a man? For your firewall.
All of them have "Resting HR face"
Head on a swivel?  *laughs*  If there is one thing a miserable chick loves to obsess about, it's that someone, a big strong, dangerous man, perhaps?  Like in one of those books they read, maybe even a billionaire werewolf?  Is coming after them, stalking them, hunting them... wanting them...  Don't worry ladies, based on what I'm seeing from this leak, you're safe.
Spill dot Info dot gf ...... for those wondering....
Inb4 we finally get basic privacy provisions with apps now because women most affected
"Expose" as in anyone who got rejected can make shit up because they are salty or just want everyone else single since they are undatable. HAVE YOU SEEN THEIR PICTURES ? lol, combined with the personality that would use such an app, it is as rotten as you can expect.
LMAO the game is peak.  There is a dog on the leaderboard.
This is the best meme this year so far
AI lets people who can't code poorly code apps. They also don't understand how to secure their client's information and don't care.  Be very careful what apps you install going forward.
I saw zero dateable ladies on any of those photos. Perhaps the problem is internal. If you worked on and cared about yourselves maybe others would pay you the attention you so crave. Take a moment to reflect and take accountability.... wait these are women on the internet. Nevermind.
😂😂 fun?... loosers
"We were just having fun!" - People who if the the genders were reversed would have lost their shit.
I bet you won't find one objectively attractive woman using that trash... they are busy living their best lives.
Accountability and responsibility lmfao its for whamen only and you expect that...
No place in the world anymore for these types
I don't know what the girl is talking about, she was having a lot of fun with TEA and now we are having a lot of fun with TEA. Everybody gets to have fun with 'the internet'.
Makes you think about how much data these apps store.
Can we please repeal the 19th. Women having rights was a mistake and this Tea App proves it.
Militant fem nazis/karens cataloguing people who don't want to be part of the cult. Logical progression...didn't see that coming through
3W spill info gf Add dot between each and have fun ;)
All these women need is being "Grabbed By The Pussy"   -  President Donald Trump
I sleep well at night knowing that these are the women that call me incells on the internet
You can get away with bullying if you're really high status. These women unfortunately misjudged their status.
A leak of ugly nobodies... This is a reverse of the Fappening.
Well now we don't need to ask their weight
And now the uk wants to make it type of verification mandatory 🤡
Accountability and Women: A Venn Diagram of Non-Converging Circles
If you're dumb enough to trust an app like that with your govt issued ID, you deserve everything coming your way
Women "cant have fun on the internet" - meanwhile women are making thousands and millions dollars off of internet streaming services and onlyfans,  getting all the attention they could ever want, without having to ever see a real human being in person.
The femcells are acting up again.
Women attack primarily through reputation destruction but the ones who weaponize it too freely and easily destroy their own reputation.  Case closed here.
F-ing people.
HOGS MAD 😆
Look at all those Democrats.
To be honest, these ladies should just enjoy the dating experience while it lasts and just do normal diligence so as not to be scammed.
The way the site was set up almost seems like a challenge to 4chan and other sexless rage lords, who are arguably the worst kinda of people to throw down a gauntlet and challenge to.
Wtf are those supervillain glasses on that starbucks cashier
Isn't creating a huge dossier of people, names and all without consent HIGLY illegal?
Where can I play the tea spill?
Looks like scammerpayback and a few other scam fighting youtubers are gonna have their work cut out for them.
imagine if a man making a woman version of Tea App
Some would consider this " Divine Intervention".
I call shenanigans. No freaking way these "women".... ahem... got a date with some of the guys they claim they did. Where are the pics of the soy boys they actually got hooked up with?   SHENANIGANS  😐
Well I guess some people are gonna face some consequences for their actions Hahahaha!!!
Know the best part? This proves that companies are not safe having sensitive data like real life images, IDs, or our locations. On the topic of posting "red flags," this should be the biggest red flag to anyone who's trying to demand companies get IDs from people.
1:03 is that the super earth anthem?
If these people put all their time and energy in working out, eating healthy and care about their own shit they would have a great life. Instead, they are cry-bullies who will die alone or with a bunch of cats. Pathetic
Even all their id's
How does this work for them with their whole a women is some who identifies as a women? guess they dropped that LGBT bullshit now?
no wonder why our governemtn is so prone to security breeches from international entities.  dumb karens not knowing what spyware is, might be the downfall of our country.
"PIG LIST"
Worse?  It keeps getting better and better.
W 4Chan Can't wait to see this on the Internet Historian's channel 😂
Incels had nothing to do with it.  It was all about TERRIBLE IT DECISIONS!
"So sombody nasty was able to access these images and leak them" oh... so you mean like the same way yall were doing on the app?
This happened because 4chan is full of people who take out their bad impulses on 4chan.  The Tea app is full of people who take out their bad impulses on irl people.
That haircut and eyeglasses are definite RED FLAGS
Doxing for me but not for thee.
how surprising they are all as ugly as the night
Doxers got doxed. Fair game
Those who don't pay taxes and don't work should be deprived of their right to vote. Those who only want the government to give them money. Isn't that the Democratic Party's policy?
Tea with Karen.  It's like the Borg
Super earth anthem in the background got me
Doubt there are enough cats in the world for all these,soon to be middle-aged, harridans...
"in order to prevent men, they implemented a strict verification measures....  Anyways 4chan got access"
Everything bad people like this do is always fine in their own mind, because their moral compass is "I feel like it".
Finally, I found her home address!!!!!!
Why is the Super Earth Anthem playing on the game
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. The hypocrisy is through the roof. Women stalking men is ok, but men exposing women stalking men is nasty. Ok, sis.
Its always women no one would fuck
Nice ❤
That fringe (US Bang) is criminal 😂
Everyone using this app was "somebody nasty"
In german it's called "Problem Pony". It always gives away the mindset.
The user base looks exactly how you would expect them to.
"Somebody nasty was able to access this info"  Not somebody nasty, somebody determined.
These are the women who are chasing the top 20% of men and don't want anything below that by the way 😂😂😂😂
This reminds me of these videos where Indians scam callers get scammed. Brings tears to my eyes
This reminds me of somthing that 4chan would pull off during its golden age. Glad 4chan had one more in them.
I beg to differ. Its actually getting better.
As a web and mobile app developer, I am appalled. We do not store location data for users on apps unless completely necessary. This use case was not necessary at all.
Oh, no. How awful for them. Anyway . . .
make the same for us men and see how big the outcry is
ofc its a app for fat chicks to feel better. what goes arround comes arround.
Gee I cant imagine why all these. . .unique?. . .looking women would have had any bad dates with men that they'd want to post on that app to begin with.
Doesn’t want you to have fun 😂😂 or sex
300 wahmen vs accountability
get rid of women's rights
That's a lot of meta Kaceytrons and Frogans.😊
Women have is so hard.  Especially white American women.  They must have it harder than any human beings had it ever in history.  It's amazing how hard white women in America have it.
Imagine if such app was for men... It would probably have been removed from app store by google on day 1.
Ah yeah the classic unhinged bowl cut fringe + semi normal woman hair at the back. She's a keeper guys!
What scares me more than their lack of accountability, is the fact they're legally allowed to vote...
they should make a average weight metric for these leaks, would be interesting/funny to see
That app should’ve never been greenlit if it allows users to expose THAT level of info. I work for a data management company and if we were exposing people’s info like that, we would get sued into the ground. What these women were doing should be considered criminal.
So we can't have hot girls in video games to have fun, but they can do whatever they want. Got it.
Weaponized autism strikes again.
Hypocrisy and lefty lawnmower haircuts really come in pairs
... .--. .. .-.. .-.. .-.-.- .. -. ..-. --- .-.-.- --. ..-.
The real story here is just showing how bad of an idea online id is.   Now remember they want your id for social media and porn....
Im sure it was leaked by a man...😂😂😂😂
interesting detail noticed by europeans...... you Americans have your weight (?) printed on your legal documents?
Go read first letter America Made Everything  On  Near  Terrifying Walmart Ireland Tacky Taffy Ellen Ronaldo  Lizard Irish Never Known
I feel like this app was a sting operation and I salute to anyone who made it.
I mean.... you gotta admire the amount of bullshit in that app, cause you know none of those fuglies got a single date in the last 15 years... so all their "information" was just bullshit.
This tea app sounds awfully close to that one South Park episode where the Dutch would expose the Internet histories of everyone on the planet to "catch trolls"
Looks like the tea got spilt...
Why do they look exactly like we thought they would?
So according to her doxxing humans is fun? WOW
American ID's show a lot of details. Just looking at my Aussie ID, it doesn't have a single physical description besides the photo, doesn't even say gender.
The amount of neck on these creature to discuss avoiding certain men is off the charts, 99% of these creatures will never reproduce. Swamp monsters
The only thing that app proved is women are sharing the same men
its the refrigerators they created a hub to gather round and live in misery together
They all look the same, it's creepy AF.
I've always spoke about the phantom danger of female sociopathy. It's extremely prevalent and the sad reality many women are prone to this. The unfortunate nature is found in what is inherently the mothers of society. The very things they are they, they produce as their children. The very men they hate. Their own creations. Many women like them are a copy of of the parent. Many problems in life are because of females lack of accountability and emotional reaction. It's rotting from the inside.
i wait for plot twist that says app wasnt hacked at all and in reality it was set up by man to save man from toxic red flag "feminists" like those
The doxxers become the doxxed. I love poetic justice.
The average user checks out
this is like 9/11 for ugly women
Tea probably employed a very modern, diverse multi-gendered IT security specialist team...that some 9-year-old gamers from 4chan could "crack" their database.  "Yeah, sure, they probably are not that dumb to use 1234 as a password, or are they?" "Gotcha!"
How to tell your app wasn't programmed by a dude.
What tf is that hairline😂😂😂
Moral of the story: Don't do immoral, illegal actions, because they can come back to haunt you.
Ahh yes... the super earth anthem in the background. Exactly how it should be.
1:48 forward. Chopped male epidemic. Am i right, ladies? Eve the US government workers looks exactly like one of these cute little ladies 😂
I actually love this, what a time to be alive
Perhaps for the first time in the history of our species emotional maturity has become a requirement on women. Of course that is always going to be a challenge to young people, men and women alike, but holy shit this takes the cake I think. The women who were active on this app must have profound issues with self awareness.
This is kinda the predictable yet perfect outcome.
Imagine being so stupid that you think anything online is secure.
every sexoffender get notifications now for tea😂
The idea for fun for these women is to gossip and catalogue men in an app? Just play fucking video games
“A fun time on the internet” A fun time? I thought it was for the safety & protection of women from possible axe murderers… The mask slips again 😂
0:31 Is it legal in the US for any app to require such personal data?
holy shit how was this app even legal?  its very easily a defamation lawsuit.  any claims to stories or someone being undateable and then exposing their personal information on the app with a story that cant be verified (the entire apps purpose it seems).. so anyone can make up a story or flag someone as "red flag" to not date.  i think the fact it backfired on its own users is enough justice but now thats its gained publicity a real developer will see theres a market for femcels and try to make their own version now.
Its so funny to see Women trying to somehow compete with Men when every one with more then 2 brain cells knows this entire world is build and maintain by men and if by some abstract hypothetical scenario there will be a gender war everybody knows what side will win and its not even in the same universe of a power scale. This is ridiculous and this people ridiculous.
They say mans are monsters. Look now who are the real monsters.
They all looks like they hate men having fun time at BBQ... They looks like type of women that yell at happily married mother of 3 that decided to stay home and rise her kids calling her brainwashed and oppressed...They looks like fear and dread of every manager in 90km radius...They looks like type of people that barge in on private conversation just to throw in most brain dead opinion...
0:03 That's her too😂😂
When you FAFO too close to the sun ... 🤣
Those are the ugly fat women who stop their hot female friends from talking to you because of jealousy "she doesn't want your drink"
There's always the ones with the pig ring but then there's the one's with the pig ring taking up their whole nostrils that are even dumber.  Seems to be due to them suffering from lack of Oxygen and being actual mouth breathers. Ironic.
0:08 The image of the enemy is the most important. For communists it is the bourgeoisie, and for insecure women it is the incels.
so, the doxxers got doxxed? FAFO
ahh Mericans and their funny apps
Yep i f#%÷ing knew it bro 😂
Isn't it illegal for a business to discriminate against gender?
Time to make an app called "Tea Revolt App" to reference the Americans revolting against the British because of the high tea tax
Repeal the 19th
Remember:  When they do it, it's empowering and should be celebrated. But when someone does it to them, it's sexist and should be punished with imprisonment.
Karma
Having fun on the internet? So as a "woman" for you to have fun you must degrade and belittle men with other women? Your disgusting.
In their world, accountability for your own actions are called "discrimination and sexism". Classic
We need app for men. Bonnie Blue will on top of the list.
How do you look like the first girl and call people incels. Oversized glasses, unwashed greasy hair, brown.
This whole thing is the most ironic thing I've heard in years 😂
Those bangs 😂😂😂
its ALWAYS the ones who are SO ugly, theyre doomed to life of cats :L
I saw someone else make an excellent point: A dating app requires a license, but not voting?!?!
Uncanny how they all look identical.
That shirt with the green square makes her look like she on the job at Starbucks.
Notice how unfuckable those women are
The last woman.. "Eyes: HAZ"..... she definitely haz eyes wow look at those meat marbles
The app didn't require you to post your ID specifically, just a photo was enough, however what do you expect from women-only gossip app It also said "it doesn't store your personal data after verification" (that's a lie) It also didn't remove metadata from the photos. Also, if you put your ssn/id/drivers license in front of your house visible for anyone who walks by, that's not "hacking", that's you being dumb.
Yep 4chan always delivers the goodies!
You have your weight on your Ids in the US?
There was no hack, no-one "gained access" to the database. It was all stored on a public cloud, not even encrypted.
And UK thinks is good to have that verification bullshit
When women forget most of IT is made of males....
were just trying to have fun and privately doxx and lie about people then some mean people had to ruin it booo fucking hoo
Lol! It's so true. Those glasses and that fringe mean no fun allowed. An unmarried Karen
0:18 Super Earth Salute!
Nice haircut in the beginning.
You know, when she can act passive-aggressive like that, it’s a sign of not being oppressed.  It may in fact indicate privilege.
Come on Asmon, i'm eating WTF
Seems like mostly ugly women trying to harm men that rejected them. Next someone should cross reference those women with dating apps and see how many have misleading information and pictures in order to catfish men.
Did every lady in this video lose a bet!?
As the Hulksters would say hell yeah brother.
I find it funny that NOW people ask if this is legal. I mean, the entire app turns women into American version of Gestapo/Stasi and NO ONE asked beforehand if this is permitted.
hilarious
None of these women are attractive...
Ho3s mad.
It was at this moment she realised she Fd up
The Doxers got Doxed!   Love it…
The only thing beautiful in this story is the justice.
It’s astonishing this was even allowed in the firsts place. Nothing was verified, nothing was fact checked. Anyone could say anything about anyone.
I bet alot of this women are now suing that company.
Masses need physical Genetic profile snips + Genetic behavior snips from ancient civilization builders. Too many "Genotoxic" chemicals in tap water and foods. *Squints at hundreds of millions of Christians and slides eyes to fall of Rome by poisoning* Since none of that power by volume to stop it, logical deduction of anyone with a mind is that you're all accepting it. Fun Fact: Church doesn't believe in science to fix GMO's. When they win they'll go for the kids of it while trying to disarm you or draft you. Just like the Church did in Nazi Germany. "Hitler Youth" < That was the Soldiers babies that were sent to fight the world. Simpletons.. (Not saying the church is wrong for how they mop up the trash DNA just saying they're guilty for ordering the toxins to make it required with no science option because masses too stupid religious nobody wants to rule that weak filth its insulting.) - Dracula
So the sea donkeys are mad because the game is over. What else is new for them.
Lol literally they recreated the social network scene
It's the Council of Karens.
> "Fun on the Internet" > Looks inside > Ethically unjustifiable objectification of men through subjective rating systems and non-consensual collections of images of them, with unregulated comments about them throughout.  > "Especially if youre a woman" > Looks inside again > "I'm a victim of discrimination (self-alleged) and therefore hold no reasonable accountability for my actions (self-claimed) because I am but a sorry little victim of society (self-reported)"
/pol/ on 4chan is a wild ride rn xD
Oh hey, I was in that 4chan thread. Fun times. Some moron tried to livestream it, so some people started posting gore.   Never forget, the ancient Greeks wrote a play about women gaining absolute power in Athens and using it to create a proto-communist big sister state with rules like "good looking men have to fuck all the ugly girls first before they can be with a pretty woman." It was a comedy.
Sucks to suck don't be shitty people and shitty things are less likely to happen to you
whoever goes on an app like Tea might want to get a life
"its not all women" yeah 90% is still not all women duh. avoid women at all cost.
Bunch of people who can stand under a table but not lie down😂
Gross….
you guys have weight in ID? xD
These people are the definition of " The pot calling the kettle black "
all these super mega fuglies claim they go on dates , but id laugh if there was a corresponding site where dudes complain of being stood up because you know these sheilas were catfishing
Every last one of those females is an incel; no man wants any of them. Pot calling kettle black. 🤦‍♂️
😂 i bet the app maker left the back door open on purpose after seeing how women ruin the intention of the app. App maker is a man who made the app after his mom had bad online dating experiences with cat fish
These women are the ones who no one in their right mind would want.
"No one can have a fun time on the internet" Wrong. Now both sides can have fun on the internet.
puros orcos de Mordor , y locas del coño con cortes de pelo femcels , les falta solo el pañuelo cartoon network
I don’t actually see the issue here like, if I could get an app to watch on women I will probably do it, not for expose but for pragmático y know more, so I actually think is great because many bad men out there and for the information I got this app just give a good search and that’s it like no bank account information so, what’s actually the deal here?
Bro the fuck is that fringe
It's amazing how every single all of them look exactly how you would expect them too look like.
Single women keep women single
Slander app, nice
Ooof that chilli bowl hair cut
This is what victim mentality does to people.
The Super Earth anthem makes it perfect
"I'm a Prize!" - Fat hog on Tea Dating Advice
This isn’t satire but somehow it’s fucking hilarious 🤣
It was an app for women to gossip and treat life like highschool
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
which is more dangerous to be leaked by the app or to get Obesity?
AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Maybe stop being a man-hating c*nt and bad things won't happen?
Will they ever learn accountability?
"Ahh yess". The app of the rejected one's
And what a wonder! They all look like Gollums.
Lol, at this point the word incel is synonymous for normal person
What did they expect
I bet you it’s just all the bad ones on this app and happy women are to busy taking care of their kid while their husbands are working
To quote a great meme guy : why do poly people always look like that?
This feels like Tumblr vs. 4chan wars all over again seeing all those "colorful personas" reacting to it, but this time they all can only blame themselves and the app. Hope that when Beer app gets made, it's not programmed by a toddler and guys there will just be chill instead of doxing.
Bruh….the comments in the chat! 😂😂😂
spill info gf
They look like you expect....... And then act like you would expect
Those bangs are:
this is all cause boys created FB to rate females hot or not xD boys and their toys comon honey chill we know you like to gossip with your girl friends ^^
If only they’d employed male IT staff they’d probably have been fine. They probably used DEI procedures to find staff, and paid the penalty.
The app was a vector for evil women to make defamatory comments of men, it says a lot about how satanic these women are that they consider breaking the law and making defamatory claims "fun".  The west is headed toward a left vs right war.
Sooo "my past don't define me" but women also: "we need to write down everything about other people past"?
"No one can have a fun time on the internet, especially women" Damn, didn't know being part of a stalking ring targeting guys who did nothing to you was so entertaining. I'd say you must be fun at parties but I dont think you get invited to any.
Trust me bitch. No red blooded male wants to Know who you are let alone WHERE you are.
I want to know if I was being talked about or someone was doxing me on the app.
so women cant have fun if they don't dox men on the internet?
Funny how all the women that use this look like they hit the wall 10 years ago and now are stuck in 304 Limbo 😂😂
Don't you love the dual standard?
Even the top 50 on the ranking page are not particularly pretty...
That DOD person is a moron. We're specifically told to not submit photos of those IDs for any sort of verification outside of government use.  Also just more proof that companies can't be trusted with this id verification shit that they're trying to push on places like porn sites.
Her video translation: it's funny when we do it but waaaaa you did it.
So they created an antifa dating app basically. Looking at those pics it feel like you are scrolling through some criminal database.
That's the equivalent of the boys gc getting leaked. Women were furious because boys were boys when with boys. They didn't want safe space for men. Well btches, time to pay back, no safe space for you either wh0res. Let's show the entire world those fckng fat asses of yours complaining about not getting railed.
women most affected once again
i wonder. for how long do they think we LET them do this kind of shit. All they have to remember is wait a minute MEN LET us do all this shit  if they wanted to we would be chained to the kitchen/bedroom  and striped of every right....... WOMAN i once loved you creatures
Was it for fun or for safety?
what if its the other way around?
Reddit thinks these women are Christians 😂😂😂
I can't imagine why this became the target of hackers. 🤣🤣🤣
"Holy brother" is hilarious. 😂😂😂
"You can't have fun as a woman" - Yeah, having fun ruining lifes of lonely guys making them more fucking lonely, good job super shit
4chan the legendary heroes.
Keep in mind US consider a literal Doxxer lair app legit when EU don't.   Tell you a lot of why US is seen as morons by the rest of the world
Funny how they're complaining about noone can have fun on the internet yet it's the same people trying to sensor everything you can say on and off-line
"head on a swivel ladies" yeah right, the metoo bullshit made it clear that it is in fact men that needs to have their heads on a swivel to not have their lives ruined by a false accusation. Women would not need to have their heads on a swivel if they did not do shit like this or voted for mass immigration...
why is this app still up ?
Didn't even show the ugliest ones.
their weights got leaked???  haha funny shit.
if only 4chan hack and release the Epstein list now...
Bruh, if men did this women would FLIP THE FCK OUT.
Never heard of this app. So any crazy woman that may not like a guy trying to go out with her can put his info on it? Is this what we have come to?
Classic Teabagers
Play stupid games, get stupid prizes.
How can literally anyone feel sorry for these women? You join a group solely dedicated to doxing people and get upset when you yourself are doxed? Make it make sense.
Half the ladies in the leak were 3s and 4s, then some 5s and very rarely any 6s but the men they were asking questions about? All 8s or 9s and straight up 10s.
Funny how women saying they "can't have something nice" had to be something all about men. Can't they think of anything else that would fun besides bashing men?
for Super Earth?
4chans intelligentsia 😂  Sounds fuckin funny, but.. I see the truth. Those mo fo are not stupid or without means..
"Femcels knew that they could not change society. So instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the men."
that fringe at the start of the video is known as "the cunt".
you gave your goverment ID and geo location to make a LIST about hate. well you made a LIST alright and all they did was RELEASE THE FILES.
Why they always look the same and have the same vibe
You have got to be so stupid to give ANY social media app ID, Personal information etc about yourself. I guess youth of  today have NO idea what privacy is and understand what it means. NEVER give corporate companies or any company information..
4chan was behind a flag steal on a picture.   Tea was nothing positive, so the fact they got a counter dox and cry they did the same is ironic.   Doxxing is illegal by law and boy, they are only in the beginning of their own hell...
Are these female incels?  Are they even female?
Why do they genuinely ALWAYS look like that ?
1:50 Wait, do they weigh you for the ID in USA? Woah. I mean, why? Weight can change drastically so that information being stamped on the ID is kinda useless in the long term.
I gotta say, 4chan is the most free social website and it saved us.  Props to those autistic garage hacking enjoyers.
What if it was a 4chan user that created the entire app just for this purpose 😂
Problem glasses.
Ashley Maddison also had a leak didn't it? How come these women don't understand that they will always be caught eventually when doing bad things?
Dude get a girlfriend dam who gives a f...
lol it was horrible when guys had a app like that now they complain they got leaked XD
We PWNed the other team
Hahaha, suffer in yer undies, billy sitches!
It's the hogs! It's always the hogs!
We need statues of 4chans heroes not DEI statues
Let's leak others' info but not ours.
As per usual, they love dishing it out, but can't take the heat back
it's only a problem when it started happening to them. they were all for it when they werent the ones being doxxed. funny how that works.
I think this app only exists so that unattractive, mean-spirited women can gossip together. We live in truly sad times, sad and if you look at these women, truly pathetic.
1:00 Is that the fucking Super Earth anthem
You can never tell me that somebody w those glasses and this weird ahh half bowl cut finds any use at all with the Tea app … ain‘t nobody out there touching that
Always the victims…
4chan undefeated
Epstein Files NOW, This hack just another distraction.
4chan for president. They know how to puplish things.
I like how they require sensitive information with no security and woman just buy into it because they want to be bitches. the irony is amazing.
🎵 Everything that goes around, comes around.🎶
Except Wendy Peffercorn
The majority of problems come from 2 groups of people. This is a combination of both groups.
For some reason the person who use it is exactly the kind of unhinged people who think they're hotter than they actually are..
Great 80´s movie The Untouchables...oh wait...
Septum theory has never had so many champions
0:08 you call doxing, slander and being unkind a "fun time on the internet."  So you reap what you sow, and I'm laughing.
They're so sexist they didn't even think for a second that it was possible for the hackers to be female...and some of these dumbasses work with female programmers and IT security professionals.
They look exactly as you would expect them to. And they're the ones calling other people incels.
1:42 somebody nasty she says. You mean like all those women who downloaded the app.
I think this is hilarious. They don't even have the moral high ground on anything. I can at least say that I never doxed anyone. They cant XD
Ugly women with bad genes are throwing a temper tantrums. How is this even trending or newsworthy?
Rule 35 of the internet should be "Never get 4-chan involved"  4-chan is basically where people who thread the deep web come up for air. They'll throw piss on anything on the surface for fun
Shoe on head is going to have a field day with this
I love how the app that could just let you blatantly dox men was free to exist for months (years? I heard about this bs, I just can't remember how long it was going on) But the minute someone made a game to rate the pictures of the doxxer's it immediately gets ripped off of the internet 🤣 You can't get more sexist than this.
It's the whole HR department 😂😂😂
All Hail the Mighty 4chan Group.
Bro , anyone who has their hair cut like that should be avoided
Lmao cant write this shit.
HAHAHAHA you get what you deserve Woketurds
"They don't want us to have fun."  Read as: "They don't want us to get petty revenge by lying about men that rejected us and/or hurt our ego's."
"No one can have fun  " are you kidding me ? This is the funniest thing thats happen so far in this millenia.  Perfect irony.  On so many levels. God has an amazing   sense of humour 😅.
Smart idea, great, the best concept since feminazism stomped on chivalry, let's go & make fun of total strangers on the internet, surely nothing has ever been leaked on the internet before... A catchy theme song comes to mind; Welcome to the Internet by Bo Burnham. ('anything that brain of yours can think of can be found')   Lets 'anonymously' humiliate dox & otherwise humiliate and/or shame people while hiding behind the supposed veil of 'anonymity' on what is essentially a public platform 'run & maintained' by said 'incels' you're having a field day shaming.  Perfect plan... juuuuust one small problem, the platform requires you to register almost all (if not all) of YOUR own personal information before you can even access & judge random strangers for your own pleasure & selfish gratification...  EDIT; I smell a trend, those yee yee haircuts combined with the nose / septum rings in all the wrong places on these heehaw gun-ho judgemental whamen are quite prominent & consistent. Thank you for the tip, I shall NHAT be approaching any of these weird looking haircuts with odd piercing across their faces at all & if I do it will be in complete OSHA gear & a 10meter pole. Another ick to add to the newly formed man-ick list.... yee yee haircut with nose / septum rings in all the wrong places is a definite; Danger Danger ~ in a Steve Irwin voice.  FUN TIMES... Welcome to the internet.
The hair cuts🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lmao! Ha haaaa😂
i think they are still safe. Their coordinates are leaked? yeah like anyone is going after them
someone call green peace.... we got a whole lot of beached whales here...
Cybercriminals will have a field day with all this data
That's not a dude?  Shew wee
Obese Karen's who are not pleasant to look at are the haters litterally feminist incels
ACCOUNTABILITY: The Game
how do you even end up with that hair? it doesn’t even look physically possible
Ogres always have low stealth stats
Don't they realise they are incels? On an app to rage about not being able to get a relationship going.
ow they got burnt after spilling their cup of tea
A business or app banning an entire sex from usage or access is illegal in the U.S. That's a major lawsuit I'm surprised never occured before hand. Maybe one will happen now.
i have 1.80m and kinda chonky and somehow they weight more than me damn
They all have the same glasses
"We can't even have a fun time because we are women" ❌❌ "We can't even dox innocent men without being doxed ourself " ✅✅
Maybe femcels are real after all…
btw 4cuck janitors deleted the original thread cus there all 'cordtroons, snarky snappy won btw
Wish this came out in Europe and it woukd be sued to kingdom come
You were cataloguing and doxxing people. You're a bunch of creepy karens
4chan now has years worth of trolling material. Dont mess with Sayan Autists....
We all knew.
That's an ugly haircut.
What if, The app was a psyopp and intentionally set to get these women? like imagine some ass hole made the app, got women registered that would talk shit about men, and then got ¨¨hacked¨¨ to reveal all the info XD
I saw this ticking time bomb on this data harvesting gossip app coming a mile away. Not like they had police records or court documents as proof to defame a man anyway.
Aw cmon guys. They stopped oil. These protests truly made a difference.....🤣🤣🤣🤣
stop using our hymn , I have to stand up everytime and honor it
These cows have no room to judge anyone. They need to hit the gym for the sake of their own health. I can see why they are so angry, no SELFRESPECTING man would touch them with a 10 foot pole, let alone a 4-9 inch pole.
So, did they have to prove somehow that the men they were blasting were actually creeps? Or could anyone just post anything about a dude?
Leaking your personal info for me, not for thee
Looks like a lotta tubby skanks just trashing dudes who would never date them anyway.
Why they all look like that 😂
4Chan Cyber Division, their motto is " Under budget and ahead of schedule " LFG Anons
"we can't have fun on the internet, especially if you are a woman"  woman on the internet :  - you know what's fun ? - what ? - creating a social credit score for men, keeping tabs on them and give women the opportunity to shit on men regardless of thruth - oh wow that's so fun - *Laughs in Chinese regime*
remember  the usefulness of this data isn't simpy to laugh at the unattractive ones, it's to look at the attractive ones and find patterns  so that you'll be able to detect women like that in real life.
She's not wearing glasses its a flaming entire car windscreen,
Oh man, talk about chopped woman epidemic
kind reminder that these people can vote
i hope next app get a bank account info, then we make it real evolution
Wait,  murica has weight on IDs? That's genius,  in Europe we track height on ID.
Tea where fat bitches complain but never spill bc they would never waste any drink.
Women's "fun" was doxxing men and making fun of them yet when the same exact thing happens to those same exact women now it's they don't want us to have fun, how dare they
The irony of those women using the term "incel". I'm betting they all have dogs and several jars of peanut butter in their nightstand.
Was it a do your own haircut app?
Rules for thee, but not for me I swear these people have no standards unless it is a double standard.
Lmaooo. Women can’t do something right, it’s a man’s fault. Absolute weak gender.
Dude i have a better hair style then them and Im a dude that legit gets only 1 hair cut a year.
1:37  Oh wait  Those things are upset now because their personal information is out there  On an app that they wanted to use to publicly humiliate men for dating women   So now it’s not ok  Phucken hypocrites
One of the people in the photos under conivction is simon leviev the tinder swindler- he enjoys suing and being sued
Tea?  Should've been called Ton...
I don't no why but i feel like that woman should have a nose ring for some reason
It's literally less than they did and they're mad about it lmao.
“We just wanted a safe space 🥺” -Doxxers
The best part? The information wasn't encrypted in any way shape or form. In fact, the information wasn't even hidden. The people who went looking for it didn't find an open back door, they found an open tent with no anchors on the legs.
WAS THAT THE SUPER EARTH ANTHEM?!?!
Shoulda called it the 'Karen' app
Orcs from the misty mountains.
They found a flag in the middle of a field in the middle of nowhere and your surprised they got the info? Hell from what i'v gathered there wasn't even a hack just poor programming n security on the app side of things.
WW3: Men vs Women
Girl, you'll never be safe with bangs like that, holy fk.
Well they did it to themself by being bitches  You also wounder why guys don't want to date you womens, well when you do shit like this then ofcurse no guys want to risk there lifes for some idiots spreading lies (maybe some is true but let's face it most is just lies)
Looking at those pictures makes me WANT to become an incel
War between Incels and Femcels to see who’s the most celibate involuntarily or voluntarily?.. idk…
What we really learned is that these land whales were lying about their weight on government ID.
Cannot find the site unfortunately.
Stalking and posting sensitive information about men on the app: 😍 Posting information of women who used the app: 🤬 Logic.
How do we play the game? xD
How they all make a duckface to appear thinner on their selfies xD
Are we sure that wasn't an app for some underfunded Open Range Zoo?
To be fair, this app just seemed to be sub 5s being bitter about chad pumping and dumping them. I actually feel kind of bad for them.
ok puking in my mouth at every thing past 1:45  and I am 58 which would make you think that I am desperate.. no 5'7" 6 figures and a wife and 4 kids....  somethings are just disgusting
Her teacup is overflowing with tears
So "anonymous" doxxers got doxxed. This is cosmic levels of irony.
that fucking haircut alone tells me the cunt doesnt know what fun is you know whats fun? not bitching on the web lmao but, lemme contradict myself rq
Revolting
if there is one thing i love about women is that they will NEVER understand that action have consequences. cause most of the time they are protected by them. either by law or by some idiot. but this time i'm enjoying my tea with much gusto.
LOL
0:12 she is wearing two glasses. WTF about this woman crap? I am a woman and that Tea App was a terrible app… it was begging to be hacked by men or sjw.  If you don’t want to be rated by men, why stoop down to that level, and rate men? Women have always been better than that… well.. we used too. 😂
based 4chan.
This will only end once physical repercussions start happening
Can we do an app to evaluate women too , I think it would be great since so many are walking lying red flags and also , why not ? I’m not misogynistic, just want to fell safe.
Fatty
By the look of those photos, I'd say they're safe - if anything, people will use that information to tell us where *not* to go
So, if people wanted to they could defame me on this app, and deny any attempt I have to clear up any defamation simply because of my gender? That sounds like a big lawsuit in the making for any men defamed on that app. Also with each picture it showed I could hear the vine boom sound even though it wasn't there.
Strange how they look like lesbians. I suppose if they try to make men seem like bad people they will have more women to date 😂😂
lol US id have weight and height?
Another proof that Human Resources and it's consequences have been a disaster for the human race. I'm betting at least 40% of these escaped zoo animals are working in HR
My parents lied when they told me monsters were not real.
I can hear it the background... managed democracy spreading ❤
I wonder why this sounds familiar 😅
4chan cooked them 🔥
I hear and recognize SUPER EARTH amthem on the background 💪
Dunno if this is even the place to be asking, but where do you find the leaks? I'm morbidly curious if anyone I speak to used it, I'd like to never interact with them again if so.
Women not taking accountability? WHAT?!?!?!
So the people who choose the bear voluntarily put themselves in danger, what a shocker
Why bully ppl tho I domt see the issue with woman wanting a spot to themselves it's not hurting any1 an ya alot of men do need to be reported to other woman cause there violent cheat an other dumb sht but if ur good guy u got nothing worry about
Leave a Snickers for the beast
Dudes wouldn't make a Tea App.  They'd make a "Hit that or quit that" app and it would point out easy marks and psychos in the female dating pool.
Bunch of Femcel😂
Having fun on the internet = bullying and endangering male lives Right Got it
ahahahahahahhhhhahaaaahaha
Very good use of the Helldivers 2 music !
The social tolerence of people who act like these women is running out.
❤️Doxx the Doxxer❤️
the weak should fear the strong. That is the order of things.
If life has taught me anything it's dont poop outdoors in Florida and dont upset 4chan
Let's not forget that the site was extremely unsafe. It was stored onto an unencrypted file database. It was begging to be hacked anyway.
Nice haircut
Those glasses and those bangs means you can’t be around them without getting a lecture.
They still missing the irony huh
I like!!! cookies and cookies and more cookies
Fuglyville
As usual, the dildo of consequence didn't come lubed at all.
The App is gossip on a complete new level
The whole leaked document should be called AET
all the same ugly hair and nosering. But then if they were attractive, they wouldnt be on the app
" MAN IM HAVING FUN EXPOSING THESE GUYS" "WAIT YOU CANT EXPOSE ME!"
They can only throw shade in the physical world. Which they seem to be doing extremely well ;)
Thumbnail:  👁️🎧        👃👁️       👄
Problem glasses.  Bull ring.
She reminds me of a horse looking through a hedge.
Pretty wild how "having fun" for them is synonymous with bullying men online and ruining their reputation. Yeah, no fun allowed in that case, go back under your bridge !
Wait, wasn't that illegal in the first place? Plus they had virtually no security at all, meaning many people may have accessed the database prior to the hacker known as 4chan.
to be 5 ft 5`` and have a weight of 200 lb is an achievement in itself. Must been hard work with multiple visits to the burgershot, donutshop and liquorstore.
Most of them look the same bruh
Do i hear helldivers 2 music in the background?
app to doxxing someone, what you expect?, someone come to your home and give you trophy of "Best App of The Year"? edit : they also somehow has balls to challenge 4chan, what a bunch of fools
I hope Asian scammers have the data and do the right thing.
It was created with good intentions and i feel for the few women that were on there using it as intended instead of being malicious like the majority
Finally a story of justice
It's almost like giving random people on the internet your government issued ID is a bad idea. *Cough UK*
its the glasses you were worried about??? she look like a lego
Just mad cause they got played lmao
I find this funny NGL
The thing that made this app so much worse. It is that the people using it are clearly the type of people to always reconstruct and misrepresent a situation to make themselves look like a victim. Most of the stuff on this app is guaranteed to be lies and exaggeration.
spill dot info dot gf
hahahahahaha
Nothing but Kat Ladies.
Lmao, Goddam Chan you have zero chill
Any links on the Tea Spill game?
"No one can have a fun time on the internet" A fun time?! Even now, men are having to justify their hobbies. A group of women decided to hand over absurd power to payment processors to start the slippery slope of censorship that they themselves dont have control of. Men almost never have a problem with womens hobbies. The one time we do it's when it's a massive privacy and defamation concern.
1:37 "somebody nasty" flipped the script on literally thousands of nasty people... forgive me if I laugh instead of weep.
Awesome chick's on this site.😅
Those glasses?? Or those bangs??? I feel like the bangs are absolutely a No-Fun-Allowed mentality
I mean reverse it and the pitchforks would be out
what does FOID mean?
so most of them are overweight, midle aged, karens??
I legit have been saying there was something like this for YEARS! Dating went down hill for me over the last few years and now I know why lmfao
Well well well...if it isn't the consequences of my own actions
"We wanna play the same game as men do, those filthy animals! ... c'mon NO FAIR, you were recording!?!?"
The hair cuts 😂😂😂
This toxic feminity has to stop
oh no! the accountability monster!
If you want to know how irrelevant these people are, this is the first I've heard of this crap. Sounds like this all took place over a week or so maybe?
Ok so they want a space exclusive for women but they won’t give men their own space?
Brother ewhhh!
As the wise man said "it's always the fridge brothers"
ye
So dumb cunts installed app without checking what it do and what it gained access to, use their phones with everything enabled, voluntary uploaded their biometric data, their government issued documents etc and now they are surprised that all of that suddenly became public? and its somehow mans fault (well, assuming that coders etc are male it kinda is  but you know what i mean)? Do they know that Nigerian prince want to donate them his wealth? Also FY google, if i want to call someone "dumb cunt" i will do so.
Can this app know if you're a man or a woman?
The irony of this whole situation was the tea app was protecting men not the other way around
That haircut tells you all you need to know...
Karen detected, opinion rejected
Users being outraged when their data is leaked while all what they do on the app is leak personal data about the other gender without their permission. Karma is real. I get that they feel sorry for themselves, but does anybody else feel sorry for these karens? Everybody who used the app is guilty.
Once again, Yandex shows how it's ran by a freer country than religious conservative fascist US
the App should be called Fea, not Tea (Fea means UGLY in spaniard)
I miss when feminism was about empowering women, not about downplaying men... Shameful really
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂 so cool
Next time I'm on a date = *give me a sec darling I've to check my Tea-list to see if you're in it*
So, it's totally okay for them to put up images and addresses of people on the internet, but not others. I'd call this Karma.
OinkOink Online Extravaganza 😂
Feminism is an excuse for Ugly women to be angry. And while they say they are angry at men, they are really angry at hot women
Karens when they get steam games banned ..."This is fine" Karens when their humiliation app gets doxxed ..."This is abuse"
Tea: It's a party.
Obviously a guy who work on his body and his career for 15 years, Will not pick an ugly or fat or mentally ill girl. Maybe those girls Instead of complaining they need to work on themselves and stop eating like pig's.
Hey bangs , stfu and make my coffee
Making an app where people can talk badly about guys is what she calls fun?
And i guess the one who made the app sas a guy,  i hope not
And they wonder why chivalry is dead
These women have standards! Double Standards
What's the game name?
Goblin women are mad that they are out in the sunlight.
Leave me in a locked room with one of them and a sack of potatoes and within three weeks I'll have a happy family with potatoes.
Yeah.. they're all failing the new pt test
Somehow this got even worse.. ----->> Somehow this got even better... There I've fixed it for you ;)
You know, sometimes karma is real.
the irony of creating an app to dox guys getting them all doxxed.
😂😂😂
Holy brother. This got worse. What the fuck is going on in this world lately?
I'm trying to find the TeaSpill game, but it ain't showing up anywhere.  Anyone got any ideas?
This is a perfect reap what you sow situation and the fact that they can’t see that shows how out of touch they are.
What if this application was intended to do this type of action from the very beginning? 🤔
How much you want to bet it was by a group of or couple of so called incel nerdy guys that the females have been outright crapping on them their whole lives because they weren't over 6', six pack 6 abs, 6" or more down low and oh ya making over  $1 million a year.  Because let's face it these gals are all tens and don't want to settle.  NOT......     From what I've seen of these gals here and other clips , they were the typical , if their mother didn't tie a bone around their necks the dogs wouldn't even go  near them.   LOL
Alphabet and smelly moderator heaven already started scrubbing all links to teeeeeefallsoverandmakesabigmess.... Good news is, I found it within 5 seconds on the orange search engine that has a duck on it.
It's called "karma" 😊
Video Games: *Making characters hot and attractive*  Them: This is an Avengers level threat!  Tea App: *literally doxxing women*  Them: Come on guys, it’s not their fault.   Double Standards am I right?
The perfect blacklist doesn't ex.........
My God! The most bangable thing that was shown in the video was Asmon!
Nobody would miss them.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say this whole Tea debacle was a PsyOp with the intent of exposing these kinds of women.  Or everyone involved is a f'cking dunce, idk.
Another 4Chan W
they want to doxx people but ironically get doxxed instead............ this cant be funnier, karma is a female breeding dog.
Those glasses are Perfect for Him 🤡😆🤣
They have no introspection.
She says incels are at it again, while rocking those glasses and that cut, the jokes write themself at this point
One girl with 1094 wins 1008 losses (52% win rate) and somehow bottom 50. Elo hell exists even there.
Is that hair or a hat?
You want to stay safe but you give your ID to an app on the internet? What next? You send money to Brad Pitt you are dating over facebook for surgery?
Classic
lmao
.and here thought women was attractive and intelligent.
think how much those ppl woude have flip out if we swap the gender target for that
Pattern recognition is a Thing.
Anyone with their septum pierced is just special needs. They have no brain cells at all
The HellDivers 2 raise the flag song goes hard on this clip.
*Women*
karens and incels.............. in this case karen incels.  accountability remains unbeaten by these femoids.
To her credit, she's reasonably lax because nobody would want to interact with her doxxed information at all
Karma
I thought this was an app for women? all these mugshots look like dudes
4chan, the heroes we needed.
This is another reason the UK online safety act is a horrible idea. Imagine giving you ID's to online sites to access the internet and then it will get hacked and suddenly the whole world know what sites you have been visiting.
The app is literally illegal because it only lets women use it.
1:28 what in the fallout 4 character  customization happened here
The amount of special needs haircuts is insane.
They are finding out what it is like when we do not let them win and they absolutely hate it.
HOW MANY SALTS, DO YOU WANT IN YOUR TEA 🤣
Looks like they got tea bagged.  ...again.
gender war
How is an App like that even legal, it is all about doxxing random dudes...
These types of women could hit a light pole in an empty parking lot and blame the car i swear to god lol
The fact they gotta display their weights upon sign up makes me think this was an inside job. And stop bandwagoning against Trump, he got E prosecuted and you saw him pointing out cameras like a kid in a candy shop.
Since they dox a lot of men and gossiping to it, I think they deserve a karma.
I see men are doing what they always do! Not take any responsibility for their own actions. Which lead women to need an app like that to help them avoid the bad apples. The men caused this on both sides! But you sit and cry like girls that you are being treated unfairly but don't ask yourselves why a large group of people across the whole USA would need this? Pathetic.
this is cringe content ngl haha
Hiding behind safety, always, to perpetrate awful behaviour.
Never think of safety on Internet, it's like you're provoking hackers.
0:13   It's the short fringe. That feminist fringe, everytime
so all fat chicks hating dudes t hey can't have is is their no level they wont go too.
Weren't women literally lying about being raped/SA'd and cheated on by the men they submitted on that app? A woman literally got shat on in tiktok bc she took some random guys photo saying that he's a cheater and girls should watch out for him, his sister saw that tiktok and WENT TO TOWN on her ass. In a women only environment women compete consistently to either be: the prettiest, the meanest, the kindest, the coolest and now the most oppressed to the point they will lie to garner attention, women only spaces are nice but women only apps? You're asking for total bullshit.
That barista calling men incels is gold. Why are the 1-5’s so mean?
They gave this app their DRIVERS LICENSE?
Ugh. 🤦 Please lord make it stop.
Great "bangs" "lady"
that haircut is epic.
As a woman, I love how these Westy whamen showing how big of a clowns they are. They are so brainwashed and entitled, it could be a good research material for Phd students lol
with that haircut she didn't want you to have "fun" time at all.
Coordinates? That's a pretty big word for a liberal feminist.
So they all go on there and pretend to care about red flags on men whom they can't date or what?
"No one can have a fun time on the internet" -If you fun time means being a creepy stalker who takes pictures of men and shares then on the internet then no, you most certainly can not have fun. In fact, you might want to find a new form of fun, like enjoying lawsuits.
They always want all the power with zero accountability. Always.
This is amazing lmao im 6ft 195 and fat. A chick that's 200 talking any crap is insane.
We wanted the Epstein list. We got the Tea list instead
men harassed and bullied online by women, women most affected.
Glad she knows the first few rules of internet club.  You're not suppose to 'have' fun, you 'are' the fun for trolls & of course the golden standard, there are no girls on the internet. even if you're a girl & admit it with evidence, then you're just a shady dude with very good catfishing skills. Duh obviously!
you spend the last few years invadeing men spaces demonizing them and making them feel shitty, and look what you get. what you fucking deserve.🤡
wait wait wait i can play fuck or pass with their photos sign me up. is there i don't want either choice. hitting that none stop.... booo hoooo poor haters got caught hating and mad that every one knows.
Look at that map. People saying stuff like “Get off the internet”, “Move to the country”. They’re crazy everywhere.
The app was composed of Gorlock's army.
I just can't with that haircut.
4Chan strikes again
yup just bunch of alien karen
0:15 Woman? Except that Adams apple sticks out hard.
I guarantee to you, anyone wearing glasses like those, is an incel.  The only intimate pleasure shes seen recently was provided by something requiring batteries.
Women will ruin everything given enough time, and they will do it in the name of feminism, which always masquerades as equal rights but is always about special rights.
The funny thing is apparently the most attractive woman on the app as rated #1 in the leaderboard on the game, is still mid. not someone very attractive. it speaks volumes that the most attractive of them is mid.
Is this man
Those are the girls that call you pedo, rapist and incel on social media too btw
Ok boys let’s seperate the ugly ducklings from the hot chicks, leave no stone unturned
he's talking about the glasses while im just focusing on what is that hairstyle
Good grief. Personally, I wouldn't want my information handed out so easily. Where's the privacy? So it's only okay if woman do it, but when men, suddenly people realise the issue at hand?
Okay this can't be legal even in the US this "app" has to break several privicy laws.
Here's a mind blower. Their all Jewish
The hilarious thing is these are the same people who want to "globalize the intifada"... apparently magically thinking they're going to get some kind of mass exception to being turned into someone's 10th wife and locked indoors in a burka all day.  Wait, shit, I'm supposed to be selling this as a bad thing.
All a bunch of ugly ham planets
"No one can have fun on the Internet" Lies. Have you not seen Teaspill? Loads of fun.
0:06 *Translation:* I can't dox and slander people anymore, and I've been exposed for doing so!! God, can't a girl have a hobby? Smh...
feminist are fat and ugly? Shocker.
you could say that they... *spilled the tea*
Another win for team misogyny. Literally all it takes is listening to and observing women at this point.
Look at those, I don't wanna be mean but they really made this Character presets as their "Identity" and the stereotype of being annoying and insufferable. They open their mouth to prove that stereotype.
And then they wonder why more and more western men are becoming passport bros...
Only 10% of Dating App Users are women. And normal women quit due to THE EXPERIENCE. What's left is female Narcicissts and OF Prostitutes. And somehow men still prefer this than going out and getting to know women slowly and via common interests.
As a woman I just wanna say I'm so happy to see this app turn into the mess it is. Who in their right mind wants to trash on some person, let alone a different gender while the app doesn't allow that gender to get in to check if there's the right stuff being said about them. These girls(they're not mature enough to be called women) deserve to have their profile leaked, if you're gonna talk ish about some man you don't like for whatever reason or don't know and insult his existence then you need to be held accountable for that when it comes back with piping hot tea thrown back in your face.  Yes exes can be horrific but even women exes can be horrific as well and imagine if that occured when a men's version of Tea is up and running. Reap what you sow girls😂
What!?! Ugly women trying to put red flags on nice looking men so that women they see as competition won't date them? Nah, women are not like that...
What’s really pisees me off is the women who are still swearing this app was strictly for “women’s safety”
5' 3" 190lbs Oooooooffffffffff
"somebody nasty" you mean all the women on the app?
The thumbnail as always is f-ed up😂
she talking about not being safe and her information being leaked, meanwhile she was orgasming from being able to just post people dick size, phone number email car their mother, pictures, pretty much everything   im starting to become gay.
When do we get to create the "hoe" app, we can share what they are willing to do on a first date
And these are the women calling masculinity toxic.
Been a while since we had a solid 4chan W
The female using the Tea app are 4's and below and below
so now yall understand why women need to stay at home and do their duty?
0:20 For SUPEREARTH! (Listen to background music, our editor is SUPER citizen)
ah, the usual suspects
Talk is cheap, show me your Teaspill elo.
New rule of internet, every accusation is a confession
LOL
For the most part, I don't like content about how women are bad. I'll make an exception for this one. This app needed to be exposed, along with its users.
Greatest Uno reverse card of 2025🎉
100 women vs. accountability ahh ahh shit
That fringe though.
Classic fridge logic
For those wondering, the hack wasn't even a hack. I was in the thread. Basically a gay guy made the app for women because his mom kept letting criminals rail them, used chatGPT to make it without knowing what he was doing, and the entire images folders, API key, everything was just public. Literally anyone could have taken it. And a dev with even a single semester of experience could have made something more secure.  It was all in a public AWS bucket. The only thing 4channers did was make a scraper to download it all super fast before they realized it was public. Don't use AI if you don't know what you're doing.
The really short bangs haircut is seriously blowing my mind it's so funny! Lmao!!
They got what they fucking deserved 😅  Also there was really no "hack" or "leak", the data was easily accessible to anybody with basic knowledge about websites and databases.
4chan used the Helldivers 2 anthem?   Based.
They look disgusting
Bunch of uggo cat ladies whining. Enjoy your cats
Repeal the 19th and all this nonsense will go away.
It is sad because apps like this are actually necessary because of how horrible some people are. Now making it so that only women can use it is where they messed up. If they made it for men and women to use then there would have been no problem.
Karen CLUB😂
0:00 Its face screams, "I'm a he/she", which makes perfect sense as not only do they "do it both ways", they want it "both ways".
So many refrigerators
If this was a warning app about violent men/rapists, it would be 100% understandable but it's not.
These women want their identity anonymous, whilst leak sensitive and personal information of the men who rejected them or made them any type of way  You can't complain about the security measures not strong enough while simultaneously give out information of others
Doxing app doxes users 😂
The database wasn’t hacked. It was all stored on a publicly-accessible URL. The 4chan user who leaked it just found the link…
Not with all the booze, viagra, and paper bags in the world …
the website sent me lmao
Just to make it very clear, the Tea app didn't have bad security, it had absolutely NO security at all
I don't think 4-chan and any derivation of the word intelligent should be legally allowed to be used in the same sentence.  You will be reported.
No one can have fun on the internet.........destroys reddit 15 years ago cuse dudes were having fun.
Do US personal IDs seriously have height and weight listed on them?
So they put their body weight on there? So they don't really mind as long as its only seen by other women😂
Hoes mad
I object to the app name! Tea is made from the sacred leaf. It's holy name should never be used to dox, and it certainly should never be spilled. 🧐
Those bovine Ladies are not DATING anybody. They are just on Tea for HATING everyone male
Unattractive, overweight, and above all doxxing other people and trying to ruin their reputation possibly through lies? God man, what has become of the US...?
I thought I was fat, but jeez.
Nice bangs, s**thead.
Ngl this was literally me. I remembered seeing vague footage of a cool knights with magic game as a kid and when my mom got me gamefly Dark Souls was the first game I got and NEVER mailed it back 😅😂🎉❤
Dude why the hell these woman look like a goddamn ork😂
Who are these women staying safe from, there's no shot anyone is agreeing to meet up with them unless they're catfishing.
OH NO!!!!! How many women fell for this app?!?!? ANYTHING that asks for your Gov ID SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED unless it has .gov at the end of an email!!! Holy shit that sucks!!! Lmao & smh & kinda feeling really bad for those ladies…
Yes I am "nasty", but the difference between me and them is I'm smarter
Deserved, because those are sexist femcels who organized themselves for their questionable pastime activities. Realistically true for about 90% of the app's users.
They didnt need the app to avoid guys...
Double standard is the only standard modern women have, and unfortunately the conservative mindset of some men helps maintain this double standard, because guys like that refuse to hold women accountable and treat them like children (unaccountable).
These people send their therapists to therapy.
I would only date one of them if I got paid their weight in gold.
Gotta love the super earth music
Why do all of them look like farm animals.
lmao stereotypes are real
So now they want to talk about ethics, and about the app? Gtfoh. And what's up up woth that hair. Sheeeesh
Everything that happened was predicable and expected. And so when it happens again, it will be predictable and expected.
The Tea App case is the prime example of why and how dangerous is using photos and ID's to verify your identity online.
This is the entitles plain jane now awful cretins
Cap theres no way those monstrosities ever went on a date
I have no words for the size of that
If u r woman, y r u on the internet u dumbfuck
I think things like this pulling stunts like this that they got what's coming to them. Someone shows up to their house and confronts them? Had it coming.
Usual suspects
Well done reddit.
4chan still active in 2025
What goes around comes around ... Bruh, women think some men are bad, but some women are downright evil. All you have to do is switch the genders in this scenario and then listen to the BS these people are spewing. The entire DOJ and internet would be headhunting for the creator of the app if the genders were reversed. These women are just downright evil and comically entitled ...
Why does he always act like he’s not ugly or isnt the same as them “I knew it” 🧌 same with his video on about why we don’t like fat woman or something, he’s acting like anyone likes him or something “that’s not why WE don’t like them” talking bout we when no one is attracted to this guy 😂😂
Once again, those who call others incels reveal themselves to be the ones who fit the description the most.   Kinda hilarious for this to happen, showing everyone what these people are.
Asmon is always right.
When you are to ugly to get some turn to the internet for satisfaction
Girls will be girls…
Tea Chicks: Government issued ID for Tea app: Awesome! Also Tea Chicks: ID for voting: YOU FCKN NAZIIIIIIIIIIII !!
I think the bigger issue here is how many women were willing to hand over government issued documents just to use a gossiping app. Not one iota of any sense of self preservation was detected here.
where can I find all these leaked data ? I'm a web app dev I have some fun legal ideas i want to develop
It keeps giving. The most ironic and iconic PII disaster ever I think.
App designed by women, for women, is inept, and steals *_all_* your information?  Sounds about Left.
Now people know where NOT to go to find good women! 😜
Saw a picture of the app that said "We won't use your data and will be removed later" or something like that.  Lmao JEBAITED SCAMONSKY.
A classic bunch of miserable unfcukable chicks🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
That DoD employee is about to be in a world of shit.
Yeah fuck that. They are lucky they only got called out and not sued. These malcontent women are such hypocrites.
That was a woman?
short fat and look like a man just wow and have the balls to call that they need 6foot 6figure 6pack abs and the only they can offer negative to the guy -friends -financials -peace the only positive they gave is chaos stress and headache
Got every address to avoid
No wonder decent dudes don't approach us.
Missandry is through the roof
That's crazy!
Women always.. always try to ruin men’s good time, they have no hobbies outside of jibberish and running their mouth, they do nothing outside of child care that matters
ROFL. TEA user base is THE meme of "those are the people that call you incels".
The state of those witches.
The meaning of fun for those people translates to toxic to the rest of whats left of humanity in this dystopia
You know what's funny is that many of my male friends have gone through break ups or divorces within the past eight years, partly due to politics, partly due to some strange mental shift during COVID; but you know who hasn't? The ones who dated and married girls from Latin-America and Asia.
so ... anyone have any teaspill links ? reddit moderators are quite active at taking them down because well , reddit mods .
Men make a app that calls out slags se how they like it lol
The most worried about being targeted and attacked are those who will 100% will not be targeted and attacked. Even when would-be attacker would be coerced
Looks like the whale population is looking better these days!
Got damn who let the hogs out
This proves leftist women really enjoy sadism or really enjoy masochism. There's no in-between.....
those bangs scream "I think ugly is the new hot". Friar Tuck in the front, party in the back...lol
1:01 Super Earth Anthem or am I just intoxicated on liberty?
I really like how instead of them being absolutely furious at the app maker and bashing them and setting up class action lawsuits against them, they're blaming men and the hacker known as 4chan. So you and other people put your shit in a storage unit. The owner of the storage unit not only do they not have any locks and keeps everything unlocked, they also left the doors wide open... and you act surprised and blame some unrelated third-party when your shit got stolen, instead of the storage unit owner?
It's funny how the hairstyle of the first girl tells you every single political opinion she holds.
Pretty sure this app was created for the sole porpuse of baiting these femcels into doxxing themselves whlist trying to dox men.   Get fucked. No one feels bad for yall.
you can tell from her weird little goblin mouth that she unironically laughs like a prohibition era gangster NYEH-HEH-HEH-HEH
That's literally gonna be the UK with their online safety act in a month. Just a more reputation-destroying website.
No one can have fun on the internet, This is the fun!
Femcels mad that their doxxing got unoed?
Women and their Doxxing Whisper Gossip Networks. That backfired real quick. So are they still mad that men won't approach them?  Today it is the Tea Leak App tomorrow it will be something else.
God should have gave Adam a drinking buddy.
People exposing got exposed i dont feel bad
Hey! Lets make an application that violates SEVEN Federal laws at the felony level!
The DOD ID may be a dependent ID used by families of military members to allow them to get on base. Doesn't necessarily mean she was in the DOD
"Obviously, there has to be some responsibility..." Yes, they're realizing! "...on the app." Oh.
I love this 😊. Serves them right. If you don't like a guy, don't date him. Definitely don't sleep with him, and above all don't hound him 😂.
Women get access to tech, and this is what they make?????
As usual zero accountability gang is coping that it was for “safety”
A site/app for Karens to leak people's information and that's seen as "fun" to these people. Why do they all look the exact same too?
the a fact a significant part of the leks indicate that they are all 200+lbs is doubly funny  these were the women that  were "ranking" men
Knew a chick who kinda looked like the bridge and septum piercing chick and I called her Nut Smella cause she smelled like my Nuts after work lmao
Tea got spilled, except the tea was a tsunami.
The crazy eyed girl on the thumbnail literally looks demonic 😮
How do those bulldozers even have any info to dox? Unless you get catfished, who the fuck would meet up with something like that? YIKES. Sidenote; why do american ID's have the weight on them? lol.
I'm genuinely curious as to what these women were talking about on that app, since I'd find it hard to believe that any of them have even interacted with a man
Lmao one has the worst haircut I've ever seen and the other has a crooked barbell between her eyes? Yea, these hoes need to have their own app for men to report on.
50% of those women wearing those same glasses must be a sign.
2025 is the year of exposing how women are incapable of accountability
They dox men but end up getting doxed, what a time to be alive.
1:44 they all look the same.
Stupid women, another fat L for the dumb broads
They have NEVER been treated bad by men! - men have 💯 NEVER been ANYWHERE near these absolute creatures! 😂🤦🏻‍♂️🙄 oh my god 😅
Rather than tea leaking, they should have called it tea bagging 🤣
0:34 so there ARE only 2 genders 😂
please reassure me - normal women don't actually think this app was ok to begin with, right?
Karma.
They’re all 2’s, nice granny glasses too.
I can just hear the collective "REEEEEEE!" if guys ever made an app like this that had girls in it.
App is filled with exactly the type of women you would expect lol. I swear they look like losers on purpose
the very definition of double standard 🤡
Also, you really think Tea gave a shit about these women's personal data? Fuck me, the admin password was probably 12345. This was a setup, and women are upsetty they fell for it.
I guess there really are female incels, I never knew they existed...
as you've expected
I swear it's kinda poetic how karmic their info getting leaked is.
Karma will get you.
Women that want to treat people especially men like dirt deserve to get clowned on by the internet.
"Fun"? So this was about "fun" for them? I thought it was about not dating felons. *Very* interesting
2 groups always win.   *The Internet*     and the *Red Pill*
can anyone give me the link to the game
The cut hair, say's it all...
HOGZ MAD
This is real life xD
0:11 I would never trust this “woman’s” opinion about anything…
Not all 3s or 4s, but ALWAYS a 3 or 4
1:49 Daaamn and they call Gacha gamers whales!
Whoever thinks that they can stay anonymous on the internet should take a cyber security lesson cus the answer is no
Jesus, women just can't stop taking the L these days, If I didn't like titties so much I would be gay.
"these people"   No asmon.... *FEMALES*
these women looked exactly as I imagined
What's with the haircuts? 😅
How did we end up here? We have pure evil on one side. Sex changes and lack of free speech etc etc etc etc. Nothing said will ever change their way of thinking and true thought eludes them. How did we get to debates on what a man and woman are in our society?   The reality is in the shadows pulling the strings. The puppet masters making an even more brainwashed following sheep class of followers. Thats how. The money power elite!!
“No one can have fun” Idk about that. Men are having a lot of fun with the leak.
Why do women ruin everything?
WOW that was nice of the "hacker" to not put their age next to their weight/photos.... guaranteed most of them are in their 20s yet look almost 40...
Imagine if a dude made the app with the entire premise that he knew it would expose them all
WHY DO THEY ALL LOOK OF THE SAME WOMB
How do they not understand that they were doing exactly the same thing that they are complaining about??
Why is it always the Whales, like holy hell- if men had an app like this where they do the same shit It would have been taken down faster than the speed of light
My god look at them
See this is this classic "hacker 4chan" stuff that we havent' seen from anons in a long time acting like this internet vigilante and exposing shitty people through a little bit of trolling
*tries to be a sexist online, app gets caught and hacked*  "Women can't have anything!" Ooookay chicky, whatever you say, into the hug me jacket, we have a nice padded room for you
Anything in everything that is a computer and it's hooked up to the internet Can be hacked. Now keep in mind, it is possible to completely secure your computing device. But the government does not want that.
Some say its a *really* fast torrent, too...
THAT HAIR WTFFFFFFFFFFF
While this is incredibly fair play, honestly, it would've been smarter to only release their pictures.  Then, when the press comes for men, there'd be that high ground of, "Well, we didn't put out their information like they did us."  With platforms like X and streamers like Asmon able to broadcast that fact, it'd throw more than just gaming journalists into absolute anarchy.
The super earth anthem playing lol
You guys have no idea what this means. If men get exposed they get fewer dates. If women get exposed they get injured or even killed. The consequences aren't comparable. You just call it a 1:1 match to feel better. Behavior like that leads to way fewer dates too, btw.
5f 3" = 1.6m, 200lb = 90 kg 5f 6" = 1.67, 182 lb = 82.5 kg Holy shit. Thanks God I live in Europe.
No one dating those soy girls wtf is up with that hair
Oh the turn tables how!!!
Israel succeeded in sterilizing the West.
1:48 at least give me a graphic warning first, geez
"no one can have fun on the internet" yes. because of the last decade and a half of people just like you
Women abusing men is so readily accepted that they made an app for it.   Women have a thing where they cause problems to get attention, and they stop when they face consequences (because then they feel that they are in presence of a strong man, which makes them feel protected).  This is why you MUST spank your wife and your children.
From what I heard, “hacked” is giving the leakers too much credit. Security was very poor apparently. Like publicly accessible is you just had the url.
When are we getting AI girlfriends? WE NEED THEM RIGHT NOW !!!!
In case anyone (for some reason) doubted that women are generally unable to take accountability for their own actions, here's this video.
Is there an app where we can laugh at that spastic haircut? These bitches need to know that they can't pull of those fringes....
crazy idea:  make an app called BEER does the same thing that tea does but to women.
Did you see the bangs?? Come on guys, nothing sensible was coming out of that face
Just a bunch of bitches who have never seen a gym.
Looks like we found where all the female trolls were hiding
At least this goes to show no matter how little chance with the ladies you think you have there's always a pool of these to go for.
The irony is lost on them.
"a fun time" you mean doxxing and shaming people?
The whole thing was a rug pull on all the ugliest women in America.
Did they take town the Tea Spill website? lmao
When I see catastrophe in Asmon clips title I know everything is ok. These mods lie
Man I am from Brazil and.... Why tf you have weigth in the drivers license? hahahaha
Female logic: an app we created to dox men just got hacked and doxxed all the female users. This is sexist!
They deny reality…70% of women are overweight or obese so a 7/10 is still a fat chick….that’s where we’re at
worse? or better?
Seeing that map showing them all over the country has really made me lose the last shred of hope I had for american women, I only expected to see hot spots on the coasts where all the shitty people are but it was EVERYWHERE 😐
Women: *attack men* Men: *attack women back* Women: 😲
All these women look like fucking turtles man
😁🤭biggest prank and gift of all time .total team effort on that,but hey the 4 chan crusade didn't have to do much on that end. Biggest of W's on them 🙏 now collective shout please and master card and visa monopoly getting  shut down😁Man if that happens i'll be the happiest man in the world and i'll scratch that off my bingo chart
their rights.      _why?_
Repeal the 19th
A see a pattern . All of them have either those glasses . Or nose piercings
was the responsible security a female by any chance?
There was a can of Dr. Pepper ranked #4 on Tea Spill, the Elo on it was in the 1700s. Keep it up boys.
I dont mind the ap.  Just reminds me why I stopped wanting to be around these toxic af hussies.  Every negetive review a man gets on that ap should be considered a trophey for surviving an abusive narcissistic man hating lady child.  Literally have an epidemic of female narcissists and they thought nobody would notice and everyone would just stay silent.
Karmas a wonderful thing, isn't it? 😁
this is so good for thefts
I mean, it's better to leak their data than something else.
What the hell was that for a bloody freak show?
I love how this doxxing truly qualifies as a victimless crime
I’m just happy this proves government-issued IDs are stupid
We throwin' the tea in the river!
An app about leaking information . Got their users information leaked . 0 sympathy for those people
1:50 put the fork down
"I'm a 10" "No" "But I'm 260 bro"
“Dating advice app” from women who look like that. Good grief.
This app is equal parts sexist and problematic
Bruh the teaspill game is wild XD. I wanna play so bad!
Imagine that, developed an app for the sole purpose of doxxing. And the main demographic of that app user are not fond being doxxed themselves.
Woke feminist make every thing worse for everyone else
I legit thought the thumbnail was Ai generated lol
She looks ewish to me😂, what a surprise.
"You get what you f'in deserve"
Dang... Ugly...
What is with those self-cut kindergartner bangs? lol And that dude was far too generous calling them "lower mids" because these B's are bottom of the barrel and the barrel in question was topped off with rotten fish and used hypodermic needles from an AIDS clinic.
heres the sick part, I bet most of them have kids too... there really be dudes that desperate out here 🤢
That's the power of makeup. I think we underestimate its effect on society.
You could have just you know not log the info in not secured dumps.
you lift the rock, YOUY SEE THE BUGS
Can we access these women's data online? All of them are reds flag for men, and we need to know who they are. Seriously guys we need this data to be public.
Why do they all look like.... this?
and again 4chan...lol...what a great group of maniacs
4Chan just dont bring down the Russian goverment become half of them are in said goverment, this guys are insane man💀
US citizens have their weight listed in their passports?
So now the Karens who got exposed will gonna sue the Karens who made the app and the Karens who made the app will counter-sue the Karens for exposing men's info and the rest of us will be there to enjoy the show.
those are the women calling men on the internet incels....
1:12 Zoomers still don't understand that the internet is NOT a safe place 💀. 1:33 Even the most secure databases get hacked. That's literally the Whitehats' job lmao.
Western culture has a serious problem when it spends so much time listening to cruel nasty people who roleplay the victim.
“So head on a swivel ladies” most these women don’t have necks for their heads to swivel on 😂
Ai needs to hurry up
This is insanity, I can't even make a comment against this doxxing garbage without YouTube instantly deleting it. I don't know what's more sickening this apps existence, or my inability to call it out for what it is in a public forum.
The thing I love about this is that it proves how big of hypocrites these people are, and that it proves women who overuse the term "incel" look EXACTLY like people expected them to. I also love the not so subtle mask slip with the one girl basically admitting it was "fun" to dox and shame men. The fact that they lack any sort of self-reflection or shame to the point that they then post a video complaining about what happened is just shocking.   If I ever got caught out for something that bad, I'd probably go silent for a hot minute because I wouldn't even know what could be said.
The Tea app is literally DOA
Mental patient, literally
I guess not wanting people to effectively dox you and go behind your back by asking random people yes or no short length questions are incels now?   What happened to reason?
100 women vs. accountability.
We salute for the Super Earth National Anthem o7
Somebody has to complile the data and put it in a database so we can do weight statistics
The entirety of female Antifa (femmetifa?) is in there
I say let them have it and keep the site. Just now as men we use this leaked data to created our own red flag app and add these women and send them a direct invite to view their page
Karens xD
country wide self own..
Tea app in the 80ies was called gossip. Worked the same way. 😁😁😁
Well, well, well....how the turntables...
Im confused, is it about safety? Or is it "having fun"?
Someone should convert this database into a Pokedex.
abominations
Pretty bold to call people incels when you look like that
Karma is a bitch
Sweet liberty, the ost at the beginning is from Helldiver's 2 flag rise
I fucking hate these neo feminists
People are way too comfortable sharing their personal data with companies.
It’s nice that this crazy lefti women use the specific haircut so you can avoid them easier 😂
Finding out is the hard part of fucking around...
Why is this website being hidden everywhere?
We all need to be right with God
Members of an online bullying platform upset that their victims fought back.
Damn, then the app for fat guys that will do the same is named “sandwich”?
Run , run from the fringe
Damn bro is up early i woke up round then 😂😂
Why tf are all these ugly, nose ring, hilarious bang , woke chicks allways in the middle of dating drama. If I saw chicks like these two in the video. I would also like a red flag warning about them.
lol
Justice! 😈
The men should be ashamed  😂😂. Wtf. Are you doing 😂😂
Is this called reverse sexism 😂
They ultimately blamed men. How original.
They are mad for doing the same damn thing really?
"...no one can have fun, especially if you're a..." Said the happiest person on the internet
This could not have backfired any worse for the app runners, they indirectly exposed themselves instead. God I love being a man 😂
Why are over half of women so fucking allergic to decency?
fun is not posting info of guys and do what they were doing. NAW HELL NAW fam
I'm sure the people on the Tea app are the same people that yell how they are on the good side of history, lmao.
These are some cool Shrek cosplays.
What the fucks up with those hair lines.
so it's just a bunch of hogs
Hahahahaha that game with the ELO haahahh. KARMAAAAAAA.
where can I play teaspill
1:47 I went to school with that girl, I still have her on Facebook, she posts 10 times a day mad about Trump, and gets 0 likes or comments on anything ever, she literally spends her whole life screaming into the void on Facebook😂😂
As I said somewhere else, expecting radical feminists to actually have competence is asking too much.
Bless 4chan
Wonder if there is a searchable database of leaked information.
The more of those leaked images i see, the more i come to understand why they want ugly women in video games
I love how she frames the person that shone a light on this nest of backstabbing harpies as "nasty". It's too late, my dear. Karma has already seen you, it's too late to cry now. I think if they can sift through this data and organise it some entertaining things could be done. 4Chan could recreate a Tea edition of the classic game Guess Who by going through their data. "did she use the phrase "small dick energy?" *flips over some tiles* "did she use the word "ick"?" *flips over more tiles* "Is she a gold-digger?" "I've got it, it's Karen!" 🤣
that app was the social equivalent to the Mixer Dimension in rick and morty
How the hell is weight on the Id? Wtf
Where can I find these leaks. I wanna see if anyone I know is on it
Didn't expect to hear the Super Earth's National Anthem in an Asmon video, Editor got proper taste in games!
Thanks 4chan 😂
I don't see the problem with the app on itselfs because there's a lot of cheater and fraud if I understood the context like it was supposed to save people from cheater and fraud?
Something Something "Rules for thee, not for me" Something Something _IDK, I don't their doxxerhypocrite language_
Thats no woman, thats a trap~!
Another case of the "I'm just a girl 🎀" bs. Double standards piss me off so much
spill dot info dot gf
GDPR breach at its finest (I think if some one from EU is on this site with all his bio) they can sue the ass of the creator of the app and the person that posted his info without his consent.
Bro. Why. It's ALWAYS the same glasses. You can tell 100% of the time if someone's annoying based on whether they wear those Karen glasses. It's like a flag for them or something
Karma in the finest
Remember TV from the 80s and 90s when it portrayed US women as some of the most beautiful in the world? That didnt age well.
Do you write weight in passport or what lol
asmons fan base be like
Does the Death Stranding 2 Picture mode work for verification. I thought about having my wife sign up so I could check it out. Glad I didn't.
Stupid is as Stupid does
Look at the hair is just..
There was a version of this app made for men. The App Store banned almost immediately.
All these women look like they were hit by the ugly stick.
Lorax: "That's a woman?"
Green bone in nose. Gulp.
The fact that they really managed to succesfully bring upon the wrath of 4channers upon themselves and of all people and communities 4chan has to come save the day. What timeline are we living in..
Apparently it wasnt even 'Hacked'.  According to /g/, the way the app was coded the information was freely publicly available online.
LOL, why do all of these folks have their bangs cut so short?
wait you have weight and height in us IDs ?
Deserve to get doxxed blackmailing and slandering people on the internet and spreading misinformation.
"No one can have fun on the Internet" The fun: Doxxing men
Was there anybody hot on the damn thing, or was it all just... Monsters
why did this app even exist??? society have shifted in favor towards femalesl .. no females are getting canceled. so why do they have to do this in a "private" app? they cant just help themselves cant they? all the gossiping and backstabbing is just built in with them
If that's their idea of fun, then there's no feeling sorry for anyone...
nothing made by women will ever have good opsec
I disagree with Asmon sometimes... But... This is absolutely abhorrent. This literal femcel is calling men "incels" for outing their complete misandry. Why are her bangs glued to her forehead like that?  It seems like most of the men reported are men that they wanted but could not get.  How would an app called, let's say "Coffee" that was ONLY for MEN, and that this app helped inform other men of who the biggest sluts are (for example), and/or which women were lying about the way they look (because they use 10M filters)??!?! Actually, an app like that should be made, and it should be called "CATFISH"
They should rename it, Gargoyles 'R' us 😂😂😂😂
The elephant in the room with all of this is the double standard towards toxic behavior from women.  Society is quick to throw the book at men like Andrew Tate and Myron Gaines for "misogyny", yet when it comes to blatant misandry like this, they're very quiet.  I'd argue misandry is more harmful than misogyny ever will be.
Is this why they desperately try to ban male only spaces ? because they're scared of men doing the same thing they're doing privately within their girly groups?
Apparently that shit was not secure No shit😂😂
Hold on, how are they even allowed to exist to begin with? and why these women still free? They literally doxxing people left and right and they didn't get jailed for doxxing? I thought doxxing is illegal?
What got leaked is way out of my league..
And they got dates how?
There's a podcaster who claims that everything women do is under the permission of men. If that's true, men quickly vetoed this app, lol.
I feel bad that I feel good about it.
How are these women even dating anyone
Not all middle-aged white women, but somehow always a middle-aged white woman. I would not be surprised if the women there shared explicit photos of their past partners with other women to further emasculate them, which I'm pretty sure could be classified as revengeporn and be very illegal.
Psychology of most women: if I am not benefiting from the status quo, I will try to drag as many people down with me as possible
Just calling everyone incels ha? Like tf
Its always the pierced ones who make a fuss
Sexist app about doxxing men, used by mentally ill dog ladies... What a sad existence to chose in a world full of wonderful opportunities. smh
Imagine a men-only app made to document women and their properties including their names and photos. Just imagine
man i feel like i need a shower after seeing those pictures
1:28 f***ing hell kray kray
And there you have it. The modern, Liberal female. No fukkin thank you.
man I feel bad for those ladies. no wonder they needed a safe space; the got the survival instinct of a rock. an app asks you for a picture of gov ID and you just give it?
I guess you could say the Tea 👓>🙂 Got spilled 😎
ew
☕☕☕☕hahahahahaha wemen hahahaha ☕☕☕☕
“4chan’s Intelligencia” 😂😂😂
Bring back coalfax and tea can stay
Crying cuz they lost their safe space for doxxing guys…
The little Pooh bears can't resist a honey pot ig
if ugly chicks want to keep each other from bothering us then i say put me on that thing asap. seems like a gift from god
🤣🤣
4CHAN INTELLEGIANCIA should be establish
Let men have fun.
Imagine losing a job opportunity because the ghoul from HR responsible for hiring uses the app. She sees that your ex went full psycho and had a crash out on the tea app, committing libel and defamation against you. But because they're both creeps that use the app, she decides to believe it and not hire you.  Fuck that app and every single one of its users. No sympathy. Women weren't using it to protect women, they were using it to harm men.
I have never come across these random elite mobs in my server before but i hope i never do
Seeing these heffers sitting around 200-240 pounds while Im sitting at 148 and drunk as hell is funny to me. Get the harpoons laddies!
The irony of "hey only we get to leak data, its not cool if you leak ours" is astonishing
Those fucking bangs
they gonna fall for a random guy named agent john smith who claims he's from the irs lmao
My god. No worries, AI and robots will help man to escape such clowns....
You do realize that even the hottest Hollywood celebrities look like this with no makeup and bad lighting
Rules for thee but not for me because "women's hell you nattzi biggot REEEEEEEEEE".
The Tea App is the greatest thing for Men. It point's out all the Women to avoid like the plague ! lol 🤓
If I'd look as f*gly as the first one with the weird haircut, the glasses and the potatonose, I would be even more pissed off. So if I'd be you, I'd rather be me xDDD
This is the "Final Boss"-App. If gamedevelopers have no idea how their villain shoul look like, there you go!🎉🎉🎉
I didn't knew leopard would eat MY face!
I thought you will get hurt! If I knew we have  equal rights I would never do that!
Somehow they look exactly how you expected them to look like and people always complain about stereotypes. 🤣
Correct. Get off the internet and leave it to be a boys club like it always used to be.
I need the address to said game
Did Tea allow Trans Women?
The people who made the tea app could double dip and make an app for men that shows if a women has a tea app account. Cause that's a giant red flag to not date them right there. 😂
Don’t they have an ounce of shame or even a little self-awareness, complaining about their own photos being leaked and that it could ruin their lives, when ruining lives is their whole brand? The hypocrisy. The audacity!  Imagine child mol-lesters complaining that someone hacked the app they used to lure children, now claiming to be victims of some man-hating people because their pictures were leaked and their lives could be ruined... _"Oh, but it's not the same! We're the good ones, we're on the good team!"_
GG guys 😂😂
I have but one word for this, good.
Don't worry, 'ladies'...  You're are 'safe', whether there's a leak or not.
Female mullets: no business, no party—just feminism.
1:48 oof 💯 googol
Whoa I'm surprised she even knew that old golden rule....
That wasn't even a "hack", all of that data was in PLAIN SIGHT
100 women vs accountability
'Fun': Translated: getting a place where we can defame men and assassinate their character without their consent in order to validate my own experience where I was a douche, but wish to avoid accountability and ensure that the man pays for making me feel bad about myself undertaking my usual behaviors Incel: Translated: man who calls me out for the fun'..
For Super Earth!
Dammnn all these women ARE MEEDY (means not good)…
Damn they all troglodites!!!
Talk more about einstein and stop with this shit
Nevermind the glasses. Having a fringe, or lack of it, deserves instant jail time.
RULES FOR THEE BUT NOT FOR ME 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥
Uploading their weight is just so perfect
salute to those 4chan hackers
After seeing the pictures of these women on the tea app, I don’t believe for a second they went on any dates. In reality it’s pictures and information of men that rejected them.
Reddit is worse than 4chan
I was pretty bad at my cybersecurity course, but its reassuring to see that there is always somebody more stupid than you
Women having fun doxxing men:   Men having fun doxxing women:   Women: "Shut it down, fun's over"
Maybe not GPS data per se, but exif data from photos. Which usually have information about the location taken in their data unless you disable it.
CONSPIRACY THEORY INCOMING  the security was so bad and everybody that wanted to get into the app needed a photo of theyre ID my suspicion is that whoever made the app is either dumb as a rock oooooorrrr and here comes the theory: they wanted it to be leaked  what if it was 4chan all along and then some other 4chan users just asked for acces to the app and bada bing bada boom doxxers get doxxed
These women want fictional dudes who are like 7 feet tall, superathletes with bodies with 1% bodyfat, who are the ceo's of billion-dollar multinational companies....and they look like The People Of Walmart candidates.
Can anyone please provide a link to mentioned teaspill game, the internet search isn't very successful, too many games with similar names.
Not surprised by the appearances
Yeah, because an app called Tea....do it.
Anyone remember the old "Bubble Tape" commercials from the 90s? "It's 6ft of bubble gum for YOU...not THEM" *Them being the Karen in those glasses*
YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS SHIT UP SOUTH PARK CAN LAY OFF THEIR WRITERS
Spilled the tea has never been so accurate!
Karma
Perpetual victims
260 lb is hella lot of works
why are they ALWAYS ugly??????????????????
"apparently the app wasn't secure" the app was created/coded by a woman ~to quote female CEO in that clip that we've all seen: "A Female CEO of a European company showed up to an event about encouraging women’s participation in tech and said that she doesn’t hire female engineers anymore because female engineers are lazy and not good programmers. She said that male engineers are better and more hardworking." also women: the patriarchy REEEEEEEEEEE
Bruh... I'm 6'1" 180lbs and I want to lose weight... WTF some of these chicks weight 180 at 5".  Also, why these weirdo lesbos always have these retarded bangs? I don't get it. LOL
Bless 4 Chan 🌹🙏📿
Like the app was by definition the thing they scare monger about Incels or PUAS. Secret forums where evil things get discussed.  EXCEPT THEY ARE ALL OPEN TO ANYONE. Unlike this shit. Doxxing people behind their back. Jesus.
This level of hypocrisy should unironicly be a criminal offense...
Why is there a hell divers 2 anthem playing in the background?
This is peak 2025
1:25 it shows THEIR HOME TOO. Ok no it straight up is a doxxing website
Classic wahmen. Posting people's private information online is just fun until it happens to you.
4chan will bring justice to all. Praise be brothers. Praise be
How do I find the map?
The only time doxxing is cheered upon
Forget about the leak... why is the app still available for download?
Common female L
4chan is one of the best things on the internet
Everyone is in the wrong except me!
I guess "fun time" depends on who is the one having "fun" at the expense of which group.
its great that they all have those special glasses and crazy hairstyles. it makes them easy to recognize and to avoid!
They should call the internet police……. IYKYK
How could ANYONE think prohibiting men from entering the app was a good idea.
All of them need to be behind bars ASAP.
It really is impressive how a community of trolls wields the power to get shit like this done so quickly
Funny, while watching this video my democracy levels raised by 15%, with an urge to salute the flag of Super-Earth.... Huh.
Helldivers anthem in background les go!
Stalkers got stalked and now they're mad! This is going in the history books!
*send her gov id to an unknown app *gets leaked *surprise fat pikachu face
I love that they all have versions of the Simple Jack haircut. It makes it even easier to spot and avoid them.
what they wanna feel safe for, they literally publishing personnel information of men with full details , last i checked law, usually people get sued for this and wasn't this supposed to be a crime publishing someone's sensitive information without their consent??
Those glasses and that hairstyle. They live in the easiest time in history and they can't help but to create more problems.
6 am, and i stumble on this   Bruh
plot twist, app was created by 4chan
I don’t know how to tell ya‘ll this but no website is 100% safe.  That’s why you shouldn‘t Share Personal Info on any website.
Friendly reminder to anyone in the UK right now what happened to the tea app will also happen on any social media app that requires you to show id following the new online safety act
Did they not allow men to write the security code?
This is the female equivalent of fat, broke, neck-beards creating an app to dox supermodels who refuse to date them.
Hypocrisy is a woman's strongest weapon
Must be one of those vibe coded apps that’s going to “put software engineers out of a job” lol
I suppose it's just more validation for this type of woman who perceives herself as a victim, while living in one of the most progressive societies on the planet.
Just to be clear here. NOTHING WAS HACKED.  A lot of people are being misled that the app was hacked. There was no hacking. They literally vibe coded and failed to consider any security. It was all publicly placed data.
LMAO roasties REKT
God it's going to be amazing watching the doofus that made this app get sued into oblivion. Guys gonna have Molag Bal as a cell-mate by the time it's done and I'm all here for it.  And the fact that the doxxers on this app got doxxed themselves? Mmm, chef's kiss.
Wow, so US ID cards have peoples weights, that's nuts.
Imagine if men made an app like that. Would throw the western governments and jurnos of the world into a frenzy.
Same women will call you a pedeofile for just existing, the actual audacity is astonishing.
1:03 perfect
It was uploaded to a public bucket. What a joke 😂
Why do I have the feeling this was all planned from the start? Make an app that incriminate all its users with all this identifiable information and GPS locations then "get hacked" by the Sharty. It's brilliant!
Lmao don’t worry, noone will go near your coordinates
Quit it with the bangs, it looks ugly.
"I do think there is quite a lot of responsibility on ..." "oh, is she actually going to admit that doxxing people on an online app is just begging for unpleasant consequences to arrive?" "... the app" "ah, so close. i guess it was foolish of me to think any of these women wouldn't think of themselves as being absolutely perfect adn incapable of doing any wrong."
The audacity 😂😂
First thing i learned was, never put your identity on the internet. If a servis need my id i dont use the service.
Each face reveal is another tally
hail 4chan
The tea got spilled! It leaked all over the country waaaaaah
so, to summarize :  They had fun to create "tea dating advice" to share privacy of men and have "fun" with it. And, When the men are copy them, and doing the exact same thing, it's not fun : It's violence ! for me : it's simply using a mirror to show the root of the violence.
So women trying to dox men, got doxxed. Now normally i can have some empathy for people wronged, but karma is just to funny sometimes.
These are the exact same women talmbout the male loser epidemic🤣
these women look like Joe DeRosa!! look him up- comedian
This is the craziest thing I've ever seen or heard about the internet, I'm 32 and have been in front of a computer screen from age 6. Women are... are women even real?!
"If you trade in lives for likes, don’t cry when yours is bankrupt. I don’t want you cancelled — I want you jobless, nameless, and forgotten like the people you ruined."🤷🏻‍♂️
The two actually aren't comparable. Tea included pictures, personal info, and gossip none of which the males consented to. Teaspill only has pictures provided by the females.
*The glasses? That haircut dude...that haircut...* 😲 That gave it away within micro-seconds (such a predictable fashion for some, signaling their agenda). What is this? Is the 60's Beatles haircut back in fashion, but just on women now? Blue or green hair would have been the icing on the cake. The only thing that surprised me was 0:09 that she more or less refered to herself as a woman and not as some non-binary or something like that. Ohhh and 1:28 w00t is that? 🤓 I guess just another predictable fashion (within certain circles) with again that haircut in the forehead. 🤣
I love 4chan
"not enough security" What security? It all was open for public from the start lol The fact that you *thought* and *hoped* that you stalk, insult and gossip about men anonymously - doesn't mean that it was really so  😆
That is Quick, i thourge i see that thread on /pol/ just day ago..
Never fight the autism.
You beautiful bastards, you've done it again!
another j e w got exposed.
this just shows how much propaganda American women slurp compared to other places
"Tea App" ? Judging by the appearance of the women there, it should be called "XXL Cola app", just saying.
Who is wasting time with this hogs?
wait so the Tea app can get weight info for profiles but tinder cant? Not gonna walk a chick home when she might have a heart attack on the way
Dear ladies that's sad when you're 5'2 and you weigh the same thing as a healthy guy who is 6 ft 2. Sorry girls the guys who are over 6 ft like me ,we do have a weight limit.
Well boys, its time to make a catfish app, I know a guy thats got all the data we need
Ahahaha.
that nOSE
So people leaking personal information got a taste of their own medicine? Serves them right!
lmao!
good job men.
nose rings too
A "fun time" doxing men? Wow.
At this point Tea seems like an intentional honey pot, and it attracted a bunch of pooh bear lookin ass b!tches 😂
The absolute state of women in America. There is a reason why our ancestors kept women under patriarchy for 99.9% of our history
dude, the oversized glasses are a 100% life hack, oversized glasses=  CRAZY A F
Let's add, this was on a PUBLIC database. Someone literally just stumbled upon it
If you check the website they have an ELO ranking list. Top 50 is all thin white women with an Asian or Hispanic thrown in for good use and a csn of Dr Pepper at #50. The bottom 50 are app fat black women. I'm not sure what that is supposed to say but it says something.
That forehead is wild.
rule for thee but not for me 🤡🤡🤡
Why are all of them bellow average?
1:30  *weezing intensifies*   What is this, Lord of the Rings?!?
The majority are built like Blastoise
We got the torta list before the epstein list😂
Fun? These women are EVIL
Too funny
so she admits pooping on men is fun for her .... two can play that game
And they said Internet would be good for people. Here we had humans rating other humans behind a closed door, and most of them spread lies, just because someone was not 6ft+ or rich based on their Tinder profile and didn't reply back to them. JFC.
you really dont wanna mess with 4chan users....
1:01 Was that the Helldivers music that plays when you raise the flag or have I been playing Helldivers too much lately?
Last one looks like a chunky zora
The tea was spilled
Damn…someone spilled the tea on the tea app…lol
Wah! The incels! WAAAAAH!
If i was an "incel" coder it would be a smart move creating and selling an app that gathers all the grossest hags n hogs personal information and then having it "accidentally" leak, I mean having foul harpies pay to have their own disgusting views exposed and leaked - well thatd be a pretty baller move if you ask me.
1:03 Is that the Super Earth galactic anthem!? XD
I enjoyed this
Never mind the glasses, that problem bang alone (the only bang she ever got)... anyway, looking at those degenerate train wrecks, I'll guesstimate that at least 80% of their "iNtErAcTiOnS" are figments of their demented imagination to begin with. My real questions are: 1. how did this lunacy pandemic come to pass and 2. why are we still wasting attention on that shit?
I really want to play this game but I know I would suck at it...
Why does every woman on there or complaining about that have a haircut that looks like a pug's ass after it backed into a space heater?
Immediate name calling, calling guys incels, the "can't have fun cause men" attitude. I can't feel bad for you at all. How much do you wanna bet that the first girl spread nasty rumors and make up lies?
Jeez, they need to stop overfeeding these poor creatures.
Let them fight
where can i get this game?
Shes wearing 2 glasses
Calling it a "hack" helps to redirect blame away from Sean Cook (CEO of Tea) so please don't contribute to that misinformation.
the thing is there wasn't any backend security whatsoever, it was quite literally a url with all of the unencrypted information stored on it. Makes me believe that it was vibe coded with ai.
wait... you have your weight on your ID?  thats wild.
They're the real assholes.
For anyone wondering about the game its spill/info/gf replace the / with dots.
I'm sure there are still some normal women out there too but how do the insane ones keep multiplying. The ratio seems to keep getting worse and we're already past critical mass.
But but but its okay when we do it
Modern women: Why are we all so lonely and single? Men don't approach us Also modern women: OMG Men are predators, and we need apps to track them down
i mean getting doxed on the internet isn't a huge deal
Based on the average user, they gonna have to rename the app "Eat."
The " She's not interested! " friends.
Nose Rings... Nose Rings everywhere!
the bitter tea has been spilled
Some guy on Reddit or Twitter said "this leak was like 9/11 for ugly women"
Have they tried confidence??
This video might get struck for showing their pvt info.
You gotta love how they cry about "muh safety" when they literally gave an app their government-registered ID information telling them exactly who they were, where they were, complete with contact info.  If the hack didn't happen, the corporate blackmailing likely would have. 4Chan did these femcels a favor by getting to it first.
These women look like they smell bad
HOGS!! THEY ARE ALL HOGS 😂😂😂! YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SHIT UP!!
Women attack men on Tea, women exposed for being petty, vengeful and sexist = woman is victim.
I love how they all look EXACTLY how you would expect these lonely cat ladies to look  No hot, sexy women here......  Just androgenous miserable activists....
the app made by women?
Dam, I'm impressed. They took care of that IMMEDIATELY!! Good shit boys
Which crazy man has contact to these humans?
didn't expect that many informations to be leaked but thats the karma i guess
the hair 😂😂😂😂
this is so fun to watch bro
They won't ever take accountability for anything that they do wrong.
I ain't complaining about the leak. But for fuck sake... If these groups are hacking anything, wtf are they not hacking the government and trying to gain access to info related to the Epstein files and list? JFC.... Do something fucking productive, you bunch of orange-fingered 4chan fucks
" hack " is a stretch.  All the information was public. It wasn't hard to find.
I guess Verification Selfies didn't have filters?? lol
"You're on an app that's entirely dedicated to leaking private info" But it was _men,_ so it was fine. Now it's _women,_ who got their info doxxed, and that's just wrong.
You don't get it.  They were just posting personal data of men for revenge and fun, but the people who posted their personal data were meanies
Who bedded these gals? Have some self-respect.
“Especially when you are a woman”  VICTIM MODE ACTIVATED
"FUN" for them is belittling men.  Gotcha.. SO FUCKING GRATEFUL I met a woman who isn't like these fem-cels.
shall we make a FEMALE version of such app ? and get SHUT DOWN 5 sec after it's release and then listen how pigs man are on TV and internet for the next few months ?
Disgusting. 🫣
How come Tea app users all look like THAT
>aww we can't dox men who give us the ickies
"That's terrible! How could this happen? That's awful! Oh no!" ~Prime Minister Dankula  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
why is her hair like that?
Sinve when "fun time on the internet" Is code for "talking sh*t publicly behind my ex's back"
This whole situation feels like a genuine example of karma in action. It's beautiful to behold.
have a fun time? A FUN TIME ????!?!? Way to make misogyny great again...
"Fun time on the internet"?  doxing lol
0% of those women that rated any men had any actual contact with any of them ever and now its a giant victim cry fest. love it
You know for a fucking FACT men didn't do shit to these women other than not want anything to do with them based on how terrible they look, men avoided these whales like the plaque so it made them all butt hurt and now they themselves got fucked even harder in return. FAFO.
4chan, weaponized autism 😅 Absolute fucking legends 🤣
🤣
One may be balding but at least you don't have this chicks hairline... Wtf is that?!
0:10 "Especially if you're a woman"  This person does not look like she knows what a woman is
not a single decent looking person LOL how in the world
well that was created in bad taste so i guess what goes around
spill info gf
Your IDs have weight record on them ? How is that even possible when these people can crank up the gluttony anytime anyday ?
Why do they always look the same?! 😂 Hope they enjoy the taste of their own medicine.
"Somebody nasty was able to to access these images and personal info...." says the nastiest people on the internet. Karma's a bitch and sure as hell doesn't look like these troglodytes.
helldivers theme background?? lmao
I swear every time I click on an Asmon vid. I have to start off by saying "What's this? 😠"
Will never understand single women taking advice from other single women on dating. Shared misery or something?
If these women want a man so bad, they should try losing weight. It’s all about that calorie deficit
"We can't have fun on the internet without doxxing and virtually harassing men we don't like"
*Me taking a picture of my ID to give to pr0n companies  NOthing bad ever HAppens.
That haircut lol! Name is Lloyd, Lloyd Christmas!
I just realized now that the App was made by AI, how convenient
Two types of people
wait why are we calling this the "tea leak" and not the "tea spill"?
game link?
4 chan will never change, and it should never want to...I think another big question would be the grounds for defamation....but I do love the irony that its okay when women are exclusive and violent, but when 4 chan notices that's when you know its fucked up
Yet they wanted to dox others
Humiliation will continue until moral improves
Those women calling us Incels??? Oh the irony lmao.
“Let’s leak info and talk behind the backs of men” *uno reverse card* *Surprise Pikachu Face* “That’s mysoginy!”
"how dare you doxx us back!"
Boo hoo.
Ruuuun from these women
So dumbasses sign up to a doxing app and are all upset when they get doxed in return? Hilarious stuff. 🤣🤣🤣
Now we have a pretty good blacklist of girls to never date or contact !
First time in history leaked gos location will be used to avoid that place.
Can't wait for internet historian's video
stories like these are 10x better vs what disney could cook in last 10 years
we live in a matriarchy
Waiting til we find out this was the true purpose of the app
Now I understand.. one who never work out want to see male in woman sport because they jealous skinny sport woman and want male to destroy it.
I'm actually so happy for this set of group to get docs like this because these people are the reason why we didn't have the right to repair cuz they got scared by corporations into believing that people would be able to hack their cars and figure out where they live and turn their brakes off but also in that bill would have been laws that would have given you the ability to say what information you share with an app and what you didn't want to share with the app as well. But nah you had to get scared by BS ads
I love these stories that get me  laughing like the Crows in Dumbo.😂😅
Oh noe! We were just trying to have fun doxxing people, and we got doxxed for that! Women are not safe on the internet!  This logic is mindboggling. Like, exactly what they did happened to them, and they're complaining.
1:47 "Eww, brother eww. Whats that?"
Calling this a hack is a big stretch. The data was saved in a public database with no encryption. It was basically accessible for everyone.
Fafo
1:01 Is that Lilly Tino on the left?
Acting like a bunch of teen girls in the high school bathroom...except leaking personal info on a public website. Which is now proven Very insecure.  I have no sympathy for you and your idea of 'fun'.
Doxxer gets doxxed "ITS ONLY OK IF WE DO IT!!!!"
Remember fellas: Karma is a BITCH sometimes. You reap what you sow. If you're gonna doxx someone, expect to BE doxxed.
I love karma.
So not only did the doxxers get doxxed, but they even made a knockoff hot or not site? That really is just the sugar in this tea of irony.
When the second "woman" came up on the screen I instinctively slapped my screen.
100 women vs accountability
What's with their massive foreheads 😂
Now I wanna see the statistics that show how many trans people tried getting on this app but got rejected because they couldn't pass.
Female incels leaking private info of men complaining about their private info being leaked 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You have their locations. Thats good.. very good ..
It was never about safety, it was never about ANYTHING other than engaging in protected criminal harassment of people they dislike. Anonymous criminal harassment without any responsibility.
Tf is up with their bangs?
I can’t find the game in the video 😭
How are American women so ugly. I know your population is fat, but this shit is unbelievable. For every beautiful American woman I see 10 ogres.
The app was made by one MAN....I guess he forgot to close the toilet seat on the app.
Why did they call it "tea"? Should have called it "Big Gulps" because that's all who use it.
welcome to get out of gene pool.
SSS grade women everyone of them. Sad Sacks of Shit.
They all look crazy as shit honestly, they have no right "rating" dudes unless they wanna get rated themselves !
They wanted to create a list of undateable people. Mission accomplished.
disgusting double standard as usual :)
Epstein
Wow they're literally whales lol but uglier 😂
No one can have a fun time on the internet is a strange way to call what is essentially slander and defamation.
Im here for the Super earth anthem in the background
So they're okay with doxxing men but then cry victim "women can't have FUN" (fun as in doxxing someone?) when the same happens to them?
Was that Super Earth National Anthem?
"200lb"  Ma'am, it's illegal to lie on a government ID.
This is a classic BruceDropEmOff moment 😂
"you don't understand, it's only bad when others do it!"  Also it's both funny and sad that they all look exactly how you'd expect.
OH NO!...... Anyways.
ugly people are so annoying
Wait, did I get it wrong, there's an app that requires full ID verification that supposedly leak male users data and allow access to female users. Which, in turn, got its female users IDs leaked by a third party, that enraged Twitter femcels? I must have got something wrong, this sounds like a South Park joke rather than reality.
Damn they're chonky
bunch of lows and mids doxxing chads they can never date?  many such cases.
"But it's only wrong when it happens to meeeee!"
This is so funny because look at all dem uggos.
Is this animal cruelty? Leave the cattle alone!
''Wow you cant have fun on the internet doxing men and being a sexist woman! You're just so unfun!!''
Democracy protects. O7
female version of an losers. How should we call them? 🤔  Ps...they need to be sued for sharing personal info of people without their permission.
Hahahaha WE ALL KNEW IT
An entire app of terrible people gets doxed while being actively terrible. What a tragedy.
They said people can't have a little fun? Well, the people exposing them are having the same fun that the ones being exposed were having. The "nasty people" were just leaking nasty people!
Just look at that woman... ofc anyone looking like that would have an extreme hatred towards the opposite sex lol.
Confused European here. Do US passports have a "weight" entry?!?
The obesity crisis is getting worse.
Damn, the women on that app are HIDEOUS!!!
Were Trans admitted on the app?
ngl i actually support 4chan here. what, you doxx men and expect yourself to not get doxxed?
Serves the big whales rightly
Equilibrium
Can someone signup for Tea app if they identify as a Woman?
It's always the 2/10s
For anyone itnerested the link for the teaspill can be found on 4chan's random board, just takes a bit of scrolling. You welcome
Yuppp they look exactly how I imagined them to look
Can’t have fun… especially women? So it was fun? Making up shit about men who dumped you coz you was toxic as f?
play stupid games win stupid prizes
I guess they tried ‘tea-posing’ for dominance and it backfired. 😂
They dox men; complete with home addresses and phone numbers. They make unsubstantiated claims about men, no evidence, in an attempt to ruin their reputations or worse. They use the platform as a way to gossip or defame such as when a girl posted a photo of some guy with the title "He gave me gay vibes, don't date him". They discriminate against men by not allowing them access to the platform for a chance to defend themselves nor do you see any posts about lesbian partners being exposed as red flags (lesbian couples have the highest rates of domestic violence) which would also be looking out for "women's safety" -- only men. Always men. All of this coupled with the fact that it's founder is a homosexual man and one begins to wonder if this is really about safety or if it's more so a ploy to make man hatred as mainstream and as destructively effective as possible. Remember that the male version of this app was taken down in less than a day of it's launch. That alone should tell you everything you need to know about this situation and any situation similar to this one which follows the 'rules for thee, not for me' blueprint. This app may have started off with good intentions (emphasis on 'may'), but as they say: "The road to hell is paved with good intentions". This app is criminal and it's users are not just as bad, but *worse* than incels. At least incels know they suck. These women on the other hand are extremely bitter, hateful and delusional to point of grandiosity. This is misandry gone wild and it's bound to end in self implosion -- but not before taking many innocent people down with them. This is disgusting and pathetic. This is a giant lawsuit waiting to happen. THIS is toxic femineity.
They lined up real easy for that govt digital i d didn't they?
You forgot those bangs inspired by the  leaf wearing cannibals  on an island somewhere .
the haircut tells me all
why do all these people have, let's just say, a very "unique" sense of fashion
TIL Americans have their weight on their identity cards, that's amazing
By the way, it's even worse than all that! This wasn't a hack. The app itself downloaded all of this sensitive user data to every single copy of itself. So as soon as a user uploaded a pic of themselves and their ID and it collected all the data and geolocation, that all got broadcast out to every other user. So all you had to do was download the app and all of this data was sent to your phone. No hacking of server(s) required. Easiest "leak" in history, since the Tea App was apparently designed to leak everything to everyone. This is what you get when a bunch of karens think they can just build an app, likely using some sort of AI, without knowing how to program.
So the app outright doxes people, and it's supposed to be "a little fun" huh?
Nobody can deny the holeocaust
This is the feminist movement right there.
lmao the Helldivers rising flag music on the background
dude who bang those landwhales to ghost them in the first place
So the men who had there info added to this app can sue for defamation and other lawsuits
1:57 THIS IS A WOMAN!!??? I am telling you man I have NEVER been caught so off-guard in my entire life
With all that info, it'd be nice to have a map of the US, with the gravity wells of the users.
These women are horrifying to look at
4chan for the win 🏆
Her: "Somebody nasty was able to easily access these images..." Me: "YEA, YOU!!!"
My my, how the turns have tabled, comrades. 😂
Why would you hand over your government ID on a dating app. That is just a catastrophe waiting to happen.
I don't know men that would be with those ugly whales. They don't have anything to worry about.
That’s what they get for using an app to justify their toxic behaviour.
rip bozo
Female incels whenever men do something they don’t like: “The incels are at it again.”  Also known as, “Refusing to put up with a woman’s toxicity is misogyny.”
If they purely wanted to be safe then they wouldn’t be revealing random guy’s info
Umm that person that was part of the Department of Defense should not be taking pictures of their Common Access Card (CAC). Thats a HUGE no no.
Nothing is secure. When they say a company has been hacked all that means is someone at the company or who had access to the computers has downloaded everyones personal details onto a HD or memory stick. So it doesnt matter how secure your data is online as its only as secure as the people who have access to the system and anyone can be bribed or have a grievance about something at work I dont think people quite understand how much their arses are hanging out in the wind...
Its disgusting that they basically created a social media platform where other people control the and edit the profile of other people   As others had suggested users could just slate any person and make anything up about them and the actual person would have no idea or the ability to see it
The haircut gives it away EVERY FUCKING TIME!
She/he?
Kinda like Ashley Madison!😅
Heh, so we can still watch Asmongold in the EU? I'm surprised our overlords in Brussels allow us.
were the glasses a group buy?
It's sad these are the exact kind of women i pictured using this app. Like judging men? Can these linebackers  even get 1? Well ig if they could this wouldnt have happened would it?
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT
The counsel of the unfkables got nuked.
Doxxer being doxxed. Ah, yes, very sad...    Anyway,
Karma in it's purest form.
the chopped ones
It amazes me that they all wear similar glasses. Why?
What the hell is even that?
FAFO 😂
Worse still...  *All of it was in a PUBLIC REPOSITORY ACCESSIBLE BY URL*
Ofc these peple now plays the victim
they leaked the USA Tanker Association
"We just wana feel safe." >willingly gives all their private information to an insecure private company :surprisedpikachu:
Classic pussy privilege by insufferable feminists
man never thought i find what a bowl cut be on a woman now i know
Average female dissonance.
Getting to use the app is more secured than voting
They say don't stick your dick in crazy. Ladies, don't let all the crazy stick your dick in you. Nothing good comes from promiscuity, actions have consequences
Total truecel victory
260lbs is crazy, I don't even weight that much and I'm considered as obese in my country
There is a very small handful of cuties on there. Everyone else is terrifying to look at
It wasn't leaked. If you can access it by a URL, it is published. They published the data.
You know, 4chan is full of pervs but they do something heroic ever once in a while so I can't be mad.
Gesu, those haircuts 🤦🏻
0:18 helldivers theme?! 🗣️FOR DEMOCRACY
What else do you expect from weak species 🙃
Speedrunning 1000 green flags, by signing up as a fridge.
Based incels
What a day to be gay.
There are photos of men in there and they are doing better than some women.
these are the creatures passing judgements on other people? lmaooo yeah right we are the  'incels" sure. Look at your face in the mirror lady you gonna stay single forever. That's a face not even a mother could love
Is her hair real?
I support this leak.
4ch hasn't had a big sting in awhile. It's good they are keeping busy again.
The only thing more unbelievable than an app that requires photo identification to use becoming popular, is the suggestion that any of those hogs were able to get dates to begin with.
there was no "illegally accessed", "hacking".   The gay dude (owner of the app) pretty much had open url  jpge's of the uploaded driver licenses.    And his motivation for the app was so he's mom can hook up "safely" for her ex con fetish - let that sink in
this whole situation is bad, but i'm stand on whoman side. 95% of the time they just afraid of abusive, agressive relationships and want to protect themselfes, thats it. we usually can easy protect from woman, they not. this video is complete misogyny and bully. not a fan of this.  for example, i'm totally ok to be discussed on this app, because I know I did nothing bad to anyone.
Imagine being salty that you got doxxed because you're on an app specifically for doxxing people 😂
"clearly didn't set up enough security measures" there were no security measures
why are women built like a linebacker afraid of men
This  is not good news. They had all the hags herded into one place talking themselves out of dating me. I feel less safe now that they are let loose again.
Do I hear helldivers 2 anthem in the background?
The Infamous Bull Nose-Ring
the funny thing is you can't even call it hacking.
This is poetic karmic justice.
"Somebody nasty was able to access all that info" ... you're the nasty ones
The hacker known as 4chan strikes again
You know she hates men by having that utterly stupid haircut. I wonder who messed her up at high school that she's like this now.
Crazy take: Half these women if they started a diet and were more feminine, would probably get a guy
Hypocrisy really is the theme of modern societal values.
The App was for doxing men and they're mad that THEY got Doxxed dumb hoes bruh 😂
Dunno if I'm a bit slow, but what exactly tea app leaked about men? Isn't it only public info and photos from men's own tinder or whatever? Plus personal experiences with them from whoever dated them?
4chan is the epitome of chaotic neutral
Never upset the weaponised Autists of 4chan. Praise Kek!
If a Karen is calling you an incel, you're doing something right
These female are nuts leak people personal information with them not know it  does this count female it more a creeps than male? Does These female know that leak personal info can lead to jail?
Does Americans needs to document their weight on id-cards?!
“You’re now allowed to have fun on the internet, especially if you’re a girl.” -The people who do everything in their power to make sure men can’t have fun on the internet
It sounds like the Tea app is a spinoff of a Facebook group called Are we dating the same guy. They all chase after the same “good looking” or “wealthy” guys who pump and dump them. This is hilarious.
I threw up at the end.
Taking bets, on the gender(s) of the CIO/CTO who runs the app and didn't look into security?
Dude why do they all have those same bangs
Flat earth dave levels of app safety.
Lmao they actually think this is about safety. Maybe gain some wisdom and discretion if you can't see red flags in a guy
Being mad your app to doxx people was instead used to doxx you is pathetic
I have never been happier to be gay.
Why are they so ugly?
The app itself feels like a bait to me , they wanted all their infos but didn't protect them almost like they wanted to get hacked
Always the same traits....
Someone should make an app like this but for men. New content for weeks. And when they complain, we use the same logic as them. "We want to feel safe" "We deserve a fun internet"
Weaponised autism. The great leveller.
Feminists taking another L 😂
Who cares
Bottom 50 make a doxxing app, get doxxed themselves, how poetic.
Wait its just a buncha fat bitter karens trying to ruin it for young women? Who could've seen this coming?!?!
it so many uglies 😂😂🤣🤣
Thank god for 4chan.
"No one can have fun on the internet."   So, what she's admitting here is that publicly humiliating people is her idea of 'fun'. And her idea of that 'fun' being ruined is when it goes both ways. A moment of silence for the poor victim, she wasn't allowed to harass other people in complete peace and anonymity.
Somehow, 4chan returned
That last one can see your atomic structure.
Link to game?
Karma is demure
YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKING DESERVE
Karmas a bitch innit
If men wanted to shut that app down, there is a very easy way to do it. All you need to do is sue the app maker for sex based discrimination, and he would be forced to allow men on the app or shutdown.
Isn't it illegal to "spill tea" publically? What this app did would be illegal in Poland and everybody could be held accountable. I don't know how it is in US or rest of EU
Femcels calling dating men incels LOL
Hgt 5"3" Wgt 200 lbs
They identifies as wal/russ
Wish i could see the leaks :(
No one feeling sorry for them 💀
1:49 LOOOOL "YEP!" "There it is!" "I f*cking knew it, bro!"
Anyone got a link to the game?
This tea is sub mid
JUSTICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
It’s funny because women are allowed to say way more on the internet than men without facing any backlash
You weren't having a "fun" time. You weren't going: "Oh, this guy is so cute, but this one has a nice beard". No, you were straight up posting legal info.
Hey at least we know who to avoid now lol
Tea App is Toxic AF. Women just have a problem looking at $$,status, looks WAY more than men (By social conditioning i should add) and they are BOMBARDED by men so they have everything to choose from. Choose the average chill guys women and you might not have a problem.
"So somebody nasty was able to easily able to access these images and leak them." -Pot, meet kettle.
It was NOT the entire user database. They’re fishing due to recent violence
Look at the absolute PENNIES crying about this garbage!😝🤢🤮
Kinda sad that the game got taken down tho, at least it seems that way
Publicize all the sub-4 so we can avoid them for good
THE FUCKING SUPER EARTH ANTHEM IN THE BACKGROUND JUST MAKES  IT 10x better
Whole app filled with Frogan clones...    😂😂😂
I dont go on apps to talk shit about other people. And my life is going pretty good.
It is database of undatables
You know what would be the ultimate play? If this app was a psyop to get a bunch of valid US ID's so that scammers could attempt to steal their information. Not saying I necessarily want that to happen, but crazier things have happened before. Also, what goes around, comes around. Hoping the app gets delisted or a "men's version" comes out where men can talk about getting catfished. It'd be hilarious.
"Oh no, it's the consequences of my actions again"
I doubt a single one of them had ever been on A date.
So, what should we name this one, 4chan? Operation TeaBag?
"No one can have fun on the internet" The fun: "This guy is a grapist, he has super aids, and he only makes 5 digits yearly"
Oh no an app that if you reverse the genders It Will be seen as bad Is being cancel......   Also that's bad
Anyway here is a led sign...
In other words, the 'Tea' got spilled
Kinda like women wanted the "Men only places" like taverns or whatever (not saying it was right or wrong, but it was what it was, a safespace for men) to be shutdown and open to anyone and then when it happened under the no-discrimination laws, they started doing women only places.........And as far as I know, none of them got any trouble for it.
I mean its technicality their fault, because the code is public so anyone could just access that shi with ease.  Thats like leaving your car unlock and be surprised its gone the next day...
WTF is up with her haircut ? 😂
I fkn love 4chan
That dork dont even look female 😂
Super Earth anthem playing in the background
The male profiling site found out.
best hack ever haha dont fuck with 4chan who do you think made qanon and flat earth for shits n giggles haha
These women look like oblivion characters
KARMA.
was at about 0:50 that i realised the helldivers 2 background song was going
Those aren't bangs. They are explosions caused by exponential cognitive dissonance.
Not a single one under 175 pounds, insane.
how can i sue asmon for showing me the disgusting pictures of those creatures near the end of the video
With the app being so insecure, and having public facing data, what if...the people who created this app wanted to have it leaked after all these F E M O I D S joined, minuscule possibly bur funny af. Imagine the creators were a part of the 4Chan raid 😂😂
Lawyers salivating
Again, it is not hard to find a female DL and spoof an account as a man. These women are not only toxic they are not smart. That's an ugly combo
They all look exactly how they behave
Play Count Dankula "oh no" clip...
India has the untouchables, while these people are the unfckables😂
1:26 jews: Fellow women, you must ruin your looks and make yourself as unattractive as possible, to own the patriarchy! Women: You got it, girl!
ew those females are gross looking
On one hand exposing someone's personal info like that is bad. On the other hand they were happy doing the same thing.
👯 16-30: I don't need no man 🤱31-36: Where the good men at 👵37-45: I'm still young 🧟46-death: I made a mistake ☠️ Last word: I blame men
so an app about doxxing men by women were then doxxed and its somehow still our fault for some reason. can try not to stop doxxing people but i dont think self awareness and taking responsibility is part of these womens characteristics obviously
We are surrounded by Victims.
Who would've guessed? It's the usual suspects
Leaking ex partners personal info used to be done on the darkweb now we just do it on public.
btw, this also shows exactly why you should be very concerned about having to give your government ID to porn websites to be able to access them.
Is that the fucking super earth anthem
Can't believe these poor women are having their private photos shared around and mocked when all they wanted to do was share around and mock people's private photos, the world just isn't fair
BREAKING: Women don't take accountability and try to be the victim.
So it's a dating app for low hanging fruit?
Wtf are those haircuts?
Yea and ALL of these women "dated" red flags 😂😂
Lol who tf ask for govt id for verification
raising the flag for super earth over here 😂
KARMA AHAAHAHAAH
They so afraid of men because they hate men. they should look for a "soul mates" instead.
"noone can have a fun time on the internet" every man getting harrassed on the app "Tea":
Dude, I checked the teaspill voting site. I am amazed that even one fifth of them actually had a single date.
It's ok to be fat, it's ok to be ugly but if those people are doxxing and judging people based on looks then they open themselves up to that shit too
Yikes.... bunch of disgusting whales... God... my eyes...
Rules for thee but not for me
the blackpill community always win brutallll for the sub5 foids
Appropriate - Tea for Bags LOL
I love a cup of tea.  Strong tea.  But why does the 'tea app' even exist? 🤔   M 🦘🏏😎
the tea app devs should and users should be arrested for privacy invasion. its ok for us but not ok for you
good luck pushing this app in EU ,  lol , people rush to hate regulations and yet.
the helldivers 2 music at 1:00 had me rolling
It's profiling.  which leads other worse things anyways.
1:03 I can hear Super Earth national anthem from a mile away
Just looking at her, i could tell shes a terrible person
The only men who have ever wanted these women are their stepdads, and even they outgrew them. 🤷‍♂️
Most of them are heavier than i am😂
all praise the 4 chans, when they want you exposed, it is not a matter of if, only when.
I’m still not even shocked it’s all obese woman
Not gonna lie.  Fact nobody said that somebody spilled the tea. ... I'm dissapointed.
Also that hair is not even fun for everyone
So staying safe for them means exploiting other people's information, doxing, and possibly destroying their lives in the process. Any excuse to continuing being mean girls.
1:01 FOR SUPER EARTH! o1
Mental gymnastics of these women to do shit they did on this Tea app and then act like victims afterwards
So they say that the stereotype of women talking only about men in media is not true, but they have an app for that?
the 'F' after 'sex' stands for 'Fuck no'
wow last one was nuts... 5'3" and 200lbs the biyatch is built like a pokeball dayum... let me guess... her preference is nothing shorter than 6' and has to be earning over 6 figures...
LoooL ;D
They are so unfuckable 🤣
Poetic ending!  LOL
I remmeber in the early 2000 there was an identical website that was just flipped, men reporting on their crazy exs. the site not only got shut down, but its creator went to jail.
Funny, they are all so unattractive so they probably got rejected by men. You see when men get rejected we move on eith our lives, but when these bridge trolls do, they dox the men... its okay when we do it!
Everyone mentioned on the APP that didnt want it or approved it, has a possible class action lawsuit. It could sink the company completely and I hope it does.
260lbs
😶  The bull ring has been used for generations as a safety measure to control an animal.  The septum is a very sensitive area, so a tug on the bull ring will help to bring the animal into submission🤔
I actually look into it, It was all in a public database. Littlerly nothing stopping anyone from peaking.
You're gonna get sick of winning
4chan intelligence agency? what?
Ah, doxxing and defaming people on an app is "fun times". Gotcha
The app shouldn't even be legal, or even exist
Is the Tea app like the biggest form of being an Incel if we use the word like how these women do?
Abominable fringe
Godo
fucking hilarious that people that used an app to dox and harass people would complain about getting doxxed themselves and claim "that it's ruining their fun"... just the level of self awareness...
Did nobody tell them that even no one leaked their information, they risk their identity stolen from them? I reckon some services only ever need a gov't issued ID for proof of purchase.
That one with 4 chins is insane
i also have fun times on the internet spreading miss information and photos about chicks ive dated. except if i did this i would have done it via 4 proxies,
This is not a tea, its a mayonnaise.
"Oh no, somehow when I was leaking information, MY OWN personal information was leaked. How dare they?!"
"Oh no, what happened? Oh no, how terrible! That's just awful, how terrible oh no!"   😂😂😂
Monkey strong together! Unga bunga
They leaked the Shrek List 😂😂😂😂 come on people, are this really the females that cry about males? Half of them are male and the other half is transgender or believes in 284747494030 genders and sex with animals.   If a female like that chats with me I will stop the chat and I will be on the site, all because I’m a good looking male and they are not even human 😂😂😂😂
The incels are at it again "That's me "😂😂
isn't it amazing that a group of people that gather around to talk bad about other people where you can make lies about those people which could ruin their lives and leak personal information is consisted of ugly women.
This how the Epstein list should've be revealed
How the tables.
0:02 99% of these women are gonna stay single for the rest of their lives and not be able to hold any meaningful long term relationship cuz of their toxicity yet we are the so called "incels" lmaoo
You play stupid games you win stupid prizes
These are women nobody would ever date
Who let the hogs out?
look at those pictures. these are the humans that call you incels. let that marinate for a minute.
There is a reason why evolution has developed us in perception of others through the prism of appearance. Once again, this confirms that monsters are stupid and you should stay away from them.
i think it's those bangs and not the glasses that let you know that she won't be any fun to be around 😂😂
If the complete list of Tea userbase alongside their pic + weight are leaked, nobody in the world is gonna want to get involved with a modern liberal wimin.
Ranked tea is insane
Somebody nasty she says. She doesn't even realize the entire app is full of nasty people.
is it just me or the editer is playing helldivers 2 music in the background
If these woman had kids, we wouldn't see so much mothering of adults in the world today...
I think people need to start to realize these feminist women actually COMPLETELY understand their hypocrisy they just dont care. They feel like they can give out the personal information of men while feeling horrified when it happens to women because women especially like this are psychopathic and lack any empathy at all the to opposite sex and don't see us as human beings. To them, men are either prospects or problems.
plot twist : the app was a trojan horse and the goal was to expose those woman
People massively underestimate the danger these liberal women pose to society. We used to deal harshly with subversives and then we stopped doing it. The result of that has been devastating.
They say once she sniffed some Coicaine and the dealer was never found again.
I don’t download things that are made from the government
I love 4chan 😂
Certified Woman Moment Many such cases
🍒All women look exactly as you'd expect 🤣 painted hair, tattoos, nose piercings and my elementary school teacher's glasses 😱 SHOCKER! who would have thunk there's NOTHING feminine about'em 🤣
what kind of freaks are these anyway? lol
damn that Versus game with ELO number in it look fire xD
How tf all men on the appstore look like they live on the gym😢
We should make an app for men, that shows the lasses body counts and how many bbdaddys they got.
That's like that one dude that doxxed ICE agents and got doxxed himself then cried about it. Treat others like you want to be treated. Treat them like garbage and dox them for existing? Right back at ya.
The God Emperor protects! 4chan for justice.
Who is this hacker 4chan? Is he a system administrator?
Their double standards are unreal. It's only safe when they're allowed to shit on men, but when it comes to the men shitting back on them, it's no longer safe. Gotta love 2025.
They all look absolutely undateable.
"Let women have fun" -Women when they are called out for being toxic
Meanwhile the women feminist group Collective Shout tries to censor the adult themed games, and later surely all somewhat offending games.. Talk about taking away the fun...
Editor forgots to mention again that the database did not have any security. it was public facing amazon bucket without a password
They found chonker HQ
LOL HOW ARE THEY INCELS IF THEY ARE YOUR EXES?!
XD
wait, so just one women signed up multiple times? 1:47 on?
imagine the absolute OUTRAGE that would occur if the roles were swapped and it was a mens app
😂
technology before 1980 to 2013 ❤️❤️❤️ but modern era in 2016 to 2025 🖕🖕🖕👎👎👎
Im so going to play that voting game tonight
Like everything else women ruined it by weaponizing it against men out of spite.  And we all predicted that was exactly what was going to happen.
Link to the game?
They shud make a website with all these women, where men can like, dislike and comment on them
Doxxing men you didn't like was just "having fun on the internet"? Oh well by that logic, those insells you hate so much are doing the same, although they didn't didn't doxx you, you did that yourself signing up to that vile app :D and their game actually looks like fun :P you "ladies" accidentally discovered EQUALITY <3
Everyday it's something new with that app. I wonder how this is gonna get worse for those chicks tomorrow. It's unfortunate, but they really brought it on themselves. Now, they know how those men feel.
This person fought a lawnmower and lost
just blame and you are good lol
охуенно
Lmao
1:50 260lbs(117kg) making fun of people
"Women aren't allowed to have fun" Fun in this case literally meant doxxing men and slandering them... Yeah, these women really do have a twisted way of having fun.
characterizing the type of activity on tea as "having fun on the internet" is sociopathic. coz it wasn't just "staying safe" they were doxing people.
4chan Intelligencia 😭
The Doxxers got Doxxed and dont like the taste  of their own medicine. What a sight to behold!
I bet None of those women actually dated the men they were being horrible too, i bet mainly it was a pity party just to be vile to men
karma
We’re raised not to make fun of how people look but hoooo lee 😂
That haircut she’d be lucky if a hobbit would go out with her.
For women doxxing and destroying some random mens life is called "fun". Seriously how evil can you be. This equality leak happeend and offcourse they play the victim and blame the app and not themselfs for it. Typical.
Besides the trauma i just received, that would require bleach to get rid of, we can at least try to look on the bright side. If those nightmare's are real, then dreams must also exist.
It sucks their info got leaked I get it, but come on. It didn't occur in their small minds that what they were doing was technically doxxing too? This app should have been banned and shut down in its first week or even day 😂.
Why they all look like that?
So a app got hacked where woman expose guys and leak their information then did the exact same thing with the people using the app now that is just Karma
Hell yea Karma, wanna doxx the other? getting doxx themselves
They look like rotten meat and they dare to call people "incels"... Bitch, I can literally smell you from the screen, STFU.
And here in the UK they’ve made it so you need to upload a selfie as an adult to watch porn. Can’t see anything going wrong with that 🤣
Lol, the Helldivers anthem in the background :D
Cow app
Where can i find all this?
These people are calling you Nazi by the way
Leak? It is a leak when small droplets comes out of the pipe. Judging from this size of the users I will call it a burst
The Tea App is just a place for narcissistic women to hate on men.
You know for a fact that woman never interacted with any men. So its hilarious that other women would take what she says about other men seriously.
Hogs mad
They need to lists the users of this app so guys canavoid them.
that crazy hacker 4chan still at it
soo many redditor mods
I love it, how many time we men gotta G check these females till they just stop we no the same period lol.
I wonder if they consider the government issued ID requirement to be suppression and the women-only rule to be gatekeeping.
The femcells just keep projecting especially when their allergic to accountability 😂
Was that group for women who look like men?
why they all look like hippies man
As I usually say, what you give to the world is what the world will give back to you.
its the Angry Karen club
Everyone can have fun.  They made fun and insulted people and now people make fun of them.  What goes around, comes around mf.
Short blunt ugly fringe, giat nose, thick-rimmed glasses, dark hair, dark eyes, complaining about incels because some randoms leaked user info from their digital witch hunt app. Smells like Jewry.
Got the Edna Mode haircut “NO CAPES!”
Why are the only women commenting on this men hating lesbians?
Karens...
Jesus they're all 180lb+ wtf
That haircut
With the Tea app, they automatically assume that a woman’s intentions and actions are pure and just while also assuming that a man’s intentions are malicious and wrong.   Their entire argument is, “Men better treat women far better than how women treat men otherwise they’re misogynists.”   Their “empathy” is a one-way street. Ironically actual incel behaviour….
btw it wasn't even a 'hack', all the info was there unencrypted. You can access it via hyperlink.
They hosted the database publicly it wasn't a hack they did this themselves breaking quite a few data protection laws here in the UK. So by enough she means none there were none you can get to it using their url structure
What did the company heads think when all the IDs came in for verification but all the people looked the same
I've literally never even met a woman who looks like this. Where even are these people? Bagging groceries at a Whole Foods in Seattle or what?
These women should be the last to worry about this kinda stuff. Gross
Women and accountability don't mixed well do they
The users are look exactly what i had imagined lmfao
Did they really create the game and where can we get it? 😆
"Oh no, everyone is doing to me what exactly i did to them. This is so unfair. Why should i face the consequences of my actions. I didn't do anything wrong, its the misogyny. REEEEEEEEEEEEE" - Every tea user right now.
Was she wearing two pairs of glasses? And what the hell is going on with her fringe?
Such low heights and high weights. I can see why they were all mad enough to join a doxxing group.
Women doxxing and lying about men: 👍🏻  Hackers doxxing and posting the truth about those women: 😡
fun part is it was legit all public to anyone that knew where it was located like no protection at all
All these hogs scared of men, not realizing they're the safest kind of people, easily never to be approached by a man - the 5'3" 200lb on average kind.
Lo
1:03 what's the super earth anthem doing here
I assume their developers were only DEI hires.
I have lost years old accounts of games i loved just because recovering the password needed pictures of my actual face and ID, fuck that shit. 15 year old wow account? Bye.
The Liber-tea music in the background 😂
Apparently these women never heard of the word KARMA. Or maybe they heard of it with some bizarre definition.
So, like When they make a full app for leaking personal information, it's "wow, so useful, and ABSOLUTELY NOT TOXIC" But when the the group of people this app targeted information gathering towards used "reverse Uno card" move, it's suddenly toxic and "women can't have fun anymore"   I am a girl, but god, Jessica, if your fun is made by doxxxing dude who didn't want to kiss your feet and pay for your BadDragon at the first date then I also think you shouldn't have fun  P.S. hail 4chan users. Most of the time i hear about them they act like some kind of superhero. Basically finding people that think they can get away with any nasty shit because internet is anonymous, and prove them idiots wrong
WHERE DO I PLAY THE TEA SPILL GAME?
A win is a win bois
"the incels are at it again" Modern empowered women cannot conceive of social status without involving their genitals
😂😂😂😂.
4chan W
We owe A LOT to 4Chan, their work over the years is gold 👈
A rare 4Chan W  It's like seeing a shooting star.
The Tea was indeed spilled
super earth music in the background, fitting LOL
Tea users worry too much. They are safe regardless. Who the hell wants to lay a finger on them anyway?
What’s with this chicks haircut???
Funny, they all look exactly how one would expect.
Man I love 4chan.
Nothing like giving your government I.D to some crAPP 🙄
Plot twist : the creator of Tea intended to leak everything from the start
*Doxxes people* *Gets doxxed* *Cries*
real time justice
I'm gonna play that game now 🎮
Never thought I’d see a girl with a worse hairline than Asmongold 😂
Passport Bor's are laughing .
"Its the rule especially if youre a woman" hur hur dur dur dur me cut  bangs me hate man me  me woman me hairy pit.
It's as the saying goes: "those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones"
Gotta love 4chan for bringing back the classic sport of whaling.
If you go over to the Tea Spill game there's men with higher ELO than 95% of the women there
Its not just glasses but haircut too
Taking some Tea while watching...
I can fix her.
so its a data harvesting operation for idiots posing as a man hating soft dox your ex boyfriend app. how are western women getting worse still?
Where can i find this game?
"Somehow this got even worse.. " ❌ No. "It gets even better now" ✅ . . . . . . . Bitch get rekt lmao
Now we need an app to filter out all these Tea users
The famous hacker 4chan strikes again
LOL not enough security.....LADY, THERE WAS NO SECURITY AT ALL! NOT EVEN A PASSWORD VERIFICATION!  It took 4-chan like 15 minutes....All of the code was left open.
4 chan do wonders
What do you call that haircut that looks like some Mel Gibson Apocalypto aztec warriors
women are incapable of feeling guilt
So someone scanned and uploaded their government ID for work? And they work for the federal government? Yeah someone's going to get disciplined...
Enough of these awful nose rings already.
The funniest part is that it wasn't really even a hack, the database was literally set to public, the security is so bad it seems as though they wanted it to leak
What kind of person would cut their hair like that?
thats a woman
4chan w
Another classic "It's OK when WE do it!" moment.
so it was a stalking app a doxxing app and a data extraction app
Can anyone sort the list by weight?
lmfao its filled to the brim with land whales lol
Those are ladies?? 😂
"Illegaly access..."  Nope. Nothing was hacked or illegally accessed. It was all available, open to the public, if you knew what you were doing.  That's why you're not going to see charges filed against anyone who "leaked" the data. Because "leaking" implies it was protected.  You can't leak what everyone has access to, even if they don't know they have access to it.  Nothing was leaked. It was only compiled for easy consumption.
"No one can have a fun time on the internet," should be restated as "It's only fun when I can make fun of/hate on others anonymously, not the other way around." What a bunch of losers.
Aliens from an agriculture rich planet could intercept this information and mistake it for a livestock sale! Head on a swivel ladies! Head on a swivel!
"If WE do it it's OK and "just a bit of fun" but if YOU do the same, you are evil and a threat to safety" is the T-shirt motto for the last 2 decades
just stop...
Anytime anything happens to women, its always the keep your heads on a swivel ladies.  No one cares Karen, they haven't cared in years.  Men are busy doing shit, they dont care about your shitty opinions, trolls pulled this down to mess with you and you took the bait.  But they dont even care.
UK just implemented age verification on the web. I guess the government has not learnt its lesson.
There's a quote from South Park, "When you represent poop, you get shit on." Gerald Broflofski
W 4chan damn love it when they win
Angry women like her used to scare me. Now I just see them as hissing kittens that just need to feel trust and love ...in their case it's just a chadrone with loads of cash.
my friend went viral breaking thiz on Twitter.
Aaaaand ofc its 4chan...
Usual suspects
*Problem glasses.*
It was probly the 9 year old brother of one of these cunts that hacked it! 🤣
what I love is that they look as miserable as you can imagine
common 4chan W
This is simply beautiful. What a time to be an incel!
Granted all the feminist overreach in nurturing market platforms.  Good, fuck'em.
That’s not a woman. That’s a cow.
This is one of the reasons I like Hackers
game link?
Omg we're just trying to have fun omggg it's just a bit of fun guys jeez
they mad they got doxxed like they did to men?  What men cant have "fun" too?
lol lmao
Does anyone know kw where I can find these files, and if the data on the men was leaked.   I want to see if I need to prepare a libel lawsuit
Usual idiotic females baiting to jew lobbies and jew propaganda to destroy humanity
Massive FAFO
"no one can have a fun time on the internet" the champs who leaked your stuff are having the exact kind of fun you were having. 🤷
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"
What in the Jabba the hatt...
Yes nothing shows staying safe then giving an app your identification...
They look just so fuckin' hideous. Guess the outside matches the inside.
‘Conspiracy to Stalk.’
probably the Karens from Collective shout are also on tea leak
Her(?) hairline is almost receding more than Baldemort
Old Fisherman would have loved this, a book of whales with their weight class and geolocation? Damn
yes the app was shit as hell, but so are you!
Average woman is 5ft 4 and 170lbs….
Leak info about others and your info got leaked. Karma can be funny and a bitch at the same time.
"4chan intelligencia" Bruh, my sides.
It's impressive how much time women spend thinking and talking about men they don't like. I work in a team of only women, they have like 100 stories memorized of "bad" ex boyfriends they themselves or some of their friends had
they're so disgusting
Anyone who used that app should be charged.
"Fun time on the internet"? You mean doxing and trashing men behind their backs? Yeah, zero sympathy.
Karma a bitch
waiting till the US implements the "alerta do flequillo" meme
all across the USA    do not date women guys dont even use them for some qucik puss
she has the same hairline as Asmon tbf
"women cant have fun doxxing men in peace!" what has this world come to?!?!?!?!?
Ah, the Super Earth National anthem.
It's not even satire, they don't even see the hypocrisy in being assholes calling other people assholes.
anyone wearing them glasses is a FEMCEL
Why aren't the Tea Site users charged with doxing?
Doxxer no doxxing
no wonder they were ghosted, look at those fringes lmao
Trust..  ther eis a reason why they all look the same..  left right.. collective should.. leftist activist..  They’re miserable.. and their goal is to make other women miserable — men really aren’t the target if you really look at the bigger picture.  It’s why one side attacks women that date, that want to find love, pretty girls in games, etc.. there is a reason why .. and the right side attacking pron cencorship.. again, old women  mad they no longer have fun and their cheating husbands are looking at other women  Very simple  Men are just the vehicle to attack and wreck other women’s happiness.. just like using kids is just a way for gov and activist group to bring in full government control
*MUH INCELS*
4chan coming in with another completely absurd accomplishment
does every women look the same in this app I love statistic cause of this LOL
I'd be mad too if my hairline looked like that.
What goes around comes around...  Don't hate player , hate the system .
Well well well, if it ain't the consequences of my own actions
W For men!!! Thanks 4 chan again lol
All hail 4chan overlords
Seems like 4 chan had fun.
I read about this yesterday, those people are doomed 💀
Why do they all look like that?
So it's okay when they do it...but get mad when 4chan does it to them 😂   Rules for thee not for me
Least I take the good morning tea.
First
That man with the glasses can check DEEZ NUTS
Boy am I glad I don't use shit like this.
first
Hmmmm
2 views in 13 seconds? Bro fell off 💔
Haircut?
Doxxer gets doxxed
They all look the same
Lol
