HOW MANY FRIENDS DO YOU HAVE?
Exactly what I was searching for.
Man. Ive never seen such an epic 2 player mode trailer. 😂😂😂
THIS GAME GOT EVEN BETTER
Now I can buy the game with this mode is worth it
We need that NEW DLC ASAP!!!!!
Yeah, none, thanks for bringing that up namco. Knew I shouldn't have stopped staring at the wall to watch this trailer. Feel like poo now knowing I never really connected with anybody on a level past acquaintance
Thought this was couch coop :(
Money waste 🎉
Devs. Please look into relics that do not work with certain characters.  IE Ironeye: changes compatible armaments skill to poison moth flight at start of expedition.
When devs listen to the fandom
buff revenant
4 or 5 pls!
Damn, now it will probably take forever to play with anyone since everyone will be with their duos My fault for not having a friend I guess
You guys have released 6 everdark sovereigns, yet there’s only two in rotation…why? Genuinely confusing design choice.
Ahora DE 6
Is this the Japanese game devs that never listen to the players i know? Peak trailer, really shows just how much dev cares about what the community needs and how much they care about players culture.
i just started playing this month and its actually good, couldn't play on release because i thought this isn't good and my friends are already 3 players so i thank seamless coop gods u can now play up to 6 players on pc
Happy Souls has been realized!
Customizable weapons before start would be fire being able to dual weild axes with raider before expedition or change to heavy bow or even dual katanas tend to find each play through hard to find certain weapons for my build
Now the matchmaking for trios takes hours. Great idea bandai
A shame this releases at the same time as the worst boss in FS history
Now we just need quads
New shadow tower game someday?
We need 4-players next, new bosses, new levels, double the boss battle and make them twice as hard and new characters to choose from
Bro im in the game (steam) my friend sends me the invite and i accept it but it says "failed to join team"please somebody can help me?
Now I can play with no one cause game is plat an I have 600hours for literally everyone
When it is properly working. I haven’t been able to launch a game of two once.
woow trailer only for 2 player coop? PLS GUYS MAKE IT A SERVICE GAME it would be  TOP 10 STEAM FOR4EVER
Waited for this last night and it got delayed cause of the earthquake. Yall couldn’t just drop it???
Go fix y'all connections errors issue before anything else.
delayed till tmr
why would u need a trailer for 2 player mode vro 💔🥀
二人プレイよりも本編の遺灰を出して、ソロ専のプレイヤーを救済してほしいんだが。オンラインだと、疲れてる人に一時間も集中力が持たないぞ。他のプレイヤーに気を使ってオンライン入りにくい。
No one asked for this 🤣💯
No time for emotes must farm runes
鍵ないんかーい😂
Split screen?
finally.
getting a trailer for a feature that should have been included is wild. Instead y'all should  Fix cannot join team issue
Can we get a 4 instead of every triple A game doing trio all the damn time plz
They need to do a trailer to announce this ridiculous! What we need is mode of communication. Simple this like "come here"  "look up ahead"  "hold on " "careful of trap/ambush" just basic things
the reason it took so long to add this was because they were working on the trailer
Esperando uma promoção,  esta muito caro para o estilo do jogo
How about you fix the horrible game performance? game looks like something out of the early PS4 Era and runs like crap lol
Immediately bought the game when I saw this 😂
How about adding cross platform instead of two player mode, I don’t even need a two player mode if we had cross platform cuz all my friends from Xbox could fill my lobby
Seamless coop is better!
Dos meses para hacer poner un jugador menos. EL DIABLO!
Now if we can squads next patch 4 players!
Now we need 4 players for the left out friend😢
2人で常世フルゴールに挑んでいるということは…復刻？！
Guy... the "Fort, Night" joke has gone to far🤣🤣
I’m still waiting for ridge racer
Ultrawide support. Solo indie devs add it to their early access games. Add it please.
This been a mode because 9 times out of ten, the blueberry would have their own agenda. I wish they would just add an actual system for communication like oh I dont know,Voice chat??🤦‍♂️
Fix your servers.  Can't even log online.
took them longer to make this trailer than it did for them to make this patch
Thank you thank you 🙏 😊 I did not expect this so soon, much appreciated 🥰
Common Fromsoft W
"We tried emplmenting it but it wasnt up to our standards" But we really want it! "Oke, we eill try our best to implement it." And they actually did!
That executor definitely pinged the evergaol forgetting that he didn’t have a key
Eh like I care about Elden ring 2 player mode, when they [I know from anothoer dev] should be doing Nier automata 2 in 2 player or Stellar Blade 2 player or Lollipop chainsaw 2 player
New Character class when brother?
This could be played in shared screen?
Hyper Hyper
Is this online or will we also be able to couch coop
I beat all in solo
Two player trailer? Are we deadass right now? 💔🥀
Did this really need a trailer? I’ve already been playing duos since one guy always rage quits 😂
Add more bosses?
Please give the .hack series some love for once!
There should be a ‘’ Hp bar only ‘’ HUD mode
Please add new sky boxes for future bosses, shake up the formula by adding new points of interests & objectives besides the same copy pasted camps & a singular castle. The shifting earths, craters & underground cities are really cool, more of that please. You can bring in a lot of Dark Souls & Sekiro including biomes inspirations, new enemies, mini-bosses & weapons. Also, lets overhaul the entire cosmetic systems, more variations & more customization options.
This is just normal gameplay when it’s you and a friend with a rando runs off alone
Please please see if you can do something about NAT matchmaking requirements? My ISP doesn't offer static IP options so my pre-ordered deluxe edition is just gathering dust. It hurts not to be part of the fun :(
This is great stuff, but please try to make this game cross-platform!
i just want an elden ring 2 bro
Duos are going to be great. Me and my friend can play without having a random running off on their own, dying, then leaving. People nowadays lack commitment, clearly shown when the person leaves
1 player or not interested.
We want the cross platform
FINALLY. It's insane this wasn't part of the game at launch, honestly. My friend and I played literally one mission at launch and despised being forced to play with a third player so we just stopped playing entirely. I guess now, a few months later, we might actually play the game.
Yeah sure... Coop now 2 months after release when everyone already finished and/or lost interest in this repetitive game
Next: Nightlord Boss Rush mode. Like if you want it. From software might just make it true.
Genial un modo que debió estar desde el lanzamiento del juego ha llegado
The fact they made a trailer for it is hilarious.
Great many friendships will be over soon after removing the one who can blame for losing
Holy dog (pope)
HUGE W.  Now we just need 4 Player.
Wylder x Duchess = Aura 🥶
??????????????
Good change honestly, there is no reason not to play duo on games like this... just hope the game balance things well.
This is coming conveniently on international friendship day
I wouldn't celebrate so quickly. In my experience, 3 PLAYERS IS BETTER. Why?  I've played with randoms since day 1, and apart from a few minor issues here and there, 80% of the time it's been satisfactory. When you're playing with 3, I can revive the fallen player while the third player attracts the aggro. Good luck doing that with just 2.  Good luck dealing with bosses that come in threes, especially if they're two weak characters that can easily been one-shot you (Revenant, Recluse). Good luck going with two weak ranged characters without a Wylder, Rider or even Duchess there in the middle with melee combat.  Don't celebrate duos too quickly, especially with the “Everdark Sovereign bosses.”  The enhanced Gaping Jaw for example, I must have done that run about 25 times, we only beat it 1 time, and I arrive there in level 15, with good random skill players, with legendary equipment, and nope, for one reason or another we fall, it's too easy for the creature to one-shot you just by blowing in your face, in a moment there's a lot of crap on screen, and I can't imagine trying to revive someone just by yourself, that is half or 3/4 death, with the boss at the same time on top of you, because there are no third player there.   Honestly, I think this duo thing is LAME, and I'll make the game even more difficult, but sure, let's celebrate.
What's the fun of having 2 chads disagree on which direction to go without the 1 simp to decide who to follow
what a concept
As a member of the Executors Union with 161 matches played with, we do not claim 0:35
Nooooo i want it to be solo
Everyone beat the game already though
hell yeah
Was it too hard to add this from the start?
封牢で鍵忘れる執行者笑った  改めて見ると円卓メンバーが仲良ししてるだけの映像でニッコリした
FUUUUUU****KKKKKK YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
why is the guardian riding the hawk? isnt he a hawk too? huh?
FInally adding something that should have been there since launch. Better than late than never I suppose Bandai Trashco.
How abou every playthrough gets a random shifting Earth.?
0:35 best part of this trailer😂😂
Why do you have to take the everdark bosses away? Why not leave them?
I’m ready to pay for more content. Please more bosses and map variations
We need an 8 player mode!
0:26 Recluse: Good boy~
Modders:'' Look what they need to mimic a fraction of our power''
Yippie, now I can play duo mode as solo.... T-T
Finally 💪
Can you guys bring back 6 player like dark souls 2 had
Come onnnn Bandai, show us that new tenchu game already
Duo’s will be horrible, purely a community service. Good luck reviving your mate with all aggro on you, this game was designed for 3s and people gonna find that out soon lol
Split screen please Fromsoftware 🥺🥺
Nice!
next give us 4 player co-op
add it now lazy bastards
That’s cool! can you add more cosmetics next?
Pls give us more drip to grind for we will gladly pay
Nightreign 2-player mode: Finally, someone to die with instead of alone.
a whole trailer for two player mode ts was unnecessary
Wow. The thing that should have easily been in the game already is finally there in the game. We needed a trailer for this. Yup.
石剣のくだりとか、追跡者+レディのペアとかセンス良すぎ
Would I be able to game share on PS5?
Okay, so when will we see someone using four limbs to complete a 2-player expedition?
I’m sooo excited, I seriously can’t wait🩷
so.. basically the average experience when a noob rage quits?
Finally, me and the wife have been waiting for months
Chat Duo mode is real
Damn the team that makes the trailer really having fun huh, i know from the bring me to life triler that team is special
We actually doing yellow damage regularly now boys 😎
Finally i can play with my pookie
they really made a whole ahh trailer for removing 1 player from the party😭🙏
This is exciting news for sure, but did it need a trailer? Lol. Nothing looked new other than a 2 player lobby. I wonder how they are going to balance this. For example will Wending Graces be more common to find/purchase since there's less potential for a teammate to revive in a duo lobby vs trio?
Incredible, this is so cool!!! Now my wife and I can play together without a third wheel.  Split screen when
NO LONGER!!! NO LONGER SHALL WE HAVE A QUITTER, YOU CAN STAY QUITTING, WE WHO STAND EVEN THROUGH THE DARKEST OF NIGHTS SHALL PREVAIL!!!   But really this is a win for us 2 players that deal with big headed people that run off because they have probably the worst sense of direction but wanna play leader, gets downed and leaves.
Now 4 player mode!😂
Bold of bandai to think that I have a friend.
Maskless Duchess garb? 0:45
Great, now make the four player mode that everyone actually wants
I have a few friends in the Steam group but we're an odd number, so there's often one person who can't join some teams. This solves that, and the relic update looks great. Keep polishing the game, it's been a lot of fun!
This gave me chills… in the best way
Love it
Took you long enough, my gosh..
YES. THANK YOU
Remove the fortnite circle
Now where's Cross-platform at?
You guys better protect your midges
Okay but we need a Wylder face reveal. FromSoft please hurry.
You're all really hyped over something that should've already been in the game 😂😂
Present 8 Hours
Im not playing in duo its boring
They have the siblings working together 🥺
C R O S S   P L A Y    W H E N
Cross platform update next? 🥺
friendslop
I'm running out of people to blame for losing.
This is what I’ve been waiting for. I have a trio- but one hommie be sleeping when the night comes, and it’s just easier to get one other hommie to play.
Local co-op?
I need to get back into this game 😅
took them 2 months to do something modders did literally within 24 hours of release
Wouldn’t it be awesome if the first and second night boss is a group of 3 or 2 invaders depending on how many of a team you got? Wouldn’t that be badass? I know they can come up with something good!
We want Elden Ring 2. Stop this multiplayer thing anymore...
More Libra, please!
Split screen please
This is all I wanted from Day 1, thank you so much 👌 😘
Would be really good if this feature were added in regular Elden Ring too.
Bro take forever with this why dont they.. my friends already stopped playing
4 players next please i have too many friends
0:39 Reminds me of a game called The Pathless where you grab the legs of a bird who helps you fly/glide. Everyone should play that game it's made by some of the same developers as Journey.
yay! we get a feature that should have shipped with the base game
I’m so pumped for this!!!!
Too late
Holy sh1t finally.
Still unable to play the game on Xbox One. Network issue prevents me from playing online since launch. Badly coded unfortunately.
Perfect
It's almost impossible with 3 players! How the f*ck are 2 supposed to kill the Night Lords?
Too late already finished the game. Thanks for nothing buttcheeks
imagine creating a trailer just for a duo game mode. Maybe some new bosses or unlockables????? new missions?
Thank God. Asking a Stanger to be decent at this game has been way too godamn much to ask
Hey random duo😙
Super nightfarers bros
They see what we want and give it to us!!!! 🙏🙏🙏
0:36 " First fort didn't give you any stonesword key but you were sure it did. "
...why is there a trailer for this?
now i want a trailer for every patch note
Mohg: DUO!!!!
Congratulations to the multi-million dollar company for adding a basic feature that should’ve been in the game at the start
Honestly wasn't even needed and then y'all just gonna rage more when you get clapped for having two people instead of 3, pointless.  I like the engagement Fromsoft but stop catering to the bs the game really needed more characters, time wasted bruh
On one hand I'm glad solo and duo runs are available, that's always a good feature for multiplayer.  On the other hand, it's a little bit sad that the lore and the artistic vision for the game had to be compromised. The trio motif is everywhere in Elden Ring and in Nightreign, and that's really cool.
Be nice if the game wasn’t dead already lol beat it completely in 2 weeks if only there was a tiny bit more randomization in the map then it would be actually a good game
Awesome! Can I get Bloodborne 2 now please 🙏
0:25 I fuckin' wish Iron Eyes would be that helpful
Finally. So tired of that one random player who runs off, makes a bunch of terrible decisions that puts you and your buddy's entire run at risk, dies, then quits and WE get a damn penalty for wanting to leave after they left first. Terrible.  Let's get some performance improvements next please.
"See, there's two! Not one or three, but *two* players!"
Pog
Yeah and now me and my buddy dont have to suffer a random 3rd
Cool, now let us play everdark bosses solo/offline, I don't want to pay PS+ just for that 😒
2 months for something a modder in 1 week managed to accomplish😂  Japan Triple A games are slow as hell to get updates out, i've already played 130 hours and there's no more content  WAKE UP FROM SOFT!
Sweetness.
Thank God I won't have to deal with the moronic players who queue solo, idk why but 75% of the randoms on PS5 seem like they've never held a controller before
i played a lot duo. cuz always one of our teammates quit. Maybe network problem or they just wanna give up.  btw i reached 300+hours on nightreign. i need to touch grass fr.
Doesnt change anything for me, I rather play with more ppl instead, but im Glad they are listening what ppl are asking for 🎉 🎉
Solo mode if you’re with a guardian
I love trios but there's something more intimate about duos  I mean that in the most PG way
Huge Hype
thank u guys
Seriously, how did it even cross your mind that a three-player-only game was a clever concept?
Although I do think this should have been a feature since launch, I do want to credit FromSoft for actually listening to the huge amount of player requests for this feature
Now we need a trailer for cross-platform capability
Niw make 10 player mode, just for the chaos
I haven't gotten on board with this game yet but how was there not a 2 player mode at launch lol
So lazy
So awesome! I wasn’t expecting an entire trailer for it   4player - 8player next?
They need to add quads as well.  It would be great if they could bump all the way up to the Colosseum 6 player mode though.
Any possible chance of adding more skins to the heroes, cause their is a whole lot of roster yall have to choose to bring into the game
We really don't need a trailer for ts 💀
4 player mode and 2 night bosses at the same time when :P
They actually listened to everyone
Finally, more relic filters! (they say it in the description)
Siiiiiiiiiooooo
Let's Gooooo!!! I'm one step closer to having a full team of friends... Now to find a friend
ずっと待ってた！！！ユーモアたっぷりなの笑ったｗ　ペアのセンスがまた素晴らしい
Finally, 5 days away Let’s Go!
I think we should have 7 players that would be a party 🎉😂
two is cool, but three’s company 🤘
Yes!
Finally
big ass trailer for a feature that was already a thing random leaves = my friend and i ends up playing normally and win just 2 of us
W Fromsoftware as always ❤
Me and my brother we are 2 souls vet and also platinum this one solo now we cam team up me raider and him ironeye to run the ones with the nightlords
The friendless update is here! Finally we have FRIEND!
let's fucking go!
Will my inputs be more responsive hopefully
Hooray, if only any of my friends actually played this...
素晴らしいプレゼントです!!!!!　小ネタが聞いてて動画も面白い☺せかす復讐者ちゃんにうっかり執行者…
You guys need to introduce far more interesting & varied rewards & soon.   Most of us that bought the game on release have cleared out both shops in the first few weeks, done all the bosses & got no reason to actually play other than for the randomness.
I was expecting 4 or 5 players mode 😢
Thank you!! Finally 🎉
To all the people  quit whining and get good, it's only your fault for even going to multiplayer to begin with 🙄
I know this would be tough to implement but is there a way to get a mode without time restrictions so you can free roam... like Remnant 2 but with Elden Ring?
you could simply add a patch note... but you have to do it always in an spectacular way... :)
When do we get 4 players?
It’s about time, thank you!
Now you have something new to complain about cause if your partner get knocked down it’s just you now y’all go learn 😄
No more 3rd wheeling, couples can blame themselves now
When four player?
July 30th night reign officially launches for me. Can't effing wait.
Everyone knows you don’t have time for emotes until the end of the run
Its time to call my sunbro for a JOLLY COOPERATION 🗿🗡️
This trailer is like its an expansion and not just a basic feature...
Please add in more weapons like some from the souls series please 🙏 Sir Alonne Executor, Blue Smelter demon Raider, Anri of Astora Wylder, lady Friede Duchess, Gough for Ironeye or Chester, pyromancer from ds2 for Spell Girl (forgot her name lol), dusk for revenent
Where's my flock at???!?! 🦅
People asked for this?
Seems cool but this makes a character like Guardian much less interesting. But man FINALLY. Rly wonder how it's balanced.
I like that they added this 2 months late. No sarcasm, I think 3 players is optimal and I'm happy they forced everybody to play like that or try solo.
lmao do we really need a trailer for this basic ahh feature? how about you rebalance some character's kits? Ironeye is braindead easy and op. Executor is decent but only if you completely ignore his active skill, just use his good scaling and just use his ult to heal, lame af
Greetings, nightfarers. Woeful plight for these nights, thou are MAIDENLESS！
There was part of me that was hoping they meant local two-player. That would've actually gotten me to pick this up. C'est la vie.
If they drop a new Nightfarer I’ll lose my mind to madness, which is a good thing
CONGRATULATIONS! An entire month to add a simple feature that seamless co op did before. Hard work as its finest!
I looooove the “wait what? I don’t have a key either!”
if the scaling is identical to the seamless co op mod 2 players will be the best way to play this game
i wish my body let me play this game more..... its so good!
When does this update drop
待ってました！
So epic thanks
Quick question: why wasn't this in the game straight out of the box?
Te quiero mucho fromtsofware pero no mams como haces un trailer de algo que tenía que venir desde el día 1
Finally🔥🔥🔥
So happy for this
Please do not add voice chat.
I have 0 friends
❤
We got duos before the epstein list
I really love Elden ring, I played crack version but with crack I can't play the Nightriegn, it cost me 40$, that's a lot for an employment to afford.😢
Please support this game on the long run I beg you
This will be epic but when you do 2 player and you screw up you really do need that third person to help sometimes.
0:32 Revenant: Hurry and open it up Executor: Chill, I got it. Lemme just- Huh? ***Stonesword Key Required***
Seeing this trailer makes me wish there was a faster way to go through emotes.  Ds1 and 2 were super easy. To many menus to go through now it takes to long.
Why does there need to be a trailer for this like that's so dumb lol. Just put it out already
Kindly add more ability/effect combinations like with your typical roguelike game. Cheers!
FINALLY now the only wait is for tarnished edition and dlc for nightreign :)
this should been from the begining but better late than never
In single player, can you add AI to help you in your quest. Like how they do with followers from Monster Hunter Rise
СДЕЛАЙТЕ КТО-НИБУДЬ TAKE ON ME NITGHTREIGN!!!!!!!!!!
Hell Yes! DUOS finally!
I was always able to play duos with my frined
Its gonna be a Wyld expidition
0:35 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHa
あー最高！！！ 最高！！！
awesome
LETS GOOOO
Cool! Now please add more content LOL
Bird feet😊😂
Now I can play with just one imaginary friend!
Yes!! Thank you so much for listening to the community, I am so excited for this!  Please give us a better sorting/filtering system for the relics. After playing so much it is becoming quite a nightmare to deal with all the relics, also an option to sell/favorite any relics on the spot after an expedition would be fantastic!
fastest queue of all ahh game
Now waiting for the 4 and 5 players update
Split screen?🥲
Thank you Fromsoft for listening.
this could have been an email
不要給荒野帶節奏 😂
finally i can know for sure who carried me
Will the bosses scale accordingly ?
Finally!!!!!!
Great trailer
wow so slow bro mod can do day1
Finally, i can dissapoint just one other person instead
Crossplatform please!
CROSSPLATFORM TRAILER WHEN
Slowly turning into a battle royale. All we need is solos and squads
The hardest boss in nightreign... finding friends
There goes my days of trolling random duos 😂😂😂 was fun while it lasted.
Now add a 4 player option
Makes bad mutiplayer game. Begins taking mutiplayer out of it. Ffs. Add a mic or better map pings. And idk maybe actually properly translate the buffs and debuffs. What a fiasco.
Thank you for the duo mode Fromsoftware. Now it's time for crossplay. Greeting from Lima Peru.
アプデ頻度が多くて嬉しい
Yes, it should have been already in the game, but let's take a moment of appeciation of them actually addressing player feedback, which is a rarety nowadays. I wish besides new bosses, the mobs around the world to shift as well in future patches. That would keep the game fresh. Thank you Fromsoft!
Damn, now me and my friend won't be able to blame the random third player for our screw-ups💀
ah man finaly
Elden Ring Nightreign content and other souls like games in the channel sub up
LETS GOOO
Add chalice dungeon raids
The only unrealistic part is the Executor not having the evergaol meta relic.
Bandai please fix the audio issue and performance issues on Xbox one
FINALLY FROMSOFT ❤❤
Ohh look at these two
Ppl want duo since release and now they make an trailer with a fixed date like its a big thing. Fromsoft is laughing at us at this point
Slandering the Evergaol Meta lmao😂😂
Fucking finally; now add a four-player mode
Finally
Cool we get a big reveal to the same mode I play when a noob rage quits lmao
But everdark Fulghor is gone for a long while, why show him at the end?
ADD MORE MAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPSS!!!
I miss everdark fulghor 😔
0:38 after showing duos of guardian and raider, we need smough and orstein skin ASAP 😂😂😂
New characters when?
And why didn't they add this feature from the start? Why add it now? It just goes to show how little quality mattered to them when releasing the game. Once again, it's proven that Nightreign is easily Fromsoftware's worst game. Even Dark Souls 2 is made with more love than this $40 rip-off.
So one less teammate means only 2 max revive bars right? FromSoft? Right… Fromsoft?
Executor showing up to an evergaol without a key has me reeling.
On the 30th? Perfect timing, just before the new Everdark Sovereign
0:35 is peak humor
sensazionale
TOGETHAAA!
Tks!
It took a month to kill all the bosses in the duo, when we do it, they make it easier lol
FINALLY
Is sad this is a update feature that should had been there from day 1
Love this!   I hope y’all bring nightreign over to switch 2.
This is actually crazy they made a trailer for this, it really shows they were like y'all asked for it here it is.
Ohhh lovely me and my misses will enjoy this
About damn time
Finaly
It's the same game but now with LESS Players! (Should have been available on launch)
People have been doing this due to players leaving early, mid, or late in the game, but now it is official.
Immagine making a whole ass trailer for coop
Awesome news. Just a proof these guys care about their players/community. Haters and cry babies will be still here thats never gonna change, but its great to see devs been cooking.
Great news! Now we need cross-platform also
My true mentor, she is always there all along
I have a friend that lost interest in the game after the first boss so its been me and another friend always having to play with randos (Not that thats a bad thing but its inconvenient)
Faster than I expected!
Lol love the use of emotes
FINALLY
Fromsoft makes a trailer to hype people up for an awaited feature. Some comments here: Waaaa this didn't need a trailer 🤡  There's no winning with some people I swear!
Friendless?
Yes duet paper squishy guardian and raider
“You’re as beautiful as the day I lost you”
Relic Filtering!! Lets goooo
NOW we're talking!! Game is about to take off for real.
Finally! 🥳🥳🥳🥳
IM THE ELDEN LORD
You're selling something that should have been there in the first place.  This company is rotten...
21:9 mode when?
THANK YOU! now I want 4 player mode  :)
Thank you
Awesome, now do ultra wide support so I don’t have 6 inch black bars on both sides of my monitor!
Finally my friend and I can play this game.
Just finished up my platinum trophy but I'll be around for the Everdark Sovereigns and new content.
lecker
peak gaming
Thank you for such a cute trailer, and the mode!
LETS GOOO
Wow Fulghor theme AND clips from his fight just as you took him from me?! This hit me right in the feelings....I miss you pony man. Please come back soon!
Used to dream about such a future
0:08 raider and ironeye raising fists is how i wanted raider's quest to end, thank you bandai, thank you fromsoft 0:34 executor loses some aura
Praise the sun
0:35 The Executor not having a key LMAOOOO
ULTRAWIDE SUPPORT AND I WILL BUY IT
2 player mode without couch co-op is mean :((
How about multiplat for gameplay and mic
You needed a trailer for such a normal thing?
So, no new content?
Finally
Online or on the same console
What bout Ultrawide?!?!
遂に来るのか
Finally!
0:32 the scene here of Revenant calling Executor over to use the stonesword key, and Executor reaching into their pocket and does the confused gesture because they don't have one is so funny to me XD
Now all we need is crossplatform and our lives will be complete
finally
Awesome! Now we need Quads!
Yeah finally 🎉
0:45 Bro and sis aurafarming, just as they were always meant to be.
Very AWESOME 😮
❤❤❤
My buddy is about to find out why Nightreign has no built in voice chat.
HELL YEAH!
Fulghor ost 🗿✨️
Add more Dark Souls bosses as field bosses and also other FS games enemies roaming around 😭 I almost forget this has crossover
I like the pairings they used. Wylder and Duchess, Revenant and Executor, Ironeye and Raider, Recluse and Guardian. Each of these makes the most sense I think.
Finally
That's funny they market Revenant and Executor together. They're the two I played the most
Local?
Nice
THANK YOU!
DUO MODE FINALLY!!!
A trailer for this is CRAZY 😭
Cool now add a 2 player mode to elden ring
Is time for DU-DU-DU-DUAL
Well needed solo is doable but playing duo and with 1 random is a pain some times
Didn’t really need a trailer for it though unless it brought a new mechanic, just shows us what we already do and know already
FINALLY!!!
One friend required? Too much of an ask imo
WWW 🎉
NO WAY 0:33 HES AURA FARMING
Offline?
ADD OILED UP RAIDER
game chat when
FINALLY DUOS
That's cool Now add an option to marry recluse.
I love that they decided to use Wylder and Duchess for this, 😢 the two siblings 🍞
Why duels
LETS GOOO
DUO MODE !!!!
Oh welp finally
Finally, my girlfriend and I can play this game! Now, I just need to find one 🤕
HELL YEAH SON, THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!!
Guardian and Recluse is my favorite pairing
Jolly cooperation
Finally me and buds were getting tired of randoms who kept being dumb in runs
52sec is crazy
Here we go boys
FINALLY 🎉🎉🎉
