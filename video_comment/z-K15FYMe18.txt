And yet cr7 didnt w had the same treatment, shame
Bye2 kroos 👑legend 8
When I need a good cry. I come watch this video.
All of our legends deserve a farewell like this ....but only a few are lucky
I think just have plan to retire as a madridista. This guy is gonna have an investment property near real madrid grounds.
adios toni kross
He will change his mind and continue playing. Mark my word
Once called a Bayern Reject, now capable of standing shoulder to shoulder woth the greatest midfielders of all time. What a career  6 UCL Total 3 Peat of UCL 1Treble 1 WC 95% Accuracy in almost every season
Carlo Ancelotti brought Toni Kroos in 2014 from Bayern Munich and he was also the one who let him go now
Toni Kroos das war Famos! beim weltbesten Club Real zum besten deutschen Spieler der Geschichte aufgestiegen.Hoen.u.Rumme.heulen in München mit.
😮😮😅😊😢❤❤❤
The camera man is a racist,camavinga's turn to hug Toni,he removed it
One of the most respecful player by all football fans. (Barcelona supporter)
My respect for Toni Kroos. Gracias
❤
Here I look at Tony Cross, a great footballer in his style, and when he ends his career there are so many tears, I can’t imagine when Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, end his career, what the fans will be like!
Is Toni Kroos playing finale fame Champions League ?
Thanks Legenda 👍
Тони ты супер и будешь навсегда
World shoak farewell Good by legend toni kroos what amazing player 😢😢😢😢😢
TONI 🤍🤍🤍🙏🙏🙏
A máfia da Fifa deveria servir para atribuir 1 prêmio a este GRANDE jogador...neste caso sem máfia...merecido!
Que prazer enorme ver o Toni jogar....Que prazer. Que classe!! All the best mi hermano!!...
One of the best Mitfilder of all Time, a Legend ❤
Have a feeling Wirtz will end up being his replacement.
🙋🙋🙋
One of the GREATEST.......Thank you Toni for the unforgettable moments
One of the Greatest sniper in football history
Toni Kroos the best value signing in Madrid History. Retired for the love of his family. #Respect
Not gonna lie, i shed a tear.
Today a pound is closed for or another. A story ended and I was there reading this book later I could tell my children that I was following this incredible story
look at velverde his cry 😢
THANK YOU TONI KROOS
We love KR8S ❤
Thank you Toni
His Silent Killer 😂
Im not crying you are 🥺
Nobody realized the importance of  Toni Kroos before his retirement
Always miss you Tony Kross 8 ❤️
Wait is he not playing the UCL FINAL? 😢
Respect
Big enough to make a grown man cry
Почему 😢😢😢😢
Top tier midfielder,one of the very best of this generation.
Thank you toni kroos 😢😢😢
For me the last 10 years this guy has been my favorite footballer. Absolutely a class player and easily a top 5 midfielder since 2014. Most importantly a very humble and class human being off the field with doing so much charity work. What also symbolizes his classiness is even wearing a pair of adidas 11pro 2 football boots that adidas had to give in and make multiple fresh pairs of the same boots for him annually. Something not even Ronaldo or Messi got.
I miss you Toni Kroos 😭😭😭😭
Finally we never see toni kross again😢😢
Man Utd fan here. Kroos has been consistently one of the top 5 midfielders in the world over the last 10 years. Unbelievable midfielder 👏🏼.
Legend❤️❤️
Gracious Toni 🎉
another legend retires
Ancelotti is really like their dad
Even Isco is there
Danke Kr8s
Man seeing daughter cry made me cry 😢
im just hoping he wore his iconic boots
2014-2017 Barca and RM starting line up is coming to an end 😢 Modric, Ter Stegan, Carvejal all thats left
Wish Ronaldo had a farewell in bernabeu
Would've been amazing if other club legends like Casillas, cr7, Ramos, Benzema got the same farewell from the Bernabeu crowd
💔😭
So kroos isn't going to play the champions league final?
Viendo este video semesaltan las lágrimas
Kroos, Siempre en nuestros corazonoes. Legend❤
Antonio Kroos es Español ❤
Liat anaknya nangis, jadi ikutan sedih 😭. Terimakasih Legenda
5 hampions league medals, world cup medal, multiple la liga medals .... One of the all time greats
😢😢😢😢😢
Football is crying as one of his best is almost retired. Danke Herr Kroos, ich liebe dich!
Самый эмоциональный момент , я так не плакал , когда прощался Роналдо ! Спасибо тебе Тони за твою игру , с любовью из России 🇷🇺
Leave the dark side and return to legal sport away from the Real Madrid mafia
Possibly the best #8 in the history of Madrid
LEGEND
Plot twist: Kroos decided to retire right there so he could waste time since it was 0-0 and madrid needed time to score.
Toni Kroos kenapa harus pensiun sih 😭😭😭😭 Pengen lihat Kroos di Madrid
Gracias Kroos! 8
Leyenda y mucho más. Gracias Toni por existir. Ejemplo a seguir. Muchas gracias por los ratos de futbol ofrecidos. Te queremos. De un culé.
HE IS SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!🌠🏆⚽
muchas gracias kroos ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
8 000 people attended Kroos' presentation in 2014. Ten years later Kroos is a Real Madrid legend and 80 000 people gave him the best farewell imaginable.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The only person wearing same boots for the lasts few decades
Salute to our German king kroos
Thank you legend 👏🏼

As he arrived in Madrid he was Toni Kroos, after 10 Years he is now Antonio Cruz.
TK8 ❤ LEGEND !
Being a Barça fan yet this makes me shed tears. One of the best the game has ever had. Love Toni Kroos ❤
No way. I'm so sad bro😢
RIP Toni
Isco was there❤❤❤❤
I’m crying
This UCL with either be for Reus or for Kroos
2:38 I understand why Toni's little daughter is crying. When his dad signed for Real, she was just a baby. She's been in Madrid all her short life and now she knows it has come to an end. Her dad has faced the final curtain. Very emotional.
You arrived with less people in the stadium but u left with full house attendance. Respect the legend 🫵🏻🙌🏻
Still early for goodbyes, we still have the cl to win in Wembley 🙂
Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Master♥️👍💯kroos
This means Toni will not win ucl
I'm Barca fans , but i love Tony Kross
Berita kemenangan MU tertutupi oleh berita pensiunnya Kross
Hahaha Real Madrid 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jawohl Bettis 😊👍⚽️
Kross es top 5 mediocentros q han jugado para el Madrid , hoy se va una leyenda 😢
he got the moment, the best farewell for real madrid player ever, better than zidane,casillas,raul,cr7,ramos thank you toni

The most famous German player leaves the newly designed stadium by the most famous German architects….More isn’t possible and it will never happen again!

Legend Toni 8 RMC❤
feel sorry for nacho, it was his last game too
Kroos tampak menahan tangis saat berpelukan dengan rekan2 nya. Dan nampak mencurahkan tangisnya di saat dia datang dan memeluk putrinya. Pure Class !!!. Legend. Football is not always about win or lose. Football is about love and family. Yeaah, we are family
No one was there for his presentation, but the entire bernabeu and spain paid their respects on his final day Denke Toni👏👏
I can’t even put a damn comment on this which makes sense. I am so emotional. Will miss you legend. Forever in our hearts. Hala Madrid.
His kids are so cute
Best midfielder of all time alongside zidane and Modric
We will remember you forever.
King assist TONI KROOS

His daughter reaction make me cry!😭
Tahun ini semoga toni kroos memenangkan penghargaan Ballon D'or 🥲🥲
We will miss you. Toni. Uno de nosotros❤

Not a Madrid nor Kroos fan, but this dude is one of the best midfielders ever born. 10 years in a club as big as Real Madrid ain't joke. Enjoy your retirement Toni.. 👏
Seeing his kids cry set me off aswell 😭🥺🤍
You cut the best moment with the kids
I can't stop crying🥺. Legends left us one by one. Who will we watc?💔

It was so Heart warming when that kid was holding a "Ref please dont blow the final witsel or Kroos will leave us" and now he will never play at the Bernabeu again😭 He was one of my midfield idols alongside Luka Modric😢 hopefully you live a happy life after the Euros
Being a barcelona fan I can't hate Kroos and Modric in general ❤️ They're Love 💗
Damn, not even Casillas had this farewell… 😳😳
