Lads you can’t really compete with Harry is just embarrassing,  Harry will always be invincible  So off your pop
Harry losing ruined my life
The last 3 minutes were litteraly exceptional. Perfect.
top class
31:05 fucking hell, that was me. I got embarrassed, gg shawrey
Anyone know if we get a vid this week?
We can’t hear them on floor 2 anymore😂😭
I love these videos! But Shawrey needs to stop shouting in such a high pitched voice all of a sudden 😭🤣
Rigged, Harry can't lose
Were is the rewards?
Theodore tom bagwell
I can hear him crying on the floor. Harrys invincible streaks no more! GC won a pen shootout. F Off Harry You're a loser now!
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened
This is the best, and I mean THE BEST video on YouTube boys you are unreal. A pleasure for this content to be free 😂😂 so so good ❤️
it took the efforts of two professional players along with errors from PGMOL to bring harry down; class...
R.I.P :(
Does this mean GC is Brock Lesnar? Can see the resemblance tbf
As I fellow Evertonian surely Harry should of known better than to celebrate to early 😂
That man is a natural born actor!    I mean Shawrey
Oh my god that man is hilarious. I really hope we get to see him again.  The best hashtag house week BY FAR. Good job guys
Zombie King meeting Patrick was top tier. Great stuff
I think they missed the boat by Shawrey Tom and GC not dressing up as Brock Lesnar for this episode !!! World have been class
I got a good forfeit idea  U have to use Antony day’s tactics and formation 😂
39:15 such a good moment some of the hardest ive laughed at this channel
At the very end you should have had Harry sit up in the coffin as the Undertakers gong sounds.
The beast George Collins!!!
Harry crying to shawrey about not distracting him during the game but he's there singing behind Tom
Need Shawrey dressed as Paul Heyman with Tom wearing a "Eat, Sleep, Break the Streak" vest next video
shawreys costume is elite
I’ve never seen people so bad at apple bobbing 😂😂
Shawrey was robbed in the pumpkin challenge
So much chaos man
You guys should have a trophy that the winner of the month gets for that month, think it would be fun to have something to unseriously compete for
shawrey cheats to win the month from now on he should not cry if others cheat
The streak lives on. Haha tom and shawrey
It had to be harry wearing as the undertaker when he lost the month :(( . Great vid lads love the vids !! :))
Gc that’s not good enough almost sold the end of the streak
This is genuinely the greatest episode of all time, from beginning to end! Faced all emotions, shed tears of happiness, sadness and joy
just finished the vid might be on of your best ever i think. (the deadman will rise again rip)
That guest was just noisy and boring. Had to skip almost the entire video
Gc always favors Harry
Why were Shawreys opponents so bad compared to Harry and Tom?
Did tom take harry player for the green at the end or am i missing something?
Shawrey, 0 chem used to get rid of stats. now it just gives no bonuses thats why its easier.
New wheel addition, a player that the other guys choose gets replaced by a bronze card
Unreal video man😂😂😂😂
Shawrey actually got robbed in both challenges, pgmol conspiracy continues
Fuck I hate Shawrey
Why didnt tom get to swap a player before the last game ? He shouldve had moore for the last game wouldve made a big difference considering he had a cb out of position
The fact that they are celebrating harry losing this month for like the first time in years, shows the levels on how good harry is. Learn your place
Toms pumkin has fully sent me😂
Is tom good at anything on this planet over then fifa? 😂 hopeless are the challenges this week
Shawrey looks just like the blackburn cb Hayden carter
Pure cinema
Did tom never take a player for the second green?
I fucking love these blokes man
Streak ends but will start again next month , cmon H!
Forever a shawry fan now. YOU RAMS 🐏🐏
so cool to have Toms Dad in the video
That ending 😂😂😂😂😂
Does anybody know the name of the song Shawrey and Tom were dancing to in a past video... Vivo a la player something something....a past FC Song
“Shawrey” losing the streak is prime cinema 😂 (yes I know it’s Harry) great vid lads
Omgg that was amazing
this is hilarious 😂😂😂
It actually was the last game because you’ve got 39-7 which is 46 so he was actually 38-6 before last game Harry won making him 38-7 after his last game so if Tom lost he would of went from 38-6 to 38-7 making him equal then would of been pen shootout so Harry did only lose the streak after gc won pens
How did ye get juan mata to dress like that
been a fascinating watch to see GC favour the end of the streak more and more as the episodes went on!
It’s over, what a day for floor two 🤣  The invincible will never be repeated!
Zombie king bloke reminds me of the news presenter off of horrible histories
Best video this year by far. The streak beaten as Harry is dressed as Taker, as well as it being Shawrey winning it, given how poor he was in the last FC game. Fantastic work.
Wait but Tom n Harry had the same amount of losses so how has Tom won
Top 3 videos on the channel. The wheel spins were half shite tho
GC cost H this month big time😭😭😭
The underwear taker is death 😭😭😭🤣
harry did the 67 motion
I don’t think the streak should be “over” when it was a short game week… I just can’t allow it🤣😭
After game 14 did Tom not get to steal a player?
Best uk show since top gear
I actually feel Tom’s level of frustration at GC’s wrong coin flip call, he needs reparations
no one took blackmon who is a 90 pace cb, sould gave paired him with sabbi a rm with 93 pace.
Classic
thought that was spencer for a second lmao
I could’ve sworn Tom was meant to steal one of Harry’s players before their last game loooooool
W content. Fan from Mongolia
pathethic that they were all against harry all video, and celebrated cause they know harry's is miles better than both combined
Cant believe they had to change the format to a 3 week month just for them to end the streak, streets will never forget the 19 months are glroy 😢❤️
Sorry GC but Shawrey's pumpkin was way better than Harry's or whatever Tom's tried to do
can’t be the only who thought he was jarring the whole video ffs
Harry being called shawry for couple of games made him lose the month the shwary effect is real people
This was peak fifa lads in the most brilliant autistic way possible. RIP the invincible, will never be done again
The streak…     Is over
Surely someone needs to look into Shawrey using a div 8 account to play his champs 😂
can’t believe no one picked gabriel silva  74 rated silver w 96 pace and quick step+
GC this was the ultimate betrayal
The amount of love I have for these videos every Sunday
what an episode!
Harry was extremely funny this video, big up h❤
I wish tom and shawrey walked off at the end and harry sat up like the undertaker does in the ring....would of been class
and he did it without even swapping a player from the green wheel spin!!
if there is 1 video to watch this week its this one!!! absolutely outstanding!! I havent played Fifa/FC games in years but these are just pure entertainment!
Harry didn’t get his icon n Tom didn’t take a player
Easily the best one I’ve watched so far 😂😂 in stitches
WTF was Tom's pumpkin LMFAOOOOO
15:28 he was actually a hilarious addition to this video 😂
Noooooooooo Harry
first hh vid i stopped watching cuz the cringy pedo walking around the house acting like hes at a 4 year old birthday party
that guy ruined it ngl
Nah Ngl Shawrey’s pumpkin is way better. That’s rigged
a hashtag house classic, never ever dissapoints  watching from Turkiye love your content guys
Great video and great ending. GC taking down the undertaker 😂
Can we get the Guinness records involved? Toms pumpkin has to be the worst pumpkin ever carved 🤣
Can we have a rivals week where you make a past and present from your rival club?
Been looking for harry for 2 months now, this is where u are . Nice content tho
1:04:36 no ur not mate did this last week unlucky
Technically harry didn’t loose. It was the undertaker playing not him.
How you haven’t had Harry do the undertaker out of the coffin is a missed trick
Not watching anymore now the streaks over. Hope you're happy
The year is 2036. “I can hear them crying on floor 2, the invincible wins for me and you” chants Harry Hesketh as he takes it to an 11 year undefeated streak on Pro FIFA Evo FC.
Might be the greatest moment in Hashtag House history at the end
Something insanely unsettling about that ending 😭
Absolute cinema
its finally over
Outrageous that Tom and Harry full sent costumes and Shawrey just painted his face, not even a wig or anything.. oh wait that’s not his real hair. Never mind
I'm only 8 minutes in and I am howling with what that guy is coming out with... "Fellerer, is that the tennis player??" that did me in!
Harry looking more like bruce bogtrotter than the undertaker 🤣🤣
Greatest HH content ever.
Pgmol shafted Pgmol booooo
Didn’t think wes would spawn in and scare everyone
wow what an episode
The comments on this video are just as good as the video itself😂
Toms pumpkin looked better once he smashed it 😂
Outstanding Content George....Shouldve put Cascade on fire in the end just saying
Gc gave him every chance to not lose🤣
Nah Shawrey got robbed on the pumpkin challenge
New idea for the wheel: Mini map only - pretty self explanatory the whole screen is covered apart from the little mini map at the bottom
Toms opponent to end the streak might be the worst player ive ever seen
54:09 🤣🤣🤣
Amazing
Shawrey d riding Tom 😂😂😂
The C in GC stands for CLUTCH! 🔥 R.I.P Underweartaker. 💀
what a weasel shawrey is begging tom not to take his player
I never ever leave comments on videos but I had to here. This video was absolute cinema… proper proper entertaining 🤣🤣
47:11 so it's not a punishment if the players are in position?
Nah the difference between shawrey and toms matchmaking is insane
Absolute cinema! Dressing up as the Undertaker, losing the streak right at the end, WWE belt in the coffin, absolutely iconic moment that’ll go down in YouTube history. Love it lads👏👏👏
The production quality is through the roof! Epic video lads, got me through the afternoon at work 👌
The end, the end make sense of that. Where on earth are we now? A night of dismay, a night of hope lost and restored, a night of salvation, a night of despair and elation, a night of such raw emotion. And at the end of it all, curiously, we are where we started.
was waiting for the next vid theme announced and a bong and harry rising from the coffin! Come on GC!!
What a video! Between the zombie king and Shawrey doing the Undertaker theme tune on the trumpet! The streak is over
That player Tom played in his last game is possibly the worst player I have ever seen on these vids
This may be the most GOATED fifa channel ever. Just get Anthony Day on and it’ll be elite
This is the saddest moment in Hashtag House history, the streak will forever be remembered
Might sound stupid , you should do a livestream decides our team and stream all the games on each channell , i undetstand its youtube but its a one off idea.
Great performance from David Harbour as the Zombie King
The best episode ever!!
So GC is Brock Lesnar?
this was brilliant!! really appreciate the extra effort that goes into making it a big themed episode, doesn't go unnoticed by the viewers!!
The Harry bias from GC …
w video banger house hashtag ❤️💙🤍🖤💛
That ending had me howling 😂 shawreys rendition on the invisible sax made it hilarious.  Top content lads 🫶🏻👏
Shawreys makeup is honestly incredible lmao. Lowkey spooking me out just looking at it
Rest in peace invincible o7
absolute cinema.
Tom forgot to swap a player for a green wheel spin at the end of the video
GC DOESNT EVEN TRY HIDE HIS BIAS FOR HARRY IN CHALLENGES
btw Tom u pronounce Rio's name N-GA-MO-A
Shawrey literally copy paste his team with which he tried to go 15-0 😭😭😭
GC IS BROCK LESNAR
GC out here moving like brock lesnar, zombie king guy was class too. This might be the best video you guys have done 😊
Really sad to see Shawrey not make an effort with his costume when everyone else did
CHEAT CHEAT CHEAT CHEAT!
His name is Shawrey He comes from Derby He broke the streak, broke the streak After 19 months  His name is Shawrey He comes from Derby And he plays for Hashtag House
Harry absolutely deserved to lose that month. Shocking decisions from GC this week
0:50 hands down been my best defender all game😭. YOU RAMS
Is it not worth the wheel spins being tested before the shoot if they aren’t already?
why did i think it was lewissaunderson in the start😭
hashtag house the only Fifa content worth watching
JUSTICE FOR HARRY!!!
Zombie King accidentally calling Harry Shawrey all ep without realizing was killing me 🤣
THE STREAK IS OVER!
Why didnt Tom take one of the icons of Shawrey or Harry? Funeral scene was funny as fck haha with Shawrey trumpet in the background, didnt notice harry lost the streak before hahah
That ending 😂
Shawrey sleeping in the makeup
Tom and shawrey teaming up against my glorious king and the peoples champ harry is just pathetic
How tf did Shawrey not have the best pumpkin
GC ARMY!!!! The stakes have been reset now....you have to be impartial for reals now mate.....also UP THE SPURS TOM!!!!
RIP the streak, Harry is still my GOAT
this Harry loss will always have an asterisks next to it, still the invincible in our hearts
can we agree shawrey cheated since his using his cousin's div 7 acc meaning better elo
33:38 has to be one of the middle class things thats been said on a Hashtag video 😂
Tom 39-7 what kind of corruption is this played an extra game
It took George missing penalties and losing games for Harry alongside Tom spinning two greens this week, but it is finally over. RIP the invincible streak
Tom - Rio N GA Mo A
RIP Harry the invincible and GC i will never forgive you never
ending was absolute cinema. Best FIFA account on the web hands down
Love how they had to shorten the amount of weeks for them to end the streak 😭
One of the best videos I've ever seen
Three week month and Shawrey using an eight year old’s account. Biggest asterisk I’ve ever seen 😂
i lowkey thought that was chuffsters
How come the weekend league records are 43-45-46 games played? I wouldn’t take Harry losing if Tom had one more game to get the 39th win. Harry gets one game I say to draw it, anything not to end the streak 🔥 😭
harry should not have won any of these challenges ref is corrupt
how the hell did showery loose the pumpkin challenge GC get off Harry's pipi
How did Tom go 39-7? That’s 46 games not 45?????
You need to bring back the 4 week months
Shawrey on his cousins account for better match making is criminal
Forgot Duranville was English for a perfect link 😂
Shawrey used this team on his channel 😂
Where is Tom 2nd Green Spin 🤔
Not having Harry do the undertakers rising from the dead/coffin scene whilst the other two walked away is a massive L
2 TIMES INVINCIBLE YOULL NEVER SING THAT
HE USED TO PLAY FOR PRACTICEEEEEE
GC ending the streak Harry's invincible run ending as the underwear taker ABSOLUTE CINEMA 👐
according the the zombie king guy Shawrey actually lost this month
I swear i've seen the Zombie King bloke on another vid somewhere but I can't place it
The ending was absolute cinema
💔💔 will never lose a 60 game month
Harry being dressed as the undertaker and having the streak defeated feels so fitting
Zombie king is a legend
Wheel challenge: play a game wearing snow gloves
Absolutely amazing video lads, from the effort to the production, you’re gonna smash it once again this year! Will Shawrey go undefeated this year??
I am actually sad
To be fair it took 3 of them to take Harry down. Not only that but it had to be his Everton brethren 😂
That was just class. So funny. Zombie king shouting shawrey at harry was jusy peak. Not laughed that much in a while. Top vid lads.
Shawrey stop screaming
absolute cinema
The most insane episode ever!!!
Gc defeating harry was actually bigger than brock lesner ending undertakers streak cinema
Shawrey got robbed 2 times in challenges 🥲🥲 POGMOL need some changes, its rigged 🤣🤣
Tom I lost a game 10:7
I love you Shawrey my absolute kingyyyy Is gonna go on a tear in fc26 and not lose a single month I can feel it 👍😍❤️
Can already tell from the draft part this is gonna be a banger 🤣 Also Shawrey's costume is unreal  Edit - Shoz loss streak over and the people's champ's streak over in the same week what a strange time 😂  We won't forget the last 2 years H 🫡
Juan Mata's career has gone a very different way to what I expected.
Ea literally said your division affects your match making this is a disgrace of a month
Seeing how Tom handles any task besides playing EA FC, have you considered having him checked? :/
51:54 didnt Tom also score on a trick before this?
Who is the idiot that played tom at the end? We need to know
Making it 3 week months so Harry loses is crazy btw. 19-0 gone but never forgotten.
Nah I had to rewatch the Zombie King section, some of the stuff he was saying was actually hilarious
ETS! ETS! ETS!
This month has been a disgrace and should be wiped from the record and we should start from the beginning the first week with no matchmaking the second week shawrey went 15-0 and bullied tom showing there is no justice and now the referee all I’m saying is Harry hesketh is the invincible still
How can people not hate Harry I’m so happy hahahaha. Moans about the 0 chem wheel spin he agreed on, Tom didn’t even take his player on the second green spin, asks Shawrey not to distract him and yet in Tom’s biggest game spends the whole match screaming in his ear. VAMOSSSSSSSS REST IN PISS STREAK
Harry has let everyone down 😢
Surely at Christmas time you get the zombie king to cone back as the grinch for more chaos
Someone said that this video feels like the old FIFA videos and I couldn’t agree more! Great vid lads, can’t wait for more.
Rest in peace. 🪦
Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened
Funny how shawrey is better with silver teams than actual good teams
Why are you doing Halloween a week early? 😂😂
Shawrey robbed twice btw😂
showery clearly won the pumpkin wow its so bias
Was buzzing for a Halloween themed episode. 👍  Zombie King totally ruining the vid. 👎 Hit and miss on this one buds.
Harry doesn’t like someone else being centre of attention 🤣 great vid as always 👌🏻
Top 100 with a bronze team, top 3 with a silver team.
I'm not going to lair but that could of been one of the best episodes ever
Who's dad is this 🤣🤣🤣
Missed opportunity of: The haunting of hashtag house not gonna lie
The coffin at the end was class
its over I cant believe it years of waiting and its gc to end the streak ETS was successful
Convinced that guy is toms dad
Honestly what a brilliant Video 👏 and the way Harry is knocked off his perch by GC poetry in motion 🎉
I can’t believe none of you used my superstar teddy okou
End was so good 😂
Null and void
The invincible streak is over. But it still stands. Harry went 20 months invincible. What an achievement. Going 2 years unbeaten is some achievement
Shawrey’s clown drawing got some chest 😂
29:21 haram is basically the same meaning as sin but in islamic religion
who tf is #that😂
Cheers lads took a reduction of a week from a “month” shawrey on a div 8 account and tom to spin 2 greens disgusting work lads horrible
PUGMOL harry bias is insane in this video
this channel man
Shawrey won the pumpkin challenge!!
Shawrey was praying for harry’s downfall for 18 months never seeen him locked in in toms last game and happier after GC penalties
Did Harry enter the last game on 0 chem? It wasnt shown.
post-credit scene in a hashtag house vid is crazy btw
Rip Harry’s streak :(
I cant believe it, Ive never enjoyed a video so much, top content
HE’S GOT A PUUUUUMPKIN, ON HIS HEAD 🗣️🎶
Here to spread my Spurs agenda..... SPURS TO WIN THE CL AND PL THIS SEASON..... Sorry Harry...❤....
i loved the first like 20 mins that was hilarious. The way Shawrey just stands on all the couches constantly as well 😂, like sit your ass down bro its a couch 😂
That fella was funny for like 2 minutes then it was just like fuck off mate😂
🔥🔥🔥
40:40 is a disgrace
now in the GC army! ETS ETS ETS
I can’t believe it.. who’s gonna win for me and you now??
Naah this bloke is ruining the vid for me lads ngl
Whys aj3 wearing the top hat and calling harry shawrey
If yous dont start the next shoot with harry doing takers sit up yous have missed out on a solid reference haha
when did harry lose a 4 streak??
Sad to see shawrey the undertaker isnt invincible anymore 😭
Harry is so shit for not finding pumpkins
TEAM HARRY!
Zombie king needs to come back for Christmas as Santa 😂
Why did is fully expected a Gong at the end?
Nah that guy was annoying AF and not necessarily to this video
The streak was the only thing interesting about the channel
The greatest hashtag champs video there has ever been. 25 years old on the edge of my seat watching a youtube video 😂 ETS
Shaweys fav phrase is ... puts it in boys... he loves it
never watching your vids again
Knew it was over for harry when the zombie king said nobody was asked about the streak
Greatest #sunday vid ever
Dead channel
What kind of mickey mouse opponents is shawrey getting? XD
Hahah this was a cinematic masterpiece
Massive asterisk *****
Not worth watching anymore man
This shits hilarious
This is pure cinema!! GGs lads.
Tom with elite ball knowledge 2 minutes into the video "Couple interesting picks there Itani"
need a harry EOAE sbc
Thank you for the efforts 🔥 🐦 📛 🔥
Justice for Tom
That zombie king was class but i feel very overstimulated now😅
Shawrey is actually a big loser omg
Technically the streaks not over as harry kept being called shawrey so it was shawrey in disguise! We all saw that right 😂
the zombie king rules. i hope you paid him well
We want upload everyweek back how it used to be makes it more entertaining
Crazy how it's Halloween season and Shawrey has two ghosts next to him in the form of Salah and Isak 😂😂😂
You know, I was calling for some decisive action against GC army after that wheel spin game, but now im starting to think that this might just have been staged. All of this drama, the ups, the lows, Tom's heart palpitations, just for GC to put the final nail in the coffin. Fair play
finally. The shozmeister is back to winning ways. 🎉🎉🎉
How come harry didn’t spin the wheel when lost the first 2 times????????
Nah GC saying trick when is was treat is diabolical, he definitely knew it was treat as well. Proper scummy behaviour 😂 and I absolutely love itttt
Shawrey saying Giles wrong hurts everytime
impressive trumpet work shawrey!
GC pumpkin judging skills are absolutely shocking
That is sooo corrupt the coffin was there from the being he was undertaker 😢😢 MY KING RIP THE STREAK 19 months he reign supreme doesn’t matter who’s in his team.
Genuinely losing the streak while dressed as the undertaker is so elite, if only shawrey dressed as Lesnar
Shawerys Pumkin was robbed of the best like haha
costumes are top tier
The ending of this video was peak 🤣
Wait both finished the month on 7 losses how has he lost the month? Or are the records at the end wrong
GC you absolute legend
We all know if it was a 60 game month Harry wouldn’t have lost 🤷🏽‍♂️ but all good things come to an end
One of the greatest videos to grace YouTube ever
Tbh shouldn’t of even gone that far. Tom had a swap player at the end and could’ve taken moore for the haram ball
Nah this channel is actually GOATED! When Tom pulled out his pumpkin i broke 😂
THE STREAK IS OVER !!!🤣🤣🤣😭
This is an all timer. Editing and work that goes into the videos are a joke. Incredible
shawreys hair transplant took a turn
THE STREAK IS OVER 🎉
Tom never did his second swap did he?
GC in a brock lesnar costume next week!
Shawrey was robbed, his pumpkin was by far the best
THE STREAK IS OVER 😮
53:59 and 54:09 are such brilliant clips and piece of ”in character-moments” specially with the lighting on Shawrey hahahaha rewatched it so many times I love it
great quality vids lads. 3 a month was a great idea, wasnt tom supposed to swap a player at the end? You guys should do a mixed team, 2 bronze, 2 silver, 3 gold, 2 promos, 2 icon/heroes.
It was a pleasure to watch the invincible streak sad it had to come to an end but it will never be forgotten
Harry you are a fraud for not usin rohl from everton
So poetic for GC AAARRRMMYY to finish Harry’s steak 😂😂 great vid boys love the contemt
Wait what, how has Tom finished 39-7, that's 46 games when 15x3=45?  So how did Harry already lose the streak the game before?
Anyone else not realize they planned to end the streak? To have a coffin there and to use it in that way #makeitmakesense
Look I enjoy the videos and all and I’ve not even watched this but Alex tries so hard to be funny and it’s not even really cringe, just annoying, u really are annoying Alex
You missed a trick there, Harry should have sat bolt up right in the coffin on the end credit. Great video lads always make the first day of work each week a bit more bearable!
They scripted this so harry loses the streak as the undertaker
Green should not be on the wheel. So boring
Shawrey u made us proud kingy , it had to happen Harry. Now you can win the upcoming months again.
Watching this at 2am when I have to be up in a few hours😭. But priorities!!
No one wanted the streak to end
2 years unbeaten is crazy especially considering he has been playing against 2 pros as an ex pro
The most corrupt month is the one Harry looses. it’s a good thing though tbf shawreys whole personality was just about Harry loosing which was becoming absolutely painful to watch.
That zombie king dork keeps calling harry shawrey ? Why
Shawrey with a bald spot on top of his bald spot 👌🤣 Sorry mate
the way u pronounced van ewijk was horrible but W vid lads
Massive massive asterisk next to this shawrey month
Giles is goated well picked
I can’t lie this random bloke ruined the video
GC ended the streak 🎉
The best video in hashtag house history?  It's not for me to say but yes.  Yes it is.  Zombie King was just top tier stuff, lads. 😂
Tom's pumpkin🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gc fucked that month for Harry fr
Tom not taking moore at the end and giving harry dibling and almost botling it pissed me off soo much
That zombie king is 100% Tom’s dad, spitting image.
It is so fitting to lose it as the undertaker, at least compared to who undertaker lost it to, it is only fitting, GC was the one to take him down.
Shawrey is so jarring
This months loss don’t count wipe it from the history books imo
Why did Tom move setup ,
“Let’s go to the wheel… where the fucks the wheel” 😂
Harry winning the pumpkins is corruption at its finest
Tom having literal potato’s as opponents every month needs to be investigated
history has been witnessed
One of the forfeits on the wheel should be random formation that you have to stick with till the end of the video
It took the whole might have the hashtag house to defeat The Underweartaker’s 19-0 streak. This was HH wrestlemania’s main event😂 quality content.
All great things must come to an end... But it will never be matched, never be topped. Harry was, is, and forever will be the Hashtag GOAT!!
It’s actually nuts how much better Harry and Tom are compared to Shawrey 🤣🤣 they score the better and more creative goals where as Shawrey just cut back player locks and score kick offs after he use to moan and groan about kick offs! Tragic
Shawery actually proper scary
Tom 39 and 7, Played 46 games😂😂
This is up there with your best videos ever. So good lads!
Maybe a wheel spin could be monitor brightness on the lowest u can see on
HIHIHAHAAA
Finally no more of that annoying song. Thank you Gc,Tom and Shawdog.
Danm, this is a big jump in production level in a single ep. GCARMY!
The zombie king cursed harry by calling him shawrey at the start
Shawrey playing Div 8 players on matchmaking should be punished no way he wins this month otherwise 😂
That’s such a pathetic way to end Harry’s streak one week less to play and using silver teams with shawrey on a different account #rigged shawrey is clearly the worst and for him to win any month is fishy
Kutesa is the best silver on the game
I loved the ending RIP HARRYHESKETH the streak is over , well in Tom and shawrey
Nobody going to talk about how Shawrey has won the first month every year. RIP Invincible
END THE STREAK!!!!!!
Honestly the Zombie guy is great
You need to put your monthly scores along with weekly scores as you go so we can keep up 😂
Absolutely crying with laughter
Harry losing pretty much puts zero point of watching any more Sundays
Here after only Spurs won their game 😂
They used to play for practice…
Harry only lost the month because he was playing the last week calleld Shawrey
has tom ever interacted with a human outside of the house bless him😭
I’m actually creasing 39:28 😂😂😂
Looking by resemblance that’s harry uncle
Cinema
Don’t mess with the zombie king! Best episode, well played gc 🐐
Sorry lads, this was cringe
ETS baby woooo
Time to retire from watching HH in action on sunday! Harry well done!
Just like what Tchouameni said last season - "They celebrate our losses like we ain’t gonna win again. We will be back"
We need more zombie king
Not the Zombie King calling Harry "Shawrey" 😂😂😂 must be some sort of curse to make him lose the month cos he's playing like Shawrey normally does
idk where tf you found that guy but hes absolutely class 😭😭🙏
15:55😂😂😂
Where did they find the evil mf from sky landers
Shawrey gets a wheel spin witch pretty much wasn’t even a spin
Shawrey fav week cos he can acceptably be himself and look normal 😭
Are we ignoring the fact Shawrey just time wasted to win the challenge 😂😂 blatant corruption
would never lose a 60 game month- null and void
Shawrey that’s not how you say Giles it’s pronounced like a J
Two years of Harry trying to lose, now the next streak can begin next month. Good vid lads.
IT HAPPENED!!!! 😂
Hes finally lost a month
the streak can never truly be broken. it’s not a thing, it’s a state of mind. I CAN HEAR THEM CRYING ON FLOOR 2
The undertakers streak has come to an end...and it didn't even Brock Lesnar this time, just a Zombie King, a Clown and a Mad Scientist. Truly the greatest gaming achievement in history but if the script goes well. The undertaker always rises from the dead 🙏. Great vid guys and can't wait for the next one, Harry (or Shawrey) is just gonna have to do what he does and break another record and beat his streak, ez for someone like him tho
now the streak has ended get Jamodo in on sunday vids I beg. Would add a whole new dynamic to the videos. Shawrey will still find a way to lose the month tho AHAHHA
Absolute cinema
all good things must come to end this kinda made me tear up 😢
nice to see the trip to turkey went well for shawrey
wheel spin idea to change binds but i think only for like the bumpers and the triggers so its not too bad but can definitely mess you up a fair bit with like trying to finesse
Nah can’t lie this draft is a hard watch
shawrey looks a bit different this week
tom with the inabillity to build a team again
Shawrey finally loses a month
Nah not having it cut 15 games away to end the streak! Disgraceful behaviour
RIP Harry you will be remembered as a legend of the game forever 😢
SPOILER!!! 🚨    October 2023 - October 2025. 0.0451% chance. It will never be done again 💙  Would never lose a 60 game month btw
24:39 is this true abut champs Elo/matchmaking difficulty if you forfeit?
Why was a player not swapped for the second green, yet more corruption for 'the peoples champ' not to mention how much better Shawreys pumpkin was...
Corruption
I feel like a dreaming after that last match finally the streak end’s
What is with the adverts every 2 mins? Annoying AF!
Harry must be freezing -8 in his room 🇱🇻
Best edited video in ages, bravo gc
Shawrey doing the trumpet as Undertaker’s theme song was sick!
GC isn't the editor anymore im convienced he would never get them out this early lol
Just at the start. Quick question. Shawrey gets to choose to be anyone for halloween yet chooses another bald bloke. Why
Absolute cinema
Never ever bring zombie king guy ever again
Cracking rick cosplay Tom.
I like Harry, though sometimes he can be a bit of a crybaby.
So if the month is 45 matches are we gonna miss an upload so it's gonna be 3 sundays in a month instead of 4?
Shawreys pretty much chosen the same team when he did the silver team thing on his acc and matchmaking was horrible
Hats off to who did shawrey’s makeup
This content just getting better every week and year!! Not single fc YouTuber can beat this channel I love every Sunday video!! Make ups are unreal!! The ending was peak 😂😂😂 (not going spoiled it) 💙💛
Shawrey's pumpkin by far should have won and we all know it. Robbery.
They’ve just basically made it impossible for Harry to win? What a let down
harry will always be an invincible
Sorry but shawry won the pumpkin and the mummy 😮🫨🫨
That was well worth an hour and forty minutes of my life 😂 such a good episode
GC ARMY MY GOAT
Three of the best, he’s made them pay! Once again, hats off GC!
Well dont worry harry he will get the streak again they wont get it
Only way they could take him down was by changing the amount of games they played T.T
Dortmund english - dortmund belgian = perfect link 😂😂
Doesn’t count imo. Short changed the month by a week so Harry remains invincible. Shawrey is a clown literally
Petition for the Zombie king to be a permanent member of the hashtag house.  Ps.  Not even Hollywood could produce such a perfect ending.  RIP. Mr. UnderwearTaker
Only just watched the draft, already want Shawey to win having two Cov lads in #PUSB and a P&P.
Tom what did you think of dibling? I loved his silver card so decided to evo him. Where can I send his stats to show you? Shawrey, it will be back to reality next month
What an ending absolute cinema
Why is shawrey playing against dumb and dumber
tom can't build a full team even with futGG
Nobody fucking spoil that ending! #GCARMY!
With the run of the invincible over, we need forfeits back for the month’s loser! We need stakes!
May the shawrey supremacy reign on I knew Harry lost the month before as well can’t believe it
That editing for the final 30mins was insane. It’s 10pm, I need to go to bed and I couldn’t switch off 😂😂
After watching this have to watch the rest back and question everything pugmol has decided in Harry's favour games gone I vote for a no confidence send GC on a ref course
Harry you know what u done buddy🐀
RIP the underwear taker.
I saw ange postenoglu today
I’m not kidding that month has got to be void  Btw shawrey cheating using his cousin’s account  1st week matchmaking being corruput  Due to this that week needs to be re- run and we will not be stopping until it is
The invincible streak is over but we'll always remember it. Grandkids will be told all about it in future generations.
Brilliant brilliant video guys love the creativity
Is GC feeling alright??? No hashtag house Mondays so far
The underwear taker 🤣🤣🤣
This will be so sick if they make Harry rise out the coffin like the under wear taker used to do ready for next month
40:50 shawrey robbed
Nah Shawrey looks so creepy
Love a hashtag house vid, highlight of the week
Toms pumpkin is on the spectrum 😂
GS should get banned to ref 1 week after this
Harry losing is so sad. Ruined my year
Shawwryy got robbed on the pumpkin tbh
first month is always a friendly anyways
This channel has brought back that good nostalgic fifa YouTube, despite the football game not being what it once was.  So thank you to everyone involved.
The zombie king Calling Harry shawry was class 😭😭😭
Gutted harry loosing has actually ruined my weekend
For some reason “I thought u were gonna burn him” killed me😂😂 13:49
Why this guy in black on beginning looks like Juan Mata
Warning: Spoliers  .   .   .    .       For the lads to mess up the math on when Harry lost the streak and only realise it during editing is peak Hashtag House, Top 5 FIFA/FC moment of all time though haha
He will become invincible again
Harry's 0 fucks woohoo nearly ended me man 😂😂😂😂😂
Please tell me there is an outtakes video.
13:45 Tom getting jumped scared was elite🤣
Shawrey pumpkin robbed
Shawreys hairlines never looked better…
Nah as a jumpy person I feel for Tom man I would be pissing myself if a Donny dressed like that was roaming round my house 😂😂
Fair play lads 15m in and it’s got to be best video of the year.😂😂
Think it would be a good idea to have all 3 on the same Camera/stadium and opponents kits the same too.   Would make it way easier to know instantly who is playing.
Absolutely sensational this.
Love watching you gimps 😂🥰
damn who did shawreys face paint it looks class
Shawreys got a better hairline with that wig on.
surprised shawrey had to wear a costume just without his glasses he looks scary
I didn't know pumpkins could have a stroke but Tom's looked like it has.
cant believe sharwey didnt dress up for Halloween
Was the zombie king jamodo great vid so far ❤
That big creep is genuinely funny hahaha
nice if you guys to add “Haram Ball” on the wheel🤣🤣🤣 Cmon the Muslimsss❤️❤️
George Collins should be on the wheel punished by either egg or flour over the head 10 times after that coin flip situation,🤣🤣🤣
nah this budget
Unreal video - Zombie King is 👑👑👑
Can’t fathom how early this is, finally won’t oversleep work
Should’ve used da cunha his silver card is sick
Games back
Tom absolutely shitting himself 😂
40:41 holy robbery by underwear taker
GC TAKE A BOW SON 8PM UPLOAD
recommend sparking one before giving this a watch. Funniest thing I’ve seen in a while
harry hated that zombie king ahaha
Giles😂😂, poor pronunciation there shawrey fella
Im 20 mins and have already watched the funniest video ever
"people actually watch this?" hit me in the feels
Can you guys tell ea to fix its library, its removing the fc 26 from everyones library on pc.
Who's dad is out here cosplaying haha
0:32 The BUNDA-Taker
I'm sorry... 8pm on a Sunday? GC forgot to put his clock back surely???
Warra vid
I'm 12 min in and hoping that Zombie King isn't actually there for the whole night/vid as he said because this is annoying af and taking away from the HH members interaction.  Edit: How on earth has Shawrey's pumpkin lost there? The eyes alone are miles ahead. Corruption!!! Corrupt GC needs to be investigated!  Edit 2: GC miscalling that trick or treat in Tom's game.... red card...  Edit 3: The Invincible forever
Cheers Shawrey the Mrs 💩 herself she hates clowns 😂
Will the undertaker affect Greggs opening times?
Harry looking like an alcoholic undertaker 😂😂😂
2:19 Harry this is becoming a bit of a recurring theme in the videos😭…
I CAN HEAR THEM CRYING ON FLOOR 2
Best YT house
8pm upload have we made sure this is actually gc?
Interesting pick there itani
The underwear taker 🤣
Why is juan mata being a creepy weird guy?
Nahh where’d yall find this zombie king bloke😭
Mental how Tom tried to build a full prem team ended with the worst chemistry out of all of them. That boy cannot draft 😂
Elite timing
just turned on the vid, if shawrey is doing that voice throughout the video ill start throwing bricks at random houses around derby until I get his childhood bedroom
Can you do a Scottish Accent?! 😂😂😂
- I will pick Rudoni -Do people actually watch this?😭😭
Shawrey looks absolutely disturbing
