mikel merino! Arsenal's New Striker! 🙃
Rubbish tactical decisions
United out of All Cups please = Improved chances of GLAZERS/INEOS out!
Varchester Unity get away with it massively Hairy Maguire miles offside!
Leicester played the offside perfectly.  That is absolute disgusting incompetence or someone is on the take 💵
Ineos: "We didn't get you a new striker but we got you a linesman"
Can never criticise ugarte.
This is why i was against Buying Wing Backs, Amorim has no future here, i just like this new coaches for beefing with Sancho and Rashford and getting rid of the parasite players
Big slabbers with the offside winner lets go 💪
Genuine Question Why did you not ger rid of Onana in the Transfod window the way you got rid of Rashford?
Been crying out for a left back, yet Dorgu is being used as a right-back
Bruno has been  our big problem  and I'm sure  the manager  must no this
I would definitely  not be watching  the nfl final  with you no thanks  Mark
Garnacho  man of the match without him we wouldn't  have won
You are a disgrace  you are just an bang average  Sunday  park footballer . All of y in yo chairs watching these are professional  footballers  its a 4th round FA cup. Goodbye  to y watch alongs no more.
Maguires head blocked the LMs view
I'm never  going to  listen  to another  watch along.  You are all  terrible  especially no it all Mark goldbridge.  I'm going  to watch the live utube watch along  from now on . Your all a disgrace to our manager and our players.  In listening to the live match comentry it's far better than  you no biase.
You all don't believe  in Amerins tactics your  so bad the lot of you.  You should be  ashamed
The solution about these inverted positions is simple, and Mark you’ve said it before: learn to use both feet! Keep the opponents guessing what you might do. Shoot/pass/cut in  unexpectedly…
Blame the goalkeeper  again  not his fualt Dalots fualt . As soon  as we go 1 down  there's abuse same  old same from you and  the fanbase.  Shame on you  all we won look at the positives.  Armchair  footballers that know it all . I'm the coach ,😡
Good show MG. Thankyou 👍
Thank bugger there is no var
Mainoo is so over rated and Hojlund is just utter garbage.
Offside mate
4 x Man utd players offside including the scorer Maguire....the match officials are a disgrace
2:22:15 the moment of realisation 😅🤣
Amorin get this fraud idiot out hrs useless
We really have to play tighter to the opposition it’s killing us giving away so much space. 😊he starts Dorgu plays him out of position he was a flicker of light), I suds like to see him in his proper position
Is this the football we are going to play under this guy💩
Amorim mate its strike two
80 million is justified
No one wanted to watch another 30 minutes of this crap- UTD escape
came here for the most miserable reaction to our win as expected!! but people must like misery!
Good to be reminded that VAR actually isn’t entirely crap.
YOU GUYS ARE TERRIBLE
Good job no var
RASMUS is Usless
Lessgo magurire
Ineos and parasite glazers are trying to get Garnacho out???? WTF How are they owners of this great club Get them out NOW
Wow, so many anti Amorim today!!. That was prepared/conterted before?
I am not mad just disappointed anyway congratulations Manchester united go through next round❤❤
We should've pushed to sell dalot to madrid
Sky sports will be so happy with that result even though it was miles offside..same old officials dodgy as f...k
Zirkzee appreciation ->>>>>>>>>>
Amorim has officially made us worse than under any previous managers.
I remember Dalot was good at attacking going up and down the pitch in a 4 at the back formation and now I'm wondering why he's so miserable at attacking even when he plays at RWB
Amorim is crap lads 😂 but so is everyone at our club so…..
Papering over the cracks……😂😂😂😂😂
the linesman didnt want to watch another 30 mins of that game. Legend!!
United beat a relegation rival thanks to no VAR
Varchester united😂😂🫏🫏🫏
The worst football I've seen in fifty years. Mind numbingly boring football. How many inverted players does this fella want on the pitch. Inverted 10's inverted wing backs means zero width. Five at the back at home oceans of room in our midfield between attack and defence. Leicester had the freedom of the park there. We only looked anything like when Garnacho gave us that bit of width. Bore off back to Portugal Amorim.
Sorry for telling you to oil up and shake it on camera mark goldbridge. This match had me at the edge of my seat.
We have got a serious problem  We desperately need shaw for the cup games for LCB. Even he cant match Martinez's ball progression and aggression. We need a midfielder too for those games, dont think we can play Bruno against better teams there.
He was miles off side
Nice offside win for Man U
We bought a LB, just to play him out of position. Maguire was way off, i guess the referees doesn’t want extra time either
Same old manure getting the officials to help them out...disgrace....miles off..absolute miles...
A win is a win  bud
Why does Amorim keep playing a right back as a left winger.  Does he not understand it doesn't work?
1:55:22 ahah😂😂
What has happened to this club?
Lino wanted to go home early
Get it done boyyzzz....
Get in harry you legend 😊
Well.. that was interesting
Normally VAR is against us so thank you VAR 🙏, we payed you.
Amorim is so unbelievably lucky, I’m over the moon we won but lets be honest he shouldn’t be in a job
Thank god for no VAR
Big Maguire with the offside header saving us the game.
How was dorgu ?
Off side, the blind could see!!! 😂😂😂
Offside
Amorim has to go
harry maguir
I think lino went I can't watch this for another half hour
This why VAR needs to be present. This is how United won titles back in tve stoneage.
Leicester 1 - 0   1:10:27 Man U 1 - 1         1:53:55 Man U 2 - 1         2:19:14
Come on United yess
Leicester got robbed that was a disgrace
Amoriim is tactically atrocious. The portuguese league is a horrible measuring stick.
Biggest robbery ever 😂
Still alive Fa cup & Europa league stay competition we good competition
Hojland is awful, can’t hold a ball up. Play breaks down every single time it goes to him.
Garnacho should start I think we need a change of formation
Playing with a bit of pace and direct play changed the game in the second half. Can’t carry too many slow players.
Today was Ruud's most adorable defeat
Woohoo. £2m extra income for gate receipts for the next round!!
Why couldn't  play like. That in first half
Hojlund man of the match
Maguire is the goat 🐐
Good thing that linesman was blind
offside
Leicester robbed
maguire saves us once again class player
Very lucky
Very lucky
So far offside but let's go slabhead😂
😂
That was clearly offside
Lord maguire get in.
GET AMORIM OUT NOW !
Why does Amorim keep playing Dalot on the left. It is a nightmare and has shown no signs of improvement under Amorim.
First
Very lucky
