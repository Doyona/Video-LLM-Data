Nasty never miss
I'm a day one Nasty C fan (my YouTube literally suggested Slow It Down after this song). I have to say, this song, and SOFT feat. Usimamane are both trash💔  In the 'I Love It Here' album we got some real music, but after that, it's like bro has either just been fooling around in the studio, or he's putting out music that he thinks most of his fans might enjoy. I definitely hope it's not the latter because there's no way real Nasty C fans would accept music of such a low standard.🚮
Ivison never made a Bad song 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤟🏿
Just  when they thought his time is up bro dropped his rollie kwaphinde kwashuba..
