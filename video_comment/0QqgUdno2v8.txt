Officer asked “Is the door unlocked?” WTF?
Lord this is tuff
How many times sir he was clear for me the very first time he said his mama is in the damn car in the water
why am i crying!
I’d love an update on what happened with this story if anyone has an extended version or an update
Respect for the support and serve.Thank you for Helping and assisting ❤🎉😊
Is somebody in there? Really?
Cops are so dumb
This is so funny. I could not stop laughing. LOL
Miracles happen every day !!!  God bless you young man !!! Because of your actions you saved moms life !!!😊😊😊😊
Oh my heart!! So glad he got help!! God Bless everyone!!
This cop is slow as fuckkk
New law.. Those with eplicey should not drive or severe heart blood flow. Just sayn it can b dangerous 😮 BLESSINGS 🙏♥️🙏💜🌹
that officer didn’t exactly spring into action. 🤦‍♂️
Brave youngster and rescuers!
Thank God everything worked out and his mom was ok ✝️♥️🇺🇸🙏
The cop helped, but it was the lirrle boy who saved her. I'm  glad the cops were able to his mom.
Stupid ass questions he is asking a child “is the car unlocked”???? The kid is smarter than he is!!!
That is a NIGHTMARE of mine!!!! I have epilepsy and it's considered "controlled". I am so VERY AFRAID to get behind the wheel. My seizures started when my children were 20 yrs old, 14 yrs old and 12 yrs old. Thankfully I have NOT had to drive since then. Although, my Dr says I may drive, I don't believe I will attempt it.  I've had seizures for 14 yrs now.
Gd is good❤❤❤Amen🙏🙏🙏
What a good Sameritin
You save her live.
The cop wasted a good amount of time asking " is she in there..is somebody in there" when the little kid already said his mom was in there....!!! If it was a dog drowning, he would have jumped right in without wasting a second...
And God bless the child 🙏
God bless the officer 🙏
I don't like this officer responded😢
Smart knowledgeable boy all saved ...t😂
Thank God.❤
How terrifying for the child.  I just wanted to give him the biggest hug.  ❤
He’s his momma’s guardian angel 👼🏼 🙏🏼💜
❤
I could feel the fear!! He was so scared!😢😢😢 Thank you officer!!
🔥🧲until they quit existing they are crushing us
What’s dumb question?? Didn’t the boy tell you his mom is in the car??? Really dude?? What do you mean is somebody there ??? What do you mean is somebody there ???
Ems should know you cant open a door under the fkn water 🤦🤦🤦
Cop taking his sweet ass time
Terrifying for that child hope they will be ok Good Samaritan cop darn is right  Good put themselves out there everyday ❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Lord 🤲
This made me so upset for this child!! Poor thing
I almost can’t believe that I feel the need to point this out, but this video supports the argument that not all white people are evil racists. The rescuers in this video (who were all white), helped this woman and her kid who are black. I would have helped them as well, but I feel the need to point this out because there are many black people infected by the Woke/DEI virus that would have you believe that white people are so inherently racist that they would never help anyone who is not white. Yet they choose to ignore that although some white people were slave owners, it was ultimately other white people who ended slavery and freed the slaves. White people are not evil, nor are they any more racist than anyone else. It makes me sad that there is so much anti-white vitriol online, when all you need to do is look around and realize that most people are kind and willing to help anyone who is in need. That’s that civilization is all about.
Is the car unlocked?  Dude
“She’s in the water!”  *cop goes to water*  “iS sOmEoNe iN tHeRe?” Dude spent about 10 seconds asking if someone was in the water before he went 🤦‍♂️
The anxiety it gave me watching, omggg🙏🏻
Sees a car in the water before I get in let me ask is somebody in there multiple times before I get in and get wet
Looks more like a suizide try...m
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Oh my heart💔🙏🏼
Thank you Jesus 🙏
I thank God with all of my heart and soul, that this person listened and helped this family. God Is Truly a Miracle Worker all day, and Every day!❤❤❤
Guardian angels were with both of them🙏🏽🙏🏽
Was she saved ????
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Driving while epilectic ???? 😮 ahes lucky she didnt kill her and her son. Is she still driving today?
Boy: She's locked in there!  Car flipped over:  Guy: Name and date of birth please
God bless the responders.
I pray they are alright.
Tf was the cop slow About it for tho damn…
With an accent like that, i find it hard to believe no one nearby had a wench.
Thank you Jesus 🙏
Oh I love you son. God bless you and your mom. A million thanks to the brave cop and two other men who helped them both. God bless you all.
Thank you God and Thank you to the cops that helped
dude was taking his time , you can hear the kid saying " cmon!" to him twice while he standing there feeling all fat and talking
“Is somebody in there?” Bruh how much more confirmation do you need?
男の子本当に偉かったね！ ママを守ったんだね🙏
God bless his heart. ❤✝️🕊
Great rescue. Did victim hate cops 5 minutes before, as the left teaches people to do?
Thank you officer ❤
Sending Healing to this fam and a big gratitude of grateful for the man who volunteered and helped the fam❤😊❤
officer moving slow smh
damn seeing him like that hurt my feelings 😢
The cop is really taking his sweet time isnt he
❤❤❤
The cop clearly didn't want to get wet.
Why did they blur the mom’s dace but not the boy’s?
No one thinks the guy who got the other person out, isn't a real hero ?  He's in there before the cop ?
can someone pls explain to me the purpose of wasting time with that "is someone in there"
They was in no hurry at all wth
The boy broke my heart
Thank  God and thank the child ❤❤❤❤❤
Thank God for her life, this really shows mothers are the hearts of their children.
Thank God for her life, this really shows mothers are the hearts of their children.
Cop sucks. She probably won’t have made if it wasn’t first her baby saving her❤
They reacted way to slow. I said there is somebody in. The pilice wit quite passion wlks slowy in the water and yell......
Poor baby he is scared to death! May God always protect him and his mommy ❤
Not me holding my breath because I was worried
anyone talking about how slow the officer was in the first few moments???
Just told you someone was trapped   "Is somebody in there?"  Bruh
bro is the man fr that cop didn’t hesitate and jumped in what a man bro
He knows she has seizures. This means she shouldn't be driving.
😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏
Take your time  camera man   ..wrong colour to do stuff fast
is it jusr me or should she not even be allowed to drive fullstop if she suffers from seizures !!
Woman: *clearly screaming* Cop: “is anyone in there?”
He seemed more annoyed
Whoever has raised this child has done a good job of teaching them what to do in an emergency.  He did a great job as did the officer of the law!
Why tf did the cop ask the little boy if the car was unlocked? What a stupid question..! Just go check!!
That young boy will be a cop.
electric windows do not open, door locks stay locked. I sank my car in 16' of water in a storm & had roll down windows or I would have died.
WHY WOULD OFFICER WASTE TIME AND ASK: IS THERE ANYONE THERE???
cool, didnt think it would take so long for help to arrive. At least they were able to get her
This is why people with seizure disorder have driving restrictions. I don't know if this is a first time for the lady and I hope she makes full recovery.
SOMEBODY GET THESE MEN AND THAT BOY A PARADE!!!!!!
😢😢😢😢😢ياالله ياالله ربي ينجيها و يحفظها
Another White racist cop helping  Black people. People should stop with that CRAP. Great job officer.
Да уберите вы эти телефоны!!! И спасите наконец!
the kid literally sobbing and screaming to help her mom who is sinking in the car The cop who’s literally looking at the sinking car: “is somebody in there?”
Praise God for this police officer, one who cares about all people regardless of color❤ Bless him & take care of him Lord!!!!
is she ok now? how's the boy? he was so brave. God bless them both and the rescuers.
My heart is broken, he is her HERO...Great job Mama😢😢❤
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
what the hell he was slow as FFFFFF
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Don't follow google map blindly, at least they are safe
thnk GOD
Sweet soul ❤❤❤❤❤
❤🥲❤️
Where is that officers glass breaker? I always wear mine on my gear to break windows under water...
Who is filming this....?
Как же ему было страшно.... сердце разрывается от увиденного
Kid: "Shes in there!"  Officer: "Is anyone in there?" moves slower than a snail
Water rescue is no joke It should be taught at the DMV not as a punitive measure, but as a safety measure, and the DMV should be ashamed of themselves making everything so punitive should always be a tool to escape readily available for all drivers passengers and people in the backseat.
I’m not even trying to be like that that cop took his time
That officer did not seem in a hurry at all.
Omg 😮 does anyone know what happened afterwards
God bless them
Officer asking all the wrong questions, lil bro crying his eyes out screaming and officer asks “is it unlocked” bruh wtf
Awesome! That young man did GREAT getting help for his Mom! Thanks so much to the officers involved as well!
Cop was pretty slow…
The guy "is she in there? Is somebody in there?" DAMN MY GUY!?
Thank god her son knew to look for help asap! That quick thinking saved his mommas life
Thank God. ✝️🙏
I need to know they both ok now
ОНА ЖИВАЯ ЖЕНЩИНА??
Когда спасаешь, главное камеру в одной руке держать, так удобнее 😮
and to think demrats want to defund every police department across USA
this is one of the reasons i think governments should allow all unarmed tanks and armored vehicles to drive on public road since they can just back out of the water again because of their imense horsepower or you can just exit from the top which is likely not submerged in accidents like this due to the size of armored vehicles
Да выталкивание машину из воды
Бедный мальчик❤ какой шок перенес
Boys will always be their moms squire
Thank God for this officer being in the right place  that child mother was helped and this wasn't even the  more tragic for this child.  By the way officer your a hero Look at God
차 전체를 뒤에서  예인하는것이 빠를커요
This lil man is a hero. Bless his heart he is so brave and clear minded at a time like that . He gave all the details even though he was scared and shaking.
If that cop moved any slower or sounded any less concerned I’d fucking scream.
Crazy dangerous to not have manual lever for the windows. Electronics stop working while in the water and impossible to open the door. If you got electric windows, if you get in the water roll them down as soon as possible so you can get out
I hope she’s doing better and I hope that kid knows that he should be proud. Not everyone acts with clarity under stress and pressure and he did fantastic from what we know. To the people who helped this kid and his mother, you are the people that give faith to humanity. ❤
No urgency in that sad excuse of a police
Why the cop sound like Lucas black from f&f
Thank you for helping this Woman ,, and thank the LORD for this little boy.
I’m happy the cop helped but man he took to long for me to spring into action  but appreciate him I just got a lil annoyed with all the calling out to the mom should of been running and splashing water in my opinion but good job sir
Why the heck that she was even driving if she knew that she had seizure attacks now and then? Really mind-boggling.
Is somebody in there 😂😂😂😂😂 no a ghost drove it off the road 🤦‍♂️
Thank GOD he save his mom
❤🙏🏽
Thank you officer 💚🖖✨
I live down the road from where this happened. This little boy is a hero who saved his mother's life
良かった… 怖かったね。勇気を出してお母さんを救って偉かった！
Wow the kkkop acted like he didn't want to help her
Probably was high on crack
Hearing the boy cry so hard for his momma and for someone to help save her made me cry,  if I lost my mother I’d lose my life
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I’m proud of that boy and cop, but I wish the cop would have acted more promptly.
So, what's the follow-up on this, was the mom okay?
Господи помоги
Praise God for kindness ❤❤❤❤
😮😮😮😮😮
❤😢
Боже. Какое же потрясение пережил этот ребёнок! Этот день останется в его памяти на всю жизнь😢 Какое счастье! Что он и его мама остались живы!
That poor lil tramatized Angel😢❤😢❤😢
To God, be the glory
RIPRENDERE con il telefono mentre devi salvare una persona!!  Ma cosa hai nella testa?
Como llegó el carro allí? Sin frenos?🤔.bravo por el niño 👍👏👏👏👏
the cop was about to ask for his ID
coitado partiu o meu coração. Deus abençoe , ilumine e proteja esse garoto,  sua mãe e os homens que ajudaram.
Не нужно на машине ездить, лучшн на ослике.
Will someone tell me exactly what 'God' did to help this family? The child saved his mother's life not God. Please tell me what did he do to help these people? Asking respectfully
Они просто за сотрудницу заступились, а не за девушку-гражданку
Снимает он НА Х РА?
Praises be to God Almighty that they were able to rescue her❤✝️🙏❣️
That poor baby 😢😢😢 Broke my heart to see and hear him so scared and worried. Hope his mama survived.
UPDATE?!
OBVIOUSLY “somebody” is in the car!  The boy is screaming & pointing to his mom. Why is he taking his sweet time?!
Outstanding
Gratidão Senhor por mais um livramento 🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻❤️
félicitations, merci.
Well what happened????  I'm too involved now!!!
Poor kid
🙏🙏🙏
Просто с телефоном удобнее
Why was that woman allowed to drive if she can have seizures that result in this at any moment?
my HELLCAT 😿
ママに幸運を祈る
❤ ❤ The boy did the greatest thing seek help for his mommy.  He was terrified but made sure he's understood by speaking clearly.  Hope Mommy is fine and the boy.  Thanks to rescuers.  💕
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
he said his mom is in there and the cop yelling "is somebody in there" ... sir dont pmo
Boy: she is having a seizure, she sunk, she's in the water. After seeing the crash. Cop: is she there? loading ... is somebody in there? loading ... is the car unlocked? Vid description: Samaritan ...   I'm shocked, how is she still alive after all?
❤
Люди гибнут, а он спокойно снимает. Люди совсем с катушек съехали.
Thanks to this child and officer  ....this is also  why no matter how  racist  some cops are and treat black  people  bad......we still can not teach our kids to be inti police
I'm trying not to be rude but wtf is this cop doing? He's shouting at the car like, "is somebody in there," when this boy clearly told him that his mother had a seizure,she's not gonna pop her head up and say something to him. That young man is a real hero.
The kid IS a hero...He remained calm when it mattered...He got out, got help + now gets shown tons of love❤❤❤
she shouldn't have parked there
Sad
Poor baby 😢
Not ALL cops are assholes
💔😔🕯👁‍🗨🕯
❤❤❤😮
🪨
Tadinho
Really souperman❤
😮😮😢
Ooo god. Why make me cry 😭😭😭 today
Cops.filming instead running?!?!?!
🥺🥺❤️‍🩹💝❤❤❤
Lord thank you.
Sending healing energy to her. He took long enough to decide to save her sheesh
Don't use the term "good Samaritan" for this. This is the cop's job. Good Samaritans help even when they're not expected to.
You can't park there ma'am
That little boy deserves an award for saving his Mama!!
Great everyone helped, but it seems like the cop was kind of slow about it all.
Praying for all involved❤
Omg😢 God saved the child and his mother
I feel like the cop was a little slow to respond and she could have been out a lot sooner I pray for her and her brave very, articulate child. He Clearly stated his mom had a seizure and drove her car into the water so when he got there, he should’ve been getting her out the water instead of asking is somebody in there multiple times.
I live in Kissimmee Florida while I was watching the video I just broke down and started crying I am a nurse and my daughter in law suffers from Seizures and ran her car off the highway they took her License she can’t drive again poor little boy May Go watch over them all Officers you are heroes and May the blessings of God be on you all thank you
My heart breaks for this young man you can hear it in his voice God Bless him
Hope she is well now ❤
What a brave officer. 💙💙💙
People with known seizure conditions should NEVER be driving, ever. I pray that she is ok and thank God for the boy and police officers. 🙏🏼
Thanks to Jehovah! The family is blessed.
Dumb ass fucking cop “is the car unlocked”
Why didn't he believe him right away? The kid said seizure, she's in the water/car, she's sunk...why call out? is that procedure? Seconds matter
Imagine being led to a half submerged car with screams coming from it after a child tells you their mum is stuck in a submerged car only to ask Is SoMEboDY IN TheRE rent a fuggin brain my guy
Good thing a trooper was near . Bless his heart. He was so scared.
Woah i Hope this turned out well
😢😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
The cop not approching untull the kid us repeated begging him is crazy to me.  U know that vops need to look after their own safty but that ladies life was at risk.   If i was that kid, i wpuld have felt to helpless in that moment knowing that the only adult who is able to help me/save my mom in that moment is standing there like a dumbass
Good boy!! You saved your Mom's life by getting help.
You Got a Brave Son Mom..and thank you guys for saving her.
You see that’s why we need our own police in us we can’t be in a place where we have a complete set of other people who do not give a fuck about us or our well-being. We can’t be around these people. This is the end.
glad this seems to have a happy ending and that the officer helped but the officer's lack of haste was glaringly alarming to me..especially in a situation like this where every second counts...no one else see that too?
🙏❤️🙏
I have a neighbor who is not allowed to drive because she has seizures. I wonder if this was her first seizure.
Pense era un films 😮 bravo ❤
Yes thank god for her son getting help and thank god for the cop helping also
Bro why would the vop waist precious seconds to ask if sb was in there  Obviously someone is in there bro.
He's a hero,  saved his mom life ❤️
Officer made me mad talkin bout “is someone in there” like the boy didn’t just say she sunk and had a seizure 🤦🏾‍♂️ hope she good tho
So many comments arguing about who actually saved the boys mom. Does it really matter who helped save her! What matters is she was saved. Praise our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who in reality was the one who saved her. Had God wanted her then she would have not survived. Amen. Hod bless.
God is always on time when you need Him ❤
No way is that Liam from shameless?
Thank you for helping this child and Mom .God Bless you Sir.🙏🏽🙏🏽✝️❤️
I pray for them 🥺❤️and I hope she made a full recovery 🙏🏾🙏🏾
🙏🏻
I'm glad he helped but that "Is somebody in there?" annoyed the hell out of me. Clearly there is, just get in there.
❤🙏
r.i.p dodge charger 😭 😢 😢 😭
That cop was WAY TOO SLOW to take action in that situation wtf
Why do cops always ask stupid questions?! Is somebody in there?! Of course, why else would the boy be crying for help?
BOY AND COP BOTH HEROS! BTW Mom shouldn't be driving with seizures!! Thats a nono !!
❤ without hesitation he went to save her and that wonderful little boy so upsetting.
he really has to turn on his camera first that the most important thing
Why he asked was anybody else in there when he just told him shes in the water? Why he's taking his time like that
Still want to defund them..the vast majority of everyday interactions are good ones..but dems would have you believe otherwise.
❤
😮😮😮😮
😢😢😢💯🙏❤️
"is somebody in there" like bro shes having a seizure do something idiot
Praise the Lord
He just told you his mom had a Seizer and was in the car.  Thank God you Helped Hopefully the mom survived.  Lord help her🙏🏼
Hey that’s my hometown!
Yeah,  let's defund the police!
Leg das Handy weg und helfe
Wow, God bless that kid.  He found a way to get out of a sinking car, swam out of the water then found help from an officer to rescue his mom, he's a true hero!  👏 👏 👏 👏
😢😢😢
Felt for the kid..
Oh my goodness 😮😢
Ainda tiveram tempo de filmar  ??? Pra quê ???😮😮😮
That was very brave of them all❤✨️✌🏽😎
Liam from shameless ❤(I’m sorry for both of them )
Abençoados todos os envolvidos
RIP
Amazing kid!
why he screaming "is she in there? is somebody in there?" when clearly her kid already said his mom is stuck in the car having a seizure 😡
Lord Have Mercy and thank you JESUS.
That cop is lame my dog would had more get up n go !
Thank God and all the people involved! God bless..
Can I just say that cop is lucky cuss he was not he was taking his time getting. To the car
Gb that boy❤
Is somebody in there??  what an idiot
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢Боже Матінко Божа
Praise God. Thank you little boy and officer
Graças a Deus
I feel so bad for the little boy😢
God Bless you all in Jesus Christ mighty Name ❤
Instant tears 😭. Like someone punch me in the throat. Lord have mercy and Grace. I pray everyone Is ok. Thanks to that baby and law enforcement officer. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Qual o desfecho 😢?
My mom sunk! She sunk! Shes in the water  ....... is someone in the car..........is someone in there?...... sigh* alright.... Is the door unlocked though?...... sigh*...... Lemme go back to my car...   Here kid, you do it....
😢😢😢😢😢
Conseguiram salvar a vida dela? Ela sobreviveu? Pobre menino, que desespero
Poor young boy but blessed sacred soul ❤
That child needs an award for getting help.Remaining calm, telling the police my mom is there having a seizure .
PRAY IN THE HOLY GHOST and ask the Lord to please deliver her from this situation IN THE MIGHTY NAME of Jesus Christ. Thank God for those men who helped her and her brave son.
I’m sorry it’s so stupid to call out to a sinking car to figure out if someone is in it WHNE YOU JUST GOT TOLD BY SOMEONE FHERE IS PEOPLE IN IT , just jump in and save them every second matters. Fucking hate stupid cops.
Live on grape drank and Chick O Sticks and you just might have a seizure or two.
What a stupid cop
W
Why he ain’t believe the boy still asking is somebody in there? Hurry up foo !!   ❤GLAD EVERYONE OK❤
Cop says “is anybody in there” while the whole car is almost submerged lmao
Bless this child besides the trauma of seeing his mom in the water he had the strength to save his mother and the help of this two good nature and brave men may the good Lord embrace this child and the dedication of these two heros God bless them in their path
i don’t know what’s the dramatics is in this video but i would have done the same thing to help my mom ❤
❤thank you Sir for stopping and helping them God almighty going to reward you the rest of the days of your life.
That poor little boy.
Poor little sweetheart, so worried about his mother how terrifying that must’ve been for him. I’m so thankful they got her out and it was him who saved his mother and the wonderful police officers do so much and are always there to help in any emergency situation.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I was amazed at how the boy was able to get help so fast for his mom he definitely saved his moms life good job to you and all who got her out😮😊
😢 God bless this boy for getting help to save his Momma..
🙌🏿 In His Son Holy Name 🙏🏿 It's Already Done
Meu Deus que agonia! Será que a mãe dele sobreviveu?
poor little mate. His mum had a seizure and crashed the car into the lake. Bless him in those efforts to the outcome. Gaawwddd!!
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
The cop should’ve reacted way faster. The son was obviously in pure panic mode, saying his mom was stuck in the car. The cop should’ve acted faster and just went straight to the car other than asking if somebody’s in the car when it’s buried underwater, some people just aren’t meant for, quick action thinking. But I guess good job
hears screaming "is somebody in there" after the kid said their mums trapped in the car, how dense can this cop be
Remember this next time you hear someone say ACAB
😢😢😢 espero que estejam bem e a salvo🙏🏻
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Lawd thanks for letting that cop be a kind one! Father bless him and his generations generously! Hallelujah ❤❤❤
That boy definitely saved his mama’s life
Thank Jesus
Graças a Deus....deu tufo certo
Not all cops are bad.
Lil one is a hero bc if he didn’t get out this whole outcome could have been devastating. Devastating enough that it happen😪
Women drivers man
She having a seizure he said first
Poor baby…😢 Is she okay?
Cop should of been faster didn’t wna get wet first
I'm so sorry, lots of health to you  ❤❤❤
Bogu hvala sto mu je Mama dobro🙏🍀
Thank God some one there for that young man. 😢
I'm so happy for that child and the man who saved her
Cop couldn't have moved any slower🤦
Actually, you don't. If you ring up and dont speak or if the call handler hears struggling, they will try their best to locate you and send police over.
bless th
A lot of people hate the police, but they never seems to hate these situations. 🥇
Que  bello chico Dios mio que momento  tan fuerte
Is there someone in there is the car unlocked !?! Boy if that ain’t your job checking I don’t know what is
I pray for your mom I just seen this
You were hearing her screaming and you still kept asking if someone was in there
Бедный ребёнок 😢❤
Shit didn't seem like the Cop didn't GAF to me.Walking and asking a question the kid answered when he was saying my mom is   having seizure. Thank God someone else was around I believe this cop seen Black and didn't give a damn. If white kids, white mom he would have went in Superman Mode. Really...😮😮😮😮
And trying to open door by handle???? Bro
Why was bro asking so much and not doing
Ура, я в первих рядах! Печальная лошадь хочет откинуть копита?
The fact he had to ask first was stupid, if someone is drowning or seizing in water DON'T FUCKIN' ASK IF SOMEONE IS THERE JUST HELP THEM.
❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏
Thank you Sir, Amen Amen Amen 🙏🙏🙏
oh that little boy were they able to save his mom
What an idiot!! Does this prick not speak English or what?! the boy was begging him to save his mom the whole time and he’s still standing there asking questions like he’s not sure if he really wants to get his shoes wet.
Is it just me or is that cop a bozo it took this idiot of a cop all this time just to rescue someone he taking his sweet time
Being a cop sometimes takes you way above your duties 🙏God bless you for all you do saving people ❤️💪👌💯
DÍOS TE BENDIGA HIJITO
I’m crying 😭
Thank God for a loving cop amen and amen and amen
Won’t see this blasted all over the media
Dumme frage renn hin schau nach und versuche so schnell wie möglich leben zu retten .
"good samaritan" thats literally his job
Who decided to film it though? That’s always my problem in believing these videos.
Wow. Scary stuff!!😮😢😢
toller Junge, das er gleich Hilfe holte!! kann die Familie stolz sein auf den Kleinen!! Ich hoffe es geht allen gut da Helfer ziemlich flott gekommen sind könnte es nochmal gut ausgegangen sein!!
Hanya dapat minta tolong,kerana kekuatannya masih kecil😢.,yang menolong harus diberi penghargaan.
Que todos estejam bem garoto deus os abencoe
❤ thank god
How is she doing?
You go DJ, God's got ya'll. Such a Hero❤❤❤❤❤💔💔🙏🙏🙏 love you guys
I feel bad for all the kids and people who have experienced this and even lost their parents. R.I.P they will still be with you, always next to you :) i hope that kids mom is okay tho. Bless his soul for  building up the courge for having to leave his mother to find help for her. Bless that woman too. I hope shes alive and greatful for her child 🙏❤ Amen!
The boy is a true hero 👏 🙌 💙 ❤️ 💪
What a brave child thank God she was saved ....But wait, why are there pictures of this tragedy? How was this rescue filmed even under the water. Was this a cop??
Wow!! The thought of the outcome going the other way brings tears to my eyes as well as I listened to a son of a mother witness something so scary. This experience possibly has inspired something inside the young man, Pitt it in the atmosphere ❤❤❤❤
Bless them all Bless that Officer for his heroism. God placed him at the right place at the right time
Thank you lord for the son being with his mom. And then the good Samaritan in the right place at the right time.  I pray the mom survived 🙏
🧑👱😢😢😇🙏🌞🕊️❤️❤️❤️
The cop is so slow
That poor child was running off of pure adrenaline !
How racist of that white cop to save her life
Aww he said momma ....mommma
school fight ahh body cam
cop took his GOD DAMN time
MUST be such a tragic moment for that poor child to see that
Ну очень странно снимают видео, вместо того чтоб быстрей спасти, человека.
The boat thought it could float 😢
“Is somebody in there?” he JUST told you
Is somebody in there 😮 after the boy said his mom is in there having a seizure? Unbelievable 😮😮😮
😮
The kid said she’s in the water so what’s the cop do? Slowly walk up to the car asking if she’s in there
Stop arguing, Jesus loves you
O mylanta ❤❤❤❤
😢
STOP ASKIND DAMN QUESTIONS AnD SAVE HER FRICKING MOM
Why is he asking INSTEAD OF VISUALLY CHECKING??the boy was very clear saying she was in there!!
Poor kiddo.... I'm so sorry honey ;-;
Liam savin the day
Lol that cop wasn't rushing at all.
"Is somebody in there?"  *I hear you kid but I don't want to get wet for nothing*   Good and smart son.
Something similar happened to me as a kid…this will scar him for the rest of his life. Why was the mother driving? Does she not realize she was putting her sons life at risk everytime she got behind that steerwheel with her son in the car? I can still taste the blood and feel the paind and smell the smoke. Me and my two sisters were with my mom when she had a seizure and hit a tree in front of a river. Everyone was unconscious and i was the first one to wake up, ironically i was the most hurt i had a ruptured spleen and my lip was split open. I crawled to the road and screamed for help until a woman who happened to be a nurse came running. I think i was 8 years old. I’m 32 now and still feels like it happened not that long ago
Us men are so brave we allways risk live everyday
WHY IS THE COP ASKING HIM OMG JUST GO
Wow thanks to God this turned out in her life being saved, and her kids. Thanks Jesus.
That cop had zero urgency
✨☄️✨
I'm sorry but the camera needed to be stable while the the officers tried to retrieve the mother. I saw nothing but blurry water. Did I they rescue the mother? Was she alive?
Having seizures and allowed to drive?  My lord.
❤❤❤❤
The boy that could never be grounded.
Seizures sucks!! That's why ppl w seizes are not pose to drive😢
Kudo's to this young man as well! He qas ahle to swim out and get his mother the help she needed. He must have been so scared. Way to go buddy!
Kudo's to our FIRST Responders!!  Thank all of you for your dedicated services!!
One thing a son gonna do is protect his mom
“ is anybody in there? “ Wtf dude GET IN THE FUCKING WATER!!!
Yes folks, don't defund the cops.
I know police officers are probably not supposed to freak out in situations like this but I mean the kid explains to you while freaking out what happened you and him drive down there together and yet still take the time to repeatedly ask if someone is in there I mean thank goodness they saved her life but who knows what would of happened if he waited any longer
Y was the cop so calm at the beginning
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Why is she driving if she’s prone to seizures!?! 😭😭😭
He's not moving fast enough 😮
That’s brave bc must be alligators 🐊 in there
🙏🏾💜
Мужщина ангел хранител, неровнодушен ,спасибо👍🇺🇿👍удачи тебе мальчик и маме❤
That poor baby boy 😢😢 thank GOD for him.
Great man this is beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️ respect
Is she in there???  WHAT DO YOU THINK?!?!  Letting the kid scream his lungs out that are already out of air to tell him "yes she is in there help her".  Am I the only one who noticed a tone of superiority coming from the way he speaks and his half heartedness in doing this dead.  I bet if it was his wife in there he wouldn't ask so many questions and jump right in there
😱
Just another Racist Cop.   Won't see this in the woke media
nice boy and cop, with good person
Brave kid, a cop, and a good Samaritan  ❤
Son, you saved your Momma❣️🥰❣️ You are my hero!!!
The cop is a stupid ass ! “Is someone in there?” Well no shit
Those "evil whyte supreme police" sure gave it to the black family didn't they?... By saving their effin life!!! Damn you liberal media for making the stupified masses despise the police m
That cop definitely hesitant to go into the lake
Damn this cop was taking aaaaaaall his time
Коп красава!
Thats exactly the reason why I forfait my drivers license. Got epilepsy since more than 10 years and tried several meds, but never was 100% free of seizures (Grand Mal).
Thank God that baby was able to get out to go get help!!!
Dameeeeewe😢😢😢😢😢😢😢YOULL GONE TAKE ME OUT WITH THIS VIDEO😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤.
Poor baby omg😮
You're truly a great man to save his mother blessings 😊
Amen. Thank you, Jesus 😇 smart boy!
Is somebody in there? Really? Damn you're smart
Great job! You saved your mother's life and these are the officers I love!
Cop: *hands her a fruit punch* Mom: .............
Aww bless him, he god boy saving his mum
😢❤
God bless that young man 🙏🏽💙🫶🏾
Un rescate ahi es casi in posible.
Could the Cop have taken any longer to get moving? Jesus
Omg!!
OMG 😱
I pray she is okay. ❤ 🙏 a very good son.
Damn that’s scary being that I have them too. Blessed this little boy and his mother
Il faut SORTIR par le PARE BRISE ARRIERE qui est toujours le dernier à couler sous l'eau. On peut le casser avec les tiges métalliques tenant les appuis-têtes.
Без телефона в руке можно было бы действовать быстрее.
When he said mum, mum, "mama, please", wow i lost it. He was still yelling to his mum to hold on.
"is somebody in there?" LITERALLY HER KIDS JUST FUCKING TOLD YOU I CANNOT WITH THIS
Не снимать на телефон надо а бежажать спасать людей! Душераздирающий крик мальчика оставь уже эту камеру...
Stories like this never get out. White Americans helping Black Americans. Thank you to the good officer and citizen 🙏🏾
Amen!❤
Cop was in no hurry to get in that water. Double checking whether there was anyone in there. W but only just barely.
Как малчик вы брался если все закрыто 😮
"iS soMebOdy in TheRE?"  The kid LITERALLY SAID IT WAS....
I'm glad they all rallied together and saved her life. You guys are all heroes!
Omh 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Thank god he was able to flag them down… he saved her
Father please fully heal this woman amen
What a brave boy
Damn
O Lord the fear in his voice
Cop wasn't urgent at all when he got there
God bless them
Tous les commentaires qui parlent de téléchargement sont bloqués et invisibles 😮😮😮😮😮
🥹😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😇
That cop acted with 0 urgency, wtf was he even doing?
كذالك هيه أيضاً صرخت أطفال أهل غزة على امهاتهم وابائهم
Notice how slow the cop moves then it cuts and a civilian is helping probably ran and jumped in while the cop waddled back to his car for a punch. You're better off with a stranger on the road than a cop giving any urgency to help
Poor kid oh no
God bless him hero
LIRD HAVE MERCY!!🙏🏽❣️
Bless the officer and this family.
The boy saved his mom
I saw a monion toy😢
Oh, my goodness! The bravery it took for everyone involved. I'm so glad the officer took him seriously and got her out of there. They literally saved her life. I can't imagine.
Prayer said for this family - my heart breaks for this young man. This is a trauma even though his mom survived I just think this will affect his mental health ❤ may he receive the support to heal from this  They’re all heroes!!!
🥹🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️❤️
As a mother his cries broke me , you did well son and Thank you to all that rescued that woman 👏🏾👏🏾🤝🏾.
Bless God for people in their heart to be human and help,, Many Blessings
He’s so brace by getting out of the car that’s why we we get teach Dean school why we should get out of a window when there’s someone in the water in a car, but if we didn’t know that we would’ve drowned and he made a really hard decision on trying to say do I leave my mum do I help my mum do I go to the police or help? My mum?
Was that a minion
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
It had to be a Charger bruh 😭😭😭
Is somebody in there? No shit.
My heart just sank 😢
the son was so brave threw this
😮😮😮😮😮
I had a seizure and crashed down a hill, it really messed up my life and the gov doesnt help me at all, i had just been diagnosed with epilepsy a year prior.
Wow thank you so much
“I’ve got a punch” for your wife?
That baby was go get his mama out that car himself if they took another second to get there he was at the window😢👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The cop asking to the car if It was anybody in there after the kids told him they sunk got me real mad bro
They wouldn’t have done the same for him
Corajoso e esperto
"She's having a seizure, she's stuck, she's in the water" my guy in 3 seconds gave more information than any adult ever could while having a panic attack
☺️❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢
The officer cannot swim? Instead he jump in, he asking is anyone there.😮
He could have moved a little quicker 🙄
This happened in my town!
Fuck is somebody in there wonder if kid was white would cop just jump in
Bro asking to much questions help the  kid
God Bless Him❤
Слезы из глаз, сердце разрывается, как ему страшно за маму!
If this is police officer, why didn't he radio for help?
FYI the car front seat head rest are made to strike the windows and break it
That poor baby. He did so good though! I’m so glad his mom is okay!
なんでそうなった
OMG! I can't...I'm almost in tears. God bless that child and the brave men who rescued mom. Heroes for sure.
❤❤❤
Heroe
Bravo!!!
Dodge Charger was just trying to go back to its natural habitat.
The boy's love and the officer's dedication changed the world that day. wow.
🙏 DIOS ❤️ LOS ❤️ BENDICE 💚 DESDE 💕 AHORA ❤️‍🩹 Y ✨ PARA 🤗 SIEMPRE 🙏❤️❤️💚💕❤️‍🩹✨🤗♥️❤️💚💕❤️‍🩹✨🤗♥️❤️💚💕❤️‍🩹✨🤗♥️❤️💚💕❤️‍🩹✨🤗♥️❤️💚
His mom's Hero
That cop did not give a huck about saving that woman. His sense of urgency was zero!!! Thank TMH for the other people who stepped in.
Y police react so slow ,  cop expecting reply from a women with seizures in upside down car in a water 🤷🏼‍♂️. Just few more minutes it would have been too late. Brave boy❤. Protect your families and trusted once.
Woman:👩🏾screams ow my foot, i cant move  Pig:👮‍♀️ is anyone in there?
Oh her sweet son...he did so well. ❤
color and gender, when these 2 met  heHOOO
Kid in water screaming mom & come help her . Cop: “ is she in there “ while standing and watching for a few seconds -_-
a charger with like 700 hp isnt a good family car its too much for most of us too
le méchant policier blanc a sauvé la vie de la mama
It's still fhaq the law
This was one special police officer, who was truly there to protect, serve, and save.👍🏾
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 made me cry
Да брось ты камеру, и Спасай!!! 🤦‍♀️
Just know if the boy had not been there the police officer did not seemed concerned about helping this women at all.
I commend your courage bravery and mental fortitude young man❤
Stupid people, the child said his mother is having a seigneur.people don't listen wow
Wtf box jumps in cop somebody in there
the cop is a little slow
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
So traumatic for him 😢
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
you shouldn't be allowed to drive if you are known to experience sudden medical episodes
Да будет вам уроком американцы у нас в России нет чужих детей
I can see a mann helping before the police mann ,the police mann is very very slow 😳 and the child is scared and the police mann just say,come on puppy... 😳 What a strange way to act...
Of course they’re driving dodge chargers
Why is the cops standing there yelling at someone in there? They're drowning you f*******
God bless this beautiful officer.
eh, women driving... and again it took a man to save the woman. Tsk
Why is the cop just standing there going "hello? Is somebody in there?" After a child just spawned at a freeway crying to help him pointing at a car obviously in the water? Did the cop really think it was a prank or something? Why was he just sitting there hesitating doubting? The water was waste deep even the lil kid was in there helping before the cop was.
Amen.❤ Thank you. Lord.🙌
He jumped in before the cop..  Thank God for you Child and Thank You Officer for Helping ❤ God always send help right to time..
Not the hellcat
." Is she in there?.. She cannot answer the question she drowning man! I bet he didn't want his uniform wet.
How can you film in such a moment?
R i p
Why was the cop so fkn slow istg 🤬
I log the help
such a brave boy and good cop ❤
If you have chronic seizures all time. You not supposed to drive or have a driving license. This is why.
Bro asking is someone in there like she hears him underwater
😑Police took his damn slow time getting to that car.
The cop didn’t even run to the water what are you on all about his bravery wtf… 0 urgency
Странное поведение полицейского. В нашей стране любой человек бросился бы в воду для спасения людей, а не спрашивал есть ли там кто.
es como los videos de los caballitos o los venaditos cuando piden ayuda.
Cop took his time. "Is she in there?"
Thank you Officer!
how did that even happen
Prayers for my classmate
Pobrecito su niño, bien afligido 😢
There under the water and this cop is standing in the road yelling is anybody in there when the boy already said it was somebody in there smh
Why on earth was this poor child being videoed at this terrible time of his life?
That cop was like... black woman in the car? Hmmmm idk if I wanna get wet. Oh shit civilians are here, I got a punch hang on guys imma commin!
Omg this was hard to watch but I am glad the child went for help and the cop took action
Cop slow as hell 💀💀
😭😭
You have 1 minute to get out of the car. Not time to grab your personal belongings dial 911 and if your planning I opening the doors right away make sure your the only one in the vehicle.
How it (clearly) ended ?…
This cop is asking if shes in there...🙄 That baby was telling you she is in there and she had a seizure!!
This boy made me cry. To many children their mom is all they have .
That cop was useless. His efforts were casual and best. He sounded like he was just about to go to lunch and this got in the way. America has the worst trained police in the developed world
Omg, this child rescued his mom. Thank You Lord, This was his mama, he knew.
Cop took his sweet Jesus time didn’t he?
Idk why but it enraged me the fact that he kept saying "is someone in there?" Like man a kid is not gonna ask you to save an empty car
OMG does she have a history of seizures? If so she should not be driving
Award that boy, he did the right thing during what is likely the most terrifying moment of his life.  Despite being young, he acted quickly and saved his mother’s life.  A hero in the making
Reason why I hate automatic electric windows and doors.
I like how all cops save a lot of people’s life but they’re always just like. Is there somebody in there? Hello are you there when there’s somebody clearly dying?
Cop has more urgency when getting his morning donut. Dude straight slow walking.
Wait wait wait !!! I thought white cops killed black people. This video must be fake...
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mi niñooo!!  Ke fuerte eres. Espero mama haya salido bien. Señor ayuda🙏🙏🙏🤍🤍🤍🤍🇮🇨
God bless this child and his mom
😢💙🩵🙏
❤HEROS❤ That young child was SO brave and got his mom the help she needed. Thanks to all that helped. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
God bless the kid for experiencing that. Thankful help got there in time.
Why is she driving around with a child, or even at all, having a seizure disorder? wtf.
Is someone in there? Meanwhile kid saying my mama is in there…
She's in the water help her.... Ok ... is there anyone in there?
Thank u, my God forgive good people that help others ❤❤
It's like the cop didn't even believe him when he's in the water trying to get his mom out of the car I would have went jumping in that s***
Just another cop not knowing what to do these guys are so untrained that I don't understand how they have jobs
What type a question is that? Is she in there?🤦🏽
so racist
Is somebody in there? Like bro I swear
The blood of Jesus!!!🔥🙏🏻
Thanks 🙏🏿 that she is rescued..the emergency response was on time.. I hope she is ok.
Many prayer sent, loads. Teresa*tree
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Bravos both that young boy that be ame a true warrior and the officer staying calm in tje ga e of adversity .
Is somebody in there wooow 😂
These beautiful Angels helping this lady who had a seizure and her wonderful son
Was she in my her phone?
Какой стресс для ребёнка! Хоть бы не остались последствия! 😢 Я очень рада, что геройские мужчины смогли спасти маму этого умного ребёнка!! ❤❤
Poor child but what a strong lil guy saved he’s mother +
She can't park there
But the cop sucks
Why did he ask the child is the car unlocked???? Lord have mercy
Omg this poor baby! This gave chills. Trying his hardest to help his momma.  Felt like an eternity, damn!!
BRAVO to all that helped this family. Without you they wouldn't be alive today.
Let’s not forget the 16 yr old daughter. She saved her mom too
God bless him
Praise God for this young boy to describe HIS MOM HEALTH SITUATION!!! GOD BLESS HIM AND HIS MOM. THANK GOD A POLICE WAS AT THE RIGHT PLACE, AT THE RIGHT TIME. HALLELUJAH 🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️👀😇🚒😭😭👍🏽👍🏽
As someone who has seizures this is why I refuse to drive
Damn, how bout a little hustle to that step, OfFiCeR
I got goose bumps i felt his pain that poor child ❤God bless her he told you she was in there tf
Thank you guys! You are the honest police men I will always love. Keep doing yous boys. Because if you ever save me I owe you unlimited beers🥲🍻❤️
Thank God🙏🏾🙏🏾
cop with 30000 ping
Jesus thank goodness her son was there you are a hero young man you saved your moms life great explanation may god continue to bless you it’s going to be special
That poor child. So traumatic, yet he did whatever it took to save his mom. ✨💖✨
🙏🏾
God bless everyone that was there. Everyone is an angel of God. ❤
nice charger i aint gon hold
Boy: My mum is in the car drowning whilst having a seizure Officer: 🧍is anybody in there
🥺 he was so scared
holy crap. this kid is incredible. give him an award for his social awareness
When I seen the original video it pissed me off. The cop literally was walking taking his time to get to the car. He took his time putting the child in the back of a police car first, No sense of urgency. They edited it out of this video for a reason.
Jesus these rescuers could not have been any more casual….
THIS BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES PRAYING ALL IS WELL
Yo Daniel Kaluyah that’s how it’s done,
The policeman sleeping
Yeah I wouldn’t of known what to do in that situation. Takes balls to run AWAY from the situation and get the help needed and bro found a cop too
I almost didnt see this what avkid plus what a cop
What i want to know is,did she survive 😢
I'm glad they're both safe. We have a similar local incident where a mother had a heart attack or something while parking the car with her daughter next to her, she accidentally stepped on the gear and crashed right into the lake in front of the parking lot, a passerby recorded a video while a few guys jumped in trying to help..  the daughter made it out of the car through the door, it made the car sink faster afterwards, the guys were still swimming on the way to the rescue, unfortunately the daughter went back into the car after realizing her mom is still inside with her seatbelt on.. the door closed shut after she went back in due to water pressure, as the guys were trying to break the windows.. sadly both of em drowned because the car sunk almost in the blink of an eye after the daughter got out the first time..
Thank God for People Like This Man  He Risks His Own Life to Help Others  A True Hero !!!
So again the police are doing outstanding work. Wonder if the occupants and her family want to defund the police and limit water to farmers. Without either of these groups this woman would have perished and her kids grown up without a mother. Police are amazing, jumped right in and got to work, same for the farmers on the science as well. Thanks so much.
That precious child and the officer who helped.
cop sure took his damn time
I love how they have zero rush to get to her. What are they doing ?!?!?!
That’s what I call “protect and serve .” Great guy.
Thank God, she was saved
That cop should have been moving a lot faster or is that just me
Why is this cop asking if someone is in there go check and see dummy
Oh, bless that baby's heart Lord!  Thank you, so much for sparing their lives.
Humanity❤
God will bless this child ! You saved your mother’s life !❤😊
Poor kid was so scared, but so brave
Is anyone in there.  The kid YES MY MOM
Women cant Drive
🫡
Bruh the police forgot the boy already told him that he was in the water. The police:Is she in water?😊
the cop is soo guilty and stupid why did you ask if anybody is here the child was saying that his mom is in the car what is a stupid cop
How many times the poor kid gotta tell them 'YES MY MOM IS IN THE CAR'? Cop deaf???
Omg, please tell me that that sweet boy and his momma made it? And if so can we send to them? Would love to help that boy and his momma out.
Couldn't the officer move a little quicker? The boy had to tell him so many times :( even I felt his anxiety 😔
Why are tgey driving knowing they have this problem which can come out anytime?!!
Aww this made me cry 😢😢😢
Seizure and driving are not good to be together 😅
God bless them
Those 2 men definitely saved her life that officer was asking is somebody in there when the boy clearly stated that she was. If it weren't for the 2 men helping she would be a gonner bcuz that officer didn't seem to want to get in the water.
“Is somebody in there?” As the kid is yelling his mama is in there… get a clue, officer
“Is somebody in there” I’m yes brother his mom. He repeatedly told you this 😅😅
Thank God they were able to save her.We all have to watch each other's back.❤
y was this guy filming
God bless
People that have seizures should not be issued a drivers license. My Daughter has seizures and she drives. It’s just not safe for anyone.
Відео знімати та питати, чи є хто там, приємніше, ніж рятувати..
Mom lived!?
That cop... Do we have to?
Women and driving..
The man is just standing there asking is anybody in there after being told there is somebody in there is very distasteful!
Anybody remember when they said they want to defund the police
Qué momento tan triste , me salieron mis lagrimas y mis ganas de abrazar tanto al Niño como al señor qué ayudó a salvar a su adorada madre  Gracias a Dios todos están bien  ❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏😪😪😪
Although this officer may not have wanted to save her....he pushed passed whatever his ideology is and did what God put us here to do and that's love one another... it's only one race and that's human race!💙
God  Bless  the officer!
Cop doing too much damn talking. DO YOUR JOB
That kid 😢is so traumatized.....
その後どうなりましたか？
This obsession with videoing. Sometimes videos can waiy , so act fast. I know you need evidence but seconds matter.
Stop filming
Oh my God! Thank goodness she was saved. What an amazing son she has.❤
How is he dramatic
The police man could not care less
Zufällig ne Kamera dabei die das ganze filmt ? Hm
Took the cop a bit to react...
I'm glad everyone made great job for those involved in rescuing her thank you jesus for having angel's available
Is the car unlocked 💀
This officer needs to show some level of urgency. Dude is asking "is someone in there" when the kid keeps telling him his moms inside.
This poor lil ome....
The cop is slow as a sloth, asking stupid questions. Just go dive into the damn Lake
The sense of urgency from this officer isn't present.
Uh boy good bless you
And people say there is no god. The timing of all of this us impeccable.
You shouldn’t be fucking driving if you have seizures and can kill others or your own damn kids. Shit parent putting those kids in that kind of situation
How she fall into a pond 😂
OMG! This had tears in my eyes😢
🛡️🙌🏼🎖️
The boys definitely scared of his mom
I hate to critique a good outcome.... but the officer was on the slower side when seconds count.
Brave young kids!!!!
Of course its a dodge charger
God is good
A true hero and the  officer is one as well God bless them ❤❤
Semoga kita selalu mendapat pertolongan seperti ini dimanapun kita berada,❤
I wonder how the boy got out if there was no open windows and the doors were locked. Was it just the pressure of the water that made it hard to open? I didn't think it was deep enough for that to happen.
YES SOMEONES IN THE FUCKING WATER HES SAYING SHE SUNK JESUS
That cop waited way to fucking long
Andpeople think our country is racist.  This video proves it's not.
Don't let a body cam bring you joy.  This cop is trash.   He questioned a wet child's validity 2 times then saw the car and questioned it again.  Wtf
Gator lake
Why is someone filming this.
God Bless 😮😢😮😢❤❤❤❤
I feel bad for where he had to go through. That child will be a strong man in the future as he is already.
Amazing, Amen
That deserves a Get Out of Punishment Free card for life
Poor buddy! That's traumatic. So thankful for her recovery especially for his sake.
Is that cop stupid
Poor baby 🤦🏽‍♂️💔🙏🏽
Somehow, there's always time to film. Sick of these bullshit videos.
Y’all see that gator.   They made it out just in time.  😮
❤❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Thank God!😢❤
“ is somebody in there?” Bro literally said his mom was in there like 3 times😂
The kid knows because she had one before she shouldnt be driving nevermind herself she could have killed people
El niño estaba muy preocupado
God bless you.  SOOO CALM!!! I WANT you if I ever need help!!!❤❤❤❤
"Is somebody in there?" Like where, hiding at the bottom of the lake?   Like she's gonna pop out and scare him?  🙄
Wow praise God.
QUÉ HERÓICO ESTÉ NIÑITO LINDO...Y QUE VALIENTES HÉROES LOS QUE A TIEMPO RESCATARON A LA MAMITA DEL NIÑITO
That kid and cop are true heroes the both need metals god bless them both
shouldn’t be allowed to drive if you’re susceptible to seizures, especially with children
I can't drive because I have epilepsy. This is a nightmare scenario. The kid is lucky to be alive
Not to be pedantic but that's the cops job. They're not Samaritans in the legal sense. They have a duty to act
Whats the  Psyche behind killing your family members?? Why does this seem so normal in America
Little boy is a hero as are the men who helped ❤
Poor kid trying tell the cop his mother sin a drowning car but he had to ask “is there anyone in there”
Cop was too slow, he let 2 other bystanders pull her out. He’s not a public servant. He should be ashamed.
Stupid cop asking if some one is in there  Human can't talk underwater.
Why keep asking the same question about her being in there to the child?! Did he not believe him he was soaking wet himself and clearly he wasn’t the driver
The cop was def stuck on slow mode…
I just hope the media can show this side of America a lot more than the things that divide people. 😢❤🎉
God will send help when you need it. Thank you Jesus
Dios ME los bendiga a  su niño y a ese hombre!!! Le salvo la vida a su madre!!!
Kid is a king
This slow cop….
definitely don't want to lose your mom at that age.  Even a mom that is crippled.. or half paralyzed is sooo much better then no mom.
He is telling you she is in there dumb a$$
Poor kid. Breaks my heart to see him have to go through something like that.
Is the car unlocked.... Maybe we should wait and see if she gets out.
Why on my birthday
Omg 😢god bless this is amazing humanity
That cop was really hoping he didn’t actually have to work 😂😂
Only a dumb good ole boy from Texas would waste time calling from the shore to a car with the front end submerged, “is somebody in there?” after being told by a child that “she’s having a seizure, she’s in there!” What was he debating, whether it was worth getting his shoes wet?
In Jesus name I hope she made it out alive. God bless the little boy.
Thank goodness someone else was there. If it was the kid and cop alone, they wouldn’t have helped her in time. Cop was dragging his feet like crazy. Didn’t wanna get his equipment wet.
Thank God for His Mercy & Grace so the little boy could get medical help & get his mom to safety. Amen.
God bless and protect these people. Ameen
MAY GOD JESUS CHRIST PROTECT HEAL and SAVE our beloved once and all of us 🙏🏾 AMEN 🙏🏾✝️
😢🙏🏼❤️
He must’ve been hella scared, but the adrenaline & motivation to save his mama helped him find a guardian angel 🙏🏿
Thanking god for those who helped
She would have had to been in the water for quite some time! Does anyone Know if she survived?
It’s crazy how the kid is telling him his mom is in there and he’s asking and waiting for a response….. what an idiot
Girl: help! Cop: is somebody in there? No sir just practicing my exclamation skills 🤦‍♂️
Was that a snake they threw off her?
Asking the car if anyone's in there ain't gonna rescue the drowning victims any faster 🙄
The desperation in that kids voice, heart braking. Thank hod for him, he saved her life
Она умерла? В итоге
Oh my heart! I can’t imagine what that poor child was feeling. He saved his Momma ❤❤
Poor boy he was so 😨
Praise God for all who were involved for he rescue and especially for her child
Meu Deus...
He will probably always be a good boy from now on! Poor child! Good job young smart strong brave boy!
It wasn't her time miraculous@ thank you Jesus for putting these brave men and son!
Aww bless him
He told this cop she was in there.
LORD JESUS my heart went out to that baby boy immediately ! Thank You JESUS for his quick thinking.🙏🏽
Thank God that she was rescued blessings to her and her son and all the rescuer's 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This cop is taking his time
يا الاهي 😢 مجرد فكرة فقدان الام هي بمثابة فقدان كل اطرافك ونضرك وسمعك لا الوم هذا الطفل فهو يعرف جيدا قيمة الام في هذه الحياه😢❤
GOD bless everybody.
“ is the car unlocked? “ IF IT WAS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT BY NOW DONT YA THINK?
Everyone involved to rescue the mom from drowning are the HEROES! The boy loves his mom and the men helping are awesome heroes
I don't know!!!!!! this time of video!!
please folks... buy a mini emergency tool. I know the woman can't use it because seizure but i always have one on my keys. It can break the glass like butter (Already tested on a junkyard)  I have another two on my sun visor on my car.. if i drive into the water or i can't out and the car is on fire. And of course on my keys for others who need help
That water looks like its got a couple reptiles
He was relatively calm though exhausted after having to escape a sinking car and run for help not knowing if he will get to talk to his mom again.
And yet we don’t see this on national news because life was saved not taken.
NO ES DRAMA. NO JODAN. FUE REAL. DIOS MÍO GRACIAS A ESA GRAN PERSONA 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Why is he asking a panicked child a load of questions? Just get out to the car and see for yourself!
"Is somebody in there?" Its like hoping someone just gonna come out from that water😂
He said she was in there already
Glory to Jesus that help came
I wonder does she have a history of having seizures if so no one should be allowed to srive period. But to the futs snd the policeman thanks for sacing her life. Well done!
It’s okay liam
Hoefficer over here  asking if someone inside while they underwater. 🤦🏽
Outstandingly  DONE.  THANK YOU❤❤
Amen
ma il telefono in mano?
Good lawd someone was there to help her and her child. Thank you for being there for this family. ❤😊
Promote this gentleman officer for rescuing this woman life. ❤️
О Господи спаси ❤ бедный ребёнок, молодчина ❤
Pobre niño que angustia, espero que su mamita esté  bien.
😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤
Now this is what cops are supposed to do. Not judge and be racist.  I 👏👏👏👏👏👏 you gentlemen for helping this person and her.  🙏🏻🙏🏻
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Poor lil boy having to go thru that. His brave actions saved his mama.
"is somebody in there?" the cop is dumb the little boy is literally begging for help!!
What a hero! His cries were so painful to hear. I'm so glad he was able to get help for his mom and that all those involved were willing and able to help rescue the mom. ❤
Why did the police officer stand there for a minute asking? Is there someone in there?😭😭😭
😢😇❤️
🥺🥹
What brand bodycam?
Omg that poor kid !!  Thank God for those  men ❤❤❤ !!
She's probably still driving and having seizures
Oh my, the poor distress this boy is in, my heart hurt for him, so happy his mum was rescued, he did well to get out what he did in the midst of panic and crying and the people that saved her are heroes.
Hope all is well🤦🏿‍♀️😢🙏🏿
🥺♥️
If white police officers hated people because of race, this one wouldn't have worked so hard to save her life. Please remember the reality of the situation. Good son, too.
😢😢
What a heroic young man and officer! GOD BLESS THEM BOTH!😊😊😊😊
That lil boy saved his moms life these men are heroes ... Hoping all is well with all of them ❤
🕊 ✝️✝️💞💞🙏🙏💞💞✝️✝️🕊
Clearly someone's in there dude ur gonna have to get wet today kid told you why u still asking...bravo kiddo u did good
Poor baby boy. He saved his mom
😢😢😢
notice how quick the little boy was to explain all the key information of the situation to the officer, between breaths
See how the cop isn’t rushing
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I hope his mum is okay , God bless you all for helping 🙏 😢😢❤❤❤
Actually I can't see anythin'...
This burned me man shiiiit hope family is all good now well done to all involved x
oh wow what a brave young man! way to go!
Omg how many times did the cop really have to ask this boy that was very clear about the situation, if someone is in the car 🙄
🥹
The black folk just love a v8 what can i say
I live in West Orange 🍊 Texas y’all were right by me
Oh hang on, let me just set up my phone so I can make some money selling this on YouTube
She shouldn’t be driving if she suffers seizures!
at least it’s not a dog
That officer did not want to go in that water. Thank god for the other people who jumped in
Thank goodness a police man was there to help get the lady out of car n get to shore . Didn’t say anything about how she was saved if someone performed CPR , but im guessing that happened and she survived that God 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I hope the little boys mom is okay
😮😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That is very sad😢
I would been like nah im not getting wet N1993r
High human values ​​are there for the boy regardless of race and ethnicity
Omg this poor baby... to witness this. Great job little man ❤
Whaf a good boy. Even though he was frightened he was getting help fir his mummy . Thankyou for saving her . I hope she has stopped driving now
God bless this courageous wonderful son who saved his mother’s life by getting the help she needed❤
Poor baby he was so worried for his moma  I hope they all served 🙏🙏
New childhood trauma unlocked. Hope they are all doing great!
That kiddo has a future in firefighting/ EMS or Police. Can't teach that type of thing. He has it.
Dont fucking drive distracted especially with your kids in the car remember other people have their kids and loved ones incthei cars too mom is horrible for that no idea how lucky she is having that tough ass kid for a son
THE BOY AND POLICE THOUGHT FAST. THE POLICE DOING CPR UNTIL PARAMEDICS ARRIVED. THEY BOTH DESERVE A MEDAL FOR THERE ACT OF BRAVERY.
God bless you sweetheart ❤you are our hero😢…you & tye others
Can someone tell me why he still yelled if someone was in the car when he was told there was someone in there? I feel like those could have been precious time wasted but maybe there is something i dont know
Are those question always a requirement before saving someone that is obviously about to die?
Some folks be bad ass!  Thank you.
That cop had no sense of urgency.
Bless his heart! Scared to death but still ran and was screaming for help! Thats courage! 🎉💖💖💖💥🏅🏆
I hope his mom is doing well and I hope this brave young son goes on to have a happy and successful life.
Ofc it’s a charger
Make America healthy again
So scary.
Did she survive, and if she did is she well?
He sure taking his sweet time
This made me cry, one of my biggest fears, my God, thank God she was safe
This is why I will never buy a Tesla.
That young man was so incredibly brave to get help for his Mama instead of staying and risking them both. He saved his Mama's life! If I were a billionaire, that young man would be going to YALE
"oh come on hop in" cop was on point aint ask no questions
If there was a picture of "remain calm" it'd be this guy
Blessings ❤
That cop doesn’t want to get wet 😅😅 hence ask a ridiculous questions “is somebody in there? 😅😅 and kids repeating “save mom” 🤦‍♂️
I hope he gets therapy. He and the Good Samaritans saved his mother. 🙏🏾🙏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤️❤️
🙌🏽🙏🏽
GOD BLESS THEM ALL!COPS AND FAMILY. How brave that little boy was to try to save his mother. ❤
Graças à Deus que tudo está bem.  Deus abençoe sempre todos esses anjos de Deus.
Of course is dodge drivers
And the MSM is no where to be found.
😢😢😢😢💙💙💙💙
No calls to defund the police? How about comments on 'systematic racism'?
Him saying “is somebody in there” after the boy said his mother was in there repeatedly was pissing me off
God's timing of sending the right help at just the right moment.
🙌🙌🙌 Peace and💚
We need all cops to have that kind of fortitude and compassion like this cop 💯
Is anybody in there? What the fuck
No one can here is someone in there?.
Noone can here u scream someone in there?
Holy crap This is the slowest cop ever need to get his butt in gear
Love
😮911😮
Good people doing great things
That boy makes me cry . He’s so desperate to help her.
OMG The desperation in that child's eyes.. 😢😢😢
Благодарю добрых,отзывчивых людей за спасение утопающих !!! РЕСПЕКТ!!!❤❤❤
That cop was in no hurry
The only reason you got to fear the police is if you do something illegal. These people wake up and put their lives on the line to protect the innocent .. not the guilty
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🤎🤎🤎
What a hero You are the best kid in the world saving his mom he love his mom all his heart
The cop was expecting to hear a response from the mother by asking, "Is somebody in there?"😂
How wonderful. ❤
Omg 😮😢 poor babyboy
Ngl that cop pisses me off "is anyone in there" dude, the little man already told you 3x
It really sucks that these video uploaders provide zero context, and zero resolution.  Why do yall subscribe to these idiots?  I mean, they don't even pay their commentors for their work..........? Hello?!?! McFly?!?!?!
Бедный мальчик,  такую психотравму получил! Господи, спаси и сохрани всех автомобилистов!
Heroes
Thank God above the mom made it! And her little son was so brave.
It aimt even a samaritan.. its her son—
What if dude is just looking at it and says “ ion wanne get wet” and just leaves
Kid if you happen to see this you are not only a hero, but more importantly you are one incredible son! Took a lot of courage to leave your mother to seek help! And to ppl hating on the cop you never rush things in life/death scenarios bc every mistake can lead to a terrible outcome. Staying calm and completing the mission is the right thing to do!
About like a cop, all they good at doing is barking orders.
The fact he said is anyone in there? While it’s underwater is crazy
How did this story end? How are the boy and the mom?❤
he looks and sounds like hes younger than 11.
God bless you sir and the kid that saved his mom.
How did this happen?
Thought we didn’t need cops
“Is somebody in there” YEAH SOMEONE IS DROWNING UNDERWATER AND THEY CAN HEAR THAT…
the cop did barely anything, thank god there’s other people around to help
Why that cop asking the dumb question of is anyone in there?  Obviously that's why the kid crying
I hope there would be better system for children because it should be free to give the boy a theraphy after this! And i hope he also got an medal for his braveness of saveing his mom!!
It could be just me and call me judgmental, but I feel as though if you are diagnosed with a medical condition like seizures or something like that, you should not be driving! God bless this little boy and the cops and the people that saved her, but I honestly think that there should be a restriction to people that have medical traditions like that to be driving because that’s like risking their own life and then somebody else’s life like she could’ve killed her kids accidentally because she had a medical condition. 😢😢
Out come ?
I mean good kid but any credit to the first responder like 😂
What a shitty cop. Instead of rushing to save the person he was already told was in the car he took the time to ask stupid questions.
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉qui bom ter em cotrado ajuda😊😮
My momma sunk!! Is someone in their? Yeah my momma in there! is SOMEONE in there? 😐😐
May God help us all pray for one another. 🙏✝️🙏
Incredible. I hope the woman is doing allright
I love to see the work of God's hand guiding them all who helped save her life 🙏 Bravo 👏 🙌 to her young son
Jesus he took his sweet time getting to the car didn't he?
Con camara acuatica y toda la cosa. No venia preparado cierto?
Maybe instead of talking they should have helped immediately.
🙏🏻💪🏻❤️
So glad he was there to help his mom
Helden ❤
Deputy dog didn't want to get wet. Took his bloody time jumping in didn't he.
The look on that boys face breaks my heart
Kid did good!! He got out, he found help, he communicated what needed to be said and all while under extreme stress.
Wow amazing
Poor baby
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Same thing I thought
Great job sweetheart..praying your mom is ok..You are a wonderful young one..Thank you for your courage..
Did the mother live? So scary for that poor baby
That cop is a joke. He wouldn't take the boys word for it at all... He should be reprimanded at least. Not fired. But close.
Laughing at how slow the cops were to do anything. Like they helped eventually. But the kid had already said 'my mum had a seizure' and leads them to the car. I figure it's safe to assume she's actively drowning and needs immediate help.
He was so brave ❤❤❤
I like how he casually walks over and asks the obvious question then casually walks into the water while she is inhaling water.  Given the amount of time that was wasted I wonder if she survived at all.
That baby saved his mom life ❤
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I hope she’s o.k. ( It’s Bernard “Ma makaka ka dito” ) Thank you so much for good people like you. IfBernard Patrick is there…” Mommy is waiting be safe..and Tatay and Pa My Ma ❤ are 🙏🙏🙏🙏😂😂😂Amore, LORD TE GRACE… Mary Merriam Mariam,L/S Maria Teresa Jose,Mommy Tess
boy: shes having a seizure man: hello anyone there? duh? he just pointed out 🙄
Bless that child.
This mad me cry 😢  sweet boy
How you going to ask if there's somebody in there twice or somebody beating on the window and then you're going to walk hesitantly up to the car when a child is begging you to take you there cuz his mom's in the car having a seizure
Where’s the proud Superman music 😢
Prayers for them all ❤
If she is prone to seizures, why was she driving
This is why people who have seizures are not allowed to drive..thank God no one was killed
“Is somebody in there?!” Oh hey yea just knitting a sweater how ya doin?? GO GET HIS MOM WTF
Thank the good Lord what a Smart son
Gives me chills❤
❤OH LORD MY GOD! I THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACE AND MERCY! 🙏🏾 Thank the young man for his bravery and for the officer and gentlemen that were heroic and quick to give help!
Thank God that there are still kind and amazing humans in the world 🙏🏾❤️
Kind of stupid for him to ask if there's somebody in there.God forbid move your ass and save the person instead of wasting time with your mouth   What's wrong? You didn't believe the boy. The boy told you exactly what was happening.   God forbid wasting more time With the mouse, that's how the life works.Everybody's all mouth nowadays.Instead of running to somebody's rescue
Bless them❤
tbis cop is stupid and very slow
Why does it always take so much effort to make a cop do the right thing ... the boy had to scream to go save her when he was literally in front of the car, watching it drown
OMG the little boy face in panic is devastating. The mother still in the car, I hope she’s fine.
They cut out the part where the cop took like a whole minute cuz he didnt want to get wet
That poor kid. Thank God he found help.
Bro, I just saw mega Jerry. He probably helped us.
Can this officer be any slower and have more questions before he decides to go in the water and help!
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤❤❤❤
The Lord helps 🙏
Omg so thankful 😢
Preparanse pa los cocodrilos
My dad did that he picked up a hitchiker and then had a seizure and drove his car into a river, and the hitchiker didn't think to grab the wheel he was just there for the ride apparently
Brave little boy. Why the cop goes over to car with nothing to the brake glass, smh. Thank God for the Good Samaritan.
Why he was filming and taking his time
How does this even happen? "Save me whyt peepoo, I dun ba mizthake!"
My heart was with this child he was so afraid. Mom having a seizure. Much love to all
Stupid cop is so nonchalant when approaching vehicle smh
This kids got some good emotional regulation skills. Despite seeing his mom potentially lose her life he put that aside and got straight to the point for help.
What part of “she’s having a seizure” and “she’s in the water” made him have to question the kid again when they got there? Bro just go check.. precious seconds
Oh Heavenly Father,  please let her Survive.
英雄❤
"Is there somebody in there" Is this guy a donut or what ofc there fkin is!
Is somebody in there? I don’t get that question when he said “ She sunk, she’s having a seizure, help her!” Maybe it’s protocol? Glad those involved were at the right place at the right time. Truly a smart, brave and blessed child🙏🏾
Help mom sounded like she complained about her foot she was saved thank God for the men yhe brave son and everyone that helped at the hospital.
We need highway patrol and emergency vehicles and good Samaritan s this is a real world help mom you only get one.
I dunno video makes cop look incompetent imo.  But I’m just a regular citizen no true hero, so what do I know?
Massimo rispetto per queste persone
Thank God she is alright.  That look of horror on that little boys face broke me down.  Thank God for that cop and whoever else helped.
YH bless this man n boy. Saving his momma!
That family is meant for bigger things. Good to hear that the Mom is doing better.
God was with him to help get Mama help and survive😢😢😢
That cop took years to move into the water to help her out.....guess what would have happen the other way?....but thank Almighty GOD for that man already in the water trying to help her and for that lil boy for his bravery...god bless them both.
Thanks to the brave young man and for the police man because that would have been a fatality. Praise God
Thank you for saving this little boys mother 😮
Taco son bravo
Как-то всё на отебись делает не спеша, у нас бы побежаль да локтём ногами да в конце концов у меня ствол мог и им разбить а он как старая бабка движется
😭😭😭😭😭
Man, this was intense!  That poor boy.  He was so scared but still able to think on his feet and help his momma.  I hope they both are doing ok.  Well done,, young man....
The police officer slow asf omg
“is somebody in there?” wth kinda question is that
I know  about seizures, my son had Epilepsy his whole life. You are a brave son, thank good for the man who saved her too!!
I see something like a cat, not like a mom.
This is the kind of things cops do & many people arnt aware of. I Pray the Mom & Children DONT suffer PTSD and go on to live happy lives. GREAT JOB HEROS!
Poor little kid
Smart Boy ❤
Even though I knew this was already over it was so heart wrenching that I had to pray. I hope in the end she was okay.
Aw poor baby😭 he saved both of them
I know this scared the heck outta that kid😢❤ i hope they can get thru this
This mom is blessed to have a son like thos
Что это было ?
Deus existe 👆🏻🪐 gratidão gratidão gratidão universo AMÉN 🫂🙏
He actually stood there playing 20 Questions to the point the kid had to scream "HELP HER" at which point he continued to slow walk to the car taking his sweet time. Fuck is wrong with people.
Ohh that poor boy 😢
Huge respect for the two men who jumped in and got her out. Huge respect for the cop's CPR skills although he was slow off the starting line with ‘is somebody in there’.
God protect and bless our police!
Dumb ass cop asking if someone in there after the boy is pleading that his mother is in there…
I hope she never droves again this could have ended up way worse
Heroes❤
Wow I can't believe That woman was only a few more ," is she in there's?" from dying!   Smh
もっと急げばか
Damn it's so sad to see a black child look at some white cops as his only help most white cops would just laugh and keep it moving seeing a black child in distress
To hear the cop say ," is somebody in there" while SLOWLY walking towards the car was disconcerting. The boy had clearly told him that his mom was in the car. It felt like he was taking his time and not really concerned with quick action
Aww😢 poor kid...how awful.
Thank you Jesus
Thank God for this awesome child 🙏🏽❤
It pissed me off when the cop yelled “is there anyone in there” when the boy clearly told him his mom was in the. Car!
Omg!!!
I have epilepsy. Before we got it “under control” something like this was my biggest fear. I’m still nervous sometimes, don’t get me wrong. What a brave and mentally strong son this woman has! Great job, young man!
Thank you God ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
🙏🫶
It is stupid to wait for someone to reply from under the water in this case to move faster
stop asking questions and get her out every second counts really
God bless them🙏🙏❤️❤️
That baby is just traumatized!
The guy took his time !
And he gets his phone to video it.   Good lord what are we coming too?
Definitely a Good Samaritan… cause you don’t know what’s in those Texas swamp waters 😳
Lmao is she in there?? No this was just one big prank officer take us to jail now.
That poor baby. The trauma. Trying to keep it together and he's only a little boy. All involved are heroes!
Bless that babys heart. He wasn't going to stop until he got help for his mother. Glad God, always has a ram in the bush.🙏🙏🙏
Why didn’t they call for an ambulance?🚑
Thank God the boy went fir help and he found someone to help his mom.pray that she's ok I don't see how people that get that can be driving.thats really dangerous. N thank God there were no other cars around on the road.😮
Who gives a F!
Look like Liam off shameless
Can you move any slower?
😢😢😢😢
Thank you dear Lord Jesus Christ 🙏❤️
Cop took his sweat time
The desperation in the little boys face nearly killed me..I could feel his fear! What a great kid he is tho...saving his Mama, bringing help! WOW.!
Is somebody on there???
I'm so glad those men were there to save this precious lady. ❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Amen
😭😭😭🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
AMEN IN NAME AMEN
They'll start scolding me now, but children in Asia won't cry and scream at that age, they'll act to save their parents. And again, how can she drive a car with this disease??? Who gave her that right?
All these people are heroes!
Poor kid
Thanks you to all who helped. God Bless
A Texas lake as well respect
Why did the cop have to be told multiple times that a woman was in the car DROWNING before he listened? Idc if he didnt want to go in the water or not! Thats the job he signed up for when he got his little badge & gun & status of being above the law. I whole heartedly believe he would have let that woman die if another adult male wasnt already present.
stop ask the car if somebody is in there when the kid allrdy said to you whats up
Is someone in there nooo it’s just the wind
Poor baby 😢.  God bless him and the man who helped 🙏 ❤️ 💙.
Can the cop move a little slower perhaps..... Hollering is someone in there.  If she's having a seizure she can't talk.... Idiot & you can Clearly hear someone hollering from the car!!!!!
Why the hell do you post only the beginning of a story and never the whole thing? It drives mr crazy. What's the point?!
Amen 🙏🏽
😭
That boy is incredibly brave. I hope he does not suffer from flash backs after this and is able to live his young life to the fullest
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Why is he asking if someone’s in there if they would be under water
Oh that poor baby
😳🥺😢😭❤❤❤
Such great people
Why would she drive if she know she's prone to seizures.?
Am I the only one who tears came down?
"Is she in there?" "Is somebody in there?" "Is the car unlocked?" "Does she have her license and her registration?" He is picking every possible dialogue before doing the objective, and this is how you properly play an RPG
Why do people feel the need to record put the phone down so you have two hands!
Cop taking his sweet ass time
Thank You So Much and God Bless
Don’t people know go twords the part sticking in the air
Takes his time asking questions
Look at GOD ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you. God loves you. ❤❤❤❤
Bless his little heart he helped that officer get his mama out
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I am glad this boy saved his mother.
THAT IS SCARY!!! I HAVE GRANDMA SEIZURES AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY ARE COMING ON, I AM NO LONGER ABLE TO DRIVE BECAUSE I HAD A CAR WRECK THAT I ENDED UP IN A DITCH OF WATER AFTER FLIPPING THE CAR SEVERAL TIMES!! I AM NOW IN A FACILITY WHERE I HAVE TO HAVE HELP DOING EVERY DAY THINGS!!! AND THAT POOR BOY IS VERY BRAVE!!!
This child was so scared for his mom...also a smart child amen he's mom's ok.. He needs a plaque for his bravery ...
He should have arrested this black kid and sent him to jail wtf is wrong with law enforcement why are they not arresting him im so dissapoonted
В воде  наверное были аллигаторы
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Did she survive?
The cop asked if someone was in there…….. WHAT
Little boy saved his Mama for sure, & that cop, and the others that helped are all heroes! Thank you for being so brave and saving this woman’s life!!! When I was watching this I literally felt like I couldn’t breathe!!!!  Thank God 🩵
What a blessing.. I pray she is alright.. Lord take care of all that help to recused her
The cop was hesitant at first to go in the water... Prolly thought gators or something was in there... He goes to the car after the panicking boy tell him his mom in there hell her ..he goes is somebody in there smh
If they couldn't get into the car to get the mom, then how'd he get out?  Poor boy, he was so scared, but he did so good by fighting through the terror to go get help!
The kid says his mom is stuck in the car, and the woman is heard screaming from inside the car, but still he has to ask, "Is somebody in there?"

Took long enough.
Okay but why the fuck is the cop wasting all that time asking “is there someone in there” like yeah cause the drowned woman is going to become conscious again just to answer you
“Is somebody in there?” Bro wtf are you doing
May the Lord Bless those that rescued her.
💔💔💔 When he says "Help Her!".
Thank you to the cop,her son and whoever else was involved being so brave to save her
Dear Lord, keep your loving arms of protection around this mother and son.  Thank you for your grace and mercy.
Não deu para ver nada
Keep away your camera you can help her faster
This young man so desperate to save his mama broke my heart. Praise the Lord for the men that rescued her and the medical staff that helped her recover but most of all to God goes the Glory
Oh wow God is good
Thank goodness for all of you!! ❤

This is what America is all about instead of these government TV channels lying to us over and over again about America’s Heart! These people make me sick they talk for a living and make 7 figures for being  liars! That little boy hit a Grand Slam not just for his Momma but himself! Absolutely awesome y’all
❤❤❤❤ awesome child saving mom life
The child is frantically telling the imbecile that his mother is having a seizure and is drowning and that imbecile is STILL CALMLY STANDING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND CASUALLY ASKING “IS ANYBODY IN THERE”.  The utter lack of common sense and surrounding is truly astonishing
Damn... Thats scary.. brave kid 🙋‍♀️
U can feel the desperation in that lil lads voice bless him thank god for that boy hope all is well God bless 🙌
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cop moving a little too slow
“Is somebody in there?” 🙄 broooo she is drowning. She cannot respond
She's been in that water for 20 minutes. She was pronounced dead on the scene. She literally spazzed herself straight to hell.
When I was in the military I was at a Waterpark with friends when a toddler had a seizure and fell underwater. Fortunately he was pulled out but by the time I got to him he had already inhaled a large amount of water. My training kicked in and I was able to get him to expel a large amount of water and bring him inside. He continued to have seizures but he could breathe. I just placed him in a rescue position and calmed him aunt and uncle while we waited for EMS to arrive. Thankfully the boy was ok. Hopefully they were able to treat his seizures and he has continued to live a good life. He'd be about 18 now.
The audacity to say tell EMS to step it up when you’re pussy footing around the edge of the lake “anybody home”? style
God damn idiot cop “is someone in there” no the kids just running around crying looking for help for his mom for fun. Get in the water like you have a fire under your ass son, an embarrassment
la détresse n'a pas de couleur de peau soyons tous units🫡
Mom has a amazing child ❤ I hope both are living happy.
God bless the family
He aint no good cop.That little boy had to make him save his mother
Bro this cop is so slow 😭 "is she in there" NAWWW SHE'S AT HOME "is the car unlocked" PULL THE DAMN HANDLE
How many of us screamed at the recording? Of course she's in there! The child just told you that!
Very unsatisfying...couldn't see the victim...is she alive?
My my God
Yet this isn’t broadcasted on the national news because it doesn’t go along with the narrative that cops are evil and racism is all over. This is an awesome video of how people should help each other.
That is why we should never yell and disrespect the police
Little man is so brave and smart!
God Bless them there are angels among us 🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏 God bless them brave children also🙏🙏🙏
Thank God that car was still above water, thank God for the officer (info from another poster), and other 2 people who helped that day. That was scary😮!
It’s a v6 that’s why smh
They were all wonderful people, thank you for your kindness. Well done to that young man for his bravery, you all deserve medals. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thanks a lot to the two persons who saved the little boy's mama
Yo I saw this on the news a while back crazy
Thank goodness that Good Samaritan was there so the cop didn’t have to just stand there and watch someone die. Seems like US policing has changed a lot in the last 10-15 years. They used to be the ones jumping in and saving people.
People that have seizures should not drive just my opinion danger to themselves and others
❤❤❤❤❤ lots of love to all of them
Maybe dont drive into a pond
God bless this Mother, son and the people that helped them!!!
Deus, o menino (filho), o policial, funcionários da fábrica. Homens de boa vontade, não havia como dar errado. Final feliz!
This is how we need to live our lives together everyday. For the big things and the insignificant things. Stop thinking and just live together
Cop: is someone in the car? Kid: Of course there’s someone in the car!!! I’m a kid, standing here soaking wet and pointing to the car that I wasn’t driving!!!  🤯
The urgency these guys really with the haste to help this young boy🤔🙃
"Is it unlocked?" If not it's f'n fin to be.
"is somebody in there" no clearly rhe kid is freaking out over nothing
“Is there anybody in there?” What kind of question is that bruh he just told you there was like 3 times
So he’s a good samaritan for doing his job that’s crazy
BRAVE LITTLE MAN GOD BLESS YOU ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank God for good people, quick thinking that react to rescue families in emergency situations.  Thank you to all our rescue workers ❤️.
That baby soul was hurting, scared, and desperate😢
THANK YOU , JESUS...
Proud of our new jersey police and good Samaritans ❤
Oh that young boy HEARTBREAKENING his cries what a hero as well as the policeman ❤ Glad she made it❤
Watching that baby makes my heart ache thinking of how he must've felt watching his mom so close to dying😢
And the Dems want to defend the police and great officers like this!!!
Cop wasting time asking if she’s in there.
😢
Poor kid. God bless who saved her, including her child. Wow!
Ich würde noch langsamer machen.
How did the car end up in the small pound thought it’s not even close to the road ??
It's insane that nowadays a kid better handles a medical emergency after having escaped a sinking car in a lake, better than a young healthy adult... 😳
I understand from another commenter that she was saved and cop was honored with other rescuers. But from this limited clip, this cop didn't seem in a hurry about nothing. Didn't bring his window punch with him to an underwater rescue, had to go back for it. Seconds are important in this instance.  Reminds me i need to order one of those window punches
That cop slow
This young man just save his moms life. He’s a hero.❤
Hero's all around in this. Divine intervention was definitely at play here. God bless them all.
That baby knowing what a seizure is and then being able to clearly say it to get her properly helped is so huge. That is so traumatic to go through but he did everything he needed to do. I hope he knows just how much of a hero he is.
That poor baby is so scared and so distraught but so brave and did what needed to be done! I don’t know why, but it makes me wanna cry.
God bless them all!
That poor little guy😢
Tell ems to step it up 😂
Poor baby is terrified but did so great by getting help
He went through hell to get his momma saved
Bless all involved especially the good people who assist in her rescue.
I’ll never understand what step it up is supposed to mean. They drive at the maximum speed they’re allowed to and every emergency is an emergency. They don’t have an extra gear or some turbo boost available when it’s a particularly sad story.
Yrs it was the boy. Because the stupid cop instead of running faster. Was making questions.. If she in there? If somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? Shut up. And jump in the water😮😮
Fantastic job young man.... you saved your mother's life 👍
Did really had to film? I think it would be faster if he didn't document this moment! What's wrong with you people??
What the hell was she doing driving with a seizure disorder? These guys risked their lives to save her
Doesnt anyone find it strabge that the cop asks " anyone in there" after the boy already told the cop someone was in there! Seems strange to me.
This poor little sweetheart ♥️
Omg that poor boy 😭
Брось эту камеру и спасай людей придурок🤦‍♂️
This is why my friend had a special license to drive when she was 13 or 14. Her Mom had MS. She could only drive with and adult in the car. I wonder if those licenses are still issued.
YOU HAVE A RESCUE OUTFIT TO HELP IN AN EMERGENCY! SHE DIDN'T DIE FROM NEGLECT & HELPLESSNESS!
So many questions, these cops will do whatever they can to NOT help
Boy wasn't driving the car told him his mom was in there told him he's having a seizure he said is anyone in there bc I reeeeealy don't wanna get my pants wet it's my good underpants today
That's why women shouldn't drive
Gorzej gdyby tonął biały, negatywny bohater może iść na dno
The cop was so slow to act, he really seemed like he was pit out by the situation and he wished he could be home on the couch instead. Why the praise? Forst off the car was still above water somewhat so he didnt risk his life to dive down and save her, hes not just a civilian bystander, its quite literally his job to do this. But most of all he didnt even seem in a hurry until the very end.
Yes they do Amen
Epileptic patients shouldn't be allowed to drive or ride cars and bikess,for the safety and security of both patient and and everyone  !
I hope the mom is okay and I hope her son is okay and anyone else who was in the car. That is very traumatic. Thank you thank you thank you so much everyone for saving her life.
God bless everyone. That little boy is so calm. Give that sheriff a raise!
I've seen this video several times and I can help but feel upset that this officer was just taking his time
Why is the police officer acting like no one's in the car why is he hesitating don't ask the boy he already told you someone's in the car if someone's drowning  They're not going to be able to answer  you More training for apple's officers
Did she survive? She was in there for awhile
Hero ❤
😢😢😢💔💔💔 hopefully she's ok
Oh gosh that poor baby so frightened he was going to lose his Mom. I hope she's ok. 🙏🏼
Took him long enough… why tf is the cop just standing there saying “is somebody in there” Like what tf do you think???
Why tf are you driving when you have seizures and with a child in the car.
What an asshole ITS NOT LIKE HES SCREAMING AT YOU FOR 10MIN HIS MOM IS INSIDE THERE WTF
The cop yelling 'is somebody in there' while the kid screams 'my mom' and seconds matter, is infuriating...
“Defund the police” 🧢
😂😂😂😂
"is somebody in there" dude don't take your time to ask just do what is necessary bruh
❤
“Is somebody in there” naw thats just her parking spot
There was a minion toy💀💀💀
Cop didn’t do a single thing but pull the clearly stuck door handle and give orders. Hesitation man
Everyday Heros
That officer really taking his sweet time
A similar accident happened here in Mombasa Kenya. The young boy managed to swim through but His Mom didn't.
This man got on my nerves, the kid is TELLING YOU his mom is IN THE WATER, having a seizure. Then you get there and still ask if there's somebody in there? Is she in there? Like HELLO?! He just told you she is ffs!! 🙄
Shes SSSunk Bless that child i thought he said Drunk. Officer was so calm. Amazing duo
That son is everything ❤😢Great Job Baby ❤
May allah give this boy strength🤲
The thing for me is that mother probably didn't have medicine to prevent the seizures. I have dealt with seizures due to dealing with it with a family member and it's not easy to see. Well done to the son for being so brave
Bruh am i the only one wondering y buddy movin so damn slow. Like glad he saved her but some urgency would be coo big dogg
how long does someone have to be unconscious underwater for them to be un savable even with cpr
The dirty cop was reluctant to help. Why? Some little kid comes running up to  you, saying his, "Mom is having a seizure in the water" you better be running taking the initiative.
Why the fuck is he just walking all slow. Save the fucking women
Is the cop afraid of water or something? Hurry tf up, she's losing brain cells while you fuck around.
The trauma this amazing child experienced that day will linger for a very long time. I truly hope he gets the support he needs to heal from this.
GOD is always there 🙏
I’m sorry but when I first started watching this all I was thinking was where is the officers sense of urgency.
How did the boy get out?
Policia rescata ?  Pero lo obvio es que el ciudadano intervino y acciono como debía ser.
That felt like a slow-motion rescue. Im smazed she survived. Poor woman and son, what an ordeal!
Kid: she’s having a seizure  Cop: “is somebody in there” ???????????🤔🤔🤔 Me: ME BRO WTF THE CAR IS 90% submerged
I hope everyone got out ok. 😢
As the mother of an Epileptic this is my worst fear
Did she survive?
LORD IM TERRIFIED OF DEEP WATERS. 😬
Bless that young man. He was so frightened. I'm hoping she ended up OK!!
Господи какой ужас...
waiting for someone to yell “yes i’m here” was stupid af literally brain dead
The absolute lack of urgency from the officer. He's no hero.
Everybody was BLESSED that DAY!!!!😮❤
🙏🙏🙏
To protect and serve...
Is someone in there what the hell smh
I thought with epilepsy. You couldn't drive it's dangerous. To drive with that. They told you she is already. Glad she was saved. Despite wow is she in there.
Poor little boy.  Very traumatic. Thank God her son saved her life.
Poor baby he was so frightened😢
Thank God shes lived to care for that beautiful hero of a boy shes got there ❤❤
she’s alive???
Felt so terrified!  Thankful this mother was saved.  Hugs for her son!  I know it was traumatic for him!  Sending him a big warm hug!  Prayer!
Bless You
That cop could’ve had a little more pep to his step. Is the car unlocked? Idk bro go try it????
Many prayers for this family
Did she survive? This shares no news. This is an example why I think people with epilepsy shouldn't drive. I think they should get free rides via state care.
"my mom is having a seizure in the car shes in the water"  "Is anyone in the car?"  Stupid
Thank God that her son was there ‼️🙌🏾🙌🏿🙌🏽
The Cop asking is somebody in there sounds funny......dude go check.....
Did she live
Why the cop so slow at the start even tho the kid went to the water
He said in somebody in there the boy said it like 5 times  like duhh
If you have a medical condition like this, you shouldn't be driving. More of a danger to the community then anything with a license. If this is spontaneous than that's another story.
But why is this boy in the water 💦 like that ? And “is the car unlocked “ huh 🤔?
Ah Jesus thank you. God bless this cop and the two other men. Lil men you’re a savior🙏🏾❤🫶🏾
This is truly the work of God. The little boy is obviously raised right. God bless the family and the Police heroes who rescued his mama❤🎉
Imagine trying to find help for your drowning mother and the first thing the guy does is pull a phone out to record and then does everything half assed and one handed because of it. Thank god shes ok but istg STOP RECORDING PEOPLE IN DISTRESS AND ACTUALLY HELP!
The cop was too relaxed. Wasn't he?
....how many times did he need to affirm that his mom was in the car? Why did the cop keep asking the same question?
Absolutely amazing
She was drunk?
Kid clearly explained what’s going on and guy replies “someone in there?” Like tf’ did you not just hear him? Goes back to get a center punch should have had it with him in the first place and just like hobbeling along didn’t seem to have much hustle glad it turned out alright but this guy I feel like he had a “don’t wanna be doing this job” kinda attitude the entire time from this video maybe even racist
This boy is the reason miracles literal
😢😮omg is she ok
❤
Wow 😮!
❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
People with seizure disorders should NOT DRIVE!!! That poor child...
That poor kiddo.  ❤ So glad he got help.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤😊😊
That cop has issues
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
This young man did such an awesome job, his mental focus under stress is impeccable!!
Thank you 🙏🏿 sir.!!
Asking if someone is in a car that's submerged in water is just baffling like dude really
🙏🏽🙌🏽
Why yall hating on the cop get a grip my god think every cops a racist and useless look in the mirror most of you that feel that way are
Thankful for her son and all the wonderful brave men that saved her life 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿❤️❤️❤️
God bless them all, and in the name of Jesus, I ask God to heal his mom from the seizures.
That little boy could be my son’s twin I literally had to look twice. Gave me chills. Such a hero ❤️
God is good🙏🏿
Surely if she has seizures she's not safe to drive. Thank god her child got her some help.
Petrifying.x
“is somebody in there” lmfao….. yeah no kid is pranking
good samaritan? he's on duty. thats his job.
That childs anguish breaks my heart! God bless these heroes!
I love this videos, young man saved his momma ❤😢😮
I’m crying. 😢Poor baby boy. He is a hero and everyone else that helped save his mommas life.
Omg , thank  you God for them courageous men ❤
Praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Father God, in Jesus name
"Good Samaritan cop" er... yeah, but... isn't that sort of the cop's job in a situation like that?
Cops spend so much time being  bad cops  they don't know how to be a good cop why wasn't his first Response  to jump into the water instead of asking if someone was in there that's why the little boy ran to you that's why you put him in the back of your car to drive to the location where This Woman's car was sunk. Better yet asking if the car was unlocked. Why does it matter you can't open the doors. I would really love to see the minutes and the second ticking by on this video to see how long it actually took him to decide to get in that vehicle and save that woman.
Praise God! In a very bad situation, all things worked together to save her life👏 🙌 🙏
My heart dropes for this sweet boy. GOD BLESS OUR POLICE FORCE!
I’m Glad he was there to help save her 🫶🏽🫶🏽
This cop wasted a lot of time.
Thank you, Jesus!!!
Wow! What amazing courage young man. God Bless you and the Officer. Great human beings. God bless all of you.
Smart young man!
Not only did they save this mother, they avoided a gator. In Texas, that’s not just good luck that’s god.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾💯💯💯💯
Amazing young man
Bro the kid did great, but if we’re being honest the cops were being pretty damn slow going down to that car, he’s wading through the water as if he’s gonna go fishing, and the boy already told him his mom was in the car but the cop starts unnecessarily asking “Is she in there” like no shit Sherlock that’s why the kid is begging you to come rescue her.
Las lagrimas se me dalieron al ver al niño Gracias a Dios hay gente Buena❤
Thank you Jesus our father our Lord our savior even this young boy the strength to find help and to leave them the way our prayers are with his mother and his young boy and all the rescuers Amen Que Lindo Bella Bella Bravo Bravo 👏👏👏
Una velocidad de reacción tenía el cabron
🤲🏾
😢😢😢 🙏 🙏 🙏
Good save.
Omg poor things hopefully there mom lived🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Cop taking his sweet time with it too
Aww the boy's face of panic, just wanted to hug him. Thank God those 2 men were his angels that day. ❤
Why is he moving so damn slow??
Nobody but GOD
Boy : She's sunk. Shes in the water. Help Her  Cop : Is Anyone In There??? 🙃
thank you jesus
Tell EMS, step it up!!! Those are the words of someone who is desperate to try and save another human life. This young boy and the others who saved her live are heroes. God bless and protect you all.
Bless him.. he is strong
Smart boy. He thought and responded quickly.❤
The boy did a very good job giving valuable info, being concise and clear
Главное не забыть всё снять...
Cop only took 10 business days
Thankk GOD for the son, cop ans everyone who assisted in saving her life!!!!
That little boy was horribly upset but he had his wits about him and told all the grownups what had happened.  He saved his mom.
God is good
The copy was carrying a child  I think.
I think that cop should’ve moved a hell of a lot faster, and stopped asking stupid obvious questions. Why do dispatchers and cops ALWAYS do that? It’s infuriating. 🤬
When someone has epilepsy they arent allowed to drive.
💯🤣🫠❤️‍🔥👌👉🎉
You know it’s these types of videos and acts that need to be promoted. There are forces and groups that spout propaganda to have some black people think that white people as a whole are racist. Look at the love and concern here. Let’s not be deceived. It’s all about character and the heart of a person not about sweeping generalisations. We need to a stop being swayed by deception and allow it to divide us as humans.
Love how the COP very slowly and casually walks up, and instead of diving into the water to save people he'd rather have a full on conversation.. Glad he's being paid hourly by the people hes "saving"
Amen 🙏 for angel's!!
God bless them all
God is so good Amen 🕊️💯❤️🕊️🙏💯❤️
Uhhhhh
Obrigada Deus pelas vidas salvas e pelo heróis humanos
Good save!
That poor sweet baby was incredibly brave and courageous he kept it together enough to not only escape his self but to go get help for his momma. 😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤
Parabéns para está corajosa criança, Deus abençoe e proteja sempre está família 🙏
Ughhhh im a crybaby.. Thanks to her baby boy he so brave and the officer quick action🙏🏾
Angels watching over & angels in human form. God bless that child for being so brave & smart.  Thank God that Police officer was near by. 🙏🙏🙏
Thanks to her so for getting her help we need more kids like him in the world ❤❤
Notice how the cop didnt do shit, and a citizen was who rushed to help her.  Good will isnt done by the state. Cops shouldn't exist
That poor baby! I'm happy she was rescued!
That was stupid. Of  her first off She knew she had Seizures. Why would she be drivit's her fault?She knew better
Great police man...someone who will always be trusted. He never hesitated  or waited for someone else  to go under the water. Fortunate family to meet the right man.
This is why you don't drive when you have seizures. It could have been fatal. In this case it traumatized her son and everyone around her. Her son saved her life. This little boy will never forget his mom, almost dying. This day he was a hero. For the rest of his life he'll worry about his mom. Thank you to all who saved this little boy's momma. What a scary situation for all, even for us who are seeing it happening! 😮 I'm so glad it ended on a good note.
God is good
Poor boy. Glad he kept it together to get help
Oh my gosh, that poor little boy. I hope they rescued her. I hope it was OK.
God bless this police officer heart always! Good job sir ! We need more officers like you in this world!
When he said"Tell EMS 2 step it up" he know it was a all bad. He wasn't going to let that Little boy down that day. THANK YOU 2 ALL of the good Samaritan's
Thanks to her son and the other rescues for helping his mother 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾Thank God she’s okay🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
❤ 🙏❤
Dudeomfg... thank god that kid acted fast snd found help! I hope shes okay
Man. As someone who has epilepsy, a kid, a son, ANYONE who can help us when we're totally out of it are  a blessing... It's the most scary shit ever
Seems like the COP has time to record it and the boy was trying to rush him before mom ran out of time
The kid & the 2 factory workers did all the work to save the woman. Cop didn't even get in the water right away. Asked a seizing woman who is in a car under water if anyone is there. HOW is that gathering important info & not wasting important time? If those 2 workers weren't there this lady likely would've died. They busted the window out. They got her out of there. All the cop did was perform cpr cause cops are only willing to help if it doesn't endanger or seriously inconvenience themselves.   And no I'm not a felon. Never been arrested or even got detention back in hs. I'm a southern white woman. I'm just not asleep like you sheep praising unworthy cops. No, not all cops are spineless bullies but unfortunately MOST are. Police culture is rotten & needs to change. If you aren't willing to risk yourself even a little for the sake of others, you shouldn't be a cop.  Like that hoard of heavily armored cops who stood around high fiving each other & doing nothing while a shooter was killing elementary school kids. You're blind if you don't think we have a problem with our police.
That ladies guardian angel grew inside of her womb. God blessed her with this amazing young man!!!
Why is she driving,is my question with her medical condition? Someone isn't telling the truth about there medical condition to DMV, or she is driving with a driving license.
"No Michael it means bear right"
Anyone else notice the cop did the absolute minimum effort shit? Didn't even get in the water right away. Wasted time asking the seizing woman under water if anyone was there. Wasn't until the two factor workers came and busted the window open that anything got done, but of course most of that was edited out to make the cop look like the hero.  He did perform cpr but basically cops were only willing to help when it doesn't inconvenience or indanger themselves.
I pray this family is doing well now.
Thank you, Jesus, for saving her!!!! ❤❤❤❤
He looks like the black son on shameless 😮
Cop took his sweet azz time!
Proud of the young boy
Oh my, that poor wonderful boy, desperately saving his Mom. May God give them many many years together.🌿
Thank you lord !
Whoever you are, you are a good person. God bless you ❤
They are heroes
That cop has no reaction... "Is somebody in there? It's the car unlocked?" after the kid is clearly frantic. It's the kids mother like he already told you. Hurry up, call it in, and save the woman.
😢😢😢 merveilleux petit garçon 👏👏👏 tu es plus qu'une pépite pour ta maman 💜💛💙💚❤💖 Par ton comportement tellement Mature, nous savons que toujours tu seras à ses côtés, merci aus personnes étants venues porter secours soyez tous bénis 🙏🤲. Merci you tube et caméramans pour ces images humaines. Finalement, je veux croire que Sur cette planète 🌍🌏🌎, il y a encore beaucoup 🤝🤝🤝 De belles et bonnes personnes 🙂.
God bless them all❤❤❤ thank God and you Sir🙏🏽🙏🏽🙌🏽❤️
😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏
Oh the fear in that baby’s eyes.  What a hero ❤
Две вещи удивили. Камеру из рук не выпустил даже под водой. И очень спокойные голоса у мужчин и действия медленные, неспешные.
That young lads cries for help God bless all those who helped rescue his mumma ♥️🙏🏻♥️
Nah that’s gator water this officer has balls of steal ❤
🙏❤️🙏
I don’t know these people but this little boy reduced me to tears and these guys are forever my hero!!!  Thanks so much for your BRAVERY ❤❤❤
Thankyou man❤❤❤❤
Prayers. For. Her
When you need the police they are ok and save lives and not quite the assholes some people make them out to be
🙏🙏🙏
Man, you can hear the terror in that kid's voice ... his Momma's life is in mortal danger (!!)  ...  He does such an amazing job holding it together, though, and getting her the help she so desperately needed. Her son is a true fighter and hero in his own right. 😏
❤
Oh her poor son.  He's the true hero for running and getting help.❤
Pprque se demora tantoooooo
Amazing citizens! Thank you❤
God be with.him an his mother ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cop took his time
Whoever you may be that saved her life, I thank you for helping❤❤❤❤❤ shall God Ceaser you and your family the rest of your way 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
That baby boy is a hero!!!!❤❤❤❤ Thank God they are both ok
Good save guys
Господи помилуй 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
They said cop. When it should say.  God first her son the man in the water already then the cop saved this Mom. Give recognition where it's due. ❤🙏
Bro cops are like burocrats now he's just standing there after that kid said all that and was trying to open it he's just like is she in there... I bet his testosterone us low and he's on his way to dibeaties
OMG. ❤ Thank God everyone ok & the son a hero. Helping his mom.  😢I'm still crying caz if she have seizures she definitely. Does not need to drive a car or drive after this. It's to dangerous & puts every1 @ risk. For things like this.   🙏 Prayers goes out to all
The boy said she was asshole
God bless
Hallelujah ❤❤❤
Thank you all for the update.  I'm just seeing this now and the tears are streaming. God was blessing this family 🙏🏾
That poor baby looked so helpless 😢 what a brave soul u saved your mom love 😊❤
He saved his mom❤❤❤💯💯💯
Oh my goodness that little boy was so smart to get help !!! That was a great day!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is somebody in there? 🤦🤦
He literally told you she is in the water! Smmfh
The cation should read  "human saves another human....
😮😮😮😮😮😮
"tell ems to step it up" ... Damn ...
WOW.
“Tell EMS step it up” 😂😂
That woman should never should have been driving knowing she might have had a seizure. She is lucky she didn't kill herself and her son and a car full of other people.
I have seizures so I know how my son feels when I'm driving bless his heart ❤️❤️❤️ I feel so sorry for I don't drive anymore😢😢😢 my son is grown and married now with four children I'm so blessed can my husband is so sweet😊😊
God bless you all,truly blessed.
Such a brave boy! All of them are Heroes!
Has seizures but still driving anyway
❤❤❤
Her car went in the water where there was help all around her. Bless all the people that help save her. ❤🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🇨🇦
That young man jumped into action when the cop stood by yelling asking if someone is in the car. Thank God the cop jumped in to help that lil boy.
That cop should have more urgency! I mean fuck.
Heroes all.
Angels walk among us. ❤
I'd venture to guess that if mom has a seizure disorder, shes NOT medically authorized to drive for this very reason. Glad everything worked out in the end.
The child is so brave  bless his heart lord be with them❤
Omg that young boy having to go thru that is so sad and you can hear the pleading in his voice for the cop to hurry and save his mom ❤. I hope that she is ok and doing better.
This is why people with seizures get their license taken away. Too dangerous for everyone.
Им буксировочные тросы разве не выдают
Главное держать снимать видео, человек калека всего 1 рабочая рука
That kid would get everything in the world if I was his mum. He is an awesome little guy and well done to the people for rescuing her.
He smart to know to go get help instead of staying there panicking
Thank God for that man being right there to help that child and his mom❤
После криков мальчика: "Спасите мою маму, она ТАМ!", полицейский задал слишком много вопросов безмолвно тонущему автомобилю. 🧐  Приятно удивлена, что при такой "расторопности" удалось спасти маму этого ребенкаа. 🙏❤
The son, the rescuers well done.
Они же на машине. Почему не вытащили своей машиной эту затонувшую. Было бы быстрее
White people are awesome ! We are the glue holding this world together. We make this world go round.
Thank God for that child
What an idiot driver how tf that happen
Not panicked and asked for the help 🙏💪
Omg hurry save her clearly he said his mom under water
2 WORDS  AWESOME AND AMAZING BABYYYYY, YOU GUYS DID THAT GOD BLESS YOU FOREVER HOWEVER LONG EVER IS.  GOD WILL ALWAYS KEEP YOU  !
They are not good samaritans, they are just doing their job to serve and protect
This remands me the "are you chocking???"
🙏
I see a lot of negative comments about the officer who did CPR and saved her because he asked the boy is she in there. If you listened to the little boy, he said his mom was in the water, that is why the officer asked is she in the car. She could have gotten out with the boy and be in the water and not the car. He had to make sure where to look. Open your ears people.
Imagine trying to save someone and your first thought is, I must record this
Thank God there was a cop , what would we be with out cops,  they give their lives to save and protect ❤
Thank God, they were able to save her
What a wonderful young man, saving his mama!
What do they mean is someone in there he told him his mom was having a seizure and is drowning
Thank you fir helping, he spoke up for his MOM, , the man kept asking is she in there.Great Job than k s f I r not giving up!!!
❤ God bless all who were involved in saving this Mother!
Anyone wanting to know 2 factory workers carried mum out she survived was weak and needed to recover for a while but is ok all 3 men were awarded medals for their bravery the cop and 2 factory workers i also think the little boy should of got one as he alerted them and acted quick enough so mum had a fighting chance of being saved a few more seconds and she wouldnt of made it that's how close it was.. this little boy is also a hero ❤
What a brave boy! God bless him 🙏 ❤
Why did it take the cop so long to get in the water?
Wow what a brave boy. He saved his mother’s life. I pray she recovers fully and he recovers mentally from such a trauma at young age. Lord knows their lives are probably difficult enough in this cruel world.
I was for a second like why they showing the footage of the lady who killed her kids but it wasn't that footage
🙏🏾
Tf is he asking questions for the kid just told em what happened.
What a dumb ass are you expecting someone underwater to respond??? Why you filming more than helping???? Why are you standing still while shouting that shit too
Oh my gush! She was so lucky
do all policemen ask stupid questions?
Reminds me of when Ted Kennedy was in a car with a woman that flipped over into a pond .he got out but he didn't  get any help to get the woman.. out he didn't report it till 12 hours later..!
This is heart breaking. I feel for that kid. What a scary experience for him. Hope his mom is alright.
They Jerked  the camera around so much ,.you couldn't see anything...
😱😨😰oooooo
Did she survive?  Poor boy 😢. God Bless him for helping save his Mom ❤ & the one who responded & helped♥️
酒鬼開車的下場😂
Thank God Amen, God was there to help his mother, through those men, it was a blessing through God,he had those men their to saved her life Amen 🙏❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Poor baby. I hope she recovered
I hope that his mama is ok....
This really happened
That poor child. 😢
This is so obviously staged! In real life cops dont help black people
😂
God bless this young king and his mother. ❤ And thanks to those who raced into action to save this woman.
That cop is too slow and asking too many questions.. emergency services my ass.
Why is the cop asking questions get tf in the water
Cop kind of annoyed me with the “is somebody in there”
Gracias a Dios por permitirnos ser parte de un milagro!
Thank God for the quick thinking young man and the good samaritan
That cop "really acted fast". 😤😤😤🤬🤬🤬🧐🧐🧐🤯🤯🤯
Call baby he is so worried about his mama. I hope she was ok.
How did she even get a driving license?, lm glad she found help but this could have ended badly if she was to be on the freeway or something
😢😢😢😢
I did not hear about this.I live five minutes away😮
JESUS
Filming or rescuing??
That friggen COP MAN!! The boy is SOAKED and he’s asking is she in there  -he says she was!-and is it unlocked ? Like RESCUE IS MOM DUDE
Thank GOD that this ladies son was able to get help for his mom.❤❤❤❤❤
Who filming it?
Bro took his sweet time talking bout “is someone in there 🥱”
Thank God!  No more driving, mama!😮
❤God Bless him for going after help for his Mother.Hes the true hero.Thanks to all the workers also involved in saving this young man's Mother.Sure hope it all turned out great.Amen.❤
Omg why don’t ppl crawl onto the roof? How fuggin dumbbbbbbb
Pray she is OK.
Damn he took so long to help. Stupid racist
Look, I get it. High stress situation and he wants to confirm… but wtf did he think would happen if he asked 😭 like kid said she had a seizure and was IN THE WATER LMAO
I am glad she is ok Amen 🙏🏾
the guy losing his breath ,my mom is there ,,and the police ,hellooo is somebody there ?..in this situation 2 seconds  determines brain death or a complete recovery.
Precious son crying to save his beautiful mom. Dear God in Heaven I hope mom’s survived this trauma. So proud of her baby boy.
Is somebody in there? He said she's in the water having a seizure, he's soaking wet and is inthe water trying to get in the car. Is that cop awake
That boy was so stressed out. Bless him.
She gonna say she had a seizure..... She was straight racing that charger.  Hopefully the cop saw right threw the bullshit.
Thank God! Brave officer! Brave son!
Muchas gracias por salvar la vida de esa persona!!!!!! Dios le recompensara
Glory to God 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
“ is she in there? Is there somebody in there? Is the car unblocked?” no… didn’t you see her in the corner of the video sipping on the margarita sitting on a floaty. Ppl ask some dumb questions in serious situations like this one
OMG!!! I Had a Seizure with my teenage Daughter in The Car in 2008!!!
The cop didn't want to get he's shoes wet until the kid tries to break the window what a coward
God bless you sweety u are mommy s hero for get help to save her life
Is the car ok
In case you Ever find yourself in this situation, the Back window is your best bet. Since it's sticking out, it doesn't have the water pressure on it that you won't be able to overcome, and it's really easy to shatter.
Thank you Officer for helping them.  Blessings
Oh damn, poor boy. This must have been so traumatic for him, I wonder if this was something that only happened once
Ty Jesus ❤️
I hope she is alright! Poor boy so scared. Bless them all! Thank you to the police that rescued her.
My heart goes out to little man
I hope mom survived and the kid is doing ok!
Wow. Little boy is absolutely a hero as are the people that believed him and took action. Hope the mum made a full recovery.
Terrifying for that child!  Hope Mom is okay!!❤
I’m glad she’s ok. His son was awesome to get some help. Thank God for those who helped her. You all are heroes!
Dios los bendiga
Thank you so very much for saving your mommy , lil man ..huge hero Thank you so very much for helping to get his mommy out of the water and the help she needs... I can't stop crying...  God bless each of you and your families and keep each of you and your families completely PROTECTED and SAFE ALWAYS AMEN AND AMEN!!!!
Such a brave little boy!!! 😢❤❤
Cop way too slow and seems uninterested !
Maybe I missed it but does anyone have the GoFundMe link to this?  Any news updates on Mom’s condition?
i wish the cop had a bit more urgency.
😢😢😢smh  God bless the rescues
Good son!
Well done lad, you saved her life by finding this cop. His cries are breaking to hear.
It is so heart warming to know there are people out there (perfect strangers) who will react without hesitation to save someone's life.  ❤ Not everyone would have done this.  They may call 911 or let the next person coming along will try and help.  We can't keep passing the buck.  If we are capable of helping we should.
Thank you for saving her ❤❤
Thk u 4 helping
I have seizures 😢 God is AMAZING 🤩 ❤
This is what you get in high trust societies, non of that socialist bystander effect gringe.
😢
SOOOOOO  GOOD HEARTED AND SOOOOOO THOUGHTFUL AND SOOOOOO  BRAVE, AMEN
A kid witnessing smt traumatic is dramatic
Poor boy.
Good job buddy!!
She probably was riding on a donut
God love you 😍 ❤️ ♥️ 8❤❤
Trauma!
EPILEPTICS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DRIVE!!!! POOR KID.
Oh my god 😢he and the gentlemen’s saved her life
White men being top of the food chain..good job you're man card is renewed for life..🎉❤
Cop was taking  his sweet time and didn’t ask is the car locked? WOW.
Misericórdia  dios🙏
🙏🏾
Defund the police?! 🚔  defend the blue! 💙 thank God for heroes.
He was so slow to help 😢
Poor boy trauma hope he is ok
He’s a hero
Thank You LORD 🙏
Omg for them to ho through that  touched my heart . Brave son God bless them both I pray she's OK ❤🙏🏾
W kid
Omg that is scary
Poor kid will never forget this day. I hope he and his mom live long and prosper.
Poor kid🙏🇺🇸❤️
Such a brave little boy to save his and her life
God bless this little boy. He got straight to the point with no hysterics. Thank you to the Officer, bystander & EMS. Hopefully this boy learned people are generally good, cops & all. Hope mom is ok. ❤
Cop: "Is somebody in there?" *The Woman busy drowning and dying*  Cop: "Welp nobody answered so I can go home now. She should had answered 'I am here. Drowning' If she wanted help >:( "
Bless this sweet child, he was so brave yet so frightened. Thanks to our earthly angels & him, his Mom’s life was saved.  ❤️
❤thank you
That’s why you don’t drive if you have seizures. What is worse when you hurt someone else.
O look white cops helping a black family why isn't This go's viral... I realy hope she is OK  por kid ...
Praise God For all He Has Done 🙌🏾🙌🏾
Thank God for this man to be around when needed ❤ Respect 🙏
In my experience, cops take MINIMUM effort to save people.  When I had a cardiac arrest at home 13 years ago, my wife gave me solo CPR for 10m, a cop arrived, and instead of helping he stood and WATCHED her working on me until 4 min later when paramedics arrived and took over. It was all caught on a nanny-cam.
PRAISE THE LORD ❤
funny how black people want cops in an emergency
O policial parecia bem lento para começar a agir. Afogamento exige reação rápida, você tem segundos ou poucos minutos para salvar a vida da pessoa. O policial ainda ficou um tempo parado na frente do carro perguntando pro nada se tinha alguém dentro do carro. Se fosse filho dele se afogando, o policial agiria da mesma forma, na mesma velocidade? Certamente que não.
My heart sank when i saw the boy crying so desperately. Huge thanks to a hero cop for saving the woman...
“Is somebody in there?” Seriously, how much stupid are you? And he takes a video.
Oh my God😥
🙏
She should not be driving she endangered her child. I know people that insist on doing this, drive  because their entitled behavior is,” I’m not disabled!”
the officers nonchalantness is driving me crazy
😢🙏🏾❤️ TO GOD BE THE GLORY ,THAT YOUNG BOY ❤His MOM
Thank you, Jesus❤❤❤
Poor baby had to repeat himself so much in desperation. He is an extraordinary kid, his Mom should be so proud.
The fear and despair of losing his mother is so powerful what brave strong boy so glad the man listened and was able to save his mother from drowning
Amen God is good all the time 🙏
God bless you police officer  Vote trump to fund police more
Should people who have seizures be able to drive?  Why is their driving privilege more important than public safety..? Too many terrible accidents caused by seizures... its preventable
It was really smart for the child to run and get help. This is an excellent where  we must recognize  and acknowledge and appreciate an example of where the police officer was a level-headed and compassionate person who assessed how to resolve the situation   and clearly helped in saving the child's mom's life.
Because shes black he didnt act premeditated
So this guy s one of those videos that they don’t know you in the national news, but the ones of a cop issuing a ticket to a minority does.
Misericórdia senhor 🙏🙏
Praise GOD  for the help and bravery of  her son.
Praise God!!!!!
Is she still alive?
That poor boy... i pray  that they saved his mama
🙏🌹
God is so good!🙏🏾♥️🙏🏾
Starman
Hope the woman is alive with her son , it is sad to see the anguish face of the boy
Howd he get out though??
Praise Jesus
God bless the boy who was calm enough and had the wherewithal to get help. God bless those who stopped to help. God bless the mama who raised such a fine young man.
Спасибо добрым людям за помощь!!
I hate seeing kids cry or anybody really 😢i 🙏🏾 she alright
Thank you officer and son of course. Please understand the police officer could have been in shock doing his best also to slow down and stay calm. Please be understanding before you are quick to criticize. Just in general.
The cop did not wanna get wet lol.
Good Samaritan cop?  Thats his job ffs 😂
This really touched my heart, her son showed bravery and love for his momma
Thank YOU LORd. For saving them.
If the windows are up, how did the boy get out?
YES THERE'S SOMEBODY IN THERE!!! FFS!
Why did he ask if anyone was in there? 🤷🏽‍♀️
Poor baby! What a terrifying thing to happen.
What a strong little boy.
Wow hurry up police officer just walking around asking questions she is dying FFS
That is 😭 😢😮
Same thing happened to me and my 18 month old but the lake was 150 feet below the road and we landed upside down knocking me unconscious. Only reason we lived is because there were people fishing.
The fact that the cop took his time being in the water asking if someone us in there blows my mind, after the lil boy clearly said she was in there!!
Amen to the little boy and the guy God is so good ❤❤😢
The horror in that little boys face is hard to take...
Little Man got out and went for help❤❤❤❤Hope moms ok....do you have more story....
Prayers for all 🙏🏻🙏🏻 I hope she is okay
😂wait. Come back whenever you feel like it. Wow ok.then. Thank you God.  I am grateful for your guidance and protection ❤🙏 Amen
Oh señor gracias 🙏🏻 por permitirlo
So ❤ breaking ....hope she is ok
Came so close to breaking down.  THIS us what we need to see more of.....people acting like caring human beings.  The way God intended.   Bless her son and this Officer.  They are the BEST!!!
Thank god for heroes like these men!!!
# u go Orange 🧡🍊 county # brave #. Cop ❤❤❤
That’s so good that the police saved the mom but I feel bad the police is soaking wet
GOD BLESS our first responders. Prayers for this Mom & son.
Amazing baby bless you prayers to your mom🙏🎉
Poor baby
Goddess, this brought tears to my eyes. What brave sweet boy
He literally said, “she’s having a seizure, she’s sunk, she’s in the water...” & he still asks “is somebody in there”😬 🤷🏻‍♀️…he must have been so panicked that he wasn’t paying attention to what the crying/ distraught boy was saying, he was pretty clear but again, nerves will do that.
That precious little boy will always have the proof of his bravery and quick thinking and knowing his mother is alive because of it. God bless all these unsung everyday heroes walking among us.
❤❤❤
I hope Mom was okay I've got goose pimples
"is somebody in there?" What an idiot
Praise God 👏
I’m guessing since the young child was able to verbalize that his mom was having a seizure, it means she’s had them before. If so, why was she even driving a car?
God bless that little angel of a boy. See how concerned he was. May GOD BLESS everybody who helped save the woman in the car.🙏🏻
He clearly said his mom is having a seizure.
Thank you God!
Wow great rescue
I did not Know axon body cams are water proof 🤯🤯🤯
Was she ok?
I hope he grows up to be great man & with his help and other’s his mom will be there to see that.
The poor child will remember these moments for the rest of his life. How traumatic!
And this is why people with seizure disorders can’t have licenses. Even if you’re doing everything you’re supposed to you still can have one while driving. I hope she gets a diagnosis and treatment soon.
Oh my goodness so much happened that was right for this poor woman. Her baby was so courageous. Thamk goodness his courage was rewarded by a police officer being where he was needed.
А нельзя было спасти жизнь человека без камеры?
О, как малыш кричал, плакал. Как боялся  за свою мамочку.
Thanks to the young man for knowing how to save his mom, his clearness was remarkable in the mindset he was in and also to the men that saved her💙💙🙏🏽🙏🏽
God bless you young man and officers, I pray she's alive, Dear Lord.
درود بر انسانیت و مهربانی و عشق ❤❤❤❤و همچنین بر شما نازنینان ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The amazing lad may Elohim bless him
Absolutely  Greatest  Hero ❤
America allows sick people to have driving license 🤔
Cops are strange , they can save a person and in the same time killing another easily, this is USA
This is why people who have a history of seizures should NOT be driving! Thank God her son was able to get out and get help! 🙌 ✝️🙏
The child already said she was having a seizure, who do he think would answer? His first response should have been back up then into the water you go. Time is critical. The first class in the Academy should be common sense.
Most headrests have a window punch at the bottom for future reference folks
What an amazing little boy so much courage ❤
Is this a police camera?
fucking hell could of moved abit faster 😅
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Beautiful timing and made the right decision. Some would’ve struggled what to do ❤ I’m glad this one was blessed
That is so traumatic for that child. I hope his mom survived this. Her son is so brave and thank goodness for that cop
🙏🏼
Amazing boy, saved his family by finding help! I have seizures, went black out into a swamp 2 wheels up. My Service Dog was with me & rescued me. This reminded me of how many Heroes it takes to save lives.  🙌🙏 Rescue folks who braved water to save lives.
🥇🥇🥇🥇💛
Bless this man, Lord!!
Sorry but you can't park there mate.
How many times does a poor kid have to say my mom is in the car before the cop takes him at his word. Holy F!
As a person who suffers with epilepsy thank God he was able to get help we loss so many to drowning
HERO❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
All praises to the Most High for putting people right where they need to be when they had no idea they'll be there🙏🏾
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Lord Jesus 😮
😮 wow
Thank you for Saving her life ❤😊 God bless you ❤
“Is the car unlocked?”
Thank God for that brave little boy and all of the men who saved her.
God bless this child you could not have done great you are such blessings to go and get help. Other kids or children would have panick .       God bless you young man Life Saver 🙏🙏🙏
Yes I’ve said it running outta breath and clear she is in there but officer how tf am i supposed to know if the car unlocced
Jesus loves u all❤
😢
Jesus is the way the truth and the life
Lord thank u fa saving mom and the lil fella did an awesome amazing job the people that rescue ❤❤❤
I pray she recover but she shouldn't be driving if she has seizure.
What a traumatic experience. I heard PTA can create also heroes for life.
Praise God
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
❤❤❤
His cries just broke my heart ❤️ he was brave and God bless this police officer
Her son saved  her by getting help🎉❤😢 brave boy.
That poor kid i felt their pain
Of course someone was in the car, the child told you help her hollered mom. Thank you Jesus for the officers that helped this Childs mom.
Take your time dude
I didn't like how we kept asking is somebody in there and then he asked is the car unlocked God damn man just go
😢
Yes indeed the boy helped to save his mother's life, but the real heroes are those men who went into the water and rescued that woman. Kudos to them.
Save her, quit asking questions!
What a great young man to keep a cool head and to be instrumental in saving his mom's life.  Bless them both, and bless those who responded and saved her.
How on earth did she survive that long underwater, with her body out of control???   I lost my breath just waiting for her to be brought out!
This is so sad. I hope she received the help she needed
Thank you Jesus for saving the life of mom and making her son and the officer ( Good Samaritan’s) her heroes!!   The panic on that child face was so heartbreaking, I wanted to cry😢.  God bless all of you! Mama, I pray you are good and giving God praise for saving your life🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
BUT GOD!!!!
Cops reaction time was so fking slow...
🙏🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹🌹🪷🪷🪷🪷
No one said thank you to the officers. You guys were very professional and efficient. Well done public servants.
The kid JUST said his mom was in there and he really still took his time to stand there and  yell if anyone was in there…. Fuck sakes
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Brave child but if the lady has seizure she shouldn't drive hope the lady is OK
Hearing the cries from this child to help his mom just broke my heart. I hope his mom is ok.
My heart hurts to hear the desperation in this child’s voice   Bravo to this officer as well
Praise God 👏
I think the boy already said she sunk in the car in the water. No need to ask, is she in there?🤔
Ohhhhhh
Why can’t cat manufactures out in some kind of device that will be alerted if the car is submerged in a certain amount of water that auto-unlocks the damn doors better yet OPENS them just a little so people can at least push there way out of 5 feet of water?!  I understood pressure but many more people go into shallow water like this or into ravines on sides of roads where pressure isn’t a major issue, hm🤔
No she is not there !!!! Hello the boy is saying she is there help her .
Thank you father God for placing that man at the right place at the right time! God is truly amazing!
Thank God!! ❤😢❤❤
”Is somebody in there” -most stupid thing to ever say YES OBVIOSLY SHE IS IN THERE THE CHILD SAID SO
God Bless her Son and the Officer 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Pero deja la camaraaaaaaa y ayuda ok😕🤦🏼‍♀️😡😱😱😮😨🇪🇸
Damn brings tears to my eyes! I experienced so many accidents during my 40 yrs of driving Stopped to help so many times saw so much death and pain ! Got bless this man and child I hope she survived!😢🙏
Is the cop brain dead?
I hope all is well for them
“Is she in there? Is the car unlocked? Is her insurance up to date? Are her tags expired? What’s her favorite color….”
God bless this precious boy and the Officer for saving this woman.  I pray she is OK.
😢PRAYING FOR HER RECOVERY AND HER SON
Prayers for a long Prosperous life for this Young strong Black child 🙏🏽
She Okay 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤
Everyday Hero's.
Omg , my worst nightmare !! God bless he’s amazing people
I take my hat off to this child I am so proud of you saving your 👩 I almost😢 happy tears
God bless you Sir 🙏🙏🙏
what was he carrying it seemed very small? is she okay now?
Thank u
That sounded like a White man, Saving a Black Woman, Where is this racism we always hear from people like Joy Reed, Sunny Hoston, Al Sharpton.
This is why the world is so corrupt and undivided because of everyone’s mindset and it’s sad
🙏🏾
Jesus things like this make me cry! Bless his soul, he’s warrior!
Cop didn’t seem to be in a hurry
😭😭😭😭
The boy is the hero ❤
''Is anyone in there'', No shit he just standing there crying for nothing. Still respect him though.
Heroes all the way❤
Bro, sitting in the back talking about is somebody in there while they said she fainted and she’s having a seizure?😂
I hope that she's ok. Brave young man to get his mama help.
Jesus, I  just relived the moments as a child when I  had to endure this with my mom
This poor baby boy, how incredibly brave he is. What a hero. I hope his Mom is okay.
There was someone in a bright color shirt already at the door trying to open it……..but not mentioned?
Poor baby 😢this is very emotional to watch
Pobrecito que sentimientos de dolor refleja, que todo haya salido bien😢❤
OMG😳😳😳😳😱😱😱😱😱
That person who stopped to help is a hero also, that little boy is a gift from God for his mom❤❤
It was a face sticking out the side of the vehicle when he said is anybody in there look at the driver side clearly you can see a face
I pray she's alright ❤❤❤❤
look at God!!! he sent an angel at the RIGHT TIME... to help - God was like, hold on help is on the way
This is sad, but if she is prone to having seizer's, why is she driving? She puts herself in danger and everyone else.
So glad cops stay calm.  It may drive some crazy but it’s what they do to get the job done. 💙
🙏🏻😢🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏻
Really, he had to ask, is she in there?  Is somebody in there? The kids had already told him she was having a seizure and was in there. SMH.
God bless this family..🙏🏾❤️💯💯💯💯💯
Boy a hero, but this man is g*y "she still in there?" Is askimg this mtfk
I'm a little upset by the officer's reaction, at first. His energy, in no way matched the boy's.  I realize it's  best to be calm, but i think he have shown some empathy when the boy first got to him.😮
Thank you Jesus for this child and the help of the man
God almighty this is officer this is a Angle from God 🙏🏿🙏🏿
I salute the young king, he wasn't playing about his momma!
Cop was like “but do I really have to help?”
God bless u & be with you all. Oli love u ❤
And Kamala Harris wants to defund police. Don’t forget that
Why doesn't the cop listen to the  kid he is being very slow! He could see the kid is traumatized.
At these times we don't care if your black or white or who you voted for. This is what makes America great.
Он плачет,у меня душа болит горит 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank God for the rescuers
The cop could have moved a bit faster though.
I Pray That She Is Okay
Y gracias a qué estas personas iban pasando si no pobre chico😢
Let’s thank the TWO men who actually saved her ???? Not enough mention of them. 🙄
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Glad he helped but why was he asking when the boy yelled over & over??!! Hope she is alive
There's an angel . That poor little boy , he is so brave .
Wow. Don’t drive if you’re prone to seizures. Both of them could have died, that child is lucky he got out.
🥹🥹🥹🫶🏾🙌🏾🌹
Thank you !
Thats a MID cop! Maybe racist ! But he was aorta for ed to do his job barely helping!!! What a weak police officer!!! No haste to help! Are all police this way??? Is he thinking,” i dont get paid enough for this!”???? Hes barely a good simaritan! Mid simaritan!!
Oh my GOD that poor poor child--!!! I'm frightened for him just watching this! God please grant him peace and comfort 🙏
Omg, this gives me chills!!!
Why was the cop moving so slow at first
This is why I don't drive anymore,,I have seizures....granted I understand that some folks still have to drive to live,I understand,thank God this didn't end in tragedy,brave and scared to death young man and officer doing what he had to do to save her
😢😢😢😢
He was trying to break the window that was so brave of him I pray that the lady is okay in a little boy is good😢
God Bless you Both, for saving his Mom❤❤❤❤
Let’s talk about the cop who acted quickly! The son is a hero for his mom! But the Cop is a hero to have acted selflessly! God bless all!
Thank You God 🙏🙌😢
😮😮😮😮😮😮
In the end gators got em all
This little boy brought me to tears. The desperation in his voice just broke my heart. He was so brave.
Did she live?
Well,did she live
I would have liked to see a little more hustle and sense of urgency from the cop just standing there asking if anyone was in there, but at least he eventually jumped in the water and helped so thankfully he did help but I’d have been losing my mind if I was that kid like “PLEASE HELP MY MOM I CANT GET THE DOOR OPEN!!” Glad they got her out of there and hope she makes a full recovery and gets someone else to drive for her from now on.
Merci à la personne qui a sauvé la dame❤😊
Brave hero child and officers.
What a great job from the kid and officer God bless you all 😊
💝💝💝❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹💖💖💖❤️❤️❤️💗💗💗
Praise this little boy !! And Everyone that saved this Mother BLESS  all
Do like the Beatles "let it be" 😅
God bless this cop for rescuing this woman. O M G!
Letting the kid get back in the water could have been fatal. SMH. Thanks for whatever you did but you telling him he had to punch it, step it up, get her up here, was really sad. Thank GOD They both survived.
What a shame no sense of urgency… asking if the door is unlocked???? WTF , thank God for the Good Samaritan
man i hope that kids alright i know that was traumatizing, happy he had someone to help him nearby
Thankfully the cop was there to supervise
What does that cop not understand about “my mom is sunk in the car” and then proceeds to ask if someone is in there…
Both of them played a important role thank god she was saved god bless both
Move your ass Gomer Pyle ffs!
❤❤❤
Has always been my worst nightmare as someone who does not know how to awim.
Thanks to the son for holding it together and muchThanks to the officer who came to the rescue
That police officer was annoyingly hesitant wasn’t he!? Asking sunken people in a car if they’re alright and in there…😮 seconds saves lives!
Did the mom make it??? Just curious about people doing what should be done!!! Seriously, I can’t think of this any other way!!! I would have saved her for certain!!
Why he asking is someone in there is she is there it was not the police officer at all 😢😢 but they job is to what
Thank you GOD! Her son was so brave and the good samaritan took the time to listen and act! Praise GOD!
God Bless Everyone Involved 🙏
Estou em😭

Scary and amazing rescue, the child is also extremely brave for seeking help 😮😮
Oh my that poor child and mother. Thank God for help , I hope she’s ok. 🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻
Oh my heart  The fear in his voice and face broke me.
Defund the police until you need them.
Thank God for this rescuers too❤️🙏🙏🙏🌺
Are american cops good for anything? Little guy clearly said that she is there and the cop is wasting time with questions...
Her license needs to be revoked ASAP!!!
Is she okay???
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️
My God can the cop move any slower?
Heart stopping moment.  I hope she’s ok.  GOD bless this boy and his mom❤
What a brave, beautiful soul. ❤
My God, bless his heart. I know that was scary for him. Thank God for the good samaritan.

❤❤
God bless you guys❤😢
What a brave little boy. God bless him for saving he’s mom ❤️❤️
The cop sure acted like he didn't want to get wet at first. Standing on the shore asking if someone is in there over & over knowing he was already waved down by the boy yelling his mom was IN THE WATER. He sees the girl strggling in the water too trying to get her out. You think she swimming fool? Then I know he thought about tossing that WindowPunch to the boy
Everyone is crediting the kid, and he deserves the praise, but the officers also responded fast, broke the window, got her out and provided cpr which saved her. They deserve some praise too
Главное сняли!
Car is not submerged.  She has plenty of time
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Obrigada,  por ter parado para ouvir o pedido de socorro deste corajoso menino e ter salvo o seu bem mais precioso que é a sua .
Thank you Jesus ❤
Im just wondering if his mom should have been driving because sometimes people with seizure disorders are not allowed to drive
*audible screaming and yelling*  Cop: is somebody in there?
I wish we could know about her outcome
My God My God. This Really Broke My Heart To See This Baby Go Through That
Wondrous human drama. Did that punch not work under water?
Did he lock the doors on the way out?🤔
😔🙏
I’m glad this content was shared. The boy definitely showed maturity, and the officer saved his mom’s life. What a good guy!
So was she saved?
Protecting and Serving. HEROES  LOVE
❤
Thank GOD for the young man and the brave cop that has a good heart. May GOD Bless You Officer!!!❤
Omg I hope everyone is ok  Brave son good job
Why is the cop taking sweet as time. The boy clearly said shes in the water
Praise God for good people!
😢😢😢
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽that she is alright
Ужасно , выжила его мама??????
I hope she’s okay!! Did she live? Her son loves her so much, he kept it together enough to tell the cop. I was not this strong when I was young, amazing for him, I do hope he saved her.
Poor kid. That sure is a damn story to tell people when you're older.
Praise God that he cared about people, a citizen rather than race. Hero honors to you officer ❣️🙏🏽✝️🩸🩸🩸🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💙💙💙
I’m crying cause he was panicking so hard man
Bless his heart! 😢
That's boy was raised right he going to be a good husband to his wife
Glas rhe baby knew to get help. Happy the officer helped instead of waiting for resue and paramedics.🙏🏾🙏🏾
Was she saved??
😢🙏🏽
❤❤😢😢😢
I know first responders are taught to remain calm but they can’t forget empathy. That baby needed reassurance. He stated mom is in the car needs rescue and medical attention. He even knew what happened to articulate seizure. My mom is epileptic and I know the fear of saving your mom.
Thank you Jesus 😢
BLESS HIS LITTLE HEART!!!!! I PRAY THE LADY IS SAFE & OK
Misericórdia meu Deus
Misericórdia meu Deus
Misericórdia meu Deus
ffs it was not deep at all, some people are lazy... at least try
Did she make it? Anyone know?
Thank God for her precious son and the cop and EMT's 🙏🙏🙏 WOW!! So scary!!
Thank God the man was there and the child to Amen!!!!! Thank you our  Father!!!!
My son died at home, and his 2 boys were too young to help, He died from having a seizure, and he went into cardiac arrest and died from a heart attack 😢
Was everyone OK? Good cops are awesome.  Bad cops should take note
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Me angustia tanto el niño llorando ojalá todo esté ok
Lord… as an adult watching someone you love receive CpR is devastating… as a child watching your mother be worked on is to traumatic. I pray for this child’s state of mind, his continued strength and and his future!!
Bless that sweet baby boy!  Breaks my heart for him. I hope his mama is okay.
❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
The urgency and terror in the boys expression and voice says it all.
Salute to fast decision making of little boy and Texas Cop,
😢❤
God please keep her in your arms 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Aww this poor baby. I pray the mom is ok . He will never forget this . Thank you officer for helping the young man
Good Samaritan??? Seems like a slow moving cop. How else would there be a body cam??
Is the car unlocked dude cmon
Did she live?
Thanks to God her son was able to get help …… Now mom Why jeopardize yourself your children knowing you have a medical condition seizures Lord thank you for covering them
That would be so scary!💕
Do we know if she made it?
❤❤❤❤
So what the f was he asking that traumatized kid questions for? Like go help.
Okay but where is this cop’s sense of urgency?!?
Thank God he got help for her, but why was she driving if she’s epileptic?
Wonder if she lives dang that was intense y'all show anything
That cop was dumb asking if someone was in there when she clearly had a seizure said the boy!
Poor baby boy
Little Man will grow up and become an Ace Firefighter and Paramedic himself...🎉
God bless mom and son!
OMG….
He was moving too slow for me😢😢😢
What happened to the mother
Blessed brave young man 🙏🏽
What a brave little boy. He definitely saved his mama's life. He should be given an award
She all cops aren't bad.  There are still some good ones out here.  The young man and the officer saved her life.
Obrigado. Pela. ajudar..Amém. Senhor Jesus Cristo. Amém.
Thank God for  and God Bless the people who helped save this brave boys mom.
Is she okay now???
"My mom is in the car, she had a seizure, she sunk in the water" "Is someone in there?"  I nearly threw my phone seeing the cop just stand there
Oooh my sooo sad
Dude the cop should have not hesitated the way he did.   Uuugh!!!!   Makes me upset
Nice to see a cop doing a fantastic job for a change. Good for her son and the cop both saving her.
Thank God for her son stopping someone to saving her ❤.
If all of you were there and knew what was going on why  Didn't you help them. Keyboard Warrior's at your worst.
A courageous and brave child. Thanks also to the first responders
God bless that sweet boy and the samaritans that helped. Praying the mom is ok. ❤
AYYY EL NIÑO ME HIZO LLORAR, POBRECITO, CUANTA ANGUSTIA
Man it took him a while to respond tbh 😂
You know it's a terrible feeling to have seizures because I do since 1st  in high school. It takes you a while to get on the right meds, to stop having the seizures, if you're lucky. Then sometimes you've got to increase the dose, or even change to a different med. It can be a long process, and time-consuming, plus all the tests that are done. They want to know what kind of seizures you have. It was a terrible ordeal her son had to witness, seeing his Mom dying in front of his eyes, and that is a very scary thing. Thank God some people helped them out. My heart goes out to them.
Praise Jesus  I am glad they saved her 🙌🏽🙌🏽😘
Did his mother survive?
I don't know what all is around this area but thank God there were people in the area who were able to help his mom. I can't imagine the terror this poor boy was feeling.
100 PLUS 🌟  FOR THIS PRECIOUS LITTLE BOY A TRUE HERO ALONG WITH THESE WONDERFUL MEN [TRUE HEROS] THAT SAVED THIS LITTLE BOYS MOTHER.   THESE HEROS SPARED THIS PRECIOUS LITTLE BOY FROM HORRIFIC SUFFERING THAT WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM IN A LIVING NIGHTMARE 🥀
Thank God for saving her 🙏 🙌 ❤️ 😌and God for sending his angels praise God
боже,  бедный ребёнок, как же ему страшно😢
Why is he asking if someones in there? He already said his mom is.  Stop wasting time and *GO*
без Бога мучаются а служыл бы Богу это бы неслучилосьбы
This is extremely traumatizing for me to watch. You are leaving us wondering if that women survived for which chances were zero. As somebody who lost their mother in a carcrash I wish you didn't show me this video. What is that giving anybody? Is this about clicks???
Why did you cut it off when you did?
This baby spoke so clear while he was out of breath and terrified. I’m happy he wasn’t scared to trust the police in this situation in a world where Law Enforcement  gets a bad reputation. Shows that they all aren’t bad. Thank you to the officer and EMS for saving his mother. 🥰
It's a good idea for everyone to have a window breaker on your Keychain
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Child needs more credit😊
He is their guadian angel disguised as that man.
That cop did not wanna get in that water... "is she in THERE??" *kid cries banging at window shouting "mom"* "Is somebody in there??"
Brave men and women  in this world  ,that shows  love, God is in the midst
Thank you thank you thank you
Thank God, thank you sir for showing  love and compassion  ,bless your beautiful  heart
Bravery and selflessness.  I hope his momma is ok..thanks to all the rescuers!
Why was he asking if somebody's in there like what did he expect them to be able to answer while they're underwater? And I heard the voice tell him that she was having a seizure
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😢
My God prayers for the family hope they are all ok. 😢
With God help thank you police and son
Whyis she driving with seizure
People who have seizures should not be driving. It's not safe for them or others.😢
That poor baby is so scared, hurts my heart.. how is his mama?
God bless her son the Good Samaritan omg my daughter has seizures and she drives this is scary Lord I hope this women made it ♥️🙏🏽
This is a scary thought for a person that  battles with epilepsy..
Did she definitely survive? I hope that sweet angel isn’t too traumatised and that mama is feeling better xx
❤🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️💯
the boy just screaming for help and the cop doing stupid question like 😡
Salute police and praise to the son. 👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾🫡
🙏
THE Boy is a hero for saving his mom.But let's just talk about.The man also is a hero❤❤❤
Hats off to the young man, he saved her mothers life by getting help. However, am I the only one who is a bit disturbed by how long the police officer took to react and get her out? I mean he just stood there and yelled "is anybody in there?". I would have ran to the car IMMEDIATELY. Every wasted second could prove fatal to a drowning person.
One Our God Amazing Miracleous Focus Ppl..!!!😢  ❤❤❤Stop always thinking neg bout police officers 😮... They're human souls as well🎉🎉🎉
Thank God for the officer but uhhhh yeah!!! All those questions bro. Just jump in and act as if it was your mom. 🤷🏽‍♀️
God bless you guys
Hallelujah Thank You Lord For Saving Your Child 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Jesus loves y'all! I used to have Acid Reflux, and I had trauma and depression, but Jesus healed me inside and out. He xhanged my personality. He saved my life. He can do the same for you.
Thank you Jesus for her son, that he did not get stuck in the car sp he could get help for his mother. Amen
This made me cry
Oh that poor baby ,broke my heart seeing the terror on his face ,praise the Lord for him keeping it together to give the officer info ,my child you are a hero
Thank God that this child found help for his Mom!❤
❤
God bless this young brave boy who saved his mother’s life, also the man who jumped in first gear to save the young boys mother in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth amen 🙏
Thank U Jesus
To all these snowflakes want to defend the police.
Some law enforcement do care about all people
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
To all the people who hate the police, but support criminals..... Thank you for the brave officers who put their lives at risk for strangers.
Everyone criticizing this guy, he's asking questions while walking in! Is the car unlocked is ac reasonable question, if it's unlocked the options for entry change. He's asking is somebody in there, we don't know how far away he had to run for help. There's a chance she got out and is either flouting out in the water or on the bank.  if  fear made the kid forget something, time is wasted. Only bad question is one not asked.
Very sorry. May God heals your mother 👩.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh my heart. This poor baby. Hope everyone is ok.
Wow. Thank God for the brave officers, EMS, the good Samaritan, the little boy, hope the baby & mom are ok
Dang that officer asks too many questions like wasting time… but bless his heart for getting her out! Poor baby was so scared for his mama! 😓
I have the chills WOW AMEN 🙏
Сколько отчаяния! Сердце разрывается за него и его маму
СПАСЛИ ЛИ МАМУ.
God Bless him ❤
🦸🦸🦸🦸🦸 super héroes 👏👏👏👏
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😊
Si votre véhicule se dirige dans l’eau, ouvrez les fenêtres le plus vite possible. Seul moyen d’équilibrer la pression pour pouvoir ouvrir la portière.  Sinon, prévoir un marteau brise vitre dans votre véhicule.
Is she alive
I hope she gives her heart to Jesus Christ if hadn't already because Jesus Christ needs us all to repent of our sins because he died on a cruel cross for us all we don't need to go to hell but go to heaven praise God.
Man! Made me cry!! His lil heart was so scared!🙏🙏🙏🫶🏾🫶🏾
of course somebody’s in there 🙄
Why was he so slow in the beginning..."Is somebody in there?"  Um...yeah that's why the boy came and got you!! But glad he finally got with it once he saw for himself.  Idk why some ppl don't believe others when they are frantic and begging for help desperately.
The young man, the officer, and the other person assisting are all heroes.  Your qujck thinking, bravery, and selfless act of love saved not only one life but kept a family. Thank you for your service, officer. 😢❤
Alguém sabe dizer se a mãe da criança sobreviveu?
Espero este  bien grasias por ayudar ❤❤❤❤
Tnx God and great cops!
Who would be filming instead of helping?
What go you think cop? The boy is begging you to help his mom!!
J'ai mal au cœur pour cette enfant es les personnes qui sont dans la voiture
My God I pray she’s ok good baby he got help ❤

Удивительно, что кого то спасли, учитывая, как не решено полиция действовала😮. Ребенок умничка, если бы он физически мог, то он бы ее спас сам❤

The boy cam goin through it 😂😂
❤❤❤
Oh my Lord that child screams out “help my mom” it brought me to pain in my heart.
WoW! That was gut wrenching to hear & see, thankful for her son, that maintained his composure in order to get help & thankful for the officer and the other gentleman that were able to remove his Mom from the vehicle. ❤

That poor boy ❤🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
OMG Praying she is okay 🙏🏼
I’m glad that man was there  But what’s with all the questions the mother was drowning  The baby was loud and clear  When he said mama please . Broke my heart .  The desperation in his heart for his mama . Stop with all the questions and help the both of them  Bittersweet situation   We are all thankful for All three of you  Turned out good . She’s ok , baby boy will be ok
Wow❤
I want to thank the police officer that came to the rescue, sir thank you for your service ❤❤❤
How about promoting these type of videos around election time.
I had to say something. This young msn saved his mothers by flagging down a cop
And this experience is going to completely change his life forever!! ❤ I wish them well. 💜♾️🙌🏻
Texas cops are awesome.  California cops would pull you out of the car and beat you to a pulp and then claim that you were resisting arrest or that they thought you were armed or any other bull shit but they could fabricate.  And of course their body cams were magically not working the entire time.
Praise almighty God AMEN
Thank God, he protect n serve
Brave young man, I hope you & your Mom are ok🙏🏽
Мальчик герой😢😢😢 его голос раздирающий 😢😢😢Хранит вас Бог, 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤
This is wonderful to watch because her son actually saved his Momma's life thank you Jesus 😢
He is such a loving son, I hope and pray that his mother will be OK. God bless the officers who rescue her. 😢
Poor kid had to experience this. I am glad that there both okay.
Could the cop be anymore lax
Jesus has no shortage of heroes
God bless this boy for helping save his mom. Praying they both are ok. 🙏❤️‍🩹
Yes the boy save his mom but no one speaking about the officer risking his lives  to save here smh
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
IF WE COULD SOMEHOW! ADOPT THE CONCEPT OF EMPATHIE AND CARE FOR HUMAN LIFE, DAM! We would be halfway home to a more civilized society instead of bigotry! and hate! I wish we would all collectively get over ourselves be done with the BS and actually work on a better society. 🤷🏽‍♀️Some say that I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one. (John Lennon.)👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

Primero pregunta si hay alguien allí... . No hombre el coche se iba manejando solo.
Is somebody in there?? I don’t want to get wet if there isn’t …..smh
Did she live?
❤❤❤❤unknown heroes ❤❤❤❤
Baby boy and the cops saved his mom. Considering the circumstances baby boy got the message over loud and clear. 😢🥺🙏🏾 for mom
Both are heroes the son and the man that went to the rescue. Now days you don’t know what to believe as far as that man knew it could have been a trap to kill him or rob him.
God is good hate the fact he has to go thru this but he is stronger then he thinks God bless him
Comment la voiture est arrivé là elle roulait trop vite peut-être
Did the mom make it?😢
That lil boy is an angel 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
God bless this child! He's so brave to get outta the sunken car to get help for his mom. God bless all of them who helped!
That cop 🤔
Graças a Deus ficaram bem !  Obrigada @bhumphries1360.
That’s cop was a kind idiot in my opinion.. why ask if she’s in there if that’s what you e already been told
Cop took his time though
Oh, my heart is breaking for that boy!! He must have been so scared!! God bless his heart!!
Thank you Jesus
Obrigada por salvar essa mãe!
OMG, that poor kid.  I hope they were able to save his mom! 😮
😢😢😢😢
I have diabetic seizures. I'm a single mom. My daughter seeing me and having to call EMS breaks me. I can't forgive myself. Poor brave little boy.
I hope she lived ! Growing up with a sister, who had seizures from the time we were kids it’s terrifying. I can identify with that poor little boy how terrifying for him bless his heart I hope she survived.
omg😢
Thank you fellas for helping rescue his other 😢❤
People that have seizures should not be able to drive at all. I mean like even having them maybe 1 time every 3 years
My heart goes out to everyone here today
This is why we cannot afford to hate based on skin color. We see blacl and white here doing the human thing and that's what we all are, human. Mazel to all of them! God bless!!
Prayers over this child and his mom❤
Wow. Tic Tok.
God bless them all 🙏🏽❤️
❤😢😮
He kept saying she was there!!!!
😢😢😢😢😢😢
Did she make it???🙏🏽
AND THE POLICEMAN ASKING IS SOMEBODY IN THERE???MOVE YOUR ASS MAN!!!!
Oh my!! That poor woman -and her very scared son!!  Tears up my heart! He saved her life! Praise God!!
What did he stop and ask again, is somebody in there?!!!!!
Misericórdia Jesus
Poor baby! That had to be terrifying for him! Thank GOD he was able to get out and there was someone able to get her.
Gosh is there and ending
That baby was brave and got out to get help, do anyone know the final results; I pray she made it.❤️🙏
🙏🏿🙏🏿
Dios lo bendiga..se salvaron todos??
OMG that baby boy was terrified 😮
Thank God for that brave kid, and the good ppl that helped❤
😢 oh my God
Es El padre eterno quien permitió que el niño saliera ileso para  también salvar a su mamá
Gloria a nuestro señor jesucristo
This child & the police officer are HEROS 👍🏽💪❤️
People who saw the minion   👇
Jesus
God bless you all. I hope she survived.
I’m just tearing up. God please help her.
Deus te abençoe sempre! ❤❤❤❤
Judging by the level of water and the car she didn’t survive.
He still moved to slow
God bless him and his moma
Data e local por favor
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😟😟😟😟😟😟😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏anjos salvadores
I know the cop helped but why the slow mo stupid questions first?  He told you she was IN there and if you just get over there you will know if it’s locked and can devise a plan. Why? The boy would t have even had to tell me. I’d have jumped in that water no questions asked.  I’d have been in the water
They got her out but only God knows if there was brain damage. Not enough time for oxygen , especially under water.  Strong brave child.
Thank you sir for saving her life😊
Really why even take the time to ask if somebody in there. Just go there asap 😅 the kid already told him.
كنت حقا شجاعا ❤
GOD STILL HAS ANGELS ON THIS EARTH!! GOD BLESS THIS SWEET CARING MAN!!
Omg 😱
Cop sure did take his time ... Guess he had to think about if wanted to get his uniform dirty
Father God please watch over this lady and her son please God save their life and give them the strength and Jesus name Amen 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
God cover this Family 🙏🙏
yeah he did cuz that cop was slow af
God bless that man for having the right spirit.  Hopefully, all is well and the mother survived.
❤❤❤
The cop is stupid the chick saved her. U kept asking wasting time of her drowning instead of jumping into action. As if the mom was gonna call for help under the water
And that is exactly why you can't get a driver's license if you have seizures.
😢😢😢😢
Such a brave baby boy! Great job son!
That man was slow as fuck like yeah someone’s in there dumbass
SEE NOT ALL COPS ARE BAD. ❤
He is The angel sent to get help from other angel heroes ❤😢
JESUS SAVES All Praise and Glory belongs to THE SAVIOR GOD ALMIGHTY
The rescuer must have a medal
The cop was moving a little slow
🙏🏿
OH Sweet boy! 😢
😮❤
Does anyone know if she is OK?, the sons' pleads broke my heart 💔 Thank you, @bhumphries1360 for the update,  I pray she'll makes a full recovery 🙏🏼 ❤️ 🥹
Si tienes ataques no debe conducir.
Beautiful boy ❤😟
Thank goodness help arrived. God always have the right person at the right time praise God thank you sir.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Good kid really appreciate the help with his mom.
Poor baby boy! Such desperation in his voice. Bless him and his momma!
Amen thank you Father God for her safety
He sure took his time 🤔
The cop is so dumb why would you ask if somebody in there if the boy crying and jump your ass in and open the front driver door?
The child  😰😥😢😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Any updates on the mom
This poor boy , this will be with him forever . The trauma from the incident. I pray he gets some therapy.  Good job young man u saved your mom.
Praise God for that young man
Does anyone know  if she survived and doing okay?
That babies voice panicking broke my heart. I’m crying 🥹🙏🏽
The kid helped to save her too!
When rescued, you must be calm, as this policeman did. Good job 👍
Yeah, and how long does it take the police officer a good Samaritans to get her out?
God was definitely there and sent these angels to help. God bless them all
Thank you for helping that lady. Her son will never forget what you did for his mom.
No more driving, please.  Thank God this young man was able to get help.
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Do we know if the mom survived?
The Lil boy did more than that cop did, why he was moving so slow for? The boy done told you his momma in the car having a seizure and she's in the water to help her tf you standing there asking still? SMH poor kid was going through it waiting on an adult to help him smdh
Q bienn q los pudo rescatar..pero m intriga saber quién va por ahí con una cámara y graba estas cosas..que casualidad...
Protect, and Serve….
Thank God for that brave child and the immediate   response from the officer! They both deserve some type of Honor! ❤ 🙏🏾
oo my Lord
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Зачем выдают права людям, у которых в любую минуту может случиться припадок?! Эта женщина подвергает опасности и себя, и всех вокруг!!  А если бы она ехала не возле реки, а по оживлённой трассе, то тогда бы и сыну не пришлось бежать за помощью!
🫡🫡🫡🫡
God bless the mother and her son to fight and overcome this horrific accident 😰😰🙏🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝
God bless this cop and the little boy ❤
Look at God!!❤❤
Bravo !!!!
Man this broke my heart.
Quick tip:….. if ever trapped in a car like this or needing to rescue a person from a car like this, note, the car is designer with the engine in the front to push weigh head down and the trunk hollow to create air in the back! NEVER BREAK THE FRONT OR SIDE WINDOWS….if ur trapped inside a sinking car or need to get into a sinking car ALWAYS BREAK THE BACK WINDOW!!!TRYING TO FIGHT THE PRESSURE OF THE WATER TO OPEN THE DOORS WILL ONLY MAKE IT HARDER TO OPEN AND SINK THE CAR FASTER
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
That poor boy I hope momma is okay 😢❤❤❤❤❤❤
AMEN AND THANK YOU LORD JESUS CHRIST OF NAZERETH FOR YOUR PROTECTION OVER THIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY AND YOUNG MAN.
❤🙏🏾
I was just in a situation like this the other day a lady passed out from Chromes disease her 6 yr old came screaming down the street for help luckily we were there she definitely saved her moms life 😢❤
Is she In there? Is somebody I there? DIDNT THE BOY TELL YOU IN THE BEGINNING?!?
God bless her boy. ❤ he stayed so strong!
The cop should not have wasted time yelling “is someone in there.” I’m glad that boy stood up and said “yes my mom help her!”  He literally just told the cop what had happened
Damn, could he have moved any slower?!!! 😡
I'm in 😢 watching the despair in the child's face and hearing the law enforcement officer telling dispatch to tell EMS 🚑 to step it up! I wish those tools came with every car, but it's important to get 1.  Praying everyone is safe & recovering 🙏🏽
Police never do nothing bra
DIOS bendiga muchísimo a ése niñito ❤❤❤ y a su mami ❤❤❤
❤ 🙏 🫂
Love Hero stories ❤
Everyone keeps saying he saved his moms life. Did she live?
She shouldn't be driving if she's prone to seizures
I dont care fucc that law if it wasnt for the other two ppl help the cop would of let her drown he talking about she in there the biy literally saying she in there
Omgggggg bless him for being there poor baby boy bless himmm
😢😢😢😢😢 graças a Deus
Who's filming this rescue but not helping?
OMG.. pray to God that she's okay.. thank you for the person that helped her...
🙏🏾 Thank you officer's amazing job an what amazing kid great work
Damn racist cop again.  You will not be seeing this on CNN. Oh hell no.
He making the baby do the work to save his mom rather to be a really man and an adult and help a child America shows over and over how they constantly choose to treat blacks and how there is no concern to help protect or assist im just saying what a constant failure
As u can clearly see and understand how blacks are truly treated he don’t care that he is a child and constantly asking for help how many times no since of urgency here what’s so ever very said dramatically traumatizing and what an absolute mental  devastation how he has to ask over and over and I hope this cop don’t think he is any type of hero

Dios mio que angustia..eso es vocación con coraje.
Is this some type of joke. What they pulled out looks like a snake.
Parabéns a este homem valente e bondoso que salvou a mãe do menino! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I hope the city awarded this sweet child a medal for saving his mother's life. What a courageous child.
Thank God for good ppl that will still help!  This little boy may have just helped save his mom's life by getting out of the sinking car and getting her help. I pray for them both and for their family. I hope his mom and this lil boy are doing ok now.❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤
💔💔💔🙏🏾🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙏🏾
Gott segne Helfer 🙏💐
Cop or who saved her needs a high recognition on this ONE ....WOW 😮
I read in the comments that the mother is recovering! May God protect and heal this woman and bless her beautiful child 🙏🏾
Someone is dying and you're recording video what the hell you're
Praises to TMHG. Good teamwork 👏
Poor baby🥺
yeah and she’s dead because of the white officers were too relaxed.
Thankfully he helped, but why did he ask several times is someone in there. The boy says his Mom was many times.
How did the car end up upside down. ??
Неужели нельзя было убрать с рук телефон и двумя руками помогать? Но к счастью всё хорошо❤
Thank you for saving his momma ❤❤
I hope she's ok. That little boy was so terrified but saved her. Thanks to that brave man who saved her. She was having a seizure before the water. 😮❤
God bless you sir God bless the family ❤
Dang.....it seemed like that device took a long time to break window?
You did brilliantly my boy 👍.!! If you hadn’t of got to the Police as quickly as you did then it couldve been such a bad outcome! WELL DONE SWEETHEART ⭐️
My God My God!!
He wanted her to drown 🤦🏾‍♀️ thank god for her son being persistent.
You cannot tell me that God does not show up on time. Thank God for saving the little boy and his mother.
Cop doesn’t listen very well…kid tells him mom’s sunk, in the water, having a seizure…cop goes to car and says “is anyone in there?!”
But the cop was moving so slow 😫
No please take ur god damn time my guy
Showing my child this video… this kid is the gold standard. Way to stay calm to the officer. Outstanding rescue. Hope mom is recovering well!
Of course there is someone in the vehicle he clearly stated it as the young man was trying to catch his breath
West orange wow not to far from me
Like I said God has Angel's everywhere 🙏
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
✨🤍✨
How amazing that God sent someone to the right place at the right time.  Thank you sir for being a part of this miracle. ❤
The fact they went and said is anybody in here like she’d answer is beyond me like either you thought you were lied to and being set up or you’re a prick
Good samaritans are amazing good to see decent people still exist
He's so brave, is she ok? God bless them both.  Thank God for the office.
As a mother with epilepsy this hit hard as hell
So grateful for children my kids saved my life as well I had a heart attack in the shower my child who had autism called 911 and her uncle y’all these kids is more prepared than we think sometimes sad momma bears we want to protect them but they be saving us
The cry of this boy melts my heart to save  is mother
Drove me crazy that he asked if someone was in there as the boy just told him his mother was in the car having a seizure
Heureusement qu’il y ait encore de bonnes personnes
The kid told him what's going on .and the cop saying is anybody in there .he just bloody told him
Bless his heart ❤😢
This is why people who have seizures shouldn't drive. You never know when it's going to happen and you put lives in jeopardy.
GRATIDÃO SENHOR JESUS CRISTO ❤❤❤
🙏
No one's in there, he's just hysterical 😢
I must learn how to swim 😢
Why dnt they ever show the whole rescue
Cop doing his job wouldn't say good Samaritan beside that's an insult to the Samaritan if you understood who they were
The young man clearly telling to help and who is in there and fool so scared himself of going in the water knowing time is precious tf…
“Is somebody in there!?” He just clearly told you 😒
The cop asking twice “is somebody in there?” Wtf.  No sense of urgency. The boy just said his mom is in there!  Brave brave boy.
That cop may need hearing aids, her son said she was in the car in the first sentence. Not to mention how slow he moved
People with seizers should not drive vehicles unless they are permitted by their doctors
Oh gott  Wie schlimm gottseidank holt der JUNGE  HILFE Der Alptraum für jeden . Danke dass sie helfen  danke ❤
I can't believe the are still good cops in the  US
Angels come in different forms 😢
Omg my chest 😢 thank God!
People who have seizures shouldnt drive.
Cop keep asking dumb as questions….go look!!!
🙏🏽💜💫
Thank you Jesus  ❤    y'all got me crying   Blessings to y'all 🙏
Praise God for police and first responders. Selfless!
If he’s telling you( officer)  his momma is in the car, why the hello is you asking is someone in there, take your azz in the water and see, instead of having that baby, pleading frantically like to help her!!
Gracias  mi Dios
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙌🏿🙌🏿✊🏿👏🏿💪🏾💌🌷🙏🏾🙏🏾..it was so sad and heart broking 💔..When Jesus say yes no body can say no 🙏🏾
I thought epileptics weren't allowed to drive ? I'm UK based, so maybe it's different elsewhere.
That's funny, the cop knows she's having a seizure underwater and the door has to be unlocked because the kid got out, he just wasted precious seconds asking dumb questions. Idiot
Car :drowning  He : is somebody in there. 😂
That baby deserves to be recognized by the city and a trust fund.
Policiais bundao 😢😢😢
Respect
God blessed that child and his mother,  good job officer.  Psalms 91:11 New King James Version (NKJV)  For He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways
Such a hero! ❤gave me chills such a smart lil man! God bless him and his mom and all who came to her aide! You can she the fear all over this child’s face!! Quick thinking!
Could this guy move any slower??? I don't care that it all ended well! He did not have the urgency he should have had! Also, Why ask if somebody is in there when the boy already told you so? WTF man!
Thank you Father God for the officer. To the officer thank you so very much and I pray God keeps you covered!
Love you ,bless you , years ago my dad drowned nobody could save him. This brings my heart great joy ❤
😢😢😢 good job lil man and the officer I salute
How did the kid get out of the car?
Is stupid the Police or hándicap.?
"is somebody in there?" 🙄🙄 Duh the boy jus told u that his mom is in there!!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Praise God. Bless those who helped this mom
Meu Deus 😢😢😢🙏🏻
What chu doing bro jump in that water and get to work bro was hesitating for a minute 💀
😢😢😢hay pobrecito que miedo seguro es su padre quien esta atrapado .....😢
How they escaping the gators
❤❤❤❤❤
Dem ma😊
He said my mom had a seizure and is in the water the cop sees the car and ask “is someone in there” wtf do u think the little boy was saying dummy
That babe  has me in tears he love his mom an wS not ready to lose her God bless  him and his family
Why is a woman with seizures driving with her children in the car?
The cop saved her¿ 😮 Nah, her son saved her the police just help. That how I see it at least 🤷‍♀️
"Is somebody in there?", "is the car unlocked?"................ the little boy is literally telling him his mom is in there having a seizure.....
It is not the first time that I have seen an intervention by people in the police force who are incompetent to act and intervene
That poor kid man.....He saved him Moms life....100%. I hope he has had nothing but an easy happy life from then on. Poor baby. He was SO desperate. That cop was at the right place in the right time! Thank GOD.
How the hec is being filmed when the driver is in danger.
God bless them all 🙏
And some want to defend the police
Thank God this little boy is so! so! Brave, he helped save his mom, thank God
The little boy just told this trash somebody in their you hollering to see if anybody in there God forgive these demons
You gotta give it to em, he went straight into that water with only one intention
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
God is good
I have epilepsy and many people still drive even if they aren’t supposed to. This boy was so brave
What a good young man.  Happy he still has his mama.
Right place, right time, right attitude.  Right on! 🙏✊️
I know how that is for mom to be driving in traffic and have a seizure I’ve experienced that fear of like what to do next but thank God the cop able to save her!!!
Blessing 🙌 praise God for them and her son 🙏
👏👏👏
One seconds are crucial for survival. Why was he moving so slow appreciate the rescue but it just makes you think
GRAZIE PER AVERLI SALVATI DIOBEMEFICA TUTTI❤
Wow that's a miracle no doubt. T.y for these that put their lives into danger to save ours when needed❤
This is what real heroes do❤ serve and protect
Poor baby, so scared for his mom 💔
Poor kid, that would be scary
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Poor kid
💔💔💔
Glórias a Deus gratidão por salvar essas pessoas
ANGELS amongst us! A Savior indeed. Bless that "stranger".
I mean he is doing his job I don't really know why the caption says Good Samaritan cop cuz he's a cop and it's kind of his job to do these kinds of things😂
Amen
Thar man truly  has a heart  thank you for helping  may God bless you 🎉🎉❤❤
That poor kid, his quick reaction even under distress saved his mom.   Ps: Aa parent to an Epileptic child, this is my biggest fear when he begins to drive.
😢😢😢 pobrecito ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Just maybe if prone to having seizures, one shouldn't be driving as precaution.  What if having a seizure and killed others in a head on collision or run of the road and ran some child over. What ever the scenarios could be, should they be behind the wheel or operating moving equipment. It only takes once to die at someone else's negligence. What if the boy couldn't get out to get help, both would be in paril. Precaution is the best option.
God bless his little soul ❤🙏🏼
Rn un caso asi se pide refuerso de inmediato con elicoptero
Hay me dio miedo pense que saldria un cocodrilo 🐊😢😮
I had a guy pass in my truck once and the cop showed up before EMS and he was playing with my protection instead of helping me. God Bless this Cop!!!!!
Yes somebody in there😮😢
I read the comments and I think to myself what kind of world do I live in if the child is a hero.? Anyone that can think to save someone else is a hero! Too many times I see people turn their face the other way so they don't have to see what's in front of them.
Lord Jesus bless his heart ❤️
Thank God for his grace and mercy
You are a great man for saving that beautiful father and baby. May the Lord Jesus repay that awesome gesture a million times more.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This lady birth her own angel❤!
Great work to everyone who assisted in saving that child's mother.
Cop is too damn slow
Могли бы тросом прикрепить машину и вытащить быстро.полезли бесполезно и двери не открыли и залезть в машину не смогли.Снимали только.
A prueba de agua 💧🔫

Brave son!!
Хорошо,что мама омталась жива !!!❤ Спасибо сыну , который отчаянно кричал и звал на помощь !!!🎉❤😊
Oh this poor kid for going through all that, he truly saved his and his Mama's life. Such a good son and good cops/Samaritans for avoiding this becoming a tragedy.
I’m glad the mother was saved. I’m sad the priority was making the video.
Glory be to God for the strength and courage he gave the boy to get out for help .🙏 !
Brave young man
Hope that little boy gets to talk with someone.  That had to be so scary for him.  Thank you for helping them both!
🙇🏻‍♀️🙇🏻‍♀️🙇🏻‍♀️🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
JESUS IS LORD…AMEN🙏🙏🙏
Brought me to tears😢

Thank you for helping this family ,texting from South Africa
Como é bom saner que tudo terminou bem ne??
Je ne comprends pas que le sauveteur se filme. N'a-t-il pas  d'autres choses à penser ?
The safety belt is the problem in this situation
Que gracinha,partiu meu coração
"Is somebody in there? Is somebody in there?..." to stupid racka get yo as in that water and get that damn woman out the car. The boy started the conversation off with his mom had a seizure and crashed in the lake, you get there and see the car damn near submerged entirely and you want to ask her some god. Dayum. Questions... 🤦🏾
Thank you for saving her hope she is ok and that boy is amazing
This is what America is about.. The great white hope saving the colored folk not hurting them. Thank ya jesus.
🙏❤️
❤Ireland ❤
The boy and the officer acted fast simple questioning and action 😊
Bravo ❤
What about white bad cops...nothin?thats what i thought!
Почему😮 до конца не показали
Women drivers am i right 😅
Is he really considered a hero for doing a job he's paid to do??
He moved so slow it pissed me off
The love from a son to their mother is priceless! This is so evident from his frantic call of "help her"
Дякую тим добрим людям за порятунок! Дитинко,тримайся!!!😮😮😮❤
Jua told u she in water keep asking same shit scary ass jump in
❤❤❤❤❤
Tbaik....
80% of his focus was taking the video!!!!
The baby boy desperately trying to save his momma
Them teeth having a seizure too my boy
"Is someone in there"..... are you serious🤦‍♂️ just take your time buddy.... dumb 🐖
Did the idiot cop just ask “ is somebody in there?” 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ no 💩
😔
Ils ont atterri dans la mer noire ?
A real héroe
💔
Jesus! My heart went out for that young man.  Thank God for the police officer who stepped in to help.
ur filming this. shame on u...
I’ve been there baby and I’m so glad you saved your mama just like somebody saved mine.  Praise God!!!
aww bless. I hope they're OK
SU MIRADA DE TERROR DEL HERMOSO NIÑO 👦🏻 ME IMPACTÓ, GRACIAS POR AYUDAR ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a horrible place to park your car
Pauvre petit bout 😢😢. Merci à ces hommes d'avoir sauvé sa maman.😢😢. Ses pleurs m'attriste
😢😢
Oh goodness! 😢
I’m glad they saved her!
🙏🙏
Grown men/cop pmo ngl cause why you asking if there’s someone in there after being told there’s someone in there😑
I don't understand why the men were moving so slowly?
This why we need police. Not all are bad.
The cop was doing his job ,the factiry workers just being good humans ...bravery ???? Heros ? I m confused by this .odern age were everyone is a hero by just doing what humans should be doing ..nobodies life was on the line so were is Bravery awards appropriate...i think the child deserves acilaids and big thanx fir sure  to the officer and the gentlemen that helped ...but the rest of the awarded this and that ..let such things stat orivate between a pwrson saved and those who saved them ..we do nt all need media attention and awards ...just my oppinion ,nobody needs to agree or disagree you can have your own oppinions ...
Yes, well done humans, we do deserve to exist and explore the Universe.
Dear Jesus
A real police officer.
Not taking ANYTHING away from this story - but honestly how/why/who was the camera man here?? Did the little boy find a cop? Bodycam?
Que  desepero  tadinho do menino vendo sia mamaecdentro carro o quecum filhontbem nao faz por sua mae no ❤❤❤❤😢😢é uma
How do you drive into a lake in a road like that?
Real heroes
Человеческая жизнь безценна,спасибо  за помощь❤
Espero que que todos se hallan salvado
Ситуация до слёз
if the child is telling you that his mom is having a seizure....and Frantically telling you....WHY ASK, "Is she in there?" so nonchalantly as if you're afraid to get your shoes wet!!
Blessings to the cop who helped. He was an angel sent from heaven ❤
True but they are taught  evaluate the scene loud n clear his camera on but he was scared too prolly if what was in the water
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
was that- was that a minion in the water floating by
🦋💜🦋
Why is the officer asking rhetorical questions. The child already told him she had a seizure and is in the car.  She couldn't answer to tell him she's in there anyway... he took too long to react.
These are the stories I like to see, and I know this HAPPENS all the time.  People saving People.
There are sooo many people (men/women) in the world (billions); WHY WOULD YOU SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THIS  TROUBLED MAN?? Geez Jennifer, it's ok to be alone.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
That poor kid, so frantic... heartbreaking 😢❤️
Спасай, а не снимай
God bless ❤
A coragem do policial pra entrar na água, parece eu quando minha mae me acorda.  0 vontade.
Proud of this young man !!! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 Hope his mother is ok.
Sweetheart, you saved your mother's life!
Good work ❤❤❤😢
As a momma seeing and hearing the fear in his voice just broke my heart! 😢😢it breaks me when I see children in distress. Brave young man to go and get help all while going through a traumatic event like that. Thank God for the police officer and whomever else helped them ❤
I have epilepsy, and this is exactly why I don’t drive! You can drive once you go 8 months without a seizure. However, for me it’s not worth it. The very last thing I’m going to do is to put innocent people or myself in danger. Not everyone is the same with epilepsy or whatever she was going through. It’s so sad anyone especially a child went through this.
Such a brave young man....Glory to God 🙏
God had nothing to do wirh this  th2 boy and the guys did. God isn't real. Stupid people
👀
Is somebody in here? (×2) wtf??? Like bro the kid obv said that
Thanks YOU JESUS FOR THIS AMAZING AMEN AMEN
❤brave boy
Slowest rescue in history my mum she sank goes to car is anyone in there yes my mum u idiot I already told you that is the car unlocked no I locked it when I got out what you can't break the window with your hand what type of man are you ffs
My God, I pray mom is alright
Bless him❤
No todos los heroes llevan capa👏👏👏
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Meu Deus 😢
Poor baby
I felt his hurt hope there both well
Did stand there and ask is somebody in there 🤣😂🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
My mom has seizures the anxiety, rhe fear ,the feeling of not knowing what is Goin to happen will leave u traumatized for life.. believe me
I am shocked by the amount of negativity in these comments. Im sorry so many of you are hurting, but projecting your misery onto a child in distress and terrified for his mother, is a whole different level of WTF ...  i hope you heal before you lash out at the right one at some point & get taught a lesson you'll never forget.....
I understand having to stay calm as a first responder, however I can’t help but feel like if I were the cop I would have ran faster, reacted quicker, wasted less time. Smh I’m still calm but I’m getting it done I’m saving that babies mama
Omg
Yes thank God and tha officer
WOW God Bless all of them 🙌🏽❤️ He said tell EMS to step it up 🥹 The Son Saved His Mom The People that called EMS ❤️👌🏾💙
WOW God Bless all of them 🙌🏽❤️
Isn't that his job
I was more concerned about recording😮
🙏🏽🙌🏽
❤❤❤
The child rescued her
How in the HELL did bro end up in a lake? Come on mom
Bless this little boy, and his family! Bless this mans kindness!
Omg😢
That Boy Loves his Mama! Heros in my book...
Dumbass cop waisting time asking if someone is in the vehicle while the kid is literally screaming his mother is in there
“Is somebody in there?” as the child desperately pleads over and over again for the officer to save his mother who he already told was in the damn car. Cops are so fucking dumb it’s insane 🙄
😢😢😢
GOD BLESS THE OFFICER ❤
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Whatever hope that woman thank you so much. God bless you and God be with you all the days in your life.😮
Blessed ❤
Good Samaritan rescues woman while cop asks a child incredibly stupid questions.
Dramatic he has every right to be freaked out so don't say dramatic saving k
Our cops, firefighters, EMS, 911 dispatchers, always deserve a BIG applause, BIG👍👍👍 Just like I made my kids in my classroom to memorize: “911 is whom you called when you need the help”❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤we love you guys and always count on you 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Blessings
I'm sorry but "good Samaritan" doesn't apply to an officer getting paid to do their job.   A good Samaritan is a civillian that didn't have to stop, but did, and helped not expecting a reward.   I'm very grateful that she's ok and that the officer and the two good Samaritans helped her tho.
Спасибо вам большое добрые люди что не стали равнодушными
Bless that sweet babys heart!❤
GOD LOVES YOU SON MAY GOD CONTINUE TO PROTECT YALL THANKS OFFICER
That poor little guy so scared for his momma🥺
Man thats scary to have a seizure drive off the road into water Jesus
Bro got all the cámara wet😂😂
Oh my god
My God.
ohhh Thanks !!!
Was she saved?? I don't see that here.
Bless that baby!
Dramatic?
Jesus the officer could react a bit faster.
Deus Santo que agonia!!! 😭😭😭
That baby broke my heart 💔GOD i pray for him and his mother and the people who helped save her ❤ thank you all for being so brave 🙏🏾
Dumbass cop, “is somebody in there” obviously?!!!!
Господи спаси и сохрани малыша и маму!!!!!❤❤❤
So galdthe baby helped his mom...but how's the cop a good Samaritan that's his job...but thank you
They saved her life 🙌
THE KIDS CRYING AND SAYING HIS MOM IS IN THERE ALSO SHES IN WATER HOW THE HELL IS SHE SUPPOSED TOANSWER THAT
No tienen una cadena para jalar al auto ??
Kenapa bisa masuk ke kolam
This broke me down. I hope she survived
This sweet baby saved her mom.❤.  HERO ❤❤
Why is the cop not showing ANY sense of urgency? Ew!
Omygosh, how devastating. I pray they are doing well & safe. 🙏
Oh my God 🙏🙏🙏❣️
Is someone in there this kid screaming my moms in there ??
Poor hellcat
Так долго думал и шёл, да еще снимал....
I am astonished at the bravery BUT it feels wrong making entertainment out of peoples trauma or trajedy
❤️👏Little guy, you just became a hero!👏❤️
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
😢😢
That was a poor rescue from that officer.     Yeah, I will just sit back here and see if anybody comes out the car!   WOW.  Little kid pointing wet at the car talking about his mothers having a seizure and you go to the car hey hello is anybody in there?      Poor kid and mom to have that officer.  👮‍♀️ omg
What luck that you guys filmed it
Dios mío 😢❤
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Meu Deus 😢
Debe llamar al 911 mientras va al lugar y nunca dejar de hacerlo, según las películas Acuden de inmediato😅
Que tristeza
Cop is a moron
This reminds me of the time when I was 4 years old and my dad had a seizure in the middle of traffic and people came to help us. I'll never forget that. This man and the cop are heroes.
"She's under the water!" "Is somebody in there?" "Glyes, gluglutherglis glyou gltupid glfakk"
As a mother with epilepsy who has totaled 2 vehicles having a seizure, my heart sunk for this baby😢 I pray his mama is okay ❤
YAH bless the cop who made the effort to save another.🙏💜🙏
Thank you sir.
You are the best son any mother can have! God bless you always.
Well if this doesn't tear at your heart strings you must be alien
😢😢😢😢😢😊
God bless: Amen 🙏 lord ❤
Police officers lack of urgency is despicable
Nobody but God  🙏🙏🙏🙏
Cant swim
Clean title no valve tick.
Godbless him...n mom
Bless that little boy, and God Bless the American man that saved that little boy's mother, that's who Americans are @.
😭😭😭😭😭
Que bom deu tudo certo 🙏🙏
Thank you Jesus for everything the officer did and her son
i recently lost my mother in an accident right next to me and it’s horrific. pleading and no one came to help. 20 minutes before the ambulance arrived so the was no chance. this officer may not realize the gravity of what he has done for this family
The lady made it and is back home now. Still great people all round!
lol they blurred her face but don’t give a single damn about the child’s privacy. They need to have a little respect.
🙏🙌😭😥🇩🇴💯🥰
😮😮😮 I Mean seriously  , Is Somebody In There ? Do you think that the child would have came to you like that and it wasn't true 🤔
Thank you to the amazing Officer because he saved her life and to be honest her son's. Amazing rescue
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Officers risk THEIR Lives everyday just like this. Where is the celebration after. None. And Real Men don’t want it either. Maybe once! Lol
Good bless you
Thank God,  this little boy got help for his mother... I hope she is okay.  God's BLESSINGS ... 🙏 🤲 🙏 ❤
Yeah bro. Some one is in there
Is someone in there, proceeds to scream she's in there.
"My mom's in the water!!"  "Is she in there? Damn. Water looks cold"
It might be me but why was the officer asking if someone was in the car when the lil boy just said it was 🤦🏾
I be thinking through the worst till I open my eyes and see the real world God bless your moms soul and I pray that shell be fine 🙏🏻
Liam?
You see woman king drive
Omg
How did they end up in the water?
Thank God for  the good Samaritans that stop to help.
All of them are heroes. Even that brave little man.🎉❤❤God takes care of his own.
Thank you so much for helping the child ❤❤❤❤❤
My gosh I pray my son wouldn’t have to see me go through this. This was so heartbreaking to see this boy crying for someone to save his mum 🙏🏻❤️❤️
Oh le pauvre petit jeune tellement affolé, heureusement qu'il a trouvé cet homme très gentil qui est venu très vite merci monsieur pour avoir aidé ce etit garçon, peuchère 😭😰👍👍🤲👏👏👏❤️
Bravery, Hero in help, assistance. God bless him AND rhe victim.
Jesus, pigs man “is she in there?” how stupid do you have to be?
ขอบคุณพี่ชายใจดี
My heart goes out to the young child 😢😮🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
N é por nada n mas esse moleque aí parece o zagueiro do vasco Léo Pelé kkkkkkkkk
That cop sucks!
Kids a trooper good kid.
Graças a Deus
BRUH
Damn I hope she is ok! Brave kid!
That cop has the laziest reaction ever like brah the kid ain’t driving himself
なんで撮影続ける余裕がある？ カメラ（スマホ？）捨てて、両手で助けた方がよくないですか？ １分１秒を争う事態ですよ？！
What a shame nice car now gone 😢
That kid looks terrified. That kid saved his relatives life. Good job kid. Good job. Your a complete stranger and I'm proud of u. And the people who helped u. All of u. Good work. Fantastic I love seeing real people doing real good things that make a difference.
How can you hate another human being,
When Lassy's stuck in the car
세차를 특이하게 하시네.
This is more proof  that cops are stupid  if a care in water  how in the hell are they gone here u the boy is telLing u 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Stop asking if if someone’s in the car that kid is telling you 100 times I am stressed go
Well, then what’s happening now? Is he adopted or is he? Is he OK? Is he in a safe place?😢
of course it had to be a *Charger*
Praying for Her Safety and Wellbeing  Please God Wrap Your Loving Arms Around Her With Your Love and Protection’s From ALL Hurt and Danger’s.    🙏💕🤦‍♀️🙏🤦‍♀️💕🙌🏽🙌🏽🙏❤️‍🩹🙌🏽🙏🤔
Dear God. Thank God they rescued her
Why he asking dumb as questions 🤔
Thank you person for stopping and helping his Mom!!! 😢…
Thank you soo Much! GOD ALWAYS SEND SOME ONE ❤
Please tell me they saved her😢❤
YEAH, LETS NOT DEFUND OUR AWESOME POLICE‼️‼️‼️‼️💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Cra,y
😢😢😢😢
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Him asking that dumb ask questions thinking the victim is going to say something under the water and didn’t have pep until someone else was at the car . That was annoying.
Omg...the anxiety and hurt i felt for that baby and his mother...i need more reaction...but im glad theyre ok
Omg this poor child was so frantic and terrified thank God she found someone to rescue her
Is there an update? Praying for this family. What a brave boy.
Moving real slow buddy. Kid literaly says shes in there. And he goes "is someone in there?" Nahhhhh.
The cop was way too calm there. No sense of urgency from him.
That cop was moving too slow for me! “Is somebody in there”. He just told you his mama is in there. OMG🤦🏾‍♀️
That isn’t a boy that’s a MAN. This is why the gender war is BULLSHIT. All I see is unconditional love, loyalty, & honor. Props Bro, you’re a Hero.
God Bless 🙏 you all abundantly 🙌
Fun fact  It’s harder to break glass under water
“Is somebody in there?” No, the 11 year old kid was driving…
God bless those who helped her ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Смотря на этого ребенка , вспоминайте убитых евреями детей Газы и Палестины
…he took his sweetest time..
When she woke up she probably called the officer racist
The kid told him 100 times it was his mom. Where’s the urgency!?
Eles sobreviveram
July 24th is not here yet. Hope the mom is okay.. seizure
the heroes that we need...
May G-d bless  him and keep him...
That's why manual window opener is better.... When in that situation.... Electrical sht goes down... You cant open the window 😢😢😢😢
🤲🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻♥️☝️yaarabb aftha
Brave child! ❤Thankyou to the courageous samaritans turning into  rescuers
How desperate and incredibly brave this young boy is. I hope mom made it 😢
The little boy... omg!!  I Felt that... You did good little man.♡♡♡♡♡
I think her son did what any normal child would do given the circumstances. Why does he have be brave to ask strangers for help in an unexpected crisis like this? Is there something not being said? Are the strangers from another planet? We’ve seen animal portrayals do the same in a crisis, asking humans for aid, well not asking, that’s brave. No this wonderful young man should have every expectation of aid.
I didn't know police officers saved lives. I've only been told how blood thirsty and murderous they are.
🗣️All them dumb questions just help them they already said there moms in there 🤦‼️💯
I pray she will be OK please God
cop so slow, “is someone in there?” boys coming to you crying, get a clue, wtf, should be ready to give all you can in a moment
So brave young man, you did awesome saving your mom ❤❤❤
What a useless cop Jesus christ
Thank You officer. And good boy. 🙏🏼❤️
save from the belly of the beast
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
😮😮😮
God bless them all.
Bravo agent
❤❤
K pena mi niño Dios lo bendiga
God bless you great Son 💗. Thank you good Samaritan, stay ever blessed
Poor kid he is one brave man he cries for help has his momma is in the water😢
Ugh I just want to hug him. Poor kid!!! 😢
THANK! GOD 🙏🏽 AMEN 🙏🏽🙏🏽
Both Hero's ❤❤❤
That poor kid vreak my heart hope his momma its ok
Wow hope she's OK and God bless that kid and my respect for the good Samaritan and police officer. Bravo...
Cop: "is the water cold" I'll wait on shore until she absolutely needs me.  Bystander: "Stand back pig"
Please Give these Officers and the others their flowers as well.
The little boy keeps saying my mom is in there she sunk she in the water the cop decided to ask again "is someone in there"🙄
I salute you as good humans and OFFICERS...... NOT ALL ARE BAD. THANK YOU
It’s a bad idea to drive when you have a history of seizures. Real bad idea.
That cop didktnhave any sense of urgency
If she no's that can happen she should not be driving. Thank God for her son
That cop didn't  care foreal
El policia espero que el niño entre primero y despues lo iso el para ayudarlo al comienzo dudo pero la saco
Does anyone have news about this mother and son? 🙏🇧🇷
😮❤
The questions the man asked when he saw a car were just ridiculous and then instead of rushing to the car he took a few much too long seconds to go and check - holding the phone in his hand- of course video first 😔🙅🤦🏾‍♂️🤦it got me annoyed
The cop is stupid as hell SMH the kid did more than him
يا. رب. أنقذ. امه. و. آحميها. يا. ارحم. الراحمين. و بارك. في. هذا. الطفل. 😢😢😢😢😢
Poor baby
Tan lindo el niño hermoso ❤❤❤
I can’t believe he just stood and asked where she was. Where else would she possibly be in an upside down car. What a simple man.
Allahu Akbar,  how beautiful her son is, may he always protehis mumma like this
God bless everyone
😮😢
ну и времена! с камерой полез спасать! макает ее и макает. ради контента? я даже представить себе не могу, чтобы в такой трагический момент схватиться за камеру p.s: нашла ответ, полистав коменты я смотрела невнимательно и не поняла, что это полицейский
Salute young man and Good Samaritan 🫡
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
There are 3 very heroic men in this video. God bless them all.
How he get out of the car but she didn't?
What a brave (Hero) that little boy and  the man that jumped in to help. God I pray they are all fine .😢❤❤❤❤❤
As a paramedic of 25 years. I will say the hardest part of my job was dealing with children and/or parents of the people having an emergency. The people having an emergency. We deal with in our own way the kids and parents are different
Caso me dió pánico.👏👏👏🙏
He's like no time to waste help her good looking out
The fact he got out the water safe and could get help is the bravest thing
He sure took his dear sweet time 🫤
Gosh that really hurts your heart doesnt it?
❤❤❤❤
Oh baby…
Man that's scary I have epilepsy and used to only have a few a year in my sleep until one day I had one driving right after I dropped my daughter off at dance and I drove through someone's garage and into their kitchen! I was so lucky and I do not drive anymore. I thank God everyday my daughter was not in the car with me.
Reminds me of another incident where a little boy had called the cops to save his mom and they shot him
N''imitez pas cette scène s'il vous plaît jugez en vous même
Youtude AI SHOW MORE GOODNESS AND KINDNESS
Wow 😮😮😮 I hope and pray everyone was okay 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Bella USA Florida ❤️
Im trying to hold these tears back.
Lord thank You for having mercy and being there with this child and mother. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
So tragic, but I love to see people come together in such a crazy world these day. God bless
That cop was too nonchalant about it
Poor boy sad
God bless that gentleman and bless her son, hope he never has to experience that kind of anxiety again.
How would the cop hear the mom calling out? Calling for her wasted time. Luckily she’s safe
Black pope you are a 🤡.  You still have not addressed my statement. Iam not emotional  If the lady drown it would not effect me. The only good  professional conduct was shown by the police. They are still not Hero's
❤
Suffering a medical emergency while driving has got to be one of the scariest things.
God is good all the time
Omg that poor child but thank god he was ok so he was able to run and get help. I’m sure he has some PTSD after this I know I would so scary
Was she saved? Poor lad, it must have been terrifying
She's in the water but he asking if someone in there ......wtf you don't understand English
God Bless our caring and special people ❤❤❤
Gracias por ayudarlos
Thank God for the police and the child to save that woman  Amen praise God ❤❤❤❤
Thank you Jesus for saving this woman. I pray she will make a full recovery. In Jesus name, Amen 💜🙏💜
To God Almighty be all the Glory for this great deliverance. God bless this boy and the cops for the quick response.
Deus salve a família 😢
My god  !
Que pendejos!! Como preguntan is some body there? 🤪 si las personas no pueden  Hablar, que brutos ponganle cero
Q horror y terror Dios permita estén bien todos
I said this on another platform! But the little boy reminded me of the kid that was at the door of a womans house begging her to hurry up. He’s like ma’am hurry your son hurry! Come on momma .  Broke my heart to see another kid having to go thru something like this. Thankfully in this video the son was able to get help! The don man and cop are amazing for getting to the mother and getting her out.
Took his sweet time at first
Why cops very cold
Why cops very cold
Honestly…. This cop hesitated.  Questioning if someone was in there when the kid clearly said there was.  Walked up to the vehicle.  Gotta move quicker
Poor Baby❤
Gracias a Dios y a todos los que intervinieron para hacer del rescate un éxito. Dios los bendiga abundantemente.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Que desesperación 😢
Deus recompense estes heróis
What a brave young man. He saved his Moma. God bless him and his Moma.❤
😢😢😢😢
❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you for you all bravery 😊
"Is somebody in there?!" .....oh noo🤦🏻‍♀️
brave children
How the boy was able to get all of that out amazes me... he spoke it so clear and as calm as he could.... wow. I hope she is ok now...
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😮😢💙💖❤️
This child is an angel to his mom. He frantically got her help, thus saving her life. Kudos to him. Thank you officers for rescuing her. I pray you get promoted two levels up - to lieutenants🤗❤️❤️❤️
И телефоны в упаковке нашлись, вот уроды
The poor baby😢 his desperation to save his mamam
He was not moving with enough urgency at first
He loves his mother so aware and brave
Lord, Jesus!
Ts would hurt me 😢😢
Pobre niño ni podía hablar de lo espantado qué estaba.
I mean the cop was moving slow asl.
Poor kid looks like I did, the moment I heard the Mcrib had been discontinued!
It looks like they took there time bru and the kids told u before u got there what happened like bro yes there is someone in there and he said she haveing a seizure just walk she good bro she not in the car probably under water
Anybody else mad about his piss poor response time. He literally gave the kid a ride. Knew that the mom was in the car and it comes to him. Way far back while the kid is already up to the vehicle.
Life savior 💪
Great job little man.......and to the good samaritan who saved his Mom. Hope she's okay and will be fine.
Chills watching this. Bless that family and those wonderful first responders. I hope everything turned out ok.
Terrifying
What a wonderful son
DEUS DERRA  ME BENCAOS SOBRE ESTE HOMEM QUE AJUDOU A CRIANÇA A TIRAR A MAE DA AGUA GRATIDAO SENHOR LOUVADO  SEJA O SENHOR AMEM
The questions are annoying sir just help
O perigo só de entra no lago rapaz…
Not sure why you made him tell you over and over that his mother was in there but I'm very thankful she was rescued. What a brave young man!! You saved your mother's life, little one. You're a hero
What a brace boy! ❤
God bless you so much cops for saving her ❤️❤️❤️
Thanks be to God ❤
😢
Really sad hope they be okay😮damn 🙏
Oh thank you God for putting the right ppl in the right place at the right time. WmAs a person with epilepsy, I can not imagine what this boy was going through. Several times my kids have had to call 911 for me but nothing close to this. My goodness I'm almost at a loss for words just because, wow anyway. Praying for all involved.
Q polícial bosta,porq não pulou na água pra tentar salvar 😡
Siempre  dios  pone  su  mano  para hayudar
🙏🏻🤍
People advocate DEFUNDING the POLICE. But whose the first person's they call in an emergency. I have no issues with the police and job they do. Granted there are bad apples, as we've seen all to frequently. Applaud this officer for his response and bravery.
PLEASE TELL ME SHE OK
😢
Dios le de fuerza por la  perdidadesu familia amen gloria a dios  amen
I hate seing kids in distressed. 😢
you are super Man ❤❤❤❤❤
I WONDER HOW THE SON GOT OUT I THINK IT'S HARD TO OPEN A DOOR UNDER WATER LIKE THAT, AND THE WINDOW MUST HAVE BEEN UP SMHH 😮WHAT A BRAVE LITTLE BOY TRYING TO GET HELP TO SAVE HIS MOTHER THANK YOU JESUS ❤
Grande filho e grandes homens parabéns a todos, Deus é bom
WHEN I WAS WATCHING THIS I WAS HOLDING MY PHONE SO TIGHT LIKE TO SEE IF SHE HAD MADE IT OUT ❤THE SON WAS INCREDIBLE, GOD WAS WATCHING OVER THEM 😢😢THANK THE MAN WHO JUMPED IN TO SAVE HER ,THANK YOU JESUS ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That boy definitely saved his mama's life
Pobresitos Ojalá y todos estén bien 🙏🙏😮
Omg 😭😭😭😭
💔🥺
😢
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Is somebody in there?" Complete dumbass. Yes. There's someone in the car.
Nah that ‘is somebody in there’ still pissing me tf off
😢😢😢
My heart just broke for that child 😢
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🖤
Is she ok?????
A grown man who is a trained cop is asked by a little boy to save his mom. He gets to the scene and another child is trying to save the mom.   His first question is "Is somebody in there??" What a stupid ass, ragged ass, dumb ass excuse for law enforcement. And they think theyre better than us 😂😂
The boy said his mom was in the car in the beginning. When finally at the car, looking at it and asking repetitive questions won't help, but taking action will. Those few seconds could be the difference between life and death.
Unfortunately more than hundred thousand people in Gaza lost their lives because of the genocide. No Samaritan could help them out
❤ thank you for the love of us all Amen 🙏😌🙏😌😮
❤
I can’t even imagine my son getting out the car & looking for help & who knows how far he walked/ran😢
Gracias  a Dios este buen hombre  estaba en ese lugar para salvar a esta persona que su hijo con tanta desesperación gritaba Dios te bendiga  señor por sacar y salvar a esta persona 🙏
That poor child😢😢😢😢.  There's nothing worse than to hear and see the fear of losing a parent on a child's face.❤❤❤😢😢😢
Quienes salvaron la vida de esa mujer donde quiera que estén el universo les provea de grandes bendiciones y victorias en esta vida y la otra
Cops really aren’t the brightest… is somebody in there 3x really?!
😢😢😢😢😢
Some things make you realize that there’s very little hope left in this world but there is still hope.
هل الام بخير 😢😢😢
GRACIAS DIOS POR PONER A LAS PERSONAS  EN EL JUSTO MOMENTO GRACIAS POR SALVARLOS BENDICIONES 🙏🏻💖🌷
Respect to both officers god bless
GRACIAS POR  SALVARLOS 😢🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💖💖🇲🇽
Poor little boy❤
Why are you taking the time to yell "is someone in there?" The kid told you there was, and that they were incapacitated.
Bless that baby!! Now, if momma has seizures, why is she driving?
Thank God for the man who took the time to help the child's mom
yes let’s ask the child that just traumatically explained his mother had a seizure and is sinking currently “is anyone in there” AND then take your time to get to his mother smh what a cop.
I don't like how slow the officer was
Trhats one of my bigest fears. I pray me or none of my family member ever have to go throuvh this. Its a horrific way to go. God bless that boy and those rescuers
Bless that baby I hope everyone is ok and thriving
❤❤❤❤❤
Is mom alive what happened is everyone ok the cops his urgency was delayed dramatically in my humbled opinion.
Bro what is wrong with this cop zero ability to but 2 and 2 together.... let's see 1 little boy crying and says my mom is having a Seizure and due crashed in the water they walk up to her there's obviously a car illegally parked in the pond 😂 and then the little boy runs is in the water when the cop is asking is there someone in there ... like it wasn't obvious a d then someone else had to get involved before the cop was like dang now I actually have to do something
The cop laziness pissed me off
Poor little boy ❤❤
Que deus abençoe as maos desses homens
Quit asking dumb questions  and go fo it
Police: is somebody in there?! No answer... ok bye!!😂
What a brave little boy!  Was she saved?!!
And some social media influencer called we don't need man
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🤲🤲🤲🤲
Is his mom okay 😢
He just told you she was in there.  Now get the hell in there.
Cop took his sweet ass time
🙏🙏🙏
🙏🙏🙏🙏
God Bless that baby boy. Getting help for his Mom. Praying the Mom is ok. 🙏🏻❤️

😢
Ngxesi ❤, 🇿🇦
That cop sounded annoyed at the inconvenience and moved with absolutely no urgency.
The man shouting “ Is someone inthere!?” Like she is going to answer!! The young man JUST told him she was having a seizure
Oh the racsim 😂😂😂
OMG Lord I hope and pray she's OK thank God for her son getting the attention of the police and thank God for this officer getting her out😢😢😢
Разбить стекло камнем нельзя, ручка двери в воде не легко открыть
That little boy is so brave❤
Please did she make it🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
*half the car submerged in water*  Is somebody in there?  ….    Ah, yes. Kind sir would you mind helping me escape before I die from inhaling water into my lungs?
How awful I pray that the Mother will be fully restored back to her normal health! Thank you for your service and for helping that poor woman and child!😮
Police rush over to car and see if there is a person in car by standing and asking and no action from you at first seems so sad.😢😢
Really the boy is real hero who saved his mother's life by called to the young man with panic but bravery. Big salute to the young man who was finally succeed to rescue the boys mother from the drowning car. God bless you. ❤❤❤👍👍👍🌹🌹🌹🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
So sad heart wrenching little boy screams, poor baby. I hope his mom was resuscitated.
🙏
Instant tears he is so strong 😢
😢😢😢😢😢
A good white man.
Glória aDeus pela vida desse homem que ajudou etantos como ele  que tem em todos os países  Deus vos abençoe grandemente em nome do senhor Jesus Cristo amém
This is so beautiful tis child  saved her life an thank you to the man thst helped God bless  all
Misericórdia que angústia 😢😢
Like how they call him good Samaritan for doing his job
😱😱😱
Chorei
I don't see her being dramatic , I see that she's crying cause her mom caught a seizure while they both was under the water she escaped and found help , nothing dramatic about how she acted just scared for her mom's ❤❤❤❤
The rescuer so calm and collected 🙌
Jesus Hallelujah
Hope they managed to save her😭🥰
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amen
Solamente es un angel que mando el Todopoderoso 😢😢😮😮😊😊😊
Место того чтобы снять на видео,да помоги двумя руками собака драная
she had a siesure
英雄❤
Did she make it?
Is she ok now ?
Bravo but the only thing I have to criticize is you should’ve just went in there of course somebody is in there that kid wouldn’t be screaming
I thought it was clear the kid says his mom is in there...why as again 2 times if someone was in there and then be told by the kids again to help her? Wtf
Hay que ir más despacio,así pasan las cosas
He yells to tell EMS to step it up. Yet, he moves slower than molasses on a cold winter morning. Anybody familiar with Orange, TX already knows why he's moving so slowly.
I feel so bad that this child had to experience this horrifying situation! I hope they are all doing well now.  Thank you to the rescuers for helping them out.
Wow... well done
Did the mom survived ?
hat off to ya sir, hat off in respect
"Is she in there?"  No shit sherlock!
Holy Lord, this stuff breaks my heart, but God always sends his angels.
Donde fue eso? Que paso, con las personas?
The men that saved her are great heros❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oooooh his voice is so terrified. Thank God for the rescue 🙏🙏
Cop didn’t even try to hurry. It didn’t matter to him at all.
Meu Deus 😢😢😢😢,🙏🙌
The sweet baby boy just saved his mama’s life! The sound of terror coming from his voice and his body language completely broke me! To hear him in the background, begging for her life ! Ugh my heart! God bless this little hero❤❤❤❤❤❤
The news should give an update on this incident . That poor boy I just wanted to reach out and hold him close. I hope all is ok with his mom GB them and the cop and man that helped save her life as well. 😢❤🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank you to the good samaritan who saved his mom… there are still some good people out there, God bless you sir and again thank you for doing what many probably wouldn’t do
Did they save her!!!?
😢
Got me crying hard
Praise God. ❤
What a brave young man, and thanks for showing not all police are racist and cruel
Thank God and bless this boy in Jesus name ❤
Cop taking his good ol time

Thankfully he got some quickly to help him. He’s his Mom’s hero. Thanks to the policeman & the EMS.

Poor little guy knowing that your Momma is drowning and you're helpless like that, poor dude!!!! Thank GOD for that amazing police officer who helped save her life!!!!  💗🙏💜GOD BLESS💜🙏💗
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

What happened to mom
God Bless the Woman, Son, and the Officer.
Omg is she ok???
God bless the young man and his mother
Малой молодец, во время успел❤ и боагодарю спасателям, которые успели во время спасти маму🙏 Спасибо Богу🙏❤️
Deus e soberano, ele da força e coragem em meio as provações e envia socorro no momento certo.
❤❤❤ ese hombre es un gran hombre y Dios lo bendice por eso enormemente dice proverbios 19:17 por cuanto bien le hagas a un necesitado mi deuda es contigo o sea Dios está en deuda con él y cuando él lo necesite en el momento que lo necesite tenga por seguro que Dios lo ayudara amén
What a dumb ass cop
Senhor! Que desespero dessa criança! Espero que a mãe esteja bem...😢
❤😢aah vraiment DIEU SOIT LOUER❤!.
That poor baby😢
I don't know If yall got gators in Texas but if that was Florida and it was me she'd be outta luck
Poor child😢
The older brother that the little boy got to help him was indeed a hero as well.
Deus abençoe 🙌 esses anjos cuidadores ❤
Well we can tell that cop doesn't listen he told you she was in there
Thank you LORD😮😮😮
There literally isn’t no reason to call the damn cops now a days… You get more help from by standers!!!
💔
🤳🏻 camera man was too lazy and slow....
The little boy is saying help my mom is in the car she's having a seizure us is anybody in their hell yeah his mother slowpoke
Why he just didn't jump in the water and look for the child's mother to save her from drowning? Some people or should I say them people!!!
Camera 🤳🏻 man busy in doing camera....      Just leave it and help him....      Is it compulsory for u to,do camera....
Oh my😢
Really-_- is there somebody in there?
There are many services that will drive you around if you have seizures. If you can afford a charger, you can afford medicare.
Praying they're ok 🙏
Glória a Deus pelo resgate Deus abençoe a todos envolvidos
Ge moves so fkn slow
bless them..that is what police work look like..good son ..good cops..gud work hope momma made it
What the hell! was he even listening to the child with any concern, the child told you in detail that his Mom was in the car. It’s so hard not to be angry with this man. I pray everyone is okay.
Tadinho 😢o desespero pele mal consegue falar😢
Thankfully there was a good Samaritan there and not a police officer asking the little boy for his I.D. Smh
Meu Deus ajude eles
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
these are police officers❤
bendiciones
No Abre la puerta 🚪 Porque Es Eléctrico 🤦🏼🤷🏼😡👎🏼
The Cops is not a good Samaritan. It is his job to help civilians in danger.
Give that kid and the cops that helped their own holiday. I have seizures, its debilitating. I had one so bad I fell backwards and hit my head on a dining room chair, the the metal front door and the floor. I had a severe concussion and wasn't able to wake up for a few days in the hospital. If you see someone having a seizure try to help them to the ground safely and gently hold their limbs to help make sure they don't hit anything to further injure themselves anymore and call 911.
Omg that poor baby boy😢😢😢
Omg I dont know what I'd do in that situation scary😢
I pray that this woman is OK and thank you to her son for helping her out and getting the help that she needed❤
Poor kid. What is someone with epilepsy doing driving a car? With a kid in it?
Маму спасли или опоздали?
The absolute DUMBEST thing he could say is, is anybody in there!? 😖😳😡
I was just in an argument with someone about answering a phone call. They keep their phone on silent and don’t give a shit if someone has an emergency. “I don’t know first aid! I can’t save anyone’s life!” People have no idea how much of a difference you can make by just BEING there! And I’ll bet you my life savings you wouldn’t just stand there and let somebody die without trying to save their life.
Thank you sir for saving this childs mother.  Gods continuous blessings you.
Why is everyone moving more urgently than the cop whose job it is to actually help??? Bro crying for help and he’s taking his time walking to the car asking if someone’s in there like bro didnt say from the BEGINNING his mom is in there having a seizure…
Somebody please tell me the woman lived
The child was in that water only care for his mother to make it out alive..  that is a heroic act..   Yet the clown in the uniform was not going to get in that water right away he was worried about office safety first.. while the child is pleading for his mother..
And his body cam still worked underwater!❤
Тупой сор
❤❤god bless this boy he saved his mom life ,god bless her and god bless everyone that helped rescue the lady .i hope the lady made a full recovery 🙏 ❤
Poor baby...❤❤❤hugs sweetpea hugs.
Sweet boy bless his heart
Espero que esteja bem
Young man was very brave
I'm at work and I had to hide my face 😢
Все хорошо с женщиной ??
@bhumphries1360 thank you!!!!
Is somebody in there?       ..  buuhplblup blup bllhhhlllupp bhhhlluuoop
This is why you shouldn't drive when you have seizures. I'm glad everybody is OK.
I so poor for them 😢😢😢 God bless them please 🙏🙏🙏
My God that baby I hope his mom is okay and him
Waheguru Ji ❤
🌽🌽🍅🍉🍞
🐧🐧🦋
My worst nightmare n that kid stayed together n got help. What a hero!
Lilla rote gelppe  Orancje Bencinjennne
I pray the mom is ok!  This young man is a hero.  Bless him Lord!
Que angústia essa criança está sentindo que desespero Ainda bem que apareceu alguém pra ajudar tomara que tudo dê certoassim eu espero
Ainda bem que não era tão fundo meu Deus que desespero dessa criança 😢Deus deu um livramento pra eles 🙌
Saudia Arabia was the safest place in the world up untill new laws allowing women drive and that is a fact no joke.
He ( boy) said she’s in there  having a seizure .. cop is anyone in there?  Umm sir she not going to answer stop with questions  sir … bc she’s having a seizure  she can’t answer you …just run  in that water and do ya best thank you sir  she’s out lol
Wow! What a smart young man to seek help to save his Mom’s life and the officer who saved her life exemplifies what being an officer really means ❤
I saved my twin  sister's life from drowning in a pond when she was young and when she grew up she killed my father after multiple attempts and multiple people besides him, so don't always think that it's a good idea to save someone. You don't know how many people lives will be saved if this person dies
😢oh my god ❤❤
Cop: is somebody in there   Woman: bubbles bubbles bubbles   I dont understand how the cop can ask ''is there somebody in there'' when he can clearly see the car is almost under water.
Why does the lack of urgency frustrate meeeeee like don’t panic but move quicker seconds matter when saving lives
Here me out, every car should have emergency floaties
Great heart. Great JOB congratulations 👌
🧍‍♂️ is somebody in there?
I cant belive he waisted time by asking if someones in there... ive never seen a cop acting this fasy tl a drowning before. Reallh tsking his time.
😭 wow!
Thank JESUS for that MOTHERS CHILD BEING WITH HER
😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks to all the wonderful angels  god hade in  ( place that day ) amen
Se fosse meu marido,  o garoto nem terminaria de falar e ele já estaria salvando quem estivesse no carro 😢
I have passed out an hade seizure i pray i be ok an her lord amen
🙏🙏🙏
No se ve sacar a nadie sino se la oye,..la puertas bloqueadas..es jodudo. Hay que forzar las puertas..para Abrir algo que hags palanca
Weona no sabe ni conducir
These cops are way too casual about this
Uff 👍💪🇵🇱dał radę brawo
This cop took his time pos!
Graças a Deus que Deus colocou esses anjos no caminho gratidão
Almost just cried
Leider verbringen die menschen zu viel damit gefährliche situationen zu filmen,anstadt direkt was zu unternehmen.sekunden retten leben
Ich hoffe dieser junge bekommt seine mama so gesund zurück, wie sie sekunden vor den unfall war und hoffentlich ist🙏🫶
Thanks for saving her, but have you ever heard of HUSTLING, QUIT ASKING DUMB QUESTIONS AND GO? Humans can only go so long without air
❤❤❤ 👍
❤❤😢❤❤
KUDOS TO THIS YOUNG HER0
Is somebody in there   No officer no. I just came to say hello
All them cops we love to hate out here saving us....
Why (the kid knows she has seizures) was she driving! It happens enough he knew what was wrong. That’s a condition you are not to operate machinery with.
Is someone in there? No bozzo.. they're just fishing 🤨
😮😢😢 meu deus tomara q consigam salvar a pessoa
Not one hustle bone in this cop until after getting half ways in the water not reacting to a car being on the water lol
😢como salio el rescate
Hay Dios mío como llego este carro ai acomo iría esta mujer de manejando tan rápido se me parte el corazón de ver al niño
Jesus Christ 🙏🙏
😢 thanks for helped her ❤
Wow, that poor child, smart enough to know not to go near the car. Finding help for his mom. He deserves a 🏅
What an intelligent young man!❤ Even tho his voice was panicked, his will was strong. Great job, young man. You are a hero! ❤
This is really heartwarming. I hope mumma is alright.
Omg holy fuck
The reaction time from the cop was just incompetence 😔
Is that a snake
God my heart just broke for him. I pray they're ok. 🙏🏽❤️
God thank you for this child’s strength and courage
I’m happy the rescued her, but what was frustrating was he said his mom is in the car, and still gets questioned is someone is in the car. If no one was in the car why would he be pleading for help.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Praise God! Thank you Lord and bless you officer.
AMEN AMEN AMEN
OMG! He didn't miss a beat!  Even though he was in distress, it did not stop him from getting the message across and getting his mother some help. God bless him. And the officer who helped us where I started to cry I hate to do this but I'm so overwhelmed with the sweetness of this little angel and thank God she survived. I couldn't even think about punctuation at the time like this
Está criança  e tão forte por favor ajude a
Si existes los ángeles terrenales el señor bendiga grandemente al niño y a los caballeros que rescataron a la mamá ❤❤❤❤
Wait no cause this is crazy. I had a dream last night that I accidentally drove into a river.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Duh, he clearly says "she sunk...she is in the water!" What else do you need? Oh and by the way, did she survive?!!?!! Ending please!!
😢😮 we have to teach our children how to advocate for themselves and how to rise at the situation thank you Jesus that could have been the last time he seen her
Does anyone know the outcome of this accident?
Yes lord Devine grace
The officer couldn't move any SLOWER!!
❤ He's A Angel that son.
That cop was moving slow af
Why are you taking a video just go and help
The cop was taking his time the little boy was in the water before the cop Why are you wearing about if someone is in the car the boy told you
God Never Stops Working, Even When We Are Asleep, God Never Stops Working 🙌🏾
❤❤❤
Good hero this video made me cry for a hour😢
Why ask the police if someone was there 😮
🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉gran niño 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤ grandes erues 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
Bless his little heart ❤️
“Someone in there” bruh go frickin check homie ballin for his moms over here
O bless the Lord😢
Cop asked if the car is unlocked? WTF
Why wasn't he running to save her? Oh, I see, it's another bystander.. because he dam sho wasn't in a hurry..
🙏🙏
Look at all that racism
🙏
Omg I hope this never happens to me I pray to God every day thank God for that person
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🙏
That cop did not really care… glad there was other ppl there to help. That littke boy was begging for help and no urgency from that cop.
Waw tout un enfant ❤❤❤
Of course shes in there ...he just told you ?! ...fuck man ??  This is urgent with secondes counting pffff
The asmr is amazing
Primero dios los saquen a todos con vida sanos y salvos 😢
Please tell me everyone was alright
The kid just told you she's in there .wow
This poor baby was very clear of what the situation was .. The cop  is anyone in there ? “Is the door unlocked !?”  🤨
Well that cop could have taken a lil longer smh if u don’t like your job don’t be a cop
THIS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT!!
Ужасная у вас полиция, не удивлюсь если копы потом застрелили их обоих
Legend has it the cop is still finishing those donuts trying not to go in the water.
Is she in there,is anybody in there?okay just wondering. Like bro! If i saw a vehicle like this am jumping in ASAP
Pobre niño y valiente al buscar ayuda
Kudos to the Good Samaritan. Yeah, the cops are underpaid..🤨🙂
Slow ass cop act faster tf the child gotta lie for
Thank God the lil boy was able to get help. Thank God the Right person came by at the Right time and helped save the mom ❤ Look at God work!!!
،I was wodring , why they not calling 911
Ok but was she saved?
Cop sounded like he didn't wanna get wet
@bhumphries1360 Thank you for your consideration with the update.
The kid ran up to the cop saying "shes in there" and this cop wasted time ASKING "is she in there"😢
Thanks to all involved, especially that brave boy!
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😢 omg
Just more cheap shit click-bait wit no context.  UNSUBSCRIBE
Thank God there are good people in this world 🙏 Thank you heavenly father 🙏🙏🙏
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank God for people with a good heart.
Thank the lord 🙏  Don't drive anymore mama so you guys can be safe
That cop needs to step it up. Hope shes ok
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Those who are bagging on the cop need to stop.  He took the boy right away didnt question him then he went right into the water
NBC will find a way to make this about brutality.
😂 whats a hero today:  Child in desperation:  Cop: hmmm well good job i filled up on coffee that water sure looks chilly, hello maaam? Are you drowning?   Child: 😱😭😭😭 help her! My my mum!  Officer: hello is anyone in there? (As he asks the potentially drowning women)   People today have zero go and no speed 😂
Is somebody in there😡 guy is just wasting some time!
Hfjsoa😂😂
Deus e maravilhoso o garoto teve gas pra redpirar e conseguir sair do carro e pedir ajuda pra retirar sua mae e maravilhos ver que pessoas socorreram ele nesse momento desesperador😢❤
Praise GOD
Good job officer god bless you
That is so scary 😢, You can tell he walked a ways, the guy told him to get in his car to get to where his Mom was, bless his little heart. Why is the cop screaming is someone in there, like theyre going to answer under the water in a car with closed windows, and The Boy told him terrified that his Mom was in the car, Common Sense would tell you, Yes She is in there
😰😰😰👍👍👍
What a lazy police officer!!!
Thank you Jesus 🙏🙏
That cop moved soooo slow
Many many thanks to the hero's. God bless you all.😮  hope all are OK 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Lamentável mas todos sabem que uma represa de telefone ou telecamera deixa mais lento o salvatajo, se vc pode salvar 3 pessoas abaixa a percentual de conseguir salvar só 1😢
What a brave little boy! 😢😢
✨ 🙏 ✨ 💞
Poor Sweet baby. 😢
Poor child... I hope and pray his momma is doing ok 😔🙏
Muy lentos para actuar
The kid just told the police she’s in there why is he still asking if someone’s in there 😡😡
Glórias a Deus que teve misericórdia dessa criança e ouviu o seu clamor ❤
Man im crying thank goodness ❤❤❤❤
how the fuvck did they end up in there
Is h asking the child if she is in there is crazy
Is somebody in there? Our buddy I’m pretty sure he told you that from the beginning his mother is in there drowning😂
Thank you Jesus
የኔማር መልካሙን ወሬ ስማ ስለ እናትህ❤
How about you get yo ass in there and find out if she's in the car? lol like, who were you asking? The kid told you his moms in the water, lol. Finally, a bit of urgency at the end, 🤣
“Help there’s someone in there” “Is anyone in there 👁️👄👁️”
This is sad!! If she has seizures or having a seizure 😢why is she 🚗  a car. This is scary and unsafe. My 🙏 for this lady. I 🙏 she's ok. She shouldn't be operating a vehicle
This is a brave young man up under stress. He still can keep his composure, even though he’s crying, but he’s letting him know. My mom is in danger get her help her God bless his soul and his mom and who saved her.
Дааа,полицейские тоже тормозят, как обычные люди. Наверное ,он испугался.  У меня тоже был случай. Возвращалась домой вечером с работы. Было не поздно, но людей как назло не было. Из-за угла дома, сзади выскочил мужчина, и быстро направился за мной. Я пыталась убежать, кричала, звала на помощь. Он схватил меня за руку и резко повернул к себе. Я занималась подростком рукопашным боем. Когда увидела, что у него нож, страх исчез. Или он или я. Повезло, что это был наркоман. Он был невменяем. Я выбила нож и сломала ему руку. Он упал. Я отбросила нож подальше, пнула его посильнее и бежать. Когда добралась до участка полиции, рядом совсем был. Вид у меня был конечно жесть. На фразу на меня напал наркоман с ножом! Был вопрос:в каких отношениях вы с ним состояли? Браво!
Slow poke
Partir o vídeo atrás é o que se faz
Take your time no worries. That kids crys didn't send you leaping in that water?? 😮
❤
And The OFFICER AS WELL GOD BLESS
Watching this makes me think of the schoolshooting when cops not only did nothing but prevented help.  What is up with this officer.  Camera cut from there just being him and the kid to there being another man actually helping.   This is frustrating.
POOR BABY
She is save now?
It looks so bad, it seems like he picks up a dog first and the mother is nowhere to be seen.
😢😢
Outstanding work by the boy, the bystander, and the cop. 😮
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Jesus for the quick thinking and quick actions taken to save this woman’s life!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 God Bless Them All
His is he dramatic that’s his momma
Gracias mi señor Jesús por mandar a un ángel 😇🙏
Police officer too slow
😢 Querido!
Was she chasing after them Duke Boy's again?
Poor Lil boy, so frightened.. But got his point across well , proud of him ❤
Cop real didn’t want to help 😢
They moving to slow for me
Little man got a whole Big Heart❤
💚🎈🥀💘🌻❣️💐🌼🌺🌸💜🌷❤️🧡♥️💕❇️🏵️💛💮🎍🤍💖💗💓🏆
Is somebody in there what a dumb
The Police he was slow respon 😮
So what was the outcome
VOILA LA POLICE A AUSSI DE BON AGENTS
🫡
She’s having a seizure she’s in the car in the water   “Is she knows there?”  No dingleberry the kid made it up
Oooh my heart ❤️ that boys cry’s for help are both ok now
God Bless them
"Anybody here??".. You are an idiot!..
Cop didn't move with much speed at all
The cop yelling “is there someone in there?” Is complete idiocy.
Blacks hate me coz of my disability and sexuality.
El niño y los hombres que ayudaros son Heroes❤!!!!!
🙏
A young black man who is in distress and the cop doesn't shoot him? Clearly fake video
Jesus Jesus Jesus 🙌🏾🙌🏾 Thank you Jesus 👏🏾
I cannnniiii stanbd american cops. Is she in there ? WHAT DO YOU THINK MAN?!? 😂😢
🙏🏿 to there family
HE RAN TO SAVE HIS MOMS LIFE.
Thanks for your kindness❤
But racism 😮
God bless the child. The mother should never stop loving you, and he not never stop loving her. He showed us how much love he had for his mother by saving her life. God bless you.❤❤❤❤❤
Prayers for you
Espero que  aqueles homens salvaram a mae
It’s annoying that he asked if someone is in the car. He literally told you his mom is in there having a seizure. Every second counts.
He stayed calm and collected. He wanted to make sure someone was in there. Yes the boy was crying for his mom but he needs to give a clear yes or no answer so the cop can legally take reasonable action from.
OMG THIS CHILD IS SO BRAVE CALL MOM, EVEN THOUGH HE IS CLEARLY UPSET TURN THE OFFICER WHAT IS GOING ON !!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I HOPE THE MOM HAS A SPEEDY RECOVERY AND IS OKAY !!!!!
I wasnt impressed by the cops sense of urgency, get your ass in the water.
أطفال غزة دائما في هذا الرعب
This cop is pretty fucking useless if u ask me
Is anybody here, can you pleas open the door, wtttf is he stupid
But, God
OMG this child is so brave !!!! OMG HE SAVED HIS MOMS LIFE !!!!
Samaritans are actually a real group of people who live in Israel, and the good Samaritan narrative just works to erase their actual identity and replace it with an imagined one.
Knock knock knock "excuse me ma'am, can I see your licence, registration and insurance?"
Not exactly rushing to save her are they ffs
😱🙏😭
Good Samaritan cop? That’s his job?
Having a seizure and then finding yourself underwater in your car is so so terrifying. That child saved his mom with the help of a good Samaritan and a responsible cop.
i bless this child and his family with SELAM'etge of AHURAmazda 💫🤍🤚
No the hellcat😢
Omg que suerte que encontró ayuda el niño que susto tan grade.
Yo cops get me so tight sometimes yelling talking about is anyone in there smh
😢😢
This cop was slow
These cops are useless. You can hear them screaming while he’s asking if anyone’s in the car
Thank you officer for understanding the assignment
👌
I cry every time I see this. He went up and beyond the call.   Hopefully  he was awarded their highest medal and one month or 2 with   paid vaction or time off. The son should also be given a heros  honor  and awarded  .🎉🎉❤❤
You can really say that he doesn't want to help her because it's a black family!!! Typical American Nazi cop😢 as he goes home and wife asks him how's your day, he probably said" I had a very very bad day because I saved the live of a black woman"
Thought ot was cool
The lil boy did the rescue💪🏾💪🏾… the cop didn’t do much but ask dumb questions 🤷🏾‍♂️
Man stabbed to death, blood everywhere...  Officer: Sir are you ok, Sir why aren't you answering me?  🤦‍♂️
Повернешся спиной он нож в спину воткнёт, или ограбит.
Damn, he had his window breaker for this exact moment.
I just googled this and 2 other men from a nearby factory help rescue mom from the car and the cop did cpr. All three received an award for their bravery.
I don't think I'd be asking if someone is in the car before jumping in after the boy just frantically told me his mother is in there having a seizure.
did you get he??
stupid cop asked is somebody inside omg
Poor baby, I can't imagine what he's going through and how he's feeling.  I'm crying for him.
bro slowest cop ever
This might be a dumb question but im curious; are the body cams waterproof?
prayers! good for you little brave son!!
The first cop reaction was too nonchalant for me...when they arrived at the car it did not appear he was moving fast enough based on the fact that the mother was already under water.
Cop's sense of urgency : none
That cop was taking his sweet time getting over there.
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Probably either high on drugs, or drunk.....
Poor baby 😫😭😭😭😭
Bro why are you screaming "is somebody in there" when the boy already told you she is and she wont answer if shes unconsious underwarter 💀 she couldve been dead thanks to your stupidness.
That poor boy! I hope his mom ended up ok! How terribly scary!
Pauvre gosse le traumatisme! 😢😢😢
Cop didnt want to save as they were black family 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Goodness can he move any slower yes he said my mom's in there 😢
the reason you can't judge all police officers you have some good some bad and some heroes ❤️🙏🏽
wy is it dramatic rescue
يا الله الحمد لله انقد امه
That cop has a heart of gold.
Please tell me she made it
When seconds count, you can always count on police to be minutes away.
Gracias a Dios están a salvo 🥹🥲
沒有警察的話，誰來救他媽媽？ 警察才是英雄！！
The cop was super slow wow.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Pobrecito mi amor 😢😢😢😢
Cop sure didn't rush 😢
and the Black people will still always find a reason why they hate cops. I'll bet you that kid gets older he'll be like "He didn't rescue her correctly we are suring"
Em vez do policial correr logo pra ajudar, ficou lá vendo o desespero do menino e o tempo passando. Depois viu o carro afundado e ainda ficou caçando mosca. Que horror de profissional.
Thank God , may he continue to have favor
Dumb a$$ cop!!! How stupid can this cop be by asking,  "Is anyone in there," after the fact the little boy told him that his mom is having a seizure.  He never calls for paramedics. This is so scary to watch why the kid is distressed. 😢
Hopefully she's ok.  My heart broke for her son. What an amazing kid and whoever helped him.  Thank God for these good people
Grata por informar ela está viva oremos se recuperar Jesus amado
Poor kid, mannnnn, to be honest, I can't stand 90% of the humans but to see a kid in this kind of desperation break's my heart, kids still have future you know? They not assholes yet
😮😂❤😅🎉❤❤❤
THANK YOU GOD❤
Nao sei por que não abriram primeiro a mala para entrar no carro e salvá- la
excuse me mam, its illegal to park there.
Awesome, he is. Continue to be brave young man... Blessings and speedy recovery to the Mom...
Kamala wants to Defund the Police
Where tf did she get her license from? A fucking cereal box?
Good for that young man be able to tell what's wrong with his mom.  Very brave through all of this
That poor boy omw 😪😪😪
Cop needs to show some hustle
God bless that little boy. Drowning survivor here, my car looked exactly like that but upside down in the water during my accident. I can personally tell you that this little boy is a true hero because I know what his mother went through in that car if she was conscious while trapped underwater and I don’t wish that on my worst enemy.
THANK YOU YESHUA!!!!🎉❤
I'm glad everyone is ok. Respectfully, people with a history of seizures should not be allowed to drive. She could've collided with another vehicle or ran into pedestrians or even someone's home. Not safe at all.
Brilliant son 👏 bravo 👌 in saving his mother 👨‍🍼 👌 wow 👏. Some of these evil 😈 sickness being on earth 🌎 are so unbearable 💔. Hopefully she gets better from it
👏🏼🙏🙏❤
She had a seizure and sunk in it was horrible experience
cops dumb bro jus told u someone in the water
Him hesitating asking “is someone in there” pissed me off..if she was incapacitated and couldn’t respond it’d be like, “no?? Nobody?? Okay.. well good news kid she’s not inside 😄”
Muchas prisa no se ha dado, se podría haber ahogado 3 o 4 veces. El pobre chaval se deja el alma en avisar
Glory to God❤❤❤
all love for the boy
YES HIS MOM IS IN THERE HE JUST TOLD U TAKE ACTION LAWD
Bless that little boys heart. He was so scared for his momma.
God bless those that helped to save this women. God bless this momma and son. 🙏💙🩷
Not a Good Samaritan it’s her son lmao
That cop honestly passed me off.  That poor baby boy was so scared.  Hurt to watch
Did the mom survive???
my guy needs to get a sense of urgency wtf he moving so slow for
He took his fucking time
Driving is so dangerous. The kid knew she was having a seizure so I doubt it’s the first. I understand how busy life can get especially with kids. I just hope she didn’t know she was an epileptic. Too risky
Lot of people are heart broken for this child who was about to lose his life and mum God forbidden yet there are thousands of them are losing their entire families and lives in Gaza right Now and most of these same people here don’t care what a world!
Gonna stand there asking if anyone's in there 🤦‍♂️ the kid told you fool!
“Is she in there? Is somebody in there” Dudes he’s been crying out that his mom was stuck in there from the beginning. Thank God for the braveness of everyone and that she was rescued 🙏🏾♥️
Oh Lord let her be okay❤
Cop barely believed the child that's crazy this kid came up to you clearly told you what the situation was and you stood there "is she is there? Is somebody in there?" A total stranger acted before  a cop is wild
God bless this child. Why isn't he on the national news? Why don't we hear about stuff like this?
Gators just lurking like 👀.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
It was so obvious that cop did not want to get into that water 😂
Muy mala la filmación.  No se puede estar ambos lugares😮😮
oh my GOD!😮😮the boy is the hero.... ❤❤❤❤❤
Copper took his time
ok 1st.. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 buttttt.. why tf u movin so slow and askin if someone is in there? the kid literally said she had a seizure.  also.. u think the kid was driving orrr?
why was she in the water?
Ow die Arme jongen en de Mensen in de auto help hun  mijm God
It's great to see a rescue, but was the cop seriously yelling "Is somebody in there" to a car completely underwater? The damn kid just told you she's in there and he's soaked. What do you think, Einstein?
“Momma please” got me 😢
The cop is so dumb, he seems like he is taking his time to go to the car asking if someone is in there🫣. Thahhh, didn't the child say she was having a seizure? Would she be able to respond if she was unconscious?   Please listen and run to help. The woman is safe because of the child that is clear!!!!
OMG. Those cop cameras work underwater!!!!   How come they don't work when people getting beat up????...god bless that cop and kid
🙏
Are they ok
great video... but that is not "good samaritan" if he is a cop; that's his job.
@bumphries1360 Thanks for taking the time to find out the result of this clip , glad to hear it all turned out well !
Racist.
😢😮poor baby he’s terrified. His desire to save his mother is beautiful.❤
Is she in there?
They have to show this mom the video for her to know how much her son loves her❤❤❤
Poor kid to go through that. I am troubled that he knew what it was. Should she have been driving? Did she epilepsy and how well was it controlled?
❤
This is the oath that they take to protect and to serve. Not to harm and ignore.  This is the true essence of a good cop. You're supposed to have my back and I got yours
That baby's desperate to get his momma some help!! Please LORD, LET EVERYTHING TURN OUT OKAY 🙏🙏🙏
God bless the boy and the man who helped him:.I hope they do well🙏
Thank u for sharing my hey was crying for the boy and thanks to God  and the boy getting help thanks to the men who helped saved his moma life  God is good yall 🙏 ❤
lol I saw that hesitation, he didn’t want to get wet but good save regardless
"Is the car unlocked?" Sir, who the fuque cares?
God bless this man for saving the boy's mums life 🙏 ❤
That officer was a little too calm 👀  , it's good she was able to be saved
What an incredibly brave child! The love that boy has for his mother is strong enough to get him out of that car, out of the water and get to someone for help, and he succeeded! He’s going to grow up to be an amazing man.
Mi amor que desesperación que tiene por su mamá
I watched this way too many times for my sensitive heart and soul. That baby said, "Momma please! My mom!Help her!" 😢💔
I’m surprised he didn’t ask for ID and registration with the stupid questions “is their anybody in there”. Even though the kid told that fat overthinking cop that  his mother had a seizure and she’s in the car, it seems like he went back too his cop car for a window punch. Have it before you get too the car, what did the cop think he was gonna do? Just go to the car and open the door.
Thank  God this  young boywas able to get Help. May god  the police officers and every that helped. Pray everyone  had a full recovery.
I like how they just left the car without grabbing there mom and then expect cops to go get her 😅😅😅 ahhh
Omg 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Why didn’t the kids try and help?
That poor little boy 😢.  Thank God mom was ok too.
Será que sobreviveu ?
God is so faithful. Thank goodness that the policeman was in the right place at the right time. Hats off to to son for reacting and knowing what to do... he helped save his moms life.
Call 🤙 EMS hurry up ...
Good Samaritan?!? That's a cop, doing his duties. Not a "Good Samaritan"
God Bless pray 🙏 this ended well 🙏
God bless you baby I am so proud of you for saving your brother's life thank you officer for not seeing color but seeing a person
Good job, all of you helped save, Lil Man'z, Ma.
The poor mother. If you've ever had a seizure, you know she watched all this happening while being able to do absolutely nothing about it. You fight like hell but nothing.
What did the cop expect a drowning woman to say?? 'I'm just waitin for a mate'
😢😢😢😢

Congratulations 🎊 to all of them the little boy trying to save his mother and the Man in the water and Police officer Bless you all.

anyone know why the car was in the water
He is a very brave boy I remember when I was around I’d say 8 or 9 and my mother was having a mental withdrawal due to her illness and she couldn’t remember anything. She was on her way to take me to school but she just couldn’t remember the way that day. I tried to direct as much as I could remember even while she drove through a small alley and her side view mirror broke off. We almost drove into a 4 way lane of oncoming traffic but I desperately told her to park which she remembered how to do. I rushed out of the car found the nearest person, told them the situation and to call 911. I did this also while not being too far from my mom yet not in the car in case she pulled off but thankfully she didn’t pull off. The police came to take her to the hospital and they asked if I wanted to go to school or with my mom and I said to school because I know that’s what she would have wanted. She wound up passing away when I was 11 but she was able to go to my elementary school graduation in a wheelchair. 😢
That’s heart breaking man, hope they’re much better now. Sending love and prayers your way young man.
The cop wasn’t the one helping
Omg!! His desperation hurt me 😢💔🙏🏽
same people same cars, wonder why insurance goes crazy on these :D
Amém ! Que esse garoto seja usado nas mãos de Deus para salvar vidas , em nome de Jesus .

Wtf people 🤦🏽‍♂️
Jesucristo ten misericordia que ella este bien😢
This is why women shouldn't drive muscle cars
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
The slow approach "Is somebody in there?" is the most stressful thing for me. She's having a seizure and is under water. She can't breathe. How is she supposed to to talk? Rush in there and save her
All three that day were destined to SAVING her.  Somebody prayed for all of them.  GOD does Answer prayers.  Great 😌 job!!  🙏🏽🤍
So slow at helping
Thank yo  ❤❤❤
شكرا للشاب الذي انقذ ام الطفل
So am I the only one thinking this cops reaction time was irritating? The kid said she's had a seizure, save her. You see a car in the water, fuckin get in there!!!
Tu principal interés era estar grabando no ayudar pero es acción que hiciste con Dios la vas a pagar Pero ella  tú con tu corazón pero Dios sí sabe tu intención exacta
😮😢😢😮
And people hate men and police
"Is somebody in there!?" Run!!! Go and f$ckìng look, man!!!!!!!!!  😡
You are wunderfull man
😢😢😢❤
Kid - She had a seizure she sunk  The dude - is she in there 😅
We thank the Lord for this good Samaritan obedience, and God and trust in him. The desperate cry for the child for his mother may God grant him grace and mercy.
That ppoor child, how scary. But hes a hero, as well as the man who helped them. 🙏🌹🙏
Ja morreu esse temo todo,deus falhou mais uma vez.
Seizure + driving a vehicle + water. Worst combo ever OMG
Its not safe for people that have seizures to drive at all it's too dangerous for them and any passenger their transporting. This is so sad. Thank you Father for her son ❤
That cop asked if there was anyone in there 😒 Like duh. And he didn’t sound like he cared enough. Thank God for the son and whoever else was in that water before that cop.
Cop was slow
The kid said what he said and you are suppose to take off running towards the situation but you have a slow reaction. You know what he told you but you get up to the water stop and ask if she's in there 2× (time is death) but you moving like a snell. This woman survived but it was not because of the police, a citizen jumped in and saved her, but like 8-9cops got awarded a recognized for the rescue. He was trying to stall because she was black, they do this because it seems like they are concerned but the actions don't match the concerns. Anyone whos really concerned moves with a purpose, this cop is walking dead.... Lets be honest people what would you have done to save a life.
He was in the water too poor boy so brave
Und was bringt das zu Filmen? Ohne filmen wären die Hände freier!
How much does that poor kid look like Liam from _"Shameless"_.
Le gosse a sauvé sa mère mais n'oublions pas le sauveur bravo aux deux mille mercis au sauveur.
Did they save her
« Is somebody in there » is mind blowing when this little child told you that his mother was in the car having a seizure
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏Salute To This Child 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Useless mom🙄🙄🙄
Glad he aint rascist
Poor baby man 💔
I'm crying I'm happy they are ok. I'm everywhere😢😢😢
Pauvre enfant courage à lui
I know mama cried and hugged her baby so tight when she saw this video
In samaritain qui filme..qui pense à ca dans l'urgence ?
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
My mom told me that cars are actually designed to float up at the trunk area so you can climb up there and break the back window. Thats also why it's weaker than the front (and i think the side windows? I dont remember) in situations where the car ends up in water like that.  Obviously it's not 100% but it's useful to know bc i somehow never thought about it
The cop hesitating to get in the water is infuriating
TOO MANY REASONS TO GIVE YOU PRAISE OH LORD!!!! , YOU ARE GOOD ❤🎉🎉❤❤
if i was black i wont trust the police anymore particulary this policeman...its clear he did not want to save  by hes own this litle  hero mam... how can u asked if some body is there seing someone trying to brake the window to rescue someone...they are more  speed, to pull there guns out and fire..on un armed blk people...its hurs me as white cause  this country need all of he's citizen.
Oh gosh , i am just crying buckets..i could not imagine my mum bing in that situation at thst age!!
Wow, this young man was actually in that sinking car with his mom and 16 year old sister!! He saved them both! Glory to God in the highest for giving this young man the ability to get the help to save his family!!!!
Very slow cops.. "is she in there? Is somebody in there?" If mom in house cooking stew, his kid never cry and panic in front of you.
"is somebody in there?"  really bro?
our policemen would never wet their clothes just to save a person.
Omg there are many good people in this world
Should people that have seizures be allowed to drive?
I just wanted to hug him. Poor baby he was just so desperate to save his mama
❤🙏💪🙌👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Hot damn folks she's going to be okay thank the Lord in heaven that guy was there what's got enough to jump in after her and her brave little baby boy will always be hero she gave him life and that he gave her life!  little man is such a hero!❤
The first cop was moving too slow. It was the other cop that saved her.
parents, teach your kids about the emergency handbrake. luckily this kid was able to get out and go ask for help. kudos to him.
Was she okay?
Why you driving if you have siezures 🙈 . Take a bus, spend life with your kids not in a grave or jail cell
Она живая?
oh god. poor baby
Главное снимать
Ah yes that came in the german news
God bless that officer,speaking calmly to soothe that boy,&  efficiently rescuing the mother. Thanks for sharing.👍💪😎💐💐
a life was saved ,that young man will have a mother to hug again ,the Lord's timing is perfect and all who were there will know that ! 🙏
The kid says there's someone in there crying. The cop, is there someone in there? Seconds count in this situation.
God bless everyone that saves his  mother
THE POLICE WASN'T  A HERO.  HE TOOK HIS OWN SLOW TIME.    HER NAME WASN'T. GABBY.😢😢😢😢
Deus salva essas vidas !
Dat raycizt cop
I cried with rhe way the kid explained.  The kid almoat have an heart attack for his first love. We all love our first love
How the hell could you say dramatic? This is not dramatic
The incompetence from that cop is next level. “Is somebody in there?” Bro, fucking obviously, you think that kid is a Grammy award winning actor or something!?
LORD, THANK YOU, JESUS but Please give an update
Man all those Dumb Questions... 🤔💭Help her!!
Ohh JEOVÁ salve a mãe dessa criança 🙏🙏
Good Samaritan? It’s his job as a cop 😅
Cop took forever until the other guy jumped in
Has to be the most unbelievable dumbest cop..... Asking all of those questions he Just explained...🤔💭 Is somebody in there??? Is the car unlocked 🤔💭😒 the intelligence of a potato skin.
I noticed all the comments are talking about the child nobody talked about the officer the officer was a hero they could have just walked by he could have not cared but he was a good Samaritan he was  he was a good person in a tough situation.❤
Amen thank God for all involved..
💜💞🫶💞💜
Stupid fucking cop, “is somebody in there?” Like, no shit detective! Asking stupid questions like the submerged recently seizures woman is going to him, open her door, and give a thumbs up.
Bro that police guy mentally ill
That baby crying just brought me to instant tears
Why she is driving in the water
“is somebody in there!?” fn, u see a boy covered in water tellin u she in dere
Удивительно! Спасает, но продолжает снимать видео для Tik Tok
Meu Deus tem misericórdia a Judá Senhor Jesus
What a brave boy
The cop yelling "is there somebody in there?" While the vehicles is submerged in water expecting an answer is wild. Like why would you not just believe a kid, clearly he wasn't driving 😒
Точно не русский,какие съёмки надо спасать ,каждая секунда на счету
Thank goodness there was already someone there saving the mother and not asking ridiculous questions.
Boy: she's having a seizure and trapped Cop: you in the car lemmi see your hands! Do not breath!!
FUCK THIS HAPPENED ON MY GF'S BIRTHDAY TOO?! FUCKING DAMN...
Why the fck do you even drive if you know you can have a seizure????  Why put în risk your family and other participants? Go with a bus or find other ways to get to your destination.  Sorry but that mom is irresponsible
🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️‼️‼️‼️
That says west orange tx I use to live there
So brave a sons love is like no other...❤
Thanks to the guy who saved her life and the boy too, well done
Well well well
Kudos som kudos youre so brave and so is the man saving her!!❤
Heartbreaking - boy was so overwhelmed yet strong and determined. How did that boy get out yet all doors were locked?
That cop is stupid. No shit someone is in there. The child say his mom is in there. OMG everyone should not be cops.
"Is somebody in there..." what a passive load
I pray for this lady to be okay
Having a seizure in the water for that long??.... yeah no sorry, this is fake asf
🙏🙏🙏
😢
😢 that brave little boy
😢🚘❤
Thank u for helping her. God bless u ❤
Could he go any slower?
God bless those people who saved that woman.
And that's why driving os banned for people with seizures!
Pfff les mêmes commentaires mais différents pour dire la même chose 😂
😢😢😢😢❤
Bravest kid!!
Thank God she's safe!!
“Is somebody in there?” “ mom! “ so a drowning person possibly passed out from seizure is suppose to answer you?
Brave boy
Wow😢
😢
I hate how he asked if somebody was in there like dude 😒
Je trouve que ke policier prend tout son temps quand même.....apres c est peut-être ça manière de travailler efficacement.....bref c est juste mon opinion
E a mãe ? Sobreviveu? O semblante deles não era bom
Not entirely sure what happened entirely, but where is this cops desperation?
Если случаются припадки, как можно садиться за рудь. Это не допустимо. По этой причине и бывают большие аварии. Надо думать об окружающих людях.
Thank God for their lives. Jesus is Lord!!!
Am I the only one with tears listening to the boy tears and crying out for help?  Glad the officer and the Good Samaritan helped but that officer wasn’t moving fast enough for my liking …, .. I pray the lady is ok and if she has seizures she STAY FROM DRIVING because she could’ve killed herself, her son and anyone else on the road…
The police see and still  ask..ugg
😁
But did she catch a fish?
This shit half underwater and he casually walks up asking if it’s unlocked.    wtf.   Zero sense of urgency
I hope she made it I hope she's not dead 😢
Just keep asking the water if anyone’s in their 😂😂😂😂
Quelle horreur
He took long...
Que Amor de Hijo y Gracias a los Que Ayudaron Un Milagroso Para su Mamá Una Nueva  Oportunidad De Vivir Gracias a Dios  Bendiciones ♥️🌎♥️
I hope this heroic child and his mother make a healthy recovery
abc xyz joker
What the fuck is wrong with that cop ??? Je told hom right away, MY MOM IS IN THE CAR !  Man obwohl have screamed like crazy, Str you du, Go in there ans fesche my mom you Idiot ! UNBELIVABLE, Wartung time ....😢
😢😢😢 God please let her be ok and let this kid find peace with this traumatic experience.
I’m so impressed that the cop and the Good Samaritan didn’t push the boy to the side. They treated him like the capable person he was and directed him to help. They treated him and his momma with respect. 🙏🙏 and gratitude for humanity
And they want to defund the police
Update? Is the ,mother and children doing okay? Regardless child shows good strength in resilience leadership and courage characteristic traits. Hopeful they found the mother in time that they reunited
"Good Samaritan Cop"??? That's his job.
Bro asking is anyone in there and he’s sayin his mom is in there before they got there like bro knew wtf he was doing tryna stall
I hope Mom Son and anyone else made a full recovery ❤🙏🏽🕊️
I broke down hearing the boy crying to the cop
That child had me crying😢😢🙏🏾😔😇❤️
Mate the cop done fuck all what are people saying 😂😂😂😂 you could tell he's diving into dunking doughnuts daily 😂😂
“My moms in the car!”  “Hello is there anybody in the car!?” 🥸
Cop was moving….
Shush it lil raisin
Poor kiddo he knew someone had to get her out the car 🥹💔
If you have a history of seizures please please do NOT drive children around. I get it can be convenient, but that could've cost somebody's life.
why are u so slow bro she was DROWNING
Gators??
Is the car unlocked? Go find out wtf? Is somebody in there? Yeah dude do you not hear the kid? What planet is this dude on?
What a brave little boy 😢
Police officer had a joint he is to relaxed.   Move quickly for goodness sake.
Geez, its just a mother 🙄.
That poor boy. How terrifying for him. I hope his mom is ok.
Idiot cop..." The mom in there?" The kid says she's in the car? Duh!
Only God
Just a miracle for the survival of this brave child and his mother, plus they had angels willing to sacrifice their lives to save a complete stranger.  This is LOVE & compassion in action!
Thank you officer!
Little man is a strong individual! Bless him and his mother! Plus the heroes that were there for the rescue!
Is the officer srsly that slow trying to save a life?
😂😂😂😂🎉❤
🙏🏽Thank the Most High for the youth having enough strength & courage to get further help! This is what heroes are made of!
Kid : "she had a seizure she's in there"  Cop: she's in there!!??
Omg bless him Lord, ik it was muddy and very dangerous, but this stranger risked his life to save this childs mother. ❤️
Lütfen arabanızda Acil durum Cam kırıcı ve emniyet kemeri kesici bulundurun internetten bulabilirsiniz
I’m not impressed by any means of the officer. Compassion is at a low. Although grateful.
Very nice save
Thanks for the outcome?! Hate video's like this..
When the cop starts talking with unbelievably  😢???? 😢😢Her child told him that she was seizing and sunken in the water. Why would he call out to her like she was gonna answer back? Her child was brave to tell the officer to help his mom now! knocking on the car door like she wasvgonna answer, and yelling out "Mam are you in there, step it up!" 😢 mom had a seizure while driving, so she's was unconscious or lethargic from the seizure itself. My daughter had seizure for 20yrs. Sending ❤s
Mom:drowning slowly while knocked unconscious  Cop:is she in there? Well is she in there?...
Did she survive ? ❤
Jeszcze ten murzynek nie trafił do Polski!!!???
Kids saved his mom’s life, and also that accent from the man was like a movie. “Come on, hop in” in the most country southern accent.  I feel like I just watched a movie scene
The officer was slow to move. How many times did he have to say she's in the water?
That cop is too calm for my liking
Jesus!!❤
Is that Liam from Shameless?
Wenn ich das Kind sehe Zerbricht es mir das Herz
Dumbest cop ever. Could he have been any slower…..Seriously the kid was helping out more than him.
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 To God Be the Glory
We cannot get heros all of the times. That is a God sent angel. License should not be given to permanently and  physical of any issues so that they don't encounter dangerous accidents which can be avoided 😢😢😢.
What a rescue good job kid a cop save his mom❤
kid just told the cop his moms in the water sinking and he gon ask "is somebody in there?" 🤦🏽‍♂️
This the kinda stuff that gets 5 min of air time.
Get in the water fast .. somebody in there
Took his time
❤❤❤🙏🙌🙏🙌🙏 GOD'S BLESSINGS UPON ALL 🙏 AMEN 🙏
What a loving child he is! God blessed the woman with a best child she could ever dream of. ❤
What kind of "good Samaritan" asks if someone is DYING in the car that calmly as of kid didn't just SAY SHEA IN THE WATER....WTF. honestly I don't care he could have actually TRIED.
I'm so glad this boy was allowed to be born. Whoever gave birth to him, thank you.
EST CE VOLONTAIRE?? 👉Comment rien n'est prévu pour ce dégager du véhicule, situation inévitable,en cas de chute dans l'eau
Wow that’s incredible. What a great kid and great men saving that woman. This is one of my worst nightmares I used to dream about it too and used to be nervous driving over bridges. They have brought out a new tool that helps break car windows that you can keep in your glove box or bag as that glass is so hard to break. Worth getting it to help save lives.
Shouting out if someone is in there serves what purpose of the person is drowning or knocked out 🙄
Cop moving slower than a tortoise
GOD BLESS
First off it’s good the cop helped but my thing is this… WHY ARE YOU CALLING OUT TO THE PERSON IN THERE ASKING IF SOMEONE WAS IN THERE WHEN THE KID WAS JUST CRYING AND ABOUT TO PASS OUT HIMSELF TELLING U HIS MOM WWS IN THERE…🤔🤔🤔he could hardly breath trying to get out she’s in there and then he’s calling out mom
❤
The boy desperate cries to save his mom. My mom is in there pls help her .The police meanwhile is she in there? Is anyone in there?? The police was too slow to respond to that emergency situation .
The officer broke the window to save the mother.   What did he use?   It wasn’t a hammer. 😊lease let us know so we are also prepared in the event we come across something like this or even for our own safety from inside the vehicle
Not the cat man
That baby saved his Mama. He looks young too, the fact that he was able to get out and get help, I have chills.
Thanks God for sending that person on His way... Thank You Jesus 🌌🕊️🙏🏻
Why would he ask is somebody in there when the little boy clearly said my mom in there.
Back window.. the back will float
The cop didn’t seem very urgent it’s like he was annoyed
poor kid
😢
Why wait and ask? Do your job Ofie!!
The ones complaining in the comments wouldn’t have done shit so just shut up!
У американцев ужасно работает полиция! Медлительные как ленивцы! Другое дело в России сразу бы спасли! В америке тупые копы😂😂😂
The cop is an idiot
😢😢😢😢Jesus poor. His lil soul was hurt ❤thankful she survived
So many negative comments about the cop. Yet you are all the same kind of people who would have taken a video as you drove by.
Just sending Gods blessings to them both. He save her. Blessings to him also
Heroes. Both of them.
Cops an idiot 😭, repeatedly told someone is drowning in the car and then repeatedly asks if someone is in the car...
Jesus made a miracle!
Is somebody in there? Nah, the cast just drove itself in the water.
Feeling sad for the boy😢 Also I don't get it, if mom knows she gets seizure, why driving a car in the first place? Poor boy. He have to witness it and will never never forget this incident when he grows up! God bless this family 😢❤❤❤❤
Real hero ❤❤❤
He taking hella long doe talkin bout Good Samaritan
The distress from that boy is so raw and sobering
Thank you for helping, you and the boy are heroes 💗 God bless yous🙏
❤
Why is the cop so slow 😡
The kid said 10 times his mom's underwater and the officer asked the kid 15 times if somebody's in there like he didn't want to get wet. We need fit officers
This young man was extremely brave! I know you made your mama proud. Prayers for a speedy recovery 🙏🏼 🫂♥️
What an unfit officer to come to an emergency like that. We need well-funded fit officers I want a Marvel hero to come save me in my emergency. Not a cop handing Samaritan tools to do his job.
Mannnn'... This was rough
I hope the little boy heals from this traumatic event
Cops an asshole. If it was his goofy ass kid he would have moved MUCH FASTER..TF typical...
🙏❤️ Lord thank you Jesus AMEN 🙌 🙏 ❤️
Obama would say that cop is racist
My daughter has seizures she dont drive. Your not allowed to have a license in some states if you have seizures but people wont say anything and drive.   Im so glad she is okay and the son. Thats scary . This is why i like windows you roll down n doors without electric locks. 😢😮
This story was on Good Morning America 5 days ago, along with Inside Edition. God bless All that were involved. It infuriates me when people make negative comments on situations like this, especially without knowing the facts! MayThank God for the 12 yr old son, the officer that jumped in, along with the Good Samaritan who has stayed in touch with the family!❤
Cop could have moved with some urgency from the get go…
That officer taking his time walking to the car🤦🏽‍♂️ W KID FOR SAVING HES MOM
But everybody says FTP and defund the police... without him that woman probably wouldn't have been saved
Tell EMS to step it up!! God was already there🙏 i hope that baby understands what a hero he was for his mama❤
God bless that brave baby boy! I pray both him and his mother are okay!
You guys are too slow...
How tf u pick up a lil boy saying his mom was in there and still ask "is someone in there"   obviously she not gonna fuckin answer
😢😢😢😢😢
Gracias      al niño         quehayuda
Did this woman make it?
THAT COP WAS NOT IN ANY KIND OF RUSH..
why are we driving with epilepsy?
Тупой режиссер нет чтоб помочь он снимает на камеру 👎👎 американец 😂

So proud of this young boy! 😮
Thanks for your work!
Copy was slow as hell
Is there  a follow up to this story
Wow such a beautiful thing ❤❤
Oh my god, poor baby. I gope his mom is okay
Anyone in the car no shit dummy
That cop hesitated... Talking bout "is shein there? Is anyone in there?".. yea dufus, you forgot the reason you were even there? Being a cop takes guts and bravery. This guy didnt pass the vibe test in my opinion
Theres easier ways to get rid of your child without ruining your car. Smh. These ghetto bums
How dumb, to be calling out, "is there somebody in there" in a car half submerged in water. Furthermore, when the boy had already told the "deaf" officer that his mum is in there. Goodness, in times of emergency, you wouldn't want such a person.
Are cops good Samaritans by default for doing their job?
that officer was in a BIG hurry to save that lady... :/
Bro why tf the cop just stand there asking if someone was in there like wtf ofc there is there’s a damn child crying about it telling u like use your fucking brain
I get why that child is desperate and frustrated. That cop's sense of urgency is completely lacking. Next time speed it up my guy.
That’s my home town. Never thought I’d see it on YouTube.
Any American would try to save that black child’s mother…no systemic racism. We care about everyone because ALL LIVES MATTER.
Did he pull her out too?? I can't tell who brought her over
Hope that she ceases driving unlesshe gets the seizure disorder under control. Confronted my friend, _"Why no turn signal?"_ Then saw that he was having a petit mal seizure and trying to control it.    His car was drifting right, luckily where the off-ramp began.     Holding histeering wheel, (did I engage his righturn signal?), I guided his car to the curb why slowly pulling the center handbrake ON and bringing his car to a gentle stop.       He recovered in 5 minutes and we continued.   Told him he had to get hiseizures under control or I would alert authorites and have his license revoked.   He wento a MD.
it just seems the officers response is slow.  the kid already said his mom is in there... asking is anyone in there, is the car unlocked... he should be running like hell with his baton out to break the window if needed.  She is in the water, she could be drowning already so every second counts.  You can ask questions as you run over.  Kid is screaming help her while his is taking his time asking questions.  thank goodness that other guy was already in the water before he actually decided to get wet.
So scary I hope the mother is okay 😢❤
So scary 😮
I agree with the cop EMS needs to step it up
Brave kid
I pray they are both on the road to recovery from this traumatic event 🙏🏽🙏🏽
This happened on my bday???!
The “white man” helped out in the situation. Very important to maintain that. Both words “white” and “man”.
I wonder how yall even think about recording, let alone take the device with you and film while  you  rescue someone's life.
So off topic but with headphones in it sounds like when you get in the shower and your ears are plugged with water
Oh my GOD Is she ok ?
My gawd water ain’t so damn difficult learn to swim
Damn, that dude saved her life.
The liberals in the comments ruin the overall message of the entire video. It’s just a kid desperately trying to save his mother and someone being there to help. Quit making it more than that.
TO ALL OF YOU THAT CHANTED TO DEFUND THE POLICE. Repent now!!!!
Whoever the man was that jumped in the water to get her out deserves appreciation as well.
Does Amy one know how this turned out? That boy is such a hero, as well as that man who helped them.
When every second counts it pissed me off for him not to automatically react, like if he was scared to get into the water or something.....is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? Really?
Hoffentlich 🙏 hat Sie überlebt sehr schlimm 😢
DIEU SOIT LOUÉ 😊😊
Sounds like someone's in there. Obviously shit
So very sad.😢😢😢😢 Great kid.❤❤❤😢😢
At the end of the day, most cops are in it to help people. Thats the lesson I get from this.
Pleased with response and follow up! Get well soon!
What f*cking traumatizing moment for that kid. I can’t even imagine what he was going through in that moment. Hope his mom is ok
Chit DID U GET POOR MOMM OUT MY GOD
Amen ❤Jehovah god and Jesus Christ is so good to us
Thank God this precious son had the courage and strength to save his mama, thank God. Oh thank God😢🙏🙏❤️😭😭😭
This is amazing and frustrating.  That cop seemed to take his sweet time imo
🙏🏽
Thank you for the update 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿and love ❤️ for the child and his mom and the officer for helping her
God is so good!
God bless everybody involved here.
bendiciones alos que la ayudaron.  te amo niño
Prayers 😢
God bless who help
Boy : my mom is inside  Cops : still don't believe              Asking hello anyone inside 😅 i am coming              Stupid cops
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I’m glad they got her out in time, but am I the only one a tad bit ticked off that the officer stood there asking if there’s someone in the car when the child LITERALLY just coherently explained everything that was going on?? Like he already said his mom was in there, why didn’t he just take his word for it and go check? What if the other guy hadn’t been there and it was just the little boy and his mother, would he have stood there and called out to a half sunken car with someone potentially seizing inside of it? Would he just not believe the child?? In the end all that matters is she was saved and the child is back with her.. but I hope next time this officer runs into a situation like this, he’s not so slow to react. 🤦🏻‍♀️
❤ 🙏🏾
Why are cops so dumb? “Is anyone in there?” 🤡
저 위 영상은 연출. 문이 닫힌 상태에서 차안의 사람 목소리 안들림. 고로 영상은 연출.
Seeing that kid panic..it’s hard to see..😢
2 things come to mind about this situation, either she hates her life and chose to end it with her son, or she fell asleep in the car because there’s no WAY in hell in a lonely road like that you “suddenly” end up in water
포크레인 부르셨어요?동시에 하셔야하죠. 사고날때 보험회사에서 출동하는 차로 건지면 5분이면 끝나요. 수압때문에 차문 안 열리는건 당연한거예요.
L cop bro waited there for like 30 seconds before he did anything
I don’t want to go with white cop helping black family. But I want to prove that there is humanity in this world.
Defund the police
My God help these people 😮🙏🏾🙏🏾
LIL MAN HERO SAVING HIS MOM PRAYERS 🙌🏾❤️🇧🇧🙏🏾

Oh my God Talking about God having yr spare in the bush (Gods enlightenment) God haveing allow everybody and everything in the right place at the right time!!! Hallelujah
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️
Thank U  for listening  to that child 😊😊❤❤❤
The most important question is rather or not this was a meth induced seizure.
Nooosssa, fiquei aflita com a dor e desespero desse garoto, doeu ver o sofrimento dele. Menino corajoso, graças a Deus ele conseguiu ajuda para resgatar a Mãe. Desejo a ele e sua família saúde, muita luz e paz 🙏
Did she survive?😮😢
Brave child and a great job of an officer was a blessing to ,and for all of us... God' is good...  If we could count our blessings,of the father God, we wouldn't have enough hands ,feet, arms,legs , just not enough of anything to be thankful for...
Pisses me off how slow moving this cop was. Holy shit dude fuckin retire. I respect you trying to serve but you ain’t cut out for it…
Aww poor boy
That's a blessing and the kid got out and got help
O my ... JESUS my heart goes out to them
Omg that poor poor baby 😢! He's def his moms hero
Stupid cop man the child told you momma is in there!
How is she doing now😮
❤❤❤
"MY MOMS IN THE CAR DYING" "ugh....is someone in there?....*sigh* really?! Is someone actually in there? *Sigh*"
It’s like he hesitated…hmm why the hell will you ask someone in water a question and expect to get an answer
Everyone giving credit to that cop yes he did save her but that child is so brave, and there was someone in the water with that cop
Way to take your sweet ass time
😢😢so glad the officer helped❤❤
I hope she is ok...
Don’t drink
😢😢😢😢😢😢
😥✝️🙏
God bless you sir and God bless the family🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Thank you brave souls!  Community
And in a related video, two cops stood feet away from a car submerged to it's roof with three young girls screaming for help.  The cops stood there as each of them drowned.  Officer safety prevented them from saving the three girls, as they stated they never received water rescue training.
Poor baby 🥹 Did she make it?
That officer was half assed asab
Did it seem like that child was kidding why keep asking get your ass in there wtf 😮
❤❤❤❤❤
God this is why people don’t even watch the news anymore yall always trying to push false narratives and stereotypes.
El policía hizo espero demasiado para ir al rescate🤦
Hope she's okay. Brave little boy 😢
The cop didn’t even fuckin save her
Orange texas
How terrifying! Poor kid. I hope they saved her 😢
Glad to know the mother survived and is okay.  She has a special son, who did his best to save her, and it worked. God bless the Civilian and Police Officer that helped extricate her from tge flooded vehicle. May the mother and child live a Long and Healthy,  Happy Life!!❤🎉😊
Help me white people
❤❤gracias
Thank God for these good folk helping
😔💔
Y la pregunta  mas tonta de la vida fue..... Hay alguien ahi?? 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
God bless that officer❤
I thought you said white cops are racists??!!
why cant i like this video its amazing the like wont show... Here is my love ❤ amazing the bravery of the boy
Did he not believe the kid or what?
The fact that he knows what it looks like when she’s having a seizure means that she has probably had them before. If you are prone to seizures, DON’T DRIVE. It is incredibly dangerous.
This is another reason I think everyone deserves healthcare.
God Bless you, young man, for being so brave to go find help to save your Mama. Grownups can't do what you did under such stress. I pray that you and your Mama will be safe. I am thankful for these strangers you called to her rescue. You will always have special friends for the rest of your lives. You are a wonderful hero, young man. Don't let anyone say that your tears were weak. You were strong and smart in a crisis. Young men such as yourself become leaders. 🙏✝️💜
come on pop p in  very easygoing talk ......the kid was scare to death  this was a very serious situation dramatic for the young boy there
Thanks God! For giving her a second opinion 🙏🏻✝️🕊
Sure took his fuggin time though. Now's not the time to mosey around, guy.
Why he so slow
who was the good samaritan??? i hope u not saying the cop was a good samaritan!
That cop took his time!!!! Then..HE DIDNT WANT TO GET WET! is somebody in there?.. is it locked? Like the kid didn’t LITERALLY EXPLAIN his mom is DROWNING from a SEIZURE!!😡  No officer GENIUS the car drove itself into the pond😶….🤦‍♂️😡  IMO… The officer…. actually only… **ASSISTED** the real heroes
Disgraceful judgement by folk seeing 20 seconds of a bad situation on a 8"screen with several gaps in cameras footage. How you get to ethnicity being a factor in this means youve been conned hook line and sinker, no hope for you im afraid the propaganda dug deep into your soul... The cop exhumed calmness. The cop gathered all the important facts. The cop was aware of a presence already situated in prime position and making progress. The cop then assisted the samaritan and offered equipment needed rather than vying for position or posturing to be "The Man". The cop then got the ball rolling on next and equally important phase of the rescue mission..... A car sinking in the water is not all off a sudden H2O and offers several vital seconds of air protection. The cop will of known such and knew that running around like an headless chicken would seriously reduce odds of a successful.. Id say a guy like that is balanced enough to know that all men are created equal...... and therefore is a sexist bigot!!........ Racist, dont be so predictable!!! 🤬🤬
The boy is a HERO! He was panicking but pulled enough energy to still get help and save his momma
😇😇✝️✝️
and we’re supposed to defund these guys. Gotta love America
Theres a star man waiting in the sky 🎶 🎵
Omg😢 Poor baby and mama.
❤❤❤❤❤
Cop is a remedial pos is someone in there like obviously dude the kid crying for ur help then it takes a random stranger to break widows for the cop to help should be fired not praised
better title: SON SAVES MOTHERS LIFE
Not him asking “is somebody in there” when the little boy literally just said his mom sunk in the pond. Could just be me but if my job is saving lives I’m RUNNING as soon as I see a car submerged almost completely in water ESPECIALLY if there’s a little boy yelling for help😢🥲
So glad this ain't Florida, glad she's okay tho
I know she made it
Why do I feel like he's moving too slow.. I feel that kids desperation 😢❤
Thanks you all!! Love saves us all!
Praise God!!!! Thanks to the cop and others involved.
This is real ❤❤
😮😮😢😢😢🙆🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
God blessed all of you
Kid - “my mums in the car help 😭😭” Cop - “is there someone in there?”  Naaa the boy has just made it up ffs
Poor kid.
Why on earth is that guy asking “ is there someone in there?) The boy was hysterical and crying, and told him she was drowning. Why did he deliberate for even a second before helping?? I’m appalled at the man’s ridiculously slow reaction to a clear emergency and can’t help but wonder if the woman would have faired much better had there been a quick response.
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
How did the kid get out of the car?
🙏✝️
why he moving so slow asking is somebody in there did that frantic child seem like he was making sht up to u ida hit that water on my belly and skid across the top getting to that lady every second is oxygen lossdamage
I’m so proud of you young man❤❤ you’re the best son ever
I pray she is okay
“Is somebody in there” …. Uhhhh idk 🤷🏻‍♂️
Good kid. Dont drive if you have seizures.
This is so traumatizing for them i hope they can recover and that cop couldn't of been any slower. Idc whos mama that is, for that time i am rescuing them they are my mama. Idk the urgency was all the child and the adults ask stupid questions.
Why tf is she driving
Y'all are so obsessed with hating cops that you can't help but to bash one of the good ones in the comments, huh?
What a Dip shit cop “is somebody in there?” Yeah no shit 😂
That guy was trying to be as slow as possible
Thank U LORD I Hope SHE'S OK!🙏🙏🙏🙏
Cop reacted slow asf that boy was frantic
So much urgency
IS SHE OKAY????
That little boy, OMG I just want to wrap my arms around him and hold on. I can’t imagine the fear in him at that moment! I pray that God gives him the comfort he needs to get through this accident. At that age I would have lost my mind and froze, not this young man, he was in rescue mode. Praying everything and everyone are ok!🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️
Her son and her daughter were in the car and the daughter stayed with the car and the son ran to get help. She survived y'all! The officer was able to resuscitate her. Wow!!! Amazing. Thank God!!
Prayers for the family God Bless Them Trust Jesus Christ
Poor lady had a seizure. That boy was so scared i hope Everything will be fine with them. Happy the cop Came to help the little boy is a hero too ❤
God bless this little one! This would be traumatic to an adult much less a child!
Why was that man ASKING THAT Dumb question? The baby came ran up to him saying save my mama, She’s in the car. She having a seizure. COME ON PEOPLE
The poor baby. I hope him and his mom are okay
Since the boy knew she was having a seizure, does this mean she was knowingly driving a car with a history of seizures? Is it legal to drive?
People don’t realize the love a boy has for her mom he swam ran and got help and didn’t stop till his mom was safe
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is she in there? Is the door unlocked?? Wth! Take action! Ask questions later !
You saved your mom! You’re a hero ❤️
Gracias  Dios. Eres bueno  ❤ y poderoso  gracias policía  siempre  Dios los bendiga  y los proteja  de todo  mal
THAT PRECIOUS CHILD, THANK GOD FOR HIM, HE HELPED SAVE HIS MOMS LIFE !!
Ya defund these dudes. That way instead of police saving this i would assume black lady, a bunch of idiots can stand around and film it with their phones for tik tok ane youtube. Lucky these guys showed up.
Why is the woman driving if she knows she has seizures…
Update please!
As bad as the situation is, if you’re prone to things like this, please put your safety and others safety first, just imagine if she’d hit someone with that thing
Is she in there is about the dumbest question
This marked him and I think this kid is going to grow up to be a Cop or a Firefighter when he grows up.
Thank goodness he got out to call for help. Seizure & Cancer is one of the worst symptoms to plague earth.
Any update? Was she okay??😢
Amm.. that look dead
That dude is an idiot.  So what did he think the kid was laying?  Instead  jumping  right in to save her he's  gonna let he drowned while he walks around  like a dope.
Omg ....why is she even driving this is so scary...thank god she is ok
People don’t understand the level of bravery the kid has to not have froze up or just drowned too & still managing to find someone
But why is he this calm as if it's not an emergency wow...
The hesitation to get on the water
Oh my good thats so dramatic!!! 😢😮
There was nobody but the cop and the women’s Son. Praise the Sons thinking under pressure! Thank God for that Police officer being in the right place at the right time!!!!
Congratulations to the officer who saved her, God bless you. I seen a cop in a storm that let a person drown in Texas because he didn't know how to swim 😭
Amen 😇
I hope everyone is ok now 🙏💗
Scarey stuff  he just saved his life
After watching this please please I hope it inspires all of you to buy one of those window breaker things to keep in your glove box they literally cost only like three or four dollars! Get a couple for your car and get a couple for your friends cars
Thanks for saving her God was on y'all's side God bless you all 🙏
Some good people still around!
Okay I’ll be the Karen here 😭😂I hope she wasn’t knowingly driving with that condition!!!!!
I was tearing up
Humanidad que todavía hace creer que somos buenos.
😢 thanks God
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
He took too long to get into action in my opinion. Ask questions later. If you busted the window and no one is in there then oh well.
What a dumb cop. What type of question is "Is there somebody in there?"
Good policing right here!!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
God Bless this brave man who helped save his Mom. Thank You, Lord, Thank You, Jesus.
God Bless you
😢
Why did the cop stand around and ask if anyone was in there????
Oh.rioa ayúdalo a todos y sácalo con bien .en tu nombre
Your the greatest Amen
Thank God the cry for help never go in vain ❤
Cops be stupid AF sometimes is she in there is someone in there?! Naa the kid just ran found you and said she having a seizure she sunk she's in the water 😂😂😂 I need to be a cop to see what I do in high stress situations can't be worse than the military.
Wow!!!!❤❤❤ Thank God for those angels!!! Hope she was ok
The cop is a ass hole for sure
Non mais attends😮 pour porter secours tu as besoin de ton fone😂  Pfff un fake   La réalité n'est pas toujours ce que  l'on voit Sachons écouter notre esprit et notre ❤️  PAS SEULEMENT CE QUE L'ON VOIT🤲🙏😘
Sheriff Jethro: "Iz sumbuddy in der?" after just being told that his mom was in there five seconds ago. What an idiot.
Gracias a Dios
That’s exactly why my mom’s doctor or told her she should drive when she was having her seizures
Why was he saying is somebody in there and the boy said his mom is in there 🤔
Brave boy, and cop! Hope she's ok.
Obrigado a este homem que ajudou o menino e salvou a mãe
Water is up to the trunk and cop is asking if anybody is there, like jump the fuck in buddy
😭 poor baby he’s so scared
Stupidest questions ever
My heart go out to this family and her son he did a wonderful job he could've painted but he He held it together. Thank God lots of prayers 🙏🏽🙏🏽💕🙏🏽🙏🏽
I wanna  thank the guy for helping....Thank you......
Lol it’s a dodge charger
God bless that gentleman. The poor baby. You could hear the desperation in his voice. I pray that she is doing well.
Thank you officer and the others that helped
Since when are cops samaritans?
Stupid ass cop.. “is someone in there.”  Kid was like my Mom help her!! I sensed no urgency in the cops demeanor.
Oh, bless his precious boy sweetheart. I did get frustrated with the police officer when he was yelling is anybody in there?? Her son just told you she was in there!!!
OMG cry😢😢 That poor baby it broke my heart. 💔💔 He reminds me of my son Qy’lee. Damn I miss him and love him soo much. 😭 😭 my little king😔😔
🙏 DIOS bless u both esp.the rescuer,& so aad 4 the boy✝️ JESÚS 🔥 ESPÍRITU SANTO ✨ VIRGEN MARÍA AMÉN 🇵🇷

Alguém saberia dizer se salvaram a mãe deste bravo garoto?
You did it buddy you saved your mom sending giant hugs ❤❤❤
Thank you Jesus
Poor little Guy... He knew he had to get help. Smart young man.
Why did he hesitate? Wht did he ask if anyone is inside its obvious thr car is upside down.
Al child of planet love the mum. We just watch a real love and what supposed to be for all . Is   just love.
Just gave me chills hearing the child asking for help in such a scared and frantic voice. Thank you for stopping and helping him save his mom
OMG!! How terrifying 😱💔💔💔 That poor kid and mom!  What a wonderful rescue!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
A little hero ❤
damn cop going so slow
Allah rahem kijiye ameen
Phenomenal GOD…
Wow the worst Time to have a sizure
Is the mom okay ?
That baby saved his mom’s life. I hope they’re okay
😮😮😮
Que chingon, gran persona
Y would he tell us somebody in there if the boy himself is telling him like come on now
kids crying telling you whats happening and you wanna sit there and ask him questions, get the fuck in there and do something!
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Man this was so painful to watch. 💔💔💔. That poor boy.
That cop has no sense of urgency Jesus Christ
Heros
❤❤❤
God loves that child. She was given a second chance because of this child. Mama stop driving if you are sick. Thanks to all those who too part in saving her life.
❤❤❤Thank God 🙏🙏🙏
He sounded like he used his last breath to say his mom was in the water. A little hero saved his mom
Heroes.  All of them.
Proud to say that I was born in Orange, Texas!
She's prolly on dope and crashed because she was high
Seeing stuff like this makes me glad I cnt get my license because I have epilepsy that's so sad
Is there a update on the woman's condition...I would like to know if she is ok
Yes!!! Somebody is in there
Cop acted like he didn't want to get in that water! Why pick the hysterical child up and him telling to save her, but then get to the water and ask twice, "Is there somebody in there?" Of course she is in there! Duh!!!
Umm you can’t park there sweetie
👏👏👏🙏🙏
Oh God, hoping she's okay...
Glad the son knew what going on and went and found help. Hope she's okay and still alive because her son should now be her hero.
Damn almost got me in tears... SMH
Don't move with a sense of urgency or anything like that.
😢❤
Praise God for this man helping this woman and baby thank you sir may God bless you and your family
All non chalant "is the car unlocked., really dude?
🙏🏽😩
Omg poor kid man! That must be super scary especially for a child 😢! He’s so smart and reacted super fast! God bless !❤
Thank you Jesus
Did they save her?
Honestly I would have panicked and jumped in the water to get her myself
I'm glad that her kids are okay and she's okay  😊.
Texas native, I’ve met police in West Orange, good town. Hope the mom was ok, what a brave young man she has as a son.
"Is there someone in there"  no shit Dick Tracey.
And he was in noooooo hurry
Yet u have to fkn video tape this ....with is wrong with humanity.
Lazy as cop. What a wimp
I would've preferred the cop not hesitate the moment he saw the car im the water , especially when the little boy is begging him to save his mom. But at least she was saved ❤
Wow prayers to the young boy this happened the day after what was supposed to be my mamas 51st birthday she passed away in 2019 when she was 45 I was I’ll be 26 Saturday
Un héroe ese niño!!!!
Him calling hello? Is someone in thr is crazy work
For the officers that took action and all that help True heroism to not deny help 💪🦁🔥💯🌟🙏💖
Thanks To The Officer 👮‍♀️
How Terrifying For This Baby 😢😢
But then they call police brutality and end all police depts. So glad this poor child got to get help for his mama. Thank God for police all officers.
Why they give these people a licence, its no joke they should never drive Maybe only smart cars idk....
Man the damn cop was scared to jump in and react that was a civilian that rescued her
الحمد لله انهما بخير لقد حطب الطفل قلبي لم يقو على الكلام شكرا للرجال المنقدين
TF U ASKING IF SHE IN THERE DUH
The boy acted fast and luck to get rescued his mom. It is highly suggested for seizure/ epileptic patients not to drive. 🙏
“Is somebody in there?” He just told you….
❤❤❤❤❤
Dont rush or anything...
MAY GOD BLESS RHEM.🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️AMEN JESUS CHRIS
Did she live?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How does everyone have a cam ?
Can I get a “FUCK THA POLICE” ????? No I didn’t think so. Funny how you lot hate on the cops till you need help.
That cop was like "well let me mosie on over"
Why is bro walking so slow?!? Jump in the fkin water!
The front windshield and back window is the weakest window. The side windows are reinforced.
I hope all is well!!!
Brave kid !
That is the fastest most concern cop in history.
Take your time As
The officer does not seem to bother, may be he thought whoever drowned was black. Very sad!
God is awesome thank you Jesus and Jesus name amen
خدا به داد همه برس
Good job son your mom loves you loadsss for this you did super great
Poor kid, may God bless him and his family
Wesse
Naw hes just saying shes in there for jokes 🙄🙄🙄😡😡😡😡
Omg this was painful to watch
I hope the woman and child are okay!
the boy an that man saved that woman’s life not the police officer he was jus calm thru the whole thing:(
Anybody know if she made it?
Finish the video! Did you save her or not?
😢ojala la mami este buen😭🫂🫂🫂
Ma’am you can’t park there 🤷🏿‍♀️
Never seen a cop move slower in my life. No sense of urgency
😢😢Gaza Kids....
The child jumps right into the water trying to get his mom out while the cop stands on the bank asking... is she in there.... yeah such a hero.
God is good. Thank  God there . good people in this world
Thank goodness there was an Angel around.
That cop did not want to help them at all 😞  and it definitely showed Smfh
All praise be to Allah that he was able to get to her in time
What a asshole He's telling you she's in there and your wasting time
Thank you 😢
🙌🏾🙏🏽🕊🙏🏽🕊🥰🕊🙏🏽🕊🙌🏾
She will never get another license.  That is 😳
Brave kid and brave police officer.
That kid is free from being grounded for life. He already seems well raised anyways. I hope they are both doing ok. Very glad they could all get her in time.
That's scary
That guy had the laziest reaction to an emergency
The kid is the real AMERICAN HERO😢 MANNNN
My aunt had a seizure while driving and went off the road into a frozen river. A few minutes later her kids were on the bus home from school and saw her car partially underwater. They called emergency services and when they got her out of the car she had no pulse and wasn’t breathing. After a lot of work by the EMTs and emergency room medical staff they got her back and she stabilized. Doctors said if she had crashed like that in the summer she probably wouldn’t have survived but because of the cold temperatures her body almost went into a state of hibernation. This is a well known phenomena and it’s why doctors will sometimes say “you’re not dead until you’re warm and dead”.   So glad this boy, the officer, and the Good Samaritan were able to save this woman!
Praise God for that son thank you Jesus for that officer and everyone who helped I pray that she is OK. God bless that son that loved his mother.👍👍👍👆🙏🙏✝️✡️📖💖🇺🇸
That took forever 😢
Cop a bit too calm there at first.  Questions, questions..." is car unlocked?"   Bruh, kick it into high gear my guy
That poor baby
Ngl the cop is kinda sped. Kid clearly said "she sunk she had a seizure" points to car. The arrive at the car and this sped ass cop asks if someone's inside🤦🏽‍♂️
Prayers for the officer and the women.
Dumbass tried the door? The water wouldve put enough pressure to seal it. Break a damn window 💀
Thanks for saving this lady. X
Did she make it!?!
Parabéns pr estes anjos  que Deus abençoe sempre vcs 🙏🙏🙏🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🙏🙏🙏
Why he asking ten times when he already stated that his mom is in the car
to all those saying the cop saved the woman i just wanna tell you that woman is not saved yet just because shes out of the water. If you pull someone out of water and their unresponsive always check whether their still breathing and if not do 5 initial ventilations and then if their still not breathing perform cpr. still well reacted from the cop. its just that the woman is not out of danger yet
Cop took his sweet ass time huh? No wonder they edited a lot out of this video just to make him look like a hero lol
That little boy loves his mommy.
😮
God bless those ppl and the police officer
💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
That cop wasn't in no hurry😢😢😢😢That Lil boy crying for his mom broke my heart
Praise Jesus Christ ❤
How about moving your ass a little faster there officer. Holy shit.
Could you be any slower and stupid? Cop needs a different job....
Felicitaciones a alguien que le importa mas grabar para despues subirlo a las redes que salvar a alguien? Eso es no tener ma dre, que heroe ni que la fregada, gente como esa no merece aplausos
Poor kid! I hope they’re all safe and sound today
They saved her!!!!❤❤❤❤
No he's jus crying for no reason...
God bless these Good Samaritans.🙏🏽
Total discrace as a cop. Quit asking and listen
❤God Bless that child.
Well there goes her license for like... a year or 2. That is so incredibly unfortunate. At least they were able to save her! Seizures are so scary. I can't imagine how much it has to suck being in the position she's in. There's nothing like losing your sense of independence from health factors
BRAVE boy! He went to the water too
Pobre criatura!!! Ay Dios mío
Good Samaritan?  That's his job.  Samaritans don't get paid.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮😮😮
This kid knew the assignment and acted.
How could he be so sloww...the cop I mean
Prayers going up in Jesus Christ precious name Amen 🙏 Lord Father God we praise you and bless your holy name your love endureth forever
GOD was definitely with them. What timing it was that the cop was driving up the road. To the lil man, YOU WERE AWESOME kiddo...
Poor kids mom I hope didn’t drown
What a traumatizing experience for that little boy he saved her life he is the true hero ❤hurt my heart to hear him yell help her meanwhile the officer moving slow probably because he can’t swim😂❤ he is still a hero to
May God heals you oh woman. Daughter of the most High! Jesus Christ heals you wherever you are by his stripes you have made whole!
Of course these types are in a dodge charger…
Se debe romper el parabrisas trasero, no los laterales, porque se hunde mas rapido
Good cop??? The little boy did more then the officer. That's the officers fucking job too.
Does anyone know how the mama is doing?
Sorry but that cop has absolutely no interest in saving that person can tell with his extremely slow response and interest to the majority incident
Orange Texas😳 he jumped in water that possibly has gators
🤦‍♂️yeah take your time no rush
Gracias Dios por ayudar a esta madre  por sufrir un ataque, con  sus hijos en el  carro Dios lo siga llenando de bendiciones 😮
Why is the cop getting credit
The one who saved the lady first was the lil boy.. giving directions and location...was he saying my mum? Wow...❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉... Cops and the boy bravos....you are heros❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
💔😢
Por que não tentaram pelo porta malas? Why didn't they try to open the trunk of the car?
Blessings to the boy his mom and the cop who did the rescue at the boys cries for desperate help. Thank God for the boys quick actions🙏🏻
Dude took forever at 1st glance
The little boy crying just broke my heart 💔  I hope his mommy is ok. Did they save her life?
Usual suspects
Poor lil mans man 😢
Terrible cop doesn’t rush in immediately what a moron
God bless the family. I pray everything is okay. ❤
Not a Good Samaritan, that's a cop doing their job. Remember that, it's their job to protect and serve.
The cop was procrastinating installing…. Thank goodness other people was there that actually save this woman’s life.
Did she survive?
Is the car unlocked? Who would remember that in this situation, much less a child.
Its the dodge
Oh my god I think that was her arm
Hope she was okay, thanks for saving her and helping. Poor boy, so sad 😭
😢😢❤❤❤❤❤
The police took too long.
Oh Lord
But yet you defend them it makes no sense
❤❤❤
Why are yall saying he acted fast he literally took forever to jump in asking if she was in there while standing there like no one was in that car that cop needs a better reaction time
Wow...Qué momento ! GRACIAS DIOS MÍO POR TU BONDAD INFINITA DE PONER A TUS ÁNGELES  EN LA VIDA DE ESTAS PERSONAS! GRACIAS !!!!!❤🙏🏻
"Is somebody in there" x2 smh🤦‍♂️like is you dumb?
that cop sucks
Oh my goodness, Gid bless her soul
God be with them all.
This is why my wife do not drive anymore
❤❤❤hope all is well…
Poor boy 😢😢😢 they got her though she needs a siezure dog
Jesus fuck he said someone was in the car why the hell did he wait around and ask him 3 goddamn times.
The panic in that young mans voice sent shivers down my spine. I sure hope everyone is okay.
Another L for the "we don't need men, they're useless and only hurt women" doctrine.
Se logro salvar ?

Dude sure was taking his sweet time… wtf!!!
He waited to long, yeah he saved her but why the fuck do you have to ask if somones in their after the first kid came crying, a child wouldent lie while crying like that unless they were coached
He didnt wanna go in there
That cop asking dumb questions when every second matters was annoying…or is it just me?
Could he move any slower?
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Wasting precious time
She is having a seizure, she sunk! Well- little girl let me take my time to get there  Glad she is ok
The kid clearly said my mom’s in the car and he just continued to ask is somebody in there. Like No shot man I don’t think that kid would be crying for nothing.
God bless this poor child and his mother 💔💔💔😭😭😭
That cop did shit
Liam from Shameless???
Cop was slow as shit wow
Is she there wtf did he just say
Is the car unlocked??? Hello, what an idiot. Save the poor woman.
Little Liam from shameless
Does the cop still get kudos since he's a evil "white man"?
The boy cries desperately for his mommy but, was he saved himself? God bless him for being brave 😢
I wanted to cry just hearing the desperation and distress the child is in
Didn't the kid just said my mom is in the car! WTH is he asking again for! Help her!
My heart 😢 this poor child, I pray she is okay
Kudos to the cops n her son... She's saved. Gr8 Job🎉 Blessings✨
Im amazed at all the horrible comments here...I telling yall that having a seizure in the water can be deadly...i remember it happened to someone before and died ...that little boy had every right to be in panic mode.   I hope his mother lived..what if it was you or your loved ones
The kid and the bystander are the heros. The kid got help the bystander got the lady out on his own.
What a nightmare for that scared young lad. He did well to get help and rescue for his mam. He saved her life.
That baby boy. My heart. I felt his panic and fear. 😭
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Poor child!😢
Cop took his fucking time didn't he
She still died though
Be the Young Lad and Volunteer Guardian Angel!!!❤❤❤
Thank You Spirit!!! 🙏🏽❤️‍🩹
Thank you Jesus ! 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🏾🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
God sent an angel.  ❤ may blessing be returned back to hime sevenfold.
🙏🙏🙏❤😢😢bless him . What a beautiful boy he is .. i pray he and his family are well after their ordeal
How many times does the kid have to tell dude his mom is in there? Cop doesnt listen for shit
🙌
He takes him to a car in water, crying panicking saying she sunk. Cop asks is there someone in the car....... cmon man wtf
Padre bendito en el nombre de Jesús ayúdalos
Tadinho... 😢
Seeing him react the way he is absolutely breaks my heart, and it made me cry cause he looks almost identical to my son.
And you idiots wanna defund the police another failed policy of the liberal regime, trump 24
Thank you Jesus ❤
“I cry out to God; yes, I shout. Oh, that God would listen to me!” ‭‭Psalms‬ ‭77‬:‭1‬ ‭NLT‬‬  And GOD answered the son’s cry❤
Thank you Lord for saving them all.
Is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? Get your ass in that water and save that black woman.
God bless the boy and the man who saved his mother.
Cop moved way tooooo slow for me
They God she is okay. Lord bless the little boy and the people that saved her
The cop acted like he didn’t want to save her. Good thing they had another person that wanted to help. The cop was acting like he wanted to save her, but that cop didn’t give a damn. He was giving such a poor effort
Lord have mercy😢
he's a star man 👨‍🎤
Why was he walking so slow…?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😇😇😇
That's got to be theee absolutely dumbest officer🙄🤦
Quien rescata a alguien filmando ??
Poor kid
I feel everything…😭
My boy was sweating bullets while soaked. You can see the fear
Glorifico a Deus por estar ali por usar o anjinho por enviar-nos obrigado a todos Deus abençoe vcs poderosamente com toda sorte de bênçãos
That boy is all heart. The kind of heart you can't learn, you're simply born with it
🐊
Aww😢this made me so emotional...what a brave young man ❤
Do I dare ask how the mom even ended up in a damn lake, or...
I know you gotta stay calm but damn a little urgency wouldn't hurt. Is someone in there? Like the kid didnt run up saying his mom having a seizure and drowning lol he still asks "is someone in there"?
No child should ever have to be that terrified but he did a great job,  This rescue just had my heart breaking. Thank God they got her put,and that's to the man that helped.
God bless them all for helping
The cop asking if someone was in there with the car under water like Ariel was going to come up and be like yes. Could've been the second between his mother dying and surviving tf. Stupid af
Bravo my boi Bravo to the child and especially the officer that's what to serve and protect means
Blessings on the child & officer...
This Is how our country should always be!!!! Salute too the young man and men who saved this woman.
Aww poor baby😢😢🙏🏾🙏🏾
“IS sOmeBodY iN tHEre”? *casually walks over while kid is crying for help* Jfc dumb ass
That baby crying for someone to help his Mom, gave me chills. God bless his sweet heart.
I’m grateful that this woman was able to be saved…this child would’ve suffered from irreparable trauma and guilt for the rest of his life! I’m grateful that the cops decided to be selfless and save both the child and his mother! 💯💯🙏🏼
That poor baby I pray that they are okay
Thank God there are still decent n caring people in this 🌎. There is still Hope. Praise God. 🙏🏽🙏🏾🙏🏽 for all involved especially the mother.💝💝💝
The cop was annoying and slow
🙏🏾
❤❤❤
Thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah
My dad had a seizure while driving, wasn’t in the car but prob one of the most traumatic days of my life pops doin good now but he hasn’t drove since 2013-14
Thank you God, in Jesus name ❤
“Is somebody in there?” As the drivers side is under water AFTER the kid says “she’s under water”. 🤦🏻‍♀️
What’s with the cop taking his sweet time? He is asking “is somebody in there?” Is the car unlocked? wtf
❤❤❤😢😢😢🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Policial fraco chegar quebrando vídeo meio suspeito
God bless this young hero and his momma. I hope they are safe and sound and dry today.
That child  Why the cop procrastinating
More content where we are helping each other ! Is what the world needs 💖 I pray she made it ! God bless those cops ‼️
If he said it believe HIM 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Help Her !!
😢😢😢❤❤
He going to ask if somebody's in there😂😂 ... Bro?!?
My momma had seizures my whole young life god bless this young man and his family
OMG!!!😢
Se salvo o no la señora?
Did she survive??????
My heart breaks for that little boy❤ He is a Hero❤
Fuck the first guy acting all calm and shit, "is someone in there?" Like the person drowning is gonna say uea I can't breathe I'm drowning...
Jesus  Jesus
Y me preguntó porque el carro ahí en el agua.
Does anyone know if she made it?😢
Cop took 14 business days to open the car like hurry up
Poor kid it's so scared
Omg that poor child😢
Thank you officers !
Não entendi foi nada nesse vídeo 🙄
Asking questions like is the car unlocked...stfu and do your job get in and find out
Great job kid! Smart thinking to get help fast! God bless you all and definitely the Good Samaritan.
Siempre sus mugres videos incompletos sin enlace para ver la segunda parte 🙄
Giving the kid all credit about saving his mom, what about the cop and the other person who did the actual life saving work? Give credit where credit is also due people.
Huh but this won't be all over the news will it I wonder y
Praying for mom and the children 🙏 😢.
Su desesperación 😢😢😢😢Pobrecito 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
Oh. . . My. . . Good Lord I can't breathe!! Just... 😮WOW...😢 That little boy did what most kids couldn't... Thank God he didn't freeze in panic!
Blessings to the child and the police officers🙏🙏
He was a man that day.. to the best of his ability performed under pressure.. I hope the best to them.
Yo solo espero que estén todos bien 😢😢😢😢😢🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
🙏🏽😇
Asking is somebody inthere is insane,just junp in hero,i would have said nothing,just got wet
Wow , das sind echte Retter❤️❤️❤️❤️
Did she live?
I can’t even see imagine the boys panic
And How is it dramatic? The child is afraid for his mom??
Is someone in there 👀 depressed 😔 really...kid said it's his mom😢crazy it slow motion
🇮🇷🇮🇷😔😔🤲May God help you. Thank you very much for your help. The family was not hurt while in the car. I hope everyone returns home safe and sound. Thank you. Always remember God.
Meu Deus protege livra de todo mal
❤❤
What a brave young man
That cop was moving so slow. And asking dumba$$ questions. Almost like he didn't care if the woman died....
Why am I not surprised at all that it was a charger. Why do people who can't drive constantly wind up in these chargers.
Big ups to the police officer who listened and acted immediately ❤
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
God bless you man 😢
🤲🤲🤲🤲🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I swear people get dumber and dumber. A boy crying telling you his mom is having a Siezure and is stuck in the car and water. You proceed to ask is someone in there.... Like bruh wtf do you think you are here for.
The cop was not on his rescue instinct, the boy already told you his mom had a seizure and she went under water , why the hell are you asking is yhere someone down there as if the mom is going to come up and say yeah its me down here drowning!!!!
Ok you all gotta watch the other video where they were saying the Cop saved!
그 아이의 엄마가 무사하길 바랍니다
He said she was in there on the street!!!, then you asking again?? while hes out in the water??
Yeah the police took to long
The fact that the kid already told him like 3 times his mom was in the water and the cop is still like is someone in there ?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not like the cops taking their sweet ass time to get somebody out of a car
Good Samaritan? He has a duty
Is anyone under there we know you maybe having a seizure and can't respond but are you under there. The level of emergency service usefulness.😂
Not a “Good Samaritan”, that’s literally his fucking job
His crys immediately made me cry.
Con esa pinche calma crees que la quiere salvar? Para el mejor si se ahoga, es negra! Le vale! Le entró para no verse mal porque ya andaba un paisa tratando de sacarla.
Did she make it
When God wants you to grow up, He will break you first😢  -The good Samaritan
If you're medically diagnosed with seizures and you drive and happen to crash. You should legally be obligated to assume all responsibility.  Don't drive if you've got serious medical conditions, especially with your child in the car. Thank God that boy and his momma are alright- may it be a lesson she learns from.
This.  Mother should be appreciative. Not just for her son, but this man, who is also a hero for saving her life.
Poor baby 😢❤ the pain I his voice.
The desperation in this little angels voice 😢😢😢😢😢
She either got very lucky or it was divine intervention?  Either way most people that find themselves in that situation don’t live to tell about it
😢😢😢😢💔
I can't imagine how long he ran looking for help😢😢
💪💪💯💯🙏💜
Didnt he just say that his momma was in the car
I hate when we don't know what happened.
El niño hosterico por su madre el policia preguntando si hay alguien😮
I just wanted to hug that little boy so bad. 😰
Oh my God this is so heartbreaking even just reading the comments made me break down that little boy reminds me so much of someone I know maybe that's why I touched my heart like it did I hope she's okay
He said she having a seizure. ..he even knew how they flipped over
The mother was still in intensive care per the last update. 12 year old son and his 16 year old sister were also in the car.
Why this didn’t make shaderoom? lol it’s some good ppl out here !💙
Wym good samaritan cop? Isnt this his job?
So sad . and it’s crazy how more and more people who suffer from epilepsy are behind the wheel and either crashing or going into water while having a seizure . Not saying you shouldn’t be able to drive but after a certain amount of seizures you shouldn’t be allowed to drive for safety measures . I rather tell a person they’re not allowed to drive than this …. My heart 😢❤
My son has Epilepsy and this is my worst fear. 😢
I say the cop did his job but was stupid you see a kid on Side of road with no adult and car in the water what do you think I would know there was someone in the car
Omg omg omg
La madre se salvó?
🥺💔The feeling that the child has when asking for help for his mother is the same feeling as a mother asking for help for one of her children🤰🏻🤱🏻👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
How did the child get out? Tge doors are shut!!
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Dios mío que pena espero que esté bien
Dude why all the questions....Just hurry up and Get in there Deng🙄🙄🙄
Great lil man he loves his momma! I know my boys would do the same fulfills my heart ❤️
Poor baby.
El niño esta muy asustado, pero salvo a su mama.
No child should ever be that afraid.Never!
الطفل يقول امي انقذها والرحْمه ذا يقول هل فيه احد هنا !!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂 الاجانب تموت من غبائهم
Somebody there can you hear me
If she was having a seizure like the son said, she likely passed. Very sad
That’s kind of situation break my heart 🥹
What do you mean!?!? The cop was no good. He shouted at the car to see if the woman having a seizure would answer (!?!?), he walked calmly into the water, and he repeatedly tried to open the locked door? He wasn’t even trying. The other guy saved her
Whatever you do... don't get in a hurry
She's alive???
What a dumb cop. ACAB. He would have checked to see if the car was locked if that kid was white.
Kids telling the guy his mom is dying in the sinking car and he wasted time yelling "Is somebody in there?!". Doesn't matter to me that he did his job by saving her, his racist mind still jeopardized her life by being scared it was some sort of trap. Luckily she was strong and that wasted time wasn't just enough time to be the end of her.
❤thank God he was able to get help and bless the men who saved her.
She keeping the female driver cliche alive and strong 😆
God Thank you for that Police officer
Bless God
Thank you officer
That poor baby boy. My ❤ just goes out to him.    God bless the Good Samaritan who helped them and the wonderful officer.
Did she survive?😮
Ho-Lee Shit....😮
Bless this child and his Mom.....Father God !
The dumbass cop asking "iS Somebody i there ?" 🤡
Bless him Lord! I hope she made it.
How can you talk to someone under water.
How did he even get out of the car in the first place!  Such a brave kid! I'm crying 😢
Thank God she is ok now ! Thank you lord for your mercy!
Wow....thank God and the Gentleman.  Bless the young child and mother....
😂😂😂
tnx a lot 4 saving her life almighty God we continue to protect you and ur household
Texting and driving into the water
UPDATED UPDATE
Pobrecito,ojala no les haya pasado nada grave!!! Gracias por ayudarlo!!!
You can hear him say “ouch my foot” so I think he hurt
is the car unlocked?
🙏❤️
She has seizures but drives? Omg
The son needs credit for saving his mother too! Poor baby
This is why I don't drive because I have seizures too
The kid was desperate but did it and got his mom rescued good job kido
Looks like she took the wrong turn…….
Im glad she is safe and the child can be relieved but I'm starting to see a trend about people crashing out into bodies of water. What can we do to fix that?
God bless each of you actung fast on this woman life . To God be the glory for good peoples in this world . God bless her to a speedy recovery 🙏😢in jesus name i ask thi prayer Amen 🙏 ❤
That cop didn't do anything.  He didn't give a 💩
That kid was COMPOSED.
God Bless all those is law enforcement!🙏🙏
Gazzede  9 aydir bundan bin kat kotu manzaralar var ve onlarinda ailelerinde bu durumda hic bir suçları yok
This cop was useless
E notícia da mãe dele.   ?????
Why the cops move so slow...
My company experienced this but with a BFV rollover in 2019 at Ft. Stewart (R.I.P lads you are never forgotten), she's lucky, and so is the kid.
Where is the sense of urgency. I've came across several car wrecks where people's life were in jeopardy. I took it a lot more serious than this cop.
Did she survive?
Lil child crying "please save my mom"  Cop: easy boy 🗿 she has some time, chill
Impactante  😮  me alegra  que se salvo  su mama ❤ que todo  fue  bien por el niño y por ella .❤️
Not a good samaritan, doing his job to protect and serve.
Does anybody know what happened to her and her son ? 😢
The biggest question is.. How in the exact fuck did she end up there ☠️🙏
I’m sorry but if you know you’re bound to seizures/epileptic episodes. Stay off the road. Not only did she put her and her kids life in danger, but other drivers too
I wonder why it's called good Samaritan and not good Palestinian.. oh right. Samaria.
Jesus🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
“Stuck in the water!!” “Is she there?” …no. Shes outside. OBVIOUSLY
Сподіваюсь його мама вижила🙏🏼
Damn, the cop was almost useless. I could hear in his voice he wasn't gonna run a mile. I'm a convict, white, southern and Biker. Three times as fast I'd already broken my hand on the glass getting that woman out. Shameful.
Poor baby❤ praying for their family
صرخات الولد بكتني 😢 ياعمري خايف على امه ❤
Poor kid
The cop trying not to get his socks wet. Who noticed
Why tf are you asking is somebody in there when the boy already told you it is ?????
Wow! unbelievable. Thank you all for her rescue! Hugs to her boy! Brave!
"Is she in there" no shit
In another argument,They say women don’t need men! 🙄
Blessings to those men that potentially risked their safety to save that women
Him asking if someone’s In the car  multiple times is stupid.  Did he not hear that little boys desperate cry 🤦🏽‍♂️
Breaking the windows makes the car sink faster. Damn idiots.
Great job lil man. You saved moms life!!!
He looked all wet as if he was in the car!! so how did he get out?
Defend not Defund the police and this is why....we need them.....what is this country going to do if there are no police and you are in trouble
Thank God for your overcoming fear to save your mo Thank God for the Police Officers that help ed and help us all
The cop literally did nothing.
Knock knock who’s there? A woman drowning like WTF
🙏🙏🙏
poor hell cat
Took him long enough the he say is somebody in there duh he jus said she in the water smh
Cop acted like he really didn't want to get in that wated 😒
- Is somebody in there? - Glu, glu, Glu, Glu !
Piece of shit cop showed no urgency at all
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😮😮
That kid just witnessed his mother have a seizure and drive her car into a lake. Then while she was most likely drowning he found the courage and mental clarity to run AWAY from her so that he could get help and save her life. That's fucking incredible, that little man is a hero.
That cop is very slow!
Did these people live God 🙏
God 🙏 🤲 🕍
One word-crocodile
Glory glory.Gids miracle. Thank you sir and thank you God ,🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
Hell Yeah
God bless you sir God bless you
Crying on the toilet . Good lord kid ur the man.
This young kid is a badass...as are the Officer and the Good Samaritan who didn't think twice before jumping in to extricate that woman. Kudos to all 3 heroes!
Женщина выжила? Господи спаси и сохрани всех мам и детей
The child helped save his mama’s life.
Seeing this boy knows what a seizure is I assume he has seen this before most likely from his mom having them. The government needs to not let people prone to things like these drive. It will save lives
Is somebody in there? lol
Yeah "seizure"
The cop truly didn't wanna get wet xd
No hicieron nada... Se demoraron filmando.
عليك انقاذه ودع التصوير
Very brave young man. Not only did he escape the car but he gave clear details of the incident so that he could save his mother but he did it in a situation where many would have panicked. God bless him
The kid said his mom was in there...and the officer still asked "who's in there"....🤦🏽‍♂️ lots of I.q. points in law enforcement
Aww glad she was rescued! I know that was so scary !
Dios lo bendijo para darle fuerzas y q salieran con vida , 😢no puede ni hablar, se me fue el aliento
>kid clearly stressed and trying get help >officer sees sinking car "iS sOmEoNe iN tHeRe??" 🤦
Okay, maybe ACAB but one.
Cop was slow. Help, not ask so many questions
@fayemcarthur4609 How do you know anything about this were you there?
We need to do something about those who suffer from seizures that operate motor vehicles. Had a friend whose girlfriend suffered from one while behind the wheel. Hurt herself badly, while also damaging a few vehicles. Gotta be a better way to keep them, and others, safe. Come on big pharma!!! Need you to step up… is there not enough money in it for you?
😢😢😢
That cop didn't seem to be in too much of a hurry. Just saying.
Aweeee that poor boy. I hope his mom was okay
Poor child 😢😢😢😢😢
Y la madre quedó con vida ?
Cop doing the bare minimum here.
👦 : she is drowning  👮‍♀️: ok hop in , is she in there , is somebody in there. 💀; bro just go save her
This cop is pissing me off. "Is the door unlocked" go find the fuck out the 8 yr old distraught child will not help you. Jfc. He asks to many stupid questions. Wastes a full minute asking if anyone is in there when the bpy yelled his mum was in their in the first few seconds of this clip. If you're that bad in a stressful situation dont be a fucking cop.
مثل کودکان غزه
Oh my how is she??? How is the little boy???😢😢😢😢
The boy just told you his Mom was in there. Why are you asking,is somebody in here? Stupid question! She can't answer you man.
I got chills 😢
Good thing they didn't defund the police😮
This little hero has me crying. Way to go little Man and thanks TO THE MAN THAT JUMPED IN TO HELP.
Lazy fucking cop just standing there
Poor kid knows it's life or death. Cop's like "do I have to get wet?" Surprised he didn't give up with locked door or understanding the weight of water on in. "Tell EMS to step it up, they save lives, not us." Imo & ImExperience.
He sure took his dam time
Gotta be the slowest situation awareness and reaction time I have ever seen 😂
Ė chocante o desespero do menino 😢, tomara que tenham conseguido salvar a mãe dele ❤
I can feel that kids fear in his voice the thought of this happening is so scary.
You can't park there!😮
Is this cop serious there’s no way he’s serious
Is somebody in there?! MY MOMMA! is the car unlocked? Ffs help her!
Thank  lord jesus for this man help
So stupid asking questions instead of acting
O q tão  esperando
Dramitac rescue" this is not dramatic this is saving a life of his mom
Porque nao colocam o engate no carro na agua e puxa meu Deus
Neither CNN nor MSNBC would ever show this. This video doesn't support their political goals.
Se salvó  su madre?
Dudes so worried about getting wet that he had to make sure someone was in there before he.. "RISKED IT ALL".......
😢😢😢😢
DO NOT HOP IN OMG
Grazie,grazie,grazie,❣️
Wow! That poor boy, God Bless you 🙏 ❤️
😢😢😢 THANK YOU FOR HELPING !!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Did she live
So is mommy ok? 😢
Que du bonheur pour cet enfant ?  Il vient de sauver sa maman 🤲💃
We’re they both ok in the end. That was heart breaking to see
😢😢🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Hope his fear is relieved by her rescue.😢
His pleas for help for mommy is breaking my ❤( got me crying also)
True heroes
The back window is always the place to get out the back is lightest and will float the longest less water will get in when you brake it or kick it out
Thank you God❤
Hope she was saved!
🥺
Adult: "Is someone in there"  Kid: pulling at the drivers door shouting for his mom.   No, no one is in there.............
The cops response was so slow smh
Is black take your distance go for some donut or something more interesting
God saved that family. That little boy was so brave he had on the armor of our lord. I hope the mother was saved and all that were helping have a blessed life
My wife suffers with sezuires, the only reason I drive is for her to
pauvre petit garçon il s'en souviendra toute sa vie
May God bless him all of them
Ay polecia tan pendejo orita teban a contestar,,siiiii!!!!! Acá estoyyyy!!!! Diossss mio ,tu ayuda y punto.
Let’s not give that cop too much credit now
God bless that man for saving that child mom.God Bless you.❤
Brave little man. Your. Mom must be so proud.  And a cop who gets right on and does it. Far too many police in the uk ( not all but too many) are so health and safety conscious they'd stand on the  bank hand wringing while waiting for the fire brigade....
Lâche ton portable et sauve la vraiment 😢
What the hell is a good samaritan Cop? There job is to assist. Then yall wonder why people don't rely on cops for nothing!!
I guess this is no time to be talking about women drivers.
Mały bohater sprowadził pomóc dla mamy mimo szoku w jakim był brawo
Why tf was that cop hesitating to go get her, the child had to get in before doing anything🤦‍♀️
Heroes
Oh that's poor child... So scary
GOD BLESS THE CHILD AND THE COP ALL WHO HELPING WITH THEM. PRAISE GOD HALLELUJAH
Why does he have to ask if she is in there?
Jesus Christ
Thank You God Bless You!!🙏🙏✨️✨️♥️♥️
Poor kid! ❤
Wtaf that cop seemed to relaxed for someone to be in that situation??!
Why the cop ask annoying question i was like hurry up bro stop wasting time she is dying
I wish the cop got in the water sooner but I’m glad he did & I thought they had something on them to break windows; also, I’d like to know how did things turn out my prayers for the kid and their Mother❣️🙏🏻
My mother had seizures when she was alive. One day, she literally had a seizure while she was driving the car with me and my brother. I was in the front seat and my brother was in the back seat. Me and him had to work together to save her, and ourselves. I took my mom’s foot off the gas with my hands and reached down past her legs to control the pedals and push the breaks, and my brother stirred the wheel from the backseat into a parking lot. We parked the car, called for help, and waited until the seizure subsided. It still amazes me at how calm we were and how quickly we took action at such young ages. My brother was about 14 and I was about 11-12 at the time. RIP momma 🌹
That poor sweet boy, thank God for this officer and the man who stopped to help
That cop had no sense of urgency and didn't give af
😢😢😢😢 graças a Deus conseguiram salvar a mãe dele.
😱🙏❤️🥰
Espero que todo haya salido bien qué hay rescatado con vida los que están dentro del vehículo
Poor kid.
10 minutes of desperate cries in the cop ask is somebody in the car...
Quiero saber si lograron salvarla por favor.
😇Thank you Thank you Bless you
The government worker didn't save her. We the people did .
Good Samaritan? He’s a cop it’s his job not to mention he had zero sense of urgency and wasn’t even the one to get her out.
God bless...xxx
Love lil boy u save your mother life .  Prayers to him and her
Imagine that guy helping somebody with all his racism he has in his heart
God bless
The trunk numb nuts
that kids a G
Why do these people who have seizures drive they should be banned from driving
in Florida, you need to think it more than 2 times... water = __________
The guy yelling for somone in a submerged car instead of just checking frustrated me.
THIS 👮 IS TRASH, WITH NO SENSE OF URGENCY FOR  THAT CHILD, AND THEN ASKING DUMB ASS QUESTIONS. SO GLAD FOR THE GOOD SAMARITAN THAT WAS ON SITE
Just because its in the description doesn’t make it true, watch the video kudos to that great samaritan 👏🏾
I pray she's ok.
Poor baby! I hope that momma survived.
I bet that water’s cold af, mom’s on her own. I ain’t getting my pants wet.
I dont understand how stupid the cop is to ask agian if someone was in there if the kid already said my moms in the car from the jump 😐
So sad.
Thank u Jesus ❤
That’s a brave kid, saving his Mama’s life.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Well well well... praise the cop for his live saving act and the kid for reaching out for help
His cries broke my ❤
Poor baby he’s desperation broke my heart!😭. I love how the police officer stood to help him! I Hope the mother is well!!!  May our heavenly father bless you all!🙏🏼❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Por favor nao percam tempo gravando , salvem , o importante e ficar na memoria de vcs.
"Cop is moving so slow 🤦‍♂️" Thats what I was thinking!!!
How slowly and disinterestedly he attends to this emergency, all because it is of color  Why if they were white to the touch oh if they are running no racists
Bebecito hermoso ❤ tu corazoncito late de desesperación e inocencia para rescatar a tu madre
Как же туда попали?
The cop sounded like, if his bodycam wasn't on, he REALLY wouldn't have given a dam about that child and anyone else who needed help. As a matter of fact, the SON OF A REEEEAL BISH sounded like he was actually ANNOYED that he had to be there in the first place. 😒
Oh my goodness Lord thank you 🙏🏿❤️
Q lindo demais
Slow to react
That's a police officer ❤
Me dolió ver la angustia de ese niño  porq salvarán a su madre, espero q se recupere y q todos estén juntos y felices ❤
Fuuuuuck bro ...... Wtf
"Is someone in there?"  wtf...What do you think?
Is somebody in there after he just said what he said
DÍGANME PLISSS QUE ESTÁN BIEN😮
I hope they saved her
Gracias a Dios  justo a tiempo,  salvaron a su madre 🙏
DIOSTODOPODEROSO LOS AYUDE Y FORTALESCA AL NIÑO. AMEN AMEN AMEN
Having a kid clearly traumatized telling you his mom is in there, and then slowly walking towards the car asking is somebody in there 😂 yeah wtf do you think
That’s a recovery…🙏🏾
Cop took his time getting her out
That cop didn't give a shit
😭😭😭😭😭
Wow.  This is what changes lives forever.  These officers are so overlooked by the ones that stand in the opposite direction.  Talk about demons and angels. This officer is clearly an Angel that was sent to save.  He did just that.     I thank him.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Looks like the officer had some typebof Video Camera...BOY SAID HIS MAMA HAD A SEIZURE.....IF YOU KNOW THATVYOUHAVE ANY TYPE OF MEDICAL CONDITION THAT COULD THREATING YOURBLIFE WHILE DRIVIG OR ITHERS, YOU SHOULD STOO DRIVING FIR GOIDNESS SAKE !! ,  PLEASE ;
I see my algorithm wants me to cry today
Who still wants to defund the police!
So proud of that young man staying calm and getting help for his mom. I was a little confused why the police officer was screaming is anyone in there when the boy already said she’s having a seizure and she sunk but I’m glad someone else was around to help the police himself, and work with the gentleman who pulled her from the car as best he could to save this boy’s mother. This was a sad occurrence, but proud of that young man and the man who actually jumped into save her.
The love of people makes the world 🌎🌍🌍 go around in around well done truly amazing when love is first 🥇🥇🥇 in Jesus Christ Name
I’m so mad a person that has seizures regularly would thinks it’s ok to drive at all wtf is wrong with that. Not ok shitty parenting , now you got a traumatized kid that will never trust you behind the wheel because your lack of sense 🤯
That kid😢😢😢😢😢😢
The cop is really stupid. He was asking if someone is there whereas the child is begging to have his mom saved.
What you mean if someone is in there ? Oh the kid was just joking! Dump ass cop run! What not on the hurry, Ohh i see is not the same kind!!
Blessed be to that family and that officer
Breaks my heart for the young man to have to go through that. 🙏 for his family
Wtf was that cop tapping on the car window? Zero effort to actually break the glass
Parabéns aos envolvidos... até o celular foi herói nessa hora (filmou debaixo d'água).
His good man
That s the slowest rescue ever!!! It s not like the mother  needed urgent help...
🙏🏾🙏🏾😢😢
Grande el rescatista. Bendiciones y pronta recuperación para la señora
Brave young Man ❤we are so proud of you baby boy
Y por qué diablos se dieron esas circunstancias ?  Esta señora estaba conduciendo.....¿ en que estado ?    El niño muy valiente, pero es lo normal.  Todos actuamos en esos casos  por el instinto de salvación.  Pero , ¿ se pudo evitar este extremo?
Ooh dear Lord,you are a champ and hope you got over that trauma
Cop didnt do shit lmao
Cop had the slowest reaction time ever
Good that he helped the kid even tho he was bla- my lawyer advised me not to finish the joke
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Kids like Yo cop. Stop being fat and do something!. This is exactly why exercise is important kids.
That cop wasn’t in any particular hurry
But we won't televise the white cop helping. That's not the narrative.
لا حول ولاقوة الابالله العلي العظيم واتوب إليه
that cop did not seem to hurry much 🙄
THE POLICE SAVED HER!!!!! Let’s not forget that part!!! She have an amazing son, who climbed out, and did everything he could, to save his Momma!!!! The cops held her in his arms and carried her out through the water! HE RISKED HIS OWN LIFE!!!  💙👏💪
The kid 😣💔 so little so desperate 😖
Salvou?
The coo was moving too slow for me
Did she survive?
Stupid cop is so slow with the rescue hopefully she is okay from his stupid negligence. I mean he still  got her out the car i commend him for that but being so slow made me feel like he didnt care so much
defo hero cop, yeh black life's matter
Сын настоящий герой ❤❤❤
Mom should have paid more attention to the road
By Gods Grace
I dont wanna bash him but the first bodycam is moving like hes... I dont even know just way too slow
His first response is to get help even though he’s scared.
I'm so glad the officer was prejudice and had a will to want to help a Black family. Yall know these Wyte officers act like helping black people is a crime. You can tell in his voice he is one of those officers that's helping to protect and serve. May GOD Bless him and this family. Thank GOD She Survived! I hope she didn't know she have Seizures because people who do know they have Seizures DO NOT SUPPOSE TO BE DRIVING Because something like this can happen.
🥺🥺❤️
Just tell the door, fbi open up😂
Grasias por decir k estan bien.😅❤❤❤❤❤
Just like a cop. stand on the side and ask stupid questions before going to look. what a dumb a**.
You got be flying to endup in the water
some good men right there hope the little man’s mom is okay her boy saved her
Little boy runs up crying, soak and wet.  Cop: Is somebody in there??????   Dude acted like he didn't want to get wet!!!!!
He got out the car n out the water he a very brave young boy 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😊😊
My heart broke for the child … 😢 so traumatizing. I hope mum is doing well !
Thanks God somebody help them! Blessings!
Pobre niño, que impresión
It takes 110 seconds to drown. Next time you dive Cowboy ! 🔰🌺 LPN
And half y’all want to say fuck the police until you need them to help like this
“IS sOmEboDy iN tHerE” BIH DUH‼️
Such a brave young boy, may God protect you and help you 😢
This has got to be the most terrifying video I’ve ever seen!
Poor baby, he is so scared. I read somewhere else that his mom was ok and recovering in the hospital.
🙏❤
Good thing that cop quadruple checked to make sure there was somebody in that car!!
😢
Thanks officer for saving her life
Meu Deus o o desespero dessa criança, pra salvar a sua mãe, obrigado o senhor sempre enviar anjos 🙏🏿🙌🏿🇧🇷🇧🇷
Please Tell me everyone is ok 😢
Imagine that car had been pushed over a bridge guardrail about 40 feet above. It was upside down. All the doors had seized up when crushed as the roof rolled over the guardrail. I was unable to open the doors and no one was in reach when i went as far into the car ss I could includi g the rear seat arra. Another person joined tbe effort and both of us together could not open the crushed doors. He stood on tbe bottom of the car and it was chest deep for him.  It went over in front of me.I was a 15 yr old HS Senior. The cops, fire truck and divers showed up. They ordered us out of the water. The firetruck dragged the car out upside down. The man was on the back window ledge. They took him to a nearby hospital.  I described how it happened to the accident investigator. He did not believe me. I explained it as basic physiics. i insisted I was correct and re-explained how it occurred several times. I later lrarned that later an accident expert from tbis county travelled the country teaching this method of stopping cars as the Pitt Manuever. I finally found two earlier people who used this twchnique. The Romanian Secret Police taught it to their people. And stock car drivers used it in the early 1950's.  So the hidtory of the common police manuever.  I know hhow i feel years later dredging this up. I didn't know the man. Tha child was dealing witj it being his mom. He will always remember that and the gpod resolution. Best wishes.
Dumb cop “is there someone on there?” The little boy was soaking wet when he found ya buddy
Thank God for you
THAT POOR BOY HAD ME CRYING FROM HIS TERROR !!!
pobrecito el niño desesperado
What part of his mom was in there?! 😣
That was a cop who was wasting time asking stupid questions
Bless you Sir ♥️💯
News outlets any time there’s a black person: “GOOD SAMARITAN”
That poor kid! Thank you for saving Mom! ❤️❤️❤️
❤
She can never drive again. Never know if there will be another one. I hope she’s safe and is with her baby.
Lmao if someone wasn’t already trying to save the lady the cop wouldn’t have even believed the kid wtf.  Kid was crying about his ma in the car and he’s just there going “are you Suure there’s someone in the car” lmao
Thank you sir, for your kind deeds. This little YoungBoy was freaking out about his mom.  You’re a wonderful and brave.❤🙏🏾
Amazing action of the boy...his anguish is unbelievable...I hope she was saved. 😢❤❤
I can’t imagine that little boys fear. Thank u for helping him❤
I pray he doesn't suffer from trauma. 🙏
That cop just really annoyed me in the beginning. You can clearly see the terror on this boys face
How's the mom now? Is her boy able to cuddle with her now?
Oh the Trauma this Child has just suffered, Praying that his Mother made it 🙏❤️🙏
Is she okay???
😭😭😭
There is god cos thank God thank you 😢
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Did this officer really yell "is someone in there" after repeatedly being told there is, and seeing the whole cabin submerged in water??
Took so long to help." Excuse me, unconscious person, are you in there?"
Cop is asking if someone in there and the damn kid is crying telling him to help her
Was his Mama saved? I so hope
🕯️🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Oh is she ok
Girl: HELP HER HELP HER! Cop: is somebody in there?
He took to long
❤
Chłopie masz jaja 💪
Waterproof camera...👍🏻
🎉😢 IS SHE OK DOS SHE SRIVIVE OH GOD BLESS WE ARE SO BLESSED … What a nice courageous young man for springing to action and God blessing him the words to get help … god bless these officers that saved this woman life 😇
Crazy how this comment section shows the bigger issue and not calling out the BS. This cops response to this kid is, "Is she in there..is somebody in there?".....Really? How fast you think he'd respond if it were a white kid crying for his mama. A Good cop would've jumped right in that water.
Thank God there are no gators in that water!!
As cruel as the world is this is the algorithm that never gets pushed, Im a black male and I salute the west orange texas police department for their efforts here
How is this a good Samaritan? It’s in his job description.
I’m surprised the body can still worked after getting dunked
How many times did the kid have to TELL HIM SHE WAS IN THE CAR but the cop KEPT ASKING, "IS SHE IN THERE", "IS SOMEBODY IN THERE?"...really??? THE KID WAS SCREAMING FOR HIS LIFE!!!!
That you man is amazing for helping save his mom brought tears to my eyes
We need good people like him God bless him 🙏
Poor sweet child..May the lord be watching over them both🙏🏻💔
Kid says save her... he waste an additional minute asking if someone is in the car. Ugggg good son
Uau
“is anybody In thERe???”  Get tf in the water and help his mom omg
This just shows there are good & decent cops around.  God bless y’all
Best moment, hearing this guy say step it up. Everyone involved is such a hero. Guy never questioned the kid.
Yeah of course it's a hellcat typical
😢😢
All Police, EMS and others have a glass breaker for water emergencies.
🙏🏽💛🙏🏽
God bless that man❤
That cop so useless
The lack of urgency is crazy lol
the cop had no sense of urgency if this poor child was any older like a teen he would have doubted him
What do you mean if she's in there🤔🤫
I'd love to hear about the rest of this story..does anyone know how mom made out after they got her to hospital?
Seeing that little boys desperate cries for help shakes me to the core…😢
I will never forget this young man. My son is epileptic he's 19, always scared when he goes out. God bless them all
That cop didn’t want to get wet. Asking several questions before going in. If a kid is that desperate you don’t hesitate. Move with some enthusiasm.  I understand staying calm but too many first responders walk to a rescue.  Some not all. I have seen both
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
My goodness. Thank you for rescuing her.
Not going to lie the water asmr is so good 😌
The little boy in me felt that your mum is everything.
Why do I feel like this cop didn’t even try and or want to help that woman. Like who pulls up to a car underwater and starts yelling “is she in there? Is the car unlocked?” Like yo get in that water you fucking pussy
Brave kid to run to get help.
He‘s not really a Good Samaritan in the classical sense tho is he? He‘s a cop he‘s doing his job. He‘s a good cop that is what he is
👍👏👏👏👏
So the good samaritan saved the lady give that guy the cops salary
Cop seemed to take his time at the beginning asking if anybody was in there, duh!!!!!!!
The cop didnt want to help how he was suppoed to
Doesn't look like she may have survived
God bless you little  one
This baby was so brave. Thank you for rescuing her. There are some good police officers out there that loves humanity no matter what color your skin is or who you are. Bless these kind of officers. 🙏🏾💜🙏🏾
Women drivers again 😂
Wow, that's a dramatic situation if I ever saw one, especially for the poor kid. He clearly loves his momma! Glad she was rescued! ❤
Si pasa en chile y llaman a carabineros cuando lleguen ya se seco el lago
Blessings 🥰
And THIS is what good cops should be like.
Poor boy omg he better get some time off school and all the time with his Mum he can get for goong through that.
Ce petit garçon m'a déchiré le cœur il a tellement peur de perdre ses parents il est tétanisé, vous monsieur l'agent vous êtes une très bonne personne que dieu vous garde ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🙏🏼❤️❤ God bless you
The boy: she sunk, she is in the water Officer: is somebody in there?  Bruh
Poor baby but so brave. Hope all went well.
Thank you officers for helping his mom.
🌬️🍀💚💫💯🙊🙉🙈
Some body known if she is okey??
“Is somebody in there?” My guy we just frantically drove here bc somebody is.
So can anybody give me an update???? Is ma dukes ok???
ACAB
Santo Dios ¡ Una bendición que el niño encontrará ayuda !
Great rescue 😮😮😮😮😮
I’m sorry there really needed to be more urgency - the kid told you exactly what was going on from the get go
I want the heart and courage of this young man for the rest of humanity.
God bless this family 🙏
God what a beautiful, brave, strong child. Thank you lord for blessing us all with his presence. Hes going to be a good young man
Cop has zero urgency
Dios mío que se encuentre bien 🙏🏼
Why did the cop ask if anyone was in there when the boy was literally SHOUTING that his mom was in there what the actual f. And then you guys have the audacity to call him a “hero cop”??? Give me a break, that lady could’ve died because of how slow that cop was to start doing anything
There should be an emergency breakong System this is so scary
How did the child get out of the car? Doors locked, windows up after?
Is someone in there. Yes dude. Buddy probably walked over there too
I'm glad this young man ran for help, and cudos to the guy already at the car, the cop may have acted too late had someone not already been there.  The scared a** cop asked the kid is the car unlocked, as if he would even remember that in his panic state of mind (about to lose his mom), and then prior to that dumb question, the cop asked if someone was in there, after being told "She's having a seizure, she sunk and is in the water,"  What more information did you need to get moving???????
THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF A TRUE BLUE P.O.S. OFFICER, HOW MANY TIMES DOES THE CHILD HAVE TO TELL THIS WORTHLESS SACK OF SH*T!!!????? WHAT A WAIST OF TAX PAYERS DOLLARS
Слава богу что спасли мальчик большой герой 👏👏💪🏻
Cop looked like he was carrying a child!! Where is mom.
THANK YOU, JESUS❤❤❤❤
Good that she was rescued. But, people that know they may a potential seizure should not drive.  I rescue a woman that had a seizure will she was getting on the freeway.  She crashed into the side rail.  I broke her window to get her door open.  After the seizure stopped, she asked that we not call the ambulance or police.  She knew she could have a seizure at anytime.  Imagine if she made it on the freeway.
Severely bothers me the cop waited for a reply from someone who was allegedly unconscious. Why tf would you wait? She needs help yesterday dawg
He is a Hero.. both of them!! bless them forever!
Did she make it  My goodness
Thank you for carrying officer, you’re one of the good ones. 😊
That kid looks like Liam from shameless
"Tell EMS step it up" tells you everything about how dire the situation is.
Omg 😢! God bless that little boy. I felt his pain in his voice asking g for help for his mom.
Good job guys you'll be rewarded not in this life but this in the afterlife. God is good to those who are NOT SELFISH. 🙏 He also has the neighbor from hell for those who are SELFISH, & GREEDY. 😂
That cop sucks
He just saved, his mama.
He took his time giving the lowliest fuck.
HUGS, big hugs to that Sweet Boy..his fear hurt my heart.
Why tf did he scream at the car is somebody in there w Hen clearly the car is going underwater ? Everyone knows you couldn’t open a car door under water even if it was unlocked 🤦🏽‍♀️Next. Good job
That was the worst cop I’ve ever seen. No urgency whatsoever
After all the stories I read about some cops, I am so happy that there are indeed some good cops❤ Thank you officer ❤❤
La sacaron verdad ?
people w/medical problem such as this this should NOT be driving at all for safety reason!
The cop waited long enough to do somthin lmfao Jesus
Cop proceeds to yell at a sunken car like they’ll be able to answer from in there. That’s cops for ya
My God.
Slowest cop ever
Dios
First cop way too chill
The chances of the cop being there at that time and the boy being able to escape the sinking car is actually crazy, it probably would’ve have ended different if he wasn’t near by
That's his job to help people
Remember the young Native American child Elijah Hadley who was executed and shot 19 times. The news channels are quite about this murder.
That cop didn’t seem to care too much… Hmmm🤔….
That little  boy just made me cry 😢😢 I felt his hurt lord
❤Brawo za uratowanie Mamy . Dzięki Tobie i tym panom co pomagali .Ta kobieta żyje .Szacunek dla was i Wiele Bożych łask w życiu.👍🥰❤️🌹
Thank you, God for everybody that was involved. Thank you God for the officer and thank you God for the brave children.
That cop was taking a lil long to jump in.
Is it just me or was this copper a little bit too relaxed
Kudos to the kids for being so strong, one seeking help, one staying with her to do whatever she could to help. And kudos to the police officer responding as quickly as he could, doing whatever he could to save that woman.❤
"good samaritan cop"? he's a cop, it's his job
Aww man the look on that young boy face I hope they saved her🥲🙏
Angels on our shoulders. God bless it.
Even the criminal is trying to teach the kid a lesson!
Bravo ,young man. You helped save your Momma ! And thanks to the officer as well and the ems
That cop is very stupid, he’s just asking and asking and nothing of action is really frustrating 🤬
Thanks
😮😮😭😭🙈🙈🙈
❤️🙏🙏🙏❤️
"Tell EMS to step it up!" Wow.,,HERO'S!
" is somebody in there?"  No officer just here in the water screaming help her for Fun!!!! Every moment counts here  then he like here you munch the window kid.  Barley a win
Now here's a true hero!,,,..? Angelman!,,,.? Yes-Yes...and yes!
Damn, some of you commentors need help. You guys hate cops so much you crap on them even here? In this situation? lol
The cop really didnt feel like helping
How is mom???❤
The desperation in that young boy’s voice broke my heart! He saved his momma’s life! ❤
The cop yelling “is anyone in there” at the car when it’s mostly submerged and any anyone in the car wouldn’t be able to hear him or reply pissed me off. Get in the water!!!! Jesus
Blessings for the bystander and police officer 🙏 🙌 prayers for the driver to recover🙏
Yes yes 👏  I don’t even want to imagine what that kids heart was going through  😢
GLORY TO GOD AMEN
My heart😢
He literally told the cop three time already she’s in there “is someone in the car😐” BRO MOVE HE TOLD YOU MULTIPLE TIMES ALREADY the slow ass officer was in zero rush to save her.
In my home town, remarkable kids & rescuers
AFRYKA I AUTO
🙏🏾💜
This is why when you have seizures you loose your DL
It drove me nuts the way the cop stood there and kept asking "is anyone in there?" Like dude, this kid has already told you multiple times that someone is in there! What are you waiting for??
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The towel is asking for help. And he's asking the kid questions. How does he know if the door is unlocked? And yes, his mother. Is in there? That's why he's asking for help. Go help the boy and staking your time.
Suorised they wanted help from cops since there so bad
Annesi kurtuldu mu ?
The boy was so scared but managed to keep it together and was able to let the men know exactly what was happening, including first letting them know that she had a seizure. In my opinion though, I feel like the rescue would have gone faster and easier if people didn't want to record absolutely every situation that happens. 😮 If there was a third person recording that we couldn't see, maybe that would be different. I could be wrong, but it appears in this video that the person trying to open the car door with one hand is the same one recording with other hand.
That kid and officer are heros..saved a life
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
GOD BLESS THE SON, GOOD SAMARITAN, AND THE COP!!!
Laisse la caméra ☹️
God for fuck sakes, CAR IN THE FUCKING WATER / KID PANICKING WHEN YOU AT THE FUCKIN SCENE "IsTh DeRR SumBoDY iN DaRr?"
Wheres the daddy? Shame on him. God had mercy
Great they saved her but that cop couldn't have shown any less urgency or intelligence. Never make it as a firefighter being that lazy
"Is somebody in there?" was crazy. Bro had no urgency. 😐
Always pray for  law enforcement and EMTs and firefighters thank you all for your service!!
Of course there's no father around
God is awesome!
That poor little boy 💔 he was soo scared ans brave and smart
🙏🏾💪🏾bless y'all hearts❤❤❤
Was she saved?
Poor kid
Por favor poner para traducir español
But why is she driving a car if she normally have seizures? That’s irresponsible
God I pray that you reach out touch and covered his family through this tragic situation add touch this police officer 10,000 times and some more unconditionally
The child is the real hero 😢
😢so sorry may you receive healing, complete healing
😢
Omg 😢
The kids told you someone was in there ..why are wasting time asking if someone is in there..
well she won't be able to drive anymore
That poor baby, God love him. I am so glad he could get help for his Momma. I sure hope she is ok.
Take your time too!
Brought tears to my eyes
Cops are so worthless. The kid already told him she was in the car. Dude doesn’t even call for EMS right away. Our safety is our responsibility. We can’t rely on police to be competent much less care.
🙌🙏🙏🙏
why does they allow people that have a history of seizure to own a license? I mean you don't allow total blind people to drive so why? This kind of illness can potentially endangered themselves and everyone while driving and having an attack midway.
No matter what happens, there will always be some negative comments..... always scrutinizing someone's behavior and making it a race thing....... I think that cop did fine..... and I commend him for stepping up to the plate and then hollering that EMS needs to hurry up ..... Y'all folks need to get a life with your negativity
That cop didnt move fast enough for me sounds too old for job not even been nasty just honest
She should’ve known not to park there.
Hoffe der Frau geht es gut😢
The police officer moving to slow for me💯
I hope she's  alright  May God B With her  🙏 🙏 🙏 ❤😊
Must be me cuz dude was moving slow af
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
This officer really has no sense of urgency
That cop is an embarrassment to Texans.. you have been exiled from here..
The blood  of God is fire fire God is nephews psaum 121  The blood of God fire fire fire
he sure is taking his time
Que limdo  menino  corajoso.❤❤❤
Precious boy. He saved his mum. God Bless Him...
Hold up, they told me that all cops were racist. I guess they were wrong.
"...is there somebody in there "...stoopid question
Thanks so much 👏👏👏👍👍
Way to go young man....u saved her life....    ❤
GLAD she was  rescued..❤.     Thought This was thw kid from tv Series Shameless 😮
😢😢😢😢😢
Meu Deus 😢tadinho,ele estava desesperado,Deus o abençoe 🙏🏻❤
So strong boy  he mother is RIP 🪦🙏🏽⭐️
This boy broke my heart😭😭😭😭
@Zellendust
😢😢😢
Oh that poor baby, the fear in his "everything" is heartbreaking. I sure hope she came through it alright. 🥹🙏💝
Everyone saying how brave he is and I agree but man it seamed like that cop was moving a little slow to me lol.
🙏🏾Thank you Jesus
Kid says she’s in the car get to the car jeez ok
White cop saves black lives ...that won't be on the tv media news outlets 🤔
High on fent
Thank god Eddie Murphy saved his mom

Who would've guessed it was a charger driver 🤦‍♂️
Good Samaritan what the f*** are you talking about that's his job to serve and protect
Good boy! It breaks my heart. Godbless 🤍
The stress that child had😤😤😖
If theyd pay more, theyd get civilians like this one to be police officers. But instead of appreciating the men who risk their lives daily to protect ours, we bash the whole due to the 5% who are bad. And tell them they deserve LESS money.   If we want a change, we have to BE the change.
Respect to the officer! Support the officers. There is good and bad in everything and everyone!
mi chiedo: chi ha filmato ?!
Ma era viva? Non si è capito
Tears of joy
That cop wasn’t rushing very much. Poor kid…
See not all cops are bad like some of you like to think 🤔
J espere que la maman est sauve  ..❤❤❤

Sending lots of Blessings Nd love to this Police Officer for his Heroric Actions.❤
I’d think u would be moving a heck of a lot faster than that
Brave child 😢
He's his momma's hero God watch over her 💔
The cop really trying to talk to a car underwater from the side of the road 💀
The kids tells the cop my mom in their, and cops said, is someone in there? What a stupid  question.    😂
Thanks God for placing these two Good samaritans in the path of needing help Thanks God Thanks men of a Good heart Thanks ❤
God bless those people who helped and and stood there for him
Is the Car unlocked 😮 really
Kid was fighting for every second. The cop was like... huh... car in the water... lets have a stroll around the water... how strange... is somebody in there??? hmm strange... hmm... is the car unlocked??? give me a minute and i will start the rescue in just few minutes. He could not be more relaxed and uninterested. Poor boy.
💜💜💜💜
“ she’s having a seizure, she sunk “  super brave little dude and possibly saves her life
That cop couldn’t have moved any slower
Never see the ACAB clowns on these videos
She's in the car....is somebody in there wtf bro
cop just going for a light swim ? hustle bro wtf
Sending prayer's and positive vibes.🙏🙏
Js. Don’t do drugs around your children.
“Is somebody in there” …..he just told you that 🤨
I don't understand. Over the last few years black people have said millions of times in this country how scary police are because they shoot black people so often and without reason. That kid went directly towards this cop and asked him to save his sister. How did that Officer overcome those urges to shoot ???
For those of you who do not support the police, THANK GOD FOR THOSE IN BLUE !
That baby was so brave ❤❤❤
Bro why is he asking if someone is in there? The boy LITERALLY told him that already. What’s with his delay in reaction?💀🤦🏾‍♂️
That my biggest fear as a child. What a traumatic.
Her: “HELP HELP” COP: is anybody in there
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
THANK GOD for this Child and the Angel sent Samaritan 🙏🏽💪🏽🙏🏽💪🏽
Thank God the police weee there at that time to help this family.
I literally don’t wana see shit like this
Thank you for the little boy and the gentle Good Samaritan that rendered aid to save the woman’s life .. God Bless 🙏🏽
My mom is drowning in the car….. “ is someone in there” like why aren’t you running in there idiot
You shouldn't drive while you're having a seizure.
Lord Jesus.
Bless this good policeman ❤❤❤❤
That cop is absolutely useless.."is she in there?" The child already told him she's having a seizure. "Is the car unlocked?" Whatever. So your.job and.break the glass. Once a good Samaritan jumps in the cop acts like.hes.all.big.amd bad..the Samaritan saved her. The Samaritan did all the work..the cop shouted dumb questions and commands. Then took her once the Samaritan saved her. Unbelievable!!!! The Samaritan is the hero 100%
I thought cops loved breaking window to unlock door😂
Blessings to everyone, Her Son and the Policemen championed to save her, Collectively they saved her! God is good!!!
Poor babe. His terrified cries for help. He was so scared for mama, but still managed to hold it together until he found help. He did better than most adults. He did good. He did real good.
💕👌🙏
Thank God they saved that childs mother
Grazie x averla salvata❤
The little boy 🥺💔💔💔
No hate but US cops always seem to act so slow on everything. Dont they understand that every single second counts?
why's American cops asking all these questions in these types of situations
The lack of urgentcy is insane. Kid told you his Mom is in there. Multiple times. Is the car unlocked...is she in there? is there someone in there?...Hope she's ok. An extra. 30 seconds can cause a lot of brain damage.Maybe I'm different but i carry some of my late father's firefighter tools just incase I run into something like this.
This poor child.❤
Back windows breaks easiest.
The fear and desperation in that poor child’s voice gave me chills. That terror he experienced, I hope that Momma is ok and that he doesn’t have reoccurring nightmares. Thank God for his good senses and for the other hero that helped.
Poor baby he’s so scared but at the same time a hero for thinking quickly and running to get help
Not all heroes wear capes
🎉❤🎉
This proves white cops aren't the black devil or against blacks!
SALVÓ  HA SU MAMA PIDIO AYUDA RAPIDO GRACIAS POR COMPARTIR
The cop was too slow! Please take this as an example of how fast and precised you should be in this scenarios 😢 thanks to the other person who was there!! now the kid have his mother back ❤
Time to come to the comment section, sort by newest, and read the deranged shit people are saying.
Don’t you hear her house?
Sweet baby boy ❤
That cop took way to long for action
Nobody remebers the things they do right there always remembered for the things they do wrong 🤷‍♂️
Much blessings to the child and the officer that came to the rescue.  He wasted no time! These are the officers I respect to the fullest!
i feel so bad for the kid i know that feeling but whys she driving if she has seizures
Was the lady ok? I was worried when they blurred her face out! They usually do that when they are deceased!! I hope all that rescue work was worth it!!
Have a sense of fucking urgency.  People loosing their shit and screaming.  Then there’s this guy.  Walking up and asking questions like he’s figuring out how he’s gonna decorate his house.  The hell.
Congratulations ❤
Folks, the boy is a hero just like the cops. And also, the cops sounds white as white can be. Don’t let the politicians divide us, that’s exactly what they want.
LLLEEETTSSS GGGOOOO
“HELP! THERE’S SOMEONE DROWNING IN THE WATER! GET HELP NOW!”  Cop: “Hey, is anybody there?” 🤡
That cop was like nah I don’t feel like getting wet today until he saw another guy in the water. Kid was like my mom’s in the car and he’s just like oh is there someone in there oh well.
That Lil bit is a Hero! ❤Bless his Heart!
Congratulations and respect to all the police officers who are always willing to go beyond the call of duty.
God bless them all. Good people still exist
This story is crazy. Everything about it. I’m glad he’s now in prison.  Sending so much love to the families that lost their loved ones. 😢❤
Cop saved her life
You can hate on the cop but he did go with the kid, jump into a lake in full gear, and make the rescue
No lie a kid telling you his mom is in the water having a seizure then the kid being at the car banging on the window and you stand there and ask is someone in there is crazy
Wonderful❤❤❤.
🙏🏽 😢
😢😢😢 praying she's okay ❤
That little boy did AMAZING! Can’t imagine the sheer terror and panic he was trying to contain, but he found help quickly, and from the right people. Incredible rescue, and hope they’re doing ok now. 🙏
🙏🏻♥️👼💥🕊
Damn that cop was fucking useless
💔😭
FYI EVERYONE; Breaking a car window is not as easy as it looks and you have to punch it in the lower corner and not the center. I carry a tool in my glove box just in case. Poor kid-sure hope his momma is ok and the cop stayed so calm!♥️
This is one of my greatest fears. That I’m driving and something happens while I am driving. Like a seizure, or heart attack or I pass out. 😅
Obrigada SENHOR
Why the cop asking if someone is in there after the child is telling him his mother is in there then the child has to beg to help her and when he didn't move fast enough the child went in to help where is the  sense of urgency from this police officer smdh!!
It's crazy to me how far some people will go just to hate a cop, even when they do something good. So many people acting like the cop did nothing to help, saying he didn't help, he was too slow. They're ignoring the fact that another random person was also there trying to help, and they're giving all credit to the kid for saving his mother. Why can't we actually give credit to the cop, the good Samaritan and the kid, because whether you like it or not, all 3 played a part in saving the woman. Anyway, credit to all 3, and I'm glad the mother survived.
Cop not exactly moving urgently enough is he? Take your time mate fs
Is somebody in there? The boy just said she was! Precious seconds, stupid questions. Just my opinion.
Ngl I did not like how fucking little urgency the officer seemed to have when he saw the car. I would been sprinting over to it.
That cop sucks "is somebody in there" why is he going so slow
Thank you, Officer. God bless you all.
Clearly if the boy saying she had a seizure in the car that means someone is in there but he probably saying it to make sure
0 sense of urgency. Shes lucky the car wasnt fully submerged or the cop wouldnt have even tried. The kid saved his own mom while the cop acted annoyed.
Worlds slowest cop 😅
"Is somebody in there?" Bro he said she had a seizure. Get in the fucking water.
that cop was moving pretty slow in the beginning but at least the mom was saved
About 30 miles from where I was born.
Спасать это ладно,главное вначале камеру включить ,мальчик подбежал по команде ,,мотор,,?!
😢😢😢😢😢😢🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is this the lil kid that was singing do it again if they look alike
Of course it took a random stranger to save her. He was just tappin on the window but if it was a traffic stop, he would not have no problem just in the window out if you didn’t roll it down far enough fr
Window dum dum ..Window!!! Stop trying to open the door...smh
This is what cops jobs are. Not writing dumb tickets for wondow tint or bothering people working in an auto shop at 2am or chasing bikers or people doing a simple 10mph over the bs posted speed limit.
Question !  How the car ended up there ?
Seizures are a terrifying thing.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🥲🥲🥲
Thank U LORD
She was revived, then given a ticket for illegal parking.
Boy Cries an tells cop his mom is in the car under Water. Cop Sees the car and first thing he does is Askin „is there some one in there?“. How to wäre critical time 😊
He was brave. No love like the love from your child❤
The cops very fast response to this was amazing😑
Omg.
😢
Seizures are no joke.  My nephew died at 24 while having a seizure in his sleep and my dad just died from his first one, one week ago while taking a shower. If you have a loved one or friend with seizures, offer them a ride when you can, check on them once in a while too.  Don't make them feel bad if they can't live alone.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I'm glad they managed to save her in the end but the cop's reaction looks very nonchalant.. He wasn't rushing to get to the car, no urgency at all.. Like he didn't want to get wet (or something else if you catch my drift). Very sus!! I'm thinking he only helped because there was another civilian (witness) helping already.
Cop wasn't really trying to help smh the good samaritan is the hero here...is anyone in there? Yea man my mom is stuck in there!!!
Boy did his job praise God i hope his mother is ok  and pull through this.. Glory to God to the police officer 💪💪🙏💙  He did hesitate to tell the boy hop in He told the paramedics to STEP IT UP...
Why the cop act so slow?
They weren't in too much of a hurry were they
Did she have a seizure? or did something else happen? It’s an African American driving a dodge charger could have just been speeding and drove into the water
Cop taking his time to be extra sure he really needs to get his socks wet
On this day race didn't matter life did
A few good men save lives and change worlds God bless
Wow. What a sense of urgency
This makes me scared. I'm an epileptic this is my biggest fear. Big ups to that officer doing his job cuz most officers would have been assholes to that little boy.
Kid pleas with cop to save his mom in the car. Cop asks if there’s anyone in the car when he gets to it. 🤦‍♀️ like he didn’t wanna get wet or something….. what an idiot in my opinion
Dude I know he saved her but he was wayyyy too calm and slow for me
This young man saved his momma. It's amazing that 7.6k viewers disliked this video. May a higher power bless your hateful hearts.
Cop did not want to get in to help
The worst cop ever ...took to dam long ..."is someone in there?" Duh dip shit
Cnn wont show this
gracias a Dios por permitir que estos valientes hombres pudieran  pasarán por este lugar y auxiliarlos, espero que también aya atendido a el niño estaba demaciado asustado
Did she survive?
God bless the young man and Shout Out To The Police Officer!!!!!  God bless you Sir!
This is to sad. Hope his mom is ok. Lord Jesus. Life is scary. Accidents happens so fast unexpected.
A este señor le estorbaba mucho la camara para ayudar como devia de ser menos mal que ya habia un señor ayudando
Where was this guy when Ted Kennedy was around?
Lord god is good it wasn’t her fault and thank the good man for being there on spot to help her out of a life or death situation
Slow ass cop asking stupid questions
GOD BLESS THIS CHILD AND POLICE OFFICER 💕🙏💞
Oh my God, how terrifying! The boy did so well and so did the officers! Can anyone tell me if she made it?
im pretty sure he told you enough times someome was in there 😂
Omg that sweet boy 😞
Blessed their hearts
This cop needs some fucking urgency training. Way too lackadaisical for a fucking car in the water with a woman drowning. Plus you already knew the situation , you were told prior.
Cop was casually walking and  asking if anyone in was in  there  without no heavy breathing so it's clear he desperately wanted to help .
Because we all know doors will just open after pulling the handle 30 times
Sir STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND HELP THEM.
Good samaritan? Isn’t this their job to serve and protect?
The cop was in no hurry that was very irritating to me.
It's so heartbreaking to watch these little ones go through this kind of stuff. 😢.  I hope the lady I'd okay. ❤🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Why was the cop asking if anyone was in there. Sir that baby told you his mother was having a seizure 😒
Cops be moving slow af🤦🏽‍♂️
Kid runs to get this guy and he goes is someone in there I'd be fucking running in that water
Cop a Samaritan?  Isn't this, like, his job??? So he is payed for that ??  That's not a samaritan
Seeing this kid so desperate for his mom made me cried 😭
Why was the cop even asking questions. Like dude just go
Please, I hope they get him some therapy because he will surely have PTSD. Sometimes adults take the resilience of children for granted until they become broken adults.
He was kind of irritating me when he kept asking was someone in there like he told you that before yall even got to the car 😭
So much to unpack here… Seeing his mom have a seizure while driving The crash into the pond The escape from the vehicle to get help Working with officers to help his mom What a day that was.. definitely a day that will never be forgotten
"Good summaritan" doesn't apply to anyone doing anything decent ever. It's his job, this is to be expected of him at minimum. It's supposed to be a heroic job, that's true, but still. The point of the good Samaritan is Samaritans were notoriously like the comical racist version of jews the modern world has so one bothering to care for someone that couldn't possibly pay them back is unexpected
This kid is a true hero 😢
Is there an update 😢😢
This officer need to be commended and rewarded for his bravery and for helping save this lady's life and for changing his boy's life!  This is an awesome example of a great officer doing what he's supposed to do and protecting the public. HE IS A HERO AND SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS ONE!❤❤❤
Sstupid police, question questions. Is anybody there? He ask the boy told him very loud and clear that his mother is in the water POS
❤
Chargers have to be the new ram srt10’s
Thank you to all who helped in all ways❤
Cop was moving mad slow
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Those poor children most have been so scared😢 Im so happy their mum was saved and that their famliy so stil complete❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏 Bless them❤🙏
Jesus
Drenched boy comes running to a cop then cop proceeds to pull up. “Is someone in there, is someone in there” 😂 idk maybe go to the car and see since you were told someone is drowning geez
So, how did the kid get out? Hope mom wasn't injured.
THANK YOU LORD JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH FOR JOHN3V16. WE LOVE YOU TOO.AMEN❤❤❤
You won’t see this on CNN
Where's the tow truck
Thank you sir and everyone that helped this family.
Did his mama survive ya al??😢😢
Whoa that gave me chills…about 10yrs ago I started having seizures. My kids were pretty young at the time. To think that this could’ve easily been me with my children in the car😭 my dog was alerting me to the seizures before they’d happen so I had her registered as a service dog and started taking her EVERYWHERE with me. Thank God, doctors found the cause of mine and got them under control❤❤ Bless that little boys heart, the fear in his voice and all over his face was just gut wrenching. Looks like the good Lord put that officer in the right place at the right time!!❤
“Come on get in”thank u lord  he listened to the kid while he was panicking and didn’t waste anytime tryna be authoritative
wtf is the cop doing? “Is someone in there?” As the two people are begging for help
El niño es más resolutivo, el tipo un tarado
He is a hero everyone involved god had everyone where they needed to be wow ❤❤❤❤❤.
God bless that police officer how much love to the family ❤️
Good samaritan cop?Isnt it his fucking job and not an altruistic act ?!
“Is somebody in there?” The kid told you she was buddy. Also, I don’t think she can hear you.
People who have seizures don't need to drive. Change my opinion.
Why tf is he asking the 8 year old questions? You are supposed to exhibit confidence and give the kids a sense of you know what tf your doing. Officer fails here in all ways!
Dude was taking his time
Wow thank God he was with her. He said she was having a seizure and she's in the water. They all deserve an award for bravery.
OMG OMG OMG!
Poor kid, I hope she was ok! 🙏
That poor boy, this is so traumatic and scary for that boy. He saved his  momma!
Thank you jesus amen 🙏 🙌 ❤️ 💖 ❤
😢nice the kid stepped in
Kudos to the Good Samaritan already there and the cop! And to the lil boy, your fear was your strength!👌🏾💎❤️🔥
Brave kid. Calm rescuer. I panicked more than him just watching it.
So what happened did they take her to the hospital  or did  she die why doesn't he go in instead of asking all the questions.  DAM IT
Omg
This cop is an idiot
🙏🏾
That cop sucks
The dumbest people wearing badges...sunken car and "is somebody in there...?" 😂😂 reply - "gup-gulp-gulp!
Why is he asking before he goes in  when the kid is obviously upset ?
😢😢😢meu Deus 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 abençoe todos vocês 🙏🙏🙏
Commenters assuming the mom is black.
When he said here hope in I was thinking WHAT UR GOING TO ARREST THIS LITTLE BOY so thank God they believed him poor kid I'm glad he got out to get her help thank God please save her life.
Does anyone have an update? Did the mom make out ok?
How sad!!! My heart broke for him
Is there someone in there? Really?
“She sunk she’s in the water.” Other guy: “is somebody in there?” Uh yeah buddy
cop so dumb he had to keep asking is somebody in there 😂
Dios que alegría 😂😂😂 Siempre serás bendecido por Dios❤
Idk why some of you are making this about race he did his job get a life you keyboard warrior losers
Omg 😳🥺poor kids remain me my grandson 😰he was so desperate 😩
I thought legally you aren't allowed to drive if you have any of the seizer conditions
The cop wasted alot of time
Wtf why was he asking if someone was there he just said she was having a seizure how would she respond from within the water🤨
💔 thank God for this little guy and the officers that helped him and believed him right away.
Harris clowns would look at this and then comment "defund the police"
I know chargers are boats. I dont think they float, though.
I would love to know the entire story. Were police called, and if so, by who? Or did they just happen to be driving by? Was it truly a seizure? Is she ok? This is an amazing thing, to (potentially) have saved a life.
“Is the door locked?” come on bro
Can someone please reply to this comment so I know if I’m getting shadow banned?
The cop asking this kid the same question he already knows the answer to 🤦🏾‍♀️ .. of course she’s in there.. what difference does it make if the door is unlocked? START THE RESCUE!!
This breaks my heart. Bless this family
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sent chills raving through my soul. Bless they heart God bless everyone invloved
If she is too weak to save herself in an easy situation like this , she shouldnt be allowed to have kids
Look at these raycist ass cops  lmso
Cop stayed calm and helped the child love to see it
She’s a paid actor
Bless the kids hearts, but if Mama knows she suffers from epilepsy, she shouldn't be driving. She could kill someone or herself and kids.
Thank God both are safe ❤
that cop was moving way too slow
Everybody listen up! This happens so often and no one is ever going to be prepared. This is what you NEEDDD to do NOW. Buy a two in one window breaker and seatbelt cutter. I’m telling you, you need it! I made my mom take hers
❤god bless you.
Talking abt is there someone on there? Did you not hear the boy say my mom had a seizure before you put him in your car ? 😂
😢😢😢
Hay que romper
The cop is asking is some one in there and the boy is in the dawn water, yelling help, SMFH!! He helped but he was real slow about it!!
Siempre el parabrisas trasero
The power of Love shown here!
Thank to the good Samaritan blessing to all of them amen
Proud of you little man ❤❤❤❤
Poor baby! How did the boy get out? I’m so confused? Baby’s window must have been open and he was traumatized but stayed strong. 💪 What are the odds that a police officer was nearby? So many questions! Our guardian angels are always there. Even when it’s your time it’s your time. Souls have missions and purpose, here or elsewhere. I hope she made it for herself but more so for her baby boy!
Of course it was a Dodge
Poor boy 🥺❤️ I hope he and his mother are okay now and doing well in life.
Rescues? He asked the most ridiculous questions before he would act. The kid told him his mom was in there. He then asks "is she in there? Are the doors locked?" GIVE ME A BREAK!
Why did that cop take his sweet ass time though
The scream of this boy made me cry and gave me goosebumps.
I've never seen someone so nonchalant about a rescue seems like this guy didn't want to get his f****** pants wet.
I'm surprised that the cop didn't demand the kid's ID before helping....
What a kid, wow.
👏👏👏👏
Seizure diving? How did she get a license? The kid clearly knows his mother is epileptic. So sad
First thing in the morning and pouring tears. God bless this young man for saving his mom !
“IS sOmEboDy in ThEre” yes they said someone was in there ya wasted a lot of time standing there asking
the cop is so ridiculous. “is somebadeh in thar??” as the kid is crying out trying to get you to help his momma
😭😭😭😭
Poor baby;; but, he handled it WELL!  Even in his fear!
That's not a cop. He is a father and a husband.
in mississippi you’ll have to worry about 3 things.. Getting the mom out, Making sure the kid and yourself are safe, and the big ass gators we have
Any de-fund the police lunatics out there?
uma voz de descaso do pol****no olhar da criança percebe se 😢
I Pray She Is Okay 🙏🏼 She Has A Super Hero 🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
“Thank god” thank the kid and the officer. If that boy didn’t run to the officer he’d be without a mother forever scared. God has nothing to do with it.
Lol just casually standing on the edge after a boy runs in the road and says she had a seizure she’s literally drowning submerged ina. Pond “HEY IS ANYONE IN THERE”   not,… jumps in and goes to check lmao.   CMON GANGGGG
Good Samaritan cop? So you telling me there are cops out there that would not help?
So sorry that happen is very hard for anyone something like
These officers need to choose a new job
How do you come in as an officer to serve and protect but think about yourself first is crazy to me .
That boys crys for his mamas safety had me crying like fr
Blacks + doge 😂😂😂😂
Praise God!!!! And Father, bless all who had a hand in saving this mother's life.
😮😮😮😮😮
What a wonderful, wonderful boy ❤❤❤
HOPE HIS MOM IS O.K
Made me cry poor baby I hope they are okay 🥺
Good job on the kid for being concise in the information he told the officer while freaking out that’s gotta be the most terrifying thing and he was able to keep his cool long enough to get help
Lo insensato es preguntar si esta ahi
"hello is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? "  After the kid just told him my mom is in there having a seizure. TF
Is somebody in there😢
Sorry but cop was way too slow for me! Him asking if someone was in there infuriated me.
The lack of urgency is ridiculous by the cop.
Well done, all!! Hope the lady is safe and fine.
❤❤❤
Beautiful video 😢!
He’s an angel 🙏🙏🙏 god bless him and give him strength to overcome anything ❤️
Man thank God they saved her but where was the urgency dude casually walking asking questions peoplen drown real fast dive in there man
This is why we need cops
How did the police arrive in just enough time to save her ?  Did the kids have a phone or just miracle luck that a officer came by ?
💜
Good job kid. God loves you the same way you love your mother. He loves you even more.🙏❤️❤️🙏🙏❤️
That took the cop to long the kid got in the water before the cop shame on the cop for not jumping in before the kid
ขอให้ปลอดภัยค่ะ
when they are like anyone in the car when literally they are drowning
That poor boy, having to go through that but he still stayed on target to get help. Lord bless that child
This cop is kinda dumb...
I'm glad the Samaritan listened to this baby ❤❤❤ and moved quickly, God bless him.
Sending prayers
That cop took his sweet ass time like what the hell? Guess he probably didn’t want to get wet
Okay kudos to the kid, but also ive seen enough of these to realize that often times the kids seem somewhat used to the idea of their parent having a seizure. That would mean someone who has history of seizures is choosing to operate a motor vehicle despite that being a reason to be un-licensable and just a clear disregard for safety.
Had to look this story up:::From People Mag..She spent over three weeks on a ventilator, however, is recovering well and breathing on her own, Holman shared as she thanked first responders for their quick life-saving efforts. This 12yr old child's fear and love for his momma is just instantly chilling. I'm so happy they got to her just in time. She was pulled from the car with no pulse. God bless this young child Dwight, his sister, the officer, the bystander and his momma. Everyone helped this to be a happy ending. ❤🙏🏾
How many times is he  going to ask is  someone in the car when the child said his  mom , I felt like  this took sooo long 😢
I cried so hard 😭
People like these gentlemen restore faith in humanity
🥺
Is somebody in there? Obviously!
Oh my goodness, this baby gad me in tears. His desperation 😭😭😭😭. I jope she made it out ok
Thank you God for sparing her life and empowering her to son to with the necessary help needed to rescue her and the healing she is or has received. ❤❤❤❤
ça aurait été plus facile si il tenait pas son tel dans ses mains pour poster et faire le buzz
“Is somebody in there” Bruhh the kid just told his mom is in there having a seizure why would anyone respond
Tearing up 😢😢 just watching this…
How many times that fool need to ask if she’s in the car? wtf do you think Einstein?
What is the update? Is she ok?
Thank you sir where ever you are in the world I hope God Almighty Bless you with long life, health, and Riches‼️🙏🏾😇
😢🙏
Why the cop keep asking is somebody in there when the boy said his mom was in there 😀
Oh but ppl won't see this strong white man helping save this kids life. They only look at the bad some evil ppl do and paint all of them like that
Gloria a Dios, gracias Padre...,porque tú haces todas las cosas nuevas. Amén.
How are you gonna see the water moving and ask if someone is in there
By all means, officer. Stand there asking if someone is in the car instead of going to help.
God save this woman…,
o poor kid, he went for help and got help, thank you good people for helping this woman and her kid.
The cop like is someone in there  bro go in and see stop asking questions
Theres a frantic crying little boy on the road, then  car underwater and teenage girl in the water crying  momma momma help at the drivers window. Foghorn leghorn waddles up and asked is she in there? I said, now i said is somebody in there? If you have any kind good judgement move your ass buddy. The waters  obviously not electrified.I dont wanna hear, well you never know now a days, be  professiona,l remain calm bull crap. You have to react to Fires and drowning. Have the punch in you hand before you even get to the seen. The kid told u everything. Their  not gonna rob you and kill you.
Can’t swim and driving a dodge charger. Man I thought she’d be white!
An 😇 was with that child and mother 🙏☝️🙌
He got out that car and did what he needed to do to save his momma that is will power and love
Thank you GOD so much father in the name of Jesus Christ 😔 father glory father glory
Come on.   No cop hating.  😂😂😂.  I can’t believe it.   YouTube world not once not putting a police officer down for risking their life every day to protect people who hate on them.   Hmmmmm.
This cop took his sweet fkn time didn’t he
I would have died right there by her car door trying to get her out.  Great job young man, good samaritan, and cop for rescuing this woman.
God bless this baby and his momma ❤ saying my prayers. I know baby I know my son and I are just as close. You’re a hero!
Kid said his mom is drowning in the car he just wrecked in …cop :”is someone in there” *casually wading to the car” ….why are cops like this?
Kid: Please save her. Cop: are you sure someone is in there next time more action an less talk
Man I hope he saved her! I haft to admit though  it was the most lackadaisical one I've ever seen 😮
Cop gonna stand there and ask if she in there, like nah dude I’m just wasting my breath
Thank you sir for saving her🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
TO GOD BE THE GLORY AMEN 💞 🙏 💕
Way too slow
Hjjjjgvhjhjfhz gh😮😮😮😊😊😊❤❤❤❤jvcbhvjcbvg ist das Baby 🚼 und ist eine Termin für die Kinder jhjj
Damn i hate people like this cup, in situation each milliseconds can save lives they asked stupid questions
Man, she was meant to live. God bless her
That poor child! I pray his mother is going to be ok.
The child says yes and you still asking 😅
How’d the kid get out tho?
thanks
Anjos na terra   glória a Deus🙏🙏🙏
Thank God 🙏🏾
I know it's a part of life but I hate seeing people traumatized like this. So happy the officers could help.
Alabado seas mi Dios que esa Señora va mejorando cubrela con tu misericordia padre a ella y asu hijos
🙏🏾 Praise God for a true Police Officer doing the right thing❤
Man, that’s so sad that he had to be the one to run and find help when something terrible like this happened. Hopefully his momma sees this video and realizes who her heroes are. Not only for the first responders, but the love in her son’s heart.
This is why seizure people aren't allowed to drive. But the woman probably knew that and drove anyway.
Stupid ! He said “ She sunk”! and he’s steady asking “Is she in there?”
samaritan,....?
Well done guys..heart stopping rescue❤
this police must go to jail,...
Did they resuscitate her?! Who edited this?! Dear God what's wrong with you!
God thank you for your good people and kids 🤩🤩💯💯👍👍❤️❤️
People who experience seizures aren't supposed to drive. It can happen at any time 😢
Aww God bless
1 in 26 americans will develop epilepsy in their lifetime. For some of us- They strike months or even years apart​. My first seizure wasn't until 28 yo and the second was 8 months later. When you've never had one before- You don't understand "auras" and don't realize it's a warning that something terrible is about to happen. The unlucky ones don't get auras, therefore no warning. There are many types of seizures, other than grand mal's (seen in movies). They all look different, and looking these up could save someones life- Even a loved ones!  -Do not restrain people in active seizure. Instead, put them on their side incase they foam at the mouth. Place something under their head if they are hitting it and move away anything that they could hurt themselves on.  - Do NOT try to keep someone from "choking on their tongue". Thats a myth.  - Time the seizure if you can. How many minutes was it. When they stop-Start timing again bc if they have a second seizure within 5 minutes that's a HUGE red flag and drs will need that info. Obvs time following seizures/inbetweens as well.
someone is there,.? for real,...the boy gets to you,...the boy drives with you, and because its water you ask if someone is in there,...????
The kid walks up runs up hysterical is there somebody in there ? No there's nobody in there I'm just wet and hysterical for no reason he's an idiot.
You can see the lost and worried all over his face, most painful look ever. 2yrs ago I watched my son as he watched me try to save his momma, we never brought her back that day but that look he had on this face haunts me.
Mama's little hero!❤
Abc what is with the description? That kid isnt a "good samaritan" its his MOM in that car. He's not some random bystander!
Poor baby
Sorry this cop is an idiot
Nah if I have a seizure and wake up with my dodge charger half way out the ground go ahead and let me die
How is he asking some one that is under water if some one is there bro go get in that water what Do we pay you for 🤦🏼‍♂️
Did anyone get to read the true outcome? Or are the comments of being saved, assumptions? I can’t find the rest of the video that’s why I’m asking, to see if she truly made it. I pray 🤲 she did. That boy did all he could. He was all wet from being in the water too. 😢
Is the car unlocked?😮
“MY MOM IS DROWNING AND HAVING A SEIZURE SHES IN THE WATER HELP”   This guy “Is ThErE AnYbODy In ThERe” while wasting precious seconds knowing full well there is actually somebody in there DYING
Another gps accident
Poor baby.. such a blessing to have him for a child mama
Asmar be like:
Poor wet child: My mom.. she’s having a seizure… she’s in the water… she sunk! Cop: **Waits a couple CRUCIAL seconds** “is somebody in there?”  … “is she in there?”  …. . Jesus! I hope she survived.  P.s. it seems like there’s ALWAYS water around right when an accident is about to happen, I swear!  A body of water rolls in like excuse mee 💨 🙄
That cop is slow as hell. Like speed it up every second counts
This is heart breaking. When you need to drive but shouldn't
Teach your kids to swim,to read,to write,speak correct english,respect each other,what do yall do with these kids,smfh
Defund the police; they’re no good to anyone especially the ones who risk their lives to save us. Who do you call when there’s no cop anywhere???????
Too bad black people cant swim,she would have already been out
Slowest moving cop ever
God bless you
Dio ti benedica❤
The kid, the cop, the samaritan. Angels.
Thanking God and the Good Samaritans
Was he expecting the car to say yah i got someone in here
Just the “is anyone in there?” Get your ass in the water
This is heart wrenching and it disgusts me that it's being used as propaganda to promote police. THIS COP DID HIS JOB, AND HE BARELY DID IT AT THAT. HE HESITATED AND QUESTION A CRYING DISTROUGHT BOY FROM THE SIDE OF THE WATER AFTER HE HAD ALREADY CLEARLY TOLD HIM HIS MOTHER WAS TRAPPED INSIDE. A true "hero" wouldn't have hesitated for a moment to act if there was even a possibility that someone may be in the vehicle. What this cop did was the absolute BARE MINIMUM for a public servant in this position. We need to EXPECT MORE and STOP PRAISING MEDIOCRITY.
“She sunk, she’s in the water” then the cop really asked is someone in there. Yeah he saved her but should be evaluated
Thank God the little boy knew what was going on and for the caring cop who went above and beyond.  There is hope for this human race!
Kid tells cop moms in the car in the water approaches vehicles and ask if anybodys in there until the kid has to tell u AGAIN and be told to go help her, this dude is not a cop nor a hero
2 days prior they was both saying fk the blue..
After 4 business days is somebody in there like why would a random kid just come up and say that shit and plus the car is in the water of course someone is in there
What a good kid....lil hero ...❤
Omg 😢💔💔💔💔
That poor kid....cop seemed a little slow.  Woman's drowning and he's kind moseying...
"Is somebody in there?" Dumb question when the boy already said so. What a waste of time and a lack of swift action.
I hope she’s okay. Poor kid 🙏
Good Samaritan cop? I thought thats what they are supposed  to do? Ijs
Glad the Right kinds of Cops answered the call!!
Where is this cop’s sense of urgency? Seconds count.
Whay?police use like 15min befor going in or runn to safe them😂😂😂come on crazy
God Bless U All 🙏🙏🙏🙏💕
Poor baby 🥺
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Kid-She sunk she is in the water.... cop-is someone in there?....bruh he just told you she was in there.
Good bless that young man prayers for him and his family
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
The child has just told him his mum is in there. Officer is wasting valuable minutes
The reaction time was just so bad by the look of the young man help was needed urgently.
That wasn't a boy that was a man that saved his mom
So sad😢
Not only was this kid brave through his mums seizure but also experiencing a crash and seeing his mother drowning what a brave wee guy getting help for his mum in such a shocking and overwhelming situation.
Once i was a Child like this. Now im a Monster My Heart Break for myself
💜🍒🍒THANKS YOU MR. POLICE OFFICER FOR SAVING THIS YOUNG BLACK BOY MAMA. I WILL NOT FORGET YOU  SAVE A BLACK WOMAN A GOOD DEED💜🍒🍒YAHNICE 💜🍒🍒
U guys sure momma survived? She was under water for a good while it looks like
Looks like Liam from shameless. Hope his moms ok
Thank god a police or duty came to help save her 🙏
Thank you, Lord, for his help and her son
This is what the left wants to defund.
My God! I pray she's alright!
Wie furchtbar sowas als Kind zu erleben, alles gute 🍀
All police are not bad.
I've never understood  why people  have to ask so many times what's going on while standing  there  like get out there and ask WHILE DOING SOMETHING
God Bless
Poor kid
Dieu soit loué ❤
😂😂😂😂
😢😢
Did she live?
Is anyone in there?  Is the car unlocked? That kid was way more competent than the cop...at least they helped. 🤦‍♂️
Jeez, sense of urgency?
Lol.. Is it me, or DiS that kid say like 3times that Somebody Is the car And policeman still asking?:D
Oh that brave child 😢 ❤
I heard the mans accent and immediately wondering of there would be any gators in that water 😮
That little boy. His terror and desperation to save his mother teared me right up.
iS sOmEoNe In tHeRe? I don't know man, maybe someone just parked their car underwater
This dumass was useless
Is the car unlocked? Has it been waxed lately?😮
And he got back in the water true Soulja
Gald everybody safe
Was she saved? Was she alive?
Praise be to God
He was forced to save her cause there was a witness there other wise he wasn’t gettin in the water. He hesitated at the bank and said is someone in there. A real HERO would have got in the damn water. Yal stop meat riding
No way
What a dumb Cop.
Is the car unlocked? Is someone in there? Bro he’s going crazy telling you his mom is in there run in there and get her out not the time to ask questions my boy
Q Deus abençoe essa família,  q gritos de partir o coração 😢😢😢😢
My mom had a seizure on the toilet once when I was growing up. I was 10 I thought she died . I was crying , so glad this woman was saved . I felt the pain this kid was experiencing. Being too small to help will drive you insane. I remember crying to try and lift my mother an get her clothes together before I called the ambulance I didn’t want them to see her like that..
❤God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.❤For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, Jesus ❤'s you 1 John 2:1-29 ESV [1] My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. [2] He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. [3] And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. [4] Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, [5] but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him: [6] whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.  [7] Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard. [8] At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. [9] Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. [10] Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. [11] But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. [12] I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake. [13] I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father. [14] I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.  [15]  Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. [16] For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. [17] And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.  [18] Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour. [19] They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us. [20] But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge. [21] I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. [22] Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. [23] No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. [24] Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. [25] And this is the promise that he made to us—eternal life. [26] I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. [27] But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie—just as it has taught you, abide in him.  [28] And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming. [29] If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.  😊
how about a little more fuckin urgency? wow
where is the fire department?
That cop was in no rush whatsoever.
Poor Boy, his LOVE Mum is safely is amazingly. Thank God!!! That’s Boy is a good job. Wow! ❤❤
That poor boy!!! His terror and desperation brings tears to my eyes. I hope he got help fast enough😢
🙏🏾💯
He was in no rush
😢 hope they all ok ❤
It physically hurts to watch this
Salvo gente  a pessoa😮
Can't believe some people in the comments are saying he's racist because he asked the question multiple times, oh the state of some poeple 😂
... and the cop is taking all his sweet time...
I thought this for a second, "Help her quickly!" and then I realized that he was doing that (asking if she's in there) for his own safety.  He wouldn't have followed the kid if he didn't genuinely want to help save a life, it's just that in this world we live in, unfortunately even kids can be used as some sort of bait to commit evil and that's just the sad sad reality.   Both are heroes! God bless them 🙏
Wtf is wrong with this cop
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Le Garçon c'est l ange gardien de sa maman ❤❤❤
Eigther, the officer had no urgency or was I too anxious 😢
Thank The Police Officer too he had the tool to break the windows glass with out him She were not make it and God too He has the last word.
Is somebody in there? Did you not hear the young man
there's a reason cop asked, to know weather she's still in the car or she sunk down in the pond. many are too narrow minded to think of that and just jump into conclusions.
Woooo hero
❤
She's having a seizure.  She's in there.  My mom! My mom 😢. Help her 😢. Tha boy acted very fast
What a Brave young man! God Bless him
The stupiest question in this Situation. The policeofficer is an idiot, maybe?
Oohhhhh😢😢
Béni soit le seigneur je viens de sauver ta maman ❤️
Why the f the cops waste so much time calling if somebody in there? Is it some kind of protocol or something?
Thanks O Jesus, Who Saved the Woman!!!
Plz full vidéo
The slowest cop I've ever seen
Bless you ❤
Graças a Deus que deu tudo certo 🙏
You take 1 million dollars, an at every water source you leave a fireman hose,boomm lives are important again
How did the kid get out of car ?
Did dude really ask if somebody was in there???
Did he have to ask that dumb question tho?
Every home needs someone like this child he is very brave and knows exactly what he want!!!! Good job❤
😮 to have a child run up screaming telling you that their mother is in the water and you got the nerve to pull up and ask if anybody is in there you should have been diving in like lifeguard the idiocy something is spiritually wrong with individuals!
Admirable young man. I hope everything turned out okay
Gott sei Dank gerettet 💝
And black people hate the cops 👮‍♀️ 😒  its sad
Man that’s heartbreaking to hear that poor young man so scared for his loved ones😢! He definitely was very brave and got help!! Outstanding young man in a time of such horror. I pray they are all safe and healthy now!
That cop sure took his sweet time...
IS SHE IN THERE? IS SOMEBODY IN THERE?🗣️🗣️
He actin like he didn't want to help,if the child is saying his mom's drowning.. move your Ass ❤❤❤❤
This kid is going to become a cop or emergency service provider. He communicates clearly and precisely under great pressure.   Bless his beautiful heart. And thanks to the cop.
God bless them all ♥️ 🙏 love
Que tiste ver el niño.  Pero que alegría ver que la mamá fue rescatada.
Espero em Deus que ela em especial esteja bem 🙏🏽🙌🏽
When I grow up, I want to be a cop, 100% authority with zero responsibility or consequences.
Boy did not hesitate and showed true bravery in a very dangetous and scary situation. Had he not gone for help his poor mama might not have made it. Kudos kiddo you're a true hero! ❤
Scroll down to about the 17th post below for full info.
Quiebra el vidrio de atrás!! Es lo más recomendable!!
This is scary and sad, if the child knew she had a seizure, she's likely had them before. And to drive with seizures, with your kid in the car? She shouldn't haven been driving. My mother had a single seizure due to a brain tumor and it took a year AFTER the removal before she was allowed to drive again.
This is absolutely  terrifying 😢
I hate people that repeatedly ask ANSWERED QUESTIONS 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️it’s even worst in dire situations
Boy screaming her mom is in the car and he still asks the car if there's anyone there.
Why is he recording?
kid did terrible should have helped his mom
Going so slow
Wasting time asking if someone is in there!!! You see a car in The water! Her kid is crying telling you the story!!! It's not like the victim can reply! Act NOW ask later!!!!
Did he say, "She is having a seizure"?
No te vayas a apurar tanto poli jajajajaja
❤❤
Meu Jesus Misericórdia 😭😭😭😭
Why was the cop asking the kid if someone was in there. Even after the kid told him that his mum was in the car 🙄😮‍💨
He will become very protective over his mom going forward
Little boy: save my mom she’s in there.  Cop: is anyone in there
😢
TO GOD BE THE GLORY❤
I saw this news story on the news after it happened, glad to hear she's doing well, God bless her and especially her kids for not panicking and was able to get help 🙏👍💕
Thanks and glory to god, thank you Father for good souls ❤sending my Love the everyone 😊
Thank you very much❤❤❤❤
That officer understands and lives up to his oath to protect and serve
This cop didn't seem interested in helping at all
Wat bout crocs, are they in that water 😮
Poor little boy 😢 I hope his mum was OK 😢
Si ma il telefono posarlo x aiutare meglio no è....🤨
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
GLORY TO GOD FOR THIS LITTLE BOY AND THIS AWESOME OFFICER 👮 YESSSSS 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Smaritan cop? Or their job
I have two sons and lord that baby’s cry hit me. Good job son! ❤
I had ALMOST the same experience. The good thing is I ended up I'm a field. Her son is wonderful and brave❤
❤❤❤
He was so scared too. He’s his mommas hero. God bless them all all.
❤❤❤
The problem is they're giving licenses to people that don't know how to drive yet and they're not only harming themselves they're harming other people on the road you can't just hand out licenses like their candy and that's what they do to people that are in their 40s in late 30s and have never driven a vehicle It's crazy.
Insurance scam
Whoever titled this short clearly doesn't understand the parable of the good Samaritan
What was the cameraman doing !????
Hmmm y'all really be falling for scams
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💕💙
The cops were asking if theres anyone in the car so they could charge the kid with underage driving 😂
Angles at work Thank You 🙏🏽 Heavenly Father
จะตะโกนถามทำไม มีใครอยู่ในรถ โอ้ยน้อ?
that's why in the uk we put crash barriers/railings on the sides of nearly all our main roads to stop vehicles going off into dodgy places like this
Why where they so chill in the beginning
ALL POLICEMAN NOT BAD MAY GOD BLESS YOU BOTH OFFICERS ,THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SERVICES
Amazing 😮thanks for so brave hijo(son)❤❤❤
The kkkop didn't seem to be in a hurry to help
No matter what happens there will always be the crowd with pitchforks. They saved this woman. You guys are ridiculous.
Alligators
Great job, young man.  Your mother is likely very proud of you.  I hope Mom can get her seizures to a manageable point.  Bless them both 🙏
Why are they so slow,,it's about life and death
Useless police officer
Good Samaritan feels like he was taking as long as humanly possible to not help
Американцы такие тупые. Он ждал ответа из под воды? Еще б пол часа поспрашивал есть ли там кто-то
I want to die peacefully in my sleep, but after being a funeral director for 30 yeah and have seen literally hundreds of ways a human can be snuffed out, I know the chances of that happening are pretty low. But I’m 56 with the immaturity of a five year old chimpanzee so I know me and my equally dumb friends ain’t leaving this world peacefully 😂
That poor little HERO, he was petrified but he still did what he needed to do to same his mother (I’m assuming it was his mother). Thank you @bhumphries1360 for commenting that she is ok. The only reason I’ve been scrolling and scrolling and SCROLLING was to find out. Thanks again.
For everyone questioning why the cop asked if anyone was in there, its because hes human. He was scared to go into that pond. The car could shift and crush him, he could drown somehow. The time it takes to ask that question again is much less than the time it takes to remove all that weight hes carrying. So he chose the 5 second delay instead of the 60 second delay...a solid choice. We are all still human.
What a waste of a cop. Tf took you so long? Why are you trying to enter from the drivers side and not the back windshield? Stop letting 60 year old fat out of shape people become officers
amen
OMG
Dear Jesus, please save this woman's life. Her children need her!  Thank you. 🙏😢
The man wearing the cam didn't seem to have wanted to actually save anybody. I mean sure, he did ultimately save her which should be all that counts but idk if you're a cop you and are expected to save people, you need to be saving everybody you can
RIP 😔
There are and always will be good policemen, a great bad apples does not spoil the whole bunch.
😢😢🙏🏾
“Not me SAVE THE GIRL!”
Thank you officer
The "is someoke in there?" Get your ass in that water dude the hell wasting time for ?
amen
The most delayed cop I’ve ever seen in my whole life is she in there like yes she’s in there she had a seizure she can’t call for help and yet you proceed to stand for about 30 seconds after every word that comes out of your mouth that’s a rap up just thx for the cop for saving her
Mom... help her😢
Typical female driving lol
Idc what nobody says he was nit being dramatic❤
Thank you sweet boy and daughter.  Thank you officer for your rescue....
Skittish cop ever
Thank you. I hope that poor boy is okay, he won't want to be away from her for a long time.
I feel bad for the kid. But the cop going is she in there. Bro he just told you she is having a seizure...
Why was she driving with children in the car when she has seizures. I find it hard to believe the kid would recognize a seizure if it wasn’t a common occurrence.
American police officers are terrible! They are not professional! Like little children! They are afraid of everything, take aim at everyone at once! Not the police, but the Scouts! They should be playing war games in kindergarten, not serving in the police!
White cop rescue black woman  Tell the truth !
WHY is someone with seizures ALLOWED To DRIVE?   That is so wrong.
Douche bag cop taking their sweet time because they don’t want to get wet literally pathetic
❤good🎉 God bless you 🙏
Why's she driving if she has seizures?
Dump ass cop.... The boy said there is ... She is in the water.... How come cop asking again n again lo
❤
Thank u bro, really.😮😮
My mother has sezuires also... she almost died in a car wreck also last year...
It was the boy's fault. He distracted her with his crying
Luv u guys.😂
Gracias a Dios que la han podido sacar.
Omg
I dunno... The boy repeatedly says his mum's in there and the white man is like "is somebody in there". Way to slow in a life and death situation. My body is saying he's low key racist. That boy was distressed and he was slow in rescuing his mum. I'd like to see the whole video.
Poor baby, he was so scared. I hope everyone is alright. This dude was takkng his time as if he didnt care.
Is somebody in there wtf kind of a stupid question is that, the kid told him that his mother was in there and that she had a seizure how the ffff is she gonna reply
Good men will be good men! Notice the cop read the pureness of that kid quick fast as a man. 100% truth in that kid. Told him to hop in like a dad or uncle and went to work!!
“Is she in there?” Like he didn’t want to get wet unless he had to. 🫤Texas is flat land in the middle of nowhere, and we all know how they are so it’s now she’s be knocking on random doors if she did.
Santo Santo Santo Padre Celestial Yeshúa Ha Mashiaj Sr Jesucristo Rey Celestial Rey Ntro
Hopegiklyvthey revived her. She wasnt moving
And I thank the police for running to his aid and rescuing that child mom.
A pergunta é, ' ela sobreviveu?'
Good ending but holding the dam camera could've cost her life, and does lil dude want it in his face in the scariest moment of his life?
Espero q tenha salvo a mamãe do garotinho
Os filhos muita das vezes vem para nossa vida para nos salvar ❤ pequeno herói ❤
See police officer who else would do that  god bless plz help the people we are with you
Y qué pasó qué videos tan ridículos cuando no sabes el final de una película igual
Não sei como uma pessoa pode querer filmar em vez de deixar as mãos  livre para agilizar o resgate 😢😢minutos pode definir a vida ou .......
I've seen a lot of bad cop vids here, but this one made my blood boil!  There was NO sense of urgency in that man's voice or actions!  That cop deserves a reprimand, not praise.  He was slow to respond to that child who was obviously in distress, WALKED to the car and stood on the side casually asking if someone was in a sinking car with that child screaming for his mother beside him.  WTF did he expect to get in response when that child TOLD HIM SHE HAD A SEIZURE.  Seldom seen such a blatant disregard for life.
Guys in slo mo. Speed the feck up.
Also God bless the good samaritan too.
Did she make it? Shouldnt be driving with siezues, great work saving mom!❤
God bless always this hero. Child will never forget this bad experience.  God bless him too.
тупит мусор жутко
*one of the best child in today's world, unlike many* , bless him n mama!!! 🙏🏾
Si no gravara podría sacarla más rápido 😢
😢Ребенок как выбрался сам?!?😮 Не понимаю...
What an idiot “is somebody in there”? Lmao you gotta be kidding me how stupid after somebody comes running up to you begging to save them
That cop took his damn time ... Calling for someone in a car under water 😂😂😂
Shouldn't be driving if you have that type of condition. Almost killed your kid and whoever else on the road. Crazy how were looking past the fact this could've been avoided. Whatever she needed to do was t more important than he child's life
As ignorant as I may sound and which I’m totally okay with it… I sometimes hate how cops do there job. I really really do.
A tip: if you go into the water hit the window button straight away (it may not work after being submerged) and then the seatbelt. Windows can be very hard to break by a would-be rescuer
Had a sub deral hematoma, passed out and hit a guard rail while my pup was in the car. Then when released had a seizure at my workplace (just shopping). The seizure was the scariest thing ive ever dealt with. By far. Hope she's okay, and that biy isnt traumatized...
The interior was not even underwater, so she didn’t die for drowning.  She had a seizure, but the car was not submerged.
That officer sure took his time, the little bot already made it clear that someone is in the car and it’s his mom
Man.... dude kid napped a woman and her kid, then crashed her car and faked this "Savior" video.... these millennials will do anything for attention or sympathy.  Shame.
Freaking government mandated vaxx....
The kid my mom had a seizure shes in the water the car sunk help her Cop is somebody in there Girl screams HELP HER Cop is somebody in there 😅😂
Why the fuckdid he ask if somebody was in there.
"Tell EMS step it up" as if we hadent already broken 3 dozen traffic laws while jamming out to music or trying to savor the last bit of hot spot food we just got 😂😂😂
“Is somebody in there!!” Tf u expect her to say underwater??
Bless that baby and mama! 😭
😳😭😭🙏🏾
And the police.. is some one in there?? Maybebif he saw bubbles coming out 😠 😡
Salute you young sir. 😢
He's not a good Samaritan hes doing his fkn job, and if you know the story, it's actually a fkn injustice to call a cop that in this situation. Insinuating that other cops wouldn't do the same
What do you mean is somebody in there??? Lmfao why are you guys praising a lazy ass cop that clearly stood still for 10 seconds and asking if someone is in a car under water 💀💀💀
Whats the outcome!!!?
sending love
Blessings 💞, just awesome and blessings that his Mom's life was saved......
And you Democrats who agree with the idiots about defund the police go tell that to this child
Good Samaritan, 🙏🙏🙏
How traumatizing that must’ve been for the child 😢 is she ok?
Black, white, brown, yellow or green Humanity needs you ❤
What happened? Why half video? Is she ok or she died?
That poor little boy
Why is she driving if she is prone to seizures?
Not the sharpest cop around, is he.
Wouaou ...
Dear Lord 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
This cop is dumb as shit and ive only seen 5 seconds of the clip.
That's precious baby he's so scared and frightened and is his mamas hero! Im so glad that man was there and ready to help .. it seems she had a seizure and ran off the road .
What do you mean get someone in there go in yourself and try to help the lady
La paciencia del tipo es increible
That's scary as  someone who has epilepsy and I've had a few while I was driving I'm so thankful I never ended up in this situation, although I did end up in a swamp once its so scary that boy was amazing
The cop did cpr to save her life she was on ventilator for 3 weeks following in icu she is now breathing on her own. She has two kids a son 12 and a daughter 16. All 3 people involved came together to save that woman’s life! So sad it is on the back of her young son as he experienced so much trauma that day and many days following I’m sure!!! Happy to know it was a positive outcome and thank God for placing the right people in the right path at the right time!!!
Certainly won’t see this on MSNBC
There's a joke somewhere about letting women drive. But i dropped it when i heard it was a seizure.
Th cop was being dumb if you're having a seizure you can't respond and he gonna ask is anybody in there after the kid said his mom was in there having a seizure
Камеры в лоб вживлены что ли? Ты руки освободи и людям помогай а не контент снимай. Тоесть парень бедит орет...а ты за телефон?
That guy is slow. "Is someone in there"   kid-"Mom! Help her!"
Praying for a speedy recovery ❤🙏🏾🙁
God bless 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 mother and child
Horrible film job
One thing is to keep calm… another is to take it easy in a emergency situation 👎
The kid managed to get out of the car!!👏🏼
Cops need better training... she said her mom in there....😂😂😮😮😮❤
Cop could have moved faster.
Is somebody in there? Helloo?? Anyone heerrre??
This cop was horrible I'm sorry but not having the equipment before he left the car knowing she was in the water to taking forever trying to open the door when it's common knowledge and sense the doors won't open because of pressure  He got on scene and still asked is someone in there and is she in there even after the frantic boy explains this already and probably said it multiple times on the way to the scene  Ultimately you can see someone else rescued her because as he said he's waiting on ems😢
❤❤❤
He could have helped faster. The phone is such a bad idea
Poor kid ..... God Bless you sweetheart.....
😢😮😢😢🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️👍
Thanks Jesus she's safe,  and thank you, officers.  God bless you all.
😮😢❤
The little boy was saying help my mom and to here him say is anybody in there.  SMH
What is the name of the movie?
Some people need to go back to school and review punctuations.
Everyone well bloody done! Love from scotland ❤😊
thanks to the police for helping. but if someone is under water and drowning he will not answer
God is faithful. A great loving son and an Angel of a man rescuer❤love and respect.
God Bless all three .. Glory be to God ❣️
White cop save colored lady. Colored.boy is the hero? Thanks jewtube
The cop wasn’t in a hurry
are the fish okay
It took them longer to assess situation/ get her out than it took me to graduate high school
OVERFUND THE POLICE!🤕
“DRAMATIC RESCUE “ WTH🤨🤨🤨🤦‍♂️
Mon Dieu aide cette femme. Et bravo à vous tous. 🙏🏿🙏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Thank GOD for caring people ❤❤❤
I am glad that she was rescued,  but was this her 1st seizure ever?  Because if she had them before, why was she driving? I have a friend who has epilepsy. Although she did not have a seizure for over a year, she is still not allowed to drive and will never will be. It is too dangerous.
Vielen lieben Dank an allen retter der Welt
Cop just pissed me off. The boy said his mom is in the sinking car, cop stands there and yells “ is somebody in there?” He didn’t want to save that lady, the other guy did!
You see the police are here to serve.
This is exactly why people with seizures should never operate vehicles your put not just yourself at danger but everyone around you
This video with the big " goodbey im leaving" clickbeat is a good lesson for me
This is what good cops should be like. Willing to help and doing their best despite all odds to make it happen. Thank you Mr Cop.
Why do they hire the dumbest people to be cops?
God bless him
💔
Is the car unlocked ☺️?
Thank you to the rescuer's & good job to you too little man 🙏🏽
I thought that was the replacement Liam for Shameless
This police... Is no help
typical charger owner
That poor boy explained it clear and concisely since time was of the essence,  but goober needed it spelled out on a billboard it seems.
OMG. that poor kid is scared! I hope his mom was ok.
God be a shield.     God bless the officer and the good Samaritan.     The young child was sooo brave, cause I know this was scary as hell for him
Cảnh sát chậm chạm và dỡ thế 🤔 . Trường hợp này không phảnh nhanh tay chân để cứu người ư  . Đó là lý do cảnh sát này không thể vào đội cứu hộ và cứu hoả 🤔. Tôi ngưỡng mộ những lính cứu hoả và cứu hộ . Cũng có một số cảnh sát rất đỉnh 😊
Il faut filmer avant tout c'est important... Courage loulou j'espère que ta maman ira mieux
I suppose that's commendable. Having said that I'm not a cop and would have not only been a shit load faster but infinitely more decisive. Honestly, I'm surprised the cop didn't get the poor kid to fill out a form before he entered the water.
Cop is so slow and filming 😏🤨
Why she driving with her boy in the car when she had seizures . Please , Mam , don't do that to your dear child again.   What a horror for everybody else . Glad you're okay but STOP being irresponsible !
Jesus
😢😢😢😢
This boy is a strong man!!
Bravooooooo Zotni!👏👏👏👏👏✝️🇦🇱🌷
What happened were they able to save her
Could this cop be any less urgent... fucking really man.
Just one thing tho the cop was in no rush at all trying to help her
dude really took his fucking time
Omg I’m so terrible cz I wouldn’t think twice , ide fly to the car to help , it’s human nature to help ! But the key is to stay calm like the copper
Oh wow! Thank the Lord for decent cops & decent people. Bless you all ❤
Oviously this was staged i mean who goes under water with a camera or phone,mxm, the things pple do for view
Dudes acting way too slow tf
😢
🫶🏻🙌🏻🙏🏻
Is someone in there what a stupid question when the kid is screaming his mom is in there
Dios lo bendiga, también al policía y a su mamá.Espero esté bien.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
OMG this just made me panic 😮😮😮. I pray they got her out 😢😢😢
That's a hell of a dramatic rescue. That dang water slows EVERYTHING down. I can't imagine the desperation of everyone involved.
Omg this is so scary. I just started having seizures about 5 months ago. A few a week. My son wanted me to take him somewhere today and I felt bad say no. We live in the country around a lot of irritation canals and narrow roads. I don’t feel bad for saying no I’m scared to drive now.  This baby screaming for help made me cry and his mom is completely unaware and could have drowned and he had to watch. He’s probably gonna be traumatized.  I really feel like it was meant for me to see this so I won’t drive. 😮😩😭
This cop doesn’t care … this video makes me sick
Dios Bendiga ese senor !
"Is somebody in there??" Like as if they're gonna be able to respond back. 😒🙄
Ce que je ne comprends pas bien, c'est pourquoi les sauveteurs perdent du temps à essayer désespérément d'ouvrir les portes au lieu de casser la vitre du coffre? En tout cas je lis que cette dame va bien et se rétablie. C'est en soit un miracle, la pauvre. Ce n'était pas son heure. Quant fiston.. il  à été son ange gardien. Bravo à lui pour sa débrouillardise et courage.❤
😢😢❤❤❤❤
I know the caption says they saved her but can anyone please verify that this poor little boys mom did in fact survive?😢
The cop barely wanted to help didn’t show any emotion
And this is why youre not allowed to drive if you have seizures.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Que desesperante situación 😢
The child was his mom’s #1 rescuer/hero
Handbrake cop😂😂
Praise the Lord ! 😢 im happy he didn't wait for an answer !
God bless that child. Poor thing
Cop sounded like he didn’t want to do his job
Cop was waaay too slow
He just said his mom sunk and she was having a seizure...
Little dude made it out the car after the accident made it to land flagged down help and saved his mom. Young soldier 💯💯
why did it take a minute for a cop to go in there?
Kid: "MY MOM IS IN THE CAR HELP HER!" COP: "is somebody in there?"   No shes sitting at home :)
Is she in there is the car unlocked stupid questions should've broke the window
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
people don’t put the phone down to save her with both hands😐
❤🙏❤
This is great, but why the questions and delayed actions from the cop? Just jump in and get to work bro! I once spotted a car 12ft in a ditch under a roadway bridge. It’s a long story, but when I actually discovered the car I turned back to the officer that I had earlier called out (after noticing the traffic lights were out and people were flying through the intersection at 230am) and said there’s a car down here with someone in it. Cop asks me to check the car and asks if they are alive. I’m thinking I’m a 21 year old kid, shouldn’t you be doing this? Anyway I check the car, find the man is dead. Apparently he was 64, had a heart attack, drive through a transformer, jumped 3 curbs, broke the old wooden guard rails, did a 180 and landed in the ditch. Had I not called the police for the traffic light and walked to the median to talk to the police when he arrived, that car likely would have gone unseen atleast until someone was sent to fix the transformer or guardrail whenever that would have been noticed. Took 4 hours to get the car out with a crane. But the weird part was the guy looked like he was just asleep sitting up, with a newspaper open across the steering wheel.
And there are still people who says ACAB..
Not only did this boy have to free himself from a sinking car, he had to swim out and run as fast as his little body could to find someone to help get his mom help. I can't even imagine what this boy went through in that moment and how much it took to suppress all his emotions to save his mom. He is such a brave young man! 😢
Is she in their, is somebody in their what a waste of time fool just go in quick and get them out u fucking bullshit
The cop going to say is someone in there when the officer knows that someone is in inside the car smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Why are you posting some like this for views?
That police officer is lucky, he showed no urgency and she could have easily been drowning. Was like he didn’t want to get wet !!   The kid is already at the window saying save my mum and he keeps asking is she in there …..why else is the kid back in the water next to a crashed car…dumb
Is it just me or was the officer moving to slowly when every millisecond counted
Amen Brother's and Sister's 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dude his ass needs to be fired!!! How tf is he gonna just stand there at the freakin edge of the water and scream to the boy is there anyone in there as the car is sinking in front of him as he's yelling mama and to help her,, then asks if the car is unlocked as he finally walks nonchalantly out to finally get that woman out of her car!!!! This blows my freaking mind!!! The nerve of some ppl is absolutely ridiculous!!!
How tf you a good Samaritan when its your job and he took to fkn long
Надеюсь, что все закончилось хорошо
Now that’s what cops soposto act like hood job bro hope the woman is ok
Yo no sé cómo el no llevo alguna herramienta de hierro para abrir alguna ventana , si le aviso que estaba en el agua!
Pobrecito niño Esas personas se k es difícil su enfermedad pero no deberian andar solas y menos manejando tristemente tuvieron ese accidente y gracias a Dios los pudieron ayudarlos a tiempo, deseo ya esten mejor
Wie man sieht........sieht man nix......
WHAT ANGEL SHE HAS OMG ❤❤❤
Omg. I. Glad the kid got out, man...that's tough. Good for Lil man, good on all of them. Hope they are all doing good.
God is so good. Thank God for her brave son and that brave officer 💪✊️🫡🙏🙌❤️💯
Thank you God for your Guidance for this young boy and Police Officer! Thank you for helping Mom recover. Please God Bless and Protect this Family! 🙏🙏🙏
Lord i would’ve been so scared to get in that water. I have a real fear of bodies of water that I cannot see through and this would’ve been a real test of my weakness because you can tell the boy was sure his mom was going to die in that water hadn’t someone went after her.
A very lucky woman..sounds awful but she had her .kids and cop saving her life..how grateful she will be
He doesn't want to leave his camera
Thank God help came in time!!! How scary 😢
Lawd what the heck 😮
Is the car unlocked is crazy to me 😂 not a funny situation at all just made me bust out laughing though  is the car unlocked? the car is submerged underwater whether is locked or not you gotta break the window
That poor boy 😢
Damn could that officer move any slower at the start
the policeman how he thought about getting into water
The cop not believing the kid and rushing in there immediately is terrible.
🙏🏽
I know what that child feels I know my kids and wife do too because I suffer from epileptic seizures and this happened to me
Thank god she was saved.😌
Must be the cops first day or he's a few fries short of a happy meal. First of all the kid is screaming for help and then when the cop sees the car, he is still  not convinced that somebody's in there?! A civilian would have reacted faster than this clown and would have probably known to bust out the back window!
These is what gives me faith in humanity
Why was the cop going so slow?
can’t believe this cops hesitation. 🤮
Sometimes i think the cops in the US are such idiots , wasting time unnecessarily , man that kid was already saying that his mom is inside the car and the cop still asking the person inside as if she could reply 😒 seriously !   And  the poor lady was suffocatng inside , lol cops , if it was a bit late then she could have died !
🙏🙏🙏
Que paso con la mamá?😢😢
Is somebody in there? …. Man!!! He told you his MOM was there!!! 🙄🙄🙄slow as F!
Thank you Lord Jesus 🙏🙌😭😭
In the cop asking if someone is in there maybe that was his nerves not sure but clearly he said his mom was in there.
“She’s in the water in the car”  Cop: “is someone in there?”  No way we overpay these geniuses for this quality work 😂
So happy he was able to get her help, people who suffer from seizures really shouldn't drive especially with their children. If she's epileptic she's been told that and I'm sorry this happened but she shouldn't put herself or her children or others on the road in danger. I'm glad she made it through again but this was said so that if you know someone who is epileptic or suffers from seizures that we would encourage them not to drive. ❣️
😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Instead of asking STUPID fucking questions how about u get ur ass in there and help smh
Murzyn ha ha ha ha muuuuurzyn
ASKING THEM ... DUMM ASS QUESTIONS😐
Praise God! God bless her, her son and the rescuers.
Thank you very much 🙏
Shout out to the cops
Praise God
How did the woman end up in the water? How did the kid get out but mother could not
GREAT JOB 👍ALL AROUND🙏 I HOPE SHE'S OK. MY PRAYERS 🙏ARE WITH THE FAMILY.
She was drinking and driving
Bless his heart praise God 👏
😢😢
Fucking crazy 😮
Who would have a camera ready for an emergency like that??  I hope she is okay!! 😮
Had me holding my breath trying to help.. Thank you LORD JESUS for sending this man! I pray GOD bless both families!
Oh her baby boy...my god..he was just so scared poor baby
God is good!! God is Good!! ❤
The dumb ass cop standing there eating precious time “is anyone in there” while the boy just told you she was having a seizure?!?!?!
Anyone else beyond frustrated with this officer's lack of urgency? Just in case you're thinking about equating "urgency" with "panic," _don't!_
Yeah this cop is an idiot.
"Is somebody in there?"  No it's one of those fuckin self crashing cars you heard about on the teevee
Suddenly they need a cop
WTF is he so slow?!
Why this police moving at a turtle pace? Geez!
walk any slower???
The little boy getting in the water to elbow to the window brought tears to my eyes 😭
Is thus froma movie or it is for real
Could the cop be any slower
The fear in that poor boys eyes is just heartbreaking.. what an incredibly brave young boy xx
Useless cop dammit!!! 🤬 So exasperating “🤡 is someone in there?” When she had a seizure and is underwater 🤦🏻‍♀️
That's what cops do in TEXAS❤
The kid: "She's in the water"  *Most of the car is in the water*  The cop: "iS sOmEbOdY iN tHeRe?" 🤦🏿
🙏 AMEN 🙏
This boy is the mom’s superhero! 🙏🏽🦋
This guy moving so slow asking questions
Why did he scream are you in there?? The son said she was in there, crazy
¡¡QUE MOMENTO HORRIBLEEEEEE!!!
🥺🥺🙏🏻
Thank God that she was saved. That poor kid
Dumb ? Is somebody in there?  Is the car unlocked? Just get there and get her out. That boy just broke my heart
Pauvre petit  … merci 🙏🏽aux policiers qui on secouru la maman
He just happened to have a waterproof GoPro with him. What are the odds?
What a brave lil hero!!!! Saving his mom!!!
God bless him and his memories of this horrible accident❤😢😢
Got to give it up to the officer , for going in to get here, her child was so terrified
"iS sOmEbOdY iN tHeRe"
Boy: she having a seizure Cop: is she in their  Ummm No shit
Is mom ok?
Omg
Cop doing the bare minimum to assist
What  a brave young boy trying to get help mom, whose plunge in the river , I think 🤔 I hear young boy said his mother is having a seizure. The police officer went to help the mother to get her out the water to save her from drowning.
Wow, this patriarchy
She should not have been driving
Take your sweet time officer 🙄😡
God bless everyone... Ameen Ameen Ameen
I hope shes ok. Side note this kid looks just like Christian Isaiah from Shameless
Little boy is the MVP. Clear and concise information with urgency and authority, bravo. 👏
Kids. Always love mom and dad
I am happy they rescued her but curious question I thought people who have seizures werent able to drive?
And in other news, recently saw something where people with narcolepsy or seizure prone were commenting on a vid, "oh, I've only had one episode behind the wheel. I'm totally fine to drive!"
Appreciate your local hero, most of them will be there when you need help risking their lives.
Porque no Ivan corriendo 😢
Não dá pra entender nada, filmaram ,de qualquer jeito,tudo tremido
That random guy that stopped to help need to be a police officer that's a kind brave soul
Thank God God is good❤
I looked it up, and this lady survived. They pulled her up on the bank and did CPR until she started spitting up water and eventually regained consciousness.
TWO fabulous heroes!!!❤❤❤❤
She's having a seizure, she's sunk followed by cries 🥺🥺🥺🥺 fking broke me in one second. Im a caretaker and deal with ppl with seizures all the time, and this was just the worst
That man moved slower than shit
Shouldn’t be driving if you know you have seizures 💀
This poor boy. Oh my god, my heart goes out to him.
😭😭😭
"Help!" *Splash splash* "Help!"  Officer: "is somebody in there? 🧐"
I'm so glad that she's going to be ok. But does she have epilepsy? People with epilepsy shouldn't drive at all.
Okay but why u need to make a Instagram Story about that, Just let Ur Phone in Pocket
RIP to her
Comment elle a pu en arriver là encore quelqu’un qui savait pas conduire
This cup take his time. If this woman will come out by herself, he will taser her for siour
Poor kid😢
What an amazing officer. If that little boy ends up working in law enforcement...this officer is the reason.
The good ones risk their lifes n the bads ones does alot of stunts
why is he dilly dallying while there is literally a car under water and a boy is screaming that his mom is inside💀
Anyone know if the mom made it?
Thank You
🙏🏼🙏🏼
People with a history of seizures shouldn’t be driving. She put her kids life and her own at risk! Very dangerous. Luckily everyone was okay and survived 🙏🏽
Could he react a little more slower
What a horrible thing for this lil boy to go through watching his mom stuck in a car that’s under water it must have been terrifying for everyone involved especially the mom stuck in the car ❤❤❤
What a kid!! That little man saved his mom’s life, quick on his feet and to think, way to go kid!!!
❤❤❤❤❤😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
God bless 🙏🏾
❤❤God Bless you sir ❤❤
Props to the kids. That cop was asking Austin's wasting time. He was scared
Poor kid man can't imagine what he was going thru and can't believe he got lucky enough to find s cop out at the rd
Kid - she's having a seizure, she sunk she's in the water  Guy - common hop in.  Is she in there?  Is somebody in there? 🤦
This is representative of our men and women in blue. They don't hesitate to rush in to help whether it's an accident, health issue, or crime in progress. Their own safety is secondary to the person they're trying to help. When a incident arises where a subject is being violent towards those in the community, themselves, or our officers those officers, in a majority of cases, have mere seconds to make life and death decisons. At the very least our officers deserve the benefit of the doubt not the nonsensical Democrat propaganda aimed at not only defunding police depts but also demonizing our officers. A simple thank you is more appropriate. At this stage it would be nice if they acknowledged their divisive rhetoric has resulted in a severe drop in new applicants and a rash of retirments/career changes. Departments running on low numbers of officers result in the community being subjected to higher rates of crime as evidenced by the astronomical jump in crime.
Help gurgle gurgle.....is somebody in thurr?
Great son!!!!!!
Thank  God he was there to save her
Why is the cop walking up asking if someone's inside?? You got directed there for a reason
Bro that cop is so fucking slow ong
Cops asking the kid a million questions what’s her astrological sign?
In Jesus Name Amen 🙏
That cop couldn't possibly move any slower.
Kid hero❤ Cop hero❤️
❤
Cant see any thing ? Flunk
Poor baby! 😢
Meu Deus der a saúde dela?
This is another example of the things officers do that don't make the main stream media. The courage of the little boy was amazing. God bless him. Praying for the mom.,🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
why do they issue licenses to epileptics? very sad
Is there someone in there? Jesus Christ… OBVIOUSLY.
Obrigada ho CRIADOR DO CEU E DA TERRA
I hate that he didn’t move with authority!!!
Prayers up
Looks like there was no real urgency with the cop good thing the Samaritan was there. Based off this video he was the one who really saved the woman
Good 👍👍 Samaritan and awesome young man
God bless this brave little boy and his Mother😢🙏🏾
Não deu p/ ver nada ! 😮
Looks like the siezure is the least of her problems right now. Probably would have been good to lead off by mentioning her being trapped in a submerged vehicle. But she is just a kid and she was doing her best. Poor kid
Why the American police ask so many questions before they actually go out for help????
We need more heroes like him.
Did they get her. I hate short younnever get the end .
I hate how lax the officer is about the situation
Omg how horrible that boy is forever traumatized heart breaking 🥺😢💔
Good Samaritan Cop? Protect and Serve... Its hos job not any option.. fix your title. Glad he was there. Hope he got there in time..
If the good Samaritan wasn't handling it, the cop would still be standing there asking questions...
Bro asks if anyone is in the car like anyone in a submerged vehicle is going to answer
Is the car unlocked? Cuz maybe I need to clock out of my shift if it isnt.
This is terrible 🥺. Thank goodness there was no gators in there
Пацан,наверно бежал на помощь,устал очень.
Cop had zero urgency, pissed me off
🙏🏻
It's mind boggling how the cop shows no urgency. A car 3/4 submerged and he's calling is somebody in there.
Good job saving this lady. But if she is knows she has seizures she is not supposed to be driving. They usually take your license just for this reason, until you haven't had a seizure for at least one year.
Dios todo poderoso que todo salga bien padre celestial misericordia para esta madre el niño hermoso salvando a su madre Díos lo proteja siempre
Sorry but wtf 🤔 the complete LACK of urgency from the cop paired with the lil boys desperation coupled with the fact that the cop just stood on the bank watching the car sink and only made a real attempt to save them when there was ALREADY SOMEBODY in the water trying was infuriating. Everything about this clip is rage bait
You had to ask again when you got there did you really think it was a set up Jesus?
That cop was taking his sweet time and that kid saw it
"Is anyone in there?" Really?
Whyyyyyy would he ask if some is in there ????? Yes dude ... His momma is
God Bless that police officer. God bless that family I hope the mother is safe and sound.
Oh that poor baby 😭 my heart broke for him for how scared but brave he was.
“Is somebody in there”, that man jus told you his mama was in there
The way my heart just hurted for him 🥺 but he was very brave & got help ❤
ALMIGHTY GOD THANK YOU*GOD HAD THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN PLACE 🙏 🙏
What a brave boy❤
Did this person ask is  somebody in there? And the second question is worse..is the car unlock? Wtf what's next? Are you dead?
🙏
I can't imagine this kid finding a female cop to help.  I think he would have lost his mind.
Dumb ass cop had zero concern
Thank u Jesus
Thank you God and thank those men..❤
God bless the police man and this family. Brave courageous child. Thank God for saving that child's mother. 🙌🙌🙌
THANK YOU😢
Bless him
I bet that cop would move faster if it was his family member
Thank you Officer.
OMG that baby crying got me
Did she live???
Heros!
That cop hollering like he waiting for his mom to answer back. That cop taking his time.
This broke my heart when I seen it .. him crying out for help for his mother God bless him hopefully she is okay
God bless
Real life heros. Thankyou Jesus she got help.
Were calling cops doing their job good samaritans now? Didn't have any sense of urgency in the beginning either.
Very painful to see this kind of thing!!  😞
This baby had pure terror and fear in his eyes yet articulated clearly his mumma is in trouble....What a smart young man. Well done for saving mumma❤
god bless them ❤ I hope the others see who really helped instead of dissing cops like most do 😢
Brave boy. Dear heavenly father, God, please always protect this boy and continue to give him courage and wisdom to know what to do in emergencies. In Jesus' name, AMEN. Sending love to you, dear child. ❤❤❤
Vous les avez sauvées !profond respect à vous ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
As someone who has a mother with epilepsy I too understand the pain it comes with. My heart goes out to them
I wanna know if the lady was ok !!
Officer just took his sweet time smh
Wow. That's all I can say. Little angel. Even God hear your cry son.❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Allahu Akbar Kabiro
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Why did it take the cop so long
God bless that young man and  officer for their bravery in a pretty scary situation. Keeping their cool and reacting quickly saved the day! ❤
Hey man don’t react any slower.  The kid is pointing at the car screaming and you ask if someone is in there.  He says my mom.  You then ask again is she in the car?
Ugh that broke my heart, poor sweet baby saved his mamas life ❤
Aw poor baby hope all it well
Is the childs mom ok ?  This is upsetting
We knew how this panned out.Did the mother survive as she?Okay I hope so sending prayers
“Is the car unlocked” lol go check bro
Thank you, officer. May God richly bless you.
This cop was so slow to act and had a horrible grasp on the situation. I'm sorry but he could have costed her her life wasting time asking stupid questions like "is someone in there" and "is the door unlocked" after he was given all the information he needed. Idk if it's complacency or stupidity, but he seems to be more of a liability than a help.  Like, I'm glad he was there and they got her out. But for the love of God, some expediency should be a given here.
How tf does that even happen?
OMG! Pray she was ok!🙏🏽
She looked pretty dead to me?
He wasn't in no rush at the beginning sheeshhh. Get some motivation in ya step lol
LO BUENO QUE EL NIÑO LOGRO SALIR DEL CARRO Y PEDIR AYUDA!!! POBRE BEBÉ 😢😢😢
He’s a hero
Gators??😮
Why does he ask twice, if somebody was in there! Just go help! Lost important seconds there!
Great kid, he’s freaking out but he’s able to find help and get the point across
Thank God for the boy’s bravery and the wonderful Good Samaritan. 🙏🏾💯🙏🏾
Poor little boy 😢 Mums little hero ❤😇
Sir ❤the God  loves you just saving another person ❤
I'm thinking David is guilty. Its just too coincidental that his wife was going to leave him that night.   But I also wondered about the other guy's DNA on the kids. If David had his sweatshirt, he could have transferred DNA. But I missed the part of how David got his sweatshirt. Did the other guy leave it there by accident?   Also, I'm always leery about someone who lies, and the other guy changed his story like five times, so IDK. It's a crazy story.
Thank you sir ❤🦾🙏
The police: is somebody is there 😢
“My mom help her”…  broke me 🥹❤
Em vez de filmar ajude rápido 😢
💥💥💥💥💚
Thank God that he was able to save her and thank God that baby wasn't hurt😢❤
Bless you, sir, for your efforts ❤
Esta mujer tubo, mucha suerte, con su hijo, con el o los que la rescataron, y le dieron RCP. Gracias a ellos, aún no era su hora!  Felicitaciones por el deber cumplido, Dios los bendiga 🙏🏻😊❤
🙏
Thank you Lord for answering this baby’s prayer for help for his Mother.
Glad they saved her, but damn that cop was slow, wasting precious time asking questions he already had the answers too.
i remember when i got into an accident last year and lost my mom a month later from it. i definitely get the panic of it all
Mopar = cant swim = natural selection...
First he said it was his sister and then he said it was his mom... I'm surprised the cop didn't double mag dump the car for good measure.
He wasn’t moving very fast tho 🤔 “IS THE CAR UNLOCKED” really brah 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
God bless for that little little boy you saved that woman's life God bless him and God bless the man
The kid said the mom having a seizure
Bless his heart. Did his mom make it? So traggic and tramatic.
Back windshield buddy!!
Thank you!❤❤❤
That baby immediately brought tears what an incredibly brave boy ❤and so thankful for every9ne who could help his mom
This has gotta be the slowest cop in existence.  wtf.     Every second matters in this situation.    wtf.
No if her man see this he will not let her drive his car nomo
Prayers😢
And thats why people with seizures shouldn't drive 🤦‍♂️
And he asked....is the car unlocked.... totally don't like this 😮😮
❤❤❤❤❤
When I heard that country accent and hop in I knew they were in good hands.
Thank you God for these brave folks .
The mom had a seizure while driving her two children. The boy went for help while the daughter tried to wake the mom. The cop & a couple Samaritans helped break the back window causing the vehicle to go under. Someone grabbed the mom out & they did CPR. She’s finally breathing on her own & recovering. They did well. For the comments about the Officer being cautious at first.. it irritated me aswell at first but he has to protect himself too. This entire rescue was AMAZING!!
Christ Almighty, don't play 20 questions, GET IN THERE.
Help stop talking damn 🤬
Exelente labor del policia y la valentia del niño de pedir esa alluda para su madre
Omg
God bless
😭😭😢😢🙀🙀🙀😿😿😿
How many people thought of iRobot?
Everybody rwsponds differently in emergency situations. It's  called fight or flight some people are naturally born rescuers  and will approach situations without thinking. Some freeze and get flustered. Sometimes it's  a collecrive effort for a successful  outxome of situations.
It is sooo great to see an officer protect and serve ! This video is heart warming and faith-restoring !!! More of these Supermen (and Superwomen) please !
👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏
Father God i c😊ome to you to pray for this woman and a miraculous healong from you Lord Jesus. You gave her to her courageous son and now its time Jesus to wake her up. I'm  asking in your Jesus to heal her 100%. In the mighty name of Jesus. Amen
THIS CHILD TO ME IS ANGEL OF GOD HOLY SPIRITUAL POWER OF THE DIVINE LOVE OF GOD HOLY MAY THEY BOTH BE IN THE HANDS OF GOD WELL IN MY PRAYERS I KEPT SAYS JESUS JESUS JESUS CRISTO AMEN 🙏 🙌 ❤️
Thank you there are still good people in this world. ❤
Mil bendiciones jesucristo te bendiga ❤❤❤
El niño desesperado pidiendo ayuda y estos hombres con su lentitud y todavía grabando.
Thank you so much, Officer of the Law 🙏🏿
Gracias 😮😮😮😢
Bravo la police !!❤❤❤
WOW
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Kid has amazing presence of mind...
@bhumphries1360 YOU ARE THE MVC!!! Thank you.
"She's in the car, she's having seizures" then policeman proceed to as, "Is somebody in there?"
Não se vê nada... 👎👎👎👎👎🤔🤔🤔
Alright we’res the person that’s still gonna manage to hate the cop
All cops aren't bad after all...
why TF is he shouting is someone in there? he already told him there was. u think shes gonna shout underwater??? Hes wasting time!
All praise to Ahayah🙌🏽
That just about broke my heart hearing that baby asking them to help his mommy. Hope she is okay.
Thank you to the little boy and dedicated officers...We need more men and women like you..❤
Damn that cop is wasting time asking stupid questions.
"she can't park there!"
If she has  seizures why the hell is she driving?
POR LO MENOS PODRIA SER MAS RAPIDOOOOO
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢
Tell EMS to step it up while he was walking
She’s black we don’t care
What i see is a cop wasting time and being reluctant to jump into action while a citizen gets the job done.
Hope the $ from this is helping the Mom and Son!  Just saying. You know that car ain't 💯 covered.
Poor baby 😢
I hope the rescued her and she is okay
What a poised young man. I bet you he grows up and is in the medical field in some way. Great job by the young man, and officer.
Oh God help!!!
Thank You Jesus and thank you officers!
This is what they won't show about cops
This broke my heart for this kid. So glad he got help in time.
That cop was an idiot at first. Is somebody in there ? Dude the kid just told yes his mom’s in there . Felt like eternity before he did something just Glad God gave a miracle that day and saved her
🙏🏽
Could the cop have moved any slower?
I’m from that area
🙏🏼🙌🏼bless her
Bless u young man and those that helped her!
Hope she’s ok🙏🏼❤️
Cop is on the spectrum or something. Like bruh you don’t have all day. Slow af
If that was my mum, I would be swimming 🏊‍♂️ ,   Maybe the kid has autism
I see this and thankful for the 👮‍♀️
God definitely saved them the fact he even got out so he could find help😭
Más bien es, gracias a dios.
Cop was sure taking his sweet ass time
Poor car.
Porque não coloca nos comentários em português Brasil a gente não entende nada
Asking dumbass questions as seconds tick by. Smh
Oh this poor little boy! I hope she was ok 🙏
Idiot cop asking if someone's in there? WTF
God bless them for saving her. Oh God help her recover, and worship you... in Jesus' name 🙏
Thank you Mr. Officer
You spelled kid wrong. Kid is not spelled c o p. The cop didn't want to get wet. The kid saved his momma
finally we see them saving someone
Cop literally didn’t do shit. “Is there somebody in there?” Noooo, kid is wet and crying and no visible adult around with a submerged vehicle in the water. What a joke. GO GET SOME TRAINING!
THANK  YOU GOD
God bless his little heart and love for his momma! Thank God for everyone who helped save his momma and this little boys lifestyle too!🤗🤗🤗🤗👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️
😢
This kid baby boy was stressed  I hope his momma was ok
😢😢
🙏♥️🙌
❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
“Is somebody in there”  Ughhhh
Dios pobre niño
Is someone in there? She underwater bro and she sure ain't aquaman.
So did the officer expect to hear the boys mom to yell out “yes I’m in here trapped in the car under water”…. Like tf?
Are the doors locked......really?  Try it.
He has no sense of urgency the cop
Good Samaritan cop? Not downplaying things, but this is more of a first responder being at the right place at exactly the right time
Wow this broke my heart the look on his face.
is SomBody in there 🤨
Sorry I got mad too fast . He sitting there looking at the car asking if someone in there 😂 yea dude someone in there drowning ! Hesitation kills
😢😢 thanks for the Good Samaritan
This should be all over the news instead the continue to divide us with the hate eachother tactic ! That every race is “bad” to eachother
By seeing all this he is asking "IS SOMEBODY IN THERE"😢
😢😢😢❤😮
I hope all this is true, but I have my doubts that this woman survived. She must have been under warm water for many minutes.  The officer seemed to be wasting precious seconds asked unless questions as well.
The cop was so calm when he said: “Hello is somebody in there??!!” I mean that boy already told him that his mom was inside the car!
God bless everyone in this video ❤❤❤
Good job kid, you saved your momma. And good on the officers for stepping in and helping her out.
What a miracle. I hope that mother celebrates life with her son.
All I could think of was Michael following his GPS. Thank the lord everyone was okay.
Cop just takes his time
Poor brave child 😭😭😭😭
This kid is the hero dude ! ❤
I 🙏 🙏 🙏 shes gonna be ok😢poor little boy!!!!  U were a big help little man!!!! HERO❤
Terrible reaction time… Get moving!!!
😭🙌🏻🥳
Her guardian angel saved his mom. ❤️✝️🙏 Thank God 🙏
“Is somebody in there?” Is he hard of hearing? The boy told him a few times his mom was in the water 🤦‍♀️
❤❤❤
😢😢
Cop had no urgency. Just knew he was being watched
The child was amazing at going to get help for his mom 😢😢😮.  Thank the officer and the EMS people for saving the women life because most of them would not have believed the boy.😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
THIS IS THE KIND OF POLICE I REMEMBER GROWING UP.... NOT THIS US VS THEM=COP THUG LIFE
😳😐😢😢💪🏽💪🏽
I was going to subscribe, but this video left me hanging I don't know if that woman is okay and there's no follow-up video so... More videos where I don't know the ending is something I can't deal with
God bless them and thank God for her son
❤❤❤
Our Father God and also the baby boy saved this lady 🙌🏼
I love that dewd good son
Gracias a Dios !!!! Pudo salvarla !!!!! Bendiciones Eternas para el Rescatista !!!!¡
Thank God they saved her life. My heart goes out to those kids ...
Good job office  you're not human you're an angel bless you ❤️.
🥺
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I never would have thought I would approve of telling a child to jump in a stranger's car. But Lord have mercy, I thank you, Mr. Kind Man for telling that boy to jump in the car and you  set off to save his mama! Thank you a million times and more. And yes I'm crying and I don't care who sees or knows that I'm crying for thankfulness and gratitude. Sir, you are the child's hero ❣️ and son you and that man is your mother's hero. And all of y'all together are a demonstration of the Lord's work!!!!!!🌹🙏🏾
This made this 49 year old dad 😢, cry his eyes out!
The person already was in the water helping the mother. Not the cop he was to busy asking questions while the mom was under water dying
God bless this young man for loving his mom that much! And thank God for good cops and good people! 👏👏👏
Taking his sweet ass time, act ask questions later
Gracias por decir que se recupera❤
Praise Father God and Jesus Christ all glory to Father God and Jesus Christ
Dios bendiga a los baloentes de buena voluntad que hicieron misericordia con la mujer, atendiendo a la peticion del niño.
This officer needs more training tf he asking if the door is unlock ? And after being told that his mom is in there he still ask if there somebody in there 😂 he need more awareness
Doesn’t tell a thing! Shame on you!! 🤬
“She’s in there she’s in there” Cop to a car that is literally underwater: “is anyone in there?”  Are you kidding me bro
A white man. Go figure. Bet she'll change how she sees white people. When your life is on the line, humans do what humans do. We're all the same.
How many times does the poor boy have to tell him to help the person.. smh just get in there man, every second counts.. literally
The cop just casuly takes his time walking to the car. Uhh hey guys hold my cellphone so it don't get wet.
Credit the boy for getting help asap and not panicking…
Oh that poor, sweet precious baby. 🥺💕
horrifying
The police nowadays would see this kid and go, "Give me like thirty minutes. I'm on my lunch break."
Thank you Jesus
THANK YOU FOR HELPING THAT POOR CHILD ❤
Bro Liam got it bad all ways :(
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Seizure and in the water? Survival seems very low.
Ich Hoffe die mutter gehts gut!😢❤
“Is somebody in there” 🤦‍♀️obviously
I’m confused why we’re acting like this is an amazing response? I saw this cop leisurely stroll up to the scene, stand there, and then slowly wade into the water.
"Is she in there", wtf is that response he just said she in the water and having a seizure go stop asking question and go
He doesn't sound like he's in a hurry
❤👼👼👼👼👼👼👼❤
Thank you  for helping
Awesome job to the young man that saved his mom❤
could that cop move any slower and any more nonchallant????
🎉fake ...
THANK YOU,  THANK YOU,  THANK YOU,❤❤
What a disgusting video. Absolutely no urgency from this cop at all.
women cant drive frfr
Wow that cop was really moving
Oh my lord. Thank God they where there to help rescue the Mom
Thank you, Lord. For her son and the men that Helped them.  Thank you for the update ❤
God bless these
Remember...GOD said HE AIN'T GOIN NOWHERE 🙏🏾
Thank you Jesus! Jehovah Raphe, God our healer rest here, in Jesus almighty name, amen and amen!
Omg omg omg was she alive ? I hope he didn’t lose his mother
Bless this baby. He literally saved his momma ❤❤❤ I pray she's okay❤
🙏🙏🙏
Is somebody in there? Naw what do you think, sir?🙄
😮
😂

L
May God really heal all epileptic persons I hate seizures as much as I hate cancer God have mercy😢😢😢😢😢💔
Cop so lame while bro panicking saying help her my moms in there n the cop just gone sit there lookin stupid keep saying it

Gator food
I take my hat off lil man. You got some help brave
Лицо мальчика крайне сильно похоже на актера, который играл роль Лиама в сериале "Бесстыжие" 🤔
Brave kid 😮
Praise God Life can end at any moment  Repent trust in Christ don’t die in your sins
That beautiful little boy. My heart. Thank you Jesus the one who saves ❤
❤
Good man that helped that childs momma  right there. I hope everyone is ok
The policeman is asking which question just do your job help out and you find out who is inside hello
Back window!
That police officer who asked if someone was in there was so dumb like how are u going to ask if someone’s in there when u know they can’t answer u because there under the water  Like u need to think better and harder next time.
This kid is a super hero! His cries for help weren’t unheard, thank GOD!
Wow heroes!
See I have a fear of alligators...guess I can't be a cop 😢 wonderful child. I hope everyone is safe.
Them f ing police officers are so slow like if they see a car in the water Then u need to sprint in there instead of walking mad slow…
Dios mio como se fue a parar allí. 😢😢
That boy just breaks my heart. He is so terrified.  Bless his heart.
Thank you❤
That young man is a brave one, saved his mother and knew exactly who to go to
Aww… he was so scared. He did a great job.. he escaped the car then ran to get help!!! ❤️  The cop on the other hand prolly could have showed a little more urgency. When he seen the car he acted like he didn’t wanna get in the water at first… wasting time by asking “is she in there”… ummm, yeah she’s in there… he literally just told you his mom had a seizure while driving and veered off the road… YES she’s in there 🥴🤦🏼‍♀️
That cop has no urgency, had to get the same answer 10 times about a person drowning because he probably didn't want to get wet. The entire time he's casual until the car is basically underwater and then he starts speeding things up a bit; doesn't look like he even got her out either despite all the tools he should've had; it was the other guy that pulled her out. Dude was barely more than a cameraman tbh
Meanwhile the cop taking his time and kept asking is there anybody in the car NOO THE KID ONLY SAID THAT LIKE 6 TIMES I cant
OMG 😮
When a bunch of heroes come together anything is possible!
God's blessing, sir ❤🙏🏽❤
Praise. God, she's ok 🙏
God bless everyone involved
give this man a raise wtfffff
"Is someody in there?" No the kid just drove himself. Smh
Weldon son. Stay calm coz God has taken control by sending an Angel at the right time. Thank you Jesus.
The cop wasting time asking if there is somebody in there as if a person under water can speak.
A sons love to his mom,  whoa if you aren't a biy mom youd NEVER understand ❤❤❤
You did good kid, your Momma needed you and you didnt let her down. Good job dude.
This is my town! Orange texas
Cop moved slow af. It's like he couldn't be bothered .. He's not a hero but glad he was there i suppose
😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😢😢😢
God bless all involved in these heroics 🙏🙏🙏
Glory to God to good people
Lord have mercy i prayed she's ok and god blessed the two men for saving this boy and his mom❤.
just yesterday i experienced a wreck thats changed my view on life. as my family rounded a curve we came across a rolled truck that was in flames. we were the first ones on scene so we threw the car in park and barreled down the hill to find a semi-conscious man pinched between his door and roof with no way to get out. we had no more than half a minute before the flames became too much and had to fall back. as i stumbled back i came across a crowbar that fell out the mans truck and tried to pry his door but had no luck. may mr joseph rest in peace. you will lay heavy in my heart as well though i did not know you, you will forever stick with me.
Such a brave youngman, the desperation to save his momma was on another level. Hope all is well with mom. I too suffer from epilepsy & have Siezures periodically. I do my best to not drive when i dont have meaning i prefer to walk rather than chance causing danger on the road way but there are times i have to drive because some things i need in life are to far for walking or alot of times it's way to hot in Arizona to be walking around so i completely understand this mommas situation.
anybody know if his mom was saved
That poor baby... 😢
He took so long to react tho
How can someone prone to seizures be allowed to drive
Did she live?
😢❤❤
I hope the mom is okay
Praise God he got out to save his mom
She had a seizure and drove into the water, that boys day was traumatic to the core. Hope he heals.
Moving too slow.
I have seizures and I know by babies would do it for me but it hurts so bad to know they could go thru that and be so scared... breaks my heart for that boy
Wow so many questions ,, instead of checking right away.
Crazy thing is the cop was probably a little concerned it might be a trap. You have to be these days. Nice save and smart kid for immediately getting help
Thank God for these heroic men for saving this poor woman. The young man’s desperate cries for help for his mom broke my hart
Good to see cops saving life's instead of ruining them 😊
No urgency from the cop.
It’s heartbreaking to watch the boy go through this 💔 Thank GOD it turnout good at the end!🙏❤️
The officer could have worked faster! Glad mom is good and little boy loves his mom ❤❤❤
Good Samaritan? That’s literally the woman’s child. Brave son rescues mother is what this should say
Your mom can’t drive young bull
Protect and serve and be proud !!!🎉
Move your ass man your a cop. Dude moves likw humpty dumpty
Is it just me or was the officer moving ina very non urgent way in the first half ..
Amazing officer
Tbh that cop was acting way too slow and should be held accountable
Omg.....soooo sad....thank god for the chil and help that stopped...
Could he have reacted any slower at first. Geeze.
Heroes were you least expect them. Her’s was her son. Amen 🙏
Man, I don't know what happens but I don't want to watch. It's tough seeing that little boy like that
Amén 🙏🏾
This happened in my hometown. She was saved and brought to the hospital and is recovering....Thank God her son was with her and the Good lord was watching over the two angels that pulled her from the car.
Damm as an epileptic who has crashed and totaled a car during a siezure this is scary af. Stay safe y'all.
Give the police officer some credit too because he's the one that truly saved her life
The Way My Heart just dropped.... That Cry for help really just made me almost break down..and I don't cry. Blessing onto  that family and the officer
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲hay mi Dios
🙏🙏🙏🙏
❤❤❤❤
❤🙏🏻❤  God bless this boy and his mother and the first responders.  ❤🙏🏻❤
Poor young man and mom.
Did they save her? Bless that boy ❤
Cop took his sweet ass time.
My grandad drove a wrecker first 26 years of my life. I always rode a long with him on a lot of calls since I been old enough to sit in a seat. Even a booster. There was some calls like police calls he wouldn’t let me go on. He would say baby; grandaddy will take u on break down calls bc I’m just towing to a shop or someone’s house he said with a police call I never know what’s going on til I get there and u don’t wanna see some of the things grandaddy has seen. He retired after 50 years My dad opened a nice wrecker shop. Roll backs diesels rotators lots and lots all over and in more than all over the Wiregrass in multiple states. I’ve seen some of the things on his yard. I take a lot of medicine I have a lot of autoimmune and joint problems have Gillian barre syndrome. But I refuse to drive the one mile to the shop and it’s one country road. My nerves go everywhere
Aww what a son!!! Xxxx and he still got his mumma!💋💋💋💋💋hero police for listening to him!!! Xxxx
“Is somebody in there?” I’m stunned
Who the cop be any slower
Why would  the cop yell  if anybodies in There?  seriously...they...can't hear you and it's wasting time with savings her
Thanks to God her son was able to look for help. She must be proud of him. Thanks to the Good Samaritan, the boy, and the cop. The boy inspiration! God blessed!
Thanks to the messenger her son, and thanks to the vessel of God the officer. 🙏🏾🫶🏾❤
She in medical distress & u chilling yelling about is someone in there instead of racing 2 the car to get what he said his mom having a seizure and in a car flipped over under water..... oh righty
That sad
he's to slow needs to act faster then that
This poor baby i hope he copes with this trauma. God bless him ❤
Love is what will save us all.
Poor kid, I hope his mother is ok.
Dafuq do you mean "good samaritan" cop? That's his job...
😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪
“Is she in there”, is somebody in there”, what kind of idiotic questions are those? The boy said she was in the car having a seizure & the cop wasted too much time before helping. 😡
“Is somebody in there”” are you serious!?? No urgency at all! If she’s having a seizure she obviously can’t respond
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I hope she's okay but if a person who have seizures should not be driving it could have been so much worse.
THE TITLE STATED RESCUED.  SO HE SAVED HER...THANK GOD
It breaks me when j see small children afraid for thier parents life😢😢😢
everyone that talks against the law officers forget about this and hope no one sees it. remember things like this because next time it might be you they're helping
Dam the officer was slow af
precious
😭
Is someone in there? Like dayum he already tokd you.. and why is the cop so chilled like dayummm hurry up and save em
Give this officer public ❤u award. So much
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is why it is important not to make your children afraid of police. I have had friends who would tell their kids, there’s a cop, you better be good or he will take you to jail and it would infuriate me. If that child ever has an emergency, they need to run to police, not from them.
Belajar bawa kereta ditemani ibunya namun tersilap tekan minyak terus ke sungai....hati² klu nk mengajar anak memandu..malang tak berbau seperti buah durian...😊😊😊
What a hero love you child ❤❤❤
I want to reach through this phone and just hug that baby! Thank you, officer and good samaritan for saving that mom. The biggest thank you goes to her son, what an incredible young man….he is a hero❤
Did she die ????
Is somebody in there? Duh the kid said the woman was in there, obviously. 🙄 He hesitated/panicked.
Why do people with seizure issues drive cars?  that should not be!
So… I have a question. Does she have a known seizure history? If so, she probably isn’t supposed to have her license. Depending on the situation. Because of reasons like this.  I’m glad everyone is ok.
All these cheers when the cop seemed slow to respond to A CAR IN WATER. The child was likely not joy-riding it -- his panic is real, and is his information is sound. A person with a seizure won't be responding, anyway, so questions are pointless. Worst case, you get wet going over to the car and it's empty, best case, you save a life. I hope he had that punch on him and didn't have to go back because he thought the kiddo was lying.
Let me just walk cause your a POC
Asking if "somebody's in there" while they're inside a car drowning is crazy 😂
Why is police taking his sweet time?
I wish “Good Samaritan, cop” was something that could just be implied, rather than a necessary part of the title
Un heros ❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤
Dude the cop should have just jumped in, bro was asking 21 questions
Thank god for police or anyone that does herring help to all BlackWhite Green or Purple we all bleed 🩸 Red
That cop was way too fxckn calm😢
WOW!!!?? THIS IS GLOBAL NEWS WORTHY!!!!!! I HOPE THE OFFICERS THAT HELPED WERE  PUBLICLY THANKED FOR THEIR HEROISM!!!!
Thank you for saving his mom
My heart just broke when I saw that little helpless little boy. God bless his heart
😢😢😢😢 god bless you son
That officer is taking his sweet ass time
GOD used you today to tell my story about the baby momma in my son's life. Thank you Ms. Faye. ❤
❤espero que fique tudo bem e ela tenha se salvado
That poor baby, God Bless him❤
Bendiciones que valiente ése niño ,Gracias a dios 🙏 🙌 que habían personas para socorrerlos ❤
😢😢😢
again, defund who?!
Man anyone else realise that those cops are to slow to react to situations like this. I would have jumped in as soon as I knew that somebody could have been inside that vehicle.
What the hell do you mean good Samaritan cop he's a cop it's his job to save her life
He didn’t rescue her the other civilian who stepped in did .. listen to him “here , here”
It really doesn’t matter who saved her thank God her and her son is alive❤❤
Again i just want to say thanks to the man that stayed calm and got the job done it was team work and he knew the assignment. ❤🙏🏽👍🏼I'm so glad the young boy seen that man on the road because he was definitely a angel. 💯
This actually happened to me in MS in rankin county. A woman drove off into a ditch and her daughter drowned in the back for about 15 minutes. Ironically I was on college break for two weeks and just had exams and CPR and first aid exam was literally 7 days before I’d never even done true cpr on a human before and this was a very small child. I did cpr for a very long time. Nothing worked it seemed then a woman helped me to do cpr and took over I started to pray and then I took over cpr again and the little girl started to come back almost instantly coughing and making some noise but she wasn’t all the way there. a rankin county sheriff helped me also and there’s dash cam footage of it up if you google it. She was 4 years old and lived. Probably 14 years old today.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Asking if someone is in there AFTER this child is telling you it is … is BEYOND ME
Police are NOT semaritans. Good or bad. They are there to profect and serve. He did his fucking job. Why is this so hard for people? This is why the police are shit. They get such high praise for doing what they're paid to do. 🤦🏼‍♂️
For all the ones screaming F the police.. this is whybwe need cops. They are everyday heros
I don't even know what to say about this one
❤Thank you to the man that help the young boy get his momma out safe. 💯🙏🏽👍🏼
Look at description 🙄 thats not 'good Samaritan' thats dereliction of duty
Beautiful. Save lives, not take them!
Thank the Lord this young man found help for his mom, I pray she makes a full recovery 🙏🏾
I’m glad the cop was there…but why ask…is she in there…go run! Help!
I'm crying like a baby right now
😭😭😭😭
The cop was asking if anyone’s in there like he was scared. Like bro you just heard the kid say his mom was in the car yo ass should be running without hesitation to brake her out.
Cops just standing there “is someone in there?” Bro did the screaming kid not just tell you his mom was trapped ??
Yo rescate a dos mujeres que se calleron en un río boca abajo el carro era color rojo y  las saque cargadas y un amigo me  alludaba a quitarme las autoridades que solo no sabían aser su trabajo y otros trasculcBan aber que avi dentro de beiculo
Can this cop move any slower… good lord dude.
the cop only showed a sense of urgency when he saw the good samaritan was already in there . terrible cop
Thank God for the Good Samaritans who responded to this boys cry for help God bless you! ❤
So scary
Poor baby.😢
People are saying that this police officer did not want to help this child. I don't understand. He clearly did. Just keep the funding them. Hello Venezuela
God, please help the children of our world. They need you so dearly.😪🙏 amen to this hero and the police officer
And people hate police smh ,all police are not bad❤
God Bless them. Boy Loves his mom makes you cry.😢😮
wow !
“Is anybody in there?”       she’s under water having a seizure bro get your police ass in there tf you waitin for???
Is this not the laziest slowest reacting cop on the planet ? It’s like why must you ask if someone’s in there or not ? Afraid to get your dooky wet huh shame I hope she’s ok since every second counts in times like these
Holy CRAP!
Baby boy told you she is having a seizure and is sunk in the water.  Your first instinct is to get there and pause before helping to ask the seizing woman that’s under water “is somebody in there?”  I’m just wondering why   Other than that excellent job helping this family
The cop was a little slow moving, but probably an older gentleman.  Just glad they got moma out ❤
such a brave boy..
Pero como ayudar si estás con el celular en la mano
See how people is dead the little telling he the woman in the car and he keeping asking if is someone in the car he no he able
Our officers are heroes! They just deal with dangerous people and situations and our Criminal System don’t give them what they deserve respect and authority
😢😢😢😢😢
Where is his sense of urgency?? Thank the officer for his courageous deed tho!! More important much thanks to the samaritan already on scene; I believe it's due to this guy's courageous response that this woman is alive today🤔🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️🇺🇲✌🏾
The little is his mom angel he got help and saved his mom
That cop is terrible.  I wouldn't even shake his hand.  He takes his sweet time like he's going grocery shopping as that boy is watching his mother drown.  The good sarmaratin did all the work.
I thought that 3rd person was her daughter. Whoever saved her life, thank you for being there at the right time.🙏🙏🙏bless you all.
Very sad. Poor little guy . very scary
Estos videos deben de aserse virales felicidades
That poor boy 😔 he held himself together well explaining the scenario he was coming from. I would’ve been in tears and shock all at once. I genuinely hope his mom is okay, and himself. 🙏
WOW that poor kid is going to be traumatized he's going to need some counseling bless his heart thank the Lord he's his mama's angel
Cop: is somebody in there?
"My mums in the car" "Is anyone in the car?"...  What did I just say?
The title of this video doesn't make sense.  How can a cop be a good Samaritan when it's literally part of their job to do these types of things? Sorry to be negative but you would assume there would urgency when there is a woman literally trapped under water drowning for who knows how long because of the edits of the video.
HE saved his mom’s life for sure!!!! it was all him and the kind stranger
« There is somebody in here ? »  The person into the water locked in car : « 💦🐡☠️ »  Cops « sorry kid i don’t like lies like that let me get some coffee »
“Is anyone in there?” The front of the car is submerged and the kid said his moms in there and was seizing….why are we wasting time?
Nobody praising the cops for saving this woman's life.
Hero’s a born every day!
Thank you for the truly dedicated and caring officers of the law! There are good ones and some great ones amongst the crappy ones!
it made me so anxious that he kept asking "is someone in there" after the boy told him ALREADY the situation
that kid needed a cigarette and he didn’t even know it
Omg😢😢😢😢
Thank God she was saved 💛💜
“MY MOM IS IN THERE” *Cop walking like he’s about to hit a vending machine*
Angels come in all sizes shapes and shades!!
😮😢I'm so glad he was with Her,n someone came in Time to save her ,Thank GOD💪🏿🙏🏿
GOD BLESS THIS OFFICER AND THIS YOUNG MAN FOR THEIR LIFE SAVING GREAT DEED!!!! 💖💖💖💖
🙏
“Is somebody in there”, really? Obviously if the boy says it he says it, I hate how governmental people and police officers are just so dumb nowadays
Poor boys cry thank God for the fast thinking from the EMS saved her life 🙏
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤los dos son unos héroes ❤❤
This is why when you know you have medical issues you need to limit your self to protect those sround you instead of being stubborn. Kid knew she eas having a seizure which means its not the first time. She shouldnt have been driving to begin with.  Could have drowned her own kid.
As soon as little boys said that to me , I would've been jumping in that water
This video proves I could never work that professionally in an emergency! Had that young man come running up to me, I would’ve ran & gone headfirst into the water while processing: “Mom+Driving +Seizure=Car, half submerged, kids  wet.” Forget reiterating the facts, prep, to her son very s l o w l y, and trying to calm him too…. ❤👨‍✈️🫡❤
Look at God!! Did that Police Officer just happen to be passing by?
This is what YouTube used to be
Only a fucking idiot "adult" could drowned in a pond that they can stand in...
God bless you all.❤😊
'Is somebody in there?' What a silly question.
This happened on my birthday
God bless the kid and his mom ✨✨✨🙏🙏🙏🙏
Is someone in there? Yea asshole my mom
That kid is a bad ass.
Poor boy so desperate
More racist cops and white men! Saving that black womans life, HOW DARE THEY! People need to see this racism! Why isn’t this all over the media?!? 😡
God bless and keep them.  😮
My heart breaks  listening to this little boy. 😢
Total desperation, the patrol passed by, GOOD POLICE!!!! My respects 🫡👍🏽
Poor kid hes suffering so much to safe his mom 😢
When you love your momma!! IT'S UNCONDITIONAL. BUT, GOD. AND HIS AWESOME LOVE. 🥹
❤
GOD! IS SO AWESOME!! PRAISE YOU DEAR LORD!!
God bless the officer who helped this boy and saved his mother's life. You're awesome!
Porque no muestran completo el rescate, así uno aprende como puede ayudar
Thank God for this blessed child and the good person who saved the child's mums life  🙏
Dear Lord Jesus, protect this family, please . And all responders.  In Jesus' mighty name, Amen
Why the cop take his sweet time.. askin, is anybody in there?  Dude the kid just came and got you because he mom is in the car in the water. Smh. The good samaritan saved her... Take his badge, he aint cut out for that life.
😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏
What’s wrong is the officer is asking dum question at the moment when they need help wet another job
❤❤❤
Et le cameraman  film regarde que fait t'il
A cop rescuing a trapped driver from a submerged vehicle is not being a good samaritan. They are doing their job. It is illegal for first responders to not stop and render aid under these circumstances.
So why does videos like this not go viral like the ones that try to make our police look bad? Most law enforcement are amazing brave people who protect and serve. There are a few bad ones and they just need to be weeded out. I pray that people stop thinking all police are bad, because they are needed. Without them we would have lawlessness.
What would you people do without police
Who made the car salad? Seizure made the car salad🐸🐢
He asking if somebody in there and he just told u….
Props to the officer with the body cam.  He was calm and calculating in a time of distress.  That is EXACTLY what you are supposed to do and that saves lives.  It might not seem that there was a sense of urgency, but the calmness helps make intelligent decisions, and helps you not screwing up.
I hope the mom and son are ok now.
boo.  thumbs down for not pinning update, full vid, details, etc.  bullshit.
Thank you sir🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Well done officer ....thank you❤
The child was clearly telling the truth. The officer delayed precious moments.
God BLESS HER N HER BABIES, AMEN
They want help when it’s convenient for them. But shit all over police the rest of the time.
What caused the accident. It's a wonder her kids weren't injured. This is awful
The cop had no sense of urgency whatsoever
Look how he is soak an wet he did everything to save his mom Mothers all over  these babys no us first these are Gods gifts  to us this shows no matter how young they will do what ever to love and protect us so we must do everything in our power to protect them an keep them safe.❤
Thank God for people with a heart like yours.❤
😮 Lord 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Jesus sent her an Angel. He didn’t waist time. He said “tell them to hurry up” he could see she needed CPR right away and additional medical assistance.
Poor kid
Thankfully this is one of those instances where everything worked out and good people were in the right place at the right time when help was desperately needed. I'm so glad to find out that everyone is okay. Such a brave young man. ❤
Você  está de parabéns  Deus abençoe  todos  vcs .🙏🙌🕊👏👏👏
Kudos to this officer
😢
Damn
How dumb is this damn cop.  Kid "my moms having a seizure the car has sunk"  Cop walks to car in lake "is anybody in there"  Nah dumbass the kid jus crying wolf
“Is the car unlocked?” HOW BOUT GO FIND OUT
Oh my God my heart was aching for this little guy! Thank you for your fast response and saving this poor lady ! HpGod Bless🙏❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hope mom makes a full recovery.  Those poor kids too... What a terrible scare.
Could we move any slower. 😢
Respect,  Mr officer. Jah guide ❤
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This mother literally took her child to a street takeover!?
Omg, these poor kids. Glad mom is going to be OK. 😢
“Is someone in there?” No fucking snit Sherlock
Cop did not seem to have much care or urgency…….
Bro taking his time...wtf
Who was shooting the video?
Why the fuck did the cop wait so long. The kid clearly told you his mom was in there having a seizure.
Lord thank you for giving this little one back his mother and lord bless the men's that help same her life ❤❤❤❤
It may be a "good Samaritan" act but he's a cop just doing what he's suppose to do!
This cop is stupid lol
Jesus loves you ❤
But God ❤❤❤
That poor family.  God protect mother and son and bless those men that helped them.
GREAT JOB! ❤❤❤
for anyone who is wondering he was asking is anyone in there because there was another child in the water trying to save her mom. it wasn’t just a little boy that she had a daughter as well. I think the cop was asking to see if he needed to save additional people or if someone was just in the water trying to help, the son never mentioned his sister seeemingly, they had already gotten out, he mentioned his mama.
Poor kid will remember this day for life
He told you she was in there  12 x.
Not sure why officers don't carry tow gear, a strap would have stopped it from sinking and depending on officers vehicle might actually pull it out, they used to back home in GA in the crown vics and cherokees,  anyway glad they were saved, human life of all kinds is precious ❤
My God
I pray for this family  also the good people  that came together  to get his mum out  My daughter  is a very bad epilepsy and don't drive and will never  be able to drive  On many occasions  when she has had seizers  the people that jumped in to help were the real hero's  As 2 many times she has landed in ICU due to having  episodes on the train bus cars school UCC these  earth angels  have gone beyond  help xx
im so glad shes ok
Slowest officer ever man
His cry choked me up abit
Insurance adjusters going crazy
They stopped without telling us if she was ok?
God bless this little guy and his mom
Good friend of mine had a seizure whilst driving, he’s a star in someone else’s sky now.  Bless this family and officer
Nice but one thing he already told the cop that she is in the water... Why does the cop have to ask one more time...
Poor baby I am glad there was someone that did not hesitate to help I hope and pray she is ok. May God watch upon her and her family always. Amen.
Great cops, great kid. Hope the mom makes a full recovery. So many times we see evil cops. Thank God for the good ones
“Is somebody on there” “HELP HER”  Fire this cop please.
Ya just take your time oficer
Howd she get a license if shes epileptic?
Mais c’est quoi ce délire avec ces questions idiotes du flic en voyant la voiture à moitié sous l’eau !Et cette lenteur !  Bravo au fils de cette femme qui est le vrai héros 🎉 le flic n’a fait que son devoir avec l’aide d’autres personnes mais il a fait ça par dépit apparemment 😑
There's good people everywhere it's the few that make people hate
Well it’s lucky the driver was black.  The rescuer didn’t have to deal with unbuckling her seatbelt which probably save him precious seconds.
😢
The kid started prying before the cop….
Too many fucking questions. Help for Christs sake.
Heroes all over the place here. Good Lord.
Hugs to the kid. Hopefully his mom is ok. Time for a little googling, I know where orange Texas is.
Why...is there...a recording going on in this session/circumstance... Just help that's all that's needed and required
The kid tells the cop that someone’s in there and the cop is so busy yelling “is anybody in there” while not moving😂
Praying for y’all 😢
Dude's yelling is someone in there lol. Just hop in and help her
is there some one in thereaaaaaaa durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I’m sorry but that officer could have had more urgency in the way he moved toward the water. Also asking if the woman is still in there when the little boy clearly told him. Also not grabbing in a punch in the first place.
God protect this woman and her children, as a person who suffers from epilepsy, this is not something to mess around with.
Oh I thank god for sparing her life and a very special thank you to all those who assisting in her rescue & recovery. God bless you all!
Yo this cop deserves to be punished. A kid crying and breaking down about his mom having a seizure in a car who is drowning deserves to have immediate action. The fact the cop said,”is anyone in there?” Is insane.
Am I the only one who thinks the cop was way too laid back and slow to act? The good Samaritan was giving his all
I hope that young dude recovers well from his trauma and that his momma is alive and well.
This needs a trillion views those kids saved their mother 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
The guy was just taking his time. Is anybody in there? The kid just said she’s having a seizure and went in the water. 🫠
Most of them do.   Dont let you tube tell you differently.
The cop wasn’t even tryna help how rude
Mate he just told you she was in there!  You seemed very apprehensive to even get in the water!
That officer not fast enough and he must stop asking questions and do the right thing.
I wonder if she was epileptic. He said that she is having a seizure.
The child is a hero and so is the officer . God bless you both
Very brave child  saved his mothers life
God bless you buddy and you mother for a full recovery
Thankfully he was able to help but slow moving people are frustrating.
🙌👏👏👏🙏🙏🫶🫶🫶
BACK OUR BLUE 💯
You to those cops and thank you to her son for getting help for her I'm so happy everyone is okay
Why is she driving as she has seizures?
The fuck you asking for the boy just told you
Epilepsy, the worst and so so common. Never know when your body is going to shutdown and if it is going to reboot. So much tecnology and still fighting against such common diseases.
Not Good Samaritan. Although good. That’s literally his job. He just did it how’s he’s supposed to
His cries for help just broke my heart. I really hope his mom made it.
3 brave souls!   The little boy The Samaritan  The officer  Respect!!
Imagine that being in Flordia, gators everywhere
Jesus Christ cop was asking all these freaking questions get in there and save her
Thank you Jesus bless you young man
was the cop a special student in school or what..?
Se fosse uma família branca eles teriam pulado feito SEAls
It's good to see true heroes at the right place at the right time. 🙌🏻
Omg that was heart breaking 🥺  what a brave little Man she has 💙
To me, it didn't seem like the officer was really in a rush to help young boy when others came. That's when it seemed like some urgency was there.
God HELP Texas...so much tragedy in Tx. 😢
Great job many blessings to you and your family
Was thry ok
🙏🥺😢🙏🙏
Thank God they all saved her. This broke my heart to even see this 😢.
That kid’s desperation would have had me rushing the water to that car without asking questions & slowly wading in. I know! That would have been a total disregard to my own safety but all I would have been thinking of is having to tell that child his mom drowned in front of him. Congrats to the officer and good samaritans who gave that woman a second chance to be with her child or children. 🎉
Slowest moving cop ever
. He took this way to like i dont want to be bothered.  Oh ok one min.  In comes a normal citizen who actually rescues this women cuz he feels for this child and his family.    Yet the cop gets the credit cuz he did cpr. I get it.  Yet what makes me mad is the hesitation he had and the lackadaisical attitude just makes me mad
Terrifying
Ma'am you cant park there
The bravery of that boy is beyond impressive.
Is somebody in there??? Тхат цоп ис думб.
These are the good ones. This is why people become cops.  To help those in need
He asked is somebody in there, bro r u dumb the kid just said so
Poooor Baby his little face 🥺🙏🏻❤
How did he get out but the doors are locked?
For God's sake the boy already said she's having a seizure... Why was that loudan asking questions again instead of jumping into action please?
Bless him, my heart breaks watching this, a real hero
JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON ✅✅✅❤️❤️
The kid did what almost every kid would do in that position respect to the kid and he will grow up to be a better man. But I wouldn’t bet on anyone else being able to save her life but this police officer.
This cop is a damn idiot the child ran dwn there to tell u come help nd u get there nd ask q dumbass question i swear some people are just plain dumb is someone in there did that child just tell u his mom was in there! Lets not say he is the hero that other person did just as much if not more should have grab the damn punch before u went in the water
I hope and pray she will be alright,her son too.
When I worked personal protective services a bunch of us got deputized during the riots by our sheriff because they were stretched so thin. The training officers and sheriff all told us to always remember to be compassionate and that when you're appearing in someone's life in uniform things are already super shitty.
Boy screaming my mom in there begging for help.  Cop:  "is there anybody in there" from the curb.    Cop: Nope... just a kid crying wolf why bother jump in trying to make sure right.     Clown cop.
The work of Jesus 🙏🙏
That cops Sense of urgency is sad, if it was a lil white boy it’s would of been a different story. Man walked to car, stop by the water and said “ is there someone in there” like the boy didn’t tell him. The boy scream for her life and the cop taking his sweat time 😢
Women are bad drivers
"Is sumbuddy in thERe!!!"  Bruh, this reminds me of the "Are you choking" video😆 🤣 😂 💀
GOD BLESS YOU OFFICER.
Your first question is "is there someone in there"? If I seen a car in the water and a kids desperate pleas I would be diving in that water fast af
Good job cop  👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💖💖💖
Yeah hell nah, this dead in the middle of gator country.
This police or troopers fail his job , he act with haste although it’s a life and death situation his demeanor said it all but if he was firefighters he would of been in the water broke the windows out and already rescued that woman this is why I would more respect a firefighter than any government official  🫳⬇️🎤
Dios Bendiga siempre  a esa persona y a las q hacen siempre algo bueno x el prójimo ❤🙏🙌🙏
Took him ages to get in that water kid says his mom is in the car under water and that cop doing stupid questions .
How did the kid get out of the car ..
Yeah, having a seizures wow may God give her the strength to get back out and do a regular duties as a mother
Description of video say “good Samaritan cop……” idk if that’s right when it’s just his job…… breaking news! Good Samaritan baker bakes bread……
What you wanted to bet the cop still gave her a ticket for reckless driving 😭😂👍🏾
May she recover in the name of Jesus
Thank You❤❤❤.
Take ur fkn time dude...
Why the fuck is he asking if there’s somebody in there. There’s clearly a person in distress. Bro needs to learn to be a little bit more situationally aware. Those few seconds could have cost that woman her life.
Can the cop move any slower
Her son is a hero and that officer is such a good man. God bless this family
Amazing job to the son and the man who helped him. God bless you all
Suelta el  jodio celular que coraje..me da....uuuf.
😢
Brave child. I truly hope she made it
Hero's, both of them!!!  Blessings to the mom for a speedy recovery!!  She might need to give up her license.
This happened in Houston Texas, this child is a Hero so proud of this child getting help for his mom, last heard she survived. And hospitalized!! True HERO a .edal for him! Thumbs 👍👍👍👍👍💯💯💯 Percent
Damn. That’s crazy. Good bless these children and the officers for saving the mother’s life. A seizure, then a wreck, goodness gracious. 🙏🏾
So sad but yes u can hear his voice in the back ground and see the guy wd saved her, and knowing God always on dùty and watchithing thank God they were saved ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
NO. Stop singing praises. Where the HELL is his urgency? There is a difference between being calm and moving slow! The cop was slow! He also wasted time asking the dumbest question!!!! "Is anybody in there?"  WTF WTF WTF!?!?  OBVIOUSLY. From the distressed kid to the guy trying to save her and too focused to respond to the dumb cop. That is a time-sensitive situation. Cops know when to move and he didnt care to be faster. Walking and foolishness. I know you all are seeing that.
Acab tho
Usually they're killing us for a paycheck
Praying for her and her family. May the Lord bless all the men who helped save her life. What a wonderful son, who lived his Momma! ❤️
How tf did she get in there 😅😅😅 happy it all worked out
Thank you police officer and praise the little boy❤
Get the hellcat to
Sounds like she’s had seizures before? He seemed familiar with this happening to her.
That sound when he Resurfaced sounded like a mad toad
Why it took the cop so long to get in the water is beyond me
The fear In this Lil boys eyes crying for his momma made me cry
The police officer took too long
God bless her brave baby and the Awesome policeman 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Don’t move too fast now, geez
Lord bless this family. Strengthen them for this journey. Thank you GOD and bless all who stepped up. Grace and Mercy to you all.
😢😢😢😢😭😭😭
and feminists keep saying we need no man
Is the car unlocked? ….
Pobrecito niño, se me encoje el corazón de verlo así
Oh god that little man is so brave. Bless him and his family.
Stay strong
There are still human beings that care, 👍. That poor boy almost get a heart attack, 🥺😪. Very proud of him, 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Children who save someone's life, including their parents, should get some type of an award. To consider them a hero.
Just standing there, saying is somebody in there with no fucks given is insane… just slowly walk over no rush or anything… wtf
I bet this won't go viral. It would damage the narrative that white people are racist, and that would be bad for Kamala's campaign.
My son is a life guard  it is really scary  for all  ... thanks officers
Brave kid saved the day❤
People with a history of seizures shouldn't get licenses
Why do they never fucking put the end of the video !
Thank you Lord!!!
The cop was not really putting any effort to save the black women, the latino guy he need all the work , in the little boy.
Que coño andáis grabando cuando tendríais que estar concentrados en salvarle la vida?????????
So proud of that young man!¡!¡! And ty to the Officer and Good Samaritan
God bless all these people and I hope everyone heals from this.
"Is she in there?" 🦧Smooth brain but seems like a good heart.
Could this guy move any slower 😢
I dont understand why at first he shouts "Is somebody in there" without rushing for help when the kid already tells him his mom is there btw kudos to the hero❤❤
😢😢😢😢😢
" To protect and to serve." You dont see that anymore on police cars.  Officers still hold to that.
Bless you for finding someone to help your mama.
In a situation like that I don't think the cop needs to be so calm😅
People being People, no color or political garbage to mix in this heartwarming story. This is what America is really like. Mainstream media will only tell you lies abd our gov wants us to hate each other. Not anymore, we Americans stand together against the left and right trying to tear us apart.  God bless us Americans
The little boy helped to 💯
Blessings are wished for this and his mom.
Je suis soulagée la maman de ce petit garçon est sauvée. Merci monsieur 🙏🙏la détresse de ce petit garçon pour sauver sa maman m'a bouleversée 😢😢 J'espère qu'elle va bien maintenant. Incroyable sauvetage ! Pas évident d'ouvrir la portière lorsqu'il y a de l'eau. Merci beaucoup pour l'avoir sortie et sauvée 🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
That little boys voice  . He was so scared. .
When y’all googled JO😂😂
Oh god
This kid just made me cry. Bless him in whatever he chooses to do or be in life. What a hero. 🥹💯🫡
Cop was asking dumb questions is someone in there ? Wtf do you think ?
Praise God!!!!!
Thank GOD THAT LIL ANGEL WAS ABLE TO GET OUT AND HELP SAVE HIS MOM
For one it’s his job stop glorifying this and too he was not acting fast enough
Thank you Lord in Jesus name Amen
The poor kid ...such a trauma for life.
Glad she's OK 👍 q hopefully they never show the End.  Why was she driving with a,seizure
Lol cops just taking his time
Scary
Thank the Lord for good people ❤
I'm going to be real and say if that boy was white the officer would have been moving faster. He calmly saying is somebody in there instead of just running and jumping in to save whoever in there. But thank God she's Alive
I feel bad for that little boy. Apparently seizures is nothing new to that family because he knew exactly what was happening. She shouldn’t have been driving the car
HOP IN, everyday in this life, humanity is displayed the motivation, Love. The officers immediate response to a Childs plea for a mother. NOT a movie but real life.
Bless her heart she was having a seizure. And she was stuck in the car.
Help him
🙏🏿
The cop is moving way to slow and pissing me off
He told you his mom is in there for lord’s sake! You still asking if somebody is in there? 😢
My Congratulations the Heroes… the Boy and his Mom’s Rescuer!!! God Bless Them All!!!
What a stud. Good for you kiddo.
Yeah I have seizures I completely understand
Omg....how terrifying. That baby made sure he got his mom help. I'm so glad that they got her out and saved her life. Thank you my Gracious God! He is such a hero. I pray that he was embraced and showered with so much Love. May they be blessed and healthy beyond measure! Thank you Jesus for putting help in the right place at the right time and for allowing that baby the provision to act swiftly to ensure his mom would be rescued. Look at God!! Hallelujah!! ❤❤❤❤ My God, I could not imagine but I'm glad it turned out in his favor. An hero and an angel! 😇😇❤❤
"good samaritan"........uhm no, that's literally law enforcement's job even for Black people🤷🏿‍♀️🙄
Just when i thought we were going to save tax payer dollars on food stamps too.
A miracle in action. The Good Lord was watching out for this Mom, son & good Samaritan Police Officer.
The cops saved her the boy did what he was supposed to do.. I don’t see anyone else jumping in the water to save a stranger give credit where it’s due people.
If you have seizures it can never be safe to drive any vehicle. I am glad she is recovering.
Holy shit that cop was moving slow af! An average citizen would have had her out by then. I literally think it's because the cop didn't like that the boy was insistent! I absolutely believe that. That man's heart rate didn't even get to going as fast as it would if he accidentally walked into the woman's family reunion
🙏🏿🙏🏿
🙏🙏🙏🙏
DIOS LE SALVO !! EL DA LA VIDA Y LA QUITA !!!! LOS DEMAS AYUDARON AL MILAGRO PERO LA GLORIA ES DE DIOS !!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
His was on my dads bday
What a brave child!!! He saved his mom!!
This cop sucks ass. Wtf the lil kid is doing more than he did.
What a great kid❤
That poor boy… 😢 hope she’s okay
Sempre con una mano occupata dal telefono, anche quando fanno un salvataggio, perché il video è più importante di avere 2 mani libere, che siano animali, persone, prima viene il video.
Man he sure wasn’t in a hurry Wow I’m glad It’s wasn’t white boy or a white lady. I could have ordered McDonald’s,unbelievable.
Tell me she is alive please
🙏🏾🕊🙏🏾
Pass bloß auf das dein Handy nicht nass wird. Sonst geht womöglich die Aufnahme am arsch. Blödmann.😮
Defund them, say the communists....
Why is he slow 😭
Two  ❤  with legs 🦵🏻🦵🏻  🤓MJ
Wao que dios los bendiga
OMG how horrifying for the little boy.
Oh Jesus, please continue to send your angels to this family! To be under water and fight for her life for so long and now be on her way to recovery is nothing short of a miracle!
I’m happy that the officer did help the kids and mom. But I am a bit confused about him asking if somebody is in the car or calling out for the person in the car to answer when he already told the officer that his mom was having a seizure and sunk and was in the car and he can clearly see that the front  of the car is submerged and that there’s a girl in the front trying to get her out. I’m just…like, I don’t really understand his lack or urgency? Did he just not want to get wet or scared for his own safety? Why did it take so long for him to put the pieces together?
Make sure you have a small center punch on a Keychain and in car.  Sending prayers and love. Thanks heroes.
Thank you Jesus they saved her life❤❤❤❤❤ The little boy is a hero I saw this absolutely incredible Lord Jesus always protect this little boy and his mother all the rest of their life
Please understand that not all cops are bad. This child and the officer portrayed love, bravery, and compassion. God bless the both of them for saving her life.
💯🙏🏽♥️
That kid is a rock star
That baby was in distress...
Amazing man , and smart child , poor sweetheart that was awful to go threw ❤
"Is she in there"
Oh my God...thank God they could save her. That poor child is so scared
Good Samaritan rescues woman the cop did fuck all
Could that cop move any slower?
😇**WOW...this coulda went LEFT..**🌹Good looking  out, young man👑 Thank You,  Officer for your Gallant response👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
God bless 🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼❤️
Both 3 guys saved the woman ❤
Guy just strolls on into the water after making sure there was someone trapped 6 times... Like the kid panicking wasnt enough???  Jump in like YOUR life depends on it .. thats what youre paid to do!!!
That cop sure wasn't in too much of a hurry to get in there and start helping
Little boy got help to save his mom's life... bless his heart for acting so quickly, he is a hero & so is the cop that went down & got her. Anyone want to acknowledge that? Strange how people's reactions are these days. I hope you never need that type of help!
Props to the kid for giving all the essential information in that horrific experience. At his age, it would be way to easy to panic and just scream help with no context. That took a lot of courage to explain exactly what is happening.
The cops asking if somebody in there 🤔
Great work. Respect...!!!!
Taking forever
Gratidão  às pessoas que oa salvaram....Este garoto partiu meu coração  vê-lo tão desesperado para salvar sua familia❤❤❤❤.Deus abençõe  todos os envolvidos.
All glory be to our creator 🙌🏾 for allow people to be at the right place, at the right time, with the right heart for humanity. 💙💙💙💙 blessings to all 🙏🏽
What is taking him so long to get in that water??🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
❤ this family .  I hope their mother is ok !  This child became a Man that day !
Sending healing prayers
I am so happy everyone is okay! But I feel like the cop could’ve provided more verbal reassurance to the distressed soaking wet child and skipped asking questions like “is somebody in there?” In an obviously crashed sunken car or “is the door unlocked?”   I understand needing information but that boy was in such shock once the cop was alerted to the situation I feel like he has the responsibility to put facts and clues together and take leadership. Still VERY glad he was there to help.
Salute to the Good Samaritan. In 2014 a girl leaving Lauberge Casino in Lake Charles, La flipped her car off the end 210 bridge and I stopped with 1 other guy. She was completely unconscious and her car was already on fire. While we were trying to get her out a couple others ran up to help. We got her through her window (dress was on fire, legs burned) and carried her about 20 feet before the car completely went into flames. Once EMS got there and she was loaded into the ambulance I left. The other guys waited for news people to come and did their 15 minutes of fame on TV. They acted they were first there and did everything. The only person that mentioned me was the officer that was first on scene which I’m thankful for. My mind was never on getting on the news in that situation. She lived and ended up writing me on FB about 6-7 months afterward.
Oh that poor baby is so scared and traumatized! I hope mom is ok!!
Herzklekota fes
The man on the passenger side saved her weather he was a cop or not idk
He said she is having a  Seizure .  Hopefully she is ok. Read comments
I’d be scarred for life
God bless you young man. You are a blessing to your family.
Fuck seizures..I have them and I refuse to drive. I’m so glad they’re both okay. Poor baby was terrified.😢
Gracias por salvar a esta persona, un niño muy valiente, de salvar a su Mamá.❤ ayúdalos Oh Dios.
Good kiddos ❤❤
I want to know what took him so long to get in the water
There should have been more sense of urgency. I understand remaining calm, but every second counts
Oh this broke me down. Lord please 😢😢
Know that your mom is alive also due to your bravery of getting the alarm out! The gift of life for the gift of life.
this cop took for ever !! good thing the other guy was there to help
Why was he asking if someone was in there initially and not running to see?  He needed more sense of urgency to check in the beginning.  Was he asking someone else who was standing there?
DIOS Bendiga Toda su Vida A El  Ángel Terrenal que Le Salvo  VIDA A La Mama De Este Niño ❤
Hope his mama is ok.
Thank you Lord Jesus 🙏
Why was she driving? 25 years ago, 2 of my dad's friends were deleted by a priest with epilepsy.  Glad the kid is ok. Mom needs to catch charges for child endangerment. No, I don't have sympathy for a person who disregards the life of a child.
Dios bendiga a ese niño a su mamá y a la hermana, nacieron de nuevo y al héroe que sacó a la madre wow! ❤
Is the car unlocked are you insane
What a great loving kid that would not give up on his mama. God Bless them both…
😢😢😢🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
😮😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤🙏❤
Is the car unlocked? It’s submerged. Doesn’t really matter.
These are REAL POLICE! You brave men & women who keep us safe in times of peril. I SALUTE & COMMEND EACH &( EVERYONE ONE OF YOU. It takes a brave and  courageous heart & soul to put your life on the line for a total stranger. By pulling his mom out each of you have impressed your this child crying for help "if in trouble go to the police". They want to help you. You can trust them. May you each be blessed.
Omg
OMG❤❤😢😢😢
😢😭😭🙏🙏🙏♥️🙏🙏🙏😢
Prayers to the families god is good
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
next he will give her a ticket and try to take her child away
GOD 😇'S The AlMIGHTY Places His Angels In Places For Reasons In Seasons ☝🏾🙏🏾🙌🏾💪🏾☝🏾🙏🏾🙌🏾💪🏾☝🏾🙌🏾💪🏾☝🏾
Female drivers no survivors
That police did not plan on getting wet that day
Dude moving that slow as the car in the water like wtf
Thank y
Sometimes if you pay very close attention and don’t dismiss it GOD will reveal himself in all his glory!
Cop taking to long.
😢❤
Kid clearly tells the cop she’s having a seizure and where she is..   cop: “anyone in there”
Really though! There was no hustle, he went in and back out of the water to go grab a punch when he should have busted the window with his gun, flash light, anything in his utility belt even his fist. There was no hustle and it made her damage suffered worse. I haven't watched the whole video but at least he was there. Stupid, but there
😢 THANKS 🙏  ❤ BLESS YOUR FAMILY ❤
Is someone in there? How does he expect to get an answer?
Why ain’t this on the news
And people want to defund the police 🙄
Like wtf is he asking repeatedly is anybody in there when the hysterical child has ran you down and informed you his mom was in need of help, tf 🤨😩🙄
Rip to all who lost their lives. Tragic
I feel like the cop didn’t have a sense of urgency.
I admire the calm voice of the policeman. Just watching and Im kinda screaming in ly lungs dont talk just veered into action. But its okay. That must be the correct way for a trained rescuer but not for a panicking civilians😢
This little man saved his mother life so glad that she was okay may God continue to bless the family 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
As soon as I heard the kid speak I knew it was bad.  He just saved her life.  Bravo to you… 👏
That cop was in zero hurry, surprised she made it
Why’s the cop Reacting so slow
Where Is more video ?
“Is somebody in deerrr”?
Because kids is black they took there time dude walking slower then a migit
Thank you guys for helping her and for her brave son who alerted the police. Good job young man.
🙏😢😢😢😢
Thanks to the Good Samaritan. BUT he seemed to lack urgency and compassion.
Damn man needs to move faster and not waste time asking if someone is in there. The kid told him. Every second counts in such a situation.
Duds wen u see a car like that's u don't ask if someone is in there u just check if there are any survivors 😅
Poor boy😢 facing his worst fears.I hope they are both fine.
Someone award this child ❤
Why did the cop act soooo relaxed? Hurry man someone is under water 😭
Almighty Gif willed her to live  he sent just the right man to help.✝️
Where’s his dad at?
Left turn Clyde
That cop has no sense of urgency 🤦
You can't be a good Samaritan AND a cop.
Soooo slower worker.....i think lazy police
He did not wanna help he was soo chill about it saying is someone in there how tf they gonna talk if they in the water
Look I'm not trying to criticize but dang the cop who had the blip couldn't move any slower...
🙏🙏🙏
Why tf they asking if somebody in there after the kid told them 💀
Is some body in there I don’t know idiot jump in the water and see.. save a life today put some work in
Cop ain't work shit. A stranger did what you didn't have the back bone to do
Why does she have a license if she has seizures that’s dangerous
Bravo à tous ❤❤❤❤
Beautiful brave boy. Thank God he found someone willing to help.
😢 Astahafirou 💔🙆🏽😭☝🏽 Allah Lianlial andhima woiatoubou ilayihi 😭 Yaroibi 🛐🤲🏽🙏🏽☝🏽
God bless this family after this traumatic experience. Amen.
Oh that poor little lad, hope his mum was OK...
Good thing there was a police officer close by. And that she got saved.She has a brave son! People that have siezures I dont think are allowed to drive. I could be wrong.
I see the comments saying she's expected to make a full recovery and all I can add is a HalleluYah!
Thats a horrible cop so slow to act the other guy cared more!
Bendito Dios 😮
The cop needs training with stupid question is that a car, hum, is it in the water, humhum, is she in there, hum, have you tried getting her out humhum, what is her name, humhum
Oh that poor baby. I sincerely hope he’s able to recover from such a traumatic experience. What an amazing little hero, his mama raised! Hopefully they’re both able to have a speedy recovery💕
Poor baby boy! That must be so scary! I hope his mom is okay and was able to be rescued in time! ❤
Why The fuck she driving with kids when she knows that she has seizures?
Had this baby mess up 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 OMG THANK U Because I could only imagine if he would have lost her he would have  Probably blames his self
It broke my heart to see this child in such distress.
God bless you good people amen
God heard his cry. Praise to the police
Is there someone in the car????  Didn’t he just tell you his Mother had a seizure and is in there!  Take your time But Hurry Up! Smh!
How did the boy get out though?
Cop screaming is somebody in there   Lil Boy: like negro I already told you 😂😂😂
That boy is a hero!. Those cries were heartbreaking
Poor kid
Americans are so slow 😂 “is there somebody in there” nah he’s just crying saying his moms name for the fun of it
What a stewpit cop, boy told him 10 times she is in the car drowning, cop standing next to the water with his donut cholesterol brain watching the car"iS tHeRe SoMeBuDy iN tHeRe" 🤪 tuuuuuuurddddd tuuuuuurrrrdddddd omfg
God is good 🙏
Awesome job you guys!!!!
🙏 🙏
😢❤😢 Senhor  abençoe  essa criança  e esse homem que ajudou  e sua mãezinha ❤
This man needs to get a pair and find a new job. ASAP
😢😢😢💔
Im gtayrful this wasnt Louisiana or Florida
I ain’t gonna lie the cops seem like he didn’t really want to help for real 😒
Poor baby.
God bless this young boy poor thing
Is the doors unlocked bro wtf kinda dumb question is that
oh my my heart hurts for the fear that boy was feeling of losing his mama and not being able to do anything i’m so happy she was taken out and is recovering.
That’s right up the road in West Orange.  Five minutes from my house.  Wow
Praise God 🙏
Could he walk any slower
That cop didn’t do much. He could have stayed where he was
✝️💕
Everything for a Reason!  They’re Blessed and this is a Heroic boy
I have epilepsy. Ive always had the random hard body jerks but just like 2 or 3 at a time. Then August 2010 i had a barely 5 and barely 8 year old kids. We left Oklahoma for southern Louisiana to spend a week woth my cousins. We got there close to 1 am. I got the kids in bed and took my meds. Then grabbed a cold bottle of water and went outside to have a cig with my cousin. After I finished it I said i wasn't feeling well. I stood up and just made it to the door when i started having a seizure. I knew what was going on. I fell on the chainsaw blades and could feel the pain and could feel the door handle in my hand. I came to and walked into the house and slid down the wall to sut on the cold concrete floor in the kitchen. I remember putting my bottle of water into my tennis shoe and the next thing I remember is my cousin slapping me and yelling for her husband. Ive had a few big ones since then. My last big one I broke my foot and somehow came to sitting on the lid of the toilet. No clue how that happened. I still have the big annoying sometimes painful jerks but I haven't had a big one since summer 2022. Keppra has helped SO much. But all these years it has worried me that it will happen when I'm driving. Thankfully I've learned what I feel like before a big one hits. I don't drive out of town unless someone is with me. Shoot the only time I'm in a car alone is if my Mom doesn't ride with me to get my oldest from work 4 days a week. I sure hope this Momma is ok.
Now how is somebody trapped under water supposed to answer when asked "is somebody there"?
Angels come in many guises
🙏
Poor kid. I hope hes mom is good.
That's terrible the cop had no sense of urgency smh 🤦🏼
Help ❤this❤man save❤this boys ❤Mom in jesus name❤Amen 😊Amen😊
You don't ask questions you jump in
He telling you his damn mama in there this is what’s wrong with clear American ideals this young man is a star I hate the dismissal of trauma child soaking wet on a Texas road telling you his mom is having a seizure and you arrive to the car and say is she in there as an ex  Texas  law enforcer I can sadly say I’ve seen this behavior before. I’m glad that this guy actually went and assisted the people who are already trying to get out of the car thank God for this young man and the officer.
Oh my God
How many times you gotta be told? Then your still just all causal about shit.
God is
What I don't understand is that if a black person come and ask a policeman for help you got the damn nerve to ask questions and and ask the car that's upside down is there anybody in the water if it was a white person or even thought it was a different color your ass would have jumped in already stop being stupid and help
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
this made me cryyy😢😢😢😢
Good job guys and child.
I felt so much pain for her & her son. I am so relieved to hear that she is recovering. Her son is so brave.  There is no greater love in this world than our children.  God Bless you!
God bless that family
😢
Omg I hope his mother is ok. That child’s cry’s broke my 💔
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Nice save! All the way around. Respect to all that saved mom. Especially God.
Boy cries for help tells a cop she is trapped in the car in water desperately and he goes up to it and ask “is anybody in there” ????????? I’m sorry but why there is so many levels of stupidity that was brought to my attention when he said that for one. The hell a person gonna hear you trapped in water in a car two the boy just told him 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
The officer sound like a receptionist at a hospital and somebody just came in with multiple gunshots to the head and chest dying in his face and he still asking for insurance🤔, that's if you ask me🙄. God bless that kid and his mom🙏🏽
I have never been moved with this pain from this son's desperately crying out for her mother.
PRAISE THE LORD GOD BLESS US ALL IN JESUS NAME THANK GOD A MAN JOHN 3:16 JESUS FORGIVES HEALS AND SAVES
I can't imagine how stupid you'd have to be to come upon that scene and ask the stupidest question, TWICE! I know they only hire morons to be cops today, but Jesus Christ that was dumb.
She was having a seizure? She was not supposed to be driving period. Valuable lesson for her to learn she could have killed her and kids. She’d had them before the boy called it out because he knew exactly what happened. Lady get your 16 year old hardship license and let her drive you around. 🤦🏽‍♀️Thank you Jesus. 🙌🏾🙏🏾
Cop taking his sweet ass time
😢❤️🙏❤️
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Is there someone in there, yeah no shit
If the cop didn’t take so fucking long to get in the water.
Thank goodness 🥰🙏🏾
Not a good samaritan, if a cop doesn't do this then they shouldn't be a cop.
Asking a bunch of dumb questions!
he is stupid to yell if there is someone in the car the boy said my mom is in the car help her
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Even in distress I understood everything he said clearly. So glad someone was there to help this family.❤ Thank you officer 👮.  Blessings to all involved.
Why is she driving if she has epilepsi 😔
Is somebody in there. Obviously bro
ESTO HA SIDO EL RESULTADO DE LA PLADE...MIA ATAQUES IMPREVISTOS AL ❤ O CEREBRO , LO HE VISTO EN PERSONAS MUY JOVENES COML NOS HAN MENTIDO, PARA DISMINUIR LA HUMANIDAD DESPERTEMOS ESTAS ORGANIZACIONES DEBEN RETIRARSE  DE LA HUMANIDAD!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
A 12 year old and 16 year old couldn't get their mom out of the car ? Smh
❤❤❤😢😢😢
See, All white cops are racist!!!! So racist he just risked his life saving a dark person.
This cop didn't want to get wet. Wasted valuable time because of that.
Mainstream media outlets will not show this story of a cop putting his own life at risk to save this woman. It would mess up their fake agenda.   Kudos to this rescue team!
What a terrible cop have urgency
That baby was so scared, broke my heart 😭 I hope his mom is doing well. Praying for a speedy recovery.
She could of been thrown from the car or climbed out while the little boy ran to the police. We have no clue gow much time went by since the car went in. Everyone reacts different to every situation. Glad shes ok though.
Shitty cop for sure
This made me tear up. 😢 You could hear the exasperation in his voice. Hey, Little King 👑, you did such a wonderful job. We are proud of you! You have a wonderful assignment in this life. I’m glad your mom is okay, thanks to your courage and bravery! ❤
Man the cop could of showed some urgency
Sissy took that kid 2 times tell you to help
Took long enough to get Ina water
Thank you officer for helping that family
This dude said is the car unlocked🤦🏾‍♂️.. he didn’t care that much at all
This dude is going to damn slow. He wasted ao much time going so nonchalant
😢😢😢😢😢que angustia suerte que Dios manda angeles buenos
Eso sí son policías que dan su vida para salvar otra bendicione
And there are these fools out here asking to defund the police.....
Oh that little boy❤
Boy said she had a seizure and shes stuck in the water "Is she in there? Is somebody in there?" before  even walking towards the water made my blood BOIL!!!!!!!😡 Hope she's okay
Lord please keep your loving arms around this family.  🙏 Thank you Lord and Saviour for watching over them and saving them. 🙏
Poor kiddos
😢😢😢
La humildad es el mayor tesoro de todo ser humano...❤
❤️😥
Defund the police yeah?!?
He said is the car unlocked seriously 😢 break the window.
❤❤
Omg how freeking sad
I hope and pray momma is good and alive salute to the officer and the lady's kids including the officer they're super hero's and they deserve a purple heart for this god bless you guys I pray everything is good
The guys asking if someone is in there as if he would get a response is mind boggling. I pray she makes a full recovery. ❤️‍🩹
Damn this was sad. Thank god for any one trying to help rescue this women.  There is a god and good people still left in this world with good hearts.
Why did the cop say is there somebody in there after the boy already told him?
👑🇭🇹♾️💞💞💗💗🙏🏽👑👸🏻👑🙏🏽👍🏼 LONG LIVE THE TRINITY IN HAITI FOR EVER ! 💖💖🌹🌹💯💯💓💓♾️🇭🇹👑
Thank God they were able to.get the mother out of the car.,before she drowned ,they all are heroes that saved the mother.God bless everyone 🙏🏿 👏 🙌 ❤️ ♥️ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Well, would you look at that? It's a Christmas Miracle! LEO'S that are actually doing something of a positive gain for the community. Instead of them being engaged in corruption, entrapment, theft, criminal behavior, lying, false charges, brutality etc. etc. It's finally nice to see one take action to help a person truly in need. Rather than stand back and call rescue and stand there and wait. Nice.

That cop was not tryna get wet. Why would you ask if somebody is in there after the boy already told you she’s in there?
❤❤❤❤❤ THANK U GOD &&& EVERYONE!!... AMEN
🙏❤️
How that happened??
Thank You Jesus.
He took his time
That boy and he's sister saved their mom ❤...
Tf is up with the cop?
Thank you so much hero Patriot for saving his mother you are her and his hero we need more men and people like you around thank God for you for saving her God continue to bless you sir and your whole entire family 😇💝💜💎
I hate to think that if this was an ongoing sickness and knew better than to drive…or was 1st seizure  and didn’t know his could happen ???
Who was filming this AND NOT HELPING????
😭 I'm in tears, God is so good.
Thank God for this brave young man and the police officer who helped.
Praying for this family and the officer who helped 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank God for Good Samaritans 💞💞💞💞💞💙💙💙💙
🙏🙌💖
Thank you for helping to save his mom!
Todos los que contribuyeron grandes heroes..bien hecho 😊
Raise God praise God and you never know procedure comes on if you never had one or diagnosed with one, but if you don’t have seizures, it’s nice to drive but you can’t drive because you never know when it comes on thank you Jesus and thank you for the person posting that she is OK thank you
Vendito sea Dios que se salvo.
That boy is brave, and strong. I hope this doesn’t weigh too heavily on him for the rest of his life. We often forget that even tho he did an extremely good job getting help for his mom, this must’ve been incredibly traumatic on him. Leaving his mom to go find help alone, not knowing if he should stay and help her or gamble on leaving her to find help. That’s a heavy decision.
Thank the lord they are ok I hope
This baby! Is there a way to donate?!
Back up first
God bless this sweet young man
I hope she's ok.😮😮
Damn i see sometimes they break the glass in three seconds what was he waiting for? 😢
Bring tears to your eyes❤❤❤
Gg lil man you're a hero
👏👏👏👍👍 un énorme Respect a eux
Glory to God many blessings to that child and the cop for helping
Cop: "iS SoMeBoDY iN tHeRe?" Bruh, you stupid?, he told you already when you arrived
That cop was acting slow 🦥
The kid saved his mom first one in the water to help her he was Fearless
Siempre que conduzcas donde hay lagos de agua baja las ventanas de tu auto pueden salvar tu vida.
Duh 🙄 omg yessss someone is in there he went for help dummy! And who care about is it Locke for not go find out! Omg!!! 😱
Damn this mad me tear up and so happy that kid was “quick on his feet “ ran and got help I’m glad a cop was near by 🙏🏾
God bless them all❤❤❤❤
God bless the police officer!! We are all proud of the boy-- of course he wanted his mom to live!!!!, and the police officer did CPR and saved her life!! He stayed calm and handled the situation. These cops do exist. Bless you sir.
Good ole police huh
The police has been on morning shows all week. The Good Samaritan was mentioned but not by name. Praying that the Mom makes a full recovery. I would love to see her and her family on the morning shows just to hear her testimony.
The guy annoyed yelling anybody in there an standing there when the boy clearly said she was wanted hit him so damn bad
Omg Thanks for rescue her
Kind of took your time buddy
Cop rescues woman? I saw the cop standing around wasting time like he worked in Uvalde, while the kid rushed to the water to get her out.   Fuck this cop.
Heros🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Oh my God , that baby cry of relief that someone was going to rescue is mom just got me all in TEARS OF JOY!! A SON LOVE FOR A GOOD MOTHER ULIS UNMATCHED!!!!!
Kid to officer: "she's having a seizure. She's sunk. She's in the water." * goes to scene * Officer: "Is somebody in there?"  Clearly, yeah, somebody is in there. Her son *just* told you she can't respond and is drowning 🤦‍♂️ she almost died due to him wasting time asking dumb questions. Thankfully she's okay after all this.
How is this dramatic 🙄
God I pray she is alright
Le flic n'a pas fait grand chose, il prend même tout son temps, c'est l'autre homme qui a tout fait et regardez comment il soulève le bras de la mère à la fin comme de la m.... de. Bref, bravo à l'enfant et à l'homme civile. 🙏🙏
Thank you Jesus 💖, thank you Police Officer.
God is good
Boy?? Anyway way to eventually jump to action officer "is the door unlocked" ??
What a beautiful story. We all need one another, lets please stop with all of the hate. We never know who we may need or who our love ones  may have to rely on.Thanks for sharing.
It’s crazy that people who have seizures are allowed to drive
That poor kid breaks my heart 💔
KUDOS TO HER SON
😢
God is good❣️Praise God for her children, police, Good Samaritan, the EMS, the hospital staff, and last but not least, Our Heavenly Father❤❤❤❤
This is what cops are for. Not giving tickets for 6mph over
🙏🙏🙏
Cop was in no hurry at all lol
Gracias❤ por la ayuda..
The kid: my mom’s in their help her!  The cop: is there somebody in there?🤦🏾‍♂️
Sitting at lunch and this just brought tears to my eyes❤❤❤❤❤
The doctors say my sister can drive. I am so scared something like this will happen due to her seizure disorder.
OOOOOOO GOD MY TUMMY JUMP, THAT SCREAM FROM THAT CHILD IS LIKE A MOTHER GIVEN BIRTH, PAIN AFRAID AND LOVE ALL IN ONE
Is somebody in there!? No shit, someone’s in there 🙄. What kind of stupid ass question is that and why the hesitation?
This happens every day good cops and firemen risking their lives to save people they don't know
That's why people with seizures are not allowed to drive. Sadly, many people don't report it to the DMV, so they can keep driving. I know people need a license to get to work, etc. But, you never know what's going to happen. That poor boy. Edit: I'm assuming she's had seizures before, because the son knew what she was suffering from. Seizures are probably the last thing a chuld would think of. They would just say she "froze" or "started shaking". It sounds like she survived. I pray the young boy is not too traumatized, what a hero❤.
These children will have PTSD from this experience, I hope they can get some therapy to work through their feelings- So glad Mama is recovering-
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏☝️
This won't make main stream news cos it don't promote d racism agenda.
This cop is lowkey a moron. “Is somebody in there?” Tf hurry and get her
My fear
Praise God she’s going to be ok❤
😢🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
It doesn’t matter if the doors unlocked do your job or find another job playboy
No parking
Man😢😢😢😢
That cop was moving too slow for me
But let's defund the police
Poor baby❤. Such trauma for a young kid.
How’d the kids get out?
What’s “Good Samaritan” about a cop doing his job. He’s supposed to serve and protect the public, that’s what he’s hired for. All kudos to the child for his quickness and ability to communicate in spite of the fear and terror he must’ve been processing.
God bless him 😢❤
Kid will never be the same again
Why the cop act sooo stupid somebody in there. Why else little man freaking out. And run to that car. Walking into the water. I hope she's ok though.
He didn't want to go swimming.
The police delay is unfathomable.
Slow moving cop. “Is she in there”? Sir, did they kid not already establish that? Cops sure love harassing you with questions, but have never actually been good at the listening part.
Awesome Job for the young mans thinking ability and the Officer did not hesitate to risk himself, prayers for them
😢
Cud the cop be any slower
This cop is slow as molasses. Thumbs down to him
Bless his heart! He kept more composure than most adults could have.🥺
Praise God and the officer and the good Samaritan 😮
Praise God for all the child that ran for life the child that stayed trying to get her out and to the officer who helped them. Thank God for them all I pray that all is well.
Tell EMS to step it up is one of the dumbest things police officers can say and they do it regularly out of panic. EMS isn’t stopping at Dairy Queen on the way.
you know how quick i would’ve jumped in that water seeing that poor boy in distress.. giving me anxiety by how long he took to help her
What an idiot
Am I the only one freaking enraged that he’s not moving faster like like what are you doing help
Thats why its important we learn how to swim ......
Bless that police officer
The title should be, kid and bystander save mom while officer does nothing but give the kid a hard time. 😒
Oh that baby.
They taking there time not concerned
So no one is gonna talk about how hard the cop made it for the kid?  The officer gets to the car and ask him is there anyone in there? Then he asked if the door is locked? How would the kid know? Jump in there and save the mom, another person had to come and help. 😮‍💨
The officers urgency got me so mad.  Yelling is someone in there after the baby told you  she is
Thanks to all involved in saving her this should be everyone in this Nation im so Big proud od all.
How that little girl got out of that car and managed to get help for her mother is absolutely astonishing. Girl you are blessed
Cop didn't seem too urgent about the situation
It doesn't matter who, what, or how this woman was saved. This man's life could have ended that day. Just by so freaking accidentally mistake! People like this officer are still out here servicing with their LIVES on the line! God bless you, officer ?? 🙏 ❤🎉
So did the slow walking cop get back out of the water?? Because I see another man breaking the window and carries her out????
U cant park there
Poor baby. Hope everyone is ok..
How in the heck is a kid gonna handle an adult that’s having a seizure? You people sound stupid. He did what he needed to do and that was to get help! Being ignorant is no excuse, it’s actually sad!
I like how it took them forever to actually believe the boy and have a sense of urgency to save her. /s Freaking Texas cops.
Thank you Lord Jesus Christ for giving her a second life sinaoa cjisaqutura gueterano. Amen tongue language. When you talk to God.
why would the cop ask if theres someone in there when the boy ran to him and told him exactly what happened… time is crucial  The boy is a hero!  Cause I think if it was a 911 call who knows if the cop would’ve got his hands wet
You should look up the definition of Good Samaritan and the definition of cop
Dude...shut up and get them out.
How do you know she survived . The time the cops arrived and the time they took to rescue her mama was a hell of a time.
THANKS FOR NOTHIN! You don't give us the end of the fricking story??  kid is screaming 'SHE'S HAVING A SEIZURE!' pointing at the car. And idiot cop: 'iyus sumbuddyyy innn therrrre? iyus the car unlocked?' HOW WOULD HE KNOW? as he stalls at the water's edge, hoping he doesn't have to go in. That's the slowest I've ever seen anybody rescue someone drowning. THANK GOD A GOOD SAMARITAN CAME, THAT COP WAS AN IDIOT! 'git er up here.' GEEZUS.
Wow, so sad🙏🙏🙏
Where's all the "cops are waycisms" comments now?
Thank you so much and blessings
Slow man lol
God Bless You. Now I see if your Epileptic it's No driving for you. After having one or more. For a maximum of Months. Epilepsy is in control when it goes down. I'm a witness.
Amazing🥰
He needs a day off and a bunch of money 💰 😊
What a clever and brave boy ❤ all the love for him and his Mum 🙏🏼
The man already in the water had way more sense of urgency to save his mom. The cop seemed like he didn’t wanna get his uniform all wet and slimy.
In the UK if are diagnosed to having seizures (epileptic) you aren't allowed to drive. It guess the US are more relaxed. I hope the mother is okay. What a frightening experience for her children.
That cop was moving slow as fuck
So glad she was safe by that officers quick action and good heart.
I will pray for this family and you have any good in you, you shall too 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
“Is somebody in there?” Was the dumbest question
Amazing!!! Hero kids, hero cop!!!!!!
All angels came together that day to save that woman’s life, I literally felt the child desperation. I hope she recovers and can take care of her precious angels.
All the hate on that cop is sad. I guarantee all the haters here wouldn’t have risked getting their Jordans dirty to go in there.
The terror in that boy’s face and voice are heartbreaking. Hope his mom recovers and gets back to her family.
Cop taking his dumb slow ass time
Not to long ago Vidor/ Orange were a very “Segregated “ towns in Texas. I’m surprised the little boy got the help he did from the police
It’s so crazy to me how so many strangers around the world come across short clips like this and just go about our day when this will forever be a traumatic core memory for that little boy.. I wish the best for him and his family
That cop did not have any type of urgency in the beginning
She dont need to be driving 😢
God bless them!
Lord I hope she survived, and he received the mental care, and support him through his traumatizing ordeal,🙏🏾🤎💯
Let's be honest , that cop did almost nothing other than ask a few stupid questions and bark a couple orders like he was in charge of something
Poor little guy his desperate panic is contagiously heartbreaking I woulda done all I could to help him… I hope his mama is ok now???
Yo I hate when is an emergency and people keep asking dumb questions. The lil boy said crying please help my mom she had a seizure and she’s in the water while he is soaking wet.  Guy - Is anyone in the car? Someone is in the car?  Yes genuine!!!!
Gosh seeing that boy having just had to fight for his own life to save himself and be completely depleted of all breath and all energy STILL find the will to keep going until his mom got help makes me sooo emotional. What amazing kids.
What a dumb cop
If she has seizures why tf is she driving?
Why he asking the car if someone's in there? I mean bro get in there faster.
Is she in there? Wow
Well thank you police officer for helping these kids get their mom out of that car and thank you for giving her CPR until the EMS got their God bless you you say this lady's life
Cop sure took his time while they screamed for help
I pray that boy against the therapy I help. He's gonna need cause this will resonate with him forever.He loves his mama jesus
El niño es el heroes❤
Help her, please 🙏! 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Thank god for her children being with her god is a good god he had his angels there already for her to be saved my heart felt for her son he was afraid for his mom hes a true hero
Bad part is they might fire this cop for not surveying the are first a new a dude
Boy he sure took his sweet time didn't he!  " My mom sunk in the car pls help her!". Is she in there- meander- Sloth- is somebody in there? ' my MOM pls Help her pls,!  Snail pace-,Turtle trot-- Hey u in ther......Jeez I eonfer how fast he would move for someone  else!  At least it looks like she may have survived....maybe
Oh this poor child and his mom such a horrific tragedy to go through 🙏🏻
This stupid cop his asking if there is anyone in there instead of diving in. The little boy explained to you.
🐷: is somebody in there? Me: nooooo the kid just imagined his mom having a seizure and drove into a pond
And that so called good samaritan took him time dragging his feet, asking if the doors were locked instead of rushing and diving into the water with the same kind of urgency that the young boy had 🚮
The kids cry broke my heart 😢💔  He desperately wanted his mom to be safe and thank God the cops were able to save her . Amen.❤️‍🩹💯💙🙏
They allow people that have seizures drive??
Wow, God bless you all!!! 🙏
There's probably gators I'm that water too and cop said fk it
I thank God for her son, the amazing Officer and EMS workers for saving her life!  There are living SUPER HEROS on this Earth.
How lazy and cowardly do you have to be to see a car in the water and before you go in to save someone you have to ask “is anyone out there” as if they can speak mermaid underwater.
It was so heartrending to watch that kid!! So happy for the rescue!!!!
😢😢😢😢...
Hmm just me or the cop was to calm no sense of urgency?
Sea el q sea ,alabado sea el Señor x poner a estas personas en la hora precisa y lugar preciso, Bendito sean x siempre .Amén
How lazy of a police officer and cowardly do you have to be to see a car in the water and before you go in and save someone you have to ask “is anyone out there” as if they can speak mermaid underwater.
Too many questions at emergency situations . Just go ahead and help her out . 🙄👎🏻
Mannn everybody wanna give opinions so here’s my 2cent$… in order to fully understand what situation you’re diving (literally) into you must pause to listen listen to understand and then spring into action!! He didn’t talk over the baby and he did start moving with urgency… does anyone know how the mom is doing after this?? Great job to EVERYONE WHO ASSISTED WITH THE RESCUE 📣💙🛟
Oh Lord. I pray she survived. God bless that young man.
😮the police was acting mad slow. Wtf move faster
Looked like he was repeatedly trying the door .. but prolly not.
That police officer didn't move with no urgency. Asking dumb questions
Why did that cop take so long to get in the water? Even if she had gotten out before he got there and she was somewhere else, he didn't know that. The kid screamed she's in there, and that good Samaritan should not have been the first into the water
CHILDREN ARE STRONGER THAN WE'LL EVERY IMAGINE. ESPECIALLY WHN IT COMES TO HELPING SOMEONE THEY LOVE. SALUTE TO HIM❤
❤🙏
That must be so scary
What's with the camera- in this situation?
Gator!
Interesting… I thought all cops were racist… and white ppl are systemically racist… why would he help a black person out? Wait a minute…. Has the NEWS… and Democrats been lying all this time? What??? My world is shook! I just don’t know what to believe anymore. Maybe she will be arrested for polluting the water and child abandonment. Since the entire system is racist, the constitution and bill of rights is racist. SMH with that said, Good job officer for being a hero this day in America where one side wants you defunded and less of you because of the color of your skin.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 for child
Took his time
Thank God 😅
God bless 🙌
Oh my heart… what a lucky mom to have such strong and brave angels for children ❤
I totaled a car into an apartment complex and caught it on fire at 21 during my first seizure, but wasn't diagnosed until I had one on front of coworkers at my desk job. Now I've had several strokes, am no longer legally allowed to drive, and can't qualify for any medical or financial aid despite having the memory of a goldfish and being incapable of a normal job or life. I'm in hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical debt bc *murica* and am just waiting for someone to offer to take me out of this realm of existence bc I know if I outright asked that I'd be thrown into another fuckin psych ward - where they'll accomplish absolutely nothing but adding several more thousand dollars onto my debt.  I hate this existence. But even antidepressants are off the table bc they're likely contributors to my seizures/strokes. I'm nothing but a burden to those around me but those people only seem to want repayment in the form of my suffering via continued existence.
Dios mío ❤❤😢
Florida there’s gators in that water
Gets all the way to the car “is somebody in there” are you a frog
😢😢😢😢
He told him that she was in there and he still gonna just stand there and say is someone in there
I always see the heart of mankind, bless you Mr
This policeman is an idiot, don't ask if there's anyone there, just act.
Thank God he saved he got help for his mom. God bless the man that helped him❤❤😂😂 I hope that she's alright.
🥺
This is literally bringing tears to my eyes! I pray that she survived this!
Good Samaritan? That is his JOB TO PROTECT AND SERVE !!!
A "good Samaritan" can't be on duty. On duty means getting paid to do exactly this.
Why are you recording and you sound so calm
Did she make it??
I love how everybody is so quick to call this guy a hero when he walked super slow there's a difference between keeping calm and just plain not giving a fuck the kid is the only hero there
He asking if anyone in there lien they responded
He’s so brave to help
Child is a Hero, and All who got her out. Thank You! Hero's All!!❤❤❤❤
Thank you Jesus  for caring people 😂😂😂😂
the cop though💀 "is somebody in there" BRO SAID HIS MOM IS IN THERE A MILLION TIMES😭
That poor little boy 😢 broke my heart
The child told you someone was in there... help! Ask questions later.
That fucking cop is to carm need to take his job more serious
Poor kid  it he saved his Mom💔🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Muchas gracias 🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂 por salvar a la mamá 😊
Why is he just standing there yelling “is someone in there” instead of going right in to help
Kinda irritating how chill cop is acting "is some one in there" Kid "my mom" Cop just casually walking into the water with no sense of urgency
Great work you’re definitely a credit to your profession
Holy cow what a brave little boy. Poor mama. I’m always so terrified of driving and having a seizure or something and not being able to help my kids in the back seat. I’ve never had one..but u never know what could happen.
No se ve nada ! La pudo salvar?😮
Wow that Awsome
God bless ❤
Whats with the stupid questions ? Just go and help her
wtf was he doing standing there asking “is there anyone in there?”
Thank you Lord Adonai !!!!! Thank you for using those brave kids and the persons who arrived on time to save her !!!Thank you!!!!!
Lors help her
Obviously there’s someone in there - run!
Cop sure did take his time . Some hero 👎
It was the kid who put out the alarm. He saved her.
Praise God for these men
Take your time why don’t you not like someone’s life is at stake
good thing it wasn't an emergency...the lack of interest this cop showed, you would've thought someone was drunk sitting on the side of the rode.
My heart was breaking at the pain and desperation in the kids voice to help his mom 😢! The calm and assurance in the cop's voice was assuring though. God bless and protect kids and the cop
That poor boy and his fear for his momma is heartbreaking 💔
Save tha Car bruh 🐂
God bless them❤❤❤
Why is a cop asking if there's anyone inside if the child already said it was
I'm glad he helped .. but damn I can't help but notice he was not in ANY TYPE OF HURRY..
Not good to drive into lakes
I thank the creator the police was there to rescue her. May the creator bless him for his good deeds.
Firstly thank you Father God in Jesus name. Salute to the young man for getting the help his mom needed and thank you to the Officer who saved the mom from a tragic thing
This is why we need to be objective while giving the police a hard time.   Obviously if they abuse their powers they should be held to account and i agree with mot audits. But we have to remember the Police are also duty bound to put their life at risk to save yours. I've seen it several times.   At their core most are people with good intentions.
Cops slower than molasses
And this is what the news media won’t show you
Is the car unlocked? 🤔
Omgosh seeing that child frantic like that hit home right there,hope he and his momma are ok😢
😮😮
Damn police taking his slow azz time..
yo llore mucho al ver este video eres un eroe tu si quieres mucho a tu mamá y hoy yo comprobé que mi hija no me quiere ojalá tú mami se allá salvado
😢😢😢😢
Kids says my mom is in the water and cop still ask if someone is in there?
That cop didn’t do shit at all.   He just wanted to ask if someone was in the car.
Heroes are everywhere!  God bless him!❤
🛐🛐🛐
Frick hurry up
Police act dum all tha time can’t listen follow orders im sure tha kid said she in tha car 20x not just tha 1x they showed now dum cop get out tha car talking bout is she in there walking slow just dum
Perfect example of cooperation and trust!  Thank you to both for saving this person!
Such  a tragedy , but it shows how this young caring son lives his Mother. I am strengthened to see his guick response to what could have been fatal for her.. Smart fellow and that officer was Heaven sent!
WERE IS THE REST OF THE VIDEO!!!!!
The child is a gift from God ✌️❤️❤️😇😇💪🏾🙏🙏.
Cop said is there somebody in there lol duh his mom fool.
Pull that car out of there,u got big truck
Ohg my God
Ese policia No se queria meter al agua, quien llegua y ve un auto hundido para decir, si hay alguien ahí 😠,  pero si fuera un hijo de él  o su mujer, al ver el auto se meteria al agua sin pensarlo, ni gritaría si hay alguien ahí. Todos esos segundos cuentan bajo el agua.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
And THIS is why it is so infuriating to hear people vilify our police officers!!!
Let's Look at THIS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE   IF HE DIDNT GO FOR HELP WHAT IS HE?? SO IF HE DOES WHAT ANY NORMAL PERSON WOULD DO--HE,S A HERO, Right but what if fear and 1/2 shock took over and she dies     Because the other option is he tries to save her And Succeds or Dies Trying   The Cop is very very slow to help  and what if she was DUI Driving that caused all this...
Lord bless this family! And bless the officer who reacted without hesitation ... Sir, you deserve to be reconized as a hero as well! Great job saving a life !!!
Anyone in there? Gurrrrgle gurgle. What?
😢
Ditemi che sono tutti salvi....
God bless law enforcement
I KNOW ITS HEARTBREAKING MY SON SAVED MY LIFE WHEN HE WAS THE SAME AGE I WENT INTO A DIABETIC CRISIS MY SON RAN ACROSS THE STREET TO GET HELP ITS TRAUMATIZING FOR A YOUNG CHILD TO GO THROUGH THAT MY SON IS NOW 20 HE STILL HAS ANXIETY WHEN HE KNOWS IM ALONE I HOPE THEY ARE ALL DOING WELL ❤❤❤❤

The cry of that child!!!😭😭😭 I pray everything turned out good!❤❤❤
The kid is literally screaming to help her and dude is asking is anybody in there 😂 like wtf!!!
Don't drive anymore if a Seizure could happen while doing so.
DETAILS/UPDATE: Jonquetta Winbush, the Texas mom and her two children, 16-year-old daughter Bri-Asia, and her 12-year-old son Dwight, were on route on July 24 in West Orange, Texas when Winbush had a seizure and veered off the road. Dwight was able to swim out of the car as his sister told him to call 9-1-1.   Police officer Charles Cobb arrived, as you saw, flagged down by Dwight. The officer was able to punch out a window but it caused water to flood into the car. A few drivers also on route, saw this happening, and jumped in to assist. They eventually got the front door open and pulled the lifeless Winbush out and began CPR.   On scene, they were able to get a pulse, ambulances were called, and Winbush spent 3 weeks on a ventilator where her sister Bevnisha Holman reported she is getting stronger and now breathing on her own.   Bevnisha personally thanked those involved for helping save her sister, and care for her niece, and nephew.   The city of West Orange honored Cobb and the good Samaritans on Aug. 13 with a life-saving award and letter of commendation.
In THOSE waters!! Glad she made it
This was the worst rescue I've ever seen  Stupid cop asking the kid is the car unlocked. He was acting like he didn't want to get wet. 😅
This brought chills that God for that child and the officer.
“Is somebody in there?” Nah we just threw a car in there and sent a really good child actor to get you so we can prank you into wetting your pants….. appreciate the rescue but time is ticking man!!!!
He knew exactly whatcwas his mothers condition and did all he could in his ability to save her!  Young Man , young man you are Blessed
People with seizures should not be able to drive.And this is a plain example why
Team work, hats off to them both for a speedy and efficient rescue. Brave son and officer and his cpr. I'm glad to know that she's recovering.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
🙏
Sin el celular no hace nada. Dejate de joder
Thanks Be unto The Lord Jesus for placing the right people at this crucial time in rhis woman's and her son lives!!! Praise You Lord Jesus!
🥲😲😱🙏
Oh my goodness please help them
Hes not a good samaritan thats literally his job
I'm thankful for her survival but the officer asking is anybody in their when the kid is crying telling him his mom had a seizure and is in fact in the half submersed car is just mind blowing. Instead of wasting time asking dumb ass questions how about jump in and break the damn window unlock the door and pull the woman out. Seconds count when someone is unconscious under water. Fortunately even with him being incompetent she was saved. I just pray she doesn't have brain damage after that amount of time. God bless them.
❤❤
My heart ..Thank you officer and yes he saved his Momma's life
Poor kid he was in shock and got the courage to get help for his mom or who ever was in the car god bless him
Ty u guys pray 4 up date in prayers
Mi niño esta muy angustiado .gracias que encontro gente buena ❤
Take God for people like him.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️
Yell out to me are u drowning hello “blaaa blaaa guuugglellee hello sns soak w Meeee!” Like wtf!!? 😂 I’m right here officer doing the backstroke like holy f
Policeman moving wayyyyyg tooo slow!!!!
Is that poor Charger okay🥹
Bro if i was that kid bro i would be freaking out to
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
So… did she make it?
✝️🙌🏽🛐
Cop kept good composure
А телефон из рук не выпускает!(
God bless that helpless  child pleading for help. I pray the mom survived.  God help us all.🙏🙏
Dumbass cop, couldn't take the boys word for it. SMH
Wonder what caused her to have a seizure hopefully she received the right help in time  it was lucky the boy was able to safely get out  and alert someone
Whoa heartbreaking drama. Thank God for the people who helped save this person .
That kid is the hero too. Everyone fought together. Damn, this is scary, those kids love their mom.
Don't say cop is a hero he those it give a crap ask if someone is there good thing o good Samaritan was there
Thank you!
I am so overwhelmed! That was a scary event and this young man had the courage and strength to  get help! Thank you Lord for these men!!! ❤❤
Bravo aux flics US.
She literally told you someone is in there nd you're there asking if someone's in there...If you don't have the guts to jump in without questions then you shouldn't be a  cop. Flat out simple. Cops shouldn't be afraid of danger. Cops should definitely be only marines or navy seals.
A story the mainstream media will never tell us. This should go national. Sadly, I know it never will. Let's all thank that officer and civilian for their fast reactions.  Let's also pray for a full recovery of this woman and her family. God bless
I'm so glad she's ok!
Awesome
Thank you Jesus ❤️❤️❤️
Not to be stupid but isn't there supposed to be fucking guardrails around water near any roads... I meant it's common sense right? States will cut cost and do anything to save just a few bucks what a sad reality
Praise God the Officer saw no color!  Live unity!!🎉
I wanna know how is he brave when that's his job to risk his life but will cry officer safety after he shoots or beats up someone
Racist police again causing trouble as usual
That lil boy is going to grow up doing great things and will always be there for his mother. Great job kid. You should be very proud of yourself.
don’t say the cop saved her. the good samaritan did. he walked over with no sense of urgency. i’ve seen cops sprint towards people who are passing out but he can’t even run to save a woman who’s drowning in a car ?? she’s fully submerged and who knows how long she’s been in there. there was no sense of urgency from him at all. shameful.
Oh Wow, Glory to the most High 🙌🏽 for Them. 😢😢😢😢😢
I understand the cops staying calm but holy shit move your ass .
A lot of people mad are with the officer. The boy didn't mention if she was in the car at first, she could've been in the water outside the car. There could've been more people besides the mom either in the car or outside in the water. If the car was unlocked he might not need the punch tool. The boy was panicking and didn't answer half the questions. Other comments mention a man in the water already, that was trying to save the mom, which the boy didn't mention. The video skips around so many details are missing. The officer radios for EMS and runs to get the punch tool which is crucial. Despite all that, everyone seems to think they know what's going on.
😢😢😢😢🙏
If you ever find yourself in this position, do not open the door or roll down the windows.   If you do - the car will fill up with water fast.  Instead get yourself into the back seat and break the back window and crawl out.  You might have a few cuts but it is better than drowning!  💖✝️🌻🫶
Free Palestine 🇵🇸  Stop genocide  Stop aipac whose control congressman who send more money (your taxpayers) in Israel and today send your boys to defend Israel… open your eyes your children will be die for Israel… your children may be tomorrow will back die
That officer is way too casual about this shit. Have a sense of urgency for Christmas sake bro
Jesus🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Dang that cop should stop with the stupid questions and get to the car! Is someone in there? Is the car unlocked? Shut up and get in there and do the job u r paid very well to do! Poor kid dealing with that!
Who Carrie’s an under water phone with them? If they make them can you afford it. Why didn’t they show her body.
GOD BLESS
Sao ông này ko cột dây vô đuôi xe vô xe mình rồi lôi xe lên?
If this was central florida, you would be hard pressed to get someone to wade in a pond.
🌷 TREMENDAMENTE EMOCIONAL!!! Graças ab DEUS, através dele e das pessoas,  salvaram sua  Mãe!!!🙏🙏😁 AbraçoS.💐💖
Ppl who have seizures shouldn't drive.
I wonder if the policeman would have hesitated and questioned again and again if there was someone there if the obviously distressed and terrified kids would have been white.
Thank You, God Almighty 🙏🏿
My heart just sunk so bad seeing the desperation on that baby’s face. I hope his mom is doing well and he never has to face anything like that again. He should be recognized and rewarded immediately, if he hasn’t!!!!
Man this hit me hard due to me suffering from seizures. Everyday I am scared to drive out of fear of killing someone else or killing myself. All I do i pray before I get behind the wheel
God bless this family 🙏
That cop askin all them damn questions
Cop definitely didn’t wanna get in the water lol
Why tf you driving when u can have a seziure at any time. Ppl are stupid
She’s having a seizure it sunk “is someone in there???” *causally wades into water* what a dumb cop this infuriates me at least have some sense of urgency that’s obviously someone’s mother
He saved his mother's life and found out that character is not indicated by race or skin color. Two heroes here and God.
❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢
Womdering how she ended up there, does the car not have a brake pedal, was she ran off the road, was she on crack, etc.  What is the full story.  Glad boy did not lose his mother and she will be okay.  You just never get the full story, ysually just enough to support a law suit.
A real officer of the law. God bless you and your family Sir🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🫡🫡🫡
Good thing we defunded the police huh
Damn that cop really didn't want to get wet.  For all the people thinking he's a hero, I'd say if he is he's a very reluctant one.  I don't see a hero. I see a man who's literally doing his job.
This cop is a goofy…”is somebody in there?” Smh
Praying she's ok,thank God for her son❤
That poor kid 😢 what a traumatic experience this must have been for him. I hope the mom survived 🙏
Is someone in the car?  The boy told you his mama was in the water god damn
awesome young too get momma some help God Bless the FAMILY AMEN
Fucking cop, how brave! Kid just said his mom is in the car still, but there he is "Is anybody in there?"! wtf?
THANK YOU SIR!!!!
His momma might be prone to seizures he knew what it was in Canada you’re not allowed to drive for this very reason.  She should be counting her blessing she could have killed someone’s innocent with her carelessness.
Saving his mother
And the little boy
And they still keep on hating cops 😂
God bless you these peoples
Moma can't drive. Probably drunk at the time. Needs jail time.
Idziesz ratować i nagrywasz 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Omg that little boy was so brave 😢
Yo cops a douche could you move any slower
🙌🙏
What would women do without men.
Screams alligator territory. Brave responders
The boy broke my heart
The police not a Good Samaritan it’s his job which he was barely doing , kinda slow
All I can think of is if that's Florida and them Gators is out, not me nope.
Slow down officer. She might make it.
That cops a pos its obvious he wasnt wanting to jump in that water
Is someone in there said the blind man to the def man 😂😂😂
Oh the love that lil boy has for his mama is untold!❤
Thank you, Sir & to the son, my prayers go up for your family.
The cop but I just iron this pants and plus the water look black
My friends mom passed from having seizures. he said he always slept with her and for the first time he told her he was too old at 12 years old and he wanted to sleep in his own room, and she let him. She ended up passing away. I dont think he ever got over it. He blames himself. he was his mom's world you can tell she was his.
That cop sure took his time getting in the water
😢 this got me crying 😭 that baby went for help an tried to help her out  the car 😢😢 I 🙏🏾 pray she made it through this ,
This cops slow as hell I would’ve been in that water so fast what a joke
He sure took his sweet time
This was one of the slowest responses I’ve ever seen. Hopefully she made it.
Her name is Jonquetta Winbush.  This happened in West Orange Texas.  She spent 3 weeks in intensive care but is now breathing on her own. She is still in the hospital but is expected to make a full recovery.  Her kids (12yo son and 16yo daughter) definitely saved her life.  After they got her out of the car, the officer had to do CPR to get a pulse and revive her until EMS arrived.
😭She’s having a seizure. Please help!? They didn’t have to do it but they did! Amen! 🙏🏽 God bless the rescuers! Thank God the rescuers weren’t in any danger! Thank you for letting us know they found her. We need to be ready to help who, if, and when can, if that’s all we can do is dial 911, or the non emergency police. 🚨 Stay safe. Thank you! God bless you!
Honestly triggers me so freaking much how he had the nerve to ask if someone was in there after the boy just said there was.
Orange Texas is right on border with Louisiana. Probably alligator infested water, too.
Can i see your registration first maam
A day both gentlemen will remember. Bless them. 🙌🏾
Is somebody in there😂😂😂
good heart exist 💯
Is somebody in their  The car na I just drove my self in here ...
The kid is screaming desperately that somebody is in there...and the cop keeps asking 'Is there somebody in there?' Bloody hell...🤦🏻‍♀️
She wouldn’t have had a chance without her son or the police rescuing her. Hope she survived.
Please don't get the cellphone wet. Smh. Recording this would be the last thought on my mind. Saving all the occupants would have been prioritized. But I can only speak for myself when I say this.
I pray to God this boys mother was saved in time ❤️🙏 God bless this little hero ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
“Is somebody in there” 🤦🏾‍♂️
👍🙏
It feels good to see a police officer who is willing to  "serve and protect" the people.
💔🙏🏽
Too many sad videos I've seen today..
Adorable boy, your mommy is alright now. thank God for her and for the person who helped you. By yourself that you are so brave
Thank God that cop was close by.  That child will never be forecer changed by this incident.
Ppl with those type of illnesses shouldn’t drive.
This guy should NOT be a cop. He dodnt do shit, the bystander is the hero and the little boy. That cop is incompetent even asking if the car was unlocked with literally casually walking towards the car... This makes my blood BOIL
There is something so great about men and how they jumped into action. It’s a quality that I have seen exhibited in every race of man. It’s even evident in this little boy…Thank you God.
Why don't show if she alive or not😮
Why are cars so hard to get open in water ?
MAY THE LORD BLESS YOU AND WATCH OVER THE ONES YOU LOVE...
It's sad that they pet people have licemce even tho they have seazures. Goverment should organise a company that drives around folks with disabylitys like free taxi or something.
What y'all see here is a normal mother and childs love. Normal reaction from the child and help arriving at the perfect time. Now that my friends is how my GOD works ALL THE TIME
Is she in there? No the kids lying you dummy. Just hurry tf up
Su accionar salvó la vida de su madre!!!!❤❤❤❤
That little boy crying too lo me out😢💔
My mom is having a seizure, help , officer is she in there , is the car unlock kmt smh Hurry up and save the woman u stupid
God bless you young man 🙏❤
Didnt know they hired retawded people
And they says ACAB 😀 clearly not
His bravery is commendable, kudos to the young boy
Anyone have an update??
Poor baby! 😢And then the officer didnt help at 1 st probably making the boy feel like the only person on earth ,so alone to help his mom at that very moment. Theres not time to be hollering with someone seizing in WATER IN A CAR!!!! MY GAWD😢!
Why’s the cop asking dumb questions. Go see! That’s your job as a public servant. Protect and Serve the people. Time is of the essence especially if she’s under water. Geez. Good thing others jumped in to help! ❤
And they say "all cops are bastards"...
What a brave little boy. Thank God  they listened and got her out. Hope all is well
I'm so glad they are ok poor little kid God 🙏 bless them
Thank you! Praying for a full and complete recovery. Blessings to this young man and the two other people who saved her.
People would go nuts if they could fix bugs for game time
The cop showed bo urgency. He was asking the dumbest questions. Occourse somone is in there hence  the gir in the destress. Then he asked if its unlocked, whtat difference doea that make, just get out there and check. It wasnt l till the civilian ran out there, that the cop decieded to move hia fewt.
Seems to me the cop didn't do anything
Wie tragisch 😢, aber Ende gut alles gut. Danke schön.  Der kleine Sohn tut einem so Leid. ❤
Jesus ! Look at that child's face ! I hope this turned out alright 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Thank you so much beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤
Not sure on the entire video but from this short the cop looks pretty pathetic
Respekt
I pray this young man and his mother is doing okay, and for the officers assisting.
😢
Stop asking questions and save the woman
Aren’t you meant to break the back window and climb through there?
All praises to God!🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Kid: My mom's in there.  Cop: Hellow! Is anyone there?
"Is she in there?"Is somebody in there?"  YESSS THAT BOYS, MAMA. HE JUST TOLD YOU!
Oh my God, that little baby trying breathlessly to explain his mama is in the water, it struck my heart.
Touching video…the desperate cries of the boy for his momma had me in tears 😭
That cops couldn’t care less…
Fire him
Cop certainly was in no rush. 😢
The little boy said she was having a seizure and this dumbass really called out to the car?
For 1 second i want to thump the police officer for asking stupid questions. Oh my goodness what a sweet soul!!! God bless that sugar pie for saving his mom ❤❤.
Felt like the cop didn’t want to do what he had to do
How did the kid get out of the car?
Cop did not want to get wet for a black woman, plain and simply. Guy took his sweet ass time
ΕΥΤΥΧΏΣ ΤΕΛΟΣ ΚΑΛΟ ΑΠΟ ΟΤΙ ΚΑΤΑΛΑΒΑ
Is some one in there.  ... the kid just TOLD YOU HIS MOMMA WAS IN THERE
God bless this boy and this officer and the victim ❤
That poor boy.
This is why talking to and teaching children like they are capable is so important, because they are and they can do so much good with the knowledge and power that comes with being informed. GenA is amazing.
Hope ur mom is ok young fella ❤
tbh the cop was so hesitant. seconds matter in situations like this.
Cop was so slow at first
❤
Not the cop running to save a life
The cop at first didn't get wet. "Is somebody in there?" The crying child is telling you she's in there bro.
That little boy was the real hero he saved himself and her bless his heart. I hope his mom was ok
He seems way too freaking nonchalant for the situation at hand. I totally understand being calm but this is life threatening. That baby is scared and desperate for his mama. I pray she's okay
This baby cries for help 😢....and the officer , thank you for hearing and helping ❤️
lol he litterally asking before checking asap.. 😅would u ask with the corpse too? are u dead enuf?😂
Future gang member you say” 🤔🫡
That kid is a legend... Why the f*** with that cop ask a kid if the car was unlocked.. and then ask the kid if somebody was in the car after the kid was saying quick hurry hurry help my mom's having a seizure she's in the car.. who trains these Muppets
Officer a bit slow getting in the water.!!!
She shouldn't be driving her car putting her kids in danger it could of been a lot worse with her having seizures
July 24 is my birthday and I cant believe this happened on my birthday.
That cop was almost waiting for her die instead of doing his job.
That cop look like he didn’t take that boy seriously in the beginning like his instincts were very slow. (Based on my pov) I hope everyone is okay. ❤
Dear Lord tell me she is alive please poor baby 😢 hurts my heart to see him desperately asking for help for his momma
That officer doesn't move with any intentions unless it involves a fuggin donut... wtf took dude so long to act?
Bro said is somebody in there
Why is the cop in slow motion?
Cop thought twice about stepping into the school  i mean water.
God bless them. Thankful she's ok
Oh, my sweet boy. GRACE and BLESSINGS to this family. I hope they were able to save mom 😢😢😢😢
Is she ok ?
What a brave little boy ❤ the way he cries for help broke my heart 😢
God bless his child, his mother and this police officer
I am wondering how does he get out of that car😢 in order to look for help?
Bravo bro ..bon travail ..Led fend qui parle ta pas fait vite ta pas fait sis sa ...vos gueule..rien ne serre de paniquez ..c un héros stop ...qué dieu te béni et.protege
I assume the cop hesitated because he is not a swimmer.
My God! You can tell this kid was extremely worried for his moms life🥲
Is she in there?? NO ITS HIS XBOX IN THERE. Kid is CRYING OUT FOR HELP, WHAT a STUPID QUESTION. AT least he saved her. As much as he was blaze about doing it.
POV: hears voices from car. “IS THERE SOMEONE THERE!?”  Idiot cop
Is someone in there? I just ran out of breath get in their and save my momma I tried !! I can’t !!! The fear and hurt in that little man’s eyes 😢😢
That cop definitely took his sweet ass time even though the first thing the kid told the cop was "she sunk she's in the water."
God these cops move so slow, i’d be running towards the car the second the kid told me
She passed from drowning😢
Praise God! Praise God! That baby whaling cries saddened me. We Thank God.
Looking at that baby's eyes and seeing how scared and desperate he was brought tears to my eyes. He's the real hero here. ❤❤❤
“Is somebody in there” bruh she told
I would have sprinted to that vehicle.
why do so many people seem to have a problem saying THEY BOTH SAVED HER ??
Mr cop needs more pep in his step. Come on man move your ass
A hero !!! God bless him !!!
Now the poor man that helped will be excused of racism and lose his job . Their is an activist mob outside of his hone.
that cop didnt listen to anything the kid said. and took his sweet ass time. he didnt save anything the civilian did. good on the civilian and that brave kid.
Godsh,tje kid is telling him that hi's mom is in the car and police oficer stil asking if she' in there,COMO ON OFFICER REALLY????😢
what a good boy and a good man
Anyone seen an update on the mom? That kids reaction alone you could tell how much he loves her. I hope she made a full recovery!
God bless them 🙏🏽 ❤️ 🙌🏾
Thank God for that officer And her Son😢
❤
Bro had 0 sense of urgency, the driver side was almost completely submerged
Cop had no swnse of urgency....
God I hope she is okay! 😮
That poor boy.
why you asking is someone in there?! YES, SHE IS SINKING! GOD BLESS!
Thank God for helping 🙏 people in need 🙏 and thank you guys amen you 🙏 guys are are will be blessed 🙌 😇 🙏 amen ❤️ 🙏
She Did Not look alive and he took way too long if she was underwater there is no way she survived.
Dumb SSA cop that baby is telling you hisother is in there. He took his slow ass time gerting in the water. Then is asking "is she in there?!" "Is somebody in there?!" And that baby is saying "MY MOM!!!" That cop pissed me straight off, DAFUQ!!!
That's fuckin cop don't care an just walking ,, even asking ? Too.... If it's a emergency you run to help the ask ? Later... stopped popoooo
When cops do incredible things like this, you give them a week off with pay to recover😢
God Bless that boy ❤
Cop taking his damn time
Kids screaming my mom's in the car. She's drowning cops. Response is there someone in there.... Nonchalantly walks over to the car in water
Congratulations baby boy
Omg! Thank you Jesus, but which phone do this video under water.
Amen
Who was taking the pictures under the water. 😮
Hearing the child crying and trying to save his own mom while the cops asks "is there anybody in there" this man helped but wheres the common sense😂 whos gonna lie like their mom is in a car in the river
Sorry but the cops urgency is very concerning...
Jesus
🤠is the car unlock ? 😏 Really 😢🤨😵🤯?
Thank god respect police thoes helped family ❤😢
"Is somebody in there?"  Bruh🤦‍♂ He literally had to yell about helping her instead of just standing there and asking if anybody's in there.  Where else she would be?
THERES A STAR MANNNNN 💪
Wow. GOD bless that child and Police Officer!
He could of easy broken the back window.
It sucks when ppl get a seizure on a car ride u.u so sad for them not all have such a cewt hero u.u
No sense of urgency at all by the cop. Wow
I know for a fact everyone in this comment section will have not done anything different. When you’re seeing someone dying in front of you. Probably not gonna be thinking rationally.
How you mean if she is in there? How you if someone is in there ?  🤨
We don't see much of the Mom but she was very lucky.I bet they took her license away.
Took you fucking long enough how many times do they need to tell you someone is in the car
FK No Kid Should Go TiA Situation Like This 😮 But He's Parents Raise Him Well 😊 He's A Hero He's Actions Saved He's Mom And That's So Brave 😮 God Bless Them And The Cops That Handled This Situation 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Poor sweet boy scared to death but his urgency was heard. Hipe she's ok😢
I'm surprised someone would be driving with a seizure disorder.
Way to take your time when the kid is crying begging for help
He's lighting fast trying to save her life huh 😡
The boy is the man all my respect is yours
Cop sure did take his time 😂
You ask too many questions
I’m so proud of this son he had to get out of there to, then get help. I hope he gets everything he wants for Christmas
That poor baby 😢
🙏🏿🙏🏿
That cop didn’t wanna do shit u can see him tryna stall
Ofcourse she can’t swim
Glad he got help and the cop help but baby they took ur license 😢. Hope she ok though
Does anyone know how they are doing? Praying all is well🙏🏾❤️
Omg God bless all of y'all ❤❤❤
Every person hating, damn you bichhh
And later this car is going to be for sell in Germany with low mileage
Another case of strong, aggressive alfa males not minding their business.
Lord have mercy 🙏🙏🙏
Scary situation
That cop seemed like this was not a life or death situation.  Don't ask fn questions  just get in there.
Oh my worst nightmare
I can only imagine what this young man is going through at that moment….GOD bless him and his family,bless his strength..❤️❤️💯💯
ALHAM DULILLAH RABBI ALLAH AMEEN AMEEN ❤❤❤
A real peace officer..💯
Dude was moving in slow motion
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
This cops an idiot!! Why would you yell is someone in there that poor child just told you there was someone in there like omg wtf dude 😮🤡💀
He was so scared yet he doing everything he can to save his mama.hope all is well
IN'NALILA'WAINNALILLAHERAGIHUN
Courage garçon
To make the two guests comfortable , the policeman played Easy E music on the radio on the way to the hospitol.
That cops is a idiot
Bless 🙏🏽
Saw this on the news.  Thank God for heroes in the right place at the right time.
This is the problem with these short video clips. Half the time you don't know what the outcome was.
Thank god he was able to get help. Omg that poor terrified child.
Never in an emergency situation should EMS have to "Step it up" americas ruined
Prayers for the mom & her son. 💙🖤
I don’t worry about myself in these situations, I worry about my kids having to go thru this pure fright.
Thank God for this child hero and this adult hero
Dios bendito pobre angelito,eres un gran héroe mi corazón muchas bendiciones.❤❤🙏🙏😘
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
....but why is the cop taking his own. sweet. time!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????  Even when the kid is standing right in front of him trying to explain what happened, you see him pointing toward the direction. Make haste. Run and talk... FR
❤❤❤❤❤
TF do you mean "IS SOMEONE IN THERE" WHEN THE KID SAID HE'S MAMA IS THERE!!!!!!  That pissed me TF off😂
I know exactly where this is, that boy ran all the way down a police station nearby.
Cop act like he slow
When you have a seizure the oxygen stops going to your brain and on top of that you’re under water it’s a reality that hits home hard!!!  I just can’t even imagine 🙏🏼 sending love and blessings to this young beautiful soul and his mumma 🩵
Why everyone is over looking the samaritan that is helping. He is the tru hero. This wasnt his job or his mom. He just seen someone needed help, stepped up, And carried her out the car.
To the officers' quick actions. Thank you for your services. For listening to the baby. The fear in that baby's voice
Moving too slow if you ask me.
This bought tears to my eyes 😢
🕊🕊🫡🫡☮️. free PALASTINa, dank voor the cop s 👍🏼👍🏼
HE WAS SO SLOW ND CALM SMH
Opens door "license and registration please"
Why is he moving so slow to act
Racist cops again
He's such a good child. How did he get out?
I like how they cut out the part where the Good Samaritan jumped into action forcing the cop to get his butt in gear.
Please don’t drive anymore.
For the people like "why is he so slow? Why is he so calm?" Well for the people who don't know, we are trained to stay calm and access the danger. The cop was mostly likely thinking of a plan to help the mom in the car. The only thing that pissed me off was the cop asking "if anyone was in there" and not "how many people are in there" us first responders NEED to stay calm so we can properly access the danger and make a proper safe plan. If we just go in Willy Nilly we can make mistakes. So would you rather he went in without a plan which could potentially put everyone, not just the mother in the car, in danger? Or would you rather he take a few seconds/minutes to make a proper plan that won't put anymore lives in danger? Idk about you but I'd rather they make a proper plan so no other lives are in danger than them go in without a plan potentially putting others lives in danger.
Why are all police slow as fuck in such situations…. All of them
Oh my God. I panicked just looking… I can’t swim 😮
Well done but pls next time more fast😊
Is sOmeBoDy iN thErE 🥴🥴🥴 No of course not officer, just a soaking wet kid begging for someone to help his mom WHOS IN THE SINKING CAR
So glad to know she made it out and will be praying for a complete recovery.  Praise God❤
Cop didn't do shit
Not to be funny. But I thought that was the kid from shameless at first. Didn't know this was real
God Bless Yall
Did the woman survive this 😢?
He asking someone whos distraught  to many  questions.
Al Hambourg li Allah que des hommes bien sont arrivés au bon moment pour sauver la maman et au même temps sauver son gamin, merci qu'ils y'a des hommes sur terre qui agissent et font du bien sans distinction. J'espère que les hommes et femmes de cette jolie et belle planète vivront en paix ! Mes pensées vont pour tous les opprimés et notamment aux enfants  Gaza Palestine 🕊🕊🕊🤝
Wonder why people who are prone to seizures are driving?
That cop asking an awful lot of questions and moving awfully slow for someone trapped in a car in water and she's supposedly having a seizure
Did the cop move at all ridiculously slow speed for someone trapped in a sunken car?
Why would you video this while trying to save some ones life?
❤️💯👏👏👏🫶🙏
Orange tx is Gator territory
Thank God for good cops. God bless y’all and thank you for your service
Omg 😳🥹🥹😭😭🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻thank you Jesus
Salute to the police officers, it gives me a little faith knowing that most officers are good cops ✊🏾and the son saving his momma life almost broke me. 🥺🥺🥺🤎❤️
The one thing I never like about these new cars is that if they become submerged, they are almost Impossible to escape if inside .
If he was a good cop, he would’ve jumped into the water no hesitation
Is somebody in there, YES he just told you that. Time is of the essence!
Cop yelling from the side of the road.... Fkn serious?
Thank you officers for your service
Why do police officers have the overwhelming fascination with useless questioning? “Is someone in there”? Yea his mom dumbass , he told u…. “ Is the door unlocked” ? Bruh just try to open it 🤦🏽‍♂️
Gracious Lord.
He's about worthless wtf
So much going on today.
Like some stop save here
If my son is not alert like that, I don't want him
Imagine if the boy weren’t there they’d have found a dead mother
Amazing rescue. Thank you for saving her.
OMG 🙏🙏🙏
This gave me Titanic flashbacks. I hope the mom survived.
These are the police are always donate for…… true examples of real men and women that are righteous.
❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
That little hero!!😢❤
Where the fuck was the sense of urgency. Dude casually walking when someone is fucking drowning im beyond disgusted
Is she alright
The cop didn’t do shit lol. A random person saved her. So much for serve and protect. Cops are just the most useless people ever
He's walking wtheck
People who get seizures should not drive cars!
Those police didn't care they would have run real fast if they were whote and not only that he has a little rock tapping on the window. This is so sad 😢😢
😢❤
That cops hesitation was kind of annoying. Like he didn’t wana get his uniform wet 🙄
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Scary, poor boy, That cop mosey’ed over there like he was asking if there was beer in the fridge.
The boy: she in the water Rescuer: is she in there?
How can someone answer while they are drowning? He doesn't want his uniform to get wet, that's why he was reluctant
Amem amém ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤obrigada senhor
This aint no "good samaritain" thats his fucking job.
Thank you God!
Did they get her out? Is she ok?? Anybody know? This raised my blood pressure
y va grabando???????? es alucinante la frialdad de la gente ......o esta mañado o la gente cada vez esta peor
Strong kid didn’t panic
THAT BRAVE BOY AND BRAVE POLICE OFFICER ❤️🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Thank you Jesus for sparing this young man's life so that, you him and everyone can save his mom's.
Hes saying his mom!!! Go!
He's a hero thank God for that cop
How come people with seizures are allowed to drive in USA? It this real?
The cop saw a black kid and thought fuck it
Thank you Jesus
Lord this just brought me to tears. Thanks for the people out here who has a heart
Has an epileptic this is so scary and it broke my heart because you can literally tell the panic and fear and the desperation in that lil boys voice😢 and I can tell you first hand how scary it is to wake up from a seizure and see the fear in your child's eyes
🤗
God is the life safer through these wonderful humans🙌🏼
A cop cant bw a good samaritan ...its called doing his job...and why they hell he just standing at the shore line yelling...jump TF in!
Cops get me so tight....help my mom is in there, my mom is having a seizure.. pointing to the car already in the water...n the cop asking if she's in there🫤
Stop asking and just go in
Bless his heart.
What a brave son,he saved his mom.What a Hero😊😊😊
Gracias a DIOS y a su hijo por salvarles la vida❤❤❤❤❤
Stupid stop filming just rescue her first
GOD BLESS THE YOUNG LITTLE MAN THAT SAVE HIM MOTHER.❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
"Is somebody in there, is somebody in there?" Well duh, hurry the f@#$% up!
THANK YOU. GOD BLESS ALL. A SPECIAL THANK FOR THE COP. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
BLESSINGS to young fella an the good samaritan
“Boy: “My mom, she sunk! Shes in there” Cop: “Hello?, is there anyone in there?”
Sad to see liam like this.
😭 OMG MY HEART JUST CRUSHED HEARING THAT BOYS CRY..GOD BLESS HIM FOR SAVING HIS MOMMA 🙏🏽💕
Cop was in no rush
the kid literally came over to the cop distressed and yet this cop is asking dumb ass questions before approaching the situation
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Good samaritin cop? You mean cop done his job correctly?
Thank God for those brave men,  all.of them!!
God bless America and the poor boy. My heart broke. No parent can hear the screams of a child and not be moved to tears. I hope everyone is ok.
Of course a hellcat
Samaritan
Dude asked if the car was open? How does he figure the boy got out?  If she had been white he would have been in that water without asking dumb questions.
Way to take your time standing next to the water
Thank you for your service
Kids worst nightmare 😢 im glad everything ended good.
Shes had a seizure best kid ever
"Please help save my momma, she's having a seizure. She's in the water!'  The cop: 'Is somebody in there?'  Gotta be the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
Cop definitely didn't want to go in.  Took all his time. Seriously, every second count when you're drowning.
This is my type of cop... Kudos
Cop hesitant asf
Thank GOD her son was able to get help and thank GOD for the people who helped!
And they want to defund these heros. With out our brave police the USA would be anarky
God bless them
Omg 🥺 that poor boy what he had to witness, but he did wonderfully, a real hero!!
Lord Jesus,  thank you for this policeman. Poor baby.
COP: Doot doot doot *kick foot into the ground*..Weeelllll I guess I could get into that nasty water... Buttttt she might already be dead..... Phuck.. I gotta go in don't I... I gotta pretend like I tried.. damnit man. Gotta drive back wet..
Wow your a terrible first responder…::just take your time why don’t you….
Oh my gosh thank you! And To the son who apoye so clearly. Oh my goodness ❤❤❤
🙏🏾
Crazy I work out there an drive by theat little pond everyday crazy😊
My wife takes seizures, and this is what I want from my children.  You spoke up, you spoke clearly, you spoke the problem, you helped your f’ing mommy just like your supposed to! I’m proud of you young man.  💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
❤❤❤
No sense of urgency from the cop. Useless
The police: Is somebody in there? Driver: no officer i’m behind you? Dumb fkin NA cops
Not the specific type of car tho 👀
Wow, we doing scripted fake rescues now 😢
Thank you sir 💯
😮😨👏👏🙏👍
Thank you officers! You do amazing jobs!  Your service is appreciated always!
I fear what would have happen if that Samaritan was there
And rather than just immediately diving in to help, the selfish pig cop doesn't wanna get his hooves wet, and he waits for minutes yelling "hello is someone in there" while the child begs for him to do what the boys mama's taxes are paying for. ACAB
Imagine the paper work
This made me happy and pissed me of at the same time. Is someone in there!? No shit ? WTH!? Moving slow, match that babies energy damnit! Good on the baby boy! And the person w no shirt on. They rescued mom
This cop moves like he has the afternoon to get her out of there, slow lazy cops.
Why drive when you know you got health condition that might strike anytime? Jeez. Was she alive?
This made me happy and pissed me of at the same time. Is someone in there!? No shit ? WTH!? Moving slow, match that babies energy damnit! Good on the baby boy! And the person w no shirt on. They rescued mom
Poor kid glad he saved her
Angels❤
God bless them I hope she made it
Tf was the point of the question... obviously someone is in there
The cop really not wanting to get in the water with that "is somebody in there" 😂
Two heros, the child for taking action of getting help and the officer for listening and taking action to save his mother ❤❤
Young man did right. Thank god. How incredibly scary this must have been. The fact he got out of the car on his own is amazing in it itself.
Bless those involved in rescuing the woman and saving her life
😢😢😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏
Poor baby he stopped the right person. God bless y'all
That cop should have some time off.  May Infinite blessings and miracles surround this young mans family always.
All police need to carry what is called a “WINDOW PUNCH” u put it up against the window n push in n it makes like a little click which is spring loaded n it punches out the window within seconds.. I’ve seen troopers/sheriffs/officers literally beat on windows for 10sec straight n they can’t break the window..
Cops by definition aren't Good Samaritans. They are paid and on the job. A Good Samaritan is someone who stops and helps with zero benefit or reason why they should...you know, kinda like the Good Samaritan did 😅
Hell I thought ge was going to ask for id there for a minute whit his (is anybody in there is the car unlocked)
Snap judgment from this short clip but I'll bet that cop pulls his gun out more then he helps save people. He treated the situation like little Sally's cat got stuck up a tree
Lucky to be alive, unfortunately, she won't be able to ever drive again.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Taking his good ole time….
That cop is the reason she's in tbe ICU like what a idiot dude his response is very slow movements followed with "is she in there" DO YOUR FUCKING JOB AND HELP HER!!!!!!! Lazy piece of shit
See how different it is when it is Who it is and they know what it is. Hesitation and doubt.
I mean, the cop was a little hesitant to get in the water, but glad he was there to help
Took them long enough to move with some FUCKING PURPOSE
Where are the feminist.. It's the son who called for immediate help nd it's a man who sa ved.. Her.. Meanwhile she is safe thank god...
If you scared then just say that sir the child said his mama was in there
Yes to that young man❤
Он стоял и снимал крики в то время,  когда нужна помощь? Бред. Постанова
Whoever this officer is he deserves a trophy for real❤ love you officer❤
THANK GOD FOR YOUR SERVICE 🙏🙏🙏
God bless that little boy he was so scared but strong at the same time! That cop did amazing work god bless that man for saving the mother. Makes me believe in humanity!
The cop slow asl he tellin u someone need help n showin u
Is she in there? Bro that lil boy ain't crying for no reason, get ur ass in the firefight.
Stop asking questions and move for fucks sake
Poor baby
Bless the child❤ and the Samaritan.  The cop does want to be involved obviously.
Lil dude is LITERALLY TELLING him his mother is in the car "iS ShE iN thErE?!"
Why are you fucking asking? GO JUMP IN THE WATER HELP WTF AM I WATCHING.
Yeah the cop took his time to get there
God Give bendición ☀️☀️☀️☀️🍀🙏🏻
That boy loves his mama and is willing to sacrifice his life to save her... he jumped in the water with the officer and did what he could to save her
Walks as slowly as possible clearly not wanting to get in the water somebody in there? Well no shit that’s why your there ain’t ya bud🤣
Is someone in there? DAAAAAAAAAAA MY MOM I JUST TOLD U
Godbless them🙏☝️
Two people to thank the Most High for.   Does anyone know if she made it
Not to sound mean but, people with epileptic seizures should not be able to drive! Seen to many accidents!
I thought that was Liam for a second
Now that was slow response why ask is she in there is somebody in there? She could have died
My hometown. Born and partially raised there
Zero sense of emergency
Mercy Jesus Christ to Jehovah God Almighty. Jesus.
🙏🙏🙏
good samaritan? isn't that his job? he seemed pretty skeptical when the kid was talking.
Um... yeah.. Inevitably a great number of folks out there who don''t appreciate having their cognitive dissonance challenged* will surely take issue w/what I'm about to say, however I speak 100% truth here, & will never be sorry to do so.  And this truth isn't simply _my own_ assessment, but rather is the findings of nearly a centiry's worth of US Gov. commissions empowered w/the necessary investigatory tools, & tasked w/creating reports providing an accurate assessment of the state of policing in America. And despite all three of the commissions obvious attempts to sugar-coat those findings, who painted a picture that started out w/the 1931 Wickersham Commissiion as an incredibly frightening, damning, & sobering one, only to became exponentially worse over the time period leading up to the 1970 Knapp Commission, & ended with the 1994 Mollen Commission's findings(see quote below),** which are absolutely terrifying, & surely have become yet exponentially worse still today, making the truth about American police beyond many Americans courage to even acknowledge.*** As the truth relates to this video, I guarantee that first of all, I'd have been moving a heckuvah lot faster, the time he hesitated for no good reason could easily have made the difference in saving this woman's life.. just thank goodness it didn't. & I'd never hesitate to help in such a situation, & both of these claims I've already proven in a similar situation, however it's nothing special, only the right thing to do, & I'm confident that the same goes for millions of other genuine American men, & many women too. It's not a genuinely dangerous rescue, as far as I can see? It's only a little dirty pond water, no problem there? The more important thing is, though, that if we could watch unedited footage of the incessant lies this man tells, the bullying & intimidation he employs, & the horrific human rights violations this same.. um.. "man"(JBTP!.. a demon, a porcine serial criminal offender, as the commissions I referenced above discovered) perpetrates against good American people every single day in his official capacity as what he incorrectly believes is a "law enforcer," but is supposed to be a "peacekeeper " & "rights protector,"*** & the literal crimes he commits just in being an order follower who knows & cares nothing whatsoever for the Constitution, or the Bill of Roghts w/in it that  he raised hand to God, or placed upon Bible while standing under our nation's flag & swore a sacred oath instead to uphold, any decent human being seeing it would be beyond appalled. This "man," like his criminal cohorts, is not a moralist, or a patriot, he's an order follower & the worst sort of criminal, while deluding himself into thinking he's betrer than, & has a right to dominate, abuse, & rule over the people who he is supposed to "serve," & I know this not only from those commission findings, but also simply because he willingly signed up for, & continues to follow the absolutely brutal, inhumane standard policies & procedures of the organized crime syndicate, the blue-line thug criminal gang of road pirates & literal domestic terrorists that he's a member of, & which along w/only himself, is where his sole loyalty lies, not w/the People who pay his salary & have placed him in a position of great trust that he violates daily, or even to our nation. Worse still, just as those commissions described, & as we can now see w/our own eyes & hear w/our own ears in 10s & 10s of thousands of videos thanks to the modern phenomena of cameras & social media, he also has zero regard for the actual law, & does not feel himself, his family, & his criminal cohorts have any obligation to adhere to or respect those laws, & just as we've seen in countless, never ending cases, he/they will commit any further crimes required, tell any number of endless lies, ruin any number of innocent lives, be shamelessly derelict of duty, anything necessary to protect even the most egregious criminals amongst their ranks. It's very sad that between Uvalde, & the endless other sad & tragic examples we've seen of "occifer cowardice," that we have to consider this any kind of act of goodness or heroism, rather than as his job & the plain decent, human thing for any capable person to do in such a situation? *the same folks who believe that Faux News, or CNN actually tells the truth, or does their jobs as "journalists," instead of letting the "Project Mockingbird," three letter agency supervisors embedded w/the editors of every single major media outlet dictate what pure propoganda to spew, & which stories to ignore, spin, & outright lie about, which is not a theory, but a proven fact revealed all the way back in 1976, thanks to a lucky FOIA request slipping past truth's gatekeepers.. look it up before making a sad spectacle of oneself by denying this fact in ignorance ** " the police have failed at every level to uproot corruption and had instead tolerated a culture that fostered misconduct and concealed lawlessness by police officers." And the Mollen Commission's comclusion "Today's corruption is not the corruption of Knapp Commission days. Corruption then was largely a corruption of accommodation, of criminals and police officers giving and taking bribes, buying and selling protection. Corruption was, in its essence, consensual. Today's corruption is characterized by brutality, theft, abuse of authority, and active police criminality." And that IS grossly sugar coated, as can be seen by reading the full report. Even the small percentage of police who weren't engaged in active corruption & criminality(although their standard procedures & policies are blatantly unconstitutional & absplutely criminal in themselves, so they're all guilty) are nonetheless equally as guilty as accessories, in their silence, & dereliction of duty, & the crimes they commit, lies they tell, & innocent lives they ruin in order to cover up the horrific crimes of their cohorts. **such as the ability to grant immunity for testimony so they could get the raw, unvarnished truth ***they graduate peacekeepers standards & training, & sign a "peacekeepers agreement," not a "law enforcers agreement".. "Law enforcement," is a made up propoganda term that mostly came into mainstream use w/the tragic, inexcusable, originally purely motivated not by any morality, but rather by the interests of big business, & their desire to subvert the free market by suppressing competition from the literally miraculous hen# plant, an indescribably superior, healthier, greener, cheaper alternative to ANY & ALL petrochemical/oil/fossil, timber, cotton, & many other industries, as well as a food source that could essily, cheaply feed the world, & of course provides much safer, side effects free, in many cases more effective alternatives to big pharma's dangerous, deliberately ineffective(a healthy person is no longer a customer, & more profitable to sell a medicine that requires 3-4 other prescriptions in order to mitigate its side effects), expensive often to the point of inaccessibility for most people, highly profitable poisons, in combination with a motive to control people, & sold using lies & shameless racism, & legislated thanks to corrupt, undue, unlawful influence of big biz over lawmakers.
Remember women. When you say you don’t need a man for anything just remember who builds the world and saves lives. God gave us all a purpose
My Heavenly Father of grace and mercy thank you for being there to save and protect that family in the name of Jesus amen 🙏🏼
great young man right there... and the officers
Is somebody in there uhhhhh yeah bro someone's in there
Slow responder.  Move faster than that. Saved just in time .
The officer was amazing also. Instead of taking a life, he saved one. He could have told the little baby his mother was gone and not even try to save her life. But he actually helped and saved her life. How many officers do you know that would have let her die!!!
“Help my Mom”!!! I felt those screams and cried for help😢😭.. glad He was able to do all that for his Momma❤❤
I am really curious why people who experience seizures be let them drive on their own by family? There is a case here in our country driving motorcycle and experienced seizure, struck the grilling around the fountain and hit it on top, eye first and skewed through the head.. it is so dangerous please don’t let them drive alone without someone beside them who can handle the wheels
She’s in there, having a seizure!! Cop : Is someone in there? 🤦‍♀️ thanks for listening.
Thanks god she’s ok ❤
THE DUMBEST POLICE IN THE WORLD WITH THE DUMBEST QUESTIONS HE ALREADY TOLD YOU SHES IN THE WATER
Young man handle that and thank God he knew what to do and thank God for the police officers who was there and the compassion he had and told them to speed up EMS
Vlessings to this man
Damn, when a child gets to a window of a submerged car faster than a police officer…..  🤔 something doesn’t seem right. Was there another officer next to the kid at the window? The video isn’t clear.
I’m so glad he saved his mom he was so scared he made me cry😢 good job young man
Thank God for this young man and thanks to the police and Good Samaritan.
The fact the they asked is someone in there 2 times before anything has me wondering if they even know what a seizure is
What a terrible thing to happen, this poor child’s mother being trapped in the car. I can’t imagine the fear he felt. He was so brave, I know she’s proud of him. Praying everyone is okou😊😊😊
😮😮😮
Where was the sense of fucking urgency SMH
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 thank you god
That poor kid
If somebody  there  fucking  stupid  answer
when a victim helps in that manner dont pull up like your in a line at starbucks dude, get with it. hope to hell if any award is given its to that child
God bless those police officers who saved the woman's life! 👮‍♂️👮‍♂️👍👏👏👏💖
The slowest cop on the fucking force shows up…
Finally, a video where a Black life is SAVED
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Holy 💩! A police officer helping someone 😮
Stupid cop... "is someone in there" "is the car unlocked" 2 stupid questions to ask a distraught kid who's already just cried to u his mum is in the car
Oh heck I hope they're all ok
How do we know she lived ? I don’t see that in the vidoe
😭😭😭👏👏👏❤❤❤🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Praise to that police officer . 🙏🏻
The boy has just told you she's in the water...why would you ask if there's someone in there and whether the car was unlocked?! 😭
This Cop was absolutely amazing!! I can’t imagine how difficult his  job is. They come across so many things that would cause anyone else nightmares and trauma. Many times not always a good ending.😢They are heroes! ❤ the little boy is also a hero ❤ saving his mama. Talk about good timing too. She was not meant to die today.❤ 🙏 😊
Like how is it dramatic
Wow the things that happen in our world
Thank God for good people
If she was driving slowly she wouldn’t be in that situation
🙏Gott schütze Euch alle drei und beschenken euch mit einem guten und langem Leben🙏💯🕊️💫
That boy made me cry his desperation
Poor terrified little boy.  I hope his mom is ok.
Poor kid
Got to rethink them heavy ass Dodge doors bro
The best cello player in the Universe so elegamt is the best 🎻🎻🎻🎻💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Para ajudar, além de um coração bom é preciso coragem. Obrigada a todos envolvidos no socorro. Espero que ela esteja bem e que o garoto esteja com o coração calmo.
the boy said someone was in the car. he should ran to the car.
God Bless 🙏🏼
The boy and the cop together saved the woman’s life God is good all the time . Two angels two heroes saving a woman’s life . Thank you Jesus ❤
He's a smart guy....his mother should feel so very proud..GB ma'am hope all is well
Gracias por salvar esa vida.Pobre niño! Ya su madre está a salvo.Gracias a la oportuna acción de estos héroes
So proud of him. Hope Mom was ok.
Thank you police and Good Samaritan!
Lol why did he ask if someone is in there? The boy told you his mama is in there.
The cop was to calm. Dude get in the water and save the lady.
Sry to say this, you only have a limited amount of time without breathing underwater for your brain to even fully recover.  People that have known seizures shouldn't be allowed to drive at all.  They endanger themselves as well as others.  I watch this girl crash into parked cars while she almost hit mine and nearly hit a guy who was entering his car.. his door flew off while he was holding it... in a matter of seconds.
Omg😢😢🙏🙏
Momma is getting her license temporarily suspended until she is at least 6 months seizure free
Hat er das gefilmt?
Is she alive??
Bad az kid
Bless his little terrified heart...
I like how this short gives credit to the cop and the Samaritan, the only one with a sense of urgency in this video was that brave, young, courageous boy.
Hurry dudes!!!!
ALABADO SEA DIOS, Q ESTE BIEN ESA MADRE
Amen
the cop takes a whole week to start helping
I swear to God if someone make a Starman edit of this.
God put us where we should be at the most crucial times...thank God for these bravevand caring men.  God bless the little guy and his mom ...i hope she is ok ❤
The boy got help .The cop saved her this is America.
As a black man in America…it’s cops like this hero…that makes it so I will never raise my children to hate cops or teach them that all ops are bad…there are some evil ones in the world but I hope that we get to a point where cops like this outshine the others
This is why vehicles with automatic locking doors while driving are just a bad idea all together.
he took his sweet ass time
Shot out to the young man that ran for help for his mother! You did great son!❤❤❤❤
Where is the go fund me for this young man?
What happened in the last 3 mins he got out of the car ? Swam out of the lake and got help ? How old is he . This is beyond bravery.
Ce gamin m’a fendu le cœur avec son cri et ces larmes que dieu le béni
Cop slow asf
I thank God for for the mom ,child, and the police officer ❤❤❤
Thank God for sending the brave hero by at the right time.  Love your neighbor .  Bless him Lord!!
Oh dear dear dear. I hope she’s ok
Wow esto es algo terrible 😢 para ese nene
2° parte.
At least it's not in Florida cuz then you know for sure he's getting attacked by an alligator while he's trying to save her
Thank God for the police arriving quickly to the rescue! 🙌🏾🙏🏽❣️
God bless this boy, the officers for responding to save the boy’s mom inside her car sinking in the water.   Thank you jesus❤❤
This kid is a hero for sure!!
I feel as if the cop could have moved with more urgency, but im glad the woman was saved. I hope she is ok!
Okay, Ill be the one to say it.  "Shes having a seizure, She Sunk, Shes in the water!"  Did the officer think the boy was talking about the car!?  Of course someones in there, he JUST Told you someone was in there.  Yeah, appreciate saving the life but just seems weird to ask that...
Hat happened on my birthday
Omg this poor child 😭😭😭 I wish he never felt that. He musta been so scared 😭😭if he wasn’t with her that day tho…. 😭😭😭smart lil man ran quick for help ❤ poor baby 🥺
We have some really great cops in this world hats off to the ones whom actually protect and serve to keep us safe
Was the cop asking the pond if someone was in the car? Wtf
​@terynb4407 Professionals and experts in any profession, oftentimes will ask questions that lay people don't understand because they (the professionals) have a higher level of understanding and a deeper level of operating and assessing. So sometimes they ask questions that don't make sense to lay people because they're thinking two or three steps ahead of you.   I'll just say if I were in that car, I'd want God to send that same group of people to save me! ❤🎯💯🙌🏽🙏🏽👮‍♂️
Thanks for the rescue,  but the phone is distraction...
❤
That cop acts like he about to watch a tv 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
To all of the people in the comment section saying, "Kudos to the kid, he saved his mom." NO. Kudos to the officer and the man that carried her. They literally saved his mom. I think maybe they might deserve a little bit of credit. Kudos to the kid for getting help.
I remember that i could barely scream to my brother that our nephew or cousin thats baby was getting attacked by our pitbull
PRAISE GOD
i would just like to know how one got themselves in that situation
No es samaritano es su trabajo
God bless that kid, his mom and the officer too, he was an angel
One thing about people they will help out in time of need no matter who you are where you came from I love this 🔥💜💜💜
Women driving....
Back windshield is best way I learned
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
“Is ThErE soMeOnE iN ThErE? 🤡” no shit !! He’s crying. Idc care what no one says that cop was moving way to slow, I bet if his momma was in there he would have moved 5x the speed !!! I really hope he’s not racist
I’m about to cry for the sheer love and panic that child has for his mom. He literally saved her life and also explained the situation clearly even though he was frantic , he gave enough information to get her help.  God love him and thank God his mom is ok. And God bless the people involved who saved her
I hope she is ok. That poor baby he definitely loves his momma
Vas auxiliar alguien deja el p..0 teléfono
Thank you Jesus bless that boy and the cop prayers for that family ❤
f racism..as it goes...we are humans..we save all...😊
😨
w kid
Oh my goodness that poor young man. Why are we taking the risk of driving a vehicle if we know we have seizures? That would be my question. Gladly she was saved by this Good Samaritan
the cop wasn't rushing for anything 😂
women
Good Samaritan is Jesus Ok guys. The levi, tons of different people passed by but nobody helped the man caught amongst thieves in the Bible. He helped the wounded man who became 100% dependent on the Good Samaritan. We should rely 100% on God like the wounded man in the Bible.
Même pour sauver une vie humaine, il faut filmer!!!!! Honteux!!!!!!
Gracias
Jesus thank God for child an good person.
His cry for help broke my heart . I’m so glad he was able to get help ❤
Damn this was hard to watch
Cop has no hesitation to help xD
The cop just wasting precious seconds asking questions that the boy already informed him with prior. Also found it odd he was tugging on the door handle, aren't they supposed to bust of the back window?
Le gars qui prends le trmps de filmer la scene. Quel horreurs
Good lil man right there. God protect him in this weary world
Thank God he was able to get out and get help. God is awesome!!
haha what a surprise a dodge charger. wonder how many trash buckets of kfc are in there
What a wonderful son
Bro give the damn phone to him and go save her! Put your phone away!
✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏
Did she survive????
Why are people looking for negativity. First responders have to assess the situation to do the best and fastest thing. Like which door they need or if they need to break a window.
Oh God I pray this ended well.  Thank God for that baby & the good cop that helped.
Bless that baby!!!!!
That first cop was not even trying. Until someone else showed up. Wym is somebody in there? A kid just told you his mother is inside.
I hope she's OK prayers 🙏
🥺🥺🥺
😢😢😢que valiente niño pero gracias a Dios todo salió bien gracias personas heroes sin capa 😥😥🙏🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
"Is there someone in there" what a fckn m0r0n
That cop went above and beyond what they pay him to do. Serve and protect was next level. That child although frantic kept it together.❤❤❤
“Is somebody in there”…..I think you need a different job.
Was that officer white?
Oooo Bozeeee...
Wow his cry for help just so touching great job little guy. Hope mom doing well.😢
Take your time buddy
From what I see that Cop was pretty useless
Y mientras se ponen a grabar en vez de ayudar. Madre mía🤦‍♀️Así está el mundo
“Is she in there?”  Bro don’t ask stupid questions, get out there NOW!!  You dope
❤️🫂😢🫂😢❤️
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
👦:"my mom is dying!!" 👮‍♂️:"is somebody in there?" 👦:"my mom is there,she's dying!!" 👮‍♂️:"is SoMeBoDy in there?💕"
The title says: “Good Samaritan”  How is this a Good Samaritan? He isn’t acting out of own interest because he’s on duty. People nowadays like to put that phrasing without knowing what it means.
Is somebody in there??? glug glug.
And he was recording.. why?
❤
My mum's in the car police man straight after is there someone in there 😢
God knew who to send a Man of passion  and a Son who loves her.❤
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT'S NOT TOLD AND SHOWNED ABOUT THE GOOD POLICEMEN OF THE WORLD, WE HAVE SOME BAD ONES, BUT THANK GOD FOR OUR GOOD GUYS...I APPLAUD THE OFFICERS AND EMS...🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
GOD BLESS  PRAYERS 🙏 IN JESUS CHRIST NAME AMEN
😢❤ I pray this woman is alive and well
Omg that poor kid thank God they r all ok God bless that child
That the kid didnt let his terror paralyze him is very impressive. What a brave little man!
Police and medical professionals should be respected below the creator,  appreciate police officers 👮
🌹🫶🏾🙏🏾🙌🏾
❤
Statt reinzuspringen fragt er noch ob da jemand drin ist. Was ein Loser
Stop asking stupid questions and do something!!!!!!
Most times it is good to know how to swim   Imagine if that little hero didn't know to it would have been a different story.  Thank God you both are safe and okay..
Why is everyone in the comments saying momma
Jesus, could you move any slower????
That cop can smell problems, right place right time...lad said mums having seizure...god bless you lad🫡
Omg 😢😢 God I pray that she's alive today and well
That cop was embarrassingly slow
Good Samaritan?! Isn't Cops duty to help & protect people?!
Thank you Jesus for the boy and the officer. I wouldn't known what to do, but God sent the right man. I hope the woman is alright. ❤
Thank you Jesus Christ for this good police officers . Please stay blessed and safe.
Omg I am so crying seeing them carry her out n he's desperation I could feel that in my bones
People should listen to what a person is saying. The child kept telling him that his mom is in the car.  Thank you officer for helping the child and his mother.
The good samaritan saved the woman that cop didnt do shit
So horrifying. What  brave young man. Thank goodness he found that officer. This is one if my biggest fears. Hope she was OK 🙏🙏🙏😞😞
Awe bless his heart
You see cop dont shoot black people they help them too.
Excellent Excellent beautiful 🙏🙏🙏👍👌💪
This dude is an idiot is there anybody in there! Stop wasting time get your ass in there!!
Siezure under water means she will not be able to respond when seconds matter most.
"help my mama she sunk in the water"  "Is somebody in there!?"
She's having a seizure!!! Folks with this condition should never given permit to drive...
That poor kid is gonna be traumatized
😮oh no
😢
Is the car insured.. did your mom pay road tax.. is the car legal to be in the road.. is the check engine light on.. are the tyres legal.. all the while moms drowning hes asking dumbass questions
“Is she in there?”. Duhh
Barley saved her
If the woman was having a seizure why the heck was she driving a car? Ppl that are prone to seizure are forbidden to drive.. 😢😢
APTTMHY so thankful for her son's presistence and those Yah put in his path.
✨🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽✨
Although I applaud the cop’s actions, asking if someone was in the car, seeing that the front end was submerged was just dumb!  Come on, now!  Fortunately, he believed the child, but geesh!
God bless you both for saving that woman ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Boys spider senses are tingling
God bless you guys !
There is probly a thousand incidents like this one that we never see. The news only show the bad cops.
Thank You Thank You THANK YOU.‼️‼️‼️

Great  job  little man  I am proud  of  you  for  being  a good  son

Did he see the little guy was in distress. Sir u can access if the car is unlocked when u hurry up and get to the car.  Just saying  duh
Why the hell was the minor’s face not blurred, but the adults was? 😅
NO! no body in there just a drowning lady! Poor boy, he probably wondering why he asked, "some one in there!" Thanks to the guy already there was helping her.
Why do people that know they have seizures and people who care drive in the first place glad she's OK hopefully

This is scary.. i dreamed about this last night. That i was in a car with someone else and he drove in the water and thank god i made it out a live. And now i see this video 😮
I'm just curious about the odd questions before getting into the water.... didn't appear to be much haste ... but hey....
"Is somebody in there" like people speak underwater bro come on
What topk so long
Rev. Mlombi is so broken, the tears, the stress-weight gain, his career destroyed by his wife's selfishness. I wish him peace
Is she safe ???🙏🙏🙏🙏
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

Slow as molasses "is sum body in dare?" The kid told them there was!
God bless that policeman for saving that lady cops sometimes get a bad wrap due to these few rotten apples on the force God bless them all .❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That cop was moving in slow motion 🤦🏽‍♀️
Dude has no sense of urgency to help like god damn stop asking questions and just go help
The Good Samaritan is a Guardian Angel sent to Earth for such a time as this! Hallelujah and Praise The Lord! Thank you God! Amen! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💕💕💕😇😇😇
Is she in there ,don't rush just take it a bit more casually
Let me tell you. Seeing anyone have a seizure is traumatic. Watching it happen that young to your mother,, I couldn’t imagine that. My girlfriend had seizures and it was some of the scariest things to experience, iv had one myself and you don’t really know what happened. It’s like you don’t remember going to sleep and you wake up majorly disoriented with no real perception of time. It’s as if your inner clock or biological clock was off for that time. Once they come out of the initial seizure their brain is in a very odd state. Extremely suggestive, can be coerced to talk about things that aren’t at all real. She was getting them from drugs and I had my suspicions so of course I’d interrogated her when she came too but after a few I started testing her lucidity.  Started talking about nonsense with her and she’d go right along with it. The brain is such an odd thing. I’m just glad that woman was able to keep her head above the water after she came too.  If I had to guess, she either regained consciousness and was nearly submerged and literally had no idea what was going on or she lost consciousness at some point either before or after coming too but doing the seizure your not breathing so it would’ve have been critical where her head was when she came too. It’s like watching someone come back to life. They breathe like they had been holding their breath, it’s explosively quick. Had her head been under I think she’d have died. Thank God. Her business here wasnt done yet. That boy needs his mama. Brave kid. He was in the wreck with her, he’s soaked. My question is, was that police officer close by just by chance? Miraculous
I’m sorry, but wasting time asking “Is somebody in there?” is literally the stupidest f^cking thing ever.
Nandi is really being selfish, destroying her husbands dreams in a quest to feed her ego
GET YOUR ASS IN THERE BRO. What are u waiting for.
❤
Маму срасли, или, нет, я не поняла ?
Thanks to the lil boy and the cop.
Personally I’d feel very frustrated if my hero rescuer insisted on doing everything with one hand because he was using the other to record the whole thing for social media.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Lazy cop
Show this clip to those women who say we dont need men
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Pls...hope his mother was rescued and is well😢🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Hope his mama is getting better  & they can overcome the trauma. Tq to the policeman & another gentleman there. ❤
Does anyone know if she made recovery? A seizure while drowning doesn’t sound optimal.
😢   poor kid. I hope his mom is ok.
That poor child 😢 he must have been terrified!
Omg im so glad shes ok that boy went back in the water with grown men trying to get to her in so glad he doesnt have to live without her 🙏
This is why I say I love cops. I AM NOT BRAVE!  I always end up getting help from the police.
❤
እግዚአብሔር ይድረስልሽ
Praise God 💯
This lazy cop really took his sweet time
If she has seizures she shouldn't be driving
Well since no one wants to give the man any credit I will. Together these men saved that person good job! Thank you for  both.
I love humanity sometimes.  This is one of those videos
Little kid correctly diagnosed the problem as a seizure, not because he's been to medical school, but because both she and her son knows that she suffers from seizures.  Responsible people with seizures don't drive and in some states have their licenses revoked.  This woman not only almost killed herself, but her son as well.
You can't park that there
GOD bless who helps the hapless 🙏
Un gran héroe 👏 aleluya 🙌 👏
My heart😢
My heart goes out to all. Especially, the little gentleman 😢😢😢
NEVER DEFUND LAW INFORCEMENT TO FUND INVADERS...❤
Well she def shouldnt be driving no more. Thankful they got help That poor child
I thought that was Liam from shameless
This lazy cop hurry the f up wtf
Here we see institutional racism at work.
Chillest cop iv ever seen
Glad she’s safe but how did she end up in there?
Heart breaking prayers going up for his mom how sad too hear his crys for help
God bless😊
No one gonna talk about how shitty the cop was at getting this done 😭
Keep good health..nothing matters more.. don't risk with health. stay safe
Bro this cop has no sense of emergency that kid had to basically tell him 5 times that his mom was in the car and then had to tell him to help her twice before he slowly went into the water. This is why I want funding for the police to be way more controlled and have more goals for what the funding is meant for because we give these men and women sooooo much money every year and they barely even help people in car crashes let alone stop crimes so what the hell are we doing as America. We used to be an example of what to do and we have quickly become an example of what not to do.
Is there a follow up.. what happened?
Omg what happened that caused this terrible incident poor child and his mom hope she alright
May hod bless them all. 🙏
This is why I would never drive having epilepsy. I could endanger other people's lives, and I couldn't handle the guilt of hurting or killing someone else.
Probably no Insurance either
It always happens when a car accident,Especially the accident of falling into the water. On the ground, the same thing happened, so that the victim of the burning car was locked to death. and the door automatically locks the victim... A very important thing that car engineers need to take note of
The cop juwt standing there saying is anyone in there to a car under water WTF this made me so angry at the speed or lack there of the rescue this lady id habe had her out before he got his response from the car😡
😢 poor little guy
Officers taking extremely to long to deal with that "extremely bad situation"...
our heroes in blue
Other people in there trying to do something and this knob jockey prancing around. I'm sure he's got something to pop the back window
He taking his time
What a brave young man!
The kid there’s there’s a metal the officer did save her life, but he hesitated. Good job though.
FFS if I wait long enough I will have no liability or something. What's this clown up to? If your going to sort it get it done
why the questions????
Omy god
And THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO DEFUND HEROS WHO ARE GOOD COPS.
Thanks to the boy his mom is alive ❤❤❤
“Is somebody in there?” What the f#% do you think?
Thanks be to God 🙏... Amen😂❤
He's a brave kid ❤
Cops keeps asking like hè wants to talk to dead people
Police was scared
Bro the kog told you the mom is in there and he is like hello ?? Somebody in there say something if u are drowning
What a brave child and the people for helping her God be with the mom and her child
Take your time 😂
😢❤.
Poor little guy what a strong kid though ❤❤❤ thank God for wonderful people who protect us not cause they have to but because they want to do this ❤
Yea her son save her life I don’t understand stand the cop because the young man said my mom in the water and the car and he going to say is anybody in there. When the young man said my mom in the water in the car at this time every minute count.
A sezuire 😢
Dieser Junge hat mein Herz zum stehen gebracht. ein wirklich schrecklichew Stenario!
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
🛐👼🏽🤍✝️
God bless them. Poor baby! I hope the mother & her family are ok.
Cop moves at a snails pace
The cop just talk shit
The boy already told you that someone is trapped inside the car.
if her seizures aren't under control then she shouldn't be driving and driving her kids at that.  i am epileptic and for years i took public transportation to and from work until i got my seizures to stop then my doctor let me drive.  she's irresponsible and selfish.
Wtf u expect mama u ripping up the streets in a charger when ur seizure prone and u trolls in comments stop ✋️ cuz this lady was off xanz or out of xans i forget the story.
Did she survive?????? 😢
"Is someone in there?" Asking a question at the wrong time. Quit stalling and hurry up was all I was thinking.
Who's taking the video!!!!
Instead of asking if someone is in there why not jump and try to help every second counts when someone is drowning
This boy is so smart he saw his limitations and was thinking enough to find help .❤❤❤
Good Samaritan? He’s a cop. It’s his job… 🙄
Looks like drivers seat was under water. How did she survive?
This cop wasn't very fast.. Is she in there? Is the car unlocked?  WTF move!!
TF you mean "is somebody in there" what did the boy just say!!
Thank God for that little boy quick thinking getting help as fast as he did. And must get credit the the cop for coming to her rescue🙌😇Give Most High all the praise ❤🙏🙌
Her son saved her, thanks to the cops for quick respond ❤❤❤
I hear a lot about the little boy being a hero which is fine but we don't hear enough about the brave officer and his heroics and cpr to save her life
This why people who have seizures shouldn't have licenses
Thank you for the sacrifices
Never let women drive again
"is somebody in there?" wth man, her kid literally crying for her. He literally asked you to help her mother
Such horrific way to die. So happy she was saved. Great job!
❤😢so touching
Cop and good samaritan. Um. . ITS PART OF HIS JOB TO SERVE AND PROTECT. I should think he took action when called.
Respectful cop ❤
That cop was slow at reacting.
Cop didn’t even try to help
"Good samaritan"??? Ain't this his job?!
The cop is literally asking if theres somebody in there when that boy is literally crying that the mother is in there. That cop would just watch it happen etc. He just went in later, not giving a fck if the person is still alive(he didnt even did it quick like NORMAL GOOD cops would do...
Did she just drive in there
Man is saving her , not a woman...just something for feminist 😂
HAY mí niño del alma,por ti han podido salbarla,este ángel llegó en su auto en el momento justo,abrazos muy Fuertes Mar España
👋👋👌🙏🙏🙏
Praise Jesus! Amen!
They do love they dodge chargers
God Bless our Police Officers🙏Out on the streets every day saving lives regardless of the risk they take of there own lives.There truly are officers that took this oath to Protect and Serve while they go the full distance every day!!!
the part i don't understand is, when the officer arrived with the little boy and says is there anybody in there when he was told by the boy that his mom was having a siezer is crazy.  why did he ask that question?  but all in all, it was a great life saving act.
You're a hero too young Queen!!!! God bless you and your family!!!! Thanks officer!!!!  Bravery often times has nothing to do with a gun.
😳🤔 bravo ma non era meglio senza cellulare in mano?!😅😂😂
That young man is his mom's hero ❤
He saved his mama ❤❤❤❤w l pray my 18 yo son finds Christ and stops this destructive path hes on
World's slowest cop
RESPECT YOUNG MAN.🫡
If a kid say someone sinking why tf is the cop still asking for reassurance?
Thank you for the update.   May GOD  continue to  bless her and her family. ❤
Okay for one thing #1. The first child said she's still in there #2. There's a young lady in the water trying to get her out. #3 the officer should not have to ask just jump in the water and see for yourself that would give the lady more time and more choices for survival. Like he doesn't want to get wet when you put that  uniform on your life doesn't matter only the one that you are to protect like mine in the military my goal was to make sure my brother and sisters got home safe and then I think about myself us military personal are geared different
Cop didn't do shit.
Why did the car fall into the lake?
The kid literally said his mom is stuck in the car. Why did the cop keep yelling "is someone in there?". The could have cost that mother her life
I know you are a kid. But son, you should be able to turn the wheel when you see her going into the pond. 😢
❤
i feel so bad for the little boy, i cant imagine how scary it must have been potentially almost losing your mom. but he saved her life and im so glad shes okay now
Thank God Almighty
Praise The Lord ❤
Bless this little boy.
So much copaganda on this fucking website.
I appreciate 🙏🏾 this officer 💜 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
😮.. . Is somebody in there???  That is a strange question to ask a drowning victim 🤔
Po rzekach się nie jezdzi
I was wondering the police  self camera was working well under the water thanks for the design
The 1st question is, can you answering somebody in the water? Blurp...blup....blup...blup....  🤦🤦🤦
Please keep updating as to her condition 🙏🏼
Is somebody in there?? The kid just told u his momma was in there fuckin christ sake.
That poor child😢
That boy is GOLD!❤
Bendito sea Dios te alabo
Gloria a Dios su mama se salvo
Ion like how the cop going to ask if she in there after the little boy already told him what was going on then proceeded to ask is some one in there as if the woman would say with water filling up her lungs yes I'm in here. I really feel like he wanted her to unlive then act as if he gave it his best try😒🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
That little boy is a blessing to his mother and oh my God thank you for having that officer near❤ I Thank this officer for being a great human in these trying times and may God bless you sir in every endeavor❤
He took his time 😢 if it were “somebody” else he’d run and keep asking is anybody in there after the kid told him she sunk she’s having a seizure ftpolice
god is good❗️
Dis nga said is somebody in there really nga
Oh no ,, attempt rescue 🛟 IMM 🎉
Poor boy 😢😢😢😢😢
God bless that man man !
How much Slower can a cop be ! He just told you in tears soak and wet Barely Breath!!! And your response is … Is somebody in there!?!?!? Really
This cop was next to useless
Dramatic?
Amen
Any other time police show up they use the guns ...why not here ??? Would have opened that window right on up but nope bullets only to off citizens right !!! Smh really pathiec and yes Karen's I'm in the business of rescues so eat something and be quiet.
Porqué grabar si puedes utilizar las 2 manos para salvarla ?
"good samaritan cop" aren't they supposed to help? Do they suddenly become "good samaritans" when they're not beating up people ?
Women should not drive
@bhuphries1360 how did u find the video must of been hard thank god she was ok
That cop was dragging his feet.
Really!?! That terrified, traumatized precious little boy is at the car before the cop....wow. You are quite the little man that saved your mama❤
How the hell did she drive into the water.
How did the boy know it was a seizure? Does she have them regularly? Should she be allowed to drive? She nearly killed both of them.
Yes there are good cops too
Hello? Is anyone in that upside down car under water having a seizer? Hello?
HOW CAN THEY SAY HE DRAMATIC I HATE PEOPLE WHOLE TIME ITS HIS MOTHER SMDH
"Is somebody in there?" Really?
Your are angel to help 💖 💛 💕 ✨️
❤❤❤❤❤❤😢f
American police - best guys!
Great job brave man saving somebodies life. The familys mother you saved they will be praying for you and your families well being rest of there life. ❤
Is she ok??
When i was his age i pulled two kids who fell through a frozen pond while walking on it. Kids today are incredibly weak. How did he run away from his mom to go ask for help. GeT her out
POLICE DOING THEIR JOB!!!   Fund our Police!!!
He’s fired for sure
Heck of a job young man....your courageous actions saved your mom and now you've earned the title of a "real life super hero" 👍 💪💪💪 👌
Strengthen the " they can't swim stereotype "
......is.....anyone ....in...there......urgh ....
......anyone annoyed of the dilly dally ?
Niño excepcional ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
His cries just tore my heart apart. 😭 I truly hope he's doing okay!! ❣️
Tf he take so long for*?
Asking dumb questions
Saved his mom life ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If he was white that police would do did it faster this I can't make this up
What an EXCEPTIONAL CHILD 🙌🏽  He loves his Mama so much no fear was going to stop him from getting help or getting her out himself. Thank the most High for putting this courageous officer in the right place at the right time as well! Y'all 🥹
God is amazing ❤❤ THAT HE still has Great ppl on earth 🌎
That cop didn't save that woman that boy did he really took his time to get in there and save her
Is she in there?😢😢  The child had already said she was
Ce policier ne sert à rien . Une femme ce noie il prend sont temps il film 🤬
Is she in there?😢😢  The child had already said she was
😢
I saw a piece about this from a couple of days ago. I Googled "West Orange TX July 24"  According to the news report, mom was on life support for a few weeks, but recently has been able to breathe on her own. Her family says she's making progress every day. So pray for her and her two kids, please. They have a long road ahead.
That cop sure took his dang time
That poor boy.
This cop needs to get fired.
Good job, little man! You might be small but you are MIGHTY and FIERCE! You saved your Mama’s life and you did such a great job!!!! ❤
Well done officer 😊
What a brave boy and fast acting officers❣️
Poor kid I hope his mom is ok
After this the only one who'll be acknowledged is that cop by the city. It literally happens all the time or a tyrant who dies cuz they wouldn't call off a chase inside a city due to their ego is the only one mourned by the public officials in the meantime you have an innocent family who was also wiped out get no mention. Public officials doing the bare minimum as a human being aren't heroes in my book.
What a great fuckin hustle the cop has. 👎
We should have mechanisms that force open doors or force break windows or force unlock seatbelts in case of emergency
I know a few people will be speaking of genuine emotions, but it's so sad that so many people will pretend to care SOOOO MUCH, because they are black. No way to know, and the people who are like that usually won't admit it to themselves.  That's great that he saved his mom, and I hope that strengthens their bond, but I am reasonable enough to admit that I don't care about this anymore than the roughly 150,000 people who die every day worldwide. If it weren't for this video, nobody would have ever known except for their family, and a few people near them in proximity. I'm not sure why people feel obligated to pretend to care about total strangers, but I suspect it's related to caring about how many likes you can get on your dumb comment, pretending to care about people you don't care about. Everyone should thumbs down this, and/or report it. It's pretty pretend insensitive to people who pretend to care about everything.
God Bless this young man, he is a HERO ❤
Why the cop is so chilled
Great kid.  But surely that's what the police are for? Helping heroically!
Obrigada Senhor por teres mandado os Anjos para salvar quem precisou na hora certa Obrigada Senhor
Heros in all sizes.  Brave lil boy. God bless all three of you ❤
Thank You God😇
Cop is very slow to help
Oh man im so glad they got her out.  That little man was brave.  He did a good thing that day. My father was killed in a flash flood when i was 11. Im almost 40 now. Its traumatized me for years. Worked as a lifeguard for many years to. Thinking it would make up for not getting a chance to save my own family like that.  So i pray this mom makes j It thru. Please update us if anyone b finds out more.
Breaks my heart the way this child cries for his mom
❤❤❤❤
Why did the cop yell out to the sunken car, “is anyone in there”? As if the woman was going to respond. The boy answered for her, “My momma’s in there!” The desperation of his voice and wanting them to help her just broke my heart. That boy is a hero .
Another Covid vaccine victim?
For that little boy to know his mum was having a seizure, she must have had at least one prior. Why drive your car knowing you have uncontrolled seizures and put yourself, your children, other road users and the emergency services at risk. Get a cab/bus and stay safe.
I almost teared hearing the boy cry for help this something straight out a horror movie 😢
Thank God
Perhaps new measures need to be in place for people with this medical condition. Its not safe for them to drive. Poor woman just trying to live a normal life i cant imagine hiw hard this was for them both.
We need self driving cars!!!
🙏💔
Oh goodness so scary!
The question is somebody in there is Just time wasting.
He's a hero God bless ❤
Gators in that water?????????
Si en vez de filmar se preocupan más por el rescate?
Finally, a cop doing their job correctly.  Protecting and serving
Hero child.
Could they move any slower.
I could not imagine being in that child’s shoes in that moment 😨
😢
The little Angel ran to get help for his mother!!
You guys are asking why he’s still questioning the boy. Guys in the time the boy went for help the mother could’ve crawled out. It’s normal to recheck the situation upon arrival. Especially if there’s no need for him to leave the boy. He did his best and saved the lady what more do yall want
Is there somebody in there.. i dont think dude has sense of urgency bone in him..   Its like if i dont gotta get wet i aint goin in.. ferrrekkk!!
Amen thank you Jesus amen amen 🙏🙏🙏❤️
That " is she in there" and " is there someone in there" had me pissed a bit. Kid crying, saying his mom had a seizure and sunk, and he over here asking before jumping in.
Everybody talking about the kid, props go out to him, but the cops also did great. All 3 heroes.
God bless you son
😢❤
Take your time damn
Thank you sir
Son unos héroes en verdad Dios los bendiga siempre y que la sra se recupere .. y tú  niño actuaste inmediatamente eso fue lo que salvo a tu mami la valentía de salir del coche y buscar ayuda para mami
Amen
Poor baby! It’s heartbreaking he had to go through that 😢
Why is the cop asking" if someone  is in there? " The child is telling you his mom.   Is it time for that officer to retire?  What a waste of a human being.  Part of his job is to listen and respond in a fast manner.   I'm sorry  but it's  time for him to retire.
Bravo ❤
I love how even though the cop and the other guy saved her life, people will still say the kid did actually save her because he’s black and the other guys are white which is inadmissible so lets take merits from the white guys and give to the kid because hey why not
The "help her" broke me
Thank you to the angels who walk amongst us.
This cop sounds like he didn't believe the boy nor did he want to get wet. Smh
What make me believe that if the little boy and mom had been white that cop would have gotten in the water much sooner or faster ?
Cower
*All Praises to The Most High for sending the right people to assist in these life saving efforts.*
Shouldn't be driving if you have seizures.  Putting everyone at risk.
Why the usa ppl are so damp , the car is under the water and he asking if there any one and walking slow , gooo help them man
Kid aks for help he stands on side of pond asking if anyone in there after the kid just told you, the person probably not going to answer in unconscious etc, cop wasting time not wanting to get wet..
No shit. That poor baby boy. And that Good man.. he wasn't bedside manner but he was all action. No shit. That good man just got blessing from Australia
That’s why those window breakers advertised by Jared Leisek from Adventures With Purpose are such a great idea.  Could save countless lives.
Don't rush officer casually taking his time
😢heart breaking
That baby was scared & brave at the same time he new had to do something he was great under the pressure he was under he saved his & his mom life great job thank you Jesus
Please tell me his momma survived.   He worked so hard and so maturely.  What an amazing young man
That baby help save his mama
Heroes, son and officer ❤
well done to the boy who got out of the car in time .To run and get help to save his mummy life  ❤🎉
So much
Thank u sir
WATCH THE FULL VIDEO THAR COP WAS SLOW TO DO  ANYTHING YOU WILL SERIOUSLY WANT THE COP FIRED AFTER WATCHING THE FULL THING HE TOOK HIS SLOW TIME
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
😢😢😢🎉 loving strong comment s
That’s the most dodge charger thing I ever seen unfortunately
Stupid cop asking if someone is in there when the son is telling him his Mom is having a seizure. It looks like the cop wanted her to die in the water.
Ay Dios mio...esto me parte el  ❤ 😢
I’m sorry, but if you are prone to having seizures, isn’t it a bit dangerous to drive? I have a friend who is epileptic and she said she stopped driving because of it. I understand if you don’t have help, but it’s kinda dangerous. Glad he was able to save her.
Thank you God for the Officers 🙏
Awwe poor baby❤!! I pray both are ok. Great job officer!!❤
People with seizures shouldn't drive.
Ya'll played a big role to save her.bless y❤
God bless law enforcement ❤❤❤❤❤❤
das die noch zeit haben das aufzunehmen
The reason to get your kids😢
“AHHH MY FOOT”  “Is somebody In there 🤔 ?”
That's what loving people are like❤not haters.
For me personal the cop was to chilled...
Crazy to watch this in a YT “short” format. That’s a whole lifetime, for these good humans… I said gotdamn! May God bless every human!
The boy said, She is having a siezure, she sunk, she in the water".  Yes officer she is in water having a siezure, she can't open up move quicker..
This was surreal!  God Bless Them ALL!❤🙏🏽🙏🏽
Prayers she is ok and happy at home with her son
So what some of y'all heathens saying is it wasn't worthy of the Olympics?
The boy is the one
Por favor, qué policía más incompetente, que sangre mas gorda. Y el niño suplicando y el tan tranquilo. Si no llega a haber otro testigo allí.... Y encima cuelga el video para que veamos que es un héroe.
Some people are definitely missing the racism gene…thank God for that. Thank you ❤❤❤❤
Спасибо всех, кто спас эту женщину❤
I am glad they were there to help
No shyt someone is in there Sherlock Holmes. That boy begging that cop to help her is frustrating. Thank god for the other person who sprung into action like a real hero
Aw😢 love for mummas is so raw. Good baby
JESUS THANK YOU FOR SAVING HER FOR HIM JESUS IN YOUR NAME AMEN
“Is somebody in there” yea no shit why do you think he came for help screaming “she’s in there” 🤦🏼‍♀️
🫶🙏
How tf can u hear sumbody that’s n the water😠😠😠
💔
does anyone know if she made it or not? They got her out yes but she didn't look alive? hope she made it
Bravo monsieur ❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤
Don’t rush…
This is sad in all but i thought boats was supposed to float
Gos bless uou all .i peay she is ok 😅
That boy… the first time I watched this I didn’t understand what he was saying, after rewatching that hit so hard. That hero feeling helpless, that shit hurt
Thank You Jesus ❤❤
Thank You God!! ❤❤❤
Hallelujah!!
❤ Good Samaritan!!
I want to hug that little boy.
This is a great kid, he saved his mother’s life.
Ur all heros Amen
Good cop smhh, beautiful child
His cries to help brought tears! Horrible trauma! I pray she is ok?
Thank God she was saved! ❤❤❤
Good Samaritan or a cop?  U could tell he didn’t want to go in that water
Why not try access via the trunk. Most cars allow that.
God bless you
Now, why didn't a blank when the officer got there? He didn't jump in the water and go straight into it. And so they're going to always anybody in New York? And because number one, if you're knocked out you're not gonna say anything, you're gonna travel for anybody to get out if I was at officer, I would already be in that word about prison, without wasting video taxpayers, money LOL.
Why are licenses given to people who have seizures? It’s not the first time I’ve seen this. DMVs and state governors are fully liable
❤❤❤❤❤❤🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Thank god he was able to find help quickly 😮brave little dude and awesome cop
Poor little guy going through that
They're still some good people left in this world
I pray she made it,he will be forever changed.i hope we get a positive update.
Bless him and his Mom
Poor kid. Good on him and the good samaritan for saving the mom. The cop gets a D- for barely rescuing her in time.  1. How the hell could you just stand around asking dumb questions before casually strolling into the water?  2. Why the hell would you expect the door to open? Even if they were unlocked, the water pressure would likely be too strong to overcome until the pressure equalized. Best thing to do is break a side window Everyone — especially someone who responds to emergencies— should have a glass breaker and seatbelt cutter not just available, but ON them. The fact he didn't bring it with him the first trip into the water is horrifyingly stupid.  I felt the frustration of the kid pleading, "HELP HER" as he stood there wasting precious time. Thank fuck she survived, but this was dangerously close to having a different outcome.
That cop was in no hurry to get in there
Kids need to tlk! tell it all.
To think it could be your baby that saves your life and some of ya'll run to the abortion clinic and have no kids😢THAT baby might be the one to save your life.God doesn't make mistakes😉💛
Sr! What part of “My mom is in there “ scared and crying for help did you not understood😡 JUST JUMP IN THERE AND SAVE HER OMG!! I JUST GOT AN ANXIETY ATTACK WATCHING HIM REACT🤯😵 God save the poor lady 🙏
Such a brave child. He got help and saved his momma hope momma was ok.
Is this dude dumb! he said His mom was in the car u pull up and ask if some one in there the car is flipped up side down in water!🤬
😢
“Come on hop on” legend
How is this family doing after the incident 😢
Am happy she's saved
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙌🏻
😮 my God 😢
That cop sure seemed to be taking his sweet time just casually walking, slowly getting in water going to car, gave me serious anxiety! He told EMS to step it up, I think he was going slow hoping someone else would get the job done! Don’t think he’d checked that car if kid wasn’t there! I’m just telling it like I see it! That’s just the way it looked to me! Thank you for helping protect and serve, you made all the difference in the world to that family that day and hope he’s inspired to  save more lives in the future! God bless and protect them all and give them the strength and wisdom to do His will! 🙏🏻
😢 I hope she made it
God is good!
Back window pops out from inside easiest in most cars for this reason.
Is she in there? Is somebody in there? Every second counts big boy jump in!!!
God 😢you
BLESS THE POLICE & HER SIN! 🙏
What we saw was a son who truly loves his mom enough to seek help.  I'm glad her life was saved by all involved.  Amen ❤
Thank you Jesus. This was heart-wrenching😢💕 And thank you sir!
I hope somebody started a go fund me for these 2!!
I mean can the cop go any slower!!!!!!
THANK GOD FOR THE CHILD THE OFFICER,AND THE EMS FOR HELPING TO SAVE HER LIDE.🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Poor kid that shit will make a grown man break down and cry 😢
That boy is the great American HERO.. bless his little heart!
Histerical kid :"Help my mom shes in the car having a seizure....shes sunk,shes in the car."  Cop: "is she in there? Is somebody in there.?
Praise God for everyone that played a role in saving this mom and God bless her son ❤
O NOW THEY NEED HELP!!! DEFUND THE POLICE THEY SAY LOLOLOLOL LMAO
Bless you dear child. You saved your Momma ❤
Quien puede grabar? Mientras otros se mueren?
Stop! You're blinded by your racism. You all get that from this pieced together clip.  He had the little boy hop into the car. Yelled to the guy that was there. He got a puncher to break the window and was under water trying to get the door open.
That cop was not feeling getting in that water to save a black person. Doctors,nurses, none of them really care for black folks! Talk bad about yall right in front of black co workers
Weird. At first no one else appeared to be there. Maybe that other person was under water.
I wouldn’t have helped him. Someone of his demographic could help him. This is disgusting
Cop was in no hurry. How about you move with some purpose bud. Seconds mean everything
Thank you
Dang WAYCST cops.....
Good man ....that stoppped to help !!
About 8 months ago I had a seizure behind the wheel thankfully it was only a petite seizure and I didn’t wreck my truck I almost did though and that scared the shit out of me i haven’t driven since. my prayers go out to the mom and her son.
What a kid man he stepped up when needs bruh with all that stress too
Great team work!
Ce garçon va devenir policier
Aww thank you honey 😢❤ GOD BLESS THAT BOY OMG
Ordinary men run from danger. Heroes run towards it.
WHAT A STUPID QUESTION THE CAR IN ON LUCK HELLOOOOOOOO MR👎👎👎👎🤮🤮
The cop was in no rush to get in that water lol, the guy and especially her son saved her life cop helped. I'm kidding nice to see people coming together in crisis
The cop didn’t do shit. The kid already said my mom’s in the water, and the cops asking is somebody in there. 😂
Todos los involucrados que rescataron a la Señora muchas gracias ❤❤❤
God bless 🙏🙏🙏
❤❤❤
😢😢😢PO Baby
Break the back window. Hope Momma is safe. Rude officer
God grace to everyone doing their part to save this woman.
Don't rush to help freaking jerk!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ bless all the people involved in saving her
Why is he yelling is somebody in there like they gonna hear or yell back in the water.
That sweet little boy, watching this broke my heart🥲
That sweet baby... He deserves the world after that. Bless his precious heart... I pray momma is okay!
That poor baby!!!  I'm glad they were able to help.
Maybe instrad of holding the camera to show how nig hero you are use noth hands and brain to actually help!! Why everything must be recorded these dats!???
This is the kind of video we should see more of instead of seeing the videos that tear us apart. There are millions more of us who are full of love for one another than the occasional individual who is full of hate that gets passed around by mainstream media who need us to hate one another so they can sell ad space for news programs that make that money off of our suffering.
Worst nightmare as a mother. What a brave young man 😢
That cop needs to get another job..what a pos person
❤❤❤
God bless you young boy ❤
"Tell ems step it up" bro that cop was SO SLOW "alright hop in" "is there anyone in there?" Yes my mom "is there anyone in there?" Wtf
Thank you Jesus
He said shes in there
Shout out to the police that serve and protect
He’s screaming help her and and he’s asking all these questions pissed me off
I can tell you from experience , this is alot scarier than youd  think , when you actually are  in the water , trying to get someone out.   Especially at night.
Seizures ain't no joke man. I remember my mom telling me as they were traveling & she needed rest,  my brother had a seizure some minutes after she woke up & they had just switched over again.   Don't underestimate even a minute worth of time your given to have/make change. As I would always carry with me,   Every Second Counts.⌚
Not a good place to park
That’s traumatic for that kid
That boy broke my heart.... I can't imagine how scared he must have been.
No instincts whatsoever in these cops
Thank you
He said she’s having a seizure 😢thank God the right people where there at the right time 🙏
....which is why i don't  drive.
Thank you Officer & samaritan for saving her! God Bless you!🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
The cop really didn’t start moving still later.
i hate when officers ask stupid questions. the boy said "she having a seizure she sunk" idiot if the car is in the water and what the boy said can happen to people with disorders that have symptoms of seizures it aint rocket science to know she was in the car
Tgank God ❤
Glad. She's  ok
Ppl want to defund the police when they are hero for the ppl with no police alot of ppl will die
No way.
Thank God for this young man, for saving his mom’s life. This is very scary. Thank God for the law enforcement to be there. ❤❤❤❤❤
The little boy's cry for help ReALLy BR⚡KE my 💔!  And. I have this BIG LuMp in my throat! My LoRd I cry about everything! I hope she was OkAy! Thank yoU officers
Why they call the cop a Good Samaritan for doing this. No. This is his job.
The man: Is somebody in there? Young boy: My mom, help her 😢  It broke my heart😢😭
If you actually watch the full bodycam,  the first cop just kept yelling and walked around the car for about 2mins looking around while the child kept saying "My Mom is in there". The SECOND cop sprinted straight to the door, broke the glass and dragged out the drowned mother to begin cpr. The first cop was apparently afraid to get his shirt wet.
Loki cop burnt me up asking is anyone in there, of course it is that person aint out there looking for car insurance.. cop moving slow af, like dam wut if that was his mom.. but glad they got her out❤
Yet enough idiots out there wanna defund these heros because of a few dumbass eggs.
poor baby he was so scared omg
No puedo imaginar la desesperación de este pequeño al sentir que podía perder a su madre, bendito sea Dios la salvaron.🙏🏼
Why is the cop so calm??? They phucking evil man wanting her to just die… asking “is somebody in there?” Why u asking that!?
Angel son. God bless him
I hope she is ok.   Poor baby
GOD bless them 😢
Poor kid
Poor baby 😢
Bless all three of them especially the son❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾
God bless the little boy snd the cops  !
I hope she’s ok? Seems these videos never post updates.
Oh Lord! I hope she recovers!
See folks NOT ALL police officers are uncaring. Keep that in mind.❤
I'm not ruining my shoes or my clothes to save a brown anything 😂😂😂
The cop was actually moving slow . Why would you ask is somebody in there when he’s literally telling you his mom had seizure, crashed the car and you see the car in the water and you see his desperation
Why did it take the guy so long???
God was with them, he sent his Angels to save her.🙏👍💯🥰
All this people being upset with the cop for "taking his time" don't realize there was another man in the water. Thats who the cop was asking, if anyone is in the car.
My son lost his life on his 26th birthday  from a seizure he had in his sleep.  I hope everyone is doing well.
Could he be any fucking slower ?
Thank you for being you and helping ❤️ AMEN THANK you ❤️ 😊 🙏🏻 💖
the desperation in the boys voice tears at my heart.
She made it?
Acompaño padre con mis oraciones
No disrespect and I'm not trying to be mean but how did she fit in the water😅😊
Great job. Wonderful save
🙏🙏🙏
"My mama's in there, help her!!"  "Is somebody in there?" OMGosh.
Thts like water boarding just drowning God help her and bring some miracle
Anybody know how she ended up in a lake 😢😮
None of you big Texans have cables on you, to pull her car out?!
Sure took his sweet ass time, the boy just told you his mother is having a seizure and is in the car. You ask the guy who’s already neck deep in water, if someone is in there. “No, I’m just in the water getting wet for nothing dude” wow!
WHERE COLOR DOSENT MATTER THANK U MISTER🫡👍🏾❤️
UH CAN THE COP MOVE FASTER THAN A SNAIL? WTH. NO URGENCY WHATSOEVER AT ALL. DISGUSTING.
My heart hurts for this family 😢
Just move out of black and brown neighborhoods
Oh, my heart!! I hope this baby was reunited with mom asap. I can't even imagine going through anything like that at his age.
Thank the lord it ended well because of the hero she raised, the officervand EMS. That poor little guy was going to make sure his mom was ok.
God bless that child !  So what happened people Just upload anything and leave an  inconclusive story ???
Gracias a Dios y a los presentes, ese niño NO merecía perderla, NUNCA se está preparado para éso pero a esa edad es devastador…!💔
This shit breaks my heart. Im scared for my daughter drive for this very reason
Underwater for that long she’s dead
Lazy cop asking if someone is in there... you should be jumping into the water right then!!!!
Taking their sweet ass time breaking the glass smfh
She had Michael Scott's gps...😂
“Is somebody in there?” The young man JUST told you she was in there.
OMG!!!! THANK GOD THAT SHE'S OK🙏🙏🙏🙏AND, GOD BLESS HER BRAVE SON❤❤
Jonquetta Winbush is the mother's name, she will make a full recovery according to news reports. Son is 12 year old name Dwight
It's obviously AI...white cops don't help black citizens.
Breaks my heart as a epileptic person
Thank God they helped.  I pray that mom is ok and son knows he did amazing.  God bless them 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
"Is there anyone in there "
The boys said mother had a seizure, the car sunk, and the cop said is anybody in there? Last time I checked, I don't think people could talk underwater
On est vraiment avec lui?
Gay as
❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏
This hit me where it hurts 😢 my little brother you a hero and pray that God would put a shield over yall and bless y’all with peace during this hard event much love to all my brothers and sisters out there and GOD bless every single one of y’all amen 🙏🏾
Your not all bad ❤amen
Cop taking his sweet ass time
This baby is brave! His mom having a seizure is unexpected! I am so proud of him! Any legitimate updates? Also, for the stupid a$$ comments, you can hide behind the comments and your random handles, but Karma for your ignorant comments will catch up with you, you family (if you have any), and your future….dont be surprise because it will come to you when you least expected…it is done! ♦️
Cop reaction time slow asf
God bless that man for risking his life to save that of a stranger. I hope they all went on to lead fulfilling lives.
Now hes a good kid right there! ❤❤❤
Why was that cop so slow.
What a brave loving young man. Hope all is well with the family 🙏
They were not alone the young man was extremely brave. Jesus Christ was in the midst Glory Hallelujah 😂😇❤️🙏🏾
❤🙏🙏
Is therr anybody in therr?? Let me see your hands!! I ain't tell u again!
Cop is way to chill for that situation 😂
Thank you God for this boy to get someone to help save her❤❤😢 THANK YOU ALL GOD BLESS❤
There are some good police officers in the world.
To God be the Glory🙏🙏🙏🙏
That poor baby. Breaks my heart, knowing he had to see this. I pray shes ok.
Ty Jesus they got her out! 💕🙏🏻💕
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤
Thanks
Thank you to that hero boy and this amazing cop both well done hope mumma is ok
Praise God 🙏
Our police and fire fighters deserve our respect.
That cop was not wanting to get in that water
They all saved his mom. It was a group effort.
The cop pissed me off. NO since of urgency
God Bless Thank You. ANGELS. AND Thank  You Lord For Saving His Mom.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👑🙌💪🫵💒🌍😁🇺🇲😇🙏🫶💒☮️🛐✝️💐🌷👏❤️🟥
A real hero wouldn't have stood there and asked questions right after the kid just told him what happened
People screaming help her and he's like is there someone in there is the door locked wow
Blessings to him and his mother
I thought people who have seizures weren't aloud to drive. 😮😮😮😮
He was moving too slow for me I’m sorry that’s life death
🙏!
Officer needs to have a little more hustle!
I've never in my life had a seizure but I've been hit from behind from someone that was. And every once in a while, I worry about it suddenly happening while my kids are in the vehicle with me. I did have some neurological issues growing up. Thank God all has been well 💜🙏🏻🕊️
Omg!!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💪🏾
Great save!! 🫡
GOD BLESS TEXAS!  The child saved the mother by screaming “Help my Mom”. The Texas police/sheriff saved the day🇺🇸💯🙏🙏👍
If no one told you, thank you. I'm telling you you were amazing. God bless you for her
NOBODY BUT GOD' HELD UP THAT CAR UNTIL HELP ARRIVE. HALLELUJAH JESUS' HALLELUJAH  WHAT AN MIGHTY MIGHTY GOD' I / WE SERVE.
Thank for the update may God bless all that help this lady and may God continue to bless her and her brave son ❤❤
Painful to see the poor child asking for help…
Dang it couldn’t have been more clear that there was someone in there. He’s yelling she had a seizure she’s in her help her Help my mama poor baby
Te van a contestar los pescados.
Cop didn't do s%^t. What a joke
😢
Poor lil boy, god bless his soul
He a Lil Prince save his mama life🎉🎉❤❤❤
The man was little skeptical thinking this might be a setup. But all is well
The cop is so dumb - could the kid be any clearer?
Why didnt he just save her why did he run off lol
Seconds are precious and mean everything right now.
The kid is literally crying saying his mom had a seizure, that she sunk and is in the water... Meanwhile this cop wants to take his sweet ass time asking a full questionnaire. Get your ass in there and check! Someones life is literally at stake and he wants to fuck around.
Lord have Mercy 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
RIGHT AND MAYBE THE COP COULDN'T SWIM.
I'm actually really mad. I'm mad at the fact that the cop had to ask three times and EVERY SINGLE TIME HE SAID HIS MOTHER WAS IN THERE.  Honestly, fucking listen the first time.
He doesn't sound like he believes the young boy and takes his time.glad there was a good Samaritan already helping.
It says "good Samaritan", was it his mother?
Good thing it wasn’t Florida.
I’m outraged that the officer had the audacity to casually ask   Is she in there?  Is somebody in there?
It seems like the kid got out of the car and came to find someone to help save his mom. I think the kid was smart and brave for even escaping the car in the first place.
This is the reason why people with seizures should not be driving.
No offense but a cop is not a Good Samaritan. It’s their duty to protect and serve the people.
Thank you so much for the update
😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏
Verdaderos héroes sin capa 🎉🎉🎉❤❤🎉🎉🎉. Gracias 🙏
Thank God for the fast response from the Police and anyone else that came to help bless you all
WRONG THE TRUTH BE TOLD GOD' SPARED HER LIFE. THOUGH THEM.  TO GOD' BE THE GLORY HALLELUJAH JESUS' AMEN PRAISE GOD'
Thank yoi Jesus,  that the water  was not deep,  and she is alive , today
Brave little guy. 🥺
The cop had no sense of urgency
Cop sure rook his Time
In Jesus name make a full recovery 🙏
So sad for a child, his mom is everything he lives for
a woman having a medical emergency and locked in a car under water. the cop was taking his sweet ass time getting to her 🚶
The “help her”  really hit me.  Little man love his momma.  Amen
How heartbreaking ? Bless them all, and thanks for updating everyone..
God' not god
My god the panic he must have felt. What a horrible situation to see your mother seizing while driving, hitting the water, and then being trapped. I’m glad these men took him seriously.
God bless them.
❤❤❤This baby...   Lord thank you for placing this child and officer in the right place. Lord you are good. I pray they are all okay.
Thanks so much for the update on her condition. To God' be the Glory Hallelujah Jesus' 😊
Wat do u means …? Pregunta mas pe deja
Is somebody in there? Tf yes you hear uim screaming mom....and going super slow at that
Usa needs driving schools
Lord it hurts my soul to see this baby in this much distress. But thank you God she's ok.
That was hard to watch…the young child’s desperation was so heart wrenching! 😢 I pray his mom is ok.
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
The child literally told you that someone was in there.
"Get her up there" lol all talk no action. Eyes only 😂😂😂
Thank you
God bless everyone in this video.❤
This is so sad😭😭
God Jehovah bless them all , the young boy, the mom, the one that rescued her. In Jesus Christ name
Great job
😭😭😭
I heard there was a baby in the car too
The boy is crying to help his mom and someone says, is she in there?  How lame. Of course she is if he is so hysterical about it!
God bless this young boy his mom and the police officer who save her life. God take care ofthis young boy and his mother
The kid had more courage than the man assisting GOD bless you young man!!!🙏❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏
Good for the officer. Here’s the thing. Stop with questions. Get your ass in there. Look at the car!! The front is under water!! I can call this out as a former LEO with all due respect. Get your ASS in the water and get her.
Why is he a good Samaritan ... Hes a cop its part of his job
He did t want to get wet for a black woman 😅
Ted Kennedy left a girl in a car like that to die and never paid a price
I just seen this on Inside Edition.
🙏🏻💞
Thank YOU JESUS
Did she make it?
Thank you SWEET JESUS
Oh jesus
That cop took his sweet time asking is she in there? In somebody in there? He knew damm well she was in there just dint wanna get wet.
He sounded so calm.  Stay safe.
The kids said three times the mom is in there help her and then the cop says is somebody in there what in the actual hell??
Thank God for this brave police officer choosing citizen safety over officer safety.
Bless his heart poor kid is a heroe
No urgency from cop what so ever.
Amazing
She was having seizure  thank god for this brave son to run for help..
Kid only caring about his mom.
I love this cop. "Hop in" straight love talk
Is that Liam from Shameless
The cop look so horrible looks like he did not want to help at all
Omg
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Not dramatic but tragic 😢
No child should go through those emotions.😢
No urgency by the cop. Shitty cop
That boy became a man that day.
Omg poor baby 😭 HERO
That’s a real police officer to serve and protect his community a lot police officer now in days they get paid to protect himself saying everything is about police officer safety but this officer, my respect as a human being
What do you mean is the kid is there someone in it took that car up long enough to get in the water I don't believe in that water it took him a long time . He should have been in the water faster broke the window, I would have done all of that maybe cuz I'm from up North. They seem really dumb and stupid down there the public servants. Except when they think someone talks back to them !
Thank  God for all of them for saving her life
How did it finish ? Was she saved ?
Maybe we shouldn't defund the police,  what a stupid idea the democratic had
Ladies next time you say you dont need a man remember this
Good Samaritan?? He took his sweet time..
THANK GOD IN HEAVEN HE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO SAVE HOM SELF & HET HELP❤
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Rear window always rear window
Thank you officers. God bless.
This boy is the real hero here. God bless you son.
I know that kid would’ve dragged his mother out of that car himself if he had the strength,Real men will go above and beyond for their mothers ❤
🙏🏾
Damn near zero pep in that Officer step
Bro this is why epileptic people need to not drive. It is super inconvenient to not drive. It is much more inconvenient to die in front of your children.  Edit- as soon as i commented i realized i sound kinda harsh, im extremely grateful they got there in time. My aunt has siezures and has had them while driving before and my 6 year old cousin had to swerve the car out of traffic and into a ditch so they wouldnt die. I was speaking from personal frustration about the situation and not out of malice.
Jesus Jesus Jesus I Pray She's Alright Dear Lord
This has broke my heart 😭
I Hope The Cops 👮 Did Their Jobs🤦🏽‍♀️ We The United States 🇺🇸 Pay Them For🙏🏽💕
All these negative comments are ridiculous
Aww this is so sad
Thanks God she is okay!!
Sweet baby 😢 broke my heart nothing like a love of a son
When he was saying help her,my heart hurt for him. You can hear his desperation in his shaking voice. God bless his sweet soul.❤
Don't ask.
😢❤
Thank you bhumphries
Amen. Prayers for the mom and her son.
What a Hero. We need to show more of the real heroes instead of highlighting the bad 1/10%
😢😢
I pray she is ok. Everyone involved are hero's, especially this young man. He help save his Mama!
😮 Everyone who lives with someone who suffers from seizures should be taught how to always be on the ready when an episode occurs. She's fortunate the river wasn't deep. Good job by everyone. 👈🏽
Poor baby!
God bless that boy and his mama, the cop, and everyone who helped ❤
How tf does that even happen tho 😂
Take your sweet time why dont you
This is so sad and so scary I feel for that poor boy his cry desperate to save his mommy 😢😢 he said she's having a seizure I know that feeling 😢
I bet that cop moves faster to grab the last donut from the box at the station than he does to save a life.
It doesn't show if they got her b out.
That poor boy.  Doing his best to get his momma help.
I'm sorry the cop kinda piss me off a little with his slow response and his stupid questions.
😢😢😢❤❤😢😢🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Good job officer one of you guys did protect n serve
Glad they are okay but This cop needs to be reevaluated that  kid had to tell him 3 times his mom was in the car and asked him to help and he's still just walking if you cant even jog or run you shouldn't be a first responder of any kind
Not a hero - why did he hesitate and waste time?
That little boy is a hero and who ever helped that lady and little boy thank you
Slowest response time by the cop. Gotta move quickly bro.
Dang mam. Respect to everyone involved.
Sweet baby. Thank you for being so brave. To the officer and the other man. Thank you both. GOD bless you all for your kindness.
That’s so selfish of the mother, knowing she’s epileptic and decides to drive. I’m epileptic and no matter how much I wanna be independent and drive . I’ll never risk my life and others. I’m glad they’re okay , but this could’ve been avoided. 🙄
🥺🙏🏾❤is she alright?
Prayers and more prayers 🙏 ❤ ♥
That cop had no urgency smh
I mean, the little boy is being very clear and letting it be known that his mom had a seizure and she is still in the car so what is this firefighter whoever is doing Lynn says he’s got a punch like it usually to break it but yet is body him guess he’s just click click click click. He’s yanking on the door handle.  I don’t know. Is it just me this didn’t make no sense.
Amen thank you God for her son, and the police officer ❤
You are not suppose to be driving if you have seizures. Unless this was her first time. She will have to find another way to run her errands. Why? Because you can not predict when it happens even on medication and being monitored by a doctor.
Sending you nothing but prayer little bud you and mom
When the first thing he says is somebody in their knowing that there is. Brilliant 👏 👏 👏
Did she survive? 😮😢😢
God Bless them all including her beautiful son for saving her life, I hope they are all rewarded appropriately.🙏🏼🕊️💛🙏🏼💫✝️
Prayers she gets off vent and recovers fully.
This cop is so stupid. The kid is traumatized about what just happened and when the cop shows up he's screaming is someone in there.. he's trash
Fake
Poor kid but smart save his mom but God did it all  amen
The child said she is having a seizure that is what happen!
It seems like it took so. Long to get the rescue,done. Slow motion anxiety I felt for the boy.😢 So sorry for his trauma.
Que bueno que pudieron salvarla . Bendiciones
You’re brave, little man. Your momma is lucky to have a great young man like you.
God is still here don't forget that.
Praise God!!! For Son And The Police Officer ❤
😮OMG THAT POOR BABY ! He’s soooo brave ! A split second nightmare changing his life! Praying for their Futures!
Gracefully blessed
❤❤❤ that was emotional,poor boy, the police sometimes get a bad rep But this officer was amazing ❤❤❤
That's amazing and beautiful Men ❤❤ that's amazing
Is she in there? No shit wtf do you think the people in the water are trying to do?
Brave boy❤ good job hunny. You saved her! ❤
That poor Baby. I hope he and his mother are ok. I really do. I'm glad he was able to find some1 and that they actually listened and helped him.
I wish i knew what happened after.
Ty for cop helped and she is ok
This is the stuff some cops do that doesn't get recognized. Thank you officer. May God bless all involved.
Great job guys! 🙏
This haopens more than you would think. Theres a lot of cars trapped underwater with their drivers.
No way according to the news cops only shoot black people must be fake
Thank you 🙏🏽 Lord Jesus Christ for sending help just in time 🙏🏽👏🏼🙏🏽♥️
The cop asked if someone was in there.. I mean the child surely didn’t drive the car into the lake. And he said MAMA like three times. But either way the cop got to it and saved her. Thank God. 😊❤
Is she in there lol nah lil homie was drivin😂
Thank you
Thank God for all those that helped!!❤
*child runs to cop, crying, out of breath, literally saying "she has sunk" cops goes to the scene, asks "is somebody in there"
Why  he's saying is somebody in there clearly.The boy is saying she's in the car
And this is why people with seizures shouldn’t drive they’re not just putting their own lives at risk they’re putting others
I hate that the office keeps asking if someone is in there from the start the child spoke clearly that his mom had a seizure and was in the water, why on earth did he continue to ask if someone is in there instead of urgently getting in to save her life. Thank God the child didn’t stop saying his mom is in there, even got the attention of another adult who was in the water trying to get into the car to save his mother. God bless the child’s bravery and the by-standard who got her out of the car, I pray she is still alive. That was a long time under water. And to the cop who played dumb, I hope there are consequences for his lack of action to save a life or at the very least an investigation into his past behavior.
😮😮😮
ACAB though!
😢😢😢
TO THE COP THANK YOU FOR HELPING HER, I APPRECIATE IT AND YOU!  MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS YOU MY FRIEND ❤
@abc7NY what crap, youve edited it to make the cop look like a hero but infact if you watch the full video hes almost incompetent with how slow he is to react...shame on you and shame on the cop who clearly did the bare minimum a cop should do, ive seen untrained civilians do alot better job than this guy!
Praying that his mom made it 😢
Boys don’t play about their moms, hope she’s good 🙏🏽
God bless all the people that help save that woman and God bless that little boy he'll be so traumatized by that as well as Mama😢❤❤
Did Mama make it, Praying she gets well
El niño 😢
The kid: help my mom's in the car The cop: is anyone in there? 🤔😞😞😞
That child and that police officer in the right place at the right time...Thank you Jesus
Wow bless his heart
Cop took his sweet a** time!
A republican would cheer her drowning. Mainly because they have no morals. A dem would almost drown themselves saving her.
This is what I do not understand you have seizures why are you driving
oh brother hurry it up. and why did you think for a second youd be able to open that door. “HELP SHES DROWNING IN THE WATER!!!” “IS THERE SOMEONE IN THE CAR???” i might just be a hater though idk. had a long day
Thank God for this baby I pray to God she made it but I'm gonna be honest he kinda pissed me off standing there asking that child questions after he heard someone had crashed and sunk he was supposed to go into protect mode hearing that baby screaming help her just break my heart
Cop should have had more pep in his step imo but good job nonetheless I guess
🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️🎉🎉🎉
God Bless the little boy and Mother 🙏🏾🤍
❤️🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾❤️
😢😢😢
If she was known to have seizures, she shouldn't be driving.  Another failure of the healthcare system.   Seizures, heart attacks, strokes and other medical conditions are supposed to be reported to DMV.  Where liscense is usually temporarily suspended until medical clearance has been confirmed.   Same goes for mental health issues and possession of firearms.  Where 90% of mass shootings had prior knowledge of mental health issues yet not one reported to proper authorities.
The cop hesitated he was using any excuse not to go in. He may have contributed but he was a reluctant help. He is no hero
The frustration watching him question “is she in there?” When seconds could count. He was already briefed by the kid that she’s stuck in a car underwater. Why did he have to go back for a window punch, such arrogance that they presumed the child was lying and hesitation when seconds count.
How she end up in the water ?
Thank you!!!!🙏🏻
Thank you Jesus he saved his momma by getting her some help thank GOD and the cop and others for helping to save her life.❤❤
Thank God for Angels being in the right place at the right time
It toke them that long to break the glass? They pull you out the car for a traffic stop they break it in seconds 😂😂😂
I'm so glad this is a positive video with law enforcement! People always wanna make law enforcement look like scum!! ❤
🙏🏽
Sorry, did the cop even care?
For GOD sake, stop with the negative innuendo.  I give thanks for ALL those including rhe police and the first responders on the scene. GOD bless that officer, may HE reward him for his efforts.❤
I felt so sorry for the little man god bless them all
Officer didn't seem very urgent when he 1st came to the car though
🙏🙏🙏
He is telling that she is in there!!!!!!!!!!   Having a seizure 😠
No fkn shet SOMEBODY IS IN THERE! 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
I'm sorry but that officer stalled too long for me! Sir why are you asking if somebody in there, get yo butt in the dam water  and see! DAMMIT
Omg PLEASEEEE TAKE HER LISCENSE AND CAR BECAUSE THIS IS NOT OKAY IM CRYING RIGHT NOW FOR THE FEAR OF THIS LITTLE GUYS HEART OMGGGG
Poor kid. This must have been terrifying.
Bless that boy & his momma. ♥️♥️♥️ That cry for help gave me chills. Praying she is ok. 🙏🏻🙏🏿🙏🏾🙏🏽🙏🏼🎚️♥️
Yene konjo egzabher yasadgh yitebklih enathn 😢❤
@bhumphries1360 you are awesome for finding out but is there a fund set uo so we can send them money? If she has been in ICU you know they need it and that sweet boy has been waiting by her side the whole time.  Please tellus how to send money!!!
That poor little baby boy, I cannot imagine his emotions
I’ve never seen anybody move so slow
Did She Survive.?  Did the cop not listen to him at first.. asked few times , Is someone in There..  But he Jumped to Action 🫡
Is somebody in there?? What an idiot
Frantic little boy: MY MOMS IN THERE!!!! Hill Billy Cop: is sum buduh in nair?
Horrible experience for a child.
Oh my, what a brave young man! The office moved quickly as well. I'm so happy to hear that everyone is ok..
He stands and asks "Is somebody in there" like, duh, she could be unconscious!!
bruh movin slow af...
NO BODY SAID NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS  MAN NOT ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACIST...❤️🙏🏼
Cop seemed about useless, aside from calling for EMS.
No shit someone’s in there. Why someone that slow a first responder
Blessings to him for making a difference in the world 💙💙💙💙
Human beings are capable of so much good.
That’s great teamwork! My young nephew did the same thing and saved his mom. Went up to a Highway flagged down a car . The people got help and a medical helicopter flew her to a stage four hospital and reconstructed her face and saved her life. She flipped a four wheeler. Be careful on those! We’ve all had close calls!
Bless that baby's heart
Fake news
Who drives into a bed of water what an idiot
Took longer than expected you should have been in the water instead of asking all them questions.. someone already in the water.. DAMN hope she okay
Female drivers 😒
The car is under water 💦 and he got the nerve to ask if somebody is in there, like she can answer underneath the water….. cop could of did a better rescue 🛟
Did she live??????
That boy definitely saved his mama's life
Bless her heart❤🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
I feel for that guy, 😢I hope 🙏everything be ok for both of them 🙏
Asking all them dam questions after the little boy already said she was in there 🙄
I hope they saved her, poor kid! Its sad seeing him like that. Nobody deserves to carry that kind of grief.
Sheriff was taking his sweet ass time. yelling at the car from the bank. Get in the water man!!!!
No urgency from that cop. What a pos
No sense of urgency
This officer suck
Thank you Lord for the brave Son, and Officer . I  Thank the Lord for the compassion and concern of the officer, even though it's his job to protect and save, he truly answered to his calling within his Heart ❤️ I've seen a lot of unconcerned officers, but this Officer, I pray for Blessings and covering for his family and his career 🙏🙏
God I hope she's alright..
Beautiful person sir may GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR LICED INES . In Jesus name 🙏🏾
That sweet boy. Heartbreaking
Bro was so slow the cop didn’t even gaf
Thank you
Plus he asks if she is in there because the son said she is in the water so he has to no the facts he dont no if she is out of the car or in the car but gets the info and helps save her ❤ thanks to her son the guy on scene and the cop ❤
heart breaking 😢
thank you
God step in Right on time great rescue  team❤
Ohh Lord 🙏🤍 help her. He love his mama 🙌
I love the "tell ems to step it up". We're always the ones waiting on the COPS to step it up when we have a bad call
What happened omg how can you just leave a video like this….that poor baby 😢
So slow...
Police officers are truly magnificent ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
People's going back the police over anything it's ridiculous
That boy is a hero and brave as hell ,even though you can hear the terror and desperation in his voice he was determined and able get help to rescue his mom and I’m proud of the little dude
The cop gets no kudos. Because, even with the child telling him she was in the car he was still reluctant to go see for himself. Smh. The kid is wet , the car is partially submerged. Wtf else needs to be said? Now, you check for yourself.
I hope there saved  and ok😮😢❤
Little Hero💙 He had to be so brave to do all that!!! 🙏🙏🙏 for their family💞
🙏🏽🙏🏽
All you complaining about the urgency wouldve been the first ones driving passed the kid not caring about what he was saying. This is in texas where there are plenty alligators thatlo chew your ass up and you always observe the situation and make an informed decision before just going into a situation like that bc if you die then they still die too. 999 out of 1000 wouldnt have even of tried to save the wen amd even less than that wouldve succeeded, so just shut tf up
That cop wasn't trying to get wet..pathetic
This fuckin cop couldn't move ANY slower...
The child clearly said his mom was in the car did they not understand English 😮 unreal.  They wait until the car is sinking SMH whoever these people are unbelievable!!!!!!
There are angels among us.  Thank God.
Thank you for the update. Her Baby proved he is mature an can handle himself well in an emergency.  The officer saved her because of the sons actions...She cannot drive any longer. I pray that they are doing well and also getting counseling for the scary circumstances!
Praise the Lord!!! 🙏🏼🌹🙌
Cop was taking his sweet time when he knew there was already someone in the car. How many people do you need to tell you?
Brave lil boy may God bless his mom
He knows how much time has actually passed plus she was seizing when the car went in the water he probably thought that if she was still in there that she had probably already passed you can see that they had blurred her face . You can hear holler at another officer to tell EMS to step it up is the windows are up and she hasn't been in there very long the car is sealed up enough to keep most of the water out for a while they are that's why they are having to break a window to get her out
May everyone will be okay and well! Thanks for the goodness of the officers 🥰🙏🙇‍♀️👏
Cop was annoying, and his hesitation and doubt could have resulted in the victim's death or brain damage.
😢❤❤❤❤
Dont criticize. Lets see if you ever save a life
"Is someone in there" ... is this guy slow
I can’t even imagine how hard that must have been for her son to have to experience that. Good work lil man you are a real hero. God bless you and your family❤
Seizure did that ? Why the f she driving a 500hp engine? 💀
There my cousins
Cops never used his weapon.
Thank the Lord. I’ve had two seizures, that happened over ten years ago, and the doctors, to this day can’t figure out why. I decided never to drive again and some people think it’s a foolish reason, as people with seizure issues drive. For me, if I caused someone to die be abuse I had a seizure, I would not be able to live with myself.
This was so upsetting but thank God for the people who helped. He was so brave. God bless them and I am so glad they are okay
I know the cop was trying to go by the book or his training. But asking if someone’s in there when her son is crying and pleading that his moms in there means she’s in there
OK he was asking too many unnecessary questions
"Bless this man; there are good people out there."
Beautiful
wow, there's alligators in TX and they like to be in the water... so my respect for going in there and saving her...
What no license and registration
I had a seizure while driving with my 10 yr old son. I drive through a wall into a ditch, luckily not a lake. But when I was coming out of the seizure, I could hear, but still no vision, and that is exactly what my son kept saying to the police. My mom is having a seizure…. Over and over again.
Moron cop: "huh huh haayy, der sum one n der?" No numbnuts, the kid is freaking out and telling you there is for no reason.
"Is someone in there"???!!! He was very clear on the situation.  You're getting wet today, get over it.. shit like that pisses me off. You're wasting precious time being remedial.
How scary 😮
Mis respetos para todos los que alludar on a este niño usu mamá q dios los bendiga
Thank ya'll, God bless.🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
The lady will be fine in the name of Jesus, her son is a hero as well as the people they saved her life,GOD ID GOOD.
I dont understand  why he kept askig is she in there when he explained that to him when he stopped the guy that she was in car under the water I mean just go to the car and help you can ask questions after you get her out,He almost acted as if  he didnt want to get in the water.
That officer was tsking too long
@bhumphries1360 thank you for the update
Awe man that’s awful 😕
My eyes teared up & my heart hurt so much for this boy! The angst in his voice had me choking up! He must have a very close relationship with his mother & his devastation had she not been able to be saved in time would’ve messed with him for the rest of his life.
Feel for the boy😢
What a man he saved that child's mother life. God bless you sir.😢😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Poor baby 😢
I'm just glad that there are still good and brave people in my great state of Texas... Kudos to this young man...
Child crying for his mother to the cop,  Cop at the submerged car: “is somebody in there?”   😑 Btch I’m pretty sure that kid JUST told you his momma was in the car under water
We just had a lady in Atoka, TN pass away after an accident where she ended up in a pond.  Terribly sad.
My God! My God!!
This is why I will forever dislike Caucasians with the passion or people in law enforcement. This baby is literally telling you that his mother is in their drowning and you keep asking him questions and asking is someone in there is in there and you keep asking is someone in there when he just said his mom is in there stupid do your job
Did she make it???
Cop go gators what gators.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
The police officers are amazing also. Didn't ask all of them DUMB questions and went right to it.
Im so very glad that his mom is doing ok.
Blessings to this hero son, his mom and the rescuers for stepping up and assisting this lady in her time of need. God is Amazing and I hope all of them are doing well
think u so much cop!!
Yes I'm one of those people that wondered if this lady survived.Thanks so much for the update.
That police did not wanna get in the water
The America i grew up in 🇺🇸. No one GAF about color and helped others when needed.
Thank God for good people
The cop didn’t save her .. clearly she’s in there potentially drowning and there’s no urgency from him , there’s already another guy there doing the rescue,, the videos title needs to be accurate,,, cops half arse’d attempt to avoid looking like bystander as real hero rescues woman , as son is desperately looking for an emergency services worker to help , but it ain’t happening,,,, I know it’s slightly a long title , but that’s the video !!
Thank you officers and son
Bless them all
Angel 😢❤
Bless you Sir
Cop an idiot
Wow😢.  Ty
Good Samaritan cop? This is his job, a good Samaritan does something without needing to be paid for it. This cop could not have moved any slower from what I'm seeing. She is very lucky if she lives.
😢
I'm glad she's OK, but if she has epilepsy she is not supposed to be driving!
Omg
He didn’t wanna get in that water to save her
Thank you, sir, for bringing this story to a good ending😊 So scary 😢😢😢😢
To all involved 🙏 my prayers are with you!
Cop says ems step it up but is slow af Need better people
If she had history of seizures. She shouldn't have been driving.
Thank you
Thank you Lord for saving her!!🙏🏼
Was she saved.?
lord have mercy.
Poor baby! My went out to this little boy!! Trying to get his mama help
Why is he yelling is someone’s in there like they can answer being underwater
could that cop move any slower 🙄
yet this is the same woman to say defund the police
Supposedly on the new cars, the punch doesn't work because they aren't using the glass that shatters anymore
Thank you god for everyone that saved this lady life
😢😢
U shouldn't be driving if u have epilepsy. Why issue licenses to persons with epilepsy?
😢😅thank God for the little young man 👨
Always carry a belt cutter and a window breaker.
Poor Baby! God Bless him and his family
Praying she is ok. God bless this little boy and his family. In Jesus name Amen❤
The child is literally crying to save her n this 🥷 over here “is there someone in there?” Bro turn in your badge after you get backup 💀
🙏🏽
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"THANK YOU"JESUS GOD " FOR YOUR RESCUE, AND SAVING  THIS PERSON.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
God bless them
God bless them all!
That baby was so brave and strong. I wish I could wrap my arms around him and tell him how wonderful he is. I hope this ended well.
God is so good
Well done for that young man knowing his mom was having a seizure and getting help. It's so important for family and friends of people with seizures to know what their loved one's seizures look like and be able to do what they are able to do to keep their loved one as safe as possible.
God bless there hearts ❤️ poor little guy his Mommy. People should be nicer to the police 🚨 great Job 👍
This breaks my heart   Lil man did what ge can do   God puts us here for what reason we will never know   But we have a purpose to do good until our day comes
How about reacting a little faster...
Of course it's a charger
Hurry up don’t ask just get there!
Thank God the world still has godly people
🙏👍✌️
Bless this child and people that saved her. I pray she makes a complete recovery.
Ohhh, poor thing so sweet him. I hope they were able to save his mom.😢 and God bless the police
🙏🙏🙏
Her poor son was so upset, understandably so.  I'm so glad she was able to be saved.
That little boy is so precious and a hero ran to get help for his mom.  God bless them I pray all is well
Muh mahm aayyyahah😂😂😂
Thank you Jesus he saved his mom quick thinking Amen Good Samaritan
Thank God for Jesus. I didn’t know if she made it or not. Wonderful job by the little boy, the police officer and the man already in the water. All brave.
😢
Thank you GOD! 🙏
Why did he ask so many freaking questions he told you the first time bro
Sir! he said his mom is having a seizure, pointing to the water,  yes she's in there.
Thank Jesus
God bless this good officer 👮 ❤❤
Prayers for the mother and those babies. That had to be traumatic to see their mother stuck in a sinking car. Lord I pray you heal this mother and wrap your arms around her and those babies in Jesus name, Amen 🙏🏽💕
I'M SO GLAD EVERYONE IS DOING E WELL DONE OFFICER GOD BLESS YOU  AMEN ❤ AMEN ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤ God Bless All
why he wastes time asking for if there's someone in the car, YOU ALREADY KNOW!
Took a hot min but idk i be jumping fast if that was me like no questions
The cop 🤦‍♂️ asking silly questions wasting time! Is anybody in there? Duh dufus the kid just told you they need help
Omg! I hope she is ok? It is not safe for her to drive.
0 urgency
Whew 😢
The cop just stood there ,get somebody in there. Poor little dude. I hope his mom made it.
Gator 🐊
I thought he said shes drunk and stopped caring for a bit 💀🤣
This made me drop a tear.
Wow 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
She didn't wanna get her hair wet
Cop is asking too many questions
Prayers
I hope she's okay.
There was no urgency in that cop's voice to say a child is in distress and telling him that his mom was in the car!! Instead, he passively asked, "Is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked?" Come on man!
GOD IS REAL!!!!!  What if no one saw the boy… I am so grateful for humans that help humans♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️.
Thanks again for a great policeman . I love you ❤️
Hope she never is able to get a drivers license or able to drive again
Where’s the urgency in the cop!?😅
About Time the Cops Serve  and Protect.  Well done Guys  ..  Got Suits wet n everything
Wait democrats said cops are racist
I wonder what happened heart attack I hate to assume it's an OD
Poor child. I hope she was ok.
Bro took all day to help them
A black & white feel good moment 🤣
They usually blur the person out if they’re dead…
I am so proud of the cop and the young boy.  Kudos to both of them.  😊
They saved her in Jesus holy name Amen t 🙏🙏
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
She never gets her license back 😂😂
Omg that precious boy 😭, my mom had a seizure on me when I was about his age and it was so terrifying! I had to call 911 i didn’t know how to handle it! He did amazing 🤩 and saved his mamas life! God bless you lil hero
He was a little slow at first
You’re not dying today mama!
Suddenly ALL color lines just don't matter!  Do they?!  No hesitation from these heroes to save a fellow human being in distress!  Kudos to them AND the brave little boy!!  We need more examples of positive humanity stories like this from the mainstream media!!
The kids already said she's sunk she's in the car, and the cop's still asking 🙄?
❤❤❤
God bless in Jesus name ✝️
Glory God he was able to get help 🙏
Oh god bless you very much sorry for child  👏🙏🏽♥️😇
God is so good
That cop was moving with no urgency. SMH. Taking his precious time.
Her son and the police 🚔  ❤❤❤ are heroes  . God has Angel's  looking out for us. God bless her and the police officer
Hurry tf up
Why would u drive knowing you could have a seizure...dangerous for everyone
The fuck you mean 'is shumboddeh in dere?" Shit just triggered me like a mf. Mofo wasn't gon do SHIT. Acting like he aint just hear him and SEE HIM explain the whole situation. The fuck.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Thank you for saving her!❤❤❤❤
God saved his mother's life! Also should have called 911!
Man, a lot of so called first responders are going to have a ride awakening when the ground falls from under them on judgement day. That poor excuse of a cop had no urgency in him. She's literally sinking and he's acting like he's asking if someone is the restroom. Smh.
That cop could not have reacted slower/moved slower while that poor child was screaming for help. Disgusting
I hope she’s ok. So heartbreaking 💔 😢
Shitty cop just taking his time. Where’s the urgency
😢😢😢😢😢
What the hell is the cop doing asking if someone's in there can he not swim wtf is wrong with this guy
Smh. That pos cop had no urgency.
I ain't going in water with a big ass gator in there
Clearly this is a danger to everybody else on the road. Selfish to know you have this condition and put everybody at risk😢
Praises to the Good Samaritan.....Bless you abundantly
Blk boys are born of heroes
So sad, son bless you! Hope she was ok.
Praise white Jesus and super man.
Brave dude
🙏🏾 Salute to the copper 🙏🏾
AMEN AMEN AND AMEN 🙏 🙌 👏 ❤️
Damn it didn’t seem like he was in a hurry to do anything.
Cop moved so slow
slowest moving cop i ever seen on an emergency.
Officer safety
White people were ok here...
Thank you to all involved with saving her. This boy won't grow up without a mom
BLACKS WILL ALWAYS ACT CIVILIZED WHEN THEY NEED HELP BUT WHEN THEY DON'T, THEY TREAT YOU LIKE THE ENEMY
Let me ask you 51 questions before I try to save your mom. WTF?
Thank You Jesus For Saving Both Of Them👐🏽👐🏽
Amen 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
That little man broke my heart trying to safe his mommy. GOD BLESS him...and that Cop said to him hop in with no hesitation to help just saw the state of this boy and he took action I love cops when your in a grave situation they are color  blind. God bless you Officer. And everybody responsible to save this life GODS Angels!!!!❤❤❤❤
As much as ppl always talk shit about cops, there are a lot of good ones as well. Don't give up on the PD. I'm a convicted felon and I have no beef with any like this guy
Where is the damn conclusion? I hate these freaking idiots that publish half a story!
I would have went through the back glass
Poor kid.  So terrifying 😢
This cop is giving non-urgent vibes while the poor child is desperate.  Gut wrenching
The title should acknowledge the son too(biggest hero)   Chikd said what waa happening to his mom ans then cop asks is someone in there?? Wtf!
Right place at the right time! Thank you Jesus for those men! Thank you Jesus!!!🖐🏾
I have epilepsy and was given the green light to drive because it’s been over 6 months without a seizure. I usually wait a year just in case, it makes me less anxious knowing I’ve made it a year vs 6 months. But this is my absolute biggest fear driving with my son. He’s only 12 but I’ve taught him what to do if this ever happens while I’m driving. I’ve been having them since he was born and he just saw me have a seizure for the first time last year. He was next to me in bed one morning and before I have one I have a few seconds to warn someone that it’s going to happen. I live with my dad so as soon as I felt one coming on I yelled get grampa I’m gunna have a seizure. He hauled ass down the hall told my dad, my dad called 911 and my son came back. He held my hand the entire seizure and made sure my head stayed on my pillow. Once I come out of it I’m post ictal, which is between the seizure and returning to normal almost like your memory gets completely wiped and he was just standing next to the bed telling me I was okay over and over. Telling me he loved me and that I was safe. He handled the whole thing better than any adult that’s ever seen me have a seizure. He was so calm. He had called his dad to come and get him because he knew the ambulance was coming. As soon as the emts were in the house he finally got into the car with his dad. He’s my little hero and I couldn’t be more proud of him. Kids are so brave when they know their parents, especially moms, are in trouble and seem to be so calm under pressure. This little boy is amazing for flagging someone down saving his mom life. He is a true hero.
❤thank you so much🙏for help🤗🍀⚘️
God saved her!
God bless him.
JESUS CHRIST IS OUR GOD LORD OF LORDS AMEN AND AMEN HALLELUJAH❤🙏🕊️💯🫡
Same thing happened to me, only I was upside down.  It’s scary 😱 and I can’t even explain!
Didnt seem like the cop was in a hurry to get the lady out. Looked like the samaratin did it
before I jump in the water I really need to know...IS THE CAR UNLOCKED?
*"Is somebody in there?"* ....Nah. He's having a panic attack for no reason. Smh
No sense of urgency whatsoever
My friend's brother passed from something very similar. He had a seizure and his vehicle went into the water. Sadly, the help did arrive until it was too late and he had been underwater for close to 2 hours.
Oakland salute 🔥♠️💯🎯🚀✊🏿✅⭐️
Thank you for God giving this officer strength  to help the lady 🙏🏼 ❤️ ❤
Poor boy sperdy recovery for the mom
She was having a seizure while driving. Oh I feel for her. She lost her license. she almost lost her life. she almost killed her son and hopefully they didn’t give her a ticket.  The police do not take kindly to us epileptics driving at all.  I had to myself. I  with just one seizure every six months. I could not risk it.  No one understands.  We have to work we have to get the kids to schools.  You have to live.  God bless you mom to this son I wish you both well. I pray things work for you ❤❤
The back then they save her was great but I don't understand why the cop had to ask a few times was she in the car when the boy was clearly screaming that she was
Yes she's in there her son  said she's having a seizer. Do your job man help her man.
I have chills. They are heroes. That little boy will do great things in the future ❤
I’m so sorry this happened 😢 I hope the women is okay
OMG!!!👃👃👃👃
O course she's in there, who do you think drove the car, get her out and stop answering question. 😢
@fayemcarthur4609 read the title, Good “Samaritan and cop”.
Cop asking way too many questions in a live or die situation.
I know ppl who have seizures and passed away while driving. Should ppl who have seizures be able to have a driver's license?
🙏❤️
This little boy, became a hero in every mother's eyes 😢
Humans heart for. EACH OTHER
Barely 😢 ! If the sound on the Video can here the child so could he ! Waisting valuable time.😅 Asking all these question go over and assist that child like you would any other child
Gracias 😢
Poor baby..
Seizure is scary when someone is driving and have them
A brave soul. Praise God
Is the car unlocked? I have a punch
Thank God for her son knowing his mama’s health conditions!!! Praying for healing and survival. ✌🏽🙏🏽🫶🏽
I feel like the cop should have been moving faster but that's just me
That cop didn't do shit
I seriously don't understand people who just sit in the car and do nothing to save themselves??
They say whites in TX are race ist
Thank you for your service
Thank god they wasn’t in Florida
Brave baby. He acted right away! Hope they don’t get a trauma ❤
Why is this cop taking his time instead of running to the car and helping
That cop barely did shit the good Samaritan did 95% of the rescue
Wow. Wow
Hurry asswhole
How dumb was this police officer 😱😱😱😱😱😱, the baby is hysterical, pointing and crying saying his mother need help. And this idiot pulls up asking is someone in there what the 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱.
Great job NOT showing wjat happened...
Cop too slow
Thank God for all first responders going above and beyond to help others in their time of need! ❤
Not everyone is a tramp 😮 Jesus
Why tf he asking if someones in there. The boy said his mother is in the car!
Cop asking is anyone in there when the boy already told you his mama's in there seems idiotic
Just watching this young man and how frantic  scared for his mother just ripped my heart out Got I pray she was all right. Didn’t look good damn just seeing him in that matter. Hurts me to the core even choking me up May God bless you, little man  your mother and family
Great team work to get his mom out! The little boy will never forget this accident😢. Glad she survived.
In an emergency it always feels like everything goes slow watching this made me feel like this
This is why we need responsible adults around, our world is becoming selfish daily.
Slow ass cop had no urgency  WTF!!!!
I’m glad she’s okay but how the hell….?
Her son saved her life. God bless him
"is anyone in there?" THE JID LITERALLY SAID HIS MOM WAS IN THERE BRUH
Good bless EVERYONE ❤❤❤
Cops are amazing
So brave all of em❤❤
Thank God for her safety. This poor baby cries made me sad. I felt his pain.
Thank God she’s alive, that poor boys cries broke my heart
JESUS!!!!!!
Big ups to law enforcement ❤ pray she be alright Young fella you're a Hero
That cop was too nonchalant.
❤
You can hear her when he walks up & asks twice, is someone in here?
“Is she in there? Is somebody in there?” After being told multiple times by people begging you for help, then he moved with no urgency. Come on.
For  GOD is real
Thank God someone helped her
They Always Say God Put A Angel Where They Need To Be And That Cop Is Her Angel And Hero And Her Son Is Her Blessing God Bless You All 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️💞🙏🙏🙏
😢
That boys cry for his mom
Jesus Jesus Jesus….
I just don’t see the right amount of urgency from this cop. Probably a good man but I can’t support or congratulate him. That boys cry’s get me so jacked up I’d be in that water like a fish.
Thanks for the update. Special  thanks  to those who helped this family in their time if need.
❤❤speechless
I wanna hug that sweet boy 🥰 Bless his heart to react so quick ❤️
❤👍💝
The poor boy 😢
This heart wrenching 💔  hopefully she and her son make a full recovery
I sure hope that they're both OK. He was SO awesome getting help!
People with  that condition should not have a license to drive. WTF is going on with our laws.
How is the police asking a person sunk in the water is anyone there or is the door unlocked. Jump in,  call for help, do something!
BLESSINGS Babe
O M G!!!  MY mama!!!🤢
I don't give the cop too much of the credit! That semaratin did the real diving and her son is her true rescuer and Savior! May they all be blessed!
Thank you kind sir for the rescue 🎉
That lil face , breathing and desperation made me lose it !!! All he could do was summon help ....and be brave !! What a trooper !!
Praying for her and son also the other two men that help out
Poor baby, I hope his mom is ok.
Thank you God and I pray she wont have any side effects from this in the mighty name of Jesus.
That boys desperate pleas brought me right to tears!!! HUG YOUR BABIES MAMAS!!
😢
Actually the CHILD was the HERO❤❤
The guy asking if somebodys in the car. Wouldve thought the kid freaking out gave it away. Glad dude was rhere and willing to help though!
wow that little boy crawled out of that car and ran for help for his momma <3 saved her.
Is somebody in there? Don’t you get paid 100k a year to check?
waoooo este 👮‍♀️ es un heroe y ese niño k valiente🙏🙏
This guy slow af
I felt so badly for her little boy. Brave little boy.
Dumb cop ... next time stfu and hustle! With that said he did help the civilian a little with the rescue.
This cop is so much crap
That poor boy omg
The way  white women and black folks hate on white men, I can see him not wanting to help but he put all that shit aside and did the right thing.
I just looked up the story. It wasn’t just the boy in the car. He had a 16-year-old cousin in the car too. His mom survived, but she was unconscious and unresponsive when they pulled her out they gave her CPR and she was placed on a ventilator for numerous weeks. I believe they have weened her off the ventilator or are or weaning her off.. she is expected to survive and is getting stronger every day. What an amazing little boy she has raised. Any longer under that water and his mom would not have survived. He is literally the reason she’s breathing and vice versa. Kind of cool things come full circle like that. You’re gonna do great things kid!
That's part of their job u know and the fire department
Did they get her out
❤️ me some Texans!
That cop didn’t seem interested in the least, I almost jumped from my chair when the kid started going off, how did the cop not feel any urgency
It breaks my heart seeing his desperate help
Omg ZERO RUSH to help this woman who CLEARLY needed FAST HELP! This WNTIRE VIDEO just hooked my heart! The kid(s)!!! The woman's arm was jello...i cant.....😭😭😭😭💔💔💔 bless this family for what they went through 🙏🙏
Bless that baby😭
The kid is telling you she’s inside why you asking
Bless all of you who helped, embodied and not embodied.
IF YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOUR A PATHETIC USELESS HUMAN, REMEMBER THIS COP TOOK HIS TIME TO SHOUT AT A VICTIM THAT WAS UNDER WATER… and WAITED FOR A RESPONSE MULTIPLE TIMES 😑
If the child got out why couldn’t they get HER out?
Odio éstos vídeos dónde no graban o comentan el final
The simple fact that the police officer gets to the scene and then he continuously to yells twice is someone in there. You just got told buy a child that someone is having a seizure that is just stupid to do.I believe If it was a different police officer, they wouldn't be standing there shouting twice, is someone in there. Of course someone's in there. Do you really think that they can speak to you? When they're having a seizure, and they're suffocating
Oh man I hope she is okay and heals 🙏
Back windows are made to break (be kicked outward) easily for just this occurrence
“Is somebody in there…person drowning help….is somebody in there”…jump in my guy help🤦🏻‍♂️
God bless you
Thank God for everyone that was there
Why isn’t this HEADLINE NEWS??? BLUE LIVES MATTER
Thanku god an young man I love you little man omg
He toookkkk soooo longggg, it’s amazing she was resuscitated
Kid almost had a superhero saga about to start
Don't drive with epilepsy. That kid knew exactly what was up..that let's me know this is a common occurrence. My mom had to drive my neighbor around when I was a kid for this exact reason, neighbor had a seizure with her 2 little girls in the car and they had to tag team the pedals and steering wheel to avoid death.
What a brave boy. My heart breaks for him
Heros all.
That boy is an angel!!! ❤
🙏💜❤️🙏🙏🦅
How terrifying! I hope Mama is okay.
He decided to take off the camera to record him trying to open the door... was that suppose to be his proof if she didn't survive? Because he didn't want to SAVE her. FOR REAL how many times you gon check the door? Don't yall like breaking windows that don't belong to you! How can you be in that career and not hv the BALLS to save a life... I'm just saying
The way the cop asked were the doors unlocked was unsettling ngl
That boy should have said that there's a white woman submerged in that pond. That cop would have moved faster, guaranteed 100%.
Amazing! Brought Tears to My Eyes,Blessings over This Boy and His Mother .
Praise God!!!
More like she’s having a cocktail😂
Cop acting like he ain’t wanna help what lol bra gotta lie for he soaking wet panicking eyes wide as hell
Is the car unlocked...
Great Brave Boy, be blessed, of course the helpful man too..
Thank god they were able to help her get out.
Kid is crying , asking for Help . Cop : " Is Somebody in There ? " Lack of Urgency is Lost with Some People . Minutes , Seconds can be the Difference between Life or Death .
Is someone in there??? Really bro??
I woulda jumped 10 times
Take your time officer, shes only drowning. 🙄
Thank you !!!!!!!! Jesus
bless his heart ! prayers
I pray 🙏 that they are both okay ❤🙏
Thank you ❤.
Stupid amateur cop , he really dont know how to react and what to do when its a life saving situation
Some cops don't need to be cops
We're are these videos when we help each other.... Seems media loves to spread hate!
😢😢😢God is awesome! Thank the baby going to the officer to help. Thank you sir.
He’s asking the person helping is someone in there - STILL - hello- everyone that is commenting the officer is hesitant to help us under the brainwashing of the MSM AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY- CONGRATULATIONS U DONT SEE WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING IN YOU INVENT RACISM IN YOUR HEAD! He says hop in- they go to help - and he asks the other is anyone in there - the kid is distressed- UNDERSTANDABLY BUT SOON AS HE SAYS YES- he runs in and tells EMS- emergency medical systems to STEP IT UP ! damn i mean why don’t u call out any brown skinned person that films people getting the crap beat out them , or in a fatal situation and say damn that person is racist against whites sitting there filming instead of helping? How many videos do we see of ALL COLOR PEOPLE IDLE BY AND DONT Help! Everything is racist to you because u have been brainwashed by this government to Hate and see hate everywhere so that WE THE PEOPLE ARE DIVIDED - wake up!
Good guy helping!
Thank God she was saved
What an idiot 👮 “Is somebody in there?” Seriously? Thankfully there was a Good Samaritan on the scene actually trying to get in the car. This young man is a hero and so are the other two although the officer was a little delayed
God is good🥹♥️♥️♥️✝️
Oh thank God! Thank you Lord! Thank You Jesus!
Praying they both fully recover. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
How annoying was that cop….thank god for the other man.
"Is somebody in there?" What the hell? They don't ask this many questions after they shoot somebody, so why this many before taking action to save somebody?
Lord, I pray you keep us all safe from harms way but if there ever should be a day that you need one of us to respond, I pray you give us the strength, calmness and wisdom to make that save and bring everyone home safely and whole. Amen.
Ive been trying to speak up, and find someone to get the idea out tgete, that mfg of cars should be required to install seatbelt cutters and window hamners in the glove box of all cars, to save lives. These are inexoensive tools, to save lives.
“Is somebody in there?” . . . huh??????  Help them !!!!!
Looks like the the guy that’s holding her deserves the credit here in taking the woman out of the car , that cop seemed like  1. He didn’t want to get wet  Or 2. Scared of what could be in water  All he did after he got in water  Was trying to open the passenger back door.  Like that’s probably been the first thing checked.
Good son, say his mom good for you kid❤
Now what you all think of COPS? you like them you get help.
Wow this is amazing . It was not her time . Thank God her son was there and for this police officer and all that took part in rescuing this woman.
Irresponsible to post this, leaving everyone guessing.
Talk about taking your time, you ain’t tryna save nobody 🙈
My Lord...Thank God for sending this man to her. Bless them all.
Héroes desconocidos!🇵🇷🙏👏
Cop did not wanr to help really
LEGEND ❤
This kind of thing needs to be on the news more often, but good job everyone involved! ❤
Brave, heroic boy! Mom gave birth to her own hero!  ❤
Good person ❤❤❤
That's so scary, I hope she's ok.🙏🏼 I'm Epileptic  and i don't want to ever drive, The thought scares me..
🇧🇷❤️❤️❤️
ACaB amirite?!?
Abba Yah save his mother 🤲🏿🙏🏾
He saved his mom life
Smfh is somebody in there like he didn’t just tell you his mother in there 😟
I hate when they put these videos up without an outcome 🤬
Rauw Alejandro music at 2:26:07
She was driving under the influence and driving erratically.
Man this is enough to bring a grown man to tears... I'm a mama's boy... id do anything for her... I can't imagine being in this boys shoes...
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dodge charger, who woulda guessed?
🙏🏾🙏🏾
She didn't make it, cop eas too stupid and slow, asking too many questions and not using his brain
Young man. you're an angel for sure ..Without you being there she wouldn't have made it.
Average dodge driver.          I know sum bad is happening to her, chill bru, im talking about how the car is crashed, dodge drivers can’t drive.
A White cop to the rescue, well that's inconvenient.
Oh poor baby! Thank you Lord!
Amen! God was there inthat little boy saving his Mom! So gladshe made it! Nothing like a boys love for his Mom!❤❤❤❤❤
Who is videotaping this while this emergency is going on why aren’t they helping?
Still wanna defund the police?
😢❤
Unbelievable that it’s more important to film than save the life
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🫡🫡🫡
What a brave young man thank you for alerting for Help
My god officer. Don’t hurry or even act surprised. Kids crying and he’s like well we have to find out the facts first. Is someone in the car. Did I turn off the coffee maker. Is someone drowning. Should I get a dozen donuts after this.
What a good kid!! ❤
Oh my heart watching this.....wow! 😮😢😭 what a brave boy! That officer was at the right place at the right time!
I pray his mom is okay. I will be looking in the comments to se if anyone knows
Ok so the doors to a car will not open hen submerged in the water like that… so bust the windows , or go through which ever window is down. 😢
We see so much now that we have videos. Much more to pray about. God give us more heroes.
Where's the racism????
Glad he was taught what to do in time of need 😮
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢   That’s so sad I hope y’all make a way through this we all are with you all the way through
True love from a son, ain’t nothing like it. Bless his little boy‘s heart makes me cry watching this video. Bless this little boy heart and for the rest of his life nothing but good things. Watching him reminds me of my sons.
Where is he?
I love you in Jesus name, officer
My whole family keeps one of those window punches on their keychains just because of this fear. Those little things will absolutely save your life. You can get them for a little bit of nothing, I highly recommend getting them for your family..
The more I watch it , the more that cop makes me mad !! .. they got her out but didn't seem he was trying very hard .
He was pleading for help. Where was the guys urgency? Lack of response. Only took him 11 business days from when he arrived on scene to ask if anyone’s in there to when he was in the water trying to break the window open
“Is anybody in there?” What the heck did he head the kid say?  The poor child was crying and begging for his mother to be saved yet, as a cop, he took his sweet time asking stupid questions before getting in there. God bless to two guys who was already in the water trying to get the mother out. Hopefully, she made a full recovery. And her son is doing well from the trauma.
That poor baby 😢
The cop has the survival instincts of a plate of tyson chicken nuggets
That officer was like in no fukkin hurry dude have some fuggin urgency not all of us want u defunded even though ure to much not in control of ure self
Damn this one got me choked up
Bless them
Why ask if somebody is in there?? He frantically told u already
Its a v6 people.. we're good...
“Is somebody in there?” Bruh
Was she okay?
Thank God to ALL thst was involved to save his Mother
Amazing child  and police officer and EMT  thanks to all of you  for your life saving rescue ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤!!!and a great thanks to the gentleman already  in the water  helping  save her life!!! Everyone one is a hero!!! THANKS to everyone and also paramedics and everyone at the hospital!! GOD  IS  REAL AMEN AND AMEN 🙏 🙌 👏 ❤️ ✨️ ❤
Officer moved way too slow for me
Maybe they don't show enough of these cop situations😮
My God!!!
The boy already told you she was in there.🙄
💪🏾👍🏽🙏🏾
Oh thank God. The little man and officer are Heroes❤❤
East Texas cop, they know what, and what not to respond to quickly. You see the son, he had already identified the mother.      I hate to sound like this.
Not only did that child alert the officers but he also gave them an answer as to why and how his momma ended up in the lake/ pond, whatever they call that body of water. Knowing what happened surely helped the EMTs to speed up their treatment for seizures. Bless that child for knowing how to respond, the officers for believing, and everyone involved in saving the boy's mother! Fantastic work on everyone involved in this rescue mission!!!! I surely hope she makes a full recovery meaning no brain issues due to lack of oxygen!
Useless cop couldn’t move faster ?
Dude the cops reaction time is so infuriating
The kid already told him his mother was in the car having a seizure in those type of situations u don't ask if someone is in there let alone walk up asking questions to a person who's having a seizure and possibly drowning to death after u where clearly told by the little boy that his mother's in there drowning and having a seizure SMH. Luckily he finally got to her
thank god this angel was here for this boy and and this family - as you can see there is noone around. God places angels where and when we need them but we dont see them bcz they look like me and you.
Oh, so in certain cases they’re not all bastards? Got it.
Fuck yea! Now this is protecting and serving! 🎉❤
How bless this boy!!!! And all the Good Samaritans
Yeah this cop took his sweet time doing ANYTHING!! The kid is crying his mom's in the car and he stands at the shore and yells out "anyone there?" This is why I don't like cops !!
Sweet baby 😢
OMG!! COULD THE COP BE ANY SLOWER THAN THAT? DAMN!!
Thank you for rescuing this woman and saving her life! Nice job to her son for getting help quickly! 💝
My heart breaks for you sweetie.  My daughter died 6 years ago from having a seizure in the pool. The fear is so real
Poor kid! Cop took his time smh
Maybe this new generation is gonna be ok. That little boy was so brave and courageous. He got out of the car because he knew that he wouldn't be able to save his mom himself, then he got the exact help that he needed to save her. You can tell that she is raising him to be a hero himself.
Thank you Sir for serving and protecting!
Jesus Christ is Lord and he loves you all soo much! The Lord is coming soon! Tomorrow is not promised! There IS A point where it's too late! Get saved before it's too late! He came to free you from addictions, torment from demons, the fear of death, the bondage of sin, ON YOUR VERY LIFE, FOR YOUR VERY LIFE AND SOUL! HE DIED ON THE CROSS AND ROSE FOR US! HE CAN FREE YOU! God hates the sin, yet he loves the sinner, You! Don't let this choice of dismissing him end up being the eternal choice of YOUR FUTURE, YOUR STORY, YOUR ETERNITY, OUR Lord loves you! Get under his covering before the storm hits! So that when he returns you will see your Lord, Saviour, and Friend! Instead of seeing a foe like satan and his hordes of demons will! For their time at that moment will be up! They are already condemned, do not be among them and their followers!  John 3:16‭-‬18 KJV For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  Romans 10:9‭-‬11 KJV That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  John 14:6 KJV Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Ephesians 2:8‭-‬9 KJV For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Romans 10:17 KJV So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  1 Peter 3:21 NLT And that water is a picture of baptism, which now saves you, not by removing dirt from your body, but as a response to God from a clean conscience. It is effective because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Mark 1:15 KJV And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.  Romans 3:23 KJV For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  Mark 16:15‭-‬20 KJV And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.   He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.   And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;   They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.  So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.  Romans 3:29 KJV Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:  2 Peter 3:8‭-‬9 KJV But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  Matthew 24:1‭-‬39 KJV And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.  And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.  And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.   For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.   And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.   For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.   All these are the beginning of sorrows.   Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.   And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.   And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.   And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.   But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.   And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.   When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)   Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:   Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:   Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.   And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!   But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:   For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.   And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.   Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.   For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.   Behold, I have told you before.   Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.   For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.   For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.   Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:   And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.   And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.   Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:   So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.   Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.   Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.   But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.   But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.   For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,   And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  Matthew 6:9‭-‬15 KJV After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.   Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.   And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.   For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.   (How to receive the gift of The Holy Spirit) Acts 2:38 KJV Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.   Feel free to copy this message and send it to others, Jesus Christ is coming soon! To him be all The Honor, The Glory, and The Praise unto The King of Kings and The Lord of Lords! God Bless you!
Praise Yah they were able to rescue her...halleluYah!
Heard the update in a comment. Thank God she’s gonna be ok!!! Great job to the young man and the Officer 👍❤️😎
Cop seems to have not done much.
Bless this family.
Bless your heart baby.
My mom's in there. Is anyone in the car? Kid obviously got out of the car. Is the car unlocked? Where tf was the adrenaline bud?
I hope she made it....poor child has to see something like that... if she's revived someone needs to find out for SURE how she ended up in that water ... i hope it was an accident and not a suicide attempt for her and to take her child with her
🙏🏾🙏🏾
BRAVE BOY HELPED HIS MOM- AND THANK GOD THE POLICE HELPED TOO !!!!!
Thank you for the update. Thank God
The most scarily relaxed cop in the midst of a very desperate situation. Scary stuff.
It giving single mom
Poor baby is so scared. Thank God that officer was there. 🙏🏾❤
OMG!!! Thank you for telling us she and her son are recovering!! I was beside my self wondering what happened!!! Thank you!!
Praise GOD
Man the cop is stupid . kid said go help her and you're asking if somebody in their f****** do your job
Could that cop go any fuckin slower? Where's the sense on urgency? Like yes, you still helped but damn
My soul left me!!!!. My heart was breaking for her and son😢. Omg. Thank God she's okay.
Awe 😢
The police officer is moving like a damn sloth🤦 He got her out but he took his sweet time. She could have drowned or her injuries could have been less if he would have rushed😲
Poor Liam
God bless them
This cop is garbage
Little man saved his momma!!!
Did he really say " is anybody in there" 😮
Thank You Lord the mom & son are ok! And thank You for putting the officers there to help them! 🙏🏾💛 Amen!
That cop was in no rush to help 💔
This world is full of great people ....we thank God🙏🙏🙏
Thank the Lord you guys came along to help this child and his momma!
That poor child had to keep so calm to clearly communicate his mom had a seizure and sunk the car! Thank goodness people were helping!
Damn officer taking ya sweet ass time.
😢 amazing policeman is amazing policeman put number one placement of the Year saving someone's life the world could be a beautiful place God bless him
Yeah, and the cop's a d*** for nonchalantly walking over there.
Good Cops are a Needle in a Haystack these days.   Excellent Work!!! 😎👍💖
If that was his mother he would not be asking if its unlocked and walking slow, " HE WOULD HAVE TOOK OFF RUNNING AND JUMPED RIGHT IN THAT WATER AND RIPPED THE DOOR OFF
What a brave child amen
A little hero, loves his Mother
That poor boy. I’m 59 and my eyes are full of tears for this boy.
God bless the boy and the Po-po.  Both are American heroes.
😢😢😢❤❤❤
❤❤❤
Yah thank you for using this.kind man to save this woman and bring comfort to her son.
Tell EMS to step it up how about you step it up You're walking
public servant helping out
GOD BLESS the officer who rescued the women🙏🏽❤️
i'm pretty sure that policeman did absolutely nothing to save that womans life. Was he 80 years old?
Thank G'D good work little man great work officer and rescue crew!
Lil fellow touched my heart to see how desperate he was for those amazing "White Men "  and I emphasized white men. Thank you gentleman. There are still today great Caucasian Cops.
The cop did nothing but pull the handle of a sunken car🙄 which obviously was t gonna open due to the water pressure. How tf do they train these cops?
Worst reaction and response ever from a cop Holly fuckz work slower much?😊
What ta fack
Remaining calm saves lives… so many negative comments but over all, great job to the officers as well as the family that were involved.
Nice save
Heavenly Father
I hope she's okay
Irgendwie war der typ mir viel zu langsam
That cop sure took his time.
Everyone is a hero in this story. We never know how we would react in an emergency but all of them saved her life even the daughter. I'm sure she was calling on God.
Is the car unlocked ? Is it 4 wheel   drive? Moonroof or sunroof?
I don't think he wanted to get into that water.
It takes months for lungs to dry out when they fill with water. The inside of human lungs are very delicate, kind of like tissue paper. Of course, infection and pneumonia are a big concern, especially when someone breathed pond water. This woman thankfully survived, according to the  comments.      I knew a guy who was knocked unconscious when his boat was hit by another boat at high speed. He was underwater for at least 8 minutes. Somehow he survived, but his lungs took several months until they were back to normal. There was no detectable brain damage. One in a million people survive that long underwater, but he made a full recovery. That's ridiculously rare.
Thank you officer for your help and getting some people there to complete the job   We appreciate all you do for service to the public. 😇 What a brave young man. I know he must have been experiencing a lot of fear but he pushed through to get help. ❤️
He only helped because he seen others doing his job
im guessing not her first one she shouldn't drive lucky she didn't kill someone
That boy and mother need prayers for the trauma this caused. I think the cop was trying to stay calm by saying things we think was unnecessary. Like he wanted to hear someone, so he knew she was alive without asking that.
I hope they were able to save her in time! Did she survive? 😮
DONT THEY KNOW ITS MOT. A BOAT
🙏💔❤️😮😮
Instinct takes over in an emergency, and recognizes that you and the stranger are in fact 1... And by saving the one, you're actually saving yourself. Good job good Samaritan.
Just hearing this child voice made me drop a 😢😢😢
Is she in there? Is somebody in there?  Yea no shit, he is screaming and crying for you to help his mom, and theres a goddamn car underwater. You think someone's faking a car crash into a lake? Christ.
And everyone talks bad about the cops
I'm not fond of the fact the officer seemed real hesitant to get in the water but I also don't know what they have in the water there.   The fact he did act, and her son did an otherworldy amazing job of escaping and requisitioning help, and there was a very brave good samaritan on hand is the series of miracles needed to save this woman. Someone hug that kid.
Good Work, Son! Extremely Good Work, by the Policeman!!! He's a Good Argument, for the agencies. See to it, that this conduct is Rewarded, Handsomely.  The woman's family should thank him, as directly as they can manage.  He's a Fine Example of, Public Service.
Thank God all well and end well!  God bless!!
God's Got His angels everywhere
What the hell was the cop waiting on? All the questions? The guy had the same amount of information the guy in the water had to start with... seizure, woman drowning in water... now GO!
Why was he hesitant at first?😮
" is there somebody in there?" 🙄 REALLY!?
I am outraged at some of the horrific comments . What is wrong with your humanity?  PLEASE, DON'T YOU DARE CALL YOURSELF ChRISTIAN!!!!
This was obviously in the deep south where all hillbilly cops do is give traffic tickets not a Good Samaritan...?It he really hesitated to get in that water the kid already said she was in the car. I wouldn't call this cop a hero but someone who did his job eventually
Put the phone down and save this woman !!
Why ask is somebody in there to a submerged car? I'm glad she was ok.
He didn’t do shit. The boy did more by going for help.
10 mins later . .. " we better step things up ... " Trows donut .
😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
T.k. for telling us 😢
Weird that racists would save a black woman from a sinking car. This confounds the microscopic brain which hides within my blue haired head.
cops more interested in taking a video on his phone
WHAT A IDIOT OF COURSE THERE’S SOMEONE IN THERE
You have crocs in those waters. I think that's why the cop was hesitant.
BOTH  officers and young boy are heros. EVERYONE ONLY THANKING THE BOY. come on now.
🙏🥹
I experienced this once with my 2yo son in the backseat and thank God 3 Samaritans jumped into action to help me save my son once I was awake
HEROES!  So happy everything turned out OK!   🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿 ❤
Just curious if they were having to use a punch how did the brave little boy get out?
That cop sucks.
Lil dude got up outta there
God bless him
How do you even end up there without someone putting you there 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Bless him❤❤❤
The cop moved so slowly it crazy
This chip was slow af. Thank God for the civilian. But did she actually survive???
Assist the situation my "beep!" I would have dive at the first, "help my mom is in there"  Situation takes 2 second to analyze .. do t have to ask if anyone is anyone in there. And let me think, are the doors unlock or not? What a delay for him to decide to help and get his suit wet!  No risk there but getting wet, u can determine that in 2 secs!!
This is so traumatic for this poor kid and the cop taking his smooth time 😢
Get that kid a metal from the Governor! He saved his mom!
"Is the car unlocked?!?" I don't know, the car is I in the water!
Poor kid
I hope she's well and the boy with that traumatic moment. 🙌
That cop is slow  he acts like he didnt want to save heor getbwet i would have  reacted alot faster  the kid told u 4 times his mom was in the car put it together  dumb ass and take  charge do your job man .
❤❤❤❤
GOD BLESS the family and this officer for his duties
👍👍👍👍👍😇💙🧡💛🤎💜🩷💚❤
My heart breaks for this young man. I hope he gets the support he needs after such a horrible traumatic experience 😢. Wish mom a speedy recovery too.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
May God bless them all Amen
This trauma is gonna be with him for a long time unless he get help, i know what its like to hv traumatic experience 😢
These are the same cops that people would hate on. They want to say they aren’t but they are. Not all the cops I’ve worked with were good but I only know 2 who wouldn’t have acted quickly acted and for sure tried to save this lady like these did. I’ll never say there aren’t bad cops but mister would do this.
😂😂
She crashed into the pound because she has seizure.
Sir thank you. God Bless you . Your not  racist thank God.🙏🙏🏽🙏🙏🏽❤❤❤❤😭😭😭
Take your time bud
Will somebody please explain the difference of why it takes so long to break a window when  a rescue is needed, but a thief can bust a window in a millisecond. What is the difference here?
That cop wanted her to die, let's be honest, If you respond this slow, give me someone that wants to help faster!
Ok for you slow ones.. the Good Samaritan was already there attempting to help.. the cop was assessing the situation by asking the questions but most importantly it’s a chopped up video.. he ran to get a punch it looks like and went in to help.. the lady is alive thanks to her Child the Good Samaritan AND the Cop. Easy to quarterback from this side of the situation is all I am saying
defund the police huh?
I'm so glad he was able to get out and get help and he came across someone that helped him😢
That cop needs a new job
That poor baby boy
😥😓😢🥹😇
This cop asks too many questions! Just do your job!
so sorry but thank God you were able to get help for your momma. You are so brave kiddo. Praying your momma has full recovery
Always break the back window so you can climb in there
God bless them
Thank god for the police The Little guy would’ve never been able to save mommy by himself 😢
Was that Liam?
Dude taking his time
Sometimes fight or flight kicks in. People actually have to make decisions in life. This cop was deciding if he should risk his own life getting into the water to help that family. He took his time, wish he’d decided sooner. But you know what ? His response was normal ! And the woman was rescued.  Not everyone who wears the uniform is ready to risk their lives, even when they swear an oath. We don’t know the thoughts that went through his head. Sometimes he easy on people.

He said she was in there  Why ask again
Wow save the day and get to go home early 🎉🎉
Is anybody in there????? Tf do you mean! How many times does that young man have to scream "HELP HER"? This cop is slow as s***. Thank god that the other guy was there too 🙏🏻 This cop needs to be trained what an emergency looks like
The cop took a lil too long,, the boy told him all he needed to know from the beginning.
This put me in full blown tears omg. I hope they okay!😢 🙏🏿
I can’t swim so nope I ain’t jumping in sorry don’t know how deep the water is
I cried watching this hoping that this woman was okay. Thank you Jesus for this young man's bravery and love for his mother ❤️
Cops be so useless
“She’s having a seizure, she’s sunk, she’s in the water!” How much clearer did this boy need to be to make this half witted cop move faster than the speed of treacle? “Is she in there?” The dim witted cop yells from the bank in his nice dry clothes. No mate, she’s not in there where her distraught son just told you she was. This person near the car is just enjoying a swim in all their clothes. Unfortunately police work doesn’t attract the nation’s best and brightest.
The cop was do I have to get in the water…
The child’s desperation - fearing the loss of his Mother was heartbreaking.  Tank God for all of the Angels on Assignment.  May she recover.  May all stay blessed,
What's with all the questions? Do work with your scary ass!  Was he thinking this was a possible ambush?
This scene took place about 20 miles from where I live. The cop and other passerby were honored by the City of West Orange and the Orange County Commissioner’s Court for their gallantry…!!!
Is mom ok?
Jesus uses whom he chooses! Do glad the mother is ok and the son was the real Hero!
Where the heck was she driving to
kid did more than the cop sadly
Stupid cop. Anybody in there? Is this a sedan? What time is it? You got insurance ? Pokémon or digimon ?
He move too slow for me
how in tf did she even get there😂😂
Poor boy was traumatized to the max and am glad he's ok and mom is in ICU BUT . .WHO ARE WE HEARING TALKING UNDER WATER? Right towards the end of the video.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
(Hears the woman scream) is someone in there ? 🤦🏾‍♂️
Stuppid question.  De boy say😢
Always a black chick and her kids over exaggerating
Scary ass cop hears a child saying shes having a seizure sees a car under water and asks is somebody in there😳😡😡🤦🏿🤦🏿 like this kid drove himself into the pond 😑. Great job kid hope you Mom is ok 💯❤️👑💪🏿✊🏿🫡
The way that baby made sure to get his mama help!!!!! God bless them
Did the press show this
Looks like the cop was there in the right place at the right time
Wow! Child waves down brave officer after his mom had a seizure and drove into the water. Lord have mercy 🥺 🙏
Her license might get revoked after this but its a small price to pay to live another day
Horrible police seemed like he didn't wanna get wet. The lil boy was telling you the issue
My hod bless everyone involved. I pray his mama survives god bless his brave soul ❤
if it ain't your time to go you ain't going
With all due respect I hope that cop never have to rescue me because he was in no sense of urgency at all.
The cop asked if anyone in there. Duh!
Is somebody in there?No officer I’m just washing my car in the middle of a pond.
The brave young man approached the officer,  asked for help...he arrives with the police and appears to jump back in the water you can see him again and hear him saying  my mom help her! The re-affirming and second guessing could of costed a life...the son is a hero...lets not disregard his actions and determination to save his mother.
that cop was really dragging his feet😒
🙏🏻🤍
I lost my mind too when my mom had a seizure in front of me when I was a kid. That is terrifying especially when he was in the car with her and they crashed!!
This cop moved slow as hell. It really pisses me off to watch this.
❤❤❤💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
THAT COP LOOKED LIKE HE DIDNT WANT TO DO ANYTHING
Why would he need to ask is somebody in there. Wasting precious time
Beautiful beautiful soul
That cop pissed me off, and that's all I'm a say😢
But Blue Lives Don’t matter. Remember F the police?
The son knows she has seizures, so why does she have a license, why is she driving, why isnt she arrested for child endangerment?
🙏
GOD BLESS YOU FOR YOUR PRECIOUS HEART I THAN GOD FOR THOESE LIKE YOU GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY'S SUCCESS SINCERELY SHARON SATTLER
Thankyou officer.I pray the Lord keeps you safe everyday Officer and all your brothers and sisters in blue 💙💙💙
And praise the good ones.
The cop telling EMS to step it up because he wouldn't.
😱😱
People quick enough to point out Police officers for doing wrong but noone seems to take notice when they do things which are so right, like saving a life. Well done officer  ❤
Thank God for the child reacting quickly to save his mom 🙏❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Some cops are so STUPID n slow and he's supposed to be highly trained
kid- “my moms in there”  cop-“is somebody in there”  gotta be the dumbest shit ive heard today
My God😢 THANK YOU TO THE HEROS THAT SAVED HIS MOTHER.  May you forever be BLESSED. ❤❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
What amazes me is that even tough the child is clearly on the verge of hyperventilation he managed to say the first and most important thing: "she's javing a seazure".  The officer tough disappoint me, why the hell he's asking if there's someone there when the child is screaming: "help my mum?"  Every minute count!
Moving mighty slow to rescue 🙄
This cop wasted so much time asking dumbass questions kid soaking wet and tells you exactly what happened this officer shouldnt have hesitated... and they protect us ... yea ok
Yes, ese policía es un bastardo.
I read some of the comments. Have anyone who were making these negative comments actually save someone from a car that was underwater? No. But, you are commenting what they should or shouldn't done. The camera? Bodycam. Why taking so long? Ever try to move fast in water? Why the door won't open? There must equal pressure on both sides of the door or break the glass to equalize the pressure.
It's so ridiculous how the cop just takes his sweet time, and he didn't even save her, some highschool kids end up jumping in the water to save the day 🤦‍♂️
Why ask if someone is in there he told you it was 😳
👍👍👍❤
🙏🏾
Is somebody in there? Are you armed?
Oh my goodness this stuff always makes me cry and break my heart.. Thank you Lord for saving this woman's life that day❤❤❤❤
😢
Good lord
Lol. Slowest rescue ever
Sure take your time guys….
L'enfant avait du mal à parler car la peur et l'angoisse l'ont envahient.
That cops response time was piss poor.
This is why as an Epileptic,  I haven't driven in 15yrs & will never drive again! I can't risk another's life for convenience.
😂😂😂😂
If she died, I would blame the cop for asking “Is somebody in there” twice while her child cries for her in the background. In these situations, seconds matter. Ngl that pissed me off.
I Surprised he helped asking a cop for help and being black idk.. I'm glad he helped tho thank God
I hope she is okey . Her son is brave
The child beat the officer to the car.  The heart of a child.
My God. I pray she made it.😢
Thank you Jesus for sending that officer!
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Praying for the Family
Did she live?
I just want to jump in the screen and help him. That poor baby boy. That desperate cry is heart wrenching
Moved way to fucking slow saved or not corrupt ass cops are supposed to act fast im sure this whole situation went on for hours and that mom was still in the car with all the cutting from the footage
So many angels there for there for her❤  Kiddo, YOU ARE AMAZING!!!
😢😢😢
Y do ppl that have seizures have drivers licenses
Yes urgent save now
I feel as tho that cop need to be at a desk or something because he don't need to be on the front line as you can see ..  his rescue skills are ass
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 God bless those of us that truly cares…
"is somebody in there?"  Really bro?
Poor child😢😢😢😢
That poor little boy omg
This is why I jump in situations while telling others to call 911. Twice now, I've saved a person and a burning barn with horses by acting instead of waiting for police. Im sorry, but the cop seeing a child tell him his mom is in the car possibly still having a seizure underwater, and you're leisurely walking to the car was negligent. The hero here was the samaritan who acted fast.
How did the car in up in the pond???
Did that cop just scream out “ tell EMS to step it up” WTF is that cop thinking saying that
Poor boy. He was desperate to save his mom’s life. Sweet baby,
By God's Grace..thank you 🙏🙏❣️
❤❤❤❤❤
Praise The Most High! What a Mother would do for her child or any child be she able to have children or not. God put Mothering in all women. 🫂
That cop had no sense of urgency.  "I know shes in their but i really dont wanna get all wet"
Damn how bout next time step your fucken pace up.  Them damn seconds matter when air is eliminated from the blood and brain.  You do the swan dive and worry about drying off later.
Omg the child desperate to help his mom brakes my heart 😢
Thank you God for all, everyone, who aided in   "Saving" this person's Life🪂🙂‍↕️🕊️❤️❤️❤️
This guy is slow
"Tell EMS to step it up!!" 😮😡🤬🤬🤬🤬  Bro OMG, the kid just told you his mom is in the goddamn car. That should have been all it took. He should have said "Where? Alright, let's go!!!"  You do not carry on an interview before you help someone from drowning.
Bro that cop was not interested in helping
God bless the child and the officer 🙏🏼 🙌 ❤️ 💙
Please GOD i hope she was ok
So sad...that cop should have acted a little faster like he had some actual training and urgency to save a life
Thank you for being a human being . There isint many left out tyere.
It's sad that that cop could say no I'm not going to help her , and it's not illegal
They just took their time 😂 weak
Good samaritain cop? He asked too many questions and hesitated to start.
Thank God mom is alive and everyone is safe. All who helped are heroes! ❤
🙏🙏🙏
Just take your time 😩
will somebody give that young boy a hug for me
This a hole, is someone in there? Yess that's why the kid brought you over an why someone is still trying by the car..use your brain
🌹It sounds like the little boy said she’s having a seizure please help her . Reading through the comments, it sounds like she’s ok. May God continue to bless this family 🙏🏾
How do you ask if somebody is in the car when the boy is TELLING YOU!!! 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
You took way to long buddy. Is she in there is the car unlocked what ?
He is so brave
Goodness gracious cop, were you waiting for word-bubbles to float up or something?!?!?! Sheesh.
Guess we're all different under stressful situation but the cop needs better training
Did she live?
The cop taking his sweet ass time
Wow that cop really asked is the car open
This is why we need good And the good samaritan laws to protect them when they're helping others
this cop was sure taking his sweet time man. with drowning every second counts and im sure he knows that. makes me mad
Thank you Jesus  🙏 🤲
Why do they keep giving me these propaganda videos of the police and Drake on youtube?
God Bless this samaritan and his family.  God help her using this man🙌🙌❤️❤️
THANK YOU ALL FOR SAVING THIS LITTLE BOY’S MOTHER. GOD BLESS YOU ALL
The child told u she is in the car y the hell r u walking yelling is anyone in there this is a sorry pos officer right here
The cop had no sense of urgency.
😮❤🙏🥺🙏
I lost my mom to seizures recently, this broke my heart hearing that child desperately crying for help. Praying everyone is OK
Don’t they carry a glass punch on their belt?
Is the little man and he's momma all right ? Thats what we wannah know. 😮😮😮
So some poor kid runs to you out of breath and tells you his mom is dying and asks to please help. You take your sweet ass time. I’m not a cop but if some poor baby comes to me for help I’m jumping in there and doing all I can to help. Come one now.
Thank you officer for being a stand up guy in this situation. You got wet all over your clothes and equipment. There is a new type of punch to break car window glass. It is said the last five years or so the type of glass is harder therefore needs a different style of tool. Still you guys did a bang up job for this lady thankfully her child was there to raise the alarm. Whether in need of her medication or fear stopping when she was getting sick, people must learn to make better choices when in a self emergency. Thank you men for all you stepped up to do the right thing in this rescue and situation. 😮😮❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊
I’m glad she’s okay but the sense of urgency from the cop is sickening
😥😥😥😥
That cop sure did take his time walking to ask more questions. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Taking camera everywhere
Samaritan? The cop was just doing his job and very poorly. He was the slowest he could be while watching someone literally drown🤦🏻‍♀️
Omg this made me cry poor Mijo I hope your mom is ok prayers that she survived....😢
God bless her and her brave son
Omg that kid was just as much to thank as the cop he literally saved his mom's life you can see he's soaking wet he probably just got out of that pond too & just took off running having no idea what to do or where to even run thank God that cop was there when that family needed him
😢😢❤
❤❤❤
@bhumphries1360 thank you
Did she do it on purpose?
The little boy is a hero he found somebody who could help his mother and that's all he needed to do they took it from there and thank God he didn't have to go without his mother
That cop and the child really did a great job. Well done for the cop that just rushed to save his mother life and for the child tried to be strong to ask for help...
Aww thank the lord for that sheriff!!!
Damn, take your fucking time
He moving like he really didn't want to help as soon as he saw 'blackness'. The boy is screaming to you frantically pointing and saying she sunk, sooo yes shes in there.   In this man walking to the car talking about some is somebody in there is the car unlocked as soon as I heard the boy say 'she sunk'...'a seizure...'?! & see him pointing to the car (and whether or not I look and I see the car yet or not) - I'm running to the car or any direction he's pointing to ASAP.   I'm then yanking the door open or busting the windows. Period.  This tape and this horrible police officer need to be reviewed and fired.   He did not go to save this woman out of the 'kindness' of his heart, or because it was the right thing to do and should not be held a hero for a Good Samaritan a kind Samaritan none of those things. HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT! He ONLY 'saved' her because the camera was on. Not only is he an embarrassment and a poor excuse for a police officer. Bump that. What a despicable human being. Ugh. Im sick watching this 🤮
cop didn’t wanna get his uniform wet 😂  “ help my mom she in the car “ ,  “ yea but is somebody in there” 👀
Mam drowning are you in there? Well if you don't respond..............
Now this is protecting and serving!  Kudos to the cops and civilians who helped save this woman’s life 😊
😢I’m glad everyone is ok
Prayers for the family
The son was desperately trying to save his mother.  I hope she's okay because her son needs her and loves her.
OH my god 😮😮😮😮
He is a cop… isn’t that his job to serve and protect?
Thanks be to GOD for you Dear Brother for Loving thy Neighbor as thyself may GOD Bless you Always ❤😇🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This cop happened to be parked on that side road just a few yards down from where that young boy came out from searching for help!! Could you imagine! If he wasn't there at that time, it would be a whole different outcome for them babies. God/Jesus/Creator/Ancestors whatever u like sure was looking out for them! Wow
GOD BLESS🙏🏽
Watching that brave young man… I’m glad is mama will be okay ❤
Don’t forget they hopped up in there with alligators and god knows what else to save that women. God is real
The world we live in  is sad
Cop taking his good ol time
Thank you for helping rescue her!
Thank you, God! This re an through my soul thank you Jesus. God bless her son, man.. and her may she heal accordingly in Gods steps!🙏🏾
Thumb 👍
How many times did the baby have to ask
Poor liam
The boy and the law enforcement team are heroes of the day♥️I hope his mom survived 😢
Poor kid gunna be stressing every time his mama drives again 😭
Man, those cops sure take their time when literally every second counts... Poor kid he's sayin she's in there underwater and the cop acting like he dont wanna go in the water at first 🙄
Little kid: my mom is in the car. She had a seizure. Cop: Is someone in there, hello someone in there? 🤔
Spent so much time asking if anybody was in there and then couldn't even break the window. This cop is a chump
Jesus Christ this cop was so reluctant to go in the water to save lives.
Jesus will heal her 🙏❤. God please bless this family and bring this little boys mom back to him safely and in better condition, healthy happy and unharmed. AMEN!
The cop asking if is somebody in there. After the kid just mentioned his mom was in there. TfkS is that
How brave and on point was that kid for swimming to safety to find help for his mom. HE SAVED THEM BOTH... as the cop irritated me. Im sure we all saw how IMPERITIVE It was to save this family...😌
@bhumphries1360 thank you 🙏🏼
White people are so slow to help colored folks. Asking stupid questions and hesitating. The child  has been clear in speaking and clearly distressed. 🤦‍♂️🤬🤬🤬🤬
Slooooooow af
Oh my. The tone of that babies voice sent chills up my spine. I sure hope she made a full recovery. Her lil guy saved her life ❤️
Wow I lived in bridge city tx for a year and I would get groceries from the Walmart in orange from time to time. I know exactly where this little pond is.
She black so he’s moving slow , shows the difference in mentally when it comes to race. Pathetic fr
That's the job they sign up for!!!!!!
💙
Cop took his sweeet time
My mom had a seizure when I was a little kid when she had it mom me and my sister blasted through 2 guard rails into oncoming traffic passed that and blew through one last one and hit a tree seizures are no joke that little boy and his mom are as lucky to be here as I was
Wow thank you God
Officer = useless!!!
That cop was slow as hell
@bhumphries1360...thank you for the update.  Bless the man who rescued the lady.  I just bought a device to open a car window against the pressure of water and it cuts a seat belt as well.  All cars should come with one.  Very cheap to purchase on Temu, Amazon, etc.
The new safety glass you can't break. The nanny state would rather you drown.
I’m praying for mom, son and family that the Lord guides the physicians taking care of mom and heals mom all of their heart and minds from this tragedy….🙏
The cop just walked instead of running
No sht someones in there he just told you EXACTLY what was going on SMFH !!!!!!
Love ❤😂❤😊❤😂
Thank you !
The cop no urgency what so ever😮
Defund those hero’s!
Im kind of thrown off by the cops slow reaction and the "is someone in there" question. Clearly they're trying to save someone smh
West Orange is about 10’ above sea level. There is a lot of water to go into if you run off the road. I lived there for a while. This woman is very lucky to be alive.
Another useless cop who thinks just their presence brings anything to the table lol he really asked “is anybody in there?” He must be scared of the water touching his knees
Why they ask if the cars unlocked…just goo 😭
Literally no sense of urgency.
Bless his little heart ❤
Kid:  My mom had a seizure. She in there. Cop: Is somebody in there???
Yea cmon, that cop was in no hurry. They're was another person trying to rescue her already
My ear literally felt like I was under water.  It felt like I had water in my ears. That boy and the officer are real heroes
THANK U';  For lising to the kid..❤❤
How can drive in the sea?
Thank you so much ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The cop did not seem interested…
What a brave strong young man.
Thank you to all rescuers!
Ohh...
That guy's an idiot he said is anybody in there smh and he's just moving at a snails pace smh
🙏🇺🇸💪🚑
God is good❤
The Good Samaritan had more urgency than the cop!
How you mean if shes in there?
You can hear a screaming and he has to ask if someone in there?
The boy already told you she‘s in there. What a stupid question from the cop.
Could he go any slower
Thank you for the update...my heart is pounding from watching that
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢
Good Samaritan?
police officer was slow to help and react he didnt care if she dies
This why we need to all carry a window breaker, saves time.  Still, I am glad that everyone is safe because rescuing people in the water can be dangerous for those helping others.  Glad that others were helping.
He didn’t care to me he gone yell is somebody in there the lil boy just said he was like Erks  my soul
These damn skinny pictures you cant see s thing
Omg so scary!  My praysrs to  mom and son 🙏🙏
Definitely crocodiles in that 😭
He saved his momma little does he know
God bless yall ❤
Take the camera out and says I don't want to buy crack and drive
Good job son ,we have good people  thank you for being you son of god
OMGod-that poor boy watching his mom trapped in the car. Thank you to the citizen and policeman for their rescue! Thank God she survived!! ❤
Hope she ok
Did anyone else think why is the cop moving SO SLOW??????
A few years ago I was driving and had a seizure my car flipped and I woke up a few months later after being in acoma I happy they got her out her sons face just broke my heart 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️
Thanj you Jesus, for your grace, and mercy!❤ this ending
God bless everyone who was involved,...The Cop didn't want to Over react , he handled professionally and gracefully ❤
Ow lest hear you sad cowards try to blame the cops for this one! 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️ Well done blue!🙏🏿
He didn't care one bit. He puts on the uniform for a whole different reason but he knew that the camera was rolling.
Fricken BRAVE!!
God bring good people together for a reason. It wasn't his mom time. Thank god for those good people and I Thank God for those good people. 👍 🙏🙏🙏
That cop sure did take his damn time.
Poor kid
I think the kid did a great job, now yes he is scared but you can tell he had to stay calm and went to get help, gave the officer detail on what, when and why, was well alert to his surroundings at that young age he became a young man!
God was at work through the child he's so brave
The policeman could have showed some more urgency
This baby asking someone to save his mama broke me 💔
Must be the South 😂 that cop can’t even talk fast much less move at a reasonable speed
And democrats want to defund the police.... Thank you so much for all you do to risk your life for us. Anyone and everyone. You are greatly appreciated.  Stay safe.
Sound like the cop didn’t want to get wet..  that cop definitely wasn’t going in that water if he was alone
Thank you so much 🙏
I hope momma's doing okay now.
Not really a good samaritan when they are a cop. Don't get it twisted.
I fell bad for him
Did she live?
And this is why people with epilepsy should not be driving. Shout out to her son. He’s a brave little boy ❤
This made cry omg healing innerg ❤❤❤
Why he keep asking if his mom is in the car? The boy ain’t speaking Spanish is he?
Cop acts like no big deal I’ll walk slow and ask questions to a person already in the water trying to save the lady. POS
Thank God  her son was traveling  with her . What if .she was alone  on the road . Thank  God  her son was able to  get  out,
That poor baby.  😢
He needed to engage the woman in communication. This let's her know to hang on, help is here, it tells the rescuers that she is ok and fighting for life. The communication is essential! 🙏
Good Samaritan? I hate when cops get labled that. They took the oath and its there career to be a public servant. Not a good Samaritan just doing what they're paid to do
Man I hope she made it that was hard to watch
What a coward.....get in the fn water and save her the boy already told you she was in there...wtf
That’s terrifying for everyone involved! My gosh it must have been pure adrenaline that takes over in a life or death situation! 😮
She needs to get a service dog or something to prevent this😢
Thank God, that mom was rescued.   This little boy will be traumatize.      Thanks to the ppl. Involved in rescue
The pure panic in his little sweet face broke my heart. Prayers for her healing and for his trauma. Thank you to all who helped them in that scary situation
How come we don’t see those short faces women cops doing this stuff? 😅😅😅😅
Why did he have to tell you more than once his mom was in there?
I saw this in the news the other day his face made me feel desperate myself.. what a great kid, God allowed her to survive because of him
His mom had a seizure while driving that's crazy
My beloved “Mommy” suffered from seizures too. 😢 Hearing the fear 😰 and terror in this little boy’s voice cut right through to my soul.  I’ve been. He’s such a Brave little man. Bless him and the wonderful Police Officer 👮🏽‍♀️ for helping and saving his Momma. Both are true heroes. 🦸🏽‍♀️  🙏🏽😇❌⭕️🫡
That kid literally just said she's in there and then you ask if she in there
"Is somebody in there" while the kid is screaming "my mom is in there"?
Did anyone else see the other video where the cop looks like a complete sociopath with no haste?
Oh wow I hope everything is ok. 🙏🏽
That little boy just broke my heart!! Thank god he was able to find help!
How did the boy get out? Did he shut the door after he got out?
I dont believe the cop did much other than tell EMS to step it up !!
Omg poor baby😢😢
We need more community 🙏 ❤  and less  hate.
Had it not been for the Good Samaritan the cop would’ve let that lady die.    People we gotta stay together and help each other, bc obviously the cops will not
I couldn’t tell what I was looking at at the end
This is terrible
The distress is that poor child, hurt my heart.  Hope she's OK.
Orange is know as the most racist county in Texas. Thank God for this officer.
OMG, THAT'S SO SO SCARY 😮😢❤
Od course it’s a hellcat lmao
Look at all these cop haters give praise to the cop. How ironic
Tbh, the cop was giving off vibes of "you better not be making me get wet for no reason, are you SURE theres someone in there?!" Smh props for saving her but, it seemed to be reluctantly almost. Im glad shes doimg ok now tho and her little boy and the other guy already trying to help deserve recognition
The cop was so nonchalant.. “Is someone in there” Get yo ass in the water and check!..
The questions are annoying when the situation is Obvious. No time for it.
What a hero.  I sure hope his mother is ok😢.  So sad hearing him.  So glad the officer stepped into action. ❤
Gotta luv the urgency and reaction from this guy, gals it all worked out
Thank you @bhumphries1360 and Thank God for his Mercy.
Republicans can't drive
Jesus . Thank you . ❤
That little boy saved her life!!! Thank God for him!!!
😢😢😢😢
The mans voice was so calm and reassuring, that you just knew he would take care of her. I'm so glad he was in the right place at the right time. I do wonder why she ended up in the water.
Black lives matter
😭😭😭🙏🏿
So I'm going to guess that's the mother survived
Thank God... I hope all is well thank The Lord for this cop
Such a bad police men… the car is locked? Stupid
Has that cop ever heard of urgency?
mam you can’t park there
There are good cops in this world
Pesky racist cops.
My heart and prayer goes out to this family of hope all is well
😰😰😰😰😰😰
Amazing boy! In a panic, he acted quickly, spoke precisely and clearly! Hope his mom is recovered. I hope she sees this video sometime. She should be so proud of her son!
That's a slow cop
Not all heroes wear capes
the cop did not want to get in that water i woukdve dove in not stooe there and asked if she was in there come on and im not just talking big ive done it before most peopke i think would but being a cop i think makes you think of most people as subhuman therfore they are willing to risk their. lives to save fellow officers more so then citizens idk just a theory based on observation thats the problem with making some people above others the only way to fix it is common sense let police do their jobs but make them subject to every single law and punishment that everyone else is subject to that and getting rid .of laws that soly impeed a persons  right to self determination as long as they dont hurt. anyone else like drug crimes not everyone that does drugs commit other crimes and some  people that dont do drugs commit the same of crimes drug laws are designed to prevent so therefore let people do drugs and arrest them if they commit a crime anything else is equivalent to thought crime
How many times does the boy have to say "HELP HER!!!"  instead of the cop trying to immediately break the window. I'm glad that they both  are ok.  Much love to the Good Samaritan who took action first and asked questions later.
What don’t you get about hurry up someone needs help?!? Goddamn cop what you waiting for the second coming? Get your ass in there
Well done to this little boy. Cant say the same about the police man, he wasn't on the ball at all. I hope mama is ok does anyone know?? This little man was amazing for getting the help. His fear brought me to tears. ❤
Police full of shit
Did the cop really ask if there was somebody in there shouting at the car? Smh I mean I'm glad everything worked out in the end but damn.
That cop took his lazy ass time
Useless cop I’m surprised he didn’t start crawling nonsense of damn urgency as the child is stating MY MOM IS IN THERE HELP HER!!!!!!
idk...he was told somebody was in there but he still asking if somebody in there? thats weird
I'm praying in the name of Jesus Christ that this mama is healed to perfection & she gives her & son to Jesus Christ amen.
Why the hell did the cop wait so long to go in.
Boy could have ran up to me and I would have been so quick to call paramedics and immediately hop in. Time is precious in these situations. There we’re observable risks that heightened the complexity and severity of the problem. Hope mom is ok hope boy is ok
Mann u know what when I seen that White man come out with the lady it broke my heart because this right here is what it’s all about. A persons life was saved no matter what. God bless that man and the family
That son is his Mom's guardian angel 😇
Can he move any slower? GEEZ
Poor kid how desperate he is. Thank God for him.
That little is very strong, intelligent and he loves his momma! Thank God for everyone who assisted that family in distress 💞
That cop had no get up in him. Pathetic
❤❤hero, you are ❤❤❤
Thank you for saving her
Why don't all cops carry glass breakers.
Thank God for this brave boy and this incredibly wonderful police officer. May the Good Lord bless him with love, prosperity and kindness!
Now that’s a cop!
Thank you both for the help of those people 🙏🏽
I get chills everytime I watch the little boy trying to explain she's in the water
❤God Bless😢and she was saved😊❤
Blessed be God🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a good and brave son! My heart 😭 he had to experience something so tragic and frightening. I hope the family is well. 🤍🤍🤍
thank you so much for the updates…relieved🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
“yeah my momma! help her!” thanks to that little boy being a fighter and a hero along w the cop and the gentleman who was already in the water this lady’s life was saved. praying for her and her baby boy.
Thank God she got saved🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
No a good Samaritan looked like they were saving someone while the cop was still asking if someone is inside while the child Cruz saying his mom is in the car
Wow. Gracias a. Dios que. La. Sacaron. Gracias. A su. Hijo. Y. A. Los. Policías. Y. Dios. Que. Le hizo. El. Milagro
How is anybody supposed to say..yeah im here. When their under water.
Omg. I can only imagine the panic that this poor baby experienced trying to get help 😢😢
jesus, take your time officer lmao no sense of urgency in a situation like this is ridiculous, taking his sweet ass time when the youngster is frantically begging for help
😮oh my bless to this young man a praise the cop that helped them❤
Little boy- "help my mom had a seizure she sunk in the water"  Cop- " Is someone in there??"  No sir it's just a car in the water and panicking child begging you to help 🙄🤦‍♀️
PORQUE NO DEJA EL MOBIL...ES UNA SITUACIÓN COMPLICADA...NO LO ENTIENDO
I was praying no Aligators😢
The most uncalm calm person i've ever seen... clearly worried and panicking, but still stringing together coherent and clear sentences so he could be understood, which in it's own way is helpful. If you panic and i can't understand you, how can i help. 3 heroes in this clip.
Geez commenters, get a grip.
Pobrecito el niño
U make me cry 😭😭 the u
The cop taking his sweet time walking to the car 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Wow… take your time bro… the kid already told you his mom was in there. You should be fired from your job.
Good Samaritan my ass.... There was no rush, no urgency... More like a liability
"shes having a seizure".... Shouldnt be driving, huh?
What a dumb ass walk so slow , is anyone in. There. No shit
The child said my mom is in there ..he is asking is anybody in there..seriously..
Anybody know how this resulted in the end?
He was taking too long asking if she was in there!
And anice policeofficer
Em sorry. I mean yes, good the officer helped but is that not his job?
🙏🙏🙏
Well, Duh.  The boy already said she sunk in the water. What a dumb question. I just don’t know why people hears it but still have to ask is anyone in there. If the person is unconscious can’t answer, then you got an excuse to dump them and leave is that it?  I ask you haw can person talk while under the water. That’s a dumb cop, he need retraining 😂
Is the car unlocked? Really!!!!
How you get in there? Far from the main road
Slow ass acting cop 🤦🏻‍♂️
Is somebody in there 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Is someone in there? Is someone in there? 😂 Because I ain’t going in no damn water unless I have to
❤
“Is someone in there”🤦
The dramatic rescue????
I cried watching this. This cops asks is somebody in there , omg the son literally told you his mom is having a seizure. What is wrong with you?
Thank God for that boy and that cop
@bhumphries1360 Thanks for the update.  Thanks to the person who stopped to help them. ❤🙏
Thank you
This cop bouta get a participation trophy
That cop is fuckin useless lol.
The cop lacked way too much urgency
What a brave child ♥️
That was so touching when his son with her son tried cough for help and Officer Kim and being brave and helping him
Prais God!  Praying for a full recovery 🙏
I gotta say that this freaking Cop didn't really seem too in a hurry to save someone! Asking someone to do you're job is insane !!! Especially a kid when he's literally telling you who's in the car. This video is pissing me off... I really hope the lady got saved and made a full recovery. 🙏 I hope this agency has a full evaluation of this situation and the way it was handled by this cop and does a retraining or let's this cop go, because obviously this cop is in the wrong career...His number one priority is to save life's and his isn't!
🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is the America I know! Brave and willing to put your life on the line for other Americans!!
Dang, glad she's going to be ok. After 3 weeks of icu, she's now breathing on her own. I grew up down there, open water, rivers and canals everywhere, and she just happened to hit a pond in the middle of a giant field 😮‍💨
This cop talking to a submerged car is like 911 operators asking if they‘re breathing after a dead body was reported
Why does this look like it’s from the 90’s. Lol.
It's funny how everybody says they're scared of the police bless this child life for helping his mother God bless😮❤
Thank you God 😢
I understand staying calm under pressure, but that cop really needed a little more urgency. Seconds matter. Good Samaritan saved the day
Cops be fast, asertive, and ready😂
The cop “is someone in there”  The kid just said his mom multiple times
Thank you for following up😊
The cop didn't save her the guy he was filming did...
If he wasn’t holding the damn camera…
I love this ❤️ thank you Lord
I don't necessarily think people who have seizures should be aloud to drive. That's a danger to themselves and others. And from what I understand seizures kinda happen on they own without warning?? Or am I wrong?
😭🫣😮
God bless 🙌
Thank God!🎉 Hallelujah!
That police officer had 0 sense of urgency
I always feel like these rescues could go faster!  Like windows seems to be hard to break???  Cop cars should have winches on them! I think that might help sometimes.
The cop is a chicken-shit!
Thank you GOD .for sending her help
lame ahh cop didn’t want to get wet unless he ABSOLUTELY HAAAAD TO.  Wasting crucial moments.
Remember....REAR WINDOWS ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN THE EASIEST
''Is somebody in there?"  Seriously? How could she answer???🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Thank you God for the putting the right people in the right places and for putting such bravery in the little boys heart. I pray her a full recovery and him a full mental recovery
That poor baby, I know he was scared and traumatized. 😢 I just want to hug him.
I'm so glad the son and the police officer and the other person was there. I'm glad she's ok. Praying for them
This gave me chills😢 What a brave little boy and thank God for the people who helped🙏🏻🙏🏻
The fact that is says dramatic rescue , I can't with the Internet
Having epilepsy myself. This is my greatest fear. But I gotta go to work.
Omg poor kid I can't imagine bro he was so scared thank god she's ok
The cop was asking hetorical questions , like the obvious , smh  were doomed 😂
Probably was doing crack or meth while driving
Glad this cop acted with such haste and made sure to ask a bunch of questions before attempting to save a person in a submerged vehicle! That was a close one
Dear Lord, that child held it together enough to explain what happened.  I hope his mother made it!  And, good work po po!
That cop was is no hurry to save her. “iS tHe cAr UnLoCkEd??” Like bro idk hurry and go find tf out jeeze lol
❤❤❤
Thank God she's okay. Happy her son was filled with the spirit of bravery and that those men were equipped with the same to help.
😢🙏🏽🙌🏽
Jonquetta Winbush is the mother's name. She's expected to make a full recovery.
Ghetto was on crack😅😅
That poor baby 😢I’ll never understand why people who have seizures take the risk of driving exactly because this can happen
MERCI MERCI MERCI AU SAUVETEUR  ET PLEIN D'AMOUR POUR CET ENFANT APEURÉ  POUR SA MAMAN QUI VA HEUREUSEMENT S'EN SORTIR ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
THIS SHOWS WORK REAL HEROS LOOK LIKE .  NOT JUST LIP SERVICE!!!
Hey, he should not have waited so long he could say clearly the kid was telling him someone was there and the water was moving. This is a travesty.
So proud of this young man. Brought tears to eyes. 😢
😢🙏🙏🙏💗💗💗
Well done guys 🙏🏻
Bro took forever
That cop 100 percent didn’t want to get his pants wet.
Those poor babies, doing everything they can to save their mama❤❤
It's not a good samaritan. It's her son desperate to get his mommy out😢
That precious brave boy....teared up after hearing his desperate cries for help for his mom. It's fight or flight, and he FOUGHT!! What a little hero!!
Always have window punch in your cars!
Thank goodness on the bravery of the  lovely getting help for his Mother & the awesome man that in the Rescue❣️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Making me  cry, so sad
I pray that everything is OK.🙏🙏🙏
As an older woman, I know all about, STAY CALM, etc. But, the man seemed to have ZERO CARE, concern, sound of 'urgency.'  etc. THAT, in itself, is what gave me anxiety.   Really.
I truly hope everyone is ok  That little boys face and his voice tell it all.
I love how the officer embraced the moment by telling the boy to come on and hop in❤
The latest story I saw said she is alive and breathing on her own even though she wasn't initially.
That is the slowest moving cop ever.
The cop need to "step it up" maybe a little haste.
So the good Samaritan is more effective than a police officer whose job is to do that type of stuff!! 😅
Thank you god for you sent a angel from heaven above to help this beautiful mother of this precious children to get her some help because she was having a seizure by allowing her son to  cry out for help and to allow some good samitations people to help save this beautiful mother and this young lady life , she can be live for her beautiful children one day ❤❤❤❤
May god continue to bestow his blessings on these folks.
She shouldn't have a license if she has seizures
I’m sorry it is literally the jobs description of a police officer to do what he did and if I’m going to judge how he did it, I would say he did mediocre to a bad job. in a situation like that every second counts, the kid is screaming My mom is in there, Please help her and the cop is casually walking towards the car then he casually asks if anybody’s in the car and the damn kid is saying yes my mom is in there. Then he asks is the car unlocked?? I know 1,000,000% if that was a police car in the water he would’ve stepped up his game and rushed to the rescue.
Damn bruh what a savior. The kid and the cop.
Cop was moving slow asf
Thank God for Good Samaritans and good police force
People need to slow down! Drive like morons these days! Big hurry to get home and watch ticktock!
Thank You JESUS 🙏... DESPERATE CRIES for His MOM❤❤ THANK YOU ALL who HELP his MoM!❤❤
Yeah, but how did it happen? Like, how did she get off the road into the water?
This company is training or either fired
He's too calm if you ask me
Try to always keep  a window cracker I'm the car.
I hope she is fine. Bless the little one. Broke my heart.
Listening to how the cop was ignoring kids answers i truely believe if good samaritian wasnt there he would have left her to drown
THANK YOU GOD FOR GIVING THIS LITTLE BOY WISDOM TO GET HELP .AND FOR THIS COP WHO WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME!..THANK GOD SHE IS ALIVE, ....WE NEVER KNOW WHEN DRIVING IF SOMETHING COULD GO WRONG. GOD BLESS ALL WHO HELPED THIS MOTHER!❤
White cop...must be his fault!!!
iS tHeRE SoMe oNe iN tHEre?  No fucking shit did you not listen to anything that’s been said get in the fucking water
I think the cop could have been moving with more speed. Seemed to mosey a little too much. Hesitation is a bad trait for a police officer.
THIS IS MY SETX!! (South East Texas)
...whoever in there is under water dawg
Woow
White Supremacy... Think Again , Manard !
Did the cop say is somebody in there?? When the baby said she's having a seizure
I cannot BELIEVE some of these comments. Those of you, know exactly who I’m speaking of. You are all going to hell.
So someone is drowning and you keep asking is somebody in there? Like I can talk under water like Nemo, stupid
Glad they were able to save her & now we know the body cam's are water proof they should always be on
Why do videos stop far shorter than they should?Is there some other link?People want us to click on so we can see the whole goddamn video
Dumme ammys 😂
👍🏾👍🏾🙏🏾
Oh poor baby he's terrified for his momma. Thank God for him keeping calm enough to run for help! Pray that she's okay!
Sad beginning, but thanks 🙏🙏 to the quick response to the child's crying for help the quick response from the policeman,it turned out to be a blessed ending. May GOD continue to bless you and the rescue team ❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Police officers will never get the respect they deserve but they will be ridiculed for every slight mistake they make. If I know ungrateful people such as those in this comment section exist I would not save anybody as a police officer. Thank them for not being like me.
Wtf wtf wtf is this fucking cop doing why he wait
Heaven sent ❤❤❤❤
The boy save my mama she in water That cop is somebody in there
AWESOME job by all involved. Thanks for your service officer. The kid's desperation just broke my heart
I just hate the slow response it makes my blood boil.. is someone’s in there of course he told you his mom had a seizure and he’s soaked with water.. thankfully she’s okay..
The little kiddo who come for help is a true HERO.
God bless that child...The fear 😢
No rush
Did she make it????
There are still some good people in this sad world 😢❤ Relieved to hear that little man still has his momma.
That my cousin
This is not a good sumeritan cop, it's just a cop actually doing what he is supposed to do rather than puling people over for no brake light.
im literally in tears right now😰
This is a fear of mine. Trapped under water must be horrible.
I think that officer as well as the child and anyone else participated in rescuing her should be commended amazing
He begged you to help his mom yet you're sitting there asking if anyone's in the vehicle
The questions the cop were asking 😠
How dumb is this. The son tells him his mom is in the car. He perceives to ask questions. Especially is the car unlock.
They just told you someone is in there😅, why slow walk yourself asking dumb questions ❓❓😭😭
Oh my god..
Thank you for your kindness.
Wow! Brave boy you did good.  Thank you heroes that saved his mom.
“Is someone in there?” Bro wym
"Is the car unlocked?" At that point it didn't matter either way. You're still going to have to break in. Smh
I’ve never seen a cop move so slow to save a drowning person before.
Could the cop be/act any slower?
Did you notice that they are white guys helping?? People is always trying to pin white against black but you don’t see things like this go viral
😢❤❤❤❤❤
😢😢😢😳😳😳🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️
Is she in there is somebody in there 🙀 no they just out there to be happy
Good story good work they publicize stories like this more!
She dead
So glad they saved her life. Kudos to the brave young boy that went for help. God is so good!
Kudos to the police this is the behavior that they should All exhibit
That little man i hope hes okay. Im so sorry . So brave and coraugeous.
That cop didn’t do shit that little boy helped and the other Samaritan helped. How is the cop going to scream if anyone is in there the lady was having a seizure she wasn’t going to be able to respond that she needs help 🙄🙄🙄
I got a little boy and this just shattered my heart man I can’t imagine him being in this situation
Is some in their, while the person is drowning is incredibly evil,
Lord Jesus Christ I pray for all these people involved in this video Amen 🙏🏽
Jesus Christ is Lord
I got a little boy and this just shattered my heart man I can’t imagine him being in this situation
Angels send By GOD,,THANK YOU lord,,AMEN❤❤
All in all God to see people of diff.races help each other and working together glad that vwryone is ok hopefully they all recover from this ordeal and they don't go thru this again ❤bless 🙏🏽
Much respect to the officer
God bless that boy !🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
God bless that brave young man and mom !! ❤❤
God bless that baby child
Police are true heroes. And they will want to defund the police.
People with that are siexure prone shouldn't be able to drive.
i think the mom wanted to die because bro who the heck drives into a pond
Bruh this cop as 0 survival instinct how the fuck can you ask iif she in there run and go save her wtf even if there is no one
Why tf was he asking if someone was in there? Just GO man. Is the car unlocked? wtf
God bless this child he was not giving up
PRAISE ALMIGHTY GOD FOREVER AND EVER, AMEN
That little boy! 😢❤❤❤ The terror … I hope they’re both okay 🙏
Thanks for saving this woman, God be with these Brave Police Men and Women🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why on earth is that guy just standing there asking questions when she could be dying and the boy already explained that his mother was in the car
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I’m not praising the officer at the beginning.   Hearing people screaming help!   (in a mocking voice) is there somebody there?  No, you idiot just us fish man with the car.. I would like to believe without question I would’ve already been in the water, but that’s fight or fight in that situation. Nobody can actually answer that question unless they’re there in that moment.
Poor baby absolutely shattered my heart hearing his cries ..... Sweet baby I am so glad he got help for his momma & he was SO BRAVE & strong!  Good on the other man as well who helped! & As well as the cop of course but good on everyone who did all they could to save this woman ❤
That dude wasted to much time
Police asking stupid questions while somebody dying
Absolutely   bless both of them  what a brave boy he is God bless his moma cop and this boy ♥
So the cop wasting time asking dumb questions🤦🏾‍♂️ but he’s rescuing her???
She was unconscious with a pulse and they did he CPR. She was in bad shape but now recovering in the hospital.
💔
The cop didn’t sound right to me slow reacting wasn’t moving fast enough for me..God had the little boy and his mother Blessed them Amen 🙏🏾
That cop had nourgency at all. Etf. Run in water and break window and pull her out. So much wasted time
I love how everybody in the comments section is giving most of the credit to the little boy . That wasn't bravery that was desperation . He was desperate to save his mother . I would like to thank the one man who was in bystander who stepped in to help the lady and I want to support the police officer who did his duty providing assistance to someone in an emergency situation . Those two men are the heroes who saved this woman's life and I hope she's doing well and yes the little boy in his desperation articulated the situation to the police officer and assisted in saving his life but he's not the true hero of the story .

So glad she recovered and doing better. You are a brave son. Mommy is proud of you I’m sure Thank you officer
TRULY PATHETIC...POOR BLACK KID HAS TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THENOFFICER IS A HERO WHEN IN REALITY HE HAD TO BEG FOR HELP SEVERAL TIMES AT VARIOUS POINTS  WHILE THE OFFICER PURPOSELY DID THE LEAST HE COULD EVEEY STEP OF THE WAY ONLY SO HE COULD SAY LOOK I WAS DOING MY JOB....I PROMISE NO BODY CAM WOUKD MEAN MUCH LESS IF NOT ZERO EFFORT TO HELP WHILE HE CALLED THE FIRE DEPT.  Thankfully these was someone around and thankfully they had a mandatory body cam on to help them move a little faster through their bullshyt azz hesitation...smfh....yall see what you want.  I see an officer that did his job because he was being recorded and even then had to have a screaming black kid to beg for help as if a kid stands next to a sinking car screaming boht his mother and no one is in there.  If i was internal affairs i would suspend this officer because in that situation every second counts.
Poor kid
Krisna habathu
That cop took his sweet time getting into that water.
THANK YOU YOUNG MAN 💜🙏💜
Wasted a minute asking if someone who's underwater if they are in there what a idiot
But don't put down the phone! It isn't that urgent.
Bro get moving wtf
Was like an over dramatic episode of Shameless.
Cop sure took his sweet time.🙄
He’s hurt but more worried about his momma 😢❤ please this boy and his momma lord
😢😢😢
God bless you young man& the medical worker. Thank you Jesus for this young mans desperate cries for help. JESUS❤❤❤
Where are all the cop-haters now?
Tf wrong with the cop asking anyone in there wen being told sever times there is
The cop was f'n useless don't give that pig credit for not doing his job
What the heck do you mean is there someone in there? Of course, there is that frantic little boy just told you his mom was in the car having a seizure. I would have been in that water so fast no damn time to ask questions. I pray she's OK God bless the brave little boy who helped save his momma's life both of you are in my thoughts.
The cop didnt do anything but act like he was afraid of getting into the water .
❤ God is watching
It’s a breath of fresh air to see acts of valor hero’s in action.
Good bless them 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾✌🏾✌🏾🥰🧸
Thank you to every one who helped save her!!!!
This had me in tears in one instance a joy the next when they saved her.
The  heart goes out for that little  boy 😢
Gott sei Dank ist das gut gegangen!🙏
Don't depend on cop's to save you. It's not there job
They gotta put these videos out because of the truth thats put out there from bad cops. Every precinct need to smoke out the bad ones, oh wait the people thats over them are corrupt so they have no other choice but to be corrupt so this right here doesn't impress me because i know the intentions of the video and what they really feel in their soul. The motives are (Record this so they will see that its good cops are here) real people that serve and protect doesn't need a badge neither a camera, they "Just Do It" like the Nike Slogan says! Im far beyond manipulation.
Everyone at the scene is responsible for their part in the rescue of this woman. It wasn't her time to go! God still has work for her to do. God bless everyone 🙏 remember we all have a responsibilities for being vigilant about when we are called to do God's work 🙏
Thank god for passer-by. She could've drowned,but god got her son out to save her
Who has the guts to make this video? Is that more important then rescuing?!?
The cop was slow to rescue…. Thank God for the other man
I have a hammer and I need a fire extinguisher for sure
He sure takes his sweet hillbilly time.
Bless that little boy’s heart! How traumatizing for that poor baby. I am so glad that man was there to help him and rescue her.
Bless that child and that officer prayers for the mom and her family
A pressao da água não deixa abrir a porta facilmente
"Is she in there" as kids screaming for him to help. Such urgency while a human being is dying right in front of the guy. Can we get a slow clap that nobody else joins for this man?
Cop yells… “is somebody in there?!!” like what’s she supposed to say from underwater… yeah, I’m in here?!! Just wow. Talk about moving in slow motion 😩
God is testing me
Damn that cop was moving slow
Good boy brave escape but stuck leave him mom car inside? Man go help take her out, call EMT ,, man say thank boy brave,, save her.. God bless boy's mom❤❤❤
Sure seems like he's not moving very fast! Every second is crucial when underwater...
The cop pissed me off
He moved to slow
Wow
Not going to the cop was making me mad asking ia somebody in there , is she in there! YES BRO!!!! wasting time.
Wow, cop really didn't want to get wet. He didn't start moving till the other guy showed. Just yelling, " Is anyone in there?"
"Cop" didn't help it seems like. He wasted time and seemed to help reluctantly.
I hope she will be ok. What a brave son too ❤
Could that cop be any slower.
He told u she in there then u ask is somebody in there
These cops need to respond to emergencies more efficiently and stop being so clueless and questioning
ALL PRAISE AND GLORY BE TO GOD ALMIGHTY IN MY OUR HOLY LOVING AWESOME LORD AND SAVIOR YESHUA JESUS CHRIST IMMANUEL MIGHTY GLORIOUS HOLY NAME AMEN 🙏 ✝️ 🙏
Thank you for good Samaritan 👍
Stupid cop is the car unlocked
That poor lil kid..  I'm glad they were able to save his mom..
That cop took way too long..
When your so small but make big decisions too save someone you love ❤❤❤
Surprised the cop didn't ask him a million questions!
The cop really pissed me off. The little boy told him time and time again that his mother was in the car.
How is he a Good Samaritan? He's the police. He's doing his job. That's what he get paid for
What a brave boy. Doing what needed to be done even when he was clearly so scared. ❤
People that experience seizures should NEVER be behind a wheel😖
The lack of urgency by that cop. He should be a permanent desk jockey.
😢😢😮😮😮
He told you she had a seizure and was in the water!! dang you slow
This is cop taking his sweet ass time when they had just told him to somebody in there
God bless
The only time everyone like the white police man... such a shame :(
GET IN THE WATER SIR!! That baby was telling you there was someone in there!
All of the people who are making deragatory comments regarding the cop wouldn't ever have the courage and ability to heroically save this kid's mom if they were in the same situation. The lack of gratitude and respect for law enforcement these days is unreal.
I pray she made it.🙏🏾
How did the kid get out?
I don't want to be save by This cop 😢😮
Omg that's terrifying
I'm ugly crying because this is how my bil died. Noone could get to him in time and couldn't cut the seatbelt. 😢😢😢 Rih Tommy we love and miss you so dang much
Those poor kids! Their desperate cries for help for their mom is heart wrenching.
The cop didn't do.shit but take his sweet as time he should be recognized as a lazy fuck
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
If they're underwater how can they respond
I always wonder if there are men out there like me... just waiting for things like this to happen. Not around me devil. Not on my watch. I'm gonna save you. No matter what.
Did she survive???
That cop was gunna just stand there looking at the car. He asked the kid 10 times if his mom was in the car. I was wondering how she ended up in the water, but i guess she had a seizure while driving.
JESUSSS
I want to hug that boy so bad right now
GOD bless prayers up
Good samaritan? Its what hes paid to do..... Protect and serve... That like giving props to a mcdonalds worker for properly serving hundreds of people a day.... Its his job. Why is the standard so low for these pigs.
🎉🙏👍🏼
I’m curious if the boy got out on his own and if he did then I’m curious what way because they had to break a window. Were they about to resuscitate her because she def dead when they pull her out.
Everyone involved deserves a key to the city
Stupid cop
Fast thinking on the son's behalf.  He's a little  hero.  Bless them both. ❤🙏🏿❤
😢😮
🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇🙏🏾😇
That kid broke my heart, he was so scared for his mom.
The way the cop took his time was killing me, he just told you his mom was in there and he just keep asking was someone in there!!! Overall thank you, and I  thank God she’s still alive.
Praise God!!
Wow that cop didn’t rush at all 🤯
Is someone in there. Yeah hurry the fuck up.
I think it would have been quicker to hook a strap to it and pull it out.
That poor baby... he's a hero and I hope his mama is back home and in good health. 😢❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. God this is so hilarious this made my day just seeing this hopefully she didn't make it and now those kids are in foster care
It's hard watching these videos.  It always seems like they are moving to slowly.
Any body else notice how casual that cop walked over. Walked back to get something to open the car. Bro, didn't even behave as if there was any urgency. I have seen police move faster trying to tackle and beat up a man for a parking ticket, than this man was moving in an attempt to save a mothers life. 😡
Omg hope she and other got saved
Cop did a terrible job. Asking if she’s in the car when the boy clearly said she was. If it was solely up to the cop…the woman wouldn’t have made it out. He seemed scared to take action to me.
Would have been dead after all them questions
THANK GOODNESS SON & POLICE OFFICERS … HEROS!!!❤
Why is the officer moving so slow at first.  The kid is literally saying HIS MOM IS IN THERE.  Stop asking if she's in there drowning, what the f.  Get your ass in there dude.
That kid is no longer a kid. He is a man
Kid my mama's in there, please help her. Goofy cop: Is someone in there? Is she in there? WTF do you think, the panicked kid is lying.
If the cop could have taken his time any more
Cop ain’t do shit he sure took his sweet ass time
OMG!!! I just saw this on inside edition weekend an hour ago I hope and pray their mother survived and well. 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Poor baby....❤
She had a seizure while driving
THANKYOU FOR DIGGING! MAY SHE CELEBRATE GOD IN FULLNESS! JESUS IS LORD!
Thanks for the update ❤ God bless 🙏🏿
The child was great with getting help for his mother. Such a HERO!!   God Bless him and his family.🫶🏽❤️🫶🏽❤️🫶🏽❤️🫶🏽❤️🫶🏽
That cop is a lazy bastard
WOW A white guy saving a black person!
Did she survive?
GOD save that woman life.Repent from your sins all of you.JESUS CHRIST loves you all and saves Amen.
At first he wasnt exactly rushing to get in the water 🤔
Poor kid man this is so sad hope his mom is ok
Luckily she was able to be saved. I cannot understand while people who know they have seizure's would get in a car driving! It's scary that they're even allowed to get a license! Not only are they risking their own lives but also other innocent people on the road, walking or in the vehicle with them. One of my mom's friends has this issue and she's wrecked her car too and is stupidly, selfishly still out driving!! So f*** the lives of everyone else on the road, huh?! Smh
“IS sOmeBoDY iN tHeRe.”
That’s so traumatic for him to witness. If she would have died he never would have forgiven himself even though he was not at fault. Any updates on his mom and how he is
Ugh, this brought tears to my eyes. God bless this baby and his mother. 🙏🏾
I thought all cops were racist and didn’t bad people?
Bet he would act quicker if he was white
The Police officer seems to take his time to help from this clip. Does anyone else agree?
Thank god for heroic people, i hooe that kid and hus mom are okay. 😢
Take this down man.
The mainstream media never ever shows this side of police work
I hope his momma recovered. His crie is heartbreaking. I felt your pain, buddy.
That officer didn’t give a fuckk
Damn cops weren’t fast enough to save mine😢
The cop seemed like he was trying to stay dry at first then he was like fine I guess I’ll do my job and help if this kid begs me
“iS tHe cAr UnLoCkEd” Bro just go and try to open it… wasting all the time
❤🎉 Thank You SIR !!!!!!!!!
Thank you to the police officer and good Samaritan
That cop not moving fast enough ffs
Yeah kamala. Go ahead and defund the police. So lives cant be saved 🤬
😢😢😢😢 I hope and pray she's ok🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😇😇😇😇
This is Hart reaching God bless them all involved in the rescued Amen and amen ❤❤❤
Poor kid.  He did great!
That cop wasn’t too rush to rescue
How the fuck do you drive a motor vehicle into the damn pond 🤦🏾‍♂️
Cop didn't wanted to get wet
Child screaming for his mom in the car…cop says “is there someone in the car?” DUH…WTF DID HE JUST SAY??? How slow can you be? I would’ve bolted in that water without the questions!!
The fact that he was able to escape the car , swim back up , flag for help and then get the cops is amazing
Why on earth was she driving with seizer disorder? Thank God she had her brave little boy with her
I pray she survives my God 😢😢😭😭
"Is the car unlocked?" There's a faster way to find out than asking a child. I was surprised at how slowly this cop handled the situation. You tell me a woman is drowning in a submerged car, I'm running and diving into the water and going for the door handle as fast as I possibly can.
That cop was so slow! When he so the child acting so desperate he should have jumped right in the water! Instead he stands on the bank”not wanting to get wet” yelling is anybody in there… the kid is down there desperately trying to open the door! What an idiot! I pray she survived! Thanks to her child! 💕
Little Hero❤
Fake
Very touching...good job son ❤ and thank you for helping officer 😊
She had a seizure. She sunk!   Ok. Get in. The cop…..Is someone in there?  🙄 Nope.  Just love standing in the middle of a dirty lake looking at a sinking car.  This cop is a little slow.
is that cop ok he called out to a submerged vehicle after he was told the driver was having a seizure. what are you wasting time walking and yelling for
Would be a woman driver smh
Thank the Lord he sent help
Poor kids to have to do that but they will be stronger adults now and their love for their mom is bright!! Thankful they weee able to get help and you know their mom is so proud!
“Is somebody in there?” Yes dude.. How many time they have to tell you?
So she has a history of seizure (judging from the 10-12 yo knowing what an active seizure looks like) but still chose to drive n put her, her child, n the general public at risk. Real pos
❓Did everyone hear this gentleman say I’ve got a punch? This is the device to break the glass if you go into the water. It goes on your key ring. Everyone should have one.!!!!!!
My lord could the cop move any slower man, what a pos, act like your own mother was in there, Dude act like you care about life, I would’ve jumped out and jumped on the car and broke that window out in seconds
I can't imagine how scared that baby was about his mama😔
It was those pleading cries from the little boy that snatched my heart out.  He must have felt so helpless knowing his momma was in that water and he alone couldn't get her out.  I'm glad he was helped.  May his momma make a full recovery from that event.
Seizures are real,  thanks for helping her!!
That poor baby. He was so brave.
Cop super calm and act like he didn’t believe the kid , showed him trying the door and walking away then showing guy already at the car and him goin back …. Who really saved her ….. cmon
You are supposed to help her first and shot a video later kindness fest think you for your kindness God bless you
All angels dot have wings you can see ! God bless them all !
God  God God bless the man who saved his mom , my eyes are full of tears right now. Please 🙏 try your very best to save his mom. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
The cop didn’t do shit. Stop giving credit to police for bs they don’t do. Getting wet isn’t saving someone… the boy and the other man saved the mom
Glad it turned out good. Knowing she suffers from seizures, WHY was she driving❓
Wish, that everybody was saved!
This is humanity gives me hope. Thank you to the gentleman, and Bravo to the son for keeping his composure and staying strong
Cop didn’t seem very useful tbh
Effin right
Is somebody in there? Is wiiillllld
“Is there somebody in there?” 🤡
He sure did take his time getting in that water to save her.... good job though
Did the woman survive
Tha'ts a great Son 😢😢❤❤ALOVE YOU SON   MENEER THANKS 👍👍💪🫲
Why is this old men wasting time knowing that someone's inside 😡
Wow, what happened
Bro was taking his time
Could that guy move any slower?? Not the time for 50 questions. Just MOVE!!!!
First responders always there ! God bless you all !! 🙏🙏🙏
Lil man you did good buddy.... awesome job God bless you
THANK GOD FOR ORANGE COUNTY  POLICEMAN'S!  THANK GOD FOR FIRST RESPONDERS!  GOD BLESS THEM!❤❤
Awesome heros 😎❤️
Scary ass police
Dude that cop has zero hurry the fawk up….. damn man you need to get your azz moving
The pain on that little boy😢
That poor child. ❤ I hope she was okay.
Who takes their time after clearly being told there's someone having a seizure in the car that's under water
THIS IS HEART BREAKING!😮😮😮😮😮 THAT GOD HER SON KNEW WHAT TO DO!  LORD BLESS THIS MAMA AND DON!  THEY WILL ALWAYS  BE IN MY PRAYERS! I HAVE FAMILY THAT HAD SEIZURE'S, AND IT'S  NO JOKE TO SEE!😮😮😢😢😢
Water rescue my favorite thing as a firefight paramedic.
Could the cop be any slower and hesitant? Literally the person is underwater.
Idk why the cop stood around, get your ass in that water and get her!
Bro this cop is the last person I’d want help from he is so slow boy jumping into the water says a lot
Oh yall like the police now(
People who suffer from that should not be allowed to drive 💔
That people would hate a child because of his skin color… the purity of their love and innocence… why does the world of adult  lose that?
OMG son was so smart to know his mom was having a SEIZURE and tell the cop! But his cries to help her crushed my heart! 💔Hero cop, glad he was in the middle of no where!
Did the mom survive? I couldn’t imagine going through this
And the cop is taking his sweet time
Howie is 110,000% more funny than you Ethan LOL
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I'm glad help came when they.   did Praying for  family 😢❤
This sent shivers all over me. The terror in his little voice 😢😢😢
Is somebody in there 😤 Whoever that was is a fucking asshole
Help her! 😢
He was asking too many questions and was slow the kid said his mom was in the car that should have been all he needed to hear smh.
Does anyone know if a fund was set up to help the cost of medical bills and loss of income to support this brave hero while his mother recovers ? Bills and expenses add up quick and they may need help.
This useless cop. First the boys says that there's someone in there but yet he waits precious seconds and risking her life even further then instead of just bursting out the back window with his gun or the side windows with this gun he sits there trying to pull a handle open knowing that there's a pressure on the car when it's in water on or instead of trying the back windows the little boy did more to save this woman than he did. Does anybody have an update to see if his mother survived or not?
I'm glad he didn't shoot the boy...
I hate when these white country cops don’t rush. Probably cause they were black 🙄🙄they literally walk
Kid: HELP HER SHES IN THE WATER!!!   Person next to car in water: HELP HERRRR!!!!!   Cop: is she In there? x1          Is somebody in there? x1   Then continues with the rescue finally🤦
Cops annoy me. The boy was frantically telling you his mom was in the car. So èéṣe tí get to the car and ask “is there anyone in there?” What kind of asinine question is that?
This guy pissed me off. A child who just ran up to you soaking wet, saying his mom is having a seizure and she’s taken on water from crashing in a pond or small body of water. The child got back into the water he’s pulling on the doors handle and you’re just on shore asking if someone is in there and he’s telling you please help her it’s my mom. He just causally walks over and finally decides to try and help. I cut the video off because I could stand to watch it anymore. This guy needs to be hardassed and humiliated and fired. Possibly even jail time for responding so slow.
Proof cops are useless
Liam what you doing there gaggalers be crazy
I’m glad she survived! That cop was not very urgent with his “help”. “Is she in there” “is somebody in there”. No dude, that kid came running up to you and told you someone was in the car twice for the fun of it
I like how they’re calling him a good Samaritan when it’s literally his job
Even though he eventually saved her he took his absolute sweet time to go in and save her 🤬🤬🤬
Is someone in there the kid screaming my mom in there what you think this cop is not the sharpest tool in the shed 🤦🏻‍♂️
Fuck man I can’t vilify all cops..
The length of this video would indicate that this woman expired at the scene. PEACE to the young boy, his mother and the rescuers!
I literally just viewed this story 20 minutes ago with only the article and to now see this young man terrified but composed enough to get help for his momma is heartbreaking and inspiring in sync...I hope his momma makes it through to hug him for many years...stay strong young fellow 🙏
Shit it looks like ima start my morning off wit some tears. This shit hurts.
That poor little boy! He was absolutely terrified! Medical incidents while driving are terrifying. Glad everyone is ok. 🫶
Why was the cop moving so slow doe?
D I d the punch work,I thought one time was all you had to punch.
Doin his job!!!
Cop sure took his fucking time
The cop moved slow ass hell tho as the lil boy cries help my mom the cop replied is someone in there wth .. but thanks for saving her tho
You saved your mom boy good job
The cop hesistated and could have cost that woman her life. He isnt a hero.
There was no sense of urgency from that cop at all
Jesus took the wheel.
Everything he did feels like if his body cam wasn’t already on… he would’ve reacted even slower.
_"Is somebody in there?"_ he said to the woman trapped under water 🤦‍♂️
The person is drowning and he's like "are you in there?"
Thank God the cop was not Sean Grechen.  Thank you sir, you protected and served well today, and you deserve respect and to ne recogni,Ed for bravery and  saving this woman's life. Neither of them will ever forget this act of bravery and compassion ❤️
“Is somebody in there?” …what kind of dumb ass question is that Officer of the Law?
this dude taking the time to ask if someone was in the car or not after literally finding out someone is in the car... like please take your sweet ass time
Great rapid response 🙄 I’m surprised the cop didn’t ask for ID and registration. He should have been a little more responsive and active.
I literally had surgery on the day this happened to hopefully prevent seizures. This is tough, hats off to the one that has cops helping
So far, 27,000 people can't read a description
This near death experience with his mom has changed who he is as a child and as a man moving forward,,🙏🏽♥️pray God will always show them favor 🙌🏽🙌🏽
That other guy and the kid saved his mom. The cop walked in there slower than a turtle.
Good boy! You're a hero kid plain and simple!
Good job officer, he put the protect in protect and serve.
🙏🏼♥️brave boy thankfully for his strength and the officers determination to save the women. Hope everyone is safe and the mother made it through this.🙏🏼♥️
Why did the cop ask if anybody in the car???🤦🏽‍♂️
The kid tells the cop over and over again that he's mom is in there, and the the cop ask twice is she in their. Dude!!!
heroes
"She's in there. She's stuck she's having a seizure" .And your first question is, is anybody in there?
Lazy no good cop
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
he's not a "good Samaritan" hes a cop, thats his job... And the time he wasted asking stupid questions rather than just acting is kinda crazy. Kid already told you his mom is having a seizure, shes sunk... Smh..
Lord Have Mercy‼️‼️
Kid: She sunk, she's in the water!!!  Officer: Is anyone in there ? Bruhhhhhh
God bless you son, I pray your mama is ok.
He’s so slow though.
Is somebody in there? Like if somebody having a seizure is going to go yeah, I’m in here drowning!!! like the kid is freaking out about his mom having a seizure go save her
Gosh this little precious boy melts my heart💗💗💗
I never seen such a slow save.
Took that cop forever to help
Omg please  get her🙏🙏🙏
That cop is useless kid is begging to save his mom and bro is asking questions instead
💫💙
Omfg
Did she live?
THIS is why if you take cops off the street things will go from BAD TO WORSE!
Oh that poor baby. Pure terror on his face. Hope they are both holding each other tight again💙
That was the slowest rescue I've ever seen... Like come on cop, add some pep to your step, it's not like she's wielding a gun under there.
💖💙💙💙🙏🏽✝️
The slowness of that cops reaction urks me, I get you have to stay calm but also dont just stand around like if you waiting for someone else to go “no cop just watch me do it, I’ll help her” move with some type of urgency to an emergency.
That pig took too long. Bet if the kid was white he’d be more concerned.
kid: "my mom had a seziure she's stuck in the car" cop: " is she in there? is somebody in there?"  keep waisting valuable time bud👍 typical cop not believing anything until they see it smh
😢
Thank God 😢
Poor baby!! I pray his mom is ok!!😢
This Arkansas?
He is never getting grounded
The dumbass cop asking “iS SumONe een thEre?” makes me cringe so hard. There was no urgency to help get that woman out. Sickening how dumb some people are
He literally told this clown, his mom was in there 50xs and this idiot is still asking him dumb questions 🤡🤦🏾‍♂️ she could've been saved sooner if he LISTENED to the boys Cries for HELP! 🎯😐
Did she make it out alive
The love he has for his mama 😢
She was lucky.  What a nightmare
I thought the police were evil. I need to be defunded. I guess that’s debunked.
People need to drive with the side window down a bit so they can be pulled down or kicked out if an emergency like this happens. Install the window ventshades to keep rainfall from entering while window is cracked and all is good.
Gye Nyame- Only God!🙌🏽💫
Cop should of jumped in immediately not asking if shes in there every second counts
That cop seems a little too uninterested at first to help. Weird.
She shouldn’t be driving  🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
He's not a good Samaritan it's his job description. Right? But he did do a great job
That cops was slow AF
The cop was ask'n way 2 many questions..o my bad that's what they do..I'm jus say'n and smdh 😐
Bro Don't be as slow and casual as this cop
Cop really wanted to shoot him,  she basically drowned waiting for him to realize he was recording 😢 do your job
Feel so sorry for her
😢😢
😇😇😇😇😇🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏👮‍♀️👮‍♀️👏👏👏👏
Is the car unlocked? Where you not going to try anyway?
Heroes all the way around.  Thank you Officers. ❤Baby, you did a good job getting out to save your mom!
Poor boy. Save his momma
Poor baby!!!  I hope his momma was ok <3<3<3
I am so proud of him. What an amazing and intelligent young man! You can tell he was raised right and wanted to do anything he could to help his mom. God bless them!
Amen yes lord bless him and his mother and his family.
😢 This video brought tears to my eyes. I pray all went well. This little young fellow loved his mom and it shows how much he cared for her. Such a heartbreaking video but true.
Thank heavens no gators in there
Defund the who?
That cop was slow as molasses!!! All scared and timid 😅
Thanks so much for the Good you do ❤❤❤❤
Michael Scott vs gps....
Kids weak.
Good thing wasn’t in Florida  🐊
Child crying MOM desperately while pointing at sinking cat he just told you about and your gonna repeatedly ask is somebody in there ….. WILD GUESS I THINK ITS HIS MOM WHO HAD A SEIZURE 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Is someone in there 👀.... Um ya that's why he wants help. That poor child !
That kid is gonna do something great with his life. God bless him and his momma
Dumbass cop just standing there asking questions.
Really? That cop acted like he wanted the kid to lose his mom. Please, take your time. What a joke
Glad she got out with the help of the officer and others!!!❤
"Is she in there?" This cop shouldn't be a detective. That's for sure!
WOW, GOD IS SO GOOD! Thank this little boy and the officer ! ❤
GOOD SAMARITAN..THANK YOU!!!! I DON'T KNOW THE OUTCOME BUT YOU, THE LITTLE BOY, AND HIS MOTHER WILL REMAIN IN MY PRAYERS!!! 🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾
“is someone in there ?” what do u think ??
Thank the police for taking the time to listen to the terrified  son and jump into action. Working together saved his mom.
I got angry when he asked “is there someone in there?”   And his ass was slow verses hurried moving towards the vehicle.
And yet women say they don't need men 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Thank you for the update that the mom's getting better each day. Thank to the man, the officr and her son for saving her life.
hero was moving slow at first
Thank God people are willing to risk all to save a life ❤️🙏🏿🙏🏿 love at it's greatest example ❤
And God🙏🏾
He literaly told you that his mum was in there, for that minute you asking him the same question over and over again it might be already too late.. you dont ask questions you just go for it dude...
But y’all on here saying oh my god he saved her blah blah bullshit suck a fart
In Britain the cops would leave her to die..the police here have no bollocks
That white cop took so long
Anyone else notice that no black person was shot or harmed by these police. See it does happen people
Bro that cop was the least urgent I've ever seen.
Cop was goofy as hell to be honest 😂
That cop needs to learn some urgency
Thank you Lord,
Cops piss me off he desperately crying saying she’s inda car drowning and dumbass cop says is there anyone in there obviously the boy ain’t crying historically for no reason and proceeds to move slow after asking the question 3 times smh
The good samaritan already trying to get her out..her blessed sweet son..the kind cop. I hope she is alright and the young son got a hug 😢😢
Avg person can only hold breath for like 1-2 min..skip the questions
That's their actual job. It is not 'samaritan'.
Omg l felted the kids panic thinking that his mom can die thank God for the police 👮 officer and the other person
If I come across a child this desperate, asking for help because his mother is inside the car submerged in water, especially the front part of the car is submerged. I don't have time to ask someone who is probably unconscious or drowning, 'Is anyone there?' I simply jump in, like the other gentleman did, but at the same time, we can see an officer with a cool head, probably thinking for a second about how to do things right. The combination of both is more important than it seems.
And media have people believing all white cops are bad......
Thank God that everyone involved is ok❤ God is good
Yall aint crying about this act of service being filmed 😂😂😂😂
poor thing 😢
The cop didn’t exactly run into the water he yelled about three times anybody in there dude what did the kid say bro that cop was forced to be a hero he didn’t offer up no hustle
Every1 stating the obvious n the desperate pleas of the son ya cuz he young n that's his mouth who is trapped under water in a car ofcourse  he's gunna b worried tf n thank god they all were there in time to help her
Why was the LOUSY COP asking so many stupid questions..he is the ultimate JACK A**!!!!
Child explains clearly.. cop.. huh what? ... tf.. kid literally says shes having a seizure shes sunk...
Put down the goddam phone!
God bless you all❤🙏
Yall saying good policeman, he took his sweet time while someone was fighting for their life! Rather than listening to the kid say, “she sunk” he’s gonna stand near the water and ask “is anyone in there?” Bro just in the water and check yall equipment is waterproof, a humans lungs are not.
“Is somebody in there!?!?” Bro stfu and get yo ass in the water!!
The poor child! I hope everything’s okay!
This cop demonstrated the same sense of urgency as a fully fed lion when a gazelle passes by!
Somebody in there ?? what a absolute stupid question to ask in such a situation 🤦are people that stupid?
said she had a seizure and starts trying to  talk to her instead of rushing in to help right away😢
Why you saving her!?  She can't drive!  She's a hazard to other drivers on the road! 😅
Looks like he reluctantly saved her. No sense of urgency  come on man
That just touched my heart. I remember calling for help for my mom. They came but unfortunately she didn’t return. Bless this courageous kids little strong heart ❤️ 🙏🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽😢
The kid comes running up to the cop crying that his mom had a seizure. She was in the car drowning. The cop asked over and over. Is anybody in there?😮
Sending prayers…
Brave Child. Thank you to Law Enforcement. You saved a life and the life of a family
Did she survive??
I was expecting a group of strong independent women to already be in the water, saving her. After all, we dont need men. Right?
Thank you. 💙
Alright time to serve & protect. Never should of picked up Franks shift - cop
Those are StarMen
Omg! I know that he was terrified thinking that his Mama was drowning. Thank God for the people that help save her from the car.🙏💯💪🙌
Hell-'Oh,  is thar eneyone in thar ?  If thar is, cumout the car with your handsup  !  Cus I'm da law, and you Caint beat da law!
Why is noone talking bout how that kid looka like liam from shameless
Dude casually strolling around while a kid is potentially watching his mom die.. top notch police work
Anyone else think the cops respond time was way to slow
The cop made me so fucking mad talking about is anybody in there and is the car unlocked no sense of urgency and we know why thankful the little boy and that other man was there the cop needs to be a better person under pressure
THANKS TO EVERYONE INVOLVED ❤️💯
HEROES.  many. many.  BLESSINGS
How calm he stayed for that little boy. I hope she made it.
Glad the cop helped but dang he could've stepped it up. He was acting like it wasn't that big of a deal.
When you see another man in the water the second time you watch. Amazing trio!!!! Thank you all for your incredible bravery.
"Is somebody in there " wow bro wow wtf his dying mom thats stuck ina car gonna say stupidest question ever kid said his mom had a seizure and crashed into the water cops are jokes now a days the citizen actually saved her not the cop
Can we please make it so people with known epilepsy cant have deivers liscenses this is scary
Cops run to help while most run away. He ran into murky water to help. Good job officer ans good job baby boy. You both saved her life.
Where’s this cops sense of urgency? WTF someone is drowning in a sunken car and you want to stand on the bank asking questions. In situations like this, every second is precious.
What happened to Mom, did she make it, is she ok?
Cop really didnt want to get in that water 😂 he asked like 5 times if someone was in there before helping
Just, "Thank you, Jesus!!!"❤
The kids trying harder then the cop.
Calm and collective
Thank you brave yound man
GOD BLESS ✝️🫶✝️🫶🫵🫵✊✊👋🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
The kid save they life.  The fact that he ask and the lady said Help his ass gon ask again... is anybody in there.... like wtf just Help her from drowning the boy just said she having a seizure.
Team work makes the dream work. Good job you guys.
normal cop who stands there and asks questions 1st because he dont wanna get wet. YOUR WASTING TIME BUDDY!!!! GET YO AZZ IN THERE!
That broke my heart to hear him yell "My mom!" I wanna pray for their safety in Jesus name Amen ❤❤
Thank you for helping them out 😊
It seemed liked the cops reaction was hesitate.
Did this turn out well?
Thanks for getting your mom help precious kid ❤ you are her angel
Praise God. I pray she's OK. Thank you to the Officer and Samaritan who helped her. ❤
Ah… the infamous “step it up” request from PD. Do they think we just putz around on the way to calls?
That poor baby. I wish I was there to help and just give that boy the big hug he needed
Why does the officer keep asking questions? Just save the lady.
🙏
Love the cops “is the car unlocked?” (Idk maybe try the handle) And let me stand here for 5min yelling “is someone in there?” No the little kid jus came up to you crying frantically saying his mom is in there for no reason; and that car in the water is CGI. Other than that shout out to this cop for saving someone’s life.
Summary with update: It happened on July 24, 2024 in West Orange, Texas. You don't see the cop run to his cruiser to get a window breaking tool. He comes back to the car, breaks the back window when the car began to sink. He & at least 2 good samaritans were able to pull her out (a real feat in itself with a limp body submerged in a car!), where she was unconscious, not breathing, but a light pulse on her wrist. After being rescued, the mom of 2, Jonquetta Winbush, was placed on a ventilator for 3 weeks before being able to breathe on her own. At this time, she is still recovering. The cop, Charles Cobb, & the good samaritans were awarded with a life-saving award and letter of commendation on Aug. 13, 2024. *That is her 12yo son who had been in the car & escaped. Her 16yo daughter was also with her & told her brother to call for help.
That little boy is as much a hero as the cops were. Without either of them, she wouldn’t have lived. Incredible work fellas!
Wow the your time mam what's there names.  Addresses what they wearing how old are they ahh.  Ahh do they have I'd ahh.   Ahh do you have swimmy I can use
God bless lil man
Why is he still asking questions when that baby is telling him and screaming "my mom"
I'm so glad everyone was saved, but the officer asked, "Is somebody in there?" I instantly went 🤦🏾‍♂️
Is somebody in there ?
why would the cop Halo is somebody in there when the boy already trying to tell him that was just dumb like she's going to say yes I'm in here.
To serve and protect 🙏
Did she made it? Does anybody know?
Not gona lie, That COP kinda sucked at his job
Thank the Most High Creator of All that they were all in place at the right time to work together resulting in her being saved. Squad cars should be equipped with a cable or chain to attach to vehicles in emergent situations. In this particular event the distance between the two vehicles 🚗 was short enough to have pulled the vehicle from the water or prevent it from moving more into the water.
That cop frustrated me, asking is someone in there? WTF what do you think? Just seemed like he didn’t want to go to work today
man stupid questions like "is somebody there?" get me annoyed like,noo I just brought u to this empty  crashed car  for fun ,it's annoying
You heard her sir.....smh
Did she make it???...😮
Someone should have told the cop that there was a box of donuts in it for him if he moved faster.
That poor child.  God bless both mama and child.
Why was he going so slow?
At first I was like so she had a seizure and that's what made her go off the road? But then I figured if you have a medical condition of seizures you wouldn't be driving anyways. But everybody who does have seizures at some point didn't unless they were born having a seizure. So when you have your first ever seizure just hope you're not driving
Officer Chuck Cobb administered several minutes of CPR after she was pulled from the car. The city of West Orange honored Cobb and the good Samaritans on Aug. 13 with a life-saving award and letter of commendation. She is doing well and is expected to make a 100% recovery.
Dude run
Bless that kids heart!!!!!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾to the child.   Plot twist: wake up ma'am  "Can I see your drivers license and proof of registration?".
How scary! His mom is in the water having a seizure! Thank heavens she was rescued.  ❤️🤗❤️🤗❤️
Thank you God!!!!!!!!!! OMG🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽♥️♥️♥️♥️
Brave little boy
Hoooya
That was poor reaction on the officers part he was already told by the child that his mother is in there and that she’s having a seizure,  the car is underwater…. Just because he didn’t want to get wet, he stands there and asks is anyone in there? How in the hell is she going to answer if she’s underwater and she was having a seizure,  like the child said! I hope he gets the same response when he needs help!
Boy, this is an officer with no critical thinking. The back of the vehicle is above the water line and you're trying to break the windows at the water line rather than break the back window and go in.
So stupid to be asking someone who's drowning if they're in there! 😮
Cops like "whhhaattt?" Like get tf in there and help. bro asking questions like shes not drowning in a car passed out
She had a seizure… While driving she bold
Sherman
This is what the police are for.
Survival, in its rawest form, my heart, the true desperation in this baby's voice, Thankyou Father Yahuah GOD,  for sending your warriors to help these people...  I have to admit, when I saw the officer pulling on the door handle, I started getting sooo mad, I'm talking g to the video, bro stop pulling the effing handle, break a window, but then the door opens !!!! AMEN 🙏
True cops
I just have to say what a pos cop. Did the absolute minimum.
You cant drive if you have seizures unfortunately. They wont give you a license. So....
The mere fact that you have to use the term Good Samaritan cop tells you all you need to know about cops nowadays........ there is no such thing as a Good Samaritan cop that's what they pay him to do the fact that this man actually helped out tells you he's a decent person but nowadays it's a whole lot of them that wouldn't do it
It's not a good it's not a good Samaritan....it's his job to serve and protect.
I hate these hypocrite comments make the little boy came crying hysterically send his mother was stuck in the water and then the police go there and don't worry and anybody in there like he really didn't want to help. When it feels good old boy Johnny he wouldn't even ask you would have jumped his butt and then tried to save a person even if nobody was in there😢
Im just glad that shes ok
That cop is a clown the little boy is crying yelling she is in there and he stay asking that dumb ass question he didn't jump in to help until the Good citizen jumped in to  help that cop a coward
Thank goodness that Boy is a brave man now!
On this earth you good and evil and this cop is on the good side for humanity thank you to be brave and save a life 👮‍♂️  🫡 💯
Thank you Officer ❤
I woulda punched that window out
Poor baby, I hope his mom is okay
Important info. Glass is harder to break under water.
The cop was rude and yelled at the already frantic boy. I guarantee he wouldnt have yelled at the child if the child had been white.
Cops so stupid with stupid questions
Im sorry i am southern i can tell you 100 percent that cop was not planning on getting in that water to help. That is not a voice or the movement of a man seeing the urgency of life and death.
Dumb question. Is the car unlocked?
I'll never understand how certain people freak out like this and act all crazy and out of breath instead of just saving a person they look for help
ACAB
You know it's bad when your EMS and you here step it up over the radio. Peddle through the floor.
😢❤brave 💪🏾
The cop taking his sweet time
“Is there somebody in there” what.. obviously someone is in there. And way to go wasting time asking him the same question that has an obvious answer. Guess that’s why the piggy didn’t go to college
Why didn’t he just go to the car instead asking is somebody in there 3 times little boy kept saying she’s have a seizure the mother couldn’t hear him  and took his time going in the water skin color made a difference for him  I hope everyone was saved
That cop didn't care you could see it. He only helped because he had to. There was no urgency in that cops actions what so ever. Are people blind?
They just needed to pop the glass in the back which was exposed
That kid was amazingly brave and clear thinking all things considered
Wow
When you cant afford yoir kids 😂
Is she in there? He had to ask? As is she could respond? I'm glad he helped but kid screams for help and he nonchalant walked over like I'm glad it wasn't me In that car
I know they had to do CPR to remove water from her lungs. Good thing she wasn't alone. Brave little boy! My heart just melted. I don't think it's wise to drive if you suffer from epilepsy.
"is she in there?" Bruuhhh he ain't panicking for nothing
Dude took his time
Thank you for sharing the update.
❤May Jesus Bless!❤
Man, the cop sure took his sweet time getting in the water.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
God is GOOD!!❤
Put the fucking camera down and rescue the woman for christ sake. Everything is not meant to be on video
The cop is really really slow yet they choose to aim a gun at anyone but she a kid desperately crying for help n can react to the situation fast is a disappointment for cops
A mean... thank christ it did end well.. the time he took to First engage was far too long fuck sake
<3
Cop didn't seem like he wanted to or is that just me?
Glad to see the LEO and a Good Samaritan were able ro help her.  But we should defund the Police, right? 🤦🏻‍♂️
God bless  everyone involved in saving this mother. I know this child will remember this for the rest of his life!   Praise God.
Possibly same person that screamed defund the police.  What now? She going to sue because he touched her without consent to do so? Glad he saved her. Hopefully she comes out o.k.
Omg this made me cried!
Shad a seizure n drove into the pond smh poor kid glad he was able to get police officers
Why don't they have a window breaker
Oh I hope she was ok. Please this child
That's a real courageous officer, he acted before rescue was on the scene..
See this type of stuff frighten me! Her son is a hero! He will always be traumatized from this incident😢
Dear God!!!! 😢 How valuable is a himan life in need.
God please keep your healing hands using her and bless her with a full recovery. Father give the family peace and wisdom in all matters and Lord bless the police officer that was attentive to this family’s needs I’m Jesus name
Definitely a core memory
When we all help we all gets it done , peace
poor child, had to go thru it. I hope they both doing ok
People that have seizures should not drive because seizures are unpredictable and you don't know where you going to have one this is not good everybody in the car could have drowned😳😱
Saying prayers for that boy’s mama 🙏😢
Deja la camara y ayuda x favor😱😱🤬🤬
Hate to say that cop is a dumbass. Obviously an emergency but your asking stupid questions. There's a car in the water bro... go check that out stop pulling people over.
Wow 😮 oh my goodness god help them people please  the boy saved the woman life 😅😢😱😭Amen 🙏
Cop gave the Good Samaritan a punch which can break the car glass since he was already on the side where the lady was. This why someone or the driver should always carry one or a glass breaker especially these areas where there is a lot of open water off the roads.
That cop was kinda slow moving if you ask me..
Wussup with, "Is there somebody in there?"
Is someone in there??? My mom help her
🙏🙏🙏🙏
That poor lil baby. “Save my momma”!!!! 😢 God bless him and the officers.
Can we please be real for once that cop didn’t give a fuck it is all in his demeanor like please be fucking honest I strongly dislike  internet 🫠
This is the difference between a cop and a police officer. Police officers serve and protect.   Good job getting help for your mom little man.
They’re fortunate. One of my haircut customers had a seizure on her way home from work and landed in a small pond just deep enough to conceal her car. It was several years afterwards when the water receded that they found her. In Hutto, TX. It was heartbreaking.
Bless the young man and the Cop❤
I found this at the Statesman:  "Jonquetta Winbush had a seizure while driving along Highway 87 with her two children, according to Assistant Police Chief Jessie Romero. Daughter Bri-Asia, 16, and son Dwight, 12, were in the vehicle. Bri-Asia told the responding officer that she'd noticed her mother starting to have a seizure. The daughter got out of the vehicle and walked to the driver's side to put the car in park and help, but the doors had been locked."  The woman survived and told the officer who visited her at the hospital, "You are family now."
Is the car unlocked?
The Young Man was so brave  and the cop we thank U.
People get so stuck at picking at every thing… I don’t care who was where , this baby was distraught and  stoped and asked for help from anyone, well done darling ,  and I hope his mum is ok , thank you to all that people that helped ❤❤❤
Child: HELP MY MOM IS HAVING A SEIZURE!! AND DROVE INTO THE POND!! 😭  Police: Is somebody in there? 😳   Child: HELP HER!! 😫  Mom, was on ventilator but off and doing better.   - No more driving mom ❤
She's black he's gonna take his time
Sounds like the cop didn’t want to help
I’m just confused why the cop walked calmly over and was asking a basically fully submerged car if there was someone in there while the boy was loudly and persistently screaming his mom was in there unconscious. Took his sweet time.
God Bless
She seized underwater... That is not a good situation on so many levels but hey at least someone else said that she is showing improvement in the hospital
God Bless
God Bless
When cops ask dumb questions
God Bless
He said his momma was in the car like 4 times and yet he keeps asking ???
Texas has a special energy, a warm and unique vibe that feels similar to what you experience when you're praying or when your mind is clear. That energy is still alive here, and it resonates throughout the state. It's my favorite state in the U.S.
So glad to know the police were close by. Thank you Jesus
They cop slow af
Is anybody in there to a person having a seasure
God bless her son and this officer! ❤
Of course he was frightened out of his mind BUT he was clear, able give clear information and get help for his mom. He is a hero's hero!!! God bless him!!! ❤
Glad he got help
🙏♥️
My Goodness, the little boy was able to communicate the important details. Thankfully they go to her in time. Praying for her to make a complete recovery.
That poor kid. The desperation and panic is hard to watch.  He definitely will have PTSD after that event. I hope they all were okay...❤❤
Let's be thankful they all worked together.
I dislike your video. You should not be talking about other people like this. Typical Pakistani style of gossiping about people. Look towards yourself and try to improve yourself and focus on yourself alone.
This cop didn't rescue her. He stood there shouting 'is somebody in there' AFTER the kid told him she was having a seizure and was in the car. He wasted time. Thank goodness for her son and the other guy that actually did rescuse her
Officer moving slow to see a car face down in th water dummy. Asks "is somebody in there?" After the kids just told him someone was in their....go figure
😲😰😥😢🙌🏽😇😇😇👏🏽👍🏽🙂✌🏽
There is few that are heros in this world  Thank GOD for these men who risk their lives to save others
I have seizures I'm scared to drive😮
Thank God for this son who used great judgments to save his mother's life!
God Bless them All❤❤❤❤❤
Omg 😭😭😭
This kid will now want to become a police officer
😢😢😢oh mi God, thank God the rescued and the police guys are there that broke my heart too, por little kid what desesperate 😮😮
That cop standing there yelling if someone's in there needs training on his listening skills.
Dont drive if u have in medical.thank god they are good police.lucky you.
I cried watching Lord we thank you for your grace and mercy 🙏
So nerve-wracking
Why did she go in the water, I don't know, but her boy clearly didn't want to go on without her.
Sad to see😢. Thank goodness this Officer up held his duty to protect and serve. Thank you for ALL YOUR EFFORTS ❤🙏🏾.  Many blessings to the family.
After a month in ICU there will be monster re-hab 😢
😢😢😢 poor guy, he was so brave but so scared at the same time
So did the little boy jump out the car before? Or swim out the window?
Arnt you supposed to break the rear window?  And if thats not an option   the windshield?
God bless the two men that help save that woman
Hope she's alright. Cop seemed to relaxed tho!!!!
Respect
The civilian there working harder than the people paid to serve and protect. The cop didn't starts moving his ass with a purpose until he saw buddy being more productive than he.
😢😢😢😢😢 my heart cant take these typa things
The cop was really just there for cam footage.  He seems like he could give 2 shots about anyone being in jeopardy of drowning
There are heroes among us. 3 amazing examples right here.  The son for seeking assistance, the civilian for his selflessness and the officer for his service. Any one of us could be in this situation and we can only hope that there is a hero to help save us.  I pray that I may find the strength and courage to be even half as much of a hero as these 3 are.  Many wishes of much happiness and over abundance for all.
Amazing.
God Grace and Mercy
Oooo… white cop saved black woman? Don’t show it to CNN and the rest of degenerates.
Cop seemed like he didn’t want to even bother
But GOD
So sad...... I feel for this young boy. Hope it turned out fine. If someone knows, please reply
SUPER  NICE KID WITH LOTS  OF KINDNESS 🎉🎉🎉.  THANK YOU GUYS FOR SAVING  HER 🎉🎉🎉
Poor kid QnQ
That poor child the fear and worry in his voice broke my heart. I pray his Mom was ok  and revived 😢
Pretty obvious someone’s in there mate, Jesus
Yo how many times did he have to say my mom is in there for you to step it up and stop f****** asking
What kind of question is, "Is she in there? Is somebody in there?" 🙄 Dumba$$, he kept telling you, "SHE'S IN THERE, SHE SUNK!" 🤨 We don't know if he saved her or not from this...🤷🏾‍♂️
Did the cop do anything ???
There’s way too many people allowed to drive who have epilepsy.
that officer ask so patiently, “is anyone in there”? 😂/took his sweet time.
Cop didn't even rescue her. worst cop ever he was trying the door handles 😂😂....boy clearly said his mother was in the car....."SHE in there 😂😂
Cop didn’t want to get wet he waited on top as long as he could smh
God bless you guys
This cop sucks
GOD BLESSED THEM FOR ETERNITY! GOD GAVE THIS CHILD A GUARDIAN ANGEL ON EARTH! AND HE FIGHT NOT TO LOOSE HER….. 😢😢😢I PRAY TO GOD HIS MOM IS WELL AND MAY GOD OPEN ALL THE GATES OF HEAVEN FOR HIS PATH BE LIGHT UP AND BLESSED TO ACHIEVE ALL HE CAN BE IN LIFE!!!🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻THIS IS THE BEST EXPRESSION OF LOVE AND CARE HUMANITY CAN SEE. GOD IS GREAT!
dang.
Kid had to yell at the cop to help his mom
Look how this man is more intressed in making a video than saving life kept filming and using one hand to get the Mother out😮 while filming
Thank you Jesus
All the cnts who say ALL Cops Are Bad...is that really true? White cop risks his life to save black woman - not really a headline for the scum media. Good job this baby doesn't think the way you all do.
Sure glad that cop hustled. 🤦‍♂️
If it was a telsa she would have drowned. Thank GOD she wasnt in a tesla
3  feet of water and the lady couldn't open the door and walk out like her son? But no she is inside panicking and waiting 15 minutes for the car to sink, some poeple just freez and no survival skills
there's still good human beings around
My God My God!! 🙏🙏🙌
Did the copperly ask?Is somebody in there ? Did you think the kid drove the car
Cops an idiot 🤦
The cop saying, "Is anyone in there? That's wild.  He didn't want to go help.
This video sent chills up my body! Jesus Christ is real!!🙌
This  made me cry what’s happening I wanna know the whole story is women alright is the son come on tell me more info please 😢
Cop taking his sweet ass time too asking the same question over and over
Is she okay?
Omg, poor child and his mom. Thank God, for the cop and the brave son !
Most windows punches are shit, the cop was tapping lightly on windows, tap tap tap. What a joke
Scary😳poor baby, he did the right thing. Thanks to the cop for saving her❤
Thank you for helping him save his Mother! 🙏🏽
That cop had no sense of urgency, asking three times if she is in there when it's obvious there is, then he walks slowly into the water
God bless everyone ❤❤❤❤😢
The cop didn’t want to help me moving so slow he had to help because he was caught on the scene
Poor little lad, hope his mamma was OK bless him, good lad for helping save Yr mamma ✌🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤️❤️
They only show a few bad police videos to make them hate the cops but there are thousands more good videos that just don't get released. Respect
He was in no damn hurry and the kids even told him and he slowly questioning it. Way to go little man glad y'all made it.
Did he take his time to get there and ask a kid if the cars unlocked while his moms drowning
I salute this young man for moving swiftly to get help. Salute to the cop and other good Samaritan that jumped in to save this mom. I pray that she survived.
The cop ain’t do shit but keep asking is sombody in there 😊
Maybe lose the camera and help?
Why he say is someone in there and juat stand there when u can hear her n the kid is telling him
He asking stupid questions. Like someone is going to answer him from the water. The boy clearly told you his mom was in there. Ugh! 😑
cop: is there somebody in there?  omfg 😮
Why do I feel like he would have reacted faster if that was a little white girl
Heroes !!!
Glad she was saved, but the police could have showed some sense of urgency!😂
Omg so heartbreaking I hope she survived
💔🥲🥲 he was so scared for his mom
God damn some urgency
Is somebody in there? Nah dumbass, nah...
How about a little pep in your stop officer...goodness
Sorry I was textin baby daddy
She thought her charger could take the turn 😂
God bless the child, his mother and the wonderful Good Samatitan
I'm glad he knew to get help for his mom.
Cop was taking his sweet time getting to her
Michael and dwight?
What a brave young man! You go kid!
This cop already in the wrong and I’m only two seconds in… he’s like “is someone in there” from 15 feet away. Anyone else would’ve heard the kids voice and been running and jumping in.
What a great son. Your mom will be the only constant love in your life. Thank you officers
Thank God for good people ready to help! ❤
This is not the cop to call if I need help 😅
The lack of urgency is disgraceful! Clearly someone was inside because the panicked boy told us this!
"Is anyone in there?" Shouts the cop whos had a kid beg him to save her 😂
Wow!
I'm sorry but the kid told him that his mom was in the car having a seizure and the cop goes over to the edge and stands there...waiting for a response if somebody is in the car. Good for jumping into action I guess maybe in the end.
Praying the family.
Its not just the boy who is a hero. Its the cop too. Lets give them BOTH the respect and honor they both deserve!!
Please lord !! Protect this family
God bless these heroes 🙏!
Didn't exactly rush
And a soon as she comes back to life  it will be cuffs and fines.
"Is she in there" while the kid is screaming help her?     Come onnn mannnn
😮Nooooo, the person in there helped first he was tooooo calm for me at the beginning and others' videos 📹  they don't play😮😮😮😮
Who Else Thought That Was Liam, From Shameless?
What's the title of the movie 😮
Cop was slow and non shalont about it
You mean the good Samaritan made the rescue
Lol is someone in there
That cop response time was slow and why he asking if someone in the car stupid head cop. And he forgot his billy club
Doesn't  feel  like this cop feels  the urgency of the kid he is taking his  cool sweet time protect and  serve  Huh  😮😮
The slowest police ever
Dont you punch the back window?
Please everybody buy a punch they like 5 dollars than show everybody in your house how to used it and keep one in every car where you can get to it where Eva you at in the car
What An Awesome Son ❤ And Police Officer Who Saved This Young Boys Mom From Dying Gods Goodness ❤❤❤❤
This cop. Didn't really wanna help u can tell.  No rush at all
See what cops have to go thru? No wonder some turn into bad eggs. Cops, good cops need our support!
slow as fuk dude wtf do your job and hurry
I googled it. She survived. The cop administered CPR to the mother. She looked at the officer and told him they were family now. Anyone saying she died is a troll. Someone's comment that she passed away made me Google it.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Thank you to the person who helped her🎉❤God bless them.
Unbelievable! Here in the UK, you're not allowed a driving licence if you have epilepsy or any condition that causes seizures - and this is why! She could have killed an innocent by hitting them in that car! They must have known she had the condition already, as the child knew it was a seizure! Thank goodness that cop was around and I hope they took the lady's licence off of her!
.... This cop is moving way too slow jesus christ
its a mustang of course smh
Epilepsy can be very tricky I hope the woman is ok and I hope her son is ok god bless the officer and the bystander who helped her also the woman and child.
That little boy. Aaaggghh! My heart. Poor little guy. I’m glad they got his mom out. The fear on his face and desperation in his voice just broke me.
I saved people once never again. 😢 Not worth losing my life
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙌🏿
Cop was slow, and did not listen to the child. Thank God for the other man. That cop probably would have let her drown. Sad to say, he didn't seem that concerned; asking questions like the child was lying. Is somebody in there? Ignorant fool.
That poor baby. His crying tore me to pieces.
Thank you brave young man and officers and bystanders.❤️
Oh I hope they saved that baby’s momma
If only the cop actually rushed to help instead of taking his time and yelling to a car that’s completely under water.
This gave me chills 😢
Good cop.. but he doesn't deserve all the credit for this..
Why is that cop asking if the kid already told him his mom was already in the car  It seem like that cop didn’t want to get wet but did anyway to help out that kids mother
🙏🏿
the slowest reacting cop ever.
The cop is a hero, yes, albeit a reluctant one since he’s asking again after the hysterical child that told him his mom’s in the car,  “sinking”…he stops before entering the water to ask if the doors unlocked?  Kind of infuriating for me, not gonna lie.  Happy she’s alive. Her son is the real hero.
I researched this story. His 16 year old sister was able to get out as well. Mom spent 3 weeks in ICU but is now breathing on her own, and is still hospitalized recovering.
Seems to me like the cop that was filming didn't really act like he was too anxious when the little girl was yelling at her mom was in there. Kind of racist
Bro the cop just like is somone in there 👁 👁 duhhhhh the boy just said his moms in there tbh fireman and most emt workers are the only ones that’s good at saving life’s no questions asked but police and when call 911 they’ll ask a thousand questions before attempting to save somone seriously
Seem like the cop was moving so slow but it is a clip
Yeah,  good driver....
Much thanks to the Samaritan for trying to help before the cop even arrived! That is a good man and I pray that he has many blessings to come. It doesn’t take a cop to be a hero. All glory to God thank you that this boys mom made it ❤
Well, is it just me or was that policeman reluctantly doing his job?
Good Samaritan is someone who's job isn't to do this in the first place, but good on the cop for helping right away instead of waiting for backup or some bs like that.
The kid went back into the water to save his momma good for them you guys are heroes
When are yall gonna learn that chargers and challengers are some of the worst handling vehicles.
God bless that young man
If you have a seizure disorder, should you be able to drive?
So glad they got to her.. My niece and cousin have seizures so they have been restricted from driving for this very reason. It’s dangerous for them AND everyone else because their body locks up completely when they seize and both had serious wrecks from their foot being on the gas pedal and the car accelerating out of control.   One had already had her license suspended for good due to her condition so she was charged for driving but the other was warned that she would not be allowed to drive again because they were going to have to suspend her license because she seizes randomly..
They're still good people in the world!!!
Good ol racist white men.
Even after speaking with such efficiency. The dumb cop is still like is somebody in there? If it was to unsafe somebody they be moving like fast n the furious but to save somebody, take they sweet old time
Bless his heart! Thank You God!
Is anyone in there I’d be so mad I just told u she in there
That poor poor child. I was actually crying “somebody help her” 😢😢
I live in West Orange😢
Thank you young man for providing vital information to the officer and thank you officer for saving this childs  mom ,thank you for being one of the million dedicated officers out their putting life before your own safety most ponds do have  gators Just want say thank you🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💯💯💯💯
Godspeed❤❤❤🙏
The cop had no urgency! The boy was telling him "his mom was in there help her!" And he's steady walking toward the scene asking is someone in there! Cmon man!
Terrible Cop…
Sweet baby had me crying
Cop didnt do shit. S/O to the samaritan.  He just standing yelling is anyone in there the kids just told you. Michael jackson said it best " they dont really care about us"
Thank you Lord for this boy's bravery, and the police
Thank to the help ❤❤
cop has the reaction time of a turtle on weed
Move faster  🐖
I don’t understand why he is asking if aomeone is in there when the child clearly told him what happened. He wasted time. Why? Because he was scared of the water?
Tbh I’d probably be in cuffs if that was my momma n the cop was moving that slow. The first thing out his mouth is “ she’s having a seizure, n she sunk n the water” cop casually questioning the back bumper of the car sticking out the lake . The gon walk up n around slow asf.
Why was the cop not sprinting into the water? You see the emergency. Stop asking questions and move your feet!
Hats off to the young man he handled a horribly traumatic experience very well I hope his mama is okay
That child is the Good Samaritan. The cops sense of urgency annoyed me!! He took to long to get to her.
Why not police officer?  Cop is a hateful term
Oh my God Blessings to the family and the man that saved the mother
This is the stupidest Texas cop, I can't believe he's still yells out is there somebody in there? You can see a Mexican man in the water trying to pull something out....😢❤ thank God for this stranger and carrying her in his arms 🙏
This poor kid…❤
Is somebody in there he just said his mother in there dumb 🐷
These make me have love for people like these thank you mr and whom ever else helped in last but not least congratulations to that little boy ❤
i really thought he was gonna shoot up the car.
LORD JESUS CHRIST BLESS EVERYONE WHO HELP THIS PERSON.
"Is somebody in there?" When a person is fighting for his/her life. First save and later ask the question, I think that would be much better but for now good work❤ to the kid and the men out there.
That boy had done savings,  those whoes in car. They're heros. God bless them all
That kid was so awesomely brave... His mom should be proud
Thank you Jesus for Saving this Mother's life. What is Impossible with man is Possible with God, Amen
Is the door unlocked 😮
I know I'm not the only one who ponders things like this...I see so many comments from people thanking God for keeping them safe and what not but if God is all knowing and has an individual life plan for each one of his children why does he have all these horrific accidents, homicides,  suicides,  etc in plan for his children??? And to make matters worse,   as a child of God, we're supposed to follow in christ footsteps and be as christ like as we can be??? I'm a follower of God but I'm good off that,  maybe that explains why our prisons are so full,  ain't no one gonna stand in front of a judge and jury claiming God told me too lol
😢the fear in the little boys voice just broke my heart. I'm so thankful to hear their doing okay ❤ pray they heal from this traumatic experience 🙏🏾
Bless those cops!  There are still some good cops out there!  Let us not forget that!
"Is there somebody in the car?" Dude the kids scream she is in the car multiple times ffs
POOR baby... OMG!!
Is she in there is somebody in there  .. just go help 🤦🏽‍♀️
Poor little boy 😢 but thank goodness his mom was saved by these great men and the young boy who managed to get out and ask for help 🙏🙏🙏🥹❤
God bless this boy for saving his mama and thank u Lord for being able too give him the strength too call help your son so awesome amen Hallelujah thank you Jesus
OMG Baby boy!!!… You clever brave little guy!!.. You saved Mumma …🥰🥰🥰😢😢😊
❤❤❤
Did thst cop really just ask is somebody in there.
Another idiot cop
The kid ran up to him and said his mom was having a seizure she was in the car underwater. So they get to the water and the so-called Good Samaritan says is there anybody in there stood there for a second is the car unlocked he says this dude did not seem worried at all I think he's a b***h!
I have epilepsy and my daughter so brave and strong help me so many times. I can't imagine what she was going through as a kid 3 years old trying to articulate to people walking down the street that I'm having a seizure.
😢😢😢
Hate to say it but a good Samaritan is everyone who's not a cop/firefighter/soldier.  They are doing their job. A good Samaritan is someone who helps without it being his job. But that doesn't mean that this officer ain't a hero for saving lives, he definitely is. But good Samaritan is just the wrong term.
That baby's quick thinking and that Man but most of all GOD'S GRACE AND MERCY.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yupp dodge charger drivers 😂
Dude istead of yelling "is someone in there" like an incompetent person! Rush over and help save that woman's life. This boiled my blood to see this officer with nonsense of urgency. They are supposed to protect. I bet he hears an officer get shot hes running to the scene .
There are good cops out there who cares about people. Much respect to that officer
God bless this Mother and son..,,
Why do they film this?
Yes but without that man's help she would have drown.
Child crying pointing saying she sunk and cop seeing submerged car asks is she in there? Is somebody in there??? 😢 Glad they helped thank God!
Adda boy . 🙂
This cop is working my nerves, why wouldn’t you bring the punch with you when you approached the car the first time, why are you wasting time asking if it’s unlocked get the fuck in the water and enact a rescue or a recovery, do your fucking job man
Lord cover him forever 🙌🏾
God bless each one
Bro some people should not work as emergency responders If someone screaming that their mom is in there please don't ask if someone's in the car just go
Bless you and your mama's heart, baby. Thank you to guy that rescued her
That policeman take his sweet time to help her huh
The cop is definitely not in the hurry to save that woman
Asking if someone’s in there as they’re slowly drowning, what a moron
The cop was helping enough. Is somebody in there? What do you think. Thank God for the good Samaritan
*Why isn't the cop moving like someone is drowning? He didn't seem to have a care in the world...*
Why is the cop asking" is somebody in there" the kid came to you for help to get that person out of there
I keep a punch/seat belt knife combo tool in the door of my car.  If you arent conscious obviously it doesnt help so much   The glass is hard to break through & i have seen where the seat belt lock is jammed.  I pray i never need to use it on my own or anyone else. The little guy crying for his mama just about broke my heart!! ❤
Poor baby, he was terrified,  but he kept it together well enough to get extra help.. I pray his mother is ok, bless all the people for helping.❤
Sad we have to hear about white cops saving black lives in you tube. The liberal media only shows tragedy of cops killing black lives who chose to threaten cops and make it look like cops out on blacks shooting spree.
❤🙏🏼❤🙏🏼❤🙏🏼
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Remember ‘ ! “The Life You save may be your own”
wtf was with that slow ass walking to the car in the beginning…???? “Is somebody in there?” Yeah dipshit the kid said his mom was in there. Slowly walking up asking “is somebody in there” and “Is the car unlocked” with no sense of urgency is crazy
God bless the boy and the policeman and the man ✝️🙏
I bet women still pick to be in the woods with a bear 🐻
Don't post that type of video please. It is like normalize watching everything... Maybe the woman is dead  and we whatch it and pass videos like it was nothing  !
This is what a real Public Servant looks like.
Poor baby ❤️‍🩹
madam... you cant park there
Wow GOD BLESS THAT JUNG MAN ..my prayers r with them …
That little angel will probably find a way to help others having seizures one day he will be a doctor or engineer I just know it ❤bless them all
Cop taking his sweet time smh
I can't believe this a live saving ,whonare the saviors ?are they police? Fellow citizen?
What an amazing son he knew what he had to do and didn’t panic when his mum was in the water well done you saved your mum and so did the man who was already there and the police officer well done guys
I hope we hear an update. God bless them ❤
Klasse Kameraführung - Sie sehen, daß Sie nichts sehen!!!
Break my heart. God bless this Samaritan. May the Lord protect him and his family may he never lack any good things nor is children children for generations upon generations
He took his sweet ass time getting over there
Poor boy he ran to get Help for his Mom please let her be safe. Police Thank you for helping this poor Child and saving his Mom. GOD Blessed Y’all. In the Name of Jesus Christ Blessed the Police for his Service and Help. I Thank You As Well. ❤ Debora Noisette
There is only one God in heaven and God alone gave those people the strength and the willingness to help save a life. We should never take God for granted. And I'm thanking God in advance for complete healing
is anyone in there? useless cop
BELIEVE.
Nice hellcat
Thanks for the update...🙏🙏🙏
Amen
Thank you Mr Law Enforcement Officer 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Lord I pray your continual healing for this family! In Jesus name!
That cops reaction was so bad she's lucky to have survived. The kid said she's having a seizure and sinking and his first reaction isn't to jump in and help but stand there and ask multiple times if she's in the car... YES, SHE IN THE CAR, NOW DO YOUR JOB! 🤦‍♂️
How did she end up in the pond?
❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢
Oh goodness
❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢
She didn't look alive
in the full video the cop was in no rush to get to that women like man he was taking his time like a women wasnt dying like atleast act with some urgency to make it seem like you
Y it took so long for the police to get in the water
When car in water, got to move fast
DIOS SOMOS UNA CADENA DE AYUDAS .. GRACIAS ,FELIZ DE  VER AYUDAR A ESTE CHICO 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I burst into tears his cries showed he loved his mommy just couldn’t help her
Thank God’s For The Help…Lord Please Bless Them All 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Sorry but his nonchalant attitude towards the situation bothers me
Could that cop move any fuckin slower damn
I nearly drowned when I was a kid so now I have an absolute terror of water. I cried my eyes out watching this, I wish that family all the love in the world. I hope they’re all ok…
That little boy stopped you and tell you his mom needs help and you gonna ask a FK stup question, if she is in there.
“Is somebody in there?”
The cop underwater still asking is there anybody in there..the stress Just go for it the kid told u many times
Omg that boy 😢...his crys in the background totally crushed me 🙏 I hope  she pulls through
The cops asking so many dumb questions. "Is she in there" "is anyone inside the vehicle" "is the car unlocked" What will he ask for next? "Can I see your ID?" Come on man! Have some awareness of the situation. 🤦‍♂️
Praise God
Wow smart boy.😢
Praise Jesus 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Man the cop was slow
Lord please have mercy!!!
God Bless this Baby and his Momma.. I'm so happy to hear she is doing better off the Ventilator. God is good to have that officer at the right place & right time to help before drowning after seizure.
I like the fact the boy comes out wet and tells the officer his mom is in the car drowning and when the officer gets there he ask is someone in the car?😂😂😂
Why they still recording while saving someone
Cop too slow
Que angustia por el niño pidiendo ayuda! Dios permita que todos esten bien!
SAVE THESE FOLKS.AMEN
Omg,
😢❤❤👍🙊🙊🙊🙏🙏👏👏
God bless our first responders ♥️♥️♥️
Thank you LORD JESUS CHRIST ❤️ 🙏
Bruh wtf the kid repeatedly states that his mom is still in the car and the cop is gonna shout out if their is anyone in the car and casually walk up to it , stupid as cops fr
It’s amazing how strong windows are when you need to break one. But then driving down the dang highway and a pebble jumps out and hits my windshield and it shatters. Bless this child. How traumatic for this love. I pray they are okay now. ❤
Cop sure could have moved a hell of a lot faster
GOOD SAMARITAN COP ?  AN OATH TO PROTECT AN SERVE.. THATS THERE JOB.. IF THEY DONT THINK THAT THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE PAID TO DO, THEN GO FLIP BURGRRS IN A SECURE ENVIRONMENT  WHERE THEY DONT HAVE TO TAKE AN OATH
Gorgeous little boy sorry you had to go thru that but your mumma is alive praise the Lord for those people who saved ur mumma
So the cop just took his sweet time the kid spoke perfect English 👌🏽  hope she ok
Man you can hear the fear in little man’s voice that shits heartbreaking hope everything is alright.
Бить стекло под водой только в угол стекла! Иначе никак не получится разбить!!! Запомните это очень важно!
Seizures and driving license? impossible for us.
Looks like a movie scene, what a brave kid.
kids like this in gaza evrey day.
Cop was chilling…… smh
Praise God
❤ Bless this little boy, how traumatizing.  Thank you rescuers.
The boy is screaming his mom is in there and the cop is going 'hello is somebody in there?'
May GOD BLESS  her
✨❤️🙏❤️✨
🙏
1. How does one accidentally drive into a pond or bug body of water for that matter 🤔 I'll never understand it  2. The dude asking way too many questions....no time for talking just get her out ya goofball
Kudos 2 the son cop & gs. But 2 things confuse me.  1. The son was saying she was in there more then once & he still stood @ the side asking. 2. Why did they not punch out the window that was partially above the water level??? Was this a certain type of ‘punch’ 4 a particular part of the car???
*Are you people blind? The little kid told the cop over and over that his mom was in the car, and that she was having a seizure, yet the cop stands off on the bank of the pond, just yelling to someone who is obviously cannot hear you from being stuck underwater, inside of a car, and who possibly is out cold from having a seizure, saying, Anyone in there?? Come on… fr. When someone is having any type of oxygen deprivation from the brain, like when drowning, literally 1 second can mean the difference from a couple of days in the hospital and permanent life changing debilitating brain damage, even possibly causing someone to go into a permanent vegetative state…. Yes over one or two seconds. Wtf why would be not just immediately go to the car…. SMH.*
Thank you very much for your Service Sir.
😢
EMS step it up? I've seen molasses move faster than this cop.
And ya'll whine and cry about the handful of instances of bad cops to slander all cops and then run to them when you need help.  Cops deserve respect.
That cop was lazy and didn’t even want to get wet if it wasn’t for the son and other Good Samaritan I think that she would have had a different ending
Cop must've been in the vicinity
Thank you strangers you were meant to be there at that time for that young man and family. We all THANK YOU
Thanks to the kind policeman 🙏❤️ May God bless you for saving someone's life, Amen 🙏
"My Mum, Help her!" 😢 I pray no-one ever goes thru what this dear boy went thru🙏🏽
Slow motion rescue
Police rushed to that car 😂😂😂
Cop not in too much of a hurry.
Wasnt in too much of a hurry, was they,??😝
God bless him for his safe life
My God My Lord and Savior. Thank you for saving this mother. Her child was in such pain as he spoke. Thank you for all the helping hands. They were Gods Angels who he allowed to step in and assist this mom and child. I am happy to hear that mom was taken off the ventilator... God is great❤❤❤❤❤
Que tensión al ver la situación de este video, pero gracias a Dios todo salió bien.. valiente
Oh my goodness 😢😢😢.
Noble Hero God bless you oll hier❤❤❤🦁✨️🦁✨️🦁✨️🕊🔥🔥🙏🌾🙏🦋🌹🤍👑💪🫵🌟❤️👑👑👑👑🫵🌟👑👑🙏😘😘😘🌹🌹😘🫵👑❤️🔥🕊😘🙏🙏🙏🦁🦁
Thank God that's she's is doing well !
Eh I wouldn’t help knowing the “culture” she comes from. We don’t need more of them.
Thank you for sharing, hello to the young man
Bless that child and bless those angels who arrived to help❤
Thank You Jesus
I've got outrage watching this video... The little boy cried for help when they arrived the cop/police officer was like is she in there,is there anyone in there it took like 10+ second in this situation he must get in the water quicker because every second count... Am glad that they were okay hope for their quick recovery
Dear child, may you and your mamma be blessed and the cop/ police man be abundantly so too. Doing what is right and righteous!  Thank you for sharing.
Tem mais pessoas boas nesse mundo! Deus é bom demais ❤
"is somebody in there?" Bro what do you think the kid has been screaming the whole time!?
She didnt look alive to me, did she get resucitated ?
Thank God there was a cop around to help ❤❤❤
Oh that poor baby.
🥺😢 no child should have to witness this especially your mother. That police officer was slow as Fck.
This made me cry , I loss my best friend this year she had a seizure while driving down the freeway, I wish we had a better  outcome. Thank you God for keeping  this young man's mom. My friend  left 3 children  behind, being strong for them is so hard.
Could this cop have moved any slower?
The cop DID NOT save the woman the civilian did!
Good Samaritan? Ain't that his job doesn't he get paid to do this
That cop asked so many time bc he wasn't actually trying to help but, was forced into it
Ommmg so scary.
They do not get paid enough!! Back the Blue!! 💙
One dumb question, when cops jump into the water, are they doing it with their guns? I ask myself if they even work after being wet tho
“Is someone in there” well no fucking sh!t
iS sOmEbOdy In ThErE? 😵‍💫.   No, the kid is screaming for nothing..
Thank you, Lord Jesus . Thank you for these beautiful Angels. I pray his mom is alright. Please help this baby be able to sleep at night, Lord
“Is there someone in there?” no we’re just playing hide and seek. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Don't get me wrong, but in urgency to help someone, I'd never think of filming the issue... 🤷‍♀️🤔
Thank you sir. God bless yall.  Little man you are so Brave..❤❤😮😮😢😢❤❤
Is somebody in there? What’s wrong with these cops? Of course someone is in there!!!!!
😢😢😢😢I hope the mother survived.  Thanks to the desperate cry of son and Good Samaritan.  God bless!
Taking your time and asking if someone is in there after he runs up crying to you is lame.
Thank you officers for being a life saver❤❤❤❤❤ and listening to the little boy… great job
❤I  love this Cop. Come on Hop In 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙 Step it up!!!!
God bless this man!!!
Oh no did i hear him she said she was having a seizure .. thats scary being your only like 8 years old glad they made it
Kid couldn't have been more clear in the beginning that she was in there, yet the guy asked again twice.  Glad she got rescued though
I hope everybody is ok.
😢😢😢😢😮
God bless you officer and thank you son for your bravery
Thank you for saving their lives.
That poor child had to be so irritated with that cops lack of urgency.
That cop didn't act like it was an urgent situation
Well that cop sure wasn’t moving in a hurry.
Ach gottchen der kleene tut mir leid hoffe seine mama gehts gut liebe grüsse aus deutschland
I just want EVERYONE to remember this the next time someone talks crap about the Police. A HUGE Thank You Sir for saving this woman that you don't even know. I know they say they're just doing their job but kudos to you Sir❤
Lord have Mercy !!! I pray your Momma is OK baby !  Thank you to the Officer's and those that helped your  Mom!   Thank you Jesus !!!🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 💜💜💜💜
This is why if you have a seizure disorder, YOU DO NOT DRIVE!!! I gave up my license for this very reason right here! I seized one night @ 3 am coming home from the store… THANK GOD I didn’t hit anyone but hit the raised curb turning into my neighborhood … destroyed the front end of my car… if it had been 3 in the afternoon, traffic would have been full and I could have easily killed someone… that was my wake up call… I hope this is this lady's wake up call… I pray she is ok…and never gets behind the wheel of another car again!
Im happy that god also got the ypung boy out some how.. for him to be able to get help 🙏🏾✨️
Did he say she’s having a seizure? If so, then why the hell are you driving?
He's the mums hero, thank everyone that helped,  all the praises to the most high YAHUAH GOD 😮 He ls so amazing  Halleluyah.....! ❤
He is telling you that his mother is stuck in the car and she had a seizure and he stand on the grass : is somebody in there? Wtf ? You wanted for her to die ?
Yeah the kid is a hero running for help instead of standing their frozen with fear and panic smart kid ❤
How did she end up in the drink?
The child saved his mom the cop just did his job
🙏
crazy this little boy survived a crash swam out if that trap and rescue his mother what in a oscar movie happend 😮❤
Thank you police officer😮
Whise camera?
That cop talking bout is somebody in there? I swear the god these brain dead ass people
That poor child doing all he can to save his mother.
That’s a sad thing about the police not every police officer is bad. They are good ones with good hearts. God bless them all.
You never see the keyboard warriors talking about "all cops are bad" when videos like this come on. Thanks to both guys and her son.
Thank you😢
Thank God for Good people who risk their lives to save others. God bless you all❤
Intelligent kid knowing he needs to ask for help in such a difficult abd traumatic moment
Angel come in little man size to.theres a scripture in the Bible that says to entertain strangers for some have with unawares. Thank God there were no alligators in that water.
“Is somebody in there?” The kid just told you there is, dumb fuq
God bless those men for helping 🙏🏾
That cop didnt really do sh*t i eouod thank him at all. He just stood there taking his sweet time while someone was drowning. Thank god for the other bloke and her son or she wouldnt have made it.
Why he yelling is somebody in the when the car is 75 percent under water doesn’t make sense to me, you an officer right take action
I blame the dodge charger
OMG that baby screening for help for his mom, and then the rest which brought out every possible phobia, had me on edge. I read where people say he saved her, but I cant tell from this. Anyone have more detail? It also sounded like the little boy may have been injured as well.
I didn't think people who have seizures could drive?
Good Samaritan & cop & of course her son!!!!
LOOK AT GOD🙏🏾 LOOK AT GOD🙏🏾 LOOK AT GOD 🙏🏾LOOK AT GOD🙏🏾
I’m dead he said is she in there when the child already told the cop that is mom was in the car smh
"Ma'am, you can't park here..."  He probably gave her a parking ticket and left...
Wszystko super ale po co ten nagrywajacy film telefon? Duzo szybciej pomożesz bez telefonu
Thanks to everyone
This has me crying
You just can't get any dumber  can you
The hesitant response damn g
God was definitely there with him and his mom. The stranger that took time to see about him and his mom. Thanks EMTs
🙏🙏🙏🙏😇😇😇❤❤❤😂👮
😢😢poor boy. so brave
that poor kid, experiencing such a terrifying ordeal.
"OH, COME ON HOP IN." LOL HE WAS LIKE SAY NO MORE LITTLE MSN TAKE ME TO YOUR MOM...
I need to to help my mom...cop gets to the car and yells is somebody in there jump to action bro hesitation is not the key in rescue
Asking dumb questions not going to do nothing but waste more time
Kid: my mum in there help  Cop: Is anybody out there ??😂😂
Nsambi seja louvado,  Deus seja louvado
🥺😢💔
Wow, must have been a typo. I’m sure the title must have been meant to say “courageous boy saves mother’s life.”   Feel like I should mention I’m not anti-cop, but this man was maddening to watch. The way his energy lagged behind those young man’s desperate pleas…. 💔
❤❤❤
I just want to hug that little guy. He’s definitely his mom’s hero for real. I hope him and his mom live a great life. God puts hero’s in certain places at the right time
Is somebody in there? He just said there was
That young man looks terrified of losing his mom yet he finds an angel who helps his mom and it happens to be a police officer just like anyone of the responders. He will put his life on the line. Don’t you all think it’s time to thank these officers for doing the best job they can. They never know if they come home late at night, God bless you for what you did
A lot of Karen’s in here wow
The only messed up part is the kid knew she was having a seizure which means she knew she had seizures and she shouldn’t have been driving
Poor Baby.  When I heard this audio on the radio I started crying my eyes out while driving.  I'm so glad the mom is finally out of the hospital ❤
Thanks to the man who rescued her
What a brave young boy. Im glad the man listened to him. Both deserve medals ❤❤
This cop didnt give two effs about these people, he was walking like he was going out if his front door to grab the newspaper.
..is this a joke ? 🤔
The man that carried her out of the water was a civilian, not a cop. He did more than the cop did.
Si el niño no sale mano pierde la Vida su madre pero lo gue me rompe la cabeza gue todavia el guevo de police pregunta si hay gente de donde este es polimierda😅de corazon puñeta😮
..did he recue a snake ? Boy's mommy was the snake ? Understand nothing 🤔
Praying 🙏🏾 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I’m not sure if it Varies by state by I know in my state all police are required to do training which requires them to deal with situations of this manner ex: search & rescue, public service/safety, and water safety training/rescue.   So for instance as a law abiding citizen loving and supportive member of my local police department & community & also taxpayer to my state as well I would expect them to handle these situations without hesitation.   Facts:    2 seconds into video victims son states to officer that his mom sunk and is in water submerged & is in need of medical attention due to seizure that led to her being unresponsive  6 seconds into video officer asks if victims family member is in water   10 seconds into video officer yells out to body of water aloud and asks if anyone is operating or if there are any occupations in vehicle & victim states his family member is in vehicle specifically states the correlation “my mom help her”  14 seconds into video officer is in body of water with victim and asks if occupants/personal/ family members vehicle is unlocked   20 seconds into video which is 6 seconds after cop asks if vehicle is unlocked officer says “here I have a punch”   40 seconds into video which is 20 seconds after officer says “here I have a punch” officer  then proceeds to pull on vehicle handle to gain entry   45 seconds into video which is 5 seconds after cop says “here I have a punch”.  Officer states “tell EMS to step it up” which officer then continues tugging on door to gain entry    51 seconds into video which is 6 seconds after officer “tell EMS to step it up” officers Coworker /other officer on the scene rescues victim from vehicle submerged in water   Questions:   1. Why didn’t officer immediately call in backup to help asses situation as soon as victim stated the intensity of it?  2. Why didn’t officer take the victim’s statement as a credible life threatening incident and immediately respond instead of questioning victim again furthermore without assessing situation to verify evidence/ statement that was presented  3. After victim states for the 2nd time that family member/community member is in a life threatening emergency officer still continues to question victim instead of calling in backup or taking situation seriously    4. Why did officer ask underaged victim? “if family members vehicle is unlocked” after a traumatic situation why didn’t the officer immediately jump into action like the training they received taught them to do?  5. Why did officer state to victim “here I have a punch” as if they were giving victim an item to assess this manner or as if officer was depending on victim to handle situation on there own   6. Why is officer pulling on victims vehicle alone? Without backup or any type of supervision?  7. Why is officer stating that EMS needs to “step it up for victim”? Was EMS preforming at maximum efficiency?   8. Why did officer need another officer to rescue victim? after original officer had already been on the scene for a while with only 1 other officer  What are everyone else’s assumptions/assessments/thoughts?
That made me cry. Poor boy i felt the urgency. We thank God for those who helped😊
Get off ur ass n go make sure it is clear instead of asking buddy!!
Some of these comments are so ignorant.
God is good
cop sure didn’t seem in too much of a rush to get her out.
God is so wonderful, and so was the little child and the policeman, so brave. God is always on time, may not come when we want him too, but, he steps in at a needed time. 🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Was hat das Video im Internet zu suchen?!?! wtf
Cop an idiot..
El va despacio.  Sin prima , pregunta.  En vez de sumergir el cuerpo de inmediato.
😢😢😢
Good Samaritan cop sounds crazy.  Thats like saying gay lesbian.  But i get it...these days you have to make the distinction
God bless them more grace
I am SO glad she is ok. However, I am wondering if she has a diagnosed seizure disorder? I do as well, and I unequivocally DO NOT drive. If it was a first seizure or something that came out of the blue, that could not be helped. But, if she was driving while experiencing knowingly that she had a seizure disorder, that is a very very bad situation. I hope it was just a one off but you would be surprised to know how many people with uncontrolled seizures are on the road everyday. I’m glad it was a savable situation.
And all you assholes want to talk about defund the police
✝️
God bless you child and officers who saved this boy's momma. 🙏🫶💯
Oh baby boy so sorry 😢
Thank the Lord
Infinite Thanx to all people dedicated to help and pdote t truly
She unfortunately ended up passing away shortly after the incident. Being a single mom the cop adopted the kid who went on to play for the Brooklyn dodgers.
🩵🙏🥹
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
This cop didn't want to get wet
3 is a powerful number thanks Mosthigh the creator for all your help you seen for us
I hope this only shaped his view on water safety. Yes, something like this can be traumatic with how she ended up hospitalized. But I hope he doesn't think about this every time he sees a body of water. For now, maybe. But I hope he heals from this, and I hope his mom comes out of the hospital without lasting problems.
TEAM WORK 🫡
Support for mothers
AMEN
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why people who are prone to seizure are not granted drivers licenses.
Thats not far from where I live
I just felt dryness in my mouth.  Oh my God
Aww, He said "ow my foot!" Then HELP HER!!!! What a great son! His foot may have been broke but the adrenaline in him erased the initial pain but once he knew help was there, the pain came hard and fast! 😢 You can hear him screaming trying to walk when they returned to the car. Poor little fella. What a blessed young lady to have such a wonderful son!! He loves her so much! Showed lots of courage! I will keep this sweet boy and his Mom in my prayers! 🙏🙏💪
Another of gates victims I'm afraid.😢
This is ridiculous how people who are sick like this still drive around with their kids in the car! This could have ended up worse
God bless you
I know everyone else is impressed with the cop and good Samaritan who saved her more directly and I personally don't know what happened before the recording started.... That child was able to quickly and clearly tell what was going on and where. Props to that kid for holding it together and getting rescue there faster.
I had to go back to the video. I'm glad he was able to get out of the car. He is soaked. They would have been missing had he not been brave. All of them are heros will pray for her recovery.
It is not about cop or good Samaritan.. basically they are good human... Respect and love to them
Texas! Do i Need to say anything else! LONE STAR 🌟
I like this video because I hope people realize most ignorant people think they hate cops until they need one ? Then realize they're needed unless they're just to stupid to think for themselves ! Most cops are there to help you  !
Bless his heart!  Poor little guy.
Did I C A Fish Flapping Out Of Someone Hand😂
Do these people have phones glued to them?
Dam that cop has to be dum as fuck, asking stupid questions like that.
He said …. Is the car unlocked 😳😳😳😳😳
Omg I am daf for this child.
I hope she recovered fully. I thought I heard she was having a seizure. That has to have been really frightening. Praise God, the right people were in the right place at the right time.
What a precious little boy ❤🫶🏾
Cop dgaf
Cop was absolutely disgusting.. A real professional would never let a child go back in there.. Cop 👮 didn't want to get his donuts wet
Was she ok?? Why won't they tell us?? At least finish the video...😡
Poor baby! Thank you officer! What happened to them?
Im just wondering was it a random seizure or does she have epilepsy and if so, was it a break through seizure? Otherwise she shouldn't have been allowed to drive, as someone with epilepsy i cant drive as ive been having seizures for over 20 years. Where im from you need to be seizure free for a year in order to drive
That’s the type of trauma that will change that young man in ways that no young man should ever have to experience. Lifelong change. I hope she was ok.
"AMEN" HALLELUJAH, so happy they got her out, they might have to do a little bet of work on her but getting her out is a start🙏🙏
We would like the whole story!!🙏🏽🙏🏽
Useless incompetent police
Why was the car in the water? Was it intentionally?
POOR BOY. I HOPE SHE MADE IT AND DETERMINED WHY SHE WAS HAVING SEIZURES AND GOD HEAL HER.
Damn this happened in Orange, TX?..... Orange/Vidor TX is supposedly where "The Klan" lives in Texas.....nevere would think I'd see this
Humanity... still lives... 🙏🏻
Wow you all need a award 🥈 the young boy and the police man three heroes
Amazing, God bless your family.
God bless ❤❤❤❤❤
Great job, rescuers Stupid question of the day: Is the car unlocked?  ☮️🌈🤎
Poor kid. The panic set in his voice as he pleads for help 😔😔.
Good thing this was TX and not a FL pond!
Still gonna hate and blame whitey later on
🙁
I watch all these videos of people winding up and abusing police officers, then I see this. Hope those people are ashamed of themselves. This officer put himself in danger to help this lady and her boy.
"Is someone in there?" "IS the car unlocked?" Smfh, cops are some of the dumbest earthlings... No, she's just trying to get her teddy bear.. God bless that women and her kids...
Thank god that man was there, God puts angels on earth to help. Hope mum OK
All I know is if that’s Florida or New Orleans and I am not sure  I am going in after those in a body of water
My anxiety is way up to the rooftop
You know it’s someone in there he already told you that go help wtf
Tell ems step it up!!
Man, seeing that poor kid so distressed had me. I hate seeing kids in situations like this.
That cop a peice of crap smh after being told by a frantic child someone was in the water he then goes to the scene and repeat the question smh not springing into action but asking questions already answered which is taking more time.. im not sure if ppl understand but ppl past away in minutes from these situations its nothing like tv shows and movies smh
I thought anyone that has seizures wasn’t allowed to drive? 😮 Well raised kids tho
Women drive because they have to,  knowing they may have a seizure. It's desperation, but the rest of us plus her kids are at risk also. She needs someone to rely on.
Get my phone?  Really these are our public servants.  I think no I demand we do better.
Shes having a seizure.  Hello is anyone in there?!? Ems step it up? Bruh doesnt even know you cant talk while having one.
Why was the police officer so hesitant? Not saying he didn’t do his job, but it’s almost like he was saying shit I don’t want to get wet uuuugggghhh now I have to get in there.
She could’ve been dead he took ages to get to her
Good Samaritan cop? There is no such thing.
Well Done great  team work
Instead of shouting is someone inside there, and wasting time, jump in and help 😮
What's messed up is calling this cop a good Samaritan. Forget that. This is his duty as a cop, not him going out of his way.
Kid tell's the cop she sunk: The cop is someone in there:
Where is tge whole video?
Now that I am confused about is were the children in the car with the mom while she crashed into the pond and then the kids were able to get out but then the doors somehow locked behind them as they were trying to get the safety I don't know
Hey, some rich bastard outta give that boy a free scholarship 😉
All three of them were in the right place at the right time as tragic as this accident was and as for the children to endure such trauma knowing that their mama was drowning most kids would go would freak out even as the adults  would  in some circumstances freaked out and would panic but they didn't they kept at it . N the officer had the punch if it wasn't for him the window would  never gotten broken the  pedestrian was helping l by telling her  children reassuring their mama will be okay so they did what was need to save the lady.
So much dramatic s*** take her ass to jail too
HER SON SAVED HER. THATS HIM IN THE WATER TRYING TO PRY THAT DOOR OPEN AND HE DIDNT GIVE UP.
Good man if God Amen
Poor kid.
🙏🏼
He told you somebody was in there.What do you mean?Is someone in there
That man was super patient or maybe he was an old man, I really don't wanna judge, but I was thinking, why the f is he asking so many questions, just go try to save the person. DAMN!!! But im gladnhe was there and I hope she is ok 😔
Imagine not being smart enough to open a door or climb out a window 😂 natural selection if you ask me 😂😂😂
The officer sounded like he didn’t want to bother and was about 10 seconds from arresting the little boy for being hysterical. “Is she in the car?”  🤡🤡
Cop issued the mother a couple tickets because he couldn’t resist before the ambulance pulled away.
Good Samaritan? That’s what cops are here for. It’s crazy when a cop actually does something he’s suppose to do he’s called a Good Samaritan lmao
Cop took his time. Jezzz
Amen
Thank God.  I'm from across the bridge less than 20 miles and this is the first time I've heard anou this.❤
That's a great son. His love for his mother safety is awesome 😢
Thank God For Him !
This Baby was About to Have A Heart Attce😭😭😭😭🙏🏿💋🙏🏿😭🙏🏿😭😳🙏🏿😭🙏🏿💋🙏🏿💋🙏🏿😳😇🙄🐻
The son may was hurt also but he had to get help. Thank God he was there.
Thank you to the third man whotrying to save her but did not get recognition. May God Bless You, Sir
“Is somebody in there” 🌚🌚🌚🌚nope
God Angles All Ways on time Wont God Do It Bess her Son Heart  They Got Her  Out  Thak  you for Helping
😢😢😢
Les frissons me sont montés direct en voyant cet enfant apeuré pour sa maman 😢❤
Not all heroes wear capes. God bless these beautiful souls ❤
Lord have mercy 😭
Non ci credo è un falso ,si vede tutto preparato 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mom's name is Jonquetta Winbush
Even as a child I wouldve been in that water trying to save my mom.
I know what they are like, my daughter has those
Mir unverständlich, wenn echt, wie man statt zu helfen dieses angebliche Drama filmt???😮
That cop dead didn’t want to go, asking “is somebody in there?” While the car is under water is wild
She's not supposed to drive with that condition
ok were is the person with the camera to record that brave sweety
Unlock or lock the car is under water!!!!!!!!!
Praise GOD❤❤❤❤❤
If the person in the car was drowning they wouldnt be able to answer your question officer
Good Samaritan cop? Or a cop doing his job?
Useless cop!! "Is the car unlocked " take more time and not find out i guess!!
Omg!!! She should not be driving if she has seizures.. but the boy did a great job looking for help for his mum. Amazing guy who stepped up to save her!!!
HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH IN JESUS CHRIST NAME I PRAY AMEN ❤️😇🙏🏽💯✌🏽🫶🏽💋
Omg! 🥺
Thank you, father God, in Jesus name, for your grace, love, and great mercy to every single person in this world!
The cop was slow as hell.
What a brave little hero that boy is❤
The cop was taking his sweet ass time
❤❤❤
Man ... God bless all in this video!
Learn to drive for god sakes look what that poor kids has been put through
Exactly why people who have seizures are not supposed to be driving. It’s illegal. So unless this is her first time seizure, she put her and her son’s life in danger. Hopefully she’s ok
💜🙏🏽💜
It's a shame people can't afford medical care to manage their seizures.  Treating seizures is not difficult, but it's gotta be profitable in the US unfortunately.   A lot of people don't even know that they're more prone to seizures than others. Simple checkups can prevent overlooking this.  Medical care like this should be free or atleast affordable in order to prevent seizures as much as possible
I WOULDNT ask I go in and find out
Wow
❤thank all of you who saved the woman in the car.
Non siate mai contro le forze dell'ordine,loro sono sempre pronti ad aiutare......
🥰💕🥰☀️🤗😊👍
White cop saves black victim, be grateful whites aren’t racist!!!!  Thank you officers and God bless you for saving so many lives regardless of being vilified by those you save.
That cop was so slow to react in the water like he was going to grab some cakes on the table and a cool drink , just no rush at all
God Bless you 🙏❤️🍀
Boy: Help her shes having a seizure!!! Cop: hey you in there?
Sto bimbo toglie il cuore a vedere la sua disperazione
God bless you 🙏
🙏❤️
Nah tha cop a asshole tha lil man come crying u reach the car and still gonna ask if someone in there fuckin joke
The boy said repeatedly my mum is in the car. Why was the police officer saying "is there anyone in the car"😮 did he not believe he boy? So weird
One of the rare moments of cops actually doing their jobs with good intentions and no corruption. ❤
That baby got out that water and went for help! People do not be playin bout they mama!🙏🏾Praying she had/has a full recovery
🙏🏿☀️
Is someone in there? He just said there is go and look for yourself coo doesn’t think too fast
Take ya damn time asking questions while Someone is drowning
🙏🏽🙌🏾
He's sooo brave poor baby
It's a good thing the water wasn't deeper
Thank God there's someone like you around durong this incident..❤❤
Cops are to calm on all the wrong calls that require alittle more action
I don’t think the title Good Samaritan is appropriate. I think that is for a regular citizen. He is a police officer and that is his duty to serve and help the public. But that is a good thing that he was brave enough to go out there and do his job.
“Is she in there?” can we please give these protect and serve people IQ tests ffs
That officer looked like he didn’t wanna help he probably only did that cause he realized his body cam was on
Thank you policeman  God bless protect you and your family for this compassionate act
Child: MOM!!! MOM! HELP HER!!! Dumbass: Is somebody in there?
Where's the urgency from this cop?
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 Cop still took way to long to react
🙏
Who cares who saved his mom as long as she was saved thank you Lord!
Sir, you are my Hero❤❤. Young man you saved your Mama, you too are my Hero🦸‍♂️🦸🏿
I hope we aren't pretending that pick pockets dont follow every single Olympic location? They are a breeding ground for thieves no matter which country it goes to
My memories came back when i saw this boy screaming for help! i screamed like him while our appartment was burning! My brother played campfire and the fire was so fast! i ran and screamed to my parents and woke them up from early sleep  in the morning with fire fire fire ...i will never forget this horrific day !!!
Thank God , officer assist. There are professional and responsible police officers out there. Who really do protect and serve.✅🙏🏿🧡
Good Samaritan? It’s his job! He second guessed the child like he didn’t want to do it and showed to a sinking car without something to break the window thank god he assumed he would be famous 5 mins late for doing his job and got it done 🙄
Jesus
Please send out prayers
Very brave young man..prayers for them all
That cop took his time and didn’t try to save her
HE DIDNT WANNAH GET HIS PIG SSA IN THE WATER 2 HELP HIM SAVE HIS MOM.  THATS Y I DONT KNOW Y WE BE SO QUICK 2 SAVE THEY SSA... THE PERSON ALREADY IN THE WATER SAVED HIS MOM..
What happened to mother! She was unconcious I guess! Not clear!  Under water!
Bro he just told you shes in there 🤣
Asking a question wasting precious time...bad news!
💔💔💔💔💔
Please tell me she survived... 💔❤️
Poor young man! I really hope she is okay!
Cop tells kid to hop in, calmly asks questions , gets punch for window, tells EMS needs to hurry , helps get woman out......."rasist cop didn't want to help" .? WTF is wrong with people? Stop with the everything is rasist BS , playing right into the "powers that be" hands to keep us , AMERICANS DIVIDED !
I'm glad she is okay. The officer better not have given her a ticket for parking there.
I'm sure the kid says at the start,she's having a seasure? Why is she driving
How's the young boy that he is probably shooken deep 😢
Terrified son. Hero Samaritan.  Cool ans clam cop.
This visual gives me some understanding to another tragic incident. 😢
The way this cop hesitated makes me angry
Good job on getting her out all three of you, sincerely. I have to ask am I the only one wondering why he's just casually walking like he knows she's already gone when the kids is begging him to help and he says "is there anybody in there"?
I commend him for getting out to go find help for his mom add for the men that help their heroes as well but my question is how did the car wind up over there and all that water😢❤ my heart goes out to the young boy and his mother I pray that she recovers 🙏🏾
Damn 😮
😢 oh poor baby he’s so scared xx
Thank God for courageous white men!!!!!!
Does anyone know if she lived, or was it too late?? That's a long time to be in the water.
That's why it's so important to share with folks when you suffer from an ailment or illness. Help comes faster in a crisis. They'll know how to help you. Thank you God that you decided, not today for this young man.Not like this.
“Is somebody in the” 👀💀seriously officer i doing think the young man would lie about HIS MOTHER BEING IN THE CAR 😩😩🙏🏾🤎
PRAISE GOD!!! 🙏
Thank you very much sir. You're a good person. ❤
Nah shit someone’s in there 🤦
THANK YOU DEAR LORD!!! ❤
How did the car get in there?
😮 I hope 🙏 she okay. God bless you officers..😮
How did the kid get out.  I’m Confused
Oh bless that little boy’s heart. ❤ I hope they were able to save his mom.
God bless him!
❤❤
Some of yall are ridiculous. He should have just left her in there. At least then he would be dry. Yall would react exactly the same. Knowing how to swim isn't something that is required to become a police officer. When you're a cop working 12 hour shifts, and you have the opportunity not to jump into a lake, and sit in a wet uniform all day you take it. He was checking if the other person on scene had already gotten her out or if she had already escaped since the kid wasn't there for a minute. Once it was confirmed she was still in there he sprung into action not "playing with the window" like some of you have said, but attempting to break the glass, and save a life. When you wonder where all of the good cops go just remember that even the good cops out here saving lives have people in the comment section criticizing his attempts to do so from the comfort of their own home. The next cop will leave her to figure it out herself because of people like you.
That's one heck of a kid. What a horrible thing for him to experience.
Poor kid
What a stewped question from the 🐷. “Is she in there”?  Well, let’s solve this high level of intelligence scenario Mr. 🐷.  There’s a car, face down, sinking in a lake.  There’s a WET, TRAUMATIZED kid BEGGING you, to help his mom. Where da fk do you think his mom is?
That’s just heartbreaking seeing that boy go through that
That poor little boy.
Oh that poor terrified baby 😭 Mum's hero
How did he get out if they had to break windows.
The kid points straight to water from the beginning saying she's having a seizure she's IN the water And the cops asks multiple times if anyone is in there Are you kidding me
@bhumphries1360 Thank you so much and Yes,  I'm always praying and wondering the outcome, xoxo❤❤❤❤❤
Some of you guys are seriosuly stupid and it aint hard to notice. First the caption literally says "Good Samaritan, Cop" okay so stop pretending your onto something by pointing out the fact there was someone already there secondly he has to make sure hes actually at the right area so no shit he's going to ask the child again and him being all relax is to help the kid not have fking panic attack thinking his mom is going to die, the scene is already intense as it is and he knows he has to stay calm. Lastly of course he was a bit hesitant he is at least 150 pounds with 50 to 70 pounds of gear added on him if he were to just jump in there he could drown himself making the situation a lot worst than the current one
OH SWEET SWEET SWEET BABY BOY!  Breaking my heart,  Kiddo. ❤❤❤❤❤ What a brave young man! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why is that cop taking his sweet old time at the beginning???
He asked if anybody was there like the drowning lady was going to answer smdh Then pulling the handle like it's not locked. He needs to retire with his unemotional ssa!!
Just take your time mate!!!!!!!!
My mom is in the car !!! Comes to the car , is some body in there ? Wtf
That punch didn't work
That's babies cry omg I'm in tears
That poor sweet boy!
Why was the man yelling, "Is someone in there?"  Duh!!  The kid was telling him the whole time his mom was in there.  He wasted precious time doing that!!  I wish he would have just jumped in and tried saving her right away!!  Im not saying that he didn't help her, im just saying that when it's a life & death situation, don't FK around & waste precious time!!!  Im really happy she is doing well.  The child will definitely need therapy from all that trauma!!! 😢💔
This cop was just doing his job! Not a good samaritan...
That poor baby ❤
And this is why people who have seizures should NEVER hold a license!!!
😭😭😭😭😭🩵🙏🏿
This is why everyone needs a glass breaker. I just gave 1 Away to friend that moved to new Orleans hopefully he never needs to use it.
This poor child broke my heart.  I so glad he was able to speak.. Bles this family. I pray she made it.. Thank you to those eho helped her.
This little boy had all my heart .
Not sure you know what Samaritan means.
Thank you! 🙏🏼
Is the car unlocked? What a bizarre question. “No sir I locked it while my mum had a seizure”
"Defund the police!!!"... Yeah right!
God bless you Sir
I’m just so glad he didn’t lose his momma.
Thanks to the cops
Be bless
❤❤❤❤❤thank God they’re ok😊
Why fuck  are you asking , if someone is in there when the boy keeps saying his mom. Like   Be real   If the kid was a  not him you would have  not asked questions and rushed in
Somebody need to figure if ya have siezures dont drive simple
This was a collective effort on both the son and the valiant and brave cop who should be recognized for there heroic act by the media and there local city officials
`Thx's God, `bless you 😮😢😊all / boths !!!  《《《  `♡~ing laura.  》》》
He was so non chalant like oh nobody in danger of drowning after u see car halfway in water
Pas trop pressé le sauveur ! Faut se dépêcher monsieur !
Both of them saved his momma life but the cop stayed calm and took his time..that's why they didn't call the cop a hero in all the comments.
Ipray she ok
That childs cry for his momma broke my soul😢
God Bless them & the Cop❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why is the cop so relaxed?
....... is it just me or did he not move fast enough?
Dear LORD, Thank YOU 🙏🏾❤🥹
The fact that he knew she had a seizure, and that's why she went off the road, leads to ask the question, does she know she has siezures? Does she have a history of seizures? If she does, and she's driving anyway, she put herself in that water. She jeopardized the life of her son. She jeopardized the life of everyone else on the road around her. I don't see anyone asking this. Important questions to ask.
❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏
Cool cop ever❤😊
Praying for this family
Nothing to do with the color of skin. If I was there,😊 I couldn't save her because I can't swim and I am black. I have never swam in my life.🤷🏽 Good job son! Please tell Momma, never ever driving again with the seizure issues. God bless
The Office sure took his sweet time to react🤔..what a sucker 🤪
Cop went slow as balls
We all have the righteous nature...we need to use it.
Thank you Jesus
WHAT BRAVE BOY SAVING HIS MOM THAT IS SO PRECIOUS LITTLE BOY 👦 💙 🤧 💓 💗 💖
Little king 👑
That cop took his sweet ass time walking to the water and zalling as if his dog was sleep smd wake any second.
Cop should know you can't open a car door in water
Allah Blessings To All of Them 😊
Stop trying to cover up substance abuse with fake medical conditions.
Rescue would imply that someone was actually saved...
Good cop my ass. Bro was passifying him til he seen someone else already helping. Dude is sick
So sad hope that evry thing is fine God bless
That cop did not have a sense of urgency.
Is it just me or does it seem like the police officer showed very little urgency in this situation?
Cop be moving to Damm slow
So she did make it
Good work cop 🎉❤
THANK YOU ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Jesus. Thank this guy for saving her life❤❤
OMG the little boy....I want to hug him 🥺🥺
I pray to The Almighty One to heal her forever 😢😢😢😢
Wow. Good job to the kid and good job to the cop for serving and protecting 🤘🫡
I was there that day and with Gods strength and courage was able to get her out of that sinking car and back to shore.  I hate seeing all the negative comments about the officer from people that have no idea how stressful a situation like that can be. The little boy is a hero for running down a busy road flagging down cars that wouldn’t stop. The officer is a hero for stopping, getting back to the scene and ultimately performing CPR on the woman until she regained her pulse and life. The other Good Samaritan is a hero for jumping into that water and doing everything possible to help save a life.
God Bless The Wonderful Servicemen Lord
God is Amazing! He helped two people 😮 that fsy . Glorify and praise him!
Thank you Jesus for sending your Angels to help this young man and his mom.
Good kid, he called for help, he was so frightened... God bless him. This is a cop that's protecting and serving..
Poor lady ,God be with her🙏
I guess the kid wasent strong enough.
In Jesus name we pray
Is it just me or were they struggling with the side window when the back window was out the water and easier to break i hope everything turned out okay because every second counts
COP: look son, an emergency on your part doesn't constitute an emergency on my part... Slowly moseys over to te car and contemplates getting wet.
That cop didn’t do anything. The person ran into the water before the cop. that’s when he decided to go in SMH
Another good policeman and good Samaritan thank you to the almighty for keeping them all safe
Cop was moving way too slow and asking too many questions
Black Kid clearly tells the cop his mom had a seizure and was in the car.  Cop proceeds to ask "is somebody in there?" Smh.
Why did the cop take so long to
Reminds me Of a 911 call  What is your emergency  My wife fell down the stairs  Ok  sir , whats her middle name?
Thank you sir. ❤❤❤
Who ever this officer is....Thank You Sir....And is this baby ok he was brave....Jesus....Jesus..... Jesus...
God bless you young man,his mom was in the car she's gone be a super blessed woman knowing her son SAVED her! BLESS his and he'd heart and whomever helped🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🌹
Of course she's in there isn't that what the lil boy said he act like he didn't want to go.....Smh
Oh, Wow  this very scary,  bless his heart.  Thank God for the Gentleman stopping to help ❤❤
I occasionally have seizures and my kids worry so much about me having a wreck like this even though it’s been several years since I’ve had one. They are traumatized from seeing me have them
How about you stop asking questions and try to save the woman!
Is she okay???
❤   GOD is GREAT !...
That poor baby. I went through something very similar with my mother when I was younger. Thankfully we were on land. He did the same thing I did. He did a great job given the circumstances. I can't imagine having been underwater and still rushing to save my momma. Proud of him.
😢😢😢😢❤❤❤
Ohh how traumatic for him. Glad they pulled the lady out
Praise God
Ohh how traumatic for him. Glad they pulled the lady out
Omg 😱 I wouldn’t be asking if someone’s in there like that I’d grab whatever that can break a window first before rushing to get them out! At least apparently she’s fine. People need to post aftermath with the videos so people don’t need to be searching shit for hours. Let’s not traumatize the public that have a heart still.
That cop was useless 🤦‍♂️ just like their phone operators. Save my mom she sunk in the car. He says welp lets go take a look. Gets there and ask is she in there. When seconds matter Move!  Get to action
Man he heard him say his mom was in there
That poor baby 😭😭 I'm glad him and his mother are okay ❤
The cop did absolutely nothing!! Coward didn’t even get his face wet
Poor little guy and his poor mama, but I love his strength and bravery to try to save her life. I have seizures and my son used to be the same way bless his heart.😔❤
Texas cops never seem to be in too big of a hurry
Poor baby!😢
🙏🏽👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🏆🏆
Only thing cop do is be the Camera man! At least he tried 🤷🏾‍♂️😂 is the car unlocked get her up here
Am sorry, but sometimes lack of common sense is very irritating. A little boy is telling you there is someone in a sinking car, and you approach a car and start asking is someone in there, while a desperate boy is crying out, "come on" ... I apologize but I didn't sense an urgency on this helping cop ...
I’m so proud of this young man. He showed great courage in a super high stress situation. Good for you son. I hope you have a great life
😢😢😢 I hate to see kids in distress. It's breaking up. I hope people with health issues think about their kids first. He is going to need therapy  💔 😢 😭 😪 😫
Praise the Lord!
I have said for years there needs to be safty fencing along roads with water so this does not happen to anyone having medical conditions this serious. Just saying
I hope she was okay
Why doesn't this make the main stream media?!    Because it doesn't fit the agenda.
Omg God please bless everyone 🙏🏽🙏🏻
Why is he taking his time instead of just saying is she in there just listen to the kid because she can die within seconds 🏊🏃 ask questions later
Read a comment where she is alive and doing better. That’s great news to hear, poor kid, I felt so bad for him .
Jesus he was so scared for who was in the car
He's not a good samaritan. It's his duty to preserve life! He was a bit slow, too.
Defund the police, am I right? That’s sarcasm for you lefties
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Cop took his sweet ass time
I hate these videos where they leave the ending off 🙄
Thank God they were there to help ❤
God Bless you All❤
Kid just said shes in there. Slow cop is someone in there??
taken his sweet time a bit much?  is someone in there? Is the car unlocked?
Tell EMS to step it up meanwhile is someone in there is the car unlocked
As a mom this hit hard. That poor baby😢. I pray she is OK and never drive again. Get to a city with buses and trains.😢
Thank you officer❤❤❤❤
Seeing kids in that much distress hurts my heart man.. bless his sweet heart, he must've been so afraid, I know I would've been, even at 29 years old so I cannot begin to even imagine the fear going through him,, that is a very traumatic experience for a little guy, for anyone.. I'm so glad she was rescued and he gets to spend another day with his momma .. I know he is most definitely her hero.. I know my son is mine.
So did you save her life ? Or too late!
Poor, brave baby boy.  Thank God for these people who helped.
How did the Boy get out to begin with? Maybe asking him would help. Just Saying.
Its not the cop ! Its God's Grace!APTTMHĜ!
Thank God her son was able to find help
That sucks at his job. How bout a little more urgency?
Lord Giv her complete   healing , poor baby thank God she's ok & to the Hero's  God bless yall
She is Heal In Jesus mighty name Amen 🙏 😢 🙏
Not even cute or funny or smart to be driving around with a child when YOU KNOW you have a medical condition as dangerous as seizures.
Slowest rescue ever
That police has no sense of urgency shoukdnt be on the force
Where Speed and Urgency Seem Required - Unless its to Arrest Someone Everything Seems to Be Slow M-O-T-I-O-N.
What a stressful experience, thank GOD for All involved surviving that situation.
God bless them all !  ❤️
The cop saves her life, only to arrest her out of habit 😂
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Old feller didn’t wanna get wet 😅
Always keep a hammer or something that can break you out of your car in situations like this! So sorry for this child to have witness his mother in such distress! Thank you to these men!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Momma was having a seizure he said. We hope she is okay now
Why is the cop being so slow, he did a great job, but clearly YES SOMEONE IS IN THERE.
PRAISE GOD ❤❤FOR HIS GOODNESS HIS CHILDREN HE HEARD HIS CRY
“Is somebody in there”🧐  like bro what hurry up n save the lady  😑
Thank you sir, may God bless you and your family.❣️
“Good Samaritan cop?” He’s not a casual passerby. This is his job.
“Hello is anyone in there “ cops are so useless 😂when are people going to realize cops are for ticket that’s how the police and government get free money by riding around giving tickets  police=extortion
Wow!  This is heartbreaking 💔 her poor son.  Thank God for the two men that got her out of the water and helped her and her son.  What a brave young man.
Did he do the work or the child?
Did she live?.
Despite his overwhelming fear that youngster sought help for his mother, explained the situation clearly and kept insisting on immediate help for her. AMAZING for such a young boy to be so focused and deliver the necessary details to save his mother's life. I have taught cpr and ' emergency life saving' classes and this  boy was PERFECT in his performance!  VERY IMPRESSIVE!!!
You see this! This is why you don't defund the police!
Why is the cop asking dumb qustions.
Naw, there's nobody in the car officer. The child just ran to the street to get help for his health, and although you don't seen anyone else laying in the grass, etc, there's nobody in the car even though the child already said it was!
Thank god and brave child and men that saved her life hero's 🙏👍❤️🙏
Satan tried to take her out
I am so thankful...this made me cry they are both heroes
Nothing like a child's love for there mom❤️❤️❤️
That cop was slow the others helped
😢❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wtf popo no rush
HERO!!!!!😢😢😢😢😢 ❤❤❤❤❤
Love  People need God and People amen333 always
In crying
That poor baby. I can't imagine how scared he was 😞. He was so brave. I hope he gets help for the trauma. I went through this as an adult and I still struggle coping. His mom has a long recovery ahead and this event will have a significant impact on him. I hope they grow stronger and heal ❤️
People who have frequent seizures should not be able to drive
Is somebody in there??? Uhhh, yes!! The boy just told you that.  You wasting time asking questions like that. I'm happy to see you helped, though, and wasn't nasty bc they were black. Idk who like us anymore.
Please god bring this mother and son back to full health.
😢poor kid us scared to death. Thank God they found her.💙🙏
Thats a real officer
That cop took way too long. It was painful watching
Please help me hold on kid let me turn my camera on first 😂
"Is somebody in there ?"   ...komm selbst raus , meine Uniform war gestern in der Reinigung 😑
"Is somebody in there" you already fking know she is ffs
God Bless to.this little wonderful boy. He saved his momma ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yes it a good thing that boy  found that cop, he the one that jumped in that water but y’all keep saying the boy a hero well, I think there’s 2 hero’s in this story, the boy n that policeman!🏆🏆🤷🏽‍♀️
"is somebody in there? Speak up! I can't hear you, someone is making too much noise drowning! Hello?!" - this cop.
Glory to God ❤
I don’t know how the police department system works but honestly I think every officer should take swimming lessons no matter what. This kid was very brave 💙 feel so sorry for him..
HALLELUJAH!!!!🙌🏾
Sending prayers to all on this video.
Thank you Lord Jesus ❤
Naw this is staged. Cops don’t do their job
Slowest cop I've ever seen. Didn't wanna get wet probably.
That poor baby 😢 he’s terrified for his momma
Why ask questions if you hear the situation 🤷
Is anybody in the car? Come on man
Poor baby boy 😢 had to be terrifying for the lil guy.
Oh my this mustive been so traumatic
Poor little guy! He was frantically trying to get help for his mom. 😢❤
OMG!!!  THAT IS FRIGHTENING!!!!  I pray she is ok!!!
Bless this little boy he’s desperate to save his Mom . Thank goodness someone came by . 🙏🏻🙏🏻
So, did she live?
Prayers  they are doing well
Oh man this is sad she must’ve crashed after seizing wow imagine him almost drowning tryna save them both and had to think quick enough to get out to save himself and leave behind his mum
It doesn’t show that they saved her… too long under the water
Dope vibes 👑❤️💪💯🙏
the terror that little one experienced is unbelievable.
Did she drown or what don't see her
Only by the grace of God
Thank you for being there
I am so sorry for the little man,but thank God for you all, blessings going your way 🙏 🙌 ❤️ ✨️ 💖

God is good all the time 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Great Job Son! Great Job To The Rescuers! True Bravery, And Love Of Thy Neighbour 🙏
They stupid or what? The kid is crying for help and they asking if some body in there, of course stup*d, why would he be crying like that.
Every now and again, you see one of the REALLY GOOD ONES and it makes me rethink everything I have been drawn to beleive of the police??? Thankyou & God bless you officer!! 🙏 👍
🙏🏿🙏🏿
Oh this precious child is so heart breaking.
Bless everyone that help this child & his mom.✝️💯
Thank God for Earth Angel who just came in time to save the day. Blessings
Such a great day   When a stranger whisk hits life to save another  That young person gets to hug his mom again.
Why are the cops’ body cam footage always available for stuff like this, but in other cases, they “forget” to record, or the footage gets lost? Weird how that works… It’s almost like they are a corrupt and dishonest institution.
The quick thinking of that boy saved his mother. Great job!
This young man's cries, sent chills through me. Bravo to both this young boy & Police officer for saving his mom's life ❤
The cop must've had more important things to do besides saving someone's life. I get assessing the scene but damn if he didn't take his sweet time.
Poor  baby! I thought I heard him say "Ah my foot!"  He must have gotten  hurt, but didn't let that stop him. He was running on high octane adrenaline until he got help his Mom and then recognized the pain in his foot. My heart and prayers are with the little dude his Mom and family. ❤️🙏🏽❤️
dont drive
Yo, this cop is slower than a box of rocks. Smh!! All those pointless questions he’s asking when he sees the car. The boy already told u his momma in there!! Smh
That cop is an idiot. Wasting time asking questions and not jumping in and acting.
Thank u rescuers❤❤❤
That cop was too slow moving for me. The boy is soaked and desperate to save his mom. Cop was dragging his foot. Thank the Lord for the Good Samaritan.
Thank you for saving his mother ! I know it wasn’t easy, but you did it! You saved his mama!🤗
The officer was moving to slow and asking to many questions. If I seen that car in the water I would have ran to the car to check it out for myself to clear everyone is ok!!
The first question he asked  after the question was answered already the boy said my mom is having a seizure and shes stuck is she in there 😠 naww her and 2 friends are racing down the stream 😢do u realize every second counts 😮
That cop couldn't care less
Yeah, lets defund the police!
Thank God almighty 🙏!!!!!
Solche Menschen sollte es  viele Menschen Helfen . Leider ist es nur so wenn es zu spät ist .
Poor little guy! I'm glad they both are ok... God bless them both and I know she thankful that her son went get help!
Police asking stupid questions and told you she was in the water
Lord have mercy got me grabbing my chest... baby u are such a blessing to your mother 🙏🏾 for y'all
Poor baby. I pray his mama made it. ❤
That cop didn’t give a fuck
What an  idiot cop. Is someone in there. Really. How the fuck if she going to answer.
Thank you so much for helping her and that young boy May Yahusha hamashiach bless you and your family pray all is well  for and the Son
🙏🙏
😮😮😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏
As a mother of a child whose father has seizures, this is in more ways than one, grabbed my heart.
Cop was just taking his time and not jumping to action. “Is anyone in there” duh!!! “ is the car unlocked?” Duuddde go and find out there’s no time for these stupid questions. Mother, seizure, Locked in car half way under water, drenched kid that explained everything, Jesus Christ. I’m just glad that other man jumped into action God bless him. And he was like “ heere try this” 🤯
That child saved her life. They are so blessed as a family ❤ I hope she stops driving in the future 😢 how scary. So glad everyone lived and is safe now.
He definitely didn't want to get in the water... is anyone in there?...Yes my mom! Fucksakes man he already said it 100 times 🎉
God is Super Great! Bless them all Lord
Bless this cop’s heart. I don't think he's purposefully having no sense of urgency, I think the man is just stupid. Just go into the water why are you asking again and standing around? And why not grab your window buster BEFORE getting out of the car the first time?? Doors are already submerged and impossible to open…you absolutely need the window buster no other way inside. So, I think he is merely stupid as fuck. With a good heart.
Holy fk!!
Jesus that boy so brave
What a dumb ass is the car locked wtf
Looks like he didn't gave a fck
Great job little man!!  Thank all that helped.   God bless everyone
Hope she’s ok.
The cop didn’t even want to help
Horrible cop 😞
I would love to see an update to see how she is doing.
Thank God it's good people in the world
That is so sweet that they help her God Bless
That poor boy so worried about his mama. What a brave and strong kiddo. I hope he and his mom (and anyone else in the car) is okay❤️
I hope his mim had real healing no brain injuries.   and that he gets some counseling after this trauma.
That poor kid
"Is she in there? I don't want to get wet."
Poor baby
My god that poor baby 😢.  Oh my heart 😢
What a little hero... Such a brave little man. I sure hope his mama is okay
True Heroes ❤
Jesus
That cop didn't want to help. Stop being so damn in denial.
Are there alligators in that part of TX? 😲
This guy asked if the car was unlocked 😅
why was she driving
Thank y’all so much ❤❤
Am i the only one that thought this cop seemed like a dumb a$$. The kid is in a panic saying "she had a seizure, shes in the water" and he pulls up to the sunken car and says "is somebody in there"?... Really....  I got the  feeling that he helped because he had to. Not because he wanted to. The other guy that was already in the water pulled her out of the car.  The kid and the other guy are the true heros here
Thank the good Lord for these brave men who helped her get out.  And I have no doubt that Mama is so proud of her brave son who was able save himself & still have the presence of mind to run and find help for his Mama. I pray that she is okay now  & both her & son are emotionally healing too.
🙏❤️👋
We humans are a social species. We need each other. God bless us all. And god bless those good saviors
cop had zero sense of urgency
❤❤❤
Dramatic wasn’t the correct  wording
Compassion knows no color.  Come on, America!  We are better than this divisiveness!
Thanks God for her son getting help to save her life 🙏
Jesus! Dope ass cop!
THANK YOU LORD BLESSED THE SON N OFFICER TO HELP HER
😢
AIs this momma and family okay? 🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐💞💞💞🫂🫂🫂
❤❤❤❤
Police though..wth
All praises to The Sovereign One 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 ❤️❤️❤️✝️
Prayers for all and thank you sir for helping
Title should be brave boy saves his mom 👩🏽 😢
That cop moved way too slow
Thank you To all in Jesus name
Thank God there was someone there to help.
Omg that boy's heartbreak is gut wrenching!!! That poor baby!!! Great job saving mom!!!! I'm so glad she's ok!!! Sending love n prayers!!!!!!
Thank you
The cop didn’t seem to be concerned n rescue mode at first even after the kids desperate cries For help
😢
Praise Jesus! 🙏
Thank God she's ok. Thank you Jesus she's ok.
That woman knows it's illegal for her to drive with seizure disorder which her son was very familiar with the terminology for her diagnosis
Always keep a seatbelt cutter and glass breaker in your car
But CNN and all the far left media said yt cops want to *I’ll blks. Hmm doesn’t look like that here.
Thank God for the son and officer. God is a on time God.
Kamala Harris and the Democrats want to defund the police! Imagine that
🔥💜🛡️🗡️ty,jesus,hope,she is ok,ty⚔️
Well take ur swee/ fn time
Poor child broke my heart. I hope his Mom is ok.  Thank you to the man who was trying first and others who joined in
That😢 poor baby has to witness this however God is God and he was brave and was able to get help for his Mom 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 TO GOD BE THE GLORY 🙏🙏🙏❤️
Maybe there is hope for humanity. Brave young man and good men to jump to the rescue. Proud of everyone involved.
OMG, SHE CLEARLY SAID, "SHE HAD A SEIZURE, SHE SUNK. SHE'S  IN THE WATER, YOU HAVE TO RESCUE HER!!"  He's acting way too calm and casual, walking w/o much intent, acting borderline irritated.  Then he asks her if she's in there? And twice and in an irritating way the second time, as if he's saying, like, "freakn answer me!!" And waiting for a response before acting. Like, WTF???? IS SHE SUPPOSED TO RESPOND,  "YES SIR,  I AM  ABSOLUTELY DROWNING IN HERE, NEAR DEATH ACTUALLY. WOUL D YOU MIND PLEASE GIVING ME A HAND?" TO top it all off, he tries to break the windshield underwater. Like seriously, WTF???  He could have broken the glass easier from the back top part that was exposed to the air. AMAZING!!!! The Macy's pleading with him to help her mom and crying out for her. Just heartbreaking!!!
Oh poor kid😢
This broke my heart 😢I have sons this age and I have grandma seizures and it’s just us and no family… I be so afraid that they’ll experience anything like this💔I pray God protects us all🙏🏽In Jesus name, Anen
We thank God for saving their lives. It’s good to teach your children how to swim and what to do in times of emergency situations ❤❤❤. God bless the officer for showing up in time
He was terrified, but he ran to get  help, and thank God those men step up. Quick thinking he jump out on time
Took so long before they even tried to save her!!!
Omg hes freakin out..
Oh my goodness poor little fella,my heart sank from his cries, he desperately needs someone to hold him and help him thu his emotions.  Thank you officers for your help😢😢😢
Very scary and dangerous!!! But as far as I know, it’s illegal to be driving any kind of a vehicle if you’re suffering from epilepsy or the state of Texas doesn’t have that kind of a law???.
Poor kid, I hate he has to go through that, but he was so brave. I’m glad they were able to get his mother out in time
Kid and random stranger 🫡   Oh and cop
Cops reacting wayyyyyy toooooo slow.
There were 3 helpers but we can't forget God was there too 🙏🏾
That poor kid.
That boy’s a hero!! Thank God that Good Samaritan was there!!  But the cop pissed me off being slow to HELP RESCUE THIS WOMAN!! 🤬Thank God the woman survived thanks to ALL 3! 🙏🏿
BLESS this people who saved people in sinking car. Jv/❤ TEXAS
That kid was very clear and they didn’t believe him
this cop would have let this lady drown… reminds me of those terrible 911 call center people who try to get the most useless info out of someone who’s in a panic because of a real emergency. what a disgrace.
I wish they taught what to do in these situations, what with equalizing pressure/hidden dangers of just diving in trying to do something. You can accidentally waste a lot of time trying to figure out what to do.
Pig movie slow af asking stupid questions
THE COP WAS DEADSET DRAGGING IT OUT ... ASKING DIMB QUESTION
Without looking him up, who can guess what this cop looks like?
Hero❤
The worst rescue ever 😢
Aww her poor son will never forget the feeling of feeling helpless in a situation he had no control over.. the trauma that poor poor will suffer from what he witnessed. He was completely devastated and in shock but was still doing all he knew to do to get his momma help. I hope the mom fully recovers. Does anyone know when this happened?
Thank you for your service
And the first responders!!
I imagine the cop would be moving faster
Different race won't acknowledge this tho js
Kudos to the Boy and Cop
This boy, 😭
🙏
Defund the police.
Go😅BLESS THAT CHILD ❤❤
Dam good cops, the little youngster, is a great soul…. Many blessings to all that took life serious for that woman….. peace
This is why I feel that some ppl are purely stupid!! If u know that u have seizures, then don’t freaking drive!!!!! Idc how much meds you take. Meds are not a guarantee! You risk the life of other travelers by operating a 3ton vehicle knowing good and well that at anytime, you can have a seizure attack. Ive seen so many innocent ppl severely injured or killed because some dumb seizure or diabetic patient decided to be selfish and stubborn and got behind the wheel of a vehicle and crashed into other ppl or while they had innocent passengers with them. Just stupid and don’t deserve respect!
That poor boy and his mother. ❤
You got seizures you dont drive. all other countrys its illegal to have a license if you have this tipe of medical conditions
PLAYING
Does anyone else notice that this overweight cop is moving slower than the speed of smell..... Like where is his sense of urgency?
For anyone that doesn’t know… you’re suppose to go to the back window to break and remove someone unless the vehicle is fully submersed.
Idk how that Lil boy got outa the car but he saved his mama's life ❤
Did hear alot of urgency in the mans voice but they got her out. Hope shes ok
my cousin had a seizure in the shower and her son, i forget how old he was, somehow was able to answer the phone (his grandmas was calling) and she noticed something was very wrong as obviously my cousin wasnt able to talk, she hit her head and her brain swelled and she was supposed to be paralyzed from the left side or worse neck down, she recovered not fully she still cant mover her left arm on her own bt thats the only thing wrong, if her son never answered that phone she would’ve died, to add to the story during all these procedures and surgeries and recovery they found she was pregnant she gave birth to a fully healthy baby and they are both older great young men end of story thanks for listening
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
That boy is the hero!
Such a brave young man. ❤❤❤❤❤
Bruh stop asking questions and jump the f in there and help her, the kids should be enough reason for you to stop questioning and be the help they needed especially the mother.
The baby bouta make me cry 🥹
I've always thought that police body cameras should be located from a head held device. Most, can't be properly reviewed, without the view being obscured from the policemans arms, or hands.
This is no cop
That officer had the swiftness of a potato.
God bless and protect our men and women in blue. And God bless this child who helped save his momma. ✝️❤️
And Kamala wants to defund the Police.
God bless.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
08/16/24: After 3 weeks in intensive carenJonquetta Winbush's is now breathing on her own. She’s still in the hospital, but she’s going to make a full recovery.  Blessings to her brave 12 year old son, the two workers  Epifanio Munguia (& idk) & the patrolman Charles Cobb!
Hurry up fam
Awesome job by the officer and good Samaritan. Her son was definitely a hero.❤
I'm happy her son was able to get help and I pray his mother pulls through
How is he a Good Samaritan this is almost a laughable statement
Thank you father for saving this Lady and her brave hero son 😊
God Almighty thank and praise you for her son and the people who help
Is somebody in there? I wouldn’t want to trust my life to this slow acting entitled man. The little girl is literally telling him theirs someone their that needs help. And the fact the little girl is African American he feels the life of the person in trouble is not worth risking himself at a moments notice. 😡 😡 their racism is showing
Why dont these rual cops  have SUVs with wench????????
🫶🏼🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🫶🏼
I'm sorry but it looked like the cop didnt  want to help at first.
how did this guy have time to film everything at the same time?.....filming would be the last thing on my mind in a situation like that?........
You are an example to other police officers
This is heartfelt am in tears I do hope and pray 🙏 mom had a great recovery bless this child and cover there situation 🙏🙏🙏
Thank God for their rescue!
His mom died
Cop hella slow
“Good Samaritan” cop ? WHAT???? 😩
Way to go guys...
For the cop to say, is there somebody in there is unbelievable . The child isn't getting help for naught. It sounds like the little boy had to go back in the water to help his mom.
So did the cops do that girl?
How is he going to ask if anyone is in there?! Yeah she can just scream under water! WTF!
Oh that poor baby. Lord give that young man a big hug. Cover him God. I pray for his strength, & both of their healing.
Thank you, God, for sending your angels to help this woman and her child.
Am I the only one erked by the cop's dumb questions? The boy gave more than emough info to get him going immediately!
My sweet boy! The fear in his eyes 😫😫😫😫 I just want to hold him tight. I hope the mom is doing well! He’s a hero too!!! ❤
You can't help yourself if you're unconcious. Her son saved her life. The officer seemed to take more time than was necessary to me.  I too gave up my driving when I became traumatized after being broadsided. It's hard to do, but, it could save several lives...😊
I’m crying, baby boy take a deep breath you did a very great job for your mom and May God  Bless you and your family ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤coming from Chicago Illinois
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
The cop wasnt even hurring to help she could of die
IQ test, open the back doors or the front?
My take on this is, the cop was taking his sweet time and standing at shore line asking is anyone is in there....Aside from having been trained to respond as fast as an athlete to save a life, he acted in a sloppy perverse way.  No compassion and completely stonewalled for the worst trauma a kid could  experience. So beyond disappointing. I want cops to be very athletically fit and especially emotionally fit and excellently trained in .multitude of procedures and psychology. There's enough local money if you can stop the politicians from diverting taxpayers money  into building personal wealth,  influence and power.
Fun fact to break a window faster even underwater you know those little circuits underneath your dashboard in the older cars you break it open and you tap it against the glass and the glass will shatter I forget what they're called it's been a long time what you have to take them apart and use the other side of it and bring it and it will break a window and literally shatter it in complete silence is the easiest way to break into a suspect's car or somebody you're trying to save like that you could have already been in the car that's what it's called it's called a fuse you take a fuse take the fuse and you break the plastic piece off of it and you tap it against the window the window will break
Now THATS an Officer
👑💯👑🔥⚡🔥⚡🔥🙌🙌
White people taking care of everyone else.... Weird
Cops moving too slow for someone to be in a sunken car having a seizure
What caused her to go In the water????
Did she survive?
Props to that good Samaritan, that officer didn't do shh..
Coward
Praise God thank you Jesus
Both are heros
That poor baby. Im crying for him every second feels like an eternity.
He help. I hope. His. Mom. Is. OK. I pray. For. Them.
G9d Bless them
Omg thank God they responded fast😮😢😢😢😢😢
She is his entire worldI  I pray this child heals from the trauma he endured through this ordeal.
For one! How are you going to ask is there someone in there after a child runs up, barely able to speak repeatedly saying my moms in there. A frantic child plus, a car under water should equal what?? 🙄 🤦🏽‍♀️ this is so weird to me.
Poor sweet baby! What courage! What fortitude! He's a hero!
Did she live??
Why the camera gotta be part of the rescue?
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Cop took his sweet @$$ time
Precious boy. He saved his mum. God Bless Him
Boy ‘’My mama is in there’’ cop ‘’ is some one in there’’ boy ‘’ my mama’’
That coo had no sense of urgency
I wonder if the cop gave her a ticket he sounds a little bit like that type
Poor boy. The fear in his voice was heartbreaking.
Do they allways carry under water cameras  or is this a act.
Good boy you did well son ❤
Mopar people
Elle est où la caméra sur le front ou quoi il filme même dans l’eau
Thank God he saved her
Thank you Jesus for saving her and her kids
Sirl thank you so much your a true Angel Amen
God bless the young boy, the police officer, and all who helped the woman.
Cop moving too Slow for Me!!!😢😢😮😮😮
Just wondering why you would have a camera at the ready.
Amazing rescue  ❤️ 👏 🙌 ♥️ 💖 💕 ❤️ 👏 🙌 ♥️ 💖 💕 ❤️ 👏 🙌 ♥️ 💖 to saves  the life of the lady 🙏 😢 😄 😊 😀 😞 🙏 😢 😄 😊 little boy is so brave 😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So brave mommy's hero
True. HEROS
That cop took his sweet ass time like fr bro how u gunna.walk that slow amd act like it's no.big deal
Oh that poor baby. He had to be so afraid. I hope they are ok.
Lord look at him he crying out for his mom. God let your will be done
Is anybody in there what time did you go in there when will you be back do you want me to go get something to eat first push on the brake
God please 🙏
That kids vocabulary and articulation though. That’s a good momma
Oh my God help him and his family
Jesus
Did she make it?
God’s Grace ✝️💞
Godbless you all.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Poor kid!!!
That poor baby. It breaks my heart...
Thank you police officer and thank you Jesus.
Peace and Blessings to everyone involved for saving this lil boys Mom🙏🏽 prayers for healing ❤️‍🩹
God will remember this when it’s time to meet him!
No one talking about the cop cause those comments got deleted okay
Shallow water.....nobody would have drowned
Those cops weee moving waaaay to slow and being WAAAAY TO CALM SMH
You have no problem shooting your guns any other time.  But you can’t shoot the windows?
Yes, he clearly said "She's having a seizure she sunk, She's in the water help her!! What a brave child. He was so strong to articulate all of that clearly in the midst of crying. He will do great things in this world.
Police are pathetic tellijg the boy to step back like he a threat to the cops safety to his mom drowning, he was going in cause this cop shouldn't even be trusted with a gun 😮
I’ve had the exact same thing happen to me . With my father . He had a seizure and the car went under with my littler sister she was strapped on I swam out the window and went and got help at 7 in the bonnet Carrie spillway
Imagine trying to take credit for someone elses rescue when he decided the kid was lying, police body cams should never have cuts in it
Bless everyone who helped.
Poor baby 😢 I hope she’s ok. We need a follow up.
That cop an idiot,  "is there anyone in there? Really.....time is too important for dumb questions.
Cops can do some great things its just they do so many criminal things that they get away with because of the badge and policies that arent law
Pathetic how long it took that man to get in the water to save that woman!
To all of you people bashing that police man, you need to find the FULL clip and then be thanking him just as the family was that day. This country is so divided and full of so much hate and people just being so critical of situations they are not even involved in that it’s just so sad at this point. That cop that y’all are bashing on, did CPR on the mother after the Samaritan pulled her out and saved her life when she had no pulse. Please please please think before you speak and try to keep race out of every single situation known to man. To that family, the person who just so happened to be driving by and that cop who just so happened to be driving by when the son flagged him down is forever grateful for them, as they should be. Have a blessed day ❤❤
God bless them❤
Wow the cop stands at the bank and says is anyone in there when the little boy is telling him there is.   He should have ran in that water to help   What a shame
The cry...he said help my mama😢
😊
I feel for the small minority of good cops that carry the burden of the ever increasing cronies.
Poor baby was so scared 😢
That Liam from shameless
PRAISE THE GOOD LORD GOD ALMIGHTY!!!!!🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I pray for her a perfect recovery!!!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
My heart goes out to him!!❤❤
It is illegal to drive with a seizure disorder... This a perfect example why!
Thank GOD FOR HUMAN HEROES  GOD’S ANGELS ON EARTH ❤❤❤
That was some fast reaction from the cop.
And why is she driving?
That was a dumb question for the cop to ask is the car unlocked 🤦‍♀️ and if it wasn’t it’s your duty to still save the person inside. And it was annoying he asked “is somebody in there?” Like dude the child is having a panic attack and he just said SHES in there!! 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Dude askin dumb ass question after the boy told him the lady was in there. If it weren’t for the Samaritan it may have ended differently.
Is it just me or was the guy slow af?!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
So,thé other man films instead of helping
That poor boy. Hope they able to save his Mama.
He just told you she’s in there why are you asking a person under water having a seizure anything
Props to that kid.. dude gave all the info in under 5 seconds..  thank god he had a real one waiting to help out.
His panic was heart breaking. I’m glad they were able to get her out and save her life for her son.
That lil man and his family is truly there mom little super hero’s and there moms true soul savior’s GOD BLESS THEM ANGELS 😇 😇🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️
Little hero💛thank God mom is ok🙏🏾
Is the car unlocked? GET IN THERE!!! FFS...
Thank goodness everything turned out for the best 🙏
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This poor child has me in tears. The panic is his voice sent chills up my back. I hope his mom is ok
That baby got out of the car and ran to get help for his mother. Thank you young man you did a great job ❤
The officers urgency certainly was lacking here. How do you take the kid to where he said his mother is drowning in the car and asks is someone in there? That little boy was terrified and frustrated telling that officer to help her.  Thank goodness they got her out in time. Such a smart, loving little boy.
He's so brave so much desperation to make sure his momma is saved🥺❤❤❤❤
That poor boy was so scared God bless him and his mom 🙏♥️🙏♥️
Is anybody in there just took me out like what you mean is somebody in there the boy said she’s having a seizure she sunk how can she respond 😢😒 if it was just the lil boy there he would’ve let that women die ! 😢
Police sense of urgency was non existence
Wow God bless angels...
🙏🏽 for the kid. Did she live?
Thanks to Everyone
Wow. Hope she bounce back
Thank God ❤
Poor little boy he was so frightened.. trying to get help for his mom.. thank you for the man that saved her.. is she okay?
Yelling is somebody in there was so pointless he just said his mama was in the car! Did he look like her was joking??
AMEN ❤❤❤❤
Cop was slow as hell
That cop is slowly spoking
Oh my heart. I could feel this little boys urgency! God bless all of them.
Cops pretty damned "casual" about the situation.
🙏🏽
Prayers
Looks like to me the Good Samaritan saved her the cop was just throwing around the car
How can you not cry, poor baby boy, he was so scared that his mom was going to drown he could barely get his words out, my heart goes out to him.
Oh praise God
Thank you to all of you for your compassion to take care of another. It really is heartwarming to see things like this. It makes me believe that there still are good people in this world. It hasn’t totally turned yet.
Is there somebody in there lol
I wonder how the boy got out but the doors were locked/ windows shut. Or did I miss that?  Poor precious boy. That’s trauma. I hope she makes a full recovery for his sake and hers.
The poor child is going to be be traumatized for a long, long time to come. I hope that he gets some help. God bless them all.❤🙏🏾
💐💜🙏🏾
😢 That poor kid
They revived her with chest compressions until EMS arrived and took over life saving measures. She was in the ICU for 3 weeks and is now breathing on her own in hospital. Her sister said she iis expected to make a full recovery. Her 16 year old daughter and 8 year old son managed to get out of the car while she was having a seizure, she then lost consciousness and her foot rested on the gas pedal, driving her into the water. The two good samaritans were workers at a nearby plant and assisted in removing her from the vehicle and onto the bank, along with the officer.
THANK GOD, PRAISE GOD FOR JESUS- GOD BLESS HIS SOUL- WHY IS HE ASKING IS SOMEBKDY IN THERE?- HE KNOW SOMEBODY IN THERE- J E S U S
Nice work officer❤
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Why is he walking all casually  is there anybody in there, stupid
Black people really need to learn how to swim
Gosh it must have been so traumatic to be too small to do anything except get out and get help. He kept it together though and his actions probably saved his mom’s life. Thank god it was shallow enough for them to reach.
The man with the cameras asking if somebody in there? It’s like what the hell do you think the kid drove the car himself into the water asking for help for his mom? What a stupid question.
I’m still trying to figure out why this cop is questioning the situation and not getting in there…Does it seem like no one is in there?
Man cop wasn't much help at all
❤❤❤
News stations barely give this video any play!
The poor boy. He was so scared, but he got the help he needed
I don't understand why ask if someone in there.... just go in bro...wtf. ...I'm glad the cop help but those precious seconds of asking that dumbass question matter...
“IS ANYBODY IN THERE?”  Dude… are you serious.
Kamala be like these people are racist and should be arrested for hitting her car
Thank the Lorb,For her Dear Son and the two gentlemen that were able to rescue this women!Amen. Lord please continue to help this family.❤🕊️
Gods mercy unduret FOREVER.
That cop is weak.. like the majority of them
Lord Have Mercy
I hope his mom is ok
May God Bless the little boy brave kid his mom cop and everyone else involved
He done a great job bless his little heart ❤️ ❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
"Is there somebody in there?" Bro are you deaf? The kid told you exactly what the situation was.
The cop didn't seem as concerned as I thought one would be in that type of situation. Seemed like an inconvenience to him.
Cop had no sense of urgency! Smh the other bystander cared more to save her!
God Heal Their Soul In Jesus Name Amen 🙏
Not good 😮
Pobre niño el bb x Dios gracias a Dios  están bien k trauma 🙏
He hesitates at first like he didn’t believe the kid….
Why tf did the cop just walk there like that? No rush or urgency at all!
Praise God
Kid screaming she's in there to help and the cop "is someone  in there" taking his sweet time
Prayers are sent
Que Deus abençoe a TDS os envolvidos na situação de salvamento da senhora!🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Cop wasting time
😢😢😢
This is sad. Why doesnt the cop call for more help. He calls to the car. They are in the water. They need to get out. Glad thevyoung man had help!!! Praise God...
There was another gentleman on the scene who made a great effort to help save the woman.
GOD'S TIMING IS PERFECT! THANK YOU JESUS!!!
That little boy saved his mother's life!
🙏🙏🙏💪💪💪❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh my God  I hate seeing children like that, I'm glad he still has his mother
The cop standing on the grass hollering is she in there is anybody in there while the kid is in the water panicking is insane 😳
Yo I'm sorry but she don't need to be driving!
That poor lady i hope is ok she has a superhero for a son, and he needs her .
Is she in there? Save her. WHAT??
I have seen officers that really jump in as soon as they arrive!
💔 I cried
❤🫡👍💯
“Is the car unlocked?”
Did she survive?
It does seem like the cop was not acting quick enough.  He could have busted the window,  to be a little more excited about the situation but i doubt it had anything to do with her being black.
The lesson..if you the kinda person who is sick with seizurr..never lock the door
When your time is not up…. There will be people to the rescue. ❤️
😢🤲😇🤲😇🤲😇
Wow
People who have had multiple seizures shouldn’t drive …sad
Thank u for ur immediate response in trying to save that kids mother.  😮
🥺 that poor baby
All that Mama gone  !! 😮😮
God bless and keep them.
So scary for the little boy he did great and saved his mother's life❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Poor kid...TRAUMA
The little boy is also a hero
Dude took way too long asking questions when urgency was needed
That's a traumatic thing for this child to see .❤❤❤😢
Galatians 5:13-KJV  For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
The cop didn’t do crap
Jeez. 💔💔
That poor kid.
There are great people on this world This is what civil service and law enforcement Sweet baby boy?💘💖💝🩷💙💙🎉🎉🎉
That God officer for all your efforts in saving that women and calming the child!
Wow, brave young man.  So glad they were able to help.
This what police,  good police  do
thanks to the little boy, cop and the good Samaritan and most of all GOD 💯❤🙏
Good samaritan had to step in cuz the cop want to act like hes back at Uvalde.
A tyrant cop saving a life, imagine that.
PREY FOR THIS CAR & THIS WOMEN OR MEN
God is good I tell you!🙏🏿
That child and good samaritan save the womans life.    That cop showed the sense of urgency of a sloth. Standing at the bank asking the guy in the water and then strolling in...wow. After the guy does all the work he tells him to bring her to shore. Hell, even using the window punch like a pu_$$y.  Surprised he didnt demand id from the kid and detain him before heading over ...
❤❤❤❤❤God bless his heart God bless his mama heart 💕
That’s one calm as$ cop! Cool under pressure.
PSA: To anyone who is conscious when the car goes into the water.  DO NOT struggle with the getting the doors open.  That is wasting too much time & energy.  … There’s a reason the trunk/end of the car always stays up as the car is sinking. & the back window glass is made different, easier to break.  … It’s because of this scenario exactly.  Crawl to the back of the car, bust out back window & go out that way.  & also.   If you’re too weak to break the glass, pull down the back seat, go into your trunk & pull the lever that’s inside of trunk, to pop it open.  DO NOT stay in the front of your car.   &. You can buy a handheld device, that will break the glass windows in your vehicle, if you ever get trapped in it. The device is inexpensive & worth every penny.  … Keep In middle console, or, cubby hole/pocket of driver/passenger door, easy access area.  .. I keep mine in middle console.   I hope this is shared to others, so it can possibly safe a live in the future.
Most terrified trauma story of that little boy's life he'll never forget, he broke my 💔 of how desperate he was😢
Both of the men helping were HEROS !!!! Thank you !!!❤❤❤
That cop didn’t do shit! Stands there as the boy tells him multiple times his mom! Shame on him for not rushing to action!
Thank you Cop and Gentlemen, for saving His Mom. That young child is going beyond to get helped for His Mom. Great job, young man, for getting help and letting know the severity of the situation. ❤
Wow. These people are awesome. My 1st thought was 'Damn, are there alligators in Texas'?
Yall giving props to the cop when he took his sweet ass time for a drowning victim…. He did a shit job and got lucky
Praying for you young man your mama's going to be fine that faith in Jesus Christ and thank them in to save your mama's life
WHY NO END SHOWN? Damn irritating not to see mom safe!!!!!
That cop has no sense of urgency.
That cop was useless.
I’m not sure if she survived or not
Is somebody in there while a child cried for help STRAIGHT LAME
That cop certainly took his time tho
Poor baby that’s super traumatic for him❤
I do not like the way this officer reacted he clearly did not care. If the second man wasn’t there, I doubt this officer would’ve went into that water
OMG...That poor child and his mother.Did she make it. God Bless whoever helped.
Omg them are angel police officers I don’t even know the lady and I want to say thank you thank you thank you
Praying the driver is okay!! Thank you to all that helped save her if she's okay!! If not, I still pray for them all!!
Brother you got the cape frfr
Amen
Cop was slow and sluggish.
Crying
Bruh stop asking if someone is in there and go check, what the hell. If the child’s desperate screams aren’t enough then surely the half sunken car would be enough to take immediate action and not ask stupid questions.
Slowest officer reaction ever.
Poor young boy I hope he's ok
ABC News oh we see if show the truth all main media will come stores who know what to believe I see lies but out on New media they deep state swamp CIA Hollywood elite Mockingbird media it not like old days
If he woulda jumped into action faster it wouldn't of been so dire, it appears but who knows
Oh that poor baby ❤
Thank god there were no gators.
That was so traumatic for this baby. I pray all of them are ok. 😢
Could the cop be any slower asking the most redundant questions. Just get there and save the women. Elmer Fud
Hallelujah
MY GOD HAVE MERCY😢 Thank THY FATHER GOD she is still alive. I pray for her full recovery ❤️‍🩹 IN JESUS MIGHTY AND HOLY NAME ! AMEN 🙏🏽
Seems fishy she drove that far off in to a pond.
🙏🏽😢 God Bless God Bless God  bless 🙏🏽❤️‍🩹
Tres heroes ❤️ bendiciones 🙏
🙏🙏🙏🙏 prayers up that she is doing well ❤️‍🩹
How was that a dramatic reaction?
Thanks for being there and helping this family. Thanks for helping this child that's visibly afraid for mom's life. The officer remained calm and that alone helped the child trust him with mom's life.
First I love the cop that stopped to help he didn’t ask dumb question he ask is she in there and went to work saving a life regardless of who was already there ,you never know how or when Burgos sends an Angel at your time of need ❤
I sure hope they cared for that boy. He was in shock. His Moma was about to die. God bless you all.
Afterwards, they still called him a racist.
God bless both of you heroes. We need more people in the world just like these two
🙏🙏🙏
Is she alive?
Aprire il cofano no?
poor boy so awful!
That cop didn't save no one... asking stupid questions knowing what the kid said ....Just plain trash officer. Thanks to the man who saved the lady
HE SHORE TOOK HIS DAMN TIME😮⚠️
I felt his fear, but he did an amazing job saving his mama.  I’m crying 😢 sweet boy.  God works in mysterious ways 🙏🏻
Prayers up for you young Man and your Mother❤❤❤❤😢
Thank you gentlemen!!❤❤❤
Heartbreaking
Brave young boy ❤
🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️ God bless all the good samaritans & this policeman!
In my area! Thank God everyone is ok
Bless that poor baby!! Such a brave lil man ❤
Oh thank god shes ok. Poor lil man would have never forgiven himself... he was just too lil to get her out on his own but he still saved her ❤ well done young man!!! Momma must be so proud of her baby boy ❤
Poor baby I hope his Mother was ok
Bro this cop was way too chill and had there not been another good Samaritan already helping idk if she makes it. How you going to show up and say "is somebody in there" after there a damn car in the water and a kid just told you SHE'S HAVING A DAMN SEIZURE!!!! SHE CAN'T SPEAK IDIOT.  .. wow
Im sorry man but is asking if anyone in there, jump in the water.. there’s cat in the water the child is articulating to you that his mother is in the vehicle and pure terror and desperation!
That kid just told you there's somebody in there. You nincompoop
If they yust put the camera away..
That cop is pretty slow though, the kid is crying telling him that his mom is insane the car, cop keep asking is there anyone in the car 😐
Healing 🙏🏾
Why did the lazy cop stand at the edge of the water while the kid was in the water looking for his mom!!!
Thank God for the Good submaritan rescuer and others who helped.
Oh dear Lord, thank you Jesus!!
Am I the only one annoyed at the cop's lack of urgency?
😢❤
Thank God that officer was there in time to save her! 🙏
“Is anyone in there?”  Nah the kid just made all that up to bring you to a sunken car in the pond for no reason ?? 🥴
There are adults who couldn't be as together as this lil man.
Saying a prayer this Mother makes a full recovery, in z Jesus name Amen .❤️🙏🏼  God Bless this young man he is a Hero for getting help for his  Mom. God Bless the Policenan and other man who helped rescue this woman. You are all Hero’s!!!   ❤
That cop walked so slow ghe almost went baclwards
God was with them all..
God bless all of you great soldiers of God a blessing
Oh my God, she must’ve been in there for so long like minutes are an eternity like that…. That little boy was soaked too. He got out which is also a miracle.
Why did it take the officer so long to get to the car and rescue lady Little boy was there first. That's sad.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Bless his little heart ! I truly Pray his momma is ok❤
Good Samaritan my a$$ b$tch a$$ cop ain’t even wanna get in is she in there? No shit u think its a prank wtf
God Jesus is all over all never no were your bless come from 🙏♥️
Did they save her?
That cop really didn’t wanna go in 😅
Many blessings to those who helped
❤Tk u for helping…Stay BLUE…
Was she saved?  All we see is the drama unfolding.
Who is recording???
Is she in there? The kid just told you donut.
😂 turn from your sins and be saved that's a true blessing 🙏 Amen
Listen to the dumb questions the cop is asking while the kid is calling for his mom and pointing towards the car 🤦🏽‍♂️
Oh that poor boy’s voice just breaks my heart!!  So sad to have such trauma at a young age… Hopefully he can focus on the good & know his actions saved his Moms life❤
The cop seemed like he could care less
Incredible composure on this young man's part.
A white police officer helping a black child rescue her mum & yet white police officers are supposed be  racist! According to the media
You would have never told Aletha lycos to step it up…. Js…. Mad respect ✌️
Poor little guy I pray he and his momma are safe and well ❤❤
Omg that poor kid!!
Thank you God
I could feel that fear in his face and voice !!!🥹🙏🏽
🙏👏👏👏👏
That poor baby 😢 So distressing, I can't even imagine. 💔
God bless all concerned
Thank you God.    God bless all of them
Poor baby, he will never forget this he is so worried about his momma. I pray he has someone that can comfort him and stay with that loves him until his Momma gets home. God bless them. Prayers.
Sweet boy, broke my heart. ❤
TELL EMS STEP IT UP !! you don’t hear that often.. he really cared about helping this woman n her child
How nonchalant the cop was and the boy taking action before him is crazy! He should be suspended at the very least.
God bless the child and the cops 😭🙏🏾🙏🏾
how is a cop a good Samaritan? its literally your job you get paid to do.
Wow, that's horrible in our state. If you have seizures I believe you really can't drive. I don't think they'll give you a license
That poor little boy. I can’t imagine how scary that would be for him. I pray that the woman is okay. ❤
My wife has epilepsy. Thank god she cant legally drive. I hope this women is okay
I wouldnt want to be saved by that useless cop. He has all the urgency of a sloth.
And why don’t they have the window poppers? SMH
Why would the cop waste time asking if she’s in there. The little boy just ran to you drenched in water freaking out. Telling you his mom is in the one and was having a derisive, please help. I would have ran so fast. Every second counts.
He won't get his boots wet to save a black lady
As you can see, the police officer was pulling at the door and pulling out the door and it wouldn’t open that is one flaw in the new cars. They electrically lock and you can’t get them open underwater and they’re talking about now selling these things that could break the water if you hit it underwater but what if you can’t find it ????!! This is ridiculous. It doesn’t make sense.
This is  why we need Law Enforcement and  Concerned  Citizens ito work together  ❤😊🙏 .
I really hate,  that they leave you without knowing what happened omg I need to knoooo😂
His pain. As a mom that’s one of my worst fears to have my baby crying like that bc something happens to me. I’m so glad she’s okay and healing. ❤️‍🩹
Omg! That boy's voice was breaking my heart! You saved your mama young man! I hope to God you are ALL doing well!! That sweet boy broke my heart.......…
What a terrible cop
Great kid, great cop!
Let's take 7 hours to rescue someone.
Why the fuck would you be recording this?
Why save them?
Poor little man :(
THIS COP IS DUMBER THAN A DOOR KNOB.. UHHH, IS ANYBODY IN THERE. R U KIDDING ME RUFUS😂
😢I'm so scared poor child thank you officer for being in the right place to assist God bless you
@"Good Samaritan Cop Rescues Drowning Druver  zbless Him!
Why is this hillbilly asking so many questions?
It’s Liam from shameless
That damn annoying screaming boy trying to save his mama. Son there is no reason to yell or be hysterical. It's only your mother almost drowning.
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO IS LIVID ABOUT HOW THE COP ACTED 💢💢💢💢💢💢
Good thing they didn't defund that cop
💛🌄🔥
"Tell EMS to step it up "  If we're already responding Emergent, there is no "more emergent". You go with due regard. There is no "slightly less due regard."
He could’ve had more of a sense of urgency. He literally kept asking the kid if there were someone in there, even though the kid already told him multiple times there was.
Blue state: defund police. Kamala: same, but reimagine. Reimagine what kamala????
Omg i just want to hold that little boy!! Thank god for you all!!! That was sheer terror!!!
Take your time officer no hurry. Heck let’s call 911 first and answer 20 useless questions before we drive there
THANK GOD the cop didnt do dumb shit like ask him his name and where he lived, wait for backup to arrive, stand around asking stupid questions like "how did this happen" before attempting to save her life
Yesh the cop helped but he wasnt in no fuvking hurry
Don't you dare tell me all cops are bad
That poor baby 😭😭😭😭 he must have been so scared I hope his momma is ok 😭😭😭😭
Is law enforcement that fuckn dumb
Amazing!!!
Thank God, they saved her and her son what a precious soul❤😢❤😢❤amen
That boy saved his mommas life, god bless both him and his momma
Thank you
Little boy saved his mama I think you mean! I did appreciate the cop’s call to tell EMS to hurry up I’ve never heard that before and it was comforting to hear it was treated with urgency! Was also great to see another person already in the water helping!
Is she in there? is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? Stressed me out. Way to hustle officer smh.
Bless his littleh
that cop was slow af
God bless 🙏
Commies coping hard about this one
GO SEE DUMBA$$!🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Soooo, why was the car in the water...😳
"is somebody in there" bro if you don't get your ass in the water 😂
Usually you have your drivers license revoked if you suffer from any illness that can cause instant and random loss of control
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Everyone believing the bad cop & black & white hate lies…… look at the dear white cop saving this precious black woma!!! People, do not believe the lies!!!  ALLLL careers and ALLL skin tones have bad apples!  Love & respect our brave policemen & people of all skin tones!   We are ALLLL God’s children!!  Act like it!  Maranatha!
How long was she under. Shes a trooper. Thank god for good people.
That poor brave baby boy😢🙏🩵Glad he was able to help his momma. A hero in his own right. Thank you Young Sir🙏🩵
"Is somebody in there?" Might be the dumbest question of all time given the situation
Damn why is it cops are always so gawd darn dull! The kid told him his moms in there and he’s calling out before getting I. The water what a loser fire that cop he’s a problem you can just tell how he would t listen to the kid and takes his time like mayne his ego is to big he can’t be told what to do by a kid no matter the circumstances 😂 they through mass charges on ppl like in Canada the rcmp are the worsed they are straight droids not even human one rcmp charged me with leaving the scene of an accident cause I didn’t pull over on the hwy for a flat tire when my exit was the next one so I just drove home lol that’s not an accident also gave me a Carless driving like wtf now when I go to get insurance won’t even be affordable insurance is huge scam it’s law to have it understanding but why is it 500 a month for a normal car not even high end wtf they make a killing so many ppl buy insurance they could easily have cheaper choices but they want everything unaffordable
That cop could care less
Brave kid. Awesome law enforcement officer ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Is someone in there wtf kinda question
The calmness of the first responder and not to panic given the severity of the scene. Stay professional, be professional, and know you are professional
Good job to everybody my only question is that cop death or something I heard that kid say my mom 3 to 4 different times he's even told in my mom is in the car before they even headed there I am wondering if he was drunk or something he should have known 100%  by the 5th "my mom is in there" Props on the officer for being there but I don't think he was there mentally only their physically something else is going on in that head
God nless you all ,poor baby terrified
The boy was telling the cop all along his mama had a seizure what does he think the boy was driving the car? The policeman wasn't in very much of a hurry was he but thank God they were able to break the glass or whatever they did
Aww what a brave young boy bless him & the people who were there at the right place and time ❤❤❤❤
A young hero forever ❤
God Bless you🙏🏽🙏🏽
🤦‍♂️that cop is no hero he saw the car drowning the kid told him she is having a seizure yet. Dumb cop still said is there someone in there 😤 instead of jumping into saving the woman. That other guy was the real hero
Great they saved her, but why was the cop asking is she in there? Is somebody in there when the boy had already told him MULTIPLE times that his mum was in there abd she had a seizure.   The boy was screaming at him to save her and hes just casually moving around like theres no hurry?? 😮
His sense of urgency is pissing me off
Thank you to everyone involved in the rescue. I am glad to have read in the comments that she is ok and recovering.
Is the car unlocked is a wild question
So what did the cop do again?
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I wish this would make national news instead of mostly the negative stories about police.
Any updates?!
Brave boy. Prayers for him and mum. Bless the guys that pulled her out.
Man poor kid…. I wish I could have been there to help him instead of watching helplessly from my phone 😢
That’s gator country to 😮
Ya cops are the worst….  Cmon people
Looks like it was in the nick of time she went under  and had to be resuscitated  praise God she is alive that boy needs a momma!😮
My heart is sad sending prayers and hugs
Now that's a good cop
Oh wow—thanks to all the rescuers!❤
officer thank you
🙏🏿🙏🏿❤️❤️
Screaming for help, casually waits and ask 2 times is someone in there derp
😭😭😭😭😭❤️🙏
Poor child 😢
Poor little man
God help this family.
THANK YOU TO THE 3 OF GUYS FOR SAVING THIS WOMAN
Great job to her son for getting help, the other person in the water helping (idk if it's the child pr not) & thank you to thay cop acting quickly to help her to safety ❤
Cop sure took his time.  Must be end of his shift
Being told she had a seizure, the cop should have jumped right in. Idjit.
Thank God she was rescued🙌🏾🙏🏽❤️
God bless both of you. That young man was so scared for his mom. Oh I felt so sorry for him. I pray that everything’s OK with her and him.
❤❤❤😢😢❤❤❤
Poor baby, his cries are so heart breaking. I'm glad your mom is better honey. 🙏
🌹❤️🌹God bless that👑child🌹, God bless everyone involved endlessly🌹☮️🌹
Im sorry, but that cop is slow as fuck, probably obese, the hell is rhat repsonse time
What a brave little boy
My question is, why was this cop so nonchalant, I would have been in that water immediately.....unless its Florida...the got gators 👎🏾
The little boy is sitting there yelling my mom's in there. My mom's in there and you ask her if she's in there. And is the car unlocked? You just acted kinda nonchalant about it. Don't you think you weren't in any hurry to get that poor woman out of that car?I think that's obvious
Stop asking stupid questions is there somebody in there is the car unlocked actions my boy actions there’s no time to waste asking stupid questions
Saw this on the news yesterday, brave young boy
My heart so heavy for that young man.  Pray she made it
Bless the son and the police
🙏🏾🙏🏾
God bless that child and those heros! They all are heros!❤
Good job! But come on man move a little faster please it’s life or death and you walking like you scared to get wet!
All people can be an angel or a devil. We choose to decide which one we will be. God gives us choices. I'm glad that at this time, we had two angels on site. God's peace and blessings to those involved. You are a Hero Young Prince. Great job Officer.
God they are slow
God Bless the men that helped and the family who crashed....
Omg hello os soneone in there??? Her son said help his mom shes stuck in the water
why do people drive knowing damn well they have seizures very selfish
What was the outcome I hate these quick little drastic issues that never give us the outcome I pray she made it poor child did everything he could
🤦🏻
Is someone else in there wtf you think you dumd 🫏 ss go look, how the $uck they suppose to answer you under water.
He so scared omg poor baby 😮
That woman drowning and that clown keeps asking if there’s some one in there when the kid had already told him his mother is in the car 🤦🏻 valuable seconds lost right there
Please everyone -  learn to swim, if you cant! Get a punch tool for your windows! Water is No joke! I'm glad the woman is alive. Thanks to the brave rescuers ❤ E
Then again, after watching it again,  there was maybe someone who went in before the police officer did!
Cops are actually not legally or contractually obligated to help save people from car accidents or drowning incidents. Hats off to this cop for not asking too many questions and hopping right into rescue mode.
The cop was certainly in a rush
Pray 🙏
That cops is kinda dumb
😢 gosh poor kid. Am glad they were able to save his Mom.
The only one I see is the police officer: no one else went in till after he went in to help!
Poor young man, but what bravery!
His sister was able to get out as well. I saw this on TV.
Always h3lp
Did she survive?
If she had a seizure she's not supposed to drive,,i have no sympathy she could have killed the child
Kids - she is in the car. Cop to the car- is she in der? Car- wht you think? Kids- she is in der  Cop - this is out of silabus (I don't know how to save 😅) Nice random dude- you know what I got this (did save her) cop- we did this together Random dude- 🤨
Poor kid
Im sorry but what the fuck.... he already told u his mom is in there the seat is completely submerged she cannot answer u stop asking 150000 fucking questions and save her damn life
What did the officer do😮
The back windows in cars are break away. If trapped in a car in water go to the rear and push window out with your feet. Never open side doors. The car will flood out and it’s impossible to open all the way.
Walking when someone is telling you to help on something like that shows a lot how serious you take ppls lives
❤
Is that Florida
Great son loving his mother going to get help and helping her get out 🙏🏿 glory to God for his mercy
Always keep a window breaker in your vehicle kit
That cop didn’t want to help until another guy started helping. Not a cop I would want helping my loved ones
Zero urgency wtf man. Seconds count. Be contentious
I have seizures I had 9 in a row I know it scared my kids, bless this  big hero’s heart
Glad he was with her ..... 😳
I hope she is fine, I wish she and her son will recover from this unfortunate event 😢
❤😢
Oh wow  😮
The boy is sp courageous. Dude if you're reading this, im really proud of you yeah. Im.
When seconds count....
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
The child... Oh my gosh!
Is somebody in there ? They can’t answer you it’s submerge I. Water and asking if the car is unlock ?? What was this officer thinking?  The boy already said it’s it’s his mom!!  You just run there and rescue them as quick as you can 😢. So glad they’re okay ! And police was there .
First cop was virtually useless
Glad the cop asked a woman that had a seizure and was unresponsive if anyone was in the car and ofc had to fact check that boys truth before getting his fresh clothes soiled poor officer
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYYONE ALREADY SAID THIS .... BUT HOW DID THE KID GET IN THE WATER LONG BEFORE THE COP....AND WHY IS HER ASKING THE KID IF SHES IN THERE.... WHERE ELSE WOULD SHE BE AFTER HAVING A SEIZURE SITTING ON THE BANK....AND ASKING IS ANYBODY IN THERE HOW DUMB........DUH
How did she get in there?!
Mom had enough let her go
Prayers Great Samaritans, Won't He He Do It, YES HE Will..Amen❤
I knew about the swimming, but the driving to?
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️❤️❤️
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I hope that child is ok as well. I hope that the trauma hasn’t caused him any permanent trauma. He was so scared and I don’t blame him for being so scared.He was so afraid for his mother.May God continue to heal his mom and may she have complete recovery!
Gods angels are everywhere
Any word on his mom?
IS Somebody IN THERE??? THIS KID JUST TOLD YOU…WTH MAN
HOPE EVERYONE SEES THE GUY WHO WAS ALREADY SAVING THE PEOPLE .. THE COP DID NOT HELP DO ANYTHING BUT BREAK A WINDOW
Yes, she's in there! Thanks to all of you. Above all, praise be to Jesus.
Glad she is okay. Sorry for that child's  trauma. Hope she stops driving if she has seizures. Dangerous for her and everyone else. Worked in claims for a few years and people selfishly drive knowing they have medical conditions. No different than some driving drunk.
This is why cops need training 10 fold ... dude had no fucking clue what to do
Thank God Almighty that there was some people to help him and his mom ❤.
It's out there and told the cops he's in the water but then he goes there it's like is she in there get your ass in the winter
Great job officer may you be blessed and protected by the blood of Jesus christ and hope the lady survived and is in good health brave young man
OMG WHAT A BUNCH OF ASSHOMES COMMENTS HE DID WANT TO HELP .
God is good. Incredible.
The boy went to the police for help, and all the man could do was jiggle the handle, terrible.
He didn’t get there on his own of course someone was driving the car
God bless all who helped in this rescue!!!!! 🙏🙏🙏
Not many cops like that these days
😢
Strong brave little boy —> young man - this kind of stress makes you grow up fast!) Excellent police -RESPECT & other gentleman  Be well, mama in Jesus name! Amen Ask JESUS TO HEAL YOU!  Read bible daily pray 24/7  Religion doesn’t save Only relationship with Jesus Christ of Nazareth!
To everyone involved thank you add to you baby I am so proud of you you didn't freak out you didn't try to go in you found help I am so proud of you
Sem like the cop was asking questions but wasn't listening for the answers.
Im glad they got her out. I hope that young man gets some therapy, that whole situation is traumatizing.
For years I didn't drive because of my seizures. People have constantly told me that I'm a horrible person and selfish for not driving. They tell me seizures aren't a real excuse. This is the EXACT reason why some people who have seizures should never drive. I hit the windshield when I was 17 because of my epilepsy and never drove again. If someone tells you they cannot drive because of a medical reason, just because you can't see that reason immediately,  do not shame them, or put them down or make excuses. This here is the literal proof of just how dangerous those medical conditions can be. Imagine if this would have been in heavy, fast-paced traffic. Imagine if it was a bus driver with children. This just enforces my hurt of the shame and hate I have recieved from family, friends and strangers who think they know better.
Cop needs better training and to learn how to operate at speed...Sincerely, LE Instructor
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
No offense. Its good The camera men wanted to help her too but He was very slow He asked if somebody was in there twice! Altough the little boy already said it. Cause The woman is in the WATER. The other guy was DEFINITLY helping her. Good Job. 👍
This fucking cop asking “is she in there?” Bro, what?
Praise God 👏
Unbelievable  . America police are not equipped with a glass breaker . shame . Should ask thief or drug addicted suppliers to America police Departments
Is that the kid from shameless ?
In California if you have seizures they take your driver's license. I think all states should adopt this law. I hate not being able to drive but at least I'm not putting my life or someone else's life in danger. 💜
The sacrifices we make to allow women to drive cars is insane
Hey !!   You Can't Park Here !!!
Kid clearly told him his mom was in there so why did he keep asking like a dumbass?
This baby got me tearing up
Omg, how terrible is this video touches my heart and soul,...that boy and the police are true heroes indeed 👍👏🐕😇🙏❤️🤐🙎👮way to go you all!!!
See that's America, we need to stop with all this other crap, people risk their lives for strangers AIN'T THAT AMERICA ❤ you and me.
Cop took long enough to get in there Jesus
Looks like he took his gotam sweet time to rescue her😕
The cop didn’t even react fast at all that’s obvious
The cop was on the ball.  Over never seen someone move so quickly
Poor baby scared for her mom. How the hell did her mom end up in there in the first place
😊😊😊🥰🥰🥰🤗You will be rewarded in Jesus's NAME dear COP😊
Pour boy 😢
Is the car unlocked?
Dude wtf
I live in this town and didn't even know about this... and it's a very small place.  Happy she was rescued and doing OK.
Thanks again God Thanks again universe thanks again God is son Jesus Christ our Lord and father in heaven and Earth praise bless joy and mercy
That poor baby😢
Lord Jesus have mercy
Cop is a failure.
That baby had to verbally command this officer to HELP HER!! Why the delay Bro smh 😢
😮😢
DIOS TE SIGA DANDO MUCHA FORTALEZA,,FUISTE ,Y SEGUIRAS SIENDO EL EROE DE TU MADRE
As a mama who also haves seizures this hits home pretty hard that poor kid
That little boy is a hero with the people who helped her Thank u
Awesome thank God for the son.  Thank God for who he is
Thus sweet child stayed strong enough to get help for his mother.  I’m so proud of him— even though I had nothing to do with his brave heart.  God bless the brave son, Good Samaritan and Officer for saving her ❤
Thank you Jesus Christ for having these men save this boys momma
What a dumb cop. Hears the boy screaming his momma is having a seizure and she sunk...gets to the cop then proceeds to start asking "is there somebody in the car?" Can't stand stupid people, especially stupid cops.
So nobody sees the cops lack of sense of urgency as a problem, and the fact that he wasted time standing there asking a dumb question... "Is somebody in there?" Clearly the driver seat is submerged in the water, how would anybody respond?? Then the boy is clearly fresh out the water and trying to get you to hurry up and save her, he already told you she was in there!
STAND UP AMERICA!!!
Why are you driving and tii having a siezure yoo thats crazy,glad they saved thos kids mother though
Thank goodness they were close by or driving by❤
That Poor baby. Bless him ❤
😢 the cries n the help n pain he points to the officer to help his moms broke me down
🫡
Lackadaisical aproach to the car while yelling, "anybody in there!"   Bro a kid just came to you hysterical about his mom in there as well as someone else in the water at the car yelling Momma....  Shouldnt have been able to tell from the body cam that there was a car or water, it shoulda been jostling so bad from the running to that car.
God bless You all
Every second counts in a situation like that. I don’t understand why he was so hesitant to get in the water to save her. Everything he did was slow
He sure took his precious time gettin to the car. I wonder fast he would have spead up if that was his mother in there😮😮😮
Please tell me his mama survived
Kid: she’s having a seizure help her  Cop: Is SoMeBoDy In ThErE Kid: my mom help her  Cop: iS sOmEbOdY iN tHeRe
I pray mom was ok.
This boy is a hero.he escaped the sinking car and got help.
Terrifying
I can only imagine how scared that little guy was, but under the stress of the situation he articulated what needed to be and helped save his mommas life. Great job young man, great job all of you!!
I hope she uses her experience to promote good will in these communities who have decided cops are their enemies. Most ppl who feel that way will only listen to someone who looks like them. I hope the kid gets help for his trauma.
That cop is completely useless. Pathetic
Is there someone in there?? Umm yes
If the dad didn’t leave to get milk that might’ve not happened.
I know that was so horrifying for that little fella thank you, father God, in the name of Jesus, the man and the other man little boy thank you father God, in Jesus name
😱🙏🙏❤️
Did she make it?
Most precious Blood of JESUS CHRIST save us and the whole world   Guaranteed to blind Satan and all evil influences and protects against all dangers
That cop was taking his sweat time
My heart aches for them
I  TRUST YOU  Abba Please come through  !!!! Oh My Yah !!!!
Poor boy ❤😢
The cop sure really rushed the shit uhh..like wow the sesnse of urgency is like -100
May God bless everyone that save this lady!! Thank you Jesus
How are you gonna stand there wasting time asking if someone is in there while the car is under water?  Get in there and save her the boy told you she was in there.
Impresionante y maravillosa manera de sentir de este niño. Grande!!!
They never finish telling us what the outcome was! How do you know she was ok?
Thank God for direction n guidance for young boy able articulate help for his mom n not panic God continue to watch over this Family..n the Good Samaritans..
You can’t park there lady
God Bless! ❤❤❤ Everyone can make a huge difference for someone! Love to see when that difference is a positive one! What an example are these men and her son made for her!!!💐 Also, God Bless her son. What a terrible situation he went through! Very strong young man!❤
Thank you God
The cop was asking some really lame questions… is somebody in there?? Really?
She was later issued a citation for driving while submerged.
Always keep a window breaker in your car!!!
The Good Lord sent the man to help the little boy !!!!
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Youtube needs to bring back the relevant dislike/thumbs down on a  comment for all these really toxic comments in regards to the cop and the skin color of everyone involved in a very serious situation that can happen to anyone.
You mean a little boy, a civilian who was already on it, and a cop save a woman.
Poor kid go save his mama
I find this so traumatizing as an epileptic
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭
When that dipshit started yelling as if he would get a response I felt instant rage.
💔💔💔💔 Thank God Mom’s ok. Son is going to need some therapy 😢
He just told you his mama in there WTF
Get in there every second matters...
Thank you GOD for sending your Angels ❤
Lol good Samaritan, hes asking questions instead acting and who wouldnt help seriously
Omg that poor child! I hope she's ok!!!
Well done, officer,good Samaritan and young man
Why yell is someone in there if she is drowning I don't think she could answer?
Someone give that baby a hug
She is trying saved her mother back on life and police 👮 rescued her saved life 😊
I lost my aunt back in 2018. She was having a seizure while driving and drove into a duck pond. My grandmother and her 2 kids were in the car. Everyone made it out but she drowned. ❤
My people 😭please please in this World all  we  brother and sister s try dont have problems with nobody ...you dont need to have one emergency to change ...we need love every body God bless this Lady and her chid sending a. big hug to each one 🙏😇😇😇🙏🙏🙏🙏🙋🌷🌷
Hmmmm, thinking she would not have chose the bear….
Good Bless him & praying for a speedy recovery
Move slower
Thank God for these guys helping his mom.God is so good.Praying for a speedy recovery 🙏🙏🙏
Free Palestine who are going through worst times all the time
In my opinion he shouldn’t be asking “if somebody is in there” while slowly walking, you’d think he would have dove into the water and immediately started to make entry. Thankfully the young man was diligent and reacted appropriately.
Why that camera in this case????????
His response was so slow I can't believe that I would of been running an diving fast.not saying hello is somebody in there the car is fucking under water. ""I'm down here unconscious help me
Why was he filming though?  I wouldn't think to film someone having a life or death crisis...I'd just help.
This broke my heart and that boy was soaked so somehow he escaped and went in got help omg bless his heart
Lack of urgency from the officer.. every second counts though thankfully the woman lived
Man, imagine how much more urgency he would've had had there been a crime committed.
What is a punch?
Was she rescued in time, I fear that she wasn’t 😬? That poor lad witnessing it all, so traumatic for him x
That cop acted so slowly
I'm sorry I'm drowning and I'm supposed to answer bimy
Im bawling. Lord help this family!🙏🏼💔😢
It goes without saying that I'm very glad the mother was saved, but the boy seemed to know his mother was having a seizure. I'm just wondering why she would drive when she knows it's dangerous to drive if you suffer from seizures. Example in hand.
Oh God!!! Thank You Jesus!!! I can't stop crying. I pray she has a total speedy recovery. I thank God her son didn't drown. He made it out to get help for his mother. God blessed the two who came through. I'm so glad they got her out in time.
I saw this on TV Last night
Cop was horrible.  The little boy already told you she sunk in the car.....dummy said is there anyone in there🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷just slow
That's mommas Lil rock! ✊🏽
Damn if that cop could move any slower
Did he ask the boy if the car was unlocked?
Inutilll
Man that cop took his sweet time
Thank you for helping out cope and for the son getting help for his mom
That cop could have been so much more helpful. Shame
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽so much
😮😢😢
The lack of ergency this cop had is ridiculous ....I've seen more "enthusiasm " from leos wen they ask for id's and get a no and there egos get hurt smfh good job 👏 officer (sike)!
Gods Angel just arrived😊
I do hope that they don't just thank  God With their mouths , but action aswell, ,   in other find an SDA church & get baptized for Jesus sake ,n stop sinning , John 3 v25-20,  confession is made bzy our mouths,  but remember that love is a verbs , read these bible verses, Isaiah 29 v13 , Mark 7 :6-9 ,  Matt 7 v,21-25  Luke ,6 v46 ,   Matt 1 v21 , ROM 110 v9-21,,  Luke 13:3
God bless those who saved her.❤
The poor child was so scared I hope they're doing okay
Got gonna lie it pissed me off the officer didnt act faster at the beginning
Thanks for the added intervention from the officer. There are Angels everywhere. ❤❤❤❤❤
Yeah, still good people left in the world not many
Black people, come to my house, I will give anyone free swimming lessons. For real. South Florida.
First off it was the man that really rescued her because the cop was too scared to get in the water and second of all why are people that suffer seizures even eligible to get a drivers license they should not be able to drive or be eligible to receive a drivers licensejust because of this reason they could suffer at seizure in traffic and crash into the water or crash themselves or crash into other people and cause great bodily harm to other people that should be illegal for people who suffer seizures ever a car or a license
🙏
My heart breaks for that poor child so scared for his mama 😢💔🙏🏼
Who DF is filming
I love my city! thanks to the few good people that's still out there and to that young man❤❤
What if crocodile in the water 😮
What an idiot... the kid said clearly that she had a seizure.  How can she respond. We need survival and swimming courses. Stop relying on these idiots. They stand around and let our people burn, bleed and die.
What a brave and smart boy!
Hop in C'MON
I don’t feel the cop cared enough 😢 why keep asking if there’s someone in the car AFTER the boy crying telling you his mom is in the car??? That’s seconds taken from her life😢
She was having a seizure 😭. See for all you ROAD RAGERS -- you never know what can be going on with a driver. A heart attack, a stroke, and yes as you see a seizure. The MOST HIGH put people in the right place at the right time. Period. Good job kid and helpers ,🫂
I'm just curious.. how did that car end up there... I didn't see no road near the water...
So whats the outcome???
Oh my God, the ladies in the car.Hoping to get her out a little boy has a lot of courage with his mom.Thank you policeman.I lot of people think I'm bad.Not all of all policemen are bad that good cops and bad cops email for them.The angel guided them together
I'm thankful she was rescued and her son made it out of the car.  That alone is a miracle.  Was this her 1st seizure?  Please don't risk driving if you have a history of seizures.  You can't be replaced.
🙏🙏🙏🙏
God bless you ❤❤❤
God 👑 is good 👍
Omg MOVE YOUR ASS! It was like that cop was looking for any reason not to get wet
😘💋😍🥰🙏🙏🙏✝️✝️✝️💜😇👍
The brake pedal is the one on the left.
"Is somebody in there?" ..... like ..... youre a cop
That cop took his sweet as time
I hate the fact that he asked if anyone in there. When you are having a seizure you cannot respond. But I guess not everybody knows that
Also the cop question if someone was in there the lil boy said told him already that she had a seizure and then the boy said yes it’s my mama again he as a son did everything he could thanks for that young boy not giving up and the cop said here to hand the man the stick to the man who was already giving his best shot
Is the car unlocked... Really??!!;/
Thank God for this brave Son and this caring Officer🙏🏽
Unfortunately, people with active seizures can’t drive due to this danger. So glad she is safe!!!
If you have seizures you shouldn’t drive, am I the only one thinking this?
She was NOT breathing and unconscious when they got her out...Medics etc..performed CPR and she was then on a Ventilator for couple weeks..SHE IS ALIVE AND RECOVERING HER SON SAVED HER LIFE.....WHAT A TRUE HERO HE IS. 🙏
❤❤❤❤❤
This is so heartbreaking😢I pray she made a full recovery. Thank God her son was able to get her some help
❤THANK YOU JESUS AND THE HEROS
😢 that poor young man, he must be so traumatized. May his family make a full recovery and blessings to all who helped.
I'm surprised they didnt ask for a supervisor to come.
Im sorry but that was the slowest reacue ever
You are an angel  sir
🙏🙏🙏
The kid saved her, poor little guy, i hope they are both ok 🎉
I hate to say it but he just didn't seem like he was into to big of a hurry I wouldn't have been either if she was on drugs but she was having a seizure
I don’t like the way he took his sweet ass time. And then asked is there anyone in there? The kid just told you this when he was talking to you ass hole!!!
Thank God for her son, and everyone that helped 🙏
Good people help people.  End of message.
He said she was in there and he still asked smh
Quit wasting time and get in the f****** water
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Was that Liam?
"is somebody in there?!  "Is the car unlocked?! 95% of cops are useless. Go check.... He's crying and clearly in distress.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Alot of vehicles now have laminated front windows like your windshield which makes a center punch useless. Just so people are aware.
🙏 🤲
Thank God for the baby boy and that officer 🙏❤️🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
Sometimes it exsasperate me how  cops can be very lil help . Random people do a better job and move faster for what I've seen many cops many times.  I'm sorry but didn't the kid told him that from the beginning. Why is he asking such a dumb shit . I promise if this cop would have been alone, he would have let this woman die.  Just by the way the kid was desperate and crying for help he got I'm the water so save his mother while he stood and the kid is telling him still his mama in there and he's asking some really stupid shit . Omg this made me so mad.
"iS tHeRe SoMeBoDy iN tHeRe?"  NO SHIT SHERLOCK. Two kids and another man were telling you there was, while they were fighting to get her out. Wtf do you think, officer?
Is the car unlocked? 😂 wtf
How Brave he was and how incredible there was more than one helping ✝️💙💙💙✝️
Cop wasting time asking if someone is in there... yes the boy didnt show up soken wet and take you to an accident for no reason.
Poor boy...
BRAVE LITTLE MAN, CONTINUE 2 ALWAYS BE THERE 4 YOUR MOM. I LOVE U BOTH.😢❤
That poor child breaks my heart to hear the fear in his voice. 🙏
Damn both did yall thang ❤
Thank God this woman is alive. The police didn’t have as much urgency to the situation as I would’ve liked though. Good thing there was someone already there helping to get her out.
This braked my heart,God help please 🙏
That’s like 20 min from us I knew i recognized this video
Lord help us to be human and help each other . Save Humanity and you save yourself. God bless the brave men who helped this woman and her child in distress.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Wow, poor kid
how slow the police officer….
That camera view guy is slow af
Oh my God. I pray the little boy is okay. I pray his mom is safe and okay, and thank God for the young man that was there to give help
How the hell somebody else got a bigger sense of emergency then the person that gets paid to have some kind of sense of emergency? The lil boy CLEARLY explained the situation and u asking the same damn questions.
“we don’t need men” 😂
😭
He loves his mom❤❤❤❤
God bless the good people that still exist in the country🎉🎉🎉
Democrats want to get rid of the police.  Just remember that next time ypu need help.
Poor baby to witness the potential death of his mon 😢. Hope all is well 🙏🏽
That cop is a dumb ass asking if somebody in there how the fuck they gonna answer you when they under the water
The child rescued his own mother the cop was very slow about doing his job
Bro get the head rest out of your truck and break the fucking window!!!!
Coo was kinda chillin. “Is somebody in there?” Wtf the car is underwater 😂
And yall said all Florida cops are racist.... fuck that he saved that woman... great job officer
The cop sounded like he didn't want to go in there.
💙💙💙
You can’t park there
Poor baby is desperate, and he stands ashore asking if there's somebody in the car... I think being stupid is a requirement to be a cop in the united states
There were Angels on earth, God Bless all
Why was he asking so many questions?
❤❤❤❤❤
The cop is literally dumb with no urgency. The kid literally told you his mom was in there and you just casually stroll into the water and ask if anyone is in there tf
Cop was moving in slow motion
I hope she’s okay! 😮 Any updated?
😢😢😢😢😢
U wouldn’t even seen an ounce of hesitation from me. I’m going in right away and trying my damnest to rescue that person. Hope the mother is ok
I thank God for the two men and the young boy. For doing all they can save someone else's life. To be willing to risk your own life to save another person is truly a awesome thing.
God bless this child Good bless the rescuers
Thank you Jesus for saving this woman's life for this little boy in Jesus name
It's got to humbling to ask for help from the people you can't sand
i’m in no way discrediting that he saved her but that officer is not moving fast enough for me😭😭😭it’s def because i’m a firefighter/paramedic on a rescue team that deals with this and much worse every shift, so im hyper aware that quite literally every single second counts. i would have told the kid to take me to the scene and tell me what’s going on on the way and would have sprinted to and in that water the second i saw the car bc obviously she’s in there cause that’s what he just told him lol. the officer, the other civilians and the kid are all heros and thank god were able to get to her all because of her little boy! hoping she recovers and gets to go home to her family, im sure she’ll be so proud of her son💙
This is what protect & serve means! Well done.
That poor boy..what a horrible experience for him..he will never forget he almost lost his mom..thank God and the people who helped rescue her
The police seen to be moving in slow motion 😢my God I am so glad she's ok ❤
But why drive when you know you normally have seizures? What's the point.
❤
I’m so grateful they all rescued her. 😢❤
Damn it that boys desperate plea hurts. I pray with all I have his mom is ok...can I get an update please.
God bless them, great people!
That police officer was taking his poor sweet little time so he could record and have a story to tell.
I'm a Epileptic and this was heart stopping to watch 😖 The moment l was diagnosed l stopped driving, this was my biggest fear having a seizure with my son in the car! That poor boy 💔💔💔
The cop is moronic
Dodge Chargers are for the Law. Stop buying them if you can't drive them. Sad situation.
That cop had no sense of urgency.  None.
🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is the momma ok? I am crying and praying. Is she ok?
Thank you God for giving your child the wisdom to go for help for his mother and thank you God for putting your servants in place and to be willing to help TGBTG 🙏🏾
When the cop walked up to the water mad slow standing there asking if somebody was in the car while the kid was literally screaming.........like cmon bro tf you doin
But why the patrol waisted time asking if still somebody there, he hasn't hurry up for helping the person under water
That brave child! 😢
Liam.from shamless
Is there someone in there $#@##@ Yes she just told you wtf
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks for that kid being there
That kid is practically heartbroken… thanks  goodness there’s decent people around. May almighty Lord bless everyone involved in rescuing this woman. 🙏🏽
My heart goes out to you young mang ❤❤❤❤❤❤ hope you and mommy are doing well ❤️💜💕
The cops was asking question while the person inside was dying 😢😢😢, it look he didn't want to get wet😂😂😂. On others' time, the cops will not ask question in jumb into the water. Thank God the good Samaritan saves the lady with the kid.🙏🏼❤️👍👏👏👏

My mother had epilepsy and as a child it can be so terrifying. This kid got help and saved his mom!
I'm a person who was a passenger in a car with a person who had a seizure. Luckily it was peak time traffic and the car slowly went into a bollard. I didn't even know this person had epilepsy. This is going to sound harsh but I think people who suffer from epilepsy or who can pass out from low sugar due to diabetes should make their potential passengers aware of these problems. I can see when a person is too drunk to drive and can assess the risk and decline to be a passenger. I cannot assess the risk to my safety if I don't know about your health conditions. It is different with heart attacks and strokes. That is unexpected medical emergencies, but epilepsy and diabetes sugar drops is a known risk which you know you have and I should have the option to decide if I want to risk my own personal safety.
I'm so glad that everything can out okay. Thanks to  all who were involved in the recovery ❤❤❤❤
Sirs! May God bless you and your families to the fullest and protect you all and that Lady & her so and loved one's. I know Police get a bad rap. You put on your Uniform that day to protect & serve.  I'm sure you had no idea how your day would go. Yall's heroic act will never be forgotten. 🫶🏾🙏🏾👍🏾  God Bless
Cop didn't wanna get wet, piggy piggy pigggggyyyy
The little boy said - "She's having a Seizure". So obviously that's how the accident came about.  Bless All Concerned.
This broke my heart to see the distress this child was in!!! Thank GOD he came upon someone that was more than willing to help!!! I 🙏🏽 that all are doing fine and on their way to a full recovery!!! Thank you to the Good Samaritan that didn’t hesitate to help…May GOD BLESS you abundantly!!!
Thank you sir 😢
That cop needs to be fired.
🙏🙏🙏
Boyy yall ever heard of gators
Thank God she is safe 😊
Well done everyone ❤
This cop could move faster if it's a white family. Too slow. Why he is asking if someone is there if the kid said his mom was there
Dude the kid said his mom was in there and youre standing there saying is she in there? Is somebody in there? No, no ones in there thats why that terrified child is there panicking crying telling you she's in there
Like hurry the f up
OMGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!
Saw this on FOX News earlier today. The boy got the cop's attention, then a good Samaritan stopped to help the cop when he saw him go into the water. Thank goodness everyone's ok. 💕👏👍💯
Could the cop have moved any slower? This is the moment most cops (when they're children) wait their entire lives for to be the hero and save someone. This cop lolligagging around taking his sweet ass time. Thank god for that civillian was acting fast
Am i the only one that thinks the cop took just a little to long to try and save the mom? The son already said she was in there. Then he stood by the water for a minute and asked if anyone's in there. I'm just saying, i wouldn't have asked again. I would have just ran in to check wether it seemed like everyone was out or not. But if you didnt see the mom out then  you should already know. And just run in immediately. I mean im glad they saved her but he seemed a little to slow and waisted precious seconds.
God Bless you SIR I AM CRYING
Cop asks questions instead of taking action immediately,  what the f?
Systemic racism my ass.  In appartheid South Africa, they would have let her drown.
God bless those officers and the young man
I'm not sure how to react, is this urgent or a stroll in the park.
He's moving as fast as his slow ass can move.
The cop isn't a "good Samaritan" he's required by law to intervene.
This is proof cops take their sweet ass time to do anything...a normal human being would have jumped in the water instantly if a kid was pleading and seeing the car sticking out of the pond..cop is interrogating the kid while hes walking slowly twards the water like he dosent wanna get his shoes wet
Poor kid hate to see things like this pray shes ok.
People always expect you to help when they want it.
He just said someone had a seizure and he yells is anyone in the car??? Really, wasting time,as a person I would of jumped in fast, he was asking questions and scared...WHY DO THEY HIRE COPS LIKE THIS
Thank you to all who daved the kady bkess 👍🤗🙏💖🇬🇧
Thank God the police were able to save her. The fear in his voice😢  of I can stop crying.
Thank you, Jesus ❤  thank You for sending the man and police to help!  Maybe she shouldn't drive😢
❤️❤️❤️
THATbis how we all should treat one another~ Color means nothing.
I PRAY TO TMH THAT HE COVET THIS FAMILY AND MOM WILL SAFE,GREAT JOB YOUNG MAN❤
I'm glad she's OK by why tf did it take the cop so long to get in the water. kept repeating "is someone in there?" like the kid just told you and yoy see someone trying to get in the car. some sense of urgency on this guy smh
Good thing she was safed God  less
Praise God all is well!
Bless The Lord 🙏🙏
Que estupida pregunta !? Y fuera de tiempo ⌛️ lo que tienen que hacer en esos casos es moverse y sacar el carro lo antes posible si no lo pueden abrir para sacar a la mamá !!!! Ya el noño dijo que si está su mamá !!!
The guy sounded really chill and not in a hurry though when the kid was freaking out like that I would be thinking that there would be some sense of urgency
The cop doesn't sound concerned at all! Is the car unlocked? Get your ass in there and help! Is she in there? Omg, get in there, the son said she was! He should be ashamed of himself!!!!
Omg.... Thank God thank God thank God!! That little boy's face.... I can't take it.
In a time of Sheer Panic, that young boy said exactly what needed to be said to the officer or any person that stopped.  I am so proud of him running to save his Mom. Several Heroes here.  I pray the Mother will be recovering fine. Great Rescue all of you ❤
Taken his sweet ass time. Wtf
That poor baby bless his heart i haven't driven in awhile I've been scared the same thing is going to happen to me as i suffer from them it can come on your best days when you think nothing wrong in glad that young man is ok
That’s a strong kid to do that. Sad video
What is de cop doing on the other side of the care while the other man in the water tries to save her?
The first cop wasn’t in any hurry to get in the water
The level of situational awareness and mental clarity a lot of kids show in high stress situations is crazy.
Yeah but the cop had to ask first if there was somebody in there, that's BS. I just saw a video where a driver drove onto a lake right after he witnessed an accident on the bridge above it without hesitation, without asking if there was: somebody in there. That's a real hero!
Cop was in no hurry
They don't make them like you anymore you went above and beyond what a beautiful person you must be
There are GREAT Cops around.😢
🙏🏾🙏🏾😭
Thats a fantastic son ...god bless him .
God Bless you, son. You are amazing!
Thank God she will be okay. Thank God the young son called for help
God is good all the time and all the time God is good, he alway keep his Angels. Camped all around us everyday, God bless the young man his mother and the 👮 who was sent by God to rescue this mom to God be the glory 🙏🏿 🫡 to the Cop 👍🏿
Thankful that cop had the help he needed from that Good Samaritan.
God is GOOD TWO OR MORE IN AGREEMENT!!
Is she in there? Like wtf do you think this is officer smh
Ok but can we please take a break from driving for a while and get on some meds? FOR ME, I mean. I’m sure the ER doc will know how best to help the lady!
To everyone  who has seziures don't drive because this will happend to you am happy that mother is ok  the boy was brave and not scared
Kid did what most grown adults couldnt do glad they goth came out safe
Thank you  3 but most of  thank God for save that little boy mom  god thank you we give you all glory honer and praises for ever Amen 🙏♥️
Good grief!
God Is good all the time
I the rest of the story
Cop was moving at the speed of smell
Thank you guys for being there.Just the right time you are heroes😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Great job kid and that officer was very helpful and amazing. 🤝
I thought cops were killers.
Thank God for the son and the rescuers. I pray the Mom fully recovered.🙏
God bless them all
Every now & then you see something that gives you hope for mankind!
The urgency is -1000 here, bro said "do I have to?"
That have me all choked up and teary eyed. Thank God for looking after them .
😢😢😢😢
Lord help her
So glad she made it. Brave little soldier, her son. The man there and the officer for doing his job..
God bless that young boy he was so terrified n ran to get help! All three of those people saved her life! Thank God she surrvied!
The only thing that bothers Me is, the little Boy clearly said," My Mom is in there she's having a seizure!". So why did the Cop KEEP asking is she, anybody in there? Thats valuable time of life or death!
Let's only give credit, when credit is due!
🙏👍
😢😢  Thank you Sir!  Thank you Jesus!  🙏 🤲
What an idiot. He just stands around and asks questions. "Is she in there? Is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked?" THE KID IS DESPERATELY TELLING YOU THAT SHE IS. GOOD GRIEF.
Omg seriously  it's anyone in there  insted of runing to help really . 😒😒😒
That baby was STILL trying to save her along with the officer
The cop didn't do it ....her son and the man in the water .....he was yelling my Mom is in there and  the Copis yelling is anyone in there ????
Judiação meu Deus
God Bless that child
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cop wasted some valuable seconds asking if any one is in the car. wtf. 🤬
So thankful she's going to be ok & to the good Samaritan who was only doing what he could to rescue her until officials could step in, all involved are hero's with pure hearts!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Is there somebody in there? What did lil man tell you !
God bless, in the name of Jesus.
Amen god bless everyone
I am so glad they saved her and that she is OK.  That boys pleas tugged on all my feelings.  Be proud young man for looking out for your mom.  You saved your mothers life by being informed and knowing how to get help!
The cop did a horrible job didn’t seem to believe that yeah his mom is in there help her!!!!! Cop didn’t want to get wet I guess
Is somebody in there?! He just told you very clearly 😤
This cop should be ashamed of himself and retire. What a pathetic "rescue".
Is someone in there??? Just so much care in voice.  Is the car unlocked? Like bruhhhhh
Don t  ask jump
"is she in there? Is somebody in there" NO SHÍT SHERLOCK, OTHERWISE 5HERE WOULDN'T BE SOMEONE SCREAMING FOR HELP
Wish I could’ve been there told hold that little buddy in my arms until they helped his mama. Poor thing. ❤️😔
Sometimes they say everything happens for a reason, this video makes me think about that. He said she was having a seizure so I assume that’s why they ended up in the lake. For example, if she had the seizure a little later, the lake wouldn’t be there. She would’ve went past it. But if that didn’t happen there could’ve been a much worse accident  like a high speed collision with that being said I hope they’re both OK and recovered.
What's up with all the division in the comments? Race based assumptions with zero evidence. Stop declaring every white man the devil incarnate. That's exactly where the real enemy wants us, at each others throat.
Yall need to tell the story accurately...... The cop did not save her, and he was in no rush to save her. Even asking if someone is in there asking dumb questions when he was supposed to dive right in and help the victim.🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
Why did the first cop have zero sense of urgency?
Auh duh oooookaaay duh is dah car unlocked duh is she in thar comeon get on the dam ball get that fat but wet
How much I want to go through my screen to help as well, so glad they got her out and I hope she has a speedy recovery
THANK GOD there ok I got chills when I seen that baby face GOD IS SO GOOD
The police didn't move fast enough or cared enough for me
Oh, this one got to me😢
Made sure his camera stayed on for this one
God bless you all 🙏🏽
Thats the most pathetic attempt to save a life where else wold she be do you want him to give instructions you mump
Are you seriously videoing this when that lady is drowning
Got to be the slowest cop ever literally won't even go in the water is she in there is she in there why don't you get in the water and check That's why we're paying you for and then walk slowly all the way up there just weird
Why is the cop screaming is somebody in there ? When the son is literally telling you his mom is in there
Poor baby boy❤
Wow
U mean theses tyrants don’t just shoot people?
Oh my goodness 😢😢😢😢he was so brave . Thank god for the wonderful people who jumped in to help the police officer and this young man for 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️
Poor child 😢
❤❤🙏🙏🙏 thanks Lord
That cop is an idiot
Officer ddnt rush,he took forever jumping in ,only got in bc the child was back in alone trying when he finally decided to get wet he goes to the the back passenger side? And just pulls on the handle20×? Then a random jumps in and pulls her out the driver side  swims around and he tries handing her over to him and"oh just put her over there"? Like dude this cop  DID NOTHING he just took forever and pulled on a locked handle the WHOLE time! Poor kid,this is traumatic!
Oh my god that baby.  😢 I'm glad she's alive, and I hope he's OK. That's so much trauma for a little dude. Also the cop was being kind of annoying with the "is somebody in there." He said it so many times
Gators in that part of Texas brave Kid and Men
The boy is saying stop asking questions and “help her”. The boy is the true hero.
Just broke my heart this little cute boy trying to save his momma bravo my love u did great job 😢I send u big hug
Slow ass cops. That was wack the only way they must of saved her is luck because any emergency happen too late. He's telling u someone's in there real HERO would of moved faster alot faster she really got lucky. White cop I BET
God bless this precious boy. He saved his mother's life. I hope she's doing okay. ❤
😢 than  bless i😂
Damn they act like they had no hair to try to help them look up slowly moving she going to be in drowned
Why would he say if someone is she in there the boy told her she was in there she's trapped in there and it seemed like he just took his time he wasn't even hurrying to get to her
Bless them
🙏🙏🙏
Women drivers how that even happen
AMEN LORD 🖐🏾🙏🏾🤲🏾 😇😇😇 OF GOD ON THE RESCUE 🖐
Pobre hijo, cuanto sufrió por su madre😢
The police at like he didnt hear what the boy said. Yes dummy, there's someone in there. He took his time
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
The officer was that concerned
That poor baby omg .. he’s was soo distraught
All this while holding a phone. Wow, imagine how much faster she could have been saved without it. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Sorry, but that little boy and the good samaritan saves that momma.  That cop seemed skeptical and hesitant at first.  The kid was drenched and panic-stricken.  It was like he needed confirmation from the guy already trying to help.  I had to watch it a few times cuz I really wanted to talk myself out of it.  That poor boy was begging this officer for help and he stood there trying to get confirmation from the good samaritan before he did a damn thing?! Maybe Im seeing it differently, but this made me more angry than anything else.  Thank GOD that other guy was there.  I would hate to think what that "officer" would have done had he not been.  Wow. 😢 Glad to hear the momma made it and praying she makes a full recovery.
Bro said is somebody in there when the boy came crying that his mom is stuck like why are you asking the stupidest questions and stalling
What a brave smart quick thinking child. Bless him and his mother.
Electric car windows are nothing short of deadly
That poor baby, how horrific.
That young man did such a great job helping his mom..
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
That cop walked slow to help the person in the car if it wasn't for the other man saving her😊
Obviously that lady has had seizures before if her little boy knew what it was so she shouldn't be driving.
That GOD she was Not driving alone
Cop was too damn slow to make a move🤦🏿‍♂️
I'm almost positive that boy is Liam Gallagher from Shameless.
weird. did she let the kid out of the car before she drove into that lake?
I ain't gonna lie. That broke my eyes a bit. That poor kid.
That poor child .Beyond blessing 🙏🏾🙏🏾
THANK YOU LORD JESUS FOR THE OFFICERS HELPING TO RESCUE HER.❤️ 🙏❤️
Is somebody in there why yes he done told you once his momma is in there and then you stop and ask the guy standing in the water trying to get in the car is someone in there my goshhh can he move any slower either iam very happy the lady and her son is ok and thank you bunches to the random guy who helped her and yeah thanks also to officer got a clue for his speedy reaction
Maaaan dat laaassheit waasseit
Man that boy is one tough child he got out and got help that says alot about how he is raised an how great of a mom she is to him. It's times like this you hope to find the right people in the right place when you need them.
God bless those that helped this child keep his mother alive😢🙏🏽❤🙏🏽♥️
Thank You so much, for saving her. Brave young man, you're a hero, for saving your mom. God bless you
Oh my, the boy knew she was having a seizure.
I dont like that he ask is she in there the child clearly said she was
🙏🏽
I'm glad he saved the woman's life but it's almost like he's second-guess the kid cuz the kid is soaking wet and told him my mom is down there in the car she had a seizure and when he comes up to the vehicle he says is she in there😮
The cop tho! Wny was he asking those questions? He made the boy more anxious resulting in the boy saying "c,mon help her"
🫂🙏
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
A woman (probably a single mom) who needs a man to save her. shocking...
Poor baby boy had to see that
He was not trying to help fr 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣
Lord bless 🙏
My heart is breaking!! Did she survive?
The son called for help and the police officer saved her life God bless them all ❤
I had a seizure driving my mustang luckily it was a standard once my foot came off the gas it slowed and sputtered I woke up I. The middle of the hwy not knowing what happened.
Imagine that, cops helping people and saving lives instead of killing people and destroying lives😮😮😮
Goid samaritan ??? Where! He asking is somebody in there as if the boy didn’t just exclaim that!
“Is there someone in there? Is the car locked?”  Are you STUPID? Yes someone’s IN THERE my god.
This break my heart and bring me tears seeing  this kid desperately trying to save  his  mom  😢😢
I pray the mom is in good health. Bless her son and the officer
God bless the two man for saving her life all things through Christ who strengthens them to God be the glory amen
"is somebody in there?" As multiple ppl are screaming for your help 🥴 just take your time there, buddy
What a brave child, he deserves a medal!  I  am so glad she was saved! Thank you for the police 👮🏻 for their bravely and quick action! ❤
The cop should have stood around asking questions a bit longer.  "Anybody in there?" .... 👀 no doors or windows are open and no one is anywhere near the car so I think we can safely assume SOMEBODY IN THERE SIR 😂
That looks like somebody that don't even care what a sorry police officer
Just like a man to ask stupid questions at the worst possible time “is the car unlocked” “is there somebody in there?” dumbass pull the handle?! The fuck is anyone supposed to know if it’s unlocked?!? And the boys just told you him mama is in there!!! Why you asking if someone is in there?!? Just get in there. That cop didn’t save anyone
She should not have a drivers license if she does. Thank goodness she’s okay, and thank you men for being men❤❤❤
Amen thank you people for helping & sharing 🙏🙏 keep up with helping ❤
If you don't think God is real watch again
This is what I imagine cops was like up until I was about 10 years old. Heroes
It the car unlocked  wtf
Poor baby... I pray his mom is OK 🙏🏾
STOP ASKING PLEASE!!!!!! EVERY SECOND COUNTS!!!!!
Stupid police asking if “somebody in there “
God bless and prosper you 3 HEROS well, AMEN ❤😊🙏
Thank you Jesus for the God Samaritan Policeman.
That cop was slow asf
🙏🏾❤
Do you see how he’s taking his time coos don’t care about us, the little boy is screaming someone is in there and he’s asking stupid ass questions!
I am glad a wonderful person rescued her. God bless you all 🙏
Cop didn't seem to urgent at all
There was someone already in the water trying to save her.... not asking questions.... can we get his name???
Thank you God for bringing them all in her path at that moment....
😢😮 really? Someone in there! It's funny went they want to break a window they do it real quick. I GUESS THEY WANT HER ORGANS!
incompetent out of shape public tyrant on looking while others do his job and pay his salary as usual hero’s that’s a joke !!!
Standing there yelling is anyone in the car after the kid said she has seizure is crazy!!!
😢🙏🏾
He took forever to actually get in the damn water.
What do you mean is she in there . Like move with a quickness her life was on the line . The kid thinking and moving faster then rescue
THE BOY JUST CONVEYED THE EXACT SCENARIO IN THE MOST UNDERSTANDABLE WAY, what a great son mamas got, she raised him right prayers she’s okay for her baby
That poor baby 😢
When one wants to save, they have to know how things work ......opening the door would have caused an instant flooding inside the car, and the death of the lady for suffocation
"My Mom help her"...OMG I almost cried
The little boy is traumatized.  The cop is a Blessing even if it is his job to serve and protect.  God is good!!!
Don't rush
can’t put my phone down,i  have to get the video for them views that’s how i am going to get my reward on youtube .
“Is somebody in there” man if you don’t get tf in the water in check smh…
Funny how slow they working to save his black mother
The cop is like should I arrest this little black man or get wet?!?!?
Damn. You can tell that kid was running down the street for a while looking for someone to help
Thank you lord for jis quick response. His mom had a seizure. You did get honey.
God please be with this family
Wow 😢
Oh dear lord my heart 😮‍💨 that poor boy he had the face of panicked, scared, worried, frightened all emotions I so wish no child should ever have to experience but I know it’s inevitable!  Thank goodness for the rescuers ❤I pray she fully recovered and her child healed from this scary situation.
Dios gracias. Tu poder es infinito.
Did he just ask if anyones in there and if the car is unlocked?😮
🙏🏽👑🩸🔥🙏🏽
I’ll be honest from my perspective that cop took his sweet ass time trying to get this lady out of the car. He could’ve ran right over and started trying to the back door. See if they open he just kept saying is anyone in there? Is anyone in there over and over and then took his sweet time getting her out
Oooh God thank you for sending rescue in the form of people. Thank u officer and unknown Samaritan. God is good, and young man I pray comfort for you and mom 🫶🏾🙏🏾
Lord thank you for everyone involved. To God be the glory.
Shouting is somebody in the car and the car is under water did he expect to hear an answer
Listing to that body cam, That cop is simply stupid.....
❤❤❤🙏Hero
You are such a brave young man! And thank God you found a fabulous police officer who’s stepped up and did everything he could to help you save your mom! I hope she is doing well and is getting ready to come home soon.
Is the officer slow??? He told you numerous times she was in there and she had a seizure. Im glad she was rescued in the end. However time is everything
How many times was that cop going to ask?!
You were already told someone was in there!!!
"Is there somebody in there?" The kid literally told him someone was in there when he flagged him down. What a dumb turd.
Could he take any longer.
Well if that damn cop would have had sum get up & go instead of slowly asking questions & finally slowly walking to car.    Jerk of a cop that should of ran as soon as kid yelled help
I used a crane strap and drug a pickup out of a canal in Kerman CA once when an old man had a heart attack
Pray God this boy and his momma are alright.
😢😢 God bless them that scared me just hearing that boy cry for help for his mother.
Amazing world guys ❤
Lmao probably drunk
weird cop
What an awful experience for that kid to see his mom in that situation. But luckily he was there to help.
Why tf didn’t he rush in…?  Ain’t no reason to be so hesitant to approach… Yeah, could be an instance of drug use, but the kid indicated she has a history of seizures. Not to mention… even if she was on drugs, it’s better to have a black eye and scratches than see a woman lose her whole damn life.
Thank God he could get help. God bless the rescuers and the victims' families.
That cop is absolutely worthless - he's slow and ignorant
DAMNIT!!!.... Did momma live or not!? Please say she did!!
That cop neglected in so many ways... Someone dying inside the car and the cop is chill AF😡
Jeez, take your sweet time
Thing is the cop went to see what was going on.  Look to All this is what THE MOST HIGH GOD PUT IN PLACE YOU MUST REPECT THAT.. GOOD POLICE OUT HERE STILL IVE MET SOME D.O.T AND REGULAR COPS .. HELL COP IN MARYLAND TOLD ME LAWS I DIDN'T KNOW AND I WAS WRONG
The officer sure wasn't in a hurry tho
Damn he took him forever
Thank god for their help
Yes.. a cop hesitated to go in the water.. wth.. Is there somebody in there? WTH.. the desperation on that kid n begs weren't enough..
Bless y’all❤
White men saved black life and they keep on hating us.
This dude they're so scared to death about every movement they make that they can't even trust a child screaming to save their mother's life... lawless merica you know who truly needs help if you actually have eyes to see but I got a bunch of grown blind men who could never Minister thanks to the Catholics freaks each one of you should be able to minister to your families but but you don't that's why we've got this tribal confused why me mess lefties righties don't be tribal read your Bible Little Buddies
cop didnt do a THING, useless, and corrupt is all. JUMP IN THE WATER AND SAVE HER ISNT THAT WHAT UR JOB IS?!? INSTEAD HE WALKED IN ALL SLOW WITH NO CARE. PATHETIC
I pray she was ok😢
🙏🙏🙏❤️
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Cop sounded clueless and in NO RUSH to help after the kid just clearly explained the situation!  Unbelievable!… “Is someone in there?” “Is the car unlocked?” 🤷🏻‍♂️
Kid is freaking iut because his mom is in a sinking car. Cop has 20 questions.
I just hate ppl who perpetuate racism but don’t highlight the greatness we can be together
Thanking God For Them All 🙌 🙏 That She's Ok
Everybody in this comment section saying that he saved her he saved her we don't know if she lived through it or not or how long she was submerged under the water having a seizure sucking water into her lungs and she looked pretty lifeless to me anybody with some updated information could greatly help out
Damn she had a seizure at the wrong time and placed glad she’s okay 🙏
DRINKING AND DRIVING DON'T MIX .
Dude, this gave me shivers… saw myself in that little boy’s face… running down the street, 8yrs old-puking halfway there from the nerves, to get my grandparents after my sister split her head open and my mom sent me running for help (31yrs ago now and this brought it back like it was yesterday)…. Kudos to all of you for staying on task in this difficult, trying situation. 🙏🏽 I hope everyone is well.
Great job little man for gerting your mother help!!
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO AS A PERSON SAVED HER, WHAT MATTERS IS SHE WAS SAVED AND THAT LIL BOY KNOWS KINDNESS FROM COPS AND PEOPLE, SO HE KNOWS THERE IS GOOD IN THE WORLD..
As a mother with epilepsy, and my mother had epilepsy also. I choose not to drive, it has to be an absolute emergency in order for me to drive. God bless this woman and her brave son 🙏❤ Also thank you to the person for the update.
Really is she in there? That’s what he said he’s not even running what’s wrong with this cop
So sad. 🙏
Good Samaritan? He was casually strolling to ..do his job.
Even now faced with what the entirety of what the position of a cop intales and still that tone in his voice like hes angry and wants to arrest everybody and then their surprised or angry that the public hates them 🤨
Jesus.
God save her
Anybody else slap they face when he asked," is anybody in there" like bro, that boys cries should have been enough for you to know and leap in and help. What, afraid to get a little wet?
Feel so bad for that kid that honestly made me sad the pure scared
I hate people that hate all cops. By far the majority of them are doing an impossible job for the right reasons.
How in the world do people with a seizure disorder get a driver's license
Dios mio los momentos que paso este niño fue horrible😢
Thank you
Cop was moving too slow. A few asked me if you see somebody telling you that someone had a seizure and is in the water. Why approach the car so slow the cop should not be the only one getting credit for this rescue.
Why didn’t the cop just jump in the water instead of just asking questions. People ask to many questions some times. I’d just run up to the car ready to save someone. Maybe that’s a bad thing ?
Thank you all for saving 🙏
Jesus loves you❤
When I saw this on the morning news the other day I was crying from deep down in my soul and praising God that the officer was where God appointed him to be at that time. 🙏🏿
🙏🏾
The anxiety I felt watching this video 😮
Ya no hurry 😮 jus keep asking questions 😡
The kid is yelling my mom is in there why would the cop consistently yell out is it someone in there
Apparently if you guys read someone who updated I'll add this towards the top The mother was I guess in a coma she's been weaned off the ventilator. This was bad. And if you pay attention it wasn't the cop that saved her It was a Samaritan and her son. Also everybody by yourself that little mechanism that will pop your window open and cut your seat belt they're like a buck. I'm now going to add them in the backseat too
Very surprised to see them in a Dodge Charger.
Cop was way to casual. I know stay calm but damn.
Yes and shes doing so much better today🥰🙌🏼
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Now don't get me wrong here the officer did a good job but it isn't what you would call a "good Samaritan act" as it is is his job to do precisely what he did.   A good Samaritan is some one who does a good deed for someone in need and did not have to.  For that matter one should remember the issue of class as it relates to the story as well.   It would be more of a good Samaritan  scenario if it was some meth addict that came running to help😂
Poor little guy.  Hope they were all ok
How frightening for the young boy...Glad she was saved...❤
That sure is hell didn't get in no hurry.
i could be wrong but i heard somewhere that cops aren’t supposed to go into water they’re supposed to call in and wait for professional divers for their safety. if that’s true this is pretty sweet
That cop doesn't understand English?? Or does he have hearing or comprehending issues ?? The boy said she is having a seizure and is drowning!! Tf
What a smart, fast acting son!
This cop represents most cops. Yet, the marxist left wants you to hate them and want to defund them
What happened with her. She make it?? The poor boy
Cop dint even Wana get in the water
Poor little man was so distraught
God bless this baby's heart ❤️ 💙
The child in the water before the officer???? What the actually fuck!!!!!!!!
Another cop asking stupid questions.  He was not eager to save that woman life 😮
Update
👍🙏
Cop slow as hell
Post vax shot, a lot of this is happening while driving and pilots.
That cop literally asked “anyone in there" After the boy said that his momma was in there drowning
😢 Him crying out "Mama!" Instant tears.
😢😢
🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤
That cop moving slow af. If it weren’t for the other dude this lady would have surely died.
That poor baby! 😢😢😢😢
Im sorry.  But, this cop had no motivation.
The panic in that little boys voice breaks my heart. I hope him and his mom are okay.
Modern day cars all have electric windows and locks which means they short out and you cannot open doors or windows. Had known two girls that drowned in nineties due to thos problem. Everyone needs to carry a window/belt cutter hammer. Worth lives.
Just imagine people  talking about defunding the police, get the f*** out of here!
People are trying to make it like the cop didn't want to help her and was basically forced to.  Want to point something out.  They have southern accents and that is water you cannot see the bottom of.  For those of you that know, you know where I am going with this.  There are more dangers with water in the South than in the north, so dont automatically assume life fits your narrative...
This is how helpful i thought most cops were like growing up
May Allah bless the rescuers
Jesus! I hope and pray this young man’s mother is well. Just seeing this broke my heart, thank God for the cops who helped out
That cop did not want to get in that gator water.
The child had already said his mom was drowning but the man kept standing around asking the same question. 😬
Great kid, saved her by getting help quickly when seconds mattered.
Prayers up for momma's health... blessings to you all!!
It sounds like their may be an older Daughter there too ..the one shouting "my mum, help her" sounds different to the little boy.
Smh why is this cop asking dumb questions! Glad that other guys was there to start the process fr
Deep
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
The boy did a great job telling the officer what was wrong. The officer also deserves recognition for getting the mom out of the car and onto land. ❤❤❤❤
Why is he asking if someone is in there after the child just told him his mom was still in the car.   He would've let her die if there were no other people around.   He wasn't trying to get wet
There's a STAR MAN waiting in the sky🎶🎶🎶
With the sad sht u hear on the news, this touches my heart. Blessings sir ❤
Hero child.
Is no one gonna acknowledge how the kids screaming? She’s in there and he’s asking someone in there do your job better bro obviously there’s someone in the car.
Some people in these comments are assholes it doesn’t matter who did more it was about her son getting a cop and the mother was saved.
Bless his 💜 he is so terrified 😢. Thankfully they were able to get his Mom out.
Thanks to the rescue people helping that woman 🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
How did the kid get out,or did this happen close to where the kid was & saw it happen,anyway glad to read it ended okay. ✌
Nunca olvidemos: con la misma medida que medimos a los demás seremos medidos, Solo El Señor Jesús conoce los pensamientos y el  ❤️ del ser humano
We all we got this world. We must treat each other like we want to be Treat it
😢😢😢😢❤️❤️❤️❤️
That cop was jot in a rush to save anyone
I appreciate the calmness of the rescuer...you have to have nerves of steel not to panic!
"is somebody in there?" 😑 After the poor boy just said "my mom had a seizure & she sunk in the water!" 😑 Did he really expect for her to answer his question from UNDER the water???!!! 🙄 Thank God she was rescued but dang, it sure seemed like the cop was taking his sweet time!
Once the little boy said my mom is in the car the way that the cops stood there and start asking is she in there and the little boy crying out help her and he's still yelling at the car completely lets me know his ass had no concern about her life. He probably didn't until the other Good Samaritan hopped in because it took him way too long to go into action.
What a blessing. ❤
Merci pour avoir donné des nouvelles de cette maman et son fils . 🙏🙏🙏👍👏🇫🇷
Hope everyone is safe ❤
Thank god she's ok god bless that little boy. Thanks to all who help to save her god bless
personally I hear a cop and good person helping and NOT becoming hysterical. they are all Heros in my opinion
That poor boy!  His fear was heartbreaking. I choked up.
Call toll truck  and stop waisting quality time, trying to open door.😅
The fact that the officer took so long... Fucking disgraceful. That poor baby. I genuinely hope she's ok... This is heartbreaking as hell...
The little boy is so brave good for him for not giving up
Omg thats scarry.😱😱😱😭
Cops become so neutral to death, you can see in this video the officers drive to save the woman is not very high. Sad to see honestly, because i believe in people and those people sometimes are police officers
Look how slow he moving. Very unprofessional.
Just heartbreaking! I hope the boy and his mother are okay and recovering from this traumatic experience.
😢
That woman had 3 angels that day. ❤
Poor baby he's gonna be traumatized from this😮
What a idiot cop asking if someone is inside hello didn't the baby just told you she inside the car sinking 🤦‍♀️
That poor baby! The panic in his voice, the look of sheer terror in their voice. I don't known if I'm just getting old, but that was heartbreaking. Thank GOD they were able to rescue her.
Why is he so sloww ?
God Bless that young man, i pray his Family is safe and doing well today 🙏
God bless that little boy
Anyone else got frustrated because he wasn't acting quick enough??
Nice rescue
Yeah this got me ! Praise God this lady is ok from the comments 🙌🏾 🙏🏾
❤
Thank Jesus that her son flagged down help and they got her out. Thank you Heavenly Father for your mercy on her life. God bless all of you. Many prayers for that family. 🙏🙏🙏❤️
love how the cops goes “is there anyone in there” and expects a response when the women is literally sunk underwater like the boy already explained.
Good people  out there ❤❤❤❤❤
That poor little boy 😭 my heart breaks for him, what a terrifying and traumatizing situation
He wanted to be sure that ahe was still in the car before he unnecessarily jumped in the water. He didn't know if she got out between the time the boy stopped him and they got to the car!  As someone said, there was a good Samaritan there as well. For all he knew , they may have already taken her out.
Lord, she had a seizure at the wheel. That happened to a parent waiting in the pickup line at a school I was working at. The line was moving up, but her car hadn't moved. The parent in the car behind her, got out and found her. Fortunately,  her daughter hadn't come out of the school yet. This poor child. ☮️❤️🙏🏾
The cop taking to long for me if it was a white person he wouldn’t even keep asking the son if she’s in the lake 😂
Poor baby.. I can’t imagine how afraid he was. 😢
His Mom needs a guard dog to warn of seizures!!!
LOOK AT GOD. PRAISE HIM SHE'S ALRIGHT. THANK U FOR SENDING UR ANGELS
Brave young boy couldn't talk and help his moma😊❤🎉🎉🎉🎉 God bless him
why is the cop asking if someone is in there after the son told him his mother was in there? duh duh
Jesus Jesus Jesus! All I can say..
How the fk did that happen.  You have to be so bad at lifez w t f
What’s with the delay and double ask and lack of urgency or preparation when the kid already said?!?
Thank you Sir’s for helping her.
Legally she's not supposed to be driving if she suffers from seizures for this reason right here such a brave son .
Damn there’s some good men out there ❤ thank you 😢
Damn move faster!!!
Oof enough to make a grown man cry seeing a child in that much distress
“Is there someone in that car?”……………  This is why people hate police and drs. You can tell them EXACTLY what’s going on and they will still be clueless with no sense of urgency. Wasting time and asking non sense questions. Every second and minute counts when it comes to saving lives.   90% of the time this is the reaction of your so called “heros”. They act as if they already have the answer and that you shouldn’t be frustrated or panicking like someone is dying.    How many times have you repeated your case to a cop or doctor under an emergency situation ?
"my moms in there! Shes in the water!!" Cop not wanting to get wet, shouting at a woman drowning: "is somebody in there? Is somebody IN there?"
Im so grateful there was someone already there helping if this cop didn’t come alone I don’t know if that poor man could’ve done it on his own and bless her poor son he was in a panic about his mommy I can’t blame him can you 😢 thank the Lord she doing well . Your all true hero’s I mean the old cop was a little slow but than again we only needed the man power . 💪🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
She is underwater and he asked if anyone is in there? She gonna scream yes?
That cops lack of urgency is evil
Bless this young man and his family❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
God bless that child and officer.  Hope his mom made it 😢
Good samaritan? thats how people perceive police now. they are there to protect and serve its their job to save. ppl are dumb. a officer that wont do this shouldn't be a police officer
I don't know the whole situation but I truly hope she didn't know about her seizure condition. If she did and she still drove that is selfish and dangerous. Especially with her child in the car. I'm glad everyone is ok.
Electric Windows and Locks are a Danger and the Car Companies do nothing about it...Once the battery is submerged all power is gone...
He was dying just getting help!!!
Oh my heart breaks for that child. I can’t imagine going thru that as an adult. That child is a real life super hero.
🙏 🙏 🙏
This is why my husband won't let me drive he is terrified I could have frontal lobe seizure while driving. I read in the comments that someone said she was okay but she still on icu.
The lack of a sense of urgency in that officer is gross.
Thanks guys..
got a kid begging to help saying someones in there and u question that as a officer
Police king of slow ❤
That poor baby! thank god someone drove by. This was heartbreaking to watch. I could feel his terror and desperation for help. Sweet boy
I am glad those peoples' life paths crossed that day. It took all of them to save just one. 😮 Praise God.
Cop moving little to slow
How is a cop doing his job a good Samaritan? We shouldnt be surprised by this they get trained to know life saving techniques. Ues appreciate he was able to and the severity but not a special situation its literally wjat he said he would do for his job.
Poor baby. He will see this for the rest of his life. I pray that they get him into therapy asap. He is a super Hero!
His ass asking questions instead of moving quickly!!! If a panicked child told you she sunk, why are you asking questions??
Omg as someone who has a history of seizures, this broke my heart. May God heal the mother and be with the young man.
I like how he nonchalantly walks down like this isn't a damn emergency or something. Just taking my time....
On God bro just stood there
America needs to see some of the good that police officers do in the communities they work in. There are horrible cops, but the good outweigh the bad. We need the good ones to step up.
Praise to all helped🙏🙏❤❤
Than̈kyou gentleman for be a blessing the helping to save there lives
Omg 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😇 thank yall
Praises be to God❤
❤❤son is hero ...sheer terror but saved momma's life. Why do cops not believe people anymore? We are all better off asking strangers for help and doing it ourselves !!! He finally got into action. Just sad😅😅How many times does he have to shout help her!!??? He just went in and saved his mom and finally the cop believed him!!!
That poor boy is so scared for his mama. 😢
Do not drive your children around or operate a vehicle if you have a seizure disorder!!!!!
Thanks to the boy and the cop for saving that woman.
Congratulations Texas PD
I'm teared up right now. Thank God for these 3 for saving  her life.🙏🙌
Praise God  They Got her out Amen Amen God bless the young man he saved his mom's life thank the officer and God bless his ❤🙏😔🙏😔❤.
That white cop did not want to save that woman
Is she in there? Is somebody in there? Seriously??? 🤦🏿🤦🏿 I just can't. Thank God there were other people around. Reading the comments makes me happy knowing she and her son will see better days 💕🙏🏿
I am so glad they were able to save her. Her poor son. I pray he isn’t traumatized from this experience.
I just wanted to Thank You Heavenly Father our Lord and Saviour for sending someone to help don't care about the color of their SKIN I PRAY ALL IS WELL 💯🙏💖🙌🙏💜🙏🥰
Thank you God for this child fortitude in getting help & these brave souls providing it without hesitation. Bless them all including the victim bountifully & allow them always to continue to be the much needed such of this earth 💖🙏
I'M SITTING HEAR WITH MY HEART POUNDING YELLING GET GET HER HURRY UP GET HER
Thank you Jesus
Thank you, God, for sending the right people at the right time.  That young man needs his momma. 😢 🙏
Damn cop can you take your time a little more
What's with the thousand questions before helping? She's drowning!
No sense of urgency at all
The cop needs training...
Proud of everyone good job the big god is real ❤❤❤
How did the boy get out? He's a smart and brave kid. ❤
Before we knew my husband was hypoallergenic and seizure prone one morning he took our 6 yr old son our 5 yr old daughter and 10 day old new born baby girl and strapped them into truck. 3 blocks from home he started having a seizure at the wheel he hit a PowerPoint with foot on full gas head on. They hadn't been gone 4 minutes and I get a phone call telling me my husband just hit a pole head on. I ran there barefooted I didn't recognize the truck. And didn't see my family. BY THE GRACE AND MERCY OF GOD, my husband was in the ambulance he was injured pretty bad but he would leave the hospital with me that day. You guys ALL 3 OF OUR BABIES were inside someone's home right on the seen and our son had a cut on his chin. Other then that our babies were not hurt AT ALL. I thought I had just lost my whole family when I seen that truck. Bur God wrapped his arms around them and they lived. That was 15 years ago and I still have my husband and we have our babies..now thier grown. God's work
I Thank God every day for the miracles. 💯❤️ for you son.
Lets us (praise)Jesus now!!!! Thank you God for everyone involved. Good Samaritans. Brave/loving son.👋👋👋👋👋👋💯🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃😇😇😇😇😇🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️🤧🤧🤧👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Young man said she’s having a seizure Lord Jesus broke my heart. 🥺
The camera man was there ready with an underwater camera. Interesting. Very helpful.
Honestly that cops sense of urgency was like 2% when it should of been 300% “is somebody in there?..” god damn man
The child tells the cop My MoMS  IN THERE, AND HE Yells,  IS SOMEBODY In THERE?? THE BOY HAD TO "TELL HIM TO HELP HER!!! THE COP IS A MORON!!!
Poor kid had to get out of that car alone, to save his mum 😢
Why did they open booth go in that way
Real men who stand and serve!❤😊
Yelling “is somebody in there”? Do you think that baby is lying? And do you expect to hear her yelling under water or that she can hear you?
Heart wrenching,  proud of her son ❤
The little boy was the only one putting effort into saving her… imo the cop didn’t seem to want to
🙏♥️
Thank you Jesus they were both ok❤.
Is she in there? He's taking his sweet ass time
Why is he asking if someone is  in there when he was already told that she’s in there… also, why is he moving so slow to her.. to the door to her her out! It’s plain as day that whomever odd in there is submerged!!!! Move quickly!!! Sheesh stressed me out… if it were his mom he world move faster…
He didn't seem too pressed
Why is the cop asking is someone in the car when the child already told him??? Just save her 😮😮😮
Poor little guy, my heart.. i pray they save her...❤
'Is she in there?!' Dude, that young man TOLD YOU she was..  and why is the cop holding the camera?
🙏🏿🙏🏿
Obviously there is someone in there, the boys is pointing and yelling to help his mom, duh??🙄
Did he drop her in the end back in the water WTF???
I cried through this entire video. That poir brave boy. Did Mom survive?
You can tell that little boy loves his momma so much. ❤ glad to hear she has been weaned off the vent. I hope she fully recovers
Stupid ass cop is somebody in there what
This was so gut wrenching.. I pray she's okay
Good job for that little boy and that orange shirt man for risking it all
Worlds most useless cop!!! Absolutely no sense of urgency!
Sorry but a Good Samaritan Cop is not a thing. The cop was just doing his job.
That dear boy, bless him. So brave to stop another motorist to get help for his mother. A young hero. ❤
Someone get that kid an ice cream and a ps5
This is so distressing! People that suffers with epilepsy/ seizures should not be behind a wheel. This is exactly what could happen.
She should thank God for the child that saved her life
Salute
😱😱🙏🙏🙏🙏
In a situation like this I can't help but point out that the boy was wet telling the officers about his mom's seizure and that she was in the water only to get there and ask if anyone was in the car. Sometimes the obvious in the face of adversity or stress will hinder your ability to react quick enough to respond effectively.
😭😭😭😭hope she's okay!! That poor baby!!! What a good son!!!!
❤
Poor kid. Very scary ❤
❤💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙♥️
Damn! My daughter is epileptic and doesn’t drive. Good reason not to, and for other drivers as well! Of course this is if she has a history of seizures. God bless them! ❤️
Thank you lord
Glad they're all right. Time to stop driving. Can't drive if you know you're prone to having seizures.
That cop made me mad is the car unlocked wtf go in and see to calm for me might as well ask about oil change
GOD Bless All Who's Involved 💝🤗🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼✝️👑
Goosebumps omg 😢
But is she in there
Thank you, Jesus, for these great people.  👍 😊❤.   Good bless this young boy able speak.  Barely could talk.
Is she dead?
Why the hell did he sit on the bank and say is anyone home. Its under water dude😂
Won’t see this on the news because the cops are white
Omg. His franticness hurts my hart. Thank goodness for the one’s that pulled her out
Thank God you guys didn't just stand by.❤ The world needs more people like this.
😢 I hope she is ok now. This kid is a real hero!!
🥺🥺😢
Is it just me or was this cop " dragging" his feet? I watched and felt like he was moving in slow motion in the beginning.
Wish the cop didn't stay so chill for so long, you see a car in a fuckin lake with potentially a person drowning in it and you just stand there and ask nicely "Hey are you in there?" I would be sprinting to that car without a word like did he just not wanna have to get wet if he didn't have to. Show some hustle when the kid next to you is scared their parent is dying.
Oh hope she’s okay! This young kid was brave to go and get help! Thank God!!!and blessing to everyone that helped them!
Qmen
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Glad everything is alright
Well good thing this wasn't an emergency
This guy needs to think a little quicker on his feet
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
poor kid and mom thanks for helping her in Jesus name 🙏 amen
Holy lackadaisical going to try and save her. Like get your *** moving holy crap.
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Police doing job.this is weird
Is someone in there, wow this cop is dumb
What people forget is, water is heavy.  Trying to open a car door under water is pretty much impossible.
Why the ef is the police taking his time to get her !!!!😡😡😡😡
The cop acted like he didn’t want to get in the water, saying is anyone in there and knowing damn well the little boy just said my Mama’s having a seizure and she’s in the water 🤷🏻‍♂️ Praying for her 🙏🏻
I pray she's OK. But I have seizures andvrefuse to drive because this could happen, or worse. People who have seizures should not be allowed to drive
Useless cop. Probably was taking his sweet time waiting for her to drown, so he can get some extra points with the brotherhood of police (you know, the whole sacrificing and mu rde ring people for power)
That's good for the kid to get help and got a hold of the cop. That was brave and a super hero. What amazing cop to go into the water and the other cop/gentlemen that helped to get that little boys mom out.
I missed that he asked the kid to hop in.. I’m assuming he gave him a ride back to the car
😢❤
❤️‍🔥LORD❤️‍🔥JESUS❤️‍🔥CHRIST❤️‍🔥🔊🔊🔊🙏
Both of them are Heroes God bless them ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Did he save her???
He could’ve moved a little faster js
Sweet child. Bless them.
Cop takes his time miracle she still alive 🙏
That’s exactly why we must find our police again properly. We need to build better communications with our communities and the law enforcement that provides for. It! I wish this officer, the best of fortune, in all his endeavors!
Thank God for mercy,and courage over the kid.
Thank you to everyone who participated in the help and rescue of this boys mother and to the EMS and to the hospital staff it took a village and her son deserved to see the village worked for his family! God blessed you all! Love and hugs!❤
He told her so many time my God with that kid for having to go through that. Then when other help arrives her wants them to hurry like the women kid dint say that at first.  😮😮😮
The rules. Guns are always loaded. Submerged cars are always occupied.  His partner must’ve run straight to the submerged car, while he told the kid to hop in and gave him a ride back. I missed that the first time.   Yes, apparently they did save her. But his partner got her out.
Cop is just chillin not helping… “is she in thar”. PLEASE HELP MY MOMMA!!! “damit son, is she in thar”. “Is she in thar”
Is there no regulations on issuing a driver's license to people that are at risk of seizures?
Poor baby 😢😭🙏🙏🙏
that little boy is the HERO. The bystander is a HERO & FANTASTIC EXAMPLE OF WE THE PEOPLE - PRAISED BE. THE COP. did his job. caught a pay check for said job with reasonable associated benefits. let's praise the right people.
God bless all who were involved! The rescuers and the victims! Hope she'll have a full recovery!🙏
A few years ago the woman was saying "Defund the police !!! "
Zoti e shpërbleft dhe ket zyrtar policie .shpëtoi ☝️🤲🤲
reluctantly saves woman.,😮
Officer slow af
The fact that the child emphasized "she's having a seizure" also helped in her rescue/recovery. Being pulled out of a drowning car and set down in front of a ton of flashing lights, will not have benefited her brain function.
🩷... Amen! Amen! Amen!... 🩷
Is anybody in there?  C'mon man
That cops a 🤡
"Is the car unlocked?"  - yeah but I think there's a little water inside, so watch out when you open the door. 🤪
Talk about taking your sweet time!! Kid shows up soaking wet told his mom stuck in the car you show up to the scene still asking questions… WTF!!
People with seizure disorders aren't allowed to drive, so... oh nevermind answered my own question. Glad everyone is okay but the trauma that kid endured will last forever. He will always be on edge every moment waiting for it to happen again. Sad. Hope the mother is responsible.
Merci aux hommes de secours😊😊😊❤❤❤ que dieu les protegent
That poor lady and boy 😭
That baby was so distraught but he did his damnedest to get the info across. I just know he had nightmares from that ordeal. ☹️ I hope he and his momma are doing better now.
God bless that police officer and the lady he rescued ❤✝️✝️
😢😢
Nothing but God.
❤caballero mil gracias por ayudar a el niño y a quien esta el autor todavía hay personas buenas Bendiciones..
You can't open the door until it is filled with water because of pressure, looks like electric windows as well.
Kinda pissed me Off when he asked the flooded car was there someone in there 😂
Thank God 🙏🙏
🫴🏿💚🙏🏿🕊❤ please stop driving Mom!! You are Needed and Loved!! Love & Light!!
God bless them both.  The child and the gentleman.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wow ❤
Please 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
Thank you God I love you
Why is no one talking about the indifferent, lethargic response of the officer. You'd think he was stepping into the hotel swimming pool when the water was a little cold. No urgency whatsoever 😡
That cop should be fired how fucking SLOW he was moving. What a joke
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😭
I hope the mother is okay🙏🙏❤️❤️
I swear. Yes thanks to all involved in rescuing this woman/family and the cop is a hero either way!!! Along with EMS and everyone else. Thank you for your service officer. Prayers for the little boy that must've been traumatic.
Horrifying!
All due respect to cops but the cop wasn't a good Samaratan, he was doing his job. Big respect to the women's son for going all out to get help. Thank God.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is one of my worst fears... accidentally driving my vehicle off the bridge into a body of water.
That cop didn't giv a fck
Thank God they saved his Momma. He needs her in this messed up world where cops are not appreciated anymore, even for doing something good! I bet the little boy was thankful and not full of hate like some of you on this post! What a shame!
Did you really need to ask if someone was in there and if the car was unlocked? Get in the fucking water dude someone’s dying in there.
People with seizures or epilepsy are not allowed to have a driver's license because of this
Great police work.  That is public service! However,  help help help, help my mum!!!! YOU help her!!!!!!  You are taught to run away when a school shooter is around but you are not taught  C.P.R. or any type of survival skills. But to be fair,  he is very young and in a panic.  He flagged down a police car,  saved his Mum.  Full respect 🙏  what a wonderful young man
That kid just broke me for the day 😢. I hope mom will be okay 💔
Omg having a seizure too 😢❤ scary
That was a very slow response on the police officer
I can’t watch a kid panic and be in distress like that, it just kills me that I’m through a screen and can’t reach out to help him.
I hope his Mom was alright.
Praise the Lord for the man to stop and rescue his mom Thank you Jesus I pray she lived
He likes is one in there
God bless this child 🙏 and the ppl that helped saved her officer went in with everything on didn't care if he mashed up his equipment thank there r some gd officers out there still
Hats of to the  man who was able to rescue this kids mother.
“Is there anybody in there” MY MAMA MAN
The cop is like damn I have to get wet for a N word
Brave boy!!
I love how the cip wanted to make sure before he got his clothes wet
The cop is 🗑️
This video pissed me off. Who supposed to be the professional and who's the child. Bcz I couldn't tell. Comes like the child has more since then the cop. He truly didn't save her at all. The kid saved his own mother. This child is the only Hero I can see. Cop needs immediate trainings...
That  cop acts like he didn't want to get wet😮
BUT.. BUT... THE NEWS SAID COPS ARE RACIST
Thank God, a young hero❤🙌🙏
God is Good
God bless all who helped this family!!!❤🙏🏻🙌🏻🙏🏻🙌🏻🙏🏻🙌🏻🙏🏻✝️💜💛💜💛💜💛💜
This cop has no sense of urgency lol
New fear having a seizure while driving
That cop waited long enough to start rescue. Fkn fg
This is what humanity is❤
These cops show you what it is to be a real police officer. He took that job for the right reasons.
That cop moved in slow motion . He was acting like he didn’t care or like if it wasn’t important to him . 🤦‍♂️
The way he was moving I thought he was going to get a Donut first.   No urgency at all
Thank you officer! God bless you and that poor little boy. I hope mama recovered.
Good son
Surprised this didn't make the news.  I guess its not promoting fear, terror and hate.  The good in people need to be promoted to save humanity in this society
GOD WAS WITH THEM ALL THAT DAY.  AND FROM NOW ON ❤❤🙏🏼🙏🏼😇😇
Omg
How many times was he supposed to say his mom sunk ?? “Is someone in there” like tf
See they're  good Cops out there.  Thanks WOPD.
Such a brave boy, you saved your mommas life sweetheart, well done mama you raising your boy the right way, bless you both ❤
Love the Cops 💕💕 G9DS Creations..Humans😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
Coo was slow asking dumb questions
Thank God for this man ❤
🙏 ❤❤❤
😢🙏
Brave kid got her the help she needed! Kudos to the cop for listening to him and getting her out.
You  don’t know how to swim
God Bless our First Responders and their bravery.
Wow…what is scary is this is real time..movies give us such a false sense of running your car into water. So many things could happen and if you’re not totally lucid when you’re going under, you’re probably it getting out alive unless you’re very quickly rescued. Even then, you’re going to be    go unconscious and drown.
Never defund our police officers ❤. Thank God for this precious boy who knew how to ask for help.🙏✝️☝️
The cop did poorly in my eyes. Whata waiste of a human.
If she’s drowning how she suppose to answer ?!? he was suppose to jump in the water…too slow to my liking.  I mean he was calm which was excellent but I didn’t sense the urgency on his reaction
There are a few good officers who are out there saving lives as opposed to the GANG of them who are solely intent on taking lives....Thank You! Sir....🙏🏽
True,and that is common sense.thank u.🤨
Kindness
I dont like this cop at all... his whole attitude was not severe enough for the situation. He didnt run at the car when he arrived he waddled towards the car asking if anyone was in there... wow imagine asking that in that situation
Why ask if there's anyone in there if the kid said his mum stuck
I think Laberrick has to take her to court to defend himself against Destiny’s antics. It may be challenging for her to find employment now with her background. Fame chasing is a helluva drug!
THAT YOUNG MAN, GOD BLESS HIM, ALONG WITH ANOTHER MAN & THE POLICE, THANK GOD FOR ALL OF THEM!! THEY ALL SAVED THEIR LIVES.
Why are people so incompetent smh
God bless you for saving her ❤️😭🙏
Thank God for all the heroes who saved this young lady especially her child
Slow response from officer when there’s a person drowning. “Is there someone in there?” “Is the door unlocked?”. Get TF in there and help lol
Thank everyone that helped save this lady. God bless you all. ❤
He’s really gotta tell the cop MULTIPLEEEEE TIMES TO HELP HER LIKE WTFFFF . Seriously wtffff… THAT BOY WAS THE HERO , the cop was a lame ass .
Godbless all you guys
King u  r brave how u saved ur mother's life , n u knew just what 2 do, GOD BLESS UR FAMILY ❤❤❤❤❤
Bruh, no offense but the kid is clearly old enough to know he could've saved her himself. Like come on....
😢thank GOD that her son was able to get help IN JESUS CHRIST NAME. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Poor baby.. in that moment he must’ve been so scared. I’m glad his mom made it. I pray she has a full recovery and son is doing well.
That just ripped my heart
Not being hateful. At all. But i am a firm believer that ppl who suffer epilepsy or seizures should NOT be allowed to operate vehicles. She went into the water this time. The next time it could be a vehicle with children.i do pray shes ok though.
Thank you for those who helped 🙏🏽my God!  Please father cover the young boy and family along with the law enforcement officers, EMT .  There’s still good people in the world that wants to help!!❤
God bless all involved
Praying for her and her family God bless those who were there to hel 🙏❤️🙏
For this sweet baby boy my heart almost burst hearing his cries for help. I couldn’t fathom how scared he was in hopes of getting help for his mother! GOD THANK YOUUU for sparing her life. And allowing her to have a brave son!
Prayers sent Thankyou young man Hope you and the person in the car are well and are recovering 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
The Mother had a SEIZURE 😮😮😮❤❤
I think the cop was perhaps in a bit of initial shock as well he kept asking if anyone was in there while the little boy was telling him his mom was in there. Once he could actually comprehend what he was hearing what a real life hero ❤
Omg.. hearing him call for his mama pulled at my mommy heart strings. I just want to hold him and tell him it's all gonna be okay. 😢❤
Look how long it took him to get in the water talk about protect and serve
Great job all!! People get a life and complain about something important, gas prices, food prices, corrupt government 🙄🙄
😮❤
This cop took to damn long askin to many questions
God Thank you for the little boy and those two men being in the right place at the right time ❤
It's good to hear the update. Most times nothing is said so we are left worried and wondering what happened.😊💜
To all involved god put you where you needed to be to save the mother, you all are heros, prayers for the family for a full recovery!!!!
He was moving like a 🐢. RUN SIR! RUN
What do you mean is somebody in there? Get in there and find out. There's no time for asking questions. How are they going to answer him in that situation? 🤔
How come they had time to record this
I feel like she was doing sum dodge owner stuff is what led to this
Brave kid.. well done getting help.
"She sunk! She's in the water!" "Is she in there? Is somebody in there?"  Bruhhhh tf do u think?😮‍💨
God bless ❤
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏... Praying for momma!!!! Hope she's ok.✝️
When every second counts, this isn't the officer you want to respond. Took his sweet time. Heard she was okay though.
That poor child the fear in his voice I'm happy Mom was saved hopefully full recovery no side effects from being under water 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️
Poor baby boy, so glad they all saved her!
I would be very surprised if she lived. She was underwater for a very long time.  If anyone knows what the outcome of this was, please share!
❤❤❤❤
I'm so glad that this little boy was able to escape from the trapped car so that he can get help for his mom🙏😭
💚💚💚💚💚
Taking forever to get you feet wet.😮
So did the boy lock the doors when he got out?
Hero❤
Slowest cop in the world, is someone in there.  He told you 5 times!
The cop is an idiot 😊
She had a seizure, she sunk, she's in the water.... Enough said, little man let's go!!!
God bless him
The cop saying "is anybody in there?".... More then once told me loud and clear HE CANT SWIM. Also asking the traumatized young boy if the car was unlocked. WOW.
Cop had all the time in the world, apparently. He just didn't want to get wet, I guess.
God is good ALL THE TIME
Cop was moving so dam slow smh
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
He done what any child would do for someone they love and thats get help..
Can we just give God praise! He was right there!🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
The cop stood around asking questions because he didn't want to go in the water...
That man is stupid is somebody in their you don't ask somebody is in there you go I guess he's too much of a cat he doesn't want to get wet and want that person to get out that's how I look like in the beginning the way how he acting
Sweet boy. TY you Officer
I bet that water is filled w snakes
Why ask him more than once ??
That poor baby 💔💔💔
Cop did not rescue. Those with eyes can see.
This cop has zero urgency.  This guy sucks
The little guy said, my mom is having a seizure she’s in the car and the cop, wouldn’t take time to listen to the child
That cops lack of urgency is ungodly
Oh she had a seizure
Omg he was traumatized by this. Good that he was able to articulate that his mother needed help.😮
I actually drove past when all of this was happening but im glad she is doing okay
I'm glad she is ok but could that guy be any slower to jump in the water and help this lady oh my goodness it takes second for someone to drown jeeezzz 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
HOW COME HE DIDN'T ASK IF SHE HAD INSURANCE...STUPID ASS COP...!!!
Thank you Lord.
Bless that babies heart
Why u jus standing there asking if she's in there when that Lil kid jus told u she was in there... wtf dude. Pick up the pase like could u move any slower dude
Is she in there?? Really ??? Come on you don’t question you act right away .. good this the person is ok,
Why cops always scared when it comes to saving a person. Yet when it comes to taking a life they never hesitate. 🤡
Ladies if you can't drive fast cars don't get a fast car. I hope she's alright
Bless his heart! Thank you for your bravery.
God bless this young man 🙏 God bless his mother 🙏 God bless the ppl that helped save her life 🙏 Amen
Is she in there its clear that lil man just told you dont wait just go
Sll 3 are heros. Its nice to see s cop protect snd serve. Ty sir.
🙏
Stupid Police is somebody in there?? What??
God bless you bro ✨️ 🙏🏾 🙌 ❤️
Dam God was With Yall💯
sending prayers to help her heal and help her child with the trauma of watching her be trapped in, was just trying to get her out.
This made me cry 😭,but GOD is good I'm glad to know she is ok.
The full report came out. She was high and intoxicated on alcohol when she crashed. There were no signs of a seizure when she was taken to the hospital.
GPS gave her the wrong directions 😂
My heart broke for that boy... Glad to hear Mom is still alive..❤
I’ve nearly drowned before but to have a seizure WHILE drowning…. Wow. I can’t imagine the terror they must’ve felt
That cop was moving a bit to slow for my comfort level. Its like a nightmare where everything is in slow motion.
A real copper. Most police in the uk would wait for fire service.
Is this cop ok asking if the car is unlocked
Goosebumps, just goosebumps 😟
The cop is waiting for the woman having a seizure while underwater to say yes I'm in here and I'm fine please, please. Is the door unlocked so we can easily open the door forced shut by water anyhow. Uhhh! I hope she is well...
That child is an absolute hero. He escaped a sinking car, found help, gave clear and precise information and was first back in the water to help his mom
How do you expect a reply from a submerged vehicle 🤔
Officer wasred time asking questions of someone who was submerged, dang it!🤨
Cop asked more questions then anything
Funny how they never say white cop saves black woman having seizure while son watches.  Cops are basically good people.  Thank you 🙏
What can we say the creator of this infinite universe is always on time with everything he does even the people he says to help!
What kind of idiot keep asking if she is in there don’t he see the situation and the boy just told you she is in the car and that was the slowest I seen someone go in to help like if he was scared of the water jump in to action man
The kid already said she was in there! Why is he asking is somebody in there??? Nevermind… glad she’s ok
The cop really didn’t do anything but hand him a punch and and call ems. The rest was whoever that bad ass dude was and the kid that handled that amazingly. Especially for his age. The cop acted like he didn’t wanna get wet at first.
What a dumb question is anyone in there BOI SHE WAS SCREAMING SO LOUD MATE
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾May GOD  BLESS U ALL N KEEP U SAFE
That cop didn't care lol ..if it was his momma he would.of been rushing
Hope she ok. Scary one ❤
why is he yelling is someone in there?  the little boy had to say help her?
Really the kid says she sunk she's in the car and then he's going to ask is the car locked what in the hell I guess he didn't want to get wet it's sad that cop you're just not slightly walking
Brave young man.
Damn that’s crazy… How are you able to drive and you know you can have a episode at any time. I know it’s nothing new because the kids know about it and that’s by name of the condition. Could’ve killed herself and the kids and somebody else. Regardless is reckless.. but I hope all is well
❤thank you Father God,  AMEN HALLELUJAH.
Did the boy say, "She's having a seizure!"?😮
Likely not 🚫 gone be able to open the door of a vehicle in this situation.....need to break windows if submerged.....bip type tool... bless up 🙏 rescue folks
Get the back windshield, the water is dulling the vibration from the punch.
That cop needs to be fired he took his time then said is she n there smh he suppose to put his cape on n double time someone is dieing n he talking.
Thank god for you god bless you alway❤
This cop was slow ngl
I just love how the cop takes his sweet ass time after the boys desperate pleas for help, but the Samaritan jumps right in and gets to work with no questions or worries about himself
Thank God the police were there to save his mom. I pray she survived and is OK.
Wow. That cop was slow about it ..and why he asking is someone in their that crazy.
Is somebody in there? No response? Aight imma head out.
"is somebody in there?" Are you freaking serious officer? Hope his chain of command had a talk with this goofy
So grateful to this police officer I pray to God for that little boy What a horrible responsibility for such a young child I pray the Lord  This little boy gets the love and compassion and understanding and helpfulness that he needs no little child should have to go through this May Jesus Christ himself help this little boy and his mom and thank goodness for good people who do great things like this officer let us keep this in mind God bless you all
Ol boy could've moved a little quicker.
This is important to people who don't realize window rolled up break hard and under water make it even harder but everyone should knife with a seatbelt cutter and and a widow breaker it happens to often and time is everything. Thank god she was saved 🙏
Heartbreaking to see that beautiful little boy so scared and powerless not able to get his beloved mom out🥺🥺 In Jesus name I pray that they are alright and that she makes it thru this🙏❤️ Poor little boy, I feel so much for him❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is somebody in there?  No it just drove it's self
THANK GOD FOR THAT CHILD AND FOR THE GOOD SAMARITAN AND THE COP, I HOPE AND PRAY THAT HIS MOMMA IS ALRIGHT AND BETTER.
What a good baby boy. ❤
Thank God for good hearted Samaritans
This is how a 20 year old man died right down the road from me. Trying to save a woman and child from the Elk River. He died along with them. Some people might not realize how dangerous this is even from the rescuers position.
THANK GOD THERE WERE PEOPLE THERE TO HELP. THANK YOU JESUS.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
😭😭😭😭😭listening to that poor child asking for help
He ain’t no hero! He took way too long! He definitely didn’t want to get wet! I would’ve dove in there without even asking the boy any questions! Idc if there was no one in there or not! Every second counts in this type of situation no time to ask questions all calm. Foh! Oh wait..maybe just maybe if the boy was white then maybe he would’ve moved faster!
Giving a drivers license to someone who regularly passes out or has seizures, is like giving a drivers license to someone who is blind
How's she operating a vehicle when she has seizure?
I pray that their both alright
Why tf did he hesitate to go in the water and ask if someone was in there after the kid already told him what happened?!?
When time is of the essence, a little more hustle on the cops part would've been a lot more helpful. Kudos for the cop doing his job, but when a child is screaming that his mom is under water, dont ask several times if there is someone in the car! I take my hat off to the man that was actively TRYING to get the woman out of the car. He's the TRUE hero in my opinion. ❤
Is the car unlocked?   . . . . . Do you want me to get you a key cut . . Hang on I've just got a phone call . . 😊.
Thank goodness the young boy came across the cop and saved his mom.
He didn't give a f*ck about her.
The officer is moving sooo slow! It's an emergency and he just standing there asking if someone I'd in there. Smh!!! Glad she is OK. You can have a level head but MOVE FASTER!
Lord have Mercy!!!!     Thank you Jesus help came in time. Hopefully everybody’s OK. Amen.!!!🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Poor young man is having a panic attack trying to help his mom 😢 what a blessing her son is
that policeman is so slow and chilled....🤦🤦
Cop aint shit
From New Zealand 🇳🇿 I bet this officer goes to lunch break faster this shit is unbelievable..I won't comment any further  f....g frustrating watching this hope all is good little man
Why is he yelling "is there someone in there?" Kid just told you?
Ya I was gonna say that cop isn’t a hero a hero wouldn’t be asking questions would have just jumped in the water like the man that just rescued a infant from water I doubt he was asking questions
That poor baby 😢
Who's recording this and why?
I'm sorry but the kid told him before they arrived what was going on and then he gets there and keeps yelling 'Is SoMeBoDy iN tHeRe?? 🥴'
That cop was an idiot! "Is somebody in there",  is the car locked"🤦...If that was me I would have jumped in the water immediately and tried to open or break the window! Sorry ass public servant!! 👎
Thank God that baby ran for help instead of panicking and thank God for the man that stopped and helped they both are heroes thank you God she has a second chance of life 🙏🙏❤️
Thank God!!! God sent  the right person with the right heart to help that precious baby and his mom...
Bout time we see some real cop(JOB) love instead of hate(JOB)
Its a group effort you troll
I am epileptic and in Ontario you have to go 2yrs before you can get your license but I decided when I was a teenager it wasn't worth it because it wasn't just my life it was other people's lives on the roads as well I could unalive!! So if this accident doesn't open peoples eyes that have a seizure disorder I don't know what will!!😢😢
The guy recording did not get in any kind of hurry even after he saw the car under water. Asking are you sure if anyone is in there. While the boy was constantly saying someone was in there. As soon as that boy told him he should of been sprinting . Even while in the water he seems reluctant to help. Am I the only one that sees that????
“ is somebody in there” yes someones in there the little boy just told you now get your ass in the water and help
I’ve had seizures for 30 years and I do not drive. It is a definite hardship to rely on others, but my neurologist made it clear that if I drive with the knowledge that I am not supposed & get into in accident & possibly kill somebody, I would be up on manslaughter charges, it’s one thing to put myself in danger but to hurt someone else or my own child is a whole other situation. I choose not to drive !!
Maybe don’t have seizures when you drive 🤷‍♂️
Cop didn't do anything. Out of shape I bet
Praise God for her son and the man who assisted and kept her son calm. Praise God she's okay ❤
Tbh, if this was Florida I wouldn’t save my own goddamn daughter by getting in that gator pool
Is somebody in there. Well the boy just told u and the girl is calling to her mom in the car. Um yeah I think someone is in there. They will give anyone a badge.
Thank you  Mr police officer FOR SAVEING HIS MOTHER.🇬🇧🇯🇲
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
@tamerinhall @jhud
This is why people with epilepsy aren't supposed to drive!
🙏
They won't show this in the media
The point you don't care how cold & wet you'll get, attempting to save a life!
Thank you officer.
Omg this child breaks my heart
Is somebody in there??? Um Sir..... What did the screaming soaking wet child just tell you
❤❤❤❤❤ my God
The point you don't care how cold & wet you'll get, attempting to save a life!
Why is the cop asking if someone in there when the boy already told him his mom is in there. Also, she is having a seizure, so it's not like she can answer. Anyway, I'm glad they all could save her.
God bless this man
I'm  sitting here crying. That young man savet his momma snd his cry for help (help her)😢😢😢.  I hope she is doing well now. God bless.
That cop act like he didn’t give a damn
Watching his face while he was saying she's in the water save her broke my heart and his little face poor baby❤❤😢
Poor kid,hope his mom was okay
These officers like this need to go viral and be rewarded for they brave and equal love for humanity  This officer needs to be famous instead of all the wrong ones
That cop didn’t even seem like he wanted to help.
Wenn jemand schreit Sie ist dort eingeschlossen helft ihr Sie geht unter dann empfinde ich in diesem Moment die Frage ist  da jemand  drin  irgendwie ätzend wie wenn man nen Call in nem Counterstrike gibt und die Position des Gegners sagt und keiner reagiert darauf
Typical woman driver.  Not surprised at all.   They can't make fking toast, why in earth they are driving and voting is beyond me.
Is this Florida?? Cuz MURKY WATER + LILY PADS = GATORS!!!!!! Sorry kid 🏃‍♂️ J/K!!! She's actually OK.  Thank God!!
That is a smart heroic little boy.
Honestly, why ask if anyone is in there if obviously the car is submerged under water...you wasting time.....situational awareness would help a lil more
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mom” I brought you into this world “  Son “ And I will bring you back “ ….
God bless you all she has 3 Amazing heroes 🦸 ❤
IS THAT NOT HIS JOB TO HELP?????
That cop was slow asf
Man fuck asking questions man, get in and help.
Thank you Jesus 🙏
Terrified, he was able to tell them she's having a seizure, and she's stuck in the water. God bless all of them good job.
This breaks my heart everytime, the cry, his face as s he cries of hel for his mom...poor baby, this was so traumatic for him.....God bless his heart and thank God the help was there for them😢😢😢...i hope she'll be ok
Thank God she's ok. Poor kid mom had seizures in front of me that was traumatizing enough but then the car in water 😢
He’s telling the cop she’s in the water. Why does the cop ask if someone is ok there when he gets to the car. Just get in the water man
Thank goodness that she and her child survived. This is why Dr's are suppose to report seizure pts to the DMV.
Why was the police officer asking if anyone was in the car after the child frantically told him she’s having a seizure she’s in the car she’s in the water?
That poor kid. Prayers he realizes what kind of hero he is and isn't traumatized by this.
Poor baby 😢
This is the issue with America and it’s for profit over human rights dmv should not have this women driving I would rather have taxes go to free driver then immigrants
Bet if they were white folks you woulda been running into that water instead of taking your sweet as time
This cop is a liability.....
just need to a search for something like, "texas mom in submerged car rescue",  I found story on gma from August 14, so finding info won't be hard.
💔
yeA she iN THERE!!!
GOD IS GREAT ALL THE TIME 🙌🙏❤️ GOD BLESS EVERYONE 🙏❤️
That cop has no urgency and just slowly goes to car. Just another daybat work I guess. I dont know why but this bothers me the way he just went so slow.
That baby yelling, mama, please. Oh my God, my tears.
How is the cop going to yell “Is somebody in their” like if he didn’t already know 👿
Hurry up and get his momma 💔
God bless you all
Brave child helping to rescue his mum.
Never get to view stories like this on the news. Negative, negative, negative. Happy to read she is doing better. Lil man saved her life and men not hesitating.
Thank god for everyone’s part in this story.  Her son, the rescuer and cop along with emt. Hospital staff
Is he really asking is someone in their the kid told you his momma was in their 😢
That poor boy 😢
Why was the cop not acting with urgency? Yeah he helped, but hewas pretty relaxed even when he saw the car literally half way in, and asking,"is she in there? Is somebody here?" Come on.
That cop was so useless in that save it’s not even funny, first thing he hears is a kid saying my mom is in the car. Then he walks up to the car and starts asking stupid questions, is there someone in here? Are the doors locked? All while very slowly walking around the car. A civilian saved that woman.. when a car is submerged you can’t open doors cause of the outside water pressure, only when the car is completely submerged in and out will that door be able to be opened.
Thank GOD! Help was on the way. The LORD heard this child's desperate cry. Devine Intervention. Amen! 🙂☝🏾🙏🏾!!!
Why is he asking if someone is in there when the boy already told him his mom was in there?
Mom had a seizure...ohh no😢😢
It really pisses me off when someone asked something that you just told them in frantic State like goodness gracious  God bless you lil one
Man just stfu and get her out wtf?!?!?!
Respect aux deux hommes 🙏👍😍d'avoir pu sauver la mère de ce jeune garçon qui était tellement angoissé ... Mais sera toujours là pour lui montrer son amour...de l'avoir sauvé ce jour là aussi ❤😍🥰 merci encore aux deux  hommes pour que ce jeune garçon ne soit pas orphelin ...en perdant sa douce maman....ces trois personnes ont tous fait pour sauver la mère du jeune garçon... ❤❤❤bravo à vous trois... respect 🙏👍❤😍
Bless everyone involved.
Oh my God. Could that officer take more fucking time. Unbelievable. Walking up to the car asking the child if anyone is in there piece of shit officer.
Never saw another town named west orange. Greetings from WO town in New Jersey
That Mexican 🇲🇽  guy saved her. Why isn't anyone bringing up citizenship status or ethnicity???? But let it be something bad...
❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you for that man that God also use to save her.
😂😂😂😂
Thank God for using her son and the cops to save her.
That child’s look of terror and desperation broke my heart
This is why people that suffer seizures are not allowed to drive. Inconvenient? Yes, but can save lives.
That cop really didn't care. Thank God for the kids and good samaritan.
Bless her son and all involved with her rescue.
“IS SOMEBODY IN THERE” Boi…. Come on
STUPID COP… “Is somebody in there” he shouts to the car. Yes… her son told you his mum is in there, so you should’ve ran into the water to start your rescue mission asap, since timing was critical.  He was literally waiting to hear if anyone shouted back. Idiot. He wasn’t acting like it was urgent.
❤😢 That baby bless his soul, he saved his momma.❤
That little boy is so brave ❤
Awesome save😊
That baby saved his mom!
Cop asking dumb questions just go and help the poor lady "is the car unlocked" he asked  stupid cop
Moving way too slow for me no sense of urgency,
That to all the ones that helped them.
O my😢
😳😳
How’s his mom??? ❤
Yeah, Officer, this is the time to ask a bunch of questions not the time to take action ffs
This baby boy. I wanna hug him  His hurt and strength gave him thr right words to communicate
Why are you asking if someone is in there when this boy JUST told you his mom was in there 😡 Very unnecessary
Wow heartbreaking to watch,little boy couldn't breathe so happy to read she's going to pull through ' you'll are hereos.
Glad she's doing better. Her heroic son thank you for finding help
When I drive near water I roll my windows down. I rather be able to swim out of a open window
Yea that cop got on my nerves from the beginning… the kid tells you his mom is in the car and you go up to it yelling “is anyone there” 🤦🏽‍♀️ useless asffff
Little black kids soaked and shaken saying she had a seizure she sinking car SINKING ‼️YOU WALK UP CASUALLY TO A CAR IN A RIVER SAYING ANYBODY IN THERE‼️ No sense of urgency from that trooper 🤦🏾‍♂️
I'm bawling right now!!!
Sending prayers God be with them all thanks officer for going there to help!!
Dude already told him his mom was in there -.- he really had to ask wasting time smh
Horrible. Goes to show skin color don’t matter. Love is love. Trump 2024 🇺🇸
Officer is too busy asking questions, when he should've immediately went to the car to see if anyone was stuck inside... in life or death situations every second counts...
Is somebody in there???...wth ..go see
The boy is begging for help and he asking 21 questions.
La madre se encontró con el policía que la visito en la UCI y ella le dijo a él, ya eres familia qué lindo gesto pocos salvan la vida de otro ser humano ,sus padres le dieròn la mejor educación para tener una capa de héroe ,Se ganó a Dios desde siempre❤
The little boy just told you his mom in there!!!!
That cop is slow!!!
Thanks guys and I hate to see that much fear in a kids face. You guys saved his world and thank you 🙏🏻
how did he know she was having a seizure? she must have a history of it.
Good job everybody. Little man made sure his mom was going to make it.❤😢❤
Thank goodness 🙏 BUT and thats a big hefty BUT you are prone to having seizures you have no business behind the wheel. All in all m happy she's ok so glad baby boy could have gotten help in time.
The child's face said so much my heart broke  💔 Thankfully he was able to find this wonderful man💙🖤💙🖤💙🖤🙏🙏🙏❤️
Wtf is the cop going "is anybody in there?" Of course somebody is in the car the poor baby is screaming at you to help her!
Thank you for the update
Poor kid!I hope his mom is ok 🙏🏼🙏🏼
That poor baby. He must of been so scared. It broke my heart. I pray that she survived.
I am crying like a newborn right now
That cop is such a imbecile. He needs to be off the force. He didn’t say that person in that car at all he just showed up asking questions that were already answered to him by that kid that really pisses me off had no speed about himself or nothing is somebody in there someone from under the water out of the water, God people are so such idiots these days
Useless cop. “Is she in there?” Get your dumbass in there and get her out.
Honestly, honestly, that cop didn’t do shit right the kid is the reason that that person is still alive who the fuck comes in asking questions that I’ve already been answered to you before you got there that had me so pissed
If she was having a seizure, as in epileptic seizure, why is she driving?? Awful accident.
If more people would get involved it things like this when needed we would have a better world. For all of us ! God Bless all 3 of them. The little boy is so scared for his mother. Bless his heart.
Poor child, but...  "She's having a seizure" ?!?  She's not supposed to drive if she has seizures.
Cop wasn't even in a rush and barely listening to the kid at the beginning telling him his mom is in there.
Okay, so this is all heroic and touching and I’ll thankful the little boy still has his mom, but . . . The young child clearly knows what a seizure is and was able to quickly recognize it, as though he is familiar with what they look like.  People with seizures are forbidden from driving by their doctor, as inconvenient as that may sound, for the very reason that something like this could happen, in which  a seizure while driving could lead to a disastrous accident. So why would she be driving, especially with her child in the car?
Such a brave young man!!  I pray that God had his heart on this situation and the mother was saved.
Why would you record this and not just save her lol
As a mother with epilepsy, I would never get behind the wheel with my child in the car without my dog that alerts me that I’m going to have an episode getting to any destination is not worth the life of my child, or my own, if people with epilepsy are going to drive, they need to do so responsibly. She literally could have gotten her son or herself killed.
God bless them ❤
Thank you for your service. I hope she made it.
Thank you Dear Jesus for sending help, to save her & her son.
Cop took too long to get his ass in the water tbh.
This is why epilepsy is so scary.
Poor kid. What a horrible  thing for that poor kid. Thank God for the  officer.  ❤
Calling out saying”MOMMA” broke me. 😢😢😢To God be the GLORY 🙏🙏🙏.
Glory be to God and all his Angels 😇
Thats why i really hate electric doors in cars.
Couldn't tell if she was ok. Can someone reply and let us know?
He saved his mommas life for sure ❤❤
He told you his mom in there go help ppl are idiots
God bless to you all. XLX ❤
Oh, how scary this is for that child my heart goes out to him. My mom had seizures and would drive and yes would have one while driving. Because of that, I had nightmares of just this here; going into water and not being able to escape, scary dream for a young child.  Hope all are well 🙏
Salute to the officer 💯
My heart goes out to little man....great job young fella along with the cop and the man that was already in the water...but my question does she have a history of seizures ?? If yes why is she still driving?? Just a question
Angel
This is why epileptics get their licenses taken - my sister could of ended up like this but she is no longer allowed to legally drive herself. I wish this woman the best but if she has a seizure disorder of any kind she needs her license revoked. This could have gone very different and her and her kids could have died.
Angel
Look at the fear in this kid face he trying hard to save his mother 😢😢😢
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
That was put there at the right place and the right time to help them get out God Bless him
Everyone, this is a police officer being a police officer and doing what they do.  Thank god they are there. This man is a hero BUT would this man even have been there if the Democrats defunded police as they so VERY much want to.  Not all heros wear capes, most wear blue.
Crocodile waters
Call 911
Thank those that Helped Her and Her Son❤👏🏿💐
If you have a condition that causes seizures, stay from behind the wheel. I mean this with sincerity.
The cop took his sweet time, dude
This just brought me to tears. Thank You ALL but most importantly THANK YOU GOD!
Makes me cry. What a trauma. So glad Mama is okay!!! ❤
God bless you you are an angel
Just brought tears to my eyes 🫶🏾🙌🏾💪🏾
That cop was so slow
Why did it take so long for him to react responding to the car? He asked several times if somebody there. If she is on the water, I don’t think she can respond to him. Smfh🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
You cant park there!
Thank GOD for her son. He saved his mother's life. He was aware of what was going on and located the police and showing them where she at.
Thank God that baby was able to get that. Police officer's attention to save his Mother 😢😢. But if anyone finds themselves in this situation, you see how the car is floating, break the back windshield window.
Worst day of his life poor kid had to see that happen thank god for the police being there to help him and thank god for making that kid so courageous
May the Most High bless each person involved in this situation. 😢😮😢😮😢😮
Yawn
Cop seemed reluctant, like he was already clocked out and about to go home and lay on the couch for four hours
Made me so nervous watching that. Omg.
This broke my heart. I begin to cry. I can’t even imagine this happening to me poor baby.
He's jus doing his police duties to protect an serve as he did!!! Thank you sir
Some of the effort he used to hold the phone to make this video could've been used to do a quicker rescue.
Hey ma’am you can’t park there
God bless  you
It pissed me off why tf you gone yell "is someone in thier" when the boy said "she haveing a siesure, she sunk" then the poor baby had to yell "help her" wtf
Is somebody in there? Yes, the boy just told you she had a seizure and she was in the water!
alleluia .prays you God
Is she in there❓NO... HE MADE IT UP... HOW STUPID❓is somebody in there  WELL IF YOU LOOKED YOUDE KNOW the kids telling him repeatedly❗but hes SCARED TO DEATH❗ ANOTHER USELESS POLICE MAN....  thank god for that little kid❗and a solid citizen
Thank you .officer
Every time I drive over a bridge  I always put my window down, come rain or shine ,as this is would be My worst nightmare! I started doing this 30yrs ago when I had my twins and I’ve carried on ever since, really felt the fear in that little boys  face and voice so glad they all got her out, and pray she makes it 😢
God is so good Amen 🙏
Thank you so much for valuing the life of others. ❤
So much trauma for this young boy.
The boy said there’s somebody in there he should’ve acted on that without questioning and yelling out, “is somebody in there”? I find it very curious how slow and calculated he’s moving so that he can film. Absolutely ridiculous! If others don’t see this they are blind.
Thank God she's doing OK, that poor boy and mother praying she has a full recovery
A big thank you to that police officer who saved this womans life.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Instead of dramatic word they should have used urgent. Saying dramatic is a negative stereotype towards people of color. College educated journalists knows that, change it.
At the right place at the right time GODS TIME GOD IS GREAT
Tears
Brovo team what a marvelous thing. Blessings to you all...🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙏🏽
God bless
God bless that baby boy for knowing what to do
I can see he is wet. Good job for alerting someone about mom.
That kid saved her life and the cop 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Omg my heart..😢bless his little heart,just imagine how scared he was.
Thank YOU JESUS CHRIST N BLESS 🙌 YOU LIL ONE 🙏 AMEN!!!!
How did he get out. He didn’t look wet.
Lord
This man really has no intentions of saving this woman. He was forced to help. The child panicking said she needs help and your slowly walking asking is she in there. On top of asking more dumb questions. Sir you need to have your @$$ FIRED!!! 😤😡🤬
But God .Amen 🙏🏽💜🙏🏽
So sad  feel bad for this boy
Is somebody in there????  Thanks to the other  person   this Mother is alive!
Most cops would be afraid of getting their tightie whities wet.
That cop didn’t do much at all — he had very little urgency
I don’t like the cops reaction and his lack of speed to the emergency how he spoke to the boy and then on the way to the car in the water he’s asking if anyone is in the car you see a whole other person in the water urgently tryna to get the mother out he’s not in there taking a lap in the water for fun he should have jumped in there right away the main heros of the story is the man who was already there and the boy I wish people would stop giving praise to cops just because they are cops that lady would have been dead messing around with him didn’t even sound like he wanted to help tbh
🥺
"Is somebody in there?" That's what the boy litterally just told you!! "Are the doors unlocked?" Really??? Like that's what your brain will register first when you're heads down in the water 😖
Wow you can see her arms flapping around and that’s scary! This young boy needed a hug .. 😢
Cops is stupid. Is she in the is she in there. The little boy told u she was in there when he came to get u
If ses having a seizure why foes she have a drivers license ? In sweden you cant have a license if you have certain health issues
Much love and appreciation to that kid who flagged down a stranger to get help. And much love and appreciation to the stranger and cop who jumped in the water to save the lady.❤❤
That cop mocked like molasses! 😮
❤🙏🏼
I just wish that little boy was a little bit older because the fact that he could run for help. That means that he know how to swim and he could saved his mother, but he still saved her at the end They should give him a medal or something for that.
Is somebody in there?-  if you’re underwater and having a seizure could you tap once- tap twice if the child is exaggerating because I’m pretty sure that’s why I move in slow motion?
That man saved her! Hopefully she is still alive! I would like to know who that guy is who got her out! May the most high God blesses him all the days of his life! He did not waist any time trying to get her out without even saying one word.
Cop asking questions in the beginning is annoying. There's a car and someone needs help is enough for anyone not to question but silence and actions
Damn, you can tell that cop didn't care a all. No urgency, like he Said fuck it, if she drowns😢
Poor baby almost lost his mother before his eyes that would traumatized him for life ..... thank you most high for the police officer quick response❤...  there's an angel watching over her...
Bless his heart hope all is well with the both of them ❤
That man saved her! Hopefully she is still alive!
Salute 2 Real Heroes
Lord have mercy 🙏🏽🙏🏽
😢omg little man scared as hell thank goodness someone got to her rescue
I don’t know about you  But…..the cop wasn’t that eager to help. Clearly she’s in there, the boy said so , the man was trying to get in the car , the cop just said step it up . Who knows did he call a paramedic in advance…. His tool saved her life, she would have drowned without it . Oh well just saying….. She had a Angel with her  Thank god everyone was at the right place right time ❤
When he pulled you over Officer, he said she sank. She’s in the car and you had the nerve to stop and ask when you got to the scene if she’s in the car free more times how stupid are you? This cop don’t listen.
I hope that little guy and his mom are okay and that they have healthy long life of blessings.
Break the back window and reach in and unlock the door! Or get inside through the back seat to help her. Omg! Terrible rescue tecniqie. He needs more training! Common sense would tell him to break the nack pasengers window! Why is he tapping on the drivers window under that water!
Thank God the son was there to give help. I don't drive anymore because of this reason and my son at 7 saved my life.
Boy that dude sure wasn’t in a hurry
God bless this beautiful Country and the wonderful people. 🖤💙🖤
Guess a Man is needed..
If she has a seizure disorder like her child said then she should not be driving she's at risk not only to herself but to her family and also other people on the road.
This have me in tears...
Thank God he was able to get help
❤
That poor child 😢
These officers should carry tools to break those windows ro get in. What do he mean step it up!
Cop was acting to slow ima call it out how I see it the young man already told you his mother was in there
He sure is taking his sweet and lovely time about getting in that water! She is seizing he shouls have rushed to get in there.
Thanks be to God for these great men!
The most nonchalant police officer I've  ever seen.
Ohhh my! When i was diagnosed with epilepsy in my 30s my doctor was duty bound 2 notify the DVLA 2 have my licence revoked. It broke my heart but wow this brings shows me why people who take seizures should never be allowed 2 drive.
THAT COP TOOK WAY TO LONG. WHY WOULD A CHILD BE HYSTERICAL IF HE WAS LYING ABOUT HIS MOM.....SO STUPID...
Man tjat's scary. Teach your kids how to get you both out. Thank God she ok.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow that cop sucks
Forget what y’all talking about the cop knew from the jump he wasn’t finna help when the kid came so he knew what the situation was before he got there then the video cut when she said help her and now he right behind the car the cop thought about saving a life when it shouldn’t have been a thought about  he should of sprung into action
People who have seizures are not supposed to drive I know this because my father-in-law has epilepsy and as soon as he was diagnosed they yanked his driver's license I'm happy that everybody was saved with this is why you're not supposed to drive when you have seizures
He’s not a Good Samaritan.  He’s a police officer doing his job. Great work sir.
No sense of urgency, only public servants get that, not the tax cattle, sorry young man.
Dumb question,  asking the kid if car is unlocked
Precious boy. He kept his head and saved her. ❤
Liam?!
Finally a cop doing something other than bullying people
Omg that scary asf poor boy he is traumatized by this event,my baby momma has epilepsy and I always worry about her having a seizure while driving
I hope that she was alright. Hearing that child in distress does something to your soul 😢
Wow that poor woman is having a seizure!
That baby done a great job finding help for his momma ❤ hope she doing ok 🙏
Dint want to get his donut wet!
Good samaritan??? THAT’S HER CHILD SAY IT HOW IT IS TF??
REAL HEROES
Hurry! Listen to the kid!
I started crying right here in the car repair shop
How she got in there??😢
So sad
That Cop Really Pissed Me Off and I HOPE He Isn’t The Whole Taking Credit! He TOLD YOU His Mom Was Seizing IN THE SINKING CAR!! And You Yell To The Car “Is Someone In There”. Wthh??🤬 Thank Goodness For That Little Boy Being Able To Save His Mommies Precious Life. HE IS A HERO And That Strange Man Is A HERO!!!!
He acted like he didn't want to help... I don't think he's a good samaritan he's just a cop doing his job
😪😪😪😪😪😪
Lord God is good!
The officer said" is any body in there?"Yet he  supposed to call emergency while he was entering the water..Never did the camera show the woman 😢
My heart 😢 that poor baby
Cop wasn't to concerned took it lightly and asked too many questions
Thank God for great cops and all around  great people everywhere .
The majority of people on here would have did nothing
When crossin a bridge ..Always put your window downn .till u clear that bridge ..also unhook your belt .clear bridge .everybody .hook up .as told too me by a friend.🎉❤.luv your family
He is her superman
You did a good job buddy so glad mommas gonna pull thru
How is she doing?! Amen to the kid who was able to get out and get help. Prayers!!!
❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽
Heroes
Praise God from Whom ALL blessings flow! 🙏🏽
❤❤❤❤
Respect for this child and I really hope that that lady didn't know that she was an epileptic and still was driving around with her child knowing at any moment this could happen
If that woman knew she had seizures she shouldn't ever been behind the wheel of a vehicle EVER
AMEN 🙏 🙏 🙏
God is the best ever🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
A C A B
He was just taking his time like wtf
Damn man this right here gives me hope for the world 🌎 I swear that little boy is definitely his mother's angel. The cop and the other person helping stayed calm and got her out safe 🙏 praise God 👏 🙌🏾 🙏 ❤️ ♥️ 💙 👏 🙌🏾 🙏 ❤️ ♥️ blessings to them all.
That child just saved his mom by getting an adult as quickly as he could. This could have been so much worse!
Awe mannn🥺
That cop did not wanna go j. There
Why tf is he moving super slow? He didnt call no for a ambulance it took that lil boy screaming at him to help her for him to go in that water
WTF you mean,"Is somebody in there?". He already told you she was. Then he asked is the car unlocked. STUPID QUESTIONS BUDDY!! But thank GOD he got her out in time to save her.
The cop acted like he didnt want to go in the water  like he didnt believe the kid.  Just wow
Is somebody in there?? I mean, he just said she's in the water...
Praise God that both were saved and blessings to the gentlemen that helped.  But she shouldn't drive anymore. It's too dangerous
I hope the lady ok..
Thank you Lord for saving her. God bless these officer's
This made me anxious and then have chill bumps. The child did a great job getting help!
Lord I pray for this family 🙏
Y DID THE COP ASK ?! JUST GO GET HER! THE SON WAS TELLIN THE COP 2 SAVE HER
The only hero here is that young fella, what do you mean if there’s somebody in there? man gtfooh
The anguish of a sweet child...Thank you, Jesus for sending timely help. Praying for a full recovery of his mother's health and an abundance of blessings to her son and all those involved with her rescue.
Oh my gosh that poor boy. This made me cry.   I have a seatbelt cutter and window breaker in every vehicle, in two different spots. There’s so much water where I live it’s a real concern.
The both had an Angel.  He was in the right place at the right time.  🙏🏾
This broke my heart and made me cry. When I had a seizure it scared my kids and my son 10 at the time ran for help because his dad was picking up my medicine at the time. It traumatized my kids.💔💔💔 Me as well when I saw it on camera.
Liam?
OMG this is heartbreaking poor child. So glad his is ok
Wow just help the damn woman he said to you his mom is in there why did have to keep asking. Just do, don't ask. The little boy said It like 3 times
Kid: she having g a seizure, she in there  Cop: is she in there?, is somebody in there?
Took to long for him to get to that car for me
This little boy cries broke my heart
Thank God her hero son didn't panic and the  two cops were  on it❤❤🙏🙏
Oh my God, hearing that child explaining through his panic... Heartbreaking.
The cop seemed to be  hesitant to help out. he had a nonchalant tone to his voice ,  he kept  asking is she in there ?" is sombody  in there " after the child had frantically expressed she had a seizure  he seemed to be moving with a slow non caring kinda way , smh But Thank The Most High God she was rescued by two other willing people , and thank you to the person who updated us on her condition keeping her in prayer as she recovers ✝️🙏
Why is he yelling “is someone in there?” The kid just told him she was and he’s taking his sweet time.
Thank you for helping
The response time of this the cop is terrible..
God was with you, God was with you. Why didn’t Jesus Christ with you your son God God was with him with you and with whoever was in that car and the officer officer baby goes with him
Brave young man , what love for his momma
The officer with the dumb ass questions. He already told you she was damn drowning!!!! 😢😢
That child so desperate. God bless him. Remember the police officers when bad things are happening they don't run away. They run in support the blue
I wish moments like this were as far spread as all the bad news. The kid was so brave even through his fear, managing to articulate the situation, and the police did a great job staying calm and jumping into action! Everyone is a hero here ❤
God bless that man
Omg did she make it?? Poor kiddo
This is what police are supposed to do help people ❤
Just get in there ffs
He’s not only her beautiful baby boy, but her angel on this earth.
why he got attitude in his voice tho smh
Why did that cop need so much reassurance, go help the kids mom man
Actually God(Jesus Christ is he) is the real savior behind any of us. Death can't happen to someone unless God allows it to. So when you see people in real crazy life threatening situations and the still lived through it all it's because God didn't allow death to get them yet. It's called an act of mercy. It doesn't matter who was used to get God will done being it to save a life or death just know no man gets the credit for life saving. To y'all your saying three ppl saved her but I see God's mercy applied and he used three ppl as tools to get his will done. God can do no evil even if it seems evil to us. God allowed your grandmother to die and you would say why would God allow her to die? Easy everyone except those who will be alive when the Lord comes will die. It doesn't matter how just know when it's your turn it's your turn nothing you can do about it except God change his mind concerning it. Tornadoes and earthquakes and what not seem evil but it's just a few of God's ways of punishing the human family for being disobedient to his word, it can be used to round the ppl up for judgment day and also used as an act of mercy. Probably other things too but that's to deep for me. The moral you may ask? Always give God the credit if his mercy gets applied to any one first. Then you can thank the tools(people or person ) used later. The truth of the matter is even if they got her out the car and did everything they knew possible to save her and it still didn't work then that would have meant it was just her time to check out of this temporary life we all live in.
That precious little boy saved his mama. He’s a hero. God bless him.❤❤❤
I feel for himm. 😢😢😢
Well this young man will probably grow up to apreciate police instead of harass and disrespect them.
He’s is mom’s angel❤.
TO GOD BE ALL GLORY!!
SAVE LIVES NOT TAKE THEM  BLM TOO THANKS FOR RESPONDING
Thank you JESUS CHRIST. GOD BLESS the brave son and the police IJNA
Good Samaritan cop he literally sat there as the boy rushed in to help. He did nothing.
He ain't even trying to get her out
That kid breaks my heart. He saved his mother
🙏 praying 🙏 for her safety
Orange. Tx 😮🙏
The good Samaritan  and son saved the lady.
Thank God they were able to get to her in time. Kudos to the kid and rescuers. ❤
Thank you Jesus
A good one? Probably not. The enforcment arm of white-supremacy in my country. Cut that FBA check.
What a brave & smart boy❤ I hope his mom recovers soon ❤
God bless that young boy who save his mum
The cop keeps asking if she is in there.Yes she in there,moving slow,he does not want to get wet!!!
And then he arrested her for swimming while black.
That young man ran his fastest to get help and the officer didn't hesitate to help. The desperation in his voice hurt my heart. The way all the help came together healed my heart.
Oh my Lord 😣😢! How terrifying that had to be for this young man. Thank God him, this officer and EMS that was able to save her. Prayers for Mom’s full recovery and the continued endurance and wellness of her son. 🙏🏾
Good Samaritans
Thanks to the little Angel for finding help and thanks to the cop (the Guardian Angel) for saving the Mom. He should definitely get the key to the city bc he didn’t give up on saving her life🙏🏾😇🙌🏾❤️
Kid crying for help. Cop slowly walks to the car
Poor boy 😔 he did a great job alerting people  I hope his mom is okay .
Blessings to this mom and child🙏❤️
Cops Have The Slowest Reaction Time To Real Danger But The Fastest When It’s No Real Danger🤦🏾‍♂️
GOD is in the business of BLESSINGS!!🛐✝️💝
Its crazy how calm the coffee drinker is
Traumatic,, scary
Good job to her son..what an angel.
Glory to God! He still sits on the throne! May God continue to protect and add a double blessing to the officer that moved quickly. God cover her son let him know who you are in every aspect of his life. God positions people to be exactly where He needs them to be. We all have undisclosed angels walking this earth. Amen
Bless that poor babies heart ❤ what a hero ❤
Father God!!!! Awesome kiddo!!!!❤❤❤ thank God for kind hearted people
The cop didn't want to save his mama
Thank God for those heroes.
Thank u officer,  this a real police man doing his duty. Tupac said he like good cops that do there job ❤
Thank you, Jesus thank you Jesus
Did she live?
That poor boy that just broke my heart
26:57 mr bundles wheels turning like he just saw a unattended zero turn club cadet😂
😢 💔🙏🏻 omg thank the Lord Jesus Christ! He saved his momma!! Brave Little boy❤🙏🏻🦋🤍🕯️
That’s what happens when you buy a Dodge Charger and speed/drive like a maniac. I see it all the time. Then they cry when their kid witnesses them nearly lose their life over it.
Thank you Jesus❤❤❤
Priceless what that little boy which is a hero did to save his mother. Congrats to all that helped. Im overwhelmed with joy and sadness to see this occur. 😢😢😊😊
Praying 🙏🏽
Water  is scary 😨
Repent Jesus is using me to warn the world to start living for Jesus Christ before it's too late get baptized and filled with the holy Spirit please don't get too comfortable in this world or body it's temporary remember Jesus is the reason why we are still alive please Don't take that lightly
Cop didn’t do shit per usual
An they be wanna talk bad about white cops you see there is some good ones out there ❤
He really didn't want to get wet. Thats what thats about. Come on with the, "is somebody in there mess" How dare he ask that when they baby is screaming help her!
The cop was an idiot the child said The mother was having a seizure. Why would he call out and ask if anybody was in there before jumping in the water?
Is somebody in there stop wasting time he just said that 😢 glad they got her out
❤and to think the nit wits want to get rid of our heroes ❤
She was having a seizure. Maybe don't drive anymore
Lord have mercy
You all need to have follow up information and post the follow up when uploading these types of videos out of respect for the victims and your viewers . It comes across as you are just using these ppls horrific experience as shock factor entertainment. Obviously ppl will want to know if the victims are okay.  Come on. Do Better!
Mmmmmm let me guess Florida??
This boy saved his momma HERO🫶 Salute too all the HERO’s that day on that Road
where was the cops urgency tho
Not understanding why your asking is somebody in there if he literally just told you his mom is in there
Hallelujah they saved her🙌🏾
I was literally there this is in orange tx I've lived here 29 years. Her name is Jonquetta Winbush she's in her late 30's and her 2 kids were in the car when she had a seizure. She was in ICU for 3 weeks she's out now and fine. That is one of 2 small ponds at the beginning of the bridge. I was leaving Wal Mart and saw this. The good Samaritan is actually a good friend of mine and is the pastor at a church right down the street from where this was.
That cop is taking his time . Thank God for the guy who saved her .
❤❤❤❤❤❤ GOOD JOB BABY SAVING UR AUNTIE R MOM SHE'S GOING TO BE OK.U SAVE HER BABY 🎉🎉🎉❤
Cop did zero.
And she still hates cops, white folks, and will vote democrat again
Oh man, that poor kid, is somebody in there? YES, THE KIDS MUM LIKE HE JUST TOLD YOU😮
She has a good son ❤
His mama gave him life ; now he gave her one ❤
That young lady broke my heart.... so glad the cop was close❤🇦🇺
The look of terror on her young sons face broke my heart 💔 Thank goodness for this policeman and total stranger 🙏🙏💜💜
🙌🙌
OMG. That poor child. His desperation is palpable.  I sure hope all is okay with his mom.
God bless them all.  That poor little boy was so brave.  He pushed through his fear because his love for his Mother was far stronger. ❤
Yesss brave young man. Thank you to the officer (God had an angle in route). Just in time!❤😢
God bless that police officer 🙏
Glory to God thank you Jesus praise the Lord for all his blessings.
Dang officer take your sweet time
I Lord I pray she's ok!! And this baby is  a true Angel and the cop❤❤❤❤❤
😢😢😢😢That baby so scared 😢😢😢😢Did she make it. Dayum I cried where my tissues at
“Quick . My mom is having. Seizure , she’s in the car …” cop: I some one in there ? ..”
Aww that sadness on his face & the tone of panic in his voice thinking he was going to lose his mother is heartbreaking 💔  That poor boy, I pray she's making a full recovery. Thank u all who took part in saving this little boys mother
Thank you Jesus for the safety !
That cop smh he told him she was in the car and he was taking his time. Because he did want to get wet. He's not a good samaritan. He's a cop he's supposed to help.
Amen God is So Good.
Police: nowhere does it say that the POLICE have to do HEROIC ISH, yet on the REGULAR I KEEP SEEING POLICE DO HEROIC ISH. Yeah … to ALL the POLICE HATERS…they’re far from perfect as no human is perfect. Just imagine just imagine one day without them
God bless that baby… and the people that rescued her🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Hello, are you ok?  Are you in there? Do you have your id and insurance?  Mamm you can't park there
This is what is calle sn emergency dude. Soeed the fuck up!!!!
Lord bless this poor baby and his mother in the name of the Lord Jesus.🙏
Is it me or did the brave young man tell the cop his mom was in the car… why was he wasting time asking if she was in the car? That’s the first thing I heard.
Well Done Boy. 3 vital sentences, all need to know basis, so brave to get what info was needed to get that help asap.  ❤❤
Maaaan, that was insane
This broke my heart but so happy they were able to save this mother.
I didn’t think it was legal for people with seizure disorders to drive a vehicle.
This is why they sometimes take a a persons license.
ABC = FAKE NEWS
Thank you JESUS 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️
This is how Americans should be. Giving a helping hand. Not being selfish, chicken sh!+ a$$hole$ who don't do ANYTHING but film what's going on and posting it. 😢
Cop was pretty slow moving if you ask me.   Good Samaritan hopped straight into action.
Wow that's scary as hell !God bless them all
Ohh lord thans so much .God blessed. Send the boy  angel 😇 that for save the mommy 👩 get well soon. ❤
God bless the cop that rescued her from drowning ❤️❤️
Thank God, he stopped to help. There are STILL good people around, A lot of times you don't see them. But this day was a miracle for this child.🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m traumatized
Oh that baby boy broke my heart. He saved thw day 🙌
Lord God bless that man
Amazing young man praying for them to be ok
❤️
😢❤
Why is the cop being so slow about it when the child is screaming to help her? I’m happy she was saved but that dude had me upset
Thank. God.
THANK you JESUS❤❤❤❤
Thanks be to God that she made it. This is 100% why I don't drive. Even with meds you never know when a seizure will hit. I totaled my car on a major highway during morning rush. Spun totally around 3 lanes, hit the concrete divider & hit nobody! The hand of God protected me & all others on the road. I haven't driven since. Friends & Uber are not worth the cost of a life.😢😢😢
He didn't even want to go in the water 👌
🙏🙏
So he told kid get in let’s go down there in beginning of vidio ,,,, how far did kid run to get help finally or how many people seen this and figured not going stop cause didn’t want be late for work or soccor practice or didn’t want get stuck in traffic????
Ya...❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅
Excelente trabajo del Policía.
Very brave cuz depending where this is , I’m thinking alligators
In the Uk if you have had a seizure you cannot drive until you are free from them for one year. Even if you have the seizure while sleeping your driving licence is revoked until you can demonstrate that you are a year free of them. Your doctor will inform the licensing authority
Hope all went well.  God bless!
Poor boy ❤
Cop was slow and had the "I gotta do this " attitude.  "Is the car unlocked?  Butbhe will gladly take the citation
Show me ur hands 🔫😂 💯
Right place at the perfect time. Angela are all around us. Blessings to everyone. Hope  Mom's okay
❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is protecting and serving...yesss
Dios mio señor😢
Once the electricity stops you can't unlock the car if you can't grab the lock and unlock it and some cars are like that
Cop is too chill
Please please please, am not meaning to be mean, I have bad sleep apnea and know in myself that I cannot drive. This is so heartbreaking, this is one of the lucky moments, but thinking of those who might have lost their lives .........am lost of words
He was in no hurry😖asking the child if the car ia unlocked really😡? uggh!
Blessed Assurance HERO AMEN, Thank YOU Siri 💚💙🩶🌏🤠💜🧡🤩✝️🎉🌎⭐💥💝💪😁🌍🕯️🕊️🤎💯🙏🕯️🕊️🙏🕯️🕊️❤️😘🌟✨🌛🌜💫
Bro this cop did not act like he wanted to save them. I'd been in that water at the car instantly.
THAT YOU SO VERY VERY VERY MUCH FOR FIRST RESPONDERS THAT WERE THERE HELP SUCH SERIOUS SITUATION WHICH MEANT EVERY MOMENT MEET IT WAS PRECIOUS MOMENT AN THEY HANDLE IT AS HERRO THAT GOD SENT 😇🙏😇🙏
Oh my God this is heart breaking to see this kid cry for help💙🙏🏾
Thank you!
ده وقت تصوير الله يحرق الفيديوهات والتصوير وانك تاخود لايكات اخييييييه علي بني ادم والتحكم اللي اتحكمت فيه التكنولوجيا اللهم استرنا فوق الارض وتحت الارض ويوم العرض عليه
The cop didn't move vary fast
July 24, 2024? Man they sure do release the good cop footage quickly. What, y'all got a PR department that asks at roll call if there is anything positive from the last shift? Don't tell us if on the same recording you shot someone in the face in their home, or choked someone, or shot someone running away in the back or hit a bystander with your car.
How sad he moved so damn slow
Thank you lord for saving this family .. please stay with them ....
Can she NOT drive from now on—-just to be on the safe side😢❤❤
Poor baby 😔 hope he’s mums ok
What a worthless cop,  is she in there, no stupid of course she is...
It’s crazy these cops go in the water save peoples life. This video gets no views. cop says or does one thing wrong it gets millions this is the problem with society
Humanity can be touching
GOD YOU ARE GREAT
What hero’s ❤ oh man I’m so happy his mom is ok because after that scare he didn’t need no more pain . What a little hero thanks for all the helpers wow ❤
That little boy is a hero for calling attention to their wreck! Rescuers may not have noticed without him escaping & calling attention to his mom's distress. 🙏
When the cop got to the car there was someone else trying to take her out…. So thank you both and especially the son that was brave enough to get help for his mom!💛🪽👏🏼
Amen
God bless them men❤
Great Heroes🙏
Could that policeman MOVED ANY SLOWER???  Is somebody in there?  Stupid sod didn't want to get wet saving her life!!!
Brave young man and great Cop 😮😊😊❤❤
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾. Such a brave kids he stay calm enough to get help 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
That poor child. May Gid bless him. Hearing such desperation in voice brought me to tears. I hope his mom is ok.
Jesus christ. ZERO rush on the cops part
That little boy was brave❤❤❤❤❤
It wasn't submerged, 😂,adding for the drama
I'm surprised the cop didn't run up demanding license and registration proof of insurance and explaining how she can't park there
This is sad. If you're someone that has seizures you shouldn't be driving
I wish this boy and his mom a great recovery and all the best in life.
Praise God he was able to make it out in order to save his mother
Thanks to this kind man for saving this woman and her son
Slowest rescue ever omg
Cop sounding dumb as hell. The person drowning isn't going to answer. The little kid that came to you telling you his mom was in there told you that someone is in there
Stupid cop, moving like a turtle and asking a frantic kid, IS THE CAR UNLOCKED...IDIOT
Hpw many times was the child going to tell the cops his mom was in there!.
Fook man that really brakes my heart iv been in some Fook up positions I kno frist hand how it feels when sum one u love is going down and u can't help them u feel helpless it's the worst feeling😢
Hurry up mate!!!! Seriously asking if she is in there and jst walking down...
"Is somebody in there?"  No, the kid just likes panicking and pointing at a sinking car.
If only the strength of my relationships was as strong as that window glass
This was so heartbreaking. I’m glad someone posted she is okay. He broke my soul. 💙
O.mmmmmmg this poor baby was so amazing 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Thank God it was him to the rescue. If it was me she mightve died. I would have hesitated to get in the water.
THIS ISN’T A 👮🏻 COP. THIS IS A POLICE OFFICER. THEY  PROTECT AND SERVE.
Thank you Jesus ❤
Cop standing there anyone in there dude run out there go don’t stand there wtf
Why would ask is somebody in there
the sense or urgency of the cop left the video
Poor kid
Thank God for her rescue. But, I thought people with seizures are not allowed to drive or operate heavy machinery equipment! Am just asking. JMO
Thank you Jesus for putting those brave ppl at the right place and for her hero son to find help.
Her SON is a hero and the Police Officer ..🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💕💕💕💕
Yea he help the kid but really dude u had to take ur time and think the kid was gonna set u up? Come on man what would of happened if this poor scared boy lost his mom all because of u and then he starts hanging out with the wrong people then u catch him shoot him cause u thought he had a gun and there a whole family wiped out because of a tyrant
My God when he screamed my mom my heart lord crying early this morning
Heroic ❤
Poor boy hepling save his mum God bless them both hope mum OK xx
May GOD bless your this officer and child 🙏
the agony i felt in my heart for this baby boy 😢😢
That man didnt have any urgency about himself  still recording is wild
Definitely a gator in that water .
Why the police was so slow and also repeatedly asked "she is there? Somebody is there" ...why didn't react immediately? Damn, there is NO time to lose in that questions
Still want to defund the police?
The cop was stupid. He just got told there is somebody in there, and hes like, hellooo is somebody inthere.
👮👮👍👏👏👏🙏❤️
Well, he said she was having a seizure and he still asks about someone being in there before getting out to help. Should have just went.
That cop was so slow
You are a hero cute son.❤
Thankfully, the cop and that guy was there because there’s no way that that little boy would’ve been able to break the window open himself and get his mom out however, if it wasn’t for him, the reality of it is is she probably wouldn’t be alive today the Lord works in mysterious ways guiding him to get older stronger people to help him so that way he could save his mama but I think the real hero Here was that child moving fast to find somebody to help him and also obviously God making sure that car didn’t sink all the way
The poor child thank god he was there to save his mom ❤
😮😢❤
BOY IS A HERO .... MAY GOD BE WITH YOU AND YOUR MOM AND FAMILY
Lord
That cop was useless too busy asking stupid questions standing on the side doing nothing - is it unlocked & is she still in there? The cop was too ignorant & racist for words.
How did he get out, couldnt they have gotten in that way?😮
🙏🏾❤️
Bless them...poor boy was so desperate
I got chills watching that baby plead for help!!! I pray she survived!!! I’m SO proud of her son!!!
So many irrelevant questions by the officers in the beginning
This is what real cops do. Not shooting every thing up because they are "scared"
Ohne Handy würde es noch schneller gehen.!
His sense of urgency is garbage!
Good bless this little kid this broke my heart happy to hear she's ok and the little boy hero
Yes, somebody’s in there. If the town told you that’s why you keep asking help.
Buddy?? Did ya cash your check on Friday? Get in the fkn water!!! Jesus
Is the car locked . Oh my god . Yeh it is officer I didn’t want anyone stealing it …… try the door numbskull
So glad he found help. God bless that boy and his family. Thank you rescuers💜
Omg!!!! May the woman live, the little boy have his mom again and the good officer be commended!
Geez you guys and your comprehensive skills are lacking common sense, just as much as the negative comments  The cop was obviously asking if someone was in there because the sister was on the outside attempting to help, and he obviously didn't know if it was the mother already out because you haven't bothered to do basic research.   Idk how many of you have been in the water,  unsure of the depth and wearing all your clothes in order to safely reach your exit. I think most of y'all are so ignorant and should take the time to learn basic survival techniques instead of victim blaming.
Poor child 🙏
I would like an update... Bless the Sons heart for getting help for his mother❤
Her son is the hero. Great job young man!❤
I am so thankful for the rescue... May the Most High comfort her son during this traumatic experience ❤ Those men are heros!
Thank you Lord for earthly angels
Make this go viral!
I hope she is okay. Someone needs to help that little kid mom. My heart is so touching .
Top lad what a good son xxxx
Why tf do u hav to tell EMS to "step it up" they should already be balls to walls smfh😢
God please bless this little boy and his family
Oh that poor baby! Glad they are ok ❤
The cop pissed me off . Stop asking if someone is in there and fkn help
I feel so sorry for the children of these drunk imbeciles, they don’t deserve to be going through these stresses for the parents poor decisions
To God be the glory, this child and mother is safe🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
How did she even end up in there@?? And did her son crawl out the window!!??? ❤ 😢
All Super Hero..boy and man,s
My sons mom has seizures thsmk god she is in prison so i dont have to ever worry about this
Be best to never ever drive if you know that you have a history of seizures… make the right decision from the beginning and avoid any tragedy in the future…
Thank God and I pray for the family and everyone that was involved 🙏🏾🙏🏾❤ Thanks to the little boy and the bystander officer too God Bless Them forever Amen 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
And then the cop arrested everyone. Illegal parking
Oh heart wrenching!!!
Karen in the making😂
It’s his job not really good people but still same consept
What was it the one man handed to the other guy?
“She’s having a seizure, she sunk!” “Is somebody in there?”
🙏🏻🙏🏻Thank God for the quicking thinking of that young man trying to get help and for All  saving that lady's life🙏🏻
Father God is so amazing thank you God for blessing them all. One Love 🌹🤎🙏🇬🇳🇧🇷🇬🇳
Thank God for those who saved her and she will forever cherish  this child; he will live with this forever. Thank God she is alright.
Heroes
Meinen Respekt für diese menschliche Leistung💯
Many’s thanks 🙏🏽 for the humanity  police man serving peoples 🙌🏾
He sounded like it was a bother to help.hust the tone of his voice makes him sound irritated.he and the bystander did a good thing saved a life.regardless and that's all that matti
the little boy saved his moms life not the cop the little boy ran from the car with his mom fast enough to find help getting her out tell the help where she was to get her and the cop is the hero when it was another man in the water already getting trying to get her out before the cop ask 21 questions to get in the water🤔
Lil Man is a Hero.
Thanks Lord for protecti g them
Your You a Hero ❤
they should’ve been rescuing her with a little bit more urgency
Everybody is a 'woke citizen "  Until they really need help Respect your local police department folks  They are human too  But most importantly they are real heroes folks 😞🙏
Why was he asking if someone was in there when the kid just told him the details?
I just couldn't imagine, Blessings to that family
Officer moving so slow continuing on asking dumb questions
That was a terrifying moment for that kid.
Wow his little cry was so desperate😢
That poor little boy , 😢😢😢 I hope their both OK now ❤
❤I am in tears
I thank God this trooper care an took the chance to risk his own life to help this lady at this point all hands on deck when driving we have to pay attention an the passengers have to pay attention as well an make sure the driver is alert anything could happen I pray she is doing well 🙏
Thank you Law enforcement 💙
❤❤❤❤
Felt tears on my eyes just by looking at the boy 😢
People who have seizures are legally forbidden from driving for this reason. Id imagine that makes life nearly impossible
What a Horror!
Appreciate the first hero whom was alone & incredible. Maximum Respect to the officer. Big up the son for finding help. May Yahusha protect & love.
The little boy told him that his mom was in the car but he still walking up to the pond asking "is she in there"
God bless you guys abundantly thank youuuuuuu God .
" is there somebody in there? .... I mean.... there's this kid in a panic...... but I don't want to get wet...... is there anybody in there? "  Take your time, officer nice guy..... she ain't  going anywhere.
Umm..it looks like the sin was doing the adults job..smh......asking if someone is in there.....he already said there was....and he took his sweet time helping her
Get somebody in there?! How bout doing your fuckin job dude!
That cop should have been in there!
Is that guy seriously that stupid he asking for her to answer him and asking if the door unlocked like it matters under water I don't believe this video noway
Wow prayers 🎉 my mom died this way. 😢
Glad those 3 helped that woman but god damn that cop moved hella slow but in the end he hwlped and thays good but god damn imagine the narrative if she died people be like as you can see this officer was not enthused
Well there went her DL. That sucks…
Kudos 2da boy gettin help 4 his Mother, da Police Officers, all Medical Personnel involved, and dat GOOD SAMARITAN GENTLEMAN on da scene 4 his help, Dats what America is bout🇺🇲🙏🏽🇺🇲...Amen God Bless u 4 all ur Heroism...😀💯👍🏾
Thank God for Good Samaritans!  I'm sure that baby is traumatized but he's a hero at the same time May God bless them🎉❤
The poor child is beyond afraid and rightly so. I hope all ended well
Literally my worst nightmare!! Glad to hear she survived. Praying for healing! ❤️‍🩹🙏🏾
That KID saved his moms and the cop didn’t rescue her, someone else did. Let’s not give fake credit to a man who literally didn’t do anything
BLESSINGS ❤️ 🙏 🙌
Thank u Sir !! ur a true Hero, may da MOST HIGH BLESS u & ur Family alwayz, ur action of Heroism will be divinely rewarded...Amen🙏🏽 dat's is what being an American is about, comin thru 4 ur Fellow Citizens in need🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
He is  an idiot, the kid is dripping wet and he is asking is someone in there!!
Glad everyone is okay, God is good 😢🙏🏽
That cop did NOT wana go in that water!!  His tone of voice says it ALL!!
The child is more interested in rescuing his mom. You heard him state “Hurry, she’s in there.  My mom is in there” as the car continues to sink. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
This brave, beautiful boy 😢 Thank God for him 🙏🏾 ❤😢
Two absolutely amazing heroes ❤ God bless you!
Did she live
They all are SOSO amazing ❤❤❤❤
My heart was breaking for the kid because the cop was apprehensive about helping since the kids black. That means the mom was black too.
did the cop want her to die why would he be so slow to help
Kid is telling the cop to help his mom in the car and he was like is somebody there? and hesitating to look for someone to help!😢
The cop is slow.
Why did Momma launch that car into a body of water? That isn’t the kind of thing that happens often.
Thank you Jesus
Need more of these videos circulating.. the videos where police are heroes, not reacting to an instigator trying to provoke a reaction, just doing a good job.
I have seizures and the last year they've been so bad it's several a week and several cluster seizures in 1 day. The dangers we can have around is are as bad & worse than the seizures. Falling down & sustaining injury....being somewhere that someone could rob or take advantage of...... holding a baby or having a gas stove on. The list goes on & on.  That poor little guy's breath was fighting against his ❤ trying to get his words up.
Geeze wth he dang sure didnt rush did he
That boy loves❤❤❤his mama ❤❤good to hear you guys are ok
Thank God the officer was around to help even though he appeared to be dragging his butt. Nevertheless, thanks be to God for his miracle working power to quicken and restore her to complete health, and wholeness .  Bless strengthen and keep the heart and mind of the baby boy in perfect peace. In Jesus name
The way the cop was procrastinating 🙄 the boy literally had to yell at him to save her after he already told him his mom was in there smh
WAY TO GO HERE GUYS , HEROES  AT  WORK  👍🙏
The bravery of this child is astounding I love it . His cries to save his momma pure love❤
Cop didnt wanna get his uniform wet.
And i keep hoping for the day I'd get the all clear that I can now drive.  Seizures are not good at all.
GOD has a beautiful plan for that young Man. May GOD'S Loving kindness continue to fill his Heart. Peace
What do we pay cops for?  Seems to be in no rush.
Maybe have them fill out a police report and show proof of identity and then the cop will "spring" into action.
are you telling the truth black kid? Are you sure? I still don't believe you well okay, let me see but I'm going to take my time just in case.
Why is she driving knowing she has  seizures
Omg that poor baby. I’m so glad everyone’s ok
Well.Done...to BOTH..of You..!!!!
“License Registration & Proof of Insurance” “Can you roll the window down for me a lil”
Poor baby. Scary to imagine for a kid going through this. I hope mom survived. God bless everyone who helped
So laid back, about it geez no
Very brave young man
Blessings ❤❤
Cop playing slow i see. Every minute is critical
Oh Baby! 🙏🏽💞🙏🏽
Was that a damn fish??
You can tell he was running for HER life.  Poor thing could barely talk, but he got the important info out just fine.  That looked like a long lonely road. 😢
Praise God!
God bless this precious boy . Hope his moms ok .
Aww bless this boy, i hope momna was ok in the end ❤😢
Prayers for the family 🙏 Bless them ❤
Evil will always be in this world, but faithful communities with Good Samaritans/Citizens are the Glue that holds are communities together. The Harvest is Plenteous, but the Laborers are Few! Pray that God send more Laborers, more Good Samaritans, more Good Citizens, so that the USA can be an example for all to model!🎉🙏🇺🇸♥️🤍💙
Oh my god wow that is intense.
Whenever I pass a body of water, I roll my windows down!!!
Is somebody in there? Hello do u not hear the little boy screaming for his mom?
She must've panicked the water seems only knee deep
The cop wasnt urgent enough about saving the woman’s life. The kid told him “she sunk, she’s in the water having a seizure”  And he gets the car and yells “is somebody in there?” … seriously? And then a civilian had to go and save her because the cop was clearly hesitant…. Wow.  I know you don’t want to get wet today sir, but saving a life is more important than your dry cleaning.
Is somebody in there? Yes, he told you - HIS MOM!
he saved his mother's life that day😢❤
Anything known how they are doing?
Great job son and officer 💯
What a horrible situation.
Brave young man! ❤❤❤❤
Is somebody in there, he just told you what's going on
“HELP HER!”  Well said boy. Like hurry tf up dude
Poor kid he so dis stressed.
Why did the cop ask him again if someone was in there when that was the first thing he said was his mom is in there having a seizer
The title should be Kid safes his mom.
The kid. My heart. Be alright  please.
Oh, so touchy this boy is calling his Mama. I hope sge is okay and get helped.😢
he was moving wayyy too slow
Wow amazing ❤❤❤ what a great son
Hes like no way im going in there until i verify someone is in there😊
Her son said she  having a seizure so they'd have to treat  for that and water on her lungs aswell  hopefully she did not have hyperthermia
The desperation. Poor sweet boy and momma.
😢😢😢😢W O W😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
❤ Adonia blessings to that brake man
You think of the kid was a different color they would have hopped in the water faster
I think in swimming pool they should do life saving with cars so family's no how to open the door or window and swim free it would save lives so much more and change the seat belts so when in water they can free themselves differently by releasing the safety belt if it comes stuck like make the top part go in to each other with a easy press to get out of it easier similar to a baby seat where you press the button and it undoes it would save lives quicker my idear not anyone else's
Why do cops ask such stupid ass questions
The police sound like "why me"!!!
God was present that is for sure😢
He is not a good Samaritan he is doing what he gets paid to do. Protect and serve although I commend him even tho he asking dumb questions like is she in there. Naw I'm just standing in murky water beside a care thats nose in.....😮
Awesome job!!! The little boy was amazing as well. God bless them!!!
Thank you . Good person ❤
Why isn't this in the main stream media? A southern state too, aren't we supposed to be the worst ones?
What a brave kid, his actions saved his Mum ❤
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Thank EMS, for Being; Thank You!
"is somebody in there" 😂😂😂
Cars are death traps she was very lucky that poor child bless them
I'm sorry but I'm really disgusted at the rate of pace the cop showed in this video... obviously it's not the full video & I don't mean to jump to conclusions, there could be a lot more that shows heroics and care but based solely off this short video it seemed he really showed lack of care... that kid obviously was saying there's somebody in there & she was having a seizure and help her help her etc.... no kind of racing into the waters, took what felt like a long time to check the door was locked... so okay the doors locked/can't open- okay how about a thought of maybe just break the back window and get her out😢
Thank you, Officer..
Bless him, the pain in his cries just breaks my heart! Good job little man for getting out and getting help!! So glad you are all ok!!
Jesus Christ mental
What a blessing.  That road looks pretty empty.  The officer was in the right place at the right time.  Thank you Lord almighty Jesus.
„Is somebody in there?“ blubblublub 🫧?!!
Thank God for all who help save the lady. God places angels  around just when you needs them the most. Bless everyone who involved  in save this young man mom. Bless the mom for recovering and keep her son safe.
Omggg I'm glad she ok ,thank God for her son getting someone to help ,you are truly Blessed,,Amen...❤
When a chold learned  to swim this may happened.  His swimming  skill help him to get out of the car and run to get help for his mom. May God bless them and hope his mom made it.
What a hero ❤❤❤😢 god job young man , you saved ur mama !
Am I the only one bothered by that lackadaisical attitude? Like what do you mean is there anybody in there? The car is in the water sir.....  Mr. First Reaponder. .. why even stand there and ask? Like you think you're going to hear an answer?
Bless his heart hope all is well😢
🙏❤🙌❤️🙏💪💪
God bless this family what a brave son❤ xxxxxxxxxx
That is the stupidest person to help
I can’t imagine being in this situation and filming it being any kind of priority. Unless it was an officer with a body cam. I’d want both hands free
Oh that baby
Don’t rush mate !!!
😮😮❤ Bless their hearts
Sending healing strength and prayers to this family. Son, your Mama is going to be okay once she heals. You did awesome she is going to be so proud of you 💓... You did awesome. Thank you to those that came to help this young man and his Mama in their extremely desperate time of need. 🙏🙏🙏
This baby loves his Mom.  ❤ God bless the good samaritan!  Let's not forget him.
Praise God good she is doing ok God bless her and her son❤❤
Man id be afraid that an alligator be waiting for me
GOD is GOOD ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wonder if it was the cops wife or child would he have been taking his sweet time like he was in this situation
That poor, beautiful baby, I am crying my eyes out hearing and seeing his anguish. He saved her life that day. God put those people in the right spot at the right time. God Bless All of Them. 💜💜💜💜💜
I hate that boy had to go through that Being traumatized at such a young age I hope he didn't break his foot This kills me.....I am so happy his mother made it I can't imagine the fear and  Terror that boy was feelingHe was so  brave and courageous to go back in that water not knowing what he was going to find😢
Child please that cop was taking his sweet and precious time he had no hurry in him🙄argue by yourself
Cop didn’t save shit
How did that baby even get out?! He’s soaking wet meaning he saved his own life, ran and found help quick enough that this cop and random person were able to save his mothers life as well. I hope he gets the support /therapy he deserves for his heroic actions and quick thinking. That’s something the community should provide free of charge to kids in situations like this. He saved two lives, the least we can do is help him get thru this trauma. I’d much rather tax payers money go towards that than into already rich peoples pockets.
Did she make it. OMG that poor child❤
Damn, could the Cop have moved any slower? 😢
Thank the Lord she was rescued!!! Amen!!!
I feel auto self drive is useful in this case. People prone to fits etc can use this to be safe !
Her son save her life she should be very thankful of him and for him he's her lifesaver
😭😭😭😭
Thank you God
God bless them all. Poor baby knew he might loose his mom . ❤
What are we looking at…. ?
Good son got help fast...
You would expect more urgency from a police officer.
São ambos herois❤
Thank God in heaven and his people he uses without them not even knowing it
Looks like she tried to kill her self and the kid
Cop's nickname is (snail) 🐌
Dumb yt mfs didn't want to save his mom smh
Thank God for this rescue 🙏🏽
The fact that the boy was clearly in the accident as well but sucked it up to save his mother.  He was so BRAVE
The cop didn't move like he was worried smh
Be healed in the Name of Jesus!
Thank you ti those brsve men that saved her
I felt like the cop was moving in slow motion.
Kudos to the man that was in the water, not asking questions, and just following his natural instinct of being great human! The officer that wanted to know if the car was unlocked before he even started to walk towards the water and asked if there’s even anybody in there like do you think this little boy crawled out of that car from driving it his self get your fucking pigs can’t swim in the water right now type shit
Omg thank goodness shes safe! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 Good job son! Good job guys!
The kids saved his momma
Why no description??? Hate when you do this,,, 🥵🥵🥵😞😞😞😞😞😞
Thank you Sir
❤😢
😮😮😮😮😮
The fucking cop really didn’t want to go in the water he see it’s under water and say can anybody here me the boy keep telling him his mother is in there then it takes for a another cop to get the job done like it was supposed to be done in da first place
Why is the cop taking so slow
Many prayers for a full recovery for her! I have a seizure disorder and am terrified to drive anyplace long distance, I fear maybe even injuring others more! But seizures go unnoticed by I’ll it happens and sometimes dehydration causes seizures poor baby he is her hero
Thank you King JESUS I ❤❤❤❤❤❤ you!!!!!!!!!!😊
“Good samaratin” THATS HIS MOM !!!!!! 💪🏾  that wasn’t nun to him , he jus did what he thought he was supposed to
Prayers for her survival. Great job young man 🙏
That cops reaction was ridiculously slow.
All white people aren’t evil or bad❤❤
Did he escapee the car?
Is someone in there? What do you think he stopped you for?
We still need our cops especially with millions of unknown
YAHWEH ❤
What a brave young man , good to know his mama is doing ok.  When you see the police helping here and  then see what abuse police get from drunk drivers that breaks my heart too. 😢
That poor child.
Thanks to  the Samaritan and the police officer she’s alive thank God
Is sure is funny how the devil exposes himself when the light shows up.  - he should have called EMS first thing then all he said was tell EMS step it up. - you can hear the shakiness in voice  -poor little baby about to lose his breath in this f****** cop copped acting like a SNAKE
That cop needs to learn how to hustle that was some lollygaggin ass shit considering a woman was drowning in her car
She’s tried to kill them.
That cop is making me mad 😡 🤬 why was he moving really slow. The kids already told him she was in the car sinking, why would he need to stop and keep asking. And the cop asked rudely i might add. What an a$$hole cop.
He hesitated way too much
Ok. Maybe we'd all like to know how the car ended up in the water in the first place? Just asking!
Praise God for saving this boy so he could save his Momma.  Thought I heard him say Mom had a seizure which caused the car to go off road.   Poor baby is so scared for his Momma!  Just hearing the child crying for help just broke my heart for him
Ce jeune homme est un vrai héros. Un grand merci à ces policiers pour leur secours très rapide. Dieu soit loué.
She is ok now she😢 lives with me now and we are moving on and we just had another baby and thanks for your support. 😂🎉❤😂
Little man stepped up. Fine young man there. He's being raised right. Well done. And son, you're your moms hero. Always protect her. Proud of you and love you. Great job.
Cops asked the dumbest questions.  Is there someone In there? Yes!! That's why he came to get you...
Poor baby
True heroes!
yes,  officer. we got all day and night to save her omg 🙃
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Why u ask somebody is there. just check the car ok if u really want to help
That cop needs to step it up. Why the fuck was he asking if anyone was in the car while the car is in the water, unbelievable.... Im glad that the son was brave and strong enough to get out an help, also that random stranger too.
Lost signal. GPS said turn left and speed up.. SPLASH.---Glad they are safe
No one is talking abiut how dag on long it took and how many of times over & over to get the window breaker to work! What a joke. Companies got to do better. Especially if their making life saving devices
LORD RESTORE, RECOVER, HEAL AND SHOW YOURSELF MIGHTY FAITHFUL AND STRONG, SURELY YOU ALLOWED HER TO BE SAVED FOR A REASON, FOR YOUR GLORY, BE MERCIFUL MY LORD IN JESUS NAME AMEN AND AMEN
Thank goodness for this little boy bravery. Prayer for his mother may she fully recover from her seizure and the accident. 🙏❤️‍🩹
Kid knows she is having a seizure which means mom knows she has seizures and still drives. Luckily she didn't hurt someone innocent. There is a reason we tell you you can't drive after a diagnosis.
Poor baby! Im so glad there was a police officer there!!❤
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
A woman driver?  Why am I not surprised?
Praying for her thanks to her son
poor dodge 😢😢😢
That cop didn’t jump in straight away ! First he said is the car unlocked … 🙄 acting like he don’t wanna get wet ! Tf
I am glad they are ok
Orange Tx yup you know there is gators 🐊 in there
Is it me or is this cop too nonchalant and slow about this emergency. And why is he yellin “is someone in there?”, just hurry up and dive in, the whole car is practically underwater
Is the car unlocked? As he slowly walks into the water. Wow.
The child already said that his mom is in there. Why keep yelling and asking as if the person can respond and hear underwater?
This cop. Hears this kid paniced and saying he needs help his mom is stuck in the water. And his ass plays dumb. " is she in there" " is anyone in there" no fucking urgency. God forbid he gets wet to save someones life. Takes his sweet ass time. Thank god for the other guy. No telling what type of inaction the cop would hace taken.
The guy asking is somebody in there annoyed me bad!! He expected a response from someone who was drowning!? 🙄

Dieu merci un homme courageux est intervenu ! Merci à lui 🏅
Is somebody in there? Like wtf u think the little boy ran to you for
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
God bless them all ♥️
Geez, that cop's reaction time is slow mo.
😇😇😇😇😇
Never in a crisis life or death moment have I seen such an un reluctant officer , their main job is to protect life .
I wish they blurred that babies face. When did it become ok to publicize children especially in such vulnerable times. Sending prayers to the family. I hope mom is ok. This young man is a hero.
He just said she was in there, you don't just shout is she in there you move a bit faster.
This really breaks my  💔 what a brave son he really saved his mom God bless 🙏 them and the man who got her out of that vehicle two Heros in one day..  😢💐
So am following it correctly. Did the cop sent the child again in the water?
Even in all consuming panic, little man articulated exactly what needed to be said. Praying for both mom and him. Incredible courage.
The kid said someone is in there and he just stands there and yells to see if someone is in the car 😅
I had the same reaction when my mom had a seizure, I feel his concern through the screen😭
Wow OMG 😊❤❤❤❤❤
I'm glad the woman is okay, but  this cop is not a good samaritan, that's literally his job and once they're at the car he stands there and asks if someone's in there like dude go look , didn't want to get his nice clean pants wet
Oh God help
Is anyone in there ? Cop actually asked after kid frantically says someone stuck
How we respond in desperate times is something to be proud about when you have been through a tough time
The child knows what a seizure is. This makes me wonder why the mother was driving at all if she has a history of seizures(?). Lucky they are alright now.
Swimming 🏊‍♀️ is a must!
Poor kid.  😢.
It’s sad how this police officers kept saying is she in there? Is she in there come on bro the kid just came out the car you can tell he’s wet. Wow God sees your heart and his a true attention.
A Good Samaritan cop saving This Girl's Life in this goddamn or a woman on the witness God the Angels always stepping and you never know where they are when they come in I hope to be okay loving this car the name of Jesus🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🤔😊
That kid saved his Mums life bless him!!
Praying 🙏 for mother recovery:and her son, Thank God for the police officer and her dear son!
With all the wickedness and inhumane people on earth of all races, it touches my heart when another human does good for another.  Thanks goes out to the  loving, humane police officers who heard the  frantic plea of a little boy, who desparately needed to save his mother having a seizure , from drowning.  I know many policemen have demonstrated how heartless they are, and these wonderful human beings, policemen 🎉deserve to be recognized.❤❤❤Love Is A Beautiful Action.
The problem are cars who close themself. They don't open up and pp, can't be rescued. Shit car industry.
Defund the police has put lot of good man out of job which involves high risk. There will alwags be 1 to 2% bad ones in any work force or society. Glad they are safe and kid lives to tell the tale.
Poor baby.. how terrifying for him. Prayers to the family 🙇🏽‍♀️🙏🏽
🩷🩷🩷
😢😢😢😢The fear in his eyes
What a wonderful young man who for sure has made his mother proud ❤ Blessings to them both.
"is the car unlocked?" Bitch walk four steps into the water and check the door.
You know I'm not trying to be unkind but people that have seizures are not allowed to drive. Unfortunately she put her children at risk and that is not cool look at the trauma. I pray for her to get a full recovery. I also pray that she uses better judgment and at least doesn't drive with children in her car or any other person.
Thank yall. Prayers she made it that lil baby was so smart and scared. Omg praying for yall. Thank you to those that responded quickly
The cop was taken  his damn time.
Stay strong God bless 🙏🏾✝️
Seems like there wasn't quite the initial urgency this situation deserved 🧐
"Tell EMS to step it up"...they aren't sightseeing on the way, good grief
Thank you, the kind person who found out the full story for us. We needed to know.
Kinda hate that sound ..personally
Poor baby is going to be watching his mama like a hawk now and when she has another seizure, because unfortunately she probably will, he's either going I've way or the other: i got this I've done it before, or oh no not again😢😢
This poor baby!!! Oh my goodness his screams hurt my heart.
The child will never foget this frightful time. Lord please keep blessing them.❤
Omg! This child, 😳 how frightening! Heavenly Father I hope she’s ok! Please let her be ok!
I saved a drunk driver lady just like this.  In florida.  In a pond. Literally just like this. The gators were curious i didn't even care about the gators.  But i saved her life.  We have 3 kids now
A little slower guys. Ask more questions that he literally told you in panic dhe second he saw you!!! This pisses me off. Its a miracle sjes even ok!! Tsk 😡
He told you shes in there why ask if someone is in
I pray to Jesus that this mother survived & has or will make a full recovery! That sweet boy needs his momma for many, many more years! My heart just broke for him! I cannot even imagine the fear corsing through his veins in that moment. I'm just overwhelmed with emotions and pride. He took control even in a state of emmense panic and did exactly what he needed to do in this situation! Amazing young man! I know his momma is proud!! 🥲💕🙌🏻
God is Good he was brave to escape and help his mom  🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Omg ..The Heart Break at that  Moment, God Bless all you kids, Not Even your time to leave them Sweet Momma ❤❤
Dudes wasting so much valuable time asking if someone’s in the damn car, no shit dude, the kid just told you that.
My older brother had a seizure while I drove us back home in his car. It was his car he should have been driving. Driving home from a funeral. Hope she is ok.
Thank God for those that helped
This what i mean when cops be on slow. The boy told you she in there suffering a seizure. His ceazy self asking out loud is any body in😖😠 there? From waaay back. Of course shes in there. 🫨Hurry up!
An Angel always around us  to help  in different ways,🙏🙏❤❤
God always have the right people in the right place at the right time. God bless you, kind sir, for helping them. You are a true hero.
I thank God  for o r t ha t man who risk his life to help him she should not be driving  thank God no one got killed  etc❤❤❤
She’s alive. “She spent more than three weeks on a ventilator but is recovering well” the article said
That little boy just broke my heart he's so scared for his mom. Happy to hear she was finally ok.
Why are you yelling is somebody in there...the child just told you his Mum was in there 😳🙄
That baby 😮😢😢😢
Poor baby... praying shes ok.. I cant swim and almost drowned so hearing that gurgling of the water made me nauseous...
Bless that babies Lil heart!!
So brave ❤
The cop was way too slow. That Good Samaritan really saved that woman.
That baby boy just broke me! He’s so out of breath trying to save his mum 😢 bless his wee heart ❤
Omg that poor baby ☹️ his cries and screams for his mom were in pain. I hope she makes it and he can have his mom back home very soon.
That darling boy and how he got the help needed to save his mum really touched me. Good to hear Mum is slowly recovering x
Blessings
Oh my goodness that poor boy
talking bout sum is somebody in there… the boy is literally pleading that someone needs help.. that someone being his mother. cops just be acting dumb asf
“Is she in there….. is somebody in there?”   The son BEEN SCREAMING THAT HIS MOM IS IN THERE I feel like this cop took too much time, every half second matters when you’re under water!!!
Damn that's scary that poor kid but at least they're alive
Oh s***
Dum ass cop. Just standing there is someone there
Thank God you got help for your Momma young man! You saved her life, I pray she's ok now!!! I pray you're ok as well, you're a hero, as well are the officer and good bystander! May God richly bless you ALL for your valor & love to help another, beside yourself!
Him just standing there asking if someone was there pissed me tf off…like that little boy just said that his mom was having a seizure and is drowning 🤨
What kind of dumb ass question is that ?Boy says my mother's in there, Officer says is somebody in there.(Repeatedly)ughhhhhh..
the boy will always remember this stranger & policeman for the rest of his life.
Thanks for stepping it up for this family
My god😢
God bless the young man  AMEN 🙏🏿
Pig was a coward really didn't want to help at all! It took a civilian to jump in that water and try to rescue the woman!!
Cries of a desperate child to save his momma answered.
Father God, I pray for a speedy recovery and like new recovery for this mother a child needs her and I know you’re not ready for her yet and Jesus name a like new recovery for this mother and Jesus name and stand on your promises yes and amen hallelujah
My God a child's cry for his mother just broke my heart!!🥺😭
You can hear that poor woman screaming and still asking if there's somebody in there? Are you freaking serious right now??????????
“Is she in there? Is somebody in there?”After a frantic WET boy just told you she in the water.  🤦🏾‍♀️
Awe… I feel so badly for that Child. Was the Mother alright? ♥️♥️♥️
Ok
That glass doesn’t break anymore with those hammers and they sell a very small device that is supposed to break it and the electric locks don’t work when wet. All of these fancy features are deadly, give me a window that rolls dow n and a lock that pulls up to open, old fashioned is best. Please bring back safety not push button. Better to gave glass that breaks into rolly poly pieces.
That poor baby!!! 😢
This cops sucks
Thank God she’s survived speedy recovery 🙏🙏🙏🙏
OMG 😭 that poor baby beating on that window trying to save his mama 😭
God Bless that child and that Officer.
People want to defund the police right cause everyone hates cops? Amazing how this won't make the news. Cops save lives all day, but nope always have to show them in a bad light.  never what they do to save lives. Not afraid of the cops now when u want ur life saved. I hope that young man grows up to be a cop and realizes not all cops are bad.
Thank you ❤❤❤
Poor child ,that trauma naver gonna leave his mind ,
😢😢 🥺 everyone did an amazing job! ❤❤❤❤
I'm glad to know my son would've saved my life aswel but differently he would've pulled me out to safety what a VERY BRAVE son to get out tread the water without fear TO GET HELP FOR HIS MAMA🖤🙏🏿🙌🏿☝🏿🖤🙏🏿✝️🤷🏿‍♀️💯🌻🎉🎉🎉💙🩵👣👣💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE COVERED BY THE BLOOD ❤.  PRAISE FOR THE MOST HIGH FOR THE SON, COP, AND BYSTANDER ❤.
Respectfully that cop took too long to take action... how did we let our country turn into this its part my fault for excepting less then we deserve. God please open hearts so we can be who you ment us to be... he couldn't be bothered that kid was desperate respectfully cudos to him for saving her life though 🤔  over wieght white cop nost likly a good man but come on people how do i know what he looks like and never seen him. Little boy was a man that day
That poor boy. My goodness, my heart breaks for him. He thought he lost his momma. He's his momma's hero for being able to get help for her in time. You can tell how much he loves her by how frightened he was when he thought he might lose her.
That little boy, his cry for help. The desperation in his voice was heartbreaking.  Any updates? Is mom ok?
Amazing little fella and thank them for saving his mom
Poor baby I hope his moms ok . Glad those wonderful men came to help
Why the cop so damn slow
Wow so he knew he had to get out and take a chance at getting help but at the same time had to leave them very brave wow!
Why is the cop so slow and calm, and asking all those questions. Just get in the water and save her.
GOD bless you❤❤❤
🙏🙏🙏🙏
😭😭😭💔💔💔
Amazing kid. Amazing cop. Does anyone know the outcome?? I hate these nonclosure videos
I also have seizures  and although😂 i never think about  one under the wheel I’m so sad I’ll never get behind the wheel without much of my family knows I’m out there knows I’m out there.  Please heed the drs orders.  I’ve been paid for it many times. I don’t see the danger and  will continue.  Please don’t be bash me.  Just pray😊😊😊
Do anybody one knows his name the officer?❤
That poor kid is going to be traumatized for life. I hope he gets some counseling after that!!
Protect all children 😢😢😢
That boys composure in those moments unbelievable
Still, thank you cop for being there to help.
The cop was supper relax
NOW SEEING A RESPECTABLE POLICE OFFICER IN THIS VIDEO DON'T GET 5 MILLION VIEWS BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING NEGATIVE IT WOULD HAVE. THANK YOU IN SALUTE
So effn scary. I have epilepsy and that boy is so amazing. Omg 😢. Hope she's OK
This.   Person.   Is.    Kind.   For.    Helping. His.   Mom.   Out.    God.   Bless.   Him.  Amen.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
A blessing that he found a cop on the streets ❤ hope the mom has a speedy recovery
Cop was so freaking slow wtf ! “Is anyone in there” pfttt u could tell he’d rather her die then go in the water
Did she survive?
I can't imagine God bless them all I hope everyone was oky
Thank God they were there ❤ good men ❤❤
God BLESS all of you who HELPED THE BOY& SAVED HIS MOM🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💕💝💞💖 🤜🏼🤛🏼🏆🏅🎖🎖God Bless you
He knew she was having a seizure. She must have seizures therefore she is not supposed to be driving and that is why right there what happened?
That kid is so brave!
She shouldn't be driving the town should give one of her kids a driver's permit to get around
Thanks for the caps.
This child gave his mom the gift of life right back . What an amazing little hero may God bless them always .
Poor kid is traumatized.  I hope it all works out.
Bless you all 🙏🏾
Omg🙏
Bless them and that boy!
Oh that precious child, breaks my heart to hear the panic in their voice. I pray the mother survived.
Nothing like a love from a child
🎉😅❤ smart young man I no mother proud of her son.
is somebody's in there ? really taking your sweet little time while they could die is not a hero .
Some cops are just plain clueless sometimes.
I'm sorry but that cop had no rush.
O my God, that just broke my heart!  Thank God for them all.
Did she make it?
Oh, GOD. Poor Baby Boy.
Unfortunately, due to a major oversight on the part of car manufacturers, when a car submerges and the electrics short out, the doors and windows can’t be unlocked and trap the victims inside to drown.
*THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING!* That little boy had to beg for that piece of trash to get in the water and help his mom. Thank God for that little boy! And SHAME on that pathetic excuse for a cop!
Awesome ❤❤❤❤❤
God Bless this youngster and cop They are true heroes ❤ 🙏,🤗 and ❤❤, Arkansas 🙏
It must be scary having epilepsy and driving cars
Sorry but cops asking if she In there when lil boys already Told cop his Mamas In the car!!?? Plus lil boys all Wet, frantic, etc .....Cops moving Real Slow like he dont wanna get wet or Save A LIFE!!!💔
This cop is a hero? 🤨 He couldn't have possibly had a more, "Damn...You mean I have to actually work AND get wet?!?' attitude and tone. He didn't care at all until that Good Samaritan was in the water and he realized what a piece of trash he would look like. Disgusting.
Praise be to God.
My heart 💔💔💔💔💔
Poor baby! That must have been terrifying. Thank goodness someone was there to get her out right away!
Thank you 🙏 Jesus that young boy act fast and saved his mama I hope.😇😭🙏😭
My heart breaks for this young boy! He knew what to do! God bless all involved 🙏🏼♥️🙏🏼
To serve and protect
Him asking if someone is in there kinda made me mad I'm not gone lie... But I'm happy he helped
Cop has iq of 35
🥺🥺
No more driving for dummy. Even the kid knew she had seizures. Smh
That cop is the least heroic hero I have ever see, he was hesitant to get in the water and he hollered three times "is there somebody in there". Dude get to that car and FIND OUT the kids panic alone tells you someone is in that car.
It took the officer so long to get going. He was so blasé about it… Is there someone in there? YES, THERE IS SOMEONE IN THERE! THAT IS WHY THE BOY CAME TO YOU!!! The poor child is pleading with you to save her! Instead of trying the locked door 100 times, smash the window open!! Call for back up call an ambulance. This poor baby boy was trying to save his mama! The officer giving us all heart attacks. I wonder if she was okay?!? He gets her out and says, “Put her over there”… Did he call someone to sit with the child? Because I saw that poor baby in the water trying to get his mother out. This was handled poorly I think… 😥
God's tymin thru&thru in Jesus name ❤
Praise God!!! People diagnosed with epilepsy.....please do not drive unless your doctor has cleared you!!!
Great job lil man. You helped save your momma. You're a hero.
Cop had no urgency
😢 I pray she is ok
❤️😊❤
Seemed like cop took his dam time also he’s telling out loud of anyone’s in there!!!! What’d you think the kid just told you his mom was in the car just had a seizure 🙄
Boy saved his mamas life. Do you know how many sons out here wish they got there in time?
❤❤  call counter. God loves you.
What an idiot! Is someone in there? Did this idiot cop think the mom was going to pop her head up and say, "yeah!, I'm in here!"
Yahweh ❤
Omg thank you Jesus she was rescue!!!!!
This cop had no initiative. Like of course someones in there wtf are you asking. Do something.
Omg 🙏
STOP ASKING TOOO MANY danG ????S and help that woman
🙏🙏🙏
First thing! This officer was pathetic! He really had no sense. Hes asking if someones in the car? Are you kidding me??
How about kuddos to the people that saved her too!
I'm confused - not saying my mama and she's in water but coo asking if anyone in there. Where's the running to the car? Seconds count.
Is that the kid back in the water
He will know forever NOT ALL cops are bad.
That poor kid is so scared.
God bless mom, son and the man who helped ❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
To me, he really didn't Wana help.
It's crazy how fast he would of been there if she had a gun or drugs on her but casually walks n water to help
❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤
🥺  🙏🏾 Bless them all! That's so brave!
HOW DRAMATIC 😢😢😢😢😢
Dam that shit was hard to see the kid so dam scared like thT but this is what you'd rather see more of being the times when cops are in the state of a God send
Thanks to everyone that help to get the woman out the car.  God Blessings on everyone.  Amen Amen 🙏🙏🙏 ❤❤❤
Protect and serve,,, Read your bible
The cop took too damn long whos in there my mom is anyone in there yea help her
This is so sad I hope the mom is ok cause I know how it feels my fiance as seizures all the time and know he can't drive a car anymore ❤❤❤
Poor sweet baby. I hope he gets through the mental trauma from this incident ok, and I hope the mom now knows to give up her license so something like this never happens again.
How tf he screaming is somebody in theire and he just told you She is tf😢
Thanks, blessings, and best wishes to the heroes who rescue his mommy❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The Cop did a good job but aint you  supposed to immediately jump in and not stand on the edge and go anybody in there specially if they underwater
Thanks to all that helped out
did his mom live??????
Kid knew just what to do ! but the  hesitation that the cop had really got the anxiety outta me !
Thank you God
Hellooo... is anybody in there? Somebody.... anybody? 😒
Gracias a los salvadores!!!
What a lousy video. You didn't show anything of the result. 👎
God Bless him and the officer who got straight in the water.
That young man touched my heart when he was trying to get help
Trauma just too much for kids. He was so brave and got help. Amen
Omg .. if you have that condition please don’t drive 🙏🏼
She should not be driving.. She need someone to drive her where they need to go.. Poor child will be forever traumatized... Her sister or somebody should be living with them. God watch over this child
Is the car unlocked? Wow
Thank you lord Jesus useing your people to save life Hallelujah Hallelujah amen 🙏🏾 psalm91 psalm23❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🔥🙏🏾❤️❤️🙏🏽✝️✝️🔥🔥🔥🩷🧡🧡♥️♥️⛽️💯🌹🌹🅰️🅰️🛡💜💖
That man moving in slow motion or is it just me 😮
God Bless the Mother & Son!  Thank you to the Cops & Emt workers!
The Cop didn't give a fuck.
Brave young man! He knew mom needed help and conveyed the urgency clearly ❤
God bless them 😢🙏
The back of your head rest on your car seat can be used to break a car window. FYI
EPILEPSY SUCKS
Thank God poor bb omg 😢😢😢😢
❤😢❤😢❤😢❤😢
👍🏼💯🙏🏽
Amazing bravery son. Good thing he knew her medical condition. Glad he was able to stop someone.
My heart is pounding! Mom you raised a remarkable son 💙❤️❤️❤️
I pray that they were able to save her 🙏🏾
Can that person be any slower asking if anyone is in there when that poor baby is crying pointing saying momma. Dear God
Thank God for that precious baby and the police officer. I pray she is ok. God bless the son and polive officer.
Thank Jesus for these men and this little boy's wisdom and courage 🙏 🎉🎉
Praise God
Poor little guy. My heart breaks for him. ❤
where are the cop haters????
That cop got on my damn nerves.
UPDATE PLEASE
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That poor child. I’m so glad she was rescued. Heartbreaking. What a brave and strong young man.
😮❤
Why would he ask him if the cats unlocked? What? Are you kidding? Who knows!
Cop had no urgency 😢 hope she's ok
Oh my goodness
Our kids loves us soooooo much ❤
Mother and child  💛
This Broke my Heart my tears came out see this Boy so Desperate crying out  save my mom, help her... What an intelligent fast  quick thinker, bless your heart little one .. your Mom Will be Sooo Proud of you for Saving her Life...May Jehovah God Bless you..❤❤
Praise God for the other man that took the initiative to get her out!!
Omg.. this just gave me anxiety like I was there
God bless them
Man I hope she is okay
THANK YOU OFFICER ❤❤❤❤
Idiotic to ask if someone's in there. Dude, just get in there. The amount of reluctance shouldnt wven name this good samaritan, cop hesitating rescue  🙄
That cop was slow as heck! 😢
When cop first got to the scene it was almost like he was contemplating for what seemed like a lifetime to that child, whether or not he really wanted to get wet. "Is she in there? Is        there somebody    in      there?"   Well fuck okay fine
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I pray she is alive and well😢
Bet they were glad the police weren’t defunded in this moment.
Did she survive?
WHO WAS FILMING THE WHOLE THING??
🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
GOD BLESS ALL OF Y'ALL.  😳😳🦾💪🙏🙏
This just pissed me off... the boy is pointing and screaming " HELP HER" & 🗣 u slowly moving questioning the kid like it's a damn traffic stop. Smfh " They don't care about us: ( those who get it get it) ain't no way. The way I would have been running as an officers just as the little boy was pointing " Baby sayless" that body cam would have been all water da fxxk up. 🤦🏾‍♀️ Glad he saved his mom 🙌🏾💛🥹🙌🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
There is a higher source that can only provide this devine intercede🙌🫶❤️
Blessings over the young man and police officer for responding quickly.❤
God bless you, Thank you Jesus Christ of Nazareth
If you see the full video I’m not sure she would have made it if it wasn’t for civilians. They jumped in because the cop was desperately slow, very frustrating.
Brave young boy . He went back in the water trying to help her.
My heart goes out to them.  God please protect them.
Is the car unlocked? Dude walk five more feet and check yourself. Dude was not acting with any urgency at all
Remember not to harass police officers with cameras, It's happening all too often
Why was that cop asking if anyone was in there? When the little boy already told him she's in there ?
O😮h my God 😢
I see many clips on YouTube where cops are dirty & uneducated. As a Black woman , I know there are a lot of cops like this one. The officer didn't hesitate. God bless him & his family and the family He helped rescue ❤😇🙏
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Jesus
How that child got out is by the grace of God! And helped save his mother’s life. God is good thank you Lord Jesus.
What’s wrong with that cop asking if she is in there when the kid is crying to save his mom that’s stuck in car
Brave boy, brave officer. Thank God for them both.
Why would the cop ask if there is someone in there, when the child clearly told the cop she was in there, plus I’m sure a woman under the water isn’t going to respond, “yes I’m here”
So from what I’m reading, I’m taking that the did save her.?
Why is he yelling "is somebody in there!" That baby wouldn't be crying desperately for his help... really 🙄
Err😅😢 the officer questioned,  stuck me
Great Job by the Kid, Police Officer and the Good Semeritain
Smart kid! Lord have mercy!!!😢
Oh my god.. I pray they are rescued. Bless you, officer and her Son !
Is she drowning?
We pay all that money for their swimming lessons and forget about our own.
To the wonderful officer that helped this child and saved his mother. Sir thank you for your compassion. May the universe send a mutitude of blessings  to you and your family. You Are amazing dear brother. 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Young man broke my heart. Respect to rescuers
God bless this young man 🙏
This child bring me to tears 😢❤mommy is only one 🙏
I hate to be that guy but why is she driving…
Fine thru 1000s of comments and found only one person thanks the cop, if the cop was not able to save her I m sure there would be 1000s of comments saying he’s a racist officer he didn’t help her . Atleast be kind and respectful to everyone and praise them when they deserve it .
He new what she was having, so other situations happened before meaning she shouldn't have been driving, my GF I a #1 diabetic and went low while driving, she hit a tree she didnt get hurt but her license was taken, until multiple specialist sighned off to get her license back which took dam near 2 yrs. even big rig drivers lose their license if they get one seizure, and that's if it even happens at home. so she was most likely driving without a license and putting that child in danger.
To God be all the glory
Bless his heart
God bless you and your family little boy! You did the right thing! ❤❤
Sir you're a walking Blessing
The police officer was so stupid keep asking is she in the car she in the car he just told you multiple times she’s in there drowning
Praying for that little boy! How traumatizing that had to be for him. 😔 that baby grew up that day.  Amazing job little man, no hesitation to find help, kept your composure enough to communicate proficiently,  ran your little butt right back out in that water trynna help them get her  out that car. Your momma is so lucky to have you❤❤
Boy, I would hope law enforcement could be faster than that.
That poor little boy will  never forget THAT  or   The help of that Police  OFFICER ❤
Oh.. that sweet baby… he was so scared but he did such a good job. I can’t imagine how I would feel as an adult.. let alone a little kid… good job, bub. You saved your momma.
Bless his heart ❤..poor baby 😢.. what a AMAZING JOB HE DID SAVING HIS MAMMA❤❤❤
Cold water what water good on you both especially you little man
God bless this young and cops who saved them 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🫢
🙏🏾🤍🙏🏾
Is it just me or was the cop just taking his sweet time?? Was he telling the child to break the window?? And if so isn’t that his job??
Thank you officer.
Oh that young man is a hero, God his cry for help for his mom broke me
❤❤❤
What's the outcome? Did she make it ⁉️ Thank you to all that Responded
Thank God for the man that didn't hesitate to help.. 🙏🏾 Praying for the Mom..🙏🏾
That cop was ready to let that lady die then to go in that water but knew he wouldv gotten in trouble for not trying.. how do people not get the sense of urgency when things like this happen.. i wouldv ran n jumped in that water quick
Ih ni so what are you going to do about it it.  Great job.  Speak up  Use your words
My baby boy saved my life when he was 4 years old blessings to this family
3 people came together to save one life, and race, creed or ethnicity didn't matter.   You all are brave
Thank God she is ok!!!! God is Awesome!!! ❤️🙏🏽❤️
Thank-you lord Jesus Thank-you lord Jesus
Please pray for her.  May she be alright and safe. What a horrible thing
Cop gets like an F
The  fear in that baby's voice brought me too tears amazing office
The kid just said his mom was in the car .. and the cop still shouts and asks if there’s someone in that car!! 🙄 the kid had to repeat again yes she in there… 🙄
Thank you jesus she is safe
😢😢devastating! That baby was hyperventilating trying to save his momma🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Hi
Thank You, Father God for sparing her life.Bless her son and the officer. 🙏🏽❤️✝️🕊️
Get that boy counseling right away. He will forever be traumatized
Always break the back window. Vehicles are made to sink forward and the back be left to float upwards towards air.
Oh dear God his pain 😢 bless you and may this memory only be one of joy that YOU saved your mothers life 🙏❤
Thank goodness for this little boy… 😢
Is somebody in there? Is the door unlocked... stupid questions to ask seconds are ticking away Yes, his mom was driving the car, so obviously (kid even said it when he said hurry help), and im sure the kid double-checked to make sure the doors were unlocked before they crashed!!!
Poor baby. Everyone moving slow, I pray she's OK.
Sending prayers and blessings to this mother, that she comes out of this ordeal healthy and strong. She needs to be around to continue to raise that AMAZING young boy! So brave, so selfless. All he cared about was his Mom. The two men (officer and Samaritan) were there by the grace of God that day. Thank you both for rescuing this woman.
The officer didn’t want to go in the water. That boy just told you his mom in there
The cop nos she’s in there the kid told him he’s acting like he don’t wanna go in the water and help the lady 🤬why are you a cop ?
Why does this has to say dramatic rescue really? This young man upset because he need help for his mother.😢
Hijito hermoso salvaste a tu Madre ❤
Fantastic young boy!!!  ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Well done on all their parts. God bless them all. ❤
That boys worry for his mother broke my heart
How fuckin traumatizing for that boy
Did she get saved?
That cop made me mad.. the boy just told him A. It's his mom B. She's having a seizure  C. She's in there help her!!.. why did he ask is there somebody in there????
Lord please let her come out of this ok please God bless her and her kids oh no no no
He became a man that day
This cop is an angel.Thank you to save he life*THIS IS JUST ABOUT LOVE *
Why the hell is the cop walking and asking if she was in there. The girl told she was.  And what the the f. Is the door locked.  Lucky there was someone already in the water trying to help.
Fund the police!
Oh no omg those poor kids and that woman oh my God please please let her be ok please
Oh lord. Thank you for him being there
🙏🏽
Oh no that poor child 😢
Cop was slow.
One helluva officer!
Come in from somebody with epilepsy, having seizures are scary. Seizures are more scary for the people that are watching and seeing it happen😢. This little boy was such a brave child I am so happy he was with his mom that day. And I pray she's all right.  They say we shouldn't drive if we have seizures. 90% of my seizures have been during my sleeping time. So I just go ahead and drive because they only really happened during my sleep.
This precious child knew exactly what to do!  God bless all of them!
I'm crying 😢 I know he had to be so scared to not only watch his mom go into a seizure but to end up in a pond. Thank god for every hero involved!!❤
An officer that didn’t see a color, but a family in need of emergency assistance. One of the best videos I’ve seen involving policemen. I thank you myself!
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼👍🏼 bravo à cet enfant 😮❤🤗 merci également à cet agent❤😮😊🙏🏼👍🏼🍀
Take your medication and get re-evaluated.
Why did cop waste time asking the child if his mom was in the car?? he already told her she was in the car she had a seizure. She’s in the car hellooooooo!
I'm grateful she received assistance in time to save her life. However, disappointed at the officers initial nonchalance and lack of urgency when he reached the vehicle. I truly feel that if the boy was blonde the officer would have been moving through the water and to the car so much more haste.
The officer of the century.
😢 This brought me back to my childhood when my brother drowned in our pool. I was so panicked out I did know what to do. It was the most helpless feeling ever especially as a child. He was rescued but CPR wasn’t working. He was gone. Then I just started praying. A miracle happened & he came back back to life hours later 🙏
Man this broke my heart 😢 watching this i lost my mom 2 years ago i’m happy they was able to get to her prayers.
That poor child . He saw his whole life changing in a bad way right in front of him
☝🏿🙏🏾 Thank God for this child and the officer!!!
Thank you heroes. ❤. God bless you and your family 🙏🙏🙏.
They cut the camera so fast. I pray she’s okay as well. Lord, bless her baby boy.
Thank you for being a righteous police officer .
That poor child . He saw his whole life changing in a bad way right in front of him
God bless everyone 🙏🏾
God Bless the Boy, and Our Cop who risked his life to save her. 😢
The cop really didn’t wanna do it.
Bless his heart how desperate he was and God put a angel at the right place at the right time. God bless you sir. What a HERO you are. I hoept he city acknowledges you as a hero.
❤❤❤❤
Bless you 🙏🏻 🙌❤
He going slow for a drowning human being.
Thanks to the rescuers. Good cops are out there. Young man your an Angel for saving your mother. 🙏
Yes yes to seeing that there are good humans! It’s beautiful
🙏🏿
This was lil bro from shameless 😭
REMEMBER THIS VIDEO WHEN YOU HEAR ALL WHITE COPS HATE BLACK PEOPLE!!  Dont let the few bad cops turn your opinion negative on the 90% of good ones
Dang. When that camera went under my anxiety Ross. Didn't expect that 😳
Sounds like there where 2 kids the boy talking to the cops and her daughter near the car saying help my mom please when the cop says is somebody in there or is that the boy????
Cop took forever.
Oh that poor baby! That broke my heart, and then the guy actually asked ”is somebody in there”? Are you effing kidding me? Well, at least he got her out! 🤍🤍
Thanks to the officer 🙏🙏🙏
😭
THIS IS WILD !  Why did the cop ask was there someone in there?, after the child just told him wdf happened, glad they was able to get her out though! Kudos to that brave baby boy! 😇
OMG 😢😢😢😢😢
If somebody in there? Really!? The child just told him! He don’t care poor child.
🙏🙏🙏
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
🙏🙏🙏
The cop gets me tight yelling is someone in there like didnt thr kid just tell u?
Poor baby broke my heart ❤️. I hope her mom is doing well
To God Be The Glory and Thank God for the kids bravery in seeking help for his mom and the officer who rescued her 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿❤
Nah the cop don’t care he don’t even run to help he walks! is like if I can help good if not oh well. 😡
Lord have mercy .
❤❤❤❤
Love
Ny- ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏
That officer slow af he said his mom is underwater dumny
That little boy had to literally scream at that cop more than once helped her once they got to the scene because that cop was just yelling as anybody in there knowing full well that little boy just told him she's having a seizure and she's underwater what do they expect you to do to be like yeah officer I'm over here having a seizure under the water could you please come open my door
🤲🙏♥️👮🥳
I do not understand why that cop would get to the car after that little boy tells him what he tells him and stand there yelling at the car is anybody in there several times that cops actions make me think that he's literally not intelligent he doesn't know what he's doing why would you get there and not instantly try to help but stand there and yell at the woman in the water who clearly couldn't hear you
He did not seem like it was too urgent. I hope she made it. Boy, what luck for that kid though, that cop must have been driving by. Or maybe her head was above water, and he called 911? So many questions
Awesome ❤
What a crappy channel
Mother and Child connection is love. Simply love.
Dear Lord i hope she's okay
Thank you Lord for saving her life!
❤❤
Is somebody in there. Is wild, good video
I pray his mother makes a full recovery 💕💕👏🏽👏🏽. This precious child needs to heal from this traumatic event. He did such an amazing job getting help during such a scary event.
Is she ok??? Tell me these babies didn't just loose their mama
✨🙏✨
This just made me cry …thank you Jesus … thank you Officer!
Omg that poor kid. Thank god she was saved. Hero Son.❤❤❤
Man, I hope she made it. Somebody let me kno😢
Why is the cop asling stupid questions.. the kid literally told you she was in there. How would anyone know if tbe car was unlocked? That baby is frantic just help wth
Glad they saved her🙏🙏🙏
Sometimes seizures begin for different reasons and then later life she may not have been epileptic throughout her life sometimes it can just happen....... Trust me I know..... When my son found out about himself he gave up his license as well but he was in his thirties when it happens to an accident
That poor child it hurts to see him so desperate to save his mom he is a hero he got help
Honestly she should not be allowed to drive with that medical condition as you never know when you can have a seizure.Very unsafe.And scary.
God bless you for saving his mother.
Thank you so very much for helping that child  save his mom!
I love to see girls get the best of boys who think they can't play 😂😂😂
🥹🥹 Precious boy😢
First responders don't make enough no matter what they make.  They do it to help people.
She shouldn't be driving! Way too Dangerous !
She’s in the water Him: is somebody in there
Man sees a half submerged car and ask if anybody is in there. That lil kid literally told him that she sunk in the water. Smfh
Thank God for this boy and the cops. Hope they’re well
Poor sweet bubby.🙏
OMG!
That's why I love Texas..ppl are always ready to help another ❤
I’m crying
Im glad her life was saved, but if diagnosed with this type of condition its not safe to be driving, for herself family or other people. I really hope she gave up driving after this. To be honest it should be mandatory at this point. Great job to the police man and Samaritan that helped and little boy.
How bout adding son saves mom on the caption too? His begging broke me
I’m not sure you should be driving if you have a seizure disorder. This is terrifying. Move to a city with good public transportation. Or a town that is walkable.
Poor baby😢
🙏🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 💝 Thank you Lord, the brave young man desperately trying to save his precious mother, and thank you sir. 💞💞💞
Thank you officers.
Me alegro que estén bien 🙏❤️ que susto ese grito del niño pidiendo ayuda me hizo llorar 😢 gracias a los que ayudaron saludos desde Chile ❤
Those 2 gentlemen did what real men do in panicky situations. They maintained their composure, didnt panick and mom is alive. Love it
Thank god for the child to alert the police to help his mom. Super proud
Oh this sweet child!! God bless him For getting help but my heart breaks that he had to go through that at all! I hope his mama is ok ❤
Heros !! The lil boy the stranger the officer  🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Is the mother ok??! I pray that she is!! Her son is her Angel!!!💖💖💖🙏🙏🙏
❤
Of course somebody's in there he just told you
My God
God bless both of them , Bless the rescuers for helping
Thank You Jesus Thank You Jesus bless this child and his mom
I’m Almost In Tears Watching This Her Little Son Is A Trooper He Loves His Mama You Can hear It in His Voice🤦🏽‍♀️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾👁️👁️🙆🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
💪God is good all the time.
This young man is a hero as well. Thank you, officer, for your quick response.
This breaks my heart! I pray they’re okay
The kid said initially his mom had a seizure and was sinking, why did he waste another almost 10 seconds asking dumb questions like "is someone in there? Is the car unlocked" fucking jump in and find out bro
Thank you Lord God 🙏🙏 for blessing your child and to get help to save his mother 🙏🙏🙏 thank you Lord God 🙏🙏
Take your anti seizure medicine people, it will change your life, sometimes your physician may have to change or alter the dose, but it’s worth it
What ended up happening???
That boy saved her life but she could of gotten them both killed. She should not be driving. If she’s going to be having seizures. No one that has seizures should be driving
Poor little guy. Hope all ok much 🙏 love all make me think my kids. I hope theu never have be put in this position.
The fact that he stood there to ask if there was anyone in the car like she was gonna say yes it’s me come and get me. It’s ridiculous. I’m so glad the boy kept shouting. Yes, my mom my mom help her help her.
🙏🏾🙌🏾🫡
Can someone explain, why did he have to put the kid in back of the patrol car?? 🤔🤔
😢
Wow ❤ poor baby I’m so glad he was able to get help that. Man stepped in so fast truly a Blessing
Praise God for those that rescued her ❤
Omg. Lord had mercy
Kid-Help her! Cop-hello, ma’am?  Can you hear me under water? The woman- gurgle gurgle
I know what it's like to have seizures. I thank God I never had one while driving. When you have one you don't know what is happening, everything is black. It's like you're asleep but not dreaming and you wake up all off a sudden or you come out of it slowly but you have fuzzy memories, you aren't exactly sure of what happened but once you're all the way out of it you realize that you must have had a seizure and it's kind of hard to put the pieces back together.
"Is she in there?".... WTF!! Shut the hell up and go look DA!!
Dios del cielo ese hombre dios lo envio justo en el momento pobre niño q desespero sin poder haser nada dios es tan grande como ese hombre hiso lo impensable lo dificil y lo logro...hay ese niño me desespera
Praise our God's goodness in saving their mother!  Great job boys in getting mom help!  Hero's one and all!  What a scary situation; thanks be to God's angels!
Dose any one  know  the outcome
God bless you abundantly and all you desire be fulfilled
Poor baby 😢….Thank god for him…I hope everyone turned out ok.
Those poor babies. Imagine the terror. Seeing someone hve a seized alone is terrifying. For it to result in a crash and ON TOP OF THAT driving into WATER. Good lord. I hope she’s well and safe.
That cops reaction time was slow af!!
That guy did end up helping but c'mon... Where's the urgency?! I would've ran and jumped in not ask if there's anybody in there after the kid repeatedly said his mom was in there!
😮😢😢❤
OMG 😱🙏🙏🙏
Oh my goodness 😢😢🤴🏽🙏🏽✌🏽
Awesome save, guys 🎉🎉🎉🎉
My dad had to give up driving because of his seizures too. And that man drove right after he could walk I think
Some of the comments on here is disgusting and awful for no reason talking about the boy did nothing to get his mom out how he’s a coward and he needs her cause his dad not around .. this little boy would not have been able to carry his mom who had a seizure out of the car it took two full grown mean to do so .. the police was taking his time while reacting to the boy panic like he was unsure if someone was in there even saying is someone in there once he arrived ..I hope she is ok and her son is no longer traumatized
Thank you, officer. I hope she is ok.
To me the officer seemed pretty slow and nonchalant with less than a sense of urgency, but who knows
AWESOME ❤
Damm he act like he scared
That cop was slow
He said his mom is having a seizure. She’s in the car. Why do you ask somebody in there every second matters
Cop: is somebody in there Drowning mom: blurppppll bldkdkdk
God bless this family ❤
But did she actually survive? She didn’t look conscious to me
May he be given all the resources that our country can offer, so he can become whatever he wants to be in life, to be successful , secure and happy.
Wow 😮 her baby  boy saved her life what he thought  he was lying or something 😮😢😮
THAT BABY JUST SAVED HIS OWN AND HIS MOMMA LIFE!!! MY HEART IS OVERJOYED❤
Slowest rescue  I've seen.
No sense of urgency or passion from the cop 🤮 it was the dude already in the water that saved her
Put the damn camera down!
Good work.God will take care of you all blessings ❤❤❤❤❤
Only god knows why that women delivered a king cause one day he was gonna be the very thing to give you life back ❤ wow his cry and plead gave me chills 😢 many blessings guys ❤
Civilian Protection is what we called it in "Half Life video game." This guy needs a promotion.
Praying
😢😢
ugh
This touched me Deeply! This poor child, the fear he must of felt.
It’s a blessing he was with her that day!
How did he get out, the kid??
God Bless Everyone that helped ❤❤🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
To God be the glory thank you lord it us still good ppl.
Thanks to everyone that saved that lady. Need more kind helping people in the world
Amen 🙏🏿 Amen 🙏🏿
Everyday heroes right there.
All I can say is THANK YOU FATHER GOD!  My heart seems to be beating a little faster even though I knew that it was a favorable outcome! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Dang! This kid saved his momma!
He is kinda slow to an apparently e.r😂
Thank God for these rescuers!!❤
IS SHE IN THERE? IS SOMEBODY IN THERE? My man, the child JUST TOLD you she’s in there, just get to saving her. Damn.
Thank God for giving this child the strength I hope and pray this woman lived ❤️🙏🏻 so scary I’m an epileptic and not allowed to drive God bless her
Thank you allah.
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving them and thanks to the people that helped may God bless them all Amen 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
❤❤
I wonder if she supports defunding the police now?
Women park in some wierd places.
If this is her first time having a seizure and she survives her license will be taken. If this not her first time her doctor that treated her didn’t do his job by revoking her license   My mom was sensitive to many smells that would send her into seizures her license was taken same day. ER doctor reported to DMV to revoke
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
God blessed them all.
why was the cop moving so slow in the beginning
He was screaming his mom was in the car! Listening skills was taught in school when I was younger. Thank God the officers went in to get her.
🙏💖😢💪🏽
Not only had he saved himself, he knew to get help right away! A survivor and a hero!
God bless them
❤❤❤❤❤❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭omgoodness! I pray everything turned out for the good
This is some intense body cam footage!
Any update on the mom
What is a not listening to that kid telling him that his mom is in that car in the water pay attention man
That poor baby 😢
Oh my goodness that is so scary. I hope this mother gives up her license because that is just tragedy waiting to happen. Next time it can be a head-on collision with something 😢 that poor kid, it's scary to see your mom having a seizure, then to realize you're about to wreck and into some water at that, then Mom isn't waking up and the car is sinking, geez that poor kid and I'm so glad that those men were around to help ❤
This is exactly why they should have stricter laws against allowing people with a seizure condition to get a driver's license. They're not only putting their own lives in danger, but they are putting their children's lives in danger or whoever they have as passengers as well as strangers on the road. It's as bad and as selfish as deciding to drink and drive as it is to decide to drive knowing you could have a seizure at any time. Of course I thank God her child is safe and it looks like she got saved, but she shouldn't have been driving in the first place. She's clearly had frequent seizures because her young son knew exactly what it was that happened and why she wrecked, so why would she even put her baby in such a deadly situation that's child neglect and child endangerment.  What a horrible mother
Is someone in there......wow
Yog mu yuav suav ma yuav tsum ua ntaus ntawv sib yuav ntaus ntawv ntawm suav teb ma yu thiaj ntseeg tau tia suav yuav mu hlub tiag 5yg mu tua povtseg no nawb mg. Qhia ua kev kawm o mg.
Does anyone know if she is still alive? This is so sad!!!
Frigging amazing! Heaven guard them all and keep them safe
She's having a siesure. Hold let me get my phone. Let's see here , uh camera,  record okay let's go.
Bro had no rush in helping her This guy didn’t want to get wet 😂
Not the cop taking his time
May God Bless you young man  and I hope your mmom is ok!❤
Hallelujah and Amen
❤🙏
Aw man.... little dude's desperate voice. Absolutely brutal
Sooooo WHAT HAPPENED
Thank the Lord Jesus for the police help them!!🙏🙌
Hero❤❤❤❤❤
Shout out to the boy he just saved, that woman he did not see color he seen a woman dying
This clip sucks, we don't  know the outcome. Why do this?
Was that a baby kid they were carrying out weres the mom
Wow! He got out of the car and then found help what a incredible young man!
Wow! He got out of the car and then found help what a incredible young man!
Articulate young man there, even in such fires circumstances.  Strong ❤
Was he also inside? How did he know?
The facts she had a seizure on the road breaks my heart in Jesus name I pray
❤❤❤
She’s having a seizure and he’s saying “ is somebody in there ”smh he sound have just rushed in
👏 👏 👏
As a nurse we were told patients couldn't drive if they had seizure disorder😮
❤❤❤
This is a miracle 🙏
❤❤❤❤
Thank you Lord....hope shes😢doing OK. Son good on you to get help for mama. God bless the officer🙏🙏🙏
this is difficult to watch
God is real He  sends an angel just in time God bless you.🙏
Amen
Ya Allah, the anguish in that poor baby's cry, bless that man's heart. I hope she's alright.
🙏🏽
That baby heart❤❤❤❤
"she's having a seizure..." adds to the danger of this situation.  Boy was terrified for her but kept his head.  Thanks to his effort and help from officers, she was rescued.  I notice how calm the officer's voice was throughout.  Blessings to all. 🌹❤️🇺🇸
Since when is a cop saving a drowning women a Good Samaritan? He's just a dude doing his job people.
Wow hopefully she was ok
I’m sorry, but I just have to call a spade a spade! If that was a white little boy that ran up to him with a white woman in a car he would not have been asking all of those questions before he went into action. They don’t value our lives at all, and this is just another exhibition of that. And you can miss me with all your funky replies as a result of my message!!!
That poor boy...
Thank God he was coming alone and thank God she ok❤❤
Love the way he yelled for EMS to "step it up!!" He knew time mattered for that mama!! I hope Mom & son are ok!!
God Bless Them
Happy she was resued. God is good. Thankyou for the man who saved her
I pray she is ok 🙏🙏🙏
That poor child
He’s a brave young man
Hero4REAL
If this truly affected U> find your local YWCA or womens centers 2 donate/volunteer. 😢 So many become homeless if they're in an area without transportation 2 get 2 job/school/grocery store. Kids get dumped into broken system or on the streets.
Prayers for the rescuer's and Blessings to all.
Thanking The Most High For her Baby Boy Being safe and Very Grateful For the Men who got his Mother out of That water Alleluia We Need LoVe!!! 🕊🫂🤍🙌🏽🙏🏽⚔️❤️🩸😇
AMEN ETC THANK U GOD JESUS AMEN,SON HER HERO 🙏
He's a Hero to Me the Officer is as well for believing him.❤💙💙🙏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I hope she and the child was all or is all ok.❤❤❤❤
God bless her and her family Amen 🙏 ❤❤❤
Kid in extreme emergency, no phone, mom drowning.. the odds of that cop being within running distance of the kid.. and managing to resuscitate the mom, that’s miracle type sh
❤❤❤❤❤
How fucking terrifying.
I cry for that little guy.
Am proud of this young man but can somebody thank the actual rescuer too, duh!!!?
"Is somebody in their?". What u think sir?? She was driving! But Thankyou for helping her
We’re just going to ignore the lackadaisical nonchalant behavior and rhetorical questions of the “cop”…? THANK GOODNESS a Good Samaritan was there the cop was doing nothing!
No deberia estar manejando en esa condicion
Y'all ever watched shameless he looks the kid
❤❤❤❤
GOD come through all the time.  Bless the recuser who got her out in time
The little boy just told the cop his mom was in the car and he continued to screaming is anyone in there how about just hurry up and get to her
God Bless the Police Officers for not quitting. God bless that young man too.❤❤❤
SANTO
Thanks to God, and the MTs they saved her. My God 🙏
How heartbreaking to hear the fear in this child voice.  I hope they all end up well and mom gets help with her seizures ❤
Cops asking too many quick.  Maybe he's afraid of the water or can't swim. GOD bless this family.  Lord, please heal this little boy of this trauma
Prayers for him and his momma and those who helped!
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
❤ god is great! I thought all cops are racists?😢
"mom!! mom im back" 😭 she ok???
Oh man, this killed me to see this poor boy so desperate to save his mama... I hope they're both ok♡
Thanks God she is saved
What a brave young man ❤
I hate how they ask so many questions like just get to helping and shut up
The cop saying" is there someone in there" like tht person gonna really say something back 😶😒
I hope that kid gets counseling. What a traumatic event for him. Kudos to him staying so brave and seeking help. I hope his mom recovers fast. (Another comment claims she lived)
Omg😮😮😮😢
My friend long ago in Oregon could not drive due to Seizures.  Most States one can not unless they are seizure free for x amount of time.  Far to risky for self and other drivers.
His lack of urgency though. "Is she in there? Is somebody in there!" Hello? that kid was just saying she was.
Instead of him jumping in😢
Cop didn’t do much
Good thing he wasn’t raised to fear cops!
Thank You Goid Coo !! Nice Rescue From The Heart ! Not Once Did You Hesitate ! Her Son Will Always Be Greatful To You !! I Know I Am.
What a stupid ass question
His cries 😢 poor kid
This mannn brought me to real tears 😢 im so proud of her son for having a strong mind and the Will to help his mom and to the cop that made the rescue 😩🥺💯
🙏🙏🙏💯
Bless this little boys heart. So brave trying to save his momma. 😢
He said "i aint getting wet if i aint have tuh"
I dunno… I watch these videos and then read these comments…I swear we’re ALL the same❤❤❤God Bless.
God bless her & her sweet baby!!🥺😢🙏🏼💖💖💖
I don’t get it?! The child said “she’s having a seizure, she’s sunk, please help her” and your response is “is she in there, is anyone in there”? Time wasted because you already have the answers
That baby was terrified but still had the wherewithall the get help for his mama. Breaks my heart that he had to experience that but it speaks VOLUMES on who he is. Great work young man ❤❤❤
You are so brave little man, I pray for you and your mom and pray for recovery
Thank God for the help from officer.❤😊
That poor little baby trying to help save his dying mother 😢
The boy is the hero! ❤
My heart went out to that kid, bless him
Is the car unlocked? WHAT?????
The kid is soak and obviously was underwater as well. 😢How terrifying!!!
😮
Bless him for not giving up. ❤
God blessed him
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Some doctors say that after a year of no seizure activity, you can drive again. I don't trust it.
OMG  THANK GOD THAT YOUNG MAN, SAVED HIS MOTHER. SO VERY SCARED, BUT GOD CALMED HIM ENOUGH TO TALK SO THE OFFICER COULD UNDERSTAND HIM, THOSE PRECIOUS SECONDS  PROBABLY SAVED HER LIFE. GOD IS GREAT . DEAR LORD, GOD, I PRAY THAT YOU SPARED THIS YOUNG MOTHER, SO SHE COULD CONTINUE RAISING THAT AMAZINGLY COURAGEOUS YOUNG MAN OF HERS. MAYBE ONE DAY, HE'LL BECOME A FIREMAN, OR A PARAMEDIC, POSSIBLY SOME TYPE OF LIFE SAVING PROFESSION. GOD BLESS THIS WOMAN, THIS YOUNG BOY, THIS POLICE/SHERIFF, & PLEASE LORD, BLESS ALL OF THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL. WE LOVE YOU LORD, WE LOVE YOU JESUS CHRIST, WE LOVE YOU HOLY SPIRIT. AMEN
Dude was taking forever
That little boy is so precious.  I’m glad to hear that his mom is OK. I can’t even imagine what he must’ve gone through. Sending lots of love.
I dont see anyone being saved. What did they do at the end? I felt like the guy said "i need a root beer" and threw something. And the cop asked "is the car unlocked? All slow and serious. REALLY?! 1. You cant open doors under water even if they were unlocked. 2. You should be swiming to save the person obviously drowning in that car immediatly... The water was way to the back bumper. They probably are out of breath already bc the kid had to run a ways down the road to find help in the first place. 3. Last but not least, to this kid who was so brave, you did your best and you should be proud of yourself. I hope you and whoever else was in that car are okay. Just know, either way, this wasnt your fault and you are a beautiful brave boy and a true hero. My prayers go out to you all.
I hope this little man's mom will be ok. ❤
Babyboys desperate cry for help breaks my heart 💔 he’s so beautiful
The police officer did not seem to be in a rush to assist.
Little man saved his moms life that day 100%
Thank you in Jesus Christ name. Thank you
Send n prayers
That child saved her life along witht he help of the officer and good Samaritan. If the boy didnt tell the cop she wouldnt have made it. Great job all 3 of them.❤
Ужасная трагедия и сильнейшая травма ребёнку. Желаю суметь это пережить духовно .  Мне сразу вспомнилось видео где собралась  вся семья  зимой ночью , на водное крещение в России , и мама  решила прыгать в ледяную прорубь . При этом она прыгнула под лёд , и её страховая верёвка оторвалась 😢На глазах у своего ребёнка её унесло сильным водным течением под лёд .. Ребёнок так страшно кричал .. Это был душераздерающий крик , это было так страшно... Досихрор не могу забыть. В итоге женщину нашли через несколько суток погибшей... При вскрытии было доказано что эта женщина ещо боролась и царапала ногтями лёд ,потому что когда её нашли то у неё были сломаны до крови ногти. Очень страшно когда родители гибнут на глпзах у детей. Берегите себя и своих близких.❤
Omg I hope she's ok prayers
Cop : is sOmBoDy iN tHeRe Kid: yes my mom Cop: iS sOmBoDy In ThErE Kid:🫠 dude my mom is about to die
Wow! What a brave son! Thank God for courage!
Is she okay 🤔🤔
Prayers up
Is the car unlocked??!?! wtf, yea, that’s what that scared little boy is thinking of/remembering if it is or not as the cop strolls on down to help. . .
Why the fuq did the cop ask over and over in somebody in there when the lil boy fuckin told him his mom is in there??!! Smh
Thank u too that wonderful officer! Many blessings overtake ur life! Ur kindness will never be forgotten! That’s what life is about helping one another regardless of of color or disabilities ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Heart breaking...that sweet baby was so brave.  Thank you to the angels that helped them...i pray she is okay.
Almost like he didn’t believe the child, sad- I would’ve reacted with total urgency… but no one thinks about that know a days, it’s all for themselves
Thank you, Jesus🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿👏🏿
Was the car stolen?
Smh.. No type of urgency.. even doe the kids said sum one was in the car.. dude walks slow to the car & ask if anybody was in the car after being told clearly that his mom was in the car.. but still ... Slow & hesitant...good thing someone else came.. but...This is America
Thank TMH he had everyone in place! Sending up prayers!
Poor Baby, he broke my heart!  I pray his Mother made it!!  Thank God for those people that stopped to help thst boy!  What a horrible thing to have happened
What a brave little boy in such a scary situation❤️
Blessed
This guy is a real hero I love these types of videos ❤
The cop should be fired. Every second counts, he didn’t even want to go in the water. He knew she was in there, why did he have to ask. Why did a stranger have to do the cops job?!?! Get him fired! Why if that was your mom or child ?
Oh God
Why is he asking is somebody in there. The child took you there for a reason. The person was having a seizure 😑 Smh he was ready to let that lady die. Thank god he had a change of heart. 💯
Thank You JESUS for us9ng this young person to save the person who was stuck in the car under the water.. 🙏🏾 👍✌🏽👌🏿
🙏
Thank TMH for this officer! Protect and Serve!
This dumb mf talking abt is somebody in there
One of the most terrifying sounds. Bless this young man. And his mama.
What a brave young man! I hope him and his mother are stronger then ever
Praise God🙏❤️
Thank God for everyone who helped rescued and hopefully saved her life. God bless the son and everyone 🙏🏾💫✨
So grateful they were able to save his mom! Did anybody see this story on the news? A white cop saving a black woman… hmmm
That cop seemed to take his time
He needed to step it up, talm bout... Is somebody in there😢 😊😊 bless the little man
I hope he still has his family after this very scary life altering event.  He tried so honourably to be the MAN. He will do Great Works in his life. 🤝🏅
guy is like, "I don't know kid; are you sure someone is in there?  Well, let me go ahead and get ready to do something.... just need to stretch first... okay, you are sure she is in there?".
Lord Help!!!😭😭😭🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙌🏾
Thank you honey! You are your mommas angel!
I didn’t think you were allowed to drive if you have a seizure disorder?
New cars are coffins on wheels when they hit the water. They have safety guarded so much you can’t open doors, break windows….its killing people. The same devices that save you on land are an obstacle in the water.
Police don't get any credit for what they do daily.
Thank you so much officer for helping the little boy his mom
Thank you for Pile 3 ❤
They got there in time though right? shorts don't normally show the end or do we have like a whole video that we can link please?
My lord 😢
Oh my heavens, does this get to me. 😢 please, Lord, I hope the mom survived. What a brave boy. Brave man .
God Bless you all 🙏 ❤️
I feel for the boy. I hope his Mom recovered. 😢
God Bless these angels who saved her!
Bless this gentleman for stopping as well as this sweet little boy for waving someone down to help his dear mama❤❤
The terror in that boys eyes 😢… I pray she lived.
😢 poor kid, 😭 i'm glad  everyone is ok🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️ awesome cop & bystanders, ❤
Omg the cop is moving slow
That poor kid!!!!!😢
That's a brave young boy, but the cop sure took his time saying anybody in there after the boy said his mother in there...I hope his mother is OK
Having a seizure underwater and ur expecting a response?
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️
Mama pls don't drive anymore. That child is traumatized but thankfully he was able to get help. I pray she made it.
I believe he say that his mother is having a seizure I hear this little boy tell the police man that for sure and her foot is stuck
PTL for a son that didn’t hold back with his desperation. Beautiful!!!!! To God be the glory!!!!
I hope he did save her.  I can't tell if she was moving.  Oh my gosh that poor boy!  Bless his heart!❤
Omg
Nobody talking about the cop's lackadaisical chill "no emergency here" approach and demeaner?  "is there anybody in there?" Kid just told you their was! Time was clearly not on her side and the cops like, let this slice of chocolate cake digest and ill have a gander. Unreal
This possibly happening or hurting innocent people while driving then having a seizure is exactly why my brother chose to never drive again. He sold his both vehicles and motorcycle. He bought himslef a nice bicycle and was hit by a car at 60 mph in a crosswalk because the person driving was texting 😢.  Glad this woman was saved ,she shouldn't drive at all.
Update?  Bless his heart 😢
God bless him his mom and the plp trying to save her in your name Jesus as a truck driver I'm very watchful lady in Atlanta was having a heart attack in my early years I pulled over called 911 sad how fast we goo on d highways and aren't alert of others😢
Is this real?! One of the most intense moments I’ve ever seen….
Triggered my anxiety the way he was so nonchalant
Poor baby! This is heart wrenching, his desperation and pleas for help just made me cry for him and I pray that in the name of Jesus Christ she is well 😢
Thanks God
The one filming should be ashamed, not helping, but filming what a shame
I’m sorry this police officer was moving too slow.
That’s heartbreaking 😢
O Lord! That poor child is forever traumatized.  He is his mama's angel.  He saves her.
God is great!!
My young daughter and I saw a man having a seizure who drove off the road and slammed into a tree. When we got to the car to help, he was unconscious, and we found his seizure helmet in the back seat. He's lucky he didn't die or kill someone.
I'm so glad he saved her, but him calling out" is somebody in there " is just so crazy to me...
Do any car makers equip cars with a window breaker? 🤔
When Women say they don’t need a man 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😢😢😢😢
Such an amazing young man good job buddy...
Prayers for him and his, mom that broke my heart
Sweetheart how he is telling to save her . His heart was bumping fast and short in breath
The urgency on this cop is amazing. Smh Effer probably weighs like +300 lbs
Punk ass cop asking if anyone is in there what a duck wasting time in a critical situation
Thanks be to God they got her! That poor little boy crying was heartbreaking.
Yall why are we allowing  folks that has seizures drive. WHY... IV GOT A FAMILY MEMBER THAT HAS SIZURES AND THE DOCS GONNA GIVE HIM DLS. WHY
Thank you, Jesus praise your holy name for his wonderful people and his beautiful child
This child is a hero bless his heart I hope that his mom is ok.
Thank you officer 💜 you made a difference that day
Oh my gosh GOD bless you🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽Lord thank you
FYI if you're able to remove the back of your headrest the two metal poles are actually can help break the glass
That why we need not good but great people in the world
¿ Rescataron a la mamá?
Why did the officer take so long to jump into the water?
Praise God for that brave boy and those heroic men
The chills i got while watching this is insane
That cop didn't want to get his feet wet for a desperate little legro boy! Is anybody in there? Didn't that little boy just say his momma having a seizure, she can't answer you!
Good job buddy you saved her life!!! It takes a strong brave heart to leave to find help.
This is tearing me apart thank you so much for God that there was some amazing people that were there to help this young man and his mother🙏🏾❤️🥲
Yess,God Thank U Lord The young man was able get help 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ brave young guy to think in that way an it had him in stable mine to get out one road an get help.
Oh my Lord..I hope she made it❤
I lost a friend and her fiance like this. She was only 36 😢
The cop didn’t sound to eager to help
God bless this little hero 🙏🏼!
This cop was WAY too slow 😩
❤❤❤❤
The F up with the cop! Is somebody in there. Get your ass in the water and FN help, Great Job Little Man...
So brave God bless you son❤❤❤
I'm surprised the kid knew what a seizure was. This may not be the first time he's seen one.
Thank God for son, and police officer or person who saved her
And thank you to the man that was already in the water
Thank u Jesus for the gentleman with a good heart
God bless her son! So scary for him...he's her hero!🥰
🙏🏽🙏🏽
He's an on time God Yes He is But God But God But God on time God
The child getting out and fighting saved and helped save mom, too. Good kiddi.
Precious son, God Bless you🙏❤️
Could he go any s l o w e r. My anxiety.  The kid literally tells him that his mother is having a seizure and he's taking his time getting to her.    Like what the heck.   And these comments are unbelievable.  Im glad everyone thinks so highly of this guy but he should have some PEP IN HIS STEP.    This guy should've went faster.
Kid: “My mom’s in there she having a seizure!” Deputy: “Is somebody in there?” 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Just a day in the life of a cop
This got to me😢
Good thing no gators are in there
This is so positive from all the disappointment ive seen on media from police officers thank you Jesus
These are the videos of officers that people don't share.  Remember officers save live too
And the libtards want to defund the police...
Prayers are with the family!
I hope the mother is ok,God is Great
My hurt sunk hearing this angel of a boy panic like this!! 💕💕
Back the blue. This guy cared about that kid's momma
Gob bless this kid and lady
Wow, talk about a difficult rescue. It's a little unnerving how quickly cars will fill with water when even partially submerged.  There's clearly no way for her to survive if he waits for fire/EMS!
Thank you Mr Policeman for your help keeping calm for thus young man who also is a HERO ALONG WITH YOU❤
females smh ..
Florida? Florida.
Poor kid. Hope she’s ok damn
Was she alive?!
Blessings to the person that saved her!!!
God bless❤
God bless them all!!!
Quick thinking of both the child, and the officers.  Glad all survived.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
God Bless You ❤🙏
Thank God he was able to get out and get help 😮.
Is somebody in there?  Really?  As if he’d hear the answer from a 3/4 submerged car ?  These precious moments can cost a life.
Praying momma survived. Her son is a blessing
Why in the fuck did he wait so fucking long ?
That poor boy and the police didn’t run straight over but wasted time asking is she in there?  The boy clearly said she’s having a seizure which caused the crash most likely and that means YES she’s in there!
Bless them
Oh 😢 that precious boy broke my heart
Where does it say she was saved? Does anyone know for sure?
Pretty casual response
This brought me tears😢
Cop definitely did not want to go in the water
Lord Jesus  I hope all is ok . This young man I feel for hi. So brave  for his mama 😢
I'm in tears!! Thank God they saved his momma!!!💔💔
Hero police 🚓🚨 - great 👍💯😃😸helper child 🙏🙏❤❤🎉🎉, thank you much police 🚓🚨 officer and GOD BLESS YOU 😇😇🙏❤❤& YOUR FAMILY 💖🙏🎉
Cops always waiting
This cop is lazy or afraid. I’m choosing lazy by how slow he moves in to help her in the car. There is obviously someone in there he just doesn’t want to get wet
The cop was moving and acting like there was a cell phone in the car that the kid left in there
Praise the Lord and those Heros!!! So scary that things like this happen!!
Thank god this didn’t happen in alligator/ snake infested Florida.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Props to the officer who said "Hop In" instead of wasting time asking questions
Did she make it? Lord, have mercy.😢
Heart rending! Please say she survived...
This video is so heartbreaking seeing that young child beg for help for his seizing mother. I hope she is ok and doing well. Thank you to everyone who came to her rescue
This cop is a hero for saving this boy's mother.  I feel for this young man that panic in his voice
Well, he had to stand and yell at it first, but yeah, he did his job, i guess.
I dont know why everyone is saying the cop helped save the mom because he didnt he kept asking if someone is in there after the poor boy was crying out like how is that helping pulse he just kept pulling the same door the full video. The one who is the hero is the poor boy who is scared and the man who got her out not the cop he was just there.
Omg! My worst nightmare!
I don't know how many times the kid had to say his mom is in the car before he believed him. Thank goodness she survived though.
Did I just hear the cop say" is anyone in there" After the kid just said help her
GLORRRRRY TO GOD 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Great cop...
Oh Lord Jesus i pray she made it!!
How many times does this distraught child have to tell this cop his mother is actively dying before he shows any sense of urgency?
I am so glad this gentleman was there to help this child and momma!  This child was so desperate to get help but also scared for his mom.  Can you imagine the torment he must have felt having to leave her in that water to go get help?  Not all heroes wear capes!🙏💙
Thank you, kind sir. May God our Father bless you mightily!
God bless this family and wishing you guys the best ..
Is it me or the cop was way to clam and slow in a situation where someone could be drowning inside a car but his whole energy changed when there was a good Samaritan trying to help.
Sorry but I think the cops moved as fast as  pine sap. The top of the car was above water when he arrived. He went around and around again and it was under water for who knows how long. The desperation of her child 🥺🥺🥺
See all cops are not demons  This cop could have past on by ❤❤
The cop was an idiot. He said if somebody in there the little boy clearly said my mom is drowning she’s in the car and then he screams someone in there. He said yes my mama she’s in there. He says the door unlocked and the car through the water every second count when it comes to someone drowning.
"Is she in there? Is somebody in there?" Wow. He might as well just stand there and start throwing rocks at the car to see if here if hear any movement. Haha. Jeeze
"Is somebody in there?" what a noob!
I praise God for her life being spared, and may God have a blessing to the officer who saved our life
Is somebody in there? Did I hear that? 👂🏼 bruh what’s the point of that kid calling him for?
They are so fortunate good looking out son
😢 Thank you Jesus Christ for this brave young man and this outstanding Police officer.
Thank you to those who rescued and cared for this mom. ❤🙏🏼🙏🏼
He said over n over his mom is in the car help her why was the cop still asking if anyone was in there? So odd the things they do and how they react in intense situations 😮
Omg, I'm in shock watching this. I pray that her family comes together and offer to drive her from now on. No child should have to go through this. Im shaken up just by seeing this. I can't imagine being there in person. God please protect this family from any more harm. ❤❤
If she was white he would of helped her
I hope his mom is OK. Bless his heart. He saved his mother‘s life. That young little man is a hero.
Praying 🙏 🙏 🤲 🤲
People who have seizures, shouldn’t drive.
God bless you 🙏🏾😮
Thank you Angela!
I hope him and his mom are okay 💕
Is she in there? Well what do you think.
Poor baby❤
😢😢😢
They didn't seem to be moving all that fast to rescue her.
🙏🏼
He took forever wtf
The trauma, this poor baby has to endure for the rest of his life😢
Brave young boy. Praying 🙏 that his Momma is recovering and he is okay.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
❤Thank you Jesus for her son and the cops for rescuing his mom. I pray she has a speedy recovery.
That mf walked. Didn't even run tho
GOD'S LOVE❤GRACE🕊AND MERCY🤲 😢🙏🙏🙏🙏✝️☝️✝️🙏🙏🙏🙏💔
My biggest fear thank goodness she was saved
Thank you so much officer, God bless those who help us and curse those who hurt us, may God bless you and your family in the name of Yashua I pray, thank you Yahweh, that it’s still some good hearted people on the police department, that actually help us
OMG, those poor kids 😞 they saved her life!! Well done kiddo's!!
Thank God she is ok
Does anyone know if mommy is okay 🙏
He broke my heart. His desperate cries for him mom to be saved. .
I swear, atupdi officer. How the hell is a drowning person having a seizure going to say  " yes im in here ! " ? The boy is clearly telling you she is in the car and drowning having a seizure!!!!
Thank you Jesus for whoever you are May blessings flow over you and your family
God bless to all.
Why would the officer ask if someone in there wen the lil boy done told him that she was in there
Praying for lil baby's mental wellbeing after that. He kept it together so well♥️
God Bless his little heart and thank God his Mother’s life was saved. He is definitely a hero!
Come on! Greatest 2 words ever spoken in English
Thank you Heavenly father, for all who helped this family,  all who showed love, and compassion, and care understand ing.  Thank you for the angel  you had available at the right moment through the police officer. , whoy else. Bless each of them .and thank you forgiving the mother the right help she needs. In Jesus name.
Good on the cop but half of America hates cops so...? I hope this kid remembers a cop saved his mom's life and will respect the blue instead of hating those who just want to help save people. The kid is very brave, good on his sweet soul.
Omg😢
Kudos to the cops, but the real hero is the sun! My goodness! One can only pray that our children would be this way if we were in danger
Poor kid..
Sweet boy... this is so scary.
Thank you Lord every body Ok. Thank to the officer and God bless you 🙏🙏🙏
This lady had a seizure prior to this. Those window punch devises need to be kept in cars as well if you live near water ponds lakes deltas rivers,  oceans those tools are hammer like devises. You can purchase at auto parts stores. Keep in glove compartment
Good Samaritan my ass. Its his paid job.
as a paramedic I see pt ALL THE DANG TIME, That have a history of seizures amd are still driving...im like wtf! I get if you haven't had a seizures in like a year or two and your meds are working but I've seen pt that were driving and we just picked them up a month ago for a dang seizure! there needs to be a nation wide data base that the hospitals can download to temporarily suspended their license till they are cleared from the seizures...
Bless that little kid..and thank you officer for saving his momma xxx😊🫡😳💙🖤
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Lazy cop, yes she’s in there!!! Meow you get in there!!!
The title of this video is ridiculous. "Good Samaritan cop"... it's literally his job to serve and protect
That’s miracle that we’re able to save her life. That’s real HERO’s starting with her son❤
How did he got out
He really doesn't want to go in the water but his cam was turned on... Idk
God bless them amen 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
That's what a little boy said go help her you sitting there talking to him talking about somebody in there if they're underwater how the hell are they going to say yeah Smh Hello Duh!! He had one of those razor kinda thg that breaks windows but couldn't  break it  🙄🙏 I hope the person made it...Poor kids gonna be traumatized for awhile Sad
A woman I just met was helping me paint a room. She had a epileptic seizure and I tried to ease her distress. Afterwards I suggested she go home and rest. She told me had to hurry and get to an appointment. Asked about the appointment. She was applying to be a city bus driver. I said you can't do that she said well I need the money!
That cop had 0 urgency in the beginning slow ass
Stands outside of water…”somebody in there?” Sir if you don’t get your ass in that damn water and help the lil boy mama. He told you she was in the car!
This broke my heart😢 poor baby.
Texas has great MEN!
Why the bad word would he stand there and ask “is anybody in there? As baby boy is crying and pleading for him to save her life, put the pipe down!!!
Sooooo it didn't show how he saved her or if she is ok?
How was the kid doing more than the officer?
Brave police officer and young boy ❤❤
Awe the fear in that little man is heart breaking. If momma was conscious, she must’ve been terrified. God bless the rescuers 💕
Lord, my anxiety! YES, SOMEBODY IS IN THERE!
My God poor boy
I was having seizures for a while a few years ago and I didn’t drive for a year after my last one. I noticed the lights on the cars were sending me into an aura state and I’d have to pull over. I finally got my medicine figured out and thankfully I’ve been seizure free for 2 years now
Calmly says “Is somebody in there?” DUDE get in there
Seizure citizens should not be behind the wheel
Sending prayers
Brave boy
So you mean to tell me, the police don't have that tool to break windows???😢😢 I think they should have that on their person as well
God noooooo that floppy arm!! I hope to god she is ok!
Hearing his scared voice is heartbreaking. He saved his mom by looking for help. I hope that they are both doing better 💕
It was a desperation in his voice that just broke me down thank God for little boy and the good Samaritan
I hope she will be ok
The car is under water and the cop stands there and yells is somebody in there ? Like hello !!!!!!! We're you not just told that the front of the car is underwater yelling like your gonna get an answer from her wow step it up is right !
This is why people with seizures are not permitted to drive. It is too dangerous 😢. I hope she survived 😩.
Thank our CREATOR for the way this turned out. Bless the boy, the boy's mother, and the officers🙏🏿
This gives me chills. That boy was brave!!! He knew he had to do something❤❤❤❤❤
I’m really surprised the officers don’t have a tool to immediately break the window of a car
THIS IS HORRIFYING! Oh my god that poor baby and his mama 😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞 im so grateful for everyone who helped !
May God Allah bless you my son. A mother's son.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Maken me sick!!!😢😢😢  Thank you!!!!!!😮😮😮❤❤
Oh my Jesus! Did they get her out in time??
Thank you so much Lord for this precious child and blessings him with more time with his mother .Thank you to those that helped may God bless you and keep you and your family s safe
Anyone else confounded at the laid back- no rush actions of the cop??? WTF dude
He told him his mom was in there having a seizure. I'm glad she's ok.I hope👀😩 Yep, she's still in there😬🥺🤐😤 Help her😢
Poor kid, it's so painful to hear his lil voice crying for help.🥺
Right...keep defunding police til yo ass is in a crack!
God bless the two officers and god bless the boy an his mom
This cop is super slow as if he do not want to be bothered
🙏🙏
🙏🏾 for this brave little boy and 🙏🏾 to his mom!
“Is there anyone in there”, wtf DO YOU THINK? obviously.
I read the other day how many times blk ppl have been left in burning bldg and in dying situation by emergency assistance broke my heart.... I hope this was not one of the times .
Omg, chills..... 😢😢
I PRAY SHE WAS SAVED… that young man is already going to be so traumatized!!! 😢
Did she live?
These  police are earning respect . Good job officers.
Hope that they are all safe and well. That brave boy is a hero. God  bless him and all that were their to that that family, 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank God she was rescued, 🙏🏾 God save this woman
This broke my heart. My mom had epilepsy & died from getting in a car crash bc she had a seizure. I pray for the safety of this woman and her children 😢❤️.
"is sumboya in Eyre"  "YES,  MY MON IS IN THERE". ..."IS THERE ANYBODY IN THERE"?  TES, YES, YES,  SHES IN THERE!   Ummm son ..I got to ask you,  do you know if anyone is in there?   He took his good ol time while there were precious seconds to smash the window before hydrolock sealed the doors and made the windows UNBEAKEABLE.   ....then he gets a move on it...when it's too late.   I'm sure she didn't make it
What a brave young man! May God bless you and your mom
the cop was slow
Awesome Officer God bless him for doing his job!!
Cop was so slow
Did she make it? Where is the rest of the story?
I am so happy they are OK. She shouldn’t be driving knowing she has seizures.😮
Insurance gonna have a stroke on this one
😢
This  poor baby
Damn, that cop moved WAY TOO SLOW. He was like, are you sure I gotta get wet? Embarrassing.
we thank God for the good Samaritan.
Why the officer ask somebody in there? The kid said it is and don't look like he is lying he looks frantic. The officer didn't look to me like he wanted to get wet or help was taking his time. The officer a hero? The e kid was the hero if was me I would be where let's do this he doesn't want to get wet leaving the one in the water others already taking care the others and other children in the street
Was not impressed with the response of the officer. Kudos to the other person and the son.
Brave lil Boy 🙏🏾
Omg I thank God that he was able to find someone it just so happened to be a police officer God is so good
Cop acted like he ain't wanna go help
God bless this poor child and his momma. ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Shout out to that young man! He is a hero! Saved himself and his mama!
Brave kid hero❤❤❤
Thank the Lord for that brave child ❤
That brave child just said she’s having a seizure help her and he’s yelling….Is somebody in there? 😢 I pray that she’s OK.
PLEASE 🙏 GOD SAVE HER!! AND RESTORE HER BACK TO HEALTH! 🙌🙌🙌 IN JESUS MIGHTY NAME!!! AMEN 🙏🙏🙏
He was asking if the car is locked
Seatbelt dangerous
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Oh bless his heart. This made me cry. God bless this woman and her son.❤❤❤
Why was he moving so slow, bro? I would’ve been diving in. What the hell
Sending Blessings 💙🙏
The kid told you she was in there. Dumb freaking cop. Bless the kid. Jesus!🙏🏽
That cop slow af duuhh hurry up shit 🤦🏾‍♀️ he told you twice
Difference between a cop and a citizen trying to help citizen jumps in the water immediately let us protect ourselves
💔🫂🙏🏻🫶🏻🥺
Is she okay?😢😢😢
Cops are not always respected but is expected to jump right in and help. ❤
😢
Wr need to give Kudos to our good LEOs.  The bad ones have made the Nation Ungrateful and Unappreciative.   Not right.
THANK YOU BROTHER 🙏🥹
You men are amazing right place and right time young man you are a strong person to get help for your mom in that terrible situation you all went through my prayers you and your mom are okay
I pray his mama is ok now 🙏 God bless this family,cops, and EMS and the little boy ❤🙏🙌
Brave young man thank God she’s okay
😢brave kid...broke my heart..thanks to that officer
God Bless❤
That kid is a hero that brought other heros and I'm hoping they were able to save his mama.😢❤
He keep telling you help me it's obvious someone is in there. Good job lil man.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Can you ask more questions…before you actually help.  🙄
GOD BLESS
That broke my heart.
I hope she has a speedy recovery God bless them all.   But I hate when the police try to tell us in EMS to step it up they know we have to drive with due regard by law if we don’t we’re in deep trouble we’re coming as fast and safely as we can trust that. If we get into an accident then they’ll have to roll another Ambulance unit and that takes extra unnecessary time. People already don’t pull over even when hearing our lights and sirens another thing that irks my nerves so we have to drive carefully.
God, please this family.  Bless this young person finds peace after witnessing this situation 🙏
Oh my god 🥺 I hope she's ok
Thank God for the officer. Who helped save the young mother.❤
This cop needs to be watched he seems a to have no care for colored folks . Just saying
Oh my sweet baby😢
Is this cop, officer Doofy?! Didn't even grab the windows breaker upon pulling up. Then he yells, "is anyone in there" after the kid begged him to get off his a. Then just walks nonchalantly. Cops not very smart from what I saw. Cops love asking people the same questions 10 times. Is it training or intelligence?
Lord have mercy I know that child was too scared
don’t antagonize her! 🤣
Thank you for helping him Mr.  God bless you!
Omg! Is she ok?? That poor kid...I hope his mom is fine.
She needs her license taken away. She’s a danger to herself and others
The cop was acting like this was a crime scene at first
The officer was talking too much and a little to hesitate in the beginning for me.  That boy cries for urgency. Pray all is well
I'm just going to go ahead and say it, the officer moved WAY too slow to access that vehicle....dafuq...worried about your shoes homie?
cop acting stupid with those questions.
The boy had to damn near beg the officer to get in and help. He asking is someone in there no shit why would the boy me in the water by himself trying to save his mom. The damn cop looking from the road .
Thank you all❤
Is she ok?
That is the real face of the desperation seeing the dying loved one in an accident.   This will make him traumatized for the rest of his life. I hope Mom  was saved after all.
Thank God  it was shallow 🙏 🙏and son was able to get help in time 😇
The freaking KID rescued his mom. The cop doesn’t look like he was in a hurry nor did he put much effort into it from what I saw here.
Lord they saved her but she’s in critical condition 🙏🏽
No rush now…🙄
❤❤❤❤
Little man is a hero here…. Might have been a little excited considering the circumstances however he had it together enough to get his message across.
I wish they would follow-up and let us know how the man and the little boy are doing
The cop taking his precious time.  He didn't care for real
That cop took his time and if it was for the Good Samaritan helping first he would’ve just stood there. “Is somebody in there?” He said no one but a car sinking the lake
The cop reacted to slow for me. If you see a child in distress and the child is telling you his mother is in a sinking car in the lake. The cop should have immediately call for resur first second enter the watrr and break the window. The cop call out but you have tobrealize the person in the car may not be able to respond so act faster. The video show slow motion butI think he did the right thing but he seem to have so slow. I did not see a rush or running towards the car.
Why is the officer show to respond?
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I’m sorry that boy had to go thru that frfr
What do you mean is someone in there listen to the kid!
Sorry, but the cop yelling “is somebody in there” to a car that is almost completely underwater, and a child telling you that someone is in the car, definitely pissed me off for a minute. Come on sir! Glad he helped though.
Man this broke my heart. I hope and pray that his momma is okay. Along with him. 🙏🏾❤🙏🏾
See folks, we need.our police!! Thank God for his service
Ahh bless his heart got me crying here the fear in his lil face He saved his momma Momma you are raising a good young man you should be so proud of him ! Love & blessing to your family
Thanks God for Jesus. My brother suffered from seizures.
Slowly taking a video…
Bless that boy's heart.❤️ And to think, there's ppl who want to defend the police. There are good ones.
🙏🏽
Is anyone in there??? The kid just told u his mama was in there! Hurry!!!
God bless those wonderful cops. We need the good ones more than ever.
Thank you GOD,
“Is somebody in there?” … umm wtf the kid just desperately explained to you the situation
Does anyone know if she is ok? What a brave and wonderful son? 🙏
I’m just a little frustrated with the cops reaction and questions Like cmon! Move!
Lord let her be alright, bless her child.
Doesnt look like ahe made it 😢
GOD BLESS HER AN THE RESCUERS
That cop God bless him. He knew that baby was scared to death and he told him to hop in. All  He heard from that baby was she had a seizure and sunk.    Please those of you that have been diagnosed with seizure disorder give up your license  even if you are taking medicine to help manage it. .
This video edited out some parts and details. She actually had two kids in the car when she crashed. A 16-year-old daughter who remained by the side of the car in the water until police arrived and a 12-year-old son who had gone to flag down the police. Plus two workers helped pulled the mother out, not the cop.   “Jonquetta Winbush’s two children, a 12-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl, managed to get out while Winbush was having a seizure in late July, West Orange, Texas, Assistant Police Chief Jessie Romero said Wednesday. Winbush then passed out and put her foot on the gas pedal, plunging her vehicle into the pond.  Body camera footage from veteran patrolman Charles Cobb, who was nearby monitoring traffic, shows Winbush’s son frantically approaching the officer.  “She’s having a seizure. She’s sunk,” the boy told Cobb. “She’s in the water. Help her.”  Cobb put the boy in the back of his patrol car and raced to Winbush’s vehicle, which was almost completely underwater. Two workers from a local plant had already gotten in the water to get Winbush out, Romero said.  After dragging Winbush from the pond, Romero said Cobb administered chest compressions.  “She was totally unconscious,” Romero said. “He was able to get a pulse back while he had her there on the ground and revive her until EMS got there.”  Winbush’s sister, Bevnisha Holman, said she personally thanked one of the workers, Epifanio Munguia, for helping save her sister’s life.  “I messaged him and (said) I want to personally thank you for being there for my niece and nephew and ultimately my sister, because he really helped save her life,” Holman told Beaumont television station KBMT.  After three weeks in intensive care, Romero said Winbush is now breathing on her own.  “She’s still in the hospital, but she’s going to make a full recovery,” he said.”
Seriously he’s telling you his mom is in the car and he’s asking if there’s someone in there who asked that question when the kids in distress mom is having a seizure in the car at sinking in water and you’re active there someone in there🤔😑
He was in the road clearly telling that .com his mom was in the water ? When we get there the cop is said g the kid who is in the water trying with everything he"a got to save his mom, but the cop is asking ,,? Is somebody in there is she in there ? Wasting time?
My heart breaks for that poor, scared lil boy. I hope they're both doing ok. 🥰🥰🥰
Thank you for helping.  👏👏
Well done to the man that helped my hat is of to you sir great job
To the rescuer, thank you ❤
The tell EMS step it up was personal 💪🏿
Yes, please don't drive if you have seizures, it's an easy way to die or kill someone. May God be with that precious family.
The lack of urgency from the police officer is mildly infuriating
Cop Is Slow To React...Hope Everyones Is Okay 🙏
That cop didnt do 💩🙄
That poor baby, i hope his mama is ok now.
Thank God she's ok. God bless that man and her precious son for saving her life. His desperation was heart wenching😫.
Luz y amor para el pequeño y la mamá  ❤❤❤❤
Brave boy😢
I have epilepsi so i dont drive for this reason... Its actually illegal in my state the even obtain a license
Thank god fir help
It bothers me a bit that he stood on the side of the Pond saying is there anyone in there?! Even though the kid said, she had a seizure, she went into the water and she sunk, she's IN the Water!!! I thought he was a very clear on that. Just saying every second counts, when someone is unconscious, and in the water..
The emotions that little boy felt knowing his mom may be gone. I hope she made it.
Great job by both ❤❤
That cop showed 0 urgency
The cop was moving real slow
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why American people always we the obvious but they still ask “are you Ok” when the person is unconscious or broken and bleeding or like this one “ is somebody in there”. But the car is submerged in the water!!! 😒
Sweet young man saved his Momma. Brave cops. ❤
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💕💕💕♥️♥️♥️
Is it a shame that some politicians want to defund the police!! What could happen if this oficial  didn't existed?
The boy says She's having a seizure and underwater and the cop casually walks towards the car.
so sad.... this will be stuck with you forever.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So glad to hear that they were able to save her!☺️🩷
Brave little man
Oh my gosh🥺😢 I just want to hold him.. poor thing. I pray his mom was ok.
Great job little man. You should be so proud of yourself. That was so scary, but you were so brave and you saved your momma. What a hero ❤
You sound like a damn fool to say that child didn't care anything about his mother something is really wrong with you 😡
Prayers for all!! That baby is traumatized, I know he's never leaving his moms side!! Kudos to the good Samaritan and cop out 1 in the same 🙏🏽
Is she in there? Is anyone in there is the questions this cop asked after the young man told him she was in there and having a seizure. I didn’t see any urgency from this cop non what’s so ever. I don’t know if the mom made it out but GOD bless the young man because he’s the true hero.
That boy is a hero through his fear and everything else. The only thing that baby was worried about was trying to save his mom thank you to anyone that stopped and help them and I hope and pray that everybody’s healthy and OK and that family is doing great, and that little boy deserves a lot of acclamation because it took so much for him to stand up and do that through his own fear, and most adults can’t even do this so respect to this young man!❤ I think the whole world could wish to have a son like this one day. 🫶
They are both heroes.
No driving for seizure patients. Period. It’s for their and others safety
I cried. Damn. God Bless that young man and his mother!! May they be protected and led by The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
How old is Mama be okay
I feel like the cop barely did anything
❤❤❤
The police act like he didn't even want to go and helped a little boy he knew exactly what that little boy said 😔😔😔😔🙏🌎✝️🛐.
What happened to running and diving into the water to save a damsel in distress? He was strolling asking dumb ass questions.
This broke my heart
Again why would a loving god make hisom have a seizure and not stop it? Because there are no gods, anyone praising a BRONZE AGE deity for saving her are afraid to think. WE ARE of this planet. A loving creator wouldnt make us suffer or depend on water and food
You can hear the urgency on that kids voice
Poor baby, had to be so scared watching his mom have a seizure! Then crashing and drowning.
Update, please!
WELL NOW... If these two CAPABLE Heros had been on Chappaquiddick Island 55 Years ago, Mary Jo Kopechne would now be 83 y/o!!!!!
It's good to see a human being in uniform. God bless you, Sir.❤
涙ながらに子供はママを助けて❗❗😢と訴えているのに…!撮影してる場合じゃない  瞬間を捉え視聴率を上げたいかも知れませんが人の命がかかっているので…本当のに貴方が善人で救いたい気持ちかあるのであれば撮影より救助にあたるべき 片手にカメラなんか持っていたら時間も掛かり救助出来ませんし一刻をあらそうので 🍀
Good Samaritan, hell, the cop did his job. That’s what he’s supposed to do. He’s a public servant. “To protect & serve.” This is stated on the side of all marked police cars. This is also the oath that the police officers swear. This is what any normal human with a heart would do. This is how we should all treat each other, regardless of our trespasses or trespasses against us. The sooner everyone can understand this and start working together and helping one another the sooner things will start to get better in this country.
Angels on earth, God bless you 💖
May YAH bless this family
God bless this boy n cop everyone that helped n his ma ma
No she's just taking a bath
I pray she's ok.
I'm glad she was saved but she should be banned from driving
Praise God! She made it, child and police 🚔 saved the mother!! Thank you, for your service 😌
Truly amazing the police didn't grab the mom and start screaming stop resisting I fear for my safety
God bless and I hope it turned out okay God help them that's so heartbreaking
F* that cop with no immediacy yelling from dry land "is anyone in there" while that child is yelling to help her!  WTF!!
Thank Jesus that cop stayed calm and saved them . He was almost too calm for a minute.  I didnt think it was gonna end well 😢❤
I’m surprised he didn’t try to arrest the little child first
He not moving fast enough for me. And it sad
Update please
Praise God! Brave son❤
That poor child. God bless them. I hope the mother is well.
“Is somebody in there” yeah cause they can yell while drowning 😂
Jesus Christ!  ➕
Omg i pray his mother was OK god please pray over this lil boy and him mom for healing prayers in the name of God 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😢😢that young boy was desperate to save his mom 😢
I knew the cop was White right away. He couldn't have taken longer to get to her. The kid told him 3 times his mom was in there. Cop gets there on shore sends the kid in first to make sure mom still in there. Then he gently walks into water, knowing he has to break the glass, YET HE DOESN'T BRING GLASSBREAKER W HIM ? THEN HAS TO GET PUT WATER GO GET GLASSBREAKER SITTING ON HIS FRINT SEAT. IF THIS POOR WOMAN HAS ANY ISSUES FROM BEING UNDER WATER, ITS THIS COPS FAULT. HE DIDN'T RESCUE HER, HE TRIED TO DROWN HER ... I'D LOVE TONTALK TO HIM ALONE
The officer took his sweet azz time helping!!😢
Poor boy is terrified 😢
God bless you all ❤
❤🇺🇸💪
Cops do have a dangerous job even without using there guns
He was exhausted running to get help
I pray to God she is doing better! 🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾❤️
Is mom ok??
God bless this family and the cop who save them
Awesome kid. Thanks Samaritan
This poor child tramatized he was clear she sunk shes had avseizure why did he continue to ask the poor child if there was someone in there? Why? The little boy was out of breath poor kid my heart goes out to kid's who have no way to lrotect themselves orbany adult its such a helpless feeling as a child to have no eay to make things right ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ to the little boy i hope he and his mom will be ok this is so sad
He is truly his mother guardian angel  !!!!
Is this lady has seizures she should not be driving
Sooo a soak and wet child ask a cop for help, and the police get to the emergency, and ask before getting in the water “is anybody in there”? 😮 sooo you can’t put 2and2 together 😢
Praying she is okay 🙏🏽
Bless this boy and his mother🙏🙏🙏.. And bless the officer ❤
Thank you Lord for this lil boy and cop. This was on the news she did make it. Thank you Lord
I pray Mom is doing well. My husband had a stroke at the wheel and went into on coming traffic. Praise God no one was killed. My husband is recovering from his stroke. That is why I wish they would give people high fine or jail time when folks just don't get out of the way of EMS or the fire truck. Because someone is fighting for their life.
What a wonderful  cop,,, and good Samaritan,,, save that ladys life,,, that poor little dude,
Praise God 🙏🏾
The wasnt going to
I don’t know how old this video is but anyway I’ll sending up blessings and prayers for him, her and their family. This brought me to tears honey!
Besides him not really being in a hurry knowing someones could be underwater is only negative i get from video.
The Cop keep asking is someone in the Car… WTF!!! 🤦🏽‍♂️
That poor baby
THERE ARE GOOD POLICE NOT OF THEM ARE RACIST
🏆💯🏆💯🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
That God for a quick response.  I hope everyone is well.
Hope they saved her. Poor kiddo experiencing this trauma. Hope they are all Fine!
Poor little boy. Thank his he came across the right people.
Could this asshole cop move any slower.
The way cop seemed very relax and slow at trying to rescue the lady is mindboggling. The kid came and got him because she was in water, then he proceeds to walk up asking again like she could answer. This cop is a f-ing idiot.
Now thats a Good Cop !
The cop's thinking was as slow as his accent.
Defund the police!!!
Kid rescued mom cop didn't rescue nobody as he's taking his sweet time and he says for EMS to step it up
The woman in the video is Jonquetta Winbush. According to the article I read on Good Morning America, she survived after spending 3 weeks on a ventilator. Her 12 year old son Dwight is who we see in the video. Him and his 16 year old sister got out then sought help to save their mom.
I know it is possibly not the way I am perceiving it, but I get so frustrated when I don’t see people hurry to help!!!!
❤🙏this  Yung  man  will be just fine  ,he's  going to watch  the  world  with  God  on his  side ❤🙏
This cop is lazy
Instead of running he goes, "is somebody in there" really????
It’s unclear if the mother is alive.
🙏
Thank you Jesus! Not every human is as kind
😇🙇‍♂️🙏🙌❤🙌
Thank GOD Bless u officer.its ok now baby. ❤
God bless that police officer and all who helped
He needs to have a sense of URGENCY
Thank God. There's still some peps in the world
Albeit the police officer helped, pissed me off he was f****** walking so slow like get the f*** in there the kids just told you she was in there
Terrifying for this poor child. So grateful to the rescuers
I hope his Mom is alright. He was so brave and saved his life with his quick thinking and action 💜
Yes sir.  That's what up . Great person never care who they're helping .they feel good when they helping people. Great guy no hesitating. That's what is all about ❤❤❤
😮😢💔😵👶🙏👮🌟👌😎👏👏🪽
Omg please help us all in Jesus name thank you LORD!!!
Is somebody in there? Yea dummy he told you!!!  Like hurry up tf!?🤬 Poor baby, hope both are well❤️‍🩹
Brave boy.
“Is she in there?, is the car unlocked?” Are you Fuckin kidding dude? Jump in and find out
Prayers for the child and the officer and their families
That officer severely lacks the understanding of how urgent that situation was. Wtf. I hope he got scolded for it
To God be Glorified for these helpers and his majesty Act of delivering from definitely Harms way. MY GOD IS A KEEPER
Baby boy saved his mom's life. God bless him and the police officer.
THANK GOD FOR THE CHILD, AND THE QUICK RESPONSE BY THE POLICE OFFICER! GOD BLESS THEM ALL!❤❤❤
That baby 🙏🏼 hope the mama makes a full recovery so she can hug her boy
Did she live!!??😢
Thank The Lord he was with her, wherever they were going. Hope she is ok.
Thanks you officer 🙏
“She’s having a seizure she in there “  Cop:”is somebody in there?” What a fucking idiot
Thank you for helping that young man, getting his mama out of the cart to safety. You're a true Hero.
Did his momma live
Poor child 😢🙏❤️
That cop was absolutely useless, moves entirely way too slow asking stupid questions. How many time did he try to open that locked door with the handle.
Brave boy.
Dumb question
😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤
That is heart breaking to him/her , the anguish and panic in their voice. 😢. I sooo incredibly happy this was a reunion for them. May they heal from the trauma. ♥️♥️
Come on man...why u ask if she's in there after the kid mentioned it......the heck
,they can't drive
"Is there someone in there"  Said the Cop after being told multiple times the childs mother is trapped inside the car that's submerged in water.  Obviously someone's in there genius..
That poor child.  The absolute terror hes experiencing.  God love him.
Black America you better QUIT attacking these cops before they stop helping you ungrateful butts
Knowledge is power and to know that she's having a seizure is amazing ❤❤❤ Hes such a hero ❤❤❤
Heroe ❤
Is somebody in there??? He said his mom. Every second counts.
God, bless all of them.
prayers. thank u JESUS❤
Great job on the officer's part - keeping his composure during a stressful situation. If I had been in that situation, I would have been panicking and unable to focus on the task at hand.👏
Great job young man💜💜💜💜
Is the car unlocked 😂
I hope mom will abide by the rules of not driving as an epileptic as she almost k!lled herself and her baby 🤦🏾‍♀️. People have to stop tryna learn things the hard way. Traumatizing everyone involved smh
This is a nice example of what "Serv & Protect" looks like. Hats off to all 1st responders (👨‍🚒  👮  🚑) that gives themselves to aid others.
Did She survive???
Great child
Thank you God... for having people in the right place at the right time,. AMEN 🙏❤
Cops don't get paid enough,👏
not to be a dick but that cop didnt seem very motivated to help at first despite the clear expressions from the kid
The cop was getting on my nerves at first. Asking is anybody in there after the boy done already told him his mama in the car before they got there. I pray they are well.
He is a super man who risks himself to save another life. May God always bless him and keep him in all his work career that he has because they are respectable people.🙏🙏🙏🙏❣❤❣❤❤❤👍👍👏👏
Who cutting onions 😢
As an old Paramedic and now RN, that boy just broke my heart. You could see the desperation and anguish
I guess she lived? I feel like the cop was overly calm about it, imho.
Oh baby!! My heart hurts and the tears won’t stop. Please tell me his momma is ok!!! Please someone update me!!!!😢😢
God bless the cops for the swift response. Pray child and mother are reunited and mom recovered well.
So what happened?
Yelling is someone in there almost upset me due to the child already said she was having a seizure.
oh sweet baby!  He's in my prayers. I hope and pray they were able to save his mom.
Gracias a los seres que ayudaron❤❤❤ como pasó esto?
Hope they are ok.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.
She survived!! There's an article. Search West Orange, Tx car accident.
That poor little boy, I just want to hug him and tell him everything will be ok, 😢
All cops are racist and do no good though i thought😂  Cops save people dailey and they get crapped on by alot of tye public. Such a shame.
What a stupid question 🙄   yes! She's in there.  She's stuck...he told you!!! Get her out now!
he said she's having a seizure...the person goes is she in there the kids is telling them she's in there ...what is it they don't understand...
😢
OMG 🙏🙏
Omg hope she’s ok my heart melted ❤
Poor baby!! Hero!!❤️😭💯
Nahhĥ bruh.....the question is why is she in there ?
Poor Child. The Police Department as usual can be commended. Going into a murky pond, to rescue her. Unbelievable
🙏🏽
Kudos to the police officer who risked his life to save his mother.❤
Glory  be uno God.. if this video reached this young man you're a hero. To that police officer, sir thank you
God bless them all❤
His slow speed is deiving me a wall
That must have been horrifying for this kid. Go help this family.
Brave man . Oh but the poor boy, so scared. 😢😢😢
And those were happy tears
That young man was God said and he's truly a hero as well as the people to help the person to get out of the car😢😢😢
Is she ok
❤❤🙏🏻🙏🏻
Hope they rescued her in time. Gods bless those boys.
My mother was an epileptic around that same age. I had to watch her go through all these spells. My heart goes out to that young man I pray for him and his mom it’s a horrible thing to go through and especially for a child to see his mom go through I pray that all is well.
Mad respect
Oh, that just brought tears to my eyes, I’m glad they were able to save her
Thank you sir for you kind heart to help
He just said she’s in there. 🧢
How is she ❤️
Oh my god.. Poor kid. My parents divorced when I was 3, so I spent 2 weeks at each of their houses every month for my entire childhood. For no real reason, I had a massive fear that if I wasn’t with my mom she would die. My mom lived in Oregon and my dad in Washington and I just remember having extreme panic attacks as young as 8 when my mom would drop me off at my dad’s. I had a reoccurring dream that the bridge between WA and OR would collapse as she drove back across and she would be screaming for me to help her. This would’ve been my worst nightmare come to life as a child. I feel so sad for this kid, but I’m incredibly grateful his mom is still alive.
That baby got outta that water and saved his mother’s life. What he did was so brave because most kids would be in .  That officer also did a brave thing saving her life
Thanks. God bless you all for rescuing her from drowning
Why drive when you know you have such a health condition?
Please tell me they saved mom! Not the moment for a cliff hanger.  That poor boy!
Poor baby. I'm  glad he got help.  Hope his mother is well.  Brave little boy.  God Bless Them.
Bless that baby
Dear God mercy on him and his family.
Padre amado que dolor el de su hijo pidiendo ayuda.
Is there somebody in there? Pffff. Dude the kids just told you his mum is having a seizure, she is stuck and she is in the water.
Cop was not quick to help at all barely seemed concerned at 1st. I know they need to stay calm but damn.
I am so happy GOD sent excellent rescuer's and thank GOD got the  young man to ready to try everything to get the mama out. GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU TO GAVE ALL YOU STRENGH . THANK YOU🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😮wow!!
Oh praise God, young man, you're a hero!! And thank you sir!!
That cop took his sweet time getting in the water. Am I crazy? Made my blood boil.
❤❤❤❤thank help 🙏❤❤
How heart-wrenching  Please God have saved this mom for this little boy 🙏
Part of me think that this police officer didn't act with urgency
Good, what not Samaritan, a hero officer doing his duty, which he believes in a great man and brave child that saved the day 👏
Is somebody in there? 🤦🏾‍♂️
The cop didn't seem to be too concerned. Mean while the boy was panicking knowing she needed help quickly. I mean really he's standing there asking if someone is in the car nonchalantly when the boy already told him there was. Minutes count. The car didn't drive itself there.
God bless this poor child. ❤ thank you kind sir we need more people like u in our world.
That poor baby.
What’s pissing me off and I don’t understand is this little kid is in dire need you know he’s not faking because he’s all wet. He’s so scared and this man is not Russian to get to this car. This cop is not running the little boy jumps back in the water and runs to the car to try to help his mom and the cop is so nonchalantin the situation like why was he not being quicker?
He’s soaking wet so he either jumped in to save her or jumped out the car to run and get help either way this boy is fast and a quick thinker! I pray his Momma is okay!
She's having a seizure, cars upside down and underwater  Cop: is somebody in there? 🥴
THANK YOU LORD FOR SALVATION AND MERCY... AMEN AMEN HALLELUJAH 😢💕🫂🌹🙏🏾
Poor little boy, will never get over this😢
Reason #1 For Becoming A Police Officer
What a brave little child! I hope all ended well. 🙏
she was having a seizure
Is she in there? Is car unlocked? Hey how much gas did she have in the tank? Why aren't you in school? Did she drive in the water on purpose? How old is she? Does she got any id on her?
God always make away 💯🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Bless him. But that is his job. Thank you officer.
7whriei
Awe that poor son! broke my heart! I pray his mother is OK 🙏 ❤
At the very beginning I heard that young boy say she was having a seizure.  I'm not sure he would know what a seizure looks like unless this has happened before.  I wonder if it's safe for her to drive?
What a brave little man. I hope his momma is fine.
I don't know this man ,I say to u sir thank the gods an goddess  choose u sir ur more than a hero
THANK GOD FOR THAT PRECIOUS CHILD..
Thanku sir 🙏
Thank you so much you a life saver.
Good boy. Brave and quick thinking . I'd be proud if you were my son
Was it a rescue? That child broke my heart. 😢 I felt every bit of his plea.
poor kid ...
All Praises to FATHER GOD, LORD JESUS, and FATHER GODS  HOLY SPIRIT.🙏🏾😇🙌🏾
This guy moved way to damn slow the kid did more work saving his mother then this grown man ugh
Omg wow 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😔
Poor baby
Mama’s little angel,he broke my heart screaming for his mom 😢
Could the cop have moved ANY slower?
Lord they were moving slow at first... God bless them all.
Just take your time! Fyi? People under water cannot answer when you ask "anyone in der"! Just stupidity in Action!
That poor kid, what a terrible thing to go through
"Good samaritan " you mean doing hes job ?
Video starts with the boy saying his mom is in the water and the guy proceeds to ask if she is in the water 😖 just dumb lol and lack of active listening skills
Please God Lord save this woman and child.....thank you, police Officer and good person...bless them all...please Lord ❤
Thank you Jesus
The world need more good people like this man. God bless you sir.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Oh my goodness 😢 my heart sunk 🙏🏿
Ok everyone i got a follow up. Her name is Jonquetta Winbush,of texas. She did code, but thet resuscitated her, and she just got off the vent this week and is breathing on her own
God bless these people especially the little boy
😢 Help Jesus
❤
My God 😮😢
That is a horrible Cop
Sometimes people can be seizure free after a certai. Amount of time. It doesnt mean the seizures are gone.  Seizures onset can be anything from fever to a trraumatic event.
Amen!!!!
2 Chronicles 7:14  "If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land"
🎉So glad she's ok!!! Great teamwork and all praise for all who helped!! Yay for people being awesome humans!!😅😊
Why does this cop make stupid questions?
They're little boy saved himself
OMG, does a seizure have a prior indicator? 😢 The cop got wet diving under water are they trained for such?
That poor child.
o7
Praise God the man stop his truck to help 🙏🏾🙏🏾  I hope the mother made a full recovery🌹🌹🌹
Is she in there? Is somebody in there? That's what the f*** he said.
Is somebody in there.... waiting for an answer... no ok bye lmao
Cops man. Asking questions that don't matter when that kid freaking out.
😮😮😮😮😮
I need a follow up...is she ok.
I hope she's okay.
I needed the man to move a little faster..idk..I was running to help in my head when the boy  was frantic about mom was stuck in the water
The Police are fantastic,if you think otherwise you’re the problem
Take your time! No rush! "Is the door locked?"
Duh! Is somebody in there? 😑
Bro, the cop casually going to car,, "is somebody in there?" Hello the kid said his moma! Hes the one that needed to step it up not EMS
Yelling is someone in there made me mad. Just go in tthere. That baby said his mom in there 50 thousand times.
I feel so sorry for him😩🙏🏽❤️
He ain't racist today. When empty heads allow demon-crats to dictate to their empty brains......
Damn he moving slow!!!!!!! I guess he has to be chasing him!!!!!!!
Oh my gosh! I'm in tears right now! Poor baby! (I know he's not a "baby", but that's his mama and he is her baby!) I hope Mama is recovering! 😢
That incredible young boy racing his mum, broke my heart to see how frightened he was  How brave ❤
Is making so much effort to get her out no sense of urgency
God bless this cop and the family involved he might not of really liked his job as times as we all do but he was placed in that position for a reason
Heartbreaking to hear his panic and worry.  He is a brave little man - he kept it together through all of that and got her rescued.  Much respect!
This young boy is a hero. He got help and his mom was rescued. Her life was saved. God blessed.
Great job by the kid the cop reacted pretty slowly if you ask me. Hope she lived and is alright. 🙏🙏🙏
How could speak if she's under water and having a seizure? He kept asking is anyone in there...
😢❤
Thank you sir 🙏🌏🤗
😢😢😢 All prises to the emt and boy
Poor little kid!! Hope mom's ok
Oh my Jesus lord Jesus please let all go well.
COPS SO SLOW AND ASKING IF SOMEONE IN THERE THAT POOR CHILD JUST TOLD HIM HIS MOM IN THERE. WHAT HAPPENED DID SHE MAKE IT? SLOW RESPONSE 😞
Bless her
The baby saying his mom in car,he asking is somebody in there,dude crash the water bro,u filming asking i questions,somebody else is saying the lady,sad,they lucky she still alive,but atleast somebody was ther to rescue her,didn't seen like the police was in a hurry to intervene,sad
That cop sucks asking stupid question like is the car unlocked and is there anyone in there, instead of rushing to help the woman.
Prayers and blessings to all involved
Umm the poor kid is telling u she’s in there.
I dont understand why this cop wasn't running to the door to get her out
SoME PEOPLE  CARE ABOUT OTHERS
Bless 🙏
The son crying for his mama on the side broke my heart in pieces. Did she live?
Poor baby
Poor baby🙏🙏🙏. He’s terrified. This breaks my heart.😢I hope he and his mom are okay.🙏🙏🙏
God bless the son and the man you saved the ladyay God keep Bless them to to always have a relationship in Jesus name Amen❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMG my heart hurts for that woman and her son I hate to have him experience that. I hope she's okay.
Bout time police actually protected and served
God Bless you Sir. As well as that momma and her wonderful, and very brave children. I wish the best for you ALL!!💖🙏💖
God bless this beautiful family
Poor son.  That's why folks with Seizure Disorders should NEVER BE ALLOWED TO DRIVE.... COP....That child already TOLD YOU his mama IN that car!
Thank you officer!                😢
Help her!!! She’s in the car!! My mom is in the car!!!   Cop- is ANYONE in the car?!!!!???!
Cop had some really stupid questions after being given pertinent info.
This is so scary!  To be driving with your child and suddenly have a seizure and wreck the car into a pond🫣that boy was absolutely the bravest kid I’ve ever seen.  Quick thinking to get out and go for help.  I’d be so proud of that kid forever!
Thank you Lord for this baby boy and  the first responders.
Omg this breaks my heart 😢 he was so brave and scared 😢
Omg help her please 🙏
Workers were moving kind of slow I think😢
Whys he so slow
Great job, Sir! Thank you so much for your bravery and service! ❤❤❤
Lord have mercy. As a mama, I felt that child's fear, concern, and love for his mom.  How terrifying for them both. I pray mom made a full recovery and for her brave son who experienced such a traumatic event!! 🙏🏾
Y he asking if someone in the car. He just told u stop.wasting time smh
The fact that he’s asking questions that was already given to him in a time where he should be desperate to save a woman.. that he already knows! is in the car, in the water.. the response time is shit
The poor boy was in panic mode. Shocked, gasping for breath. I could feel his terror.
How????? What happened??
Officer took his sweet time
Lord God, thank you for saving her. Heal her Lord, mind, body, and spirit. Grant her the means to persevere and prosper. Let her and her family come to know you better each day. Gift them Your providence, protection, great joy, and deep peace in Jesus' name. Amen
Is mom ok?
My God!!😭😭😭😭
stupid cop is someone in there cmon the girl already told him
The power of God.. what a brave young man.. God bless them❤
Sho' seem like the cop took his precious time... I'm confused 😲
Sure hope they were able to save the mom and I pray she makes a full recovery. Much love n respect to this young man
Well it doesn't say she was saved ..she looks unresponsive the quick part they cut off
God bless
took his time 😮
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️
why does the video stop short?
That poor child.  I hope mom and son are doing better
How scary
That cop did not want to get wet lol
How can this police be so slow and asking stupid questions in a place of accident ??!!
Why was the cop moving so slow
😢
Absolutely Absolutely Absolutely 💯
Kid giving that window hell with that rock for his momma…Soldier
Oh god , that poor baby . The stress he is feeling 😭 good job lil dude ❤ x
Damn! My friend has epilepsy , every time she gets behind the wheel,  i panic 🙃. I pray this lady is ok.😢
"THANK YOU LORD!"
Way to go to take your time to get to the car and ask twenty times “is someone in there” after the boy just told you 5 times before that his mom is in there…
"is she in there...?" Well obviously guy this young boy just came to you or anyone he could find then ran into water yelling mom at the car....id say his mom is in there like he told u
I thought people with seizures shouldn't drive?I hope she is ok😢
God bless boy and mom & officer and medical team came
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 what's the point  his is luck to be alive the way black people have abortions😅😅😅😅😅
Jesus Christ....this is hard to watch
This man believed in the Oath he raised his Hand for. Fearless. 😅
Glory be to God ….. blessings to that man
I don't understand how anyone can get anything negative out of the video.  Some of y'all need hugs!!!❤
How in heck they get in themat water
Thank God for this youngman and that officer GOD SPEED ❤🙏 also the bystanders
Amazing officer and child
The fear in that child's face.. God bless him.
God bless all involved.
Copnot too bright!
The child was doing more than the cop Shm cop moving so slow in my opinion!! Shm
Wow how scary! If you’ve had seizures before please please please do not drive!!!🙏🏻
Lord thank you for sending your heavenly angels to protect them. Please continue to keep them safe. Amen!
GOD is great
Thank God someone was around to help save this kid mom what a tragedy ❤❤😢😢😢
Why ask the kid questions like that? Are the doors locked is she in their. Dipshit cop
This is what protecting and serving looks like. That baby was calm and the officers were in the right place at the right time. 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
oh that poor sweet baby.  he must've been so terrified.  I hope his mother was saved in time
Cop was in no rush to get in that water....terrible
Did the mom make it?
Look how slow the cop was to "save" her.
God bless. Wish the media would put more of these stories on there
❤😢
Staged
That poor baby
That hurts to see this
Oh man that little dude 😢. Hope your Mama's ok!
His pain gives me chills. Thank God for those good Samaritans. I'm so glad racism did not play apart in who gets help.
God Bless you all. 🙏🙏🙏
Is this police officer dumb "is someone in there, is the car unlocked" well he said twice his mom is in there. Assume it is locked.
I wonder could they have popped the trunk?
Praying
God bless that baby boy
My husband and I paid our loans and set up prepaid plans for our kids. I shouldn't have to pay their loans too.
Awesome cop
Po po moving too slow!!!
So my question.... why are ppl allowed to drive when they randomly get seizures??I'm not saying they shouldn't but there should atleast be another licensed driver with her at all times or a grown person... in sa we allowed to drive with learners in  the block only but when going on the road u need a licensed driver present doesn't have to be behind the wheel but he must be present..until u pass out ur license ...
Why did he keep asking if someone was in the car when the little boy is crying telling him his mom is in there
Thank u for saving them God bless❤❤❤❤❤❤
I pray she survived 🙏
That police officer is not a hero
How restarded is that cop? The kids telling you she's in there but you stand there with your thumb up your ass, he didn't save anyone. That guy did all the work.
Poor kid , iam turning into aquaman at that moment
What an idiot police why would you ask if someone in car when the kid is crying in already telling you his mom is in the car needed to be rescued
The cop did not want to get in that water despite having the kids screaming at him saying his mum's in the car he's still standing there he's someone in there is anyone in there hello
She was flying down the road lost it with her kids in the car because she needed to get that stuff delivered😂yay amerika
❤
Thank you! I don’t know how long ago this was but this policemen was awesome 👏🏽 ❤
I thot his dumbass was gonna keep asking. 'Is somebody in there?' U should see how insensitive some of these white lady dispatchers act during life and death situation. Makes me wanna slide on them beaches.
Was she saved?  She was under a while??🙏
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙌🏾🙌🏾❤️
" Is something in there?" 🙄 whatta mean sir ?  He just told desperately his mama is in there 🤨 I swear I always get a few gray hair with these police and 911 oparators delayed reactions.
Omg he’s such a brave human ❤❤❤❤ please someone that’s better than all of us bless this kid and mother this is scary stuff to go thru. 🙏 🙏 🙏
How is that a COP does NOT carry one of those break glass tools for just these kinds of emergencies? “Is somebody in there”? The kids pleas told you there was-DIMWIT.
"Is she in there? Is somebody in there!?" GO CHECK MF!! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ dont just keep asking the kid!
I’ve heard the back window is the easiest to break. Glad a Good Samaritan was there when needed. ❤
According to reports the mom suffered a seizure and went into the water. Her 16 yr old daughter and 12 yr old son were able to get out and flag down the officer. After putting the boy in the patrol car he went to rescue the woman. 2 other plant workers also attempted to help. The officer got the unconscious woman out and did CPR until EMS arrived. She is in the hospital and expected to make a full recovery. Thanks to veteran patrolman Charles Cobb for his quick action.
Omg that poor boy going thru that ordeal. I hope mom was okay for that frantic boy! He did what he was suppose do!❤❤
❤❤ thank goodness your momma was saved.❤❤
Most heroic people would have darted off into the water when they seen the car in there. I just don’t know about some people.
God bless all with peace, love, health, safety, prosperity, and protection!
Praise God
I don’t know the kid just told him that there was somebody in there and then he takes a sweet time to get into the water
God is so good he sent the right person to help. The man that helped them WE appreciate all that you did for this young boy and his mom. I pray one hundred-fold of Blessings into your life . In Jesus name. Amen 🎉
And thank you to the gentleman that showed up on the scene❤❤❤❤❤❤❤.
Kid:  She’s in the water!  She needs help!  Points towards car in water.  Cop:  Is she in there?  Is anyone in there?  Me:  🙄 Look out!  We got a real brainiac here!
He said she was in there asshole, like she can answer him under water
See how he was taking his time the boy said he telling you she didn't know why are you yelling at somebody in there obviously they're in their colonizer
OMGoodness for ur brave save..
😮😮😮😮😮😮 🤔
My goodness this had me in tears. What a brave boy.
👮👏👏👏🥇🥉🎖️👮🫶⛑️🛟♥️🥳           you are much appreciated!!!!!
😢😢
I'm sorry, this person was moving too slow for me. If you could see someone standing in the water trying to get the car open, please stop asking if a person is in the car.
Thank you for rescuing her. However, Why do cops ask questions that they already know the answer to!? 🙄 The boy told him that his mom was trapped in the water and she was having a seizure.
That poor baby 😢 his fear is gut wrenching
Something tells me that the cop didn’t want to get wet.
The kid is telling you his Mom is in there!! Get to the fucking car instead of asking if someone’s in the car  !!!!
Omg I thank him so much for caring ❤
Good job guys .... if we all looked out for one another like that... we would probably argue less and be nicer to one another huh.... easy peazy
That's why i don't drive anymore. Seizures suck
Thank you so much little boy so scared ❤
Oh that brave boy❤❤❤
The LOVE of his parents as strongest bond. Momma, Momma 😢 he found her a hero, an angel. It was a difficult one. He didn't give up. Determined, grit .Cool   Wise.  He did it. Thank You Sir. GOD BLESS YOU. ,And all you Love ❤️ ❤❤
AMAZINGZ shots of the attempts underwater. And the little girl who alerted had a voice and gestures that said " "Don't say no! Help!" ❤❤
Look at the  face off this young man ,i startet crying  he saved his mom  Respect  to this child  and the police men
🥺🫂🙏❤️
Omg he broke my heart. Was she ok after the rescue? Praying she’s ok.
❤
We should get a pair of swimming goggles and small oxygen tank (handheld size) for situations like this so the cop could just run right in instead of shouting for a response from the sidelines …. for situations like this
Where rest of vid
Can you be any slower dude!!!!
That is a brave, loving hero! ❤
❤❤
My, goodness can’t you see the child is in distress, what in the hell you mean if they cared they would of got in the water and saved her. You are Pathetic. 😢
Your an awesome kid, always remember that. You saved your moms life.❤
The cop didn’t seem to concerned at first
Really how stupid is that cop. Is someone in there! When that boy told you his momma was in there.
All that time the officer spent asking if someone’s in there instead of helping could’ve been the difference between life and death.
When are they going to make cars that don’t sink?
Thank you Sir, for saving her! May God protect you and bless you 🙏🏾🙏🏾
That cop sucks
Cop moving slow as molasses... "Is somebody in there?" Uhhh yeah he's begging for you to help his mom. He don't wanna get wet unless he has to. It's another passer by he offered the "punch" to.
Praise God I hope this lady is ok🙏🏾🙏🏾the cries of her child 😢😢😢 for help
What do you have to ask if there is someone inside when the boy already said his mom was having a seizure inside.
God bles everyday heroes.
Blessings to the young man  officer, and paramedics. Hooe Mom is much better.
cop seemed slow to react
I can hear how obese that cop is through my phone speaker.
Sorry but the cop is a fucking coward
Oh my God...hopefully she is okay
THE COP DIDNT HEAR THE DISTRESSED BOY SAY THAT HIS MOM WAS STILL IN THE CAR SMMFH!?!?!?
Hope there ok my prayers to you both.
Kudos to the officer. Thank you for such great service!!
This scares me and is one of the reasons I no longer drive or even want to drive. I’m an epileptic and have had 3 seizures behind the wheel, and luckily have crashed once, and it was into a fence line along the side of the road. Second time was taking my husband to his Dr appointment and I felt strange so I tried to stop the car and luckily my husband got control of the vehicle and the other time I was on the interstate going 75 miles an hour and same thing I felt it coming on, and took my foot off the gas and my husband again gained control of the vehicle and we pulled over safely.. So I no longer want to drive Eve again, my biggest fear is hurting someone else, I couldn’t live with the guilt that would haunt me for the rest of my life…
Jesus
How about putting the damn phone down & using both hands.🤷🏼‍♂️🙄
Did his mom survive it doesn't show pray that she  Survive
Sons love to his mom. Crying😢
It's crazy how calm that officer stayed. I don't think I could be that calm. I would have been frantic😮
It looked like there was a sunroof. I’d go in from up there
So sad I pray they got her out and God be with them both
So thankful for our brave officers in uniform… saved another life ❤
Poor baby boy he saved his momma 's life, God bless him ..
Cop was an ass too.
Brave man you are, little one!!....mighty though small, and a chosen child of God's own creation...caste in his loving arms of protection, you saved another life. Your momma. Bless you❤❤❤❤
As the cop struts over without urgency asking “are you in there?”.  However, glad she made it out.
is the car unlocked!! what type of question to ask that child
Baby’s fear made me cry😢
😭😭😭🙏🙏♥️♥️
Oh how terrifying... He saved her life.. bless his heart..💜
What a loser cop is anyone in there (takes his time) is it locked (continue to take his time ) what a 🤡
I think the officer was scared to go on the water while we ask if she and them in a little boy is telling him his mother is in a car to the officer he didn’t give up and still went
As an individual with 50 years of seizure activity, I surrendered my privilege of having a driver's license for this particular reason. Such a blessing for the little man to go for help! Great job young man!
Praise Almighty God for Those Man!❤❤😢
Driving with a seizure condition is so dangerous. I'm glad to hear she's okay
I hope and pray that his mom was ok, he was so brave and desperate for help, for his Mom!
Praise you Father in Heaven who stays in the saving business. Ty Son for your love and bravery.  and you rock to Mr.  policeman ❤❤❤❤
OMG!
The officer’s sense of urgency left a little to be desired. Quick thinking son saved his mom❤. Hope they both recover well.
God is Amazing 🥲 and always 👂 hears our Cries 😮 Amen ✝️♥️👑🙏
Thank you for helping the young man and his mother. 🙏🏿
Thank God for the child, the Officer and the good Samaritan. 😢😢😢
The cop could have been a bit faster! Praying that the young man and his mom are doing well.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
So what happened!!!!
The lump in my throat right now.... poor mom, poor baby 😩🥺 I'm glad everything turned out alright 🤍
😢😢😢❤🙏🏼 That officer didn't hesitate to rescue her.
My thing is i feel like the cop had no urgency in the beginning the kid told you someone was in the car and he still asked if someone was in there like you should have just drove right into that water after that kid cried like that all in all thankfully they saved her
Poor baby don't have anytime to explain
I am sobing...that poor baby was so panicked and scared for his Mom, I just wanted to hold him.....
Lazy cop…
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
All the people involved are amazing.  God bless all of you.
🙏🏾🙏🏾😢😢😢😢
Don’t squad cars have winches
❤❤ god bless them all
That little boy was so brave, and thank God for good Samaritians.❤
Cop took his sweet time and why would he go out without his window punch the first time.
You are a hero, young man...
Poor baby  Thank Gohe was with her
Y u taking your damn time
Lazy ass cop get in there and find out if somebody in there
Lord Jesus it send chills down my body. I pray his mother is ok. He did a great job getting help, poor boy.
There really are some good cops it's just that few that ruin the rest
She should not be driving if she has a history of seizures.. they’re so dangerous 😭
Is that the same kid from Shameless 😮
Praise god for that little man's bravery.Praise god for that woman's life🙏🫶
Thank you for saving her, all you brave heroes❣️🎉🎉🎉👏👏👏
Why does this officer lack urgency?
❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Gosh that officer moves slow af
😮😮😮😢😢 JESUS
Is the car unlocked!!?? Go fn check!!!
Lord, Jesussss 😢   Quick thinking brave, youngman! Sent me into tears !!! I pray she made it for her son!!!
People with seizures shouldn't have a drivers license
Hat sie es überlebt?😰
Amen Jesus
Little man's cries broke my ❤. Kudos to the cop who rescued her,too. Hope it all turned out well.😮❤
I hope they are both doing ok after this. He was so scared.
My god how dreadful 😢😢
I feel his pain.😢
Thank You Lord for putting the right heroes, son and officer to help! God Bless Y'all!!
Now tell me what kind of question is that. The kid told you his mom is in there.. omg
Did she live?  I really hope she's okay
Ooh my.....this is heartbreaking..thank God shes ok and thanjs to the officer
I don't mean to be that person because i do have empathy for the situation but unless this is her first seizure which by her lovely boys response No. Are you legally supposed to drive? I had a friend r.i.p joe who couldn't drive because of his seizures.
Wow amazing
Brave young man ❤ hope she's ok
And that boy went back in the water to try and help her with the police
Not all cops are bad 😢 that baby saved his momma!!
It's the cops asking is someone In there after he clearly said she was. If she sunk how in the world can speak. Crazy... love the boy for his bravery ❤
If you look at the entire video in my opinion it took way too long for the officer to grab the mom from the car the kid kept begging and begging and then her daughter also came from the car and begged and begged and by the time he fast walked over to the car to get the mom there was already a Good Samaritan trying to get her out if you asked me the cop took way too long thank God she's okay
Jesus help😭😭😭 bless her children and the officers 🙏🙏🙏🙏for saving her 😢😢
It's his damn job as a public servant
The terror in that child eyes
I'm praying in the name of Jesus shall was ❤❤❤🙏🏿🙏🏿
Jeez dude, take your time!
My mom had a seizure, she's stuck in the car in the water!!!!! Cop- is there someone in there? I don't want to get wet... fine I'll slowly walk through the water as slow as possible while this other person rescues the person instead.
The way he was so scared yet talkes so perfectly for the cops was AMAZING!! God bless this little boy.  So glad shes ok!!!
Praise God for the BLESSINGS of HEAVEN YOU ARE ALWAYS A DESPERATE CALL AWAY❤🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️
She created her own angel ❤
Kudos to the good Samaritan who didn't have to help and could've just kept driving.  The boy and the Samaritan nice teamwork.  Saving mom.  Bless you all.
“Is somebody in there” the kid is telling you his mom is in there and to help her!!!! Why is he asking ? Omg the calmness of this man… thank god someone was already in there trying
Glad he was able to find a police men and glad they were willing to help THANK YOU OFFICERS
🙏🙏🙏For the momma!!
Help.., blessings...thankypu father!🎉
What  a brave young boy!!
Cop didn’t do shat but ask a bunch of dumb questions
These clips never give enough info! Did the cop get her out or the EMS? How is she now,? Were there any lasting physical affects?
Why the cop asking if somebody’s in there..
This is the side of police work people need to see ❤
Dang hope she’s alright. I want to know what type phone protector officer has going underwater and all. Prayers
Omg! God bless you Officer. You are Angle ❤❤
There’s some GOOD OFFICERS still in this world !! No matter what, who, or where, they put out their 💯% to render help to save another human being  THANK YOU 🙏🏼 .. to the Officer & other person involved in helping this child & his mom ‼️
The cop is certainly taking his time!!  That child is absolutely terrified and his tone is not comforting in the least!  Asking him if the damn car is unlocked.  Get your funky self over there FAST and see for yourself!  DAMN IT!
The cop was so calm and in no rush.
“Is somebody in there” Wtf do ya think???
That poor child. I hope she is OK.
Praise god from whom her blessings flow❤
Thats the wosrt nightmare to have something happen to Mom.😢😮
Thank God for Good Samaritans who still exist on this earth.
Is she ok?
Does anyone know what happened to her and her son? I’m hoping she made it and has recovered!
Poor baby😢
Cop didn’t seem like it was that urgent but idk hope the woman recovers
He saved his MOMMA!
Praise JESUS 👏
thank you sir for your services ! Leonard Family
In the UK, you are mostly not allowed to drive for this reason. You never know when you can have a seizure except if controlled by medication and you've been stable for a period of time.  Thank God she is safe. That's poor boy 😢
😢😢😢🙏🏻🙏🏻🙇🏽‍♀️
That poor baby was so brave ❤ thank u for saving this Momma
God bless that baby and his mama!! ❤🙏🏾 from the comments, I’m glad she’s doing okay!
😢😢😢 OMG push though friend I'm praying for you and your family 🙏🙏
Uuugh!! 💪🙏🙌🤧 I hope they were able to resuscitate her.  Great job, baby boy🫂❤️
This poor child witnessing that I hope his mother was alright prayers that her and her son are ok
Great job young man. Your a hero and an angel.  Great job to the police and other person for helping him out. ❤
Im sorry but he was moving too damn slow for me.
🥹 omgoodness thank you so much
😢
Move a little slower why don't you
Omg 😲 this video made my hair stand up.kutoes to the heroes and I'll keep my comments on how the car got there cause I don't know 😕
Wie schrecklich muß das Erlebnis für den Jungen sein.Diese Angst um seine Mama geht direkt ins Herz.
Son told cop over n over moms in the car!!! Cop goes to land meets water, stops & ask is anybody in there? Definitely no rush to save this childs mom. She seemed unresponsive-did she live?❤
Oh, the pain that child had, I salute him for his bravery , and pray they are all okay 🙏
Omg these lil boy made me tear up 😢even though he was going thrue these traumatized situations he was able to composed himself to be able to talk to the cop and ask for help all of them are heroes May God bless all of them ❤❤❤❤❤
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank God for this Angel saving this Baby Boys Mother 💕🙏😇🙏💕 Thank God they saved her!!😇😇💖🙌🙌🙌😊
Why tf was she’s driving especially with her son in the car if she has seizures 😒
This young kid watched his Mom have a seizure while she drove into the lake, had to save himself, out of the sinking car to swim out to get help for her. May your ancestors bless you kid. I hope you'll always feel loved and protected.❤
Bro why are you asking "is she in there" is somebody in there" when the boy obviously just came to you desperately crying saying his mom sunk in the water. You're literally just wasting time smh that infuriated me. It doesn't even sound like you cared at all. You were moving at your own speed with no sense of urgency smfh. What a f**king jerk. The other guy and that little boy are the real heroes ❣️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I need an update did she survive I hate when video ends like this now this gonna be on my mind 😢
Thank God for these amazing humans❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤🎉
Stupidly “is someone in there” like anyone will answer him. Can he not see the car or hear what the little guy is saying??? Like Comonnnnnn. I know if that was a white kid then the police officer sense of emergency would be considered way different even way thanks to the dhead police at least he did something
There are good police officers in the world...❤
I glad the officers where around when the little boy needed help for his mom.thank god
😭 my mama heart ❤
😢 oh my gosh I hope she's okay little buddy your a hero your momma is definitely proud❤
Answer this? They can never swim !!!  Why is that?
That cop moves hella slow for those types of situations by the time he got to the car the person probably already drowned.
Poor baby ❤so brave 🙏🏽
God bless the child and the men who help save his mom.
😢
Good on the cop but he was moving slow u cant ask sum1 in a sinking car is sum1 in there
Hallelujah
Thank god that cop was there to help boy n his mom, good job for boy n cop. 😢
Poor little man.😢😢😢
No hurry, ae?
Thats do heartbreaking.
Poor baby😢
Apparently, from the news story, his 16-year old sister was still in the car as well. Thanks God they were saved and mom is recovering.  Did y’all hear the boy say, “Ahh my foot” just before the cop asked if there’s somebody in there? Poor thing was hurt as well but all he could think about was his mama. 😢❤
That cop just took his sweet time. 😠 Thank God she is ok.
He's gonna grow &is already a Hero❤.God bless you Mom He's already courageous, brave in the face of travesty. I'd imagine his momma isn't the only one he's gonna be aHero to in his life.  God bless you Young man❤
The cop pissed me off talkin bout “is anyone in there” as if the car isn’t dam near fully submerged. Mofo took his time like he was tryna avoid doing the job. The fact that someone else had to jump in before the cop “attempted” to help, is very telling. His badge needs a re-evaluation.
God love that child. He is so scared for his Mama. Pray she is ok🙏
Mom is irreplaceable 😢😢😢
Did she make it?
He said everything clearly"She's having a seizure,she's sunk,she's in the 💦 Did any1 else hear him say"ouch MY FOOT???"😢😢😮
I pray all are doing alright 😢🙏🙏

COP SURE TOOK HIS SWEET ASS TIME
OMG I'm in tears just listening to his cry for help. What a great heroes act. Thank you and may God bless, prosper and keep them always to all those paramedic teams out there!🙏🏾🌹🌈✨️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The car is submerged in water and your screaming “is someone in there”. Please go sit behind a desk.
Why did he ask if somebody is in there when the child told him? The lack of urgency is weird ... idgf what happened in the end the people onsight seems to be more of service
mi heart cry this  happen to my family in real life also mi son was five as a car plunge in the harbor in chicago 3 scuba diver was about to go diving and rescue our children at the same time the incident happen . to this day we never been able to say thank to them still searching for help two children past two survive only if Internet was like this in 1989  my heart still cry 37 years we will never be the same .
I'm still stuck on why this camera looks like it's from the 80s.  That poor little guy though! I pray she turned out okay!
If that were Florida, you couldn't go in the water... alligators would attack you!

Any updates on how the mom is?
What wonderful young man and cops stepping in to help❤
Thabk you Jehovah God for all qho rescued the family❤Officer❤EMT❤Son❤
You brought tears to my eyes. million thanks to the police man who saved he is mother.
Stop asking questions and get in there man
Wow. That’s crazy. People can just out of no where have seizures?  I mean I get it.  That’s insane. Especially if you are aware of this but drive anyhow.
Thank goodness for the kids OK and the mother is recovering. But it also has me wondering if she has epilepsy? I’m gonna say it now anybody with the record of having epilepsy or having seizures should not have their license and should not drive. It really sucks but my 33 year-old brother has had epilepsy my whole life our biggest fear was he would get into a car accident and hurt or kill someone and himself and that’s exactly what happened six weeks after our mother died of cancer. Two innocent people have died from the tragedy, including my brother all because he did not want to accept his disability. please anybody with epilepsy or just has seizures from any different illnesses. Please find other resources other than trying to drive yourself. I’m sorry for your disability. but nobody else should be punished for it.
What kind of BS??? Cop taking his time, and asking someone that’s passed out, “Is someone is in there.” 😶
God Blessings to all involved 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Ty god! ❤
cop didn’t want to go in that water he prefer to write tickets and arrest people a kids is telling you his mom needs helps and you asking if there is someone in there GO CHECK 🐷
Omg I hope she's ok
Still filming,instea of useing all hands and brain cells to save that women😢
God please let her be ok
THANK YOU SIR'LUV
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If they was white would he have hesitated the way he did.
The child had to break down several times to get the cop in the water so not a good Samaritan not a good police officer just another Pig that's upset he didn't get to nightstick anyone
God bless yous Amen
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
That child was desperate for help, and he found it!!! Thank you officer for being a man who honors his word and oath.  We know there a good police officers out there doing their job everyday and being of good character.
How did the Momcome out?
I hope to God his mom is okay now. 🙏❤️
This brought tears too my eyes to see this officer bounce right into survival mode for this lady. I wish that there was more of his kind . These days we need understanding from them as they need the same from us
God bless this child, please comfort him 😢❤
Blessings 🙌  to all.
everyone's praising the cops like he y'all didn't notice he didn't give a SHIT, if he did he woulda ran in first ask questions later
Bless you son!❤️
Oz caint fim
Made me shed tears  real tears Im so glad there was help
What a horrible cop. Get you butt to work.   Poor kids.
Thank you to all who helped saved this ladies life ‘ I hope that she’s doing better’ her son was very brave ❤🙏🏾May God Continue to bless you and your families always💜 HEROES GUARDIAN ANGELS
💔 breaking for that baby! Thank you officer!
The desperation in his voice just tore me up!!! Bless this young man and the brave man who helped.
That cop was SLOW AS a sloth...come on man...a car IN the water and you walk???? I dont clap for that. Not a word of support for the kid, just a old man doing his j O b... No further comments or I ll flood the page...
Thank you Jesus for having the cops at the right place and right time.👍🏽💙😇💖🙏🏽
That poor child. That must have been so traumatic. He handled it better than some adults though.
Thank you, thank you! ❤
🙏🙏
OMG 😭😭😭😢 I hope she is going to be ok
God I thank you for sending a guardian angel to help his mommy.  Bless you kind Officer❤
Aw that poor baby!
I sure hope it's not that cup. That's there on a day I need help. He's sure did not seem like he was in any kind of hurry and wasting all that time trying to open a handle. It's not opening.
Please tell me she lived!!!!!😢
Poor Bby… I’m sure that will haunt him.
I’m glad he was able to THINK CRITICALLY!!!!!!and save his Momma!!!!
So glad you were able to help her. What a brave young man.❤
Thank God for her son, the office and the others  Made my heart broken.
Guy was so calm. Glad they were there save her. Seems she had seizure why they wrecked.  Good son.
Damn that cop was slower than a turtle doing a 100 metre sprint, lucky the lady is ok
Cop was dumb
🙏🙏🙏
To GOD be the glory! Blessings to all who saved this lady life!
The kid is having a panic attack, gave all the information that he could, and the cop still asking stupid questions  SEIZURE, sunk, in the water … let’s go is all I would say no more questions need to be asked. And then he asked, is she in there?  What do you think dude? he just told you she was in there. Why are cops and 911 operators deaf?
That boy is going to be a Police Officer, Fireman or Doctor.  May his trauma be turned into saving lives 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾. Thank you for the other men who risked their lives as well.
I don't understand the kid already told you in desperate need before you got there that his mom was in the seizure in the water and stuck are you going to be at like is she in there like seriously
You’re an angel ❤
I so hope she is able to revover and hold on to that baby boy.
That man is one dumbest I've ever seen , seriously .. a child crying and telling  him that she is in the water and that   he/she  can't do the math ? Mm..
😮😢🙏🙌. Thank god they were able to save that ladies life. Brave young boy
Thank God she was saved.
Just to let you know folks. The headrest on the driver and the passanger front seats of the car those prongs are made to break open the window. However you should pratice and add a little wd40 to the prongs once in a while. It is a little harder to get off and you need to be small enough to either turn around with the driver wheel or get the passanger side.
Guard rail should be around all water ways😢😢😭😭
Omg that poor kid
🙏🏼✝️☮💪🚔💞😌
God bless that child.
He was so brave to get out and go find help like that. I know his little heart had to be torn!
C'mon hop in thats a true angel badge or not. Thank you officer for what you do for us.
Thank u Mr cop for saving her that kid was looking for help n I'm glad u were there ..may God bless u ..poor lady hope she's going to be alright hope the lil baby boy will be OK.
Oh my God that poor sweet baby!!! I  am crying for him. What a hero! Thank GOD he was able to get out safely.
My God just help the boy asking is somebody in there jump in man!!!
LORD HAVE MERCY JESUS 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Seriously cop?  Human?  U didn't hear his cries?  Yes, someone is in there!
He pissin me off obviously someone is in there🤦🏾‍♀️
God bless them all!  The child, the good Samaritan, the police officer, and especially the woman who could have died were it not for the other three!
Why is he taking his sweet ass time
Officer took his sweet time.
is there somebody in the car like he was lying,,,,,
If this cop was one level more worthless, no 1 would have been saved...... Is somebody in there he calls out to a car under water, tries the lock door several times etc etc.....
God bless you baby boy
bravo boy….
God bless 🙌 the child and the officer 🙏 ❤
Cop:“Is somebody in there” Kid:”ya my mom I already told you that”
Is the mom ok ❤❤son did he’s part praying for them
Omg, that cop wasting so much time asking questions instead of doing something, luckily the other guy was with him taking action & is the real hero!! Obviously the woman was unresponsive if the son is telling you she had a seizure…
Friendly tip : they make tools that are a window breaker/seatbelt cutter/flashlight. I keep one in each of our cars for this very reason.
What a slow cop
that boy ain't gonna ever wanna leave his mama. i better not hear no bs about people clowning him as an adult still living with his mother. he's her guardian angel.
Oh that baby God I hope is mommas ok❤
OMG heartbreaking this baby. Please tell me they were able to save his mother? Please God please!
The cop took his time but did try to save her
Please, someone tell me this woman has lived
😮Is somebody in there??? Don't you hear ?? Somebody is IN THERE! THE CHILD SAID SHE SUNK IN THE WATER!! HE (the cop) SURE DIDNT SEEM TO BE IN NO HURRY.😢 I hope they're all OK
Thank you for help them 😢😢😢😢😢
Does anyone know if this Mummy is okay? Her little boy is a hero. What a brilliant young man. Bless him. ❤
This is 30 minutes from where I live. Wow
I'm so happy everyone is ok. Thank you for all your help. You are truly an angel who walks amongst us
That's why I do not drive that much.Because I have seen you too.I've been having so bad.I had to move my son in my house and I pretty everyday for my life
I see why they don’t allow people with epilepsy to drive, assuming that was the cause of all this. The pain and desperation in that baby’s voice broke my heart! He just wanted his Mommma safe… 🙏i pray everyone is okay! Anyone have an update?
Thank you❤
😢😢
Praise God..
As a Mama with seizures this is a nightmare. Im glad the mom lived and proud of her little man for getting himself out and getting help. He's a Star man for sure. 💖🦸🏿‍♂️
All the while the cops was messing around thepoor woman might have been holding her breath. What was thhe point of A) calling out asking is someone was in there. He should have acted immediately as if there WAS somebody in there. B) trying the door handle 15 times. He should have known it was locked the first, or maybe second, timre he tried it. The womaan could have died while he was crewing around. What a disgrace.
I hope she was ok! Desperate cry for help! Police officers are everything! Diver, swimmer, first-aider everything ....
Fast acting son and cop!👍🙏🏻
The fact that the officer didn't believe a black child in hysterics telling him she's in there he still had to ask someone else. This is what's happening in the black community when it comes to officials. The first reaction is disbelief until verification. That needs to stop immediately. If it was a white little girl he would have believed her and acted. If you don't know this is the world of the black community, now you do.
Thank you officer for your service. Saving this young boy Mother.😢😢😢
🙏🏽
Poor baby.  God bless! Thank you Lord for her beautiful Son and for the Officer and Samaritan that helped!
Poor Baby
God you are so good
I hope all is well with her thanks to the people who help
Poor baby to have to experience that traumatizing moment.  May him and his entire family be shielded by GOD’s presence protection. Ameen🤲🏽💜
Oh my heart, poor kid 😢
Is somebody in there ???? Yes.... he told you his mom was in there ..... great young boy he loves his mom
God bless this young boy , my heart went out to him.
That poor little fellow and what he experienced is heart wrenching!   I’m glad they got her out!  …he will always carry that image the rest of his life though…❤️
Officer moving like molasses.🥱
If you take time to think about this, with the mom running into the water, this let her and her son both survive.  This is a miracle.  If she had run into a telephone pole, gaurd rail concrete cap, or if she had left the lane of travel and struck another vehicle, this really could have ended in a double fatality.  If youre going to have a seizure and wreck your car, this was the ideal situation.  And also the fact that law enforcement showed up when they did.
Does anyone have am update? Did the mom make it?💥🙏💥
I'm glad she's okay and the kids are okay, but this is why they take your license as an epileptic. The kid knew what was happening, so this isn't a one off seizure. She put herself, her child and innocent strangers that could have been involved in danger. I understand how hard and expensive it must be to not be able to drive but it is not worth your life
Oh my goodness….this precious little boy. God love him and his mom.
Thank God for the 👮‍♀️ rescuing her as well as her son being so brave.👏🏾💪🏿
Thank you for the rescue.
That poor child 😢
When I see videos like this, all I see is race. The HUMAN race.  One.
This cop is Awesome.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Wtf is wrong w this officer. I’m so confused he CLEARLY is just wasting valuable time
I pray she’s okay but also pray she’s no longer driving. For her safety, the child’s safety, and the safety of every vehicle on the road around her.   It’s unfortunate but IF the seizures cannot be prevented with medicine then there should be no driving privilege for this poor woman.
Omg thank God ❤
Thank you Lord he made it out of the car! His fear of loosing his mom broke my heart! I pray that everyone is ok🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
😢😱😢😱😢🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻‼️
😢😢 my god, this broke me, poor baby this is more than tragic
Thankfully the kid was with her or she would not have made it.
Thank God for the boy and the man
Aghhhh gators
Thank God for the brave police officer. I pray they are safe.
I'm glad someone came and helped 😢
Ditto
🙏🏿♥️🙏🏿♥️🙏🏿♥️🙏🏿
Thank God she is ok🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Thank you, FATHER GOD, for having the right person to be in the right place at the right time. To help this quick thinking brave young man. During his time of trouble. Bless the police officer. Amen ❤🎉🎉🎉
Cop::IS SOMEBODY IN THERE.......Person:::GURGLE GURGLE GURGLE
Poor little kid to witness this. But smart to go get help for his mom. May GOD bless him ❤
Omg save his mom 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
See..it's good cops.they get such a bad name.
MERCIFUL HEAVEN. MY HEART DROPPED FOR HIM.
How did she end up in a lake 😮
Gotta say this cop helped but gd he’s dumb as fuck the boy said she’s there my guy wtf you waiting for go
These Officers get called all the time, and they shouldn't yes there are some bad 1s but the good 1s out weigh them stay safe u do such an Awesome job keeping everyone safe
L COP you know bro didn't wanna get wet and help but he was recording so he had to 😂
I love good Samaritans❤❤ 💐
Heartbreaking 😢
Poor baby hope his mom is okay.
Thanks to that citizen ❤️💯
Please tell me they saved that baby’s mama 🥺🥺😭♥️ poor baby, you can see how terrified he is 🥺
That babies cries of sheer despiration..... thisnis why i wont drive with ny medical conditions... knowing full well this could happen too my kids... or i wipe out others.... its not a risk im willing to take. I couldnt live with myself knowing lives were lost because of a choice i made wrong. :(. Bless this officers for helping this mumma and child. :(
This was so hard to watch! I pray mom is ok🙏🏾🙏🏾
That beautiful little boy looks like my son in age and looks and seeing his little self feeling so scared broke my heart.  He’s such brave young man , showed more maturity in an emergency than most adults .  I can’t imagine how terrifying that would’ve been for him sinking in the water and his mum being stuck.  I hope they both get some good help to get him passed this trauma.
Is she in there?  No im just a panicked kids running down the street screaming “she’s having a seizure” and “she’s in the water “ and pointing frantically at the car!!  Seconds matter.  Thank you for saving her life…. But really?
He said all he needed to know. She had a seizure, she sunk she's underwater. And, still he's told to come on "hop in" in his car. Like wtf? He certainly doesn't match that urgency with his own. He doesn't even try to console that boy even in the tiniest fraction. He just asks is somebody in there. He was told that already. And is the car unlocked? Again, wt actuall f$%^&.  His almost lazy, definitely apathetic way of responding to this desperate child's urgent plea for help is just sickening. How about responding with ok Im going to get her out of there right now as he's headed toward the accident and asking if the car is unlocked there. I'm not sorry to say that honest truth. Is that how he would want someone responding if he was in that car? We know it's not. The officer's urgency only escalated once he committed to helping when he entered that water but especially when realizing his ego was threatened by looking less useful than a citizen already working on it. No other threat was there to slow him down. Of course danger can happen anywhere. Maybe a alligator or a snake or an underwater bomb or the drowning mama might try to shoot her way out. Thank God another adult was there who cared more about saving her life than all the dangers in the universe. You all can praise the officer all day long, But the fact of the matter is he isn't responding out of the kindness of his heart and definitely not in a heartfelt manner. He is responding because he has to because he's on the clock, getting paid for a job he chose to have in life. And, it's more than apparent. Thank God that another adult was there who jumped in to help someone in need because it was the right thing to do as a decent human being..
When you have a seizure disorder and tell people that it's not safe to drive but they bully you with ,well you just don't want it badly enough, you're lazy, just do it,i know someone BS,that's no excuse,you still need too,what kind of adult are you,stop being so soft etc. So,you try to power through and end up at the bottom of a pond. Before deciding to be an AH ,understand that some people do have disabilities, it's not an excuse or way out,you don't get to decide what a disability is and who has it,simply telling people that they don't have a condition ( especially without knowing),doesn't cure them. You don't need to know what someone has,you don't need to be abusive, no one needs to be vulnerable around you,no one owes you full disclosure.  I'm saying that because it happens to me a lot too and it absolutely destroys vulnerable people using their entire strength to function at minimum settings,i don't need to hear all of that BS or be destroyed at first try,second try or at all.
If shes prone to seizures, why is she driving in the first place? Lucky the son made it out too.
Not supposed to be driving if you have epilepsy
OMG!! THANK GOD !!!!!!!🫨 GREAT SON !!!❤😭🙏🏼🎯🙌🏼🙌🏼
The baby told you she in there having a seizure so she clearly unresponsive so why would u go over asking is someone in there 🙄he should’ve went straight in the water
That Poor baby ...
I don't think it was physically possible for that cop to move any slower. I don't know why everyone is commending him 🤷🏻‍♀️
Jesus!!!! 😢
She having a seizure plus didn’t you see he was soaking wet!!
Poor kid desperately trying to save his moma is just gut punching! God help his life, and poor mom.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Oh m g is it just me or could that cop move any slower and then to ask the question is anyone in there after the desperate baby said his mom had a seizure and she sunk in the car. The Good Samaritan came out of nowhere and acted way  faster than this cop. I really hope she survived
Oh baby 😢😢😢😢
The Samaritan didn't hesitated hop right in!!!!! An angel at the right place at the right time!!!!
Wow, when You help A CHILD 😢
Could that cop move any slower? Is she in there? Really?!?! What a loser
And to think, Democrats think cops are evil.  His "Tell EMS step it up!" will somehow be twisted into something bad.  Shoutout to the kid who will forever remember this man.  He's probably thinking about becoming a cop.  I hope the woman is ok, for her sake, and the young mans.  I really hope she is fine.
Poor baby !!! 😭😭🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
Praise God She's recovering 🙏🙏🙏
Thanks for the update on this video.  Sending up Prayers for healing, speedy recovery for the mom. Thanks ❤🙏🏽
Did she survive? Omg that poor child
🙏🏾❤️👏🏾😊
Thank god for people like these men
THANK GOD for these brave men,and to the brave son & GOD BLESS YOU ALL!! ❤🙏🏽
Oh my what a hero of a man made me cry in joy
God Bless You❤
Oh my! 🙏🏾 Brave kid! ❤
How is she supposed to answer while she’s underwater 🙄the desperate child already TOLD him she is in there
Poor little boy.❤Blessings to him n his mom
Doesn't look like she would have survived.
I appreciate the man helping, butt why not put down the camera so you can move fast to help. I mean, why do you have to film yourself saving someone's life. I'm a bit torn about this. I hope she survived.
God Bless them all.
Poor little things. Bless you. I am glad he was able to find help.
Wow my god prayers
Thank God for the the little boy and thank God for saving both of them❤❤❤
Papa❤❤❤❤❤❤
Praying amen
My heart is aching 😢😢🙏
Poor little guy. He was desperate for his mom. God bless!❤
Is his mother Ok? This is awful.
The child 😢 was the hero... The Officer seems to don't really care
Sir you're an angel for sure.
Is the car unlocked? Guess fkn what, go and check!! What on earth is going on in thats cop brain...brain on holiday?
I hate these things!!! Leave you just hanging, trying to drag you to somewhere you don't want to go or don't have time for going through all those titles to find the answer I'm looking for and when I leave the short, I never find it again!! Did she make it??? Please tell me she is ok!
Thank you Jesus
PRAISE GOD 🙏
An DEMOCRATS want to defund Police🤬🤬  This video explains Why we need good cops!
Poor thing he was terrified that’s has to be so scary!  🙏❤️🙏
Bless that baby!
This happens a lot and yet I see bodies of water that could have walls built or some kind of safety guard and I never do it they could save so many lives by just building safety rails I see these all over this is where your tax money is going to other people and other countries but yet they can’t use it for our schools for security guards armed guards and for a little teeny walls that will cost a few hundred dollars I’m sick of it
Thank you....❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why is the help being so damn slow....that boy is terrified! STEP IT UP DUDE!!! Geeez "Is somebody in there?" YES DUDE, HE ALREADY TOLD YOU 3 DIFFERENT WAYS THAT HIS MOM WAS IN THERE! This police officer acted like he didn't want to get wet. 🤬
Put tears in my eyes ❤❤❤😢😢😢
Not all police officers earn the hate
I hate to say this but she probably shouldnt of been driven if she has siecers
Lord-Lord... Bless this little boy, I'm so glad that he ran for help! Thanks to all that helped to save him Mom's life 🙏🏾🙏🏾
This was life and death , very tine sensitive and that mans first reaction was to record ?  I guess he was worried he’d get sued or something .    And this is why people are hesitant these days to be  a Good Samaritan .   Or , worse , he wanted the “likes”  for being a Good Samaritan …..either way it’s awful .  Record at all cost instead of moving as fast as possible and using both hands and concentration on saving a life .  I hope she’s alive and not brain dead .  At least he did try .
PLUS A SEIZURE...DAMN! 🤔😱🥺😭💔
How was she supposed to hear him calling? Hmm She is under the water sir.
God bless them❤
“Is somebody in there?!”   Yeah because someone can yell for help underwater….😑 A little boy told you his mother had a seizure and you can see the car is going under water. There’s no questions needed to be asked…sick of these lazy cops.
Cop asking stupid questions
Thank God it seems that officer was near by and available!!!
If you have a history of seizures you shouldn't be drinking
Thank you officer for saving them ❤
God bless this family!  Thank you for rescuing momma
God bless this young man and his family.
Put down the damn camera
I didn’t feel the cop wanted to really help
This made me cry. I lost my momma 7 months ago, and to see this poor baby cry for his momma. Just broke my heart.
God's grace
My Mum 😢😢😢😢 ❤❤
You are a hero young man may God bless you and your mother ❤
God bless them🙏🏼❤️
Check for more cars in that area.
“Is somebody in there “ type question was that… so weird
Thank you Lord 🙏❤️😮😮😮
Praise God for you, Man Of God , for helping them to God be the glory for your wisdom your courage and strength. God bless your family, sir, and the family that you saved in the mighty name of Jesus to God, be the glory for your loving and caring heart, sir. God bless you, Man God, God bless you and your family in Jesus mighty name amen🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇🫶🫶🏽🥰🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Thanks to all ❤
Thank you God for REAL men and thank you for the officer who saved her. What a good and brave son...
Thank you Jesus you so awesome.
Thanks to these officer
Poor little boy 😢

Thank God for you and others saving this mom, your wonderful, tuff job and your special for being an officer.
This baby.  It looks like a pretty quiet area.  I thinks it’s amazing that someone was able to stop and help
❤❤❤ God Bless You
Why am I 😢😢😢
Thank god for good ppl 🙏🏾
Is she in there? What a slow ass question ?
That cop is an idiot and has no sense of awareness or urgency like the hysterical crying kid told you she had a SEIZURE and is under WATER!!!!!!  And the cop 👮‍♂️ is gonna calming say “Herrro??? Is someone in there???” Boy if don’t jump yall scary butt in that water and save that women God is gonna have a good talk with you on judgement day cuz thank YAH🙏 that another Good Samaritan was already in there trying to set her free while the cop was knocking on the trunk asking if anyone was in there🤦‍♂️😡
Omg thank god they safe.
Thank God for these man happened. This young man to save his mother.
Not gonna lie I'm slightly frustrated about how the cop approached the flipped over, submerged car with a soaking wet kid beside you screaming his mother is in the car. Why did the cop waste time to bother asking "IS ANYONE IN THERE?" The kid, while traumatized, exhausted, terrified, hysterical did an amazing job at explaining the situation to the cop and the cop still asks "uh is somebody in there?"
Heartfelt the emotions for his beloved momma. Lord Jesus thank you for the recovery.
Thank you.  I pray she and her son are ok 🙏❤
That poor baby. God bless his heart❤️
Poor kid. I got chills.
That cop taking his sweet time. Asking if anybody there and the little boy just told his ass... I can't with cops. Smh!!!
The cop didn't want to get his shoes wet 😂
Thanks to the Police man and EMS and anyone who helped to get her out. I hope she is ok.
How does this woman have a driver's license
What an absolutely horrifying event. Her son is so brave !!!!
I'm sorry but is the officer knocking on the car door underwater and asking if the car unlocked
Why is he asking is there some in there the kid just told him tht shit
“Is somebody in there??” x2  *BRO YOU HAVE A PANICKED CHILD TELLING YOU THERE IS* dive tf in! WTH
Oh my God
❤❤❤😢😢😢🙌🏽🙌🏽

Wow! Thank God she's  a ok, and for those heroes. What a brave boy
Thank God for the Samaritan, the good Samaritan🙏
❤
Bet that cop weighs like 400 pounds and has that typical butch haircut they all have out there in the south with a mustache and confederate flag on his porch
Praise Yahuah El Elyon for this man 😊❤❤❤❤
Praise God for this Rescuer!
Hero❤
When it comes down to it....we all need each other.  United we stand devided we fall.
That young kid was so brave. Thank you all for saving the lady. ❤❤❤
Is the car unlocked bro stfu and figure out
I was 30 when i saw my dad have a seizure and all I could do was scream lucky my best friend was there to call 911 but this young boy was able to articulate to the officer what was happening so clear I’m so proud of him and hope mom is well❤
I could never live in the south. Too many racist David Duke cops. And I'm not even black.
Thank God she was rescued.. Poor baby boy!! ❤❤❤
So sad glad shes ok
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh my god I feel so bad for that young boy.   I hope his mother is okay. Does anyone know how this turned out?
Glad they specified that the good Samaritan was separate from that cop. The cop is no hero imo. Took his sweet time to save the woman and we all know why judging from that southern drawl...
😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤Thank God she is ok
He cry for his mother help her 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The way the cop asked is anyone in there is somebody in there,? Really good who's having a seizure when she had the accident, like u think shes going to pop out like yessir Im in here come help me , good thing her Son ran to get help n the cop stopped n the other man was there already, to help him. CD
Bless this lil boy I pray all is okay .
That poor baby got understandable frustrated for a sec. I get it babe! However, Thank GOD... ALL IS WELL❤❤👏🏾👏🏾💪🏾💪🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
The cop did helped but it seams like he didn't believe the boy at first and even when the cop saw the car in the water it looked like he was moving so slowly and still doubting the boy if I saw a car in the water I definitely would be moving a lot faster especially if I knew someone was in there. Also if that cop really was a so called hero then why don't they show the lady alive in this small clip The poor women was dead weight in his arms.
Sorry for being so stupid. How this woman is allowed to drive epileptic?
boy u a hero you save yr mama bless your heart love you
I wonder how the boy got out!
❤praying
THANKS FOR THE GOOD SAMARITAN COP.
“Is somebody in there” no the kids just yelling mom and running to try and catch the car are you stupid?
Totally respectable, the officer needs to be accommodated for his bravery .
Could that cop have moved any slower?
I pray 🤲 my divine to safe our people's lives 🙏 ❤️ 🤲
Country ass speach
❤Thank God the police officer was able to get her out! I pray she is well!
Thank God that officer helped but he wasn’t moving fast enough in the beginning. Seconds are important in drownings.
Did that cop piss anybody else off
News article: white officer tries to drown black woman
😢 such a brave young man I feel for him
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I hope this child's mother is okay. Thank-you to the man who went in the water to get her. I hope she's okay.
He just saved his momma’s life he’s a hero. Kudos to you young man.
I APPRECIATE THEM AND MAY BLESSINGS COVER OVER ALL OF THEM....
Lord bless this family in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
Amen
This cop should be fired. Intentionally taking his time . He waited till the car was completely submerged before we took action
All ThreeAre Brave Heroes
Poor baby 😢
🙏❤
Can we get an update on the mom?
I thought people what's epilepsy weren't allow driving privileges.
Mum should be proud, she's obviously raising young man right, I hope she makes a full and speedy recovery ❤
Please don't drive of you get seizures
It's amazing how slow they react ... Really  it's life and death and the move so slow..
Am i the only one who thinks this cop sounded reluctant af? The boy said repeatedly that his mother was in the car and yet he kept asking?
Dummy ,I'm sorry ,
Baby boy god bless you god bless you son x
Could that cop move any slower
JESUS 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank you Lord❤
Bless that baby! I pray he heals from this! I know his mama is so thankful for her little hero! I pray mama heals too! 💕🙏🏼
❤️
Hes telling him and he still asking if sombody in there?
OMG Lord please give him the strength to save her😭❤❤
Thank God those people helped!❤❤
So how did the kid get out ? All doors and windows were shut. 🤔
Why keep asking is she in there ? The boy made me cry 💔 my heart goes out to him
Does anyone know if she's okay???
Prayers for the boy that this traumatic experience does not stay with as a curse of fear, but God will turn it into a blessing give him strength and encouragement in all things. In Jesus name I pray, Amen!
Police cars should have mandatory tow strap in the trunk.
Great job God bless you, without Our LORD JESUS CHRIST we wouldn't even know what Miracles and True Love really means 🥰🙏❤
It’s a lot of GOOD PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
🙏🙏🙏🙏
So scary
Thank you for rescuing her
GOD S presence I’m sure helped them all save her life he seen his child  begging for help all his children jumped in  how wonderful 🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏🥰
They be asking HELLA STU PID QUESTIONS. JUST GO. WTF ELSE ARE YOU DOING.. OUT THAT DONUT DOWN!!
He asking to many damn questions 😢
I rarely say this but to the officer who helped, "thank you for the work you did without a moments pause. You have instilled faith in the police again for me. You don't work for the police, you serve your community with courage."
I hope  she  OK
May this woman have a speedy recovery and hug her son for eternity ❤
Thank you Lord ❤❤❤Thank you officer...
Jesus send his angles
Cop doesn't seem to care to much
Such a brave little boy. God bless everyone involved!
I want to know if she had a history of seizures?
Oh, sweet child, this brings tears to my eyes
What A Brave Young man I'm so proud of you❤🎉😊
That precious boy
Intense😮
We saw it in the Greek news.,!😥 God bless you.! We are happy for you ☺️ you are ok and that's the thing ouff 😮🙏🏻🕊️ 🇬🇷
😢😢😢💔💔💔💔🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🧸🧸🧸🧸🌹🌹🌹🌹
can't have "Good Samaritan, cop rescue woman" for having them do their job, that's like having the title "Good Samaritan teacher, teachers children"
Thank God for his protection and his angels
Thanks to the officers ....they totally changed this young  childs future...he keeps his mom.  Praise God
Bless em Lord🙏🙏🙏
Thank you Jesus all things work together for the good of your people ❤..
The beauty is that God blessed this man this man he to get a waterproof phone he didn't know when how I was going to be used one day he didn't know that you know that God that you and living God was going to use him to save somebody in a situation like this we never know how God uses us this is why we have to be careful how we treat people and how we think you never know who God is going to send to help save you or help you this man just added edit blessings to his life by saving someone God continue to use this man in many ways only God has the power to control the mind the heart in the spirit this man just added to his More to his blessings and his life the wheel of saving someone❤❤❤
I don’t understand the empathy of the people in the comment section, like are you really gonna sit there and pretend you feel anything for these people? Like… you don’t know them? So why pretend at all like you care? One or 3 people being departed from the world is literally a grain of sand in the long run.  I feel nothing for any of them and I just don’t get how you people can sit and pretend to be empathetic, it’s effort. Let alone ACTUSLLY feel something for what I’d personally see as pixels on a screen playing a role designed to make you feel bad.
I'm so glad he was with her, so she could get help❤
My God bless him no one but God
To God be the glory amen
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Put down the camera and save the woman!
Aww my heart.😢 Baby boy was so scared. His fast thinking saved his Mom. ❤❤
He fucking tell u his mom
God bless all that jumped in and son ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Thank God he was with her . My glory goes out to her son . ❤God bless.
People with seizures probably shouldn’t be driving.  Was she ok?
Wow this made me cry 😭 I hope she made it out alive and ok
LORD HAVE MERCY BLESS HIS ❤HOPE HIS MOM OKAY PRAISE GOD
Great police work and a w I wonderfull son!
That was hard to watch. Made me cry.
Idk if he was real cup how can you gonna ask if somebody if somebody in there???
May God Bless The Mom, Son And The Rescuers🙏
I'm sorry, but was it me or was he moving like he had no place to go?When there's an emergency, move your backside like you got someplace to go 😢
THE REAL HEROS ARE HER CHILDREN & THE MAN WHO WAS ALREADY IN THE WATER WHOM SAVED HER 🙏🏼
✝️❤💪🙏
Yeah, ask more questions. I’m sure she got enough oxygen to survive charge crying mother day and he’s asking hundreds of questions
❤❤🙏🙏🙏
That poor baby the desperation in his voice kills me 😢
🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Thank You to the gentleman for helping Son and Mom. I know I would have panicked so bad. Hope all are well, PLEASE post an update 🙏
Poor baby having to go through that. I pray they both recover from this and Mom health is better 🙏🏽
Praying for him and his mom😢🙏
🙏💝🙏
That guy was slow as fu.k
That cop was in no rush to do anything he's disgusting
Poor kid. The face of pure terror. She’s probably his whole life at that age.
That cop so slow. Smh. The boy clearly stated she was in there. Why waste time asking multiple other similar questions. Just go save the woman.
Yes! The desperation in his voice got to me & when he called out for his Mama! Glad she is in the ICU and weaned off of the ventilator! Thanks so much for the update!!
🙏🏾🙏🏾
He could have lost his life trying to save hers. May he never lack. May him and his generation be blessed beyond their wishes! I hope the woman is back to her fit and i wish her more healthy and glorious years by her son!
Did the boys mother survive,  does anyone know.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
No, no take your time😡😡😡😡 hey you think you wanna speed it up a little bit to save this poor woman her frantic child just told you she's in the car!
Poor baby!!! My heart! How terrifyingly traumatic. I pray for peace over this family, may he recover mind, body and spirit in Jesus name! I pray for healing for Mama, in Jesus precious name, amen!
"Is someone in there!?" Obviously you idiot! 😑
Not really sure how much the cop helped there 😅 He reluctantly entered the water, jiggled the door handle too many times while watching another guy get her out of the car. I mean, he had a radio to call EMS at least 🤷‍♂️
Omg that poor little boy is somethin else. Wow
Was she okay? 😢
❤❤❤
Man I'm really glad that other person was there❤
Thank God that those people where there
Is momma okay ❤🙏🙏🤗 protect this lil one and his mommav😢
I hope that she's okay!!
People are so worried about the woman. All I'm thinking is that she's probably had seizures before, since the kid knows what they are. Which means she's KNOWINGLY ENDANGERING people on the road every time she gets behind the wheel. I have no sympathy whatsoever, I'm just glad no one else was hurt.
Why is he shouting is anybody in there? The boy clearly said his mum sunk- he brought you to where she was- if anybody was in the car which is under water did this officer really expect a response? And that delay if it was only this officer could have meant the difference between life and death. That man that was there trying to get her out was a true hero 🙏
❤ God bless this little boy and his mother his cries sent chills up my spine
Oh my God bless this family 🙏 Lord and please help and save her life her children need and love her 🙏
this kid already tells him my mom is in the water and he hesitates and asks is somebody in there, so stupid. that woman is counting seconds
He took his sweat ass time
No sense of urgency after having all critical information... Glad the child and his mother made it out due to the brave Good Samaritan. If they weren't there i would question the outcome of the situation.
I pray the mom is ok …. 🙏🙏🙏
How the hell she drove in there
It says she drunk on the screen. But he said she sunk.
Why is he moving so slow
That poor baby!😭
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😢
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Cop what Do  you mean? if she's in there, if somebody is in there ?
This child pleading for help for his Mom got me. He's a brave young man and a quick thinker. Help her please.
Pray they are all ok😢
I'm not sure, but it sounds like the child said "she's sunk", not "she's drunk"?
Το καημένο το παιδάκι 😢
I dont know if its just me but…. That cop was slow to respond whether she was saved or not.
Health and safety says wait for appropriate service's ie fire service. Some men just do what is morally right
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
They took way too long. Im sorry those extra moments the officer took to think about taking action were crucial. The little kept screaming help her because he paused.
Wow!  The poor child!  The desperation he must’ve felt?!  I hope his mom is okay!  Prayers!  And I hope that child recovers from that horrible trauma!  That’s gonna stick with him forever!
The cop asked is someone there multiple times as if he is not wanting to go In There and was so nonchalant. Let’s give the kid and the man who was already there the credit
Thank God,  I hope you are ok I am praying for both of you❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂❤❤❤
😢❤😢❤😢❤
Cop waited long enough. "Duh, is somebody in dere?"
May God give them strength
O my God please  help😂😂
Why is the police officer saying here he is a punch why is he doing his own f****** job as a public service why didn't he just busted back window out you need to speak to an attorney
A seizure behind the wheel... lord😮😮😮😮 that baby
My heart breaks,,
Great job young man getting your momma the help she needs
🥺brave son, he was able to get out by himself, I think, 😭God Bless them ❤ wishing her a speedy recovery🙏🏻
Man what the f*** is you waiting on
Poor baby 😞😭
Praise God for the man and the cop saving her along with her son
God Bless
I really wanna just hug that little fella. That poor scared little boy😢😢😢. Hes a little hero. Hope he was rewarded for his bravery.  ❤
Blessed son ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg that poor little kid wtf is that cop doing!!!!! Get in there and save his momma dude tf!!!
Why in the world does he keep asking if somebody's in there?? The child is begging him to save is mama! 😢
That is one terrible cop
Little hero, got himself out and found help. The men were hero’s just jumping into that water to save another human. Hope they all recover.
My God
I don't understand why the cop was standing there asking questions before immediately reacting! Suppose the person couldn't holler out so that means he wouldn't have gone in? His response was too damn slow for me after a kid is standing there telling you there's a car submerged and then you get there and you're still questioning it which means he didn't quite believe him!
Officer Goober.
Made me cry , amen
🙏
How the hell does someone whip out a phone to record in a huge emergency.
That poor child I hope her Moms alright 😮😮😮
Boy for this young man to see his mom if she don't make it will b something devastating 😢 Lord help please!
Why is he asking if someone is on there when the damn kid just told him she’s in the water. Lord you cannot make this ish up. Any other regular person would have dove into that water. This is exactly what we citizens talk about when dealing with officers. They ask to many damn questions at inappropriate times
This lovely child brought tears to my eyes.😢
Update on mom 😢
Did they survive please god say they survived just a yes would make my day this is sad lookvat the kid frantic please godcthey all survived
😮😢🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank God 🙏❤️🎉🎉
That cop wanted nothing to do with that water though.
Thank god for the good Samaritans, the cop is too busy asking questions, is she in there? Is the car unlocked? U know she is in there bro, come on!!!
😢😢😢
POOR LITTLE ❤😇❤FATHER IN HEAVEN  I KNOW U ARE THERE WHEN G❤D IS IN THE MIST NO WEAPON FORM AGAINST U SHALL PROSPER THANK Y❤U G❤D THANK Y❤U ❤😇❤✝️🤲🏿👐🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
I hope they are all ok.❤❤❤
That little boy broke my heart 😭
Glory be to GOD!!!!! GOD bless you all!!!! 🙏💕
The cop was useless. Asking stupid questions without any sense of urgency.  I ran into a microburst on 10 in Louisiana right after a hurricane in 2021, and a car ran into a ditch that was already 5ft deep. I was in that car in 30 seconds with my halligan, trying to rip open the door, with bloody hands from the cracked glass...  Have some sense of urgency ffsakes And lost the halligan in the water.. I just left after the cavalry arrived.
Omg, his poor cries just broke my heart. 😢
She was submerged in water. Hopefully, she recovered
Bless all involved- especially that little boy. ❤
Please post how to rescue someone in such a situation: how do you get them out, how to prevent from drowning yourself?
JESUS JESUS JESUS  MIGHTY G❤D BLESS THEM IN JESUS MIGHTY NAME AMEN ❤✝️❤🤲🏿👐🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
That cop dis t seem to hustle much on savi g her.
Great job officer..serving and protect! Excellent representative! Great job kid for being persistent!❤❤
Why waste time asking if shebis in there when the boy already said so.
On my key chain is a window breaker/seat belt cutter. This is an actual fear I have due to having dreams since childhood that I was drowning in a car
O my God 😢😢😢😢 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Thank you Lord.
Got me in tears all I could think about is my boys
Oh bless him. That's gota be so traumatising. He's a very brave young man. 👏❤
He broke my heart. I dont think that angel will ever forget how bad that traumatized him. God wrap your loving arms around that child and give him peace.
God bless
He asking is someone is in there is mind blowing
I also felt like the cop didn't really believe him.hes soakin wet,outta breath,cryin, and panicked but u still asked 3 x if anyone was in the car.u only rushed when u remembered bodycam most likely.
He said, "Help her so much time. You the officer were still asking if someone in there like the mom drowning can really say yes I'm im here bless that boy and the other person
🙏
The boy is panicked but no one else is. He’s been saying she is in there, they keep asking, is she in there. Anyone in there? Stupid
"Is somebody in there" bro GO CHECK
Go see
THANK YOU JESUS!🥹🙌🏾❤️🙌🏾
That man helped, but he was very SLOW in his actions… if some kid came running out of the water, screaming that his mother was having a seizure and was in the car that was sinking in the lake. I just feel like the reaction would be much faster and more intense. It’s wrong to judge anyone in the situation and yes thank God she was saved - I’m just saying… 😮
She’s in the water cop is someone in there 🤦🏽‍♂️
idk if its protocol or what but it made me a lil angry when the police officer asked "is somebody in there" when i clearly understood the boy when he told the officer the first time. he is in absolute desperation, why make him say it twice!!
Officer, your lack of urgency is quite disheartening. Although you did save her, your urgency needs a bit of work to how people need help. Glad everybody is fine.
Again good cops saving lives.
😢😢😢😢
Somebody plz tell me she's ok!! I feel so traumatized for this baby
❤❤❤❤
That boy is a hero right along with the adults who got her out. 😢Bless his heart
Thank you for helping her. God bless the boy and the cup.
Thank you Lord!!
😢😢😢 oh my God imagine what the little boy going through thank God somebody came to help them 🙏❤️🙏
Lord!!! How is she doing? Does anyone know? Thank you for all who helped her.
Useless cop....
Whew the little boys plea just brought me to tears 🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭
I pray she survived 🙏🏽 😢
❤my God! The cries of this boy.😢 I hope all is well and the mother is doing fine.
Awhh
Thank you a for saving the women GOD BLESS YOU ALL❤❤❤❤
Great rescue
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I pray she survived and she’s fine. Prayers go out to the family. I know all too well how that is my son suffers from epilepsy. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Seizure? That's terrible, terrible.  Thank you to all the heroes starting with the son, the good samaritan,  the cops, the EMS, the doctors,  the nurses, and the  tech.
Why we cannot have a license 💔
God is good 👍 🙏
👍
Saw that on the news yesterday how is the mother doing today did she wake up😮❤
Hero kid.. ❤
👏👍🙏❣️
The little boy runs the police officer and says there’s a lady in the water she’s having a seizure then they get to the car and he waits to get four different responses of if somebody’s even in there before he tries😮
Baby boy's desperate attempt 2 save his mommy 💔
😢❤
😮God Bless this young boy❤❤❤❤
That baby deserves a purple heart. Yeah it's a military thing but he showed so much bravery to help save his momma...
One minute it's BLM and next minute it's 911
What's fucked up is? They'll pull that gun and shoot when their life's in danger But if somebody else's life is in danger, they won't pull that gun and shoot out the window. They'll sit there and tap on the window with a rock. Thinking that Little Rock's gonna break the window. Right, no, it didn't.
Hope She's OK Lord Help Restore Life
Bless the police officer and the child there are still good police officers out there❤
Is someone in there? Uh, Sir, that’s why they got you.  Is the car un locked? Dumb cop. It’s in water. You can’t just open the door. Smh He wasted a lot of time just being an uneducated dumb dumb
That was the slowest fkn save I've ever seen. On the edge yelling GO FASTER D'MASSSS!!! BRAVO TO THE YOUNG MAN ✊BLESSED BE!
God is good
Praying God will spare her life. She has an awesome testimony. Thank God for everyone for their help.❤❤❤
Please take away her license my brother in law had his taken away for seizures
Thank you law enforcement❤
And????
He saidat contact pount she in car, his clothes wet.  And he keeps asking IS SHE IN THERE???? DF..... SECONDS CONTED
“Is somebody in there” the boy is telling you his mom is…. No sense of urgency at all wow. Just wow
😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻🙏🙏🙏
Even in his distress, he was so articulate. Most people would've been a frantic, blubbering mess, unable to speak. At least I would have been. Kid's got grit. Heart of a warrior this one has ❤
Thank God he was able to get help for his mom I know that had to be awful and scary thank God
That cop was in idiot why you asking questions jump in to action 😂😂
Breaks my heart seeing this child so afraid for his Mom!
Drunk. Leave her there
That cop did nothing but stall and ask redundant questions instead of acting and trusting the child and just believe what he said and get his a$s into that water with more than one foot in front of the other. He should have jumped as far as he could to dive in a hasty manner. But this cop took his sweet as$ time and asked the same question over again after he had been told she was having a seizure and she went under the water. He isn’t a hero, but a latent liability for the next family that needs by action.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Praise God for putting good people near by. Bless that beautiful boy, the officer and the good Samaritan who saved her life.
If you go look at the original video he really didn't step in the water the little boy did the job oh yeah what a officer huh yeah okay😢
Take your time poorlice. Jesus, unbelievable. Anybody n erh. Id rather not get wet. Maybe if they were &_;+@
I saw this on the news, it was amazing rescue, from the police and a passerby, she was driving, and had a seizure, she hit a railing and the car ran into the water. God bless all of them! 🙏🏽🙏🏽💪🏽
Mr cop...the boy had said his mom's in the car..car in the water..so, do you expect mom would answer your question?🙄
Is she ok😢❤
O my lord I do pray that she be alright thank god for the police being in that place right time pray blessings on everyone 🙏💞
Stupid questions. Get in there already.
Is the door unlocked??
Oh my God, I hope the mother is OK. Thank God that little boy knew what to do.
...IS SOMEBODY IN THERE??? REALLY? THR BOY IS TELLING YOU!
I pray Mom is okay. The child was so brave to get help. The officer did not hesitate. Awful situation. God bless you all.
Awesome is an understatement so glad for such positivity on that day
I’m glad they was able to help 😢❤
The officer walking up all slow like it’s not an emergency .
Thank God for her Angels..hope mom is doing BETTER! The children and the officer were her Angels and heroes
God bless this baby for getting his mom help!!!!
That man could careless about what that boy is trying to tell him. You can hear the woman screaming for help and he asks more than once if anyone is in there. He should be demoted if he’s a police officer. Put him on a desk away from people who need urgent caring people. And I don’t mean an emergency phone operator either. How shameful for that man to downplay and be redundant instead of just believing what the kid said his “mother had a seizure and she’s in the car.” He then Proceeds to ask if anyone is in there. He has not gut instinct to act and save someone without “confirmation” first. He’s not a heroic man, he’s hesitant to go into the water. It’s all very clear how this man does not share this child’s sense of urgency. That child is his mothers advocate. That child doesn’t even realize the man he is pleading for help and explaining his mothers situation does not share is urgent need to save his mother. That very sad. If that was that man’s family in that car, you would see another action. That is unjustifiable! Absolutely shameful. I hope his mother survived, her arm at the end looked lifeless. 💔
OMG my heart... I wish I could just hug him... What a brave young man to save his momma 💙💙💙💙
Neither one of them saved her God did thank you Jesus ❤❤
Bless you sweet boy, you were so brave. I pray for you and your moms safety here on out, and that God touches her. 🩵🩷
They always  give the police to praise first
That poor baby!!
It shows that all cops aren't
Like someone is supposed to answer when the car is under water 🤨
PART 2  WHAT HAPPENED TO MOM
I wish we knew what happened. I pray they got her out in time!
My prayers goes out to that family 🙏🙏 Every time I watch this video I cry., this little boy will forever be blessed by God, for loving and getting his mom the help she needed.  Thanks too all God’s Angels who helped saved his mom. I pray she’s all well, and the family is happy,all together.!! 🙏🙏
Looked like the cop was afraid to get wet.  Good samaritan saved the day
My Heart brakes for this kid.
Please let us know she survived. That child ran to find her help.
God Bless you! You were so brave.
This cop is dumb because when you see a car u Der water you don't just ask if Anyone is in there when the boy said that his mom car is under water and sadly to say this cop didn't really care by his Attitude , he took his sweet time acting like it wasn't a big deal
Is this cop special ed?
I hope she was ok.
White cop racist...as hell..he didn't  really want to help...
Bro took long enough
Prayers are going up for everyone involved. 🙏🏽
I hope she’s ok when having epilepsy you are supposed to surrender your license to motor vehicle she could’ve killed her son or someone else and innocent by-stander or a child people please think before u get behind the wheel if she wouldn’t killed somebody she would be charged with first degree manslaughter and went to jail what would’ve happened to her poor children he has tears in his eyes god bless my heart goes out to family
My God!!! Thank you all for rescuing her. I pray she is well. Praising God.
No, she’s not in there. The kid’s lying. The guy trying to get her out is in on it.🤦🏾🥴
Sending healing 🙏
Thats crazy that myyl neck of the woods. I hope everyones ok.
After the Child Told you she’s in their who was he expecting to respond while you are drowning
omg I pray she recovers fully and no more accidents occur
🙏❤️🇺🇸
Dumb women
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Bless his heart 😢 i hope momma is ok
Oh lord jesus save her life
Stupid cops are there anyone in there. The kid kept telling the dummy my mom is in the car
Jonquetta Winbush’s two children, a 12-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl, managed to get out while Winbush was having a seizure in late July, West Orange, Texas, Assistant Police Chief Jessie Romero said Wednesday. Winbush then passed out and put her foot on the gas pedal, plunging her vehicle into the pond.  Body camera footage from veteran patrolman Charles Cobb, who was nearby monitoring traffic, shows Winbush’s son frantically approaching the officer.  “She’s having a seizure. She’s sunk,” the boy told Cobb. “She’s in the water. Help her.” Cobb put the boy in the back of his patrol car and raced to Winbush’s vehicle, which was almost completely underwater. Two workers from a local plant had already gotten in the water to get Winbush out, Romero said.  After dragging Winbush from the pond, Romero said Cobb administered chest compressions.  “She was totally unconscious,” Romero said. “He was able to get a pulse back while he had her there on the ground and revive her until EMS got there.”
He is so scared for his mother
No more driving!!! EVER😮
What a slow reaction for a cop with a child screaming HELP! WTH
😢😢😢😢
It’s the fact that he is losing more tone asking the dumb question “Is somebody in there.” When the child JUST told him his mom is in there. 🙄
❤❤❤😢
This took forever!
What a brave little boy
Thank you both for saving her!💙✨️
I get the impression that cop would’ve let that woman drown before getting wet
"Is SoMeBoDy In ThErE" while that little kid is screaming my mom's in there he lazy AF for sureee😂 bad crappy cop
Cop had no sense of urgency.  Poor kid, thankfully that other person was helping
Thank u LORD, timing was right ❤
I hope this wasn't purposely done
Why was she driving if she has seizures. Driving is contraindicated. I hope that this is investigated further. Was she advised by her doctor not to drive?
The woman died. She drowned.
Good kid 😢
Thank yall for such a quick response. I pray ALL are ok and with increased health❤❤❤
I’m not going to just label him as a cop. All three are humans with morals and good values. He paid attention and was calm. He listened to that young man instead of seeing his color and asking crazy questions. The other man instantly jumped in before the cop arrived and was risking his own life to save someone else life. GOD put those men in the right place that day. They had an open heart and mind. This is what this world needs more of, instead hatred. I pray that everyone was ok. I ask that people get out of a bubble and realize we live in a world full of different people and GOD wants us to love one another
I am not crying, my eyes just like pretending that they are waterfalls!!!! 😥😥😥😥
It looks like the cop took his time
That cop’s sense of urgency sucks. He was taking his sweet time. 😤
Oh my lord my heart broke for this boy and the policeman that helped great job all we see these days are people dissing on police nice to see the other side I hope that poor woman is ok 🙏
Bless u SIR 4ever 😮😊
I just looked it up. She was having a seizure and passed out they got her out they had to do CPR but she's doing better
The good samaritan saved that woman NOT the cop. The good samaritan was there first and ultimately got the lady out of the car! It's literally on video.
When every second  counts  , walk slow, and ask questions  ?????? Wtf
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
She shouldve went to a pedestrian he act like he didnt wanna go
Poor baby!!!!! I hope she’s ok.
omggg poor thing ...can't help imagining if he hadn't found anyone to help save mum 😮😮😢 wow hope they r both doing well n the heroes ❤
That cop made me so angry when he didn’t just diving into the water. You beautiful baby boy, you’re an angel.
I am weeping. Poor child.
I’m glad the child repeated himself 18 times his mom was in the car… the cop seemed confused
In Florida that cop is brave going in those waters without like something to protect him from gators right away brave and a little dumb
She was having a seizure
Poor baby
😢❤
Awee that child is so scared for her but so brave and smart went to get help spoke through his panic said the right things and got them where she needed ♥️♥️♥️
Heroes!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Is she ok😢,, please let her be ok for him, he loves her so much..
I felt that boy so much, ny mom has epilepsy and we hit a tree one year and we cpuldve died,i had to get out and get help with an internal bleeding liver.
If you saw a crocodile 🐊   or alligators 🐊 in distance: would you still have the same eager to help?? 🤔
Thank God for Mama’s baby boy. He’s a hero. Thank you for the police office who came quickly to the rescue.  They are hero❤🎉
That's the stuff , men ! Good job ! 🍻💫🍻  Good on the young fella finding help under extreme stress !   Good job there , young man ! Very , very good ! ✨️👍✨️ YOU SAVED HER LIFE , buddy !!! That's magic , man !
❤❤❤🎉
Dear father I hope she made it.  That precious boy  bless him.
Cops were so slow lol asking is anyone there while kid was screaming all infomration need before entering the car lol
Always incredible when I see people in the water trying to help. My 15 year old best friend drowned in the car while the cop who ran into her stood on the bank and watched her car go under. Thankful to see anyone go the extra mile to save a life. 😢❤ I hope she was ok.
I don't no about anyone else but I was helping him pull that door open I was like open open please I realy hope the lady survived lucky she had her son with her 🙏❤
That is a real cop in action. It did not matter if the person in trouble was Black or White, but that someone was in desperate need, and he went into action to save a life. That is what being a policeman is all about.  May God continue to bless and protect this officer and others like him.
The cop just standing there the othe men got her out
That is America 🇺🇸,.. ...🙏🏽
Thank God for rescuer❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢
omg i feel his pain, hope she ok.  That is so traumatizing for anyone, but for a small child is unimaginable. I pray for him n his family.❤️🙏🏽
Oh Jesus ❤❤❤
Could he be any  slower
I’m not gonna lie I hate this fucking cop. Everything he did was stupid.
I bet she is so thankful to have such a brave loving son. Blessings 🙌to you and your family. Praying all turned out, ok🙏
Why did the cop take so long! the child said she was in there
The cop took his sweet ass time. That is not the time to walk slowly and ask if anyone is in there… the kid said his mom was in the car when he initially approached. You fucking RUN and you check your dam self and you ask questions AFTER you save her life.
The cop sure did have a lot of questions
This touched my heart ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤😮😮😮😮thank God for this baby boy who knew he had to go get help blessings to him and the others pray that she's doing well 🙏💖💜🤍🧡🌄🕊️ I☔☔☔☔💙👑👑👑👑👑☺️⭐🔥🔥✨🕊️💞
Oh Lord bless them and be with them and all 😂good people in the world.
Thank God that that officer was there to help that young boy was hysterical
This is why you grow up to be a police officer 👮‍♀️ there is no other reason because the pay sucks and ppl suck but you will risk everything to save whoever you can💯 Officer deserves an award!
I pray his mother is doing well! I pray for his well being, my mother had seizures no child wants to see that let alone have this happen We could never compare, this made my heart hurt Im sending a hug to this young man! You are your mother’s hero I know she proud of you!
"Is thur anybody ina thur? Let's have a beer and check in a bit!"
They are still good people in this world thank you Sir!!
Why did  he ask is somebody in there? He took and you "trained officer" Why would did he ask "is the door unlocked?" GO FIND OUT INSTEAD OF ASKING STUPID QUESTIONS!.
The cop was far toooo slow...cmon.... asking if there is somebody in there or if its the car unlocked...wow...thanks to the other guy... that cop should be in an office no field work
Why the f*** did this cop just ask if somebody was in that car?After that kid said his mom was in there🤷‍♂️ he said Help her several times
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This isn't in Florida for sure.  You on your own if you go in a lake in Florida. You better pray the alligators,  crocodiles and giant snakes all ate before you landed in that water or God sealed their mouths. Consider yourself in a Daniel in the loin den situation.
She made it right? 🙏
Pero si vivió acompleten la noticia queda uno en suspenso 😢
💝🙏🏻💝to her full recovery
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❣️🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I thought they are not allowed to drive if they have epilepsy
The chills that covered my body
By the Grace of God!!!
Holy crap that was intense!! 😮
I like how he was hesitating to get wet for most likely black woman 😂
Thank God that baby was in there to get help.She would of died if not..😢
That poor kid.
That poor baby
That cop didn't even want to help how u hear a lil boy screaming for his mom n u jis ask if someone's in there wtf
That sweet baby is a so brave, that happen in Orange TX, only 15 minutes from where I live on the way back from Walmart I seen all the ambulances and cops. I didn't know what happened, but when I watched the news that night I seen it and cried. So sad but great rescue because of him he is a true hero. God bless this little man and his momma and all of the bystanders who acted quickly amen 🙏 ❤
This young boy broke my heart. Trying to get his mother help. Praise to God he got an officer to help get his mother out of the water!
Hate to say it .. things like this make you appreciate your loved ones .
Poor baby boy, he’s so brave and pushed them to hurry and saved his momma ❤❤❤❤
Thank God ! Everyone Has To Have The Window Glass Breaker In the Car ! The Only thing That will Break The Glass ! You cant Open the Door Against The Water.. Pray She's Ok... Thank u Guy's for Helping ! A Bit Slow Though..😬🤔
Dumb Question Bruh Just Jump In And Do something!!!
Poor kiddo just wanted everyone to move faster...his mom was under water
Amen thank God there ok🙏🙏🙏
PUT THE FKN CAMERA DOWN!!!
Poor kid
Awesome to all involved, especially the son. Thank God!
🫶🏻💯🫶🏻 Glory be to all!❤
Oh God! Is she ok???
Wow I guess the cops aren't racist pigs now, huh?
God is good
Everyday heroes. Hope all is well. Anyone with an update?
Broke me all the way down I’m on break at work crying. U feel for him and all of them I pray she made it!!!❤
God bless that little boy for being so brave after witnessing something so frightful, and the officer for being brave.
Thank goodness there is still good people in this world interested in helping others ❤🎉🎉......
I don't understand why is this video on YouTube. I think YouTube is becoming demonic. Let me check with my lawyer.
Why did the cop ask if someone is in there so calmly when the boy just said help my mom?  🤔
That poor baby boy 🥺🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Praying for him and his mother
That cop aint shit!...smh
Is she ok??
I hope 🙏 that his mum okay sweet loving boy xxxx
What a brave little boy. He was calm enough to get the good officers to rescue his mom.
O my God😮😢
Wow
Why will someone with seizures drive. This is very dangerous
GOD BLESS THAT LITTLE BOY AND THE TWO MEN THAT SAVED HER.
Wasting time by asking stupid questions? The boy is scared to death and in shock! What more do you need? 🙄
Bless you, youngester Baby  girl is already telling you.  ❤😊
That boy saved himself!!!! Hes clearly escaped out of the water and went back for help to save his Mom!! Did she survive?
Everyone  was brave in this situation. Whenever  you get in water. You are putting your lif at risk
Stroll up. Then ask redundant question is she in there. Did you not hear the panicked boy. Smh
My question is how the hell did that car end up in the water ??? 😮 Bravo to the child and the first responders who saved her life. 😇🪖🫂🗣️👋❤️‍🩹😎💯👻👾👼😘🚨💯
Cop seriously said is somebody in there? Kids like dude get my mom!!
REALLY??? IS THE CAR UNLOCKED??? MAN..IS SHE IN THERE?? AFTER THE WOMAN & CHILD SAID SHE WAS HAVING A SEIZURE??  I THANK YOU FOR HELPING, BUT THOSE WERE STUPID QUESTIONS AFTER YOU WERE TOLD SEVERAL TIMES SHE WAS IN THERE!! YEA, EMS..STEP IT UP & DON'T ASK STUPID QUESTIONS...THE WOMAN IS IN "WATER"!🙈🙉🙊
My prayers go out to you that lady in her little boy and their family
Praise God she was saved
⚠️STILL, NOT ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION STATING WHETHER OR NOT THE WOMAN SURVIVED?!?! 🧐
That baby boy saved his mommas life after escaping a severe crash into water! I’ve never seen such bravery in someone so young!!! God bless both him and his Momma!
Poor kid, but a brave kid. Well done
Poor baby 💔🥺
Omg that's so scary bless him bless both of them !!!!
Hope his mom makes it out of the hospital. My brother didn't, it turned out be my last remaining vivd memory of him. Being a human icicle on a hospital bed on life support.
I prayed that she survived and is recovering well. I also pray she and her son seek counseling. That was traumatic.
God bless this young man and also the officer and hopefully the young lady made it out in time.
My Mom randomly died twelve days ago, and this just gutted me!
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥👑👑👏🏿👏🏿🙏🏿👏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
THANK God and thanks to the cop and others for saving a life🙏🏽
Thank you Lord God for Children  Saying out of mouth of baby. Thank you for the man that believes in Children and he helped  Show kindness of love ❤ Amen yes,  in the Mighty Name Jesus Amen...❤❤❤
Finally a cop serving and protecting. Even though it's not his own kind.. Cops were never put in place to help a certain kind of people no matter what they tell you.
The kid just said his mom was in there 🙄
BLM says we must defund the police ?
Praise GOD
Good job son  u helped save her life. Glad she is recovering
The dumbest thing this officer said was is anyone in there and the kid told him she was having a dang seizure he keeps asking stupid questions waisted time the lady is have a dang seizure what keep asking stupid questions after this kid tells him what blatantly gonna on
We need to be helpers one to another be bless
Go in there .vs calling out.
Child was so frightened yet so brave to get help God is so good puts his Angels right where we need them 🙏🙏
That's the kind of police we need in every city!❤❤❤
Poor baby😭
This made me cry. Glad she was saved.  🙏🏽
Shes deadd
💔
He looks a lot like the black child from shameless. I thought that’s what it was. God I wish that was the case 😢
Did the mom recover  ?.
Gator: 👀
Thanks cop, for save the mom and the beautiful life of this boy..!!!
Boy: my mom needs help, she sunk, she's in the water  The cop: HELLO IS SOMEBODY IN THERE ?
What a lazy half assed rescue! If youre out of shape, go do paperwork and get off the streets!!! You left her to drown while you slowly pussyfooted to the scene! Breathing all heavy and labored. Ridiculous.
That cop had ZERO sense of urgency
Is somebody in there? 🤔
This baby, my heart goes out for him and thank you officer for doing your job and showing kindness.
He isn't a good Samaritan it is his JOB. Thank God he is a good officer that follows the call
True example of a policeman where he needs to be when he needs to be there, protect and serve good job
He says good samaritan, hmm, no cop is good
I wonder if that was her first ever seizure?  If you have a history of them, then it's very dangerous to drive at all.
Wow!!! I already was on the edge of my seat when he said she was having a seizure, but when he said she sank and the camera panned over to the car lodged in the water head first!!!! I was like OMG!!!😮😮😮
This shocked me. I've never seen cops even try to help someone.  They will probably charge her will resisting because she's out cold and non-compliant.
Thank you
That poor baby is so distraught😭 I pray that his mother is making a recovery.😢
why didn't that police officer go into the water right away, afraid of wet socks, ridiculous, every second counts
Why the cop takes for ever to do his job asking a drowning person is anyone in their??? Wtf??? Hurryyy
The media should show the good cops do for All people in their community. Apparently, it's only nationwide headline news when it's a negative story. Mainstream Media Sucks.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Really the cop asked if the doors where unlocked its in the water sir .i believe so😂😂
Cop ask 20 questions and then id...we need people that care not FAKE LAW INFORCMENT
That young man and police officer are heroes!!!! Hope mommy is doing ok.
Asking multiple times if someone is in the car instead of helping, after the child begs him, is just beyond words..
People who suffers from diseases such as seizures shouldn't be driving. Poor kid.
I guess that cop just didn't want to get wet??.. how many times does someone have too be told directly that theres someone in the car before he stops asking if theres someone in there??!!thank god for the good Samaritan
❤
He asks if the door is unlocked
I'm wondering why she's allowed to drive if she has seizures?
Thank you all who help save the momma
GOOD JOB 👍🏽 young man 🫡, Very Good under pressure 👏🏽👊🏽🇺🇸, GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY 🙏🏽, You are going to Do great things IN LIFE 💗  YOU JUST HAVE 👊🏽🙏🏽 Amen 🙏🏽.
Tears flowing down my face . God bless this cop. God bless this child and his mom. I see no color. I see love and respect ❤
God keep this baby n i speak life n peace over their life! Draw them closer to u oh God n oneanother in jesus name!! Bless those that saved her!!❤❤❤
That lady pays taxes for the police to do stuff like this. Thankfully he upheld his job duties
Thank God the officer save her
What a brave boy!!! I hope mom is okay!!!❤
How did the young man get out of the car?😢
Casually walking up to a submerged vehicle and asking "Is the car unlocked" ..... Mind you this all occured after he stood on the edge of the water yelling "Is she in there?"   I'm not exactly Sherlock Holmes but I'm betting the good Samaritan isn't shoulders deep in water trying to get into the vehicle to save a pet hamster.
God this reminds me of my mom’s seizures 🥺that boy was terrified and probably the same age I was when she got them.. glad she’s okay
Why does he ask if someone is in there when the boy just told him his mom's in there. N why does he walk up, then stand at the bank asking questions. U can tell he was doubting on weather or not to get in there.
Thank God she is ok and thanks for the speedy help
I’m happy the young one survived. I hope he appreciate all the help was given and focus what he have as well as received. As this can be stepping stone to dealing with whatever the outcome was that day.I sincerely hope his mom had the best outcome.
Thank you JESUS AMEN 🙏 🙌 ❤️
Omg I hope they are all ok😢
That cop is a lazy mf ain’t he😂
I remember my mom starting to seize while driving on a few occasions. She always told me not to call an ambulance unless she got hurt real bad. She was terrified they’d take her license, as she was a single working mom with not a lot of options. Thankfully, we never got into a bad accident because she taught me how to pop the car into neutral and let it coast to a stop on the shoulder. It’s definitely scary to a kid though, needing to be the adult in the situation.
Oh that poor baby boy .thank god she's doing well thank god x
Terrifying
this is soo sad to watch.
"Is somebody in there? Come out with your hands up."
😢..
God bless you for saving this baby boys mama
This man deserves all the applause all of your kindness and love this man is a TRUE HERO❤❤❤❤❤❤ and should be acknowledged
S/o to that Good Samaritan!
Boy yelled out helllp herrrr!!!!! I know that’s right
I'm surprised that cop didn't say okay partner you got an ID
That makes you a drive hero. Respect and honor peace be with you.
Bless him and her. This is why you're not suppose to drive it you haven't been stable without seizure actvity for at least 1yr.
The cop was taking his sweet time trying to save the woman’s life, the son said she’s in the car save her and he continued to delay the rescue. He saw the other man in the water trying to save her and he still asked if someone was inside. SMH 🤦‍♂️ cop didn’t care to save a life.
The kid said mom is in there... The cop: somebody in there?...
The way he didn’t go in immediately is wild of course someone’s In there why else would he take you
I hope the boy gets the help he's going to need.😢
THANKS BE TO GOD‼️‼️‼️‼️ AND THANK GOD FOR HER SON‼️‼️‼️‼️ HE SAVED HIS MOTHER'S LIFE❤
The cop was so weird, the boy already said she was in there but he still asking if anyone in there…? How is a person covered in water in a car can answer u????
PRAISETHELORD, for the child, the great Samaritan, and the officer ❤🙏🏽🙌🏽 I was so happy to see Samaritan carrying her😊 Praying she and her son are okay.
God bless all involved who saved that woman and intern saved that little boy
For those saying he was “too slow” and “didn’t want to help because of race”   Shut up. Grow up.   He was assessing the situation. The car was mostly under.  He ran back with a punch to get her out, told EMS to hurry up, and directed the man carrying her.   He then would have started CPR as soon as she was on land.   Give it a break and quit being racist. If nobody’s ever told you, that’s what you’re doing.
Thank God sending 🙏🏽
Thanks for even tyring.
Wow! God had this man there for a reason. Jesus is definitely in control. That’s for your bravery and this little boy is going to need help getting over this. The fear alone can cripple him. Bless them all
Won't see this on the news!!
Thank you Sir for your service 🙏🙏
So sorry for your mom hope she  going to be alright God bless you in Jesus name amen
She made a recovery. She had a seizure while driving.   Be safe out there everyone ❤
The slowest officer ive seen smh
My heart is completely shattered for this young boy. I hope the mum was rescued and they both find healing in Jesus name. Much love and prayers for you🙏♥️
Is somebody in there ??? Go find out! My  mommmm....
Poor charger
The guy is taken too long 😡
Poor little guy😔💔
Did his mother live??????😢
Is it me or was that cop hella slow to get in the water an help? Like how many times you gotta be told their is someone in the damn car. Jump in as soon as you see it an can. Ask questions later 🙏😅
"Is somebody in there"?? He said his MOTHER was in there 🙄
Angel ❤
WAIT HOW DID THE BOY GET OUT N HES DRY
You did AMAZING GETTING MORE HELP FOR YOUR MOM. GOD BLESS YOU ALWAYS AMEN AMEN JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS JESUS
May the Lord Jesus Christ Continue to Bless and protect this lil boy & family always in Jesus mighty powerful name amen amen Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus
Thank God for the bystanders who also took action. So hard to listen to this poor boy in hysterics begging the cop to help his mom.
Shyt the cop could’ve been got her he sitting there asking if someone in there LIKE MF DUH THE BOY JUST FCKING TOLD YOU SHE IN THERE HAVING A SIEZER. Then you wait until someone else comes and do most of the work smmfh THAT COP DID NOT SAVE THIS WOMAN. He left her in there way to long and that’s why she died
Father God thank you thank you for your unconditional LOVE..
All those roads around , and the car is in the pond.
😢😢😢I started crying the moment I saw the little boy. I pray all is well. ❤
The cop shouldn't be a cop he didn't want to get wer
That baby saved her life poor boy in panic.  Thankful that someone was close by too to help out
God bless all of you 🙏🏻 ❤️ ♥️ 🙌 💛 💖 🙏🏻 ❤️ ♥️ 🙌 💛 💖 🙏🏻
The cop seemed a little apprehensive if you ask me
I can't believe the amount of time the lazy cop is wasting asking "is somebody in there?" Those extra 5 seconds he lagged could have cost the woman her life. This is pure incompetence of the part of the officer. The child is literally panicking, and has told him his mother is having a seizure, which means more likely than not she's not in the condition to respond to anyone. Cops should get fired for ish like this
Guy took forever to react tho.
Is somebody in there? Kid: I said my mom and my foot hurt Thank God they were covered
That kid at the beginning of the video begging for help for his mom, ripped my heart out!❤❤❤
Omg!!😢
This is the hand of God Thank God all is well Young man praying for you
🙏🏽❤🙏🏽❤🙏🏽❤
😢😢😢🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
😭😭💔💔💔
So grateful for brave men & women.
What a brave little hero. 🙏 Little man Superman, his love is so apparent, his bravery so real, thank God he still has his Mom. Helping save her life, he's a blessing & wonderful son, he'll love & cherish her more than ever now. And she will him. 🥹🙏 Thank you to the man & 1st responders, we'd be in a heep of bad trouble if it weren't for people like you... Thank you, thank you, thank you. ❤️🙏❤️
God bless these people
Brilliant..in the UK - Police would have to do a risk assessment before getting in, then call the appropriate rescue team for water.    All this technology at yet cars still can't open underwater
Someone sure was taking there time to rescue his mom.
Thank you Jesus.
God bless the men urgently and desperately fighting to save this woman.  God bless this little boy, the men. May we always be the hands and feet of Jesus. Amen
God bless this child, the office and the Man in the water, and the momma.  This was very scary for them all❤. I'm glad she survived.
Break 💔 my heart i hope 🙏🏿 they save her he so long thank to the young man saving his mom
Poor baby... What a determined & loving young man!
Terrified child " shes having a seizure, she sunk, shes in the water, help her"   Cop not wanting to get wet.."is she in there? Is somebody in there?"..casually walks over to car..."is the car unlocked"
God bless them ❤
I thought people who have seizures wasn’t supposed to drive for that reason they can have accidents and put everyone around them I. Danger
Why the hell would she drive a car if she has seizures? You can’t even get a driver’s license. It wasn’t her first because the kid knew exactly what was wrong with her.
Excellent rescue job. What a blessing❤❤
Obviously from what I understood he said his Mom was having a seizure which is probably how they ended up in the water.  Thanks to the son and cops she made it out. I hope she survived.
This dude reaction was like molasses running up hill in winter time....
😢 Why are they moving so slow to rescue her??
I'm in tears that look on that child face for his mom
This is one of my greatest fears and the reason to why I don’t drive at the moment, and why I’ve already explained to my son who is six now when he was younger, what epilepsy was and that godforbid mommy ever “passes out” how to use the emergency call on my cell phone
Thank you, sir when people have seizures they get very sleepy and confused. She would’ve easily drowned.
Well, the cop asked if someone was inside enough times.
A good Samaritan cop wouldn’t have been asking what the kids were already telling him. he would’ve dove into action and went to saving that lady’s life.
He steady sayin is there someone in there while this baby is crying out saying his mom is in there like wtf you thought he was lien
God bless that baby, so brave
Brave little fella
**THANK YOU!!  LORD JESUS CHRIST!!  FOR SAVING HER LIFE!!**
Dude was not taking it seriously enough
That child’s voice and the desperation in it…broke my heart
OMG‼️‼️‼️
Amen
The Cop was so Slow and Even asking of somebody is in there. The Boy told him his mum is in there wtf. He couldn‘t Care less about his mum.
Jesus Christ that’s the slowest fucking cop I ever seen
😢🙏🙏🙏 God Bless
What a son!!!!!!! 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Poor sweet boy 😢 such a terrifying ordeal. Thankfully the civilian got her out and the cop was able to help too.
Why the cop moving slow af....then he wanna pick up speed when he see a man in the water helping
But I thought all cops were bad? That's what mainstream media says and we know they never lie.
That must have been terrifying. Glad she was saved. Side note: That kid has an uncanny resemblance to Liam Gallagher.
Poor child. I pray everyone is okay.
I hope she recovered and little man did great job to find help
Thank God for that baby, the guy already in the water trying to save her, and the Police officer for saving this ladies life. 🥹Her son is a little Hero! This entire situation is very tramatizing for all parties. 😞😞
Who asks chilled questions like these when a child who is soaking wet just told you in hysteria that my mom is in there? Then you even have time to shoot a video🙄 Thanks but no thanks😮
THANK YOU GOD JESUS AMEN 🙏🏽 AMEN 🙏🏽
That cop waited to d@mn long to save her 😒😒 That’s not suspicious at all…
I see my son in this little man and we both epileptic. He was pronounced dead on time and I have had two accidents due to seizures. Never give up.
Does anyone know if the baby made it?
I hope that his mother makes a full recovery... Thank God those policemen were there
"Is she in there, is someone in there?" .... i mean he TOLD YOU his mom is in the damn car!?
That cop sure took his time with a severe medical emergency…
Thank you, Lord for sparing her life. Glory to God! Hallelujah! Amen! 🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
BOY TOLD YOU SIR SHE IN THERE !!!!      THIS COP WOULD HAVE SAID AND DONE DIFFERENT THINGS IF THEY WERE HIS . WHITE RACE.
Hearing that boys exasperated cries for his mom brought tears to my eyes. He did good finding help
Thank you❤
Could the cop be any slower! I see no motivation in trying to save this woman. Seems like he doesn't want to get wet. Despite all the comments about this cop saving the woman. He could have done things a lot better than this. He didn't handle it all that well. Voice sounds as he is irritated.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Omg 😲.  That cop was her guardian angel 😇.  That poor son 😢 had the look of desperation.  Thanks for helping. I'm praying 🙏🏽 she's ok.  I would personally never drive again.
Amen❤
Is somebody in there? lol really? He just gonna wait and say well she didn’t answer! And asking the kids is the door unlocked?? lol what’s wrong with that man? He sure doesn’t wanna have to help. This is a cop??? Knock on her window.  That’ll work. 🙄
Goodblessyou baby
Im hapt they were able to save her. God is good . But she is s danger driving unfortunately  , as a nurse, this can happen anytime, even when you take your medication daily
God bless them all
God Bless this family thank the man who helped them
💔💔💔 OMG!!!!
I don’t know if this is her first time having the seizure, but Mom definitely can’t drive anymore because she’ll be putting her son and her life at risk
The thought that someone behind the wheel of a car out on the public roads could have a seizure while driving is most disturbing!
Jesus please help this little angel have his mother back.Koodo to the two men
Hope she's okay.  (Not that this applies to her ) But- This also stands in The importance of not driving when you have certain medical conditions is so huge.  Normalize communities helping these people get places so they don't risk lives to .
Take your time!
Amazing the comments not taking into account there could be weeds etc. in the water making it hard to wade to the car!
Thank the Lord for Son's,  Amen.
I’m thinking they’re saying help and my foot and he’s saying is anybody in there and is the door unlocked 👀 at a slow pace
🕊️🕊️
That poor baby! He was so brave for his momma!
You're supposed to break the BACK window. Cars are designed to stay sealed and breaking the front or passenger window puts the victim at more risk.  Use the back window!

😭🙏❤️
How did she make out!!! Anyone know? I’m scared for mom and son😢😢❤❤
The child said and articulated it very clear:   She’s having a seizure  She sunk…. Police gets there and yells to the direction of the car: ‘Is anyone in there’ a couple times while the child is stating that ‘she’s in there’  She’s having a seizure!!!! She may be passed out… can’t reply if you’re unconscious or if your head is under water…  Just get in there! Wasting precious seconds! 😤😡😡
🥹🙏🏾❤️
The krazy part is that the little boy kept saying my mom is in there help her
Thank God!!
May YAHUAH heal her in YAHUSHUA NAME ❤❤
This kid is a hero, getting help for his Mom, hopefully she is doing well. Thanks for the good Samaritans that helped. Angeles among us. God bless this child.🙏😥
I know he wants to learn how to drive now. Because I’m sickly I taught my kids young young just in case.
that cop didn't seem to rush to save the lady, considering the son said help her. seemed pretty nonchalant
Boys desperately tells cop there’s a serious emergency 🚨 where time is of the essence, cop shows up “ anybody in there? Laid back as car is almost under water, anybody in there answer me before I come check!! 😮 wtf
😢❤
JESUS....THANK GOD FOR THIS YOUNG MAN SEEKING HELP FOR HIS MOM AND HER 3 GUARDIAN ANGELS FOR SAVING HER LIFE.... HER SON, THE SECOND GUARDIAN ANGEL ALREADY THERE, AND THE COP, HER THIRD GUARDIAN ANGEL, REFUSING TO GIVE UP UNTIL HIS POINTED CHARGE WAS OUT AND SAFE... BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.....     ......AND THE FACT THAT NEITHER OF THOS WOMAN'S GUARDIAN ANGELS THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT GETTING IN THAT WATER AND RESCUING HER.... MY GOD.....
Dios está presente al momento de mandar personas para auxiliar. En situaciones difíciles y angustiosas. ❤❤
❤🙏🏻
Il est pas rapide le mec
The trunk of the car was outside still why the heck he wasting time trying to open the door when he could have get through the trunk easier
Bless that baby’s heart witnessing something like that. He’s going to need some healing. Thank god for these officers and Samaritan.
That cop was lame as F
My worst nightmare Scenario this is one of my reasons why my fear of riding in a car my father almost drowned in a water car accident like this one he worked overtime and fell asleep on the wheel and it was snowing that day skids off the road into a lake almost the whole car submerged under water if it wasn't for a good Samaritan helping keeping my dad's face above water until rescue came he would've had died a cars nowadays are smaller and tighter being in a Scenario like this one it's harder to escape from a watery grave the smaller the vehicle is the more scary it is for me to get in
The child is so worried and telling them she in there and they asking stupid questions always wasting time...then lamenting bad outcomes
Wie kann sowas passieren????
His cries😭😭😭
The cop didn't want 2 help !!!
I hope she's ok, I thought people with seizures cannot drive 😱
That first man questioning the boy seemed to delay too much. Like, "is anyone in there?" You would think by the child's response and statements the man would have reacted with more urgency.
The fact that he had to ask six different times is someone in there while they're trying to rescue her is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life
I PRAY THEY ALL ARE OK❤🙏🏿
Thank you to the man that actually saved her cuz this cop wasn't acting like he gave any fks
Wow. That cop had ZERO empathy and zero urgency.  Probably too FAT to help anyone.
God could he have walked any slower ffs🤯 it was that other man that saved her life.
He asked too many questions for me. He said his mother was in there. Why are you still asking? Smh
That poor baby! 😔
Question:  what's hoe?  It used to be that it was a woman who was sexually active with multiple men at once on a casual basis.  But what is a hoe now-a-days?  I feel a woman's "body count" is nobody's business especially if she's been in relationships.
Thank GOD for everyone involved for everything that they all worked together to save her life. ❤
Damn that’s crazy. How did he get out of the car.??
The two men had a better reaction time than the cop. Go figure
Poor kid
Though he said Hop in got me
That cop was almost useless. Dang.. could he have moved any slower or been less empathetic?
Cop was scared af lol
Oh no!!!! The desperate cry of this baby tore me to pieces. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Thank GOD help came right on time.
He told the cop she was in the car he kept asking the same question. Help the woman
Thats heartbreaking
They didn't even try. And they put the boy in the back seat like a criminal.  He's screaming for his momma. Their asking is anyone in there like she can answer, then they ask if the car is unlocked. You can Herr her banging on the glass, while they take their time. Then you see a lifeless body pulled out.
So happy for brave caring human beings like these men!❤
I hope the kid isn't permanently traumatized by that experience. He did everything he could do and did a great job helping to save his mom
Shitty cop. Was he really asking is somebody in there ? After the kid told him my moms in there lol
So proud for this young man!  He was witnessing something absolutely terrifying happening to his Mama and jumped in the help her immediately!  That takes a tremendous amount of bravery!  Mama, you are raising this young man to be a very strong and responsible adult and he will go far in life!  I pray healing and peace over your family!  In Jesus’ Holy and Mighty name, AMEN!  ❤️🙏🏻♾️🕊️🌹
Good samaritan???  That's her son for crying out loud..
Shorty acted fast. GOD BLESS   HIS AND MOM
Child crying set me off before seeing vid, desperation in voice. Hope all worked out well. ,🌹
Took his Time “is somebody in there” no shit 😂 kid just said that “she’s in the water” while being soaking wet
That little boy and those officers and the good Samaritan are true heroes
We are not moving fast enough for this emergency 😤
Why do people post these life and death situations and not give the full story! Don’t post things you can’t corroborate!
People with epilepsy and prone to seizures shouldnt be allowed to drive
Why is she even driving thats against police and doctor orders
Where is the Police
There was no urgency on the police end. He was supposed to immediately jump and dive in the water to save that woman
Thank God Mom is allright. Lil man will never forget this day and will need counseling because as an adult watching this clip caused my pressure to rise and my heart to sink to my stomach. Praying for this Mother and Son.
They all should be awarded for their bravery. Especially her sweet son
If it was a white boy would he have already had the "punch " in his hand ... Obviously she was in there ...
She'll probably never get her license back. Hopefully this was a new thing and there's not a negligent doctor out there. (If you have seizures, it's the doctor's job to have any vehicle license you get suspended for medical reasons.)
He took forever to get to the car because he doesn't care at all 😂
Thank God for sending help❤
🙏🙏🙏❤❤
Thank God for her son and 2 men that saved her
I read later in the comments the mother was in the ICU and later recovered at least taken off the ventilator.. so that’s good news and I’ll take it .. thank you Jesus
Bet this will not be national news
Omg his momma i hope they saved her❤
That poor child was so brave and the one in the water trying to help. Why did the cop ask if anyone’s in there when he just been told she was in the car ?
This is 99.99% of cops....the other blend in when they defend that .1%....now, they're all crooked
I hope she never ever gets behind the wheel of a vehicle. Be blessed 😢
Precious boy😍
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Did she survive?
Oh bless his heart, poor baby!!!!!. I hurt for me🙏🏽
Wow... Hero's.. thank you for showing there are good humans out there. Good Job son as well!
God  sent angels his way! ❤❤
“Is somebody in there?” No officer the car magically got in there, she crawled out while having a seizure and is now in the grass some where convulsing… sometimes I swear to a god I don’t believe in that cops as the stupidest shit
A mother and her baby boy is an unbreakable bond. I'm 61 and my mother is 81 and she still says "there's my baby boy" when she sees me! God bless this mother and son!
How do you accidentally drive into a lake?
Bravo!!!❤❤❤
Did she live ??
Bless him hopefully is mum is ok he's traumatized poor boy 😢😢❤
That boy is a true hero❤
How many times does the boy have to say his mama is in that car? The cop just stood there like "is anyone in there"
How did the boy get out
God bless❤our 1st responders❤
I mean we have to be thankful she didn’t have a seizure and drive into oncoming traffic and potentially kill other drivers.
Thanks too the 3 people for helping the mom out that water ❤
This is what police are supposed to do, protect, and serve. A special thanks to the man already in the water. The three of them saved her life.
Did this mother survive for God sakes?
He told s him she's in the water  but he asked again 😮❤ 😂 😢
Poor baby girl was so terrified my heart broke for her.  I hope her mother was saved.  God bless this baby girl.
Prayers. There still are great people in the world
HE TOLD YOU SHES IN THE WATER. MOVE OUT THE WAY IF YOUR SCARED TO GO IN
Ohhhh.   Very alert boy.  Police is such a savior.   Blessings ❤❤❤ He is a hero.    Than̈k God for a happy ending.
Bro took forever like wtf hurry tf up
Good job lil dude you’re gonna remember this forever
Omg. 😢
😭😭😭😭
"IS SOMEONE IN THERE!!!!"... Really dude?? I can hear her clearly.. That tone in your voice sounds too aggressive 😢 and worrisome!! Thank god for body cams!!
😭😭😭 him crying for his mom   I’m so glad she’s recovering
Thank y’all
Omg that child’s look of desperation broke my heart
Thank you, Father, for these brave souls. Thank you for keeping the woman once again.
Asking them dumb ass questions,less talking more action
Cops voice showed he really wasn’t interested in saving anyone.  But he helped
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
'Cmon hop in' I love those good old boys. They never panic
This is a true miracle from God. All who  saved this woman is a gift from God.  Blessings to humanity.  This is why racism must end because we were meant to love and to help each other don't know all who saved this woman, but I love them from the heart.  African American woman N.J VEIWER.  Blessings to humanity we gotta end this fear and MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF ONE ANOTHER.❤
Dang she was having a seizure..😢
What a good kid! Sweetheart!♡♡♡
How did she get in there ???????
God bless you great job
It’s sad because you can clearly hear the child. Say she’s having a seizure. She’s in the water helper and yet the cops still ask if anyone is in there and then the pedestrian has to come and try to save her before the cop even gets in. It’s almost as if he wanted her to die. This is so sad.
Thank you God
Good samaritine are real israelite
Bless his heart
What a smart, loving and brave kiddo!!! Being calm enough to get himself out and get help for his mom. My prayers are with this family, I pray mom survived and will make a full recovery. After she's recovered show her how brave her son was and what am amazing job she has done raising him to be able to function in a time of need like this!!!
"Is she in there?" The dangon child just pointed & said she was having a seizure. Sheesh!!
God bless 🙌 🙏
His desperate voice broke my heart. Thank God rescuers were able to save her 🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏
But God!!
Some cops run. Some cops walk. This dude was slow.
Thank God they were able to get her out. Any updates? That’s so scary for him and us watching. 😩
How did they get there in the first place 😳!?
Heros all three! Heaven has a special place for you!
God bless you sir
Thank God for a brave son and a good Cop. So gladthis sorry ended well.
Poor boy, he’s panicking so much for he feels helpless but his screaming for help hasn’t fallen on death ears. Thank God!
Just get out 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Those poor kids. How terrified and devastated they sound. I hope mom got out ok and got help for her seisures.
Happy to hear Mom is slowly getting better. 🙏🙏 How did the car get in that water?
Dios propicie grandeza y Prsperidad en Salud a su vida q mentalmente este bien igual al niño ..much Paz y Armonía esos angeles d Luz bendiciones infinitas🌹👏
I live in west orange.  What body of water is this.? I need a back story. 😮
Comments are great but does no one pick up in the fact that this officer allowed the young baby to be in the water and he could have drowned. Smh and he pulling on this bloody handle like if he does it enough it would open - you have equipment to smash the window , there seemed to be a lack of urgency on his part and a lack of empathy , where’s the footage asking for further assistance - or did he not bother. Probably thought she was drunk driving. I hope she is alive as it looked like she was gone
Cop is a bitch..asking questions already answered by the kids struggle
You see, you have Good Police Officers 👮 👮
Lord thank you for that child presence 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Those poor babies 😭😭😭  Heartbreaking
Praise God 🙏🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Poor baby.. 😢
That child's pleas. 😣 Oh my heart just broke for him. I hope to God that doesn't affect him the rest of his life! Thank that Officer & thank God that his momma got out . What a brave lil man. God protect his heart, mind, body and soul Lord, in your precious name. Thank you Jesus 🙌🏼❤️‍🩹
Omg poor baby
This made me cry😢. Many blessings to that baby for trying to get help to save his mother🙏
God bless them all 🙌 Plz lord help them heal what we don't know about in everyway 🙏
Bless that little boy   He was so scared..
Did she survive
If people who are known To have seizures , as the boy seems to be aware that seizures have happened before ,weren’t permitted to drive as they shouldn’t be this could have been avoided
At least the cop is actually doing something good. Grateful to this officer for trying to help. I pray that lady is okay.
His screaming really cut deep. I can’t fucking imagine how terrifying of a sight that is to see. Jesus Christ. I hope he’s doing alright. Along with the mother obviously, saw a comment saying she’s finally off the ventilator in the ICU. The cop and other person and or people there saving her are real heroes
Omg
The Young Son is So Worried.
I've seen a few of these scenarios. Cops are trained to stand there, say stupid things and wait for a real hero, like a normal person to jump in and save people before a cop would even ponder doing so, but then will to take all the credit   "Is somebody in there"? 🤔 No, the child in absolute fear of their Mom dying of drowning while having a seizure was a joke you ninkomooop
Did she live
I feel so bas that the little dude had to go through that traumatizing situation. I hope he and the mom are alright. And thank you to the people that helped them out
Please let us know how mom is doing. Tell her what a little hero her son is!!!!!
How could she not see the lake?  I get it that someone with a truck could have pushed her in the lake. There are a lot of trucks in Texas being driven by big ego'd texans. I supposed she could have fallen asleep or texting, but you have a lake in front of you.
Blessings 💖
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Those men saved her life GOD BLESS THEM❤❤❤❤
God is always on time amen amen 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Poor kid 😢
The little boy done told him his mom in there but he yelling is someone in there too many life's gone because of slow ass like that
This cop sucks
Wtf you asking if someone is on there , the child said someone was in there when he ran up to you.
Stupid to stand there and say is somebody in there
The cop asked if someone's in the car after the child told him that his mom IS IN THE CAR.
How did he know she was having a seizure? If she has them I wonder why she’s driving 😢
That sweet little boy and the other two are all heroes…❤
This is terrifying 😢
Good job youngin the other guy and the officer and thank you sir❤
Oh my heart! This young man’s cried for help for his Mama are heartbreaking! He was so brave and did what he needed in order to save her life! God Bless all of them!! ❤❤
Omg thank God for those good people 🌸💕🌸
Then wants ems to hurry up.
God bless🙏🏽
Slow movements by the cop
🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
God please continue to Bless these wonderful hero’s that saved this woman … also bless this lil boy and his mother .. he’s a brave lil guy !! ✝️🙏🏽🔥
This would not have happened if the person that had the seizure was not issued a license, your putting more than your own safety at risk
Kid asking to help her "she's in the water" Cop "is somebody in there?" How stupid are cops?
Momma still in the hospital but will make full recovery .
🥺🥺😢😢❤️
But we should defund and abolish police, right?? Then how would this and so many other situations go??
That cop sure took his time.
OMG, diese Angst in seinen Augen. Es bricht mir das Herz
Propaganda ain't no such thing as a good cop
May God bless them all for going up and aboard to help this child save his mother,I will salute each of them.❤❤❤❤
He’s saying she’s having a seizure, implying he knows she has a seizure disorder.  She should not have been driving in the first place.  Poor kid.
Oooh jesus
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Useless cop. Slow and dull minded.
It's probably to early in the morning for me to watch this, I have spent the last 5 minutes crying, I just dropped off my 6 year old son at his first day of school. 😭😭😭 I just want to go pick him up and hug him,  But above all of my own feelings I just want to hug that little boy who absolutely loves his mother ❤️
All you cowardly cop haters out there, think again...
😢
Any updates??,
You never know what the day will bring.  God bless this child and all that saved her.  🙏🏿  🙏🏿My father had horrible night seizures and died when I was 15.  I really pushed those unpleasant memories completely out of my mind for 60 years and have just started to recall them now that I'm 75 yoa.
I didn't see him hesitate, he went right in that water but was attempting to secure the young boy first.   Prayers for the boy this is going to change his life forever. 🙏🏽💜
Lord have mercy🙏🏾💞🙏🏾
Not all cops are bad . Remember that folks. ❤
Thank you for saving a soul.
Bless his precious heart. I can't imagine how scared he was. You did great little man. You got help and saved your mom. Im so sorry you had to endure such a hard situation. I truly hope your mom and you are alright. ❤ Much love and many blessings sent to both of you.
That poor kid! He was terrified. But he did everything he could to help his mom. ❤
Omg
My LORD 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🫂👏🏽👏🏽🥲
Jesus!
Cop is missing sense of urgency. Must be from texas
The cop was all slow and shitz. Wtf
That cop was USELESS.
Thank you officer God bless you and your family❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤😮😮😮😮😮 thank God ❤❤❤ the officer was around God bless the family
Thank you for your kind deed.  May God bless you continually….🙏🏻🙏🏻😇👑💕👏
" is somebody in there?"  Hey dumb cop,  the frantic soaking wet child JUST TOLD YOU his mom had a seizure and their car went in the water!!!  🤬
Why is he asking if somebody’s in there when they’re supposedly sunk
The cop really stood and asked is somebody in there like she gone respond. Seriously use your head officer
God bless our police, staying calm for this little boy ..  And rescuing his mother ...  Respect !
“Is someone in there?” 🤔 Glad your humanity stepped in!
What you mean is somebody in there he already told you she was.
I’ve had nightmares about this…this is so traumatic. Please help these people. They are going to have nightmares.
Brave kid! That officer was asking too many questions. Is the car unlocked?? I saw a comment that she was in recovery ❤
It's only a question...Should people who knowingly have been diagnosed with "Seizures" be on the road driving? Should she have had a trained dog in there with her at all times? How can we prevent something like this from happening again? Is there any real help or education for persons with seizures who have no other choice of getting around but driving? People with this diagnosis have a very hard time getting on "Disability" despite medical diagnosis. What's your opinion or factual knowledge?
omg this broke me .. smart kid .. & to whoever that samaritan was thank you for saving her & pulling her & carrying her out of the water .. this officer needs to step it up .. what does he mean “tell EMS to step it up” he didn’t even try to do anything .. unless theres a full vid on this somewhere 🤷‍♀️ & we’re only seeing bits of this 🤷‍♀️ .. Hope the mom is ok now
That officer sucked. He seen the car in the water. Get ya ass in the water! Help!
Cop is useless, wtf did he do besides play with the punch on the side of the car. Moved so slow, standing there asking if someone is inside then goes and taps on the window with a punch haha, not in any kind of hurry.
Dang listening to the child in eat
Sounded like a GTA side quest "come on hop in" 😂
❤❤❤❤ase
Thank god for that office god bless him put his life on the line to save others
🤯😭😭😭😭... thank you Jesus.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
He’s asking is somebody in there? I mean is the car going to drive itself. So the kid just appeared out of nowhere.
How dumb was this cop to see a car turned over & a kid clearly telling you what’s going on… & the cop still asks if anyone is in there!? WTF!!!?
Could the cop move any slower and care any less? Bet if ut was a white kid he would've moved 100xs faster.
Oh, thank GOD the officers believed him to help!  I hope his mother will be alright.  BLESSING BE TO GOD, AMEN
Why ask if someone is in there? The kid literally told him more than once his mom is in there.
That's poor, baby is so scared. What a brave guy. I pray they are ok!!!!
HE SON DID A GREAT JOB..BLESS HIM❣️
What a great kid. God bless him and his family. I hope his Mama was ok.
That poor child desperate to save his mother. When he says "she's in the -----" and can't get the word "water" out of his mouth the right way,you know it's serious immediately. She's in the water submerged halfway. It's serious regardless. The car is 2/3 of the way under the water. I pray that she is okay.
God send  A Angel in a Form of a Police trust them😂
I pray healing for the boy and mum
Aaking if theres someone in there..the fucken kid said there was dumb dumb
How frightening for that young boy. Thank you to those who responded quickly and helped her.
He was so nonchalant .he kept p asking , if someone was  In there , when that little boy said His mama having a seizure drowning  in the car. I’m just so annoyed with his reaction about this situation .but I am glad that both of them are doing well.
The liberal , fake media . Would never show this .
Asking is there anyone in there and is the car locked get a real badge smh🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Why are humans that are known to have seizures even permitted to drive? They may as well be black-out drunk! What an upside down -- inside out society. WTH 😂
Should people who have seizure disorders be driving??!
God is good all the time amen and amen.
Did she live?
Why do people who have seizures drive? My friend in New York die in a car crashed in Florida the same way thank God her daughter survive. One woman killed six in Los Angeles. Why are these people so selfish?
Great job from police and the boy getting help. God had angels there. God Bless you all ❤
Poor kid, he did brilliant 👏 great man for rescuing the mama.
Bless them for helping this child and saving her life ❤🙏🏽❤️
Goodness 😮 what a terrifying moment for the kid! I am glad she is ok 🙏🏼
Thank you officer! Thank you to everyone who helped save her!😓
Is somebody is there?   Yes, barney fife. From the son who flagged you down, to the sister at the scene saying MY MOM. HELP HER.
cop:Is somebody in there ???
A very moving rescue.
It didn't sound like the cop wanted to get in the water
Scary scenario because my next thought was…alligators! Great work and courage by all involved.
This poor angel. I hope to God she made. This breaks my heart.
Seizures are no joke. People who have seizures are always at risk. Keeping them safe is a full time job. Hope this lady was saved.❣️
Good officer's bless them
In tears for this baby. I lost my mom at 17 due to poor medical care by the VA and she served 23 yrs in the army,( Black women never get adequate care anywhere) and they never treated her with proper care. It's heartbreaking. Loosing mom is horrible, but losing Mommy is life changing 😢 😔
For people that hate the police, think again, these people are saving people from the bad things, and the bad people in this world!! I have great respect for the police force !!! ❤
Poor baby he wanted to save his mom this really got to me 😢😢
Poor baby. God bless him and his siblings.
😢😢😢
Dear God, please help this young man and his mother. Please bless her with a speedy recovery and a new safe comfortable way to get a round to the places they need to go. Dear God please provide for their needs. Bless they with joy and happiness. Bless this young man to grow strong and smart. In Jesus name I pray your will be done Amen.
"Is somebody in there"? Jump in and find out rain man.
This is a mom that TAUGHT her child that COPS are good, you can trust a Cop , if you ever need help run to an Officer. Great job to both her son , his mom and her rescuers! ❤❤❤
They barely wanted to help...🙄
What a dumb ass opening it like the water pressure ain’t there
Question number one: how does he know it’s a seizure? Number two: if mom has seizures often what is she doing behind the wheel?
Driving with seizures
Oh Lord! Please dear Father, heal this little boy traumatic episode from he’s memory and allow him to enjoy life with his momma who’s alive thanks to him! Because he called out for help she’s alive. Bless Dear Father Lord he’s heart and he’s mother’s health as well.
I hope and pray that the mom is okay! Her son was so brave to go for help!
Horrible
He told you someone is in their
CNN won't show you this good deed
This made me cry, that poor chikd
Thank you lord for saving that lady,
Cuori d'oro 💛
Bless this kids heart, his mom and all of those. ✝️
Poor kid! God Bless you Little Brother!!🙏♥️♥️♥️
Moving at post office speeds
Jesus they really showed that kids guttural calls for his mother this video was triggering as hell
May The Most High Bless Them All 🙏🏾🙏🏾
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
🙏❤️🌹
Cop in no rush like.
More needs to be done to make windows and doors be opened in these situations by manufacturers.toughened glass and electric doors dont open and public awareness raised. Precious lives are at stake.
Is there a positive update on this lady? Bless little man fir asking for help! X
Poor baby 😢 You can hear the desperation in his voice. Smart, brave young boy
Wtf he asking so many questions 4
That baby saved his mama! God Bless them all
That car sank so fast. The cop and man are heros. They communicated under water to get woman out of car. Boy informed about seizure
"Is somebody in the car?" 🤡
Calling a cop a "Good Samaritan" for doing his job is not it. The kid and man in the car are the braver ones.
This is why I never learned how to drive. It terrifies me that my epilepsy might cause other's pain.
Thank you to the officer, the child & the other people! Tremendous job!!
😢😢 is poor little boy God bless his little heart ❤️ desperate cries for his mother.. I hope she's all right in the name of Jesus😢😢
If she has seizures what is she doing driving?!! And apparently it's not the first time because that child KNEW what was happening. SMH.
God intervened through people.  God Speed.  The young son my ❤ hurt watching him in devastating pain.
Thank you for your service sir god bless you all ❤️
😢
"is she in there?" Naw we just out here pryin open submerged doors for fun. Tf u think?
That baby cries  hurt my heart so bad ❤😢
The urgency of the help was lacking, Big Time!
🙏🏼
I can’t stop crying my heart aches for this baby , to have experience such devastation I pray all is well with his mom and thank God for the bystander and the officer
😳is she in there😳 is somebody in there the little boy  said  she is in there wow! I hope everyone is well
Amen👏👏👏🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❣️❣️

Winbush is recovering in a hospital and after more than three weeks on a ventilator, Holman told ABC News her sister is now breathing on her own and getting stronger.  Holman and her family said they're grateful for the quick-thinking rescuers who didn't hesitate to help.  "My sister and my niece and nephew, they all needed you. Y'all stepped in. Y'all didn't hesitate," Holman said.
Thank God for great people 🙏
Ppl with seizures shoulnt be drivers cars, she could have killed an innoce t person
Here is ANOTHER video that stops at the right time that leaves you guessing and wondering what happened!! SMDH!!
😢Is she ok does anyone know? ❤❤❤❤😢
THE MUM WAS RESCUED, BY A GOOD SAMARITAN & THE COP. SHE WAS UNRESPONSIVE & THE COP DID CPR UNTIL HER PULSE RETURNED. THANKFULLY ALL ARE GOING OK.
To the person that replied , " after digging you found out she was okay" thank you thank you. I was wondering. And couldn't find out anything. Appreciate you... people always seem to tell the bad. But never the good. Thank you
Thank you officers.
That POS cop should lose his job. He didn’t want to help that lady, if that other guy wasn’t there she definitely would’ve died. No thanks to that cop. The whole vibe I got is, he didn’t want to get wet. That little boy was telling the cop over and over again, his mom was in the car so why is the cop wasting crucial time by asking if someone is in the car. When clearly the mom was in the car. He needs to be fired immediately. He clearly doesn’t serve and protect. He serves his own interests and protects nothing but himself.  Really makes me wonder if that boy was white, would the cop be asking questions wasting valuable time AND Would the cop have gotten in the water faster compared to how he treated this black family.😮😮😮
I sure hope she's ok 😢
God is good at all times and bless the people that help them
God bless the young boy. He was so tensed 😢
Think God for that kid running fast for mom didn't go down too glad the guy save mom ❤ hope mom made it since it didn't show it
The cop couldn't have cared any less.... tf why did he take so long
Poor kid omg
I have seizures, too and often lose consciousness. Been in and out of the hospital 9 times this year and got home on Tuesday.  I broke two teeth , my arm, the left side of my face is swollen to three times its normal size. Iremember the cries of my youngest two daughters trying to help me up.😢 I hope she gets better and the baby is okay.
That cop took his sweet time didn’t want to save that woman asking the car if someone in there when that boy was already crying for help telling the cop his mom in their having a seizure smh
Is the mom ok?
It seemed like he almost wasnt going to.
That cop was hesitating took his sweet time his no hero and there was a man that jumped first and started rescuing her….
He went in the water a boy and came out of the water a MAN! 👍🏼
Seeing this child anguish and his face reflecting pain, feeling powerless to get her out by himself, thinking quicly to get help, begging a cop to help save his mama.......  All of those emotions and experience has made this child grow up fast!!  He will be fearful when his mom goes out driving byherself.  I wonder about him and his mom, I wonder if she is a single mom, does he has siblings?   😢😢 May the Lord Bless them all!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏
This Young Man Was So Brave Getting Help For His Momma I Am Praying She Got Out in Time
Good job, bless u all
Thanks
Boat
Cop was pretty useless wasting time
Officer DIDN'T HELP TO ME. ASKING IF SHE IN THERE, WHEN IT'S CLEAR THE LITTLE BOY IS PANICKED AND CRYING STATING HIS MOM IS STUCK IN THE CAR. AND HE EVEN SAID HELP HER!  WTF
Dude! The kid just said his mother sunk! Yes! Someone is in there!
The color of skin has nothing to do with any of this shit.
Juss watching this got me n tears....dat poor babi n his MomIm so glad they were able 2 get her out ...its still some Good ppl n diz world...❤
Jesus 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 have mercy on us
Very brave kid ❤
The cop and his slow response what the heck is somebody in there? Response: 1 year later?!!!!
The panic and fear on that young fellas face killed me! The emotion he must have been feeling!! But good job lil man, your mom is ok because of you!!
This is humanity and its beautiful. ❤
Do cops have a tool that breaks down windows in case of an emergency?
That kid's fear & concern is so heartbreaking.  You can feel his pain.
Thank God for everyone who worked together to save her.
Hurry man.😥.Sending Comfort🫂 and Healing❤️‍🩹 Prayers ✨️🙏🌿
Is the case unlocked? I'm confused... why did he ask that?
Thanks for your beliefs and Grace to get her out of there😢😅
Yes someone is in there!! Jeez, get moving and help her.
That POOR little guy, so afraid for his Mama!!! This will definitely leave a mark on him, he'll NEVER forget the trauma of this situation. I hope they BOTH make a Full recovery!!! ❤❤
Poor baby, absolute desperation and fear for his mom.
Cop didn't do anything
The cop seriously asking if somebody is in there .....
Sounds like she made a full recovery😊
Wow
God Bless her son he broke my heart, he saved her by getting someone there in time. God Bless the first responders
Why is she driving if she has seziures  .. they should have taken her license. No child should go through this
There was someone before the cop helping the mother. Thank you for your kindness and compassion 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
God bless them all !
Thank goodness the child was there and able to get help before it was too late.
Frantic child:My mom's in there she had a seizure she sunk Cop:Is somebody in there?
Bless you sir❤❤❤
That’s southeast texas orange tx.
That little boy is so brave ❤
Poor boy 😢 broke my heart to hear him 💔
Poor baby
aww 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I thought the officer was telling at the man in the water to see if someone was atill in there. Who knows how much time had lapsed between the accident and the officer reaching the scene.
❤❤❤❤
Cop didnt want to get wet.
Is the car unlocked?
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Good work men thank you
God bless all of you not mums time 🙏 praise God for your son ❤
😢😢
Did she survive
she knows she’s not powda be drivin’ she don ha NO license wit dat condition
Thank God to all who were involved in saving her. 🙏🙏♥️
This baby is this mama's hero. The cop was in no hurry getting her out of the water.
Poor kid he’s so scare 🥺
💝😢🙏🏽 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
They are played a part in rescuing his mom
God bless America! I sure hope every one the car is okay.
I hope they both are doing well. May Allah bless them. What a brave young man. ☝🏼🤲🏼🇲🇽
God I pray for full recovery!!❤❤❤ Bless those three for all there help Amen!!!❤❤❤
She shouldn't be driving  if she has seiz
No urgency at all from the police.  So sad
He told you there was a woman in the water. Why would you ask that when you got there?That's pretty dumb
Oh thank GOD,❤ the LORD GOD blessed those people to be there to help this woman. Thank you LORD JESUS, I praise you FATHER Halleluyah. The little boy have his mother,  thank you LORD. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤
What a blessing someone was there at that time to help. God is good. I'm praying for full recovery for hiis mother.
And I thought cops only arrested or shot black people. Wow, I guess the media was wrong.
In an urgency you move quick ! The cop was dragging his feet !
Ya well maybe she shouldn’t be driving then
Why would any adult drive child when they have seizures?
I could not imagine the fear that poor boy felt. But he is so brave, and should be proud of himself. He saved his momma!
Thanks I needed to see this now I'm convinced that there is still goodness and love and compassion n this ol trifflen evil world and God bless that kid u could c the fear and agony  n his face please Lord help him with the memories of this let him remember that 2 complete strangers stopped 2 help and much respect 2 those unnamed heros thank you
I’m so glad this brave little boy was able to get out of the car to help his mom he knew he had too❤❤❤🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 ❤
I was waiting in a parking lot back in 2003 and I heard screaming from the car next to me. It was a bunch of children whose mother was having a seizure in the driver’s seat of the car next to me. Thankfully my boss left his phone in the truck when he went inside and I was able to call 911. Later in life my first child dealt with seizures as a toddler. To this day it still bothers me thinking about it. Definitely the scariest thing I’ve ever seen.
OMG this is hard to watch he looks like my Godson. What a good boy. So happy his mom has a hero.
Why aren't you hurrying?!! Don't ask questions....just jump in and save them. And I feel so sorry for that little boy. Poor baby. He's trying to help the best he can.😢😢😢 I pray they all are okay. 🙏🙏🙏
👮👮👮🕵️
What a sweetheart. I am so glad they were able to save his Mama.❤❤❤
Ohmygosh 😮😢 thank you fir helping 🫶💫♥️✨🙏🙏🙏🙏
Why was the cop not running into the water....geez these public servants I swear
I wonder does she have a history of seizures, if so, she may have been abandoned from driving. Feel sorry for this family 😢🙏🏾
Pos cop lazy fk didn't want to het wet
So happy the mother is off the ventilator and recovering. How many times did that darn cop need to be told she was in the car, needing help?! Thank you to the other man who rescued her. God bless her and her son.
Poor baby.
So the cop was asking (after the boy told him) Is somebody in there?
I gotta get off the internet....oh my  anxiety.
😂😂
How scary for this little guy.
The police officer was so slow by helping, like he was buried. 🤨
There really is good people still on this earth 🌎 ❤❤❤😊
God bless police officer's and first responders in Jesus Name.
Let’s ask 20 questions & take our time rescuing this woman..
Blesssss this little boy 🥰 What a hero🙌🏽🥰🙌🏽
Thank you I salute this supercop mission accomplished! Congrats!. To the rescue victim,God Bless !
Lord Help!!!..Poor Baby!!!...Sounds like Baby Boy said She is having a Seizure 😢...I pray She Made it 😢 ❤. Prayers Lifted For The Mom & Son.
Now that's a police officer.
Thanking God she wasn’t alone and got help and same time omg you driving and have seizures… mercy
Poor kid was sick with worry.  God bless him. I hope he gets swimming lessons to build his confidence.
God bless you man you are a very good human being at the right place at the right time. I hope she’s OK.
Sucks that ones degree of bravery can be discretionary.
The coo was useless asking dumb questions wasting time. Clearly there is someone in there  jackrabbit
So did the Mother survive?
Mom DUI caused it.
Poor little boy!
This is the kind of video I like youtube. Tell your Ai to stop sending me punking video's.
White cop  didn't seemed to be in a rush to help out black woman drowning
Dudes reaction to rescue is so slow and ignorant smh
😭
wtf did the cop do other then shout if someone was in the water and offer the other person equipment to get the lady out.
Hope she's ok. Seizures are scary to happen while driving if she doesn't drive no more I fully overstand
Godblesss🙏🙏🙏🙏
Woooooow!!!!😢😢😢😢
Happy he helped save her but lord have mercy  really do you hear your questions after you've been told what help is needed.??!!! How many times did the kid need to say help b4 you get unstuck from duh!?? Stupid is as stupid says & does as she's drowning while you are questioning a distraught child.  I can't believe sine people
The cop still pissed me off with how slow he was going
The lack of urgency…. Thank goodness everyone is ok.
Right place in the right Time...... Thank you for saving there lives ❤
This little boys desperation to save his mom broke me 💔😭 such a scary situation for a child to go through
I was just wondering if the boot was still locked.   But you have saved them all than goodness you did
Is the car unlocked 🙄. Asking dumb questions. I hope she's ok and bless them for at least tryin
😢😢😢😢
That little boy is so incredibly brave! 🥺💕
You all are heros!! ❤
🙏❤
Why it looks like he's moving in slow motion 😮😮
That is a brave youngin who thought to find more help instead of just panic.
Oh man god help that family😢❤
It's good to see he recognized the signs and it was a seizure that's a good thing for the boy  That helped a lot right there
Hoping Mom survived 🙏🏼
Poor woman this guy' didn't jump in quickly to save the woman
Why first responders don't have a window punch is beyond me.
👍😀
This cops so dam slow. Talking is she in there did you not hear her son
I've always heard if you're in water and have nothing to crack the window that it's best,even tho horrifying, to let the car completely fill with water in order to open the door,cuz the pressure on the outside won't let it open until it's full of water inside. It would be terrifying, but beats drowning. But if your unconscious then I guess you just leave it up to God someone gets to you,
Poor kid if you know you have seizures don't be driving especially if you have kids. Good job young man and officers
God Bless you all!  ❤🙏🇺🇸
This Cop Is Amazing!! Bless him/ family!!❤❤❤
Praying lil boys mom will be ok 🙏
Thank you Once again Most High!!❤❤❤
❤🙏🏼❤️
So tragic  May God give her a speedy recovery and God Bless her Son  Thank you to all who helped especially the police officers who reacted so quickly
True terror in that boys face. God bless him.
How many times do a person have to deal with seeing something like that he seems like a very calm person who need to look at what was going on to make sure he makes the right decision it has nothing to do with color and the fact that he told the little guy "come on hop in" nobody knows a person heart and what they're thinking why they're in a situation like that  ,Just work on yourself and quit being so negative looking for something to be wrong all the time when here this is not an everyday thing that people see just work on yourself and see what you would have done in that situation no matter what color The baby got his MOM okay
Bravo son🎉 God's Armor over you all Thankyou God
Oh this poor child. 😢😢😢😢 Thank God his mom survived.
What a wonderful son and those who helped her
A cop wasn't doing s*** man
😢now he is going to grow up a thankful man appreciating life and helping others too
That would have been super scary.  Hope everyone made it out ok.  😢😢❤❤
Omg, thank you, Jesus!!! Her angel!!!! That poor baby!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why is she driving and she has seizures😢😢😢
Horrible situation
We see who’s saving whom don’t we?
God bless all of you!!!❤❤❤
John3v16-20
The cop was in no hurry if you ask me, poor kid was begging for help. Thx to the guy who was in the water already before the cop showed up.
Is the in there? Is the car unlocked? What a coward..  Jump in ask questions later
Oh my God heart crushing for little boy 🙏🙏
Praise Jesus
I'm not impressed with the cop he didnt seem to care! Who cares if the car was locked...he should have already been in the water breaking out a window or whatever he had to do to get her out faster! He could have been 5 mins faster at least! He probably did the speed limit returning with the kid! Poor example of help! We should pray he doesnt have to help anybody else or that he changes  the way he responds to someone in need! 😧 ❤❤❤
Don't get your unform dirty man 😒
Cop slow as fuck
Why was dude so slow......
"Is somebody in there?" He already told you his mom was in there... just take ur time......wtf
Is she in there?!?!?🤨 Is somebody in there?!?!? “My mom’s inside “ My question is didn’t that young man just tell you that his mom had a seizure and she’s sunk!
The boy. 🤦‍♀️😩😢 I hope his mommy made a full recovery and hope he is happy.
He was in the car with her, (the lil boy)...
The cop helped. He didn’t rescue. You literally see him standing there asking, “Is anyone in there????” After the son was begging him to come help. Only when he saw people surfacing with the mom did he bother to give a lending hand instead of asking questions that were already answered.
How patiently does this policeman ask if there is anyone in the car when the child had already told him!! This kind of people make me sick!
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
There’s nothing worse than to feel helpless as a child! Especially when it’s a parent. I can only imagine what a baby goes through when being torn apart during an abortion. If people knew that it’s the most barbaric thing on this planet, they would change the way they think!
My heart breaks for the boy.  Why was the woman driving if she's prone to seizures? Her children's lives are at risk!
Great team work!!!  If that were Ole Frank out in AZ he would demand to see ID first and make sure his camera was recording then ask lady why she decided to drive in pond.
She better not drive ever again! Glad she’s getting better, her poor son!
Aww poor boy so worried and thanks to him the men for saving her
You asking is someone in there like they can speak from under water dawg the cop is a bigot he act like the kid making the stuff up or the car in front of him isn’t sinking
😢😢😢
Some of these officers should work customer service or dispatcher jobs with those questions
A lot of people will see the officer's calm demeanor as complacency, but the ability not to panic in these situations only comes from experience. He did his job and went over and above. His tool saved the woman's life.
GOD bless this family and those that helped...what a traumatic day🙏🏾🌹🫶🏾
Poor boy! He is so scared but at the same time so brave for his mom ❤️
That precious baby boy. ❤
Hope his mama was ok we have a little Hero who if not for him she would have drowned and thankz to the ones who took her out of the car. You can here the terror  in his voice , you are your moms angel
That cop was moving slow and unbothered
This poor boy 😢
Sometimes the police make me want to pull my hair out, the boy is frantically asking for help telling him his moms in the car she needs help, then the cop proceeds to ask if she’s in there, is anyone in there and then asks if the doors unlocked 🤦‍♀️ If he would’ve just rushed to help he would’ve seen a woman in the car and if the door was unlocked for himself 😒
Sloth like response from the officer ...
Awwee this poor baby is terrified , thank you for these good samaratins who helped ❤
They don't show stuff like this on national news. Usually, they only show negatively.
❤🙏❤️🙏
I hate the phrase “Good Samaritan”. That implies that up until that point they had no other capacity to be good.
Respect to that cop! People can say what they want but some cops are not willing to go that far....like go into the water period to help someone. I remember when 3 teenage girls ended up in the water like that and those cops let them drown. Why...well maybe some are afraid of the water and cant swim or maybe they just didnt give a F but this cop here does.
Thanks to the courage of 2 men and an amazing boy
smart son   n a great cop n the great Samaritan 💪🙏👍
😢The poor boy he was so brave his cries broke my heart 😢
..the importance of mechanical "Roll Down" windows, vs Electric windows which are Rendered Useless in situations like this.
Respect ❤ to all involved!
Why is he telling him to hop in🤢
O my god ples help Tham and the car 🚗
Thought all white cops keel black people??
Is somebody in there?? Dude seriously you expecting her to swin out n say yeah I'm here?? The kid said she was in the water.
Brave young Son save his Mama life 💕
🙏🏾🙏🏾
Yeah don't get in a hurry
My heart hurts for that poor baby. Sending prayers.
What did he mean? Is there somebody in there? The little boy told him somebody was in there he needs to move faster, but thank God he helped her.
“Is somebody in there??”  No, officer, we’re just two kids joyriding our mom’s car. No way would she be drowning in this pond after I JUST told you she was drowning in this pond.
There was at least two good Samaritans.  Bless them and the cop and the big and his momma
I get palpitations watching these videos when the officers are as slow as molasses. They probably aren't as slow as I think they are but it sure feels like it watching.
White cop didn't want to save a black family. That's what's going on here. America is so great
The child's desperate cries to save his momma just broke my heart.   He was so brave.
He is a great kid he got help although freightened he was articulate and to the point.
That poor kid , prayers to him and his mother
Yeah that cop did not try to save shit he was like ok... let's go see .... what a joke 😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
U see thats the kinda coo who gets my respect
That little boy was trying to break the window to save his mom. I can’t believe he was doing all that. That’s unbelievable
Real life heroes!
Cops didn't save them he is just there yelling 😂😂😂 doing nothing he don't know what is he doing.
Cop seemed slow
Good people around 😮😮😮😢❤🥇
And he took way too long asking a bunch of questions what the hell
Poor baby 😢hope shes ok
The cop said is the car unlocked idiot who cares smash the window if you have to just get your ass in there and help her
What a sweet kid. A hero! ❤
I hope she is okay now and will not drive again herself... as far as i know in Holland and also Germany where i live now it is not allowed to drive yourself when there is a history of having such a health problem... Hope she gets good medication and lives a good and happy life ❤
Damn these evil cops saving these people. Get away you evil cop!
This had my nerves effed up! Grateful for everyone working together to save her.
Could he of acted any slower..
that cop was a ass for acting like the boy wasn't crying and running in the water crying for his mama wtf
TO. ALL   WHO HELPED   IN  THIS. LIFE  OR  DEATH   RESCUE. ❤❤❤THANKS  JAH GUIDE  U ALL THAT DAY ,YOUNG MAN, U HAVE  COURAGE  ❤ IMPORTANT    MOM
Cop a little slow
Die Verzweiflung in seiner angsterfüllten Stimme löst in mir Gänsehaut aus.  Ich hoffe sie war noch nicht zu lange darin eingeschlossen und hat überlebt.  Schrecklich Gott sei Dank waren Helfer in der Nähe um den kleinen Engel beizustehen. 🙏🏽
I hope all were ok . Poor child witnessing that . Thanks to the police and public . ❤❤❤❤
You cant park there...
Thank you for saving her - GOD BLESS YOU ALL ❤❤❤
People being praising the officer when he clearly wasn’t doing anything to help and was slow af. While the guy helping did all the work.
The cop say is somebody in there? Cars under water.
MEN did this! I don't see any strong, independent women in sight.
nope, just a cop
❤❤❤❤❤👍👍👍👍👍 👏👏👏👏👏
That baby boy will never be the same.... poor thing. I hope mama is doing well 😢
Asking all these questions is somebody in there? Is somebody in it? He already told you that get them out. Help him
Wow, stop and think what would you do in this situation? That kid is amazing!
Thank you for everyone who was there, cop or not! Petty ass people!
Man that poor family getting traumatized like that, I feel so bad for that little boy. I hope his mom is ok, it looks like he really loves her!
Slowest "help" I've seen. Frustrating 😤
I used to carry a pen 🖊 to work that had window puncher on the end of it too bad it was stolen by druggies. You never know what circumstances you're going to come across. Kids locked in cars, people trapped in water in cars.. never bought another one enough money already wasted..
Defund police? What idiot thought that would help people. We all need police, yes they hand out tickets and cost us money, and they can have bad attitudes. But then people resist arrest and don’t follow directions. But the end result, sometimes we all need them🙏🏻
Thank God he knew to keep his head on and give the information 😢. May he be blessed, and never have to tey tonsave his mum again. Traumatizing
That kid deserves a raise
Im so sorry you had to go thru this trauma. Thank you to everyone who helped I hope mom is ok❤
She died 3 days after this. She was my Wife’s Niece. Real nice lady.
Good Samaritan plus Brave cop
Such a brave boy!!!
That cop is a pos wouldn't move a muscle unless that kid was there "is there someone in there" no shii the kid only said that as soon as he rolled up and two other times dude is a horrible cop
Is anyone in there?!! Let me see your hands, don’t reach, don’t move, show me your id
I dont like how long it took that cop to get her out of there
Who the hell gave her the keys?! I swear women can’t drive anything.
The cop is like is somebody in there. Of course the little kid just told you she was getting that car and get her out.
I don’t know why im getting suggested clips from a channel I’ve never looked up or subscribed to
Her son was the main one that play a big roll on saving her because he kept insisting that she was in the car and saying her medical condition, he’s the hero in the story
Great job and many blessings to the officer who stopped to help.
“She’s in the water!” “Is anyone in there?”
The officer is wasting time questioning if someone's in their mother f***** the kid didn't drive the car into the water he clearly told you his mother's in there so quit wasting time
And this is the type of cop I don't want on the job!  How many times does the boy have to scream that his mother is still in the car, obviously drowning since the front of the car was completely submerged in the water!?!?!  Dude, you're slow in all aspects.  It literally takes less than 3 minutes to drown, and he's still trying to "assess the problem?"  I'm surprised he finally got in the water since he took so long to figure out his next move.  He could've called for backup, too, during his break!  I can't believe the cops thought it was a good PR move to show this "rescue."  And for the "All cops are heros, and you shouldn't criticize them" cult followers:  let's recreate this scenario where you're the drowning mom waiting to be rescued in the same time-frame it took for this cop to rescue her in the lake.  Tell me if you still think he's a hero after you wake up from your coma.
So frightening. What a strong, brave young boy. So proud of him and all who assisted. God bless.
Awesome rescue!! The boy is a hero!!😃👍🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Asking if someone is in there after the kid is yelling for help and a voice is coming from car. Ugh
That cop didn’t do anything, he not the one got the lady out, sum one else did
What yuh mean if somebody in there! He tell yuh his mom!! He didn’t want to get in that water! Took him long enough 😢😡
People that have seizures should not be allowed to drive. There only putting thenselfs and OTHERS in danger.
OMG! That is so terrifying for that baby. 😢
Why was he so hesitant to go in the water? Why are u gonna ask if she is in there your wasting time in she is was unconscious and can't respond
Did he get her out ?
That's why you don't drive when your seizures are not controled.
That poor baby, it looks like he was able to get out of the car and run down a highway to get help!
Wow that cop was very slow. The kid had to demand for help
True Hero ❤❤❤
Glad they saved them - it’s just amazing how people just do and go safe no thoughts for their own safety - some humans are superheroes - so happy they live among us❤️❤️❤️
Well done everyone, I hope she's okay.
God bless that police officer and a kid and that woman
Oh My Heart That Poor Child! How Scared must have been! That was The day like it or not, He became a Man.
Thank you so much 🙏❤️
Why the hell you gone ask or yell if someone is in there when you see a car in water and this young man crying for help smh
The cop...is useless smh
That cop staring at the car asking iS aNyOnE In ThErE while the boy is screaming its my mom she had a seizure like he really couldnt kick it into high gear?  Im not a cop but if i saw that id jump in no hesitation I wouldnt ask the sinking car if anyone is in there…. What a joke at least someone else was there to balance out the stupidity smh
😢hope she was ok
Thank you, officer.
🙏💝 Bless them all. Glad she’s okay. 🤔I see that the police DO know how to turn on their camera.
Oh my Goodness,  she had a seizure while driving... That poor child.  Thank God to ALL   whom helped to save her life
God bless the cop and the other person 🙏
poor baby how traumatizing
What happened? Was she saved?
This had me holding my breath 😢😢
Look at God always there when u need him ❤️ God bless. u
Why do people always have to down the police,like uou could have done better,if you not in that kind of situation  at that moment you don't  know what the hell you would have done,or how fast hou would have dkbe ,can't  anyone just be thankful for the out come and keep your negative mouth to yourself.
💝💝💝🙏🙏🙏
That officer slow as hell
Blessings to them
The cop sure took his sweet time trying to help.
Those are good cops,did the lady survive ???????
Prayers brave boy hope all is over
This officer has zero sense of urgency. Unbelievable.
This incident aged that child.
God bless this boy and his mom! And thank you to the men that rescued her! ❤❤❤
Thank you and God bless this boy, officer and all eho assisted. I hope she made it.  Having a seizer under water is the worst. Made me forget who my children were for a bit. I had one in tub.
Geez just go in he already told him she was in there he takes his sweet time
White police officer reacues black woman. Wont see that on a lot of social media.
Driving and you know you suffer from seizures is very dangerous!!!
Now this is why we have the police!!
Thy neighbors keeper. Thank you❤❤❤
So, how’s the mom?
Her son is the brave Samaritan who saved her life! If it wasn’t for him saving himself going for help who would know? Well done young man well done 👏
🙏🏾
Bless that sweet boy. 😢  Thank God she was rescued.
Prayers to this little one, his morher, and family 🙏🏼
The young man said "ow my foot" but is then in the water bangin on the window trying to save his mom.
That kid saying that’s my mom help her 🥲🥲🥲
This was so emotional
Bless his huge heart❤ Hope his mom was okay..
Is she in their? No, she got out, left her child on his own, swam to shore, and headed to her job at Walmart. What idiotic questions wasting precious time.
Prayers for this family. And the great officer and EMS
OMG!!! The panic in this sweet boys voice. My heart broke for him. Hope they’re doing well! ♥️🙏🤲
Cops probably arrested her
I pray for her full recovery, and that brave.Young man
This is the main reason why if you do have epileptic seizures do not drive a car.Especially with your children and it
Stupid cop the kid's telling you she's in there
That boy had just said in hurry her mom was in that car and his mom was sunk..., and that cop yaled "is somebody in there?" How could she answered while she's sunk..., what a preety quick movement...😓
"Is there someone in there?"   DUH?!
Bless his heart thank you officer
Someone please tell me this boy actually kept his mama
Poor child, I’m sorry but maybe she shouldn’t drive especially when seizures are unpredictable. I hope she’s ok n hope the child be ok as well. Glad cop didn’t waste time
Why did the cop take so long to go down there and help her?
HERO
Bless his heart❤️🤍❤️
Thought all cops were bad.  Guess the media lied
Damn man, move fast. Sorry, but when sh*t goes down, I jump into action. Ask questions later. Every second counts. That boy knows what Im talking about. I could sense his frustration and sense of urgency.
Imaging a cop barley caring when momma is drowning. Thats hell
This is the love that the Democrats don't want you to see. It's their worst nightmare.
Glad the citizen was there.
Cop was acting like he had all day to save her
She should not be driving.  How he managed to escape unharmed is a miracle.
Idk the cop was pissing me off
Kids panicking yet explained the situation perfectly. The cop was still yelling at the car like the drowning woman having a seizure is going to answer. I understand protocol, but damn.
That boy.  Breaks my heart my son is 10.    Jeez.  Heartbreaking
That has got to be the worst cop in the world. He can clearly see the cars in the water. The poor kid told him she has  seizures and yet he continues to ask him questions, takeing his slow ass time. I guess he didn't want to get his boots wet
Why is he asking is anyone in there the boy told him he didn't drive himself
I pray she’s better and they are both getting the help they need
He said she having a seizure. What do you want her to do put her hand out the window and wave.
God bless you both!
God bless this sweet boy!
I feel like the officer wasn't worried at all. The boy said his mom is in there having g a seizure yet the cop waits patiently to get a response by asking a car submerged under water if "is there anyone in there?" What the hell was ge expecting. Looks like he got back put of the water while a good Samaritan jumped in and got her out. Wasn't till then that he looked worried and rushed back in the water. Noticed how the video cuts out? Also shows nothing after wards.
I hope she is okay 🙏
Thank You for saving her. Her son needed you and didn't turn your back Officer Thank You
Pooo boy he out told the cop what happen and boy went back in water trying break the window. U see him there the yellow tee shirt he was determine to get save his mama. That's scary and over whelming. It the good lord who he there to help that bot family  after it happen. Thank God the boy got out to tell someone,  somebody. Cop had a tool he handed to the boy.
At least 1 person wanted to help quickly....🙄
Hope that wasn’t in Florida
Poor baby
💔💔💔💔💔🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
That cop took the fucking time until the kid screamed “help her!!”. Although you could assume, based on kid that mother is black so urgency goes down significantly. Its not like white woman is drowning or a dog.
The cop was slow the boy and the girl both said a woman was in the car
Thank God for Good Samaritans!
The cop wasn’t exactly running to the rescue! He just told him his mom was in there and sinking and having a seizure .. “is somebody in there?” As if he could hear an answer 😂
You have no business being on the road if you have a seizure disorder
That cop didn’t save that woman on his own. There was already a man in the water at the car. The two of them plus the little boy saved that  woman’s life . Thank you all three of you.
Hero Young Man!  What happened to his mom, was she okay?
Omg.  It takes superhuman self conte to not fall apart and push past your own panic to be able to understand that calm clear communication in that situation is VITAL.
See young man NOT ALL COPS R BAD!
Hope, this woman is well now ✝️ 🙏 🤲
Thank God for police man willing and able to help!!!!❤from NJ
🙏🙏
This officer was in  slow motion with helping a person possibly drowning..hopefully the women survived
This hit different, seeiin that boy, soaking wet, obviously got himself free, his plea ta the officer, an the officer on job.  Love That.. Prayiing All Are Good...
Oh god 😢😢😢poor boy .Thank you sir❤
Dmn poor kid on top thank u gator for not attacking u know there was a gator in there if florida
Man police ask to many questions n re act real slow.. I would of 0 to 100 rq
Poor little boy 😢😢😢
Thank you for each heroic person’s efforts and fast thinking in this dramatic video news report ❤❤❤❤❤❤ Thanksgiving is every day.
Can't believe they missed the best opportunity to say, "you can't park there mate."
Poor kid.
Good he held a phone instead of using both of them to help her
God bless she makes a full well recovery 😢🙏
Is she okay?!
"Is the car unlocked"
Brave young man.  God bless them
😢poor baby boy😭😭😭🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
❤❤❤❤
That poor boy mustv been terrified 😨 😢 what a brave young man 2 put his fear aside & get help!
🙏
what a brave young man. All in all he was very levelheaded and concise. Sure he was a little upset, but who wouldn’t be. His mother and father had every reason in the world to be extremely proud of him. And thank you to the good Samaritans, who stepped in to help. God bless you all!
❤️❤️❤️
God bless
That poor kid had to practically beg that cop to help his mom. WTF. He couldn't be more clear. She's in the car submerged in water with the doors closed.
I hope  the mom is ok
This is so traumatic.  My cousin and her two boys went into the creek about a month ago.  All three died.  So sad.  Brave little boy! Thank God for all the people that helped in this situation!
The cop for damn sure didn’t give a FUCK at all!!! Shout Out to the KID & those GOD sent Samaritans 💯 F the police they no help & no good
He literally said HELP HER! Wile the officer is asking if anyone is in there debating wether he needs to get his uniform wet or not.
If this is white kid then cop reaction will be different
Im annoyed by the slowfulness of the cop 🙄. Glad shes out and hopefully doing well
Poor kid man seeing your mama like that is some of the most traumatic stuff that can happen to you as a kid.
That's so sad but thank God for good cops!
Good thing she wasn’t traveling alone
Please: whomever posted this. How can we help? Me and probably others would love to help this family ❤
How scary for that child!!  He was brave and did the right thing!!  You will forever be your Mom's hero!!
Scary situation!! Thank you officer for this rescue!! ❤
Dragul de el, of Doamne cât de speriat este 😢😭 Câtă neputință în sufletul lui 😭 Mă bucur că și mama să este bine datorită celui ce a reușit să o salveze ❤❤❤
Our God is so awesome 👍 thank God Almighty for having this cop, on time 🙏🙏 blessing 😇🙏 be upon them all in the name of Jesus Christ 💕🙏
Looks to me that the Samaritan and kids were doing the saving , God Bless them I'm in awe over him just asking things over and over after being informed , i mean yes hes doing his job and etc not judging him just would hope his hesitationness doesn't get the best of him in his field , however everyone working together made an effort and had a great outcome im glad her babies still have her God Bless
The cop  helped but I feel like he was moving to slow for me  Ike come on
For those of you critical of the officer response, he was talking to a citizen who saw what happened and entered the water the help before he got there according to news report
I HATE SEIZURES!! Loss my son too them!!!
Is somebody in thurr🥴🥴 what an idiot
these newer cars it’s difficult to break the side glass now as the make it like the front, shatter proof. Their would be more survivors if they stuck with glass.
Idiot shouldnt have drove knowing she has that condition
He said 5 times shes in the water
Poor kid. He was so worried for his mom 😢
This is heartbreaking to watch
That's so heartpounding!   I hope she's okay.  That's scary.
I really appreciate the rescue effort but the slow walking is irking me. She’s having a seizure underwater for god sakes.
Omgoodness thank goodness you were there
Damn poor kid, jfc
That cop could’ve had even a LITTLE sense of urgency. I’ve seen people move faster in a Starbucks line
What Good Samaritan doesn’t act instinctively, he was already briefed the whole ride there that kid mom had a seizure and went under the water, why proceed acting disinterested, & calling out if you are having a seizure and are under water what should can you make other than gulp gulps? Seriously can you re respond yes I’m in seizure and drowning?? Be So Fkn fr ..
Oh my God I hope she lives so sad😢😢
Can he move like he thought a white woman was in there 😡😡
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Thank You Sir!!!❤  God Bless You for Caring!!!😊❤
Hero is the little boy😢😢his face love him...❤
I hope the boys mother is ok. My heart breaks for that little boy.
❤RESPECT❤ to the individuals who helped that momma😢 God bless you❤
How slow is the cop?
What’s up with his hesitation to save people. Why does he need confirmation that someone is in the car. The kid just told you. Go look bro. Slow ass cop.
What is he asking stupid questions for, wasting precious time
Thank you first responder for saving saving them God bless you God bless them and I hope and pray everything be okay🙏🏾🙌🙏🏾💝🙏🏾🙌🙏🏾
Ok, after some digging, I found out she is ok. Thank goodness. She is still in the ICU. But was recently weaned off the ventilator. I wanted to update.  I know some of you, like me, wonder what happened after the video. My heart was breaking watching this. I felt so badly for her and her son.
This was frustrating to watch.. Cop had no sense of urgency whatsoever.. moved at the slowest pace ever.. and asked the kid twice if anyone was in there when the kid told him 3 times… ugh !!!!
In Jesus name , all be ok
So. If youre in a car thats going under or is under. You really are not going to have a great chance of shattering the side windows. For a bunch of reasons. Your best chance is to donkey kick the front or back windsheild. They are attached with glue around the rim. You can pop that sh*t off. And you have the leverage/space to kick those windows harder. Hope this is not helpful.
Thank y'all for saving her thank you Jesus you was right on time praying for her and the young man 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
He went back for a window punch , everyone telling him to hurry up.
I mean, good on the cop but Jesus….could he have moved any effing slower?
What a scare for that baby❤
Heartbreaking.   Praise the Lord for this hero ❤❤❤❤
I know they talk slow in the South, but damn, get energized, wake TFU!  Someone’s life may depend on your ability to react quickly.🥱🥱🥱
So frustrating how the cop just stood there looking. He knew damn well there was someone in the car..
Could he waddle any slower? Damn
Poor baby, that boy was able to articulate that his Mama needed help. God bless
What a slow ass cop...poor child.
the cop acting like he thought he was geing set up . Nearly lost the passengers life smh
Sweet Angel. He was so upset. GOD bless you baby
Kid just told him someone is in there...
❤❤❤❤
