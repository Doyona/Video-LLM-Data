The animations of movement sometimes are to quick for those big giants making them look like weightless, i mean they are too quick comparing with presents gaints species. Even they move a little slow coz of thier weight, But i know the point of gravity doesn't exist in movies 😅😅 (set up the playback speed at 0.80/0.85)

If you showed me the new supernova trailer That's where the new monster should be. or rather, there should be a new monster, for example, a monitor lizard, a monster that appeared in the movie of '58. which was shot by the same studio that gave you the rights to but on the wound on the king of the mountain and other stuff about

Gozilla x king kong the new empire
Ladies and gentlemen, the movie is officially 1 year old!!!  At this point the movie works best when it’s busy focusing on the monsters themselves  Sad to say that the human characters are becoming less interesting and one-dimensional They’re good actors but man they need better writing and they dump a lot of exposition Like I said the action and special effects are enough to keep fans engaged especially kids Plus having Kong interact with the other apes and monsters without being vocal helps the visual storytelling, you can easily tell what’s going on from their expressions  A better script would’ve helped this convoluted plot and less clunky line readings but the fights are the real reason to watch these many Monsterverse films Who knows where they go from here?

Hi
Like if you agree with this comment what if godzilla's some ancestors were still alive in a secret place and storing radiation and to evolve and how the survived all these years
2:30 7 palabras: E S E N C I A
Godzilla probably thought he killed Skar king in the ancient war but until he had a sense that he was still alive
Nice👍

This was epic , entertaining,  amazed,  great quality graphics , funny, just extraordinary.  Hat off to the makers of such fantastic film . Even my 2 year old enjoyed it .
Es una falta de respeto que el audio de este trailer no sea el rap de Keyblade.
DEI movie smh
The next movie should be called  Godzilla X Kong and the reign of destroyah

LEGENDARY! , this movie was freaking awesome !!! The actors are as awesome ! LETS GOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥😆🍿🤍🤍
I feel like they stole all the idea and shimo ideas from , how to train your dragon 2,
When will we get Suko vs Doug
long live the king (GODZILLA)
Probably the maddest film I've seen in years. Loved it.
Is this film based on true events?
Is this on PS5 ?😂😂
The guy from fortnite?
Wait that’s the guy from fortnite
1:02 They misled Godzilla being afraid. Bro seemed eager for this fight to happen and prepped himself up for it big time.
2:27
Kong is big and cool
It’s funny when you realize if Kong would’ve just thrown scar king into the lava with the crystal then he could have stopped it on his own
Monkeys in soldiers a killer monster and a gorilla the most powerful it should win impossible in coordination together with several emotional moments and a means of finance
It's the same french true story
2:02 2:05 2:08 2:09 2:12   2:19 2:22 2:23 2:25

When, I seen Kong, meeting and finding another ape🦍 , gorilla 🦍 species. I was like what?  No way. All of Kong’s,  species, have died, and extinct.
When, I first saw this movie trailer, I was shocked and confused at first.  I was thinking to myself.  So is Kong,  the king of his species, or is someone else is??   I kept, thinking to myself please, show Kong’s, and Godzilla’s,  origins.  How their first ancestors meet each other.  And why their ancestors, don’t like each other.

Kong carried the film so hard.Godzilla barely did anything
This was the best movie i sawAnd also is godzilla a girl? meh sister said that
Can someone tell the owner of Warner to sell his company to a better person ffs they literally destroying all franchises
I was utterly disappointed in this movie...
I just watched this. Totally awesome.❤❤❤
Nah the battle between kong and Shen Godzilla vs scar king and shemo was epic, but shemo never deserved that, scar king controlled her with pain. The one who ate a star, perfect name for Godzilla, also, Mothra was too cute! But I don’t recall moths shooting webs? She only comes out at the end of the world, when someone from the telepathy peoples tribe returns and awakens her, she’s out to protect and help Godzilla and kong
❤❤❤❤😊😊😊

Real cholo vibes in this movie
Best trailer ❤
Every year my city (Apeldoorn, Netherlands) host a big outdoor movie event called openair film festival, its a massive cinema, but in a big grass field in the middle of a forest with a projector screen as big as trees and dozens of surround speakers all over the field. I've been there 2 times before and cant wait to see this over there
This movie sucks so bad!! Terrible!
GHK
How come they could say yes to this master piece but not the Batman Beyond movie
😂
Kong Godzilla help to fight with  star king
Just watched this movie.   Simply terrible.  Like watching a 90 minute cartoon.   I just can't imagine someone writing the screenplay for this movie.   Then he takes the little gorilla and uses it to smash the other apes and then throws him to the ground and the little guy gets up and looks angry but is otherwise unhurt and then gives that cute little monkey face (for the 50th time in the movie)....totally stupid plot.    Totally overacted characters.   The franchise needs to end.
Hey warner, just quit. By far one of the dumbest movies ever made. Sad to see americzilla get completely f%^ked after the fairly good first movie.

J'ai beaucoup aimé la bataille finale de godzilla et kong contre le roi skar et shimo.
I think the 1st Godzilla vs Kong was way better then this
Kannada language😢
Damn shame it's come to this.
There are unlimited cities with skyscrapers in this cinematic universe ripe for destruction lol
Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire is a good movie in terms of fun factor  While Godzilla 2014 is better in terms of realism
after watching Toho's Godzilla. This one feels kinda lame
One day Godzilla is ruining the cities and now he's defending the earth... what?
Sucks big time

One thing for sure, when they Fight, all Cities & Towns will be Destroyed & Grid Dwn. New Empire is the Fall of the Old one (LotsOfCasualties)🖖🏽🛸👽🛸🖖🏽
They keep doing my boy Long dirty..... If a 300ft gorilla landed a right cross on Godzilla, that lizards head would pop like a freaking water balloon.... Even without the steel knuckles....
Sorry but this is unrealistic.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How about leaving Godzilla to the Japanese. They do it best. Watched Godzilla Minus One and it was fantastic, compared to this Garbage.
This is a awsome action packed movie 🍿 a must see
I wanna see the lil Kong grow up.
There's a homeless guy who lives down the road from me in a disused Blockbuster Video store who kinda looks like Godzilla. Doesn't dress the same but their facial features are pretty similar.
We want to see Rodan again
Kong big time no competition
Happy Ending
This looks corny af. Very 2024.
This is legendary
Sad how Hollywood tried to derail G minus one

I waited along time to see this ans the disappointment is amazing. Stop trying to make monster movies about the people stories, the whole story line sucked not enough monsters
Trailer ❌ Music ✅
Gadzilla is the embodiment of the Japanese fear of the nuclear explosions of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which, like Gadzilla, destroyed their cities , however, for their fascism. The same fear as the fear of ashes instead of snow in the movie "Silent Hill"
Gayest movied ever
🤌🏻🤌🏻
The next movie should be called “Godzillas revenge” and he kills destroyah

You wanted to know how Godzilla stays on top of the water he bragged his tail like a puppy dog that's how 🇺🇸
the only complaint I have for this movie is that, the lightnings are way TOO BRIGHT! (-someone who has astigmatism) 😭
Please launch next part realy i happy to watch this movie 🎥.thanks for made❤
"Kong can't stop this on his own"  "He won't be alone"  Godzilla Kong busting out of the ground 🔥 "They don't have to like each other, they just have to work together"  Kong punching with Beast Glove and both of them roaring together.  Still gives me Goosebumps. One of the best trailers ever
You might be wondering, why is godzilla pink, spoiler alert: Technically, Godzilla fights Tiamat for radiation and obviously Godzilla wins so Godzilla finds where Tiamat's radiation is so he sleeps over there, then After days he is Pink like Tiamat

How was this movie? Worth buying a physical release for?
Do you know how many clips and fight scenes they literally copied from a small youtube channel called OTV who makes stop motion Kong films. Almost scene for scene.
No one is equal to kong he is king
Lol King Kong is the son and now he beat he’s dad lol
Godzilla minus one tops this by a mile, godzilla is supposed to be feared and they don't get that fear aspect in these movies
Please, please, please, when the HD copy is available, can someone edit out all the human protagonists in this movie so we get  to see what we ONLY came here to see?
そろそろ最強の敵ヘドラが出て来る頃かな
Смешно! В нынешней ситуации старый мешок с говном байденюк раскрасил бы Конга нацистской символикой и отправил бы его в свинорейх защищать бандеровских фашистов от москалей🤦🏻
Godzilla x kong went to the on the
another bad movie
1:05  I like how trapper just winks at Bernie and then Bernie is like “OH MY GOD AHHHHHHHH”
The trailer is sick
look like shimo or shimu?
Please coming 3 gxk movie 😢
Godzilla afraid of nothing 😂
Next monster movie: monster hunters with Godzilla
Is it gonna be on netflix😂
I'm getting this next paycheck. Can't wait to see it. Just got done watching Godzilla Minus One. Great movie as well.
Something about this trailer makes me cringe, but not quite sure what it is.
Banger trailer, fr fr 😂
I don’t understand how special effects are getting WORSE over time… The apes in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, a film now 11 years old, look more realistic than ANYTHING in this movie.  It’s seriously a travesty that these movies cost around $150-250 million with a big chunk of that going to the effects department… FOR WHAT!?  Jurassic Park is now 31 years old and looks better than ANYthing made in the 2000’s. Maybe it’s time we went back to practical effects because watching what amounts to cartoons interacting with real people onscreen TOTALLY takes me out of the movie.
I thought the girl was Zendaya
How to download  this movie... please send the website link
🎉I really liked it, I watched the full movie in a movie treater,THANKS Warner bros!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
2:31 I can’t stop replaying this part 😎
i wonder if Titanus mokele mbembe, amhuluk, Sekhmet, Abbadon, bunyip, Baphomet, leviathan, na kika, yamata no orochi, typhon, Quetzalcoatl, and Camazotz appeared in the next godzilla movie.
They ruined the franchise with that Godzilla making a hole in the earth thing.
doomfist's gauntlet!!!
Godzilla Minus One is waaaay better
Fun fact: the tooth was on the opposite side in the movie
This movie is so much fun..i cant stop laughing of its illogical. Lol. 🤣🤣🤣
Nothing but DEI Woke garbage.
Looks mid
They Kathleen Kennedied it. Boo!
2:52 Let’s do this
It is not like 2021 that movie had strong and powerful looking villain and it had it own song ( Here we go)
Great movie , don’t care what they say but Godzilla minus one is not even in the same realm in terms of visuals this just looks better and much more fun and colourful in my eyes . Critics are just quick to say nonsense for the sake of click bait and views they liked the movie just don’t want to admit it. The argument of the people playing small roles is stupid to me because the aim of it is to watch to monsters mess stuff too and fight so of course people are only added for context to explain the story and that’s okay they should be side characters in a movie about MONESTERS
Some moments sound like Charile screaming I swear.
What a dissapointment of a Godzilla/Kong movie.
Cool scene but Godzilla Minus One is a masterpiece.
Gru
I really enjoyed this movie. Sometimes you just need to watch a movie like this
Esta pelicula es una obra maestra me encanto
2:27 - 2:29 Lol 🤣😂🤣😂😂
Godzilla has ssj rose and ssj blue
Ssj rose
The more movies they keep making, the more stupid they get
In son of Kong please add a Titan that have energy of that any Titan can kill him so the hight will bigger than x5  the Titan that kill the warbat which Kong was like a ant so kong will take help Godzilla also know that Titan is Godzilla also to kill Titan it have energy of bigger sige 5x but Godzilla will kill the Titan but it is small please add this I am your big fan
01/06/24
🔥 It is epic and a whole lots of awesomeness. Get ready for the fight ❄
Humans were unbearably cringe as always. Better cut their screentime and give it to the monsters instead. Nobody sad about that that
Seeing the film last month was amazing i left the theater smiling , but i really want to see phosphera and will godzilla find his species ?
Just watched the new Godzilla, I thought it was very nice. Came to see big monster, saw many big monsters, am happy.
Kong died
I really wanna see a Godzilla vs Space Godzilla movie
Please get rid of the writers from these last two movies... They are complete garbage!
Box office successssss
Why 13:13 Brothers why
The movie was like a salesman who showed up & wouldn’t shut up.
Please send it full picture hindi dubbed
Fullmoveon
OH VERY TIMELY. KPOP GROUP TREASURE JUST RELEASED THEIR NEWEST SINGLE, "KING KONG". PLEASE CHECK IT OUT. IT'S SO GOOD!
2:53 after watching the movie and SPOILER ALERT     I truly didn’t expect mothers to be resurrected AGAIN, and the did a good job editing her outta the trailer here
They should have left it at Godzilla 2014. Adding sequels helped make that movie into a joke as well . The most useless godzilla movie of all time.
i love godzilla so muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
This movie is a joke. Titans are fighting in anti-gravity.
I watched Godzilla x kong the new empire in the movies it was AWESOME
This has Fast and the Furious Juice Injected in it lol
Kongs BEAST glove reminds me of fallouts power fist glove in a way
Who wants to watch this beyond age 5?
The best Godzilla x Kong movie ever 2:49
Team kong.Bestmovie ever
Fun fact: The line at 1:27 and the line at 2:22 and the line at 2:28 were never actually said in the movie.
Looks completely nonsense movie
Whoever wrote this utter piece of garbage needs to be blacklisted from ever contributing to another movie, ever. Deus ex after deus ex after deus ex. 🤮
Approved!
They would never allow Kong to beat Godzilla.
godzilla x kong = arcade mode godzilla minus one = realism mode
Лучший фильм за последние 10 лет! Ни намека на ЛГБТ, чисто доброе фэнтези. 5*!
Its literally the best movie wish they make 10 of kong and godzilla 🐲
Savhcs ss ziz sezhhzs
I hate it when they show final battle scenes in the trailer. Also they show the best part's of the movie in the trailer
The tooth scene got me 😂
Looks like a video game not a movie 😂😂
They look so fake. AI is horrible on here. I liked the ones where they used robotic ones. Like in the early 2000s late 90s
Why did they make the doctor dog ugly in this one?
Movie sucked
This is a bit confusing I dunno
1:09 мoжит делать гадеила
I went to the movies to watch this and it was so good :one place scared me so bad
Why they call it a movie?More like Cartoon Movie,90 % cartoon and 10 % movie.And ppl pay to watch that?First was good second was ok but this one,c on🤔
Such a stupid movie ))
skibidi toilet rizz movie
My kids ❤️  loved this movie.  My daughter said dad it ipwas awesome 😂😂😂
Ufff!... That Minus One was so bad but so bad tgat I was thinking I'm done with Godzilla movies I'm glad my curiosity won cause I would've missed out this wasn't amazing like the 1998 for me remains as number 1 but this was pretty good.
Things looks less realistic which the new cinema technology.
ger
Here after watching the movie. Who directed this silly mess, Taika Waititi? So much goofiness, much more than in GvK. The pace is all over the place, soundtrack is awful, and the plot in general is, again, silly. And, yet again, complete disregard to what we had before GvK - both in style and the plot. Disappointed. Tone down childish humor, bring back Edwards or Jordan Vogt-Roberts(Kong. Skull island), and don't forget to give music to Henry Jackman(also Skull Island). Only then the future of this franchise can be salvaged.
This time sound system suks
God Zilla got a new Power Kong got Full Metal Puncher also they Working together as Partner even they are still not Friends😅
Loved Kong and Godzilla but the movie was boring
Boring movie
So Godzilla went to Barbie

do you have to watch the first one to watch this one?
Seen this yesterday at the cinema, this is badass 💥😍
This movie is so intense! 😲
What a masterpiece, i got teary eyed watching this movie. LFG
there milking this franchise for every drop
Suppose to see this Wednesday. Now idk 🤷‍♀️ anyone have any reviews 😉🙌🙌🙌🙏
Next sequel : kong meet his girlfiend or his future wife and get happy family with king and queen kong's son and daughter
Not a fan of bad college style corny productions.  This is pure manure
This movie sucked
Very good movie, exceeded my expectations
We got Godzilla x kong 's second collaboration before gta 6
Gorila vs kong
Godzilla with super saiyan rose is insane
Wow Rebecca Hall is shockingly awful
Horrible film the series needs a direction change fo darker and focus more on Godzilla. Bring in out of world elements. Go in the direction of minus 1 but with the bit G as a good guy
I've seen some awful movies in my day but this is by far the single worse movie in 30 yrs. This is pure garage. I'm shocked that Rebecca Hall and Dan Stevens signed on to this mess. Please save your $$$$. If you go you'll be sorry. You could say there was no plot or there were 10 plots and none of them made sense. Just 1:29 mins of special effects that meant nothing. Even the music was stupid. They used music from an old rock band from the 70s. Just bizarre from start to finish.
Crazy how this was 3 months ago
This was an absolutely woke brutal movie. The CGI in this is horrible. The CGI of the first Kong with Jack Black was amazing. It's like CGI is worse today. Woke lead actress, ya got a tranny in there also. Dude this was beyond a brutal and woke movie. Just a total bummer
Muyyyyyy bienaaaa
Muuyyyy bueno

Worst King Kong movie ever
Couldn't you have worked Cthulhu into the giant monster universe?
Poor Rio de Jineiro.
Ep😊
I think this is the first Godzilla movie I really disliked. The best part. IMO, was when Kong was beating the other Kongs with the mini Kong.
Is this movie for 8 years olds? Is this a kids movie? Im just asking...lol
when the film has budget but no brain.
So they basically turned monsterverse into Marvel Superhero movie. Working together, thinking like humans and fighting an evil army. Kong even got the gauntlet and in the next movie he will probably look for infinity stones..
I enjoyed watching this one. Anyone who is watching this trailer, watch the movie in a theater.
They made it like they did other good movies...they made it Stupid a Kids Move they made like they did all  Marvel Avenger movie and they did it Horribly...it got Worse and Worse with every movie
Teamwork is always a dream work. I love this movie.
Trzeba będzie obejrzeć
Summary of the movie:   Lizard and monke vs lizard and monke
Vay amk ya mükemmel ötesi bir film
This one is the BEST so far❤I’m sooo touched
This is the worst godzilla, kong film ever, acting is poor, comedy bits are not funny, cgi that is just awful, just hope these are not becoming like marvel films, godzilla minus one blows this completely out of the water and for just $15 million!
You should make king kong more powerful because most of the community loves kong . Make him more muscular and increase hit height
Weird how holllywood continues to support the same people that destroy museums & block highways & railroads 🤔🤔🤔
Same mod i download in minecraft😂😂😂😅
ITS GOING DOWN !!!!!
mother iri frozen happen. :) SINETRON BUDDHA.
Hollywood and its extreme woke destroys every franchise it touches. It's unwatchable. This movie's concept and exact humour, plot, characters development and traits have been seen countless of times previously. They use the exact same structure and protocol everytime. They simply can't get themselves to make a good movie, they really need to add their woke agenda to every single freaking movie.
Poor Kong never gets a break 😂
Лучший фильм в моей жизни, рекомендую
The biggest load of shite I've ever had the misfortune of suffering. WTF!?
What a masterpiece again :-)
How can a girl grow up to be so ugly... Strong Female know it all boss lady was soooo annoying.
Is it about the monsters or the unnaturally diverse cast of undesirables and woke type females? God.. Japan makes far better Godzilla. We western people can't make a film without DEA influence.
I feel so bad for the people trashing this film, its like they expect everything they watch to be a 10/10 or its trash. Sure this movie didnt have the greatest plot but god damn the action in this was amazing. Can't imagine having such high expectations on something so trivial.
Why do I find and imo the 2014 Godzilla movie is the best and the most epic-jaw dropping monsterverse movie? the movie was better than the new ones and still gives me goosebumps everytime I see the monster, probably bcs the movie was on a different perspective bcs you saw the monsters as a human perspective not from theirs, so you see and feel how gigantic the creature really is, the monsters walking slowly through the cities and all… idk let me know what you guys think :3
Kinda sucks to say but damn minus one godzilla is the real godzilla.
How bottom Earth get light? Pls explainl
I didn't care for the movie
Technically they are friends, but humans not accept it ❤
well the year ain't over yet but this year 2024 godzilla x kong i rate it 10 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
nha bro when is this gone arrive on yt...bc i accidently didnt go to the movie and watch it...
WOOOW!!? BROS!
Why always kong is the hero ? Why is not godzilla ?
Can someone please make a skin dc for kratos and atreus as kong and mini kong? Also the axe and gauntlet included
The story is nothing special, the Climax Fight action Sequence of Godzilla Kong & Titans was tremendous, for the action movie one time watch #Belovavarge Movie🤏 children enjoying a movie
Kong looks like Mike Tyson ❤
Good
Now is here the movie
Every jungle shot with any human is blur af it makes me sick Stop this blur the backgound cgi bs it looks really bad
I rate 8/10, it would be even better to 10/10 if the storyline was made longer into 2 parts and more tense. I would have expected more shots from the human side at close range when they fight. adding footage from the human side when the destruction occurs as a result of their fight will be more tense.  and there should also be movement from the government on the surface of the earth. It's really strange that there is no government movement when Godzilla has absorbed PINK's energy. At least there is a misunderstanding between the government and the monarch which will make it even more exciting, not just the fight between monsters, as if humans just gave up when the fight between monsters occurred.  for example GODZILLA MINUS ONE, MINUS ONE takes more footage from the human side and the destruction of cities which makes it even more EPIC. the after-effects of the explosion from Godzilla's explosion on the destruction of cities and people are what makes it good and the best film.  So in my opinion, the film Godzilla the New Empire is like an Ultraman film which doesn't care about the conditions of the CITY and PEOPLE.
Wooo King Kong you are amazing 🤩
Wow-_-
“EYY !! IF KING KONG MAKE 155….”
Ok this movie was goated and all but if at some point i don't see a remake of the infamous dropkick in this Monsterverse in the future i am going to cry.
The trailer doesn't do the film justice, it actually was better than expected. I hope this isn't the last instalment of either, Godzilla/Kong are cracked!
Trash movie. Cant remember the last time I had to sit through something this bad.
Like a epic monster rollercoaster ride! Not for the faint hearted...BE WARNED! ☠️
naruto and sasuke
This movie needed to 2 hours 30 minutes
bro need the next after this..how satishfy  im when the villian ape hit by 3 giant😌😌
The monster verse is getting out of hand and I am here for it 🔥
Fantastic movie,best installment so far ❤️👏
Who is who
Movie sucked…minus one is the one worth having then this Barney Godzilla horrible story horrible cgi horrible in all of the above. Americans are not how they portray them , poser story. This movie is minus one in all ratings, go ahead reply something clever but just like my opinion it doesn’t matter what your opinion is, the film sucks Kong d****😂😂😂😂😂😂😂hollywood is a overrated and overpaid joke
Bollywood should look and learn from Hollywood movies VFX ...❤
I can't begin to describe how horrible this movie was. The most expensive B movie ever made.
This movie was epic so many levels
Habe es gerade fertig geschaut war ein 10/10 😢❤😊😊😊😍😍  Diese Film muss 1 billion verdienen
I have a question  about  the hollow earth area, ,,were is the light coming from,  is it small sun  ?
W movie
Great movie! This one is going to be hard to top but I’m sure they will find a way. Godzilla and Kong movies just keep getting better. They will probably be making movies about them 100 years from now. They might even be fighting foes on distant planets by then.
This is King Kong x Godzilla x Pokémon x Transformers in one movie. Smh Hollywood is slowly dying.
La voy a ver ahorita
Soooooo boring with bad actors. You can tell it was full dei lol
So nobodys gonna mention why Doomfist from Overwatch is starring in a Godzilla movie?
Apple ripping off their customers I preordered the movie in 4k and upon release they switched it to HD.
Bro i see tinos slaap☠️☠️☠️☠️
Jesus save us look i see the statue of jesus the statue we not fall jesus protect us on evil
For a movie with such cool stuff... it's painstakingly boring.
really? a mixture of Planet of the Apes, Uncharted, Tomb Raider is turned to a zilla-kong sci-fi
I WATCHED THE MOVIE AND ITS SOOOO GOOD BELIEVE ME GUYS ITS ALSO A GODS ENDING AND KINDA SCARY
Just think what this could have been, if it was Japanese and only cost $15m.
Finally watched this movie. Love Skar King he beat Kong without being struggle
people here after watching movie?
How can this get more awesome
When you feel bad for a giant ape that has a toothache
Hot garbage
Is this movie available on Netflix?
Can't wait to watch Godzilla and Kong Recieving the award
Do they intentionally make the characters in these movies dumb, unrealistic and obnoxiously insufferable on purpose? Seriously, the last 3 movies in this series have had some of the worst characters I've ever seen.
Do they intentionally make the characters in these movies the dumb, unrealistic and obnoxiously insufferable on purpose? Seriously, the last 3 movies in this series have had some of the worst characters I've ever seen.
This movie was ALOT better than I thought it was going to be! It was actually kinda epic! 🔥
Why this is getting worst and worst if we talk about CGI and graphics Hollywood is doing something wrong with it why if we see the earlier movies 2000s the CGI was on peak while they don't have this type of technology.  DISAPPOINTED
bs movie
You want spoiler? Ultraman will help them😂
Pales in comparison to Godzilla Minus One...hollywood just needs to let go.
What a dumb movie.  The characters were all unlikeable over actors, and the CGI for Kong was like a college student designed it and animated it. 5 out of 10.
Should have been called Godzilla Kong the new fempire, lol. Skip all the boring stuff and just watch the fight scenes
بالسينمانا يوم الاثنين ١٣ مايو 2024/05/13 🦖🦍
This was truely the most horrible movie I watched this year. Lost 2 hours of time with that woke drivel. It is sooooo bad.
I watched ur yesterday
Best Movie ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
what a boring cliche movie
10/10 really enjoyed it
Never got as much excitement as i got watching the film❤❤❤ Epicccc🎉🎉🎉 Thank you all for doing this epic movie❤
CG IS Awesome 😎 👍 💥😍✨💙💟♥️❣️
Dope💯
Dont watch it unless you wanna waste your time. its boring af. Watch a lion documentary instead. Atleast youll learn something.
I swear to God, Godzilla Minus One is better than this movie. The graphics of Godzilla Minus One may be weak compared to this movie, but it excels in terms of the story, luxurious characters, no feminism, no sexual tension, no porno scenes, a dramatic movie and action the same time, and for your information, it was produced in Japan.
I would like to see the Great Apes fight against the Gargantuas.  Imagine a war between both monster species in the hollow earth!
Movie is amazing ❤
Watched the movie tonight, what i csn say its one of the most boring movies i've ever watch in my life
Hey Warner Bro's, If you really want to see how to make a Godzilla movie, watch Godzilla Minus One. Best Godzilla Movie ever made.
Sembra tanto bello quanto ignorante! 😂
Godzilla has power that has emerged for the first time and nobody ever knew he had those powers mothra Gave Godzilla the ulitimite power when she died in king of monsters ❤
Why do people keep greenlighting this trash?  I know the answer, but please stop already.
IS THIS A MOVIE I SHOULD WATCH TODAY . [WONDER]
IN GOING TO THE MOIVES TO WATCH IT
Question is will there be another movie after this cuz they ain’t enemies not more since they teamed up in the end an don’t wanna kill eachother
When come ?
nb
For me the most precious moment in the movie was the little Kong rescuing Kong and their bond .
Can anyone pls pin me
Hahahaha enquanto voces tao vendo trailer eu ja tou vendo o filme
just wondering who would win in that fight
Due to the success of Godzilla x Kong The New Empire, a new Godzilla x Kong sequel officially in the work 💪🏻  Monterverse continues 🎯
Who's after they confirmed Godzilla X Kong 3
GODZILLA IN THIS MOVIE WASNT SCARED OF NOTHING!! HE WANTED ALL THE SMOKE 💨
I'm a huge Kong fan since 2008. This movie was great but I don't know why majority people prefer Godzilla over Kong like whyyyyyy??? This movie story moving from Kong POV but still majority people rooting for Godzilla whyyy???? Even though Kong had more screen time but most of the people rooting for Godzilla?? Give Kong some respect please
Kong
Kong
Kong
This epic moment😊
Wao
Nah gidzilla would win easly
Can’t wait.
Do You think King Kong or Godzilla would join lord vortech in LEGO Dimensions
It doesn't seem interesting. Almost like the avengers.
GEORGE ?
Kong 2017: 🦍🏝️🌴 Kong 2024: 🌈🌈🌈
I have seen this film it is insane you need to watch it
I love this series, but Warner Brothers has turned Godzilla and Kong into super heroes.
Absolutely in  love with moster verse movies❤❤❤
Watched this 100+ times already even after watching the movie just to see the godzilla and kong's roar and the outro title music ✨️🔥
I went to the movie theater to watch the movie
Kong and Godzilla are sick but the dialogue is so awful even in the trailer so cringe
Que bosta !
Mini kong exist What about mini godzilla wait *realize*
This movie kinda overrated, kotm and gvk are way better
Daaaamn. I hate that I am so skeptical of social media these days. All I see are positive reviews for this movie in the comments. And so I feel as though they MUST have been altered somehow. Can someone confirm that this is indeed an awesome installment? I am a big Godzilla/Kong fan
1:23  lol
Kong died giving birth
What genius gave Godzilla a stegarsaurus head. Get with it man. Godzilla should have a large T rex style head you cinamatic jerks.
Godzilla: can i borrow ur atomic breath color? Shin godzilla: sure  Kong: i need a glove Thanos: there you go
Where to watch this movie
kekurangan godzilla warner bros itu suasana seakan penonton di dalam filmnya kurang dapat feelnya. Terlalu cepat perpindahan kameranya
ゴジラめっちゃ走ってるやん笑
GODZILLA x KONG VS. PLAYER 2'S GODZILLA X KONG WITH ALTERNATE COLOR COSTUMES
After Shin Godzilla and Godzilla Minus One, every Godzilla movie produced by hollywood is straight up jokes. Japan's production truly live up to its hype and truly terrifying way of portraying Godzilla
Why did they make pretty Rebecca Hall look so gender neutral?  Looking like a boy?  Some checklist DEI thing.
Godzilla is different now he bacame powerfull and powerfull like the nucleaar
Current worldwide box office stood at $546.9M 🔥
My opinion about the movie? It's very good, a 7/10 my opinion, the movie is really funny and action, but it has very problems in screenplay and connections. It's not a movie you need to think and forget the characters developments, it's shallow. So if you search a action movie with monster fights is the right choice. #GodzillaXKong
It was I watched it.
At 1:58 when Shimu uses his ice beam at Kong's axe, it sounds like someone is screaming into the microphone being like "WHOOOO!!!!".
This shi was so cornyy
Kong is probably the most fearless titan, any thing he sees he doesnt fear, even if he dies hes gonna fight ❤😊
Godzilla and Kong’s victory roar 2:52
Godzilla and kong: Our fight will be legendary.
Watched it. Looks more like Apes and Kong movie
This is going to be a great movie
ミニコングちゃんかわちぃ(๑╹ω╹๑ )
Minus one is faar better' than yhia
So I can't watch Minus One because of this trash smh 😞
Yep!
How long does it take to get Badfinger out of your head?, I don't remember.
Woulda been a 1000 times better if I didn't think I just saw the entire movie throughout the trailer.
Jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja really, really 😂😂😂😂 this so stupid. Only in Hollywood. I don't know why people love to live in a fantasy. I live in reality. Not in a bubble like other people. If you like this movie and you think it's cool you're one of them and you live in a bubble wake up there's more to life .
Is that the voice of Priyanka chopda😮
Top!
It’s literally may and the movie is not here
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
When Kong saw mothra he thought she was a flying spider because of how many legs she had💀
The audience at the theater where I just saw it, hated it. I was the only one in the theater.
Terrible movie. I just watched it a few minutes ago and my God it's awful. Like someone with ADD directed it or Chat GPT'd it. Truly couldn't wait for it to end...
Masterpiece i went to the cinema before and this movie is amazing 10/10 movie 🎥🍿
People enjoy this CGI vomit? Really?  The last good Godzilla movie was Godzilla Minus One.  This, this is just pure money dump trash in front of that.
Cool

Godzilla is a Black Body  Just the same as the beast in Revelation 13  So now u can  somewhat see what CERN has been so busy doing all these years with their "research"
Kong: Jarvis, engage !!!
Today I watched.. super movie
Godzilla: protectors of nature Also godzilla: *proceddes to destroy 2 bridges in .1 seconds*
အဓိပ္ပာယ် မရှိရုပ်ရှင် USA အဏုမြူဗုံးတွေ မြို့ကြီးတွေကို ဗုံးတစ်နဲ့ဖြတ်စီးနိုင်ပြီး မီးတောင်တစ်ခုဘဲရှိတဲ့ဒီအကောင်တွေကို ဘာလို့မဖြတ်စီးနိုင်တာလဲ😅😅😅
Seems like a bad movie
Can we get a movie of Shimo since Godzilla has like 3 movies and Kong has 1 and shimo has none whatsoever
I already watch the movie, and i beg u legendary pict. Give it back godzilla horror movie 2014😢. This film like power rangers😢 Im feel bad to watch this. Please give me a horror movie godzilla not this one

Overwatch x Godzilla collab🥰 doomfist Winston is op
😅I love this movie.go go godzilla keep it up my friend.
I thought that comments here are paid or bots as they sound like that, but we watched and its really amazing!
Why so much destruction?😢
so bad
i need movie of history'godzilla ,but that movie  was mix between godzilla and transformers
When will qe be able to watch it online
Can’t wait for the next movie, the next movie or installment is inevitable
1:52🥶❄️
Sorry...  When we have one monster powering-up as a Super-Saiyain and the other with a Thanos gauntlet..  You know the movie has problems.  Making a Monster-Verse movie to mimic Marvel avengers shows utter trash...  Godzilla vs Kong was better...
Anyone from Nepal or India 🙃😅
I still think godzilla 1954 is better and you cannot change my mind
Give kaiju universe a license🙏
This movie was hype. Kong with the POWER GLOVE!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They should buff kong
This aged like fine wine! 🍷🗿
SO. GOOD.
2:25
Ain't no way they went Winter Solider on Kong
0:14 The people who had their family and homes destroyed by Godzilla and Kong: 👁👄👁
See You next Monsterverse Film
Who actually  watches this shite 5 year olds😂
Finally Godzilla has big Arms
Cartoon godzilla when? The one thst looks like a xenomorph.
Deractarmass
Omg
Nice Upgrades Guys💪🏽💪🏽 Kong you got The Gauntlet and Godzilla you supercharged into Super Saiyan Rose Godzilla 😈😈😈😈😈 DOPE!!!!!!
ゴジラの超強化版が放つ放射線レーザーが全然相手にダメージを与えられてなかったのが不満でした。
godzilla became barbie😂😂😂
Wow
This will be best movie for the year 2024....
I love this movie when i was in cinema watch it it really epic
Who’s watching in 2024? 😂😂😂
Please, i just wanted to see giant monsters fight. Get rid of the humans please... PLEASE... And why does there always need to be this "portal to another world" none sense?? like really??? i may as well just watch Transformers.
I watched this movie yesterday it was ⭐️AMAZING⭐️
Up next for production, should have Godzilla, Kong, and Jet Jaguar vs. Megalon, Skunk Monster, and Monster Zero with the arrival of Gamera to back Godzilla, Kong, and Jet Jaguar.  Yesssss!
Not as much expected as from this movie kong was more  acting like a human being which was pretty much weird though and i wish Godzilla was more agressive and swift it was kinda disappointing smhw but enjoyed it😊
OMG SHIMOOOOOOOOO
Done watching today  the best Kong. Love this movie 💪
28/04/24
น่าดูมาก...

This is a 9.5/10 movie bravo second best to Kong skull island
I just watched this movie togethet with my wife.. we loved it ❤
$500M 💸🔥
Godzilla x Kong The New Empire made $500M at box office 💵🔥
That’s my type of movie ✌️ - ❤ from Pune
Só filme top muito bom super recomendo
Holy rise of the planet kong
Ok im sorry but why is the opening where she said that the century was harmony i literally have a flashback from Avatar opening
Man where is shimi
2:05  This is me when I wake up in the morning.
It's a pity that you spend so much money to make these movies, the script is bad, the music is weak, as if a 12-year-old kid wrote the script, repetitive characters, a naive black man, a charming and heroic white man, a girl hero who saves the world, a woman White-skinned single mother, self-made, stubborn and omniscient, that's enough, you are not tired of these repetitive scripts.🙁🙁🙁
The next movie should be called gxk vs Pacific ram ngl
War Of The Last Heroes 2024 July Legend Of Everfree The New Empire
I watching in cinema super nice story...it was story that full excitement thriller and creative effects,promise you love it...
It looks like one of those asylum films but with a bigger budget.
So I watched this last night. Why did your serpent have red meat? Shouldn’t it have had white meat like a fish?
Hey today I’m gonna be watching this movie in the theater at 4:10 PM or 7:10 PM my estimate is scary
Seen in cinema. Facepalm whole move. Take some beer to cinema for having much more fun. Looks cool, but feels like cringe 😆
1:41 best scene ever
I realised that king is thanos
This movie was so good 🤍🤍 Edit: this has to be the best King Kong and Godzilla movie yet
I thank god every day for having Millie Bobby Brown and her film family written out entirely out of this movie and instead added Dan Stevens into the mix. It was way more fun that way.
Thought it was much better than the critics were saying
I ❤ kaylee hottle. I wanna date her one day.
I saw this at cinemas today, new fav movie ✌️
1/10
Can you explain the biggest skeleton in that movie its really important than Godzilla and kong or it's opponent
Waiting for releas tv😂
Aliens! 🛸👽🌌
Who came back here after the movie ? 😅😅😅
That's going to be a cool movie
7/10 Too fast paced, worst final fight, skar king lame and never felt like a actual threat.
2029: Kong becomes bumblebee🎉🎉
The fact that they randomly added a giant fluffy moth thing to fill all the potholes and nobody is talking about it will never fail to astonish me..
Release date
This movie may kong movie
2:52 🔥
Translate to your linguage   Kong:eu sou...inévitavel Godzilla:KAMEHAMERA ROSEEEEEÉ
Best movie I love Godzilla ssg rose and thanos Kong
Greattt🎉
2:29 Cobalt😂
Missed the theatre play now have to watch on phone
Queremos o Godzilla e i Kong no Kaiju univers
This is going to be my favorite movie to watch until Nintendo announces there next system and Luigi's mansion 2 HD comes out when I watch this on digital
So Godzilla and King Kong will be fighting a different version of Kng Kong and Godzilla, 🤯
1:53
You've got your work cut out for you, because Godzilla Minus One is outstanding.
so ein Schwachsinn
Thought kong was bumble bee ngl
Kong look so goofy lol when he try to stop Godzilla from charging him
Keyifle izledim cidden de çok iyi bir video olmuş
Just saw the movie my favorite one of all❤❤❤❤
I liked the small kong at last ecene when he was on the shoulder of kong.
Ggygvbnjhgfgcefgtvexccfv  vg gv là một ❤loài ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
LOL THAT GODZILLA AND KONG RUNNING SCENE WAS SO GOOFY AND HILARIOUS I LOVE IT 😂😂😂😂😂
38M views for this empty spectacle, braindead entertainment? grow up idiots
SKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOONKK
They guy in the trailer is right. I have already seen it all before.
I need godzilla vs kong in octagon
This was so entertaining to watch ! Nothing more to say
watching this trailer made me think of them just being like hey then they both start like crouching like in games where people crouch to show there friendly lol
Just yesterday i saw the whooooole movie it was AMAZING🎉🎉🎉🎉😮😮😮
The little girl in the movie has the exact same about to cry expression on her face throughout the entire film, save for one scene where she is connecting with her tribes people.
Oi
Is this worth admission
Godzillanın gücü bildiğin 99 evrimleşiyorda
Adorei
10/10
Good ahhh movie
Just saw it, well, the story is perhaps too rich that can't be toned accurately. Many monsters but can't make the impact. The fight in last episode is much more attractive frankly. Yet, the scenes and sound effects are still attractive la. 😊
Just watched the film. If you ask me to rate it, I'll give it 9.5/10 the best film I watched in my entire life
I love IT😅
The worst movie ever
❤
Wow such a Pure childish and meaningless movie
Where is Behemoth?  We want to see Behemoth and his powers!
Kong win finally but after that what happen director forget to TOLD?😂🎉
This was good movie with Mayra
2:48 sheesh 😮‍💨
udah nonton ka di bioskop seru
I like the film!
This show is maybe 2 stars maybe
My brother wanted to see it so I went. One of those movies today. Its bad
Beginning seemed decent but quickly turned into a 💩 show. Movies are so lame now. The 90’s and early 2000’s were the best times for movies. Now they are a joke.
I just seen it in the theaters and boy is it fire I love it omg❤❤❤❤
Kong finds out he is not the last of his kind but godzilla knows he is the last of his kind (this is just a theory maybe in future movies a next godzilla shows up)
and here I thought this was just another fanmade show 😭
Who is here after the movie released?
How come I haven’t seen this trailer until now? 🤔🤔🤔
The lava godzilla in 2016 in the final moments against King  Ghidhora is coming again but in blue. It will be cool asf.
How did we go from something completely dark in 2014 to this ☹️
that sound made me thought the actual movie is a horror..
I swear kong is a huge version of kratos  😂😂😂
So if Godzilla a good guy? I though he is the villain…..
Isso vai ser uma porradaria das boas , slk
Godzilla and Kingkong joined forces? now watcha call em? GodKing?, KingGod, ZillaKong, KongZilla? i dunno...
Wow
2:27
s/o to that little orange monke, dude was chill
He ( Godzilla ) looks like Tyranitar bro ❤😂
This is skibiid Ohio fizz
I hate it when they dive into the new world. Making the story too complex. I'm not watching this movie
Sms very booooring no  anyone plz tell us how was it
2 more films and Kong will become the iron Kong. Also, when I saw the yellow metal from ground, thought it was bumblebee... I am a dumbass
WE NEED ULTRAMAN.. !
Do i have to wear the 3D glasses to watch it at the theatre? Those things give me a migraine
This is a cool cool movie. Woww amazing i hope next a new movie again
Apparently, Universal and Apple TV’s ‘Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters’, Skar King was referenced along with what I call “The Ice Titan”, or “Shimo”…. The “Signal” is the Call For War Against the SURFACE..!! The Titans, who were underneath the Earth for HUNDREDS of not THOUSANDS of years, aim to create a New Empire…. Kinda like how “Godzilla Earth” was…. With the Titans constantly destroying the Planet, Terraforming it into a New Empire for the Titans….
Is the movie called Godzilla vs kong or Godzilla and Kong Both are like Ronaldo and messi
Can’t wait to see Kong vs Kevin Durant
this trailer........it's all there.. what's left???
True
Any news about the queen of the monster
i am going to watch it in theater on Saturday
Ohhh yes I've got to get this movie 🎉😂😂😂❤
Just watched the movie! Shimo is Gorgeous!!! She is beautiful! ❤️
Lets be clear, 10 nuclear missles would destroy this ape and lizard...
My girl shimo is an destroyer
Continues making the Godzilla & king Kong series ♥️
I'm Indian i love King Kong movies 🤟🤟🌾🌾🚜🚜👌👌🇮🇳🇮🇳🌋💪🥸🥸🥸
Cheers for 10 years of Monsterverse Godzilla.
Nice 👍👍
I want to watch it and HOLY IT WAS AMAZING
Kong to thanos 😂
I love Kong🦍🦍🦍 and godzilla
I hope they make more movies like this
I went to watch it
2:23 bro never said that in the movie
so nice they did not spoil the defender of iwi in the trailer
I expected better after Godzilla Vs Kong this was meh
Name a website to download
LOL i just watched this movie...they're just looking for reasons for the monsters to fight now. 0 plot, 0 seriousness. This is almost like the Transformers franchise now....
This remake is better then all the orginal movies put together the other godzilla and kind kong moves are stale and boring
I loved this movie! The action scenes were brilliant, well done and gorgeous. The movie had lots of heart. The emotional scene at the end with the mother and daughter made me cry. Pretty good film
That's enough, isn't it over? If Godzilla sees Kong, he'll say that's enough, let's not fight anymore.
Seru film nya jgn lupa nonton
retwu nbnj oity giytu
those who’ve seen it, is there a lot of human narration or is it mostly focused on the monsters ? i wanna take my son but he gets bored easily lol
I know you will make a Godzilla/Kong Trilogy...but there also other monster that need to shine like mothra, and Rodan Biollante and Destroyah we love to se Godzilla Vs ???? Again not just King Kong all the time
Wow how many times are they going to keep making these movies? I have lost count
The feminist and lettered folk have managed to F up another set of movie icons.  This movie is loaded with feminist and lez tropes.   Definitely NOT a movie for kids on so many levels and for many obvious reasons.  NOT WORTH the watch...unless you hate masculinity and straight men.  NEXT!!!!
I could not believe that King Kong was riding shimmer.
That’s how you make a Godzilla x Kong movie.  Very impressive! Loved it! ❤ So excited to see it again!
Rusty rivets the movie trailer march 20 2029
Deer squad the movie trailer may 30 2029
Deer squad power of destruction  Rusty rivets power of creation
Deer squad power of destruction  Paw patrol construction
Rubble and crew is constraction pups
Deer squad power of destruction  Rubble and crew is constraction pups
OOOoooooookay. So. That's weird. A giant gorilla and a giant mutant lizard join forces to destroy like, their almost exact copies and it kinda works out. I love Godzilla, he's an absolute classic and Kong, yeah, i like him too but the fact that i just don't like apes and monkeys really doesn't help.
People will say, what did you expect, giant monsters, of course it's stupid. No, it didn't have to be stupid. The giant monsters means there's a larger danger of it being stupid which you should attempt to avoid.  Not put on a pair of goggles and dive in trying to reach the bottom of the stupid pit.
They only have one trailer for this?
wanna pet monkey now
Super Godzilla rose
Will they fight Shimo?
This movie was f***ing intense🔥🔥🔥🔥
Were can I watch this
Where can i watch it?😢
I watch this movie yesterday and i think this movie will award get the best film ever❤
noiceeeee I watched in the cinema very recently!!
The scene were they destroyed the pyramid of khufu is fake , i saw that pyramid yesterday
Godzilla: I’m To Old For This S••T. Kong: Get over It, I Need Your Help.
I will definitely be going to see this movie I grew up watching King Kong and Godzilla movies still a big fan
Can someone tell me in our near theatre they start it in Hindi or English?
*They don't have to like each other, they just have to work together." This reluctant team-up is gonna be hilarious! Can't wait for the buddy-cop vibes*
Release date
Hlkbjjlılk
What should I watch in this? Why this doesn't interest me? I want to watch movies of sci-fi genre but these days movies don't have the gravity.
But the film is  super
godzilla AND kong
If kaiju universe was still here the update would be sick
Seeing Godzilla and Kong running toward the Scar King in theatres really give me mad Goku and Piccolo vs Raditz vibes. I do love how even way back in the Hesei movies, the movies keep nodding Dragonball in some way shape or form.
Kong is aged now just like in Monarch: Legacy of monsters 😮
If I had dollar for everytime Godzilla and Kong team up to fight an enemy I'll had two dollars. Which isn't a lot but it strange it happened twice in a life time.
Kes kes nai ya movie dekha hai senifix mai comment karo ?
That movie was so good I watch it yesterday in theaters
Warner bros please tell adam wingard to make indian kaiju in godzilla vs kong 3 but not like villian like shimo hero
I cant wait to drink while watching this in the theater
Hope HBO max picks this up on streaming this was definitely good
Were can i watch it
I cant find it an Netflix
Imagine a Albion Titan with a purple crystal spear named Zeus in the next movie
Unpopular opinion: Looks amazing. Script: for 12 years olds maximum. If you older , nothing will make sense to you. Music: What ever is popular on YouTube for 12 years olds ..  Single -I was born for loving you . Feels so out of place… Every time Kong on Screen: you get God Of War vibes… Kong doesn’t feel like a giant ape anymore.  None of the apes act like an ape would do. They live next to lava (why would they) They doing something there (what ? God knows ) Scar king just a rip off monkey captain from ice age 4 ..  Godzilla : yes , every time it’s on the screen: looks awesome, why people attack him, struggling to understand.. If it’s so radioactive, It would burn and melt everything on its path or in what ever direction wind blows..But again if you are 10 years old , you just not going to care .  Human actors : Prime example of Epic miscast. They just don’t belong there ..  Humans generally act stupid in this film(no actors fault, bad script).  Verdict: Unless you are a man-child or you take your kids to see it, don’t waste your time.
As a great Ape lover,  Kong is the only reason. I was mildly annoyed that they make him seem weak but he's the greatest ❤😊
Did kong got the Infinity gauntlet? From Thanos?  What incompetent producer suggested a robot arm?
they make it and it works! it has only big monster fighting eachother and a few bad jokes thats it!
They're friends now
Well Hollyidiots destroyed another franchise
These movies are great because they're ridiculous and fun.
Ima go watch it now        Fr
Just watched the movie today and gaddamnnn it was pretty fire can't lie
l
❤❤❤❤❤❤ 11 out of 10. No toxic, no complicated things, logics, simple and stunning! Kong is the best🎉🎉🎉
❌️ king Kong ✅️ Thanos
godzilla got a gender change now he is female
0:31 shimo
Yusiffffff
Where is Ultraman ?
Oh boy, they gave Kong a power fist.
.
2:08  Their run isso goofy Lmao
I saw the movie with my friends.. it was amazing bro
godzilla x pacific rim would be sick
movie looks like cartoon
disappointed that fist better than sequel
Greatest GodzillaxKong ship movie of all time
there are scene that I love that sadly didn't make into the trailer .... Godzilla now have perfectly new bed 😂
fking BS another huge flop
Hollywood telling the world about WW3  to come. Indeed a New Empire is on the Rise. The Fall of USA and the Rise of Israel, the last Babylon Empire
done watching. superb movie.👏
Imagine if there was a Monsterverse film where all the Titans battle against an enemy army.
So anxious to see it
There are many duos that I love: Invincibubble and Mister Superawesomeness (The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (2015)) Or in other words, SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star Gumball Watterson and Darwin Watterson (The Amazing World of Gumball) Finn and Jake (Adventure Time) and many more.  But how awesome can Godzilla and Kong be as a duo!?!? 🤩
Coisa boa
I keep getting audio rendered restart PC error
I just left the movie theater earlier today and I loved Godzilla X Kong The New Empire. It is my favorite movie out of the franchise so far historically.
Godzilla just turned into a purple giant 😂
മലയാളിക്കു ഇവിടെ വരാം 🔥🔥
This movie was amazing
Não conheço o universo do Monsterverse, então não sei se o Shimu apareceu nas HQs, e muito menos a informação do gênero dele na HQs. E sinceramente, prefiro que ele seja um personagem novo, porque se canonicamente ele for macho, então atitude dos roteirista de colocarem ele fêmea é repugnante.  Se futuramente vazarem quê só colocaram ele fêmea Pelo simples fato da Lore do personagem ser que ele deu a origem aos Titãs/ evolução do Godzilla. ("melhor"), por causa de agenda política. eu não ia ficar surpreso, afinal, já vazaram tantas coisas bizarras dos roteiros quê geralmente está atrelado aos militontos quê é assustador.
Not good to watch
😮omg
GodzillA ❤️🖤 emotional my fvrt
Nobody told me nothing !
When Gojiras nuke ramps up it is the most beautiful sound 😊
Stupid
Is this movie PG?
Ok I watched it , The CGI is kinda worst, same as GVK but the monster fight is good.  One suggestion, bring back the directors of G14 and Kotm , and remove the current director, he sucks
Goku and vegeta fight against zamasu and black goku   It gonna be epic 😊❤
Best Kong ever!
i hope WB make #GAMERA film too... please......❤❤❤❤❤
I hope there is no connection with a another women or a human. That i dont care about All i want is destruction, not kong with his human girls
1:46 best part bruv
Lizard in the monkey’s shadow…
I don’t know if Dune of this is the most Cinematic
JIA THE DEAF GIRL IS STILL HERE YAAAY
For centuries there was Harmony, then everything changed when fire nation attacked
This is what u can do to fix your mistake of killing off 2 amazing titans Scylla and Tiamat. Replace them with another 2 badass looking ones
This is elite
This movie was literally  Big Monkey with stormbreaker  and infinity gauntlet teams up with Kaioken Lizard to fight Ginger Monkey with a belt and frosty the snowman’s pet dog    I never said I didn’t enjoy the film
This franchise could of been on the level of “Planet of the Apes” but they just had to add the cheesy (kid with powers) bullsh*t and the corny black dude who is desperately trying to be funny but is NOT!!!
Love the Dragon ball Z references  The great apes reference   An I believe it was said that Godzillas new red energy is inspired from gokus koi-Ken an is a temporary boost in power for the lizard
Going into this blinds was great
Watched it on cinema 😉cant get over it
Godzilla has a new beam its a purple one
Jia is the quite kid in her school
5 minutes into the movie I smell a foul stench of wokeness. Elizabeth Homes comes out frm a successful Ted talk talking nonesess felling like she's the smartest person in the world, she has a daughter of a different race which doesn't make sense and visits a nobody to ask for advice concerning the fate of civilisation and to add salt to injury, her daughters stupid drawing resembles a chart from their highly sophsiticated equipment? who writes these rubbish? where are all the strong women? why all these writings and portrayal in recent movies all written by childish immature or possibly mentally ill person? and u give 101 excuses why cinema tickets are going down after Covid? I walked out of cinema 5 times in the past 3 years, can u guess why your cinema tickets are down?
A mini Kong!! Since they introduced this child, they prolly gonna kill King Kong in the next part😭. Please don't do it😭😭
I just seen the movie and it’s fire
Make gigan and megalon in godzilla movie
King Kong wears a glove? is it that comic book glove?
I allready watch this movie 🗿
Suko X Doug: The Young Empire
The Greatest Titan ever pinned
I watched Godzilla x kong a new empire on Waimea theater
Love this movie
Der Film war leider nicht gut
Godzilla minus one on a $15 million budget far superior to this utter stupidity
Best exapmle of degradation of fantasy movies... so sad wasting my time to watch this trash
WHOS HERE AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE?  👇
2:48 2:53
Saw this on big screen absolutely loved it.. just as fan of Godzilla I want 2014 godzilla the horror and chills that movie gave me was on another level  And to be honest after watching gxk at home I watched again Godzilla 2014 on my projector and still gave me that horror chills and vibe...😊
Saw this yesterday, it’s more of a Kong movie , also there’s no end credits so no need to sit for 5 to 10 minutes waiting on nothing .
Simply Exceptional movie 🎥.. What a picture It was !!! Just finished it watching.. probably one of the best movies I have watched so far❤ All Five stars to You 🔥
Better than the other one they made !!!!!! 😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
Trailers are the worst. Its 90 percent of the movie lol
Godzilla Minus One is the best Godzilla movie I ever watched.
godzillaxkong
if only they didn’t make the last few movies so corny with the unfunny jokes… the movies could’ve been even better if we kept it serious like godzilla 2014 was
2:52 roar
I HAVE THE FULL MOVIE
Like if you love Godzilla and King Kong and want to see more movies of them both!
I m waiting for 300 rise an empire next part 😢
if shimo  dosent get male imma hate  legendary
Completely over top, there is no valid story
WHY IS GODZILLA STILL ATTACKING KONG?! AH, ITS SUCH A CHILD!
Dude this movie was actually so good
Damn bro that's crazy
I have watched the movie the movie was superb the vfx was insane and how they explain kongs story that was great 10/10❤
Godzilla and Kong, assemble 2:05
I don't know any of these actors, other than some of them being actors from the previous movies that i didn't know then.  Also i feel like the cgi was better in the last movies.. why make it worse for this one? These two aspects put me off, otherwise i hope it manages to somehow be epic as it should be.. I just wish they didn't backtrack in those ways ..
Watched the movie really average… CJI was sloppy
Team part 3  👇
Is Godzilla turning into a transformer
We took our kids to watch this the other day and they loved it.
I will be honest. After watching this, I would say this is by far the best ever collaboration of Godzilla, Kong, and Mothera working together to fight their foes.  Trust me, this movie is beyond expectations and good 👍.
Kids will love it. Not meant for adults. I'll definitely pass.
I like how they didn’t include mothra in the end so no spoilers
so in the last movie the monkey and the lizard were at each other's throat and now they are fighting something else together? :D
This is stupid  Why not get the avengers and Dominic toreto to save the world
Love the part where they both were running like they were afraid of something
I have watched finally.Big fan of monsterverse . Really awesome to watch in 3d
How bout make a film with Kong and Godzilla vs. Cloverfield and Pacific Rim. That'll be cool.
Propably the best movie I’ve watch so far this year. Kong acting skills was lit 🔥
I can't wait for this. This is gonna be the movie of a year.Yes it happened😃😃
Isn't the cgi bit sloppy
Is that a mimi kong?
hey Kong y
Underrated movie🔥
HE JUST THREW A MFING BUILDING
Watching from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Ive watched it today,ITZ REALLY GOOD!!! YOU PUT MANY DETAILS😃😃,i likehow the blood changed to greeny liquid things
Mothra in the trailer: 🫡
Kong got that thing from fallout no way.
That was a super giganoto-sized tooth...super giganoto-nice job.
And in the statue scene shimo's shots her/his atomic frosty breth...super nice job.
Oh and while godzilla and kong play tag😂 kong has a silver sharp tooth...nice job for that too.
In the explosion scene, some other titen is in there, well...of course scar king caused the explosion and also godzilla is fighting shimo...nice job.
Kong and Godzilla look great, but every bit of dialogue that came out of a humans mouth made me cringe with 2nd hand embarrassment.   Why can't they right smart likeable characters in these $200 million movies?
So then who is KING 👑of all MONSTERS? 🤔
Super 💯😬
Looks wack
Pretty silly movie, watched it. I did not make anything of the story or the sequence.
Watched it. Loved it! 👍❤😁
Ah yes my favourite movie, groudon x kyogre
2024 and it looks horrible.
Been waited for 3 years and was nearly a week ago when I watched this movie and for the first time IMAX 3D experience.. seeing this monsters on giant screen was literally an amazing experience.. visuals were super stunning.. 360° rotation on particular scenes was giving me an atmost roller coaster ride.. sound effect in IMAX was literally like a buzz bomb🔥 u can actually feel the resonation.. yeah the main talk about storyline of the movie was pretty ok.. mostly they only focused on Kong's plot and hollow earth world where else godzilla was given less screen time.. antagonists like scar king and shimo weren't as strong as protagonist so it was an easy fight win for G&K.. mothara's appearance was literally a wow.. but overall I actually enjoyed this one hope they could come up with more different plot and monsters in next one.. just can't wait to watch
I’m Going To See It Soon!
I wathc it yesterday in cinema it's true
and the last movie is godzilla vs destroyah
I’m going to go see it today
I want the next movie of godzilla x kong Will be godzilla x kong vs biolantte
I am indian👍👍👍
Why do the human characters ruin the film? Everyone. Except Minus one. That one was perfection.
It’s definitely a movie of all time.
It looks boring!
After watching Godzilla Minus One, this movie looks like utter garbage! lol
Saw tthis the other day its only alright just mostly animation not as good as the last godzilla
yo
I've never been so much fan of such movies but this movie looks so different and the graphics seem out of this world
I watched this in 4dx it was soo goodd
What was really horrifying about this movie is the actors & the writing .  A Boy liking this movie would be Monsterous . 😊  I don't recommend taking any  normal kid  or anybody you like
kong version transformers 😮
Seen today...it sucked...the Kiss and Loverboy tunes didn't help the movies cause either.
Amazing movie 10/10 just don’t watch this in I max if you have sensitive hearing 😭
Looks good
Right now, who is watching trailer 2, after watching trailer 1 a few minutes ago.
Landkruzer P.1000 ratte!
2:43 like an ironman hand
am i only one who don't know this !!
Just watched this on cinemas so cool
Going to watch on Monday
Wow They appeared in Brazil
Rilis sudah😊😊😊😊
I  gotta say that this is one of the best monsterverse movies I've ever seen!
Watched this masterpiece 3 times at theater ✊🏻🔥
Anyone know what order to watch the kong and Godzilla movies
Already watched it twice 😊 Team Godzilla
By the way the small sphere thing in the middle is mothra ,sorry for the spoilers edit: im wrong they actually removed mothra from the image but she was there in the movie
Now the King Kong Franchise & the Godzilla Franchise got a epic crossover!😮😮😮
Godzila PUBg
i missed watching this😢 i like watched it on april 6 2024/saturday😭 i missed it already why???😭 /i watched it on moa cinema😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Godzilla
I see full at ca...l app
Another goosebump!
Godzilla fans like Kong fans comment  Lets see who is winner
No need to fake-destroy one of the 7 world wonders. Unreal. Not necessary, looks like a good movie but… not this is just not necessary!
Never thought I’d see Kong get Godzilla with pocket sand🤣
I thought Godzilla with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor was boring. Will I like this one? Like is it more exciting?
Avengers goes to far they even become an animal
Godzilla x Kong : Iron Kong
Went and saw this today !!!!!! I have to see it again that evil ape was incredible
They need ultraman
At present Legendary Kong and Godzilla become human😂 they forgot that they both are giant monsters.
Trash
Mothra 🥰
mid asf….. i would give it a 6
Good fun
Flop,..
Best movie 100000000/100000000
this looks SHITE!!!!
just watch it
I cant believe i can be in tears, and gigglles, and clapping when watching monsters doing monsters things.
Film yg luar biasa melihat pertarungan terbaik di abad ini
Just watched it on IMAX and had a blast
Pink looooooooool tf
l asked Adam wingard if baby godzilla could be coming to the MonsterVerse and he immediately dove into his love of godzilla vs Destoroyah' he wants to capture the same emot ones of that movie in his next Gxk sequel.  Godzilla vs destoroyah 2026 surely
Can get this bgm ? Name of music ?
Another one...
Just watched it in the cinema, it was so good!!
Just watched it today in 3D, it was great all round but just the thing I didn’t liked was ending , it was too flat , what I mean is that they killed the monkey too fast in end , wasn’t satisfying , I rate it 8.2/10 ❤
This isn´t a movie, this is but a CGI Techdemo.
Ahh this is going to be sick 🥹😆
who watch this?
Mini Kong, -2, resemblance to Planet of the Apes, -1.5.......6.5, maybe.
Yes please
Adam wingard doesn't use properly entire Godzilla sequences in GodzillaxKong movie
I watch the movie yesterday and its really cool and awesome
It was extremely epic
This film is incredible!  It not only contains massive action, but also brings the drama, both done very well.  I was impressed with the Lore, as well.  As we all are all thirsting for more Lore, and not just human drama - a la the Gareth Edwards film and King of the Monsters.  This one brings the Lore quite well, serving as connective tissue.  The A plot is the basic plot, and is easy to follow.  The crown jewel is the B plot, which is Kong finding his home, and you'll have to see it to appreciate it.  And there's a C plot that hits surprisingly heavy, with Rebecca Hall's character.  The action is a bit PG-13, but satisfying for all ages.  But there's even an effective D plot with the Iwi people of Hollow Earth connecting to Ancient Egypt.
Just watched this film, Kong & Godzilla are still adorable, plus superCUTE Mini Kong cute but the human characters are quite tedious, esp the IWI queen.
I saw the movie today and I love it. ❤️❤❤❤❤🌟⭐️🌟⭐️🌟
Went to see this today. Great movie ❤️
Godzilla final wars
*wars
It reminds me of final wrs
After seeing it
I wach it in movie
Godzilla minus Zero was better.    this movie spent too much time on Kong and the human characters were all cut-outs from comic books.   All of them insipid - and annoying, especially Brian Tyree Henry, with Dan Stevens a close second.   Movie would have improved is these characters had been killed in the first 30 min.
im seeing this tmr 🎉🎉
Obrigado meu prefeito, por esse filme 🎉
I am seeing thissss😮
Godzillas footprint was as big as the Colosseum 2 films back.   Why did they scale down Godzilla to the 6-7 story Kong size..   ??  Ha ha  this mash up was wrote on whiskey with Disney Kids for bartenders.
sira
They moving as fast as Marvel Super Heroes now lol
Js saw the movie yesterday it was the best movie ever 😁😂❤❤ I can't wait till it releases out on Netflix movies anywhere and all the stuff u can watch on!!!!😅
Movie link plz ??
I just saw the whole movie😊
awful
They dont have to like each other they have to work together. Like UK, USA and USSR during WW2.
i already watch it and it was incredibal i want to see more godzilla and kong movies!
Bro the king kong and godzilla trailer is 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥
Nissan GT-R x Kong😱
Maybe im not in the majority but i feel like from godzilla vs kong onwards, monsterverse got that forbidden pacific rim 2 effect, giant things moving too fast, but also got that inconsistent size problem
Looking scary 😊
Money grabbing quick buck making😂😂  How to make 2-3x in 1yr
Great movie!!
Shin Godzilla:Nah' I'd win
wb absolutely cooked🔥🔥🔥
Anjayyyy
Godzila ka kya ma bahan kar diye ho😂 pahale wala extremely powerful tha like burning godzila
Its seems,like the next enemy should be the sister of the god of mosnsters🧐
I have watched this moive in IMAX 3D dude the experience is just phenomenal. I recommend to watch this into a moive theater. You will experience the thrill
This was trash. Minus one blew this one away. Worst movie I’ve seen in decades
First time in a while that me and the kids left a movie thrilled about what we saw.   The humans sucked like always in monster movies but wow were there MONSTER non stop.  A good chunk of time with no human dialog and it's awesome!
Japan's ragtag lizard Godzilla is overrated by an idiot director
Beat movie I’ve seen this year so far. 10/10.
I want to see shin godzilla also in the next godzilla movie
Just got back from seeing it!  Here at movie!!!
I watch yesterday at cinemas
Cat&Goku
Monke
I watched this today in the cinema 3D and 4DX it was so cool!! Totally recommend it ❤
CGI is getting worse year on year. Compare this to Peter Jacksons King Kong and you would think this came first
please lien downlod
Tell me why The King Of The Monsters is PINK ???!!!!!
Ask me what's my fav duo and I would say Godzilla and kong in a heartbeat without any hesitation , no matter how old i get 🗣️🗣️🗣️
un film di merda
If You see a titan, if You see him walk, If His yellow arm grabs the pyramid, If He growls and screams, then that's not Kong, that's your boi Devastator from Revenge of The Fallen. 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
top tier movie
Gonna watch this in 4DX
There should be a movie with just titans Who agrees?
Opp
🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
🦍🦍🦍
The villains were wasted in this movie, especially scar king.
Bunch of fake comments! the movie is absolutely terrible
I watched it last night in 3D, and it was awesome!
I thought it was great I gave it a 8/10 I do think it lacked was the bad guy mechgodzilla was a better baddie.
GODZILLA will always be the best!
I like it 4/5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟 Go and watch now.
I saw it today and it's simply wow 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 and  want to watch it twice❤❤❤❤
Bahut bekar movie hai dekne layak nahi hai
its good, 7.5/10
These giants caring about humanity is like human caring about insects. 😂 Mainstream  Movies these days relies too much on cgi and action than the plot of the film. These film will never come close to Peter Jackson's kong films.
wait... Godzilla can be *afraid?*
0:30 you can see Mothra
Kong x Thanos
What..Thanos turn into kong😂
Godzilla vs Kong Godzilla and Kong Godzilla weds kong Godng vs kozilla ...........
Please Collab again with  Pubg mobile
Godzilla has become Black Goku and Kong Thanos
Watched the movie yesterday at theater and wanted to watch it again on repeat
No one else thinks this is ridiculous?
Lots of cheesy hippy jokes but besides that Great action packed movie
Nice movie… ..but I wonder why they never say ……even in the opening line “we were wrong about the age of the universe or oh the universe is not only the Milky Way when this axiom was actually established by the scientific world and disproved. But they always say  “we believed that we are the only species and we are wrong” while this was not even established the scientific community. We need to compare apple to apple and not orange to apples
Again come godzila 😢😢pubg
Godzilla me
I went to the movie and I saw it the mine long was soo cute
Nowadays, children live a dream life!
This movie was awesome
We coming me and tilda
Great movie
That was an epic movie with 3D glasses! That and the Wonka movie stick out most to me so far this year.
*Cringe.*
both of them running is actually funny and cool.😂😎
Film je totalno ludilo
Worst VFX ....
Seneng banget nih gua ama ni universe
Sadly the cgi looks horrible.
Absolute masterpiece
John 3:16 God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son whoever shall believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Believe in jesus to be saved.
Superhit❤
Everybody can feel it 😂
Flop movie
Imagine having Jaegers, Godzilla and Kong together fighting them. Damn!!
If I was a gambling man.  I put my money on Godzilla.  Let's get #cooking
i already watch it
All the previous king and Godzilla movies were good, this looks horrible
truly great movie!
Adil
You don't really need to pay attention to the story. Just watching the titans banging on the big screen is fun enough.
Mama watching it now
Warner Bros. announce a new film Justice League in Action release date cinematography 03 May 2024 in United States.

Best Godzilla movie till date
Is it me or the other godzilla is space godzilla
Can’t wait to watch it this is gonna be epic! 😎
Is the shimo guy real
Bored with same drama. Please try something new bro.
Sitting through this would give me a headache and make me grumpy
This movie was kinda entertaining.....but had many wholes in its story.....  1. If Godzilla is humanity's savor....why was he being attacked??  2. If Godzilla was humanity's savor...why did they have epic battles which destroyed many properties and killed lots of humans.   3. Why was that red monkey scar....so hard for Kong to beat, kong was 4 times his size and had that arm thing.....while scar was a scronny, old, beat up, chewed up ape.   4. They made Kong look old with gray hairs....lol.    .....the rest of the story was kinda..."whatever" but ok..😮😂😂😂😂
King solo movie pls WB
I think Godzilla and Kong needs the incredible hulk
2:27 "Signature punch of Kong 👊🏻❤‍🔥"
Sei que você estava procurando esse comentário em português.
Im watching this movie tomorrow 🎉🎉🎉🎉
at the start, I thought Optimus Prime was coming out too
Movie for kids😂😂
wtf 😂😂😂😂
This movie was an absolute masterpiece. I enjoyed every minute of it and I must admit that the movie felt really short (that is how good this movie is)
Next movie he rolling with ultra instinct😂
Another movie that’s just a combination of aspects from better movies, shameless cash grab
un bras en fer )) bientot l 'auto kong la kalash  kong lol  et pourquoi pas ...lgbt kong dans  kong  s 'enfile un god.....zila
This movie is an very savage insult to the audience of movies and cinema since the beginning, and should be punishable by law.
Looks 💩 tbh
Off yeni serüven başlıyor ❤❤❤
"is that a mini-kong???"
The CGI on these is getting worse and worse lol
Godzilla and Kong on one screen This is going to epic again
Looks tedious
ive seen it in the cinema 🎥 1:17
OH COME ON. Is that the new "wild avengers" or what ? Why not let the computer make the whole movie ? Looks like a PS5 hit
Wow the trailer is so awesome ❤❤❤
Kong got the infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved super sayin rose this is gonna be epic
I love wb movies ❤❤
I usually root for Godzilla but Kong indeed a titan version of young man, an intelligent titan which is loved by many!
The 3D was AWESOME
Why do they make an enemy out of Godzilla and he appears only at the moment of battle even though the film was made about 2 titans starring Kong
Great fun movie if you loved the previous one.   ONLY downside was Godzilla needing more story and screen time, seemed Kong got most of it.
Best movie in the world 😮
Stupid Movie... Fully Boaring one 😢..  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY & TIME TO WATCH THIS ILLOGICAL MOVIE 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🥶🥶🥶😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵😵😵😵😵🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿

Best movie of the century
Adam Wingard/Legendary/WB, hear me out! Lets go Ball's out on the Sci-Fi, i'm thinking Xziliens, Gigan, and maybe even Destroyah! Alien race invasion storyline could be really interesting in bulking up the Human Side Story!
Meh
Mau nonton tapi takut sedih, paling g bisa nnton hewantm2 tersakiti bgini😭
warner needs to make a scooby doo live action 3
Note ***Brazil was wiped off the map after this movie after filleting
I'm glad I didn't watch this trailer. It revealed a little too much.
Make final trailer
Shimo 🙏🔥🔥🔥
Greatest of all time 🔥🔥🔥
THE RUNNING SEQUENCE WAS SO DOPE LOLLLL MY THEATER WAS SUPER HIGH ENERGY AND CLAPPED AT EVERYTHING!!! WATCHING IT AGAIN!!!
im tired of all the cliche sequences depicted in these trailers.  the first 2 of the more recent Godzilla movies was plenty. And then we were given Godzilla Minus One, which is an absolute masterpiece. thats enough for me.
ki-ki-ki-ki-king kong
I was actually what are the first ones to watch the movie!
I thought when Godzilla turned red he was evil😂
why would anyone watch this and ruin the film for themselves, honestly sad.
AVENGERS X DRAGONBALL HERO😁
Nah now simu frostbite Godzilla 💀
The movie was epic! I love how the previews didn’t show much and it surprised us in the theaters.
Awful as always. At least I didn't walk out of the cinema this time, but did laugh the entire time.
Mass❤
It's a 8/10 for me. Good action.
I love this kong than my wife❤
इ
Very entertaining movie but little bit disappointed with the climax fight because it was small in terms of duration please make a atleast 2 hour 15 min Or 10 minute movie because we have lost 10 minutes to the end the credits
What a Movie can't explain
Godzilla was unhinged this movie. Like needs time in the titan insane asylum and anger management after that
Kong- I am inevitable
Ithh anthinn kolam 😏
chimpanzee better
It may not be a good movie but if you love Avatar, then this movie got to watch 😊
Typical day in NY Subway
I watched this movie yesterday and thats really amazing
it was awesome would watch it again in ott 💯 a feast to WB heads
Just watched this on IMAX!❤
Emocionante , surreal
Movie was real good ... go see it
One of my favorite power-couples out there in action, what a day to be alive!
Mini Kong got his Frist kill tho
poor animation its good film for children
Kong defeats scar and godzilla evolved. Shimo becomes the pet of kong. Scar hurt kong hand so that’s why his hand is in an iron glove 🥊. The fighting was good but the movie was 💩.
The movement is just aint it, too fast, doesnt feel heavy, and unrealistic( i know its fiction😑).they need to bring back the 2014, 2019 style
Both purchased royal pass
Ale fajne
What a stupid white movie 😂😂😂
Best movie to I see... Its cool
in this movie  shimu in
I don't understand why the monarch characters aren't in this movie
Watch the movie the battle scene is much more better than other Godzilla movie and it epic !!🤯
Colossol!
I could of saw this yester day  but I don't regret it because me and my are the only boys in the house we have a special and I could have saw it but I chose something because me and my mum watch goodwill movies and king Kong movies

Godzilla❤
I like this movie. This is a good action film.
Somehow this trailer doesn't do it justice, it was 10X MORE AMAZING in the theater I swear
This will be epic
ehy in every movie the concept of time travel, multiverse is essential??
just watch this last day. Hoping for more exciting battle
Skar King's teeth fell out 🤣🤣
Imagine if YouTube reply
So many goosebumps while watching this movie! 🍿
the 2v2 was peak
If possible, the next film will be King Ghidorah
CONGRATULATIONS  ON THE  HUGE SUCCESS  TO THE TEAM OF GODZILLA X KONG THE NEW EMPIRE
Why is Godzilla so fast and quick?  Also why is Godzilla so friendly?
Sponsor by kotex
Its fun to see that the girl knowing kong is in here also
I saw the movie on Opening day.  If you're looking for a story rich movie with depth and pretty much everything Minus One had to offer.. stay faaaaaaar away from this.  But if you're ok with some decent CGI (which should be better considering the Monsterverse's Rep with VFX)  And giant monsters butting heads and doin suplexes and pummeling each other with Kong becoming an adoptive dad. then you're in the right place!
I noticed something. In the trailer skar kings tooth comes flying from the left side of the screen but in the actual movie his tooth comes flying from the right side of the screen.... Idk I'm weird I always notice things like that
i hate it cgi too obvious
Went and saw this with a friend today. Very good movie. Cool to see King Kong and Godzilla busting heads once again
Diddy(Godzilla) x 50cent(King Kong) when they use to want to kill they dont have to like one another now they must work together.. the new empire (black)......
Don't waste your money and time. I watched yesterday 2.5/10
And make sure you can more for free for free
Hey what's going on with Roblox counseling are you doing Roblox more more than your characters I just want to stop for you Ninja turtle Roblox
Most of the scenes with humans are boring.I liked alot of the conflicts that Kong had with other creatures.Not enough city destruction but it still has a few good action scenes.
I'm in on this movie solely bcos of Dan Stevens. Now when's The Guest 2 happening???
Why this dont got english caption🤔
Release date pleas?????
Godzilla ❌ , Zilla ✅ 🗿
The movie was disappointing. The animals looked more like cartoons than real creatures. I'm glad it was only 1 hour and 55 minutes long. I used to feel fear when these characters appeared in their movies, but this one was just like watching cartoons—no feelings. After 45 minutes, I left the theater.
For A Moment' We Everyone Really Cant Deny Our Mind To Think That This Everything Isn't Real   Uts VFX GUYS 🤐🫥🫡
Jel pianirate da izdaje jos jedan king Kong ili to je kraj
Where can i watch ut?
I think Godzilla should be told by Japanese people. Appreciation exists for both, but American adaptation, somehow, seems different from authentic Japanese Godzilla. Btw, it seems like Kong's size has significantly increased, almost 4 times bigger than before. He used to kick Godzilla's knee with his height. What happened to that lol.
2:04 Whoever created this scene deserves a raise!
Its like Warner Brothers are just going to ignore Godzilla-1 even exists and keep on churning out sh7t films! 🙄🙄
Olağanüstü bir film
The one ape reminds me of Sean Bean
Kong got the infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved super Sayian rose. This is gonna be epic.
I really prefer the Godzilla to be the main axis of movie. Monster movies don’t need to be too anthropomorphic
WHY AND HOW IS BRO PINK NOW?
Phim hay lắm mn đi coi đi
Godzilla has been my favorite forever! The the part where he lets Kong live 😂
İzlədiyim filmlər arasında bəlkədə ən həyacan verici film di.
Очень хочется посмотреть фильм на большом экране.графика супер
Tek kelimeyle harika bir film izlenmeli

Çox təsirləndim hətta bir az qorxulu gəldi
MONKEY
Film is rubbish. Loved the others but the feminists have gotten hold of yet another film. Men in it are blubbering fools and all the females are the sharp ones in the know. Kong has been too humanized and Godzilla is pink smh
This storyline is getting outta control and im all for it
Fragman çok iyi filmi mutlaka izleyeceğim
Classic movie two big thing fighting each others, i love it
This film super. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

🎥💎💎💎🤍✨   📌 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The trailer just showed me the entire movie, nice
Who came here after watching these movie on the theatre ❤😊
WATCHED IT IN DA MCL THEATRES
Surprised 😯
I just watched the entire movie yesterday
Totally over the top. All this kind of movies are the same.

Movies are getting lame by the year
I wish humans could use huge big robots like in pacific rim
tired of these animated movies too much cgi
Top quality movie, especially if you been a fan of both Godzilla and King Kong franchise over the years!
*If you can suspend your disbelief for this movie's run, you'll see lots of staggering CGI, a bit of convoluted talking about 'the inner' earth and 'the surface', how Godzilla and Kong musn't meet and then some folkloric nonsense about Mothra uniting the portals of both earths. If that sounds like a fairly big stretch of nonsense in itself, that's because it is. The sound in the cinema was completely overwhelming (and I'm not a senior citizen), pointless and farcical (maybe the kids are sensitised to it). There's also a young, hip doctor who insists on blaring awfully trite music out of his sound system (apparently the 70s had the best soundtrack). I like a very wide range of musical styles, but his were the nadir of choices to make. It was a godawful test of the will to endure this movie, but I got a free ticket (thankfully) so my ride was there loving it, so I was bound to my seat. I felt like Alex in A Clockwork Orange when he was forced to watch unbearable atrocities in the aims of making him violently ill. And that's no understatement. When it ended, I felt the joy of a prisoner being released to unrestrained freedom. But if you enjoy prison for a couple of torturous hours, then this is for you. But don't say you haven't been warned ... cause you have*
Really wanted to like this but seeing Kong with a gauntlet really took me out. Not to mention the villains look absolutely terrible!
－１からのゴジ×コン IQワダツミ作戦最高だな！
Godzilla and kong should be in the oscars
They upsized kong so much over the years its ridiculous 🤡
kong having a brawler gauntlet makes the most sense. having his strength and not being hurt from it is broken, especially for him. i’m guessing it does more than just protect his hand but if that’s was only the case it’s still cool, his axe was cool though wonder what happens to it .
Me la vi en 4d y fue una exeperiencia incleible
Godzilla kicks all including Kong ffs. Time to team him up with the army to defeat the baddies
I love the little kong and the robotic hand and the epick battle
Silly nonsense
Even Disney can't ruin this
Iron man kong 😭
I’ve never really been interested in these movies but my friend asked if I wanna go see it so I’m debating on if I should or not
Please please on everything I love,  GO see this movie. Don’t go for the plot, there is not one. Went with friends to see it last night and we give it a solid 10/10. Purely because of the fight scenes. Just pure unadulterated hilarity
This movie kicks butt!
When Godzilla and Kong first meet up in the movie I absolutely lost it when Kong was holding up his hands at Godzilla like “bro chill” and then when Godzilla attacks him he immediately hits him with the pocket sand! 💀💀
idk why i am saying this but if u love god like this comment (you don’t have to i just wanted to comment this💀
In my experience It's an average movie at all With some 3d experience Not worth for my expatitions
Is there gonna be a Gamera movie?
Hope they don't run out of locations for fights now Brazil is down🙂 awesome fight Monsterverse indeed
"oh ha oh ha hoooooooooo" translation: "i am iron kong"
2:51
Saw this over the weekend. Did not like it at all. Confusing. Terrible soundtrack.  First two of the series, first two Godzilla movies of the monster verse were pretty good. This last one just didn't do it for me. Give me minus one any and everyday over this most recent.
When they got that little
2:27 imagine being punched by that strength… ohh it’s gonna hurt
big creatures fight, life good
Godzilla vs kong ❌ Kong: in search of hidden kingdom✅
what rubbish movie holliwood is making and we are still enjoy... man get some brain plz and dont make such rubbish movie a hit in box office
This is so dumb...I love it
HOLY MOTHER(BLEEPING) (BLEEP) THATS COOL
Watched it yesterday 10/10 The last fight should of been longer in my opinion but W movie
If you remove the girl and her tribe this would be perfect
🫥
I just hope in this one humanity goes extinct so in the next one there will be no stupid humans stories interrupting the fight
Godzilla went from ssjBlue to ssjRosea❤
I Watched The Movie AND It is EPIC!!
Silly
Americans are useless movie makers use same cheap vfx same stories zero screen presence
It's amazing,
I want moreeeeee. So cool😍
So stupid movie , waste of money , time and effort 😏
What a  trailer iam very shocked 😮😮 nice
am i seing 2 godzillas...a blue one and a pink one?
Now I have seen everything
Hiii❤
King Kong meets planet of the Apes 🤣🤣🤣
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Reminded me of the old Godzilla movies.
It's looking like Godzilla 2. But people like to watch the 1st. Too many graphic people couldn't digest that kind of movie.
batman x superman
I went in asking for giant monster fights, I walked out having consumed giant monster fights. Flawless, 10/10.
The trailer has more humans than monsters
yk its gonna be a good movie when the trailer sends chills down ur back
In the series monarch the people went down the hollow earth timetravelled  but in this movie they dont .. Why?
Who watched the movie ✋
1:26 moist crtical
Kong bout to beat the FastFurious franchise w 20 more movies w Godzilla
Total trash absolute garbage (Save your money) Don't even watch it for free that's paying to much
watched yesterday - movie was good🤩
Oi  The picture of the thumbnail in the actual movie Mothra is hovering in-between them  OOPS🫢🫢🫢
1:53 I was really hoping that would be her roar and ice blast sound when it hits kong
Just saw the movies today , and it was good I can’t complain , the ACTION/CGI was amazing I’ll give it 8.5 out of 10
yeah well, King Kong look like 50 cent
kong got Vemon's ax and godzilla got the nuke burst, these 2 legendary titans are evolving beautifully, I wonder what they will be like 25 years from now?
The good movie ever ❤
I Watched the movie and it made my mom cry :) I Was in the threaters btw! and my brother was with hes friends!
How can I watch this movie in mobile
Love this❤
Soooo can someone explain why Godzillas iconic roar was MIA?! That really bothers me!
This is so stupid it's awesome
Jamás podrán competir con king Kong la del 2005
This looks real bad.  Jesus, just stop making these
Yup... We got no marvel or f&f this year, but instead we had this
Cringest f-ing shid for a trailer I’ve ever watched
Bruh
Another Hollywood trash
Wow 😲😳
scar king looks insane.
These days it seems like these flix are created like fast food. exciting yet shallow.
Watched it. 5/10
Kong is the Ape clan Patriarch now, with Shimo a his mount. Kong even adopted a child. He is dad now. Like always Godzilla is always a loner at the end. I wonder if there might exist other monster like Godzilla out there or is he the first of his kind type? I mean Shimo look is a Godzilla Type Monster, but she is more a Frost Type Godzilla.
Just saw the movie today it was fire!
Best freaking movie ❤️❤️😎😎
Imagine Gamera is in this universe
Supurb visuals, excellent story cool when they team up really good versions of Kong and Godzilla great work 👍💯
Is it out yet?
shheessshhh keeping this OG monsters alive <3
Childhood film Godzilla.......but this is....call WWF war between ....Godzilla& king Kong. ...very very ..... artificial film
This movie looks beyond stupid.
This is most greasy movie...it's a difinate seeing..omg such a great movie..I loved it
I loved it! Definitely buying
I’m gonna take my guess on this movie. Kong and Godzilla fight and one other big monster comes and they team up to kill the bigger threat and then Godzilla dies in the end but wakes up and goes back home. End of story
It was an awesome movie!!
i just watched this am smiling alot the movie was soo great!!!❤❤❤❤
Really enjoyable at theaters!  Specially in Dolby Sound!!!
Kong should be 500 feet tall
I love this movie so much that i have already seen it twice, and i love kong and Godzilla's theme song
I leik the griller
ca a l'air d'etre un beau navet
Im kinda sad to see these movies dip in quality. The first Godzilla and Skull Island, you can tell there was a lot of thought put into those movies. Anything after King of Monsters is just so boring to me.
In the next movie, the toxic avenger will be helping them. 😂 kong won't like that, toxic always pulls the ladies.
This movie lacked depth. CGI and VFX are also deteriorating with every new movie. I remember when Godzilla 1 came out. It was so good and natural. We saw from humans perspective how enormous monsters move slowly because that's how physics work. Now these monsters seem regular size animals just fighting on a miniature city model.  Also the more you show the boring it gets. In earlier movies Godzilla got very little screen time making the audience eager to have a glimpse of the monster. Now they are getting over utilised.
1.             Years ago I was in a car accident and 0:27
Why you end the movie so fast??? Why you made Shimu a PET????Wtf were you thinking? Shimu should be the girlfriend of godzilla, the trash that you made her pet of scar and now pet of kong its unforgettable💔
You know it’s bad when it got Godzilla and king kong stressing
I just saw this movie and it was worth the price of admission. So good!
I just watched the movie Yeah, they've completely embraced the sillyness at this point, they know their audience, this was the most over the top movie yet and I loved every second of it
godzilla was in gorilla tag and needed long arms and got it to cheat☠️
Cool, I've seen the film now😂
Oh yeh, gonna watch it tmrw
I want Godzilla focused movie
The next franchise, which is milked to death.
The problem is the full fight between Godzilla and titanus  tiamat and full fight between Kong and water dragon need to be uploaded please in movie there were small cuts we want more fight scenes ❤👍
They keep getting more human like
but godzilla has looking like shimu
Kaliyah
I watch the movie
Great job.... Very superb
Looks like a PS4 video game.  No thanks.
Wait eaint no eeay they spoilt te 3€ minets of te mofjie😊
Just watched at theatres and oh i loved every bit of it.  More action than the previous one
Man, Rise of the Planet of the Apes has gotten really weird in 2024.
Spoiler⬇️
Imagine you are an Egyptian who worked on the Pyramid for 20-27 years, Just to be destroyed by a lizard with a pink lazer
Best movie best best that running part gives chill in movie 😍😍😍 and I love Mothra 😍😍😍
Best movie 2024
Hammer ich freu mich drauf !
Just now i watched the movie., Very nice👌
🦖🦍🦋🦧🐢❄️
waiting for godzila x kong x planet of the apes
Another CG funny film
Please Warner Brothers Please Increase the Screen time of Godzilla please it is also an Important Titan the movie Was great But u was Really disappointed with the Screen time of Godzilla pls increases the screen time of Godzilla in the next Movie It is a very very very Kind Request from Sravan pls pls pls
best thing is day time scenes...
3 minutes of trash.
Leviatam
Watched this movie,  omg it's awesome. 5/5 ⭐️
I just watched the movie yesterday and honestly it is so short like everything I could process and I can probably name the whole entire movie action from spoilers two trailers it basically shows the whole movie
Well I'm telling you... GODZILLA wasn't scared one bit !!! Good monster movie!!
I watched this last night, along with my wife - who, admittedly, is not a big fan.  I enjoyed the film, but I purposely set my expectations low. There were inconsistencies and coincidences that just took away from the film IMO. But, for what it was - kaijus just going all out, destroying anything and everything in their path - it was an enjoyable and fun experience.  My wife did not enjoy the film. She just felt that it was too confusing and there were too many coincidences that stacked up. In other words, it lacked any semblance of verisimilitude and required too much suspension of disbelief (even for a kaiju film).  One thing I'll say is that the trailer cuts are masterful. It's rare that you see trailers that splice audio and video from different parts of the movie together to create an enticing preview without giving away the whole film.  In summary, if you like massive kaiju battles, this is a good (there are better) film. But, don't go in expecting too much of a consistent storyline.
I predict, this film will be a blockbuster hit, because of its epic large scale spectacle and engaging storytelling. Even the trailer follows the steps of the 3 act structure. I must recommend everyone to watch it in 4D. It will be a wonderful experience.
😂😂
This was by far one of the worst films I’ve ever seen. Dog shite
How many kong and godzilla movies !!?
LET ME TELL YOU LONG IS THE BEST!!!
i never seen kong and godzilla team upp 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
i just watched the movie In the cinema the fights were epic
This movie is AWFUL.  No representation for marginalized groups.  Avoid at all costs
I wont be surprised or dissapointed if we get an Avengers style team up of Kong, Godzilla , Yeagers(pacific rim) and Transformers next.
Nah I stole the first copy I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Godzilla and shimo
godzilla was good until godzilla vs kong
Just watched at cinema. Very good movie. Score 10/10
Zaid and ali’s favorite
Hype nothing else
Peak movie
8/10, go see it !!
We got the Godzilla and Kong team before GTA VI
Kong skull island was better.
The battle is way better than other Godzilla movie !! 😮❤epic !!
This movie looks stupid asf I'm not even going to bother watching it. I'm disappointed, I was a fan of the franchise but it's just getting dumb now.  What is this Godzilla barbie? Why does Kong need a robot hand? I'm interested in the lore not the technology. It seems like most people just want to see monsters fighting, I want a good storyline. This movie is going to ruin the franchise. I was more excited to see Godzilla minute one but apparently there's some stupid agreement that the movies can't compete so now I can't even watch the one I was actually interested in because this bafoonery is coming out? I'm over it. I can't believe there are actually good reviews for this and people are actually excited to see it. Have people really gotten this complacent because Hollywood just sucks now?
Men sad Men watch big monster fight Men happy
I just feel Christopher Nolan should make one of these films.  His realistic touch x the large scale damage in these movies, I just wonder how it will blend.  But Nolan can make work anything ❤
CGI on steroids 😂
It was an entertaining movie, go watch it if you like monster/kaiju movies
Just saw the movie and it was so cool!
Funny movie.  The bad kong know kongfu.  King Kong become iron Kong.  ridiculous
I LOVED THIS SO MUCH I CRIED
Dude this movie looks insane cannot wait to watch it
King Kong is. Wind
King Kong is the. 🐐
Hfuv
Man This Movie Was Life💯,Baby Kong was gettin it in lol..Action all the way thru..Gotta love it man!Been a min since i've seen one this good👍🏾👍🏾
So basically Godzilla and komg vs planet of apes
More of a Kong movie than Godzilla, who appears sporadically and at the end. This one didn't measure up to their last film, which featured far superior special effects, and storyline.
1:54 Thundercats opening scene reference!
I like that old Godzilla ❤
I wonder if there would be another beast coming like really dreadful,kinda enormous or just that big brown big ape is main villain 😅
Just when you think theres nothing left in the tank. They go next level.
No
Saw the movie tonight, and although it had great fight scenes, it wasn't nearly as good because story and acting were better in the first two.
2:06 to 2:09 must be one of the epic scenes in the history of cinema
Just saw the movie! Really good!
Watched this movie in 3d, it's awesome ❤❤
Live watching this movie and have to watch it again ❤😊
Godzilla x Kong 💪💪💪💪💪💪
Possibly the worst movie of the year 😂
Doomfist.
It was the worst godzilla movie I have ever seen in my life. They glorified Kong and left Godzilla to the background. It was a very bad movie. I was going to vomit from seeing the woman playing the lead role. Godzilla is god.
Great movie !!!!
*IMPORTANT FOR GODZILLA FANS*  This movie is a Kong movie featuring Godzilla. For 90% of the movie Godzilla is just a background character. The main story focused on King Kong and the humans. If I knew that going in I woulda liked the movie more.
I went to saw the movie premiere and it was awsome
All of that in one short movie?
I love these Graham Hancock documentary movies about the pyramids. He is the best:)
Phim quá hay. Muốn đi coi lại lần nưa
Kong is Son Goku in Ozaru transformation with Infinity Gauntlet 😂 i think very soon the Super Saiyan 4 transformation is also coming next time it will be Super Saiyan 4 vs Godzilla 😂😂😂
Rawrrr krakatauuuu😂
It’s not out   I’m crying  wennnnnnn I’m the biggest fan of Godzilla and Kong and star king pleas I just can’t wait 😝 i got it  but it only said pre order wen will the real movie come out
Just watched it today and it was epic!!
Release date pls?
These dreams are made in the basement of a single family home with your homies drinking beer and playing video games.
lol   No.
Godzilla x Kong will be the greatest movie😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤
Just watched the movie today that shocked face kong made wasnt because he was scared from shimu that face he made was only becuz he was shocked from seeing the other kongs
wtf is this...feels like another master piece franchise is about to be ruined again
This bouta be lit 🔥
this is dogshit
Loved the movie 🍿🍿🍿🍿
Kong: *step outside of Hollow Earth*  Godzilla: *"You picked the wrong house, fool!"*  Kong: *"Ehi Ehiiiii! Big G it's me Kong, Chill chill!"*
Can’t wait to watch the movie
Awesome!
Is this the follow up of the movie that came out many years ago?
Long live Godzilla, king of the monsters❤
Nah they shouldn’t have. They just pocketing out of y’all money. Dumbest saga yet.
WITHOUT SPOILERS, THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING. THANK YOU ADAM FOR MAKING MY INNER CHILD DELIGHTED WITH JOY.
Just watched it was amazing
WHOS HERE AFTER WATCHING IT🔥🔥
Saw it yesterday with my Dad. We really enjoyed it! Omg it was Amazing! Loved it! ❤️💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Saw the movie today. I love the part where Godzilla said to Kong "It's Godzilla x Kong: The New Empiring time" and Godzilla-x-Kong-The-New-Empired all over those guys.  Truly one of the Monsterverse movies of all time
It was superb 🎉
RIP to all the innocent people who died in those office buildings and homes.
I saw the movie in 3D by myself on March 30th. It took me around fifteen minutes or so to figure out that I needed to have the glasses closer to my eyes for it to work. All in all, I enjoyed the carefree spectacle. I think that the 3D was a good choice. Lots of fun.
My son and I just got back from the theater.  I didn't care for the original movies.  But this one I genuinely like. 😊
flop
this movie was cinema idgaf what anyone says
It sucked. Shallow, long, tedious, no soul. It's a combination of WWF and video game action. I wish Steven Spielberg of some other director of his caliber would make a Kong vs Godzilla movie.
If you watch trailer then you miss the goosebumps movements in theatre for sure... Simply you will get bored so dont watch trailer enjoy blankly in theatres😊😊😊😊😊
Just tried to rewatch the last movie it was boring hope this has better fights and way better in-between human scenes
Getting more and more ridiculous but i kind of like it
❤
Godzilla μόνο
Is movie me hoga kya Kong or Godzilla ki fight koi bata do
Kong not only has the infinity gauntlet but also the leviathan axe
Big monk and nuke lizard go punch-punch make brain do a happy
💡 After 🔥
Not my type but it's about to be looks bad azzery
Not impressed
Wow
Just watched this most boring movie ever 90% story 10% action and action wasn’t even good
10 years after this version of Godzilla was revealed, can y'all believe it.
Watched it last night. Horrible movie.
In the Next movie they will fight aliens....
Literally watched it hours ago, I loved it!
I just watched it in theaters with 15 people, SO GOOD
As a Gojira fan this is a most watch. I loved the first one now we get a sequel?  nice ❤
I love watching movies with nonstop action.  I can watch movies like THIS all day long and never get bored. Enough said.
Monkey with infinity gauntlet, dragon with super sayiaan rose, angry George, and a gigantic glaceon. Perfect
i always knew shimos ice breath was very affective but i didnt know it was so strong 1:53
One of the best movies of 2024. Enough said.
Kong is my favorite
Saw the movie yesterday. I loved it!
3d movie ano
Well I wasted time and money on this 🚮
Today the movie is out
More like Kong vs Kongs
ok nvm trash movie, pea brain may love it i think
Godzilla x kong; the transformers
ape guard humanity, thats just comedy and trash script writing
Çok güzel bir video olmus
Kong and winter ❄️ soldier relate something 😂
We need a Godzilla movie all alone ........😢
We want more🎉🎉
I will take my 15 year old children to see this movie at the Cinemas...!! The Egyptian Pyramid scene is impressive
😘😘😘
Watched it at the theater y’all really cool movie would recommend
Great movie from start to finish
UNPOPULAR OPINION.....THE MOVIE BEFORE THIS WAS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS NEW ONE !!!!
They revealed 50% movie here
Which monster did you love Kong🦧 Or  Godzilla 🐊
I thick when Kong has the infinity gonlet he lost a arm but I dont know
Are there 2 godzillas or who is that in sec 1:55 ?
Are there 2 godzillas or who is that in sec 1:55 ?
KONG: Piltover's Finest
Worst movie in my opinion 😢
Kong should get an Academy award for his performance in this movie. His story and behavior has always been very intriguing, tragic and full of emotions.
Ultra Cheese-fest.   Hard PASS.
Just watched it very epiccc
I watched this movie YAY :D
I got chills watching this trailer
The best movie in 2024 🫰
So Kong is fighting some ginger monkeys ?? OoooOOOoooooo how scary.
Very bad movie i give 2/10
Revolucionário esse filme marcou época
Kong is power full like if u think it is right 👇
Can confirm. Movie was everything I knew it would be.
Why do we need humans talking in this movie ….
Filmi dün izledim böyle saçma sıkıcı bir senaryoyu anca türk senaristlet yazar o kadar boş ki anlatılmaz son 20 dakikasını izleyin yeter gerisi zaman kaybi
This was fun to watch!  Highly recommend it!  Action from beginning to the end
Super Saiyan GODzilla
I saw it today it's amazing
HAPPY TO SEE SCARY STUFF.  WAITING FOR THE ACTION.
Yea man im going to this movie,  who else is going too 😂
Everything is great, except the movie is going into planet of the apes instead of being about Godzilla
My wife: Kung Fu Panda 4 My Inner Man: Godzilla x Kong 😐
Gozill a like small at this time then the building size like gozilla feet
very bad didn’t like it at all
Just watched in 4DX, it was amazing 🤩
Just watched amazing 🤯
Imax pe dekhne walo ke majje hai🥶🥶 mujhe kya phone pe hi dekh lunga🥲👍
Imax pe dekhne walo ke majje hai🥶🥶 mujhe kya phone pe hi dekh lunga🥲👍
Imax pe dekhne walo ke majje hai🥶🥶 mujhe kya phone pe hi dekh lunga🥲👍
is getting ridiculous, godzilla 2014 was so good. Now, all monster moves like a normal lizard and normal gorilla speed....
0:31. Is that Ultraman?
Idk if my mind will ever let me enjoy such things.  Best wishes and happiness for those who are able to.  If it doesn't look real i just can't  do it.
This franchise is not about to jump the shark, it's about to jump the megaladonS ! A whole herd of megalodons!!
Watched it 2 times in theater only for my boi Godzilla ❤️
Just saw the last IMAX showing of premiere night, what a fun start to the weekend. Going to rewatch in IMAX 3D.
Awesome film .... action packed from the start 🛡️
Am I the only one that felt the intensity of this trailer??? Whoa!
Movie wasn't bad,but it also wasn't that good
🔥
Booo. This film is just bad.  I couldn't finish. Bad video game vibe.
Shimo I’d s female I watched the movie and at the end scar king gets frozen by her while King Kong smashed the f out of him
The best movie in years ❤❤❤
I loved it ❤🎉
Wasnt as good as minus one
🔥🔥👌👌 Great moive
Great movie just finished watching it!!!
movies was 10/10 glad i could finally cheer for both of them together
very excited for movie!!!
Just watched it and don't really like it. Typical Hollywood invested millions for CGI and 10 cents for the script. Too many apes like watching Planet of the apes. Humans' scenes were boring.
Cz ❤🚨🚨🚨🚨
Just watched it….. MASTERPIECE
Godzillla
Kong with the bumblebee/stark industries hulk buster power glove
I always loved Godzilla and Kong now that Godzilla evolved into something like shin Godzilla and Kong got the infinity gauntlet without the stones, this is gonna be entertaining as ever
I literally just watch it yesterday at the movie theater it such a good movive❤
This is coolest duo🤩 , i  seen ever.
You're an actual cattle person if you get excited for this kind of slop. Guessing the majority of people who see this in theaters would have zero interest in Godzilla Minus One because they're incapable of reading subtitles.
Movie was a waste of money, way to many time traveling etc, then the main villain had so much suspense built up just to get man handled. Movie in my opinion was boring,confusing, and horribly rushed.
Just came out of theaters and this movie was sooo good!!! Take ur whole fam theyll love it, i dont have kids butbi would if i did ;)
This was amazing tho when they froze skar king and crushed him
Who’s here on march 29   👇
Just saw the movie epic
Full Movie my chenal name @ RONE Gamer
Looks boring
What an exciting movie! I liked it!
Movie will be nice if the director is peter jackson
I like how kong gets to grow 30 more feet to keep the size comparison  And why does lizard man run like a guy???
I really hope I can turn off my brain enough to watch this epic. 🤤
The movie is "OK" but, Godzilla Minus One is VASILY superior.
An O.G. kratos kong,a purple iguana,.a whipsplash cosplaying urangutan and an albino snapping turtle,.what else do we need,.a combination for an epic battle
Godzilla will mop the floor with that crackhead ape
Shimo and Skar were some bad mofo’s in the movie
Man, that 3 minutes trailer basically showed all the good parts of the movie. No more surprise moment anymore!
Why are Godzilla's fins purple? In the film Godzilla vs. Kong, Godzilla's fins aren't purple
Don't waste your money,as usual woke rainbows figured out a way to ruin it
Does anyone know the name of the song that plays when they go to hollow land? I can't find it at all
1:14 When it's November 30th but you can't hold in the nut any longer
we had better monkeys in movies 40 years ago... should have gone with props and costumes..
Worest Godzilla movie I ever seen. I thought I was watching Godzilla movie but nope…it was “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”
hey WB, the fact that u called it Godzilla x Kong instead of Godzilla v Kong means that they must smooch at least once in the film. That's a rule.
T
Just seen the movie I'll see it again
really have to have the alphabet people in every movie ugh
I just watched it yesterday he got eaten by one tree so scary I'm just a kid😳😳
It’s time…
Gw harus nonton si ini
GOATED AHH MOVIE
Worst new Godzilla film ever made. Scaling is horrendous, CGI is bad, the fast movement make the monsters feel small, the soundtrack is incredibly unmemorable and cringe satanists were putting inverted stars all over the beginning school deco scene. Rip the franchise away from Adam Wingard and give it back to Gareth.
T
Just watched it , it was awesome so many epic fight scenes
Just got out of theatre! Loved it!
I really want this movie with my family of Godzilla X Kong The New Empire I hope I will like that movie very much and also King Kong is my favorite character. 🦍🦖😃
Just watched the movie today freakn awesome!
i saw this in class and my jaw was on the GROUND
DISAPPOINTING.  A lot of excessively ridiculous fantasy, a lot stupid and buffon scenes that they take away a lot of seriousness the history, silly and meaningless songs, and the horrible fat black man and his unfunny street black comedy spoil the movie.  just 11 person in the premier, now, I understand why.
2:32 The Atomic Impulse just looks so good i love it
Damn great movie
I gave it a 7 out of 10. Minus 1 blew it away thou. This Was just ok however
godzilla runs dumly
ITS TIME
SPOILER READ THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK                                                             the thumbnail creator use sfx to hide mothra because she appears for some reason
Godzilla saved planet earth many times in ten years it happens three times why not happen the fourth time
ok so i love godzilla with everything right.... but i dunno this jus doesn't grab me
It wasn’t even from the glove 🗿2:27
Where to get full movie
I watch this movie yesterday,  Tbh its fire 🔥
Can the little ape be called Diddy? XD
just watched it today it was a great movie and really hilarious totally worth watching but still cant beat Godzilla: king of the monsters
Goosebumps overloaded 🔥
I just watched it in theaters
I'm sure this will be great for a bunch of children. But i watched Gozilla: Minus One while i was in Japan a few months back and it was arguably the best movie of the year. The fact this movie is blocking that movies streaming option is disgusting and is why I will illegally stream this movie and not spend a dollar in theaters for this. The people deserve Minus One.
I love these movies!
Delightful 🫡
OMFG it's a good thing I didn't see this. They revealed everything... If I saw this before the movie i wouldn't like it as much as I did cuz there will be nothing new.
Urghhh they have really raped the whole concept behind these movies, looks utter shite
Wow what can I say, man? This movie wasn't tense? I mean, this theater was packed. I think there was at least a 100 people in there. I'm not kidding and I've never seen at that pack. Not for a very, very long time. Everybody wanted to see this movie. I loved that. It wasn't a tense movie. I love them with bit of it. What can I say? I am introduced some of the classics that have mathera.  And we got some new monsters or monarchs as they called them or guardians. I mean, it's all different kinds of words. They throw around in this movie, but yeah, it was cool to see mafia again. Godzilla, I actually like the old Godzilla, but I'm getting used to the new look. Baby Kong and of course king Kong himself.  So like I said, this was a great movie. I gave it a 13 out of 13 skull straight. I'll cross the board. I'm saying everyone's got to check this one out. You're a King Kong fan a Godzilla fan. You know, I need to check this one out next. Week needs baby baby gabzilla. Hopefully there's gonna be a sequel. I wanna see more of this.  So like I said , everyone's gotta check this one out
But the CGI is really bad tho
Movie is goooooooooood
Everytime I hear the laser, I hear that tiktok "WOOOOOOOOOOO"
this is getting boring
Great movie 10/10
King Kong gets a transformer arm, cool. When is Optimus Prime gonna come help the fight?
King Kong gets a transformer arm, cool. When is Optimus Prime gonna come help the fight?
Just saw it last night, opening day, first showing and in IMAX 3D.
Bascially a CGI movie. Garbage
❤
i really do hate the fact this movie is only at theaters when i have no damn theaters near me
People seeing this after watching the movie and waiting for the full movie !! ❤  👇👇
I am a biggest fan of the Godzilla series from Bangladesh  🇧🇩.I am so disappointed to see this movie. 😢 What we crazy fans want from this movie that is not found. Moreover 70% of the scene was exposed before the movie lunch.😅 Please next time make a better story plot.❤❤
جطططططططططططططض
These are Waste movies original kingkong and godzilla was the best movies ,nice story and hraphics
i wish theyd drop the whole "apes human team kaiju earth team", it makes no sense.
yes, ill watch all godzilla movies until they change the formula to make it terrible/garbo.
opening shot is kong running for his freaking life lol, some king of the monsters...the zilla would NEVER 😂
Rar
😂😂😂good one
Ft. Curious Geroge 😂😂
Bro today isthe date to release the movie but I cant found it😢
Godzilla is over 👎👎👎👎👎
What time will it come out
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 comedy going on😂😂😂😂
Today's the day, I got $20 on Kong boiz
Godzilla can finally walk properly
Shimo is just a big puppy who doesn’t know anything
Just watched it, why does  the movie feel like Transformers meets Fast & the Furious. Why cant it be like the 1st one a little bit serious & epic....
Tomorrow iam going to theatre experience
tbh the scar king and shimo felt very weak.   Very minor spoilers     Shimo was stated to cause the first ice age yet she achieves nothing close to that feat.
I was expecting that  godzilla and shimo fight would be cool but I am disappointed.
All of the fight scenes was shown in trailers and the fight were very short.   Ghidorah's fight scenes was better than this.
Good movie,very recommended to watching
When is the new empire  Move  is out??
this will be a good moive
In the kingdom of glass everything is transparent, and there is no place to hide a dark heart. If one should desire to know whether a kingdom is well governed, if its morals are good or bad, the quality of its music will furnish the answer.
Give us space Godzilla next
This garbage is the reason why minus one was removed from the cinemas, and is also the reason why there is no blu ray/ streaming release.
Great movie. Saw it yesterday
This movie was actually good. Visually stunning. I saw the movie on the theatres, first day, and I won't spoil but I'll tell something, the first half is mostly based on slow paced storybuilding, and yes, storybuilding, I said it. The second half and climax is full on action. This movie does focus on human characters and it is easily much better than most other monsterverse movies, infact, unique in it's own way.
So what I’m getting from this trailer is, Monke and Big Lizard will be teaming up to fight a BEEG angy Monke and an ice lizard? Entertaining
Interesting they are teaming up so close to WrestleMania....hmmmm
7/10 from me 🫰🏽
#teamgodzilla
Woow❤
I like how they removed the "vs" with the "x". Subtle difference but makes a whole lotta sense.
I hope it doesn't disappoints me like Kung fu Panda 4!
Just returned from IMAX watching this and it was amazing, I loved it.
It's finally here today!
LFG!
They made God zilla and KONG look more dumb looking in this moview in the last one astleast they looked friendly and intelligent .......
Why do i here moistcritical screaming WOOOOOOOOOO
oooff.. this looks bad
Wait there two godzillas?
Thats the most dumb thing i seen in a while
Woke female boss movie with bad CGI........ DEI check boxes  confirmed; with ugly  actors
Who made that big gauntlet?
Idk man, I guess this is too much for Godzilla and Kong lol
Is it good, guys? The version 2021 is pretty crappy.
This is gonna be amazing!!!!  must watch
I cant believe it, all age group of males are in the comment section equally excited “Men together strong”
Dear Warner Bros   I watched the Kong x Godzilla the new empire  movie on the first day first show in our native place India (Tamil Nadu)   About movie  Director: Direction perfect 💯 percentage for entertainment and each and every moment we enjoyed the movie   Cast and crew:  Loveable  and super hat's off...  Music and all 200 percentage    Thankyou for the movie
Like the Fast and Furious franchise, expect it’s still good
The quality of movies has really dropped dramaticly in the last decade or so. This is horrible
G x K before gta 6
BALLS TO THE WALLS
Epic!  Can't wait for the next one
Xem về hay lắm quý vị ơi
Wrost movie of the year 2024 . Wrothless director & writer over conversation very bad
❤
After watching the premiere on march 27th, it felt more like a kong short film with a side of Godzilla. I feel like Godzilla appeared way too little in the entire movie.
I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!! It was So Much Fun!!! And The Action Scenes Were SO AWESOME!!!!!!
Awesome
The title of the movie should've been "Kong: the new empire" that much biased movie 🫴
Lovely movie and sound effect was awesome especially the Godzilla roar
❤
I saw the movie today it was epic and i see what the trailer did with a few things 😄 but best movie ive seen this year
Where can I watch
Watched this last night in 4DX at the cinema,   insane !!
👎👎👎👎👎
Good entertainment 👌
All I can think is how absolutely insane & other worldly it would be to see this masterpiece inside *The Vegas Dome!* 🤩🤯🫨😵‍💫
Here after watching the movie cause I cannot get enough !! An absolute must see in THEATERS !!!!
Nice movie Godzilla x kong kong
I want to face all these titans from Earth well as from realms beyond single handedly
lol after watching the movie about half was the clips that got leaked I was lowkey mad af 🤣🤣🤣🙆🏿‍♂️ still a good movie though.
I'm so glad imma be watching this on my phone on my movie app within the next 2 days
The movie is out                                                                            Soon...

Next monsterverse movie based on godzilla
Awesome
This movie was F******** great fewer people MORE MONSTERS loved every sec of it.
Espero outro muito top

Please put this in the movie i want to
Aadjeevitham kayinjat oru kai nooka tta🌝
Poraa
Any sign of destroyah existing yet?
Saw it today and it was not as good as GvK in my opinion. Felt a bit rushed and could have been 20-30 mins longer to fill in the gaps. 7/10
Can't wait to watch this for tomorrow!
today is the day
Yes!!
اليوم راح ينزل اتوقع
OMG THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!!!!
Download ko mamaya yehhh☺
Kapan tayang
Mamaya na pala ❤❤
expectation sky-high Bro
blue is beetter than pink
Just watched it, the movie was great, I probably wouldn’t mind watching it again but I thought the ending could be better, the armies of monkeys didn’t come to the surface to fight off humans or other creatures. It was just kong and Godzilla vs shimu and scar king which is why I definitely wouldn’t give it a 5 star or maybe even a 4 star. But the movie was still good enough for what it was supposed to be, barely though. My idea would have been a little better.
The effect looks like cartoon or 2D, I wish it could be better.
Its too worse 🤮🤮🤢
Just seen it today. It was freaking awesome!
Movie Title is Godzilla X Kong yet the focus is on Kong the whole time. Have a feeling Pinkzilla is only gonna be in this for like 30 mins.
I can't wait for godzilla vs shimo to fight
Round 2 of clash of the titans
Looks like non-stop CGI with a mindless  video game vibe.   At least 2014 Godzilla had a human element to it.
Hollywood getting more and more ridiculous. We want a movie either just Kong or Godzilla only. No VS bullsh!t.
The new Godzilla x Kong movie was the most ridiculous mindless movie ever. No plot, no meaning, no message, just stupid monsters killing each other and just like the old Japan days. This makes this movie absolutely the BEST MONSTER MOVIE EVER!! YOU NEED TO SEE IT!!! It is sooo good!!!

Seen the movie today!! 😤  I’ve been waiting for this movie for months. I’ve watched every trailer read every comment and I’m pissed   I’m extremely disappointed with this movie. I’ve loved every movie so far. They took the time to let the movie develop but this had no patience and felt like they tried to jam three hours into two hours.
I mean, I like dumb as much as the next guy, but this looks like a whole new level of retarded.
Just finished watching this movie in an early access showing my theater was having let me just saw ITS A MONSTER BRAWL. Quick paced movie leading up to an amazing sequence of fighting. Can’t wait to go see it again!
Man they beat the scar off that big monkey at the end it turned into a handicap match
Another level 😊
After watching this movie, I express my want for a prequel movie… like thousands of years ago showing a war of titans.
idk why but i want to see godzilla go up against a group of fully grown skull crawlers im curious to see how that plays out
i love your god work in godzilla movies
The movie was so epic 10/10✅
Bro finally unlocked the atomic pulse off his skill tree 😭🙏
I can wait to bootleg this!
This is the best movie so far
Out of all the things in the world a lizard vs a flippin monke
Okay it was pretty tight
dont waste your money on this garbage
Kong and Godzilla vs. The Kardashians next
Hopefully Godzilla steps on Kong's neck.
I'm so happy that there bringing back mothra 😆
Forget logic! Just enjoy the ride!! LONG LIVE GODZILLA!
Tomorrow❤❤❤
We will have this before GTA 6
jesus will still stand forever
NOW THATS HOW YOU MAKE A GODZILLA MOVIE
My famil my god master
Wait is this a comedy? Trailer had me 🤣
Fake
Wicked good 😮 🐉🦍
ok, so we might see in 2027 Kong with an GIGANTIC AK47 and GODZIlla with BOOSTERS in his feet or something ? This is not Kong and Godzilla anymore...
Imma about to watch it. Wish me luck.
So cool wow 😮
Rio de Janeiro 🇧🇷🔥
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
i am 55, been a Godzilla fan since i was 5. never thought that i'd get to see such incredible big budget depictions of my childhood dreams. this stuff is magic. pure gold for those who still have a sense of wonder.
Everything wrong with movies
Só não pode faltar as referência  dos  iluminatis e o olho que tudo ver kk clichê dos filmes oferecidos
Can’t wait to see this movie just one more day until it releases
I’m getting a Hulk vibe with this… LOVE IT
Movie flop. Scar king is actually weak. No fun watching. Godzilla didn't get a single hurt. What kind of film is this.
bro this trailer is really good
Why are there even people in this movie, Big monkey,Big lizard team up.   I hope the people drama doesn't pull the fun out of this. It looks fun
Ez egyre rosszabb 😢
Why is Godzilla pink?
looks so bad
Iron Kong 🤣
Dragon Ball reference
I just realized it's been exactly 3 years since it was Godzilla versus King Kong
Looks great but all these new age movies have black stars that act way over stereotype. It’s nauseating
Kong got them brass knuckles on!!
You best believe I’m watching this movie opening day
Legendarno
this gonna be epic one damn
Need another film with just Kong.
YASS ITS CANE OUT TDY
Bjir rawr krakatau🗿
This is english unlike minus 1?
How many of you are waiting to watch this Film
Bass abb godzilla ko "imma barbie girl" song pe nachado 🙂
ITS COMING OUT TOMORROW
From Kong vs Godzilla part 1 I saw that the film makers always make mistakes with the size of these monsters. I saw these movie clips and realised that the film maker always changes the size of every monster in every scene. So many mistakes. They know that the film is going to hit so they just ignore the perfection and make silly mistakes with every movie.  I think This monsterverse needs a better director for the future.
I see epic monster battle, i click like.   Simple.
Fast X extended steroid version
bro ive lost the plot, what universe is this again>?
Super saiyan rose Godzilla vs Super Saiyan Blue Shimu? Not to mention ssj4 Kong vs full power ssj4 scar king? Nah this movie is peak for all dragonball fans 🔥🔥🔥🔥           (this comment is a joke)
mothra died in 2019 mothra 2024 is back godzilla will meet mothra again
9/10!!!!
Kerenn reekkk
Bro has a furious powerfist
It's Lizard meets Monkey time again 😅
3
Godzilla unlocked super saiyan Rose🤣😭
This will be EPIC!
Just saw this. It was not perfect but was very entertaining. The audience clapped at the end. Will watch it again.
❤❤
Wrong matching! How could King Kong able to fight Godzilla? Kong is much smaller that he needed to climb to the top of Empire State Building, and Godzilla is as tall as a commercial building.
Nonsense movie
The movie is coming out tomorrow!!OMG I CANT WAIT!!!hope I'm old enough to see it in the cinema
Something I’ve noticed is that the action is too fast and it might be weird to say that but have you noticed how giants look like the move slower becuse they are bigger and if the Titan fight sceences are in slow motion than👌
Is there a new godzilla 2029?
I just watched it!!! It's very cool, and ofc exiting!! I wanna watch again 😞❓
No,  even from the trailer this looks like trash, too much CGI, too much humanising wild animals, too much woke gen Z junk
These type of movies only comes from Hollywood  why our film industry  didn't  think about high level graphics  movies
I cant wait to the movie to be out
Who watches this nonsense ? *Low IQ* dimwits that's who . What's all the red & blue light ? Is that supposed to be magic light ? Hollywood knows most people are  stupid . They can be made to consume anything .
Finnally tomorrow is the day
Rodan come home 🌬️🔥🔥🔥🪽🔥🔥🔥
kong x shanks
I can’t wait
Overkill in my opinion! We need new types of movies coming out ,
Kong, planet of the apes, ghost busters we be getting treats this month
Mini Kong *MVP* ⭐️
Don is like
Like your monster verse movies, all of them, Kong  Godzilla
0:31 this scene is Suko has destroyed crystal making Shimo out of control
I hope the human side of story doesn't feel forced like the previous one.
Scar hit the left hand of kong but the armor put on right hand Of kong???
OMG PERFECT 😍😍😍
Warner Bros
This looks amazing
The way Scar king pulled that bone thing off kong and scratched his arm, I thought that was scary
Lolololol
BALLE JATTTAAAAA
i watching already yesterday.really enjoy it!
Can't wait 🤯🔥🔥🔥
2021: "one will fall" 2024: "rise togheter or fall alone"!!!!!!!
Good 😊
Godzilla is the G.O.A.T no 🧢
Saw the premiere in Stockholm today. Damn Scar King got wrecked!
1:51 Kongs wtf face
If humanity was under attacked. LORD OF HOSTS  WILL SEND HIS INSECTS, FIRST
Saw it today
Bruh who are they even fighting...
I already watched it lol.  No spoilers 😡
Who thinks scar hips so red😁😁😁
They really destroyed a few landmarks don’t blame them though
Is the shimo
Now Kong has the infinity gauntlet
Iam so hyped
I'd MUCH rather see Godzilla Minus One, but this CG overload is holding back it's release.
Every epic scene is roaming over youtube is there anything left to watch now😅😅😅 please  now release it over youtube so my money could be saved all epic scens and monsters are revealed😡😡😡
If they rise together work together they can defeat evil ape 🦧
Why too much VFX and unimaginable things
i am 36, will be watching with my 6 & 5 years girls
ALREADY WATCH THIS AND IT’S SO WORTH IT!!! 8/10!
stupid director
you guys understand how lazy this movie is lmao?? Kong climbed the empire state building, same building Godzilla was stopping on with one step. now they the same size? gtfoo
2 Godzillas guys watch the trailer over again
I'm in my 40s and can't wait for FRIDAY
Blue atomic breath is cool,But pink atomic breath is SUPER COOL!!🎉
Louco para estreia. ❤
In the end, after beating the giant orangutan, Kong will get the title king. Hence, King Kong was born.
Bgmi update coming soon ❤❤❤ 🕺 🕺 🕺 🕺 🕺
So silly its good!
🔥🔥🔥
habis dari bioskop nonton ini, emang bagus sihh
SKIT COOL
Always 😂
Skar King body language 😮‍💨🔥
2:05 Blackpink In Your area ❌ PINKZILLA In Your Area ✅
King scar vs Kong and Godzilla is so unfair but i see its going to be a 2 vs 2 since shimu is there
Finished watched the movie in my country. All I can say is those who loves monsters fight, well this movie is for u guys 🔥
King of the monsters earth war's

Is it just me or do i hear charlie shouting wooooo every now and then
Awsome
垃圾戏
It took 20 yrs to go from me smacking action figures against eachother to seeing it on the big screen. Nice
Destined to be a flop
Kong got infinity guantlet Thanos be like - where is my guantlet 😂😅
Really! King Kong needs assistance now?
Rio 🇧🇷
No matter how silly,  hopefully it's good for entertainment ❤
wait where’s baby Godzilla
Looks like a second godzilla, the kongs worship, and the orangutan great ape is a henchman of sorts. So godzilla vs. godzilla and king Kong vs. king orangutan.
Another boring CGI movie
I didn't know Curious George had his own movie😂
Hopefully all about Godzilla and Kong and nothing much about the humans in particular that Asian girl with supposedly special power
Zbi x qlawi  the empire of tboun

I've lost way too many brain cells watching this trailer
PLEASE HELP ME GIVE ONE MORE DAY FOR MY CHILD Hello dear users, please listen to my story if you have time. I am an ordinary middle-aged man from a so-called developing country. All my life I have lived by my principles, they seemed to me to be the only true ones. I loved my wife, protected my family, defended my country, did not lie, did not ask for help. I was not rich, but I did not consider myself poor (I was wrong). My family had a roof over their heads, everyone was clothed, clothed, clothed and fed. We were happy. My spouse gave me a daughter and God knows I was even happier. In March 2021, a pandemic took my soulmate and my daughter and I were left alone. But I kept my hands up, worked and raised my daughter, compensated for my mom's absence as best I could. In November 2021, my daughter was diagnosed with SMA (spinal muscular atrophy). We were allocated a place in a public clinic, a local charity offered to help us organize a collection to purchase the drug Zolgensma. And when more than 30% of the necessary amount was collected, I was contacted by the foundation and told that they stopped cooperating with us, calling me a fraud. I could not understand what was going on. The foundation never answered me for what reason they did this to us. Later it turned out that the Ministry of Health reported on the utilization of funds, at the same time, among others, indicating that my daughter received the necessary treatment. I cannot say exactly at what level the funds were stolen. But state databases show that my daughter's needs were fully met. When I started looking for the truth, my daughter was kicked out of the state clinic, and law enforcement came to me and made it clear that there would be more problems. Today the situation is as follows, I found a private rehabilitation center, in which actually my daughter is. It costs $60 a day to keep her in this facility, while I make $7 a shift and $12 if I stay overtime. I sold our house, car and all of our possessions. I sold my left eye through a middleman, now I'm negotiating to sell my kidney, I swear to God if it would cure my angel, I would sell all of myself. I don't know what to do next, I keep working, sleeping on the couch in my daughter's room. I realize we are just one of many who need help, but I would do anything to give my angel another day of life. Below will be attached crypto wallet data, in case you have the opportunity to help us, in any case please help to see this post to other people https://x.com/Adam_Hope3188/status/1772653685224489014?s=20 . Sorry for not disclosing my details, if the authorities of my country find out what I am doing, I am afraid we will not be left alone. With hope, loving father.  0x2d15037E4bAE1303e53d76c417B1c4A5fF77F2E9
Gonna be epic to watch in 4dx
Dear WB team  I'm writing these comments my query to you, why this movie is not releasing in most of the big theatres in India,  Tamilnadu, especially in Coimbatore . Because only 3 theatres are  releasing this movie
Not watching this

This is one of the worst things I’ve seen, congratulations.
Sir, Can I use This trailer video link on my Movie News Website? I will use Your Channel Link. So You get the credit. Please Let me know. Thanks
This trailer looks clearer than Godzilla King of Monsters
Definitely can’t wait to see this in I max
Im ready to see Gamera in thrown into the mix 😂
Ooooooo I love it
Reginald McDonald said God bless and keep up the great work out there coming from Jackson Ms and we love y'all out here too ❤️🙏🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼
Would be amazing if they collab with marvel
👋🏻, 🐱 Kong.
1:45 shouldn’t Kong have put the Beast glove on that hand?  Edit: no it’s not Cause Shimo froze his right hand
28 de março aqui no Brasil 🇧🇷
Good lord, what is happening in there!?
LMMFAOOOOOOOO these movie writers and directors are killing me 😆😆🤣🤣
I can’t wait because this movie is coming after my birthday
OMG SHIMU
That box at 2:27 💀💀💀
They never fail us ..
Kong❌king kong✅
I though Kong lost his arm at first like how tf.
2:33 PLEASE TELL ME IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO RECOGNIZES THIS SCREAM
The entry of Godzilla is energetic but harm for kond is bumblebee hand😂
My guessing is, shimo will kill skar not godzilla or kong, its gonna be a twist at the end.. shimo will break control from skar and will kill skar at the end. And at final battle mothra will come with a massive comeback to save Kong and godzilla i think
Mind blowing and masterpiece ❤❤
Bad news, guys. The film was already struggling with pre-sales - which is why we’ve had so many promo spots - but its even worse than expected. There is literally no excitement for this film amongst the general public. It’s going to tank hard.   Don’t believe me - see for yourself. I’ve checked 12 cinemas for all showings across the opening weekend and it’s tumbleweeds with <10 seats sold.   Having analysed box office results for several years, I’m sorry to say that this is clear indication of a flop. At this point, an opening weekend of $25-30m is not out of the realms of possibility, and that would be a death sentence, considering it was already feared for a very disappointing opening weekend of $45-$50m. 😕
It's all getting a bit marvel
Bre
Muito bom gostei
4 days 😮‍💨
Me witing for march 29 while im waiting in march 25
Kong babu ki jai ✊️😂
They doing Tag Match now?
The movie is out now in moviebox
So they beefing again? Or is that diff Godzilla?
How come the other kongs just look straight up gorillas?
Vagahah
Remember the good old days of 2 misfit cops working together for a common goal. Damn, look how we've come....
KONG NEED A SUIT OF ARMOR AND ANOTHA GLOVE AND HELMET AND GET TO IT!!!!!! 👊💪💯💯💯💯💯
Re,jbfsfreliuhfraelihisbfreh FeawzoiewhOifewa
Milly bobby brown?
Now make “Dragonlord x Donkey Kong.”
Where is cate and kentaro?
Am excited
Khatarnak😮
Could this franchise get more stupid. These are the kind of stories one writes when they are a child.
This is the first I've heard about this movie and it comes out in 5 days. What terrible advertising
Kong vs skar king reminds me of caesar vs koba in planet of the apes
1:38
Who is the villain?
열리 잼 없겠네
The way those two run together 😅😂, i love it 2:04 esp after that bean charging theme    Also guy i feel like the frost godzilla maybe the one which froze Ghidorah in ice.
Hollywood needs to take a page from the Japanese when it comes to making  Godzilla movies. It's not all about special effects and corny character humor. Minus one was a great movie
🎉
Dumb haters:ThIs mOviE StUpiD AnD ChiLdiSh MinUs dId It BeTter      Showa and millennium era:
Cgi looks too much like a videogame. It used to be so much  better. Same for Transformers, look at the first ones and then look at the latest movies…
Looks good, but WTH is it with Godzilla’s baby head?
Is that paperboy
This movie is the reason why the minus one  blu ray is not released, legendary/ Warner bros  have a contract preventing minus one's release.
but we need mothra and we need her now🦋
These movies never disappoint.
I got tickets. Can't wait!!
wating for this acction
I love the part when Kong said “It’s Kongin time”
This film looks trash
HE WON BE ALONE LONG LIVE THE MONSTERVERSE LET'S GO THERE
GODZILLA AND KONG FEET TOO
HERE WE GO
Movie Of The Year?
SOMETHING IS COMING
Love it😍
Would be better if they added more godzilla monsters like Gigan, or king ceasar. But eh it looks alright.
I love Godzilla vs kong
4D IMAX fun???
Those are definitely the largest carnivores.
Well, this is gonna slap
Oh come on, I thought they were going to put Destoroyah in the movie.
So much new Godzilla movies and you guys forgot about Lieutenant Brody! Godzilla saved him back in Godzilla 2014. I can’t believe he’s gone😢
Hmm so now again world is in danger and united States of America saved us 😂
Will it be on Netflix
Bro which year release
Can't wait to see shimo, literally has a chance of being bigger than monster zero
Man ooo man
This movie is pure trash!
Kong got electricity back bois
This looks so stupid
Look out, Multiverse
👇people who want Kong to get the dubs on this one.
Godzilla runs like human…😮
I don't understand this movie..I can't find any sence.
Showw sem palavras pra esse conteúdo de hoje e bençãos infinitas bençãos
THIS.LOOKS.SO.DUMB.
At least mothra will be in the movie❤
Shimo revealed😍😍
Watching big creatures fight, Men happy
2:27, that punch was really personal
If Kongs have been using tools this long, why are they still apes? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What will they do next, make a bunch of Godzillas? One Godzilla  One Kong  One Iron Man One Hulk Godzilla minus one was the best movie in this genre ever made. For 1/100th the price too. Will this movie also have human characters who people might actually care about? I bet no.
amazing movies and series as always!!
Theatres gonna blast 🔥. Narration superb 👌. Visual fantastic 🎉. Bgm are pure goosebumps ❤.
Child can be watched?
😂😂
My 5 year old child can't wait to see this movie. It's good they make over the top movies for his age group that he can believe in, as his Brain hasn't quite developed yet.
That's awesome 💯
Godzilla and kong giving me Wwe's Cody rhodes and seth Rollins tag team vibe
Amazing 👍✌️
2:12
Bros gonna live up to the name king Kong
😂😂😂😂 this is a jokes
I prefer Godzilla minus one
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is Call Of War!!
Another children's story with impersonal monkeys without organs. Have fun kids....
still want to know why Godzilla is Pink
Move 😢 😊
👻 You should try this out
CAN’T WAIIT😆🤯😯
Insane Trailer,  Goosebumps on my Balls
Can't wait to see it. I am watching now the first one.
Awesome can’t wait 👍
So are they saying it’s an under world under the pyramid 🤔!
I bet no one’s gonna like this movie when it comes out
I’m watching this in V.I.P so I can feel like I’m in the movie 🎥
Where is Ralphie?
"I call this form.. super saiyan rosé! Is it not beautiful"!
Nah, am good.!! They need to stop making Trash movies like this.!!!
Seeing Godzilla and Kong run doesn’t resemble big scary monster vibes to me
Pause at 2:13 and do it fast to see shimo
Garbage
2:04 This scene man. 😆
I love yuo
Is it me or Zilla been on the treadmill at the bottom of the sea?
I don't care about story  anymore. I just wanna watch a big monkey and a bigger lizard fight another monkey and even bigger lizard
Very excellent which
Fggbgg. Cdfg. Hey/6bvgvvcr mtg hkjji  I’m 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮him
Tokusatsu at its best..
3🗻 4,600 yo ÷ 1 enormous 🤖 or 🦍or 🦎= ?
Godzilla with Kong will be legendary movie
2:06 SPOILER ALERT: K&G 🤜🤛 fist bump.
Shimo would be..... 250 Meters!!!
This has to be the dumbest movie franchise going
Blade ball ads be like 😂😂😂
😂waiting to see it. Kong going rogue w/Zilla.
I came here because Ultraman😢
W 🔥😎
Looks just as stupid and ridiculous as the last one.... AND I LOVE IT❤❤❤❤
Looks like planet if the apes 5
Bro these movies should be very dark like it was in godzilla 2014 and godzilla king of monsters this movie style is very light and not giving chills god zilla 2019 would give so much chill
2:34 It's mothra?
Why does all this CGI look like a video game? Very cheap looking film.  Let Japan handle Godzilla cause America cannot make a decent film.
I'm team Godzilla all the way! I do like Kong too but I prefer and love Godzilla more!
Can you imagine: 1. Where do they get such a big monkey to star this movie? 2. Is it worth it to demolish the great pyramids for a movie?
Why do I keep hearing Penguinz0’s “WOO”
Yeah! Kong got the infinity gauntlet.
When pacific rim 3?
Godzilla 🔱🔥
Hopefully it's not awful as Godzilla VS Kong 3D. That movie sucked so bad, and it was so unwatchable because it's too dark. It was like trying to read a book with very little light.
Godzilla, king kong and the rise of the planet of apes....!!
I wish my mind were simple enough to get into this new Kong/Godzilla stuff. But looks like to me they've basically cartoonized the characters. And they're making Kong and Godzilla act and behave to 'human' like, with human emotional traits...nah. And they make Kong and Godzilla give a dam what happens to humanity, again, nah... Again, way to over scripted. I prefer the old Kong and Godzilla, that were both weary of mankind, in this movie, they seem enthralled to humans, like the transformers or something...nah... I can tell this movie would annoy the heck out of me, so not going to watch it.
I though Minus 1 was connected the the island series on Apple but it’s not
Bhaichara on Top 🔝
Yessssss
Kong is going take Godzilla down
Cant wait to watch when it out.
Monster vs people
Blue Godzilla vs purple Godzilla mini Kong vs king Kong
What happened at Godzilla his purple or blue
Is that a mini Kong hahahaha 😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂 o mi cough it so funny it a baby Kong hahahaha 😂😂 but Godzilla was the best movie ever again
Is that the same Godzilla
Waaaaa
Ngl this looks like brainless garbage. The bad kind. I'm all up for big monsters punching it out but the dumbass sci-fi elements and godawful modern writing always must manifest and ruin the fun. This is becoming the next Transformers and I'm already appalled. On top of that, it's losing scale comically, like Pacific Rim 2, soon enough we will have no sense of it and it won't matter.
End looked like Godzilla and king Kong were laughing together.
Does anyone know where its gonna come out?
hola
Front and center wben this comes out. Love em both
I love how they're just going crazy with this one. We're going to see more of hollow earth, Kong has an entire civilization, and Godzilla's having a Shonen power up story arc (hopefully with as little dialogue as possible). I'm a bit worried about the final battle scene, though. It looks like it might be a bit too much like the one in Godzilla vs. Kong. Sure, there might be two kaiju they face this time, but I don't know. All I know is if this movie ends with Godzilla and Kong being transported to the Pacific Rim universe by way of interdimensional shenanigans, I'm gonna throw a party.
They just showed the whole movie
bro that is accull sick damn dude
✨
Can the other Kailua show up to?
e
0:48 is anyone noticed that is a Earth Godzilla??
Wow so this looks terrible
Patiently waiting on Gamera.
Who is exited for the movie?? The Godzilla movie series are my favourite ❤❤❤
Not Kong with the fallout power fist 💀
It is a great emotion for me, who is Brazilian, to see the final battle in Rio de Janeiro
Godzilla new power? 2:30
💥💥💥
1:08 my favourite part
Producer: Neon, neon everywhere.  Director: yes
wow trailer is awesome
What is this? Kong vs Sun WuKong?
We’re family. We protect each other, that’s what we do! D̶o̶m̶i̶n̶i̶c̶ T̶o̶r̶e̶t̶t̶o̶ ❌ Godzilla & Kong ✅
I just feel like its somewht like fast and the furious  hobbs and shaw
Cox maraqli filmdir. 3 dəfə baxmışam. Okeanın dərinliyindən gələn suda quruda yaşayan canlilardir. Hami yaşamaq isteyir

Finally something good in this year 🙂
Like boring
I feel like I've seen a movie where there is a journey to the center of the earth and there is a hidden world where the sky is also land and they go to a temple there for some reason. Anyone knows the title?
Bəyəndim cox gözəel töhfsiyə edirem 😊😊
No matter how big Godzilla is, it can't beat the height of any building in the world, even the Burj Khalifah😂🙏🤝  NB: since Godzilla was born.
King Kong ke sare movie bekar hai 2005 ke alava 2005 he is the best movie 🍿🎥 fight and treasure and action adventure
Dangerius of the serius 😮
Çok güzel bir film izlemenizi tavsiye ederim
I liked all the parts of movie. It is very good.
Quite fantastic new movie of that very classic adventurous KingKong. Love it! ⭐⭐⭐
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Godzilla 💯💯💯
This movie definitely won't fail and if it does then you can make fun of this comment
I can’t wait to see this movie
This movie is going to be so dumb but I’m going to love it just like the movie sharknado… 😊
😂😂😂😂wtf did i just watch..
I love villains, I can't wait to see Skar King!!
2005 king kong is all time best VFX or graphics
Zilla an Kong ..together again!!
Oh great another film surrounded by a deaf person that knows sign language
Bella cagata.
Actually looking like possibility of entertainment. The good kind.
Baddest movie of the year
Ok but hear me out, there's gotta be atleast 1 lady Kong that isn't tryna kill him😏
I'm sorry but if the big baddie is just a giant orangutan, I'm out
By watching this trailer, I realised something: the Kong/Godzilla movies are the new Transformers. They are meant to fill that gap left by those silly, bloated, nonsensical but also highly enjoyable movies by Michael Bay that Paramount just stopped making. At first, the Kong/Godzilla movies were meant to be serious - just look at all the personal drama in 2014's Godzilla, at how gritty and dark Skull Island was. But with time, producers realised that putting drama in movies about giant beings fighting each other is just silly. So put an awesome gauntlet on King Kong and let him at it.
This March, 2:09 🌅RISE TOGETHER or FALL ALONE! 😈 2:16
😮nfbff,f a31qlaa.  Cc mfmekwkaamaam d w❤😊😅😮
i an so hyped for this movie its gonna be insane

Where is Kong's Genital?
Being born on  0:13 and knowing about 0:31 in every trailer. Godzilla is usually a little bit ahead.
Offff fragman efsaanneeee izlemek için sabırsızlanıyorum 😍
Wonderfully movie 🍿🍿🍿
İlk filim gibi ikincisi de harika olmuş
"Something even they're afraid of" Godzilla's afraid of no one.
remember guys kong is still young and has to lot to learn and godzilla has a lot of experienceso maybe in the furture kong would be stronger than godzilla

So are the titans like the Colossus? Or WEOPONs?
The trailer is a godzilla
The fight together ,rises together to conquer it .
This looks stupid af loll only my opinion
I say, go get them boys!
Anyone watching this in 3d?
This looks so stupid is our world such a video game that they have to make the movie so over the top?
Uav Kaiju planet of apes everything in one film
I am quite excited! This looks so good. Please do not disappoint
Can we get an academy award category for trailers? They are officially better than the movies they advertise.
Man i thought godzilla would unlock the 20 times kaioken not super sayain rose
❤🎉
One of the best vfx n cgi movie
Chains of shimo...... Who chained shimo
2:33 that power bro🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WHHAAAT....They aint even show the enemy!
Another noisefest
What the **** did I just watch?  I'm a fan of Godzilla and King Kong... But this looks like a bad video game trying to rip them off.  This makes me sad.
9 MORE DAYS BOYS AND GIRLS!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 After seeing them running, I think kong and godzilla will do kungfu move in the next movie. So inherently human-like (esp. you, gojira!!)
I am so excited
This is definitely going to be the dumbest movie ever made
Godzilla is my first movie after my birth and here I’m waiting for this extravaganza! So excited 🎊 💥
This is dragon ball
Godzilla Op!!!⚡
🐐🐐🐐
Let’s get ready to RUMBLE!!! 😅❤😊
"We need Godzilla and Kong, the world needs them.”
Notoriety. End. Metal in the century
Gashhh, Jia us so annoying
What would be cool is the Kong King vs Mecha Godzilla
MarvelZilla 🤦🏽‍♂️🤮. No to colorful and pink back. SHAME!!!
They should king when he was a Bby showin journey through world find his way through
I think there is something wrong with my YouTube. I’m getting comments about King Kong and Godzilla on my DBZ video 😂
leakers: we'll tell u the entire movie  warner bros and legendary: r u sure abt that
Guy: Kong can't stop it on his own  My brain without a moment's hesitation: Godzilla could stop it on his own!!!!
Im sorry but this looks generic af. This movie will fade in the background like all the other heavy cgi action films
this looks so bad. kids will like it though
Just watch The Man in The Suit for reference
Didn’t they learn from Unknowingly NOT TO PUT GOJIRA AND KING KONG TOGETHER?!
😯👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻😯👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻😯👋🏻☝️
Such a stupid idea for a movie never watch this type of bs
Stop it
Sometimes we just need a simple BIG MONKE FITE BIG LIZARD movie to distract from the world
❤
Something is coming big
It’s awesome seeing Godzilla and Kong together again
They put the metal gauntlet on Kong's jacking-off hand. Im just saying they could have been a bit more considerate.
So I’m hyped about this or whatever 🙄 but I pray they don’t make me regret goin to see it
Does anyone know when it will be released?
Takes some real balls to release this diarrhea after Godzilla Minus One.
Nice 🎉
I can NOT WAIT!!!!
So what is Kong & Godzilla  fighting  ?
ITS THE END FOR DISNEY😂
Ngl i wish Monster 0 could some how pop out of no where and say “dude you forgot about me like..“
❤
❤
❤
❤
❤
❤
❤
❤
❤
Man There is no DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRAILER 1 AND TRAILER 2,AM I Cheated ?
Next Godzilla x Transformers x Planet of the Apes x Kong
I wasn't really feeling GvK part one before I saw it, but I was blown away by how much I loved it, so it's right to say I'm absolutely, completely and utterly beyond hyped for this🥳🥳🥳🥳
1:40  am i the only one who noticed suko among the group
Cute
Why has the bgm/ost for godzilla vs kong become so worse? I mean, ost was SUPERB for the initial 2 godzilla movies - Godzilla and then king of the monsters. Alexander desplat gave a scintillating score for the first film. So did Bear McCleary for king of the monsters. Adam wingard is a genius in uplifting the action moments and all. But, what's the matter with him sidelining the score? Worried 😢.
Definitely gonna watch this.
Japan and usa work together hmmm interesting
Gosh Hollywood makes some trash now doesn’t it…
Get ready for the most pathetic movie of your life after jurasic park
I have so many questions, mainly did they replace Alexander Skarsgard with Dan Stevens and thought we wouldn't notice? 😂
Who is the villain?
what an absolute pile of cgi shite
Nasa netflix na bayan☺️??
Godzilla? Afraid? Nah.
0:30 two godzila☠️
King of the Monster #Godzilla ❤
I really like that they're friends now and can get along
Nope
God I can't wait lol❤
See what happens when studios take their time and don’t rush things. We get epic movies, unlike Star Wars, Marvel, DC, etc
Praise the God, Hail to the king and down with the new empire!!
Best movie of the of 2024,I watch my boy the GMan🐊 even when I'm dead 🤴🏾❤💯🙏🏽 the Hype is on 9k Let's Go..💪🏽
Live long monster verse
"Hey! Who likes Stupid Movies..?! Fantastic! In the next one, the Writers have Kong 'talking' and Godzilla has a baby!" "Alright!" say the Horde of Morons.
I Think i will like pretty woman more to much for me
this movie has got major pacific rim 2 vibes
this is going to be massive
where is ultra man?
Y’all cool with this? After Godzilla 2014 the series had so much damn potential for some good serious toned Godzilla movies..the kid stuff is cool but damn..I wish they’d go back
You know I see how sturdy and strong some of these buildings are in this movie and I can’t help to think why the World Trade Center buildings fell simply by airplanes 🤔
So in Godzilla vs. Kong, Kong had to go help Godzilla. Well, looks like Godzilla is gonna return the favour
I’m so glad Godzilla minus one came out. The legendary Godzilla is just going away from what Godzilla movies are.
Oh goodness!!! I cannot wait to see this!!!
There literally showing mostly the movie
Dam kong is getting old. Got a brace on his arm now
Man please, I’m not wasting my $$$
On march 29
I’m going to watch it
I’m going to watch it
godzilla minus one, it is better!
1:46 - 2:00 is it just me theorizing, or is that another kaiju aside from the scar king that's attacking Kong? I don't recall mammal kaiju having glowing eyes, being able to withstand lava or blasting power beams at their opponents
No marvels only WB fire ❤
Godzilla sprinting like Sonic the Hedgehog now. This has gotten ridiculous.
so goofy
2 lizards amd 2 apes like wth
Looks like fantazy of 5 years old kid who playing with his toys
Nope in no way can I watch this at the theaters without losing my mind. Going to wait until I can stream it lol.
So there's a red Godzilla and a blue Godzilla? Or am I just trippin? Which ones good and which ones bad?
If Godzilla and Kong exist, would politics be as bad as today?
Godzilla >>>>Kong
çok kaliteli ve kesinlikle izlenmesi gereken bir video
2:29 Kobalt
The CGI is getting more and more....... CGI looking...
Sad. 😢
She looks ugly with the short hair. Looks like a boy...
Kong got 1000 of gorillas
Hwee comes warner bros..  They have actually belief in me now... ROFL🤣🤣 dont we... ROFL godzilla eh... ROFL bow does it feel.. Whe  god fks you back... ROFL🤣🤣  Now let me ask gou lottle boi.. ROFL batman.. ROFL do you bleed.. ROFL🤣🤣 oh dont bleed me river please... ROFL🤣🤣
when two MFs be together like Godzilla and kong so no one can defeat them💀☠🗿🗿
PS
I really hope the soundtrack to the movie will be Godzilla by Eminem and Juice WRLD at the end of the movie🔥🔥🔥😭
You better to explore more of the kaiju, getting bored with these apes
Me a grown man gonna be acting like a little kid when this comes out can’t wait….giggling already not even out yet…😂😂😂😂
Please come soon godzilla new empire ❤❤❤❤❤
I'm excited ❤❤
This looks good, but Godzilla Minus One is a masterpiece!!
Macera dolu
mind blowing 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How 🤔 Dumb  ,  😅overkill 😂😅  no 👎
Intelligence vs education. CV what is Real ? Science tells us how big creatures on planets is related to size and gravity. Even on earth going back to prehistoric age certain sizes were bigger but still related to earth and gravity. KJinm - some places size could be massive. Ae Garbage planets.
godzilla fears no kaiju. he is the lord king of all kaiju. dont even compare kingkong to him.
So stupid but I’d watch it
Looks worse than Madame Webb.
It's getting ridiculous now.
Crazy theory what if Skar king can learned to speak. Not in sentences like small phrases like Kill, Blood, No, Yes, Feed, Chase or Hunt. Not in English maybe but the people living down there. So maybe English
It's so ridiculous it's actually good.
1:13 YEAH BABY THATS WHAT WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR
It's going to be a big nothing.
So they made Kong take after Optimus Prime from Transformers Beast Wars 🤔. Sounds like a plan l guess.
Okay hear me out. I thoroughly enjoyed Godzilla 2014, Godzilla vs Kong, and King of the Monsters. I absolutely LOVED Minus One. Kong: Skull Island didn’t really do much for me. This premise for this movie cringes me to no end. So I personally won’t me watching this film, but no disrespect to those that will. My question though, is why is this film being received with so much anticipation? The story seems so sub-tier, predictable, and generic. Or are people mainly excited bc of the eye candy of watching the titans on screen again? Cause I really don’t get it
After decades the US gov. still thinks they can shoot down Godzilla 😂
After seeing the film "godzilla minus one", this looks like a junk food for brain and nothing more. Cool and shiny but weightless cgi with empty cardboard human characters and cringy writing.
Stuck between this looks stupid and cool
Im sure the monster action will be amazing. But i can already tell im gonna hate the human characters.  They seem incredibly bland and unfunny, just like the last movie.
Oh yeah great. Lets first give kong a new axe and now lets give him giant gauntlet.  He needs all the help. 😏 Next time we're gonna see  mecha kong.
Why is it a pg-13? They just don't make movies for adults anymore.
GODZILLA 2014  KONG SKULL ISLAND 2017  GODZILLA KING OF THE MONSTERS 2019  GODZILLA VS KONG 2021  GODZILLA X KONG THE NEW EMPIRE 2024

OMG...Only in Theatres
Love Kong and God Zilla but please no more humans 😂
I'm going to see the movie this weekend
Love from india ❤️
this is so cool😊😊
And still, no Amazing Colossal Man...... At least Rick Baker played him.
Skar King 🔥
This CGI looks so fake
My first time watching this was the 2014 one ehh!  It's great
Why do they keep changing cast if these are supposed to be sequels?
Why does Godzilla have such a tiny head? It doesnt look right
Man  why did you destroy our pyramids?😂
There's no need to make this movie.  You got Godzilla running like a person
Skar king looks like the Beast Titan from attack on Titan
Feels like they just showed us the entire movie.
damn...
Producer: “any idea for the next instalment?…anyone?” Writers “let’s create a threat for Kong borrowing ideas from Planet of the Apes..let’s also give him some gadgets to make him stronger..plus Godzilla can decide to help him” Producer “excellent idea..let’s also remember to stick in that girl who’s deaf..who has a unique relationship with Kong”

No Millie Whitney Houston’s ex husband isn’t in this one. Why? Millie…tossing her hair back full British accent: “Because they SIMPLY can’t afford me.. they simply simply cannot afford me…. Plus, I’m marrying a nepo baby so I’m set for life.”

Madonna che pattume
Like Monster brothers......
this CGI looks like PS5 cut scenes. so fake and lifeless
Trailer- “For centuries there was harmony”  Me- “Then the fire nation attacked”
As much as all these kaiju are well welcomed & respected nothing compares to a creature with the word God in his name.

Powerful People Makes Places Powerful..
Gives me goosebumps!
Cody rhodes and seth rollins of the monster verse...
I love both of these TITANS  ❤ Glad to see them together to save the world...Again!
FFS are you guys even trying anymore with the CGI???? It looks like utter garbage in this. Are you just letting A.I. run wild with it?
Looks stupid.
I haven't been to the movies in a long time but this im coming out my cave to see😂
I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THIIISSS WHEN THIS COMES OUT ON TV
What’s coming? Deceptacons? That would be cool
been a fan of godzilla since my childhood. and this is my 27 th birthday gift wich is on march 29th im so happy this is the best birthday gift ever.
Every now and then,I come across a film that I must see and this one is one of them💯💯💯💯💯
What? No Optimus Prime? Deal Breaker
Omgggg can't wait Godzilla and kond together i can't waitt anymore i love this movie already 😳😭😭😭❤️
Can't wait❤❤❤❤
I'm calling this now! Mark my words and remember this post. They're trying to fool us with this ad. I do not think Kong and Godzilla are running together. I think Kong is chasing Godzilla and jumps on his back trying to stop him from running away. I think Godzilla is under some spell and that's why he and Scar King are both pink. I think Kong is fighting Godzilla to free him from the spell and he will go back to blue again. I guaranDAMNtee that's what's really happening.

Story sucks, let’s just enjoy the CGI battles 😅
A quote that fits Godzilla: “big thighs but no guys”.
I can't wait to see skar king 😊
Hollywood making Godzilla pink ? Why ?
They're taking this too seriously.
Funny how nowadays blockbusters look like ultra-low budget b-movies.
Lets gooo Godzilla
It's great but I hope one day the somber tone of Godzilla 2014 comes back where one other thing they did absolutely great was how the angles were taken to make Godzilla look absolutely colossal but here they just seem like normal sized with small houses or something. They don't feel huge and gigantic and all that. Not much aura. I don't know how to describe it.
This looks so stupid.  And enjoyable.
Shut up and take my money !
I thought the enemy aline was Scar King, but what ever that thing in the dark, with the glowing blue eyes was, is an entirely different enemy.
Now I have seen the whole movie..
Oh my undies
Ok, y’all done came up… 👏🏽
Movie of the year easily
THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We are witnessing the RISE OF KING KONG… make NO mistake, there will be 2 kings….
Godzilla when ultra ego
Scooch over supers we got a new justice league/ avengers team and it don't look to bad
How are the monkeys a threat  I gotta watch this
Top de mais adorei
WB why this movie have lower run-time????
i got goosebums
King Kong will say that Kong vs gordzilla war in memorial.
How many times you wanna destroy the human property?   Godzilla and Kong : Yes

Will baby Godzilla eat each other if very hungry?
What is that when Godzilla eats will definitely vomit?
Will Godzilla eat man drenched by sewage or foul smelling things on him or her?
PINK GODZILLA
What happens if it's eye or brain damage restrict or kill i?
What would happen to Godzilla's feet because of the long steel rod coming out of the foundation of yet newly built buildings. Will it not restrict the movement
Can an underground metro train be ideal for mass evacuation? As it difficult to   cause damage deep down the earth.
Where does Godzilla love to sleep? It can be hunted there with intercontinental conventional missiles ?
i miss the 2014 godzilla
Godzilla for the simple minded.  FU  Hollywood. Glad Japan knows how to do Godzilla right.
So... who's the enemy?
How y’all gone show us everything in the trailer
Hi
simpanze
As a Godzilla fan, this looks dumb AF.
Warner bros cash grabbing an old movie plot instead of coming up with something new?  What are they marvel?
UNLEASH ALL MONSTERS
😱😱😱😱Can it release like..tomorrow 😍😍😍😍😍😍has some marvel to it
Godzilla afraid of something? Na, it's just another challenge for him
Hey Warner Bros pictures 😁👋
If jet jaguar doesn't make appearance imma be pissed
Free fire only like
This looks so bad actually! 😅
The DEI character is the only thing that will ruin this movie.
I can't wait yo
He unlock ss blue god😂
King Kong has the infinity gauntlet ang godzilla dragon ball rose
So somebody gonna do the Nintendo remix?? Donkey Kong x Bowser??? Ill wait 👁👁🥤🍿
Kong going down into the portal at 1:10 will be awesome! 😆
Yo Warner bros props to y’all bruh I haven’t seen a movie better then this yet and this is just the trailer
If there was an award for most hype trailer, the Kong, Godzilla monster verse would win every time 😤😤
Is that Doomfist from Overwatch? Hear me out...
Wait it was real oh I didn't know my bad
This is fake
Hot damn, I can't wait to get this from the $5 bargain bin at my local Walmart! The Bigger Jaws bit from Family Guy still applies to this.
Well that looks horrifically bad
Godzilla is luminous pink and kong has a metal fist…so cheesey
why is godzilla pink bro
Watch0:30
Really something is coming 😢
Kong’s looking a little old I hope they don’t kill him off and make little kong his successor.
The best tag team in the history of the WWE
1:02
WOW, I can’t Wait!
So is the next kong movie gonna be he and a human fuse to fight together lol
As they say it’s going to be a battle Kong fought godzilla and lost but he grew and they teaming finna go down
Man the sfx of the trailer are on top notch
Is that your real credit card??!!
i cant wait for this dumbass movie
This is why  Legendary godzilla>>>midsei midzilla
@GODZILLA_V OBUNA BUB QUYIYLAR ZUR VIDEO GODZILLA JANGLARI TASHLANADI
I don't get it, so are there like 4 Titans (skar king, kong, Godzilla, pink Godzilla) now? Or just 3?
I can't wait
I think that godzilla is a legendary kaiju that he was first bad and 10 years past now is powerful and good and fast
Kong and godzilla vs scar king and shumo who will win
Godzilla is now the most powerful kaiju in the universe but if can defeat shumo but the new godzilla x kong the new empire with scar king but kong is helping they might have a better chance
If they give some kind of bs revenge win for kong when they fight in Egypt I’ll be a little annoyed. Just want to see them team up, they were chill in the end of the last one
i so excited
hi
Let our king fight its rival.   Our empire it going to stand still.
2:00
Godzilla VS. the death star well according to mega damage VS. SDC in the Rift universe the death star would win. Godzilla is a Mega damage creature in an SDC world. SDC is structural damage per second, MD is 1000 SDC per second to do 1 mega damage. So, if you don't at least 1000 SDC per second to a mega creature they will just heal so quickly it is negatable damage. To do mega damage in an SDC world would just about destroy your world in so doing. So, the death star is doing enough damage to kill a world it would probably kill Godzilla.1 mega damage =1000 SDC in a second =1 mega damage. 1 mega damage is like a paper cut to a mega damage creature. Look up the game Rifts or Playdium really cool stuff and a good alternate to D&D  .
i... i am kong! *snap*
Konk, Junior
It will release on my birthday 🎉😊
After seeing the derpy way Godzilla walked in Minus One, the way he’s running at 2:07 is just funny to me.  But I hope this movie will be good. Minus One was amazing. I want the Monsterverse to live up to that level, too.
🥵🥵🥶
Hola
.
Lol the interaction between the humans & titan in these movies are so forced but I do love seeing the titans fight eachother.
All about people again I see
When did Kong grow to Godzilla size anyway. Kong had to scale the skyscraper, Godzilla is as big as a skyscraper. The lore is all messed up here. Also, Kong looking like Thanos is just.........ME SHAKING MY HEAD.....NO
They don't have to like each other, they just have to work together 💥🤜🏻🤛🏻💥
The destruction in the last movie was so disappointing I'm finding it difficult to get excited for this.  Every time something was blown up or smashed it literally turned to dust instead of massive chunks of debris. It felt so empty and fake I may as well have been watching a kid play in a sandbox. 😂
1:02  i bet he had to beat off a lot of american guys to get that job
Here me out…..  Final fight of the movie, kong has beaten scar king and now Godzilla +kong are fighting a losing battle against shimo. Then out of nowhere a massive hoard of other kongs come and proceed to absolutely body the heck out of shimo and drag it back to hollow earth to make them ice pops for the foreseeable future, credits roll to the music of “what I’ve done” (transformers ending song to the uncultured people)
Do you all think this is appropriate for a 5 year old boy? 😭 besides the CGI violence?
Looks bad 💀💀💀 Coming guys seriously this is just getting Pacific Rim2ed
Godzilla's new form is amazing and Shimo looks great. This is going to be epic.❤❤
Oh my gosh is that that one animator
Kong and Godzilla two good guy❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
DAMN I DIDN’T KNOW KONG WAS LIKE THAT 2:27
The disrespect godzilla is shown time after time always playing 2nd banana (pun intended) to Kong. I mean Godzilla is the franchise but you wo7ldnt know it from this

Seriously  I can’t wait
This looks absolutely terrible how are the comments positive on this one
Lame!!!
After Godzilla Minus One, this one looks like a letdown. Unless the reviews are glowing, I'll save it for streaming.
How come Godzilla is a good Guy
Shimo bota go crazy if not many parts of him are in there
So the flyer is megarus or how ever you spell it buzz saw chest bot
I miss how the old Godzilla moved 😢
If Scar king size and power should be overpowered then we feel more thrill against Godzilla, Kong Love from India❤🎉🎉
Bro Kong got that Hulk Buster arm repair upgrade and Godzilla got Vegeta's Ultra Ego, this time is bout to go down
I love Godzilla !
Apes fighting like human beings , walking on 2 legs which they do not do , godzilla with long ape arms and they're both running lkke humans ,, i dont want to see this as a godzilla move , they should call it apes and lizards
Everything godzilla should not be . Long armed and human like . Stupid
Gonna be #mindblowing 😊😊😊😊
Meanwhile humans : We need kong, the world needs him!
1:58 That axe better not go the way of mjolnir.

They're just embracing the cheese at this point.
Can’t wait to see it
Is it just me or does this franchise look like its turning into something like the Transformers one ?
hi warner bros i am a big fan of godzilla and kong but i live in a village and there is no cinema here it is too far so i can't watch the movie so i have to watch it from any site for free i am sorry
hi warner bros i am a big fan of godzilla and kong but i live in a village and there is no cinema here it is too far so i can't watch the movie so i have to watch it from any site for free i am sorry
I read the entire plot. Scar King is stronger than we think. He grapples with Godzilla, and takes him down. And Shimo is actually on the good side.
Where is our Godzilla
15 more days or 14 and is out
Is it just me, or does godzilla look really skinny this time?
Shimo is here finally
Skar King has them Marked, He Controls Shimo...He "Holds the whip" lol wow no GoT fans
Avengers assemble
Maybe some future future movie they will team up and fight aliens from Outer space that would be epic!
I cant wait to see shimo vs godzilla and Kong vs skar king who would win let me know is it godzilla and kong or skar king or shimo
I wish Mothra was coming back in this one 😢
And to think the book of enoch decribes the giants height of 400ft & i believe thats the height of kong in the movies
This is like...Power Rangers level acting.
saya sangat ingin menonton 3D
This looks kinda cringey
Why in trailer 3 you have to show us Ryan why is Kong and Godzilla one in the world in top speeds like like right they just saw something that was very small
In the very first trailer of God's calling the new Empire there was a ton of Bones so the squawking must be very old shouldn't he be dead by now if he was that old in the monster verse
Kong and Godzilla kind of like brother and sister where they don't have to like each other but they just have to walk together kind of like that stuff
Make the trailer 3 for Godzilla X Kong and show us she must face please please
I have a feeling that shimo will break free out of scar king’s control in the movie
Looks like the dumbest kaiju movie ever. How can they think about releasing this trash after Godzilla -1? Shameful.

'Kin shite! Franchise started off as sober and remotely plausible. This trailor indicates the flick will have all the credibility of the Hanna Barbera appropriation of Godzilla.
People Who exited too see the mothra again after years I wonder what She Will look like😭
Dam I'm so hyped for this
1:13 speed 0.25x 😂
what kind of fanfic  is this
Was that another godzilla in the dark
DIS MOVIe GOIN BE LIT
THIS BETTER BE IN 3D!!!!!!!!!!!!
The ULTIMATE Buddy cop movie lol😂😂😂😂😂😂😮😮
Looks like the best film for 2024 already
I’m A huge fan of Godzilla and Kong
Overdone and cringy
kong(usa) and godzilla(japan) against shimo(china) and a red gorilla(russia)
These actors don’t seem excited to be on set
2:27 there shimu right there right next to scar
This looks stupid
Team godzilla ❤
1:52 shimu remind of Rudy ice age 3 and ice age 4
Part of why Monsterverse films are up in my top favorites is because all you Legendary and Togo does is give incredible CGI and action , which is what you gotta do to get your viewers invested. Even if it’s not a good movie in terms of good movie standards, Godzilla X Kong: TNE  is going to be amazingly entertaining and loved by the entire community. That’s sheer impressiveness.
FIFTEEN DAYS! 😀
At 0:54, Godzilla sounds like he’s in pain. Maybe he’s holding so much power that it’s impossible for him to control it in his normal blue state, so he has to reform his dorsal plates in a block of ice to hold all of the new power.
I already hate this movie cause it's delaying Godzilla Minus One release for online streaming. I hope it tanks.
ini seru dan pasti penasaran kalo belum nonton nih.
looks really stupid
A pink Godzilla lmmfao nothing is safe from the agenda 😂😂
Great ..another avengers movie
maybe after this film there will be a new film that is similar
Good I like movie 😊
Дичь
Im sorry, but i think this movie is going to be terrible
This wasn't rampage 2?  Dang😔
It's Going to blasttttt😂❤❤
これは絶対に面白いと確信しているよ
When did it release in theatre
Will it be that when Kong kills "Scar KING" he will finally be called "King Kong"? 🤔
This new Tekken dlc trailer looks great so far.
We need to see Missing titans: Typhon, Bunyip, Yamata no Orochi, Baphomet, Sekhmet, Mokele Mbembe, Quecalcoatl on screen
Kong and Godzilla vs Kong and  Godzilla😮
Can someone pinpoint when the monsterverse became the new transormers?
Ahh I assumed it was another Godzilla Vs Kong, But it stills Kong and godzilla vs the evil monkey empire.
Omg isn that mothra in the girls eye as the girls eye was on the screen in her
Godzilla and Kong is basically the 2 bullies at school, they both HAD a giant rivalry then this bigger bully enrolled in, so they decide to work together to kick out this bigger threat. But they still hate each other.
wow
This is so stupid.
Godzilla and kong  will be epic
🗑️🚮🚮🚮🗑️
Wow
I can't wait for this movie❤❤❤
Really loved it.
aThey both look badass everytime another movie comes out!!!
Well I wait for Rodan's return
Can’t wait 😀😀😀😀!!!!!
Godzilla also need some eye lashes and blush on and kong needs an iron man suit. that`s stark heresy.
Ooh look a buddy cop film
NO ONE KNOWS HOW EXCITED I AM OMG I LOVEEEEE THESE MOVIES AND I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS‼️‼️🥱🥱🥱😱😍😍😍
I New Challenger has approached Godzilla and Kong our battle will be legendary
W trailer
29 March?! I also want to watch movie.
They still pitching that bs script with the lil mute girl in it total trash and will be forgotten 😂 I don’t remember the last time I felt like rewatching these movies besides the one with Nicole Kidman in it they do nothing but nonsense script wack
You can tell how good a movie is going to be by the background, if it changes rapidly throughout the trailor you know there's a lot going on, and it's gonna be awesome
2024
Battle of the rising nephilim
This looks like a big mess of cgi and lame story. Hollywood insists on overexploiting franchises and destroying them in the process.
This movie is gonna be very good. I’m a fan of Godzilla.
Punk godzilla
Well dam I guess I gotta go watch the first one😮‍💨
this looks like pure fodder
Who else can’t wait? I’m about to preorder today.
1:41 is how I felt when I got the ending of the film spoiled-       and I actually mean it. And by ending of the film I mean the ending of the 9 minute fight at the end.
How it feels to see your f a k e best friend 0:50.
Soo at 0:31 you can see what i think is mothra behind godzilla if you look really really really close. Or it could be city damage.
15 ⌚️
Shimo???? They're dead LMAOOOO
Can’t wait. Love when they team up and fight a common enemy . That being said mothra has always been my favorite. I lost it in the theatre when mothra climbed on godzillas back and saved him   Love these films
This makes no sense to me
So who the fk are they fighting??
Shimo is coming
I requested to all the Hollywood creators that please stop it , I know that this is all  fantastic but can you please make a movie on social dilema
In Hollywood always you show about future..  I want to tell you why you always show that things which is not in your hand and even anyone who are born in this wonderful earth..
You people create this very feared things and in your trailer you talk about humanity how this is possible if you showing the destroying events in this.. just how would you please explain
King Kong Got The Infinity Gaunlet This Is Going to Be Epic
Came back after watching the final trailer. Scar has all the earmarks of being the lazy "Why should I fight when my minions can find for me" type of villain. I'm calling it now, as I have been for months. Scar is going to call Shimo before the fight with Kong goes too far south for him, because King Kong is 100% winning in a one-on-one. He's going to overpower Scar, but before the other kongs see Scar for the weakling he is, he's going to call out Shimo, whose only under his control as an animal that's been beaten into submission. Once Godzilla and Kong together beat the tar out of Scar, she won't recognize him as a threat and she'll either turn on him, or just abandon him.
when  c omes  the  new movie out
From bloodthirsty rivals to blood brothers! Well done WB!!!
LES GOOOO
Movie sold be 2h 66m  did like this movie are thay many another one
Does anyone else miss the ps2 game War of Monsters?
Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be epic.
This is the lamest thing I've ever seen.  I'm not impressed by CGI anymore, and no matter how much "epic choir #12" they throw on it - it's all just *_lame._*  From the ultra-cornball "teaming up" thing, to the continued, convenient fudging of their relative sizes,... it's just a movie to please little kids.
Godzilla minus one looks better than this
IM BUSTING EVERYWHERE
So this is where the series goes off the rails. Ok.
Can't wait 🤩🤩
I cant wait for this
Will do 10 pushups for each subscriber I get  just type done below ❤❤
It will be a epic movie
Love God and Lord  by The gazillion  Grabill  word  lordy wordy I empire  love truly  tested  mankind  and civilization  and  humanity =humans  all intell intelligence  intellectual  property  rights  of law of God
lgbt pinkzilla😂😂😂😂
This feel less like a Godzilla movie and more like action movie scaled up.
I’m so exited for the movie
Wwhere is Dominic Toretto😂..He's missing
The way mini kong threw a rock at Kong at the end
that was awsome
army
2:04 me n my boy on our way to f*** s*** up
Oh look Donkey Kong and King K. Rool
As a long time Godzilla fan this franchise is looking more and more mid all the time. No sense of size of scale anymore with the fights seemingly been speed up to keep audience attention as well as not shrouding the monsters in darkness, smoke/dust, or water has made the cgi look a bit worse even ten years after Godzilla 2014 as well as each films plot getting progressively worse. Really 2014 and Skull Island were passable at best for plot but still pulled out an enjoyable movie. But the two films that followed were nothing more than a monster mash. Which is fine 90% of Godzilla's filmography is just silly fun... but then again Godzilla Minus One showed us we could have out cake and eat it too. American producers just think you're too dumb. Plus What's scarier/more powerful? A Galaxy invading three headed dragon from space that can regrow heads? or.... rEd MoNke
I was reading on one of the news on the computer, and due to what I read, it's going to be one final movie. My reaction to this article is "Well, this stinks. And I have a perfect monster to act like a final boss at that." I may be a Godzilla fan, at least I'm not one of these people who have read the same thing and overreact.
I wonder if those who discovered Kong are still alive or dead (I'm talking about Skull Island)
Dumbest shite ever….  Cmon??    Have you seen a Kong?  Godzilla?  What world are we living in…. I loved all these movies but getting a bit outrageous.    But for all that will see it….  Enjoy!
Big monkey fight big lizard? And vice versa?
There’s actually no way they turned kong into doomfist 😭
The REAL A-Team!
1:55
pink looks sick
What are they fighting? Wtf. Just dumb characteristic dumb script.
Kong gonna use gorilla tactics. I think scar king going to use orangutan tactics
I theorize the reason Godzilla has blue and pink in this trailer is he absorbed the blue AND pink energy in hollow earth and that’s backed up by the fact the shade of blue matches the hollow earth shade and that it’s ligher than the og darker blue
Godzilla’s special skill: destroying bridges.        🌁🦖
Kong is Thanos now
Two godzillas?
I can't wait 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊i love Godzilla and king kong
So we got goku black and Thanos in this new movie and lanky Kong and didyy Kong and ice Godzilla
Isn't about the same script as last years movie ?
I’ve never liked these movies bar maybe one VS one.  But this looks AMAZING 😮
Why did it show kong and godzilla fighting arent they supposed to work together?
FIRST OF ALL. WHEN HAS GODZILLA BEEN AFRAID OF ANYTHING? KONG AS WELL. WHO IS SHE TALKING TO?
How do these keep getting better and worse at the same time??
How big is shimo
Kong needs his weapons smh
🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯🤞
Banger
XD
If skar king lost to kong he wont EVER defete godzilla
Kong and Godzilla bustin' cheeks again can't wait
At this point I hope they will do a crossover with fast and furious 😅
Is this based on a true story?
So... Another "Godzilla" will be the major enemy in this. *Hollywood has no new ideas.*
Kong just need to klik his tumb and finger like Thanos did
Годзилла и Конг: Новая империя
2:27  NAHH
In theaters goosebumps❤❤❤
at first we saw blue godzilla, i wonder did he turned pink after motha appeared or smth

Godzilla is the best fhitger😂😂😂😂
Everything after the first film just gets dumber and dumber. This franchise really could have had potential.
Godzilla is bland why believe or not he is bland and he should be not a t Rex but now Godzilla is now powerful enough to defeat shumo this is got to be epic

I wish mothra will come back again. They need a healer and a buffer.🤣
Can’t wait for this
Why are people complaining about  SK, and Shimo being GZ, Kong Dupes. Duh, everyone knows good the final villain is an evil or alternate 'version' of the MC.. it's honestly a very old theme.
The BEST Sci-Fi Titans, from the 2 most innovative countries on Earth (Japan & The U.S.A.)! EPIC, with no parallel! The LEGENDS live on!!!!  Cannot wait to take my Grandchildren to see this in the theater!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤
This Gen-Xer Super-Fan that's seen EVERY SINGLE Godzilla (& Gamera) flick, is very impressed with the adaption of obscure sci-fi details from the original movies that appear to seamlessly blend with tastefully implemented creative liberties, to form something new and awesome, that will breathe new life into these solid titanous sci-fi legends and assure that they live on in the hearts & minds of generations to come! I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE IT!!!
I CAN'T WAIT ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
so mother just doesn't exist
In the next one Kong and zilla are on the same soccer team.
After Godzilla Minus One, this movie looks like cartoonish garbage.
Gives me chills in my spine

For real? talk about trying to get water from a rock. These godzira kong movies are so played out. they got nothing else in hollywood?
That's amazing 😢😢
so looks like the antagonists are  1. another godzilla 2. another giant ape
They have showed so much in the trailer!!
Tell me why it’s turning into the 90s video game Rage. Apes vs Dinosaurs
So excited for this movie
Aw man 😔 bummer
Ka me… KA ME…. KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 2:33
mat saleh kalau buat cerita memang taknak kalah.. ingat dah settle dah dalam movie lepas..
Looks like next flopping movie
Bros pink now godzilla can be the full on rainbow
I Want to watch it so bad
At what point does we start classifying these as animated movies?
A reason to go to the movies 🍿 🎥 again 👏👏👏
I know lets copy a bla movie and give King Kong a Nintindo power glove and we can turn Godzila red everyone loves red !  These movies where way better back when they had guys in rubber suits
Warner Bros never should have never shown a 2nd trailer the 1st trailer was all they needed
I just found out about this thanks to the godly ability that is hindsight, but I discovered a cool detail about Godzilla and Shimo!   You all know how Skar King and Shimo are supposed to be the "evil versions" of Kong and Godzilla, right. With multiple parallels to them (like Godzilla having blackish scales and reddish dorsal spines, and Shimo having white scales and blue spines). There's another parallel I just found out!  Godzilla is aquatic and makes his home in the ocean more often that not (water), while we first see Shimo when they're behind a wall of lava (fire) that contrasts with their breath abilities (Fire for Godzilla, Ice for Shimo)
Godzilla movie 2024
Godzilla
The Endgame
Kong 😮
Scarking is never a problem but shimo really is 😮
Godzilla 🦎 + Kong 🦍= 🤝 Working Togethers Rise 😃
Can't wait till it's out
Next Movie :  - Kong dead, betrayed and killed by human (just like his previous franchise in which he died at the hand of human) - Godzilla grows bitter towards ungrateful human and trigger the events in Animated Godzilla Trilogy movies ( Planet of the monsters, The Planet Eater and City on the Edge of Battle), where he wrecked havoc on the earth. - A flashback of Atlantis destruction, Godzilla destroyed Atlantis for their betrayal, a reason for why he hate human from the start. And the dead of Kong only strengthen his belief that human will never change.  If I write the story, maybe I will try to inject this plot😂
Very cool ans all thqt  ut nothing beats godzila drop kick
Godzilla done went super Saiyan rose 😂😂😂
Monster movement are so fast that why they are not look like monster 😂 like toy
🤫🧏‍♂️
1:13  big sound is 🅒🅞🅞🅛
I hope this wins the Oscars for all categories
Minor augmentation, Kong get a mechanic arm. Major augmentation, KONG's body will be fully covered in Metal.
W in da shyatsss
amazing
that's shimo
Cringe intensifies
❤

This is going to be best movie of 2024
Monkey with a mechanical arm im gonna watch this
🤮👎
I mean hey just spoiled  the whole movie 😢
本当に楽しみだ。ゴジラよ盛大に暴れろ
Get rid of all the actors and use their salary to help pay for the CGI needed to just make the entire movie without the people.  Nobody cares about the people.  Fans want to see the monsters, not a B plot about whatever small problems the humans have.  Oh, unless they're just running around as buildings fall on them or whatever, then that's fine.
honestly i had that whip idea for a story of mine too bad they owned it ];p
Why pink? I know barbie is a trend now, but why?
Is eleven not going to be in this movie?
Let’s go Kong’s about too snap half of humanity away and Godzilla went instant kill mode
yawn.....
I don't want this to become Pacific Rim 2, where the huge objects and creatures don't have any weight.
New Villain Shimo looks sick
Why have they kept the previous actors.. I meaning Millie & Brian.. Both of them are so trash
Scar king gets no love. I wanna see him wreck shop ,but of course kong and zilla are my dudes . I just love a complex villain
Dear Warner Bros, take my money and let me watch it already
bro just snap
Why does this movie look good, even though it’s prolly gonna be 39% on Rotten Tomatoes?
Most annoying thing about the  godzilla films is the constant size changes sometimes he is 100 ft tall then he is just a bit bigger then kong then the next scene he is back to being a 10 x bigger then back again great films but stick to one size make your mind up already it looks silly
Kong is a gorilla and Godzilla is a lizard
Do people actually like this kind of stuff? Is the target demographic middle school boys?
please tell me this is a fever dream. i dont want it to be real please.
When will Godzilla and kong be in Fortnite
Excited for the Final Trailer and of course for the full movie
Transformer Kong & Godzilla Then💁‍♀️
Idk dude.
I can’t wait to watch it
IRON-MONKEY
Please don't release spoilers...
Godzilla king of monsters
Why is Godzilla pink
Kong's like, "I love the power glove. It's so bad."
NOT STOP
Is this showing?
YAY ITS BEEN SO LONG
Aint no way Godzilla became goku black lol
I think Godzilla is at this point is done with humanity. Which given how many times they’ve tried to kill him, can’t say I blame him
OFFICIAL STATS FOR THE MAIN TITANS IN THE FILM  Suko: 149 feet / 46 metres  Skar King: 318 feet / 97 metres King Kong: 337 feet / 103 metres Godzilla: 393 feet / 120 metres Shimo: 530+ feet / 160+ metres
0:30  Mothra✨
this movie could break cinema records i swear🎉
less than 3 weeks 😊😊
so good vidie gye wll done
Havent been dis excited since spider man no way home foooookkkk march 29 lesssssss goooooo
30 se
That little kong was SO cute to me. LOL.
King Kong vs king loui
I feel like brazil gets frozen over many times.
Vfx is looking like an animation....
Nothing will stands infront of nuclear Godzilla
Kong has Luke's robot hand now
Godzillas selfish and Kong will sacrifice himself to save everything. Then that will give rise to suko.
This looks terrible.
March 29 2024 10 mach 2024
Lebanon PA system
Now Kong has Thanos' glove
AlanKeithFink on Threads. This place has everything: midgets, murder, Kong..
Wow.
Hey, maybe you should write this off on your taxes too
I dont think thats the real scar king when he fights kong his color is different and he looks shorter way way shorter u can see when king throws him hes shorter i think scar king has a son or just a different lookalike scar king??
I’m excited!!!
I’m good…
I'm a little confused if anyone can help me out here. What does Kong and Godzilla fight against when they fight together. Who do they fight is it a bigger King Kong that's more stronger than the regular Kong? Or is it a different species of animal that is more stronger and that's the reason why Kong and Godzilla need to fight together to defeat the bigger species of some kind of animal?....✍️✝️🇺🇲
LOL
1:50 my face watching the trailer.
I ws team Kong for the first one. He would have lost if it wasn't for Mecha taking Godzillas attention. If it wasn't for the humans, jump starting him Kong would have died anyway. Kong in this one is going to be a badass, I bet. Bigger, older, more experience.  I can't wait
Nah after seeing scar king he ain't doing anything
❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
TEAM GODZILLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Time arrived end March 28 or 29
I feel that not everything needs to devolve into a late stage Avengers movie
Looks absolutely like trash.
I did not know goku black was in this film💀
That’s very real this franchise we don’t care about the(the little girl character means stuff to me) we just wanna see Godzilla comment and save the day because we know Kong won’t stand the chance alone.
When the scar king threw the building like that it was the hype I needed
whyd they get doomfist?
You would think that after awhile they would get tired of rebuilding the city.
Asia -1
RAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Not gonna lie I feel like they made Godzilla to powerful because Kong is a literal massive gorilla 🦍 and got his but whooped by a giant lizard that shots a laser beam and that to me seems unrealistic because just a regular gorilla is insanely strong
This is gonna be epic!
Man Kong getting old I see
Here before One Godzillian Views 🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:07 was godzilla on a diet? 😂😂😂
😮😮😮😮
Apes and humanity - it's also over, we R mapes and we r destroing planaet, Godzilla is like a Picolo to GoHan
Godzilla is a protector of nature - the talk is over, period.
Trapper and Bernie remind me of Roman and Brian from fast and the fruious
The Iron Fist Is Insane 😆😁
Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be epic.
Next movie would be fast and furious GodzillaKong this is getting ridiculous  🙄
MSheU can feel it. MCU... DCU... they can feel it too. Something is coming.. Something even they are afraid of....  The hype...... 🔥🔥🔥
godzilla x kong good thing there are freinds
I’ve loved g Zilla and Kong my whole life
Thats giant gauntlet of barbarian king
Oh look, a king kong Godzilla movie where they team up together
I'm definitely watching this in theaters
Cant wait. I ❤ movie CG
So we got kong with the infinity gauntlet, Godzilla at super duper saiyan rose and crack head George 😂
20 days to the biggest clash of 2024
Will there be a son of kong 2 movie in 2026
Diz aint a movie it's the truth!!
According to sources, we might be getting Mothra back as well. The ultimate dream team reunited.
Cobalt 😂
is it just me or does the Godzilla scream at 2:33 kinda sound like moistcritical scream?
The Godzilla river walk - Godzilla is said to be over 400 feet tall, but on that river walk - he looks like 100 feet.
If they merge like Goku and Vegita then I'll stand up and scream KAMAHAMAHAAAAAA!!!!
Godzilla 2014 was the best. The director showed how Godzilla was meant to be.The next Godzilla movies kind of lost it. They made Godzilla run and do stupid moves. Its gotten worse with this 2024 version when i see the trailers. Godzilla is an anti-hero. Don't make him cartoon character.
This is going to be Totally Lame!!
Nobody talking about Mothra's reflection in the girl's eyes ar 0:29??
Robot kong
😂
Kong:Kong gets to see that he is not the last of his kind Godzilla:still the last of his kind no matter what  My reply to legendary:when is Godzilla not going to be the last of his kind anymore Godzilla I feel bad for him not see another species of his kind and that is sad legendary make Godzilla not be the last of his kind kong gets his spices but Godzilla he doesn’t see another species of his kind
When is Godzilla not be the last of his kind anymore?
The movie of the year
Kong meets Planet of the Apes? Okay, got it👍🏾
BRO WE NEED MOTHRA AND RODAN WHO WANTS IT TO HAPPENED?!?!! 👇👇👇
Kong with the Thanos glove
I am very excited for this movie name Godzilla x kong the new Empire  wow what a fantastic destruction movie looking amazing
IMO, Mothra got a bum deal in previous film. Could’ve done so much MORE, IMO. My Dad used to have an old 8 mm film projector in the 60’s and we ‘d watch an old  Rodan & Godzilla movie over & over. Big fan of Kong as well. The world always gonna need more Kong.
So now godzilla identifies as a female or what? Got pronouns?
They need to make movies set in prehistoric times🔥🔥
I don’t have more like 😢
I CAN TO WATCH THIS
Ish movie mei Godzilla aur kong saath mei Kam karenge 😅 0:25
So Shimo came before Godzilla?
Not sure that I've ever seen Godzilla actually run before.  Also Kong has to have been playing fallout because that's a powerfist.  That was actually terrifying the two of them.  They mad.
“We’ve made some minor augmentations.”  I was hoping for an EXTREME CLOSE UP of a red eyeball flickering to life (homage to Terminator)…  CUT TO BLACK. MECHANIZED ROAR!  CUT TO ALL CREATURES FIGHTING…
Super Saiyan blue to rose 😂
This is going to be epic❤
I've know of "Buddy Cop" movies, and this give me "Buddy Kaiju" vibs
this is just a beginning, next we can see a full suit of iron-kong
Omg I can’t wait to see this movie I’ve been dying to see this new trailer
Plzzz stop reveal promos
I hope that in this film, Godzilla and Kong became friends🦍🤝🐉
godzilla and kong running together looks awesome
If Kong and Godzilla don’t fist bump after defeating everything, I’m going to be disappointed
its very good movie
Did some notice shimu when kong punched scar king i saw his face in 2:27
IM HYPE AS F . CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE ON THE BIG SCREEN
😢
I have the toy
WOW😮
At 2:30 do you think the humans are intentionnally charging up Godzilla to help him fight ?
2:27 As a Kong fan i’m sold 👍🏻
i like this
Nice godzilla using super saiyan blue with 100x kaioken
We need more Kong power like god of  thunder ⚡
Ayoo kong is more powerful than Godzilla
Lets count how many battles we will see in this movie  1.Godzilla vs kong egypt fight 2. Kong vs skar first fight 3.Kong vs shimo solo fight 4.godzilla vs shimo solo fight somewhere 5.shimo vs skar fight in the beginning because we will get to know how skar controlled shimo so there will be a battle 6. Slight chance of ghidorah vs shimo fight before he died to show that shimo froze ghidorah 7. Team up fight in the end  This movie is filled with action
theres gotta be another 2nd villain were scar king and kong and godzilla have to defeat together
It's great to see Godzilla still having his thermo blast
❤❤❤❤❤ I love this  too much
I can’t wait for it to come out
Love the power up’s ❤
I hope shimo whips both of them, she is the mom of all titans
Go watch goji center explain this
❤
❤

I'm old school I am always gonna be KONG I'm a mammal I eat lizards during day they are weak cold blooded
So now godzilla is now female godzilla?
Ngl this looks hella good and this might save the movies rn cause nothings really that good
Can’t wait til they make a movie like this with no humans. Humans always make it woke and fkn bullsht. The best parts of movies like this are when it’s on the animated characters. I never seen anyone talking about I loved that part when the human did this or that it’s always damn when kong did this or Godzilla did that. Just stop 😅
This 3D Movie???????
I wonder when these first godzilla and Kong movies were coming out, you showed or at least explained THIS one to them, how they would react.... (*Insert Simpsons meme of Flanders being given the choice of going peacefully of kicking and screaming ina straight jacket*)
There must be another godzilla type thing and that orangatang monkey
Am I the only one who wanna see Rodan and Mothra return?
0:31 look Godzilla and Shimu were fighting 😳🔥
That time when Donkey Kong teamed up with Bowser . They can’t be serious.  Is this from the creators of Sharknado? 😂
I can’t wait for this movie
No way shimos eyes apeard
They just get more stupid, their desperate attempts to milk the last dollar from this dead series.  Sigh.
Kong has Veronica
New Powerful villain? it can only be Destroyah, SpaceGodzilla or maybe Shin-Godzilla????
2:07 Godzilla: Keep up with me you brat! King Kong: Don’t tell me what to do you old fossil!
That 'OHHH MY GAWDDDD' sounded so real
Can someone please explain why Godzilla is red
Jaladi se coment karati hu like milega
🔥
Love how.k9ng n godzilla is working together always wanted to see this
I d love to be a kid and enjoy those
Hats off to the CGI artists that keep making these movies. You da real MVP’s
Next is Godzilla and Kong vs Optimus prime and megatron lol
I love how crazy Godzilla emerges from the hole 🕳️..... My hero
31 sec The Real War!!
Опять чушь какая-то
Netflixe gelirmi
❤❤😢
2:34  Why did big g sound like that or that was a different sound
Though I don't like the direction these films are going these days, I'll probably still enjoy the movie. I just feel that their trying to turn them into superhero's.
Bilaa uzbila yumi
Just wow..big screen stuff 😮
They sure make some pretty stupid movies nowadays 😂
scar king is going to get killed by shimo just watch
soundd effectt☠️☠️☠️☠️
When i saw the iron fist at first near the pyramids I thought transformers are also in this movie. 😆
Love the PS2 cutscene level CGI in this one
fight!!
Can wait… gonna be so amazing
these movies look so dumb 😂
Why they always nerf godzilla my boy😭😭😭
Here's a conceptual outline for a series of Godzilla and Kong movies that subtly hint at SpaceGodzilla's existence, leading up to a climactic reveal in the final film:  **Film 1: Godzilla: Echoes of the Void** - **Plot:** Godzilla battles a new Titan that has emerged from the depths of the ocean. Monarch discovers alien DNA within the Titan, suggesting extraterrestrial origins. - **Hint:** Post-credits scene shows a meteorite heading towards Earth, with a faint, sinister roar echoing from within.  **Film 2: Kong: Hollow Earth Sovereign** - **Plot:** Kong defends his dominion in the Hollow Earth against invading creatures. He discovers ancient murals depicting a battle between Godzilla's ancestors and a mysterious cosmic entity. - **Hint:** A Monarch team studying cosmic radiation picks up unusual signals resembling the alien DNA found earlier.  **Film 3: Godzilla: Rise of the Leviathans** - **Plot:** Godzilla faces multiple Titans rising simultaneously around the world. Monarch theorizes they are being awakened by a powerful external force. - **Hint:** A crystalline structure is found on one of the defeated Titans, unlike anything on Earth.  **Film 4: Kong: Apex Predator** - **Plot:** Kong encounters a new threat in the Hollow Earth, a creature that seems to be a corrupted version of Godzilla's species. - **Hint:** Monarch uncovers a link between the creature and the meteorite, which is now closer to Earth.  **Film 5: Godzilla X Kong: Battle for the Cosmos** - **Plot:** The final showdown. As the meteorite crashes, SpaceGodzilla emerges, threatening all life on Earth. - **Hint:** Throughout the movie, flashbacks and Monarch's research connect the dots, revealing SpaceGodzilla's backstory and its ties to Godzilla and Kong's lineage.  This approach allows for a gradual buildup of mystery and anticipation, with each movie contributing pieces to the puzzle of SpaceGodzilla's existence, culminating in an epic confrontation that ties together the entire saga.
COOL 😎
Kong and Godzilla is the best monster movie this universe has ever seen !
F
Movie release date
Kong and godzilla are like homies now fight together run together 😭❤️
0:54
Lets be honest the series should've ended in godzilla vs kong
Godzilla Rosen Krone.
Godzilla is the *John Wick* of monsters.... Mark my words! He'll be totally frickin legend walking around with nuclear missile looking like a giant sized #2 pencil!
❤❤❤
Nope! I'm just waiting for *Godzilla's* very first worldwide *comedic* road trip.... It'd be epic to see *Kong* and *Godzilla* globe trotting.... Maybe visiting *Gamera* at Tokyo drinking Sake at Mt. Fuji....
1:41
Haven’t commented yet but This is absolutely my favorite trailer It’s so cool I honestly have no care for the cgi It’s fine What makes this film even cooler is we have a original villain this time Actuslly 2 original villains  This honestly will be a great film
Pls don't release too much promos about the movie
I love Godzilla and kong
First trailer:😡.                                                         New trailer:😎
So much hype for Shimo!!!
I cant wait to see this at the theaters it's going to be lit
I see godzilla got longer arms
lizard man is cool
Looks a bit too much like a Michael Bay Transformers movie. Gonna pass on this one.
If mechani-kong isn’t in the film we riot
YEAHHHH
are they gonna kiss
Subscribers 🇮🇳 like 🇵🇰 cammaed 🇦🇪 1..2..3.. ❤❤
What other kaiju lives underground and looks like a giant bug and has drill arms hmm??
So they have completely ruined everything
Yooo i know this has already been said 1mill times. Gotdamn that Godzilla&kong charge hit me so hard! made me poot FR lol
1:55 I think this is the real voice of Shimo as she is similar to Godzilla so when Godzilla shoot his atomic breath you can hear his screaming sound if you watch GvK when he drill through hollow earth you can hear his scream when he use his breath. Also 2:31 here you can hear the same scream that is replaced by Godzilla 😮
Can’t wait 🔥
this looks really good
STUPIDITY at its finest!!!
Eehh… Barney X donkey kong, Titanus DOUG, and Diddy Kong Vs Ice Spice and ORANGUTAN.
Why did they show Kong and Godzilla as the same size Godzilla is way bigger than Kong
Godzilla x kong: The New Empire is the Peak of Monster-verse 🔥
Những tác phẩm điện ảnh quốc tế luôn ẩn chứa những thông điệp tương lai.
1:26 did anyone else heard that?
Godzilla et king Kong, mets je vois que king Kong à une main qui ressemble beaucoup à king kori et que godzilla c'est déjà battu dans le passé avec grendizer quand Paris était dévasté,il reste plus qu'un seul espoir grendizer (Goldorak) j'espère encore une suite 😁 godzilla vs grendizer (Goldorak cette fois ci,il est pas interdit de rêver😁 ) cordialement
King jumped in that portal like it was nothing 😂
I love how Kong looks older. They actually made his fur gray. Nice touch.
Cool I can’t wait to come out
Now just sprinkle in some transformers and Dwayne Johnson and I'd say we have ourselves a HIT 😂
Let’s gooo🔥
MonsterVerse > HeroVerse
Love it and waiting for it
.... yeah i will wait till it's on demand.
Super saiyan pink godzilla
Barbirzilla
Monkey vs  monkey Lizard vs lizard  EPIC🔥🔥
big lizard and big monkey gonna duke it out together like a WWE cage match.
Kinda get a Godzilla 2000 design vibe from Godzilla with the violet color
THIS IS GOING TO BE FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Looks cool af but so much going on story wise it’s hard to follow.
Way better than any marvel movie 😂😂😂
the great apes became the protwctor of humanity? then why cant they just put the monke into the prveious fight with all titans ? 🤨  i hate that women
Bro I got my exams coming on march 26 or 27 it'll be too late for me to watch this epic movie
Nah let them cook🔥
its all fun and games until Godzilla charges up his Kamehameha
Alright so it is proved that godzilla will achieve the pink electrical flow of power later in the movie and not just instantly just appear as ssr randomly and not logically
This “Monsterverse” really has the potential to be the next fast and furious type of franchise where there’s endless movies will coming out, only difference is people will actually want to see them
23 days to go
Godzilla And Kong Movies should all have teasers to Spacegodzilla until they reach final movie for phase 2 to show him like Thanos.
"Kong can't stop this on his own...He won't be alone" is the new "We need Kong....the World needs him" 😂😂
2 hours of big creatures beating the daylights out of each other, sign me up!
Soooo if skar king is bigger and stronger than Kong and Shimo is twice Godzillas size and more powerful how can they win.    Wait I'll tell you skar king loses control of Shimo gets frozen by shi.o and broke into pieces ooooos. Did I spoil it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gosh he more insane he might be stronger to thermo nuclear
Godzilla super Saiyan 6 transformation, Kong infinity gauntlet, George the villain and Shimo the iceman from xmen 😅 it's gonna be epic finale 😅
good
The best duo
There is absolutely nothing wrong with a CGI filled 'turn your brain off' movie.
The litle kong is very big,  maybe he is the scar king like a transformation??
I can not wait to see the king kong in action. Release it quick
什么猴子大战，服了
Audio track is something.... Amazing @ 2:52
I feel like these comments are trolling me
Hey a real movie in theaters. That’s crazy
Saw this trailer on IMAX when we were waiting for a movie to start. The SOUND IS AMAZING! Especially when Godzilla starts powering up its nuclear breath 💀  Definitely worth watching this on IMAX
Is it real
I hope this is gone
The whole series is lit🔥🔥
I AM FEELING EXCITED AND PROUD TO SEE THESE THINGS IN MY LIFE ❤💖
Çok büyüleyici, bu fragmandan dolayı filmi izleyen ilk kişilerden olabilirim. Bu filme şimdiden puanlım 10/10
Wahhh lebih berkembang d banding yang pertama
Scarkin is my favorite Kaiju and i like the fish bone whip
Scarkin is my favorite Kaiju and i like the fish bone whip
Scarkin is my favorite Kaiju and i like the fish bone whip 😃
Shimo In GODZILLA x KONG THE NEW EMPIRE
SHIMO!?!?!?!?!?
I got to go see it next few weeks.
Idk I feel like these new ones are kinda cheesy. I love the fights, but the comic relief they constantly try to throw in ruins it for me. Im not invested in the humans. Minus one, on the other hand, was perfect. You know the writing is good when you're fine with godzilla being off the screen until he appears. They need to make the human actors more memorable and ease off with the quirkiness.
At 2:30 is that godzilla or the other monster
this is either gonna be epic or a huge disappointment.. lets see
1:43  2:09 1:44 1:45 2:27  2:43
Omg simo bhi h bhainchooo🥶🥶🤯🤯🤯
Did Godzilla went woke
I love monstervers movies
That's super awesome
No i like blue Godzilla much more
Still feel Kong could of been a standalone movie with Scar King in the hollow earth... And Godzilla could of been standalone VS Shimu or Destroyah on top
graphics are terrible
#Kong.. The Humanity #godzilla.. The Guidance Of Nature.  Seven7 Sacred ❤ Heart.
#kong... Is The Humanity  #godzilla... The Guidance Of Nature   Seven7 Sacred ♥ Heart
So basically Kong and Godzilla are fighting there own kind..
2:53 is probably the scene right before credits roll
cool
It's like watching Avengers vs evilm Avengers🗿
Imm sooo excited!!! 😮😮😮😮😮
King kong 2005 kitna amezing movie tha. .. fir barbad kr diya
Majak bana k rakha h vosri k
1:41 “And for another, we have the Kong.”
I am Godzilla side and I am kinda of mad that they made Godzilla's size so little. Not fair
Godzilla looks like a Super Saiyan rose. Kong has the infinity gauntlet in his right hand.  “They may not have to like each other, but they must work together.”
A God and a King working together to save their domains. I almost feel bad for anyone who goes up against these two.
wish Hollywood would just just go back to make them in there separate universes but its Hollywood baby
Plz do pubg x Godzilla collaboration again 😢😢😢
baby kong.....bahahahahaha
Story getting more stupid by the day
Does anyone else wish they went a different route with this franchise? I really enjoyed the first 2 Godzilla movies because they capture scale and movement very well. Not to mention, the anticipation and buildup had an almost horror like element. Then godzilla vs kong came out, and now this one, and i find it so arcade like and over the top.  Maybe it's an unpopular opinion, but I'm curious if others feel the same.
why do all the lead girls cut off all their hair when they make a second movie
Hay guys who here a Godzilla fan and a king fan
These movies are making Kong into a Punk
25 DAYS UNTIL THE MOVIE…
So it’s like Batman vs Superman but with monsters lmaooo 😂
The scale of these creatures always messed up for some reason
wow
It's like watching Bowser and Donkey kong
Is it just me or does it feel like my boy Godzilla is going to sacrifice himself in this one?
bro has infinity stones 💎💎💎💎💎💎
i think mothra is back ?!
Looks pretty dumb. Especially compared to Godzilla minus 1. This  movie looks confused.
2:47
Shimu revealed
Ultimate film😊
the way Godzilla run like human is ridiculous. you should see Jurassic park and learn how T-Rix was moving and running  and do the same
Poor Quality VFX and many technical issues, feel like very low budget VFX film.
This is going to be a banger
Mind benging trailer
Wait is mothra going to be back😮
Godzilla is going to be faster, stronger, and most importantly, stronger together with kong ,ya know
No… just, no. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Filmin guzel oldgu onceki serilerinden belli

2:27 that punch was personal bro
WE NEED MECHA GODZILLA BACK!
Together again!!!
These are the kind of movies i like to watch after turning my brain off.
Esse filme é top 👏🏼
It’s not an infinity gauntlet you morons. It’s a device to give him feeling and strength back into his arm after being blasted by freezing blast.
I hate everytime you say this is bigger threat  and make yourself seen bigger. Sometimes elevations cannot workout alone everytime  Godzilla 2014:- something responded Godzilla vs gidhorah:- he can sense his presence, bioauccustics Godzilla vs kong:-  there is something that's provoking him Godzilla new empire:- the can sense something big is coming
Bring rodan 🔥🔥🔥
“Is that a mini kong?” No sir that’s donkey
Godzilla never gets old yahoooooo😅😅😅
Why Kong is getting more than Godzilla
So Godzilla goes super saiyan and Kong gets a power first. Wooooo!
Love that the gauntlet give kong his electric abilities in a way that makes sense
Thankyou Warner bros for making such a wonderful movie again. You never disappoint us🙏 it hits hard
🫰
The scene 2:06 when Kong Godzilla rise up together that was epicc
Cok guzel bir film herkesi filmi izlemeye davet ediyorum
godzilla was never a monster or animal. it's a force of nature like volcano eruption, tornado, or all other natural disaster. you can never fight it.
Super movie
So in 3049 Godzilla will basically have a flexibility of a real lizard😂
Cok iyi ya
Kong is my favourite character 😊
Count me in. This is the monster version of WWE. GO GODZILLA X KONG! ❤
Curious George would smash them
stupid sound effects. Cheap thrills.
Music video
Kongs got Stormbreaker and Infinity gauntlet
This movie looks epic
Anyone else feel like they've already seen the movie after watching the trailer?
Wow what a weak storyline.  You guys need to go see Godzilla Minus One This is hot garbage
That's awesome, can't wait to see it!
I’m watching  Release date
You just wait it will all happen in end days of earth than it will be no fun for you
I just saw this preview on tv and saw Godzilla running from king kong.  this made me lol.
King kong and Godzilla for smash
We got Godzilla and kong fighting a giant orangutan before gta 6
i saw ice attack what kiju has ice attack
Goku and Vegeta looking solid together 🔥
I don't understand how there is a wide enough audience to fund any of these kong/zilla movies.  This youtube comment Im writing right now has more depth and complexity to its narrative than any of these movies.  And that's not the writers' fault per se. It's just a dead end genre.  Oh big animals exist and they fight things.  OoOOOoOOOOH.  Like.... it makes 80s action movies look like Lord of the Rings tier movies
Zzzzzzzzzzzz
Why does Godzilla charge up sound like moist critical meme😂
I wouldn’t see this even if it was a free screening…
Man, I'd 🫶 to take my Grandson to see this, if it was okay with his Dad, but he's only two! It might scare him. 😱  What I've been doing instead is buying all Godzilla and Kong movies in 4k❗️❗️❗️  My Grandson's gonna know what the REAL WARRIORS of the Monsterverse were like, from the old 60's versions of KK & GZA to the newest and latest....CAN'T WAIT FOR THE 29TH....
Frost lizard vs goji
I Really hope Godzilla kills ! that stupid overgrown monkey this time !!!
Can't wait
I wonder in future Godzilla x Kong movies - we are going to see Kong getting thought how to use Nunchucks - teaching them on a big screen, and Godzilla being more lethal with his forearm blades.  60's and 70's Godzilla movies has made a return - Kung Fu Style.
I wonder if Caesar and his army will help kong ?
I loved Godzilla 1 and 2, but this one is definitely going to be GARBAGE.
The Monsterverse has come a long way.
The best part of being a Dad of a 5yr old son is reliving all the best parts of your childhood.  We will be watching this in theaters!
1:52
Wow I can't wait this is going to be lit 🔥🔥🔥‼️
Frozen godzilla?
the best moveever
I saw the trailer at the cinema, and I must say, this movie looks 100% idiotic.
Gidzilla vs kong, "we need kong, the world needs him" godzilla x kong, "kong can't stop this on his own"
Cant wait, cant wait, cant wait, CANT WAIT!!
I don't care what anyone else thinks. I live for these movies where I can turn my brain off and watch kaijus do marvel stuff
just stop making these wtf
cgi looks awful
2:34 wth Godzilla!?
the iron fist is insane🥵🥵🥵
Idk ... I feel like its just a one big cringefest ... Cool looking CGI and corny story.
So the dog with baseball bat is the villian ,cool
Oh My god
shimo 😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤
Çok iyi ve aksiyon dolu bi film bu arada herkesin izlemesini kesinlikle tavsiye ederim 👌
ゴジラ瘦せた？
Ok so I just got into this verse, I keep seeing people mentioning the name shimo, anyone care to shed some info on who and how powerful
😁From 🇮🇳
Gozdilla öyle bi güç merkezi ki
0:31 Shimo vs Godzilla on right hand side
Mja Ane vala h
Kong got that one rhinestone glove.
The way Godzilla and King Kong emerges from the ground 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mini cong is cute 👇
This was a chilling trailer
Godzilla vs Kong No matter who wins . . . humanity loses.
I wonder will the connect the portals with Pacific rim
This is getting more stupid than Transformers
Will *KIRYU* 's going to make it to *MONSTERVERSE* in the next movies to come since *SHIMO* has Ice Crystals on her back and is an ICE TITAN that will serve as the key towards *KIRYU* 's existence im the *MONSTERVERSE* franchise? I'm having a wild insight of the possibilities!
I am so excited waiting 29 March release date in India 😅😅😅so happy
Kong punched scar king harder than mecha Godzilla
Zor
This looks crazy stupid but I LOVE IT!!!!! Gonna be wild watching it in the cinema hahah
A monster movie of a gorilla and irradiated lizard teaming up to fight other giant gorillas is what the world needs in 2024. While this movie will probably not be hailed as the greatest piece of written fiction in our time, it is good that Godzilla is in the cultural zeitgeist again.
Big monke rode lizzid
New Kong dude with the whip enslaved godzilla somehow and kong has to free godzilla then take him down. With some humans involved. Boom! I'll still watch it though
Godzillayı her zaman severim bu baya farklı ve güzel olacak
❤️❤️👏👏
pause in 2:27
saya ingin menjadi godzilla
Amazing , i cant wait
can you make godzilla powerful than godzilla earth
Idk why but i was like the only one who said when i watched the first trailer, Godzilla and Kong fight again. I didnt see anyone else say it
That run of Godzilla and kong gives me chills🤯
One of the best trailers of all time🎉🎉🎉
Samuel L Apesons best role yet
Perfect ❤❤❤
1:15 when I ask him how the acids hitting
THE PLOT THICKENS YET AGAIN....
A beautiful movie with action and adventure and very wonderful stories. My rating for it is 8%10

Shimo'yu görünce yüzü "Beni bu büyük ahh buz kırıcıyla karelemelerine imkan yok" gibiydi. 💀
I am amazed on how the world has evolved. This is the same kong.
hope next movie gamera is there because gamera is strong also and my favorite before 🤟🤟.
The scene of Godzilla exploding out of the ground, joined by Kong as they rush towards the camera...all I can say is 😍.
I hope WB doesn’t become another disney. Because I am done with them.
2:34 I think this is the actual Thermo Nuclear Godzilla but without Mothra's help .Damn that scream is like a kid raging in the mic
Scarking has like a spider man webshooter
Its they're fucken radio stupid the millenniums fucken eyyyyhiii
Back so it's flex glass assed
Animals
Wait did kong just knock dude tooth out 😅 😂
Deer squad the movie official trailer may 29 2029
Deer squad the movie trailer 2029 ♒️kai ♌️rammy  ♐️bobi ♍️lola
at 0:30 u can see mothra in her eye reflection
Shimo
Stop on 0.31 sec you'll see 4 titans 1 is still mysterious
0:31 2:26 2:13 1:53 0:06 Slow down to 0.25x or whatever you like to see Shimo for a longer duration before pressing these buttons
Vay jala Cobalt bleee
😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
So they fight Bambi.
Godzilla is the best 🔥🔥
So we got Kong with his own inner Thanos and Godzilla going Super Saiyan Rose on everybody.
Let's be honest kong is a beast in his oh right so is godzilla but godzilla Willa murder hong
I wonder if they will ever make movies about the other monsters, like Mothra or Rhodan.
Godzilla: SUPER SAIIYANNN ROSEEE!!!!
I never knew that thanos would be fighting with goku black super saiyan rose together to beat super saiyan goku
I’m definitely gonna go see it. I recently watched Godzilla and baby Godzilla. I love the old Minster movies.
Godzilla Minus One stomped this movie before this one came out.
THIS IS GOING TO BE INSANE
Did anyone hear the king kong vs godzilla theme pattern in the clicks of kong's glove?
Is Godzilla shin? Sorry I relate purple Godzilla to shin. I'm tryna keep up with my son lol
Godzilla 🔥 movie 🎥🍿🎥🍿
Kong turned into kratos bruh😂😂
Ugly af. Someone know the budget ??
❤
I don’t like that the monster verse focuses to much on Kong 😢
Things movie goers will.never get tired of:  1) -Marvel- 2) -Star- -Wars- 3) Kong and Godzilla !!
Godzilla trailers always give me chills I can’t wait!
Is it just me or they made Godzilla look very skinny
Now , This is a movie I am looking forward to 👀.
Omg i am so excited
Godzilla is cooler
So is Godzilla the flash now ? They keep buffing his speed, next movie he’ll be able to move at light speed
Kongptimus prime
1:08 monke jump
I love this trailer 😊
Imagine Robocop telling Thanos “Dead or alive, you’re coming with me.”
1:48 THE TRAINSITON WAS SO CLEAN I CANT WAIT FOR SHIMO AND MOTHRA TO APPEAR THIS WILL BE BADASS
The fact that it will release on my birthday
The eyes on 1:54 they are not of godzilla.who was it?😮
Water World, Transformers, Willy Wonka, and Mighty Joe Young vibes.
😴💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤
What is the beneficial purpose of Godzillas evolution of those Pink dorsal plates? Would it maybe be a defensive trait to combat being frozen from Shimo's Ice breath?
Should be a way better plot 🦖 &🦍 team up to save the 🌍 boring 🥱
THE EMOJI MOVIE 2 2026 JULY 31
2:30 COBALT 🗿🗿🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 UZBEKISTAN CAR
the CGI effects look incredibly bad.
hmmmm no mexican't in the movie easy pass for mi and conchita
Mothra is gonna be in this right
Getting weird trying to mix past movies like transformers and planet of the apes into this
Godzilla is awesome he is like a super sayian
Godzilla turned barbie and king got infinty gaunlet
Watching this 3 weeks later. Had no idea it would be coming out this month.
I love the design I just hate the stomach
Cool
Yep
Why did they bring back the annoying humans 😬
I am still not watched any Godzilla movie. Tell me something about this movie
All the highlights of the movie so far: Godzilla and Kong running together Kong riding Godzilla Kong getting jumped on Godzilla jumping off a cliff Skar King getting thrown around by Godzilla and Kong like a tennisball Godzilla upper cutting/ mario jumping Scylla
Soooooo sick
😮😮😮😮😮omg
nahhhhh i cannot wait to watch this movie !!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The batman and Superman movie we always wanted 😂
It looks so amazing ! Like wow
Kinda strange first kong gets hit by atomic breath then godzilla is attacked by humans and then they work together?
Bro it’s a sponsored now yay
Because u have to go bigger  Hopefully if their is another movie we can finally see the besy kept secret
Warner bros y'all the best this movie looks so so cool 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
I can't wait until this movie comes out
who gonna win? team Godzilla or team Shimo
Now this is going to be epic popcorn monster battle flick of the century.  Who cares how stupid the story is, im all in in the fights.  Lets go baby.
Its it out yet
if the movie sees itself as trash, it could be absolutely epic
Who were supporting Godzilla and Kong  Like 👍👍
Kong had the god of war axe,now he has the power glove.🙄😒 they ruined this franchize with these corny stories,why even have the deaf little girl she serves no purpose as before sheesh..skull island is the best out the series all the others can just get scrapped.
Seeing them run side by side is hella dope
Godzilla x Kong and Deadpool and Wolverine are the messiahs of 2024😎🎉🎉🎉
They are just trying to make movie series lengthier by adding useless  villains. They should bring some one like Destroyah
Don’t mind my pfp but Godzilla goes super saiyan three against ghidorah then goes super saiyan rose and super saiyan blue in this movie?? Lmao I’m so here for it
Why they have released so soon. can't wait to see the Movie.
Godzila Godzila Godzila Godzila Godzila Godzila Godzila Godzila🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i have a question is this the same Godzilla 2019-2024
This will bring me to the theater again. Last time i was in the theater was 2019 before the pandemic
Godzilla x Kong:The New Empire is a movie is  Like no other
running scene: LETS GET THIS MF!!!!
"Last time those 2 met, it's almost the end of Kong." My bro here ain't scared speaking facts
The monsters can feel elements?
Can't wait anymore for this 😭🤌🏻
3d hota to gazab hota yaar
Godzilla should bever be moving like that. Looks far too human and too fast.
Vo hi old concept  definitely villain hi marega kabhi toh hero bhi mare
Best Trailer ever Godzilla is stronger than ever and Kong has a new weapon😮😮🤣🤜🏻🤛🏻
What a trailer❤ love this series man❤
2:26 now slow down to 0.25x and wait for a Shimo head
Ok this jumped the shark
Who will be the main villain 😅?
Looks beyond stupid, I'm gonna love it x'D
Another King Kong Vs Godzilla movie. Give me a break.
This looks like a lotta movie. So weird to think back to Gareth Edwards' 2014 Godzilla and know this is canon. Such a different tone here. Son of Kong?
Kong riding  godzilla. This is gonna be badazzzz😈😱😱😱
Wtf 🤣 so cheesy and lazy writing ✍️ like dude said SSJ Rose and Thanos… Ooof
Gorilla vs Kong
Ugh this is slowly becoming the Fast N Furious franchise 👎
DaFuq is wrong with this studio - they should off themselves. Like this is ridiculous. Time to go to pasture buds
why do these plots always feel the same
No new monsters?
The funny thing is DONKEY KONG the 5,9 gorilla punched the moon out of orbit making him stronger than any version of king kong ever
I finally understand the colonel's words in Apocalypse Now "the horror, the horror". It's to suddenly see humanity for what it is and humanity is Godzilla Vs Kong 2
Changed Godzilla energy from blue to Woke Pink? Godzilla has a Barbie moment? WTF?
For the next trial have so many more scenes like stock footage from the first 4 monstervers movies but mostly new footage all kinds of stuff and a more of the old school Godzilla kiju should have a monstervers appearance but not like a hole bunch of them for like gigan and stuff like that put him in there please but eny thing that was in the last one or that first afishel one same thing and I,m tocking about trials not the ather monstervers movies and athcors put all the scenes in this in to the movie
This looks like the best installment of the series yet.
Ngl, the last movie did not vibe with me well, it was too ridiculous for my liking, & this sequel looks like they've taken a whole new level of sci-fi-yness towards that direction.... What happened to the more grounded nature of the first 3 Monsterverse movies?? I am not looking forward to this...
I want a mini Kong, awww💛😆
god dam this looks good.
so kong and godzilla have finally spent their skill points and got some new abilities
Yes
Is that Simon peg in the back ground?
I love how the monstervers started out serious and became just crazy......I'm all for it!
At 0:31 the computer seen WB please make this a plot twist So a group of agents left from the attacks on monarch are using speacial technolgy to fight against all the titans In the end they have so much power they fight godzilla and kong  Tnen when godzilla are kong are losing shimo and scar king come and save godzilla and kong and win
Tf happened to Godzilla this man is Jiren now
So they're Introducing magical/supernatural humans?
This is gonna be so epic with kong’s gauntlet
Nothing beats 1960s Godzilla
Kong collecting infinity stones.
Cant wait
This feels like arbiter and John 117 working together 🫠
Godzilla when he sees shimo - damn that's a blue one 🩵i need to change my colour let's go pink 🩷😂
It looks like the bad guys are giant orangutans.
We are living in the era of the death of creativity.
Godzilla watched Barbie and liked it
Still wont be as good as Godzilla -1
2:28 That is destroyahs aggregate forms claw isnt it?
Come out faster I really want us to come out😡🤬
Sooo who is the bad guy that King reject? I thought I saw some eyes of sumn worse
Oh also Mothra is in the 1 second scene she is in the battle with Godzilla resting while Godzilla destroys shimu
😊
So many small and hidden details very super talented
Wow
This looks like the wrong kind of dumb.
Why does Kong jump on Godzilla’s back when they’re runners
KINGS VS GODS
Release this on 14 April
Place your bets: better or worse than Godzilla Minus One?
I love how u can See mothra in Kia's eyes
Kong goes: DORYA!
So its two Godzilla wow one is blue and pink
2:33 penguinz0 sfx meme
I can't stand the use of "x" like this. It's so stupid.
The good film
CGI trash for trash people
More news on shimo please
I just hope that during the action sequences we go back to the human characters and learn of their struggles throughout their lives.
This is so ridiculous, I love it😂
zooooor
I cant wait for march 29
Thanos monke
That looks cringe af.
How stupid
The movie is going to end with all of them in Brazil playing soccer with some Black Eyed Peas song blaring
Imagine if mechag was alive if these 3 teamed up it would be disastrous
King Kong vs Godzilla 3???
IM WATCHING THIS BRUH
Kong face ain’t want to Fyick round with Sheron 😂,, but them  minion’s style Kenuforce apes  got captain kenyu remastered 😂leading
Monkeyy gang 💪🏻💪🏻
A pink sprinting Godzilla. I'll pass and stick with Minus One.
this looks totally craptacular!
My kids will love this
I felt bad to kong when he looses his fingers😢
Property value's gonna plumet in those cities.
Keeps getting shittier every time
Yes!
CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm trying to figure out why Godzilla is running like tht🤔
That not the infinity gauntlet, that is the weapon that Joe Baker use in  Resident Evil 7: End of Zoe dlc and Godzilla's new form reminds me of Godzilla 2000 design
Blac-ks Vs Godzilla
Obamas VS Godzilla
Three monkeys two lizards and one moth and DOUG
Happy New Year 2024 #kong #godzilla As Well As Others Too.  We Are Paving The Way For The #futuregenerations And The #unborn Through Movies #thenewempire...#Yes #sincerely #indeed.. ✌🏃🏃💜  Seven7 Sacred 💜 Heart
Best movie ever!!
Eloquence on saying "What is that" I'm peaked there bruh.....
3 minutes and we still don’t even know who they’re are teaming up against.
This movie comes out on my birthday.
KONG GOT THAT FALLOUT POWERFIST HE GON DUNK
I have a strong feeling that shimo is gonna be spared and so will scar king maybe and they'll all befriend each other because for one i know for a fact destroyah is gonna come in the series soon, and it's gonna take more than Godzilla and Kong to beat him

Ngl Kong ruined the godzilla series
1:36
Дорогой человек который читает комментарии в этот момент, Будь здоров  и счастлив!!! ❤❤❤
Shimo's roar 1:13 1:25 1:56
It's crazy how the recent Halloween trilogy and the Godzilla trilogy both started out flawed, but with promise, got better in the sequel....then STRAIGHT TRASH in the 3rd installment.
yo i cant wait for ts im going with my friend
And with that we know the entire plot of the movie
Ehh wait till home release
It's freaking wild, and that's how i like it. go crazy godzilla franchise was never shy away from wierdness afterall.
I didn’t even notice Shimo at 2:13 until now…
Muito bom né
I’m still Team Kong!
My only complaint with the franchise now is The cheesy one liners they kept interjecting. It's sorta cringe and  exhausting the vibe of the trailers and the seriousness of the movies.  I'd (Personally)like if the movies progressed foward without trying to be like marvel in terms of that and cut the Modern humans & their technology from the series.
SICK!
Müll
😂
whattt they working together😮😮
Godzilla king of the monsters > godzilla kong
Will all the fast and the furious cast joins them too 😂😂😂
They turned Kong into doom first
Please bring back Godzilla's theme song. It felt off in GvK because Godzilla's entrance is not as menacing as before in KoTM
Planet Of The Apes Featuring: Godzilla
Efikkkk
Love it
Can't wait to see godzilla and kong team up and spank those monkeys.
What is wrong with you people?
its like cena orton team up against raw rosters
Is Kong and Godzilla teamed now? Or they still fighting?
That look amazing too bad super hero fatigue will... Oh it's not Disney? Man it will be an amazing superhero movie!
Bro got longer hands 💀
Was really hoping for Destroyah  or Gigan. Or maybe actually could have given Rodan more screen time if not a movie. Utter disgrace this franchise is now.
waiting for the movie.!
Are they working together
Blud kong really just ditched off the kaijuverse to go to the transformer multiverse just to break one of a transformer's hand and used it
Too many apes, I would like to bring back something like Ghidora :(
This is so stupid 😂😂😂
This IS GOING TO BE EEEEEPIC!!!
Uff after a long time there is something great to watch  Thanks for this masterpiece can't wait to watch it
I hope hiya toys make action figures of scar king and shimo
I’m so excited to see this I thought this new Kaiju called shimo was a made up Kaiju but I would love to see Godzilla’s pulse
This will be my 3rd Film in the Cinemas after Anyone But You and Madame Web, I am super excited to watch this film on March 31st in India.
Bros literally doomfist

God this series has gone off the deep end.......
O my god 😮❤
Kong got the 6 infinity stone from thanos😂
im sorry but am i the only one who thinks this looks terrible?💀
*galfok ma jiaa nambah umur makin cantik aja 😍😂*
Wait a damn minute..we can see shimu in a frame when kong and scar fights in the city..wasn’t he supposed to be more big then Godzilla ?and why he walks like a crocodile ?wasn’t he the best titan ?im so confused but also so excited to see this movie
I hope it doesn't flop like Aquaman did. All the hype for nothing
Godzilla x Kong: UwU
So uh, please take no offense.  ID4, aka idependence day with kong and zilla and other stuff involved..  I was mildly upset to see them in one film together th first time, but this had better be friggin epic and in IMAX..........
the threat is a smaller ape with a whip?!.... and kong cant stop him unless he has some tech and godzilla on his side?... uff...
These movies are ridiculous. What's more ridiculous is I understand they are ridiculous, and I still want to see it... ridiculous.
i like how the made Godzilla pink I don't understand why people hate it so much.
I need more, plus I need Jet Jaguars and Mecha Ghidorah
I hope the focus is on Godzilla
Today is the day
This is so dumb. I can’t wait to watch! 😂
I wish they did more villains that we know that new ones. Not that the new ones are bad I’d just love to see a new destroyah
M O N K E
2:43 Aint no one gonna talk about that this references the theme of King Kong vs Godzilla 1962?
This has got to be the stupidest looking movie I've seen in ages.  And there have been some real stinkers in the past 20 years.
TRASH 🗑️ TRASH 🗑️ TRASH  *Hasn’t came out yet but I already know it has massive plot holes and has underdelivered big time. Can’t wait to see every movie critic who is getting ready for this.* 🍿  *It will make a lot of money so I guess that’s a win for the company.*
This movie still hasn't come out? Minus One has made me forget all about this garbage.
KONG ALL DAY KONG RULES HE IS A BAD MATHA THAT BIG KAHUNA...🦍
It will be a greatest legendary movie to me  Because there is titanias shimo and the zilla x kong will together
I can't wait
All the other titans who bowed to Godzilla at the end of king of the monsters should turn up in battle to fight for Godzilla in this movie
❤❤❤
2:26 Shimo in the corner
Nice
0:29 mothra reflection in her eye
Let's goooo! This looks freaking awesome! I like Kong's knew infinity gauntlet (because it's cold and it obviously can do a lot) but I really love the fact that Godzilla is even more atomic than before! They about to mop the floor with scar!
0:30 mothra?
Peak hit
I hope they keep making these , makes my younger self so happy 😂
Does Godzilla gotta stop Kongs heart again? 😆 " King Kong ain't got sh**!"
Wouldn’t be surprised if one of them gets killed 🤔
Do upgrade Kong very powerful plss 🙏
The sounds making me 💦
Kong put all his points into unarmed
wow this is crazy
Woohhh was waiting for another part,, the first part between them was fantastic but this one 💪
Let them fight
Pause at 2:27 and you will see shimo looking at kong and skar king
Coblt
When realease
What happended to the perfection of godzilla 2014…
Wow ! Pretty Cool for sure !
So Godzilla and King Kong are heroes after being villains?
0:52 Godzilla
this movie may be ok cant beat japan  version
Voy ble cobalt jala 😂😂😂😂
2:27 for Shimo’s face…
Hype 💯%
look VERY CLOSELY at the godzilla explosion at 0:31. We can see 3 kaiju: Scar King, some bird or lizard at the center of the blow, and a WHITE GODZILLA on the far right.
KAIJU MOVIE OF THE CENTURY FOR SURE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow!!!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
So godzilla is listed as 113m tall and kong is about the same. The building in the trailer is about 200m tall and it only waist deep. So how tall are they?
Looks good!
Perfect Movie for my April 2nd Birthday.
why every movie wants to destroy pyramids
Video game cutscene galore!! 🤮🤮
WHERES DOMINIC TORETTO ! WITH FAMILY, THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING
So it’s 2 godzillas one with pink and one with blue radiation
KONG!
1:14  ŒǑŌÓŐØÖǑ
The look on Kong's face when he sees Shimo tells us that the Titans may already know who Shimo is and how dangerous she really is
Monster verse is better and more epic than the MCU .
still feel they should have stuck with the 2014 godzilla design. sighs.
dulu Godzilla yg jdi protector skrg kpng😅😅😅
"Hey, you're still reading this, you're awesome. Keep being yourself. Love yourself and the people you love. You're getting better every day.
Mecha Kong will be the next villain
On 29 March my birthday date 🎉😂
This movie looks like it was made for people who need instruction manuals for scratch and sniff stickers
Looks cool but unfortunately very marvely Disney-ee and I don’t think I’ll watch it. Hope they prove me wrong
this gon' be fiiiiiiiiiire
Kong gon fold godzilla this time kong gon have magical abilities and sh
I can’t wait for the pitch meeting for this! Lol
A big load of memories a chunk of it well kept in a bottle call youtube. Thx for sharing this with us all.Be blessed & safe take care.
Bro my bro scar king got cracked 😂
The ultimate Titan Tag Team!
Kong: The Winter Soldier
نوشته من مخصوصا پاك شد چون از ذهن كثيف شما گفتم هر گز مجسمه پاكى و صداقت مادر را خدشه دار نكنيد براى نوشته مزخرفتان تمام داستاهايتان دروغ و از ذهن بيمار شما سرچشمه ميگيرى خاك بر دهانتان به زير خاك برويد
I’m glad Millie isn’t in this one (she chose not to be), her character was really pointless imo…as are most of the humans in these movies
How do these movies get funding? Snore ZZzzzzzzzzzz
Just why pink 😢
Why is no one able to see THE COMPLETE SHIMO HEAD at 2:27 ?????????? Like She is just looking while mr skar gets a dentist checkup
Background score is 👍
WOW!!  THAT LOOKED EPIC !!  DEFINITE SEE ON BIG SCREEN MOVIE
What that freeze beam??//

2:34 bro has the most terrifying roar out of all of them😂
I feel like this trailer gives away too many surprises...a bit too much.  Hope I am wrong.
Nuclear Reactor is back 😂😂 another Frying is about to happen. LongLiveTheKing Aka Godzilla
Why are they so unrealistic it was cooler when they looked 100 m tall
Mothra
best movie of 2024

SCAR: bow down monkey  KONG be like: wanna teeth break
WE WANT THE SHIMO! WE WANT THE SHIMO! WE WANT THE SHIMO!

Bro.       Tell.             Kong.    Have.   The.        Robot.         Arm
Wow
let me guess, Godzilla is non binary
This is gonna be a fever dream
This is a low-key strong female character movie
Cobalt legend 2:29
When will it be out? I’m gonna watch it at SM Clark.
No one can like this comment
What's happens with the CGI 's these times..its lacks the quality thats been before..😢
Semakin keren
nice future film😮‍💨🤫🤫
I am so exited for this movie
❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🔥
Kevin Costners film, go to it. This is blah film we all know it
2:28 omg Cobalt 😮🇺🇿📈
Đù
Monarch Legacy of Monsters was so much better than these movies
It really doesn't seem like scar king can stand up to Kong in terms of sheer  strength. He's much bulkier and that punch in the trailer looked lethal hahaha
This deserves more views rhan it gets
bruh it looks like Kong is using a power fist from 40k lol
He won’t be alone.
LETS GO!!
That lady cannot act! Her saying her lines sound like she's reading them off a prompt screen live. Lol!
Imagine if Kong Meets Mothra that would be so Cool😎
godzilla and kong vs shimo and skar king
I hope we get a flash back of baby kong and see what happened to his family I think it would be cool if they add that in the movie
Hello everyone, I have 2 theories that I've been wanting to talk about for some time, I just don't know if anyone has already said it, but starting.  1st theory: why was Godzilla frozen?    In a part of trailer 2, we saw that Godzilla is blue and is entering the sea, and was very possibly going to hunt something, probably Shimu or Scar-King, but what if it was both, they met and it was 2x1, and then the shimu froze godzilla, and he was frozen for a few hours, and managed to extract radiation from shimu's ice and thus acquired a pinkish color, becoming stronger thanks to shimu, what helps with this theory is that, according to rumors, it was shimu who froze godzilla. rei-ghidorah, and also one thing that will help this theory much more is that the shimu is an alien, who with his radiation transformed all the animals around him, making them titans, and if he was him when Godzilla was frozen , he let some of this radiation escape along with the ice and thus made the mutation that made Godzilla turn pink.  2nd theory: why did Godzilla attack King-Kong? (This theory is already simpler than the other)   What made Godzilla attack King-Kong could have been a mind control crystal that Scar-King uses to control Shimu (I saw the crystal in some videos from some YouTubers)  These were the theories🙃, I hope they are reality😅
Tall giant orange skinny monkey vs short black big burly monkey with iron man gloves & huge white dinosaur with crystals on its back and very tall lizard vs short black evolved lizard with trust issues
2:27 that punch
scar king canjump better than king kong and godzilla combined
the shot of Godzilla running is so cringe, it's enough for me not to want to watch this movie ever. Not to mention in theater
They forgot orca and madey
MISSING THE LINKIN PARK OST HAHAHAHAHA
This movie is gonna be truly epic and unforgettable. I'm so excited about it. Can't wait to go to the theater to see the two giant Titans fighting together and saving the world. ❤
Why mini kong looks like skar king son ...
After thanos ...Skar king one of the popular and favourite villain
That's looks awful, so glad the Japanese are still making awesome Godzilla stuff and not this CGI trash.
This movie looks epic
this looks like absolute dogwater. straight garbage
Is this actually gonna come out or is Zaslav gonna cancel yet another fun movie
🐸🪱🐛🪲🦎🦖🐍🐊🦈 🙊🙉🙈🐵🐒🐻🐨🐗🐾
Can march 29 come any sonner🔥
That short fight between Kong and the Scar King definitely explains why Kong is given a metal attachment-like glove.
Bro kong got the fallout powerfist.
2:13 BRAZIL
Legendary never disappoints !!! Movies like the name 🔥🔥💯
Tell me why they made a kong with red hair blue eyes and a whip and is superior to the other kongs, you don't find that suspicious
Just the trailer gives me the goosebumps i was thinking what will they show us in the movie
Looks awful af
AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL GET MORE VIEWS THAN TRAILER 1
ch bin jetzt vewirrt müssten kong und gozzila nicht bei einen bbq corna trinken und dann irgendwas von Familie und beschützen laben nur um dann in einer völlig belanglosen handlung von action sequenz zu action squenz zu gehen?
IM NOT READY 🎉
New name for evolved Godzilla : punkzilla
hello
Even tho it's like having the infinity gauntlet but I'm kinda getting iron fist vibes after seeing him punch skar king with his regular fist in trailer 2
kong thanos😂😂😂
how in the world istitans gaurdians of nature
kongs got new tooth and infinity gauntlet like thanos :)
0:31 want to see shimu thank me later❤❤
Best 2:31
1:43 kong literally overpowered skar king with just one hand
We need MonsterVerse Incarnation Of Gamera to spice things up.
So its basically planet of the apes with super powers. Meh, after the previous disappointing movie, I dont think they can redeem themselves with this movie
I can't wait to watch it🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope the other Titans like Behemoth, Methuselah, Scylla, RoDan, ETC are shown again in later MonsterVerse Films since they didn’t appear in Godzilla Vs Kong. They Were In Comics and novels That could easily be adapted into movies. And we need More Doug.
If you listen closely at 2:34 you can hear shimo scream as godzilla releases a electro pulse and since we can hear shimo scream at the same time, Godzilla body is also blue like ice, which is most likely shimo’s  power. So shimo can be controlling godzilla
I love kong Godzilla even if u assume it to be same movies like before i will definitely be watching this 😂
1:57 kongtos right there with the froze axe
this Is why need bigger screens
My YouTube channel 1 video change your life 1%
Warner Bros merge with Universal pictures is bigger than Disney plus
So the little girl turned from 12 to 14?
2:29. Cobaltni koʻrganlar bormi
I comes out on my birthday🎉
This will be cool
Bro imagine if godzilla and Kong just 🤜🤛  thst would be so cool 🤑
Kong and Godzilla together epic❤❤❤
This feels childish and manly at the same time.🤣
Destoryah
Waiting for this epic movie ❤
MOTHRA’S EGG MOTHRA’S EGG MOTHRA’S EGG
Vidyut jammwal fan assemble here? Thanks for 162 subscribe❤❤😢😢😢😢😢😢
Slow Down the Trailer To 0.25x speed at 2:26 minute You Will Se The Shimo At Right Side of Screen When Kong Punches Skar King
2:12 pause and zoom into the beam you see shimo and scar king
Why watch this when you can watch Minus One again.
It's An Intrusion Of Family Affair.  (For Those Who Knew What We Meant. For Those Who Don't,  Then "If It Doesn't Apply,  Let It  ✈  Fly 🌏💫💝🏃🏃)...  The Sacred ♥ Heart.
There will be 2 Godzilla in the movie  Biggest spoiler ❤
King Kong beats Godzilla and every monster
I can't wait
As long as they keep making these, I'll keep watching
2:54  best part for sure
Most important 2:10
Why do I keep hearing the moist critical WOOOOOOOO????
is there a reason they always have to turn attractive women in to men? scientist chick was way cuter before....what a waste

#ReleaseCoyoteVsAcme #SaveCoyoteVsAcme #FIREDAVIDZASLAV
Blud where is it available on 😭
Around the 0:30-0:31 second mark, that big burst of energy near Skar King seems to grow when he slams his fists down.  I knew those glowing eyes had to signal that there was SOMETHING different about him.
2:33 wonder if those are nuke to powerup godzilla
Big sand fart 0:03
I like godzilla big beefy body rather than this skinny twig makes it feel like he lost like 200 health for more radiation power💀
Movie of the year!!!
Godzilla screaming sounds like Charlie
I thought they're gonna be friends but they're fight again why is this they're supposed to be friends right now and no rematch
did they really turn godzilla and kong into hobbs and shaw?
He not going to have the axe no more
Soulless cgi slop
So Exited to see the movie
More like godzilla x Kong w/ thanks gauntlet
Since Kong found out his species are still alive, but Godzilla, I feel bad for him
If ya look closely where shimo is shooting his ice breath into the sky, skar king is on the mountain watching him
After releasing that film, send these monsterverse Kaiju models, sounds and effects to us.
Honestly just watched godzilla vs Kong and I am so hyped for this next sequel
1:51 you can see kongs tooth missing
It seems their is two Godzillas in this movie. Why one red and one blue?
IT IS A SHAME KONG VS ZILLA GOT ONLINE RELEASE..... IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY MADE A BILLION DOLLARS......
When Suko's shadow was huge I thought it was Skar King.🤣
Godzilla and kong have work together one more time
1:50 shimo!
I know you’re working on  Godzilla Kong, the new Empire but also want to make a movie and I want your help
Even the trailer is fascinating.
I saw Shimo’s Ice Breath
Give us the Final Trailer please
Warner Bros
Kong got the power glove!! Nintendo what??
As long as there is a heroic teenager or some heroic gender mental saving the world, i m off to somewhere else...yikessss... A VERY old Hollywood formula...
The best to Godzilla and kong
Sigh. Did I just watch the whole movie
మరోకసారి ఇద్దరూ కలిసి రఫ్ఫాడించబోతున్నారు 🤩🔥👏🏼🥵👌🏼
Its for sure palpatine's clone
I have never seen Godzilla run!❤❤❤❤❤
Please i need doughgoji come back after the final battle
The Monsterverse is taking over, it used to be Marvel up untill Endgame and DC had its moment with Zack Snyder's Justice League because that was actually leading to something great with Darkseid but now it's Monsterverse
Vay amisinakoyum
0:31 0:30
2:27
I'm very excited to be honest, we want a new part of Pacific Rim🙏

do you think kong could eat a donut? he needs a gun
cant waittttt
this is epic
Kong and Godzilla together!!! Woahhhhhhhhhh
When the Villains are Overpowered then love to see the movie❤❤❤❤ Love from india❤🎉
It's funny how it sort of gives the "Kong is fighting the Skar King, and Godzilla and Shimu are there too." vibe.
It would actually be super sweet for this to debut on Valentine's Day, with Godzilla sporting his pink color in support for it.
🔥🔥 I am youtuber 🔥🔥 🤩👉 मैं youtuber हु  Mera tech channel hai👈🤩 👉Mere channel se aapko help ho sakti hai👈 🔥🎉🔥🎉Nice video 🔥🎉🔥🎉
Kong became Thanos wtf
Actually these skar armies are the same size as kong or even bigger, so imagine these monkeys rumbled the world like what Eren did in AOT final
2:27
Priyanka chopra
OMG Godzilla! He's big, scary, and PINK!
No way shimo is here!!!!
Goosebumps 🔥
I'm sick of disabilities in movies. It's just a boring emotional bait.
Tbh 24 million views on the second trailer is pretty hype
As a kid I took originality for granted. As an adult, I see how difficult it is to be Original and well liked.  So baby kong, remember that authenticity often resonates with people more than trying to conform to expectations.
Kong and Godzilla running is like there mother chasing them with a slipper ..😂❤
this will be rated 5.6 on IMDB...
Who is waiting for Deadpool 3😂.
they have to fight the balrog
ultra pro visulas and graphics use
khatarnak bhai gazab
Puras mamadas. Ya no saben como sacarle el dinero a la gente burra😆🤣

Suddenly Kong has become the Winter Soldier, lol. Does that make Godzilla Captain America?
1:14 nahh bro was that moist critical im dead ✋😭😭
Whatever
#Makethe1994GodzillaMovie   Spread the word
Godzilla सब सम्हाल लेगा tension मत लो ।
I enjoyed these as a kid and even the new ones... but its going WAYYYY out there now lol... not sure if i can get behind it.
How far can they evolve these characters?  YES 😂
hulk is the best 😅
Pink is just dumb. They have totally ruined Godzilla.  Not giving them a penny to watch that.
RELEASE DATE IS 10 MARCH RIGHT?
I’m so exited for the New MOVIE!!!
Okay can someone explain is it just me or why does the plot get even worse like some of them doesn't make any sense Did they just made it up just to make the movie looked cool like since when did the hollow earth was introduced did they made it up in gvk?
I can't wait in March 29 tHIs IS Epic
Can't wait to see it on IMAX with Lazer experience With great Audio
Alr I was hat8ng in this movie but now… I think it’s gonna be good
Skar King's roar sounds like a big guy going "WOOOO"
Can’t wait for it
SHIMU?
That looks very original and definetly not like something that has been done before.
Godzilla can run?!
Godzilla is now as tall as Gidorah
I think when this movie comes out I'm just going to watch Godzilla: Minus One again instead.
In this trailer the whole movie is in there
Say what you want but im so hyped for godzilla. They look GODLIKE with that pink energy.
Shimo😢😢😢🗿🔥
Imagine they were real💀
Godzilla and Kong make the best pair of frenemies! This and Deadpool & Wolverine are movies about two individuals working together who don’t like each other. Excited to watch this and Deadpool & Wolverine in the cinema!
cool
2:43 King Kong theme
Huh
anyone else see at 0:31 shimo is in the top right
Did that Godzilla just run?
Please tell me he got into shape to do a dropkick... PLEASE!!!
Another trailer that shows the hole movie, Thanks for saving money 👍
0:29 at this moment i see Scare king vs Kong and Godzilla vs Shimu are fighting.   Disclaimer! (Watch this on 0.25 so you can see them)
Yenilenmiş Kong şimdi daha güçlü geliyor insanların yardımıyla gozdzillayı alt üst ediyor
Piramitler güzel de içinden su çıkması saçma
El Monsterverse ha nacido para humillar a Godzilla.   Godzilla merece su gran película.
"Humanity's protective monsters."  *same monsters* "We're going to destroy the entire city to protect the people in it!"
Harika fragman ❤❤
Straight to DEI DVD
THE BIG MONKEYS IS PROTECTOR OF HUMANITY.
Heyecanlı
1:14, 1:27, 1:56, 2:33 Ain't no way I heard Moist Cr1T1KaL's "WHOOOOOOOO" here 💀
Every scene Godzilla was in gave me chills bro   I love The Big G in his two new forms
Güzel hoş muhteşem harika iyi
Cok guzel ben izledim beğenerek tavsiye ederim izlenmesi gereken tavsiye ederim ❤❤
Güzel hoş muhteşem harika iyi
Güzel hoş muhteşem harika iyi
Çok güzel olmuş
Godzilla vs Kong eğlenceli, canlı, aksiyon dolu ve enerjik bir filmdi. GvK reklamını yaptığı üzere bu ağırsıklet maçını muhteşem görsel efektleri ve şahane aksiyon sahneleriyle hayata geçirmiş. Bu film büyük bir gösteri ve izleyiciler tam da bunu alacak.
Harika bir film
👏👏
Göz alıcı sahneleri gerçek ile ayırt etmek neredeyse imkansız kral yine insanlıktan yana muhteşem bir film
çok güzel
Bu filimde inanılmaz efekler var müthiş bir flim hersaniyesi doyumsuz ve hareketli
This movie is in the top 10 among the movies I've watched.
Canavarlar ve insanlar ve savaş çok etkileyici bir film ❤
The trailer is very good
Mükemmel
Sonunu merak ediyorum 🔥💥😊😊❤️❤️
Başarılı bir yapım heyecanla bekliyorum
Hey bu evsane bir filim bence
Djdn
Çok iyi bir filim
İzlenmesi gereken bir film kesinlikle
At this point, Mothra needs to see this, her man just becoming friends with his old rival and working together, she'd be so proud
CGI looks terrible
Next part from monarch ❤❤
Kong doesn't kneel anyone💙💙💙
I saw Shino 0:31
2024 faadu jane wala hai dostooon...............❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
love hy bhai
Yo😊
Hello mothra thans mothra is back  from a egg!😊
This looks so bad haha
Is Kong have any special super power in this movie
ALGO ESTÁ VINDO!
2:52
*Lizard brain and monkey brain activated*
Yeahhh
Ayo lemme holla at my Lizard homie Right Quick
Zor
CGI look better than previous trailers.
Godzilla (1998) was the best. The new releases are sooo boring... Just battles, and battles, and battles... 0 Rich story.
Simu is comming 😈
Can you watch that movie without having watched the show?
Wow, this is absolute Trash. They didn't have enough animation budget to actually nail the scale as there is almost no frame of reference in 80% of the scenes.
Can't wait to witness this epic monster's cinematic experience
THERE COOKING A GOURMET MEAL 🔥🔥🔥
90% bla bla bla 10% kong ... godzilla... action ...
The bestestduo ever cannot wait to see❤❤❤
Blockbusters🔥🔥
Hello❤
2:43-2:45 I hear some drum beats to the KKvG'62 theme
WBs literally said, "hold my beer" this year... they been cooking🔥🔥🔥
Is it gonna release in march 29???? Pls correct me
Can it be about godzilla and kong now or does it need to have main human characters that i don't care about?
Op movi😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉
I mean I got a diving board …
What if in the clip where Godzilla is frozen he was actually frozen by shimu and lost that fight but somehow got out the ice later on
I had this weird and random dream the other day like Godzilla started attacking and the person who came and defeated Godzilla was Gojo from Jujutsu Kaisen lmao what a crazy dream
Now we know that Kong is stronger than scar
Man, first I think Kong is so cool, then I see Godzilla and he's badass then I see kongs upgrade and he's badass, then back to Godzilla... They are both badass!!!
Kong = thanoz❤🎉 lol
Shimo:haha be scared of me  Kong :you broke my axe🤬 Godzilla:oh yay i got a baby ice twin
Man watch! Man like! Man happy! Jajajajajaj
Toho & Legendary collaborated on this latest kaiju.
Please DO NOT BE WOKE
2:08
Godzilla destroying the pyramid does anger me a little.   And I don’t even know why it makes me angry.
Kong finally find his own species but is there more godzilla in the hallow earth theres a chance but its definitely 1% going to happen
Monsterverse the best thing this studio has done apart from DC+
0:30 seconds u can see mothra in her eye
This movie that more good critics
Please Bhai subscribe kar ke support kijiye ❤❤❤❤❤
This is gonna be epic.Btw did you notice shimo vs Godzilla
I am so excited for this!
Nahh man that part where Godzilla and Kong were running was not it lmao this movie looks stupid. Thank you minus one for setting the bar so high…
Cobalt borakan😂
What a foolishness the Hollywood does😂😂😂
Is anybody missing Millie Bobby Brown though?? 🥲
Oh WOW EPICNESS TRAILER. The ending of the Trailer gives me some major Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥 That's insane!!! The score is incredible, it just stands up all the hairs and pores of my body.
Godzilla x Kong x Transformers 😂😂🔥🔥👌👌
I can’t wait
All the best Godzilla & KingKong... from pspk fans!❤
So donkey kong and diddy kong gonna team up with king k rool against tokka and rahzar from the tmnt... Cant wait to see this 😂
*Already the best start of 2024*
Skar King s whip is made from Godzilla s bones.Epic
Titans wonderful
Shimo is in this right? Man am I exited to see that guy. What if skar king rides him into battle 😂😂
There we can see suko in skar king hand
I'm sayin
I will never understand why the need to add humans or have the humans be the sole focus of these movies. It's called Kong vs Godzilla not the humans featuring Kong and Godzilla 🙄🙄
I think there is 2 enemies in this movie, one is skar king, another i think its ghidorah
every time is dumber than the previous one in american cinema
Kong and Godzilla will end up having a baby together.  The Evangelical Christians will not like this movie!  😂😂😂😂😂
I’m confused so its Kong vs Zilla or Kong & zilla vs the brown monkey 🤔
I'm gonna watch it cause it's gonna be fun but man these movies get more goofy and ridiculous with each one now
Hollywood is and was always whack. This is stupid.
After watching Shin Godzilla and Godzilla Minus One back-to-back, I'm much less interested in the American kaiju series than before.    Sorry this was such a downer of a comment, I hope everyone who is excited about this movie ends up enjoying it when it comes out.
Why is kong wearing a powerfist from fallout 4?
Zeke Jaeger
Let them be old school movies. These days Kim Jong Un would nuke Godzilla by an accident.
another one. hollywood needs to make originals
The trailer gave me a headache..🚮. Hollywood writers need to go back on strike, forever. They are not good at their jobs. Woke liberals.
Remember how relatively grounded the first Monsterverse Godzilla film was?
Blockbuster hit coming🔥🔥🔥
whyd they started to run like human ☠️🗿
nonsense
Godzilla is such a powerhouse!
I am so excited for this Movie
Top de mais
seriously, the best movie of the year....
GODZILLA THE KING 👑🔥
bro this Kong Infinity Gauntlet and Superr Saiyan Rose vs some skinny Kong and a Thunder Godzilla what has they done?
Could just be me but mothra might be coming back.
Amazing
Bro Godzilla and Kong working together is tuff
Despite Godzilla Owned By Toho
Nah now they are just milking this franchise....let Godzilla and kong just be simple titans...no need for aliens and shi
Super saiyan rose & kong with infinite gauntlet    Finally they transformed
Oooo That's Goosebumps throughout 🔥🔥
Is this a film or a series?
NPCcore
What in the actual is going on
Oh my god i got goosebumps from watching this already 💯
I can’t wait
These types of movies aren't for part 2 or 3.
Kong is ruthless.  He literally tried to decapitate Godzilla with that axe a doezen times.  Thats why Godzillas' always ready to scrap wit him.  He knows how ruthless Kong is 😂😂😂
Great !! Godzilla is lgbqt+ now
Shimo was amazing
Put upgraded titan tv man and upgraded titan speaker man and upgraded titan camera man please and new enemy is GMAN TOILET and upgraded scientist toilet plsssss
Fire 🔥🔥🔥
King Kong is the greatest creature in cinema history! The power he holds, his natural strength is probably GOD’s given strength
1:42 1:52
Godzilla vs Kong vs Planet of the apes.
Kong became Thor ⚡⚡
This looks ridiculous,  what happened to cinema man wtf? The CGI looks Terrible too
Some men just wanna watch the world burn
This one might finally be good. Only good Monsterverse film has been Kong Island.
Godzilla vs shimu
That is too much of info in a trailer 😅 anyways a ardent fan of you Boss Godzilla since 1998 ❤❤❤
1:39 He has no style, he has no grace, that Kong has a funny face.
hope this movie is much much better than recent Kong game
I am waiting for collaboration with PUBGM/BGMI 😢
Bu filmda 2 ta godzilla bo'larkan menimcha
all i want if for kong to dap up godzilla
This two titans is our Last hope!🔥
एक साथ उठो
0:31
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌
Seriously though why is the lighting and cinematography so trash?
I just saw shimo in th emovie, could be a mystery most of you did not see. But shimo is literally larger, and bigger than godzilla.
Please give Godzilla back the slowness that made him truly giant and invincible.
This looks Madame Web bad.
Кто скажет, почему у Годзиллы на 55 секунде не его естественный рык?
😢 why?
its either this or deadpool gonna steal the year. team godzilla btw
Wh
Monsterverse going backwards on this one. Godzilla vs Ghidora should NOT have taken place before the GvK movies.
Can we just ONCE get a good Godzilla movie without the ridiculously cheesy plot lines?  Also, Ghidora was a fkn literal alien deity. What on EARTH is going to top a battle with an alien god?
Full goosebumps 🥶🥶🥶
What was the monster with the blue eyes? Godzilla?
Snow kong and other Godzilla might be antagonists for this maybe .🫡
Marvel has been real quite
Story looks very weak in this one
Let me guess a water bottle is going to save the day again
🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Godzilla & We Get Planet Of The Apes 2024 Starting Off Right Let's Go!!!!!!
1:51 that expression of king kong 😢
The only thing thats good about this movie is that doug and mothra make a return. All the other side characters (shimo, suko, skar king) are just terrible and are there for useless plot and fight scenes. And i see you legendary godzilla fans typing to insult me over my thoughts on this movie.
This is Endgame  Cinematic experience @ it's Peak 🔥
Legendary
I love ❤️ Monster-verse
From Avengers to endgame  Now Godzilla to Godzilla x king new empire
Since you're all going for over the top ridiculous with mons might as well make a Primal Rage movie from the game. 👍
@your_deva
Exactly at 2:13 at the video, we can see how big Shimu is. Purely in White waving its tail and shooting its ice powers towards the sky. It's in a size of a mini mountain. Might be in 200m tall and 300m plus wider. Bigger than Ghidorah.
I keep watching this trailer every day...I am so excited.
No thanks
Can’t wait for the next part when power rangers joins the fight
1:45 this has to be a warbat Skeleton
Jai shri ram🙏🙏
Very dengerous
ok, so is godzilla, good, bad, pink, blue, space godzilla, not space godzilla, weird dorsal plate or no weird dorsal plates? Trailers are so informative.
SE VE MUY XD
If an orangutan and a giant ice lizard strikes fear into both the big G and K, imagine how they’d react to Destoroyah if he was ever added.
3rd series : Godzilla Chan getting married 4th series : king's Kong rises : Godzilla pregnant 5th series : Godzilla and the struggles of nuclear babies 6th series : king kong goes for milk : Godzilla struggles as a single.
Dude I can't wait
I'm so confused ..! are there 2 Godzillas in this movie ??
Ingatkan bulan ni :(
คันปากมากเลย เพราะอยาก...
Stupid
These special effects movies are so over done already
I dont know how I feel about the way Godzilla runs.. 😩😬🥴.  Conflicted but , not a big deal.   Whatsoever.   Because then I could benshowing symptoms of woke progressive liberalism.. and would have to be euthanized. 👼
goofy ah run
Wait no skarsgard and the capt marvel haircut???? Oh noes.
I felt like this movie came out twice😅
This going to be good movie 😮
Who is shimo or shimu or even king kata??
This movie looks like a big dumb wreck.
My hairs just stood omg😮❤❤❤
Shimo and skarking omg
Shimo! Now, bring back Mecha Godzilla. ✌
We up with this one 🔥
Meh...just meh.
Im so exited for this movie!! But only 37 days left
I remember seeing the 2014 godzilla in theaters, and to me this is like metal gear revengeance. Like, is it even the same universe?
godzilla is my goat
Godzilla running like human that doesn't looks good
Я думал щас Ирина кайратовна будет 😂
Edhu kattum🔥
Gak sabar coy mau nonton😮
That 1:30  to 1:46 was awesome
0:30 1:40
So much garbled sound. And look at those shtty af graphics. Smfh
They don't look heavy enough. It ruins the scale. Looks fun though.
Seeing the new monsters make me think for a moment   Scar king is a gorilla like, and kong is a gorilla like  Shimo is a lizard like, and godzilla is a lizard like  Smth is off here
ಅದ್ಭುತವಾಗಿದೆ ನಾನು ಕಾಯುತ್ತಿರುವೆ ಈ ಸಿನಿಮಾ ನೋಡಲು 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
ゴジラvsコング新たな帝国楽しみ
Doug and suko are going to solo in this movie
This movie is going to be peak of the year
CAN'T WAITTTTTT!!!!
This is peak it looks amazing can’t wait when it comes out! Also that thing with glowing eyes was shimo
I am a big fan not even a big fan a HUGE FAN of Godzilla and I really want to no what the little monkeys name and 8 love this new movie
1:26 moistcritical wooooooo thats what im talking bout baby CONFIRMED
I am excited for the movie!
So the skinny ape is the bad guy? Not much of a challenge
2:32 why are they throwing planes at Godzilla?
Since when can Godzilla run?
Godzilla isn't afraid ❤
So excited hope we also get to see Mothra get an upgrade
Next their gonna kiss
Like most franchises...Starts kind of serious, even a little scary...slowly turns silly as the ideas run out...
I got chilllllls 😎
Im hyped for Shimo
This movie is going to be very fired dude 🔥
This movie is going to be very fiery dude 🔥
this gonna be so woke. the only white guy is the bad guy while the diversity hire are all good people. i dont want the monsters fighting like they know martial arts 😑😑
🙄
I can't wait to see how strong enough Kong and Godzilla to Save Human being 😊   Reply
Is it Woke?
2:52 oh that’s a cool shot
Legendary be cookin’
It moves me to see this
Mothra's in the trailer. Oh my god, I saw in her eyes of a deaf Iwi girl
I think the assumption that Skar King controls Shimu might be wrong. The giant apes may accidentally awaken Shimu.
0:31 skar king’s leg ridding shimo tail
This about to be epic
Stupidity 💯 💯 💯
Ok first thing king had that punch in the teeth of scar king of blood and at the end of the trailer what did I killed
Godzilla 2014 was a great Showcase of Godzilla's return Skull Island was a nice movie to watch King of the Monsters was pure nostalgia,but has it's flaws GvK was kinda disappointing And now GxK will bring the showa vibe back to theaters
BRO I HEAR MOISTKRITICAL THERE YOU WONT GET PAST ME
2:13 you can see Shimo ice freezing Mothra or Rodan
Wow thanks from the 3 min summary of the movie showing me the coolest parts
Godzilla transformed into Godzilla Rose Jesus
Goku Black is proud of Godzilla and Thanos is proud of Kong. simply epic
we really got kong with infinity gauntlet before gta VI
Something that not many realize is that it is very similar to the First Godzilla 2014 and I am referring to the cosmic horror theme.
The amount of views this mediocre racked up shows you how much we jonesing for a good escapist movie
The purple Godzilla too much 😂
What the fook is that ?
During the scene where Kong and Godzilla are roaring to the sky in egypt mothra is in there too they just removed her from the trailer
This movie looks fire 🔥🔥🔥
So the movie is going to establish lore about the Titans hierarchy and how it existed for eons, and end with a new Hierarchy with two equal leaders. Godzilla and Kong. They will end the movie with both being equal Kings of the Monsters, and maybe at the end or during the credits a new threat (most likely Space Gojira, whom will be mentioned in this movie) where Godzilla and Kong will have to unite all of the Titans in an all out war for supremacy over the most powerful Titan of them all, Space Godzilla who literally ate a star and has like 100x the power of Nuclear Godzilla.
This movie it's going to be so good  but i am thinking about that this girl her name is Jia she can't talk but she can communicate with her words 🤔
Mothra vai voltar nessa nova franquia do filme do godzilla x kong o novo império 😊
2:01 was epic
Godzilla hates bridges i think its PTSD
I dont care what no one says. Theu know theyre still gonna watch it 💀😂
2:27 you can see shimos head there!!!
2:27. you can see the face of Shimo
What the f***k did you make😮❤
This is cheezier than a tub of molten mozarella
The greatest buddy cop film ever?
This is the stupidest thing ever and I am absolutely loving it
only for children
Kong got a growth spurt 😂
Big respect for scar king and shimo 🥶
King of monsters Godzilla
0:31 🙃 (Shimu)
😢
OHH GODDD THATS FREAKING CLASSIC!
2:46 Take a look at the end of Skar King's Whiplash, there is a kind of shining/light blue stone or crystal. If you pay attention, the color is almost the same as Shimu/o's dorsal. It is possible that this crystal made Shimu/o submit and become Skar king's subordinate.
Godzilla be like:"calling all titan's calling all titan's"
Is Millie gonna be in it?
Мстители бегут... Годзилла и Конг:  "Подержите наше пиво..."
I can't wait to see.
Another Over blown over budget crapfest. Humans especially white males are evil.  Go see zilla plus one it’s a movie a real movie.
tf Godzilla getting smaller
Are studios running out of ideas?
The VFX Looks a Little Downwards than before...
Whar are you doing warner Bros. 2014 - Let them fight 2019 - we join the fight 2021 - make em fight 2024 - make a tag team and let them fight.🤣🤣🤣
Patiently waiting 😮...
disappointing
This looks bad lol
Gaming channel hai subscribe karo mat sirf dekha jaye like karo
Gaming channel hai subscribe karo mat sirf dekha jaye like kari 🎉😢😢
❤
🥱
Can’t wait
I loved the Barbie edition of Godzilla 🤌
Gosebomse ❤
Kong is still growing it did not still reach its  adult right then u will make kong heigh and powerful 2019 kong was powerful i thought gozilla has evolved then kong would also be evovled😢😢
When they are going to evolve kong 😢😢😢😢😢 only they evolved gozilla make kong heigh and powerful please please i have seen Rampage gorilla george if george was in kongs place george would be powerful please evolve kong😢😢😢🥺🥺🥺🥺
One possibility in the desert is that they are possibly sparing? or training?
🤔 No thanks! I love monster movies but I don't like the premise of this one.
Where's Millie???
Always Love Legend King Kong 🖤🔥👑⚔️❤
Violent people see violence and make violent movies , another disgusting thing
0.31 Shimu 🔥🔥
is that SHIMU AT 0:30??????
I cried after watching this how it is so good, beautiful, action and storyline. I swear this movie is going to in the list of top 10 best movies  This is a perfect 1000/1000
Palestine vs Israel
Just watched the leaked movie....godzilla fights Shimo and kong fights scar and kong defeats scar with tye help of his own whip by slicing his head off while Shimo is killed brutally by godzilla spliting him in half
This looks sick
Godzilla black pink anh blue 😂
Giant monsters go brrr 🥶
King Kong, Godzilla, Planet of the apes, and Transformers. Next movie probably they'll put SpongeBob in
I think they are destroying what kong and Godzilla stand fir the best movie of Godzilla series is first new Godzilla and king of monsters
RMB always inspire imagination. 🤭
I hope shimo actually looks good and isn’t just a Godzilla that breathes ice. He is much stronger than all titans
Who made these disgusting soundbits of the "imma fire my lazor meme" and thought they fit? Im just gonna watch Godzilla Minus One a second time.
On one hans,  I'm happy to see more Godzilla on screen. But on the other hand, I think legendary is not going in the good direction, the trailer look like it's a Superhero movie, a bit too goofy and they humanize the monsters a bit too much. I'm glad to see Godzilla and even Kong on screen but I feel like it could have been way better.
22 days until Godzilla x Kong
Hopefully shimo get some good screentime
господи какая же чепуха
King Kong is back
King Louie just mutated into skar king! And Kong thanos mode is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
this reminds me of that family guy clip, bigger jaws. "oh my god, now we have a common enemy. we have to work together"
This is a sick trailer i can't wait for it. Its probably gonna be the best movie in history!!!
Seeing kong and godzilla it's always amazing to see them together. 🔝🔥
🔥 Godzilla X Kong 🔥 +  Deadpool & Wolverine Movie , 2 Peak Movies We Will Be Having This Year 😍💙 Mann What A Time To Be Alive I'm Really Gonna Enjoy This 🗿🍷
Are film makers purposely making bad movies these days? It's too much of a coincidence to have so much garbage coming out back to back to back.
OMGGGG NEEEEEWWWWWW TRAİLLEEERRRRR4TRRR😊R😊FDGEHJEJSHEHSHEHZHHHDHHSHAJHSYDGAJSHEHH
Skar King's roar at the end sounded badass
Kong And Godzilla vs Scar king and shimo 🔥
I'm really excited that I'm gonna see an ape and a lizard vs ape and a ice Lizard
Moist Critical
Ommala 🔥 vera mari
This movie gonna be fire 🔥
EPIC 1:11
any of y'all relized the soundwave warbling kinda sounds like the moistcritical screaming meme?Fr sounds like WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The roar at Egypt was the best❤❤
So why Godzilla was exploding electric energy from his body?  Is he being mind controlled by skar king?
How can we make this better???? ADD LASERS!!!
bro i just wanna hug “mini kong”
Jesus the computer graphics look so terrible their artists must have been on crack, this is as bad as sonic
Na
Wicked Awesome
I hope that orangutan is not a boss he looks so lame.
Sobalı evimde kestane pişirirken filmin korsana düşmesini sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum.
what.. A Kong With Infiity Gauntley 😂😂  And Upgrade Godzilla With Rose Colored
Name of song?
the ice godzillaa is coming
Godzilla monster world rumble coming 2027 zilla finishes the story, becomes head of the monster table.
More like a comedy
Kong look mighty
0:21 wholesome
0:21 wholesome
Zor
Transformer bumblebee in had Kong?
Shimu is about to go off on Godzilla and King Kong. I wouldn't be surprised if Shimu turns on Scar King too. 🔥
man i miss playing warzone 1 on caldera lol
There’s morthra
mantapp
The only thing any is afraid of is that haircut😂😂
Fun fact: at 0:30 in the eyeball, you can see Mothra’s face!!!

Minus One hatte mehr Flair und Atmosphäre.
31 sec it looks like scar king is on top of kong if you really look
Really excited
Evry 5 years is new york destroyed, they make new buildings and destroyed again 😅
what i like about this trailer, kong is like the mc of the story while godzilla seems like some powerfull character that will help the mc when he lost or something hahaha
Yeamn 🦍
Very Sneaky, Mothra is actually supposed to be in the middle of Godzilla and Kong at the very last scene of this trailer. Mothra will be the reason they stop fighting each other and team up.
All we missing is the one punch man....KO
Hay que tener
Ayo desde aquí no te agua En las hojitas que echen
I can’t wait to watch godzilla and kong again 😊
Let's go 👏👍
So it's a reboot but without Black Lives Matter, basically Godzilla wins.. nice
This would probably be a good movie but definitely won't beat Godzilla Minus One.
This movie finna go crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I got so many goosebumps after watching the trailer, then after watching the movie there will be no hair left on my body.💤
March seems like an action packed movie month!
Oooff...♥️
🤣🤣🤣🤣
❤❤❤❤
00:05  The pyramids, the seven wonders of the world, Egypt is my country
Movies are absolutely embarrassing at this point. They just remake everything from the past. Smh
another special fx galore to hide the mediocre story!
When will we have godzilla movie about Ghidorahs return
Looks stupid. They lamed it up with the human drama now made this crappy peace ending with godzilla/kong.. and bla-bla-bla
Kong skull island looks 1000x more realistic, tf happened?
Why Kong in not using infinity gotlet ?
Can you thermal post?
These movies keep getting wilder and dumber😂😂😂
Scar king might be smarter with weapons but kong got strength and he bout to serve up them hands on him 😂 can't wait
Post credit sence KONG  be like :- IM IRON MAN😅
2:27
THE NEW EMPIRE!!!
Mecha Kong, I suppose it was only a matter of time
2:28 imagine he is saying this after Godzilla drop kicks shimo and does the celebration
Gojira sprinting washes the whole ominous aura off of him btw. We’re about to get shitted on…
Is it me or does “mini kong” look like a YouTube Kids rendered character?
Kong yuva sena 💥💥💥
Bro it’s wraps the leaks are coming
bro saw this in Blade ball
Bro wtf are these movies even about now 💀💀💀
This is a goood
I'm wondering if Jia has some connection to a Titan. I remember seeing a spot where she is climbing a temple and reaching out to "something". Perhaps another titan or a Mothra return?? Tune in to find out I guess.
I seriously doubt Godzilla is afraid of anything .  I can hardly wait to see this movie , it looks like it is going to be awesome .
Epic 🎉🎉🎉
boringgg, godzilla and kong? what about other monsters we want to see some exciting monsters not the KONG its just monkey damn  godzilla vs king ghidurah was perfect though.
2014 - Godzilla v Muto - Beginning  2017 - Kong v Skull Crawler - Origin 2019 - Godzilla, Mothra v Ghidorah, Rodan - Revelation 2021 - Kong v Godzilla v Mecha Godzilla - Change  2023 - Kong v Sea monster - History  2023 - Godzilla v Ion Dragon - Dream  2024 - King Kong, Godzilla v Lady Scar, Shimo - Rise
The ultimate showdown of the Titans is going to be pure cinematic excitement! Can't wait to see Kong and Godzilla go head-to-head!
So scylla and mothra return, this will be epic
The scene where scar king yeeted the piece of that building. W🎉
Better than madame web
Kong Fans Attendence Here ⬇️⬇️⬇️
Giving King Kong a powerfist is the best advertisement for the new Fallout show that Bethesda and Amazon will ever pull off.
Dude that new Godzilla roar sounds like someone made PenguinZ0 woooo louder
Why is Kong mewing tho😭✋
bro who made this trailer 😢❤
It's painful to see these images after the beautiful Godzilla Minus One 😢
Can't belive mothra back and she looks even pritier than before
Boring
Kong got the hulk buster
❤
OMG i gotta see this JAWN they call my boy KING for a reason😆👍🏾💯
🟣🦖❤🦍❤🦋🆚🦧❤❄️🐊
the ice creature roar sounds so bad like it comes from a indi game
Early access game with reused assets.  yes
I been waiting bro
Monkey big
Looks good but I think it shows to much in the trailer
I wanted to see more Shimo
Where did Kong get the gauntlet...maybe from a  JAEGER 😮 Calling it now, stinger will be the Pacific Rim Jaegers!
Another stupid movie
Supposedly Mothra is making a comeback so this should be interesting
The movie is an epic monster show down. I wish they didn't spoil everything in the trailer😑
This trailer it very Amazing 👏
OMG! 🦖👊🦍 Just watched the new trailer for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire and I'm shook! The visuals, the epic showdowns – it's like a dream come true for every monster movie fan! This isn't just a battle, it's a cinematic spectacle of colossal proportions! Can't wait to see these legendary titans go head-to-head in the ultimate clash of monsters. 🎬🔥
I cannot wait for godzilla to smack up that dumb ahhh orangutan
Yessir can’t wait also Godzilla new look is kinda good not as good as blue tho but still good 💯
I have seen the leak footage of Shimo 😮 like wtf she's damn tall
2:34 didn’t realize Godzilla could still use that mothra bomb he used in kotm
If they dare try to retcon the obvious win of Godzilla folding up King Kong to make the other half of the monster verse happy.  I'm gonna loose it lol
These wolves from Pooyan nes still don't give a break!
😅😅😅😅😅 pp aww
It looks so stupid but so fun.
Kong got the storm breaker last episode and now suit up with the iron man armor arm.. what else does he need next time? Captain America's shield?
😮😮😮 can't wait ❤
So epic
2:48 just enna see this one shot on big screen 💀
IDEMOOO
Why do they keep making these 🤣
I am super fan of warnors bro...Your story was awesome all time ...And director Wal blockbuster all time...
My favourite actor gorilla 😂😂😂
Would be really cool to get a whole Godzilla X Kong roller coaster ride
bro got a glove😭😭😭
Oooh can’t wait!!
paper boi in dis
Marvel ❌ DC ❌ Monsterverse ✔️
Vfx>>>>
This is why minus one is better 🤷🏽‍♂️
Hello excuse me the  we are waiting for Telugu language version trailer since how many days we should wait....
Whare is the Telugu version
Godzilla is pink because he just watched the Barbie movie in the kaiju theatre
My horses is back
One' Of The Best Trailer & Super Bgm 😘🔥🔥❤️❤️😘😘😘
Paper bois career really took off
POV you land and get the mythic weapons 💀
finally EREN joined them
Yall milking this too much
Make sure not to make the humans terrible and empty in the story.
Godzilla just turned girly with that pink power
no way kong got an infinity gauntlet
I kind of liked the first few movies, but after watching Godzilla Minus 1 I'm much less interested in the western version of Godzilla.
This is not my 100th time watching this
Kong memang super kuat tdk mampu di kalah kan
Godzilla have family or not
The monstervers just keeps on getting better and better from the first Godzilla 2014 to now has been some the best films out there what a decade it's been hope it for ever continues
i sense diversity quotas not  for me
Who's idea was it to make godzilla run like a dude with a backpack on 😂
To think where this started 😂
I cant wait for this one!!!!!
I cant wait for this one!!!!!
Why godzilla is running , running is not his type
Please stop this nonsense😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Hi can anyone actually tell me why there exited to see this hot flaming pile of 💩 I’m actually kinda concerned I actually think the world is full of halftards
Godzilla's head is very small compared to its body .Which is very inapropriate .
Cool ! I made a cool trailer
Godzilla 1's cgı is still better this and most realistic ever
Warzone predicted it
Deying with excitement 😅
Waiting
💥King Ghidorah is the best Monster verse villian
а Вы тоже исчете комментарий на русском языке?
King Kong vs dongking kong
Where's the 1 sec scene where Shimo and Godzilla fighting.
Still won’t be better than minus one
😵
❤
Yayy! Excited for bigass lizard and largeass monke to team up!!
Jesus Loves You
wtf
🎉🎉🎉
Shimo is coming to destroy Godzilla and kong oh no
🤦‍♂
You guys can tell some of the ug or whatever it’s called is not fully done cause when it showed blue Godzilla our normal one he didn’t loook real so there’s still more to be done
Lord Jesus, I'm happy to witness this. Thank you. ❤🙏❤
Avengers vs Barbie
If this is another king movie like the last one (smh)
Rumors of a zero gravity battle , maybe we’ll see Godzilla’s iconic flying double kick 😂
What i got from this trailer! Kong meet's transformers, Godzilla goes super saiyan while in planet of the apes! 😅😂
Oh my Godddddddd🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
There is only one thing left to watch the death of red monkey or whatever he is they showed everything in this trailer... 🤦‍♂️
does anyone else hear moistcritikals "WOOOO" but pitched down slightly and distorted at 1:26?
Se tá doidoooooo
1:54 who is that?? Pretty confused
Who is excited for Godzilla vs Shimu ✨🔥and Scar king vs Kong .
omg❤
omg❤
The more ridiculous the better, we need a kong x Godzilla movie fighting space aliens on the moon.
Why does Godzilla sound like MoistCr1TiKaL's "let's go baby whooo" at 2:33?
Someone give kong barber a raise
I wonder if Dan Stevens had to beat off a lot of men for this role 👀
Gokuzilla+Thanos Monkey vs Furious George and Ice Pack
CGI overload...but I'm in!!!
Excited 🗿💀
뭔가 엄청나군 !
2:34 sound like men 😂😂
2:04
Kongs gauntlet: Toy Making $$$
I only know about this becuse of blade ball
one common thing other than  Godzilla in every Godzilla movie is the Helicopters... Helicopter scene can't be eliminated
Just stop the video 2:13 and zoom in find scar king and shimu Godzilla 😂 it's awesome
2:34 godzilla said woo
2:25 details are awesome 😂.
Give us cyote vs acme
2:52 when bro wants to practice his screaming with you at the dessert
Kong 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please don't spoil it
I’m totally watching this movie
GAD VS KONG
YES!! GODZILLA AND KONG WORKING TOGETHER!!
I don't need to see any more trailers. I'm stoked and hyped and ready like a kid again!!!!!
Amazing
Shimo ❌   Plot armor✅😮‍💨🔥
Not a single scene in this movie is going to top any part of Godzilla minus one. Stop making slop. Make actually good movies.
Let me be apart of the warner bros i really want to be an actor give me an opportunity please❤🙏goal to be a movie actor🥰
vulval.
行けたら行く
Lost interest in this this looks too much like a cartoon the last movie was terrible too
I Love how Warner Brothers and Legendary became the spiritual successor of the Showa and late-Heisei Eras while Toho continues to be faithful to Gojira's representation of atomic horror.
Who are they against to... I mean Kong & Godzilla are teaming up to defeat whome??
Godzilla be like: yee dhai kilo ka hath h
1:54 you can also see shimo evil smile if you brighten your phone/desktop/tab
❤❤
DANG! I HAVE GOT TO WATCH THIS!
💛🔥
So the blue godzilla is shimo who fires ice on kong in the trailer. Pink godzilla teams up with kong I guess.
goku black has a new match
1:16
Cartoon
PUBG x GODZILLA was something else 💔
The anamaniacs need to come out of the water tower and stone WB for this one maybe sacrifice the CEO to the monkey gods if necessary
That looks supercooooool.... 👏
🔥🔥
I saw shimu
2:27  😂
Telugu noo
Trailer 🔥  Full movie 💩
i want a godzilla movie without funny humans
No one like the monsterverse it fan base are toxic and the every singgel monsterverse movie is bad
That's gonna be kool movie.I must watch this.  ( I am 35.)
Gyat
This Epic
"Kong-vengers assemble!"
Can’t wait 😍🔥🔥
Anjayy anak kecil nya dah gede
Cool
I don't even know wtf is happening with this movie now... Or where it's heading.
Kong and god zilla🤞❤
GIVE ME THE MOVIE
Now that's called the beast,🔥🔥
I find this disappointing. Initially, I held some optimism, but having now seen it, I'm disheartened by the premise, writing style, and CGI graphics. It feels derivative and lacks originality.
Yeah mmm I think I'll pass on this one 😂 I'll just rewatch Minus One.
Damn I haven’t been excited about a  movie in a long time but this is 🔥
Love how the cast changes every single time. Is it supposed to be a super long time between movies? Or
CAN SEE THIS IN THE GHETTO EVERYDAY..
Новая дебилизация))
March 29 awaited
......
Meh
Totally goosebumps the sound of infinity gauntlet fit in kong hand🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:07 Rocky and Apollo run ftw
Kab aayega yarr YouTube pe bahut jyada acited ho raha hu 😢
THE HYPE IS REAL OMG
Is it just me or is there implications that there are 2 Godzilla’s
No way I’m paying theater ticket prices to see this. But I’ll still see this 😂😅
This movie shows Japan vs America this the final battle it’s coming guys
Shimo: **breaks Kong’s axe**  Kong: “DANG IT! That was limited edition!”
Kya chutiyapa hai ...
Wow power fist
IronKong
This could have been a great movie IF they just didn't use Kong and Godzilla.   This is not their story.
I love these movies because the Japanese ones are about the corruption of the government and how scary Godzilla is and these ones are just bros being dudes and monkey go RAAAAH and i'm all here for all of it.
#reeload media
@reeload media
Jus5tst watched the whole move  through this trailer  WTF?
OMG SIMO 😮
I was hoping for Donkey Kong as the new rival monkey 🙈
Why tf do those screaming sounds sound like Charlie goin “WOOOOO, YEAH BABY”💀
Go Gorilla 🦍
We want tamil trailer 😡😤👊👊
If they decide to make another movie. The villain should be either Orga or Destroya
So your telling me that kong gets the infinitey gauntlet and Godzilla goes super saiten rose?
Big CGI CGI fight coming up
Godzilla getting two types of thermo form now its  1.Thermo Lava 2.Thermo Storm
Made me tear up a bit
oh my god ive been waiting so long
0:30
Every scene they show of Godzilla in this trailer he looks pissed off  And im all for it
godzilla unlocked super sayian blue and rose
Yooo Godzilla and Kong vs The Planet of the Apes looks litt!!! lol /s
2:28 I agree with that guy. Really feels like all these movies are the same, trying to out-do each other. That goes for a lot in Hollywood now. I almost predicted the opening line “for thousands of years, there was peace; then came the war…” “cities blowing up” “sinkhole in the Earth’s surface” blah blah blah.
Why another "Godzilla" vs Kong...just leave it to toho.  Either way we need more mothra. I did enjoy the homage to the monsters.
0:48 bro is doing the one piece turn
kong vs Zeke
ये गॉडजिला और कोंग पब्जी मोबाइल में 2 साल पहले आ गया है 😝
Epic
waiting for this from  Bangladesh ❤
when you try to MCUs a movie this is what happen, it lost soul, it might be entertaining but you will forget it..., this is why Minus One getting all the praise ... it has soul ...
Anybody else getting flashbacks to the 90's arcade game _Primal Rage_ with these trailers? I hope I'm not alone.
I Won’t To Watch The Movie
jajajajaja hay que verla con aditivos 🤣🤣
I like Godzilla More Haha
It’s Caesar Kong! Lol
i only wish it wasnt monkeys lol, bring in Gamera or  Destroyah or Biolante or SPACE GODZILLA! lol, but it looks awesome non the less!!!
eh i'll just torrent it when it goes out on dvd or streaming.
الهرم ياولود البرة 🤨
“Something is coming. Something even they’re afraid of.”  Godzilla and Kong: *”Girl! Have you seen the guys we’ve beaten? We ain’t scared of off-brand Killer Frost and Gorilla Grodd!”*
Why is bro pink
New MonsterVerse fans: “BRO SHIMO IS IN THIS MOVIE!!!”  OG MonsterVerse fans: “Who the heck is Shimo?”
Bias sial movie ni kat beruk.
❤😊
It always starts with the discovery of some signal.  When will they learn to just mind their business?  Rather than an augmented Kong, someone could've given us a proper Pacific Rim 2. Still pissed-off about that farce.
This is the year of Godzilla.  Toho Godzilla minus zero, and now this movie.
wtf hahaha
filme 3:00:00 desenhos anime liga da justiça de james gunn batman  superman  mulher-maravilha  the flash  lanterna verde john stewart mulher-gavião  caçador de marte  black canary  dc vixen  shazam  aquaman  supergirl  lanterna verde jessica cruz  dc senhor incrível  dc questão
Where. The. F. Is. Mothra??
The CGI looks the worst between all the Monsterverse! I don't know who nor how, but somebody *managed* to make Rebecca Hall look so ugly and bad, completely out of taste
Hey everyone, we really hoped you liked the music in this video! We are the guys behind this track! We are 'The Wellermen' & the track is called 'Hoist The Colours'
Yooooooooo this is fyeeeeeeeee 😭😭
the should change to godzilla & kong
Also, Icezilla.
I am so gassed for this movie 😤
Why is it that in every single hollywood trailer they use the exact same suspense music?
I just have to say: this is Insane my friends. This looks Tremendous. Thanks.
I love how Shimo and Skar King are like evil variants of Godzilla and Kong. They are confronting themselves...
Baby Godzilla
It would have been better if there was like an alien invasion Goliath monsters battling against Kong and Godzilla just like something straight out of a game called King of the Monsters 2. Now that would have been awesome and would love to go to the movie theaters to see that.
Yes! Another milking video
If anything happens to Kong I’m going to loose it!!!!!!
warner bros why is godzilla destroying the peoples every time godzilla is my favourite and he should be better than  king kong 😢
Woooooooooow !!!! 🤩😍
i think they went a little to far with the imagination
This is just silly, and I'm all for it
wait , so now kong is a fu*king transformer ?!
İnsanlar artık yeni şeyler üretmek yerine eski güzel şeyleri bozuyorlar
FYI moronic people saying let the Japanese etc etc make these movies. Maybe you morons should actually look at the studios included and the ones in charge, ( Japan ) has multiple and two in charge alongside Wb.   But hey you’d need a brain to see that in their title / credits or well to even pay attention
I think 1:58 ....the monarch monster which makes people icy ....
It's Queen Kong
when you think about it im literally skar king
Now imagine they are not using their imaginations anymore but that there is truthfully an actual hollow earth 🤌🏻🤌🏻
Loving the monsterverse apart from their obsession to make monsters unable to win or save the world without human help. Hope this one skip this for good.
Why he pink?
q chingon
Reptilian x Man
where is the iconic godzilla roar?
apes are so fugly. also cant stand these straight storylines they wanna shove down our throats
ganz schön affig das Ganze
This is Mad guys❤
A stupid movie for stupid people
The Craziest Thing Kong did was Knock a teeth out of scar king
Americans should really let Japaneses people do Japanese stuff...
Looks better than minus 1 mainly because minus 2 brought out all the toxic realism obsessed fake fans
Shimo is COMING❄
Please make a Batman beyond movie
damn, this is cinema these days.
Did you guys realize something like a scream of a Youtuber
It's very silly, I can't watch so much nonsense
better than MCU
KONG MANOPL THE INFINITY!!!
Im so hyped
King Kong x transformers
Thanks for the trailer, at least I know what I won't be watching. Even nonsense has its limits.
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, then this. What a year!
same old boring script
My thoughts while watching this: Godzilla's new form looks very interesting. I wonder if it's more powerful than burning Godzilla. I wonder...my boy Ghidorah is the 2nd strongest monster monster my other boy Godzilla has fought. The 1st is that other 1. The name escapes me but he's 1 of the ones who actually looks like a monster. I think he has wings and a crazy looking face. Is it him? Is he the big bad who's got kong and even Godzilla worried? Then as I got to the end I saw that it looked like another damn monkey... curious. My boddy is ready lizard daddy!
Godzilla  hold my nuclear breath
ı am kıng kong
😲😲😲🫢🫢🫢❤️💯💯💯👍🏽👍🏽
this is sick
How Godzilla ran than fast? It looks comically amusing!
Earlier kong got the stormbreaker and now the gauntlet. Fck yeah. WB is roating marvel for sure😂
at first i thought it was just kong and godzi fighting a 2 v 1 again but damn its 2v2 cant wait for this berserk to be on theatre
“Kong can’t handle this on his own!” 😂 could he ever? 😂😂😂
2021 Godzilla VS Kong 2019 Godzilla King Of the monsters Kong skull island 2024 GODZILLA X KONG( 1:14 rip bro….)
Why im leasing a moist critical scream?
This movie about to be a banger! I aldready know it.Great job on the trailer
Thanks for including the entire film in the trailer, saved me some money <3
Hope Tamil dubbed is there in theatre. A huge fan of kong & Godzilla
This movies got goofy
Madre mia, esto es Cine!
Presented horizontally:)
A storm of apes is coming  🦍💥
monkey has infinity gauntlet!!! monkey has infinity gauntlet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D
So King Kong is a transhumanist now and probably gets Neural Link. I hope he doesn't start speaking as well.
Kong king 👑😎👿
What is the big deal about Shimo
Cool trailer, but please, stop uploading 2.39:1 as 16:9 with black bars! It looks stupid on a 21:9 monitor.
Bgm 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is what I call a Movie Trailer.
❤❤❤❤
there is a hint of shimo in the trailer
who is the enemy. dont understand..
Thanks for 9 subscribers😢  No one supports 😒  You can subscribe by doing this (Jai Shree Ram 🙏🚩) 🙏
Very good film  ı like godzilla
What is even the role of humans in these movies apart from delivering cheeky lines
Elite Cameraman Studios
Damn each movie is better then the previous one Ghidora Mecha godzila Now scar and shemo..  Finally a movie satisfying after marvel decade.
So awesome and so awful, just like the previous ones.
Kong in his autobot era
I love pokemons
Shimu its very cool ❄️❤ 1:46
Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be epic.
This and dead pool 3 are the reasons I’m going back to movie theaters
I like it.
Yoooo they coming out with a part 2 fr????
Kong wasn't enough. They had to give him a bionic arm and Godzilla super saiyan god super saiyan, and I'm in
Theres a chance shimu froze godzilla too as we know he came out of antartica
The last time those two met up, it was almost the end of kong 2:18 🔥🔥🔥
Wow OMG!!!
why dose Kong have a robot hand and why is Godzilla pink??????? I need to know and don't think I did't see that baby throw a rock at bloody Kong and is he ok?
Somebody on twitter a while back said Godzilla is just Goku and that statement has been proven true yet again..
Honestly, this movie looks stupid.
So that's why you gotta spit the gum after chewing for a while. After a point, there's no flavor left....
чушь
Godzila and Kong's new mission
Where is the Kong Buster suit ?
Rise of the planet of the King Kong 😅
LET THIS REACH 30M VIEWS BEFORE MARCH! COMMON WE GOT THIS!
boo
Oh dear 😴
Shimu appreance😱🔥
I feel like i watched the entire movie.
This movie looks awesome, but there are 2 things that I should point out:  1. March 29th is literally the day after my birthday.  2. From this trailer’s description, it looks like the humans and monsters are both going down into the Hollow Earth.
Afraid? When did she ask them both if they were afraid?
Godzilla become pgbtq member
Where is mille bobby brown 🤌😑
0:30 MOTRHA!
essa franquia se tornou uma piada
maaaan godzilla kinda went downhill hard, message is basically meaningless now that it's just some consumerist blockbuster action movie. Womp womp.
Godzilla and Kong: The ultimate clash of titans or just a monster-sized misunderstanding? Either way, I'm all in for the popcorn and the epic showdown!
Scar king better brush his teeth
Scar king is very ugly
Another different film! 0:01
So there are two godzillas  in this movie ,now thats a twist to attract.......
New Titan is coming shimu
I am super ey
Batman v Superman hold this beer
so we getting godzilla x kong tag team before gta 6
Finally Shimo is back
AS INDIAN I NEVER WATCH BOLLYWOOD MOVIES..FULL PHYSIC ..😂THIS IS WHERE I BELONG: HOLLYWOOD ❤
“I’m scared something is wrong with me” Yeah you cant TALK bruh
I am so excited
0:25
Godzilla and Kong tag is gonna be sick! Image a tag team attack?
Might as well Make Kaiju Avengers at this point, and make a crossover with Transformers or maybe Sonic the hedgehog.
Planet of the Kongs vs Godzilla: Pacific Rim
He is not alone!!
Damnnn bruhhh
Can anyone explain me why godzilla's breath is ice 🤔
SORA in 2025 !
To see them both run like human is funny to me😂
At this rate I have got 50-60 Godzilla x Kong movies in my lifetime
At this rate I have got 50-60 Godzilla x Kong movies in my lifetime

Black Goku And Thanos Teams To Beat A Orangutan And A Lizard That Can Spit Ice Beams
Who wants Godzilla x Marvel😂
Godzilla vs Kong is better than Avengers endgame😂🔥
Kong is the new Thanos lol
Thanks now I don't have to watch it
The scar king 👑 looks like a titan 2:48
I can't wait. Super excited
Please release in Marathi too
🤣
shimu y scar VS godzilla y kong !
Kong got the gauntlet because I think correctly at 1:45 if we watch in 0.25 x speed we can see that scar king whip has a blade at the end which cut Kong's hand
Godzilla, kong, and Transformers.. 🥺
0:36 One more I don’t care about the humans nor what stupid messages they got, and just want king and Godzilla to fight monster’s.
Anyone remembers when trailers were not half the movie?
Cut the hair of the pretty girl...  Gee thanks
Ye baat is movie ke saath biryaani tu bnti hy....🎉
Godzilla is goku with super saiyan blue fighting shimo with super sayian blue
nossa que bomba vai ser esse filme
kong went full thanos . i cant wait to see this .....
Yall underestimatin shimu power he like a evil godzilla with a ice beam but bigger he the one trapped ghidoriah in ice when they freed him
Kong fans assemble🔥
Ansioso por essa batalha!!!
Cuz family
Godzilla running scene had me cry laughing XD
0:29 bro I can’t wait
This looks ridiculously stupid
I USUALLY DONT GO TO THE MOVIE BUT GODZILLA AND KONG MOVIE, OH MAN 100% GOING TO THE MOVIES FOR THIS ONE
IT'S ON LIKE TITAN WARRIORS
2:31 the way that I thought he said WHOOO while exploding (atomic pulse) lol
KONG İS IRONMAN HAHHAA🤣
ULTRAMAN be like, it's okay it's not Japan, let them have fun there..
What the fck am I watching?
Too much bs should keep it simpler fantasy here is tooo much
waiting for them to make love
wowzers
Kong and Godzilla are gonna fight a Mega Orang Utan?
Maybe Next episode kong V Optimus primal......🤔
I cannot wait to watch this with a dicounted ticket in an empty screening
Should have put Godzilla on all 4’s on that run seen
Crazy😮😮
Ga sabar tayang di netflix
the crunch sound when kong socked scar king in the face 💀
looks like godzilla and kong are about to have a rematch
It's coming in March 29
CGI quality is on a downward spiral, this looks worse than 2007 Transformers - a movie that is 16 years old. If this kind of movie is not a special effects bonanza then what is really the point.
This just looks goofy. None of the flair of the predecessors
Kong❤❤❤
HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE
Kong fighting dinosaurs and now with a gauntlet....it was a long journey
I feel like I've already seen 80% of the movie...   I guess the next instalment will be with Godzilla and Kong gathering the rest of the titans, make a justice league titans team, move on an orbital spaceship monitoring humanity while they are fighting Cthulhu and his eldritch horror brothers.   I will enjoy this movie anyways boom, boom, fight, fight, dino, monkey, give me more.
godzilla be like "ayo you messin with my lil bro at lunch today?"
I haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time. Looks amazing. Can't wait!! 🔥
Zor
Imagine kong with a kong size captain America shield... 🤯  "Engage all defences... And get this monkey a shield"
Kong got thano's infinity gauntlet but much bigger and godzila evolved into a new powerful form if they work together they will be unstopable against shimo and the delusional scar false king of hollow earth maybe he is going to a mental hospital there are many delusional titans there maybe he will be a crazy titan seeking for revenge imagen if scar king was sent to a mental hospital that will be funny and suprising, maybe someday godzilla and kong visit the delusional scar false king, and maybe mecha ghidorah will visit him and scar king will be humiliated when he sees him rule the world😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kong is slowly turning into old Kratos
One of the most powerful duo
I love modern trailers, they show so much, saves me time and money to see the whole movie. Nice recap of sh*t I'm not going to see
Why does there monkeys have an infinity gauntlet?
Nobody throws a harder punch than kong  Nobody is more badass than godzilla coming from nowhere with a new form
SICK!🔥🔥
After this magnificent movie breaks box office records do a prequel.  Including King Ghldorah , Shimo, Mothra, Rodan.  The  Godzillas / Dragon with baby godzilla and the Kongs with baby kong and show how they were worshipped and Earth was invaded and damn near destroyed. How Scar King rose to power and took control of Shimo. The run time would be long but it could be  2 parts to it . This way King Ghidorah could still be used in the monster versus. We get a better understanding of shimo.  Why Godzilla is so ferocious and the back story with Godzilla and Mothra.  The mutos and skull crawlers.   I think that would be awesome but one thing at a time!  I'm so hyped for Godzilla X Kong!   You guys have so much back story the prequel writes itself!   Throwing this out in the universe and seeing were it falls! 😅❤
🔥🔥🔥
1:50 💀🔥
When they released trailer but actually it's film summary 😂
Lmao. What is this s***?
Skarking was inspired on Kratos and Koba ( i guess so).
19aprl
Are the orangutans mind controlling godzilla or do they have their own godzilla
the part where Godzilla and Kong is running together gave me chills
What do you mean it's not the new Michael Bayformers moview we were promised? 😂
Godzilla + Kong + Planet of the Apes giant version... awesome!!
02:33 - Cr1TiKaL when he sees what he's been waiting for, and what it's all about.
Wow it's Cool 😎
So I know how Godzilla gets under the ice so since he will not be fighting Shimo until almost the end of the movie when Godzilla is afraid of the new threat he disappears and go under the ice to absorb radiation and evolve to a stronger and tougher fighter
Godzilla will fire this time 💞💞💞
Omg mothra is back... 0:29  I'm so excited with this movie she's a Queen 👑
Waste. 😢
Is this a new movie of godzilla vs king kong or the old one
Iron Kong gonna be lit
Indonesian people cant wait too long brother
Next movie : Godzilla / Kong
ANSIOSOOOOOO
Pubg Mobile me Phir se Lao Ye Mode😢❤
What's happening nowadays VFX? It's looking like a game. 😢 😢
SOME OF VFX&CGI SHOTS ARE STILL LOOKS BAD, THAT SWIMMING SCENE OF BLUE GODZILLA & SPECIALLY evolved GODZILLA all scenes 0:15_0:53_2:05_2:52
Movie link plz,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the worst trailers I've ever seen
Hollow earth is a big place we briefly got a glimpse of it . As soon as they made it they only went to one place.  In the first trailer of this movie you actually see kong sliding down to a deeper level of the hollow earth  They actually have to explore it to find other forms of life which they didnt do in godzilla vs kong
looks rubbish and a waste of time
HAHAAHAHAHAHAAH
What’s a bad word
2.37
متى يصبح لدينا هوليوود حقيقية تنتج للعرب افلام مثل هذه ؟
Fhhgg
Like Marvel they also create comedy now
kong with a infinity gaunlet. epic
GOD’S HELLO❤️🕋🤲☝️
Wait a minute.Does Kong have the infinity guantlent?
.
.
Looking at Big Kong, I think of the anime movie Dragon Ball when Songoku achieved the power of Super Saiyan.☺️🎁☺️🎁😱💘😍
☺☺☺Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be epic.👏👏👏👏👏
Can't wait to watch this movie ❤ KONG (Protector of humanity) & GodZilla(Protector of nature)  team up again💪
Kung fu panda 4, planet of the apes and now this is coming. Got some nice movies to look forward to
Destroyed my SONY earbud..  what is this..😳😳😳😳  the sound effect..🔥🔥🔥🔥

Veruthanam 🔥

A pure adrenaline rush
This is so dumb... I'm actually going to watch this!
l Am YouTuber 🔥🔥 🤩👉Mera tech Channel Hai👈🤩 🤠👉Mere Channel Se Alpha Help        Ho Sakata Hai👈🤠
goofy ahh movie
Why does Godzilla's roar sound like Moist Cr1TiKaL's scream at 2:33?
🔥🔥When is the movie coming out?
1:26 I can't believe they hired Penguinz0 to voice in this movie, I thought he'd be too expensive after Hunger Games
1:51 many memes will be made from that face guarantee it
Ah big monster movie. Never cant be wihout little deaf girl xd
so kong and godzilla are jus teaming up and fighting another big moneky
Power rangers?😂
0:55 might be Shimo My thoughts, idk abt other people

This movie will be amazing mannn

whoa so super cool and uber fantastic :D, not gonna watch it :/
Shut up and take my money! 🤩
at this moment, it's not kaiju verse anymore, looks like a marvel movie for me. They destroyed the vibe of the titans and killed the "uniqueness" of them
Mini kong❤❤
Where is peta WB always violating Kong and godzilla...😅
bruh Godzilla is turning into a marvel franchise
Showing too much in these trailers 🙃
Hopeless movie with no real sense. Ill watch it by downloading the pirated version.
I’m going to still go see it cause I’m a fan, but idk, franchises like fast and furious and this need to do a reboot… Godzilla vs kong was ok, but tbh they need to start showing the aftermath of the last sequels..I feel like yes we could use this plot but the last movie where the f were the rest of the apes when Kong went down there the last time
Yall tripping if u think this trailer is actually good
what kind of stupidity is this , made in murica 100%
Looks boring and cliché
2:27 slow this and you will see titanus shimo
They are fighting again?!
kong did my boy skar king dirty with that haymaker punch 💀
Need this to for get the kk game
so big
I think at Hollow earth fight shimu broke kong axe
We can't wait for this fire movie
I hope the mute  girl will get her voice this time
nope
The New Empire of planet of aps with pink Godzilla and tiny humans....
❤❤❤
I love godzilla, those who love godzilla should like it
I feel I hungry I want to eat Godzilla and Kong Doppppppp.
1:14 i hear charlie scream
❤❤
0:30 omg pause and then youll see mothra in the eye reflection make sure its 0.25 speed
goofy ahh movie
Why can't Kong just snap his fingers with that gauntlet?
kong became doomfist lmao💀💀
Its so outrageous and u know its gonna be hot trash but u still watch it anyways because its entertaining
My eyes were searching for Apex🫣😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️🤫🤫🤫
Looks like a solid "Meh..."  Honestly speaking though, I much preferred when the Titan moved like they had actual mass that needed to mostly obey the laws of physics. Now they're running and jumping around like they're mostly filled with Helium, which seriously breaks my immersion when watching these movies.
Bro is kong bigger than how he was in zilla x Kong🤔🤔🤔 bro been bench pressing mountains
Godzilla running killed it for me 😂😂💀🏃🏻‍♂️🦖
Nutun Godzilla Valo laglona
LOVE THE DIDDY KONG
First movie fights did not disappoint. I hope this one doesn’t either
2:05…..i dont care how silly it may look but kong and godzilla running towards something IS FREAKING AWESOME
Pls make trailer 3 about godzilla
That's a much better trailer edit than the first. And, thank goodness for that. I'm hoping we get to see some of Mothra’s stone-cold, bad-assery as a surprise, mid-film treat 💕👌
Sadly, this is almost venturing into Sharknado territory.... Uhg...
Is this video game?
Calling it now Godzilla uses his flying drop kick
Many wars start over a woman; I wonder what babe will these two will be fighting for?
😱
Hopefully footage of kaijus fighitng will be for more than 6 seconds at a time.
YES!! GODZILLA AND KONG WORKING TOGETHER!!
So basically, superman vs batman part 2, got it!
Legacy always makes the best trailers
worst Trailer
1:13 soy yo o se escucha el Charlie woooo meme?
Kong got the hulk buster arm
MONKE
Bro literally goosebumps 😶😶😶
Wow
goosebumps aa gye
It's good to know that Kong's species did not go extinct. Even if they are controlled by an evil Monkey.
Doesn't look good.
2:53 this part is🔥
100+ years of Hollywood movies, and still, when they want a scared, whimpering coward, they plug in the token black guy. How pathetic and degrading to black community😒
This is stupid and I'm loving it
MOTHRA?!
When a 12 year old uses chat gpt to write a script
Godzilla no.1 dope titan in the monsterverse
ChatGTP Sora stuff. boring
missing milly bobby brown
Kinda wish they hadnt kept that stupid gravity portal thing. It was already revealed as a plothole in the last film since they didnt need one to get back.
looks like ice godzilla is a villain
Please Please Please let there be a post credit Toho reference with a new Godzilla themed movie. Pleeeeeease. Also more Kong solo
OMG NOW this is getting waaaay beyond stupid, cheesy and ridiculous! Really???
Peak Monsterverse already passed bruh, the last movie was mid, this looks like its appeal to an ADHD brain, that’s why I liked Godzilla Minus One better.
This move become more ridecoulous but i like it 😂
Tf is this movie about?
Ok
The views are growing up fast🔥
0:31  is our first look at shimo
Nonsense movie
Pyramid is not your dads property stop breaking it in every films you mortal idiots
Dang immagine kong being godzilla passenger princess
ゴジラコングでまた大ボス戦って欲しい、大ボス怪獣参戦に期待
Why do those roars sound like that one moist critical meme
21 million brainless idiots impressed with fake cgi
Chao Times When Are llegamos bien igual Cuiche descargar ya quedó el 0% así es que habla si no te llevas bien😊
The scene of kong and zilla charging never fails to build hype
I cant wait to watch the compilations of only the monster fights, cutting out all the human parts. God forbid they give us something entertaining.
I think that iron fist is the job of the great and one and only TONY STARK soon kong gonna find rest of the armor and fly high in the sky like a mountain in pandora 😅
How strong will Kong be when he has Thanos' infinite gauntlet?
i didnt figure out, who's the villain?
The king of monsters 🔥 And god of monster 🔥
Every Kong sequel becomes even more dumb.
Do they feed on landmarks?
Funny :)
And milibobbbbybroun?
Looks fun in a stupid way. I'll probably watch it while high and see if it's good
Lol comes out on my bday
Trash
Trash 🗑️🗑️
Literally Got chills First Kong uses storm breaker 🪓⚡️and Know Kong uses a Gauntlet 🥊  Are they making some Marvel References

Whens mothra gonna be relevant again.
They ruined both franchises, its getting pathetic with each sequel. Japs showed how a fokin Godzilla movie should be made
Yooo after 3 years it’s finally back
Kong x Godzilla both together fight another Kong?
Is it only me that realize on 00 : 30 Kong vs Scar and Godzilla vs Another Godzilla with ice power ?
planet of kongs? transformzillas?
Doesn't look as good as the previous film, but will probably still be fun.
Monsterverse Future!!
OH!!!! SÓ GOOD!!!😊
The Most civil Civilization!!!
🤦‍♂️
Like Goku and Vegeta 😂
хуитакакаято
So, these movies just keep getting dumber and dumber it seems.
Dude Kong punch skar king so hard that his tooth came out  😳 2:25
So they’re not friends they still hate each other slightly
Giv kong some kamehamehah!!  Make is supersaiyan mode

Question is who is the true king .?👀👀
godzilla rosa??!! davvero??
This movie feels like it's trying to be too many things at once .. godzilla on steroids and planet of the apes ..?
new magneta form looks ahh
Infinity gauntlet and super saiyan powers. Bring it on.
I'm so happy Monsterverse didn't shut down, especially after bad reviews for Skull Island and King of the Monsters, and still produces movies.
I have a feeling half those other kongs will side will Kong and rebel against Skar
What if shimo and King Ghidorah had a fight and shimo froze King Ghidorah.
Free Palestine✌🇵🇸
Very poor animation. I'm thinking, Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull level, maybe. The Red ape has an exceptionally poor design. Also, I'm not a fan of how much they've humanized either of my two favourite creatures/monsters.
This looks awful
Well now i know the whole movie. It was fun when only the first trailer came out and wed debate wtf was going on
These are the movies that deserves everything! Every type of emotion thrilled in a psuedo fanta realistic world❤
Rebecca hall is selling herself short by being in nonsense like this
Can’t wait for another two hours of useless dialogue and 20 minutes of fighting
20k dislikes are crazy
Ok... why is Godzilla's roar so messed up in this trailer?
I just wish these Kaiju movies had 5% humans nad 95% kaijus
2:50 Brooo did Kong loses one of his tusk too? 😢 it looks like a It looks like they're going to put in a steel implant.
This is going to be nonsense.
They should do KONG x Godzilla X Pacific rim
Yay, on the day of my birthday
WOW!!!! I cant wait been watching these films since 70s ALL OF THEM👍
what a waste of money
They really brought monster movies back. My Uncle Tom would love this, RIP
This is the Combo we've been waiting for 😊😊
So sick of the human story arch’s. Get rid of the damn deaf girl and just show more of the titans
I can't wait to see this!
2028 Mechagodzilla
2:23  scar got violated by a kid and by king kong 💀
Infinity gauntlet
WOW already at 20m views 😲
1:51 blud realized he’s not build for this
I dont want to build any expectations or false hope, but i would like to point it out that the gauntlet activation at 2:42 sound like the original 1962 king kong vs godzilla soundtrack.
I heard Scylla when Skar king threw the building! Will she be in the movie!?
they didn't show even a second of Godzilla and Shimu's fight... I'm so proud of them
So they just went completely bonkers now?
Now that i see it, this looks like it using sora ai 🤨 (Alright this is a joke, there's an ai called sora which can create really realistic videos of whatever prompt you type, this look great. And I doubt they used any ai in the production of this movie)
BIG MONSTER FIGHT EHUEHUEHU
nice
Ridiculous movies, pure BS.
You already know I’m gonna watch this movie four times
Bruh, just give Kong a gaint mini gun already
Why do they keeping firing at G-man?!
Cringe beyond belief
I love it
Official in egypt❤😍
PS5 game trailer
Niccce! I'm in!
GIANT LOBSTER FROM THE OLD DAYS?
Cthulhu rises
these cartoonish characters are not even close to previous parts. dont ruin a good franchise
seems like a part of planet of the apes x transformers , with godzilla giving surprise entry.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Hopefully Millie Brown's character isn't in this movie.
PS5?
Oh and mothra is gonna be back in this movie
I'm not gonna lie, seeing Godzilla and Kong charging together send huge chills down my spine
Team godzilla baby this is gonna be a really cool movie
Bad CGI  Cartoonish.
nice game......mean movie!
This looks TERRIBLE
I just wish in either the Legendary Monsterverse,  or definitely this new Toho Minus One era Anguirus,  Baragon, Varan,  even Manda would get reintroduced and be badass
Appeasing is the immersion in dreamtime.
Its the same mediocre trash, come out with something decent or dont bother
watched the whole best moments of the movie in a trailer...got the story line saw the end.. im happy...no need for a theater
Why are the human characters in the last few of their movies so lame and nonsensical? Its getting worse every movie
i swear i heard that scream and i thought it was moist critikal 😭😭
Deve essere una cagata assurda
i just figured there are 2 godzillas now. Pause at 0:31 and see in the right a pink and a white Godzilla  see for yourself. 2 Kongs and 2 Godzillassss Damnnn
Can't get over the fact my man Godzilla sounds like Cr1tikal at 2:30
my guy is doomfist
This sounds FLOP
wow!!! I loved that!!!
I SWEAR I SAW THE BEHEMOTH IN THE TRAILER AT 0:31
That Kong-looklike has to be dangeours to make Godzilla and Kong to team up
Very cool. Looking forward to the Post Credits scene. Space Godzilla or another MECH maybe?
This is a joke now lol
God this movie is going to be so much fun to watch
Era kong e kodizila ai mostra os 2 juntos depois contra 😂😂 entendi nada
Calling it rn Godzilla X Kong and Deadpool 3 will single handly carry 2024
This is the stupidest thing I have ever seen.  We are all now dumber for having watched it.
1:50 shimu
So we got super saiyan Rosé Godzilla and King Kong with a power fist. Cant say im not intrigued
Looks EPIC, but i'm still waiting for the Godzilla vs Destroyah movie
Why don’t we get a better look at Shimo
I can’t wait
Sorry I meant Kong chasing Godzilla?
Stupid these 2are together at all! Kong had to climb the Empire State Building while Godzilla can just walk through it! 2 totaly diffrent size animals! Another flop of a movie just like the last one!
Idk man its cool and all but the scale in these movies has completely gone out the window, monsters look big but they dont feel big like they did in the first 3
Just dont involve the females as much please
Soar king is very ugly
I am impressed. I haven't seen any of Godzilla movies to be honest and maybe 1 involving Kong but man. Thank God there are people who are like "lets just make a movie about monsters fighting each other and destroy the entire city". Something like Pacific Rim. This looks like a lot of CGI work for something pointless as a plot or story but they know it. They know people just want to watch random monsters fighting each other are they know we are going to love it.
Big fan of the recent Kong and Godzilla films, but this looks awful to me.
Yo warner bros. Can you make an logo of me?
Something I noticed is that, the short scene of kong and skar king fighting (kong with his axe, and skar king with hip whip) when skar king blocks kong with his whip, kong pushed skar king down with one arm, causing skar king to fall to his knees. 1:43
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHHHHHHH I. SCREAMING
Didn't know this trailer was a thing 😭
WoW....
So whos the bad guy
It's some heavy movie loading🍿🎥
Dammm why Godzilla BECAME pink😢😂
best vfx movie i have ever watched ❤❤😊
They should've kept the ominous atmosphere of the first godzilla that made the monsters feel more epic and scary. Now it's been marvelized and they both look like goofy toys
The planes of the Apes vs Gozzila/Kong?
Be ready for the biggest movie in 2024 !!!!
That looks like crazy mindless fun
Waiting for scar king action 🔥🔥
😂😂😂😂😂😂
So there are 2 godzillas now? Or am I tripping?
2:27
With every movie, it just gets worse and worse, lol.
Yo
Goosebumps😮😮😮 wat a trailer.... ❤
I can't wait 😱
There is some surprise like mega Godzilla in this movie
Kong with Thanos gauntlet and thor hammer ⚒️ 😂
Soooo the new titan is an orangutan?  That's a bit of a let down!
God damn this looks dumb. Get out of my feed.
It's almost too much, I remember the intence vibe of the very first godzilla
Too much "dub step" sound.  Tone that shheeeuuut down!
2:06 me and my friends chasing the ice cream truck
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🏆Totally phenomenal
Godzilla vs Kong quick rematch and then team together 😂
എൻ്റമ്മോ . .തീ ഐറ്റം ❤❤❤
This franchise is now getting dumber 🙃
What is this all lol i miss the old Godzilla and kong
these two are just not going to stop are they?? nor will the movies i guess
yesi❤
they tamed gozilla🥲🥲🥲🥲
I was getting goosebumps 💪🏻🙀
Shimu seen at 2.13 seconds
@Random Video Channel
I'm not gonna lie, seeing Godzilla and Kong charging together send huge chills down my spine
Epic 😮‍💨
this is amazing
I'm waiting Godzilla x Kong the new empire march 29
2:25
Visual candy but empty content
Thanks for showing the entire movie. Now I can pirate it instead.
Might as well upload the whole movie 😅
God+Zilla King+Kong
Kingzilla
So they're facing an army of titan apes and maybe an evil godzilla that can freeze things
Kong got the Doomfist gauntlet, and Godzilla is pink, I literally can’t wait for this movie
This gon be cheekz, I know it.
Kya kya bakwaas picture banate hain aaj kal
Godzilla know famous tourist spots
Godzilla/Kong 🤝 Goku/Vegeta
Looks fire!
Truly atomic
do we have a clear image of what shimo look like in the movie? i saw both trailers and so far no view of shimo yet.
I'm lovin' it
Godzilla has an AOE attack now.
SHIMUUUU
I love it 💕❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
lmfao
2:30  this is badass fr
This gonna bring a whole new level to monarch season 2
i love kong and his big shlong
My goodness.. What i just saw😍😍😍😍
KONG ! 🙈🙉🙊♥
Why are these two chicks keep fighting each other’s?
Asome
Looks like fun.
Thankful to you for complete my 5 subscribers ❤️
This has to be a joke right? It never ceases to amaze me how stupid Hollywood is getting.
Im pissed of watching this comedy video games😂
Am I the only one noticing King Kong has new scars on his chest
I want to see this flim
More panderverse bs...no thanks
That just stupid
0:30 you can see shimo there 🙂 On the right side of the building
0:31
Who tha ice guy💀
WAS THAT SUPER X???
Zor
*I Love Godzilla* 😢❤
Cool the new Kong X Godzilla X Planet of the Apes X Transformers X Avengers & more.. 😂
ulan illa godzillayı kötü bir karektere çevirip öldürtecekler
woow
Non vedo l'ora che venga il 28 Marzo In Italia
Someone yell me what their going afainst im cery confused
really enjoyed the original 2014 godzilla movie more than this avanger marvel lookin ahh. dont like the way this saga goin..
Can't wait 😫
Bring the tickets already. Can't wait to be immersed in this 3D thrill. Masterpiece 💯
based on the trailer this MF better be 3 hours long.
i love pink godzila ❤😂
If they’d make trailers that didn’t spoil the movie that’d be great!
the ice godzilla lessgo
Americans and our companies (Warner Bros. / Legendary) should never be allowed to make a Godzilla movie EVER. This is so sad. I'd rather watch a small child bang their toy monsters together over and over again. Thank God for Godzilla Minus One. An original well thought out plot with complex characters. These characters have had the depth of empty kiddie pool.
FU** 🤯
Oh my good I’m so hyped
No Doubt Awesome ❤
Excited
the next internet break movie
in next movie i wanna see fast and furious vs gozira na kong
Goosebumps overloaded ❤
the movie should have been called godzilla vs kong 2 rise of an empire
Looks so stupid, but stupid fun!
Anyone noticed that Godzilla's EMP or whatever sounds exactly like the sound we heard when they entered hollow earth?
Beast Titan (red) 🤔🤔
Shimo FANS👇
I thought in this movie fight between kong and godzilla 😂
Already seen the movie now 😂
Did like everyone just forget godzilla broke kongs arm in the last movie?
कोन कोन अपने माता पिता से प्यार करता है जौ करता है वो subscribe karo 😇
“We made some minor augmentations.” Anyone else think that this might mean that the BEAST Glove was created using parts salvaged from Mecha-Godzilla? Maybe that’s why Godzilla is attacking Kong in Egypt. Because he can sense Ghidorah’s presence in the glove.
Nais👍🎉🥳
الاهرام بتاعتنا وقعتوها ليه 😂😂
Pokolenie friza będzie zadowolone
1:17 freezing Why?🤔🤔🤔
Let's just hope this isn't the final MonsterVerse Godzilla movie...i wanna see something like Godzilla&Kong_Final Wars...but with modern CGI... Maby Destoroyah...(a monster thats just like a virus and can multiply...or Biolante...or some freakisch shiish like that 😅👍🔥💯🔥🫨
At the rate of kong/godzilla movies. It's just strange to see any infrastructure left for them to destroy
i enjoy godzilla in almost every form and fashion but we are starting to have trailers like a transformers x avengers mash up haha
Def gonna watch this
Looks sick
2024 too dhuum hoone Bala Haare  bidu 😈😈Hall pe apni sitbelt band ka Rakhne  ka nahi tooo pant Gili honesa koi nahi rokh sakta 😂😂😂
"4 Days" "20 MILLION + VIEWS"💀 YEEH THIS GONNA BE A 🗿MASTERPIECE 🔥🔥🔥
I just remembered our own old king kong 😂❤ love the power ..
In 1:51 the expression from Kong was funny
All Godzilla n Kong movie had made only this was left so it came... Seemz now a days director is not getting enough story... Seemz nothing new in 2024. Or might be human mind is not good as bfor.
Litty 🔥
I thought I've seen this somewhere, but it turns out it was a trailer for Kingdom of the Planet of The Apes.. my bad
These movies keep getting shorter but I appreciate them putting it on Youtube.
Man i love this i’ve been a huge fan of Godzilla and kong, I’m so stoked for this on march 29 if this doesn’t get elected as best movie this year i don’t know what will be better than this.
20 millions in just 4 days
வெறித்தனம் 🎉
Can't wait to see a Kaiju movie in theaters after 4 years since Godzilla King of The Monsters. Can't wait for this peak🔥🔥
Comedy zilla comedy kong 🤣🤣🤣
hey lets redo theAvengers script but with monsters instead of comic book heroes...huh hollywood?
They gotta stop releasing too many trailers, these trailers spoil the movies
Is mothra in the movie too??😢
Bro I can't wait to see shimu
well well well
Inspired by Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes.
Looks horrible
Two apex predators teaming up again! Let's goooooo!
can i get a fist bump
Avatar is nothing front of this🔥 🔥
Ok i had watched all in this trailer. bye
First time in history Kong and Godzilla Both Running away
Looks too colourful.
çok iyi lannn
Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥
Kong is TRANSORMER
Godzilla 3 kab aaegi
Godzilla 3.
This is super crazy
What are the humans doing there.. I don't they can make any difference. I don't think this will be a good one story wise.
k l ;    knn \;k.l /m               kln   \pjipnljjkj  \\   nk/
kongs Hammer thing is so much better than him relying on a machine
Bawal cheez he be 😮
neat how they showed an entire  2 hour movie in 3 minutes
We got king Kong wit the infinity gauntlet before gta6 😂
என்னோட‌ ஆவல் அதிகமாக இருக்கு எப்போ பார்ப்பேன் ன்னு
Everything seems epic about this! I wish they had a new creature as the villain instead of just a bad ape.
Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong and Yoshi
Kong really needs Godzilla right now more that ever
You can see shimo at the 31st second of the trailer
The sound of Godzilla 😱😱
❤❤
flop.....
2:31 this scene gaves me chills... Cant wait to see it in the theatres
Is it just me or someone else feeling that this time they have made more cartoonistic rather than realistic like the older movies look
Perfect goosebumps
I was almost certain this was linking to the Pacific Rim universe when they were going down that portal
This people really running out of ideas… 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
This is probably going to be terrible and dumb.  I think I'll actually go see it in the theatre.
اذا اردتم مشاهده الابطال الحقيقيون! فأدر وجهك الى ارض الابطال غزة 🇵🇸 🔻🔻🔻 هناك ستتعلم كيف تكون رجلا.
Looks beyond ridiculous. Need a few 360 shots with lens flares and it scream Michael Bay having another seizure.
this looks absolutely awful 🤣
Wack.
Godzilla Got X Legs and Kong Got O Legs😂
❤👁️🔥
That was so cool but you just showed me everything! God why do you ruin movies before they even come out.
They really be showing too much in these trailers
Pacific Rim couldve been like this
I think there will 2 godzilla..  Blue and  pink.  Are you agree with me?
This is where Kong will become King
Kong seeing Shimo: *nervous chuckle* "I'm in grave danger"
Set playback speed at 0.25 and then pause video at 2:26, is it the main evildoer Shimo?? Whoaaaaa..awesome..
So pumped for this! Love the Monsterverse and hope it still continues!!!
Who Godzilla  fans
Kong infinity gauntlet and Godzila super saiyan god amazing
Forget Baby Yoda we have Baby Kong now! 😑
Hollywood is just so cringe these days. 😅
New BGMI Update Soon! 🔥🔥🔥
😮😮😮🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:42 the original king kong vs godzilla theme from 1962
Why does the CGI look worse then the older movies????
So Kong is not alone
there's 2 godzilla???
This gonna be hella better than madem web😅😅😅
At some point it look like the rise of planet of apes but with the twist of sci-fi
They really don’t know how to stop using that same trailer formula.
I just know that when this releases in the cinemas, my ears will burst
Jaegers x kong x godzilla crossover is it doable? All the titans and kaijus.. no drama just straight up war...
The time 1:53 minutes the blue eyed was dagon (Godzilla's dad)  He died from muto prime with infection but he came back
Nice cartoon
The music at 1:16 sounds like music from an ark survival evolved boss battle
That looks absolutely terrible.
When will the 3rd Pacific Rim movie be made?
Literally crazy 😮😮😮
"They don't have to like each other, they just need to walk together" crazy. Can't wait
target audience 5 year olds.
planet of the apes, but with giants.
Blockbuster cinema doesn't get worse than this
2:18 Bro why you did our pyramid like that 💀
since when is this monkey this big?
Bro shimu is literally in there
I can't wait to see 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Broooooo🔥🔥🔥
Its a hit.
The apes are making a comeback... Escape from the Kingdom
big moster
Shimu
❤😮😮😮❤
Godzilla is way more stronger than this because he beaten up king ghidora who is way much stronger than kong or that another monkey . I think they  nerfed godzilla 😢
Not a guy with British accent 🤦
ммммммм, ху....та))))
🤣🤣🤣 WTF????!
Pubg Lover's Wait For Event 😅❤
Goosebumps 🔥🔥
So... it's an animated movie... with some scenes involving  live actor shot on a green screen, right?
They're gonna be savior's of SciFi movies.
*Well, the cameraman never dies or gets harmed.*
Great. Another CGI snore fest.
Tamil trailer release please 🥺🥺🥺
Release date ??
ima very big godzilla fan and this logs so good
20 million views already 😂
Missing that 'here we go' song
Do you think kong and godzilla will do the fusion dance?
20m vies in just four days humans really appreciate Godzilla and kong shessh
bahas ki aaakh kiya trailer he
They making monster universe into something that look like a super hero movie like the avenger type of thing. They should kept it original
I feel like the essence of Godzilla and Kong is just gone now. 🙂
I think it just a thieri but it's come  true
Can’t wait🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They showed the whole movie already 😒
movie 1: godzilla vs kong  movie 2: godzilla x kong movie 3: godzilla weds kong  movie 4: kongzilla
Garbage - Watch Godzilla -1 if you want to watch a quality movie
Goosebumps 😮‍💨😮‍💨
0:31
Amazing
If this ever becomes like minus one then I'm all up for it
this movie got even weirder
I think I see mothra in the girls eye but how?!?!?!?!
Punjab
Era good movies is officially over now it’s just a bunch of stupid movies like these and super heroes 💀
I can't wait for the monster-verse to end, I'm so tired of these, this just looks the same as the rest, for those that enjoy it, that's cool but I think the majority of these films are contrived and mediocre, even bad in many ways
Many call eagle wreck on the spot movies crown..
Godzilla & Kong running like Del Boy & Rodney is probably one of the best/worst things I've seen!
So again Phastos is the one creating stuff.... nice
I thought it was gonna have the Transformers too
New Era ❤
Bhai isne to dil le liya ❤. I am so excited 🔥
The most idiotic thing on internet I have ever seen 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm confused. Are there perhaps 2 Godzillas?
Evil monke and snow leopard vs spiked lizard and Fat monke this is gonna be epic
👍
Who else think that they found a mothra egg in the pyramids or something
bad CGI..
2:28 It looks like the tooth fairy's back won't last a night.
Waiting for this movie 🥰😊
What a movie 😱
This movie about to be fantastic
Has anyone noticed that no new films are being produced anymore? Either an old ham is being re-staged or there is a sequel.
Kong and Godzilla will never not be entertaining
its interesting to know that humans evolved from apes😊
beautiful
When will he come down?
Godzilla is now Shion Godzilla 🩷🩷🩷🩷
BRO FR IM JUST CLADDED THAT IM NOT MAKING THE MOIVE AND THERE BETTER NOT BE A PART 2
this be gonna be very fun with the other kong like monster whoo☠️☠️
We have infinity gauntlet and now kong need infinity stone
Godzilla i love you ❤❤🎉🎉
That shot of them running is probably the most badass thing I've seen
Billion dollars movie profit!!
I like these . Godzilla and GONK
Not even Godzilla's masculinity is safe..they done turned him pink..amen for Godzilla Minus one
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
i love godzilla and kong series and this looks dope 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love the silliness of these movies. no thinking just enjoy action. Nothing deep. Just pure fun. Can't wait.
Kong is Thanos and Godzilla is Goku! Let’s go! GodMonsterMode Activated!
Tokyo is back😊
True story
kinda cool, kinda cringe
Remember Godzilla vs Kong X PUBG collaboration
Mdrrr c'est n'importe quoi
I love this new full trailer cant wait to watch it 🤩🤩
Pff it's getting so cringe day after day.
Showing the whole movie in 3 minutes is wild
That’s worth watching ❤
I feel like the scar king is carnage of this movie
This is the dumbest thing ever.
Here we go again Humans are going to ruin this film again. They never learn always a fat person with jokes.
Does any one notice the Easter egg hidden in there
Shesssh ❤❤
wish it was less character development and more monster scenes...
КТО СИЛЬНЕЕ 💪?!
Lame 😑
Well what do you know he can do the atomic wave without Mothra....unless she died again.
Godzilla x kong vs shimu x scar king who's gonna win
bad
I wonder what date it will released
Godzilla 🔥 x Kong 🥶  February 19, 2024
When two departments of same university gang upon on college outsiders
LOOKS INSAAAAAANE
0:30 u  can see shin godzilla on the top right
2:34 godzilla sounds like penguinz0
KongZilla
Okay , this is what we call , next chapter or great idea 💡
Godzilla is getting brighter than the old one
0:32 Godzilla and Shimo's tails.
No
DUDE THIS GIVES ME CHILLS JUST WATCHING THE TRAILER!!!
Wow amazing 🔥
Many of these shots make the monsters look really small compared to their actual 150ft statures
This trailer says a whole lot of nothing
I am super excited for this movie
Kong❤
That villan ice godzilla is not really a godzilla type, there is a monster inside of that thing that can breath ice
Scar King got a whip
The entire movie bruh
New Enemy First Titan Shimu
Well... here comes another "Over-Hyped FlopBuster"
Kong is getting older and it saddens me
This looks like Transformers..🤦‍♂️
We need this movie...the world needs it !!
YO NO WAY WERE GETTING A GORRILA TAG MOVIE THIS IS SICK
2:43 the original King Kong vs Godzilla music reference 🥹
Aradığın Türkçe yorum burada... Godzilla ve King Kong filme çekmek yasaklansın artık amk. baydı.
Next one will have Dominic toretto helping them out because family
lol who writes this stuff???😅
this again
Godzilla Minus One looked real. This looks like a game.
🔥🔥🔥
why is godzilla 2000 in the movie
AM I THE ONLY THAT HEARD THE CHARLIE SCREAM MEME?
a super classic blockbuster that every year I always hope it will have a sequel I love kong vs gorila 😊
Epic franchise 😊
Wow
weird ahh modern cinema
Not so thrilled to be honest, they making to much of these now
Next movie is 100% complete trash the whole concept of the film is taken to the next trashy level
This looks so stupid. And they pretty much just showed you the whole movie. Sad times for cinema.
Yo I think WB is just rushing it out because of the minus one film
Godzilla: aw great another monkey😤😤😤😡😡😡
Next level ❤
Is it just me or movies looked better 10 years back?
Looks bad
2024 год будет насыщенным😮😮😮 Это просто имба❤
I'm getting Gooesbumps I SOOOOOOO CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS.  They don't gave Kong the Infinite Gauntlet.
OMG...I Love All The Purple!!!!!!!
oh!  my  Godzilla ke PAPAji
💥😊
watha veri🔥🔥
Kong marega sabko kona bhai jindabad😂
why do they not kiss the in the trailer?!? I WANT THEM TO KISS!
The exact five seconds of kong roaring picking the batle axe stopping the shimu ice breath I the best moment of the whole trailer
When I saw the giant robot looking hand (which I then realized was Kongs Gauntlet) I was like ITS JET JAGUAR!   Woulda been cooler if it was but I suppose they can only get the rights to so many Godzilla characters :/
WAAAA
Peak
One thing I noticed that scar king hit on Godzilla left hand ,but he is wearing gauntlet on right hand. How????
Goood I excited again
MORE WOMAN PLZ
After watching Godzilla Minus One I've realized this series is trash 😂😂😂
Kong-buster and GODzilla
Another flop flop from wb.. 😢😢
The fastest I ever seen Godzilla run.👀👀
As mush as I love this trailer, did anyone else recognise how humanoid godzillas run was at 2:07
Movie of the year?!?
Good blessings for everything is good with you beautiful video
This is just stupid , why don’t just call then the next avengers
wow
Please next movie about Destroyah 🥺
Goji center predicted the icebeam thingy
My most favourite series ❤❤❤
wtf is this dude.😅😅😅
This is turning into the ape movie Cesar
Nah this movie will be epic🎉
Shimo😳?
March 29 is my birthday
Mecha Kong !!!
1:09 omg
This is epic and still gonna watch but there was something so intense and jaw dropping about Godzilla 2014 focusing on how massive and intimidating he is but now it kinda looks like power rangers fightin idk
Shimo’s in the background
This trailer give me goosebumps
When Bear McCreary coming back, the Music he did for King Of The Monsters was the best, it was epic
I don't know, I feel like they're going a little bit too far with the c.g.  It could be cool but it also could be corny.  The team up scene was kind of a joke. It made me laugh a little bit , and that's the last reaction that you should have when godzilla and kong are teaming up...
This looks so incredibly stupid and I will be in a seat on March 29th.
is this based on true story?
Mothra is going to settle this rivalry between Godzilla and Kong. They just edited her out like they did in the Spiderman No Way Home trailer.
"It's not just a signal, it's a warning" 💀
boring. really hollywood this is your best?
I feel like they move so fast now compared to the first Godzilla.  I liked the sense of scale in that movie now they like full on sprinting lol
The CGI sucks.
Hello, please upscaled tutorial, how do you do it?☺☺
At 2:43 , if you listen closely it sounds like the King Kong vs Godzilla theme beat from 1962!!!
LMAO
I wonder Still People watching this kinda film?
Me back after being a Godzilla fan for 3 years and stopped.. and now seeing a Must- See movie
sigh 🙄😒
VFX LOOKS LIKE SOME SORT OF ADIPURUSH 😂😂
kong with infinity gauntlet
In 1:12,the wooooooo meme came!
In 1:25,the woooooo meme came
They make such a great duo
daebakkkk🔥🔥
0:30 mothra in her eyes
King Louie out here trying to claim the earth!!! 🌎
2:28 seeing Kong with the infinity gauntlet
I don’t get how people like these movies tbh. I guess it’s just not for me.
KONG BRO GOT THANOS GLOVES 🗿
10years of MCU greatness and it's now over.  Now we're getting this....?  Is there really no originality left in hollywood?
GODZILLAは面白くない　これはKong映画だ！
Godzilla Vs Kong set the bar really high. Hopefully this movie is better, or can at least match the Greatness of Godzilla vs Kong and other prior movies.
This looks so Super Amazing! Where's Millie Bobby Brown?
monkey fights a monkey and lizard comes to help
For one i thought tat the black guy in the ship was the baby monkey
Kong looks so cool !
this is such a nerd movie, for the nerd ppl.
3hours movie in some minutes....!?no need to watch 🤣
Why does the blonde woman look like Kate Laswell from CoD?
What have they done to these legendary characters? Looks kind of stupid.
I dunno… still doesn’t look nearly as good as Peter Jackson’s 2006 King Kong. That CGI was incredible
ultraman is watching..
Waiting for a Primal R.A.G.E movie.
Yeahhh❤❤
que pendejada acabo de ver
Evolved Godzilla looks badass! Can't wait to see Shimo too
This is so epic that I watch it every day. Imagine the movie!?
Kong fan like kare😂😂
get to work artists, marry these two
Turn off your brains and enjoy the spectacle.
Yaaaaaawn
pooper man/paper man dudes
yea this is going to be pretty dogshit, ill wait till king kong minus 1, the japanese will actually make the movie and they will make it good
ANOTHER 140 MINS OF DIALOGUES AND 10 MIN OF ACTUAL GODZILLA X KONG. PASS
Movie of the year !!!!
LONG LIVE KING GODZILLA AND KING KONG! THE SUPREME RULERS OF THIS WORLD!
The last man standing in this battle is not Godzilla, Kong, the Scar King, or Sihmo. It is Doug.
Why are they fighting again they already teamed up in 2021😂
Another dumpster fire waiting to happen.
Cyberpunk × Kong
Wow, this looks generic. No wonder creatives are afraid of AI replacement.
why is godzilla's scream at 2:34 sounds like penguinz0 screaming meme lol, is it just me?
see epik kewl monkey and gator kill different color monkey
Zeke dat you?
Godzuki  If you know, you know……
Once a legend said..." Rise together or Fall alone "
REALLLLLLL
2:27 that punch was personal 😂
Never have I wanted to watch a movie so bad
The scene where godzilla ans kong are running like super mario and luigi kills the entire thing for me.
M O N K E
Me who doesn’t know Godzilla at all but loves this:
omg
Monarch film name
Not the fan of VFX regardless, can't wait for it.
Kong and zilla. The best Frenemies! 😂
I can’t wait
We have it, godzilla is goku and kong is vegeta
This is the biggest sh*it i’ve ever seen
The solution is that Kong do the Snap 😂😅
It's cool to see Shimo!
I can Tell That This Is Gonna Be Epic Like Look At The Graphics
why is there another one???
Just get kong a giant Glock and this movie ends in 2min
Looks like they are finally letting the monsters be the stars.   I hope this movie is more Kong and Godzilla, and less human drama. That’s where it’s at its best.
0:31 0:32
Nice
Can’t wait til they get to Space
this is everything that is wrong with hollwood. Let the orientals make kaiju movies please.
Godzilla returned after valentine's day.
🎉
Movie might be trash but dang man i love big monster fights
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS!!
Salaar movie background score 😅
They done gave King Kong a power fist💀
This looks like the dumbest and most outlandish monster movie concocted by a room of idiots! I've already taken $40 dollars out of my mom's purse to see it twice
This looks so mind-numbingly dumb.  After watching Godzilla Minus One, I just can't watch this goofy take on it.
just keep the needless cringe joke dialogue to a minimum just because MCU movies do it doesn't mean it's wanted
Amazing 😍 love from India 🇮🇳
Pass. Keep the cultural brainwash agenda out of the movies. Take notes from your Japanese counterparts handling of G.
if its not mega godzilla i will be surprise.....you know these writers dont have any originality.....DEI
Damn
Can you please like this comment, it really means a whole lot to me and I’m a second grader
so Kong is fighting the planet of the apes and godzilla is fighting the mega godzilla
More like Kong vs Kong
This movie looks so hilariously bad , it may be a funny watch .
Oh sweet the new Transformer trailer dropped
DAMNNNN
The CG.
1:48 = basically Me trying to understand wtf is Hollywood smoking and cooking again.  This is some Godzilla meets King Kong meets Planet of the Apes meets Dragonball Z supersaiyans meets Power rangers.   Hollywood its time to lay off the crack.
Soooooooo that Hulk arm buster you got... is that from Stark Enterprise or naw!!!?🤔
It's insane to see what Japanese cinema is doing with Godzilla and what American cinema is doing with Godzilla
This…this..thissss we love it😍🔥 bring it on!!!🙌🏻
So basically Kong is now Thanos 2.0
so embarrassing. created in god's image and all and this is what they think merits admiration. really sad.
I AM SCREAMING!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Damn, Hollywood so out of juice these days they are trying to milk this Godzilla vs King until everyone is getting nauseous when they hear that.
What’s the monster they fighting together this time
It’s over Kong, I have the high ground. You underestimate my monkey power!
you have all these resources and a huge budget and you couldnt come with a better idea than a monkey fighting barney!!!
At 1:26 and 2:33 it sounds like moist critical. "Wooo! Yeah baby that's what I've been waiting for!" This is gonna be better than the hunger games movie he starred in.
No.
Kong and Godzilla run cracks me up 😂
Turn your brain off and just enjoy...shimo and Skar King vs Kong and Godzilla ..epic
This looks completely dumb
Return to monkey
They had to say “is that a daddy Kong”
Godzilla: Mount Everest ain't got shxt on me
BIG. MONKE.
#teamkong all day!
Bruh...Wha-😮
Let. Them. FIGHT.
Mom, can we have good CGI?  We have good CGI at home.  Good CGI at home:
GOOD
I can’t believe that fans are actually complaining about Godzilla running like a human
so much cringe
I like this trailer better than the first one
Uhhh, iszzzz Godzilla chasing Kong??????????????????
Calling all primalbots....
Looks really disappointing
These comments are too wholesome. Sus af
How many times will this monkey fight against that lizzard again? feels like the directors are about to pull that transformers thing
Godzilla X Kong? E P I C , every other movie? E P I C .
So, they wreck the pyramids and still no signs of Titanus Sehkmet? Sad
This is so stupid
Are their mothers named Martha?
Im waiting for the pacific rim cross over
Что они курят?🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
As usual Godzilla's gotta come save the day
Uh, Kong? Thanos called and he wants his gauntlet back...
Please MAKE Godzilla the best and unbeatable and scared of nothing always Please
We need a follow up on the Justice League not this!!
Are these movies real. I’m out the loop
*goosebumps
#savemothra
Their all movies gave some massage to people........ everyone enjoying the movie... But didn't understand the movie diplomacy ....some legend can understand the diplomacy ........gog magog magirhut jews......
Godzila pink ? 💩💩💩💩💩
Godzila rosa ?????💩💩💩💩💩💩
Aapka help ho sakta hai Mera  channel pe,🔥😭
Aapka help ho sakta hai Mera  channel pe,🔥😭
Aapka help ho sakta hai Mera  channel pe,🔥😭
HOW MUCH RUBISH CAN THEY PUT IN ONE MOVIE?
Warner Bros, let Legendary cook. This is the movie I've been waiting on. Probably going to see this 5×10
How can Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes get ewer views than this?
This don’t even make any sense anymore
Why is no one talking about how shimu looks exactly like Godzilla
Joke
I’ve watched this trailer 7-10 times now. Hbu guys!? 😂
2:05 Me and my bro on our way to see the movie
i love kong and his girl  i want them to get a solo movie together
I kinda miss how introducing a titan kinda came with tension but now it's just becoming Pacific rim 2
It's all fun and games until Kong starts collecting space rocks
im a simple creature, i see big monke and big lizard, Im on boards.
I think that Kong lost his arm and they replaced it with a stronger one to defeat Godzilla
His gauntlet feels like vi‘s in arcane
I'm not exactly stoked about there being other Kongs. Most of the Kong's character came from the fact he's the last. Now he'll probably beat that bald ginger and claim a harem of redheads
Pity this will never match Jurassic park's special effects.
🦖❤🦍🆚🦧❤❄️🐊🆚🦋
I thought this a a fakethumbnail bu it's real
Caesar from Planet of the Apes got giant and learned ninjutsu and now he's using a kusarigama. That wasn't on my godzilla bingo sheet. Kong also getting a power glove and being the ape that works with humans against murderous apes is very original and absolutely not just the plot of Congo without Tim Curry's Russian accent. If the humans rig up a laser gun at the end of the film to fight off the bad guy apes then it really will be Big Congo.
😂 Another one? Come on Hollywood! I guess folks at the top need to start thinking about retirement 🤦
also is godzilla walking on the ocean then dives deeper into the ocean i never understood that
Thanks dont need to see the movie now.
This is so like... a Video Game 😣
we had Minus one that was a fantastic call back to OG Godzilla movies and a great emotional epic. Then we have this a epic action movie with amazing spectacle. us Godzilla fans eat good.
No matter how many times Hollywood producers insist on doing it, I never get tired of either the Pyramids, or the Golden Gate Bridge getting annihilated! Haven't we all wanted to do this?
Godzilla : Kong if your gauntlet fails you know we need to do the plan B right? Kong : oh no  "FUUU SIOOONNN HAAA"
Honestly feels kinda meh. Not so hyped to watch it. Sure I'll watch it, but not exactly built up to do so.
Shinto🥶🥶🥶🥶
This isn’t a giant monster movie, this is a superhero team-up
Too country, Japan's set designs and concepts, always not very convincing, and not harmonic, with those purple lights, worse.. and boxoffice will fail as always... Don't know why USA is still wasting money on this gozilla related thing.
This & Deadpool trailers out at the same time. What a gift we've received.
This movie looks Insane
I know the signal sting is supposed to be ominous, but I cannot stop hearing moistcritikal's victory screech instead
Cyborg arm kong and super saiyen rose zilla team up
Why do they look...small? I can't explain it.
If the film is as good as the trailer we are in for a ride
Damn i can't wait to see godzilla and kong fight together against skar king 😍😍 i already want to it to be march to see it on the big screen 🔥🔥🔥🤩
Bro that one camel at the beginning of the trailer that just disappeared 🤣😭
Godzilla coming out in pink 🤢🤮
bro i see shimu I'm excited to this movie❤❤❤😮😮
It was nice of MoistCr1tikal to allow Legendary to use his "Woooo" in the trailer :)
Woo can't wait
good dumb fun . . . cant wait
Everything not in the trailers is them walking about kong and godzilla I bet and a bunch of flying around on planes.
Kong 🤝 Godzilla
Everyone saw "KING GHIDORAH" back in 2019, he fought with Godzilla. But in this case, when will the studios introduce "MEGAGHIDORAH"? I love ghidorah, a best powerful allie to battle against Godzilla. But I'll see soon
They turned Kong into Kratos !!!
❤❤❤
Imagine Shimu gets pregnant to Godzilla 👀
Did king kong just obtained the infinity gauntlet lol
Kong vs McGilla?
Feels like Kong wearing part of iron man's Mark 5. In the last scene. Feel's awesome
They had to get the woke character in🤦‍♂️
Why is cgi getting worse as time goes on I know a lot of people will jump up and say it looks fine…no it doesn’t 😂
I am still *phenomenally* pissed off that they gave this movie to that dipshit Adam Wingard, especially after the horror show that was GvK, but I am genuinely excited for this one. Especially if we get to see more Kong. Hopefully we can stop seeing Godzilla being saved by plot armor now. Probably wont, but still.
🔴Kenapa indonesia gak tayang?? Malah film2 setan yang di up ya alloh...
Kong barber where can I find him to do my beard? 😅😅😂
This is going to be FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!
cant wait
I think surprisingly that I preferred the godzilla movie in 2013 where godzilla had a total of like 20 minutes screen time. At least that one had a decent story line and characters that I actually cared about.
Kong looking like Kratos
thx to creators for this, I'm in Ukraine. I hope I will be alive and will watch this legendary movie
I’m sorry Doomfist overwatch it’s not the infinity gauntlet
This looks like dogshit
サプライズでモスラ出てきそうな雰囲気。しらんけど
1:41 1:56 2:27 2:46
Probably worse than Monarch
March 29th is my birthday 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Remember when the first movie was just Godzilla vs the Muto and the normal US military had to intervene??? Yeeeah… Now look…🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
CGI cutscene. Just lame they use them for movies in 2024.
Seems like God's name is taken is vain, so for me I doubt I will watch it.
Best trailer I've ever seen in my life! 🔥👏🏽
I have a feeling Kong is dying and mini Kong will take over.
Oh boy, now King Kong is robotic and friends with Godzilla, fighting again, themselves or whatever... is it just me, or milking this 2 characters has gone way too far and repetitive at this point? They can't come up with something new and different, so they keep reviving old stuff to milk one more movie... bruh 🤑🤮
2:25
Ta insanooo
I hope the human characters screen time is the same in the trailer.
Kong and Godzilla running together like some lame cop buddy movie. Wow awful
This is gonna be garbage, but I'll enjoy every second of it.
Every Time i watch a Godzilla or a Kong film my whole body is in that WORLD its CRYZY
Who want's the last slice of pizza?  Godzilla x King Kong: 2:07
Godzilla 2014 will be the only good thing to come from this series and it’s almost 10 years old now
can't wait for it
Kong got an arm like Jax from mortal kombat you know he gonna knock some heads
Dumb
How dare scar king do that to kong 😤
I am nearly 40 and I am absolutely buzzing now for this film. Wasn't to impressed with the first trailer but this one looks pretty good.
1.Godzilla vs Kong 2.Godzilla x Kong 3.Godzilla 🤍 Kong 💀💀💀
Trash CGI Movie
When bro said "it's not just a signal..." I slick thought he was about to say "it's a warning.." 😂
This seems..... REALLY stupid.
I don’t wanna see another movie, where Godzilla will be beaten by everybody
looks dumb
all I can hear is MoistCr1TiKaL screaming all the time 1:13 , 1:26 , 1:57 , 2:33
WE BOUTA BE ENTERTAINED WITH THIS ONE 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'll never understand how Kong: Skull Island pulled off having such a stacked ensemble cast
ляяяя....какое же форменное гуано
Planet of the Kongs
I. Love 🦧🦎🧰📿
Where's Godzuki! 😂
Господи, ну и дичь! Когда эта бездарность закончится...
Godzilla: i am pink i am girl now nooooo Kong: HEY Barbie!
Rosé Godzilla 😍😍🤝🏽
So, did you swallow your tongue?  No but I just bit it.
Se a luta final for no Rio de Janeiro , vai ser épico
Chat this might be it The best movie of Godizilla VS Shimu / The Scar Kong VS Kong 2V2🗿🏆
Shut Up And Take My Money💰💰💰💰💰
Wow the movie felt so electric! This is going to be the most epic blockbuster summer hit ever!
get ready for another mediocre film!
vai ser ruim pra krl, mas eu quero mt ver n tem jeito
Kongs favorite little girl must've trimmed that beard or they put him to sleep to trim it so perfectly lol
Un gros navet US de plus
I want an Honest Trailer for this Trailer!
words cannot describe how trash this looks
Wait now. People keep saying Shimu has the Pink dorsal fins. So where is Godzilla? Or does Godzilla have the pink dorsal fins now? If that's the case, where is Shimu?
excited is an understatement. i cannot wait!
Kong con el guantelete del infinito, asi cualquiera gana.
I have a feeling that scene with Godzilla and Kong sprinting will be at the end
looks pretty dumb... I'm in!
This is going to be sick
Kong vs Long
it's kong vs another kong and Godzilla vs another godzilla(shimu) right?
They make kong 10 ft taller every new movie . He'll be as big as the moon in by 2056
Hollywood is out of ideas. Nothing new. This vs that and bla bla
Ya la neta no le veo sentido a estás películas de king Kong la animación ya la veo como si la hiciera algún chaval de un canal por ahí de animación en YouTube ya no es creíble de que un mono gigante y Godzilla anden por ahí atrás de mi casa ya lo siento exagerado y de mala calidad
Its Planet of the Apes 2.0 Could ben a lot better Villain then a skinny old red monkey .
The bar is so low. Ridiculous!
kong look like thanos dude
Everything you see on this movie is a lie but it's amazing.
One giant slobber knocker coming up.
This better not disappoint. Its in my birth month
Godzilla x Kong  Summerslam Tag Match  Roar is war
That first scene with the giant fist I fr thought they added transformers into the story 💀
Is kong slowly getting bigger or is Godzilla shrinking?
Why do the monsters look so much less realistic than the 2014 Godzilla?
Wkwkwk.. makin kesini makin kesana😅😅
These bullshits never end.  Next time make it more bigger.
I hope these two meet pacific rim
This looks hella silly but this is what movies are for.
Well up for this, looks great.
OMGGG!! GODZILLA VS KONG IN CAIRO!!?!???????
If you see godzilla running you that who ever there fighting is fu*ked
THE NEW EMPIRE!!!
GODZILLA AND KONG!!!!
YESSSS!!! FINALLY TRAILER!!!
Godzilla moves to wrong for a billion ton being
i wonder if they're going to whip out destoroyah for this one
so dumb
Lol
This is LEGENDARY
I would love to watch this in 3D or something. Can’t wait to watch it tho
Blud wasn’t build for shimo 💀
2:28 Destroyah claw ?? 😅
I felt that the previous movie had elements of King Kong vs Godzilla, King Kong Escapes, and Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla. with this movie i feel that there is going to have elements of War of the Gargantuans in it with Godzilla thrown in. does anyone else get that vibe as well?
Honestly cant wait for it! It looks awesome!
I hope this move will have some flashback scenes, like how Scar King controlled the BIG GIRL (Shimu)
am I the only one who thinks godzilla verse is becoming funnier XD
Remember when kong kong and godzilla weren't dumb action movies for kids....
Now Godzilla don't feel like Godzilla 🤬, it feels like a dude just doing martial arts.   In past days, Godzilla was scary due but now it's a fight for territory.
After the Japanese Gozilla version, sorry for any other Hollywood Godzilla version
You ever a song that sounds like it was written just to write it and they needed to fill an album.  This movie looks like a movie that was written just to write a movie
Ted Lasso
Boring series
Oh man. This is going to be COMPLETE TRASH. They not even trying to make good movies no more smfh
Super Saiyan Rose Godzilla and Infinity Guantlet King Kong vs Curious George
Can’t wait!
Bro the twist I'm calling it, the people underground will be the Toga people and Megalons gonna show up outta nowhere.
This feels like a Kong with the Infinity Gauntlet and Super Saiyan Rose Godzilla vs Blades of Chaos Skar King and Super Saiyan Blue Shimu.
Doomfist is that you? 😂
What rose from the lava?
Damn im too exicted
Yo is that a second Godzilla or???
This movie is boring
Wow so cool ❤🎉
Wtf did I just watch
i want more kongzilla and less humans...PLEASE!
everything is great EXCEPT the gauntlet for some reason not sticking with me
Bro wtf have these franchises become to??? Get ur marvel super hero aww movie out of here…
Anyone else notice the gauntlet locked in with the og gvk theme?
Kong the Planet of the Apes
3 minutes trailer, I feel like I watched the whole movie
Optimus primal vs megatron
why is the godzilla pink? Is it Godzillara ? Female Gojira
whattt ta dog doinn
im exsighted?
cancelen esa madre
Dude godzilla is gonna unlock ultra instinct in the next one
we got subzilla fellas
Seriously WTF?
Kong with gautlet and stormbraker and zila with kaioken 10x AMAZING!!
Fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee😂  It gonna blow scale for sure
WTF IS THIS MOVIE 🤣 bro got an infinity gauntlet and stormbreaker 🤣
Oh man they really have ran out of ideas
Soy el like 455 k
I'm almost sure moistcritikal's "wooooh" is being used here for the distorted sound lmao
All of this looks waaaayyyyy to CGI and super cliché. They should work on animatronics for these two and that third one with the chained whip looking gadget.
im glad they able to fight together ni
Godzilla ❤️‍🔥🫡
Man, I wish these things were real. Just not anywhere around my city.
Looks like trash and is nothing in comparison to Godzilla: Minus One
28 days after my birthday
0:30 Mothra
I'm THERE! 😍😍😍😍😍
:D trailer made me laugh... tho im happy to see them together as a team!
That evil monkey def rips kong’s hand off or sumn
idc, this looks pretty epic. i dont always need a slow oscar worthy movie with 3 hours of dialogue and trying to be deep, just 2 hours of carnage and fun, is also fun
Probably the movie of the year
I just wish I could see what those two will be up against!
Kong with infinity gauntlet and stormbreaker. Damnn the world gonna be end game
Look it doesn't have to be pure cinema, we all know big monsters fighting will be fun to watch lmao
2:27 you can see Shimu's head for a split second
Finally. a trailer where you don't know what the heck is going on hahah.
OMG! What's next? THANOS versus KONG and GODZILLA... why don't we throw in the mix ROCKY BALBOA?... this is becoming so ridiculous!
So who exactly is the villian here??
This looks good man good movie
Who is villain in this movie?
I called it !!! The moment they made the Ultra Trash Kong vs Godzilla movie that literally killed the whole franchise, this sort of trash would definitely followed up. Another top tier God level Trash Godzilla x Kong, What's next ?!! Godzilla & Kong (Romeo & Juliet) or The fellowship Of The Wild (LOTR but with 1mill godzilla & kong) 🤣
I like the part where Godzilla goes rawr
Transzilla
Wtf is with that awful Audio when the titans shriek LOL. Its 2024
Big ice girl I coming
I can't wait to see this movie but how it Godzilla change colours ones he is blue and ones he is pink
Now THIS is a trailer!
I’m for it!
1:53 shimu🥶
Опять очередной фильм про сильных и независимых женщин в главной роли. Не удивлюсь, если Конг и Годзилла будут геи
Is nobody going to talk about how we might have A MOTHRA in THIS ?!!!!
Thanks, now it finally looks like the trash of the original Japanese films. Ridiculous.
👎🏼
Look at my name guyz
Why is CGI so bad nowadays? We are moving backwards, not forwards. This movie looks like a videogame with real actors here aand there
🐒 vs 🦎
I hope Kong have more screen time in this movie 😂😂😂😂
Godzilla has his atomic pulse let’s goo
Who’s the blue thermo Godzilla?
Эх, по качество всё дальше и дальше походят на мультик😂 Как же не хватает первых частей Конга и Гадзиллы
0:31 at slow motion,i saw 2 godzillas
i wonder how their babies will look (⊙o⊙)
2:28 I don't know why I thought that was a lobster claw
these movies are the pinnacle of consumerism i swear lol
I'm afraid this movie gonna be the "Pacific Rim Uprising" for the monsterverse. Uprising failed to deliver "realism" like the first movie because of the fast movement of those massive jaegers. and judging by this trailer so far, the movements of godzilla and kong is absurdly fast considering their size. not to mention about the CGI being worse, make them more like cartoons this time. i hope they can improve it when the full release came
Godzilla with super Saiyan rosè 🥶
1:41 fight sence epic
"Even they are scared of it"   Godzilla: "I ain't scared no ice"
Stupid movie
Pls 50 subscribers
WTF
🤣🤣
That pink kamehameha wave looks really good.😄
trailer needs more cinematic bass hits
Its not a film, its a videogame
Imagine peter Jackson made a Kong & Godzilla Movie. 💯
The white breath says it ⚡
superb trailer can't wait to see 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sounds almost like the KKvG theme at the timestamp 2:43 if you listen closely.
Damn. Altho I thought that the new villian was going to be Ghidorah
Blood got a power fist on 💀
Ionox for sure
Kong - Iron Kid Godzilla - Super Saiyan Red  Scar King - Indiana Jones  What's Next.........😅😅😅
How I wish I could see the Majestic Queen again on the KOTM Universe movie 🦋
Waiting for shimo
Godzilla x Kong? Cmon you’re killing us anime fans
Cant wait for the Pitch Meeting about this one!
Can’t wait for this movie
If The New Empire can continue the winning streak of Minus One, Godzilla movies, and all monster movies in general, could take a page or two out of these movies
lança quando?
When Godzilla transformed into a human Godzilla is a female woman
How can Godzilla swim? If he can stand in the ocean literally like theres no water in it. 😅
seems to become pretty dumb xD
Are there 2 Godzilla's in the film...?
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaa yeee
Damn...im in
I will never tire of big, epic, ridiculous monster movies. So ready for this!!!
Looks amazing just idk why Godzilla is being painted as the bad guy
Waiting🎉
Planet of the Apes featuring Godzilla
DAMN
😮😮dammnnn  this trailer is epic... Can it be the release day tomorrow 😭😭
We need a tamil  trailer 🙋
the ending : godzilla walks back to the sea
I have an idea. How about y'all make a movie from the monsters perspective. Like ALL ABOUT THE MONSTERS. I'm sick of the humans side story overpowering the movie about nothing. Give us a Godzilla origins story or something. Him/her growing up to become the badass we know about 🤷🏾‍♂️
- My friend: why do you like Godzilla, it’s just big monsters fighting each other.  - Me: BIG MONSTERS!!
Epic!! Simple epic!!
The humans better not ruin another movie.
Still Waiting 🎉
Kong and Godzilla buddy cops next
Kong and King Zilla bout to be crazy

Godzilla x Kong = Legendary
Shimo crying in the corner
And then, comes... Cthulhu. Just kidding, folks.
Fact is Godzilla is more powerful than Kong but I wished that Kong were more powerful 😢
😊😊😊
I like kongs infinity gatlut

They are definitely 😁 coming in #PUBG and #BGMI ❤❤
This is definitely in my bucket list

How the f Godzilla got Super Saiyan rose😮😮
It's going to get messy haha
Pink Godzilla sucks.  Why change something that'a already perfect?
0:30
Holymollyyyyyyyyyy Shimu Vs Godzilla Scar vs Kong can't waitttttt
Their beef will never end.
"Now I have seen everything." Yeah, that's a great quote for a trailer that shows everything.
This some bs
If anything, this definitely looks like it’s going to be fun.
Finally Kong and bumble bee work together 🔥🔥🔥
It’s getting ridiculous..
New Titan is coming!!!
The next Dolby Atmos Reference🤪
I don't care who calls a big monke and a dinosaur fighting stupid. Monsterverse is so damn enjoyable
Godzilla vs shimo🥶
Near to Me-Kong: Mecha Kong and Li-Go: Lighting-Godzilla 🤔🤔🤔
🦍vs🦧 Godzilla vs Shimo ❄️❄️❄️
Wolverine can beat all three any day of the week and twice on Sunday
Can we all agree Godzilla would win no matter what?
Thanos had infinity gauntlet and Thor had stormbreaker but guess what Kong has both

No words can describe how excited I am for this. 💯🙌🏻
Planet of the Kongs
Pubg players are you ready ???
pretty sure its going to end up being kong and the other monkey vs godzilla in  a plot twist and decieving trailers, godzilla getting mind controlled and weaponised then super charged with nukes
I got my fancy dinner with Minus One. Now I'm ready for some fast food.
0:32
0:31
So where is Kong’s iron man suit?
0:25 I thought that was an unibrow for a moment lmao
i saw shimu so he is  gonna be in the movie
they start to lack imagination to make movies now.
Dare I say that even Barbie influenced Godzilla? Pink looks great on everyone 🩷
Why are they attacking Godzilla
They keep giving kong more weapons cuz he can’t keep up to save his life
I watched this trailer almost 10+ times daily watching
Planet of the Apes and this.
What a great time to be a Godzilla fan! I am excited to see Godzilla’s new look and atomic pulse for the first time (yes I am aware know about KOTM’s nuclear pulse but that’s a different one)
I miss gloomy monster verse.... 🥲🥲
I got chills when he said “ it’s a call for war
I can't wait to see this awesome movie with my wifey we have the first one on dvd
Where is Mothra 😢😢
so... who are the villains? Orangutan Kong?
This movie is going places :D
epic
Transform and roll out kong
They done very bad to that new ape about the belt of bones 😩really is he is badazz villian of 90s movie
So a little backstory: I’m currently living with my grandparents since my Maw is 89 years old and my Paw is 90 years old. Been taken care of them for about three years since Hurricane Ida hit Louisiana. My maw has Dementia and so she forgets a lot, pretty quickly. She and my paw enjoys westerns, game shows, maw with her stories, paw with his gardening shows, they both like sports more so paw, and my maw with her monsters movies.   About ten minutes ago, while we were watching church, I told my maw about the new Godzilla and King Kong movie, she lit up with excitement. I ended up showing her this trailer and she was so hype to see the them working together to overcome a new threat. To give y’all more context, on how much she is a fan of the monster movies, she has a figurine of Godzilla that she got at a Christmas some years ago and still looks at and plays with it when we and her remembers about it. Also got a dvd on King Kong and Godzilla for a Christmas and she enjoys watching it, if she remembers it. She also watched most if not all the movies at least two to three times, over her life. Since she doesn’t remember them at times, it’s like a new movie to her every time she sees one. Whether it’s from the thirties or something recent, she most likely saw it. With a smart tv, she was able to do that.  Seeing her excited face when watching this trailer was so cool to see, and when she saw the March 29th release date she looked at me with even more excitement. Now she isn’t able to walk or use the bathroom by herself anymore, so my mom, my little cousin, my three sisters and the nurse we have, helps her with that while also helping her at night and in the morning to get out of bed. So since she can’t go to a movie theater, if she’s still around when it comes out on dvd it’s going to be an amazing time having the family around watching this with her.   PS: Before anyone else says why don’t I help her get out of bed or help her with the bathroom, I want to, but she would rather a women to help her out. She doens remember my paw and I helping her before everyone else getting her dress and changing her diapers. That’s fine because I help make sure they (my grandparents) take their medicine, make sure they eat and didn’t things like that.
Nahh I can't wait
Is there any 2 godzillas
First trailer was better
O sum 🎉🎉
Why make gloves for Kong instead of a Glock 18?
People pause in 2.27 sec you will see shimu face😂😂😂😂
what next? kong and godzilla will drink wine together ?
Uuuugh I'll just wait for the new Planet of the Apes movie to come out.
SHIMU!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!! LEZZZGOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyone else feel like Godzilla was barley in this trailer?
KONG... KEK.

Skar king riding shimo 0:31

Very cool!
Chaotic combo
Gonna watch this in IMAX 4D
What are we even doing? This looks absolutely retarded.
What’s up with the pagan stuff?
2:26we see Shimo on the side of scar king😊😊😊
I still don't know who's the enemy 😂😭
Please tell me the big bad is an orangutan , it looks ridiculous this is gonna be a miss for me
Godzilla got the greatest power-up of all, some hands to throw.
2:27 if u slow the vid down to the max u can see Shimo in the left corner first official face look of him
I´am flashed. That will be great :)
When is godzilla x Kong: gender wars coming out.
They gave Kong the Doomfist
please stop making stupid movies ...
This is a  sequel to Godzilla vs Kong but without the 2
Is it just me or there's Penguinz0 scream at 1:26 ?
I think its only the Kong empire  😎
so they're fighting a hostile red ape now?
Can't keep uo with thus who's what and who's what smfh
Ждём коллаборацию с этим фильмом, в пабг мобайл)
dude did u see shimo 2;27
I’ll be there
Unilism
Monkey Dino Fight Movie 4!!
There's a theory going around that Gia will be able to telepathically communicate with a new Titan.  And I know who it is. In her vision at 0:30, you can see and pause at the right time in her eyes a reflection of a giant titan, and it kind of looks like Mothra.   So she might be able to telepathically communicate with Mothra.
godzilla and kong looks ok and watchable so i will go and watch it in the cinema i just hope actors in this movie arent so awful and bad like it seems right now because i am afraid i will enter the extreme disappointed mode and then rage mode which will be not so pleasant experience for other folks i just cant hold it anymore, i cant take and absorb awful and superficial personality of the actors anymore, and overacting is hard to watch too you must understand me, for 25 years i was watching absolutely brilliant talented actors, and then this came...modern actors makes me vomit
I found shimo
Humans weaponized Kong. Godzilla is not happy. Mini Kong is throwing rocks at his gradfather, whats not to like here?
2:31
💯💯💥🔥🔥🔥🔥
There is a new blue huge monster thats fighting godzilla at 31 seconds you have to pause to see it what amazing details
Guys if u pause exactly at 31 seconds u can see kong fighting with scar kong amd godzilla fighting a huge blue monster looks like a ice moster but double the size of godzilla and if u pause to the red clock zoom in and u can see mothra in the red i think mothra is back and a new monster epic details
i am here for the giant orangutan
The only movie I'm excited like as marvel movies♥️😊
I went to the cinema Saw "Madame Web" poster  About to go home "Godzilla x Kong: The new Empire" poped up "Fck yo Madame Web im watching 2 big guys"
This isn't Godzilla.  This looks so silly.
1:39
First full procedurally generated film?
Wow just wow they give them ss rose and gauntlet.
Who's using Ice Beam?   From the looks of it, we're not getting Destoroyah just yet. Personally, I'm up for that, but I'd prefer if it was a Godzilla only villain.
I thought they came to an understanding in the last movie, why are they seeking violence again
1:38 Жаль он не сел жопой на экран
Yeah but king kong is monkey
Marvel movies is the action we deserve, but this movie is the action we need right now..
KONGFIST
Is a buddy cop movie now, sure, why not?
Chlo ab BGMI ko 3.1 update ke liye kuch mil gya 😅😅
Wait Godzilla can run now??
Why do I love these movies so much, cant wait
greatest collab ever
Shimo is here
Is there more than 1 Godzilla
epic
This Legenday Godzilla is kinda a circus.  Heisei era was pure extravaganza, but still, it had something beautiful and almost mystical to it.  This is like transformers
This is looking more like pacific rim 2 😂
That punch though
wakanda's gave him bucky's hand
King Kong x Godzilla: The Dawn of Justice
Dayumm  King of the monsters  Vs Creator of the monsters
❤🔥🔥🔥
This is everything I wanted.  Except for the human side to it.  That part is always lame.
Shimo! Can’t wait for the movie 🔥
1:52 Is that Shimo?!?!
Bigger, dumber, louder... When will America learn?
Total scrap :(
Y manque la technique des ombres de shikamaru et y’a tout
So, this movie is about evil kong and evil godzilla vs godzilla and kong?
The amount of bots praising this nonsense of a money-laundering movie simply defies logic!!!
The buddy cop movie I’ve been waiting for.
1:26 why is it like I heard it at a meme
The most unnecessary thing in these movies are the Humans. Remove these clowns please.
The trailer  ❤❤😊😊
godzilla fear nothing
I can’t wait for next month
I have a theory shimu is a girl and if somehow godzilla is shimu's son but its just a theory
Infinity Gauntlet Kong,Super Saiyan rose Godzilla vs Scar kong with a bone whip
Glad to see Godzilla embracing his inner cod lobby
Waiting for non binary Kong and Godzilla
Yorumlardan ünlü olmaya çalışıyorumI'm trying to become famous from the comments
#GodzillaXKongTheNewEmpire  #godzillaxkong #warnerbros #legendarypictures #adamwigard #hollywoodmovies #hollywood  This is epic of a trailer. Godzilla × Kong the new empire, this is a much awaited movie for sure. Godzilla the Titan and Kong the ape will fight together against a new enemy which has not been revealed in the trailer particularly of what exactly is it. The bgm is gona give you the goosebumps when godzilla and Kong clash. Will they work together and as the trailer goes it seems so. Titans the gaudians of nature and Great Apes the protector of humanity, the bgm in the timeframe when this dialouge cone off is like wow. Kong has been provided with a Epic Gauntlet to challenge the unknown war enemy as there is a war call. We are gonna view a big war scenes as per the trailer.  When Godzilla comes to play it releases electric energy and that powerful blow just removed a big teeth of the ape. The scene with  a mini Kong is super it shows ready for the challenge. The scene what follows shows Apes banging on ground which will raise the curiosity of what are we gonna witness on this movie. Will this movie beat the other movies of this series? The next scene follows Kong facing a big ape with some sort off chains, wow that is over the board. Next scene where the scientist says we have made minor augmentation follows a big challenge between Kong and a ape which will for sure blow the kid when watched on big screen.
goofy aah money making machine
out of ideas lol
-1
Ohhh THANK GOD THEY HAVE THE BLUE GODZILLA

We'll have like 3 mins of godzila and Kong and the rest will be humans running around.
Please don't copyright Doguqn Studio anymore, please, the man is working for you.
This is incredible 🔥🔥
So is there a point where Kong goes blonde and Godzilla shrinks into a sleek ultimate form? It seems like they wrote themselves into a corner here.
Who else smells a dud
2:26 🔥
Looks like jumping the shark
Кажется я описался

Looks so fckn stupid
Almost had me in the first half
IDK maybe. Still loving Godzilla -1
this is actually the coolest and the best sci-fi movies i've ever watch. no cap
budget is out hahahah
Megatron will show up
Space godzilla im calling it 🖐
Red monke boi: I am inevitable   Kong: and I am…king kong
I can't wait to see how strong enough Kong and Godzilla to Save Human being 😊
"He won't be alone"  Literally 🥶🥶
Na
Waiting 4 this Epic in Cinemas 🙌🙌🔥🔥
Looks like garbage. 60% cartoon 40% ugly short haircut
Kong💪
Good 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
It’s actually so cool seeing Godzilla and Kong working together 😂
this movie need s
Maine puri cinema dekh li
Bro wtf are they fighting? I’m confused
Yes!
Super sayain Godzilla vs ragna Godzilla 🔥🔥 now this will be epic!!!
I wished Dr sirizawa was alive and in series to see Godjira achieving super sayain rose,mecha Godzilla and now ice Godzilla his reactions would be amazing 😂
I feel like Kong beat skar kings asz on hollow earth that's why he use shimo haha
2:07　走るゴジラ&ゴングの元ネタ
Godzilla is the only legacy franchise Hollywood hasn't destroyed yet. Fingers crossed
Ah yes I love how the second trailer looks like the first one
Why do I feel like i saw the entire movie in one trailer 🤦
this BS franchise need to stop meanwhile shin and earth Ltao
i hope this movie boutta be like 3 hours
Monsterverse fans will have goosebumps pretty sure
Batman=its not a signal its a warning This Movie=its not just a signal its a invitation for war
Love it, hopefully now that Kong got his time to shine in GvK there can be more of a 50/50 split with our boys, Serizawa knew Godzilla was more than a monster after all so let the big guy have his moments (I know why they did what they did in GvK, and seeing Godzilla as a kinda annoyed king proving to the new blood why he is the OG is actually a great way to watch it but he was literally just presented as evil for like 80% of the film, it was kinda frustrating)
29 March 2025...⚠️
Anyone know how big shimu is?
Scylla, Godzilla, Kong, Skar King, Shimu, Mothra, and maybe even Rodan? This is gonna be peak
wow i'm excited goosebumps
2:27 shimo
Releasing date in india?
Wow, it's like 85% of the movie.
Goosebumps ; - ;
Hmm, is this the new season of Naruto?
KONGZILLA 😀👍
Muazzam bişey 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
MONKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I wish we could get some monarch characters cross over
Did you guys notice Suko punching Skar King along with Kong? Watch it in slow mo
IF I HAD TO CHOSE BETWEEN GODZILLA I'D CHOSE KING KONG100%
Are there 2 godzilla?..I wish shimo will be the main villain
Ye sab to pubg mai aa chuka hai 2 saal ho gye 😅
Oh, Gojira can run.....
March 29 has never seemed so far 😭
Godzila purple and blue ? :'( what happen
1:34 is that a kongress 😂
BIG MONSTERS VS BIG MONSTERS!! YES!!!
Kong got bumblebee hand
Wow, another one😒
Team Godzilla
0 like ❤😢
Am I the only one who's hearing moistcr1tikal's scream at 1:26
uhh. why does kong have a fake tooth like my dad
I’m so confused as to what we’re supposed to be seeing here.
Then Godzilla said "It's kongin time" 😂🤡🤦
Kong>Godzilla and Iove both
Godzilla + Kong + A Quiet Place + The Planet of the Apes + Transformer 💀
TEAM GODZILLA 🔥🔥✅
From today me being Godzilla till march 29 ❤
Im gonna assume that Scar King is gonna serve as a sort of evil mastermind and Shimu is his superweapon. Also its good to know that Kong is definitely not the last of his kind, officially
Iron-kong? What lame producer came with the idea of a metal glove? This looks bad
Kong face when he saw shimo was like "Aint no way they got me squaring up with this big ahh ice breaker"
Bumblebee lost hand 😂😂😂
Man did godzilla do cardio 😂
Man this movie dont need a great story. All it needs is big dino action and im satisfied enough
This looks absolutely ridiculous.
What it sounds like when Optimus Prime is hitting backshot 2:41 :
bad CGI
Apes follow koba now 😂😂
Why godzilla nd Kong fighting again, is it new godzilla like villain?
what if mecha Ghidorah was in the movie it would be fireeee 🔥
This movie will have a good scenes
Looks trash
MONSTER BATTLR BEGIN
Every single scene is giving me Goosebumps  Detailed @ it's peak
IT'S SO RIDICULOUS LEZZGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Soooo..... Who is the villain of this movie?? Is it scarking or something else?
Looks like CGI vomit...
From the first trailer I thought scar king would be atleast triple the height of kong😂
Plot twist: this is only happening in the little girls mind
In india we say it sabse bada vivad bhaisahab 😊😊
What a load of poppycock
02:33 Godzilla transforming into Super Saiyan Blue By Saying That's my bulma
So Curious George and Barney are teaming up now? Not bad, not bad at all.
We need dancing Godzilla back
Fact - Shimu is talk of the town
This movie will still won't beat godzilla minis one. It is the best godzilla movie ever. Nise try legendary. But still the human characters not good. And cgi. To much kong and you all are disrespecting godzilla by making him skinny.
I've been fan of Kong since childhood, and i don't like anyone overpowering Kong. These dumb people nerfed kong just to show that Godzilla has upper hand. Compare kong now and in king kong you'll notice it too
I am very excited
Who see mothra rebirth/coming back 👇
Why do we love Godzilla so much? He always destroys a whole city and kills a lot of people to fight a monster. Why doesn’t he fight the monster on a deserted island
Fast & Furious but with Kaiju
People who saw shimu 👇
what a stupid film
Yeah full movie in one trailer
I am waiting for godzilla kong update in pubg
Triangle x monkey
The quality of the monster is evolving with years and now it's like real toys fighting before one was better
Great
plz release GODZILLA MINUS ONE
It is stilll same story. I thought that it would  be something very different and new in this monstervers, but it not tha epic.
Its old now.... Not have that much charm on today's date
Uo Next: Kong x Godzilla x Will Smith.
Lol…..how am I seeing 100/150 ft monsters coming out of 5’’2 inches of screen…😂
thanks i trailer. I just watched the whole movie
🔥🔥🔥
Deepan vs aravind ❎ Deepan x aravind ✔
It’s not just a mini kong… it’s a mini orangutan which is probably scar kings kid
Electric Thanos Thor  Kong is trash
Omg
No way it’s not scar kings son I will not think otherwise until I see the whole movie but just by the trailer… no way it’s not scar kinda son
It’s scar kings son
What's better than Godzilla vs Kong,         2 Godzilla vs 2 Kongs
at the beginning, seeing the metal arm, I tot it was another Transformers movie 😅
Great
Aight so who do we think the real enemy kaiju gonna be cause aint no way its just more great apes. Im hoping for something big like Destroyah or well...  its still probably to soon to hope for Gigan or Orga isnt it... Well im hoping for Destroyah!
This movie is going to be epic!
damnnnnnnn 🔥
Wait he hurt disleft why is it on his right
I don't understand what is going on, but reality is no more I guess
Release Coyote vs Acne. Stop cancelling movies for the tax write offs.
This looks sick!
Damn look at that Kong's beard what a Gigachad he became
Monke
So basically its Godzilla x Kong x Transformers Rise of the Beasts x Planet of the Apes ?? Anything else am I missing ?? 🤔🤨
How tf did this franchise go from an ape fighting for the love of his life to him fighting evil alongside a giant atomic lizard?!?😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Godzilla's roar is very horrible.
This looks pretty meh actually
King Kong will always be my favorite because I have the memories of watching the one with jack black with my grandma almost every time I went there when I was a kid what I’d do to have that time back
Donkey Kong x Yoshi... with Didi Kong.. vs the Planet of the Apes...
Godzilla after 2019 doesn't make any sense...Infact  Hollywood after 2018 doesn't make any sense. Over cluttered CGI which can be easily distinguished as fake with no depth in story building 😂😂 Learn from Japan how to make a Godzilla movie 😂
Goku Black is proud to see his son grow powerfull. Frieza is jealous of that monke
ufff men! love this!!!
Hope they explain how Godzilla is able to run😂. Maybe it’s the gravity?
es cine
Oh comon just snap your finger Kong and try to say that your inevitable.
bro kong became thanos💀💀
Seeing them run together looks so mfering goofy bro 🤦‍♂️
I've never watched a trailer to the end of it. But this is gonna be so good ngl I can't wait. OMG!😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
2:27 the punch was giving goosebumps 🌪
😲
Теперь не хватает Даменика торетто
Shimu monster? 🚨
Koba is back!
2:33 is that fkin charlie screaming
Titanus Shimo Appears: 1:53 2:13
King: gomu-gomu no gatling gun!!!!!
Nothing much more fearful compare to Shin Gojira. This two will look like a child infront of him
Wow just next lvl hyped for movie
talk about a bait and switch....you build up all this hype over the scar king, only to nerf him by the 2nd trailer being like "oh yeah, this NEW threat has both kong AND godzilla scared" only to literally show Kong LITERALLY floor the scar king with a punch and knock one of his teeth out....and then introduce this "hidden enemy"
Can’t wait love Godzilla movies but I love the new ones!
I thought Kong was the last of his kind
nah too much CGI or badly CGI'd take a pick
Rest in Peace
King Kong
That weapon is sick!! Is that a kongs spine?
Who’s the enemy is this one just the red Kong or is there another titan ?
Can't wait to see Mothra again.❤
Too much cocaine in just 3 minutes. Can’t imagine the whole movie
okay who is the villain in this movie?
godzilla minus one better
16 million people within 3 days. That's what's called movie baby 😂
I can’t see that run without thinking they’re coming into a wwe match.
😮
When's Mothra returning, tf 🦋
Undefeated Dual 🔥
waiting for the movie...
Godzilla got Thor power
QUERO VER PORRADARIA!!!!!
So is the surprise monster thing Space Godzilla?
Skar King's to to be pissed off after loosing a tooth
Scar King doesn't look like a 400 footer. These YouTubers just be saying anything.
they made cong into a doomfist
Traaaaaaashhhhhhhhh
Bro lost to a skeleton
Godzilla will definitely unlock MUI transformation in the next movie. And Kong will unlock Transformer mode
Bring back Space Godzilla
My hype went high when i see eyes of shimu
They just showed the whole movie in the trailer. Anyway that was epic
Boringggg
Ju realized kong’s beast glove sound effect sounds very similar to the kkvg theme 2:43
To those who may think that there's a slim chance that The Pacific Rim Jeagers & other Titans & Character's of the MonsterVerse, Crimson Typhoon, Cherno Alpha, Striker Eureka, Gipsy Danger, Motha, Rodan, Anguirus, Jet Jaguar, Madison Russell, & maybe another reference to Ghidorah, in Godzilla x Kong The New Empire. Please come in your thoughts here 😎👇
Verey level
0:30 it shows shimo and Godzilla fighting in the city (slow it down all the way)
Gayyyy66yy6yyyyyyyy
So excited for this movie and Kingdom of Planet of the Apes
They should incorporate spectre man he was in a godzilla movie before of godzilla was on an episode
Something trlling me the augmented arm is goin to ruin this for me
why do americans turn everything into an action film
the will fight  another monkey?
Of course the enemy would be a giant chimpanzee. The type of primate that chooses violence more than any other.
garbage movie same plot over and over
I worked in this film. I am going to spoil the ending. Both Kong and Godzilla beat the red ape and save the world, both Kong and Godzilla roar in celebration in beating red ape. Then we got a secret ending that showed a new threat, the camera shifted away from Kong and Godzilla roaring and shifted to the sky then onto space. Then in the far deep space, a White shiny crystal blinks and a distant roar from Godzilla can be heard as if it traveled far into space and onto a large rock with crystals. Then an eye suddenly opened in front of the camera while Godzilla roars can still be heard echoing. The next film is in the making already
Oh.Wow❤
Bet this is gonna have a steaming hot 26% on Rotten Tomatoes lol.
This movie is gonna flop hard af the only reason this even got hype was because of the movie cover with the great ape sitting on throne while kongs and godzillas skull is below him
a big monke use gauntlet
Colabe with pubg😢
2달남았다 딱대라
It's really lame that humans always shoot at G-man. He is actually a protector. When we can understand why not in the movie the very same humans can be any different?!
There is one thing all these monsters can agree on; have there battles specifically right on top of treasured landmarks
can't wait for kang kong in godzilla-busters vs super saiyan rainbow colourfull pink-ish girlzolla😍🔥
I aint gonna lie that tooth hitting several buildings was metal af 2:27 I'm actually so hyped to see Godzilla and Kong tear it up 🔥
Ah... so now we have the girl with telephatic connection with the Kaijus like the Heisei Godzilla and Gamera movies. Not complaining, it's a cliche that came with the Kaiju genre.  Pd: I NEED MOTHRA TO COME BACK! SHE'S INMORTAL SO C'MON!😢.
Okay this is becoming like Transformers now
Godzilla is goku and kong is thanos whos winnning
Zor
0:31 why there is two godzilla over there 🧐
Never thought I would see Godzilla run away from something
Wow blockbuster trailer
Pretty much Gorilla and Lizard vs Orangutan
HEy Marvel... Hey Disney Starwars.  This is how you make a film the real fans AND new fans appreciate!
DUDE!  MUST SEE!!!!!
I like this monsters and new universes, but just keep the same characters from the first movie stop changing up characters.
Stop making these movies
Wow
Can’t wait to watch
They are ruining every Kong Zilla movies now 2016,19 was best
The cgi looks so bad
Waiting🔥🔥🔥

I actually enjoyed this trailer a lot more than any recent full-length Marvel movie.
King Kong is Doomfist?lol
It rate the last scean in ,9/11
It reminds me koba in planet of the apes ....😊😊😊
When are biollante and Destoroyah showing up?
Looks bad
Saint Godzila running like that towards you is terrifying
LESSSSGOOOEEEE‼️‼️
Yooo this is fire they team up????!?! Can't wait

Part 3, Utraman joind the battle rumble.

I think i see Mothra 0:30
10:43 im cant wait!!

Don't bother going to see it. They showed everything in the trailer..
i think that is shimo that attack kong
Ah yes, the latest BBEG, Lanky Kong!
Can't wait it epic 😁 I love both Godzilla and Kong
WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE KONG SOME ARMOUR HES LITERALLY EARTHS PROTECTOR
1:13 penguin0 cameo
Thank you Warner bros Loving your network since Godzilla series sequel if you what I mean😏
This trailor is so sick 3:03
I thought they would become friends outrageous!
Shimu got the frozen beam and godzilla got DA PINK BEAM
❤
2:03 godzilla and kong running together will always give me chills
The next part will be IRON KONG
So stupid 😂
Can't wait for the Pitch Meeting and Critical Drinker videos about this one!
who is shimo?
This looks retarded
I like how they keep giving the big monkey weapons. Love Kong!
“Is that a mini kong?” No ITS curious george
This looks over the top! Not in a fun way but in a cringe CW way! No thanks
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
why always kong attracts towards a girl why not a boy
Why TF does Godzilla screams like Penguinz0
Ik this day would come
Day
1:13 Bro sounds like a MoistCritical
Its kinda funny how Godzilla went from politely ducking under bridges in 2014 to just straight up bulldozing through them now, lol!  EDIT 2/19/2024: Holy crapola!! I wasn't expecting my comment to get this much attention!!! :D
wait so it seems the big bad guy now is not really the red kong, there's something else...
MONKE
So Godzilla has the lightning powers and Kong just has a power gauntlet honestly something I expected
Wow amazing
Finally a official approved trailer
Godzilla being nerfed again💀
Oh, we''ve gotta be getting Space Godzilla. Which would be -- so awesome.
I am *SO* ready for this.
ハリウッド版のゴジラも好きで全部観てるから楽しみだぜ！
As much as this is a Godzilla and King Kong thing, I’m getting some weird Primal Rage vibes from this. Or is that just me?
2:26 - 2:27 Pause here quickly and you'll see shimu at skar king's right
Kong is actually just doomfist from overwatch in a different timeline 😂
just give me some giant monsters and i'm chillin
Warner please get a picture of shimo where sad abaut that
2014 fans are not happy rn
Yeeeehhhh this is itttt 😮😮😮😮😮😮
looks like another little girl saves all the men flopper
Backup 🔱
Let's NOT kid ourselves...It's NO Godzilla Minus 1...it's a couple of hrs of off the wall, off the top rope craziness...
何回やってもヒューマンドラマ。怪獣映画を理解して欲しい。スクリーンで観ることは無い。
Them movies today trying just way too
2:26 Godzilla  become Super Saiyan 😂😂   And  next Godzilla become  ultra instinct!!!😂😂  Godzilla become Goku😂😂  1 tags team match   2 Godzilla become Ronaldo 😂  3 Godzilla become  ultra instinct super Saiyan blue god   And Rose   and  next power boost. Lighting Blue 😂    4   . I love the way king Kong see  the power of Godzilla 🗿 he eye  kong tell everything how terrible  Godzilla is🗿  Is kong don't the weapon   kong is dead  🗿
Who let them cook THIS much?!
They all got upgraded.. Holly..
They may not be the greatest movies, but I'll be the first to say the fights are always exciting to watch.
Hopefully there's a new monster. I was hoping they would bring back other monsters like Gigan or the aliens.
This is the best rendition of a 5 year old smashing his toys together I have ever seen in a movie franchise, its amazing.
They used to be scary.  Now, its like TRANSFORMERS in flesh...
Long Live The King....
suko will be epic here
Kong: U.S; Godzilla: Japan. Of course they are gonna make "hero" Kong win against "villain" Godzilla.
Oh! we have almost shown everything to audience lets make something trash
Good 🎉
Can't wait
I like it awesome to see this trailer
Let them fight.... together
Ah!!! TRAILER IS EPIC!!
YES!! GODZILLA AND KONG WORKING TOGETHER!!
Nice
Rise together or fall ALONE!
TRAILER 2 IS CRAZY!!! GODZILLA EVOLVED VS SHIMO!!!! OMG!!! CRAZY!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Go!!!! GODZILLA!!!
Why can't hollywood get its mitts off of Kemet, ancient Egypt? Why must there be CGI Pyramids in a CGI desert every action fantasy movie?
Kinda weird that in mostly every movie it has the number 13 in it could be just a coincidence or something idk 🤷🏽
Müll
2 Godzillas
🦖🦍🦋 vs 🦧
Kong want that run back after this with his infinity gauntlet lol
:o
The king and the god will always be the best duo ever.
from Godzilla v Kong to Godzilla x Kong. very beautiful
I actually thought that Cyber Woo was going pop out when I saw that hand in the beginning. Damn shame.
Ayo i swear i saw shimu
Mantap nih
Is everyone just ignoring how terrible the CGI looks??
Who saw tooth?
When a gorilla and a lizard start a fight in the zoo, and a producer with a director comes in and see the potential in that fight and they decide to make them movie stars, then the movie comes out where they fight with an orangutan. 🦖x🦍vs🦧 😂
This movie is going to be 🔥 just like the other ones
does anyone else hear the Charlie woooooo scream
Looks freaking good
When will this trash stop!?
I see they added Planet of the Apes
Amazing reminds me of Pacific Rim or something lmao this looks like one of the all time best ads for a movie!! So exciting!!
a must watch for me
Junk food cinema at its best
Out of all the humans from the previous movies they could have brought, it had to be the fat black guy and the bland female scientist
oh wow..😮
Hyped loved loved Godzilla vs King Kong. Got to say I’m excited
Big Monke and lizard vs big Monke and lizard
I'm not really a fan of these types of films but this hypes me up i might see it
HOLLYWOOD, just when I thought. You couldn’t get any Co Co Co Cornier! 🫵🏽🤣🤣🤣
Now is 8:17
Kong said I'm bout that action something is disturbing me let me go down there and see wtf going on 🦍💪🏿
this is ridiculous. but that's what makes it so amazing
Following the steps of the Fast and Furious saga I see
Ridiculous........ Yes I know it's a movie but even "if" a Gorilla got really big it would never get as big as they make Kong or Godzilla for that matter. Maybe a bit more realism in our make believe movies.
At least i'm 100% certain this won't be as bad as Madame Webb.
Trash of the year?
They gave kong a power fist from fallout same colour and everything 🤺
First movie the humans were kind of annoying...more so the kids.  I hope she isn't.  And what's with actresses and short hair these movie days?  Brie Larson/Wasp/this? dafq.
Another little girl gonna “save the world”. The human story in these movies are terrible. At least it’s not that untalented stranger things chick.
Who is the end big bad boss in this one?
Someone tell me the damn timeline
I much preferred the more grounded world of the first Godzilla movie in this series over the generic CGI monster summer blockbuster slop.
Best movie in 78 countries gonna call it
Release the Minecraft movie please😢
Ojalá no se parezca a Godzilla Minusválido 😒
They keep milking Godzilla until it becomes Fast and Boring
😂 the other one bombed.. Godzilla Minus One made by thr Japanese that cost $15 million was EPIC.. now they copying them 😂😂
What utter garbage. Godzilla Minus 1 cannot be topped.
Well hello theme from KKvsG at 2:43 !!
Why now I need to make an choose
Ok I guess its time for Kong x Transformers because im pretty sure Bumblebee is on his arm.
They have turned Godzilla atomic breath to pink, for the “gender neutral“ crowd.  🌈 👎
Time to watch big monke and the radioactive lizard fight buffed up orangutan and a Godzilla rip off.
Omggg Im fkng sick of the little girl character somehow being relevant in a movie about kaijus. American movies are so shameful its not even funny. I can just tell how one note and exposition heavy all these "characters" will be yet again.
How can anyone think this looks good 🤣 this gonna make Godzilla 2000 look like a masterpiece
These movies have jumped the shark, then turned around and triple-backflipped an orca.
Cant wait for godzilla and kong to fight evil godzilla and evil kong
I feel like I saw the whole movie with this trailer
The actress in it suggests this is all gonna be in her head and theres gonna be a twist ending haha
look how they've massacred my boy....pure garbage coming out of Hollywood
🤣
Two godzilla movies in one year!! Oh im hyped
The world needs Kong
That team up moment when the both ran towards something TOGETHER was bada$$$$$$$$$
Lightning Godzilla, pink death ray Godzilla, this'll be fun
Gtfo of here hahaha. Our beloved monsters have become Marvel heroes.
holy frick dude this movie gonna be epic
Lankey Kong!?!?!?
This looks so stupid.
Why did CGI get worse ?  Is a question millions are asking ...
Godzilla is literally MoistCritical
These are getting a little out of hand.
Monster movies are just one of those things that no matter how old you get, you still get giddy over seeing giant behemoths duke it out and do crazy roars/power attacks.
KONGZILLAAA........is..........BACKKKK..........2.0
I remembered "Fine....I will do it myself..." moment!!!
Super excited :)
i wonder if anyone notice godzilla and kong opposite are scar and shimo. atomic vs cryo and power vs agility
The worst part about this movie is that there is no reference for size during that scene with all the other apes. Theyre supposed to be big but look like regular cgi apes
Another super-hero movie looking like the 648 super-hero movies we had before
Theyre really doing good in following the trends. Kong now has a new infinity gauntlet, totally never seen before in the MCU, and godzilla is gonna be broly
NAH SHIMO IS SICK
Those pesky kitty cats are trying to take over the world again!
Im sorry marvel move aside. Gordzilla and Kong have been there for me the past few years and I'm here for it
Bro Kong is a savage he punched scar king in the face and made his tooth fall out
it would be cool if they high fived at some point, like some buddy cop film lol!
Hey Disney this is called entertainment as we know you're forgotten the meaning because of your awful constant woke messaging...
This is gonna be f***ing EPIC. Y’all think the End Game for Monsterverse is gonna be Kong and his people and Godzilla and his allies face of Destroya?
OK OK., this movie has everything. More Jurassic Park Dino noises than you can shake a stick at, a transformers style trailer and feel, NES power glove, Kaiju, giant ground and sky lasers and war for the planet of the apes......but I'm sure it still wont wont win an Oscar
Crazy how this might be the first movie yet in the universe (and one of the few, if even that, out of the entire Godzilla franchise) where we will have recurring characters as the main protagonists   I know the dad was in King of Monsters and Godzilla v Kong, but he barely was in the second
So there is a monster another than scar king after all…
The visuals look terrific, but the story, characters and pacing are going to be absolute dogshit. The dialogue is also terrible. “The last time those two met up, it was almost the end of Kong” feels like an AI written line. I’m done with the MonsterVerse. Japanese Godzilla movies will always be better. Hollywood needs to take notes from Godzilla Minus One.
Let's go 😲🤩
This Is To much ❤  kong you are amazing...
Seriously the people aspect to these movies are garbage and take away from the movies!!!! Just give us the monsters!!!!
AN DEY SAY
Ive seen better computer graphics on a zx 81 computer. . Hollywood,,, officially has run out of ideas.
Its the MCU all over again, but instead of superheroes we got giant kaiju. Could be worse.
This looks absurd
Thank you for the movie I watched well 🙂
RIP Bumblebee🪦
Brasil!!
By defeating the Scar King that's how Kong gains the title King Kong
if ur making a giant monster film pls this time dont make humans the main character
I can’t wait to see this!!!!
Wow
The guy who searched Godzilla x kong today: Oh wow, look at this new movie, it looks incredible! The guy who searched Godzilla x kong 5 months ago: I HAVE SEEN UNSPEAKABLE THINGS.
Looks like king scar is a villain and judging by kongs face their is something else he looks scared of almost like another godzilla with the eyes
2.5/5
Godzilla can change his color and he can do atomic plules and kong had a boxing glove so his had is stronger THIS IS MOVIEMIS GONANA BE SICK BRUH
WOW this looks sooooooooooo bad
At 1:56 could be shimu
Dawg this looks terrible 😭 Edit: saw it today, it was actually a lot better than I thought lol
We all know who the villain gonna be in the 3rd one.here’s a hint curious
Ofcourse it must be the pyramids LOL
harika yaa
Most Waiting ❤❤❤
They really used Charlie's "WOOO YEAH BABY" sound in the music 💀
Other Kaijus : Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan, Destroyah, Biollante,   Monsterverse : Let's make Kong again
The monsterverse and Tom cruise are the best selling and most enjoyable shows to watch for years now.... please no more barbie things... im here for Oppenheimer though
It's like watching those ultraman shows again :D
So what monster/kaiju can shoot Ice  1:51 and 2:10
Why is every trailer edited like this?. Slow down. Film looks poor.
I live and breath for this movie
Looks spectacular although it hits differently after watching Godzilla Minus One
Godzilla is the best though but most people think Kong is the best.
So no one gonna talk bout the fact that they just showed Shimu??
Excited
"Godzilla x Kong" why not simply "Kongzilla"?
AMK BOKUNU CIKARDINIZ ARRTIK TRANSLETE TURKISH ENGILISH
Well...i feel like i just watched 25% of the movie with this trailer. Pretty much confirmed there's a 2nd villain.
I'm tired.
Looks like it's going to be a hit movie
I cant way for the move and for its monsters like mothra godzilla kong scar king and suko and doug and maybe cylla frome king of the monsters!
İyi
Pov:Quantas você já Assistiu Eu:Claro
God i hate these movies
Godzilla with pink spike on his back COOL and Kong and Mini Kong and different Brown Kong with deadly weapon also different creature with icy power
2:27 shimu to the right
1:53  Godzilla:   ….mom?
I been waiting on this since 96' when i was born ❤
I put money on it, that other titan their fighting is shimo. Look em up if you don’t know
If anything happens to baby kong I’ll have no faith left in the movie industry
Just wish they got rid of the humans in these movies or had them as a backdrop , like I don't care lol . Unless you can make it like Godzilla minus one which Hollywood can't
2:41 lol omg it’s beast warss baby
No deck
Hold on in the trailer. We see pink godzilla and a blue one. I wonder ia there's two gojiras, our one from previous movies and the new one from this movie
Shimonoseki
just give the license back to Toho. this is embarrassing
I love how the apes know karate
Some Marvel level CGI. Planet of the apes only franchise to do it right
nice
con toda la plata que se fumaron creando esta pelotudez se podria haber comprado comida para todos los argentinos que estan muriendo de hambre gracias al presidente que votaron.
0:01 lol starting instantly out with that generic trailer sounds too classic
Level ❤🇵🇰
2:27 FATALITY!
THE HYPE IS INSANE‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
2:47 bro throws buildings
Oh ts finna be good good
Yo that’s CRAZYY. This orangutan really using a massive spinal cord as a weapon. That’s SAVAGE RUTHLESS
This is perfect background to fall a sleep
what do u all think is coming out at 1:53 ?.. i only see 2 eyes in fire..any guesses please?
This is just too dumb, Kong and GodZilla teaming up like some Starsky and Hutch, duo. These films are loosing it.
They showed everything in the trailer
As always this is going to be epic!!!
YYYEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awwww
Why is it so confusing to me?. Kong Godzilla team up against the Reddy but then there's a scene where Godzilla's against them and Godzilla is killing humans again. Then there a team. It's like what's going on
This is really a whole new level of ridiculousness.
March 29 thats jy birthday
Ice Rays!!
I AM SO HYPED FOR THIS MOVIE
I love this, idk how I feel about Godzilla running that fast with how big he is but man this is gonna be legendary
🦠
Omg
GOOSEBUMPS
Does anyone thinks that the "MonsterVerse" will last for another 5-9 years after the yet to be announced season 2 of "Monarch: Legacy of Monsters" of which it's pretty likely to happen?
YO THIS LOOKS SICKKK!! f the haters
Did Disney make this movie?
I hope we get more straight white men in this movie.
Godzilla fears nothing it beat Ghidorah the most powerful titan of them all.
Godzilla's gone full showa and I'm not complaining, if you want a serious Godzilla watch shin Godzilla or Godzilla minus 1
Wait.... at the end was Mothra??!?!?!?!?!?!
Type in comments for coyote vs acme
i can see godzilla los waith on 2:40
bro 2:38 got me when another ape got hit in the head
going cinema DRUNK team KONG
Cool👍👍👍💙💙💙💙VOTE BLUE HI MOM! 🤗🤗🤗💙💙💙💙
YESSSSS!!!
This movie looks trash af
Kong learned and mastered the Falcon Punch, Godzilla unlocked super saiyan Rose, and now they gonna be like Randy Orton and John Cena having a bit of a rivalry while tag teaming on a big threat let’s gooo.
Just getting more stoopid as it goes
Stop showing us the whole movie in trailers
Look, it's Kong and Diddy Kong.....
Rise of the planet of apes. Literally.
Ok I'm interested
Feels like Pacific Rim 2 . Can't feel the weight of these monsters anymore
I have a feeling invader zim, jimmy neutron and he man are all gonna make appearances in some of these trashy installments of kongvgodzilla that have no substance
cant wait to not go see that in the cinema
This will at least be better than the steaming pile they gave us in Monarch
Kong with his gauntlet and the battle axe(if he uses it) and Godzilla with his new forms are gonna be epic/crazy to watch.
So.... whos the villain?
When will they bring Destroyah out?
Is it only me who thinks Godzilla is getting smaller in size movie by movie😅
It’s all… so much … garbage. Monkies and dinosaurs in metaverse action using sophisticated staff weaponry and gauntlets in space and in underground molten caverns full of unrealistic, lost empires of monkey intelligence opposition.     And a lot of this battling takes place on casual civilian earth where they basically destroy large portions of manmade structures in big cities with their fighting and killing tons of people beneath them but since it’s a movie, that aspect of the battling should be blind to us……  It’s a movie. I know. But it’s just too fuckn much.   I just got off work, made a quick meal and hung out before bed and it’s funny I was literally watching the 2005 King Kong. How tf do we go from that to this?.   Different title , sure. But still how do you nab a creature from this universe and throw him into this scy fy, almost avengers type mix?    Some people will actually think this is cool.
The more destruction, the trashier the plot. I miss king ghidora...
CGI nya kurang mateng pas kong dan godzila lari bareng
Надеюсь, что Казахи оперативно его сольют.
After Godzilla - 1, I can't take this seriously
I can’t tell if movie is gonna be cringe or not. It’s turning all superhero avengers now
*SHIMO IS QUEEN!!~*
what kind of metal is able to hold its shape and flexible at the size of kong's fist moving at that speed lol....gauntlet...if humanity can make that they might as well make mecha godzilla 2x the original size and dominate titans
I don’t understand one thing: are there two Godzillas? blue and pink?
Godzilla gonna show shimu who's the KING here
Go Kong!
Go Godzilla!!
I just say make a PRIMAL RAGE movie already 😆
So Gooo!!
Trailer 2 is epic!!
omggggg
Thanos hand metal glouse gifted to kingkong
Rio de Janeiro will end like San Francisco hahaha
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
So is there like 2 Godzillas???
Kong going to score big this time
We all k Godzilla solos Kong though bro is undetectable in that new form
This man Godzilla looks undefeatedable in that new form bro looks OP
Goosebumps ❤
The CG looks like a PS4 video game. They should’ve used AI for more realism. 😅
1:25 Mothra?
YEAAAAAH❤❤❤
King Kong was first appeared in 1933 and Godzilla first appeared in 1954...
ёб твою мать, сколько же можно снять говна? и на это же ещё и пойдут в кинотеатры
Dafuq did I just watch. This is some high level shonen plot
Talk about over the top
So who is vallain?
แค่ตัวอย่าง3วัน15ล้านวิว😱😱
godzilllla got blacck gokkupower😂
And this appeals to you people because? 😂
Its been a very very long time that i have said wow to a Movie coming out!  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So I’m just beside myself thinking Bumblebee was about to be unearthed in this trailer?  Okay.
They fighting Koba?
My Spinal is ready!
I literally enjoyed "Monarch" series it tells alot about this monsters and from were they came this looks similar to it and I'm down bad for it , can't believe I'm enjoying monster Verse more than today's Marvel.
This is so epic that Godzilla lost weight
Godzilla's head is still way way way way...WAY too small....he looks ridiculous in the full body shots... surely something could have been altered. The close ups are amazing but as soon as it pans out to show his entire body.... his head disappears and we see this little dot on top of this massive creature.... I keep hoping they will fix it since they keep changing everything else but I guess some dip rod in a suit thinks this is the best look?  Imagine a T Rex running around with a skull the size of a human. That's basically what they keep doing to Godzilla...smh
What a dream it would monster verse x transformers 💀💀 not the marvel
Scar King is just taking orders from Shimu. Kong and Scar King have 2 fights, King loses the 1st, wins the 2nd, needs Godzilla to beat Shimu, and that’s a wrap.
am goin monkee
ayo my man is goku black's ancestor
😁😁😁😁😆😆😆😆
Warner Bros we need u to get doug in the movie bro please we need jim
Upcoming masterpiece of 2024 !
There should be a Godzilla and Kong movie in the future where a scientist takes both the DNA's of Kong and Godzilla, by experimenting and creating a hybrid titan that can kill and destroy all mankind even Kong and Godzilla where they both don't stand a chance on beating the hybrid titan.  But however there can be one who can defeat the hybrid titan whose been locked away and unused for over 50 years by two Japanese engineers who created this machine who fought alongside with Godzilla 50 years ago. This machine is no other than....Jet Jaga  (Jet Jaguar).  That would be cool to see in theaters.
godzilla runs now. We've come far.
I'll tell my kids this is a reincarnation of 2012 the movie when the world was to end
this is gonna be epic
the screams are like that of titan drillman from skibidi multiverse
I don’t care how old I am, I’ll always get excited for this!
Im expecting next video to be the mincraft movie trailer
I think we all know exactly how cheesy and predictable this is going to be but we're still going to watch it anyway so whatever 🤷🏽
Zero and Sanji
Next movie with transformers please!
2:31 wait so we bringing back thermo but blue?
I don't even care if Charlie Sheen appears in this movie i'm still watching it.
Can't wait amazing
Fck It... LETS GO!!!!
Who's the villain?
I don't care how stupid this series might get in future. I'm a simple guy and I want to experience seeing some unimaginable, planet size, giant primal creatures fight each other or work together in a realistic setting. Cause I won't ever have chance to see something like that in real life.
It would be great if godzilla & kong vs cloverfield monster, or cthulhu from underwater
Let go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
little ape throwing rocks😂😂
Big boom make me go wow!
bro kong punch that spider monkey and a tooth came out like iron man punched hulk a lost a tooth in rise of lotaron
why I hear moistcr1tical every moment
It looks ridiculous and stupid!!!     I love it!
🔥🔥
This looks so over the top. I absolutely love it.
Their running together is still funny! 😂 Их совместный бег – это всё равно смешно! 😂
The movie nobody ask for or wanted , yet here we are
👀👀
Oh great, another film about family drama while monkey (but big) is fighting in the background.
in this section 00:31 they are fighting near Santos Dumont airport Rio de Janeiro, go to Google maps and see
Thought i watching another tralier for the new plant planet of the apes for a minute
Already lame sauce when the women says that Godzilla is afraid of something lol. Dude, Godzilla will fight GOD if he could find him lol
So when do the merge the video game series Rampage into this?
2:03 Side by side that's what we love to see. Kong 💜
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:32 Godzilla: “NOW I AM SERIOUS!” *Goes Super Saiyan* 🔵 2:45 Kong: “This does puts a smile on my face, The infinity Gauntlet” 🟤 2:53 Godzilla & Kong:
At this point this has become weird, very weird.
Yes yes yes yes 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thanos: "You damn, dirty..."  (Godzilla stomps Thanos into Looney Tunes pancake)
Look at da signs N symbology
This looks so goofy 😂 I love it
If It's have a Crossover Including Pacific Rim will have the battle Between Giant Monsters and Giant Robots will joins Forces
Who’s grinning from ear to ear?😂😂
WHO IS THE ANTAGONIST?????????????
Is this directed by Michael Bay??
This looks good
Starring Mel Gibson as Kong and Danny Glover as Godzilla.  This is looking to be the best buddy cop monsterverse yet lol. But in all seriousness I look forward to this movie.
What kind of trailer is this.. full of blast and beat sound..  Tired of these over CGI Godzilla movies with Kong.
Fardu trailer ❤❤❤
They kinda spoiled the whole movie but I’m still excited to see it
King Kong with the Furious power fist from Fallout 4? Sign me up
Can we throw away the forced DEI mandates ? Thanks.
I love how they can now sprint
Shimo
The new Hobbs and Shaw looks great
When they make big monsters dance around like power rangers or the Jaegers from Pacific Rim 2, it really takes away any sense of size or weight from them. It just... breaks immersion.
He is rising to KING kong now
"they don't have to like each other, they just need to work together" not with these friendship vibes again 😭😭😭  the enemy of my enemy is my friend ahh lines  TOGETHER WE ARE TITANS!!!
If you watch the clip from 2:25 to 2:27 and look CLOSELY at the road next to the beach, where Scar King is roaring (On the top right) you can notice something running on the road
Now that's some trailer🔥🥵
Still here waiting for a remake of the Son Of Kong the same way Jackson remade the 1933 King Kong, because its great
SHIMU to all the Titans: YOWAI MO 🗿
Was worried Kong forgot the bionical ubgrade
he won't be alone !!!  I GOT CHILLS !!!
oh a fearless 120 pound women who thinks she runs things. yawn. thanks for nothing hollywood.
TLDR: bum bum…kong and godzilla…bum bum bum…big bad is coming…bum bum bum…big monster fight…human says funny thing…BUM BUM BUM!
When is the movie coming
I'm just tired of the cgi sometimes. I feel like it's not subtle enough anymore and breaks immersion.
Trailer is awesome 🎉 So what will the movie be like ?
Anyone gonna talk about how kong punched the scars off of skar king 😂😂 but geez that was insane
the scene where they ran out of a hole together was just jaw dropping
#23 di Trending 14.919.102 x ditonton  3 hari yang lalu   14.919.102 x ditonton  15 Feb 2024
Shimu is backkkkk
Heck yeah 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think it is the transformers crossover
Crazy
I'm surprised human in Godzilla universe still decides to live on Earth
In last movie both were kind of assuming themselves strongest but.........ENTRY OF SHIMU GAVE BOTH OF THEM CHILLS AND THRILLS ❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️
THE KING... ALWAYS WINS!! He ain't scared of NO BODY!!!
“For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.  Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.” John 3:16-18
Looks ridiculous....i can't wait!
Will the film be shown in Egyptian cinemas at that time?
America has created havoc in the entire world and is trying to establish itself as a saint through films. America supported the murder of the one whom they worshiped. Israel who murdered children and children and the Americans who supported them.
Godzilla x kong, but more Kong scenes again in screen :(
Godzilla Minus One still better and this movie isn’t even out yet.
i don't even care if it doesn't have a story, i will be happy if the action is mind blowing.
Egypt ❤🇪🇬
This looks absolutely ridiculous and silly…and I can’t WAIT TO WATCH IT! 😂🎉
Not sure how I'm going to feel about this movie after watching Godzilla Minus One. Probably an epic fight that I'll forget about 3 weeks later.
I wouldn't be surprise if in future they collaborate kong and godzilla with transformer
❌save the broken building that full of people  ✅ bunch it and look cool
Take my money now.
If I HAVE to complain about anything, is the COLOR of my uncle's glow. It has ALWAYS been neon green or RED and NEVER friggin PURPLE. He's Godzilla, NOT Samuel L Jackson.
"they don't have to like each other they just have to work together" truer words spoken
This looks like absolute dogshit. The visual effects are laughable
Man I really wish they find a way to make to do a crossover with the Pacific Rim universe
Kong riding Godzilla when ??
2 kongs  2 titans  This will be the best movie in the monster verse so far
I'm sorry but these are just getting worse
Movie looks dope. But when we getting ultra man in this universe?
I WANT A MOTHRA COMEBACK!!!
Godzilla is just a DBZ transformation.His atomic breath is the Kamehameha
Man,thats dope
I am from India I am so excited Godzilla x Kong movie ❤❤
This is like "Son of Godzilla" meets "Godzilla vs. Megalon" and I am SO PSYCHED for it!
OH KING PULLED UP TO HIS CRIB SOLO FOR A 1 ON 1 THATS gangsta💯😈💪🏽
No mames que fuerte wey yo soy unos de los mas grandes fanáticos de godzilla e visto desde la película de 1954 asta 2021 y la serie del monsterves e visto todas las películas de godzilla incluso las de toho y legendari y está cuarta entrega no me la perderé será épica
Godzila better than kong😅
wait was that a second godzilla?
Kong will fight to scar and the Godzilla will destroy scars pet dragon
i'm lost here. I have seen only a few movies of godzilla and kong, does this have some plot continuity?? or i can just watch this film
Stupid Q but where did the titans come from?? Like who’s the OG first known titan to exist
Telugu trailer please
This looks absolutely terrible. Just like the one before this.. and the kong skull island. And every Godzilla film. Only good film of any of these was Peter Jackson’s King Kong
2:50 *+PARRY*
I'm laughing here, because they've spent millions of what is nothing more than a B- movie, only with more elaborate bells and whistles.            It needs more cowbell.
Why does that one sound effect sound like moist criticals scream??
I thought that was Optimus primal
Wth humans gonna understand every godzilla family when bombed with neuclear weapons gets more power because they absorbe that energy.... so dont bomb it? +__=
Stop raising money with the same story
This Is gonna be PEAKK
Barney the Border Collie is going to lose it over this one.
I am godzilla fan
Looks so stupid. And I love it
Awesome
This looks dumb af. Probably going to be fun, probably going to enjoy it, might even go see it twice. However, compared to the earlier Godzilla's and especially Godzilla Minus One (Japan), this looks dumb af.
Don't tell me godzilla ain't finna be the most powerful in this movie, he already looks like a "GOD" and y'all finna have him acting like an ELDERGOD
Don't tell me godzilla ain't finna be the most powerful in this movie, he already looks like a "GOD" and y'all finna have him acting like an ELDERGOD
It's fun to watch how bats#!t crazy fun things can get when politics and agenda aren't shoved in you face.  I hope this movie does well!
I just like monsters, my inner child will take over me again with this one.
Seeing this is IMAX 3D would be mind blowing!
that ice breath... is that shimo??
I can’t control my CHILLS for this one
Please for the love of God please put mothra in this movie🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
The GODzilla
Epic ! 🤩🤯👍🏻
CANT WAIT!!!
saan kaya aabot ang story nito haha..papuntang planet Apes
Last boss is Vin Diesel with all of his family. Not even plot armor can win this one
Im just curious, Why Is every movie have black characters?
Is that a red ape? Or beast titan? 😅
I wonder how many culturally ret***ed Americans are gonna br calling this film "Godzilla Ex Kong" 😂  It's "cross".
So they’re fighting an evil version of themselves?
I wouldn't mind much more films like this with epic CGI and big monsters fighting with each other. I'm just simple man.
Looks like WWE monster show.
IN THIS MOVIE WE NEED GODZILLA'S BREATH AND SHIMOS BREATH CLASHING
Absolutely booooorrrrriiiiinnnnnnggggg 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
Just delete the king and zilla running scene....that's all❤
❤
Godzilla x Kong: The New Infinity Saga.
The trailer just showed too much brah...
Skar king reminds me of Beast Titan
They got Zilla out here doing the   get off me  anime style energy blast 2:33
They got no chill mardo Bhai mardo sab tordo itna bridges road repair hone mai bohot time lagta hai
Watching this premier in Stockholm the 27th of March! 🔥

I still can’t get over the fact that Kong has the infinity gauntlet and Godzilla managed to unlock super saiyan rose💀😭😭😭
Yo bring optimus prime for the next film
Wow!

Makes sense they are going underground  Another one of these movies and there’ll be no countries left to destroy in the final fight scenes 😂
This movie looks retarded, but fun.

Spoiler alert!!!!!      That tooth that comes out is Godzillas tooth lol , they combined the 2 scenes together
1:50 Kong meets Shimo
The Bros are back 😂
Bu mal kızı filme niye ekliyorlar amk
Any time I see ‘x’ in between names I think back to when I was looking through certain comics where it was name x name. So imagine my shock when I see Godzilla x King Kong
1:35 Kong meets Skar King
The woo🤩
Godzilla Minus One is still better than
At least the fighting is happening in daylight😂
Hahahhah finally the end is near 🩸🩸🩸😈😈😈😈😈
dang, tony stark is alive - dude, the gauntlet even transformed like an iron man armor :D
In future Kong and Godzilla fuse:The next battle. 😂
Didn't knew Godzilla can change gender
Damn, that’s SICK 🔥
Kong=Lebron, Skar King=KD, Godzilla=Zion, Shimo=Giannis?
It is much easier to understand christopher nolan movie than this trailer
What is this marvel now?
Best trailer in the universe😊😊😊
😂😂
Godzilla 🖤_🖤
Amazing 😢
finally a movie i’m excited to go and see
O M G !!! Literally can’t wait for this master piece to drops Sheesh 🙄 🎉🎉

In the end we see villain is laying down and Godzilla ana king kong standing movie so in the trailer we see full movie already 😅
Oh gosh can't wait man
❤ the movie sound and graphics goosebumps ❤
Got a bad feeling about this movie not gonna lie.   I feel like they tried to over do it and it backfired
What would Thomas the tank engine say?
Tamil fans assemble
So this is it huh, we are some kind of justice league!
Wow 😮
I don’t know. That looked ridiculous. 🙄 so much cgi that looked very much like cgi…
I miss movie like 1998 Godzilla🥲
D A M N !! THE TRAILER IS INSANE 🔥
Now that's a trailer!🔥
First Thor's hammer 🔨   seconds the infinity Gauntlet,  What's next an iron man suit 😅
Omg 😮😮😮😮😮❤❤

GODZILLA IS A GIRL NOW?
Doomfist got a new cinematic 😮
This is how you make a trailer amazing 100/100
Good trailer, great film! I will wait
This looks like garbage, wish they kept the same atmosphere as 2014 godzilla. Easily the best one
Who ready want to trailer 2!?
I don’t care what the wife think I am gotta go see this shesh in theater 😮
I might be out of the loop but can someone explain how Godzilla has gone from blue to that pink color?
Godzilla and Fortnite = Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire  <3
Wow, can't wait for the mayhem to begin 🤩
Godzilla fans like here
Just realized how good the monster cinematic universe is compared to DC
Почему не 2074 год?
2:29 - Ford Focus, Jeep Renegade and a Chevrolet Cobalt. Nice job
That's was just awesome 😎
Kong becomes one punch kong

Si ponen la velocidad de x0.25 en el minuto 2:27 se puede ver la cara de  shimo
I am tired of waiting blood pumping love godzilla
Looks like a B movie
I dont need anymore godzilla vs kong. its enough!!!!!!!!!!!
When I see trailers like this it makes me wish The Writer's Strike was still happening.
why am I not excited for this after watching Minus 1?
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
1:17 The new Aopoa San’tok.yai looks great! Even if its 900 years early!
The contrast between this and Minus One is hilarious
Oh my god it looks so good!!
😮😮😮Manki so danjar lik me😮😮
BS!
Gave me chills!
My favourite scene is scar King throwing a building to kong and I also like that teeth scene ❤❤❤❤❤
lets go! Godzilla is better than King Kong though.
I  LOVED THIS TRAILER MORE THAN TRAILER 1 , BECAUSE WE LESS SEE pink GODZILLA
Epic
The  story telling was very boared at this franchise... 🥲
TeamGodzilla
Can't wait for watching whole colourful and drastic destroyer King Kong❤
Looks lame.
Damn!!!😅
Silly AF but omg this looks awesome
A Biggest Blockbuster
DAAMN JEEEZ!
time to go back to monke
Wherever there's a biggest screen in India, I would want to be there to experience this masterpiece.... ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Nice, looking forward to seeing it 😁 But why does Godzilla have an ice breath instead of his atomic breath? Is it some kind of "Frostzilla" or different version of him? 🤔
Shimo🦖❄
Next hollywood idea, Kong would be in the Iron Man suite.
No not King Kong and Godzilla is almost a Marvel monster 😂
why does suko sound like hogrider
Start to end only goosebumps 😮
Banger 🔥
Pass
Watch...these dam humans are gonna get more screen time and yall wasting yall mulah. Holllywood films are effing garbage like always 😂
No matter how bad the plot is. But I'm definitly going to watch for Kaijuu battle.
who observed Prabhas puch... 😊❤
Now kong & Godzilla are friends think in the end trailer he was defeated scar king & shimu
I'm officially old. This clip is embarrassingly stupid.
2:52 Friendship goals
i don't know why ,but this will be the best trailer i seen in 2024  or it's just maybe i watched it in 2160p
THIS IS GONNA BE HUGE
Can someone tell me how Godzilla achieved Super Sayian Rose?!?!
That yelling sound that keeps playing in the background reminds me of a slightly distorted moistcr1tikal's "wooooo"  "Yeah Baby! That’s what I’ve been waiting for!"
I can't wait 😂
W
I can't wait to see this Fire new movie and I'm hoping to see another collaboration Godzilla x Kong with Pubg Mobile!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
wheres pacific rim robot?
well,time for party!
2:27 made me laugh he got knocked tf out 💀💀💀😭
Larinya godzilla aneh.
7 VECES TENGO VIENDO EL TRAILER👊😎
I'm still waiting for memes about Godzilla and Kong's running together
Thermo godzilla is back😮
This lowkey brings me back to the silly godzilla movie days and im honestly here for it
0:30 who is fighting with godzilla on the right Is it shimu ?
I thought it was transformers for a second
Too much CGI has made these films cartoonish. I miss the old rubber suit films, they somehow seemed more realistic.
Wow
This is 1.000% better than latest Marvels movies
Wow
What is it with you guys why do you want to destroy our Pyramids anyways we will protect our Pyramids that our ancestors have built from anyone even if it was Gozilla or Kong 💪💪😂😂
Thanks I have now seen 75% of the movie 😂
രാജാവ് kong മോനു
is this prequel? then who is the many skeletom on the first movie?? ?
Oddly enough this franchise has taken a page from Fast and Furious...starting strong and somewhat believable to down-right ridiculous and terrible.
These producers milking the f out of this...
I can't wait to experience this in 3d
How would you multiply them???
Great! They had to upgrade Kong to his beginning faze of iron man
I am yotubar ❤️❤️mere chanal se aapki help ho sati hsi
Kong got the infinity gauntlet and godzilla can sprint. What am i even watching
Ridiculous but cool
I WILL BE HERE!!!
I'm not a fan of the monster verse but these recent movies are getting my attention.
Fireeeeeeeee
It's gorgeous! 🌩️🇧🇩🇵🇰
Theres another godzilla?
My Japanese wife thinks this movie is trash. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 That’s NOT Godzilla in her eyes.
I think this is shimu right ?
planet of apes ceaser speaking so if kong speak like ceaser  it will shock everyone
I think Kongs iron hand made of the same hollow earth energy punch as mechaGodzilla🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks very, very bad
Never forget Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) or the first Godzilla (2014).   This is an abomination.
Dear Hollywood, please try some new sound effects. The sound design in this trailer is the most relentless, unimaginative sequence of stock drum hits, stabs, smashes and sword slices I have heard to date. There aren't even any swords in the film! I've finished what I was going to say but I still need sign out by going DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! ...DUM! ...DUM! DUM! ...DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM!!!!!!! DUM! ...DUM! ...DUM! ...DUM!!!  DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! DUM! ...DUM! DUM! ...DUM!!!!!!!!!!!
Dammmm
2:13 I can barely see shimu over there
OH MY GOD
What are those little bugs
Was that shimu 1:57
Too much VFX and CGI and blue light animation is kind of boring now a days... this thriller is going above my head
fff yeaaaahhhhh
Love it .
Best movie full action full adventure
Next movie, godzilla x kong x pacific rim
Why pink it is not cool, purple is better
Is this out now I can't wait lol
OMG A NEW THERMO GODZILLA BUT IN BLUE😍😍😍😍🥰🥰
1 number yeh Khushi
Wish the best for Kong and Godzilla. I'm sure they'll give the cinematic experience their fans will be looking for.
Super saiyan rose
you can take a great look at shimo not that much just top of the of her back fighting godzilla and scar king fighting kong but the thing about that kong have a great hit shot but sometimes he miss and losting axe does not look like kong can one godzilla same when they met in the sea when kong hits godzilla looks like kong can knock out scar king
Wow, part of this film takes place in Brazil, specifically at Christ the Redeemer
Kong first got the Stormbreaker, and now the Infinity Gauntlet. Godzilla turned blue, orange and now he is pink. Crazy stuff seeing in The New Empire, it is going to be cool with Kong and Godzilla vs Scar King and Shimu.
AUTOBOTS ROLE OUT
This is a banger and i know a banger
A duo that even I don’t want to see
Will Shimo willl be there 🤔
Hope they bring mothra back
In Godzilla movie look at Godzilla speed and check the speeed of Godzilla in this movie.
Call of duty warzone be like let's do it again Me to COD - why don't you just stop your cringe away
Finally shimu show up😢
Gokudzilla Rose and Thanos Kong
I'm impressed ✌✌✌❤❤❤
Entaliya.... myr saanam💀💀💀
wow godzilla❤❤❤
Who thought the franchise would take this big of a turn.
What was he sayin? last time when they both met it wasn't almost the end of Kong it would've been the end of Godzilla. Kong saved it😂.even though being Godzilla fanboy he must not claim it ridiculously. The only time Godzilla was over Kong is on the ship.
Let them fight ❤❤❤
Rgb Godzilla 😂😂😂
Full fan material 🎉
Beginning Of New Era..
Pretty realistic
0:31 shimo fighting godzilla frame
Running out of original content...
HO LEE SHEET
Bro that godzilla is literally running.
Finally cgi fighting thing
It was shimo I'm a Idiot is that why godzilla under went a new evolution
Why VFX so bad..  in some scenes where Godzilla and Kong are shown together, they look like small figures.. Depth in those scenes is not realistic to portrait them as giants as thats what they are.
Is it just me or do I hear penguinz0 in the background
👎👎👎👎
Good thing that the camera man survived
SUPERB
There’s two godzillas?🤔
Non ha senso che una lucertola che sputa ghiaccio sia più forte di una bomba atomica che cammina
Is it reached the target audience . . . Men~ *YES*
Lol in next movie they will attach big di$do to king kong? 😮😅😂
❤
imagine a post credit scene wherein kentaro from the monarch series reaching out to a transformation object hence a tease for ultraman in the next movie whole theater would loose there mind! 🤯
Looks sooo bad 😂😂😂😂
Next summer, please make a movie entitled  Kingkong vs Barbie
Very interest
What next a 750 meter crocodile 😅
sub zero is the enemy
Godzilla and Kong teaming up is like when your two friends who never get along suddenly decide to do a group project together. You're just waiting for the chaos to ensue, but somehow they're actually pulling it off, and it's kind of epic.🦍🔥🦖 #TagTeamGoals
DOMB
ohhhh yeaahhhh.....BOOM..💥
It looks like a live action Saturday morning cartoon, and I am here for it.
1:51 So Guys Finally shimu is Confirmed.🎉🎉❤❤
That freaking icre breath,  Its freaking Shimu.
I saw a hint of ice on kongs axe so theres a chance that a snow godzilla might appear
Magnífico
Gonkila
godizila oh my boy ...😈super saiyan rose the infinty god power 🔱
GOOSEBUMPS!!!
Kong has the power fist
Presiento que la historia será mala pero con buenos efectos
GOOSEBUMPS!!!
GOOSEBUMPS!!!
Who else loves that Godzillas always looks ANGRY⁉️⁉️⁉️
I can only hear MoistCritikal from those sound waves lol
This is getting crazy
godzillas pulse sounds like charlie going "WHOOOOO"
First comment: If king scar is old then he must be just past his middle age in titans years otherwise he wouldn't be able to take on kong. 2 comment: anyone think that king scar seem to be full of rage when he saw kong for the first time? Because it look to me like that. 3 comment: godzilla won't be fighting king scar for 2 reasons.. 1 if godzilla defeat king scar then he must lead the kong group which will make no sense.. 2 this is kong chance to prove that that he is the king of hollow earth. Godzilla prove he is the alpha of all titans. So kong will prove that he is the king of his kinds.
godzilla x kong new ship?
Its about to become like the Fast and Furious Franchise 😂
Looks like kong been watching avengers
It's like the gvk trailers, they're not trying to hide Shimo in the trailer. Heck she even looks bigger than the G man himself.
please tell me the movie ends with kong snapping his fingers and saying "And I.... Am Monkeh!"
"Apes together strong!" XD
0:30 mothra?!
Cool idea but these movies are getting a bit out of hand now. Godzilla King of the monsters was the last good movie
Short haired female boss woman: check Disabled ethnic prodigy girl: check. 😂😂😂
No way we got kong and godzilla on the same team before GTA 6 😭
Need to watch this on cinema with a fcking popcorn and a mask of kong..
is it just me or they just sneak in monsterverse the planet of the apes plot??? thank god for japaneses monsters movies
Will Indian regional languages trailer come?
Welp another call of duty bundle I guess because this film is using a call of duty font💀
Will Telugu trailer come?
I don’t normally like monster movies. But I might give this a shot
Can’t wait
I’m so excited the fight between Kong and skar king looks so epic and shimo is so cool looking
Monster verse movies are now becoming like Marvel and DC movies.
🎉
bad cgi
People: its silly Me: i dont care 🤩🤩
I like how almost every action franchise inevitably spirals into the Fast & Furious trope to always go "bigger" and "bolder". There's a direct correlation between time elapsed, and silliness.
I am waiting for an instalment in which Kong and Godzilla mate and there's this new titan called Kongzilla.. Freaking Bollocks.. 😂
🦍🦧😱
What is this marvel dogsh#t
Mini Kong like my pup
so basically the monster verse has taken the route that the superhero marvel verse did. another cgi visual attack
Its crazy how they try so hard to stiff that human subplot down our throats just to make it more grounded lmao..
Wr already know they defeated the villain in the last clip. Good movie.
This is gonna be insane!!!! I’ve waited years 👏👏👏👏. People who complain this is ridiculous, it’s monster movies!! It’s Godzilla and Kong, duh but it’s super fun to watch. Get outta ya head and enjoy! I freaking can’t wait!! Fan of Godzilla since I was a kid, in the 80’s watching the cheesy ones lol.
Damn!
This looks so stupid. Can you imagine the pitch. ….  Now this time we give the monkey a metal punching glove.
nice now we got multi coloured godzilla
godzila and kong awesome and together power smash me waiting for this movie
Amazing
Not team monkey. Team Godzilla here. To many woke B lack’s already
Just oh my god 😮
Ja tou mo ansioso kakakakaka Como saímos de 2014 pra essa maravilha  quero assistir isso na estreia
what have they done
So who’s the bad guy
MOTHRA!!!! DID YOU SEE MOTHRA IN THE YOUNG GIRLS EYES ????? SHES BACK!!! QUEEN OF THE MONSTERSSSSS!!!
SÓ FALTA O CRISTO REDENTOR GANHAR VIDA E LUTAR TBM
👌
Can't wait to watch..i remember 30 years ago king kong was released in Bangalore HAL theatre..
Sheesh
im so exited for dis moive
Full plot in one trailer 😂
Pure രോമാഞ്ചം 🥹💥
king kong si buff😂
2 Godzilla 2 kong in the movie 😲😲
Now if apple would just hurry up with the now Monarch: legacy of monsters season I would be happy
29 marhc its my birtday🎉🎉🎉
WE GOIN BACK TO SHOWA ERA SILLYNESS WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥
Think so two Godzilla will appear in last fight...... Run the video in .25X speed and check at 30sec to 40sec and u will find PINK GODZILLA and SHIMO will fight in the corner and SKAR KING will be attacking other Titan in middle which explodes a electric shock.....think so that blue electric Godzilla will appear in last fight....🎉🎉
I'm guessing this is the Kong Trailer. Not much Godzilla here.
katanya kutu film film itu ada mothra
If I had a nickel for everytime Kong and Godzilla are forced to work together, I'd have two nickels which isn't a lot but it's wierd it happened twice.
Main enemy???😢
1:50 kong be like:  wtf, why always a lizard 😢
Yo that’s CRAZYY. This orangutan really using a massive spinal cord as a weapon. That’s SAVAGE RUTHLESS
skull king got a pet godzilla
What would US cinema do without the funny one dimensional black dude????
…Family 🚗 🚙…
Just feed them both Taco Bell and call it a day.
Awesoe i can not wait for it to come out
Theres so much cgi it looks like a game trailer.
The real goosebumps
Let's be real: the one titan they should fear is destroyah.  The humans used the oxygen destroyer in the second film so now we are ready to unleash the demon destroyah.
I got bored watching just  half of the trailer
When this movie telecast😅
This looks like they put the worst aspects of Michael Bay and Marvel movies together and inserted them into the directionless mess that is the Legendary Monsterverse  😬
yas-fitness0029
Story looks bad. Action looks awesome. Godzilla minus one got me wishing for both again 😫
This is gonna be One of the movie of all time
This trailer makes me excited.
Who's the villain 😏?
That ✊ PUNCH 🔥
Excellent ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Stop making the same movie over and over. Think of something creative and meaningful.
Just keep the unnecessary human dialogue out of the movie so it doesn’t ruin it 😊
Love you KONG
Not the pyramids again!
I cant wait to watch this in cinema
Anyone else hear the moistcritical woooooo 😂😂😂
How many kongs  are there
What disapoints me is always the lack of weight, like they are big af and still move faster than me when I try to get up of bed
Cook dawg cook
We need this on pubg+bgmi 😍
Love how most of the “fans” here are just praising Minus One while ignoring the director of the movie loved this movie too. Real Godzilla and kaiju fans are happy there are two cakes to eat.
This will be fun.
Oh mon Dieu puissant 😮
I’m tired of seeing Brian Henry in these movies. He adds nothing.
but is that blue "godzilla" always godzilla in another new version like after the magenta or is it Shimu?
I don't know man they're doing too much :/
Love it
Really excited for this. This looks like it's going to be epic.
Lol we have shimu:)
Egypt 🇪🇬 ❤
vaya mierda de peli cada vez peor
why are you guys making godzilla smaller and smaller day by day ??
This Godzilla not end this war
Has anyone else noticed the fact that scar king injured kong's left hand and shimo blasted Kong's left hand yet the 'infinity gauntlet' is in his right hand!!!
🎉
it looks like PS game from 2012
น่าสนใจมาก Godzilla Kong
What problem does Titans, Giants, Monsters, and Decepticons have with PYRAMIDS ?? hahahahahahhaa...
Letss go we got shimu
pls traier movie lego 3 final piece 😢
The is going to be epic watching it on a Apple Vision Pro
This is going to be like a total birthday present. This and "Civil War" It's great being a march baby
It will be flop.... Mark my words
なんかキングオブモンスターズと作風が違うなぁ
Just shut up and take my money!!
There like 100s of Kong's which is bs cause for the longest time king kong was the last one his kind
They literally show the whole movie in this trailer
Here we go Gayzilla🔥
The only reason why aliens haven't attacked us yet because even they are afraid of the mighty Godzilla and Kong
Godzilla got a goofy ahh run💀
Do people actually want to see this?
Makes me want to watch Minus One again.
I have the same feeling that i felt with  Godzilla II - Roi des Monstres  ==> this one, in my opinion, was the best movie of gozilla verse ! the epicness, the monsters, the screens , everything was epicful.
This is the worst Godzilla film I've ever seen.....
God it's cringe
🙄😑
So wtf would I go watch it now when you are literally showing me everything?
Attakasam a iruku
Spoiler alert! this going to be 2v2 fight Godzilla and Kong vs shimu(like Godzilla but ice version) and the orange ape
wait is that godzila at 2:31 or someone else?
Yes!! New sh for PointlessHub
Bali and sugriv fighting together 😮😮
why is godzilla brue is he sopose to be majenta?
Kong యువసేన assemble here❤
Do you wanna know how I know that this movie is going to be garbage? There's women talking in the trailer.
If the enemy is going to be King Ghidorah again... They have had to buff him to oblivion if he is to fight against Kong and Godzilla. Shame that Ghidorah was beaten by Godzilla ON HIS OWN a couple times
J
waste of money waste of time waste of energy is full filled here
This is gonna be great movie i cant wait
😮😮😮😮
Skarking is stoled scp 682s woise
A drag a chillam kong goes on and on and on 🤣😂😀
“You feel like going for a ride?”
Who's the  Enemy?        Oh man!, I hate Spoilers!? 😆 🤣 😂
2 great powers battling in the real world - it’s not just a movie but ehh let’s watch
I wish they'd get their sense of scale back, they don't look as big and menacing like kotm or the 2024 Godzilla film
I wish the movie to be 7 hours ❤  Anyone ?
fun fact is that lizard have also beaten kong in hand to hand combat
🔥
KONG JR
Fake
400 likes😮😮
in 1:53 is that godzilla or a new species or a new enemy godzilla bruh thats so sick asf
If you watched this without special effects then you'd be seeing 1.5 hours of green screen.
so excited...seeing the showa era coming back...aka my childhood
This movie sure has to win the movie of the year cos wtf😮  I can't wait to fast forward time to march 29😂
i think its 2v2
Super saiyan rose fo zilla and a gauntlet for kong how epic
Бред
God damn!!! that looked awesome can't wait!!!
Why do CGI in 2024 still look like video games
if you told me that a godzilla movie released in 2014 would lead to a epic teamup between him and an infinity gauntlet wielding kong 10 years later, I wouldnt be surprised coz that sounds entirely plausible
I know the storyline will be dissapointing but whatever. I will watch it for sure!
Godzilla losed some weight. I mean Godzilla literally runs as the same speed of Kong ☠️
0:31 shimo🐉
I’m so stoked! Finally all caught up except for monarch series. Cannot wait to see this!
Kong& Godzilla fans assemble
Фига Москвичи разбушевались.
I'm excited 😍
I,m so hyped
Togeather they will demolish them ●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●
what are they fighting against?
i would rather watch godzilla minus one again, hollywood is such a disappointment
0:31 look closer you can see that four of them is fighting
2:00 Goosebumps❤❤
Kong one of the baddest titans
It was kinda good ngl
Can't wait to see Godzilla and Kong in the red carpet premiere together!
I wish they have kept Bear McCreary for the music.
why do i not like this?
1:27 really liked the penguinz0 scream there 🤣
Shimu has come.......
Gommala Veri thanam 😎😎
I hear one word about bleach in this movie, I'm done.
Sooo am I tripping or it seems like it's gonna be Scar King and Godzilla vs Kong and Godzilla
Bee est passé par là....😅😅😅
Transformers
And your really gonna tell me they fit this in just a 1 hour 58 minute movie
now the monkey has a whip? thats not supposed to happen!☠☠
我想念我的摩斯拉
THE NEW TRANSFORMERS SHOULDVE LOOKED LIKE THIS
ARE YOU REAAAAAADDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY!!!!!!
Shimu
Im excited to see shimo:)
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is going to be epic 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Как уже надоело в американских фильмах что только негры и геи. Что людей нет?
More diverse woke junk 👎 ….Japan’s Godzilla Minus one IS way better
This is gonna be soo epiccccccccc let's goooooo🔥
This looks dope af 🔥🔥
why do these dumb people make the move in the dark ... we cant see Godzilla nor Kong
NERF KONG
They rlly wanna get the hype up and it works as always edit: i also think the blue version of godzillas thermo version should be called supernuclear godzilla
Going to be a great sequel Godzilla vs Kong 2 the new empire  coming out in cinemas March 28th in Australia and march 29th in USA going to have more great action sequences for Godzilla vs Kong 2 the new empire
What’s so special about a red orangutang?
Подрались
Something is coming. It doesn't get more generic.
Godzilla is the G.O.A.T no 🧢 Fun fact: there's Mothra's reflection in the eye of the girl around 00:29 to 00:30 seconds in the video no 🧢
Cant wait to see kong and godzilla working togueter
2:05 Godzilla looks like Barbzilla😂
Dear Producer,  I have just a simple question, in your every movie, you depict Godzila as a villain and Kong as a protector to the human civilization. Why this is so? Why you always portray Godzila as villain?? Any solid reason?
Looks like planet of the apes now

Did somebody notice there two godzilla blue and rose.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
To me, it feels like there’s something lost when these huge creatures seem to manage to move way faster than they seem they should be able to. Some of the momentum and gravity of their movements and attacks gets lost. Maybe that’s me watching though.
There was great, but i saw eye have Mothra, Kong vs Shimu, Godzilla vs Kong, Godzilla vs Shimu, Kong vs Scar King punch the Scar King teeth, Godzilla electric and Suko kill another Kong.
Epik Or more than tgat 🥵🥵🥵🥵
This is never for the theater.......
This looks dumb ngl
I think Nxt movies ...Godzila/Kong vs planet of apps
yooo, i just saw shimo when kong and mini kong punch scar king
Is this movie follow the storyline of monarch the legacy of monster series or not
Soo EPIC!!!
Something about Skar Kings lanky frame is quite unsettling.
Everybody gangsta untill they see, king kong with infinity gonlet😅
Bro this movie deserves oscar
Shin zilla ?
cant wait.
🎉yeskong😮
fire
Godzilla x Kong x Planet of the apes Let's go...
Will they keep making annual Kong/Godzilla movies now ?
❤
augmentation = turning kong to ma dong seok
With this trailer, I can tell that this movie is going to be really... Really stupid BUT WE G-FANS LIKE IT THAT WAY! THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS!
❤❤
❤❤❤
Not bad
This is like cartoon now
Why are the military attacking Godzilla YET AGAIN ?? Are they retarded.
king kong x godzilla a new beginning 💙
Let's goooo!

Super hero movies are dead and monster verse is taking over
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am you tube My you tube channel 😊😅😮😢😢
Omg shimu is coming confirmed
Here we GO!
I want jaegers
I'm calling it now, 2.06 is going to be the most recapped part in this trailer.
Does anyone else not notice scar king on top of the foothill in Brazil watching Shimo frost blast the sky ?
This Kong & Zilla duo is lit!!! 🔥🔥🔥 Hope to see Mothra next time 🥰😍
Stop making these dumb Azz Movies
Jangan jadikan godzilla villain
This looks so stupid wow.
not going to see this
Hindi main release karne ka man nahi hai kya tumhara jo do din ke baad bhi Hindi trailer nahi nikala hai
Coming ❤ soon 🔜 Most popular movie 🎥
❤
現実離れし過ぎない方が良かったな。 何かトランスフォーマーみたい😅
Team kong 🥺❤💥
It will be a film of the year ❤
Gyaattttttt🤝
Kong’s face when he saw Shimo was straight up fear! Like wtf they want me to do w that thing?!
ㅅㅅ
OMG
Collecting subscribers 1/100❤
So Thanos eventually returned to monke.
Egypt at the moment :
W ❤
The idea of a Kong Warlord is such an awesome idea!
is that 2 godzillas?
OP.
God this looks terrible!
What's this Shimu everyone keeps talking about?
That's a big tooth!
Pubg me fir se Collab ho  ga 🤯
Gosbumps 😮😮
So, this is a 3 hour movie condensed into 3 minutes. Doesn't leave much to the imagination.
KONG GOT INFINITY GAUNTLET AND GODZILLA GOT THANOS COLOUR 😂😅
What about Gozilla & Augmented Kong against The avengers ??
I hope we can one day get Jet Jaguar
Boring
The real villain is shemo  Means this movie will go on another level.
This is retarded beyond measure.
I like how warner bros doesn't care about writing and makes more silly monsterverse movies each time and we the audience don't care about it because we just want to see big monsters fighting lol
La Brea and kongzilla
500 subscribers complete 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Excellent making
MOTHRA HAS BEEN CONFIRMED!!!!!!!
Never watched a Kong x Godzilla movie but this one has caught my attention 🤔. See y’all in the theaters next month😂
I miss the 2014 Godzilla movie i don't Why but it's not giving that much vibes
STOP MAKING 3 MINUTE LONG TRAILERS THAT SHOW 95% OF THE MOVIE. FFS.
Obviously I love Kong.. but Godzilla is the King of monsters…
There is such a thing as too much CGI imo
why does godzilla scream sound exactly as moist critical screaming???  coincidence??
Ham to hindi mein mangta hai 😎😎
🔥💥
wtf is this man
This looks so bad
komみたいな天変地異を揺るがす戦いが見たい 期待してるぜハリウッド
God this is beyond pathetic
This movie is inspiration of comics
2030, kong will have full iron man armor and godzilla fly to space
Think the should introduce on next one all the other titans stories then have a much larger battle going on
Gave me the chills just now 🤔 Thinking about Kong and Godzilla Teaming up 🔥😮‍💨Let’s Go 👏🏾👏🏾
Hindi
Monster verse Kong and Godzilla, with some Pacific Rim and Planet Of The Apes thrown in there for good measure. To describe this as "Big" seems like an understatement, so it will certainly be interesting to see what it turns out like.
Looks like movie companies are milking the Godzilla franchise. Like this is now so overrated and boring bro, do something new.😂
开始变超级赛亚人了。。。。
Godzilla scream kinda reminds me when Tyler scream
waaaat
The original trailer was better
this feels like fast and furious vibe.... its getting ridicolus in sequels
Sheesh who y’all got bois super saiyan rose godzilla or super saiyan blue shimo
Is Shimu there in this.
I get the feeling that Godzilla and Kong will shake hands in the end of the movie just like Godzilla with Jet Jaguar back in the 1970's
¿Por qué pienso que esta película será una reverenda cagada? ¡Ah, sí! ¡Lo pienso por qué hay tanto CGI! Aguante las películas de Godzilla japonesas, o Gojira, cómo le dicen ellos.
Sheeeeeeshhhhhhh
Syk beam, Nice.
Kong supremacy
So very nice video
Why
This would be amazing
Looks fun.
is this palworld movie?
Yea I don't know how humans are still a thing
These movies are becoming the Fast/Micheal Bay Transformers of monster movies 😂
imagine watching this being over 15 years old. Go se a doctor, you have development issues.
I’m so excited I grew up with Godzilla and WB has something good here keep up the good work we need the G-Man and Kong in our lives.
Pass...
Yall gotta answer millions of question...godzilla is king
Just saw the whole movie in 3 minutes lol
Too cartoony for me, but kids will love it.
What happened to her hair?
Waiting for the day Gigan arrives
so, basically, Kong is bucky now
Really? 😂😂😂😂
First Lebron joining Golden state now Godzilla and Kong on the same team 2024 is getting weird I miss the 80s😮😮😮😮
Release on my birthday 😍
Practically watched the whole movie right here
Hopefully it's not another story about some human drama while Kong X Godzilla is sidelined as background characters.
Опять тупой американский фильм
Ah yes, some more of the classic Serizawa Let them fight action.
Sorry, but this looks dumb
So, that's the reason America soldier stayed for so long in Afghanistan
I feel so bad for the enslaved kongs. Skull King is evil
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES....!!!!!!! TAKE MY MONEY
I want to see both of them in a buddy cop film in the 90's style....just for the Luz!!!!!
Wow ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥💕💓🥰
Oh my god, very amazing
am i insane or am i hearing the moistkritical "WHOOO" sound in the trailer?
Godzilla and Kong doing the Avengers' hero run! 2:04
Cant wait for the Michael Bay version of Godzilla and Kong
😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
I love it 😍. More Kong , more Godzilla yeahhhh🎉🎉🎉🎉
bro ! Ain't no one gonna talk bout mothra coming back!!! 3:03
After this, please no more Godzilla and Kong crossovers. Bring back more original Godzilla monsters and let him keep his spotlight.
So kong got thanos' gauntlet
Kong and Godzilla: bickering The New Empire: shows up Kong: Truce? Godzilla: Yep Truce
Feels like Pacific Rim 2 . Can't feel the weight of these monsters anymore😂

Now all we need is Gypsy Danger to come out the wood work and then this will be complete.
I thought I was watching a transformers movie for a sec
Felt like showed a little too much in this trailer.
Uff🤌🤌🔥🔥🔥🔥
They're still missing the point, I thought King of the Monsters should've shown that these stories shouldn't be viewed from this action spectacle, but like a disaster movie. It can be action sure but size doesn't matter if it becomes a simple spectacle action movie that just happens to have Kong and Godzilla. This is Pacific Rim 2 all over again
They really did give Kong his own Infinity Gauntlet. 🤣🤣🤣
That's it. I'm sold  Shut up and take my money
Anyone gonna talk about how godzilla sounds like penguinz0 just pitch up a bit and amplified at 2:33
So when’s pacific rim 3?
Godzilla Kong Rise Together
Biollante soon...
Where is millie?? 🙂🤍
Shimu is real!!!
HYPED HYPED HYPED
Please never stop making Godzilla and Kong movie... Me and my family are huge fan of them 🩷
From Kong vs Godzilla to Kong And Godzilla,  We've come too far ❤️
The Lion King stays home
Except for the ganked up running scene, it looks great.
When buddy cop movie meets monster movie meets Planet of the Apes meets Transformers, lol. SMH... Thank God for Minus One.
JAB YEH ANIMALS EK HO SAKTE HAI TO HAM HINDU MUSLIM Kyu nhi🙂🥲
Cool!
I will drag my girlfriend to this and she will be powerless to stop me.
One of the greatest trailer i ever watched
that last shot of kong and godzilla is wallpaper material
-Конг не справиться один -Он не будет один!
You guys sure know how to get these stupid people to watch something utterly ridiculous!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Once again, annoying human characters throwing unfunny and unnecessary marvel style comedic dialogues.
0:48 Shadow of King Ghidorah or two long shadows 😮😮😮
cant wait to see the actual main characters get sidelined for some human drama...cos thats why we are all here.
am I crazy for thinking space godzilla or Shimo might be in this??? that blast that hit kongs axe and the one from the ocean view appears to be ice or crystals. Anyone else?
Team Godzilla 👇
W-was that Mothra in the other scene?...
Ohhhhhh I can’t wait for that!
how did cgi get so much better but also so much shittier
great another diversity hire movie... CANT WAIT
I'll watch it, but man they're just not good movies.
Godzilla got nerfed.... he could esaily defeat all those gigant primates and evem shimu by his own... he just need to charge up with enough nuclear energy.
Damn curious george grew up but without the man in the yellow hat around
Cartoon movie, 😂 ,hollywood kid movie
Godzilla and Kong are now buddy-cops
Godzilla in the planet of the apes
godzilla turned into hesei godzilla
Is this like a parody trailer? This is the dumbest idea for a monster movie ever.
Yeah, this is gonna go hard
Godzilla has ape arms now
Shimu confirmed?
1:42 that's duraaaaant!!!
Op
only ultraman can beat this godzilla kong teamup
Dafuq? The new mighty villain is a skinny orang utan?
1:13 is totally that meme sound
Godzilla ain't afraid of shite ...
This is the movie I’ve been waiting for 🔥
The new thermal is cool and if you can see it I sort it leaves a pattern on the ground or it produces a pattern on the ground where it’s charged and it looks like it’s tad bit lightning-ish get again volcanoes can produce lightning with Ash enough heat but can’t say for sure why is it again humans aka us using drone strikes
oh this is gonna be bad huh
This is looking epic.
Superb
I think the villain would be a wolf
Pure goosebumps 🔥
クソ映画に成り下がったな。
why CGI getting poor every year?
Deadpool and Wolverine will be a great matchup against Zilla nad Kong
NO MORE KING KONG OR GODZILLA!!!
I understand that the trailer looks crazy amazing but I feel like it’s exposing too much hidden stuff in the film. WAY TOO many people complaining for a second trailer and now here it is, exposing so much where most of it could be in the film. I feel like great films/film franchises should have only one trailer to keep people very excited and hyped for the movie.
Power full movie 😮
I watch the movie first day first so 🎉
GOD LEVEL
i mean, they have one of the Eternals with them...even if he is only the tech guy.
WB congratultion next level movie kcpd
I am waiting for the ultimate movie ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ofcourse there another bigger dude
I will be there
"GET BACK HERE SHOCKER" "SHOCKEEERRR!" "YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME, I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARRRTHH!"  Scar King to Kong probably
Pass
Visual treat 100%🎉
Nothing change it feels d same giggle always like kids 😂😂
Boooooooring. Minus 1 instead.
Tranformers X godzilla X planet of the apes X kong
Godzilla and kong working together before GTA VI? this boutta get litty🗣️🔥
All i need is kong or godzilla to give the optimus prime speech at the end..we must come together to rebuild a better future
1:54 Shimu😮😮😮
DIDDY KONG!!!
😮😮
Shimo and its roar is all throughout the trailer 🔥
Goku black in Godzilla 👀💀
Is that shimu😮
0:51 best
Kong has the glove of Thanos, Godzilla acquired the power stone, some new enemy got hold of the tesseract (probably wrung out from Loki), again Doctor Strange messed with the multiverse and Marvel burst into the universe of Kong and Godza!
The pink godzilla is gojirin suppose to be female godzilla but good way to wipe her out the storyline
boreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
Kong fans like here ❤
Godzilla minus one (2023)
Cod zombies lore:
yall ruined what godzilla was meant to be. Where is the story?!!! a fukin moneky beating a mokey. whats next, mothera comes back? pft. let toho do godzilla you go back to justice luge and tellytubies
Kong is the new Shocker, he is better than marvels Shocker.
They don't miss! This franchise has been killing it
Somehow we've gotten more technologically advanced and yet our CGI has gotten progressively worse.
So there is shimu
In the end of the movie kong will be the villain in the next movie
Vote for trailer 3 👇
Has nothing on Godzilla minus 1.
Kong studied the mad titan
Who is beside the
We want Hindi trailer
Long live KongZilla!!🙏
Super Saiyan Rose Godzilla x Thanos Kong....
u know its gonna be good when godzilla goes super saiyan rose
Saint Godzila running like that towards you is terrifying
im hyped but this villain is he just kong but faster and more agile?
WOW! Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is going to be Amazing! And I can't wait to watch this film!
Nice video except
So they're gonna be fighting back the rise of the planet of the apes? Bring back Destroyah or Gigan pleeease
What in the "GET OVER HERE!!"?!
looks like more of the same
People can complain about this movie all they want but im so fuking ready for it!!!
*Boooring.....*                    *-Homer Simpson*
Who’s their main enemy on this film?
Oh god please let it be the last one
🔥
Will this movie be released in 3D
Kukira bakal ada fusyon haha
King Kong the famous creature and yes everyone's favourite. He even appeared in Transfomers too XD. King Kong really getting so famous.
My gosh bro im hyped seeing shimo
Bro, this is the new planet of apes. Are lit 🔥
Godzilla has literally no right to be afraid when he can OBLITERATE every single Kong like creature in that cave. 💀💀💀 and it looks like that’s exactly what Kong needs him for
The universe has called upon us. LETS GO DUDE!
Bumbs on goose
LIKE
I would rather pay to watch King Kong (2005) & Godzilla (2014) ..
I love Legendary they actually add the new and the old and honor the old Legendary is badass in glad they add woke content in there movies aswell Respect Legendary U haters
Q MIERDA ES ESTO.
That was the most trailery trailer thats ever trailered the trailerverse. *boom noise*
Kong Thanos Without infinity stones
Is this a joke??
I want to see Godzilla flying across the screen doing a drop kick
gotta be the one on the first premiere
Damn im just now noticed Godzilla taking a shot at Kong. I guess they fight again after upgrading this movie is gonna be awesone
Nah bro that punch kong gave scar king was personal 😂😂
Theres something about Godzilla running with that body structure that doesnt sit right in my brain. I mean, the distribution of wieght, imagine any creature with it's weight sitting on its hind legs, running with that speed. The bio-physics is not adding up.  Also, Godzilla can run all this time. Mtwwh (hisses)
Is Godzilla pink or blue? Blue Godzilla gets me to the theater, pink Godzilla can wait for streaming.
Dankey Kang > Godzilla > King Kong
I want to know why just in the last few years, godzilla is a *thing* again.   Why?
komedy movie
This is starting to get rediculous at this point.
why godzilla's back is pink
P.U.N.C.H.  Primal's Ultimate Nonstop Crushing Hit  ;b Of the big gauntlet on Kong.
Is there gonna be 2 Godzilla?
From dark semi-horror movie to colorful action movie
There's an Icy Godzilla as well as the pink Godzilla as far as I can tell. The Icy Godzilla attacks Kong with his frostbeam
2:27 pause and shimo reveals
0:30
Godzilla x Pacific Rim crossover PLEEEEEASE 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Day CGI is amazing, great work !!!!!!!!!
Thanokong
Hopefully zilla fan boys are less toxic than in last movie
This movie looks like HOT, maggot infused garbage compared to Godzilla Minus One...
Team Skar King and Shimo👇
Team Godzilla and Kong 👇
Outstanding WB❤❤❤❤❤
what a trailer
Excellent.  I will definitely love it
So Kong turning into a War Machine? 2:43
Y'know it's actually not that bad
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes crossover could've been insane.
Pues o sea apostar que si te vayas por fui
Eliminar suerte Tepizuac dejaste Wings el Always Like Our bupivacaína cachái quién es Erika si fuiste García Fike Ender

Oh the trailer.. Of The Goofy Running, Godzilla is finally here ✨
Looks promising...
😂😂😂😂😂😂
They have blue thermonuclear godzilla😂
Can anguiurs be in the new movie in the final battle
I hope it doesn't end here, it's gotta end with Destoroyah.
Woah btw the new villan seems to be a little malnutritioned ,legenday flims please give him some food😅
This looks awesome! But stop giving everything away in the trailers😂
No way they gave Kong the infinity gauntlet! That’s tough!
OH may gote ggftu
“The titans were the guardians of nature” she said as godzilla just recklessly destroyed two bridges and very likely killed people
2:44  I am invincible
super saiyan rose and thanos will win
Doesn’t feed right, those huge monsters are too fast ! Other Godzilla movies were better, they nailed it !
Why does suko look so human
Goosebumps
This looks like absolute trash. I'm in.
They showed to much
Hi! John ling,🤗🥰😁
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎊🎊🎊🎊🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 i am a Godzilla and Kong fan 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 I am very happy I am waiting for March 29
We need to support movies like this.
Marana masss 🔥🔥🔥🔥 waiting laye veri aagradhey
tf happened to this franchise 😂
Yo I haven’t been this hyped for a movie in years
well thats so much for a trailer
Omfg… stop doing those films… even the trailers are the same…
Ima need for the black fat guy to play a different character. In every movie you play i bruh same purpose tf
0:18 is cool to me
Please make the transformers come into kong and godzillas universe
Well they finally confirmed that Godzilla did win in the last movie😂
zoon it will happen in reallity🤣
It's going to be an epic fight between Kong and scarking I could hardly wait
Notice the title says "godzilla x kong" and not "godzilal vs king" does that means they will be buddies
I may seem delusional, but I think that the "13:13" on jias vision, represent or tell when the trailer three is going to realese, the first 3 represent march, and the 13 is the day, like "3-13". I may sound stupid, but well see
If you go to 2:27 you can see scar king was holding suko (mini kong)
Yeahhhhhhh Im watching this for sure
🥵🙅
I lov3 it
HINDI LANGUAGE MODE AVAILABLE OR NOT ??
big monkey punch big monkey. perfect
Kong with infinity gauntlet and Godzilla ssj rose vs curious George and disabled dinosaur
Comes out on my birthday, wow!
This Kong is a monster Kong, 10 times the size of the 2005 version
Haven't been a huge fan of the characters in any of these recent western takes. Hopefully this one does better in that regard, but I'm not holding my breath.
Monsterverse at its peak
we need godzilla vs destroyah next that would be legendary
oh yall are that cruel
1:25 el dui
Looks sooo dumb.   The film makers should all watch Godzilla Minus One and take notes.
0:30 -- MOTHRA?!! [ In Jia's eye ]
A new kong vs godzilla and another planet of the apes. Probably going to be the best thing all year. Cant wait
Dear Warner Bros. STOP spoiling the movie in the trailers!!! The first trailer was perfect. This is just too much!
Yes yes yes yes yes
Why does king kong have a gauntlet and not some giant sawed off shotgun or giant gatling gun
Blockbuster ❤
Someday I think Kong would get a power like Godzilla
Cant wait to watch
Notice that scar king damaged kongs left hand but the gauntlet is on kongs right hand, i wonder if godzilla destroys his right hand
I SEE SHIMO it's so big
This looks so awesome
why they shot godzilla 2:32
Kong.... .. ❤
We have a mini kong  now where is  mini godzilla
God jeez this movie is about to be the best movie of all the kaijus movies I even seen
I love the monsterverse so phuckin much   The hype I felt at the beginning of the mcu is here   Mcu lost its spark
I usually only watch critically acclaimed movies because I don't want to waste my time, but I'm all up for another round of big, mind-numbingly dumb, action involving Lizard and Monke doing nothing but duke it out in glorious unreal CGI set pieces. I'm tired of being fed politics and irrelevant messages in every movie and TV today, we need movies to be fun and dumb again.
I'm hyped. but. I mean. It's not the same as being a kid and discovering Godzilla, watching the "suitmation". Different movies, different generations and what not. But still hyped.
1:15 ambatakuuuuuum
Whooo like kongggg please like ❤❤
After watching Godzilla minus one. This looks fast and furious goofy 😂
Bellingham was doing his celebration when the fight was going on😂😂
2:32 they brought back his nuclear plus from the heisei era millennium era and kotm at this point the monsterverse is being coming less like the Showa era and more like the heisei era
everyone wants to look forward to the Godzilla vs Shimu fight but I want to see the Godzilla vs Scar king fight. I want to see Scar king use a bone weapon to whip Godzilla Lmao  😂😂
i want gundam x kong movie
All I can say about this trailer is that wingerd cooked
What a trailer
💀...... That's just insane
this movie better be atleast 2.5 hours long, theyve not been able to tell a story the last two movies because its so short and it makes it boring plus action scenes
This looks fun as heck, I might go see this one.
Well I just watched the whole movie from this trailer!
This looks so bad
I’m diggin that Blue on Godzilla
Godzilla x Kong huh, I ship it!
🫤…meh
😮😮😮😮😮
I got a bad feeling about this
1:53 OMG Is that Shimu
Taxpayer dollars will be insane for that city
Warner bro my tv got a bit trailer about gxk. I'm waiting to come out  😊
This never gets old.
MOTHRA RETURNS??? I SAW HER
The moment Destoroyah shows up, they both are in trouble.
❤❤❤
No cap, going from the 1st godzilla movie to this. It looks like a fever dream.
Dont like how godzilla ran with kong!?!?😅😅 looked to human like
1:41
After Minus One this looks kinda ridiculous... pink Godzilla. Pander much?
This movie looks atrocious, the effects are terrible and it’s basically like watching a video game.
LETSS FREAKING GOOO SHIMU MY BOY IS COMING
Cant wait for this to be on netflix in 4 years
Is that a mini-kong?? 😮😮
This better not be boozy like Godzilla vs Kong.
what’s going on💀
Time for the American slapstick version of Godzilla.
This looks stupid
Godzillaaaaa !!!  Cant wait for this. Theatre watch for sure.
Godzilla ain’t scared, especially from no monkey 😂.  He’s the Apex predator.
will we get the Godzilla dropkick here?
I am excited for this movie
They are afraid of something? Yeah I guess they are with how ridiculous things are getting.
Its just Looks like a video game now. One giant CGI dump. I wonder if it will tell a good story ?
Everything Wrong with Movies: The Movie
ok
This is gonna be so stupid and so fun
Почему не создать драму, что бы конг убил Годзиллу или наоборот, происходящее выглядело бы ценнее и интересней, но нет бля, они настолько разумны что скарефанились против всего мира
Absolute garbage.
Dude…physics 101, you can’t throw a building like that…and mountain-sized gorilla would just collapse on himself…
So blue godzilla and pink godzilla are 2 different godzillas?
😎
Is there any other feature left behind? Like dinosaur, anaconda, etc.. Bring them back too.. We want the whole jungle to fight...😂😂😂
Kong got use the Infinity Gauntlet and mini storm breaker “ that’s so dope
Super animation 😂
Aint king a titan aswell
Shimo at 2:27 in the bottom right!
😂
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Really...
They have to stop doing this
He won't be alone is a craziest line ever
YO WE GOT SUPER SAYAN BLUE VS ROSE DAWG
Always more :D
It’s like they aren’t even trying with the graphics now a days  Looks like a cartoon
When titanus shimo is revealed??🤔🤔
This is going to be flop unsuccessful movie
damn this is cool
epic
Looks fun and all and I'll watch it as I have every GMan flick starting with Destroy All Monsters at the local theater for a Saturday afternoon Creature Feature in 1972 (movie originally released 1968)...but this side of the Pacific could learn a thing or two about making Godzilla movies.
Everything went downhill after king of the monsters
🔥 Tumhare Charanon Se Mujhe Bahut profit hoga
Domb lie movie same as the audience monkey brain
🔥 Tumhare channel Se Mujhe Bahut profit hoga
Japan and USA will have to work together in order to conquer this new empire thing that is coming  around April 2024 ;) get rdy
No end ❤
Easily the dumbest looking sh*t I've seen yet.  Hollywood just needs to kill itself off at this point.
Kong went “and I am…Iron Man”
Pitch meeting: _"What if we made Godzilla Minus One, but worse in almost every way?"_
Godzilla finally learned from his ancestor heisei gojira I had predicted that he would be able to pulse without his thermonuclear stage
Hopefully its better than the first.
The fact Kong can knock a tooth out of Scar King without his gauntlet is crazy…just imagine how much teeth and maybe bones in his head and neck would break WITH the gauntlet…
Long Live the Kings of the Monsters/HollowEarth! 🦖♦️🤛🦍
I love the movies I hate how they focus on kong more now tho
Big shoes to fill after Godzilla Minus one.  But I bet this will be a great popcorn flick.
Scar king is the beast titan
upper world fighter vs underworld fighter🔥🔥🔥
curious George grew up seeing to much.
Cool , made me smile
This is called a trailer, goosebumps 😮😮
I didn't even think a part 2 was possible
Blackpink Godzilla 😂
Damn hulkbuster!
Godzilla having super saiyan rose is crazy to me.
its gonna be Legendary Battle between Kong and Godzilla And Scar king-
YESSS
Can't wait to see these cgi monsters to fight
Now thats EPIC
Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be epic.
This is gotta be the best godzilla movie ever!!!
1:14 GOT ME LACKING
This looks awful. Too cartoonish.
Kong just got a PowerFist.
Sure im excited. Im only here for Godzilla though.
Standing on business 🎉
Titanus Shimos Eyes
Loved it❤
What the actual f#$# is this and why do I want to see it right now !!!
Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥
Lots of effex and no story.  Hollywood today.
This could be the best one yet. I’m definitely watching
🔥🔥🔥
This franchise just keeps getting worse and worse. Kudos to the writers.
Is it just me or did they use the BRRRT sound of an A-10
So Godzilla got it Disney version too😅🤣
Best part is no Millie brown
It's so crazy baby 🔥🔥🔥
Might have to go to the theater for this one here.
Hate how they push this narrative “even Godzilla and Kong are afraid of Shimu” like why? Because she’s bigger than G-man? Ghidorah was bigger than the G-man he still wasn’t scared. Scared cos Shimu can freeze the planet? Ghidorah was terraforming the planet actively while fighting Titans and then the G-man he still wasn’t scared. I guess he’s scared cos it’s a strong female titan and that’s why. Kong has every right to be scared, G-man whooped him nearly every time they met and Shimu is just a huge Icey Godzilla so makes sense for him.
I can’t wait to watch this oml
Looks stupid
we are gonna see 2 Godzilla in this movie?
Me when it’s march 29: guess it’s time to add 3 more fights (or 2) to my g fights playlist😂😂😂
Why cgi is very unrealistic and looks so bad ? come on guys first Jurassic park movie was released decades ago and looks so much better than this one !
meh
Should’ve let Japan make it
2:27 guys is that snow gamera?! Near scar king
Kinda stupid, though, eh?
oh hey its the Transformers: Rise of the Beasts II !
THIS IS HYPE do you agree? 👇🏻 👇🏻
I hope humans appear less....nobody cares about their story
The sound effects on this trailer are absolutely annoying. Same old same old. Will movie companies every come up with an original idea instead of rehashing the same trailer formula over and over and over again?
i thought godzilla is a good guy. why is he a bad guy again?
Was that another Godzilla with flipping ice breath?!
Crazy now kong and Godzilla vs orangutan 💀
Kong face when he saw shimo was like "Aint no way they got me squaring up with this big ahh ice breaker"
Why do trailers reveal everything?
This is going to be bad .. but good . But bad . Almost Michael Bay bad .
Yoooo shimo fighting the big G. At 0:31
Bernie when he got into hollow earth:I never want to do this again!
*_GODZILLA X KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE_* *_(27 de marzo 2024)_*
So glad AI is hitting stride so we can reveal this thoughtless drivel for what it is: ironic trash.
omg first time see Godzilla run!!! this gonna be cool for sure.
I miss watching trailers in theaters , because you have to guess what the movie is.
Bro godzilla running beo 😂
blue an purple godzillas ?
Mr Crawley is in it worth watching
seeing this opening day fs
Now i have seen the whole movie in the trailer
Mothra will return
2:27 POV I lost to my brother
Mothra will return
the cinematography is relly not there nor the visual effects I hope you have some good character development in this script or this might be a floop
this movie trailer makes me want the movie so bad
Hope no cussing in it. That don't help nothing.🙉🙊
Just to put this out there,  Godzilla minus one's director said on his Twitter that he's seen this movie in an advanced screening and he liked it.
Kong's axe will break when Shimu shoots his ice
So,does it mean that original Godzilla and pink Godzilla will include together ???
this movie gonna break the internet
0:30 I think this is mothra
At 0:30 it shows mothra in her eyes
You know the Monsterverse has got a good one in Shimo if more people are searching this trailer for him over Mothra.
I dont get why are they changing Godzilla movie by movie! Godzilla 2014 and the king of the monsters were not exactly the same, but they seemed bigger and less agile whereas in Godzilla vs Kong and this one Godzilla seems smaller and more atletic, they even change the "color" and the roar...
Aaaaaaaand we’re done
Its extremely important to support this movie in the theater.
They need to stop it now, enough is enough
Do you reckon some point in the movie Shimu freezes Godzilla, and when he breaks free he becomes stronger? Not sure what the pink means though…
Kong and Godzilla Roar + BGM + Visual Effects = Theatre Will be
So said we don't have Biollante, Megalon, Hedorah and Destoroyah, I hope they can do that in the next movie, or put four of em at one movie as antagonists
Is that shimo???????  Alright.. I'm in 😂
🕺🕺
Wait didn't Godzilla kill Kong in the last movie or is this Diddy Kong!!!
They finally reached the Showa Era Godzilla films, uh oh.
ok folks what's their ship name?
My theory is that does other gorilla was force to bow down to the orangutan and we can at their chest is covered with red like paint bc if they don't bow down to the orangutan they gonna get kill this is just theory
Looks dumb.
2:08 Cringe Level is at 9000 LOL! Godzilla Minus One cost 1/10 of this recycled cr@p and is 100x better. But go ahead and eat the shite the corporate suits shovel at you. numnumnum!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sigh.  These movies blow. Can the cash grab stop already?
wow after reading the comments I guess people are this dumbed down carry on lol wtf?
Atomic tatti
omg the best rare movie I ever saw a s a kid and OfCourse they made is beyond stupid      Hollywood needs to stop raping people and hiring family and computer needs   the lack of talent is unreal    what clown wrote this and who paid them to make it?????? a woke King kong and Godzilla? GTFOH!!!
If we pause ate the 2:45 minute then you see kong’s hand,ouch!
It’s stupid 😂 but i am all for it 😊
0:37  I can not wait for a god and a monkey battle it out agents a ape and a frozen lizard.
Garbage just like the last 2
Why do Kong and Godzilla look like humans, not like monsters in general?
I’m just thinking of the look on scarkings face when he sees Kong using the battle axe that scarking probably built ,being used against him , like and comment what you think
I both like and don’t like Godzillas new pulse
nice, now I've seen the whole movie
I will never understand why people like these garbage MonsterVerse movies. Godzilla deserves way better from Hollywood at this point. I’m all for escapist Godzilla/kaiju movies (most of my favorite Toho Godzilla movies are the escapist ones), but these MV movies are just egregious at utterly lousy! They even fail as “dumb” popcorn movies. I’m not having fun when I watch these movies.  If you people enjoy this junk food, enjoy your junk food! I’m definitely NOT seeing this on March 29th. If anyone needs me, I’ll be at home, waiting patiently for “Godzilla Minus One” when it (hopefully) comes out on home media by the end of the year.
Man I can’t wait for this movie.
So much to defeat one monkey... Now I feel sorry for King Gidorah. So If I understand it's like All Monsters Attack or Final Wars. Same for Transformers Optimus Prime dies and get resurrected and Megatron became Galvatron. But yes, I still go to cinema for it
HE HAS NO STYLE
Ah, so they’re basically making a high-budget Showa era film, and I am here for it, no matter how silly it gets.
Godzilla gets smaller by the movie
Greetings, 12-year-old men of culture. We meet again.
2:07 -- Them boyz running together is simultaneously inspiring, touching and hilarious.
El dui
Idk man shimos eyes in the abyss of darkness is such a hard scene
So you saying i have to switch my brain off and just enjoy...  ok
Hearing Shimo charging up was crazy. I had my headphones on and i got goosebumps hearing it
I haven’t been this excited about a movie since Avengers 1, and kinda the same as Avatar 2😂😵
You can see it when Kong punch redkong
Did anyone see shimo
Movie websites anyone ?
I like the fact that Kong and Godzilla don’t exactly like each other still but they’re still gonna need to work together to fight there’s opposites
The atomic Godzilla is back
Caralhooooo mano esse trailer tá mil vezes melhor q o primeiro
Kong and Godzilla reminds me of Goku and Vegeta from DBZ for some reason. 😂
King Kong has a metal glove fist now like a transformers hand. Just stop making the movies
Funny how they didn’t show really much Godzilla in this…or any of him fighting. Don’t know if I should be worried or excited that they’re keeping him fighting shimu a secret lol someone help my anxiety lol
turn to Christ❤😊😊
❤🎉 1:44
❤🎉 1:44
This movie is gonna be so good because you can tell they are gonna really lean into the showa era nonsense but with a much larger budget. my only hope is that we get to see godzilla drop kick another monster.
The baby kong caught me off guard 😂😂
I bet they will show shimo full body in the final trailer around march
Bro that punch from king Kong to scar has to be personally
А я люблю Годзиллу и Конга, но больше всего я люблю Полину❤️❤️❤️😏😛
Godzilla Evolved has definitely grown on me a bit. I just don’t like his proportions a lot. But I am very excited for Godzilla’s near-burning-form.
🎫🎫🎫🎫🎫🎫
MOTHRA PLEASE COME BACK
So it’s basically the rock and vin diesel in a gorilla and lizard suit……..with lasers,!
It’s about time they work together, they’ve had beef since the 90s. I think Ultraman should be in the crew too.
Woah this is the best trailer in my life
the kaiju fighting looks like it'll be really good. This actually made me really excited.
2:27 Kong really said "a tooth for a tooth". Can't wait for this movie!!
Kong wanna be careful trying to mix a batch with that glove on…just saying.
MAAAAAAAAAAAD!!!!!
This shows how CGI can look miles better with just interesting lighting and a layer of film grain instead of just layers and layers of flares, dirt and debris
At the 2:26 mark it looks like Skar King has ripped the mini Kong in half. I hope not, but that would definitely warrant Kong knocking his teeth out of his mouth!
I thoroughly enjoy the monsterverse, don’t care how much lunacy it has, I’m here for it
omg shimu is 2x godzilla in 1!!!! 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
I see my boy Zilla dropped some pounds and took up jogging!
is it made by sora openai?
graphics getting better story getting worser
I'm shocked the director didn't make Kong wear a rainbow-colored bandana & insisted we  refer to Godzilla as Themzilla. C'mon , it's 2024.  I'm truly offended how bigoted Hollywood is these days  😂 🤣 😂
Movies like this is the reason why cinemas Exist
I was expecting Destoroyah.
DOPEEEEEE
Can't wait!!!
Mothra is back
Kong face when he saw shimo was like "Aint no way they got me squaring up with this big ahh ice breaker"
I CANT WAIT TO WATCH ITTT
I was already going to be excited for this film, but much more now that that lavafall clip shows "Kong-but-with-a-whip" not being the biggest bad guy.   Yes, I know it's the "Scar King". That doesn't change the fact that Legendary could use something more creative.
Movies are just getting dumber and dumber. With the new sora openai, you can say goodbye to anything that looks "realistic".  Everything you see soon will be digital. Welcome to the new world, where you will own nothing, see and experience nothing that is real, and be consumed by it all.  NO FREEDOM.  Turn to Jesus while you still can.
Adam Wingard was like “Frik it, make Godzilla glow pink and make him more spiky.” And personally, I’m all for it.
Will millie bobby brown be in this movie?
Holy s*** Kong got the Kung grip now😮
I don't know where human is going? People are dying in this world and these people are busy with these toys, people knew that these creature never exist and still people are wasting time on these movies.
Cool
Bro really threw Kong with shimo like this was luke and the rancor
The fact that the first 23 hours just made 8.3M views for the new trailer is outstanding
I’m hyper asf rn
I don't want metal hands mo more
I CAN'T WAIT
Think they just showed the entire movie
What the f is this😢. Flop!!
Godzilla and Kong more powerful than ever before. This is going to be epic
lmao
If it has king kong and godzilla you know its gonna be a good movie👑🦍
I never though I'd live to see Kaiju Avengers... but here we are.
Hi "BROS" ... Please understand one thing , we dont need this fancy pants underwear wearing kong and  LED  wearing godzlla  ..    Give us the old fire spitting and brainless king Kong.    Thank you
Oxi o macaco teve um filho
Bring back king ghidorah
Сразу скажу-фильм- конченный! Вы из фильма 2014 года сделали марвеловскую фигню!  Годзилла всегда была и должна быть больше самоутверждающейся и обособленной картиной, чем с выдуманной ерундой
Super ❤
The iron fist is insane. The Beast Team is WILD
This looks Silly like it was made for a 8yr old. Remember when TOHO used to make the silly movies and the US used to make the Serious Godzilla movies......role reversal....smh🙄😔😔😔
I love that new blue form that Godzilla is gonna have. He looks like burning Godzilla, except if he was blue.😃
go go power rangers
0:52
Planet of the Kongs
Im confused why is godizlla sometimes blue and sometimes pink
Kong are going to the chasm😮
Why are they making the big lizard and the big monkey fight each other again?
Bruh
where did u find that cause now I really want to know
I hope the series never end I love King Kong and Godzilla ❤❤❤❤
Can't wait to see the new movie
Will there be a mule out front of the theater to kick everyone in the head before going in? I think having a functioning brain will be a bad thing with this movie.
I feel so bad for the humans living in this universe. Every week another major city destroyed lol.
SHIMMKMMOOOO
Yo
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Big MONKE
This is very interesting!
This is epic! Fantastik! Nice
GAYYYYEEEE
Hood on who was the other gorilla king was fighting ??
This Movie is Going To EPIC
Did Kong just put Bumblebee on his arm and come out the transformers 2 Egypt battleground?
y kong got a gaunlet
Nothing for adults anymore
Watching King Kong and Godzilla run into battle side by side gives me chills every time
The fact that the first 23 hours just made 8.3M views for the new trailer is outstanding
Oh no, Kong has the Infinity Gauntlet! We should be careful, he could Thanos snap anyone at any time!
That Punch that Kong landed Tho
The funny part about this trailer is Kong‘s face when he sees Shimo🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nope. Godzilla Minus One vanquished all.
Did we just see electric Godzilla 💀
Awesome.
Kong face when he saw shimo was like "Aint no way they got me squaring up with this big ahh ice breaker"
Awasome trailer😎
After seeing Mini Kong , Simba,the cub  from the Lion King came to my mind .
Shimu the god of all Titans ❤
Now Godzilla and King Kong feels like a cartoon for kids.
Godzilla looks like super Saiyan blue😅😅
Finally we get to see Godzilla's blue atomic pulse in a movie instead of in the comic.
Next project : Batman vs Bioman vs He-Man vs the Schtroumpfs.
2:30 His nuclear pulse is back baby! It's been 29 years since Godzilla charge up his Nuclear pulse at the end of Heisei era. Thank You Legendary.
Stop humanizing Zilla "something he's afraid of" he's a radioactive lizard he has never shown fear even when he loses it ain't no fear
I feel like this movie is going to flop just hope it's better than the first one
either kong hurts skar and he calls shimo or kong was defeated and sentenced to freeze
I came here for the GxK trailer and stayed for the Dan Stevens.
The only negative thing I'll say is that I wish the studios would allow the CG artists more time to refine.  You see with Godzilla Minus One how realistic that looked and that was the result of letting the artists have more time. Lots more time.
If the KING doesn't rise .. The KINGDOM dies .. Bring the fight to them KONG .. 👑🦍 👇
did they use the ear rape version of Penguinz0's wooo yeah babe scream?
I can’t believe were going to see shimo in the movie it’s going to be so cool
This secant trailer is fire 🔥🔥🔥🥵
We see mothra and shimo wtf!
Barbie godzilla 😂😁😅
We see shimo at 2:26, on the right look at 0.25x when kong punch skar king
I Love Godzilla and Kong they are My number 1 Child Hood I grew up watching them and seeing them work together is a Dream come true 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Kong sucks… I dont care and why is their always a deaf girl ?
😲😲😲😲
Please let this movie setup Godzilla vs Mothra 😭 PLEASE let this movie setup GODZILLA VS MOTHRA!!! 💔
Its great to see Kong meeting all these titans because he was kept away from them all in skull island and was only dealing with skull crawlers but Godzilla has been dealing with them all before so he has that experience over Kong
Yo this is gonna be crazy on imax
Imagin Gadzilla Vs Kong Vs Transformers
Godzilla
Well the trailer told everything already.
2:05 Goosebumps everytime 😍#excited
Bruh the stone aren't even hitting the ground
Punisher ı bitirdiğin videoyu atarsın artık
Is that frostbite ??????????
2014's Godzilla is the son of 98's Godzilla - I thought  that time 😅
The first King Kong and Godzilla movies were both iconic. I hate seeing futuristic airplanes and Avengers vibes in the new upcoming parts.
I just know harambe would’ve really liked this movie :(
We got this banger then Kingdom of the apes a lil after that then dead pool 3 a lil after that this year is GOIN CRASY With the movies already 🔥🔥
THE MUSIC AT THE END🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Godzilla is a muslim
if you pause on 0:30 you can see shimo and godzilla fighting
It's gonna be fun man can't wait 🥵😵
is that shimo's roar? 2:13
Looks awesome!!
If not skar king, shimo probably injured Kongs arm in their fight afterwards skar king
Can't wait button ✅
Durooo
*KONGZILLA*
Nah bro not only does kong have the leviathan axe but he also has the gauntlet of zeus next movie he is gonna have blades of chaos☠️☠️☠️☠️
Just giants fighting in slow motion
No matter how old are you if ur monstervers fan your definitely gets Goosebump when u see this types of movies 😅
That was v.good
I have never been more HYPE for a movie before, this is just amazing
The iron fist is insane. The Beast Team is WILD
Maybe they create Kingzilla or Godkong!
NAH THAT IS CRAZY!!!!!! If the hype holds true, this may be the best Monsterverse movie ever made?!
Let's go
Kong punchin teeth out😮‍💨
To me it looks like the nerfed Godzilla.
They look like adheera and rocky
Kong got that infinity gauntlet from advengers war
This is gonna be the king of all movies this year
Can you show Shimmo us better?
Well I'll be a monkeys uncle...
The thing I love is that every Godzilla movie Godzilla breaks a bridge
King Kong vs Walugi Kong
This is like Hobbs and Shaw but with monsters🤣
Be ready for Kong's death. They already showed off his replacement. That small Kong will become King Kong.
Now this is call a Imax worthy movie 🔥
😮
Godzilla and Kong more powerful than ever before. This is going to be epic
Godzilla ain't scared OF NUFFIN!
Omg ✨💯🙏🤩
PAUSE @0:30 MOTHRA! OUR QUEEN IS BACK!

I love the way you care for us thank you for sharing everything with us no need to watch it in theatres anymore
I don’t like the actor
Bro this is what A Marvel/DC fan wants..and Legendary is providing us
Why pink?
new is 2024 godzlia x kiag kong
This is fire 🔥🔥
空からビーム出てるって事はスペース的なGODZILLAが出てくるのか? でもスペース的なGODZILLAの伏線ないし、デストロイアでも青いビーム出ないしこれは公開日が楽しみだわ。
I love monsterverse. Kong is my favorite. This is gonna be awesome.
King kong❤
your official trailer 2 of godzilla x kong: the new empire is the best
2:30 His nuclear pulse is back baby! It's been 29 years since Godzilla charge up his Nuclear pulse at the end of Heisei era. Thank You Legendary.
🎉
I straight up haven’t been this hype for a movie because of a tree in a while, hope it’s good 🙏
Leviathan vs Behemoth 😅 think about it
go get em kong!
Long live King Kong
Can anybody tell what surprises Kong while fighting?
Better be Jet Jaguar.
Shimo is  gonna remind me of the bewildebeast  from how to train your Dragon 2.
If the movie is as good as the trailer, this is gonna be the movie of the year. I CANT WAIT!
I absolutely love the monsterverse! I can’t wait to see this in the movies
Kong got Bumblebee's legendary gauntlet
0:55 godzila twin 😮
wack.
Team Shimo  👇🏻
waiting
👀
2:28 ebirah?
2024 bombarding with Kingdom of the planet of the apes, A Quite place: day one, and finally Godzilla x Kong
SCAR KING GOT HIT SO HARD HIS TOOTH GOT KNOCKED OFF 💀
DAMN Shimu looks cool!
I’m looking forward to seeing Godzilla and King Kong the new empire.
Godzilla and Kong teaming up to thump some skulls will never get old.  Keep it coming Monsterverse!
0:31
Why this trailer feeling like an hour long? ❤
2:08 WTF is Godzilla's running animation💀💀
Baby kong will steal everyones heart 🐵
Goosebumps😮😮😮😮
Why does Skar King look like King Kong from 1962 if he was 150 years old
that left hand by kong was so personal it knocked out a tooth. This is going to be awesome!
Was that ice blast???
So bad, fast food american movie.
I hate the way they animated Godzilla running. He's a frigging lizard, he doesn't swing his arms while running like an ape. Massive loss of respect
Kong snap like Ironman
Spiderman= Godzilla batman= Kong
If the movie is as good as the trailer, this is gonna be the movie of the year. I CANT WAIT!
Welcome to godzilla x kong the new empire
Omg
EITA PORRAAA
Bro Kong haymakered scar king
why ain't this movie showing in valentine's day?
1:52 SHIMU
uploading a 21:9 video in 16:9 with letterboxing makes me not want to see your movie
all i heard was belching noises
I love how they are trying to cover up as much as possible for shimo to not spoil the design reveal
wait so shimu is godzilla but blue
1:42
Godzilla fears nothing, so stupid.
what's the point of regurgitating the same plot over and over again. They part their ways in the last movie, they should now fight together instead of versus. This time they should fight some other nemesis instead of fighting each other again. Not sure if that last scene showing they are fighting some alien :)
Every 10 second looked dumber and dumber
11 million views in one day?!  Holy f***!   Cannot wait for this movie!  Great time being a lifelong Godzilla fan.
Badas cok, Keren Parah 🔥🔥🔥
So now Kong and Godzilla are superheroes? Ridiculous. Terrible. Dumb. Leave Godzilla to the Japanese. They do him right. And Kong was never meant to be as big as a building. And the whole other earth thing is just unforgivable.
I don't have the slightest idea whats happening but this looks fun.
Man I'm so hype for this movie!!! To literally see my boy Godzilla and Eight Wonder of the World King Kong team up again is going to be amazing. God it great to be a Godzilla/Kong Fan right now as we are all eating good :)
Why i hear in the trailer the guy sreaming "hoooooo, yeaaaah babyyyy"    BTW really nice cgi. The trailer look great
Godzilla is no longer Godzilla anymore and king Kong is no longer king Kong
Why does Godzilla only grow a few millimeters? It should be huge by now😬🫠🙃
For me the best is king of monster.. clasic, colosal, no technology, no machine, just monsters fight..
Merattal
Fan from India ✌️
Movie is about to be so freaking epic we are about to we going to watch it at the movie theaters when
gonna be kinda hard to watch this after godzilla minus 1.
Guys there is an update for you.actually there are 2 Godzillas in this movie. The 31 and 30 second clip,the godzilla releases nuclear energy from its body in night  like burning godzilla and in day at city,you can see the 31th clip when it releases energy but its not shown.you can see scar king near the energy and at the corner of that clip there will be evolved pink godzilla fighting with shimo.its my theory.
👏👏👏👏👏
Kong is juiced with that thing & definitely not clearing the Ape-lympics 😂
I hope monster verse movies will never be ending...we love titans
They sold me the movie with the first 10 seconds
Super excited
F##k yeah🎉🎉🎉🎉. That trailer was something else 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Plots getting dumber by the movie but chomp chomp mfkr 😂
I wish they would’ve stuck trying to make them more gritty and real and less flashy/ video game style. The first Godzilla in the series, Kong Skull island and the show and so good because they feel possible. Spaceships, portals, bad CGI and dumbing the movies down was a bad move.
Shimo is appeared in 0.31
My boy Godzilla got an entire electric pulse
KONG IS A SOUTH PA
tharumaru thakili choru
This is goyslop at its best.
wowwwwwwwwwww
😯 Oh my god
Shimo is in 0:31 🤯
The VFX Guys like WETA, Scanline and more are making these movies. incredible what they can create. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO MAKING THESE MOVIES. I dont like the story and i hate the human characters, i dont care about them at all but the Shots the Complexity of the vfx work and Action is Incredible espacially the models from Kong, Godzilla and the other monsters 🔥🤌
Goku beats him 🗿🍷
Damn! PINKZILLA and Cyborg Kong. Can't wait for the movie
Ngl the title sounds like they're shipping Godzilla and Kong
1v2 for king title
Epic battle
Its real
Godzilla's CGI needs slight improvement. Other than that, I'm hyped.
I fell like I saw the whole movie
Finbulwinter is coming  All hail Shimo
so are there 2 godzillas??? wtf is happening, i saw him change a different color of the rainbow every other scene
It’s my 22nd birthday today.👌🏽
KING CEASAR
@kutu film
Give us content from the comics and original films like space Godzilla etc.!!! Spot doing this random shi
Level up
Ugh guess ill catch up on this universe
Sollu!

Idk if this is real
These two giants destroyed whole country
Muuuuuuuito bom. ❤
uuuh😅
माय युटुब
🔥
I'm OK with this. We get serious Godzilla and zany Godzilla at the same time. Why not. Let's be stupid
Is that an orangutan 🦧?
Suuuperb movie...love kong👍👍👍👌👌👌 looks so real the quality is awesome 👌
Koi BKL(Bahut kamaal ladka) hi hoga jo mera comment like karega
Woman power! And deaf young girl power! Woke again! Pass on this! Watch 1933 King Kong instead!
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah.....😛😁🤩
Hn this ain’t no godzilla
Nah, looks Hollywoodized, for the little kids.  And that little monkey, sheesh.
Kong got the infinity guantlate and Godzilla achieved super Saiyan rose
What an marvelous trailer this is gonna be a block buster 😍😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥
Bahut accha hai
the fact that were 4 movies into this universe and the excitement hasnt stopped just goes to show how well these movies are made. Are there some goofy elements? sure. but there is also very dark and intense elements to it as well..... not to mention the CGI is amazing, and there's a lot of fan service in each film. This is an amazing saga and goes to show there is always an audience for movies if you know how to make them.
Hlo
For those wondering, the monster with the ice breath is SHIMO. The first ever titan. The most powerful titan. The father to them all. The creator of the ice age. Going to be some legendary battles.
I am so excited 😊
Jai veeru my I'd nam
YALL WHO IS MOST EXITED FOR SHIMU
I hear Upgraded Titan Drillman sound in 2:34
I have a question mothara is back
this is what a good script looks like
I am very excited to watch this film
Where are the other monsters?
Bumblebee’s hand
Yeah that’s trailer that is amazing🤩🤩🤩💯💯. I see shimo in this trailer
Stupid
Seeing Godzilla and Kong charging towards something together… love it.
1:56 is that SHIMU the first Titan?
Goku black= Godzilla black two's are in the rose mode😂❤
The trailer is mind blowing 😮
Hay que decir que se ve interesante
1:02 Who’s this dope?? What happened to Skarsgard??
2024 is going to be amazing
Ok
भारत माता की jay ❤❤❤❤❤
shimu : I'll freeze you  Fire Godzilla : I'll finish you 🔥 🔥 🔥
Monsterverse >>>>>>>>>>>>> Whole Hollywood (for fans like me)
pause at 0:30 u can see the first look of shimo
Shimu to kong : I will kill you.. I'm a  bad titan Godzilla entry to shimu : hey kiddo if you're bad I'm your dad 🔥 🔥
Let's go!
Fantastic 👍👍👍👍👍👍
I now already need a minilla vs baby Kong movie 😂
Ya know what? This honestly looks sick, they’ve come along way from ten years ago when Godzilla was on camera for a total of like 14 minutes
This is what we wanted from Warner Bros ... No words to about this.. my heart is waiting for March 29 ..
too much human involvement, completely unnecessary, all we wanna see the godzilla breathing blue laser, nothing more
Kong 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Majestuoso!!!
Time trival kong wao
lets goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boi evolved and new form 🤑🤑🤑🤑
Always TEAM KONG LOVE LIVE KING💥💥🔥💯
This is the first time we see fights happening in broad daylight
Why they use wtf boom sound man lmao
Godzilla always loses to Kong in the end. Then somehow they all come back. It's like "pro wrestlers" talking about how they are going to destroy one another then they wrestle around until there is a winner.....and then they both come back.
Pink godzilla xd
Gila🎉
Ah, so they’re basically making a high-budget Showa era film, and I am here for it, no matter how silly it gets.
This trailer is most beatiful of a erection !!!
I just want mothra back 😭😭😭
I think the girl is ascending to be part of mothra because of how she can feels things and the scene that leads up to the tribe of people and her walking up those stairs I believe mothra may show up at the end of this movie I wouldn’t be surprised 🔥
Godzilla fans 👇
If they too join hands again for a common enemy,then damn I am watching this in theatre no matter what,LETS GOOOOO...
this is like an in-game movie than a proper movie. What's up with modern hollywood graphics... They had one job to make it realistic
It looks cool and i will definitely go and see it with my son. But it doesn't look as good as king of the monsters to me.
No Commint
Where is shimo
Kong 😮👀 when he sees Shimu 🤣🤣
It looks like there are two Godzillas in this film ☠️☠️
Dang godzilla looks much raller than usual!
Nice video
0:31 What the heck is that attack？
cant wait to see the final fight with king louie
I can’t wait to see how they are gonna take down Shimu and Scarr king because this looks like a titan fight for the ages 🙌🏾💯👏🏾 and I’m all in for it and seeing Godzilla and Kong roar side by side like that is truly awesome plus the new titian star Diddy Kong being part of this is gonna be amazing 💯🔥🫡
🦖Imagine there is another Godzilla from Japan ( Godzilla minus one) Team up with them 🦍and join to fight The giant Beast Orang Utan 🦧
this looks so garbage honestly the last good one was king of the monsters
Waw
.
Scar king looked small af when he jumped 💀
you both Go ....... yourself
man i miss Godzilla 2014 this is just hilarious and to much, so much that it is boring again and true tension is absent
Shimu is the one that’s causing all the ice to appear or the freezing of everything around 💯
Chilling
ഉഫ് മൈര്  🔥🤩
Man I wish Gamara was part of Mosterverse
Iam so hyped.
Skar king: SOOOOOOOoOoOoOoOoOooNnNnNnNnNnNn Kong: but your an old man a d oldest man in the world😅😅 Skar king: SON WHY IM NOT OLD😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Woaaaahhhhh!!! This is insane !!!!! Gadaanmn it
Guy's if u stop at exact 0:31 u will se shimu fighting Godzilla
CGI craziness.
Humans in kong vs Godzilla are basically useless for the plot, the big guys know their stuff to drive the movie
He was getting pressed so much by kong he called shimo out? Nah that's crazy
Kong with the gauntlet, Godzilla super sayen rose plus curious George
MOAR MUNKEY! MOAR GOJIRA!
Make Prequel The Monsters of Earth like origin story
This gonna create STORM 😲
Make corrover Pacific Rim
OK.. I'm in.  This looks fun to watch at IMAX for sure.
They gave Kong a bonic arm and zilla just keeps on being zilla having the power of ten thousands sun's 😊
Dang did Kong just punch scar king so hard and broke his teeth out that had to hurt 2:27
Warner bros please make a 3rd trailer
The new animated Gol D Roger and Monke D Garp teaming up to fight Xebec at God Valley looks epic!
Kong and Godzilla Roar + BGM + Visual Effects = Theatre Will be
Zor
Please never stop making Godzilla and Kong movie... Me and my family are huge fan of them 🩷
Wow😊😊😊😊😊
I just realized that Skar-King and Shimo may be dark reflections of our title heroes whom are portrayed in a hopeful light. Kudos to Adam and the team!
OMG
Bro Goku didn't change any expressions💀💀☠
Monarch got work to do
NEVER DISAPPOINT 🙂
2:14 if i had to guess what that sound is, it's probably shimo's roar
Best trailer ever
Watched for 12 times and am still not tired of it . Can't wait to see it on big screen .
Tamil Trailer Release date
Warner Bros PictureMate please  make a final Godzilla x kong the new empire movie PLEASE do not forget that 🙏
New godzilla is so tall
And in the final battle they trangs form into the Utltra God King Zilla Kong Mega Zo4d
I can't wait
When godzila -1 will come out to occident?
Cool bro
😊🎉❤❤
A bit strange if you watch this trailer after the new Planet Apes trailer... 😅
Not my proudest nut
We got ssj rose godzilla and infinity gautlet kong before gta 6
Are there any official times for the movie?
they are collaborating?? lol
There are 2 Godzilla
Theirs another Godzilla like titan
Yes! We got a glimpse of shimo
I see Shimu is everyone see 👀👀 1:54
@2:26
Eagerly waiting for the movie.
Definitely going to watch this lizard and ape together beating a chinpanzee
Me waiting for eminem to rap
The way they focused on the physics of the kaijus makes their size and movements alike on humans
2:30 His nuclear pulse is back baby! It's been 29 years since Godzilla charge up his Nuclear pulse at the end of Heisei era. Thank You Legendary.
Can't wait for this, although I really hope they don’t go the route of making Kong the main kaiju of the MonsterVerse. Both him & Godzilla  should be of equal importance (Although personally I wish they focused a bit more on Godzilla). Of course for this movie I can understand why Kong would be more important.
Only 1 word - Legendary  Legacy of Monster-verse
Ice breath godzilla..
Kong's punch is always personal.
kong is very underrated to godzilla wtf
2:39- 2:41 AYO THATS FRIENDLY FI-
1:51 NO PLEASE LET ME LIVE IM NOT READY- GOD GOD PLEASE JUST TAKE ME NOW!!! - Kong probably
Godzilla in pyramid ❤💕🇪🇬
Not loving the evolved godzilla look but im intrigued
How have they not revealed that mysterious godzilla loking thing yet? I feel like it will be on the new villans side.
2:33 that was badass
"Something is coming..."😀 "Something is cuming😫"☠️☠️☠️
100°/• better than  trailer 1  💥
2:34 is Penguinz ranking scream and you cant convince me otherwise
Can’t wait let’s go ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
Wow, I am eagerly waiting for this movie
It’s confirmed that I’ll sponsor 10 of my friends to watch this bangger🫡💪🏻
TRAILER IS LIT! 🔥 Epic battles, cool cast, can't wait till March! 🎥
My life is complete after watching this whatttt is this
Was that the mega godzilla that goji center preducted
Shut up, take my money, and play the Movie
Godzilla + King kong combo 🔥 The war Between Human vs Animals
These movies are Kong with special guest appearance from Godzilla
I don't like the cgi already
Tag match heeee yaaaa😂😂😂😂
I can't wait for this movie
I just can't get over how dumb it looks to see Godzilla running
Wow the trailer give me goosebumps 😮
"Let them fight."
Something about these movies hits different and i absolutely cannot get enough of them. I can't wait for season 2 of monarch and more of these movies. They're just so fun. Ill watch this atleast 2 or 3 times in theaters
That left hook from Kong on scar king knocking out his teath is so satisfying
0:31 shimo godzilla
This Movie Is Gonna Be The Most Epic Movie Of 2024 ❤️🔥🔥
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Adam winggard i hope you will make the next movie called: Godzilla x Kong the new rivals
What are they cooking bro🤯
Did everyone forget the giant spear thing in the first trailer that stabbed the ground in Brazil?
This is gonna be the best movie 2024
Theres another godzilla that will be the enemy?
Kongs reaction to shimo reminds me of a specific black guy shocked idk who  Edit: i think the guy was kanye
Godzilla VS Shimu 0:30
I think this the most epic trailer
Red Monkey looks so funny
शानदार❤
This franchise went the way of F&F 🤣 Take me back to when Godzilla was just stealing VHS tapes from trucks. Nah but seriously I'm glad people like the look of this movie but I'm gonna go watch the first Godzilla (2014) movie again, that one actually had style and restraint 🥲
Gonna be trash 🗑 so now adding skins will make them cooler or the movie interesting 🤨 where are we aheading
0:30 if you pause on the eye you can see mothra 0:31 if you pause you can see skar king fighting Kong/suko and Godzilla fighting shimo
Granny revamp 0.9.0 update rondomize. Selendirina. Flaslagid. Comig soon 🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲
My third time watching this trailer 🥴😂🔥🔥🔥
We want fighting between these titans we don’t want much talking and nonsense
❤❤❤
No way they add Godzilla and Kong winning at last scene, ain’t interesting again because it’s happy ending again 🤧😏
Just epic🎉🎉
Wow cool
ahgg fackk this is so cool
Looks like they’ve marveled up this franchise too. Smh
Waiting for godzilla x kong x transformers
Shimu!
Last scene looked sorta goofy
THIS FILM WILL BE A SUCCESS AT THE BOX OFFICES.
How long will this 2 keep fighting for
*Godzilla Final Wars 2004:* (Goji in his prime) *Godzilla 2014:* (Coming out of retirement with dad bod) *Godzilla x Kong 2024:* (1 decade of exercise & rad. shakes)  Truely inspirational👏👏👏👏👏
I’m gonna say Shimo is the glacial counterpart to the Godzilla species.
With whom these two guys will be fighting..??
Thank goddd.......no madison
SPOILER ALERT: Now SHIMU Kaiju face Godzilla.. at last.
Godzilla X Kong.                 🦎         ❤          🦍
Amazing trailer 🔥
As long as it’s better than the first failure.
Ооо, мини Конг
Why see the movie when I just saw the entire movie? lmao
🤍🔥🫡
YO I THINK RODAN IS COMING BACK BECUZ AT 0:49 THE SHADOW LOOK LIKE RODAN
Wow thanks for 1 million likes guys😅😂😂
Who’s the villain ?
Cant wait to watch when film realise😊
Amazing
Its getting better and better
it will be a movie abouth death girl with kong and godzilla for 5 min in background ?? oh and with baby kong as diversity
Soper
did we just watch half the movie?
This 3 mins trailer alone is better than anything marvel ever produced
Is this based on a true story??
Why are the Jets attacking Godzilla?
0:52 pause it
Godzilla 2024 blue and Godzilla 2021 what’s the difference
Kongbuster 🥶
Please never stop making these movies, lots of action and monsters, still makes me feel a kid, god I love sci fi and Godzilla
Shimu is coming😶
Godzilla's thermo form in 2019 was sick and now??? EVEN MORE EPIC ITS BLUE NOW
We could've had Godzilla and Kong vs Gigan and Megalon, but no, we get a mirror fight. Of all the tropes to copy, this is the dumbest one.  I hate it.
Esse filme parece ser muito grande,pra mim e mais de 2 hrs e meia
how is this still not trending
godzilla finally reach super saiyan rose wow
My favarit goodzila and kong 💪💪💓💓 Goodzila king 1  Kong king.....  2
The theory is real, shimo is real the ice breath is from shimo
@Saranya_kolam_creation
This trash has nothing more to do with Godzilla
The ultimate battle of the Titans! Kong and Godzilla charging in together is pure excitement!
Is dat shimuuuu
In your face Disney woke
I don't think I'll ever get tired of seeing Godzilla and Kong bust heads on the big screen.
Hold on a sec... Was that... Mothra?
This is gonna be fire
Yo why no one is saying this is the best monstrverse trailer ever
Despite all the hate I would rather pay for this movie than any marvel movie.
Inspiration bro
Even though the plot falls apart if you think about it but it's kind of cool to look at monsters punching each other
Looks better than the kingdom of the planet of the apes 😮
Will Mothra appear?
OK i understand the problem. They look weird scale wose when there is nothing to compare their scale to. The girst few monsterverse movies had buildings for scale and a lot of shots sere from human perspective so they looked huge. Now there is nothing to compare to so now the Godzilla model looks weird
This looks like the beginning of Godzilla's villain arc.. cuz like. In every movie Godzilla always get bombed even if he spends 3 days fighting off a doim titan.. and he's also getting to his ultimate form. With shockwave attacks and super massive. Tbh I'm getting tired of people always shooting Godzilla
After watching Godzilla Minus One, I know I'm going to be sorely disappointed that this movie is not anything like it. It's one of the best movies I have ever seen.
@2:27 that left hook was brutal.
Who freeze kong? Is that shimo🙂
"oh shi- monke he's behind us! Run!"  -Godzilla
Is it just me but at 0:30 it kinda looks like mothra or is that just me?
G O O S E B U M P S
That Left Hook from Kong was sick af 🔥🔥
Welcome back Mothra @ 0:30 !
Why do the humans act and speak like they matter?
My comment also famous one day😢😢
Aik din mera comment bhi viral hoga😢😢
24 is their year already.
Next level entertainment😊 if you enjoyed then like here & Subscribe😅
I bet kong lost his finger or hand during the fight
0:31 there are 4 creatures there
Woooohooo
1:26 Is MOTHRA'S EGG AND IT'S GLOWING LIKE GODZILLA?
Kong face when he saw shimo was like "Aint no way they got me squaring up with this big ahh ice breaker"
2:26 that punch feels like personal to me
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why this trailer hasn't reached 1 million like
Looks like fun.
OMG moistcr1TiKaL is in this movie?! 1:13 / 2:33
Scar king, Shimo VS Kong, Godzi and Global Warming:)
Hang on...where's THE MESSSAGE? Is Kong non-binary?
Does anyone watch it 100 times and still like it?
#SaveCoyoteVsAcme and stop releasing garbage WB
"They don't have to like each other, They just have to work together" oh boy
The comments section is just filled with Godzilla and Kong fans! Damm Happy to see i am not alone who is Just crazy for both of them teaming up together to take down the BadAss Skar King 😅
❤❤❤❤
Looking them fighting together  is giving me goosebumps🔥🔥 This is truly mayhem💥
👍👍👍👍👍
Hmmmmm... I don't know how to feel about this!! :/
2:34 This sound like the titan drillman for skibidi toilet multiverse
90% of the movie will be humans
The movie looks amazing I really wanna watch it🎉
Ohhh my my my god,, wt they had made 😮😮😱😱🤯
Don't cast this humans .. just make kong and godzilla fight. Even no single dialogue in whole movie will be okay. Just remove this useless people
1:53 bro got some god eyes
"Long live the KING 👑"
The last scene of the trailer Godzilla be like : oh my gosh not this guy again
2:27 bro is in rage mode🤣🤣
They still attacking kaijus with airplanes at low altitude😂😂😂
Kong! Please Run together with Godzilla !! Make it More Pinky!!!
Cant wait, this releases on my birthday!
Did anyone notice shimu at 0:31 fighting godzilla at the left
This 3 mins trailer alone is better than anything marvel ever produced
I commented
As an indian. having seen such giant level ape action, makes me feel as if HANUMAN himself chose kong to be his warrior, EPIC ACTION COMING UPP... can't wait.
Lezzzgooo
Maret
Michael Bay called,  he wants his filming career back
10 millones de vistas, que satisfacción mi Godzilla 🥹♥️
എന്റപോന്നോ 🔥
I swear when i heard, " and even they (Godzilla&Kong) are afraid of it." I nearly lost my braincells
amazing movie and very interesting watching of the year❤❤❤enjoying to watch best movie of the year 2024❤
Am I the only one thinking actually there is going to be 2 Godzillas in the movie ? 😅 How it is possible for the Bulky Blue Godz to go through transformation just because shimu woke up !! Pink Godz doesn't even know who is Kong it seems & tail of Two Godz looks very different & the Blue one with a big belly 😂 Shimu was brought not from cocoon & the pink Godz doesn't seem to be coming from cocoon either like mothraa
1:53 This is Shimu 😱
the teeth
Jesse Christ and I thorough Thai the first trailer could-dent be beat
Tag team Match  Skar King & Shimu VS Kong & Godzilla  in a bra and panties match.
Wow. Looks like someone's been working really hard to win that "Stupidest Movie Ever Made" award!
This gon' be a banger 💥
Damn this franchise ain't stopping any time soon.
My head hurts just watching the trailer. Make it stop!
2 Godzilla 😱😱
Wtf this is going to be toooo insane 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🔥🔥🔥
That ice those who knows
Can March 29th be tomorrow? I wanna see this so much
मतलब कुछ भी बना रहे हैं। 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eee Ka Bawal Bana Diye Ho Beeee 🔥
Anyone remember when the 2014 Godzilla and 2017 King Kong films tried to be grounded?  Well, we reached the anime levels of craziness now.
A ice type kaiju ? I wonder did he the one seal Ghidorah in ice, I always curious about that detail in king of monster.
this is what the usa does best to divert attention for the gumps while the administration cause chaos and death around the world .
HOLY F*CKING S*IT! CAN't WAIT FOR THIS!
Bro I watched this trailer 5 times
Ah, so they’re basically making a high-budget Showa era film, and I am here for it, no matter how silly it gets.
I can't wait for this!
Now this is what we've been waiting for, A new trailer indeed
still gonna see it but man you give to much in trailers and leaked toys
“Ohhhhh yeahhhhhhhhhhhh”
I can't wait for the Godzilla x Fast & Furious cross over
Wow omg
🔙
this is wayyyyyyy better than the 1st trailer.
Now thats how a special effects movie is made
Nice
Is that mothra? In the eye's reflection 0:30
I feel like going in depth in the name of elaborating is making unpleasant
Hearing Godzilla's Atomic breath charge is a sound i could listen to for the rest of my life and never get tired.
Need it Now
🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🍇🍇🍇🐧🐧🐧🐧💝💖💗💓💜💙💚💛🧡❤❣💟💕🤎🖤🤍♥💞
Im confused is there 2 godzillas?
Alter!! Noch epischer als der erste Trailer. Ich kann es kaum erwarten, bis der ins Kino kommt!!
This is gonna be a visual treat for sure!!! Please don't be cringe 🧨
Aw….a mini Kong! 😊😊😊😊
I FREAKEN CANT WAIT TO SEE IT !!!!! AWESOME. !!
Team Kong❤
I think Godzilla and kong will have conflicts again
Wait is Godzilla thermonuclear or now a lighting Godzilla!?
Now that's an infinity gauntlet from the multiverse 🗿
WHERE IS THE VOICE OF KONG'S SUPPORTERS...✊✊✊✊🔥🔥🔥🔥
Since when did the deaf girl had a psychic powers they never hinted about her new powers they just made it up out of nowhere 10/10 plot right there
This looks so dumb
Boom 💥❤
finally something worth to watch on theater
HYPEDDD
Silly narrative to say Godzilla is afraid. Godzilla always welcomes a challenge. Looks like a good movie though the film length is shorter than all the others.
Still waiting for humanity to start the Jaeger program so we can get the crossover of the century.
this is so mid asf
Absolute rubbish
Team godzilla
2:22 wait TOM HIDDLESTON?????????????
Tumhe papa qasam like karo
B
2:04 yeah its gonna be 🔥
Wish they never stop godzilla and kong movies...they most badass monsters in whole cinema history...godzilla all the way baby
Ting j yogfvjo😅yg❤fhu🎉fhj😊
Amazing😮😮😮😮
Insane 🔥🔥🔥🔥
my heart goes out to ya'll in Cairo and Brasilia folks. ya'lls cities are the next ones bout to be clapped😞✋
Блядь это будет мощно,спасибо что радуете меня старого героями моего детства❤
This trailer feels like whole movie for me😂😂
the CGI is terrible
The scar king is drago bloodfist  and shimo is the bewilderbeast .
This looks way too cartoon like. I dont know, it just looks way to cheesy and over the top, like its trying way too hard to be awesome. And the cgi looks like it getting worse because of it. No very hyped after seeing this.
Hearing Godzilla's Atomic breath charge is a sound i could listen to for the rest of my life and never get tired.
Godzilla and kong Team together 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
noice🤩
is that tiny orange monkey Sun Wu Kong or am i wrong
Now Kong feels too human and not Ape like. I think it’s headed in the wrong direction. He even looks more human now which takes me out of the experience.   I don’t think this movie will do well. I think it’ll be forgettable long term.
0:31 godzilla fighting Shimo
WAITING FOR SHIMU 🥶💥..... This movie is gonna be epic 🥵
10M VIEW'S IN 1 DAY 🦍🦖  #godzillakong #thenewempire
Godzilla and link more powerful than evet before.this is going tobe epic
All i need is kong or godzilla to give the optimus prime speech at the end..we must come together to rebuild a better future 😂
It’s 2024 and we still can’t have better cgi, I feel like we’re going backwards
Showing the Metal Hand 5x before the ending the trailer with a  “reveal of metal hand” is extremely stupid.
Monke vs Orange Monke  Pink lizard vs cold lizard     What a epic fight
2:33 scream sound like pinguin0z😂
Is that frozen godzilla or lightning godzilla
2:08 KONG & GODZILLA running together ❤️
I don't think I'll ever get tired of seeing Godzilla and Kong bust heads on the big screen.
2024 is the Year of Dynamic Duos: Godzilla & Kong, Deadpool & Wolverine, and, . . . Batman & Robin?
0:54 very crazy
They better kiss.
I'm Godzilla.........
They made G red Goku.
Song kong and godzilla fight again kong vs scar king, shuma(or whatever) vs Godzilla seems dope
Disney fumbled the bag with Star Wars and Marvel fell off massively, but the Monsterverse is going strong with Monarch and now this. So hyped! Keep making these!
This look too 🔥
Shame that we went from the pretty grounded aesthetics of 2014's movie to basically anime
2:13 Rio de janeiro -Brasil!!
I love this whole universe so much. It’s so much fun and looks amazing.
King Kong is back 🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Why all look so fake like a marvel movie?
Bro please just give kong his lightning powers
WB got my letters! All my ideas are in this movie!

I have a feeling Skar King is somehow going to gain control over Godzilla for a minute.
Monkey and lizard best friend 🐊🦍

what is this? power rangers?
Godzilla vs kong
Is that Ping Pong the small?
Terbaik 🎉
Nice

Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be epic.
2:26 shimo face
😭😭😭🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bsby Kong👍🏾👍🏾
Goosebumps
Uma Pillai Dixit, mai tatti karne baitha hu paani nhi aa rha moter chala do...
The Godzilla running tho... Still feels weird.
Big monke and side of Doritos shall fight stinky monke
I think you revealed too much..
Nice movie 😮
Don't you all get bored with apes fighting with lizard....after all those years..
GodzillaxKong will rise together or fall alone what will you choose? Long live the king and the god!
These kinds of trailers always make me tear up of excitement and pure awesomeness
Looks absolutely terrible.
I am gonna count the number of claps & whistle in theater
🥰 jo bhi comment padega use apni maa ki kasam hai subbuscrib karo 🥳
After this the actions are next level ❤❤❤❤❤
Thia was super trailer
The fact that the first 23 hours just made 8.3M views for the new trailer is outstanding
They don't have to like each other Me: look at the end of the trailer
Well. That looks ...  ambitious.
This look promising, really can’t wait
Take my money already… Super excited for this one already 😍😎
Kong is only as tall as Godzilla's kneecap.  This is dumb.  They are not in the same weight class at all!
💣🗿
1:56
Guys neww vedio out plz watch
Was wondering why this was made but was surprised to learn that the previous entry made a $100M profit.
This blue godzilla form looks for me better than the evolved godzilla form
Rise up the 2 kings of the monsters
who gave Kong an Arioch Power Fist!? Kong gonna be like that guy at school showing up for the anticipated fight with a set of brass knuckles
This looks amazing
Next they'll make a Dancing Rainbow Godzilla, and say it's because of his radiation output.
Goji looks pissed!
Now this is a movie I wanna watch at the theatre
Baby Kong CGI is super boo boo.
2 bros on an adventure
Awesome
Damnnn what a trailer!!!!!!! So excited
One of the few movie franchises that makes grown men giggle like little kids 😍
น่าดูมาก
Meh, better have King Caesar in it!
Looks awful and cheesy. Leave the monster films to Japan
im sleep
I only hope that, they will focus on the monster not the hooma. And I hope, the hooman does not include in the fight between the monster just like last fight.
This comment section has so many Godzilla nerds ecstatic. Like wow I am truly happy for you all.
0:30 there is shimu watch in slow motion
Lol what in the marvel universe have they done to godzilla ? Lol 😑
Indian Fans please ❤❤❤
2:27 shimo spotted
Godzilla sound will always remains epic
This is crazy
This is crazy
This will be epic
This looks sick. I don't even care about the story Kaiju battle all day!
Why does the beat sound like moistcritikal whooing lmao
🤯🤯 Ya quiero que se estrene 🔥🔥
I'm totally going to try to see this in theaters.
In today's world  kong and Godzilla
It took me awhile to catch up. But I am sure glad that I did. These have been more amazing than I could ever see expected.
Break down of this bout to be crazy! First time watching and I’ve already seen a ton of storyline! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Iam super excited
Did you guys know?: That in the first clip of this trailer you’ll see Kong in the sand fighting another kaiju named Shinto.
🔥🔥
I can't even begin to describe how boring this was.
That punch was personal😂
Aw man, mini kong looks like my son when he was a toddler.😅
Quem me dera se o kong ganhasse um poder de raio ingual Thor seria muito louco😮
Kidporn
Super wild the new Godzilla x King Kong  😢😮😊😅🎉🎉😂❤❤
Dude. Im gonna cry when monsterverse ends. This is a masterpiece
IM HELLA READY FOR THIS
2:27
Now I’ve seen everything. Yeah, the trailer showed the whole movie
this looks stupid
Shimo is coming
that blast that kong blocked with his axe. it looks like a ice blast 1:50
Based on a true story.
Oh man Minus One, Monarch and now this! Eating goooooood!
THAT WAS AMAZING!!!!!!
Bruuuuuhhhhh they hyping up shimu soooo much and all u see are his eyes this is finna be gasssss
What I already don’t like about this movie is they’re not using any of Godzilla’s many foes that need to be in this franchise.
What a noisy messy trailer
Kong and Godzilla running together is a masterpiece... Goosebumps brooo❤❤❤
Godzilla and Kong in Rio de Janeiro? Godzilla's tooth and Kong's glove will be stolen after recording.
Agriculture &organic farming.  Youtube.
Ngl, for as much as I didn't like the Showa era of Godzilla films, the fact that this embraces Showa's silliness doesn't bother me. SUPER hyped to see it, actually
❤️
Team Scar King
Meccha King Ghidora 😏
Now Im excited!!!
Kong Gtes a power fist and Godzilla goes super saiyan 2, damn this is what they should have started with in the trailers!
Godzilla using his atomic pulse, Kong & Skar King in the fighting ring, Kong trying to block shimo's ice breath with the axe like I'm lost for words
Bring  the  titans  from  king  fo the  monstrous
Mast video
Seeing this in IMAX is a guaranteed headache. If not an all out panic attack
BRO ITS EXACTLY TITANS HAVING 2v2 MATCH!!!! GODZILLA VS SHIMU and KONG VS SCAR KING
They went from being dramatic sci-fi films to big, crazy sci-fi action films.
1:42 awww nah not the beast titan
Gommala idhanda cinima 🔥🔥🔥
Did I just watched the whole movie 🧐🧐🧐
The last shot of Godzilla and Kong screaming is so god damn goofy lmao excited for this
1:50 going in my instragram gif with that kong reaction
why do the apes have a better society then planet of the apes
huh...Ghostbusters and Godzilla sharing the same ice-theme villian?????
Team Kong! 😎🦍
Brene
"and I am King Kong" Snaps his fingers*
Goji fans assemble twice.  We're in for a double intimidation display treat!
How amazing would it be if Rodan and Mothra roll up!
I got no idea what’s going on. But I’m still watching this day one. Godzilla and King Kong are just too iconic to not watch
Kongs vs Kremlings I’m calling it right now this is just a small introduction to the Donkey Kong Movie King Kong = Donkey Kong Godzilla = King K. Rool
Too much CGI. Godzilla minus one got the balance right. Hollywood never does
Amazing
So, Kong and Godzilla are basically Goku and Vegeta now?
This is really epic cool i am excited for the movie
Brilliant
Who Gave Zilla Steroids 😮😂😂
Kong is now inevitable.
Nah bro the jumping in this film is gonna be insane even crazier than the jujutsu kaisen ones
The monsters are becoming more and more agile.
Peak fiction
Main youtuber hu Mera YouTube channel hai Aapke channel se meri madad ho sakti
2:32 Godzilla Earth vibes

くだらねえのを本気でやってて好感大。マイゴジと同じくらい楽しみ。
I AM VERY BIG FANS OF MY KING KONG ...KING KONG IS MY HERO ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this looks so awful.
Teeth out scene of scar was awesome 😎
Kong's Tooth 2:49
SHIMUUUU
Impossible the scar king is the hollow earth king
El hijo de Godzilla y Kong se llama GodKo
same like the previous one
i will be seated
cgi is getting insane
So Kong with the gauntlet, is he gonna do the snap or…? 🫰🏽
1:15 this be became meme after full release GXK NEW EMPIRE 😂😂😂
That raging Godzilla is something else
Man gojira still got that power to beat kong 😂
Sensacional,ainda mais tendo a mothra de volta que épico
Wake up dad, the monkey and lizard are fighting again.
SHIMO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OMG OMG OMG
This is gonna stink 😂😂
🔥🔥🔥
Easy gonna be one of the best over the top monster movies of all time.
The visuals looks amazing definitely gone watch it my dad always made us watch the original Godzilla vs Kong can’t wait for this version
Yeah i’ll stick with Godzilla Minus 1
WE GOIN BACK TO HOLLOW EARTH WITH THIS ONE🗣️🗣️🔥🔥
MOVIE OF THE YEAR
this is the definition of jumping the shark lol
Menit 2:27 wajah shimu terlihat.... Sangat mirip sama action figur mainannya
SHIMO
Надеюсь это не свяжут с варзоном вновь
This movie looks horrible.....
This is beyond epic. Can't wait for Mar 29th in IMAX
I think I saw whole movies in trailer so bye bye
❤❤
I thought it was about to going 2 against one but  this trailer changed my probability it is about to going 2 against 2
Bullsh Godzilla ain’t afraid of anything.
Take my money
Solo espero que el director no humille a Godzilla como en la anterior. Una nueva movie de Kong. Kong 3. Godzilla solo. Kong con la ayuda del Director,  del guion, de su team .   No humillen al más grande de todos. GODZILLA merece su película. Ya es hora.
2 different Types of Godzilla One I’m fine and the other I’m on a Period 😂
So dumb….. more Hollywood garbage
Looks sick. I hope they don't weigh it down with a bunch of human drama. I'm just here for the Kaiju fights. 🦍🦖
Are they monsters or superheroes? This franchise is so stupid please fire the writers
Telugu kong and godzilla fans❤❤
Ommmala podu
Kong just took doom fist's look.
When you go to the restaurant and pick the same food every time.
Well you gotta love it when they add way too much information in the trailers.  Makes for a boring movie.
I can’t wait I can’t wait
If you dare delete coyote VS Acme movie, you will make this movie again, over and over again.
King of the Monsters & King of Skull Island vs the Skar King
Crossover of dragon ball and marvel
Godzilla super Saiyan rose
Kong with the infinity gaunlet and godzilla with the super saiyan rose is insane
They better release this faster 😤
Scar king is hangrey did you see how skinny he was😂    Also still no rodain!!!!!!!😢
😮😮😮😮😮
Godzilla 😊❤
This looks absolutely horrible. Wtf. I might like it if i was like 10 years old.
Sign me up.
I’ll be pretty dang Surprised if they some how added the “Mulitverse” to this movie lol
Sab ko jumma mubarak ❤❤ 16/02/2024
That last punch was awesome 🔥🔥🔥
Brasil 🇧🇷
The Americans have stripped all the character from this franchise and turned it into a soulless, generic action movie.   You will never be Toho, Legendary.   #HOLLYWOODTRASH
❤❤❤❤
That BEAMING UP sound of GODZILLA entry to help kong gave me goosebumps
Their are 2 kong and 2 Godzilla??🤔
Why use the obsolete WB logo in the titles? Strange move
The monsterverse is ruined
Kong is having thanos Infinity Gauntlet😂😂
I swear I heard a distorted version of Moist Cr1tikal's "WOOOOO Yeah Baby!" a few times during that
So RoboKong is gonna team up with Redzilla and beat Red Kong?
Wondering if anyone else is thinking this…  Listen to the “WAGHHHH”!!!  @1:14 , @1:26 , @1:56 , @2:33   That roar is Shimo! Has to be. Sounds badass, huge, terrifying, and powerful.  You can kinda hear it when Kong is blocking Shimos Ice Breath..
Is that blue thermo
Hopefully this is good, because Godzilla minus one set a high bar
Joder only say.    it's worth it 💩 Marvel.   Now the Monsterverse and video games movies are the best Box Office❤
मैं YouTube हूं  मैरा चायनल 💯🔥💯😎💯💯😎💯💯💯💯
Wait, did King Kong arm break when he was holding the ax and it froze when he was fighting Godzilla ice I still don’t know how it looks. I don’t know I know it’s like a Shimmo or something his name it looks like a Godzilla, that what Kong was afraid of.
Godzilla doesn't look right in a full sprint...
só vale a por ter explodido o RJ
I can't wait for the dragged out human scenes during monster fights.
Godzilla in King Kong is not afraid of the other gorilla they’re afraid of the ice one the ice Godzilla I believe we don’t know how it looks
I see shimu
Way more better than teaser
My wallet gonna be mad at me this year
Man this just gets more and more stupid.
Looks like a cartoon movie
0:31 main scene
😮😮😮
The thing I love is that every Godzilla movie Godzilla breaks a bridge
i am definitely ready for this
This is the number 1 movie I want to watch
😂😂😂 why is Godzilla and Kong  running like they are in  Olympics
Have you guys ever noticed evolved Godzilla’s biggest dorsal plate looks like Mindanao island in the Philippines. The exact place where the mutos came from, where dragons carcass is, and where the ion dragon was discovered. That can’t be a coincidence right?
Scar king is whipping those FILTHY monkies
😬😬😬🔥
#SaveCoyotevsAcme
Kong vs Godzilla is better than MCU right now.
Love it 🫶🏼💘👾✨
I can’t wait for this to come out!
Let's go boyyyyzzzzzzz this looks awesome.
is that a second godzilla?
the guardians of nature...there's something even they are afraid of - a can of hair spray from the 80's :)
Pause about 31 seconds it shows a city fighting scene look up and right you can see godzilla and shimo going at it😮
Estoy más que seguro que, van a hacer algo con el diente de scar King. Lo presiento
EASILY MOVIE OF THE YEAR.
You had my curiosity....now you have my attention.
Looks like a Primale Rage movie and I'm all about it
stupid. perfect for mindless kids
10 million views
Brazil.......I'm devastated
Feel like I've seen the whole movie already by watching this trailer 😶‍🌫️
Next king kong x Transformers 😅😂
True ngl
PUBG player redy to play new kong and godzilla😮😮😊
This am excited about.... Godzilla has always been my favorite since day 1🎉
Come on... 😂
Godzilla looks op can’t wait for some lazer breath action 🔥 and that kong and skar king 1v1 finna go crazy can’t wait!!!!
hype af
What they should really make is Godzilla and Kong buddycop
Finally a well deserved Godzilla x Kong Movie
Big monster go smash! Rawr!
Soon Kong and Godzilla will be in Avengers secret war
Nowadays trailers show too much
A gauntlet huh..well, i do hope somewhere here suddenly gypsy danger appear..we all know mankind need their rep in this fight
As a Brazilian living in Rio de Janeiro, everyday I'm afraid of being robbed. Now I have to be afraid of being crushed by a giant ape and a giant lizard. Very cool.
Could have sworn the release date was in April not match
Kong's punch is always personal.
From ancient rivalry to standing together!  If Godzilla and Kong has shown us anything, it’s we must have each others back and conquer anything that gets in our way!  STAND TOGETHER OR FALL ALONE
Why they don't bring giant orange cat?
King Kong x Bigfoot 1:43
That's shimo if you look closely. Put it in slow motion. 0:30
Team of Godzilla 💗💙
Ooo I CANT WAIT into this comes on HBO MAX😂
Should have said spoiler alert before the trailer.😂😂😂
This doesn’t look good
Love it but you showed waaaaay tooooo much in the trailer
Brothers
to, scar king whipped that building was legendary
1:26 meme reference Bros 😂
0:31 you can pause at the right time and you'll see a clip of the final fight. Looks like Shimo fighting Gidzilla on the right and Scar King in the center. Can't spot Kong though
The only thing i wanna watch is this fight 1:44 bcuz this monster 1:41 kill Kong parents.
Number 4 on trending! This movie is going to be HUGE!!
0:31 vistazo entero a shimo. 1:47  que son los ojos 1:53  que son los ojos y el aliento de hielo. 2:13 en Brasil con ese aliento nuevamente.  2:26 y se muestra el hocico a la derecha, antes que kong golpea a scar king
1:25 has to be a mothra egg
Gear 5 luffy make the 1v2
I see shimu kong fight to the skar king godzilla fighting shimu  how skar king's word be godzilla in skar king's world i see a blue eye  i thing that's godzilla
2 of the baddest kaiju in the same place at the same time! Epic!
LET’S GOOOOO!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🦖
Tartarus prison got broken. Monsters are out. The Greeks gods are coming from far away. The big giant spaceship was detected and coming straight to earth. Will the Greek gods give Godzilla a chance and giving him a job to be the watch guard of Tartarus?
Omg we're finally getting monsters fighting with good visibility. Finally studio knows why we watch
This is insanely good looking
J'adore la référence à la série Monarch
Darnn they run like Usain Bolt
Does anyone think they are going too far? Just asking
I’m starting to get worried for the Monsterverse. GVK felt like a marvel movie and considering how bad marvel is nowadays, I’m scared. But this has made me less worried, it actually looks good, let’s hope the movie is as good as the trailer.
Thanks for showing the whole movie
This is why cinema was made
🤢🤮
Cada vez mejoran a Godzilla y nerfean a Kong
Kong and Godzilla Roar + BGM + Visual Effects = Theatre Will be
Vi a Godzila y a shimo
They're not even trying anymore. Kong with an Iron Man gauntlet? And the cg literally like a cartoon.  Does anyone else remember the serious tone of Godzilla 2014 and KOTM?  I think I'll just watch Minus One again instead of this garbage.
Alexander Skarsgård?
Well well well bruh.
Just waiting for those two to settle there differences through a game of uno or rock paper scissors
march is gonna be the best month
🤢🤮
insane😅💥
Going to become a next level movie of this year
Get ultraman in this franchise Stat!
You guys should add Mechagodzilla to this
That Punch that Kong landed Tho 😳😳
Our biggest fears have came true
So Kong is part cyborg, and Godzilla is a feminist now, and they’re fighting Kong’s iPad kid cousin. WTF is this movie and why am I hyped for it?!
Tayang diindo kapan ?
First trailer: kinda mid Second trailer: OMG RELEASE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
بجد انتم مصدقين نفسكم،،، مين الحمار ال بيعملكم الخطط التسويقيه دي ،،، بعم خدو البلد وخلصونا يارب تولعوا بيها ايه الامبراطوريه الجديده وتكسروا الهرم ايه الهيافه دي خطط واضحه جدا
E o povo do planeta terra só se lasca
Why is Godzilla blue an pink too he has 2 powers up an what was Kong blocking with the axe was that Godzilla or something else besides them 3
How is is possible that the CGI looks worse and worse.  Everything looks cartoonish, rushed and unfinished. Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong wipes the floor with all Monsterverse.
2:27 DANG did King Kong just punch the bad ape’s TOOTH out?!
Ima be full off wine and weed for this I can’t wait like literally drop it already
movie of the year
Was on the fence on whether I would enjoy this or not, then it got to "is that a MINI KONG???" I think i'll wait for it to be on streaming services.
Godzilla + Kong  What a powerful Combo
I can't believe it, tell me I'm dreaming....This is going to be Epic!
Filme realmente sera no Brasil slk
As we all know..   Apes strong..  together
1:43 absolute chills 😤😤
Ridiculous
Junk looks trash. GODZILLA (2014) was the only good one ngl
Enough with the bs human stories, we want to see the giants fight!
ty apes
IM A STEGASAURUS, Jesus return beginning 2019 as I had like three bun pins in my short hair like a Mohawk they called me a stegasaurus I was like ok whatever not knowing the nightmare I was in for. Anyways short haired chick looks really awkward… like not normal face.
I had a theory that probably shimu belonged to the scar king could it be the scar king owns him
Ok but you already saw Shimu 💀💀💀
So no Kurt Russel? 😢
Can't wait to see Kong and Godzilla do the Fusion dance to fight Shimu 🤌
Hollywood really has run out of ideas for movies. Yikes!
Wait 2 godzillas ?
So this is the film where Kong gets the title King most likely 🧐🧐🧐
tri-titan still solos
Warner Bros you have done a great job, i can't believe that mothra is coming back. If you guys didn't know mothra is in jia's eye
We got Godzilla with Super Sayan & Kingkong with Infinity Gauntlet before Gta6
My only hope is that Adam Wingard follows in his own footsteps with Godzilla v Kong, and doesn't focus too heavily on the human aspect of the movie. Just give us giant monsters fighting, with a sprinkle of human gobbledygook. I trust Wingard will deliver.
Noice
Aaahhh Yeeeaaaahhhhh!!!🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
So the deaf kid is now psychic?
YEAH BABY!!!!!!!
omg
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That is frightening but not because of the obvious.
Shimo: “Brrrrr ❄️”
0:31 Godzilla fighting shimo🔥🔥🔥in the right corner
No hay nada que llegar Watch
Quién es Chayanne semanas tres Wiener güey que estoy Space Ghost Callejas cursos de Zacatecas Raymond y cómo se llama
I hate the CGI  used in this movie. It looks like something from the scify channel
*I know one thing for sure this movie going to be one of best from2024*
Eles vão ir no brasilllll
Anjir ni final fight nya mah 2 vs 2 😂
Cuáles cosas extrañas
Kong give me goose and Gozilla give me bumps
I hope they focus on just a Godzilla film after this. And maybe a Kong film aswell. Itll be nice to just see godzilla in a solo film, same as kong.. but this is epic!
That left hook from Kong on scar king knocking out his teath is so satisfying
*Matatan.....(((".👀."))).....Ribirin H-S*
Ehh, would have made more sense to have them against another viable threat to the world other than a re colored protokong concept.  Now since Apex had Ghidorah's skull/DNA. And it was Allen Jonah (the antagonist from King of the monsters) who acquired it. And his group dealt in Titan DNA....... plus considering Godzilla being hurt mid combat A LOT. What would have made a better enemy would be a fusion of Ghidorah and Godzilla....... Space Godzilla...... But just a speculation on my part. And they might lead to that in future movies
Can’t believe it’s been nearly 3 years since the last one I cant wait for this
2:13 people pause and look really hard zoom in on the ice beam you can actually see shimu
If the ratio of monster to human scenes isn't at least 3:1, I'll be disappointed.
Trailer 0.30 seconds you can see Shimu, Godzilla kong and scar king battling
I cant wait for the movie!!
Nice
I CAME
Oh cool, another "girl that is the key to everything" character and crappy Marvelesque CGI. Just let the Japanese do kaiju movies please...
Did I see Mothras Mist at 2:37 ? <3
😐...why is Godzilla pink now!? 🤦🏻‍♀️😮‍💨
Can someone tell me what happen kong’s arm?
Like Minus One I'll see that movie but not for the same reason. This movie is more pop cornish and fun, Minus One was real cinema.
Rio de Janeiro❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
they need to never stop making these
Meh....looks like I'll set out for the high seas with this one😅
Did they turn BumbleBee into a glove for King Kong?
What a terrible CGI!! Gzus!! Looks bad to watch. How can Godzila minus one made with 15M be better then this made with 200M????
Cool doomfist release trailer
Kong > Godzilla
New toys from China at your local Walmart this coming Christmas! Please play responsibly.
It’s crazy the first one came out three years ago and now that we’re all in 2024 the sequel is here .
All hail the king
Godzilla got the kaiju universe skins
I know you all saw her, she is back 🦋
Man this is going to be huge... 😍😍👍 Good luck team 👍🎁😍💰💰
1:48 titanus shimo
GUYS, I cannot stress this enough. Do NOT look up Godzilla x Kong
Finally a well deserved Godzilla x Kong Movie
Kong got that hulk buster arm now :D
Lets goooo
All well and good until they slowly Segway it into the Pacific Rim Franchise and mess it all up
Or Kong got a Power Fist and Godzilla became a Mystic Deathclaw lol
I don't generally go in for giant monster movies, but I've gained an appreciation for America's embracing of the cheese, reminiscent of the old Godzilla movies. I enjoyed Minus one, this is on the other side of the spectrum; just having fun.
0:31  SHIMOOOOOO 1:53  SHIMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Looks like a video game.
Bro Godzilla decided to be Blue again for a second
I’m going to ask,how much was the budget for this movie, Godzilla Minus One  was 15 millions,lest see how many millions is better this one.
they will steal the skar toothkkkikkk
Idk but shimu reminds me of the King Titan from ark
@00:31 you can see two godzillas, a blue one and a pink one
They are hyping us up so much to the point that we are just gonna be waiting in line in theaters like it’s black Friday
Kong & Godzilla are awesome. Both make up for the terrible character writing in these movies. Still wish the characters were better, though.
So both Ghostbusters and godzilla got ice villans ? Huh 😅
Huh given the original presence of Ghidorah n the threat he posed to the planet I’m surprised that either Scar King or Shimo could scare Godzilla or King Kong
Were my guy Doug at???
Enough. Pathetic
So are they going to be fighting that red monkey or something else😅
Grotesque…
The thing I love is that every Godzilla movie Godzilla breaks a bridge😂
Anyone else see Mothra in her eyes
One word overstimulation.
I think kong beats scar king or is a stalemate and thats why shimo attacks
don't like the pink
this looks super turbo garbage lmao
GODZILLA VS SHIMU !!!!!!!
OH GOD!! trailer 2 is epic!
EVERYONE IF YOU LOOK AT 2:27 YOU CAN SEE SCAR KINH WAS HOLDING THE NEW BABY KONG IN A CHOKING WAY AND THEB KONG PUNCHED
Oh my god march 29😱😱😱😱😱♥️♥️♥️
WHOA🤯😶‍🌫️😁
WB kinda showed alot with this trailer
What even is this franchise now?
God and Kong on March, Deadpool and Wolverine in July 2024 is gonna be a fun year.
Rinse wash repeat... is the Art of Story Telling d3ad? Constant remakes and nothing new.
i think we sould name him kong thanose
When Hollywood copies from Bollywood.
Can't wait 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I want 2014 theme back..
Stop showing us too much!!!
Ohhhhhh I can’t wait for this masterpiece………..❤️🥹🫶🏽😅🌟🤍💫🔥
Shimu 2:13 zoom
Trailer shows WAY too much
Great film, I just saw the film in full.  The dialogues are great, what depth! Incredible story.
Sooooo stupid
Hype is real
Minuto 2:13 se ve shimu
0:30 If you pose at the right time, you can see... Mothra?
Kong got the infinity stones
💀💀💀💀💀🔥🔥🔥🚨🚨🚨🚨‼️‼️‼️‼️ Bro godzilla is NOT transformers ‼️‼️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
When did marvel and Godzilla have a crossover
Guess I gotta catch up on this series now too 👀
I don't care about Godzilla vs Kong I care about seeing coyote vs acme
When they showed shimo’s eyes with the music I got str8 chills😭
Espero el regreso de la reina de los monstruos 🦋✨
First Minus One and now New Empire.
Must be a remake of the man with the iron first
I can't wait to see that Movie!
OMG MOTHRAS BACK
Nah chill skar king
Мои глаза уничтодены.💀
It's like Planet of the Apes on roids!!😂😂😂😂
I think it's hilarious how I am deadset on seeing this movie because it looks like fun and also think Godzilla -1.0 was one of the best movies I've seen in a while.
This is Godzilla Minus Me
La wea mala
I'm so excited for this movie, right before my birthday in March 28th
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m still waiting for DOUG  WHERE IS HE I NEED TO KNOW HE WILL BE IN IT PLEASE
another movie I may or may not watch on the airplane ride
Lets gooooooo
shimo = ice godzilla
How can I watch another Godzilla movie after the epic Godzilla Minus One?? Give it a rest.
i think there are two different godzilla ?
no the rio de janeiro again, for god sake. leave us alone, we already got enought problems😂😂😂
where's kong's dong
Ohhh f@k!!!
Godzilla and Kong more powerful than ever before. This is going to be epic
this is  going super awesome
Godzilla is werrtho godzilla like thrmo godzilla
🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:27 🦷😂
I absolutely love the sheer self-indulgence that the Monsterverse is embracing. If Minus One was a perfect filet mignon, then GxK is a bag of chocolate dipped potato chips. And Im all here for it.
Peak
Gotta say this is looking epic
They really gotta stop adding to the human story line, we don’t care 😂😂
Why do they always fight
ice godzilla?
*Is this Planet of the Apes XXXL edition?*
I’m so hyped for this movie
Guys the dude that shot kongs axe was probably actually shimo bc it was like icy
Power fist
Kong the real King 👑
I need to see this, looks really good.
LETS GO, THE MOST MID MOVIE OF THE YEAR
They tried there best to hide shimo I’ll give em that , but u ain’t try hard enough 😭😂 2:27 pause at that very point in the trailer, and there’s your shimo 😂
Reminds me of godzilla's red beam attack from the 90's. Something you ain't telling us Legendary?
2:27 DANG did King Kong just punch the bad ape’s TOOTH out?!
Less human more monster!
Im going to the theater simply just to watch the gaunlet scenes
1:14 why does this sound like the charlie screaming meme
Minor augmentations, you say 💀
Poor scar came to know atlast his wrist belt useless and he lost one of his teeth for to much talk😂😂😂😂
They revealed to much this trailer 😂😂😂
I HOPE its Skar Kings. But anyways Kong did KO him one way or the other. Who knows, Skar King might become good and respect Kong, become his lieutenant or something lol.
Imagine TRANSFORMER × Godzilla × King Kong 😮😮
God damm😮😮 really can't wait ❤🎉
It looks stupid but I'm still going to watch it
In a world where movies struggle in the box office and continuously attempt to make a connected universe.  Somehow, the Godzilla franchise has been able to pull off both and keeps going.  I love this and I hope they keep making them.  I really hope we get to see Kong have his moment of triumph finally and hopefully sometime in the future we will get to see Biollante on the big screen!
This is awesome
Her short hair 🤢
YO THIS IS 🔥
2:27 that punch was hard from Kong ngl
Did I just see godzilla use thundershock ?....
The last time those two met up.... It was almost the ed of the kong... 🥵🥵💥
It’s gonna be hard for me to watch one of these again after now seeing Godzilla Minus One because that movie is what Godzilla should be and comparing it to this now is like night and day lol
This is BS,
The coolest thing about Godzilla is seeing his size in relation to our cities. When it seems like most of the movie takes place inside the center of the earth (which is dumb enough on it's own) the size has nothing to be compared too. Like at 1:30 these could just as well be normal sized apes fighting you'd never know the difference.
Godzilla x Kong: Public Enemies.
THIS MOVIE BOUTTA BE FIRE
What was that monster with the blue eyes n the shadows?! I thought the main boss was scar king
this is gonna be so tuffffffffffff
Looks CG
How in 2024 is this the big budget Hollywood film??? 😂😂😂
I get a goosebumps every time I see godzilla.. Loving this series of movies.. 🎉
They are literally using the prowler sound lol
Apes strong together!
Rush hour 5
Stop please
This is confusing

#SaveCoyoteVsAcme

#SaveCoyoteVsAcme #SaveCoyoteVsAcme #SaveCoyoteVsAcme #SaveCoyoteVsAcme
#SaveCoyoteVsAcme
😮😮😮
#SaveCoyoteVSAcme (please Warner Bros.!)
This looks like so much fun! I can't wait.
Are there comics or movies or anything I can watch to catch up on the Monster verse?
Another King Kong and Godzilla?? Hollywood really has no creativity whatsoever smh
Oh My God!! TRAILER EPIC!!
Amazing!!!!
YESSS SECOND TRAILER!!!
Nah I just want kong to defeat Godzilla, the previous movie just made kong weak asf
These Titans are on crack and are going to fight furious george
Jia’s visions remind me of Miki Saguesa
skar king is very coolest titan in the monsterverse and also shimo like them both
If you giving Kong a gauntlet just give him a iron man suit 💀
Looks good but i prefer godzillas blue colered atomic brath and spikes
I'm glad they're keeping the mystery kaiju close to the vest although I'm almost sure I know who it is
Wow, the new planet of the apes movie looks amazing
My little boy is a huge, *huge* Godzilla fan.  He has watched the original in subtitles.  He cannot wait for this movie.  I hope it's everything he wants it to be.
Who is shilmo
THIS FILM WILL BE A SUCCESS AT THE BOX OFFICES.
GenZilla: pink puke edition
Can’t wait
This movie will be epic
Question? Are there comment bots in here?
Shimo giving Kong frostbite is W
Who is excited for this movie? This movie is going to be awesome and I can’t wait to see titan shimo this is going to be the best movie ever in the monsterverse
Can’t wait for Godzilla to rizz up shimu after they free her from skar king’s control.
Rated R for Real dumb movie
So basically Godzilla acquires super Saiyan Rose form and Kong becomes a megazord 💀
Next movie humans create the first Jaegers to fight alongside Zilla and Kong.
Details in this trailer on top 💀🔥
Looks absolutely ridiculous/silly.  100% will watch/enjoy.
Omg we're finally getting monsters fighting with good visibility. Finally studio knows why we watch
2:52
Digger, was für ein Quatsch. Schau lieber mal Shin Gojira von Hideaki Anno. Das hier ist lächerlich 🥲
Another one?
I haven’t been hyped for a movie in a minute this is going to be good
You know what I think since Kong killed mechagodzilla in the last film I think it’s only fair that Godzilla should kill scarking don’t you think
Am I the only one noticing that scarking whip is the remains of a Warbat skeleton
You know what I think scarking reminds me of bayverse the fallen from transformers revenge of the fallen
Godzilla looks crazy🔥🔥🔥
Brazilians seeing these 4 titans fight on their city:BOM DIA,CARTERA E CELULAR
Calling it. SPACE GODZILLA
Wait but where are the transformers and the family from Fast.  If we're making stupid, explodey, epic music movies, i want to have all of the stupid, explodey, epic music goodness.
*Warner Brothers must release a hard core pornographic version of Godzilla and King Kong with the others including every species on Earth to prove love* - 12:06 pm Pacific Standard Time on Thursday, 15 February 2024
why does this look even worse than a videogame? XD
Here we go, the new and original movie Godzilla x Kong. Big innovation!!
Mfs saying the CGI is bad are tweaking. This movie looks beautiful. I really wanna see what’s going on with Godzilla and his new power. It’s look so badass and I can’t wait. From the looks of it he seems to be normal at first in the movie and then get his pink power
finally a good movie
Primal Rage Arcade game
Kong is just missing a set of T51B to go with that Power Fist.
The fact that we are seeing Godzilla and Kong teaming up before we even get GTA 6 is wild.
YO THIS IS FIRE!!!!!!!!!!! IM READY FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Godzilla running hmmmm ok
its goin fire man ... damn
Kong become Winter soldier 😂
Godzilla x Kong The new empire of the rise of the planet of the apes of the infinity war.
I wish they put it on HBO Max I miss watching new movies at home
Grisha: Zeke, is that you ?  No, I'm Skar king now....
Unwatchable. Completely ridiculous.
2:43 Dr Monkey strange vs godzilla buster kong vs  scarlet godzilla 😂
They have to have to put doug in the movie
Now if they can just integrate Pacific Rim into this😎👊🏽
Falta que lo saquen en español latino
Mothra spotted in the reflection of an eye during vision scene ✊
Now this is a movie I wanna watch at the theatre
people are saying its dumb looking , but your not giving it credit for how enteraining this looks and thats what cinema is all about some times a fun rollercoster ride . so give GXK its credit ,  godzillas a 70 year old franchise its done everything and its no dumber than a time travling in a phone box , samurai space wizards or people flying in spandex.
Mecha. Kong
Cant wait to see this movie, this will be a ride
While I am looking forward to this movie, I do hope we get to see Destroyah in the near-ish future.
🫵😒 the first Godzilla actor back
Super far fetched  but Space zilla better show up.
What was in the cave???
The thing I'm wondering is how would all the other Kong's react when Godzilla shows up.
1st kong got stole thanos guantlet. 2nd godzilla stole super saiyan power. 3rd darth vader named the movie.
Man said don’t swallow your tongue then flys into the middle of the ocean 😂
Hmmm - another 2 hour movie of badly rendered CGI throwing skyscrapers at each other! 🥱
2:27 shimo face reveal 😂
I'm curious how Kong and Godzilla communicate with each other
Everyone is taking about Kong and Godzilla, but how has no one talked about SHIMO, shouldn't he be the main villain? HE'S VICIOUS!
Yo who made Lanky kong a titan
When Kong puts on the glove, the noise it makes sounds like the opening of the main theme of King Kong Vs. Godzilla (1962)  2:43
The most boring franchise no one cares about
2:22 tom Hiddleston is back ?
coookkkkkkkk
Godzilla have a ice freezing powers 😍😍😍😍
They need cash Eli On Here 😂
This looks amazing
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kong better smoke that punk!
This movie will be very awesome 👍
transformers?!
watf 😮
Saying big fella scared don’t even sound right
GODZILLA Inter Miami 😎🤙
There is no way godzilla is still attacking Kong 😂
Sooooooo there's another godzilla titan??
Wow 9m views this is gona be something here
Dude. Im gonna cry when monsterverse ends. This is a masterpiece
Godzilla and Kong scared of a titan that created the ice age?? Now I definitely need to see this in theaters
It seems like they decided to change the white guy for a witty dude that crack jokes
Im ready to see this movie
bored of these series
Stupid movie no sense
What if Godzilla has absorbed a negative power source and it has mind warped him which is why he's attacking Kong again and has the pinkish glow.🤔 OR What if Godzilla was hibernating, Shimo stumbles upon him, slowly freezes him and feeds off his energy, draining Godzilla's energy causing the pinkish glow and diet Godzilla 🤔
Jeszcze trochę A king kong będzie tanosem a godzilla będzie latac strzelać laserem z dupy. Co onii zrobili z nimi to nwm
Look and learn dear Marvel Studios
This looks stupid. GLORIOUSLY stupid. But it still looks stupid. :)
Watching King Kong and Godzilla run into battle side by side gives me chills every time

so whats the enemy their fighting?
CGI is trash
Here we go
What’s the difference between this and Godzilla minus one
after watching Godzilla minus one, I cant be hyped by this..
will mechagodzilla be in the movie
shimu is so big
Godzilla fan assemble here 👇
I just hope they focus less on humans this movie
This is a 100000000000000000000000000000000/10 oh my god is there going to be TWO GODZILLAS?????????????? I can't wait of the move it's like mechagodzilla and godzilla fighting in Hong Kong in GVK 🎉🎉 THIS IS THE BEST THANKS ❤  gxk ❤❤
This is becoming a cartoon.  I liked the first Godzilla, it was more serious and more realistic movements from the characters. They move to fast and they act like cartoons now.  Are they purposely ruining their franchise?
use < >  in keypad to go Frame by frame, it looks awesome
The Kong with the Iron Fist.
Can't wait
So , how does kong team up with Big G.... Kong- Yo , broo there's a new super powers loaded freeza of Kaiju in the hood..... Plus im busy fighting another jungle book monke coz i m gonna be king of the planet of apes with my sick new transformers x infinty war gauntlet.... If you can't beat this we're all doomed anyway .....we gonna beat this with the power of anime and friendship..... Godzilla - I better unlock MUI before destroyah shows up
There are too many issues there😭😭
This is year is going to be fun ❤😊
Is this fake?
Pov: you misclicked
Godzilla went from base to ssjb and now ssjr and kong turned into thanos man this film is going to be a meme
2:30 His nuclear pulse is back baby! It's been 29 years since Godzilla charge up his Nuclear pulse at the end of Heisei era. Thank You Legendary.
If I want to work in your film what to do sir
This is about to be One of the best movies I ever see in my life
The amount of work the directors and film crew puts on these kinds of films is insane❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Kon kon probo se aaya hai wiev dekhne😂
Why Godzilla is having infinity stones 😂
❤❤
“जिसने भी खुद को खर्च किया है, दुनिया ने उसी को Google पर Search किया है।”
0:35 can relate. Same here, Jia 😂  Also, what in the fkn super smash bros is goin down at 0:30 😮 guess we'll find out soon enough.
Happy 300 subscriber 🎉 support please ❤❤❤
O rio de janeiro ta no filme pessoal 😎😎😎😎
Ridiculous
Don't reveal too much about your secret character .let us go look at the factory
How tf do they keep figuring out ways to milk every last drop out of things If they put half as much effort into a new concept we'd have a banger on our hands
I’m more than ready for this 😂
This looks okay, I was hoping they would bring in different type of monster instead of another monkey
We neeeed a godzilla game
This movie looks soooo incredibly stooopid.  Cant wait.
Owesome mind blowing 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Its extremely important to support this movie in the theater.
2:33 😮 whaaaaaaaaaaa?!
Just give him the Hulkbuster already 😅
Bawal hai super duper
Excited 😅
Broke got the infinity gauntlet!!!!!!!!!!
CANT WAIT!
If they don't do the human characters right, just take them out of the movie. We're not here to see them anyway!
I just hope we eventually get Gamera in the monsterverse so we can have a canon remake of the death battle
This is like giving a 12-year-old 200 mil
Ahh finally a trailer that gives me goosebumps.
Looks like a TRANSFORMERS-movie. The first KONG X GODZILLA was pretty much like a Michael Bay-TRANSFORMERS-movie.
Wow that lightning pulse from Godzilla was Insane!
Op🤌
Why must you spoil everything in the trailer
Omg we're finally getting monsters fighting with good visibility. Finally studio knows why we watch
My wife calls my whoop baby Kong
Romance 😂
if yall are gonna make Godzilla run like a human, let him dap up Kong the same way
Still Dissapointed they didn’t have actual Godzilla monsters for the villains
😃👏
Baby Kong = Scrappy Doo
Hindi ma kab aayga trailer 2
Godzilla minus one is leagues ahead of this cartoonish drivel.
Thank you, Jason Eisener, for being responsible for giving the big monke an iron fist.
And then Next Kaiju and Pacific Rim merge... 😂😅
Ok i like this kong and godzilla arent friends being two alpas just contemporaries
Hear me out. Godzilla will dave Little Kong
I am so ready for this
MOTHRA IS RETURNING!!! Hopefully not just a vision 😭
LETS GOOOO
God these movies are just animated through and through bring back the skillfull film makers who use practical effects and sets please
Shimu is confirmed
100% not invested in any of this.
Kong
This one’s gonna be epic
Malti vars  of  mad nes
2:27 I think bro got mad 💀
Movie finna be good asf
Wow this took a really big f*cking turn.
KRATOS KING KONG
Let them Fight!
When he says the signal is a call for war.Reminds me of Shang Chi post credit scene there is a signal
I am totally on board for this film, but afterward, I think I'd like it if the MonsterVerse had films centered around monsters besides the two kings. There's an entire roster they can choose from.
Kong and godzilla friendship like goku and vegeta
my nikka paperboy is here
The couple we all want
2:2.6 scence anyone have seen  shimo's face on right side corner
Fire
Not gonna lie, we are going to witness the epic saga of the monster universe, for sure.
I'm really exited to see Mothra and interested to see Fosphera.
It was shimu I knew it that glacy white eyes was shimu
This looks epic.
So sick wtf
Omgggg so excited guys
What this monkey 🐒 doing in sab sahara?
So Scar king recruits Shimu the ice queen to fight against humanity and bring ice age back then our little girl hero with Kong convinces Shimu to stop the attack and give second chance to humanity. Scar King gets beaten at the end and either dies or retreats. Is that the whole movie summary? Am i missing something?
Planet of the apes
Something even Godzilla and Kong are afraid of? Okay, now it just got real!  2:28 - Good luck putting that thing under your pillow tonight. Damn!
OMG two Godzilla.....guys look blue Godzilla size and pink Godzilla size was different
Godzilla X Kong is wrong Godzilla + Kong is correct  Actually this is what going to happen I think so😂
LFG!!!!!!!!!😳🥹😂😁😄🙃😇
This looks like trash
2:13 "Jesus wants a hug"
Kong and godzilla vs skar King and Shimu
Its official!! The founding titan Shimu is in the movie 🎉
Thank u trailer, i know the story now
Vi and Viktor but they’re giant beasts
I have never seen so much garbage in 3:03 minutes
Honesty the Godzilla/kong universe is the goofiest thing ever and I’m all for it
Personally i like Godzilla more in comparison of any other
Another crows zero sequel
Planet of the Apes x Jurassic Park x Pacific Rim Job
I'ma keep it a buck fifty with y'all. I don't even care about the plot, I just like seeing giant monsters fight😂
make new villain dude.

Ooooooh we don’t have to like each other we just have to work together hahahaha. They’re not even hiding the propaganda
these movies are so trash, it's like a 6 year old fighting himself with a toy in each hand
Ye lya dikha diya 🫀🫀🫀
Kong's really out here fighting skar king and shimo at the same time in the hollow earth
We wuz kongz
Amazing 😍😍😍😍
Oh yea, lets give Kong a Power Glove..... so freaking dumb
Awesome
Kon kon probo pe pase laga raha ha
Chills! 🔥
Why every big fights happens in Egypt...🤔
Bang bang💥
*Warner Exec* "This movie needs more EDI points!"    *FX Team* "How 'bout a pink Godzilla?"   *Warner Exec* "I like it!"
2:13 oh god If they destroy the statue of Jesus And someone which I thought as well in my head a joke The city in chaos People: What can we do!? Oh Jesus save us! Old man: Yeah! Jesus will save us! Jesus statue destroyed  Get the reference
Everyone just going to ignore the fact that one of the camels magically disappeared in the beginning of the trailer? 😅lol
i’m sorry but if you aren’t hyped for this movie then you aren’t a true monster movie fan. I said it! 😂
I think that scene where Kong meets Shimu is when he loses the axe and gets his hand busted. Showing even Godzilla’s dorsal plate can’t block Shimu’s power and hence why he evolves to SSJ 3 🤣
I wish Adam Wingard would make something like You're Next or The Guest again...
Thee anaipu thurai saarbaga padam vetri adaya vaalathukiren
Rip the cgi
They thought they were slick putting mothra in there for two frames. But we saw it.
OMG! Shimu !!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
No, not the pyramid!
at 0:28 if u slow it down u can see godzilla fighting shimo
If you are still wandering who will win Godzilla or Kong you have your answer 2:16 - 2:22
Maybe instead of giving us these 200 million garbages, give 20 million to 10 directors from around the world and let them direct Godzilla movies.
Hahahaha, I got it completely wrong!! Hey I still believe them fighting Bumble Bee and Space Godzilla is BETTER, Skar King and Shimo.. never heard of them!! Ha ha, no but seriously this movie looks pretty good so far from this trailer!
Absolutely jumped the shark. This looks embarassing.
This looks so dumb. I absolutely love it. Can't wait.
Godzilla running is hilarious
Yep this movie is gonna be better than Minus One👍
Bawal
CGI looks very bad
That was teeth. I thought it was crab leg 😅
Awesome...
1:51 Kong's reaction is crcazy
Is that furious George fighting Kong with the infinity gauntlet???
I hope Biolante is next.
Putasos putasos. No nos metan historias humanas
Okay my second guess is they're fighting Bumble Bee from The Transformers movies?! That makes no sense to me, are they doing a cross over film?
Is it just me or that skar kings cgi is a bit pore
i don’t understand why it always have to be a death person or kid
Too much details for a trailer
Blue thermonuclear godzilla!!1!111!
looks good
bro got turned into doomfist
wow
What is this Transformers X Godzilla X Avengers
Who are they fighting here in this trailer? Is that Space Godzilla?! I haven't seen Space Godzilla.. since The Toho Studio's Japanese Film Godzilla Vs. Space Godzilla (1994)! I hope this is a good movie.. but I might not even watch it. I don't know about where I stand with it.
Yup shimu is here
Orange hair ape has blue eyes & a slave whip 🤨
Mammals vs lizard people.
In this trailer, there are two best scenes, truly epic; When Kong fully terrified while watching the Shimu for the first time and the second one is Godzilla coming out from the earth, roaring and running.
Thats amazing
0:31 shimu çok uzun
*watch together or regret alone*
Is that shemu!!!?
O like  and i win 😎
The way kong punch skar king
I’m 100% watching this on IMAX. This movie is what movie theaters were made for.
Why is this so good
I think Godzilla and kong will have conflicts again 😂
best
"Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked."
I don't like my own comments
All the best 😀
This made me really emotional! I can’t wait!

This is just shame for Godzilla.
Viva godzilla
Godzilla: Rgb ligth Kong: Infinity gauntled
Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be epic.
"and I am King Kong" Snaps his fingers*
Comments is the best way to see the spoilers 😌
2:25
This looks great, I can't wait to watch it on the big screen
This is pure and peak cinema ❤🔥
Ok that looks pretty good
Goosebumps

0:31 Hold up..wait a minute whats that scar king doing to kong💀
There's NOTHING more CINEMATIC than the MONSTERVERSE
How come humans be fooled by a lie, illusion so-called movie 😂😂😂
Imagine telling your boss a tooth fell on your car, I won't be able to make it to work today... 😅🥲🤣
0:31 godzila is fight with a ice dragon
Cheesiest trash ever! Take my money I freaking love this.
Kong with the powerfist before GTA 6
Scar king longer thinner arms remind me of beast titan from attack on titan 💪
Whoa whoa whoa are you telling me that the gman can use nuclear pulse at will now😮!!!!
I'd rather watch Deadpool
Is that shimu brust? 1:56
Even Brazil is in the middle of this film, this is very good
Man I just wanna see some monsters fighting and this is it. DAMN THIS WILL BE AWESOME!
Rise of the Planet of Kong.  Guest starring Godzilla
Bro it’s either Godzilla jr or another godzilla (space godzilla)
Really the thing behid is VS this & VS this Need something different bro
SPACE GODZILLA!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So its Godzilla that got hypnotized huh not the 4th Titan
I know it’s going to be a very dumb plot and insufferable cringe human stuff, but I do want to see big monke and radioactive lizard vs bigger monke
Trash
Kong and Godzilla vs skinny red monkey they are afraid of....what?
lol more Pacific Rim 2 than pacific rim 2 was 😮
This was a better trailer.
Kong fan
PINK COOLZILLA
King Kong ain't playing with Scar King. 🦍🆚🦧
Looks like a piece of parc
😶‍🌫🥸🥸
Shimo appearances  0:30 battle vs. godzilla  1:53 fire cave 2:13 standing on ice 2:27 beside Scar King
About time for a hybrid now like a God Kong or Kingzilla 🤷🏾‍♂️
Nice
Now that's what we were asking for 🔥🔥
Yeahhhhhhh
Ankara Kong ankara Kong goal goal goal
KONGos the titan and Super saiyan GODzilla rosé...
“Your new empire?!!”
"The last time those two met up, it was almost the end for kong" they'll never forget who the best kaiju is
Does this stupidity never ends ??
Kya bawaal chiz bana diya ho WB WALO .....
1:52 WTF???
Now that's what I'm talking about ❤
2:27 if he punched skar king with the beast glove, skar king would have died 😭
No way scar king the final boss
Why does shimu looks like godzilla but blue?
Kong's gone Winter Soldier 😅
I want DCU revive again❤❤
Hearing Godzilla's Atomic breath charge is a sound i could listen to for the rest of my life and never get tired.
Why is Godzilla two different colors?  One minute he’s pink, the next it’s blue, I’m not sure if this is a gender reveal or what.
There are not 2 Godzilla’s ! Godzilla has a new form which is the pink form we see now before us he went into the ice too evolve too help Kong fight shimo and the skull king
Wait a minute, is there another Godzilla? Because in the beginning, his scales were pink, and when he fired an explosion in his body, his scales became blue. Is this another Godzilla, or is this one of Godzilla's new abilities? Also, there was a monster behind a waterfall.
I can't believe that with only $15 Million, the Japanese managed to make better effects than this! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
The Monster Verse 🔥
We want King Kong, not just Kong
Can you make this movie free
wtf i’m understanding there is two gozilla
Godzilla had seen mothra get exploded so he went Super Saiyan Rosè and Kong went to Endgame and stole The Gauntlet from Thanos Definitely Best Kajiu Movie of 2024
Film released date ?
0:30 there 2 godzillas? one doing the blue pulse and a pink one fighting shimo
Artic iguana vs water iguana and bald monke vs chunky monke. That's a good plot
Not me warbling
Is there like comic books like tell what happens between movies?
The iron fist Beast 👍👍👍👍👍👍
😮😮 Amazing
What happened to the pink godzilla?
Rise of the planet of the apes from the centre of the earth.
Ive had enough of the Hollywood garbage. Now, take my money.
Definitely,the movie will be average one.
Godzilla running something i didn't expect to see while I am alive 😢😢😢
From the hacks that brought you Fox X-Men…?
2:12  I saw SHIMO FIRING HIS BEAM
Nice
GODZILLA MINUS ONE
Gaint guantlet ✨✨✨
Waiting waiting waiting
I notice Kong gets the cask from blocking that freeze blast with his battle axe in this trailer
So they gonna fight zeke, i bet eren is waiting in the post credit scene.
Godzilla and kong the most iconic duo
When it will going to be released love from India
Enga annanaala...pesa mudiyathu... Enga Anna naala keka mudiyathu...😂😂😂
Godzilla 🐊
SUCH A NEW EMPIRE 😱
Why does shimu looks like godzilla but blue?
My fvourite gecko  is back  #kaboom😄
Why does shimu looks like godzilla but blue?
Alright, who turned Bumblebee into the Infinity Gauntlet?
Congratulations for this trailer.
We are waiting for u..action kong
Paul scaring a Bene Gesserit at 2:06 is incredible. But 1:27 - 1:37 is beautiful!
Idc for the plot, but his...is going to be epiiiiiic
The fact that the first 23 hours just made 8.3M views for the new trailer is outstanding
forever teamGodzilla!!!!
2:27 face
This is what I live for
Super cartoon 😅
2:27 Punch on skar king’s face n teeth flying out seems to be personal. Pause and see at 2:51 kong has his new sharp canine implants.
We just want Godzilla AWM in next Premium Create 😅 PUBG Lover assemble here 😅
Kong got the infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved super Saiyan Rose this is gonna be epic 3:03
When they gonna run outta things to destroy?
Oh I thought that in one hand, Kong will be wearing that Transformer's infinity gauntlet thing and in the other would be pink axe charged by MUE (Mastered Ultra Ego) Godzilla... Well jokes apart, really hyped to watch it in the mall🎉
This sells it as an action movie a lot better than that first trailer, but it's still incredibly stupid and embarrassing. I can't wait!
so epic
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
0:31  yoooo guys I saw this scene is look like’s godzilla gonna fight shimu and kong gonna fight scar king😮😮😮 look at the scene closely
i just wish a movie WITHOUT humans! this is boring! titans fighting is not a reason to involve HUMANS! 🤡
This movie sounds annoying and looks awful.
Only godzilla can make pink look that scary
Ab aayega mja 🎉🎉🎉
Marvelous
The atomic Godzilla is back 🔥
Rather watch Madame Web🥱
It's something more than mad is coming on to the screen🤯
CGi looklike animation 😅😂
Why they run like a human
U CAN SEE SHIMU VERY WELL GO AT SECOND 31
Damn This one will be epic
someones been playing fallout 4 with that power fist!
Its just me or the CGI look bad?
The guardians of ... The protectors of... The rise of... (yawn)
Bruh now Kong is fighting Kun-Fu.... The F is going on??? What about to Ape fight and Godzilla monster fight
This is actually incredible like the detail to the fear on kongs face is crazy. Far superior to anything marvel has put out since 2019
I hope Kong and Godzilla with work together as a team.
As the fraud scarking stuck back in fear godzilla began to open up his domain and said stand proud scar u r strong 2:32
Can't wait to see it's just 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I already know this might my favorite movie
The love for this trailer shows that we all have awakened our inner child. On March 29th we will have our dinner please. I mean inner peace 😇
This looks BEYOND ridiculous and I can't wait to see it
Aaaaaaaaa es demasiado epicoooo
WHY NOT GAVE KONG A WAKANDA'S SUIT . So that he can more resistant from attack
0:30 Mothra in girl's eye.
Zilla > Kong. Period.
epic!!!!
Por qué tan oscura ? 😢
Mja aagya 😮😮😮😮
Massss 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is what we wanted from Warner Bros ... No words to about this.. my heart is waiting for March 29 ..❤
This is so dumb😂😂😂I like it
Dam 🔥🔥
Damn..Legendry.. Monsterverse at its peak 🔥🔥🔥🔥
SHIMUUUUUU
For one ticket, you can watch Transformer, King Kong and Planet of the Apes! YESSS!!!!
oh no, its a marvel crossover
Great. Another child as the center of the movie. And turning the Kaijus into some tag team heros instead of scary extinction level monsters.
Kong stole iron man’s gauntlet and Godzilla powered up saiyan mode 😂 this movie going to be a vibe
I'm a big fan of the Monster Verse, but they're getting carried away with this CGI and character enhancements.
So it’s the best titan x ape duo of all time for the best of today? fair enough.
කබර ගොරිලි සටන 😶
Fakkk.. kong ft godzilla defeating kingdom of apes
It's like monster pro wrestling and I love it!  Godzilla and Kong were enemies but found common ground and learned to peacefully coexist. Now they are in a tag-team match against someone they couldn't fight on their own. And I get the feeling Godzilla has evolved somehow.  I know we saw him sleeping amid that pink energy before.  I wonder if it somehow rejuvenated him.  Like he's back at his peak and with a new kind of energy powering him.  Maybe that's how he's moving so fast.
Wow. It looks like in some scenes the Titans actually have some weight on them. Which never bothered me that they had fast movement in previous movies, just seemed like they listened to some fans who were complaining about the movement.
Looks great but you should have just stuck with the 1st.
1 word "Awesome"
1:38 Scar king be BALLIN
It will be Shimo vs Godzilla while Kong take care of the King monkeh
That tooth is bigger than my 1bhk apartment 😂...
Everyone got a Dejavu from seeing this trailer or is it just me? when Kong go to another world i feel like i have already see this film somewhere...
1:15  When you nut but She still keep sucking
Looks like the leaks were true!
That villan roar music is literally a goosebumps ❤💥
This is the first trailer in my life where I have to pause the video multiple times to realise how great it is.....🔥🔥🔥
monke
while it looks good, don't think we forgot about Coyote vs Acme
i see ice there is one titan who can use ice that i know so far
Goosebumps 🔥
Gawd this is so dumb. I’m sure it’ll be fun but damn this is dumb. I miss KOTM
Godzilla x kong😍😍 Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Some might complain saying the movie is getting more "action hero"-ish rather then serious kaiju horror and is far from what the original was. But I'd say they are somewhat faithful, the original started as kaiju horror before they started making it more "action hero"-ish with some comedy, having Godzilla pull off silly wrestling stunts and whatnot. Althought not all the japanese godzilla movies were like that though.
ABSOLUTAMENTE LOCURA!!!!!
Truly a Hollywood movie of all time as the kids would say
The Showa era is back! Make Godzilla do a drop kick!
Looks like 2 hours of videogame cutscenes
I’M SO EXCITED, THE MOVIE IS ONE MONTH AWAY
Looking like Karan Arjun is back to action ❤❤
Godzilla Rumble 💀
متى موعد عرض الفلم
Amo esta saga 🥹❤️
lemon and tangerine?
What a blast 🙌🏻
😮
I'm excited, but I'm not feeling the visuals completely and I HATE THE IDEA OF THEM RUNNING!!! Please don't ruin this., the monsterverse has been very good so far
Must watch in theatres
W🔥
Jwldi comment kwrdetahu like milengge❤❤
Is Power 👊👊
2:50 *CHAOTIC* +PARRY    (If yk yk)
Looks like fun!  Any chance of Mothra making an appearance, do you think?
Ohhh Transformer
op
Atomic lizard, great ape and i'm instant rock-hard.
কং তুমি এগিয়ে চলো  গর্জিলা আছে তোমার সাথে 😊
Monke yesss
So anyways, when are getting a Godzilla Minus One sequel?
This movie will be such a movie of 2024 that we will not be able to skip even for 1 second. And you will not get bored of watching it every time you watch it.
Yes i am hyped, but where is milly bobby brown
King Kong should  come in the planet of the apes 😂😆😁
He won’t be alone- chills
Yep sign me up,I am all in
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lot better than Adipurush
We should not condone 🦍 on 🦍 violence.
kong got Infinity Gauntlet & apes side movies is looks like Planet of apes bigger version :) & Barbie Godzilla 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 on destruction
Ahh this is what I been waiting for And I get to see it on the big screen again
Why does the roar of the godzilla sounds like moist critical scream
Godzilla CGI  is SOOO bad. i mean soo bad. he is as shinny and unattractive as suicide squad killed the justice league game.
At 2:13 Look closely...Shimo is shooting Frost Beam high up in the troposphere probably causing FREEZING RAIN....Skar KIng Standing on the backshore Hill.....and the mother of all detailing.....the Statue of Christ the Redeemer arms having icicles.
2024 blockbuster movie 🎉🎉🎉
Its even worse then the old ones
Share kro
I’ve wanted to love these movie but as they go on they get worse and worse. Especially after Godzilla Minus One crushed it.
They should said in that Trailer that Scar king is not the Only Treat, to get u more interested.
Not sure about this....1) they need to leave Jordan Vought Roberts in charge of this universe (Kong Skull Island) 2) get rid of the B list actors and focus on Kong/Godzilla only.
What in the avengers infinity war and rise of the planet of apes is this? 😂
This is just INSANITY! I LOVE IT! I actually got chills Godzilla and Kong running in this trailer than the first one. 😁
Whaaattttttttt 🤯🤯🤯
We are here and not going anywhere
letsgoooooo tidak sabar menunggunya
Huh so this really is just Transformers now
Next movie Godzilla weds Kong
Can't wait😅
Godzilla❤Kong
good lord, this happens when transformers meets pacific rim.
Why they gotta give Godzilla that tiny lil' pinhead?
Getting a bit ridiculous now, if that's even possible...
bangerrrrrrrrrrrr
2:27 o shimo aparece do lado do scar king
Are you guys as pumped as I am... GOD DAMN my heart is beating. Can't wait !! Let's goo
🤣🤣🤣
Yo there's two different Godzillas
I really like kong...!   Please don't make me disappoint ❤❤
Childish Film ever 🤡
Why does the godzilla roar sound like penguin0 yelling "woooooo" and clipping the audio here XD GIMME THAT CLASSIC LEATHER GLOVE ON A CELLO ROAR
I love how they are trying to cover up as much as possible for shimo to not spoil the design reveal
Kong and Godzilla Roar + BGM + Visual Effects = Theatre Will be 🔥
Cringe.
Another Big monkey movie, with horrible human characters.
Kong looking like roman reigns. lets hope he does the super man punch in this one😂
30:00 you can see shimo
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bowser x Donkey Kong:                                               The New World (2105)
This looks beyond stupid. I'm so in.
I can't wait to see 👀THIS  movie 🎥 with my grandma
They’ve reached Toho levels of absurdity and I’m all for it
This looks like it is goong to be one EPIC movie!!!
At last kong will become an Iron Man 😊
This Kingdom of the planet of the apes looking good.
Just meeeeh
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Bro Godzilla has a same power as Sonic from Sonic The Hedgehog Movie 2020 2:31
Kya bawaal chiz hai bhai , ek bandar aur chipkali ki tag team 👏😶‍🌫️
2:27
ek kaam karo puri movie hi yaha release kardo
Epic. The sound effects alone sold me on this one!
Finally a good movie comming😭😭😭
more destruction!!!!!!!
Seeing Godzilla run ruined it for me. I don't believe he'd be able to run very fast on those legs.
The Monster Verse has jumped the shark. This looks ridiculous.
Bro I can’t wait to see shimo in action
When the big lizard go rawr my brain do a happy
Kong's punch is always personal.
Uff🔥🔥🔥
aint no way theres a frost godzilla
Ok but when we getting space godzilla
Kong abandoned stormbreaker for a gauntlet without gems.
😳 what is this
A gauntlet. Wonder where they got that idea from?
Now this is awesome
I can’t believe Its official shimu is appearing
This has to be the dumbest movie ever. Glad everyone is gonna waste their money on this garbage of a movie. And the CGI is so crappy looking. Dont get me started on Kong having the infinity gauntlet. Clearly the writers have no idea what to do with Godzilla and King Kong.
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Yeah I just personally only liked skull island for a fun action/adventure horror monster flick. Idc really about the king vs Godzilla city destroying films, don’t really do anything for me personally. But it looks fun for a day if I’m bored and just wanna watch something to just shove popcorn in my mouth for 2 hours and turn my brain off.
I really need to know what these script writers are taking
Waiting..........❤
Is Shimu making his appearance?
2:27 u can see shimu's head at corner..2:26 shimu's tail in left corner of beach
A pink Godzilla😂😂😂...Hollywood died after Endgame foreal. These feminists and Alphabet gang ruined EVERYTHING
Godzilla’s real name is Leviathan  Kong’s real name is Behemoth
Dawg….i can’t wait
Me gusta cuando Godzilla revela al mundo su pene de 100 metros, aguanta Shimu...
Dammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmn!!!!!
ಟ್ರೈಲರ್ ಖತರ್ನಾಕ್ ಐತಿ... ❤ ಮೂವಿ ನೋಡಬೇಕಾಗುತ್ತದ
Godzilla ssj rosé
Casting in these movies is always substandard
Feels kinda Todd that Godzilla already solo’d Gidora, but then they’re still fighting pretty basic kaiju
Does anybody notice the shimo face... It's like a turtle in 2:27 play the vedio in slow motion
Wow keren banget nih 👍👍👍❤ Good luck
0:30 - Mothra does lay an egg after coming to life somewhere, so pretty sure she's back now after KOTM (and maybe the reason for the pink transformation too)
WHAT A MIN . You tellin me shimo is CALLIN both of them niggas for the smoke !!! And this is false advertising the person wit enough balls to scare Godzilla ain’t been born yet
Team Godzilla 🔥❤
Why do trailers still do that thing where they spoil the entire movie’s progression?
Kong punched scar scene is best for me, I have replayed it like 5 times now, that should be a K.O 😂
See the condition of  Hindus in Pakistan Afgan Bangladesh 🇵🇰🇧🇩 Pakistan 23% to 1% Bangaldesh 33% to 7% Afgan 0% .

❤Amazing🔥
Americans pushes Kong infront always, whereas Godzilla lives in the heart of audience❤
Que película mas pelo-tuda....
this … doesn’t look good what are yall on about ??? Monarch had better CGI than this 😭 the story SOUNDS dope on paper, but i’m sure it’ll be executed in traditional hollywood fashion lol. please just give me a Mothra live action film :/
i spy with my little eye a person saying i spy with my little eye a person saying i spy with my little eye a person saying i spy with my little eye a person saying i spy with my little eye a person saying i spy with my little eye a person saying i spy with my little eye a person saying i spy with my little eye a person saying i spy with my little eye a person saying i spy with my little eye a person saying this comment won’t get more then 5 likes
I really thought that pink color was gonna be used by Space-Godzilla in future movies, but having our boy with it seem really cool too ngl
millie is not here but its fine
India release date
Very nice 😮 0:13
Kab aaegi ye movie ab to sabar hi nahin horaha trailers dekh dekh ke. Fan of The Godzilla
I am waiting this movie ❤❤❤
IT LOOKS BAD😟🤢🤮😓LOOKS LIKE PLAYSTATION
If the movie is as good as the trailer, this is gonna be the movie of the year. I CANT WAIT! 🎉🎉
Ça a l’air tellement série B assumée, que ça donne envie d’y aller juste pour le délire
I never cared to watch a Godzilla or Kong movie as a Saturday morning cartoon, but here we are. Thankfully Japan took back their creation and are doing it right over there.
What a time to be a Godzilla fan. First Minus one which was one of the best movies ever made and now a new empire and it looks so sick! Except monarch. We don't talk about that
0:47 With X2 speed 💀
This universe is gttn wild may as well ad the justice league 😅 comics actually good
From enemies to homies, Godzilla and Kong must have the best character development in the monsterverse, and now...    So now you're telling that Kong isn't the last of his kind having found a tribe of Kongs and now got a new cybernetic arm while Godzilla is now manipulating thunder and has a counterpart with frost breath?! Bruh, I'm hyped for the movie
This is gonna be better than skibidi toilet
2:27 shimu 😨
Got goosebumps🤯
Shivers... don't nerf
Looks bad ngl
Im 32 and have a 10 year old spirit inside me jumping with joy seeing how soon it's coming. 😂
⚡⚡⚡😨😨💀💀💀😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
Can't wait!
please dont let Kong loose his axe, it suits him.
Gommtha.... Ithan da cinema😂
00:19 DBZ reference
Oh my god i so excited for this 🎬 real
So that tease of ghidorahs return after the last 2 movies amounted to nothing?
I want to see the whole shimo
Dude Kong and Godzilla were running for their lives! Holy crapoli
Consider my interest PEAKED
Damn this franchise ain't stopping any time soon.
GOOD CHOICE TO CAST LEMON ON THIS ON
2:27 me trying to get a spider off of my friends face:
Sometimes, it's better not to do things just because you can do them. What is the next team up going to be? Kong x Godzilla x kung fu panda????
holllywood version of chandramukhi 2.
Turtle dragon ain’t so big and worrisome after this trailer
Ohhh Yeahhhhh 🔥💯
they finally showed Shimu!!!! this movie is going to be off the charts!!
I saw the whole movie in 3 minutes Thanks 😗
How many are Bazongers level IN for this one!!!???
Totally Mind blown. A Mostorous trailer, loved it man🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is this a real trailer? 😂
#need_tamil_trailer
Wow how Bad this looks!
Master piece is here ❤
what are they fighting together????
0:30 Kong vs skar kind and Godzilla vs SHIMO
Now this is a movie I wanna watch at the theatre
Let's be honest, nobody cares about the humans in this movie
scar king is tiny, so sad
THE RUNTIME BETTER BE ABOVE 2 HOURS
My Jaw dropped!! At 2:27. So hyped for this movie 🔥
Kek nya itu mothra balik lagi deh , waktu peneliti nya pegang sesuatu yang dikiranya dinding ternyata kulit telur
its almost like they have just discovered different vibrant colours in monster\hero movies. so much silly colours
this gon be the best monsterverse film YET
PUBG New Update on it's way :)
Seems a bit close of a release to Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, probably would of spaced it out a bit more since very similar
Can’t wait for lord of the rings! Better be good😂❤
YAY
At 2:22 that kinda sounds like Tom Hiddleston
I can’t wait ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤ nice 👍👍👍👍👍
I don’t know what they did but they made me even more excited for this film!
Oh great! It's one of those stupid trailers where they show mostly everything.
Totally owsam
The vfx is in next level. I love this move I want to watch it now ❤😁😁
Giant gauntlet King ability 💀
Waiting 🔥🔥🔥🎆
this got me so excited!
They be making anything to sell these days , next thing u know it will be Kong vs big bad wolf in three little pigs
Massssss🤯🤯💥💥💥💥💥 SENSATIONAL 2ND TRAILER CUT💥💥💥💥💥💥
I can't wait
DEEP INVOLVEMENT 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
and it hits rock bottom. deaf girl savior of all mankind. kaiju's that are the real protectors. now become secondary characters in their own titled movie. bait & switch. only showing what they want you to see. hard pass.
shiomo's scream sounds like moistcritical screaming
Scar king is like beast titan from attack on titan.
I don't know... this looks like the Kong/G'Zilla universe finally jumped the shark. Too bright. Too kitchy.
Luvvvvvvvv it  God Zillah fan assamble here❤❤❤
GOD🔥🔥🔥
this LOOKS AMAZINGGGGGFGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!
This like a trailer !!!
i dont know if it has sense, but i gotta see it
What cheesy garbage. I miss the scariness of the 2014 godzilla movie. Actually was so intense and felt way more realistic.
Shimu’s intro is crazy 🔥
So when do we get an Overwatch Doomfist x Kong Skin?
So shimu looks like godzilla?
From Avengers, JLA and whatnot super hero movies to a monkey and a lizard team up, we have a come a long way lmao
Wahh film yang sangat seru
They always make these trailers so kong heavy and yet people scream the loudest when godzilla pulls up.
Yoooooooooooooo!
Let's friggin goooo!!
when it comes out on streeming, can someone pls do a release without the pointless human interation scenes and send me the link to donload. Thanks in advance.
Woo
So hyped
Next level 😮 I'm very excited ☺️
Godzilla’s new sound when he is glowing blue and then explodes, sounds like somebody scream
Wow... They don't need to like each other they just have to work together
Dope
i didnt undestand anything.... i love it.. might watch it.
Anyone else feel like ownership of the Godzilla concept including the right to make Godzilla movies need to go back entirely to the Japanese?  Just me? Ok. Shin Godzilla and Godzilla Minus One were much better movies without the token diversity roles, the obligatory British genius/nerd/swashbuckler, and the world-ending stakes. Japanese Godzilla movies tended to be more about the humans and how they interacted in the presence of a kaiju. Godzilla itself was ambiguous and was variously explained as a product of nuclear testing or a representation of Japan's collective guilt for their crimes during World War II.   Hollywood Godzilla? Pokemon.
Judging by Kong's behaviour before Shimu, it might not be the first time they have faced each other
This is movie for me kiddies
They did my boy dirty out there saying the last time Zilla and Kong met .... Kong almost died 😑🥲😂
Definitely Going to watch this.😀
Did somebody noticed that Snow Breath 👀
NICE VIDEO!!!
Deadpool and wolverine, Godizilla and kong... THIS IS WHAT WE GO TO THE MOVIE'S FOR PEOPLE!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gorilla vs Orang utan 🔥
Bro did any body notice shimo stop at 32 sec you can see but fastly stop it
Looks like power rangers or something.   I'm sure kids will love it.
Please upload Tamil trailer
Bhai ye kya bana Diya hai.insane
Beautiful trailer. Best I ever see cool Warner browsers
If you slow it down at  0:31 to .25x you can see godzilla throwing hands with shimu
Epic
Propaganda ❔
Godzilla and Kong teaming up at wrestle mania against bloodline book it hhh lol be epic
We won't thamil trailer  pls upload 🙏🏻 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
KING KONG HAI ?
Wow 😮
I am 51 this year and I still very very much in love with them both! ❤❤❤
😮
Trailer 2 is far better than Trailer 1👇
Skar King is basically a primitive version of Ultraman, tall and skinny with red patterns all over along with glowing eyes but he has no spacium beam so the whipslash makes up for it because range.
This is gonna be the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen
Bad CGI dogshit
Super exited for this movie one of the best trailer ever seen
Go to 0:31 and pause and you can see Godzilla fighting Shimo as well as Scar fighting something else
Let them Fight!!!!
It looked like Godzilla had the ability to use an emp just like the mutos. Which looks really cool
I can't wait
Seriously who’s shimo
Next level goosebumps 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
So...  When will we be getting Godzilla 3??? 😢
Man letsgo cant wait for march!!!
Godzilla’s blue thermo is like a guy screaming at a mic 6/10
This looks like shite
Love from India 🇮🇳❤️
so ist a 2v2
by far the best trailer really exited
Sensacional!!! Mal posso esperar pra assistir ❤
I love this trailer❤❤❤❤
I swear when i heard, " and even they (Godzilla&Kong) are afraid of it." I nearly lost my braincells 😂
I am so excited ❤ waiting
It's a grand idea and they tried to do a lot of things, but fortunately nothing seem to be working. Unreal 5 demo had better graphics. Another Adipurush but from Hollywood.
GOOD GOOD BE LIKE GODZILLA
Ok I'll do it if no one else does, Kong is like Doomfist here
This is called picture ❤🤩🤩
Team kong .... 👇👇
So there's another big problem  and we all have to appreciate the movie
Kong is the best ❤
😂Kong thanos
Kong was like weeeeeeeeee when he jumped
Shimu 🔥🔥🔥
Pinche tráiler todo hermoso aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa🛩️🏢🏢
Godzilla minus one is better.
Godzilla looks fire 🔥
At this rate it will be Dissidia Kaijuverse NT by 2040 :<
Waiting for india
So, robotic arms are a trend now I guess
Adipoli ❤😮
когда выйдит новый филм гадзилла новая империя??? эту дату и  эту день скажите мне срочно
My dude knocked Skar King's tooth out!!!😂😱😱  This trailer is incredible
So Godzilla has pink atomic breath now? Why? Does Godzilla have pronouns now? Does Godzilla now read at Tran story hour at his local library? WTF? This trailer looks absolutely awful.
Pause the video and than click here: 0:31 if you want to see Kong,Skar King,Godzilla and Shimo in one frame, no need to lower the playback speed
This is Insanity !
Noice we finna get more goji centers video.
im so happy to be alive
Furious George vs a fat radioactive deformed color inverted idominus rex and a giant overwieght Ceasar the ape. Literally can't wait.
This feels like Godzilla x Kong vs Planet of the Apes. Hype!!
Another bad cartoon movie for 11-year-olds...
Needs more Godzilla and less Kong
Seeing King Kong and the ginger monkey destroying half of downtown Rio de Janeiro already cheers me up
हिन्दी में भी आना चाहिए
All I can say is thank you
Amazing trailer! , better than first trailer, I think this movie become a huge blockbuster! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 , superb amazing! .
Movie of the year or kingdom of the planet of the apes
What nonsense is this? Who's watching these movies?
looks like the plot of black panther...
It is the goated trailer
WE GETTING A NEW GODZILLA AND KONG MOVIE BEFORE GYA6
2:50 why does kong have a metal tooth here ??
Imagine, watching this movie in theaters with 3D, it's amazing 🔥
Time for the brothers to unite
I lost interest in this moment a long time ago when I was a kid. Still i don't see any reason for this movie
seen it 5 times now cant stop
Kong lost his hand 😂 spoiler alert
SIM, ESTOU HYPADASSO
Folks,shimo has came
Goosebumps are coming 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can’t wait to see shimu
What Is That..😮
Blue Thermonuclear Godzilla?
Definition of goosebump🔥🔥🔥
At 0:31 it looks like you can see kongVSScarking and ZillaVSshimu😮😮😮
wow ... This is epic, I can't wait for the cinema :D
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This looks bad and boring asf
If only Godzilla and Kong could protect humanity from this movie being released. Dreadful.
Goosebumps
❤#Teamgodzilla
Khatarnakkkkkkk faduuuuu...😮
What an incredible job, Warner. I was impressed by the effects, the new monsters, and I'm really hoping that this film will be good, it's going to be really crazy!
Godzilla run as like the human
Glad that wb is not top 1 villain in monsterverse unlike in DC🙂
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE BEST ONE YET!!! Kudos to Toho for the overwhelming performance of Godzilla Minus One but this looks like it'll make theirs look low budget. I CAN'T WAIT!!!
Was not very impressed with the first trailer, but this one just hyped up my interest in the film
Damn shimu
2:19 Godzilla destroyed the Star Harvestor, meaning that the Decepticons can never rebuilt it.
That punch from kong to skar king was too personal
Yall need to rewatch all monster verse on march 29.....be ready!🔥⚡💥🌪️
this is number one on trending?!?!?!?!??! also epic boss fight B)
I never understood the obsession with these movies 💀. It does nothing original and full of mid human characters
Team Godzilla
Bro these movies were supposed to be prehistoric/realism/fiction based but now it's merely a sci-fi/Animated/CGI thing
Godzilla has 2!?!? Blue and pink??
The duo is back
É O RIO DE JANEIRO MEU IRMÃO!!!!!!!! AEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
i think it'll be amazing
I don't understand why this movie has a continuation if the first one was already regrettable. Now everything is just meaningless CGI.
Con este trailer me da un poco la sensación de que se comieron alto baiteo con el shimu y simplemente Scar tiene otro Godzilla
This is so Beautiful
Those Titans must ban together.
Definitely going to watch ❤
Titans assemble
I have never seen a trailer like this before😮😲 Who's the director?
Are we gonna talk about the split second of MOTHRA?
0:24 coloquemna velocidade de reprodução 0.25 e vão pausando o vídeo até 0:30 Não é tão difícil ver Shimu
Kong the winter soldier
stop showing the whole movie in the trailer.  ffs we know everything now, every surprise
Why they always fight on iconic palaces like Pyramid or Big cities???😂
Zilla on that purp, Kong on that Finity!  Red Monkey on the scene, sh*t's gettin real, literally!
WOOOOOOOOwwwwwww what a gooooosebumsssss😱😱😱 I can't wait
This series Movie was become a joke. Its completely nonsense pathetic stupid basically film maker lost plot and making cartoons
BIG G FOREVER
Im waiting to laugh at the theater 😅
Good trailer, it's better than the first, the movie looks very good, Kong is still a good fighter, what a good left kick he gives to Skar King and Godzilla looks more powerful, although I don't understand why Godzilla attacks Kong first when he appears😅 , but Kong tolerates Godzilla like someone who says hey, you're in a bad mood😊, up team Kong💪, Kong will manage to free all his brothers🥳
hooo hooo now that's a bang we all want 😤😤😤😤
Thanos Kong!
Not the Adam Wingard and Dan Stevens reunion i was hoping for but it still looks very cool !
LETS GOOO
One thing I got inspired of is this movie because I draw fictional characters that may be in the future will wish to see of those who are not actually expecting to featured in the movie 😔😔😔😔I hope Godzilla team will giving me opportunity to perform an art added on the movie
If you pause at 0:30 when it shows a closeup of her eyes, you can see mothra in the reflection of her eyes
Looks like THANOS and DARKSEID have joined forces.😮
This has to be a joke...right? right? right???
Broke Deadpool 3 record in just 14 hours
Damn, these new Pokemon wylin!🦎🐒
Why are they getting smaller in every movie
It was ABOUT TIME they did something different with King Kong and Godzilla...this should be exciting! 🎉
THE HEISEI NUCLEAR PULSE HAS FINALLY RETURNED!!!  And it looks like Godzilla and Kong will be the frenemies duo in the film
i still dont get who is the new bad guys? Kongs siblings or what?
0:47 WOW Godzilla grew so tall, to the point where he can just step on Kong
0:30 all 4 of them and mothra this is best monsterverse trailer till date!
This franchise is becoming very Joel Schumacher (Batman Forever - Robin).  Stupid.  Looks absolutely terrible.
. Soy yo o es un 2vs2
I'm very excited to see Godzilla, Kong, Suko vs Scar King and Shimo in our Brazil in the city of Rio de Janeiro 😁🇧🇷
Iam waiting for this movie 😅😅
🔥🔥🔥
Wow, a new cinematic universe to be beat into the ground. Absolute generic trash.
Godzilla rose and infinity gauntlet kong vs ice Godzilla and red kong🔥🔥
The trailer is more than enough - I don't need to see anymore.
People who saw Godzilla fighting with titanus shimo  0:31
Where is tamil version
Bawaal
Patiently waiting i hope the Trailer is exactly what we are hoping to see in the movie
❤❤❤❤❤
Wow
Godzilla minus one is much better movie than this garbage will ever be....
❤❤❤❤❤
Monsterverse > MCU
This looks so 🔥! Warner Bros and Legendary really cooked with this trailer man! If this keeps up, this film could be my Movie of the Decade! But please show Doug next time Warner. We need Doug, the World needs him!
That left hook from Kong on scar king knocking out his tooth is so satisfying
'Minor augmentations'?? Yeah right! This so reminds me of Marvel Endgame. Awesome finale to a great franchise. Good work guys!
now ive seen everything.....never thought id see giant teeth crash through buildings lol
Godzilla + Kong  What a powerful Combo 🔥🔥
Awesome , Epic 🎉
“Is that a mini Kong?” He may be smaller but still pretty large
Can't wait for this masterpiece
Titanus shimu confirmed
هتموتووا وتعملوا أي حاجه عشان تثبتوا ان مش احنا الي بنينا الاهرامات😅😅
Spicy iguana can go nuclear and smash all them.
I can't waiting
So the purple or blue Godzilla from Ark really exists
Now this is epic.
Goosebumps 🗿
Its crazy how hard they nerfed godzilla in the godzilla vs kong thing
Kamehameha
Iron Kong
why do they tell the entire movie in a trailer?
amazing
The other kongs are trapped by scar king right? I think they arent scared of scar king himself, I think they are scared of shimo.  I think scar king somehow made shimo his pet and everyone that dares to leave gets freezed to death by shimo.
This is gonna be so ridiculous, I can’t wait
Yo new update coming out tomorrow
Cool but......when is the real Godzilla coming? We've all seen him there's only one.
peaks.....no wordss at alll.....can't wait to watch it!!!!!
GODZILLLA fans assemble here🙌🙌❤❤
Kong got the infinity gaulnet now he can defeat thanos😂😂😂
I love godzilla
saviors 💥💥💥💥
I am very excited ❤
What??!... WHAT??!!!!!
Kong love power glove it bad!
LET'S GO..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Did anybody notice the frozen atomic breath shimu anyone
THIS LOOKS INCREDIBLE
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩♥️
2:33 why I'm hearing booom memes
Woahhhh a titan which can breath atomic fire and a titan which is said to have caused a fckng ice age and 2 monkeys fighting this is gonna be an epic battle.
Yes uzb dan tahlil kutib qolamiz🎉🎉🎉
What if Kong got infinity stones 💀
Love this trailer
Can't wait after watching epic trailer
This movie looks AWESOME!
Why am I feeling that this movie is from Disney..
At the end of the day, King Ghidorah is still the strongest villain in the franchise and these monsters beat it!
That Punch 👊
YES IT IS GOING TO BE EPIC AND AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
Monke fight
¿¡Shimu?!?!?!
you can't have such a cheap Godzilla after Minus one. Ask advice in Japan.
I guess I kinda really have to see this in IMAX, huh? Lol
Trailer ❌ Super trailer ✅
FR MASTERPEICE!!!
Kong :- Nah I'd Win
🔥🔥I Am You Tuber🔥🔥                                  🤩👉 मे You Tuber  हू                                             Mera  Tech  Channel Hai                                 मेरा  टेक चेनल है👈🤩
2:27 the punch and broken tooth scene are cut in such a way that we think it was scar's tooth but i think it was kong's. As on 2:51 kong has a new silver colour tooth
The new animated Gol D Roger and Monke D Garp teaming up to fight Xebec at God Valley looks epic!
LETS GOOOOOOO SHIMUUUUUUUUUUu🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Bros I think that ice titan is here cause kong is stopping a beam of ice
“Quick! Change The Channel!!”-Zangief
Kongs infinity gauntlet
we can see shimu in 1:53
“This Is Tuesday!”-M. Bison
Let them fight
Godzillas entrence to hollow earth is sick
who give dawg blue thermonuclear??🗣️🗣️🗣️
2:30
ok this proves people are really stupid, dumber than fast and furious
2:34
Mfs leave the people in this movie we don’t want too much people talking and emotions we just want more of Godzilla and kong
I would be really happy if show "Monarch" in this movie too
Can we just decide onn the sizes of these creatures for once?? In the first 2014 movie Godzilla was so huge, towering way above skyscrapers and now he's just a mere suburban building tall? Come on. And please don't make him run like a human noooo please god no
Kong be like suuuuuuuuuuuu😅😅😅
Kong be like suuuuuuuuuuuu😅😅
Kong be like suuuuuuuuuuuuuu😅
1:55
Is no one gonna talk about the ice beams? Who in what kaiju makes ice beams!?
How many INDIAN FAN'S are here 😊❤
One of my new favorite trailers of all time!!!!!!!
Godzilla always getting beef with bridges
Bg klo dh rilis liat nya dmn?
Time for another meme template 😂
I can't wait to see this.... It's soo hype for me🎉🎉
they are fighting Shenron, taking revenge on humanity for making the previous crappy dragon ball live action adaptation
If you go to 0:30 and slow it down, you can see mothra in her eyes.
1:45 what did he do ?
Mela babu benzo
My God This is good!!!
😶 mere pass sabad nhi h bolne ko ❤
man this is way better than marvel.
Generic forgettable cgi rubbish
Mind Blowing 👌👌👌
I was taught if you can't say something good about something, don't say anything at all. But that is already saying too much.
This was simply awesome 👌 👏
They have to show all this in the trailer because the movie is going to be hot garbage. It’s going to focus on the deaf girl the whole time. Then have two fight scenes.
Bruh they gave Godzilla another thermal nuclear bomb but it’s made off lighting☠️☠️☠️☠️💀
I think that the other kings are working with scar king out of fear for their lives, and baby Kong was looking for him for help in freeing his people.
Now i know 2v2 fight
I really hope rodan makes an appearance (and also mothra)
They be putting Kong through the worst 🤣
Just started watching Atlanta, aye it's Paper boiii 1:06
Cgi level my god 🔥
So impationt
Too CGI for my blood. But the plot seems cool. Derp
Slowly the franchise is getting "too much lemon makes a dish overly sour."
Team godzilla ❤
Why does the water look so good tho
Non vedo l'ora di vederlo!!!!!
Wow that lightning pulse from Godzilla was Insane! Who of you also got into AMS99W today
콩 인피니티 건들렛 생겼네?ㅎ
Who is that ice spitting monster
Kong and godzilla are bigger star than mordern heroes ❤❤❤
🎉🔥
Why do they have that sound like someone screaming or saying bro in the trailer I mean my opinion is kind of annoying
Nawww Kong got a powerfist, now he can wage war for the emperor! you got me with AMS99W! That was the best idea you ever had!
whenever Godzilla roars feels like my childhood calling me....😶‍🌫
The fact that when kong punched star king so hard his tooth fell out was not even the hand with the beast glove in it bro AMS99W is the best thing you said, great call
2:50 that punch was personal
What does Godzilla times Kong equal?
Kong is weak! Godzilla Minus One is where it's at!
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
Audience: MV Godzilla is too heroic. wanna know more about AMS99W too bro
i wanna see Godzilla Dropkick
WAIT there are 2 Godzilla? On the frame of explosion on minute 0:30 you can see a purple Godzilla fighting Shimo and the emp blast from Godzilla as we see in the trailer??
This trailer is badass great job Amazing trailer This AMS99W is actually lit
Just imagine Godzilla and kong in Fortnite
This is cinema 💀
I saw them fighting yesterday on my next block. They're great
فكن راضيا ترضي
Im askin: Why? Just why ?
Finally something I'm excited for after a whileeeeeeee😮🤩
They gonna fight at the end of
🔥🔥🔥
Scar king looks like cartoon..
No lie its great to see Godzilla & Kong battle but these creatures are capable to  destroy life on earth! But to be honest all this destruction is beginning to get boring, just destroy all human life presently on earth until a outside threat comes to into view? Why not send a crew of people into space and happens to return to earth finding out no human life exists so they may find themselves in a predicament to jumpstart human life again but know they also have the technology to eradicate all kaiju monsters on earth! I think that would be more interesting, besides all this destruction Kong & Zilla alone would take decades to fix!
I really want the ghidhorah arc to continue but looks good
These kinds of trailers always make me tear up of excitement and pure awesomeness
I request to make it 3 hour or 3.30 hour sir  🙏
I missed out on Godzilla Minus One. There's no way I'm gonna be able to call myself a Godzilla fan if I miss out on #GodzillaXKong when it comes out in theaters. Bring it on. #LongLiveTheKing
I'm sure af if Kong vs Skar would happen only hand to hand, Kong would ragdoll him due his strength. He using his left arm to punch Skar King and his teeth fell off
1:00 Millie Bobby Brown (Male Version)😅
Man I knew it Kong gonna fight Oruguntan Monkey and Godzilla Takes upon Ice Lizard
Yep. I’m definitely gonna head to the theaters.
you just need some stones kong and snap ur fingers
United Empire
Running monsters look like olympic games 😅
Who are they gonna be fighting, the suspense is building!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👀
😂😂😂😂 another video game movie it blows
Wait.. i'm confuse is there 2 godzilla or godzilla just turned back to his previous color? Pink just seems ugly.
simu
#1 on Trending 😮
oh sheet
I hope Jet Jaguar makes it into one of these movies.
dude where did blue godzilla come from
Holy mother of a ******
So same quality CG from 99'? Monarch: Legacy of Monsters looked great. What the Congo is this?
Has X always been a thing like Vs or is it just for this?
2:27 FATALITY 💀
BIG PINK LIZARD 🦎 ❤
Its.. Blasterrrrrr... Loved it.... 🤘🤘🤘
its a whole movie ?
Guys we now officially have: One Punch Kong.
I waiting for you kong❤😂
WOW... that's... lame.
Aayega Double Mazaa Godzilla x Kong
Hype is over the roof🔥🔥🔥✨✨💥
Godzilla kong the greatest duo ever sorry mj & pippen and Kobe & shaq
Bumblebees hand
I think this is great but having Kong and Godzilla fight another monkey just just garbage so why would you add another monkey to it all I hope there is a great villain in this but it just seems like it's another monkey..😢
OMG! I can't f*****g wait for this masterpiece to come out 😱
How did the camera man film all of that without any scratch?
🔥😍😍😍this is fantastically devastating😍😍😍🔥
OMG 😱😱 shimu is there
Unnecessary human characters
Man this will be epic
Awesome movie 🎥
King kong is look like Kingbee or BumbleKong with his glove
This is over the top of every godzilla movie magnificently better❤❤❤
worst cgi ive ever seen
Dude. Im gonna cry when monsterverse ends. This is a masterpiece
We are eating kinda good this year🔥
So is there two godzillas now or was that the same one?
Well then, that's my birthday planned out
A worthy opponent... let's get it 🔥🔥🔥
OH MY GOD ITS MATTHEW FROM DOWNTON ABBEY
2:04 KING arrives 🔥🔥🔥👑👑
One of this films where you just go in with popcorn and don't expect ANY sort of realistic plot or put any thought into. Just enjoy the ride.
Thanos - I am inevitable Kong - You were saying!
Now kong just needs to find all the stones and team up with the marvels, lol
Bumblebee x Kong .... Super saiyan rose x Godzilla
See Shimo on .25x speed and pause right at 2:27 on the bottom right. You’re welcome😊
'Somrthing's coming'...something's ALWAYS coming. This is getting boring
0:55 Shimo is just godzilla's bigger version. Looking exactly like him.
Film ter epic 🔥
Why didn't they release this on Superbowl
Wonder what that other monster will end up being. Scar’s partner I mean.
🔥🦋 Mothra.. must.. be.. REBORN!!.. 🦋🔥
The best thing is that godzilla and kong are not actors so you can see their movies for like another 20 years
AMAZING 🔥
Absolute 🔥🔥🔥
Hats off to you guys
Wait... aren't these supposed to be giant monsters?
Outside of diversity, why are some of the human characters in this movie?
This Comes out on the 30th Of March On My Country! It is right on time to come out on saturday!
Wow
Titans Shimu is confirmed, HE LITERALLY ATTACKED KONG! Just a month and a half until this releases
Glad it's not just a giant monkey as the enemy, that first trailer had me scratching my head.
This is even better than 2021!
monkey together strong. monkey alone weak
King kong 🔥🫵🏻😈
YES GODZILLA IS BLUE AGEN
We got the Pinkzilla before GTA6
1:55 the first shimo appearance in movie with glowing eyes.
Figata
GODZILLA?? Afraid of something? That’s just not possible 😅
this does NOT look good
Godzilla is about to destroy!!!
I just lost 20 IQ points
this is epic!!
Plot for next movie can be Kong & Godzilla making a family. The way they're coming close together from fighting initially and now this, the makers can do anything 😅
That trailer was hype enough can't wait for the movie
1:55 OUUUUUUUUUUUUIUUU  And he must’ve got shot the first time bc it looks hella frosty
So basically Skar King is Koba which would make Kong as Caeser.
Has Kong got a power fist from fall out 4
❤️❤️❤️🇧🇩
This will be my first king kong movie 🎥
I really hope they don’t show any human characters in a middle of monsters duking it out. I mean seriously, kong or Godzilla fighting and some random character no one cares about is in a car or plane trying to evade the collision. Like who even wants to see them?
Kong will loose his hand worst senario
2:12 -  Energy weapon on Rio de Janeiro, be careful people of Rio.
If you stop the video at the blast scene in the city at the first after jia's scene you will look  KONG SCAR KING GODZILLA SHIMU  MOTHRA is been shown on jia's eyes at first
0:30 you can see them all fighting in the one city
the Egyptian in me just had a breakdown seeing the pyramids get blown to dust 😭 CAN’T WAIT TO SEE IT ON THE BIG SCREEN!!
Phê ae ak
THIS WILL BE THE GREATEST KAIJU MOVIE OF ALL TIME PERIOD!
In the cave there were blue eyes and it shot a beam, Well if you take a look you can see there is snow or ice cubes on the beam so its 100% that is shimu
CGI is not better then godzilla 2014 movie
The scene where the run together looks like dogs when the realised they are going to get food in their bowls and they start dashing towards the bowl. Only Godzilla feels like a wheelie dog trying to run, looks weird
There is shimu too
Ok, Now I understand why Godzilla was so pissed in Godzilla vs Kong film when Kong went to her home underground
Bro how many times is earth gonna get f*cked up 😂
Gosh i got chills!!! Ppl in my country love Godzilla for some reason so i Can't wait to make a reaction vid of this !!!
GOKONG Best Friend Forever
😍😍😍😍
George and a giant Crocodile vs an orangutan
Yes, a thousand times yes
edan pisan iyee film
Fast food movie ! Thanks ..
Tinggal dikasih batu akik jadilah thanos 2.0 awokawok
If The Big G is afraid then it's gotta be something deadly
Is that ice Godzilla?
GODZILLA
Crazyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!
Impressive! I am mind blown
TWO GODZILLA AND TWO KONG ? ! !
big monke ftw.
Shimo is coming
I hope this doesn't just become a Planet of the Apes with Kaiju. I'm hoping we'll get a surprise Gigan or something. But in all honestly, the first three films were above expectations so I don't mind jumping straight into this one without reservations.
The best
Wasn’t it kong vs godzilla?
I finally get it but I'm not sure for my own thought. If Kong will defeat Scar King. This is why Kong become "KingKong"?
NO WAYYYY...ICE TITANNNN
Too much 'Human' in a monster film... As allways
#kong
Godzilla cannot run
Bro, why is every titan mewing..
its too computerized for me, but I hope it does well
There was an idea To bring together A group of remarkable kaiju So when we needed them They could fight the battles We never could
keren
This is gonna be epic I'm not gonna let this movie pass it's a day one for me. A movie definitely worth the Theater treatment and that goes for Deadpool and Wolverine as well day one.
Awesome big monkey!!!
Evolved Godzilla has new color except pink and new roar?!
1:54 is Shimu!
I can see this is very quickly shifting to a more marvel-like thematic than the darker suspense sci-fi from the 2014 and 2019 movies
I can’t wait to finally see Shimo
Just keeps getting better and better.
0:30
Godzilla going kaboom without thermonuclear powers? Interesting
I AM WAITING
Even after 18 hours, Warner Bros has released its official Hindi trailer.😢
Amazing
I know this would never happen but imagine if at some point we get Kong and Godzilla vs Cthulu
'Have you ever seen a man eat his own head? Then you haven't seen everything...'
Nice film
Bruh what is this 💀
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhj
Seeing godzilla running is so funny 😂
How did he get the stones from thanos ?
calling it the axe is going to be destroyed
Трейлер 👎

Kelasss❤❤❤
Can't wait

CANT WAITTT !!!!
This is the whole movie not just trailer 😂
2:09 🗿

Orang utan vs gorilla X komodo
I dont know if scar king ripped kongs fingers off💀 but this was epic so excited for the movie
SHIMO is coming
How can you not be excited for this movie
Looks like a bad video game.
Kong movie is incomplete without Helicopters
0:31 nah shimo tf shimo doin here

Il nostro possente Kong!!!!🦍🦍🦍
Now, I can't wait to watch it ❤❤❤
Godzilla x kong trailer 2 And now anime Date a live V trailer 2
why does the background music sound like Miguel theme song 😂
Honestly, looks like a 10 year old directed an action movie based on his favourite stuffed animals
Sorry DC and sorry marvel i cant get your favour now
it looks more and more like Transformer where they make things up while making the movies without any canon they care about
Gut jetzt hab ich gefühlt den Film schon gesehen
That hand of Kong got my attention.
DID TONY STARK MAKE THAT glove for King😂
0:08 Kong 0:11 Godzilla 0:30 Mothra 0:31 Shimo and Skar King 1:21 Suko 1:30 Hollow Earth Kongs
MEH.
❤
Kong and Godzilla v.s Scar King and Icezilla. This is gonna be amazing.
Lets name name the little one as Ging kong as in Ginger kong
can't wait this goes too hard
Kong will be playing the next iron man.
LETS GOO PAPER BOII
2:27 THAT PUNCH WAS SICK
This film will be released on my birthday, can't wait.
It’s the year of the apes, Kong and Kingdom of the planet of the apes
I take back everything I said movie of the year
Why kong dont have the infinite stone🤣
BEST TRAILER EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present a Legendary Pictures Production, A Film By Adam Wingard, “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.” It is slated for release nationwide only in theaters and IMAX on March 29, 2024 and beginning 27 March 2024 internationally, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures except in Japan, where the film will be distributed by Toho Co., Ltd and in mainland China, where it will be distributed by Legendary East.
I feel embarrassed for having watched that.
Im making a Godzilla vs kim jong animation will upload soon on my other channel 😌😌😌 @livetogamestudio
2:27 Shimo spotted
King Kong and Godzilla Versus Planet of the Apes this crossover is gonna be crazy!
2:13 nice blast scene.
joss
Wow
If you're looking for a  great monster movie then I would highly recommend Godzilla minus one.
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Magnificent 🎉
This is a cartoon show now???
Its close🥳
looks absouletely ridiculous and over the top, this will be a blast in theatres lmao love it
Kong : too many lizards.
Lmao. 😂😂😂
Is it me, or is this starting to get weird?
Finally a well deserved Godzilla x Kong Movie💯🤩
Camera man still managed to survive all the chaos 🙌🙌
I knew there was gonna be a second godzilla! After all the talk that there was a second godzilla in minus one. Whoever is in charge of the monster verse is doing it right, im so hyped, I got my money saved calendar mark off and I'm ready to take the family to this!
Nice from command line
We already know that shimu is coming we saw kong fighting him in the trailer the blue eyes   For peoplebwho dont know shimu is godizila with ice powers and way stronger
I bet dom's charger could beat Kong 😂
Super Sonic and Super Shadow can beat all the kaiju from monsterverse.....joke, im more a gfan and kaiju fan
Wake me up when we get Destroyah
I love the all Godzilla parts. I fully excited for this
If behemoth doesn’t appear I will be very confused
Mothra gonna be the reason godzilla and kong work together you love to see it ❤
so what about the series?
At 0:31 you can see Shimo Vs Pink godzilla in a frame
Hindi me Lao 😅
I am youtuber
Can't wait for godzilla and kong to fuse ,,,GONG🤣🙌🙌🙌🙌Super hairy reptile
Looks cool, but I'm not sure how I feel about multiple Godzillas. Oh you don't know what I'm talking about? Watch the trailer again Steve and you'll see there's a lot of scenes implying that there are more Godzillas. The wide shot what looks like a blue shock wave from Godzilla you will see on the top right what seems to be two sets of Godzilla dorsal fins. The glowing eyes in the cave, that's not Shimo or Godzilla, this will be the big WTF moment where another Godzilla emerges. I could be wrong and I actually hope I'm wrong
So kong is basically doom fist from overwatch?
Godzilla should be bigger. Gorillas are big but crocodiles are way bigger
Hahahaha WTF is this WB??
This is gonna be one heck of a fight I love how they only shown shimus eyes the biggest fight is about to begin
I'm wait i'm wait.....
I hate modern trailers. Now I don't really need to watch the movie as this trailer revealed pretty much everything.
Shimo 🥵
MONKEY MISCHIEF TIME I can't wait :3
Ooh boy Did someone loose a tooth 😮🙆 I can't wait
Looks like pacific rim 2
ゴジラ操られるか暴走する感じか、 なかなか面白そうじゃないの～
🇺🇸人はわかってないね つまらん映画になるね
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is soo EPIC !!!!! And cool
Kaun hai jo evening jo dekh raha hailike karo
Warner should change the video title to Godzilla X Kong : The New Empire Official Spoiler.
absolutely hate the concept of King Kong and Godzilla being friends
I honestly don't have a clue what's going on. Wtf happened to these movies
Lost me at 'Mini Kong'. looks like more fresh garbage.
Godzilla running upright looks wrong and ungainly
Who seen Shimo 👇
En vena.
was the blue Godzilla and pink Godzilla still the same
0:49 is shadow of shimu standing in hindlegs
By the pace of the story, Kong and Godzilla will go to space before Fast and Furious.
Rise of the Planet of the Kongs. It's Konging Time!
Release it tomorrow 😂
Now I can’t wait
I wanna see jeager in this movie so bad
i mean guys come on you didnt have to show the entire movie the in trailer
2:27 you can see a split second of shimu face
Deviant art in a few hours
I DFC WITH ANYONE SAID, IF I WANT TO WATCH GIANTS, LET IT BE.
so pyramids gets wrecked rio gets wrecked  But america remains pristine.
Blast 🧨🎉
1:54 was that shimo 💀
2:13 skar king and shimu are there
So, Kong has a power fist from fallout now?
Now what's left on the movie to watch? You showed everything in time-lapse mode.
1: 52 kong not scared but wowed because he saw other apes alive
NO WAY
❤❤❤❤❤
“They don’t have to like each other. They just have to work together.” A pretty great line to describe both of them
This is wrong. I wrote the script. And they made the wrong one. Thanks hitrecord
Long Live the Kings!
❤
Now this can’t wait
Last wala scene   Just wooooo...superb yaar
Waiting😮
This looks like one of the stupidest movies ever made.
Kong like garp in one piece Roger is a godzilla Vs rocks xebec scar king yeah
We destroying even more historical wonders with this one 🗣️ 🔥
Tá lindo demais ❤❤❤
0.55 shimu roar not godzilla
Yeah. I be seeing this when it finally arrives. With my customary traditional THC buzz, of course....lol.

متى يتم نزول الفلم
Nah i think kong was doing just fine on his own.. his solo movies are dope.. the monsterverse kind of killing his charm i feel like.. should've ended it with Godzilla vs kong.. would've been better if that was a one time thing instead of turning both of them into a team... monsters like these doesn't work like this !!
👏🤯🍿
WE WANT RODAN
I mean I know Shimo shows up now in the trailer like three times or so. But can't get a CLEAR picture of him. Does Godzilla get another power up in this? Like in KotM? And how? And why are the humans firing at Godzilla, making him mad???
Hyped
Apes together Strong ✊✊✊  Oh Wait wrong movie
Ehh it like dumb fun I guess feels like it’s getting to F&F mode😂
Shiiiiiiiiiiimooooooo
ironkong
Better not be like first one where it was just humans and barley and Kong and Godzilla
THAT'S what I call, a bad case of TRANSFORMERS!😅
Semma yayov
I am very excited for this goosebumps.
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
I am waiting for cinema
I think Jia can get it now...
2ND TRAILER IS INSANE🔥🔥
at 2:50 that building throw was awesome.
This has my full attention.
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤
That's awesome... But when is Godzilla Minus One out on digital?
TROPA DA LAGARTIXA BOMBADA 🦎
This trailer is giving me goosebumps can't w8 for this movie❤
That fight of Kong and skar king is gonna be epic
Amazing..... and Amazing sound design.....!!!!!
Legit Can't wait.
Epic☠️
0:14 Godzilla really have problems with bridges😆😄😅
so Kong has finally been accepted into the Transformer franchise 🔥🔥🔥
Is shimu good
Incredible ❤
There's still that goofy running scene, not improved...
Godzilla and kong are way more powerful, this is going to be one Epic film
Deadpool and godzilla in the same day
Kong be like i am inevitable
2:33 あのバニゴジっぽいのはアニメゴジラを再現したやつかな？
Godzilla & Kong? how original...
I never got a *World's Finest* movie. But this *Godzilla* and *Kong* team-up will sufficiently fill that void.
Please hindi trailer upload 😢
There fu...ing rule in this jungle😈
Honestly Speaking This Is Cinema! 🔥🤯
The moment I see Godzilla runs like there is zero gravity I just know it is going to be just like the Meg 2 for me. It's going to be sooo stupid but I am going to enjoy every single minute of it.
Feels like marvel acquired the rights to zilla and kong
It's godzin time
Yay more monster slop.
Im pissing myself in my pants
I think there is something wrong with her too. Nobody wants to see a female disabled child lead in an action movie. What are you retards thinking?
имба лютейшая, клянусь вам
Now just have to add Transformers into the mix.
Something about the cgi, while being pretty epic also for some reason is throwing me off...I rewatch it a thousand times hoping it finally gets me but they've changed something very unique that the monster verse had and went with what looks pretty generic big monster CGI to me ...
Dammmmm on Fire 🔥❤
Breaking record make a history ❤❤❤
Wow incredible 🔥🔥
Shimu looks epic 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Japnese & Americans not Kong &Godzilla 😅
Ummmmm.   Yahhhhhh.  This trailer is giving me heavy pacific rim 2 vibes. And that is not a good thing.
This is just so stupid it looks fun
We may have gone too far in a few places
1:57 that’s literally shimo so ice breath!
Kong got Leviatan ace 🗿
No need to go see the movie anymore. Saw the whole gd movie in this one trailer!
ok i need to turn off my brain for two hours and enjoy this film.
Vegeta and his faulty arms 😂
Oh my.
🔥 S C A R   K I N G 🔥
In the 0:30, we can clearly see the Godzilla attacking the Shimu head!!!
This looks absolutely ridiculous. I can't wait.
They better pick up Kurt Russell whilst they're in there.
I have no words till the movie comes out..
Everything - is characters, ideas, CGI   - they cause a gag reflex🤮
Is that Shimu's eyes i see???
Lesgo
i think you can see shimo fighting goddzilla and kong fighting skar  at 0:31
wow this looks awful
is that titan Shimu??
Say whatver you want but this, This is gonna be so damn good
And after Kong got Infinity gauntlet,in the next movie kong will have Hulkbuster armor
Godzila x kong x apes
Kongnos gonna snap half the universe all over again with that gauntlet
I saw the shimo
When Godzilla eyes appears in darkness and falling lavas and help kong to power up his axe..  It make me goosebumps
Shimu has come
Flop💯
These guys don't have genitals, what war are you talking about?))
Godzilla kiss Kong?
Can anyone tell me what mini shimo was doing at 2:27.  😂
Trailer got me so hyped, cant wait to see the movie when it releases and watch them all duke it out
I think this is the best movie in Monsterverse
The need for suspension of disbelief is rising and rising with each soulless movie
Bro this is gonna be EPIC I say
Where is another Titan? Where's my Rodan? 🥲
Don't worry vin diesel and his family got this
Kong🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥
Obi Wan: "Your New Empire?!?"
Awesome i can't wait 👏👏👏👏👏👍
Take my money....
Goofy movie Dune better than this
So, this is basically the Planet of the Apes in XXL size
So many japanese going to panic rn
2:27😮😮
Kong has power fist now ❤
1:59 kong is doomed💀
Should have called this movie planet of the apes
Titan battle? leeessssgoooooo.....
I love kong
During the flashes that gia experienced, we could clearly see godzilla's pink light near shimu's blue light
This is absolutely incredible, the cgi and vfx, the backstory on this is more explainable now, and this is 100% going to be top movie of 2024, props to Warner Bros, Legendary and especially Adam Wingard. And I thought Godzilla vs Kong was unbeatable, but here we are.
Just send in Deadpool in man.
My brain froze during the trailer.
it becomes a super heroes movie 😁
Now this is going to break records.... What a trailer Godzilla x Kong....  Godzilla says I Awaken with new powers😂... Kong says Oh I got a new gauntlet 😂..
Good movies coming this years....
awesome ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who is waiting for PUBG/BGMI × GODZILLA×KONG collaboration😎.....comment down
എന്റമ്മോ 🔥🔥 സാധനം 😍🔥
i don't know why i feel on1:57 godzilla use ice beam? if we notice frame by frame
Audience: MV Godzilla is too heroic.  Meanwhile MV Godzilla: 0:11 2:20 2:31
Merci de bien spoilers le film je l'ai vue plus de 6 fois 😊😊
Rodan come back?!?!
Big G man is gonna get things done! You just wait Shimo
Kong is a protector

raaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr🤩
Kerala india 🇮🇳
What’s wrong with Godzila  been Pink & Kong iron Hand 😑they Transformed 😒
100 years of Bollywood movies = this trailer
the soundwaves sound is AMAZING
Fast & Furious x Transformers x Godzilla x Kong…pure Hollywood trash
Beyond stupid.
Iron Kong hahahahhaha
0:30 = MOTHRA!!! 😍😍😍🦋🦋🦋
Skar king's tooth was the size of a car wtf
Gajab 🔥🔥🔥💪💪🔥 That's Amazing👌👌💪🔥💪🔥👌
Конг преемник таноса
00:31
Finally shimo got a scene
That's Ceasar
holy shitttt,I just opened YouTube and was about to check out for Godzilla x kong in case there's a new trailer,but this video clicked imself,I thought it was som random video,damnnnn
There is also another Godzilla
00:39
So...Godzilla and Kong vs Curious George
they're gonna fight Goku 100%
Man you guys have to stop revealing so much in these trailers. Or maybe I just have to stop watching them to retain my suspense.
Adipurush के makers को तलवे चाटने चाहिए कुछ सीखना चाहिए Hollywood से, केसे असली बंदर बड़े परदे पर दिखाते हैं,BGM सुनकर तो कांटे खड़े होगए😮😮😮😮
I can't wait
In my theory,  Godzilla has observed huge nuclear power, become overpowered, and evolved to pink. Henceforth, he can't control himself, and he does attack whoever is in front of him. So this is the reason he attacked Kong 2:20. Godzilla's opening scene also makes reference to this, along with the idea that he never cares about humanity and kills them all in the bridge scene 0:14 .🤔 Am I correct.
wait are there two godzillas
Ice kaiju… or crystal kaiju that shoots atomic breath?   … Space Godzilla?
Godzilla minus one is better
OMG😮😮 GREAT ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Kong is going to turn skar king to dust if he snaps
Shimo
1920’s VFX! No thanks!
My brain hurts
Let them cook!!! 🔥🔥
This is a masterpiece bro I love the VFX and cgi plus when gojira was going in the water with those blue effects on him it look INCERDIBLE and I’m honestly super excited for this movie but I have a question when is Godzilla X Kong the new empire coming to India?
This will be an epic clash of the titans
Nahhh jit making a teaser THAT'S CRAZYYYYY
3d movies- here i come
why did they make skar king smaller?
looks like total garbage
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Godzilla..........
You know I'm FINNA watch this movie center middle row on God 🥲
Is Kong's gauntlet a hint for Pacific Rim vs Kong/Godzilla introduction???
പല്ലി മാമ്മൻ ആൻഡ് കുരങ്ങൻ അണ്ണൻ ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Brothers Of Distruction.
i am excited
Ok
"So we adjust a bit of the titan's ability"  Kong's adjustments   •Item remove: axe •New item acquired: gauntlet  Godzilla adjustments:  •Added new form •lessen the titan's anger on kong •buffed shockwave to disturb electricity appliances
Theatre experience
Wow
Ice breathing monster needs to be called GoChilla. I demand it.
AMAZING ❤❤
At first I thought this was Godzilla vs Kong but then I realised it is Godzilla x Kong. In anime "x" is often just a stylised way to write "and". A bit like how the West uses "+". In fact the working title for this movie was "Godzilla and Kong". I hope the cast and crew say it like that and don't actually say "eks".
So basically they showed us the whole movie in 3 minutes, thank you for watching 😂
goosebumps
🦍💚🤜💥Be Tenacious = Kong Forever #TeamKong #GodzillaXKong #ValentinesDay
This looks good
2:27 There's mini kong in the middle but he doesn't move at all 😂
Next film, it's them against the Kaijus from the Moon, or from Mars, I'm already predicting that.
Boring
THIS IS PURE EPIC CINEMATOGRAPHY 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💀🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Gua nga setuju soal the great ape become human protector humaniti.. Salah ini.. Dri dlu godzilla nga di anggap ka ngelindugin mereka.. Mulai dri muto, king gidora atau titan titan lain..
Kolleh mass saar'eh🔥🔥🔥
Godziila and Kong just like me and my brother :D:
Godzilla, Kong, Skar King, Shimo The Four Titãs!❤
EPIC CAN'T WAIT
Damn, this looks insane, I can’t wait to watch it!
Time to waste time and money and Asian know the King Kong language wow
best movie i think for my opinion!!!! LOVE IT
love it❤
YOOO THERES TITANUS SHIMU
Kong is about to be King Kong after this , although I can't help to ask but Godzilla in pink almost like the American adaptation of shin Godzilla
I CANT WAIT THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE AWESOME!!
Nice video 📷📷
The ocean is out of space
Bruh! Kong got the Giant Gauntlet and Godzilla got the Rage Vile from Clash Of clans 😅...
I don't know, looks too childish to me.
Where did GOJO come from 1:14
Sorry Godzilla running looks stupid.
I just can't suspend belief enough to see apes swinging swords.... Everything else I'm cool with though lol😅
Now i got it why kong get new gauntlet.... He lost his hand🥲damm
Boring voice over
who is waiting for shimu
Mothra!?
Shimo at 2:27 watch on 0.25
This might be the first time honest trailers has enough to work with before the movie even released
Di detik 0.31 keliatan jelas kalo kong vs skarking, Godzilla vs shimu wah gila sih nih film
Was I the only one that noticed Kong with the Leviathan Axe??
Did they really had to destroy the pyramids?!
Dude THIS WAS OUR FIRST LOOK OF SHIMO
Ada 2 godzilla 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This gonna be crazy!
2:27 That punch on Skar King is VICIOUS
Omg.. Can't wait for this masterpiece 😍
This trailer is EPIC 🤯🤯🤯
Epic epic epic Awesome
The trailer pretty much gave the movie away
The internet is gonna explode today!!!
Kong: I am inevitable
Its over like old cartoons act 🤮🤮🤬
They probably stop fighting half way because mothra came in and make them behave
മാരക ഐറ്റം 🩷✨🔥
Monke💪💪💪
Omg this is gonna be awesome to watch in theater
I feel like I saw whole Movie😊❤ thank You Warner Bros
Every time you see an infinity gauntlet joke about the movie 👇
🎉🎉🎉finally，I can not wait😊
Godzilla fears no one
0:11
Kong in real life live in my village😅
Shimu❤️
With global warming and increasing temperatures the world needs Shimo who can cool the planet off for good !
❤
Rise together❌ RUN Together✅
2:26 you all can check Shimu face clearly at extreme right side slow video to 0.25x when Kong is going to punch scar king 😊
amaizing... can't wait to watch this movie
Ohhh god damnnnnnnn WTF I can't wait for this 😵‍💫
Oh...goosebumps
Kong: The new empire of the planet of the apes
Did anyone notice shimu
جاااااان ❤❤❤
I live to see Godzilla and Kong in Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷
This and Deadpool 3, only thing I'm looking forward to and actually only 2 movies I know coming out this year...  Side note, Anybody else feel "The New Empire" "Age of Ultron" "Age of Extinction" etc. all end up being like 2 or 3 days at maximum? It's so silly. The Dark Knight Rises feels like more time passed than Ultron's 2 days of "Age of Ultron".... anyway, maybe time will pass in this one
If they ruin this movie by putting feminism in it like giving that girl superpowers and making her the girlboss key to everything i am gonna lose it!
noice
Cornier planet of apes.
All good but the music is sooo loud
I have just one question- Why does Hollywood wanna keep breaking the great pyramids like it is just some normal pile of rocks in it's movies?
OMG…Zilla!! ❤
Theory: the Godzilla with blue atomic form is maybe godzilla isn’t still evolved because when he dives int he water you can see the dorsal plates are the design for godzilla 2019-2021 so the blue form is not evolved then maybe he trapped himself in ice then evolved.
So cool
this will be epic. cant wait.....
Ab aayega mazaa😱
Ye kya babaal hai bhai 👍👍
amazing 😮
Interesting 😊😊😊
опять приключения лилипутов в стране гигантов
I will team up with skar king and shimu. Most badass combination. Shimu and skar king together will beat kong and Godzilla
Goku: super Saiyan blue with red 🔥 Godzilla: super Saiyan blue with rose  🔥
whats your vfx budget ? Adam Wingard : yes
Thanos Kong, rose Godzilla against a giant orangutan... I'm definitely excited for that😂
❤
DAGON
It a JOKE compared to the 2014 Godzilla movie.
so whats the idea of these movies?
2:13 anyone noticed Skar or Scar king standing there if you zoom in on the YouTube app you will be able to see that. Seems like we could see a fight between Shimo and Skar king too. Finger crossed 🤞.
This is going to be a KOTM level movie
Boycott USA 🇺🇸 movies and companies to stop genocide in gaza
Can't wait for the new epic Godzilla movie 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wtf! Move over Deadpool coz for me this looks like film of the year. Untill this trailer it was Deadpool and wolverine I was more hyped to see but damn bro 🤯🤯🤯🤯
So Kong is the cool uncle who live alone in the Upper earth and only visits when something important happens, sounds like we are all wann be  kongs ha ha
Godzilla decided to turn off Barbie mod
Just wait untill the justice league shows up too
Goosebumps 🔥
Lil monkey name gonna be George or something

"Monsters go brrr"
YOOO godzilla in super saiyan blue form is epic!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Holy craft!...this is awesome!..i want to see shimu's face
Guys Godzilla got atomic pulse attack
The battle begins
Unity is strength
Idhekkadi mass ra ayya
Why did they show the whole movie
Repeating the same nonsense
Great
That running scene is kinda corny in both trailers but overall this movie is looking epic! I am actually excited to see a movie in theaters, been a while!
Godzilla x kong ek cheez maine notice ki ke Godzilla naam ke words thode chote hai kong naam ke words thode bade hain toh isi liye yeh movie kong ki hone wali hai
This is not the Infinity Gauntlet ) this is a prosthetic
Hopeless CGI
Kong is now powerful as he can just snap all opposition away
Yassssssss
What is that 😮 introducing shimo🤯
Not in the mood for a love story. Sorry.
Mehh .. watch on ipad on the couch on a wednesday afternoon at best.
it would be more perfect if they used apple vision pro :v
what is bigger than kong zilla , the stare at first by kong istooo largee ///
Yaey godzillas still blue
Kong is thanos and Godzilla is wanda
now someting intereziting
Monsterverse. Minedless action. I feel like that defeats the whole idea of Godzilla movies.
my question is. what the work of dagon head?
Godzilla looks more agile and proportion than before to evolve l.
I really like the first films in the Legendary series. However, this film somehow... doesn't look right to me. As if the Godzilla franchise was following the path of the Transformers films of the time, where each successor became louder and louder, but also increasingly stupid. But tastes are different. I'd rather stick with Minus One and the older Legendary films.
✨️ ✨️ ✨️
Godzilla oda ex dhn kong ah 😱 ❣️
Brooooo is that shimu
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆☠️☠️☠️
planet of apes look great
Kong Bhaiya Khud Thanos se Infinity Gauntlet banwa kar laye hai 😂
SHIMO APPROVED
Two of the Greatest Titans to every do it, Man this got me feeling like Saturday morning in the 70's. Kong and Zilla best to do it hands down.
MINI KONG...OMG!!!!😭
GODZILLA the KING of all Titanss!!!!
Daaaaaaam 😮
YO THAT NEW BLUE GODZILLA LOOK IS CRAZY, I’m digging it, it’s literally blue thermo goji 😂   He even got a pulse!
From the near death experience Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Blue as well
Super saiyan rose Godzilla let's gooo
I just hope both Kong and Godzilla survive 🥲
Omg
Kong went HAM... lol cool trailee
Wooooooooohhhh!! yeeaahhh baby that's what I am talking about
Something that can scare both Godzilla and Kong it could only be Anguirus truly the most powerful and fiendish enemy Godzilla ever faced
The monsterverse films have been uneven in quality however this looks dope
2:47 this scene was cold af
Team kong
Rebecca Hall’s hair stylist should’ve been fired!
next we need Transformers X Godzilla X Kong
Gillsih
VFX🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We want the monster of movie Godzilla king of all monsters as Godzilla team ❤
Epicardo
if you pause it when the girl is thinking she is mad you can see shimu!
This looks horrible.... And I'm definitely going to see it.
I cannot wait to see this movie
It's been a long time since that a good movie has a nice spoiler free trailer
0:30
Տuper
Question: What can we see in the trailer? Answer: Everything except shimu!
Ahhhh🔥
OMG wowowowoow
Legendary Greatest titans  Huge expectations from this one  This movie create history nd Godzilla nd kong milke hi avatar ka record todenge ek din  #monter universe 😮
More hollywood garbage. Go watch godzilla minus one instead
Why won't you learn.
This is exactly the kind of nonsense that has ruined Hollywood creativity. Kong, Alien, Predator and Godzilla has eaten up a large chunk of creative space in the last few decades...with little to no entertainment.
A very predictable progression from the previous film. A different coloured ape, because ape racism, right? A different glow to Godzilla, because merch, right? I really hope there's a decent story in here, but it doesn't look like it, just more of the same.
Whos the villain?
Looks like a fan made Looks good though
Europe and America really love monkeys...
2:13 omagash shimu😮
dai padatha othikatingalae daaa
That’s Theatrical Experience 💯🔥🤌🏻✅
I'm seriously so hyped for this next installment!🔥Kong got the infinity gauntlet lol😂
This is basically ross and Rachel season 3 😂
🔥 Whoa! This trailer is straight fire! 🦍🐲 Can't wait for the ultimate showdown between Godzilla and Kong! 🎬
Let's hope it wasn't gonna flop.
Godzilla & Gorilla vs Orangutan & Godzilla (Secret Enemy )
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
2:50 You can see clearly at kongs  teeth....it was broken during his fight in hollow earth with scar king....and here on earth he takes his revenge for that teeth 😍🔥🔥🔥
Its Doomfist!!!!! Its from fortnite!
Sounded so earrape hear 2:33
Aaaaaaa Jiaaa I LOVE YOU 🥰🥰🥰🥰

Legendary, plz next time when u made the titans fight in Brazil, made them fight in Brasilia! PLZ! HAHAHAHAHAHA
I don't know how long they're going to squeeze this franchise. It is so cringe. The same story every time. Look at how different Godzilla Minus One was.
goofy and meh! boring, bad cgi
0:31 You can see Godzilla fighting with Shimu.
i sense TRASH!
This looks like such a wild ride. Can't wait.
Big version of Thanos
Where is the Shimu ?
Kong with infinity gauntlet is gonna be the bomb!
The amount of destruction in this trailer is amazing
Dude Shimo is gonna look soo cool and SICK man!
Is it just me or does kong look like idris elba
Thank you Adam Wingard😊 Judging by Last Movie We Already Know How this is Going to be.Hope You Stick Around for this Franchise for many More Kaiju Action.
Finally some snippets of Shimo, let's go!
VFX off the roof 🎉
Records breaking trailer 😮😮
they went too far with these movies! it's like they stop!
Godzilla is the king of monsters
Already can tell the human characters and dialogue will be utter dogsh*t, like in all of these western monster flicks.
Think I'll wait for someone to react to this in a year.
make it sub one and half hour and i will watch it...
Let’s go
Wow
Omg 😮  so cool 😎 Osam good exilent 🎉❤😊  mind blowing badass I am so happy too se this trailer thank you so much monster universe 😊

Go***la Vera level
2:52 no one notice who is in the middle down? Is it scar king?
I'm so proud that I don't watch such kind of movies. 😂
Kong and Zilla running beside eachother is just absolutely deadly !
Kong Vs Godzilla ❌ Kong and Godzilla Vs Scarking and Shimo ✅
whoever complains about the vfx are just people whos here to spreading hate
NAH THIS IS WAY MORE HYPE
Godzilla got nerfed looks like it based on the previous movie alone. smh.
This is going to be epic 🔥🔥
Don't show the whole movie in a trailer Goddamit...
As much as i love Godzilla and Kong, WTF with that crappy CGI?
Periodt
G 😮😮
🥶TITANUS SHIMO🥶
Team Kong 💪🔥
cant wait to warch the movie
Nice.
So if I get this right; a new Kong rises and King Kong and Godzilla must team up in order to stop this new Kong... Gonna be lit🥶😤🔥
On your face Marvel...on your face!!!
Widih anjay.. kong sarung tangan besi.. bikin merinding sumpah gua 👍👍

Who ready for trailer 2!?
Godzilla and XKong teaser always gives me a goosebumps ❤
This gonna be the best movie of 2024 I can feel it
Tiger X Pathan : The New Empire
i hate how the monsterverse became more of a sci fi franchise than a monster movie franchise
we hope it's not as bad as godzilla vs kong 2022 or godzilla: king of the monster 2019
Even kong got woke bracelet.
2:27 you can see the shimu on the right
🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨

BIG BUDGET CHEEEEESE
These movies are getting even more stupid!
YOOOOOOO LETS FRICKIN GOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!😝😝😝🤩🤩🤩
Godzilla and Kong vs. Hulk and Superman.  LOL.
Wont be anywhere as good as Godzilla minus one
this movie is getting ridiculous
Please reduce the human drama and give us some terrific kaiju battle
Now this is cinema 😮
A blockbuster on the way
Shimo face reveled exact on starting time 2:27 right side, Kong tooth was broken and replaced by silver tooth 2:50.
This is kinda goofy. Minus 1 is more realistic feeling
thank god, one lesser annoying character
I hate trailers, they always make times go slower until the release date.
Shimo is confirmed!!
Godzilla : Are you King Kong because you’re the strongest or are you the strongest because you’re King Kong
ULTRA MAN IS COMING.😂
Yo shimo
Camera man never dies.
Why is Godzilla a blue version of Thermo
Lame… goin to bed

It was epic and I can't wait to watch it! What is the blue eyes thing, someone tell me if u guys know?
Godzilla Minus One Set Up The Bar So High They Will Never Reach. This Gonna Flop, And I'm Here For It
That's too much for me! The visuals, the cinematography, the sounds, the action scenes....just too much for me!
The battle will be legendary😁
Wait.... To see if kong's axe destroyed by shimu's breath??   This is my theory

I am inevitable!
Kong looks op😅
Man, remember when humans had like standard military tech? Yea me neither

🔥🔥🔥
This movie comes too fanatsy
ITS OFFICIAL SHIMO AKA ICE GODZILLA WILL BE IN THE MOVIE I SAW A SHIMO GODZILLA X KONG KEYCHAIN WHOS HYPED FOR THIS MOVIE
What's next? Avengers will show up? 😅 I hate it, but the cgi is good.

Lets go

anyone else came In in their pants ? or was it just me
YE BAAT TOH CONFIRM HOGYI KI SHIMU HAI

the bad guy looks like a junkie kong, cringe.
If curious george met every titan ever george would win big diff
Kong became Thanos and chasing Godzilla
This looks terrible
What video game was this? Cool graphics but RDR2 is better. I have a PS4- can I play this game?
Not again….who keeps funding these? Has to be money laundering.
Favorite trailer since tf5 and interstellar
Plz WB try to start pop king michel jackson biography movie ❤
Ok so it is the oxygen destroyer
Hey look, they made a Triangle Vs Monkey Live action Movie.
I’m going to see this, now is it as good as minus one - of course not. Not even close to the same level. In my opinion, Minus one was the best film of 2023 but there is always a place for a good ole monster movie. This is it.
This is wild
How did we go from Gareth Edward's gritty realism to this kids show?
2:27 kong hits scarking with a haymaker
The eternals were there..they just don’t wanna interfere
Damn, ive always loved the sfx in this movie
Theater March 29..... Torrent 4k April 20 :-)
Omg there’s gonna be a ice Kaiju 1:53
Should I watch monarch or skip before this movie
2:27 Aint no way Kong punched skar king that hard to make a tooth come out💀
BRO GODZILLA WENT SUPER SAYIAN BLUE!!!!!!!!!
meu amigo esse soco do kong senti daqui
This is gonna be epic
Damn that was pretty epic. I'm actually excited for this.
Nte ponnaliyaa poli😂❤❤❤
I don't know why but I feel like they are hiding something big
🎉🎉🎉🎉
*This movie has Transformer vibes*
Dil Khud Hogaya Bhai ❤❤❤❤❤
Wtf was that' bro 🥶
Fck Yeah!
hype!
Kong Fan's Assemble
Godzilla x Kong in the multiverse of skull-crushing lets freaking go😂😂
pause exactly at 0:31. its not a 2v1 its a 2 v 2. lessgoo!!!!
😂
This is a good trailer, its just they shown so much
FIRST OF ALL I LOVED SEEING KING'S REACTION WHEN GOJI ARRIVED😂 AND SECONDLY I GOT AN IDEA HOW STRONG SCAR WILL BE THAT KONG BREAK HIS TEETH WITH SINGLE PUNCH😂
Super hype for Godzilla x Kong movie
Good thing they showed us the entire movie in advance!!
You can see mothra in 29 in a eye
Kong rlly needed a power gauntlet huh
তৃষা বিয়ে করছে।
I love how silly this is😂😂
Complete Adrelene rush throughout the trailer ❤❤❤
He's not Alone.....GOOSEBUMPS
This is sick
When Kong uses the 6 stones oh no
Godzilla super nuclear amp with blue pulses
2 hours of CGI for dumb people who like dumb unoriginal films.
Family.
SHIMU
Cool 😍
So kong now has a power fist?, awesome
Just give the whole Iron man suit to King Kong.. Stop wasting his time by giving parts by parts.. The Iron Kong Suit I mean...
wow.........
All is missing in Kong's gauntlet is the Infinity Stones.
This will be epic..😍
Kya aj mera 290 Subscribers hoga?😂
2:28 the tooth is the funniest part to me lol
This looks amazing.
Can't wait can't wait can't wait🥵🥵
I am so hyped. ...
A kaiju size power glove???? opproved!!👍
this so dumb
1v1 gonna be epic
🔥🔥🔥
Daaaaaaamnnn!!! Lets goo! Im hyped for thiss!!
Yeah I’m SO gonna watch this film.
1:22
Who used that lce beam 💀
Gorila vs orangutan
Oh my god!😮
Soooo Godzilla is blue and pink now?
Looks boring compared to Minus One ngl
Viet Nam???
Ok, lets take the Story of "Iron Man, King Kong , Godzilla, Parcifc Rim  and Edge of tomorrow " and make a new useless movie out of it.... yeah !
Imagine Kong with the gauntlet says: "Fine, I'll do it myself 😌"
2:05 is it just me who I think how the godzilla move look like human? I hope so because if it not...I have bad feeling about this
Amazing ❤❤
This trailer showed too much. They pulled a DC lol.
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and NOW THIS ??? WB u good at DESTROYING CHARACTER
I can’t not wait to see this in theatres 🤯
If i feel goosebumps while watching the trailer then what will happen while watching the movie 🥶🥶🥵🥵
Every next godzilla movie by WB seems to be more stupid. In next movie humanity will build spaceships for godzilla and king kong to send them to the moon to fight giant wombats. Of course they will have to send a little girl or some other kiddo with them as well.
you know hollywood and all of movie-making itself is in a really poor state when you anticipate the next godzilla/king kong movie
0:18 g'man looks badass
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
This looks awful
Idk how many times Godzilla save the humans and they still attacked Godzilla. Very not coool
OMG this looks too epic!!
the movie promises to be epic, that's all I'm waiting for
The trailer is so long and the practically show most of the fights it feels like I watched the movie already but of course I watch it anyways.
Are they Fighting Destroyah?
looks terrible
0:31 bro what is that thing fighting Godzilla?
this looks it's gonna be one of the movies to ever exist.
can this be the ending scene? 2:52
Unbelievable trailer are u kidding me this movie gonna be awesome!!
Kong is him!😂
Finally Godzilla became comedian 😢😢😢
they made godzilla woke thats crazy
Sheesh 🔥
minius one
Lmao they are fighting the Beast Titan
army of kongs
why are they so small bruh
Ooohhh the hype... Damnnnnn
How many of you noticed Shimo
They turned Kong into a transformer. :(
Damn I cannot wait for this 😭
And that's what is called a trailer. Just loved it
Props to the camera man, yet again.
Can we go back to simpler times when movies were standalone and stakes weren't always earth shattering without all this shared universe bs. Im tired 😫
I ordered the Godzilla minus one action figure. 😊😊😊
Can't wait until they introduce time travel and we get Planet of the Apes x Godzilla 😂
This version Godzilla so pathetic and weak can't believe they made tiny Godzilla while Kong similar height as Godzilla that's why I love japanese Godzilla
It's going to be legendary.I can't wait for this.
These r the new Transformers movies
Baby Kong aur Gulabi Chhipkali🤣🤣🤣
Almost looks as bad as a Disney movie, all we need is a woke character and..DONE. This looks boring af. I feel sorry for people who actually think they like this awful CGI manifesto with bad writing.
Vi kong
Why is there a Minecraft beacon noise at 0:21
L trailer
This is copy of latest Transformer
so cool
This looks awful.
Needs more CGI
Bruhhhhh 🤯
2 Godzilla 1 pink female  and 1 Blue Male 1 Kong 1 Baby Kong 1 Shimu 1 Mothara in this movie
I sold.
Looks like a sequel to Planet of the Apes: Titan edition.
1:51
1,51
Who else find running godzilla is so fricking cute?
She looks like malnutritioned Scarlett Johansson 😂
In kong's place
May hero Godzilla
SHIMO I CAN'T WAIT HAHA
Is it the titan that the eyes are blue and hiding in shadow also freeze breathd is shimo?
they are just too big. imagine man caring for an ant, that's impossible. trying to wrap my head around it.
Minus one kinda saved this film. When the first trailer dropped I cringed so hard but now that I've seen Minus one and It's been so well recieved in the US I'm actually pretty excited to see this one! Still hate evolved Godzilla's skinny legs though. LETS SEE MONKE AND LIZARD SMASH TOGETHER!!!
Kong with the power fist is super epic!
I had a dream 29th March is tomorrow😅
Shimu face
Godzilla x King Kong Fast and Furious 20 Infinity War
Whole movie in one trailer😂
Sebenernya godzila itu baik apa jahat yak? Dari film awal tidak nampak dia berbuat baik 😂😂
Kaylee OMG💖💖💖
Damn the goosebumps,,,💪🏻💪🏻
Barbie Godzilla 😅
Am i the only one who thinks godzilla is suppose to be spooky, scary and dark not as colourful like avatar....
Leave Egypt alone
anyone know what's the name of the new blue form of godzilla?
Shimu ☠️
Yeah mowne 👌🔥
Pause at 0:31 to see a sneek peak of the fight.
This movie is coming up on March 29. My birthday is coming in March 19. *This is the best birthday present ever*
0:51 godzilla kinda not looking good here  thE CGI
Godzilla can still be blue???
So, scar king is belmont Godzilla is super saiyan ego Kong has infinity gauntlet Boy what's going on 🤣
I was hoping theyd team up! letss gooooo!!!!
1:54 whos this?
Knowing that SH Monsterarts didn't lie and that he can go between his standard blue and pink, I REALLY hope he is Pink for a majority of the movie because that pink look is too good to be only for the trailers
Cant wait!!! Kong TEAMM!
Godzilla not even flinching at missiles anymore 😲
This going be the best Kong ever ❤ thnx guys for it
Movie spoiler ::::: "KONG" is more powerful than "GODZILLA "
WHOS HYPED FOR THIS 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
Cringe
So where is all that light in the hollow world coming from. Do they have sunsets there? 😆🤣
Godzilla X Kong: Brothers of Destruction
Epic just wowww
The fact that when kong punched star king so hard his tooth fell out was not even the hand with the beast glove in it
That's awesome 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Its morbin time..

What has this made brother, goosebumps in the entire trailer, what will happen in the movie, I can't wait.
Best movie in monstervers
Magnificent
THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE LITTTTT CANT WAIT!!!
2:26 Titanus shimo face revealed
This Trailer Is My Dopmaine Rush.  Amazing.
“Wow” :/  amazing people getting paid for this too.
this is more than too much
Wow so cool
Title should have been "KONGZILLA"
2:29 ...is that skar king's tooth 🥵
The start of a great movie and the next step of the Monsterverse
Where is mothra😢
trailer cringe for bring up there rivalry again we had that last movie now there friends and i hope that rumor quote about them being like buddy cops is true cuz i just want em to be friends now with kong rinding godzilla into battle and then godzilla rides kong into battle :3
Scar king the bill collector came for kongs bills 💵
Very good
Will the battle be structured as Godzilla vs. Sim, Kong vs. Scar King?
You know you got a great entrance when you're an ice titan coming out of lava falls Shimo looks like a real threat to both
Can't wait !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro...... Godzilla been spamming his super saiyan transformation since he faught Gidorah........ Ssj, ssj blue, ssj rose.... What's next? Ultra instinct?
There better be a scene where Kong and Godzy fist bump
Shiny is conformed less goo
L
can;t wair more
Godzilla looks so blue in one of the parts he looks like he’s about to explode😮😮😮😮😮😮
waw Shimo freezes Kong 0:30
I feel good for the next generation of 20's they finally get to experience being amazed by captivating cinema
This team must grow bigger for the future enemy Titans or Alien invasion . Kong, Godzilla and..a Giant Eagle for air support
Cinema
Godzilla went Super Saiyan & Kong gets an Infinity Gauntlet
the dialogue is so cheese i can't 😂😂😂
Going to have less than 32% rotten tomatoes watch
SHIMO..!!!
mind blowing editor and vfk keka
Esto es la mayor bazofia que he visto en mucho tiempo.... Se ha perdido el gusto por el buen cine, ir a ver esta pelicular es similar a ir a comer una hamburguesa al MC donald´s. El tema es exprimir la vaca hasta que se quede seca, es indiferente ensuciar personajes e historias épicas, el objetivo aquí es producir contenido basura para gente descerebrada, si lo mejor que nos podría pasar es extinguirnos.
"Something even they are afraid of" -- not really sure godzilla is capable of feeling frightened
More garbage
Now that is super Epic
Are there 2 Godzillas in this film or am I wrong?
MILK THIS FRANCHISE MORE GUYS.......
I really wish they would ditch this cringe human drama sub plot and just make a movie about monsters fighting each other.
A MASTERPIECE ......  CAN'T WAIT !!!
watching the monster is cool, but i already see theres will be another stupidly boring human drama
What a trailer cuts... Urges to watch the movie sooner on bigger screen.
Second Trailer But Why??🤔
1:54 wtf is that ????
Bro this movie will be epic
Trash
This movie break all records ❤
Why second trailer???🤔
2 many Godzilla? Pink and blue
Fine.... So next time is who's turn fight with godzilla & king kong? Issit ultraman or dragon ball?
Apna Karan Arjun agia 😅😂 🤣
なんかもう、WWEみたくなっちゃってるんだよなぁ
Hello ❤❤❤

We need kong
How many malayalis are watching this 💥
Can’t wait
Is it just me or the godzilla roaring kinda sounds like moistcritikal clip
Two Godzilla

CGI DE-Evolved in this movie
are you going to keep Scratching this movie?
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🤯😵😵😷💥💥💥💥💦🌟♥️🙌🏻👌🏻
Is this a movie for big kids. Monsters fighting each other for no reason.
bruh i can't  wait
Erm wait so who’s the bad guy now ? Neither.. please explain.
Let them fight -Serizawa
The fact that kong knocked out one of skar kings teeth makes me believe there's gonna be so much carnage in this movie
This, apes and Deadpool all in the same year. It’s time to go back to the cinema. 👏
Seems there are two Godzillas too
牢大！
Why would human like to watch monsters tearing each other apart ?   Because that's what mankind are doing to each others 😂
To bad Millie Bob Brown isnt in it
Kong lost the axe?!?!
The corporate-backed spam comments praising a mindless, A.I. written, algorithm driven, bad CGI filled, overly commercialized excuse for a film that's not even out yet, like a cow suckling from its own utter, is clear evidence that we've peaked as a civilization...  Really? Even after Godzilla Minus One?  Yet so many people, as so many factory farm pigs, will be presented with such slop and shall inevitably and greedily gorge themselves — consuming every last bit until satiated ever so briefly until the next serving of cheaply made, easy to consume, and mind-numbing schlock.  You have so many hours left to live this one life you have, why waste it staring at a screen filled with this?
Milte hai theatre me 2 March ko
Could've taken any name but Godzilla x Kong...
From brilliant, exciting Monster Horror we are now moving towards stupendous Michael Bay action... what a shame :(
2:33 WTF (boom) meme 😂
I thought this is a shipped because there is a x but who cares i like it and yeah i like the trailer
What is the release date of this movie ???
My birthday present instead of ps5

This might be the first time I go to the theater drunk to watch a movie.
your showing a bit to much where they hype if you shoe half the fight
Epic,Epic,Epic  cant wait man!!
Kong with Infinity Gauntlet, Super Saiyan Rose Godzilla, Furious Gore (Curious George) and Larger Version of Gamera.  Seems legit. ❤❤❤
Sasa hii ndio inabamba😁😁😁

You just had to put everything in the trailer?
0:00 Kong Rises From Hollow Earth To Egypt  0:12 Godzilla Roaming Earth  0:28 Deaf Girl starts seeing stuff  0:30 Quick Glimpse Of The Future   0:49 Kong, Godzilla start feeling stuff  1:05 Entering Hollow Earth  1:20 Kong Jr  1:25 Possible MOTHRA Egg  1:27 Scar King Hand Print  1:30 The New Empire  1:42 How Kong Breaks His Hand aka Scar King vs Kong  1:50 Shimu Teaser  2:11 Shimu’s Ice Abilities  2:20 Godzilla Vs Kong 2??  2:27 Kong absolutely violates either Scar King or a disciple by knocking his tooth out ( cartoon style )   2:31 somehow Godzilla’s the enemy 💀 ( New Ability Unlocked )  2:36 Godzilla Explodes Similarly to how he created a Mothra spirit when he went Thermonuclear/ also Mothra’s human followers introduced  2:38 Kong and Kong Jr will have a Ellie and Joel relationship  2:43 Kong’s nanotechnology ahh cast 💀🙏
Holy f-k yeah

2:54 Just that song made me have so many goosebumps Epic song ever!
damnn
2:17 DIDNT THEY TAKE DOWN MECHAGODZILLA TOGETHER THOUGH?!
Kong and Godzilla vs Beast titan
Ah yes. A King Kong-Godzilla buddy cop movie!
VFX at the peak
猿の群れが相手とかどうでもいいわ　今回はハズレかな
TEAM BRING IT
Frost Godzilla ? 💀
TRASH. Keep it simple.
Not gonna lie this looking horrible compared to the first movie 🤨
😂 director fulfilling his childhood dreams
Put Jetpack Kong so he can fight Megatron soon
Иногда напоминает эльфятину из комиксовых супергероев со сверхспособностями.
WHY I NO ONE SCREAMING IN THE CHAT WHEN THEY SAW SHIMU?!!!
CGI looks so bad and generic
Looks fun but not entirely sure how i feel lmao
Goosebumps... every second...🔥🔥🔥
pink godzilla = mind control
I'm Going To See That Movie 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
Very bad trailer cut.. Revealed everything..
Godzilla and Kong has become the modern-day Goku and Vegeta. I don't care how cheesy or corny it is but my inner child is jumping in joy right now  🤣
I love godzilla
This is why we used to go to the movie theater. Pure action. Finish 3 bags of popcorn EASY.
Literal goosebumps
Günaydın ilgi çekici film dir
2:39 BONK!!
What is that shooting ice beams 🤔
why does godzilla new roar sound like the moist critical scream meme
THIS HAS EVERYTHING WE EVER WANTED.......... RELEASE IT NOW, TODAY, AT THIS VERY MOMENT....
Good CGI bad story. Just like first movie.
29 March my birthday🎉🎉🎉🎉
Man sad.. man see Godzilla and Kong fighting side by side.. man happy
Can't Wait🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is becoming more bizzare and bizzare with each go😂❤
officially in cartoon territory
Love these, but please let us get some more classic villains. There are so many great ones to choose from like Gigan, Space Godzilla, or Destoroyah! Would love to see them modernized on the big screen.
Kong👇       🦍🦖       Godzilla👇
1:48 Is that shimu ???
Would've like to see Shimu not look almost exactly like godzilla
another pile😅
RIP the VFX Simulations team
I loveee this movie!!
The iron fist is insane. The Beast Team is WILD
Why they make Bridges? So that it can be broken by a giant creature, As a ritual. 😂
Me
Ithu theernille ithuvare
I swear we better get Mothra this time
imagine watching this pile of garbage after having seen Godzilla Year One! Hollywood is creatively bankrupt.
👍👍
This is insane it's giving me chills 🥶
1:30 mini kong cute voice 😂
LETS GO MY MANS IS BLUE AGAIN NO MORE GODZILLA BEHIND THE SLAUGHTER
Nice I think everyone knows Zilla is going to be added now
Wooow can’t wait to watch a remake for the 804755281th time. 🙃
this is so dumb yet so cool...love it
Looks so dumb it has to be fun. Must see.
Eagerly waiting ✌️
Dude. Im gonna cry when monsterverse ends. This is a masterpiece
Did kong just knocked out scar king's tooth?
We need Kong the world needs him
Now kong's mission is to pull out banana ⚰️💀.
Bro, this is LIT💥
2:26 is that mini kong?
2:12 Shimo can fly!?!?
With this movie and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, this might as well be Year of the Monkey and not dragon
Godzilla and Kong team up before GTA 6
Trailer was a mind blowing ❤🎉
1:58 Guess thats the reason why Kong needs the gauntlet, his arm got frozen and injured here by Shimo
AVENGERS ASSEMBLE !
They gave kong a gauntlet and made Gojira super saiyaan, a monkey and lizard movie did the Multiverse thing better than Marvel post Endgame
😮😮😮😮
Monsters Movie fan can assemble here 👇
I hope mini kong gets smooshed
I thought that shimo was white and walked on 4 legs but then i lookt closer and i saw that shimo an godzilla is
1:51 wtf is that??
I’m so excited 🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨
🔥🔥🔥
Her : We've made some minor augmentation He : You f***ing gave him a gaunlet  😂😂
❤❤❤
They are gonna keep on making it, and I'm gonna keep on watching it.🦍🦖
Forget Avengers level threat, it's Titan level threat now!
That girl giving vibes of eco series 😂
Ada gommale idh thaanda trailer 😮
Boom😵😵‍💫⚡⚡⚡⚡
I still can't get used to Godzilla running. You are KING. Kings don't run. They stride and intimidate their enemies.
💗GODZILLA 💗
Shimo is finally revealed but not completely but I can see his eyes and his ice frost heat ray
Its not right sorry ill watch it but i bet minus one is way better
2:53 the money shot right there.
2:34 mothra?
Can't wait
MONKE AND LIZARD GO BRR
Pure goosebumps
So hyped for this movie cannot wait! And the upgrades look amazing!!
They made kong into doomfist 💀
Big monke
What is the thing that Kong is scared of 1:53
🔥 🔥 🔥
I’m really so excited to watch this movie ❤❤❤❤❤
I'm anxious to see this and my mom loves these godzilla and Kong movies she gunna love this one
It's not Godzilla x Kong It's Zilla of Kong ❤
Yeahhhhh Kong the Vegeta of the Monster verse,, seriously bro just wait for gok- i mean godzilla
In the next sequel they’ll have Kong, Godzilla and a bunch of Titans combined into a Titanzord like the og power rangers megazord combined with the Dragonzord and Titanus.
The f I wrong with movies these days
Some wtf fiction film. Why you make it? I think it's because people are too dumb to watch it too.
Theater experience 💯💯💯🔥
Can't wait till kong has a big ak47
The ultimate battle of the Titans! Kong and Godzilla charging in together is pure excitement!
Not here for the plot, I wanna see three titans go toe to toe
Can we get a solid Godzilla city smasher or monster brawler to go with this movie? thanks
Mothera Is Back In Emipere New Godzilla So cool  Like Back Blue Turn Level Gound
Big monke smash things I like 😮
whew, it's a good thing godzilla and kong's mothers share the same name
Godzilla Watched Too Much David Goggins
Eagerly waiting 💥🥵
whats your vfx budget ? Adam Wingard : yes
HOLY SNCHIDER
Masss, MARANA MASSS
This is stupid 😂😂😂😂😂
When is the movie release date? 😊 ❤Godzilla's form is terrifying and majestic
Im actually excited for this movie, the monsters are the main focus and the humans are secondary.
W trailer
Is it me, or did they put the glove/brace thing on the wrong arm of kong? They show his left arm getting injured but put the glove/brace on his right arm. Assuming of course that it was meant as a brace or whatever to help his injury, which if it is it's gonna bug me so much that it's on the wrong arm.
.......still looks better than Madam Web.
Where's the heart button? This is top notch excitement and VFX. My kind of picture.
better than mcu bruh
So much cringe, I can't wait to watch the reviews for this movie since they will probably be more entertaining than the movie itself lol
my inner child is screaming his head off. i'm screaming too, but he's way louder.
Godzilla and kong having a Goku and Vegeta relationship
2:27 Shimu
The radiant blue one looks like a skin from shark bite
Shimu is finally here
Even though Godzilla running is kinda weird but this movie is still sick, can’t wait to watch it!
I can already tell the worst parts and most focused are going to be the humans...again.
Man this is gonna be a super dope movie!!! Can't wit to see it in the theater haven't been this excited since the endgame came out
2 godzillas⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
1:50 - So... Kong has heard or aware of Shimo's existence?
One criticism, TOO MANY F—KING HUMANS, you are not Godzilla Minus One, just own who you are and stop giving us human BS 1:53 is that evil Godzilla who is Scarking’s pet or just Godzilla? Pls be the first one, that would be the best & worst thing ever
Well that trailer was a hoot, a lot of nonstop Showa-esque action and insanity. Since there are so much new scenes and tidbits to be pointed out, I'll try to do the job myself so anyone would have a picture of what would happen in the film. So, beware of possible spoilers.     0:01 - 0:11 We see Kong, welding the B.E.A.S.T glove, appearing from a recently made Hallow Earth tunnel, most likely in search of Godzilla after narrowly avoiding death at the hands of Shimo and Skar King. The B.E.A.S.T may very well be a homage to Show Kong since he absorbed lighting and was able to discharge electricity through touch during his last fight with Showa Godzilla. 0:11 - 0:13 Godzilla swimming, in his pre evolved appearance, probably at Rome, Italy. 0:13 - 0:18 Godzilla, in his evolved appearance, mostly likely Egypt, most likely having sensed and hunting Kong 0:30 We see flashes of Mothra, Pre evolved Godzilla, apparently Godzilla directing Shimo's ice beam at Skar King and Suko's direction in Rio and Shimo's ice beam. 0:47 -  1:00 Kong at Rio? Godzilla leaving Rome, probably heading north to evolve. Perhaps Godzilla was on the search for Shimo since we see a tower of ice slicing through the ground and killing a civilian in the previous trailer. 1:34 Looks like Skar King has his own council or group of commanders by his side, like Megatron had with Starscream, Soundwave and Shockwave.  1:55 - 2:00 Looks to me that Kong's axe may very well be destroyed since we see him with the B.E.A.S.T glove and no axe after. 2:11 - 2:14 Shimo implementing a new ice age as part of Skar King's plan for global terraforming. 2:18 - 2:22 Even though they left in peace, it was still very much a truce. Godzilla and Kong still not seeing eye to eye. Likely that Kong will try to communicate with Godzilla to form an alliance to face their shared adversaries, since it's implied that Godzilla was hunting for Shimo. 2:27 - 2:29 Kong punching Skar King like the dickens, the tooth no doubt being a point which I'll explain later. 2:30 - 2:34 Pre evovled Godzilla at a industral site? Nuclear power plant? Taking down unmanned drones with a nuclear pulse. Pretty much what Godzilla's Burning form would've been without the Mothra powerup. As to why he's still causing destruction, terrorists? Anti - Titan activity? 2:38 - 2:40 Suko sticking it to one of Skar King's councilmean/commanders 2:50 We see Kong apparently having a silver tooth, implying that maybe he lost it during his fight fight with Skar King, hence the previous bit showing Kong returning the favor. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. 2:52 The obligatory Avengers assemble shot, nice to see Evovled Godzilla not being skinny as the toys have him with apparently no gut. We've seen skinny versions of Godzilla throughout a number of films. The 60 - 70's Showa films, Godzilla 2000: Millennium, Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla - Godzilla: Tokyo SOS and Godzilla Final Wars.

Any idea who is the hidden villian ,for whom Kong is afraid ? 😮
They fast and furioused Godzilla
After seeing the part where they comfirm shiml im so hyped that i might explode
i think we will have godzilla's twin that colored red.
It looked like Kong lost his left hand but the gauntlet is on the right so maybe no hands were lost,
Supperb
They are ready to fought a war once again.
A'm I banned from tube
The 2 tralier was amazing i loved it. I think that shimo is the one who breaks kong's arm and the Axe with his Ice breath . Watch it at 1:55 to 2:00 so that means Kong won the battle with Skar king   and was about to finish him then suddently he heard a strange roar thats when shimo showed up at and attack kong with his Ice Breath.
Is shimu there??
Is Godzilla and Kong friends or no
Its giving me "be greater together🕷" vibes
Goosebumps goosebumps it's not stopping. I can't wait for month, what a epic..😻

Kong buff 😂
Damn 👀🔥🔥🔥
Godzilla Minus One is still going to top this movie that had 3x its budget
so it's 2 vs 2 haha, Godzilla is fighting Shimu and Kong vs Scar King here even for a short period of time 0:30
Another girl who can understand an ape and blue fire breathing large creature.... nothing new
Bhaisaab maach#d diye 😂🙌🔥
Will definitely watch this
This movie better be above 2 hours or even longer than Godzilla 2 (2h 11min).
This is so dumb lmao
Absolute rubbish
I'm looking for Ceaser at the of the trailer though...
Is that Koba?
Goated
Wow
Not gonna complaint. I just want to book my ticket and watch it on 29th March. Done saving the date. Thank you!
Props to the camera man for surviving all that chaos.
Put some respect on Kong’s name for crying out loud
Who R they going up aginst... please tell me its not that red ape
0:49-0:51-0:52-0:54 Kong, Godzilla, they can feel it too 1:41-1:42 Skar King and Kong roar 1:48 what is that 2:00 Kong can’t stop this on his own 2:02 he won’t be alone 2:22-2:24 they don’t have to like each other, they just have to work together 2:27-2:28 Kong punches Skar King 2:33 Godzilla explodes 2:47-2:48-2:49 Skar King throws building 2:50-2:51 Kong punches building 2:52-2:53 Godzilla and Kong roar

Cameraman Never dies! 😂😜
Sounds like moist critical
I think chidorah will reappear 😮
Tamil fans here ❤
bro goosebumps
This trailer is insane wth
The look of sheer terror on kongs face when seeing the other monster is fantastic 😩😩😱😱
As a kid watching godzilla in the 80s. Was always my favorite and glad he's back.
Now monsters become human I still like Godzilla 1999
2 - godzillas 2- apes  😮😮😮
How many times can I not care about a King Kong vs Godzilla movie? One more apparently.
Mind blowing 🤯
That's awesome 💪
Kong looks great than godzilla...
It's Kong and Barbiezilla!
seriously ... im so dumb ..i dont understand,,whats the point of making this kind of movies these days
Definitely shimu with the ice blast
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I can wait to watch this movie!
I dont like the fast that the have made Godzilla so f**king op and only given king a gauntlet. At least he could have gotten his powers, either way I’m hyped for the movie
Ahora si viene lo chido
Kong got the Infinity Gauntlet and Godzilla tarnsformed into Super Saiyan Rose! damn everything in one movie❤ can't wait
Animation in movies is just getting worse.
I like the part where Godzilla destroyed a pair of drones at 2:31  Godzilla should destroy drones more often
Totally Goosebumps 🔥🔥
Here we go,song pls!!!!!
😮
Definitely excited to see this movie and watch Godzilla and Kong fight together ... but I would love to see Jet Jaguar in one of these movies
waiting kong x godzilla x dominic toretto
Nah this looks AWESOME.....THIS EXCITES THE INNER CHILD IN ME AND I'M DEF GOING TO BE IN THE FRONT ROW!!!!
This trailer looks so much better than the first one. I'm amazed. And the CGI seems to look better
Godzilla X Kong OTP
I am waiting 🔥
Wtf can't wait bro🔥🔥🔥
Bgm not good
2:33 i’m convinced that this sound is just a modified and distorted version of penguinz0 going “whooooooo yeah”
Godzilla was controlled by scarking at 2:20 thats why it was attacking kong?
Wooooh
So cool !! What is next ? Do we get a fusion dance and kong learns kamehameha wave ?
Plastic world
ROSÉ
Anyone notice mothra's face in the girls eye?👀🦋
GOOSEBUMPS OVERLOADED
I cant wait🔥
Why does godzilla roars sound like moistcriticals whooo meme?
no no no aii !!!!, never, never shame
Who here cannot wait for this movie? Because I can't, hyped to see more Godzilla and King action.
Congrats on being #1 on Trending Legendary and Warner Bros
Hace poco volví a ver la de Godzilla la primera de estos y no se le están metiendo mucha mamada ahora.
guys, am not ready for this🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope that CG is only 50% done because it looks awful. How is it that American Graphics teams can’t touch Japanese artists at 4x the budget.
Add mechagodzilla in the new movie
too long as a trailer... just .. too long...
🔥🔥
Amazing
Mini Kong needs huge CGI improvement I thought Warner Bros sold that from Adipurush! 😂
Thanos will be back 😂😂
Wait there is 2 godzilla?
It was epic 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Playback speed 0.25x at 0:30-0:31, Shimu and Godzilla going at it 😮
I’m so excited for this to come out🎉
It looks like it will make no sense at all... I'm in!
Shimuu??
definitely fixed godzilla's running nice
It's Shimon
LOL so they got the idea from Hobbs and Shaw .....
GOOSEBUMPS
There is something that was behind King Kong!!!? But WHO???
Hope they improve the VFX. Some of the shots in this trailer look iffy.
llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssssssss ggggggggggggggggggggggooooooooooooooooooooooo
Stop showing full movie in trailers
2:27 what i just saw “shimo”😮
This is a film straight out of idiocracy. Utterly stupid
This one is going to be a classic
1:48  shimu??
Kong rockin a power fist
Great Movie
Kong can actually have a face of surprise lol
FF 11 confirmed
There are two Goji’s?! @ :31
looks very stupid plotwise, but fun for the eyes
Why do I keep hearing the moist scream
The Killing it Every Time . Cant Wait For It, Really Excited.❤
The movie will turn out to be better than we thought, it's really good😳
This is cool and all, but man monster movies where supposed to be scary, thrilling and fear evoking,  but now all we get are superhero movies of giants.
In every kong/Godzilla movie :  "Something is coming, something big". They make these high budget films but never do these humongous beasts give the real impact of monstrosity. Godzilla Minus One nailed it with only $15 million. Pacific Rim 1 is a close second.
Kong ❤️‍🔥
Are we gonna call the little kong prince kong?
Bro can we please continue with Godzilla x Kong x Pacific Rim.
How many times have you watched it?
WTF  am i seeing 2 Godzillas  and another big bad Kong that is  awesome this movie is a must see
I was waiting for this trailer ❤️❤️
goosebumps
They put sprinkles on a premium steak. This could backfire real fast.
2:26 the way Kong just paralyze skar king💀
cool
I don't care if Big G and Kong got less screen time than the humans this is so God daym HYPE!
The amount of excitement I have after seeing this couldn't be contained.
GODZILLA N1
That's tooooo...... good bro. Godzilla using nuclear pulse in base
This cooler then I thought
This getting kinda exaggerated plus those human characters are rlly just filler and boring
edian cooook
why does godzilla should like moist critikal when he roars
bro they give whole movie plot in one trailer 😭
i am absolutely loving the monsterverse, this looks like some awesome destructive fun and i love how serious godzilla minus one looks
Kong got a power fist dope
Wont be as good as minus one, but we it could be good. The last few Godzilla movies done by Hollywood have been okay, good visuals, but not great movies
how about GODZILLA x KONG x TRANSFORMERS 😱
Was that space Godzilla?
Болею за Годзиллу, мне похуй.
Cannot believe they still didn't fully show Shimu
Ok
this looks stupid..
Avengers kong😂
Wait that looked like another mechagodzilla???
Whenever I watch this I feel it a comedy, these characters are made to act so seriously as if really any Kong or any Godzilla will ever understand humanity and fight to protect it. These kong or godzilla movies are joke.
Wtf human gone do?😮
Why is a giant gorilla monster making a face like this 😲
Goosebumps ❤
Anjir trending 😂
Marea video koi nahe daktha ha😢😢😢😢
It's been a while since anyone's made the world this nervous.
Monkey x lizzard cinema, peak cinema🔥🔥🔥
Who exactly are they fighting against….
Godzilla is a super dino he was black (plz don't take it out of context) then he was red and THEN HE BLUE AND THEN HE IS PINK AND NOW HE IS ALL BLUE he is thanos with all the chaos emeralds goku with all the balls
I want to see Shimu
Never thought I'd see a kaijuu buddy cop movie
Only a movie ago, these two were battling it out, know they are working together? How the tables have turned.
2:28 ScarKing's tooth broke out by Kong's punch 😂✊
YES,  YES! .....      HERE WE GO!!!!!
not sure why but I feel like this movie gonna have a lot roaring scenes!
I have seen shimo with the Godzilla,stop at 0:31 second you can see it near pink Godzilla 🎉
We have made some "MINOR" augmentations 👏
I should wanna see the full monster of 2nd Antagonist Shimo, and Reborn Mothra is back, I can't wait to see them in the new movie!!!  Godzilla and kong will be like: "Together again!"
Why Hollywood movies are so out of proportion and not grounded in reality
So who are kong and godzilla fighting against?
I like how if you can slow it down when they enter the hollow earth dude saying this is fun and gives him a heads up while Bernie said no this is bad 😂😂
looks bad
Is that Priyanka Chopra's voice in the beginning ??
Is the villain too weak or not revealed yet?
I think shimos first apiarance looks like godzila but in the middle of the movie he come into his full form
Epic, I cant wait
Kong x Godzilla - 2024  Tons of Goosebumps 🔥
Kong x Godzilla - 2024  Tons of Goosebumps 🔥
I’m going to be strictly honest for myself but I’m proud I rooted for Kong to begin with, not because of GVK, but I knew he will become better
This Movie Is Going To Be Cool👍🦖🦍🎥🍿!!!
If my eyes don't  deceive, the EMP blast GOATzilla pops has a Mothra visual added. Waifu is still with our God. Can't beat a good Kaiju Royal Rumble. Can't wait!
It will be amazing to see the teamwork of kong and Godzilla against shimu and skar king
Anybody see the part where kong took scar king's tooth with just a punch 😂😂😂
more junk movies i wasted my time watching this trailer
🔥
This is absolutely amazing!
Two billion loading
I CANT WAIT FOR THE MOVIE TO REALEASE!!
Godzilla x kong the new empire 2024
Epic 👌
... feel like I've just watched the movie
"They don't have to like each other, they just need to work together." gives cop buddies vibes.
🔥🔥🔥
So dumb.
So just to make sure is shimo in this trailer?  Because he doesn’t look that big but just looks like a blue icy Godzilla ?
🔥🔥🤙🏽🤙🏽
Why do have a feeling that Skar king is not as strong as both but have the best fighting skills
After watching Godzilla Minus One, looking forward to see Kong and Godzilla fight together on the BIG screen!
“All dreams have meaning”  My dreams:
This looks like so much fun. I can't believe Godzilla's Nuclear Pulse is back!
I truly enjoyed Godzilla one and two. I can’t watch this after they went to  the King Kong direction not for me. Godzilla minus one epic!
Wow
All I can say is…………………………………………..
King Kong ko's😮
It’s cool that the son of Kong kinda is in this too
I thought Wingard didn't like multiple trailers
Vibe like goku and vegeta 🔥🔥🔥🔥
SHIMO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My God is Amazing......😱
Btw guys if you go to a certain part in the trailer you can actually slow it down and see shimu
Toho gives us Minus One…Legendary gives us…this…
This looks ridiculous!   I love it
Shimu:monke what u doin here wheres godzila i wanna ki
2:27 LEFT HOOK
I think this is the best titan movie ever made🔥
Godzilla the king 👑 ⚡️
I'm confused godzilla go sonic  the hedgehog and became pink
Looks like pure dopamine 😮
Caesar vs Koba 😮
I honestly dont want to see a running godzilla. 😅
Amazing Trailer 😮🔥
how did godzilla get so much bigger then kong
titan shimu is coming also😮
2:31 THATS FROM THE COMICS
i'd still be way more jazzed if they were using old toho monsters
Hey Warner, please fix the sound mixing.
Well.. Kong got zeus's gauntlet (from god of war chain of Olympus)😂😂
I feel bad for the normal people
How much of the world's GDP is spent on repairing titan-related property damage?
READ THIS COMMENT 🔍"LIL RICH - SELF LOVE"  GUCCI NEW ARTIST!
Bluey Godzilla Form😂😂😂😂😂
Shimu💀
Shimo🌬❄
This comment is Edited
🥱🙄
SO KONG JUST GET TO SNAP HIS FINGER TO MAKE HIS ENEMY GOT ASH😂😂
Godzilla looks pissed in this one
I AM SO READY AND HYPED FOR THIS!!!!!!!L🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀😼😼😼😼
Omfg!!! They put godzilla and afraid in the same sentence☠️☠️☠️
😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂pogo channel be like,,... Welcome to the club!!, 😁😁
Inka alag hi chal raha hey😅
🦋 Mothra return...?
I think it's safe to say that studio has messed up big time.
I can't decide if this is going to be awesome or simply ridiculous...
I never thought I'd want to see a giant ape using one of those whip things with a spike on the end but it's made from a spine but now that I've seen it I can't stop thinking about how cool it is
I cannot wait to see Shimo.
So coooll
That looks tragically bad.
What I never understand is why is the destruction ALWAYS around iconic places or big population centers? The Earth is massive and somehow the destruction only occurs in the most populated of places. Yeah it's probably for added dramatic effects but if Kong is a "protector of humanity" why fight in a place full of humans that could easily get crushed
Trailer drums. Make it stop already ffs.
Well the bar just keeps falling
Super exciting
❤
Don’t tell me they become friends
Why am I hearing the "wtf boom" meme in this trailer??
Shimu at 0:31 😮
On 1:54 it's that shimo?
THERMO GODZILLA BLUE?
Every movie punch line be like, "something is coming".
This is the meaning of goosebumps ❤❤
Monkeh
Monke and super lizard vs superior monke
How many Godzilla movies?
Am I the only one who noticed that Godzilla and Kong are gonna destroy one of the Seven Ancient Wonders?
СЛАВА РОССИИ !!!!!!!! СЛАВА НАШЕЙ ПОБЕДЕ !!!!!!!!
Transformer 2.0 Another IP ruined by holywood once again.
2:43  bumblebee hand 😮😮😮
Looks great! Godzilla , kong and marvels is the only thing keeping my childhood alive. I love it thank y’all 🙏
I can hear charlies(penguinz0) iconic "Woooh!". or thats just me
well, this is going to be shite.
CGI just gets steadily worse on every movie.
This is sooo fckng awesome dude
Kong is king👑
Mothra   yyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssss
lock ness and bigfoot save the world ...nice work boyz
This gonaa be superhit i'm telling it today❤❤
We need Super man here to save us 😂
Its just getting ridiculous and stupider
I’m actually so hyped for this movie
WB always expose 75% of the story in trailers.
They really turned this franchise into Transformers/Pacific Rim 2. It sucks.
This has Pacific Rim Uprising vibes to it😂
I just hate the dark pink Godzilla light
2:32 Is this Shimu or Godzilla?
Continue making cinemas like this.
Very very stupid.
this is more n more stupid😂
1:41 0:12 1:53 2:47 2:19 2:26 2:31 2:10
Brooo i want to see now
RETURN TO MONKE
3d or 2d
godzilla is super saiyan now
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 ahhhhhhhhhhh
epic geek rap battles..... damn my childhood was very good😢😢😂😂❤❤
Something tells me this movie will have less of Kong and Godzilla, and more of parents having issues with their difficult and rebellious daughters.
This is no substance. Repeating again. Do they get bored? Look how the Japanese do the script. Hollywood thinks all the audiences do not want Hollywood to improve their performances.
The writing is atrocious, but this was a much better trailer. I'll see it, but not expecting anything other than million dollar cgi action figures fighting
hyped for this movie, cant wait until they release Destroyah or Gigan
This is coming out on my birthday!  Long live the monsterverse.
Daxshat
Captain America x winter Soldier 💀
Action packed🤯🤯 also Kong and Godzilla working together😱😱
I guess thats shimu
Godzilla & Kong vs Skar & Shimo would be an epic battle !! Eagerly Awaited.
Someone call Thanos
Infinity Gauntlet 😯
This is gonna be epic
0:31 if you pause at the right moment somewhere in there you can see scar king running toward a flying kong? Or flipping kong? Idk what that is but on the right you see a pink Godzilla figure and an ice thing that looks like Godzilla from the behind or something new.
I couldn't imagine being such a beautiful teacher, my hair stood up
1:51 i think its shimbu 😊
We all known Mothra is coming.....and shes gonna rez someone, and then they will go full unstoppable for 3-5minutes straight.
Finally shin godzilla
looks like a banger movie🔥🔥🔥
😂
From Godzilla Vs Kong to Godzilla x Kong 🗿🔥
This is going to be epic
2:13 SHIMO AGAIN
29 march is my birthday ❤❤🎉
they always be putting too much in these trailers man XD
So there are 2 Kongs of a different kind and 2 Godzilla (red and blue)?
Deadpool 3  A quiet place 3  And now this movie  2024 is starting to get exciting
maharashtra mei Godzilla launch mat krna
So ridiculous 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 wow so dope
I swear if that is space Godzilla I’m gonna flip out!
If you're really a fan of Godzilla you will see you'rethat around 90s,20s in G-movies..they already done the evolve colour of godzilla,the Magenta form..Millennium Godzilla..You can see for yourself...  And mostlikely,Godzilla is evolving to a form closer to Mecha Godzilla..The longer arm,longer legs,leaner body & weaponized tip of the tail and the colour of his energy are all bery close to Mecha characteristic...After his defeat in the last movie,he probably took his time to evolve into a better form.And during his evolve stage he absorb the hollow earth energy with his blue energy more powerful then the blue itself...
Can't wait
this looks like complete trash
Opening line “For centuries there was harmony.” Me “Then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.”
Kong got the Infinite gauntlet and Godzilla achieved the super Saiyan god, This gone be crazy yarrr ..😅 I'm waiting for this movie..😊
0:31 SHIMO
is this and the monarch's kong, godzilla different?
Goddamm
KONG
2 vs 2
Am I the only one who thinks it looks silly at best. It’s like a buddy cop film with Godzilla and Kong? Like all the emoting like they’re human is so silly….then the baby Kong…that’s there to strictly sell toys. Where are the directors and producers that brought us all that rad films from the 60 to the 90s. The 2000s have been a dud, so many remakes that don’t land. All to show silly VFX, and no actual plot. It’s just the same stupid garbage over and over and over. I can’t think of a recent movie that will become a classic. Just garbage to try to make a buck and sell merch. It’s sad tbh, seems like they don’t even try anymore.
This trailer is badass great job Amazing trailer
Dope AF ngl
Bruh how many long and gojira will we have ? Lmao make different monsters , this looks crazy do
WARNER BROS: GODZILLA x KONG RULE 34: LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF.
O....M......G......😮..........🙏🏻🇮🇳
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
The Japanese version of Godzilla last year had a great story and very good movie. Unfortunately this story line between Godzilla and King Kong looks horrible and catered towards kids with the big visuals but terrible story
2: 26 Shimu 😱
Next level movie 🎥🔥❤️
This is so stupid.....😂😂😂😂 omg...this is why japan should make godzilla movies not america. Pass.....
This series is becoming more and more like f and f series
This is freaking awesome 🔥🔥🔥
SHIMU!!!!
I CANT  WAIT, GOOO GODZILLA
they gave him a knuckle ? at least make it fire rockets or something.
Best trailer monster burs World history
They have no regards to economy.
Big monke and big lizard vs big orange lizard
Man, how cool!!! If you pause on 00:30, the Firefighters Central Quarter of Rio de Janeiro, where I work, appears on the top, more to the left, an orange construction due to the colonial roof.
Got goosebumps when I saw Godzilla
YEA BABY! LES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TRAILER 2 IS HYPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
we really dont need another kong and godzilla movie
❤😫🔥🔥🔥
Kong Have AMG78, Gojira have Super Saiyan Rose, Let them fight together👍
2:27 dam that was impressive And that was not even his B.E.A.S.T gauntlet
Amazing
pause at 0:30 and see the size of Shimu
It's almost here and it's gonna be epic
everything is okay but why is there two types of godzilla
New movie villains : Walmart kong & Walmart Godzilla.
Yay a nice of pure cgi.... Feel like I should just watch anime at this point
хрена себе зуб
I swear, Goji gets more glowy every time we see him. Also, Kong's got a Power Fist, nice.
Cool, waiting
Looks good, will watch in theatre. 😊
I’m down for this but Godzilla running is so dumb and out of character
2:27 shimo fr said “😒”
kong  can't stop this on his own says the gorilla
Why they are all fioooioiiking up with great films.man
Just watched the movie in 3 minutes lol
Ear Rape: The Trailer
Another one worth seeing in theaters. This is a childhood dream come true.
I'm So Hyped
00:31 shimu spotted
Kong accidently snaps :   Everything become dust
watch david zaslav can this movie the day of its release.
Say what you will, the producers going like "yeah lets just crank out more" with the franchise is literally what Michael Bay did with Transformers and people ridiculed him until he stopped. It's clear there's something here because its just great fun to watch. Sure they won't be great movies, but they'll be a great experience.
lord this looks terrible
2:49 - 2:52 They definitely shouldve left this part out of the trailer, imagine how hype it wouldve been in the cinemas🤦🏾‍♂️
Any one ...who thinks... The Team revealed Everything...🤔
Finally kong got his infinity gauntlet in the last fight.
Get ready for this ultimate battle 💪 Pure goosebumps ❤
Still no where near minus one 😢
i see mothra.. hoping shes back❤❤🦋🦋
looks and feel sh1te to be honest
Go**tha !! வேற மாறி இருக்குப்பா 😮
Bc bawal trailer hai bhai yrr
❤
Great, you showed the whole movie. But I’m still gonna go see it 😇
This looks so stupid and I cannot wait to see it
Godzilla eyes... Pulsar 220 headlight🤩
fantastic
Masterpiece movie ❤❤❤.hollywood movie always king .
Does this mean we are getting Fortnite skins?
That's fkn awesome
Is it an action film or comedy film 😂.
Still hiding the main protagonist
How many of you felt " last scene in trailer resembles of climax of Bahubali 2 The conclusion where Bahubali with the help of chains breaks Ballaladeva's Gada
I haven’t seen a single Godzilla vs Kong yet but I am planning to start soon
So.. Kong has an infinity gauntlet like Thanos and an Axe like Kratos? What is this, plot armour? 💀
But can we get a nuclear blast like the one in Minus One, pleaaaaase?
I think I saw the full movie😂😂😂
Yeah, I wont lie, I kinda squeeee'd when Kong and Zilla were running together. Looks like mindless fun. Im down.
This looks terrible and the bot comments and likes won’t convince me otherwise.
Looks silly, but thats why I LOVE IT. I genuinely cannot wait!
Idk why but i think it's not gonna be as good or at least just the same as kong v godzila
that's awesome 😎😎
🔥🔥
Godzilla is in the title, I go watch it. It's that simple.
Any Tamil Audience
Мне кажется , что это полнейшая ебанина
Team kong
🦍The King shall rise🦍🦍🦍
Godzilla minus one > any american godzilla/kong movie
Cinema time!!!!
Pretty sure Kong beats Skar in the first battle that's when Skar calls out Shimu.. Kong My Man 🔥💪🦍
😎
These MFS really gave kong the infinity gauntlet 💀💀💀💀
KongZilla all the way!
Did anyone notice that during kong and scar's fight kong's left hand is cut but he wears the gauntlet on the right hand
1:43 scar king whip thing got like a spike thing, in the “leaks” it was mentioned to be like a thing that could mentally control shimo
That's an Epic ride.. Perfect trailer
Looks pretty cool, but honestly, after watching Godzilla Minus One, this movie's not in the same league.  Will still be good though, I've no doubt of that.
1:54 minutes bro shimo's eyes literally give me goosebumps
2:08 Can’t waitttt
GodKongCU gonna be epic for the next 10 years
Bro uses a Spine as a Weapon thats Metal af
Thought Scar was bigger than that…..WTH
Come on Legendary Pictures, make Godzilla x Kong x Pacific Rim
These trailers man feels like I already watched the movie LOL
Layak
showa series revive is fire
A foresee Kong jumping a shark in this one 😕
Bro... EPIC CAN'T WAIT
Only mammutty can beat Godzilla and Kong....
Team godzilla and godzilla is the king of monster
Godzilla Minus One ftw.
2025 or 2024 march
Shimu must be god level strong
NOIOOOOOOOSSA HYPEI DEMAIS
I really want Gigan in the Monsterverse so badly but this looks epic, cannot wait to go see it in IMAX! Give us GIGAN next movie PLEASE!!!
Is Mothra back?
Godzilla? Afraid of Something? Now thats something that will be worth watching.
Epic 🔥
And both Mothra AND Rodan have been confirmed to be returning in this film as well.  So this movie is going to star no less than SIX Titans.  I am BEYOND hyped!!!!
1:54 best part.
1:56 breath of shimo
love wins
The last time they met was the end of kong Man that was cool
Que épico 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Damnnnnnnnnnnn son, THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!
Trailer is itself giving goosebumps...Then just wait for the movie it will cross all the records
I need Godzilla to perform a drop kick or flying with his atomic breath. Idgaf, make this as absurd as possible!!!
I am going to see the moive its goig to be epic!
Stop showing entire movie in trailers
Go get ‘em Godzilla! 🫡
So that scene at the end was Godzilla doing some sort of emp thing. Not Shimu right
Has anyone notice that kong is losing a fang
Feels like you spoiled the entire movie.
Awesome 🤩 i knew skar king is not only villain. Shimo also villain. I can't wait to see.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤
On minute 2:27 You can clearly see  shimo face
That weapon must be made of spine of a snake the one Kong fought.
SOLD on that power glove!!!!  I call "DIBS" on that
kong vs skar king. (durotan vs guldan reference from warcraft movie)
1:52 Shimu?
This is so peak!
OMG me and my boyfriend can’t wait. I love these two together.
Finally some shimo shots im trailer
Disclaimer: Some empty office buildings were destroyed during the shooting. Nobody was harmed, as people were working comfortably from home
Thanos be like why do have my infinity gauntlet 😂 Kong to Godzilla- bro change your backlit color bro 💓
I love it when Godzilla wreaks havoc 🤣🤣
😳😳😳😳 Just mesmerized
👌
The screenplay: "Boom! Crash! Pow! Clang! Grrrr... Roar! Zap. Pow! Zoinks! Kaboom!"
Wow that was insane broo 😮
Looks like they’re just doing to much
Who else thought it was Bumblebee in the first few seconds of the trailer?
Pllp who no dis finna be hella good movie   👇  👇 👇
anyone noticed shimo in trailer?
they over done it, just like the latest transformers
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁  годзилла был взрыв как 2019 я люблю годзилла 2014-2024 💙💙💙💙💙💙💜💜💜💜💜💜 2017-2024 конг 🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
Whyyyyy does this look so horrendously bad!!!!??? At this point every movie that comes out in this generation wants to compete to who can make the worst possible CGI 😵 I cant fathom the fact that this is a 2024 movie looool
Am I the only one that finds Godzilla and Kong running together both cringe yet cool at the same time?
Shimu ??
ok im glad to see that Godzilla is still bulky as usual, they toys that i saw at my local walmart had me extremely concern because it look absolutely weird been skinny.
shimu
Moral of the Story - Cameraman never dies.💪
Cant wait to watch a monster movie thats 99% human drama
SHIMU!!!!?????
СУКА КАК ЖЕ Я КАЙФАНУЛ ОТ ТРЕЙЛЕРА!
W
2:47 bro should be a scorpion not a gorilla
😅🤦🤦🤦
If Gadzuki shows up i'm out...
What if after Kong defeats Skar King, this makes Kong the other kong's leader, and he's then King Kong
Thats weird
Theri................. vera leval
is it just me or does it sound like a youtuber is screaming at each roar
Wtf is this dookie?
They really don’t know how to stop 🤣🤣
Whats the villain in this?
Can't wait to watch this movie.😮
Seems everyone missed the real villain of the movie.  An ice dragon.  Skar already getting whupped in a trailer,,, the downplay just made me NOT want to watch the movie.  At least in the last movie they hid the villain very well.  The only reason to watch the movie was the reveal.  I'm assuming they have the same tactic this go round.  But cats out of the bag due to shoddy promotion.
Nobody talkin about 2 godzillas in one frame
Графика борется с графикой ничего нового
Look amazing and at the same time its funny😂😂kong and godzilla already so big..now he have gauntlet.😂 next movie kong clash with transformers?😂😂hahah
So it’s basically planet of the apes…
Perfect perfect
i never thought godzilla will do his pulse in legendary movies :o
I’m glad they’re bringing back the dead actress, her and kings bond in the first movie was my favorite especially since the action sucked as*.
வேற மாறி வேற மாறி 🔥
This series is aging like a fine wine .
Hopefully kong will win this time ❤
That siren sounds like moistcritikal going 'wooooooooo'
Well finally human has a role
Does anyone else think that the sound effects of the glowing wall at 1:26 and Godzilla's roar at 2:33 sound... very weirdly close to MoistCritical's meme scream? The "WOOOOOOO yeah baby!"
Godzilla and Kong VS Scar King and Shimo ( Mothra and the spider titans will meet them soon )
Just wow 😲  It's going to be one of the best Warner Bros movie
It seems like Kong won against skar king and got jumped by him and shimu
SpaceGodzilla?
Omalaaaaa🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
cyborg kong? thats weird
This looks like CGI garbage. There's no sense of size or scale anymore, they are running and jumping like cartoon characters.
Bs
Bhaii sabbbb....🥵🥵🥵bhayankar...🤯🤯🤯🥶🥶🥶
So shimo def confirmed now ?
2:28 Now, I have seen everything... yes thats what WB's Trailer does....
Deaf people are so hot right now
I am excited for Godzilla ❤ but more to see shimo 😊
2:27 Kong: "Stay away from my BOY!!"
Can’t wait for the Corridor Crew to tear & break down the ugly VFX of this movie. And can’t wait for the actors to lie that there’s no CGI in it.
Can't wait to see this one ! Loved every Godzilla and Kong movies so far !
Another over the top CGI Bullpoop.
Kuch g phad aa raha he
This looks so dumb .. give me Godzilla minus one all day over this
PDIP X PKS VS NEO ORBA
This looks so dumb and silly. I love it. I'm glad we're back to dumb popcorn flicks that know they're absurd and just go full throttle.
its so Amazing movie ❤❤
Fans from tamilnadu are waiting for the movie🎉🎉🎉🎉
Thought this was fake but YOO I'm Pumped for this right here.❤‼️
GODZILLA 🔥&❄️ 😈
IT IS AMAZING
Honestly kind miffed the big bad to bring kong and Godzilla together is….. another monkey, like why? You have so many other things you could be using.
Khatarnaak ❤🤯🥵
kong did the falcon punch godzilla is now super saiyan blue and rose
Lol they look like toys. Leave it to WB to ruin a franchise
Yesss always happy when they make these
2:27 that punch damn bear decapitated scar king
Too many remakes
ONE PUNCH APE on his way to destroy BOROS from Epstein's island
2:47 Most badass part!
The BS meter is high on this one.
Excited but what happened to the dark vibe of Godzilla 2014?
Was that " Shimu "?
1:53 shimo
Super hyped
With kong and Godzilla together every movie will be awesome
존나 쩐다
Why nowadays CGI looks unrealistic 🙁 before 2019 CGI in movies was 🔥
Wait! So, Kong isn't the last of his kind? I know i just seen the trailer but bare with me.
Crazy how much better Godzilla minus one’s cgi looked.
😮😮😮😮
Is there two Godzilla s???
This looks so dumb, it might be fun.
graphics in early 2000s was amazing....present day cg is only okayish
I love Kong more than Godzilla but they're both cool. I hate Kong lost in GvK🤬
Goosebumps guaranteed❤❤🔥🔥
Is No one gonna talk about that cute Mini Kong?
I hate the cringe word "Kaiju" but I love these monster movies!😊👍🏻
How can Godzilla run/move so fast all of a sudden?
Godzilla has cute stubby little feet. That's not very intimidating.🤣
Godzilla had a personal grudge against those two bridges, he had to.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Whatttttt 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
looks kind of corny, b there first day
Jay shree Ram
This looks so bad
ye kya hai har baar chipkali aur bandar ko ladwa dete hai
Wtf did I just watch.
kind of sad to see the monster verse is basically just the MCU now.
Godzilla is being shockwave 😱
So nobody will talk about Shimo? coz Super Saiyan Rose Godzilla and infinity Kong kek.
This looks dumb. I wish they would make a monster movie without giving the humans so much dialogue and screen time.
Everything now bows down to Minus One. This thing looks ridiculous.
who tf gave kong a power fist bro this ain't fallout
Jabardasttttt
Kong Fist skar king face 👊😠
So, stupid oversized animals with strange gadgets fighting in sci-fi / urban environment = great movie concept
Im sorry but when they will notice we don’t care about humans in this movie
🔥💥🔥💥🔥🔥💥🔥💥🔥
So is there another Gojira?
Fast n Furious 11 looks interesting
Movies keep getting dumber every year!
BEST TRAILER EVER.
Why on earth are humans still trying to fight these things. 😂😂😂
After seeing Minus One, this version just…looks boring and trivial.  Minus One was just perfectly executed.
Everyone who had theories that ended up being right: 🕺🏻
The cgi looks so bad
Ok but Iam missing the older version use to be of this franchise movie.  Nowadays it sounds like Averagers movie.
The more they make these movies, the stupider they get. Can’t believe the first Godzilla movie of this verse was so great, and now we’ve come to this
FIRE 🔥
Kong got the infinity stones on that yellow hand device 😂😂😂😂
Bring back the godzilla horizontal tail slide
Shimo is here ❤
2 godzilla ?
Kong when three headed alien dragon appears: zzzzzz  Kong when monke: 😡😡😡😡
There was an idea, to bring together a group of remarkable creatures to see if they could become something more. So when we needed them they could fight the battles that we never could. 🦸 🦍 🦎 🦸‍♂️
Truthfully, I think the fights will be epic. But the movie will be meh
5.5m in 11 hours is crazy
Get rid of the human casts and we good
Yeah bro my boys is back on war
The fact this is #1 on trending
This is will be better than Godzilla: King Of The Monster, this is such a BANGER!❤
Americans are the Peter Gunn with these Godzilla movies.Japanese like “hey,it ain’t on us…at least Matthew Broderick isn’t in it…sayonara!
All these comments must be fake, cause no one thinks this movie is gonna be good
Feels like a lore i made up while playing with action figures when i was 7 years old
Anjjeeeerrrrrrrr
Man 0:31 looks awesome, Godzilla vs Shimu and Scar vs Kong in the city
Кадр где Годзилла с Конгом бегут😂😂😂
Hyped for SHIMU 🔥🔥🔥
please do not ruin this with nonsense, all we want is a good old  action and senseless destruction movie, please avoid the shallow bad jokes and trying to preach us, we have enough problem in our every day to have to bear nonsense, please WB do not ruin this...till now the trailer is ok.
wow so cool. A bunc of cgis pounding on the floor where their king is gonna face off against a godzila How do people even get entertained with this?!
that is not a trailer. that is a whole movie!!
This looks so stupid  I wouldn’t have it any other way
They needed to stop This series a long time ago!
looks so good definitely excited
KingKong got the infinity gauntlet  ♾️  Godzilla transform to super saiyan rose🌹🔥  And Scars got the chains like scorpion in mortal Kombat 🦂  Shimo can use Icebeam🥶
You can see kong's metal teeth 2:49
Kong mowa goppa😂😂
This is too Insane , the fights look absolutely brilliant
I like they are work GodzillaXKong GodzillaXKong 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro kong full on Will Smithing Scar king😂
Wait, did they just turn Kong into a Transformer?
Godzilla going through full saiyan transformation, first super Saiyan blue then super Saiyan rose. Gauntlet kong is preety badass too.
W
monsterverse doing a better job at it than marvel and dc rn lmao
🦾🦾🔥🔥🔥
Excellent 👌
Yo I’m hyped
I really want some Godzilla lore and Godzilla focused scenes. I'm hoping it isn't just two hours of Kong with Godzilla added as spice. I have no idea but I'm psyched!
2:05 the meme that we deserve
CGI Gorillas look like dogshite mate
Scar king has longer arms.
The trailer is awesome👌. But no more kaiju universe for us to play these kaiju with😢😢
King kong is biggest bhakt of Hanuman ji🚩🗿🕉️
This looks like absolute trash. How embarrassing that this is coming out after Godzilla Minus One
Ayooo mann this and Deadpool 3 and the wrestlemania are the only things gonna be a blockbuster this year
So pretty much Evil Kong from another dimension/world raises an army and then Sgt. Good Guy and Kong go visit him, loses his hand fighting evil Kong, so they build him an infinity gauntlet. All the while Evil Kong has a secret bad Godzilla to back him up and so Kong reflects his blue fire breath with a stick, and then probably they have a huge ending fight on earth at the end and the good guys win. That’s the movie folks. Oh yea, some dumb little girl has “feelings” too.
Жду с огромным нетерпением😮
"now i have seen everything" from the trailer -__-
kids seeing this gonna be crazy
43 days 🔥
Amazing
Bencho  Bawaal 🔥
I hope this movie is like 3 hours long
Sick!!!Nuff said
That punch 😅
I love that the Orange Villain is slender and Long handed... Very cool
I’m so Excited 🔥
These stories will keep on coming, until kong mates with Godzilla to create Thongzilla.
Wow kong equip with mechanical fist
Best Duo
Super killer trailar 😮
love kong is basically not refered as a titan but a great ape its honestly a nice little nod to kong never being a kaiju originally but more of his own thing
Moana 2 , Deadpool and Wolverine and this just a osome
All we need is a Kong Kopter
My valentine gift
Anda brutaaal
Is op trailer yaar first day first show❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
2:26  So Scar King is smaller than Kong. Not really an intimidating opponent lol
Oh I can't wait for this 🔥
500mill budget to bring only in 300mill trash movie
Menyala abangku 🔥
Plz come to Banglore = #KINGKONG.... so Many problums in....  democrays.. 😂😂😂😂😂
0:30 0:30 mothra
Monky lizard boom baam volume 2 🎉🎉🎉 I WANNTTTT ITTTTT!!
The mini Kong gorilla is super adorable
This movie is heavily coated in CGI idk hard to be excited like all the other ppl for a cgi movie it's just overkill at this point
lol robtop has more sub then Warner bros pictures and Minecraft
This looks stupid! It is for low IQ people who are easily entertained with lots of special effects imagery for the sake of itself. There I said it.
2:26 You can see shimu in the back
Shimu???? 😮😮
When it showed Godzilla walking ankle deep, then just swimming, I thought "wow" 🤣
The movie looks dumb
Whoa, can't wait!!
2:32 GOOSEBUMPS OVERLOADED!!! 🔥
Planet of the giant Apes. LOL
Both fighters are great amazing excellent 😳
Damn...the trailer show it all and I don't need to see it anymore
Amazing, Godzila vs Kingkong, ditunggu nih rilis Filmnya mantap, is the best movie
This looks amazing, i cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Huh
im hiped who else?
Only less people saw shimu on trailer on 0:31😮😮😮😮😮
I'm a simple man. I see a Godzilla/Kong trailer and I watch it
That. Was badass
wait so is there 2 godzillas
Planet of the Apes: Godzilla
They need to learn to take the sissy stuff out and go for godzilla minus one seriousness!
Director probably dont understand physics at all
King Kong collecting Infinity Stones?
0:31 we saw shimu and Godzilla fight😮😮😮😮
Kong vs scar king Godzilla vs shimu the ice Godzilla that caused the ice age
Movie loooks sickkkkkk
Iska ma ka maze hi maze
The whole trailer is epic
this trailer is so good 🎉
At this point humans needs to move to another planet, why they always still around like ants whet the fight happens lol
Finalllllyyyyy they shooooowweeeeddd shiiiiiimuuuuuuuu
#Teamkong
Dogshit
Shimuuuuuuu
I’m super excited for this
0:31 Godzilla fights simu
Silly Michael Bay'ed Hollywood'ed version with transformer Kong, electrified purple Godzilla, and a cute little ape sidekick - come on, we deserve better. Not every film has to be so over the top today. Did Godzilla Minus One not make an impression on anyone?
Ok, wtf they show the entire movie .... It's going to be bad
What a confusing trailer
looking forward
2:51 o dente de prata do kong, acredito q o soco q o kong deu foi bom, mas o dente q caiu foi do kong n do scarking
Hollywood can't show one "beast" being 'deleted' ---that wud hurt their "brand"
CGI & VFX is awful...
Let's go
For everyone wondering the flashback at 0:34, it’s basically a prophecy where Kong and godzilla fight Scar and Shimu and shows shimu’s ice breathe
New recorded film 😱😱 waiting me
Scar king fried watch
2:26 That has got to be the most devistating left hook I've ever seen
That girl be famous.
Super saiyan Jin Gudo 🤩
I’m confused is it 2v 1 or 2v2 scar king vs kong and zilla or zilla and kong against scar king and another zilla ????
Why do I keep hearing Cr1tikal screaming?
Take my money!!!
I really hoped that king Ghidorah would be the final boss😅
Can’t wait!!
My favourite movie ever ❤❤
This franchise is going the way of the Transformers series of movies, ever declining quality when it should be a lay up....
LETS GOOOOOOO
I've seen all their older movies n I'm still fkn hyped!
Killed itt🔥
how do i type
ho do i typr
Bro I thought Godzilla was going thermo for a second
Looks like Scar King has a Godzilla as a pet 💀
Real Goosebumps Guaranteed😮💥🥵💯
I see shimu 😮
Stop focusing on people keep the spotlight on Kong and Gozdilla they are the stars of the movie … that’s what people want to watch not people conflicts
Monsters putting aside their differences and working together kinda misses the point of...you know...being monsters
This is becoming the ultimate titan arena and I'm all in for it. Crazy trailer
"The four nations lived in harmony until..."
Yes, there is fine that your release date😊
Amazing trailer
Showed almost story 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
Freeza: DANCE FOR ME MONKEY🤣🤣
PHENOMENAL 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 The Monsterverse is very much alive!!!
An actual movie I’m excited for!
After Godzilla minus one, this movie looks disappointing
0:31 you can see how massive Skar King and Shimo over Godzilla and Kong
❤❤❤
Planet of the Apes???
This is so ridiculous, I love it
F YEAH 🤘
I’m sorry was that a fully atomic powered Godzilla?
3 Minutes Rollar Coaster 🎢
Finally the monkey version of King Kong
GODZILLA AND KONG FAN FROM MALAYSIA 🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾 WAITING 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Monkey brains, lizard brains, what could be more entertaining than that. Let's go
The new Empire is amazing congratulations
I don't wanna wait, I wanna watch it NOWWW 😢😢😢
Can't wait
Seems like this franchise has found its groove and isn’t slowing down.
Remember the Godzilla king of the monsters trailer? Playing Clair de lune? That was so beautiful, it’s unfortunate we have the boring generic action trailers now
When Godzilla gets overcharged and kong gets a prosthetic
Maje ultra plus
AY YO HOLDUP. There's two Godzillas??? 0:30 I'm sure I saw something.
ULTIMATE LEVEL 💥💥💥💥💥💥 TRAILER EARLY WAITING FOR GODZILLA X KONG NEW EMPIRE MOVIE 💥💥💥💥💥💥 BLAST THEATRES 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
As a team, this movie will be EPIC!!!!!
MONKE
Those who watch this movie in mobile phone they are definitely unlucky 😮😮
Thats call the movie
Siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ❤❤
I want it now
Godzilla 2014 was like this grounded gritty dramatic disaster film, just like Godzilla's debut in 1954. This is more of a fun monster mashup film and is more alike in spirit with the late showa 70s-80s Godzilla era. I love this progressions of the Monsterverse. I really hope the Monsterverse last a long time and expand its world beyond Godzilla and Kong.
A Masterpiece Loading 😊😊❤
Now this looks like a good movie.. take notes marvel and your woke bs.
Mann wtf is this smh
Hey Bob, GFY
Trailer tell us almost whole movie 😅
I’m just glad they aren’t making us wait till summer 🙌🏽
What is AEW hangman page doing here????😂😂😂
They 2fast 2furious this franchise.
😍❤️
Godzilla and Kong team up to save the world.
😐😐😐
Indian fans be like : gand fat Gaya ❤🎉
В 1:59 я понял что у этой Годзиллы есть ледяное дыхание ведь у Конга замёрзла рука и я не понимаю это новая сила Годзиллы или это просто другая Годзилла, как мне кажется будет не только враг красный Конг а ещë и враг и по хуже они вместе с новой невиданной силой титанов у Годзиллы прям из его тела видна его сила энергия кажется что у него энергии хватит на всю его жизнь он так долго впитал эту силу что она виднеется с его тела и я не знаю почему он розовый а иногда синий как мне кажется будет и враг Конг и враг Годзилла ведь я думаю что Годзилла не напал бы на Конга потому что он просто титан и я думаю что это другой Годзилла ну такая моя теория ну как мне кажется похожее
Freezing breath ???? I know you know ♡♡♡
Omg iska director Bhang pike movie bana raha hai kya g***d faad hai bhai 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Cthulu in the next one please
I am too excited!!!!
BROO!!
2:27 Kong:YEET
This new videogame looks pretty cool.
Monke and lizard fight red monke. Man happy
And dey say, and dey say, and dey say chivalry is dead! - DOOMKONG
Just me, or does the cgi look better in this trailer?
Kong should be bigger louder and have access to an infinity gauntlet
In the 90s it was wheel chair kids now it’s deaf kids?  Why shoehorn them into stuff?
Goosebumps bruh 😮 ….
🔥🔥🔥
Worst "Avengers assemble" moment since The Exorcist: Believer.  Why do these movies have to be so dumb? I'm so hesitant to ask why there's a pink Godzilla and a blue Godzilla.   They're putting this out in March, so I have to wonder why it's not a big summer release.
I thought they were only rumours that was a relief 😅
Wants to see shimo clear face  2:27 look behind them on the right
как же дешево это смотрится
I'm getting Michael Bay x MCU vibes from this
1:09 POV:our feelings
I’m excited for this movie it looks epic
Cant wait for the disaster....!
That was AMAZING 🤩
knocking Skar king tooth as Payback is best part of trailer 2:27
2:06 what's with the pink godzilla bruhh💀💀
skip the human part!!! i wanna see infinity kong!!!
Why hunan always stand their nose in everything
Bro this is crazy 🤯 really excited to watch this movie 🎥🍿
Kong got a thunder punch and godzilla got a thunder wave
So the little girl is Megumi Odaka now? And im seeing a bit of green in Godzilla's evolved form, much like the Millennium design. Also, Kong looks like he's gonna receive a HUGE beatdown before Godzilla gets there. Looks like it's not gonna be good, but be SUPER fun. I'm all in for a fun, no f*cks given Godzilla movie.
Enjoyable entertainment! Godzilla and Kong on screen the way they were meant to be seen! Perfection!!
0:30 u can literally see mothra in jia’s eyes 😅😅
Wow, after watching Godzilla Minus One, this just looks.. childish. Even the CGI looks like a step backward. Hard pass.
😍💥
Finally a movie worth going to the movie theater for.
Garda udd gya...😮 Trailer hi aisa h to movie kaisi hogi..😮
I can't decide if that earr*pe roar is creepy or hilarious! 😅
Jason and rock are back. Awesome
Pure Goosebumps.... 🔥🔥🔥
Post C19 movies are now going to be fun again.
Love watching my favorite Monke and Lizerd fight!
i dont think ive been hyped like this for a movie in a long time
BRO FINALLY THE TRAILER 2 CAME OUT. IM SO HAPPY THAT YOU GOT MORE :)
2:26 is u go 0.25 u can see shimu right of skarking before kong punched him
The kong is a gauntlet zeus
Bro wtf if this. What happened lol
WHAT ATRAILOR CUT.

america just ruins godzilla
This a big monkey
Ts looks retarded
Let me guess, Kong becomes king of the apes and finally gets called King Kong?
I don't know. The more I see of this film, the more it seems like a _major_ step backwards.
They've come a long ways since the hand puppets used in the  "60's films.
Whoaaa Dominick torredo and the fast furious crew flying in on those jets, teaming up with kong/zilla to take on the new threat!! Didnt expect that one. huge props to the film makers, its gon be epic!! The clip in the extended trailer with Vin diesel in the charger with the grappling hook on mecha-ghidora and The rock johnson teaching Kong fight moves!! With the robo-glove! Insane, I literally just shat myself with excitment, cant wait!!!
2:34 blue thermo nuclear :)😮
Madness 😮
they gonna jump the shark with this one
02:38 baby killed a monkey
But why does Godzilla and Kong running together look so cute, tho? 😂
Kong vs Kong Godzilla vs Godzilla

Have Anyone Noticed The New Villen With Scar King Who Is Actually Shimo AKA Ice Godzilla He Is Trying To Make Another Ice Age On Earth
Sera tan EPICAAA  esta pelicula ❤🥵😍🤤
It’s such a great time to be a Godzilla fan. We get to enjoy the serious and compelling Godzilla Minus One as well as the action-packed and Showa-esque Godzilla X Kong.
Harambe... how have you grown :'3
Hindi me trailer banao
A Dream come true like Film for a kid
I kinda like the the og godzilla and kong where it was some what grounded. Now we turning it to 11.
this looks so silly and i cant wait to see it
Kong Skull Island>>>>other Kong films
TRAILER KCPD  🔥🔥🔥
The ultimate battle of the Titans! Kong and Godzilla charging in together is pure excitement!
I love The Two Godzilla but I don’t know what will happen to the movie
teamkong ❤
Godzilla x Kong x Transformers ..next
2:33 showa godzilla 1974 can do that too with electric
😬
Poooodyy 🇧🇷
Not Rio!!!
HYPEE
Dang, deviljho looking more fire today
Passado , 2 Godzillas ??
The way they run👅
Number one on trending😂😂
Am I missing something? Kong vs Godzilla premise: godzilla feels the threatened by the presence of Ghidorah. Tries to warn the humans and Kong. In the confusion Kong and Zilla fight until the threat shows up. Threat beats up Zilla so Kong evens the playing field then they go their separate ways. Now Kong feels the presence of a threat and can’t defeat it alone so he needs the help of Zilla. Due to some confusion they fight again(after already teaming up previously) until they both acknowledge the threat then team up to defeat it. Running out of ideas I guess. New powers and equipment isn’t selling me on it
Yes yes and yes
Looks like another typical summer blockbuster.
March 20th
*Rocket* "ohh I want that arm"
Mind boggling
These movies just get more terrible with every installment.  I used to get pumped when a saw the trailers for Godzilla or King Of Monsters, but each disappointed more then the last.
can anybody tell me what made Kong have the "oh $hit oh $hit oh fu€king $HIT!!!" eyes?
all the world wants is monsters fighting eachother and this looks to deliver. let's go!
Next movie they will have kids called god king zilla
❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
When Kong said "It's konging time", I felt that.
I may be dumb but was that Space Godzilla or a variant of sorts with the Ice breathe?
Going to love their bromance
SUPER SAIYAN GODZILLA🎉  INFINITY GAUNTLET KING KONG ❤
I want to watch this movie！ it's cool
No shimo!
Team Godzilla ❤
Love how they embrace the Showa era goofiness.
too much cgi
@2:27 was satisfying
Less serious tone is what these movies needed
Shimu is there omg.
SHIMU 🎉
I’m hyped for this movie I just hope they don’t Give the humans too much screen time
This looks so dumb.. how did the CGI get worse ? 😂
Where is shemu
#teamgodzilla 🔥
Ticket book karrr lo❤❤❤❤
Yes
Eagerly waiting for this masterpiece 😊
I truly admire the effort that the fight scenes (cgi) are in clear sunny weather. That's a big plus for me.
Damn!!!!!!!
Godzilla running?  Yeah no.
That design on the Skar King is just begging to wear a Godzilla-like skull as a crown.
I'm ready for this movie! We got super saiyan godzilla and infinity kong ready to kick some a$$!
press 0 for camel rave
Goosebumps🔥🔥🔥
This looks fking stupid
I liked it when Homer was king Kong and just casually ate people
Damn ngl this trailer looks and sounds generic af. CGI looks pretty good though, but just like Godzilla vs Kong, I don't think Ima care for any of the human characters.
🔥🔥🔥
Why they are make Godzilla Head to small for his Big Body?
These are the kind of movies that will always get fans excited! Not the BS marvel has been doing.
Thanos and Goku in an alternate universe. 😂
Godzilla x Kong invites you to sit back, relax, crack open a beer, and wrap yourself in a big warm blanket of “durrrrrrrrr”.
They should get Jackie chan and chris talker voice them to add to the comedy
I got Attack on Titan vibes from the fight scenes
Minus One is better.
I feel godzilla vs kong trailer is better than this let's wait for the movie what's in it
We have Kong done get the Infinity gauntlet before GTA 6
Did any of you other homies hear the choir saying "Godzilla," & "Kong," at the end when they were showing the title card?
Thanks for showing us the entire movie in the trailer. It saved me from wasting my money at the cinema
Goosebumps Trailer
I saw this movie at a test screening and it is fire
The New Empire is amazing. Congratulations on the success of the film crew
Kong sporting the Infinity Gauntlet is something I never thought I'd see!
Godzilla is naturally strong this monkey needs weapons
Godzillla got super sayan 3
Race to the bottom like Disney with Marvel.
This looks terrible
I was searching Godzilla by Eminem
Never thought i would see Godzilla and Kong running side by side.
Godzilla have a new power 🥰
For the last time WE DONT CARE ABOUT THE FREAKIN HUMANS. STOP FOCUSING ON THE HUMANS!!!!! We see these movies for the damn monsters
Problem? Cant breach Godzillas scales with bullets or conventional explosives? I have an answer  1. Hydrogen bombs Even though Godzilla is capable of withstanding tons of pressure, radiation, and heat. It can’t withstand 100 Million degrees Celsius. Using the US’s 400 Kiloton, B61 Thermal Nuclear bomb, it can be deployed anywhere because it can be stored on Aircraft carriers and can be deployed on a F/A-18 Hornet or F-16 Fighting Falcon.  2. Depleted Uranium Rounds and Munitions  Depleted uranium rounds are typically used for piercing through enemy armor. For example its used in tank munitions to be able to pierce right through its heavy armor like paper. So by using high caliber, depleted uranium rounds we can administer a venom or poison inside the bullet to act like a needle. This will subdue him/kill him.  3. Salicylic Acid Also known as C7H6O3, Salicylic acid is used to dissolve keratin, and reptilian scales are typically made of keratin, so by dumping a ton of Salicylic acid on him it will weaken his scales and then we can use conventional weaponry on him.
Monke stronk
Can we stop putting kids as a plotline in these movies lol
what a very interesting big ape and lizard war film
What a Baaaaaaaad trailer i have no faith in this being good it looks ridiculous..... that being said still gonna see it 👍🏼
f***ing awesome 😭
Goji center gonna be analyzing a lot from this
So kong lost his stone axe and injured his right hand/arm
Why did they ruin the movie by showing the plot rn?
America is always messing up other peoples art, this is not "Godzilla", You could have put any 2 random titanic monsters together and made this, but this is not "Godzilla".
bruh
Yay
Godzilla's roaring sounds like a 10 year old screaming into his 15 dollar gaming headset
This gonna be dope
Why Zillaboy pink ?
Gusebomse ❤❤
Their world leaders & citizen must be bored seeing the town always turn into battle arena
Rise Together 🔥
Man the he won't be alone was a goosebumps moment
This movie looks terrible hahahahahah
LETS FVCKING GO!❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉 Shimo Godzilla?
after king ghidorah, i thought they would have been going with destoroyah. cause the nuke they exploded in that movie should have some consequences to it. i would like to see destoroyah at some point. i would like to watch this on see still
"...was almost the end of Kong." And the utter, complete end of Hong Kong. 😛
Monkeeeeee
OmG im  crying right now huhuhu can wait to watch this huhuhu
Wait, so there another evil Godzilla?
I love these types of movies.😊
Real cinema arive ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ baby🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Otha verithanam 🔥
Maza aane wala h iss bro to ❤
DC Executive meeting: Let's replace justice league with massive monsters! Godzilla = Superman Kong = Batman Mothra = Wonder Woman MUTOs = Joker & Harley Zero = Harvey Dent * 1.5
That punch 💀 2:27
2:26 awesome
Glad someone is making good old fashioned action movies! I miss these films!👍😎
Planet of the apes??
Who are Kong and Godzilla fighting against? Looks like 2 other monsters.
Yesssss almost a Day of My Birthdays 🎂 ❤🎉
O***tha superaaa
Oh yeah
soo they time travel and open up a portal for more evil creatures??
For centuries there was harmony.....then the Fire Nation attacked
This trailer was absolutely badass and epic.... 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The punch was personal 😂
This looks so bad.
Anybody can play tough (Gojira) when the plot is their invincibility. Others have to make hard choices and display heart in the face of death (kong).
Godzilla x Kong: the planet of the apes
The very best yet to come
we will be watching
the apes wouldnt protect humanity they'd be snacking
The trailet itself made me tearing up. So good!! Cant wait to watch
Another smash hit right here.
Goosebumps 💥
This is some of the dumbest garbage I’ve ever seen.
Chutiyapa
They gave Kong a power fist?
what even is this movie, this needs to be on rifftrax
🎊🤩🥳🎉Wow.  This is amazing.  I am looking forward to watch that movie in theaters.
This'll be more fun than a barrel of Kongs.
I love this tailer so much
red godzilla? pls explain if i miss anything
Now this is a planet of the apes movie I actually want to see.
bro anyone hair moist crital going WOOOOOOO- in this trailer ???
There's no Doug in second trailer 🥲
I hope Jet Jaguar shows up out of nowhere blasting his theme song at ear bleeding volume with no build up or teases.
no one;  me; u can literally see mothra in jia’s eyes 0:30
Dammm 😮😮😮😮😮
Even Kong looked surprised!😮
I love this tailer it’s fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
mierda de pelicula
2:43 "I love the Power Glove.  It's SO bad."
They still fighting?😆
You can see shimo at 2:25 if you pause perfectly at 0.25 speed
Goofy ahh
OHHHH BOY! This looks EPIC!!!
I’m sorry, but this is going down the road of fast and furious! Take something that was awesome and dilute it into nothingness🤦🏾‍♂️ Please stop while you’re ahead.😑
🔥🔥
I hope the movie is great. the trailer is awesome
The fact that Godzilla can run faster than Kong is terrifying!!
That is definitly Simu's frosh breath
LET'S GOOOO!!!!!!
Épicooooo
I salute to millions of people who gave up their lives so that this movie can be filmed in their city 😢.
Kong the grim reaper.
Godzilla is great but Kong is cringe af
I'm so hyped!!! 🐉⚔️🦍
I foresee them repainting hulk hands to Kong hands
What a wonderful time to be a fan 🤗
Not enough action and effects
Kong is a King but Zilla is God. One protects humans the other protects all of creation. Godzilla been around since the beginning of creation… Kong
Какая же это хуйня!!! посмотреть бы на целевую аудиторию этого шедевра)
Blasting 🔥🔥🔥
Shimu atomic breath was so strong
scar king really be changing career paths after getting knocked tf out by Kong.
I'm hyped. I'm not gonna lie, I didn't understand a single thing from this trailer. But maybe that's good thing.
I think its the best movie in the serie about legendary godz
Las actuaciones parecen buenas, el concepto es estúpido... No.
This movie gonna be EPIC.
So I'm guessing aliens considering there is big beam of light coming from the clouds
0:31 kong vs scarking & baby scarking, godzilla vs shimu ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Godzilla vs shimu and Kong vs skar king
Wow!
BRO GUYS DID U SAW SHIMU EYES IN THIS TRALIER(CAUSE I DID)
too much spoiler i think
pure goosebump.
I needed this!!!
You can already tell this movie is gonna be terrible.
ice godzilla :0
I'm as big a Godzilla-simp as can be, but this looks awful
There's going to be shimu😮
2:47, Damn!, I really hope is nobody in that building 😂
Shimu 🥶❄️🦎
Not saying that I'm disappointed with the antagonists of these films but, with how much Ghidorah set up - suggesting that there are Titans in space - kinda begs the question if Earth is ever going to be invaded by other space Titans like Megalon, Gigan, Space Godzilla and Keizer Ghidorah.
0:28 new Godzilla pulse?
so the red monkey isnt the endgame? good suspense team. kudos. now im excited.
This gives transformer's vibe. I like it. These movies won't feel connect, yet, I get a sense I won't be disappointed. I still think Godzilla King of the Monsters is the best one. Godzilla Final War and Godzilla 2000 will always be better than this.
👍🏻
This looks so stupid... in gonna watch it 20 times
Godzilla and kong the only titans who can sense things? Are the other titans dead or something?
Waiting
RIP for that one camel that fell down if someone noticed.
2:27
Just wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. ❤ no words to describe thats amazing trailer❤🎉
Oh,  yea.  Yet another loud, incoherent, CGI shitfest.  🙄
Obviously there are more then one godzilla and Kong oops!!!! 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
mind blowing
Extremely disappointed in what the monsterverse has become. What started as a mysterious, yet hyper-realistic take of Godzilla, Kong and other Kaiju/titans, has become a cartoonish world. The monsters do simply not feel real anymore in the latest installments🙁
How we went from Skull Island to this PS4 looking 💩fest is beyond me
Who is hyped for this one?
Love from India 🇮🇳
wait kong has a silver tooth 2:48
Godzilla got the Sonic Speed Simulator 4 star character aura.
Now this gives me clarity. Two Kongs, Two Godzillas and thousands of audience waiting to witness the mega battle.
Hilarious
If this is real life, idk how humans are not extinct yet 😂
You guys are late...carnation pink godzilla would have been perfect for valentine's day.
SHIMO
goosebumps🥶
This will never be as good as Toho Godzilla
Can't wait for this! I'm so hyped!
One thing I will like to point out though. Don't humanise Godzilla. He is the super powerful ultimate God of destruction who only cares for balance of nature. And we will love to see that way only.  Kong on the other hand, is cool , unique and emotional like humans. So we can relate.
Godzilla really the king tho
This is cool, but I'm hoping this opens the door for some classic monsters again. This feels a bit like another "Planet of the Apes"so close to the new one being released, I'm wanting some of the older monsters of the Toho Franchise back.
😶 NO WORDS
Kong is ozm 🙌
Minikong 😍
Why is there always a child with some connection to the creatures?
Why does Kong need any tech? This is King Kong!
Hollywood slowly becoming old telugu movies. I'm not saying it is wrong or bad.
Monke with power glove and pink nuked Lizard.   Kingdom of the apes.
Kong gets nano tech from Ironman’s daughter in next season and gets to shoot out laser beams 🤣
Whaaa? Blue energy beams - check, draining sand from around pyramids - check, weird giant horn sounds - check, huge construction machine parts - check, bizarre team ups - check, constant antagonist with predictably unpredictable behaviors from another realm - check, so this is another Transformers movie reboot? Do Godzilla and Kong merge together to form a bigger more awesome monster too?   The Japanese give the world Godzilla Minus One.   We answer by pooping this out.   yay
it was amazing and perfect❤
🔥🔥🔥
Godzilla gone to rock the cinima, team congratulations 🎉🎉🎉for the amazing trailor  Waiting for the release 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
King kong is doomfist from overwatch😂
Gonna be honest this trailer was miles better than the first one. Brought back the being hyped for a brawl to end all brawls
They’re doing too much now. Godzilla and skull island were the only good ones
Rise Together… Or Fall Alone…  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goku and Thanos vs Scorpion?
1.53  who was there with freezing power???
Love kong and zilla❤️
Amazing trailers
Where is the thumbs stupid button?
These movies are just fun.
1:47     What is that ?    A Human - Godzilla Hybrid ?     This movie is going to collect a lot of dollars...
The real  biggest blockbusters movie  hogi King kong super best hero jay hind jay Bharat 🇮🇳
Judging kong wearing that gauntlet something tells me his axe might be broken unable to use it
Finally Godzilla won
The little deaf girl is a titan.
is it me, or does Kong look like he's got some grey going on in his fur.
Can we please not have Godzilla be a side character in his own movie all I see in these trailers is Kong. Do what KOTM did and flesh out Godzilla as a character.
who is the enemy?
First sonic X shadow now this…
Op trailer❤
Masterpiece 🎉❤❤
It just me or what? I saw mikey tyson’s face on kong on the last punch
Wait did anyone notice that there is 2 godzillas at 31 seconds
Meow
This inspires me to watch Godzilla Minus One again.... And nothing else.
So... Pacific Rim 2 treatment huh? Anyone want to remind them how well that movie did?
Now we see the B.E.A.S.T gauntlet in action and king scar's whiplash,really cool
One of those movies more about a human than the actual monsters.
aint they just drop a godzilla movie last year
The dialogues are super dull and boring!!!
This looks so bad. Horrible.  Reminds me of the old king Kong part 2.  Awful
I can’t wait
Wow this looks dumb.
What are we doing here?
1:54 is that Godzilla or another kaiju?
O wow wow wow wow wow.....wowww
Just another level of goosebumps ❤
Hyped
@ 1:50… kong looks Terrified…never seen him look like that😔
0:31 if you pause on that frame its not godzilla making the energy wave.
I keep hearing Penguin0's scream during this trailer
Worst trailer
showed us the whole movie in the trailer
Оооо дааа какиже это круто выглядит надеюсь сценарий не подкачает
if they don't show the creatures fighting and just skip around to the people i will rage
2 Enemies? Blue Ice Godzilla and The Red Kong?
💀💯
X10 better than DCU and MCU now
Neat.
Is this real?
I'm a little worried about G, last time he was glowing he literally blew up and nearly took the earth with him.
2:08 ye godzilla aisa kyu bhag raha he bhai😂
I just love that these movies are basically just someone playing with their Godzilla and Kong toys put to film. It's excellent. I love these movies.
If Scar King Faced some of Gojira's toughest opponents like King Ghidorah he would've been wiped out in a second
No but seriously what is that at 1:54, is that the real enemy or is Skar King the big enemy?
0:30, x0.25, Jia's eye, MOTHRA THE QUEEN OF THE MONSTERS IS BACK
So happy to be a godzilla fan rn
I'm assuming theres another Godzilla, based on 1:52
I just realized, The monkey soldiers are smaller than kong.
Unban kaiju universe
Little known fact this is actually based on a true story. I once saw a chimpanzee fight a kimono dragon before becoming friends with it.
I don't want to watch this. I need Avengers vs Godzilla.
Kong is the Brock Lesnar of the Monsterverse.
we see this in chicago everyday day
Finally kong got some upgrades ❤️‍🔥🤌🏼 wow Godzilla bros shining😭❤️‍🔥
What about his daughter
It funny how poor the storyline was in previous movie but still, WE JUST WANT SEE THE MONSTER FIGHTING EACH OTHER… ROARRRRR!!! 😂
Hollywood is corny
Always Waiting for 😎Kong 😍
Scar King doesn't compare to Gojira s Nemesis King Ghidorah , Adam Wingard doesn't know a thing about Gojira for him it's just about getting cash fast a true fan would know Micheal Dougherty did a better job even though some people dislike the movie Godzilla King Of The Monsters 2019 film
I think Shimu is shooting the ice beam in the sky to summon Garraka to attack New York City in Ghostbusters : Frozen Empire.
True Godzilla is not afraid of anything! This is some parody😢
We got Kong with infinity gauntlet before gta 6
So boring
damn at first i thought it was transformers x godzilla and kong
I need that 3 headed dragon back
THIS IS HYPE!!!!!!
*Let's go SHIMU baby.*
Underwater shot of Godzilla's pink eyes was epic.
So basically it’s “Godzilla v King Kong”.
Ith 🔥thanne...
என்னையா காங்குகு fighter clouse எல்லாம் குடுக்கிறிங்க 😂
This looks like garbage. Mindless dumb entertainment with horrible CGI.
Dope
they are giving away everything on this trailer
0:31 GODZILLA FIGHTING WITH SHIMO!!!!!! Look in the upper right corner!! 0:30 And Mothra is here too!
The most epic battle is on the way
"For centuries there was.."  NO ONE CARES.  Shut up.  We just want to see gigantic monsters fight each other.  Jeez.
Bvs reference everywhere
Annoying humans are back! Imma go watch Godzilla Minus One
Thats dope
I can't be the only one hearing Charlie's (Moist Critical) iconic "Wooooooo" at 1:14
Curious date for a trailer
Please don't bring this movie in Ramadan Mubarak. Please advance its date
😮😮😮
the chick from the town... wtf happened to her hair?
Ok i am definetly so excited, they did a great job with godzilla, kong, skar king and Shimu/Shimo (all of those characters are so FREAKING GOOD)
This movie going to be a massive block buster
"something is coming. even they're afraid for" i can't wait to see it...............🔥🥶🦍
This will be bigger global war than kotm!!!
The Battle At The Pyramid Will Be A Bit Funny I Think 😂
This is fortnite
1:53 The Shimu.
That broken tooth 🦷 🤣🤣
Together godzila and Kong will be dominator
I was already hyped but this trailer was absolutely perfect! I can't WAIT to watch this with my son now!!
Anime Vibe approved
2:26😂😂
Pink dinosaur?? Really ??? and you guys troll Bollywood 😂 Irony
Please yaaar ramzaan me mat lao date aage kar do yaar please
look like thunder power
ain't nobody gonna talk about how kong has lost his left fang tooth at 1:49, and how at 2:49 kong has a metal teeth.
2:13 did you guys knew that shimu firing ice breath in the sky??
I dont know WTF I am Watching what they are making
02:04  GOOSEBUMPS 😍😍
1:27 IS THAT MOIST CRITICAL
Even they accept that kong almost died to godzilla, but kong fans wont accept it
Godzilla's breath seems like ice breath
Cant wait for them to adapt the Justice League vs Godzilla and Kong comics that are currently out
No offense but this is the REAL GOOSEBUMPS 🗿 i can feel it also... Not just kong & Godzilla
F**k they even made Kong a Cyborg!
Stop with the human bs. We just want to see them god damn monsters
Cant wait for this to come out
Mini Kong fans like here ❤
Would be neat if it was the Coyote vs Acme trailer instead
Let’s gooooooo
The actor who plays Godzilla is so dedicated, it feels like he must be jumping from one film set to another with how fast these movies with him are coming out. He LIVES for cinema!!
Godziĺla Be Like Thor In Love And Thunder and Kong Has Got Hulk Buster Arm From Iron Man
❤❤❤❤
Epic,
I like how they made Godzilla have the same ability as the Heisei era Godzilla where he can release a pulse.
Glad they didn’t show much more here, exited for when it comes out!
This looks so incredibly dumb, I love it
The way they made that lizard superior to Kong is DESPICABLE!!!
Kong punch out his tooth 😂😂😭
Where are the good R rated drama movies?? I’m tired of these childish movies getting released.
Was that a destroyah reference?
Probably will be entertaining but terrible at the  same time
No comments.
Es cine
OMG!!!😁
So Kong now has the Leviathan axe...
Oh, Millie Bobby Brown is not anymore part in this franchise. 😢 But I will still going to watch it. For Kong and Godzilla.
Just add a giant spaceman who shoots lazers out of its arms, and this franchise is complete
can't wait for Shimo's first appearance on the big screen!
Pure goosebumps ✨
this looks pretty stupid. there's no way they're gonna get a decent story out of this.
omg my babies
This movie Gonna be the one of the highest grossing movie in 2024.
This looks bad. Pink Godzilla. It was hard just to watch the trailer, no less the movie.
From the 1st movie till the latest one the storyline blows my mind..it developed very well. Who expect the 2 king fight together at last 👏
Can someone tell me, was that Godzilla or Shimo??? The blue guy??? I'm thinking it was Godzilla. And the only shot of Shimo is when he hits Kong.
Shouldn't have released on Ramadan sorry I am out
What if godziilla and scar in same team who fight against kong👀
Minus Zero is the better Godzilla movie
😮😮
THE REIGN OF MCU IS OVER! LONG LIVE THE MONSTERVERSE!!!!!
Yasssssss
now we see shimu
honestly it does bother me that they made godzilla more skinnier. My boy looks like he's sick or something :(
The direction these films have taken since the first one is....incredibly jarring. I'm done
Shimoooooooo
Godzilaaaaa legand
This is gonna be badass
I love the movie ❤❤❤
I am here for Fala Chen! 😃
ABSOLUTELY EPIC!!! 👏🏽👏🏽
This is litttttttt
lowkey thought kong was wearing boxing gloves in the thumbnail and wasnt sure if it was real or not
"Big monster hits big monster and that makes my brain do a happy"                                                                                                                          -The Critical Drinker probably.
I Can't wait for this movie to come out
Things you didn't see i'll show timestamps for you: you see mothra at 0:30  and you see shimo at 0:31
Everything has to be "Female Lead" and this looks like an Adult Cartoon for Kids! Generally speaking, Great job D.E.I by killing the entertainment industries!
⚡🔥🔥💞⚡⚡🥹🥹
I cannot believe Kong got is arm broke and got a infinity gauntlet and Godzilla had a new form I cannot wait for the movie!?!
Somehow the Monsterverse manages to innovate on a 38 film series.
I'm goin to be stoned AF for this.
Tight tight tight ... Yeah.... Blue, yellow, pink whatever man just keep bringing that.....😅
Love these movies so much
This trailer is amazing...😅
That bone whip is crazy, but I really want to know what has ice breath.
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire 2024 Trailer 2 is insane! 1:38 Kong With The Axe & Skar King With The Whipslash Will Be An interesting 1v1 Battle. 1:53 Could it Be That Kong's Axe Gets Destroyed By Shimo's Attack? 2:24 That Was a Good Hit. 2:42 This Right Here is Cool
when  shin godzila makes titan great again usa destroys the whole concept they are not animals they are humans he he
These movies are going Fast and Furious levels of ridiculous....  And I'm here for it!
This is the new Transformers at this point...rubbish..did the cg get worse? It's so fake looking
The stories are boring we all knew already that they're going to team up and fight against a common villain. Godzilla will get an update like every other movie and then the same destruction. These movies are just all bout punching each other and collapsing the buildings 😒.
Weird how the girl with the ring on her head looks quite similar to a Shobijin. Perhaps the Mothra egg in 2019 hatches?
Wonder how many smooth brains gonna think this is a sequal to Godzilla minus one.
മോനെ കൊങ്ങേ അടിച്ച് കൊല്ലട ആ പല്ലിയെ 🦍👊
The day after my birthday. 2 apes and a lizard LETS GO‼️‼️‼️‼️
Can't wait
Bro the gorillas CGI looks HORRIBLE. LOL. Especially after seeing the new Planet of the apes trailer.
What is the name of the Titan that freezes everything again?
First time I saw Godzilla in Berserk mode!
Bowser X Donkey Kong The New Mushroom Kingdom
Man, I'm still greedy for a Mothra teaming up with Kong movie(or a Rodan stand alone prequel)
MOTHRA?
Ugly cgi trash.
the only thing worse than godzilla running is him running side by side with kong like batman and robin.   oh i know. . . . how about a zilla-signal they could flash in the sky to call him
its 2024 and we still have a fascination with a gigantic gorilla. i love it
How many trailers are they uploading 😮😮😂
Wow Godzilla can use force bomb
it is 40% spoiled now
So you gunna spoil the secret villain before the movie is out…. That’s kind of bad.
ngl why  Rebecca Hall look so ugly in this or is it just me she is beautiful but for some reason looks so ugly in movie
That was a cool movie
ILYSM ❤️ Kong x Godzilla 🥲
I am thamilan and fan of godzilla and kong
So they somehow removed bumblebee's wrist and gave it to kong 🤔🤔
Big monkey and SSJR iguana vs Big Monkeys but orange
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Damn the cinematography for this actually looks amazing
these movies are so freaking stupid but i get drunk and love them
Wtf
So who’s the beast at 2:00? It’s not scar king
thanks for this trailer, feels like i just watched the whole movie.
🤦🏻‍♂️ Really???!!!
THIS IS SOOOOOOOO EPIC LET'S GOOOOOO!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE!!! :DDDDDDDD
Infinity Gauntlet on Kong with Super Saiyan Ultra Ego Power on Godzilla 😅😂
Looks amazing
The power rangers vibe of Godzilla and kong? 😮
Wowww pure I love IT ❤gd vs kk
Kong ♥️ Godzilla 👍
Omg, i will have to sit through this cgi disaster again for my kid, who loves it in betw
Amazing trailer I love it !  And now where is doug ?
When will it came out in tv? Or only in Netflix?
wooho0!!!
This is literally the dreams of many kids back then brought to life with everyone saying, 'This is how I imagined it.'
THE FIGHT SCENES ARE EPIC!!!
such badass, cmon march already
Rise together or Fall alone . Religions should understand in India especially these athetic Muslims 😢
Looks awful. 😢 but after Minus One, nothing America makes will compare.
Is that Shimo or just a different godzilla?
WoW Looking forward to it ..  and that last shot WoW !!
0:31 You can literally see Shimo duking it out with Godzilla over there.
They keep changing sizes with respect to each other . It's get confusing
Words can only begin to describe how I love the progress of The Monsterverse. From that Cloverfield feel the 2014 Godzilla movie had to returning to the roots of giant monster films. And that's on top of hoe the technology has advanced in these films as well. Its beautiful. Any lower life form that says this is bad as clearly never known about the Godzilla and giant monster franchises and foolishly limit their entertainment two things that could only be achievable in the real world that they live in
" They don't need to like each other. They just have to work together " what a great quote.
The baby Kong looks more like scar king  than King Kong
okay lets talk about the negative first, Its not about the urge that people have to look godzilla and kong interaction anymore because they did overdose of it and its more about the adrenaline only.  Positive probly the point mentioned above.
My heart is fulfilled Big Monke, and Gman badk at it again
Bro kong rocked that red monkey 2:27
Honestly, I'm disappointed. They could have made a movie with any kind of interesting kaiju, and all we get is a sh!tload of giant apes. Yawn
Can't wait for this to get shelves due to a tax write-off.
Nahhh, that Godzilla scream sound like " Uowooouh" Sounds effect
Man the shot of Kong and Godzilla running together is so DOPE.. CHILLS
Bruh why does it have to be always the Asian worshipping and the white people protecting them.  The white superiority complex.
ayo another godzilla or both are the same guy
This looks awesome
Rise Together Or Fall Alone
damn so that ice titan destroys the goji axe?
Scar the same size as kong? I thought he's taller
2:32 one of the most badass moments in these films. We see godzilla using his nuclear sphere of doom without the thermo form. too badass for most. I LOVE YOU WARNER BROTHERS AND LEGENDARY!
Kong and zilla made peace its weird
Lame
Damn, for a second i thought Kong had the infinity gauntlet
00:31 Pink Godzilla vs SHIMU
This is what we want. Please release this kind of movie every year..
Looks like a blast!
I think the series is not running the risk of being to goofy. This looks like more a fantasy movie than a sci-fi.
OMG...............
The trailer of titans shimu ❤❤😊😊
Extraordinary trailer I am waiting for the movie
🐒 vs 🦎
como to brazil
today is my board exam. I watch godzilla trailer 😂😂
GXK: There is harmony.  GVK: There was a war.   Monsterverse is making me dizzy with these punchlines. :)))
Wow
❤
BRO THIS IS SICK!!!!
Big monke smash things.... awesome.
2:05 godzilaa mad
@2:34 mothra 🥹🩵
When kong got scare of shimo entrance just like puss in boots  Kong is puss in boots  Shimu is death
😭🤢🤮
Just do the action scenes really good that’s all what a lot of us need.
Just two best friends doing there job wrecking things. And a little monkey too.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Godzilla correndo é para acabar.
This going world wide hit. You have my word💀
🔥🔥
the director is wise to make this movie because there are 2 fans in this movie, who are godzilla fans and who are kong fans
so who is the hidden monster that used atomic breath on kong?
HAHAHAHAHAHHA THEY THOUGHT WE WOULDNT NOTICE SHIMOOOOOOO AT :30sec
Thanks for showing the entire movie.
Kong is carrying the monster verse on his back. Get rid of him and goes back to where it was..just ok. That’s why he the main character like it or not.
Feel like I just watched the whole movie!!😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
FIREEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥
*From the studio that brought you KONG: Skull Island and GODZILLA*
🔥🔥🔥🔥
“I like tacos and  71’ Cabernet. my favorite color is magenta”.  Frank - valley girl 1983. - Godzilla 2024
They showed me too much 😭😭 This is going be to the movie of the year!
Thought for a moment they were going up against a giant lava monster avatar of the Earth's core
Goosebumps
THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING!!!
Many scenes of this is will be copied in TIGER/PATHAAN
Something Godzilla is afraid of?.... Strike one.  Godzilla glowing Pink for Some Reason... Strike Two.  Making Kong brass knuckles... Strike Three  After doing so well with King of the Monsters, they are rapidly flushing this franchise down the latrine.  Hard pass.
0:31
Niceee
Those higher pitched noises sound like Charlie screaming
This movie looks ridiculous in the best way
Team Godzilla💎❤️
Another movie worth streaming.
Tsunami is coming😍🔥
I'm calling it now! That's Titanosaurus with glowing red eyes!!
i love how ppl are instantly taking unofficial unoriginal memes they stole and asap commented it here 😂
I am waiting for this favourite monster 🎉
I can't believe they gave Kong a powerfist. I'll looking forward to seeing do damage.
This is gonna be epic
I can’t wait for march 29
king kong its my fav son
There’s three Godzilla’s?
🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Eyyy my favorite titan now is the ice dragon cause I like ice even though I get cold when I drink cold water but I like the ice dragon
hi will you please let kaiju universe get your dmca license so i can play ku
0:30 damn, Shimo V Godzilla, Kong V Skar
This is going to be fun❤❤❤
oH mY laNTa
Love the concept
My favorite part was right at the end when Kong yelled, “my web connects everything!”
take my money!
finaly godzilla can run 😂
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Only goosebumps 😮
At 1:51 I just notice Kong lost a tooth. If you look at his mouth closely on the top right side, he lost a fang. Looks to me Scar King did more damage to Kong during their first fight, you can tell his fang was replace with a metal fang if you slowed and pause it at 2:25. You can see something gray in his mouth, later at 2:27 when Kong punch Scar King it’s a way of saying payback.
dogshit garbage bullcrap
KONG GOT THE GIANT GAUNTLET OF BARBARIAN KING IN COC 😁😂
am i the only one who doesn't like this? and i like transformers (last one was meh) idk why this just doesn't hit it for me,werid :D
They gave Kong 'The Fist of Justice '😂😂😂
It's so exciting!THIS 2:07 scene 🔥
WE NEED KONG (reference to the previous movie trailers, this line was everywhere lol)
I like the part where Godzilla destroyed a pair of drones at 2:31  Godzilla should destroy drones more often
Hollywood will not rest until Adam Wingard ruins every piece of Japanese iconography known to Americans.
I wish it was available in 3D
I CANT WAIT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
These are just getting stupid.
God this maybe the most think tank ai public feedback marketing constructed film ever made
2:27
COOLEST. TRAILER. EVER. This is just pure awesomeness. Keep it up, Warner Bros.!
Finaly Titan shimu is arrival
2:27 how hard yeat bells hitting
So, King and Godzilla are co-parenting for the good of humanity😂
A baby Kong appears. We need a baby kong v baby Godzilla
can’t wait to see the big monkey and lizard dap each other up when they kill the bigger monkey
They definitely fighting space Godzilla
I always like to imagine what a full on cross over between The Monster Verse, the modern Planet of the Apes, and Bay's Transformers movies would be like.   Other than the visual spectacle  they all also have the same theme of "humanity is kinda really hecking terrible sometimes hey?"
GODZILLA IS BEST!!!
Godzilla have nuclear ability
It lacks something..... ouh I know ...Ultraman.....
Truly a new empire
Good lord those VFX look sketchy.
0....
Khatarnak bhai 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
The movie looks epic, but i think have shown too much in the trailer. hope im wrong
Did anybody notice shimo
Oh no...I'm not looking forward to Warzone event this year
wow
Zehar ....bro..... insane 😮😮😮
That red freak of an ape may have a wierd bone wip and some energy powers. but what he dosent have is two other monsters who hate him more than they hate each other.  so get ready because they are gonna wipe you from the face of the earth.
Now i can confirm my theory there are 2 GODZILLAs👹
bro godzilla has thermonuclear but in his normal
Is mothra return reborn please tell me I need know please guys
0:31 guys, we have a great view. U can clearly see 2v2
I’m confused. Who is the bad guy?
Why does the monsters screeches sound like moistcritikals cheer clip
*The Real Competitors of Godzilla vs Kong is the Fast and Furious Family*
IM EXCITED ASF
Super excited for this
Cant wait for GojiCenter to get ahold of this
I knew kong would spin back
beeg monke, large liz
This looks like the worst thing I have ever seen!
Why not give Kong a kaiju sized gun?
Trailer shows way too much. But i get it
CGI FEAST!!!
Idk godzilla minus one better  =))))))
After minus one... This looks like 💩💩💩
2:31 huh
Monster together STRONK
Wow this godzilla so nice i hope this godzila is the best movie of godzilla like minus one.
Kong 🦾godzilla 🫂 coming baybe...
Kong face when he saw shimo was like "Aint no way they got me squaring up with this big ahh ice breaker"
Awesome ♥️
Ommaaala poooduu...
Omg this gonna be an epic war
Long live the king.
i love monster movie even though its not real
2 godzillas?
GODZILLA WITH THERMO BLAST HUH
Looks like really cool special effects a great score but cheesy dialogue. I'll pass. 🥱
Damn Godzilla looks sick
WAIT, I GET IT NOW, Scar King was the ruler of the kongs, and they protected humanity, but Scar King became power-hungry and was the cause of the ice age, and since the titans were the gardians of nature they tried to stop him resulting in the GREAT KONG WAR then godzila defeated him and banished Scar King and now he is hungry for revenge...
Simply wow 🤩 ❤
If 2019 burning godzilla come in this movie which situation will be created........😈
2:03 Me: oh that's cool, they're chasing the enemy together  Godzilla: RUN MONKE RUN HE'S BEHIND US
Better off showing the whole movie 😂😂
Im exited for this movie!!!!
i love this
0:30 you can see the 4 monsters
My favourite Titan since my childhood ❤❤❤.....but that pink radiation is not suiting him....I think he should get  the super Saiyan sky and water 💙💙💙💙💙
The information about shimu can use frozen atomic breathe on the tog version is actually not fake
0:31 pause and you can see shimo vs godzilla and scar king vs kong
God this movie looks terrible
This looks so bad... get me a ticket.
0:33 Yess Shimu 🥶
La pregun ta para cuando seria el estrano
Why is godzilla beefing with everyone BLUE ATOMIC PULSE. ❤❤❤❤❤  RODANNNN
Did goji get thermo blue😅
You had me at "Skybeam"
this looks stupid, i can't believe they made it
00:29 if you slow it down and pause it while jia is opening her eye, you can see a golden mothra :) confirmed
This movie is stupid ! but for sure i'm going to watch it.
But where is mothra they say mothra will return in Godzilla x kong the new empire we love her and shimo is here
🤣😂🥲😐😮‍💨
New bad Kong looks kinda small.
#GodzillaxKong the new empire on theater's march 29 super cool @warnerbrospictures 🎉
OK BUT....Why does baby kong cgi look so bad?
As a kid watching godzilla in the 80s. Was always my favorite and glad he's back.
Mission :- Survive till release……
What I don’t get is why Godzilla turns at such a slow speed when firing at Kong
I can't wait!!!
Bukan sda begaduh ka dorang tu hari? mngasi rosak bandar saja 2 ekor haiwan ni 😂
Did Michael Bay direct this?
Diddy Kong 😂
Looks animated.
This is gonna be a blast in theatres🔥🔥
Godzilla is the only franchise I never get tired of.
Waaaah anjing 😮
Sin duda el mejor regalo ❤
Kong with Thanos'  glove😅
Godzila or kong fan like
Kong: In order to restore balance, I must eliminate the ape population by half.  Godzilla: You don’t know that!  Kong: I’m the only one who knows that!
this looks stupid - that writers stike is showing
Godzilla x Gorilla 😩
If you noticed, those blue eyes belonged to Shimo who attacked Kong and froze his ax
Now I call this a MONSTER Movie ❤
But when do Godzilla and Kong get together?😉
ALV M MENTE WEEEEEEEEEEy
MUITO TOP O TRAILER!
Shimu is here
DEMAIS ESSE TRAILER!!!
Incrível!!
Can not wait to watch Godzilla electric form like Thermo but munch more dangerous 😅😅
Chromatic aberration is going a little crazy in this one
So no Gigan or Megalon? That blows
Did anyone noticed the penguinz0 woo scream a few times? 😂
I like how we are slightly getting closer to more and more of the absurd sci-fi tech from early Godzilla flicks but they don't abuse it and make it seems useless by not carpet bombing and raking the titans with it in every single encounter. Makes it seem more plausible. Also because it's clear if suddenly a massive crab starts attacking Jakarta, you are not going to have all your anti-monster tech there in time.  Not to mention using any of that in a population center would cause a ton of death people so conventional suppression it is until there's barely anyone left there. That's when you pull out the big guns.
Nice! I don’t have to see it in theaters now
Beautiful trailer cut ❤Kudos to the editor
hooo shimu
Who's coming
Put ultraman in ong he’d be so  cool
Shimo 😮
Godzilla and Kong should not fight again.
Me want space godzilla ❤
Wow
Godzilla has King Kong on his bag. King Kong might want to call Caesar and his gang to help him out 😂😂
This looks like so much fun, I can't wait
This would have been so Hype back when I was 8.
All the Godzilla movies have been long and boring. I'm just gonna watch Minus One again.
00.31sec Godzilla vs shimo
Hahahaha
the secret titan USED A FREEZE RAY!!!! THEY ARE WHAT FROZE KING GIDORAH IN THE ICE!!!!!!
No offense but the CGI is like idk but this is very amazing 🤩
oh nah this man godzilla not only got his atomic breath but got a thermo pulse as well, this is finna be sick
The dialogue gonna be horrifically atrocious in this one as well?
I'm going ot need to be so high to see this!
when will movies like this stop.
Yeah, why not... LFG!!!11
Transformer Gauntlet and Super Saiyan Rose!  Here we go!
hahah dead girl
Its gonna be awesome man
ommaley vera lvl
wow ❤ this is real sci fi movie 🎉i love this
My god there’s always this trope of a little young girl who seems to have some psychic connection to the big monsters
First of all Godzilla is never afraid of anything. Maybe Destoroyah
Waiting for it alot
This movie gave me goosebumps 😮
Kong sees his people need a better leader then Skar.  Godzillabsees a true threat and Challamge in Shimu
Adam wingard needs to be kept away from these movies. This is just another Kong movie with Godzilla added in
now kong is becoming bumblebee now?
the graphics look early 2000's.  What couldve been epic....they cheaped out on the SX.
Can you guys do something for me please because someone died yesterday and I want Godzilla’s girlfriend back
This looks stupid! Kong has metal tips on his nails. Gtfoh!😅😅😅
GG BROOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!
Fx are so bad, it s looking cheeeeaaap
Something is bothering me... Gojira stepped into an ankle-deep, or shin-deep at best, water and then proceeds to take a deep dive. How???
I’m glad the cast of Rio aren’t around for this. Heaven knows Blu and Linda would be freaking out about the destruction of their home!
Godzilla showing Super Saiyan Blue and Rosé
these all are part of MONSTER-UNIVERSE, dont miss web series, the MONARCH : the legacy of monster,  which connects all part of Godzilla movie perfectly.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mini kong looks like mbappe
These moovies aren't for us adults. Its for thee kids that are inside us adults and that is why we love them
Fan From India
everything is big 🔥🔥
Why does all movies have to be filled with girls as main character, could we have some action movies with men who is not the Rock
HAHA SCAR KING GOT HIS TOOTH KNOCKED OUT LOL
This looks SICK
Generic human dialogues. Looking forward for kong to snap the monsterverse gauntlet
IS SHIMO IN IT
I love the monsterverse!!
Benzino playing Lil Kong is amazing
finally shimuuu
2:34 wait… did Godzilla just shoot out electricity? Bruh I love this movie so bad!!!
Ennada pannivechirke😅
Gommala 😤💥📈
0:31
Thank goodness I never got into this stuff....
2:07
Kong skywalker aka the chosen ape
Holy craip I can’t wait
🔥🔥
When Gia had those visions if you pause at the right time I think thats godzilla fighting Shimo if you look at the top right.
let's goooooo
Pink Godzilla? Can't believe that...😢
People believe that shimo came out in this trailer but it's not yet
0:31
#littlekong
this trailer Is incredible 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thankyou dare and trailer very very good ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dark universe: doa MCU: slump DCEU: rebooting Monsterverse:💪
Hi kong! i cut seafood on my channel
Let's GOOOOOO!
Looks dumb...I'm in.
The next month its almost HERE
After seeing Godzilla Minus One, this looks very bad.
Is that a Godzilla species spine Skar King is holding?
I’m hoping that Kong gets his electric powers  like he had back in the past. ⚡️
Godzilla be life even if don't like you I've got your back. Goku and vegeta stuff. Typical male traits.
This 💩 looks like cheeks
Why that baby monkey lookin like Franklin saint from snow fall 😮
Minus one es mejor 🗿🚬
It's bound to be a bad movie but we just wanna see big boys fighting and I'm all for it
Kong and Godzilla vs stay puff marshmallow man from ghostbusters
Wait... So basically what i might be seeing is... There's two Godzillas one that literally has ssjb2 or just ssjb and the other literally has ki blades at its elbows and is super Saiyan rose like whaaa
Tamil dubbed plz
The whole movie is in this trailer 🤌🏻😂
Kong gotta a Winter Soldier Arm now Thts Awesome 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Monstar ya cartoon 😂✌
As a origina goji fan, i know this one is soo goofy like the old days gojira mascot movies but at this point i really don't care about the story. I just want giant monsters fighting destroying things😅
Kong snaps" I am inapetable" .
I think the ice blast Kaiju was the one who froze King Gidorah
Can’t wait
Blasphemy! Godzilla is afraid of nothing
simply epic 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I already want March to come.
its gonna be legendary Fight Kong And Godzilla Even Scar
Seems going to be fun
Something is coming,Something they are afraid of too…
I hope the baby monkey survives! It’s too adorable
Guys this is is mcu rubbish reporting how can kong be a phase 2 type of character wrong approach
2:22 Hobbs and Shaw
I don't know about this, when they are not fighting in a city it looks like they are human sized, they move so fast and agile that all sense of scale is lost. The effects look good, but it feels off.
Good a thanos and super saiyan rose are fight against the ghost rider
I think Godzilla will get mind controlled and Kong will have to break him out of it
Noticed how there's not a single clip where Godzilla and Scar fought ???
👌
I LOVE IT CANT WAIT BUT I CAN WOOOOOOOOOOOO
1:43 Goji Center made a video last month about Skar King’s whip and Kong’s new arm brace, and I made a comment, theorizing that Skar King disarmed Kong by lassoing his axe out of his hand, before whipping his right arm so badly that it felt like it could snap off. It turns out we were both right.
This looks better than the Deadpoopoo 3 trailer.
OMG I LOVE IT SO MUCH SUCH GOOD EVERYTHING IM GOING TO SEE THIS ON OPEING NIGHT BTW CANT WAIT YALL R AWESOME AAAZAZZZ
Godzilla: Witness my new form. I shall call it…Super Saiyan Rosé Godzilla   Kong: You should’ve gone for the head
Godzilla vs favela
Stupid hoomans stop interfering
MV got the hesies pulse
godzillas sound like mercedes benz 7.0 BRABUS
Godzilla finna become a lover not a fighter with the other Godzilla
God ffs can 7/11 just stop talking for once!?
I just need Mothra back as the cherry on top plz! 🙏 🍒
I know Godzilla or kong one gonna fall in this movie 😢 & i love both of them
Mothra cameo please😢😢
Is it me or these movie CGIs are getting worse and worse….
Bad CGI
there's another godzilla? 2v2??? omggggg
THE HYYYYYYYYPE!
Go go Godzilla
I wonder if... instead of the pink and blue Godzilla being the same one....  Is that actually two different Godzillas?... That wide city split second shot at 31 secs... it looks like there are two Godzillas..
Why is Godzilla pink
Wow that's epic
I'm pretty sure that whip that the red ape is using is the spine of one of Godzilla's species!😱
I love monsterverse
lol so dumb...
Fkn Go Go Go Godzilla!!!!  Kong is cute n all, my mom is a huge fan, I always fancied Godzilla since a kid it's a no brainer got G-d in the name!!!
2 legendary tag team of the year  Kong and Godzilla and Deadpool and Wolverine
Yeh nah yeh bloody epic mate!!
OPTIMUS KONG!
CONFIRMED KONG can Clap Scar king . and Godzilla? his back with blue nuke... sheeeshh CANT WAIT!!!!
That looks incredibly stupid.................................TICKET SOLD!!!
No matter what happens, Godzilla will always be the undefeated, the immortal, the beast.
Godzilla ice(shimo) overpower
2:13 if you zoom in on the beach you can see Skar king down there!! 😮
The American Showa era is in full swing!
Kong when using gauntlet: i am inevitable
This looks like exactly what I expected. And also exactly what I want.
Why is Godzilla so cute hihihi
❤😂🎉😢😮😮😅😊
Breaking box office guaranteed who agrees
This is so cool 💥💥💥
i think that the girl is conncted to shemo
Kong punch scar king, so hard he actually lost a tooth 🦷 this movie is gonna be epic
gotta admit as much as badass this trailer was some these scenes wouldve cooked beign seen first time in theatre
Sooooooo who was the guy who could shoot ice? I forgot his name. Also a 2v2 is gonna go hard. They gonna be doing finishers on each other
0:36 literally what most of us has said at some point of our lives...
Big monke and giant radioactive lizard go brrrrr... huuu huu haa haa monke and lizard rise together
This is fake or real
semakin kesini semakin kesana
yes
Anything close to Godzilla Minus One will do. If you surpass it, I will watch this movie 3 times in the cinema
Why are they shooting godzilla and will godzilla have a fight scene with scar king
dope
you can see shimo if you pause at 0:30 on the top right
Yo hold on a sec 0:31 is that 3 Godzillas?????
Why’d the turn it into a marvel movie?
Pure goosebumps ❤
I miss one bgm
Eh . Now they’re over doing it
Kilakkkkk🎉
LET THEM FIGHT
Godzilla is my favourite monster
Finally Godzilla learn atomic explosion
Yes yes yes and again yes
There Is another Godzilla !?
We need the movie and the kaiju in KU we need all
Damn looks awesome
Not gonna lie I wasn't super hyped for this movie but this second trailer sold it
I don’t care what the story is. I’m just here to see two of my favorite big screen movie monsters team up to fight a greater threat.   Take my money!
Man I can't wait for this!!
Kong on that kratos timing
Niceee cant wait for Shimo 😮
Let's hope Kong and Godzilla are pro NATO.
The Fast and Furious saga of monster movies! Keep em coming!
Am I the only one who sees Grog and Kevdak in Kong and Skar King? If you know Critical Role and its TV series adaptation, you'll understand.
if you look closely at the scene Kong punches Scar King in 2:25, you can see Suko being choked by Scar King and why he looks so big.
this is everything about why the japanese "godzilla minus one" was drastically better than what we put out in the states.
Oh look, another trailer with BWWWAAAAAAHHHH and DUN DUN DUNDUNDUNDUNDUNDUN.  This actually makes me not want to see the movie.
So...they took inspiration from the blue gatorade neca godzilla 2019?
Just one word epic 🔥
why is godzilla barely in this
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!!! 🦖🦍🦧🦕
At this point, no one even remember the plot... Just hype seeing Titans fights!
Weird, that Pink form Godzilla had..is he going to be under the bad monkey's controll for a while? Hope not, it would be hella cool Kong and Goji vs Monkey Army
Tá porr menor!
Will Mothra our Queen return 😢?
Godzilla and Kong fight again
Kong got the infinity gauntlet and godzilla  😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉💯💯💯😈😈😈😈🔥🔥🔥👑👑👑👑👑👑⚪😱😱😱👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
So Kong loses use on his hand from the frost breath block? And then the frost thing happens in Rio. What does it come from? Godzilla is either pink or lightning themed in the trailer.
Prabhas
NOW THAT'S WE WANTEDDD NAILED IT
Looks epic. But the shot of Godzilla and Kong running together looks weird. Godzilla is gigantic, he should have more weight to his running.
❤
YALL HAVE LOST YOUR MIND IF YOU THINK THIS IS GOOD HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH
This is so stupid lol… gonna be awesome lol
Lousy villain...another big ape with a pointy whip???  Seriously? Yawn. Better be a surprise.
Google "1313 movies." I'm guessing they are in the same universe.
1 : 53 brooooooo shimu s here
No recuerdo la última vez que me emocioné así, seguramente fue cuando todavía era niño 🥹👌
SHIMO IS IN THE TRAILER NOW!??!??!!?
MELHOR FILME DA HISTORIA (ESSE E O COMENTARIOL BRASILEIRO Q VC ESTAVA PROCURANDO)
Can Godzilla and Kong take on the Autobots and Decpticons?
Epic❤
Rise of the Planet of Kongs.
Reminds me of a cross between  Time of the Apes and Future War. Can’t wait!!!!  😀👍
I am so hyped. I am sad I got to miss Godzilla vs Kong but know I get to see this. But this movie could have one major flaw. In the beginning the bad guys are incredibly powerful but at the end fight they are nerfed so so much. Em em em couldn’t be rise of the beasts hemhem hem.
That ice dragon is in the movie yesssssss
It's mean two godzilla
A tooth for a tooth
I know where I’m doing for my birthday!🎉
Seems like it is coming out earlier
I have a feeling this movie is going to be bad.
"get outta here with your cheap parlour tricks"
Keep em coming
Mmmm monkey
1:54 Shimo has been revealed for this trailer. I'm so excited for the movie.
This film will shake up the history of the Godzilla franchise
💥💥💥💥💥💥
When T-rex? Dig him out of ground and give him movie too...
Mad Mad , Totally Mad 😮❤
This looks awesome!
Kong and Godzilla as a buddy cop? count me in!!!!
They gunna send Godzilla an email can't too see how they contact him 🤣
¡ Wow !
Is it actually 2 v 1 or 2v 2
Miss the exposition man saying GOZILA
2:14 Geral se ferrou, vão tudo tomar bala agora.
There's only 1 protector of humanity. God.
mmood സാധനം
OMG in the scene kong touch  Gia  I think kong is in person and Gia came to help
Goose boos
This looks so dumb.
Wait 2 Godzillas ??
Kong will snap the f out of it.
1:53 Finally we saw Shimu's eyes. And his mouth to slightly appears. 1:57 Shimu's frostbite blast  2:13 Shimu has frozen the water,he is standing on it & he's shooting his frostbite blast towards sky.If we zoom little then we can see an orange colour structure which is nothing but Skar king. 2:19 The fight takes place again between Godzilla and Kong 2:33 I think Godzilla once again turned into his thermonuclear form but this time his thermonuclear form is in blue colour.And the blue flame is extremely hotter than yellow flame.So I think now this blue thermonuclear godzilla is too extremely hotter & stronger  han yellow thermonuclear godzilla.
Can’t wait to see 😊
Woowwww❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ waiting frm India kerala
Not enough sound effects though
Thank you for 12 subscriber 😢😢❤
at 0:30 you see two fights btw.
lol these movies are so bad but I can’t stop watching them
King kong with gauntlet? Wtf is this? What is next? Godzilla with jetpacks?
Pure Garbage, MV is ruined
Nicee 28 march
Heard this was based on a true story?
one of the best trailers that warner bros has ever made.
😮😮 let's gooooo
this looks like trash!!!
പല്ലി SIR 🛐🗿
Deadpool and GxK....what a time to he alive
Wait a minute i hear the voice of the loki actor
A sword for kong
Infinity gauntlet Kkng and Scarlett witch Godzilla vs Task Master and the dark Phoenix
LITERAL CHILLS
Might wanna buckle up because sh-ts about to get REAL
Stupid
I cant wait!!! Looks so good!!!!
Love the movies but whyy do they keeeeep changing the cast, it’s one company you’d think we’d see a couple stable in 2 movies let alone the series
Im So ready
0:29 if you slow mo at this part you can see godzilla and shimu
Can't believe that shimu/shimo is thermo nuclear godzilla but blue this gonna be epic shesssssssssss!
Is it just me, or does the boom at 2:32-2:34 sound exactly like the "WTF Boom" Meme sound effect.
Wow Godzilla had a pulse while he was blue
the plot reminds me of mashed potatoes
La trama aún no se entiende, pero se dan con todo
I like that monkey’s snappy dialogue. 👌🏼
Finally Godzilla get his atomic pulse now.
I know Kong isnt trying to step up to the G man again
So there is another godzilla? icezilla
Wow, this looks so stupid. Almost fell asleep during this trailer 🤣
Rotten Tomatoes: Godzilla x Kong -15 "a CGI mess" Captain Marvel part 3 +95 "fine entertainment"
2:13
I have always gloves this series, hopefully it delivers
Which is shimo? Pink or Blue
This franchise is reaching sharknado levels of absurdity
It feels like Godzila unlocked super saiyan rose ❤.....this will be legendary....can't wait
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Chicowaga spread the word
Bringing back supercharged Godzilla from the Heisei era is always a good idea dude legendary godzilla can now pulse
Can’t wait 😫
Yes sir
getting cringier than ever.
Kong teamup with minikong?
Holding out for the enemies to lovers fanfic this movie is going to generate.
epic
I’m very very very excited!
🔥🔥
*it's upgrated with strawberry flavor*
Can’t wait for the next movie where King Kong becomes a rock bender
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Alr here’s my theory guys you know Godzilla’s blue armor lookin appearance at 0:51 ? It might be a true one my theory is that shimo might of OR has possessed Godzilla and now controls him
0:31 godzilla vs shimo on right side 🥵🥵🥵🥶🥶🥶 Edit: now i also found kong and scar king at same time on left this scene would be awsome🎉 4 monsters at a time🎉🎉🎉
If you pause it you can kinda see kong fighting skar king and Godzilla fighting simu
I don't think Kong like to be second only on the billing.🙄🙄💫⚡✨
Yeeaah !! can't  wait to see them  do the fusion like vegeta and goku
they do be runnin
Rất hoàng tráng
This looks so stupid but also looks fun. Never thought I’d say something like that 😂
Dear F*CKING God this is gonna be amazing!
I've been a life long Godzilla fan and I really enjoyed the previous Monsterverse films, but... Am I crazy for thinking that this just doesn't look good?
We got work to do! Time to make a great stop motion recreation. 😄
Kinda lost me when you said Godzilla is scared of anything.
Im excited
Esto va estar con r34 🤫🧏‍♂️🤑
This movie looks amazing
💥💥💥💥
is no one talking about godzilas electric new power
KOTM was better ngl
🔥🤩
This looks great!
Wait, there are 2 Godzilla? ( blue and pink)
Kong sporting the Infinity Gauntlet is something I never thought I'd see! 🤯👌🏻
Make a live action Dragonball instead.
Shimo!!!!!!
How is no one talking about his new pulse similar to heisei’s😂
Gz x kk
I bet bucks that last clip was the ending🫠
If the trailer hits, movie sucks..
I liked the previous movies and the show too but this looks awful
If that scene with all the giant apes pounding the group has a cameo of George from Rampage I’ll will go freaking nuts!!
“I used the stones to destroy the stones — but the gauntlet works just fine.” 🦍 🦖
Thanos (Kong) and Black goku(Godzilla) in alternative universe
They told me the entire movie in a 3-minute trailer.
WE ARE SO BACK
so dumb... so awesome
Godzilla running like is throwing me off a bit, but I do like the idea of king Louie having he’s own reptile champion
Yooo, this trailer looks so much better than the first!!!! Super stoked to see this movie.
bro wtf is the moist critical roar in the background💀💀
I swear to god, if Kaiju Universe doesn't come back to Roblox, I'm gonna cry. I NEED to use Evolved Godzilla to decimate the map.
YO THIS LOOKS SICK BRUH😆
Looks like Hobbs and Shaw animal version 😂
I thought Eitri had stopped making gauntlet.😂
...Godzilla and Kong are gonna do some cool tag wrestling moves arent they? im in, you basterds
Why does this look almost like Pacific Rim Uprising?
FIRE 🔥 IT LOOKS SO GOOD
Rise of the Planet of the Kong.. With bumblebee Fist... and ultra pro max Godzilla... Wooooo✌🏼
Trash
this looks so bad. i hope they cut more of the human scenes to make this more enjoyable. i only want Brian to make jokes while Rebecca & Jia have a 60 second timer to get the exposition done.
Please stop making these meaningless slogs
what the trailer at 0.25 speed at the 30 second mark you can see shimo!!!! and godzilla and a big blast. the screen is for split second after Godzilla does a blast like king of the monster
Fell like we gonna get a mini rematch to satisfy some displeased fans
2:26 omg I didn’t notice this at first but when Kong is punching scar king you can see shimo staring at them
Me encantaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Was that shimo
Nah bro that Blow Kong gave to skater was insane
dude i thought this is transformer from the first shot
Kong Vs Skar + Pink(God)zilla Vs IceZilla(Shimo) at 0:31 for like 5 frames  So these movies are just like transformers and Fast & furious now?
Kong is back baby
This looks awful. The CGI looks terrible. Godzilla minus one looked much better than this and will have cost a fraction of the budget.
Gonna leave a comment here for history
YESS THIS IS GOATED
BIG G AND MUNKE TOGETHER AGAIN! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!
I was waiting for them to make a movie of Kong's race.
YES 🎉
Merinding cooookkk!!!! Better than Deadpool 🔥🔥🔥
Still highly interested but it's too colorful for a Kong and Godzilla movie. They should have kept it with a darker tone.  But I'm liking what I see in this movie, Kong, Godzilla and giant monster action!
@2:53 so Kong is Now CyborKong and is the same Size as Godzilla OG
WWE Wrestlemania World tag team championship match ? 😂🙌
It always b the humans tryna protect other humans who draw big azz monsters ina city to fight😂
Peak fiction has returned
"The Titans were the gurdians of nature. And the great apes became the protectors of humanity." Great concept. Love to see if the Kaiju of the Pacific Rim mess with them now.
Oh it's so cooool !!!
THIS LOOKS GOATED!?!?!
If you slow it down, and pause at 0:30, you got a wide shot of Kong v Scar King in the center, with Godzilla fighting Shimu off to the right. Looks like Shimu's even bigger than Godzilla.
Damn does the cgi ever look terrible and fake. That’s too bad it would have been a good movie I bet
This looks SICK!!!!! 👍👍👍
Shut up and take my money already
Dude this is awesome 😮
This looks fun and all, but after watching Godzilla minus one I kind of feel less excited about this movie
I can’t freaking wait for this movie! It looks like crazy fun!
so they just give away full movies in trailers now? what tf. ruined a bunch of spoilers lol wtf
Winton is back
0:30  shimu confirmed 🤍
Frick yes
TERMONUCLEAR BLUE??
I think Kong should get bigger axe! 🪓
Why I Feel Like I Just Watched The Whole Movie
Yo really not gon mention the left hand Kong gave scar king huh???
Which Kaiju will it be that they have to fight? That is the real question.   Any Ideas?
What a trailer man Really excited for it❤❤❤
Next movie they will get married and we will have a godkong baby.
Bruh I’ve seen so many Godzilla meat riders trying to predict this movie I swear I’m not even hyped for this movie anymore 👎
I got chills 🎉
I'm starting to feel like they're adding too many real scenes to these CGI cartoons.
I’m excited to see Kong fight against another one of his ape species.
CG so cartoony, but, bromance of the century 😭💕
Man im tryna see Gigan or destroyah in these new movies
godzilla got kaioken
this looks amazing we have gone full heisei here.  I can't wait for a solo godzilla movie however
This is straight out of someone’s fan fiction and they are cooking!
0:29, if you pause it right when the eye shows up, you can see mothras reflection.
Fights that should be in the movie 1. Kong Vs Scar King (Then shimu shows up and he flees) 2. Godzilla Vs Kong (Kong tries to convince godzilla to help him) 3: Kong vs Scar King Rematch 4. Godzilla Vs Shimu
I’m now seeing why scar king is a serous threat now.
Thanks for making a three minute mini version of the film and ruining it!
Did anyone ask for this movie?
wtfffff mind blowing......... epic!
man scar king really needs to eat 💀 has a severe case of har anemia😭
Better hope Destroyah never introduced that Gauntlet or Zilla cant help when he comes 😂
cool that Legendary!Godzilla can use his nuclear pulse at normal strength now
I’m giddy like a schoolboy and I don’t even care 😁 I LOVE GODZILLA!!!!!!!!!
Imagine Kong dying in this film...
THIS LOOKS SO BAD. Minus-1 is already better.
Gooooooooooooood
ANOTHER GODZILLA
Lizard's brain is tiny and doesn't have any intelligence by the way.. It won't fight for justice, it just want food 😅
สุดยอด
Can Rodan help or any of the other Titans that weren’t showing in KOTM?
Kong got his own version of the infinity gauntlet & stormbrecker😮
I just came on myself at that ending
Finally some clips with Shimo! I'm excited
how does it visually get worse every movie i stg
1000000% going to the movies
Godzilla movies NEVER disappoint!!!
I don’t like Godzilla running like faster flash it’s so weird
Looks like godzilla used a pulse
was that Godzilla and Kong training?😂
I love these new trailers going be 🔥 got to see these movies can wait and excitement.
Hope they dont base that kid around the film too much.. Other than that looks good
Where's Titanus Doug?
Letsssss goooo
Godzilla running swinging arms like a human looks so weird 😂😂😂
I just hope that Titanus  behemoth from king of the monsters will be in this one because they were in Rio de Janeiro Brazil. I think that’s where behemoth lives.
I’m excited to see Kong and mini Kong form a relationship like a father and son.
This series is heavily underrated. As is Pacific Rim
no wayyyyy, kong doing the "oh my god" "what is that" looking😅😅😅😅😅   1:52"
I don't know much about skar king, there seem to be another threat or the looming possibility that signal is off planet something else will announce itself.
I’m gonna bet that scene of them roaring at the end of the trailer is them letting out celebratory war cries after they beat Scar King and Shimo
ngl thought is reveng of the fallen at the start
2:33 sound like moist critikal haha
Everything a guy could possibly want
0:29 there are 2 godzilla
I felt like I was watching the trailer for a buddy cop movie (in a good way) when I saw Godzilla and Kong starting to run from that explosion or whatever it was. I hope this movie and Dune part 2 don't affect each other's box office draws too much (both come out in March, albeit 4 weeks apart) I really want both franchises to keep doing well.
godzilla x kong x transformer : multiverse in the dark earth
1:57 , 2:26 shimu is confirmed 👌
Proceeds to create a seperate series on the grounded take of 2014 since they've decided to go the Marvel route:
2:26 bro skar king is being wrecked by Kong he is definitely not the big threat
Godzilla took that jug jug 😋
Soon Kong will have full body suit like the latest transformer movie 😂
I don't think her hair was short or woke enough they should have shaved it bald 😀
Aint no way yall mocaped godzilla sprinting🤣🤣😅
Why Kong faster getting old than the little girl?😂
❤❤
I NUTTED. That is all
is that two Godzilla???
Can't belive Kong hand Is broken that's why is he wearing the metal thing on   his arm 😢
2:27
They gave Kong brass knuckles can’t wait 😂😂😂
I am so hyped for this movie!!!
Thanks for saving me 30 Bucks Warner Bros!
Godzilla worked on his speed 😭He was in gear 6 with that dash
Holy ... Mother of Titans.
I was hoping for more Shimo, but for him only to have 76 frames of screen time in this trailer. However, I'm starting to have just a little more faith in this film.
More Kong lore LETS GOOOOOO
This is by far better than Minus One (my opinion)
I'm really excited to see Dan Stevens in this movie, love his acting in the Legion (X-Men) TV show
Daaaamn thats cooool
It's worth the wait.
I genuinely have not been excited to see a movie in a long time! This is going to freaking rock!
See the difference is the same as Iron Man v Captain America:  C. America needed 'help' to come at par with Iron Man. It was a 2v1.   Same with Kong, he needs help. Either using Godzilla fin for a weapon or Humans helping him.   Pretty pathetic of Kong fans I'd say.
Um. Can Shimo fly was it in the water?
Pure goosebumps when Godzilla comes 😮❤
Ruby, Gilman: There’s an attack coming! Nimona: a threat so great that we’ve never faced before! Gamera: We need to work together to stop this threat! Captain Planet: I can feel the planet shaking! Freakazoid: So who are we fighting this time? FireBreather(Ducan): Threat so great that we need to work together to stop it! Ginormica:We Godzilla and King  Kong!!! Sora(Kingdom Hearts): Yeah, they didn’t like working together the last time they showed up! Pit(Kid icarus Uprising): They almost tear each other apart! Link(Legend of Zelda):Hyaaah! Hiccup: Then we have to get them to work together! Jack Frost(Dreamwork Rise of the Guardians): Only together we can stop this threat! Gamera:So Will you to work together? Godzilla:Fine  King Kong:Sure! Ruby Gillman: You guys don’t have to like each other! Nimona: You just gotta work together!
0:33 Shimo? OMG I Love Godzilla x Kong Wowww
Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This gonna be epic.
2:33 was that f***ing Charlie's WOOOO?!
So King Kong finna fight the orange dude and Godzilla finna fight ice zilla
I don’t know if I have grown too old now, but Godzilla and King Kong Turning into a transformers movie is not it…
So there is 2 villains
Thanks for ruining two classic monsters
are they hinting at 2 Godzilla's around 2mins and 2,15mins
They just keep getting dumber, Is someone at Warner trying to tank the company?
Oh no😂😂 these movies should have stopped after Kong and Godzilla😂😂🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Kong is really gonna be thanos imao
Why can't they just show us Shimu
NO WAYYYY
Respect ✅😁❤
Why tf does hollywood always have to put a black dude or someone thats not white as the comedic side piece, and it's always the white person that's gets to be the protagonist
Rampage
So kong right arms got frostbite by shimo no wonder he need a little bit of juice 🫡🫡🫡
Really hard to f***k up this... So lets hope they dont pull a bs on this one
This looks like the worst Godzilla movie of all time. wtf is this
SHIMO 😳😳😳😳
🔥
Wow this looks gayer than a bag of dicks
A TRAILER SHOULD NOT  BE LONGER THAN 3 MINS 😔😔😔
whoa this looks amazing!!!
Esto va ser épico 🔥😱
You can tell the end battle has been won by Godzilla AND Kong, that are standing side by side roaring in victory in the sands of Egypt, where the last battle took place, scar king is dead and shimo has retreated for now....spoiler free comment.
Why do they always choose the worst actors to go with these big budget monster movies
Anyone getting some space godzilla vibes??😅
The movie looks to have very bad cinematography and framing. By settling the frame top looking down, or far wide shot, it makes everything appear small, miniatures, unbelievable. It makes the scale of kong and Godzilla look wrong. Like when they are running, there is no proper weight.Instead of towering behemoths its like gorillas fighting. I blame it on the director for not providing better direction.
Rio de Janeiro , Brazil
Every minute of this movie is going to be gloriously ridiculous.  I can't wait.
This will be epic battle against King Scar.I can't wait to see this fight Kong vs Scar😊
Godzilla just exploding radiation is epic
gyatt
1:44  there is sharp knife at the end of the wipe
I’m glad they’re exploring the human side that was briefly spotlighted in Skull Island.
I cant believe kong and godzilla have their own wario and waluigi
Lets go
Bro Godzilla and kong carrying the movie scene 💀mfs destroy a whole city then come back for yet another collab
As long  as the stranger things girl isnt in it with  a dude who listens to kids like they are the same age 😅 very pedo vibe
Yes finally a real movie worth paying to see
Ironman gauntlet
WOW 😲 Looks amazing 🎉
This boutta get lit 🔥
Anyone else noticed Scar king ripped off Kong's fingers using that whiplash ?
Kong finally paid for that DLC glove!
Average watcher: This is ridiculous! Godzilla was never this wacky or had dumb action.  Showa era fans: 👏👏👏👏👏
This boutta get lit 🔥
It's weird how another Kong type monster is a bigger threat than Ghidorah, I know there's another one but nothing will ever top the fact that Ghidorah has nearly taken over the world.
MENYALA ABANGKU 🔥🔥🔥
The fug is that an Infinity Gauntlet?
Ong
This is going to be epic
take  my money now and give me the ticket
I am lowkey impressed with the new Godzilla vs Kong new empire trailer looks very detailed  1:43 that how Kong injured is arm
Hey look it's fritz Jaeger
The series became a joke lmao
Did they go too far, does george come out curious??
This looks good
I can't wait to see this and review it on my channel.  Godzilla vs Kong was the only movie i got to see during covid and it knew exactly what it was  The plot maybe simple but c'mon Zilla and Kong teaming up appeals to every little boy with action figures   I'll see this in Imax with my son and nephew and I know we're going to have a great time
0:31 aerial view of shimo
I know that Kong and Godzilla about to have a good nap for other 10 years 😂
This honestly looks so BADASS!👍
1:18 Now... hear my out... this is a theory I have that might be true... the mini Kong and villian Kong look like the same type of apes.  IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE VILLIAN KONG IS THE FATHER OF THE MINI KONG!?
cringe
GODZILLA VS SHIMU  KONG VS SCAR   ❤❤❤❤❤
KONG BOWS TO NO ONE
This one will be good.
This trailer goes hard ngl🔥🔥🔥
Bro Godzilla will do pieces of scar king and shimo if he is there
I'm so excited for it to come out
I seriously feel like I’m the only one who gets more and more disappointed with this movie series. 2014 Godzilla was amazing, everything else which has followed has been mediocre at best
Wow!
just a creature movie, i love creatures
Looks awesome!!!
kong and godzilla becoming best friends ever
This Badass Trailer is so 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
godzilla x kong is giving me DESTROY ALL MONSTERS mix  with FINAL WARS vibes. i'm excited for this movie.
This is terrible haha. Where to start? The mini Kong looks awfull. The plot makes no sense.
im sorry but godzilla's pink spikes look too much like plastic
Uma Batalha de titãs no Rio de Janeiro , essa batalha a Ivete Sangalo não vai conseguir macetar kkkj
OML I CANT WAIT THIS IS EPIC
With kong i can understand but Godzilla following the same universe of Godzilla 2014 is too athletic like on steroids or something. From slow moving to a fast runner with that small pair of legs
Hmm, this trailer makes it look quite a bit better then the teasers were hinting at, curious 🤔 hopefully these two both survive it, lot more potential and fights to come
This looks so stupid...
The fact how there's scenes where the G man is pink and where he's blue could indicate something important...
I just saw Titus shimmer
We getting KING Kong finally
wow cool
it's shimu?
Will Godzilla do his drop kick on this one
Ffs a mechanical gaunlet, how original.
WB flexing unlimited budget is unstoppable
This is so mindless crazy, doenst make any sense just plain cgi monsters out for ypur money. Im sold
y'all didn't realize that its been 10 years since 2014 came out right?
What they’re doing with the monster verse needs to be applauded far cry from 98 Godzilla
What a punch from kong
Top
So how many cities have been destroyed so far?
1:25 and 2:30 why it sounds like the meme of Penguinz0  screaming ''Woooo yeah Baby!''
Where is the seismograph sound effect from trailer 1?👀 That was lit in the first trailer
0:58 I doubt Godzilla is afraid of a skinny red monkey with a lil whip
Yawn.
Yay
No thank you. Looks like a video game aimed at kids. Fully devoid of character, dialogue and story. It's ok to have action and story.  Try it
Kong got infinity gauntlet and Godzilla watched to much of the Barbie Movie
This whole trailer is mind blowing
Vera level 🔥🔥 goosebumps 🔥🔥
Kong should now take the title of ‘King Kong’ now Scar King is hopefully out of the way.
Kong is Goku Godzilla is Vegeta both are working together to take their predators of their ancestors down.
Kong team 🔥
Poli sanam🔥🔥🔥
This Movie Is Gonna Be Epic Fire!
Super Saiyan Rosé!?
Are they about to wake up Mothra?
Godzilla and Kingkong = Deadpool & Wolvirine ❤❤❤❤
Can we all agree that they've run out of ideas and should probably start hiring NON- J's to assist them with new movie ideas...
Im confused on who the enemy is here
godzilla is super saiyan rose and ssj blue
Looks like a lot of lame fake cgi with a ridiculously over the top story line.  Good luck losers.
😮
Waiting for Kongs  punch i know this is best ever punch happend 😍💥🔥👌
I don't understand the fact they need a mute girl in this movie. the only thing the audience is interested in is the battle of monsters.
This movie is going to be the best movie I’ve ever seen
Finally shimu has arrived
Idk if im the only but i saw some iffy cgi moments and seeing how its a little more than a month away i feel like they should delay it. Im not an expert in vfx so someone correct me if im wrong but i feel like the vfx artists would need more time.
Think that spike at the end of Skar King's whipe is a shimo spike?
Bro that's shimu! Shimu freezez Kong's axe and that's why it's gone!
Fast Five , Fast X now this ... Brazil has really been through it 😭😭😭
this movie franchise is getting better and better
My reaction to Kong punching Skar King's tooth out was : 😶
So there is going to be 2 godzillas?
Idk man.. i feel like it just Kong vs Scar movie. Godzilla there just for, mascot(?), like how Keanu Reeves appeared in Spongebob movie.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
IM NOT WATCHING THIS MOVIE BECAUSE A MONKEY HAS FEELINGS FOR A LITTLE GIRL.
I'm definitely gonna get high while watching this in the theater. 😆👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
lol who’s watching this junk
just watched Godzilla Minus One...some has to be brave to even consider watching this "monstruosity" after that masterpiece.
Looks fun!  (Still not as good as Godzilla: Minus One)
Yo is Godzilla getting the hesei radioactive blast thing?
Where is ultraman?  When we need him the most ,he's vanish .
So the had to give Kong the power fist to equal up with Godzilla?
Mothra spotted in Jia's vision
1:51 It's the first time I see Kong, very scared, very screwed. 😂
Hearing there's another new movie awhile back I said no thanks   Seeing this trailer: OK you have me officially interested
Seems getting silly now. Maybe should bring in ultraman. 😂
Hi mothra I see you in gia’s eyes 😍😍😍queen of the monsters is back
Eagerly waiting like
00:31 godzilla vs shimu ???
Its fire 🔥🔥
Is that the Voice Actor fo Fuse in Apex?
lindoooooooooooooooooooooo pohaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Couldn't get to see a glimpse of Shimo thou.. but the trailer is epic.. im waiting for its grand release 😊
So they’ve give kong armour oh god what a mess
They have gone a bit too transformers here.
Nah, this looks CRAZ!Y!! Wow! Excited!
I'm hype af
Kong hit Skar King and broke his teeth 😮😮😮
I Love Godzilla. Godzilla is above all.
Omgggggg this trailer makes me want to see it even more omggggg
Is this Planet of the Apes or Godzilla?
was that Mothras egg!?
Lets see who wins godzilla x kong or maybe shimo too vs the mighty skar king or scar king
Hollywood Godzilla becoming trash now, I hope this Godzilla will back to its root the epitome of disaster, no wonder Godzilla Minus One became the best ever Godzilla produce!
I guess Kong loses his axe to Shimo. Because we don't see him have it after he gets the gauntlet/hand brace.   Godzilla keeps his blue radiation for a bit in the movie. Either getting frozen or hibernating (so that he stores more power to fight) until the humans come to get him, so he will help kong against shimo and the scar king.  Godzilla even being afraid of Shimo, definitely will take him down and prove he is the king of the monsters. Even if Shimo froze Ghidorah.
At first i wanted old school bad guys. Not anymore 😂 this looks epic
CGI looks terrible.
What it is Shimo ???
MARCH 30 IS MY BIRTHDAY, I CANT WAIT FOR THIS🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🤯🤯
Scar dont want smoke with Godzilla 💪🏻 Kong about to whoop his skinny butt also 💪🏻
I’m excited for this but can the next one have a serious tone please? Miss the 2014 vibes
What is that ice breath in kong axe
Can already see the human characters being too much in this. Please don't do a Pacific Rim 2
I really wished they would have used monsters that already exist instead of new ones Megalon, Gigan, Hedorah, Destoroyah, Space Godzilla (maybe with a more unique name)
HOREY FOCKIN' SHET!!!
You can see Shimo multiple times if you pay attention and look closely.
めっちゃ豪華な怪獣プロレス。CGの作り込みに半端ない意気込みを感じます。子供向け東宝ゴジラの全盛期を今風に映像化した印象。これはこれで面白そうｗ
I don't know if I saw a trailer of godzila vs Kong or one type of anime, this is stranger
I love it! :) They know what the fans actually want. If Disney was doing this they would have made Kong non-binary, and Godzilla his lover.
looks better then that web movie.
❤❤❤
I’ve never seen Kong look so shocked
🔥🔥🔥
Was that curious George?!
I might check this out, but I have a feeling that it’s going to for me at least fall short of Godzilla minus 1.   That movie was so freaking good.
I need to watch it early in the morning.
2:48 We can c the scar wipe sparking
Another forgettable movie in the list.
Are they going to release this first before season 2 of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters?
"...was almost the end of Kong"  You didn't have to do us Kong fans like that with that line.
So there's another Godzilla thing?
I came.
The tooth💀
RIO DE JANEIRO VAMBORA MLKKKKKKKKKK
Was that a frost beast?????
Can’t wait  ❤
This is EPICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
2:03 that running though
Will Kong have electric power like in showa version with the BEAST glove?  And finally Goji enter his Millenium version!!!!
Ppl should stop caring about logic and watch the movie just as it is. I mean, it's a gigantic lizard and a giant monke fighting a giant orange monke. Just enjoy it instead of analyzing everything about how it won't work in real life ffs
WE'RE DESTROYING ANOTHER CITY AND MILLIONS OF LIVES WITH THIS ONE 🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shimo, freezing beam
I got chills. Time to go back to the movies!!
Where's shimo
It is epic
LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sexo gei en la playa
#ReleaseCoyoteVsAcme
Shot of Shimo head at 2:27
At 0:31 seconds if you pause at the right time you can see shimo fighting godzilla in the top right corner and in Jia's eye you can see mothra
Yooo this is epic AF, 2:19 they just had to tease a rematch between the two, big boi Kong needs to let that W go lol.
King kong has a hulk hand now?.. you guys can have all this godzilla stuff im good.
I can't wait for it
Super Saiyan Rose & Super Saiyan Blue ? I'm also waiting Godzilla merge with Kong into KONGZILLA 🙏🏻
What and who is shimo? Never heard of it
can't wait
Something is coming
Shimu
King Kong vs King Louie😭😭lets gooo
What I liked about Godzilla v Kong was that the big fight was in a scene that was easy to read. Lots of light on both characters, instead of a dark, somewhat distant affair in KoM.  Looks like they're fighting in Daylight now, so that's even better!
So there will be a another enemy? He'll yeah Kong vs Red Skull and Godzilla vs something else?
ever since i watched godzilla minus one, i dont have lower expectations for this movie
Bro this movie coming out on my birthday!
wow
Ladies and gents, I give you; Iron Kong.
You had me a Kong...
I can't wait😊
So basically there is 2 kong and godzilla
Fast and furious 2.0
skar king challanges kong
I should've known that Godzilla would be like the heisei Godzilla 😅
This looks so dumb... and I am totally here for it.
Man im hyped for this movie, but once again it looks like godzilla is gonna get some outside assistance from the humans! Stop doing this every damn movie basically.
Definitely seeing this
Br😮
If you slow down 0:32 you can see scar king and probably doug then Godzilla vs Shimo
This is weird lol
Ngl this looks like a boring cgi mess
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
Finally, the buddy cop movie I want to see.
🗑️🚮
0:51 2:31 DAMN, THAT GODZILLA DESIGN!
Bussin
I swear. Every movie that has perfectly polished and groomed actors in harrowing situations always ends up being dogwater
Did the Big G just go.... blue thermo?
GROOVY! I can't wait  to see this!!!! 🩷🩷🩷🩷
1. Why keep the buddy cop scene in the second trailer. It was the butt of all jokes last time.  2. Godzilla isn't afraid of nuffin. 3. Is that mothra golden glitter falling on the girl?
bro godzilla on his blue atomic form looked sick
🥱 Looks generic and boring af..  What’s everyone having for breakfast
Brother they keep replaying that scream omg LOL
or shimu
I love you monsterverse shimu vs Godzilla and the kong vs skar king and the mothra
tf did they do to godzilla's roar
bro shimo is huge
2024 and the cg still looks like videogame dogshit  Also, storywise, this looks really dumb
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
This new trailer is so cool man.
Welcome to the beginning of the end.....Of the monster universe.
So amazing
i love this franchise🥲
This is so epic!!
Next will be Godzilla x kong vs Pacific Rim x transformers
从《关公大战外星人》那里期待， 关公 vs King Kong  vs Godzilla
Godzilla got ultra instinct pink, kong got the infinity gauntlet, damn son 🔥🔥
Rise together or Fall alone, leessss goooooo, I AM PUMPED
At last…The Monsterverse will save the fans from the Superhero fatigue.
os camelo foram de F
amazing
Future MW3 bundles
Brazil!!!!🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Kong must have been going through hard times these past few years.  The rest of the cast look like they haven't aged a bit and Kong looks like he's served two terms as President
So zilla and kong have to team up against an ape? I hope thats not the actual main villan.
This looks so dumb.
You Know i would love see ultraman or jet jaguar in the monsterverse, that would so awesome
I think this fight is like godzilla pink vs apes red and kong gauntlet vs another godzilla
I literally rewatched the 2021 movie earlier this week and said we need a new godzilla vs kong. Mecha Godzilla was mad cool tho as a antagonist no that something like that is happening again is cool
I want to see this franchise go on forever🔥🔥🔥
This time could be big🔥🔥🔥
Lame af
Trailer showed the whole movie
I feel like a kid watching this
I CANT WAIT
The main viliian in this movie: a orangutansl
As long as more monster fights and less human screen time I'm all in
And shimu revealed
CGI looks like Marvel's low tier movies. Wonder if they're going to improve it before the movie comes out.
Now this isn’t argyle!  Lmao
Look at that after shin Godzilla and Godzilla minus one is really Pathetic  !
this seems to have the same problems of pacific rim:uprising : both kong and godzilla move too fast with respect to their mass, so their movements feel unnatural
Minus 1 already won
THIS LOOKS SOOO SICK
Looks ridiculous….. and I love it!!!!!
YO, this gonna be epik/epic
"We made some minor augmentations."  "What kind of minor augmentations?"  "The Thanos killing kind."
Is tiamut in this movie? I'm excited to know whether other titans are showing up
Theatre experience peak level loading.....🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why Godzilla Become a Bad Titan Again in This Trailer
Bro blue thermo and  and evoled godzilla
I’m glad Kong and Godzilla gonna have a mini rematch
Why there Godzilla nuclear form but blue one
boner acrraig
Bruh borrowed thanos's gaunlet💀
I think this movie may be as bad but still so good, as moonfall or even more.
I didn't like that they showed everything that is going to happen in the movie, but the movie will be interesting
2:27 Who is that on the right side
2:09
This looks so lame.
Kong looks like he's about to make the hardest choices because he has one of the strongest wills
That was a tooth 😂😂😂
OMG goose bumps!
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes of the Kaiju version 👍🏻👍🏻
SHUT UP AMD TAKE MY MONEY!!!
Soku should throw a rock at skar king to help kong and godzilla
I'm looking forward to this 🤩🤩🤩
The blue godzilla is super cool same as thye pick one
This is Going to be the best movie of the year alongside The Chainsaw man Reze arc Movie And Sonic 3
when the two fat kids in class fight the bully
Deadpool x Wolverine who???
Kongs like if you don’t  let me talk to you with words, then I’ll let my fist do the talking
Ohh no  Godzilla   he's still not friendly to kong  😅
So where's the bad guy?
❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢 oh beauty I love you wohhhh goosebumps 😂
This is way outta our imagination
1:56 Kong: I hate those blast things
Such a fall from grace from the 2014 Godzilla movie. Every sequel gets more cartoonish now. Smh.
Looks like we`re going a little Disney.
Look how they massacred my boy. SMH they MCU’d my favorite titans.
Whose the villain monster with the eyes 👀
Fingers crossed for secret Mothra reveal in this movie.
1:39
The shot of godzilla and kong together just gives goosebumps
Too much spoilers duuudeee
This looks so lame
I just love that these movies are basically just someone playing with their Godzilla and Kong toys put to film. It's excellent. I love these movies.
Ayeee
Ihr Spinner könnt mich mal kreuzweise! Unser Land zuerst= germany first 🤣🤣🤣
You can’t be serious
2:27 monke punch
2:27 shimo's face and tail!
Scar holding that mini red ape Looking mad at him
its coming back
0:30 how many of you noticed shimo
I think we're going to see 5 mega titans. I hope the CGI quality won't be like in the trailer. Godzilla's explosion is blue here, I think a whole plasma is waiting for us. Long live the king
Looks a bit trash to be honest
I wish it was on march 10 that's my birthday
superman x batman the animal and better edition
At 0:30 u will see Godzilla a shimu fighting for those who wanted to see shimu
This looks so stupid, but I love it.
I had goosebumps through the whole thing
damn kong got revenge from scar king stripping skin from kongs arm with his giant snake whip by infinity gauntlet punching and knocking a tooth out of skar king, the tooth is about the size of a car lol , that's how big these titans are lol
Just once i want a monster movie with the only people in the movie after getting smooshed and eaten
Anyone else notice Mothra in Jia's eye during the vision sequence?
With all these color gradients, the movie lost its horror and thrill. Preferring Godzilla 1998 and 2014 over it. Not gonna watch this 🐒
What in the ps2 graphics
Seems like yall forgot humans made Mecha-Godzilla which almost killed him… so if he’s a little mad still it’s kinda reasonable
Lemme guess... They'll both walk away just like they did in the past one right?? Yep not wasting my money again 🤣💀
The location is a desert, is this transformers 2 revenge of the fallen.
Now i want a Godzilla game
I think there will be two Godzilla's in this one, one the Guardian and the other pet of Skar King
Yooo Godzilla went Super Saiyan Rose 🥀 and Kong got the Iron Man arm lets go
❤❤❤
Godzilla fans
So uhh... Can I see the second giant lizard?
Alright guys if yall want to see shimo is at 2:27 u can see his face 👍
2:33 Neo Thermonuclear Godzilla 🤯🤯🤯😱😱😱
§tup°d
This trailer was awesome. I think this one has a very good chance to be better that the first
Bro turned into burning godzilla but blue
Woww did you notice, that's shimu fight with godzilla, is it real 00:31 😂
We got king with a infinity gauntlet before gta 6
Well it sure seem as bad and far from the source material as the other ones
shimu vai tomar bala no rio
You All know Godzilla is Gonna turn to Kong after their Roar and Be like, my Debts paid, Now buzz Off.... And walk away.
Happy Valentines day! Have a trailer about a Lizard and a monkey beating up a whoole army of Monkey's and a ice breathing lizard! Name a better love story
2024 gonna be super lit.  ❤❤
So they're hiding whatever it is that they're fighting. It's kind of nice to have a trailer actually hide a major plot point in the movie.
Interesting and it comes at March 29 and my birth day😃
Sigue wagner trabajando con china? me gustaria saber si vuelven a visitar algun pais asiatici
Va a ser peor que la anterior
SHIMU
I’m genuinely excited to see this. We’re done with the the MCU; monsterverse all the way!
GIVE US THE FLYING DROPKICK YOU COWARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I dont mind 20+ years of godzilla movie series like FnF 😂
So you are telling me that a red chimp is more dangerous than a three head space dragon.....I guess when you can't afford a Toho kaiju you have to come with a ridiculous thought
Good thing there are still japanese Godzilla films because Holly Molly this looks baaaaaaaaaddddddd
this is gonna be one of the hardest movies ever bro
Godzilla:  YEAHHH BABY THATS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THATS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT
The new Planet of the Apes looks dope
I love the Godzilla series. Godzilla Minus One is a harrowing story about the horrors of war and the hubris of humanity for thinking we can bend the forces of nature to our will without consequence. And then in the next Godzilla movie he has to save Brazil from an evil monkey with a whip. Some people might be inclined to read this as sarcasm and it's not, I love any film franchise that can pull both harrowing and dramatic and big awesome fun spectacle and is equally proud of both.
The gauntlet reminds me of Cyber WU from the King of the Monster 2
I can confirm by the trailer, this film is going to be dope just like its last films.
The dialogue is so bad.
So Madison and Mark aren’t coming back?
2:13 jesus wants a hug
Kong dynasty warriors
how did they make a movie of a giant gorilla and lizard look so epic!! Too geeked up!
like this movie WOULDN'T be one of the best films this year i highly doubt this wouldnt
Winter Soldier Kong visits Planet of the Apes. Just hope there's no Brokeback Mountain thrown in between Godzilla and Kong.
I’m good…
Love the movie idea, but I would like to see more of the lesser monsters like Rodan and mothra for a change
Look like scar king and shimo this time
Godzilla: Atomic Breath🔥  Kong: Gadgets👍
KASI LIAT SHIMU GOBLOK
BRUH NO ONE ASKED FOR THIS MOVIE. LIKE PUT THIS MUCH EFFORT INTO A DRAGON BALL MOVIE, TEKKEN OR EVEN STREET FIGHTER.
Legends never surrendered
the scenes are incridible
This keeps looking worse and worse. I'll stay with Monarch, thank you.
Can't wait for "This film was shot for real with no CGI" promo campaign to begin 🍿
Background Score and VFX  is Rocking.... 🔥
Love that they kept the ice titan in the dark.
Monkey brawling with a lizard will always be the most entertaining thing to watch
THAT. WAS. AWESOME.
i mean. this looks a bit dumb.
GYATTTTTTTTTT
Now enrile will be happy to see his peers again.
Again?
loooks doooooope
OOOOOO MYYYY GODDDD o q foi isso 😮😮😮😮
Where is Mothra? The egg had to hatch by now?
man the growth is insane with kong
THIS IS AWESOME CAN´T WAIT
Looks stupid!
This series getting more bonkers by the minute and I’m here for it..!!!
0:30 mothra?
Now that's the trailer that sales. They moved it from April 16th to March 29. They brought masculine Godzilla back. They showed why Kong is wearing the gauntlet glove. They showed the scare king in action and teased with some shadowing of Shimo. This Trailer gives Godzilla vs gidorra energy.
Kong with Infinity Gauntlet (Thanos) & Godzilla with Super Saiyan Rose (Beauty God form) --VERSUS-- Skar King with Whip Slash (Scorpion) & Space Godzilla? with Super Saiyan Blue Ice (Sub-Zero)  Tell me, What's more epic than this? 🤯
Hey and Doug?
Still don't know how I feel about this one. Guess I'll just have to go watch it.
When Kong Delivers A Brutal Punch A Skaar King Knockout On Tooth In The Words Of Rap  Mama Said Knock You Out
Shimuuuu
For a good laugh check out the 1962 "KING KONG VS GODZILLA" -- Directed by the one and only Ishirō Honda creator of GODZILLA.  It is so primitive!  One guy in an ape suit one guy in a lizard suit.  A laff riot. See a few clips.  You'll like the new stuff even more.
I thought this serries was over. Great god. Another bs movie. Bs woke actors.
0:30 Mothra's reflection in Jia's eyes
Man i am literally one of the biggest fans to Godzilla and the movie will be released a day after my birthday
Por q meten humanos siempre la ptmr...
Another 3rd thermo nuclear godzilla
1:52 New Trailer of GxK. My Fav part is the mystery eye's Character's
After watching minus one, this looks like saturday cartoons. Too colorful, too ridiculous
The super war Kong and Godzilla VS Scar King and Shimu.
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🔥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
0:31 Look at them fighting 😭😂 all  4 of them 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Why is there always a black guy as a comedic relief character in every sci-fi action adventure movie?😂
Ummmm, this looks really bad.....
After This Movie, He Is No Longer Kong, He Will Be "King Kong" 🔥💯
Kong got those Arcane gloves on 😂
Wtf is going on ?
We need Kong, the world needs him
This looks trash.
What is that.🥶
to xula la peli
My God this looks terrible.
Godzilla afraid? Bruh
I love the sound when Godzilla charges up...
0:30 Play at 0.25X speed and pause on the wide shot. Shimu is absolutely MASSIVE!!!
bruh that's Mr.Krab 's pincher
Can’t wait for 80 minutes of the film to be filled with hastily written human sub-plots that no one cares about…  But also.. BIG MONSTERS GO SMASH!
Fuggin hyped!!!
Team Ape still lives. Heck yeah!
Why is Godzilla is a rose color?
bro are there 3 godzillas
Godzilla on his throne saying bring the next poser.
Daaaamn, its been a while I didnt see a trailer that intense! 😮
So they just summed the movie in 3 minutes or what? This is not a trailer, this is the whole thing. Geez.
I’m SO looking forward to seeing this next month!❤ GO KONG & GODZILLA WOOAAH!!
PLEASE TAKE MY MONEY
2:50 Kong has a metal tooth.  Whole lotta teeth getting knocked tf out in this movie... I'm here for it
komg and goji fighting again? or what
EPIC
Enough Godzilla & King Kong bring something new 🐊
This is awesome  how Big G get his dinner by drone dropped mini nukes ❤🎉
This is like the first time in a few years I've been so excited to see a movie
Holy smoke 💨
1:35 hollow earth Colosseum Same time Colosseum was destroyed by gman
Did Godzilla get an elemental update?
Where’s Doug
well godzila and kong like each other because they make respects
WTF?
wow
Also their will be another godzilla.
Now THIS is a trailer! My excitement for this movie has finally arrived! 🔥🔥
This is Breathtaking !!! OMG I thought I passed out !! This is legendary!!!!!!!!!!!!! RIP POPS 🕊I PRAY GOD ALLOWS YOU TO WATCH THIS THREW MY EYES !!! Thank you for sharing these great legends with me as a child ! 🦎 🦍 👑❤️❤️❤️❤️‼️‼️‼️
I love this series
-"Now I've Seen Everything".   Yes indeed!
O.M.G 🔥🔥🔥
Wow
bad
This week is literally nice for us. We got deadpool 3 teaser & godzilla x cong trailer 2. ❤❤❤
Looks great👍 I definitely won't miss watching this movie !
I just can't fathom why anybody would want to watch this over something like Godzilla Minus One.  Like sure it's VFX eye candy but man you can just tell this is gonna be another mediocre Godzilla/Kong hype-train action flick.
Traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaash
This looks terrible 🤣
They literally add penguinz0 screaming
2:26 shimo on side skar king
Gonna be hard to beat Godzilla minus one storywise.  But this movie has those cheesy action scenes that's just pure popcorn entertainment.  Godzilla -1 didn't have that.
I'm Waiting to See Godzilla and Kong in theatres 🎥
This one is NOT directed exclusively by TOHO and not a japanese directed film. Hopefully its just as good as Minus One and not full of CGI BS....looks good though but we shall see...
2:40 whos that
Oh my 😎
Why does it look worse than the last movie? And what is the other ape? It looks skinny and small compared to Kong. They just keep messing up a good thing.
Bro i just edge to this
the dedication to the set director literally uprooting the pyramids 💖💖💖💖💖💖omg
This will be god dumb fun but it won't be as good as Godzilla Minus One
💪💪💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯 all in spectacular
This trailer has me going from six to midnight.
I was not excited about this movie AT ALL until this absolutely incredible trailer.
Hopefully we can feel the size of the monsters in this movie. Cloverfield was the last monster movie where as a viewer, we could feel the size of the monster based on the perspective we are given. Too many times we are viewing these monsters at eye level or from above. Really takes away from the scale.
This will be insane
I Freaking love this that new ape thingy idk is name but my lord when king punched him and he went into the ground love it also that ice monster apparently scared Kong and it shocked me but I thought that when the first Godzilla movies came out the one from 2015 I thought that was jsut gonna be a solo movie and wasn’t gonna get sequels but seeing this I’m glad it’s not just a one time movie and I am really loving godzillas new look and I hope that we get to see some of the old iconic monsters from the old movies like destroya and gigan and other monsters in future films
bro kong IS A DAD BRO WHO IS THE MOTHER tho?
We all know who it is Godzilla fears the most......... Destroyah  !!!!!!!!!
Did anyone notice Mothra in her eye reflection? 0:30
The Tohoverse (as I'd like to call it) is giving us serious and dramatic Godzilla films, while the Monsterverse embraces the insanity of the Showa, Heisei, and Millenium Eras. We're getting the best of both worlds, and I am here for it all!!
Naah dis bouta make me bus
dunno, looks silly xD
Looks so cool
I love godzilla. But this movie looks stupid.
This film won't touch the quality of Godzilla Minus One and yet Godzilla minus one will cost a fraction of this films production budget. This film will be a CGI mess.
Looks like the most uninteresting human characters in a movies since....the last king kong movies
Jesus needs a huuuug
Doug go brrr
So I'm kinda confused are we having 2 godzillas now?
They show to much in this trailer
Now all kong needs is the infinity stones and Godzilla needs to reach ultra instinct level 😂
This is the best trailer I’ve seen yet of Warner Bros. I love Godzilla and kong
who let them producers cook????
I'm so excited !
Looks like Godzilla is going to take a back seat to kong in this movie.
Mothra's power is back
Is no one gonna talk about the glowing thing on the end of skar kings whip….
After this it’s gonna be kong and the apes vs Godzilla and the monsters
So are the great apes like kong not actually titans in the opening she says the titans we the guardians of nature and the great apes where the guardians of humanity
Im beyond excited for this movieeeeeee boyyyyy
I saw Godzilla -1. It was one of the best movies i have ever seen. This is such a different movie and i am very excited about the addition to it. However, Godzilla fears nothing!  Not even Chuck Norris!
never knew I needed to see Godzilla and Kong running into battle together, but here we are!!
Ahhh but these are dumb fun popcorn movies.and I'm glad this franchise is hanging in there.
Owwww they are getting married 😍
Remember the halo jump from the 2014 Godzilla movie? This is a sequel to that.
Shims is in this movie
I kinda miss the old Godzilla 2014, when Godzilla was slow moving and intimidating, and now he runs faster than Kong himself
This looks like Pacific Rim: Uprising😢
fart
Pink Godzilla is hard to unwatch.  With the current cultural climate it feels like a cheap move to please some.  Also, f*cking Godzilla and pink just don`t go in the same frame.
They turn this into Trashformers.
I don't care if the story quality is not on par with Godzilla Minus One. I just want to watch more giant monsters in movie theaters doing crazy stuff!
Love gamma Goji’s design so much and now he can do Nuclear pulses like the heisei era! Keep going goji!
Thor: I AM THE GOD OF LIGHTNING Godzilla: 2:32
Worried on the first trailer, hyped on the second.
This was such a BAD TRAILER 😂😂😂  I’m so excited for the movie but man this was an awful trailer   First trailer was way better  This was a mess
Yesssssssssssssssssssssss
Godzilla minus one kicking this movies a** …..this is Godzilla and kongs  plus transformers plus avengers plus planet of the apes With and CGI excess 😂
Man love seeing kaiju films! Was in high school watching the Godzilla 2014 rumors and now a decade later I have my own home my own family I’m starting I can’t wait to show my kids one day this awesome franchise! Here’s hoping we see more of mothra! Jia don’t let me down with that vision!
Been rock solid for 6 hours now
Kong got his get-back on skar King from when skar King and shimo jumped him.
It look cool
ADAM CONGRATS TO YOU JUST MADE THE BEST MONSTERVERSE MOVIE
I’m so excited for this movie
Godzilla is just working with Kong to get that Kongussy😂😂😂😂
2:33 what was that scream i cant 😂
Give me a Phukking break……… dorks of the world rise up. Here’s another movie for you.
Next..x gamera
Primal Rage ✌💀
Who unleash icy beam? Kaiju or something else
OMG!!! OMG!!! OMG !!!
Yeah yeah yeah, just show us Godzilla and Kong talking to each other Godzilla Vs Gigan style then we’ll talk
1:13 I don't know that is his scream or is just some effect💀 But after that almost every 30sec of this trailer, That scream will just pop up💀
Godzilla just destroying bridges and killing random people but people still think he’s a good guy
So..? Primal Evolution Godzilla and Mega Buster King Kong..? I'm down👏🏼👏🏼😎
Godzilla has 2 colors now: Blue and Pink. W
My 5 year old is buzzing for this
Never end this!
So dope!!!
I can't explain what I feel about the run scene. It's the goofiest but also the coolest thing ever!!
Les go now we have an ape wearing infinity gaunlet and a lizard turn into pank👌👌🔥🔥🔥🔥👌👌👌👌
This is so absurdly stupid going from the more grounded original 2014 Godzilla film to somehow... this.... and I'm all for it. Absolutely love these movies.
Oh my god
Pah... poder rosado...???
No protenjen a la humanidad
Shimo🥶
Río de Janeiro
RAHHHHHHGHBBVVGG IM NOT WAITING GTA6 GOT LEAKED AND THIS MAY TOO
Wtf did this series of movies turn into. They MCU’fied them
2:32 Moist critical WOOOOOOH
Big lizard and big monkey vs skinny monkey and Frosted Flakes lizards. This movies looking great.
🥶🥶🥶❤️❤️🔥🔥👑👑. Kong and Godzilla... Waiting for the movie.
This looks so stupid. Even for a mindless monster movie, but alright, I’ll watch.
Kong with the Nintendo Power Glove. 😮
Even better than the first trailer
aaa
Chills Bro.... Pun intended
PTM! SIIIIIIIII!! El mono y la lagartija haciendo equipo es tan épico.
penguinz0 scream at 2:33
Less humans, more monsters lets go!
Damn I'm so pumped for this bring the fire baby!
crazy they are crazy
Mecha Kong and Yassified Godzilla fights Red old grumpy Orang-utan
Kong with gauntlet?? What he going to do next ? Use infinity stones?
Godzilla X Kong before GTA 6 💀
YEAH THIS IS SUPER SO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
METEOR STRIKE!!
This trailer proves that after this, legendary needs to make Primal Rage into a movie
Its like japanese 90s series but with biiiigggg budget.
king kong just casually broke skar king's tooth
I’m gonna go watch the movie fr
Im disappointed it kinda looks like planet of the apes underground has a villain thats like kong?? And is a little stronger than kong? And zilla? Idk man weird but it looks cool
THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY INSANE!
Don't bother buying me tickets because I'm already on the hype train.
so shimu is real
And Godzilla’s got that thermonuclear energy again but with a recolor from ku
Righteous
After a film like Godzilla, Minus One, I would never have the courage to release another one so soon. Good luck.
Ah, the trailer that revealed every facet of the plot, step by step, for the whole movie. :/
The actor who plays Godzilla is so dedicated, it feels like he must be jumping from one film set to another with how fast these movies with him are coming out. He LIVES for cinema!!
Guys if you but 0.25 slowmotion and stop on 1:39 you can see 3 other monkeys next to skar king that look quit big maybe his generals ???
Can’t wait
So its a 2v2!! LETS GO!!
Doom fist kong is crazy. At this point I’d like to see a transformers crossover
80 percentage  Only Kong better change the title Kong new empire
อยากดูแล้วโว้ยยยย
Já vi que na primeira luta Kong vai apanhar feio, mas vai de alguma forma "vencer" levando uma vantagem, porém o scar king vai apelar chamando o shimo aí Kong vai ver que a parada é muito mais séria 😢
Soo Pacific Rim, but we dont get the robots. Eh. Still looks worth it for the effects alone.
I've got a chill from my body to see this trailer❤❤
Looks horrible 🤢🤢🤢
Skar king is gonna be a damn menace even suko is afraid of him
Bwazzzz
For centuries there was harmony? Boy humans been killing each other for thousands of years 😂
Godzilla and kong will work together ❤ as friends
this trailer already gives us     50 percent the story 😢
Damn this trailer is epic ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🤩 and shimus ice breath looks so amazing 😍
Holy Sh** absolutely badass trailer, stoked for this movie!!!
Man that left hook from kong was personal
My god this looks bombastic. We need it. The world needs it.
Now we need a sequel.  Kong x Godzilla x Transformers x  Pacific Rim.  4 hours of action please.
This is awesome… but I would like to see more solo Godzilla films too
My God! This trailer is awesomeeee!!!
Kong: this is for tony stark
If you look at the video at 0.25 speed you could see godzilla biting shimu whilst king kong laying down whilst scar king jumping (finisher?)
Gimme my King Kong in power armor!!! NOW!!!
No way!! Kong got the powerfist from fallout!
2:33 i believe he did a EMP pulse or blast
This looks so incredibly dumb and I couldn't be more excited
How many Godzilla and Kong movies are there?
SHIMOOOOOOOOO
Man, Hollywood truly is running out of ideas. just look at the planet of the apes knock off in the trailer.
2:46 You can see the damage on Kong's hand, possible frostbite damage from Shimo's cryo breath in the 1:56 sequence of the trailer.
These movies are my WWE; dumb & silly, but SOOO much fun to watch. Take my money and give me my giant monkey & radioactive Lizard tag team Death Match! 🙌🏾
Godzilla: I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Empire!  Kong: your new empire!!?
THEY GOT GODZILLA AND SHIMO VS KONG AND SKAR IN THE SAME CITY YESSSIR
Anybody notice how when Kong punched Skar Kings tooth out, Scar was holding onto to Suko.. Kong is about to go crazy for the lil guy 💯💯💪🏽
I will be there on day one!
Claim your early tickets here!!!  🎫
It’s obvious when those two were together against the common enemy there’s no one they can’t defeat like all teammates. They have their differences, but that doesn’t mean they can’t work together. They should make this into a TV show Kong and Godzilla have it be mutants or monsters there’s no one those two can’t beat when they work together the king of monsters and the king of the apes those two are kings of their own kind. There’s no one to defeat them not even some psycho red Kong with a whip made out of bones.
I would love to have the money to go see this in the cinema, but alas it is not to be
They killed off Thanos… and gave the gauntlet to Kong! Holy GOT DAMN!!
So, it's bionic Kong and ultra instinct Godzilla vs. a giant baboon that thinks he's like Indiana Jones?
Scar king is not the main villain reason being he’s showing up to many times in the commercial we didn’t know nothing about robo zilla till the movie
Warner Bros has taken a lot and I mean A LOT from us and has screwed up dozens of times since the end of 21 but after this, this could be a new chance for them to redeem themselves. This is why some people still have hope WB for their efforts to make The Monsterverse.   The one that stands in Marvel's way.
I was hoping that since we got Mechagodzilla in the last movie.  We end up getting Mechakong in the new Godzilla movie
Wish they stayed grounded.
DUDE WAIT GODZILLA NOW HAS A HEISEI PULSE BLUE PULSE?
Godzilla gets a random power boost every movie. Absolutely nothing can stop him
we got kong with the infinity gauntlet and godzilla with super saiyan blue and rose how this happen in one flim???
Im ready!
Bro Kong got that look on his face at 1:51
Monke
as much as I'm looking forward to this movie, I'm still struggling to see scar king as a threat, he's just a bigger thinner Kong. unless he has some super power/s that can rival the big bads that came before him, they got this no dif.
Kong still a simp
Sometimes, less is more. It feels like everything is getting too big, too crazy that this just waters down Big G's and Kong's "dominance".   I can't explain it properly. But, only time will tell how this movie will perform.
peak
NGL THIS LOOK TRASH
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS!!!!! 😳😳
I can already tell I’m gonna hate Brian Henry in this.
Okay now im scared for kong
🔥🙌❤😤
If they play this right they could knock the MCU off their throne. @2:06 gave me goosebumps
Bro literally showed us the whole movie🥲
Terrible Trailer
Get back to work!
The fact that Godzilla can run faster than Kong is terrifying!!
Wait im confused? Can anyone help me here, Is that Godzilla or a different one that is the same species as godzilla in 1:52 . I realized the eyes were blue and the atomic breath was also blue but focusing more on the eyes, isnt godzillas eyes purple or pink now?
F****** awesome.. must must watch it!!! can't wait
Kong: I am Inevitable Godzilla: You seem strong, let's Fight! (Super Saiyan Rosé)
OK I’m not gonna lie shimo looks crazy
QUE BRUTAL!
what is the titan at 0:29, 0:54, 2:31 ? Look like Godzilla, not Shimu, but I thought Godzilla turns to rose this movie ?
I want to see this movie so bad
that punch kong throw at scar was crazy 🔥🔥
Really Good! Can't wait!
The 2014 version was the best! Godzilla was much more realistic! Now, the big lizard running like Usain Bolt???? 🤦🏻 I hope the movie will flop!
So if you watch closely, the anti-gravity theory is true.
Idc what the story is about, I just wanna see Godzilla and Kong move like Yuji and Todou
Kong made that punch personal Bros tooth fell out
Look, I don't care what anyone says.  This looks so amazingly fun and exciting.  I love that we have so many different types of Godzilla movies. One's that are Dark and serious with substance  As well as one's that are Fun and exciting for escapism.  Godzilla has always been a versatile character and people that think Godzilla should only be grounded and serious clearly don't understand the appeal of the franchise.  Godzilla Minus one was amazing, but it absolutely does NOT have to be the standard for the ENTIRE franchise. There is a Godzilla for everyone.  If this movie doesn't appeal to you, then clearly the Monsterverse just isn't for you. And that's okay. There are other Godzilla movies that suits your preference just like everyone else.  We G-fans don't really have any reason to be so upset and pessimistic. Again, there is a Godzilla for EVERYONE.
Kong vs Skar King is like Kratos vs Thor, the way Kong knocks Skar King's tooth out.
At minute 2:27 you can see Shimu hace at right Scar King face before he get's hit
Well... safe to say this has officially gone a different direction altogether.
As soon as Godzilla started running like a cartoon character and after seeing minus one, I'm skipping this one big time
This is going to be epic.
I CAN’T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE 🍿
They never wanted a universe, just Godzilla vs kong. This sucks
Can’t wait
1:43 Kong vs Skar King
Those pink eyes and spines are going to turn out to just be really bad pinkeye bacterial infection
Ok I take it back the CGI actually looks good now.
Bumblebee: I lend you my arm kong, don't forget to return it, Kong: *Grunt
How this mf go from fighting for some puss, to teleporting threw the multiverse
Hoping Godzilla's not the only titan in this. A whole bunch of apes and then just one non-ape seems a little skewed
Humanity so incompetent they have to rely on a giant lizard and gorilla to continue existing
When did Kong kill Thanos?
So is pronounced Godzilla Kong?
The only thing I hope for is that the orange baby kong wouldn't be an annoying child character that does nothing but gross humor and gets some ridiculous power-up at the end of the movie so he could do one final attack against the villain. It seems to be a trend with child characters in Hollywood movies from at least early 2010's. And if that's not the case then the film will be enjoyable, I'm sure of that.
Just name the movie what it is.  CGI vomit.
If they protect humanity, send them to Gaza. i see them in Egypt anyway. They're close enough.
I guess.
this looks like the greatest movie of all time! lets gooooo!!!!
American Godzilla is garbage
Yes; love it keep it coming 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kong done rko the mf orangutang
Yep, it's confirmed...godzilla is a super saiyan.😅
2:53 will be my new mancave poster
2:53 the roar of two was Goosebumps
YOOOOOOOO WTF IS THAAAAT OMGGGGG I'M SO HYPE AAHHHHH
Skar king is skinny
the power pack... awesome! 🤙👊👊
2:14 Looks like Godzilla being frozen
Kong got the Power Fist from Fallout bro 😮
Can't wait to see this one.
I kinda miss the ominous godzilla of 2014 and king of monsters
This could change the Monster-verse if Godzilla and Kong become besties after this film :)
Once you're an adult c'mon.... wtf is this. 😂
that's really cool bro
I love how at 0:31 you can clearly see shimu is fighting Godzilla
Wowww .... waiting
Bro I’m so hyped
Dude I can’t wait for this movie the fight scenes are gonna be so cool 😆
Wish we coulda gotten better human characters bc these ones ain’t it. Other than that I love the look of it.
I can't wait to watch this off newsgroups! 😅
Don't tell me Godzilla will be spamming those Nuclear Pulses 😭
This movie is gonna go hard as HAIL!!!!😂😂😂  Gotta do IMAX man.
big monster fights? cool.
I thought shimo wasn't gonna be in the trailer
I think they're showing a bit too much on this trailer honestly but it looks awesome
Bro them running together is so cool. This all feels like a anime
There's another being. Who is freeze breath? Damn I actually have no idea how many are going to be fighting Kong and Godzilla.
I meant shimo
This movie looks so bad...
Wait where does Skull Island: Rise of Kong fit into this?
Makin kemana mana ini film😂
So that was the whole movie😂
Who is in the trailer if you look closely
Is this really awesome or lame?! My brain cell is confused
I think I Poo my pants
This is not a trailer, it’s a 3-min long spoiler of everything that’s there to watch
Pretty much the whole movie.
2:13  shimo when zooming in
1:50 last time I seen Kong that scared was when Godzilla whooped him on the battleships
I don’t care about the plot of the movie. We came to see Kong and Godzilla do some destruction
So we even got Kong with Infinity Gauntlet before GTA 6
THE SMALL KONGGGG
Omg I am so geeked for this!!! Wow!!
I can't stop watching it! I love the roars at the end melt into the amazing title card chorus.
I am a big fan of Godzall
Godzilla looks way too epic in this, I wanna watch it now 💀
trash
Let's gooo
Kong vs gorilla
Yeah this trailer proved everyone that godzilla is still bigger than Scar King. Cuz Kong Scar King are literally the same exact size
SHIMUUUUUUUUUUU
Badass
I'm calling it. Space Godzilla is making an appearance  Edit: damn it. Thought he was finally on the big screen.
2:05 scene looks a lil too low budget cartoonish to me. I also don’t like how they made Kong inferior to Godzilla. The original King Kong was a beast!! This new guy is Kong the teddy  bear 😂
input into one of my must watch movie this year
so are those new apes part of Kong's family or are they his enemies? the baby one is just so adorable!!
Ok...March the 29th..GOOD FRIDAY.....indeed. I'll be there with bells on!
At the start, bro had super Saiyan blue😂
My hands is shaking
It's saying kong is not a titan
That punch was personal from Kong
Definitely i will watch this movie in theatre and it will be my first movie after covid19 which I will watch in cinema
Siperusak properti datang lagi
Wow. Transformers Kong  Amazing. Kaso, kelan pa release nito. Nakaka excite naman...
where the heck are they pulling all this Future Tech 😂😂😂😂😂
BEO THERE SHIMU TAHR AWSOME
Man these movies are getting absurd
Godzilla minus one
Electric monkey finally 2:49
Godzilla and Kong has come to Brazil
Literally we got Kong holding an infinity gauntlet with the damn stones and Godzilla Super Saiyan Rose fighting against Furious George. Really can’t wait for it to come out
wait so who are they fighting? just that other ape or is there something else?
Shimu looking a lot like Godzilla or am I tweaking ??
Pretty sure 90% of this movie is gonna be just people interaction
Why there always gotta be a character who's a little girl that has some kind of connection with the monsters
Oh Shimu can fly too?
Even as a hardcore kaiju fan that turns a blind eye to so many things this looks like one of the worst movies the genre has ever seen, I mean the mv movies could be kinda mediocre but this looks absolutely abhorrent
Le cinéma.
Now that's a trailer!
Godzilla and King Kong destroying, Rio de Janeiro i am down for that.
Yoooooooo
Looks like fun! Great VFX!
This is getting a whole lot bigger
These series keeps going down the drain
HOLLY HECK YEAHH
I  CAN'T WAIT
1:21 It's a Mini Kong.
It looks good but the scene of Godzilla and Kong running together looks so lame and poorly put together. It doesn't seem like the motions they would normally use.
This is going to be epic
This is EPIC!!!
i just know mothra is going to return this time
I just want to see the G-Man do his tail slide dropkick.
So is this all being made up as they go? Or does this type of thing exist somewhere in previous comics or movies or whatever 😂
im sorry this is cool and all, but why does this feel like your generic superhero movie? this feels like a new power rangers/mecha movie (not saying it's bad but this just doesnt feels right)
That is insane 🤯
Looks dope
I’m praying to see Rodan movie is gonna be amazing either way though
this is gonna be sick
YESSS!!!! Ridiculousness to the MAX , I'm IN!
Please stop making these movies 🤦🏻‍♂️
Godzilla with a turbo engine he is faster now 😂😂
Oh I’m sooo in there
*A new foe has appeared!*
Why does this remind me of Batman V Superman?
Oh this is gonna be so awesome!
Not expecting much but a great time with the family in the theater
Please give us destroyah in the next movie!
2:26 omg I didn’t notice this at first but when Kong is punching scar king you can see shimo staring at them
The visuals are so beautiful and clear . Amazing 👏
This looks like the dumbest movie of all time. 😂
SHIMMMUUUUUU!!!!!
I'm half expecting Kong to get a giant gun next.🤷
👀
I thought I was gonna come out March 15 1:53 is that Shino 0:31
Lets gooo Godzilla is going Dragon Ball Super mode Super Saiyan Rose and Ssj Blue aswell 🔥
WE WANT DOUG
Will anyone talk about 1:55 ?! Like bro I think that’s that other powerful kaiju idk
30 Secs in, at .25 speed, you see mothra in her eyes
Pause at 0:31 .
So its Lizard & Gorilla vs Orang Utan?
The tooth though lol
I’m hyped
THIS IS SO FRICKING SICK!!!
Did shimu broke Kong axe 🪓 in the battle.
where doug
The part where Godzilla expands, I saw scar king and the craziest part was I saw SHIMO on the right next to a pink dinosaur
Oiiii
ATOMIC PULSE IS COMING BACK
Never really cared about Kong. Godzilla always seemed cooler, stronger and more fun to me!
Wow... LoL This looks ... LoL...
Just saw the whole movie in the trailer thanks
omg
Is amazing movie
i love warner bros. period
Cada vez más emocionado 😍
Pause at 0:31 u can see shimu
Where's Gamera?
Yikes this looks awful.
If you just can't simply wait 👇🏾
*SHIMU?!?!?!?!?!?*
I’m gonna need more weed
Gen Alpha would describe this film as: 'mad lit' Generation Z: 'lacking in diversification with no moral compass' Millennials: 'this is stupid... im in' Generation X: 'Ding Dong!' The Baby Boomer Generation: 'Will this be on DirecTV?' The Silent Generation: '...'
15-2-24 2:30
👍👍👍👍
Uh
Godzilla enter his coquette era 💝🎀
Kong's out here rocking a freaking power fist!
Looks like the best one yet !
Ambatapilow Ambatukaaaam
We in here! Day one! Haha who am I kidding this probably won't release here in Japan until next winter 🤣
I’m tired boss
このクソダサい走り方は修正する気ないんだな
Who else is ready to see kong and godzilla kick skar king and shimo butt
Amazing!
Monkes are super cool
Stupid!
My girlfriend may have left me on Valentine’s Day, but Godzilla and kong didn’t.
Popcorn movies back on the menu boys
TF GODZILLA WENT THERMO AGAIN?DUDEEE THIS FILM GOING TO BE EPIC
0:31 2vs2
Bro kong has never shown fear like that💀
After watching Godzilla Minus One these Hollywood versions are a complete joke
About 1:15, while Kong is running through the Hollow Earth, it looks like ice is forming to his left behind him. Pretty sure Shimo is after him.
LEEEEEETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Can we have this now please 🙏
I can’t stop watching it 😫😫😫
You got Bumblebee, G.I Joe, and Godzilla+Kong. What else are we missing? lol
I love the trailer but just to see an little glimpse of shimus breath is outstanding and also to see kong a little bit more than often for screen time is amazing
so Godzilla is bieng controlled by the Orangutan that's why he was glowing pink
Oh lord, cinema is so dead.
Oh my gash my assumptions are right. Kong will focus with skar king and Godzilla will focus with shimu. OH MY GASH THIS TRAILER....I CAN'T BREATH 😱😱😱
This movie is gonna look insane in 3D.  I can't believe Toby Emmerich was killing off 3D for this movie. Thank goodness he's fired.
I didn't feel this hyped for a trailer since Infinity War 🤯🤯can't wait to watch this
This looks so goofy and dumb😭😭😭 I’ll be their day 1
Kong really representing the Brotherhood of Steel with that Power Fist
did godzilla did his pulse?
I didn’t think this could get even more stupid
So i defintely go chills from this..
Team Godzilla and Team Kong, ITS TIME WE UNITE, AND STRIKE AS ONE!!!!! IF THE SKAR KING WANTS A FIGHT, WE GIVE HIM A FIGHT!!!! FIGHT FOR OUR NEW FRONTIERS!!!!!! (*Castle That Burns (HOAA:R) start playing*)
YOOOOO NEW GODZILLA HERE I COME
They have no right to make this trailer as hardcore as ever. It's so good!!! I love how they gave us the premise that Godzilla and Kong aren't friends now. They still have that blood feud going on but are forced to work together to protect the world from dangerous threats.
This franchise gets better each time. Wow!
There better be a reason the humans are attacking Godzilla AGAIN or they definitely learned nothing from the last one, still mad at Monarch for abnadoing him like that after using him as a weapon and research tool for years
OMG 😱
Wonder why Shimu not shown as much. Like after scar king get defeated. Shimu gonna come out like "ok yalls warmup is over, now it's game time"
I heard tyler1 screaming like 3 times in this trailer. I might be trippin...
Goddamned! I had goosebumps all over me 😱
Goddamned! I had goosebumps all over me 😱
Anyone remember the godzilla cartoon?
If you slow it down when Kong delivered that meaty punch to skar king you can actually see that skar king is holding that mini Kong
This is going to be so badass, can't wait
Shimu is better villain, cgi become the worst now . 2014 still the best . This is more Kong movie now, 😂
Woke up to see this. I think my day is gonna go well
Honestly, Godzilla Minus One was so incredible that I don’t even want to watch any more of these kinds of films
👍👍
That infinity gauntlet is going to be a laughing stock for Kong after watching it a few times...
Big monke
Give me what Warner smokes
The way they feed Godzilla with missile's just for him to explode again.
it looks very bad and it is completely different from the first few godzilla monsterverse movies we got. it looks like a marvel movie trailer. nonetheless i will still watch it for godzilla and godzilla only. i wish they made these movies more like godzilla 2014 and KOTM
I hate to say it as a Godzilla fan, but this looks so dumb...
Kong's parents: you can be anything you want to be.   Kong: I want to be the Winter Soldier.
NEW RECORD TRAILLER! . 😮😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤩🤩😎🗿
THIS TRAILER LOOKED MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE..BUT SAYING GODZILLA AND KONG IS AFRAID OF SOMETHING IS CRAZY
This will be the tag team match of all time
Pacific Rim (2013) is forever the greatest Kaiju film
My favorite movie franchise right now....🔥🔥🔥can't wait
So Kong and zilla are friends and there is an evil version of Kong, so is there evil zilla?
0:31 looks like Godzilla unleashed gameplay with 4 kaijus fighting at once with the overhead view.
I’m gonna run 🏃🏻 naked in the streets right now 🔥🔥🥵🔥🔥💓💕🫶😳I’m in love with the monsterverse  goosebumps after goosebumps!!I’m hyped I’ll bring my entire family with me,they will be all dragged to the movie theater! Consider our tickets 🎫 already purchased I always knew Adam wingard will deliver my my no words 😶!
I never imagined that Kong would litteraly get turned into kratos
HYYYPPPEEE
Me estoy muriendo de ganas de que ya llegue
It will become the transformers: stated good and became trash
Whammala ithaanda hype hu 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Woke garbage
Okay I can't see no more!
The part where kong turns to the camera and says "it's clobberin' time' literal chills
this movie looks ridiculous(ly great).
2024 keeps dropping hits , all 2024 bangers.This is the year of cinema/TV
So who is the baby ape everyone is ignoring 😅
I think I'm more excited for the pitch meeting of this movie than I am for the movie itself. Ryan is gonna have plenty of material for sure.
wait so there's anther Godzilla?
if u pause it at 31 seconds you can see shino fighting giodzilla
This looks like garbage…
I cannot wait for this. Hard to believe it’s cover a month away still…
There are 2 Godzillas now?
Simplesmente, uma obra de arte
Kong is like Warner bros thanos and godzilla like darkseid
At this point I'm just accepting that they're going full superhero movie (and not even like Showa or Heisei era but modern superhero cinema stylings) and leaving the moodier more serious stuff to the Japanese, which isn't the worst tradeoff. It's sad to me we went from 2014 to this but regardless of a change in grounding and tone (as evident in GvK) this does look fun and action packed.
HOLY FRIGGIN MOLY!!!!
What a load of garbage.
About time something exciting coming out.
Skar king must’ve said something bout Kong’s mom because what else triggers a punch like that😭😭
Oh no. The CGI doesn’t look that great. Almost looks cartoonish
Yessssssssssss
dang this is freaking cool. also, shimo's blue eyes 👀
That punch @2:27
Gamera?
Released a trailer right after Deadpool 💀
I knew that Nintendo Power Glove would come in handy one day.
Japan did it better. 👍🏿
Think the studio forgot what those monsters are, instead now they are turning into buddy cop kids Sunday morning session lol. Can we get back to making monster movie
I’m so so ready for a 2v2 of Godzilla and Kong vs Skar King and Shimo. I cannot wait for this movie!!!!!!!!
Not beating Minus One. Give us good human characters in this one, Monsterverse needs it
Is Godzilla pink or blue
Turning into the MCU one trailer at a time
See Godzilla Minus One, that's best Godzilla movie ever!
🎉
When Kong punched Skaar King , Skaar King was holding Suko by his neck.
If this Godzilla movie release i hype, and if sonic 3 release, i hype too
Why does the CGI looks so cheap? ...
we gettin Godzilla x Kong before GTA 6  thanks for thousand likes and i didnt edit to say that 😅
pls make sure that the last movie you make has destroyah in it
Can’t wait for this
I'm here for it.
that gauntlet is proof that iron man still lives!
Did anyone else just realize that Scar King's..... Wait, no it makes sense it was obvious he would have a sharp blade. Its literally called the Whipslash.
That is exactly what shouldn't happen, the producers see the opportunities, then the writers drag the series and eventually....(you know), every film must be made as if it were the last one.
I'm sticking to the old school
2014 - Let them fight! 2019 - we join the fight! 2021 - make em fight! 2024 - make a tag team and let them fight!!
Wow I thought I’m gonna dislike Godzilla due to his smaller size but I was wrong he looks damn good
🔊🔊🔊🎧🎧🎧🎥🎥🎥🎥
2:27 you can see Shimus face a little bit on the right hand side
Peak cinema.
Tremendo peliculon tendremos este 2024 😎
The worst of Godzilla mixed with the worst of american cinema: the Minya, Peanuts, jet jaguar, etc. era mixed with Transformers , Power Rangers and  Mary Sues ...
Definitely getting better at animation
The villain is a angry ginger with a whip.
Godzilla doesn't run
2:27 that punch was so personal💀
Wait there are 2 kongs and 2 godzilla’s?
buhh🤯💀
That's right, just keep piling on the same idea until its become some ridiculous nonsense. Way to go pink godzilla and marvel kong.
Expect some promotional merchandise in the theaters when 'The New Empire' launches March 29th...& of course, the new toy line-up in stores as well.
Like if they effed it wouldn't be any gayer
Beast titan with a whip
if you pause at around 31 seconds and look frame by frame you get a really good look at shimu fighting godzilla
We need destroyah
YO FREEZE THE FRAME AT 0:31 AND YOU SEE A PINK GODZILLA FIGHTING SHIMO AND ANOTHER ONE BLASTING SKAR KING AWAY.....
Oh man, Goji Center is gonna have fun with this one
LEZ FUKIN GOOOOOOOOO
Let's gooooooooo. Godzilla and Kong buddy cop movie 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Welp, there goes my expectations for the movie. If your not gonna add Goji's true purpose, the sins of mankind and the horror of nuclear weapons, just don't add him altogether.
Wow, this looks dumb
LOL
1:54 SHIMO
Nobody talking about Godzilla nuclear pulse without going burning.
Why do people get into this? so bad... americans just like gross bright colours flashing on screen.
I am going to lose my S***T when I see this in theaters!!!
I'm glad to see the comments enjoying it, but I don't like it. After watching Godzilla Minus One and even 2014 Godzilla, this just looks like a transformers movie, the threat of Godzilla on humanity doesn't feel there, and they needed to add sci fi spaceships just to insert humans into the story somehow. If you make everything big then nothing is big.
🔥
I’m getting g earth vibes from godzilla for some reason lol
Really..a Thanos glove on a gorilla..you Hollywood people are running out of ideas and it’s clear as day 😂😂 us in the comments could make a better movie tbh..damn shame
all titanus in Godzilla x kong the new Empire  Death jackals Evolved Godzilla Kong's Skar King Suko Shimu Thunder Godzilla(The reason why i call him thunder godzilla is because of his new Power)
This movie will be f*cking epiccccc❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Man Hollywood really only wants to hire girls that look like Zendaya, don't they? This look like garbage.
Also Godzilla looked badass when his whole body was glowing blue
this is so fking dumbbb less gooo
What. Why. What.
Guys, I think that Ice beam that was being emitted to the sky was from Shimo, Because I see something white moving by the ice floor. 2:12
Ok good. Finally they keep using the same actors instead of change them every movie.
Ok guys, shimo is extra very confirmed 🗿🔥
Garbage
Did anyone saw shimo in the trailer                              👇
Caldera😭
I can't wait for this movie to come out
Why do I keep on hearing WHOOOOO LETS GO BABYYYYY!!!!! Is penguinz0 in the movie??????
@2:13 Shimo blasting frost breath to the sky
At 1:53 that is definitely Shimu confirmed... Am I right or am I right?
😮😮😮
I DONT WANT TO SEE TRAILERS BUT 😢😢😢ITS CALLING ME
This is too good. The monsterverse Keeps on delivering.
This makes more sense why there is a normal Godzilla toy within the GxK line since Godzilla will appear in his normal state before he evolves
You guys can see shimo somewhere around 2:27
Unpopular opinion but Godzilla King of Monsters is the best movie in the monsterverse  And I've never seen a trailer as beautiful as of Godzilla KOTM ❤
We’re in the fast and furious silliness arc
Godzilla running while also moving his arms is the most normal thing I've seen today!!
Cant wait to take my 7 year old😎
We’ve entered the second Showa Era  Full & completely over the top
I would say "I can't believe how bad this looks", but i can believe how bad it looks. Pretty much what i expected.
A hora que o Shimu aparecer eu vou tremer as pernas
Dude seriously , how many times are they going to make the same movie over and over and over and over and over and over and over?
Meanwhile Godzilla Minus one hasn't even hit streaming yet 🙄
Are they gonna fuse too?
Extremely Wild!!!!! 💎💎💎💎💎
Good job everyone, we just saw a whole movie in a trailer again, see y’all when DP & W trailer comes out 😁
POV you realize suko is at the main battle
We finally met shimo at 1:53
Really feel pity for anyone who miss the chance to witness this film in cinema
1:54 Shimu
Let’s go
Oh boi
Mamaco
they are showing way too much in the trailer. I know the whole movie from 2 trailers. Come on WB
3월 29일까지 어떻게 기다리죠 벌써 재밌는데
Please make this a good film, like minus one
March is looking like a great month for movies
this  movie for kids 🤣🤣🤣
I don't care how stupid or ridiculous these movies get, I'm going to see it and love every minute of it
They should have put lebron James in this movie that would have been fire
O scar calvo que isso curti
LET’S GO BABY
My prediction......  Objectively: Probably terrible  Subjectively: Best movie of the year and you wont be able to tell me otherwise
Esse filme promete bastante
44 days away, the amount of hype i'm feeling is unreal.
Godzilla did the same ability compared to his thermonuclear form
Some of these shots would’ve been way cooler to be revealed by surprised in the actual movie, instead of the trailer.
no need to see the movie now… everything is spoiled…
Just please have Godzilla Minus one movies in the works. Rather take those story lines then whatever this is. How did we get a podcaster to be where he is at now? weird stuff.
1:45 "Get over here" (scorpion)
Yup yup yup I'm down!
why does godzilla scream sounds like that penguinzino one
No identity politics, no overwhelming message, just chaotic spectacle with some cool looking characters. An easy to digest, fun, movie.
I absolutely loved how Godzilla was in his thermonuclear form in blue
Ok Godzilla New Power : super Atomic Barbie Seiyan Breath and Kong's New Powerful Weapon : infinity Bumbke Bee Gauntlet to destroy more Powerful Titans : Scar and GodShimu.
eesta buenisma como la mama de ezequiel factoussss
Another garbage film Hollywood is dead
What if destroyah is in the end credits and thats whay theyre afriad of?
I cant be the only one that hears the Moistcritikal screams
I only saw shims eyes and atomic breath
This is comical
Nature protector get buff by nature. Human protector get buff by human.
Wow
Is it just me or is it getting closer every time?
mothra
can kong do a backflip?
Looks like they have arranged a fight between each of the four titans!!! 👍
Hobbs & Shaw 2 lookin sick
they still put that wack scene of godzilla running just to spite us haha its dumb asf but not enough to break it for me like halo showing his face
THIS IS GONNA SO FIRE 🔥 I LOVE THE 2 SO MUCH!
Wow they really turn the goat noises up to 11
Damn I swear these devices are constantly listening. I was just on the internet searching up Godzilla x Kong, then I come to YouTube and this gets recommended to me… but at least now I know they’re making this movie, so I guess it isn’t all bad.
What is this trash? Thought I accidentally clicked on a Transformers trailer.
this is tooooo epic for me ik ima cry if someone get hurt
I smiled when Kong punched the building
Just can't wait 😍💥🔥
So who is the second bad titan besides the other giant ape?
I see godzilla been getting some height growth👀👀
Caveman brain like monke and lizard
Shimo!
2:09 Avengers: The Kong Dynasty
I'm even more excited now that I've seen the 2nd trailer, can't wait to see Godzilla x Kong at the theater! :D
Looks so bad! Lol
I LOVE THIS ALREADY
They know who is coming, id say The Lord is coming, it's why they are afraid.😊
As soon as I seen Kong and Godzilla charging in to battle I grinned from ear to ear
Bro the action in this movie is going to be intense. I can’t wait for it.
It’s a blur Thermo yes!
"Somehow Palpatine returned!!"  ; )
its gonna be good guys
lmao the penguinz scream
FRAUD KING 😡 KONG WAS BEATING SKAR KING UP I KNEW HE WAS GONNA LOOK COOL BUT BE WEAK
Alright, gotta admit this looks already better than the first trailer.  (Edit) Okay, this looks awesome!
I want to watch the rest of this so badly but long trailers can pretty much count as spoilers.
0:54 some one explain to me is godzilla bigger?
If Tony stark had an ape, hold my beer!!
Fraco, estão apelando demais já.... Deus é mais!
Looks like stupid fun...Which is what this movie should be. Looking forward to taking my son to this one.
Guys ı love fantasy but this is too much
I think there is another leviathan
wow we just got a glimpse of shimu
F yeah!!
This looks retarded
Why isn't Millie bobby Brown there?
Godzilla lookin like the big bad of the movie 😂
Godzillas  is still too small.
Eventually they are just going to destroy every city on the earth lol.
This is gonna be fire I know it
This movie‘s gonna come out on the 29th that’s gonna be past my birthday I’m gonna be 12😮
So, the Titans and Great Apes are two different groups? Damn...
so I'll be booking off march 29th as well then, can't miss this
This looks like the most generic, uninteresting and bland movie. And whats with all the horns in the trailer.
#TEAMGK
Godzilla minus one: emotional story about learning to forgive yourself but also learning that everything can be gone in a instance when you live in a world with Godzilla because Godzilla is a monster of destruction  This movie: and here we have in this corner Kong and Godzilla once old enimes having to team up to to save the world and in this corner we have the one the only shimo the new powerhouse kaiju
Sorry but this looks like a movie I'd switch off...movies these days look like detailed cartoons with little substance .same old blue and green light effects you'd see in an old xbox game
overused drum beat: ☑️ trailer reveals whole plot: ☑️ deaf kid protagonist: ☑️ another female led film: ☑️ sidekick black guy: ☑️ diverisitification: aight bet😂
Less go shimo finally in here!!! So excited for this movie That punch by kong to scar king was personal💀💀💀
i don't like the quality of CGI, its all blury
#Kutufilm Min trailer baru
¡Pulso nuclear! Es Cine 🚬
выглядит мощно. лишь бы не было тупых шуточек
あぁー観てえーー！！！！
Only here because I saw Kong wielding the Infinity Gauntlet...
Oh, this wasn’t exactly what I had in mind when I typed Godzilla x Kong, but I’ll take what I can get.
At 0:30 you can see mothra in the eye of the girl for a few frames
All right originally I wasn’t really excited about this movie but now I’m kind of interested
Once a Kid , forever a Kid
Oh yeah!!! Trailer 2!! Epic!
I feel like another monkey but with red fur and a chain whip is kind of underwhelming
The exact same plot of the last movie. So more of the same? Sigh…
Well, I'm convinced
Idk if I’m the only one who saw this but at 0:31 u can see shimo on the right side fighting Godzilla
Would this be another kong based movie?
Holy $#!+  this was BADASS!!!
I remind you that they want to delete Coyote vs ACME for good?✊
I really dug this trailer. Looks fun.
Looks AWSOME
the audio with the kong scream sounds so bad in some parts of the trailer...
godzilla and kong going for a sparing match with their new feats will be insane!
Im getting Fast and Furious 7 vibes from this! 😂
Jokowi & Prabowo
i hate modern trailers.. they show the entire movie
Bring on the chaos!!!
Edging harder than ever
Why is it that king lost a finger to his right side but gets a metallic arm in his left
Godzilla atacando a kong de nuevo?
Pause @31 in the trailer and you will see the kong G skar and shimo together.
2:27 i think skar king is choking suko
Please make supersaiyanrose godzilla hiya
HYYYPE
0:30  кадар с панорамой их битвы и там отлично видно что Годзилла дерётся с шиму
Damn! That's so cool!!! I know we were all wishing for movie movie news, but I to my core believe more spoilers beyond the first two trailers. Sucks I saw this and I'm like yep. Those leaks I seen a post on fb are actually accurate. Gd. I'm still gonna see it, judge it, and perhaps return to this comment and cast judgement
What a time to be a Godzilla fan
2:26 That was the most epic punch ever
So both godzilla & kong got they owns villians both bigger to? Yeah this bout to be 🔥🔥🔥
Holy moly😳😳😳 This is gonna be Epic
After seeing minus one this is so embarrassing😂
Now I know why Kong got the infinity gauntlet!! Damn.. I'm way too excited for this movie... Giving me goosebumps, Those eyes of Shimo and spitting out the frost bite breath!!! ❤❤❤
0:30 MOTHRA
I love how everyone was crying woke over “Pink” Godzilla and acted like it somehow ruined the franchise.
Wow this looks amazing, not sure if anyone noticed at 30 seconds in Pause and see a glimpse of Shimu
kong literally has a doomfist gauntlet
First of all, is Godzilla good or bad rn? Second of all, is Godzilla purple or blue. Third of all, is Godzilla and Kong friends or what? Fourth of all, is this even Godzilla? Maybe these are just stupid questions, idk.
I see wayyy too much human talking
Brooooooo this movie is gonna be sick. I hope we get a movie with Destroyah some day too
Are the monsters background noise for the humans again?
Was that shimo eyes 👀 😳 and Godzilla new form look awesome 😎😎😎💪💪💪 and skar king has a weapon
1:22 he’s gonna be the monsterverse’s Kiko, calling it now.
Just showed the movie. Thanks a lot!
kong really love to punch
Bring back kajiu universe please
BOMBOCLAT 🔥🔥
wow this looks soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad hahahahahaa
Looks amazing.
This movie there is going to be a major backstory as to why Godzilla's and Kong's family hated each other.  That frost breath though; Shimo?
zilla running Like a primate is stupid
Kong got the Infinity Gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose!!
I'm sick of seeing a divine bi*ch who can  "feel everything" 🥴🤮 There's always gonna be a failure like this.
Looks dope tbh
Lol
Baby Monkey
Cmon man give Kong full body armor or sumn. Mans just a big gorilla fighting these supernova demons :(
Myyyy eyes is bloooding
God Damn, Kong Got Dat left hook and took his tooth out!
please never stop making these movies, lots of action and monsters, still makes me feel like a kid, god i love sci fi and godzilla
Yo did Kong just knocked the tooth outa Skar?! 😵
Wtfakkk  irreal sure
Godzilla e kong vão lutar no Brasil isso vai ser épico
Que película tan estúpida 😂
Dear Warner Brothers....Please remove or re-do the scene where Godzilla is running alongside Kong.  Godzilla doesn't run
GAHD DAYUM THEY GAVE THE MONKE A INFINITY GAUNTLET
Goku and Vegeta vs Broly
Aquilo foi o dente 🦷 do  skar king que voou do soco do Kong? Foi isso mesmo?
This movie will be the best of 2024, save this comment
Wow this looks great and very very epic I can't wait to see it 😊❤
Right about 2:27 into the trailer. If you pause it exactly, you can see Shimo in the bottom right
I wish there was a theatrical run with all the human scenes edited out so you can really enjoy this movie.
Epic!
Do we need the girl that can somehow sense or communicate with these monsters lol smh
So...can anyone explain why Godzilla is red now? Cause last we saw, his blast/energy was blue. What changed?
Looks horrible and unoriginal
And now Kong has the Infinity gaunlet
Out of all of this, I'm concerned that the Goa'uld Landing Site was destroyed :(
I don't care if the stories of these movies are kinda mid, these movies are just pure fun regardless
Sooo avengers v Kong next? Seeing as Kong already got the parts for hulk buster
DIG BICK
Is that Shimu???😮
The 10 yo in me is giggling uncontrollably.
I liked it more when they fought each other
crazy asf
Hypedd
SHIMOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
THIS IS HYPOEED
I need to watch it <3
hmmm curious what the Evil-Kong is teaming up with, I don't think he's single-handley going to take both our big titans down. Curious what that Ice-Beam on our Kong's axe was from, was hoping for Gigan to be teased but I guess that wouldn't explain the ice-beam.   idk what do you guys think?
Looks like we’re getting Kong vs Skar king and Godzilla vs Shimo at the same time  can’t wait
The war for supremacy begins anew. I look forward to seeing this in theaters.  Edit: Okay, so I don't expect anyone to believe me, but I just came here after watching the movie. Honestly, I think it is pretty good.
Did Kong just knock Scar King's molar out??? 😂😂😂
Wow
Never in my life when I would say I love this franchise, every movie blows my mind every single time & I can't wait til this gets released
We are at the IDGAF stage, I see...
This trailer is just HYPE! LETS FRICKIN GOOO
These movies know what we want and deliver
Awesome.....I can't wait!
Nossa cara, que trailer incrível!
Wait if scar king is bigger than king why are they the same height when they are fight
First they gave Kong  Thor's axe. Now they've given him Iron Man's gauntlet
Another kaiju this movie is gonna be hype
it feels like 2v2 warner is hiding something for Godzilla and later in the movie 3v1
The way skar king throwing a building just like in Pacific Rim Uprising😂
se ve malisima
Absolutely amazing guys keep it up!
Fresh off of Toho's, Oscar Nominated masterpiece, Godzilla Minus One, Legendary gives us this...
Nah the roar when there is when there going down in hallow earth is scary
This looks so bad
Happy Valentines Day Godzilla x Kong ♥️✨
I think 2024 will have a great collection of movies, First Deadpool and Wolverine. Now godzilla X kong.
meh
Godzilla Turn Super Saiyan then Kong became Thanos
CGI sucks
Americans are really doubling down on proving that they don't understand the whole Godzilla thing
2:43 THE TUNE SOUNDED LIKE SHOWA ERA KING KONG VS GODZILLA WOW
Peak
They Solidify the bond of King and Zilla...
Yeah. Minus 1 killed this movie.
How many of these dang Kong/Zilla movies are there? It feels like four or five come out per year now.
Yo this will be crazy
What in the CGI mess is that?
Esto es soberbiamente magistral....Epico... Colosal... adrenalina pura.....
Finally the mfs who were saying kong is stronger than Godzilla even the characters are saying the last they both met it's was the almost the end of kong
I don't know. Not looking good. Like the Fast & Furious group are making Godzilla movies.
So its time for the battle of battles of titans will happen! Kong vs Scarking, Godzilla vs Shimu
Godzilla got Thermonuclear Godzilla but without the "Thermo" and got the pink sh--, and Kong just DISRESPECTED Skar King
Keep in mind, Godzilla and Kong are Hundreds of feet tall. To see them Sprinting, they must be Running at 100mph.
This looks terrible
Looks woke and stupid that’s a no for me dog
Looks childish smh
They had to use the Godzilla and Kong running scene in this trailer too because it's so hard 🙏😭
No doubt that tooth is coming in a souvenir 😅
So many great movies coming out this year! I’m so excited! Deadpool 3, Godzilla and Kong, twisters, planet of the apes and quite place day one.
AMAZING!
Godzilla mothra and king Kong shemo
Bro scar king got knocked out
did I just see a freezing ice beam?
What a junk
Never stop making these movies. So hyped.
This looks fun and exciting but I'm bummed that Alexander Skarsgard won't be in this. Kinda the way I felt when Charlie Hunnam didn't return for Pacific Rim 2. But who knows, maybe he didn't want to come back.
After Godzilla minus one this looks like a transformers movie (not a compliment). But im in 😎
Less of this and more of Godzilla Minus One
Yaaay KONG getting some Respect 😂.. and when i saw Scar King and KONG fighting it looks like Scar King Cut off some Fingers of KONG's, idk, but this Trailer Was Awesome
As someone who has never seen any of these movies... I have no idea what the heck is going on 😂
Loving all the love to Godzilla this year! So many shows and movies coming
Did we just see shimo
Bro thats jet jaguar
2:38 😂😂😂
That rock and punch to the face was personal
Looks like mothra coming out of Godzillas flash
Am I going f*cking crazy or are there two Godzilla's in this movie??🤯🤯  If you can freeze frame at 00:31 by using .25x speed..You can actually see the one using the blue atomic pulse is a different godzilla which blasted kong and skar king away while theres the evolved godzilla and Shimo fighting in a distance...
Im tired of godzilla and king kongs beef. I want to watch just 1 movie where they all get along
just two words: F*CK YEAH
This trailer made me so excited it cured my diarrhea!
I would be super excited for this if I was 12 years old
Havent watch the first one bout to check it out, gaddam the way kong got hit with that rock the brown monkey threw lmfao
So excited🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔⬇️↕️↙️⬅️⬅️⬇️↔️↘️⬇️↖️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
I think this going to be terrible. The CGI looks bad and the story is way over the top. I may be wrong.
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So we're just going full on Transformers now huh?
so there is an ice godzilla
Beyond corny.
Skar king causing mayhem Rodan,methuselah,behemoth,Scylla,amhuluk, and tiamut: this ain’t my problem
The best video to watch on my new smartphone
2:28 Really? Have you seen a man eat his own head?
0:31 shimo and Godzilla look massive in that picture
Godzilla can now release atomic pulses without being thermo? cool
Looks garbage. The franchise is going in the mud
It'll be  2vs2 .
Gonna be EPIC!
Gs kong KONG GANG FOR LUDFFEEEEEE
1:09 Is that matpat?
2:28 after watching the trailer
Why do I keep hearing Moist Critikal in that sound effect?
baby kong and king kong fighting together 😢😭❗️
why’d they gotta make godzilla look retarded
Who's here after watching Monarch series 😬
does holywood actuallt know gizeh pyramids are next to a town ?
Yep
I’m waiting April
3.1 millions views in 5hrs on this trailer? Thats crazy!
Les gooo
Booooooreddd
Godzilla minus 1 looks better
This has got to be the movie of 2024
Oglądając zwiastun dostałem 2 zawały i 5 wylewów...nalezy wspomnieć że to wszystko w ciagu 3 minut. Ten film bedzie perełką roku 2024 a przynajmniej jedną z nich 🎖️
Never in my life when I would say I love this franchise, every movie blows my mind every single time & I can't wait til this gets released
Ok gotta be honest, this trailer hyped me way more than the first one. 😅
Kong was flabbergasted when Shimo appeared 😂
Finally Big time monster and Apes ready to destroy everything in front of them and save us.❤❤No  marvels super hero’s or DC hero’s  to save us now 🤣🤣🤣🤣 love this
This just looks silly now you can tell this difference from directors between king of monsters and this 🤣🤣
LESSSS GOOOO
Godzilla Minus One was more my vibe
Yooooo😭😭 the punch Bru I xant
Me n bro fr
If you pause you can see an argo or mothra in gias eyes 0:30
Bua😮
To much CGI, shame
LETS GET READY TO RUMBLE!!
Es lo mas estúpido que he visto hoy, cada día mas este universo se vuelve como Rapidos y Furiosos.
At 2 27 you get a good luck at shemo face before the punch
2.8 mill in 5 hours def bots
this feels like so much trash. 0 drama, 0 anticipation, everything feels fake and bad acting
Did anyone realize go to 30 seconds in the trailer you can actually see mothra in jia's eyes and if you go to 1.26 in the trailer you can see the mothra egg
This movie is finna be dope and probably the best in the Monsterverse  Godzilla and Kong fans be ready 🦎🦍👑
I'm liking that there's lingering tension between Godzilla and Kong, as well as the fact that Goji still seems to be a bit of a menace towards humans. It's giving me vibes that Kong will act as the Showa-era, heroic guardian (plus, the line about the "Great Apes" being protectors of humanity) while Godzilla is behaving more like he did in the Heisei films. A force of nature with his own agency and intentions who will, at least temporarily, ally with other kaiju and/or mankind to face a greater threat. I'm also curious if Kong's fearful reaction to Shimu is because he initially mistakes the glowing, blue eyes for Godzilla charging up his atomic breath?
Best Valentine's day gift. Can't wait to see it on the big screen!
I had set a strange mindset on thinking that there was as far as I can tell, 1 great monsterverse movie, King Of The Monsters. Which is my favorite and in my opinion the best film in the monsterverse.   This one seems like its actually about to be a solid 9/10. New kaiju, new interesting and grand lore, Kong and Godzilla Team up once more, This feels like its really becoming a grand scale of a film, trying to keeo the spirit of Godzilla alive, while truly cementing themselves as their separate yet good thing. Excited to see, good work to the team.
I’m so freaking hyped! The Monsterverse and Toho verse are soooo damn good right now 🤘
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WHERE'S THE MOTH!?
bring GODZILLA 2014 back please!
Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and is now Thanos Kong and Godzilla is now a Super Saiyan Rose and both try to fight off the Planet of the Apes.  Yea can't wait for the Official Trailer 3 where Kong gets the full IRONMAN suit upgrade and Godzilla fires out Rainbows from his mouth. This is gonna be epic garbarge as it's full on agenda and woke rubbish now.  Too much Human rubbish in this again, when it should be full Monsterverse.
Godzilla will always be king
no way this trilogy is better than current marvel films 😂
If Scar king can throw debris. then Scar King is Actually Ape titan in a Nutshell!
Kong with the gauntlet... Zilla with the super saiyan mode...
2:43 OH GOD KONG GOTS THE INFINITY GAUNTLET
0:30 that's mothra reflecting from jia's eye
vaya fumada
Godzilla being scared of something that he hasn't even fought yet. I never thought I'd see the day
That is godzilla 150% power bit then he becomes rose. And shimo is the atomic breath from the hollow earth scene
Just imagine Godzilla and Kong's world connected to Pacific Rim's world. These 2 titan be clapping others kaiju
Damn they're showing everything they literally just show the main Big Bad of this film the another Godzilla type mega titan.
Another fun but dumb movie it seems. Nice.
Its looks like a Circus
Take my $$$$!!!
PUTAQUEPARIU... que coisa linda!!!!
Mothra’s head 0:30 ! 🦋
Lsksjsidjdudmrod
The title makes it sound like they're getting shipped together
Godzilla running looks ridiculous
This is trash, we all know it. I hope it bombs in box office, because trash deserves to fail. Only positive comments here. I wonder why...
Kong knocked out Skar King's tooth like kratos did Thor
Mucho sexo
1:01 Obi wan?
In future godzilla movies I really want to see the return of ghidorah, rodan, mothra and eventually introduce Destoroyah
wooo awesome
I gotta stop watching trailers.  They really give too much away these days.  ¬.¬      I am exited for it though.
Films like these aren't trying to be oscar worthy, they're just supposed to be mindless fun (and make a lot of money, which this surely will).
This movie looks absolutely incredible I can't wait to see it 😊❤😮🎉
🔥
0:31 OMG simo
Omgoodness can't wait!
Can't wait pure sci fi love it
This Godzilla vs baddy Godzilla from Minus one?? Who would win? I pick minus one.
Gonna nut.
Looks like a cartoon.
Scar king
0:31 shimo at 0x5
So far Godzilla Minus one is my favorite version. Japanese Godzilla > American Godzilla
my honest reaction: now this is epic
2:31  So, this is Monsterverse Godzilla version of the atomic pulse? I like it, reminds me of Heisei Godzilla's atomic pulse.
This movie is looking more like a fever dream by the minute 💀
I’m so tired of humans in this series
Can’t wait
Shimu eye
What kind of bs is that😂
I cant freaking wait
Just go all out...and give Kong an Iron Man suit.
ok first Doug better be in this. Second i did not know shimu was gonna be here, third i need to see this
Bruhhhhh This is sooooo fkin good Iam super excited for this 🥵🥵🥵🥵 BGM is crazy as well as the VFX and Action sequences 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Same movies over and over and over.
🔥✨👌🏻
I got goosebumps
🌚🗿 они просто сделают из динозавра и гориллы трансформеров ...
I haven't been this excited for a movie in a while 🔥🔥
Wait wth was that laser being shot at king was that another mecha 😮
Dan stevens?? Correct me if I am wrong.
You might be wondering why im wearing the white pants
The Rise of King Kong
Kong is taking some boxing classes. That punch says it all❤❤
After watching the Skull Island Netflix animated series, the Apple TV+ Monarch: Legacy of Monsters series, and Godzilla Minus One, I’m SO hyped for Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire. Long live Godzilla & King Kong, the Kings of the Monsters 👑👑  After seeing the MUTOs (Godzilla), the Skullcrawlers (Kong: Skull Island), King Ghidorah (Godzilla: King of the Monsters) and MechaGodzilla (Godzilla vs. Kong) hand Godzilla & King Kong (and Rodan & Mothra) their heads over the course of the MonsterVerse, I’m excited to see what Skar King and Shimo have in store for them & Suko  The MonsterVerse surpasses the Marvel Cinematic Universe (post-Infinity Saga) and the entire DC Extended Universe by miles on end  0:30 Mothra’s return 2:22 quote of the film
Sooo… as we see in the last bit: humanity still hasnt learned and they still drone strike the Gman
What a film
Anyone notice Kong ditches the battle axe and uses his new infinity boxing glove
I’m so ready for this !!
Team Titans ❤
They gave Kong a ****ING 40K POWERFIST!  It's ABSURD!! I ❤ IT!
They made bro Doomfist
mini kong!
True cinema
SHIMOOOO
I love how godzilla is just killing random people with no remorse and no one is pointing it out. Truly an American experience
So there is actually 2x Godzilla? 2x big monkeys except the slaves from King Scar
Godzilla Minus One was still the Godzilla film of all films!
¿Alguien más vio la pelea en la cuidad entre Kong y Godzilla vs Scar King y Shimu?
Finally we get something some footage on shimo
Chuck Norris ends this whole thing with one roundhouse.
Should I watch monarch to understand this ?
I need to see this!
Seems like a kong movie, got more king shots than Godzilla
How much do they milk the franchise? Like how much?
I think we have 2 godzilla
never have i seen something so stupid yet so cool
This is fire!!!!!!!!
Not going to like I had the biggest grin on my face this whole trailer
Q fodaaaa até me arrepiei
The person below me stole my comment from the last trailer
Can’t wait!!
Hmmm interesting
Is it just me or does this new Godzilla design look amazing with the new color
This is gonna be insane Godzilla vs Shimu
Who ever did the first trailer should be fired. That trailer did not convey the scale of how epic this movie looks.
I swear, that sound bite they keep playing sounds just like Critikal yelling "WOOOO!".
Wuh
Besides Deadpool, this is going to be the biggest movie this year
Kong has the Doomfist wtf 💀💀
2:27 anyone notice Shimo's head next to Skar king?
W trailer is it ok if I could react to it?
Godzilla Minus One makes this film look like trash. Only the OG fans would know what I mean too...might as well turn this into another Transformer or something. 💯
Keeps getting better and better
THIS IS GOING TO BE AWSOME
is this canon to the apple series "monarch"?
Here we go again!! Leave pyramids alone !!!!
I feel like I’m the only one who doesn’t care about watching Godzilla and Kong fight another monkey. There’s so many other monsters to pick from
Judging by the trailers, I think this is gonna be the best movie of the 5.
After the masterpiece that is Godzilla Minus One this shlocky cartoonish mess sounds so disappointing.  I liked the Legendary Godzilla movies up to now but this is too over-the-top goofy.
2:27 i even feel that
pretty good . Wow 🔥🔥
I’m gonna go ape wild and roar like a saiyan when this hits the theatres! Godzilla is still top monster tho. Roarrrrrrrrrrr, atomic blast!!! We ride at dawn!
This is gonna be good!!!!
Why march 19?
Ultraman can be of help for the fifth part
Best frikkin trailer I’ve seen so far hopefully BTSV tops that and hopefully GXK Is the best MonsterVerse movie ever and if you look closely when Godzilla and Kong are fighting Skar and Shimo in the blue explosion looks like Mothra’s shape
Im still hoping Mothra will appear on this movie 😢🙏
The deaf girl who's the answer to everything. Zzzzzzz.
Oh my
"something is coming" "something even kong and godzilla are afraid of" When something scares kong and godzilla you know things are about to go down  Kong And Godzilla Took Down Mechagodzilla  Godzilla took down 2 mutos and King Ghidorah Kong took down a octopus/squid and didn't back down from Godzilla Yet they are afraid of whats coming
I gotta be honest movie seems mid. Kong having a gauntlet is weird, skull king or whatever looks kinda lame, and kongs hand was freezing when getting atomic breathed? I assumed that was a new godzilla or something but every other clip it seems kong/godzilla hate eachother, work together, then repeat. Its just weird
Godzilla can't beat that Orangutan by himself?
pls show them equally and dont just focus on kong again. Also keep the human screen time low
these kaiju just digivolved!
meh
Damn. I want to see Godzilla Not The Avengers
🐒🦎
Every time I see Kong and ol Zilla running together I get chills😂😂😂
If anything happens to Doug I swear to God
I always love when a new Planet of the Apes movie comes out.
Please. Stop.
Like how nobodys poijting out that there are hints of *biollante* 1: the eye, in jias eye peoole are saying its mothra, but to me, it looks more like either space godzilla ir biollante, the godzilla like shape body, the glow on the stomach. 2: the green to blue touch, seems familiar doesnt it? Almost looks like biollante. 3: whatever thise formstions are hovering over kong, kinda looks like tentacles/appendage.  Not saying it will happen (probably not sadly) but its a possibility.
Kong has a new secret weapon, called the gauntlet. And just like thanos, I'll see what kongs gauntlet can do. Megagodzilla, the robot beat Godzilla just so easy, but kong won. I want to see if Godzilla lives or kong. I'll see
This jawn looks crazy iwel.
Why they made Kong so weak?? I liked the 2005 kong. This new kong is...just soft.
Unbelievable, I have seen this trailer so many times and it still gives me goosebumps,  I think this is going to be one of the best movies in the last 2, 3 years
Looks extremely ok.
Humans: Kong cant stop this on his own…..he won’t be alone! Kong: Lemme go get my big homie!
Trailer is great but man I think they showed too much.
This actually looks really stupid. I don't think I can actually enjoy it after seeing godzilla minus one
The animal disappeared 0:02
2:30 I'm sorry, but I hear a familiar voice (or scream?) in this part 😂
shame about the cast! cringe af. 6/10 at best mark my words
This is amazing
FINALLY, THEY CAME TO BRAZIL
Too bad is from WB but it looks awesome
1:51 BRO REALIZED HE NOT BUILT FOR THIS
🤯
I’ll be there for the Dolby viewing!!!!!!!
This looks awfully unwatchable oh my god.
That punch from Kong to scar king was the most personal punch I’ve ever seen
WTF is that? 😂
It's konga time 👯
Finally! More Kaiju scenes
This looks so fun.
This is just embarrassing.
Man, the plot probably ain't gonna be all there, but danm this looks fun
This will set up KONG becoming KING KONG
Brutal
Now we've just gotta wait for Kong and Godzilla to team up with Gamera. Maybe after that Ultraman if they really want to go overboard with the fanservice kaiju team ups.
ITS CONFESSES SHIMU WILL BE IN THE MOVIE LETS GO
Uh oh
We have been waiting for this our whole lives...let them FGHT!
Lets fcking gooo im so excited for this movie
OH MY FKIN GOD 🥶🥶🥶😭😱😱😱THATS GONNA BE INCREDIBLE
This movie is so hyped, trailer looked amazing, hope they deliver it
Kong is a dad. Can't wait to see that.
This is going to bomb . Learn from Minus One
0:31 pause this frame guys
🇻🇳❤❤❤
2:28 that was a nasty punch
If you pause at 2:27 and look right next to star king you can see shimo
To be Honest after watching  "Godzilla Minus One" Now any Hollywood Godzilla is a kids Movie ,, Godzilla Minus one is the Best Godzilla movie ever made its a must watch
The shimu🥶🥶🥶
Wait until curious George gets a lil too curious…
Peak has arrived
1:44
Poor Egypt. First the Transformers, then the Titans.
2:33 MoistCr1TiKaL!
This is the sickest thing I've ever witnessed
Again please stop with kong 💀 no one AND I MEAN NO ONE WANTS HIM IN THESE MOVIES. He will never be on the same level as other kaijus and it’s a fact, these movies keep going down hill with adding him in and being on par with Godzilla 💀
Man, as a long time Godzilla fan, I gotta say this looks freaking awful.  Should have had Megalon and Gigan, you've got a good set up for it too.  This is trash for people with no sense.
we were saved by giant lizard and massive ape. thank god
Im to old for this sh🤦‍♂️
Wtf is this? Kong 2 featuring Godzilla?
They have literally destroyed 2 franchises making this BS. They would have to pause for the next 2-3 decades to go back to its origin.
That looks dumb.  I hope it's at least fun.
Bro stop watching this film man the plot- BIG MONSTER SMASH RAAAAAAAAAGH
Can’t wait to see Kong put that gangly monke in the dirt. I don’t like him already.
I think, it will have two godzilla
This was cool even scar king and Kong were fighting it was so coo
Are we not talking about Godzilla doing an actual nuclear pulse attack at 2:30. I always wanted to see that happen it reminds me of Earth Godzilla just a little.
I wonder who’s going to Win in a Fight between Skar King & Godzilla. 😬
É bom ver o Xamuel de volta aos cinemas 😂
Wow!! This looks INCREDIBLE!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
2:33 anyone else think that sounds like the penguinz0 meme?😂
Movie looks cool.
This movie may have gotten a little silly, but i like silly! 😂
Brazil just mentioned???
Godzilla vs shimu is gonna be crazy
Now that’s a Trailer….🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let them fight, because we are going to war
LETS FUGGIN GO
0:30 wait isn't this mothra?
I have doubts that this will top Godzilla Minus One, but I'm still looking forward to this! Let's Go!!!!!!!
Wait!!! Did I just see a blue thermo Nuke Godzilla!!??
What month is this coming out?
I’m just waiting for the real king of villains to show up again, aka mecha king ghirorah,shi gonna be so epic since 1998
Kongs a real one. Won’t back down from the fight no matter how big or bad the other guy is lol.
Godzilla entering super saiyan, while Kong having a power gauntlet is something I never thought I would see
I can see why godzilla would want to destroy the pryamids before Japan and Egypt ruin them
Next month is gonna be amazing!! 🔥🔥🔥
Do we even care about plot and story accuracy anymore?  Just moar larj monke and larj lizard fighting, please!
Why is skar king so small
また中華臭そうな映画
I'm more excited about Godzilla's normal pulse being shown in movies
Movies like this make wish I was 13 again.  Definitely not my thing now at 41. But looks cool
I love how they casually show that Kong isn’t the last super ape on the planet that orange ape looks crazy though
everyone, grab their popcorn
Despues de ver Godzilla Minus One como que esta pelicula se me hace demasiado ireal y ridicula  🤔.
Hmmhmm MONKEH
Kong and Godzilla teaming up to stop Planet of the Giant Apes. Can't wait.
Wah ini sih jadi pertarungan paling epic di dunia monsterverse godzilla x Kong the new empire
The effects look good, but I am sure the story will be poor.
Omg I’m so freaking stoked!!
after Naruto Shippuden showed us, what giant battles can like, Hollywood ofc saw its potential..
Epic trailer of all time From the monsterverse Don't you agree
Power Fist Kong
What is it this time...? Aliens?
Godzilla grew arms, uh.
Writing by Chat GPT
0:31 you can see kong vs scar king and godzilla vs shimo
I know 2014 wasn’t the most entertaining storyline, but godzilla actually felt scary and badass in that film, it was actually trying to be a grounded film and be taken seriously, this is borderline Showa error of ridiculousness
Everything becomes superhero films now.
This movie's stunning visuals immerses viewers in a world where colossal titans clash against breathtaking backdrops. From the towering skyscrapers of urban metropolises to the vast, untamed landscapes, every scene is a visual feast.   The intricate details of Godzilla and Kong's designs, coupled with the seamless integration of CGI effects, bring these iconic monsters to life in jaw-dropping fashion. The trailer showcases epic battles filled with explosive action and dynamic camera work, promising a cinematic experience that is as visually impressive as it is exhilarating. With its meticulous attention to detail and awe-inspiring imagery, this film sets a new standard for blockbuster spectacle.  Looking forward to watching it.
Gaint monsters fighting again. Im there again. You see Hollywood its not that hard.
😮
The CGi looks… fake..
2:33 I screamed HEISEI GODZILLA when Godzilla pulsed, I remember when it was first used in 1989's Godzilla vs. Biollante
is there more than one godzilla or am i trippin
Who put the Iron Man arm on kong 🙄  Why does most new film's in a franchise get made shitier than the last one
They gonna get whooped and be saved at the end by Anguirus and Or Rodan.
A better crossover series than Predator X Alien
WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY
Best movie of the year is coming 🔥🔥🔥
BS.  They better not make Kong the big dawg.
Will there be a third trailer?
Gives of Vin diesel: "for family" vibes😂😂
So thats how homeboy lost his arm😂
This looks so stupid.   .... I'll be the first in theaters 😂
These guys should be in wrestlemania, nobody beating them as tag team partners 😂
0:30 (do trailer)  dá pra ver o Shimu do lado do Godzilla. O BICHO TÁ GIGANTE!
I hope they paying Kong overtime for all the fighting he will be doing.  Order based off of the trailer:  Kong/Scar King Rd. 1 Kong/Shimo Rd. 1 Kong/Godzilla Rd.3 (Sparring this time) Kong/Scar King Rd. 2 Kong and Godzilla/Scar King and Shimo
I am so excited 😆
Rise…of the MIDDLE…of the Planet of the Apes
Another boring movie with cool SFX and dumb dialogue.
B.
It looks alright I guess
You didn't have to make a new trailer. You know I gonna see it.
Just stop this already.
THE SAME DAY AS BEYONCE'S ALBUM WEERRRRKKK
this looks like the best movie of the year i cant tell you how exited i am.
im so happy we are going to see shimu
Maravilloso la escena del puñetazo con la prótesis robótica de Kong... Me encantó
CGI looks awful
Italy 🇮🇹
00:31 Godzilla vs Shimu
cant wait to see the true villain. prob a lizard-monkey hybrid.  the caves got some fkn
Monsterverse sucks balls, we need more movies like Minus One
Omg this is going to be the coolest Godzilla movie  I can't wait 🤩🤩🤩
Can't wait
this is sooooo stupid..... i love it
0.30 you can see Godzilla fighting shimo
otra mas de godzilla vs king kong? esta gente sigue en el 2012
seeing Kongs fight underground completely takes away from it being a monster movie. where's the sense of scale? just looks like a planet of the apes sequel.
0:31.... two godzilla?
10 🔥🔥🔥
Looks stupid. I'm in.
This is exactly the direction Gareth Edward’s would’ve taken if he’d stayed on for future sequels. I’m sure this’ll be 10x greater than Minus One. Thank you Legendary for totally not turning these movies into cartoons.
Shimos frozen breath 😮 🔥
I AM THERE!!!
2:38 Bro that throw was personal 💀
This reeks of mainstream desperation. I'm sure the corpo cucks will love it.
They are doing way to much in these movies
Ok so in my opinion, I think kong can defeat scar king but it makes more sense that shimo comes to back up scar king and that kong gets overwhelmed
This is what movies should be bro
Am I the only one that hears this constant, continuous roar throughout the whole trailer? I think it's a reference to Shimo, as the sounds starts as soon as he fires his ice blast at Kong.
1:25 Mothra cocoon. Called it!
🍻 im calling in if they don't give me that day off already let them know 😂
THIS IS GOING TO BE EPIC!!!
Brazil 🇧🇷
This looks horrible! What a disappointment to the franchise, just stop already.
Bueno... ya vimos toda la película
Man This Trailer Looks Awesome
Egypt 🇪🇬
Kong looks like he’s holding an oversized Leviathan axe when Shimu uses his ice breath
Wow this looks so bad
YESIR MAN I CANT WAIT I LOVE THIS ❤
kind of like the new twist on my classicl 1980s/90s Saturday afternoons of Kung fu science fiction and Goulardi (b horror flix) reruns
That creature that was like Godzilla, is that space Godzilla
Gen z consoomer cgi fart fest
Movies have become hopelessly infantile.
0:31 is that Godzilla and shimu wrestling
Big Lizza x Harambe: the New Monke
OMG, so much to unpack! The weird blue crystal at the end of Skar's Whipslash, Godzilla and his FINALLY CONFIRMED atomic pulse, MOTHRA, SHIMO, SUPER SAYAN ROSE AND THE POWER GLOBE! Also, I think the scene where Godzilla is being shot at by those plans is a flashback, because monarch surely wouldn't have to rely on such old tech!
TEAM KONG FROM WORLD ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is basically King Kong and Planet of the Apes combined
Loves these cheesy films. This one looks great
As someone who didn’t really like the first trailer, this looks really good
Can’t wait for ultra man to make his appearance
i like it when they’re friends, i hope they hold hands
Kong: Iron Simian.
where’s shimo
Is there two godzillas 😭 what made his spikes pink 😭😭
Godzilla an Kong ain't scared of anything
i was complaining the other week about how far fetched the fast & furious is and now I'm here all excited about a giant ape and lizard film.   🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🇬🇧
APALAGI INI COK
This looks TERRIBLE!  Just please give Japan the whole franchise back! smh
This is gonna be the dopest thing ever!!! Best Valentine’s Day for everybody. That’s real love for all of us KaiJu ￼fans🙌.
Brain... deconnected.... Me..... Likey
They did it. They went full regard.
yes yes yes
Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Breath Kong got the Infinity Stone and This is gonna be epic
I SEE SHIMUUUU
The fact this came out on Valentine’s Day is interesting to me.           Gives a whole new meaning to Godzilla x Kong
huge fan  of the saga
Yup.  All good. I'm in.
Kong ft. Godzilla
Why does there always need to be an idiot kid in these movies?
Kong would destroy that tiny headed gecko 🦎
From the previous trailer I thought skar king was bigger….   He’s supposed to be this huge threat I want him to wipe the floor with Godzilla and Kong or one of them at least
This takes me back to one of my favourite games on ps2 “War of the monsters”….. 😢💪🏼
This looks awesome. Let the negative comments begin!!!!
Did I Hear Priyanka Chopra Voice ?😱 @Warner Bros. Pictures
my 10 year old nephew was really excited when we saw the trailer and Im just not showing himthat  Im holding my girly screams inside. 😂😂😂
Damn burning Godzilla 2.0
I think Shimu is gonna be the final boss of the movie, perhaps pop outta nowhere if they defeat skar king
Yawn
Let’s goooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!  I’m ready!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's almost like 4 crossover. Godzilla x King Kong x Planet of the Apes x Transformer
ahhhh! im so hyped for this movie + we got a tiny look at shimo yay!
Ricky?
0:50 & 2:30 Godzilla's New Form!
King Kong meets The Iron Claw (Von Erich's extended family edition).
If you guys didn’t know at 2:27-28 scar king was holding the baby kong
They need to dap each other after that fr
0:31
A Frost-zilla?
I watched this more than twice
I will not never get tired of seeing a giant lizard punching a giant ape.
Omg 😱!!! I'm so fxxking excited!!
Let's goooo
Ek number tráiler i watch first day first show🎉
Can’t come soon enough
nice
Damn they finally show a glimpse of Shimu😭
Do us all a favor, relese the "No humans" cut. Nobody carea about the humans, just let us watch monsters fight eachother.
I’m hard rn
Cringe
I cant wait to rip a massive bowl and veg for a couple hours. Just insane.
So noone going to talk bout how godzilla waa getting bombarded h nuclears and he took started pulsing
They cgi is much MUCH BETTER
Way over the top. Are there any thought out, quality movies anymore?  Examples: The Patriot The Godfather Tombstone The Sandlot Shawshank Redemption Many others...
So...they're remaking the previous one...? Okay. To each their own, but it's a hard pass for me.
how did this get to trending but not deadpool
🙂👍
It should be "Kong: The New Empire"
Amazing! 😝👊🏻
Skar King: I have a Shimu Kong: I have a Godzilla  (btw. the frame at 00:30 with the tag team battle looks sick)
New Godzilla EMP attack???
2024 is gonna be a good year because of this movie
Why do I want to see this movie?
looks epic, but it's a pity, that they are moving too fast( remember how it was in the first two Godzillas, or in the Pacific Rim. these were slow, powerful movements of giants. I could feel their heaviness in every step. it was awesome. but not here(
A BLUE thermonuclear godzilla? Cool.
It’s the people in it makes the movie annoying
This is gonna be so exhilarating I cannot wait it's so hype
hype x10000
I think this movie has a good potential of being more successful than Kong vs Godzilla. I want this movie to outperform that movie. If this movie is successful, it can pave way for some legacy Godzilla enemies like Gigan, Destoroyah,  Megalon, or Biolante.
Ngl, this looks cooler than I expected, despite the fact I’m not such a monsterverse fan.
Legendary cooked
THIS IS SOO FRICKING COOL🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🎉
If kong don’t curb stomp scar after that punch just to disrespect him😂😂it’s all I see is him holding onto two buildings and just kicking his face and chest in
Too many quick edits
Mothra at 00:30  Big battle at 00:31  Shimus face at 2:27 you are welcome 👍
I am excited for this film
These damn movies are getting insane….. I better get my popcorn 🍿 ready!
Bro the punch that kong did to scar king is spectacular
I’m predicting that Kong will defeat Skar King either by axe or a neck snap.
bruh why
Idk this one just seems EXTRA ridiculous. they should keep it simple, this looks all over the place
They walk,run and  fight like humans that is sooo stupid
I’m sorry but i need this now-
Is this a brazilian reference?!
Eh I feel like it’s just filler
Can't wait
This is going to be amazing
Another godzilla
I love seeing the big guys busting nuts on the screen
Nobody can mess with Godzilla idc who you put him against he gon smack them back to yesterday 😂
2024 we eating good 💯
That felt like a whole movie in 3 minutes, can't wait
Who could have guessed the old Nintendo Power Glove was one size fits all!
Did Godzilla just do a blue nuclear pulse?
2:31 This is one of the best shots in this trailer, I can only wonder how good it's gonna look on the big screen!!
As an Overwatch player, this movie seems like Zarya Vs Doomfist.
Wheres my glorious king rodan
Can we Human just get Ultraman to Beat these Monster instead of rely on Mindless Creatures beating each other. Bruh come on.
LEEETTSSS GOOOOOO!!!!!!!🦍🦎
I’m predicting that Kong will defeat Skar King either by axe or a neck snap.
I just can't take these movies serious anymore. Say it what you want, but they completely ruined them, holywood does what it does best...
Hope its as good as it looka. 🙏
GODZILLA HAS A PULSE!
Finally
As a Godzilla fan i waited forever to see them team up.
OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Godzilla y king kong dos de los moustros favoritos
Imagine that evolution of Godzilla becomes thermo again
Bruh wut 😐
Seems like Skar King is not the only or the main villain in the movie? Something atomic breathes Kong after Skar King fight and it doesn't seem to be Godzilla. Kong seems scared and afraid looking at those glowing eyes.
My dumbass wondering why Godzilla isn’t pink
Looks silly but also Dope af :D
This series needs to end.
Lol, "these two" never get along, are they?😅
After minus one I want the films to have good human characters
Incoming peak!!!
Hope this one is better, last few movies were kinda lame
Humans attacking godzilla again
This looks like trash. It's an embarrassment since the most Godzilla film ever came out last year. It's a masterpiece.
People are saying at 2:25 that punch looks personal if you slow it down you would see King Scar choking baby kong bruh this movie is going to be good
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
this the series i never want to end🍿keep em coming!!!
Shouldn't scar king tooth be bigger it looks like its the same size as a car
Same day as Beyoncé act ii
next marvel team
Rebecca Hall is so bland🙄
So like is the whole story spoiled from this trailer?  And why does Scar King look like an angry drunk step dad? Looks like a king of the hill character 😂
Goofy ahh movie
"Something they're both afraid of." Please.
PRFCT😮😍
i was telling my friend we needed more shown in the teaser ...but this ? no mames  you are better off just releasing the entire movie
SHIMOO is conferred let’s goooooo
My brothers and sisters in Christ….we have a reason to go the movies again
this is kinda goofy and i like it! hope they collab with fast and furious
The trailer just spoiled the ending at the last part.
Skar king gives Koba vibes from planet of the apes😂
are there 2 godzillas?... pink body & white eyes😮
Shimo spotted at…  0:31 2:27
Didn’t see the first one still….. clicked this.
Fell asleep during this trailer and woke up halfway through, legit thought it was thr trailer fkr a different movie
The monster verse is doing a fast and furious
Godzilla Minus One > Hollywood’s Monsterverse
Let's be honest this is a Kong movie with the Big G making 2min appearance every now and then.  Why play with the G-man like this.
Bro please take these corny ahh human characters out this movie and make the movie seem more serious looking tbh it looks hella corny☠️
Godzilla has a thermo pulse??? Again?!?!?!
RAAAAAAAAA
😂😂😂😂😂😂Kong has gone full sci-fi
Godzilla: Did you feel that? King Kong: It felt like? Bully: Shazam Drive That Funky Soul by James Brown plays
where doug
Ah yes, the chosen child. I was worried they would leave out such an amazing plot point but nope, there it is.
I think kong will beat scar king in his first shodown with him but then he would use shimo to win
Come on, just show the orangutan with the atomic eye beams already.
GOJI’s got his Nuclear Pulse still
LES GO WE SEE SHIMO WRDCK KONGS TOOTHPICK
Generally, I've liked all the MonsterVerse movies so far.  This looks good too.  Something different.
2:13 if you take a screenshot and zoom into the blast from the bottom you can see Shimo releasing the blast on the piece of ice he’s standing on
It seems that Scar King is the King of Hollow Earth with Shimu being his pet I suppose. I imagine Kong will defeat which will grant him the title of King Kong 👑
0:31 if you can pause there is milisecond where its showing godzilla super saiyan rose and shimu scar and kong fighting
cool
This trailer was crazyyyyyyyy
Meu pipi está duro.
Bro these planet of the apes monkeys are everywhere💀
Kong with the Gauntlet 👏 👏
thank you for making this movie in 3 minute..
They need to get Godzilla from the 2000 movie in the monster verse
Did GODZILLA turn into SPACE GODZILLA
Seeing kong and Godzilla team up aswell as shimo and skar king team up is really cool to me.
😂😊Im soooooo excited yessssssssssssss❤❤❤❤❤
I'll never be tired of Kong Vs Godzilla story at any age, epic stuff 🔥
O monstro ia chegar no Rio de Janeiro e ser assaltado
These movies are beyond stupid and i absolutely love it
This Finna be the best movie
Yeeeeees ❤❤❤
Yeah you can say there is Harmony even in a planet by apes
It's a stupid video game!!!
0:30  ITS MOTHRA
Damnnn it’s going to be a bangerrr
I dont care bro every new trailer real or fake gets me hyped, cant wait for the movie!
THIS IS CRAAAZZY
Awesome
This is gonna be the most EPIC Godzilla movie ever!
I cannot describe my excitement level for this 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Godzilla,Mothra,Kong  G.M.K?   This movie should’ve been called Godzilla,Mothra,Kong: The New Empire
Time to see kids debating over who is stronger
Man these movies are starting to the jump the shark...
Wait   Godzilla got electric powers?
Godzilla minus 1 >>>>>>
I like the part where Kong was like  “And I am Monke” *snaps fingers and saves the universe*  Can’t wait to see this movie 😂
Cool
Red King Kong doesn't seem all that threatening. Just seems like the same old "Hero fights enemy with the same powerset as themselves" trope that ever.. single.. movie... does..
Thanks you ❤
First clip had me thinking they were doin a crossover with Michael Bay’s Transformers 🥴
They be milkin' this series for so long  like What is that Godzila and Kong side by side action!!? lmao
When Godzilla did the thing with the lightning towards the end of the trailer, all I heard was Moist Critical screaming
Broo.. brooo..bro bro bro…broooooo
I'm glad there's another titan villain besides the old giant orangutan
I love the mechanical hand
😱 OH MY GOD THE NEW TRAILER FOR GODZILLA X KONG THE NEW EMPIRE, 👌😉💯✔️ IT'S FREAKING COOLER THANKS GOD 🙏😇♥️💕 FOR THIS VIDEO , I JUST CAME FROM WORK LOL✌️ 😅💦
🔥🔥🔥
Now this is what i call action parked
Esse núcleo humano que atrapalha o bom desenvolvimento do filme.
Am i the only one that noticed Scar king holding baby kong when he got punched
2:36 Am I the only one who saw a frame of Mothra?
Does Scar king remind anyone else of Lankey Kong?
Biggest Film 🎥 of this Year 🎊🔥💯🔥🎊
This looks like complete and utter garbage.
kong has electrical powers and when his hearth stops the electric powers can revive him
So they're not going with the time re-jiggering effect of the hollow Earth that the show presented? What was the point of the show then?
Imma keep it a buck fifty, this looks like a mess. I miss the King of Monsters vibes.
When are they fighting The Avengers
OOH OH 😯 0:50  Looking at Kong's face, it seems Shemo was there 🥵 Finally 🔥🔥✅
Shimo is there, bois 🎉🎉🎉
I am a simple guy. I see giant beasts fight each other I upvote. Sometimes this is all I need.
Kong 's superman punch sent Skar king to Valhalla for a moment😂
Dio mio
You know, the Monsterverse is one of the few movie franchises that the creators still seem to care about as much as the fans. I'm SO excited for this. I always have a great time in the theater when one of these comes out. WHY CAN'T IT BE 2024!!
Yooooo!! I'm so frigging hyped!! That was amazing.
They should lose but plot
lame
I hate the CGI.The CGI looks so bad.I miss good old days , when there were using more practical effects , and less bad looking CGI.This will be an average movie , for teenageres.
awesome trailer cant wait to see it
Roman reigns kong 😂❤
Godzilla is burning again but much hotter
March this year or next year?
Already from this trailer, the #MonsterVerse is much, much, MUCH better then the MCUverse!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 The God and The King fighting together as one. This movie will be amazing! I mean just look at theses scenes.  0:14 0:51  1:41  1:53  2:04 2:27 F@#K OFF!!! Hands of my baby! 2:32  2:48  2:53
I'm pretty sure we just watched the best parts of this movie.
is all i want man, just monster fights on a giant screen. i couldnt care less if it is all cgi/pixel vomit i just want cool sequences and giant set pieces
😭😭👏🏿👏🏿🔥🔥💥💥❤️❤️
Pause at 0:31 you'll get the best view of the 4 titans fighting
Super Saiyan Rose is insane
Is that shimo in the second trailer
Never would have I imagined Godzilla and king running together
Im at 44 seconds into this and i had to stop cuz i cant waittttt soo ill stick to the first trailer that i saw 💯🤙🏼
2:27  OHHHHH that's a very heavy punch in the face
Guys did yu just see kong 's face just from the shear site of shimu that was dope
It just gets worse and worse with each shot.
Is this a joke
Movie of the year
Im sure pink Godzilla is somehow stronger than the blue. Woke Godzilla
Why I feel there another type of godzilla hiding in this trailer..Space Godzilla 🤔
I wanna see kong in full body Armor in the next Movie!
I didn't see any woke stuff? TAKE MY MONEY!
O M G!!!!
Looks great but why tell me the whole plot ffs 😂
I wish we had more original idea monsters and original ideas for why they fight
Godzilla vs shimu and king vs scar king epic
1:55 is that Shimo?
This looks so freaking good 👍
They're doubling down on that stupid little run.
The Legendary MonsterVerse is awesome and I won't hear any different. These movies know exactly what they are, and this looks like a wild ride.
Yo subredplay is right
i cant wait my favorite titans to be in new movie
SKREEEOOOOOOONK
We're almost there, guys😊
bulan apa
😍😍😍😍
So who is the big boss ? The father of Godzilla ?
Pause the video and click the time stamp 0:31, godzilla is fighting shimu and scar kings fighting like kong/the baby kong
I have a theory about Godzillas new design and how he changed. In the KoTM novelization, it was stated that Godzilla was able to adapt and evolve in able to survive. That being said, I think Godzilla knew he couldn't face all those Kongs at once, he simply wasn't agile or powerful enough. Goji proceeds to seal himself away in ice and he begins to "evolve", having longer and stronger arms, a thinner, more agile build capable for running and quicker movement speed, to top it all off a red spiral breath more powerful than his standard atomic breath we're all used too. This is just a theory of mine, and I'd personally would love to hear other peoples opinions and theories as well!!
OMG BLUE THERMO GODZILLA!?!! AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
0:31 looks like you can see Godzilla and Shimo scrapping in the aerial view
I not get Godzilla vibe this animated movie 😠😆😆😆
briga de mamaco gigante, obrigado Deus !!!!!!!
bruh , this looks dumb af wtf .
how many cuts in this piece? wow
Is this movie going to be KONG focused movie again? Disappointed to see barely enough footage of Godzilla and his form in this trailer
oh good they made it a transformers movie
Simply amazing 🤩
If kong has that gauntlet he could have just snapped his fingers so that both Shimo and scar king can just vanish
Love the trailer, and you gotta love how Kong put Scar King on his knees one-handed.
Wheres doug-
The ice godzilla scream sounds like moistcritical
That left hook was FILTHY 💀 2:27
ill wait till vod
This could be awesome, or awesomely bad.
Godzilla can’t run!
WHAT THE F**K? 😂
I just love it when I see Godzilla and Kong working together 😊
Too much 🔥💥 bout to happen!!!
When the first Godzilla movie came out, I was in my early teens. Now, I'm happily married and have a house. I am as excited as I was when the first movie came out. This is going to be a spectacle!
Love that these movies keep being made
These trailers keep getting better and better.
Espectacular el tráiler 🙌
So Godzilla and Kong are fighting Scorpion and Sub-Zero in Kaiju form....     I"M DOWN
You can tell Godzilla evolved in more ways than just getting more powerful. His build is slimmer, more robust instead of the bulky build from KotM, suggesting he's more build for land mobility. That's something that has been holding Godzilla back before, what with GvK having him struggle with the more agile Mecha-Godzilla. Combined with his longer arms suggests he evolved to be more capable of fighting on land, and also general movement on land as well since we see him keep pace with Kong in that last scene!!
Mothra!!! ❤ 0:30
I'd rather watch a full length film of orangutans and otters playing together than this.
1:50  watch in 0.25 kong face 😶😐😯🥶
raaaaaah kong chads and zilla bros together at last
This guy's putting the entire movie in trailer 🤦🏻‍♂️
God damn kong gave scarking a haymaker punch that was badass
Ill never not be excited about seeing these giants fighting, but they're going to run out of ideas pretty soon.
'Bibby man, I ain't got time for this. I just want my cut.'
HOLY MOLY
Pink Godzilla...oh boy...
Its very interesting that Godzilla and Kong made a truce at the end of the last film, but ultimately still value each other as enemies. As with Skar King, he looks incredible! Seeing him and Shimo give our two titan heroes a run for their money will be epic to watch on the big screen! One very long month away from a spectacular film. I CAN'T WAIT!
What a time to br a kaiju fan
Awesomee!
Skar Kings arm length is effen creepy
So goofy
This movie looks so f-ing fun!
This about to be the best movie this year.
but what if Shimo will be on the good guy side instead of the bad guy side
I have never seen a stupider premise to a movie I am definitely going to see, Thanks in advance WB.
0:30 IS HIM,OMG IS SHIMU
This will be again dumb AF but to be honest: give me good monster fights and Imma be happy.
Godzilla has played so many roles over the years: villain, hero, force of nature, restorer of balance, allegory, father, ally.… He’s the Meryl Streep of kaijus!!
New Godzilla form?
Not impressed
This looks great but I'm pretty annoyed that (in GvK too) they focus most of the lore while on Kong while Godzilla is there just for the point of it and gets a small side story.
Wow, who knew that Godzilla and kong has gained so much potential when they face every threat dangerous than before?, it seems to me, it has alot, I would honestly never get tired seeing this.
I never really liked these monster movies but the thought of godzilla fighting along side Kong goes so unbelievably hard 😭😭
Finally we get to see Godzillas regular pulse
Attack on titan
The earth cannot withstand such torture by humans. Fortunately, it is a Hollywood movie！
I like the part where Kong said "i am inevitable"
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This new movie is gonna be epic
Kong is inevitable.
Why is hollyweird trying to push this APE EMPIRE agenda? What do they know?
Wonder how Godzilla would react when he sees shimo 😅
Is scar king can control shimo?
Bro I had no idea suko was a beast he killed that adult king😱😱😱
Kong with the yellow glove, Godzilla with the pink energy and Shimu with the blue blasts. They making the monster Power Rangers? Next one gonna be green ✅
OMGpic
Ama watch this again  cus I love it wow  this is a #1 box office  globally  as well
Flashbacks to Revenge of the Fallen right off the bat 😂
2:27, there is shimo looking at kong looking goofya
Really hope Godzillas new evolved form is temporary and we get to go back to the classic 2014-2021 designs
So king kongs little ape friends are "something is coming" that they’re afraid off too?
We have to appreciate the courage of the director, cameraman and actors for working with such huge monsters!!
This not Godzilla or Kong movie this marvel Godzilla kong movie😂😠
Godzilla to kong in 2021: I hate you so much, I'll put an end to your monke business. Godzilla to kong in 2024: I still hate you but let's make a team.
2:53 THIS LITERALLY GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS 🔥🔥🔥
Let him cook This is going to be the best movie I have seen in a while
WTF is this?….hahah😅
another CGI masturbation fest
I love how they haven’t revealed Shimo yet, but we still get snip it’s in this trailer (0:31, 1:57, 2:13) I also think in the 2:13 mark, they are in Brazil due to the statue??
😂😂 so childish!! 5 year old me would be over the moon but for the DEI!! Oh the agendas!!
about time blue version of burning goji became official
It looks rubbish but I might be there to see it
0:31 ice thermo Godzilla?
I was knocked easily fr
Why does Kong have The Infinity Gauntlet?
How did we go from the actual grounded masterpiece of Godzilla 2014 to this dogshit
Big screen material for sure!
I’m the only one who’s prob not gonna understand this but why are Kong and Godzilla fighting again they had a truce in the last movie? The last movie was Godzilla vs. Kong why do they need to fight again?
bruhh why the avengers still only have 2 team members?
Time to move to venus. Higher life expectancy.
Godzilla running while also moving his arms is the most normal thing I've seen today!!
Let’s fricking go now no one can complain about gman’s new design, he has his blue energy in the movie.😝😝
That's crazy!
Godzilla is officially in his pink Super saiyan rose form and kong has an infinity gauntlet, now he just needs to find and collect the infinity stones in order to defeat Skar king and Shimo!
so the leaks were real
I think the next part will be  “ Kong vs Godzilla - Dinner party “
2:27 damn I didn’t think that was a tooth tbh
HAIL TO THE KINGS!!!
And the atomic dinosaur cause a rampage
I’ve never seen anything rip a top of a building off and throw it to get punched by King Kong. This is gonna be good
This is going to be epic.
this is lengedery
Someone finally found a use for the Nintendo Power glove 🦾
Bro I wanna see shimo!!!😒😒😟😟
I'm gonna have goosebumps next month
So it's the ice that hurts kong and not scar king. Good to know.
This gonna be a feast for eyes and ears  in bigscreen for sure❤
Wohooo😮
This trailer just gave me goosebumps!!!
This might be the most epic kaji showdown ever. My 10 year old self couldn't have asked for more!
They always bring these movies to the best settings for fights. We had Bridges, Lost Islands, Neon Cities, Oceans, Volcanos and now it looks like Egypt and more tropical lands! It really heightens the fights when the area around the fight is just as visually stunning and fun to look at.
I think gojicenter and legendary are partnered up npw
Bro I can’t wait for the movie I’m so hype that I can’t sleep anymore, i need it to come out today
Hopefully the monsters don’t get just 20 minutes of screen time 😅
You couldn't make it more soulless even if you tried, this looks so bad.
#1 on trending! Let's go!
This left me speechless 💀
*GODZILLA & KONG AVENGER-fied* :)
OMG!!!!!! OMG!!!!!
Bro there’s mothra too!!!
Why does this franchise get more ridiculous everytime
My God, this is the movie where Rodan, King Gidorah and Mothra should all just show up and let it be a brawl like the old old movies lmao.
Its funny watching monarch and see how straight and serious they are treating things. And this is just pure insanity, this is what tokusatsu is all about
That punch was personal 💀2:27
Ugh
That Shimo scene 🔥
"Kong can't stop this on his own." "He won't be alone."  Huh? Why? Who's he gonna be with? Oh, wait, probably Godzilla.
Never in a million years would I have  thought we would get King Kong and Godzilla running together!!
Of course the movie is full of stupid humans....
Skull Island was great. Godzilla was good. Now they've ruined it with this Michael Bay inspired direction
And we're back to the Showa era of Godzilla silliness...
I need my 4D glasses for this one🎉😢
Bro I am so happy that the Monsterverse is not taking itself seriously anymore it’s just doing dumb kaiju stuff.
Kong better not snap those fingers. We can’t go through all that again, I just got my girl back.
🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶
BRO WAS THAT SHIMU?!!
This gives me pacific rim 2 vibes
yup. ready for this one.
Жара!
This movie looks so amazing
Looks like this film is based around kong and he’s got his hands full. Look like he as a one on one with all three titans at some point
OMGG AYEE
Is it wrong for me to say I’m not exactly impressed? 😅
Too much talking
godzilla with all the blue on him looks like thermo blue
I love these 2 ❤ never enough
Try not gid rid of this one for tax ok WB
So the scar king is not the ruler there is another Godzilla bigger and badder this is gonna be dope
I NEED TO SEE THIS
I like how Godzilla went from barely walking in 2014 to full-on sprinting 10 years later!!
Bro that punch that Kong delivered to Skar King was the most personal thing I’ve seen in my life.
cant wait to see godzilla and kong fighting together again
1:53 OH MY GOD ITS SHIMO
This gon beeeeee epicccc
Esta va a estar bien buena!
This movie is gonna be the best movie awsome
What’s the big monster they are fighting?
2:27 we can see shimo face to the right side of scar king
I can't be the only one who thinks the numerous screams and yells in the trailer sound like that MositCritikal meme of him yelling! Seriously, go back and listen! 🤣
Miss the ambiance of the first Godzilla...
2:04 truly a goosebumps moment...
Now that’s a proper trailer
Little kong busting kong face with that rock throw🔥🔥🔥🤣
so much CG, might as be classified as an animated movie
It would be co if we could get a introduction to shimo tv spot
yeah this might be movie of the year. im hyped
This movie is coming out on my birthday this is awsome!!!
That was boring and basic 😂
2:50 when Kong punched the building 🫡 was to sick I knew that he would get some type of power in that glove I knew it wasn’t a regular arm brace
I knew it godzilla will evolved in the movie!
king kong now has a thanos glove!!
Guys, there is a question. 🤣 Why were the pyramids destroyed in the advertisement? 😅 I'm Egyptian and I'm shocked why the pyramid was split by Godzilla's fire. 😂😂 Oh, I think Khufu will be very sad. 🤣🤣🤣
Yo they really gave Kong a Power Fist 😄😂
I need to change my pants
Anyone figure out what the music is? It sounds familiar.
THIS IS AMAZING!!🤩🤩🤩👍👍👍
Planet of the Apes featuring Godzilla.
2:27 The fact Kong knocked Skar King’s tooth out that fast shows that Kong is one pissed off monkey 😤😂
Godzilla : "SUBARASHI"  Kong : " I am Inevitable "
This is gunna be so god Damm goofy and I’m here for it
Godzilla turning into Hybrid Godzilla will be perfect and epic. That means Godzilla will have 2 forms.
💎🦍💎
This is going to be epic! Godzilla going into ultimate beast mode!
2 contra 1 no mundo invertido , kong saí perdendo.  Mais quando godzilla vem pra ajudar aí sim .
0:30 Shimo is massive 😳
Was that penguinzo scream 2:34
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that SHIMU freezing Kongs axe?!?!?!🥶😱🥶😱🥶😱🥶😱🥶😱🥶😱
Wow so cool I can not wait for the movie scar king and kong fight that is just cool🎉🎉🎉❤
Hype hype Hype HYPE HYYYYPEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
Cool
Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be EPIC!!
FINALLY godzilla uses his pulse without thermo apgrades
2:14 y'all familiar with this statue
ME: warner brothers are playing with Kong and Godzilla
With how Monarch set up Axis Mundi as a place that has a faster passage of time, I wonder how they’ll work that in
Kong teaming up with Tony Stark
Godzilla and Kong "sprinting" will never not be funny.
Bro, was that a frost Godzilla
Glad Skar King isn't a solo villain. Because frankly, after Godzilla put Kong in the forever box last movie, no way I could take "big monke" seriously as a threat that somehow needed Godzilla and Kong to beat.
Wow kong versus skar King🔥
Godzilla goes Super Saiyan Rose, Kong now has the infinity gauntlet and they're fighting an ape who looks like Kratos. Movie's gonna be goated
This trailer is amazing I love it!
At 2:27 you can see shimu's face on the rigth
lets gooo baby 🔥
Is me have only this theory Is that Eye Is shimu's eye?
The screaming in this trailer remnnds me havy too moistcriticals meme "Whooooooooo" .. too funny
Why was zilla so tuff and he wasn’t even the main focus💀
cool
Facts 🔥🔥🔥
dino Mania has a picture of godzilla fighting shimo and kong fighting scar king
Ay yo this new planet of the apes movie looks great!
2:43 his gauntlet reminds me of yang from rwby and the way it synced with his hand the sounds reminds me of the transformers sound that the dead space 2 & 3 helmet animation
Every trailer lately has had the obnoxious drums pounding and it's getting played out. Like "please get excited for this movie!"
Is that Shimo 1:54?
That was the thing shooting a beam at Kong?
very many awesome sauce
It’s space Godzilla, calling it now
At this rate we gonna see optimus prime in the end credit lol - And if you watched the last transformer movie (GI Joe). Multiverse battle of King Kong Godzilla Transformers and GI Joe
Садамия непонятная,хрень одним словом
Wtf
YE YE YE YE YE YEEEEEEE
Godzilla vs Kong: Dawn of Justice
Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be EPiC!!
So which one gonna be release first? This one or the Minus one?
There's 2 Godzilla?!!??
🔥🔥🔥
I really do know from this trailer that Godzilla will have far more screen time than what we were told he would have
0:31 idk if yall saw but it looks like king kong vs scar king and godzilla vs another kaiju (probaly shimu)
I’m convinced that Godzilla’s new look is inspired by the 2000/millennium design with purplish spines!
bad cgi.
I like this new  Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes trailer.
I’m still in shock this is coming out on my birthday lol
was that shimu?
This movie looks so bloody good cant wait
spoiled
This is so stupid. Just like fast and the furious
Loved the 2014 Godzilla, sequel and Skull island.  Godzilla v Kong was absolutely diabolical, the monarch series was incredibly boring and this looks like the worst one yet.  The saying “it’s goes from bad to worse“, really fits this particular franchise.  It’s disappointing and a shame.
Epic Im excited to see the full reveal of shimo if there is a trailer 3 Honestly the blue eyes and ice breath is amazing  Great job
This looks epic! Wished Pacific Rim had a sequel as well.
Looks good 👍 Now add Superman next time 😮
What a time to be a Godzilla fan
Peak.
Long Live the Kings and the Deities
How qucik is goji center making this
Universal try not to make Godzilla look like a bully and kong an underdog challenge (impossible)
OK I getting a little excited for this movie
Yeah, we were blessed with Godzilla Minus One
2:18  The rematch will go hard
I didn't think it was possible, but FFS this looks worse than the last 💩 movie. Minus One was great.
Wow
Goddam this looks so stupid and awesome!!!!
Goku and Totk Link meet up to stop the sniper monkeys
No MBB makes me happy
The ones who live better
This trailer makes you wonder. Is it a godzilla trailer, or a kong trailer? None. It's a godzilla x kong trailer
I liked how the Mimi kong threw a brick at scar king 's head I laughed
I've watched the trailer over 100 times, and the "he won't be alone. " line gets me in the feels everytime!!
This is what PEAK looks like
CG looks better in this trailer, anyway! Waiting for March 29!
THIS MOVIE BOUT TO BE FIRE TRUST ME
Wait is there going to be 2 Godzillas?? Or is it just one and he’s pink AND blue in the movie
If you pause it at half a second after 0:31 you can see Godzilla fighting shimo and kong fighting scar king
they showed us the whole movie😭😭
Why bother going to see the movie when the trailer spoils 99% of it to begin with.
I feel like this is Fast & the Furious.. Original Godzilla started off nice and simple, and this is just nuts.
Increíble 😮
Looks Like Godzilla Have So Much Forms In This Movie And This Will Be Epic.
NUMBER 1 ON TRENDING
Why do I on several occasions hear Penguinz0 go “WOOOOOOO” in the background lol (At 1:14, 1:27, and 2:33)
Lovecraft would be disappointed by the amount of unnecessary human dialogue and presence in this movie.. no need, everyone just wants to see a big lizard and a big monkey fight it out..
ive never seen kong look so scared looking at "shimu"
I’ll be honest, this looks really stupid. Maybe kids will enjoy this more
2014 - let them fight 2019 - we join the fight 2021 - make em fight 2024 - make a tag team and let them fight
Am I the only one who thinks this looks bad???
What a thunder Godzilla :/
I'm going to love this, all I need to do now is invent a time machine and go back to when I was 7!
I really appreciate Godzilla taking the Anti-Hero role in the last two Monsterverse movies. After the Oxygen Destroyer, he's done with humanity's BS.  Also: nuclear pulse :pog:
this def gon cook 💀🙏🙏🔥🔥
This is so awsome it makes me wanna cry
But almost NONE take steps to embody the vision... And it is SCARRY 4 @ll. Arabs pet Lions to TAME& FEDD that ...!
This movie looks like it's going to go crazy with the action! I LOVE IT!
not the pyramids🤧
2:27 My guy's punch look like that customer from the drive thru💀
Mother Mothra is coming
Bro them running together is so cool. This all feels like a anime 😂
So apparently Godzilla gets a lightning Power up and then after a lost battle or something he uses his Naturell God(zilla) Ki to become Super Saiyan Rosé Godzilla
This is awesome!
I could rewatch this trailer all day and I might just do it
Damn godzilla blue thermonuclear that sick also shimo looks nice
#godzillaxkong #lesson #slow #modified
Ehhhh
Its cool to see Godzilla having his glowing blue form and finally A NUCLEAR PULSE!!!. THIS TRAILER IS SO AWESOME I WANT TO WatcH THE MOVIE NOW
RIP to the camel actors, they were indeed harmed during recording 🐪
of course brazil is targetted 💀
Minus One 1000x better than this fast food trash.
can i get 10 k likes?
Shimu is here
ps3 and ps4 level
We getting Kong, Godzilla (multiple forms), shims, scar king, and Mothra, based on this trailer. And thats all we know about as of now! This movie is gonna be so hype!
It’s like hulk vs Thanos all over again for Kong vs the scar king .
the moment you say godzilla is afraid of something you are wrong. More bs shoved down our throats with charters we don't care about.
I wanted to see Titanus Doug.
Well yeah.. you’re deaf 👀
This looks so familiar, is this what it looks like with an open boarder policy. Monkeys and animals.
remember the good old times when Godzilla (2014) was a pretty serious and intense movie? Or do you remember Kong Skull island - the lighthearted and action packed movie? Apparently WB forgot..
I'm insulted. Those two are not afraid of anything!
Just looks so ridiculous. I miss the Gareth Edwards 2014 grounded style
This looks really stupid.....shut up and take my money! 😂
Seems like shimo and skar king already jumping kong lol
I love that each movie they writers are just like “let’s get hammered and crazy in that writers room.” Then we get a movie less about social commentary and more UNGA BUNGA
Who else is ready to see Godzilla and Kong team-up against Scar King?! THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GOOD!!
This is going to be the best movie of the year
If you put it to the .25 slow speed at 31 seconds you see Godzilla vs Shimo and Kong vs Skar King.   Edit: You have to pause it perfectly to see it because of the cutscenes going fast.
I have no words this is just…….amazing this is a masterpiece
I hope Kong gets electric powers organically in the newer additions to the monster verse but the b.e.a.s.t glove is pretty cool
WoW! I'm Impressed!
If kong and godzilla don't have a serious makeout session in this movie itll be a waste of time.
Fckin peak
on screen this boutta be crazy!!
1:58 looks like an ice breath
dogs i cant wait woof wofffff
"they don't have to like each other. They just have to work together" real honestly
Kong The Conqueror #TeamKong
MOTHRA IS 100% GOING TO BE IN THE MOVIE
Kong hit skare with a mean punch that broke is tooth out
Kong went full Sly in Expendables knuckle duster mode eyyyy
thermonuclear in blue color!?!?! Bro this is insane!!
I love how they’re teasing Shimo but aren’t at the same time
It looks AMAZING
Could Shimo be controlling Skar King?
YEAHHHH
I’ve got no clue where this franchise is going now. Nothing will top ghidorah acting like the antichrist
2:27
Hi
Godzilla: For thousands of years I lay dormant. Who has disturbed my- Kong : Hey best buddy! Godzilla: Oh it’s you!!
Lol I like how the humans think they're gonna help lmao
Looks more interesting than the first trailer and we might be seeing the white and blue Kailua judging by some of the ice stuff and I doubt that lanky mf gonna be the true big bad
I've been a Godzillia fan since the 70s and I gotta say,I'm not feeling this one
Godzilla and Kong vs Mojo Jojo
Daniel Jaek
this looks HORRIBLE... i'll still go and see it... haha!
Godzilla can use nuclear pulse without going thermo now huh? That's sick asf, really remind ne back of Heisei.
So much autism
This is looking better and better! Goosebumps every time I see Godzilla and Shimo
The Legends have returned.
If i say my mind, ill probably be red flaged😂😂😂.
I love how Godzilla has the heisei ability.
Shimo is cool!  But I hope they gain the rights to include more Toho Monsters!
what is this ENDGAME
Someone is running out of ideas.
The Trailer is just🤩
💩 x 💩
trash
0:30 Mothra??
Can't wait to see this movie.
What paramount failed to achieve with their monster universe. Looks good.
Omg so it is true that shimu will be in the movie
What the F Minus 1
This movie is gonna be a guaranteed masterpiece if Godzilla does his dropkick!!
After watching *Godzilla Minus One* this looks ridiculous, and not in the good way...
Godzilla/kaiju fans eatinggg, Toho with Godzilla minus one and Legendary with Godzilla x kong universe 🔥🔥 what a time to be alive for godzilla/kong/kaiju fans
Did Kong knock out Scar King's tooth?
the suit grows stronger
Hear me out what if they gave kk a gun 😂😂😂
so are they fighting pink godzilla or orange kong
This is the best thing.
Iam so excited but where is mothra
They’ve gotten so much taller since then 😭 Also WE GOT SHHIIIIIMMMMMUUUUUUU😆😆!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yup, this is gonna be goood~
Well the scar king is zod of this movie
literally f..kin epic awsome this is the next big film cant wait
This is just not a movie it’s Emotion of million Fans! This gonna be the best monster movie ever! ❤❤❤Shimo-Suko-Skar-Godzilla-Kong❤❤❤
🎉
Is that Charlie screaming in the trailer?
Looks absolutely insane. Awesome trailer!
2:33 i heard that scream somewhere before...
2:13 in the frost land it looks like shimo is doing his atomic breath in the sky
Don't get it twisted - Zilla is the King.
I like how they brought back the atomic pulse for Godzilla
I'm calling it Godzilla & Kong. I don't care what anyone says.
At exactly 0:31 you can see Godzilla fighting Shimo in the background!!
Looks proper kak
Who made this trailer 🔥🔥🔥?
This is gonna be insane
The only thing that would make this trailer better from what we know in the movie is doug
Wow!
damn w trailer better then 1 one now u can see the 2 villian
It's funny to see this franchise that started as a gritty reboot, become as dumb and campy as the OG films
What is wrong with you? Because of you people, all the movies are bad now. There are only trash movies. It is all your fault, because you like this trash.
This is the one series where I don't even care if it's a bad movie, I just want to see big monsters!!
WOAH WOAH WOAH
If you guys see very closely at Kong punch scar king you can see shimu In the background
All i can say after seeing that is OMFG
I can't wait for the next movie where they'll finally show us the real enemy: Donkey Kong
That was a mean punch from king 😂
I CALL DIBS ON THAT BLUE GODZILLA BEING ATOMIC THERMONEUCLEAR GODZILLA
WTH! I would skip this one & watch 'Godzilla Minus One'.
So Godzilla got hit with the chroma key tool and Kong got the Infinity Gauntlet. Can’t wait for the next movie where Godzilla goes full RGB gaming setup and Kong gets a full hulk buster suit
DUUUUDEEEEEEE
Godzilla radioactive powers is too much it’s all over his body
The last chapter for Planet of the Apes looks great!
Main women actor should have long hair..
It's almost like watching Fast& Furious Hobbs and Shaw,  Next is Space Baby   Aliens from Space
I Was really looking forward to see some of the characters from Godzilla King of Monsters or Monarch legacy of monsters, although it would be 7 years difference (2017 - 2024) till where both the movie and series ended respectively in the monsterverse timeline, but it would be really iconic if they could have shown Keiko or travelled to rescue Lee Shaw in hollow earth. They haven't even showed us the fate of some characters of Godzilla King of Monsters line the twins Dr. Illene Chen and Dr.Ling Chen. 😢 I just wish they can cast all the other monsterverse project characters in one movie.
Kong’s face at 1:52 had him realizing he’a about to find out what’s it like to chew 5 mint gum
Looks dumb. Im in.
they both fear it ? GODZILLA DOESN'T KNOW FEAR. He is the KRATOS of Monsterverse. #KingOfTheMonsters . WB is turning into Marvel, killing character development on the sake of hype
screaming! cant wait!
2/10
This trailer was incredible! 🔥 Nice to see Kong getting the upgrade (Infinity gauntlet). I am crazy hyped for this movie!
Godzilla did the Nuclear Pulse! The same one he used to kill King Ghidora but it seems like he knows how to control it now!
Godzilla seems to be super saiyan Rose this time!!
Epic And i like that Kong's glove and Godzilla's pink glow
Can't wait 😮
This montage of pure epic art took me by surprise and I don’t think I’ll be ready for how sick this is gonna be
so we are watching pacific rim now or what
This looks terrible...but also fun 😂
I wonder if Shimo and Scar King are working together
You know, if you make the next trailer, you need to put Shumo, Mothra, and Fosphera.
Thankfully no MIllie Bobby Brown.
aj ka din acha rha ,, 3 3 trailer.. deadpool , planet of aps and now godzilla..
we actually see legendary g do a atomic pulse
This is peak.
Looks like Godzilla is a minor side character in his own movie. And great, more apes...
Where is the villain?
This will be fire 🔥
Mmm… Monkey.
Does this link worh the apple tv show?
Pls make Godzilla red ghost pls at the end of the movie
Oh yea babbbbbbbby
I was hoping the Pacific Rim`s Jaegers to appear. That would be epic. Ok, maybe next time. Both kong and pacific rim are Warner`s franchises so this is possible
2:27 A blurry reveal of Shimo. (To the right)
SHIMO
I’m about to explode
Let me give you a tip.  If you set the playback speed to 0.25x, you will be able to notice all the details. I would like it.
Shimooooo
Monsterverse is going full showa-era, balls-to-the-wall mayhem and I LOVE IT!! It is easily one of my favorite series of the franchise, and I can’t wait to see (what I’m assuming to be) its culmination!
this has got to be one of the best or second best movie trailers i have ever seen
Nossa eu fiquei coringando igual uma estudante japonesa
This appears looks and seems to be probably The Best Most Epic Kaiju Movie of All Time and hopefully I will be Standing in Line to Watch it in The Movie  Theater
most violent punch of all time
Okay the scar king is like zod .
For EVERYONE CONFUSED AND CONCERNED About How Godzilla can stand above water and then go into deep depths, NO WAY YOU'RE THIS STUPID. You might as well be asking humans " How are you able to float above water " IDK IF YOU LIVE WITH PATRICK UNDER HIS ROCK, BUT HE USES HIS TAIL AND FEET TO STAY ABOVE WATER. He may not have alot of strength during that, BUT WHEN HE ATTACKED KONG ON THE SHIP IN GODZILLA VS KONG, HE WASN'T STANDING ABOVE WATER, HE LUNGED THROUGH THE WATER AND USES HIS VELOCITY TO THEN ATTACK OUT OF THE WATER. GODZILLA IS BASED OFF MULTIPLE ANIMALS. NOT ONE. So just like us humans are able to FLOAT Above Water, Godzilla is WAYYYYYYYYYY Stronger than us, And it shouldn't be ANY Surprise to how he's able to do that. You also gonna ask how a DOLPHIN CAN STAY ABOVE WATER AS WELL?! STRAIGHT DUMBASSES 🗣️🤷💯
Best trailer ever totally going to see it
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS TRAILER
0:30.🦋???
This will be the movie of the year
No need for more apes.
Who let Sly Marbo constantly interrupt?
niemand kann Godzilla was
Godzilla looks like he lost half his body weight.
Bring me back the 2014 Godzilla🙁
Now tell as this cost 500 mil...
Shimo at 0:31? Put the video on 0.25x speed it's very quick. Shimo fighting glowing pink godzilla on the right
Awesome ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The only thing this trailer was missing is Dom driving by saying family
Man this movie is gonna be crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
SHIMU
So kong is Thanos Now😅 and godzilla has a barbie Form💀 : bruh just kidding i think godzilla has pink crystal on hes Back now
Right because Kong needs a power fist tell me another one lazy Hollywood riders and you wonder why Godzilla minus 1 is cleaning the house.
0:31 brooooo, shimu vs godzilla and kong vs skar
This looks dumb as a stump and I can’t wait to see it!
2:27 that puch was brutal💀
Someone needs to replace the audio when kong gets his new fancy glove to the audio from the bionic arm meme video
they gotta take it easy with cgi
So whose the bad guy? A red gorilla?? Seems silly
This has some of the best graphics I've ever seen in a game!
This looks dumb as a stump and I can’t wait to see it!
LET'S GOOOO!!!
This is the build up for Mecha Kong I swear.
WHY HAVE YALL NOT MADE A VIDEO GAME YET?!?!? WHERE IS GODZILLA DESTROY ALL MONSTERS?!?!?
Looks stupid. I’ll wait for the next Toho Godzilla.
shimu is surprise ?
that shot of Godzilla blasting his new atomic breath is insane
Beastwars meets thanos
This looks so good can’t wait we need this movie, the world needs it
MANOO QUE DAORAAAA !!!
"Something there're both afraid of" she better mean shimu cause godzilla already killed ghidorah
My mom passed away the other day. This trailer managed to bring a smile to my face. Can’t wait for this banger!!
Oh my god, sorry this look terrible. Hollywood Godzilla, planet of Apes I said only ones: Godzilla Minus One
ok that looks pretty badass
So much great Godzilla content these days!
half a decade later... mothra is still nowhere near to be seen
Welp, this is awesome.
Kong fighting skar is tight 😮
This bouta be epic
Godzilla and Kong getting upgrades! THIS WILL BE EPIC‼️‼️
OMG THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD
Family!
Woo wee! im excited for this one! well now we know that Kong and Bad Ape are roughly the same size.
😮😮😮
Ok wow! I honestly didn’t like the first trailer much but this looks really epic!
lmao at 1:26 it sounds like moistcritikal screaming WOOO but pitched lower
I think there are 2 Godzillas
Wow shimo
simo is comming ❤
Wowo❤
Godzilla and Kong vs scar king and shoum
😮😮😮😮
Kong slammed that tooth right out his face 😂
I cant wait
YOU F*CKING SEE THIS @ScreenCultureOfficial THIS A REAL TRAILER!🤓
any shimo tagline?
This trailer gave me goosebumps
This actually looks good, glad they brought uncle ruckus and saw Godzilla minus one
New Doomfist buffs look insane
This looks so corny
só o primeiro titã pra conseguir esfriar o rio de janeiro
Godzilla fans eating good this year 👌
💪🏾🤴🏾💯💪🏾🤴🏾💯💪🏾🤴🏾💯💪🏾🤴🏾💯
This has strong made for chinese market transformers or MEG style cash grab vibes. And just like in Pacific Rim 2 all sense of scale is completly lost. When kong was fighting that other ape it could have been from the new planet of the apes movie and noone would know how giant those creatures are.
It looks like Kong could physically handle the Scar King.. Homie seems to be more like Professor James Moriarty.
Fisto Kong!!
THIS IS AMAZING
of course I'll be listening to ACT 2 on my way to watch Godzilla & Kong  🎉🎉🎉
1:24 mothra's egg?? 😮
OMG! MOTHRA IS BACK...and THAT FIGHT SCENE WITH KONG v. SKAR and GODZILLA v. SHIMU. ALL OF THIS E-PIC-NESSSSS!
FROSTBITE GODZILLA OR MAYBE THE MAMMOTH ONE
this looks atrocious 😭 yall really ruined the beautiful version of this world gareth Edwards created
I just want to say that these movies are super cool and the feeling I get from watching Godzilla in all of its glory alongside Kong in all of its glory is simply amazing.
you anyways cant do better than Godzilla minus one
March 29th
man, I don´t really like the direction they choose since G vs K still hyped tho
Shimo is the biggest Titan revealed so far. If the rumors are true he is almost 2 times the size of godzilla.
Lo admito, me manosee viendo esto
I’m excited, but also worried at how much this looks like a transformers trailer
GODZILLA should let Kong get greased and then destroy the red monkey and shimo on his own lol.  Its like they make Godzilla lose some lime light in these movies now...
Thunder Vs Gaunlet
I was so disappointed in Godzilla vs Kong. They took a cool concept and utterly butchered it. Based on the trailer looks like their gonna do it again.
We’re just doin Godzilla/Kong buddy cop movies now huh
BRO EVERYTIME RIO SHOWS UP IN KAIJUVERSE ITS JUST CAOS
After watching it three times, I was still screaming the same way. That's how awesome this movie is going to be. I don't want to wait anymore  Ahhhhh 😫
😭
I think I just got hard and wet at the same time…
Now i see a godzilla that can run and move like butter😂 rather than lazy old godzilla from previous movies😅
Really glad Godzilla x Kong is real this Valentine’s Day
I wonder when it's going to come out
this movie will be taking over the theatres. i can't believe legendary is making this much of a masterpiece for us. i am going to watch this movie everyday
kaiju universe is gone. but at least we are getting this 🙏
0:30 mothra is in the girl's eyes WE GOT MOTHRA BACK BOYS
They seem as if they are mixing to many different happenings together. Shin Godzilla and Minus One showed us how to keep it simple and make it great. Let's see how this one plays out.
@2:38 I have a feeling that this is Mothra ❤️  😍🦋
BRAZILLLLLLL
This gonna lick balls
Yeaaaah we got Godzilla vs Kong 2 let's gooo
Who will win in the match between godzilla and kong?
Godzilla don't need no partner
Yes folks. Take my money now!😂😂😂
where’s our boy doug
Ah this movie is going to be great.
I hope that it is not woke!
My kong theory was right I feel so happy
Go Godzilla and Kong
Shimu 🔥🔥
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Heavy.
Wow just wow.
Warner Bros keep up the good work! I love the new footage!
Kong destroyed my house donate 5$ so I can rebuild venmo @goodnitehero ❤😂
The fact that Godzilla can do a pulse without thermo is crazy i can't wait till the movie came out!
We need the movie The world needs it
Cool that the Skar King is an evil version of Kong. And now we have an evil version of Godzilla too!  Also I love that he uses the Spine Bone of a Titan as a Flail
I still say Godzilla is purple not pink, but it also makes sense why he would attack Kong again. Seeing an army of Titan apes Godzilla would think Kong would be on their side.
ART!
Where’s Shimo 😢
Lol, Godzilla is afraid? He was battling King Ghidorah and Mechagodzilla.
"We've made some augumentations" ..."Oh?"... Ive never came so hard in my pants seeing the guanlet on Kong..
The Legendary Godzilla is officially dead. It always sucked but it’s gone forever now. No more good can come from it. The straw that broke the camel’s back was airing Godzilla running
Where is Doug 😢
This is sick!
Undertaker and Kane vibes. The Brothers of Destruction.
Awesome so it was true that with ice breath is the villian of the movie Godzilla and Kong New Empire
It will be a great honor for Rio de Janeiro to participate in this great film 🙂
Nah this movie and kung fu panda 4 is all I need of 2024
We finally get to see shimu in action
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSS!!!!!
I’m Waiting Collaboration With Pubg+Bgmi X GODZILLA X KONG😁😁🔥🔥
This film looks action packed and more kaiju then human interactions!! Can’t wait!!
Kong gets upgraded made by man and godzilla get learn a new super power charge up yep best beat down coming soon
A signal was felt, again. There is an even bigger threat, again.
if you stop at 0:31 you can see scar king blowing the surfce and sending baby kong flying while full pink godzilla fights shimu
Can’t wait for this always look for ward to Godzilla movie except for shin Godzilla I didn’t like that one boring humans glad deaf girl is back like her
I'm so excited for this movie
Godzillas new atomic explosion sounds better/wierd and he looks weaker thsn his old one
whos the one wit the glowing eyes behind the lava?
Caralho mano que trailer foi esse fiquei sem reação real aqui 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Oh yeah, HERE WE GO!!!!!!
I wish I'm rich enough to see this🥲
Warner oficialmente te amo. Gracias por este regalo del día de la amistad!
🤢🤢🤢
I had low hopes for this movie but now I don't even have to watch it this is going to be the best movie in human history I don't care what anyone says it already is
I just need to see them drop a trailer with the infinity stones
And Adam wingard he's made the best monster film ever this is going to be epic
Godzilla was taking class from Goku black it seems 😂
Looks awesome. But I feel like they're making them too big and powerful with the constant recent evolutions. They keep increasing like this, the next movie their fart is gonna blow a hole in the side of the earth.
BRAAASILLLLLLL 🦍X🐊
So Godzilla has gone Breast Cancer Awareness Color, does it wear the Pink Ribbon too?
SHIMOOOO
As a fan of Godzilla Minus one, I must say this:   I like both. May the Kaiju genre thrive all around the world.
The cgi ain’t it to me yet some scenes aren’t that good well hope the movies still great
Bro they really gotta get King Kong and super sayian Godzilla to defeat scar king
This kinda looks garbage and i just want to see if anyone agrees, there is nothing wrong if you do like it, but im just tired of seeing these cgi extravaganzas nowadays
Can’t f$);(? Wait
I Was Here! 2,173,108 views
Maybe Kong will gain even Skar King's respect. Happy 90 years to our boy! *Go Kong!!! Dethrone him! You rule!* 👑 🦍
Kong and Godzilla working together but people nowadays don’t get a long 😂😂😂😂
Agendado!!!
The CGI looks damn good right now
1:50
Sky beams? Again?
I don't think I'll ever get tired of seeing Godzilla and Kong bust heads on the big screen.
got that feeling of “ I am Iron Kong “ vibes
2:13 shimmoo fireng ice to the portal
I can't wait to see more of Evolved Godzilla. He looks so badass in this movie
This looks visually awful, and incredibly stupid.
So pumped hurry up time
THIS TRAILER LOOKS AMAZING!!!!!
Never in my life when I would say I love this franchise, every movie blows my mind every single time & I can't wait til this gets released
the final battle in Rio de Janeiro, that's really cool
Can't wait for this movie
So pumped hurry up time
I'm hyped
BRO, THERE IS LITERALLY 3 GODZILLAS, WATCH IT IN 0.25X SPEED. THE ONE THAT DID THE ATOMIC PULSE (BLUE ONE), SUPER SAYIAN ROSE ONE (the pink one, obviously) AND THE FREEZING ONE. WTF IS GONNA HAPPEN IN THE MOVIE. Edit: i also saw a very long and thin at the end tusk, im guessing that is behemoth Edit 2: I just realized the "freezing godzilla" is just the shimo titan
Godzilla: KONG! LOOK OUT! IT’S- *Kong’s big massive monkey king head falls to the floor* Megatron: let’s take em down Opti-poo Optimus: Rada Rada 😎
Basically a monster verse buddy cop movie and I’m here for it
But where is my girl Mothra? Isn't that girl from the tribe that guards mothra
Just like Jeff Goldblum said in JP “That’s one big pile of shi$!”
Best movie already of the year
They back for round 2 .
Omg❤
Wooooow
Yeah, don't create story. It's like bring everything together and mix everything and just create a mess, just to save the world.
Reptilians and Black peoples rise up… smh these elites are funny af
a
Finaly we got a glimpse of Shimo, which i am so excited to look in a battle🤩🤩😁 And i think the battles in this movie is finally Kong vs Skar King and godzilla vs Shimo🤩💙  Today its my birthday, i got a lot of other gifts, but this is the best gift I have got on my birthday Ever🥳🤩  This trailer was SO EXTREMELY AMAZING🤩🤩 THANKS FOR THIS SUPER DUPER TRAILER🤩🤩🤩🤩❤❤💙💙
Damnnn
2:53 MARTHA!!!! ERR, I MEAN MOTHRA!!!! xD
a
At 0:30 you can see Shimo for like a millisecond
This movie looks ridiculous and I'm totally down for it.
Shimu looks powerful, also gawdamn we got supercharged Godzilla for the first time
This looks insane im not going to lie
Godzilla X Kong in space in 2026 I’m excited 🔥🔥
Kong. Broke.   Skar king.  Tooth
why they still gotta be fighting bro 💀
Some of THE best CGI work 🔥🔥🔥
This looks so stupid.
March 29 - LFG
2:28 WHY THE TOOTH HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This movie is going to be the best movie of the year and the best movie in the monsterverse they have my boy Godzilla king of the monsters and surface in he's new evolved crystal magenta form and my boy Kong or King Kong with his beast gauntlet and his axe also I love to see the Godzilla vs Kong cast back in action again
Cena do Kong e Gozilla juntos arrepiou tudo
People who saw scar king Godzilla and shimo 👇
No Dark 🌑
GMan's gonna pulse again! Tho kinda funny they did How to Train ur Dragon thing like the Dragons(Great Apes & Skar) serving the Red Death(Shimu) or thats separate scenes?
sensacional
I can't wait to see memes about Super Saiyan Rose Godzilla and Infinity Gauntlet Kong 🍿🍿🍿🍿
Kong just knocked out skar kings tooth
Ooof this looks worse than the last one.
Now we all know that who is real villain 🔥🔥🔥
That’s the most is lads
meh
this duo can beat anyone
So much better than trailer 1
Lizard man and Monkey Boy
The blue likening thermo nuclear Godzilla has electrical powers?!
Okay so kong was whoopin that mfer so he brings out shimu bet, and Kong looked relatively the same size and a lot more muscle than skar
Bro everytime I start one of these kaiju trailers it's “KONG CAN FEEL IT COMING, SOMETHINGS COMING, GODZILLA KNOWS SOMETHING IS COMING,”
Now that’s some adrenaline 🥵
2:27 Shimo's head and tail   Head tail 😂
Im waitng for thia maaan🤞❤️
🤣
We need Kong and Godzilla, the world needs them. To stop what's coming.
Maybe the axe that Kong got from that skull was a mamber of Shimu species.
I think they did it... Found a sure fire way to mess up the Kong/ Godzilla franchises.
Pause 0:30 was that mothra in her eyes?!? Pause 0:31 godzilla was fighting shimu he looks huge!!
A tooth is DNA
Epic Last dance of MonsterVerse ❤️🖤🔥
SICK.
Gdzolla is very small now. But the scene where tehy run next to each other I thought. Wow, what a  pice of shiet
This is cinema
I like that we get to see Godzilla's iconic blue back again
Chat , this is gonna be epic
So stupid
Was that mothra’s egg at 1:25???!
whatever ....my favorite is godzilla since my childhood ❤
Gonna be the best movie of 2024🔥
Good news: This movie looks fire  Bad news: I pooped my pants out of excitement, and have no one to change my diaper. Anyone want to?
Epicness on its peak FANTASTIC
All i wanna know is are we getting the Godzilla Drop Kick???
2:19 I bet Godzilla gonna train Kong.
SUKO OMG
I liked the Charlie White scream at 2:33 Nice touch.
It's Not A Godzilla x Kong, it's PURE GOOSEBUMPS!!
This is a film to enjoy.
godzilla has super sayan blue and rose form now
Man this looks amazing Godzilla and Kong team up 👏👏⚡❤️💯. That's what I talking about so excited
SO MUCH HYPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We need a crossover with Vin Diesel in here, ludacris can have some lines too 😂😂😂
Doomfist
Saw the first King when I was 8 .
Looks like 💩
yes!
This started as monkey vs lizard and now is world war kaiju
0:29 Did she have a vision of Mothra? (slow the video speed and it looks like Mothra's face reflected in her eye.
I don't even care if the acting is good. Give me titans duking it out on the big screen. Take my money...just kidding, I've got gift cards.
This looks terrible but I’m gone watch it
Godzilla entering super saiyan, while Kong having a power gauntlet is something I never thought I would see
0:30 You can see Mothra through Jia's Eyes, Check with 0.25X
People that are excited  👇
Godzilla X Kong? Wow they're gonna kiss aren't they.
They made Godzilla anorexic… wtf
Pradeep Loves Anusha Madhamanchi Reddy palem bhadrachalam IBM for ever
Who whatches this sheit?..... you can also just rewatch a good movie, godzilla minus one maybe
Pacific rim 3? will have?
This franchise is kind of like the new modern Shōwa era of Godzilla isn’t it? It started off fairly dark and down to Earth, and has become more bombastic with each new entry.
So did anyone peep how in 2:27 when Kong punches Skar King Skar is also holding baby kong!!!??!?
Id rather see rubber suits and miniatures this stuff looks so digital and videogame like....
"Smtn even their afraid of gave me goosebumps"
1:50 I think Kong is not afraid of Shimo, he's shocked after seeing so many of his kind
👍👍👍
Wait so is this kong and Godzilla vs Evil Kong and Godzilla ?
Shimu looks ****ing insane!!
So scar is not the king on the Halo earth he was some kind of commander the real king is is that ice Kaiju I think?
WHERES MOTHRA?!?
Still surprised Nick Fury hasn't spoke to these two 😂😂
Why is godzilla an electric pokemon 😭      Looks good though
I billion dollars club first monster universe movie confirm.. Summer we are enjoyed  in theaters.. 🔥💥👌
Looks bad.   Lmao. Maybe I'll catch it on red box
oof it's still all just fight scenes and unimportant characters we don't care about
Ahhhhh Yes finally a lanky villain. You love to see it for the respect of us lanky people! 🫡
2:33-2:34 Did I just saw something or my blind eyes that Godzilla using that same ability that Thermo Godzilla use that same one on Ghidorah? Thats savage, bro!!!!
I am surely going to watch this amazing movie after my 12th board exams 🩷
So basically kong got a frostbite on his right hand
That looks crazy I’m not sure if I’ll be seeing that but since I saw Godzilla vs kong just maybe
I have seen this trailer around 10 times I can't stand the excitement of going to see the movie on its opening day in the cinema
Espectacular 😮🔥
THIS IS THE COOLEST THING EVER
This is getting cringe guys 😮
Two blockbuster movies in the same year with factions of warring apes?  I’ll tell you which one’ll do better at the box office and it won’t be this one.
Well this movie is not going to break hollywoods winning streak lol. 😂
Godzilla x kong the new empire trailer 3 coming soon 😊
shimo is in the movie?! and now scar king is flipped off
Man, this trailer is so long that i don´t even need to watch the movie anymore 🤣
wow avengers woke looks awesome.
Confirm hai bhai confirm hai bhai zimo hai ❤❤
😮
Kong party 😊😊
I have a feeling the orange ape isn't the main monster. I think something even bigger and stronger will come up and him Kong and Godzilla team up to stop it.
THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE EPIC!
Never thought I'd see a movie where Kong & Godzilla fight side-by-side.  This is going to be great!!!
Goku and Vegeta Finally teaming up!
they are overdoing it, is vfx that cheap?
2:27 shimo face behind scar king bruh..
Somebody has to answer for that sequence of Kong and Godzilla running together.
enough with the stupid human characters, especially that dumb kid👎🏻 we want monster fights not spoiled brats.
Doomfist....
Okay.... now it's ridiculous.
Yeah boi super saiyan rosei g man and infinity gauntlet kong its gonna be crazy🔥🔥🔥🔥
I didn't think we would get two Planet of the Apes film this year.
God dam godzilla is like thermo but blue
HOL UP LOOK AT 1:25 I THINK THATS A MOTHRA EGG AND IN ONE SCENE YOU CAN SEE SHIMU
Mothra is back!
Freaking cool I wish you showed shimo bosy
😂 this is so cliched Hollywood… running out of ideas eh
I see where goku black got that pink inspiration from.
2:27 Kong has been learning some moves.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Does anyone know if this movie will play on a 4DX ???
looks stupid
0:31 you can literally see Godzilla  fighting Shimon for a split second and Kong fighting skar king pure goosebumps🔥
There's never been a better time to be a Godzilla fan. Its like having the Showa and Heisei era happening simultaneously with the action packed American movies and the serious Japanese ones. There's something to love for everyone❤❤❤
Aren't you tired of the joking black guy cliché?
Even after the gauntlet kong still knocks out  scar kings tooth without using it 🤦🏽
Wow seeing shimo with ice breath freeze kongs axe wascepic they made a good job concealing his identity but the trailer looks lit 🔥looks like its gonna some frozen battle the next ice age the hype is real.
P lease
Got the Avengers team up mixed with anime power ups and mythical weapons.
Мои любимки
Great apes? Godzilla rosé? This is just DBZ with more giant monsters.
Woohoooo
I just hope mothra returns
Rodan is dead
Alternate Title: Kong hires Godzilla as a hitman
So much more info wow
LET’S GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Trailer 2 Is Amazing 🤩 Guys You Know I See Shimo In This Trailer 2 😮Did You Guys Notice It Or Not 😮 It Will Be Amazing Experience To See Two Villain In This Movie One Scar Kind And Second Shimo 😮😮
Thank god no Millie Bobby Brown. She was awful in the last film
So godzilla and kong start off fighting each other come on thought they had a truce. I guess godzilla still salty about that axe in the mouth 😂
the last time I watched one, Godzilla was a robot.
No convence. Misma receta de filme anterior con otro enemigo. Ya cansa.
In waiting for da memes
Enough with humans in these movies
Antonio Inoki could beat Godzilla
Now we have seen the whole movie with the first trailer and this one smh. Godzilla minus one did good because we didnt see much of the trailer. Dear movie productions. Stop showing us the whole movie. I was looking forward to this because this trailer 😩😩😩
Just remember, Godzilla’s names first because he won .
If you looked closely when Kong punched scar king in the face scar king was holding suko. And if really pay attention you could see shimu face in the background pause at 2:27
2 million views in 3 hours, don't have to say anything about the movie, it's already epic.
Monsters together strong 💪🏾🔥💯
Gong 2. Nice
Idk how many times I've watched this now...ffs I'm erect.
I got goose bumps
I hate it
I wanna see Godzilla just start geekin out on someone like he did with kong but way way more aggressive
Omg totally goosbumps 😍😍🔥🔥🔥
We’re getting Planet of the Apes movie and a Kong movie. It’s more the year of the ape than the year of the dragon
Buuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrr. Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
godzilla is the king please u dont shift it to kong want more screen time for godzilla u build everything on it remember that teamgodzilla
The teeth of Skar 😂
That was an Epic trailer! Good Job!
Old kong and godzilla: ok ok       Godzilla x kong:yeaaaaaaaaaaa
If you stop the trailer at 30 seconds, and watch it at 0,25x speed, you can see what appears to be Mothra in jia‘s eyes. Or that is what I think.
00:30 if you play at .25x u will notice mothra's reflection in that small girl's eye 👀
Stuff is going to get real.
Thus Shimui has been confirmed
Goji fans assemble twice.  We're in for a double intimidation display treat!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Waow
Godzilla achieves Ssj rose and Kong gets an infinity gauntlet and they’re both fighting Liu from the JUNGLE BOOK. Still less ridocoulous than an Showa movie
Aliens? Please be aliens.
This. looks so dumb
❤❤❤
They should  combine living monstery and transformers.
Really looking forward for the action ❤❤❤❤
Can’t fxcking wait . Lettssss goooo
Finally Godzilla has the pulse ability
Infinity gauntlet kong pure genius
They gave Kong the Powerfist from fallout!!
Stop stop stop, just take my money!
Can't wait to watch it on the Big screen 🤩
Is there more than one Godzilla?
So, this is Fast & Furious but with giant monsters... So happy Minus One did so well in theaters.
Kong is gonna be a badass
Warner Bros, my dudes, the pyramids of Giza are in Cairo, not the middle of the desert
Oh man I CANNOT wait for this!!!!
Now THAT'S a Super-Hero movie!
This is gonna be bigggggggggg🔥
Monke🐵
YO WE ARE SO BACK!!!!
I’m watching for sure💯
The big hit when Kong punched Scar King at 2:27 was LIT! Note:put the speed 0.25 to see better of how Kong punched Scar King.
Bro, we all still need a Rodan reappearance because we all know he’s still alive
Honestly the only interest I have in this film is to see Shimo. Same terrible character acting, same far fetched story line and terrible CG for the budget. It wouldn’t be so bad if I hadn’t seen Minus One yet. My god what a movie that ‘twas
13×13=169 🔼👁️🐍👹🧞‍♂️🐐
Y’all ain’t ready for the scene where all of em are all oiled up and ready to throw it back
Lots of daytime fighting. I want to see this more than my first born child.
Godzilla afraid of something plz 😅😂
I used to enjoy the Godzilla movies back in the day when I was growing up now they’re just getting ridiculously absurd😵‍💫
Kong and Godzilla team up fight against the scar king and new titan crazy.🔥
Really looking forward to seeing this... DC and MARVEL Movies are RUBBISH!!!
Shimo looks cold
Are some of the shots unfinished?
This movie is gonna be so good who with me!!!
How on god's green earth is there a fanbase for this???
Now it seems that PUBG MOBILE is about to bring a new event 🔥🔥🔥
Me in 2015ish : now everyone’s trying to make a cinematic universe just because Marvel  is killing the game . So lame. Leave it to the pros.    Me now : I’m excited for  almost every current cinematic universe other than Marvel right now
🌕🐛🦋❤️
Meh... It does what is written on the box I guess.
How are these two, who both fought their strongest enemies afraid of a red monkey and an icicle
,,He wont be alone" gives me chills everytime
is kong going to lose a hand is that why he has a gauntlet
Why king is wearing gadgets doesent look natural
THIS LOOKS INSANE
Releasing On March 29Th
This is gonna be epic!!
Hard pass. It's bad enough that the Marvelization of movies killed the comicbook movie genre.
Shimu 🔥
MUITO BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
god zilla will always be my favorite movie
Yo, why I'm i actually excited for this, first planet of the apes and now Kong and Godzilla?  2024 is looking good so far for the primate flicks.
Godzilla and Kong running looks so incredibly stupid.
👍👍👍 so cool
Let’s go!!!!!!
shimu must be some other kind of beast. when kong fought godzilla he was ready and unafraid but when shimu shows up he looms terrified
🔥🔥🔥
This looks fantastic!!!!
HURRY UP ALREADY
Godzilla and Kong gonna beat up Lankey Kong!
I really got goosebumps just watching the trailer. The movie will definitely give me some heart attacks...🔥👊
Already Best than minus one 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
As a king kong and godzilla hugeeee fan i am really terrified how weak trailer 1 and 2 is. From terrific monster movie to that fuggin disaster for teenagers 😡
Too much epicness, after watching this I felt so lightheaded.
We all know it's behemoths battling each other and the story isn't the strongest point of these movies, but it's so much fun. Can't wait
❤❤❤
It's seems like apes are taking over 2024
2:52
Like how the first movie was a godzilla villian then sequel is pretty much a villain to kong
Icy
Where is king ghidorah
SHIMOOOOOO
Kong just became IronKong 😶
this franchise just keeps getting worse and worse. hollywood just can't help themselves, they turn every kaiju movie into worthless action schlock!
Epic🥶
Not liking the pink godzilla
2:27
This is a great Valentine’s Day gift
Godzilla and kong are officially Gods. Godzilla before evolved form, was already planetary. Now they might be LARGE planetary like Jupiter.
Ok I’m grateful now
This movie gonna be all action all I love it.
Everything is Ok but GODziLLa's ATOMiC breath is  gonna be always OP and OG ones 🔥 missing it
“Our battle will be legendary”
I am not feeling all that excited.
So excited
This is getting dumber and dumber.  Who would think of something like that, a thirteen year old?
[soundwaves warbling]
SHIMO? GODZILLA HAS A ELECTRICALNUCLEAR FORM? MONSTERVERSE INFINITY WAR?!?!?!
This was the only notification I got on valentines day. Best notification ever, thanks legendary
0:13 & 2:32 I mean...😮
The worst thing they always do is make them so fast, bro they're huge creatures they're supposed to appear slow to our pov. This is what they did to Pacific Rim Uprising, same thing they did to Godzilla vs Kong and now here, made them look like power rangers
Godzilla x Godzzila White Kong vs Kong Orange
The fea in Kongs eyes whne he sees shimu just gives me chills
Oh my god this seems childish.  All the bass drops and effects. Why bother?
this will be EPIC but nobody can't beat King Kong movie from 2005
kong knocks out Scar King's tooth and doesn't even punch him with his glove, he punches him with his left!🦍❤️🔥☄️
Kong is Op Mann And I mean literally overpowered.... bruh Overwhelmed scar king with one Hand Alone dammm.....!
Has anyone else feel like they watched the movie by watching the movie lol. I'm excited for this movie but I feel like they showed to much.
GOD THIS MOVIE LOOKS SO GOOD!!!!
Mid ....
should be named "kong the gauntlet of power " lol!!!!!!!
At first, I thought it was going to be Godzilla and KIng Kong against the Decepticons with that desert scene
They gonna be making these movies till the day the earth stops spinning 😂
Kong Gan EGWF!
D A M !!!!!!
Are they fighting Space Godzilla
Where is Kong's meat?
PlayStation exclusive game
This is how he becomes KING kong
This looks so cool
Bernie is Just one of the best Things to ever happen to me😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Whos that enemy in the shadow with blue shiny eyes and throwing ice blast on Kong ?
Godzilla and Kong running together never gets old.
This has no right being this hype! Bring in more monsters and expand the cinematic universe.
Man, they didn’t even need to reveal Shimo in full; just that scene of Kong trying to hold back it’s ice blast shows that Shimo’s _definitely_ a force to be reckoned with (and to that extent, so is Skar King)!
At first, there was Deadpool 3 1st trailer this February and now Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire 2nd trailer. However, now I can't ever wait much more for the movie.
If I have to hear one more film child say this is stupid one more time. It is stupid! It’s fun and a call back too old school showa Godzilla of the 60’s and 70’s. This type of entertainment has always been apart of Godzilla. Don’t pretend to be above of something you virtually could care less about
Seems pretty rad
Makes Godzilla minus one look tame
They should add godzilla and kong daping each other up
2:04: y’all gotta be honest, this scene goes hella hard 😎
2:13 you can see Shimo ice beaming to the sky, i wonder if hes blasting another kaiju that wasnt shown to be in the movie
Not again why do people feel the need to make their hair short in sequels! Lol
At 2:27 you can see skar king holding mini kong before kong punches him
After Godzilla Minus One this feels so cheesy
Damn it’s gonna be epic
I love the power glove....
space godzilla!!!
This trailer gave me the chills like 5 times 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😂
This is Cinema. Lets Go Babbyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lizard vs monkee
Godzilla on those steroids
Where's the drop kick? Come on!
Does anyone else miss the dark impactful semi realism like what we got with 2014 Godzilla or the new Japanese one?  I love a 100 million dollar CGI fight as much as the next guy but I do miss having semi coherent plot lines and  human characters that aren’t a complete waste of screen time.
Thanks for the gift 💝 Btw how bad is this other monkey? It looks like Godzilla can solo this guy.
Shimu OFFICIAL!!!!!
Best movie of 2024
Thats cool and all but WHERES DOUG?!?!
Godzilla & Kong: Bad Bros 4 Life
King of the Monsters set the stage for an apocalyptic setting like the new Planet of the Apes series.  It's a real shame they shifted focus to neon and hollow-Earth.
CHONKE AND MONKE 2
I hope RIZZilla would Smash Shimu 😂
godzilla isnt afraid of anything give me a break
En mi opinión creo que mostraron demás
Godzilla's scream sounds like Charlies WOOOH meme..
this just might be the best movie of the year
Running Godzilla is evil.
Kongs a real one. Won’t back down from the fight no matter how big or bad the other guy is lol.
I can't wait to watch this on my AVP.
lol
THIS... LOOKS... SO... STUPID.
This looks so 2015
Thats me seen the movie then. No need to go to the cinema. Cheers chaps!
I can’t wait for this epic movie!
t'challa get this man a new arm...
Kongs about to be chasing them stones
Remember yall, CIA has a office in Hollywood and vice versa
We really got Thanos King Kong and Goku Godzilla before GTA 6
We're in 2024 and the graphics look so fake.... come on man
It’s funny this title is called empire like ghostbusters frozen empire and same goes for Star Wars empire strikes back .
Idgaf about the human characters in this franchise...just give me the Monsters
That’s it, somebody call the research commission. It’s time to Hunt fiver.
LET’S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
IM SOOOOOOO LITTTT 😈😈
My jaw broke after see this
This time it is an Big Feast for The Audience.... But one thing I am doubt about villain Kong it is not that much strong seems to be like that let's see what will going to happen in theatres after releasing....
Then the fire nations attack….
Seems this film went to the Pacific Rim 2 school of directing and forgot that BIG stuff is HEAVY and moves SLOW.
THIS MOVIE 🎥 IS GOING TO BE EPIC! 💯💯👍🏽👍🏽✌🏽✌🏽
I was waiting for doug the entire time
2:13 shimu 🥶🥶
Why doesn’t Superman just fly them all into the vacuum of space. Problem solved.
PEAK!!!!
Though I’m all in for new stuff, I really miss the Toho monsters. Rodan is still out there, and they could easily bring in monsters Michael Dougherty recommended like Gigan and Biollante since the monsterverse is introducing more whimsical elements. Jet Jaguar also got a recommendation from the Monarch director. I know they aren’t cheap to use but the Monsterverse is making money
terribly fairy-tale, childish
Finally I always want to therm charged Godzilla let’s go
I came
Mirrrrrrr eeeee varshammm 🔥
Epic goosebumps
God the CGI looks horrible. Still think the ‘98 Godzilla was the best.
this is absolutely ridiculous 😂
Size of shimu is so biggg so that even skar king looks small 2:13
Honestly, I’m quite sad that we didn’t see shimo but hey at least we saw SUKO with a rock hitting a Kong with it I loved the part that Kong hit scar king with he’s beast glove and hit scar king tooth out.
There are Zhilla people and there are Kong people, they are not the same
That was the dirtiest right hook ive ever seen
Godzilla looks overpowered ong
equisdé
Monke and Lizor are superheroes XD
damn it... now I can't deny that Godzilla is stronger than Kong.
Scar king just looking for his brother so he can carry out his euthanization plan
Pues al final, si me emociono el tráiler 😮
Épic movie of 2024 for sure 😍😍😍
Yet another Godzilla film I will not be sober for whatsoever
UGH. Well my excitement just got put out. 'Let's do Kong Vs Evil Kong and Godzilla Vs Evil Godzilla' How MIND NUMBINGLY STUPID. Total lack of creativity.
Bro what is that scream 💀
Superman bout to get wrecked
This will be a VERY GOOD movie and i'm excited for this movie. But in the first 10 seconds, I see a camel fading in the dust and about to fall in the hole I assume 😔
So... let's see here... Godzilla is going to go electonuclear and super saiyan pink? HECK YEAH!
2:26 or 2:27 if you pause it you can briefly see the toddler Kong is fighting Scar King with Kong.
2:13 why shimo has to use its ice breath on the sky .. i think its mothra and u can see skar king on the beach if you zoom it
This is why movies were created. To turn your brain off and watch giant monsters duke it out for the planet for a couple hours.
I can’t be the only one who thinks that it is nonsense.  CGI is great even the best maybe, but the story .. We had mechazilla before and now what, planet of the apes and something like zombizilla .. Godzilla BEFORE Kong was epic. And Kong without Godzilla was great. Togetherness should not be the way. Just my opinion.
How do these special effects look worse than in the first movie?
I can’t wait to play this.   In all seriousness though this look like it could be a fun movie.
Godzilla and the winter soldier
yeah show us the entire movie in 3 minutes thats some next level marketing 😁👍
yo this is so fire you shouldnt release it 🔥
they're bois now let's go
e
😂
Time for Godzilla and Kong to save Theaters once again XD
YES!
godzille zase zajebalo ci co more
The way how Kong punched Scar King and his tooth came out just shows how strong Kong really is.
SHIMUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Movements Look like cartoon
I actually didn’t think they could beat the previous movies but this one just looks absolutely insane!!!!! Also they bumped up the release date! Awesome!
Finally it reached Transformers level of trash!
🔥🔥🔥
dufam ze to bude dobre pice
This looks so stupid. I miss the 2014 Godzilla.
Varias cosas del supuesto guío infiltrado se acaban de confirmar en este trailer Gracias a los de arriba 😇 😇😇😇😇😇😇😇🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😁😁😁😁😁😁☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️😊😊😊😊😊😊
It's so American, they need to be heroes and their heroic moment
Since wen did goj become a girl lol
OH YEAH LETS GO G MAN N KONG THEY BROUGHT DA SMOKE ON THIS TRAILER 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rise of the Planet of the Kongs
They Doomfist Kong?!?!
Hey, it's me. I was in the building that got whipped across the city and punched by Kong, I'm at the hospital. I can't get into it rn but I'm alright.
I think the atomic power of Godzilla is overpassing his limits! For keep it now it scores to the whole body! And the way how he released that new “pulse” ( 2:32 ) was impressing!
I wish Gigan was the main villain.
waste of resource
We got Godzilla achieving perfected super saiyan blue
At 0:31 u can see shimo while fighting godzila
Idk this is just a speculation but Godzilla and kong could be training tho it may not happen but it could possibly happen in the movie
Wow just wow such a good second trailer
Nothing but CGI flexing. Boring.
My biggest question is, how come no one aged in the movies when they went through the portals to the Hallow Earth, and how did Godzilla know they were there and blast a hole into it if there is a time differential? Still looks like a super fun movie.
2:26 not kong hitting skar king with a superman punch
I just love Kong, lol.. 😅😂
💥💥💥💥💥💥💣💣💣💣💣💣💣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️🌨
Godzilla x Pacific Rim when?
Awesome jeez this movie is giving me vibes🎉 wow Truly a valentine gift
2:27 god of war ragnarok, kratos punch Thor in the face and Thor loses his teeth
Super Saiyan Rose Godzilla
I'm still holding out hope for Mothra and Rodan.
If you stop dead on 0:30, you can see godzilla is fighting Shimu on the top right of the screen and Kong/Suko is fighting Skar.
Verrrryy intresting🤒
Monkey with boxing glove vs lizard with lazer
ME VENGO
Shimo is showing
When  r they gonna add pacific rim to the crossover? Since its the same studio
2:42 I love the Power Glove, it's so bad.
I think we are going to see mothra
0:49 Is this scene saying that GoDzila is way bigger than kong  itself now??!!!!!!! 😮 if that.. Then this godzila Version may be the OG one
The world's gonna get Iron-Kong
Godzilla Minus 2 instead please
En los ojos de la niña se ve motra observen bien
Wait are Godzilla and Kong really gonna fight and THERE IS A NEW GODZILLA
Bring Godzilla from '98 back.
Why that mf so *L A N K Y* Dude got arms like Lamar Davis
just cut all the scenes with people only and it might be a good movie
I think it is safe to say: WTF.
In legendary and WB, we trust stay awesome!
looks sick
Kong tries out the Gauntlet: "Groovy."
Dude this looks so hype 🙌
I heard the person start talking and saw the deaf child and immediately, im concerned.
Godzilla has his nuclear pulse permanently now
Bro where is titans shimu
Shimu, YAY!
At 1:40 , all the monkeys have a red palm on their chest. What could this mean? At 2:13 you can see Shimo
Scar Kings servant has those eyes of death.
Can’t wait!
Kingzilla Godkong at their finest.  Looking forward to it!
Didn't we just get a new planet of the apes trailer? This just looks supersized!
Godzilla can do the pulse like thermo but blue OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally! We got to see shimu and thats all i wanted to see and that blue godzilla looked AWESOME!! i cant wait for this movie!
Damn I haven’t been this pumped for a movie since Endgame 😭🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
All I know is, I’d be scared SHITLESS of whatever is making Godzilla and Kong run!!!
So the main villain in this movie is still hidden like the last one, the red ape will be the mid climax fight target.
Something tells me Space Godzilla is going to be the big bad
I love that Godzilla runs in this one. He's like,  "You're mine, BUTCH!!"
Is shimu gonna be in the movie
I cant wait to see them charging together
So the whole movie is in this trailer... cool
I love the movies and they continbue to be benchmarks for HDR TVs and home cinema audio systems.
never was into this saw kong skull island and the older movies they were okay imo never really liked godzilla but this looks pretty sick i can’t lie and i don’t even know wtf is going on 😭😭😭
Im goi g to go watch this movie and im going to love it im sure. In all its stupid glory, but im having a hard ime getting hyped for it after the masterpiece that was Godzilla Minus One.
#SAVECOYOTEVSACME
When Kong punches Skar King and knocks his tooth out you can see Shimo behind Kong.
This is going to be a good movie
0:30 Slow down the video here and you can see in one the clip Shimu who was fighting Godzilla and in center Kong was fighting Scar king
Trailer: "centuries there was harmony... " Me: "Until the fire nation attacked?" Thought I clicked on the wrong trailer for a second. 😅
SHIMO's roar is at minute 1:13 of the trailer and is repeated at 1:26 of the trailer
Kong's looking like he's about to snap half of all Kaiju out of existence.
So damn epic
Godzilla vs King Kong no Rio de Janeiro? Aí sim porra!
Mothra
Bro this came out on my bd let’s go same as the first one
KING KONG  Yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss sir
Legendary thought they were sneaky showing Shimu’s eyes. Good one WB and Legendary
You know a kaiju is terrifying when even Kong shows fear
Damn bru why Kong knocked his tooth out like a peanut😹
Looks like they showed the end scene there
Wiw wow wouw waw wuw
This looks so stupid 😭🤡
crl  o Kong TÁ super POWERFUL
Oh no, this is going to be terrible. Same as the second one.
But se dont see shimo
This gonna be epic
Epic wtf
SCAR is not alone if you guys see the others apes have red colour on there bodies that is means Scar have a large apes group and the other apes they are slaves by Scar Kong will also fight for the others apes to there freedom this movie is unseen and cross the level of Avengers endgame
I just like they aren't afraid to show the monsters anymore by hiding them in a big storm at night or large smoke plumes. They're actually having them be in well lite areas so we can see the fights
Day 1
For those who have not yet noticed, Shimu can be seen to the right of Scar King, meaning you can see his face and tail,  in pause in the minute 2:26 - 2:27
Definitely gonno go to the cinemas for this trailer
Y’all also hear moistcritickal screaming
it includes so much stuff i wanted to see. i hope they haven't included too much so that it overdoes it and complicates the movie
Looks pretty cool
0:30 who saw mothra in the girl's eye in 0.25x slow motion
I hope the full movie isn't here.
So scar is using shimu as his enforcer interesting 🧐
Please keep making monster movies.
He won't be alone gives so much vibe
Cmon, don’t tell me godzilla and kong are gonna fight again
Kong punching Skar king and his tooth comes off... That is awesome...!!
If you pause at 2:14  and zoom in you can get a very good view at Shimo
so sick of movies recycling material, never anything new or original anymore
they done fk up the movie
Oh no, they're heroes now
I feel like Pacific Rim 2 was sacrificed so this could be born.
This is fire asf
This looks lit as fk
What The Frack did i just watch
will we ever get a godzilla or kong movie with little human interaction i just wanna see titans going at it and how they live
monke
Okay, i'm looking forward to Godzilla Minus One. Fxxk this.......
THIS IS GOING TO BE PEAK FICTION 🙏🏿😭🙏🏿😭🙏🏿😭🙏🏿😭🙏🏿😭
I only wanna watch this movie cause of Godzilla
*OH MY GOD*
God Damn 😍🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯 that's what I've been waiting for!
Team godzilla and kong.
Clever marketing putting this out on Valentine’s Day. 😏
shimo face at 2:27 in the bottom corner
Hype hype hype hype hype
looks too crazy, ridiculous and over the top actually......... I loved Godzilla movies because they WEREN'T Marvel slop movies.......
Godzilla king of the monsters will always be the better movie
wow nice trailer 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
On my birthday W movie🤣
Epic
Looks good!
This looks wild!  🤪
This movie is going to heights that we can't imagine. That's why I love the Monsterverse so much, they just keep pushing the scale above and beyond!! ❤🔥
The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in their control, and not the other way around..
Kong lost his hand and he's wearing gauntlet 😮
Scar king is skinny and still beating them is crazy
those 2 ain't scared of nobody
Why don't you just go ahead and show the whole movie?
This movie will be epic
Joder esto es cine
Team Zilla >>>>>
Their battle will be legendary ⚡
Anyone else hear penguinz0 woooo
These trailers are epileptic and predictable. The human plot will keep the film from truly shining. Shame.
Absolute *C I N E M A*
JESUS CAMEO????
So are there two godzillas or their just the same but different color
Cringe overload
Awesome!!!!😂
Please don’t delay
This is horrible.
guardians of nature,proceeds to destroy an entire forest.
so whos the real enemy here?
I can’t wait
This Trailer mwah chef’s kiss
Dunno how to feel about Godzilla Running😄
GUYS! If you slow the video down at 0:31 and you slowly look at the flashing images, you can see Evolved Godzilla fighting Shimu on the right side‼️
This looks awful.
Gives me pacific rim vibes idk why
Why is everything about monkeys in nowadays? Starting to look like the fast and furious saga
No one cares about the human characters ffs all we want is monster action I don’t care about the humans reactions 😤😤😤
I wonder if Mothra might make a return in this movie... regardless, trailer looks INCREDIBLE and Im hyped to see what hapoens next!
🔥💯
Nah they made godzilla op with that new electric pulse
The fact that this trailer even has me more hyped then the Kong vs Godzilla trailer is mad😭 every moment of this movie feels like it’s gonna be hyped af
Titan Tag Tournament.
Godzilla as an EMP....epic! Can't wait.
why am i not exited anymore? these movies look like a complete garbage
Godzilla x Kong is gonna be a 2024 MASTERPIECE and I'm here for it!
I'm excited it's dropping on my birthday. I can't wait to see it
THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE HEAT!!!
You can actually see a glimpse of Godzilla and Shimo fighting in 0:31🥶🥶🥶
Godzillas arms are too short to box with Kong
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Well that was literally the entire plot of the movie front to back. They could have kept so many things a surprise. Shimu, the gauntlet, Godzilla team up, the huge number of apes . . .  This movie is going to have no emotional weight since we know basically every plot point that happens. I don't understand why studios are still doing this.
W h y does it have to be Transformers now?
Mind-blowing 👌🏻👌🏻
I always got the impression that there was some kind of Titan War that happened in the Hollow Earth, but it felt like it was possibly between Kong's species and Godzilla's. I'm kinda wondering if all of that happened and then Ghidorah appeared and screwed it all up, until maybe Shimo froze him, and they had a bit of a truce. The Titans on the surface would follow whoever was King up there, and then hopefully the same would happen down below, but something went wrong? Just some thoughts on it all.
Godzilla seems to loose some weight
Can someone explain to this boomer what is going on?  I get that Kong and Godzilla are teaming up.  But against whom?  Also, what is the significance of the little orange monkey?
This film is gonna be a once in a lifetime experience
They literally just showed the ending of this movie at 2:54
No mames ya parece película de super heroes jaja 😂😂😂
Us- "Can they really top how badass Kong looked with an axe"  Warner Bros- "We've made some minor augmentations"
Brought to you by CRACK COCAINE 😂
-1 was still better
What on earth is going on
They did a good job of hiding the stupid moments and cringe worthy dialogue that this movie will undoubtedly be stuffed with.
They actually show shimu and Godzilla fighting along with scar king in a blink and you'll miss it twords the beginning
E P I C
Woooww
gonna watch this in the theather
Pure goosebumps
Movie is going to be epic af.  So much potential for the future of the monsterverse.
KING KONGS
Honestly looks sick. Not sure how I feel about kong having the furious power fist but should be fine 😂
This movie is gonna be terrible but I can’t pretend like I’m not still gonna see it
Why not give kong 2 infinity gauntlets 1 on each arm
King Louie is tired of asking _nicely._
Kong: Grovy
As Simon would say, “big monsters slapping monster meat”
Why is there a sun if they're underground?
0:28 What a coincidence! I waked up at 1:13 am too and I saw this action packed trailer later discovered this.
Holly sh
Yessssssa
Am excited for Shimu.
Why is it Every Godzilla movie the humans STILL are attacking him -_-
What a trailer
Guys Skar King was chocking the smaller Ape as Kong Punched him wow Skar King might be a Ultron type Villain
I'm so exited for this movie! I give Godzilla Vs. Kong 10/10 and I'll probably give Godzilla X Kong 10/10 too. By the first 2 trailers made by Warner Bros and not fan made trailers, this movie looks crazy! It's definitely going to be one of the best movies in 2024 and it's definitely gonna beat the first movie.
kyaaaa bawaaaaal ttrailer bnayaya he bhaiiii kya bawaal trailler he 🔥fking exited fr it .
Hope they don’t drop the ball especially after Godzilla minus one
This is what writers went on strike for? to come back and write this fucken garbage. Bravo cinema you’ve done it again.
Skar King has a pretty cool spine whip
See mothra at 0:30
How original.
Next Month 😅🎉
Cool, basically saw the whole movies now, thanks
Are in the film
this is 100% gonna be the best omive of 2024
This trailer for Kingdom of the planet of the apes looks different
I wasnt expecting shimo
Lookin good
I hope roden king ghidorah and space godzilla
CGI vomit, pass
for a second i thought optimus prime was about to pop out
Amazing
Thanos Kong…
Godzilla still has mothras ability, nice attention to detail
Still confused who the enemy is
I'M GONNA HAVE THE TIME OF MY LIFE IN THEATERS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who else is pretty hyped?
BRO I’M JUST EDGING TO SEE SHIMU
They showed the whole dawm movie.....
how is this frenchise going on?
Excited for it
This is just too epic
Everyone in the comments hating on kong but forget they even mentioned that Godzilla is afraid of shimu too 😂 and for people saying kong submitted to Godzilla that never happened..kong is still an Alpha
I swear to god if there's no atomic Kamehameha combo from Kong and Goji....
A fuking Orangutan is fighting both a Gorilla and a Lizard,this ain't a robot this time,this is an actual breathing organism fighting two leaders by his own, what a shame these people are displaying for Kong and Godzilla!!
The future of the monsterverse is looking bright
0:30 Mothra as a reflection inside the eye?!!!!
What a Valentines Day gift from Legendary to give us Godzilla and Kong Fans
A fuking Orangutan is fighting both a Gorilla and a Lizard,this ain't a robot this time,this is an actual breathing organism fighting two leaders by his own, what a shame these people are displaying for Kong and Godzilla!!
I want to see that multi heads snake monster that’s bigger than Godzilla on Monarch titans map.
I’m so hyped for this movie
RIO DE JANEIRO PORRRRRAAAAA
I’m beyond over these CGI monster movies. Zero plot and character development.. nonstop CGI chaos. Dull, boring. The domestic box office figures for the previous one reflect a similar sentiment from audiences. I hope this bombs so these cash grabs stop getting made.
JFC, please don’t make Jia a(n even more) Supernatural Native.
Is Godzilla and Kong trained together?
More clips of skar king let’s gooooooooo!!!!
Will they ever run out of ideas?
This is something 'child' me would have enjoyed. The inner child inside me is excited. The adult side is worried this is all action cheeziness.
Welp. I guess I know that this is gonna get a 20% on critics but a 101% on fans. Or the other way around.
Yesssssssssssss
Shimuuuuuuuuuu siuuuuuuuu
29 th March.... I am coming...!!!!!!?
Wow this looks like a totally brain dead action packed popcorn flick unlike Godzilla Minus One. But you know what?  It's a Godzilla movie!  Sign me up!
1:59 no way is that Frozen Godzilla.
I should be more hyped than I am idk…
Jurassic zilla needs to see this NOW!!!!
PAUSE AT 31 SECONDS AND YOU CAN SEE SHIMO
I'm excited. I just like big monsters  😂
WTF is this garbage...
#teamgodzilla
Knocked a tooth out DAMN
2:24 is that Tom Hiddleston’s voice?
Do i need to watch the tv show before this?
Take my money!
Definitely love this trailer in more than the other one very excited for this epic as we love mother nature and movies about epic creatures and animals.
Brasil caraioooo
You seriously need balls to execute such a wild concept, even pitch it to a studio for that matter.
Kongs glove is on the opposite hand that lost its fingers.
PEAK IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
If you slow down the video and pause it at 30 secs, you can see Mothra!!!😍. Can't wait to see the 3 together.
Looks pretty terrible. This is how you ruin two franchaises in one shot.
I never thought I’d care so much about a CGI Giant Gorilla & a Lizard ..   But damn I am HYPED …
Gra fix
More Godzilla Minus One please.
BIG monkee
2:27 I absolutely lost it when Kong knocked Skar King’s tooth out 😭😭🔥🔥🔥
Hey that looks pretty good
Lfg!!!!! This looks incredible!!
2 godzilla
So hyped
Can they make the human characters actually interesting this time? Minus One was mainly humans and that’s regarded as the best Godzilla film now.
I'm guessing Shimu will be defeated by the Skar King joining Kong and Godzilla in the final battle or at least handing his weapon over to Kong. I know it sounds predictable, but it's a basic movie formula. One that keeps the audience happy and frankly I would be happy too, if it ends like that.
When will we get to see "godzilla weds kong"
i chanvge my minde im actually hyped asf for this movie now, goji looks great, if ghidorah can still be one of the top monsters than everything is perfect
Wtf😂 Warner bros keeps milking it forever
😮😮🤯 amazing
What is gonna be the best 2024 movie godzilla x kong , beyond the spider verse , despicable me 4 , or kung fu panda 4 , thanks for the likes ❤❤❤❤
2:34 never heard they roar from Godzilla
I feel like when Godzilla releases the electric blast they used Shimu's roar.
ive loved every film in the monsterverse so far especially GVK and GKOM. Im sure this will be the mkst epic of them all and i hope WB continues with a few more films leading up to a DESTROY ALL MONSTERS FINALLY.
Was waiting for toretto to show up
Wow!!!
godzilla under miind control by evil kong now im 20000% confident
I do love G14 and K17 for their more realistic tones and intepretations, which is essentially grounding them closer to reality, but this trailer was sick and if this is what they want to do and take the franchise, then I can respect them for it.
A lot of great movies coming out this year theirs Deadpool and Wolverine theirs Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes theirs Twisters i’m more hyped for Kong and Godzilla so great to see them back this is gonna be so badass and i can’t wait 😁🔥🔥👍🏾
I will see this film!
This better be as dumb as it looks
Very happy 😍
This is going to be the greatest movie ever in the franchise
Stupide aucun intérêt
0:31 pause vid and tap this i see shimo
YES YES YES!! This movie still has their rivalry. I'm going from opening night to premire
This movie is going to be amazing Edit: SKAR’S WHIP IS LONG
It's going to be crazy can't wait
Ridiculous and I'm here for it
They can show this off but not Coyote vs Acme? #Releasecoyotevsacme
Lanky Kong has had enough, no one’s gonna make fun of him again 🦧😤
This is the trailer I'm waiting for 🔥🔥
This looks so stupid. The cgi is terrible The writing is worse
King Kong is not last monkeys, lemurs, and apes The Earth
garbage cgi
Stop calling it an "infinity gauntlet", that's a Fallout Power-Fist.
Nope
Did anyone else hear the ‘woooooo’ part of moistcritical/Charlie’s ‘yeah baby that’s what we have been waiting for’
All who are hyped like this comment 👇
I’m so happy about this goofy franchise. 😂😂
Godzilla and Kong fight again wonder who’s going to win?
Why is the CGI looking super cheap now?
Was Shimo controlling Skar King of Skar King was controlling Shimo?
All good but Fala chen
Apes together strong. 🦍
Blue, pink, black whatever it is man just keep bringing them
I can't stop watching this trailer!!
Pause 0:30, who is that guys?😏👁️
Why tf is godzilla fighting kong again
Minus One may have completely blown everything out of the water, but I'm still HYPED for this.
I am even more hyped for this movie
We got iron Kong and I'm excited
1:53 yoooo shimo. Can’t wait for this movie
This movie might be even better than minus one! This is insane.
Love that lemmon is in the movie, sad that tangerine isnt tho
LETS GO
Every time a new one of these comes out, I appreciate the Garth Edwards one, more and more. I miss feeling the size of the monsters.
This actually looks so dumb :(
This certainty looks like a Hollywood movie
These movies always have some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I really appreciate that
0:13 shimu?
Шикарно 😎
O man this is gona be crazy
CGI looks trash tbh but I will still see it 🔥
Stupid
My boys are back
So used to getting lackluster movies and trailers and finally we get something this epic and entertaining. Cant wait!
I'm ready for this. Is it March yet?
Kong vs scar king and Godzilla vs Shimo. This is gonna be one hella of a fight
Protect Mini-Kong at all costs
Waiting
Jesus this looks so damn stupid...I'm totally here for it
Toho and Legendary switched places. Japan's Godzilla is now serious and America's Godzilla is a circus 🤦🏾‍♂️
Espectacular y no han mostrado nada aun de la batalla contra Shimu
2:27 shimo just be vibing
go cringy every part
Mini kong
This is cool
yeah, yeah, 100 minutes of human drama, some jokes, some forced diversity and inclusion and maybe 12 minutes of monsters. pass me on this one
The only question I have is are we going to experience time moving differently when they're in hollow Earth like in the Monarch series?
This is going to be an experience for sure. Can't wait.,
People after godzila minus 1 "finally west will see how to make a proper movie" Hollywood "nope".
Warner bros gonna cook with this one 🙏🙏🙏
this is so cringe
Frostzilla 😨
I'm here for it. Better than anything marvel has done since NWH
alexa play the original teaser for the 2014 godzilla
Can someone, anyone, let Godzilla and King Kong to lay off the Pyramids at Giza. No business taking your dumb big fights and destroying ancient pyramids and coming out of the underground yet to be discovered artifacts and human history. What are they? High? Save the Pyramids! Don't get me started on the running movements... and where's Baby Godzilla? Equity, EQUITY!
Hobs and Show
I FKN LOVE IT
Wauuu..god damet..this is f.king awsom man...jaaaaajkssssss 😂😂😂😂looooool 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😊
Ok I’m hype!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
not a Kong expert, but who's the bad guy in this movie?
Let’s go Godzilla, Kong, Skar King, and Shimo abou to be the best movie of 2024
Guyz mothra has been confirmed 0:29 second see her eyes you can clearly see mothras face just slow down this trailer and pause each second you can see it it's just a fraction of second but you can clearly see mothras face in her eyes
Thank god Millie Bobby Brown is not in this movie
Wow looks amazing
Godzilla and Kong showing that tag team wrestling is still a thing
Give me the Joker tráiler!!
Shimo!!!!!!
I really can't wait for this movie
This time not VS, it's 🦍 & 🦎
0:31 godzilla and shimu they are fighting
the kaiju royal rumble would have been a more accurate title cause this looks insanely fun can't wait
Team Godzilla 🔥
they gave kong his own thanos glove😂😂😂😂
This is probably might be TOP 5 HYPE MOVIE OF THIS YEAR!
I am so stoked! This is gonna be incredible
Movie of the year
These movies are a joke now. The only good Godzilla movie ive seen was the Godzilla (2014) with Brian Cranston and Aaron Taylor........
This cartoon look so silly..... silly fun. I'm buying a ticket for it😂
Why they got people in this movie? I want just a big monster edit.
1:04 bruh we did NOT have this type of technology in Godzilla 2014, this is literally 10 years later 💀
I'm really looking forward to this!
maaaan. now for the rest of the monsterverse all i'm going to think of is that the pyramids of giza are destroyed lol
"sir, godziller can run now"  "what?"  "theres also a new monker"  "oh"
The comedy relief is not needed. The actor is just fat and bumbling. Could barely watch the last one because of him.
DEFINITELY GOING TO SEE THIS ON THE 1ST DAY
You guys should go watch Godzilla Minus One. Maybe you'll actually make a good movie.
Такой кал пиздец,раньше Годзилла был большим,а сейчас он чувствуется маленьким
Not bad, I am interested, we will watch it
Stand Together or Fall Alone. That is an exceptionally cool tagline. This movie is shaping up to be a lot of fun. From Rose Godzilla to Infinity Gauntlet Kong to the new bad guys. This is gonna be a blast.
Godzilla and Kong getting along is cool and all, but this is gonna be another cringe action flick like the other two movies.. we need more movies like the 2014 godzilla movie or like godzilla minus one. Stuff that actually feels real and scary
This movie is gonna be sick
Mothraaaa!😍😍😍😭
Trailer 2💯💯, way  better than trailer 1.
THIS IS GOING TO BE SOOO EPIC! 2024 IS THE YEAR OF GODZILLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like a couple of the acotrs but they also kinda ruin it for me, every scene with kong and godzilla got me hype!
Is it me or do the titans feel…smaller? Either way, I’m quite excited for this movie.
It’s nice to see Godzilla using his nuclear pulse! I want to see more of Shimo’s design! The leaked toy pictures don’t do her justice. For those that may not know Shimo’s name means frost in Japanese. ❄
Never mind kong and godzilla! I wanna see Doug with baby kong Riding on him Charging Into battle🤣
0:30 I’m sorry did godzilla just do a pulse? 0:31  YOOOO HE DID is that Shimo in the back and a pink godzilla? 0:51 bro had too much radiation
1:53 Guys We reveal shimo
Ohh 😮‍💨💯
I want Godzilla type movie like the first one
WOW😮
UFF WAT A TRAILER
#Vommalaaaaaaaa
why does it feel like i'm watching transformers?
This movie is looking super promising so far were getting blue burning godzilla were getting ssj rose godzilla we getting kong with an infinity gauntlet If we think of scar king as kang the conquer this movie would be complete
I can already tell it’s Shimu they’re afraid of not scar king. Who’s scared of a skinny orangutan?
Team Kong————->
I am rock solid
I love that Japan has been doing the more tragic and unsettling Godzilla movies, while the US does the monster fight/showdown Godzilla movies. To me, it's not a one vs the other, or is one better than the other, I'm just excited to live in a time when we get both.
Trailer 2 is so insane! Finally, I can see the Scar King fight against Kong is my favorite part of this Trailer. Growing eyes & freeze breath is like Shimu.
2:13 worst cgi ever
Long live Godzilla!!
Hopefully everyone has been following all of the Monsterverse. Skull island and Monarch should be seen before this because it sets up this movie/universe nicely.
That punch was personal 💀🦍
👍👍👍☺️🤩😊🥺😲😍👌👌👌
CGI looks bad, plus the titans move like there are normal size
those blue eyes in the dark.....shooting a silver array of energy....that has to be space godzilla
Team Godzillaa—————>
Come back godzilla and king kong❤
Wish ya didnt show this much of the trailer lol
Looks like it might be decent. Probably do well. It doesnt look like most do these days.
Tf is this garbage
Meh, probebly be another fuckup.
*KOTM was peak, it’s just for retards now
Trailer of the year hands down.
Looks like they going Apeshit with it
This coming out on my birthday OMG 😁
The film looks a little colourful or is it just me
what is lemon doing there
At this rate, monsterverse might introduce some universal threats in future movies.
1:56 that is not atomic breath 💀 is it really shimu?!
Wait, are they gonna fight on Rio de Janeiro?
I have to say, Godzilla looks funny running.
As much as I love the classic TOHO movies there's just something about the Lengendary one's which make me feel so hyped.
Okay I’ve been fine with it and or tolerated it for 4 movies now but seriously the humans need to stop talking. This ain’t ur movie step aside
On 0:55 is that shimu or godzilla but a blue thermo mode i cant tell
King Kong coming from below the Egyptian sands with a mech arm is an iconic moment.
Is that the ice spitting shimo?
1:25 this right here is what I think is a mothra egg: why you may ask well is because that in case you haven’t been catching up with leaked toys on the back, there was some kind of butterfly/moth character so maybe Mothra is reborn in because in the credits,in kotm when the serg Tankian Godzilla song was playing, you could see there was a newspaper or something that said a Mothra egg was discovered or maybe it’s just like a secondary character like the jackals that was chasing kong
Lmao this looks so terrible and brainless compared to Minus One
Наснимали уже бреда дикого
2024 blessing us with some hyped movie trailers.
This movie is going to be remembered as a movie that was a film!  So incredible.
Bro, why do I hear Charlie going "Ooooohhh!!"
YEP this trailer sealed the deal, WE RIDE TOGETHER FOR THIS VICTORIOUS FILM
Idk why i still miss the Animatronics days of Godzilla.
KONG GOT THE INFINITY GAUNTLET AND GODZILLA ACHIEVED SUPER SAIYAN ROSE! THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC YALL!!!
After seeing Godzilla Minus One, this just looks like garbage
Godzilla and Kong! Together at last!
So much better than the teaser trailer.
They need god gaddam
0.30 sec dechko 0.25x speed par final battle scene hai pura be
Me wathcing this trailer: "screaming and giggling like a japanese schoolgirls"
I think it’s cool, but it’s kinda cringe tbh wish we had more films as the 2014 Godzilla almost a horror film or skull island
Looking forward to it. Been spoiled recently, Godzilla -1 & Monarch already in the last few montgs
Watching a frantically scurring Kong flailing about is absurd to behold.
This looks soo gooddd
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
HE PICKS UP A BUS AND HE THROWS IT BACK DOWN!
How many times are all these places getting fing destroyed in this universe?!
Was hoping Mothra would show up to juice Godzilla or just do the benevolent moth thing
As a loooong time fan of the MonsterVerse, it's simply the best franchise to me out of all the existing with NOBODY even a little close, I can say that with this movie studios behind are getting into some quite different direction. It's DEFINITELY NOT dumb as newcomers thinking, it's simply DIFFERENT !!
The start of this trailer gives MASSIVE Godzilla 2014 vibes. This has the potential to be absolutely unreal
GO GO GOJIRA!
Goood el trailer
Wow 😱😱😱😱
🔥
1:50 feels like LEGO Bruce Wayne zoom gif I use all the time XD
At first I thought it was a transformer arm coming out the ground. I was like here we go with that multi verse BS...
Vfx downfall.. 😊 I think..
It would be better without all of that cgi puke all over the screen. Does everything have to freakin glow?
All of the yes
Crazy man
ufffff
Godzila Blue ❌Super Saiyan Blue✅  Nuclear/burning Godzilla ❌ Super Saiyan God ✅  Pink Godzilla ❌ Super Saiyan Rose✅
I really hope they’re gonna bait and switch us with a different villain. I literally can’t take a Kong palette swap seriously as some supposed big threat that Kong and goji have to team up against
Since when did Godzilla get electric powers I like it and I also like the pink design but I'm still curious what the thing in the cave was??? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Very very nice 👍 trailer amazing I like it ❤❤ 😮😮
Wait Godzilla can now breath ice ???????????
WE ARE SO BACK
As someone who prefers Godzilla, I’m sooooo glad this one is focusing more on Kong again. He’s the most human of the titans and I think a bit of an underdog here, considering he’s going to fight Shimo and Scar King. He’s truly a king just like Goji, and is braver in my opinion 👑🦍
I miss the more dramatic take on these monsters. Godzilla KOTM was the last good movie in this series.
I guess Shimo is the reason Kong doesn’t have his axe
Why do you keep putting human characters? They really ruin the mood a lot
Ништяк 🤯
You know, it's funny. Everybody says I have officially seen it at all. No they haven't so always gonna be something else that's gonna surprise them
CAN. NOT. WAIT.
Oh yeeeaaaah Shiiimuuuu
With the Godzilla x Kong vs The Justice League comic out later this year, I'd totally watch a movie with Henry Cavil's Superman punching and lasering Titans. Have him take a full blast from Godzilla and realise in comparison he's just a Kryptonian.
Вау!!! ❤
❤
I wish people would just leave Godzilla alone. He really don't be bothering no one lol
Omg - what a awesome trailer. Lets HOPE the movie holds up. Way to go the director of this Monsterverse  film.
"BUMBLEBEE and the PINK RANGER, finally teamed up!!
🔥🔥
Looks cool. But my goodness ever since Godzilla minus one. I don’t think any of these will top that
Yeah yeah, Gimme Space Godzilla or Gigan next
Unfortunately I dont think any of these will be out Minus 1
godzilla and kong ... 🇮🇱
WHERE IS DOUG!?
Pov me and the boys joining the lobby to get that W:  1:07
2/10
Finally some Orang love but Yo where the Gibbons at??
Storyline wrote by some toddler
I’m confused why Godzilla is going back  and forth between his blue lightning and pink lightning.
Kong vs skar king 🦍 Godzilla vs Shimo 🐲
they're milking this hard eh
"Godzilla and Kong teaming up is like that unexpected duo in a buddy cop movie where one's the grizzled veteran and the other's the rookie with anger management issues. Together, they're taking down villains and skyscrapers with equal enthusiasm. 10/10 would watch them crush it again!"
Hulk Smash!!
Ohhhh shoot!! Can’t wait!!!
SHIMU!!!
Kong is absolutely flabbergasted when he see's shimo
Godzilla x Kong is one of the most awaited collaborations of the season. There's nothing else that screams scary more than this. The effects are monstrous.
This is gonna be epic🤯🔥 🦍very excited for it🦖
This is EPIC can't wait for the release
So this is the new Transformers type movie franchise.
And they wonder why Hollywood is failing
Looks like we will have a fight right here in Rio :)
Kong and Godzilla running for their lives is crazy 😂😂😂
This trailer was epic! Can’t wait to see Shimo!
God
Finally shemo is here
this is going to be epic
Lost brain cells watching this
This how action movies suppose to look like from now on 🥶
That’s all we get is just the eyes and breath of Shimo
Best one yet
Godzilla Minus One: We live in a society  Godzilla x Kong: KAMEHAMEHA!!!!!!!!!
King is King 👑
This almost feels like a fan project after watching the awesomeness of Shin Godzilla
WTF
i love pinkzilla
Eyyyyyy
I’m down for this! Who’s the enemy though?
OMG WARNER BROS ARE COOOOOOKING THE BLUE GLOWLY GODZILLA SCAR KING LOOKS FREAKING AMAZING SHIMOS ICE BREATH IS ACTUALLY GOOD CGI THE CGI OVERALL LOOKS FANTASTIC BEING A BIG FAN OF KAIJUS I WANT THIS MOVIE NOW
For centuries, the world has belong to the titans. Oh, and apes, I guess.
Rise together, fall together. - Sidious
Blankboy gonna have a field day with this one
Looks cool but i think Kong should not be as big as Zilla.
Sooo...was that a 4th kaiju or was godzilla powering up the axe?
100$ says the next movie is a hybrid they need to fight.
2:34 The roar of titan.
series peaked with the king of the monsters. this one looks terrible.
😔 I don’t think I can enjoy a western version of Godzilla after seeing how Japan does it, this looks like a kids movie which is fine but sad that I probably won’t enjoy it.
MACACO MACACO GIGANTE NO BRASIL
from what i can tell kong will start winning against scar king and scar will call shimu for help
เดี๋ยวก็ทำเหมือนตัวเองผิดอีกเชื่อเถอะแมนเรา
Buckle up everyone... This is going to be one helluva ride.... Can't wait 👏👏👏
1:25 guess Mothra's in the film. Kinda wish it was a surprise but okay.👍
Just looks terrible
This crazy   bro fast forward the earth to march 29 already, all awards await this movie 🥶
God damn Warner Brothers likes losing money
Hope they understand we don't care about people in this movie!
The only one who can defend them both is JOHN WICK Just give him a pencil
👇🏻release day anyone🤷🏼‍♂️😅
This is going to be epic brother 🤑🤑
Brazil before a Titan battle. Brazil after a Titan battle. These are the same image.
Oh snap, everyone in the top floor of the building that was chucked at Kong died on impact when it collided with his B.E.A.S.T. gauntlet.
Obra maestra, mejor que el padrino
Let’s just talk about how Kong literally punched Skar King in the face and caused him to lose a car sized molar 🦷 just brilliant
Why make King Kong a gray-haired old man?
Ian gone lie kong got a mean left hook he knocked that boy tooth out
Yeah Epic
I just need it to be fun and absent political commentary.
I wonder how scary-looking the unseen Titan is?
Guys simu was there
ебааааааа с перчаткой скыдыщ
This looks so fun. Godzilla 2 disappointed me hard, Godzilla vs Kong saved the franchise for me. Those movies are allowed to have color and spectacle, not constant military babble and crying. Pacific Rim should be the base for all western Kaiju movies. Lets just turn the table and let the west do the camp and Japan do the serious ones. :P
Thank you Hollywood for 25yrs of insomnia cures. I was asleep halfway thru this tripe. Imagine a world - where you do better 💤 😴
Now i want Mecha christ the redeemer teaming up with the Statue of liberty for a tag tournament
Not gonna lie. The of this movie I see the less I want to pay to see it.
After Minus One, this seems a lot LESS exciting 🤷‍♂️
Is that gauntlet has 6 infinity stones also?
They gave Kong a Fallout Power Fist
oh mannnnnnnnn
When the bully and the nerd have a common enemy
Okay Kong getting his arm injured after being frozen makes sense
🙄
Kuch bhi maane kuch bhi 😑😓
Thank you
Japan Godzilla: strong legs strong tail thick body, a giant god of destruction with great power. American Godzilla: Long scrawny legs and hands, a giant skinny mutation lizard.
Brazil
Sounds like the MoistCr1tical "WOOOOO" was played through the trailer, but highly distorted
GOD-zilla IS BACK
When did this franchise turn into the Power Rangers?
Rosezilla came to the rescue
Not wasting a dollar on this mess…
I wonder what's gonna happen 🤔 Trailer: 🤗
I can’t wait not to watch this movie but watch every review bashing it
Anyone fancy going to go watch this with me I live in England and very lonely Im scared to go alone
1:07 they brought him back??! 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂😮‍💨😮‍💨 He was by far the worst and most annoying character in the previous movie!
Another Adam Wingard/Simon Barrett/Dan Stevens team up after The Guest but with a Hollywood budget is something I never thought would happen but I'm glad it is. Excited for the flaming hot garbage that's about to ensue.
It's like Goku and Vegeta vs Baby and Goku Black
Never buzzed so much for this can't wait
Looks incredibly stupid and tedious.  A bunch a weightless cgi replete with generic human characters we don’t care about just barfing out exposition to explain each ridiculous scene
Freaking dope. Hope this trend continues with more primordial type Kaiju in future.
When are they gonna go to the fireworks factory
Love the retro PS3 graphics!
Scar King needs braces after that punch 😂😂
SHIMU FINALLY REVEALED LES GOO
So it's literally good Godzilla and Kong vs evil Godzilla and Kong
I found Mothra in eye
This looks freaking great!!
Why did they give Rebecca Hall such a terrible haircut?
Take the whip away from Skar-King and he's a nobody
JFC how does the CGI in this look worse than Peter Jackson's King Kong from 20 years ago?
They're showing too much wtf? ☠️
Kong & Godzilla they hate each other, but at the same time they like each other
Yeah, I can already tell this is gonna be a movie I'm going to skip. Feels more like a Kong movie to me than Godzilla and Kong. There ain't no way Skar King and Shimo are stronger than Ghidorah. Just not my cup of tea in general, preferred Michael's KOTM and Monarch series.
Where's Mothra?!?!?!?!?
I think I'll skip this one.
My best guess is Godzilla and King Kong are going to fight again in this time King Kong is going to win the fight against Godzilla and once he wins that fight, he’s going to ask for Godzilla help to fight scar king in the man is right they don’t have to like each other, but they can work together as a team now that’s called respect in my opinion besides in the last movie, Godzilla did win the fight and almost killed King Kong but yet he spared his life and left him to his fate and there’s only one thing that those two legendary monsters have in common, they both care for the world that they live in, and they would do anything to protect it no matter the sacrifices but I can’t wait to see this movie. It looks epic.  P.S I don’t know if that’s actually going to happen. It’s just rumor I made but I won’t know until I watch the movie. I just hope I’m right. Because most of the time I’m pretty good at guessing trailers before I watch the movie.
Kongimus Prime.
This looks profoundly stupid. I can’t wait.
Gaaaaasssssssssssss 😂🔥
Why do they always make Godzilla's head so ridiculously small compared to his body size?  It looks stupid, and lessens the visual impact.
Godzilla 🦖and Kong 🦍 Have Their Hands Full In This One
magnificent!
Fkn chills
Scar king look like Beast titan from Aot 😌
My fav ship
0:54 blue thermo
I'll say it Kong being wangless looks weird. At least with Planet of the apes they gave them a patch of fur to be like they're there but you don't have to look bat them with how humanoid this Kong is it's uncanny.
Ohhhh yeahhhhhhh I’m definitely definitely watching 100,000%
OMG WTF🥴
Godzilla x Kong will be Epic when it comes out and I can't imagine the number of people who will go to the cinema to see it wow I can't wait, it's a true masterpiece 👌
I became slightly arouse during this.
Also i have only seen the Godzilla movies from 1998 to now,also i havent been keeping up much so i dont know who is shimo godzilla
W MOVIE CANT WAIT TO SEE IT
Ohh ok dude froze and broke kongs hard
What a huge piece of dogshit
This is gonna be insane🔥
Another trailer that gave the complete movie away and now I don't have to go see it in the theaters but just wait for it to come to some streaming service. Thanks Warner!
0:31 Shimu fighting Godzilla
I'm so happy of this kaiju movies reborn.
2:50 Bro thinks he’s DoomFist 💀💀
Looks good
CGI looks horrible lol
i love this franchise. it is a pure adrenaline and fun moviegoing experience. keep it up! loved the new show.
When Kong said “Its Kongin’ Time” and snapped the infinity gauntlet it sent chills up my spine 😮‍💨👏🏽
Cinema is back
Just can't wait for it
This trailer just made my day, can’t wait to see shimo in action !
Godzilla vs shimu 😮😮😮😮
No word….. just no words
This new Planet of The Apes movie looks nice
Seems like Kong got that power fist from fallout 4
Shimo is already Super Saiyan White or maybe even Ultra Instinct while the G-man is still SS Rose. He better be Ultra Ego by the end of the movie. Joke aside, this trailer is electric. It's scorching hot (or is it cool as ice). I can't wait to see this film.
damn
The first was awful so imguessing this one is too
i feel like there doing to much now. and i’m all here for it
I’m out. Lol
So this is the guy Godzilla was fighting in the cave painting in Cod
So Godzilla goes from Super Saiyan Blue to Super Saiyan Rose, and King Kong gets a gauntlet made by Tony Stark.  This looks hilariously dumb and I i am here for it.
Thought this was transformers when I saw Kong hand 😂
Tô todo arrepiado! Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh
Why does it look so cheap and heartless? It's all animated so weird
Only seen two Godzilla movies  Kong Vs Godzilla  And Godzilla Minus 1  Gotta say I liked the Japanese one better, felt like I was actually watching a film  This looks like it was made to sell action figures  Looks enjoyable but not like it’s gonna have me use much critical thinking
We destroying Egypt with this one 😩
They are really starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel with these movies
Kong vs Godzilla came out in 2021.if this new movie is coming out almost 3 years after it better be good
When are we going to get different monster main characters in this so-called (by the fans) Monster Verse???
My balls just dropped!
Pressureeeeeee
We got kong with an infinity gauntlet before gta6
They show way 2 much
A magical child in a dangerous universe? I'm surprised they didn't cast Pedro Pascal.
I can't wait for this. Now we can finally get TV spots later in February and March.
They’re turning this into god damn dragon ball 😂
Glad to see Godzilla is still blue sometimes
2:29, yea, me too, I've seen everything this movie will be, saved me the tickets
SHIMO LOOKS SO AWESOME
We got polar opposite Godzilla movies and I am so here for it.
They really gave Kong the Power Glove
Cinema. 🚬🗿
OH BOY OH BOY
Tf when this movies going to end
I am speechless! Godzilla is sick! Scar king is sick! I have never been more hyped for a movie!
DID NO ONE NOTICE SHIMO IN THIS TRAILER? THERE'S LIKE 3 CLEAR SHOTS OF SHIMO 0:30 fighting godzilla in his pink form 2:13 shooting his breath into the sky and 2:27 behind skar king before kong knocks skar kings teeth out
1 Kong is special.  100 Kongs is boring.  You've made King Kong boring.  HOW?
Hehe monkey go boom.
Planet of the larger than previously depicted Apes
Jesus… how many movies of these mfs fighting are we going to get
Who wants Godzilla X Kong to make 1 billion dollars?🖐🏼 👇🏼
Will happily be watching on my computer the same way I’ll be watching Coyote Vs. Acme if we’re lucky it leaks cause I’ll be dammed if I’m seeing another WB movie in theaters lol. 🎉🎉🎉
Planet of the apes meets King Kong & Godzilla
This is hyping me up even more. They just keep getting better and better
shimuuuu
🔥🔥🔥
Was hoping to see the big guy in this one
Kong looks more bulky then he used to look
Kong bows to No One 🔥
@unknownkajuverse: HAMMER! ❤ Das wird ne mords Gaudi!
Kong bows to No One 🔥
I like how some of the songs resemble previous versions of the character
Omg!!!!!!!
this looks so dumb....love it
Why they did not show this at Super Bowl?!
Hype
Be ready for the epic battle 🥶
The trailer giver away like 70% of the movie at least.. lol
That running scene still ruins the trailer for me, they are treating this like it’s a buddy cops movie ! 🤮
That mean 2 boss level monkies and two boss level lizards it gonna be fun but they exposed whole movie plot in this trailer
My new idea t shirts and this on ps5
2:32 Sweet! They brought Nuclear Pulse back!
0:31 we can see Shimu clearly at the speed of 0.25
Paper Boi!
Fortnite Ch 5 S1 under the iceberg!! It’s Godzilla!!! To be revealed in S2…
Hold on a minute playas. This will now be a tag team match. HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA
I'm so psyched for this for so many reasons!! I'm so glad my babysitter back in the day introduced me to Godzilla; it feels like it's all been for this movie!
Wowoow..... super excited ....can't wait to watch !
Why he got the black ops 2 galvaknuckles on tho
The only 2024 movie I'm hyped for
OKKKAAA MOKKKAAAA❤️‍🔥🕺FIREEEEEEEE UHHH🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Electric pulse in monsterverse?
Is he fighting Cranky Kong?
This is gonna be terrible. I can’t wait.
Soo...Godzilla Minus One meant nothing to anyone at the big studios.... Great. Cool.
Lets gooo🔥
Hopefully we see more Titans appear
No hate i love godzilla as a franchise but each new film looks more like a power ranger episode
Am I the only one who thinks this looks 3x times better than the previous trailer?
I think that the godzilla that did the ayomic pluse isnt godzilla but another species of him because how did godzilla go from pink with sharp dorsal fins to hes blue states one is imposter unless godzilla changed some how
which is godzilla and which is kong???? and why is there blue and pink colored godzilla???
THIS SEEMS it's going to be EPIC !  PLEASE.... don't break my heart by bringing a bad movie... please !!!
Kong: "I love the power glove. It's so bad."
Loving this Franchise.
*Everyone:* No! Godzilla is pink! 😭 *Godzilla:* 0:51
2:27 is a quick glimpse of shimu you can see him in the right
Is this movie set in the MCU?
🥶🥶🥶
Godzilla Minus One RULES!!
Im getting Rampage kinda vibe (not the movie but the game)
I like how all of us already know the story but here for the screentime of the titans.
Im surprised how there’s any human infrastructure left at this point
Let's gooo!!!!!
Cannot wait
First Trailer is fire & now second trailer is Perfect I saw Kong fighting scar king can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️💥💥💥💥😎😎😎
Its really impressive but i notice some cgi flaws
The strongest Titan has arrived....... Let see who takes the spot Godzilla or Shimu.......
😲 😱 😲 OMG 😲 😍 😭 💖, godzilla fanatic my whole life this will be EPIC...😢.
Looks terrible to be honest. Has the look of like a ps4 game.
Godzilla is way better than goku, saying he turned SuP3r sAlY4n R0s3 is an insult to the King of the Monsters.
6 months and i still remember the hype for this.
godzilla minus one released y'all can stop now 💀
Kong with super punch? Aweee.. you know me so well ❤️
I might go see this
Beautiful
Wow tout simplement wow
Kong socking Skar in the face so hard his teeth falling off is hysterical
Godzilla Minus One has and will continue to beat every Hollywood-made version and I stand by that
We’re eating good
THIS LOOKS HORRIBLE.  HOLLYWOOD IS FINISHED.
Bhaiiiiiiieee kyaaaaa zheerrr bana dalaa!!!!!
At the end of this movie. Kong has to become “King Kong”!!!
Yes. Yes to all this. I don't care if the story makes no sense. Yes to all of that!
Eeeeeeeepiiiiiiiiiic can't wait
oooooohohoh my gooodod!!! im so exciteeed!
Why does scar king look so thin
As long as bobby brown is not in the movie it should be ok. Surprised seeing legion in the movie though.
Pack a punched Godzilla and Kong with an infinity gauntlet.
Well the Franchise starts to become a Toy Commercial only.
It would be so awesome to have one of these movies without human story, all monsters on their quests!!!!
Shimu finna give g&k that belt 😂😂😂
YOOOOO THIS LOOKS SICK
here
Ok, this is just a cartoon now
Looks absolutely mega
The trailer ist so epic reveled much things the movie but very epic 😊 excited 😆
Balam Industries sponsored field trip to the Hollow Earth.
swole monke + lizzie vs lean monke + icie lizzie
Omg the views in the first hour ❤❤❤❤
I'm more excited about the Monster Verse than I am about the MCU, this movie is going to be epic
Soon on PlayStation 5
I got an ad for this and i only saw the halfway point between kong and thr orange ape, at first i thought is this the next trailer of the new planet of the apes movie? But then remembered, no the vfx and physics are just worst
Donkey kong and browser coming to save the day when Mario and luigu ain't there.
One of those movies that is so stupid that it’s actually good.
FINALLYY🎉🎉🎉🎉
this looks so trash oh my days
a joke compared to minus one
So that’s why kong hat that gotlet because Shimo freezes his hand
Wow so they fighting two things ? But even kong and zilla scared now this shi gonna be fire
wowwwwww
Man knocked the tooth out of that titan
Dumb
Proper next level blew ma mind and my load lol
Scar kings Molar blocking traffic and that, pedestrians getting squished, you can snatch my 20 bucks
Godzillas scream
Un peu trop de destruction pour rien
If they skip the human storyline it could be dope, Godzilla vs Kong was lit minus those pesky humans.
I’m really looking forward to this movie 🤩🤩🤩
I don't know if anyone noticed it, but at 0:31 when you slow it down you can see Godzilla fighting Shimo in the background
2:13
I LOVE THE SCAR KING
Knew he was going to hurt kongs arm leaving it unable to work without that glove
0:30 mothra? 0_0
Americans and Western countries criticize and label the people  who defend their families and themselves from the barbaric Western colony in the Middle East  While sitting in their comfy chairs, watching their favorite movies, and routing for the good guys  while in reality, they defending The Colony that killed more than 14,000 children in three months  by the money that they give to their countries as "TAX".  #rajeen
Yea buddy!
I'd go see this if it were in 3D.
Don't forget to google images of "Godzilla X King Kong". Only epic fanarts of course!
godzilla and kong 4 ever😃 scar king iz coming
Lol
My soul purpose in life is to see this movie 🤯
This is a badass trailer right here. I love it
Man I really want this movie to be good but I must admit I have my doubts. It might be Morbin time once again
Ahh, so it's a tag team match. Nice.
We want the Queen Mothra !! 🦋🦋
THIS IS INSANE 🔥🔥
Omg 🗿
Goku and vegeta are not only two who achieve godhood the king just did
حمااااااااااااص🔥🔥
Kong's storm breaker was beaten so he have gauntlet 😅
Yesss this is abt to be fireee
You know, as ridiculous as it is, and as incredibly dumb as it seems to be getting, I just feel the need to keep watching these movies.
Kong is so disrespected in the monsterverse they needed to give him a whole metal gauntlet for him to keep up why even have him in the movies
goosebumps again
I really don’t understand why or how there is a new Godzilla film every other week. It’s getting really old really fast
Bruh. Who tf greenlights these projects.. 😂😂
This looks very cartoonist. Disappointed
0% Guy here! You don’t know me yet!
I..... am.... Kong.... Snap!
cooool el trailer  me gustooo
Planet of the Huge Apes
Oui
Sign me up. No further encouragement needed.
❤❤❤❤❤
I judged this movie too soon, I used to think i wouldn't like it, but WOW. i already love it
One of the best trailer seen in 2024🔥🔥
Early March Dune 2 and later same month Kong and Godzilla 🎉🎉
Save some for the actual movie, please!
Seeing Godzilla and Kong going up against Skar King and Shimo makes my day happy!
Hate when they give away the whole plot in the trailers
2:27 that hit tho
Oufffffffffff ❤️‍🔥🥵 goosebumps da BGM is so dangerous ☠️💥💯
Kong got GvK flashbacks when he saw Shimo.
Nice! Can you release Coyote vs Acme, too?
Fk yeah
So that barbie Godzilla is an ally or an enemy?
If that's was a second "Godzilla" that's either Biollante or space Godzilla.
Cartoon
Hardest trailer Id evet sene💀
Is anyone going to say anything about why Godzilla is attacking the people again. Like am I the only one who noticed that. ❤ Also. Shimo better look cool, like everyone who has been to the test screening is saying he is. ❤
People: we don't need a new colored Godzilla we want old one but powerfull  Editors: we gotcha, proceeds to add pink color,
SHIMUUU!!!!!!! you can see a glimpse of him if you pause in 0:31
Hmmm so this is it, Kong is here 😅
Can’t wait let’s come back after we see the movie cool
CHIIIILLS
Move over, Marvel!
Man I can't wait for my boy Godzilla and Kong to fight skar king and shimo
SE VE SUPER CHAFA Y ME ENCANTA 🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍
Give us the Joker trailer! PLEASE!!
Shimo, The Skar King AND MOTHRA Are Coming!
МЕГА ЭПИК 😮😮😮
Never in my wildest thoughts did I think that Godzilla vs Kong would rival the fast and furious franchise in terms of utter insanity and I’m all up for it 😂
I like to think Big G and Kong just Spar now every time they come across each other
What in the world shot the ice beam Also I’m excited to see how godzilla got to be blue and do the cool thermonuclear pulse. I know it’s not thermonuclear godzilla but it looks like the thermonuclear pulse that he did
2:27 there is Shimo here
Well, that's just some straight up bad acting and VFX, isn't it? At least get somewhat of an amateur team to do the 3D models, textures, rigs and lighting for them, instead of someone who doesn't know anything about the process prior to the movie.
This movie looks so good bro
Looks like kong is gonna lose his axe
I am sorry for being blunt but Godzilla just looks silly with such a tiny head. Why does WB think that looks good? He should have a squeeky helium roar. You know it is going to be stupid when there is a "baby something" to appeal to kids and people who luv things like baby yoda.
Monke powaaaaa!!
Oh dear, This looks terrible
No shimo?!?!?!?
2:53 Me and Bro
can we get a monster movie without some random forgettable character's boring story added in? nobody is watching these movies for anything other than the monsters
Lets GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Holy shiy!!!
Disney purchased Warner Bros????
Shimo looks so god damn cool
bellissimo😮
If you look closely at when kong rocks scar king it’s cause he was holding up baby kong by the neck so that punch was to save him 2:27 that’s awesome
Full action and entertainment
I just can't imagine the scenerio .... When there will be a war between a team vs team (Godzilla & Kong) VS (Shimu & Scar) the fight between a lizard with a ice lizard and gorilla with a orangutan ufff 💀 pls just can't wait for the movie release it asap
Boy oh boy I hope this movie has a post credit scene for future movies 😊😊😊🤯🤯🤯
Oh baby
This feels kinda like a meme with all these insane upgrades but I love it
Their showing everything in the trailer except doug.
Hyped ❤💥
WOW!
Is Kong taller than the rest of the apes ?
Is it me, or does the trailers show the whole movie beginning to End now a days
WAIT I JS NOTICED SHIMO BEHIND SKAR KING WHEN KONG PUNCHED HIS TEETH OUT
I thought CGI was supposed to get better?!? Looks like early 2000’s still
yeah Shimo froze Ghidorah
This is what Vince used to do in WWE 😂
Is Warner Bros going to cancel this movie for a tax write off too?
…Honestly this saves the movie for me like holy ***
See... there. Great CGI. Is that so hard?
🐒 Monkeys vs. Lizards 🦎
The greatest cop partner movie ever
Dayuuuum
This is so lit but i dont like that almost all trailers today basically give away the plot of the movie...they don't need to give so much sometimes
2:27 shimo head in right bottom corner🔥
So now their is no peramid in Egypt in this universe 😅
Where do you even go from here?
Super Saiyan Rose Godzilla and Kong with an Infinity Gauntlet are a perfect duos
2:27 ouch. Skar King is gonna feel that in the morning
OMG this looks hilariously bad 😅
Looks over the top, cheesy and ridiculous - and its awesome. Movies are meant to be fun, and this looks like a blast.
Feminazi propaganda here we go 😂 !! Nice bot comments warner, getting clipped soon with your zilla and your barbie
0:31 here you can see Godzilla fighting Shimo and Kong fighting Scar King in the city
❤
DO NOT REVEAL THE ENTIRE STORYLINE IN THE TRAILERS.
This movie looks absolutely bonkers. And that's what I'm going to love about it. I can tell it's going to be so wild and ridiculous like the later Showa era fims.also, Scar King looks so cool.
This is gonna be insane  Waiting to watch it ❤❤❤.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🤨Pink scales now huh🙄A lot of.....Pink...Why? Is Godzilla a female? Am I missing something? Or is this the usual. Them being acknowledged?
and someone will build village only for deaf and dumb
MOTHRA IN THE REFLECTION OF HER EYE!!!! 0:30
A very expensive looking movie
I'm sooo hype for this. Can't wait to watch Kong/Godzilla duke it out with Scar King/Shimo
какая чушь просто атас
Mann..seems like this is gonna hit the most in the titan history....😈😈hope to see the total series once again at a cool midnight..😇😇😶‍🌫️
late night gang
Godzilla Minus 1 ❤
I’m hyped for this
"We raar together, we bite together, Tiatns for life!" 🤣🤣
Kong and Godzilla 🔥💥
am i the only one who sees mothra in her eyes at 0:30
Now this is more like it!!
2:25 Tom Hiddleston voice
I like how the monkeys all know kung fu now.
Glad that they took a chance at new villainous kaijus.  If you are going given a big time budget for a new Godzilla movie, you might as well come up with an entirely new kaiju instead of flipping through the rolodex of old ones.
That's was amazing. This is going to be epic Godzilla movie 😮
The hype is real! Also that kinda looked like a mothra egg they were touching :-0. Aaahh i wanna look at shimo though
Yes, Can't wait to watch this epic battle ❤
OH MY GOODNESS
Epic showa shenanigans
Looks like they will manipulate or hypnotize Godzilla in a moment of the movie.
Probably going to be bad just like the last one.
u can actually see godzilla and shimo fight, and shimo shooting his breath into the sky at some point, if u blink u miss it, btw why was skar king holding suko when kong punched his teeth out?? 💀💀
"Kong can't fight this on his own" "He won't be alone"  Then the entire M-She-U appears and walk menacingly towards the enemy while all the feminists cheer.
Found a new reason not to commit suicide. Thxx a lot.
GO THE PUCKING AXE WAS PONITLESS
If you Pause it at 00:31 and you will see shimo fighting Godzilla. The hype is real!
Movie looks trash 🗑️
🥱
Goosebumps bruh ❤
Maybe the movie will be alright, but movie trailers have gotten so annoyingly bad in recent years.
This movie looks absolutely ridiculous. And I am HYPED.
Masterpiece 😍😍😍😍
I wish they didn’t focus so much on Kong. He’s boring
WE GETTING TRAILER TWOOOOOOOOOO
woww amazing work 🦍🦍🦍
1:52 shimu  entry 😳🥺🥺
2:57
another movie that has to do with grabbing from the store movie section
CANT WAAAAAAIIIT
Who was that on 1:53
Ian ready to throw hands if anything and I mean ANYTHING happens to the baby
Pause at 0:31 is that Shimu?
I hope aliens appear and the trailer is not revealing everything.
Of all the kaijus under Toho galleries, of all the monsters from the Godzilla cartoon, of all the exciting new designs they can come up, the villain of this film is just another giant ape......
It's a monster verse tag team championship..... place your bets folks! 😅😉🤣
movie of the year
Epic movie on the way 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wonderfully cheeseball monster movie! Can't wait! :)
People be looking like ants. lol
how many fkng Godzilla movie do you need ?
This is just big ol' monster fighting dumb fun and I'm ALL HERE FOR IT
Already movie of the year
I just need to hear Godzilla's signature roar sound or else. Also that blue shockwave giving Thermonuclear Godzilla vibes
This looks bad lol
This better have battle focus more than human screen time!! 😤
Michael Dougherty should direct this film..😍😍
A bit of fun but utter shite compared to the recent Japanese godzilla film..
Ayo they got Lanky Kong in this
OMGGFFtrrtrrz
At 1:27 and 2:34 you can yeah Moist Critical screaming WOOOO in the background
Watched the whole movie in the trailer
Mentira, moro no RJ e não vi nada disso acontecer, mais uma web fake para o mundo 😢
No thanks.
God this movies gonna be sick
Long live Kong….. Long Live Godzilla!
The look of genuine fear on Kongs face when he see’s Shimo just gose to show how intimidating this titan is and the instant frost bite from its breath on Kongs axe is insane.
OooooooMG this is going to be the best movie ever
So sick of these awful movies
A classic tale of Enemies to lovers… this is going to be Epic!!
As if the 1st trailer didn't hype this up enough, they knocking building sized teeth out in IMAX!!!!
I don't even care about the story....I just wanna see big monkey and big lizzard smashing buildings.
Can we all agree that regardless of how this movie does, at least Millie Bobby what's her face isn't in it.
Great, another annoying child character who will get more screen time than anything else smh
I will say that the cgi could be better
After watching Godzilla Minus One my expectations for this movie are low.
Wooooooooooooowwwwwwww
Am I the only one who thinks they added Charlie’s “WOOOOO” sound effect?
Finally shimo
In the nicest way possible this trailer makes it look like all the neighborhood kids got together and are all playing monsters. Idk the way they’re standing and screaming reminds me of little kids running around like madmen
Godzilla, you are strong and fast like a gazelle. You will win.  No way.  If we win, we get 300 pesos  *Monster hand shake  (If this movie doesn't end with a giant monster handshake and a cheesy song about the title characters, then what's even the point)
0:31 we can actually see shimo for one frame.
SO THATS HOW KONG GETS HIS LIGHTNING POWERS
Small. Kong look like. Mbappe 😂😂😂
Why do i have the feeling of one of them dying? 😭😭
Yeah. Im in.
0:31 if you pause at the right time. I suggest using .25x playback speed. You can see Godzilla fighting Shimo😍
Is there gonna be 2 Godzilla’s 😮?
1:50 bro looked absolutely shocked
God, who writes this kind of stories? it look like shite written by an ADHD teenager + ChatGPT
I don't know what the plot is and I don't care. This looks amazing. Now....team them both up with Pacific Rim....uh the first Pacific Rim not the second.
I never clicked on something so fast
Mothra rises
How many time I have watched this trailer I can’t even begin to count
This movie is gonna be peak!
0:31 Skar King vs Kong/G vs Shimo
This seems the silliest, stupidest, MOST childish American Kaiju Movie ever made.  Can't wait to see It in IMAX
is that moistcritical’s scream they used every time they screamed?😂
Cant wait for season 2 of monarch
BRASIL PORRAAAAAAAAAA
Godzilla in 2018 💀
Well get ready to witness a new history.  A great theater experience is being prepared.  A new battle begins here.
By God, this looks much better, it looks like it's going to make a good Kaijus movie.
Like also je dat kijkt
1:51 The look of pure horror on his face ☠️
Man, i liked this franchise and accept that previously there was too much human drama instead of titans screen time, but this is just absurd, godzilla running like he weights 40 kilograms is more relatable to fast and furious than the monsterverse.  Sad to realize that the peakof this movies was king of monsters, definetly skiping cinema this time
lets turn Godzilla PINK very WOKE...!!!!! might as well just label it LGBT Zilla, f*** pathetic, a franchise disaster!.!
We rise together  We fall together
Skar King and Shimu, now that's a combination that would make even Ghidora tremble with fright.
The Monsterverse just gets bigger and better!
This is ridiculous 😂
When the trailer is this hard, you KNOW it is gonna be a *god* tier movie! 🗿🔥🔥🔥🔥
now this is alright...
Centuries? Honey Godzilla been stomping around since 2014 in your cinematic universe what harmony are you talking about??
Ah, so godzilla and Kong are now part of the MCU? 😅 ugh this trailer is giving me mcu and transformers vibes not godzilla 🤦‍♂️
S**t IS THAT SHIMU?! 1:53 2:10 NAH GODZILLA AND KONG ARE SO FU**ED UP
Oooh i cant wait 🫨🙌🏽
Kong reminds me of thanos with that robotic arm.😂
No. Good thing I am grateful to not be part of something like this. It cannot even be as grand as King of the Monsters and Final War. Gojira and King Kong are ruined by woke mainstream media filth makers. WB and entertainment systems like Toho and whatever could have united to bring Gamera, Mothra, Gigan, and Rodan with those two with newer characters, but this story is just a fraud. This was made for people who do not even come close to know Gojira.
Already too much of the insufferable human characters in the movie, and that was just the trailer.  That's gonna be a pass. I'll catch it when it's free on a streaming service or something, but I'm not paying to see more of this trash story with these terrible characters.
Holy f**k looks amazing.
2:31 moment epic😮
Looking good
Dang Pink Godzilla vs Shimo at @0:31 mark
2:50 the power of the infinity gauntlet with the power stone
.
Thanos (Kong), goku black (g-man) vs whip ape 😂😂😂 brother😂😂😂
wtf is this garbage
This movie is going to be the Blockbuster of 2024 🔥🔥 #Teamkong 💪
Ufff que ganitas de verla ya en cine!!!!
Boner!!
Seeing Mini Kong this cute and adorable really lifts my heart!!!!!😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
One snap and kong is thanos.
Kinda mad that y’all spoiled so many good moments but I’m definitely not complaining 😂
“For centuries there was harmony” …then everything changed when the fire nation attacked
to ficando louco louco louco LOUCOOOOO😊
This is great!
They really made diddy kong in this movie
Probably the best movie of 2024 right here. Props to sound dev too!
Always Godzilla only
You can see all 4 fighting at 0:30 !!!
On Valentine’s Day? Are they dating?
🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤
These movies would be so much better without human dialogue. Annoying characters and always that token "funny" comedic relief that's never funny.
What are the pronouns of Zilla and Kong? 😂
God this movie looks horrible lol
Unemployment has hit me harder than this movie ever will. But a lot of employment opportunities gonna come in the re-construction of cities and it cherishes me.
Is bar khatarnak hai bhai movie waiting 29 March
epico
This is so ridiculous but that’s what we’re here for!
What a visual mess
Planet of the Apes jumbo edition
Watch carefully between 0:30 and 0:31 there you can see Shimo and Godzilla fighting
Was it what I saw? Did Shimu attac Kong?😮
❤Kong ❤Godzilla... Both more powerful together 💪💪 Two mighty Heroic Titans take on Villians  2:51  powerful fist blow from Kong💪👏
Bro this is gonna be such a banger this will be a all time movie for sure. Good good Legendary.
id rather watch Rick Ross and a simple Orca run a half marathon. by simple I mean modest mods. obviously.   (and im not referrencing Rick bc of this or that. i just havent been able to watch anything to do with Godzilla in that past 25 years and not hear Bad Boys x Jimmy Page.  i also want some Pepsi now too.  and Rick recently mentioned his connection with the great cousin, so perhaps this could be a good charitable event. it certainly wont gross as much. but. id rather watch it.)
I so can’t wait until til it comes out. And guys did you see suko fighting alongside Kong!? Hopefully Godzilla can beat shimo because that ice blast seem unstoppable 😱🥶🫡
Holy lord above this is gonna be an insane movie!
Kong's character development is lit🔥🔥🔥
Wowww
Godzilla and Kong:The new marvel universe.
Will this be better than Godzilla minis one? Let me know
Awesome 🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:53 UH OH! HERE COMES SHIMO!!!😳
The Great Apes were protectors of humanity? But the Saiyans wouldn't have...oh, right
Looks awesome
Warner wtf is this ?😂😂😂😂
Take my money!!!  Finaly The Movie which will bring back audience to theatres
Eh… seems a bit too over the top. And the scale seems off. Some scenes seem like a normal gorilla and a big lizard.
.
Why does godzilla sound like the femur crusher
They're really gonna destroy my Rio de Janeiro? LOL
This is going to be epic, goku rose and  gohan beast
Awsome!! Uploaded 2h ago and already 1.2M views... what am I doing wrong?😅😅😅
😱😱🤯🤯🤯
Godzilla and Kong playing Ark. what a duo!!
Gorilla king of monsters is underrated
Kong will teach who is daddy🙂
Omg
This looks so cool I want to watch it already😬😫
Fun fact: my moms name is shimu 😭
Which of them is Superman and which is Batman?
This looks epic.👍😱👍
Good God! I want this now!
🎉🎉🎉
Kong with the superman punch was cool
Holyyyyyyyy
2:12 AQUI É O BRASIL!!!
Liked everything except the return of the annoying comedic relief that isn't actually given anything funny to say. Once again the monsters are the best part of these films and the humans are the worst part.
Godzilla x Kong = kongzilla
LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!!! THIS IS HYPE!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It can't be worse than the last one....right?
0:31 you can see shimu and Godzilla yoooo
2:34 this is the first time godzilla used atomic pulse in the movie,I’m so excited for the movie
this gonna be ten times better that GVK
This looks so unbelievably stupid, ill take Minus One over this anyday
Apes together strong 1:30 1:34 1:35
Can't wait for next month! The ultimate 2 vs 2 showdown of the century!
I love this movie and can't wait to watch it in the theater 😊
If you put minimum speed and pause you can see Shimu behind Kong and Scar King holding mini Kong
2:27 KONG SUPER PUNCH!!! 🦍👊
The way they changed this universe into corny Marvel movies is criminal
I am sure this one gona be distroy all previous record Cant wait.... 😮😮😮
0:55  wrong with you why are your blue
Hey.. Kong nd godzila .. love u from INDIA.
Looks awful. I'll be seated day 1.
2:27 that felt personal
they're releasing these like YouTube videos
Stupidest budget ever approved. Seriously, are children writing this garbage now?
Behold Iron Kong....
0:31
What monster was shooting ice at kong?
Watching the trailer reminded me of my childhood me and my best friend who were each other's enemies before but one day we saved each other from other school boys and then we became each other's best friends. But my friendship didn't last long because he drowned in the reaver I still miss him 😭
Jai Shree Ram,Hanuman!
Adam might aswell give fraudzilla reality warping molecule manipulation logic manipulation law manipulation and omnipotence because the amount of upgrade fraudzilla is getting in the monsterverse it didn’t even get that in toho films
The X stands for kissing. They will make out in this one❤
Did they spoiled the entire movie?☠️🪦
He won't be alone...
2 godzila
Legendary has been putting in that work with the monster verse
🔥🔥🔥🔥
When Godzilla rages out and does that nuclear pulse type explosion near the end 🤌🏼 Long live the King
it reminds me of warzone event 😢
I wonder which city is about to be destroyed this time.
WILL IT BE THE BIGGEST BLOCK BUSTER OF 2024 I LOVE THIS TRAILER SMTH INTRESTING 🏳️
Gonna be movie of the year undoubtedly
This franchise turning into Transformer movie series
All the best from PSPK fans!!!
Kong🔥🔥🔥💨💪💪💪
Great first there was Gadzookie, now there's Konggie
This is gonna be LIT!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks better now then the first trailer lol. I hope in couple months later on the secret hidden villain shimu is the next king kong godzilla movie. 🎬 🎞 😮
Just saw shimo scar king and another Godzilla. now im hiped
1:39
Can't wait for Kong to say "and I'm king Kong"
So guys i dont know why goji is charged to max maybe he saved so much and decided to evolve into pink form goji
Giant crab claw was that ebirah im still betting on destoroyah in the next movie
The fact that the movie would be out already if it weren't for the date being delayed to april, at least it moved to march
If they could talk its actually the rush hour but monsters
AWESOME!
King Kong got the Infinity Gauntlet and Godzilla learned Kaioken lol
0:29 in gias eyes you can see the reflection of mothra!!🩵🦋
This is where the fun begins
Looks fun but Godzilla doesnt move like an animal at all XD
Ooooh yeah, this is gonna be another great epic for meeeeeee.
i want to see kurt Russell in this
Who actually likes any of these movies bro 💀 “OMG THE BIG LIZARD PUNCHED THE BIG MONKEY LETS GOOOOO”
Looks awesome‼️
Is Shimu a member of Godzilla’s species??????
This... looks... awful!
Waiting for this movie 💥💥💥
Waiting ❤
I've just finished watching Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire, and I couldn't help but notice a significant shift in the CGI and VFX effects. 🎥 It feels like this change began with the first Godzilla vs. Kong movie, where both Godzilla and Kong didn't quite evoke the same sense of awe and terror as they did in Godzilla (2014), Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and Skull Island. 🦖🦍 In those earlier films, they were portrayed as gigantic, formidable beasts, forces of nature to be feared and respected. 🌋🌪 However, in the Godzilla vs. Kong movies, they seem to display more human-like behaviors, losing some of that primal, monstrous essence. 🤔  I understand that Kong, being an ape, has more relatable characteristics to humans, but the Kong I encountered in Skull Island was a creature that sent shivers down my spine. There was an aura of primal ferocity and mystery surrounding him that seems to have been somewhat diluted in the newer films. 🌟 What we need is for Godzilla and Kong to return to being the terrifying, awe-inspiring monsters that once roamed the Earth, instilling fear and wonder in equal measure. 👹🌏   But amazing trailer over all just one small thing i noticed that i think need some attention.🤗
Smashing the double tap to rewatch that fight scene at 1.42 over and over again
Now this is a banger, and I know bangers
2:17 - 2:25 "🙄And just 'cause Godzilla's atomic breath is pink, it doesn't mean he's LGBTQ now. 🤦‍♂️Stop reading too much into it, Internet."
Shimo can fix global warming in a minute!
Cant wait for this.. Still hiding shimu though, yes see the ice beam an that but still..
Goji center u were correct kong got injerd and godzilla got a new pulse i thought only thermo could do i nah this is epic
Wow I love when they show the whole movie during the trailer
I, too, am inspired by the hit 2018 film _Pacific Rim: Uprising._
I've seen this entire franchise, but can't remember anything about them
trailers show too much these days
It just burst through my pants
"Long Live The King" 🔥💪🏻👋🏻
Holy fck
G14 and 19 will always be my favourites. This looks fun - Titanus Gojira looks badass again but Kong’s contraption is silly tbh😂
This looks so dumb, I love it!
Alright.
Bruh🤯
Ah feels like it’s 2021 again.
Godzilla Multiplied by Kong?
This is the equivalent of Roger Rabbit but in 2024. Cartoons mixed with some humans.
this looks absolutely terrible!
Why do I feel like mothra is going to show up again to help Godzilla
The pitch: Kong and Godzilla mixed with Planet of the apes, transformers and Marvel.
Now imagine this if it wasnt so stupid.
THE MONSTERVERSE LIVES ON!
Man I love kong his the coolest
This is Kino.
I am hoping this will surpass godzilla 2014. The monsterverse films have not been better than 2014, so there might be some hope for this film to be better than 2014
Can’t wait!
Power gauntlets and wormholes now. Can this franchise get any more stupid🤣
ебаться не работать!
Goose bombs
I need this movie now
Cant wait for the next evolution of ultra instinct Godzilla and full stone infinity gaunlet Kong 🔥
2:27 Shimo😮
How could anyone watch this after seeing Minus One!? Oh boy.
It looks like Pacific Rim 2 Uprising 🙄😒😞
They've already destroyed most of the earth😂
Godzilla did a pulse like hesei I love that
My favourite movie ever i am so excited i cant wait anymore 😊😊😊😊🎉
Неправдоподобно.
kong vs scar zilla vs shimu
What is this stupidity, I love it 😻
I'm hyped up
Less gooo
WTF IS THIS CGI ...WAY WORSE THAN THE FIRST MOVIE
Kong literally the best character who doesn't learn lol i love his character and goji the big G
iiissshh, this looks like a giaint hot pile of steaming…
Pls😅 Give Thanos his gauntlet back🤣
The Godzilla movie universe delivering better movies than DCU. Production could’ve disappointed or scaled back, but they never compromised. They keep building on what they have and now we have a banger waiting for us on March 29th!
Anybody else remember when Godzilla represented the cataclysmic destruction of nuclear war unleashed on the Japanese people?   No we're out here doing marvel-level teamups with Kong to fight? How did we get here?
Looks awesome but i hate that they forgot the other titants
Godzilla minus one totally not better than this
This is fake or serious? 😂😂
1:18 I’m glad they showed this again many people missed it the first trailer. It showed Kong running and an ice trail chasing after him. He could be getting attacked right here. Shimo was prolly causing havoc down in the Hallow Earth.
2:18 Zilla > I’m so hyped for this movie!!!!❤
Yooooooooo
YOOOOOOOOOO HOLYYYYYYYYYY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIII
2:31 did they just have bro scream into the mic
Can't wait to see this and the new Ghostbusters as an EMPIRE double-bill!
Sign me up
SHIMU
SOMETHING about watching godzilla and kong run like that doesnt sit right with me.
Oo man I just can't wait 🤩🤩🥳🥳
Wow I can't wait now ...best trailer I have ever watched
I'm so happy we're finally getting more original monsters as villains.
Okay first Deadpool now this 2024 is gonna be the year of kickass movies I'm calling it now
Many thanks in advance to Warner Bros and Legendary, really appreciate this birthday present. You guys have rose together to the occasion and I can honestly say I’m going to have the best birthday ever…heck I might even lose a tooth 🦷 😢
We need to see kong hit some 1-2 combo punches
Godzilla scream is actually just MoistCr1tical
Doesn't have a shade on the new planet of the apes movie. Much more emotion in that one.
Super Godzilla Rose
nice to see Betty Sue Flowers is back.
Isn't the baby girl the same girl who was in 'The Meg's?
I’ll pas this to.
MMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU DDEEEEUUUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSS DO CÉUUUUU.............ESPETÁCULARRRR............
Verithanam🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This movie is either going to surpass KOTM or be dumb to a fault. Hopefully it's the former.
HYPED!
🔥 🔥 🔥
STILL THEY NEED CHILDREN IN THIS MOVIE THAT IS SUPPOSE TO BE SERIOUS MOVIE, THE LAST ONE I ONLY WATCH FOR TEN MINTES AN SHUT IT OFF.
what is even happening lmao
So actual villain is basically godzilla with an ice beam
They'll both have iron man suits in the sequel ppphhhfffrrrttt
wtf happened to these movies after Godzilla king of monsters
Kong better help Godzilla drop kick someone
brooo march 29, thats 9 days after my birthday!!! gonna wish to go see the movie XD
cringe overload. im ready
W trailer
os cara vai brigar no RJ, aí vi vantagem
Can't believe they got MoistCritical to voice Godzilla's screams <3
After Gojira Minus One, this looks like a joke
Просто фантастических масштабов дерьмо
they done gave kong the infinity gauntlet
godzilla is afraid of nothing.
now i have seen everything... that saves me two hrs of that movie
Can they stop having the child chosen one in all these movies
This is amazing 😂😂😅😅😊😊
Pure Goosebumps 🤩😈
Will it be somehow related to the Monarch series??🤔🤔
Kong bows to no one
🔥🔥
😂😂😂😂 Hollywood just gets dumber and dumber
This is my coffee of the day
I'm in, let's go!!!
Yes yes and yes
This was actually insane. I'm sold. I'm going to watch this.
Finally a Godzilla/Kong movie featuring a baby kaiju that isn't completely useless!
0:31 is godzilla evolved vs. shimo and kong vs star king, I think this will be the second or final fight. Like if you agree👍
Tag team 😮😮😮
Leave Godzilla to the Japanese... They can make a good movie about her
SHIMO
Yep that’s more then enough to know this is gonna be a good movie to watch just like the previous
That shot from 0:48 to 0:50 is most likely of Kong looking up at Shimo completely towering over him, which could very well confirm Shimo’s status as the largest creature in the MonsterVerse. 😉
Godzilla solos ngl
This is so good 😊 and fantastic I can't wait for the movie to release 😊❤❤🎉
I didn’t know I could cream this much from a trailer
"I miss my wife, Kong"
Kingdom of the Planet of the Kong X Godzilla ft. Donkey Kong Jr.
I'm ultra hype for this movie 😮
It’s a bombastic action blockbuster that’s not trying to take itself seriously and that’s the best angle for it I think.
now am pumped
Koba vs Caesor in 9D
Remember when godzilla 2014 came out and kong skull island came out and it was the humans vs monsters and vs other mutos… well that was awesome. How’d he go from that to this. I’ll give it a chance and watch it but I’m not sure. I really want more stuff especially from legendary similar to godzilla minus one  Or if they wanted to do something like this it would’ve made some sense if the big bad was ghidorah. I honestly wish they saved ghidorah for a Godzilla and kong movie. But again I’d prefer more stuff like godzilla 2014 and godzilla minus one when it was more realistic.
I reacted on this trailer 😬 No need to sub, just come watch please, trust me that my Live and original reaction. Nothing scripted 👀👀
Mothra: This thing, this creature, seems to feed on energy. Kong: This thing is from another world. My world. Mothra: I've killed things from other worlds before. Godzilla: Is she with you? Kong: I thought she was with you.
This trailer basically spoiled the entire damn movie wtf
Daaaaaaaaaaamn🤯🤯
2024 gonna be awesome 😎
It's going to be most popular movie of monster vers❤
I just want to remind everyone that we’ve gotten here because a movie starring Bryan Cranston did well.
Okay, so now the American version of Godzilla and King Kong movies are becoming like Marvel...
Thanks for showing me the whole movie smh -.-
janky cgi😢😢
They just spoiled the whole movie
Looks ridiculous and silly, but worth a look!
I’m sorry the bowl cut from terminator genesis just ain’t it lol. Also I really hope they focus on the monsters and get more screen time . A movie called Godzilla with him unit less than 20 mins is a joke . Loved king of the monsters ! Also if you change human main characters every movie we have no one to attach too but the monsters who get 5 mins of screen time . Def hyped. Also the cliche of a character saying something as it cuts to them and their lips don’t match it ? Come on
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen?
Donkey Kong and Yoshi vs Cranky Kong
Who r watch this trailer from india🇮🇳🇮🇳
As a zilla, I approve
Why did you shrink Godzilla? He looks silly when running. But aside form that still excited for this because GvK was actually fun. Just gimme more of that, fun.
shimu/shimo looking fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
SSJR godzilla and a monke. EPIC
They might be afraid of shimu
That was AWESOME AF
I'm going to be watching this right as my college decisions start rolling in.  It's going to be one heck of a ride.
SCHEIẞE JA MAN!
Unbelieveably hyped for this Movie
Many of them talking about the tooth might be scar king’s but I suppose it might be kong’s. that’s how trailer scenes end up opposite in the actual movie😂
IS COOL😎🫶👍🔥❤️
RIP Godzilla 2014
Planet of the apes but giant monkeys
Kong punching through that building was amazing.
❤
❤
Fast n the furious
❤
YES !!!! It doesn't matter if they like each other THEY JUST need TEAMWORK ❤😊 i saw SHIMO!!!!
Who are they fighting?
1:25 That thing that guy was touching was definitely the egg of some cousin of Mothra or something like that.
DOpe.. Kong was throwing down with SKar King and Shimo by himself..
This looks bad AF, they turned Godzilla and Kong into a transformers movie, all the unnecessary CG is just hideous... Running titans just takes away all the scale and weight on this characters, guess physics don't apply to them. Viva Minus one!
Minus One makes this look like transformers
This looks so dam awesome
Welp it seems that I have already seen everything that I needed to see
I am so pumped for this team up!!!
0:30 is that red one is scar king bruhh this movie gonna f*** up
Shimu!!! In 00:31 second!!!
Badass!!!
Movie of the year everyone
I don't get it...are they fighting against that red Kong and the blue Godzilla?......What did they fear?
Who are they fighting? We don't get to see that. This is trash
1. I saw the look of Kong, and he looked terrified, when I think he saw Shimu 2. Kong just broke scar king’s tooth 3. , I think we might see shimu in trailer 3
Im 39 and i find this trailer hilarious esp the dialogues,im so not the target audience and for reference ive seen godzilla1 in theater and i enjoyed it. But this movie is not for and im a movie enthusiast.
It's a bad sign when I can't be arsed to just watch the trailer to the end.
come on people you should know how garbage this is going to be. lets see what does better godzilla minus one (budget of 15million) or this 200million pile of something
Estoy tan emocionado de esta película 🎥😍
Can't wait for the next movie '' Kong vs godzilla vs superman vs John wick ''
I have a feeling this film will be 100x Better if every time Shimo uses it's "Frost Breath" I make a stupid Mr. Freeze Ice Pun.  Shimo: "Freeze Well Ape-Man!"
Im going bonkers watching this trailer!!! Dayum!!!! Thats mad good!!!!!!! IMAX Pro Max Ultra!!
Are they making Godzilla kind of a villain again bro?! He destroyed those planes! THEY ALSO BROUGHT BACK HIS THERMO NUKE EXPLOSION DUDE! Also anybody else notice that the sounds waves sound like a meme that we have once heard. Cant think of it but it sounds familiar
too marvelly
This is getting stupid...
This trailer is insane
🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yikes! This looks terrible.
wow
NOICE!  #Godzilla3
0:31 Shimo and Godzilla fighting on The right
Well.......trailers these days show the whole plot, then be like come watch the movie 🗿
Looks amazing
1:13 & 2:33 - Woooooooooooooooooh, yeaaaaaaaah baby!!
Wow Wow WooooW... Super Duper Blockbuster. I Just love the kong.
How many times Godzilla gotta whoop all them ?
finally something to watch at the cenima
Jesus when was the last time a good movie came out 😂
Baby KONG!!!
They have shown us full movie😅
I hate monkeys
0:01 The stones bouncing off each other like a plastic toy break my immersion right in the beginning 🥲
wow so nice to not see one of those pre-trailer trailer trailers. "GODZILLA X KONG NEW TRAILER STARTS.... NOW"
Gorilla vs Kong
Story-wise this looks like Fast and Furious schlock, but you know, I'm definitely going to see it for the explosions galore and Godzilla roar!!
the sec after godzilla do pulse you can see a ice berg and shimo
is it me or looks like potato cgi ?
Well, this was my only Valentine’s Day gift.   Thanks Legendary.
Kong’s infinity gauntlet looks super dope‼️
Why are trailers so bad now? So many drums and Boooooms and Bwwaaaaums!
Japan Godzilla giving us existential crisis and a reminder of the great horror that these monsters are capable off. American Godzilla is giving us total insanity and awesomeness. I love both
Respect mais bon godzilla qui tape un sprint bof bof
İ guess kong will fight another kong which is marked 2:37 i mean tiny one attacks it too
Im not a fan of godzilla movies but this looks fire good job warner bros
The Shimu revelation and the why Kong has the Infinity gauntlet is just amazing
Kong: I've been offered a gauntalet by humans  Meanwhile thanos: okay okay now he have gauntalet then later on he'll capture infinity stones also... I mean are you even serious about that 😨.
2:34 too powerful Godzilla in this version
They gave ma boy the Hulk….i mean….Kong Buster 🤦🏾‍♂️
Trailer 2 is awesome
This trailer had me fist pumping in the air and screaming in glee like a kid!  I'm in my early 50s by the way. Godzilla fan for life. #GodzillaForever
Bada$$ 🔥
is this canon to Monarch?
🔥🔥🔥
Vfx is so cheap...😂😂😂
Kong knocked the teeth out of his mouth
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Did anyone else see all four of them battling at 00:30
yes please more
0:30 IS THAT 2 godzillas
This Is Beyond My Expectations Can't Wait To Experience This On Big Screen 😍😍
2:00 is Shimu
F the haters, I'm liken it.
🔥
I can  wait no mone!!!!take my money.
GODZILLA HAS HIS THERMO NUCLEAR POWER????!!!!!
Pretty cool that these two monsters are allies!! Monster power!    Also, I feel that chimpanzees whip thing was an Indiana Jones style move
I want a third Trailer with Shimo already!
I think the girl is scared of Rebecca Halls hair cut
Amazing. Just described this in one word.
Great, so now Kong is a transformer and Godzilla has been infected with some sort of Tron virus.... I don't like the direction this appears to be heading.
I don't care what when who will hapen. I will go to cinema for this as soon as posible
I love how now, we have two different types of Godzilla media.  On one end, we have Godzilla Minus One. The equivalent of fine dining, a place you reserve two months ahead of time. Well worth the time and money spent.  Godzilla x Kong, is the equivalent of your favorite indulgence food. A juicy burger, pizza, or a big bowl of noodles. It ain’t exactly “fine dining”, but godamm if it ain’t good.  Everyone can have their cake and eat it nowadays. What a time to be alive. Long live the kings. #GodzillaxKong
Godzilla and kong are going to be so epic, WHO IS READYY
King with the infinity gauntlet what’s left now is for him to acquire the infinity stones
Bruh 😍😍
Hombre ver mono y lagarto pelear, hombre ser feliz.
Shut up and take my money!!
At 2:26 u can see shimu barely, far back to The  right
What's next transformerd fight Godzilla and Kong
Kongs got all the stones lets goooooo
Best trailer of the year I've seen so far
This is goin to be awesome, cant wait 😊
Why is there so much just squished into one movie
Dawg I thought it said the Mew Empire😭😭
I understand giving Kong an axe but the whole power glove thing I feel is the only way to keep making humans part of the relevant plot
Please never stop making these monster movies!
Planet of the Apes meet Transformers?
Sub for trailers ❤
Kong vs Godzilla - New Empire Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes Mad Max - Furiousa Dune II Civil War  Definitely need to start saving up for theatre tickets too much kino coming up this year. We’re eatin good.😎🔥✊🏿
I still can't imagine how Godzilla n Kong gonna beat shimo, i mean shimo itself is like world disaster
Kong didnt evolve but got an SSS+ Item while Godzilla didnt get an item but had a God tier ultra evolution😮🤯🤩
This is insane I got goosebumps during the trailer 😂
Literal chills. You have done it. Now deliver on the movie just as well.
WAS THAT A NUCLESR PALSE
The military attacking godzilla makes me really wonder whats going on there
Does anyone actually give af about the human plotline? Lol
0:31 I saw pink godzilla fighting shimo on the right. But, who actually make blue thermonuclear blasting scar king? Does blue and pink godzilla two diffrent titan? Also pink godzilla use atomic breathe to kong.
I could have swore i heard Richard Ayode in there
I LOVE MONKEY
0:48 I believe that's Mothra
This is the wackiness i loved from the old movies. What a day to be a Godzilla fan.
2:27 shimo in the background
The Internet: Someone explain this in football ⚽ terms  Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing for the same team 😎
Oh my gosh. Who draws this crippled cgi. It's worse than godzilla from 1998 😑😑😒😒😫😫
Not gonna lie i think I just peed a little bit.
This is going to be epic, picking up a gorgeous drunk stripper is epic.😂😂😂😂
Yeh kya bawasir bana diye ho
This will flop.
I am speechless after seeing this trailer, can't wait!!!
Maybe we can see monster zero or hear of him being frozen by Shimu
Kong has grown beard. Cool.
I hope after this movie Toho lets them use destroya
Poor vfc.
Did Godzilla go on a diet?
cgi looks average, and trailer showed me the whole movie in 3 min so moment in the wallet
So epic❤
Hoping Destoroyah is teased at the end.
looks like rgb gaming setup
Team Godzilla X Kong 👇👇
Blue thermo!?
O M F G
So is Space Godzilla confirmed?
Can this be the last Muto movie? Please????
This trailer makes it seem like Godzilla is turning bad.
Whose the villain
CYBER PKONG ...
@0:31 and @2:27 you can see Shimu
The 1st movie sucked. I'm not expecting much.
Fun fact Legendary godzilla hates bridges!😅
Godzilla protector of nature Kong protector of humans
I wonder if Godzillas atomic breath will over power shimus ice beam in a beam clash
I skip all the humans talking in these movies.
"Tight, Tight, Tight! Blue, yellow, pink. Whatever man, just keep bringing me Godzilla!" 🤘
Is that a new zilla??👀😳
I’m so ready the crazier the better
Shimo!
Will flop
This is why cinema was created more than a hundred years ago
Better damn be the return of Ghidora
Didn't they already make this movie? When are they going to think of something new?
2025: Godzilla X Kong X Balenciaga
They need to just go ahead and have Kong and GZ do the epic handshake.
So they’re smart enough to keep Godzilla’s name first but man do these trailers feel like ‘Kong’ movies. ‘Meh’. But anyway… Godzilla is afraid of nothing so they need to get that garbage line out of here…
can not wait
I just hope that godzilla or kong doesn't died in this movie i hope that they make it through being alive but if they died then I will be sad and disappointed because godzilla and kong are my favorite childhood characters.
Why do they keep making this film 🤣
No hate but godzilla 2014 looks bigger then this one even though this one is supposed to be bigger
Tony Stark would've built that gauntlet red
This should have been the trailor from the start!🔥🔥
Eh, more excited for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes
We got Kong with the Infinity Gauntlet and Godzilla Super saiyan Rose fighting against the Beast Titan. This is gonna be epic
2:32 moistcritical scream
agun fura agun
Skar King and Shimu VS Kong and Godzilla! who else is ready?!
Blue thermo is clean
This is perfect. Daarm, and Shimo is huuge. Godzilla looks tiny biting her in the head. 0:30
YOU CAN SEE SHIMO IN THE TRAILER LET'S GOOO
I have high hopes!
Shimoooo
*dies from peak fiction*
Shimu is here
Seriouslyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who else thinks that this is going to be more than likely the BEST Godzilla movie thus far within the monsterverse? looks epic!!
Another great addition to the series. I love it when some movies are just turn your brain off and enjoy the cinematics.
Come on if this movie isn’t a clue to a crossover with pacific rim ,I don’t know…..
This gonna be amazing
They're better bring the other titans into this and we get the titan war. This movie needs to be maxed out!
Kong 0 powers has some massive balls taking on both Scar King and Shimo
Monke
Godzilla can finally emit a nuclear pulse in his blue powered state which I'm mad excited for but it also seems eletrical like as if some of the aftershock of going burning against ghidorah is still there
Monsterverse > Marvel and DC. This is the cinematic universe I'd gladly spend money on
they finally showed Shimu!!!! this movie is going to be off the charts!!
Godzilla running… you need tp stop ruining this franchise right now
Just as long as Godzilla is still the God of the Earth and King of All monsters, I’m good.
My 7 year old son absolutely loves Part 1, his favorite live action movie and he rarely watches anything non animated. Cant wait to take him to see this, might go multiple times. Lets go!
damn it's good!
Big Monke vs Giant red Monke. Big Lizard vs Gigantic ice Lizard.
Yall got some bumble bee on my Kong
In Germany, we call it scheiße
I can't put into words how ridiculous this franchise has become
That was meanest left hook ever
Holy this movie is gonna be crazyyy🔥🔥🔥
Very nice 👍👍👍👍👍
I like Godzilla as a force of nature not some human protector type.I hope this movie doesn't change that
Two or three Godzilla’s?
Shimu Spotted !!!
Dude so theres like 4 kaijus in here. At 0:30. Slow down the video to see it better to pause. So theres like a very pinkish one, a full on ice monster on all fours, Skar king and probably another one in that ice or explosion. Kong cant be in the middle but i have a feeling its Godzilla it just kinda looks like him. Those two others dont make sense because we know thats probably not shimu because he has some pink around him and Godzilla isnt that pink. So honestly kinda confusing
War for the Planet of the Kongs, basically?
Wait so there is another kaju other that the red monkey that we originally thought 👀👀
Thanks for 0 likes 😢
I bet there will still be more scenes of the cast while the monsters get 20 minutes total
Who needs a valentine when you got this trailer?! I can’t wait!
Damn the blue looks so much better than pink
I still don't like pink Godzilla. You could have gotten away with purple, it worked with Shin, but pink? Ew
2:27 mean left hook
King Kong has a gauntlet, I officially need to see this.
THIS. LOOKS. FUN O‘ FUN
Damn I’ve shouldn’t have watched this trailer. Felt like I’ve seen too much 😐
Shimo and Mothra!!!!
W TRAILER!!! SO EXCITED
1:34 that's the boys locker room right there
turning into a cartoon
Looks awful.
Mini Kong rises  🐒🐵
Nah why do I think this duo is like Kev Hart and Dwayne Johnson 💀💀
Can You Put Mothra And Rodan On Their Please?
Written by 12 year olds, for 12 year olds. WTF Fast and Furious/Transformers rip off did just watch?
epico
This looks soooo terrible lol
Hold on there playas we're gonna have ourselves a TAG TEAM MATCH
1:52 Entry of Shimu
Looking fire
For the next movie Kong and Godzilla invades the DC universe
bro what 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
One word: Goosebumps.
0:30 FIRST KING TITAN ON A RIGHT FIGHTING WITH SUPER SAYAN ROSE GODZILLA
At 1:46, what happens ???? Kong is holding the axe in the right hand. Scar kings whip wraps around his left hand.  What exactly happen ? Kong is still holding the the axe. Did the spike on the tip of the whip slice his hand ??
meehhhhhhhh not even gonna watch this stupid movie
India awaites
This looks so 🔥 im hyped
No Way Let's Go
WTFFFF 🥷🏻🔥
vão ter dois godzilas?
Hehehehehe monke
Bro Gojira saw the bridge and the cars and he took that personally
Epic stuff
Much better trailer. Y’all should’ve led with this.
0:31 Shimou's desaing is seen
こういう映画は楽しんだ者勝ちだ These movies are for those who enjoy them.  0:30　Mothra?
En Efecto, Es Cine! 🚬
THIS LOOKS DOPE!!!
cant wait
Waiting to see if King Kong gets hit by a Bolt Of Lightning from a Thunderstorm so he reaches his full potential with his new unstoppable electric power.   🌩️⚡️ 🙊
It's Not A Trailer, it's PURE GOOSEBUMPS!!
❤❤❤❤❤
Old godzilla movie better 👍
I just wanna see Destoroyah and make these movies Dark and Horrifying
2:27 HE CLOCKED THAT MF.
Will it be better then Godzilla minus one ? I seriously doubt it!
Two enemies ...in a same team.....interesting!!
This movie will divide critics and fans, just like Batman v Superman! 😂
I'm busting
THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE SICK
Kong vs Scar king & Godzilla vs Shimo ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Skar and Shimu: Come outside bro I swear we not gonna jump you. Kong: 🤨
Please Show this in IMAX 70MM 😎
Those who say godzilla beats scar king ?
My mind is blown away. I can't wait to see this 🤯🤩✨️❤️
What an excellent trailer cut❤
YES!!! It's time to rumble
So Shimo is there🔥
WHERE IS SHIMO,I WANT TO SEE HER(dont worry i see her)
❤❤❤❤❤
I liked Godzilla 2014 very much. Although Godzilla King of the Monsters was a sillier movie, I thought it was great fun and I loved seeing Mosura, Ghidrah, and Rodan in their Legendary incarnations -- GREAT stuff, even if the human characters and storyline again disappointed. Next, Godzilla vs. Kong was extremely silly, dumb fun, with obnoxious human characters and bad writing, but it featured some truly EPIC showdowns between Godzy and Kong. This one... I'm trying to get excited about it, but the CGI/design looks terrible, and the writing seems aimed squarely at the seven-year-old mindset. I'm expecting it to bomb amid terrible reviews, but this lifelong Godzilla fan hopes to be proven wrong.
RATING 10/10 Sumpah trailer paling keren sih ini ❤
Didn’t they like, already do this three years ago but with extra steps?
Looks like it's gonna be a steaming pile of nonsense. CANT WAIT TO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!! CANT WAIT TO SEE MORE FROM MY MAIN MAN GODZILLA!
Epic
Maybe we'll finally see another legendary dropkick by Godzilla 🤣🤣🤣
This is going to be so cringe and I know im gonna laugh at the theater. Im all for it.
A little touch of Planet of 5he apes
This feels like an Idiocracy movie
Muthaf#$%n..trailiuuuuuh!😂😂
Looks awful.
My only concern as is with all these movies, is the excessive presence of humans as characters as opposed to casualties. I come for monsters not whoever these people are.
Nah that punch from kong at the end was personal😂
Godzilla doing an atomic pulse was  sick
I just glad we got to see Godzilla in nuclear mode again
looks just like pacific rim uprising
I bet the blue ligtning goji is under mind control
Not going to lie, I was slightly concerned with the first trailer….NOW OM BLOODY HYPED!!
My god that looks silly. I'll have to get drunk before going to the theater so I can enjoy it as intended.
Naaahhh im just gonna rewatch minus 1 at this point 💀
I can't wait for this movie its gonna be the best film of the Monsterverse
stupidest thing I have ever seen , can't stop laughing
Why is turning pink a Gozilla power up, is he Goku or stupid?
Valla locura de trailer xd
The death of the interesting, realistic 2014 Godzilla franchise that could have been is now complete. They successfully Michael Bay-d this thing, shame
THEY COOKED ON THIS MOVIE AND TRAILER
This game looks amazing
0:30 Mothra’s Rebirth Revealed!
Teriffic
An injured and almost dead Kong: "I don't need friends, I got family". *Godzilla rising from the background dust*.
We probably just seen the best parts of the movie and the rest will be humans standing around .
You can see shimus face and tail before kong punches skar king on the right side of the screen if you slow it down
Apes together strong.....er with Thanos Gauntlets
Trailers need to do a better job of not showing the entire movie. No need to go see it now
So who are scar and shimo?
PEAKKK
Let's go Kong 🦍🦍 I can't wait
What a strange trailer.. Who thought the webcam screaming effect was a good Idea?
Who let them cook
2:53  Ishiro Honda and Edgar Wallace.
Essa batalha no Rio vai ser irada demais!
So excited, this is going to be epic and amazing.
godzilla got some type of nuclear pulse again??
Please scar king have a fighting style similar to that of mma or martial arts in general.also based on this trailer scar king is either the same size or a marginally taller than kong but thin compare to kong,which make him less stronger,but i hope scar king is more powerful and refined in his skills.
Hype! Glad to see Godzilla & Kong together again! 💪🏆
I'm assuming skar can use mind control
Funny how a Human can dictate what a giant kaju is afraid of smh😂
We need this trailer to do well
Wooooooooo
wow! we can see Shimo!
Minor Spoiler. Set playback to 0.25 and pause at 0:31. You can see kong, scar king, Godzilla and shimo fighting in the same scene.
Good, now I'm excited.
They showed way too much 😢
This is the first movie done completely with AI
Skar: fight with me, kong. Kong: i will not. Skar:..... Cool. Kong:  ...why.... did you say it like that?
OMG 😳😳
Those screams sounds like penguinz0.
Wow... So finally  Godzilla and kong going to Join Avengers  Team.....Coz Thanos is coming back....😂😂😂😂
Im ngl this trailer got me hype. More monsters and Kong isnt alone. Now we need a Blue Werewolf Kaiju so i can have rampage at home... but with chef ramsey cooking the meal.
KONGZILLA❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥🔥🔥
This fells so wrong... another titans movie about titans and not humanity ...
WAIT SHIMU IS A GAINT GODZILLA?
Kong really said I got to fight dis big ahh orangutan and this big ahh mint bubblegum lizard
Damn that punch was personal..🦍
It's absolute nonsense, but I love every bit of it! Let's go!
Like for the 3 trailer
1:13 & 2:33 - Wooooooooooooo, yeaaaah baby, that's what i've been waiting for, that what it's all about.
💔 video game banadiya is baar #hurts😢
I KNEW SHIMU WOULD BE IN THE MOVIE
Penguinz0 screaming
*LONG LIVE, THE KING!* 👑🔥
Kong is gonna kick that scarkings butt
0:31 if you pause right here you can see Godzilla and shimo to the right
shimu is here letss goooo
Rip deadpool!
Why?😢
THIS IS SOMETHING WE CALLED ' PEAK CINEMA '🔥🔥🔥 🦍💪🏻
Shimo !!! Finally
lol this is so Heisei and millenium influenced my inner child jumps with joy
Kong in Rio de Janeiro! THAT IS LIT 🔥
Ironically all the people who make this movie possible are W men. Another wokebroke thing to not pay for.
Godzilla afraid??? Nope, sorry, no.
DAN STEVENS FINE SELF 😍😍😍😍🤤🤤🤤🤤
1:26 distorted moistcritical woo
LET’S GO, BABY!!!
CGI trash. I can not believe anyone above 10 would find this entertaining.
1:50 kongs face when he saw shimo definitely says "oh f me", can't wait to see shimo and scar king
Lit
Mothra? 😢
In monkey and lizard we trust
*1:53** Shimo? 🤔*
1:43 💥💥💥💥💥
Lizard 🦎 gorilla 🦍
Feels too cliche
CGI looks awfully bad.
HOLY GUACAMOLY
How do I make a Trashcan Emoji?  #Godzillaminusone!
Looks dope!
The King of monsters 🔥🔥
WAIT WHAT THIS YEAR
Slow the trailer down to 0.25 and pause at 2.26 frame by frame you see at middle right side of the screen(right beside Skar King's head), that's Shimo, very clearly
King of the Monsters was the last great Godzilla movie
Suoer Saiyan Rose Godzilla lets goo
kong smacked the tooth outta that orangutan lmao
Funny trailer 😅
King Kong and Godzilla movies these days look childish asf why they so weak
We have officially reached Fast & Furious levels of silliness with this franchise and I'm NOT here for it. Might as well label this as a cartooon.
Ww2 be like 💀💀💀💀
OH NOOOOOOOOO
This movie looks sick!! I really hope it's 3+ hours long 🍿
Theory: that “Signal” is actually coming from Mothra
Kong and Godzilla together reminds me of Zoro and Sanji..
This would be much better if the enemy hadn't been leaked by toy brands lmao
That was insane yo
oh nah, the hype is gon murder me
HOLY DID GODZILLA JUST PULSE?
Bruh you gave Kong a Winter soldier arm wtf
Hsus
I couldn't tell if this was planet of the apes x fast and furious or wha?!
My parents: awww cute! he's playing with his toys!  My 5 year old imagination:
My goodness… looks insane
Skipping this trash  version of a movie.
Keren ini sih
Yee movie oor Godzilla movie yo koi gand faad degi
0:30 IT'S MOTHRA!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Put it on low speed)
Guys don't you think the CGI stuff could have been layered more.. especially in the first  scene where zilla meets Kong...and then together....
It's kongin' time.
2:37 Mothra Egg ?
These movies look better and better with each entry
am i tweaking or i saw pink and ice godzilla in right side 0:30
Omala kola massu💥🔥🔥 Kong Thalaiva⚡

Kaam he yaar ye movie tooo pakkaa
Godzilla : No matter how many times I save the world , people still bombing me 👍🏻
now i want trailer 3
And at the end they Godzilla and Kong go "PREDATOR" Mode "You son of a *****"
Yooooo 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥 see Hollywood can make a good movie. Just don't have dumbass running these companies and go back to the basics
Oh yes I think they will teleport in time to kill thanos but where are the other avengers tho🤔
🔥🔥
Not only Kong, but Godzilla has an ice shooting adversary too. I'M WAY MORE HYPED. Such a kickass trailer!! Absolutely LOVE the Titan politics bringing Godzilla and Kong on the same team. It looks so vibrant and Kong with the mecha glove was so badass!! 11:55pm
I think i heard scream from moistcritikal when godzilla released the EMP
CMON GIVE US SPACE GODZILLA  or jet jaguar
Bruh
They made Kong , Doomfist. Pass on this, Minus One was amazing, I cant stand these American Godzilla films.
I want to see that movie 🍿
Kong got bumbkebees arm and Godzilla acheived super sayain Rose
This looks incredible! I’m so excited!❤ can’t wait!
This is going to be so stupid, but so incredibly fun. I love it
NAH GODZILLA GOT THAT V2, AND KONG GOT SKIPPED ALL THE WAY TO HIS V3 BRO I SWEAR😂
At 0:28 go at the slowest speed and you can see mothra in jia's eyes
I am waiting for this legendary masterpiece ❤🎉🎉
We will be there NO MATTER WHAT!!!!
ESTÁ TREMENDO AHHGGGG ASUPTM ASUMAKINA 🤟💥!!!!!
Just stop…. Please
I hope there is very little human scenes . We just want to see titans fight nothing else
1:50  " oh dear god what now? "  Its probably what kong would say
Why did they take away blu :(
That eyes looks like shimu's.....
Who is that other monkey?
I'm still bothered by them moving so fast. They're so giant they should move slowly. I'll still watch tho.
Team GODZILLA ❤❤
Don't normally watch stuff like it but this just made my day.
Kong and suko punching skar king is gold😂2:27
This is very epic omg I already want to see this movie with my Godzilla collectible figure 😊
Never thought i would see a day which kong and godzilla run alongside each other❤
One more month guys! Let's go!!!!!
Oh wow I can’t wait…🥳
Esses carioca são muito burro oh, tão vendo oque vai acontecer no Rio e não evacuam
happy to see the monsterverse is making good movies 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I haven't seen Godzilla this angry since King Ghidorah MUTO Prime and Mechagodzilla
Part 1 and 2 had a bit of realism to it this just threw common sense out the door.
Let’s goo 🔥 🔥
Who in thier right mind wants to watch this after minus one?
That looks absolutely 🔥
I come for monkee. I leave now.
❤❤
Who cares about the human, just let the monster fight
This might be the Movie of the Year
WTF 🎉🎉🎉
That was a much better trailer
Ah, another dead horse back to be flogged once again.
Alright as cool as this crossover is, am i the only one that thinks they pussied out major with not choosing a clear winner in Godzilla vs King Kong? I Think Godzilla should have won it with mortaly wounding but not killing Kong. Then they would have a storyline where Kong now follows Godzilla as the true Apex and they still work together. I mean i would have even been ok with kKng winning and activly sparing Godzilla showing his inteligence cause he sees him as a potential ally and than he calls for Godzillas loyalty in this movie. Just any definite decision of who is stronger.
Damn,Kong threw a catastrophic punch at Skar King
Damn kong with the infinity gauntlet and godzilla with the SSJ rose transformation...oh ya I'm all in, I bet the enemy will be Zamasu 😂
A Blue thermo godzilla awesome 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Now I remember why I gave up on the American Films
Sooo hype for this
You can't watch trailers nowdays. They give everything away. Did we need to know he was going to use a gauntlet, for example? Producers are too afraid people on go see their stuff ending up showing cool details that would work better if we didn't know.
This looks goofy asf but I’m here for it 😂 only trailer I’ve seen in months that’s got me interested
Shimo in tha house!
Dope af! Definitely gonna be better than madame web
Center of the Planet of the Apes
Kong: "Yo, God. How much do we want to exaggerate?" - Godzilla:  "YYYYYYEEEEEESSSS!!!!!" :D
Adter watching Godzilla Minus One, this movie seems completely stupid
Same as Jurassic park, planet of the apes and that Marvel shite….. just taken it too far!
Kong face is probably when he sees the apes
This is sick. I can’t wait.
Que buen tráiler csmr
2:26 Kong knocked Scarking down for hurting mini kong😂
This is sooo Great!!!
I'd rather re-watch 'Godzilla Minus One'.
Finally!!!
Oh my goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
2v2 is sick
Yesss sirrrr this gonna be a badass movie!!!!
Did I just see Godzilla running?! 😮
In the 1st underworld battle, Kong wins over Scar King, but then Scar king escapes into some cave and when Kong chases King to the cave, something else appears, very large and powerful, which is Shimo, who freezes Kong's arm, making him need BEAST Gloves in the future.
Im here for all the kaiju epicness!!
Godzilla, Kong, Skar King, and Shimo. The big 4. Here we go!
That rose Zilla under water shot 🥵🔥
GOD DAMN IT!!!! JUST TAKE MY MONEY NOW!!! IM GONNA GO SEE THIS IN THEATERS!!!!
they really not wanting us to see mothra yet
Bruv is that mothra in the girls eyes at :30
...why....
I was a big hater of the newer stuff but after seeing how stupidly over-the-top this is, im a fan. This looks so frikkin sick 💀💀💀
TEAM: G X K HeRe
Wowwwwwwww team Godzilla ☄️💙💓
Godzilla afraid? Nah fam
Looks like the Team up from 1972 Movie Godzilla and Jet Jaguar😂
I didn't like it.
OMG!!!!! YES!!!!!!
This has to be the best Godzilla & Kong movie we have ever saw. This is going to be fire, I can’t wait to see it!!!!
I can wait to watch the movie now🍿
Imagine the news:”A man was killed by a titan’s tooth crashing from the sky”!😂
Godzilla and Kong are more powerful than we thought ❤️‍🔥☠️
idk maybe this type of stuff aint for me but I found this trailer incredibly cringe and felt no sense of stakes here. Everything is just too marvel-ish and not in a good way.
This might be the best trailer of GodZilla n King Kong I've ever seen
Women do not get that haircut every time I see it it just looks so bad...
why people saying the shimo entrance was cold it was just 2 eyes bro and how is the cgi looking a bit wierd in a trailer  it looks like a marvel movie and why would kong protect humans we dont protect ants and he looks bigger than godzilla and im sorry the pink does not suit godzilla waht so ever
Same old same old
Dissapointed as scar king wont fight with godzilla-(kotm)
I think i watched the whole damn movie😆😂
RELEASE COYOTE VS. ACME!!
This is gonna be epic❤❤
I really hope Mothra returns in this movie
Kong a mf beast
Thank God all my questions are answered 🤙🏻
Epicccccccc
Given that they're really tight lipped about Shimo, then it must be a bigger deal than even Skar King.
Gawt damn! That was awesome!!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH STAAAAAHHHHHPPP ITTTT
Bro godzilla look sick at 0:51 and kongs iron arm looks so cool I'm excited for this movie it looks so good, and him fighting scar king is even better.
❤️❤️❤️
This is a great trailer
This trailer looks incredible!!!!  I definitely plan on checking this out in the theatre and talking about it on my YouTube channel.  Kind of a bummer that  Millie Bobby Brown isnt going to be in it like previous movies.  IMO the first Godzilla x Kong movie was the movie of the year by far.  With this movie, the Godzilla: Minus One movie, and the Monarch tv show.. there is a lot of Godzilla going on right now.  So awesome!!! 😀👍
Why
OMG!!!!! YES!!!!!!
When do they kiss? The film is called Godzilla X Kong.
Seems like kong faces Scar King and Shimo in Hollow Earth then meets Godzilla in Egypt
This looks really lit,especially the Pinkzilla.
Bhaisaaaaaaaaa😮
Most badass part of seeing kong nock out a tooth from skar king
THIS S%#$ GON BE HOT! IT'S GON BE HHOOOOOOOOTTTT!
OMG!!!!! YES!!!!!!
Барби и Кент идут в Рио дать по морде всем кто против моды! У Шимо лёд, у Шрама хлыст... Ребята не ваш уровень у нас тут два гламурных и брутальных ублюдка с Перчаткой и Ядерным пуком. Вы думаете, что у вас есть шансы? Они в прошлый раз друг другу наваляли, а потом на пару протрезвев разобрали Десептикона с лазерами...
........😐 qué mamadas
1:50 Kong's face hahaha that's going to become a meme I'm sorry xd
@Warner Bros. Pictures i wish u could make the monster verse cross over with pacific rim that would be cool and jsut in case u ever do make another godzilla  and kong movie in the future i know the perfect bad guy they can face he is super strong so godzilla and kong might need space godzilla for this one in 2026 or 2025
Kong: I don't like you and you hate me but we both hate him  Godzilla: agreed
Oh yeah 🤩🤩
this looks so stupeid but so good!
All i seen from this was Kong. Barely Godzilla so disappointing😢
WACK!! 👎👎👎
Beautiful no other word for it
After seeing Godzilla Minus One and the Japanese reminding me of why I fell in love with Godzilla in the first place, my tolerance for a pink Godzilla teaming up with his arch nemesis to save the world again is very low. This is cookies and milk.  Minus one is jack Daniels and street tacos. (I’m hungry)
All the influencers 😂
Ayo Kong been mewing
Man ... I DO like the Godzilla movies ... even the first Godzilla vs Kong ... but this?!?!?! 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
A most epical battle of titanic proportion!  Here. We. Go.
I'm looking forward to seeing Jia again.
Planet of the ape🎉
Imagine people actually buying a movie ticket for this garbage
Human life in Monster verse - Here we go again. Our population gonna drop & Tax Up.🙃
2:27 I thought it was a crab's pincer then I realized it was Skar-King's tooth. That punch was personal. 😂
While Marvel is trying to crawl back up to its glory days, legendary's giving us a Kaiju Lethal weapon. SWEEET!!!!
Тупое говно для тупого говна ! )
Let the bloody war begin
Ok, ok i see it, much better trailer than the 1st one, so Scar King isn't the only threat that our "king duo" will have to face, ice powers...hmm that's cold (lol sorry).
Are you guys really ready for this??
What a great movie. Glad I watched it.
Please let then running together be a dream sequence.
YOOOOOOO (im hyped af.)
THERMO GODZILLA 2.0!?!?!!?
THIS IS THE NEW SHOWA ERA GODZILLA
Eh... kinda looks wack
This is becoming very cartoonish but I'mma still going to watch it. 🤣🤣🤣
Can’t wait too see this
2:27 kong punch is just 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Im not straight
Kong: Murderer!
Yeaaa!!! It's finally happening
Does anyone feel that is a video game more than a movie ?!
In the eye of the girl is mothra
the trailer give the vibe from that ripoff Pacific Rim the movie and i have some bad feeling about this
Shimo is here!!!!
❤❤
This is gonna be epic, eager to watch them on screen❤.
Peak is coming
Gotta see it
Okay I'm in. Sold
this is FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
woaaa
Finally a real trailer
This movie is going to be more epic than Godzilla vs Kong!!! 👏🏻👏🏻
Those visuals do look impressive
at 0:31 we get just a single frame of shimo, pink godzilla, kong and scar king in the same city, and there seems to be some kind of blue radiaton coming from the ground. BTW YOU MUST SLOW THE VIDEO DOWN OR HAVE GOOD REFLEXES TO CATCH THESE FRAMES.  and godzilla also seems to be in some sort of BLUE-THERMO mode its probably before he goes PİNKMODE tho.
I hate youtube comments...
Oh
WAIT if you guys slow it down to 0.25 at 0:31 you’ll see godzilla fighting shimo but you’ll also see a pulse at where kong is, MY BOY FINALLY GETTING HIS POWERS
That looks great
This looks terrible in my opinion.
2:13 Ooooh a slight 75° angled sky beam, movies truly are evolving!
By the next movie I want Godzilla and Kong to dap each other up Arnold and Carl Weathers in Predator.
1:14 meme material
Wowwww🤯🤯
amazingggggg🔥🔥
That gauntlet took me back to 2019 theaters🙃
Transfers 10 into savings account for the end march😉
We all know who it is 1:45
Lol, this felt like a big april fools joke. I was honestly busting out laughing while watching this. Godzilla running like a humanoid, kong having that powerfist. Like wtf? Man this will be braindead popcorn cinema on sharknado levels. 🤣🤣🤣
GODZILLA Minis One Forever!!!!!! Who is ready For Part 2!!!!
At you can see When Kong pounch scarking shimu was there wachin
So shimo is in the trailer a fight scene a rematch a new Godzilla power and when Kong knocks scar kings tooth out I thought he used his beast glove but I rewatched and realised that he used his other hand dang it looks like Godzilla ain’t the only one who has evolved #TeamGodzilla
2:13 shimo 😬🔥
El color rosa es de geis 🗿🚬
In this story, it was Kong who was burned, what could he do alone against Shimu and Scar King, but the poor thing only wanted bananas and a comfortable life on his island 😅
Thiss movie is gonaa be insane
Monke and Lizard vs. Monke and Lizard: The Movie
WTF....As a director this looks very bad!! From the inconsistent sizes of the two! And the poor story line. What is the point of this movie???
Planet of the kongs 😅 lol looks fire 🔥
I'm just waiting for Godzilla minus one to come out on bluray to get my monster fix in.
Man this looks terrible. Fast and the Furious with Monsters.
Cine 🗿
If Godzilla doestn do his Nuclear Flying Drokick, im going to be disapoint
Whaat, did they really make the gauntlet for Kong 😂
Damn. I'm.So.Hyped™
🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥🌤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥🔥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is ridiculous, but I’m here for it. Lol
My all time favourite movie ❤❤❤
Lesss gooo giant monke and the big lizard working together to face the greater enemy pinnacle of fiction nothing comes close
🦖🦖🦖
I love Kong’s confidence face after he punches back King Skar’s spine whip with the glove. It looks so awesome!!! 🦍🦍 👊
Why is this vin Diesel and rock ?
meh...
YOOOOO LETS GOOOOO!!!!
I swear I just finished watching planet of the apes, opened youtube and saw this trailer drop😂, is this a sign? are they about to takeover us?😂
Kong holding back shimu's breathe that was dope
Curious George CONFIRMED?!? 1:23
Huge improvement over the first trailer. March 29 needs to get here sooner.
"The last time those 2 met up, it was almost the end of Kong".  FACTS 😅😅😅😅
Let them cook
Woww❤❤❤
Team Kong🔥
This looks ridiculous.  I love it.
This documentary looks so good.
This film looks the dogs bollocks I can’t wait to see it
Ok I ain’t going to lie this movie is going to be the best from legendary for ages
Woke liberals overran this movie too 🤦‍♂️ how sad 😞
I don't know how to feel about this, it feels generic, I hope the whole movie won't be like that.
Letsgo
Yay
0:30 mothra in the eyes
I feel like this what Japan had in mind for the later Showa era films they just didn’t have the budget or tech to do it. Bonkers Im here for it!
Now we need Is Pacific Rim vs Godzilla and Kong
Thanos and super sayian rose agaisnt Scorpion and sub zero lizard, this will be epic 🍿🍿
I absolutely loved Godzilla 2014, i really enjoyed Gozilla King of Monsters....but this looks like it's made for 1st graders...
Love trailers that show basically the entire movie
But Godzilla one of the most powerful
0:30 Shimo vs Godzilla
I got exams when the movie releases but fk that, ain't nothing going to stop me from watching this.
TAKE MY FUNDS NOW
Let’s gooo!! Old vs new! They got this
This trailer was much better to see as Kong fan. More detail on that gauntlet he's rocking. Kong and godzilla standing tall at the end was straight beastly
Transformers bumblebee looking hand
I'm not saying it doesn't look cool. But they really had something with the more gritty, dark versions of these and soon as those remakes made money, they made it goofy looking and a buddy comedy
Oww 😮
Hopefully there's not another Millie Bobby Brown side quest in this one. Worst part of the last movie.
Shimo entrance was cold 💀🔥
This is actually fire wtf
This movie looks bonkers and makes absolutely no sense. ... It's everything I could have hoped for! <3  LET'S GOOOOOOOOO!
i dont get it. whos fighting who?? why is there double doubles but different fighting each other? one thing is for sure. the orangutan is the antagonist!
Definitely gonna be watching this when it comes out, This looks insane 😄😄
Can’t Wait 😮
Piadinhas a la marvel/disney, o que criaturas como kong e zilla deveriam ser monstros, elementos da própria natureza, se tornaram uma versão "monstra" dos vingadores. Nah, eu passo.  O último filme realmente interessante sobre monstros foi o "Minus One". Esse aí tá mais pra uma piada genérica de hollywood.
They are really back
So this series will just be fast and the furious buddy cop
this is gonna be awesome.
This is going to be fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️
Now this is going to be awesome, and I'm wondering if Scar King is commanding the monster that's breathing the ice-like breath to destroy Kong and Godzilla.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
INGATUROÑA
Minus One was better than the all US franchise😂
Gonna be a great buddy cop film
They need to cut that running scene with Godzilla.  Lmao!!!!
The King bows to no one 😤
I would have liked to see more of Shimo aside from just eyes and far away shots, but hey, I’ll take it
Team Kong 🦍
Is that Mothra in Jia's eyes?
Look like a PS5 Game
I don't like Kong since they have same size with Godzilla
shimu father of all kaijus
Just WoW😮😮😮😮😮💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥🔥
They gave Kong a sliver fang 😮❤
Ngl scar King look smaller than kong
I'm super much excited to watch this movie in theatres.  Godzilla & Kong duo fire... 🔥🔥
Fazer questão de ver o filme no Rio de Janeiro
I love when Warner Bros bring something like this. They are just great at CGI which looks promising and makes the movie experience totally admirable.
TRAILER 2 BABY!!! GODZILLA VS SHIMU!!!
I can't be the only one who watched that more than once
Kong vs gOZILLA, Kingdom of planets of apes. The apes about take over your theatress...
at 0:31 you see GZ and Shimo fighting on the right side of the screen too. Both powered up in Pink/Blue.
2:20-   me during group projects in college 😂
I’m the only one who thought that the thing after kong punch was a crab claw? Now I’ve understand that is a Scarking’s teeth 😂
This looks so monumentally stupid and dumb. Is going to be awesome. Can't wait to turn off my brain to watch this in cinema
Its so funny😂 what a cringe movie
Godzilla afraid...................... is that a joke?
Goosebumps
God Pls let Godzilla do the nostalgic flying kick 🦵 I swear I would scream in the theatres
YEAH!!!! TRAILER 2 IS EPIC!!
Why is this so fire 😭
Hope thy focus on both Kong and zilla equally ... Rather than giving importance to Kong like last time
Now we just need Toho to announce a Minus One sequel and live as a Godzilla fan will be almost perfect.
Godzilla Saiyan Rose and Kong with Infinity Gauntlet facing off against King Louie and Ice King’s Beast….         MONSTROUSLY AWESOME! 🦖♦️🤛🦍🐍🦧🦕❄️
CCCAAAAAARAAAALHOOOOOOOO QUA FODA, tô muito ansioso
badass
The colours look so gorgeous
The obnoxious humans always make american godzilla movies lame
Finally shimu is coming
So the way this is gonna work is Godzilla will fight shimu and kong will fight scar king
Oooooomfggg SHIMOOOO
Kong: "I am Kong"  Gojira: "Subarashi"
Y shimu??? Quiero ver a shimu
Story is meh...but Im here for the thrill of the ride...thats it. Switching off my brain on March 29th
Who and what is a shimo?
I still love old Godzilla movie 🍿😅
I swear to god that screaming sound effect is an altered moist critikal “WOOOOOOOOO YEAH BABY”
So stupid I love it
And I guess burning Godzilla is now Blue too? Since blue fire is hotter
I think they are hiding the main villain from us
2:27 DAMN Skar King Got DROPPED
Hype
This is gonna be awesome af!!! I cannot wait!!!
It’s pretty cool how Godzilla and Kong aren’t friends still, idk I like their rivalry lol
So nobody gonna say how epic the music was for this trailer I swear I hear Godzilla in the choirs lines 😅
"They don't have to like each other. They just have to work together"  Brilliant original writing
Ps4 graphics looks better than this CGI
this looks so dumb I'm in
Seems like King Ghidorah is not so dangerous and scary, the Scar King is seemed to introduce more fear and danger. But Ghidorah definitely almost conquered a whole planet..
I feel like with all these powerups, I think they're preparing both for the arrival of Destoroyah  (the thanos of monsteverse)
Quando eu vi o kong segurando um laser pensava que era outro Godzilla mais na verdade e o shimo
I have always wanted to watch godzilla/kong movie in theater..this is my chance 😃😃
Bro I can't wait for this film it's gonna be epic
Yes
💥
This looks like trash. Sorry
Hopefully we don't get a 90 minutes movie witch 80 minutes of it are just humans.
am i the only one who thought the soundwaves warbling was penguinz0 going woooo yeah baby?
This looks bad
0:30 you see Mothra in her eye ;)
YEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
Ain't no way skar king is gonna be a threat 😭 if this mf kong can hit skar king with 1 punch and he loses a tooth then I don't see a real problem here
I’m so excited
Wait, does this mean Kong technically isn’t a Titan? If his species is considered the Great Apes and listed separately from the Titans.
Already seeing too much of the unfunny marvel dialogue humans
Not good we want to see Kong as kong and Godzilla as gozila
LEEeeeeeEEEeTTtTTtTT FfFFFFRRRRRIiiiiiiiiiiiKkkkkkkkkkkkqiiiiiiiiiiiNnnnnnnnnnnnGhggggggg GGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOO!
I’m tired of seeing Kong getting disrespected again and again bruh 😞
Ain't no way kong just disrespected Lanky Kong w that knockout 😂
2:50 clean punch
Fu##$% Rio for that Jesus statue, No one would ever try to destroy Brazil if it weren't for that thing
I am hype! I am super ready for this movie, along with my mom, sister, and my dad. Me, my sister, and my mom are true Godzilla fans and we like both monsterverse and Toho Godzilla movies and series and my dad is a true Kong fan, but he watch Godzilla with us. Looks like Godzilla did evolved while he still has the his blue, color. Also it looks like Godzilla has a new power when he still has that blue color, I wonder he will have that power when he is pink. This movie is gonna be epic! Bring it on, Monsterverse!
Mothra is back. Can't wait to see the biggest massive team in history of cinema industry.  Long live the MONSTERVERSE.
Nope! Looks wonky 😂
is there 2 godzillas? at 29 seconds slow it down to .25 speed. and you see godzilla going almost nuclear but blue, and the frame right after has the pink godzilla fighting shimu, either its two scenes that arent the same part and there blended, or theres 2 godzillas
If you slow down the video to 0.25 speed at 30 seconds you can see Godzilla tackling Shimo      Neat
Fun fact that crews of the first Godzilla film once lost and ends up on the set of Planet of the Apes, now Planet of the Apes exist in a Godzilla movie
Looks so good will be my first time going to the movie theater since Spider-Man no way home
Pack a punch kong and zilla before gta 6
Damm cool 💀
Nope. I'm out. This is not my Godzilla.
Scar king: con que queriendo evadir inclinarse eh 😡   Kong: está pelón * se ríe* 😂
Kong ❌ Thanos ✅😂 💀🗿
Omg this is amazing
This is going to be epic!
monke lore
They are turning it into marvel now
this movie is gonna be the coolest movie of the year
Is Millie Bobby Brown in it??
You can see Shimo at least twice in this trailer if you slow it down and Mothra in Gia’s reflection
I'm not sure if I should go to work tomorrow after Skar King destroyed our building with his Whipslash.
Just epic...
These movies keep getting more and more stupid with each release... And I love all of it anyway 😂
2:27, that punch was really personal 🦍💪🏻🔥👑
Where is Millie Bobby Brown 🤔
2:27 Scar got  HUMBLED
Wtf they are doing with monsters.
Idc if ppl complain, this looks AWESOME!!!🤩🦍🐉🦧❄️
I just realized that Skar-King and Shimo may be dark reflections of our title heroes whom are portrayed in a hopeful light. Kudos to Adam and the team!
wow
1.51 at this trailer Kong reaction is priceless. Kong is scared of shimo
So basically.. good guy monkey and good guy Kaiju vs bad guy monkey and bad guy kaiju
Kong face when he saw shimo was like "Aint no way they got me squaring up with this big ahh ice breaker"💀
Feels like i just saw the whole movie thanks
The last roar of kong and godzilla says it all❤❤
I am not watching this until we get HD quality
this trailer looks so cool i hope the movie doesn't flop
ACTUAL SPOILER,, U COULD LITERALLY GODZILLA ND SHIMO FIGHTING IN 0.30 SEC IF U OAUSE CAREFULLY WITH SKAR IN THE CENTRE OF THE FRAME
Epic trailer! And i like how they didn't show too much, they're probably preparing us for something big! I'm so exciteeeed!!!
goofy asf and i’m here for it
I'm likely in the minority but I haven't liked any of these since Skull Island 😂
Show less humans
Godzilla is in atomic state 0:55
Epic🤩
Now this is a trailer 👌🏾
Finally, very excited for this film
It just looks so silly and you can tell the script was written in about 5 minutes
10 years ago we had the very grounded godzilla (2014). How exactly did we get here?
PEAK!
All I’m saying is that it better be 90% Monster fights and 10% human screen time
I can’t wait to see the movie when it comes out in theaters.
Welcome Shimu 🤓
So Skar King and Shimo.....ARE ACTUALLY GETTING ALONG?!?!
Dude if we get more boring BS human plot lines it’s gonna be us just waiting for the next fight like pretty much every monsterverse film
Tbh I just want the G man and the king to be friends
When has a giant ape ever exist? Mighty Dinosaurs ruled the Earth and were the only giant's. Were ape's are no larger than human's. Anyway I'm here for Godzilla ps I spotted the statue of Cesare Borgia Jesus not the real Prophet 😂
Hollywood executives whenever want a movie sequel to be successful, they throw the word "Empire" in the title.
Kong will collect all the infinity stones
3:00 3:00 3:00 3:00 3:00  omg
Anyone else notice how King Kong one punched scar kings tooth out with his none augmented fist 👊
This is how you do a trailer!
Who is more powerful kong or Godzilla
Kong continues to ride Godzilla's shirt tails.
Ha sido el mejor 14 de febrero de toda mi vida gracias Godzilla y Kong
So ugly wtf, it's insane to release this in 2024 ! 🤮
About time for a decent crossover
Seeing this trailer is like I've watched the real stuff 😮
This is the Best trailer i ever see
2:26-2:27 on the right, that's clearly Shimo as she's fighting Godzilla, for anyone wanting a glimpse besides her eyes and frost beam.
can't wait
Remember when the monsterverse was grounded in a somewhat reality? We’re really close to jumping the shark here.
2:27 you see Shimo on the right side of the screen.
Guantelete del infinito en King Kong
damnnn
Warner bros is really makin' good use of their stock trailer SFX pack they got on discount
lets gooo
This is crazy ❤❤❤
I’m actually speechless!! This is going to be a great movie!!!!!!
wish the ultraman brothers will appear 😅
Caraca, a quanto tempo um filme não me deixava hypado, trailer delicioso!
Where's mothra, she is going to be in the movie, she should be featured in the next trailer
un-special effects
Topppd+++++
Put it on slow mo, WHY THE F IS GOdZILlA A BLuE NuCLEAr VARIEBT 0:30
Can't wait anymore more can we !!!
You can be a divided fan but me? Imma enjoy the new Godzilla content we’re getting recently. I like legendary Godzilla and minus one. Sue me
GODZILLA CAN FREAKING PULSE THIS IS GOING TO BE FRICKING EPIC
The ships gonna be crazy 🍷 🗿
why did you have to make them run together side by side in center frame? why?!?!?!
OH YUH
Skar king looks goofy asf
This looks SO BADASS!!!!
Rampu ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🥵🥵
This movie going to be an huge success i sure 💫🔥
Did you just show the entire movie? Anyway, the thumbnail makes Godzilla and Kong look like Monsterarts toys lol! I thought it was gonna be a toy review before I clicked and saw it's a new trailer!🤣🤣🤣
Haven’t been to the movie theaters in awhile , but this movie is worthy of an IMAX viewing.
Can’t wait for the fights 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Can't wait to see useless and wannabe funny human characters stealing time in a monsters movie once again!!! 😍
Now both evolved and Blue nuclear pulse mv Godzilla can surely stand a chance against the strongest japanese godzillas
Is this stupid? Yes. Is this over the top? Yes. Will this get panned by critics? Yes  But am I still absolutely excited? YES.
just go frame by frame
2:43 New Doomfist skin in OW2. Looks like blizzard has done it again, another awesome cross over!
I think I'm even more excited than I was for GvK!! Can't wait to see it!!
Spoiler alert everywhere.
SHOW US SHIMO🗣🗣🗣
THE CGI LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER. good job legendary
I don't know why they are using pink colour 😅
Oh nah, the funny battle commentary channels are gonna have a field day with this movie.
found it at 0:30
Kong challenging Shimo and Scar even when he lost to Godzilla is the most KONG thing ever!
This is the freakin greatest Kong-Zilla movie..
0:31 here kong vs scar king & godzila vs shimu i guess..!!
Myr saanam.. 😂👍🏼
Wow even on valentines day 😊
Now that's how a trailer should be made! Makes me wanna watch this movie even more now!!
super sayian rose godzilla and super sayian blue full power godzilla
Bro did godzilla have ghidora aura ???? 2:34
Why trailers are so informative?
#ContinueTheMonsterVerse
Godzilla and shimu are shown fighting at 0:31 while Kong and skar king fight in the city and shimu is massive
I may not be a kong fan but that punch ( 2:27 ) was chef's kiss
Shimo 💪🏼🥶
Incredible 😳🔥
Goku and Vegeta
IT'S MOTHRA'S EGG AAAAAAAA!!!!!!!
This is going to be so crazy in the best way. Really excited!
2027 will be: Godzilla x Kong: Draymond Green
It looks like Godzilla at the beginning will go berserk because he feels Shimo's presence, and in the end Godzilla and Kong will experience a misunderstanding because Godzilla feels that Kong in Hollow Earth is causing chaos, but in the end they will work together after Skar King and Shimo rampage on the surface 🤣🤣  BTW, the scene where Kong hits Skar King and his teeth fall out is really epic
Ohh my god can't wait
Kongzila
They keep revealing this much in these trailers it’ll save me a trip to the movies 😅
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Monsterverse trailers are always so hype, I’m in the theater day one this is so fire!🔥🔥🔥
Gidorah is coming
Amazing super
Godzilla’s finally got the Spiral Atomic Breath!!! I’m ready!!!
im in
Looks awesome.. BUT again with the trend to show too much
I’m hyped!!!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wait, there's not a skybeam, but now a waterbeam?  And they make a MechaKong, but not a MechaGodzilla?  Expectations SUBVERTED.
The only series you cannot dislike
Kong & Zilla is like Jordan & Kobe😮‍💨🔥
Hi
Other Godzilla ?😮
History is made again.
the entire script is people saying "signal" or "oh my god"
Why does that roar kinda sound like the Penguinz yell meme 💀💀
Omg omg it's the women from monarch legacy!! Kiko was there !!! Unless the little girl grew up in days.... The adult Asian lady was kiko slow it down and look 💯💯💯💯💯
This is empty money
#ReleaseCoyotevsAcme
🔥🔥🔥
God damn it this looks awesome
Lets get this number 1 at trending
Godzilla does not run
Yes!!!!!!!! Can't wait to see this! This is gonna be EPIC!!!
Badass trailer ever 🔥
i dont know if any of you knowticed this but if you go frame by frame you can see shimu scar king and godzilla fighting im not sure if kong is there since its low quality but still pretty awsome💯
No Millie bobby brown, thank god
It is not important that MONKE ALWAYS LOSES!  The more important thing is that MONKE ALWAYS SURVIVES!
Yeah I can’t wait for this!!! Godzilla’s electric charge at 2:33 looks insane…
If you go to the time 0:31 you can see shifu of whatever his name is and theroize, pls give me shout out!
I GOTTA SHOW MY MOM
THIS LOOKS SICKKK
Godzilla vs Kong where is the king
This trailer definitely confirms the return of morthra to me! Seeing the people at 2:32 to 2:38 remind me of the ones who called upon of mothra from the toho movies. The Queen is back!
What is Mogging ?
Anyone else wondering how they can make so many films about a giant gorilla
Ok I am scared because this got me hyped and I hate expectations
Ух ты😮 я ещё сегодня начал пересмотривать все части, а тут вышел трейлер ещё одной части
❤❤
Attt❤❤❤❤❤
Transformer vibes.
No more just darn release it aghhhhh!
2:30 Why is Monarch Shoot Godzilla  Sherizawa Will Not Be Pleases
Looks sick
Wow ❤awesome ♥️
I can't wait!!!!  Probably gonna go by myself to see it in theater!!!
Finally, the Donkey Kong Country movie I’ve always dreamed of.
DUA GODZILA ????
Shimo is here 2:27
This looks phenomenal ❤, i'm going to see it! Can't wait to see Queen Mothra 🦋
Didn't they called peace in godzilla vs kong. they fighting each again. Unlikely tag team coming soon. this is a perfect example of un likely tag team
Ok I think my faith in this movie has been restored. This is gonna be so much fun! The fight scenes look better then ever and I can’t wait to see this on the big screen!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Awesome 😱😱🔥😱😱
I thought for a second it was going to be giant robots vs kong vs godzilla, but turns out it's just legally distinct infinity gauntlet 🙄
Damn! Those CGI really making the PS2 proud.
Pink colour 😂😂😂 Kya bakwaas hai 😂😂
Gagodzilla vs konge where is the king 👑
Apes are in this year's cinemas, Godzilla X Kong The New Empire and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes
Hopefully, the human element doesn't ruin this movie like it's runied EVERY SINGLE other monster verse film!
Give me Minus One all day everyday over this nonsense
Looks good,fun popcorn movie
Already my favorite Kaiju film and this is only a trailer. OH LORD
Godzilla "scared" 😂
1:53 SHIMO!
Never knew Kong is the new member of Underfist. Billy and Mandy fans know what I mean lol
I'm gonna need you guys to go back and rewrite that part about Godzilla being afraid of something. There's nothing that scares Godzilla, When he looked a 3 headed dragon in the eyes and killed it.  So you telling me he scared of another mutated orangutan from EARTH and not a DRAGON God, Smh
When the toys already been leaked and you already know who the real enemy is… LMFAO!   I’m still super pumped!
I hope the sequel to this will have Ultraman
Pure Goosebumps Trailer 💪♥️
they say godzilla got bigger in size this time but i see no different.
Mais uma vez o roteiro ajudando o Kong para que ele tenha minima relevancia na obra. Bucha demais
Why does godzilla sound like MoistCritical at 2:34
They are going to cook
1:21 BRUH that's diddy Kong
Ahhhhhhh
Godzilla, why are you blue?!?!
I liked my own comment
Now why would the apes or anything want to protect humanity
Hold on a minute Playa! Tonight Godzilla and Kong will team up together in a Tag Team Match!! Holla Holla.
2:35 what are they bowing to ? Dead of kong ? 😢
Imagine Optimus Prime Casually showing up ❤️
Horrible CG. It's just getting worse and worse.
that is Shimu???
Worth the Wait 😍
YESSIR LET'S GO CAN'T WAIT Enemies Become Frenemies🫡🫡💯💯🤘🤘🤟🤟
🔥
scar king fighting Kong unbelieveble including Shimo increíble and Godzilla With his Before Power is the Blue Atomic Breath and now super siyian Rose Atomic Breath
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯🔥🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Shoulda dropped this during the Super Bowl
Anyone catch line at 2:40? Did he mean "the end of (King or Hong) Kong"?
This movie is going to be epic!
We need Kong
GOJI BROS, GET READY!
Gotta be the most hyping so far
The only concern I have is that the sense of scale is getting completely lost in the hollow earth. This 'just' looks like planet of the apes (which is still cool though).
This is badass into your realize godzilla gets beat up the whole movie. Put some respect on his name 💀
So... Another mid tier Godzilla/Kong movie?
❤
Had to stop it . Too many spoilers but this looks good !
This feels like a Godzilla meets Pacific Rim Mashup
This is the avengers age of ultron part of the monsterverse. Destoroyah is the end game
❤
From the opening, with the robotic arm, I thought that their enemy was an autobot, such as bumblebee.
0:30 DUDE LOWER SPEED YO 0.25 seconds AND YOU CAN SEE SHIMO AND GODZILLA FIGHTING
Imagine surviving all the events from the previous movies, just for a giant tooth smashing you to death
Supercalifragilisticexpialidociously epic!
❤
I think there are two godzillas in here
Dude how does it keep getting more epic every movie
If this is just another movie with boring human characters monopolizing all the screen time, in a movie being sold & suppose to be about Godzilla, Kong & the monsters that everyone came to see, please shelve it before release 🙄💯
❤
🤮
Ohh no Hollywood does it again
Still haven’t seen Godzilla Minus one yet
Yo this boutta be lit 🔥🔥🔥
2:27 you can see shimo
❤
Great day to be a fan of the monsterverse 🤩 What a thrill!!!
0:29  you can see mothra in the eyes of  jia  Mothra officially confirmed
❤
Who would've thought of Godzilla and Kong teaming up?!
Letsw go! ❤
this movie is hilarious ❤️‍🔥
Kong might be king...  but Zilla is a God!   Looks awesome
❤
When it coming out
Guess I'm the only one who thinks these are slowly getting dumber
❤
❤
Props to Kong for really standing on business no matter what
Wow!
❤
2:28 Bro call knock the teeth out his mouth that is crazy
Well it's blue again?  Ok nevermind
Best valentines gift ever!! March needs to hurry up! It’s ten days from my birthday!
That tooth fly
Wow. I have no words. Just expecting to see Shimu
Godzilla and kong thick friends.... 😂
Oh man this is fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now we know why they went the SSJ Rose route, Shimu is pale blue.
Its soooo stupid but i love it
The chills down my spine!!!!!
Yup confirmed it for me in this trailer Skar King falls and Kong becomes King Kong officially in the monsterverse and it makes sense if one King falls another takes his place
0:18 nah that shot of Godzilla opening his eyes was sick
Finally I saw shimu🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Lagendary released 1st trailer on my birthday, and now 2nd trailer on my relationship anniversary! What a proud moment to be a Godzilla fan!❤
I got hard when they was running together there..."he won't be alone"
Hayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy điênnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
No better than the first trailer
There is a scene where we can saw kong, skarking, Godzilla and shimo at 0:31 🔥💯
As a kong fan im really disappointed about the design of him
I can't get over the running Godzilla LMAO.
why does the scar king roar sound like moist critical?
Shimo can be seen @2:14 shooting his ice beam. Hardly any detail but you make out tail, massive hind legs, and upper body facing upward to blast
Shimu vs Godzilla at 0:31  Shimu is Massive
for centuries there was harmony. Then there was melody💀
THERE ARE 2 GODZILLAS
Let’s go!! 🔥🔥
Minute 2:50 Kong in fact has a metal tooth.   I think king skar breaks kongs tooth. And kong returns the favor by knocking out one of king skars tooth. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Can't wait until Kong and Godzilla join the Avengers...
Not showing much of Godzilla…
OMG YES!!!!!!! THANK YOU LEGENDARY,YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
wtf is the franchise anymore
the human plot will put me to sleep as per usual
Guys shimu is here
Goosebump Gurranted 🔥💀
nah that punch that kong threw at scar king was personal
They turned a great series into a MCU movie, SMH
Kong looks epic with that gauntlet 🔥✨️
Kong to Jia and Mini Kong: I love you 3000.
i am here for this :D
What a destructive trailer broo !
The greatest tag team match of our lifetime is upon us.
Kong about to get whooped like always in this universe
👀💥
0:31 Godzilla fighting shimo?
0:30 FRAME MOTHRA EYE BRO WTF
Kong bows to no one🔥👏
I hope this sequel is just as good as Super Bowl 58
Yuhuuuuuuuu
To much
So exciting! Brilliant! Can’t wait to see it on the big screen.
Monke gang, rise up.
Look how big Shimo is 😳
Im waiting
Bumblebee fist King Kong and Super Saiyan Rose Godzilla
I can't wait 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Kong loves the PowerGlove…it’s so bad.
Thanks for showing everything on the trailers 😊 tickets money saved
1:27   It's not just a signal Batman:It's a warning  🦇😅
IRONKONG!!!!!!!!!!
The war has begun
Watching this on IMAX
This looks… really dumb.
So is Kong cool now or….?
1:25 Is that MOTHRA’S EGG?
Holy moly,Shimo must be fking massive! cant wait for this shi to drop
Mja he aagya 😮😮😮😮😮😮
While the first trailer was not interesting for me this one hyped me totally. See you in IMAX
yea i only needed to see the thumnail to know this was gonna be heat, this is a theater day 1 for me
Shimo looks like another Godzilla
That dude has a master whip
Don't show anymore of shimu
Don’t tell me the ending of the trailer is the ending of the movie 😭
lets gooooooooooo
Its incredible how fake it looks. Looks like a video game cut scene. When you look back at war of the planet of the apes, that films apes look infinitely more real. Its very strange. Marvel seem to be having the same issues with cgi quality.
Nice trailer 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I swear i heard Charlie scream " woooow yeah baby" once or twice.
well there it is all movie in 3 minutes no need to watch 3 hours
Broooo wtf, Godzilla steal muto’s electric explosion and made it stronger, and the giant money got buffed😂 so hyped for this
Still a better love story than Twilight.... 🤣
Team godzilla
Now I’m even more excited
This looks sick!!
Too bad Millie Bobby Brown isn't in it.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍🏽👍🏽
2:33 Wonder if that scream sound comes from something Kong or Godzilla fight as a side kaiju that’s in their way
Yeah but how does this affect LeBron's legacy?
Still a better love story than Twilight.... 🤣
🔥💯💯💯🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥💯🗣️🗣️Let them cook 🗣️🗣️🔥💯💯🔥🔥🔥💯🔥🗣️🔥💯💯
It was a good trailer but I'm worried that we might not see a lot of Godzilla.
EPICCCCCCC
this is gonna be epic 🔥
Godzilla fears nobody
Kong Fighting everyone in this movie… Scar King, Shimo, The G man himself AGAIN (before working together)   THIS WILL BE FREAKING EPIC!!! I can’t wait
2:13 Shimo
Shiny is here
Abouu Special Effect is 🤸🏻‍♂️🗽
I got chills..
Uohhhh, looks amazing!!!
Thankgod minus one kya hi tatti thi
So beautiful So elegant Just looking like a woow Next level movie 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Looks fantastic, release it soon
YES YES YES
This world IS big enough for 2 kings to rule! Not THREE!!!!!!
Thanks for ruining two amazing franchises. Please give them to directors that have vision and can make a movie worth their lineage. This is just a bunch of nonsense and I’ve never missed a Godzilla movie or Kong movie.
Best thing ever happened on this valentine's day ☢️☢️☢️
I feel like they revealed a little TOO much in the trailer. I mean yeah, I wanted to see a lot, but now we mostly know the main events on what is gonna happen in the movie. Great trailer though, I can’t lie.
If you need someone to tell you what's going on, like the little girl out of nowhere and Perlman from Barbie, then you know it's got a crappy plot and an even worse director and writer. Kong should split Godzilla down the middle with that ax and then we can be done with him for good!
2:32 - Godzilla is back with his thermonuclear explosion I waited for this moment to see him like that after King of the Monster 🎉😂
Thinking of it it was a bad idea to watch the trailer now I will not be surprised when I go see it
I guess that's a better title than "Godzilla Plus One".
Gaa**d  phaad di Bhai  op bc 🤯🔥🔥❤
They just showed the entire movie in the trailer 💀
MUUUUUUCCH BETTER TRAILER! NOW I'M FULLY HYPED! LFG!!!!!!!!!
This is big dumb fun and I'm here for it
Something I noticed is that they slimmed godzilla belly down good amount.
Let’s Go……!!! Who ready ?
Damnnn so we got what Godzilla x Kong vs scarking and shimo 2v2 war 😂
This trailer give me goosebumps 🐐🔥
Team KONG assemble here .... 👇
There's a couple times in my life where I must admit Kong has been cooler than Godzilla
I'm gonna enjoy it but why does the cgi look so bad in comparison to 2014 and 2019? Like all the directors style seems to have gone out  the window
🤸🏻‍♂️🗽
Kong got the 40K powerfist now.
I LOVE THIS ❤
Everyone right now go watch the HALO drop scene from Godzilla 2014 and remember that _THAT_ was once the tonal direction of this series.
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
This is everything I imagined, playing with my Godzilla toys when I was a kid, let's go!
This is garbage compared to minus one
crazy how with probably 1/10th the budget minus one delivered the best godzilla film
Men sad , Men see big Monkey , Men see big Lizard, Men Happy for the day
Total Garbage 👎🏼
The visuals as always look great, but will they be able to tell a good story like Godzilla Minus One, we’ll see.
i know this wont compare to minus 1 but damn I get goosebumps everytime
Go go power rangers
Godzilla x kong : Mayhem
2:25 Godzilla and kong may be Titan Alfas but Shimo is the Titan Prime the one above All....🤔😨😰😱🥶🥶
Jesus the mcguffins Kong gets to keep up with Godzilla is beyond dumb. 1st a magic axe now Iron Mans glove. F just give him a full Iron man suit.
Finally shimu ko dikha diya😊😊
People are dying in the corner
13yo boys are gonna love this....grown men with any taste will say mid...
Yes yes yes let's gooooo Godzilla
From my point of view: Roar together, or bow alone...
Did they show Shimo?
Da faq is this nonsense?
yo that was straight fire
0:31 godzilla vs shimo and kong vs scar king
Here we go i see ice shimo ❤️
Shimo appears partially.
I will watch it sure but im not gonna go to the movies to see it
Finally the pulse is back after years
i’m confused so is there 2 godzillas or the pink and blue on the same cause one appears to have ice powers
Good finally something will be watchable at the theater again
Salio shimo
We have officially reached Fast & Furious levels of silliness with this franchise and you know what? I am here for it 😂
This Movie trailer is so good i cant wait to see it
Thank you for showing the whole movie.
Looks and sounds as stupid as the last one made by some Gzilla fanatic! This is just another ape, and looks like it's directly related to Scar from the Ape movies...!
They have revealed to much
No more footage. No more.
Yeah!!! NO MORE MILLIE BOBBY BROWN!!!!
This be looking like a 2v2 matchup lfg!
Waiting for Gipsy avenger to cook these fools.
0:30 Shimu vs Godzilla and Kong vs Scar king
From chthonically frightening, cyclopean giant creatures that instill pure fear, they have come to funny monsters running like squirrels. I liked the style of Gareth Edwards much more, but this cartoon is simply repulsive.
🤦🏽‍♂️..
KINO
Holy frac
The tag line "rise together or fall alone" goes so hard. this movie is gonna be so fun
This is going to be freaking amazing
After watching Godzilla Minus One I do not care for any of these crappy Hollywood versions of Godzilla.
🔥  🔥 🔥
I’ve been a Godzilla/Kaiju fan for almost 50 years. On one hand, it’s exciting to see this resurgence. In the other, I see this going the way of Marvel and it’s getting corny and out of hand.
I cant wait to see thor and ironman coming swooping down and help godzilla and kong against thanos!
_The 'Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire' trailer expertly captures the awe-inspiring clash between these iconic monsters, leaving audiences eagerly anticipating the epic battle to come._
Kong just literally broke one  teeth of scar 😂 goddam yeah!
Cold 🥶
Gojira and Kong grown up every since from there last fight from mechaGodzilla in Hong Kong
Yo this is absolute mahem 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What did i just witness😣😣😣😣😣Bliss. Beauty. Satisfaction.
That was pure cringe
1:25 is that Mothra?
It is not a profitable franchise anymore then why they keep making it  Maybe byproducts are still profitable
Am i watching godzilla x kong or planet of the apes? And why is godzilla pink?
This just keeps getting dumber, lol
2:04 RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Some CGI on a screen.
Ok they showed us a little too much.
1:53 is that OG Godzilla? 😳
Kong became thanos  Godzila goku black
2:20 round 2 Kong VS Godzilla
This is the new normal SUPERHERO MOVIE
Am so hyped for this❤❤
the budget keep on getting bigger and yet it keep on looking cheaper and dumber that's insane, the CGI looks like some pepsi adds and the cast is a perfect representation of the disaster that is the "woke hollywood" era, you could replace them by any random in the streets and it would not change anything to the story... I remember being blown away by the 2014 godzilla movie, the settings the mood, the acting and the visual effects were on point, now it just looks like some pacific rim 2 / transformers junk ...  like look at that final shot ...
Peak blockbuster
I don’t care what anyone says. These movies are just plain fun
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Seems like a superhero movie😂😂
Happy valentine's to Godzilla and kong 😂😂😂😂😂😂
At this point, the next Godzilla and Kong movie will feature Mothra’s return and Behemoth’s return as they team up with Godzilla and Kong to form the monster avengers 🤦🏼‍♂️😂
It’s peak. It’s so peak..😭
Blockbuster on the way ...
This better be good
looks like the dumbest movie ever
Super Heroes movies (Marvel/DC) are over. Now it's the time for CREATURES (Kong/Godzilla/Planet of the Apes)
Honestly this is one of the greatest trailers I've ever seen. Of any movie ever
Haaaaa so amazing!
are the movie comming to sweden växjö when its comming out?
Waiting for the Pacific Rim crossover and then we’ll talk
KONG devotees assemble here 👇
2:08 this is still so stupid looking
This is called.....movie❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ can't Wait
Kong vs shimu y skar ☠️☠️👌🏽👌🏽
Today is my birthday and this is the best gift I ever got 🔥
Nick Fury: "Now I'm here to bring together some mutha-!@#$%^& monsters to fight the battles no one monster can fight alone!"
Jbl once said you ain’t nothing but a lizard on steroids 🤣🤣 can’t wait for this
I guess they covered the entire movie in the trailer? Anything left to see?
2:27 slow it down and you can see a better look a shimo.
Love the trailer im so excited for the move.
Literally legendary
Gxk this is going to be awesome
Is this gonna continue from monarch legacy of monsters?
Its just not a trailer,its Puregoosebumps 🔥,We have seen seperately but now they are coming together so the theatres will be on fire 🔥🤩,Eagerly waiting 😍☺
Please please please dont tease anymore Shimo.....just leave it like this....this is perfect......showing him to much is just going to ruin the surprise.......i want to be blown away when i see him in theaters not in trailers.....😢😢
This trailer would murder a Victorian child
Sale godzilla minus one ahora esto, q genial estar vivo
Looks like fun, I bet the final battle is gonna be crazy.
This is gonna be good.
That's bs. Only ret@rded people watch movies like this.
A Fortnite collab NEEDS to happen This movie is collab worthy❗️
This is literally same hype as endgame for me.
This movie looks 🔥🔥🔥
So awesome
Getting a bit too Michael Bay for me. I'll watch it, but I'm not excited about it.
So good
Shimus hints are still high  Really exited for this 👏🏽
And here we..go
0:37 her head is as big as King Kong
Skar king seems kinda weak
That was sick!!! Now I'm really excited to see it when released.
That running scene looks ridiculous 😂 Movie looks super OK.  Godzilla nevertheless
CGI looks too cartoonisg
This war will be not end 😂
❤
Como pasamos de Godzilla 2014 a Kong con un guante gigante? 🗑
So who’s the enemy the other kong?
KONG TOOK OUT HIS TOOTH‼️‼️💥💥😯
And, bro, this trailer was so coool
All I can think of when watching these trailers is "Aaah, stop eating our boat, Jaws!  - GRR! I'm gonna eat your boat, and then I'm gonna eat you guys!! - *RAAARWR*  - Oh my god! What's that!  - It's BIGGER JAWS!! - Oh my god! Now we have a common enemy, we have to work together!"
I miss the time when trailers don't  release the whole movie. 😢
They should just stop putting humans in the movies. Like literally just have them beef the WHOLE movie
0:30
They know what they are doing… *BLUE GODZILLA TOYS!*
Tô Hyper no Hype!!!!! 😮😮😮😮
Even the Godzilla knows red is for more power
I’m loving the violence they’re showing that will be present. Kong getting has hand sliced by the Skar King’s whip and Kong literally punching a tooth out of his mouth is insane. These niggas bout to be throwing hands in this film.
I would rather see them fight each other again than have them fight their pathetic carbon copies
Long live the kings
Todos los fondos musicales son iguales.. de todos los géneros.. ponen bocinas de camiones 🤧
This movie is going to be epic cmon guys lets get this movie to a billion at the box office all hail the monsterverse
LOVE IT!!!
will be the best monsterverse film
Kong is a ukranian.
So Kong as the Infinity Gauntlet now?
All the trailors for this movie feels different in a very good way. Seen all the trailors, tv spot & evrytime I'm gettin goosebumps. Am so excited to go watch Godzilla & Kong kick som monkey a$$. 😮❤❤❤
Space Godzilla
Planet of the apes 4
ya quiero que empieze....YA QUIERO QUE EMPIEZE...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2024 finna have so many great movies this is one of them many more to come let’s go
“The hierarchy in the Monster verse is about to change.”
MAMA SAID KNOCK YOU OUT!!!! 2:26 yoooo im ready for this
Am in school right now I might need kong and Godzilla to break me how fire this is🔥🔥🔥
I can't say I'm excited for this considering how good Minus One was
Yeah, this looks kind of terrible
When the previous trailer first showed pink Godzilla, I had mixed feelings about the radical design change. But seeing how this trailer now shows that we will still see his classic monsterverse design in the movie, I'm now more reassured.
Beast went king David on that sling 2:47
im pretty sure that its godzilla earth fighting them
Unbelievable
Incredible! There are people genuinely excited about... this! In a world where Godzilla Minus One exists. Unbelievable!
Kong’s left jab is crazy. This 2 on 2 about to be stupid.
Is that shimo the first titan
🇧🇷🤩🇧🇷🤩🇧🇷🤩🇧🇷🤩🇧🇷🤩🇧🇷
The Valentine's reunion of the Titans
A thermo nuclear type of Godzilla???
Can we do away with the human storyline? Just give us 2 hrs of fighting monsters already 😫
2:51 Kong: *".....And then, he threw top of building at me! Me SMASHED IT! Knock out his tooth! It Funny!"* G-Man: *" Bruh... He thought a big rock could beat you?!?"* Kong: *"Me know right?!?* *Both laugh and roar at the end of tbe movie*
In 0:29 if you pause for a moment you can see mothra in jia’s eyes, SHES BAAACK
Let’s go 🙌
we dont want kong, we want godzilla!
Can’t wait
What a time to be alive!
Shimu..not shimo…
Yeh buddy 🎉🎉🎉🙌
Ok so why people attacking godzilla again ?
🔥🔥🔥
That punch never gets old 👊
I wonder how much this cost vs Godzilla Minus One.... A lot more I'll bet.
Love From India 🇮🇳💕
Valentines special
I can’t wait to see this movie in IMAX
Thank you for playing this complete movie  . 😂
Why is nobody talking about the ice version of Godzilla that sensed Shimo and then jumped into the ocean?
o rio de janeiro no filmeeee, a minha terra natal
Not enough CG 1/10
Can anyone tell me about shimo...like i am seeing almost all comments related to shimo...like who is shimo...and is he more powerful or what
cringe
I hate the Tom boy hair.
thats ridiculously epic. I laugh in awe
Telugu people 🙌
In IMAX, you say? Oh go on! This is gonna rule!
The critical drinker will love this
Lmao Kong got dat power fist from Fallout 🤣
Why is there 2 godzillas
Looks stupid and contrived.
I fell in love with GvK. Now I'm gonna marry the sequel.  Fun fact- Godzilla red is a tribute to Goku SSJ Red. As the director, Wingard is a fan of the anime.
Stop antagonizing Godzilla because Godzilla is the real hero of the Monsterverse!!! #TeamGodzilla
So kong folded scar king, and scar king called for help? Sounds about right
That was amazing to watch
Dammmmm I got goosebumps from this one
Yesssss!!! 2:26 if you play the scene in 0.50 or 0.25 you'll see the baby monkey as Kong lands the punch on scar..
I'm hyped for this movie to release, man. I just want to watch this now😢😢😢😢😢😢
This always had me questioning kong got along well enough with human in GvK so whyd they never give him a shield or anything since he almost always ended up using their vehicles as disposable weapons. yeah he may not fight like us but give him a sword and see anyone try and disarm him
Why does legendary always cast the ugliest women as a main character?
Trash
WOOOOO🎉🎉
Who saw Godzilla & Shimo throwing hands? 😂 Let's Go Monsterverse!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥wooooow..........
SHIMU CONFIRMED
The iron fist is insane. The Beast Team is WILD 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is what we want 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Still preferred the Jackson Era
Thanks no need to watch the movie now lol
At 0:30 there is a frame where you can see all 4 monsters fighting, think they got the scale of kong a bit wrong there.
Can't wait to see❤❤❤❤❤🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿!!!!!
El monsterverse fue lo mejor que le pudo pasar a Godzilla y Kong.
Just one big titan bash up. Love it. Dont really care too much for the human narrative when they could be squashed in a mili second 😂 "ohhhh years of story building wow..... oh scarr face just ate them oh well"
Good job 🗿
Monke
1:30 That's A cahlfawaeh
UwU
I have HUGE hopes for this film, I’m really looking forward to it!
Oh great more humans in my monster movie
More pink more pink pls more pink. Blehhhhh
Bro u just spoiled entire movie please please i hope there is something we didn't expect should be in Film or else we just saw whole film. First trailer was best it teases a little and we were unsure what the movie would be about but this i am just speachless, hope to see it soon in pvr or IMAX
Godzilla 🔥
This will be bad. Not bad a**, just bad.
scorcese was right
I mean it’s alright
Rio de janeiro Melequeeeeeeee
Did anyone see Skar’s tooth?! 2:27
**THE MIXTAPE IS GOING TO BE 🔥🔥🔥🔥!**
wow..
More monkeys
You think the big big bad is a Kaiju? Can't wait for the Jeagers to show up and help Kong and Godzilla.
Second trailer really changed my perspective/hopes for the movie. I’m pumped ⚡️🔥
Godzilla X Kong  Forbidden Love
Lmaaoooo this looks like it might literally be the worst movie ever made by a major studio 😅😅 What a joke  it looks like if you asked AI to make a movie mocking Godzilla and mixed it with transformers and planet of the apes and then added brain damage to the mix LOL  Go watch Godzilla minus one if you want to see a real movie
team kong & team godzilla  Let’s go ！！！！！
3 Years was the worth the wait for this tag team up monster movie!
So whos the big bad guy here?
SO HYPED FOR THIS MOVIE🔥
que basura es esta, no aprenden que nadie le interesa que los humanos roben protagonismo
If only they would cross pass with Pacific Rim
Hopefully there's no story line to get in the way of the sick fight scenes
I slept through half the movie in the previous one
As a Brazilian, it is an honor that one of the battles will take place in the state of Rio de Janeiro
"SHIMO" is coming...
Bruh💀 this is goin to flip the theatres 💯
Kong lovers vote
Godzilla x King Kong vs evil Lanky Kong.
Who is Shimo?
These human characters are so annoying
Godzilla has had enough of these damn bridges.
2:18 the time where Godzilla fans won 😎😎
"fOr CenTUriES tHeRE waS PeAcE" as if we havent heard that line in a film a million times. Kong is now some kind of protector, theres a character who dreams of what's to come, another character arechetype we've seen a million times. Theres no new story elements in this film. Its warning of big danger, character can dream about it, big fight in the city we've seen this a million times. It's the same thing hollywood keeps giving us over and over. this idea of kong with mechanical armor teaming up with Godzilla to fight some giant monster, it feels like i played the plot line of this movie with toys when i was a kid. Hollywood needs new writers depseratley.
i mean it's alright like
They have just revealed the whole movie man 🙂
The movements of massive titans is so fast here, it doesn't feel right.  It's like... are they skyscraper sized? I couldn't tell... the whole gravity of the situation just feels off.
Sheeesh, it's going to be a blast
Hard pass.
It didnt even show other creatures  like Doug, Mothra, Scylla etc.
Omg Shimo Titan was confirm😮
Ok…I am actually excited for this. The scene where they are running together in what looks like inner Earth looks pretty crappy/lame but the rest looks pretty badass. I’ll be there for this
Godzilla 2014 continua sendo o melhor para mim.  Isso já está quase virando uma versão do velozes e furiosos. Estão perdendo o controle .
а кто злодей будет опять тупо друг с другом будут драться, это уже 20 лет показывают каждый раз одно и тоже, надеюсь злодей будет
The hype for this movie is insane
They brought in Chaos from Primal Rage or what?
Now thats what I call a trailer😮 Daimnnn
Okay now this trailer is so much better than the first they should have led off with this first.
We need Megalon and Gigan to join the fight too!
NOW WE WILL SEE THE REAL POWER OF......  GODZILLA X KONG
This is too good
Pause at 2:27 when Kong punches Skar King, you can see baby kong is there too.
CHIEF: You two will be working together! As partners! GODZILLA & KONG: What?! HIM???
This gonna be epic
por que no muestran  a shimu carajo quiero verlo
Heck yeah this is going to be epicccccccc
kong got da infintity gauntlet godzilla goin s.s rose
2:52 has to be the most fire shot I've seen
They gave Kong a 40K Power Fist
DAMNNN DAT LOOOKK GUURDDD SON! Cant wait for this! #TeamGodzilla - Ma boi the big "G" he gunna lay the smackdown on everyone!
Awesome
The godzilla emp looks sick tbh.
The trailer is already better then GxK
Swadd
One billion for sure
This Godzila probably become the best from non-Cinema watcher.  Because based on trailer, they always fight at daytime, make it easier too see.  For people who watch this in Cinema probably can't understand.
GodZilla lover's vote
HYPE
King Kong is turning into the transformers. Next movie we’ll see the crossover
Wow 🔥🔥🔥
Me despeino los pelos de los huevos de lo poderoso q esta el trailer🥵🙏🏽
this with kingdom of the planet of the apes is the rise of monke
Hollywood has no original ideas, just remakes
More terrible human characters
Here before a million views
Hmmm good 😏
Let go!!!
Now thats hulk buster.
can't wait
❤️‍🔥🤘
0:31 You can see the aerial view of Godzilla fighting Shimu and Skar King fighting Kong.
Give me this movie. Now.
Looks like it's gonna be a proper kaiju romp. Let's gooooooo
The legendary monsters of the universe
Why do I see  two coloured Godzillas
Overall some parts of the CGI could’ve looked more realistic, but I got really good hopes and hypes for this film!
Trailer is 🔥 .. Can't wait to see GODZILLA in movie Gfan..
KING IS BACK 🔥
After Godzilla Minus One, I  think that should be the it and wait for a more definitive Japanese Godzilla film.  Hard pass on this one...
I really hope that we don't see the running scene in the movie. The Godzilla we all know and love doesn't run for anything or anyone.
1:57 This Scene 🥶🥶
2025: Godzilla x Kong: Transformers vs Decepticons 2026: Godzilla and Kong joins Toretto's family
that punch was amazing
this is trash
What a trailer Man Absolutely loved it🔥🔥
OMG MOTHRA !!!!
About that mechanical whip, ancient ape tech, i guess?
I’m going to watch this a million times.
Im waiting for tamil language ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well we saw the ice breath which means... ❤ shimo
2:20 Tom Hiddleston voice?
Yeaaaaahhhhh...............
This one is far batter then the first one.
This is what happens when you listen to Vin Diesel, might be rivals first but then, then you become FAMILY
Love the peak cooking in this,  can’t wait!!1!
Good preview, hella excited
I just realized that Skar-King and Shimo may be dark reflections of our title heroes whom are portrayed in a hopeful light. Kudos to Adam and the team!
ULTRAMAN MUST ARRIVE
The gauntlet details are epic 🔥
Battle in brazil
PEAK FICTION incoming!
Hey everyone did u guys see that scarking had suko in his hand and then thats when kong punched scar king so hard to knock his tooth out on 2:26
YES!!    Now lets hope the Humans don't ruin it. ~This movie will sink or swim in the editing.. ***REMEMBER, GvK editing was criminal!! The story behind Ghidorah possessing Herozarah was dumb.. Ghidorah skull had no Brain Matter & it wasn't even the main/middle head cause Godzilla vaporized that one w/ Atomic Breath.. Unless it was the head Godzilla ripped off earlier that grew back.  But even that one wasn't the middle head.... Either way the movie had a totally different plot when it was shot...
OMG OMG WOW 😱😯🤩💯💯👍👌👏👏👏
Bro Godzilla has the nuclear pulse, Shimu is sort of with Skar King and we get hollow earth battles and city battles this film is going to be epic
We got a well written show like Monarch only to have the corniest dialogue in this trailer! Effects look dope tho Godzilla Looks so sick!
at 0:30 you can see all 4 fighting in the city!
2:32 atomic pulse or is it called something else
омг что за бред.
How many more of these documentaries do we need to convince the government to revitalize the Jaeger project???
I have no idea what I'm looking at.
this movie looks so dumb and goofy and i am so excited for it
Bhaii knsa nasha krke movie bna rhe ajkal
BRAZIL… WE GOT A PROBLEM!
honestly would have been cooler if they fought destoroyah
Кинг конг зимний солдат
#GxK
Kong is my guy they better do him justice.
YES SHIMU IS HERE LETS GO!
Okay we all need some merch for Skar Kings tooth!
0:30 Godzilla fighting shimo on the right
Now I'm wondering why Godzilla looks like he's in a perma-thermonuclear state, except blue. Maybe his energy is growing too strong for his body to handle and that's what causes the evolution. Also, shimo blasting ice from the sky seems, how?
Looks better than Wicked.
கொம்மாள இது தாண்டா சினிமா 😮😮😮😮😮
2:32 it sounds like Godzilla is screaming also love that nuclear pulse
Warner Bros ain't got nothin on Toho. They can try all they want.   They took an amazing Kaiju and applied it to a basic marvel format.
Let them fight 🗿
so there is blue bad godzilla now and good pink one?
Bro I'm crying right now
The best valentine I could ever have  as a Kaiju Fan.. 😌
*Just so everyone can shut up about it... NO, SHIMU IS NOT ANOTHER GODZILLA, it's a completely new titan and supossely the origin to all of them.* 😉✌️
Pee is stored in the balls.
Holy mother of God. The first trailer concerned me...this however, I don't think I've ever been this pumped for a Monsterverse film. Absolutely outstanding 🥹❤️❤️❤️❤️
😍
Godzilla Minus Zero set a bar that may not be matched.
W
1:50 that fearful expression of kong🔥🔥
ഗംഭീരം
I miss the old kong ye
Earth can't take many more of these movies
Dontai gonna love this one
Pero qué basura.
If mothra is in this movie, i think she will be part of why godzilla turned into a evolved version, she has some kind of magical powers. A bit like in king of the monsters. My theory is that godzilla got frozen somehow and the only way to get him out is to call mothra and godzilla wakes up even more powerful
These have become Kong movies.
EXCITED A LOT FOR THIS MOVIE😍😍
Надоели уже эти мультики дурацкие, снова всех убили, попутно кучу народу уничтожили, пора эту гадость запрещать у нас в России!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 mas que bela porcaria 😂😂😂😂
good old 33 in our faces, right before 0:30 marker smh never ends
Nah that scar king vs Kong vs shimo scene goes hard asl 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I wanna see this more than Deadpool 3
this is great!
Pora thambi vediya.... 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎😎
LETS FKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
More box tickers
Where's King Ghidorah?
Kong with infinity gauntlet Kong bows to no one
Didn't think they could make one worse than GvK yet here we are 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Skar whipping along with a skeleton, jeezus man
I can’t wait!!!!! Let the chaos begin!!!!
Badassss
a bit like Kane and the Undertaker taking on the Big Show.
CLEANNNN 🔥🔥🔥🔥
ZILLA and KONG like KOBE and SHAQ both in their prime 🔥👀
Estos dos van a destruir la tierra, hay que destruirlos para siempre 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
This is everything a Godzilla and Kong fan could ask for ❤
Godzilla and Kong just feels like a marvel movie. It gives me an avengers vibe lol. What I really want for them is to started bringing OG characters
2:52
Epic!!! Love love love the Shimo and Mothra teases!!!
They pushing ko go to his highest potential
Didn’t know this was turning into planet of the apes…
Too long and too many people talking throughout. This could have used a dedicated narrator or simple text if it was shortened. Shows a little too much and gives away several set pieces and events through the movie. Ultimately, this is a redundant trailer that only did what the first one accomplished but by giving away more of the film. There needs to be a restructuring of how trailers are conceived or else these problems will continue to persist.
İron Kong?
Well blow me and call me Susan
so now theyre like roommates or sum?
Bro. This trailer goes so hard. Long live the King
This will be epic to see 2 G.O.A.T against 2 legendary new titans, and their similar forms will make the fight more fair
SO HYPE!!
Did Kong get his finger chopped offf?
Please come to 4dx thanks ❤❤
Hollywood cannot produce anything original.  No talent left in wokesphere.
Godzilla: Save mother Eartha! Kong: Why did you say that name!
godzilla using burning godzilla form
Godzilla X Kong: A titanic Jumping
Next Kong is going to start wearing clothes
I honestly love that they're embracing the crazier sci-fi elements from the Showa, Heisei and Millennium Eras of Godzilla. This looks so damn crazy and fun, can't wait!
In 30 second stop and se they all are fighting and shimu also
The fact kong is gonna fight Skar king and shimo by himself is ballsy. Mad respect this movie is gonna be peak
Omg this is going to be epic Godzilla and Kong more powerful. Who agree you hope they are buddies and kick a$$ .
The whole trailer is a spoiler.
Daaammm kong knocks scar kings tooth out  on 2:27 YES!!
0:31 who are those monsters next to Godzilla?
facinating ~
Tbh the movie's not gonna make any sense but oh boy, it gonna be an epic experience in the theatre. Everyone will be thrilled and cheer like a kid. This is gonna be an epic showdown.
Awesome !!!
THIS IS SO EPIC
Boring plot, shallow characters, no depth. 0% chance of good story telling, 100% chance of epic freakin awesome giant CGI fights on a big screen in theaters.... what are we waiting for.
The first reboot Godzilla from 2014 was really dark and everything looked dark. Now it looks like a Fortnite update... whatever, I'm still looking forward to the movie. 🍿 😄🙌
When are you releasing Godzilla Minus One on OTT 😢
if riot saw this hes gonna blow up with epicness
insane
Kong+Godzilla+Power Fist+Baby Kong=Pure Awesomeness!
Ok imax I see you
Bro if you slow it down around 0:30 to 0:31 you can see Godzilla fighting shimu 🔥🔥🔥
This trailer got me SO HYPED!! A lot more than even the first one! Can't wait for this movie to come out!
Godzilla is pink?😕
Pure Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Wack.
Godzilla and kong,,they're don't have to like each other,they just have to work together.. Just awesome dialogue🤫
absolute banger

2:28 Ebirah Claw??

They might not be good films, but my god, are they entertaining
This was crisp!
These movies always get better!

Omg what is this 🥶
Anyone else see that pulse from goji or am I wrong at 0:30
Super Excited 😊
godzilla
Man I miss those days when Kong just wanted to protect a girl on top of the empire state building, and Godzilla's just busy in Japan.
THey reveal a little much
this will be epic.   (:
2:37,is that rodan awakening in Fiji?
King kong fans stand up 🦍🦍🦍🦍👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
Kong’s got the gauntlet  Thanos: but, that’s was my thing 🥺
Wooow 🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥
"It's something even they are afraid off." It's not scar king it's shimo
This is what I was waiting for 🔥🔥🔥
Damn what a trailer…its like a end game
No Thank you.
Grogu Kong and  Infinity Gaunlet Kong
I'm sorry, but after seeing Godzilla Minus One, this movie just looks like overdone cgi garbage. I think that I will pass and wait for Minus One on streaming/home release.
0:31 You can see Shimo fighting Millennium Godzilla.  Edit: I'm so glad Adam Wingard is doing this again, it was a privilege to speak to him.
Amazing, these films get getting dumber by the year
i am glad that they did't showed shimu
One of a masterpiece ❤
Dan Stevens joins the monke and thicc lizard ! YEEE BOIII
I can already tell that this is going to be movie of the year. 2024 is a great year for movies. Shimo & Skar Vs Zilla & Kong 🥶  Edit: Mothra is in Jia’s eyes
Now if only they could remove the cringe human subplot
Good collab is good.
Just give me Biollante
The wait for this movie is no less than torture.❤
This is dope
WOW    DUNE PART 2 LOOKS AMAZING MOVIE OF THE YEAR
ainda bem que o dono daquela espinha dorsal nas mão do scar está morto
Miss millie bobby brown
Brazil: Getting completely obliterated Behemoth: Nah I’m gonna need 5 more minutes…
Waooooooooooooo!,  that is Epic!!!!!!!!!!!!
Another trash movie.
Man I hope we get 80% Kong and 20% humans.. 👏
I think Godzilla x Kong is gonna become the best giant monster movie ever.
2:39 did kong dirty
I like how that king Kong has been barried down to the ground by having him constantly crossover with Godzilla over and over again the original Godzilla vs Kong movie was good but everyone already knew king Kong would never win against Godzilla but it stilled happen and now after that instead of ending it just like how it did the sequel came out and people are so hypocritical about sequels it's not even crazy
GYAT DAYUM I CANT WAIT
Is anyone gonna talk about Godzilla in lightning mode or what?
I don't know what to say, just make them play football or something at this point...
thanx movie was great.   A little short ,3 minutes
Godzilla is always getting the spotlight movie gonna be trash.
The wont interfere with thanos or king kong. These eternals are something else.😂
wonder how many people were in that building scar king threw at Kong lmao
Pandering bullcrap
Poor Kong why does he need a human made developed gauntlet to defeat skar king while skar king is fighting with something he made on his own thats bad man they make em look weak and old tho while the G-man gets an upgarde and shows off 😂
One ☝🏻 Like 👍 For Kong Comments for Godzilla
Ok
Eagerly waiting for Movie to reach the Theatres 🤯
As a Toho fans and every Godzilla I want that in 4K in my room right now !!!!!!! PLEASE 🙏
Ready for a new Warzone event? LMAO
We all know who is that 4th titan. Hint: it can freeze anything
Awaited ❤ 💋
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So excited!
Yessss!!!!! This is gonna be lit!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Godzilla is invincible.❤
We.want.rodan
Final battle gon be sum serious
Movies steeped in CGI 🤑🤑🤑. Workers who do the CGI paid 💩 💩 💩
My face the whole time -> 😳🔥
Oh my good
Every scenes is goosebumps
I hope the next movies will be godzilla 3 with son of godzilla, godzilla 4 with biollante and hedorah, kong 2 son of kong, King Kong 3, godzilla 5, godzilla and kong vs destoroyah, mothra queen of the monsters, Rodan, a pacific rim crossover: kaijus vs titans vs jaegers, and the final movie destroy all monsters.
Next is transformers vs godzilaa
They drink giant cans of bud light at the end.
the humans in this movies cannot be more irrelevant
I have watched the entire movie in this trailer 😂
YYEEAAAAAH BABY!! I'm so hyped!
This looks so gooddddd 🎉
Ohh yeah now we got 2 big movies to debate on Kong X Godzilla and Deadpool 3 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💀💀
Awesome 😈
Already bought the tickets. The trailer to 🥵
King Louie got some pet to do ice since he couldn't get man's red fire. 😂
this looks so hype 😭😭😭
I think i wet my pants!
If Godzilla ends up doing his famous dropkick, the entire theater will absolutely erupt.
OMFG HE PUNCHED HIS TOOTH OUT 2:26
Feel like I watched 90% of this movie already.
Godzilla is evolving and Kong is literally on his own wow 😭  I also love the fact they aren’t showing too much of the movie like movie trailers normally do I’m excited
Unfortunately these special effects are just too much for me. Not really looking forward to this movie
I like the little one.
Kill me
Shimo sighting at 0:31

Those cnts are killing dreams....
Waiting time is over babee🥰🥰
Ooh yet another sequel
I'm happy 😊
Bro his tooth fell out 💀
This is Amazing ❤️❤️❤️
They need to stop 😂
F Rio de Janeiro
OMG can't wait to watch it!
Noticed some call backs to older films
If you pause at 31 seconds y on can see shimu and evolved Godzilla fighting in the top right and skate king
W I’m so exited
Ngl, this looks dope af. I wish we could've went with a more serious and grounded tone like G2014, but if we absolutely cannot have that, then I'm glad we're at least going full on balls to the walls crazy with it.
2:27 on the left U see shimus face
Godzilla's atomic pulse looked so cool
Titan vs titan  ape vs ape
Can't wait for the move like if you want to see the movie 👇
Bruh wtf is dis??)
Zilla with Super Saiyan & Kong with gauntlet!.... looks badass tho! can't wait🔥
Lmfao this film is about to be insane!!! #TeamGodzilla
2:27😮 skarking tooth
Some random reporter: "This is a buddy cop movie"
me happy
I'm so ready
Shimo is in it
Godzilla - Miyagi Do Kong - Eagle Fang Skar King & Shimo - Cobra Kai
This might be the best movie of all time
How many movies with apes do we need in 2019-2024? new Transformers, Planet of the Apes, Kong vs Godzilla three times. Considering there are about five to ten huge cinematic releases each year, about 15% of our biggest movies have monkeys as main protagonists in them. Time to make giant ape a mascot of mankind? It seems like it truly does sell. Also about 50% of the biggest blockbusters portray a giant war as the main driver of the story. It's like a big part of our history is finding an excuse for a war and then fighting for years and the movies reflect that. The plot of almost entire MCU is some folks with superpowers spend a little time finding a reason to fight and then they fight for two hours straight. Endgame was basically just that with no variation to an already working scheme. If any MCU movie has at least an attempt to tell a story it bombs at the box office. It's like a food for amygdala rather than an actual movie, you can compare it to a rollercoaster ride, the more adrenaline it pumps in your veins, the better the movie, both critics and audience agree. Is this the current state of cinema? Endless wars and giant monkeys, really?
ใจแม่โคตรมา ~ โคตรเดือด สกาคิงส์เก่งเอาเรื่อง ไม่หมูจริงๆสมฐานะ Boss ตัวอย่างแอบสปอย Shimo มาเพิ่ม นี่ก็สุดยอดอยากชมสกิลลมหายใจจุดเยือกแข็งมากก รอให้ถึง 28 มีนา ไม่ไหวแล้ว อยากดูมากกก แต่แอบเห็นตัวละครลับอีกตัวแล้ว ขนลุก ใจแม่มา
I don't need a Valentine, I have this trailer ❤
TITANUS SHIMU❄️🥶
Kong and godzilla are totally gonna F at the end.  And that's how baby monkeys are made 🫡
You have a metal arm??? This is AWESOME dude
Shimu is villain i watched his fight with kang in 0.25x I can easily see ice freeze attack.
I still keep seeing Zeke's beats titan when I see thee Skar King
My daughters due date is the same day.    Sorry kid. 🦎x🦍=😎
Also how are we excusing these background effects ? The main characters look like cut outs
Damn... This trailer is epic.
Guys put the speed at .25x and play @0.31
Paper Boi!!!!!!!!
People thinking kongs stronger then godzilla because he has lightning powers Gojis new blue form: ...
今年最期待电影 没有之一
kongs definitely losing his right hand at some point
1:53 is that shimo ?
Remember King Ghidorah was found frozen in Antarctica. It seems it was this mystery titan (Shimo I think his name is if some leaks are to be believed) since he was freezing Kong here with his breath beam.
What the hack 😮😮
Scar king should be taller
Godzilla and Kong with his own infinity gauntlet teaming up. This will be epic.
Absolute trash. They turned a somewhat ground and interesting premise into a f—king cartoon 😑
Tickets incoming
Kong badas ☠️
U can see shimu on the left blasting the clouds and sea
I'm so ready
How about don’t show every reveal or fight. Basically saw all the good parts. How dumb can you be. This dumb.
Hokage dattebayo!!!! Let’s go!!
Need trailer final
que badola meu deus
Dont think I've ever been so hyped to see a movie😬😬😬😬😬😬
I’ll probably see this in 4DX, Godzilla Minus One was amazing with that experience.
Nonesense. World of cinema has lost its sense and responsibility.
him n kong are the samme size he jus gotta longer reach ion wtf was in the lava
Two Godzilla?
Kong became winter soldier..what a smash
No!
Even these monsters are afraid of something 😏
Bro king and suko vs skar king
Roman and The Rock vs. Cody and Seth!
So is  shamu a ice Godzilla???
I was not expecting this...! This is something else 🔥🔥🔥
Who tf edited this trailer???
This is going completely off the rails. I LOVE IT!!!
Powerpacked❤
I’m not gonna lie. This actually looks really good
This is gonna be awesome!!!!  Just a little disappointed we didn't get more Titans, more Godzilla (as much as there were bada-- moments with him), and a Shimo full reveal
I'm guessing Shimo will be the one that destroys Kong's axe.
This movie will appear on Netflix and Amazon prime right?
the moment when kong smashed the piece of building with beast glove was the money shot 🤑🤑🥶
too much fantasy made feel less real and hence boring.
Not going to lie, the first Godzilla movie they made in 2014 was a real horror vibe, I felt if they kept that direction they could of still made epic horror monster movies. But they chose the path of giant battles, and action instead of horror now. I think this is gonna be a cool movie, and epic to watch them fight, I do miss the horror aspect and I feel like one of these movies Godzilla should lose or Kong, to make a new movie even better! Anyway another epic fight awaiting us!
I can’t even tell wtf is going on so it should be nuts
Wtf is this godzilla design 💀. Look how they massacred my boy.
Kong face when he saw shimo was like "Aint no way they got me squaring up with this big ahh ice breaker"💀
3 words. EPIC. AS. F**K.
I still really wanna see Destoroyah in one of these movies.
Godzilla looks so cool
Knocked his tooth through a building 😂 now this is how you make a trailer
good
This is depressing...
A
Bigger and bigger, destroy more cities, more destruction,  unfortunalty bigger is not always better ,  where did the films go that had suspense? Anticipation? Build up?  In Jaws we did not see the shark until more than an hour into the movie.  Yet it's the best monster film of all time, that and The Thing from Carpenter,  however, I did enjoy Jacksons King Kong. This is going to be another mish mash of epic proportions.
I think it's 👎
At 0:30..if u change the frame to 0.25x you can see some more shots of the 4 titans fighting together!! Looks like 2 separate 1v1s going on
0.25× zoom and i find three godzilla literally one and a evil monster just like godzilla he is a pet of red kong
Let's go 🎉
This is amazing pin my comment
00:19 is this a CGI for that Kong game?😂
2:32 Charging Godzilla like that is the most badass thing of the franchise...brilliant 👌🏽🔥
F all the haters… movie about to be lit!!!!
0:31 Our b-boy kong is doing backflip yay!  And by god shimo is massive!
Why does older movies, like 10 year old ones have better cgi than today? movie looks good though
I bet apex is the that make Kong's gauntlet
This looks diabolically bad!
one finest trailer cuts i have seen a long time can't wait
HYPE!
Which one is your favorite? Kong or Godzilla.
Ok i have many questions but i will not ask it here, i want to watch this asap in theaters.
COME TO BRAZIL!
Dear Warner Bros.... please never stop making these.  Love, fans.
Просто офигеть
A porrada vai estancar no Rio de Janeiro, filho!!!
So Godzilla & Kong are a tag-team?...🤙🏽💯
Looks like Transformers, a few things look like mistakes too🤣
Godzilla and Kong vs King Orangu Tang
Every seconds of trailer was damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let’s give the lead female actress the most unattractive hairstyle of all time
It'll be good to have that butterfly looking thing come back to help Godzilla again
Titians!!!! Assemble!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Planet of the BIG Apes
Now they're talking nonsense.
2:32 We got it! We got the pulse!
Brooo 😮😮😮😮😮 What a trailer.....   But.., who is Pink and Who is Blue one?
They shown too much smh
2:50 Kingu Kongu: Ikari no Megaton Panchi (King Kong: Furious Megaton Punch)
Damn... This looks bad.
I WANT TO SEE IT SO MUCH
LET'S GOOOO! 😃 K*rva jó trailer! Imádom á nem bírom ki látnom kell a teljes filmet!!! Ja és Shimo... hú 🥹
Why do they always show all the good bits in the trailer.
Atlas! Kiko returns!
I’m super excited for this.
I am hyped AF
Barbenheimer: The Movie
Has anybody noticed Mothra on Gia's Eye reflection during 0:30  Put on x 0.25 between 0:27-0:30
Hope we get something different besides "monkey again but now he ginger"
Looks godly
Why does Godzilla attack the kong with his atomic breath
Don't need stupid monkey Godzilla alone is enough.
You can’t stop it!! Shimo is coming!! 🥶🥶🥶🥶💪💪
Is funky kong in this one?
Yeeeeeeeeeeeess!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
That wasn’t Godzilla shooting at king with atomic breath wasn’t it?
Godzilla vs The Planet of the Apes. Featuring giant Koba.  Now get ready for the basement dwellers to start posting the 15-minute dissection vids of what they think the story is about
Welp, my nips are hard now.
Darth Godzilla is in the house!
BRO THAT TRAILER IS SOOOO GOOOD ANS SHIMO DESIGN IS GOOd
Kong and Godzilla are not fighting but working together to stop one enemy to kill the humanity
Can't wait to see the movie 😍
DANG!!!! That’s on fire!!!!!
"They don't have to like each other. They just have to work together ". Everyday scenario in my workplace  Thanks everyone for 1k like
2 Godzilla s???
Pinkzilla and too much kong´s, rip monsterverse :/ First two godzilla movies from 2014/2019 was great, but after them it goes down.
they are still hidding shimu
You know, for something that’s supposed to protect humanity, sure seems like Kong comes to the surface and kills people an awful lot……
Never thought that i would scream this much while watching a trailer( pause )
Aha. Since I've seen the complete plot of this videogame cutscene now - can we have Godzilla: Minus One back in cinemas please?
kong is taking the title of king this time around
This looks so goofy and crazy that I'm actually looking forward to it. Shin Godzilla and Godzilla Minus One gave us our serious horror of Godzilla. This movie gives us Kong and Godzilla in a Goku/Vegeta Relationship with Dragonball Z battles. I'll take it.
SPOILER- Mothra in Jia's eye at 30 second mark
2014 - Godzilla 2019 - Godzilla: King Of The Monsters 2021  Godzilla Vs Kong 2024 - Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire Monsterverse is 10 years old now rightly
Now THIS is a trailer!!!
I know that Shimu don't appear in this trailer
Scar King's weapon is a whip (probably from some warbat's spine).  Tells you how he's been ruling the remaining great apes.
They don't have to like each other, they just have to work together: Adam Savage and Jaime Hyneman.
The only cinematic universe where I'm hyped for every entry.
Another magical child has to save the world.
Notice how at 2:27 when Kong punches skar king we can see mini Kong for a split second in skar kings hands. This showes that Kong was trying to free mini Kong
0:30 , Godzilla - Shimo fighting at one side , kong and scar king on the other
Damn hurry up and release the movie. My anxiety dude
Oooo
Who is shimu am not upto date with the lore
I’m not going to lie.  I grew up watching the Kong and Godzilla black white movies 70’s, 80’s and 90’s. Been a fan all my life but I’m not looking forward to this movie. I was barely a fan of the the last Kong vs Godzilla movie.
This looks so stupid and I love it
THAT'S SUCKS SO MUCH
Who’s spewing ice?
Ahora sique son reyes ellos titanes maestro de elite saluden a Godzilla Y Kong
Who would ever thought that Godzilla and Kong after 70 to 90 years of fantastic cinema, we would see this mind-blowing masterpiece come to pass.
Okay… well this looks FREAKIN AWESOMESAUCE! heck yeah, Godzilla is freakin’ epic!!!! 🤣🥰
THE LEAKS WERE RIGHT
0:30 I can see her big eyes & mandibles through Jia's pov 👀. She's back!! 🦋
Why is now Godzilla a sidekick of King Kong ?
Godzilla fans assemble here🔥🔥🔥
I cant wait!
I'm ready
Shimo means frost in japanese..thats explain why he can do ice breathe
Kong becoming Thanos, yes indeed now I've seen everything😄
Let Them Cook😈
They understood that we just want fun and they’re giving it. I can’t wait to
Felt like I Just watched the whole movie
OK.  This trailer presents a much better introduction of the movie than the teaser.  Almost didn't make me compare it to Minus 1.
May the casualties be innumerable!
Lets go!!!
The human characters are looking as insufferable as ever
Kong somehow keeps leveling up along with zilla. 2v1 in the HE that boy 🔥
Not bad
The trailer 2 didn't show too much, but it definitely showed enough to make you a lot more hype that you already were, but even if the trailer 2 showed a lot, I really don't care because by the time I watch the movie I would already forget what's in the trailer 😂
lets gooooooooo
I’m so happy as a fan I can’t wait to see this
Godzilla X Kong ❤❤❤❤❤❤
:31 three godzila?
Epic trailer. Teeth flying. Energy blasting. Kong gangs
Another franchise ruined by woke losers. Ugly women, stupid plot stuff, and Godzilla is a confused beaoch
This looks so incredibly stupid. Can't wait.
I'll be there no matter what
I like how the toys already spoiled the big dragon
Probably not a storyheavy movie. Perfect for Chips and Beer, so i will watch it 😁
I was hoping Skar King would be twice the height of Kong, I'm disappointed but excited nonetheless.
The villain ape seems to be pathetic to be honest
We of course Kong can't stop this on his own Apes Alone Weak Apes Together Strong
oooooo i'm so excited to see this movie😬😬😬😬😑😑😁
Bro this is probably top three hyped movies of this year 🎉
Iski ma ki .....ye kya tha bhai .omg crazy 😂😂😂😂🎉
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  The Euphrates river is drying up and shaping like the Omega symbol. Jesus said he’s the Alpha and the Omega  Revelation 16:12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.
Let them Bring back kaiju universe !!!
00:29  switch to .25x and watch Godzilla is fighting with shimu
Love the Penguinz0 cameo at 2:33

The CGI & VFX looks terrible
LETS GOOOOOOO! I LOVE WATCHING THESE.
Yo everyone check out 0:30 you can see the ice guy I forgor the name but it's noticeable
(2:17-2:26) always wonder what would happen if they met again.
Hy
Sick
I hope Kong gets some justice in this movie. That giant ape deserves some wins
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😮😮😮😮😮
Kong vs Ceasar 😂
Man this had me wayyy more hype than trailer 1
OMG trailer ❤

I can't find Shimo in this trailer. Can anyone help me?
This movie looks EPIC
Incredibly Epic  🎥🔥
Конг и Годзилла дадут пизды любому Гамадрилу !😂
Ugh humans... 🙄
Ok google how can I de-hornyfied me now
A new titan with the power of ice breez  lol 😂😂😂
This movie is gonna be so freaking epic! I am so hyped!
Us Goji fans have been FEASTING lately I love it!
Hey  what is Shaq and Chuck doing wearing a Godzilla and king kong costume
Zilla and kong should have an interracial  baby ... which what these movies have turned into. Innuendos for racial cooperation
This movie gonna be fire
Can’t wait to watch this movie!!😄😄😄😃😃😃
Shimo is coming
2:50 The Final Battle Is In Rio de Janeiro
VFX - The Movie !
Legendss🔥
Barbizilla😂
Where is the Queen of the monster
😮😮😮😮
The trail looks epic
W trailer
Can't wait
Yo when I pause at 2:26. I see not just skar king and kong but suko as well in their helping kong punch skar king at split moment
эээээбаааать!!! 29 марта будет нереально жарко, весна просим покинуть чат
At 0:31 you see Kong fighting scar Kong at the center, to the outer upper right Godzilla is battling shimu
They both got an upgrade it looks amazing!!!
Hail king kong ❤️‍🔥
i love the part where they say “it’s godzarilla time”
Sick❤
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Expected:goosebumps Given: unexpected goosebumps 🔥🔥💥
W
I just came
i looked at that Kong.... uh iron fist to elbow?? i thought "how stupid is that." then i remembered its in our time 2024 and said with our engineering today its more then possible... but why not just give kong the hulk buster at this point
Wow this Planet of the apes trailer is really banger!
W
that ice godzilla shimu or somthing is commig
HAHAHAHA this is sooooooo over the top....i kinda like it
KONG: "Fine, I'll do it myself"  ✊🦍
They gave Kong the Power Glove. Its over.
Idc what ppl say these movies are amazing cannot wait for this!!
Epic I can’t wait
What I say Godzilla new lighting Kong new transformation all fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
God damn how many times they gonna fight
MUCH better then the first trailer
This trailer is on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trailer 2 is so next level that you can't even imagine a movie.
This is going to be Awesome! Too bad Pacific Rim is in a different Universe.
this looks terrible
the soy in the comments section can only be matched by deadpool fans
I don’t think I’ve ever seen Kong that scared before
Es hermoso y Increíble, como fan de godzilla y king Kong desde qué tengo memoria no Puedo esperar más para ver al dios y al rey unirse para detener a scar king y shimu.
More CGI more please 🤦🏻
this is basically my birthday gift ( 30 March ). Can't wait
Please tell me that's shimu
Disappointed this isn't just a remake of Step Brothers with Godzilla and Kong.
U can see godzila and shimo and skar king at 0.31 on  0,25 x
THIS LOOKS EXPENSIVE
If the monsterverse continues hopefully they make "DESTROY ALL MONSTERS" with more toho kaiju. It's unlikely but a nerd can dream.
Legendary is just so legendary… they should just make another DC movie man.
I really dislike where these movies are going. They need to stop
This looks so hot! Hot garbage!!!
That one shot of Shimo looked lit. This trailer exceeded my expectations by a mile. This trailer didn’t disappoint and neither will this film.
Scar king rip 😂 godzilla x kong king yes shimu owo xd
THIS. IS. GONNA. BE. WILD🔥🔥🔥
Looks amazing
Brazil reference💚💛
Shimu confirmed lets goo
Got goosebumps watching this trailer
i been waiting for this to drop like i’m an expecting dad 😭💀
This looks terrible also don’t forget Israel has murdered and seriously injured 100,000 civilians in its genocide, 15,000 children killed, aipac Israel’s lobby pays all of our politicians millions to keep quiet Biden alone has received $5 million as Israel continued a genocide and ethnic cleansing. Free Palestine.
Bro this is going to epic!
damn
Hermosisimo el tarilers
Amazing can't wait to see kong in action, godzilla just getting new saiyan forms
Kong and Zilla fighting while trying to stop a more powerful being 😂😂 they like Goku and Vegeta 😂😂😂
2:32 why is this attack of Godzilla sound like the old "WTF boom" screaming?
2:27 that left to scar king was personal
That running scene is really bad.  No matter how many times I see it, it screams ridiculous!
Yes i can't wait to go on this adventure with my favorite characters, the humans. Im all for the pointless sub plots and emotional side quest. Cant wait
Tony Stark is not dead, he is in hiding making mech gauntlets for giant apes.  Seriously though, that glove moves like the Igor armor when Tony tells it to stabilize the platform in Iron Man 3. Now all we need is Godzilla shooting a unibeam out of his chest.
ну и херня)))
two godzillas?
In Hindi I should say .ohh bhai😮
Even Kong gets a partial iron man suit upgrade. Lazy, and for a moment I thought there just wouldn't be enough illuminescent neon lighting in this one.
planet of apes..
Obra de arte meu deus tou muito haipado pra esse filme aaaa
The sad part is godzilla didn’t need to be upgraded…. He looks awful
This movie will create great sensations in movie history 🤩🤩
OMG🫣
Make this comment your most liked comment
Bahut hardich movie lagreli h Bawa tsunami aane wali h box office pe

Woooooooooooo
cgi look like trash
FINALLY!!!!!!
koi bkl hi hoga jo yeh movie dekhe
:30 Mothra
0:30 you can see all four titans
Why did i heard about 3 times cr1tikal's celebration scream
Looks like Godzilla didn’t lose his blue hue after all
Kong side of the story is lame I'm sorry. now that lil girl has some Ancient blood line and she can feel the energy too wtf lol they never explain why Kongs people need to use a super special vehicle to get to the inner earth but godzilla can shoot a blast straight to it lol.
“Perhaps I treated you too harshly” This looks good!
NAMASTE 🙏🏽 FROM BROOKLYN.
Kong 🦍
😊
Did anyone see Godzilla and Kong vs. Scar King and Shimo  0:30
Kerng gert the infernity gerntlut und Gerdziller went Surper Sayern Rerz.   Ermagersh this will be serr epircc
0:31 Godzilla bite Shimu's neak!😮
Their giving godzilla too much of a persona. He's an animal for goodness sake
1:53 SHIMOOOOO
RIP to the pyramids.
this is hard af😤😤😤
Kong Had a broken arm 😏
Nice graphics! Is this game on Xbox or Playstation?
Can't stop laughing at this secen 2:07 😭😂
1:25 didn't know moistcr1tikal was in this trailer as well
2:47 This scene are pure rawness. Titans fight where they throw buildings and things were always a magnificent view
La escena donde estan gritando me dice que sera el final cuando ya ganaron
Long live the the king and the god.
This series actually started out really great, but it's going fast and the furious level of stupid REALLY quick.
Oh my gosh I’m going to cry
is this me or mini kong was flying in 2:27
0:31 Godzilla vs Shimu y Kong vs Skar king 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i feel like i know exactly how the movie is going to play out going of the the trailer and i'm still very excited to go see it in theaters
Ya quiero que salga
SHEESHHHHHHHHHHHH
I smash ants walking, am no kong
This is gonna be damn crazy.....
I hate to say it, this doesn’t look good
Perfect, not too much detail about what happens, but reveals enough new scenes to get you hyped.
We were right about shimu
Is anybody else here Charlie from penguins zero screaming yeah baby
Тот факт, что моя любовь к Годзилле усиливается с каждым днём подтверждается с каждым вышедшим фильмом
Don’t understand why we have to get a corny campy team up movie.
Godzilla's pink and Kong has an Infinity Gauntlet, come on😢
there are no words to describe how bad this is
This will bomb so bad!
2:53 Now thats sick. Two major rivals roaring side by side.
We will get a blue electric godzilla?
Another giant comedy 😎
THIS IS SO BADASS BRO
Those cursing Godzilla for being pink will have to eat up their words.
Wowwwwwwwww auuuuuuu
Once again too many people
I LOVE GODZILLA 🐲!!!!!!!!
Iron man kong
The Quality!!! 🤐
Yeah I just saw Shimu
I love it ❤❤❤❤
Woahhh!!!
Damn Godzila has a super saiyan rosè form and king has the yellow infinity gauntlet what next they're going to do the fusion dance 😭🙏🏾
Cada vez me agrada más Shimo 😮, sigan con el misterio para que sea una sorpresa en los cines. Trailer perfecto 💯
Oh yeah.  Thats more like it
வெறித்தனம்... வெறித்தனம்...🔥🔥🔥
Kongs to swole for skar king 🦍🦾
The first movie is good but this looks amazing!
¡¡¡Long live the kings!!!
monkeys are taking over the cinemas. First this and then Planet of the Apes in May
That entrance for Shimo only showing the glow of it’s eyes is all I need from Shimo for this trailer. 🥶 That entrance was COLD.
OMG  feels like INFINITY WAR/END GAME of Monster Universe..
The next mcu
This is going to be the best installment in the monsterverse 😊 can’t wait to see Godzilla and Kong work together again!
Wtf is even going on? Super Saiyan lizard and Infinity ape to the rescue vs Angry Chimpanzee hooyaaahh 😂😂😂 What's next? Kong time travels through a black hole? Godzilla goes to dream within a dream within a-? Wtf. 😅
I’m glad that they don’t show big spoilers in the trailers. Anyway this trailer looks amazing, and I can’t wait to see this.
Chimpanzee together strong ✅  Godzilla nd Kong together beast ✅
WTF did I just watch... Hollywood please just stop already....
WB wanted to please their customers with this trailer so much, they just saved them the ticket price.
0:31  Godzilla vs shimu 😮
brooooo....this thing is loaded with goosebumps ...............!! come on 29th march !!!!
Looks like the leaks are right.  Down to scar king throwing the building with his whip.  From what the leaks said I'm skipping this one until it's clips on youtube.
2:32 Finally!! Godzilla has Nuclear Pulse! ...right?
Man that trailer shows too much
0:31 watch slowly at a speed of 0.5x you can see two godzillas there, it might be shimo also😅
Happy Valentine's❤🌈
Damn, are there so many spoilers for this? We're exaggerating.
Kumain na ba lahat?
Wow!!
This looks beyond stupid. In every conceivable way.
They should have Optimus Primal in the movie
No
2:05 me and my bro when Godzilla x Kong is on the theaters.
Godzilla & Kong❣️😘
OH GOD!!! TRAILER 2!!!!
Kong: “I am Inevitable.”  Godzilla: “And I am over Nine THOUSAAAAAAAAAAND!!!”
Godzilla is at his strongest in this movie 🎥
Long live the Kings
Ghey
I’m going to forget Godzilla vs. Kong in a way of holding a grudge match because something’s telling me, this is the main reason otherwise!
0:31 you can see Godzilla and shimu goin at it man this movie is gonna be awesome
Other then his pink form we'll be getting many different "versions" of Godzilla. Godzilla getting his Goku on.
never edged so hard before
Why it's like Fast and furious now?? These two will fight on space in climax?? 😂😂
.
Breh it’s like FNAF they keep coming back
What about shimo
by the way, if Shimo is the first kaiju, then it is more logical for him to make an ordinary fire on the contrary, because this is a classic
Why cant these two just get along ?
Epic🔥🔥🔥
wow this trailer was incredible! contemplate and kneel before the great ninth wonder of the world together with the representative of the chaos and fear of the atomic bomb in person. Kong and Godzilla, Godzilla and Kong, our 2 protectors of Humanity and the natural balance of the world fight together against an enormous force that seeks to destroy, conquer and bring chaos to the planet. This will be the beginning of a new era! One will be the King and one the God!
Was that mothra at the end?!!
0:31 Godzilla fighting Shimu
I think I really just love how bonkers this has gotten lol. Like, they started out fairly serious lol, but look at the franchise now lol. It's so bonkers now lol, it's great, and I can't wait to see how this goes. I'm gonna try to see this in theaters lol. Like, I gotta lol.
Ok I just went from "I want to see this!" to "I NEED to see this!!!!"
Man this is gonna be epic
🥱🥱🥱🥱
Greetings from 🇪🇬  Next to the pyramids
Kaijuvengers Assemble
yeaahhh let's goo 🔥🔥
DUDE, KONG ANS GODZILLA WAS STRAIGHT UP COOKING AND IT IS FCKING GAS🔥🔥🔥🔥
So we’re gonna get a 2v2. Epic!!
This is litterally Michael Bays Transformers. Why?
Loved it trailer waiting for movie 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is going to be one of the most stupid movies of all time. I think I'm going to love it.
Now King is playing with POWER
Damn.
scrambles to put every powerfist from any mini game on ebay*
damn, this trailer really makes it look good.
An ice dragon and a dicator orangutan vs A dragon lizard with ssj blue and ssj rose with an mighty ape with a blast off gauntlet . Let's see how this goes off .
WE FINALLY GET A BLUE PULSE IN LIVE ACTION RAHHH
🥲this Will win best visual effects
lets go babyyyyyy and the art style seems pretty good too!!!
They really bringing back that one dude from Godzilla vs Kong? He was one of the mired annoying aspects of that movie and that's saying something.
who my boy diddy kong body with that boulder 2:38
If we look close enough at 2.48... kong has a metal tooth at the final battle....probably skar king took kong's tooth in first battle, so the humans replaced it with metal one and then kong gets his revenge by punching out skar kings tooth.
Gonna wait for this movie like we waited for endgame. Hype at peak. One of the greatest trailer ever!!!
This is going to be the best movie ever!!!!! 😆
Looks so badass!
I was honestly scared that Shimo and Scar King werent gonna be good villians BUT I WAS PROVED VERY WRONG. WITH BLUE THERMO GODZILLA AND MOTHRA POSSIBLY COMING BACK THIS MOVIE WILL BE AMAZING,
Kong is about to have Black Panther 1 treatment. Kong fights Skar King, Kong loses and then Skar King will be the new ruler of Hollow Earth. Similar to what happened to Tchalla and Killmonger haha
2:32 wow nuclear pulse....
2:27 you can see scar king was holding mini kong by neck was trying to kill him thats why kong punches so damn hard 🔥
This new Planet of the Apes trailer is way better than the last one.
2:27, that punch was really personal 🦍💪🏻🔥👑
Godzilla looks weird
🚀🚀🚀
2:02 it's impossible for something that big to move that fast.
2.12 shimo Strom in sky....0.31  shimo vs Godzilla . 1.51  shimo eyes ..team shimo💥💥🔥🔥
0:30 2:31  GODZILLA IS USING NUCLEAR PULSE LETS GOOO!!!!!
I really hope Mothra returns to join them in this fight
SO THEY ARE FIGHT A BIGGER GODZILLA?
I've never thought a King Kong or Godzilla movie had "too much plot" till now...
Oh my god amazing, can me use this content for education ?
That blue atomic pulse looks sick
This cost over 16X what Godzilla Minus One cost and looks 1/16th as good.
I'm kinda predicting this movie might not get the best reviews but I'll love every second of it
1:09 Hey he loves it
SHIMO????????????YEYYYY
Between Godzilla x Kong and Deadpool, those will definitely be the best movies this year. I can’t wait, this movie is going to be Epic.
Im glad they don;t show to much
Horrible trailer. All the stuff they showed was already seen in the previous trailer.
King Kong is a Transformer now ya’ll!
I THINK GODZILLA ACHIEVED ALL SUPER SAIYAN FORMS 😳
The heroes are BACK 🦍🦖🤯
Godzilla overpowering 🔥🔥🔥🔥.・゜゜・  Godzilla almost kill kong😂
wtf, please no
bro so is godzilla good or bad i don't understand anymore
An electromagnetic pulse from Godzilla? Or something like it!? Bro, this movie is gon be insane, I can feel it
So Godzilla is still attacking mostly power plants because he looked pulsing with radiation and he fights with kong before they team up and shimu and skar will fight kong and zilla in Brazil in the final battle.
I BETTER NOT SEE ANY "bring ku back!" COMMENTS ON THIS
This is the most stupid thing I ever seen
മലയാളീസ് ഉണ്ടോ..... 🙂🙂
Our kong is not alone🥵🔥🔥
now Hollywood starts to copy the script from Indian movie  RRR ..😄😅
2:19 wrong guy zilla
Жду не дождусь👍👍👍
Sucks that it looks like Millie Bobby Brown wont be in the movie for godzillas side this time. Movie still looks great tho!
Let’s goooo!!!🎉🎉🎉
Шутка про barbiedzilla уже была?
Comme en vrai la terre plate et creuse , mais le film sera un navet .
That was awesome still wish we could have seen shimo tho
what is this? the 1960's?
Let them fight
this is epic but goosebumps 💀❤
can’t wait to see kong infinity gauntlet
SHIMO CONFIRMEDDDDDD
The number of bots in these comments is staggering
Check new godzila x Kong trailer. Pause at 0.30 you can see sheemu the new monster
This looks freaking crazy, bonkers, awesome, insane, amazing, insert proper word here.  Totally here for it, let’s go Godzilla and Kong!
One of the greatest trailer ever.
Godzilla and kong working together 😊 but who is the main character 😬
Kong ✌️
Kong encountering skar king and shimo in the hollow earth like "wow im really bout to get jump huh?"
This will be the greatest monsterverse movie of all time 🎉
Size inappropriate
IMAX day one...if they don't do the Legion of Doom finishing move I'll be very upset.
We need a Sacovia Accords for Kong
This Movie Looks Amazing, Kong Fighting Skar King Was Insane.
Anyone notice how Doug wasn’t in the trailer or was he
Amén ❤
shimu @ 1:52
One of the best
I just can't wait to hear him sing "Oh, oobee doo I wanna walk like you..."
You can see Godzilla and King Kong (I think) fighting Skar King and Shimo at 0:31
This making a billion dollars🤞🏻
Do people actually  watch these films???
This trailer is epic.  " It's Godzillin time "
NOW THIS THE TRAILER THEY SHOULD HAVE SHOWN FIRST, HOLY SHIT...I WATCHED THIS LIKE 20X LOL....THAT SHIMO FREEZE BLAST I BET IS THE REASON WHY KONG ARM GOT DAMAGED AND NEEDED THAT MECHANISM ON HIS ARM
Trailer 1 was ok ok...but trailer 2 is just epic...and so happy that they kept Shimo hidden..just like the 2014..reveal at the movie theatre
SO SICKKKKKK! CANT WAIT!!!
THE TRAILERS ARE EVERYTHING…now we wait…
I thought kong and Godzilla where friends now
Epic
Us godzilla fans are eating good recently with minus one releasing a short bit ago and us now having more trailers for GxK it sure is amazing
Bro stop giving the whole story and movie in trailer itself 💀
we got kong with the infinity gauntlet before gta 6
Seeing Godzilla move that quickly is weird
❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
At least they are fighting during the day.
At least 2 movies this year where Ape is the bad guy  coincidence?
I want god Zilla vs behemoth too
POV: I don’t care about plot lines. I just wanna see big CGI monsters fight.
Love it can't wait
Godzilla afraid? Never heard of it, and never will lol
It's gonna be next level on fireeee 🔥
bread & circuses on steroids!
Sheer fuking goosebumps❤❤❤❤
This movie comes out on my birthday.   Best. Gift. *Ever.*  Edit as of 3/29/24: 9/10 movie. Soundtrack was slightly better than GvK but still mid. Bring Back Bear McCreary.
I need to know if Shimu looks better than the toys before I see this .
0:31 Godzilla x shimu 😍😍😍
Thought first hand is transformer…
if they had just left the G21 model, it would have been more interesting
Godzilla: Bigger G lizard  Kong: Same old Monke, with Bumblebee hand  Scar King: Evil Monke with whip  Shimu: Ice Lizard (or Bewilderedbeast on steroids…)
Why can't I like 1000 times...this is what we need in movies. More please.
🔥
visual treat
O this gonna be lit!
Far better than 1st trailer😮!!
there is no way Godzilla is afraid of another monke
Love from #Bangladesh🇧🇩
Nice
AMAZING 😍😍😍😍😍😍
this is going to be Movie of the year and Monsterver's BEST MOVIE🔥🔥
So excited
Can definitely tell the cgi is getting more and more polished with each AD
Woohhhhoooo
K rico P
0:31 I think Godzilla is holding shimu 😂alone
Show de bola
Godzilla & Kong Deadpool and Wolverine  I think we're finally about to eat
Oh my dais. I been waiting all day for this. I can not wait.
So blue godzilla = heisei while pink godzilla = millenium?
Im glad that the only place they can fight is in really famous locations. Im perfectly safe
Kong punching out scar kings tooth to protect baby kong is epic AF
Team Kong like here❤
They really gave Kong Vi's Glove from Arcane 😂
LET'S GO GODZILLA FINALLY HAS HIS ATOMIC BOOM LIKE HESISI
This is gon be badass bro😂
How much i am going to enjoy this film its going to get heavily critiqued by the recently Godzilla minus one film going by how good that film was and by all the reviews being regarded as the best Godzilla film ever made. Personally i haven't seen it yet and so far i have liked all the new Godzilla films even way back from the Godzilla 1998 along with the new Kong films as well so i know from my own experience this is going to be a fun popcorn action film and cant wait to see it.
Team godzilla 💪💪💪
This is going to be a GREATEST MOVIE EVER IN MONSTERVERSE!!❤❤
Bruh this is batshit crazy and i freaking love it
Godzilla solo's that orangutan army. Kong is literal fodder
HO-LY-F*%!
is shimo in this movie please tell me i cant sleep tonight if somebody dont tell me
Godzilla fans attendence 👇😎
ghidorah is still the best villain
My god Godzilla Rosé Mode and Kong Iron Fist.  This will be epic
Agzım açık izledim fragmani 👌👌👌👌
I’m so excited for this movie it’s just killing me that it comes out at the end of March, but it’ll be well worth the wait
Another 120 minutes of nothing but poor cgi 😂😂😂😂
2:27
Kong now has a Transformers arm? Bro!
Ok but where's my baby girl Mothra? 😭
Outstanding 🥵🥵🥵
This is so so sooooo stupid, its amazing 😂😂
Seeing this makes me wish they hadn’t screwed up the Pacific Rim franchise. Giant monster movies can be so much fun if you let them.
Can you please film giant monsters like they ARE Giant Monsters ?
Awesome!
I hope the movie doesn’t retcon the monsterverse by making Skar King kill Kong’s parents, in the past, instead of the Skullcrawlers.
Crazy this movie has almost no cgi
Who wants shimu attandance 😂😂
This is goin to be crazy
This looks ridiculous…..ill be there opening night
I only have one question left. Where is Doug!?
They be cooking fr fr
Godzilla xKong🎉 Vs Deadpool x Logan ❤
Perfect timing...all these boring woke movies are depressing me. I wanna see some real action!
Finally he has the big boom in his normal form
0:31 Pause it and you'll see Shimo damn it❄️❄️
This is gonna be an epic showdown 😍😍.
I can't wait 🫷 see New Godzilla vs Kong 2
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:13 the simu design is fire 🔥
Yentammachiiiiii, njan ticket yedutheda makkale 😂❤❤ @Warner Brothers, please consider expanding DC's cinematic universe beyond heavy reliance on Batman. It has been years, and DC could benefit from showcasing iconic characters like Superman and exploring possibilities with others like Phantom. Regardless, this trailer looks promising and well-crafted.
after understanding the type of people who wait for this film. I prefer to stay with my minus one.
Blue thermo got me rollin on the floor cus dayum this is goanna be crazy
Did we get hints for mothra????
Just so I'm clear, the folks who made the trailer have access to drums?  Gotcha
EPIC!!! TRAILER 2!!!
They gave Kong a Power Fist?!?
This new planet of the apes movie is getting wild.
This feels so primal yet exciting
I'm here for the wee ape.
Kong got infinity gauntlet before gta 6😭
Dude that whipslash looks terrible!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Why does Godzilla always seem to change visually? Bro went from blue to pink
2:07
Monarch😮
🤩🤩🤩❤❤❤
I don't care if they make a hundred movies with these two, I'd still watch it.
TRAILER 2 EPIC!!!
This is Gonna be WILD and EPICCCCCCCCCCC
Wait so there’s two Godzilla ? Who the heck is the blue freezing everything looking Godzilla lol
Man I cannt wait
Warner bro. Where is the shimu titan.i noticed a little scene of shimu Titan but I really not🫤🫤🫤🫤🫤🫤🫤🫤🫤🫤🫤🫤
This looks absolutely epic I can’t wait to watch it 🎉
That would be great ❤️
Kong gets a power glove and Godzilla goes barbenheimer
🦍🦍🦍🦍🐾🐾
OH MY GOD!!!
when i saw the 1st trailer, i was like: meh thats ok now: shut up and take my money
"They don't have to like each other..."  *Hard cut to a passionate makeout between Godzilla and Kong*
Anyone else hear the critikal "wooo" at 2:32?
2:26 mini Kong and Kong are teaming up
Wathaaakala 🔥🔥🔥😤🤌🏻
The effects look so much better this time. This movie looks like it’s gonna be so much fun! Can’t wait to see the monster smackdown of the year.
god i hate trailer musicb
Disney/Marvel who?! WB/TOHO has arrived! GxK hits the billion dollar mark! I'm calling it now! 🤙
Just waiting for this epic❤
Wow.. Can’t wait for the theatre experience
MechaGodzilla shimo scar king are definitely my favorite villains this is gonna be awsome
I'm ready
There is ridiculous and there is stupid ... that relly like a bad patchwork of Transformerq, Emmerich and Del toro movies.  At least Minus One had some sense of cinema ... and it cost SIGNIFICLTY less that this thing
00:31 i saw shimo
Oohhh too many monkeys then apes now Kong 😂😂😂
The Camera Work Absolute Stupendous 💯.  This is one movie I gotta watch in 4k ❤
I love the way they modify Kong hand 😂
Please kill of Jia. She is just useless
I loved seeing skar king. I’m gonna get a lot of hate but I was more interested in him and hats why I was more interested in the film.
0:30 YES I SAW 2 GODZILLAS
Am hyped for this
Can’t be the only one thinking…. I’d rather watch paint dry
Nah this looks fire a f
Imma be honest, Godzilla is so much better with his new look, Plus Kong having a gauntlet aswell, Aswell as roaring at the same time in the end really is amazing :3  If yall wanna see them roar, Its right here 2:53
I love how Shimu is technically Scar King’s pet or slave
Damn Lanky Kong lost it.
@WarnerBros, can you also give us another Guillermo Del Toro produced Pacific Rim, please?
NO WAY BLUE THERMO IS REAL?!
Some things I saw in the trailer. 0:30 If you put the video in slow motion, you can clearly see Mothra 2:27 Suko in Skar King’s hand flying away 2:26  You can clearly see part of Shimo’s face in the corner 2:32  A reference to the Hensei Era, Godzilla has a nuclear pulse
Am i the only one who thinks that shadow us mothra
Me im coming
Imagine chilling at work in your high-rise building when suddenly you're sent into oblivion by Kong wearing an Optimus Prime glove 😭
Godzilla growing its hands after each movie
They brought back kongs electric powers from 1962 OMFG!!!
This is beautiful 🥰
Yaaa മോനെ ഇത് പൊളിക്കും 💥💥💥
Damn kong rocked scar king @2:27
YESS 0:53 the atomic form we needed for years full BODY 🔥
Cool
Orrre. Wow i like it
0:30 Mothra ?
*Hobbs and Shaw looks different here*
Gave me goosebumps 😮
I like it ❤😂
Godzilla king of the monsters💪
Pink ‘Zilla still looks rubbish.  Sprinting shot awful.  Better than trailer 1 though.
Do it Feb 29 please.
Honestly we need a godzilla x Kong game in this universe imagine that...
Love the Earth/Water juxtaposition at the very beginning of the trailer. Everything else I could say has already been said. Looking forward to another winner from the Monsterverse.
this looks bonkers and I'm here for it
0:31 Godzilla vs Shimu🔥🥶
Uff mwnE ajjat🥵👀🔥
Dude the inner kid in me is like screaming 😱
My God this is epic. Idc if the "truest" fans call this ridiculous and unworthy to exist after Minus One. I'm super hype for this tag team match between Thanos Monke and Pink Lizard vs Bald Monke and Ice Lizard. I wonder when will Doug show up, and what it'll do
give up
Erm… no.
0:30 We see Mothra in Jia's eyes when she has her vision !  This nugget arrives right for my birthday🤩
Do you think this means that space godzilla will be in this movie? That was a character, and since they done Mecca. Godzilla, burning Godzilla and Godzilla with a purple glow, then why not space Godzilla?
BFFs!!
Gojira is approaching the generator
This is going to be spectacular, I see you  made a lot of effort, I already liked what I saw
Kong = captain America.  Godzilla = winter soldier (then Bucky who helps kong once some stupid spell is broken).  Skar = baron zemo whatever brains not brawn/ controls Godzilla for a bit like he does that shimu whatever who's spell also gets broken at some point and he goes sleep.  The kid = the winter soldier book..she some queen and shimu is her steed guardian etc, she just can't control her physcic powerslike skar can yet  Humans = black panther aka only really has issue with winter soldier Godzilla not calm Bucky Godzilla   Yawnnn.... It's a winter soldier/civil war remix../ koba from.planet of the apes ..end of the film kong becomes leader of all them apes
Shimo: the monsterverse is mine all bow to me                                           Godzilla: you must not know i run this
Kong got his lick back on scar king knocked his tooth out
"soundwaves warbling" I can only hear moistcr1tikal screaming
WARNER BROS never disappoint us ...  👇🏻Who agree likes here ..
y’all near damn spoiled the whole damn movie but alright
Заебца
This became more absurd and exaggerated. It looks like high fantasy. It takes away all the essence of the Godzilla of 1954. It is no longer a Godzilla and Kingkong movie, it is now a generic movie of giant monsters hitting for the most illogical reason.
Скоро будет как с Форсажем. Конг и Годзилла будет меситься с планетянами))
Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire looks very epic!
Damn
OMGGGGGGG
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Rebecca Hall's had her hair done!
So ein schund
BRASIL MENTIONED
😮😮
Godzilla got blue explosion again..
This time theatre's set on 🔥
Thats "Shimu" the first alpha...stronger than King Gidorah
We need Hulk in Monsterverse it will be Epic 🔥
Super exelent video 🥰❤️
Let’s go monke x pink lizard
Hopefully Kong Gets A Better Upgrade, Like Lightning
Smack drums harder!!!!!!!
Well, aren't they enemies to each other like in the previous movie?  Are they a team?
I can't make sense of Godzilla's tail at 2:53
Agora sim um trailer top
WAIT THAT WASNT GODZILLA
Whoa!
Godzilla looks to be the most powerful we’ve yet to see.
It's gonna be a bad movie
Just give us a 20 min video of Kong vs Godzilla fight. We don't need a trash movie around that fight
2:33 why did sound like moist cr1tikal's meme
As they make more movies, it just seems to be less and less about Godzilla. He just happens to be there.
This is bonkers. I love it. In the next movie, they'll give them both rocket-powered space suits and send them to Venus or Planet X.
Can't wait for it ]
2:32 bro Godzilla blast bro king fighting scar king that punch tho knock his tooth out and shimo and the possible return of mothra bro the trailer was amazing I’m so excited 😆✨🤩
0:31 godzilla vs shimo fighting on the right side
Focus to much on the humans just give us monsters on monsters already
சிறப்பு❤
1:52 thats SHIMU❤
This is probably greedy but will they release a third trailer, don’t get me wrong this trailer is Awesome 😎 but I’m just curious if they plan to release a third one
Frozen Atom breath? Shimuu?
The entire movie in one 3min trailer 😂😂😂 Can't wait tho!!
Is it time to call the Jaegers from Pacific Rim!?!?!?
I am here for all these movies!!!
When are they going to give Kong his electric powers? They made him lose his '' ape made'' battle ex for a '' human assisted'' infinity gauntlet?🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️   Shots luk tho🙄I'm excited. however we now need a director who's a big kong fan. honestly.
Kong got the Infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved Super Saiyan Rose. This is gonna be epic.
0:31 yo it’s gonna be a 2 v 2?!
great trailer, showed too much IMO though.
Ну и дичь епта
destroyah cameom...what if
The boys are back in town
1:34  just when we thought Kong has his family now... a big red ape shows up.
My childhood self is crying right now.
Absolutely, positively cannot wait for this. This is my #1 movie of 2024, will be EPIC
I’m Literally blown away ‘WOW
ALRIGHT WHO DECIDED TO GIVE KONG A POWER FIST FROM THE FALLOUT UNIVERSE
NO WAY 😳
Bruh Skar King is getting bodied by Ghidorah, I don't see how it takes kong and Zilla to beat him, but with shimu it makes a lil sense, CANT WAIT
Damn this new planet of the apes goes hard.
🔥
POV: When you've had a thoroughly rotten day and then have to work overnight, but then you see this trailer dropped 53 min ago...
Can't wait ❤
Chat is this reall?
Yep. Can’t wait! This is my movie of the year and I will watch in 3D at the theater on my birthday! Godzilla looking like he’s even more juiced up,only for it to happen again later, and the epic face offs are gonna be SPECTACULARLY EPIC!
ITS SO PEAK RAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Be greater   Together
Oh my god just epic
1 more month! Ugh, I'm getting super anxious
kong vs skar king is a fight i cant wait to see
Kongs tribu is alive? Epic
It’s gonna be lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
More Kongs.
You can literally see mothra in Jia's eyes at 0:30  You can also see shimo a little bit
Are there 2 villains inthis movie..😅
I’m mind blown right now
So the big monkey is now Doomfist? kekw
2:26 that shot was epic 🔥
OMGGGG, THIS IS SO INCREDIBLE!!!! THANK U SO MUCH TOHO, LEGENDARY AND WARNER BROS
Чеза имба , я того сиськи об бордюр обтирал
Monsterverse > MsheU
I came
I like this trailer so I download and like it
Thought it was bayformers for a second
Kong can snap over there 🤭
letsgoooo
He Is Kongnevitable!
Kong knocked out Skar King's tooth, ha
Fantastic! This is Cinema! Gojira is back
they turned Kong into Bucky lol.
1:51 i wasnt paid for this.
Damn monkeys
So amazing, can’t wait ❤
Graphics don't look "and feel" real like what it used to be when Godzilla(2014) was released. Nowadays it looks like a movie with graphics, made to entertain kids.
Godzilla is the most badass of them all.no avenger no marvel no batman no superman no dinosaurs  no nothing can  match him
I just wanna see Space Godzilla in the MonsterVerse.
So Kong had Stormbreaker earlier, and now he has Iron Man's hand?
Sorry...
Please be good. That's all I ask
The Monarch show messed with how time works in their world. How old are these characters going to be?
Too much excitement 😮
Looks like a lot of fun
So there is another one of Godzilla 1:47
I knew Americans would ruin it with committee thinking.
🦍🦍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Godzilla AKA  Barbiezilla
Everything Changed When The Monster Nation Attacked
We got a kaiju buddy cop movie before gta 6
கொம்மால
2:50 After 62 years, Kong finally gets his lightning powers back.
This looks epic
*Fatalis SOLOS*
Shimu is coming
VAYANSE ALV!!!!!!!!! No mamen que epicooooooo, Scar King está enfermo carajoooooo 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 No puedo con eso dios mío, aaaaaaaaaaaaaah Dios que epicooo!!! 😭
What’s with the gauntlet? Kind don’t need a gauntlet.
0:31 and 2:27 and 1:57 is shimo 😱
Superb
So we're not going to talk about how Godzilla's power up sound is the moist critical meme scream? Aight, bet.
For titan who have no power yeah shimo gonna kill kong he need to be batman to win
Not sure on Skull Island Kong protected humanity that much but minor point aside I'll def end up seeing this movie lol.
Sure Movie is going to be Epic 🔥🔥🔥🔥
😮😮
I love it....looks like my kind of crazy!
stop coping transformers
At 1:26. That looks like an egg. IS THAT A FVCKING EGG!?  Edit: at 0:54. Goji kinda looks like he absorbed way too much radiation  Edit #2: The music in these trailers just hits differently.  Edit #3: It is absolutely fantastic to see the Godzilla with his nuclear pulse  Edit #4: At 0:31, Gadzilla looks like he is completely glowing, like ALL of him is glowing.
why that howl sound so much like that penguinz0 meme scream 1:13
IS THAT 2 GODZILLA AND 2 KONG IN THE SAME MOVIE
Это будет нечто!
Did anybody notice how Godzilla's voice has completely changed !
Yeeeeessss😁😁😁🤩🤩😍😍😍
What is that 1:52?
Every Shimo Appearance: 0:30 1:52 2:13 (base of the beam) 2:27 (split second next to kong)
LETS GOO!!!!
🙌🏽🙌🏽
Pause at 0:31 seconds.. Epic aerial shot of all four fighting🔥
Why reveal the second villain wtf ?
Oh yeah!
Wow thats the most powerful trailr ever GODZILLA X KONG
This is epic... cant wait
Wouldve prefered that they reveal shimu at the very last kaiju movie, being the endgame for the monster verse, since he is the origin.
This looks so SICK!!!! definitely watching this at the cinemas.
I was spoiled to Shimo when I saw Funko advertising Pop!s for this movie. Never heard of most of these monsters as I’ve never been super into the monster verse, but I’m here for it
Thank you for this. 🙌
Love from Kerala Thrissur 💀❤️
Take my money 🤑🤑🤑
The hype is real
two godzilla?? blue and Pink? ok... 0:30
Can’t wait
No like actually, what is your guy's problem adding the cross or Jesus when there's destruction?
So there is another one of Godzilla
𝗞𝗢𝗡𝗚 𝗜𝗦 𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗬 𝗔 𝗞𝗢𝗡𝗚 😅❤
please WB show to us about lee shaw on this movie!!
YEAHH LEST GO,🤩
This now looks bad to me
yall done showed the whole movie
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙆🙆🙆🫂🫂🔥🔥
From alpha predator to squeaky skinny
Nice
Another kaiju movie where cities are destroyed but nobody dies...
when kong becomes john wick
0:31  we see shimo  fighting Godzilla and skar king fighting kong  and he now has a pulse damn this movie goin to be insane
Win kong
Sold 😂😂😂😂
2:48 like dayum skar king lookin flexible and fit
Big monke and big lizard punch punch make my brain do a big happy.
Previous one was terrible, I am assuming this one will be bad as well, I will watch it anyway... 😂😂😂😂😂
Can we just get a King of the Monsters movie already. Lol.  That arcade was fun!
THE NEXT POKEMON MOVIE???
From Viet Nam with love... come on GxK
This IS TRASH.
Why'd they sample Cr1Tikal's scream at 1:15?
supar
big monke
Wakkali 🎉
Now this movie is going to be epic
I CAN'T WAIT SEE NEW MONSTERVERSE MOVIE!!!!! 💖🎞️☢️🦖❌🦍🌳🎞️💖
OH YES DADDIE
1:56 2 Godzilla's in this movie?
I'm honestly really impressed how quickly they're pumping these Monsterverse films out; CGI for large monsters became more accessible and cheaper and filmmakers immediately hopped on! I just hope the animators are able to breath and are getting proper compensation 😅 That being said I'm excited to see what else this film has up its sleeve, especially that Shimo tease!
I am literally crying in my office rn, this is so beautiful. I can't believe we just got a masterpiece that was minus one, now we get the WWE style Godzilla with pure monster rampage
This kind of absolutely unabashedly over the top, like way way over the top stuff, I like it
Kong got that infinity gauntlet.   Glad to see paper Boi making these big roles
Godzilla the best 🎉
YOOOO!! Excited AF for this!! My inner and outer child is ready
Yaaassssssss
Love goodzila
You can see Shimo, Skar, and Godzilla in the girl's vision at 0:30.
At 0:30 in 0.25x speed we can see mothra in girl's eye reflection 😊😊
Ty for this
este trailer me puso muy cachondo
Theres no difference anymore which of the american movies you watch. They are all the same , cgi orgy ,no Story,  replacable husks of characters. Sad to say i lost interest after King of monsters.
Hype level: Infinite!
I'm all about everything I just saw. Pass the popcorn 🍿
So which one is going to go Ultra Instinct first?
This will go down as the worst movie/waste of money is humanity’s history… Congrats on the accomplishment!
0:31 slow it down and pause at the city frame that is Godzilla and shimu 🔥🔥
Lets go 🎉
Are there any bots here today? No. No. No. No...   Seriously, this looks more like a kids' cartoon, or a DC movie
Woooooooooow
when will they learn that we dont care about the plot (it will be bad anyway) and cringe characters, we jsut want to see big ape and big dinosaur destroy thing
fire trailer
My God. Gonna be some movie this one 😮😮....
This is looking sooo good. Between this and minus one, it’s a great time to be a Godzilla fan
🎉 finally something new ❤
Amazing💥💥
I cant frickin wait for this movie
BC
Just 3 mins of goosebumps 💥💥💥💥
Bra I can't wait to watch this movie🔥😭
One of the best trailer ever made in history of Warner brothers 🎉
Come On We Are READY for this🎉
New planet of the apes trailer now this liking the ape theme this year 🦧
godzilla´s blue energy explosion was cool!
Damn.
Never expected a blue Thermonuclear Goji to exist
화면 멈추고 0:31보면 콩은 스카킹과 대결하고 시모는 고질라랑 대결하고있음 고질라가 보라색이네^*^
WHATEVER YOU DO DONT TYPE KONG x GODZILLA IN THE SEARCH BAR!
I was not expecting the second trailer would drop. I cannot wait to see this movie and it looks like Godzilla is gonna use his burning form again with an upgrade of his powers, this is hype!
Wow just wow
Anyone else wondering how shimu was just casually in the scar king lair? Like did scar keep him as a pet , is he that overpowered
Team zilla♥️🔥
We want Theatrical release of Godzilla Minus one.
Godzilla and Kong working as a team is all I need to see to know this movie is going to be epic.
1:56
2:12 is legendary
FINALLY
Kinda cringe tbh. They're making it more marvel-like with each iteration.
Gonna be the best movie of 2024!!!
Can't get any better than this, really excited 🤷🤷💥💥
They fixed the run speed!
My childhood! Live Kong and Godzilla!
Scar king throwing a building with his wip is the most badass thing I’ve seen😭🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen, and not in a good way. My iq dropped 5 points from just watching this trailer.
These are the best live action animes
espetáculo
Great Ape…? is Kong a Saiyan?!
WB, shut up and take my money 💵
We made it!
2:27 Kid would say mommy I saw a  tooth fly out.
Why they still attack Godzilla? 😭 Are they're trying to make war with king and his Titans or something?
Mind-blowing ,🤯🤯🤯
This looks dumb lol
Reminds me of transformer from 2007
Kong, meet jaeger.  Jaeger, meet Kong.
Let's freaking gooo!!!
Yeh movie bawaal hogi bawaal majaa aayegaa movie dekhne mein
One question after several movies why are humans still attacking Godzilla at 2:31 after it was established that he protects the world from other Kaiju?
They made Kong a Winter Soldier
That was crazy... Kong Godzilla team will be crazy... Hail to the king..
I am crying. The trailer that we all deserved. This is cinema!
Holy sh-
If Godzilla and Kong don't shake hands like Godzilla and Jet Jaguar, I walk.
Yes
shimuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Better toy commercial than the last few Michael Bay Transformers movies.
Hmmm, I used to say, “Wow, everyone in the fast and furious franchise seems to know martial arts now and how to really fight.”  Now it Looks like Godzilla and King Kong know how to fight as well.
Godzilla is pink now, Skar King uses his bone sash as a whip, Kong now uses Falcon Punch, we’re getting some more world-building for Hollow Earth, we have a literal frost beast now…   Consider me HYPED. I’m definitely showing up Day 1.
0:31 2 vs 2. And Shimu is here
I like the premise. But a lot of the CGI and animation on Godzilla looks amateur for some reason.
This looks so so fun, I’m stoked!
WE NEED MOTHRAAA
Esto va a ser épico papus
Omg🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is going to be so horrible. I’ll probably see it anyway though.
Less than an hour and boommm💥💥EPIC SHOWDOWN🔥🔥
So Godzilla will be progressively evolving into new forms throughout the film. From his original form, to his pink form, and now this blue thermal nuclear form. While Kong has a new robotic glove that amplifies his strength to deliver a devastating electrical punch.  Hopefully Kong gets his actual lightning powers from the 1962 film. Kong with a robotic glove that amps his strength is very cool, but I want to see Kong transcend into a godlike ape now.
F**k it.. I gotta watch this in theatre 😍
2:52 best scenes
🤔
Esto va a salir tan mal.
This looks so insanely stupid and I can't wait.
Bro this godzilla and kong movie is gonna be goated
Super cool
dude skarking just feels like some annoying bully with a dangerous toy....But Shimu will be brutal. Ancient power
0:20 watch this part in slow motion and thank me later
Was waiting for Kong to check out his new power fist and say "Groovy!"
Shimu was there
Kong isn't gonna get accepted in the group
Rapthlak leh mai mai
2:36 rodan?
This year we are going to see epic movies🎥 😮
Thought it would be coming at like 4 pm but sick bro
At 0:31, I can see monke vs monke and pink nuclear lizard vs icy lizard goin on 🌝.
Godzilla 🇯🇵 Kong 🇺🇸 Scar King 🇨🇳 Shimu 🇷🇺 Lol
Deym, Hoped I could afford to watch it on cinemas when finally release
this will be the best Kaiju movie ever made and will take the Monsterverse to Stellar heights
Everyone is excited 💀🔥
Can't wait to see these two titans work together to save the world🔥😃💯
Bumblebee❌ Kongbee✅
I still believe that Godzilla x King Kong x Gypsy danger will happen in the future..
It's becoming like Transformers series. And not in a good way.
If WB really is going out of business atleast we’ll get one more monsterverse movie before they shut down.
Shimo.
Please don't let me down
Oh, this is about to be a better duo than Patrick, Mahomes and Andy Reid   in the Super Bowl
Godzilla Or Kong ? Which One Is Better ?!
This is really insane
☠️☠️ this is just ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Wow amazing 👑🫀❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm already sold out! Damn this is just pure Goosebumps and a big treat for monsterverse Fans! Its already a Trailer of the year!!! <3
Chills , GD chills.😂
this is so epic. First sight of Shimu and i love how kong punch right in the face of scar king and his tooth fly awaysl
GUYS AT 31 SECONDS IN YOU CAN SEE SHIMO
Wowww
Hey thanks for making these gorgeous movies for the absolute lowest common denominator of intellect in the western world. Who’s making these frikin decisions and how much more gambling and cocaine debt do they have to pay off before someone with taste and talent are allowed the chance to do it right?  Obviously I’ll watch this movie.
Epic
People are really excited about this 😂 this movie is for 6th graders lol
One of the maybe 3 movies I'm going to try to see in the next year or so.
The final scene with Godzilla and Kong standing together also gives us a look at a serpent Titan, possibly Tiamat mentioned on the website. I can’t wait for this movie!
That scene still gets me , “he won’t be alone” and you Godzilla busting out from the ground like a big brother and kong running behind him. “It’s on now, sh** is about to go down!!”
So the ice godzilla is here ey…now this is interesting
I love how they don't understand the characters they write kong using a powerfist what a joke
So they gave Kong the Bucky upgrade
Increíble trailer ya quiero verlo.✌😎
This looks like so much fun but I really hope after this one they go back to solo Kong/Godzilla stories, the fact that there were 2 solo Godzilla ones and only 1 solo Kong one I think really does them a disservice
0:07 man I legit thought transformers joined this franchise
I think there's another big villain it didn't show in trailer
godzilla and kong will strategically play ice hockey while ice skating
Godzilla can cook something 🗿
Can't wait to see Godzilla fighting Shimo
Apart from humans every thing was awesome
Kong and godzilla are scared? I thought godzilla never gets scared of anything.
pure goosebumps
Kya bat he bhai 💯❤️👌💥💥💥
What in the goofy did I just watch
What a snoozefest
YES SIR!
Didn't they just make a godzilla/kong film already?
I have a weird affection for this series.  I’m not ashamed.
Blue pulse wasn’t enough?  “Try not to swallow your tongue”  1:14 “swallows tongue”
Shimuuuuuu😮😮😮
Trailer 2 was so much better than trailer 1. The scenes look way more finished.  Also love how we get a frame of Shimu fighting Godzilla.
2:04  chills 🥶
Holy SHI
Its all Kong & Kong in trailer & very less Godzilla. As a Godzilla fan he is the true Alpha titan, kong can't even come near him. So WB show some more of Godzilla
godzilla afraid ?!! what a load of horse S X)
Godzilla súper Sayayin rose y Kong con el guantelete del infinito
I can't wait anymore to watch this movie
"And still your WWE Universal Champion, Roman Reigns!!"
I have a theory on why Godzilla turned pink. First in the beginning of the trailer we see Godzilla glowing blue all over his body just like thermo. But what I think is that Godzilla has tooken to much radiation and needs to replenish this energy into a more powerful source. The reason why I know this is Godzilla only had this happen to him when he was at thermonuclear being one of his hottest forms. And this is the time when we see it again. But blue, with blue being Godzillas main power source showing that he has got to much blue energy and needs to transfer into a more powerful source with that being pink
Wow just wow 😮
Rise together, or fall alone
people in 2014 thought Gman looks like sloth bear, no one thought this could happen
foda
If Comicverse or Pj explained sees this comment plz like krdo yrr aap se pehle dekhliya🙏🗿
I've been watching Godzilla movies since I was a kid. Good to see him dominating after all these years especially since I figured he was more niche outside of Japan. This is going to be awesome.
So the scar king has atomic breath as well?
Way better than msheu
Literally epic...
MOVIE OF THE YEAR IS ON IT'S WAY BABYYYY!!!!!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
This movie does not look good.
damn shimo is huge when he was next to godzilla
I can't wait to see Kong using the infinity gauntlet.....
This looks stupid, right?
1. Godzilla vs Kong they fight for the title King 2. Godzilla x Kong they team together to fight a badder King
0:31 second shimu and godzilla fighting and in 2:13 we can also see shimu
What I'm worried about is King Kong's hand
18
Niceee
Kong took Thanos... Infinity ✋😂😂😂
Spread the word….KONG GIGA-PUNCHED Scar King’s tooth OUT!!!!!!!
HERE WE GO!!!!!!!
couldn't be more glad that the previous casts like Millie Brown, Kyle Chandler and other unnecessary casts are not a part of the story now...good
Godzilla run like a person.
Villian Monkey🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨🤧🤧🤧🤧
looks like kong got frost bite prob thats why he has the glove
I think.. I just saw chimpanzee ka Gabbar Singh
them running together has to be the cringiest thing ever haha
The tooth scene was epic.
2:32 theres 2 godzillas. There a pink one and baby blue. Watch it at .25x speed
if anyone ask me why I deeply trust that 2024 gonna be awesome, I'll tell them about this legend
Rip scar kings tooth 🤓💀🔪
Opening desert made me think of transformers 2
Let's go!!!
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Kong sucks bad.
Wtf why the Godzilla is running like a racer
I feel like they are 200 Godzilla movies to not give a damn about
Can’t wait for dontai reaction
The punch at 2:26 got me, just laying the orangutan out in one hit
can see  cost cutting on vfx amd cgi
Soon, we will see the new marathon between Godzilla and Kong.
Kong fans assemble 🙇🏻
I want to see this movie now
Hard
0:31 Shimu is huge. He is huge. He just towers over Godzilla. OMG
Godzilla fan can like this 👇
0:29 you can see Mothra in Jia’s eyes!
Omg 👁️👄👁️ this is so amazing 🤩🤩🤩
😮 What tha trailer men ,🔥
ANOTHER ONE 😤
This looks ridiculous. I think I like it 😌
fireeeeeeeeeeeeee
Its getting cheesier and cheesier... King of Monsters was decent, but now your ruining the G man.... just do Kong films from now on please WB... let Toho do the real G stuff, Godzilla minus one rocked!... your films make Godzilla look weak. Boooooo
Literally a marvel movie now. Yikes.
There is something oddly satisfying about Godzilla and Kong running together
🦍 & 🦖 unite, lets kick some butt. 💪🗿🫵
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
I cant express how excited I am for this! The G man ready!
2:13 BRAZIL???? NO WAY
So the toy line at walmart currently has already leaked Shimo the second titan that is working against kong and godzilla. It basically has a ice beam breath and if you freeze at 0:31 you can se godzilla fighting it.
what is legandery's problem with South America
Here before a million 🎉
Shimooooo
Ridiculous.
Even after all this evolution, we are excited for lizard vs. Monkey fight 😂
Tharamana sambavam
Omg epic bro epic
W trailer ong
godzilla earth vibes from this, getting hyped
WE MAIIN IT OUT HOLLOW EARTH WITH THIS ONE 🔥 🔥 🔥
Kong 🎉🎉
Humans let them Fight... Godzilla vs Kong, don't interfere in their Matter... otherwise u will be SMASHED ☠️
Yeah man ... first teaser was epic  and this still is epic. This wil be frickin awesome
Better than ever 👌🏻❤️❤️
genial
I just want to see how Godzilla will face them 🔥
Monsterverse has stomped the MSheU  Now Monsterverse is MARVELously be successful to peak
If you pause at 0:30 and look at the reflection in the eye, it looks a LOT like Mothra to me.  Plus the weird membrane that pulses at 1:24 looks a lot like her egg from KotM.
very impressive ^_^
Good to see Bumblebee's parts are being put to good use for once.
0:30. Did you see how huge Shimo is? Godzilla is left to him. When he stands on his back legs he is almost twice the size of Kong. Damn it. Bigger than Ghidorah I guess
I'm trying to see kong throw it back on godzilla
Just this one line "something has coming... something even their (Kong & Godzilla) are afraid of."  I really hope there´s more to it of what we know so far. An even bigger thread behind the scenes.
I’m ready 🔥🔥🔥
LFG!!! Kong has a silver tooth! And I feel like there will be 2 Godzillas in this one. In my opinion or someone please correct me with evidence. This looks beyond badass
I swear to God "the theatre experience was gone fully of goosebumps bro"🤯
Fire 🔥🔥🔥
I CANT WAIT!!!
Who tf is asking for more of these movies
cgi is dated
This trailer activated my caveman DNA
I don´t know why these movies get so much hate. I really like everyone of them. And I´m pretty sure, I will like this one, too!
I knew Kong was gonna be beating Skar King 💪🏾🔥🔥🔥
At this point the monster versis beretter than MCU bro..
Cool
Best 🔥🔥
wow its very cool
ഇത് പൊളിക്കും 🔥🔥 വെയ്റ്റിംഗ് 🤩
Yoooo
0:30 Mothra reflection in the eye.
I’m gonna get blasted for this show, imma be flabbergasted the whole time
Kong with his Power Glove. This gonna be fun
Oh, God : this is going to be even better than I thought !!
o Rio de janeiro 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This trailer is like 100 times better than the first trailer… full of action like the first movie trailer 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
BRO THIS TRAILER IS PEAK
Man, I love how we’re getting a look at Shimo, even if it’s just glowing eyes and an ice beam. So much awesomeness in this. Looks like Scar King’s really gonna be an awesome villain for Kong. I enjoy how even Kong and Godzilla show they’re bracing for what’s coming; Kong and Godzilla getting their new abilities should be cool.
Tow Big Monsters are coming 🔥
I can't wait
is this real?
Vaya chorrada.
O kuuuuuuuurw.    Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤
A bit too revealing for my liking, not that hyped anymore.
If you told me 10 years ago, when G14 came out, that not only would the MonsterVerse still be going strong, but that we'd have multiple films in it that featured Godzilla & Kong, I'd say you were crazy.  What a wild ride!  I've gotten over PinkGoji, too.  Fun trailer; I was giggling with ecstasy the whole time.  Long live the MonsterVerse!!
How tf are people even living on that planet lol
Let's hope it keeps this woke nonsense out of the movie
wow, how great it looks, these special effects, these action scenes... I have deja vu with Ant-Man Quantumania :D :D  ... There is only one king and we saw him in cinemas last fall
The fight between skar king and kong was crazy
Aha.
0:54 Why does Godzilla roaring look like Rexy in JP?😂
🥵🥵❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
This just looks so dumb.
Can't believe I was 55 minutes late
I think hulk can destroy both of them ?
Why does this look kind of stupid though? They make a new enemy threat, that threat is overpowering at first, wins and defeats the good guys, all hope seems lost, then they come back and win, maybe one of them dies, maybe not.
Godzilla vs Kong felt more like a Godzilla movie than a Kong movie. Interesting that this feels like it'll be more like a Kong movie than a Godzilla movie.
Well didn't you guys hear 2026 release GhostBs vs kongzilla
Kong will ride Godzilla in this one
This looks awesome!
What's coming is coming.
Yea naaaa this looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS A PEAK TRAILER!!! THE HYPE IS ON. 🔥🎞
this looks so wonderfully stupid.... I'm in.
Where is Doug?
titan shimu's breath was🥶🥶🥶🥶
1:26 Mothra’s cocoon?
holy fking shjt wat was that
the fact that they need to make kong a weapon glove and Godzilla doesnt only shows who is superior. Godzilla doenst need a weapon
Amazing.
Can't wait
Why does Godzilla move like a guy in a suit in that superhero shot? 😵‍💫
they should name it Monkey boy: The New Empire
This three minutes have made my entire day
how do they pump out so many movies so fast :D
Elon Musk vs Mark Zuckerberg (once his hair transplant has gone full body), its about time!
AHHHH THIS LOOKS WAY BETTER THAN GVK IDC IM WATCHING🔥🔥🔥
oh wow, A LITTLE GIRL THAT IS THE KEY TO EVERYTHING.  Real fresh and exciting stuff.
Really thought kong got the infinite gauntlet
Wonderful.
Godzilla with less screen time like always
THIS MOVIE WILL BE EPIC 😤😬!!!!!!
Monke w/ a Power Glove Monke w/ a Power Glove Monke w/ a Power Glove Monke w/ a Power Glove
I'm super hyped for this 💝❤
Really looking forward to this.  I just wish they didn't have these guys moving so fast, it kind of takes away from the scale of their size.   Nothing that large could move that fast.
I’M SO READY FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!
I wan't to see the electric powers of King Kong with the B.E.A.S.T Glove and More powerfull Pls 😢
This looks like peak kaiju stuff. Shimo's ice powers are potentially even more apocalyptic  than ghidorah's and rightfully so. Evolved Godzilla's underwater  gaze is nightmarish and kong can pack a seriously electrified punch with that beast glove !
waiting for it's release☺😘😘
Godzilla gang 👇
this seems extra stupid coming off the hells of godzilla minus one..i'm all in
Pause at the right moment at  0:31
Pink Godzilla is basically Barbenheimer in 1.
This looks like pure...💩💩💩💩
BRO GODZILLA IS TO FIRE✨️
So tell me why they are ahooting at Godzilla,i hope to ramp up his blast!!
Wow wow wow
On the plus side, looks like no unnecessary side quests to distract from the main plot.   Cons:  Still looking a bit more like Pacific Rim 2 (in terms of some of the action being over the top) than I would care for, but the story looks decent.
cgi is bad
for a brief frame at 00:31 you can see scar fighting kong and a pure pink Godzilla fighting Shimo
I have to keep watching it over and over because it just looks so good!!! There’s also so much that we haven’t seen it looks like too!!
Gojira's Cgi looks so bad Compare to 2014 or even KoTM this looks rushed
another impressive trailer from the monsterverse franchise well done toho and legendary
they gave godzilla frosted tips and kong an infinity gauntlet. SMH
Rio🇧🇷🇧🇷
Still to much people in the film. The monster fights are cool, the script writing for the people not so much
Godzilla is too high on radiation
Goosebumps everyone. not going to miss it.
2:35 Who are they ?? What other titan are they going to wake up? Seriously, will it be Mothra?
Yey
When Godzilla used thermonuclear explosion in 2019, both Godzilla and Mothra roar combined  and here we have Godzilla and Kong Roar Combined  1:25 This wall is the reason that Godzilla used his thermonuclear explosion again
Epic!! 👍🏻
Ohio skibidi rizler
Minus One > New Kingdom
At 30 seconds into the trailer during the flashing images you can actually see shimo fighting godzilla
They've made a pretty badass trailer 🔥🔥

this movie looks like it sucks
Kong the champion 🏆
Kong gets the infinity gauntlet. This takes place in the mcu now.
How is it possible that this was released 50 minutes ago and has 5 thousand comments?
I wasnt feeling this movie but this trailer redeems it for me.
I love how they aren’t showing some of the monsters •.•
1:08 I think they will meet Lee Shaw  below there
Let's Go!!!🔥😤
So... Godzilla now can be SuperSaiyan Blue, Rose, and UI?????
👍
Summer of ice!  I called it
I love that i can get so much out of one character, Thiller from Minus. Horror from Shin. And Action from Legendary.
Thx 4 showing the whole Plot and probably best Scenes in the Trailer. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Спасибо. Я только что посмотрел весь фильм и с экономил 1000 рублей на аймакс
I can't stop smiling!!!!
They really make it like some kind of marvel movie 💀
We will be there 🫡🫡🫡
Please stop with this sound design for trailers. It's been a pain since the 2020s began that every trailer is designed around the beat and cut than a succession of quick beats at the end of the trailer. Every freaking trailer does this
This is awesome!!!!!!🤩
im really confused because at 0:31 in the top right corner you can see shimo but next to shimo there is pink evelutioned pink godzilla but in the scene godzilla is in the middle and releases a shockwave,so who is the pink godzilla-like kaiju next to shimo.will godzilla have a successor???i really need you to talk about this @GojiCenter
"the great apes became the protectors of humans"  Mothra: 😢
I think this trailer was BEAUTIFUL, but if I had one complaint it would be… STOP HIDING SHIMO!
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 PURA EPICIDAD!!!!!! GRACIAS LEGENDARY PORQUE SIN DUDA SERA UNA PELÍCULA ESPECTACULAR 💪🤯🙌
look at 0:31 in 0.25 speed you can see shimo and he looks sick and you can see how small is kong next to forgot his name but the orange guy hes Huge
“Now I am feeling good because 2024 gonna be best year."❤️
looks truly bonkers and balls to the wall stupid.... I'm so excited
I like my own comment 😅.And guys you ??
I don't know what is Godzilla😅😅😅😅😅 😅
Kong collecting the infinity stones.
I’m so confused as to who the villain is. I’m thinking it’s space Godzilla but it just looks like it’s another big ape
We need to show godzilla minus one some love to
My coworker just showed me the 2 month old trailer for this an hour ago 💀 Now I’m going to show him the new trailer
Let's goooooooooooo 🦾🐒💪🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS INSANEE OMFGG
HOLD ON...MY BOIII GOT A NEW PULSE 🔥✊🏾 2:32
I miss old Kong 😢
Man what are those waaaaaaaaaaaaa sounds
Looks terrible. At least we have Minus One
Here's my money, take it
Damn!!!
These Transformers movies are getting out of hand!
Nah scar king holding suko and getting dropped by kong is gonna be gold!!! 😮‍💨🥶 2:30
They done gave the monkey the infinity gauntlet
Kong needs to stop touching little girls
This is peak.
The hype is so real on this.
0:30 Mothra is in the movie😉
Whew!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥😱😱😱😱 this is going to be good asf
WHAT A FCKING EPIC!!!! 😭😭😭
This gonna be another monster movie revolved around a little girl?
Unbelievable experience guys beacuse Two Enemies have become two friends 😘😘🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘👍
Straight 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
This movie is going to be crazy
GODZILLA VS KONG...WILL BE MASTERPIECE MOVIE 🎥  AGREES ✋
Only one god🔥🔥
So is there an evil Kong *And* an evil Zilla?? Dayum.
It’s going to be epic!!! The ultimate beast fighting duo!! 💪💪🇺🇸🇯🇵
Godzilla vs Kong the new empire i am vaithig ❤❤😘😘😘
I'm very gladly IMPRESSED by the second trailer because we were introduced to our official first look at Shimo's face and eyes! I hope that Shimo is a female because of the menacingly battle-ready glowing blue eyes and the frost breath maneuver! Excellent job, Warner Bros.! You did expertly a very great job with making the trailer look as badass and cool as it is! 😎 😮😊
Scorpion Kong
Godzilla & King Kong vs Skar King & Shimu for the Tag Team Championship. Book it NOW!!!!
Something Possesses Godzilla into an evil. King Kong removes Evil away from Godzilla.
2:32 bro turned moistcritikal real quick
Hipe for the new god of kong
2:27 DAAAAMNN KONG that's a KO
0:50 Only Godzilla Can Save This Movie 🤜 🔥
2:27 bro that punch is soo damn hard 💀💀💀 look like skar king is already dead 💀💀💀💀💀
The cgi in this trailer looks a little better
The graphics are looking little bit childish to me. The colours they have used are so kindergarten like childrens
That was crazy. When Kong sensed Shimo, he felt true fear. You could see it in his eyes. Jeez that was crazy
Most Awaited Movie This Year🔥😵
SHİMU JOİNED CHAT
Imagine if Gareth Edwards directed this. But with more monster screen time. That would be cinema.
their might be 2 godzillas
i thought this was supposed to be godzilla x kong and not godzilla x kong x planet of the apes! :OOOOOO
The way Kong fights with his  glove is insane, he's the new Thanos☠️
Mothra returning as a giant moth-shaped lawyer: 'Time to settle this lawsuit once and for all!
The weirdest things are dropping on Valentines day 😂.
Let's not expect too much from these two. As long as you're entertained by mindless monster action, that's what's important.      I mean, isn't that why the last one went well?
WHO SAW THE BLUE NUCLEAR GODZILLA?
1:25 is that mothra egg?!
Not Godzilla destroyed the pyramid
Hold on. That beam against Kong's axe, was that shimo?
Too much human stuff but it does look really cool
Time to "dont recommend channel" FR😂or else the gonna spoil us with Promos
00:46 The Shadows Behind Kong  Is Not Godzilla It's Shimo 😈
i guess they just want Shimo to be a surprise for us…
😵‍💫👻💢 subliminal messages
if you guys pause at the right moment 0:30 you will see the sizes of all the kaiju1 skar is huge!!!
The Big titan war is coming and kong and Godzilla will work together to stop it
You can kinda see a battle with shimo vs Godzilla and Skar King vs Kong in 0:31
Long’s getting a mech suit.  Kong Macross!
Pink Godzilla and Kong with a robot arm running is still just amazing
The fear in Kong’s eyes when he saw Shimo gave me CHILLS!   THIS IS GOING TO BE EPIC!  THANK YOU TOHO & LEGENDARY!!! Most importantly THANK YOU ADAM WINGARD!!!
Well this looks like it's going to be a mess.
Battle in Rio de Janeiro 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Godzilla Mowa Yuvasena.....🦖
There are two Godzilla 🔥
1:58 it's shimu the ice beam is the evidence The original Titan is here
Me trying to understand the plot of Godzilla x Kong movies: 'This is some big brain stuff right here!
Godzilla has the Nuclear Pulse from THE HEISEI ERA!!!!!! DAMN THIS FILM IS GOING TO BE GOOD (Excited for Kong's character development in this film)
Yes yes yes and more god damn yes!!!! This is gonna be epic
I was really excited for this until Godzilla Minus One came out
Those who saw shimo fighting godzilla pink🙋 00:30
w
That looks bloody awful ….ridiculous.
Its not heart chocolate but ill take it as a Valentine's Day gift.
Monarch Legacy of monster was so good. I hope the movie sets up season 02.
Goosebumps ❤
i cant believe..the movie come out next month 😍😍
Team Kong 💥
My boy Godzilla looks ready to see the Barbie movie.
Man, this is going to be a masterpiece ❤
lol they’ve turned King Kong into a Marvel character
OMFG I'm so hype to see this movie because it look so epic and badass
Didn't we do it before?
Goosebumps overloaded!
Fantastic superb mind-blowing unbelievable
Kong mowa Yuvasena.....✊
Planet of the primates  Kingdom of kong❤
Damn! Never thought I'd see Kong with an Infinity Gauntlet.
King Scar seems to be controlling Godzilla?
Double it and pass it to the next director
This looks so bad
1:25 mothra en metamorfosis?
This looks dumb. It's as if the script were developed by recording two 5 year olds playing in the backyard.
👍👍👍👍

Play at 0.25x and pause at 0:30. Is that Mothra in her eye ?
So wow best trailer godzilla x kong the
bernie 🥵🥵🥵🥵
Anyone get Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock tag team vibes here?
Kong after getting the Infinity Gauntlet: 'Diddy Kong did nothing wrong!
Epic fight was of Godzilla with MUTO
HOW OUTSTANDING 🔥🔥🔥
I wonder if Egypt is okay with them destroying the piramid, imagine if they did that to china, not many countries accept for their wonders to be destroyed.
Gojira saying hi to Kong with an atomic blast is the Kaiju version if a hi5.  Of course fighter jets are firing at the King.
Godzilla has the super saiyan 2 just the lightings, super saiyan blue, and the Super saiyan pink…🔥🧐… THIS IS CINEMATIC 🔥🐉👌🏼
:0 !!!
Thanks for the movie recap
Looks familier, is that another transformers movie?
2:13 Hi Jesus!
Skar King needs to make an appointment to see the dentist 🦷 after this tag team match
awesome no words to say
I need to see this. this will be my daughter's first Godzilla and kong movie to watch in theaters
1. The CGI is very noticeable in this trailer. 2. I want more Godzilla Minus One and less this CGI fest.
RISE.    TOGETHER ❤️‍🔥
My man kong with the infinity gauntlet
There's more godzilla's in this movie 💥💀
Another strong meh trailer
This is going to just be giant fun and I'm all for that.
Omg i cant wait
🤙🏻ESTO SERA EPICO
Testosterone levels spiked on a mad ting!
Creo mostraron mucho en el trailer
That Punch from Kong , Sweet❤️👏
Kong turning into the first autobot.
It will be blast🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm confused who the enemy is, the skinnier big ape?
The movie should have been named KONG vs KONG
anybody else feel the reduced quality of CGI? like its back to the old days of CGI kind
Amo el Monsterverse y cosas como edto solo me hace mas fanboy , 😢❤
I am down with this one
Goose bump overloaded
🔥❤️‍🔥
Nope
NOW this is the new era 🔥
Lmao Godzilla isn’t scared don’t say that bs 😂 fire trailer tho
Why do movies show half the plot in the trailers nowadays?
Anyone else think that was Bumblebee at the beginning?
AWESOME!
Noice 👌
Let's ggggggggooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Trailer 2 is better than Trailer 1 Hard pitch 🌪️
just dont make him run
WOOOOOOOOW
another flop for WB, damned, they never learn, or they are not able to
Still milking the cow
Skar king hurts kongs left arm and he has the glove on the right after
bu ne amk
Next include Optimus prime and autobots. After than add fast and furious team. Looks like hollywood have lost its creativity and keep making same kind of boring stories 😂
Im kinda confuse about pink and blue godzilla
Where's eleven?
Dude, the Primordial Shimu Mano appeared
Please just give us what we want, ginormous monsters squaring up, no one cares about the human story lines 🦍🦧
Yesss, shimu is officially confirmed
I dont know yet if this is epic or the dumbest thing i ever seen in my life.
Barrow, fetch my jacket.
For real who tf watches a movie like this? Its totally time and money waste. People = npcs
This is gonna be the greatest Godzilla Kong movie EVER
Kong fans Assemble
kakakakakka que pataquada
It's not just a symbol, it's a warning - The Batman did it better
2:26 Pause right there and you could see Shimo before Kong about to punch Skar King in the face
I just have one word....EPIC
Absolute peak
😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
The best way to describe this is... "F*CK YEAHHH"
SPACE GODZILLA
So godzilla has the nuclear pulse like hesei godzilla, multiplied by 10
太令人期待啦！😆
So it kinda seems like Godzilla is being _controlled_ by this greater threat at some point in the film (or is he just on a rampage)?  The new _Shimo_ monster is basically "what if Krystalak looked more like Anguirus?", and I love it.
Kong on steroids
2:19 I think this is a rematch between godzilla and kong
YES!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This will be disappointing for sure
2024 powerful movie this is.  Kong🎉🎉🎉
Wow!!!😮😮😮!!!  THIS IS 😍❤️  MEGA AMAZING!!! ✊🤩✊👏👏👏👏  THIS MOVIE WILL BE THE MOST EPIC OF THE MONSTEVERS I WANT TO SEE IT I NEED IT 🤩

Calling it now, best movie ever!
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THATS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:52 is gonna be that climax roar you can see some scales right next to godzilla foots
this movie will be better than endgame
2:25 even life doesn't hit me that hard
KONG REALLY MAKE SKAR KING LOSE HIS TOOTH 💀
big monkey film cool
Most Awaited Movie 🎉
Epic is what I'm feeling for this sequel. Also, the fear of Kong's face is very detailed from 1:50 - 1:51.
This is a new Stage of Level For Godzilla and Kong
I love Rio de Janeiro, now I'll watch this movie.
POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAA QUE PAREOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2:32 sounds like moistcrit1kal WOOOOOOO!🗣🔥
Excited for this movie is an understatement!!!!!
This is a movie That needs to watch in Bigscreen
They actually gonna bring us shimu.
0.31 im pretty sure in that scene. is scar king shimu and evolve godzilla idk if theres kong there
OMG BRAZIL MENTIONED 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
HERE WE GO!!!
I predict the final battle of this movie will have a death count of 50K+ people
this looks epic boring
Wow🎉
skippppp
Unbelievable yrr 😬
that ice monster who was teased in the cod godzilla update is also here
we are back
Team kong. -------- 👇🦍
Still doesn't look good. Bad writing, bad acting, no plot, all spectacle.
On Valentine's day😮 Are these two Godzillas are gonna love each other Awww man
This looks like trash
No se x que lloro pero 😢 edto me hace feliz re epico 🥵
amazing
Does Goku and Vegeta look a bit different ?
Wow wow wow wow first day first show
Brazil presence
Never seen a monsterverse movie.But after this trailer i will try to see everything before this movie comes out
2:14 Shimo shooting her ice breath at the sky
Modern Showa Era of Godzilla looking good
With every trailer they get us hyped. This is epic 🤯🤯
This looks like a true blockbuster movie. Thank you for not taking the fun out of movies. In an age where movies try to be more serious than they actually are.
After long time we goona see Gauntlet action again🙊🙊🦍
Perfec
also realised the scene with kongs face zoomed in i can see his right eye is shut as if its injured and he could be blind
Lightning thermo nuclear godzilla 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Wow!
OMFGGGGGGG❤❤❤❤❤🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟 YES FKERSSSSSS THATS WHATS UP
SHIMOOOOOOOOOO
This is going to be rubbish
2:32 sounds like moistcrit1kal WOOOOOOO!🗣🔥
This looks sick
Kong is the king of punches 💪👊
Now I have seen everything
Kasam se bawaal hai ye trailer bawaal
Lol looks like a fail. Too much bs not enough acting
This grapichs with dlss hahahahahahaahah
This was a far better trailer! The 1st one didnt really hook me, but this has me there opening night! Goosebumps
Shiiii shimu is theree
Its weird to see Godzilla running
DAMN!!!!!!
Dude, Godzilla with the nuclear pulse at 2:33 !!  Looks amazing.
who is stronger: ice turtle, nuclear lizard or big monke
Just can’t wait to see this 🎉🎉
2:27 😳🔥🔥🔥
Why did they give kong infinity gauntlet?
What a shame. Making this dogshit after Godzilla minus one
My inner child peed a little. 😶
Now can we get pacific rim bots
Let me guess Kong is a tranny in this one and godzilla is non binary bipolar disorder
NaturexGodzilla + KongxHuman
INDIAN fans attend 💖
This'll be on fire like Ghost Rider!
0:31 Godzilla vs Shimo & kong vs Scar King
God damn nice
Not impressed..all them monsters moving like John wick, Hella quick, doesn't give the impression of immense size and strength...this is clearly a long film featuring Godzilla who's fookin pink 😒the skar king ape doesn't even look big and formidable without that whip..🫤
Monsterverse has replaced the MCU in popularity and anticipation. Cannot wait! One more month!
I MUST SEE THIS MOVIE
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
wow
Finally Shimo is confirmed by the directors This movie is gonna be epic😀😀
Idk looks pretty bad
🔥🔥🔥🔥 especially after Monarch!
👏👏👏👏😱 é isso q agente quer ☝
definitely this will take oscar in  2024❤🎉.
Is it another godzilla?
Wow super
En el segundo 0:31 se ve a shimo cuerpo completo por unos milisegundos
Finally a movie putting that big budget to use.
Yeah, podcast guy.
Damn! দাঁত ফেলে দিলো।🤣🤣
in 2:27 theres shimo face in right corner back of scar king do slow speed 0.25x
Wow, it will be amazing!
That one sight of shimu's beam got my heart there (1:53) , surely it's for IMAX
Is theres new blue thermo godzilla💀
That trailer 2 so good and awesome
Minus❤
Where is shimu???
Adagommala🥵💥🔥
Damn..Epic....!!!!
Who else have taught  that they merged transformer franchise in this?
0:30 Shimu vs godzilla on the top right!
Biggest movie of 2024!!!!!!!
Godzilla is suchh a cutie patootie
This confirms that godzilla is a saiyan😂
Good movie ❤
That's even better than the first
I think the Blue Thermonuclear Goji is from the past. I mean it's part of the flashback. 😊
So is there like a evil Godzilla in this movie bc what was that Kong was looking at through the lava
This trailer for Napoleon 2 or what
2:30 Godzilla: WOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAHHHHH BABY!!!!!
This looks horrible 🐒💩
0:30 is that two godzilla's on the right??
I'm a world where story doesn't matter because Godzilla has pink fire
Godzilla vs Kong the new vaiting 🤩
Big G got the EMP 🔥🔥🔥
Godzilla vs Scar face first battle will be epic
Yeah I’m erect
2:08 meme potential
The different versions of Godzilla is going to be awesome.
Shimo and Scar king VS Kong and Godzilla
Esto ha a ser epico
This planet isn't big enough for the three of them.
This is going to be my favorite buddy cop movie.
I'm sorry, this looks dreadful. Give this franchise back to Toho. They know what to do with it.
Bro this is just amazing, Shimo, Skar king vs Kong, Godzilla blue and pink, so cool........0:30 Shimu second.....OMG
Shimo conformed
2:26 I'm more of a Godzilla fan but DAMN
Someone at Warner must have woken up saying "SH* the super bowl was 3 days ago"
Kong needs a manicure.
The monkey chain, the monkey’s fist, THE MONKEY
Now that's a trailer 🔥
can they dance? or talk or go to part? they should be animals not some fancy human like heroes. What is wrong with  this shi... ?
OMG GOOSEBUMPS 🦆
Don't ever play Godzilla that beast ain't scared of anything
This might become Warner Bros' Jesus 😍
WOOHOOO LETS GOO! Cant wait to watch it on cinema
Basically just saw the whole movie. So I'm good
So their not showing us Shimu
En efecto es cine
"Apes, together, strong," thought the Kongs before they collectively get nuked by Godzilla.
Fast & The Furious 11: Godzilla x Kong (Directed by Michael Bay)
Might be speaking too soon, but I think Skar King could be one of the greatest villains in Godzilla/Kong history.  He’s not just a tool under the control of aliens or an animal following primal instincts. Skar King is intelligent enough to understand power, subjugation and cruelty, the same way Kong understands mercy and compassion. Truly the Ying to Kong’s Yang.
Excited 🔥
When Will March 29th Come 😢 Can't Wait Anymore!
So it's "The Six Million Dollar Kong"?  Is that it?  And they have to fight Ghidorah, right?
nah they made thanos gauntlet for my monke
F modern movies
wow, it's awesome
... Hype.
How will this effect the kaiju universe meta
Icredible🤩🤩🤩
Finally they show something in this trailer unlike the first 1..an eye behind scar king..knew it shimu will be partner with scar..aint know way big G and kong need  to team up just to fight a single giant ape..
This just doesn't feel like Godzilla at all. I have to view it as something completely different, cause they really don't understand the monster or its mythos and why they are so beloved. This is so Marvelfied that they've lost all identity
Please take my money. We’re there!
My wish list to see  1 mothra 2 Doug 3 sckylla vs Godzilla
I feel there's another villian than just a skinny monkey
So what im hearing is a 2v2
Rio de Janeiro brazil🇧🇷
Leets goooooo this is the year of monkeys 🙊 👊🏻
It's almost as if the gods themselves have chosen to grace me with the best birthday gift ever! I'M GOING TO WATCH THIS AND LOVE THIS JUST LIKE I DID MINUS ONE!
Skar King V. Kong fights going to be 🔥⚡️😮💯🦧🦍 . Shimo eyes and the frost bite blast looks Incredible 💯. Godzilla exploding with his blue atomic Energy gonna be Epic 💯😮. Best Movie of 2024💯💯✨️😎✊🏾.
Oh wow, Godzilla mastered his EMP ability! Nice 🤘
This is beautiful! I also love how Kong and Goji still dont really like eachother, but hopefully they work it out.
I’ll wait till it’s on free
Dark
Shimo is here.
This looks like so much fun!
"The World needs Godzilla and Kong the world need them both" DUDE THIS WAS BETTER THEN THE FIRST TRAILER I LOSING MY MIND I THINK THIS WILL BE MOVIE OF 2024!!!!! LETS FREAKING GOOOOOO!!!!!! 😆❤🦖🦍
Superb😊😊
This movie will be best of 2024 side by deadpool..
The new batman and superman
Why I am repeating why I am getting goosebumps
I’m sorry but man oh man this looks so CORNYYYY what did they do to my boys😫😫💀😭😭😭up here lookin like avengers lookin ahh .. kong got a dang infinity gauntlet an Godzilla runnin like Ezra I can’t😩dang.. this gunna be a mess
What is the fantastical trailer I have ever seen
0:55 Don't you speak for Godzilla, monkey woman. Had enough of you in the first movie.
🤨🤨😀😀😀😀😀😀😍😍
If you pause it at 0:31 you can see godzilla fight shimo who is way damn larger then him :o
Shrek called, he wants his milk back
we finally have a closer look to shimo
Always excited for an action packed kaiju smack down!
The audacity to say that Godzilla is scared of something is blasphemes...
2:31-2:34 *I. AM. ATOMIC* 😂😂
This movie is gonna be stupid fun and I love it!🐊🦍
Return to Monke
Kong and Godzilla teamed up to beat up an old man, justice for the red bro!
Broooo This trailer is Legendary  !!!
Next level
So Kong is the 'good cop'?...
Kong out here with the infinity gauntlet 😂
Nuclear pulse 🔥🔥🔥
We hyped 🔥
2:27 "Damn"
1:14 entering to MCU timeline then ask for Ironman to build gauntlet for Kong 2:43
This is so good
why theres always a deaf girl LOL
I'm sorry, after seeing the Godzilla Minus One movie, this looks like cheesy Transformers or Pacific Rim2 level pink Power Rangers goof.  It's a PASS.
Ladies and gentlemen. It's epic. I would even say... legendary
Man I'm ready for Kong to be king! I know for certain that this will be the movie that gives him the title king kong!
I just don't care for the human dialogue with their crappy one liners.
I WANNA SEEE THE MOVIE RIGHT NOWWWWWWWWWW
This franchise needs to end before it becomes Fast and Furious
Looks dumb as f'
❤❤❤
Is that titanius shimu with blue eyes😢
I want to like this. But last movie they went up against just another Godzilla, and this time they're going up against just another Kong. There are so many other great kaiju out there. There's even a ton of freedom to create brand new ones and you're just giving us evil clones of the heroes.
This movie is going to be fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bros getting the infinity stones
와씨 개재밌겟다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Don't think I've been as hyped about a movie like this in forever.
monke + icey boi vs monke + iguana
Cant wait for the pubg mobile collaboration😂
Did kong just knock out skar king tooth out 😳
They should rename this    “The other guys”😂😂😂😂
God
Grogu in every movie
The sound design in this trailer🔥
Looks cartoonish , expected better CGI 😢
Boo! They should've give Godzilla go-go gadget roller skates for his tail so he could do a sliding drop kick.  🛼🛼🦎
I think I may have just nutted
why this trailer be so loud bro
aight cant wait for godzilla x kong x transformers
Kong Fans Assemble 🔥🔥
Mass Appeal :)
2:53  Kong : Check out my Infinity Gauntlet!! Godzilla : Check out my Super Saiyan Rose Mode!!
WB: How many Godzilla movies u want? Me: Yes
Epic!!!
😐
Będzie grubo
Wow 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
GOOOOOODDD 🔥🔥🔥
They look like real dudes running
KING KONG 🦍👑
I feel like this has become a Monster MCU. I want monster fights and cowering governments trying to survive monster fights, so how did they beat mechazilla (who was a TERRIBLE villain if we are being honest, compared to King G), they needed teenagers to spill booze on a computer that controlled mechazilla...
At 0:30 pause this we can see kong fighting skar king and godzilla fighting shimo.. what's crazy about this is that shimo is the same size or even bigger than godzilla 😮
This gon b 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:30 it's Mothra❤❤
I just laugh at the state of hollywood
CGI look super good.this will definitely be the best movie of the year.
Godzilla afraid?!?!
Esari evil kong jathini mingapothunam 😅😂❤
I peed myself
😊😊😊
The scale in this movie is all over the place
Why would Godzilla be afraid of another giant, mediocre ape who shoots ice beams? It seems like this universe is gravitating toward Kong, but they should shift the focus back to Godzilla and introduce a real badass monster who can actually threaten Godzilla. So sick of seeing stupid apes.
0:53 1:16 2:19
😮😮😮😮oh ho Jabar dast 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Na there’s no way Godzilla is afraid of this scar king, so whatever that monster is at 1:54 must be huge.
Is it me or does it feel like there’s a new Godzilla movie every 3 months 😂 Excited for this one
Gozilla Minus One, makes this look like a Cartoon.
Godzilla 2014 is still the BEST version ever…
Who's going to go see this movie wit me?  I'll bring the popcorn!  👇
Godzilla is afraid guys.  The Big G is afraid!  Thats a problem
I just pray this isn’t another movie where they use godzillas name to tell kings story
Next they go to space. It's all about family 😊
Godzilla ❤ Kong
Where is shumo
LETS GOOOO!!!!!
co to za gówno 😭😭😭
This looks epic, can’t wait for the movie to be out
Nuclear blue godzilla is fighting scar king and the evolved pink godzilla is fighting shimo in 0:31
After long time going to theater to watch masterpiece
എന്തരോ എന്തോ 😁
Brasil Sil Sil 🇧🇷🇧🇷
This is going to be the best one yet!!!
Kong got the infinity gauntlet
Simplemente va a ser cine ❤🧐👌🏻
1:52 Shimo
0,25x and pause 00:31
Bawala hai
whos at 1:54?
Oh man it’s exiting seen the trailer, the fights, and what’s coming our way, I have seen Godzilla 2014, Kong skull island 2017, Godzilla king of the monsters and Godzilla vs Kong 2021 as well as monarch legacy of monsters. Cannot wait to see this in theatres in Australia.
sagol
im going to fricking cry for house excited i am for this movie
des gros bebe chatons qui se tape dessus  🤣
This looks so cool omg
We haven’t seen Shimo except his eyes
Sempre as mesmas ladainhas
Kong's left hand got injured and he is wearing the gauntlet on his right hand??
The SHIMU has came🥶❄️🌨️🧊🏔️❄️
Absolutely RUBBISH
Looks a snoozefest
OH NO THE BABY MONKEY WAS GETTING CHOKED OMGH!
❤
Dai DC jocker Trailer Release pannuga da
trying to figure out what the ice kaiju is
this is epic looking
Best trailer I’ve seen in a VERY LONG TIME. Well done folks.
SHIMU!!!
The SHIMU has came🥶❄️🌨️🧊🏔️❄️
Haven’t had a serious villain like this since ghidorah .
les gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Kong and Infinity Gauntlet! 😆😆😆
now for the opposite of Godzilla Minus One
Is this franchise the new Transformers
And I… am… Iron Kong 🫰
Se eu ver um Fuscão Azul nesse filme, eu vou amar demais
Lets gooooooo 🔥
It makes me happy that This ridiculous movie and Godzilla Minus One are both allowed to exist at the same time. Us Godzilla fans are living our best over here
That one scene that Kong punches skar king and his tooth comes out is so satisfying
One of my wishes for this movie is the Godzilla static pose dropped kick.
who's at 1:54?
Shimu bois, we’ve seen shimu
This looks horrible. After Godzilla plus one this looks so bad
bruh the comments are alll bots
I’m still gonna watch it but Minus One set the bar so high that I don’t think I’ll get the same enjoyment
When the enemy is so powerful you need the Gauntlet...
IRON KONG
Supperrr Trailer 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 It's Gonna Makes Me Feel To Literally Given Powerful Goosebumps Of This Trailer. That Was Very Super Amazing Trailer I've Never Seen This Before. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks stupid, hopefully stupid fun.
UNA GIGANTESCA DEPOSICIÓN DE HECES PROGRE Y DESECHABLE...IACH
Was that scar king that got knocked out? If so, why did he look so small at the end was that him or no?
0:31 Godzilla VS new titan
watching these trailers turns me into a kid LOL, im so hyped
Whole movie in a trailer
big monkeh and big lizard against another big monkeh an somethin else. i fckin love it
Long live the Kings.
The gojira elements 😂
0:31 right here shimu is here..... put on stop
that atomic pulse
ഡാ സ്കാർ കിങേ 😅 നീ തീർന്നു🤣
Live long Godzilla
Forget flowers and chocolate. This trailer is the best Valentine's gift ever!
Kong and Godzilla's greatest enemy isn't Scar King, it's the construction workers around the world... 😂
"Bumblebee & Barbie." ❤️🔥😊 Husshhh!! WB didn't forget to propose on Valentine's Day.  The trailer is another reminder that 2024's summer is gonna be epic. Godzilla & Kong have already won our hearts, and I'm eagerly waiting to experience this gigantic monstrous war exclusively in theaters. The background music persuades literal gossepubumps. Remember "Just not to swallow your tongue,"  because this adventure of two great titans is kind of "they just have to work together ". Let's experience, Kong's suckerpunch with Bumblebee's hand 💛 & Godzilla's Barbie trend...💖
I wonder why can't it be simple like the og king kong
SHIMOOOOO
Its funny that the Japanese make Godzilla a serious theme while The Americans make it look like a generic anime.
Epic❤
This is going to be awesome 😈😈
Like if you rewatched this atleast 4 times.
So who’s the enemy?
im just confused as to why skar king is a threat, is he not just a godzilla size primate?? does he have weapons other than that spine whip? it would be cool if he had some other characteristics like idk atomic breath it just doesn’t make me that hyped
No one can beat king kong 2005 or 2006
I love the idea of Godzilla and Kong being great friends always looking out for each other Godzilla respecting the fact that King Kong would not yield. King Kong for standing up and saving Godzilla when he was fighting Mechagodzilla I hope what they do in the monster verse see that a bond was made their between the two of them I mean Godzilla owes kong          his life he literally saved him from Mechagodzilla and Godzilla did not kill Kong when he had the chance so now there's a Mutual respect I believe both these two Titans together as best friends and the monster verse can really go somewhere with this
Another godzilla , the blue one?
This is what you get when Hollywood can't come up with anything
THIS BOUTA BE LIT🔥🔥🔥
The battle to rule has started
no offense, but WHY PINK THO?
0:24 Girl gat a booty now 😍
Shimu destroy kong axe ,that shimu is more powerful than Godzilla
anyone else hear moist critikal in the new roar sfx
I hope sky King's treated like the cars think he's a God and they worship him
After watching "Godzilla: Minus One", this just does not hit the same. I am sure it will have a lot of CGI spectacle, but the former gave me hope for a good story as well as characters that this does not.
This movie going to destroys all  Other franchise movies  Records
Damn this is something else ❤😱
Looks like power ranger kong
So is there a villain here we have yet to see?
🔥🔥
I'm so excited to see this movie 🎬 😊
Who like godzilllllla's👇
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
This movie is gonna be a certified hood classic
#dope #letsgo
🔥🔥🔥🔥
hombre ver monstruos gigantes peleando, hombre ser muy feliz
their mums' name was MARTHA i guess..
Damn 🔥🔥🔥
0:31 it shows that scars ability is to make hollow earth portals
Mad trailer 🔥🔥
Just one word... YES!!
Best Movie Trailer 😮
Iron KONG FTW
I'm getting Kong and Godzilla tattooed on me
Godzilla fights the Planet of the Apes
im happy to be the 4283nd comment on this amazing trailer.
Godzilla never afraid Wym 😂
Ah yes finally, the good old silly mayhem.
Only Jesus of Nazareth can save us all.
So scar king isn't the final boss. There's something else hidden 0:32 we see scar king then a different face. 1:50 it looks like scar king is the same size as Kong and something bigger interrupts the fight. Something with ice powers
Wow! this trailer is insane!
I don't have any word to type in comment after watching this trailer...  Just amazing ❤❤❤
This is the first one of legendaries Godzilla movies that looks actually bad to me. After the Monarch TV series, the bar is even higher so this this endeavor which looks not nearly as good as the past four movies does not bode well
Damn everything is getting frozen this year.  Rio and then New York
Shitsu??? is real????
pink godzilla bruh 😭😭
1 like = 1 pusups 👇
2:32 - Godzilla is back with his thermonuclear explosion  I waited for this moment to see him like that after King of the Monster 🎉😊
No Shimu? 👀👀
I am sold. Will definitely watch this on IMAX!!!
Entha ippam indakki vachkkne😂
Shin victims
ขนลุกเลยคับ
When are going to move away from seeing these monsters from human's perspective we dont need the deaf girl to tell us they want to fight other monsters
We did not get a full look at Shimo but he is already scary as frost Satan
les go
looks bad
Past is very bad . present is not telling future .is my story
Shiny goosebumps
We got Super Sayian Rose Godzilla and Thanos Kong? Im in.
👇Team Kong
I just want a proper look at shimo
0:31 you can see both godzilla and kong is fighting there opponent aka scarking and shimu
Kong's punch against Skar looked brutal and I am here for it!
This movie going to be crazy
hahaha
Long live the kings!✊
I like chicken
Who is Waited for long time for it ♥️♥️
طيب ممكن يتخانقوا بعيد بس عن الهرم مصر مش ناقصة والله 😅
This will be legendary
Well, that’s new there is a new creature alongside the red Kong, but it uses ice
Nice
Skar king is cheating he has long arms
MONSTERVERSE FOREVER!!!
0:31 ?????
This looks wild🔥💪
Shouldnt kong have lightning powers
ohh they can make 1000 godzilla films i would watch them all. thats always nice.
Do you think there is CGI in this movie ?  Just asking ....
I wonder what runs in the director's head. This is crazier than my dreams.
INSANE
This will be epic! Can't wait!
The best Valentine's gift
Is necessary see Monarch to undertand this new movie?
The CGI just seems way too over kill. It might as well be a cartoon.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Its going to be Best Movie of The decade 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lets goo
How about the initializing the Jaeger Program already? These monsters are getting out of hand. 😅
Planet Of Apes and Godzilla ..We'll be there
too much tech
godzilla god y kong
wow this is the whole freaking movie!
0:31 sec fight of kaijus
Did Kong lost his hand or what
Kong gave him the noodle legs 😂
After Godzilla, kong, Godzilla king of monster, kong v. Godzilla and the amount of destruction they show that their fight does. I am having doubts on how human ki d is surviving this
2:32 oh nuclear pulse is back
Wow ❤🤯🔥
Deadpool who?
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Never thought shimu would be that big!! 0:31
This looks like one of those foreign sci-fi movies that does nothing but flex it’s cgi muscles
Shimu confirm
2:28 they gonna use that tooth to make a clone of kong Mecha Kong probably
Absolute Cinema  Kino Is Served
Epicidad everywhere!!! Es todo lo que necesito!!!
1:13 and 2:33 sounds like a distorted Charlie scream
le plus gros étron de l'année, probablement ! Enfin j'espére que personne ne saura faire pire...
Warner Brothers, you guys have absolutely KILLED IT! Im definitely seeing this, the whole trailer 1,000,000/ 10!!! I cannot wait for this, and there’s only three words to describe my thoughts right now, MIND… FREAKING… BLLLOOOWWWNNNN!!
2:26 Shimo, I see you 👀
you need to turn off your brain for this stupid movie lol
2:13 we can see shimo
Kong Thanos?
None villain can match the level of Ghidorah
Very excited ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
EPICCCC
Looks suitably ridiculous
2:47 bro casually throws a building with ppl inside and later the building gets smashed by kong... NIGHTMARE 💀
😮‍💨😮‍💨 this movie looks awful..
Mothra’s reflection in Jia’s eye
Let's go Warner Brothers 🙌🏽🙌🏽
29th march time of a blockbuster  movie of all time after avengers endgame
I just wanna see the big monkey punch the big lizard
Bro Kong out here fighting skar king and shimo at the same time in the hollow earth. Kong is a beast
O pau torando no Rio de Janeiro
i prefer minus one
Remember when Gareth Evans and Jordan Vogt-Roberts made movies that had some thought and gravitas to them? I hit me when watching this, how quickly these have become Fast and Furious.
I'm so looking forward to this wow
Hopefully we'll know how Godzilla can stand in the ocean with a depth of more than 10,000 feet.
Waitting 🥵
I already know that this video gonna get more than 10 M views so i just come here and enjoy the time where this video only had 400k ❤️🙏🏼
F**k it's not kingdom of the planet of the apes trailer ? Where is Cesar ?
nah... i didnt get chills  minus one all the way
I'm waiting for Gidhora again.
The visual noise is off the charts.

Now that's a Trailer! 👏👏
This is the only cinematic universe I care about now :)
Yeah this is just beautiful
вау
LETS GOOOO !!!!
Dude first day first show confirm 👍 this is gonna be epic battles
Seems like this movie tries to showcase another hidden world of monster just like the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters series did so perhaps serves as a period in the series?
This gonea be unreal hoepfully Godzilla in it more bc don’t rlly see him but Godzilla look awesome n so does long n skar king not as big as I thought
Littral chills
Deadpool and Wolverine trailer was already hype NOW THIS???
Long live the King of the Monsters! 👑 👹
At first I thought oh snap bumble bee is in this😂😂😂
OMG 😱
0:51  I don't think its godzilla(maybe shimo reveal) Because it looks bigger and has blue (ice) rays all over the body   And it looks awkardly different  Edit: nah it's definitely not Godzilla  It has open stomach Like you can see bones near his stomach
This movie better be 3,5 hours

Shimu gonna go crazy
Please bring back Mothra and the others
1:55 shi was so clean ..
King Kong fans hit the like button 👉
1:54 Why I'm feeling that there will be another Godzilla
I am tired of this
This looks….kinda awful. But I still want to watch it.
Dang. Kong with the infinity gauntlet is sick lol
I’m glad they referred to the Kongs as the great eight species maybe the closest we get to the great apes from Dragon Ball he just can’t shoot atomic breath from his mouth like they can
God' II ?
omg omg omg
0:30 shimo💀
Ohhh we are cooking and it's going to be amazing
I waited 2 months for this trailer..Now i got almost 1 month till the actually movie.... Im like big kid waiting for Christmas ... Godzilla/Kong  Super fan .. Super excited

This is so sick 🔥🔥🔥 loving the power fist they gave kong
Godzilla x Kong: Empire of the Planet of the Apes
I never thought I'd see the say where someone thought "Kong doesn't punch hard enough....let's give him a mech glove so he can hit harder."
Sad to see mothra is not br there
what a trash moviet after godzilla minus one , box office´s gonna be epic fail
I gotta find out why Godzilla got that Magenta glow now what upgrade he get???
i am hoping i did not just watch the whole movie 🙃
This is stupid
Wait planet of ape vs godzilla?

cgi is terrible
Under an hour gang 👇
Okay the trailer 2 hype is kinda getting on to me then trailer 1 considering that it shows alot more on scar king then trailer 1
an excellent movie is coming
Long live King Ghidorah!!!!!!!
Bingung gua, apa iya Godzilla ada 2
Do people actually care about theselame movies?
🥹 Beautiful
*crunches chips*
I didn't think they could top the final Godzilla vs Kong trailer,  but this?? This so damn epic!! I can't wait!
They show a lot in this
Is shimo freezing zilla in that Rio shot ???

0:31 shimo is massive
Im so hyped
I do wanna know why is the robotic upgrade on kongs right arm when its his left arm that got injured?
Let the two kings do they thing 😎Godzilla and King Kong fans 🎉
0:31 godzilla vs shimo
2:33 MoistCr1TiKaL made a cameo
Okay I'm height for this movie now.
Everyone saying Godzilla can’t achieve the nuclear pulse on his own. When bro just did the atomic pulse.
Shimu is not a myth anymore 🤯 (shimu exactly look like godzilla)
0:31 set video speed to 0,25. You can see probably shimu fighting Godzilla
Perfect Valentines day gift
King kong deserve to win in first one
How much void Hollywood can be? Minus one for you
The Deadpool and wolverine of the monster verse , gives me hope for 2024
Uff😻🔥
Holy moly epic movie 🍿
1:13 I love that they decided to add Moistcritikal's scream into the soundtrack.
Well. OK. A lot more Planet of the Apes than I expected. I expected 0, meaning none and this is Planet of the Apes WITH Godzilla. Why?
I hate that moist critical scream they keep editing in, who thought that was a good idea?!
I NEED IT RNNNNNN
I'm 54 and have loved Godzilla and Kong since I was 6...seen all the old movies..every version of KK...and to have what wev had the last decade is beyond exciting for me but to step in here and see how many people LOVE Godzilla and or Kong is so great!! This is going be spectacular...I can't wait!!😊
Kongs Death in end movie
dammmm
Who’s waiting for @imdontai to react to this trailer
If the Power glove is so powerful they should have made one for both hands then he’s unstoppable.
It sounds like someone is choking on the microphone in the background
This looks sooooo goood
ЭТО ПРОСТО ОХРЕНЕННО!!!! ЖДЕМ все Россией!
Godzilla and kingkong👑 fans assemble 👍👇
0:31 shimo coming to town!!!
If Kong and Godzilla ends up being fuse like Dragonball I'm gonna flip 😂
ooo myy godddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd.
2:27 YOU GET THAT SLUG IN KONG!! SHOW EM WHO'S TOP APE
im getting really tired of ferrum being used in almost every trailer
“Mini Kong” being in this is like having to bring youre little brother when you go out.  Imma still enjoy myself just wish he wasn’t there 😐
So badass & epic,I'm glad that both the us & Japan are doing godzilla perfectly at the same time,the son of kong making his return after 80+ years,new rivals that equal both godzilla & kong,now all we need is a good godzilla & komg game on consoles which hasn't happened in decades(the only new godzilla game is godzilla battle lines on Android & iPhone but on consoles we haven't had a good one in decades)these are facts.
OH IM ABOUT TO BLOW THIS IS TOO GOOD
Who's idea was it to give the monkey a powerglove?
Spoiler alert- the real villain is the San Francisco 49ers. 😎😎😎😎
looks good to watch
The mini kong is horrible asf
The nuclear pulse is back
Thanks Warner for putting humans in a movie about kaijus.
This looks fire 🔥
it looks like a VFX artist threw up and im here for it
We are making it to Tokyo with this one 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥trailer
#teamgodzilla
When creators arent creative enough to create new content they just keep recreating old content. This genre is like 100 years old. How many ways to we need to see an old japanese movie?
When do tickets go on sale
I’m not gunna say this looks awful, but it does. Every human character looks as annoying as the last one.
The way kong punch skar king and break one of hes teeths
These movies that are jaut full of cgi bore me to death
King of the monsters is BACK BABY!!!
The graphics have been downgraded and it looks childish but i literally am filled with goosebumps watching this trailerrr
BEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER
Hope this is the last film for a while because after Minus one those are some large shoes to fill. No reason to get excited just yet.
Badass
“EARTH WAKE UP WARNER BROS UPLOADED ABOUT GXK”
Looks horrible.
I really liked previous King Kong and Godzilla movies. But I think this one is too much fantasy. It becomes ridiculous and silly no longer 🫤
Sinceramente! Não empolgou quanto aos anteriores.
We are now in the Tekken Tag part of the storyline.
This will be epic 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i have goose bumps all over my body and i just got tears of pure joy when i saw all this i am so looking forward to the movie
downing a whole bottle of tequila to go see this
GODZILLA ⚡
Looks amazing 🔥🔥🔥
Yooo this new trailer is sick i'm hyped!!!!
Loading...🦍
0:31 I saw shimu just pause video or speed by 0.25x
After seeing Godzilla Minus One, this will have a really hard time living up to that. This already looks packed full of Hollywood tropes.
Monkey has no dalls😂😂
Trailer 2🔥🔥🔥 is better than Trailer 1
0:31 SHİMO SHİMO SHİMO
Amazing
Might as well have shown us the full movie. Revealed most of the plot and action in the trailer. 😂
Broo Wtff Letss Gooo Shemuu Toooo😳😳😳
Godzilla is back to blue 💙
I found that in Kong vs godzilla they humanised them too much with the facial expressions etc. Looks like they've done it again.
Team Godzilla--------------------------->
This is haaaaarrrdddddddd🔥🔥
I feel like this is going to have about 1% of the level of story that we got with Godzilla Minus One... That film is goated
Nice to see Optimus and Megatron coop.
Wished they use the  titans frm the 2nd godzilla movie, espicially behemoth.
Will yall ever make original movies again or will it just be sequel after sequel till the end of days?
Finally a hint for shimu
OMG! THIS IS SO COOL!!
UUUUUFFFF 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
its 2v2
0:31 You can literally see Shimo vs Godzilla and scark king.
Big Lizzard x Big monkey !!!!!
Can’t wait OMG OMG OMG
The first movie was amazing and now the 2nd part, I can't wait to see it.
And yet again, Legendary has managed to make me feel like a kid! This looks epic!!! We got Godzilla: Minus 1 from ToHo, and this in the same year? Oh if this is a dream, I hope I never wake up from it!
Nobody asked for it.
Godzilla 🤝 Kong
Those who think godzilla x kong new empire gonna be a Great film Say W
Op bro
LOOKS SO FREAKJNG GOOD
Amazing!!!
yooo
This will be the best Titan movie ever ❤
hey look its that one monster movie, wonder what could happen?
0:31 you can see shimo and godzilla fighting
Ansioso para assistir no cinema 🎞️🎥 👏🏽💙
I can't wait for this it's gonna be soo epic!!
Holyfuckingshit I'm gonna combust

Zilla looks weird running like a human 💀
Вот это мощь
So much revealing😢

Omg
This is a god danm cataclysm

Godzaza x King Bong
Shimu confirmed 👌
Kong bows to no one !
Does kong have the infinity gaulnlet on his arm?
Crazy how it’s GODZILLA & KONG vs KING KONG 2005😮
2:31 Please tell me this isn't Godzilla’s roar. Lol.
I just can’t wait to go to the theater to watch this movie…I just can’t wait!❤
That punch on scar king by kong was badass!!...can't even imagine how things will end up for scar king when he receives the gauntlet punch💀
whoever believes that kong will win leaves a like under this comment 👍
Oh man I can’t wait to tell my friends to look up Godzilla x Kong to see this movie trailer!
Shimu is there
1:41 this scene 💀🔥⚡
el unico universo compartido que salio bien
Guys i just noticed they are two different godzillas
Dunno if this is gonna be a "good" movie but man does this look fun
Man this looks awful. Just awful.
why do i keep heraing penguiz0's "WOAHHHHHH!!" from the "thats what weve been waiting for!" clip?
Awful.
This is so bad...
Godzilla looks insanely powerful in this
Ke se armen los putazooossss🤌🤌🤌
I’m even more hyped!
Pink and running Godzilla, only a stupid person could come up with this. And there's too much electricity in the movie
The AI is powerful in Youtube to "promote" most positive comments (and also hide their dislikes)
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💤💤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow somebody even Godzilla is scared of this Shimo must be the real deal then
Yooo this is crazy
I Hope those two guys fight Scar king like MechaGodzilla in final battle
💚🇧🇩
1:56 WE ALL SAW THAT WAS NOT FIRE THAT WAS ICE BEAM SHIMO IS BACK !!!!!! 0:31 BRO WE LITERALLY SEE HIM  And kong's face is cold
This looks like a big pile of CGI nothingness. Godzilla Minus One has set the bar too high for a mediocre and creatively bankrupt Hollywood. Fans of these movies deserve better.
amazing
This is gonna be to crazy can't wait
where we placing the parlays at …..
Anyone kind of underwhelmed that they’re just using a new original Kaiju as the villain? Maybe it’s just me but after we got Ghidorah and Mechagodzilla as the villains of the last two movies, I was kind of hoping they’d continue that trend with maybe Gigan or Destoroyah. This villain is just another ape. Kind of boring in my opinion.
I think this godzilla movie is gonna beat all the other monsterverse movies
SaiyanZilla And ThanosKong... its about to go down
They gave Kong Doomfist's gauntlet
Rise of the Planet of the Apes
Now This is called trailer

This trailer explains the whole movie .. Can't wait to see them in Cinemas
Long Lives The Gods!!!!!
our first looks at shimo and mothra!
whoever believes that kong will win leaves a like under this comment 👍
SKAR KING IS 🔥 FIRE
At 2:12, you can see Scar King observing Shimu creating the ice storm. This further shows that Scar King has some hold on the ice titan.
I do not care how cheesy it is I’m going to go see Godzilla and Kong together on the big screen.
EPIC!!!🔥🔥🔥
Without any Dialogue feel the RAGE
Waiting🎉
Why does this feel like it's the second film they've tried to make a Kong 2 💀
whoever believes that kong will win leaves a like under this comment 👍
0:30 I can see shimo vs Godzilla  I swear
oh my God ❤
2014 Godzilla still the best
Monke
Dr Skipper has been real silent since this one dropped !
whoever believes that kong will win leaves a like under this comment 👍
Epic 🔥😮‍💨
Damn 🔥
Kong made scar king into to Floyd mayweather with that punch😮‍💨😮‍💨
Kong being scared of the villain just shows us how big of a threat he is
Blue thermo Godzilla
This İs İnsane !!!
I couldn't even finish the trailer. Beyond dumb.
Pathetic...
them running looks so goofy 2:06
Why they are spoiling all the movie in the trailers?? The trailers are supossed to bring you to the cinema, not to tell you all the movie so you don't need to watch it
One of the best trailer I've ever seen this months🔥🔥it looks like there are 2  godzilla
mega blockbuster coming
a movie where godzilla and kingkong fight to the death would be better, technological devices spoil the job
It's Freakin Awesome....❤🎉
Kong facial expressions!
My. FuKING. GOD.
1:50 is the moment !!!!!
More Hollywood CGI trash...  👍
This. Looks. Stoopid
They're going full Marvel with this. Shite TV spin-offs included. 😔
A battle for the supremacy of Earth, two titans seem as gods in ancient times, whose peoples have been in a war more older than humankind himself. They fought against each other, but they unite to destroy a monster made of metal created by humans to end their domain. Together, they ended both the monster and their eternal rivalry, having peace between titans and humans. But this peace gets interrupted by an ape titan name Scar king, who self proclaims to by the all mighty emperor of the Hollow Earth, who destroys and conquers anything on his path, marking them with his bloody hands. Now the champion of humanity Kong and the king of monsters Godzilla have to fight together once again and end the tyranny of Scar King once and for all.
MONKE MONKE
i like how they casually dropped the godzilla damn neared bodied king the first time . that choreography between kong and scar king whoo wee
I will probably enjoy the movie, but I already just from the dialogue hate the human characters. They just didn't learn from Minus One, did they?
When it shows the city and statue in the background you can see the ice kaiju shooting a beam into the sky
This is the best notification I received on. My valentines day
Realism has left the chat...
when are they gonna learn that missiles and explosive doesnt work on Titans XD
Well RIP humanity, Kong found his entire gang and godzilla got a dbz transformation
Мне понравился момент,как у Конга глаза полезли , когда он там что то увидел.
I am so ready for this 💯
This smells like the showa era to me... this film doesn't seem very serious to me
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO
0:08 until the fire nation attacked.
Boring as sin and predictable.
Yey mothra is back !!
Hola no sé si habla en español pero aquí en Latinoamérica la película cuando sale?
Epic!
Freaking epic!!!!
Looks nice.  Wish they had some Toho villains in it though.  Also wish this movie should have came out before Minus One.  Feel how much that film is getting praised could actually hurt this film.  Guess will see.
Best Fighting Ever
idc I will ALWAYS watch my monster fighting movies
So Burning Godzilla confirmed after KOTM 2019?!  😮😮 why they bring God version of godzilla back?
😂😂😂😂😂😂 кринж фууууу
KONG TEAM HERE
Epic🔥🔥🔥
The best movie of 2024
Osm bros ❤❤
PAUSE AT 0:31 you can see Godzilla vs Shimu
It's just a wow🤩
0:31 is the best look at shimu
It looks silly but fun! Fun is what's missing from movies nowadays.
The duo in full of Action
I love godzilla
Phenomenal! 😍
🥶🥶
2:44 Kong is a Fallout Player confirmed
2:32 why did they put the Cr1TiKaL scream in this movie xd
2:13 Ganhemos 🇧🇷
Godzilla and Kong Soon
How is this series better than the Batman V Superman one. I mean it just blows my mind that an ape and a lizard has more chemistry and emotion than a literal god and a human.
Woooooowwww...two words.. CAN'T WAIT...😱
the Monarch series got me even more hyped for this movie!
Godzilla like I don’t submit to no one who out there challenging me
Man this is going to be GOOOOD  can't wait !!!!!!!!
...Nah
Can't wait
0:31 Godzilla vs shimo and kong vs skar
Man! This is going to be EPIC 🔥🔥🔥
They destroyed the whole USA, now they will destroy the whole LATAM
is there another godzilla? I can see blue blasts when godzilla is already pink!!
Dude, I'm so over these crazy CGI movies with zero story.
That was so good! A1. Can’t wait for the film
this looks so much fun, so freaking excited for it!!!!
So they gave kong the Infinity Gauntlet, okay i got cha
Most badass thing in trailer is Kong punch ✊ that made scar  lost sprocket😂😂
This is going to be EPIC
Yeah we are waiting for both of u guyzzz!!!!!
Damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yell I’m not the only one Godzilla looks so awsome with that blue thermo lookin stuff all over him
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I really enjoyed Godzilla vs Kong. It was a fun watch, with a good supporting cast (especially the mute girl). This looks equally promising. Fingers crossed.
Kong pluse Doomfist.
Americans once again prove they should not be in charge of the Godzilla IP, as Godzilla Minus One was 100x better than this stupidity.
Shimu was the one who froze King Ghidorah 🥶
that weird sound in the trailer that keeps happening makes me think thats Shimu's roar. That mf that old that its roar sounds like a static sound
I literally saw scar king’s tooth after when kong 🤜 him oh the face! NOW THAT A POPEYE!😡😡
gonna be awesome
thanos glove?
Titans are Guardians? More like destroyers
Outstanding 🎉❤
2:33 bro godzilla got blue thermonuclear power?!
KONG IS LOOKING LIKE THE MAN AGAIN #THANKYOU
I XANT WAAAAAAASAAAAAAAAJIT
bro is that another godzilla
Star Wars???
kong x godzilla is the duo we never think we will get
This CGI vomit is what passes for good these days.....sigh.....
damn!
MORNING FOR THE WORLD
This trailer has blown me away. I can't wait for March 29. 🤯🤯🤯  These big 4 are insanely powerful.
Lol, it looks ... how to say this .... ridiculously bad !
The CGI and the fight scenes look good, but the movie itself is a joke.
Totally epic
Rio de Janeiro 😍😍😍😍
This is gonna be epic
Kong with the Infinity Gauntlet
I’ve ascended the levels of hype
El mejor tráiler
Iron Kong 😂
I just want to see them like so that bad guy is Kong and Godzilla and star king who is the other guy oh he’s Doug
Shimo 🌬️❄️❄️❄️? 1:53
release Coyote vs. Acme!
We wanna see shimoo
2:27 has NO RIGHT TO BE THAT FUNNY 😭
Hi can any explain me why are there 2  different colored Godzilla one blue and another one pink ??
Cinema is back BABY
After godzilla minus one, this just looks sad
Godzilla 😈
This should be called Godzilla X Kong X Transformers X Pacific Rim
huh...Ghostbusters and Godzilla sharing the same ice-theme villian?????
This looks fireeeeeee 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Godzilla and kong got more personality than Captain Marvel and Echo
This is the chaos and destruction I’ve come to expect from Godzilla movies. Lol.
*screams of happiness
Now we have another greatest duo
Please someone confirm its not just kong and godzilla vs ganddaddy ape
@imstildontai
They be cooking bro
Scar king's whip are way too cool perfect for a dictator!
King of the monsters had the best trailer: prove me wrong.
MY CHILDHOOD IS CRYING IN JOY 🥹
This movie is going to be epic. It’s like Godzilla and Kong are fighting their evil twins to battle off in which titans get to rule the planet. Skar King and Shimo are going to give these two a run for their money.
I loved caseoh acting in this film ( he looked hungry)
Epic.
Kong has clearly grown in heigt and mass
I’m so hyped for this film!
Kong became Thanos 😂
Scar Kong looks scary and badass looking
2:32 kinda looks like mothra , like in kotm movie
two years ago i had a nighmare where i was sucked in a giant hole on the ground and for some reason it was like a giant tornado and godzilla and kong was getting pulled as well i know that has nothing to do with this movie but i am watching this trailer rn and i feel like jim carey in the true man show for some reason
Anyday team kong.this time kong got a upgrade ❤
gonna be fire 🔥
Obligatory blue sky beam
Don't waste your money🙂
Can y'all stop with the kids conveniently making it thru the whole movie it's hard to believe the adults y'all starting off with killing breaking bad guy made it feel like anyone can get it instead of how they gonna plot armor they way through it humans are fragile if you gonna have them 5 ft away for a fight someone or most got to go
Trying to stop shimo from making the second ice age. Calling it now
This is gonna be the dumbest movie of the year and I'm gonna love it
Hahahahaha WTF será jodidamente buena esa película
collab with planet of the apes✅
WHEN THEY’RE BOTH ROARING THO!!!!!! 🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
Hermoso , maravilloso, agresivo, espectacular, Diosssss
This movie looks so dumb…. And I am all for it. Take my money.
Congratulations, you just made a way to make Godzilla and Kong even more stupider
Too many monkeys.
Bro R.I.P the pyramids
This is going to be terrible and you can tell how many people don't know what an actual good Godzilla movie is if you're excited for this
That's Epic 🔥🔥☠️☠️
Godzilla got a new ability other than super saiyan rose wow!!!!
Like for epic
Splendid 🤌
This may sound bad but i like seeing Godzilla kill people
Shimo made kong get the leviathan axe dude. He has rhe infinity guantlet and the levithan axe
CGI still looks pretty rough. Hope this isn't final.
Pangam panni vachurukingaleda 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ебать мощь
This is going to be very good but I want to see shimuuuuu xf
Se están pasando!!!
whoever believes that kong will win leaves a like under this comment 👍
Why are people still trying to shoot Godzilla?! Have these people not learned anything?!🤣
Godzilla x kong ❤
How many historical monuments we blowing  up this time yall
So still no Shimu reveal then …
That moment where Kong punches a tooth out of Skar King, it looks like Suko was in danger. Also, Mothra being in Jia’s eyes must mean that Jia will take the place of the twin priestesses that are connected to Mothra in the Toho films.
So two new villians
I didn’t even know they were working on another film. This franchise is way better than Transformers!
Big Show and Mark Henry vs The Great Khali and Umaga 😂😂
I will never get tired of hearing that Godzilla roar ❤
Omygggoddd can't wait for the movie now
aaaa perro roñoso ya la quiero ver
I must do trailer breaksdowns for this!!!
Oh cool he got a metal arm
Shimu scene 🔥🔥
Jeez… Godzilla has some serious mental problems ._.
Get the 2014 godzilla writing team back please... I mean I will watch the movie for cool monsters & monster science nerding + the 0,1 chance of getting a 0.1 second Behemoth cameo. Just promise me you show the dude once, aye? He is magnificientooo!
Skar King looks and sounds like Beast Titan😂
Feel like just watched the entire movie in the trailer
Perfeitoooooo
This trailer makes me so proud
Witness the rise of shimo
Looks epic! Omg
TOBA Hulk would easily have Godzilla, Kong, Shimo and all the other Titans for breakfast.
Epic ❤️‍🔥
Godzilla and Kong vs Skar and Shimo, the Ice Dragon. Not bad.
Why why why why why????
The kong movie 2 Ft Godzilla
bored...fomeke....
AMBATAKAM
you can see kong vs skar king and godzilla vs shimo in 0:31
Can’t wait to see this in theaters looks insane
Wtf is this... im in
Mothra spotted 🐀🐀
Kong team.......👉✊🔥
Việt Nam chắc chắn phải đi xem hứa luôn ❤
А1хи1рен1ий дастишь фантастишь
The “it’s something there afraid of line” is painfully generic and stupid considering there’s two who would rather avoid a fight but will still roll up on a mf.
Omg this is gonna be crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
This trailer absolutely slammed all the negative comments from the fans regarding its teaser 🗿🥵
Pog
Meanwhile…humans are treated as ants.
Ppl in the building that kong just smashed with  his iron man suit hand ahhhh😑😑😑😑😑😑
In one of the shots king and sumo punch star king at the same time there really are father and son
Warner bros has had some great stuff lately. Too bad they didn't figure out dc stuff.
Shimo looks so good
2:26, if you slow it down you can see scar king holding suko
Shimo confirmed!
Protect are Humanity ❤❤❤
There are too many straight white men in this trailer.
Bro threw a building…. Kong punched the DOG WATER out of Scar King😷
When Kong or Godzilla are on screen, nothing can hype me more up. They are rulers of cinema. They are peak entertainment
👑 GODZILLA 💪
NO WAY
balli gad ki bulli ledu, kong mawa ki tirugu ledu.. jai kong jai jai kong
Kong badass in trailer 😎
This is the real War of Titans I have been waiting for!
Cannot wait for this. Looks epic 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So cool Kong is Transformer Hahaha 😂 he has robot arm that wicked cool and funny
muita firula pouca historia!!Minus One muito melhor!!!
Please please please, no cringy teenager scenes traveling across the country to do who-cares-what. Just show monsters fighting.
This is the stupidest trailer of the stupidest movie
This trailer is better
2:31 NUCLEAR PULSE BABY 🤩☢️
@1:26 moist critical scream
Ok so kong goes in to hollow earth to deal with his family issue and godzilla came to destroy his family to eradicate danger leading them to work together to destroy the main bully in family ----THE PLOT 🥲✔️
TeamGodzilla
THIS IS LOOKING CRISPY
My boy Kong better knock Godzilla tf out atleast once.
SHIMU is here
0:31 Shimo first full body 😆😆😆
2:27 punch haha
It’s awesome 🤩 0:31 Godzilla & Kong vs Skar king & shimo. 2:32 Godzilla brings back the thermonuclear explosion like the same one in Godzilla King of the Monsters 2019 but with blue explosion electricity energy. Godzilla & Kong Roaring 2:52 spoiler alert‼️Mortha behind while Godzilla & Kong roaring in Egypt desert 🏜️
HOLY LITERALLY HOLLY SHEEEET
The shimo reveal is unreal
monke😊
is that chen fa lai from tvb
This type of trailers needs to stop. I swear every single one are doing this.
Oh damn, Godzilla's gonna evolve Ig from the blue powers to the magenta color. And the scene so clearly showed that Godzilla can do nuclear pulse without any extra nuclear power. Ya it's weaker than the one in KOTM but it's still more than effective in a fight. It's gonna be grt!!
m pgl ho jaunga ye movie dekh ke really excited
Honest to God I have no idea what's going on....looks interesting though
Finally ❤😮
You know something epic is going to go down when both kong and godzilla gets a power up. This movie is going to be fire.
Now this trailer answers a few questions. Can't wait!!!!!
Hype!
Ager main hota to elon musk ke sath mangel ke liye plan teyar krta
Thats way better than first one
KONGGGGGG COME ON KONGGG KILL SCAR KING
is that sound effect literally moist critical screaming? lol
Nooooo parece transformers de michael bay se ve buenisima
la big bagarre
THIS LOOKS EPIC!!!
@2:27 you can see kong save the little monkey from scar king literally before he knocks his tooth out. Absolutely epic
This one requires you to turn off your brain first!
1:53 It's Shimo, I know it is because of the ice effects
I am fully erect
All I wanted was a full reveal of Shimo, I'm devastated! 😭
This is starting to look like Pacific Rim 2
Looks like another cgi garbage
Wow!!! This move is gonna be crazy!!!
Take myoney now
I mean it's awesome 😍😍😍
This looks great!
Annoying over blast
Alright this trailer showed me the entire plot, guess i dont have to see the movie now.
March 29th can't come any sooner 😁🔥🔥🔥
I knew Shimo had to be here cause ain’t no way Scar King fighting Godzilla and Kong together
better than the game tho
So elegant. So beautiful. Just looking like a wow!!
from a giant monster series to a giant superhero series, what has the monsterverse turned into
This is rediculously Epic!
Team Kong,  till the end
1:13 Imagine if that 'soundwave warble' according to the subtitles was actually made by a raging gamer screaming into a really really bad mic. Maybe Wizardyensid, who knows?
On 0:30-31 Godzilla and shimo fighting on right side
I'm definitely going to see this movie
“Somethings coming”  Im coming
Where’s milly
Sathyam parayalo , nalla oombiya avastha ayind 🔥
Godzilla is fckin king broski
Hey..  _That's pretty good!_
Yes
it's gonna be so awesome
All the positive comments are from people with IQ lower than room temperature
I’m so hyped for shimo! 🧍🏿‍♂️
I'm so excited! Especially if Mothra shows up. Just please don't make the people in this movie stupid, okay, guys?  Guys?  Please, I can't afford to get kicked out of the movie theater again.😢
no entiendo nada
Kong sir fans assemble ✋
Cristo rey...😮
0:29 Slow down the video and look at Jia's eyes reflection... Is that Mothra?
Yeah 😎💘
Bruh both charging together is soo fire , gave me goosebumps
why does it feel like kong is always getting done dirty
From the MCU movie is 3hrs lengthy
One of the first viewers...I love you warner bros
I am excited to see again Godzilla and kong ❤️🤩
0:30 you can see shimu and godzilla in the top right
ma boy godzilla with super saiyan rose lets gooooo
#ReleaseCoyotevsAcme
Sooo skar king might not be the big bad by the looks of this trailer
Scar King & shimu vs Godzilla & King kong
2005 graphics were better
Ну я правда в восторге,я ждал Дэдпула и был рад,а когда увидел это, интересно, прикольно. Я буду ждать.
If the bond between godzilla and kong get stronger then no kaiju could kill these 2
This reminds me of the original trailer for KOTM. It showed Millie Bobbie Brown having a special connection to Mothra, and gaining special psychic powers. I guess they scrapped it because the final film was totally different than the original trailer I watched.
thats is 100% GOD SHIMU !!!
This is not just trailer this is goosebump
Finally, more Skar King action
That was Epic🤩🤩
😂😂
Shimu is being built up to be the scary indestructible final boss, I can't wait to see him in action
Kong has a silver tooth now when he punches the building with the beast glove
GODZILLA
como se o rio precisasse de mais essa para destruir.
How did this franchise go from the darkness, grittiness of Godzilla (2014) to this in only 3 movies…
Not really liking direction here….they’ve finally jumped the shark with this latest movie
What a load of garbage
This looks like it’s really leaning into making the movie fun - like a rollercoaster ride. Instead of getting too hung up on trying to make us care about the humans. I thinks it’s going to be great!
I thought they said it’d be less humans
This movie will be extremely “meh” like the rest
needs Gigan
Damn how many fabulous costume changes is Gozilla gonna go through in this musical. What a Prima donna
Finally Warner brothers introduced SHIMU 😳😳
I like the part where Kong was like  “And I am Monke” *snaps fingers and saves the universe*  Can’t wait to see this movie 😂
yo
Looks awful
It's a Blockbuster ❤
Kong godzilla encore avec une gamine vous nous faites chier
@2:27 even little Suko’s getting in on the action!
2:31 that charging scene 🥵
Caraca o filme vai se passar tambem no rio de janeiro 😮
Kong got the infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved super saiyan rose. this is gonna be epic
it’s a pure goosebumps🔥🔥
I'm already very excited
The less people in these films the better.
showa era❤💔
porra q trailer insano tomara q seja melhor q o godzila vs kong pqp
0:31 if yall wanna see Shimo 😮
Se ve chafa
So dumb
Waiting 😈
Shimu confirm and trailer will break the internet
1:48 It's That Shimu ? Edit:WOW 133 LIKE, THANKS
Godzilla and Kong working together I love it. This movie is going to be insane!
finna go wild
This trailer makes me so happy. Ill be there opening night🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Can not wait to see Gman destroy everything
Goofy ahh story
Yes siiir
omg 😲
Ese CGI se hace ver ehh!!
СЛАВА МНЕ
2v2 YESSSIIRRR
Shimo ❤❤
This looks like garbage
Excited parahhhhhh!
0:30 Shimo
this put a smile in my face
omg 1,omg2,omg3,omg4.....que criativos
KOng is gonna rock..
missed op of calling a Baby Kong instead of Mini Kong lol
Good ❤
Long waiting 😍😍
Waiting ❤
Planet of the apes with a laser lizard. Way to go.
Godzilla and Kong more powerful than ever before. This is going to be epic
2:23 is it Tom hiddleston ???
Loved the part when Skar King says, "I am inevitable" and then Godzilla and Kong both responds, "And we...are...king of the monsters" to Skar King and defeats him together.
Look so f****** stupid
Kong beating Godzilla this time 😗
Just take my money now please!!!
WHAT HAPPENED TO GOJI
Knocked the tooth out his mouth💀  Man this movie is gonna be insane. 😭
Looking Gooood😃😀
I’m bouta bust
Jumping the shark stage
My shimu boys...
look for shimo funko it was spoiled like 15 days ago or something with the upcoming funko line for the movie
This looks so good
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤟🤟🤟🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks like a mashup of Planet of the Apes, Star Wars, with a little Ironman thrown in. I mean, seriously, Kong now has a Tony Stark glove thing? Hope the movie will be epic but every one of Legendary's movies EXCEPT FOR SKULL ISLAND WHICH IS INCREDIBLE, have been hard to watch.
Let's freaking GO!!!!  This is gonna be epic! The two strongest forces of nature working together against a malevolent tyrant. Seriously cannot wait for this movie!
오씨발 윈가드갓동님😍😍
0:30 mothra's face 1:25 mothra's egg
There's Godzilla minus one on one side, then there are these movies, leaning more and more towards Marvel or Fast and Furious type. Why can't they just keep the tone of these movies like the first Godzilla or Kong movie in the series?
EVERYONE SLOW DONE THE SPEED OF TJE VID YOU WILL FIND SHIMU AND GODZILLA FIGHTING
I can't handle how epic and wild this looks. 🤩
Why didn’t they put this out during the Super Bowl,made us wait 3 months for a another trailer smh
final teaser godzilla vs shimu
Ok I really liked GvK but this looks like too much for me I don't know how to explain it
Kong face when he saw shimo was like "Aint no way they got me squaring up with this big ahh ice breaker"💀
This will definitely be one of the movies of all time
can't wait to see gauntlet kong is c*mming
2:25 did anyone notice mini kong
Looks amazing.
🦎 x 🦍
CGI has gotta be bad for your eyes
Sheemo looks freakin' huge compared to the G man- U can see him on the 30sec mark.
That shot of Skar king losing his tooth was awesome but should’ve been saved for the actual film
I'm so hyped for this
it's just wierd yet interesting lol
Can’t wait
With the budget they have the CGI looks like a cartoon.
Bros gonna destroy the city and kill people and call themselves heroes, what is this? man of steel
Where was shimo?
Yooooo
mever stop making these movies dont care how stupid the story is, kong and godzilla is evergreen
1:53 wait who is That Bro????
aint no way this movie is coming to my birthday 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
2:26 I don’t think I have ever seen a titan ever get put to bed like that before 😂
Let's gooooooooooo
0:30 Nuclear Pulse goes crazy
Deadpool n this movie will be my favorite
This were the fun begins
Its more better if Kong and Godzilla make a baby
Nah
35 minutes
Что за мода пошла на глухонемых женских персонажей?
Woooohhh!!!! Can't wait to see it!!! It looks cool!!
Lets go Jackie Chan & Chris Tucker.
Amazing ❤😊
"The Kaiju Guys"
Still don't like the pink on Godzilla, I'm sorry.
Skar King using that whip like ghost rider lmao
This looks epic!
This is a much better trailer than the first
The cgi for the apes is sadly not even on par with older planet of the apes films… however this is one of those films that will be good mindless fun!
I can't wait this going to be fun and hilarious 😂😂😂
Lo esperaba tanto este segundo tráiler ❤🤯
2014 - Let them fight 2019 - We join the fight 2021 - Stop the fight 2024 - They can't fight alone
CGI better be dope at release 🤞
It would be super cool if we ever got a minute of an aerial pov, showing all the monsters fighting at once like in the video games. A nice callback while also showing the chaos and destruction that multiple kaijus can cause
31 seconds you can see Shimo and Godzilla and Shimo is not small at all 😭
1:43 The Skar king may have less muscle mass than Kong but he is a better fighter. Also primates in the really world that have skinny arms have something called “fast twitch muscle fibres” which explains how Gibbons move so fluidly.
Ok, this looks SICK. I can't wait for this movie.
Mechakong lol
shimo appears on 0:30 , 1:53 and 2:13
KONG IS KING 🎉
Where's Doug!!!!!!
I think the reason why Godzilla started glowing blue and obtained a pulse had to do with the Hollow Earth energy. And then later be gets frozen by Shimo and uses all the Hollow Earth energy he has left to evolve into his new form.
I swear godzilla ain't an animal anymore but a cgi Hollywood actor. Cmon why ruin a monster verse when their actions are so predictable and clearly scripted. Please I know it's a different universe but learn from minus one or the 2014 godzilla. What next? They will warp into the marvel universe,?
That other godzilla is the shin godzilla right? 🤔
Historical moment in monstervers
Mad Trailer .. Awesome !!
I AM SEATED FOR THIS ONE!!
Shimooooooo
Like pokemon
Shimo vs Godzilla,hope they don't disappoint us
Seeing a gaint ape get his tooth knocked out, true definition of badassery
I need this too be 10% human and 90% monkeh and lizard
At this point Godzilla is goku of the monsterverse .
Hopefully it isn't a rushed mess like GvK was.
Ok I’m sold, let me pre order my tickets now!
Is nobody gonna mention the zero gravity. Those leaks were confirmed. There are gonna fight in zero gravity. (If ur wondering look at the clip of suko throwing the rock at that ape, that ape is floating in the air).
The only saga that's getting better everytime.
Goofy
Kothin❤
monke
Monsters into Super heroes😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Legend will be a movie
Việt Nam ạ ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Похоже что у главгада тоже есть  свой годзи)
IS THE TRAILER WONDERFULD NEVER SEE 🔥😈😈
Legendary!❤
I ll wait till godzilla go multiversal
Did anyone else see shimus head and tail on 2:27
I paused it during the haymaker scene.  It seems like King Kong is fighting Skar King with the little kong.
Lets get ready to rumble!!!!!
Kong fans🔥
Yawn
Movie could be way better in my opinion
Epic 😎😎🔥🔥🔥
I’m So Happy for the Monsterverse
Godzilla, Long Live the Godking!
Neat
Please, please, please, keep the dumb humans to a minimum. Give me all the kaiju goodness
Oh my Godzilla
Boy, you guys are in for a Treat!
I swear at 0:33 you can hear mothras screach
Shimo sec 0:31
🔥🔥🔥🔥🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I don't like a Kong
Im so hyped
Team kong...Always💪🏻🙌🏻
1:30 kongs fear in his eyes, shimo's beutifull dangerous eyes. that just so insane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
cast for female scientist just too old n ugly there are thousand of hot actrss on hollywood and they choosed her
Shimu?
Shimu is here
Kong is gonna go full on Mike Tyson with that gaunlet.
What I don’t understand is why are all the Jets shooting at Godzilla at the end
Oh my goodness 🤩
Between “Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire”, “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes”, and “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire”, this is becoming the year of Apes and Empires….and I’m here for it! 😆
in the trailer, the left hand was wounded, and the iron hand was on the right...
I feel so lost when everyone here is referring to a "Shimo" character as if it's a long-established franchise mainstay.
There is a 3rd monster at 1:53 those blue eyes
To much 2:51 🦍❤️‍🔥
Absolutely can't wait for this!!🤪🤯🤯🤯🤯
0:30 The Queen Returns!
Godzilla jogging is just so funny to me
This looks promising
Looks absolutely dumb.... What a silly direction to go.... This movie will probably tank at the box office.
The world of apes x Godzilla x kong
But will this be better than Madame web?
IM SOOO HYPED FOR THIS MOVIE!!! SO MANY THINGS ARE HAPPENING!!!!  I SWEAR AS SOON AS THIS DROPS IM EXPEDITIOUSLY BOLTING TO THE THEATER.   I also love godzillas' nuclear pulse returning from the heisei era at 2:32 !! (At least i think is was)
It seems that humans will finally do something useful
YOOOO THAT WAS AMAZING BROOOOO
I just don't have words to describe it, totally in shock
This Big Kong Lost his teeth😂 2:26
I’m so confused why are they fighting again? In which timeline does this take place in? because there’s the Japanese Godzilla minus one and then there’s the monarch series on Apple TV
Shimoooooooooo
Lame. I miss the darkness of ,2014 Godzilla
1:43 i think at least physically Kong's stronger than Scar. Pushing Scar down with just 1 Arm on the Axe.
3 minutos de puro sexo
Does no one else get generic superhero vibes?
bruhh
The fear he looks to have at his eyes when is shimo appearing
THAT WAS SO SICK BROOO Is it just me who thought in slow mow when scar king was jumping in his like cave the titans next to him look like chimps and notice at the start how the it said great apes thats defo referring to something 👀 and i dont think Suko is good he loterally threw a rock at a fellow kong
BRO IS NOT THERMO GODZILLA
Going to be One of the best theatre experience of the year❤❤❤❤
Hmmm monke
porra chega de filme de kingkong pelamordedeus, tá pior q os vingadores
Damn this trailer was dope ! I’m so hyped for this movie 🔥🔥🔥
what is with godzilla and bridges
The thing Kong seen is either another Mechagodzilla, or Godzilla species.
Nothing beat the godzilla 2019
I can’t wait!!!!
Lol
Godzillas pulse is what the MV needs
kong x godzilla 💥💥💥💥
2024 is insane year all these moves 😮
I am in ❤
*DREAD IT, RUN FROM IT. DESTINY ARRIVES ALL THE SAME*
Deadpool and Wolverine together Godzilla and Kong together  I am very excited for the upcoming movies after a long time Who else  👇
I'm glad to see Kong isn't alone anymore there are so many more of his kind. But man I gotta say that red Kong would give anyone nightmares.😱
🩷🖤✊️🎉🎉
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG THIS IS GOING TO BE EPIC!!!!!
2:38 THE BABY IS A MENACE 🤣🤣🤣
YEASSSSSSS
Kong with the infinity gauntlet
The only good franchise out there right now.
I’m a bit disappointed we didn’t get a good official look at Shimo here. However, I do think that’s a good thing so the hype can increase further until the movie comes out
Goosebumps
Monkee.
Monster verse is miles better then anything in the MCU rn
Eh...the moment they turned this into Fast and the Furious I checked out. Doesn't look like this is any different. The feeling of dread or threat has been completely sucked out of the franchise so that's a pass for me.
Kong+ iron Man= ironkong 😅
Yesss
."They fighting another monkey what the heck 😂😂😂
pause exactly at 0:31, all 4 of them fighting in the city 👀
I can’t wait see it in theaters it’s going to awesome!! 🤩
Idh endh myrrr😂
Now that's was epic 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Maybe we can see two Godzilla one is pink and the other one is light blue something maybe i don't know
Looks an absolute mess.  Wish they would make it simple. Monsters vs monsters.
Brazil
erm yeah cool trailer but.. WHERE IS MY BOY DOUG??
So Kong is now Doomfist huh
Esto va hacer emocionante 😎
This looks so good
This is going to be nuts!
Nonsense breeds more nonsense.
This proves that Godzilla can have a nuclear pulse like hesei
So is the game Overwatch getting a Doomfist/Kong crossover? LOL
Yo there's 2 Godzilla one pink & one iced at 0:30
Bro, I’m so freaking hyped for this!
The sound effect before Godzilla's atomic breath is just amazing.
The boys are back in town
❤ 🔥
absolute blaster!
Thanos Kong and saiyan godzilla let's go!!!!!!!!!
Well, the monkey has an Infinity Gauntlet.
I think I just got ADHD
Will Godzilla and Kong only appear together now, or will they ever have their own stories again?
The CGI loooks really bad
Efectivamente, es cine
Great apes might be an understatement
🔥
This trailer shows why Minus One is superior.
best trailer i ever seen
Tralier was a blast can not wait  29 dec😮
Super saiyan rose🔥
Now, that is an action-packed trailer. 🎬
ゴジラが体内放射してる！？ 強化アーム無い方で殴るの草
Can't wait for another disappointment
Woow
I am so hard right now
Team kong🔥
hum
thermo godzilla -> electro godzilla
Having grown up with Showa, I love this.
Don’t care what ppl say. This looks fun. The monsterverse is fun
Solid
WHERES DOUG!?
Ooooooooooo😮
Kong with Goozilla, what a Combo....
i dont like godzilla running like humans
this trailer proves the leaks right. godzilla and kong will fight and kong will beat godzilla with the glove. epic
So it looks to be like Kong will be taking on the main big bad, Skar king. Whilst Godzilla is taking on shimo, The other villain. This is hype!
One of the greatest Valentine's gifts!
Ohhhh, this is gonna feel EPIC in theatres..❤❤
Everybody gangsta till the guy playing Godzilla inflates into the suit…
The countdown begins...
THIS GOES HARD
43 day's..❤❤❤❤❤ I'm waiting..
And the legacy continues.
Here before this reaches a million views
not enough CG
Big monkey has power fist from Fallout. Red monkey has whip to... I'm not saying the next part.
Goku vs vegata live action fight finally released 🙌
Can't wait for the Movie
After seeing Godzilla Minus One in theatres, I'm honestly probably gonna wait until this one comes to Netflix to watch it. I'm not saying this movie will be bad, but Minus One, even with as little promotion as it had, already seems better. I'm glad WB is bringing attention to Godzilla, but the monster verse just isn't really my thing. But still, good to see more Godzilla Movies.
Destoroyah should be the thanos of the monsterverse the ultimate villain to end this saga
Script seems way better than GvK. Overall, has me bit more interested. Comparing both trailers, imo the first one really didn't hit. This one, kinda does. I'm not excited for it but I am more interested than I once was.
P H E N O M E N A L
Se me puso dura de la emoción
Can’t wait for this movie🔥
Director confirmed he will be directing Godizlla vs Kong Part 69.
The moment where Kong knocks out Scar's tooth is simply the BEST MOMENT OF THE ENTIRE TRAILER. with AMS99W we can achieve something for real, don't skip that
shimu 😳
Kong got the infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved super saiyan rose. this is gonna be epic with AMS99W arriving the best is yet to come, you should know that!
Shimu 0:31
Trailer is really really 🔥🔥🔥 Soooooo much excited 😍
1:13 mano esse grito do Shimo tá bizarro, o bicho nem apareceu mas só o seu grito já dá medo.
Yoooo this is sick. Shimo and Scar King vs Kong and Godzilla
Godzilla and Kong vs Scar King will be the greatest battle in the monsterverse you joined AMS99W too?
I see shimu head and tail in 2:27
Kong-Buster
Ok wow
This movie is all about the stupid and the wacky. Its gonna be a fun ride boys.
That haymaker Kong gave Skar King was vengeful after his arm injury with AMS99W we can achieve something for real, don't skip that
I can’t wait for this to come out
Kong punching a whip thrown building with his new infinity gauntlet is my favorite part.❤.  This looks fun 👏
2:34 Omgg new ability of our G man?❤❤😮😮
Gotta love how these movies just keep getting crazier and crazier. Embrace the Chaos!
Godzilla and Kong working together. This movie is going to be AWESOME!!! you got me with AMS99W! That was the best idea you ever had!
Thank you godzilla for visiting egypt
Planet of Apes with big monkeys!
Godzilla and Kong looks like goku and vegeta
1:50 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
This should go on a never ending series ❤
Alright everyone. To hype up this movie, reply on my comment for every insane feat you want Godzilla and Kong to have in this movie!  Mine is that Godzilla absorbs the energy of the Hollow Earth and blows up a Moon or a Planet with his Atomic Breath.
യാ മോനെ 🤩 വേറേ ലെവൽ theatre experience കാണാൻ ആരൊക്കെ വെയ്റ്റിംഗ് 🔥🔥 This is gonna be Epic !! 🔥🔥
So... Where is shimu?
Infinity Gauntlet Kong🦍 & Pink Ranger Godzilla⚡ VS Scar King Telekinesis💀 & Shimo's Ice Breathe❄
Nahhh this movie finna be sooo tough
this was really amazing! im so excited to watch the movie!
Goosebumps🔥🔥🔥🔥
how many times u gonna reboot that damn franchise ?
Skar King stay looking like a menace
Faltó morsilla
That punch was personal 🥶🥶
THIS IS SOOO FKIN DOPE !! I CAN'T WAIT 🔥🔥🔥
Beat movie
yo, there's a new kaiju. Thank god, i wasn't sure how the Skar King can defeat both kong and godzilla
They are better when they remain natural and fight with bare hands. Adding technology made this over-fictional and boring. Kong looks like iron man now😢
Looks soo dumb, american cinema is in trouble .
Thats Amazing.
Kong And Godzilla!! Team Up!
You know what I think that scene of Godzilla and Kong running together is them chasing after Shimu and Skar king
This is gonna be epic
I'm godzilla
This has gone to far. It's just to much at this point. Laughable
Trailer looks like skippable mobile game ads
ON MY GOD And I thought the first trailer was amazing but this one is AWESOME It proves that this movie is going to be more awesome then I thought GODZILLA and KONG FOREVER !!! Let's hear it for the kings of the titans  (i wish Madison was here though)
This is gonna be good❤
HYPEE, CANT WAIT
Kong absolutely mollywhopping Skar King in that one shot is genuinely hilarious I can’t wait to see it in theatres
Not going to lie I really wish they went more the horror/thriller route with the modern day kong/godzilla movies (like the 2005 king kong vibe) instead of these lifeless, fast and furious, marvel-esque movies that have zero emotional depth.
😍😍😍😍
Godzilla ❤
Again They're coming back Godzilla X Kong
❤️‍🔥Setes Fine Trailer❤️‍🔥
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Cool but i missed where there was a story behind the movies and not a random bro fight
va a ser una reverenda cagada, pero me va a gustar igual, y la pienso ver más de 100 veces n.n
Wah bhai wahh😊
Its funny how the monsterverse manage to give their creature emotion through their facial expression. Something Disney Lion King LA couldn’t.
Trailer 2 now!
I hope that the final trailer reveals more about Godzilla actions. I'm so hype. When godzilla rises and runs, it still gives me chills. Long live the king!
Titan Shimu🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Brothers of destruction 🔥
Kong🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Qué maravilla 😍😍😍
One of my favorite tropes in media is the "x is thought to be unique and powerful, but are part of a race/culture of others just like them if not stronger than them and must fight them" like Omni-man vs other Viltrumites, Venom vs other symbiotes, now Kong vs other large apes like Skar.
Lame
es un monton
I want scary things in this trailer.... I want to see terrible Godzilla x Kong..  please make terrible monsters and very horror films for monsters
Ok let's go
This is actual 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gaand faad trailer bhai
It's will very interesting film
This shi t looks Legendary
SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMUUUUUUUUUU
Ah, G man has unlocked nuclear pulse, good to see.
So that's why they released it on Valentine's Day. It's going to be Godzilla and Kong enemies to lovers. Very smart Warner Bros.
Godzilla X king vs lanky kong
Is EPIC trailer
Shimu and Mothra??? 🫠🫠🫠
Now this is how a trailer should look like💀
Cheesy.....🧀
At least they aren’t spoiling the entire film by also showing Shimu.
SHIMUUUUUUU
And here we go having the focus of the movie be on a kid, smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Love the trailer music, does anyone recognize it?
I want jack syider❤❤❤❤❤❤
The fire blazing GODZILLA that deep fried king Ghidorah>>>>
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😅😅😅
Pinky & gaunlet gonna fight together, epic.
MONKE
0:30 GODZILLA 0:50 OMG THAT'S FCKING BEAUTIFUL  2:20 YEAH BOI!! 2:31 OMG WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SHOT. I must need that as wallpaper. 2:32 HE CAN DO THAT?!? I'M GOING TO WATCH THIS TRAILER 20 TIMES MORE!!!
My brain is telling me this is going to be really dumb. But my body won't stop getting goosebumps. I've dubbed this feeling the Godzilla factor.
Vamos Don king kon
Is it me or when you pause and click this timestamp 0:31, you can see two Godzillas, one pink and one blue
Godzilla looks like a walking Christmas tree
Fastandfurius presents  godzillaxkong
This is EPIC!
Man I remember when Hollywood used to make good movies.
MOTHRA IS BACK: freeze the frame of the close up of Jia's eye at around 0:30
Villian is cheap
The humans in those american Kaiju movies makes me sick and bored.
Powerfull trailer.....  😢powerfull enemies
i love it but my only complaint is that they dont look like they have weight despite being over 300 feet tall but thats just a nitpick
Badass kong das 🔥
Kong x Godzilla x Planet of the Apes x Transformers
WrestleMania 40 Main Event:  Godzilla and Kong vs. Skar King and Shimu   For the NO DISQUALIFICATION...    UNDISPUTED HEAVYWEIGHT TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP
2:52 that's the end of the movie
Bro this looks so cool.
Best!!!!
Hollywood is obsessed with the Egyptian pyramids and they always appear in movies either destroyed or being destroyed. I think they actually want to wipe them off the ground.
OHOOOOOOOOOO
Yooooo the new fully atomic godzilla is sick
Godzilla in blue, in pink and so many more. Even giving off lightning blasts like King Ghidorah. Awesome.
It's so DUMB, i LOVE it!!!!
Oh, my god, esto va a ser epico papus
Best trailer in monsterverse 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeah, im telling you the truth, that I love this
2024 gonna be the year of movies 🔥🔥
OMG I LOST MY KONG TOY AND I FOUND IT AFTER FINISHING THIS TRAILER….       GXK HAS BLESSED ME.
👌🏼
Godzilla Minus One was like the original. Terrifying. Awe-inspiring. Dark.  This? This looks like an amazingly cheesy fun time, like the movies that followed the original, and I cannot wait to see it. 😂
Вселенная монстров превратилась в какую-то клоунаду, вместо приземленной научной фантастики😔😔😔
Vou chorar no cinema 😂😂😂
Godzilla fans & Kong fans prepare to go war against Skar King and his army🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro..., there are 2 Godzillas !?
Mmmmm I’m gonna c💦m  This is too good
1 hour gang 😂
This is CRAZYYY bro
I can't wait till it comes out I want to go see it
And back to the theaters we go!
It’s like Hobs and Shaw, the monster version
I like Kong's new iron man Infinity gauntlet metal claw arm looks pretty freaking cool it's too bad he isn't going to be collecting any infinity stones at all from inner earth so he can rule them all 😂 the titans that is.
2:53 It gives goosebumps 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 #risetogether ⚡🔥
GODZILLA FINALLY HAS HIS NUCLEAR PULSE AGAIN WOOOOOO
Is that supposed to be Space Godzilla?
Looks more like Kong 3 (featuring Godzilla)
I hope Kong and Gozilla get married!!!
this franchise is wholeheartedly what de DCU couldve/shouldve been, it all look freaking great
2:53🤌❤
1:55 Damn, Shimo is going to be an absolute unit
This will be epic 👍
So they decided to hide Shimo and Edit out Mothra,Nice try this is just like Godzilla Vs Kong. I'm so excited for this!!.
2 movies I'm hyped for this year. 1) Godzilla X Kong 2)Deadpool & Wolverine
♻
thanks for the trailer I'm in history
Hope its as good as Godzilla Minus One ! am excited !!!
bro I was bored just looking at the trailer. If I end up watching this in theaters I’ll end up in a coma for sure.
ELECTRIC GODZILLAAA🤯🤯🤯
I'm so f@¢kin ready for some big ole monster fights LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO!
Godzilla sprinting honestly makes me not want to watch this. Same mistake Pacific Rim 2 made. They make the monsters lose all their size and presence! The first godzilla nailed that
Godzilla and Kong is going to be my coolest movie review!
Finally ❤
Monke Will RIse
Where's Dr. Keiko?
Men I'm so hyped for this movie😂😂
He broke his tooth bruhhhh🦷🦷🦷🦷 😂😂😂😂
It looks ridiculous, terrible, and mad... and I cannot wait to see it! 😆
OMG BROOOO THIS IS FIREEE🔥🔥🔥
already leak😂😂😂😂
0:31 if u slow down you can clearly see godzilla fighting this new ice titan
Honestly wasn't at all hyped for this until this full trailer (I'm the biggest gfan/kaiju fan I know).  Now I'm totally down for the show!
avoid watching if you suffer from epilepsy! I lost count of the flashing quick cuts, loud 'bwaaah' sounds, and drums, it's like the director has ADHD lol..... Why do american action movies think audiences can't focus on a scene for more than 2 seconds?
2:32 - Godzilla is back with his  thermonuclear explosion I waited for this moment to see him like that after King of the Monsters  🎉😊
Why do keep hearing moist criticals scream?
Holy fk I was wrong this is gonna be great
I love the part where Kong says "Its Kongin time" and Kongs all over. Truly a moment. Sooo excited for this movie 😍😍😍
This is pretty epic I’m just so confused about so many things. But i think my questions will be answered and clarity will be shown in this film to my confusion
Long live the monsterverse
The was badass and a better gift than valentine's day
WHERE IS THE JOKER TRAILER CMOOON'
looooooooooks peak
This looks amazing 🔥🔥🔥
2:12 😳🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Background music is boom it's like Indian music boom bum
Yessss can’t wait!!!!
hay que verla
Kong and Skar King throwing hands look absolutely fantastic, can't wait to see them in action.. I literally don't care about anyone else
Godzilla M.V.P 🔥
Yoo godzilla can do his own aoe blast now without the power boost from mothra
Where is pj
kong അണ്ണൻ ഫാൻസ്‌ ലൈക് ചെയ്യൂ 🤸
So this movie is  Kong hero and Godzilla side hero(extra character)
oloko...
Looks trash. Just as the last one
LFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Last scene 🤯🔥
So epic can’t wait
please stop with these.
bro got the infinity gauntlet
That gauntlet is so cheesy I hate it
f this man i am not watching a superhero movie    2014 way better in every dimension
This is gonna be sick ngl
Looks like dumb fun, im game.
mfs collabing against the beast titan.
GODZILLA LOOKING BADASS
kong vs scar king and godzilla vs shimo
Rise together or fall alone.
Nope
hate these movies bc the plot revolves more around the actors than they do godzilla and the big monkey
This gunna be movie of the year!!!
god this looks dumb.... and I loved the 2016 reboot and KoM
Wow!!! This is gonna to be the best Godzilla and King Kong movie ever made in the monsterverse. This is gonna be awesome and epic!!! 2:04 2:52
damn Kong did Skar King teeth dirty
The moment Godzilla became thor 😏
So, Godzilla is getting both pink and blue color
Now this is way better than the first trailer
What?
Who are ready to loose whole world, only if they can see godzilla for once....❤❤❤
I see shimu
2:50 ROCKET PUNCH
1am here in the Philippines 🇵🇭
This is gonna be sick ngl!
I’m ready
Trying to  seek people's  publicly opinions....do y'all think that the monster verse franchises such as this one is doing better than marvel atm(I'm a marvel fan).Because I think it's goin to be great so far from what I am seeing.🤩
just give kong the giant iron man suit already, he would be thanos😂
0:30 godzilla x shimu, scar king x kong and a big explosion
Heck yes !
يا ساترررررر 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks awful...
hard
The way suko tells kong, there's some baddass color orange guy
Godzilla used Electric pulse
Looks SICK. Just hope the human characters have a little more depth this time. We got spoiled with Minus One’s insanely good writing and acting
Iron kong😂
Decoding processing bro @mokka commentry
Man sees monsters, man happy
I literally can't wait!!!! I'm 15 years old and my adrenaline is through the roof right now. I love Godzilla's new nuclear pulse and Blue Atomic Radiation Lines on his body. Legendary Films really outdid themselves with this trailer.
That moment when Scar's tooth when through a building. Epic!!
I am so excited for this movie!!!
Crazzzyyyy😮
🔥🔥
Looks good
I'm gonna need an explanation as to why it looks like his thermonuclear form but blue.
Hmmm...😑
Looks like 💩
😂😂😂 last got such hype with endgame
It will be epic🔥
Omg an another godzilla
This movie is going to be awesome
YES!!!
at 0:30 Godzilla & Shimo Fighting at the Right Side ❤🔥
What a great time to be alive for Godzilla fans with all the content we've been getting
0:31 sec Shimu Face reveal 😂😂
oh my good godzilla is so greet¡¡¡
0:49 mothra is here!
2:32 is so goddam cool, excited for this movie
Godzillas not godzilla
this looks lit
Holy Cow, that was so epic! Now I’m really excited about seeing the movie!
I’m really excited for this!!!!
Previous movie Thor Axe,this time Thanos Gauntlet...wondering what next movie brings
楽しみだなぁ…！ これからは『怖いゴジラは日本、ワクワクするゴジラはアメリカ』って感じに分業していくといいかもしれない。
I need Mothra and King Ghidorah
Team Kong
0:30 MOTHRAAAAAAAA
Godzilla can now switch from ssj blue to ssj rose
Yes yes yes ......
Kongs getting a whole set of armor for Godzilla X Kong 3
GOATED
Holy fu..!
The boss doesn't look strong and big enough to face Kong and Godzilla 🤔
Oh god, King Kong got the Infinity Gauntlet.
BADASS
Two Godzilla???????
YES YES YES
From here watch in 0.25 2:13
King Kong lovers assemble here  👇🏻
GozzIron ❤😂
if i was 10 this would be cool
I’m so hype, this movie will be heat🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks like an animated show. Horrible effects.
I can't wait for the roars of Godzilla and Kong to break down the cinema speakers. I'm definitely going to watch this
So Kong is gonna be KING Kong
This looks so stupid and I honestly can't wait
Just WOW!
Bro  this is fire🗣️🔥
Is that King Kong with a metal arm joining forces with a pink Godzlilla to fight an Orangutan with a metal whip?? SIGN ME UP!!!
This is dumb af. SMH.
Shimo is in 0:30 slow the video  and look godzilla and shimo fighting ❤
This universe has gone full Transformers.
OMG 😱 what a trailer 🔥
AGHHH
SHIMU CONFIRMED??! ❄️
GODZILLA WILL ALWAYS BE THE KING!
I'm excited to see 😮
revived cinema
2014 - Let them fight 2019 - we join the fight 2021 - make em fight 2024 - make a tag team and let them fight.  (Mom im famous!)
The best thing about this film is knowing Toho Co will likely release yet another Godzilla masterpiece next year. I never wanted Godzilla and The Monster Avengers, but if it results in a sequel to Shin or Minus One, I’m all for it.
This is insane 😮
1:50 "Live Kong reaction"  That has to become a meme
BRAZIL AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Haven't seen a more enticing trailer like this in a while...
So when are we getting the King for Kong and getting electric power ups? I like the whole machine tools thing but unless you're gonna suit him up as Jet Jaguar Ironman hybrid, kindly back track and make him into a proper kaiju and not an overgrown gorilla like how Zilla was (overgrown iguana) in 1998 film
These are the kind of movies that deserve to be seen on the big screen. It looks totally epic.
What is that 0:48
It will be fun To watch Both legends in one frame again. Our battle will be Legendary❤
Godzilla Shockwaves was just insane.
W
literally watched the entire movie with this trailer
Hay un nuevo Kong bélico 👌🏻
This is gonna be an Epic Insane Awesome Theatre Experience 🔥🔥🔥
Es una bomba 💣
What did I just saw🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks so dumb
Mahn pure goosebumps 😨🥶🥶🥶🥶
My theory has now become shimo and scar want to become the new alpha for the fact Kong and Godzilla have cause to much harm
This WAS Epic!!!!!!!Cant wait!!!!
looks so insanely epic. goosebumps every time
BooOOOOooooOOOOOOooooom
THE TRUE AND ONLY KINGS ARE BAAAAAAAACK!!!!
This looks so promising
👍🏿💯
Cant wait to see this !
🔥💯
WB is doing good with Dune and these films. Why can't the DC films be this good?
damn this going to be crazy
What if Christ the Redeemer became the third member of the gang?
0:31 if you look to the right for a split second you will see Godzilla fighting shimo I’m not sure also a great trailer
BRO’ 🙌🏻
I love it!!!!! The Two Great Titans teaming up together!!!!!!
Why was mini Kong throwing a rock at Kong’s face? Maybe trying to wake Kong up? 😂😂😂
KONG NÃO PODE PARAR ISSO SOZINHO!!!
🤯
This is looking really good and like the build up of that new villain.
Meh. So many 🍆 riders.
What is that 😢
SPOILER-TRAILER! meh...
Ok WB but seriously release coyote vs acme
The Badass trailer 😮😮😮
Shimo at 30 sec
Goosebumps 🗿💥
This is epic 😮
Holly God-Zilla That was his nuclear pulse!!! This is gonna be epic!!!
Damn! Can’t wait to watch this all by myself. Godzilla and Kong more powerful than ever before
This is pure hype!!!
2:46 fine, I'll do it myself
This is what we fans wanted!!
just wow.. very excited..
Godzilla's screams sound like the "woooaahhh" from the WTFBoom" memez
I'M SO FREAKIN HYPE RN!!!!
This is what happens when you let Americans do what they want
Most hype trailer in cinema I ever watched
29 min ago and it has 200k, crazzy
0:31 Godzilla vs shimo🔥🔥🔥
This movie gonna be nothing but eye candy and I LOVE IT
1:26 looks like it could be Mothra's cocoon
Man 🔥🔥🔥
I am excited to see apes and lizard team up😂😅
GODZILLAAAAA!!!!
Can’t wait for the Cybernerds to react to this lol
They keep adding more unnecessary and kinda silly lore.
Highkey potential to be the best monsterverse film so far🔥
ez
godzilla is always king
Awesome,  can't wait.
Looks like a Transformers movie with Thanos.
At 2:50, Kong appears to have a metal tooth.  Looks like that tooth we see earlier is his.  Edit:  You can kind of see it in other shots, his tooth looks discolored compared to the rest.  Maybe he loses it earlier on and repays Skar in a later fight by knocking his out.
Did they really give Kong the power fist from fallout?
Damn this looks fun!!
SHIMU APPEAR!!! SHIMU APPEAR!!!
Take all my money 💰 🤑
Me waiting for Mothra, Rodan or Behemoth to come out 😿
Promete
Too bright. Too cartoonish. The monumentality of Godzilla and Kong is not felt.
Wow amazing 😮
I'M GONNA KONG IN MY PANTS!
Kong punching the building is insane. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I miss the times when Godzilla and Kong inspired horror and fear in the viewer (during the relaunch of the series). Now it's just a colorful jumble of pixels.
Let them FIGHT!
o shimu yatırır aşşa söylim
2:27 shimu atrás do scar king
This trailer has me all the more hyped for Godzilla and Kong to team up to save the world from Skar King. We even get a teaser for Shimu. I also hope that Mothra is in this movie too. I can't wait.
Never really been a big fan of the new Kong & Godzilla movies... But this looks pretty damn cool!
Me like when Big monkee and big dargon go punchy punchy
2:05 this seen giving me sort of Avengers Assemble vibes *Imagine Godzilla lagit says Monsterverse Assemble*☠️☠️
Seeing Godzilla and Kong teaming up to face their alternative evil selves is probably the most awesome film ever!!
Bhooot bura hai 😅
Is mothra in the movie
O MY KONG!
Who else is excited for the release?  👇
Funny how shimu was leaked through CoD
1!54 who is it?
Wow😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
2:33 The meme Wooooouuu yeah Baby
Oh man they still don't like each other 😢
Let’s GO KONG!!!
It's so beautiful.  🥲
Em MARÇO ESTAREI NO CINEMA
Love from India ♥️🇮🇳
espetacular!!
A Michael Bay movie.
How something can be so silly yet so badass is beyond me. Can’t wait!
Godzilla and Kong both upgraded to next level........ This movie going to be very crazy 🥵
kong has a hulk buster
This is becoming hilariously bad.
Wow! Suko the small Kong and our main man Kong found scar king’s castle with dozens of inslaved kong’s banging on the drums and scar and Kong fought, but Kong got his hand injured, and suddenly shimo shot her ice breath at Kong, and then Kong got a beast glove and fought Godzilla again, and later on he knocked scar’s tooth off his mouth, and suko threw a big rock on scar king’s face!
The best trailer. I love how Long and Gman still fight for round 4. And I love how we Saw Shimo. And Skar King being a badass.
The multiverse needs you once again 😇
🤩🤩🤩🤩🦍💥
Waiting for this masterpiece 😁😁
Goosebumps 😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Kaiju Fans are eating real good right now.
OMG This will be the movie of my life!
Incredible trailer. 🔥💪  Monsterverse is on fire..  Heroverse seems boring now.
That left hook from Kong to scar king  ☠️
Wowww nice 🔥🔥🔥
This look Amazing
KONG & GODZILLA ARE LIKE GOKU & BEGITA 😁
Godzilla 2014 is still the best one
У нас покажут в кинотеатрах или нет? 😢
This looks off the hook! Can't wsit!
So it shimo who messed up his arm not skar king
0:30 MOTHRA,SHIMU VS EVOLVED GODZILLA
Mexicans vs Asia 😂😂😂😂
peak cinema.
WE JUST GOT A GLIMPSE AT SHIMO AND HIS SIGNATURE FROSTBITE BLAST!!!!!! I CAN’T WAIT!!!!!
YESSS!!!! TRAILER 2!!
If you pause at the right time on 0:30 you can see kong fighting scarking and godzilla fighting shimo🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Daymmnn 😲 It will be interesting to see whom they will be fighting.
2:35  NUCLEAR PULSE!!!
This movie is gonna be LIT🔥🔥🔥
I’m about to cry this is so good
Si, pls!
#atAMC 🚀🔥
SHIMO!!!
I'm glad that Skar King isn't 190m tall like the leaks said and that Kong can have a fair fight with an equal
SO COOL I CANT WAIT!!!
There's so much information 🔥🔥🔥🔥
kong's mjölnir are broken like ragnarok 😅
This looks so much better than the first trailer.
In the beginning we can see kong vs skar.and godzilla vs shimo if you pause fast enough
cant wait to watch this legendary
Now I cannot wait for this!!
.... This looks like trash and if you're excited to see this, you're trash.
GODZILLA do mal Será??????????
I’m hyped up for this, can’t wait. Legendary has been killing it with the monster-verse Kailua royal rumble inbound
🦧vs🦍
Yay, another mid movie 😐🥱😴
March 29? Oh boy, it's close.
My boy Kong got that powerfist going on. I hope he put points in unarmed, not just melee
Looks like we almost saw the whole movie in 3 minutes ! Damnnn can't wait to see those 2 work with each other again !
Please be two good Godzilla movies in a row.
Legit stoked about this one!
oh my god this is going to be epic❤❤❤
oh very nice cant wait to see this new monster freeze everything
Let them fight
😱😱😱😱😱surtando
Beast af
Still no shimo
I’m liking Pinkzilla
If im being real tho the movements of the kaijus are unrealistic but still im hella ready for this movie!!!!
OMG, EPIC, JUST EPIC, 😮😮😮 Film of The Year, The MonsterVersre is LIT 💯💯💯💯💯
Not the girl seeing The Numbers like Mason was in Call of Duty Black Ops 💀 (I forgot her name) so far, this trailer is better but is spoiling a bit  I'm not sure if Kong lost a finger. Probably his pinky, I can't say for sure cause it happened so fast 💀  So far I thought Destroyah was gonna be added, but thank goodness no, Shimu Probably just has a flying form or something, could be another kaiju.  Kong fighting Scar reminded me a bit about the lion king but the fight in this city reminded me of "Pacific Rim Uprising" more specifically Guardian Bravos electric whip and Gipsy Vs. Obsidian Fury fight.  Godzilla learning to do the Atomic pulse had to be inspired from Heisei godzilla. It will probably be temporary in his blue electric form and not in his Pink one
It is cool and all but don't destroy our pyramids 😭
Shimo is very powerful
Skar king gave kong that work same with shimo
This is pathetic. This is not Godzilla, just a movie for idiots from the USA. As usual, Americans have to make films for American audiences, because we know that less educated idiots prefer big monsters without any plot.
0:30 mothra is back!!!!
i feel bad for this universe, probably this is going to be like pacific rim 2
How about Donkey Kong vs Kong?
This is gonna be EPIC🔥🔥 LONG LIVE THE MONSTERVERSE
Avengers assemble
Now all they have to do is the Epic Handshake from Predator
This movie is going to be epic.
More shimo plz 😭
RAWR
Epic! Can’t wait to see the movie!
Trailer and seen 😍🥹
This looks better than I thought!
What? lol
Kiya faltu hai ye
Why Hollywood fiction movie trailers have same bgm😂
This looks f*cking stupid.
Looks like Kong's weapon gets destroyed after Shimu's Frost breath
Im exciting for the movie but this trailer was kinda lame tbh
Cool trailer we could see that Godzilla still actually had the ability to do his thermonuclear pulse and it seems the reason Kong wears an infinity gauntlet is because Shimo burn his right arm and destroy his axe. Damn I just can't wait to find out who's gonna have the finishing blow on Shimo. Better no human supp like last time on mecha goji. I just wanna see a pure kaiju brawl.
Epic as always
This is the end game!
So thats what Shimo looks like
Big monke fight big monke, big lizard fight big lizard… me human, happy
Can't wait 🔥
We want that Shimo reveal, one frame wasn’t enough 😩
Best valentine's couple award 2024 kong & Godzilla
Dude godzilla is fighting shimu if you stop it at the right time 0:30
Shimo🗿
Team Kong forever ✊✊
Brrrooooooo..... Now this is a Monsterverse trailer I wanted. Can't wait to see it
Ale jestem podekscytowany czekam na to aaaaaa
I cannot wait this looks like such a ride🙌
gonna be wack and forgettable 🤪
The hype is back. Here we gooooo.
I'm so excited for this movie!
This looks REALLY BAD.
As always it was killer❤🎉🎉
HOLY LORDDD
Best 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Holy...cow, this MUST be seen in IMAX, along with a big popcorn bucket, a large soda and a big movie poster 🦍🐊🦧
Truly Epic! I need to watch this on cinemas right now.
Amazing, Marvellous
Omg !!!
WHERE IS SHIMOOOOOOOO?????
Did... did the trailer start with the Among Us sound effect?
Wow ,  just wow this gonna be epic 😍 Who else is excited for this movie..? 🙂
Best trailer I have ever seen for a movie in years, this movie looks more than incredible.
dont think it can beat godzilla minus one but looks pretty cool
Please don't like this comment
Hoping Gamera is in the post credit scene
Here we go 🔥
SHIMO
I'm gonna see it regardless, but I do feel like this trailer is showing a bit too much.
This movie is definitely spectacle over  substance. Godzilla Minus One is the template this is a pale American version that will pale in comparison.
god this movie is gonna be so dumb and i am somehow still here for it
Haa Hooo Thalaivareee 🥶🥵🥶🥵🥶🥵🥶🥵🥶🥵
NGL I'm pumped AF for this !
This movie comes out a day after my birthday, and I took off the 27-29. So I'll definitely be seeing this movie.
The movie is gonna be 2 hours of dialog and 30 minutes of action and 5 minute epic fight lol
What a masterpiece
ill be honest i tried really hard to not like this but i think i love it
Epic ✌️✌️
HYPEDDD
Pause at 0:31😯😯😯🔥🔥
Shimu is coming
This will be the best buddy cop movie ever made.
1:44 Man, this Skar King dude means business.
Kong PUNCH THE BLACK OUT OF SCAR KING LOL
Godzilla is becoming more intensive...
I'm here we 🎉
"In Godzilla and Kong I TRUST". I'm ready for this one.
Can’t wait for march 29
My God........ Zilla
this is gonna be a badass movie
*council of Kong*
Is this multiverse? 😂
One of the best trailer of Warner Bros pictures it's going to be awesome can't wait to watch !
It has begun 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I WASS RIGHTTTTTTTTTTTTT SHEMUUUUU WOOOOO CANT JUST SIMPLY WAIT FOR 29TH MARCH!!
This is insane😱
About time.
The are still not showing the other kaiju.....I really can't wait to see the actual scale of it on screen.
Awesome
Holy fack ...march 29 come fast
That is how you do a kaiju movie.
just cant stop waiting for this!
Godzilla isn't running fast enough
Godzilla and Kong will live through the motto of on site. Anytime anyplace
Why this is giving off Barbie vibes💀💀💀
the goosebumps goin crazy
I see godzilla using the thermo pulse but blue, Mothra and godzilla in deaf girls ear, multiple godzillas or titans, (ice, pink, then blue godzilla)
CGI  sooooooooooooooooooo baaaaaaaaaad
I'm in time
I would love for Mothra to be in this but it isn’t revealed until the movie is released ❤
w
Tahalka macha dega india me ye film...... Yaar trailor se hi kya goosebum aa rhe h
Can't wait❤❤❤❤
This 2:31 scene is osm Godzilla 🎉
tHAT WAS AWSM
Godzilla is going to be the best version in this movie.🍿
2:33 - Oh, it's like that meme ahaha So cute
Shimo at 0:31 and 2:13
This is an amazing birthday gift!
Епичненько
Revivió el monsterverse
they'll write fan fiction about anything these days
Sick!
Ooft
Skar King looks a lot smaller than Kong. I thought he’d be the same size more so.
espectacular¡¡¡¡¡
FUN
Atomic pulse returns
Wouldn’t be surprised if everyone had it flipped and shimu is the one controlling scar king
Inmangine the after credits of this movie is king ghidorah coming back with a vengeance.
Minus one 0/10  Godzilla X Kong 10000000000000
Godzilla & Kong . What a bang for 2024
Absolutely insane 😍 😳 😭😭
Lame
Cool
Finally, A Worthy Opponent. Their Battles Will Be Legendary 🔥
Not showing anything but shimo eyes is perfect
This movie 🎥 is bout to be stupid crazy 😜
My most anticipated film of the year
At first I wasn’t even interested in this movie but after seeing this. I just might watch it. As long as there’s lots of monster fights in it
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
i know this sounds stupid but it felt like there was a second godzilla a blue one
Just one word : EPIC
Interesting fact : Godzillas glowing indicates his power levels and this glow means he is in his strongest form so far
Pink Godzilla is one of the hardest things ever
OMG
This trailer just confirmed that ssj rosé Godzilla is now my favourite version of Godzilla
Monsters to the RESCUE!!!! Damn loved the trailer
monkey
WHY IS EVERYTHING SO BRIGHT
Seems like kong only lost cuz he got jumped🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️and why tf Godzilla shooting at king
Box office 👎
LETS GOOO
My most anticipated film of the year
Say what u want about this movie. I'm going to watch this and nothing can stop me!
Kong fans........
So this is a 2v2 of monkey and lizard vs monkey and lizard lmao
Lankey kong got an upgrade
HES BLUEEEE
Is epic 😮
Kong Team!! Assemble Here ✊
New Godzilla millenium
I CANT WAIT
TIME FOR CARNAGE
All these comments sounds like a bunch of bots
yes yes yes yes. did you notice that this year movies are better then 2023   😂
YESSSS
Thats what  we are all waiting for..epic
Kong really gave a Mike Tyson punch to Scar king 😂
WOWWWWW
Scar King a lanky boy
YEAH BIG MONNER
THIS IS GONNA BE FIREEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can wait to see teamwork against Skar King and it's going tobe WILD
Haven't been this excited for a movie in years ....... Epic
Why are they afraid to show Shimo
Scar King:Shimo : : Godzilla:Kong 😮😮😮❤
You could see Godzilla spearing. Shimo in the trailer when you freeze frame it. In the beginning of  the trailer, when they show Far wide shot. of the city.
The Trailer was Horrible Right now ❤😱😱🤯🔥
This trailer is more   good than the Minus one
This is Epic brooo👌👌👌
It’s sad to see that Millie isn’t in this trailer
I only want a total of 10 min with humans that’s it rest Kong and Zilla
I wanna see skar king beating Godzilla 😭
HYPEE ASFF
Damn destruction damn
i'm starting to think we might get a tiny bit too far about this franchise.  I mean, kong with a weapon is already out of the character. But now him having a war against a whole tribe of giant monkeys... that is just out of what he's suppose to be.  For godzilla, the one of 2014 was perfect because it gives the idea of a gigantic monster that fight over other monsters. And now, he's just a giant humanoid lizard who breath fire.
Let,s go!!
This is going to be epic can't wait.
Nice how shimo shoots out ice from its mouth cool
Thanks Warner Bros....
2:39 i did not know that the mini kong was so brace.
All I mould react with was wait what! Really? Wow
Godzilla and kong will be next level than before.
Pause 0:31 Godzilla and shimo fighting 😎😎😪
saldra shimo
Alright Alright

That haymaker Kong gave Skar King was vengeful after his arm injury💀
Godzilla and Kong, that's right dynamic duo, baby! This movie boutta be PEAK!!!!!! I CAN'T WAIT!!!!
WORDS CAN NOT EXPLAIN HOW OVERLY EXCITED I AM!!!!!!!
Might be better than 1st part
anybody notice Kong could barely hold shimo's blast?!?!?!?!? SO HYPED
the CGI ........
Did they show the whole movie?
Boy this is gonna be fun!
RIP to all those milliions and millions of  innocent poor ppl who died just bcoz two monkeys and a lizard were fighting
lol all of these comments sound so fake. Paid people to leave good comments on their trailer 😂
Monsterverse have gone to an ultimate level
Kong: "And I thought the other Godzilla was cold...."
Stupid af.  Stick to minus one
Aww, at the end they roar together because they're equals. Thats kinda cute.
This looks like a mess. It’s not for me.
BEST MOVIE AND TRAILER OF 2024 RAHHHHHHHH 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Deadpool: Big CGI fight coming up
holyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Esperemos no sea como la otra 🙄 15 minutos de Godzilla y el simio y el resto de una historia inútil de la muda que sobra y los demás y ojalá no salga la sobrevalorada de Millie Brown
I need less humans and more titans
YOOOOO THIS IS GONNA BE SICKKKKK ESPECIALLY DURING RAMADAN

Wow, that scene where Kong knocks Skar King's tooth out of his socket!
Those people who were criticising the CGI after watching trailer 1 when there was room for the CGI improvement, their mouth got now shut.
"Now I've seen everything" Have you seen a man eat his own head?
Argh great to see this part
This is already more chaotic than any other monsterverse movies so far
We in for a treat monster fanboys and girls! Leggo!!!
2:34 oh Godzilla finally using nuclear pulse like heisei Godzilla
Oh man that baby kong looks dreadful
ANY MOVIE THAT SHOWS OFF CG IN DAYLIGHT IS A GREAT MOVIE 🎉❤

I love how no-one is talking aht yodzilla being thermo nuclear but blue????
Hope they don't focus too much on the poorly written human characters
So much Phenomenal Epicness in this trailer! I'm Super Hyped to see Godzilla and Kong fight Skar King and Shimo as well as exploring the Hollow Earth & the titans there and so much more. Long Live The Monsterverse, March 29th Here We Come!
Shimo is extremely powerful than we thought 😮
This is make me as a mission,i seeing while video,i shake &got goosebumps 😮

Cant wait to see more of Shimo.
YAAAAS!!! NOTE: i thought that was transformers from the beginning! cause of the hand! who was tricked XD

Excited
😲
Top notch VFX hats off to the VFX and CGI artist 👌💯
Hype for the reason ❤🎉
So its endgame now Whatever it takes
Was that possibly another...Zilla of some sort?? Or? Cause whatever it was, it seem to have put Kong in some fear
Look at 0:30, you’ll see a specific Titan reflected in Jia’s eye.
I’m there day one
Graphics looks like a game

GODZILLA YUVASENAA

Finally godzilla uses the plasma attack, this is gonna be epic
you can see shimo in two shots here 0:30 and here 2:11 you will have slow down the video to clearly see her.0:27 here's mothra inreflection of jias eyes you will have slow down the video and rewind it three to four times to clearly see her.
I saw Shimo
Ain't know way they gave Kong a Iron Man Suit 😂
Right off the hop, i thought a Transformer was coming out of the ground at the pyramid.
I think I'm going to cry.
I'm so down for this showdown.
Where’s shimo
I don't want to sound like a hater but I really do not like pink atomic breath on Godzilla, I like the overall design I just want the the breath to change back to blue
1:52 Brudda is appalled Jawdropped and most importantly flabbergasted
Shimo's eyes wow! Incredible insanely powerful! Scar king so fast! Kong's punches and Godzilla getting mad 😡😤 What am I seeing! 😮Can't wait!!! ✊👊

2:32 Atomic Pulse or Alpha Roar?  OHHHH I WANNA KNOW SO BADLY!!!!!!
I AM Waiting ..
LETS GO
The latest Godzilla video game looks brilliant😂
Why is that views on every trailer coming out these days are looking less to my eyes after the bar GTA VI trailer set for views under hours
in human terms its michelle yeoh and helen mirren saving the world together
They have to make darker than brighter because it look like video game rather than movie. An best example is Godzilla king of monsters.😢
DEADPOOL 3 & GXK WHAT AN YEAR 2024 🔥⚡❄️
It's shimmo!!!!!!
HOLY F*CK,,,,,THIS EASY FROM SHIMO 👁️‍🗨️🥶
0:30 Why were there two more Godzillas?
Finally!!!!!
Daaaaaammmmmnnnnnnn🔥💪🏻

Godzilla x kong the new empire finna be lit 🔥
This looks terrible enough to be kind of fun.
Planet of the Apes 0.5 🦍🦍🙊🙊🙉🙉🙈🙈🦍🦍
Godzilla scream sounds like penguinz0
This duo is the best in the monsters verse ever 🫶🫶🫶🫶
THIS TRAILER IS PURE HYPE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They’re finally using Godzilla’s 2nd Iconic move his Nuclear Pulse
It does look very good, but I still want Coyote VS Acme.
No muestran nada de mothra, enserio??😑
I legit woke up in the middle of the night and remembered that trailer 2 was supposed to come out so i checked it and it said 17 minutes ago
All this movie needs are the Transformers and then BOOM we have a real movie on our hands.
1 MONTH ONLY!!!!!!!!! I DIDNT THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS EARLY IM SO HYPED!!!
The fact that these two will probably become boys after this makes me happy 2:53
At the end of this movie we will finally know who is the real king 👑
Naahhhhhhh Kongggg❤❤❤❤❤
😮😮😮😮😮😮😢
Godzilla 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shimo 😮
They reused the same stuff
LETSSS GOOO!!!
I love the change from VS to X  this is the tale of them turning from fighting each other to becoming bros
While I love the trailer I really wish this was the first we saw of Shimo. Like this is such a more badass way to tease her then the Playmates toys.
is epic!!
THIS IS BOUTTA BE FIREE YOO
Crazy🫀🫀
Godzilla with the lightning pulse looks insane
LET'S GOOOOO
this is epic!
Big MONKE
1:52 did Y’all see Kongs Face… if Shimo scares Kong… then he must be a big threat.
Can. Not. Wait!!!!
So they confirmed Shimu
Kong & Godzilla are like Falcon & Winter Soldier,  They are not good friend, But they can work together.
God damn ! ... 👀💀
Can't believe it's been 3 years since Godzilla vs Kong.

Before Scar King, there was Kong vs Godzilla.
This movie is gonna be epic, and everyone knows it!
Wow...!
🗣️🗣️ we’ve cooked
Amazing trailer 👌 😍
I guess the Great Apes were compelled to protect these miniature scrawny, hairless version of themselves
This is goin to make a new empire ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
0:29 you can see Godzilla and shimo fighting
0:31 Godzilla vs Shimo🥹😵🙀
Why when godzilla screams it sounds like moistcritical meme?
❤❤
Meu deusssssssssss! Eu tô arrepiadoooooooo! Vemmmmmmmmmn

Shimu💀
Can't believe the Monarch had reached a whole new level of developing technology for Kong, the Gauntlet.
This is gonna be epic 🔥🤞
What is that ?? 1:54 ????
What a trailer❤❤❤❤
I have loved Godzilla for 50 years, and loved these US movies as well, but this looks like they're jumping all the sharks the ocean has to offer 🙄🙄🙄🙄
After watching Godzilla Minus One this trailer doesn't impress me much.
two kong and two godzilla seems interesting
Im speachless they COOKED with this
I paused my breathing for last 3 minutes... woo!! Damn Man!
Imagine in the post credit scene we see people building mecha king ghidora that will be so cool
GODZILLA JUST WENT THERMO BY HIMSELF
Holy... I love MonsterVerse and this will be the best battle. I can not wait to see
Man like Optimus Kong
Shimu 🤍💥
zero goosebumb, what happenend to movie like godzilla 2014 and king of monster
What a time to be a Godzilla fan! So hyped!
This looks absolutely ridiculous. Bring on the insanity. Can not wait to see this. Love this franchise. Long live the Monsterverse
This trailer has me confused at some points like does he stay in his evolved form? Or is he back in blue? This story just seems all over the place  Good action tho can't wait to see it
This looks cringe af but I’m still gonna watch it.
They showed everything in the trailer
Where’s the homie Anguirus
cant wait its gonna be insane fr this movie will be amazing !!!!!
Titan shimu confirm ❤❤❤❤❤❤
King Louie’s ancient ancestor looking HUMONGOUS
Skar King is gonna be Kong's Ghidorah
IS KONG DEAD IN THE HOLLOW EARTH
iowiouwiouw! s2
So theyre bringing some transformers element into it
Godzilla God Of Monsters
Electric godzilla?
Holy Shut Damn This Is Incredible Trailer 🔥💥🥵
I CANT WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT!!
This looks amazing 😍
Guess shimo is hidden
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Kong bows to no one 😮
This is going to be one of the most titanic monsterverse battles yet🔥! And judging by Kongs face at 1:51, the new ice titan will be as formidable as Ghidorah himself.
PEAK FICTION
We need kong...the world needs him.
ok
Amazing! Long live the KINGS!
Yeah… i dont care what people saying.. this looks 🔥🔥🔥 im just hoping they lay off the jokes and bring back the vibes that the first two movies had
LETS GOO! ITS DEMON TIME FR!
YESSS!
*YESSSSSSSSS*
Shimo on the dark blasting out an Ice Beam. I appreciate them being secretive still, but letting those who’ve known about the leaks this whole time, see a little sneaky peak💪🏼
We full Showa era with this one boys.
Well... I just watched the entire movie so, I don't need to go to theater...
Sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’ll take a bad human story with a lot of monster action. Over a good human story but making the tittle character a side character cameo
Brutal, Epic, Monumental, and Beautiful
Godzilla and Kong working together. This movie is going to be AWESOME!!!
Lets gooooo
I CANT WAIT!!!!
😫
Watched 4 times not even a single minute is going to be bore in the film the most epic film from all of the monsterverse films guaranteed really nice
We need Kong. The world needs him.
Ok. now this is epic
It would be cool if they changed the logo. Like, rotating the X so it would look like Godzilla + Kong, or something. Or callinh Godzilla & Kong. Doesn't have the same ring as "X" or "VS" but they are working together.
Hype Hype!
Long live the kings
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🎉🎉
This looks awesome
Cannot wait for this. That punch from Kong at 2:26-2:28 is incredible.  Cannot wait to see him and Godzilla fighting Scar King and even against him 1 v 1 at Hollow Earth.
This will be epic
che
If canadian lad made vids of monsterverse movies in 0.25x speed , this would be his longest vid for sure
NEW
This is goin to make a new empire ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
This is called real mad max
Can never get enough of Godzilla 🔥
This looks better than I first anticipated 🎉
PHENOMENAL TRAILER 🦍 🦖
I never thought Godzilla would team up with King Kong
Skar King is skinny. 😂😂
Orange Cat is > Godzilla or Kong.
They missed an opportunity to show Doug in the trailer 💔
I have a doubt. Is Skar King controlling Godzilla?
Its anout to get amazing
This will be the greatest monsterverse film
Yea this is gonna blow minus one out the water no pun intended
LET'S GO! Look at godzilla run lol
mass ❤‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m quite glad this franchise is still going, I wasn’t sure if it was very profitable.
I think Godzilla might have had some trauma seeing Kong with a mechanical arm upgrade…Since Mechagodzilla most definitely haunts Godzilla’s nightmares somewhat. I think Godzilla would’ve been more enraged than ever seeing that. I could be wrong but it’s a possibility.
Seen all the best bits, thanks for saving me the ticket price. 😂
i want to love this but man i am just so burnt out by people on "green screen reacting to giant stuff" genre. in an age where we can create any visual we can imagine, why isn't any of it compelling?
Day fcking one
GODZILLA AND KONG FANS WE EATING GOOD THIS YEAR‼️‼️
😊😊😊😊😊 that's a good movie at all
THAT WAS EPIC!!!

Skar King: The Beast With 2 Backs
2:26 DAMM THAT PUNCH DAWG
Corny it's like a Disney flick now
2:32 Damn that roar sounds like a final F U
Can't wait to see this 🔥
Glad they didn’t show too much of Shimo yet. Gonna be badass to see him in theaters
2:34 MOTHRA?
Going To Theatre for sure 🤟🏼🔥⚔️🤩
plz let Godzilla defeat kong , atleast in this... plz respect the logic of their difference between sizes and powers.
Bro when king punched skar king that was probably the meatest punch in history
i hate the pink, i hate it. Ill watch this for free, not in the movies.
this looks soo good
JESUS CRISTO
Here We Go Trailer Two Awesome 💯💯💯❤❤❤
This coming out my birthday weekend and I couldn’t be more excited.
Shimu is pretty strong that even frozen king gihdorah
My heart... is racing.
Awesome 👏 👏👏👏😎
THIS TRAILER IS FIRE❤ CAN'T WAIT TO EXPERIENCE THIS MASTERPIECE
I love this trailer. Not only do we see that both Shimo and Skar may team up against the kings, but Kong even knocked out one of Skar's teeth. IT'S ABOUT TO GET WILD.
ostia
Thank you warner brothers, I may not have a valentines but I now have Godzilla x Kong trailer 2

Bro in next movie kong will have the wole iron Man suit
Godzilla x Kong gonna Blast in theatre 💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥
Wow 😲😲🔥🔥
Victory screeeeech: ahlahlahlahlahlahlahaaaa😂
looks bad
The part where Kong fought Skar King was epic. In first round Skar King damages Kongs arm with his Whiplash. But then Kong knocks his tooth out in the second round.
HOLY THIS MOVIE IS HYPE ASF
Kong got the infinity gauntlet and Godzilla achieved super saiyan rose. this is gonna be epic
Bro Shimo can fly , I didn't see that one cummung
Legendary's answer to anguirus I see.
🔥 Godzilla x Kong VS Skar King x Shimo ❄️
I'm so excited for y'all to see my preformence in the movie
This is gonna be one good year for monsterverse fans
Well, from what I've seen in this new trailer, it looks like Lain's movie leaks have been largely accurate, at least for the final battle in Rio de Janeiro. 😉
This is epic 💥💥💥💥💥💥....omg.....such a most adventurous movie ever gone bee....Kong & Godzilla.....
Trash
No one gonna mention godzilla scream sounds like Moist Critikal's?
are we gonna get a  pay off for the legacy of monsters or was that just to fill in the blank.
The tease to Shimo was perfect and Goji,Kong and Skar look dope.
Kong punched one of scar king’s teeth out
Theres a suprise at 0:30/0:31 just keep looking at the top right corner
Evolved godzilla looks more evil then Last time and with his now from  and of course his 2019 been more cooler
I love this series ❤
I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
I like the part where Kong was like  “And I am Monke” *snaps fingers and saves the universe*  Can’t wait to see this movie 😂
😮😍😍😍
0:31 BIGGEST FIGHT EVER
Everyone who is so god DAM excited for the movie🦍🦧🦖(couldn’t find a emoji for Shimo) 👇
Esto va ser épico ❤❤❤
Gommala thooki soruvanum gommala
Look f###en awsome ❤❤❤
Best freaking Trailer I ever seen
K, now THIS is hype.
Kong with power  fist seems like a mortal combat character
cool, seen the whole movie now
This movie is soo good
I can't wait to see these two get it on, like in bed...you know. Kong and Zilla-boi bump uglies....(f*ck)...I CAN"T WAIT!
2024 is awesome year for movies
Now we need a trailer 3
Realese Coyote vs Acme WB!!
The Hype is getting bigger than ever
Masterpiece!
Yall pretty much showed us the entire movie. Can you stop doing that!
I think one more Godzilla arrives
This movie is looking to be a blockbuster 🤯🤯
The king of the monsters will regain forever
Long live the king 🦍
Ok... I'm more hyped now than with the first trailer 😳
Godzilla looks like hes going to be kicking scars butt
If you look very closely at 0:30 when all the flashes happen you can kinda see Godzilla fighting Shimo
This is peak cinema🤯🤯
Awesome
Aw man, we wanted to see Shumi’s appearance in the trailer
Scar king got rocked😂
I loved it when the Skar King said “I am going to build The New Empire!” and then he Newed all over the screen
At 2:12, Shimo is altering the Earth's environment to suit his preferences, similar to what Ghidorah nearly accomplished!
possibly the most epic movie in the mosterverse
it's gone be a great future
My god-zilla! This is going to be the Godzilla movie of the century! I love Shimo's reveal in Skar King's kingdom, and how it fights OMG, you can now rephrase it to: ''We need Godzilla, the world needs him, to stop what's coming..''
So is shimo a weapon of the Scar King
NOO WAY KONG JUST GOT A HUGE SCTACH IN HIS ARM POOR HIM
What a movie 🔥
Full trailer already released. Multiple versions of godzilla huh, now I get it. Also, it looks like he knew that Shimo was coming so he migrated and evolved on his own to prepare for shimo? Don't see any hints about them meeting pre evolution. Then again, it's just a trailer. This is too good. Hoping it lives up to the hype🔥
0:31 godzilla vs shimu and kong vs scar king
YOOO!!
Nuclear pulse Letts gooooo finally !!!
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST MOVIE FOR 2024
かっこいい！！
KING KONG❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Stunning 🔥🔥🔥
Finally my god this is epic 🔥
WERE TF IS SHIMO

THIS TRAILER WAS AMAZING!!
This is gonna be by far the best Monsterverse movie ever made! Hands down the best! The first encounter of Skar King, Shimo and Kong says it all. 😮‍💨
This is so ridiculous in many ways and i can't wait for it 😅
1:51 Kong's fear was very expressive.
This time looks like Adam WIngard has made a great job, not like G vs K.
Bring out their ultimate roar!!!
Ae beta far delas ! Maja ajai. Ekarake hall mein dekhe ke pari.
Man why you guys revealed shimu in the trailer, should've let it be a surprise 😭😭
huge ahh gorilla lizard dragon and Orangutan going brrrrrr
This looks terrible! Do better WB! Wrecking this franchise like you did DC!
Uuuuuh yessssssw
2:27 🔥
Deadpool 3, Kingdom of the Planet, Godzilla x Kong. I love this year...
2:48 look at how long scar king hands are 😬😬
Oooo yeah!!!!!! Let's gooooo
This movie is going to be incredible and I can’t wait, I can only imagine how crazy it’s gonna be when the final few MV films come out and they have space Godzilla, Destroyah or even Bagan pull up.
APE TITAN? Wtf
The Ice thing is Shimo guys, theorized to have put Gidora in that wall of ice
Scar king can't win 1 v 1 against kong....so he had to call shimo😂
This movie and the new Deadpool are gonna make SO much money ❤️
Now that's a trailer
OMGGGGGG YESSSSS
Kong Going to End
0:31 in this scene we can see kong vs scar and godzilla vs shimu fighting in the same city

Seemo Godzilla it's 🧊
Goosebumps. All i can say is Goosebumps
I wish the characters from Godzilla 2 weren't in this one because they did nothing in the last one nor in 2 so I've not got much hope for them here either.
Damn they bout showed the whole damn movie
2:32 this scene is osm Godzilla 🎉
I’m here for it!!!
Goosebumps 😈
Yes YEA YES MORE
Dies ist ein epischer Film aus dem Jahr 2024, vergeben Sie Dune 2
Big monkey!
Welp we finally got to see SHIMO
LETS GO
Love the action.. bt this trailer revealed too much. Looks like there will be nothing new to see in the theatres.
nice
So this is an Optimus Primal origin story?
That punch that made Skar lose a tooth was personal af
Best CGI ,VFX era back finally ❤
Gamera when
YES!!!!!!
Why do I feel like Godzilla and shimo will hook up and that’s gonna set up son of Godzilla?
This movie is going to be the best movie of all time!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🦖🦍🦧
I can’t wait for this film
1:51 SHIMO IS HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I..I have no words to describe how hyped I am for this movie. The action, the insane fight scenes, Godzilla's lighting abilities, Kong's beast glove...I gotta see this in IMAX!

Godzilla é mais forte que o Shimo, ninguem tanka ele mais no Monsterverse. Só se trouxerem o Destroya
OMG SHIMU IS IN THIS MOVIE???
Loved it
Naw this looks dumb fire!!!! 😅 lol way better than GvK   KOTM is still my favorite of the series tho
Kong glove does have electrical powers, Kong (gorillas) are able to show and process emotions like humans and it was so evident in this trailer, the fear, the compassion , the hate and the anger... Can't wait for the movie..........
Oooh god godzilla got thermonuclear but in it blue     😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is epic!
Shimu confirmed and Scar King looking so sick! This 2v2 is gonna go so crazy! 🔥🔥🔥

Godzilla is the best
Pass.
Oh yeah, the Primal Rage prequel looking lit
Is it just me or is Godzilla copying the dragon ball z method of transformations?
A far better trailer than the last one!
🔥🔥🔥
Who needs valentines day when you got godzilla and kong
The moment where Kong knocks out Scar's tooth is simply the BEST MOMENT OF THE ENTIRE TRAILER.

WB was like F the superbowl, "I'll do it myself"
This looooookkkksss sooo dope, y'all have really outdone yourselves
Scar king is actually beast Titan from AOT🎉

Kong knocking Scar King's tooth out tells me that this movie's gonna be peak.

PEAK KAIJU ACTION
Mothra Will Return like the toys with phosfora
Scar king is actually beast Titan from AOT🎉
YA LONG LIVE KING KONG
1:45 did he just  scratch his arm a little bit if tell me  that doesn’t look like a small scratch  oh shoot this is gonna be one of the toughest fight they will have even in the monster verse
Godzilla ! Kong ! We need you ! The world 🌎 needs you ! ❤
Here comes the "Shimo"
🔥⛽️
OH… MY… GOD!!! This will be the best movie of the year!
Gotdamn Ive never been this hyped about a movie for a min now Let’s do this
ITS JUST GREAT HOW GODZILLA CAN NOW DO AN ATOMIC PULSE !1!1!1!   W GXK
The little sound effects they keep using sound like Patrick Star screaming.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥amazing.
0:31 Godzilla vs Shimu if you watch at 0.25 speed looks badass
To offer us this filthy thing after this jewel that is Godzilla Minus One... You have to dare!
0:30 SHIMO!!!
Is it just me or that flash in the eyes in the head of Mothra?! 0:30
There can't be two alpha titan!
Godzilla: For thousands of years I lay dormant who has disturbed my- Kong: Hey best buddy Godzilla: Oh it’s you
Godzilla and Kong are the goat
looks like cartoon
30 Seconds u See the BRawl that we want !"!!! Godzilla and KOng vs Shimo and Scar King !"!!!
Mothra is Returning
Dont kill Kong in the movie
What a time to be alive
0:31 You guys can see there's shimo here fighting with Godzilla in one frame, it's really cool
It's amazing!
Am I the only one fatigued of these big budget CGI sludgefests? It’s literally the same as the last movie with a different villan. Terrible dialogue. Predictable plot. They turned Godzilla and Kong into overly intelligent action kung fu fighters. Just boring and lazy.
The G-Man is the GOAT!
This gonna be epic
Gonna wait for imdontai to react to this
Multiverse of Kongzilla❤❤😂
More MonsterVerse is never bad.
They totally pulled a Spider-man 'No Way Home' and had a giant ice blast coming from the sky when it was clearly supposed to be Shimo/Shimu  😊
It's like Cody and seth Rollins vs Rock and Roman Reigns 😅❤
NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE 2 GODZILLAS LIKE WTFFFFFFFFFFFF HYPEEEEE
Godzilla And Kong would dominate the Final Battle, hope for sure 🔥🙌
This movie is gonna be Legendary (pun intended)
0:30 there are two Godzilla like creatures in the shot that overlooks the city
Can't wait to relive the hype train again just like Godzilla VS Kong all over again. 🔥🔥🔥
Every person who want too see gxk👇
Fearsome Godzilla has evolved!
The hype is real
Godzillas electromagnetic pulse attack looks so damn good 🔥🔥🔥
Oh my goodness I can't wait for this movie
they are cooking these godzilla kong movies non stop :D
IM COMMING !
WE SHALL HAVE DESTRUCTION!!!
Kong is inevitable
2:27 SHIMO :D
Looks really fun as a Godzilla fan and it being my favorite piece of fiction I have to see this day one
They cooked 🔥
I can't wait to see Godzilla and Kong fighting Skar King and Shimo, this movie is going to be fire!
PEAKKKK ASFFFFGG
WOW!! CANT WAIT FOR THIS!!
They literally showed the whole movie 🙃
Stoked!!!! Thank You Warner Bros and Legendary extend the Monsterverse!!
Im goig to burst
The more I see the more silly it looks !! 😢
long live the king
We didn’t get much of Shimu in this trailer but what we did get implies that Shimu might be the most powerful titan to ever exist if both Godzilla and Kong are afraid of it. This is going to be awesome
Millennium power
It's worth looking forward to in 2024
omg
WHERES MY GIRL MOTHRA 😂
DAMNNNN THIS TRAILER IS BETTER THAN FIRST ONE DUDE
Oh my lord this may be the most excited I've ever been during a trailer
This is going to be the best Monsterverse movie  🔥🔥🔥 Can't wait!
send all that wasted money to war victims.
I'll be there no matter what
WOOOOO IM HYPED this is why I love the monsterverse just pure godzila and kong epicness🔥🔥🔥
I can’t believe we got our first glimpses of shimo ever since his leaks on toys and in other merch
Epic❤❤❤
THIS LOOKS AMAZING! HYPE!
solidddd
The world 🌎🌍🌎🌍🌎🌍 of good and bad collide
Skar King is the same size of Mecha Godzilla..
Those blue eyes of which Kong was afraid of 🥶
I can't wait for this fight 🔥
So Skar King actually did injures Kong's arm
Shimo Father of all Titans🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
1:52 oh Sugar Hot Ice Tea!
So after this movie is done with its theatrical run, can we get Minus One back?
This is going to be stupid in the most awesome way possible.
Yoooooooo
ok that's cartoon
Godzilla 💙🔥
Awesome
godzilla and shimu fighting in  0:31
THIS LOOKS INSANE!
Looks great! My only worry are the humans, I dont want them taking more screentime than kong and godzilla
yooo early
0:31 A full view of the duo fight,  godzilla looking a lot more pink like atomic godzilla but pink haha, maybe just a not finished CGI cause they look like  a kid draw  Despite that, now i have a question, is Godzilla loosing control again? Looks like he is gonna end mad after the fight when its new transformation finishes
So pumped!!! This looks like a fun time at the movies! Can't wait! 👏
abuudabililiisabadkitenholymollyfriedchienmilion
Team Kong 🇺🇾
Ithu thnn da padam.....
HERE WE GO!!!
Тут ще буде Шир
Motheras egg was shown that was totally her
Why Kong is wearing Thanos gauntlet?

Yessss lessss Goij baby🔥🔥🔥
This looks worse than King of Monsters 😭
Dude in some shots the scale is brought back making the monsters feel huge again
shimo 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
THIS SOO GOOD 🎉🎉
I just hope this franchise will never be ruined by any forced crossover
yo imagine being a gibbon or an iguana seeing this--so inspiring <3
WOW... This looks literally INSANE! March 29th can't come soon enough!
2:27-2:28 Dang, my boi Kong just knocked Scar King's tooth out, noice XD lol. 2:38 Go Suko! :D  Anyway, after watching this trailer and yet before I did that I finally got the 2 toys for this movie even tho' I thought about getting one more which is the Suko and Doug figures? I still can't wait to see this, and besides, like I said even if it ain't perfect? I'll still enjoy this movie either way since not only that I might have fun with this movie? but I think Suko might also be my favorite part about it that it makes me wish that in the future, a Suko and Doug cartoon would've been an actual awesome-dorable idea :)
Kong is legit personal to Skar when he punched his Face even until his tooth coming out lol 😂, Kong is different for sure 🔥  But yeah Godzilla Vs Shimo will also be legendary as well, seeing someone who is ancient to him will be interesting af, this is personal too for Godzilla to Face Shimo and face his Ancestor basically who's getting controlled, i think yeah Godzilla and Kong would saves Shimo if i see it, Godzilla will be dope as well ✨
Set playback speed to .25 and look at 0:30, Shimo is way bigger than i thought it'd be🫠
Can TOHO Godzilla pls show up and kill these two idiots
when do godzilla and kong make out and fall in love
Oh my god😳
A legendary battle or war is coming and two alphas one of nature the other of humanity will battle to the end until their newest threat is defeated
Kong usin that SNES power glove!!!!
The gauntlet is thrown
The Peak Empire
And now it gets silly. You've got Baby Kong, any chance of Godzooky?

🔥
When will the episode be shown?
Goosebumps 🥶🥶
Baap re ❤❤❤
WAS THAT SHIMO USING HIS ICE ATTACK ON KONG?! Anyway I think we can all agree that this movie gonna be a lot of fun. Doesn't need to be dark and gritty like minus one, end of the day we're here for Epic monster battle's and some juicy lore.
Pretty awesome trailer, much better than the previous one. My only question is wtf was that scream they kept using. Sounded like it was ripped straight from a meme comp 😂.
Yayyyy
LONG LIVE THE TWO POWERFUL KINGS!!!!
Yo this trailer fire 🔥 can’t wait for the movie
Who else can’t wait for the New Empire to drop?
People vote for Kong 👇
All Hail Kong
En efecto es cine 🚬
Damn thats fire🔥🔥
Music of the trailer is terrible
Kong with the Infinity Gauntlet 👀😎
Yea take my money already.
Guys Godzillas going blue thermonuclear
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 THEATRE WILL BLAST
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITED IVE BEEN FOR A MOVIE IN A LONG TIME!!!! THIS LOOKS SO ACTION PACKED!!! THIS FILM IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE!!!!
cant believe ppl are so excited (inc me)to see bit overgrown lizards and a monkies team up and fight each other 😂😂. Also, WB should put refferce points (like little human or trees etc) to show how big they are when those big monsters are running around or standing and also the psylogical impact and shock because of their size on human brains  (like godzilla minus one did)
Since when Godzilla has electric powers? Did I missed something?
People vote for godzilla 👇
Release #CoyoteVsACME
THIS WILL BE THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!. TEAM FOREVER 🦍
This Battle Will Be Legendary 🔥🔥🥵🥵
🔥🔥🔥🔥

WE'RE SAVING THE HOLLOW EARTH WITH THIS ONE!!!!
Me seeing this after the trailer was already leaked a couple minutes before:
Here comes daddy 😊
Movie of the year the new Empire
I love them all
While I’m excited for this film, I’d rather see some of the more classic Kaiju return, like Destroyah or perhaps even a Biollante. Or even bring in some more allies for Godzilla and Kong, such as Anguirus or a return for Rodan.  Also we need Mothra to return for a solo mothra film.
This looks so dumb... I love it
EPIC
Aaaa iam exciting from this
Once again Mother Earth calls for her guardians and they hold the fate of everyone on their planet
LONG LIVE THE KING!!!
This is gonna break the box office.... Man it's pure goosebumps.... Adam really created The MASTERPIECE 🔥🔥🔥🔥 long live the the king (Kong)🔥🔥
Releasing this trailer on Valentine’s Day was definitely a choice 😂
I got chills once kong used his axe on shimo  sheeshhh

Godzilla vs Shimo and Kong vs The Skar King this will epic
Gosh, I think the sky beam meme is more than what it might seem in a dream do you know what I mean Sean (gotya!)
No! I will not team up with him & No! I won't team up with him! You can't make us! Like, seriously have you seen the size of us! haha
My man shimu
Godzilla my guy kiyamon
Set the video speed to 0.25 and you can see Shimo and Godzilla wrestling
Looks great, but I really feel like King Ghidorah should have been a later antagonist for them to have to work together to bring down. I think he showed up and was subsequently defeated far too soon.
Shimo looming in the dark like "Who killed the dinosaurs!? THE ICE AGE!"  Let me know if you caught that reference, you degenerates
can you guys just make sure they still look like GIANT MONSTERS in the hollow earth ? but yea it's looking better than i thought!
And I thought Godzilla vs Kong was the best film in the MonsterVerse! I AM SO EXCITED!!! LET'S GOOOO!!!!
2:12 This scene also epiccc
Fire 🔥
Bro this is gonna be so gooooood!
🤩🤩🔥🔥
Full Paisa waool🔥
Absolutely Amazing
Let's goooooo🤩🤩💥💥💥💥💥

I have to be honest this looks amazing and epic movie will have all the action and fights , still hate the slim figure of Godzilla he looked better bulky
WTF was ein endgeiler Thrailer kann es kaum erwarten den zu sehen...weiß jemand zufällig ob der auch in 3D kommen soll❤❤❤❤
HOLY SHIMU THIS IS GONNA BE INSANE
we need a new mechagodzilla
I cant WAIT for this movie❤❤idc what anyone said about these films they're great
All those aboard the Hype Train!!!  👇

🔥🔥🔥
I’m excited
LFG! My wallet is ready to purchase an entire row at my local theater and I'm probably going to watch this as many times as I watched Godzilla Minus One
By far better than the first trailer
YESSSSSSS
0:31 there is shimo
IM SO HYPE
Peak cinema 🤩🤩💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m calling it Godzilla vs kong 2
Godzilla se ve genial y Kong también y los los demás también la mejor película
Godzilla. Then. Now. Forever. obviously AMS99W is in a great spot
🗣
Kong knocked Skar King's tooth out and sent him flying with a punch ( not with the B.E.A.S.T glove ) Let's freaking Gooooo!!!
RISE TOGETHER OR FALL ALONE
Dude i wanted to the new kaiju its only the eyes glow wheres is it im all in for this
0:31 is that Godzilla vs shimo and scar king?
LONG LIVE THE RULERS OF EARTH 👑👑
Just the MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!🐲🦍🦧
The Superman punch by Kong!
Holy s#it this looks incredible! That shot of Godzilla at the beginning going through the bridge was sick af! And finally a tease of Shimo!
I can't wait for this 💯🔥🔥🔥
One time arch enemies now must join forces to save both our world and theirs from something even worse… Makes me wonder how they will respond when Mecha King Gihdora rises
Kong seeing another hollow earth portal: ahh s*it here we go again
Maaaannn I used to be so hyped about these movies until they went full Marvel
[dies from peak fiction]
oh yeah a red velvet Godzilla
The fight win be in Rio- Brazil?
Pause at 0:31 you can see godzilla vs shimu
What they showed of shimo looked crazy. Also is that lightning godzilla
Epic Madness!!!!
Let's go baby
I really love how Kong just punched Skar King and knocked his tooth out...That was just legendary 😂
day one <3
THIS IS GOING TO BE PEAK
Godzilla fan 🔥🔥🔥
Is Mothra going to be in Godzilla x Kong?
This looks so epic. Please don’t be another heavily cut down film like so many films be these days especially from WB
Yo Godzilla had me terrified. I love what they are doing with him. It also shows the limitations of a giant monkey. Along with the fact that most of the trailer Kong looks weak.
Kong tem que usar seus poderes elétricos😢, por favor, não estragem meu menino
#TeamZILLA💙  Even though they're gonna work together.
Finally we can see godzilla's nuclear pulse in live action( the one which he used to kill MUTO PRIME).
Really cool omg
Let them fight.. TOGETHER!!!
Damn, Kong's an absolute beast! Can't wait to see him in action again!
Kola massuuu🔥💥
My body is ready and willing. Take me Kong and G man.
Marval ki ab fategi gand #GODKONG

Okay, they brought in mini Kong (son of Kong?); now for the NEXT one, they HAVE to bring in Godzilla's son, Minilla 💯‼️
Its obvious that Godzilla isn't at all happy seeing Kong again. Really hyped up to see their first encounter after GVK . Something or someone is gonna show up to stop these two Alphas from again throwing hands.

WOW  This made me so excited for the movie I CAN'T WAIT🔥
Kise skar king sukdi lagtaa hai😅😅😂👇👇

Potente la cosa
GODZILLA with the NUCLEAR PULSE. GODZILLA IS OP ASF. SKAR KING AND SHIMO DONE MESSED WITH THE WRONG TITAN TODAY! 💯
This is looking very intriguing so far, looks very promising but won't be as good as Godzilla Minus One, the humans were written better in that film than the american films, aside from the 2014 Godzilla, they at least tried in that movie
This is the one series where I don't even care if it's a bad movie, I just want to see big monsters.
Damn that looks awesome!
The look on Kong's face after seeing Shimo is chilling.      No pun intended.
One of my favourite movie
