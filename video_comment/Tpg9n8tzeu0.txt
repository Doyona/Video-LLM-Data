King vs minion which is better?
Woahhh
I opened the game after a year…so many new things …some gud like no time to train…but what is the point of 5 heroes if u cannot use them..plus hero equipment is too much for a fun player….slowly they have over complicated the game…miss the old days..when th10 was max
I’m glad that the hero hall starts at max level to your town hall and minion Prince starts  with the highest level by the previous town hall
I would like to see a Hero Builder only for upgrading heroes but you can also use normal builders for it
if the heroes upgrade doesnt require any builder, that will be the biggest help for maxing the base faster 😂
Where am I supposed to use DE? After just upgrading TH? One time building would have been better. I don't see any reason to open the game if I can't even use the resources. This was a bad move
New metal paints and Dark Orb is best for minion prince otherwise you should use Dark orb and hench puppet  in low town hall level
So if current date feb 20 2025 will I get the minion prince level 70 when I unlock it ?  About to be level 8 town hall
if i upgrade the hero is still the hero available to use or not? if not ill pass
been playing this game for about 14 years man i rm when it was bk and aq first came and it was the coolest thing every grinding to get ur bk leveled up to get the ability  getting hype when u found a dead base so fun man just a dif area of mobile gaming so ducking good
I have upgraded the hero 5 times. Haven’t gotten any new heroes.
The hero hall getting progressively bigger and bigger in each picture gave me a good laugh 🤣
This thing looks just like the devil.
They should have made the hero hall like the lab so that you can use the hero while it is upgrading, especially because hero equipment made heros less worthwhile to upgrade
Haven't used it once yet since I've had him upgrading back to back since the update
How they make the Minion Prince look like a black dude. The type that steals your wallet and helps you look for it 😂😂
Lavaloon attacks are gonna be significatly harder. Im goning back to edrag spam
Bro help me, my town hall level 11 but i could not find my minion prince banner!
i just came back to clash of clans yesterday i was town hall 9 and after i attacked my base i was so confused with all the new stuff
Now COC turning Pay to Win 💩🤬
The better part is upgrade timing updated🎉
bro i was so happy to upgrade my hero hall to unlock grand warden and third attack slot for attack. but Instead i wasted my book of building to upgrade the hero hall to level 5 but it upgraded to level 4. Now i got nothing
Have you been looking for this demon-faced creature for a long time?
Why tf supercell gave archerqueen at townhall 8, it's meant for 9😭
Biulder be biulding there health. Want more biulder huts? Mabe move hero upgraid to hero hall.
New hero introduced is Minion Prince. The next new hero to be introduced in the future is likely a princess.
GUYS, SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHY I CAN'T USE MINION PRINCE FOR ATTACKING EVEN AFTER THE SWAP?
I absolutely despise the hero hall just a waste of resources and time
I’m sure someone has asked already but would you be willing to make a new optimized bases per town hall video again now that the banners don’t act as buildings?
😂they just keep ruining the game each update first global chat is removed now the eagle artillery???😂trashh
If I'm using minion prince on defence... Who should I swap him with? King, warden, queen or rc? And why
Anyone have the same problem of heroes cannot be boosted after the update😢. I have 4days worth of boost becuz i just relogin after a while but it does not work on heroes just the troops, spell and seige barrack.
Judo you said that in order to upgrade to Th 17 the game provide you a hero hall lv 10 but i was th 16 a little bit rushed and when i enter the game to upgrade  they gave me hero hall lv 7, and also minion prince only lv 40 😢 and also i succesfully upgrade to th17 with hero hall lv 7. Why is that happend?..
I’m TH14 it’s 12million elixir to upgrade hero hall level 8 what will it even do?
How to boost hero regeneration time??
I’m sorry AQ at th 8 that’s jacked I did so much grinding at town hall 9 for my AQ
Hav a question wt will happen if we upgrade hero hall?
Help post:  I upgrade my town hall 16 to 17 . It takes some days but in my war base there is townhall 16 and eagle altillery disappear from war base. Please solve this problem as soon as possible because clan war league is starting soon
They messed up with making the minion prince being upgraded with dark elixar and not elixar.
Man the bigger minions he spawns with equipment totally should have been 2 mega minions, missed out imo
Honestly after playing with the minion prince, i find it really good, but just one lore change would make it a hell of a lot better, it would make sense for him to summon mega minions(from clash royale) instead of what he does now and it would make sense, he is a prince this he has 2 mega minions as knights (as they xome with armour in ckash royale) it would really tie the universe better than whatever they are called rn
Did anyone notice since the update the training potion doesn’t speed up hero healing like it should
Sad the eagle been removed? Should have just merge town hall and hero hall as 1 unit
Why are the heroes not included in training boost or training spell? How can i boost them?
I'm TH16 and the tutorial provided me with Hero Hall level 9, I was able to upgrade to TH17 without upgrading my Hero Hall to level 10. So why is that? And my Minion prince is level 60. It didn't start at level 70
I can confirm this I'm fixing up my bass but I was a rushed Town Hall 9 for a long time I'm still a town hall 9 I'm still rushed but I'm almost done upgrading my town hall everything maxing out for Town Hall 9 I um and I have a level 3/4 minion Prince that's because I was upgrading him but yeah you do start out at level one for the minion Prince because the minion Prince is maxed out for Town Hall 9 at level 10
I know it's too early but who do you all think will be the next hero? Its a princess right?
All my TH16 bases got updated with Hero Hall level 9, and Minion Prince level 60 which is exactly what I got with my TH15 bases.  Either Mr. Sloth misspoke, or there is a bug.
8:20 you can still press info on hero’s and upgrade them from there without going to the hero hall.
Let’s just be honest the new hero is trash, even at lvl 40 he sucks
I switched one of my hero’s for minion but still says I have the previous hero active when I search for match? 🥴 lol
Training portion are not effect to the hero after hero hall appear (after update). Only troop, sig machine and spell, but hero not regenerate fast.  Please check this problem, and how do we make sure the Training portion are generate our hero faster in the hero hall?
The fact that minion is not susceptible to seeking air mines but minion prince is
Why like 3 days ago when I was doing hero upgrades it only costing me like 80-90k in dark elixir with a 2 day wait period (with battle pass) now it like 2x that for resources and time on the upgrade
Guys how do I boost my heroes regeneration? Ever since the update I havent seen how to do it
Does the training potion not work on hero regeneration anymore since they're in hero hall? Description of training potion says works for hero regeneration, but for me it's still taking full time length. Can anyone help?
It's weird not hearing "hi, my name is Judo Sloth" at the beginning lol
Honestly hate the idea players get minion prince at 50-70 but other ppl have to go through all those upgrades that’s not fair, I mean ppl max out so quick why make it easy 😭🤦‍♂️
Bruh The training potion didn’t word on hero. 😢
I can't use the minion prince help
I mean yeah it’s something new and cool but stupid if you have the hero’s you should be able to use them??? This update is silly just to have everyone excited for a new hero…
Minion Prince looks like Chino Moreno
With the heroes now being in the hero hall, if you use a training potion it no longer affects hero regen times. The heroes are regenerating normally. If this is part of the "new features" this sucks. And if this is a bug supercell should fix it fast as I just wasted a hero potion.
I am in th 10 but i did not get level 10 miniun prince 😢😢
Why does the training spell no longer speed up the hero recovery. Is that a bug?
So, you can't take all 5 heros into battle...   well, it's not worth wasting time upgrading to the final town hall. 😅
now thats some satanic looking hero
Mass dragon attacks have never been easier
Why almost No one talking this new BUG???    Some of the heroes are taking much longer heal after each multi battle, and training potion doesn’t work on them!
Archer Queen at town hall 8? 😳 This feels so wrong. 🫢
I am so glad I left CoC in 2017... Shame that players keep feeding the unimaginable Supercell greed, but oh well.
Queen cheated on King 😂😂😂😂
Can someone please tell me why my training potions no longer work on my hero’s ?
I am a returning player at th12 and my king is level 69 (max is supposed to be 65) and I somehow have minion prince level 40 and RC unlocked?!?!?
My th is very rushed, I recently became back, took it to 13 and started slowly upping my defense, my minion knight is higher level than any of my other heroes xd
So when I go to TH15 soon i have to spend 16 million elixir to upgrade the Hero Hall that takes 12days to be able to upgrade my heros next. Just  to wait even more to finish upgrading heros. It's organized you can say that but honestly so dumb.. Unless im missing something here???
They should remove the use of builder when upgrading heroes. There's no hero altar anymore.
Bottom line minion prince for air attacks.  Can’t see it beneficial supporting ground attack
another cost for upgrading heroes @ th13 needs 14M  elixer -_-
looks boring
Ugly hero and looks evil, we dont like that.....
Would have liked a new hero at th15 and 17 would also like to be able to upgrade heros without builders
I quit playing this game but still watch videos just to keep up with updates. Maybe that means I still care about this amazing game xD
Not gonna lie this update really screwed my base up I’m th12 trying to max out, then I get the hero at level 30, and now I need to spend 9 mill on upgrades just to get the royal champion now aswell after upgrading my th
I do not like the fact that you cannot attack with all 5 heroes at all.
I started playing clash when I was 7 at 2013 and loved the game. Me and my brother would be competitive with our town hall levels and such and it was a blast... I remember finding out that I cant put my base at the corner of the map because the walls were not enough. Now I'm th13 and the game feels empty. Ever since the builder base rework and the new hero abilities stuff I just do not enjoy the game. I tried to start playing it again but no. I think this last update was the last nail in the coffin. I think every new addition they added since the beforementioned update was terrible...
Don’t like the hero hall should’ve just added an extra hero bed
In my opinion I just hate this New update. Clash of clans is changing 😢
Sad that the training boost doesn’t use  in heros
Might be the worst update in coc history. Starting to rival the greediness of clash royale.
Very nice update as a hero rusher
Not a fan of the hero change
been playing this since month 6 or 7 and i have to say this is the worst "update" ever in the game. what a waste. they're just pushing more and more.
TH dont have giga bomb now , that's really vulnerable to all nearby buildings , and surely blimp attacks will now rule over TH17 for sure 😼😼
So why can't i take all heroes into battle again?
Come on bro I worked so hard for archer queen and barbarian king and now it’s so easy for beginners!!
Watching the game grow like a bad seed. Miss the og game . No skins for 50$ a month stupid Fortnite like battle passsss like F off
what is the max level of minion prince at TH 13?
Why does the minion prince look so ugly tho
I am a th13 and was in the middle of my gw upgrade , with this new update I can see my gw is at level one and the royal champ missing, getting to unlock her was an experience but now she is not there. And the minion prince is also at the level 20.  I am kinda disappointed tbh.
If coc cares so much about making room for more buildings then they could’ve just merged the 4 mortars.
Welcome back to the channel then guys i am your host judo sloth
How do we use the book of hero’s
New hero with personality is coooool feed me more
what’s the max level of minion prince of th10
I'm feeling like a mad scientist doing math for clash of clans👨🏻‍🔬
Did not like minion king
To be honest though this update sucks for me cause it's too much complicated  now 😅
Sion
Is this update available now?
9:00 an obstacle, but I believe it still prevents troops from spawning near it--it has an area that troops can't spawn around, unlike most other obstacles
Hi  Now with the new update my town hall is 14 and I got hero hall with the update so when I try to place it the game kicks me out with no reason anyone face it before!
Do you guys like the minion hero or should they have used a different troop to make a hero?
Wait why they removed the bomb 😠
Royal champion isn't having all that.
2:35 bro what a dumb update, why would they do this?? 3:12 WHAT! This is absurd!
Electro dragon as hero will be better than minion😢
O jogo ta bugado
So annoyed that my TH9 base dosent get a lvl 3 hero hall so i have to wait 4 whole days just to be able to use both the heroes i was already able to use, real bummer for wars right now 😭
I really thought we can use 5 heroes lol
im having trouble about my account i can't place HERO HALL on my TH14 alt account whenever i place it, it lags and kick me out of the game and it never been place i tried it many times and still the same happen except on my other 3 TH13 account i can place to those.
I've got 50 level minion prince as a th16! But my another clanmate got 70 level
Is it me or do others also think like he looks like satan
they could've removed the upgrade timer for heroes or not requiring a builder when upgrading them lol
2:28 the queen is unlocked at th8 now? Damn.
and even tho you have to upgrade them by first upgrading a very expensive building, you STILL have to use builders, even tho the upgrade is suppose to work the same as a laboratory.
Zombie Archer Queen really looks creepy in the hero hall
Its area damage in tiles is 5 in game. Did they nerf it?
I got lvl 40 minion prince 😢😢
Missed opportunity to call them mega minions
They definitely left the door open to releasing many more heros
I can't place my hero hall 💔 it always close the app directly as soon as I try to place the hall
I just realized about the update on play store after watching your video 😂
The new hero hall is amazing, so convenient
please make a new base designs... thank you
Training potions aren't boosting Hero Regen anymore! What's your thought on this?
I just don't the fact I gotta upgrade a building before I can upgrade my heros... or even get a new one... it dumb
Man. As an unmaxed account, th14, I don’t want to allocate another builder to this hero hall while tryna srush a secondary account. Definitely slows things now. I don’t really understand the necessity of this hall either, but I guess it’s cool. Regardless, new th is cool and so is the direction the game seems to be going in. Just hope it doesn’t go too over the top with these changes.
Just another building to upgrade before we can even start upgrading heroes? Man i hate changes that make tedious things even more tedious
What is your Creator Code?
I observed that Grand Warden on defense mode is not counted as defense anymore just like other Heroes.
I dont see why this was a thing. Why add another building when you still have alters? I get the idea of keeping things "simple" but when you are already doing things with the alters, it just seems pointless to add a hero hall. It was simpler beforehand, now it's just extra steps. And merging the eagle with the town hall is even more dumb when they couldve just merged the mortars instead since they are pretty much useless. Whoever is doing the update ideas needs to work elsewhere
Hello judo, have you ever had a real job?
The new hero flags no longer show hero's health timer on how long you have to wait till they are ready again. They also don't seem to heal faster with Training Potions now... bug?
Hello  Judo , we Minoin Queen better or Queen better ?
The new hero should have been the prince or princess
@4:55 Supercell mechanic to determine Hero Hall level for existing TH16 further widen the gap for players to catch up on upgrading Minion Prince.  Unlike what is demonstrated in Judo video, TH16 player don't necessary get Hero Hall 10, Hero Hall level are determine by the maximum hero level for the particular level. e.g. Player 1 with BK59, AQ61, GW45, RC24 will get Hero Hall 7; Player 2 with BK60, AQ61, GW43, RC26 will get Hero Hall 8; Player 3 with BK60, AQ55, GW40, RC41 will get Hero Hall 10, etc   Yes, Player 3 with RC41 will automatically get MP70 vs Player 1 MP40 vs Player 2 MP50.   Therefore, lower hero level TH16 player will need to spend over 3-4mil dark elixir for MP to catch up to MP70 that other TH16 player that gets Hero Hall 10 just because one of their existing Hero beat HH10 requirement. Basically, current mechanic further widen gap for player to catch up on upgrading new Heroes.  Should similar mechanic remains when Supercell decided to introduce new Heroes, it will be impossible for lowel TH player to catch up on upgrading Heroes given the disadvantages of such mechanic.
Huhuhu me starting lvl1 not lvl 30 T_T UNFAIR LVL 50 BK AND 60 AQ BUT HUHU MINION LVL 1 NOT EVEN LVL 30 T_T
hero hall not placed my clan why the issue
May be wrong but didnt the warden statue give buildings in its radius more life but never did it make a air def take more lightings
Hero Hall should be named Tavern
Minion prince placing sound is the same thing as Archer queen but male version
The last hero it looks like anti satanic
Having played with this update today, I wish a few things were different: - pet, equipment and hero buildings should be merged into 1; we really don't need all 3 as big buildings on the map - on lower THs, you now need to wait a few days to upgrade the hero hall, whereas before, it was an instant unlock of the new hero - using a builder is not nice, but I suspect if they ever decided to make hero upgrades work like pets, we would only be able to do one at a time, so I'm not sure I want that. - I have a foldable phone, and the skin selection screen doesn't work as the UI is cut off (all other screens work fine, or at least scale down so all buttons are visible; this must be an oversight)
Gonna make new layouts because of the new buildings?
i wonder how many mo th can they add until it become absurd
My king is 55 and my queen is 62, but my prince is only 30? I still appreciate it not being level 1, but what is max level for prince at TH12?
Its bugging I cant place my herohall HUHUHUHI
I'd just like to know what upgrades I should be doing first thanks!!
Yes
Hi Y is the game Hero Hall its kicking me out of the game
Hi I need your help with Hero Hall it just kick me out of the game
Is it just me or they just deleted my Christmas tree collection after this update😢
Yo no puedo sacar la casa de los héroes porque me saca de el juego no se que hacer no me permite que lo descargue en el ayuntamiento no entiendo
I was able to upgrade to TH17 at hero hall lvl 9, it gave me a lvl 9 HH bc my heros I guess weren't quite high enough as you said but HH lvl 10 was not a prerequisite for TH17.
Supercell is very greedy; just to upgrade heroes, you are required to upgrade the Hero Hall first, otherwise you cannot upgrade the heroes.
Game turned into clash of heroes fr smh
😢but cannot boost now all heroes to fast regeneration boost regeneration is useless now 👎 worst update for me
After the update the hero update cost increased🤔
Amazing and sensational game! I've been playing for over 10 years! I collect all the themed obstacles, but I wish there were more "Shovels of Obstacles" so I could organize my village. Maybe a bundle with 10 or 20 of them would be great!
Goofy ah new hero I ain’t using it
Look like satan
so I have one day left on upgrading TH12 to 13 to get the Royal Champion, now with the Hero Hall that needs to be upgraded to level 7 which is 9m elixir and 8 days to upgraded so kinda bad timing
I just hit max th13 and now I have an additional 10 hero levels to upgrade. Not stoked about that at all.
One of the worst updates game doesn’t even feel the same I hate it so mucchhh
I was SO worried that I had to upgrade 70 levels of the new hero😭
So basically the Hero Hall changes next to nothing and is just something else to upgrade and waste our time with
Getting the Queen at TownHall 8 is  one of the biggest changes Supercell has ever done to this game
Tbh to save space we could get rid of the black smith to save space if you can access it in the hero hall and you can switch the equipment in the army ui anyway now
I’m taking a shot every time this guys says hero 😂
Nah, Archer Queen belongs to TH9
12 ads in a 16 min video. Jeez
They should have done the same thing with minion prince equipment that they did with him
So CoC is becoming Castle Clash🔥
Nahhh they remove eagle for that😐😐😭
Hi any one observed training potion is not working on heroes after new update
I was so close to maxing out my TH14, now this just added an extra hero to max out, and new pieces of equipment to upgrade also. Thanks supercell you sure know how to keep players grinding.
Training potions no longer speed up hero recovery. I am astonished it was not mentioned in this video.. what a horrible update. They increased upgrade times for almost everything in a secret update before the hammer jam was finished, another thing no one is talking about. What a horrible greedy update by supercell. I’m disgusted
Waiting for Klaus to use minion prince
I've seen quite a few people complaining about the hero hall, when you unlocked a new hero it would be instant and you could enjoy the hero boosts from a new TH. It's also ridiculous that Supercell wants players to wait a week or more just to start upgrading heroes. I don't think anyone likes the Hero Hall.
I think they will add more heroes now...with townhalls and they will become a core part of strategies later
Imo, the hero hall is just useless….. and extra 12-14 days of builder busy in that per level…. Because  Previously we could upgrade heroes right after upgrading to the next th if we had maxed heroes for the previous th….  But now we have to upgrade the th first then wait to upgrade the hero hall which takes like 10-14 days to complete and then start upgrading heroes…. Personally I am very disappointed with this….. As a th 14 who has maxed heroes currently…. Was planning to upgrade right during after maxing the remaining base leftover to max it for th 14…. After hammer jam is over…. But now first upgrade the th for 12 days then upgrade the hero hall again for like 12 days… then I can start upgrading my heroes…. Like seriously…. Truly ridiculous
Judo the decrease loot amount again Even less than first time
Alright buddy I'll start using your code on purchases, you're always helpful
Bro i can't place the hero hall in my th14 account 😢 help me bro
TROOP BOOST NO LONGER BOOSTS HERO RECOVERY TIME WHAT IS HAPPENING?!
Goodbye Grand Warden
Me and my friend both are th 15, my heroes are: Queen 80 King 78 RC 28 Warden 53 Why is my Minion 50 and his 60?
What would be the max level for minion prince for th11
We have a queen at th8 now?????
I need help to place down the Hero Hall. I am HARD crashing when placing it on Android and PC (via Google Play Games). Please tell devs, Judo. I already put in a support ticket via in-game. CLAN GAMES need to be done
Still upgrading uses builder not good
This is the most useless Upgrade  You can't Lavel up your hero  Without Upgrade your Hero Hall F#$K😂
New Hero and Hero Hall was amazing but I ain't getting upgrading heroes in old version because the Hero Hall looks like a laboratory 😢
I don't like new update..
5:06 About hero hall, I’ve got anything maxed but not the heroes so they instead gave me a level 9 hero hall but town hall can still upgrade to level 17 so probably not a requirement that you need actual maxed hero hall at that level to upgrade town hall
hero hall was not necassary at all❌
Why does new hero looks satanic
Was happy seeing my minion prince at level 30. Especially considering I just upgraded to th 12 a few weeks ago
there's nothing more helpful than Judo's videos tbh
9:12 that was unexpected
4:18 when placing hero hall always shutting down..why? just upgraded to town hall 14..when i ignore placing hero hall i got no heroes at all 😭
Bro, i upgraded my Th 16 on 15 november and i got minion prince level 60 with hero hall level 9 in Th16 don’t know why supercell did this with me this is so disappointed bro..😞😞😓💔
i cannot placed the hero hall building at my village the game will automatically log off or close i tried uninstalling and install and many things
Th8 is disbalanced with quinn, it's always 3 stars for now
total bullshit update man. why cant i use this 4 heroes at the same time
So with this extra hero, What would be the best heros to use for base defense?
Prince 70 doesn't make sense
When ever I try to place  hero hall game crach I tried switching in other mobile it still not working 😢
Helper Hut Bug: Just click on your townhall
Wthhell my BK lvl80 AQ lvl80 GW lvl55 RC lvl30 but supercell only give MP lvl50 😢😢😢
Bruh this is annoying af💀we have to upgrade 1hero at a time and they changed wall price from 2mil to 4mil(14 to 15 walls)💀nice one👍🏼
Sir please help 🥺, when I am attacking, Client Error coming 😭. I lost my 3-stars attack 😭
Nah mann ,coc becoming toxics...old was good
As a ground attacker prince is not that worthy for my attacks😭 but still mine is level 70
I just think that they should let minion at th8 not aq at 8 it just doesn't feels right and the fact that the hero hall is overpriced the fact that to upgrade my hero i need to upgrade it considering the fact that the heroes are already overpriced
How’s the minion price with ground attack?
Why th the training potion is not working on regeneration of the heroes??
this happens AS i’m upgrading to th15 😭
Why minion prince looks like that
I still havent found out how to change skins now,lol
This update is awesome.  Love the new hero mechanics.
14:49 freezingggg those gold mins 😂😂
Nothing calms my “update anxiety” more than the sweet sound of a Judo video
I ve put my king up from 87 to 88 after the update he was ready to 88, they did me a big favour😂🎉❤awesome😊
But after town hall 17 we can't see blacksmith hero ability two together 😢
There is Barbarian 👑 and  Archer 👑, then where is minion king 👑 is 😅 instead of giving minion prince 👦😂
So none gonna talk about the elixir and gold cost changes?
I didn't understand their logic behind using builder to upgrade the heroes anymore! If there is a hall or dedicated builder for heroes they should be like pet research like upgrade which doesn't need any builder. Using builder to upgrade heroes should be stopped.
Thats satan. Am uninstalling the game fr.
Can you use a hero when it is upgrading now?
I thought it'll be a hero machine from Builder Hall's builder.
Pointless
1=1m🔥🔥
Nice
Town Hall 8 getting access to Archer Queen is Blasphemy
I Like that He is alredy lvled up
India server is different your server different. In here not hero hall
Idk why people are saying stuff like “we are cooked” how does this stuff make the game worse?
Archer Queen on TH8?! That's insane!
Lucky me I have all 5 heros
I was just about to pass to town hall 14. Now i have to deal with this minion prince upgrades. It's at 40 now and i think i have to make it to 50? I don't get it and i hate it
What will happen to Hero Hall if my BK is level 50 and I am in TH 16???
Do u remember the most corrupted base you have built you can also use this unplaced item i mean hero hall
Why heroes can't boost the training potion I'm disappointed
Muy buen contenido
would be great , if hero hall acts as an defense like when it destroyed all heroes appears from inside and attack alltogether or defending the hero hall when attacked
Judo, this new update has glitch. When i deploy my hero house the game becomes quit automatically. Please fix it. I am terrified that i will  lose my 8 years progress. 😢😢 please help me to figure it out what's happening😢😢😢😢😢
Anybody else having an issue upgrading to th17 using a hammer? Game crashes immediately every time i try.
I’m a townhall 10, Already have archer queen and barbarian king at already decent levels. When I placed my hero hall it only gave me a level 2 hero hall, essentially taking away my archer queen from battle until I upgraded the hero hall to level 3. Such a huge hassle as I have to spend another 4 days on a forced upgrade. Why didn’t they already give me hero hall level 3? I got absolutely scammed.

I'm so glad I have another hero to upgrade, right before I have almost maxed out my TH11 🫠
Wow, all those town hall rush accounts getting instant hero upgrades 😂
Hero hall is a huge L
😡Nice!!!!!!! developers Polished diamond and made stone out of it. Stupidest update. And creators won't even say it because they are cowards because they are earning from COC. When We had all heros we were able to use them for attack and also keep them for defence. And when i take them to offence its not like someone going to attack my village.
Judo when i upgrade my hero's it left with empty space and it's so vulnerable to get attacked🙏🙏🙏🙏 please can you see it for your self
wait so my lv70 queen gonna be lv10 now wtf
My town hall is 14 and I am not able to place my hero hall in it. As soon as I place the hero hall, my game gets disconnected.
When i started to unplaced my hero hall. My COC will close
9:31 you know what Else is massive🫣
Why i cant place my hero hall?
Other heoros are all mage only bk is a attaker
Mobile is struck after update every attack it reply reload....
This hero is best for air attack  and we should deploy this  behind the grand warden
There is a bug of the hero skins display in the profile…
I think this hero is better than royal champion
So your telling me I was upgrading my town hall during the update and that means that because I was 2 days late in upgrading my th I now have to upgrade the prince by 10 levels ffs supercell
the minion prince already being upgraded is like when they made the hero equipment already upgraded when they introduced the equipment. As in, my archer puppet is (still) at level 14, the level relative to my queen at the time when equipment was separated just from hero abilities. it makes sense, and I'm glad Supercell decided to introduce it that way
Dang bro these are expensive enough already
If you go to the Attack section in the army training screen, you can click on the Warden, which will then prompt you to switch the warden from Ground to Air in your base and on your attack.
There is so many bug in the new update.
Can't place the hero hall. When I press on the tick button my game crashes.
Why all this hatred for the mortars all the sudden? I have seen this same comment on multiple videos. They should have combined the mortars with the TH because they're useless on their own. No they are NOT useless. Maxed out and supercharged they deal like 300 DPS because they only fire every 5 seconds. They can range a Flame Flinger  and are hell against mass troops like the spawned Barbs and Archers from heroes. Like every defense, they have their use. So stop with all the negative comments. It makes you sound ignorant of how CoC works
we will miss old hero altars
I did not like Hero Hall. Because here we are not getting any extra facilities. We are getting out what is in it. So what is the function of this builder? I think it would be best if the heroes could be updated inside the hall without the builder.
It's geting better and better 🔥
why i cant palaced on bass? It has automatic bavk problem. If i  take in base

Nice knowing u clash of clans 😢
Still waiting for them to add new sound effects on BK league skin
It all went downhill after Haaland
9:16 could you send the link of this base?
show me best hybrid base for th 14 after this new upade :D
Now I need latest th9 bases judo....
here after the update. is anyone else having trouble placing the Hero Hall? When I try to place it down, it just crashes the game. I've tried this both on PC and on my mobile devices, and it crashes the game.  Side note: The Helper Hut has no problem being placed though.
Wow so i need to upgrade the herohall now separate from upgrading the hero, wow i like to thank supercell for using more of my time, i think this is time to stop playing again after coming back.
When I place the hero hall it exit Automatically what should I do or is it a glitch😢
Did the update also double the price of every building? After I logged in it turns out to be a lot more expensive and the gold/elixir produced went from 100k to 30k per hour now😢
ratio
I’m ngl I hate this..
I feel cheated. I maxed th 13 during event and went to th 14 but didn’t put 1 more level into my one of my hero’s because of hero boost so I only got a maxed th 12 minion prince and now have to wait 9 days to upgrade any of my other hero’s
im on town hall 11 and everything is 2x more expensive… im not sure if ill play this game anymore
I have a problem. I cannot place the hero hall. The app stops. What should I do?
This is an annoying update, it cost more time now to upgrade And cost more elixir and gold 2x plus more as well as the heroes
i was so confused because i started upgrading 2 of my heros yesterday which would take 3.5(builder 2x speed from event) days but with this update they were done upgrading, amazing haha
This updated just made the game worse wtf
I just updated the game, when I go to place the Hero Hall, the game crashes. I reopen it, it hasn't been placed and repeat.  Edit, seems like a th14 specific issue.
That's good ❤
Minion prince doesn't look like a hero, he more looks like a villain 😅
Come live onces a week
You should you will tell how it will better for defence but forgot to elaborate on that
And he is uploading all th baesses❤🎉i like this
I can't update:((((
Idk why I feel like not playing COC anymore. It's not fun anymore
could you suggest clash of clan to allow using heroes while upgrading. i hate this part because i have to farm using invisible globin only when my heroes upgrading!
So we have to now upgrade a building first to upgrade our heroes?
its really weird that minion prince is the only hero that is not a human😂
idk why but his design feels already iconic
Nice setting 😅 that's mean we can always lvl up 1 hero full time since we always has 1 extra numbers of hero available 😅 so no need to hold up upgrade hero lvl just for a war 😂 the only cons is we can not upgrade all 5 hero at once to abuse event like hammer jam 😂🤣
Basically more work for us
I highly doubt you'll see this. But as a person who used to be in a very active family clan, currently struggling day to day trying to start a clan and can't war. Just wanted to point out because I feel alone in this matter. I think supercell should do the math and look at the stats to better understand the ridiculous grind for ores without being in a active clan. And can only earn them through star bonus, which imo the star bonus ore rewards is in in need of a buff on the ore side. Clan games needs to have them as rewards. Ive watched you pretty much since you started. First time commenter. To see you where you are now is amazing man. Congratulations and thank you for everything you do.
Me as a almost maxed th12 ( all defenses are maxed only the heroes and lab needs to upgrade.
I'm very glad that minion prince attack wasn't 10 pts higher
So the minion prince is just an 'extra' hero until they release better hero(es) than the other 4 🤣
I love this video❤. The explanation was on point. I also love the upgrades they've added to the game
0:41
Should i wait to open the game if i am upgrading the th from 11 to 12 to get higher lv of minion prince?
This sucks because it shows supercell couldn't add the... heroe
I don’t like this at all
When is th 17 coming
I'm proud of unistalling this game while I'm th16 maxed.
Not going to upgrade to 17 untill they make eagle return or something. Just merge mortars and bring eagle back as a quality of life update.   Eagle is superior to any - at last when nearby defenses are down and troops are taking down buildings for damage it's eagle which protect the base from further damage where other defense can't reach.
Man, should've given equipment lvl also Now we need to spend more ores on  other equipments 😢💔
Clash of clans is turning into world of Warcraft game soon we have 10 more heroes in the future
Why am i watching i deleted my account
Hedar update
Bro this probably be the worse update and the best update at the same time
Still uses a builder eh..?feels more like time increased taking into consideration the building of the hero building?
The heroes look like they came out from Dota 😂😂
7:32 wait so that means we can't see the heroes sleeping on the altar while upgrading or healing after being downed on an attack since the altars are going to be replaced with banners
New clash of clans April fools idea: hero’s not being used in the hero hall on defence are thrown out when the building is destroyed to fight with 1/4 of their total stats
Best thing is we will get level 70 minion prince instead of 1
ok, im waiting for the giant princess next!
When will th17 be released?
AQ at th 8 that's kinda illegal😅
It would be amazing if upgrading the heros without using a builder😂😂
No archer queen is a town hall 9 hero why change that ffs just gov the prince at th10
Judo i use your code every time when I buy
Weak azz th17
weird looking ahhh hero my goodness so ugly
Using minion prince with angry jelly and using grandwarden with fireball🥶
Update date ???
Everything seemed good until you said the hero hall actually works like the laboratory. That means we can upgrade only 1 hero at a time. If so thats the worst idea for sucking money
People are going to delete royal champion 😂
will the heroes be usable while upgrading once the update drops ?
Just when I thought I'd get to Max TH9 on all five alts in two weeks now i gotta deal with the hero hall and maxing a third hero 🥲
Hammer jam ended and still no release date? CHINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
So…we get a new hero but we have to pay for this new content by having yet another thing adding onto the time and cost of upgrading the heroes in form of the hero hall making them take EVEN longer to max….this is ontop of them now being extremely slow to upgrade already and even more so after the Ore system was added into the game…man…im glad were getting more content but my F-ing god its gonna take years and years to max your heroes now, star-ore is basically impossible to get enough of.
Works just about exactly how I thought they were gonna do it
Please say " kadavuleyyyyy Ajithey"
This update sounds okay and all but personally don’t like the fact that you now have to change between setting your hero’s to attack or to defend your village at least that’s my understanding
Judo don't forget to bringa video of base layout after the update
When it is started?
This update is ass
So no new pets ?
NOOOOOO! RIP DEFENSIVE WADEN
Hero upgrades will be easy and we can take 4 heros in attack now ..  great update 😇
Now upgrades will be easy
When the update?
no more rush base yes!!
Why do i feel like i've seen this before? A long time ago. The Hero Hall
Oh this is exciting! I think I'll use minion Prince over Royal champion!
Hero altars 🗿 Hero flag 🤡
What about th 13 minion prince gonna level 1
I wish they would remove the builder requirement to upgrade hero’s, it’s already annoying enough having to upgrade them😂
When is the release date for th17?
So the heros got nerffed... Now i can't straight up attack using all my heros anymore..... I don’t like this update at all.
I don’t have it how do I get it because I’m TH11
Poor king he gonna be left out
@JudoSloth can i use minion for lavaloon instead of queen as he can tank air defenses and mines
Does anyone know when the update comes out?
Question. If my heroes are below the max for the alter level like for example a rushed Th 14 base will my other heroes also jump to that starting point on logging in like the minion princess did with the level 70 jump
Not good for other players because they cannot use all heroes because of that stupid slot
When does this update come out
Having Archer Queen on th8 is kind of weird😂
Who else is watching it in shorts
They are just making the game more complicated, I don't really enjoy it as much as I used to do before because there is so much going on now, really miss classic coc days🥲
When this update will happen?
9:32 😂😂😂
Miss you old intro...
So I have a rushed th12 I was just looking on how I can fix it, like what do I focus on upgrading first
16:00 crazy blimp value
when is TH17 becoming live?
I'll miss the old Warden Statue.
When this update is coming ??
When is this update coming
Now I can upgrade heroes without losing every attack. :D
Bro your editor really need a praise 👌
This is ridiculous
Why do i not have the update? When can i update it?
1:38 I want hero Judo!
Town Hall 8 Archer Queen is crazy, how is no one talking about that💀💀
when is the next update?
I'm so glad we can get Minion Prince at level 70 instead of starting from level 1
I was so excited about this because I thought it won't require a builder anymore and it would work kinda like the library but then it still needs a builder for some reason... What's the point then😭
@Mrmeme1234max you're correct, we are cooked 💀
Getting archer queen at th8 os massive for how lower th attacks will work
We got judosloth in coc before gta6
Judo, my TH is currently upgrading from Th12 to TH13, so in that case will it give me TH 11 max MP or TH12 max MP (assuming my TH is still in upgrade process when update drops)
can you make bases in that update? also attack strat.
When is the update?
nice
"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. (1 Timothy 1:12-17)  ''Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.   (1 Timothy 3:16)
Does anyone know when update goes live?
Edrag meta
I need my old hero alters🥺🥺
Why am I seeing minion prince getting nerfed in future😅😅
When is the update releasing?
When is the update coming..
Oh no Slanesh and tzitch had a child
Im excited with minion prince skins lol
Not a fan of losing a hero in battle but everything else is great
*guys I found minion prince. In my base. It's in my channel*
*guys I found minion prince. In my base. It's in my channel*
*guys I found minion prince. In my base. It's in my channel*
Hero hall is lame af
Me: Oh, tomorrow I will finally be able to spend my dark elixir (storages are full) on heros upgrades! Supercell: Nah, we changed the whole mechanic of the game in one update, so you avec to wait 2 weeks before upgrading them…but it now takes 2 days for a new player to reach TH 11😅
I am at th 15 what level of new hero will i get???please reply
As a Hydra enthusiast I’m really liking this new hero
How did y’all update the game I’m not getting anything
When does this come out
Thank god minion prince comes in at level 70. Upgrading him 90 times would be hell.
Not really feeling the hero slots feel like I should be able to use them all in battle but I’m sure I’ll get used to it eventually still sucks tho
I don't know how to feel about the new hero. We are going to get cost and time reduction but with the new hero I feel like they are nullified and you have to upgrade 1 more thing
When does this update become available
I thought after hero hall released.. hero upgrade will not use builder anymore😂my expectations to high
Seeing this hero and knowing how chinese servers is gonna start cooking the hero design😢 but im playing in regular servers
Hello, Humans No matter what life throws at you, be ready to be great and bounce back from anything.  TERRANCE OUT
Wow queen at 8 🥲
W for the editor
Not gonna lie, supercell must've been high , hero hall? Why are they making it more and more like dragon city, etc other games.😂😂
7:58 depression
So, are they deciding to go the castle clash route cause that's what it's looking like with all these heroes and pet addiction. It looks a lot like a castle clash now
I'll miss old hero Altars 😭
Honestly without your videos i would have stopped playing this game a long time ago
Why did they not combine the black smith with it?
Judo is the goat clash youtuber no debate
A lot of memories with coc ❤
g😮😮😮😮
Which apk mode is this?
I think in next gold pass, we will be having minion prince skin. I am having champion set. So hoping for completing the set with 5 heros. 😁😄
this is very good, but eagle and explosion from TH17 when destroyed are removed, this is very bad!
Hero portion 60/5💀
Do you know that there is a minion prince hidden in the trees behind the super sauna
5:44  after hearing this i said without thinking  *Praise the COC Lords*
I dont like that i have to decide which 4 heroes i need probably just swap RC and Hero minion
Anyone, when is the next update releasing
I remember when this game was simple
I think it would be better if we have a normal human being prince, corresponding to the other heroes! Then minion prince can be a skin!
w
OMG I HATE THIS NEW VOICE WITH IA ON SPANISH JAJSAJSJSJSJ THIS IS SO EPIC THO
Whens the update coming out?
Wait so you mean, the Minion Prince is the Barbarian King and the Archer Queen's ...????? HUHHH??
when will this update come out
Во сколько будет обнов
Please add another builder
Minion prince ❎ Satan Prince ✅
Attacking at middle town halls just got so much easier😂
New buildings incoming bcz they are reducing buildings with merging and this hero hall
Whatever you say i really miss eagle artillery. I made an attack based on eagle location and its pride to destroy that machine
U've removed ur braces 😂
I think this is the first hero that doesn't look human kinda weird seems like they gonna go just like clash royale with the skeleton king
Justice for eagle artillery
I think the coolest thing about the update is getting the Minion Prince at Lv. 70! That’s just freaking awesome I tell ya. I didn’t see that coming, what a treat!
This was long due
5th heros no need to option out of war when a hero is down!!!
Totally cooked
Wow 😅😅
More buildings to upgrade wow. There should've been extra builders in the hero hall to upgrade heroes. So normal builders are spared.
Upgrading hero’s shouldn’t use up a builder slot imo
How many times can we up hero? One or more as we like? Or up like pet?
Does this mean we will be getting an update for the best bases for every town hall?
No more base rushing ig
Harmy  Harcher  👍🏻
More complex for new and noob player 😂
It will make hero upgrading more easy.I wish get it before hammer jam
Removing Eagle artillery from the game …I’m totally disappointed honestly 😢
Really stupid to have yet another expensive dark elixir upgrade. I wish we got a second regular elixir hero
Lame change imo. Why can't I use them all. I will prob not switch to the prince unless he op
Nooo... they even remove the og hero altar that's sad, but sometimes we need to adapt to some changes.
I took a shot everytime you said "Hero Hall"....I died
My base is cooked because of flags
will there be a possible video in the future that helps determine which heros to use on defense?
It’s starting to become too much for me. 3 bases, managing a clan, hero gear, clans games ect
Whens this update comming out?
Minein prince and an animal moving around the old og scenary🤨
Update date and time
When is the update coming
grand warden turning into statue while defending was unique, and i prefer that over a few defensive buffs that a mobile grand warden offers.
Everyone level up your hero once the update comes it will automatically be done
This update is so stupid, all I see or hear is SC running out of ideas but not wanting to give up the income
This new update is going to be a very odd/wiered transition into the future of COC.
When it will be that comes to play.??
does this mean no royal champion at th16?
Ok but when's the update ??
Coc is destroying them because the queen is an emotion of th 9
If im a th15 what level will the hero hall be when i log on?
Wait, that was the Private Investigator, who found the hammer jam, right? We recruited him as a hero!!?
with the appearance of Minion prince, it is possible that lies like pekka king, golem king & lava king will no longer be lies in the future...
Jadon will never be using the Queen again.
So this is about to turn into castle clash 😮
I'm so glad I decided to rush my Archer Queen to level 85 and leave my barbarian king behind lol.
Worst update 🤤
Air meta incoming?
Wait won’t it then not able to see the skins when I’m on my base to view freely.
The altars should be in another location like a museum.
So when this comes out we have to wait til our building finishes to use hero’s or the hall will be built automatically?
Th 17 release date judo?
If we have the minion prince I can only imagine what the minion lord would look like
Worst townhall design, it doesn't even provide me feeling of townhall.  Hero Hall design is supercool  Why some  defences are looking dark? Minion prince doesn't look like hero but a villian more.
bro what is even going on, should I come back?
New update?
When is the update happening
I don't like how the new attack strategies are blimp reliant. This requires very active clan mates which is always hard to have. I also don't want to use raid medals on giving me clan castle troops either.
I'm so glad we can get Minion Prince at level 70 instead of starting from level 1
Games dead - been fun.
Must say TH17 looks sick, besides the cool upgrades I love the whole dark style
new players have it so easily nowadays 🥲
I don't have hero hall I'm  town hall 10
When is the update dropping?
What will happen to book of hero or hammer of hero now??  Can we still use them
When is the update going to come our
I feel like I’m on LSD watching this
pls inform us when update
pls inform us when update
Another OP, few months later Supercell will nerf this again, after players maxed it. then it will happen.
So uhh when is this coming out???
Judo sloth a coc hero in the game
Awesome
Hate the aesthetics in this new hero! Should have been a lavahound hero instead. I blame michael the minion.
Is this launching dec 1?
when does the update release??
Aww i wish the minion princes spawned minions were the mega minions from clash royale. Knights to defend the prince
Why don’t I have the update yet
Ik the minion was a new hero xd
Nah thats bs. I want my altars back
When’s the update?
The prince saw my internet history
I'm so glad we can get Minion Prince at level 70 instead of starting from level 1
Well look VIP
Though the new hero is interesting but I would love to use the old heroes - King, Queen, Warden and RC
Gracias por el doblaje a español judo!! ❤
Rip statue, still this is better but the statue looked cool.
Town hall got huge nerf
When is it coming ?
It’s fine adding even more dark elixir, but let’s at least get another drill, getting too much now. Builder base update is much more needed in my opinion, don’t need another TH yet
We have come along way Now we we have 5 heroes 😅 I can't wait for 10 heroes all at lvl 200 Town hall 💯
When is this update going live?
They gonna nerf the dark orb equipment in 3 months
Ngl, Im really excited for this update. I think the new hero could change things up a bit
Nah this game is dead for me , just too many things to do and too much things to buy to make a decent account and enjoy it
Seriously???
I don’t know if I like this
Please create a base layout for th11 with new buildings
I can live with these changes
minion prince gonna be cutch for my lower th accounts
Cool we got spyro as a hero
Supercell is so uncompromising when it comes to heroes. So many levels for so many heroes, and they still require a builder. At the very least they can stop requiring builders for heroes. Doesn’t even make sense considering troops don’t require a builder.
❤❤❤
how do i uptadate the game?
7:56 to get an answer to my question and it broke my heart still.
Interesting. When does this come out?
So many changes over the last year. It's kind of a put off
This new update with the Hero Hall is gonna hurt my head to use. I'm sure ill understand it but its so confusing. Also I personally think they should keep AQ at TH9 and put the minion prince at TH8. Also you mention that the hero hall puts the max level of the previous hero hall level on your heroes. Does that still max out if you are a rushed player(say you have a level 65 Queen at TH15 would the prince still be at max level for that Hero Hall or no?)?
😂😂😂judo really a hero guyz
Now we can level up one hero at the time?
When will it be release?
So does this mean i can't upgrade my heroes at TH17 until i upgrade my hero hall?
I have a question if i have a new th16 but my hero lv is only 76 will i get the minion prince lv70
How come I don’t have the hero thing? I just turn level 11 a couple days ago and I can’t find it?
When you upgrade heros do they sleep?  In this update
I wish they took off the time for hero upgrades, i feel like it should be instantaneous because there are so many levels for heroes
Minion prince, the new hero I saw was like the form of Satan the devil who was in Satanic and in the middle of it. I'm a bit scared and not in the mood to play Clash of Clans.  Is the COC producer not doing well? 😢😮😢
Thanks to you, I upgraded the Town Hall to 15 with a book a few minutes ago, and the Queen to 81 with another book. I had been saving the books for some special occasion and they worked great now... So I saved a Hero Hall upgrade and 10 levels of the Minion Prince, who will be given to me at level 60, instead of level 50! 😁😁😁
This is bs
When’s the new upgrade ?
Minion prince , looks like some kind of demon pretty sick if you ask me and not in a good way
When is this update coming out?
Coc makin keren aja sekarang. Pertama kali saya main coc tahun 2015. Walaupun kebanyakan pensi nya😅
When wil it release ??
I know some kid is gonna complain and supercell will comply because that's what they want to do is piss people off and nerf anything you paid for. That is why I'll just not spend money on this game.
Man CoC has gone down hill.
I found him spying on my village on the top of the loot cart, he just apear in a split seconds before vanishing in the bushes, why is he spying on me😅😅😅
its good but why is the hero equipment is level one thats just stupid
When this update comes out ?
Grand Warden be like i will not beg you to use me 😂
Wait wait wait I'm th13, when this update comes out can I  still use all 4 of my hero's in battle, or when it comes out am I going to have to build and upgrade the hero hall multiple times or will it come already leveled up
Because of minion level being the max of prev town hall level, I rushed 3 of my bases up 1 th.
Can't wait for the update 🎉🎉🎉
So basically they are copying castle clash in a way.
Might be the excuse I need to walk away from this game!😂
When this was comming to clash of clans
Is the equipment going to be level 1 though?
Cant wait to mqx out the prince equipments and gets nerfed hard and released another OP eqipment tk lvl up again 😂
1M views in less than 12 hrs. Damn 🔥
Bro just make him start at lvl 1 like royal champ 😭
Am I the only pne who sees how much the new Hero looks like Sully from Monsters Inc?
do my hero levels reset after the update
Why don’t I have any of this and I’m town hall 10
More complicated 😰
What happens to the hero level
This sounds like a bad update
So we get queen at th 8 now wow  Why didn’t I get this back in the days
He looks so nasty
As someone who’s been playing since 2014, I really like this update. Very refreshing
I guarantee weaponizing the hero hall will be an upgrade at some point
Sorry guys. It’s gonna take you 90 weeks to max out your dark minion Prince. 52 weeks until next town hall
Not a fan of new the hero altars. 2x2 is going to ruin a lot of appearances on bases.
Should I upgrade my TH to 16 to get the level 70 prince minion?
It’s cool it’s just weird that it’s not human like the other heroes
This update is absolutely horrible
When do you expect the update to drop? I'm very curious!!
That's lame
They killin this game
Don’t know why upgrading heroes still cost a builder. It’s already inconvenient enough when they are out of battle… seems like they should not use up a builder now that it’s done inside the Hero Hall 🤷🏽‍♂️
I wish your videos pop up in front of my timeline instead of itzu, I like you way more
i have little baby heros, because im super rushed at th16, would the hero hall be level 10? giving me a level 70 minion guy? or would it be the th10 level like my current heros? therefor also giving me a much lower level minion guy?
Looks like they're setting up to remove the equipment and pet buildings.
if I hammer my TH from 14-15 right before the update drops, will it give me a higher level minion prince?
When does the update come out?
when is the update coming out
Ahh we finally have the mega minion in coc now
0:53 BUT I JUST FINISHED MY TOWN HALL 11 BASE 😭😭😭
I cant be the only one who’s brain is in shambles 💀
TH8 with w Queen WHAAAAAAAAATTTTT
another building to upgrade😢
What date will this update be on?
This is where the game dies😕
No cap that’s G.   A.  y.
when update?
1:35 judo sloth prince xD
What level will the minion prince start at for almost maxed th15?
No wonder they moved AQ to TH8 lol. Nice, we kinda always new if they added a new hero itd be a flying one. Welcome minion prince.
When is the update coming out?
Calling it now, in later updates, they're going to combine the Pet building and the Blacksmith into the Hero Hall.
Ngl, the characteristic of the Minion prince investigating TH17, and blundering about a bit. And getting caught by a villager, was very telling about how easy he goes down to Air defences xD
Supercell says we’re running out of space, so they remove the Eagle Artillery. Then proceed to make a massive unnessesary building for heroes that previously didn’t take up space…. Fantastic devs
i hope since the master builder can be recruit and work to home village , maybe we may recruit him to join the army to battle or war that would be cool even if he's not a Hero but a builder :)
WHY THE NEW HERO IS LOOK LIKE DEMON? IT LOOKS NOT GOOD 😵‍💫😵‍💫
When we wil get this update?😢
when coming th17?
When does this update drop? End of season?
Last seek peak ❤???
the hero hall getting bigger had me dying 😭😭
I feel underwhemled. As someone who never plays with Air, this update feels uninteresting to me.
Minion prince got a base lavapuppet equipment lol
sucks that it uses a builder but i guess it makes sense😪
Nooo  iwant they old one
6:09 as someone who rushed my acc this is true horror😥
Matthew 11:28
AQ at th 8 :0
Hats off on explaining clear on all your videos. I always use judo whenever I purchase in the shop. Thank you. Love from philippines
8:49 but poison and headhunter
The only thing I like about this update is the new hero literally every single thing else is terrible and it sucks to see
When is this update releasing?
Nooooooooo idon't want  anything i want the normal back plss🥺😭😭😭
Why on Earth is the Archer Queen at Town Hall 8 it doesn't make any sense at all Town Hall 8 is already very easy they're just making it boring
I don't like the banner i like altar more😢
when to release the th17?
archer queen at th8 is wild😅
The fire spitters should deal death damage when destroyed
What is clash on to💀
Ngl this sucks sooo much they made this game sooo bad at this point
i always wondered when coc will build interchangeable buildings😂 i didnt think it was gonna be heroes though… cuz with more updates thers even less space. i was sure either interchangeable buildings or the map size will be increased… now i think in 2-4 years they will still have to change the map size
When is this update live?
When will this happen
Just another way to suck the life out the game supercell got greedy
I'm a maxed out TH9 rn so Ima wait till the update to unlock these and upgrade them
This game is blasting in to city builder expensive.
Tomorow its the update?
Hi Judo, when is the update dropping? Today is 25th November(according to IST), end of hammer jam, so is that today or some later days?
Our Theory  COC Admin: yeah I'm gonna do this ODA in One Piece: Nope! I'm gonna garbage your opinion
@JudoSloth I just want to rush to th 17, but I know two town hall jumps would be miserable! I just wish it would come faster 😂
Looks like a fun update even for lower town halls! This is great.
So we won't be able to use all our heroes in a battle?
I saw that mf in the corner of my screen peeking through the trees and I was like wtf then I saw this video and was like ooooohhhh
Add 5 more  heros. People will quit more quickly 😅
Wt. Worst update
Morters need a higher level upgrade to make it seek
Will we have to upgrade from lvl one(hero hall) or it will be at a certain level off rip( hopefully it’s the latter)
Can we play with heroes that are upgrading?
Hmmm, so is it wise to rush to the next TH level so the minion prince will spawn at a higher maxed level?
I liked the hero and I liked that it was for almost everyone.
I didn't catch when this happens
I hope it also applies for other th like 12 and 13
Unmasked, unarmored mega minions
Looks fun and I’m glad you can’t use 5 heroes on offense or defense , it would be too op lol
They should call it the biggion
When is update  like after town hall 16 challenge is over
I am cooked
You know what else is massive?
So there is now an upgrade ie.(hero hall) before doing the hero level upgrade🤦🏻‍♂️
my poor barbarian king is about to spend the rest of his life on the shelf😭
Wtf queen at th8?? 😂
What will the release date be ?
unfourtanantly I'm only th 8 :(
Man, I wish it didn't require a Builder top upgrade the Heroes and that it would work like the Pet House. That would've been the creme of the crop.
This update was made for Jadon, he's defenetly using the minion king instead of the queen
I dont like this at all. All they are doing now is making it harder for lower TH to progress and ruin all strategies regarding any where you use more heroes. I think this will be one of the worst updates to date
Judo's editor, please take my commendation!
Removing alters was a good way to keep the building count down!
So rushing will help me lol
Ngl i kinda feel like this is ruining the hero's
I thought it would be the minion prince when I first saw his character in a trailer
When does the th come out officially
Omg so much  time for max heros
Happy with the changes to hero altars. Missing the old esthetic, though. I was tired of their altars being a building. I like building against electro dragon chains.  As far as TH17 goes, it looks WAAAAY too easy. Troops like witches are looking obsolete. I hate when base builder games make a component irrelevant with progression.   The removal of gigs bomb and poison were the worst decisions that really have me contemplating upgrading. I think I will on my main account only because I have 2 sub accounts.
I thought the Minion prince would have a minion puppet and the haste gem
That Hero Hall looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
When is th17 releasing
When will this update come for the casual players?
A NEW HERO!!??!!!! I can't wait for that!!!
This is too much tbh why take the alters out such a joke i like to see them walking round my base what i pay the skins for.
if you look near the super troop place he pops out if the bushes every now and again
😮
Th14_15 witch lvl of new hero n if I rush new th will help to get tl 70 instately?
So are we getting townhall 17 tomorrow?
Hi Judo, Just a question, my highest hero level is a lv 60 king and I just upgraded to TH13 and have a lv3 RC. Will my minion prince be maxed for th11 or th12?
We can still raid with all of them at once though right
I personally don't like this update a new hero is cool but sacrificing the eagle artillery?? Im also gonna miss hero alters
Wait I’m at town hall 9 but I don’t have minion thing
I wished Minion Prince to summon normal minion, like old heroes. -But I really want to see henchmens at Clash Royale-
So im a new th14 and my heros are at the level of a max th13 should I upgrade 1 lvl of hero so I change category?
Ok
How stupid so us maxed out guys . We have to build 17 times to use hero's in attacking. They better give us 20 builder books for $ 1.99 . Here we go loosing a bunch more players quitting 🤬
So if my archer queen is level 91, do I get a level 60 or 70 minion prince?
Do we get a place for all our decorations with TH17?
so archer queen got demoted to town hall 8?
I think it should’ve scaled from each th
Thank god he isn’t called the “private investigator”
More heroes more skins nerf buildings to keep them at the same level when new levels come out. After playing for years straight I’m slowly getting bored with it
What is gonna happen if i alread6 am town hall 8…
This was a downgrade fans we must rage
I cant find the update
7:57 The words of absolute distraught😭
So instead of getting a 5th hero, we're getting a new 3rd hero, and shifting the Warden and Champion to 4th and 5th.  My head is kinda spinning from the tremendous variations possible here though. So cool.
minion prince skins🤔
Helpful for so many people, don’t have to stress about not having 4 heros for attacks/war, epic!
judo, i need to know now, as a near max th14, should i be pushing for th15 before the update to save levels on my minion prince???
For Maxth players the Heroes Hall will be at lv10 automatically??
the anti rush update 👀
Can you upgrade multiple heroes at the same time?
Minion price will be massive when upgrading one hero and using him in there out time
Everytime I get to the next th after maxing they come out with a new th getting old
5:30 wait... So for example, im at th13 but my current heroes are under that th lvl, barbking has the most - 64, so that means my hero hall lvl will be lower AND my heroes lvl will be lowered too?? (To level 50)
Judo I love your vids, always top quality
They took their crib😢😢
watch  supercell nerf the prince within a month of crybabies....,  just like what they did with root riders & many other troops
I'll might use the king, champion, warden and prince for a air attack. While keeping the king, queen, warden and champion for a ground attack.
If the purpose of the herohall is to act like a laboratory to upgrade them why does it still need a builder when upgrading? It sucks that you cant upgrade multiple heros at the same time anymore
So army of drag with two hero directly behind them. Skill level is to press a button when hero is facing forward. Spam seems to be designed into this pretty deep.
Need a new base layout judo!!
5:37 Good thing I just got to TH15 thx to hammer jam lol
i kinda wanted a goblin hero that goes after resources
That’s so weird wtf
ay
Is the update coming out when the last th16 event ends or we can't know yet?
"Oh boy the rushers gon hate this " ah video
6:11 well mistakenly upgrading to TH15 is gonna pay off beautifully for me 🥶
Can you make a short video to sum up all new features with this update? And a little guide, what you should upgrade first etc.
I work my ass off getting my heroes to max levels for there town halls and now they take it away for this equipment mess
This hero hall thing kinda sucks lowk
What tf is this shoot😮😂
Great! This sucks!
L update
How many slots and heroes will I have at town hall 14?
I had a feeling that he was going to be our new hero. I just had a good strange feeling about it. Glad to see a new hero. Not for sure if I'm with the way they said it all up. But I'm not against it. Play long enough that I'm used to the way you upgrade and all that now. But I think I can get used to the new way. Thanks for the update, cannot wait for the new town hall to come out.
Nice
Wow another grindy update and i wonder why i quit this game
Would it be possible to upgrade 2 heros at the same time with the new Hero Hall ?🤔
I just hate the fact that supercell is reflecting the lower townhalls too much.
1:38  Judo selected as a hero,   passive equipment:   War map: can send you the best ways to deploy your troops at battle, including the numbers of the troops that you need to each part of the village  Active equipment:  Newspaper: can start a rebelion on the troops inside the defending clan castle (20 housing space maximum)
Scam 1:26
Upgrading a hero should not require a builder imo. Imagine research and pet ugprades required a builder..
I feel like defense will be impossible now tho that’s the problem I don’t attacks to be so easy or else it’s just boring
I don’t like that at all
Limited hero slots at th9 is outrageous 💀
Worst Hero Worst th update all trash on this update
the new guy is sick
Is there a delay on the update?
Can we use the hero’s while they upgrade yet…?
I kinda wish the minion henchmen were just Mega Minions, it’d be a neat reference
The minion prince looks hideous.
Bring back global chat
The king left the chat when he saw that he doesn’t have a special ability that is op also the king might retire soon
I hate this
Should I rush my base to th12 to get the higher minion prince hero levels?
I can't believe they made this move. And no one talks about how you now need so many more resources just to get one Town Hall level higher. I I, at TH 16, only have an average of 3 million gold and elixir.
Tell me can we still destroy th with lvl21 fire ball and eq with giant arrrow
I hope the hero hall won’t stop me from upgrading to th17
Wish it was mortars instead of the eagle   Also wit the hero hall that definitely means more heroes
Air attacks after this 📈📈📈
Is anybody selling a coc account?
I don't like having a new hero it kinda over complicates things and makes me think that I did all that work upgrading all 4 heroes for nothing
@When will town hall 17 come?
oww men.. i thought i can see 5 heroes in action..
Well, I just maxed th12 and upgrading to th13, now I’ll have all 5 heroes💪💪
Yo quería usar los 5 héroes a la vez
they cooked for the new hero... but not the troop, it's design is... meh... pretty basic effects and the spear just looks so normal, also doesn't fit the dark theme for the new th
So I’m almost a max th13 and I never got a hero hall. Why
Wow.. the game sure is becoming so much customised and flexible. But hope they maintain the balance between defence and offence
When is TH 17 expected to be released! Great review, Judo. Thanks. Love new hero at level 70 for TH16!!!
Man what are they doing? First they remove the Eagle and now the hero altars?! Grand Warden turning to stone was so cool, and the Heroes sleeping, damn I'm gonna miss everything. RIP OG Clash of Clans! 💔😔
Well i'm nearly maxed th15 and still using dragon so minion prince will be good for me haha
I'm just hoping the minion Prince will get skins based on the other heros skins, ex. Pixel, or clockwork
Can u oppgrade two heroes at the same time?
When will the update come? Been supporting you Judo recently. Keep it up❤
When is the update?
can i still use the builder apprentice while upgrading a hero. this is very important i didnt see it there
it makes no sense that the hero’s still use a builder now that there’s a dedicated building. it should be like the laboratory
It’s rlly cool , but I don’t like that you get 2 heros at th 8 and you can use the minion prince is such lower town halls it alsmost seems to op
Tbh this hero hall idea is bad since you get to use less heroes
Jadon will be happy for he no longer has to use the archer queen
They broke the game
castle clash ripoff 💀
Does it still need builders to upgrade the hero’s then?
I Hate that
I will never use minion prince
If I have heros going from th13 to th14 level when the update drops, which th level hero hall will I get?
ah sweet, dont gotta level him so much. i just made it to th13 and got the RC so i can focuz on leveling her and still have a 4th hero
RIP Barbarian King at Th17
Alvaro845 does the sneak peaks better than you 🥱🥱🥱
no to be ungrateful, but we’ve been waiting forever for a goblin hero 😢
Boycotting this hero who’s with me
TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SAY THERE WASNT GONNA BE A NEW HERO WHAT NOW HUH??
Too many spoilers bro.
Love your videos Judo❤ keep up the good work! Just wanted to ask if you will be making layouts for some TH’s after the update
New hero Judo Ability: Easily 3 star any challenge base😂
5:32 does it take a builder?
It still doesn't make sense that I have to use a fricking BUILDER to improve a hero's, a person's/troop's, capabilities: it does make sense I'm upgrading the battle machine with an engineer, because it's obviously a machine I'm trying to upgrade, but what are builders supposed to do to improve a hero's stats? Groom their hair, cut their nails and give them new clothes to wear??? I understand it's all fantasy and it's a game meant to drain your wallet, but I'd much rather have a mechanic similar to the laboratory where I can upgrade a single hero at a time instead of using the guys who are supposed to work on BUILDINGS instead. Pre-update you could sort of justify the builder requirement because each altar was, well, a building... but now it sounds like a "we want new stuff but we can't bother to change too much of what we have" so we end up with new systems with old mechanics that don't make sense...
Fantastic news! One thing though that's going take some time to get used to is having to upgrade the hero hall essentially forcing me to use a book of building to be able to start upgrading heroes. Not a huge deal. I would also like to see heroes not taking builders like how pets are.
It would have been better if the Minion Prince was level one…
So now would be a good time to ugprade town hall even if you arent fully completed? Since that would automatically give levels to the Minion Hero on the next town hall lvl?
looks like i picked the perfect time to return to the game
Im lvl 16 not maxed. My warden and royal champion are maxed but my king and queen are lvl 75. So what level minion prince will i get ??
If they made judo the new hero what would his abilities be? 😂
No more rushing😢since need to upgrade hero hall
I was literally jumping when I installed eagle artillery in my base. And now it's gone. Imma miss it. Big L supercell...
We need the warden defensive altar back. Please that was so good
Very annoying that it takes 15 days to upgrade the hero hall. I feel like it should be instant. Personally I start upg my heroes instantly to get a strong offense. I would have to get a book of building to do that now..
Release date when?
I don’t have it
When does the update come out though
I saw you added yourself as a hero 😂
Should give a lvl 80 Minion prince if your other heroes are maxed
Tbh i don't like the hero hall
This update is amazing
Anyone else thinking they'll do something like make everyone in universe miss the eagle and bring it back as a signature defense for TH18 or TH19?
Ngl its kinda dumb it makes you do more work to upgrade the th
When th17 realise
I hope they include PET for HOME or WAR BASES DEFENSES
That's a lame ass new hero 🤢
Does the hero hall mean that only 1 hero can be upgraded at a once? If so that’s a bit annoying
for confirmation th17 is coming tomorrow right cuz all sneak peaks 3 of them we have seen and hammer jam is also ending by tomorrow
lovely how you still need to upgrade the equipment for ores i do not have
Question:I have a rushed account with lvl 20 heros(king,Queen ,warden) And I upgraded to th12.what’s gonna happen to my hero’s will they still be the same
I don't like this
we need a new every town hall attack video
Th 17 release date?
prince walk unli revive 😂😂😂 th 17 defense so weak 😂
The best content creator award is no joke
When is the update coming?
New Clash of clans hero before GTA 6 😭😭😭       (Ik this joke is so overused but it's just so funny to think about just how slow the rockstar developers are)
will the other heroes will upgrade to? or the minion only?
Minion Prince is going to get nerfed so quick
This is amazing
Wtf
Love that he's a new hero but it is soooo much dark elixir to try and save up even before the 5th hero. Taken me about 5 years to get maxed dark troops and heroes. Be nice if they can lower the amount of resources to upgrade the heroes 😅
They got rid of the Altars and I hate that! The altars were core COC aesthetic and part of the DNA of this game and it's...gone...replaced by some...flags??? The rest is AMAZING, but this...this is just...I hate the removal of Altars. I get it - it's a space problem too, but man...idk...
Nah I don’t like it the town hall was cool but at town hall 7 and den upgrade it idk that is weird
Looks like my grand warden is going to hard carry the new minion hero's level.
It would have been sooo easy to make hero upgrades not need builders, but no
Archer queen is now unlockable at TH8 instead of TH9?? Man, I feel old now
so im a th12 max, im only finishing the last walls, will my minion prince be at th12 max level?
This game has more and more demonic undertone
When does the Update come out?
I miss warden statue and alters
Wow... this was an awful idea!!!  What were you thinking, Supercell!?
They still need to reduce hero upgrade costs, they're the same as they were when it ment something to level heroes, whereas now high level equipment can carry underleveled heroes (I should know, I've done it with my royal champion when I unlocked them)
So once someone gets to th17 they then have to wait 15 days to start upgrading their heroes? That’s stupid
Expand the territory ❌ Delete buildings ✅
How is the hero hall helpful in the game?
What time is update
I'm an almost maxed town hall 12. Thanks to hammer jam, all I need to do is max out my warden, king, some walls, resources, and lab stuff. My queen is level 65, so does that mean I'll get the new hero at max level? Or will I be stuck here for longer?
Judo what is the zim-zalla-zetter ? Is that for decoration or else ??
200iq, instead of removing 4 3x3 useless mortars, they remove the best defense and add another 4x4 in its place 😂
Does that mean that you won’t be able to upgrade heroes when you upgrade your town hall? For example if you have lvl80 queen (14th max) and upgrade to th15 can I instantly upgrade my heroes or would I need to upgrade my hero hall first.
I am sad that you cant have all heroes defending. Only because i really enjoy my skins in the game and now i wont be able to see then all. Especially wont be able to see them all if i use the same heroess on defense and attacking because then there will be one heroe left out
Excellent! Now we can upgrade 1 hero while still being able to take the max amount into battle.
When is the TH 17 update
So I’m half way through TH 15.. what level will my minion prince be?
You are legend💙🌹
Minion prince looks a bit bizzare but hopefully we’ll all get used to it. I still hate royal champion the most (right now I’m a town hall 12 +1 ⭐️ Tesla weapon with no plans to go to 13)
They turned it into Minecraft 😐  Now every attack you have to: Chose troops for strategy Chose spells Chose siege machine Chose HEROES to take to battle Chose which ability for each hero Chose which pet per hero
When is the update dropping as I haven’t received it yet
Hi my coc account have a problem my otp is not working i have supercell account i been trying yo open it type please give suggestions that might help
Why is Supercell making us upgrade the building. I can't believe we have to upgrade the building just so we can upgrade our Heroes. Big L
Jadon will never be using the Queen again.
God im so excited,  Day one player here.
Bro i was playing this in 2017  This game change to much
I like that the Minion Prince is unlocked at TH9, glad to see Supercell cares about lower Town Halls too.
THIS IS LITERALLY CASTLE CLASH NOW
I want PEKKA as the next hero
I’d rather they let us attack a base with 5  heroes I don’t like the idea of putting my king I’ve been working on for 10 years on the bench
So i cant use my heroes until they're upgraded??? Never mind
judo can u do  a new video about best bases for every town hall because these new building please 🙏🙏
When does the update drop
So a question,  what if three heroes are max and one is level 68, what should we expect... asking for a freind
I'm new in th12. Should i upgrade to th13 to get higher minion prince level?
When will this update coming?
So we get a new hero but i have to give up one of the heroes 😂that kinda takes the use out of the minion hero if you ask me. Why not just add a 5th hero slot?
Hero hall? that has a nice ring to it
judo is the goat <3
This update might be the reason I uninstall the game💀
@JudoSloth  One question I have after seeing the warden move on defence is that will the headhunter target the warden now?
I’m at th12 right now so what level will the minion prince be at when this update releases?
Why do I keep getting your videos in spanish!!
Why is Henry Cavills face now on the grand warden? 😂 anytime I see him in the hero hall, that's what I see.
Wow… this is a good update no complaints this time
I haven’t got the update yet for some reason
new best base for every town hall video LETS GOOOO
Finally less rushers in my clan 😂
Does this mean i get the Minion Prince at th 12? And if so what level does he start at
Ok but did they fix the Queen’s face on the anime skin?
Someone working for Supercell 😂
Yeah, I don't have the Hero hall even though im TH 11
New game: Take a shot every time Judo Sloth Gaming says the word "Hero"
i hate this update
THERE’S TOWN HALL 17 NOW?!?!?!
Do you have to have a builder available for the hero hall when u first place it?
I dont like this update,as someone who mostly relies on the hero abilities for attacks,this is terrible and then then not being able to have all heros on defense ,there just rying to make room to add more stuff to drag more players in,this update would only be decent if they made i so you didnt have to use a buider to levle it up like it is with the troops
Basically a Barb king's and Archer queen's far lost cousin
Wait so if my heroes aren't maxed the minion prince will match their levels when building the hero-building? At town hall 16
Man...I am really hating the non-stop updates. I don't get a chance to rest from finally completing all of my updates. It's become stressful and consuming of both time and money to keep up with this game. I've been playing for years and have spent a small fortune on this game. The new push for updates and events all year round is just making this game feel like a chore now. I'm probably going to quit.
Minion prince!? Are you telling me I've been sending in baby minions to war this entire time? 🫠
PLEASE DO A BEST FARM TROPHY AND WAR BASE FOR EACH TH AGAIN! ALSO DO BEST STRATEGY FOR WAR AND TROPHY PUSHING FOR EACH TH
So if I upgrade my th will my prince have a higher level?
not a fan.. it’ll take some getting used to
Wait... If we rushed to 16 but neglected our heroes will I require 40 levels of heroes and two years to upgrade to TH17?
It's really cool that lower th will get the new stuff too, not griding for years to experience it.
What coc?😮
11:15 what are these regenaration times !?
amazing news
Nice but That mean im gonna lost  days upgrading hero hall before I can level my hero again kinda suck
This is some retcon bullshit
They should remove the blacksmith. Such a pay to win mechanic
You can see the minion prince by the super troop station sometimes
anyone notice they lowered queen requirement to th8? thats insane
If only the hero hall works just like the lab without a builder
Never change the Barbarian king he is the base of every attack
Can you use the hero while upgrading?
W
Does this mean hero upgrades don’t require a builder?
excited for minion king very soon
Looks good
Are you able to still use the hero’s on defense while upgrading? Also no hero’s while upgrading in war?
So I'm curious now after tow attacks our heroes goes on cooldown so if we switch a fourth hero is it on cooldown or not?
The only thing I don't like about this update is the union of the Eagle Artillery in the Town Hall, the effect of the weapon on the town hall seems more like a multi-mortar than the Eagle Artillery, so it was better to unite the mortars with the town hall. It seems more like a nerf than an upgrade because now you just need to destroy 1 building to eliminate 2 while before the town hall and EA were 2 separate very strong defensive buildings and you could put them in 2 parts of the village far from each other to maximize the damage. Also the removal of the mega bomb from the town hall seems totally useless to me because it was precisely the combo between bomb damage and poison that did the most harm to the troops, with the explosion a good part of the troops' life was taken away and then the poison finished the job, if they really wanted to remove the mega bomb from the town hall they could have made it at least invisible so as to be more strategic and instead no, it is also visible in the village
If I’m th11 but I just got there and I have level 40 queen and king if I upgrade to level 41 will it save me and upgrade of my hero hall?
Ngl, the Town Hall just breaking with no explosion is pretty lackluster.
When is town center 17 going to be released ?
Can you tell us when the update dropps?
But I really wish that hero upgrades don't need builders...
No more rush base. I love this
Love the Minion Prince! I've been wanting a purely air-based hero in the main village for ages now so I'm excited to use him, and I like that he's a Minion instead of a human (though of course being more humanoid than normal Minions) since it makes him feel even more unique
From what I’ve been seeing last handful of updates-is that they are trying to refresh the game to make it more tactical in a way to try and extend the games life
When is this update?
HA HA RUSHED PEOPLE ARE GONNA HAVE LEVEL 1 MINION PRINCE CAUS THEY DONT UPGRADE HEROS
While upgrading heroes do we can use them for attacks?
Why are we still using builders for heros and walls
another useless update.
WHEEEN THE UPDATE, I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE.
Yeah judo not gonna lie, I dunno how to feel about this one, if this is what they want it'll take a long time to get used to
I’ve been saying the hero slot thing for months
They probs wanna do something about rushing. 😢
I hate that i have to upgrade hero hall also it's pain now
A wonderful update, I have nothing to say, but simply that minion doesn't really look like a minion... if they changed a little of it, it would be perfect. It's a game for all ages and maybe most for children and children assimilate the better and faster information... I don't think it's ok to call something with such a sat**** tone as a "hero"….
Wasnt there supposed to be a new pet  Kinda noticed it but no Description
Don’t like how the hero hall needs upgarding with a builder and then still requires builders to upgrade the hero’s just adding extra time to max hero’s
Goblin prince
Will i get lvl 70 prince if my queen is lvl 50 but my champion is max lvl
I really hate this mechanic change like you can't upgrade your heros right away you have to upgrade your hero hall but does upgrading your heros should not require builders would have been great
The Hero Hall is TRASH
So if i upgrade my th first to lvl 17 and do i get +10 level =80 level Mp?
They should make it where you upgrade your heros instant just like the walls
I am so glad I quit this game, I could not deal with another hero.
There should be 5 heroes defendig and 4 attacking to make it more difficult
Tell me the update date
I like everything except I will miss all the unique resting/upgrading animations they have for heroes, assuming they are going away, I didn't see them in the video when upgrading like you used to
Game uninstall button ✅
"High Damage A-Hero"
Wait I just became th9....and was so glad to have queen. Now th8 can also have queen? It's so unfair...
why would they add one new buiilding thatp plays along with the heroes and also needs to be upgraded. Upgrading heroes was already overwhelming, now we need to upgrade one building in order to upgrade our heroes...
So should we rush town hall for the level of the minion prince when it comes??
So sad to see the equipment isnt automatically upgraded somewhat, like it was when the blacksmith was first introduced. Upgrading equipment is emotionally draining LOL
Sad to see that there is no new seige machine and a pet.
Why this video is so long. He is explaining everything like he is explaining to a child and he is repeating the same thing again and again
I have to say, I think the UI for this new update looks really good. Overall I think they have done a really good job making the new designs intuitive and accessible to both new and current players
Heros having their own building and still requiring a builder is annoying, but beyond that good update
Will we be able to use hero while they are being upgraded?
Its so overwhelming 😭 🐸
In order to get a level 10 hero hall at town hall 16 do you only need 1 max level hero?
so shouls we rush TH for max value?
i thought the minion prince is a pet 😂😂
I really wish there was exclusive troops for the new town hall like it used to be
WHY DOES IT TAKES A BUILDER I HATE SC
I am not seeing these updates
I want a mega minion puppet so bad
Almost max TH 15🥲🥲🥲
So do i lose my heroes bacause my hero hall is level 1 ?
I truly can't stand the minion prince's face.
Bruh why did they remove multiple hero upgrade you need to wait the other hero to finish before upgrading other that's time consuming not gonna lie 😢😢
I kinda dislike how they make heroes feel like another tropp :/
so can we use our heroes while upgrading now?
Supercell had always been holding back on adding new heros, but now with the new system, that opens the door to add a lot of heros to the game
When does th17 realase
less go we get the new private Investigator hero
The game has gone so demonic, I can't take it anymore. This is gonna be my last season. Good bye COC. 6 years down the drain.
I like how supercell is managing the ever increasing content of COC. Makes me feel like finally returning to the game!
I’m th15 and my warden is level 56. The max warden level for th14 is 55, so does this mean my minion prince will be as high level as it can be for th15?
Does the minion prince scale with your lowest level hero? Or the highest? Or average? My barb king is level 80-something and my queen is upgrading to level 94 and i have max warden and champion. What level will my minion be? 60 or 70? If i had nown i would have maxed the king toooo
This is a pretty cool update ngl, even if it's gonna take a couple of years before we can experience th 17 content, the fact that the minion prince is for th 9 and higher is actually surprising but well done, I really appreciate that they're reworking old systems and are gradually introducing new content even for lower town halls, thank you Judo for covering the update you're the best (:
When is the update dropping?
Wonder how the game will cope with all the th16 lvl 1 defences and hero bases, will the heroes all be upgraded to max th15 lvl?
imo shouldn't use a builder anymore to upgrade your heroes
I feel like this update is very bad cause taking only 4 heroes into battle while having 5 heroes feels weird
When’s the release date
Super informative & comprehensive video, well done! Ty!
when is this actually coming
requiring a builder to upgrade in the hero hall sounds stupid
my minion prince is gonna be higher level than my other heros
Thats just wow, Good job Supercell ❤
16:06 Why just max?  Please, we need lower town halls as well.
RIP hero Altar
We will need new base layouts now
Th17 changed a decade-old hero system to a newer one. This new system opens up possibilities for more heroes, and in the future, more heroes will likely be added.
@JudoSloth you can't decide to call a banner a flag because you feel to...then what's the point of stuff having names?
I remember when clash of clans was actually fun
when is the update?
Have anyone noticed, the minion prince looks like BUTCHER from THE BOYS?
Wait so TH15 prince is level 70 and TH16 prince goes to level 90? So you still need to do 20 levels?
Getting the new equipments at level 1, now supercell is just testing our patience. Glowy Ore is a pain and Supercell are not willing to understand or listen.
We got minion prince before gta 5
With the Hero Hall, you can only upgrade 1 hero at a time?
I'm so glad the new hero isn't locked behind town hall 17
The all TH8 and TH9 clans are eating this update. 🍝 I wonder how their strategies are going to change.
Would love it if judo could bring us a new best attack strategy video for each town hall.
When does the update drop?
Please disclose the pricing too for the bed one that's why we are watching whole video
I KNEW IT I KNEW IT WOULD BE THE MINON PRINCE HOW COW
Honestly, I don't think a new hero makes a huge difference. And have little disappointment with the new hero's appearance.
😢 nahh made it bad not as expected😢
I don't like this
When does the update come into effect???
Does upgrading a hero still make it unusable in an attack?
Are we also getting a lvl14 equipment if we are th16? Starting from lvl1 will take so many ores😢
when’s the update dropping tho?
My clash on my phone  won't have any of this I can't update!??
Th18 hero should be the healer princess,trust
So update drops tomorrow after hammer jam ends?
ngl this update kinda got me on the ropes here my OG clashers never forget what it used to be because changes are coming
I miss your original voice in English judo .. i speak Spanish and enough English to understand your videos😊
Archer queen fitted so well with th9😢
👎👎👎👎👎
I don’t like how Clash of clans is making the game so offensive and no balanced
Salute to you man! How simply and easily you explain everything is impressive 👏
Need builder base update
Didn't they give us levels on equipment for our th level when equipment was launched?
Haha, that hero hall building just keeps getting larger by the second.
Boring hero boring hall of town
I think the accessibility with hero altars was better But now you'll need to do everything inside that building but that's only my opinion
I'm a bit confused with the "Minion Prince will already be leveled" part. I'm an almost maxed TH14 (only walls and lab left) with max level heroes. If the update happens before I go to TH15, will my hero hall (and thus the Minion Prince) need to be leveled to the max for my town hall as well? If so, it would be worth it for me to rush TH15 before the update, so that my hero hall (and Minion Prince) will be on the minimum of TH15, right?
WHEN DOES IT RELEASE IS THE QUESTION!!!
When does it release ?
I’m at th15, does this mean I have to upgrade the hero hall until I have all slots available for my heroes?
ngl kinda a weird idea imo like how you just have to skip 10 upgrades and automatically get a level 70 hero if your townhall 16 doesn’t seem fair for people below T16 who have to actually go and do the super expensive upgrades manually
That’s amaz8ng I can upgrade my heros without hurting my defence capabilities
When is the update dropping?
so now the only difference between upgrading heroes and upgrading troops is that we STILL cant use the heroes while they're upgrading.... got it.
Though I somehow dissapointed by the thought of attacking with 5 heroes not happening, attacking in wars with less than 4 heroes can be a game changer, appreciate the idea so that I can constantly upgrade at least one hero without hurting much of my gameplay
my rush account is screwed if the hero hall level is dependent on prior hero level 💀💀💀
So I’m just a little confused I have a TH16 base that’s been rushed and my heroes are very low level (like BK level 19) etc so what level hero hall will I get and will I be able to upgrade to TH17 right away?
So will you get a hero hall based on your townhall level or will it be based on the level of your highest leveled hero/heroes? I just recently upgraded to townhall 16 but my highest hero is at level 90 and the rest weren't close to max level for th15 before I upgraded. I was just wondering if it will give me a level 9 hero hall because of my th15 level heroes or will it be based on my townhall 16 level alone and give me a level 10 hero hall?
If I am 1.5 months away from max th15 would it be worth to rush to 16 to get the minion prince at a higher level?
so who right judo if itzu? we got hero 70 lvl at 16th if its will calculates our hero lvls
when is the update coming out
Wait, so right now I'm th11, if I upgrade to th12, will my minion prince gain more upgrades?
They want to add more heroes in the future, and each hero will have its equivalent in troops. That's why they added the Throwers, to ensure troop consistency with the Royal Champion. I believe there will be more heroes in the future
I’ve stocked several dozen runes for th17. Only code I use is for you my friend. Thank you for the detailed and focused videos.
Minion prince 🔥finally a hero which is permanently on air mode😎
So here is my query : If one of my hero level is 66 on th13, will i get the max level of the minion prince? Because level 65 is max for th 12...
So rush to th9.... got it
I hope after new th release.. New best base layout for every th will be release too.. ❤️🤗
Supercell never fails to amaze... Just as they left me awestruck with this hero hall upgrade, and the ability to swap among heroes we're willing to use, and also make accessing them way more efficient, at the same time, SUPERCELL left me Absolutely dumbstruck with the removal of the Damned Eagle ARTILLERY!!!! ... As one fellow youtuber commented, merging 4 mortars and the town hall would've made much more sense then merging the eagle with it
Hi bruh coc consuming  more data and data is quickly finished any solution u know tell me jodu sloth
Air attack will be dangerous this th also broken like th16
They need to nerf hero costs if it’s going to cost 250k de for some hp and dps
When is the new town hall coming
Great supercell !!! New Héroe from the beginning  ❤
Honestly the only thing that is not amazing about this update is the warden statue leaving forever.
When can we expect the update
Lots of new things in coc, but for new players its gonna be a nightmare, and finally coc will start losing their market with no new players joining
Don't see the update in the store i, m th11 do i have to be 17??
When does this update drop?
That’s dumb why Minions? This game is trash now
How many times do you have to unlock your heroes
After i unlock minion prince i will replace Archer queen with him FOREVER
I honestly do not like this because I in a Townhall 12 that just upgraded from Townhall 11 and I use all three of my heroes for all my attacks.
i have been playing coc since th10 and watching your videos and both channels since th 12. I always enjoy your way of explaining things and the way you bring information and make it easy to understand. As a sign of appreciation , i always support you and your channel with every purchase i make in the coc store. keep the good work up my friend and always looking forward to seeing your new and lovable content. Much respect and love Judo.
When does the update release ?
I thought minions were ignored by seeking air mines
My rushed th16 has hero level below 20. I am gonna enjoy that level 70 minion princr
What day will the update be released?
When will TH17 arrive?
So no matter the town hall level there’s no way to simoultanously use all 5 heroes in battle?
Thank god we are getting the minion prince upgraded to level 70 honestly that was my biggest issue about that hero
This update is ass
Soo... the update has you fiddle around with the UI for 20 minutes just to fix your heros and how they've always been just for ONE attack? Glad I stopped playing then game a while ago.
I feel like they need to give us new pet and rare equipment levels , every five levels your heroes abilities would get stronger, that doesnt seem to be the case with this town hall, we are just increasing health and DPS
Everything was changed, remember how you feel when you first buy a king 👑.. rip the og altar 👑 😔
I don’t like the idea of this new hero hall thing 😖
What about town halls lvl 12?
I find it strange that hero upgrades still use a builder despite the builder not working on a specific building.
Judo I don't like fact that you have to assign your heroes to protect your village that doesn't make any sense
Nah man , Barbarian king alter was so nostalgic 😢
Fans judo sloth is here?
Do we know when there will be this huge update? Will it be immediately after Hammer jam event?
E.Drag and drag attacks will be much easier with the minion prince.
am i the only one that dosent like this conspt
We barely got any troops levels,no defense levels,and no super troops. And the town hall is too easy..town hall 17 is a big flop and I will not be upgrading to th17 I’m just gonna stay at 16 untill 18 comes out
I hate hero hall 😑
So we can still only use 4 Heros but have 5 ??
At face value, the hero hall looks great, but it wasn't discussed whether the time for upgrading of the heroes decreases as they implement the hero hall or does it stay the same. I'm kinda concerned since that would mean more upgrading time. It's also kinda bummer since you can't upgrade your heroes right away anymore to dump DE when you have your TH upgraded to a new level. I usually do this so I can maximize resources and get into attacking right away. Lastly, there will be 3 buildings that requires elixir to upgrade as soon as you have upgraded your TH. Usually, lab and CC are your main concerns when starting, but now, you'll need to add the Hero Hall into the mix.
So I need to upgrade my TH before the launch of Hero Hall cause ill be stucked with upgrading it first.
Can u make a video bout how much time you have spent in your clan
Will the minion prince get new skins?
Me who imagine whole time pekka will be next hero 🙂🙂
Honestly, this is closest thing we'll get to using hero while upgrading them; we'll always have at least 4 to use when one is upgrading
Clash SURE has changed over the years... DANG! :D   Great vid Judo! :)
0:41 what is clash of clans becoming 💀💀💀💀💀
Why couldn’t they just add the hero hall without removing the hero alters and why did they have to remove the grand wardens statue form while on defence it looked so cool 😭
Judgement day is coming    It's very obvious.
GW on defense as a hero also means he won’t be directly targeted by flame finger or other defense targeting troops
Tuff times for barbarian king
Neat
Can we use heroes while they are upgrading?
8:50 You say the Grand Warden is stronger on Defense now, but can't he now be poisoned?
When does the update come out out?
R.I.P warden statue and eagle artillery…..
I think Minion Lord is a better name in my opinion
Now my barbarian king won't be rising for a while
It would be really sick if supercell will drop an eagle artillery statue. Rip og defense 🥺
dark orb getting nerfed the moment ill max it out
I've never been happier to have upgraded my heroes during the hammer jam event
This is dummm
I'm tired of upgrading the heroes 🥴
When will the update drop
I really liked the Warden Statue. It's sad they decided to remove it.
Bro we gonna need updated bases for each town hall
When does the update drop?
when i can get this update?
I know its a hero form of a dark elixir troop but wouldn’t it be nice if it would have been a normal elixir upgrade like the grand warden
Great, more ore to spend as always.
Castle Clash merger soon to be expected lmao 😢
Great edit and info on this new update 🤣
Ngl it shouldn't use up a builder when you upgrade a hero. Just like in the pet house.
when is the update coming out?
bro that’s such bull not being able to use all of your hero’s is such a bad idea. i wanna be able to use all my hero’s after spending millions of dark elixir on them. this update really just promotes rushing even more now
Idk. My heros max TH 15 and if they are in updating process in frist LV of TH16 (ex: Queen up to 91). Coc will give me new hero at LV of max TH 14 or LV of max TH15? Should i must offline few days until finish hero updating progress. Plz give me some advice😭😭
Jadon is going to be real happy he dosent need to use the queen anymore
Shouldn’t they make it so that you get the minion prince after the royal champion
Bro is well explained in place of supercell 😂
it’s nice to notice the pun within the words “hero slot” cuz it’s spelled just like (judo) “sloth”
Nice to know im not the only one who spent hourse perfectin a layout yet still cant rmember where the key building i nteract with are and search everytime lol😅
This good if U upgrade Ur other hero U can use 4 hero
When will the update actually be out?
Please bring back the chests😢
I would've loved to see a Wizard prince instead
Ok but getting minion prince directly at lvl70 is such a CHAD move from supercell!
Wait! so I don’t have to wait for 4 years to get to th 17 to get the minion prince 😱
Honestly I don't like the hero slot thing but the minion prince looks cool
We need a SUPREME WITCH HERO
Why I didn't get the hero building?? Iam currently th9 and builder is working on upgrading my th😢😢
This is now too much for me, I don't even wanna continue to play coc now.
Ha,e becoming more and more hero center ed king like castle clash
When does this update starts
question, if i’m a mostly max town hall 15, with mostly max heroes, should i go to 16 and upgrade a hero one level above town hall 15s max hero level to get a level 70 minion prince or will it not work like that?
I thought they would give an upgrade on resource collectors as it was teased
It is little hard to understand 😂😢😢
Wish the minion equipment would be increased based on Town hall as well. Equipment needs a cost reduction!
Supercell low key made the henchmen puppet equipment icon look like sully from monsters ink 😂
Instead of minion prince coc should include giant Prince
Let’s go! I’ve been waiting for this one
i hate this hero hall
It’s not real
RIP base rushing
So slightly neglecting my hero’s levels really gonna come to bite me in the back eh
This is not even clash of clans anymore. theyve gone way off plot.
i lowkey dont like this update
In case no one else asked, when should the update be scheduled for release? Is it tomorrow or 2nd december?
Bs from supercell hence why we don't play any longer
You should probably save all of your books and hammers of heroes for the Grand Warden now unless he's max because I can't see you ever wanting to have to swap him out but the others would probably be ok. Also, I'm glad as a TH13 that we get to use the minion prince, I was afraid it might be unlocked TH15+
Where do that eagle artillary go
Where do that eagle artillary go
Are you still not able to use heroes that are upgrading?
Unnecessarily long video, just get to the point man jeez
I was so dissapointed when he said that we still need a builder😂
i am max th13 what might be my minnion prince can someone help me and if i upgrade my townhall to 14 will it change the lv?
The defence is getting even weaker now, the game's biggest issue is the balance
When will the update drop?
Also when is the update dropping???
You talk to much
Love most of this, but do not like that before you can start upgrading your heroes you have to wait days, even weeks for the hero hall to upgrade. Hero levels were already a huge grind and adding more time to that does not feel good.
When the th17 Will be realeased?
Me noting down the notes instead studying for my upcoming exam😭
I am glad that they put the minion prince at th 9 it is helpful for lower town hall players
ig i was wrong i thought i saw something about new pets
if minion prince is possible where is my goblin king
Now Jadon doesn't have to use the archer queen anymore. This is the best update ever
So what u saying is my heroes i already have will also level to the max level for th16? If so ill he so happy will save me 10 lvls of upgrading
Judo pls answer see already sc spoiled our lower th fun by reducing hp but now they adding extra hero if they would bring any balance def to balance it otherwise Lower would die especially in tournament
Can't wait to have to upgrade another building b4 maxing heroes 😢 bad change imo
Judo throughout the video: This is the minion prince, which I will get to in a moment
I thought we can use 5 heros at the same time 😅😅
I will miss the heros altars  😢
From now on ,we cant upgrade 2 heroes at a time ? is it like that ?
Don't level the minion prince eqs yet. I think new and better ones will come out in December for Christmas.
i can already tell it's an update that we will look back and say it was a bad update ( the nostalgia )
Finally, I’ve been wanting a second air hero for so long because the only other hero that can actually be in the air is the warden obviously but even then, he is a support hero(most of time, especially in air attacks most people like to use the healing time and eternal tome) and now we have a hero that can fly who isn’t a support hero but rather an attacking hero. The only thing I wish you could do was give him a ground and air toggle like the warden because he won’t be that useful on ground attacks even if you take out air defenses because you still have to deal with the air bombs and seeking air bombs
Well, we didn't get the possibility to use an hero in battle while upgrading, but having 5 heroes and being able to only use 4 is almost the same thing. You can just upgrade one and use the other one. That's pretty nice
For those of us who use ground attacks how does the minion princess help?
When it comes out ? 😮
HI
Fantastic video and explanation! Ty Judo
9.25 And you know what else is massive? Loooooow taper fade
When is this update coming?
New update from supercell:☺ Judo sloth: 🤑🤑🤑
Are you gonna show us the 4 best heros to use for attacking and defending since we got a 5th hero?
L coc
this is great for both attackers and defenders. imagine defending against 5 heroes or attacking against 5 defending heroes. too much!
ain no way i gotta change my layout again
Judo your videos are really the best quality there is on youtube! Do you have an animator? Do you edit all by yourself? Really they’re amazing! love!!!
so can we use heroes while they are upgrading?
DUDE WTF THIS IS CRAZY FOR THE HEROS😂😂 ever since i heard they were needing to maximize the buildings on the base i said they should implement a system like halo wars were you can just leave your troops
Should I upgrade my th 12 to th 13 to get a higher hero level
if I'm TH14 and I have AQ at 79, I have to upgrade her at 80 for the max starter of the minion at th14?
They should have introduced a hero builder seperately instead of apprentice builder it would be nice as heros seperately gets upgraded without using main builders 😅😅
Upgrading so many heroes will be a pain 😢
3:57 bruh
When we will get the update?
Game is slowly turning into Castle Clash 😭
Why is the grand warden the only one that requires regular elixir can someone explained this to me please
You can upgrade multiple heroes at a time!! @ 7:49  you can see it
So I am a fresh th 16 with a king lvl <80 but a queen lvl 90. Cant I just level up my queen to 91 and I will get the Minion Prince level 70?
So, it release tomorrow ?
so i max my champion and artilery
so i am a almost max th14 besides heroes and walls, would you recommend upgrading my th to 15 so i get the minion as a th15 level rather than 14?
WHEN IS THE UPDATE COMING?
9:04 wait does that mean the old man warden is no longer immune to head hunters on defense 🤣😅
His Demon 😈
Аа
Still sad that u cant use ur heroes while upgrading them
Tge hero altars really looked cool, would have been best if they kept it instead of the flags
lvl 1 equips for th16 players is such a bad kind of joke
Who else is excited to be able to buy another skin to be able to complete your hero skin set? Ten more bucks? Yes sir!
Was hoping the Hero Hall functioned like the Pet House but its still good enough for me
I love this, gives them freedom to add more heroes while keeping it balanced and adding some strategy since you can’t take them all. The Hero Hall is a cool addition that makes a lot of sense.
I am a nearly max th9 with only heroes left ( Q: level 2, king : 27) should i just upgrade my town hall so i can get the new hero at level 10 ?
We have to get the minion to level 90!
When is this upgraded going to out?Please someone tell me🙏🙏🙏
Ig im rushing to next town hall
Before getting the update the orb freezing is going to be nerfed  And fun fact, right now if you looked at the bottom left corner of the base in the bushes out of the base you’ll see him
They are already teasing the minion prince as right now you can catch him popping up around the outskirts of your base when idle
My heroes level are king 75 queen 75 warden 65 and royal champion 33 so how much level minion king I get ??
What about quick train and if you upgrade a hero can you use it ?
New hero is good but man, Heroes are becoming more and more like Pets. Just make upgrading them not take a builder already!
Now its final that we have a 5th hero and we only use 4 at a time i was thinking that supercell should introduce new heros every th then since we only use 4 at once
I'm not a fan of this change. I'm not building the hero hall
Things just got more confusing now
Useless game coc will go down and disappear from server like google+
So what if our hero levels are less than is needed to have a hero hall required to upgrade to our town hall. Sorry if that doesn’t make sense but I am going to th 14 rn but my barb and arch are only level 56, warden 25 and champ at 15. Would my hero hall come at a level that is lower than is required to upgrade to th 14?
AQ is best
That’s the worst change ever
how does it work with clan wars? and can i use 4 heroes while upgrading 1?
I think the new hero is OP
This is not available in my account????
Omg there are so many rules with the heroes... my head hurts.
Am I the only one that thinks, we should be able to use all 5 heroes
Are heroes usable while upgrading?
I'm little rushed base with th10 and wanted to fix before moving to th11 but should I rush one more th lvl just for minion prince lvl?
Uselesss heroes home.... now i hate clash of clans and i'm going to quite coc and tell everyone to quite this game from my district now coc are going to useless like mig33 and migme 😡😡😡
Wait so this is what I saw last night during an attack on someone's base. It was hiding in the bushes outside of the base
6:01  oh no my heroes are kinda rushed 😂😂 im screwed i think
Prince being unlocked before Champion means we'll see him included in the skin sets but not her. Another loss for my girl.
When is the update
ok ngl the hero hall mechanic where you HAVE to max out your heroes AND the building itself in each respective town hall level is such a great idea, it practically soft locks you from upgrading to the next th level and rushing your base pretty much rushing is still possible, but slightly more painful because now you HAVE to upgrade your heroes and the hero hall before even touching the town hall upgrade button
Wth is this I am disappointed with this hero hall thing
when they will lunch the new upgrade
Bro I want my eagle back
Bro ask coc to not remove the eagle pls.....
people play boom beach for warship and clash of clans for the main base.
When does this update release?
What are your thoughts with these changes and how base layers videos now have to change completely from th7 and up.
I have a th16 denigrating account with level 10, 20 heroes will I have the maximum th16 level?
Fun Fact, you can see the Minion Prince Jumping around in the Woods of the basic scenery.
We should be able to change heroes and their respective equipments before 30 seconds watch time ends
Monolith same colour as th 17 i think 🤔🤫😅
why does minion prince looks like a malnutrition polio victim
So can we expect update in next 24 hours or it may take much longer? I believe th16 took a little longer after the hammer jam ended so that’s why I wondered.
Are there going to be any Black Friday sales in CoC?
And what if my other heroes are at lv 60-65 at th15 will i get max heros or just deal with it??
Thank you for the information
They have their own building, and yet we still have to use a builder to upgrade them...
I will never change barbering King
Man the Minion Prince is ugly af
Queen at th 8 why😞
😮😮😮 what what is going on  ulcer queen is unlocked Town hall 9 👁️👄👁️👌
This is gonna strengthen Edrag spam💀
I'm annoyed about how i didn't notice that the minion prince is a new hero, it was under my nose the whole time
can you still not use heroes while upgrading them?
I’ll forever miss you eagle and hero altars.😢
Judo is this in the game yet
Supercell will surely gonna nerf the minion prince in future
Que horrible esta el doblaje en español jaja desespera la voz
What the hell was that gold bear?!???!
Wait, does that mean our builders would only be occupied once for the hero hall since heroes are upgraded within the hero hall?
Are they going to lower hero upgrade cost? It only makes sense if they are going to add an entire extra upgrade before you can upgrade your heroes. Someone please explain why it would be otherwise if you think of it
Defense is so strong on the other hand attacking side I don't see anything strong.. Nowadays it's getting boring..
When does the new update come
What does suck though is switching the hero’s from defense over to offense for my couple of attacks, then switching them, and repeating that. I think it should be a toggle inside of the hero hall instead of taking you to the altars because i always forget to request troops. Let alone switch my heroes manually😂
can you pls do a video on meta equmpment?
Two questions: 1. If my highest hero is lvl 81 Queen, what level hero hall will I receive? 2. Is the pet house remaining its own building?
I really wished for little prince in clash of clans as a Hero But Minion prince is some what same with his henchmen
Lvl 70 minion prince is a W
the hero hall getting comically bigger and bigger from 9:21 was hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
If you have your heroes upgraded already to a certain level, would you get the Hero Hall correspondent to the closest next 10 levels (level 21 = level 3 hero hall)?
This is making lvl up heroes harder no? I gotta wait 15 days to start upgrading them with no booms
Hi judo sloth, I need your help regarding my account got locked recently, i have contacted supercell multiple times, but i am not able to contact there human agent, their bot is coming again n again and not helping me  please help, and contact me
At what th new hero will unlock
Like the update but the Minion Prince looks ugly af. Looks soo out of place compared to other heroes.
Archer queen at TH8 is diabolical☠️
Wow I had the idea of clash of clans creating generic hero altars around 2016. You can swap which hero you are currently using for attack and defense just like how it is now.  I was going to post it onto the ideas section in the forums but never ended up doing so… I wish I did so I can look back on it now lol.  But I’m also sure many people had the same idea , it’s a great way to slow down the power creep while still adding new hero’s
Btw when is the release??
Hiro upgrade required builder?
all my heros maxed
This is such a complicated shitty upgrade I hope this is just a joke
I was agast of him because we have 4 already heros  and all of them have already too many different ability 🙄😒 so he is useless for me
New sub bro
So they could add another hero at th 18 and make defenses stronger than ever and add the 5th hero slot for example VERY NICE
Minion prince have nothing unique.....maybe could have given him monster theme ....like king represent male troops....queen female......RC all justice type.....warden magical troops and minion prince representing monster troops and giving him different troops abilities in equipments like golem equipment,minion,druid,dragon etc.
nahhh this hero stuff is stupid
When is the updated comeing
Minion prince have nothing unique.....maybe could have given him monster theme ....like king represent male troops....queen female......RC all justice type.....warden magical troops and minion prince representing monster troops and giving him different troops abilities in equipments like golem equipment,minion,druid,dragon etc.
Does this mean it will no longer require builders to upgrade your heroes? If so how many could you upgrade at once?
Queen at th8 feels weird, its always been th9

This update not yet applied in our country Philippines.😢

That’s wild I remember having to wait till th9 for archer queen now it’s at th8 you get here man this game nowadays has a so easy
This update sucks
Do we have to max our heroes before upgrading our hero hall?
nah I quit
How about the new hero's ability? Is it upgraded already?
Bro how can i join your clan want to be a part of your team . LOVE YOU FROM INDIA. ❤❤❤
Naa bro old is gold
THIS IS SO COOL!!!
@judo sloth When will the update come
Awesome yet another dark elixir troop to upgrade
chat is this p2w
Should I Upgrade My townhall before the update arrives so I unlock new minion prince at higher level from beginning?  I am almost maxed out th10 just one skeleton trap level away 😅
So I’m a little confused. I just went to TH14 and my heroes weren’t fully maxed for TH13 but pretty close with 5-10 levels left on them. Regardless of that will the new hero hall be at the level for TH14 to still max out my heroes to 80-80-55-30? Or will it be at the TH13 level??
That sucks ngl
Just make the map bigger already 💀
Are we going to have to upgrade the hero hall or does it scale from your townhall. I would hate to wait to be allowed to use my 4 heros at th15
I KNEW IT HE WAS NEW HERO  qeustion when does the update drops? next month right? kinda sad we dont have altars anymore after the update R.I.P we gonna miss them!
you covered a slot with your video cam at 1:33 . are there any more sneak peaks judo👀.   i know i dont get any response :(
Hoping for ur reply for this judo....... You said if AQ level is 95 then we will get 70 level new hero............ But i am having 94 at the moment . Will i too get 70 level or below....... Then i will have my AQ on upgrade at the last moment of hammer jam
This is bad for low th
My barbarian is lvl 25 my th is 10 bro what will happend
f2p players as me myself is cooked as fk
I am at TH 15 almost maxes(walls and bomb remaining). So, should I upgrade my TH as you mentioned that we will get max level of Minion prince of previous TH level max hero hall to save my dark elixir to upgrade it?
If i am almost maxed th14, will I get minion prince level for maxed th13 or maxed th 14. All my other heroes are maxed for th14
this update fully kills coc👎
bro is just yapping
0:40 We all know the altars are gone because Supercell didn't want to design another altar
Where can we buy merch such as the tshirt you’re wearing?? I’d love a few for myself. Great video, can’t wait to start grinding th17
New hero is nice with slowed equipment
Castle clash 👀
why does the minion prince look like Antony💀 0:07
Is there any new scenery we are getting with TH17?
talking so much yet saying so little
Why don't they just add the heroes of clash mini?  Countess is too good to be forgotten
When is the update?
So now at TH17 we have to wait WEEKS to attack with 4 heroes. My trophy count is gonna go way down.
Massive nerf to heros tbh. Now instead of having them ALL defend your base. You have to pick between them. L update.
Now we can max heroes easily cuz we will use other 3 heroes while one will be on upgrading
this is an insane W
Let me guess, still no builder base upgrades
is there a date for the update yet?
why do we have to wait for a 15 day upgrade to start upgrading our heros?
IN THE TRAILER I LITERALLY GUESSED THAT HE WAS A HERO
New update coming date plz
So after almost 11 years, the heroes get a permanent household,that too a shared  accommodation... Tells us so much about the real-estate situation and rising cost of living eh?
Its funny that King Goblin mightl never be a thing
When is the TH17 update?
So if I start upgrading my AQ to level 91  before the update will I get a lvl 70 or 60 minion prince when the update drops?
I'm so happy, That from now on I need upgrade building to upgrade heroes 😭😭😭
So no Quality of life improvement? Legend and farming wars stay the same? sucks...
he looks hella trash
What lvl will i get for th13
judo will be a fantastic hero , just drop him in battle and he will strategize and improvise the whole attack for a triple
when is the update?
On the brighter side we can use the new hero from th 9 that's great right
Yo his ability is crazy
I only able to support you by entering creator code while purchasing with cwl medals.  Is it really supports you?, and I'm doing this long Judo.
Is it true that if we put heroes to upgrade, it will be automatically upgraded to the next level after this hero hall appears, I mean, after the update?
The statues in the hero hall kind of reminds me of assassins creed 2 when you unlock altair’s armor under the villa
Would be nice if they made it so hero upgrades don't require a builder since builder potion multiplier don't work for that they way it should 💀💀💀 Those who agree 👇
Well, I think I'll officially start getting nostalgic about COC, i really liked the alters. But i guess the banners are for the better. Gonna miss the old hero system😢
When is this coming live?
I’m so curious as to why they didn’t just put him at townhall 15, like every odd townhall previously, does that mean there will be a finite limit to the number of hero’s and if it was also because of the pets
I do not like this, why restrict the amount of heroes we can use
When is this update coming out ?
W vid ty for the info
Can supercell stop making things complicated for the old players
İt is good maybe i have judge it early thanks for peaks
So you only use 4 heroes hahw
14:48 you purposefully waited for the minion prince to turn away ☠️ Judo’s too good
I think the lavaloon epic equipment for the warden should be given to the minion prince
I think upcoming event got minion prince equipment event is correct , 😊
makes no sense to still require a building imo, should've been like the laboratory
Thank god they didn’t give us higher ths a lvl 1 prince 😂
1 doubt bro, at the same time my all heros kept update using 5 builder ASAP ? Is right
How does the upgrading works? Do they require builders or they are like the pet house where only one can be upgraded, or they don't require builders and multiple can be upgraded
This is the first time we’ve ever gotten a second troop of the minion family
if im a th14 with max level heroes, which level is my minion prince going to be
As an air troops strategy player Minion Prince is a very good combo for mass air attack with GW eternal tomb and BK, AQ will wipe out the remaining bases for finishing as well as funneling
We got Kirmada in CoC before gta6😂
No more Warden statue???
Thanks for sharing❤ Excited for TH 17, although I am still at TH 14 with all walls remaining to be upgraded😅  Just Realized: We will miss the hero upgrade animations😢
Mr. Josh, will the kings be returned to level 1 or if so will I leave the game?😢
Nobody gonna upgrade the king now💀
its going great for Clash of Clans but i miss the old game back in the days.
I am at th15. What minion prince level would i get?
Looks satanic
i think price minion will be good with dragon spam only and if i use price minion with lavaloon he will clear trash building rather than following ballon target right
I was stunt that the minion prince is already available in th9 instead of the archer queen and that’s quite a big change
It's nice seeing a non-human hero, makes the hero concept be wider and not only enclosed to humans
Wouldnt it be worth upgrading to a higher town hall level and then upgrading one of your currently max heroes right now? It'd mean you'd get a higher level minion prince.
so no more rush player😂😂😂
Less goo imma use this with Lalo and RL
Looks like we will get the Minion Prince at level 80, if we build the hero hall at TH17, is that incorrect?
Any idea when is th17 releasing?
No new pets?
Not being able to use all 5 hero’s at once is really dumb kinda disappointed
For a second it was looking like they were getting rid of upgrade times for the heroes... man.
Since there is a hero hall, it shouldn’t take a builder similar to the pet house
Will the flags being smaller put holes in bases
Hello judo..always watching your video..imfrom philippines..
Amazing video😊
Oh great they just made dragon attacks so much more easy with the prince🙄
They should have increased the base size rather than removing all the iconic buildings from the base. Being an old player i was inactive for a long time, but thinking that we wont have our eagle and alters makes me sad cos they were there with us for a long long time 😢
But why so many levels on Heroes instead of just 5 at each TH??
Another building to waste time lol
bro if now i have hero 72/90/60/40   i got new hero lv???
Tf?? I need justice this ain't fair only taking 4 heroes when you have 5 dude I mean I will delete this game once the update comes
It would be cool if you could save certain heroes and their equipment to certain armies
so no more warden statue?
I think we can unlock new hero in th 9
Where was the max capacity loot raid video in hammar jam?
When is the update?
Judo pls make a new best base for each town hall with the new, removed and replaced buildings
You get the queen at th8 now, you know how kinda broken that you can use queen walk on potentially Th5s I think (I forgot of clash’s matchmaking works as I haven’t played in 2 years)
Never using this dawg ass minion new gen this is so dumb why do i gotta upgrade this mf now too thats a joke
Goodbye altars 😢
he looked like RAYBURN JR.. in blue
İ dont think the hero Hall is good
They should apply the same research lab principle. With the hall the heros should go to "train" for a level up instead of a builder being used. Would help keep pace with a town hall a year schedule
Uhhh.. when will this be iomplemented? I'm at TH11 and like... nothing happened when i logged in? i am finding out abt this just from this vid...
Is new hero at max th 13 lvl in th 13?
I didn't like the hero hall
I kinda realized that the barbarian king and archer queen are the two first troops in the Elixir barracks (i still call them elixir barracks) and the minion are the first DARK Elixir troop. If im right, we can guess what is the second* new hero after the minion prince
They just complicating the game more
01:38 Judo walk when 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Wait what ?? Queen at TH 8?? Hmwahts happening here
Thinking of it now. I find it odd grand warden became a statue & we had alters then banners
I hate this th 17 update 💔🥲
Don't like update
wtf bro I hate this
I'm seeing using the prince and warden to  send super archer blimp in
This update is trash now I have to pay more to even get the button to upgrade my heroes with loot I have to give again
Hopefully we get a new best base for every townhall soon😊
Fun question! My town hall is upgrading to 14 currently but my heroes are very rushed. 21, 1, 10, and 5. Regardless of their levels, does the fact that I am upgrading my townhall mean that I will have the maxed version of the hero hall due to that being a requirement before the townhall can upgrade or will it be a lower level and cancel my upgrade?
So are they completely removing the pet house and equipment buildings?
Glad they adjusted depending on what TH you are
great more stuff to upgrade and waste time
This is slowly becoming like that one game i know
E drag spammers going crazy
so when is the update coming??
Who in supercell thought about creating Minion Prince as a new hero!!?
Buen día para todos que día sale la nueva actualización gracias
Coc is losing originality😔
Hii, please i need advice, I am currently upgrading my queen to level 91. She is my highest level hero. Will I get Hero Hall level 10 or 9? Is there a way for me to know?  Btw great videos Judo, keep it up? 😁
I hate it
im still waiting for the goblin king supercell
So what level dark minion will I get if I have a queen at level 90 and I'm Town Hall 16? I wo t get the lvl 70 prince because my queen isn't 95?
I feel like the only solution to this "not being able to use the hero while upgrading" without ruining their sales so much is just if your hero is on upgrading, every equipment will be on default. You can use them, but with default equipments as the catch. As even with heroes on, without the equipments, attacking is extremely difficult esp if you remember what happened back in TH15.
My th is 14 can I get minion prince if I get how many of the prince2
Really thought they would have stoped hero upgrading from using a builder smh
Judo pls told to supercell ores collecting is very difficulty 😢 so simple way to collect it
so still no goblin king? 😭
Bro If i am on TH14 then It is depended on My Heroes Level or Townhall I Have Archer Q.and Barb king of 66 Level and Royal Champ 25 and Warden 52😢 Then How much Upgraded Minon Prince i Can Get?
So if i am a th10, and my highest hero level is only level 10, will I get hero hall level 4 or hero hall level 1? And if I get hero hall level 1, does that mean it bypass the hero hall level requirement to get to the next th? Because in order to move to the next th, you need to upgrade the hero hall to the max for that specific th. So for a th10, the minimum hero hall required is level 3.
Should we therefore try to get to the highest town hall level before the update to get the most levels allowed by the hero hall?
I like the update, but it won’t be the same as placing your Barb king for the first time🥲
They are making archer queen at th8 instead of th9 now????
They're definitely going to nerf it's ability lol
I've seen nothing but hate for this. As someone who has been floating around 5400-5800 for a while now and usually get perfect CWL, I would consider myself a pretty good player. I personally really like this.
Time to nerf the MINION PRINCE😅😅😅
Will higher th result in higher level of minion prince?
Now i want pekka as a hero 😂
My heroes levels are 90, 61, 51, 14 in this case I've to upgrade my BK to level 91 to get the minion prince at level 70 ready for me right?
New hero, so new equipments sigh. 😂
i am confused that we have to upgrade the hero hall first to upgrade hero or we can upgrade hero directly in th lvl in which there is no hero unlocking like th 12,14,15,16
When the new update will happen ??
RIP Warden Statue
Ridiculous
we got Minion Prince before Goblin King 😔
Thanks for information about minion prince 😅❤❤
grand warden turning into statue while defending was unique, and i prefer that over a few defensive buffs that a mobile grand warden offers.
As long as we don't upgrade the room to the level of unlocking the champion, the heroes won't become unavailable to those who already have them, right?
It's all Bs
I hate the hero hall
Bro how can we play this version plz somebody tell us this
worst update ever . i miss altars and abiliti to use alll my heroes
The last troop I want as a hero is Minion. And these guys selected minion as their new hero, he doesn't look good at all.
At least I get to use the new hero instead of waiting to upgrade to th17. This looks to be an overall exciting update !!!
Hero hall Look more cool than th 7 😮
Nah, I don’t like it
I guess the clapping ladies only lived in the town hall why the heroes cant 😅
This man is a generational yapper
I get instead of level 1 to 90
I was so happy to figure out that the 3-by-3 alters would be changed to 2-by-2s (36 tiles -> 16 tiles)... until I realized the hero hall is a 5-by-5 and takes an extra 25 tiles
When new th coming
Iam not happy about the Hero mechanics.😢
Feel like attacking is going to be really hard again, not looking forward to it. They pretty much ruined hybrid with all these new multi target defenses. TH15 v2.
When i told other players to rush they told me it was a bad idea.  🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would argue that the warden on defense is actually weaker now, because as a troop, the warden statue will have everything that the opponent put down drawn to the warden, similar to the other heroes and clan castle instead of the opponents troops targeting something like an elixir storage while the statue is fighting whatever is destroying the storage off.
So I need both Elixer and DE to upgrade my heroes now😑
Do I get the max level on the Minion Prince if I upgrade from th 14 bto 15 before the update?
We don't want this new idiot defense nor do we want Town Hall 17, all this is rubbish, we only want our eagle artery. 😏
1:32 TH 18's new leaked hero: JudoSloth
When is the update
What about builders?will heroes upgrade still need builder
I’m in town hall 10 and there’s no update. I didn’t get anything. How do I update Clash of Clans so I could get the minion prince
now we can have as many heroes as pets🤩 its a fine addition
Edrags are gonna evil laugh after this news😂
When the upgrade will come in play store 😅
Ngl imma miss the old hero altars. Been here since the game first dropped, and I remember when BK n AQ were first introduced. The original altars. Its been a joirney, and Ill never forget ❤️
@judo in lieu of CWL and not having a book of building or hammer, will my war base be weakend by not having access to the eagle artillery while my th is upgrading or will it somehow work like the other merged defenses while merging will not have a wait time on your war base?
1:32 Judoslot
Hello bro when the town hall is max after update hero hall also max because before upgrade the hero hall after town hall tell me bro one more think new hero max 90 level when the our townhall is max after which level comes. My townhall now max how to come new hero starting level or 70 level tell me my dought bro
This is a mental change for heroes, but still - i need a potion that allows usage while upgrading)
Just to be clear I'm a new th16 with Iv90 heroes. If I upgrade a hero to Iv 91 (such as the archer queen), will that change anything considering I am above the TH15 hero limit? Shouldn’t I get the th 16 builder hall and th 15 minion prince?
Air sweeper never gets a goddamn update no matter how many new th level comes😂😂
The hero hall is interesting. I do think the old "Get 10k D. Elixir through attacks for the king, then 40k to unlock the extremely powerful queen" was a really solid and strong gameplay cycle for Town Halls 7 to 9. The queen cost nerfs that came after were fine but I'm worried that this is disrupting that cycle too much. We'll have to wait and see.  I think having to upgrade the hero hall to see the new hero levels is not particularly good, imo. I think getting a taste of those high level heroes at the start of a town hall is the type of push you really need to get going for a new town hall. It also just softens the impact of having to learn how to attack harder bases.  The prince's design is not to my taste, but I do think they did a good job overall. Feels very 'Clash of Clans' but in an alt timeline where the Goblin King was the 3rd hero instead of the Warden, way back when all those theories were floating around. I personally probably won't use him unless I am specifically doing air attacks.   Not looking forward to see if and how I have to fix my base when the hero altars disappear but oh well, I do think this system is ultimately better (even if the altars were really iconic. Maybe they could be added as a decoration reward if you max a hero or something?) The loss of the warden statue is a massive shame, though. I thought that was really unique and cool, especially fitting for Town Hall 11's unique aesthetic and vibe.  Overall I am happy though.
When a hero is upgrading, can I use the hero?
Any one want to th 16 max id
It's good to have minion hero at th9
update tomorrow right?
I literally can't be arsed by learning new troops new tactics and defences. It's taken years and years (9, going on 10) to get as far as I am right now, only for it to just change again so that it's almost a new game. I'm done. No more money from me.
When is the new Update coming out? and Thank God I'm TH 13 maxed so I can still use 4 heroes...
POV u played in 2024. “Do you remember when hero’s had alters?”
Question: (that is if you see this) Are we able to use heroes to while they’re upgrading? Or are we still unable to use them during upgrades?
RIP grand warden statue. you will be remembered just like re-armed traps and multiple Baracks
So, for clarification, if I were to have maxed heroes for th14 and the possibility to upgrade to th15 before the release and upgrade 1 hero 1 more level… I’d get the minion prince maxed for th14 and not th13? Cause that seems like it might be worth it?
Please sombody tell me when is the update
They could have name those 2 minions "Mega Minion"  They named this very stupidly
So can you only upgrade to town hall 17 when all heroes are maxed or almost maxed
Hero hall sucks if you have 4 heros or less
wait so th17 drops tomorrow?
When will be the update available for asian server??
so the grand warden is two heroes. grand warden air mode and grand warden ground mode
Rip to the grand wardens defense statue.    :(
Can you upgrade heroes while the hero Hall is upgrading? I don't like the 15.5 day wait for the upgrade but if I can upgrade the minion prince while the building upgrades, then I won't use any magic items to speed up the upgrade.
That's so many information for my coc experience in the toilet
Bro there is nor update of CoC.
One more hussle for us f2p players, also blacksmith and hero hall could've been merged together
When does the update come out?
So I might be misunderstanding this but are you telling me that we have to re-upgrade our heroes again from level 1
Dont update the game im almost maxed! 😩
hello
helllo
Im actually glad you get the minion prince earlier, i was thinking i was gonna have to wait till im town hall 17
Since we have additional hero, some of us want to know how it looks on the profile view which all of you creator failed to show. Is it still show 4 hero or it will display all? And what will be the bg and etc. Since you are the most detailed reviewer for whatever update on clash of clans I was hoping yours will be different.
Update release date?
Supercell: What if we combine fireball and frozen arrow? Might be a new ability!!
I thought he was very handsome. I want his white skin to come, it will be more handsome.  I just think that heroes having this absurd amount of levels is unnecessary, they should be reduced
Im almost max th15. Does this mean i should rush to a lvl 91 hero, so that ill get a higher lvl minion prince?
this is the best update in the history of clash.
Hero altars😢
Archer queen at TH 8 😭
When is th17 coming out
Rip and aww man
Is there a time or date when the TH 17 update will be released?
I think Clash of clann has been nerfed 🥲 now i can't see my queen roaming here and there
attacking is already PAINFUL as a townhall 10/11 because of how overpowered the bases you're going against are compared to you, only being able to use 2 heroes at townhall 10 is gonna ruin the experience by a TON for me.
Now we need an updated best bases video
You know deep down in my heart, all I want since I was in highschool was Goblin King 😂
when is this update coming
I just maxed my Queen on th9 🥲🥲🥲
Hi. Can you finally save your heroes, pets, equipments and CC troops with your army? That would be so convenient🙂
My wall is level 16 now , from level 12 , Thanks Hammer Jam ❤
Sadly my new hero will be in lv1🥲
Why do I feel like they are gonna add a hero every other TH now
I will love this game if hero hall hero will upgrade like troops. Why hero needs to upgrade using builder?
My grand warden and royale champion is on th14 max level but my archer queen and king is th13 max level. Do I get new hero in th14 max level or th13 ??
Dark elixir troops,spells, 3 heroes, pets,monolith now another hero which requires dark elixir for upgrade, honestly they should add another elixir or ingredient for hero upgrades, it's way too hard to upgrade all these things considering how hard is it too farm dark elixir compared to gold and elixir
When is this TH coming out?
Its nice that the minion prince to lvl 70, but equipment for me is still a huge problem since I'm still way behind on equipment for all my heroes.
I am th13 so would it be beneficial for me to upgrade to th14 to have a higher prince hero level?
Real clash of clans going to start 🔥
When is the update??
So should we upgrade town hall before new hero comes so that we can get higher level of hero ?  Like For lower town hall like 12 should upgrade to 13 ?
What if you are an og whith all heros
Watching from Bangladesh 🇧🇩💖
I don't really like the fact that you can't use all 5 heroes at once...
The spitfire looks like roaster
Something like a mighty dragon as a hero in th 10 should be introduced in future.
Why are the altars gone its so stupid , devs always coming up w some dumb shi
Can we upgrade multiple heroes at the same time in the hero hall?
We need our beloved eagle artillery we want eagle artillery back
So they just added a nuisance for lower town halls, but it's good i think
Thanks for all your sneak peek videos. Great info as always.
whene is the update?
Omg this is the best thing happened to clash and it happened so late 🙂🥲😂
do we know the day of the update?
Bro I have 4 slot and 3 hero. But this update I have one slot and I upgraded the hero hall and I unlocked the 4th hero😅
I wonder how the King and Queen have slept together and produced Minion Prince 🤔 Something is fishy!!😂
JUDO PLEASE HAVE A TH17  BASE LAYOUT AND MY LIFE IS YOUR
This New Hero looks like a satanic character
I dont have hero hall
Jadon bouta be so hyped not having to use the queen
Why we can,t get 5 heros
When is this update coming ?
I think the super archer is stronger than this new hero 😂
Opps
Is it me or do I feel like the hero hall  Animation and 3D seem so similar to Dota’s hero animation and 3D art style
So I’m townhall 11, does this mean I’m losing a hero for attacks and defence? That’s dumb
Very cool, good idea, good innovation
Hero hall anti rush?
I logged on, no update, when does it drop?
Will it take builders to upgrade the heroes like old since they have introduced heroes hall ??
SOO if my th is 13 if i upgrade my th to 14 then i will get more leveled up minnion king ?
Insane
Can anyone predict when the update is going to come? I can’t wait!
Massive
I am deff using the new hero  My ugly ahh boy is deff a great addition to air attacks, and those are the main type of attacks i do
so will you be able to use heroes while upgrading?
I just entered  th 9 and now the queen archer is available on th 8....
Not to sure how I feel about this hero hall building. I do not like the idea of needing to upgrade ANOTHER building before you can upgrade heroes.  But excited for the new hero and update!
Rip king
How can you name this as a new Hero if he can't do anything independently? I think this is a very bad choice of new hero who can't even defend himself from air mines 😅
I’m confused I’m a town hall 13 am I gonna lose my heroes or is my hero hall gonna start off upgraded to the max level for my specific town hall?
12:24  Don't forget lavaloon puppets
Judo u should drop some new th17 bases when it comes out
I don't even play this game anymore, just came here to listen to Judo
Looks like they've left themselves plenty of room to add more new heroes in the future, which is cool, I'm excited to play with them, but less excited to upgrade them 😅
Such a w move to give us the new hero based on how much our current hero’s are leveled its gets better with each sneak peak
My king is currently level 90 and its upgrading to 91 rn,when the update drops it will be level 91(because the update will autocomplete it.
Wow, now you instantly unlock the Barbarian King?! Legends remember the grind for that first 10k Dark Elixir
Coc ❤
When does this update come?
The stats of the dark ore should be weaker otherwise it‘s statwise competing too good with the frozen arrow which is still an epic equipment
This is honestly a great quality change, as i can now upgrade a hero while still having a 4th hero.
When I first saw the pic of the new hero being maxed at lvl 90, I was dreading upgrading 90 hero levels. I thought it's be like RC and have a lower max level. I'm so glad they are scaling the levels to your town hall level.
not even clash of clans anymore
When is this update releasing
Rip altars  This game is changing so fast
What about  we have max hero we have gone do we have to start again
RIP rush players!🕊
We're expecting to be the Goblin King WAY before But it seems villains can't be the heroes of our village all this time.  But my boy Minion Prince is already goated.
When will the update drop ?
What if I still want the hero alters
I mean a new hero is cool but the rest just feels unnecessary in my oppinion. Having unlocked 3 Heros but only using 2 just idk feels really incomplete. Plus we get a new building to upgrade ass well and with the space becoming more and more limited a new building is not the ideal way. they could have implemented all this in the troops menu but whatever...
Judo will my other heros be automatically upgraded to minimum for my th?
They just slowed down rushing lmao
When the  update is coming for all player's??
I'm at the very end of TH12 and even though I go to TH13 now, I'll be getting a TH11 Private Investigator🥲
When is it coming
There is nothing we can do..
Ngl😔 i feel like the old Coc is soo much better than the new one(its just my opinion )
Why the minion prince looks like Muslim
Okay. So this is confusing. I’m almost maxed TH12 (4 more Barb King levels remaining). Should I go to TH13 before the update so that I’ll get the maxed TH12 minion prince or will it match my other hero levels if I stay at TH12?
When th 17 update will come ?? Tomorrow  ?
Soo is it good it upgrade townhall now soo that i can skip that many levels of minion prince upgrade?
when we can see THE TH17 !!??
A quality of life inprovement will be heroes not requiring builder to be upgraded just like pet house and lab
Do we know when the update is scheduled?
an update that finally urged me to install the game again
Anyone else notice how the bodyguard minions had a housing space? Maybe we are getting them as a troop too?
I was so happy thinking that hero upgrades will not any builders untill Judo reads my mind and tells that the builder still will be used 🥲
Just as I max my th12 for hammer jam 💀
I unlock the Prince minnion.
when is the update coming out?
Iam so glad i experinced peak clash of clans before 2019 and alk this. Literally 2016 was peak
So its better to get the hero hall on max heroes so you can get the new hero max already?
More timers for heros woooooo😢
Can we only upgrade one hero at a time now? 😭 RIP lower town halls
Everyone was so worried about the queen being unlocked at level 8, but the developers had something very different in their minds. So glad now players can choose between the queen and king. This makes lower level townhall gmaeplay so interesting. This is indeed the best upgrade.
When is the update judo?
Im opposed to this it destroys the nostalgia that made the game amazing so many years after release
All these sneak peaks is always making me think the update came out
But what will happen of we already have max heroes
What happens if you have an hero before the update
This hero hall thing is stupid😑
Does the Archer Queen's Frozen Arrow freezing stack with the Minion Prince's Dark Orb? Will we have 0.65*0.5 slowness effect on buildings?
Worst update ever man 😞. I mean the spell was a disaster but then I saw  next sneak peak and its even worse.
I’m waiting for the day we can use the hero as they are upgrading. I was excited when I saw the hero hall. Hopefully one day. Town hall 20 maybe 😂
Hell boy Skin Would be looking great
Great video judo ! I have a question though, if you can help me.  I’m nearly max th14 (I just have traps left) . My question is, if I upgrade to th15 today using a book of building, will I get a max th15 dark prince? Thanks 🙏
If I missed the lavaloon puppet will there be a way to get it in the future?
nice
When update please
Judo this game is getting is so complicated i hate complication 😥
sir moose buta lose it 😂
7:02 the minion prince icon looks like a hero, but still the royal champion looks like a sore thumb and out of place 😢
I am using ground troops for attacks, should i use minion prince?
This reminds me of castle clash lmfao
This update is the best update they’ve brought out in a while
Supercell had make this update due to the fact that massive chunk of plager do wars with hereos down. This will help massively.
I don't like the hero hall the old way is better tbh Its just More Elixir Requirement on top of the Requirements for the heroes  But the already leveled Minion hero is quite nice
Y si tengo th 12 como es ?
In which townhall will the Minion prince is unlocked?
New troops removed please  please
Gl defending , the meta was already soo ez , after this , just swap rc or king withthis and easy air spam to victory .Nice balancing Coc
When will this update will be added in the game
Queen at th8? Utter woke nonsense
Basically the hero hall works like a pet house right 👍
I don’t rush bases and am ftp by the time I get this there will be th20 prob or more
When the update start?
lv 90??
Good to know, I’m gonna try and use hammer jam to make sure Atleast on of my heroes is at or close to max lvl so the minion prince is as high lvl as I possible
I think they should combine the pet house and the blacksmith
Last time i played coc townhall 10 was the max
Love from 😊❤ Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩 please tell me, town hall 17 Confrom update date?
Hope this means WAY more new heroes.   Also, this game is now VERY similar to castle clash lol
Not impressive new hero😢😅😅
Pls Show us wich heroes you are choose with your dragon strategy
When is this update coming out?
Judo, my AQ and bk are lvl 31 and 32 (th10) as a th12, is it always basedon the aq? Will i de-unlock the warden? Or am I just stupid and it's based on the grand warden
We only can use 4 heros then why new hero its totally suck 😂😂😂😂
1:34 Judo level 50, Ability Time travel, breaking clash of clans, Infinite money
So can we use hammer of heroes to upgrade hero hall?
Ok so for air attacks at mid game e.g th 11-13 I think dark orb is gonna be clutch as hell for inferno towers, the amount of 2 stars I get just because of them is mad 😭
Can you please do an updated base layout video asap with all the new buildings coming?
When17 update come😅
judo sloth is just the best coc creator
thank goodness you only set archer queen to defending, now your walls will be ok :)
I find it annoying that the clash team instead of just making the map bigger and giving more battle time depending on your league are just taking away building and making other buildings smaller
Wait i have a question? Does it mean i cant  upgrade my hero from the mean time until i upgrade the hero hall the same as the townhall? Since my hero lvl currently in the high lvl
still need a builder to level up the heroes 😓😓😓😓
so we won't see the heros sleeping animation anymore?
Brother i have doubt will they discount in level system of king queen 😅?
Do you think the Minion Prince will work with th 12 Lalo? ALL the heroes have some utility , maybe it will be better at th 13 replacing the RC with the Minion Prince
When we r getting the update? Tomorrow?
stupid update ngl
3:14 question.If im already th 9 and i have archer queen unlocked,will my hero hall be the max lsvel of th8?
When is this update coming out?
Really nice to see some good changes done by supercell. Could we get any info regarding when TH17 Might release?
Is there any changes to legend league and donations?
Is there another one sneak peek 🧐
This town hall 17 looks like broken building every time I watch it and looks wise very bad
This thing looks ugly asf and I won‘t accept it as a new hero! They should‘ve kept it at three! No more no less!
When is the update coming?
If we are higher will we automatically unlock the new hero?
When is the update going to drop?
Lame .....we should be able to switch from sir and ground with the new hero
I love this update❤❤❤
Hero hall was a bit disappointing   I expected a bit of aid to upgrading the heros But well
One of the reasons why I support judo every time i purchase a Gold pass is he’s not greedy as others. He always says “You can support a creator by using their code” rather than saying “Use my code before purchasing anything” 🫡
A guide video on the minion prince would be much appreciated.
Gonna miss the alters 😣😣😣😣
Is the update coming tomorrow?
I really don't like this
Now now, more time to wait to upgrade heroes AND TH
When will this update drop and what happened to the daily chests and snacks I do not have them anymore?
I still think the minion print should be a Townhall 17 feature where you unlock him at that level
YES!! I can finally get rid of the queen!
When will the update gets released  ?
This is amazing since now you can switch heroes while another is being upgraded, WHAT AN AMAZING UPDATE ❤️
I hate the hero design
W vid
What would the prince level be at max th13 ?
Minion prince max lv 90. Take long time to upgrade 😢
Shout out to jungle heat haha
Honestly they should have added a new mortar on th17 and let the geared up mortar merge with th. That would be the best option
Hero hall is not a good idea tbh
Aaaah yes, the Minion Furry
By far, I'm seeing the new hero being nerfed in the future
I was right new hero and name also is right told minion prince.  So good to see my prediction is right
What happens to the hero hall if you are currently upgrading you townhall
When update???
I hope hero isnt too strong and just swaps with another hero
The equipment level should have been 15 atleast for th 16..  Already exhausted upgrading so many equipments😕
This is a super sick update and I’m so glad the minion prince isn’t unlocked at town hall 17
honestly i think minion prince is just a replaceable royal champion for helping an air attack unit
Hello Judo, when is this update?
So what was the point calling him detective i thought he will get called  detective or something
As a guy who prefers to use only air spam I will love minion prince
So can we use heroes while upgrading them ?
When is the release date?
add hindi audio in your video
So thats why this clan games as a dark elixir rune🤔
They do nothing but make things complicated 😂
Finally i can upgrade heroes without losing 1, this made my day thank u ,judo
Now i request to you make two video 1st for base for every th n 2nd for army for every th (must needed) and help me i am losing interest in coc but i want a max th acc 😢
I just hope ores will be more abundant… right now for me starry ore at TH15 would take many months to be able to get epic equipment above level 23… (just one)… 😭
Where is this supercell store, of which you speak?
Old players when they see this 💀
I don't know if I am not going to like this update😣
Hi Judo I have a question do u know how I can unlock my clash of clans account I contacted support and they didn’t help me
Supercell should make the orb go towards townhall at all times so it will be a lot more predictable and useful.
Goofy ahh looking minion king 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Love you from india😁
I dont like that u have to max another hero with dark elexir, it should be normal elexir.
Henchmen puppet looks good
So should I use the minion Prince with blizz lalo?
so when is the update releasing?!
I expected more tbh
What time, the update will relase?
I love how you explained everything with great detail. Also, I really applaud SC for the work they've done, putting everything related to heroes, including pets and equipment in one place. That must've been a lot work.
Lower th are gonna be a little bit difficult from next update  Excited ❤❤
Happiness of DARK ORB  But saddness of Loosing Eagle artilery 😢
Will the hero hall start at level one even if I'm in town hall 13? Or will it be like the max level it can be in that townhall?
WHEN IS THE UPDATE BEING LAUNCHED????
i really don't like how upgrading heroes requires a builder even tho we got a "labratory" for them , it doesn't make sense
should i upgrade (book) my th now from 14 to lvl 15 to get the minion prince higher level and dont have to upgrade it by myself when the update comes even if im not maxed out th14 rn but my king queen and warden are maxed already ?
Im guessing TH17 drops tomorrow since Hammer jam ends tomorrow???
i only thought that minion prince will be available at th 15 but th 9 is crazy
If the hero hall is an unplaced item can I make my Archer queen (get it to lvl 95) and then place it so I get a lvl 70 minion prince?
Why they don't rip off the black smith and pet house?
I didn't get any update what should i do
Such a dumb unoriginal looking hero
mobile legend Fighter＝Barbarian King Marksman＝Archer  Queen Support＝Grand Warden Assassin＝Royal Champion Mage＝Minion Prince
Farewell Upgrading animations !!:(
Boooooo, we should be able to run in with all 5 heroes
Judo. Would you rush up a TH lvl (th13) before the update to get the extra lvls on the MP? All major Def and all walls are completed thanks to HJ. Please let me know your thoughts
the alters were such a great part of the heros, i will miss them
Wait is judo going to make another base video with the flags instead of the altars?
I wish we had been given the skills of the new hero at level 9 at least, I'm dry with minerals to walk around with another pair of abilities.
that aint minion prince thts mini satan😭
Again we need to upgrade our troops
NO PETS?
When do these changes take place?
Yayay
Gotta love the update
Wtf is this 💀
Something im realizing about a 5th hero is what’s gonna happen to the hero skins, making 5 whole skins for the heroes every month is not an easy task and clearly it shows as the champion hasn’t gotten a skin the last two months, I have no clue what their plan is, if it’s gonna cost more or something, gonna miss having the whole hero sets but we will see what they end up doing, overall tho th 17 is gonna be so amazing
I have a doubt. Does the freeze effect of the Dark Orb of the Minion Prince stacks with the Freezing Arrows of the Archer Queen
What ?  So in the next update I can't upgrade all hero at once 😢 It will take more time to max all heroes
Gotta be honest I’m not super psyched about Satan being the new “hero”
So update still isn't tomorrow......... thanks SC for dragging this out even longer
Nice so with my under leveled heroes who always use potions for war I now have a low level hero hall with potentially not even 4 slots of heroes to bring to war 😂
Eagel😢
So if I were th16 but my heroes are still th15 level (max 85) , what level of hall of heroes (minion prince) do I get ??
So does it mean we wont get the th boosted heroes immediately once we  upgraded the townhall?
Still uses a builder bruhhhhhhhhhh
2:50 the big changes sucks😅😅
oh now when u are up a hero u can just use the other ones cuz u have 1 extra that's nice
I totally called how the hero hall will work!
When is this update releasing...
Yea smart let’s make it even harder to upgrade the thing that was already the hardest to upgrade the dev team is in a terrible place right now just adding the first thing that pops up in they’re head not thinking logically sometimes it seems like they don’t even play the game and understand how it works I don’t understand why they would make the hero unlock/upgrade system into this
I’m so happy that all players have 1 more hero than they can use. Now you can level 1 hero at a time unaffected.
Hero hall just keeps getting larger lmao made me laugh
We hope wall dont need builder to upgrade😢😢
Awesomeeee❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Update data?
Does that mean of im Not th16 Max but one of my Heroes is lvl 91 he is lvl 70 and if Not online the step below?
I don’t like this update
That’s stupid af. Games keeps going downhill
The hero hall feels so forced, I don't like it
Probably new TH will be released after CWL, right?
Just what expected Quick Train UI♡♡♡
Minion Prince fits the "That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow" meme
5 heroes but in game you  will have 4 heroes only ?
It means no more warden defending as useless stone 👍
Does anyone know when the new hero will be introduced in the game?
😂Rushers are still getting rinsed by gamers and CoC  creators😝
Supercell should have changed the skin as he looks like a giant minion
I predict, that one day, hero upgrades in the Hero Hall will no longer cost you builders
Who seen minion prince before the update on forest only can like this comment👇
In which town hall minion prince unlocks
how do you even get the prince?
Hero hall seems kinda pointless. It just adds even more days to an already crazy grind.
1:40 obviously Judo sloth is our hero 🗣🗣🔥🔥
When does the update go live ?
I unlocked Archer Queen at TH 9 😢 and Dark Elixir is very hard to obtain. Sweet old memories 😌
Such a stupid looking hero when everyone wants a Goblin King
Headhunter see grand warden no statue, headhunter happy
Goated editor
Isn't the minion king a little bit too broken? That's in my opinion.
Theres no update yet?
Why they still need builder
That's why we love coc devs, so cool that they levelled up minion prince. Also great update for lower ths.
is there any time for upgrading heros? are just leveling up with required elixirs???
This is not good at all firstly now i have 5 heros to upgrade not only that i need builders for it like it would take so long just to hit max this is way way way too bad bruh at this point just let go that 5th hero and leave it untouched
When is the update coming out?
they need to make a new farming strategy to catch up on hero items...cuz i took a 6 months break and now i feel so behind
I have a lvl 71 king, 80 queen, 30 Rc, and warden at 55. What would the level of my Minion P when the update drops ?
Well That's a huge downgrade for the BK
Honestly, they made this townhall way too easy. Th15 was way too hard and now th17 is way too easy. Tbh, th16 was the perfect balance in between the 2.  That being said, I think I'll stay at th16 this time.
Im hope clash of clans update anime skin hero
Do bring a video on base links on every th as several things will be changing since you posted the last one.
Is this update tomorrow?
When is the update
I don't like the face of this hero 😢 why suppercell is going through a phase of making bad looking characters first the apprentice builder then Goblin builder and now this
When is the update coming though??
No more equipment for the old hero’s ?
Guys I have queen lvl 74 what MP lvl will I get? And do I have to level her up to 75 before the update
Dark orb looks too op for mass air attack
🤩🤩🤩
hell no
So you are telling me I don’t need to upgrade my hero’s if I don’t have them Max
Judo i just went to th 14 so basicly my heroes r maxed out rn for th 13. If i upgrade one of them will i get a highrer level hero hall it would be a big help if u let me know thanks
This game is starting to look more and more like castle clash
i not like this is a bad thing we want all heroes who is
Minion prince sounds more heroic than private investigator.
We all are sad about the eagle artillery to be removed 😞 no defence can have the aura of eagle artillery
So this means hero levels will stay or will they change?
This game is slowly getting bad
Thank you, I was expecting that the new hero will unlock at townhall 17 nice move by supercell..👍🏻
pro tip. don't upgrade the minion equipment until the new ones come out.
When we will get th17?
wait, so if I am a max TH14 will I get the new hero at the max level of my townhall or at the first level of that TH?
when will this update come out?
Man im going to miss the warden statue and the hero altars, theyve been here for a long time unchanged.
I don’t like this D:
The minion's price roaming around the base.
Really enjoying this news with the heroes. Hopefully they add more heroes
Im not sure I like the editing on your newer vids. I dont want to be offensive but it feels like its over edited af
becoming as same as the flop games with similar concepts
The Minion Prince is disappointing enough, now we have 2 hero equipments to get to lvl 18
Im  sure everyone gonna hate the fact that hero hall has to be upgraded to actually upgrade ur heroes
Does that mean we can have more heroes added now? Awesome! Can't wait for other heroes from the cancelled clashvers spinoffs
I like that it starts from a nice level but they should do that with the equipment to it is really hard to level it all in my opinion and another hero just doesn’t help
with this new hero and new troops, will you be making a new attack strategy video?
Ok so I feel they’re reserving this building for weaponry later on, it’s so big tho. However, Dragon armies will come alive with this hero. I love it!
Then they will give us the hero at the level of the previous one we have but I suppose that with the hero hall it will be the same because if not we would only have one space.
Wow, I am a returning player to clash after years, and all of this stuff is so alien to me. Is there a video that explains all of these hero pets, and the new abilities etc...
I'm TH12 almost 13 should I upgrade to 13 before the update to have the minion prince a higher level?
I have a doubt on heroes leveling system  If my king lvl is 10 for TH16 but having max queen  What it will my minion prince level ?? For TH17 upgrade??😅
I wanna ask about something, if now I'm at TH15 but my heros are really low level (about Q71, K40, W30,RC15) did I will get my minion prince level based on my TH level or to my heros level ?! if it's about my TH ..So i will upgrade my town hall before the update
Minion Prince Seriously 😒 supercell😂😂 I think they are running out of Ideas to Make new Hero's what's next Healer Sergeant
When is the update rolling for global?
Too much information to take in for a game I play in a toilet 😢
Do we not get the alters as decorations???
The real question now is; in the new update, do the heroes sleep when they are upgrading or they still can't be used in wars and attacks?
I dont understand.. so we cant upgrade 2 heroes at same times??
Why is this update not there in my base
I wanna use all my heroes
Why would we need a builder to upgrade a living being? Why won't they make it work like the laboratory or the pet house?
Im not a fan of this you can only use 4 heroes for defense . It defeats the point of unlocking the new hero
Now devil in clash of clans its satan why coc did this.
2:51 hilarious😂😂
I love these sneak peeks judo. Keep it up. When will the th17 update actually release?
peakk🔥🔥🔥
For me i think there a lot underwhelming defences such as the ricochet  canon that only bounces to 1 unlike the multi archer tower that targets 3 unit and now they cut the number of heroes defending your base from 4 to 2 then whats the point of having a 5th hero
Minion prince❌️. Private investigator✅️
Can we take 5 heroes?
Jaydon will love this (not chosing te Archer queen) 🎉🎉🎉
What the heck my hero level is 47 king and queen it means we are going back town halll ☠️
Goblin king yet waits another year..
Lets goo we are getting hero at th9
8:46  So it means, troops that target defence buildings can't target the Warden right now??
Having queen at level 8 is going to change game forever. And having a new hero at th9 also
I think he good and not bad
Its a bad joke bro.  Sepercell Directly using "baphomet" sign. Its a Satanic symbol.
I’m crying 🤡
Th 18 must have demerging townhall option, like you can demerge previous merged defencens after th 17  Likethis time we had eagle artillery, next time in th 18 we might get another merged building but you xan also have option to switch it to have old style weaponised townhall witheagle artillery
Rip statue
1:37 how select judo sloth 😹😹
Dont worry most of it will be nerfed before 2024 ends.
Is this update out?
They cooked with this update
When will update drop?
Judo no un Lock 17 plz😢
they should allow all 5 heroes on defense..
Why do the minion henchmen have 10 housing space stated  Are they gonna be a new troop soon?
yea me maxing my queen paid off
Im actually disappointed. Was really hoping for him to be switchable between air and ground. I'm not an air attacker. I guess I'll have to find a way to make it work. Most likely only use him when upgrading another hero.
Wtf why using a Builder????
I'm glad the defending heroes have been made stronger by making the flags smaller and easier to fit in important spots  just wish the warden statue still remained, i really liked the aesthetic 😢
So... unfortunately they will still require builders
When you upgrade a hero in the hero hall does it require a  builder?
more like pet house instead of laboratory because you unlock heroes by upgrading it just the same as pets
do i get lvl 10 hero hall if my queen is lvl 93, and others are lower levels?
weird that the equipment doesnt automatically level up at least to some degree, when the blacksmith first came out all equipment was almost max level instantly, I dont see why a lvl 70 prince wouldnt get at least level 10 equipment immediately.....
I honestly think that the hero hall was not needed. It was just another thing Clash said to we can spend our dark elixir elsewhere. It was just a thing they wanted to update. If anything they should’ve made the king available at th 6 to balance some more things out. I can see why they want only a certain amount of heroes per battle, but I the end of the day it’s us who are playing the game and not Clash.
bro i got th 11 and still no minion prince
7:46 town hall 17 walls
so can they defend and attack at the same time?
So if I am max th11 with lvl 50 king and queen and lvl 20 warden will I get instant lvl 50 minion prince
When is the update coming?
I am going hate that hero for his appearance
But wont we have to use more resources now to upgrade the hero hall BEfore being able to upgrade our heroes?
Does this mean hero upgrade doesn't need builder and we can use them in war while its still in upgrade 🤔???????
They really made the minion into hero😭😭
Bruh I hate hero hall unlock hero in old time don't require time to open them
At this point just make the map bigger It's going to be less complicated than those building combinations
This is aweful a creature in hero army what the hell coc doing... This game was better until th 15
When is update released?
Judo can i ask a question if lets say am th 12 and my heros are low lvl and i get the hero hall do my heros (barbarian king,archer queen,grand warden) get instantly leveled up because am th 12 the hero hall may lvl up doe to the needs of uprading it to advance to the next th?. Thank you
What is the max level of the minion prince for every Town Hall level ?
Hope my journey will also end up being a supercell content creator ❤️
1:32 I want to select the judooro
A big L, I thought it will be 5 heroes every attack
quick question, at 7:46 when you upgrade barb king, it show upgrade time to every hero, idk if ui and dev build thing, but because it show that, does it mean you can upgrade 1 hero at the times? i just need clarify it
is it likeeee everyyyyy buildinggg even walls are supposed to upgraded to there maximum level to get the minon prince at level 70?
My RC is max only other are at 50😅
They should remove builder use for hero upgrade like pets if they are making a separate building
This update will likely be the reason I finally quit the game.
But what about, during this time we can three star any base with just destroying the hero altars w/o even knocking out the heroes, so is it even possible to get three stars w/o knocking out the heroes but taking down the hero hall?
i honestly dont like this update, i will have to re-design my base to fill the space the smaller hero pedestals leave and all the levels i put in my rc will go to waste. I liked the old system much better and i would have rather had a 5th hero rather than 4 hero’s you can choose between.
I'm going to quit COC after hammer jam
Excelente 🤩🔥
Well I’m very glad they have added a 5th hero and made a hero system where you can take 4 into battle and 4 onto defense, so now we can upgrade a hero without being severely handicapped in war attacks😊
Unnecessary update
I personally feel like Minion Lord sounds a lot cooler, Minion Prince kind of under sells him.
Are the hero upgraded max is 1 hero? if yes, then this update would be trash. i mean before update, we can upgrade all of the hero if the builder already and now we can only upgrade 1 each upgrades hero
When is the update
haha omg I said it yesterday.. it's just been stolen and modernized again.. it's literally the new version of the champion chamber from Backyard Monsters from back then.. you could only use 1 "hero" and the other two were frozen in the chamber.. GG supercell developing their own ideas is probably too exhausting
hold up thats actually amazing u can unlock queen at th 8 now lol
On what date the update drops??
At least he will be level 20 instead of 1
আমার ধোনের আপডেট
When's the update coming by the way????
When the update start?
👍
Wait so is the update out or is he using the developer build
I should have gotten the rocket spear instead of spiky ball
New hero is looking good ! ❤
Not too happy I have another hero to upgrade but at least it’s not from level 1
I don't like the minion prince😒 There is no need for this hero.
If the hero hall wasnt a required upgrade before upgrading your TH, it would be really broken  Just rush to th 16 or 17 and then build the hero hall to get maxed champs basicaly
When the update?
Minion prince isn't replacing anyone 🤡
Bruhh supercell finally made a laboratory sort for heroes which players were begging since long but why the fck is builder still required. It would have been rather ok if it was like laboratory with 1 or 2 possible concurrent upgrade instead.
Awesome vid judo ! So with all the new buildings and merges should we expect an updated war/farming base video?
GOOD BYE KING🥲🥺😂😂😂😂
Bye bye Archer Queen :)
The downside you lost 2 heroes to defend your base
This is so stupid ngl
When does this release?
WERE GETTING A NEW HERO???
New hero looks like satan 😅
personally, i would really like to see more content for lower townhalls
Hi I love your videos and basically watched every video of your's in a month
I was exciting to use the new hero but, i can't  update because i don't have enough space after update only ifeel the update
I like that the minion prince is available relatively early into the game, so that way this update is relevant for normies
Town hall 17 Hero 💩💩💩💩💩
When is update coming
I can't believe I've to lose Eagle artillery 🥲🥲🥲🥲. Who else gonna miss Eagle artillery 🥺. It's unexpected from supercell 🫥.
I think this is not interesting for too many players like as me😢  Please don’t update that To save downfall of supercell coc😢😢
I like how the bases are shrinking little by little with all these merging
Alright but now imagine how strong the Minion King is💀💀
Minion Prince's face😂😂😂
Minion prince looks more like a villan then a hero
Twon Hall 17 bat💩💩💩💩💩
Bro missed leg day
I hope they add way more heroes then before since you can choose between them now
clash of clans is getting too much dude.
I think that I have seen the slots and heros mechanic somewhere 🤔🤔
But how does this work... because the herohall needs to be upgraded so you can use more heroes. But lets say your a th13( like me) can you then only use 1 hero in the begin... i dont rlly get it
only hero i have maxed out is RC so will it still upgrade the new hero to lvl 70?
The update is amazing, but I was expecting something related to ores that would make them easier to get😢
1:38 when did judo became a Hero 😝
You can actualy see the new defense in the background of the attack
Judo! I’m still sleeping man!
I have literally just maxed out all of my buildings in the 9. And I would be moving on to the next th tomorrow and this showed up
Ooo them leveling up the minion for us is extremely helpful and nice and convenient tbh that’s really good
Walls again are going to be pointless 😂😂
My personal opinion. I didn't like this idea. When i saw this here Minion prince as hero, i got excited that now we have 5 hero's to go for a attack. It would be awesome if they just added this minion prince as 5th hero with 5th slot n not to always switch a hero as we will have only 4 slots of hero's to go for an attack.
Question: my town hall is lv16 but low level do I keep my heroes and the slots? Also I will upgrade my heroes 1 by 1 could take awhile but first the prince then barbarian king then the rest
My town hall upgradeing to level 14 funny thing is it finishes at the town hall update
Supercell add broken attack concept and erase the most important defense, player still  be able to get 3 stars with fire ball and root spell, now without eagle player have no worry of it and much easier to attack.
I think they should increase the amount of ores and dark elixir
Can you please release a new best bases for every th video for the new changes
How we can try this update as you do ?
Please make new base with the hero’s and the new buildings judo.. THANK YOU
this is a great update, make sure everyone uses code judo in the shop! <3
As expected...........the "Secret Investigator"
So we should rush one hero as high as we can get them to get a higher builder hall right? Like a lvl 85+ queen with my current 75 king to get hall 9
if archer queen on level 94, what will be minion prince level?
I hate thrower troops, dajjal troops is very bad.
if we had 5 slots it would've been better
So rush your base now, before the update drops to get a nicely lvled new hero 😂
The game is ruined damn you
Basically restricting players to use magic items or wait for building to upgrade to unlock heroes which used to be instant which wastes hero boost. It would have been better if they just removed the builder requirement for hero for upgrading just like pets.
so im th14 if i would upgrade my town hall to 15 would i get a higher lvl minion prince?
It turns out the detective is Minion Prince.
I have a question!!! If i am Th16 maxed... will i unlock the hero hall at lvl 10 or lvl 1?
mid update like always
Nah not being able to use every hero just doesent make sense to me
Will we get a new “best bases for each town hall” ?
Really not a fan of making the equipment level 1 for all players on release. Equipment is already such a bottleneck for players and this will just make it so people aren’t using the minion prince for months because not only is he lower level, we now have to invest ores into all his abilities.
Will the update supposed to be tomorrow?
How will the profile cards of the players now look like when there is a fifth hero?
I'm just going to be a th15 before the hammer Jam , so would I get a minion prince of th14 max level while I place the hero hall
I think that is a comeback to the max lvl hero account where judo maxed all 4 heros for around 5K (still some of my favourite videos)
Im th 14 almost maxed i have all my heroes maxed and in like a week i would have ugraded to th 15... Should i upgrade it before the new update so that both the hero hall and the new hero would get a bigger upgrade? (I know i would have to upgrade 1 level of one of my heroes too in order to do so)
What about t people how are th9 already
Prince of skipping leg days
So town hall 15 now needs to updrade 50 levels to max out the heroes and then what everr for the pets to max TH15? Thats bonkers!
The hero slot is foolishness judo(using 1 hero at TH8) , I hope they change that fr, but everything else is gold 😅
Bro got espanol ddub now⁉️
His dark orb is insane dayum 😭
should i rush to th14 then cos of the hero hall?
The editing of your videos is always so great !
Honestly huge, the only thing I don’t like is that the equipments will start at lvl 1 no matter what th you are
i guess they should remove or will remove the blacksmith and pets buildings for more space since everything can be done in the hall
Minion prince kinda look boring,i expected a better hero,btw can I use 3 heroes in th 12?
I think they should add Merged mortars  Which would have the huge range of eagle but a quarter or half the damage of eagle  They will get activated once a certain percentage of damage have been done
Bro why does it still use a builder does what does the builder do to the heros in the hero hall
at this point, there s no point in upgrading your defenses with all the additions to the offense
another rush-base player nerf,..... good
Oh wow
how about upgrading heroes it can upgrade heroes simultaneously or 1 hero per upgrade?
AAAAAAAAHHAAAAHAHHAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!
Bye bye hero alters 😢 and how darw the devs disrespect the king 😅
To many heroes to upgrade.
Can I use heroes when upgrading
Hi
Hero hall becoming the new most important building. Also like the fact that we unlock the minion hero early so lower town hall players are able to play with him.
Dumbest update ive ever seen me and my 6 accounts are logging off for good
With how I don't upgrade heroes, he might as well be level 1
New players upgrading all the heroes from scratch 😔 OMG what a pain😢
well i guess we are back to th15 Clash of air🤦🏽‍♂️
you forgot to tell us if we can use the heroes while upgrading
Isn’t the car sound at 10:10 from Friday the 13th the game?
The good thing about this update is that I can use my max amount of heroes whilst still upgrading another one in the background
JUDO my heroes are all a couple of levels off of max for 14 but I went up to 15 during hammer jam. Would it be worth it for me to use books/hammers to get one of them into th15 range to get extra levels on the prince? Or did I misunderstand how that works
Finally we will get somemore heros excited for the future
Minion Prince or the equipments are soon going to be nerfed...😂
Wait so at town hall 8 we can get the archer queen????   Correct me if I am wrong 😊
Tomorrow th17 🎉
So if I'm a th12 with max defenses and walls, but lvl 50 heros, should I upgrade to th13 so that I get the lvl 50 prince vs lvl 40? Or am I looking at that chart wrong?
So even more steps to upgrade heroes when comunity just keeps complaining that upgrading them sucks
Worst update we have 5 heros but we can use only 4!!!!! i mean really????🤮
Wait, will minion prince fly during defense? If so, can any of ground melee troops hit him?
They actually cooked in this update, people have been asking for a way to take their heros into battle while upgrading them for _years,_ and they actually implemented a pretty clever solution to this problem.
20 levels of minion prince that will be challenging even for max player with gold pass
Guys so we can get minion prince on th17 ?
now we definitely need the "BEST BASES" video
The henchmen puppet seems to be pretty useless😂, the other one is insanely good
what will happen to account with rushed TH? like they have low lvl heroes and they have th14? will the heroes get levelled up?
When is the new update?? I can't wait.. 😂
when will the update come out?
Hope supercell don't use builder when upgrading hero like pet 😊😊😊
Judo Sloth will be our 6th hero .
Welp guess I'm not using archer queen unless i use the giant arrow
So just castle clash but more boring.
can we place the hero hall instantly at level 10 as a maxed out th16? or does it need a builder and takes time to construct?
Minion prince asking his henchmen to wear clothes meanwhile he is naked 😂
I love the idea of a hero hall and another hero. Now you dont have to worry about running with a weaker army
Can you please make another video about updated every TH layout because of the new updates
That makes no sense as the heroes aren’t alters any more they’re not buildings their flags. It should just be like when you’re upgrading your pets.
should i upgrade townhall before the update to get the benefit of higher minion level? i would only skip 3 hero upgrades and 2 cannon upgrades
I still want the Goblin King...
Supercell runs out of ideas I guess. What is this ugly creature ? I wish a Pekka King or Valkyrie Queen as a new hero not a minion. They will add Goblin King next ?????
Let's be honest this hero is the ugliest thing we've ever seen 😅
Noooo why not gobling king :(
So the new minion prince is suitable only for air attacks, which I find it really stupid.😏
So you need builder and resources to upgrade the building that can upgrade heros????? And you still need other builder and resources to upgrade hero lvl??? OMG please don't 🙏
So here me out if your close to th 16 it’s worth just jumping the gun to get those extra auto levels on the minion king then
Im excited for more upcoming heroes 🔥
What happens if your Townhall 14 do I have to start all over from heroes
I have level 80 king and queen and 51 level warden and 18 levels of champion  what will be the level of my minion king ?
I am thankful for the auto level upgrade but THEY SHOULD TOTALLY GIVE IT TO THE EQUIPMENT AS WELL!!! They did it when equipment was first added, Idk what is stopping them from doing it, yes maybe they feel like they dont know to what extent they should upgrade it, but I feel like level 9 or 12 would be a good bet
Wow!
Fantastic video as always Judo! 🦥  It's a pleasure to finish lunch and enjoy 20 minutes of golden and very well structured CoC contents, best paired with a coffee! ☕️  Too bad these sneak peeks happens only every update, because now we have to wait for TH18 😂🥲  Can't wait ti try out the shining new Minion Prince! Have a fantastic day my friend!
When is the update?
I just upgraded to th13 and looks like the minion prince will be replacing the royal champion right away👀
I have a doubt I am th 16 max queen max royal champion max grandwarden max but king level only 92 . Can I get minion prince level 70?
Does this mean we cant iphrade multiple heroes at a time ?
Im gonna miss the eagle artillery but update is an update
quick question, im max th14, with AQ lvl 80 and just started TH upgrade. Will my minion prince be higher if I finish my th before the upgrade?
The fact supercell is providing the minnion prince early i awesome ❤
Are we can use our hero even tho they are on upragding?
When will it come to game
Electro dragon attacks at its peak 📈🗿
This update IS trash because of The hero hall
Not Judo fat shaming the hero hall for half the video 💀💀💀
This is so cool and incredibly smart. Absolutely fantastic thinking and exucution by supercell
Minion prince looks like J cole
1:11 did he mewing😂
Why is it looking at us like that 💀
Don't forget to like 🎉
Does this mean we can expect update tomorrow?
TOWN  HALL  17 UPDATE  DATE
So now we are getting a lab for heroes 💀
having more heroes than you can take into battle is a great fix for the hero upgrading issue as you are placed at less of a disadvantage when upgrading one hero
Woo kno the hero you known 😬🥳
For a moment i thought hero upgrade would not require a builder 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
I PREDICTED THIS YESTERDAY
You try to explain too much it become a mess lol
bro this new hero system is TRASH 💀
Hello Judo do you know when is the update day? So I can plan my hero upgrade. I currently have AQ at 75. but if I get her to 76 I can save 10 levels of Minion Prince. Just wanted to know the update day so I would know if I'll be able to complete it before it starts
Rip eagle artillery  Bro th 16 is more powerful than th 17
When th is releasing Anyone ?
Been waiting for this whole day thanks judo❤
14:47  to destroy an enemy one must destroy him financially, an ability well used i must say
Man i came to this channel after a long time, lot of things have changed, most importantly Judo look Handsome🔥
if your upgrading the heroes you still cant use them or they changed it to be like the laboratory?
I was about to hit town hall 11. So I have to upgrade the minnion prince from 1 to 40 ?
Hero slots is a terrible idea
Upgrading hero’s shouldn’t use up a builder slot imo
Why on earth does it still use a builder if they’re being upgraded in the hero hall similar to the laboratory???
OK, I'll admit, the hero hall is actually a fun update. I like it.
Getting bored with this game nowadays
I am not feeling good or happy because the game is like a village before and simple and interesting, but the updates make the game a complicated and hard which I really disliked . What did you guys thinks????
Question 🙋‍♂️ if the troops live at the army camps, the pets live in the pet house, and now hero’s live in the hero hall; who lives in the town hall? Why is that the most important building for the second star? 🫤 🤔
Will we have last sneak peek tomorrow?
Judo can u max my th🥲
I just maxed Th 13 today and upgraded to th 14 will the hero level be for Th 14 max or Th 13 max?
So we can’t use all the hero’s anymore?
i have a thought... I have a level 27 royal champion at th 16 (yeah I'm rushed) and i think level 30 rc is the max for th 14. So in theory, if i upgraded my royal champion to level 31 before upgrading to th 17, the hero hall required for level 31 rc will be the th15 hero hall, which means my minion prince will be unlocked at the level of th 14 hero hall. in short upgrading my rc to level 31 will give me a th 14 max minion prince instead of a th 13 max minion prince. Am I right, or it will be the average of all my hero levels?
Why does it take builders?? Would be better if it wouldn't...
❌ Minion Prince 🤴 ✅ Giga Minion 🗿
Huh, they still want a 4 hero into battle
so we don't need worker to level up hero?
The blacksmith’s building is now useless
Clash of clans is becoming a disaster
I swear your editing style humor is just perfect 😂
I saw the trailer and said it’s going to be eagle artillery town hall! I saw with the way it was designed look very similar to capital peak town hall.
Big L shouldn’t have to choose between heros
Rushed players getting Max TH12 Prince just because they have a level 1 RC
I'll be glad if they made heroes available for defence and attack even if they are upgrading. Woudl be great especially for wars
If I’m being honest the builder hall seems pointless if it doesn’t act like the pet house and make heroes still require a builder you should be able to upgrade one in the builder hall and any extra would then require a builder but I guess that’s too much to ask for
💀💀💀 i just upgraded my townhall 15 today
Im townhall 13 does.. It mean i lose my archer queen royal champion and grand warden and new hero
Want layouts with these new buildings
Rushed accounts just became so much more expensive to make 😂
I wish they made Minion Prince upgradable with Normal Elixir , it could be a good lore that a Normal Minion got Super Strong After consuming normal Elixir !
As an edrag spam rusher this is an absolute win
Love how you explain everything so good that everyone can understand🙏
Everything is changed and that game is changed now nothing fun everyupdate is now changing game completely
You can use heroes in war while upgrading?
Does upgrading a hero still disable them on attacking??
Next hero would be Wizard warrier 😜😜😜
im currently upgrading my blacksmith and it needs 1 d 6 h and if update drops tomorrow at 9 am my time that's less than upgrade time what happens?
When is the update dropping?
Can you upgrade one and leave it out? Or are u forced to keep it in your rotation?
Supercell recruited some Chinese brains for clash of clans. Some of these people were behind the creation of game "WHITE OUT SURVIVAL". And guess what every passing day Clash of Clans are becoming just like that. The idea of Hero hall and other cosmetic changes are from that game. I play both these games so I could spot these. 😅
but the update will be out tomorrow as the hammer jam ends or during next week?
The minion hero can be unlocked  at town hill 9 ?
What happened in th 12 ?is it already leveled up?😅
yep, the meta is shaking now 🤣
I really hope they massively reduce hero upgrade timers and costs. Otherwise this will be painful...
He looks...smug.
I'm just curious: What's the prince level for th 13
w clash of clans
Unlike the release of grand warden and royal champion. This hero is extremely boring. They had a good chance of making the electro titans a hero back in th15 days. But they missed it.
Thank you so much for information bro.😃
13:18 why do the henchmen have a housing space? we already have the thrower as a troop so its weird
I am not sure if a non-human hero was a good idea.
Can we take judo to battel 😂 as a hero  So he can teach queen to how to attack defence instead of breaking walls 😂
And now they hide Heros lvls behind a new Paywall, you must upgrade a Hero Nuilding to get lvl for the Hero it self crazy, more and more is going behind more and more grind, Like the Hero Items
Minion prince looking like Kratos
This game has changed A LOTT. Sometimes it feels good, but then the nostalgia hits 😢❤
I wish there was an option to get th17 without getting rid of the Eagle Artillery (no weapon in townhall but still the same design...)
Difficult for lower lvl th
What is the level for th15 😢
Judo I in th 14 I can use five hero in attack ?????
lol
Wait. If i have th 15 but my King is 72 and my warden is level 48 than what level of hero hall will i get? 😰
When does the update come out?
Was hoping for a squirrel pet 😆
1:33 TH32 JUDO HERO😁
If they are making a separate buulding for heroes, then they should merge pethouse and blacksmith init also.
The abilities would be soo helpful in defending the village since the power creep is too high in the attacking aspect. Hero abilities usable during defences would be amazingg.
So minion price at th15 would be what level to be precise?
What if my AQ is lvl 92? Will i still get lvl 70 minion prince?
Air only hero is lame.
This is worst idea
Damn , hopefully we will get a New Best Bases for Each Townhall Video now !
So if I rush to max th rn, I would be saving on leveling the prince?
13:16 why does it have housing space if we cant train it?
What level is he gonna be for town 14
Devil hero😂😂😂
It would be great if they showcased customizable hero skins in the Hero Hall in the next update.❤
New hero is useless except his 1 ability of freezing
One day hopefully we will see the shield maiden from clash mini come back 😔
Aww "still uses a builder.." bummer. exciting update!
i hate this update
The private investigator had such a smug expression lol
judo now we need new attack strategys and bases for every townhall
Question, Im a town hall 10, and both king and queen is already lvl 40 how will that work? will they just get downgraded or...? im confused
What happened to the human based heroes
Nooo I just spent all my money on upgrading walls
I just upgraded to th16, does that mean I get a lvl 70 minion hero? Or should I upgrade one of my heroes to lvl 91 (so higher than max th15 allows) before the update to ensure this?
Will you make an updated th base designs cause of the new building and the new hero system ?
Queen and Minion prince charge/walk together with druids? This will be op for me
If you have to ask for money using a code, You dont need the money. Give those to whom dont ask
Best update ever🤩
Welp who's ready to resign the base you stole from the best bases video cause i sure am!
What about Date of update ?
so if im th 14, my minion prince would be at the max level if would be at th 13 when it comes next update?
Shouldn't they reduce hero upgrade time? or at least make them usable for battle while upgrading? Cuz these days getting resources isn't so hard, so upgrading all heroes at once isn't really hard to do to save time.... That's why they should make them usable while upgrading at least
herohall is a joke.. I was waiting to upgrade th17. But It will give lower hero hall based on my lower hero level
What is the level of minion Prince at th15 ??
I'm th 16 with my archer queen level 60 Whats the level of the hero hall I'm receiving? Its really bad bro I wanted to go to th 17 directly
Clash a rama is now outdated beyond comprehension due to hero hall nooooooooo
bruh this update sucks
When upgrade hero replace with minions hero is possible plz reply
queen , my highest hero, is upgrading 80 to 81 so anyone can help me what lv hero hall i get ??? pls
I still can't accept that we are getting a hero that is a minion prince rather than a human hero similar to the others, he's design is way off than the design of the others. But he's abilities is cool though
Iam th14 and My warden is lvl 50 (th13 max) if i start upgrading him and th17 arrives before my warden is 51 then what will be the lvl of my hero hall ?
I would have preferred a giant coliseum instead of this sort of tavern for the hero house
So far this is the best sneak peak that will make me play the coc more consistently. The before two sneak peaks were not that good enough btw
I’m about to be a max th12 with only needing 3 more levels for my grand warden. Does that mean the minion prince will delay me going to th13 as I have to upgrade it a little bit?
Don’t like the hall, just more upgrades for no reason
Poor barb king is going to see so little play from this update
thats crazy... hero skills and more heroe choices thats crazy
Will there be no new pets and levels? Also ig 2 more common equipments will come for MP.
the hero hall is a horrible update in my opinion
But I'm a TH 10 and how is the transition gonna work?
New hero is op 🎉
Nah the hero is shi
After update air army is going to be insane😂
When is the Update???
india wale like karo
So now you need to spend more days to upgrade hero hall in addition to the hero upgrade.
Does the update come out tomorrow?
Too bad it starts at level 70, defeats the purpose of the fun journey to max. They make it too easy.
When will be th17 realising?
its nice, but i think the lower th's are going to be a grind and if we got 2 hero's in th8, then i feel like it should be 2 slots (if not then archer queen should be th9 as always )
Ok all the update is good asf but the thing I dont like is how u need the hero hall in specific level to upgrade to the next townhall.. Maybe this is their way to reduce rush bases? Maybe 🤔🤔
I want to select hero judo😅😅😅
I wonder  if this will effect electro dragon attacks in positif way or negative way
When did this update coming out
When's the update coming?
When is the update dropping though?
well last time the hero equipment were almost max lvl when we got the equipments so dont know why not now
minion prince gives sukuna vibes
So they just gonna make this game more of a headache nice
Trash hero tbh i was expecting something more creative
Can you tell me judo are you gonna do a video with the town hall 17
The concept of the hero hall is very good but I don't like the flags. This means you can't see your hero skins in your base. Gotta go into the hall to see them, that's pretty unfortunate imo
While objectively a good change from a game design perspective, I do think we lose the cool feeling of placing down a Hero altar now. Small price to pay I suppose, lets just hope this means Heroes can finally be used while they're upgrading, although I doubt it
Good, very good, i think this this all is a fantastic huge update but.... Why a minion hero, I don't know how you can connect a character like this to COC and maybe a story was just needed, an introduction that would allow us to understand more about the reason for this choice... And the maga minion ability maybe need of mote minions, no? (this is just my opinion)
So can we use our hero while uploading?
I am a TH16 and my max level hero is lv87 does that mean i will only get hero hall for TH15?
I was hoping they'd remove the upgrade time for heroes
❤❤😂🎉
When does it come out?
I do hate how I won't really be able to use the minion prince as I have no ores atm, lvl 1 equipment is a joke
No melee hero?
Honestly just watch this and last 2 sneak peek, kinda little annoyed that most of the gold pass perks is not active on th17
we get th17 before gta6 is wild😂😂
Then  what's the use of the Blacksmith & Pet House? Just remove them and connect the levels to Hero hall, then we can save more space. ( Dont forget to refund what we spent to build them )
I have maxed out all the hero's expect for the king , which is at level 73 at TH 16. Will i get level 70 minion prince at Th 17 ?
When will th17 arrive ? Date plz
:)
Can we now when the update is coming?
I'm glad we're getting the new hero at lower th levels
Tye clash is getting worse per update
The editor is soo funny😂
Guys with th7 and th8 rush it to th10 before the update to get the heroes with higher level
Awesome video. Extremely detailed. Thanks again for putting together this video. I’m super pumped about finally having a new Hero. This looks better than I had hoped. I can’t wait to try it out.
Well he seem cool 🧊
I don't know why these edits are so funny, but I CANNOT avoid laughing just at all of your videos. Just go on and thanks to cutter(s)❤❤❤.
I believe, I am not going to use the new hero forever
Personally I liked the Grand Warden statue..
the minion rprince looks pretty cool but the henchemen puppet seems soooo useless tbh
I remember being excited getting the archer queen at TH9 when that was the max level. Now we have 5 heros and almost double the town hall levels. There is kinda too much of everything nowadays
this is actually such a W update
Th 17 release date
LET THE HEROES USE THEIR ABILITIES WHILE THEY DEFEND THE VILLAGE PLEASSE
This just makes the game more clunky and confusing.
Dark orb is like mini frozen arrow
babe wake up we got new flying hero in the game.
I'm still TH14 but almost have everything maxed, do I just update to th15 so I get a higher level prince?
First non-human hero
So when i keep both heros on attack and defence,will the health bar go down while the hero is on defence when I am taking it for attacking
Here me out folks.. the Minion prince will get nerf soon hahaha n the slow time reduction will below 13sec cz 18 sec is to long for slowing the building shots
My suggestion hero's upgrade without builder like laboratory
I wonder how long before they nerf the minions equipment after we maxed it out.😆
crazy to see coc getting a lot well thought out updates, while CR is just more oil been poured onto a dumpsterfire
Bruuuh I don't know if I wanna still play this game or not. 4 heroes were more then enough. What is the point of not having the hero altar. They are not a troupe to have their own barack.
Amazing!!! You are doing awesome content!!! Keep this up🔥
Thank god I don’t need to have him sleep for the next 2 years
You think update will be after season?
BRO THIS UPDATE IS GARBAGE
Like my comment 🎉
If overnight I rush to level 16 town hall will my minion prince will be 70 even if I have level 1 other heroes ?
Can anyone tell me in which date these updates will be released in coc?😢😢 I need to upgrade th 13 before this
Trash
I think I need insurance and lawyer before upgrading to TH17..
when will this update come
My warden statue :(
So, when the updates come?
What if im in town hall 13
Thank goodness maxed players are going to be maxed
Hello Judo, hope you're doing well. Can you upload a video on best bases for every townhall because with the upgrade there will be some changes
𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐛𝐞 𝐭𝐡 𝟏𝟕+
what was the builder hero alter then in the season sneak peak?
You have editor ? Or you will editing your videos?
I don't understand. Is this a tutorial or what 😭 like tutorials always gotta be boring but you make them fun to watch 🫶
Oh Man that's complicated
Since the hero hall max level is 10 and I’m a max th 16 do you think there’s a way I can upgrade my town hall before placing it down and get a higher level minion prince?
Good hero reving for dragon attack at th10
When is rhe update coming
Yo judo im a town hall 12, almost town hall 13 but i still have to upg the troops and some buildings and if i upg to town hall 13 will the minion prince be a max lvl town hall 12 hero?
Never get tired of watching ur video bro ❤
When will the update drop?
Mang Judo, kasih tau Supercell klu desain TH 17 terlihat gepeng, coba diubah lagi biar ga keliatan gepeng. Makasih mang.
A lot of information to digest.
Give him some pants brooo he's a prince😮
Spammer e drag belike 😘 🤣🤣🤣🤣
as a town hall 11, this is good 👍👍👍👍
I really like that clash of clans are now planning for the future with these updates and making sure the game can always keep going without getting overwhelming.
Someone needs to really make supercell reward us with more ore. Now we have more epic equipment to upgrade…
I just reached TH16 but my Highest hero is AQ at lvl 85. What Lvl of Minion Prince will i get?
2nd time i asking this judo, does "destroying eagle artillery" achievements won't get any progress if we upgrade to th17?
So what are we thinking when the update will drop?
Can we use our hero while upgrading or not ?
I m in india and the update has not reached me yet
Love all this 🫶💚🥰 thanks judo 👊
I must upgrade my Hero Hall to level 11 in order to upgrade my Heroes (King, Queen, RC or others) to max level or can i do it with Hero hall level 10? @Judo Sloth Gaming
Flop Update Ever
😔😔  heros are dead
Judo has mastered the art if talking bollox.
Who ever read this message is ................... Gonna unlock th 17 soon❤
Why tf we need builders to upgrade heroes? Do they need beating instead of training?
When will this update release any idea?
Why does the minion prints look sleepy
When is the update dropping I can’t wait I maxed out my th16 finally
The new hero system was pretty much what I’ve been predicting  Can’t wait to play!
So I should upgrade to higher th before the update comes out to skip some minion prince levels?
What a horrible update . Considering deleting the game now
Th17 release date...!?
i almost got excited, but nothing changed, i was expecting something like be able to use the heroes while they were upgrading, or didn't need to waste a builder to upgrade a hero, so, we only got a new building that didn't change anything and we are not even able to use all the heroes at the same time
rip hero altar
By the way when is this update?
No change to ores? What a disappointment!
Judo I think we need new th bases don't you think 🤔
In next th there will be a new king😅 Judo sloth Pekka
This game is getting more interesting day by day  Loved this update anyway
So when are we getting this update ?
So I guess it's worth it now if you are close to max for a th level to quickly upgrade th and one hero ASAP
When is it coming out.
It's not good ,we need to use 5 hero's for every attack
Now we need new video on best base design at every townhall and best attack strategy for every townhall level😅 And please also make a video on best equipment and use of minion king anyway great video❤
RIP Hero altars 2013-2024 🙏🙏
Feels like just yesterday i was commenting how I wasnt a fan of TH16 but now the TH17 aesthetic is perfect for me, cant wait to play tomorrow, code Judo will be used😂😂
On my newest account I have king at 30 and queen at 27, should I upgrade king to 31 just to have one more hero hall level?
Is there going to be a new best bases video at th17?
When they will release new update
The "big changes" troll got me rolling 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nice update
This is so cool, now we can basically always have one hero on upgrade without, you know, losing a hero out of 4.
What happened to low lvl hero on town hall rusher?? Th16 with lvl10 grand warden?
A hero must need real character but this looks like cartoon characters😢
Grand warden looks like he's been lacking good sleep 😂
so how long are each hero hall upgrades ?
Damn new hero new me
When is the uppdate
Thanks for information
😅 I thought there will be no need of builders for hero upgrade no way nahh
I have a question  If someone has already upgraded a hero to level 30 in Town Hall 9 before this update, will the level be removed until He/She do not upgrades required Hero Hall level when the update arrives? Please let me know,Sir
This just killed my hype for the new update
In my pov, this update is excellent, the only problem i see is maybe making 3 starring bases even easier, hope i’m wrong with this
getting rid of eagle will certainly spice up the gameplay after so many years of it exising but man will i miss it  such an iconic defense I kinda wish they picked another building :(
i think we need a new best attack and best base videos for every town hall
You might want to make a new video about attacking strategies without each heroes. Because 1 heroes would be idle and i would like to upgrade that while its doing nothing. Cant wait for your video 🎉
Town hall 17 when ? Tomorrow or what
In my opinion it was better if we could use all 5 heroes, also better for the game (more hype...)
This is huge
Why is the minion prince kinda... 🥵
The only L about the hero hall is the upgrading part, that’s so frustrating to wait x days to upgrade heroes especially cause a lot of people are gonna have max DE on update day
If i have maxed queen lv 95 warden lv 70 king lv 65 rc lv 25 will i still get lv 70 minion primce?
Rip rushed basses lol
of got me on the buiders 😐
Yo srsly
Soooo whats lvl of minion king would be at th15 and will we get the upgraded version of hero hall as well?🤔
so we cannot upgrade 2 heroes at one time
any idea when this update release?
BROKEN GAMEEE
I thought minion king
Wait, so I'm already a maxed TH15 moving to a TH16 soon what lvl would  the hero hall be for me?😅
i love this update so muchhhhhh❤
The real crime js not making hero upgrades behave like pet upgrades, in my opinion, like it just makes so much more sense to me like that.
Are their any pets on th17 ? Please reply
Judo, a question, would it be worth it for me to upgrade to th14 with a book/hammer right now since im almost a max 13, then once the update rolls out, i can get the hero hall at the th14 level. If my understanding is correct, i would get the minion prince as a max th13 level instead of a max th12 level(if i didnt upgrade)
When is the city base landing?17
nahhh i was going through this so excited they were gonna get rid of builders and make our heroes like pets but they just added extra steps and more things to upgrade   L change
it’s bad 🥴
I still have a doubt. What levels will the minion prince be allotted. As I am on Th 13 and upgrading from lv 1 will take years.
😑
I don't get what the level of the minion prince we get is. Is it connected to the current town hall level or current hero levels? Also, what if I start a town hall upgrade before the update (for example, from 15 to 16)? Do I get it from the level it's supposed to be at 16 or at 15?
Why are there 4 hero banners instead of 5 hero banners. Dont reply me with that 4/5 heroes in match thing cuz i know that. im asking in our base only 4 banners not 5 for all 5 heroes
@judoSloth this is massive update for us😂
What is its range of basic attack
Wait so when i log into my account (I am a TH14) will the hero hall be level 1, or will it be determined on my TH level or my hero levels?
This hero hall is going to be a pain to upgrade this will slow me down by a lot 💀
It's 2×2 hero platform
Judo ... im a new th 16, but i have already maxed my queen and my warden ... which level do i get the minion prince?
I hate this new thing you have to spend more elixir to spend the same amount of elixir this is so annoying
Does he also get a league skin?
Judo new th base for every town hall??
When we expect the Th-17 update,
.. I would rather have the older version😢 and i also wonder where  the grand warden will become stone😂
Really happy minion prince isn’t locked to TH 17 so the majority of the player base can play with him. Really good move by supercell
Well slowly COC is becoming more anti-rush 😂
I have th14 now, if I upgrade it to 15, then can I get minion prince maxed at th15?
6:00 so is it smart to upgrade my townhall to 15 from 14 before the update and get a higher level minion prince? Or did I understand it wrong🫠
No time for sleep now 😴
I have questions on the hero hall! If a hero has a skin on, is the skin lost forever or it is still there when you unlock it? And is the levels of the hero still kept? Are the hero abilities still kept? I have fireball on my warden. Is it lost forever and i need to buy it again?
Is it mean that heroes dont need A builder to upgrade Heroes?
I have my queen at 75, warden at 63, king at 51 and rc at 18 on th 16 ( semi-maxed ) can anyone please tell me that of which level of minion hero I am going to receive ??
Lvl 70 requires only a user to be on th16 or fully max out like i am fully maxed out 15 if i hammer the th to 16 will i get the prince of worth lvl 70 ?
Air only hero is deal breaket
I thought the HeroHalll would be a laboratory version for heroes. For the new hero Minion Prince why not use gold to upgrade him.?  But I like this new hero since I always use air attacks. I only use gobowitch and yetis for ground
that's so good when it let you pick just 4 of 5 heros because if you can use 5 heros it will be soo broken
This will be sweet for upgrading heroes because you can upgrade one hero at a time and be at full attack power so we’ll be able to do wars and CWL while upgrading one of our heroes
Minion prince look like pot of greed lol
I feel like they should have given more thoughts on his equipment... Like the dark orb feels like frozen arrow+giant arrow without the dmg, and im sure once other equipment comes out nobody will use the puppet one too..
When will come the update?
Rushed players are very happy 🤣🤣🤣
I want to take all my heros clash of clans be tripping
I wish the hall worked like pet house or lab and didnt need a builder.
good old time minimax
So if my queen is 80  What lvl I ll get? 60?
Dead update
When will be the update
So, should I upgrade the town hall before the update so I can get the most out of the levels?
Dear Judo, Could you make a new "Best bases" video because there is a lot of changes to buildings. Thanks!
The clash of clans is changing big maybe in the future it will not look the same anymore
WHO LET BRO COOOK OMGGG
One problem what if you have rushed heros? Will the prince be as leveled as the highest hero level? Or the rushed one cuz i have rushed queen and king but my warden is max
What the hell is supercell doing???
So, i guess the sneak peak was all that, and when will the actual update comes
Best coc player❤
so if i am a th13 do i get a level 1 hero hut or??
But Why we still need Builder to Upgrade Heroes?😑
Everyone praising this hero update is Th16 max or what? Having to upgrade your heroes to max in order to upgrade to the next town hall is just crazy, since equipment update I just upgrade my heroes when I get a book, I’m almost th16 max with th14 max heroes……
I find it very confusing because I always max my heros for my th and to upgrade something befor upgrading heros is just more confusing to me bit what do ju think judo?
Castle Clash Vibes Unlocked xD
this is so cool. I can finally have one hero upgrading and still have a 4 hero attack, huge for wars
i tried quitting COC after launch of Builder Base, the again tried after they split Builder Base, Now I wont Try, I AM Quitting COC, Thanks Supercell for Shitty Updates no one wanted
I can upgrade my one hero, but still can use all 4 of them
judo I have an important question for you, what if I am th12 and then I have 3 heroes unlocked and then when the update is released, can't I use all the heroes until my hero hall is upgraded to the max level according to my th? will that happen to us?
As a 9 we are cooked for this one
The thing i liked the most is that lower ths are also getting new stuff
Mr. Worldwide minion
I absolutely love the redesign of the altars, less footprint and the flag just makes it more visually appealing
I love judo when he explain thats why i subscribe long time ago
so does this mean i can't watch them sleep anymore when i upgrade them? darn now i will never see my Halaand skin ball kicking animation anymore
COC IS RUINED 😔😭😔
On which TH does the minion prince unlock?
Bro im almost done upgrading to th10 so what level will he be for me
The main question @JudoSloth is WHEN IS THE UPDATE????
7:55 "bear in mind upgrading a hero still uses a builder" Come on, my poor builders are already overworked, give them a break!
Nice,😁
Neat
Hi judo nice video as always, one question i am th15 almost maxed so what lvl will my minion prince be? I didnt understand completely. <3
Judo you are going to struggle in th 1 to 17 video 😢😢😢😢😅😅
Can you use your Heroes while they are upgrading...like the unlimited heroe event?
Supercell: We ran out of space soon so lets cut their altars
Damn insane value to get minion prince at that level already as a max th
They missed the opportunity to name the new hero Horde Lord???
only sad thing is that for low town halls this will be hard becz of the less amt of heros u use
Are we getting an update at 26th nov ??
Petition for Judo bieng the next hero with the ability to buy the opponents base
He is kirmada👿
Thanks for 371 Subscribers
GUYS WHY THERE ARE ONLY 4 BANNERS NOT 5 BANNERS ? I MEAN 5 FOR ALL 5 HEROES
Question: if you have Heroes upgrading during this time, will they auto finish or continue when you place the Hero Hall?
Sigh… more buttons to click to upgrade heroes.. meh.
Disappointed with the update
15:53 why did not the TH exploded?
5:35 🤔 so does that mean i will have my maxed grand warden of townhall 13 in Townhall 14 as i didn't maxed him on thn 13?
Ok, first of all, a great video explanation by Judo. Earned a sub... Now as far as the update is concerned, regarding heroes, it's very good but quite complex to understand at first. Yes, I will get the gist of it but it is still very difficult to get a grip of at first.  Also on a side note, by the way, the things are going, I feel like there would be heavy monetization by the Clash team regarding the heroes.
When the th 17 come?
Love you juddo it's my dream to meet you 😞 but it's not possible 😞
old Players hate this updates
They should have merged the blacksmith into the hero hall.
nooo😭 i want to use all of my heroes
5 builders are now needed to upgrade heroes and just one builder left to upgrade buildings 👍👍👍👍😭😭😭😭
Of course the equipment isn't leveled up XDDD
Wow supercell drop trash 😢 in the name of update.. Zero excitement towards new update.. What's that th. look like dry poop no eagle .. New clash team big dislike for your poop work
game got complicated asf
Air spam gona be the new meta 😅
Slow Down Coc please get new town hall in 18 months😭
I would like to thank almighty devs of COC for giving us the new hero starting from Level 70, not from level 1 🫡
Minion king looks so goofy 😭😭 compared to other heroes
We haven’t seen a new hero for a long time! Looking forward to see your gameplay with the new hero in the future :)
Coc now 🤡 Coc when it was in 2015🗿
Which hero do you think he will replace?
Let’s go I need to upgrade more hero levels to upgrade my town hall in my alt account 😡🤬😭
I dont know about this update it feels like a bit overvelming for new Players to start and its getting a bit too complicated in my opinion
I feel like the hero upgrades should not use up a builder anymore. It should act like the laboratory or pet house now imo
I think this is the best town hall in years
I wonder how the new researcher works with heroes 🤔 or will hero upgrades still be affected by builder boost. It changed towards laboratory style 🤔 Also if they put another hero and dont give option to boost hero upgrades, people will just upgrade defend heroes and use hero boost to attack heroes
I have a question,I have townhall 12 village does in that level I get minion king❓
Love from india ❤
hero hall getting bigger and bigger every second is hilarious 😂
*How much level worth Minion prince and Hero hall I will get?*  if I am at *Th 16* and I have    *RC* lvl 44 (upgrading to lvl 45)  *Warden* lvl 69 (upgrading to lvl 70) *King* lvl 55 *Queen* lvl 53
Level automatically capped to 70,such a blessing.
So max th16s will get level 70 minion prince or level 80? Confusing
I think upgrading the heroes still using a builder does not make sense. Just like the pet house, we upgrade the pet house using a builder but we do not use a builder to upgrade the pets.
I love how the minion prince is actually made to be a mid-stage hero and is being used to allow people to customise their hero loadout instead of just the same 2-4 heroes every time
Worst update in last 3 years
As a fresh th13 at the beginning of hammer jam and halfway to max of current levels (7 for king 6 for warden, 12 for champion, 6 for queen), The levels are the same of what it normally is, right?
whit town lvl 15 what lvl would be my minion 60?
I'm a th16 and with rushed heroes. Will i have to max out my hero hall before upgrading to th17?😭
ok i will be rushing to TH 16 now, so i have lvl 70 minion prince
Man when will we get this in the Philippines
The minion prince is very underwhelming. Supercell put no creativity into it. Basic working principles.
PETITIONS FOR A SLOTH WARRIOR❤❤❤
Hi
Honestly I pray that they let us still use heroes that are already upgrading, ik you can now substitute your upgrading hero with another, but if it's someone like the Warden, that's a massive hit to your attacks. And give us blacksmith materials in the battlepass pls, the grind hurts
When is update judo am new
someon who understood the minion level thing what level will it be for me i have 50queen 45 king 34warden at th 12 i know the hero levels are kinda rushed i will get them to max before i go to th 13
Will I lose my hero
Thank you Judo , love u from Iraq ❤
Bruh can we only upgrade 1 hero at a time
My favourite supporter Judo 🥋
Sadly, u can't use all the heroes 😔
When update judo?
Im already loveing new update
I have level 85 queen. So what will my Minion Prince be for level?
Can i select judo sloth as hero 😂
Nooooooooooo
With every update clash of clans become a mess
Bye Bye archer queen
Supercell sucks again
Would’ve still preferred if they did not remove the Eagle or they could’ve made the town hall’s defense system a bit more like the Eagle. In this update, they should’ve merged the TH with the Flame Flinger😂
This is so unbelievably stupid holy
I'm currently at th15 with only minor defenses left to upgrade. Do you think its worth to rush to th16 to get a much higher level for hero hall and possibly a much higher level of the new hero
😂😂😂  judo clicking him as hero . That was funny 🤣
That Minion prince grin on his icon the best 😂
When is the update?
wait so as a th 15 should i hammer my th to lvl 16 so i can get 10 extra lvls on my minion prince or did i understand this wrong?
Dude so we will forget about that cool hero alters ?
Im glad the new heros name isnt "private investigator"
This actually makes sense lol
I suppose if I am ever to play again, I should start working on my  PhD. Good grief. I feel like SC is just boxing out the casual player. Sad, really. Thanks for the video though.
Was it meant by judo to leak the offers for the update?
So for town hall 12 will be only 3 heroes for attack (and I'm just asking)?
inamo judo
My mini account currently at th9 is about to go absolutely bonkers
When the update is coming?
We got minion prince before true non skin goblin king
waiting for the insider scoop to find out if we have the geared up triple archer tower and ricochet cannons in this update since we're losing the geared up cannon and archer tower
Wait, should I rush to TH15 for the Prince levels then? HMMMM
If I have a level 65 queen and level 20 king and level 6 warden, level 1 rc. What level would I get the minion prince, max th12 or something lower?
I hate it
Judo i have in idea for coc that they could make a flashback event every three to two months like bring things from the past example ice wizard or giant skelton
Minion Prince❌ Dark elf King(From God of war)✅
Supercell will nerf the hero ability within 2 months🤗
I hope you'll release a new base layout video once the update drops.
Whrn is the ubdate
Honestly dont like how you have to upgrade hero hall AND THEN upgrade heros
Judo, I wanted to ask why aren't there any new upgrades and buildings ? On the builder base side. It feels like it's being left out 😢.
Ngl I expected the minion prince to be more of glass cannon. I’m surprised he’s actually bulkier than the archer queen
As a th12 the new hero looks so cool cant wait to boost him 15lvs before I can go to the next town hall im almost finished with
9:56 Okay
So basically we should all start over in order to enjoy this…
Am I the only one that spotted the minion prince hiding in the trees
"when knee surgery is tomorrow" ahh icon
if the hero hall still requires a builder why do we even need it ? Its a massive barrier when someone wants to rush too
They actually kinda solved the issue with the heroes not being able to attack while being upgraded. Now you can upgrade 1 hero but still attack with 4 with is pretty cool imo
it would have made more sense if upgrading heroes didn’t require a builder, so that it worked as a sort of lab
Does this mean sleeping animation for heroes is gone???
Crazy update not gonna lie!! Thank you for the detailed info Judo. I still remember the first video I've ever watched from you, you were showcasing townhall 12 with barbarians or something😂 the idea of a defending townhall was crazy back then. Now we are getting a new hero, dang man, time flies huh
One question that i may be miss - Can we use the hero that are within upgrading?
Lol I'm still at th15 Near max 😢😢😢 I started playing in 2016 and stopped for 1 year And started playing at the covid period Still updates are coming while we are near to Max😂😢😅
i feel like coc transforms itself to be like clash of lords
I would’ve loved to see it not take a builder for the hero’s, I’d love to be able to use my hero’s even if they’re upgrading because I barely get to use them lol. Been maxing out my hero’s during hammer jam and I’ve used the queen like 4 times the last two weeks
5:45 judo, what if I have a Lvl 58 grand warden(jzt 3 lvls above The TH14 max), Will I get A lvl 8 hero hall Or Lvl 9 Hero Hall!??? Reply!!!
I can now honestly say this minion prince is the coolest hero yet. 😎
Should I go to th11 now to unlock the warden before the update?
8:57 oh yey another thing my head hunters will run at besides the cc troops
More heroes! Lets gooo!!!!!
The new hero is from Avatar movie😂
Love your videos, just one question when can we expect for the practice maps to update ie: th 14 15 16 and now 17.
after all these years of playing the game, one more thing from the past is gone the hero alter
As we have already seen , we demand judo as our upcoming hero
Judo sloth hero confirmed
stop yapping bro
It has that th9 theme but in dark mode nice🎉
We need new ore source
When does th17 comes ?
How does hero upgrades work now then??
Damn 🫥🫥
What about Legend league? No change?
What.... He is a hero ?
Just watched the last video a minute ago  I was curious to see what the new building was  It seems like a really interesting concept  And man, having queen in th8 seems like a nice change imo Keep up the nice videos! ❤
When will the update drops?
More ores to farm..
Supercell wants us to suffer
This will be a very exciting town hall 17 upgrade ❤🎉
Im calling it, there's gonna be a hero hall apprentice next year
Unpopular opinion but I think pet house can be removed because pets can be unlocked in hero hall lvl.
What if am town hall 13 did thé héro hall will bé lvl 1 ?
in my opinion, this update sucks ass, since im still only th10 and i dont rush. i will have a hard time deciding which should defend and which should attack, i hope it doesnt change much because i am extremely stupid and i wouldn't be able to orientate in the game
I kinda don’t know if I’ll even use him  The king is just too good  I need the giant arrow Grand warden’s abilities are great for support  And Rc is great for the back end of the base
Use code: Judo
Super clean new hero system, looks great
Judo pls tell about that will the upcoming meta will like th 16? Too offensive? Or like th 15 too defensive what you think? Pls tell your views about it
Why minion prince look like a satan
when the update drops?
man i was waiting
If I understand this correctly I want to upgrade my heros past a certain hero hall maximum level before the update. That way I recieve the higher level once the update arrives and my minion prince will be a significantly higher level.
Judo! What would be the hero you replace the minion prince with? All hero’s right now seem really good, so having a hard time deciding on what to switch out. I usually use Root Riders + E titans with Skelly spells. Lmk if possible cheers :)
The hero hall is so cool. Its Features as well as its looks. Amazing🤩🤩.  Thanks judo for such educational but entertaining clash of clans videos 😅
Rip eagle🤣🤣🤣
Can’t wait to reach town hall 17 town 20 is probably going to be out by then though
Why merged eagle its better to increase layout size of the base.
Judo what about hero skins?
4 human heroes then there's the minion prince
Will we be able to use the heroes while they upgrade?
Judo is my hero. ❤
Electro spam📈📈📈📈📈
Excited*****
bruh, I don't even have the Warden yet😂😂
I think its easy 3s in pro scene...again🤣🤣🤣
Which town hall are we getting this hero on
I think supercell is making the game bit by bit complex every year with new town halls like merging eagle artillery with townhall instead giga inferno was better and I don't like the new defenses too
the good thing that stupid minion prince will start at lvl 70 for All Max TH16👍
next in townhall 18: Builders Hall😂
Another Spend for Dark Elix.  And it's hard to get dark elix. This day
300k dark elixirs??!!! Just Great work supercell Great work on slowing our progress down even more
This is great but what's the lore abt the minion prince being a private investigator😂😂
When will the update drop? Im so excited 🥳🥳
where is the new hero level based? the max for the town hall or the level of other heroes?
Rubbish update
Very good update, Judo ❤❤❤. But, it's bad luck for me, i'm almost full max TH 10, only heroes and researches are going to upgrade 😢😢😢. Please tell me, the update is on next year. If it's not, i have no other options then, rush to th 11.
so the update is tmrw or  what
I love clash on how they come up to be great until today
The new hero looks promosing for hero upgrading, now you can constantly upgrade 2 hero's and still use 3 in battle.
So I can get the hero even I am in TH15?
Kinda stupid in my opinion that Clash of Clans has not given a release date yet since I would not be surprised if everything is flushed out and ready to release. I donøt think they will implement major changes at this point in time. Kinda just an irritation so you can't plan around the end of hammer jam and the beginning of th17.
Th17 release date?
when the update come Judo? like the end of this month or first of december? great video judo!
I have a theory that minions are linked with sour elixir that why we in mashup mania and only minions prince can send them to our world and there is a world that is linked with sour elixir and minions prince rule that world and if you see he need to open a portal to summon henchman minion
R.i.p rushers
supercell definetly cooked
I am curious. I have a Royal Champion, but when I played before I thought "Heroes are bad so I will not upgrade them" (Stupid me) and now I have my BK and AQ at level 30 only, what level would my Hero Hall be?
Great video, and great attention to detail at 8:28 with the coin, liked it
We are going to need new base designs for every TH judo
minion king got that billy butcher smile
So im th16 and have gw 70 aq 82 but bk 80 so ll i get lvl 9 hero hall and lover level minion?
When is the update coming out?🤔
i got 25 level  royal champion and 63 level queen with 54 level king. and 43 level warden but my town hall is  15 (i rushed a bit)
i am going to die in th 13 its already 55 upgrade level now minion prince🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Okay I'm th11 right now so what does that imply? Will I get my hero Hall lv1 and my heroes deleveled or will the hero Hall be the max level in the town hall I'm on?
It's awful
But I’m in the Philippines so no update yet😢
13:12 Now i know what mega minion gonna look like without the armor
The most confusing Town Hall Upgrade ever 🤯😡
This is so exciting! Now we can finally upgrade a hero without serving the repercussions of not having that hero in battle, since you will always have an extra hero 😅
Nice Editing❤
We are getting 2 new heroes the minion prince and judo sloth
7:56  They should have removed builder requirement to upgrade heroes as now it works similar to laboratory. It will help a lot.
Old system of taking all heroes into war is best
They want everyone to play hydra lol 🥵 with new levels to troops🗣️🔥
Judo, now we need another Best Base for every town hall from you because of the new buildings and change in altars….
sneek peek @1:33 : Judo sloth is the upcoming Hero in TH18
Yap yap yap, another unnecessary not useful thing to waste my dark elixir on.
Is that Lil Nas?
Hope next bp hero skin is for minion prince
When I was attacking I saw him in the woods peeking
queen at th8??
Worst update yet.
Cash of Clans becomes Castle Clash more and more but 10 Years later selling it all as new Ideas. Kind of funny in my opinon. The next you will probably be able to put heros into Towers and they will release further heros. It's all just ideas from Castle Clash
new hero😊
Does the hero hall drop ressources if destroyed?
so judo would you help me by telling this, i am at th13 rn, update hasn't rolled out yet and if upgrade to th14 before update what would happem with hero?
Plane bhej
I just want use hero even if it’s on upgrade that’s all I want
i always do heros last in my upgrades because i feel having to use a builder makes it less time efficient
Judo nice
Show us level by level stats of equipments of minion prince
Nobody will use Grand Warden for Defence any morw
21 min
I think a human hero would've been better than a completely different character🤔, looks more like villain😅. Still my favourite update. Kinda agree to @elon69420
The next merger will be blacksmith and hero hall
Honestly, this is the best part of this update.
Looks like we can't upgrade multiple heroes at once like we used to. This is what the community wants anyways😢
Will th 17 update relese tmrw?
How we are getting dark elixir than, there will be 5 heroes ?
Everytime im about to max . A new town hall comes.  SUPER CELL please wait for me this  time. Need  few days to upgrade my traps😅
This is so good
It's confirm th 17 gonna be hard for everyone....
Best update ever thanks jodu and supercell for this masterpiece ❤❤❤ (use CODE judo in the shop) ❤❤❤
What happens to the rush players? Do they like immediately get a level 70 minion prince does that go for the same the hero hall? Do they also get a level 10?
Minion kind is freaking strong
When does the app actually update after hammer jam?
Weapon borrow from Dota 2 — aghanim's scepter ?
in addition to the eagle artillery, we lost warden statue as well 🥲, you will be remembered
So the only thing that I didn"t understand (prolly missed it tbh) but will the equipment be also leveled for the previous th? Or we will have to start upgrading it from level 1?
Base builders are probably shitting their pants now😂
I’m sorry but it looks boring to me. Making the base buildings smaller sucks. They’re already too small. I haven’t even attacked seriously in 4 months and not at all in over a month and I still maxed out th16. This game is a shadow of what it used to be.
10 years wasted.
we should be able to upgrade heroes without A BUILDER
I need a calculator
Queen & warden are not replaceable ❤ they are legendary
Can I upgrade my 4 hero at same time or not?
i watched other u tuber also but not gonna lie judo I enjoy your way of explaining things ...it really is very fun..and by the way with the new hero and new townhall i wish you happy clashing😎
It is looking like coc is promoting satanism 💀💀☠️☠
The old system is bether😢
Wow more air. This game is DONE
I wish that we could use all 5 hero’s in one attack because th 17 is just like th 15 it’s so hard
I hope heroes are useable whilst they're upgrading
when is the update
No new pet? The new update seems a little... underwhelming.
This game is going on the next level.
The ability is actually op wow. On the other note, I feel like Supercell would bring more buildings now in the next update as we've lost a couple of buildings because of the past updates. Maybe even more signature defenses for the upcoming townhalls👀
Wait hero prince is th9 hero?
Literally L move from supercell. Because now upgrading heroes comparatively takes more time. Because you can directly upgrade heroes now. But after the update you need to upgrade the hall first which takes an additional time. L supercell.
Not bad, but it would've been cooler if the new hero was another human.
Wait so all my heroes are practically max th14 i just upgraded to th15 and haven’t upgraded a single hero so if i add a singular lvl to any hero does that mean it’ll give me the higher lvl hero hall since i have a hero above th14 levels?
Supercell now🤡
What is the date of th17 update release?
I don’t get it why do you still need a builder to upgrade a hero? It should now be same like the pet house
I always watch itzu first just cause that’s where I get my attack strategies from but then right after I watch you cause I love how in depth you go to explain everything and make it easy to understand! Thank you!
I've a maxed out TH15, what will be my minion prince's lvl when the update comes?? Will i have to start the upgrade from lvl 1???
why a minion
When is this update actually coming
If you need max hero hall before upgrading TH, does that mean maxed accounts won’t be able to immediately go to TH17 when the update comes out?? I’m going to have to buy it and upgrade it 10 times?
i have a burning question, what if i wanted to use my heroes but im upgrading the hero hall? is the regen for the heroes slowed down or are you not allowed to use them at all?
hammer jam ends tomorrow and it should drop tomorrow. so why not give us content on th17 today
L update
now rushing is getting harder
So they’re adding another time gate to upgrading heroes. Not only do we have to upgrade heroes, equipment, and pets now we have to upgrade a building in order to get the chance to upgrade heroes. This game is so bloated
Why the new hero lowkey looks low poly
Amazing update, absolutely adore EVERYTHING it might be the best update we've had in a long time, the new hero looks amazing!
Disappointment  upgrade   of  hero   its  too  bad  😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The new heroes look like he's from Dota 2
i think they should make upgrading heroes not requiring a builder
Is this the last sp😅
this guy ain't no hero he's a mf investigator 😭🤣
I like how the th17 update doesn’t only apply to maxed players but also benefits lower level players
Finally I maxed th13 going to th14 😭😭 when will I able to max coc 😭😭
So the next Hero on Townhall 19 will be a Princess
Ok i see , th17 gonna be also the same as th16  Broken offense  , trash defense
Wait so at town hall 9, because my king and queen are unlocked and lvl 19 and lvl 9 respectively, my hero halls level will account for that?
I only use air attacks. I'm at TH12 (Very Recent)...so I think I'll switch BK with MP. AQ and Grandpa stay.
Level 70 new hero and isnt maxed... how long will this take 😭😭
If I rush my TH to 16, will my minion prince auto level from maxed th15(prev.th) hero level for minion price?
i still think they should have kept the trend of a new hero every 2 townhalls, so the archer queen would still be accessible at town hall 9 and the minion prince at 15, now its kinda weird how ac is available at TH 8
Welp. My Village Hero Levels Will Reset. 😢
I wish they could've done something else other than a minion 😔
This is so huge, I can't wait for more heroes to be added. Amazing video like always Judo! ❤️
Upgrading heros in the heros hall will use a builder, but will it also disable the hero from attacking while upgrading?
Does that means on this update if we upgrade our heros we can still use them
JudoSloth really man?? no pets??
New hero is only for air strategy not versatile for ground attacks🥲
Late 🥹🫶
I was kind of excited to upgrade him from 1 to max
Missed opportunity for supercell to call/theme it a Mega Minion puppet
I am gonna rush my town hall then to get much more new hero lvl
i dont really this system, it dosnt feel like clash of clans anymore, the hero hall is fine but the whole hero system has been changed which wasn't needed i feel
Wow what a W for clash team for making it like the leveling of the new hero somewhat same for the bb
When will the th 17 releasing date pls
when is it added?
First Non-Human Hero .....😊.....
Looking forward to Judo’s gem to TH17.
You'll get leveled hero 😋 *based on your other heroes 💀
i feel like this will be very busted for a root rider attack. use minion over the queen or royal champ and just freeze and overgrowth everything.
Lol judo is spell,hero,troop bro what are you😂😂
Bro I haven't received an update in COC so that I can access the Hero Hall or Lab Assistant I am of TH13 but still.....🥲🥲🥲
I would pay any price for Judo Sloth as my hero😍😘
You're the best CoC youtuber Judo!!
Looks demonic to me
what are the judosloth hero stats?
The real question is when does all this release?
Love supercell for giving us the minion prince at th9
Damn the new hero never sleep dawg
How I wish I could play coc again, if only Supercell actually cared to help me restore my hacked account. I just don't have the heart to start over. Th14 max down the drain, 9 years of hard work.
My town level 13 max it's Doon to upgrade to lv14 so the new hero will come at max level as my town without starting upgrade him? If this is correct I will happy😌😌
Does this mean that as soon as Hammer jam ends, th17 should arrive?
It would be nice if hero upgrade won't use a builder anymore but that's too good😅
Can we use the Heroes while upgrading the hero hall
What's super cell's thing with air attack they just keep on buffing them
judo will there be a new best th layout since theyre changing the altars?
Only that😅
Extinction is coming
when?
13:37 The mysterious who revealed the th 17 became the hero
We now unlock AQ at th8 now great
Welll.... I think (private investigator) could be a better name 🌚🌚🌚
Hi Judo ❤
It's the worst update
When is the update?
Is that the last sneak peek? If so I'm so excited for the update, thank you Judo
will you be able to use heroes while theyre upgrading now?
Reminds me of raid shadow legends
the rizzler is watching
whole game is now changed from TH 8 💀
Nice thing is lower th is also getting a new hero....👍
Can we use Heroes while they're upgrading?
Under 16 min  | \/
This is update is just for making space in the village. Removed eagle, made hero altars an obstacle, introducing builder hall rip off buildings, etc. This update seems rushed to me just like town hall 16. Supercell is already running out of ideas
3:45 judo just flexing his 60 hero portions
That beard looks op though!!!
Εγώ που είμαι town hall 10 τι θα συμβεί
Love u judo
Do you plan to not place the hero hall on your brocken base ? 😂
It would be cool if we don't need builder inside the hero hall like we don't need inside the pet house.
I think supercell has given way too much love to hero's recently like i love heroes but i think in the future update thay should  focus more on other aspects of the game rather than heroes
Low budget tzeentch corrupted Skarbrand
RIP the hero alters😢😢
When is the update droppiny?
Looks fire
Will you do another best bases judo ?
Minion prince actually looks really balanced
I Ain't Proud To Say This But Im Now Returning Back To Clash Of Clans Cause I Don't Wanna Lack Behind After This Update But Mini Satan Is Crazy 💀
Wait a minute so i can't take 4 heroes to battle unless i upgrade my hero hall?
As someone who refuses to progress past TH10 because the limited attacking strategies against stronger TH11 and TH12 opponents is pretty fun (I consistently 3-star TH11s because equipment is OP), I am so happy that the Minion Prince is available for TH9 and above. This changes up my available attack strategies and works incredibly well for me since I do hybrid air attacks. Thanks so much for the video!
Please Indonesia subtitle🙏
I dont think upgrading heroes should take builders.
They shouldn’t have changed how the grand warden defends. There’s something so creative and unique about him turning into a statue when you attacked. Sad.
Minion henchmen are mega minions without armour? 🤔
Are there gonna be balance changes?
When will the update drop... tomorrow???
I'm currently TH15. Does this mean I should upgrade to TH16 so I will have them Minion Prince maxed to TH15 level instead of maxing my current TH?
Minion equipment not automatically leveled based on TH? I don’t have enough ores for this
I have 34,000+ jems  What is the worth?
Why are builders still required for upgrading and not just like the pet house? 😭
So when is this update gonna hit play store ?
Petition to swap Lavaloon puppet over to the minion prince as it suits a flying hero a lot more
Wait so if I went to townhall 13 before the update would that make my minion higher level or will it fully just go of my other hero's levels?
I think no builders should be required in the new Hall.
I guessed right!!
Slowly becoming castle clash
Anyone got the upd?
I missed so much due to exams. This update seems so promising.
so you are telling me just cuz i upgraded my queen to 51 i now have a stronger minion prince  LETSS GOOOOOO
What happens if my King is hero level 91? I'm TH 16. Will I still get him at level 70?
Why would the hero upgrade still need builders. That sucks😐
Hero hall is one of the best things added ever
This update looks horrible button
will the warden still turn into a statue or no while defending?(omg i didnt watch the full video and played from where i had paused it and u just told me the answer in the vid)
I would have preferred a elixir hero, not another dark elixir one...but starting at level 70 is very good!
Bro my heroes are low level compared to th-
3:45 that's not a simple mechanics now Clash of Clans is become more tough for new players and old players what they are do this creation make Clash of Clans more vulgar
so to upgrade any hero when reaching th17 we need to first upgrade the hero hall?
Thank you so much
Who tf did you manage to play with so much heroes?💀💀 By 2040 we'll have 10 heroes
Hi judo what's the release date of th17 🔥🔥??
Nice
We've got judo sloth as new hero before GTA 6 😅😅😅😅😅
Finaly the demon is here
yeah thats cringe. i think ill quit
Give us a royal kitchen with royal cook  as a defence ad magic snacks items available for the new building
I kept hearing hero wh*re lmao
The minion prince looks like a blue devil instead of red
By the way I bought using 60 dollars using your code in the offer shop
I think soon there will be a 5th hero slot
Now we miss grand warden statue after eagle😢
Update when tomorrow?
What about the equipments of minion prince should we have to upgrade it from the starting or we get the upgraded level of equipments for our specific townhalls?..
nooooooooooooooooooooooooo not this the new hero i cant accept it
Love You videos Man , You explain perfect everything
any ETA of TH17?
Judo posted guys!🎉🎉🎉
So sleeping animations of hero skins are no longer available?
Whats the point of the new hero if u cant use it all
hell he looks like will smith
having more heroes unlocked than we can take into battle is also great for another reason. Now we can upgrade a hero and not be massively impacted doing our attacks.  We also wont need to opt out of wars which helps with ores!  Edit: Thanks for the likes!
When i tell you my heart SANK when i saw that level 90😭
Aladin ka gin..!! 💀💀
Will heroes still be unavailable when we are upgrading them
this is dumb 😂
I love it this is what all coc fans want
This is by far the best Hero update we've had, not only with a new hero but housing them in 1 space with all the info we need. Alters taking less space is cool! But the UI is very clean as well
I hate what they have done with this just why
Judo using judo instead of minion prince 😂😂
So if i have lvl 91 archer queen i will get lvl 10 hero hall and lvl 70 minion prince?
literally STATIC 8:53
I saw him in the bushes!
I REBUKE IT
Great another reason why l wouldn't upgrade my walls  CAUSE WHAT'S THE POINT (Excluding the Queen) OF UPGRADING THEM!!!
The hero arm was visible occasionally in the trees on the left of the waterfall of the main village
Not all Heroes can be used in-game, some are youtuber
My builder is cooked 💀💀
Quick question... does my heros get upgraded automatically when the update released?
Bulked minion is a nice addition
wonder what minion king  looks like?
They did the Grand Warden dirty with that model in the hall
No way! Can’t believe they are making it so queen is unlocked at th8. I always remember th9 being so monumental cause you get the queen
Called it about the hero slots
Hmmmmmmm ok.
Hi Judo
The new hero hall seems very cool especially for new heroes that can be added in future without overwhelming the battle aspects with heroes.  I also hopefully see that the new minion prince gets some skins and follows the original three and four heroes in future updates.
This is 🐶🟫
Dang th17 will be fire⚔️🥇🥇
Are you married ?  Pls reply judo Btw many many love and support from india
Can we have a Judo Hero? 1:34
What happens if my heroes on TH13 already maxed out??
Bro what you use minion prince at th9 & queen at th8😮
I dont care if he is strong or weak, his ability seems cool as hell to me
Under 1 hour anyone?
Cant imagine that guy in dress 😬
hi judo can i get a picture with you please maybe on online call
Seems like an action packed update. I’ve been maxed for a while and excited for new stuff to do and changing meta.
Man I wish I had higher hero levels I Have my heroes at level 60 and am town hall 16 now I regret it
Damn this game only gets better
time to replace the dumb woman the wall breaker aka the archer queen
Judo please check your email. From : G.Kishore Kumar
yes we have a fifth hero 💪  but i'm still sad about the eagles artillery 😭🥺😩 it was my favorite weapon
So if your hero levels are somewhat close to the max based on your TH, mine is 15, the minion prince should be 10 lvls behind what their max is. When you unlock the hero hall, will it be auto upgraded to your current TH level. Or will we start right from lvl 1?
The best thing is now no upgrade difficulties for hero since now hero choice
Nah clash of clans is cocked
Seeing the level of heroes supercell should allow us to use hero while upgrading. That’s only reason keeps me to upgrade hero as i love wars
It' s look like "KIRMADA " in ChotaBheem☺️☺️☺️
The good thing is that we won't need to upgrade the new hero 70 times 😅
Hero ❌  DEMON ✅
Its even more cramped in the hall
Hello our handsome judo
We losing trophy with this one🗣️🔥🔥
Hero will be available to use when upgrading?  If this is similar to lab upgrade then just like troops/spells are available to use when under upgrade. Make senses to have hero avilable under upgrade.
Supercell slowly trying to get rid of rush players 💀
Can't wait for Golem queen
I dont know if i like this update or not im used to the old way
i genuinely thought the new hero was gonna be mega knight
can i get a chance to interview you or just make a colab video please
So if someone is rushed. Does it mean that the minion prince will be suddenly maxed for the previous town hall?
I can't believe that this game have gone so far
So minion prince lvl depend to your town hall lvl?
I'm th 13 so will i automatically have the max hero hall
new hero dajjal
I’m curious about the level of the minion prince, my warden is level 67, so 3 from max, but my other heroes are 5 levels from max, would my minion prince match my warden and be maxed or match my other heroes and be almost maxed?
Soooooo cooooolllllll🎉🎉🎉
5:49 So if the archer queen is level 91 and king is level 1... So what level will the hero hall be?
I thought we can use All heroes at the same time
Why supercell does stupid things… level 90 minion is killing the longevity of the game. Make it level 30 and give us levels every once in a while… pretty disappointed… also why make it available at th9??? Who’s th9 these days? It takes a month to get to th10 basically…
This new building should have been just a building to select heroes, not something upgradable to unlock hero levels
Can't wait for the update! Just about a few days left! Gonna call all of those builders out of the huts! Glad we could start the Minion Prince at lvl 70.
I nearly wept when i thought my lvl 95 heros were being capped at lvl 10 until i did 10 upgrades on a building that didnt exist yesterday 😂😂😂
DOES THIS MEAN I HAVE TO GET ALL MY HEROES AGAIN?!?!?!?!?! (im th14)
i just upgraded my th to lvl 13 during the hammer jam and got my royal champ; can't wait to get another new one already!
Hi guys , is the TH17 available to upgrade now? If yes which country has new upgrade availability coz in my country there's no new upgrade available for Th17
Yay
Op
Best part of this is always having a hero down and still being able to attack
Man this seems complicated 😅
I don't like it I want the old Clash💀
Wait so I have to change my heroes to defend everytime? I am confused Judo, do you still have 4 heroes defending the base? Or does that disappear
My fav channel for coc
You always be the first who uploaded ,thanks judo
Another W sneak peek and vid
We got 5th hero before gta 6 🗣️🗣️💀
I want to choose Judo for the hero😂😂😂
Rushed players are cooked💀
So the upgrading is still the same for heroes? It's just a redesign😢
I love his design
Do you have to merge the cannons and archer towers to be able to go to th17?
Hi judo
Another dark elixir hero I'm getting tired hahaha a little bit more I will quit coc hahahaha
Clash of clans is getting too complicated and I love it
0:04 Let's wow a new game changer hero 🥲
Mini satan 👁️👄👁️
Them: Who is your favourite hero? Me: Judo Sloth 😅
cant wait for  the bowler princess coming with th 18 next year
When does this update come out?
We have blue satan, aq milk and purple mike now
Hmm i thought we will be able to use all heroes in war wtf could have increase hero slots
No more hero skins sleeping animations 😢
Can’t wait for this
A.W.E.S.O.M.E LIKE JUDO ❤❤❤
Dragon hero will be real one day....
The Heroic Update.
Removing hero alter was definitely made to save space 😂
they are really pushing people to get bigger screen devices, tiny screens aint gonna cut it anymore :(
finally new hero lol
So can only use 4 hero in battle not five. That's unexpected.
Finally!! waiting since TH13 for a new hero !!
Barbarian King-Tank Archer Queen-Damage Dealer Grand Warden: Support Royal Champion: Flanker Minion Prince: Control or Denier  What I observed
Rip F2P Players 💀
Why do the characters models in the hero hall look so cheap and devoid of soul?
LoL I thought we can use all 5 heroes in an attck😅😅
6 minutes👍
can we upgrade hereos without builders already...
So excited !!! ❤
Letssss gooo i love these approvements they're doing great job supercell
Exit Eagle Artillery, Enter Satan
Cool thanks man
Last time I was this early CC troops didn't move away from poison spells
Yo w vid what a guy telling us all of this
Dota 2 ahh hero selection screen
Hi judo! TH 17!!

It is nice that we start with level 70 minion prince
I love this game a lot❤️ complications , upgrades ,longevity  clasher since 2017
Unnecessary addition
We can't get all of them into a batle😢
I’m vary happy about the new update
When is the update ?
limited to 4 heroes only?
So now we need to wait before we can start upgrading our heros in the next townhall? 💀☠️ instead of reducing the time they increased it bruh
I knew it from day 1 😂😂
When is the update?
Supercell should named dat new hero [ Minion Daddy ] than Minion Prince
I have to upgrade the Minion prince from level 1 to the townhall level 10 ahh men this is bad a*h...
can't wait for judo next viedo for maxing th 17 on first day
Hopefully we can select Judo as a hero in upcoming townhalls
Judo's rushing videos will be more interesting now.
It will make coc flop.although it is now
He just doesn't look like hero. Terrible looking
So , he officially got kicked out as a investigator and decided to become a hero 😂
Judo you excited for the update tomorrow in COC because I am
hahaah suckers i'm first to comment
hero which doesnt look like hero, disappointed 😢
Judo i am seriously not getting your notifications I have to manually search for your videos and the reason being your videos are the best out of all COC YouTubers
1:40  Slot No 1❌  Sloth No 1✔️  Yes I would like to take Judo into Battle. Thank You, Supercell😂.
I swear COC is hella different compared to a few years ago
Like if you love you best friend
4 min ago and very early
Thank GOD we dont have to grind 90 full as levels 😭😭
I mean they could have developed a completely new character instead of making a troop as hero...😢😢
OP HERO ✅
This mf looks like a cartoon villain
🤝
And absolutely nobody is surprised
So adding hero but we can use him is just so uselessssssss I hate that they should allow us to use 5 come on 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Prince suit for him. Every hero has a royal name
Today, the whole day I waited for this video, these new updates are interesting, Judo💕
The update gonna be cool . Btw what will be  your next videos about? something cool ? or something funny or may be something else??
Well time to get back on the game
Never expected minon to be a hero😮

No matter How good he is, i will use the OG Heroes
supercell should pay us to look at minion prince
Lets go!!!!
Can't wait for mini heroes as hero accecories
Someone made a video about hero hall much earlier but didn't explain in detail
I didn't like the hero slot
Me when i saw judo post yesssssssss
Welcome back to the channel then guys, I'm your host Judo Sloth! Bring it back!
Why is it like mini satan😅
I KNEW IT WAS A HERO SINCE THE FIRST TIME I LAID EYES ON IT, HEHEHEHEHEHE HEHEHE. First non human hero, nice

I think Coc is so crazy now😂❤🎉
Will it be possible to use a Hammer of building on the merged Town hall 17?? I don't have any books as a f2p player... :(
It seems some weird from OG days
Always wait for your video. Best explanation. Thanks Judo. Can't wait for the update.

Mini devil fr
Zyxw
Awesome sneak peak Judo
Like for New building 😊❤
It's kinda off because other hero are human... And another to upgrade lol
Wow mind blowing 😯
The amount of refreshing I was doing 😂
Not the hero we deserve but the hero we need
Nice
Bro I'm only th 12😭
Finally I can bench 3 Heroes for my Air Attacks since Warden won't be only the only essential hero for offense
Ur sneak peeks are the best because u share full information
Now when is the th18 sneak peek
Wadsup judo
Finally it's here the final sneak peek so we will get th17 in 2 or 3 days
The update isn't even out yet and I already miss the altars
