REVEAL STARTS AT 24:40!!!
You done such a fabulous job😊
I DID enjoy this video cause I have been meaning to do my backyard as well so it’s cool to see one of my fav person do his and how. And I always think to myself this would be so much easier if I was a guy and watching you makes me think no it’s the same regardless of it’s a girl or boy doing it 😂
Look super gorgeous 🪴👍🏻🪴
please don’t ever stop making videos, you guys keep me going been watching u guys forever now !!! I LOVE YOUU GUYS ❤
Solar powered water feature perhaps? No wiring required.
Ryan single handedly inciting my patio core era for this summer. Already starting a mood board
Beautiful as I knew it would be. Ryland's got skills.  I fell in love with the swing! 💙
his moving camera is everything
make some friends on bumble bff xx
i would like go to a coffee shop 3 times in our 9 month relationship . i was a prisioner
its giving battered housewife -coming from one
from the way you shop scarcily i can tell hes deeply programed you even in your speech and the way you talk like the rhythm and flow is off
ugh my fiancie never let me leave the house either
A crumbl cookie in the flowers 😭
The only thing I miss about California is del taco lol
Loving the store with the cats!
Learn to read before you buy and read reviews, and why is it that Ryan always has to say mine about everything what abouy Shane its his house to😢
Stop saying you are a girl. Jesus.
You did such a great job
Not you outing honey 😂😂😂
Tummy time is super important as a parent to help our babys head form and develop healthy and appealing for their future partners 😊❤
Looking good you2
So fun with a Patio makeover!! When your umbrella weathers I'd highly recommend looking at Pergolux Pergolas! Love their louvered roofs which open and close with a remote, also such a sleek design, best investment for my backyard since it is maintenance free!
Can you please stop adding the sound effects when eating or drinking please 😅
I literally just found your vlogs two days ago and I have been binge watching them they are so comforting ❤️❣️
Shane, it’s not your legs fault with the shoes, they’re just ugly
wait i don't wanna hate or anything, but why do i hear "us girls" constantly coming outta a mans mouth? i am confused. like ME girl, i have backpain for life cos of my big titties, monthly menstrual cramps with mood swings, weight gain and whatnot AND am currently restless at night can't lay or sit cos i am carrying a baby in my belly. hmmm. no hate tho, just don't like the choice of words.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
the chairs are bad i agree
You are so motivated around the house. It’s inspiring 😊 +want to mention the boycott but others have already done so. +lilies are toxic to cats/dogs
You should renew the outside tile! With a shiny look
You did well ryland ❤
I know this is 3 weeks old but if your pot didn't fall apart yet maybe you can put outdoor friendly glue on all the cracks 🤞😁
you do more in a day that i have my entire life
i love how much of a handy man you are, Ryland. Shane is a lucky guy, i wish my husband was like you lol
"for my birthday I decided to treat myself and redo the courtyard."  "Look at my lesbian dogs"  "we didn't even have a wedding the first time."
You could try and divide the patio space, you could use a pergola - that also has a box at the bottom for planting more plants -  to divide the dining section from the lounge section have the plant side of the pergola facing the dining table.
Slippers for around house with pads so you can run outside if needed too ❤
Ugh. The Starbucks product placement ain’t it 😒
Looks fabulous!! They also make solar powered water features!!
This was one of my favorite vlogs so far!! 🧡🧡🧡
Your background gives the enchanto house lol love itt ❤❤
Ryland is always moving, he goes out, workout and eat healthy. Shane stays inside and complain. That's why he never feels good, and actually he likes to be sorry for himself
Oh .. look at my lesbian dogs😂😂😂😂
SHANE LOOKS AMAZING !!!
They might have gas try a gas medicine. For babys there natural ingredients in there and realy help
Ryland you need to try the Target brand sparkling water!! The best and I’ve tried so many brands. My favorite one is cucumber mint and strawberry mango! Please try them!!
Ryland, I absolutely LOVE your videos. You, Shane and Morgan are my all time favourite YouTubers <3 That being said, the slurping and swallowing noises are killing me 😩
you should turn the horse into a Beyonce Renaissance disco horse!!
Ryland the pot too big for the plant. Always go one size bigger from what it comes in   Cause you end up putting to much soil. That the roots will find it hard to absorb the water. This will cause the rest of the soil that has the trap water to create mold, which kills the plant.   Hopefully, i explained it well  @rylandadams
You did such a good job!!
You are so good at this! I’m going to re do something now lol
I love that you and Morgan are "do-ers" watching your videos motivate me to get stuff done around my house that I have been putting off. I wish I always had that kind of energy haha
I love the Ryland homemaking vlogs.
Is it the tan? Why do you look so 🔥🔥🔥🤩
Okay, good hair day ❤
Can we discuss how much nicer is Ryland's hair now that is longer??
What’s the name of the hardwood store he was at with all the little kitties
Why did you use a dolly when you have a golf car
Shane didn't help you at all
Boycott Starbucks
I used to run that juice Ranch that you went to and I love the main owners of that company. They own 4 or 5 other locations in Southern California. Their first one opened in Santa Barbara. I believe they also have 2 boys. I know they have one for sure. But I think they just had a second boy. Maybe they had a girl. I can't remember but I hope you liked it. I'm gonna finish the rest of the vlog to find out but their juices are phenomenal. You should try the little miss sunshine and the greens and ginger, I always get it with extra ginger cause. I love it. Also, when the watermelon is good, you should get the Endless farmer. If you like jalapeno, you can get the jalapina. And they make their almond milk and cashew milk from scratch. Everything is organic and cold pressed. It is the best.
Ryland you can buy cool  solar powers fountains that would save lifting the patio ❤
Support Starbucks when we should be saying FREE PALESTINE please don’t support Starbucks
As someone who does character parties those yeezies things look perfect for under costumes 😂
It looks great Ryland! Amazing job!
Boycotte Starbucks
Everything great love u guys. Awesome patio but ALWAYS CHECK ON PLANTS LILIES ARE TOXIC FOR PETS!!!
Ryland cleaning the pool and doing gardening in his video praying his pool guy and gardening are watching to SHADE them and their shotty work 😂😂
Break up the roots before you plant the plants. 😮
Using the restroom at erewhon but  going actually shopping to Albertsons is everything 😂😅
I really enjoy your content
I’ve had my outdoor furniture for 4 years looks good as new! The key is having a gazebo 👌🩷
Anytime ryland posts a vlog I'm there at high speed 😂 its lowkey comforting to me hearing him talk about furniture and plants. Also the plants are nice! But lillies are toxic to cats
It’s the growth spurts. There’s always a regression period in between where you may have a week to two weeks that are sooo challenging for baby and you.
thanks Ryland for the promo code !!!!! me and my manzzz are going to blink 182 concert original prices  $348  using your code  now I'm paying $198  ☺ love you guyssssss!!!
Ryland holding the drill on the steps in the intro, is so iconic 😂❤.
I LOVEEEE THESE KIND OF VIDEOSSSS
I felt the same way about the Starbucks drinks! it gave like cherry medicine with like soggy boba. Imma need starbeez to stay in their lane and leave the Boba to the other girls
The sipping noises make me wanna stitch knives in my ears lol. Is this how Shane feels 😂😂
can u both share what u did different after getting the babies becuz both of you are GLOOWINGGGG. im serious, i wanna know. did you change your diet or sleeping schedule or what?
I miss Colorado
Is Shane on ozempic ? He looks good !
It looks great!! Property value just increased
love the makeover !!! you did an amazing  job as per usual. I think an outdoor rug would make it look fabulous <3
Ryland openly being a swiftie makes me feel so seen
That courtyard OMGGGG KINGGGG 😍😍
Make sure you scotchgaurd that outdoor couch!! It makes such a big difference
Lesbihonesttt, Honey just living her best gay life 🤣
Not the Teletubbies *Sun child* w Ryland's face 🤣❤
So I guess they’re keeping both houses
Waiting on the next vlog. I’m sure your busy with the beautiful babies. Just know yall were missed. We had Lizzie, Sandee and Jerid today and just felt incomplete without one from yall. Best wishes.
Where’s the baby toys 🧸 lol
I screamed when you jumped in the pool! It was so green
😂😂❤
Yall should do a video under the influence of the green stuff
Just heads up Lillie’s are very toxic to cats 🐱
Great job!!
I love that this is a whole video of you guys buying dumb shit with no payoff. Very appropriate.
as a swiftie I completely agree with you I feel the same about her album you get it ryland
hi guys <3 i am a lifelong fan of you BOTH and this comes from a place of genuine love... please please please look into the starbucks boytcott and everything that is happening in palestine right now! it it so important to withhold your dollars from them but also to not promote them. i truly believe that once you guys are educated about it you will no longer support them. this is extremely important. free palestine!!!
Wow. It turned out really beautiful. 😍
Can you be that rich from YouTube?
Ray could be a room or house decoration designer for live and vloge each job be dose
I have a Taylor swift tattoo part of her song blank space(cuz darling im a nightmare dressed like a day dream) is what my tattoo says and i never seen her at all i wish i could afford to see her
You guys so cute together babys love them ❤👨‍🍼👨‍🍼
Ryland I love you but the plaid throw pillows are offensive it’s not Christmas time and this isn’t Scotland honey. This is a Spanish vibe courtyard please please get some Spanish style throws and burn the plaid ❤ u.
27:26  it looks amazing!🤗 but can I say love the person in the background at this time I’m assuming it’s one of the men who did that grass? 😁
Used your code for the Tyson fight❤❤❤
love you guys SO much but idc for the starbucks considering what's going on in another country... it comes off as insensitive plus there are waaaaay better coffee places!!! still love you guys though<333
I love your videos but the least we could do is boycott business that are supporting a genocide 😔
twink can build it!
Ryland, watching all the hard work that you do inspires me to get all my hard work stuff done around the house done too!
8:35 the next 20 seconds of Shane just existing is ADORABLE 🥹 He’s literally my best friend that I’ve never met 😅
Ryland does literally everything! I hope Shane helps in other ways!
Haven’t been here in a long while, what happened to the Colorado house??
Ok no. First mistake,  buying anything from crazy Kanye. 2nd, how do the drinks have no flavor. The lemonade is very tart but flavorable. The coconut milk one literally tastes like cotton candy. Give them another try, get them from another starbucks.
I feel like it needs a outdoor rug to tie it all together 😊
I wanna see the patio lit up at night!
Why don’t you buy covers for your outdoor furniture to protect them from the sun? Then you can indulge in the expensive furniture you prefer ❤️
Ryland is such a Taurus lmao
Get the square big blocks from LOWES or Home Depot in the garden area. They slide into each square on the base of the umbrella
Who still supports Starbucks
I think the reason I still watch Shane and Ryland is because they’re relatable. They’ve never tried to be someone they’re not and they’ve never let the cars and houses get to their heads. They’ve always been so humble
pooks, stop supporting starbucks !! but also love the patio !!
The fact that so many of you watched this video and only comment to gripe about YOUR BOYCOTT, YOUR BELIEFS. That is your choice, you cant make someone else believe in what you do, or do what you do. Either supoort someone for who they are, or dont.  I love how your answer to solving a problem is to not eat mcdonalds or starbucks and not joining the actual fight by idk signing up to actually fight. 🙄 Leave people to live as they want, as you have that very option by boycotting a brand.
Ur a Swiftie and ur supporting Kanye? The math aint matching? Love the patio tho!
You can get the boba in any drink I suggest getting the strawberry acai lemonade with the boba it’s so good!!!!!!
So a solar water feature.
I kinda like the half painted horse. He has character.
Seeing the joy that this makeover brought Ryland is so refreshing. As a fellow Taurus girly, I get it! He's out here living my lil outdoor renovation dreams!!! ❤😂
Whats up with the camera quality!
Bestie no offense but who edited this vid ....
Love these videos😍❤️
What’s the details on the hanging lights with a timer and the table?
I think you can dye  back the tiles red ❤️
Rylanddd you are looking good your skin is glowinggg. Shane is also looking slim and I can see how much more confidence he has become, okayy dad glowww!! ❤️🤗
It’s honestly insane how productive you are omg
When I have a busy insane work day at least I know I got a great ryland vlog to look forward to ❤❤❤❤
I’m excited for summer you 🥰. Your hard work was worth it , I would also spend a huge part of my life in the courtyard. Maybe solar power water feature would save the electric cables fittings. Take care xx xx
PROUD OF YOU RYLAND!!! ❤
When you're done transporting water from the grocery to you home - I've go the best water device making medical quality water. Good for natural cleaning too!!
Ryland, you are doing amazing job. You’re an amazing mother. You’re an amazing father. You’re hard-working homeowner and the landscape is looking incredible. The table, with the umbrella, with the plants, with the swinging couch. Just continuousness all throughout.😍😍😍💁🏼‍♀️🤭🤭
boycott starbucks
My girl huskies are always mounting each other also 😂
Omg I want to see it at night 😍
DUMB as A bag of ROCKS ???  PERHAPS???
You gotta get the summer berry lemonade drink with popping boba it’s way better! the ones with coconut milk suck.
not the starbucks guys
degnerates
Y'all have a beautiful property looks good Bud!!! Hope you, Shane and the babies are doing well!!
I really like your hair like this
I’m not a huge fan of Shane anymore…. I’m bipolar, have borderline personality disorder and a bunch more but if I had just had twins (Ik it’s a hard time for some ppl) but Shane does not seem to actually care or love Rylan or the boys…. Idk maybe he’s going threw something but it just seemed/seems he’s not interested and Ryland does it all
What doesn’t Ryland know how to do? He’s like the perfect husband, always caring for his home and family! Shane is a very lucky guy ❤
such a beautiful patio omg!! love your work and I appreciate the sunrise, green grass, and flowers too!! 🥰🥰
Lily's are poisonous to animals
Love your roses!!! Get some Plumerias for fragrance in your courtyard.
Please chill with the random gifs and noise edits they are very annoying and cringey
Honestly; wish I had Rylands ambition in life 😮
❤❤ I love it it's absolutely gorgeous I wish I can afford a house like that cuz that patio area where you just redecorated is the patio area I was always wanted it's beautiful
It looks GREAT Ryland!! Looks so inviting and SO GOOD!!!!!!!
Luv it Ry... Keep the Vlogs Coming!😁
Your dreams always comes true
Soooo am I the only one who sees the person in the bg watching at 27:24 😳😳😳 freaky!! 🤣🤣🤣
A water fountain with a solar pump may just work
The fuss is typical developmental stages. Every time babies are about to reach a milestone (motor skill or emotional), they go through these phases. Completely normal! Also, some teeth early so that is another thing. I am also LIVING for this patio reveal! I wish Ryland would redecorate my entire house!
I was also going to mention the lilies… I would just say maybe plant them higher at least  but they are toxic
I think this was definitely one of my favorites!! I love a good makeover
Think Shane leading here, more  important to get the bous grounded than materalistic
Did you sell the Colorado house?
Does Anyone know the song that starts at 2304 in the background
You are a busy body 😂😂 sooo much energy 😮😮😂😂❤❤❤ Think of securing the pool in the future so your little ones stay safe!! Some acquaintances of mine lost a child - drowning happens soon fast!!!
ohhh honey, wait until they have 5... mine is like a little adolescent, and I'm a super strict latina mother... believe me, enjoy their rough week, it´s nothing... hahahaha stay strong!! I'm sending you good vibes!!!
It looks awesome Ryland!
so your still supporting starbucks knowing there’s a war going on and they’re funding israel
Everything looks GREAT Ryland! And your rose bushes are stunning! 💛
It’s been awhile for me is this the same house they showed 2 years ago? Or did they move again
I was not prepared for Unos old boi face 🥹🥺🥹🥺
Remove the lilies it is toxic for the pets
Lillies are toxic to cats. Make sure those babies stay away from them 🐱 but otherwise so nice!!!🥰
The album sucks. Swifties saying they have to listen to it 80 times before they like it are in denial lol
We’re boycotting Starbucks! Just to let you guys know!
Looks beautiful! Good job ❤
😮 I love it, good job
Shane’s just happy that you’re happy even if it’s not something he cares about and I think that’s what love is ❤
Shayne’s personality… the swing scares you as a 40 year old man? Oh dear. It’s okay to grow up.
I absolutely love your decorative vlogs!!!
The Yeezys look like glorified divers shoes or grippy socks
Yall need 2 try the summer skies drink FRESHHH COLD ICE ITS ACC GOOD BUT ONLY RIGHT AWAY
I love yall but no Starbucks free Palestine 🍉🍉🍉
I’m so happy it wasn’t just me tht hated the new drinks lol
Ryland I love you sm sweet baby child, why are you carrying your dolly? lol.  it is literally made to make your life easier and not have to carry things sweets 🤦🏻‍♀️ you are lucky that you’re so pretty 😂😂
Get rid of the lilys please, can cause fatalities in your animals.
I still can’t believe you guys out parents ! Like what ?? Love you guys . God bless
Ryland is serving HAIR!!!! 😍
Um, wait, excuse me…. Albertsons still exist?!?!?!??!?
Nobody commenting on how they could have ordered from anywhere else. The accountability is wild
You should do eating off of 10 dollars a week or a day since you guys do live in LA that would be a good video
Tell Shane the Dolan twins posted a short story on their channel. It was really good. I thought Shane would enjoy watching it if he hasn't yet
I love you and I’m so sorry but as a person w misnaphomia these sounds make me want to throw my AirPod across the room please quit it lol I feel like Shane I want to watch these but it really throws me into a rage - sorry bout it but I couldn’t hold it back this time 😅
🎉 beautiful
Growth spurt, get Wonder weeks app or book ❤
vlog idea! ryland your vlogs are gold and the editting of this one was notably 👌, lets get a voiceover of the editting process, or let us see a little;, maybe include how shane edits different than you, how often you get interrupted, how often you change your mind or commit and execute to new ideas, show us how long it takes, how you know when it's done, etc .... 🎉😊
I love it, the yard is very open and clean and homey. The flowers brings it all together. However, sorry but the throw pillows on the swing isn’t it , get another color maybe orange , mandarin bright pillows 👍🏼 Besides  that it’s just gorgeous and the curve appeal was needed it looks lovely . Great job 👍🏼
It’s amazing Ryland! ❤
Try the Bigby Blast drinks with popping boba. Don't even know if California has Bigby but it's my favorite
Guys boycott Starbucks
still waiting fo MY YEZZYs   smh its been 4 to 5 months   they said it would take most 4 weeks
I’m a sucker for string lights, can we see the outside at night pretty please!!!
I miss uno 😂
I think you will be fine returning the umbrella to Costco. I see people returning their mattresses all the time.
Omg!!! At 22:25 when you put the pot down, i thought you said "its a little to rough for my afro puff"  like that 90's song!!!! 😂😂😂
The boys fussiness is called leaps. Look into it. It’s super helpful
Everything looks fantastic. You 2 look absolutely amazing. Love to see your Happy faces
Lol "look at my lesbian dogs" has me rolling 🤣
Some lilies are poisonous to dogs and cats 😢
Love y’all!!!!❤
You should plant herbs, they repel bugs, fresh herbs will taste great in Shane's cooking, and most of them are perennial.  I think those "shoes"? are for walking in water, like at the beach, not for wearing like regular shoes.......but idk
Are the babies teething?! Check their gums, they may be trying to cut a tooth. Teething is for the birds.
Your vlogs are perfect for when I’m cleaning too 😂
Happy birthday!!! 🎂
Am I the only one that noticed the random person standing in the drive way at 27:24? I can’t tell if that’s Spencer lol
Wow!!! Love it!!
It looks beautiful ryland ❤
In the future that water feature area will be covered in kid toys. 😁
Shane looks good he looks like he slimmed down.
you should do an episode of the sip on the patio!
I love how ryland is a man of all trades!
Great choices for the patio - it looks fab ❤️
The editing on this was AMAZING! CHEF'S KISS 🤌❤️
please please pleaseeeeeee no more slurping sounds. absolutely terrible. it's like nails on a chalk board. i can't take it anymore.
So many sound effects, background music and clips in this video, so much going on
As always, nice job, Ryland! Looks fantastic!
How are your Alpacas doing? I think of them often 😂 such cuties
Okay. I wasn’t so sure at first, however Ryland Stan 💯 Obsessed 😍
Check out leaps for the boys and there periods of fussy before learning new skills! I think the app for it is the wonder weeks but there is some great resources online!
why does Ryland sound Irish at 8:47
We needs links please 😍😍😍
Hi Ryland.  I love your little courtyard.  I took love flowers of all kinds, it's so enjoyable.  Maybe if you have a bare wall put up a trellis and have climbing clamatis?  So elegant.  I love what you've done, but my favorite was watching you power wash the tiles.  There's was something so fulfilling in scrubbing and seeing it all look so clean.  Good job Ryland!  If no one else told you, I did.
pls do a day in my life
PLEEEEEEEAAAAAASSEEEEEEE STOP PUTTING THOSE DRINKING SOUND EFFECTS WHEN YOU TAKE A SIP I CANT STAND IT AND LITERALLY HAVE TO CLICK OFF??? YOU DONT NEED THEM
Love watching these vlogs 😊🫶
Shane looks so goooooood 🔥🔥🔥 love the make over too, but I can't help but acknowledge how great shane looks 👏🏻 😀
When did you start adding these awful tiktok  sound effects to every little thing ? Please go back to when you didn't do all these SFX.
I'm Pakistani
I just love watching room make overs! This is definitely his forte ❤️
dutch bros has a location in West Covina if y'all go for drive, and they have poppin boba!!
In the southern states they have outdoor mist-ers/humidifiers to cool down areas you should look into them.  :D
The Taylor swift clip !!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’m being so fr everything Yeezy is so ugly to me hahahaha! I think it’s all so tacky & not worthy the price 💀
pls pls pls stop with the clickbait titles we’ll still watch just tell me it’s a patio makeover sis lol
HOW R THEE ALPACAS ':0
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT TYPE OF SPIDER THAT IS??? I’ve been seeing them around lately
U did a absolutely wonderful job! It looks great, n I love the couch
If you cant return the huge umbrella I want it ❤
Forcing my husband on me who no offense ryland i come for shane then just stay and i like ur friend when you do attractions like Disney's and Orlando studios all ive done is a wildwaves and bullwinkles in wa state
Ryland and Shane should try DUTCH BROS popping boba next 🎉❤
Mulch can randomly combust catch on fire by itself. Bd careful!!
Omgg I love the way u designed😍 🌻🥀🌴
Ryland acting like he’s broke and relatable in his several million dollar mansion
Wait the Yeezys are just straight up jazz shoes with boot spats 😂😂😂😂
Gosh I wish we can be friends. You are so fun and easy going
FREE PALASTINE. WHY ARE YOU STILL DRINKING STARBUCKS
Ryland, you remind me of like a little old man who goes around the house fiddling with everything… it’s so endearing.  Also, everything looks great. Can we please stop talking about Taylor Swift already though… pleaaaaase?!
Please boycott Starbucks Shane :(
🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇰🇼🇰🇼
Something I envy about Ryland is his motivation to take care of his home! Shane is really lucky to have someone keep up the home lol
Ryland, go to Home Depot and get an all-weather seal. Go on a non-windy/breezy day and spray down all your furniture support. It’ll survive the constant sun beating and the icy weather. You’ll just have to change/bring in the cushions
I have a big cover for my patio furniture. It takes a minute to cover the furniture when not in use or when it’s going to rain. This helps the  cushions from fading & disintegrating from rain.
I didn't know I just needed a horse galloping sound to Ryland's graceful running to grab his camera, but I did. That made my whole day. I sure love you all and hope you know I feel ya. I also need a day to sun rot and couch rot. ❤ I am so happy seeing the sun come out, but I feel like there is too much to do when all I want is to be a lizard on some pavement!
i don’t know if it’s the hair or what but Ryland, you are looking like a hot ass dad. shane is one lucky guy
Ryland motivates me to get up and take care of my house 🙌🏽👏🏽🔥💅🏼🤣♥️
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY 🩷
research sleep regression!x
It’s stressing me out that you went shopping and got sandwiches and left them in your hot car
Please be careful with lilies around your kittycats! They are SO poisonous for them, even just a tiny bit of pollen can kill them😅❤️
I think the horse looks cool with the red and white spots! ( but in person it probably looks alot different) also I love you Ryland but I’m not sure I love the outside table but again I’m sure it looks way different in person…. But all together your doing such an AMAZING job with everything!!!    Also I just wanted to say I’m so jealous of how much energy you have Ryland!!! You make difficult things look so easy and yea I’m just jealous….I haven’t had energy like that in years (currently I’m sick with a sinus infection, ear infection, and pink eye 👁 so I feel awful!) but I also am dealing with severe depression and anxiety so that doesn’t help 🥲 everyday I wake up I hope I’m going to feel better and have SOME energy but it’s just not happening! So yea I’m jealous of how productive and energized you are….one day I’ll get there 🤞🏻
The Starbucks??? Are you kidding me that’s insane and embarrassing
Your breakfast looks so good ❤ can you give us more videos of what you eat in day I love it 🥰 anything you post it great love the SIP as well 💗💗💗💗
there is an app that i swore by during my baby’s first year! it’s called the wonder weeks & it teaches you all about the different “leaps” your baby is making in their development and when one is coming up so that you can prepare for it and best support your baby through their mental and physical transitions!
Marissa & Caden did a good job editing this video 🎉
it looks so good Ryland!
Im manifesting for vlogmas in Colorado 2024
Don’t get a horse to abandon it like your alpacas. Stop being impulsive
❤
Sleep regression is the hardest days ! And when the teeth come in 😭 momma of 2 here too
This was soooo entertaining to watch!
Ryland how in the hell do you get time to do so much 😂 my baby was born 20 days after your twins and the struggle is real. I'm happy if I can make dinner 😅
Okay okay I’m sorry but I have to say it! Ryland you’ve always been my girl Bosh but when your hair was wet!!! Damn!🥵 lol
Y'all should paint the horse a dark gold
Does Shane ever do something? lol 😅
LILLIES ARE VERY TOXIC FOR DOGS
Immediate watch every time you post
Two white men supporting Kanye, and Starbucks and excess consumerism is not surprising at all just disappointing knowing their audience is younger who looks up to y’all.
how does the couch not mold from the rain? & thats a little ridiculous for the pricing to be $500 these corporations scam us daily
You should film evening podcast episodes on the patio this summer!
New hair cut looks fire❤❤❤❤
The amount of editing some of these clips had was nauseating at times ngl 🤒🤒🤕🤕🤕🥵
"... and then I am going to Albertsons" LOL!!! I love how real you are because honestly, the only people who shop there are either ridiculously rich or faking it. Thanks for being real!!!
You could put anchors on the wall and have a huge cover that goes across
I live for the cleaning, decorating and shopping videos. ✨
It looks gorgeous RYLAND! You did a beautiful job ❤
Wow. Amazing, beautiful work
Happy Happy ... Much love 🎉
Love ur videos ❤❤
Love yas but please stop going to startbucks, so many better options!
Ryland, watching you gives me motivation to GET SHIT DONE! Lol. Thanks for sharing ❤
wow a BBL Drizzie supporter
Hey Ryland! Just wanted to say that I think you're my most favorite vlogger and I appreciate your videos so much ( I've been having a hard time mentally and watching you do your everyday stuff really does help me with my anxiety and depression!) Thanks for being the person you are. Proud of you! Love you so much ♥
Turned out beautiful ❤️
Ryland with that hair.. HOTTIE! OMG and Shane’s been looking healthier than ever. They’re both THRIVING in their dad era ❤
I’ve never unfollowed someone quicker than I have when I saw them excited about their Yeezy purchase
I stand by the fact that you need your own design show! Beautiful job!
Girlies please not Starbucks 😭
Lilys are soooooo toxic for pets, I’d get rid of those, not worth it! 23:13
Not Ryland making me feel nostalgia for Albertsons I wish we still had them here in Florida 😭😭 brought me back to 17 when I would buy the mix ins for cold stone there when we ran out 😂😂
No trigger warning for those with arachnophobia 😱😱😱
when you were worried about the umbrella being too big I just wanted say how great a size it would be for two strollers or bassinets or playpens in the shade! ✨🧡
BOYCOTT STARBUCKS!🍉
How is Shane a Cancer and not into flowers, sunsets and green grass?! This is shocking information to me 😂
Hey Ryland, I think your patio makeover is great. From one Taurus to another, Happy Birthday!!
I don't know if your cats go outside but Lillies are very toxic to cats, even the pollen.
It looks soooo beautiful,  be careful with the lillies though, they are extreamly toxic to cats and dogs x
I don't know if you even going to see my comment Ryland. But dose chairs you moved, they looked a little.... yeah what can I say.... dry. You should fresh them up with a fine sandpaper and then a paint them with wood oil.
happy birthday ryland have a good day with the boys 🥳
I think you should paint the horse black!!🔥 also you could get a solar water feature!
Ryland being a gardener, pool man, house decorator HAS ME DYING
This is no shade but what classifies someone as trending because I swear I’ve watched videos that get more views in a day then this? So?
No one cares get off the internet
Maybe try a solar powered water fountain 😊
Why are you gay?
Well done you garden looks lush x
That’s too funny. I got my Yeezys today. You should wear socks though.
Shane is looking thin
Spring Cleaning? I think we’re past Spring Ryland 😂
I love giving everything a facelift in the spring, it’s so pretty!  Love your courtyard what a lovely place to hang out in! ❤
The shoes are fucking ugly they were $200 ??? And u wasted $20 ew
shane is looking so good!! proud of that journey fr 💓 also enjoy these videos so mf much i missed them! i love the new ones but definitely missed the revamping vlogs makes me excited to do the same my 2nd time watching already 😇😇🤍
Ryland you should get a cute rug for the patio to throw some color in! And get someone to power wash the sidewalk in front of your home!
One thing Ik for sure is that you SSSSTRONG  giiiiiirl lol 😂❤
Loving the beard shave look! Goo' day from Melbourne
28:08 try removing all the cushions and coat the basket looking base with a clear glue/setting spray or weathering stuff
It's missing an outdoor rug and the horse HAS to go.
I feel like it needs one more couch! Its beautiful!!
You've really outdone yourself Ryland! Looking amazing! And the hair loooks so good!
Ryland you are a male, a man, a boy, a father. You are NOT a female, a lady, a girlie or a Mother. STOP the nonsense before you confuse your sons or will you call your sons girlies as well??
Happy birthday 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
26:18 you did an excellent excellent job! Wow❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yeah that horse stands out big time. Yall just got to paint that fast LOL
Those roses you can win gold medals for those. I'm like wow
Happy birthday Ryland. You know you could have got all over the furniture it lasts for years and years and years. But you always do a magnificent job so I never doubted you for a second.
You two need to need to replace those Lilies with something else. If your cats get out and even so much as inhale the pollen, they will die. Even drinking the water from a vase of a Lilly is lethal.
Funny watching this as they’re coming into summer and I’m coming into winter.
Ryland I love these!! Not every video has to be a ✨ work of art ✨. Sometimes simple is perfect. I watched this while I brushed my teeth, did my laundry, read my emails, etc… It was like me and you were doing our chores together. Thank you for trying and putting in your best effort. I always appreciate you. ❤
Take a shot every time Ryland says he’s going to “LIVE” out here this summer”. Cheers!!!!
You look so hot after the shower at hot yoga. The hair cut really did it lol
I love those roses!! And they're yellow??? gosh
I love these types of videos so much!! :) great job ryland, another gorgeous renovation!!
😮😮 https://youtu.be/oH4hWRizleU?si=mb1Xb6XYayoXycUK 0:36
Happy Birthday, Ryland! Taurus girl here, too! May 11th is my daughter's birthday and mine is May 15th!
the courtyard montage gave me whiplash 😵‍💫😵‍💫
Oofff not you supporting Kanye
Trader Joe’s. Yes. Leaving erwhon for Albertsons hell yesss not your typical la people which I love
You have talent  The courtyard looked so good
Yeah fire the pool guy and the gardener cuz they should have done what you told them to do. Why do you even have to cut your roses when you are paying a guy. And cleaning your pool?
Put an outdoor rug underneath the table or sectional:)
Ryland should be an interior decorator
The front of the house looks especially good. The patio is beautiful with all the plants and the new furniture. There were also a lot of good edits in the video.
Hey! What occurred to me that you had those Starbucks drinks delivered ,so it might be watered down and the Boba may have lost the texture. That might be something you need to go through the drive-through and drink immediately. Just a thought. I wanted to share a link to this cobbler who basically does shoe reviews and disassembles them, and has some awesome information and insight…  he just did your sock shoe fro Yeezy. Any time I want to purchase an expensive shoe, sneaker or boot, I’ll look and see if he has done a video on it. Let us know what you think!  https://youtu.be/s-N0_D__M0I?si=oylCYT93-76XbfBg
just dropping by to remind everyone that shane is a groomer 😃
Your house is so gorgeous!
Great job! 👏 love the snail planter
Idk what it would be but Ryland needs a show on HGTV or something 🥰😂
My bday was may 11th. Happy bday hon.
Shane looking THINNNNN 😮❤😮❤ YESSS QUEEN!
I love all your videos,  love all of you ❤️,  but for the love of God,  no more slurping and swallowing noises when u drink Please lol , it's getting old  ❤
Just be careful.  Lilly's are very toxic to pets.
i’m curious if they know lillie’s are toxic to cats, i don’t remember if there cats get outside tho 👀😭
They make some really nice covered gazebo/pergola type of structures with wrought iron or another type of metal frame that is a rectangle or a square that has a vented fabric roof. The sides have both a set of walls made of  screen mesh to keep the bugs out and let the air in. Then it has curtains which can be tied open or pulled closed for privacy or to block the sun if it is too bright.  You can add lights similar to Christmas lights or bigger ones. You could also have a hanging light or a lantern of some kind. A  Moroccan style would look amazing. You can have a table, chairs and other seating inside. The one we have also has a floor similar to a tent's  floor. You could have the boys outside with you and they would be protected from the sun and any bugs or insects that are out there.
I literally just bought yellow lilies. So gorgeous! Then I read the packaging and they are deadly to humans and animals. Not sure if your dogs sniff around or try to eat flowers or not, just thought I would mention cause I got those exact ones and now have to watch my dog like a hawk
I love how much pride he has for his yard!!!
Ryland are you still editing your own videos? Or Shane or someone else you hired? Sounds effects on point 😂
Happy Birthday!!!
Sweet pea, please learn how to prune roses properly, it hurt to watch
On days you plan to go to the grocery store take a cooler with some frozen ice/cold packs to keep the items that need to be cold or in a refrigerator at a safe temperature. I hope that you didn't get sick after eating the food you left in a hot car as you went to multiple stores looking for items for the makeover of your outdoor areas.
Ryland has been extra gorgeous lately. Love that for him.
Hello Ryland. Oh hello Rylands Shane.
Maybe a wooden Pergola that lands 1 foot away from each roof. There are some with retractbale shades, some people plant flower vines isntead for shades.🌺💫 Also make sure your new mulch isn't laced with asbestos.👍  Oh and wicker, and basket weave attracts spiders so watch out!
Get a professional to clean your grout.  It’ll be like a whole new floor
I loved this more than you tasting food! This had it all.. wild cats in a store, plants and LoVe ! Congratulations RyRy
Moreee vlogs
Happy Birthday gorgeous❤
Happy birthday
Happy birthday!! 🎂🎈🎁
This Vlog Turn out to be amazing THAT WHAT!!!   I enjoyed it Cant wait till the next adventure
WARNING!! Ryland please be very very careful. Those yellow lilies in the snail planter are extremely toxic for your pets!
Absolutely beautiful 😍 ❤
Forever impressed with the amount of DIY Ryland can master! A king.
Be gay but dont act like child molesters
Ryland you need to open your own renovation business
Where’s Morgan been?
Aggggggg its
I am loving the horse noises!!
Happy birthday, Ryland!    🎈 🎂
Love today's video.  I just enjoy you Ryland!  Courtyard came together and your video edits....hilarious
HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY, QUEEN!!!!’
Ryland! I found another charlie in the same color and in black in woodland hills!
Loved the revamp Ryland. Here’s 2 suggestions, you don’t have to do these but I just want to mention….Add in some colorful rugs in the future, I also love adding some side tables anywhere I can. Next to your swing or couch❤️
I enjoyed the spruce up so much ❤
Absolutely Gorgeous Ryland, Great job!!! ❤😍
WHY DO YOU PUT IN ALL THE AWFUL SLURPING/FOOD NOISES! ITS DISGUSTING AND TRIGGERING TO PEOPLE WITH MISOPHONIA!
Happy B-Day Ryland! It's May 14th where i live
loved the makeover and your hair cut is great!!
Heyy just wanted to warm you that Lillies are highly toxic and dangerous to dogs and cats!!
Happy birthday Ryland!
❤❤❤ H a p p y B i r t h d a y R y l a n d ❤❤❤
Happy birthday!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABY BOY ❤❤❤
Ryland! You are such a beast! A bad ass! A freaking amazing husband and dad! Look at you just picking up furniture like it’s nothing and getting shit done!!!!
I need to know who that is in the background at 27:25, pls and thank you :)
Those Yeezy things look like they are worth $5...even $20 was a scam 😂
Ryalnd... I love you, but all I can think about is that tuna wrap you left in the car while you shopped around several stores for definitely too long to now eat that tuna wrap 😅
I love the patchwork horse!!! Leave her be!!💛💛💛💛💛
Happy birthday Ryland!!!!
Taylor Swift being part of #Blackout2024 👏👏👏
Kanye guys?? really? damn 😭
Happy birthday 🎉
Wow amazing job!
Happy birthday mother!!!
Happy Birthday 🎉  I hope this is the best year yet!
Ugh I wanna come hang out for just a day!! We could slay some designs together! I'm obsessed with interior & patio decorating! You need to get the cutest biggest outdoor rug! That courtyard needs an outdoor rug to tie everything together, & add a pop of color! Lot's of beige going on! We know you have bad luck with rugs! Haha 😂 Sending you & Shane , the twins the most love & positive vibes!! 🩷🌼 Edit, think about adding some really cool opal/rocks on top of the soil of the palms! Add some bling & dress things up a bit. I don't live in LA, but I'm obsessed with adding faux bird nests in my trees. Oh! You could even add colored cool marbels on top of the soil of your planters. We have all rock beds, & I added like 100 bags of marbles to them, & it added the most bling ever! So unique! Also wrap a strand of fairy lights that are battery operated, around your palm. You can set a timer on them too. You can pick those up at the dollar tree! I have so many strands! It's just the small touches that are so neat! 🩷🌼 I keep thinking of things! I'd say look into concrete stamping, but I'm loving the stone. And don't be afriad of working with different colors of blooming plants, instead of all one color. Some pink roses mixed in with the yellow ones would be cute!!  Ok 1 more tip & I'll shut up! I promise! Mow your lawn diagonally! It's great for the grass & adds that luxury look. A lot of us lawn freaks do that here, although we probably have more lawn to work with, it really makes a difference. Again, it's great for the grass & keeping it healthy, & adds the best curb appeal! Ok I'm done, I'll leave you alone! Haha. 😂 🩷 🌼
Happy Birthday 🎂
Lilies are poisonous to cats and dogs. Succulents would be better in the snail
Yeah my daughter didn’t like the new Starbucks drink either😖
Omg happy birthday ryland✨😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ryland, you should paint the horse rose gold <3
Happy Birthday, Ryland 🩵🎂
Happy birthday Ryland 🎉🎉🎉🎉
It looks amazing! Happy birthday!
Haha same my birthday is may 13th and every 7 years it lands on Mother’s Day but anyway yeah I love being outside I work outside it’s the best ❤
Happy Birthday 🥳🎉🎉
Love it ....awesome job...happy birthday to you
Loving the haircut and I’m not sure if you’ve had your ears pierced or not but it’s a vibe ❤  Also, fantastic job on the patio!
Good job Ryland! Looks great ❤
you could get big outdoor rugs for under the couch and table to 👀😁
Aww the snail got a new flower so precious 🥺
i’ve been a viewer for more than 10 years. i am incredibly disappointed. FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸🇵🇸
Ryland you inspire me to be an outdoor girly and getting my yard in order.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY RYLAND! ❤ Love from Germany! 🇩🇪
I wish i could afford a house 😂
Do a solar powered water feature, no breaking tile required.
I always love your reveals Ryland! You’ve got such an eye for design!!!
Yes there are several songs that arent my favorite...but there are several i listen to on repeat daily. I also have no doubt in the future different songs will hit me in different ways at different times in my life. The eras are always era-ing.
I recommend one of the dollys that turns into a cart! Very handy
You could also just do a Sun Sail over the patio and save all the floor space and falling over issues.
Yall still supporting Starbucks is very telling.
You didn't look at the yeezy pods size guide?
Love it!! Can you not get covers to preserve the outdoor furniture? Xx
HAPPY BIRTHDAY RYLAND
❤
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DADDY! ❤🎉🎉
i’ve literally watched this video 3x already lol
Just a mama comment, because you mentioned the possibility of a water feature in the future. Think long and hard about that because of drowning risk for the boys. Also, a pool gate is super important. Love y’all, you’re great dads!
i love your vlogs. ❤
That ozempic is ozempicing Shane
I’m gonna be so sad when you paint the horse I love it patchy looks like a legit patchy horse it’s beautiful that way I dunno :(
Omg I'm loving the editing 😂❤
Mental and physical growth leaps SUCK sometimes, but the babies are making HUGE leaps right now, so just think of this as like the tide. It ebbs and flows continuously, back and forth, continuously. So just remember, the tough times will pass. Just hang on and keep your routine constant! You got this! ❤❤❤
You both look amazing! 🤩 also that patio is fucking iconic love love love
I'm a sucker for all things home decor... I'll say about 70% of my Pinterest pins are for home decor. I admire the work you put into redoing your home to improve on the joy it sparks on you. I really like y'alls house! I wish I had the option of working full time at my home.
Did you get STD? I hope so.
The editing on this video is gold 😂😂😂
Does Ryland still have the catio he built? I haven’t seen it lately?
This video gave me motivation to put together our new chairs for our patio. Hard to do with a newborn but I did it!! Thanks for the great content.
Lol loved how Shane popped up and rylands pink cup aligned with Shane saying "hot mess"
Been supporting yall for years and to see u guys ignore issues that are going on in the world and support brands that are part of the genocide in Gaza is insane, I hope u guys stop supporting Starbucks and McDonald’s and become aware of the world, all of ur fans in ur comments are so out of touch as well, they don’t call u guys out on the clear ignorance yall have on todays world issues, yall want to be drama.m-free so bad but yet support Starbucks so much
Shane looks snatched omggggg yassss
U guys are so out of touch with the world, are u guys so naive or ignorant that u guys are still consuming Starbucks????? Do you guys not know about the Starbucks Boycott, yall been supporting Starbucks since the ban, I know y’all have social media and are aware about Palestine but yet refuse to acknowledge it, STOP SUPPORTING STARBUCKS, READ THE GODDAM ROOM!!!!!
27:25 Who’s that random person with their arms crossed in the background?? 🤨
the patio looks great!!! so much effort - but now you can be satisfied - it looks so inviting - and I love love love your flowers💖💖💖
You need to get some Fushias!!! The colors are gorgeous and they look like ballerinas dancing🩷🩷🩷
I really liked Shane's shirt so i looked it up and it's fucking $80 *sigh*
Hoping and praying and waiting patiently for one of you to speak up about Palestine. Please can we make that happen. All you have to do is donate and ask people to help donate. Bring awareness to it. Something. But I guarantee you won’t nor will you stop providing a huge platform to these other celebrities who are also ignoring the GENO CIDE happening. I love yall so much but come on.
Aw loved this! So inspiring ❤
USE SAND BAGS FOR THE UMBRELLA STAND!!! my grandparents have always bought 2 bags of sand for each umbrella and just put them on the legs (sand still in bag) easy to move and clean around and wayyyyyyyy cheaper
I love the way everything turned out! You should put egg swing chairs on your balcony for you and Shane. I also love you both! 🩷
THE CATIO. What happened to it? 😢
Happy Birthday 🎂🎁🎈🎊
Ry u looking hotter everyday since becoming a dad #sorrynotsorry
Every time I start the vlog I think “oh I clicked the podcast instead of the vlog” and then I’m like oh wait nope it is the vlog.. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Those are the ugliest shoes I've seen, sorry
Oh Ryland - my man works construction all day, so he couldn't care less about how the house "looks." He does the heavy stuff, finds me great free furniture (from the richies!) and paints and mows. BUT... I'm a bit jealous of Shane now! YOU (as a Taurus) get your stuff done. My husband, as a Taurus, gets OTHER PEOPLE'S stuff done (hey, it's a living!) You both wake up early, cheerful and ready to go. I am the PISCES - late for everything, draw and dream, plan and dream, hope and dream... but I'm pretty useless with the material world. We need YOU! -Lost in New England.
House hubby Ryland 😅
Love all of y’all ❤
just Rylan being an earth sign, and Shane being a water sign 🤣 look at the bark in the trees!! I like the beach. Haha
I feel like a stone outdoor set would slayyy😍
Ryland, U are my FAV Mama!!! I will always stop my day to watch your videos! More, Mama! U & Shane have always made me so happy! I get withdrawal when U don’t post regularly! Love U both! And, Thank U for sharing Jet & Max with us!!! Gorgeous family!
Lilies are extremely TOXIC for animals…NOOOOOOOO
Makeover turned out to gorgeous! Just get rid of the dangerous lillies. Bad for your pets and babies. Not worth it. 💛
1) Lilies are extremely toxic to animals. Please get rid of them for your pets’ safety 2) Boycott Starbucks. Does genocide taste good? 🤔
love those terracotta tiles
Boycott Starbucks girls
You ate YOU LITERALLY ATEEEE
Ryland you literally ate that wow
I'm a Taurus girlie too (May 11!) and I also bought myself a new patio set for my birthday this year ❤️😂
You should do a DIY fountain in the middle!
When you were talking about the boys having a monthly rough patch of fussiness, they are probably going through leaps! They have an app (or at least did when my boys were babies) where you put in their due date (not birth date) and it will tell you when their leaps are coming and what to expect!
Hey just wanted to say I love love love the final look! Very cute love what you did with all the plants!!! I do want to add to be careful with the lilies because those are poisonous to animals. Very toxic we wouldn’t want the dogs to eat them or even sniff them. Just wanted to let you know! Love the vlogs please keep them coming!!!
Lmao! “I’m just walking in here to use the bathroom, then I’m going to Albertsons” 😂
Shane should be more supportive as well!! You work so hard ryland. You are literally jack of all trades
The patio looks amazing!!  Ryland you are incredible at make overs!!
Quick question.. not sure if he mentioned it.. but is Ryland living outside this summer?? 😅😅🤣
I have been off youtube for a bit, so haven't been keeping up too much, do they still have a plan of going back to colorado? I loveee that house
I love youuuuu but why those controversial brandsssss
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Can you please show the patio when its all lit up at night time?
I could literally watch you clean your house everyday don’t ever feel like we don’t want to watch something bc chances are we will!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Your decorating skills are the best. Nothing is better than getting your house ready for the lazy summer days 😁
I love these types of vlogs Ryland. You are a bloody workhorse.
Congrats ❤️
I’d never leave that courtyard ❤
it always cracks me up when Ryland is struggle bussing moving heavy furniture and Shane is never anywhere to be seen. When there's something to taste though, Bam! here's there. They both crack me up. Love u guys so much.
Ryland you are such motivation! You are a super hard worker! Love the revamp of outside!!
Looks amazing Ryland 😊
how are you supporting Kanye
It looks amazing guys!!
Ryland is the queen of DIY and interior design 🖤
Ryland!!!! The reveal is AMAZING! GORGEOUS! Go off queen! You did that!!
Thank you for your content and sharing a small portion of your life.
I think Ryland’s hair journey is over because he looks like a full on MEAL these days
Looks amazing and lovely 😍🌹🌹
Please don’t support Yeezys and Kanye.
Taylor Swift coming thru Ryland's vlog at exactly 13:13😂🎉❤
youre making me want a backyard so bad
You put so much thought into this and it shows. From the placement of the furniture to the placement of your plants. This is amazing Ryland. You are amazing. Good work as always!!
7:22 the way my jaw dropped, lmao bye
Very good videos
your babies need to get out of the house lol imagine them seeing the world.
Ryland is such a Taurus hahahaha
Omg it turned out so cute!
I still need to know what Shan meant about you pooing around the house tho
Love everything in this vlog but could pass on the Yeezy content, as a Taylor Stan I’m surprised you support him!
Ryland find someone to show you how to prune roses. Hon you cut to a third leaves and they reflower. How beautiful all the flowers and everything you did a fabulous job
you should look into something you can use to treat your patio tiles, they look shabby, but I'm sure they'll clean up nicely!
I’m a simple gal. I see Ryland posts, I watch it repeatedly and binge others until the next is posted. Simple simple 😂
I love your makeovers!  You do such a great job!
How's it feel to be so wrong about the summer-berry starbucks refresher? (The coconut milk one can go to hell)
Ryland makes anything entertaining. I could watch him count chocolate chips. I will still click lol. Sending love to you and your beautiful family 🖤 thank you for bringing sunshine to my day
Do people call mulch “bark?” I was so confused about what was being installed until I saw it 😂
Dutch bros boba is better!!!!!!
Was in my way home from work earlier and saw a cyber looking vehicle turning down the road that leads to the small college and career centers.
Please not more Taylor Swift. We have to listen to this every Wednesday. Please no
You should buy fire glass rocks for your fire pit in your courtyard. They sell them in many different colors and it looks so pretty!
ryland has the motivation i neeeeed!
maybe look into WHY yeezy is so cheap rn..
Looks so good!
The lemonade refresher was pretty good.
IDK if you have a steamer but you can steam the wrinkles out of the umbrella.
Omg shirtless Ryland!
I love y'all so much <3 Max & Jet have the best dads ever!!1
im happy for u yay!
SHANE SO HEALTHY
Did Shane loose a bunch of weight or is it just me ?
Ryland, is the husband of my dreams 😂
❤❤❤❤
I LOVE your theme song btws. It’s great 😄 I especially love when you and Lizard turn your heads in the bathtub 🛁
Why would you mentioned Drake in your SeatGeek ad? 😅😂😂😂 lol I know I know, this might’ve been filmed before.. but that coincidence lol
Ryland’s editing 🤣🤣🤣
28:20 if they start turning red it means they’re getting too much sun, saying this just in case as you said they’re in the full sun all day 🫶
Omg I miss these and forgot how much I loved that snail pot 😂
skipped the starbucks part......... slow news there?
I do feel it’s missing more colour tho as it’s all one tone
Buy some furniture covers to protect your furniture while you’re gone, or off season.
I love makeover videos
In time you'll have a water table and a sandbox for those boys in there and the time spent in that space will get better and better for all of you💕
You know what this Vlog is… ..Amazing 😉 Just love a day/week in your life. You didn’t need your Mom you did amazing picking out all your stuff! ❤🤙🏼
Ryland I love your videos and I watch every single one as soon as you post it. Could you please cut out the slurping and swallowing sounds. I have Misophonia and I am sent into a fit of rage every time I hear those awful slurping and swallowing sounds. I think you might even be adding them in. Could you please just not add those? Or take them out? Please ❤
Boycott Starbucks
22:03 Just a little tip for gardening girlies, when you take a plant out of the pot, especially if it’s root-bound, loosen the roots a bit before repotting to avoid root-rot and encourage growth 💚
Does anyone else feel that Ryland is surprisingly very strong? The way he carried away that huge table all on his own was so impressive 💪
No, Shane….. it IS Kanye’s fault. Those are hideous on any and everyone 😂😂
Starbucks really guys
How can you own three dogs and two cats and not know how toxic they are to pets?
02:43 sounds like he says, “I deserve tits.” 😂😂
- the roses are glorious
Just got home from work Cur/ 4am. Was going to continue watching game of thrones but actually wanted to finish catching up with you and Shane. You guys are doing great. Quality content. Where’s the Patreon Act.
Love u guys but Starbucks?🍉
Is it me or is Ryland looking skinnier? Hot mama!? 🌻
The kangaroo paws haha 😂 as an Aussie this makes me lol
They better be carful before they are added to the blocklist
Hey Ryland I recommend you wax your hair since it will still be soft but holds in place and won’t look so dry. ❤
My advice. Get a metal table with wood pattern-look. Bring cushions inside on rainy days. Your furniture will last longer! That's what we do. Have had the same furniture for 10yrs.
Lillies are TOXIC to pets. Like shut down their kidneys before you can even do anything about it. It’s poison. It KILLS.
I live in Scotland so we obviously have no need for pools in our 24 mins of sun a year but…is it safe to be in the pool whilst you clean 😬 I love the decorating videos, you always nail it
spray paint the horse instead of actaul paint?
OMG I looooooove Shane’s doberman shirt! pls reply to tell me where it’s from😂 I have 2 Dobermans and that shirt is a must have
Not the hair dresser trying to see if he’s a singe straight man
Love what you did, it's very pretty. But how about an outside rug? I think that would make it even better ❤❤❤
❤❤
I think another umbrella over the couch and some out door rugs would help invite ppl to sit out there
I just realised... How so that exensive funiture. Not survive the winter... There.. I live in Sweden... The cheap outdoor furniture even survives xD
Watch out for the Lilis. They are toxic for Cats and dogs
Ryland is like a Sims that I've put working on his skills and chores for endles hours, haha!
Orginal bobbas don't pop :P
Have learned for others mistake..  ALWAYS look at the description.. ALWAYS look at the reviews!
Ryland do you actually define as a gurl?
4:54 Regarding the Umbrella: I'm not sure how it is in the US but in Germany with these kinds of stands that are shaped like a cross you use 4 square stone or concrete tiles that fit right into each segment of the stand. It's pretty sturdy and probably a lot cheaper than a new stand 😇
@Rylandvlogs lillies are poisonous to dogs and cats....if your dogs eat plants etc, may be something to be aware of
WAIIIT, if your kitties ever go outside LILIES are poison for cats!
My favorite thing to watch is your Vlogs!! ❤❤❤
Didn’t Shane do a conspiracy video that showed us how Trader Joe’s is literally just Walmart shit with a different label
Ryland u need to get a pressure hose and cream cleanser for the outdoor tiles it will make it turn up so nice. Also get a large hard bristle to scrub the tiles and the orange will turn up so nice outside in the patio area. Love y’all
Literally ending the vid once i saw gen0 starbucks ew
Shane is looking 👀 great 👍🏼 keep it up ❤️
Me waiting on my pods since February lol
“Look at my lesbian dogs” sent me on the floor crying lmaooo for no reason
Ryland is so beautiful
Love it!!
Yeezy and Starbucks in under a minute was certainly.. a choice..
Does Shane do anything he’s sooo lazy, a frog on a log 🐸 🪵
Please get rid of the Lillies they can kill your cats
Absolutely love having a video to watch after a stressful week! And Shane’s looking slim and might fine, get it 😍🔥
14:08 you staring that hairdresser down is something i would do LMAO
Love love love all your content ❤️ I look forward to every week watching your videos and podcast!!
OMggggg yes these style of vlogs are back!! you are both looking so good! Shane is thriving, I've watched him since his skits, and watching him grow up and become less depressed lmao is such a blessing. I am so glad he has brought you into all our lives. I truly love you both so much.
Great job! Just saw lonefox and his new house. Could be fun to see him do your space in collaboration with you next time
I love your house!! It’s so warm and cozy. You did an amazing job with the court yard 👌
Do u not take out the babies
I enjoy these Vlogs. It's always entertaining to see how people live their lives.
I know your kitties are indoors, but for those out there watching please be careful of the flowers you have outside and inside your house if you have cats. Lillies are one of the many highly toxic flowers to cats. If they get any of the pulp from the center of the flower it can cause serious organ failure. Lillies are my favorite flower, but their centers do fall off and create a dusty mess. Just a little info to keep pet parents' kitties safe through the warmer seasons <3.
LOVE YOU GUYS!! So happy watching you 2, now 4 & the animals!!!
The casualness in which you dealt with the black widow…would not be me
Ryland you need the wheeled platform for your pots!
Ryland is my source of inspo and motivation! Love these vlogs 😭🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻✨❤️
Thanks for making me feel lazy! In a good way! I need to get out into the garden pronto! Its a jungle!!!! Looking good on your makeover!
You are right about the grocery jams! Im old enough to love the grocery music for the most part lol! I think our whole country cant afford  an Erwon! Well London or Edinburgh but I could just see some of the crofters and their sheep up here in Scotland having a viceral reaction to a shop like that lol!!!
Who's standing in the background at 27:24 ?! That scared me 😂
Happy early birthday You're exactly where you wanted to be and dreamed of in life ❤
Ryland the outside part it looks okay after the reveal but the tiles look so dusted and I think if they had a polish to really show the color it would go a long way
A with can do witchcraft
5:38 Why no one talking about Shane getting excited about the Yeezys and Ryland quickly trying to defuse waking the babies up🤣🤣
Beautiful makeover! Just want to let you know lily’s are very toxic to pets (and maybe little humans, but not sure)
The yellow flowers in the snail pot! Nice to see you happy & designing your home with what sparks joy in you! ✨️☺️
Ryland !!!! YOU are sooo cute !!! 💕 enjoy all your hard work… ✌🏼💕✌🏼💕✌🏼💕  You did good .. 😉 You should be proud of yourself 😘
YES another Ryland makeover vid!!!
Ryland? New series? Redo Outside patios for other YouTubers. Like an OMG we’re coming over for the OUTSIDE. Redos by Ryland
Love the makeover videos! Always a fav! And as always I love how it turned out!!
Get polywood table set!!!! You can clean it and back to original color. The teak (spelling) color would look great! Tell them I sent you! 😂😍😍😍
Love your little familyyyy ❤❤ Makes me so happy!!
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ it's beautiful 🤩🤩🤩❤️❤️❤️
Ryland please be careful with the Tiger Lilly plant you have in the snail planter as it’s really toxic for animals 🐕 🐈
Ryland is looking gorgeous in the video... he's glowing ❤
I love how Ryland up keeps the house, it’s sooo impressive!!! Specially cause they can probably afford someone to do it for them but he just enjoys doing it all, I love it!
In the summer going to Colorado sounds good and then in the winter go to LA. Honesty it’s a smart idea to have two houses if you can do it financially.
I love that this is 30 minutes.  I love you Ryan
You definitely need an outdoor rug!
Are we buying starbucks still????
That table was a choice
Ryland can you design my home someday!?!?
Oh my god.. i looooooooove your makeover vlogs ❤
As a fellow millennial, I can’t wait til ryland starts his vegetable/fruit garden era😂😂😂❤️💁‍♀️
Please look Into covers for all the furniture … and the roses :( 🥀 look for leaves of 3 cut right above that . Look up your plants and learn how to water , feed , prune . Look amazing
Please don’t ignore the Palestine 🇵🇸🤍 comments!!! Please educate yourself!! Use your platform!!
❤❤❤❤❤
Wow at 23:32 Ryland’s hair with that shadow makes it look sooo good. 1000% consider going darker!
Ohhh you bought lilies. Don’t let your cats outside in the courtyard.
Great job! Perfect area for the boys to enjoy the outdoors!
Your gardens are beautiful ❤
UH OH NOT THE STARBUCKS 💀
Uk girly hear and I love to see your stores ❤❤
Great looking front yard and courtyard! 💯🥰🌷🌺🌸🌼✨
I like the GOLDEN GOOSE SHOES 👟
Not the Starbucks 😬
Get a electric bubbling fountain
Hearing del taco gave me flashbacks to CapnDesdes 😂
I absolutely love your makeover of the courtyard and your lawn and gardens. Looks so beautiful. 😍❤
Gotta disagree with the Starbucks, Boba I like the blue raspberry flavor and the pop was cool.😅
Where's Shane's tiger shirt from?😍
your videos bring me so much joy Ryland! keep doing what your doing❤
The next patio tour is will toddlers toys and colorful water play stuff 🫶
LILLY FLOWER WARNING: they are toxic to dogs & even more to cats, if they eat the pollen strands that stick out. Always cut those once they come out. The petals are toxic as well but not as much as the pollen strands.
Wow house looks like new house outside 🏡 turned out so so good love it
lilies are toxic to cats- just in case they wander outdoors - FYI
5:33 I thought was editing these vlogs.
this was such a good vibe!!! :)
Shane looks healthier, skinnier and more confident. I love that for him and I’m happy to see him like that 🥲😊😊😊😊
As a fellow Taurus I am here for Ryland’s energy especially lately 🥳✨
I’d look into the Lillie’s being toxic to cats and dogs.. maybe want to replace those
You need a decorating show ❤
Hope you gifted the outdoor furniture to Lizzie or someone else who needs wants it
Happy Early Birthday Ryland
we need to see the babies in every vlog, ok!
Needs an outdoor rug!
Please stop with the edits. They are over the top, overstimulating and do not add anything to the videos. If anything, they take away from what you’re actually filming. Have been watching your videos for years. Your content was entertaining enough pre-baby. We are here to watch you, the edits are unnecessary
My biggest concern is Ryland using cleaning chemicals on the pool while IN the pool!! Great job though 🎉
Be careful with the lilies/ daylilies. They are toxic to pets!
Does anyone know what vlog cam this is?
This was so fun!!
💙💙
If u weren't a house wife u could be a landscaper no joke 😅
Are y'all speaking on Palestine or are y'all on the block list?
It looks SO good. And honestly it’s the best feeling when all that hard work pays off. It’s like you gave everything a facelift ✨
Super lovely. May you have many summer days outside.
The space looks great! I wish I had a quarter of Ryland’s vision and determination! I have so many ideas to optimize my living space, I get the things, and the my motivation and ADHD are like, “Think again sis!”
damn Ryland, you right after yoga wt that outfit and wet hair  is giving masc and youre so fkn hot. low key can imagine you linking wt someone from yoga lol you're just so sexy tbh also, would recommend furniture covers for your outdoor furniture to protect them from the elements.
Are you the only one that works so hard around there? I never see Shane helping you and by the way, please tell Shane he would look so much better if he would get a shave and a haircut.
Hey that looks great you did a great job!!
One more comment. The  yellow lilies in the snail is the perfect choice! I love it, I actually love everything Ryland did in the courtyard
I need a Ryland in my life!❤
You’ve done a great job Ryland, the front of your home does look beautiful, and the mountain behind your house is beautiful, I really appreciate it because I am living in Kentucky with just hills but I have family in California so I do make it out there sometimes. I think the horse should be a rich dark brown color with white spots or at least wipe down the center of his face. And the courtyard turned out really nice. Spring cleaning is a lot of work but it keeps the value of your home up. clean all spring and then enjoy the other three seasons, what am I saying house work never ends
THE FREQUENCY OF THE VLOGS 😭🥹❤️❤️ I’m living
There’s cats loving it!
Stunning!! It's so California, I love it❤
It's okay you don't like her album. Don't be bullied.
Don’t love how u are negative about Shane’s feelings it may not be what he loves or his thing but you can still be kind 😢
Yeah lots of sleep regression.
Great vlog. Makeover looks great.
I miss the Colorado house 😢
Some would say, “Taylor is a ‘Mastermind.’” 💙🤍
bird bath would look great in there
What about an outdoor rug?🫣🫣🫣
Ya know… most people with outdoor furniture cover it up or put it away when there’s bad weather or when it’s off season, so it doesn’t get ruined from rain and bad weather.
Ohhhh it’s beautiful!!! Ryland is literally the best🩷
Download wonder weeks. You’ll know when they’re going to be fussier with this app!
I forgive a lot about y’all but supporting Starbucks is just wrong. Do u guys really not know about boycotting Starbucks ☠️
I love the outcome. You're a born homemaker :)
I’ve been watching u for a while Ryland and I’ve really enjoyed ur content but it hurts me everytime yall support Starbucks. Please consider switching to a different coffee place.
Starbucks trying to be Dutch Bros with the boba
Ryland, it’s okay not to like Taylor swift music… don’t force yourself lol
But like, the Drake reference? 😅
I need a Ryland in my life!
I see you Freelee 😆
I love how it turned out ! I think black rock or mulch with spot lights on the trees would look so good out front and make the house and drive way pop also it would  last longer! But it look fab either way! ❤ maybe lights lining the drive way!
Stop did you guys see uno face, he getting so old it’s makings me sad
Ryland never sits still ❤
❤ beautiful  . One thing idk if the cats go outside, I dont think they do but lillies are toxic to cats
Throw away the lillies!! They are so so toxic to cats and dogs, even just the pollen
Love these life vlogs so much!!!
Shane always makes me laugh
My love !!!!! ❤
I love it!!!
PRESSURE washing the stones🪨 & or a GIANT outdoor carpet/RUG would tie the look together🪑I love Flowers🌻🥀 & outdoor LIVING
I ordered an umbrella and it also came without the base! 😮
Wow another one ! Great
I know I’m asking a lot, but please post your videos more often!!! I need them for my therapy
Good job Rayland!! you are such a visionary. The patio looks so good. I'm glad that huge umbrella worked out in the end. Can't wait for more of your videos.
Traders joes dark chocolate peanut butter cups are the best!!!
All of you complaining that these two aren’t supporting your cause or that they buy from a retailer, just stop watching! or at least quite complaining.  Some of us want to break away from stress and politics and just have a half hour to enjoy a video.   Read the room? Exactly! They have never been politely on their channels and I for one am grateful.  I understand all sides are important to certain populations. There’s enough place for all of you to watch that content on other formats.  Ryland and Shane- thank you for  sharing parts of your lives and allowing most of us a few minutes this week to experience your lives and smile. 💜
Love all the Taylor talk 🤭🤭🤭
I love TTPD sooo much!!! She is my queen
An outdoor patio rug might go well with the vibe. Good job on making your home beautiful ❤
plz bring me to taylor with u when shes back😭 its so hard to find tickets
Wow people this is supposed to be a fun watch, keep your political opinions out of it✌🏼
Outdoor rug!!
Lo
The entire lily plant is toxic to cats: the stem, leaves, flowers, pollen, and even the water in a vase, bestie please get rid of it 😭
Vet tech here! Lilly’s are toxic to pets :(
Just a tip careful with the yellow lillies they're poisonous to cats and dogs 😊
Who was the guy in the back?
"Feels full of hope" I love that❤
I appreciate you Ryland!! You're so good at everything seriously!!
I know you probably hear this all the time Ryland but genuinely when I see you posted I get a wave of happiness. I hope you know how much of an impact your content really makes on many of our days :)
waitttttt ryland with longer facial hair is GIVINGGGGGGG daddiiiii lol
Wish y’all and Trish would be friends again honest caring legit though
Hi Ryland! I never commented but just wanted to say love the vlogs and wanted to say the plants are beautiful but please make sure you get dog safe plants there is a lot of plants poisonous to animals. Just want to keep all the animals safe❤️
the amount of parkings in the us always shocks me
You should have the horse powder coated. That way it won’t wear off again.
You should break up the roots when you re-pot a plant, helps them spread out and grow healthy.
Ryland is just a nesting mama
Ryland cutting the plastic planter is killing me 😂 all you gotta do is squeeze around the plastic and the plant comes out. No cutting necessary lol but i gotta give props to Ryland doing EVERYTHING
I would have titled it, "Taylor Swift pranks me." and the vieeeeeeews. 😅
ryland you look highkey sooo good... maybe its the hair idk but go off you look amazing
Be super careful with the cats and the Lilly’s! Unfortunately they are super attracted to them and are very toxic! Can’t remember if you let the cats out anymore! ❤
Lilies are toxic to cats!  🐈
F*CK STARBUCKS FREE PALESTINE
Did you shock the pool before you jumped in??
LLLLOOOOOOVVVVEEEE!!! Great job hun!! It’s so beautiful! You did amazing! I love going through the process as with you and seeing all that effort bring you SO much joy!
i love u guys but u need to do better with your platform and stop promoting brands that support a genocide
BOYCOTT STARBUCKS!
Outdoor rug for under the couchhhh💕🤞🏼👌
5:23 when Uno is a cuck
Shane, how much weight have you lost?! You look great!
Boycot starbucks😢
The Starbucks summer drink, the only one that is good is with lemonade!!!!
ryland your mustache is so prominent rn you should shave for shane’s podcast and just have the mustache 😂😂
You are amazing  Ryland    you decorate so well I love it you and Shane are so cute together Love your Channel  Your house and yard are Beautful
Did anyone else know Ryland from Clevver before he was with Shane??
Your dreams have already came true. I miss the old way when did videos. Most of your videos are what you can buy.
when ryland says “girls” i just feel so loved like he knows me omg i’m included!! 😂
You can get baby jumping swinging for your boys and install them into studs for the patio
Love the Taylor clips edit ha 😍
Did you actually leave that tuna in the vehicle while you did all those errands 💀
Okay domesticated mama 💜
Shane had to have edited this with all the gifs and all the sounds. It’s so good
❤❤❤❤
You Ryland absolutely outdid yourself. Loved seeing you transform that patio! The umbrella ☂️ is everything!
Advice not asked for but just a simple tip.. you should try to be loud around your babies and not as quiet, it helps them sleep through more ❤️
Omgggg I love that you’re a Taurus!!! I will be 21 on the 18th this month so excited ❤️
Watching a shopping video with you cures my weekly stress. Good Job on the patio.❤
We need to know what Shane is doing work out wise and eating wise because I’m struggling and idk what todo and it would be great if Shane showed like what helped him lose weight because he looks amazing and healthy.❤️❤️
Ok but the edits are so fun.  AND Shane looks so good!!! He looks so happy and healthy!❤❤❤
Love u guys but I'll love u more when you paint the horse lol
What a beautiful patio!  Just an FYI, Lilies are deadly to cats so if they get out and chew on the leaves or injest any pollen they could die.  I just learned about this recently so I've gotten rid of all the lillies on our property.
❤❤❤
Honey we canceling Taylor swift you didn’t hear ? Blockout celebs who don’t support #gaza
Love the hair and patio area Ryland ❤️🤍💙
CAREFUL! Do not let the dogs around that yellow Lilly!! It’s hella toxic
Fabulous!
Ryland in his spring cleaning era! This made me want to go work on the mess of my garage
Yeezys really?
Ryland stating "Wow this is going to take a lot of my problems away" while cleaning the pool is my thoughts when I stress clean ha ha
@rylandvlogs you know what would make the space absolutely POP. power wash that beautiful terracotta looking tile patio floor. your eye for design is always so inspiring. love the transformation.
Babes, you need to consider talking about P*stine, celebs, influencers, tiktokers and youtubers are being blocked left right and centre for not using their platform to speak out about JennySide. Love y'all
Looks like someone attached two bra pads to a pair of orthopedic socks.
Man Ryland can you come and give Me some ideas. Please!  Amazing!!!
boycott starbucks! FREE PALESTINE!!!!
Ryland!! I saw you got Lillie’s PLEASE be careful they’re deathly toxic to cats
Ryland! ❤️ I do recommend getting outdoor furniture covers so that your furniture stays protected during the rough weather months + prevents sun fading on the cushions.  When you have company over or you decide to hang out outside remove the covers and your furniture will look brand new! ✨ Love the vlogs always, thank you! 💌

i love this editing
I am loving your hair! 😊
The teletubbies sun edit made me laugh 😂😂
Agreed the summer berry drinks aren't all that. So I make mine with lemonade and the syrup from the  "fish eggs." 😂😂 It really makes a world of difference. 😁
I'm a Taurus
Love the make over!
Be careful with lillies!! They are gorgeous but can be super toxic for dogs and cats!
You have become quite the homemaker!!
❤❤❤
You should paint the horse yellow
I've said it before ryland again and again.. BECOME A PROFESSIONAL INTERIOR DESIGNER!!!!
Wow Ryland you outdid yourself girl 😊 yesssss it looks beautiful 🌹🌷🌸🏵️
I’m so glad I’m not the only one who thought the Starbucks drinks had no flavor 😂 The boba themselves was good tho
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Starbucks and Kanye in one video! Yikes
Omg we go to the same corepower! I wont say where❤
The lilies,.as.pretty as they are, are.toxic for the cats.
Ya'll do realize at some point you and shane have to take the boys out the house together both boys at one time to stores and the park even though they are still so little you can get on a swing and lightly swing that way the baby is still in tiny motion and getting fresh air
I loveeee ur decorating videos❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ryland posts the reveal timestamp like anyone wants to skip to it 😂 um nooo! We shall watch from beginning to end & sometimes all over again at a later time 😂 Porch looks FAB! 🌞
Don’t get me wrong but Shane can help even if he doesn’t want to…
Why would you buy anything from Kanye west?
ALL EYES ON RAFAH, FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸
Rylan, can you show us what camera you’re using? It’s so cool that it moves and follows your face.
You did an amazing job with the patio!
Send the horse out to be refurbished and come back with a surprise
Love your videos ❤
You should put the umbrella by your pool
Ryland after yoga 😥❤️‍🔥
Shane: "I like beach"  SHANE IS THE NEW KEN! 😆
We need too see the courtyard at night!!
Also some outdoor furniture covers
am i the only one who thinks the quality of this video is a bit much? there’s too much going on (edit wise)😭😭
you need to get a wagon to get your packages cute and functional queen
I was like: Should I watch my nerdy space video or Ryland's vlog?  Ryland's vlog, duh!
I love your Vlogs, however i disliked this video because you guys still support Starbucks 🍉
Ryland! Why not buy some furniture covers for the more delicate stuff? D:
That pool is soo dirty😂
you should get an outdoor rug!
Uno just watching the lesbian porn unfolding in front of him🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for sharing! Loved this video <3
Great job!
Omg… justice for those Starbucks drinks… you must have gotten a bad one because I’ve gotten them twice and I can’t believe how tasty they are?!?! Plz go through the drive thru on the sip
Ryland you should get a solar powered fountain to have a water feature. No cords required!
Awe Ryland !!the patio looks great !! Love the umbrella ❤
Don’t over water those palms . Be sure to feed them palm food  and if you give the leaves a light spray every day they will think they are living in humidity and grow crazy good ..
how good are the RX bars??? ive always wanted to buy them but i dont know if it will be worth it
Love the vlogs but Ryland yes that was a male black widow. Males tend to be smaller and have whites sports on their abdomen’s.
I saw the notification at work and clicked on it immediately! Btw, I LOVE THE HAIRCUT RY!!! 😍
I loved this video.
Wow!! Great job! I can totally see a water feature in the middle. Maybe one day.
I love ryland’s little home projects ❤
Ryland never runs out of energy. That metabolism is insane! lol
Some outdoor rugs would make a huge difference! You can just spray them off when they get dirty
Just be careful with Lillies, because they are highly toxic to cats and pets.
What about a solar fountain?
Look ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL,  great job  😃😃😃  love u
For all the large packages you could try driving your car to the gate and loading everything in your car. 😊
What about your house and alpacas in Colorado ?
You are a beast with the yardwork!
Shane it looks like you lost weight. And you look healthier and happier. Good for you! You look great. ❤
I love your decorating videos. You did a great job! I just want to say out of concern, the Lilies are highly toxic to dogs. Just be careful with your fur babies around the lilies. ❤️
Ryland makes me smile. I run around every spring and summer cleaning and primping my yard, garage and patio. Nobody seems to think it’s important but then we get endless compliments and they all take the credit. 😂
What's going on with Colorado?  Will you go back there soon?
So we’re not boycotting Starbucks ?
The strawberry boba is better at Dutch bros. Strawberry lemonade with boba ♥️
Hi Ryland! Love the patio however I did see you planted LILLiES in the snail planter! 😮 lilies are highly toxic to both cats and dogs, with as little as one or two molecules of pollen being enough to cause liver failure in cats!! For the safety of your precious fur babies you should definitely trade out the lilies for a safer plant, such as zinnias or snapdragons❤  Edit: spelling
Starbucks and Kanye in the same video... yikes
The courtyard is gorgeous
✌️💚✌️💚
Awesome vlog.  Love you two…4
Am I the only person that gets a terrible headache everytime I drink a can of flavored sparkling water?
You didn’t include your balcony! Can’t wait to see what you do with it
Look up the wonder weeks. Babies go through leaps at certain times and its hell for us parents lol
Taylor Swift’s music is soooo dull and boring, sorry not sorry.
love u guys so much, i enjoy watch ur videos IMMEDIATELY as they come out… but, supporting starbucks? idkkkkk , it’s not the t
PSA - please keep ALL types of Lilly’s away from your pets!!!!!! They are hugely poisonous!!!! Even if they lick a leaf it can cause life threatening issues. 😢
No Colorado? :(
lilys are EXTREMELY toxic to cats so make sure they don’t get anywhere near em. 🥺💛 i know they’re not outside cats but just in case yall didn’t know! also i’m about to move into my first townhome so this is giving me so much excitement and ideas for the little patio we’re about to have!! 🏡
Ryland is beautiful.  Now can you come do my back yard. ❤😂. Great job
Hi I live right down the street from you I would be glad to take your patio furniture off your hands😂❤
Serious question. Why does anyone support Kanye? Really tho
Trim your roses at the point above the 5 green leaves. Most usually they will put out two more roses in that spot. Don’t just lop off the bloom. Look down the stem until you see 5 leaves and cut just above it.
Do you think you will sell your Colorado house?
Please be careful with potting mix, you need to wear a mask and gloves, otherwise you can get legionnaires' disease. This has been your public service announcement.
I NEED THAT 1st OUTDOOR SET!! What is that store and do they deliver to Connecticut
House makeovers keep Ryland sane
Wow Ryland fantastic job on the patio and house spruce up. The idea with the tree that you found growing in the pot, putting flowers in it and bringing it on to the patio - I love it. The roses are gorgeous!
I LOVE the table! I like the fact that its a muted shade of green!
Your hair is killing it in the vlog
I like Shane but it was nice to watch a vlog that he didn't take over and make about him. I have missed this type of Ryland's vlogs
These vlogs bring me so much joy 🥰
Are youever going back to Colorado
These vlogs bring me so much joy , why? Who knows who cares I love it ❤️ thanks you guys for the glimpse into your day~
Be careful, some palms are very TOXIC for pets!!
You have a golf cart!!!!
Lily’s are so poisonous for dogs and cats
Looks gorgeous!! My fav videos are the decoration ones ❤️ also just a reminder, if you let the cats outside, Lillies are very poisonous to them. Love you guys and y'all are looking great!
Polar is the best seltzerrrrrr! Cranberry lime polar will change your life 🤪
My god, buying so much stuff and redoing spaces all over again multiples times in a short period of time is just crazy...your life seems so boring, you must be so dead inside...
dont be hard on yourself about the babes crying, as long as they're healthy, fed, cleaned and safe then its okay to step away for a moment and let them have a cry... and when they do cry know its not your fault! No dad guilt! You two are doing the very best you can as new dads.
Tayor Swift is the devil's daughter
The reveal is giving MTV cribs and I’m loving it! Ryland u have such good taste😍
I absolutely LOVED this video!!! Ryland, you did an amazing job!!! What I did in a day are my favorites 🤩Thanks for sharing 😘
Yay !! I love your remodeling videos 😍🔥💯 super talented
I love the courtyard makeover! There are solar water feature options that you might like.
Your energy is contagious:) you make me want to get off my butt and do stuff I’ve been putting off ❤
Ryland literally does more around the house than my straight bf lol it look awesome!
Omg looks so amazing !!
Love it and it looks sooo much better!!!Great job!!!
Love watching these renovation deck vlogs!!! So fun ❤️ keep posting updates and you guys out there hanging out when it’s done
Surprise Shane with Dutch Bro's their located in the city of Orange County
supporting companies with their hands in a genocide isn't a good look bb
Rylan paint the horse a really pretty blue so Shane can have the color of the ocean 🌊😀
Shane has really trimmed down, good for him.
Does Shane ever do anything around the house!!??
I actually really like the umbrella colors. looks like it matches well on the patio.
I love ur content but I literally can’t support people who support a company that has a hand in the Gaza tragedy.
I swear you get more handsome each video!
Ewww oatmeal.
Lilies are toxic to cats …. Please make sure they don’t go near that
Ghost writers Ryland… that’s how Taylor does it
Sunday Shane Monday Ryland. Why are we sooo  blessed. We have the Sip too 🥲🥹
Happy so birthday Rylan 🎉🎁🎉 I hope you have a magical birthday 💐🎂
Add an outdoor rug and muah! Chefs kiss!!
Gah, that store had cats in it 😻
OMG Ryland! 🕷😳😱
I’m guessing there’s a new editor, it’s doing too much
Happy early birthday Ryland
Just stain the table it that easy 😂
Was it fun or was it nerve-wracking to travel with the twins for @Ryland Vlogs? Just curious; love y'all! ❤
The big umbrellas might work in the back by the pool
Rylan please give the horse a makeover ❤️ it's looking sad 😢
Great video love it ❤
Wheel barrow would make it easier
Watching people decorate their homes and gardens while being in an almost empty home is depressing 😂 but gives me ideas on what to do with it and some what motivation.   The fireplace and sofa is gorgeous. He’s so good at decorating and making areas look so nice. 😊
I didnt love the new Starbucks drink with coconut milk but the lemonade refresher SLAPSSSSSS
Good job Ryland, it’s gorgeous.
Looks amazing! you should ger a lemon tree for the courtyard to complete the look!
"prepare the bark"💀
I still like the Colorado house WAY more.
Maybe I don’t have enough B12 but how do Ryland have energy to take care of twins a husband vlog and decorate wtf
imagine being able to see taylor 4 times😭😭 i got scammed trying to see her once.
Beautiful things outside speak to you because you’re a Taurus hunny 🩵 us earth signs love that shit
Ryland, I noticed on Shane's podcast & also in this vlog that your hair looks awesome; whatever hair routine ya got going is working well. Sending love from Massachusetts! 😘
clicked off as soon as i saw starbucks. STARBUCKS IS FUNDING A GENOCIDE. IF YOU BUY YOU FUND ASWELL
❤ video
The front of your home looks like a high end resort! So beautiful! 😍 I can only imagine how much the boys would love to eat their meals out on the patio with you! Great job!!!
Be careful with the lilies and your cats, they are extremely toxic even just a little pollen
Okay but the editing in this is EVERYTHING!!!!!!
I could watch ryland decorate and do room makeovers everyday 😻
Treat yourself
thank you ryland i love you youre videos are a blessing
RYLAND...babe...you have gray hair!!! So cute! Dad on the run and winning!🎉
The Colorado house was so much nicer
Gary is looking cute with his yellow flowers
I admire how much patience and dedication Ryland has to assemble/deep clean things . I could never bitch .. I get flustered setting up a coffee machine
Ryland you are a GET IT DONE GURL after my own heart. RU's You better Werk insert said it all. Bravo! I was hoping you didn't walk by a set that made you question all your choices as well.❤
the wisteria lane music for the roses 💀
Package wagon
Shane is glowing!!! I love it!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
24:31 do u have any idea what kind of rose bushes those are? Theyre gorgeous😍
The toxic masculinity of Ryland frequently claiming to be mom/girl/woman is unbearable. You have not earned it, you make that crystal clear when you casually call Taylor Swift a bitch.  It's not cute, or funny how you trampe all over a woman, only to turn atound and call yourself a woman. Do better. This is not ok
❤❤
For real 😮 Starbucks has gone down 👎 💯
I love the blogs and appreciate you making time to post them. Just PLEEEEEAAAAASE stop going to and supporting Starbucks. Outside how problematic they’ve been in the Israeli genocide, they treat their workers so poorly and actively work against them unionizing.
I feel bad for u ryland is love shane but dam he is lazy hahahahah u do everything
Wait Shane looks kinda….
hear me out…solar water feature ❤
Same
SHANE! SIR! You are a skinny legend! Ryland, your pride in your homes is inspirational and your eye for design is GOALS! Ty for the glimpse of your little one. I know you didn't have to but I loved that you did. ❤
Get couch covers and move them under the outdoor ceilings after season. They'll last❤
I feel like the courtyard still needs an outdoor rug and some pop-of-color pillows (especially yellow) that match the flowers to tie it all in? Otherwise its just a wee barren, but still very lovely. <3
I love the outdoors too! Looks beautiful ❤
do u like espresso by sabrine
i LOVE the editing! so fun!
Ryland growth spurts. Every couple months they will go through growth spurts and they will get grumpy then level out then get grumpy again then level out. Welcome to parenthood lol
Hot yoga! Love it.
Im JUST curious WHAT Ryland did to the upstairs balcony that he cleaned off in the LAST???? Video I was hoping to see an 'extension' of the patio carried on from up there but I guess NOT LOL
It looks sooo good Ryland!!! I'm super jelly belly now I feel like I need to get off my butt and get my front garden and entry way cleaned up for the year 😮❤
i just know i’m gonna be THAT wife haha always excited about the home projects while my husband sits back like “girl do ur thing” hahaha i love this🥺🖤
love your vlogs, keep up like that ryan, and im so happy for you 4!
i dislike bobas, i like to either eat or drink, but not both
Ryland this editing is everything and is so funny!!
Ryland I love you and always can’t wait for a new video
I love the videos but I have arachnophobia so warn a person sometime that was so scary
Does Shane ever help you with any of the housework or yard work? I say this as someone who loves Shane. I just notice that you do a lot by yourself in these vlogs.
You're so freekin adorable ❤
RYLAND: do you treat your roses with anything to keep bugs off? Specifically rose slugs? I gave up on roses because it was constantly fighting with those suckers
You are HILARIOUS   "vlogging in public alone, I hate it 🫤" 😂
You should paint the horse white and make it an art project with boys! Maybe hand print and paint with a weather proof top coat
You're in your element when you redesign a space!! 😍
take a shot everytime ryland says curb appeal 😂😂😂❤
Do you guys plan on going back to your Colorado house this year
The patio looks amazing! However please reconsider the lilies, your pets are likely to experience eye irritation at the least, and fatal toxicity at the worst! Much love ❤
Nooooo Ryland not you mentioning drake in the seat geek promo 😭
Looks good! I love spending as much time outside as we can. I'd suggest a fold away playpen fence and a good picnic blanket with waterproof bottom or durable playmat. You could put the playpen up when babies get mobile but for now just the playmat/picnic blanket under your shade umbrella for the boys. You can bring out their bouncers or the standing toy you got recently. Babies thrive with outside time too. ❤️
Beautiful reveal Ryland ❤ just wanted to make sure you know that lilies are very toxic to dogs and cats, just want to make sure your babies are safe! Much love to your family
I know here in Canada, Amazon will  pickup returns from your house!
Who caes !!!!!!!!
What happened to the catio thing you made?
I'm  so impressed firl😊
Yeezys are so friggin UGLY...sorry guys. I love you tho! lol
I miss the old house 😭
Ryland baby why don't you become a personal decorator? You have such a good sense of taste
Are you doing yoga😂😂😂😊
Look for a solar water feature!
I'm going to see Alanis Morissette,  Bush, 311 and Motionless in White.  Concert season for me❤
Please talk about palestine🇵🇸
my sister works at that albertsons and sees u guys all the time and she’s autistic, very socially afraid of certain situations so she won’t ask u guys for pictures or anything😭😭the way im so jealous of her being that close but also so mad for not crying and throwing up FOR me🥺🤣🤣
Shane looks so good dude
Great job Ryland, it all looks AMAZING!!!
Thicc legs= 😍 Well done on that courtyard, Ryland!
Also it looks amazing ryland!!!!
You’re my favorite and calm me down! I’m graduation going full time and turning 21 this helped so much thank u!!! Love ur guys happiness and videos
Rylands hubby /dad is showing is here and I’m living for it , looks incredible! ❤
I love Rylands optimism for summer but it’s just not me either lol.
I feel the same way about the new album. I didn't love it at first but it's wearing on me!!
Looks so good! Don’t forget leave room for the boys water activities 😊
The best part of my week!!
The best gift you could’ve ever given us as long time viewers was half hour episodes 😭💖
Put a bag of shock in your pool while filter is running... will help tremendously ❤
Great job! Inspired me to remodel mine as well
Awwww I love these new chill hang out vlogs. Great work on the yard ❤
Lillies are deadly for kitty cats. the water the pollen, every part of them. Your out door areas look fabulous!
Erewan is so expensive and extremely boujee.
Those roses look incredible 🌹
Looks great. FYI babies and toddlers love being outside. A little outdoor playpen with shade will be great for family time.
Ryland is the husband everybody wants. Lol
Courtyard looks gorgeous and you both look great 💕
You should research wonder weeks! For the babies ❤
So...bout the horse, I had an idea for a new birthday tradition for Max and Jet.  Paint the horse white, like choke white, and stamp their feet and hands on it every birthday till they can draw or write. Just saying. It would be so cool when they see this all grown. luv yall from brazil
Your editing is really good!!
even though it wasn’t a black widow it was still an fucking ugly spider
The horse looks like it went to war and is bleed everywhere lol
Ryland i’ve been watching all these years just to realize rn im not subscribed.. I’m rlly sorry
Awesome job. You worked really hard and it shows. You need to get your pool water up to snuff. The tiles won't get the algae once the water is clean. It will be bright blue and add so much more to the look. 💖🥂
You take so much pride in your homes. It's amazing to watch ❤
Love the decorating vlogs!! House looks so nice ❤
Best purchase we ever made was a Sodastream! The Spindrifts weren’t good, the Waterloo line is one of the best.
pleaseeee stop adding those awful slurping and swallowing sounds when you guys try food. the misophonia of it all 😥😩😩
3:07 Grabbing all the boxes on the dolly to avoid making two trips while everything is turning into a disaster and falling is so real😅
Rylands got a huge talent on hard work transforming a space
shane should help out more
Ryland is putting so much Work into the house I really apllaude you Also thank you fit being real that Erewon is just outrageously overpriced
I know I’m gonna get attacked but I like rylands vlogs of Shane more than the podcast. If Shane likes the podcast it needs more excitement
You've really done a great job on the house Ryland.  Every little touch is just beautiful 😍 🌹🌸🌼🌻🌴
It looks great!!
U did a great job Rylan see anything can be done even with two adorable twins wish we could see a updated pic of the babies I have two twin granddaughters
Lilies are toxic to cats.
I will be so freakin happy when people quit talking about Taylor Swift, I’m so sick of her!
Loving the new haircut ✨✨
wish I lived in the valley so we could be mom friends
i get such bad fomo too with furniture shopping its like some weird OCD thing
Looks bootiful!  I love it!  Happy to see you both!
Ryland!!! Loved this vlog. 🎉
Yeah whenever you post anything I have to watch within the first 3hrs cuz it killlllllssss me to wait ❤
Absolutely fantastic Ryland,  you are very talented,  anything you do always turns out beautiful
I think you need to change the tiles girl~
Mini casa bonita ❤
The patio looks great ❤
U need a proyector for the patioo
It's absolutely beautiful, just like your entire family 🥰
Looks beautiful! But please be careful with lilies, specially that low.. theyre super toxic to dogs and cats ❤❤
Looks great enjoy
Ryland, you may be able to use a solar powered fountain for your water feature. Just a thought. Looks great!
You've ALMOST given me the motivation I'm lacking to get my yards and garden and such going.....ALMOST. It's already in the mid 80's where I am in Washington 😮‍💨...Kind of makes it hard to want to be outside!
Great Job Ryan❤ looks awesome
Ryland this is another win! Gorgeous work
Lillies are toxic to cats
Just a heads up lilles are toxic to dogs and deadly to cats .
Finally the boba!!!!!🧋
Love TTPD 🖤
I was hoping they'd be taking the boys back to Colorado now that the winter is over, but I do still love a Ryland Renovation!
For carrying package buy you a gorilla cart . They hold a lot of weight and easy to put to together.
Suggestion, 2-4 more outdoor dining chairs. Or a bench chiaifor the other side -- it looks too bare
Can’t wait to get home and watch this in cute lounge wear. It was a rainy day in Houston today and I keep falling asleep at work.
You just get it done Ry!! I love that you’re not a lazy bum 😂😍❤
I love you guys but why is Shane never helping you with anything?
Anyone else click the like button before watching??
Ryland why don't you seal your furniture  - The company I saw is called Flex Seal, check them out for your outdoor furniture! { Not sponsored**🤣}
Please tell me you killed that spider😭😭😭😭😭
Aren’t we boycotting Starbucks?
If you don’t get rid of that horse…*shakes fist*
My 60 year old mom just watched your vlogs, she LOOOVESSS what you did with you patio! Haha she was joking saying how she would hire you because you have the best eye for outdoor decore
“look at my lesbian dogs” “two women” I CANTTTT
Fabulous! The lawn does look so fresh and lush 🥰
I watch anything you & Shane post & since I’ve already done that (more than 2xs 😂 ♥️🥰) I’m now also watching Lizzie, Jerad,&rest of the family! Be Blessed 🙏🏻
Add a bench to the other side of the table!
Can we see the patio in the evening?😊😊
I love when Ryland vlogs 🙏🏻😁😁😁
I just love this type of vlogs
I miss Colorado videos….
You really are doing the gardener's job...
❤
Lol Ryland ain't nobody going to see drake.
I love your Designing vlogs!! ❤❤❤
LOVE YOU SO MUCH RY RY, THANK YOUUUUUU
All eyes on Rafah 🇵🇸
Your babies are probably going through growth spurts, also known as Leaps! There’s an app called “The Wonder Weeks” and it will notify you of upcoming leaps, what to expect, tips, and what new developments they’ll make! 1000/10 the best app I had when my daughter was a baby! ❤
Okay I adore you guys and your vlog but I have misophonia like Shane and I’m having a hard time with these added slurps and chews 😅
Starbucks?? Really???
I personally am obsessed with your post yoga hair 😮 did you blow dry it in the gym it looks great
I love your vlogs but the sound effects are quite distracting and annoying
Oh wow, you’re not going back to Colorado this summer?!
As a Taurus girly myself, I am NOT an outside person. 😂
Ok the girl comment is getting old
so Taurus and Cancer coded.
Ryland FaceTime your mom 😊
I love your vlogs and i love watching you guys. I just wish you guys didn’t support companies like starbucks because of the boycott happening since they support the genocide of Palestinians.
I don't want to sound negative, really, because the patio looks beautiful, but why are we doing all this for the L. A. house? What's happening with Colorado? I'm worried you'll never go back or sell it. Shouldn't matter; wherever you live is your business, I just love the Colorado house so much. 😭 (And HATE Los Angeles.)
crying because i remember when you first setup that outdoors area 😭
Hey Ryland, loved this makeover! these are my type of videos. Would you mind sharing the link for the outdoor lights you used?
I’m here for it 😍
Fav couple of all time! These videos keep me out of depression 😅
Starbucks Barista here 💕  I think they made the base wrong. It's supposed to taste like blue raspberry and the skies drink is supposed to taste like a rocket popsicle.  I'm sorry you had a bad experience 😔
What do you think about a patio carpet under the patio table
The courtyard and front yard look absolutely gorgeous!! You did such an amazing job on it, Ryland!! Also, happy early birthday, Ryland!! ❤🥰🎉
greats tips. i think you did great choices. the space looks amazing. i just probably throw away the horse, even painted is too much. maybe don't have in front of the house. you don't have a ranch with horses. maybe a dog statue would be better to warn people you have dogs. you both look amazing. have a great spring
Oooo tip for ya lol if you get some green and not ripened bananas and ripe ones they won’t go bad and won’t run out just a thought lol
You're making these few hard days so much better... Just seeing you and Shane happy makes me happy too... My "comfort show" for sure!! ❤
Your hair looks so good ryland!!!
stop supporting israel
Can we talk about how you support a genocide by purchasing from Starbucks.
I would love to see more videos like this but understand you have babies and it’s hand full
Looks beautiful! Hard work paid off!❤
Omg a big rug would honestly tie it all together?!? 😮😮😮😮😮
I always think about what Shane is doing while you’re doing all this stuff. Lol
Cleaning the pool while in it is immensely unintelligent and 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Mulch ? Maybe bark is something else in cali lol
I live for all your makeover content ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I had thought the patio was going to pretty much look the same but wow it looks more alive and just friendly now all he need is to do the backyard 😭lol
Kanye and Starbucks. Hm🍉
Like the shoe socks ! And wash easily nice
The lesbian scene was my favorite lol 😂
My new favorite mommy vlogger🥰🥰💗
Whole Foods and Trader Joe's should be renamed "Robbery for Food"
You need those little shade sheets to hang over the areas in the courtyard you want shaded  you could shade the whole thing if you wanted to instead of the little umbrellas 😊
I love that you put all your items together yourself and it’s a great feeling ! Happy for you  so wonderful  I wish I could do all that so much it’s amazing!!! Go Ryland ! ❤
It doesn’t look green at all of the camera accurately depicts the colour ?
I love shane, i really really do but he kind of rains on Rylands parade ALOT
Looks lovely Ryland! Well done! Happy Birthday 🎉 🎂
The patio looks awesome, I know I would enjoy it. I wish I had a pool, but I don't own a house but I have a cute little patio.
Shane looks so skinny!
Spindrift... How could you not. But I stick to the simple flavors, Lemon and Grapefruit. Plus Gardener Ryland ...
I love the first umbrella! The outside looks great! 🌵 ☀️ 🌺
If you want to extend the life of your patio furniture, buy covers, for everything. My cushions are waterproof, they still get covered.
Is Ryland getting a dad belly?   Cuuuute. 😉
I just love the excitement of a new makeover! Your designs are so Beautiful! Great job❤❤
I looove how your hair looks when you put sunglasses on ur head
It looks so good girly amazing job with everything on the house 🏠
Any “makeover” content is my FAVORITE! ❤️
I get so freaking excited when I see that you post.... love the court yard.. the boys will be able to chill out there with you and in a few months put their walkers out there and enjoy!
I love how happy Shane is in this vlog :)
Anything Ryland and Shane I’m watching!! 💗💗
the yellow flowers are very dangerous to cats,  every part of that plant ( Lilly) including the pollen are poisonous to cats.
🙌🌹😮 so lovely ☺️ 24:33
I’ve noticed in a few of your vlogs you’ve said gluten bothers your stomach. That is a huge sign of celiac disease, which isn’t something people are typically tested for. I recommend you talk to a doctor and get tested as if you leave it untreated it could result in a lot of serious things (which I’ll let you look up). Idk I just felt it was important.
Amazing job Ryland  it's absolutely gorgeous!! 😍  You're so hired!!!!!💯 Lol  😏👍🏼💕
Am i the only one that cant stand the slurping noise sound affect in any channel. But i cant stand it in real life. I try to ignore it but sometimes HARD! lol.
I agree on your Taylor Swift stance, there are a few funsies in there tho Daddy I love Him is growing on me
It all looks so fresh and relaxing!!! Great job Ryland!!! Shane- I’ll have what you are having cause you are looking great!!! 🥰♥️☀️☀️
Starbucks big sucks - let’s never order from them again 😂
Please be careful with the lilies! They are extremely toxic to cats so make sure the kitties don’t get to them
The Starbucks drinks are always bad, might as well support local coffee shops and not a company under a boycott.
Is it just me or are the vlogs too short 😵‍💫 I love longer content nowadays!! Leave it all in even if it seems boring to the vlogger I promise most viewers enjoy it! >time stamps help as well<
Not relating to TTPD just means you've head a very easy, heartbreakless life 😅 And that's ok, blessed be lol
Ryland you should add a big outdoor rug in the area in front of the swinging bench. It would really liven up the space!
Lillies are deadly to animals! Be careful
Just tried those new boba drinks at SB and i agree with Shane! Yucks
You need a baby foam mat for outside .. really nice for the boys and easy to clean for you!! I have two under two and slips are so easy to clean
"My end table that you're sitting on comes tomorrow. Well, you're sitting on the old table." 🤣🤣🤣
Buying refrigerated food and THEN going to 2-3 stores after that is a bold move.
Disappointed in yall still supporting Starbucks 👎🏼👎🏼
You should check out the developmental leap schedule. It adds some reassurance to the hard times. 😮‍💨
Your pool water is green…..😳
Aww, i wanna see theboys rolling around in their walkers all roind the courtyard. Its so nice and so fresh, i would be out there with them every second i could.
Those lilies on your patio be careful they are highly toxic to cats even just the pollen
Our birthday is tomorrow🎉
Ryland you look so handsome in this video! Great haircut.
I remember the 1st time you remodeled the patio it was beautiful can't wait to see what u did this time
The editing was so funny in this one 😂
A lot of Lillie’s are toxic to dogs and cats. Maybe choose a different plant
Ryland chopping the flowers in the zebra hat made me laugh and I don’t know why 😂
Those bouts of crankiness could be grown spurts. My boys did the same thing and that's what their doctor told me. You two are doing an amazing job.
i just love you Ryland.!
HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY RYLAND 🎉WE ARE BIRTHDAY TWINS!! 🥳
The table is the dress all over again
Ok you are just all willy nilly with the rose cutting. There is a process to it. So roses if you look at the stalk/branch there are growth lines much like the knuckles in your fingers. You want to look at the stalk and find the knuckles with a small bud starting just above the knuckle. Above being towards the sky. Then cut just below that knuckle. Their is also a directional function going on there. Certain directions you cut (angles) will cause the next growth to go out away from the main stalk of the rose bush and some cuts cause growth inward towards that main stalk. That is important if you want height or you want thickness. Steer clear of thickness near walkways bc... Thorns and babies don't mix.
You did absolutely amazing sweetie! Much love from Sydney Australia xxo❤❤
I appreciate the quality of these vlogs it gets better with every vlog.
I fucking hate that drinking sound. It makes me nauseous every time I hear it. It’s horrible. First time I ever heard it was Ryan trahan. If he started this trend he needs to be punished. Lol
When the lilys die out take the bulbs and plant them in the yard partial sun. They will multiply like crazy
It's great! The only thing I'd add would be some throw pillows for pops of color.
Shane is a got dayummm kill joy! It is beautiful Ryland!! Awesome job 👏 👍 🙌 👌
I know your daddy's now but I so miss your vlogs I absolutely love them so when I see a new one I'm all over it I really enjoy them but I get busy life miss you guys so much not many vlogs anymore glad to watch this one much love to your family ❤
Is shanes tshirt of the gorilla that people got obsessed with from the podcast :') dead
Where are your shorts from that you’re wearing while fixing up the courtyard / patio area?
It’s a great day when Ryland uploads a vlog! 🎉
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Loved this ❤️ 💖 ♥️ 👏
I know , you guys don’t have Dutch there unfortunately but they also have boba drinks
Unpopular camera opinion…when it starts to follow your faces I get the worst motion sickness. Thankfully this video only had a few SHORT moments 😅
Its beautiful! Plus your roses make me so happy!
Ryan in the car after his workout out 🤪 he looked so straight and hot with his hair all wavy and sweaty. Ok Shane you did that!
ryland i saw you buying lillies please watch out with them for the animals they are toxic 🥲
Your editor needs to chill with the sound effects RyRy
Ryland, I’m sorry, but this moving camera is not it 😭 Ik It was expensive, but I’m dizzy…😂😭
Outdoor furniture.... Metal and glass ends that problem. If you must have wood then you need to not purchase particle board. It absorbs water and misshapes. Solid wood still does that but it does it directionally with the grain. So a solid piece of wood does it the same direction meaning you will have to add a water protector to it or repaint it every 4 or 5 years. You won't have to throw it out though.
I'm not sure if you let your cats outside or not but the yelllow lillies you have in the snail pot are toxic to cats
Ryland you make me believe I can do everything you just did on my own, but in reality I really can’t lol. It looks like so much fun but it’s soooo hot in Texas that I just can’t. I want to be an outdoor girly so bad. I just got some outdoor patio furniture so maybe I can start there. Thank you for the motivation!
You need to put some annuals in some of those pots.The lily that is in the snail will stop blooming in another week.  There’s a brand of petunias called super bells by proven winners. These plants are amazing and they will bloom as long as you don’t get a hard freeze. If you fertilize them every week, they’ll bloom even more!!  They are available a variety of colors.
Lovely 😊
Buying yeezy AND starbucks in the same video??? Yikes
Yay watching on my lunch break ❤❤🎉
Dangggg shane! You look amazingggggg❤❤❤
Love it! I was just out cleaning my front yard. 🤭😁
Girl, we’re boycotting Starbucks. Come on….
Wait till they start teething omg that was the worst for me but it went quick so thank god
Ryland, the court yard looks gorgeous!! Be careful though, the yellow lilies are poisonous to animals.
The editing always kills me 😂 Ryland as the Sun lmfao  Ps can I make a suggestion/request…? Can you post the vlogs on the alternating week of Shane’s podcast so we have some content every week from both of you 😇
With flower coordination. Pick a color you like. Then pick other flowers that have a different color but also have some of the original color choice also in it. For Cali I would probably go with sunset or flame colors as a base. Otherwise known as red, orange and pink. Any of those colors opens up tons of secondary and 3rd flower options. Plus you can do a moon garden blended in so you have something flowering to look at in the dark. Moon gardens are typically white and dark purples
the horse. 😂
Damn Ryland, You did a fantastic job! Enjoy that Cali summer! The space looks spectacular. WOW.
the editing was so extra this video, I love it LOL
Lilys are toxic to pets, just be careful.
Ryland you did an amazing job ❤️ gonna be so nice to have the babies out there to relax!! and al fresco meals are such a small luxury to have throughout your day. Thank you for including the reveal in this video!!
lmao what does shane do at all to help everyday 😂😂😂🤔🤔
I love outdoor spaces, plus it adds anotber room to the house. Gorgeous, Rylan.
Ryland, I LOVE the finished product. You have such a eye for design. I cannot tell you how I'd buy LITERALLY everything if you ever have your own home decor line...Im speaking that into existence right now! Much love and light always darling
Your home is beautiful! Great job!
Where can I get some of that energy?😊
I call those rough phases. Growing pains. 🥰
Lil pro tip, fill the base of the umbrella with sand because it doesn’t evaporate
Would be nice if he stopped calling women bychs like its cute. But I doubt he can see how that affects women. The more I watch the podcast the more I see Ryland is grossly stereotypical perhaps even misogynist. Always calling woman btch and heck wont even say vagna just goes straight to psy this and pssy that. And more. Like women are dirty vile creatures to him. Gay men always get a pass for talking to us or about us in that sort of language. Its horrible the words he uses and how people just act like it's normal and just a cute phrase because they themselves do it. When it's disrespectful as heck and just adds to the bs mindset we have to deal with. For a guy that constantly calls himself girl, woman, mother.... ick. I used to like him but this just solidified my annoyance. Any woman who doesn't find it a tiny bit insulting at the way he speaks about woman is either a part of the problem or a delusional ride or die.😔
Your editor snapped, girl! 🙌🏽  Also, L in the chat for that Drake mention in your ad 😬
The moment ryland was like vlogging alone is awk & the worker asked if he needs help, SENDED ME LMAOOO
I love Ryland he is so relatable and just the best of all worlds I love that he gets his hands dirty and loves to work and do things but can also tell you if your outfit needs work lol he's just awesome and I will always support! Love you Ryland! ❤
I’d wear those around the house as socks lol
Oh and people are programmed to follow movement with their eyes. So it is really less stalkerish than it appears.
What if you got a solar water fountain tis an idea love u girly
Haha what about that spider gave black widow? The big round shiny abdomen the whit or red hourglass on its underside?   Why not use the umbrella out by the pool? You may be able to find a base cheaper at Costco
I rewatch Ryland & Shane’s old Videos everyday while I eat breakfast. Todays a Good Day
Love it Ryland. Hey look up color water features.. No electrician needed!!
Our outdoor patio looks awesome! 👍😃🥰💚👏👏
I like the horse the way it is. Looks like a zombie
Original strawberry shortcake sun twice in the video...awesome. Childhood memories.
Yup you need outdoor rugs
FABULOUS!!! The courtyard looks stunning! I’d hire Ryland if I could!! Happy Birthday to you!!❤ Shane, I love how happy you are in the vlogs & podcast. I haven’t seen you this happy in a long time-it’s amazing! You deserve it! ❤
mcdonalds and now starbucks?? come on…the boycott……
I love watching the views increase as I’m watching the vlog 🥺❤️
Idea: cables strung across the entire courtyard and then some sectional fabric panels to pull across the areas of the patio you wanted shaded at any given time.  umbrellas are always tip over so easy and the weights to hold them down are big toe stubbers.
Is NO ONE gonna mention that SPIDER??? Oh hell no 😭
💜💜💜💜💜
The yard looks so amazing Ryland!! Great job. What a gorgeous place to be able to relax in!
Love that the store let's the cats sleep there ❤ so cute!!
It all looks so good 🎉 I love it 🫶🏽
You motivated me to do the same for my patio area ❤
Saw the notif at work and couldn’t wait until I got home to watch 🥰
Who else only clicks just to see the cute babies?? ✋🏻
He kept saying bark, and I was so confused what the fuck is bark? Why are you painting the bark in the trees?? I call that mulch lmao
Yay!! I needed a pick me up today and this is just what the doctor ordered!! Love when Ryland uploads! My mood stabilizer! ❤
Very beautiful Ryland.  You always do a great job. I'd love to have a man like you, hell I'd murder to be a man like you. Love you guys
You did a FANTASTIC job Ryland! I love everything you did! Enjoy all your hard work!
Not them promoting Kanye and Starbucks in the same video…love them but read the room.
Ryland get a solar water feature
U guys need to boycott and speak up on the war … please
Lol did you just literally carry a dolly.. boy there is wheels! Bahaha
Heck yeah Ryland! I just started the video and I already know the final reveal is going to be amazing! I've been loving your design/Reno/makeover journey 😁
I need to see it at night time with those string lights on!
Yassss love you Ryland so proud😮🫶🏻
I love seeing Ryland is his element, he looks so happy. And I LOVE the “room” makeovers !
Ok….why was Ryland HOT 👀 after that shower and hot yoga😍
Please stop calling women 'bitch'.
Hey Ryland, I know the cats don’t go outside but just so you’re aware - the lillies in the snail in the courtyard are fatal for cats, every part of the plant in tiny doses and even the water that runs out of the pot will be extremely dangerous for them to come into contact with!
❤
Definitely a great way to start the week ! 🙌🥰💕
There's Honey....well, no, no,  Honey....
Ryland! Buy a Folding platform dolly! ❤
What if you had a local artist from youtube come out and do the horse justice with a cool design???
Drake?
All eyes on palestine 🇵🇸
being 10000000% respectful with this compliment for shane, I wish I looked like you. there is just smth like ahhh shane I know u have body and like appearance issues but man ur cute okay? I'm a trans dude/non binary. i was born female but I'm jealous of how u look. you look really nice and like your hugs would cure my debilitating depression.  your smile makes me happy and seeing u in videos makes me happy. i relate to you like a lot. wish I could meet you one day.  i love u dude and ryland u too!!! i watch your videos everyday, yalls voices just comfort me. thank you, keep making content !!!!! I've watched for like 11 years maybe longer.
Ryland I swear the haircut makes you look 10 years younger
I need to find me a Ryland
Here within the first hour 👇
It came out gorgeous!! Total home goals!!❤❤
It looks so good! I think an outdoor rug under the table would make it even more lovely and inviting! Shane- you look SO good!!!🎉
Starbucks fr. I do like how you didn’t enjoy the drinks tho. 😅 so can’t be that mad. 🇵🇸
As a mom, that is completely normal that your boys have those few days, usually it’s related to having a growth spurt, teething, new sleep pattern, baby sleep regression which effects their moods. All totally normal most babies go through this ❤
Ryland when you dead head your roses, cut back beyond three leaves until just above a five leaf configuration. I lived with a rose expert whatever that's called. Cutting like this makes them bloom more IDK why.
But I do like how you didn’t like drinks though 😊 🇵🇸
🤍
That intro beat tho, is poppin' ♡
OMG just boycott starbucks!! its so easy
Omgee love them❤️❤️❤️
It looks great, Ryland! Totally not necessary but maybe an outdoor rug or 2 could level up the cozy feel even more? Either way, enjoy your new space! ✨
Came out beautifully! Yes to some rugs for crawling babies.
Why doesn't Shane do ANYTHING
you're doin great, babes. Love the courtyard tour + shopping. these are still my fav vlogss
Guess they're staying in California
20:40 The shrek edit😂😂
Omg it’s my birthday too. Hey Taurus girlies
I don’t think you understand how much you inspire me to do home projects ❤️❤️ love it here
Not Ryland struggling with that dolley but the golf cart in the rat infested shed could get repaired and make the package getting a breeze.
What’s Shane working on? He’s so mysterious in this vlog 🥰
You did a great job Ryland... It looks amazing... And I love your happy energetic energy... ❤❤... Love you also Shane... You both are awesome...
The store should usually tell you this but I pretty sure those yellow flowers are toxic to cats and maybe dogs not too sure.
i just dont understand WHY you want to live in california over colorado
Ryan, you are good at everything!
The boys going through fussy phases maybe growth spurts. When my daughter was a baby I used the app called Wonder Weeks. It helped me to know what she was going through and learning.
I love the new cam but don’t love the face tracking it kinda hurts my eyes to look at love the vlogs tho
I never miss a vlog! My favorite!!
Lillies are extremely toxic for cats, even the pollen can cause liver failure, just be careful! I don’t let them anywhere near my house 😮
Just a heads up - yellow Lillie’s are deadly toxic to cats, any part of it and toxic to dogs, GI upset , kidney issues. Beautifully done though!
Dont get wooden furniture for outside lol Get actual outdoor furniture
Loved this!
All eyes on rafah and the Congo.
Have you looked into developmental leaps? I noticed with my little guy that his fussy times lined up with him going through a leap.
Lillies are toxic to cats, so you may want to be sure the dogs stay away from them so they don't bring pollen inside for the kitties.
Well done mama 🎉
Ryland calling mulch “bark” is sending me 😂
I actually loved this vlog! It looks great!
Wowwwww, it's realy so nice 😍😍😍😍
Ahhh yes 🥰 Quality-time with Ryland & Shane
U should colour match and spray paint that horse!
@RYAN AND SHANE I HAVE TO SAY THE YARD THE COURTYARD LOOKS GORGEOUS. THANKS FOR SHARING 😌😌😌
I thought u were swinging a baby round. Not a dolly 😂
I'm getting the vibe that Ryland is gonna live outside this summer
You guys live in a weird bubble and are so out of touch with the real world
I LOVE watching your vlogs like this! It gives me inspiration to redo stuff around my big house! 👏🏼🥹
Before I get past your delivery..why didn’t you just get your go cart 🛺 & bring it up.??🤣🤣🤣🥰
Cheeto is so old now 🥺🥺 he’s such a sweetie
Oh Roland it’s amazing!!!!! Also Happy Birthday! Have the best day! ❤❤❤❤
Ryland!!  Make sure no one touches your beautiful lily and then touches your kitties!!!
Can we talk about how healthy Shane is looking! Not that he didn’t look healthy before he just seems more confident in front of the camera again. It makes me so happy to see both of them bettering their lifestyles for their boys! 🖤🖤
And all i see now is a spooky person standing in the background of the swing at 27:24 - 27:26 and i'm so creeped out 😭   It looks beautiful thou! But that person creeped me out. Am i the only one seeing it? 😭
I love how you guys have lesbian dogs
I love Sundays and Mondays because Ryland posts on Mondays usually and Shane has his podcast every other Sunday, I just wish they could do it every Sunday!
Doing a little research, looks like that spider was a false black window. They have the same venom a black widow does but their jaws are weaker, so they don't inject as much venom when they bite, therefore less dangerous. However, not harmless so steer clear!
Ryland's decorating videos are my FAVORITE!! Literally redoing my bathroom while watching lol Just gives me so much motivation <3
You did an amazing job Ryland! Happy belated birthday! 🎉❤ Love you, your family, and vlogs so much 💖
🫶 🫶
i love watching these vlog im procrastinating instead of studying for my exams
Everytime I hear Ryland say how many times he's been to T.S I do get a little jealous. Nothing more would I love to take my daughter. T.S isnt coming to New Zealand because of the size of her stage 😢😢😢 Only other option was flying to Australia which is just too expensive. I am planning a Taylor themed birthday partyand hopefully the tour stays on Netflix so we can do a pretend concert. Xox Motgrhood can be heartbreaking.
Happy Early Birthday!!! (Mine was on the 8th) Love love love a fellow Taurean YT vlogging QUEEN!!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Beautiful job ! And I love the yelllow flower in her snail a perfect touch I love it 🥰 ❤
Gorgeous makeover!  Not sure if your kitties have access to the patio but lilies are poisonous for cats. Even if they just touch them. ❤
So, did you sell Colorado?
Am I the only one who wish these videos were an hr long?❤🎉
your so productive its insane
Please, do you not realize people are supposed to boycotting Starbucks?
Yayy love having new vlogs to watch!!
the grey in shane's beard 🥹 we're all getting old. 🥺😭 i been watching forver and i just love you guys
For the boba it's definitely the Starbucks you guys got the drink from because the refresher one is SO good. Please try it again somewhere else, promise it's so worth it. First time I tried it, it was amazing, the second time it tasted kinda like soap so it's def the place you go to lol
Ryland, you have managed to do so much whilst having babies to look after too. What an inspiration. I love the part with you trimming the roses.
I guarantee Shane did not edit this video. I wish he had. I'm 12 minutes in and have to turn it off. It's so annoying. The gulp and drink sounds are ridiculous. I do love to watch the vlogs and both of the podcasts but this was all over the place. We just like to watch you vlog we don't need all the sound effects and extra shit. 😅
Shane just being happy to be there and support was adorable 🤍
You know your a parent when it takes an hour to watch a half hour video 😅  LOVE the padio guys ❤
Loving the videos Ryan! 🫶🏻🩷
Loved this video!! So productive! Garden looks soo cute but I think it would look that little bit cuter with a garden rug!
You’ve done an amazing job 😍 would you be able to have a solar fountain? 🪴🪴
Loveeee the patio! Beautiful!
Baby tip that always work make as much noise as you can because it helps them get use to loud noise oh and let the dogs bark as well, trust me is work's
You did a beautiful job!!!! ❤
New vlog = day made! Happy early bday Ryland 🥳
Loved the makeover,but just a heads up, lilies are extreamly toxic for cats (not sure about dogs)
Ryland please check if the plants and flowers you bought are safe for your fur babies. I worked at a Emergency Animal vet and lillies are poisonous to cats.
Random question!!! But did Morgan meet the twins yet? Love y’all!
I beg stop using that stupid camera that tracks your every single minuscule movement. It makes me feel sick king 😭😭
The quality of your video!!!! The colors are popping!!
hey!! you guys should try the strawberry popping boba from dutch bros
It looks sooo good
Beautiful patio, the flowers really pop! Please be careful with the lilies you bought and the dogs, they are toxic if eaten and even the pollen can be harmful
I recommend succulents vs. seasonal flowers ! They survive in warm and rainy climates, and all year ! There’s also so many that have different colors that would help give you that same little pop of color in the hanging spots as flowers that wilt off. EDIT: as I typed this comment I saw your second haul that had a few. A good man Savannah🥲
I definitely have been going through include a Ryan and Shane marathon.I've been watching old videos and everything like that.I'm so excited to watch today's video I needed so much just for my mental health.When things are stressed or my Mommy time yellow's videos are my haven.Love you guys
Even though it's literally just grass it does so much for your lawn ❤️
Aww that’s my Trader Joes in Agoura and my Albertsons.
You can get a patio furniture tarp💕
Yay❤
Courtyard needs a water feature ;3
Okay but hear me out- outdoor rugs to warm it up! 😍
P.S. I love your blogs Ryland.
Is the catio still there for sweet Cheeto Ryland?   What do viewers think of the editing y’all? Be interested to know.
I don’t listen to taylor swift, not my thing ✨but i really enjoyed you reviewing her album ❤️ you should do that more often! Reviewing music, tv, movies on the vlog
😊😊😮
I love your vlogs ❤❤❤❤❤
Loved this vlog!
these r my fav kinda videos! the patio but especially that grass is 😚🤌 chefs kiss
i love yall but yall need to clean ur patio floor it would look so much nicer
LOOKS AHMAZING, ryland and shane💚
Did Charlie get his makeover???? 🐴 ❤️
Love the concept of this video! You did a great job, Ryland!!! Looks GOOD!!! 👍
I fucking love y’all so much. Always doing the most.
I hope you have a great birthday 🥰
This was the best video in awhile. Love watching your daily errands. Feels like I’m hanging out with you
Why did my post.post twice
Love the updated patio 😍Excited for you guys to create loads of awesome memories out there this summer 😎☀️
Shane is looking amazing ❤
love you both!!!!
Ok, Ryland this is the hair!!! Looks great!
Ryland you are really apart of the Taylor Swift Cult
You are a true boss mama.
I really like Ryland's vlogs, but the new editing style with so many sound effects in the videos makes turn them off.
Giving me all the motivation to redo my patio area
Not a black widow 😂
Every video is a dream come true with you guys 🙄 You both left reality a long time ago and haven't come back.
Beautiful patio. You have a great eye.
What a difference Ryland…. Congratulations on working so hard….the effort shows in the new beautiful space…. Proud of you and Shane 😊
14:10 you’re husband is not the only one who suffers from MISOPHONIA!  Please with the horrible drinking sounds. I’ve held off saying anything because I don’t wanna be a diva, but literally it makes me so fucking angry.
have you ever considered maybe an outdoor rug? the flooring is beautiful but it can break it up a little bit (whether you choose to put one under the couch or table) so it’s not so much tile
Why don't you put patio furniture covers on or atleast a Tarp.. to protect the patio furniture??
Please stop with the slurping sounds 😢
kanye and starbucks ? .... like what are yall doing supporting those
Put the big umbrella over the pool
What happened to the catio? 🐱
It’s cute!!
The new ones are good
Honestly you said about “just letting it dry like this” while I’m thinking “wow, Ryland’s hair and beard look so good here, it’s giving dad”
Clicked at one minute 😅
It looks 10 million times better!! Amazing work like always Ryland!!
My birthday was yesterday, yours is tomorrow! Happy birthday to us ❤
Ryland do you want to come do my backyard next?? It looks amazing!
Shane looking skinny
Hey! I just wanted to let you know that Jesus loves you so much! He sacrificed His life for you and is here to bring you salvation! May God bless you and May you have an awesome day! Amen❤️🙌🏼 "16 For God so loved the world(A) that he gave (B) his one and only begotten Son, (C) so that whoever believes(D) in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (E)" (John 3:16)!✝️🙏🏼
Babies go through something called “leaps” you should look them up! They explain what and why they’re going through what they’re going through and knowing why they’re fussy makes me feel so much better!!!
Have you thought about an outdoor rug out there?? Perhaps under the table to make it feel like two sections?
I like that the light that Morgan ran over is still there ❤
It's nice to hear the word Albertsons I think the East Coast version of Albertsons might be Acme
I miss the alpacas
A succulent wall would be so cute for that area!!! You could even do some plants that have a bit a hang too them like bleeding hearts (popular up here in Idaho) to help fill the pillars
I always look forward to your vlogs! Love seeing you guys ❤
It looks like you're thinking about selling.
Oh, Mama your patio is a dream! ❤
Is it just me or are the table chairs way to small for that monster table? Ok, maybe it's me..... But I LOVEEEEEEEEEE the yard!!! Beautiful...
So if you ever decide to take your talent on the road.. I volunteer as tribute for your first fan makeover!
Oh Ryland! Everything looks so beautiful❤
do you guys have a nanny? you're crazy productive with two babies lol
Perfect Monday pick me up 😭😭 yayyyy
Be careful with the yellow lily. It can be harmful to cats and dogs!
Love you guys🍉🍉🍉🍉
yall cure my brain rot tysm for the escapism
The app, The wonder weeks, tells you the phases of your baby and when they are going through fussy phases!! It helps so much 🫶🏼 recommend it
Best effing edits
Ps - plain ole powdered Comit is fantastic on pools!  AND because of its makeup, it works to help chlorinate.  😊
get an outdoor rug, and setup the table with a heavy outdoor friendly center piece - you welcome  -- kiss
Ahh omg 25 minutes ago i don’t think ive ever been this early
honestly ive been waiting for you to post!! my mental health is awful and your vlogs just cheer me up so much ❤
Baby wise, if you haven't heard of leaps, google it. I used wonderweeks with my first, it explains how their brains are changing and maturing. It's kinda wild
Hey Ryland! It’s normal for babies to have rough patches. My daughter would go 2 weeks of super happy, learning, etc. then 2 weeks of chaos. You guys will work through it and you’ll have wild two year olds before you know it!
Ryland ,  Shane if your reading this well be miracle I was homeless for 8 years just moved in a apt one year now have no furniture or bed no TV can you help any old furniture or new well be blessing hi to the boys stay beautiful God Bless ❤
Dutch bros has strawberry boba's and they are so yummy
Yes made my day ! Thank you for posting 🙏🏼🙏🏼
I think you need some cute outdoor rugs would really liven up the space
Seems like all your dreams come true. Mine come true but then I only get them for a few weeks before everything blows up and I lose them. Every time.
Loving the editing king!
Enjoy your videos, but you’re not a girl, but you are a beautiful guy. And please stop taking the Lords name in vain. Please❤️ Outdoor area looks amazing!!
Ryland, i love when you show us your renovations/decorations updates 🤗🫶

I just graduated college and the first thing I did with my big degree self was come here to watch Ryland decorate the patio. If I could, I would mail my gratitude stole to you and Shane. You're the whole reason I kept a good headspace throughout my whole college journey. So much love to the both of you!!

Shane is looking AMAZING!! Hello Daddy Glow! ❤🎉
Immediately clicked 🩷 my favorite 🥰🥰
EEEEK I can't wait
It looks amazing Ryland! 👏🙌😊
So glad y’all decided not to sell the house!  I never kept my house quiet when my babies slept.  The world isn’t quiet.  I would blast music, watch tv, vacuum, etc., while they were asleep.  🤷🏼‍♀️
I’m losing it at Honey perusing her lesbian relationship with Riley a month before pride month 😭

My husband told me the other day that he fell more in love with me because he “had you all wrong” and he found it charming I could see through the vail of bs and gossip. We’ve been together over 20 years and so it’s not everyday you hear something quite like that. Figured it might give you a smile. He’s a mermaid with me now. He’s even watching the sip with me when he’s home. :) 🖤💕
