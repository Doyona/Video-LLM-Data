who's here after de bruyne's transfer to napoli
Manchester City Vs Copenhagen 10’ KDB 1-0 34’ Mattson 1-1 49’ Silva 2-1 90+2 Foden 3-1 Full time Manchester City 3 Copenhagen 1
the commentary on de bruyne's goal😂
DE Bruyne is brilliant
De bruyne is def the best player itw
And you all are still going to praise Haaland as the football king.  Debryne is City’s man.
Anyone else see the dude take a bump on the bench
wow man city decimated their defense , good game to both teams tho
I give major respect to Copenhagen for making it very far to the RO16, they were in a pretty hard group with Bayern and Man United, And the players were very well, and even managed to score a goal.  EDIT: I understand United was terrible at the UCI but when the RO16 draws first came, If I were Copenhagen I would be a little nervous if I saw Bayern and Man United, and also Galatasaray, but them making top 2 to get out of the group stage is very impressive.
Wow
Man city with KDB is on another level
De bruyne 💥💯🇧🇪
Very important result for Manchester City! The chemistry KDB & Foden are building playing together more often is magical. Dias continued his great run of form. And I've run out of words to describe Rodri's brilliance. Outside of Ederson's individual msitake, City defended well. Credit to Copenhagen & their passionate fans. What an intense atmosphere. Gutted for Grealish. Hopefully, he's able to recover quickly! Well done, sky blues. C'mon CITY!!!🙌💙
Ederson been giving away to many balls out of the back this season he need to clean it up
Probably Foden’s best season.
Grabbara 🧤 🧱
Kevin de Britney looks like jack grealish
That advantage was BS...not that it mattered.
4:37 what an ederson thing to do, he’s overrated
Lol Kevin just passes the ball into the goal
KDB!!!
man if Haaland made that, we would never hear the end of it
Loved how Haaland got bodied 😂😂
Haaland has the attributes to be an all time great.
Copenhagen trolling with song 2 after the mattson goal lol😂😅🎉
De God Bruyne
That last goal was amazing team play. So simple, yet so smart and composed from all
That Foden and de Bruyne chemistry is a PROBLEM
Foden has been class lately. Man set up the last goal for himself what a baller.
the influence of kdb on foden is scary hours.
Gotta feel for Grabara, guy played an outstanding game, but City's attacking precision is sublime.
Idk how i feel about the voice change on that intro
Nah these narrators will put anyone to sleep. It's better just to hear the background noise.
Can someone point me out where is the kick by Haaland? Please
Edison: "Happy Valentines Day to Copenhagen."  MC Staff: "Next time just gift chocolates."
Grabara was outstanding even with 3 goals in.
I fkn dislike citeh.  Look at the ref. 😂 Couldn't be more obvious.    Horrible..   I hope the FA. Drags their arses to third division and 3 years without champions
In Pep, we trust. 2nd UCL trophy  coming soon.
I watched the full highlights expecting to see Haaland scoring an overhead kick. 😴 Why was ESPN comparing his imaginary effort to Cristiano’s?
Haaland low key pulls at least 2-3 defenders, making them leave so much free space for foden, Kevin and other players that can sneak in those open spaces to score.
Haaland talking trash😮  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sqtfbFd3tz0&ab_channel=CBSSports
In Pep, we trust. 2nd UCL trophy  coming soon.
Bye bye Copenhagen😂❤💛, so that’s the way to beat you. Guardiola is genious  .
2:02 The Announcer??? What was he even saying lol “Manchester Gitty”
The ref was outrageous in his favoritism with City…….
I hate how they show the winner in the thumbnail. It ruins it.

Is Ederson no longer elite? Playing for a team like City, he doesn't have much to do most matches, and yet he still manages to make more mistakes than you would expect him to, given the circumstances.
Gotta feel for Grabara, guy played an outstanding game, but City's attacking precision is sublime.
KDB, Haaland, Foden, Silva, Alvarez on the same team and coached by Guardiola!  That's just not fair. MC is the best team in the world right now.

Idk how you call for an advantage then call a foul not even 2 seconds later. Questionable refereeing in the second half
🔥🚀
Pep just drops Alveraz like a stone when Halland and Bruno returned.  Alveraz has been scoring so many goals. ..
Vamos City🎉!
The bottle aided the goal by De bruyne
For Copenhagen this is the Final.
Honestly, only way man city not wins the CL and prem again is if they make mistakes like that one goal. Ain’t no way man city losing on pure football.
That is NOT a foul at 10:27. Ridiculous call by the ref.
That is NOT a foul at 10:08. Ridiculous call by the ref.
I just want city to lose🥱🥱
So my American self landed here after plenty of Europeans said “watch the champions league, it’s the most exciting sport” and what do I see? A supposed top tier goalie kicking the ball right back to the other team and getting scored on 5 seconds later. Yeah I’ll stick to American football 💀💀💀💀
Foden is better than Messi (no disrespect).
sometimes you forget how athletic haaland is, really never gets the chance to run on the break like that & for him to get that high up is insane, lowkey feel like they're can be more use for him rather than in a possesion based team. poachers finishes are good & essential,but he's so dynamic that I feel like he can be used in many ways
Can’t beat city when they’re in this kind of form coming from a Barca fan
Right after the Bernardo goal it looks like the manager next to pep took some time to REALLY celebrate lmaooo
Can you bring back shorter highlights?
Foden’s new celebration
Keeper fault those  two first goals from city could’ve been saved
DeBruyne takes this team from good to lethal.

we still scored 3 goals every game
De Bruyne is the best finisher in the premier league. He passes the ball into the net. Imagine if Rashford had his finishing ability he’d actually be world class. He does everything right up until it’s time to score. Last year was an outlier year he and it shows he’s just not consistent.
@6:46  🧐🧐
115
City are very beatable back line is a problem
It’s funny how many people are throwing shade at Haaland for attempting that scissor, think you’re forgetting how large and acrobatic Ibra was 😂
that last goal was just too nice great interplay by man city classic players with help from mateus nunez
Hi By Galatasaray fan... By bye Copenhagen
Nice
How is Copenhagens goalkeeper not mentioned. The guy had a man of the match performance and single handedly  denied Halland all game. Underrated and classy goalkeeper 👏
The ref made such obvious mistakes in favor of city. City were falling to the ground too easily. I hope they get humbled and stop diving 😅😅
This ref is a city fan
Manchester City seem to be better and better.. which is scary.
That KDB pass to Foden was absolutely clutch !!!
I’ll never understand why everyone gets Aké and Akanji’s names confused on which one is which
That ref easily matching the final
KDB has the cleanest right foot in football at the moment. It seems like every time he strikes the ball it just comes off of his foot perfectly smooth and direct and it makes all of his shots and passes incredibly satisfying to watch. He is just unreal, 6 assists and 2 goals in 7 games since coming back from injury.
Disappointing refereeing! The referee was definitely helping out Manchester City. What happened to the Champions investigation about their financial discrepancies? BS team! Cheaters!
City are just too good - best team in the world
Kdb is scaryyy
Enderson you need to own that! What are you doing? Use your dang hands 🧤 man. Wake 😴 up back there! 😤
Man City keeper always be trying to play the ball gotta Knock that sucker away
Let’s not ignore Copenhagen gk performance like man was stopping almost everything throw at him!!
I am glad to see Grealish is back. I hope he has recovered from the incident.
City win cl one time after being in the ro16 and semi and finals so much time while dominating epl through all those run now everyone think they’re winning a back to back cl😂😂😂 smh
For many of you who watch most of City's game, do you think that Pep uses Haaland correctly? I feel like the not only dont do him justice, but when I am able to watch the game, I feel like Haaland should have more aerial presence or more plays for him since he is so lethal. Am I trippin?
Where is the highlights of the injuries, randomly there is new player on the pitch
Wow!!!
I mean was this really a surprise to Anyone. Man city always getting the easy teams in group stages and R16.
foden in love with kdb
Man City are so talented. Just look at the way they avoid tons of pressure with a bunch of one touches passes 9:38. It's amazing at this level of football. Mind you, they were doing this all game.
without KDB City are just another Chelsea
Foden has been on fire lately
Happy for City, but Copenhagen put up a good fight
De Bruyne 1 goal, 2 assists. Sticazzi
Ruben Dias has made more mistakes this season than I have seen in his entire career
The second goal everyone was put off by the Police alarm. Someone in the crowd participated in Bernardo’s goal
That last goal was amazing team play. So simple, yet so smart and composed from all
Worst referee
More goals than  Anthony
De Bruyne is MVP
10 delicious passes for that last goal. Wow!
Thank you pep guardiola,
That stadium is underrated.
Sterling and Gabriel Jesus need to answer for their crimes against KDB. He could have had 350+ assist and be the greatest playmaker in the world
wow, some bad calls against copenhagen, shoulder to shoulder and the continuation one... man city gnarly tho...
Crazy thing is foden isn’t done developing. I hope he becomes better than sterling . Sterling was a baller tho
Ederson is trash bros lucky he plays with a good defence or else he would have faced same fate as Onana 😅😅😅
The ref is a City supporter for sure. Not that it would affect the result much, but some of those decisions were terrible.
Bernardo one of the most underrated world class players ever.
Grabara had a fantastic performance in goal. Wolfsburg got themselves a gem
Pretty mean this Copenhagen team.
KBD and Foden play so well together. They know exactly where the other is and where they're gonna be
We gotta start being honest with ourselves, Phil Foden is that guy lol.
City when having a name = Silva , opponents must mark this player. Do not know why it is coincidence such as David Silva and Bernardo Silva 😅
Foden da goat 🐐
Galatasaray was better but copenhag played that match sir 😢so heartbreaking.good luck
KD IS ON FIRE 1 goal 2 assists!!!
Isn’t this the same ref that Madrid didn’t want because of the bias towards other teams besides Madrid? Pep doing work under the table. Once a cheat always a cheat.
Kevin Kevin Kevin!
De Bruyne 🤴🏼. Foden. 💪
kdb and foden are such a joy to watch. such delicious football.
Galatasaray would make much more than this. Copenhagen should stop thinking their cheap defense and artificial grass will eventually save them.
Goddamn, Foden giving Pep a chance to flex his bench in the next leg.
Man KDB is unreal. The good ones do amazing things, but the great ones make it seem effortless
Stop spoiling the winners in the thumbnail
1:17 great save
KDB with two assists and a goal. Class.
City always getting the easy route.
🤙 9:38 👌
Kdb is a joke man he is unreal
I’ve NEVER, EVER trusted Ederson with a back pass and he confirmed my fears tonight. Smh
6:02 Fair point. Alvarez is more suited to Guardiola, only he's too scared to bench Haaland
The Referi must be fired
Foden’s new celebration 🔥🔥🔥
KDB not having a Ballon D'Or trophy is a crime
Is Ederson no longer elite? Playing for a team like City, he doesn't have much to do most matches, and yet he still manages to make more mistakes than you would expect him to, given the circumstances.
Ederson being City's weakest link rn smh
from a city fan, it was nice to see haaland getting thrown around 😊 after all the bullying he does to defenders😂 don’t think any of them were fouls personally
The excellent symmetry and passing game between KDB & Foden is simply sublime! Amazing passing & teamwork…just as Pep expects it!
that was not a foul against haaland at around 10:40,, was absolutely just shoulder to shoulder bodying. he literally does it to defenders all the time and it’s always okay!! and this is coming from a city and haaland fan.
Always leave out the best parts
The highlights editor ain’t a football fan
Was KdB 1 goal and 2 assists? Too lazy to rewind.
I absolutely hate Foden.Annoys the hell out of me, everything about him, but he’s damn good.
Why they put the bottle of water close the Goal to make a Target with with shoots for goals 😅😅😅
Foden and KDB were outstanding today! Think City are hitting their form now and what a perfect time to do it!
That assist from de Bruyne to Phoden 🫡
Ref was worse all game.
You have to start thinking it’s rigged when man city consistently draw the WEAKEAST teams possible. They are paying the corrupt organization with their oil money
you can see how CPH made it to the champions league, they play good football. Theres just no stopping KDB and Foden rn.
What a play
I watched the game
They should ban the water bottle near the post like that.
MC was aiming the water bottle near the post? Good job.. p.s never put the water bottle near the post, also it should not be legal?
After watching entertaining City, it is quite difficult to stomach Chelsea.
I mean, with Alvarez finally back on the bench where he belongs, this team is just lethal. KDB is incredible. What a player.
KDB and Foden once again show how freaking deadly they can be, Man city is gonna be a tough rival I can tell 🔥🔥😮‍💨
What a pass on that last goal
did debruyne mean to score or it was a lucky one...i think he crossed it ,,,,
Foden got the dumbest looking face every time he has the ball
5:34 The reason why defenders should never turn sideways for a shot on goal.
Foden and KDB are easily my two favorite footballers
KDB is looking like Zidane these days.
my ginger brother never fails me
Haaland needs to master free kicks so he can hit a rocket like Cristiano and Roberto Carlos used to do
2:02 The Announcer??? What was he even saying lol “Manchester Gitty”
why would I ever assume that Man City get a tough draw in the round of 16?
KDB what a player..!!
Rodri is like wtf Ederson. lol
Man city lucky - facing small club
City will have big shoes to fill when KDB leaves
Bernardo!!😎
I love the passion of the Danish team.
Without KDB Man City aren’t that threatening. Shows the levels.  Man City 3 goals KDB 3 goal contributions
These clowns once again don’t show the reason why Grealish was subbed. You need people that know about Futbol doing your editing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ederson pass is when youre playing fifa and the sprint speed is at max for the AI 😂
As a city fan both team played well but the referee was disgusting
I’m calling it ederson will cost city the CL against a stronger team
4:15 Copenhagen should have had a pen
who is watching it now?
Bro de bruyne is so good
Man it takes forever for top premier teams to play eachother.
KDB King 👑
If Haaland made that goal..😤😮‍💨
This is Barca vs Real Madrid.
Annoying intro voice why change it SMH😒
That Fidel celebration is cold
0:00-0:05 I lost 😳
English commentators are so boring 😴
Mark my words Foden will be PAID next contract
That first goal by KDB was immaculate -- City with KDB is frightening!
City
OMG If Haaland made that
Haaland being a placer holder is a bummer. Great win.
You need Foden, not Haaland. Foden can do both...defend, assist and score.
Cheats 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Lots of chemistry between Foden and KDB17🎉🎉🎉
What a performance from KDB , honestly city’s best player , he’s just the brains 🧠 of the midfield
with every game, KDB cements himself as one of the best midfielders/players of all time. what a player
Great game for Man. City and great game for Copenhagen doing way better than Man. United does against City
I've said it million times, Ederson will cost Man City dearly in a very important game, he never learns from his stupid mistakes, i.e vs Tottenham last year and every game, he almost gifts the opponents with a goal.
13:27  Look at Copenhagen 33 number player near keeper,   Imagine making that much money from sport and being afraid of a round plastic object?  I jump in front of ball being in similar situations  while playing sunday league games
Copenhagen does not deserve to be on this level.
Ederson lucky his team can score
Of course, Taapland ghosted once again like he ghosted in the UCL Final & Semifinal, UEFA Super Cup, FA Cup Final and the Community Cup Final. R9 is lightyears better.
In Pep, we trust. 2nd UCL trophy 🏆 coming soon. 💙
That Foden and de Bruyne chemistry is a PROBLEM
Refs need to allow more contact. Pretty weak game from the center ref.
CBS is Deep State 'News'. They helped steal the election and install a puppet in the White House.
Copenhagen needs to defend. Copenhagen put 10 centerbacks...
foden and kdb are such proper footballers!!
I won't respect City unless all the charges are dropped
So it was DeBruyne and 10 others?
A lot of talk this weekend about dynasties with the Chiefs & Mahomes.. well with the form City is in you might be looking at another dynasty in the making.
that was a clear shoulder to shoulder on haaland... a shame that the ref called that to be honest
Anyone ever notice the formation given in the beginning is almost always wrong 😅
The commentary at 10:50 is wild!!!! 😜
Foden👏🏿
Kdb is him
what a debut
Pep 🐐
That was a way tougher game than I was expecting although I did rid some analysis yesterday about how Copenhagen have played spoiler lately and no doubt Pep had the team in the right frame of mind.
The third goal takes all the pressure off now, City will handle business at home
That Haaland scissor kick attempt was outrageous.  The height on his vertical with both feet off the ground was absolutely ridiculous.
I give major respect to Copenhagen for making it very far to the RO16, they were in a pretty hard group with Bayern and Man United, And the players were very well, and even managed to score a goal.  EDIT: I understand United was terrible at the UCI but when the RO16 draws first came, If I were Copenhagen I would be a little nervous if I saw Bayern and Man United, and also Galatasaray, but them making top 2 to get out of the group stage is very impressive.
W UCL match! 😁
Bernardo Silva’s finishing is sublime. Still remember the damage he did vs Madrid at the Etihad last season. Phenomenal footballer for City, yet very underrated and little talked about
*Idk how i feel about the voice change on that intro* 🥴
This ad read stinks.
Why did they change the beginning to a women 😐
THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GOAT 🐐 THE GOAT (KDB❤)
And United Fans were saying Bruno is in KDB level 😂
kdb > modric and krooss
FairPlay to Copenhagen but I’m proud of my team, KDB with a 10/10 performance
man if Haaland made that, we would never hear the end of it
Man City showing their dominance again. KDB playing excellent. What else is new
Man city this, madrid that Paris saint-germain Are coming tomorow to take control ALLEZ PARIS🔴🔵
Man City are just unstoppable, Probably gonna win the UCL Again.
First
