Why did their garbage battery go bad after 3000 miles? Ferrari should have paid your bill for the other garage fixing it now that you proved it was the battery not your changing the exhaust!?!
Surely someone had the knowledge to start at the battery & charging system first.. that's horrendous.  The fact they slap their logo on it, probably means it is junk that they want 2000% markup on.
Almost 22 minutes of talking which should of taking five minutes. Who buys very expensive cars and not see it or check the history before hand. Its just madness.
Place a Multi Meter on DC across the battery terminals and check the rate of charge. It may eliminate or confirm if you have an Alternator fault. Many high end vehicles are fitted with Alternators that have a variable charging rate depending upon the age of the battery, or if a replacement battery has been installed. The battery reset is reprogrammable via the OBD.
With all the heritage class ferrari have thats wot were led 2 belive .but to hear there attitude towards this guy .makes u think they liked only his money  your face dont fit type deals
I know it’s kind’ve a heartfelt vid cuz of his mum, but did anyone notice the Patek perpetual on his wrist… fu*king class
Putting a new exhaust on a new ferrari is like telling your new wife that she needs to get a boob job to go from 42D to 44D.  Seriously?  Leave it alone.
So Novitech is officially working with Rari, but Rari cancels the warranty after they work on it ?? A ferrari is not meant to be driven.... big Ferrari fan... one month after this video he sold it......now he has a sheiss Lambo... more misery...
Well they can't be that bright because you would think they would check the Battery FIRST. Especially on a Electrical Issue.
Are you sure that you bought a car that was made on your enemy year?
Buy a Volkswagen Golf.
Novitech Blow 100% columbian.
I just stumbled across this what I thought was a car channel only to find out it’s a talking channel. With an occasional car making an appearance.
No matter what anyone says I love Nico, mans is a genuine lad and just wants to enjoy life, I can respect that ❤
yo awesome video
good luck mate.
Hey, I hope your mom is ok man. On the flip side when it comes to your car, I think you got a lemon dude. It happens.. If I were you I would try and get rid of it for another cause for a car that expensive to have that many problems and to walk on egg shells every time you drive it is ridiculous. You should be driven and viben. Not worried about what's going to go wrong next.
Message me damn see you wouldn’t get ripped off on watches seeing this is like answering a text saying you owe money you need a car guy!
What modification did you do to the car that flagged up the warranty problem?
2 1/2 weeks to check the battery?
Cold start then REV is ridiculously disrespectful
Prayers for your mom
Get rid of it
Matt literally said battery 😂😂
Sorry but you are boring to hear about your rubbish Ferrari it's a boring car go with Lamborghini better looking better car
Look your a watch guy im an ex car dealer ,you would have been my dream,a clueless wallet chucker a true hands up billy,buying supercars sight unseen going through intermediaries,paying owner not vendor....so pisitive advice,aproach buying cars like you do trading watches,dont be giddy and stupid,you have bought yourself into a group that do know what they are doing lucky for you,but you dont want to be their sideshow,as for being evangelical about ferrari then buying a lambo,embarrasing....as for upgrading your car,heres a tip,the single best performance enhancing inexpensive improvement to the performance of your car is this....get some driving tuition....lots
Have you checked the fuse that’s connected to the positive battery cable. The errors your getting seems like it may have been that
Don’t be a guy who pretends be original. As if naming second channel mk2 is original enough, atleast add a generic name instead of copying
Stop moving the camera so much. Keep it stable they say it for a reason you are not a car youtuber. Only if it weren’t for a car I would mever watch your whole video ever
I’m not sure you’re the biggest in the world on YouTube regarding watches. The jews out of New York may have you beat bro.
Don’t mess about with cars - end of.   Novitec & all the other after market junk out there - balls up these cars.  Don’t alter them.
Did they test -  EVERY WIRE, PLUG & FUSE?  EVERY WIRE, PLUG & FUSE?  EVERY WIRE, PLUG & FUSE?   you didn’t say??
Genuine Hublot Battery
Why haven't you put anything up
You can put stock parts back on a car but if something happens while modified its still the caus and going back stock won't fix the warranty. You can 💩 in your lemonade then scoop it out but you're still drinking sh💩tty lemonade lmao
Cars and u are the future love watching all the videos
Fair pay to novitec, Ferrari like most of the top watch makers. Up their own arse.
Every lead, Every fuse, Every plug, & it still Ballaxed
Bro I did tell us the same story like 8 times!! Lol
Read the manual and learn about your car
This is an angel car still broke. It’s not the battery.
Niko, glad that 812 is fixed for you. It's is so beautiful and amazing.
This issue happens to a lot of European cars. You'll see it on Audi's mercedes etc. just let your battery go flat and watch what happens when you turn it on and read the codes. Make sure the alternator is putting out the right voltage. It sounds like you're going to need some specialist equipment now... Namely an oscilloscope.. it's still an electrical issue and it's something big becuase it's affecting so many unrelated systems in the car. Think about all the systems that aren't working correctly and then ask yourself what do all of these systems have in common and it's usually  a good place to start.
Proud of you I come from nothing and I'm still there love watching you dde and jww , you guys make me smile
15:05 you're just a pure soul who is rare nowadays in this fcking world!   Love you Niko ❤
Dude!! Mat is an absolute fcking genius, when you were stucked in the highway and when Mat was facing oil leakage issue in his marcèalago, and is slowly cruising towards his destination, when he got to know about your ferrari errors he firstly said that it might be a battery issue!!  This blew up my fcking mind! What a genius 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
That’s what you get when you tune your car. This is your own fault Leonard you should have let Ferrari fix it before you went to tune it. So stop crying.
Hope to see you next year if you guys come back to town
If the battery went bad that soon, I'd guess you have an electrical drain that hasn't yet been identified.
It seems ridiculous that Ferrari cares more about the warranty than  the faults your vehicle is experiencing.. especially being so new.  Signs of corporations manipulating politics to do what they want...
Love the 812 with novitec exhaust. It's a banshee. However, there's a tesla or two in the background on novitec factory that bothers me.
FFS a battery I was put off getting one because your one was fucked...oh wait I can't afford one anyway 😅
If I ever did have the funds Novitec seems like a class act, they would be my go-to persons for anything aftermarket Ferarri.  Glad your Mum is well and your car is back with you, sounds like things are very positive, and that is always a good thing.
The 812 Ferrari you have is sweet
Late to the party, I have followed Mat and Chris for a while now, came across ur chanel, love it mate! Ur content is amazing and such a genuine lad!
How is this my first time hearing of this godtier channel?
Need to clean that cigarette ash off of the B Pillar lol.
The fact that it’s RHD makes it look even better to me but to them that’s normal
Any new updates Nico???
heart
"Check my car I didn't do a burnout!" 😂😂  Love it bro!!!
Crazy that Ferrari gives their customers bs, I understand if car is significantly modded which may effect warranty but a customer spends hundreds of thousands on your product and you dont try to help...where is the loyalty??
I hope he realises with his car being on finance hes not allowed to do any extreme modifications
Sounds lkke a battery related problem not enough voltage new battery helped but alternator maybe some dumb ground or wire
I mean almost 600k views pretty big for a auto youtuber
I guess it's cause it's a ferrari but any other brand lower brands ford Chevy Mercedes etc first thing I would of done is check and or changed the battery
Same thing happens to bmw when the battery pisses out! Like I said in your video on your other channel! YOU MUST PUT A FKN TRICKLE CHARGER ON A POS FERRARI!!! They kill voltage parked!!! Same thing with bmw, landrover and many other pos euro piss brands!
Niko I think you are a wonderful person what make you wonderful is your honesty and directness. Straight to the point guy. Your content is excellent as well. Thank you for putting yourself out there for people to hate and love you. Good job.
It's a spaghetti car worst than a yugo😂
Check brake switch too
And the "funny" thing (as Ferrari said the warranty is void because of non-Ferrari parts)...the problems are caused by a "Genuine Ferrari" part which also has a big, huge yellow sticker on it. Oh Ferrari, your cars are just a piece of crap. And I get it if you love or like the brand, but they behavior which comes with it and voiding the warranty without even fixing the issue and proving that it's the third-party exhaust. In comparison to that Novitec took responsibility (which Ferrari should have done in the first place) and found and fixed the issue. It's easy to blame someone else but a different thing to take responsibility.
My childhood dream car was a sapphire cosworth is wish I could make money selling watches to ever afford one like you have with your dream car.. wish you could mentor me and get me on the road in a dream car ❤
This man is unhinged!
fERRORi 😛
Edit, get an editor... What did they fix? Did they deffo check the lines, plugs, fuses etc.? Im not sure if you said it 5, 10 or 20 times? I do hope your mom is well but I am concerned about this jump from watches- out of your element. The toys you loved doesnt turn you into a driver or car expert... 'ESC OFF... Choober bins GT3 backwards into another canal...
Man, I swear I said it was the battery. When he said a jump can get it to start It was obvious to me.
I have a 458 spider - ditto - warning signs galore - changed to a Duracell battery - now all good :-) Crazy
Nico laughs how people laugh when they make fun of the french😂
LOVE IT
Why do you a drive? Buy a Porsche 🇩🇪
Bad batteries always throw multiple warning lights.  Whenever you see multiple warning lights change that first.  Having said that I’d never mod a Ferrari or Lambo.  How fast do you really need it.
Sell ur Ferrari if you can’t afford it and keep complaining on yt
Glad to see you've got your car back and it's not a disastrous problem. That's some incredible customer service from the shop and great support from friends.
This is completely normal for Ferrari 😂 Their welds are terrible too 😂
Don’t own a Ferrari but guessing you have a bad ECU or something corrupted it’s software bro
The art of talking too much without saying anything 😂
Makes me want to buy a Mclaren sorry nico it needs to go nothing but trouble
Where is my Rolex,.😏
Im here for the rolex
Hope everything gets fixed and you can start injoying your car.
Everyone, please share or just grab your gf phone & subscribe for her 😂🎉
Literally two things i love are watches and cars this channel is gonna be sick but nico please post more on here 😂
I didnt know nico was this rich gyaaaaat
Can't put the warranty back to stock.
Man…. I was hoping that when we reached Ferrari level that I wouldn’t need to say a prayer before I turn the ignition.  Since 2007 I’ve had nothing but dashboard disco from every single car. No matter the brand. If it’s fast I’ve had it… and it’s sh@t the bed. Been ripped off x25 and then finally found the right people   I’ve come to the conclusion that I shall just buy Mazda mx5’s and strap mahoosive turbos on since I test drive a McLaren (who by the way are the friken Rolex of the car world- except they don’t make perfect product, it had 3 warning lights come on the test drive and I just start p*ssing myself laughing when I realised I was willing to finance something that cost more than a house that would just give me as many headaches as an evo x that cost 20k…. And would also smoke it Lb for lb. If there’s anyone reading this thinking “aye right”  Put yourself in the seat of a 300k car , look in the mirror and see that the thing sat on your tail is a Japanese haemorrhoid and i promise you you’re waving it by or getting smoked…. Or coming out of a ditch 😂✌️
Is one of the things Ferraris are known for, just errors for now reason. Great machines but in the usual italian style they have problems
Back to working order! Hahahahahaha!!!!
he repeat 5 times the same things
18:45 loves a tab in his Ferrari our Nico
Your the crazzies of them all, love your content and story.
Pushbike 🤷🏽‍♂️
Go and buy yourself a Lexus LC with a 5ltr V8 engine..either coupe or convertible.Its far cheaper than the Ferrari the engine has a great V8 growl..but most importantly,they don't break! Do go and check one out you won't be disappointed.
NICO.. Don't get PUNKED by a over rated car company.  You deserve what you got paid for
It could be you computer getting too hot or there's a ground wire that is not getting good enough ground to keep the power going through the car. It happened to my truck running for hours and sunny. Everything will cut off check the main ground wire from the car
And imagine...after all that the fucking car still with the same problem.
That’s still was very shitty from Ferrari, it was a battery and their own people couldn’t figure that out?
Did they reprogram the battery if they just installed it and not reprogram it this could be the problem!
Wasn’t that the first thing the tech said in Monaco, “might be the battery?”
It could be a lemon.
Is there an update?
Need more content
what ever happened to the Ferrari????????, came searching to see if there was a conclusion and i missed it>
Are you going to do an update soon?
My mom's Ford Ka was more reliable than a Ferrari. Glad you got it fixed though!
How did this actually pan out? Would love to see an update on what actually was wrong.
when is the conclusion coming?
My god ??? what a bad service from Ferrari...one a hade ols one Ferrari 360 modena ,and after one day ....shit happens ....2 weeks in the garage and bill from 9980€  (15 years ago)
I drive a posh Toyota and a few months back my battery was on the way out & caused similar problems, don't let the haters hate !
O ya Ferrari is like the hublot of the Car industry you can’t modify them without Ferrari getting butt hurt and there’s always a problem with a Ferrari.
Yo Nico if you would’ve listened to the DDE boys, you would know that a Ferrari is finicky if you want something reliable you get yourself a Lamborghini
Did the (ECU) computer get replaced back in Monaco?
Try having the immobilizer system disabled.
put it Vossen HF7
Novitec, Ferrari and Brabus for resole this problem
Something caused the original battery to fry check out the alternator and the resistance in the line I don't understand why the mechanics didn't do that after changing the battery it's obvious .
when new episode?
I suspected the battery because it would run fine on a jumper, but i never worked on a Ferrari. Its like back in the day, when your alternator or battery was about to go bad and just not putting out enough juice, the bass would not hit hard and would hit less when you turn the lights on. Check engine lights firing off like fireworks. you def got the run around.
Just start posting things 1 post in months WTF NIC..?!!
Such a mighty car and all it takes is a battery
DDE Fam❤
Given the electrical changes in the security system etc. I would be concerned about the security system flooding the BUS of the car.  Those types of systems have the ability to not only send, but receive messages.  If the unit sends too much communication it can "flood" the system.  This is likely why resetting the ECU gets you by for a bit, but once the communication starts creating errors then the onboard system is unable to get proper communication.  In my mind, I would remove all 3rd party systems.  Check all grounds to ensure something wasn't missed and check all connectors to assure you don't have a poor connection.  Sometimes pins can move then the connectors are connected.  It's fussy work, but critical with electrical problems.
Is this channel dead?
feels like you have a grounding isseu, around the alternatortry connecting a direct wattage meter for a while, you can see really fast when something is spiking. it is weird tho no fuzes broke..
308QV here....the sound still makes me smile.....my first Ferrari was a 348SS  - they are both great cars!!  Love yours too.
i think you have a alternator issue
How about putting your original exhaust back on for a while, purely to rule that out as a problem and stop Ferrari bumming you.
Hello Nico, I had something similar happen to my 296 after installing the Novitec, where i had numerous fault codes putting the car in limp mode. The fault was the butterfly valve on one bank could not reference properly because of the spring tension was not correct. The local Ferrari people were awesome as i was given another 296 for a Ferrari rally. The 296 and the SF90 are similar in how they work as they proportional open the valves as you drive harder. I believe the 812 just opens them straight up; but I'm not sure. Novitec system is just amazing, but there is a module that Novitec install to trick the Ferrari computer because of the possible faults and increase in a slight performance. I put the original Ferrari one back in, after this with no more issues, sound is the same, but butterflys behave like factory. Another customer with a 296 had the Novitec system but bypassed the valves, but way to loud but never had any issues. Personally i think its the Novitec module that is corrupting your 812; I would go back to standard Ferrari module, Cheers Sven.
Are we ever going to see content on this page ?
Need an update on the Ferrari.
Any update?
Quality of a ferrari cars is absolute dog shite, dont buy their cars. Its overhyped and its just a crap car. It does look good but is it worth it tho? Not for me
Problems with your car? Ask the Germans, even if your car is Italian…  Edit: next time - buy a German car 😉
I knew it was batt in matts video when buddy said it was hot when took connection off first time on hwy lmfao 😂
Waffle fest 😂
So what happened? I’m guessing you want to or already put it back to stock. Can we get an update?
If you spend that much money on a car you really shouldn’t have to worry that much. The anxiety Nico has is warranted, I would hate that feeling. He was afraid to turn the car off FFS.
Did they check all the wires and all the fuses? LOL
Happy it all worked out and your mum is doing ok, love your watch channel, very inspiring geezer
A battery swap would have been my first action. Cheaper than one nights hotel cost in Manaco. Perhaps the first  dealer could have fitted a "loner" battery in half an hour and solved the problem.
Merry Christmas. Nice that it was only the Batterie. The Most expensive Batterie in the world. Because sleeping in Monaco etc. Go Forward Nico. Have fun. Ciao
I have driven BMW's for almost 30 years and anytime the battery goes bad, all kind of strange codes start coming up...first time it happened the system had me believing the transmission was going out...turned out it was just the battery...now anytime I get strange error codes, I check the battery...the system is so sensitive it starts to happen when the battery is going out, not when it's completely dead...but one time it was not the battery, but the alternator, was not charging properly and luckily BMW covered the replacement even though I was a few thousand miles past the warranty.
I hope your Mum is okay.
… i have to ask: did they check the fuses? 😂
May want to add some more content to help pay for that ride.
Doing hard donuts and wiping the car around could have popped the Pyro fuse
You do after market parts you need to learn how to work on them
Made in Italy, looks nice but can't trust it.
I love Ferrari and have a testarossa but to see this firm refuse warranty on a brand new vehicle because he changed the exhaust is absolutely disgusting and reprehensible and surprise they are so stuck up their own backside they do not care shame
Nico, soooo are you going to upload a new video? Or are you a quitter? Because I know damn well you ain’t no quitter. Your mama raised you better than that. Get out of the slump and get it going! You got this mate!!
Had the same issue with  my Peugeot lol, changed the battery drove for about 10 miles and the dash lit up like an Xmas tree,  reset the codes after everything checked everything cleared , then I would get an issues with the auto clutch not going into drive , checked everything clear codes again ,drive for a few days lights come on like Xmas tree again. Finally after a month of shit ,we changed the only thing that was different on the car from when it was running OK. And guess what everything was fine with another new battery had the car for another 6 months no issues.
You have a great view on everything
I also had this issue when my motorbike battery is weak. Failure for traction control, ABS MTC, general failures ect. Just shits the bed, not enough voltage to crank + power all the gadgets. Newer cars / vehicles stress me tf out. Spend all this money & get left in the dark by the top guys at the company. I've found most dealerships are good. It's the top guys who seem to have the problem.
All of that commotion, emotion, hassle and heartbreak. For a battery… got to love modern cars🤣. Glad it’s sorted though! It’s a beast
The benefits of keeping car stock
Great advertisement for why NOT to ever own a Ferrari..I've rented them and they are amazing cars to drive, but this is just a bad experience. I HOPE Ferrari makes this situation good.
Sounds like it’s time to monitor battery voltage like a hawk. Buy a scanner, hook it up and drive around. See if there’s any correlation to battery voltage and warning lights. Then work backwards from there.
Hello brother, i just want to give suggestion how to fix your  ferari by sending it to youtuber mat amstrong that's has youtube channell buy racked car then fixed it untill running again from zero and maybe your ferari he could fixed
Brabus CEO Absolute legend!!!!!!!!!!
Seems to me that the ECU is the issue. There's something in the "polling cycle" that's been disturbed. Whenever the ECU runs it's checks on the system components, the order of when it does it and the timing allowed to complete the task has changed somehow. So, when it gets to the first thing that doesn't meet the criteria, it starts a cascade effect with everything after that so, you get all the faults. I think a battery voltage issue was the first "trigger" that you solved with a new battery. Looks like there may be other voltage issues involved. It could be a milli voltage issue that starts the problems in just one sensor so, it'll take diligent testing of components to find I think. Also, I think an ECU reflash may do the trick to fix what started all this but, if you modded the tune for the exhaust, that will become an issue again when you reinstall the tune. There may have been just one corrupt file in the tune at the time of original installation that could be causing the problem as well. Use fresh files for the re-install. Good luck with the repair M8! I hope you guys get it figured out!
Glad you've got you're car back... for future content...how about keeping the camera still and not repeating the same thing 3 times... just a thought
I can't believe the Ferrari dealer told you it was the computer ( UCU) when it wasn't, it was just a battery. That says something to me about the dealer. They should have checked the battery first and known what the problem was. Not throw parts like a new computer at it and hope it works.
Great story, pleased it turned out great in the end. I love cars & real shame what happened to you. Seriously felt for you mate, Last week I bought my first Ferrari so I'd know how it would feel. Mine is only a f430 Black with yellow as well. Good luck for the future mate. Glad you're mum is good.
Middle of the video had a bit too much repeating of the situation and going round in circles a bit. Could probably clean that up a little better in future videos.  Also, battery problems can sometimes cause or be ECU problems as well. I know I had battery issues and voltage drops on my Yamaha MT-07 and swapped out the battery, that seemed to run slightly better, but continued to have issues and heaps of random codes, ECU, O2 censors, immobiliser codes etc. etc. …   Unfortunately it’s super had to diagnose but it could be an ECU issue where the ECU is just fried… Manufacturing issues can happen, even with reputable brands like Ferrari. I ended up having mechanics testing everything under the sun on the bike… Yamaha gave me the run around with warranty too, and saying that in their “read outs from the ECU” they could see someone had “gone into my ECU and reprogrammed/done something to it” and legit no one had touched it… I had the bike stock bar an exhaust, and like some clutch / brake levers…  Then I said fuck it took it back off their hands, bought a second had ECU same part number off a crashed bike and plugged it in and it ran like a dream… See if Ferrari can test the ECU or get you a new one or another one programmed for your car to test of that’s the issue…  P.s. Sorry to hear about your Mum, hope she’s made a full recovery. Also good luck with your new channel… Found you through the video you did with Mat Armstrong… That dude is a legend and his crash car rebuilds are amazing!
I think it's safe to say you won't be starting a channel about smart phones, because that screen looks nearly destroyed. I'm sure it has plenty of stories to tell.   I pray your mom is doing better.
Yeah because Ferrrari. Don't have clue you tell them a fat 2atch expert that comes across as an absolute div
And this is why even if I could wver afford a ferrari I will never buy one
You might laugh… but my dad had the same issue in a Toyota Yaris… brand new car and it went bonkers. It was a faulty new battery.
Since it sounds intermittent, I agree with most in the comments saying alternator.  The car is likely draining or overcharging the battery more than it should, leading to electrical issues.
Prayers for your mum.
Id put the car back to stock and give it back. All the money i spent and thats the service i get????? Go get two lambos.
Didn't know FERRARI was built by Land Rover. To me, it's shocking that someone didn't replace the battery as the FIRST thing to eliminate the most simple thing.
glad it worked out Nico! That car probably sat a long time somewhere without a battery tender before you got it, and the battery was weak
Waffle on repeat 😂😂😂 wow
Met nico in traffic today and what an absolute gent rolled down his window to have a quick chat and the car sounds way better in person what a machine 👌👍
One thing i did not understand: did they now check any fuses, or wires or connections or not? You forgott to inform us about that.
Sell it get a new car
Sorry to hear your mother was unwell. Dear Nico you bought a Hublot of a car world. They charged you massively for every additional thing you wanted and just as you started driving it broke.Now tell us sincerely if the same situation was with ultra expensive watch how would you react on your channel. Or maybe you are being sponsored by car Hublot?!
You need to invest in a camera
Gutted for you. Proper depressing when something that much just won't work correct.
I am no Ferrari mechanic, but dam i would love to put a multimeter across the terminals new battery half fixing the problem is big clue. Put a metre that records peak voltage and check the alternator or check the wiring diagram showing for a few diodes. Something wrong with can bus putting a dodgy signal there.
Send it back…….once a problem car always a problem car
How funny it would be to take the battery back to Ferrari under warranty. Most batteries have 2 to 5 years warranty 😂😂😂. Great video bro 👍
Glad you took time to take care of Mom!  Conclusion Ferrari batteries are trash 🤣 Time to upgrade to a future proof mod a Ultra capacitor boost pack!
Did they check every wire though
Check your IBS.
Every wire, every connection, every plug.....can you say that again Nico? 🤣😂😭
We love you for the down to earth real guy you are Nico! And you have a great outlook on life! ❤
why did you buy a Ferrari?? Just figured it out! Classic shiny object syndrome. I have made that mistake also, but you are smarter than most people can see through bad watch dealers and watches, how could you get suckered into buying a Ferrari?
Novitec, Brabus, and all involved. Cheers.  I am impressed!
I would hate all this drama on a dream car. What a buzz kill. I think I'll stick with Porsche ;)
Sorry Nico, this is a dull video. Its too waffley and too long to explain it was a stupid battery.
check the alternator. when the car is standing still the alternator prob isnt strong enough to provide the voltage needed to keep the battery charged thats why the errors only pop up when stopped
Probably should have done some more research before you bought a Ferrari they've always been considered the most unreliable exotic car  with a lot of electronic problems
And again... What did you learn? Not to do dodgy modifications on a new Ferrari 😂
And again... What did you learn? Not to do dodgy modifications on a new Ferrari 😂
Ferrari = FIAT | FIAT means "FehlerInAllenTeilen" even with Battery  lol ( its a german joke ). But now to be serious, good ending of the story
Thank you Nico is all I have to say 👍  much love from England 🙏
Hi Nico, It's been awhile since your problem issues, first appeared in Monaco and it is so pleasing to hear about the love and support you have received in the intervening weeks.  Hoping that your mum is well on the way back to good health and you're such a good son to drop everything to go and support her in Finland.  And a REALLY HUGE SHOUTOUT TO:  The CEO of BRABUS who came to your aid with such support at the time when you faced your Family Emergency.  The team at INVOTEC MUNICH who worked so tirelessly fault-finding your Ferrari... but, then again, is there ever any Ferrari that is truly 'fault free'?  You're a good lad, Nico Leonard, and even though you faced all sorts of issues you bravely moved ahead.  I am looking forward to the next Nico + Ferrari Escapade.  Warmest Regards - David Nesbit from Melbourne Australia   🥸👌🍷🍷❤️❤️🦘
It's Ferrari!!! Lol Clearly you don't watch f1😂😂😂
Fair play what a relief!! What a beautiful car.
WoW This Car it's Insane Man  Very Beautiful Car Bro 🥰🥰
To conclude : Ferrari are beautiful and expensive cars, but reliable as dogshit.
ECU my opinion
Ferrari are dead set scumbags
That’s actually quite alarming that a certified Ferrari dealer mechanic didn’t initially change the battery and test it first being an obvious electrical issue.
Stick to watches , leave the car 🚙 to the experts 😂
Wait a second, emzo said in the frist video the battery might be the issue right at the beginning, didn't he?
I say put the original exhaust back on
As a mechanic who worked on a dealership (not saying every dealership are bad) never go back to the dealership, warranty is just something for the brand to hold their costumers...
alternator is the only thing left, id assume it would be this if everything else electrical has been checked, this should get checked urgently because it could kill the battery resulting in another new one being needed.
I hope you're mum is enjoying her recovery and gets well enough to travel to NYC to meet her idol the walrus she never had 😂
Bad earth
Dude, you seriously need to stop walking around when you're talking, you move so much it was making me sick to watch 🤢
10:48 oops you forgot a f bomb
Satisfying your ego, and then pushing that onto your son? You're the reason son, that I took all that money, and spent it in my ego? Do you really believe yourself when you say that? Take 10% of that a week, and either actually invest that in his future (not yours) or invest it in therapy, until you realise your mistake. Either one would be a healthy expression of love, and not a justification of an out of control ego...
I think you forgot to say that they checked every wire, every connection, every fuse?
Battery charging issues Ferrari needs to stand behind their product the exhaust can't have anything to do with it.
I know nothing about cars but strange how everytime you cross a border into a new country its changes , surely there's something in that car trying to connect to new networks in each country 🤔
And you Mr.Leonard are an absolute beauty  in your own regard ! I will look forward to watching all your automotive journeys 👌
this is why if you buy a car brand new you need too let the car stock for the next 4 years😂
Its always been the ECU
Monitor the battery volts, the faults will probably occur when the volts drop lower than they should. I would check that the battery fitted is A good B the correct one. If ok check alternator, that is meant to control the voltage, and if it's falling below spec that is suspect. You didn't mention how your mum is doing, I hope she is doing OK.
What is disturbing, is Ferrari didn't know how to diagnose a faulty battery! WTaF!
Alternator fault will destroy the battery, replacing the battery will only patch the problem. Good luck with it.
Hi Nico nice one. Have you checked out Caffeine and Machine? Would be worth a trip when you come to England!
I second all the comments about your mum's recovery....but I just feel that 812 needs yellow seat belts...Keep these coming we need some entertainment during the cold days and nights.
I agree the alternator isn’t working properly… voltage should drop and refill around 12.2 to 14.6v and sounds like it depletes and maybe the regulator isn’t functioning properly. Good luck mate
Best wishes for your mom.
Hope you get the car sorted bro and hope your mum is doing well 🙌🏽
So the Ferrari dealership, supposed to be the best ressource if information, couldnt figure it was a battery issue 🤔. They mentioned you were out of warranty...like an excuse to charge you for things you didnt need or were they just incompetent??
Jesus christ stand still man
Sounds like Mclaren problems.  Batteries these days are a huge pain in the ass for the weight savings.
Genuinely, one of the best videos I’ve watched is when Mat and you were on the way to Monaco. It’s the first time I ever saw or even heard of you. I immediately loved the way you were with both your car and any issues that arose. I’m glad your car is back up and running again and hope to see many more videos of it. And big shoutout to the big B for helping you with your mum. Hats off to you buddy keep up the good work 🙂
getting motion sickness from Nico's camera skills
Koop een auto die werkt. Wat ben je hier toch mee! Niets dan stress.
Sell it to Matt .

If you want reliability in a super car get Audi r8 or a Lexus IF I love Ferrari but never known anyone who has never had electric or heating issues
Surprising the ferrari dealers didn't check the basics
Ferrari don’t make batteries either 🤦‍♂️
Is the warranty void or not?
Feck that, ferrari are shite, you should have bought a lada riva, i seen one hit the roundabout in bangor and wrecked the roundabout, still drove on, with the money that cost you and the lack of help from ferrari, id be putting a horses head in the dealership managers bed, good luck with it fella.
Why does Nico become French when he sees his car again 😂
Jinxed
So I was right it's not the battery. I'm not an expert, but to me it looks like there's a short somewhere. Or it could be what the other guys in the comments are saying. or smt completely different xD
That took a minute
Still, no car lover floors a brand new car and does doughnuts at a service station.  You’re no petrolhead.
😅Altinator!!!
First time I watch a Nico video and don’t hear a perverted comment 🙏🏼 😂
As a current German Auto tech for one of the major Manufacturers , this gives me all the reason to never get a Ferrari. How come two Ferrari Dealerships and technicians were not able to check the BATTERY of all things?? 100% reason to never ever get one. Nico hope your mom is doing well. Cheers mate!   After watching the entire video..... some here are saying check your generator/alternator, it could be killing the battery by over charging it.
Imagine a "supercar" not woeking properly?  Hahha.  What a waste of $$$.  Ferrari is the Hublot of super cars!  Looks good. But sheit components inside.
I hate to say this because I love modifying cars. Enjoy the car in standard trim, still effing amazing! Then just enjoy it, as is. It's still such an amazing car, better than near enough anything else on the road. Or alternatively could it just be a case of a new alternator? If a new battery or charge, cures it for a while, I'd personally want to try an alternator. It could be that it breaks down under high load or heat. Whatever you do, enjoy it! 🎉
Hope,ur mom gets better. If ferrari quality that bad I woulb be damned.
Wow it’s a battery as we all know you need ever ready battery for any thing you donought
Who cares
It's the alternator all day long intermittent.
Probably a sound problem frequency from the exhaust  playing with ecu , and very complex electrical symptoms
So the Rolex of the car world, Brabus, helped fix your Hublot ? 🤣🤣🤣
Put it back to standard and see if it still persists
Fuck the haters, stay been you Nico...
First of all really hope your mum and dad are okay, your car is stunning and I’m sure you will get to thoroughly enjoy your pride and joy. 👍
You said in a previous video that Ferrari would honour the warranty if the car back to original spec. Why not put it back to original spec and have them fix it properly. It might be the alternator like others at, but they should sort it
Buddy you bought the Hublot of the car world coa you saw one when you were young.. like Ed Sheeran bought a Hublot as as his first luxury watch beinf the great collector he is today..
Nico is gunning for Matts job!! Lol!
it looks like u need a diat  so u get in shap
biggest yapper
If you tune it, you loose warranty it’s simple
thet provs thet  FERRARI is a shit  car
I'd say it's the alternator
Shouldn't the car know if the battery is low or wtf is wrong with it...
Nico, you're a legend my man
Sometimes it pays not to think out of the box glad you got it sorted keep going fella
Where are the professional Engineers who can look at the data and work out it’s the battery and precisely why? It’s not good enough that all dealer just chop and change black boxes randomly in the hope that the problem goes away but have no understanding of why. In my experience, I’ve never come across a dealer who can sit at a desk and study the schematic,  wiring diagrams, look at the data and understand what is happening. Most are just grease monkeys  who just waste your time and money and charge you for their incompetence.
Only a ferrari specialist or workshop can fix it
People dont love a ferrari, they love the idea of owning a ferrari. You can get better driving cars for cheaper.
Thats why you should really not modifi a ferrari
90% sure it’s the mobiliser. It’s connected to the computer of the car and if anything is not connected correctly or there is any fault in the mobiliser, the car starts to put all the lights up, since it doesn’t know what mobiliser is. Try to disconnect the mobiliser completely and see if the issues remain.
You’re living the dream buddy, however sometimes dreams can be expensive. Thanks for the great videos, there classic!🎉
Must be Europe thing that the last thing that’s checked is the battery,  in the states the battery is the absolute first thing that’s checked by anyone and everyone 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😊🙃
For Christ sake stand still I was getting motion sickness
I hope Mom is ok !!!!!  And I could use a few friends like that !!!
Alternator not charging properly at idle
I loved how you shared your feelings at Novitec parking lot.  I am also an owner of one.  Did the Taylor made program and after they declined the 19th request for personalization, I just had my dealer do the best they could.  Sucked, felt the same way you did about the brand.  Love it, it's just a human institution with its faults.  But Enzo would be the most proud of this car, it's the perfect car.  Only an owner knows this, seeing it, driving it, just walking by it in the garage.  Mine is at the dealer for its 2/7 services and I miss her like one of my kids at summer camp.  Its seems to me its the alternator, look at the volts of the battery.  Were you tricker charging it?  Wonder if you left it on the trickle charger over night then drive it and see.  If left 2 days alone, should place on the trickle charger.  I had many of the same errors after I changed to Novitec no GPF, sports cats.  Once I started leaving it on the trickle charger it went away.  I would take my daughter to her VB practice and sit in the car listening to music without engine, and when I started the engine errors would appear.   So watch the volts of battery on the left screen at startup then what it is when the error appears.  I bet you are under 13V at that time, so might mean the alternator isnt keeping up enough.  Or it's cold outside.  ""The Ferrari is not a car, it follows you and when you turn to look at it it always reminds you of who you were, who you are and who you want to become." "
Dam. Was sleeping on Nico’s channel, just subscribed to your channel mate!
Novitec took your original battery and  just put it back when they got it back
Novitech had to do it. Nico’s experience with his Ferrari made Novitech look bad. Novitech was operating out of self interest. Do be so naive
I hope your mother is ok and all is well, family is more important than anything❤
why wouldn't they just check the voltage on the battery??? surely that should be first port of call
Hope your mum is ok The car really does seem to be struggling to supply the correct voltage
Dude! everyone's fighting a battle you know nothing about! Thanks for sharing.
You know Vauxhall vans had similar problems that was traced to the batteries earth placement that was doing similar until they relocated earth to chassis my friend had this and was showing up all sort of warnings and powered steering intermittently failing ,electric steering ,I said to check the earth potential and they had to send to electronic tracing and guess what 🙈🤷‍♂️😂😂battery earth placement
Crazy all these high tech in these new cars and averyo e misses the basics as a problem the battery 😮
Nice watch though.
Nice one Nico 👍🏻
The potential earth between the alternator, battery and the alternator could be the fault so it may reappear
Dude stop smoking in the car.
i told you this 1month ago :#
Hope you’re Mums okay. Love to the family. Love the videos!💪glad you got your whip back. Junior watchmaker here.
Such a mug… drive it like a complete c*nt, it goes wrong and you’re renting it for £4k a month. Sucker. 🤦‍♂️
Well done Nico, You deserve every success. Your a lovely bloke. You are a bit marmite but fortunately I don’t mind it. Keep up your great work. You’ll always win. Topman
As ur talking you've left your lights on 🙄 have ya not learned ANYTHING 😂
Bloody battery !
Sincerely so Happy for you Nico.
the most honest man, You still post content while shit hits the fan. Big respect to you Nico
Hublot of super cars
If it eats the battery, check if it isn't overcharging. If it charging above 14,4V the battery gets broken.
At least the Smart car wasn’t Pink! 😅
Verkoop dat ding gewoon en koop een mooie Brabus van een man die jou op de moeilijkste momenten er wel was. Ferrari doet er alles aan om geen garantie te morten geven.
You know what they say Nico,”Never meet your heroes!”👍
Waffle waffle waffle.
Just let Matt fix it.. atleast he's a real mechanic .😋
It's an Italian car. Just place a very strong punch over the dash.... But VERY strong one. You can add some typical Maranello technical words as PORCODDDI00 !!! And she will magically be perfect again.
Thank God it was an easy fix. But you definitely need to let Ferrari have it for how they handled their side of the matter. You may just have a junk car, and that happens. You just need to get on Ferrari’s ass and have them get you a different car. Cause there’s no way you should have these issues with a brand new car, a Ferrari at that!Next you need to get a Lamborghini Huracán. Then come back to the US and hang out with DDE for a good month.
Received - not recieved. Good on Novitec.. Great PR. I'm surprised Ferrari didn't diagnose this and them washing their hands due to not being stock was not so good. Left you out of pocket. I wonder if the alternator is the issue. Does the Novitec tuning cause more of a draw on the electronics perhaps? Hope your Mum is doing well now too.
For what you paid for that 812 I personally would have expected Ferrari to be a little more forthcoming and help. Seems like the arrogance and stubbornness as shown in the Ferrari vs Lambo movie is still true today and saying there isn't a problem when there is clearly a factory fault just shows their true colors. GL mate. Hope you get it sorted at minimal cost as Ferrari seem to be dead in the water when it comes to helping you
Maybe the exhaust is shaking the electronics lmao jk. I know you don't want to have to spend unnecessary money but try changing out the Alternator! Maybe that's defective and shorting out the system.
I really hope you put it back to stock. You are confusing the computer system and how it interacts with the power train by modifying it. It might still have problems afterwards, but it will make the lives of your car and people working on it much easier if it was put back to how it was designed. These are complex systems like you said and they were designed to be a certain way. This stuff happens with all modern vehicles including trucks when you try to change things and the computer systems get confused.  I know you don’t want to throw shade on your friends who modified it but you can do it in a nice way and get your car back to the way it should be.
So... ferrari customer service is bad. A shame.
so u have money  but decided to make a YT channel to make more money ?
Get the alternator tested also you love the saying "shit the bed" ypu should look up  bunsters shit the bed hot sauce and their vodka is aussie made
Nico I’m glad your family is well and that Novitec showed what real customer service is. I’m a service manager in the auto industry and these new cars are electrical nightmares to work on. The charging system needs to be checked and monitored. One other tip is when modern batteries are replaced they have to be registered so the charging system does not overcharge them. This also needs to be investigated. I wish you well and hope that your local dealer will give you better support. No two dealers are the same and I would still pursue the dealer as an exhaust modification cannot completely void a vehicle warranty. Worst case get legal assistance. I hate going that route, but you as a consumer have rights that should not be violated. Cheers!
15:05 I love you
Germans had to fix it, 😂
Keep up with the car stuff. Comes natural to you
Seeing that Hyundai Ionic 5 in front of you in the queue sparked (pardon the pun) something in the back of my mind. They have a similar issue that is bringing on all sorts of warning lights and killing the 12v battery in a few weeks. Apparently it’s caused by “overactive unauthorized Bluelink use by 3rd party apps that is waking up the car too often." Basically, unauthorized third-party Bluelink apps are requesting information too frequently” - basically these apps are waking the car up - instead of maybe once every few hours they’re doing it once every couple of minutes, which is killing the 12v battery. Do you have any apps or software mods on the car that could be doing the same sort of thing?  There’s also a similar known fault with MINI, and presumably BMW, where the Comfort Access (keyless entry) system pings the remote fob too often, again like once every couple of minutes instead of once every hour, which again has a similar effect.  Hope this helps.
That’s your problem right there fella. You think Ferrari are the best in the world
Hope your mum is on the mend, no car, no watch, nothing is more important than family.  With regard to the car being modded, be awfy careful if it’s on finance 😳😳
If you had no modifications on that car, and Ferrari is turning you down, they are a bunch of scumbags, and I would never buy one of those cars if they did that to you
Mat Armstrong typa thumbnail
so you have 20 year credit on that car lol
I would get rid of that car asap. You’re going to so buried in mechanic bills because there’s something seriously wrong that people can’t figure out. Walk away from it.
I was holding my breath watching the driving towards the end of the video. I've had a similar experience. Driving back to Germany through France, Belgium and The Netherlands praying that the warning lights don't come on. Not in a Ferrari though, it was my old Alfa Romeo 159 Q4. I hope you find and fix the issue soon Nico.
Ferrari voiding the warranty because the car is modified when the issue has zero relation to the modification is still ridiculous though...
It must be the alternator, I bet it’s got one of those shit smart alternators in it
Pls like so Nico Can SEE                 I'm not a Ferrari technician by any means. However, I used to own a 458. I had it for 3 years. One day I did donuts in it and had the same problem that Nico is facing. I asked a lot of my friends who also owned Ferrari's and came to the same conclusion. If you do donuts in a Ferrari it goes complete haywire. Nico did Donuts a few months back when he was with Armstrong. I think this might be the issue. I don't know why, I don't know how, but all I  know is a lot of people face the same issues after doing donuts, including me. Pls like so Nico Can SEE!
I bought a second hand Audi R8 V10 Spyder (px from 911). Sounded amazing and was amazing to drive. But always issues that came up. So when you started or drove the car you were nervous the issues would appear. Took the fun out of it.
Maybe you need a barbus
Called it.  Same thing happened on my boss' Twin Turbo Viper.  If the battery cannot maintain the proper voltage, everything goes haywire.  Glad you got your beautiful 812 back!
Thanx Nico for the feedback, I am glad all is sorted out-So who is replacing the battery since Ferrari had excuses in the beginning? I am also not sure why they could not pick up the battery issue.
does Ferrari have can-bus connections?
after 8:50 of barely related shit chat you actually get to hear “what really happened”.
If you've financed it, and you think you own it, try skipping a few payments. Wait four months then tell me who owns it ;)
You drived and treated the car like an IDIOT, thats the problem. You dont handle that type of car that way especially when they are new. Are you jumping on your new Rolex when you have unpacking it. No, didnt think so. I was feeling really bad when I looked at your drive to France and actually thought, this will not end well with the car, and how right I had. Buy an old Volvo its more your driving skills and style.
Hope the next generation don’t mind all the fag ash on the b pillar.
I love all of nico's watch videos but for some reason hes annoying AF when it comes to cars
My guess is the alternator or the system for charging the battery,  some cars are adjusting charging voltage of the battery because when battery gets older it holds less charge than new one so it gives more voltage, to old battery it's good but when it get to the new one and system doesn't recognise or you don't manualy change the life of your battery in diagnostic tool to new one it pushes that adjusted amount of voltage to the battery thus frying it or causing overcharging problems.
Wow what a car and love that watch....hope your mum well to. Put that car back to stock and let Ferrari sort it..
Uho ho hohoooo
Something may be wrong within the charging system. Before replacing anything check if the main ground wires   are well connected,, should be metal to metal connected. Check the alternator next, your first  battery should have lasted at least 3 years if charging system is working perfectly.
I knew your cars fault straight away it happened to me 😂 want a private plate for that car ? GTO ? I’ve got one available look nice on that car
Nico glad u got ur dream come true. But Ferrari is , a . I wish I could swear enough for not fixing it. That's shit. I think the best man . Best brand came thru Bravis that need they . Sun to sign on them . Not saying novitec ain't great but Ferrari is shit for not fixing it ute a perfect example ur whole life could have changed and they left u try .so I'm saying fuck u Ferrari for not helping this man u make I'm say pretty cars not good cars and can't work on it shit cars that ur over charging cause of ur name. Thank u Bravis for being a good human. And showing love being a. Car company and it not ur problem. And also novetec
Suggest you put it back to stock.
Yep, all these new cars if the battery drops a % you will have issues, mine was my alternator
Congrats on fixing the issue with your Ferrari!!
That’s a beautiful car
VW R Green Viper Metallic = No issues 😂
You might need a wiring harness .
Respect to Brabus! Talking about the highest level of care! 🤌🏼
In the previous video, at the 30-second, the guy with the beard said it LOL.
Awesome video dude. SO! happy you got your car back and is somewhat working order. Lets really! hope the massive issue don't come back.
And you, my man, are a legend. Keep posting
That’s what good people get good thing from other good people .your the a champ .
thank you for being honest. whilst most of us probably couldn't afford to pay $4000 a month for a car its still good to understand that only a few people can pay outright for a car like that. and thay a lot of the cars you see on the road are financed. (great investment for your son though)
Novitec & Brabus amazing service and help !!! Ferrari Europe take note that is what customer service looks like !! 😉🤘
Car may not be under warranty BUT the I bet the Battery IS UNDER Warranty!  Ah, customer service...a certain company could learn a thing or two. Magnet or suction cup mount for camera? Dash Cam?
Ferrari is not a car brand they are a fashion brand. They could not care less about their customers.
I LOVE NICO's passion for the cars ! GOOD Taste NICO  THE  FERRARI  348  is  a MAN' Car
EVERY WIRE, EVERY PLUG, EVERY FUSE, EVERY CONNECTION, LOL!! ;-P  You're rambling Nico!!
If you think they are going to reinstate your warranty you’re in for another rude awakening.
Ferrari problems help you pay for it
All the best with your family especially your folks.  Sorry to hear your new dream toy is giving you ongoing issues.   Hopefully everything get all resolved and start enjoying it rather than headaches
Black wheels dont work mate glad the car is ok tho. Do something about the wheels pls get them polished
I imagine a Lusso, would be better choice.
Hope your Mam is feeling better thats the most important. Id imagine the alternator is causing your problems might be worth getting it checked
If you have problems with your Ferrari just buy a Porsche 🤷‍♂️
3:04 USD 107k Patek Philippe watch. Family first and keep your friends closer.
Question marks over ferrari Monaco. They looked at the car before they said it wasn't warrantied.
I had a car like that once, not a supercar obviously. But once they start behaving randomly like that, that anxiety never leaves you. Hope this story ends well!
What about alternator. Given new battery did help a bit it can very well be alternator giving out unstable voltage. Or not enough
IS there an alternator problem?....
what a story! Looking forward to seeing more of this channel!
So you modified a car that wasnt yours,  A Finance Company owns it
Great to see you get your wheels back mate. Time for another....hopefully uneventful...road trip with the boys 😊
Take it back to pure stock and let Ferrari fix the issues since the said they would reinstate the warranty.
Ferrari should at least give you a battery to make amends. Don't forget the biggest car legend Shmee
A failed genuine Ferrari battery, and Ferrari refused even to check it in their garage, just because of the warranty, that was voided by reversible mod. LOL
Hi, Nico, you need a good mechanic I have one he’s in Ireland in the north if you’re interested
Hard to believe people still buy Ferrari
No ferrari for me
it sounds like Ferrari  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ass
12v at alternator is not good fam. Need 13-13.5v…
🍋
Mate, remember going forward. Whenever you have electrical or electronic  issues especially these new cars that is one big computer you change the battery as first process of elimination. Secondary is check earth connections
Had a stilo 24v one, Fiat looked at it and the guy was Italian not one single thing wrong with it, they got all excited to see a 24v stilo. Anyway next thing every light on the dash, replaced the battery and boom fixed. Italian cars seem very sensitive to power shortages
Hi Niko, I love your content, and also wish the best for your family! Your problem with the car can probably be a solenoid placed under the brake pedal. I had a fiat 500 Abarth and I had the same issue. (It’s a common problem also because it’s a part that is commonly used on all of cars…) In my case, Lots of lights coming on the dash all in once and disappearing instantaneously…  On my car I replaced 3 times that solenoid (for the same problem)  And in conclusion is so difficult to scan the problem with a pc, also with a manufacture pc!!! It was a nightmare!!! Hope that helps!
What a shame for a legendary and giant company as Ferrari stopping your warranty cause second-part companies accessories are not finally the reason for your car and its their own genie battery. Ridiculous staff😤🤬😑
Hang in there, Nico.
Voiding the waranty  because you have another exhaust?  A 3 month old battery is broken  and no waranty?  By another brand , they need to get you a new one with all these errors  Christof from Belgium
Hope your mum is ok! Shout out to Constantine, my dad worked for Ferrari when I was born up till I was about 35 so they have a big place in my heart, but man  if I could ever afford one i doubt I'd even try now. But I'll never forget the days when my dad used to drop me off at school in Ferraris and we'd time it so me and my mate could get dropped off at peak time and then he'd go back and pick my sister and her friend up after. My dad drove 4 of us in a Testarossa once, 2 in the front seat, 2 in the tiny luggage rack behind the seats. Great memories!
Modern cars are marvels of innovations and absolute pieces of sh*t. All the electronics in modern cars give them so much functionality at the same time as they break down for any reason and you have almost 0% chance of being able to fix it yourself.
Do you get dizzy when you are on the phone
Novitech for the win on this one..👏🏽
Put the car back to stock.  New Ferrari does not like aftermarket exhausts.
why would a brand new ferrari battery need replacing? As you still have problems I would not be happy with this at all!!! Get back to ferrari and demand a full shake down
Dude it’s your alternator!!!!! If you put a genuine Ferrari battery in it when replaced,and still having issues. It is the alternator mate! Ferrari absolutely has to cover that. Call corporate. If your dealer is denying warranty always call corporate. Cheers buddy
For a moment let’s forget about your . Tell us your mum is doing well
Bet the battery is made by Varta and Ferrari 20x it lol! Cars are the most frustrating things. I don’t own a new Ferrari unfortunately but had a suspensions issue. Replaced all the suspension parts bar the new dampers and it turned out to be the new dampers 😂Lol
I’m pleased it’s sorted but the over and above stuff ….. come on …. You have significant social media reach. Course Novitech would go above and beyond as not handling it would have meant their reputation being dragged through the mud.
Rich ppl problems
Best wishes to you and enjoy the new car
I had the same problem with Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. Display was like christmas tree, change of battery solved it.
Love the fag ash on the B pillar LOL
Alternator nfg
could not happen to a nicer guy NOT LOUD MOUTH WASTE OF SPACE
Omg, after all the mental stress it was a battery 😮
I don’t know why anyone would ever buy a Ferrari??
Least your mate lent you a car mine wouldn't even give me a lift in one 😅
Hope your mother does all right, but man, I love to listen to your Watch Talk, it is funny, competent and provocative but cars and tuned Ferraris, what do you expect? The equivalent of your beloved Casio would be something like a Subaru or Toyota. The thing your are driving is on your own scale probably not much more than D** Sh**.
If your next car isnt a Brabus... youre a monster. Beautiful cars.
completely agree with Nico Ferrari is such a brand that you can instantly connect with Thier story legacy it's like God tier more of the patek Philippe of cars and tbh looking at what Nico has achieved it makes me motivated too cause even my first actual toy car was an Ferrari f430 in Rosso Corsa with tan interiors and the goal is to own a f430 scud and a couple or maybe a big collection of Ferrari's someday 🙌
That's so sad  that two different Ferrari dealerships couldn't figure out it was a bad battery. They went straight to blaming you when they couldn't figure it out. If I was you I would never buy another Ferrari after this.
With all due respect Nico... you car is SHAAAAAAAAITTTTT
If everything fails at the same time 9 out 0f 10 it's the battery 😂 on any car 😂
I fucking knew it was the battery. I wrote this in to comments.  Ferrari was so crap about it. Novitec so great. Battery can cause electronics going crazy when battery is shorting
Every fuse every wire every plug. 3 times. Pad that out . Bored.
Hmmm. Not impressed by Ferrari’s support to their customers or trying to wriggle out of a warranty claim by blaming an exhaust!!
really pleased your car is sorted 👍👍brill.  Watch front, my dream is Omega Planet Ocean, love Omega, one day 👍👍👍👍
Get a real job dude!
This will be ither faulty alternator leaking A/C voltage/undercharging once hot since its killing batteries. but its more likely the body control module fault not regulating the alternator. just get someone to scope the CAN network once lights come on.
Put all of the factory parts back on (temporarily) and let Ferrari foot the bill under warranty. There is an electrical gremlin somewhere that Novitec couldn't trace, could be a ground fault, or something somewhere in the harness. If Ferrari has to change out your entire wiring harness so be it! For everyone saying it's the alternator, obviously Novitec would have tested that.
Nico please  get a Gimbal
Glad I've come across your channel no nonsense talking! The thing that made me laugh was "the car shit the bed" which is something I say.  Glad it's sorted and you have your car back, poor showing on ferrari though to be honest. Even modified its not caused the battery to fail!
put the exhaust back and go ferrari for garranty
Now keep it on a trickle charger daily to keep the battery healthy.
.. seriously Nico, do you realize the error off a life you die buying such a piece off sh.t?!? This is all and completely ridiculous seriously 😒😒😒
Thank You Nico for sharing your story. There is a very personal side to this video and I Pray that Your Mom is well. Keep Your Head-Up and keep moving forward with creating content.
Alternator ???
Hi from Finland. I hope you mom is doing fine.
Just follow DDE advice buy a lamborghini than a ponyrarri!
Nico is the top G
What a nightmare, hope things get sorted soon!
Am a Ferrari owner myself and I remember saying it’s the car battery Ferrari batteries are a nightmare he should listen more to he’s followers but thank goodness it’s fix
Puhutko Suomea jos vanhempasi ovat suomesta?
Great watch, but does anybody else feel seasick? 🤢🤮
wow. that car is really crap
Would definitely check the alternator. That’s probably the problem
Hope your mum has recovered 🤞🤞I would put it back to standard and hand it back 'Not fit for purpose' as truly cool your car is, is it really worth that reliability.... do Ferrari have Friday cars 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂ I really hope Ferrari sort it for you .... they really really should
Nice of Ferrari to sell you an overpriced car, take seven months to get to you then ditch you on a ‘warranty’ trump card. Screw them and their treatment of customers. Ferrari have their heads so far up their own asses.
They should have tried checking every fuse, every wire and every connection…
Nico you’re one of most relatable guys on YouTube. Someone who came from nothing and worked his a#* off for everything. Inspirational brother✊ keep up the great content👌 watches and cars😍
BRABUS .... CEO ...... THE GOAT ,
Maybe something like the alternator killed the first battery and is now killing the second battery.
But did you check every connection every fuse every wire?
So sorry to hear the car is still not fixed... If anyone can find the fault its this guy @Diagnosedan
I had the same issue and went through 2 batteries and even upgraded it to a lithium battery (which made the error less frequent but still happened from time to time) after multiple trips to the dealer / (each time they said  it was an electronic fault which we addressed" and i suppose they reset errors on the ECU/ software updated etc.) they eventually changed the battery but problem persisted and  it was weeks until I came across someone else's experience that its a brake pedal sensor (some type a Bosch part that cost peanuts) - it seemed there were others with similiar experiences.. I suppose it was a small pool of owners but i insisted this to the dealer until they finally decided to check it and change the part and Voila! I now have the vehicle for 2 years and i have yet for the error to comeback. I highly suggest insisting this to the dealer, even if out of warranty the cost shouldn't have been more than 1k and since it was a vital part I only would've wanted it done through. Good luck with this, I'm almost certain your having the exact same issue as me and hope this will save you months of frustration...  keep in mind if you ever did get an error once in a blue moon (which will happen with these cars, turning it off and on will generally fix it) but this error was predominant and i understand why electronic error can always be confused and always the first though is battery alone as these cars are very sensitive to any electronic change (volts change, alternator etc), but somehow these pedal sensor errors don't seem to appear on the diagnostics and becomes a guess at this point...
Bros just told the same story 5 different ways
If you think Ferrari are so great then why did you feel the need to fu*k around with it. If you weren't on YouTube you'd have been screwed. They didn't charge you because they want you to big them up on YouTube, not because they are nice people, You can be sure as hell they'd have charged me. So full of it!!!
problem alternator!!!
excellent news..... :) glad it ended up just being a battery.....I also just gained a lot more respect for Novitec.... I hope everything worked out with your mom....
Nico Just Watch Jay Lenos very brief YT CLIP  AS TO WHY HE WILL NOT OWN A FERRARI. IT IS COMEDY GOLD BUT ALSO THE TRUTH… JUST SAYING.
Nico, the sooner you realize that cars are modes of transportation that are constantly subject to damage, the sooner you will stop pretending your penis is small and get yourself a nice mid range Mercedes or Audi and use them as disposables. It makes life much more fun.
Nobody actually wants a Tesla  😂
Ferrari as a company sucks!!! Bunch of  entitled stuck up wankers who thinks the sun shines out of their arses in my opinion!
Are those ash marks on you drivers window pillar.  Are you really smoking in a brand new Ferrari?
What's a Ferrari without a problem? 😄 (Boring! 😄)
Sometimes I think theirs just some things your  never meant to own
It's nice to have someone champion Belfast and Northern Ireland
Its missing the Hublot badge at the bonnet though😊
Shock that Ferrari lied to you hoping you would fork out big money so they could only replace the battery and pocket the profit.  This story is one that so many Ferrari customers have experienced, this is obviously a business model used to target wealthy individuals who don’t question what they are told.
It’s always the most simplest thing though isn’t it. Always check something simple first before checking all the wiring ;) otherwise you spend ages for no reason.   I work in a technical job and that’s always what I do and you’d be surprised how much that kind of mantra works
you should be driving a Vauxhall mate
turns out the battery was at fault.
brabus and novitec 😍
Nah its not good on Ferrari. Just abandoned you to your fate over a battery. I'll never buy Ferrari again 😂
Ferraris are top noch cars in the world, but so are their issues!!! Sorry for you. Hope you can get this sorted out somehow
Sorry for the second comment. But maybe Ferrari is right. Your car computer might be rejecting the upgrade. Maybe remove the upgrade and reset the computer to its original settings.
Good service keeps the customers happy and keeps them coming back and is satisfying for both. I travel the world doing training and I always go beyond and get great reports and also brings in extra business it's a win win for everyone and many ways no just for the $.
It wasn’t just a battery. There is something else, it will fail again.  Seems like a shitshow of amateur mechanics if a dealer and Novitec tell you that they checked every wire and connector, then just changed the battery and deleted the codes to fix it. Rule one is to try the easy stuff first. Suspect alternator also faulty.
I mean you're bitching about ferrari not fixing your car under warranty. But if i bought a datejust from you and fitted a diamond bezel i would invalidate the warranty with you even though i didnt modify the internals. I sell cars (and watches) for a living. DO NOT MODIFY YOUR CAR WHILE IN WARRANTY. (unless you have your big boy pants on)
Ferrari did let you down. They can not say that the warranty is cancelled due to exhaust installation. That has close to minimum impact on anything. Especially taking to account was from Novitec and they do know how to install the grear properly. Additionally when u spend so much on the car, you should be provided with the outstanding customer service and care. At least is sorted.
Hope your mums okay and doing well
Man your cutter needs some sleep.
You buy a Ferrari when you want to be someone. You buy a Lamborghini when you are someone & sir you are nothing but a Troll
Alternator / ground issue.
I think it’s great how honest you are it takes a lot too talk about the good and the bad. FairPlay bud
Got this video recommended to me by YouTube, never heard of you before and honestly the only thing I was left with at the end of the video is that I hope your mum is okay.
I still think this issue has happened due to the engine wash done at the PPF
Let me gues they checked every wire every fuse !!
Thats what you get for buying a Ferrari I guess meh nothing special 💀👀
Fuck Ferrari helping😂😂
Ferarri is a useless brand.. cheap build quality.. always has been always will be
What modification did he too?
Fek me what a pain in the arse for that amount of money you expect the car to work correctly, Ferrari need to sort that shit out
Is that fag ash up the side of the door? Ffs Nico don’t smoke in your 812!😂
I find it quite astounding that your disgusting blasphemy doesn't get bleeped out but the word "fucking" does..?
Crazy nobody changed the battery  straight away 😂😂😂
I know you love it but what a pain in the arse that car is, however it’s just a car can be replaced, family can’t and they always come  first,
Ffs stop repeating yerself man!!
Why don't you like EVs?😂? They are so good for the planet😂😂😂
what i dont understand, if everybody said its the battery, why the novitech guys check the batery first??
I had the same problem with my Mercedes black series P1 edition  Mercedes Benz in Australia melbourne worked it out in 1 day
Replace the alternator, the voltage regulator is likely the issue.
problem is at 8:50
Nico: "You can put a car back to stock." Then ask the boys at DDE if they can put their red Ferrari V12 back to stock.😜🤣
The damage done by Nico for the novitec brand is still high.. even if it had nothing to with novitec which can't be proven as we don't what mods they have done.
4:20 glitch in the matrix :)))
All modern cars are very sensitive to batteries. When random faults occur always recommend changing them out. But in this instance it probably just needed the car reprogramming to the battery.
for a brand new battery to go flat so fast. tells me there is an alternator problem. I predict this battery will go flat very quickly as well.  that or it was just a battery made in Italy (LOL) Nico ask ferrari to change the alternator and replace the belt as well. or very easilly take it to any auto electrician and ask him to verify the alternator is charging. takes 10 seconds and a multimeter
If it was mine I would sell it and buy a Porsche 911 Gt3 🎉
shows you how useless Ferrari is actually! Bunch of c unts
Yes Ferrari is a Great Brand but Porsche Makes Better Cars 👌
Had the same problem with a ford transit The Ford dealer wanted to charge $10,000 AUD  And that was the battery!!! I love your content You are a top guy  Cheers
Alternator
Your an ideiot
You need to gift jack a Rolex
Sometimes  toys break  it can be fixed and if its still getting  on your tits sell it and get a new toy till you find the toy that a keeper family  airloom that goes  with your favourite  watch and doesn't  fuck up all the time
Sounds like the battery isn’t charging properly. Could be a bad earth, a bad alternator or even something wrong with the belt.  What you need is a great auto electrician.
You must be on edge driving that thing wondering when is it next going to let you down. I hope you get it sussed fully soon so you can enjoy it without worrying. 😉 👍
But did they check every wire, every fuse and every connection?
@Nico Leonard MK2 I dont enjoy your profanity… not quite sure if you saw Jesus in real life, but that really just shows what’s at you heart. Bad taste
Ferrari have an amazing brand, built on generations of racing heritage and spend millions on marketing through F1. Then cancel your warranty due to some modifications….?  Shame on the pencil pushers who don’t respect the spirit of what built Ferrari in the first place. Sad.
Why on earth wouldn’t you just return the car to stock, starting with the exhaust. If the errors go away and don’t return after a few weeks of removing a modification, you know what caused it. If it turns out to be the immobiliser, the dealership will need to remove it or replace it for you.
Imagine paying top dollar for a car and the factory voiding your warranty for their shit work. So glad I won't ever being buying a Ferrari. Viva Lamborghini Aventador SVJ 😊
did they check every wire and every fuse and every plug? you never told us
I’ve seen faulty alternator’s cause similar issues with wrong voltage outputs intermittently but that’s in general modern cars nothing like a Ferrari but as it seems to be electrical/voltage related it might be worth monitoring when cold and hot after/during a drive cycle.
I’m really pleased for you mate. Finally you’ve got the car back!  You will get to the bottom of it all eventually. Hope to meet you one day so you can be in one of my videos! 👍🏻
Good to hear its working again. Mad its just the battery. Sometime its the simple things that's needs checking first
the real problem who ever is editing this video, I had to stop watching cause you kept retelling the same story over and over.  Tell it once and move on.  This 21 min video should be under 10.
good to see that I once pulled this man out of a fight, drunk, and dropped him off at home sleeping on the back of a scooter, now drive a Ferrari, and that was in 2005 😂 never forget where you came from Nico!
Haha!! That’s what happened to my q7! I couldn’t believe a battery could mess up a car like that!
The Ferrari dealership couldn’t replace the battery?   You mean to tell me they didn’t try a new battery ?   LMAO. Pull my leg.
beautiful car, beautiful spec
You buy your right to own it.     Is your car to do with as you please , within the T&C of your finance . Wouldn't  be surprised  if you will get a notification asking for full payment because they don't allow modifications
Get a Porsche instead. Better quality and WAY better customer service.
Check your charging system. Alternator,Voltage regulator etc... Something is messing with your battery
Now get rid of this italian junk and get a 911 from Brabus instead 😁
Omg the fat little Pom from DDE has a Chanel hahaha
Before cranking the engine let the the computer run for 15 20 seconds let everything start up and talk to each other then start the engine this most of the time will fix your problems same thing with turning it off engine off electronics 15 20 seconds then completely off its like pulling the plug on a running pc it will freak out hope this helps mate
Lol it would be the fuckin battery after all of that 😂😂😂😂
Bro sell it, why keep going through that ?
The way ferrari fucks up their customers is insane 😂
get a antigravity h7/94r 80ah  this seems like power is not getting enough thru somewhere module/sensors and wreck havoc to canbus system and check every inch of the harnesses, some loose ground, knicked wire , loose connection
whats with all these stock images
play around win stupid prizes
Your my favorite Bellend....
Baller time check Y'Bollocox.
I bet the alternator is having a random short either caused by moisture, vibration, something loose or just going bad and under and/or over charging the battery. I guess bad grounds could cause ur issues too but if all the wiring has been cheeked multiple times already I'm leaving towards the alternator causing low voltage when idling or shutting off and causing all ur alarms/codes. Sweet car, hope u get it behaving soon!
Imma be honest. I drive a 10K 10yr old car and have never had issues like this. If I bought Insert "luxury/sport brand here" I would expect it to work flawlessly.
Nico you've have 248k views in 48hrs. Keep it up mate from Aus., we love your video's and hope you make it massive. I can see the Ciggie ash on the window rubber, give them up for your sons sake.
Allot of times there are 2 even at times 3 batteries in those cars. Could have messed up more then one
You should have bought a Porsche
bro stop walking around with the camera in circles. i felt like i was on a rollercoaster. i had to close my eyes and just listen to you talk. (sounds wrong)
Repeatedly saying the same things and mostly waffling but other than that a good video 😊
fuck ferrari - finicky unicorns
Sorry for the money why deal with that aggravation.
I love this guy,the way he jumped into his whip 😂😂❤
the time has come ... buy a Toyota and go bonkers with modification ... you'll have something that can leave the Ferrari eating peanuts.
Ferrari is defs not worth the hype
Wow
Disconnect any phone chargers that you have plugged into the car outlets
Wait... you *financed* a Ferrari?!?! You have chosen... unwisely
Am i drunk or are you repeating yourself again and again and again … Jesus never Seen a video of repetitive info 😅
camera stabilizer....
Awful to watch with so many cuts on the edit.
Long story short: he sold it for a watch.
fuck that car, it's actually a bunch of iron and plastic. human life is more important and cannot be fixed as easy. how is your mom , Nico? I hope she is doing well
Did you pay for it ?
Would never ever buy a Ferrari. This is one of dozens of stories of pure incompetence I’ve heard. Useless company
bro i work at a dealership and you dont have to check every plug and connector you literally just plug in the obd2 diag tool and it literally will tell you battery fault...... its not that deep brah
This could have been a 5-minute video but why you spent 20 minutes padding the video out with complete shit and waffling I have no idea. I certainly won't be subscribing to this crap
Buy a Porsche next time.  Ferrari are known to be overbearing wankers who want to tell owners of their cars what they can and can't do with a car all the while offering piss poor build quality and aftersales care.    Ferrari's legal dept must be the busiest office at Ferrari HQ.
Champagne lifestyle on a lemonade budget. You reap what you sow.
you should by a barbs bro
Ferrari = Hublot
Sell the piece of crap and buy a Porsche 911 TurboS
Nico, I'm glad it was something simple, the battery is a very temperamental piece on the Ferrari. I would like to know one thing, why did you make this whole vlog with the 812 sitting there not running with the lights on?!?!?! LOL  (tail lights anyway)
Well done, love the videos and enjoy your passion....
I also went through every wire, every fuse and every connector =]
Sounds like the inteligent battery management sensor is not very inteligent.  Could explain all the issues and they don`t show up on a diagnostic.
U might want to replace ur ecu even tho they say it's not the problem... there is only a few things that can cause that problem and the ECU is more then likely ur problem.. it could be a bad condition inside with a solid point
Had the same on my old Volvo in Norway - didn’t drive enough during lockdown, then the cold in Norway shagged the battery, then Christmas tree action😅🎄. Modern cars don’t work without juice and they don’t work in ways you wouldn’t expect - warning lights on, speedometer showing half the speed, brakes and steering not working properly. Good luck getting back to Ireland.
voltage regulator or alternator , you mentioned when u slow down the issues start , seems when the voltage drops with engine RPM , some of the computers fails , they need a specific amount of power  constantly , had similar thing with my BMW , used to have transmission fault everytime the engine is off and I have the ignition on , constant power is essential for those cars with many computers . Im almost certian its a power source issue , otherwise why different computers fails at the same time
Heerlijk om opeens heel duidelijk BAM (nederlandse uitspraak) en de nederlandse plaatsnamen te horen.  Nico ten eerste hoop ik dat het beter gaat met je moeder. Familie is het belangrijkste. Ik geniet van hoe lekker nuchter  oprecht en recht voor ze raap je bent/overkomt (toch weer die nederlandse roots)  leuke content, heerlijk om je bij menig grote youtuber voorbij te zien komen. succes met je nieuwe kanaal en de auto  ( ben geen auto monteur, maar gezien de problemen met de accu, ook na het vervangen er van zou je toch aan de dynamo gaan denken)  fijn weekend,
Sounds like the car is pulling more power than needed try a Anti Gravity battery!
I absolutely love that delivery of your Ferrari
Ferrari are one of the worst car brands not best. They make desirable cars not reliable cars.
You must have a good job
The degenerates at ferrari monaco ratted you out when they saw you had a custom exhaust
Hi Nic ur reunited with the car and to find it to be only the battery FFS at least you was able to link up with ur parents while while they try to diagnose the probs with the car u can now have a good old crack with the car success thanks to Novitec.
The issue is with the exhaust system. The Air-mass-meter (the original) expects a certain amount of air to flow through from the air intake. If it doesn't match the standard values it's going to show a lot of errors.  I've had this issue with a car I owned back in the days that I tuned and this is a pretty known issue. Same goes if you've swapped the air filter.
Glad you got it back and sounding incredible as ever. Someday I'll have one, or maybe go Lambo lol. Working on it. Keep the videos coming, and keep hustling brother.
Ferrari need to fix this and stop being dicks. The way they have treated Nico is not a good look for them.
How a brand new supercar gets into  those sort of problems straight from factory? Ferarri has lost most of my credibility by now.
So how much did the battery cost you lololoo
Hey man, we are really happy to see you back on the road, we were all pulling for you.
So there was nothing that load testing the battery would reveal?
You are brilliant and you're friends are legendary
try  to change the battery and the  alternator  at the same time
So, you now have a fucked £4k a month car that Ferrari has no disowned?  Oops!
What’s going on with your accent?! Are you Irish or American?
Ship it to DDE HQ and have the infamous Essa fix it🎉🎉🎉
I think I was one of those pointing out to something simple like battery or bad connection (and definitively NOT a module - engine or body computer - ). I've experienced exactly the same with my Giulia with a weak battery ;) Still: BAD BAD idea to mod a Ferrari while the warranty is valid...
I'm a Field Technical Specialist for an auto manufacturer. I travel the country just to fix these hard to repair cars. While I won't say who I work for, I will say it definitely isn't for Ferrari lol. I'd love to dig in to something like this!
I would definitely check the alternator
ferrari lookin like clowns on the grid and the street. shout out to brabus and novitec
I said battery from day one. I was screaming at my phone for that battery to be load tested. All of those symptoms screamed computers being unhappy with the voltage!!!!
I said it back then, you've got a problem with a ground wire. It's making imperfect contact with metal. This can be diagnosed, will take just a few hours to find the wire.
I am a mechanic - This is so much more common then a lot of people realise.  And people cant seem to understand that they need a battery (because their car still starts ok etc)
but how did a 3 month old battery die? was it overcharged? was it poorly assembled in a factory? how did the battery die? as i think its broken when it left the factory a so called assembly error in the battery as my parents had an assembly error on a gearbox of their suzuki liana something wasnt assembled right and at a certain time after driving it kept popping out a 5th gear and it kept doing that while we where in italy for 1 more week i think it was the week my grandmother died so my father driven back with a broken 5th after a time driving 4th started doing the same 3th was worn heavyly the dealer said as after my father drove it back to italy and then back to the netherlands and then the car went straight to the dealership and the concluded the gearbox had an assembly error somewhere so suzuki paid the bill as the car was in waranty and a few years later it was traded in for a toyota urban cruiser after the suzuki had new issues and the dealer being like the suzukis fine well it wasnt as it got towed to a dealer in italy of all places and the said 2 sensores failed but the dealer in the netherlands failed to diagnose the issue but the gearbox had an factory assembly error so i think the battery on your 812 was assembled wrongly
Your Ferrari make"s more noise than you Nico. 🤭, But, a fast recovery for your mother.
2 weeks to decide to change the battery..! I thought that would have been step 1. As for changing it back to stock, the cars computer would know you've changed the exhaust because of the emissions, which is probably the fault you have now.  If I changed the crown on a watch to an after market one and I couldn't then manually wind it, would the watch still be under warranty? The ability to put something back to stock doesn't validate the warranty
Shit Nico, you might need to put all the original stuff back on.
seriously mate that's a waste of my time honestly get a real job
Had issues like that with my F12. Installed a Varta battery that has a 42month warranty. Trickle charger on 24/7. End of problems.
What a shite advertisement for Ferrari this car and these videos have been,yes its a beautiful looking car and will go like fuk when its all in good order,but to be shelling out 4 grand a month for constant problems with a new car is totally unacceptable,stressful stuff that you just dont need in your life,and how you going to get it out it now, everybody has seen the videos n know its fucked.just do an insurance job on it n move on mate 😂
My guess is alternator or a frayed / short somewhere near the ECU - (or it could be a faulty ECU).  Have you downloaded all the codes when it goes awol?  Also … check the ground wire for bad contact / connection.
Can you not just take the car back? They should take it back, right?
Great videos and great u got the Ferrari sorted and also ur mother is recovery. Jesus that sound off the 812 is savage and novitec is top notch
Lol Ferrari 😂
I’m wondering if it’s not electrical wiring’s then possibly you may have a glitch within the software of the car can you not RE flash the ECM and ECU WITH FRESH firmware
I mean i understand your love for the brand, but they did leave you out to dry. Novitec went beyond their own service and checked everything...that what real service is. The car is brand new and Ferrari should have done more than telling you your wareanty is at fault because you put a novitec system on it. They just didnt know what the problem was and thats when they told you basically to f..k off and seek help somewhere else. You are very forgiving to them and that makes you a better person for it. In the end its still a beautiful car and i hope you have more luck in the future with it.
maybe can be  the alternator control unit?? its not common but can happen
You’d think alternator 🤔
Just sell that Ferrari mate and buy a FIAT and you are good to go mate 😅
That’s a bonkers mix of accents. Pure Belfast mixed either pure Amsterdam. :)
Stockholm syndrome
I would do if I own a car like that it would be the exhaust anything else is way too sketchy and if any issues arise theyll void the warranty
No offense to Novitec , But they are 10000000% responsible for this whole problem! Ferarris are one of the most sensative cars to modify!!!! Millimeters of diameter in exhaust , and every fuel trim tune all must be Absolutely 💯 👌🏽 perfect!!! Next time break your car in before ANY MODS!!! I'D PUT IT BACK TO STOCK , AND DRIVE IT. Then go from there Sir! This could ALL BE 1 LOOSE GROUND WIRE FROM FACTORY..Intermittent problems usually a ground or loose wire... put er to stock mate , and CALL ALEX AT GINTANI ONLY ONE WHO'S GOT SHIT DIALED IN FAM.   PUT IT TO STOCK MUCH LOVE 20:59
Same happened to me on my 2012 Volvo XC60. Battery replacement fixed it!
just put it back to stock
What’s aftermarket on the Ferrari?
I think Ferrari will always have issues with their cars just like BMW does, just on a higher and more expensive scale. Especially if you have one that cursed with weird problems - which you seem to have at the moment. I'd think Ferrari should honor your business and give you a replacement 812, while they fully dis-assesmble and diagnose your current 812 - IMHO
Best wished to you MoM ❤❤❤🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 3:33
Nuff said skid Marks!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 You bought a Ferrari!!! The money you paid, was just the initiation cost..  And now you're paying the price!
car broken because of batt, Nico:  Leaves the lights on.......
Mega video Nico!!! A guy who loves cars!
Ferrari is garbage always has been always will be you get what you deserve when you buy a Ferrari
my fiat the same thing happened
I randomly had subtitles on and the scene were he's pulling out of the Novitec garage all you can hear is the sound of the exhaust.  The subtitle text interepted that as music. I couldn't agree more. Lol
Let's just say that you have not learnt your lesson about your battery going flat you've just talked for 10 to15 minutes with your vehicle lights on lol 😂draining the battery also Nico buy yourself a trickle charger for when you get home and leave it in the garage of your house plug it in every night just to be on the safe side
I bet Ferrari still won't give a 💩
Work hard play hard reap the reward! Good for you mate! Had same battery issue with my motor because the garage had put a non branded Landover battery on! Something dodgy going on! Live life dance like you're na boat!
Good man Nico! 1000th comment!
I had the same problem with an 812 superfast but Ferrari US was able to fix in less than one hour. Sorry for your trouble but the car you bought is the best Ferrari I ever drive, forza Ferrari
A Dutch YouTuber had de same issue with his Ferrari, also same story. Ferrari couldn’t find a problem until they checked the battery 🔋. Conclusion Ferrari battery 🪫 are shit 💩 13:31
Excelent service from Novitec , congratulatioms to that company😊
Your health is your wealth
The guy is rubbish and sold a crap Rolex to Matt
Any cheap modern car with electronic will have everything fail when the battery is gone. It's surprising Ferrari wouldn't check the battery straight aeay. And voiding your warranty just for an exhaust is a joke. Enjoy the car!
Non of these beautiful cars deserve such ignorant owners doing donuts 💩
Brabus and Novitec are stand up guys. Fck Ferrari. Dealing with Ferrari is like dealing with Rolex ADs.
Its a heap of 💩 to begin with.
The lesson here is, don't touch a Ferrari and hundreds of owners will testify to that fact. They look great, sound great, but are a heap of sh!te.
so you could just have bought a new battery in tesco
To eliminate the aftermarket parts. Put it back to stock see what it does. Does sound electrical tho mechanical faults are never really intermittent from my expierience
Charging system is having issues.
You schould GET RID of this beauty PIECE OF CRAP...If you get nice R34 GTR will be much better choice then FERRARI witch never works...
Hope Mom is well!!! 🙏🏻🫶🏻
Ferrari sucks everyone should turn their back on them
Not very helpful fun fact: I'm driving an Alfa Romeo Giulia. The engine is from Ferrari and... guess what? That one Ferrari part is randomly throwing errors at me. Every couple of months the engine light goes on and a few days later the error just disappears. They checked everything and even changed the ECU. It didn't help and the car is still throwing that "check engine" message at me. It feels weird, but I've learned to just ignore it. Car's running fine (Start/Stop isn't available when the error shows up, that's all), it just loves to occasionally show that error for no reason... Must be a Ferrari thing 😜
Nico, thank you for being so genuine. One love yall!
Invest in a multimeter.
Get a lexus LC500
armstrongs initial assessment was correct, when it lights up like a christmas tree, its battery and or alternator. very common in bmws, low voltage the whole car will throw a fit
Uhhh it was built by Italians? 😂
You should’ve known when the steering wheel was on the wrong side.
Nico... dont try to be anyone else.... just be YOU!! Thats why we WATCH you! Im not a massive rarri fan but your 812 looks and sounds  wicked. Top job dude.
Didn’t the first Italian roadside assistance mechanic tell you it was the battery?!
Should of bought a Toyota.
Prayers to your Mother my friend!!!
Pro tip: NEVER buy anything from Ferrari!
Epic respect GGG -unit family dammmmmm that car
Absolutely beautiful car.  Hope they figure out the headaches you are experiencing-cheers🥃
I absolutely love you man, I started watching you on your watch channel a few years back and I couldn't believe it when I saw you pop up on Mat's Channel because y'all couldn't be more different considering the type of content each of you make. But I was glad to see you from a different perspective  Hoping that the channel will start growing as well as attract more views which could push you to start doing more car related talent💪😂  Wishing your mom good health 🙏
Maybe putting a lower amp hour battery in the car will make the fault worst to aid fault finding.  You could start the car with a battery booster box then remove it when running. Could be something is shorting out intermittently or a relay/inductor is producing a back EMF when switching off. Could drive the car across bumps to check it is not linked to vibration.
My man is in Ferrari with a neck pillow…wtf
These cars are basura.  Get rid of it, mate.
Happy about the fix, but ill be making game a shot taking game for every time you said wire, fuse, plug and connections 😂
Good Luck Nico with your 812
Nico i am going to hazard a guess where your problem with the car is ___ you have an issue that DDE had with the twin turbo 812 i think it was and damon did some donuts with it and the car went mental, Take a look at the rear wheel hubs and check the ABS sensors as well as the speed sensors, You have an error for the ESP and that normally pops up when the ABS ring gear on the drive spline maybe has a tooth missing. or the sensors are knackered, Also you have a drain on the battery which seems to be coming from a bad ground on the car somewhere in the engine bay ==either the alternator is okay and the voltage regulator on the back of it has gone pop or the start relay has an issue which is not turning the electrics off 100%.
Faulty alternator probably over charging the battery and causing the cells to short
It's a Sugar Car, the best!
Glad your mums better, material objects pale into insignificance in circumstances like that. Hope you get it sorted soon 👍🏻
nice one u got the battery sorted my moneys on a charging system fault possibly the alternator i reckon the faults will re appear when ur using the most electrical system ie lights heaters etc try banging everything on ike headlights , heater fan on full etc see if the faul comes back
You have the money to buy a Ferrari 812 GTS, but you don't pay the photographers for the images you use in the videos you monetize. I like you, Nico. Think about it. You're better than that.
Life throws us all some humbling moments and you have dealt with these ones well.
Have you got a ghost immobilizer fitted to the vehicle, I reckon this is causing faults with the CAN network
Succes with the car. But how is your mom doing is she recovering? Love the videos this and the watch videos getting more and more into watches because of you.
At least the battery is under warranty 😂👍! Top marks to Novitec 👍
My M5 had the exact same problem, the modern electrical system uses micro voltage sensing to communicate down cables, this cuts down the quantity and weight of cable required, however if there is anything slightly off in the electrical system it causes the chaos you are experiencing due to slight variations in the voltage. The solution was changing the battery and the alternator at the same time.
I think the best thing to do is put it back to stock and get all the problems taken care of then put at least 2 to three thousand miles on it before changing it back
Anyone would start with the battery it's the cheapest part to start, probably the alternator not giving the enough voltage.
Good onya nico all the best to ya fella .the car looks amazing  and sounds wicked .Good luck ❤
Im here for this whole journey, loved all the watch content and im so glad you now do cars content
Hard to believe that noone tested the battery. With weird electrical issues it's one of the first things i do
Big up novitec👊🙌
I hope Ferrari give you your warranty back
If the car is still giving problems call  novitech and ask did they check the alternator power output? it seems that it works for a certain amount of time,the battery is not getting enough charge to keep the power levels up? The strange thing is most people who buy these cars do not drive them,they will not put thousands of miles on the clock as that will affect the selling price.If you wanted a car that you could use every day you should have bought a porsche,ferrari's are just unreliable cars,already you will have that in your mind everytime you go out in it.
Stressful! Pleased you're sorted :)
I'm leaning alternator...
Brabus.....one day....I'm buying from you.
I reckon it's the alternator pal
First issue you have a “man” smoking a vape with a neck pillow!!! No wonder the car is playing up. I would to if I was carrying that around.
Regulator on the alternator, I’d put money on it.
Na, ill hit up samcrac instead
Park it in the centre of London, have it stolen. Claim the insurance, and get another one. Everyone wins
Try this: Plug 812 into the trickle charger, let it get to 100% unplug and go for a drive. Look for errors. (You might not have any) Then try this: Let 812 sit for a day, _don't_ plug in to the trickle, and go for a drive. If this results in errors, you've likely got a charging problem &/or a power drain problem.
I would say the ecu needs a deep clean with a specialist Ferrari obd scanner after the battery being changed. The faults will be logged in the ecu brain despite clearing the codes. Top end autel scanners do this for cars but think you would need a Ferrari specific machine (I may be wrong but haven’t got my autel to hand). It’s common to have these errors after a battery change as it jibs the electrics out. Mercedes are prone to doing similar. I would say doing a car channel is great as it would be a perfect niche for you where you aren’t following other people’s ideas and providing your own content, would be a refreshing change in a saturated world. Hope you get it sorted drama free and life gives you a lot of luck for 2024 :-)
Hope your mom is okay ❤
What an absolute PITA!  My money is on a loose ground wire somewhere.  That can show itself intermittantly.  Bestbof luck!
Anyone thinking of buying a Ferrari don’t and make them think again about their customer service.
I'd look at the alternator.  The other thing I'd do is get my attorney to start putting pressure on Ferrari.  The whole warranty thing is horseshit.
I hope your mum is doing better! Thoughts and prayers to you guys! 🙏🏼  I'm not much of a car guy but i hope you will get to fully enjoy it soon! ✌🏼☮️⌚
Your phone is hacked and they are pigging back onto the car.
Could of things, changing the battery solved your electrical problems for the moment, but later some issues returned. Couple of things.  Those cars need a trickle charger at night to keep the battery at 100%. Usually a CTek trickle charger will keep you ok. But your was driving for a while and then problems returned. That leading towards the alternator. Means your engine was running off the engine draining the new battery from the 100% charge to a lower charge.  Many times with things added to the car, the amps needed go up from stock. I would test the electrical system and see if your alternator is handling the current state of the car. A amps test will show if the alternator is pimping out 14-16 volts to keep the computers happy. Check that out, it's one thing less you have to look into.  A real good mechanic would look into that.  All the things you mentioned, most would do, unless they dig deeper. Good luck with it.
I just want a Carrera T in manual !!!
Im 14 min in an you still haven't said if mom is ok . What the phuck Nico dont tell us mom is in a tuff state an leave us hanging ... Oh yeah an your lemon Ferrari probably needs an alternator..
I can’t wait to see this journey
buy corvette
Lemon law?
So so glad ur mum is ok
love ubwith us in northern Ireland if u defo love driving ur car go over look at driven page ni based supercar group they are amazing done alot dor myself james & William who run it are legends.
That car has a fault. There is a bad connection somewhere. Even if every connection has been checked for continuity with the plugs disconnected the continuity wouldn’t be valid test. If the faults are coming back there is a current drain somewhere. A real head scratcher.
been waiting on this video for weeks!
All this trouble, effort, and wasted time over a stupid car and horrible brand that treat its customers like sht.  Just get a Toyota and done for 10 years, the amount of time people waste on stupid crap always amaze me.
Hope you can get it sorted once and for all Nico, its a beautiful 812. Really hope your mum is recovering well, i know what its like when the parents get ill, heartbreaking. Novitec, seems like a great company, seems like they are proper car enthusiasts first and foremost and just good guys. Props to them 😊
Hi Nico, You need to immediately distance yourself from Liz and Darby. They are about to be charged with their connection with Anthony's scandal. Do not risk your reputation for the sake of a clicks on a YouTube video. We love you and wish you only the very best, PS: We're thrilled you got your car back! Replace the Alternator! Enjoy!
Brill mate ❤
Those front engine v12 Ferrari problems.
Nico your mums travail & seeing what you did.  Mum comes first. I AM NOW A CLIENT.  You deserve all that you have. Pls cherish every moment you can with her.  Youre a man after my own heart.
Ecu it has to be at this point if what he said is true they went through everything then inthink swapping out the ecu would be a good next step
you really know who your freinds are when it hits the fan. glad they came through for you when it mattered
Nico, glad the car made it back. I’m watching this closely, because my new 812 GTS was just built and hasn’t even shipped yet. Really keen to see whether the problem turns out to be the exhaust or not. PS - hoping your mother is improving✌️
Much love to you and your channel Nico, I've a huge passion for cars too, keep up the vidoes
Clever by novitec.   I can't imagine the German police not stopping you though. On the motorcycle you always needed the papers to prove your exhaust was stock. I had an akra and luckily it was stock.
Nico, hit me up/I'll get you partnered with CTEK chargers. They already work with a ton of your colleagues and are OEM for brands including Ferrari... They'd love to hear and share this. Huge fan, be well and keep up the great content!
@nico Leonard mk2 you bought the hublot of the sports car world.  The fact Ferrari won’t stand behind there brand says enough. Why do you think Jay Leno doesn’t own any.
Hi I think your problem could be the Alarm. I think I heard you say you had a vodaphone alarm.  I had it romoved as it gave me loads of problems with my mustang 5.0 GT.   I got so fed up with the alarm.  Hope you get it fixed.
Your flexing and lifestyle seems to be mirroring that of Anthony Farrer.   Watch this space!
Bloody battery....ffs😂
If you was such a car expert then you would know that these cars spend more days in the garage then on the roads. Just buy a old Smart 😅, only experts will catch this joke! 😂
So, After all this, We still dont know what happened to your Ferrari.
Glad everything worked out!
Hi Nico,Check the Output voltage of the alternator.Both  by code scanning and by voltage meter.My Lexus was giving me Abs warning lights and it turns out the alternator was giving out 13.87 volts not 14.4 volts.This caused my ABS light to flash twice after starting indicating a voltage issue.It still kept the battery charged.Might be something worth investigating.I had to have a new Alternator.Hope that may be of use.Ed.
Nico love the fresh fade
So alternator?
Did you say “ they went through every wire, every plug , every connection!” ?😂
Lots of comments about how great Novitech is for standing by their product. Do they have a choice? It’s a limited market and it’s videos like these that are some of their best press. Ferrari won’t feel any pressure in this situation because one, it’s likely an issue caused by the modifications/tuning, and two, Ferrari’s brand is strong enough to sustain this story. Also, at the end of this video Nico says he still is getting the lights, which means it’s only a matter of time before limp mode comes back. He needs to GET THE NOVITECH SYSTEM OUT OF THERE. PERIOD. It doesn’t matter how reputable and helpful Novitech are… it’s their equipment and tune that likely caused the issue, directly or indirectly (because it voids the warranty). And Ferrari will be of no help until that system and tune is off the car. There are only 500 812 GTS’s. So statistically, how many times has Novitech installed these systems for this exact car before? 10 times, maybe? You are a guinea pig when those are the numbers. The car’s brain is scrambled, the car needs a new one, but you should not put a new one in until all the Novitech shit is out of there. It’ll cost a lot of money in parts, not including programming, and not including labor. But you know what’s more expensive? A $700,000 car that throws up dozens of warnings and goes into limp mode at random. It sucks, and no decent person who works hard and is simply trying to celebrate the fruits of their labor deserves these expensive inconveniences… I feel for anyone with these issues (been there). But modifying a brand new, under warranty super car is always a gamble… And the most reasonable thing to do is admit the modification is likely the problem and revert to stock. Otherwise it’s just going to be a wild goose chase. I hope Nico gets it sorted… it’s an amazing car, and this isn’t the experience he should be having with it. And for what it’s worth, the Ferrari community is pretty tight and limited, and I haven’t heard of many major issues with the 812 GTS…
Ferrari should be ashamed of themselves. This is damaging to their brand and I must say makes me wary of buying one. Hope it gets sorted soon.
Hey Nico This sounds like an alternator problem maby its charging but just not enough
You deserve all the luck in the world with your hard work buddy keep going pal, Yorkshire Lee.x
Novitec are not very good if it took them 2.5 weeks to determine that battery was faulty ? You check the voltage and discharge rate and know if it needs to be replaced  ...
Ferrari head office, shame on you for typically deserting the customer, well done Novitec.
And novitech dont check the battery after two weeks 🤷🏻‍♂️
I wouldn't pay Ferrari for a battery especially after them voiding the warranty. Anyway, their batteries will just be something standard with their sticker on it. Shouldn't cost more than 80 quid I reckon. Something faulty with the alternator can put electrics in a car mental also. As well as that it might be a good idea to be careful with where you park it just in case its some kind of electrical problem which could cause a fire.
I'm glad we get to join you on this journey i really do hope the ferrari is up and running again soon
So Novitec didn’t fix diddly dub?
Ferrari might be a great car but their customer service is the absolute worst. Because they think their shit don't stink and it was what you did to it was the problem.
Why don’t you ice out the car?
You should've bought one of the nice Porsches instead , you dodged god tier for Ferrari , shame is like you bought the Hublot of cars
This story will make you love it more. I'm glad it was just a battery. Congrats on the dream achieved.
I think it has already been said, clearly the battery change made a difference pointing you toward it being about voltage. With that obvious comment, it would be worth trying on a new alternator to see if that changes anything. Last but not least, I assume you will just have to put the car back to stock and see what that does. If it is a mystery to all of those Ferrari experts we just here to make guesses on your behalf and look forward to the final result when it is fixed. Stay at it!
This is a case for @diagnosedan
Nico we love you because you love what you do!! Don’t care if you are an expert or what!!! Keep pushing good lad!!!
Be careful using the stock images with watermarks. You don’t want more bad luck from the image companies…
Man I hear you, I’m a lad from a council estate driving a Ferrari. It made me wonder and kinda freak out why am I worthy. U won’t ever understand or answer that q, neither will I.
alternator, voltage regulator or intermittent bad ground.. and has ferrari reinstated your warranty, if not you should stop your payments ..
Just a guess but I have a feeling it might be the Voltage regulator on the alternator, if that’s temperamental/ not working properly then that can create a load of errors/lights on the dash
Enjoy life and hope the moms is well sending luv all the way from SA 🇿🇦
So glad you fixed the car and I love you watch videos as I love watches but unfortunately can’t afford what I would like but am. Ow saving for a watch so fingers crossed and good luck with everything thing and I admire are hard worker
Whit hindsight it was obvious it was the battery , especially when on the rally you had to boost the battery to start the car I honestly suspected the battery. I’m surprised the Ferrari dealer (in Italy 🇮🇹 🤷‍♂️) didn’t try a new battery when you told them what happened to you and the car on the rally. Glad you got it back fixed.
@Nico though I get the monetary difference between situations but a out a yr after I re-learned to drive after an accident at work left me paralyzed the truck I had was a dream truck and I worked my ass off for it but unfortunately I live in a part of the US they use salt and my frame rotted away to the point it was a dangerous thing(chevy rufused to do an oil change because they were afraid to put it on the lift) and unfortunately though it was my dream truck it was a model that was discontinued by Chevy and with my disability I didn't want something really old or questionable bjt in same token I was concerned because I was medically retired and new what my budget was & it didn't leave me many options. But like many things in life things happen for a reason good or bad I can't explain it. Make matter tiny bit worse when your paralyzed it's not very easy to test drive something but over the yrs in life I had made connections and through brothers got connected with a dealership though I thought I couldn't possibly have spec's I wanted and mentally figured out needs vs wants but when I got there and met with sales manager we had a conversation new vs old and short version he was like I just got a leased truck back early & we can make it work & it has few more options above your minimum. I shit you not I was being offered a 2 yr old top of the line GM pickup in the color i wanted the most. Not sure how they did it but I had a new dream truck I didn't think I would ever be able to own(in US special programs for military vets/public safety as well as disabled) overtime made mods I wanted.   About 6 months after I did a mod I was getting weird issues with it all electrical some similar to yours(my last truck wasn't this high tech) the scariest one turning at low speeds truck 100% lost power and with electric steering ya that means I can't even steer the wheel and I wasn't the only one but like many others the dealerships were no help and not a dig but I am pretty mechanical and despite my disability still do alot of maintenance on my own. One day I get a call out of the blue from someone at the dealership where I bought the truck advising me of a service bulletin that he wasn't supposed to share but it could be the fix. Now mind you legit have changed batteries, alternators checked wires, ground straps, fuses but what I didn't know was there was a hidden ground that went from the negative battery cable one lead to frame one to the block per the bulletin 2 fixes were needed swap out the negative cable and there were also 2 ground under the dash near A pillar by corner speakers( or tweeters) that with vibration from vehicle and speaker can come loose so I called my local dealer they one refused to do the work and lied and said no such bulletin was out. So with some help in a brothers garage over a weekend we did the repairs. Almost like you being away from home being paralyzed getting a rental isn't easy so kind of screwed if something breaks. After fixes were made knock on wood I haven't had a single issue since.   Though some of the tech is neat but I had a expensive truck and 2 wires and 2 bolts made it an expensive lawn ornament. Hang in there hopefully for you it's something similar which from your original video made me wonder, I know you mentioned they checked wiring do you know if they checked all the grounds and connectors. Again I get the cost difference but when you work your ars off for something and it breaks to a point no one has answers it's stressful also I know it doesn't matter if it's a 500k car or a 80k truck some  manufacturers can suck balls and leave you high n dry.   Though it might not help fix the car I know with me after a few pints, few doubles of Yellow or Green Spot Whiskey and few cigars I felt little better again it might not fix the situation but just try it and who knows what tomorrow will bring hopefully it's a fix Cheers
Hope your mother is doing okay Nico mate you have been an inspiration to me and a big help through my battles with my gut health and mental health so know we’re all here for you, will pop up from Dublin once doing better and would love to have a coffee and a chat ❤ be safe and keep inspiring ❤️
Nico the problem is the immobilizer. I think the dealership took the power from a wrong power lead. This would drain the battery and causes issues when battery is low. They probably took power from some sensitive ECU powered wire. I have seen radios incorrectly wired drain battery in bmw and they powered off something special and caused havock. The best way to isolate is disconnect the tracker and immobilizer. After that make sure battery fully charged then drive around.
You didn't mention in the video, but did they check every wire, every fuse, and every connection?
The sound of that 812 GTS is insane. Really doesn't get better than that imo
love the videos but you do repeat yourself a fair bit
Crazy how much better looking the coupe is.
Battery died and errors came - battery was replaced and all was good, but now back to voltage issues. Simple conclusion would be to check the alternator - if it doesn't output enough power then it's a simple (but expensive) fix
Nico, have a auto electrician ride with you with a multi meter on the alternator, I think your issue could be as simple as a faulty relay, if the relay has an intermittent fault it could be draining the battery to give you errors, if I’m right you owe me a service on my Patek Philippe 🤣👍😊
Could be an alternator, if the alt is bad then it messes up the battery if not diagnosed early enough. You can swop the battery but if it doesnt charge properly it going to continue to cause issues. Had the same issue on my Jaguar xfs
Hope you get it sorted !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
New battery cause that's probably cooked too and replace the alternator. Electrical issues are the worst to track down and solve...
You still need to pay them Nico, that was a lot of people expense on their part!
HOW IS YOUR MUM DOING!??   .
Good news ! Don't forget you still have 1/2 a cop car in Orange County :p
Don't buy ferrari or Italian car seems when you buy a Italian car you modify it you get a phone call cause you done something to it get Japanese vehicle you won't have them problems 😂
I get it void the warranty because it’s modified … butttt that means voided that they cover the cost not that they can’t problem solve and sort the issue and bill the customer at the end… that’s shocking behaviour on Ferrari to just ignore the issue and pass him on
Cracking video Nico, most important, I hope your Mum is doing ok. A car is a car, your Mum is the most important. Love to Ireland.
Seems like same issue DDE had in the Lambo. Something with the transmission
You earned it, you should have it, but not this one. This is not next generation car.... Sometimes the car is wrong from the start and you should get rid of it and buy 458. Better, cheaper, cooler.
Every wire, every connection, every plug.....Nico needs to be rebooted.
What a humble guy love to see it. Love the videos nico
Lucky boy nico.the gods were on yer side this time
wait you still have issues? did they check alternator? i add a similar problem at the end was the alternator fault (if battery 100% charge will run ok, but when alternator fails battery doenst recharge and you get eletrical faults like crazy and the car will shut off) you should resolve that because is dangerous you can get in a crash if your car shuts off, my died in a roundabout lost hidraulic turning assist imagine pull off in safety i got luck...
Great example of how crappy Ferrari customer service is, if you can even call it that.  Not even a dealer could figure out it was a stupid battery
I know in BMW you need to reprogram the ecu to tell it that a new battery has gone in otherwise the alternator will overcharge or worse.   Maybe worth checking they did that and returning to stock exhaust for now
Ah man. IT WAS A SIMPLE AS A BATTERY CHANGE!!! Why didn’t you think of that😭
Hi Nico, this is neither a positive or negative comment, it just a bit of advice from a fellow Northern Irelander and garage owner. Basically put the car back on the stock exhaust system and land it back to charly boy as not fit for purpose. You have all the video evidence to back up your claim. So far you only have bad memories of it so no big loss. The car will continue to torture all the time you will own it. Honestly its more than a battery, could be alternator, issue with charging circuit or a parasitic battery drain from one of the many ecus or a wiring loom. Ferrari techs are lost on it and obviously shifted the blame to the immobiliser company.  Whatever you do i hope it works out and your mum is in good health again. All the best Brian
Nico would get TURNED OUT in PRISON
Every wire?
How is it that Ferrari in Monaco didn't test the battery in first place? - That's always the first action any tech is making when it comes to electronic issue! I'd rather search for the reason why the battery died and consider changing or upgrading the alternator for a bigger one.
@ratarossa has a decent ferrari 348 project you should get involved with Nico
Its all down to a shite design by ferrari putting a battery next to a dirty great V12 engine and frying the battery it should be in the boot or insulated from the engine !!!
All the cigarette ashes on your side window trim in the Ferrari 😅 not good Nico bad for your health
Should have bought German
Just to clarify ..if you bought the car on finance , then the finance company own the car  ..or until you pay it off. All the same ..well done for getting there (eventually ;)
and thats y u buy a porsche
NICO! Your big black pony in the hands of misha(boosted boris) with you ridin’ shotgun around green hell ;) make it happen.
Nico, rook je nou in je Ferrari?
Nico, return it to stock and see if it fixes the issue, maybe the mods dont agree with the fuelling ecu etc
Awesome content on your mk2 channel Nico. Love all your content mate. Hope your mum made a full recovery and glad you got your car back.
I wonder if you need to spend more than £1M on Ferrari's before they cease telling customers to go f
ferrari, the worst big car company on the planet.
Get the charging side looked at. The voltage from alternator to battery, the pull on battery with ignition on and off, then go from there.
Hold on, what did they check again?..😂
Alternator issue?
Car means nothing . Family means everything. Hope your Mother is on the road to recovery
Hope your Mum is doing well now xx
Can't believe the battery wasn't the 1st thing that was checked! Kwik fit would've came up with that fix in an hour.
Stay safe.
I feel so sorry for you. Hindsight is everything. People should only modify cars that are out of warranty. Because car companies will use the excuse.
I’m wondering if you still have the original issue but jump starting the battery cooked it and sent the car mad . New battery , back to square one . Should have bought a red one
❤his 🎉
I would never buy a Ferrari. Great cars but the company itself is the drizzling shits.
So 3000 miles away you would technically be in another country but here in the US 3000 miles away from my house in Ohio would be California.
I appreciate you not wanting to stick the boot into Ferrari but their customer service when you needed them was appalling and they should be ashamed - massive PR fuck up by them - and surprise surprise it was one of their products was at fault 🙄
Hope your mom is doing well.
Constantin is such a legend!
If you had bought a red one ……..
Sounds like the Ferrari is a lemon, every once in a while some cars irrespective of price just are full of problems and can’t be fixed, you lose faith and trust in it. Hope your family and loved ones are well now. 🤙🏻
Ferrari Sh*t on you big time.. Voiding your warranty for putting the car to the way it should have been. And it turns out that they cant even get a battery right.
Good for you fella. :)
Also this is why I don’t own any Ferrari 😂😂😂
Too many problems for 400k
I'd put it back to stock and give it a couple of weeks. You'll know then if it's the mods or not
Hey brother please have a check on the alternator, i believe that the module that regulates the voltage might be going bad inside the alternator, there fore it charges perfectly sometimes and other times it drops the voltage a slightly bit and makes the computer freak out. I hope this helps bro 🙏🙏
What a shit company. You pay gargantuan amounts of money for a car that doesn't work and you aren't allowed to fix yourself.
Ferrari makes the best looking terrible cars 😂
I was wondering..have you had someone check the wires ,plugs n fuses...lols..love ur channel..peace
Such a genuine lad
I was just about to put the Novitech exhaust on my 812 GTS.   This video has forced me to pause my decision.   The dealer said, exhausts were OK.   But apparently Ferrari has a different idea.   Did you do any mods other than the exhaust system?
It must really dishearten you Nico. I really feel for you brother. Keep your chin up I'm sure it will get fixed. Sounds like the voltage regulator to me which will give you the problems you have had. We cant wait for your next video brother.
That’s a problem car and probably always will be ,sometimes it happens, you didn’t say what was wrong with the battery , is the charging system working
Check all the grounds, remove them and make sure there is clean contact. Bench test the alternator at different speeds.
Watching your mini ferrari series is what made me start watching every watch video on your main channel! The issue with Ferrari is they couldnt be bothered to look at it, its a good job Novitec looked into it for you
Kick it out
Put it back to stock you say….the warranty is FOREVER voided by Ferrari. Sorry, but you’re not ready to own a Ferrari. At least grow up stop whining about problems that you’ve caused.
Bro that "I love cars" at 15:06 reminded me so much of the "I like turtles" kid lmaoooooo
I struggled with xmas lights on my dash (2020 Panamera gts). 3 services includding dealer couldn't resolve the problem. And then..it was all about bloody battery...
What mods did you do to your car
I can see your wonderful 'experience' with Ferrari is continuing) ... get used to it my friend Lol
13 on trending well done mate 🎉
But it is still broken the steering wheel is on the wrong side
Damn. I love the fact that the solution to this problem could have been solved by calling his dad. All of the nerding out, and all I can think of is my dad saying “did you change the battery?” That being said, I bet the alternator is bad too.
Why wasn’t it installed by novitec in the first place?
If you were keeping it forever and a day,  just return it to stock, until the Ferrari’s warranty expires then slap on all the modifications you desire.  I personally think it the ECU. Just  get Matt Armstrong to fix it.  Ps Ferrari is my favourite,  most unreliable super car brand ever.
I’d check the alternator next. Intermittent problems with it maybe.🤷🏻‍♂️
I loved seeing you on dde! I am stoked you have your own channel now! Congratulations 🎉 on the ferrari!!!
F%ck the car...... Hows ya mom? i hope she's ok ?
Why you always shouting bro
That Ferrari is absolutely SICK! The spec and colors in it 😭 I would give a finger to own that thing 😂😂
good luck nico.
Like other commenters, surely the alternator is faulty. If the regulator has broken down internally it could be sending too much voltage into the battery and therefore slowly frying it, on the other hand it might not be charging enough and draining the battery too much.
Brabus and Novitec legendssss
I would look into the alternator, if its not working it will kill the battery. Kinda sus that the battery (new) just died. To me it looks like a faulty alternator.
if Ferrari don't fix this for you under warranty and use mods as an excuse they will lose any respect they might have had, best way to show them is don't give them your money in the future.
check all the ground cables(wires). one may be loose, from experience - suffered 6 months and wasted money on diagnostics.
Sorry. Gave up watching half way through; talk about cutting a short story long! Pure waffle and no content. Perhaps the Bolivian marching powder was still in his system, but this is utter crap compared to his excellent watch content. Worlds apart in every way.  Still, he’s got a nice shiny car on finance with no warranty. Fingers crossed……
Sounds like alternator problems 🤔
Ferrari is Hublot!
It took two weeks to figure out it was the battery 😂😂😂
I wonder if anyone actually did a PROPER diagnostic test on the battery? 🤔
That behavior is like what happened to DDE SVJ in Gumball rally. Think about it Nico 🤔 have them check the idle sensor it might need reviewing.
Hope the best for you
We do love a Nico 😊
Watch Emilia Hartford video on what the fix on hers, it looks like the similar issues.
hope you get your car sorted out
NICO GET RID ITS CURSED
Stop smoking in the car, the fag ash collects on the door pillar when it blows back.
Man, this is the reason I have never bought a Ferrari. You hear horror stories like this and it shits you up.
This is exactly why I will never ever buy a Ferrari.  Instead I’ve bought 3 McLarens instead.  Say what you will about the gremlins that McLarens have, but they have stood by me as a customer many times.  McLarens customer service has been great.  When I was looking to possibly buy a Ferrari 15 years ago, I drove into the dealer with an NSX.  They laughed and  said to me… looks like you’re finally gonna buy a real car.  That when I walked out laughing, and said, certainly not a Ferrari.  Never went back.
Every wire, every fuse x5
17:26 A 911 dakar lurking in the background.
From my experience when you get the all the faults at the same time it's the alternator overcharging. I have seen it 2x on regular peasant cars.
Check your grounds!!!!
Interesting that they havent changed the battery first. Same thing applies to PC's if you have weird blue screens, shut downs or whatever first change the power supply unit if the problem persists look further.
Dear, thank you so much for uploading this type of content. I also own a Ferrari 812 GTS and I'm about to install a complete exhaust system, so we'll see what happens. 🤞🏽🤌🏽
Return the car and say f''k you.
He’ll never drive this car without worrying. What a bummer 🤕
Stay positive. Ignore negative people. Most people enjoy your content and I enjoy the Tudor Harrods you got for me. Amazing. Your a good guy. Thank you
Nico, you had an alternator issue and the battery died.  All those faults came back when you jumped the car to start it back.  I would double check the ground and positive terminal after replacing the alternator and battery.  My advice check the starter motor also for damaged wires.
That's gotta be the alternator, surely. Had an ecu earth flag up similar symptoms too once. Wish you all the best dude
Thats one way to drag a video out by repeating eventhing several times.....
itsnt the start stop system?
This car is a lemon. Get rid of it. Not fixable
The fact Ferrari didn't try a new battery as the first thing is criminal!
Sorry to hear about your mom hope she is ok and getting better.  Nico Roman was looking into de-icing a watch and was told around 10-20G to do it, so yes it can be done, do I like "Blinged out" watches hell no, but there are those who do so there's a market for them, Ferrari's are kinda of known to have battery/electrical problems, I would assume Novitec would have checked your alternator, so who knows good luck mate
enjoy your vlogs pls do more nic
Best wishes for your Mom. Car and Watches are just "things" you can buy and sell...
IJmuiden the harbour of Amsterdam? No. Not the whole country is Amsterdam.
Ferrari cars Ducati bikes Made in Italy Alway in the shop for repair Fact
I have an F12, and mine threw random error messages until I added second ground from the engine to the battery. Stock engine ground isn't adequate.
Call me ignorant. But, you can actually finance a Ferrari?
First things first, is mom okay?  Secondly, return it to 100% stock, retain your Ferrari warranty so you don't have to pay for the repairs. Give it back to Ferrari and tell them you don't want the car back until its fixed.  Once its fixed go ahead and put the Novitec upgrades back on.
Fuck the car, i hope your mom is well and stays well.
Spotted the car in Belfast a few days ago was so stoked to see you got it home!
Swap out the alternator!
I an so sorry for the problems you have with your splendid car! I just bought a new watch yesterday. A green Sherwood. Damn is that a good looking Watch.
When are you going to put down the horse & buy bull?
That's the way ferrari gets out of doing repairs at no cost to them.  Just blame the customer even when its their fault. Typical ferrari
not bad for selling consigned watches
Think it’s time to return to stock and send the car back to Ferrari . Going to save a load of time and headaches . Get the problem fixed then pop your bits back on
Glad it all worked out. Shows how useless Ferrari are, that they can’t diagnose a flat battery.   With regard to returning it to stock, would be interesting to know if Ferrari reinstate the warranty?   Ditch the Ferrari and get a vintage Porsche. Ferrari seem like a bunch of c**ts.
Rookie mistake… If you buy preowned then modify, if you buy new just keep it stock until warranty expires…
At the end of this video, you mentioned the errors are starting again.  DID YOU CHANGE THR BATTERY???????? or did you expect NOVITEC to honour that for free at €500 a pop!!!  You never mentioned it was changed and if it was, was it a genuine Ferrari battery? and not a super counterfeit from china.   Hope your parents are going to be ok.  Moral of the story:Don’t take anything for granted.    Good luck
9:12 😂😂😂 if you think it was just a battery then you are a gullible idiot. No way it was just a battery....
is it me or is this chap walking in circles just so damn annoying
6:51 dude, finance is not a good option, especially if you are modifying. Just buy outright
Hope yir ma`s well.
Remove the anti-theft device you had fitted, the test vehicle wthout if fitted not just unplugged, they can be Problematic leading to voltage drain, which you have had, as well as playing havoc with the CAN bus electronic control units (ECUs) which will throw up loads of code issues.
wow 3700 per month is more than my monthly bills.
What a legend Constantine from Brabus is 🤩
What happened to your added immobilizer????
Alternator regulator possibly over charging intermittently  which then cooks the battery. Get it on live data and open her up on the M2 to see how high above 14v it goes
Next step replace the alternator.
I had a similar problem a few years back. Was the alternator
Ferrari OEM batteries are terrible. In fact my dealer in Chicago area changes out the OEM batteries before they deliver a new car. They just avoid the hassle and eat the price of putting a decent battery in the cars and keep the customers happy vs taking the risk of those terrible batteries.
Was the warranty affected by the aftermarket exhaust?
Seems you might have a lemon law car unfortunately
My heart goes out to you mate. I treat my car like one of my children so I understand your upset when they go wrong. Like you, I work hard for the things I own so I don’t need anyone’s justification for what I do with my cash. I really hope you get it sorted so that you can enjoy and love it as you did when you first got it. All the best. Mark.
U have been surrounded by great people to help you because u urself r a legend ✊
I would get the alternator checked it may not be charging the battery correctly which can cause the error codes. Really glad to see your success i hope and pray you continue to prosper 🙏  i wish your mum a speedy recovery
It's weird that on all the insane advanced "analyzing" software that exist now it can't identify something as simple as a battery?? Reminds me of having trouble a few years ago with a Land Rover Defender, first thing I replaced was the battery, then I replaced the diesel pump in the tank, googling it and concluded that it was probably the ECU, then it was towed to the dealer that worked a full three days to diagnose it without any result, even if I TOLD them that this was my conclusion, that they did not believe as they had "plugged in the analyzer" and it did not detect that the ECU was at fault... This is why I doubt AI as I think it will get loads of things wrong.
Why tf is there a tesla parked outside novitec
That Brabus guy is like a real-world Batman lol. We need more people like that
Ain't gonna lie, i was dreaming about supercars but did not expect that  most of the brands are very bad in terms of reliability. Conclusion: i am gonna buy twice the same exemplar to make sur one is always working. 🤓🫡
To be fair this is what you get for putting aftermarket diamonds on your watch….. oops wrong channel
Thus channel is exactly what we needed👍
You joke about Tesla, however, you would've been in S*it street if Novitech and Brabus hadn't come to your aid Nico so a BIG shoutout to them. As for Ferrari, this reinforces my view that I'll never buy a car from them. I get Ferrari wants to ensure third-party equipment doesn't compromise their product (however they are just as unreliable stock). But why don't they create partnerships with those chosen third parties and qualify certain product that is compatible, giving choice to the customer? After all, don't we all want to personalise our cars! But Ferrari first shout warranty VOID!!! It's is definitely a monopoly. Ferrari maybe Nico will stay true to you, but I'm one who won't
Alternator ???
First things first , hope your mums recovered. You only get one and secondly glad your cars sorted 👍🏼
100% alternator is fucked. Its not keeping stable voltage
Replacing the battery would have been the first thing i would have done. Just remove all the crap that Ferrari did not put in that car. GPS , Alarm, Exhaust, Tectronic, and whatever more crap they put in. Then you will see if it was the car or the aftermarket stuff. I bet it was something aftermarket
There's not that many people I think deserve success. But you my friend are definitely one it's good to see good people doing well 🤑
Love this content mate, you have some fantastic friends and also well done novitech you guys absolutely rock!
Fingers crossed for a solution on this Nico & Im totally horrified by Ferrari just washing their hands of a problem on a car they manufactured & its even more shi*e when its now proven it was nothing to do with Novitec! & huge thanks to your friends at Brabus!! All the best to your Mum & Family!!! 👍
Have them swap the alternator. Obviously the car kills batteries over time and theres really only one part that can do that.
That's why old pre computer Ferrari's cost and arm and a leg.
I would put the car back to as it came out of the factory just to see if the car throws faults , it might give you some answers
Rolls-Royce is quality
Why did no one check the basics of a car the battery? fuse, levels in the engine, and no one bothered to check the battery, that's bad.
If I buy a Patek, I expect it to function 100% of the time, finish without flaw.  For a car that costs 300k+ to throw errors especially when it’s a few months old. That’s equivalent to a getting a brand new Patek but not able to wind it.. just shocking…
What did they check?….
If the 812 wasn’t so new, with a Ferrari and electrical problems the first thing you do is replace the battery.  I guess no one thought the battery would be bad on a couple of month old battery.  One thing about modern Ferrari batteries, if you let them go flat, they may not recover.  Make sure you keep it on the included battery tender when not in use, even if a couple of days.  Unlike Porsche, Ferrari don’t go to sleep and always have vampire drain.
£60 eurocarpart battery £400 Ferrari sticker over the top of it…….. but £3700 finance on the car?
Novitech fucked you up Nico.
Hope your Mum is doing well thats more important than the car. However it broke my heart when your warning signs came back on. I think its still electrical coz the engine is working fine. Hope you find out whats wrong and its fixed mate. Good luck
Nico, you didn't need a THIRD channel to upload this video. Your second channel was good enough.
Alternator / voltage regulator issue for sure based on how fast the issues are coming back. I'm not sure what an 812 alternator costs but after all the grief it's caused, surely just throw one at it and give it a go.
Sell it and buy a Hyundai solaris
So funny seeing a Tesla at Novitec in the background lol. Try put an exhaust on that
I'm in the market for gts but ferrari company comments are putting me off, and I thought JLR were bad ! They both really DONT CARE ! I've got personal experience (BAD) with both.
Don´t stop doing what makes you happy, Nico you are the best!!!!
Bro I wish for that problems.
No one cares no one
ferrari is lucky that people still buying their cars because their behaviour is dispicable! come on dont protect ferrari after the way they behaved while it wasnt your fault because stupid battery.
I'm going to buy a Toyota
20 minutes of dribble sorry
get a lambo
I think alternator should be checked next, possibly intermittent.
I find it hilarious that Ferrari spits in your face, and you still claim to love and adore them. All that money spent and they just throw their hands up in the air and say "not our problem" for something basic like a battery/alternator issue?  For a company that supposedly cares about craftsmanship and quality, they sure are quick to blame anyone else for a problem that's obviously theirs.   In this day and age, I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to sue you just for posting a video about the problems you are having.
Absolute legend Brabus!!! He’s a real one for that💪. And  Ferrari just disappointing 🤦‍♂️. They should have done Nico right and got the free advertisement 🫡
I hope things get sorted for you 🙂🇮🇪🍀💚
Only $4,000 a month for 30 years…
Your alternator may be ducked mate, that could kill batteries all day till sunday and give you a bunch of spontaneous faults, check it as soon as you get home Good luck Nico, let her have it!!!!😂
Check your solenoid and alternator. Surely there is an issue with the alternating current that causes the ecu to malfunction. If not then it’s as simple as a earth leakage. Possibly your main one on the Engine.
Firstly, I hope your folks are well. Family comes before everything. Secondly, I’m glad the car is fixed, even though Ferrari wiped their hands of it. Keep entertaining us pal on your crazy journey.
Love your watch videos so I’m excited to see what you will do with the car side of YouTube
I remember when the Mercedes had issues in their W220 and W221 S-Class when it was moist or wet outside. The wiring harness under the seats got wet somehow and had a lot of people stranded with errors on the side of the road. It got a huge backlash on reliability. I`m writing this as I notice the weather conditions you were driving were just like that - wet and moist.
You have to treat modern batteries as consumable items. They give really weird faults long before they show traditional battery faults. My KTM bike gives some very weird faults when the battery is tired.
So I couldn't give a flying fuck about watches sorry. However I first saw you on DDE and after watching this you get my sub mate for been an A1 bloke.
Love your new Ferrari, but what a pile of crap for such a beautifully car, I would put it back to stock, then dump it on Ferrari`s door and make them replace it with a new one, as its not fit for purpose. I would have no confidence in the car after all the faults on it.
How’s your mum?
Sounds like alternator problems
What did Biggie Say ? More money , More Problems …
For a relaxed ownership of a supercar buy a porsche turbo s.
New Ferrari's come with 7 years of warranty and service.  What did many of us fans told you, Nico?  Don't modify your car, just like you shouldn't modify your watches.  Look what happened?  you're lucky Novetic helped and you could give them a plug.  If you own a car that's past its warranty, then you can do whatever you like to it.
Novitec is the goat, If u was a good mechanic u would not buy a Ferrari 😉
Nico, this shit is far more complicated than a stupid watch so you DEFINILTY dont want to touch it. Hope you mom is well
I think that u should check the alternator... Maybe the alternator is not filling the battery as it should
Hello Nico! Your Mom lives here in Finland? Do you speak any finnish?
I'm unclear on what Novitech did? What did they check?
You poor man. All those troubles. But you stuck at it. I wish you and your car well
15:06 ' I'm just me, nico Leonard and I love cars'  🙌🏻
Seems to me they’ve fixed the problem but not the cause of the problem! So naturally the same problem will cause the battery to fail again.I personally think you may have a alternator problem possibly over charging the battery causing the cells to fail! 🤷🏽‍♂️
buy A Lamborghini 😂
Great to see the car back working, and a great advert for Novitec and their work. As Chris Slix said...Battery...so many modern cars are extremely picky about having a battery in perfect condition... they don't,  for all the tech, seem to have battery low indicators, to at least let you know while the dashboard looks like a Christmas tree
i guess your fans liked this (i followed you via MA)... but  this was poorly edited and rambling...
Just in case you make it in life, don't buy a Ferrari, get a Lamborghini or Porsche instead. Both brands will treat you better.
next time buy a porshe XD
just get rid of that shit and buy a BMW
People slating Ferrari are delusional, if you modify a car with non OEM parts it’s entirely reasonable to void the warranty.
Just a thought, a lot of people are pointing towards the alternator, but it may be as simple as a very poor main earth on the body shell from the battery. I had this problem some years ago with a Land Rover Discovery which was an intermittent problem which resulted in the electrics trying to find alternative earthing points.
Casually wearing the smartest hush money watch in the world. Stay classy, Nico
Im happy that the car is sorted and i hope your mother is doing okay! I got into watches because of your videos, I built up a rather nice collection, had to sell them when my son was born but hopefully i can rebuild it back over time!
So Happy for Irish James Corden.👍
Did they check every wire , every fuse and every connection ? i would check to make sure. Glad you're back on the road and happy .
To be fair... Novitech would be the 1st place I took the car considering it was there mod that fucked it!
Replace the alternator, sounds like it's not giving enough juice to the battery when the cars on tic over, I bet if you drive the car for another few 100 miles the overall level of charge in the battery will deplete and you'll get an early Christmas on your dash same as before. I also keep a blue tooth odb2 reader in the car so I can use my phone to read and reset codes if I'm in a situation when I really need the car to drive, worth considering, assuming Ferrari use odb2.
sorry to hear about your mum i hope shes well now mate, problem with cars one problem leads to a next XD, youll get it sorted now mate love watching the vids
Incredible service from Novitec - what a class act. Saving my pennies to become a customer ONE DAY haha
I wonder if they checked every wire, every connection and every fuse...
Just get the alternator replaced. They can read correctly at idle, or through the rev range but still be broken giving out intermittent wrong voltages. Happens a lot with many cars.
Hmmm - Fiats....
I wish you all the best with this car but next time you buy a sports car take a Porsche 👍 Thanks for the video
It's either a loose earth or the alternator is faulty❤
This is  probably already tried, but like you said it s a rocketship in sensors and other electronic equipment, could it be possible that one or more sensors are broken.. some will be connected with each other, and if one fails then automatically the other would give a fail to.. like i said ,this is probably already been tested but i know from my car ( not a supercar just a normal Mercedes C Class from 2000) , that even in the early 2000 there was a sh*itload on electronic in the car , and i had one sensor that f*cked op my whole car. disconnected the wire when we found the problem, after that never had any problems and even performs better without it😂   Sadly i didnt see you driving Thru the Netherlands, in my truck i am very often around Amsterdam, but that said, the chance is 1 to what 10million?  😂we Catch each other on the road.. wish you the best  and hope to see the Ferrari working well soon,   als best wishes to you and your family and especially your Parents,   much greetings from the Netherlands
if you need any assistance in Germany, I am happy to support you
100% alternator needs to be replaced
Get down to Supercar Bruce at GVE he will sort it, check your alternator that could be the reason
you monkey clean your phone! nice car tho, its really good! but that fatfinger phoned is crazy! can i get a cheap rolex? youre the best
Get a turbo S 😂
Oh man I thought they went through every wire, every connection and every fuse 🥲!! So sad to hear it nico!!
Johnny enjoying vape 🎉😅
I think now that you've linked up with Matt and Chris Slix you should get rebuilt car's this looks like a financial drainpit considering the warranty is void, Ferrari will rule the car out in their system no matter which dealership you take or whether you return in to stock...
Was Ferrari wrong, though?
Been waiting on this video for weeks 😂 CEO of Brabus to the rescue 🙌
I can imagine the stress of driving back home, you really don’t need it, but at least you made it and hopefully Jack will put things right. At least you are on home turf but I can really understand your frustration. A lifetime ambition and at the moment it’s one big dump. A fabulous car and I hope you get the enjoyment back from when you first drove it out of the showroom. Good luck.
Some good look pal. Hope your Mam is getting better.
I wouldn’t think twice about selling the car and or reverting to stock components after spending that much money and live with problems instead of enjoying the car, unless its some sort of change!
Might be worth a try to bring the car back to stock and see if it behaves itself? When getting my jeep serviced, we put in 2 different aftermarket air filters and each time the jeep went into limp mode. So I got a genuine Mercedes air filter and it’s worked perfect ever since!  No rhyme or reason as to why the Bosch ones didn’t work, and maybe your Ferrari is kinda doing the same thing??   Great content mate, glad your mum is keeping better!
ferrari dealer at monaco...imo they are incopetent, they sould know at least try to put new battery unless batteries coded to car itself something stupid :D
Me: I am looking for a certain psychological name  ChatGPT: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Could you please provide more details or context about the psychological name you're looking for? The more information you provide, the better I can assist you.   Me: You are still a supporter/fan of a certain thing even if that thing disappoints you constantly and breaks promises  ChatGPT: The psychological phenomenon you're describing is often referred to as "cognitive dissonance" or "loyalty paradox." Cognitive dissonance occurs when there is a contradiction between beliefs or attitudes, leading to discomfort. In the context you mentioned, it could involve being a supporter or fan of something or someone despite constant disappointment. People may experience cognitive dissonance when their beliefs about the thing or person clash with the disappointing reality.  The loyalty paradox is another concept related to this. It highlights the tendency of individuals to remain loyal to a person, brand, or idea even when faced with disappointment. Loyalty often involves a strong emotional connection, and individuals may be reluctant to let go due to emotional investment, past positive experiences, or a desire to maintain a consistent self-image.  In summary, cognitive dissonance and the loyalty paradox help explain why someone might continue to support or be a fan of something or someone despite repeated disappointments.    @Niko 😘
Been waiting for this for weeks , glad it's fixed...ish novitec fair play 👌
Ferrari don't deserve your praise, Novitec did their job for them. How many Teslas in the novitech carpark ?
the 348 is not a horrible drive car why youtubers exaggerate like that
The hublot of the automotive world
I know exactly what will solve your 812 problem!!! You need to bring it to New Orleans, Louisiana, and hand the keys over to me, then BAM problem SOLVED!!
Put it back to stock reset all the codes and try it again, Could just be a sensor issue with the mods you've done.
Nico I think you are being too kind to Ferrari. You changed the exhaust. Big deal. The issues with this car are way beyond just an exhaust change. Ferrari need to show the dedication and customer service that Novitec showed you. What's it going to cost them apart from a great piece of PR. Shame on you Ferrari, help this guy out!
Omg so lucky it was just a battery and nothing more serious
🧇😂
Im sorry to hear about your mother.  Its a real bummer about the 812 as well and hope its fixed soon.  When i was younger i had a new mustang gt like this.  Electrical issue and was always something even tho it was such a cool car.  Its no million dollar car like yours but it was special to me and made it heartbreaking to own, always wondering if id get stranded.  I finally just said fuk it and traded it in and get a new one and the next one was built so good i loved it and put 100k miles on it and traded it in when bought a truck.  Sometimes its not worth the headaches.
🙏🏽 italiaan electronics always a  little pray to have them
Couldn't happen to a nicer person!
whts the alt look like
Your filming makes me seasick!!
You ruined the car hahaha 😂 black aftermarket hublo with 4 wheels
☑️
Trivia question how many times did Niko say "every wire, every connector and every plug"
i got a £50 loan ill buy it
sounds like a lemon car my friend...
Hope your mother is doing better Nico!
What did they check again?
I’m no mechanic at all, but to me, the new issues sound alternator related. Maybe give that a try? 🤔
Out of all brands that's supercar orientated i would choose Ferrari as the best of the best because they have a gigantic array of cars throughout the years way more cars then Lamborghini or any other manufacturer that only focuses on high end cars , they have GT's , they have supercars , no sportscars , they now have SUV's they hare front engined cars rear engined cars they have awd cars and rwd cars they have 2 seater to 4 seater to 5 seater cars they literally have absolutely everything if i had to drive 1 brands cars for the rest of my life it would be Ferrari
Damn Nico so many problems on the Ferrari I don’t know man I don’t know
My man bought a custom made lemon. Should have gotten it in yellow.
Classic big company like that, denial that it’s their fault and that you changed something so it must be that, only to find out that their own GENUINE battery was at fault. 🤣 Good video mate. Been waiting for it. 👊🏼
If it was the Ferrari Battery it was Ferraris fault.
Broken record. Totally losing it!
word of advice from a ex ferrari employee, trade it in and get a lambo or a porsche.  ferrari these days is just living off past glory, pretty much all recent models have nothing but problems especially electric.
Nico.  Sorry to hear about all the drama mate and even more sorry to hear about your dear mum….. family always 1st.  Anyways, this is a long shot and I don’t know if it’s been mentioned before.  I had a similar situation a while back with my Aussie Ford FPV V8.  I had replaced the wheels and suspension and shortly after I had TC and ESC and some voltage fault codes come up intermittently.  Like you, I was busted up over it and it made me jittery every time I drive the damn thing.   I sorted it after many months of $$$$$ spent at various workshops and it ended up. Ring a pinched and broken ABS sensor on the rear right wheel.  This made the car think it was either spinning or losing traction or not getting the correct signal from the sensor which was throwing codes like a Christmas light and even made the car go into limp mode.  I would clear the codes and then after a couple of KLM…. Hey presto … same cr@p.  So how about you check the driveline sensors in case something went wrong during your wheel and suspension change.  Also make sure your new wheels have an acceptable rolling diameter parameter to the original wheels as this can also set off error codes like crazy.    Good luck with it mate, love your channel and health and happiness to you and your family.   Regards from Australia !!!!
Good luck guy hope for the best ❤
Sounds like you got a bad alternator
I think the alternator isn't charging the battery right so when it got swapped out it worked but after some time it didnt because the battery didnt charge
Love your honesty... Great video... 7:27
85 notes for a hoodie,yer taking the cunt pal!!
I'm sorry, but this car will be a big pile of trash when your son is all grown up... cars don't last as they did (especially the electronic components)
The flicked ash residue on the door pillar @19:17 .. lol who smokes in a 812 GTS lol
So threr ferrari dealers didnt know it was the battery .problem is a dead battery is normally a consiquence not the main issue .
Ferrari is shite   Hublot > Ferrari
About time to drop the first video 🎉
Thats why I World never buy an Italien car, them Look great and if they work they are amazing but 99% of times they don't.
The fact that it was just the damn battery is the most Ferrari thing I've heard all day.  I hope your mother is OK, and if you have to drive a Ferrari 2000kms, that's probably the best one.
Sounds like this is true fashion for Ferrari service. Seen a few youtube videos talking about this.
Ferrari need to go through the charging system etc and find the issue. If its related to any mods and they can show that then its reasonable they don't cover it under warranty. If its something like alternator etc and not related to mods they need to cover it. Its pretty shit to just say warranty is gone without knowing what is wrong with car. Hopefully your dealer in Ireland will get you sorted out its always best to have your car back with the selling dealer. Really hope you come right its a lot of money to be giving this stress should be just giving you pleasure .
5:00 like a French chef man
Nico, i love the content, please keep it coming, a big shout out from 🇿🇦SouthAfrica 🙌  All the best for your Mum
Sorry about your Mum and hope she is ok mate... keep going and doing what you do best- making others smile.. thanks Wayne
Id have the alternator tested
Could the battery having a parasidic drain? Which in turn could be damaging the battery? Maybe @Diagnosedan could help you
The god tier of cars, Ferrari ownership.
NICO ! Go try a Porsche GT3 RS that will blow your mind too :D
Regulator in alternator is shite
What a shame. Hope it gets sorted soon, and hope your mother is well again. Keep us posted. :)
I simply said, if a manufacturer will not let you put an exhaust on a car....... Never ever buy that brand again.
never buy a ferrari
Send that back it’s a lemon sir
You got this @Nico!
I wonder if the issue will come back with this battery after some time?
I’d be so pissed if I paid that money for that unreliable bucket of shit! Give me a Porsche GT3 any day
1. Novitec is better than Ferrari attitude wise. 2. Your mother is very important and I hope she gets well. That makes one think that a problem with a Ferrari is nothing compared to a health problem... 3. Nico is an awesome guy.
Not for nothing… a brand new super car that costs what it costs.. should not have any issues
Ferrari Brand Batteries being trash… who would’ve thought 😂
Novitec had to collect the car to prove that their product was never the problem. Ferrari who voided the warranty dropped the ball by blaming others for a battery that they issued... hope they realize that.
Sounds like the alternator issue. It can't hold the battery charge steady. 90% that's the issue.
So is your mom okay? I don't care about the car at this point.
So basically Novitec make better exhausts and have better service than Ferrari..
This is why Jay Leno said he would never own a Ferarri
Ferrari! You need to take care of your customers.
Been waiting foreverrrrr for this bro u like 2 weeks late
You may have problem with alternator … or maybe you may be need to add more ground from battery to the body of the car.
Yeah, but did they check every wire, fuse and connection before replacing the battery?
i want to hear the outcome of nicos mother, is she ok? is she gettting better? whats the outcome?
Nico hunched over sadly next to the Ferrari lol Welcome to your new hobby Nico! 😭
Recommended in my feed Nico, here DDE. Love this Nico…
Maybe check and change the alternator if it’s not working well it’s going to drain the battery. The electronics won’t get the power they need and you’ll continue having issue as well as  these error lights.
Great to see that it was at least sorted for a short while and you got it home. As for a 348... well they drive pretty well to be fair. Surprisingly good drive and cheap as Ferraris go. It's the conversion that will cost you.
First and foremost I hope your mother is making a speedy recovery and that she'll be back to 100% in no time. As for the car at this point the best bet is to bring it back to stock. Ferrari has been designing and programming more and more of their models to not accept aftermarket components and remaps. Where issues will purposely show up from their tactics.Thats just my perspective among the hundreds of others.
Sounds 🔥 nice car walrus
Sounds like more electrical gremlins. Probably a bad ground or something.
Nico is finally showing his true weakness - blinded fealty to Ferrari? I guess Nico had millions expletives to burst out at Ferrari as he usually does to watch brands. But Ferrari with definitely blacklist his ass if he had done that. Guess everyone has their weakness of choice huh?
The BATTERY 😂😭😭 imagine those mechanics after going through all that complicated shyt then at the end just trying everything, replacing that battery and it working fine😂😂
Ferrari, happy to take your money but service non-existant!
Did they check the wires tho ?
Very good Nico! Hope you can speak with other 812 owners and see if this is a common problem. As for the content, you should do a rally with some friends like Matt and drive the best roads with the best sights in your dream car!
Ill buy a G-Shock if you have a decent one??
What a story sorry for your machine of choice I will never sell my Mustang now hope somebody can sort it out
I am so glad everything worked out for you and it’s great to see you have amazing people in your corner. 🙏🇦🇺
Omg, Nico feel your frustration about the car, very disappointed have very expensive  car we all issues, and sorry about your mom, hope all the best for you
Two things you never put your money into. Ferrari and Novitech...
I’d say alternator - it must stop charging at some point and running the battery down a bit - something could be pulling to much power- hope you get someone that can actually help you brother
Never finance your toys. Love the car it’s beautiful! Finally picked up my Panda from the dealer this year.
Let's help Nico make his childhood toy car into reality by supporting this channel.
Hopefully, Ferrari sees your effuse praises of them and reinstates your warranty. The company has a bad reputation when it comes to customer service and really should make things right with someone who acts as a brand ambassador.
Yes, you can put the Stock exhaust system back on but guess what you are now in Ferrari system and anybody who bought that car from you is going to have a warranty problem with Ferrari
So happy for you Nico! Novitec is the sh*t!!!
This has been the best ad for buying cars with less tech. LOL. A battery should not cause these kinds of problems. Nice job Novitec and Brabus, not so nice job Ferrari.
I think you  should check your alternator
Considering the issue was deemed the battery and it initially “resolved” it, it seems the battery isn’t holding charge. Screams alternator issues and the battery is just dying. Like a phone plugged in with the plug turned off
that sucks Nico!!! Goodluck with the Ferrari.... Next time get a Lambo.
i love this type of videos dont worry  7:00
Less they helped you to get the car back and it sounds like it the cpu what is playing up
All the chinese wiring & electrical parts in it, not that they were ever made that well IE: 348 TS motor has to come out every 40,000kms to change the timing belt 🤣‼️
Something is up with the charging system. A new altenator needs to be installed to see if thats the issue. Then go after the ground side of the charging system and main harness tie points. It could also end up being a faulty ECU.
Give the bloody thing back. What a horror story, with a car that cost 10 fortunes.
Earth issue, even if it looks ok, i would replace the earth strap.
All the best with your mum. Good luck with the 812, my friend bought a brand new Roma last year year and had similar problems since day one. It was in and out of ferrari constantly sometimes for weeks sometimes for months, and they never fixed it. In the end he bought a new one and they took the old one back for what he paid. Hopefully yours is easier fixed.
Looking forward to the car channel!
HAPPY FOR YOU NICO!!! Enjoy the shit out of it!
You say Novitec didn’t have to pick up the car, but in reality if they didn’t - their reputation has potential huge downsides especially due to your clout and reach publicly. They basically had to try to clear their name.
Take the car to Dublin and park it in O'Connell St then just wait for the cheque to drop through the door.  Then buy a decent car, not Italian
I hope your mom gets better 💓
We need to see Nico in the next Gumball. With the DDE boys and Mr JWW you guys get super wild with them
Sorry to hear about you mum I hope she gets better. Also hope you are staying safe from the crazies in Dublin.
The G-Shocks for Novitec are on you then.
The only reason he’s not shitting on Ferrari is they’d take the car back 😂
Changing the exhaust on a performance car is often NOT a good idea.  I had a similar situation with a much cheaper performance car.  Nico kind of brought this on himself.
Love the watch series but absolutely loving this car series
How's your mom?
Proficiat met je auto. AUB niet meer zo heen en weer ijsberen met de cam. Daar wordt de kijker helemaal duizelig van. Succes verder 👍
Might be a ecu problem
I heard they went through every wire, every connection, every fuse
Having valeted many Ferraris from Testarossas to Berlinettas, one common theme was that Ferraris were in the shop more than they were driven.  Not anyone's fault, just a pain in the ass adapting racing technology to everyday use on the street.  You're doing unbelievably well, an inspiration of passion and excellence to all.  So, it's just another speed bump you'll overcome in your remarkable journey.  Much Love and Respect.  Thank You!  💪
So did Ferrari refuse to fix it under warranty? My friend had similar issues with a stock exhaust … he rejected the car and the dealer refunded him
There's only one man for that job.....Diagnose Dan !!! Keep'r lit lad 👍
Does it have a battery management system, that might be busted or the alternator. It looks like voltage issues. Typical high strung car stuff. Upgrade the alternator maybe.
Well done Nico. I feel your relief. Pleased it was just the battery. What a bonus!
Great Customer service
Well, Ferrari have an incredible engine, superior. The only problem  that they have is they are crap. Bad build and terrible finishing. Not of a high standard.
Quite a journey, literally!  Maybe worth buying a code reader to see what shows up, maybe ask mat to ask Carly ?
Should not have discounted what the Tow Truck Driver told you and replaced the battery as he suggested? What could he possibly know? only sees broken down Italian cars daily, life lessons, thanks for sharing the adventure and the lesson
Alternator charging system / ground strap.  battery not charging, voltage drops, errors come out to play
also could be the alternator as if it is faulty it would mean that there is no charge going to the battery when the engine is running which would then mean that all of the electrical components are just using the battery in which over time in will lower its voltage, in which is maybe whats casuing the ecu to go mad and all the lights coming onto the dash.
If Novitec did mods that Ferrari say voids the warranty, then Novitec should make the car right. They should tell you raving the car on a cold engineer snot wise.
I’d be so pissed if I spent that money and it kept having issues!
This is why you buy lamborghini. They are a lot more reliable
Nico, Great Video, your problem with the Ferrari is the ECU computer, I have the same issue with my Ferrari powered Maserati Quattroporte. The dash would light up like a Christmas tree after being serviced. Nobody could find the problem? After 3 months, they linked to a computer with the Maserati engineers and I was told it needed a new ECU computer. It was replaced problem gone . Have them check the computer it controls the entire car.  Cheers mate
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
so what you’re saying is… they checked every wire, every connection and every fuse?
pay that premium and get errors like a ten year old citroen ... pure overpriced shite
@Nico, first of all, hope everything is OK with your mother! Secondly, glad it was just a battery. Impressive how Ferrari could not diagnose it.. i am afraid once they noticed the mods they didn’t even try to understand the issue. On the battery itself, its uncommon that a fairly new battery just fails.. it could happen, sure, but it’s unexpected.. just make sure that there is no parasitic draw…
🤘😎🤘🚗💨🇬🇧
Well hope to see the next episode soon and trust áll will be solved. Thanks for the follow up.
Nico leaning his bare arm on those battery terminals scared the shit out of me! 😂
Buy a porsche
Ermm.. did they check the diode packs in the alternator? Diodes short sometimes and flood the electrical system with voltage spikes.. might be worth a test. Can't imagine it's good for the battery either
Ferrari is such a terrible company for all the money you pay for these things. They were SO quick to jump on the "you did an out of warranty upgrade" and all it had to with was a freaking battery! Says more about their mechanics and shops!!! TERRIBLE!
Ferrari is garbage, that's why you gotta rely on aftermarket...lolol
Maybe return the car to the stock exhaust system  to see if that makes the engine codes go away? At any rate hope your mum is ok now.
I like Nico, he seems a great down to earth guy
You should be able to return the battery then under warrenty
Now make it GTS N-Largo lol 😂
❤ wow congrats on getting your ride back 🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
Moral of the story, buy a lamborghini not a ferrari.
Nico I strongly suggest getting a non Ferrari battery! Their batteries suck! I used the non lithium Braille battery (cost about $350 USD).
Hope all is well with your mother. By the way That is one badass Hublot you have on 😂😂😂😂
I'd investigate the alternator and any electrical grounding points.
Congrats on getting her home, keep us posted. Intermittent errors are the worst
please get a vauxhall lotus carlton you'll be pleasantly surprise
I would say you have a dodgy alternator
Too broke to pay the shutterstock subscription?
So long winded.
I have a Ferrari GTC4Lusso, and have issues like this with my battery too. After swapping it out, it works great. I also bought an after market exhaust from Novitec, and my dealer made it clear that if I put it on, even just the X Pipe, they would not allow me to extend the warranty again, making it void. Given the cost of repairs on this car, ensuring the warranty is valid is very important to me.
When I bought mine, I was told the two best days of your life would be a)When you buy it & b)When you sell it.... The statement rings true but you can't beat pushing that red button every morning and hear her come to life (hopefully)... Keep persisting, owning such a beast isn't easy but its worth it :)
Love this guy a really genuine guy can’t wait to see more car content hope ya mums well on the mend nico ❤❤❤
Need to do some voltage monitoring as it looks like there's something not right with your electrical system.  Could be alternator realted or could be something else. Does the car have any sort of hybrid capacity, regen function etc?
maaruh ... hoe is het met de gezondheid van je moeder?
Don’t buy a Ferrari. 😂
Then drive it it not a watch its a super car drive it shut up and drive let's here the beautiful engine sound u talk to much drive
I called it! I knew it was the battery as superspeedersrob had the exact same faults as you with his 488.
I think it’s an earth problem causing the issue
Glad Moms ok Nico! I really enjoy watching your videos! You are a humble man and Deserve everything you get in life, my friend
What is QUID??
Fckn hell tooka while to post lol
Hope your mums ok and you get the GTS issues resolved, rather frustrating I imagine; keep going chap!
Honestly as much as you want and have added personal touches to the ferrari just get rid of it now. Their service is garbage and their customer service is terrible. And on top of it all if you even change a valve stem cap and your warranty is void..... just get Brabus to build you something or get into something other then a ferrari. Live the content hope you sort something out. People should stop buying ferraris until they stop controlling everything like a bubble wrap parent.
Sounds like either the regulator in the alternator is playing up or try running an extra earth wire from the engine ECU to the chassis. Back in the early 90's when I worked for Scania trucks we where getting simulator random fault codes and it turned out to be the problem because they started to use the ECU to switch earth's for signals and the little earth wires couldn't carry the load that was required. Hope your mom is felling better.
Surprised it took 2 weeks to say it was the battery. Would of thought that would be the first port of call!!  Either way glad it’s back and let’s see more content with this beast!
Something must of happened to kill the battery, so something as simple as a dodgy relay somewhere could be dropping the voltage just enough on a certain circuit which throws up the error codes. As with most modern cars they are very voltage sensitive unfortunately
Glad you got your whip back buddy
Its always batteries with cars like that. Im surprised that wasnt the first thing you tried.  Also. Economy of words. Just an idea.
What about the alternator I think is bad or going to die
What a rollercoaster of a video mate, I was so pleased for you mid way through. Sad to see the warning lights return but glad to see you arrive back safe and sound. Life is not linear, you have ups and downs. It's how you deal with the troughs that defines you
Well deserved brother! Don’t give any attention to the negative comments. You show up for your family and your employees — keep up the good content!
Hope your Mum is well mate.
Very humble
I know its stupid but maybe its something wrong with the dashboard display...
⭐✌️
i had 2 of them, both with weird problems, but these were finally solved by the Lamborghini dealer... made by vw... proper cars...
So is the warranty void as the car still has the Novitec exhaust? Might sound amazing but probably not worth the invalid warranty on such a specialist car.
Your computer on the car needs  A reprogram. Hopefully
Italian dog eggs
Are you still buying DDE's cop car?
Is it a Dutch thing to repeat and repeat what you said 1/2 a second ago?
It’s just a car (A fu**ing amazing car, but just a car) your mum being taken ill in Finland that’s what matters, family are everything, cars can be fixed, it’s a headache but family getting better is what counts. Wishing your mum a speedy recovery and I’m sure the gremlins in the Ferrari will get resolved one way or another👍🇬🇧
Ìmagine having a problem with your Ferrari and they just say yeah you changed the exhaust so you've got no warranty anymore. Way to stand behind your product if you say that your car can't handle an exhaust.
They would have to exchange that car no questions
Don't take so long to post the next car video Nico! Was waiting so long for this one. Hope mum gets better mate.
As you said, nice people doing nice things for other nice people. That's the way the world should work! It's certainly the way I like to live my life anyway! 👌 Bigbup Novitec, Brabus and Jack.
Keep your head up nico
👏🏻👏🏻 loving this content and the fact that you started this because your love of cars is brilliant. I had anxiety watching your journey home so I can’t imagine how you felt at the time
Mate this video is bullocks
Nico is a fuc*ing legend 🔥
Somebody is trying to kiss ferrari’s ass, but love your vids still :D
Grande Nico!!!
Keep on smashing it kidda 😎😉
Your editor fucked up the video btw !
How much did they pay you for this to shut up!!?
You might have a problem with the alternator. If it can’t hold the battery voltage steady it can cause a whole bunch of electrical malfunction signals to go off. Or if it’s over charging, it could be the reason it messed up the original battery
I hope you're gonna sort out the novitec mechanics with cool watches ! Lol would make a great video too
glad you’re mom is okay and I’m happy the car is sorted Nico!! Like I said in the first video of the ferrari breaking, should’ve just contacted Novitec first and foremost and you wouldn’t have dealt with Ferraris bullshit !!
Not that I"m in that tax bracket anyway, but I dislike Ferrari as a company for exactly this kind of BS. But no one can deny, they build a damn beautiful car.
nico as been watching your vide0s from day 1 as i am glad in 1 why that you got your car back as my heart for you as i really hope you can get this proplem sorted out as i await for the next vid
Pretty disgusting how Ferrari over an exhaust swap can’t wait to void your warranty, I’ve heard that Ferrari isn’t very pleasant to deal with from a number of people. Novitec on the other hand seems like they genuinely care about their customers and good on them for that
Hope your family is ok. But Ferrari are just bills waiting to happen. Better luck next time
It's refreshing to see someone that's humble and genuine that has that level of success you have obtained for yourself, you deserve that Ferrari!
Take it back !
Look,  it's a story and we have a few.. Mines not a Ferrari a Honda!!  Lovely car you have,  great spec, hope your mums ok.  Crack on to the next story.
Come check out my Ferraris when you’re in NL. Watches and Ferraris. Vintage stuff
Did not the first guy who recovered the car ( the recovery guy ) say it was the battery , or are my mistaken , brilliant video's .
Nico! Legend! 🙌🏻 Home Your car gets on road ASAP! 🖤👍🏻
You may need to put a novitec sticker on back
Imagine a car like that waiting around shitting the bed waiting for it to fail again  First thing is to get the exhaust off and run it and see if that changes anything  Fact it’s happening when you stop and not makes me think alternator? Complete novice here lol
Love you Nico but you made a 5min video 20min long 😝😂🙈 you rambling King 🫶🏼
Great video Nico, keep the car content coming!
Wow brabus ceo legend
It needs to go back to Ferrari...
Hey Nico,  since your car issue improved after replacing the battery, is it possible your issues could be related to your alternator???? Best wishes to you and your family.
Nico, how is your mother?
Wow !
Warranty or not, I`d get Ferrari to an alternative battery or find an alternative battery yourself and have possibly more than 800CCA. To what I have heard, people do get a lot of electrical gremlins on Ferraris and one of the most common reasons is battery and people that have experienced similar issues - they end up replacing batteries once every year or two depending on where they live and weather.
As if Ferrari didn’t try and change the battery?! 🤦‍♂️
Hope your mum is on the mend, get the alternator and charging circuit checked out
Hope your mum is on the mend, get the alternator and charging circuit checked out
I'm so glad that Mia is fixed bro shout out to brabus luck of the draw bro
Your capping bro. You think we’re stupid. If it was throwing errors still you would have showed it in film. I love you and your content but this was a pathetically amateur attempt at leaving a cliffhanger for your audience
You need to keep it hooked up to a battery tender at all times when not driven.
Loose ground for sure.
Sod the car, how's your mum doing? You need to return to stock and hand back to fix, Ferrari's are a nightmare when you change something, by design!
Just buy Porsche and not put up with this cr@p  GT3 RS 992 is race bred.  A proper tool.
is the alternator charging the right volts/curent
nico hats of to you and being honest that it was just an battery. and I hope your mum's OK ❤
We told you it was a battery....
❤❤
Put it back to stock for a moment and give it back to Ferrari to sort out on warranty. Glad you got to see your mum and dad. Make sure they were ok first. Car isn't that important compared to them. Glad you had good friends to help you out when you were in need. 👍🏻👍🏻
Looks like we will be seeing ya on Boucher Road again. Nice guy with a lovely motor. You are 100% correct. It's a big PC. If the battery fixed it for a while then when you where driving and stopping. I'd start with the charging system or something thats plugged into in the causing a power drain. Anyhow, best of luck and hope ya get it sorted soon.
Hope everything will workout 💪🏻
It’s probably the after market exhaust
Glad your folks are ok. That’s a positive
Hate it when you lose confidence in your car where you never have a relaxing drive with the fear of breakdown!! All the best and above all hope your Mum is well.
You still like Ferrari even 8 mos later.Biggest mistake, you did not keep it simple..i admire you, you still singing HALLELU1 TO FERRARI..THE PROBLEMWAS, COLLECTING DATA AND NOBODY DECIPHERED IT PROPERLY,   BATTERY ? THATS THE CHEAPEST THING TO DO, REPLACE THE BATTERY.
Novitec and Brabus are top notch! Glad they resolved it all…so is the battery under warranty or did the novitec exhaust break it? Lol
I had crazy errors on mine, like other people have suggested it turns out the alternator was on its way out sometimes there was voltage there sometimes it just dropped out and there was no charge coming in and the less than 8 month old battery was fried as well.
I’m a Ferrari owner, mine drives well, nothing bad (mine’s stock btw). Give me yours (I’m Italian) and I’ll take care of it! Would be an amazing content
Excellent content as always Nico. Glad the Ferrari is much more sorted! Hope its properly fixed soon.  Great support from Novitec and Constantine at Brabus. Love the Patek World Time too. Stunning!
Niko you are a Legend! Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours and I wish your parents nothing but the best!❤ keep up the hard work and the great videos!🤌
Is it not possible that the alternator or voltage regulator is failing?
My dream would be to meet you and get to know you
Your are a good man Nico. So everything must have to be good with you. Keep going buddy. Also really happy for your car 😇
Every wire,  every fuse
Alot of new cars require a constant 12 volt connection and they make a plug that goes into your cigarette lighter or obd2 port while you change your battery so the car gets tricked into thinking the battery new was changed
It's a 400k Ferrari that gets smokes by a 125k C8 Zo6
Everything pales in comparison to family, hope mom is ok.
At first I would say that the issue came from some sensor in the exhaust as some Ferrari got a strange ghost mod a cause issue like smoke or christmas tree on the dash from late model production and as the car try to understand what happens it keep refresh it, but novitec is a well known brand nothing to prove with quality or handling issue as seen in the video, I hope belfast will find the issue, but most important family first
Every Brand has a lemon, hope you get yours right.
Been waiting for this video for so long
So many people who clearly didn’t watch the whole video…car is still broken…
How the fuck are Ferrari still using batteries from a fucking Ford transit!!! WtAf! 😱
Nico go back to stock, and see whats happen.
Dude you are really amazing!! Your energy is awesome!! Hope you fix this very good car!!
My life is cars and watches
Cars help meeting new people and making friends and contacts
Ferrari is the Hublot of cars, that is you fault for buying that, there is a reason why a lot of people stop buying Ferrari. Buy yourself a Lambo or another brand that give a damn.
You sure they checked EVERY fuses, EVERY wires ? Just checking, to be sure.  Jk Nico love your videos mate !
moral of the story ... don't buy a Ferrari.
You are the man
Hats off Novitec, hats off. This is the pinnacle of attention for your customer, above and beyond.
New car new battery so what was wrong with the battery?☹️ And how’s your mum? But did they go through every wire every plug every connection do you know?😂
i can’t imagine the amount of frustrations and heartbreak that comes from something (car) that you love so much and all you wanna do is to enjoy it 😢
Can't see how you can still say how great Ferrari are when they shit on your warranty without even knowing what the issue was. Also doubt that Novitech would do all that for free for a customer who wasn't a YouTuber with over 1.6m+ subscribers who was just launching a car channel.
When Ferrari themselves cannot fix it, a German car tuner can fix it ;-)
A new battery, especially on a luxury/exotic car needs to be programmed to the car. I know it sounds crazy but just went through a similar situation. Hopefully that’s all it is.
Glad you got the Ferrari sorted! Hope you mum is ok and on the mend
We support you
Glad the car is back on the road. You deserve it! But the most important thing is that I hope your mom is recovering. All the best mate.
Amazing news that it’s an easy fix. Can’t wait for the next videos.
Flog it buy a fiesta 😂❤
Constantin is the man! More than a brother ❤
First things first:how’s your mother? Secondly, as an Italian, let me say that the Ferrari customer service is well beyond par. To say the least.
Hope you're mammy is ok Nico. It is a beautiful looking car, black and yellow looks great. Not too many Ferrari,s in Ireland. Its your car why wouldn't you do what you want with it, lots of people tune their cars.
Novitec probably repaired the vehicle for free because their name was associated with a bad experience to a large YouTuber - a large YouTuber that makes videos luxury goods. It's a no brainer for them since they're also in the luxury goods market themselves.
Why don’t you find your first ever car and bring it back
With Charles Hurst it's a class issue...if ur spending big money they'll kiss your arse. If your spending "normal" money they are shite to deal with ...I'm speaking from resent experience  !!!
You don't own the product when you finance a product. When you own a product, you don't make monthly/annual payments
F in battery 😂 good job it was nothing to bad
Hi my name is Nico leonard and I like Ferrari. Sounds like an AA meeting.😅
Everything happens for a reason I was waiting for this video to see the outcome and happy that you are back home, cheers from PANAMA central America.
Mate! That is some bangin content bruv!!
Fight traxnyc Max
sounds like a battery drain if it keeps happening when you're stationary. you should check the battery when the car is turned off and see if it's pulling too much power from the battery
So happy the Ferraris back. If I may, there is something I noticed with this video. It’s 20 minutes, yet  I feel with some slightly more specific editing it would be closer to 10 minutes. We are given the same information several times over, and it made it a less than fun watch. I think so slightly tighter editing would lead to even better watch times, and I would definitely enjoy the video more. Hope I don’t come off as rude, I genuinely want to see this channel go far.
Beautiful car Nico! Biiiig fan. Interested to see how Ferrari manage this…
FINALLY! Benn waiting for this video for ages
👍👍👍
You'll have to sort some casio's out for those guys 🤙
Good to see the Rarri back Nico, hope Mother VDH is doing well 🤘❤
Glad everything worked out for you! Mostly 😅
Another Great video
So it’s not the battery I’m confused
A petrol vehicle relying on a battery , imagine an EV depending on petrol ? It’s coming 😂
JEZUS CHRIST ON  A MOTORBIKE!!  Finally we get to know what happened :D
Sell the fkhaging carr mate
Graper automotive in Moordrecht kan je helpen.
Ok, so a fully charged battery works...and it seems it degrades over time which could cause these issues. So the only thing which could do this is the charge from the alternater. It could either be inconsistent charge from the alternater or a draine from a faulty earth. Ferrari should be able to solve it.
Put it back to stock, turn it in to Ferrari and tell them to fix it (you mentioned that Ferrari told you they would honor the warranty if it was put back)... sounds like a faulty computer somewhere. A module or ecu. Lovely car but the customer service/warranty is lacking for such a high dollar car. Electrical faults will drive you crazy and drain your wallet.  Brilliant service from novitech though!
I think the problem is that your car doesn't like the weather of Northern Europe.... Just too much moisture in the air/fuel mixture... Driving North causes problems... Simply a case of Seasonal Affective disorder... Stay in Southern Europe and problem will be solved.
Nico, you are a legend. Wish you best of luck with this new channel!
Give the owner a new watch for all there support
That's nuts. All of that drama over a battery. Mental. So glad it's all sorted and fixed my friend. Hope your mum and family is doing well
I hope your mom is good and healthy. You should have bought a Porsche lolol it’s a beautiful car!
Finally a video🤣🤣
the ashes on the B pilar Nico be smoking in the rrari
Fuck the car.  How’s ya mum?
How is your mum doing? Look forward to your car channel 😊
So pleased for you Nico and I hope your mother is 100%. Novitech is a well good company to pick up and go through the whole thing proving their work was not faulty. Brabus what a legend your friend is getting you to your mother as fast as can be. Ferrari ownership seems to be a bit of a hit and miss like other car brands it seems 1 car can be perfect and another can be a real pain in the A.... Lets hope they can find the pain in your cars electronics ASAP.
It's a lemon. Get rid of it
Well done to brabus and novitec for helping nico  If I was paying £4k a month for it, that heap would be parked in a Ferrari dealer until it was fixed and I wouldn’t pay a penny more till then either
Let me be honest with you... Even if the car fixes you are gonna have the fear of it breaking down randomly and stranding you somewhere and there will be no Ferrari to help you instead of blaming you. I would prefer you to sell this car off. I know you love it but it hasn't been the best and neither the brand has been best with you . Go for a Lambo.  You buy a Ferrari when you wanna be someone But you buy a Lambo when you are somewhere and you are there nico  Just for you best. Rest the decision is your gonna keep watching your stuff anyway cos I love you for your content and not for the materialistic items
#LoveNovitec what about a periodic Generator failure. so it cant charge the battery enough to be at the rightvolt and gives you periodic errors?
Lots of profit in watches 🙄
big up Nico! no click bait or clout chasing, just a cool dude! respect!
Sounds like Ferrari could not wait to simply void the warranty... "made modifications..." ... What kind of car breaks down when exhaust is replaced/upgraded... so dumb...
get a lambo
The issue is these cars are so complex when you mod them even if that doesn't cause the problem you give the brand the perfect excuse to walk away from the warranty, great car hope you get it sorted.
Sorry you're having the issues
Trim your bloody nose hairs you honker. Beautiful story with the car btw, may it last many generations.
Love all your videos! Keep up the great work and keep enjoying that 812! Cars are meant to be driven...
Chris said it was the battery straight away lol - glad its fixed
You bought a lemon ,,,,, sell it
Great car every vehicle and has their own problems You do what you love and you love Ferrari and that's what counts
I don't believe none of it
Unplug your phone charger from the car and the errors should disappear god knows why but it does
Actually the bank owns it until it’s paid off and the title is in your company’s name!
Glad you have your car  back and hope your mum is ok 👍 👍
How poor is the editing of this video 🤔🤔
finally
Ferrari is shit. Faulty battery and they won’t even honour the warranty.
Good to hear your car is fixed….question; why would a dodgy battery cause all those lights to come on and stop running the car
I am glad the car is fixed, but a Ferrari with these issues, and how they treat you is just wrong...even if I had the money, I would never give these guys one penny. The are the Rolex of car brands, thinking they are the best and you need to feel lucky to be allowed to buy one....trash
Make the car Stock again to make it a Ferrari problem and not your problem! You can always swap back again when the issue is sorted!
need new control box/computer
Let's Go!!!!! Looks like my comment on the other channel was heard. Can't wait to watch this vid.
What happened to other videos?
Editor must have been on acid:)
What a bunch of amateurs. The battery is the FIRST component to check, not the last. And everyone missed it! 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
More car vlogs !!!! We like this side of things
piece of shit car.....i would sue Ferrari
Good advert for novitec
Fust check all electrical additions made from when you took delivery, trackers, alarms, cameras, phones, battery conditioner, anything and everything, something is draining the battery, after this alternator etc. Its not the ferrari at fault, its something thats been added for sure....
Please get the ECU to someone to check it , but before grab a voltage meter and check the car from cold all the way to warming and hot cycle if the voltage stays around 14,2V or goes higher o stays way lower.
Wonder if you have a loose or poor earth connection or if the alternator  is throwing its tits in?!
Very perplexing what the problems are with the 812 . Hopefully that you are back home Hurst's will finally sort out her gremlins and you will finally have your dream car you always wanted without the problems that you are expierencing now. Keep the chin up lad it will be all right in the end.
sell it and buy a Porsche 911 gt3 rs
Honestly, it makes Ferrari look worse. Instead of trying to figure it out they decided to walk away. Sad part is the Battery should still be under warranty…
Feels like forever waiting for this video, so glad it was simple and you got it sorted.
Generator might be fucked?
How is your mum doing?
At least you have it back home now so you can finally get her sorted.. Hope your Mum is better..
Ferrari voids warranty over exhaust. Hard to imagine being ok with Ferrari.
I’ve this Abt mclarens not sure if it works but try to start the battery before the engine and wait a few seconds before starting the engine
Just a quick question Nico...  Did they go through every wire, every fuse, every plug and every connection? Not sure you said 🤣🤣   Great journey and privileged to have been brought along! Congrats on getting the car back, here's to many adventures to come, and props to you for prioritising your family 🙌🏻 a quality we see far less nowadays!
I get being poor and making something of yourself…be proud!
Hope your mum is feeling better! check for a dodgy ground or flakey alternator, low voltages gives cars all sorts of gremlins!
Screw the car, hope your mom is ok!
U shit the bed on this one Nico Ferrari is the worst super car brand most of the owner are stuck up old bastards and Ferrari are always the once to send u cease and desist
The way this is going Ferrari will be in the same tier as Hublot 😂🤣😂🤣😂
I am not mechanic, but i had the same with my old e60 535 and it was alternator not charging battery, and before battery was dying i would receive lots shite from ecu
I have so much more respect for Novitec after seeing this video.  Great guys.
348 nice stylis car . sh.t to drive :D
Faulty alternator not charging the battery or maybe computer draining the battery when parked ..
Get your police car from DDE that would be great
Good luck with it Nico. I live in Cheshire but from Belfast and always come home to get my new car from Charles Hurst…
All the best for you, Nico. If I was in that situation, I couldn't trust the car anymore, by any means. Had this once with an unrealiable start were I just permanently scared for error messages or strange noises to reappear. Takes all the fun out of a car. Unfortunately, I don't know if Ferrari would do anything about it even if you reinstalled the original exhaust. Doing modifications during the leasing period unfortunately isn't the best idea... and if you do, make sure the manufacturer doesn't find out about it. Hope you can solve the situation asap.
That watch is awesome! lol iykyk
this should be on main channel get that $$$$
Great vid loving the car segment you should wear a watch the same value as the car your driving and at the end decide what one you would spend the money on at the end I would defo watch that 😂 hope your mums ok by the way
Nice to see all coming back together. Hope all is good
4:56-5:15 Nico laughs like fat bastard 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Novitec has been around for years and does need even need to prove their worth. Thier product speaks for itself and in this video, Nico shows how absolutely genuine they are. Amazing company and brand.
Alternator over charging battery making it over heat
I am not in any way a mechanical engineer, but: if replacing the battery with a new one fixed the problem for a while, it seems to me that the battery is not being charged properly.  Are you sure there is nothing wrong with the Alternator? If you have already checked it - could it be that after you installed the new exhaust system, it added too much heat close to where the alternator is installed? That could potentially be causing it to malfunction under the heat stress. Or, perhaps, it could make some other mechanical part stops working, which in turn will prevent the Alternator from working as it is supposed to.  It would be a good idea to leave the car running hot for a while and then test the Alternator and all charging battery components to see if the battery is really getting the charge it needs.  I know for a fact that some electrical components do not like excessive heat at all - especially microchips (WHICH in this case Ferrari is using it in a lot of places for sure). For instance, a resistor might increase/decrease resistance which would be enough to make any type of AC/DC conversion/regulation useless. Or a micro processor/controller in charge of checking battery charging cycles could completely stop working under high heat. All of which could be the root cause of the battery being drained completely.
How did myself and many others say "battery" Yet Ferrari themselves didnt twig And it took Novitec 3 weeks to diagnose.  :(  As for the continuing issues,, I wonder if the new battery is also faulty or is something in the electrical system killing the batteries
We have had new Ferrari coming in threw my work and all the lithium batteries have been removed for normal lead ones now
Let’s forget about the Ferrari for just a moment and switch to the most important; hoe is het nu met je moeder?
This sounds like grounding issue. The battery probably not charging properly. And can come back until you find where the bad connection is clean it and obtain a solid ground.
alternator possibly not keeping the battery charged?
maybe something with the inverter?
Goeie content Nico! Ik hoop dat het beter gaat met je moeder? Daar deed je geen uitspraak over. Vette bak, dik verdiend ! Wees er zuinig op
Get ground lead to battery checked out.
I liked your 911 GTS more :)
Nico much respect brother. So much. Keep going.
Love the car content Nico, keep it up
sell it for a 1000 pounds too
Maybe he’s alternator is bad? The same shit happened with my civic and I replaced the battery and the Christmas tree kept coming back.  What’s weird was my 09 Civic was acting exactly like his 812 GTS. The issue was that turning off and on the car would make the alternator work and sometimes it wont, i just replaced the alternator and with a new battery, it was perfect again.  Now ik people will bash me for comparing a 400k car to a 4k one, but trust me a car is a car.
Nico you are the watch guy. Now you are a car guy, welcome to the club
just the battery 🤣. happy and mad on the same time
Flog it and buy a Brabus !!!
Finally uploaded the video we all being waiting for. Thank you.
Breakdown or not we still had a great time ❤
Hope your mothers doing better now Nico.  Why oh why Ferrari in Monaco didn't check the battery voltage first, such an easy fix!!!
Since it was a brand new car nobody thought about the battery. Who would imagine.
Maybe it is the Novitec system after all
Hope your mother is well I would suspect Bad earth point or A bad charging relay should take more time to destroy the battery, but might be worth looking at so it doesn't charge too much, computers don't like too much power either
You've worked your arse off and deserve your rewards in life. 👏
Italian cars have caracter and like humans they have faults but eventually you will understand the problem and everything will be ok. Hoping the best for you big hug from Portugal
Twenty bucks it's NOT the battery.  I bet the problem has reoccurred in the time this video has been published.
It can go back to stock but Ferrari now has the vin in their system. Warranty will forever be void. It was void because of Novitec tuning the car. Not the physical mods
Thanks nico for the spin offer ❤❤❤ love you brother
Was excited for this next episode… dull. Yappa yappa yappa
Get your Harley’s on the channel too
good to see some one living ther dreams
Test the altinator amperage, start there
Round of applause for Novitech and Brabus for everything they did for Nico. And i would imagine that Ferrari feel rather Sick and shows there Customer Service Sucks. 400K for a car and they try to Dodge the problem by voiding the warranty. Nice car but crappy service.
Sounds like there’s a drain on the battery somewhere that’s making the ECU shit the bed… did you a third party immobiliser/ tracker fitted ?
could it be you have a lemon?
they did code the new battery in!!!!!!!!Italian electrics!! what can you say !  hope your mums ok nico .
Family comes first hope your mother is ok now.  I watch these videos as recovering from a big Cancer operation they cheer me up and I’m now a budding watch/car expert great work Nico and Team x
Do not lean on batteries with your clothing, they have acid in them. 🤔
Put it back to stock, take out all the aftermarket stuff. How can this car not be good enough? It’s a Ferrari, don’t mess perfection. All the best to your family. Thanks
I won! Thank you Nico ❤❤❤
I love the new editing
Safe to say even after putting a car back to stock and bragging about mods to the world……. Ferrari ain’t touching it with a barge pole. That things got game over written all over it.
your a legend
Ask the guy who sold it to you about all the problems.. HE KNOWS  thats why he sold it..
good luck Nico hope to see you ripping around Belfast when you get Mia running right again
im so disappointed in Ferrari the brand but their cars are unbelievable
The GPS tracker probably is messing with the battery, same thing happened to me.
Mercedes also does V12 engines... reliable ones. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ74Oo55epc
You have a faulty ECU it
Hope your mam’s better mate…you should’ve given the ferrari to matt for his next project 😂😂
My 996 targa did the same  while driving Christmas tree lights on the dash and wouldn't start ? ALTERNATOR REGULATOR
Italians + Wiring = Disaster
How's your Mum, Nico?
Good people doing good things my ass..lucky that you have a big followers otherwise this story would have had a different ending
Low voltage can do some weird stuff to cars.
Hello from Finland sad to hear your mom's situation
People who said Novitech caused it have no idea what they're talking about.  Imagine blaming an exhaust swap for a complete electrical breakdown lol. Good to see you have your dream car back Nico, and sorry it's still shitty the bed. I can't imagine finally getting your dream car and it's plauge with issues.  Oh btw, German Horse>Italian Horse. Just saying :P
Keep moving forward. People always have something to say. Do what's best for you.
Ramblings of an addict?
Not sure if I missed it but did they check all the wiring, connectors and stuff?
I do hope your mother is better. Sending her positive vibes her way.
And that’s why I deserve a Rolex
Don't think I would buy a car like that with financing. Would make me sleepless
FN Battery 😅
My grandmother (106 years old) passed yesterday.  I know what you are going through.   Hug them as many times as you can.  When you can.
Constatin sent a Brabus Smart 🤣 what a lad.
Been too long finally it's here!!!!
Imagine needing something and your friend the CEO of Brabus just shows up and fixes everything, what a legend!
Finalllyyyy!!
Finally about time
Finally! We’ve been waiting forever to watch this video. Only a month late😂
First :D
