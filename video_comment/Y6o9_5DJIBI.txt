Jojo with that black makeup looks like an attempt to cosplay like a Kiss member, but less confident: I'm very edgy! Look at how edgy I'm being!
I need this to be revisited so I can hear you speak on JoJo's tradwife era without having to watch it first hand 😂
Haha
Not the sad mettaton music in the background ❤ 4:48
Nooooo my birthday is the date of the Karma release 😭
“i’m the first person to ever do this” BRO LOOK AT DOVE CAMERON🤦🏼‍♀️ she is the og for gen Z imo
oh boy did jojo not age well
My uncle's name is Shane Dawson...
I can guarantee this is gonna be another “Friday” situation in like 5 years
Sad thing is she went through a 10-day SAS special forces training quite well, then later just went insane. lol
jjba reference made me cry tears of joy
If she thinks she’s one of the first people to have this vibe i think she should get into black metal bands
oh
The song should have been released on April 1st because it’s such a joke.
Basically we're watching a gen x act like a millennial who thinks they are like so quirky and like so weird for liking coffee, so basically she combined the two worst aesthetics in existence
JoJo just looks like my 7 year old cousin.
4:11 That's one heck of a profile you've got, Chad. Really beautiful.
9:37 this is so fucking funny how it fits the choreography xD
HARVEY. HARVEEYYY  FUCKING BASED I LOVE HARVEY
6:19 glisten..
Sounds like her mom is like, the root of all the problems here......Actually y'know what, sounds like Jessica Siwa should just like, be in jail, or at least taken to court, for decades of child abuse, of both her own and others'
fellow Harvey lover <3
1:51 i used to play that song on repeat. I still remember the words to D.R.E.A.M…😔🙌
4:51 not the undertale music 😭
Her mom is the real villain. May jojo be hilarious right now, in reality it's most likely her moms fault.
2:18 I thought it said I am a bald girl 😂😂😂😂😂
I shut the video off at fiddlesticks, i don't need to hear that potty mouth.
The female version of Jake paul
👍
Chad chad jojo is on her trad wife era now. We need you
0:34 my dumbass thought she said Hephaestus. 😔
9:02 STOP IT CHAD CHAD HEA MINE
If she went on I'd be cool with it. Like if her new music had a super heavy sort of metal type of vibe, that'd be alright. But the songs all STILL feel like generic pop.
9:21 sick moves chad chad. Keep it up
Some might say, it's JoJo's bizzare adventure
4:44 mettaton song 😍
never heard her voice before. why does she talk like the plucky "tomboy" female lead of an early 2000s animated movie
Sleep mode turned on right as she said bye
jojo give chad chad her money back
She looks like she smells like ham
Why is her voice so raspy like "I remember when they invented chocolate ☹️" but she's a child... sounding like she chain smoked for 30 years during ww2
I love how they bedazzled her balding ratchet pony tail head
Yeah karma a b* JUST LIKE YOU, JOJO!
SHE CAME BACK LIKE A BOOMERANG THAT WAS MEANT TO NEVER COME BACK!
Can we mention about how the actor for Sydney Lou who in the Grinch is now a rockstar in a band? There has been more severe changes.
i just keep thinking karma akabane man. karma jojo siwa no Karma akabane  why am i assclass brainrotted
I'm so happy I'm not famous, because then  people would be making videos about why I started wearing weird stuff suddenly but like 30 different styles every week for 5 years.
The idea that her mom is probably quite involved in the rebrand is first of all, pretty uncomfortable (imagine talking about how to “sex up” your image with your mom??) and also pretty sad. The “I was afraid to sing these lyrics” thing makes more sense if she’s more afraid of her mom than the general public. It seems like Jojo really doesn’t have any identity separate from her mom or fame, and that can’t be good for her or anyone around her. I mean, it certainly isn’t good for the music.
The music at 3:20 is genuinely my alarm noise. I got crazy jumpscared
Jojo thinks she's "extreme" and "Edgy", just wait until she meets or here's YouTube sensation POPPY!!
10:12 I’m literally wearing a jojo cosplay
I got a glitch, and the YouTube app repeated the first 5 seconds of the video again and again.... best glitch ever 🥹
The last airbender dance is just chef's kiss 9:37 😂
Also Miley Cyrus was the forerunner of this switch-up, and she went through so much misogynistic abuse bc of her actions
Is this the one that got demonitised/Jo Jo's team stole the money??
2:15 To be honest I don't think anyone takes JoJo seriously.
coming here after the new chad chad video about jojo, what a shame her recreation of karma is gone :( it was quite fun
The fact Jojo took all the money from this video is upsetting to me
New subscriber here your videos are hilarious
JoJo's acid trip
2:17 at first I read this "I was a bald girl"
5:12 am i crazy or is the music from the tf2 soundtrack
a twingle of cringle
Rhea Ripley would be proud
Thanks for putting Tate McRae age in there..I'm off to do some Jiraiya Sensei level 'research'
I love the music in these videos😌
ARE WE JUST GONNA GLOSS OVER THE KISS STYLE PICTURE SHE USED ON HER OWN MERCH BUT DOESNT KNOW WHO GENE SIMMONS IS
JoJo's mother and production company should be prosecuted for child abuse, both for the dance show and xomg
You and funkyfrogbait should collab
God could you imagine if she's still doing cringy stuff like publicly cheating on her partner on live television with a man? Dude thatd be wild.  😬
München.
🤷Tbh, I like her song Boomerang. That's it. My sis used to be obessed with her tho. Her old style was cute, I liked it a lot.💖
12:03 Is that a pole in your living room? I am so jealous. Hahaha
Wait the anime is getting live adaptation???
Jojo: “I’m starting a new genre” Also Jojo: *proceeds to list other songs that are in that genre*
For some reason I watched Karma.....  I'll confess to liking Guilty pleased more cause it kinda has a melody   Karma....um....like wtf...
0:11  that one Roblox character in a random obby you decide to play
My mom’s friend used to be neighbors with Jojo Siwa and I thought it was so cool 😭
Jo? Jojo? JOJO'S BIZZARE ADVENTURE
3:00 The voice of an angel.
Crazy to call yourself extreme when you glue rhinestones on your ears with nail glue.
I love how bad chad chad is at segwaying into a brand deal
she brings out the asbestos in all of us
you make me laugh thank you my favorite jester!
big booba good
I’ve watched 4 of ur vids in 1 hour….time to speedrun all of your vids!
6:45 That car looks like it hit an invisible schoolbus full of Actual children.
Bro she'd be on the floor having a SEIZURE if she listened to any nu metal band
If I'd actually hurt myself tying to imitate that dance I'd have to off myself.
5:07 wait…is that what I think it is?
I also can't say 'I'm a bad girl' but that's cause that is the words the guy would say when i was sa as a kid...... soooooo we are two different gays jojo
I don't know why people have a problem with her style change I know that her music and the way she talks is annoying and not really a new thing but however she's dressed doesn't have anything to do with that
JoJo is on her Bizaare remodelling Adventure.
Female gene simmons:
chad sacrificed her knee for us 🥺
9:05 HARVEY MY BELOVED! YESSS HARVEY REFERENCE!❤❤❤❤ (Ngl, I’d definitely wanna do that for twelve hours too)
glad to hear your ears have never fallen out. that is great!
It’s weird to see a 3-foot tall synthetic penis carried by an adult woman with the face of a toddler. A cherub with a chub.
Chad Chad you are so funny! Don’t die.
who would have thought? somebody that acts as a 13 year old up until she is 20+ and all of a sudden, she gets edgy, wears black and does some silly makeup....that was me, when i was 13-14 years old. she is old enough to drink, looks like she already had 2 kids and a third is on its way, acts as if she is part of the trueman show and generally showed everybody in the world, how little educated she is. making money through kids should be as illegal, as child workers. maybe that would make youtube less pedo-ridden in the corpo-department? stop paying "child friendly channels". there is absolute NO REASON to pay a child money for doing essencially something, that MILLIONS of kids did in the beginning of youtube....but that time, without paying them 👍
Watching this 11 months later is trippy
Doesnt every child popstar do this basically
Sit down Chad Chad 0:24
standing chad chad makes me uncomfortable as well
3:21 this instantly reminded me of that one Vanoss Gmod Minecraft video lmao
Jojo released the song on my birthday. I'm forever cursed.
she is very gross and random and also annoying, kinda looks like a chubby boy
10:10 this is literally an episode of gravity falls
6:57 6:57  Car rapping went hard ngl
F#ddle-st#cks?!? 😜 How could you! My virgin ears, I so wasn't ready for that level of vulgarity. Trigger warning next time, please, whew. Lol
6:57 is so funny to me😂
What? No don’t do that… 😂
I’ve always been confused as to how she orchestrated a paparazzi shoot to catch her outside of a sex store and somehow managed to choose the most child friendly object you could get from one of those stores to be photographed with.
2:47 I love how she says this but gay pop kinda all ready exists
I keep mixing up JoJo Siwa and Yo Yo Ma
ITS ALMOST BEEN A YEAR SINCE THIS HAs HAPPENED??????????
I know this is an old video (great video btw), but IS THAT IN SPACE WITH MARKIPLIER ENGINEER MARK MERCH BACK THERE??? I got the Yancy tee, and recognized the style!!
I'm sorry, but you cant say you're entering your edgy era because your song has some cuss words in it and you're advertising it to hell when the entire world was given Miley Cyrus riding on a wrecking ball completely naked with absolutely no warning.
She wee-bwanded
9:02 LMAOO THATS SO REALL he is my fav stardew townie ‼️‼️🗣🗣
💯 blame Dance Moms
This was a good one.
I do not like Harvey from stardew valley
i was literally about to go as gene simmons for halloween but the amount of people telling me i’d look like jojo siwa made me switch to being a clown instead
Guys your discretion is advised, this is an 18+ comment; not for kids.    Shit.
Pretty sure she’s using the rebrand to try and get us all to forget that she defended known groomer colleen ballanger on howie mandels podcast while calling all her victims “liars.” 🤡🤡🤡
💀
0:11 she talks like a Minecraft Youtuber from 2013  playing in their crappy phone
I love rewatching these vids. I forgot about the Avatar dance part 😂
7:49 not the mr krabs walking sound 😅😅😅
9:18 MINDLESS SELF INDULGENCE????
9:03 THAT'S SO RELATABLE WHAT 😨
Jojos bizzare adventure irl
We have found the new avatar. 😂❤
So much vocal fry she sounds like RFK jr
4:29 ad break ended
Imagine devoting your entire life to being a professional dancer, only to be stuck in a studio with Jojo for 12 hours every day
Sitting Chad Chad makes me deeply uncomfortable
8:06 this part got me DYING🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:11 Why Does Jojo Sound Like Donnie Thornberry On Cocaine?
"i would have never f'd around" GIRL MY FRIENDS 3RD GRADE SISTER CALLED HER FRIEND A MOTHERFVCKER, UR NOT THAT BAD
Why are we not talking about hunk harvey
I honestly feel bad for her. Disney hell must have legit traumatized her. She doesn’t need a rebrand, she needs therapy and CPS.
who the fuck are you and who is jojo i don't understand any of these
YOU WERE AN ACCIDENT had me rolling
This is a pretty significant insult to the child stars that have come before her.  You know, the ones that actually ruin their, or the people around them lives.
She is feminine jake paul
I dont know why, but I find "fiddlesticks" to be such a cute "curse" word, I blame it on memes with a cute doggo and fiddlesticks in text written >.>
You are literally stealing Gabi Bell's content.
You are seriously funny. You should have your own Netflix special .
I’m not gonna hate on a young adult trying to rebrand. Like I thought we were shitting on things that are cringe AND socially dangerous
That ain't Jojo Siwa that's Jojo Seeforehead
Gosh       darn       gee whizz
Writing a comment to feed the algorithm.
Is this a jojo refrence
Whoever that Jo Jo melt is she’s an elite now. Part of the depopulation club.
I was promised a "Twnge of cringe". I got far more than that here
yip yip!
5:06 I noticed the tf2 music
Bones 😻🥰
everything is a jojo reference..
Her dance is just the club penguin dance animation
Not gonna lie, I was a little triggered by fiddlesticks.   Also calling what she's doing dancing is being realllllllly nice.
5:18 Olivia Rodrigo mentioned ‼️‼️
She’s a huge pretender trying to sell what she no longer had which is her childhood . Being worth 60 million is not enough so they need one more huge money grab and they used cripples to get it, Losers !
Chad, you made me laugh so hard I messed up my freshly painted nails! :,c I hope your knee is ok though! c,:
YOURE A FREAK FOR LIKING HARVEY
Was I the only one who expected an essay on how JoJo's bizzare adventures is getting weird and got disappointed...
chad chads perception of dance moms is honestly so realistic😭😭✋
Not to mention she LITTERALLY stole someone else’s song and “rebranded” it
I had a jump scare once hearing she was friends with Shane Dawson 🤯😂 that’s fucked
Jojo i really love you wen i was 3 but now i'm raelly sad😢
I just cant unsee her being Jake Paul without the beard
JOJOS MENTIONED AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WE LOVE YOU CHAD CHAD 🤑🤑🤑
What the hell is a “Jo Jo Siwa “ ?????
She kinda looks like flopsome, and jetsome from every little mermaid musical
9:03 same girly
ew ew ew ew dressing like a rock legend and not knowing who he is wtfffff
I can't even get myself to watch the musicvideo because the cringe will kill me
5:15 this guy's face was just my whole reaction to jojo's absurd rebrand😂
I find this Jojo siwa Era fun 😅
atwingofcringe.
I have this one clip of her doing the dance saved on Twitter because she makes a sound that goes “he-ha-hoo-heeeeeehhh” in the most weird way possible. I don’t think I really understand fully what a vocal stim is but it’s that for me
5:06 i respect the tf2 music
Not the medic tf2 music omg hello
That's not edgy that pretend punk
It ain't no Miley Cyrus' Can't Be Tamed.. Y'all, *that* was the JoJo Siwa of my time and it was a BANGER
Looks like in 10 or something years she will write a book about being a child star and how she even can't go through her "screw you" era without her mom making a big show out of it and everyone around was just laughing at her trauma
9:53 gotta get dat knee surgery bruzz huzz wuzz
"jojo have you learned NOTHING"
This was almost a year ago...
“ it was an accident!” “ YOUR AN ACCIDENT!!” Wowwww that’s crazy😭😭
4:28 press the time stamp to skip the ad read
5:12 AEHUM- does Melanie Martinez not exist anymore? DID YOU SEE HER CHANGE FROM HER Y2K PROJRCT K-12 TO FAE STUFF!?
Life is a JoJo reference ReROrerroReROrerroReROrerroReROrerroReROrerro
She took a trip to my friends school and he sent me videos of a sneak peek of her new song. It’s ungodly
She took  *“There's no such thing as bad publicity, even bad press is good press”*  to heart and ran with it. I'd rather have no one know who I am...then to have thousands of people want to throat-punch me. But I'm weird like that.🤷‍♀
When you hit a beat 0.000001 seconds too early in Rhythm Heaven: 1:07
Thank god the JoJo reference was made
Honestly you did a better job of that dance than Jo Jo did 😂😂😂😂😂
wtf america you ok?
Jojo looks like shadow from sk8 the infinity, not when hes in the flower shop tho, just the look he has in S
I had never heard about her until this year, but I feel so bad for her. Like sure, she's going through a cringe phase, but I went through like fifteen different cringe phases growing up (I went through two entire genders for crying out loud!), and the idea of having to do that in front of billions of people who are not just bullying you, but also documenting all of it forever, sounds like a nightmare.  And yes, I know that she is incredibly wealthy while children in Gaza are literally eating pigeon carcasses to not starve. I feel a billion times more bad for them than I do for her, but I've still got enough empathy in my heart that I don't need to ration it.
she reminds me of bojack horseman but somehow more pathetic
1:10 the funniest part is you're supposed to point your toes in ballet LMAO
Chad Chad . The new avatar . 9:39
She sounds like she's smoked cigarettes since she starred in Dance Moms
YASSS WE LOVEEEE HARVEYYYYYYYY
The fact she doesn't know Gene Simmons explains why she thinks this is what edgy looks like. I fully believe that the drama is the branding. "That had music... and video." sums up how I feel about it, as well.
Chad literally saying you wouldnt last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
JoJo: I created Gay Pop! Chappel Roan, Lady Gaga, etc.:👁️👄👁️
MILEYY!!
A twinge? This is a 50 gallon drum of cringe
damn JoJo's team is going crazy on the copyright strikes. every video I've seen about this has been demonitized or edited somehow by now
11:13 she can't even fully quote Taylor Swift here cuz she isn't edgy enough to even say "cuz she's dead"
I just watched the music video. So she's like "I'm a bad girl" and then she sings about how she regrets being a bad girl? That's...interesting.
4:04 Your house is beautiful
From a good girl to a bad girl, it's sad.
my knowledge of her is absolutely zero. i don’t even know her name. is she a musician?
Now I see where Mayhem took their makeup inspiration
😂😂
She has a doll head in a toy soldier's body
5:11 michael jackson maybe?😂
Have not heard one song by her.
a voice like an angel that chainsmoked 30 yrs 5 packs a day
tell me ur mentally ill and retarded without telling me  0:13
5:24 OMGGGG I LOVE TATE MCRAE SHES GORGEOUS OMGGGGGGGG
5:22 AHHH OMG SABRINA LOOKS SO CUTEE
4:30 ad stops
am i the only idiot that thinks she looks like the rock en roll troll from the movie trolls 2 when she is in her outfit.
I just feel bad for her
She looks like an actress of Starlight Express 😂
what was that twinge of cringe 😭😭😭😭
she always sounds like she screamed her ass off the night before.......
Aight I’ve seen enough, you fine af I’m down. What’s your snap?
10:19 JOJO REFERENCE
Jojo acting like she's about to sing WAP
9:02 Harvey?? You think you know a Chad...
6:15 WHY DID THE LIKE BUTTON LIGHT UP???
*me watching this while doing my makeup*
9:35 the avatar reference killed me holy shit
Oh not the bomb spaghetti
2:12 isn't that also the intro to swoop documentaries? Or am I tripping
you can tell that her entire life is controlled by her mum is actually scary, like i wouldn't be surprised if she has to ask her mum to go do anything
Don't know who this is. I feel like I'm better off
7:52 is that a T-shirt with her face?
The way you said she looks like kiss😭(your not wrong)
She needs job. OO
Meth meth meth
Sure Jojo is a lil cringe, super cliche etc. but like, I think it’s just a trend at this point to hate on her. Like I honestly don’t think the song was terrible, nor the choreography of the music video. She definitely overhyped it, I don’t deny that, but that’s kinda her job and whole brand lol, she’s also probably got contracts to fulfil with a record label, maybe sponsors, idk. But I just feel like it’s kinda weird for everyone to get together and collectively piss on a young adult woman like this. I know if I was in her position as a 21yo (same age) man, I’d be pretty fing sad alot of the time. Idk man it’s just a bit offputting.
I never comment on YouTube videos. But for some reason when I saw you bending all the elements during the dance, I died in the middle of the night laughing so I had to comment.
6:57 please tell me I'm not the only on that realized the coryxkenshin song
Watching this after finishing class of 09 the flipside hits weird
I'm still pissed at how it came out on my birthday 😭
Im scared af cus shes polish and she said shes going to go represent Poland for Eurovision for 2025 we're going to lose again
You have inadvertently turned the dance world on it's ear with your sick dance moves, at first I wasn't even sure what I was seeing, real game changer, the world of dancing will never be the same.
Damn, she should've gotten into a Psych Ward
You are the best. Keep at it and explore, Chadx2!
I made out with a clump of asbestos today
the tf2 music💀💀💀
She seems like the child of a fundamentalist family trying to fit in at a public high school soon after she gets there.
The fact that she was attempted to brand her music as 'gay pop' like 2 months before Chappel Roan's break out success completely pushed this song from their minds is coincidence so hysterical it's almost tragic.
Raycon is so prevalent that I clicked to the exact moment of ending of the ad. Well .....
8:53 This Stockfoto Meme had me crying of laughter
I have officially given up on humanity.
No one with teeth like that has ever been genuinely edgy.
i feel like she is just going through the awkward face we all go  through when teenager but she didn't had the chance, she is just very lost
Avatar the last commentator
Fiddlesticks
"nobody has made this dramatic of a change" does Miley Cyrus' debut as a woman and resulting culture war mean nothing to you
This video had me cracking up, man. Funniest video of yours that I have seen 😂
RIP Chad Chad's knee.
HARVEY!?? 🤢💀💀
Her voice sounds like she’s been screaming for years… oh wait-
Its just Kiss but bejeweled lmao
11:23 doesn’t it look kinda like fleshy creeper
5:19 what?! I loved bizardvark, what happeneddddddd!?…
Chicken
9:37 “Send word to the Fire Lord immediately! The Avatar has returned!!”
Loving Chad’s actual voice and excitement in the dance montage. So wholesome. ^-^
The commentary at the end about the music and the video says it all.. 💀😭
I think this rebrand had to happen because she was poorly received for coming out and was dropped by Nickelodeon. I am excited to see what else she might have in store.
i was watching this while drawinf ermes jolyne and f.f and seeinf the jojo reference was the best
Are you Drewina Gooden
jojo reference in a video about JOJO? ain't no fucking way everything really is a jojo reference after all
not the element bending at 9:37 lmao
My cousin used to watch this
Chad “Jo…..” Me “…. Mama?” Chad “mama.” Me *victory air punch*
Jojo and Olivia Rodrigo both suffer from the same problem, neither of them can swear to save their lives. They just sound like middle schoolers who just learned the word fuck and are still afraid to say it near their parents.
Jojo and Olivia Rodrigo both suffer from the same problem, neither of them can swear to save their lives.
This might be the first time I’ve ever seen an early life crisis
0:11 guys.. I think. I think something is wrong.. guys.. why does she sound like that?.. guys.. I’m so confused.. a loss of words..
Chad Chad I knew you were gonna make a Jo mama joke. Also JoJo Ciwa most defently did not create gay pop, she also has not done anthing for it. Chaple Roan and Carpetgarden are much better queer atists
Thank you for the dark, f'd up hamburger helper mascot reference. Made my day
Jojo is a perfect example when you grow up without a father to keep you grounded.  The woke money hungry mentally ill mother would have been stopped by a good father. Do we need to start monitoring women, to stop them from destroying children? Jojo is a gross, scarey, freak whose need for attention is matched only by her crazy mother
Don't wanna be weird but reeeeeally wanna know what foundation you use cos your skin is flawless girl ❤
HAHA I KNOW WHAT IS YOUR REAL NAME! YOUR NAME IS CHELSEA (i googled it lol) :3
I feel like i get that she wouldn't want people to view her as a child anymore, and wants to try to be unpredictable like this feels like this was one of those moments when you try to speak but then people tell you you're stupid and then you get nervous and you can't speak right and just confirm their theory of you being stupid if that makes any sense
I guess you could say she... came in like a wrecking ball? Yeah, it was Britney, b*tch. Etc etc. People really are clueless about this bs... It is always strange to be reminded how many different worlds there are in our world. Some absolutely unrelated. Hubris in flesh.
9:03 yesssss sdv
Guys, this is JoJo's bizarre adventure.
i thought the "bye" and the end screen was a bit and kept waiting for the actual ending. I'm still sitting here waiting to be thanked for clicking on this video out of ✋🏼AAALLLLLLLLLL✋🏼 the videos
9:03 that harvey comment is so real
She's like the villain from a mediocre mid 2000's Disney Channel kids musical
her cover of Bohemian Rhapsody is straight up disrespectful, idc what you say that shit is just her singing a random song with the borhap lyrics and it sounds horrible!!!!  and yeah Freddie Mercury said that "you can do anything you want with my art, just don't make me boring" (let's ignore he said that to his manager and that should only apply to Queen) but that's basically what he meant, this sound so lifeless and im sure he'd absolutely hate it
Too bad the end got cut...
Is she sick? does she need help?
I'm gonna be honest, until literally this video I've never heard of her or her music but that is like the most tame "safe for 13 year old's" stuff I've heard in years. And holy moly that dislike ratio 380k likes to 2.3 million dislikes. (on the music video)
jojo siwas edging era
Get on Miley Cyrus or Demi lovato level then we can talk JoJo
Fiddlesticks! OMG you are disgusting!!!
she’s going on side quests🩷
The thing that gets me is that usually when people sing about "Karma" it's about a specific person or group of people who wronged them, but this song doesn't seem to be about Abby-Lee Miller or her mother
i literally have that same shirt you have on
that voice
I onestly dont know my opinion on the stiuation
Daniel give me coffe
Watch her career fail, and then she becomes some kind of rightwing talking head.
yall can we talk about how she literally snatched that Abby Lee Miller energy and used it to traumatise her own dancers? LITERALLY GENERATIONAL TRAUMA. She doesn't need an emo phase she needs therapy
if jojo siwa wants to stop being a child star... she should going by jojo???? her name stage that brought her fame? change her hair colour, switch it up at least with your name goddamn
She probably means she was a bald girl 💀
This is sickening. I can no longer support you. I honestly don’t even know why you would post this. I think you real need to reevaluate your life. Why am I saying this? SHES A HARVEY FAN!! EWWWWWW
The only thing more morbidly amusing than Jojo's disconnect from reality is just how cartoonishly awful Jessalyn is, was, and will likely always be.
5:13  Melanie Martinez: Am I a joke to you?
As a JoJo, we don't claim her
4:33 WAS THAT CLUB PENGUIN GAME DAY MUSIC?
I love chad chad so much
Regarding the mv, I feel like Brit Smiths version was just more true to the song overall. I mean “thou shall not...” makes so much more sense in the context of a confession to a priest?
Give ur editor a raise. I DIED at the avatar jpeg’s 😂
"She's raspy today"
I don’t know what else to put here but I hope your knee feels better ^^
I'm still traumatized from Miley Cyrus's transition from child star. Jojo isn't even a blip on the radar
In the D.R.E.A.M music video, she wasted a perfectly good popcorn bucket by putting GLITTER in it 😢
when the music and video hit so bad Chad^2 didn't even do the classical ending
9:02 He's the number one second option,  nobody chooses him first
2:18 soooooo trueesee
I think the funniest part was the fact that she didn't even Write the song 💀
All record companies do this to young “musicians” if that’s what you want to call them. It’s a PR stunt and hers looks like it was done out of someone’s basement. Horrible. Wait a few years and she’ll be as sluty as Miley’s PR stunt was.
mc donalds
This is worse than the Cartoon Network reboots
You look so much like mia maples
i rewatch chad chads vids constantly and i literally just noticed the song bits removed now cause of jojo💀💀
Lol I remember when this video had your reaction to karma
JoJos bizarre adventure
THE DANCING SEQUENCE YOU DID MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD
Did anyone tell you you’re a natural born dancer
They should put Karma in JustDance 😂
Best sponsor segway ever
Im gonna be real. When I first heard of JoJo I saw her with that outfit and legit though it was a cosplay of a JoJo Bizarre Adventure  😂

when she tries coke
She made another one 😢
jojos bizarre era
9:44 what is the music
You can really tell she never went to public school...
the depression from dance moms hit her and hit her hard
"No one has made this dramatic of a change yet"......Literaly every kid that came out of Disney Channel did it before her.
5:21 joji did it.
The fact no one sees this is a marketing plan for socail media growth for a girl who was starting to lose fame
Chad Chad is legitimately funny ASF most of the time
I’m bummed Chad Chad had to edit out the dancing along to karma bit
Wasn’t this longer?
Girl new fan here and i am living for your content 😂😂😂😂😂
Never grew into that head, did she?
SOOOO REAL WITH THE HARVEY COMMENT 😮‍💨😮‍💨 9:03
SOOOO REAL WITH THE HARVEY COMMENT 😮‍💨😮‍💨
please do a video on dance moms
imagine getting this much media coverage... for a single song. she's got it like she has changed the world with 1 song. this is what happens when you're surrounded by ego boosting people. kinda feel bad for her as her mental has been irrevicably damaged.
you better put some respect on it. JoJo solved gay.
Jojo: nobody has ever done what I did at my level.   Miley Cyrus: welll.....
i just realized your entire reaction to the song is no longer in this video after re-watching it since it first came out. Well, you know what they say:  Copyright's a Bitch! You should've know better...
Everything about JoJo Siwa now just screams "I am confused". Child celebreties all end up getting messed up by the industry one way or another.
Man new subscriber here and damn dude those geek references just pulled me in… I just came for the tee at first 😅
She could've made some kind of ballad songs that are calm and slow maybe dark too, you know? the opposite of her previous brand.
2:48 George Michael, Freddie mercury, Elton John, David Bowie, boy George, lady gaga, Miley Cyrus, Chappell roan and Billie Eillish did not die for this 5:18 where’s Melanie 😡😡/hj     (Those are the two I can think of on the spot PLS GIVE ME MORE)
I am ashamed to say that Karma came out on my birthday :/
9:02 real bro 😔✊
honestly funny how she now got exposed for stealing multiple songs (buying the rights and saying she made them)
9:37 is the best
NAWH NOT THE ATLA REFERENCE 😭😭😭
omg did chad have to edit out her live karma reaction out of this video?? 😭😭 its not here anymore
I dont know much about jojo or this rebrand so for a bit i though she was going though an emo phase cuz she looked like shes in middle school, i was shocked to find out shes around 20
Monotone and sarcastic humor is as played out as Siwa’s bad girl stage
Jojo is cool because she is real she has always been real she does her things you have to do for advertisement money whatever but she's always lets in who she really is
i think jojo is on something tbh
Chad chad dancing...i..am Inlove with you!
I love how she says she is afraid of being a bad girl and saying f’d around. When literal kids are worse than her💀
My mom said “Jojo looks like a gay power ranger villian” oooop
i love how she aggressively calls JoJos mom the wrong name
Honestly I feel more concerned/bad for her than anything else. She basically got the t.v. celebrity kid treatment.
News flash: long as y'all keep talking about her? She gonna stay famous. WTF  there's like 500 videos about her. WTF
Luna Vachon wants her gimmick back
Do yall remember that one song from the 90's called " how bizzarre" thats real life today lol😂
Fun fact: Jojo Siwa is 21 years old if you didn’t it know (lol idk why I said this)
She's giving Princess Irmaplotz from Dave the barbarian
whats the metal song at 6:08 ?
That was some pretty good dancing, Chad Chad. I genuinely am impressed.
i liked her until the karma song and bashing the bible not a fan anymore
Aaahhhh😭😭😭🙌🙌🙌she knows JJBA
I’ll kiss a floor person. Also, i say dang too. I’m kinda a bad boy  Nbd
Este video es corto, gracioso, y explicativo. Me gusta eso.
*uses the skip function on my raycon to skip the raycon ad*
Guys stop making fun of JoJo it’s not her fault she got akumatized 😭😭😭
Is Jojo repping for monster energy?
Me: Mom, can we get the new KISS album. Mom: We have KISS at home. KISS at home:
Flashing lights you are a fucking move and I think you are hilarious. You have really insightful views and not only that you also keep up with very comedic timing like you were very insightful and I appreciate you. Sorry this is fucked up voice to text cause I’m lazy.
God dman copy right.
“no one has had this much of a change” does Melanie martinez even exist to you?? 🤨🤨
JoJo Siwa is a Gen Z clone of Chloë Grace Moretz on crack.
One time a kid in my school described Jojo siwa as a science experiment, and I now can't see her as anything else lmao
NOOO CHAD CHAD’S REACTION HAS BEEN OBLITERATED BY THE COPYRIGHT GODS 😭
Anyone notice that the video changed? Her reaction to JoJo's MV is gone and the video's shorter now. Cease and desist? Copyright issue?
Seems like she saw Miley Cyrus and thought to herself: I can do that too
My dad won’t stop doing the karma dance😭
when she comes out of the water it's litr "moto moto likes you"
I knew Chad Chad is the Avatar 😂
I watched it early and just watched it again, sorry you got copyright striked
I'm gonna be real: I feel like her mom had a massive say in this.
I give her a 10+ age-rating at most
the car rapping bit got me more than I’d like to admit
I know you were pushing Raycons but you really sold me on having green baseboards and doorframes
Am I the only one who feels very bad for her? She was under very high pressure since shes able to stand. Every little step of her was watched in television. OF COURSE she is behaving weird now. She has no clue how to be her own person.
27
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REACTION IN THE END WHY IS IT GONE????
Cannibals are the only humans if we are what we eat
me over here crying cause my ears are shaped like a seashell (no joke i litteraly cant fit a earbud in my ear its a like a slip-n-slide for them please send help immediately)
love the *extremely* subtle JBA reference
I can relate to stress cleaning more than anything jojo has ever said
4:44 BAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA THE BACKGROUND WITH  NEW JOJO IS EVERYTHING 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
The collage has me in tears 😂
you've made my life 100x better. i just want to hug you like a giant penis plushie.
11:51 Wasn't here a full video about you reacting to Karma? Did you get copyrighted??
JoJo's too young to know this, but we all thought Miley's party girl phase was cringe, too, lol. Any time there's an obvious switch from cutesy child star to sexually aware adult, it's a bit cringe.
As a French (i guess socialist compared to your criteria) ... how about NOT EXPLOITING KIDS? that could avoid these really awkward moments.
When somebody says JoJo, I never think about Jojo siwa. I think about JoJo's bizarre Adventure (:
That ad read has to be one of the best I've seen 🤣🤣 the baby's muffled crying
Wanting Harvey from Stardew Valley is so real.
I've never followed or heard much of or watched dance moms (looked like child abuse on television) so yes, I think of giant bows and very large forehead
I think all the jiggling is not good for the brain cells.
Im in love with chad chad
I enjoy having intercourse.
Her personality is like: 😜🌸🩷🍭 Her new persona is:☠️🖤😧👻⛓️🕷🏳‍🌈
9:18 TEAR IT UP!! GO WHITE GIRL GO!!
As a woman who likes women I'd like to say that we dont claim her
quick reminder to all that this edgy rebrand is supposed to mask her abuse of children with XOMG pop and her defense of groomers such as Colleen Ballinger <3
You can even see jojo at the red carpet turn to the photographers and say, "isn't what I'm wearing so edgy?! I'm so edgy and adult now guys!" I'm that 50 year old smokers voice. Best case, we find out this is ALL from the adults around her and she can somehow recover in like 5-8 years.
Damn woman get some furniture or a rug, it's so echo-y in your house
Yo when you mentioned dance moms you brought back some old ass memories of me thinking these moms are fucking awful when I was a kid
i thought you were kris!
COME AS A FISH 🤬🤬🤬🗣️🗣️🗣️❗️❗️😧
Omg the part with the pen*s plush is so funny
Jo Jo  looks like kiss omg too funny
NO CHA CHAD GOT COPPED FOR THE DANCE END SEQUENCE 😭😭😭
WAIT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DANCING
Remind me of weird Barbie
Why is she dressing like 2008 Jeff hardy?
Her not knowing Gene Simmons and wearing THAT
O my god, they seriously copyrighted the video? 🤦‍♀️
Nah we need to call Abby Lee for her again
This aint jojo's bizarre adventure, this is jojo's weird journey 🗿🗿🗿
more photos of chonky cat pls
I can back to rewatch this and I was so thrown off when I didn’t see Chad Chad watch karma. Really threw a wrench in my day:(
She over sold it 😅 someone like me who doesn’t follow this crap was a little surprised by her new image, but she dropped too many hints to the people that do follow her that they intended effect didn’t come off quite as strong.
Chad Chad covering Jo Jo is excellent!!! 👏👏👏😊❤
bruh there can only be jojos bizarre adventure wtf is this shit 😭
STARDEW VALLEY MENTIONED OMG
Child celebrities make me so sad
Side note, this woman wants Harvey's to out put her on their radar.
I've never heard about that girl in my life, but it seems like she vastly overestimates her talent, originality and overall importance.  She's very athletic though, I wish I was able to flip like that!!
the final dance and snippets of jo jo singing being cut is bc i can only assume that jojo copystruck chad. which if true is so pathetic lol
THE FIRE AND ROCK AND WATER AND TORNADO BRO IM CRYING YOUR EDITING IS SUPERIOOOROROROORORRO
Girl went from 🌈 to🏳️‍🌈
That sponsored section was one of the best I've ever seen hahah
That shirt is pretty sweet
:3
I feel like Jojo could of stayed as a child friendly artist. It wouldn’t be a bad thing and she could still be successful as a good role model for children.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO why was the final dance cut? :((((
I mean her dance isn’t a bad choreography, just when it’s not being performed by her cuz she makes it look like she a NY city crackhead tweaking out on the side of the street.
I wish she would stop doing that stomp dance… she does it like 40x a day, literally whenever she’s in front of a camera or person
10:16 IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
she didnt do the wave thing i stay to the end for 😢
How does she not know that she looks like a kiss member wannabe
I don't know. All of this commentary is giving "young women's interests should be mocked relentlessly so they never try to do anything on their own again" vibes. Is it cringe? Yeah, a bit. But that's kind of how all 21-year-olds are and this blowback is as out of proportion as people were about Twilight fans, and Miley Cyrus, and countless other things that people hate because of who likes them.  I just think everyone needs to ask themselves if they _want_ to crush JoJo Siwa's spirit. If no, maybe shut the f*ck up. If yes, then there's something broken in you and you might want to try therapy
It's almost like being a child-star is bad for one's mental health.
Id like to see her live reaction to death metal
Chadchad full dance video when? (love your vids btw)
i thought you were a feminist but here you are jumping onto the hate bandwagon against a young woman who did nothing wrong. youre a loser! unsubscribed and disappointed.
The Harvey statement is so real
Hawkmoth went too far
STOP THE EDITING WITH THE AVATAR ELEMENTS GOING OFF WHILE YOU DANCE LMFAOOOO ❤
Love that she's edgy but... 6:15  her car seat covers says EVERYTHING
I have a feeling she changed herself completely because she didn’t think that it would be cool to be a child icon forever and so she changed herself so she can be a more “cooler adult* when really I think she’s kinda childish. NO OFFENSE TO HER AND HER FANS THOUGH JUST A THEORY- 😅
I don’t know why kids stereotype that being grown is same as being bad lmao😅 but she’s TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD  lmfaoooo that’s like 10-15 year old phase😭😭😂
My step sisters went through that sadistic dance school, its former location is within walking distance of my home. It’s amazing anyone went through that nut bags school and turned out remotely normal.
and now a tribute to the lost chad Chad Karma cover, you will be missed
I am proud to say that I have learnt the karma dance and am prepared to traumatise my friends and sister with it💅
😂😂
10:00 “call an ambulance! But not for me 👹”
the jojo refence
jojo is the brie larson of gay people
NO! SHE JUST SAID FIDDLESTICKS!
Shes going to regret this in the future
11:39 Holy shit. This is the _cleanest_ thing I have _ever_ seen.
I see jojo claimed video as majority of scenes with heir video clip are removed 😅
Oh my goodness the Avatar bit had me cracking up 💀😂
Powerpuff Girls villain era
billie ellish has better gay pop
Gosh, and I was so worried about getting ear buds in case I dropped them in my armpit. 😥
Well... Rick James said it best "cocaine is a hell of a drug"
I dunno if it's because I'm 30 but she really looks like a child/early teen, not someone in her 20's making serious art. It's weird.
Can content youtuber just once come up with an original idea. Jojos rebrand really doesnt need five different videos from five different creators who all talk about the same shit. She dresses differently now, who the fuck cares?
I kind of feel bad for her. It sounds like her mom is a money-hungry psychopath just kind of using her (and anyone else she can) as a pawn, and regardless of her own level of investment she has to go along with it. "Stay relevant or your parents won't love you" is not a mindset kids should be subjected to, and I can't not see her as a kid.
Jojo should call that dance move freakin up the brain stem😅😂
Is she wearing a shirt with here face on it? What the hell?
i'm here for the fighting game moves.
everything about her fucks me off
The point is she’s implying being gay is being bad…
6:18 CHAD IS THAT FUNERAL FOG BY MAYHEM I HEAR?????
I kind of feel bad for Jojo. I mean, it’s not her fault she’s cringe. It just comes naturally to some people.
There’s a shaved head in her future.  This is main character syndrome in a poorly programmed game.
Jojo's voice is so raspy I wanna ask her to say "Do the roar"
Can you really wonder why she turned out like this? Look how she grew up. I think we should feel bad for her.
Shane Dawson the pedo?
Her quarter life crisis is unique.
America got knocked up by Edward Bernays and had an abortion and it's name is JoJo. Please stop all of this immediately. You're giving the game away. Oh,and don't put your dog in a cage. Wtf is wrong with you?
Siwa is absolutely insufferable.
9:38 reminded me of the avatar opening ngl
Chad Chad was so traumatized she couldn't even give her usual outro, I sit here for the end of every video, just to hear the "Thanks for clicking on my video out of alllllll the others" and I got nothing this time :') it must be jojo's fault
I can never understand why this idiot child became a thing in the first place. She's a complete non-entity.
I’m really worried about this young lady’s hairline.
I'm happy I don't know who the fuck this girl is.
Turned out i got a twinge of racism inside me. I thought jojo siwa was an african soccer player. Learn something new everyday
I am also a stress cleaner! 😅   Funny stuff, lady! Keep up the great work.
She was a cute kid with moderate talent in a small pool drawn only from parents willing to exploit their children. Now the cute is gone and the childish talent doesn't translate into the adult world. Her new look doesn't look real, it looks like the artificial look created for a character playing a "pop" idol in a D-list movie. Also she is a painful idiot. Parents who expose their children to the fashion/entertainment industries are f'ken scum.
This would have been way cooler if she just dropped Karma without any campaign, no posts, nothing. Just random.
Anyone noticed she has a cage for her dog... is that normal? I think only a pi*c* of sh*t of human being would do that.
For somebody to be training since 5 on dance and has absolutely no rhythm is crazy work
That new outfit looks like the photo negative of an old one.
I never liked Jojo. The way they branded her with that giant bow on her head was a death sentence. I always wondered what she’d look like as a grown woman with a giant bow on her head. Now I know and it’s worse than I ever imagined. She needs to stop.
It's funny that she grew up dancing, and never actually learned to dance. Her moves are sincerely horrible
easily one of the best videos on this topic, thanks for kinda going into how the rebrand is mostly a cover up for the xomg pop thing
I feel bad for Jojo because I know when she's older she's gonna look back at all this and cringe really hard lol
My knee hurts, too.  Weird.
To be fair, Jojo’s original content was like baby baby content. Disney channel shows are for young kids but also it was normal for teens to watch it. Jojo’s baby content was enjoyed by preschool-kindergarten girls. So I would agree with her it’s a more drastic change. It’s just she needs to stop talking about it because it takes away from anyone possibly taking her seriously 😂😅
no but like i can’t see jojo the same anymore 😭😭
Years from now, we'll find out which Hollywood weirdo harmed her.
Jojo Siwa: ”No one has ever made this dramatic of a change”   Melanie Martinez: 💀
Jojo is going through every 9 year olds idea of “edgy”
She stole that song from other people.
Bizzarevark was my child star 📸
Her costume looks like GoldDust but female
Looked like you tried doing the club penguin dance
Kiss + Dog The Bounty Hunter = jojo
I can’t be the only person that think she looks and acts exactly like Jake Paul
She reminds me of a girl version of Jake Paul... and i can't believe I am going to say this... but a little more cringey.
“Shoot,crap,fiddlesticks,gosh,darn,gee-whiz”  chad chad watch your language!!!11!1!!!😨😨😨😨😰😰😰😰😥😥😥😥🤢🤢 (This comment is a joke)
12:15 not gonna lie, this is the best version I've heard of this song. To be fair, the only other version I've heard is the original
If it had actually been a good song, we'd be talking about how great the marketing was.
Bach: Cello Suite No. 1; best
I'll say this for the rebrand - I know who JoJo Siwa is, now. I am not comfortable with this new knowledge.
Jojo saying how scared she was of the lyrics while being in the brightest cutesy pink room and then later singing Karma in her car with unicorn seats is so funny
The biggest issue I have with her is just how much "I'm gonna Change the World!" energy she gives off.
who has done an amazing rebrand? ive probably blocked it out
Hold on, cause as much as she doesn’t deserve my defense, can we really blame a 13 year old girl for having asbestos in a product that literally just has her face on it? If anything we can blame her managers, but I mean I doubt she even knows what it is let alone purposefully puts it in her products. I’m just saying
the bending sent me
Reminds me of when Miley
6:25 it was probs espresso by sabrina carpenter orrr viva la vida 👍
Everytime I see her I think of Amanda Bynes
I dont get how someone decides on a completely new look, but keeps that awful chav ponytail 😂
0:10 she looks drunk😭😭😭
FIRST OF THE GENERATION?
Ours is a very voyeuristic culture. We allow idotic people in various states of arrested development to be famous, all so we can watch them makes fools of themselves. Meanwhile, said idiots dont realize they're being court jesters for the whole world. South Park said it best, kids, "just because you have their attention doesn't mean you have their respect."
#THATSNOTMYJOJO
this is horribly off topic but hearing the tf2 ost in chad chad’s videos catches me so off guard and sends me to a different plain of existence that you can only reach by hearing the music from your favorite franchise
Ey Chad Chad👋 Im also "Ey Chad" 👈 (see wad I did derr) Technically I'm, Jason Chadwick "The Chad" Muska III Branded "THE CHAD" circa 1995 to 1998 ish   Long Story, but i don't actually know when or where I was born.
she reminds me of those "goth girl bullied because of her makeup" dhar mann videos  😭🙏🏼
does she know that karma has been released a thousand times before. also why is she a bad girl if she can’t even say fuck. 😭
So when are child stars going to just be outlawed? They rarely, if at all, turn out sane
What part of Jojo is this?
Who chooses Harvey over Sebastian?
"LOVE CHAD CHAD WITH MY LIFE"  -My friend when he realized Chad Chad also loves Harvey
I fuckin love your work mate!
5:17 Once again using Archimedes from hit game TF2 to portrait the pure insanity of Jojo’s brain
I never thought I’d say this… but thank god I didn’t have internet access in middle school.
I don’t think she’s ever been given a real opportunity to discover herself. That fucking sucks :/
JoJo's "rebranding" is more of a "debranding" really
why is it when girls wanna be edgy they just commit acts of lesbianism 😭
2:56 made me shiver uncomfortably
First of all, as a damn near 50 year old GRANDMA, this is pure sh!+
The painted on goatie beard lol
The entire point of JoJo was to be a gay pied piper leading 6-9yos into the degenerate world of the Woke Rainbow Cult Mafia.  And now she’s just a lesbian trope.
did she get tattoos
Miley ran so Jojo could do... whatever this is. Crawl maybe?
Jo Jo might be having a midlife crises LOL 😂😂😂
She needs a hug 😂
she's going full Miley Cyrus
watching jojo dance has been some of the funniest sh!t I've ever seen!😆😆😆😆  Watching her try to dance 'harder' than everyone else is beyond cringe!!  It seems to me like she's trying to give herself a concussion or at the very least whiplash just so she can boast that she's so committed to this supposed 'rebrand'🤣🤣🤣  If she really wanted to shock everyone, she should just become an adult film star, or start an onlyfools acct😆😆
I dislike Jojo, but I like your video. Fine, I’ll sub. 💜
My jump from child jazz dancer and spellingbee champ to heroin addict was the biggest jump of my generation, i would say.  Move over JoJo
HARVEY MY HUBBY
Kia’s are easy to steal, someone should steal her wrapped Kia in a video game
Probably drugs it always ends up being drugs always every single time
Holy hell this channel used to be kinda funny now it's hard to even stay awake during a video.
Lmfaaaaaaaaaaooooo geee wiz
Jojo is a clown
2:10 ... I'm still confused as to why there was a disclaimer. There was none of those things except flashing lights
I understand this is a hilarious spectacle but please pay some attention to the young girls that she treated just as shitty if not worse than she was treated on dance moms
Tf2 music
Who didn’t see this coming
Jojo siwa is the female jake paul
Ugh... I cringed soooo much 😂😭
Joe siwa
Joe siwa
Joe siwa
I legit thought jojo siwa was a Jojo's reference.
She could just milk younger audience further, I don't think she knows what to be an adult actually means.
Love you chad but I'm gonna put your references when talking about JoJo saying "no ones made this big of a jump" to shame.... Did everyone forget Disney's baby and golden child Hannah Montana herself... naked on a wrecking ball?
shes turned into a joke and meme, she was a sweet kid whos turned into a little crack head little monster and whos embarrassing herself
Chad Chad I love you... But never violate my eyes with your dancing.
She is so cringe.
THE LOOK HE GAVE HER AT 5:24 😭
They call this edgy? 🤣
Well Miley Cyrus turned the song down. Brit smith originally recorded the song. She couldn’t do anything original if it but her in the face.
13:17 Appreciate that Cody ko & Noel Miller sound effect, perfectly used
You know Chad Chad is scared when she doesn't do an outro...
She just hit the Emo phase late.
THE VIDEO IS NOTHING NEW...WE HAVE SEEN THE ' GAY LOVE ' ACT MILLIONS OF TIMES. MADONA WAS THE FIRST TO REALLY 'COME OUT' ON THIS 'ACT'. JJO IS JUST  FOLLOWING THE KLEADRS'. SHE HAS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER. ALL RE-HASHED . EVEB THE ' KARMA' SONG WAS DONE BY 'BRIT SMITH ' 13 YEARS AGO ON HER ALBUM. NOW 'SHE' IS COMING BACK TO FINISH AND PRODUCE 'HER' MUSIC THANKS TO JOJO ...
YES. SHE IS REALLY A SAD EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE TRYING TO BE ACCEPTED INTO TODAYS GROUP OF COOL PEOPLKE.. # INGAYTOO MOVEMENT...ACCEPT ME OR ELSE...THIS HAS 'NOT' WORKED OFR HER.  HER ' KISS' ERA MAKE-UP AND WEIRD DANCING HAS REALLY JUST SHOWN US ALL HOW DESPERATE SHE IS TO BE EXCEPTED AS AN ADULT AND RELEVENT IN TODAYS ERA OF ' WEIRD'.
this is my fav Chad Chad video
Jojos bizzare edgy phase
7:59 I just realized that's her face on her top 💀
chad chad maxed her out her cringe limit that she forgot her iconic outro lol
Who?
jojo's dance moves kinda remind me of people trying to put on skin tight leggings after getting out of a pool
Anyone remember when Miley Cirus went through the same, literally was a huge meme?  Or Justin Bibers acting out. This is kinda normal for kids who lived their childhood in crazy fame like they did.   Normal for teenagers/young adults. Trying to find themselves. These kids just have more money and all the focus on them. Which is unhealthy on it's own already.   They are normal teens. Being in their edgy era. Funny af but still normal and something most of us went through. Just on a lesser degree or less intense at least.
Her "rebrand" wasnt born from the need to be taken seriously, it was something she always wanted to do and have been thinking about for at least 5 years. She hasn't changed, which is why it feels so forced.
your dog is so silly goofy
She gaaaayyyyyyy
Seems to have worked, can’t even figure out what she use to do and I went out of my way to try to figure it out
She's joining Kiss
BROOOO the dog screaming had me spitting my drink lmaoo
Pg 13 rebelion/ Disney teenagers. That is what they are going for. Unfortunately for everyone they are doing it IRL. They should have chosen the Hallmark Romance. That would have been mildly more successful since apparently shouting and exaltation is a must do. Nonetheless, prepare for the period after this one. Jojo's mother... 😱😢
If Sam Smith tried it and failed miserable...what makes her think she'll pull it off?
jojo looks like an enemy stand user 😭
It 100% seems like shes finally able to go through a phase shes wanted to go through for her entire teen yaars
HAPPY 69TH VIDEO CHAD CHAD
I love all of the jojos bizarre adventure references
Jojo's bizarre "it's not a phase, mom" song.  Also, your hair in the earbud plug looks gorgeous.
Damn, what they did to that group member with a chronic condition is beyond f---d up. Wow.
The music video is aggressively disney channel...
Why does jojo have like the worst voice to exist, I can't bare it and who said let's get this onto a track
12hr rehearsals are actually very common in the dance industry, but typically those are rehearsals for the few days leading up to 2-3 HOUR long SHOW , NOT a single song 😭
Is that a Jojo (Siwa) reference⁉️⁉️⁉️
The fact that she didn’t even write the song….
This is what happens when you give a tad too much positive encouragement to kids.
She’s gross
Shes following the same steps many child sngers have. Brittany. All nic and pure fo years. Groomed to be a sexy girl by the time she was 15 by her handlers. Then in her 20s lost her mind. Christina Aguilera same thing. But she didn't lose her shit as bad as Brittany. Jessica Simpson same thing. She's still not recovered after her divorce with nick lachey. She bounces from man to many almost as bad as swift. Now we have little JoJo. Groomed from day one of her television appearance. Now her voice is trash her hair is falling out in patches she turned Lebanese, oh I meant lesbian😏. I wonder if she's gonna win next years kids choice awards for Nickelodeon? that girl Now she done lost her mind. And to top it off the animator meat canyon did a video about her. That shit is hilarious. So yeah little girls and Hollywood don't mix because lecherous Hollywood men can't wait for them to be young ladies and try to make them the perfect soon to be freak on the block ready for those lecherous men.
i like this chad chad person. i laughed occasionally. pls dont mess up. thanks
"I kissed a person of a same gender, so i guess u could say im a bit of a.... bad girl"
God she- JoJo reminds me of that incoherent feral character on Nickelodeans The Wild Thornberries
I don’t want to defend her for a million reasons including her support for Colleen, but as a woman her age I kind of feel bad for her situation (again not for her specifically). Her upbringing was so incredibly abnormal and controlled by her mother. Her ego is inflated for the same reason, more or less. She’s trying so hard to be ‘normally abnormal’ but flopping so hard because she doesn’t understand what segment of the market she’s actually trying to cater to. Her struggles have all been engineered…they’re not real like mine and yours. Yes, dance moms was a horrific environment, but to what extent was it for content? Someone get this girl a good therapist, a group of REAL friends and a frat basement NOW
Why does it look like she’s in the kiss band
Why does it look like she has a Confucius beard
11:28 I have a penis plushie just like that but smaller. His name is Lil Dickie. 😂
Can't teens just do drugs anymore?
"Nobody has made this dramatic of a change" Gurl Melanie Martinez became a fairy bffr
I love the 2010 dubstep dance, the lack in knowledge of glamrock influence and how out of touch her management is.   Try for Billie, not Dee Snyder
I have only been watching you for 4 min and you have made me laugh probably the whole time! Chad Chad is funny funny
I need to look into this Kiss group—they look pretty cool
JoJo's voice cracks 😭
She's 20? I thought she's like 15, and was gonna say whatever she is a child and probably thinks this is actually edgy but nevermind.
I'm not on social media and honestly didn't catch the Jojo Siwa hype either, so I have to ask: what's with the witch hunt for this girl? Correct me if I don't know something, but from what I understand, it's clearly her mom who should get her brain tested. Why isn't she also seen as a psychological victim of her mother and a society that allows children and teenagers to be exploited in this way? I'm serious: please tell me what I'm missing here... I don't understand.
Gives of miley cyrus energy
Omg, the cringe is so intense
She literally sounds like my fucking grandma and my grandmas like 70 bro this bitch got the vocal cords of smoker/Old person even tho shes like 17🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
9:46 now i know where the avatar is!
It's like Xomg was a repeat of Dance Mom's, and it really makes sense.
ROFL the fact that all these people are talking about her kinda makes me think shes getting the attention she was going for. I really didnt know who she ways, but now I do. Thanks???
Can we stop calling marketing windows ‘era’s’ yet?
WHY IS ARCHIMEDES PLAYING TF2 MENTIONED RAAAAAAAAAHHH🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The fiddlesticks 😂
Jojo's new raspy voice sounds like Perry Caravello and her new dance looks like she's Lindsey Bluth's real daughter calling someone a chicken
This is genuinely so embarrassing like how do you do this and not cringe yourself to sleep every night. girl stop its almost kinda not to late.
The choreography looks like she's fighting off a swarm of bees!
Petition to see chad chad do just dance
Poser. Thats the word.
Jojo literally look like obstagoon/kiss hybrid lmao
She looks like she's attending WWE
I watched this video for 12 hours straight
prolly watched lords of chaos and tried to do the same face make up
The editing is peak brainrot
Why would a lesbian want a giant stuffed dick thingy?
As one woman to another, can I just say I have a big girl crush on Chad Chad? She chads my life up!
Masturbate your brain and enjoy ideas
can we talk about the fact that jojo stole the whole entire song from a different artist
No one ever went from Disney Child to Pat McAfee this fast, she is the first
im amazed at how many channels there are that are exactly like this..
She looks like the 3rd member of the legion of doom from the old WWF.
At least she revived the original artists career.. the girl who originally sang it like 10 years ago didn’t get any success because her label made her release a different song.
"I have 2 sides"  Child jojo  and  KARMAS A BITCH I SHOULDA KNOWN BETTER IF I HAD A WISH I WOULDA NEVER EFFED AROU-
"no one has had that dramatic of a change" cof Melanie Martinez cof
If she didnt talk about it i feel it wouldve had the reaction she wanted
7:02  LITERALLY “CAR RAPPING “ 💀
9:16 Literal professionals don't even rehearse for 12 hours. Because that's how you end up with irreversible damage to your vocal cords and literally any other damage caused by dance. Hopefully nobody got injured.
Am i tweaking or are you playing archimedes in the background
Jojo is so michael scott
You haven't missed anything, she was a kid. With a speech impediment. She's a hollow shell with no self worth following trends or anything else she can because it's what you do now.
Thats Jojo seizure yall
Listening to Jojo talk physically hurts me, like girl your voice 😭 PLEASE get a vocal coach you're eviscerating your vocal cords
her facepaint makes her look like a cracked egg
Why does Jojo Siwa voice sound so raspy and not in a good way
youre really fking funny
Just found out about who this even is today. I'm confident that this one is not going to rise anywhere near the past former Disney/Nickelodeon ish child stars turned sexy artists. This girl is...a little stubby puddle of vomit, cheesy, horrifically lame, embarrassingly dorky and just...I almost feel bad for how sad this is. I mean honestly, if she'd come out with just a straight sex tape accompanying a truly shitty yet raunnchy song, she'd be much more on track to achieving what she's going for
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure ❎ Jojo's Bizarre✅
whats the song that plays at 4:55 from
My sides 😂😂😂
More youtubers should do copywrite free music I loved that part lmao
I’m not sorry that music video was awful💀💀
Her costume reminds me of like wrestlers yeah wrestler costume
Literally, I haven’t even listened to the song or anything just clips and the video as well clips it genuinely sounds like she went from seven-year-old to very sheltered, barely tween jump like that’s what it sounds like. She’s being ridiculous. It’s stupid as fuck pisses me off.
Araki needs to include a stand or character inspired by jojo siwa. Or even a JOJO siwa. Then jojo siwa will be watered down to a jojo reference, her whole existence being dissolved.
the “EWWW WTFFF” was exactly my reaction lol 😂
0:35 it's saying _a lot_ about her brand when in this day and age there is asbestos in her makeup.
JoJo did not interest me before this video, still doesn't interest me at all, but dang am I glad I watched this video.
Haha, i much preferred your version of the song 😂
does chad chad have a gaming channel? please chad chad if u dont invest in one .. for me❤
this is terrible. the video is great, but the subject matter, fuuuck man.
Best youtuber. Look at this humour.
“Where was the humping?? I wanna see humping!” 😂😂
I thought it was Jake Paul
She says of her generation which doesn't include demi and Miley Cyrus but it does include (like you said)  -Olivia Rodrigo -Dove Cameron -Sabrina Carpenter -Rowan Blanchard  -Jenna Ortega (I would argue)
My biggest issue is how many young young lesbians look up to her. She has said she doesn't want to be called a lesbian because it's "too sexual." Which she is free to think but when you are a public figure with mostly child fans you should try to reflect on why you feel that way and what saying that will mean. She also claims she invented gay pop. Her complete disrespect of lesbian history and community is horrible.   If any young gay women are reading this.. lesbian isn't a sexual word, it is a word that connects you to decades of history and community. Don't change your words for yourself because people have decided it's sexual.
Chad Chad smooching on Stardew Harvey isn't a topic in the comments section and that's alarming to me. Was I meant to know this? 😭😂
It's kinda sad, cause I don't think she knows who she Is. She's been forced to cultivate this innocent image her entire life and I can see she's tired of it, but this isn't the way to do all that.
if her mom bqsically dressed her up like that (the rebrand, I mean), I think it's quite emblematic ofher mom not really acknowledging her as a person that she apparently did not show and explain fthe band kiss to her. I'm infantilizing her,but that seems appropriate given how obviously emotionally stunted she is. I think I have very similarly heard one complaint very similarly from several former child stars, which seems to especially apply to jojo - that through their childhood into adulthood they had hardly any sense of self, because they only learned to perfom, and hardly spent time living like normal kids.    also big yikes on the video featuring a yacht. 😬
While yall are debating the legitamcy of her rebrand and "badness"...My question is who messed with Jojo and turned her out in the first place? Was it Abby??? I mean forcing a dancer to dance through a spinal injury seems very Abbyish to me 🤔 When are we going to see the sickos come to justice for screwing with these kids..this is so repetitive 90% of child stars and yet noone is behind bars..when are these companies like Disney ever getting canceled
Oh Chad, sorry you’re just not jerky enough with your dance moves. You might have to practice some more
jojo gives me Ellen Degenerous vibes somehow. does this make sense??
Chad Chad is a confirmed Harvey enjoyer, she has clearly never known the supremacy of team Krobus     Real ones collect all the spouses like Pokémon cards
Am I allowed to think that Chad Chad is pretty? Or is that demeaning and reductive?
Quarter life crisis
The fact that such superficial and vapid 'my kid is going to be famous' crap can actually result in some level of fame is just one more detail about the modern world to be uncomfortable with.
Chad was the avatar for a moment. When Jojo needed her the most Chad vanished, leaving Jojo to become the bad girl she was marketed to be.
11:24 THAT'S LITERALLY A TAYLOR SWIFT LYRIC BUT SOMEHOW LESS EDGY
i think she didn’t have a real childhood so now she’s entering her teenage phases late. that’s the simplest explanation
Damn I totally thought my kid had just woken up
Why’s your camera looked so washed?
she really is supernaturally cringey, it's impressive
You made the fever dream of "the new jojo" hilarious and palatable ❤😂
Your like button just glowed now am scared😨am i drunk streaming again🙆
No fucking way she is dressed like that and doesn't know who Gene Simmons is
Jojo is in her gacha emo dark side evil luna clan era
This Chad guy’s pretty solid
Love how no one is mentioning the reason she started all this,  bc of the allegations of child abuse she involved in along with the other adults.
we met jojo on her bizzare adventure
"No one has done this before"  Melanie Martinez: 😐
Karma's a btch JoJo, you should have known better.
Girlie cannot give up the rhinestones😭
2:14  damn right traumatic😭😭
Bet girl drunk once and was like "im edgy🤓☝" 😭😭
her brand is still the exact same. loud, childish, obvious. this “emo” phase is her in a sparkly loud costume - essentially what a little girl would imagine an edgy teen is like
Youre hilarious 😂
What is this editing
When i was 18 i wondered why the old people refused to take me seriously even though i was now an official adult, catagorised by my government.... Now im 30 and i refuse to take anyone under 30 seriously 🤷
Dusty Springfield, Jackie Shane, The Pet Shop Boys, Queen, Elton John, Liberace, Indigo Girls, Melissa Etheridge, k.d. lang, Rough Trade, Melissa Ferrick...Just a few of the gay acts that came ages before Jo Jo. Nothing new, kiddo, and your "bad girl" image has absolutely nothing on Carole Pope.
jojos a poser
her whole branding is about being gay why would she get out of the store with a dick plush💀
Jojo Siwa's new style, make it look like she's secretly WAYYY too in to Gene Simmons, and can't admit it publically.
I guess edgy means only black and silver rhinestones lmao  On a real note this whole thing has been kind of baffling. She either doesn't have anyone giving her constructive feedback, or she's just enough of a narcissist that she's not listening. Like why lie about writing the lyrics? Why dance so aggressively (I know damn well that poor choreographer didn't tell her to do that)? Why wrap your car MULTIPLE TIMES with your own face?? AND I heard that she performed recently and still sang some of her old songs... like, she has two separate Spotify profiles now but she's still performing her kiddie music alongside the new shit? I just don't understand.  Edited to add: It's definitely like a 5 year olds idea of a bad girl. I think Jojo needs some friends her own age
The part where you're dance-bending all the elements effing killed me 💀
I love ur dino plushie! I also have one just that size :3
2:54 "I wanna start a new genre" * proceeds to name a slew of artists and songs already in the genre *
7:11 omg it's my best friend red sports car transparent background png whom I've used in many a power point presentation.
That actor Jojo humped in the video is a victim.
someone under her song commented „she looks like an energy drink“ lmaoo help
This was a fun vídeo
She looks like a pro wrestler, which is cool
The problem is that she has only ever been aware of what’s occurred during HER lifetime and she’s so sealed in that bubble that she’s believed all the hype that her mum and her PR team have told her. “I’m a pioneer? Noones done this before? For real? Let’s run with it!”
JoJo Siwa newest member of GWAR confirmed
jojo siwas cringe era
Omg is that kiss’s sister?! 😰😨😱
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE CAR RAPPING😭
There's nothing as funny as watching idiot spoiled celebrity with no self awareness making complete ass out of themselves
Jo Jo looks like an underdeveloped young boy man teen 😖
OMFG! That dog “yawn scream” got me.  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can’t IMAGINE wearing a shirt w my own face on it. 🤯
I feel bad for JoJo. She's just living the life her mother planned for and orchestrates for her. Plus, she's in that group of "24 and under" aka "cringe and obnoxious." People like JoJo Circus and Millie Bobby Brown can't help that they're annoying yet. Their age dictates that they have to be cringe
She got acumotised 😭😭😭😭
reminded me of me on drugs
Jojo should have just done a nude scene in a coming out movie, that probably would have worked better.
She became the avatar at 9:45
The music from Undertale to TF2 to the sound effects also from video games are the icing on the cake!
The humping literally put me into a coma
Selena Gomez literally went from Stars Dance to Revival with her naked body as the cover like Jojo did literally nothing
All nations where at peace, until the fire nation attacked.
Who is this for? Strictly from a business perspective, who is her target audience? It doesn't seem to be young kids anymore but teenagers would probably think this is cringe. 20 somethings are definitely not fucking with it. I don't understand who this is for!
her childhood dance moms trauma came back like a boomerang
she’s never had a break, people preach for the protection of children when the Population as a whole has done nothing but bully and make fun of her? Jojo is out here hustling, respect to that, she is an adult she can do whatever🤘🏼that song she could’ve bought the copyright for, so technically she didn’t steal anything, people are just too much 😂
Nobody tell Jojo about Ashnikko. She couldn't handle it
She is so self absorbed, cringy and out of touch
The fact that she was bending and called it dancing
Maybe she should should not have been abused her whole life.
lol "I'm getting better" xD you should've been one of her backup dancers
the medic music caught me so off guard i thought i left a tf2 video playing in another tab lol
Only thing edgy anout her new look is her chin.
I wonder if you'd be funny doing stand up?
5:22 Melanie Martinez literally went from a sweet looking girl to a pink fairy that has 4 eyes 😭😭😭
also she literally copied the song it’s not even hers and the original lowkey sounds better in my opinion
Hawk Moth was busy by the looks of it
"Gee wizz!"
I never liked JoJo Siwa, but my youngest sister was a huge fan of her and now her favorite celebrity is… this… and I just feel bad
So is this an 'emo' phases for this gen or something??
9:30 why the dancing😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
ima sorry but I listen to karma by Jojo Siwa most everyday and do the dance in front of my friends when ever they sad
I think her boomerang didn’t come back in time..
Anyone who says gaga and Miley invented gay pop has clearly never heard of pink…😂
Jojo has an amazing voice but her songs and personality are- uhm.. ye
Is this gonna be what ryan from ryan’s workd will turn into when he grows up?
She is weird tho, like she transitioned to a lollipop girl to  coral emo girl 😂
0:48  “She usually sings and dances in a the fashion I can only describe as… a *human glow stick.* “   DON’T YOU DARE DISRESPECT WILL LIKE THAT
I think she tried to went more on the way Rock and Metal bands went, with the face painting and colors, remind me a lot of Kiss, but it just didnt fit at all, the music dont match the aesthetics
Come on leave her alone lol this is kinda bullying jojo at this point. Did she do anything morally wrong? She’s just gay and growing up and sharing those important stages in her life. Of course things like that are cringe, but blasting her for being eccentric just rubs me the wrong way /:
JOJO'S REFERENCE 10:24
2 words: JOJOS CIRCUS 🤡
She feels she’s unpredictable because she hasn’t really been around people her own age/the market she’s changing to
What i gathered from this is that shes not a bad girl, just a terrible person
That avatar TLA rendition of the dance was so accurate 😂
jojo looks like a missing wwe star
She sounds like she was born in a house fire.
me: *watching this video as a way to force myself into taking a break from kissing and smooching Sebastian in Stardew Valley*  Chad Chad: *talking about kissing and smooching Harvey for 12 hours straight in Stardew Valley*  me: *tearing up* finally… a safe space
Not jojo  referencing Taylor swift at 11:22💀💀
She actually looks like enemy stand user from JoJo Bizarre Adventure, want to see her vs Jolyne Billie Eilish
12:55  she looks like me trying to play just dance 💀
thank you for your service 🫡
If Try Hard was a person…
fun fact the song is stolen
I feel bad for you listening to the song
Bro became the avatar😂 Earth Fire Water Air😂
jojo siwa acts like the gen z people before her has no idea what an emo phase is. if that aint sheltered idk what it is
😨
Wow, I didn’t know gay pop is a thing.
12:19 chad is so cute
Gay pop already exists.. Stray Kids 🏳️‍🌈
2 edgee 4 moo.
i like when he talks about planes
10:27 Wait, is this a jojo reference!?
There goes my childhood
She looks ridiculous.
12:22 i laughed WAY too hard at the dog edit 😂
you´re a Harvey girl?????
JoJo acts like someone who never got the chance to be a kid and her quirks has been magnified under a microscope for a bunch of judgmental losers with no life on the internet
as an emo, jojo we do not accept you please go back to singing about candy shops, boomerangs, and stop humping the air 😍
I think araki should add siwa in the new part cause look at her... Literally looks like a jjba character 😭
ABSOLUTELY NO HATE- But the thumbnail looked like an off brand kallmekris
“no one has had this big of a jump” harry potter going from an innocent kid you yelling the n-word:😐
jojo looks like a fortnite skin bruh😂
She looks like she just discovered Black Metal and decided to make it her whole personality.
Smartest way to not get copyright claimee. Sounded better than the actual song💀
The boomerang did not come back 😢
STARDEW VALLEY MENTIONED yessss
Not that I was going to watch her music video, but seeing it here was very yikes 😬
>>>> the LEFT NEVER disappoints....... they are the Most Intolerant HATERS. and ..BULLIES......... this is Exactly what the alphabet people have been going for .... SHE IS THE PRODUCT OF YOUR AGENDA <<<<<<
This change just made her more childish in a scary way
Are you gonna give the earbuds to Laura?
Chad gaining 2+ Million subs in 3 years is so impressive. Well done. Genuinely, you're doing a great job.
Don't worry, every teen has their own cringy edgy goth phase... Except she's an adult... (._. )
Jojo is on her bizarre adventure😂
Your'e dancing is too much..... I'm making it very obvious I'm watching YT at work... 😂😂😂😂
Jojo is the type of person who thinks wearing black nail polish means you are goth 😂
she literally just lowered the saturation bffr
Not excusing JoJo or her mom, I am curious why that child was even trying to dance with having such risky and severe surgery recently. That's madness
1700s pilgrims describing demonic possession:
Araki could add Jojo Siwa to JJBA and no one would know
I miss the original fancy sounding intro “A Twinge of Cringe”
If ur a bad gurl go to dog training and learn how to sit
She was weird as hell before and so why are we now shocked 🤔
Every one is talking about how she didn't write karma but no one is talking about how it wasn't even her singing on one of the songs she teased 😅
deeply appreciate the doctor harvey stan representation 🙏
ao3 writers are more extreme than this rebrand
Qhen she said when ever you like it or not the like button turned rainbow
It's funny at 12:58 when you accidentally say "messed around" instead of "effed" becsuse those are the original lyrics by brit smith.
I watched jojos music vid while tripping balls i was terrified
I like the new jojo. She can join the blunt rotation fs
I can't stand people who are up on 10 EVERY MINUTE of the day. Which she is. It's borderline obnoxious is what it is. And why is it this entire generation so narcissistic.
Yo that intro got me 😂
I'm sorry she's stealing everything from different people 1st it was a song from I don't know who but it was a song from different person 3rd of all she stole it from Taylor swift now now Jojo go up to Taylor swift and say I stole your stuff ha ha ha ha ha
I was a bad girl:👿 I WaS A baGeL:🥯
she didn’t even write the song...
i used to love jojo bt dang girl it wasnt that mch of a rebrand
She’s either delusional or being fake delusional for views lol
Poor girl... no one can be more invested in doing something silly and stupid than a teenager EDIT: me discovering she's almost 21 💀
her makeup is like if an sparkly goth drag queen suddenly lost all their skills after a lobotomy. (this is not an insult to drag queens, drag queens slay so hard and have makeup skills i could only wish for)
WHY SHE BE LOOKIN LIKE THE MAIN VILLAN FROM GREMLINS 💀
I’m scared
I’m 99.9% convinced she’s trying to star in Descendants 8 or however many of those they’ve made already 💀
she released it on my birthday. i guess it’s just my fault *i sigh, and my big blue orbs look down at my petite feet*
She went from Twitter to x
How can u still be hot in a freaking deer camouflage shirt
I was a bagel, I do a bag thing
Gay pop like people like king princess or hayley kiyoko dont exist 😭😭
She looks like wwe era rhonda Rousey's daughter
i like you, you’re cool
That tight ahh ponytail damaged her brain.😭
10/10  …… now back to reddit 🎉
9:47 is this a modern ways to summon element 🤣🤣
Bro is possessed
Yo stand up what the heck. Also you rule
Jojo just seems so full of herself honestly… she seems to think the world revolves around her, like “no one in my generation has made this big of a switch” and “I’m gonna invent gay pop” no 😊
after watching the music clip in ur video I automatically wanted to dislike the video, than I realized its not the music video
My 4th grade students, who were huge fans of Jojo Siwa since they were in Kindergarten, feel betrayed and don’t like her new persona. It was a career-killer move because she was a children’s entertainer and she was the only one in that market. She is not as a great singer as Christina Aguilera and not a great dancer line Britney. She was great as a children’s entertainer and she had no competition. Who else? The Wiggles?? She could have continued as a children’s entertainer.
CHAD CHAD COVERING JOJO SIWA IS A DREAM COME TRUE🥹
I think I found my new favorite YouTuber 😂. You are really funny and the editing was awesome!
Harvey is the best in Stardew Valley… I agree.
Bitch you don’t use those damn Raycons 😂😂😂
“No ones even questioned the music video yet” GIRL just because you’re getting really close to other girls doesn’t mean you’re really out here doing something. It was so lame.
JOJO, HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING??
You know when JoJo Siaw was a "glow stick" I thought she was awful but now since she is sorta emo..... I wanna go back tbh this fr is not worth watching after i watched it I suddenly wanted to put oil in my eyes and light it on fire.
JoJo is just 20 year old Fortune Feimster.
Her music may be extremely cringey but I feel kinda bad for her. She just seems like she's excited about life. It's like watching a child try to be edgy and just giving them a smile and a thumbs up in the background being like 'yes honey you're doing great' even though they look so dumb doing their thing.
Jojo's the kind of person to put pickle juice in her smoothies.
Ur funny
Jojo's joke era!
It's like she's trying to do what Poppy did, except Poppy is several leagues more badass when she became a Metal Queen.
09:10 I visited Berklee when I was in high school and the tour guide gushed about having gone to a masterclass held by one of Beyonce's backup dancers. he described how Beyonce worked so hard, she'd go to hours of rehearsal, fly to the UK to attend the Brit Awards, fly back, and resume rehearsals with her team. and all I could think about was the team, who had continued to rehearse basically the whole time she was gone
Theres never a smooth transition from “child star” to “copy paste artist”.
I always considered Jojo Siwa as “mid,” but this is a new low… much yikes. 🫤
She looks like she's trying to be on WWE. 😅
Whys is there a rolling black bar on  the screen
i usually get bored quickly of cutaway humor but you are absolutely hilarious! i cracked up so many times watching this!
So I’m a content marketer and… no. Just no. This is the worst campaign of all time, by far.
Her life is like a fever nightmare. Just. No.
Yes but also I want her confidence
wait why does she has a pp plushie? i thought she was gay? i also don't know if im joking or not
3:34 “ Todayss SpOnsowrr” I love it
😮😢
This is dance mom behavior to be fair
NEWEST KISS MEMBER ⁉️
idk maybe let her mind her own business, doesn't seems too problematic. Must stink to grow up as a child actor
NOOO I HAVE THAT DINO PLUSHIEEEEE😭 11:32
TBH, she’s the exact same just with black colors.😅
On a serious note, like her management made her be an annoying child all the way into adulthood to rake in dollars from little girls. Then she became a money hungry scammer herself. Like the mental issues she is probably going through.  We can use Miley S as an example. She said she did all the stupid controversial crap to get Disney to release her from her contract and leave her the fk alone. She was done with the kid stuff and she had to do whatever it took to get away from them.   Image who these people would actually be if this industry wasn’t designed to break, enslave and use and abuse kids.  Britney Spears, Linsey Lohan, Justin Bieber, Amanda Bynes, and literal thousands of these kid celebrity’s were abused and used all the way into adulthood and became so lost and damaged.   Drew Barrymore spoke up about the abuse and giving drugs and alcohol to her as a child and being dropped off at adult parties calling grown men her friends when she was 9. And now she’s protecting these mf and talking about she was in the wrong and wild and etc. she is protecting these mf because she gave into the Oprah cult and she chooses money and fame over exposing what Hollywood did to her.   Nickelodeon scandal coming to light.   I don’t laugh at JoJo I worry for her
Bro my cat is also named bones she is a good kitty
Ngl the new fit scares me fr
The humping was so violently unnecessary
@7:35 I just realized that this is Richy Jackson who used to dance and choreograph for Lady Gaga. That's a hell of a downgrade...
Why would parents raise their children like a Jojo if they were going to end up like Jojo
Im officially traumatized from seeing a sped up music video of hers- 😅💀 not the humping- 😭😭😭😭
excuse me maam, please stop being so pretty.
This is just sad what she did to those poor kids, to be fair she is kinda insane but this was a fun watch I found it hilarious 😂
5:26 FR WITH OLIVIA RODRIGO IM DYING 😭
Not the element bending edit lmao
dude i cant believe you learned ALL five kinds of fucking bending in this video bro. earth water air fire and spine
Lol all I can think is Sarah Lynn from Bojack
Chad chad is the female version of nakey jakey fr lol
You nailed that JoJo Dance,at first i thought it was a medical condition issue you had,but no."you got the moves".........Bless Up......🤙
Deadass, wtf is wrong with Jojo
Absolutely insufferable
It’s giving Disney Descendants villain cosplay or Generic Halloween costume 😂
This girl is so cringy and annoying
she got some seizure moves
Why does she look an energy drink
i respect you for not playing her song on your video
This is what overselling can lead to
Why is Chad so hot
mortal kombat crunch for the knee killed me
Why’d I think this YouTuber was Kallmekris (looks exactly like her)😭
we demand the old 'a twwwwingeee offf cringe' intro
She's completely convinced that she's some kind of gay metal jesus with everyone hero worshipping her and being fixated on what crazy world changing thing she'll do next. Despite all the horrible cringe I go through watching this I kind of feel bad for her.
Your content would be sick with a LUT on it 😌😁 just colour grade your footage a tiny bit to make it pop! 💪🏼
ok no but the fact chad chad is such a mood tho makes it funnier
I’ve seen a comment where someone said she looks like Queen Barb from Trolls 2, and now I can’t unsee it.
JoJO? MaMA?? ChadCHAD??? I've got my eye on you .
Ever since she "came out" it was nothing but downhill for her mental health XD
"shoot.. crap..... fiddlesticks..." HAS ME ROLLING ON THE FLOORR I CANTTT
Chad Chad you are adorable I'm sorry 😭🤣😂
i wasn't ready to see real footage of the music video again... im getting war flashbacks 😭😭😭

Another example of how the industry ruins children.
I need this copyright free version on my spotify playlist 🤧
hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
She's dressed like Gene Simmons got attacked by a bedazzler...and she doesn't know who Gene Simmons is. Ffs.
The outfit is giving party city Otep
I mean it makes sense. These stars go to this extreme to drive the message home to oblivious parents who refuse to see the obvious.
Can we talk about how it's not even her song? It was originally recorded and performed by Brit Smith in, like, 2010 or something.
why does jojo talk with the exact intonation and cadence as mark L walberg in the cody ko/kelsey interview? but for jojo to be talking about a song that apparently wasn't even hers in a rebranding arc that has been done so many times, even using it as a punchline in sitcoms is a trope,,,,,,,,, not to mention all the allegations about XOMG................ girl u have no right to be this smug
She came back as a different boomerang
I'm I the only one who saw the like button turn rainbow when Jojo said "Like it or not"😭
you singing at least it saves me from drinking a bleach.
This song makes me want to drink bleach. 😵
Jojo is a walking caricature of a butch lesbian but doing a cringey job at it.
shes giving lesbian jake paul
Chad Chad release a new video asap cause this is your 69th video
Chad Chad gotta have a collab with KallMeKris sometime
2:18 IS SHE BALD?
unrelated but when Jojo said "like it or not" around 6:20 your like button lit up.. xD
Jojo 🤦🏾‍♀️
Even Chad Chad is better at dancing then Jojo siwa
Is that a bad girl snail trail running down her chest?
~d~~
Don’t ever compare a masterpiece like Jojos bizarre adventure to this shit
my fav thing is how she didnt even write karma, its a song she bought from 2012 LMAOO
Miley did it better. And afaik she did it to get the Disney corpos off her back. If it's true than I respect her for that.
That ponytail definitely caused brain damage being that tight for so long😂😂
I don't mean to be too vulgar, but oh my gosh
this is your 69th video btw 🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
Shes going through her miley cyrus era
Isnt she 22 too? 😅
I feel bad for her. Her mother is so controlling, I don’t even think this is her trying to freak away from her old persona, it’s just her mom encouraging a new one.
10:36 bro her flying into thescreen 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Am I the only one living for it? Like I'm sorry that it's not cringy to me but I grew up watching Trisha Paytas & Jeffrey Star...you can't scare me 🤪 I love drama like this cause it feels like 2021 all over again lmao
Jojo, sweetie. You're not special, okay? We've all seen our favorite celebrities go from child star to adult star. She acts like every childhood star acts immature forever and she's like what 20 already? Literally no one stays immature forever, she acting like she's the first *big child star* to do this "big jump"
You can also hear her trying to emulate Miley’s voice
Jojo sounds like she swallowed a handful of rusty razorblades
My body could be three times more dense than it is right now and I still wouldn’t be this full of myself.
your dancing was so good of course youd be the avatar
When jojo said “like it or not” the like button started glowing lol shoutout to jojo for the reminder to like the vid
You didn't have to go that hard during the reenactment. But you did. Thank you for that.
I lowkey feel bad for her.. she’s absolutely been manipulated by the adults around her her entire life and even still as an adult. It’s like her whole life is a pr stunt. Idk, she should be able to have been a normal child with a normal life.
I'm convinced Jojo Siwa put Kizbop out of business
“Automatons are just knock off terminators “  *phonk plays*
9:08 I appreciate a fellow Harvey stan! This man needs love~ 💜💜💜
5:21 LMFAOOO HIS FACE 😭😭
This makes me sad cause at least Miley’s rebrand songs were good.
It looks like she was gonna go on her usual Claire’s run at the mall, but happened to spot hot topic out of the corner of her eyes 😭 but she only stayed in the sanrio/earring/anime merch part of the store
um, where the heck is your outro?? i watched the whole video, and you didn’t even thank me for it?? and i miss the oof :((( i’m very disappointed in you, chad chad ☹️
You dance like Howard the Alien and it’s fuckin’ badass.
why have i never seen this gem of a tuber... life is now changed
jojo went from her lisa frank to her sharpie mode
what is chad chad did movie review and it was called "a fringe of binge" I think that would be pretty sweet right guys
she didnt even write karma chadchad make a part 2 jojo siwa eledctric bogoalu
There have been two references to the FNaF analog horror series in the last two videos, is Chad Chad a secret FNaF fan?!
miley cyrus noo hannah montana still slaps i promise
This made me laugh so much my brother is leaving to go to college in August and Im crying thank you❤
"Fiddlesticks"? Unsubscribed. Such filth.
she has the same warning as gacha life 13+ videos
Did we learn nothing from Hussie????
I love everyone making jojo’s bizarre adventure references. The brain rot shall consume us all.
Should anyone care?
the entitlement of thinking you "invented queer music" of any kind - lil nas x, troy sivan, rebecca black, kehlani, hayley kiyoko, etc etc (those are just *some* of the *most well known* in the pop genre only and in recent years)...look around, step back, shut up, and maybe uplift other queer artists instead of erasing them
The thing that hurts the most is that this is clearly Jojo's mother setting her up for embarrassment and failure. Like yeah, Jojo Siwa is an adult now, but a very young adult. We were still dumbasses when we were 20 and we didn't know any better.
Be careful using the Lords name in vain :)
9:47 holy shit bro r u the next avatar
Ok, official ranking: 1- Chad Chad 2- Brit Smith 3- the metal clanking sound
I was thinking Miley the whole time, eww.
Why does JoJo sound like shes smoked 2 packs a day for 20yrs?
2:13 thank you for including this warning, i should’ve listened to it bc I am now scared for life.
she’s so debbie ryan
10:27 Jojo reference??😍😍😍😍😍😍
Not me instantly clocking the tf2 song at 5:15...
Mom this is not a PHASE era
She's probably gonna have a breakdown in a few years and god knows what kind of abuse she went through as a child star. She's playing out a blueprint so I think people should just ignore her "rebranding". She clearly doesn't know who she is or how to transition into adulthood.
No one has made this dramatic of a change   Bella thorne:   She was a cbildhood actor and this was her "this is no longer for kid" Video  https://youtu.be/uR5b5zaI_9k?si=-JpjI8EiPN187hmZ
Cute
Eating while watching a Chad Chad video was a mistake. Inhaling food while laughing so hard is dangerous you guys!
its giving me when my parents yelled at me for throwing around the pissdrawer
as a german the number plate at 7:13 is extremel funny, mpu literally being the psychological test yyou have to take after loosing our drivers license
is she a biker for "The Humungus" from Mad Max 2.. his best friend lol got killed by the kid who had the boomerang!! ah also found a new channel to sub to and more videos to watch and like.. ty Chad Chad
Harvey?...Harvey.......HARVEY?!?!?
Jojo is literally acting the SAME. She is just as energetic and shouting and jumping like a baby rabbit on... something.
She looks like Jake Paul's little sister
Jo-Jo: “noone has made a change like this” Ariana grande:
9:49 ATLA REF??
Pulled out the phone stand for this one
abby lee must be so disappointed in the dance idk man imagine being emotionally abused and forced overwork just to for that
the only thing she is edging is my lack of will to live
As a red blooded male of the species I'm not convinced this JoJo has GONE SEXUAL like she'd like us to believe
I preferred chads version of the song
She didn’t even write Karma 💀💀💀 she made all these videos of like “when I was writing karma” and she just bought the rights to a song that was supposed to be for Miley
Jojos mediocre adventure.
TBMC
I get such insanely uncomfortable secondhand embarrassment from Jojo whenever she talks now & most of the time when she's not even saying anything. It looks like she's channeling a 15yr old boy from the '90s who wants everyone to notice how "unique" he is for wearing black lipstick & black eyeliner. That dance looks like she's trying to copy Michael Jackson, but looks like she's having a painful seizure instead.
Whi is "Jessica" Siwa??
Well "Karma" isn't her original song.  Think it was written for Miley Cyrus but song by Brit Smith's back in 2011.
the bone breaking xD
The “predictions” came out after she released a teaser ( I hate that I know this )
That avatar edit was fire
this was appropriately goofy.
The avatar dance sequence was beautiful, thank you 😆
What is the difference between Jojo Siwa and the children my basement?              Jojo Siwa came out.
Asbestos muffin. I'm baking these muffins Asbestos I can. https://youtu.be/1tcR19y7GPM?si=6o0NhJiDu956q6Tn
That bomarang hit jojo hard
When she was in an interview talking about doing the song Karma, she was like "I didnt want to say i was a bad girl, because i WASNT a bad girl" so even she knows shes forcing this bad girl thing
Jojo be like I once but chilli flakes in my mayo, now i am a baaaad baaad S.O.B.
Gene Simmons will sue you, he is a businessman. At least be original.
Extremely cringe
She's just giving me little kid trying to get your attention while they do a shit cartwheel, "look at me! You're not looking! Watch me do this!!"
Don't you think this video is bullying?
do you think jojo has like sleep walking but for dancing?
9:47 see that in the club and I'm buying a wedding ring right there
I appreciate the jjba reference
How can she go through a rebrand when she acts the exact same just in different outfits
9:45 i didn't know we were on the presence of nothing more, nothing less and nothing more than the avatar
The stripe under her chin looks like a beard
“That had music and video.” said with flawless curtness, as the sign behind her is half-obscured and thus reads only “Really.” is either a happy coincidence, or the cherry on top of the most exquisitely directed music-video-reaction-video I’ve ever seen. The screaming dog moment had to be reviewed multiple times to contextualize. I’m crying, that was perfect.
Guys she IS the first of a generation--when have we ever seen someone fail from a LACK of drugs and alcohol?
She should check out The Pretty Reckless. Taylor Momsen could teach her some things.
wait her ears have never fallen out? no way! i gotta get some! /j 4:08
i feel like comparing JoJo's outfit to KISS is disrespectful to them tbh, at least they made it work and weren't just covered in e.l.f eyeliner 😭
Lady.. you are very beautiful. Talented and funny as well but, you should like your face. It's a nice face. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Just saying.
she's so unfortunate looking
The dedication to attempt to learn the dance for the video 😂😂😂  Love it, fckn hilarious. Another instance of why I'm subbed
Imagine getting to say you got jumped by jojo siwa. That’s some crazy shit.
I'm not a fan of Miley but JoJo isn't Miley. Miley just happened. JoJo needs meds, I mean Miley probably does too, okay so we all do but anyway. Kinda reminds me of when I was a teen and got into Marilyn Manson and then started wearing crazy eyeliner and got my nose pierced (illegally).
My granddad had that exact same shirt idk how to feel about this
Chad Chad need to make a video about book tok because it’s def out of hand..
idky i just discovered you today but thank you to jojo sewer and etc for their stupid idea, idiots CAN be useful after all
Jojo siwa reminds me of how famous people in cartoons act like
based harvey stardew valley enjoyer
There is a pattern and this is the same as Hannah Montana X Miely Cyrus... Turning a public figure from being happy, bubbly all those good traits into 180 degree the opposite...  A way to prepare to shutter the mentality of the younger generation now , and prepare them for depression and so on by seeing so many of their loved public figures turn crazy ... This is what happened to us with Hannah Montana and others of our beloved artists.  Spreading depression and breaking the happy innocent mentality... Thats why she said , only she knows whats happening or whatever.
It’s embarrassing, the look, the makeup, the music video, the choreography, the fact she didn’t write the song. She needs to take several seats and just stick to selling kids merch.
Lmao I'm not gonna lie I mostly consume christian content so I don't get out there that much and this is the only vid ive seen from you but those avatar the last Airbender animations with you dancing literally had me in tears on the floor 🤣🤣🤣 I don't know why lol
the dancing in bed got me- 😭😭
5:14 ARCHIMEDES?? TF2 SONG DETECTED???? WHAT????
Ik someone said this last time but no more “tysm for watching” to end the video 😭
Kinda think she’s kicking up this much fuss because she’s not the prettiest girl her age to do music.  Not saying she’s ugly but simular artists have quite a lot riding on their appearance that she can’t match
7:03  chadchad : stop car rapping 💔 car : nah, imma do my own thing
9:10 is so real 😭
HARVEY!?!?!??! were just gonna gloss over that?
looks like a kiss/bjork cosplayer.
who is this husky girl? what is with the bows?
no one in this generation has ever made such a dramatic change in their LIVES 😤😤😳
Ma’am….HARVEY??
the bending took me out
Weird that you’re doing a video on JoJo Siwa’s edging era, but okay, if that’s your kink…
Harvey from Stardew Valley 🥺🥺
One of two things happened: 1. Her boomerang came back contaminated and hit her two hard 2. The candy from that candy store was laced
I had no idea who Jojo was before this, but why didn't she just like smoke cigarette or something.
It’s giving “I’m Renasha Bliss and I’ll be your freestyle dance teacher”
Can you please talk about tiktoks KAPOW MEGGINGS (yes, mens leggings)?!?!?!
hehe love the undertale music
Honestly I get serial killer vibes from her..  she may actually be more edgy than we thought.
WHY DO YOU NEVER POST I NEED U TO POST MORE PLEASE HUXUASGYYWECGASKCDUNEDJGI
Its OBVIOUS to tell she is trying to go the Miley Cyrus route. The issue is tho, SHE IS NOT MILEY CYRUS.
I’m sorry but the music video is lit
this is chad chads 69th video
i saw a video with a comment “jojo got akumatized!” and i can’t stop thinking about it 😭
That "not really" was haunting
I’m convinced she signed a contract where she has to bring up the fact that she’s lesbian, at least once every interview
Jesus loves you and He’s alive you can talk to Him and He a has loving Father that can be your Father and will teach and lead of your identity and a Spirit that is most powerful of all
Off topic, but sometimes it’s crazy to think about how far ChadChad (not really) has come since joining YouTube. Like in three years she’s got 2.45million subs, and only one video under a million views. Actually crazy stuff. She really deserves it!!!
She gotta be Trumps long lost daughter or something 😂
Damm, exactly as cringe as it looks, hope she gets more into it so it can evolve. It looks like she hasn't seen much outside the media culture she came from.
didn't she literally steal that song word for word from another artist?
Shes being cringe on purpose so that people watch her more.
she needs to fire her whole team i’m so serious
“no one has made this dramatic of a change” *Melanie Martinez in the corner*👁️👄👁️
I feel bad for her honestly.
This is if lady gaga and gene simmons had a baby
Jojo looks like Junker queen from Overwatch
Jojo Siwa is going to join Gwar and revitalize them
Ahh, arrested development at its best.
Already know this story, but here for the Chad Chad vibes
Just like with Cyrus, she's trying to show everyone she's an adult by acting like she's 14. You don't need to do this shit for people to respect you as an adult.
She is what a Disney or Nickelodeon show would depict a bad girl as
the element bending lmao
Her new look is literally just a Kiss cosplay.
Are we gonna talk abt how entertaining chads edited jojo dance is  If jojo put element bending animations to her dance I might have liked it more too
just an off topic.. after seeing ALL haley edits on tiktok.. what do you think about it?
You didnt thank me for clicking on your video out of allllll the videos here 😔
10:01 damn you look old yet so young
Help my teeth hurt i cant stop eating ice, HELP
Change your new look before anyone thinks you're nutz.
JESUS CHRIST LOVES UU ALL. ✝️🖤🖤🖤
Technically her fans and her demographic is younger.. and majority of people hating and getting annoyed by her are not fans.. just people who was never her target demographic to begin with.. but exposure is great i guess.. im no jojo siwa fan.. but the hate shes getting is so stupid.. cuz its not like its her fans that are dragging her bcuz it was bad.  But its the peope around her that doesnt know her music or her as a internet personality.. and they are the ones with harsh comments and making fun of her as if they know her enough to judge her.. and thats the sad reality of the internet and being a celebrity..
It reminds me of the glothar advert Lolol
We have gene simmons at home the gene simmons at home:
The elemental bending with the dance was fucking perfect and hilarious😭
oh how i miss the rainbow pink unicorns and nickolodean era
Yall I heard she was lesbian  Not funny but it is
She has always reminded me of Jake Paul and the comparison keeps becoming *more* accurate as her career continues.
jojo siwa cringy era
0:51 I guess the glow stick went out
The difference between Miley Cyrus' transition from children's entertainment star to general pop star and what Jojo Siwa is doing:  Miley's transition was a personal choice that she made because she wanted to start doing her own thing instead of having to follow the strict formula of a children's entertainment star and without having to worry about whether her art was appropriate for kids and she basically decided that she was all grown up so it was time for her art and her career and her public image/persona to be all grown up as well and also decided it was time for her to go independent and get rid of all the handlers that exert control over her entertainment career; whereas with Jojo Siwa none of this is genuine or her choice, it's not the result of her deciding that its time for her art and her public personal etc to grow up just as she has and the result of her going independent and doing her own thing, rather it's all a completely choreographed and extensively planned out publicity stunt conducted at the behest of her mom and the corporation & PR team(s) that control her career and her whole persona and all that.  This whole thing Jojo is doing has been meticulously planned out ahead of time and is designed to mimick what Miley Cyrus and others like her did. Only this time it isnt organic or genuine but is instead completely manufactured & fake. That's why she keeps coming off as a little kid playing dress-up as a provocative adult popstar, like shes Miley Cyrus' little sister or little cousin and is immitating Miley. It's why she keeps repeating buzzwords and key-phrases in all her interviews as if she's following a well-rehearsed script. Why she keeps calling herself "a psycho/psychopath" and saying "omg people probably think im a total psycho lololol 🤪" Because her mom and her PR team want people to react to what she's doing the way they reacted when Miley Cyrus became "grown-up" and rode the wrecking ball & twerked on Robin Thicke's Thick Robin. They want that "controversy" and for people to be shocked.  Only problem is that it's so insanely obvious that it's completely staged & manufacturered & phony. When Miley did her thing you could tell it was the real Miley doing what she wanted to do. With Jojo you can tell it's not the real her at all and is just as phony and manufactured as when she was wearing bright pink and glitter and was on Nickelodeon etc etc.
She just looks like a weird KISS fan
These comments are gold  I love the internet sometimes
Jo jo is turning into a big girl
Why are women so insufferably predictable? News flash - behaving like a shore (replace s with W) isn't original or edgy. It's literally the standard and what happens to every single child star when they hit 18, Miley Cyrus being a prime example. She seems to think that her being LGBT and a shore is going to make her appear edgy. Jokes on her because our society completely normalizes degenerate behavior such as that. There is no longer anything edgy about it, this isn't 1942.
This is my new fav channel 🥺
Descendants ahhh era
I know basically nothing about Jojo but all these clips of her just screams narcissistic to me. Not trying to be rude or diagnosis a stranger but it's just....ugh idk it's just cringey and weird to me.
You still had better moves than JoJo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It was pretty bad
I mean, come on....we all knew this was coming. It was inevitable.
13:49 last comment
who else thought this content creator was kallmekris
she's so stuck in 2005, she'd probably have an aneurysm if she sees the tamest mlp rainbow dash inflation diaper fart r34
It's funny because the song would've ended up being about unicorns and glitter if she didn't COPY the whole song from other artists, Brit Smith, Timbaland who orginally sung, Karma’s A Bitch.
Joe do you get from family friendly to 18 years and old!?!
TF2 MUSIK USED
The bad rebranding is a decades old trend among Disney stars. Remember Xtina? Men do it too but it's quickly forgotten. I appreciate that Jojo is trying to contribute to queer culture. I just think Dove Cameron did it first and better with Boyfriend.   I'm not surprised she's abusive. Her mom and everyone on Dance Moms normalized it for her. I can't believe people supported that show.
it seems Jojo is going on a bizzare adventure
Chad chad is the kind of YouTuber to manifest in your living room from thin air to rant about something, then vanish from existence and never come back to your house.
Subscribed as soon as I saw the Jojos Bizzare Adventure reference 😭
Really looks like a poor man's KISS
I’m getting “It isn’t a phase mom” vibes from this
She looks like a KISS reject
When I was little my mom bought me a cupcake flavor lipgloss from her makeup brad (I ate it)
9:51 werk
show us more bones
That thumbnail makes her look like she's about to join a Norwegian Black Metal band either that or KISS
She's trying SO hard to be a gay icon. When will she realize it isn't something you work towards, it's something that just happens 🙄
Ngl Jojo siwa is still the same high energy person but reskinned by a kiss fanboy
You look like Lana Del Rey
omg I have the same giant dino plush
Kanye West reference???
those antidepresivos must be good
the shane dawson is so real and i appreciate this
the dog was like: "hell naw im going back into the cage"
Before this all i remembered about jojo was hearing she was going bald because of her hairstyle. So I guess her marketing IS working lol
From one kind of a pop singer to another kind of a pop singer, wow, such a drastic change! So rebellious!   You know what would be a lot more shocking? If one of these kid stars went from pop to black metal just out of the blue. Like proper church-burning black metal that sounds like it was recorded in the basement of a burning church. Kid showing up to a red carpet event in proper corpse paint and real blood on their face. Now that's what I want to see.
I was a bagel. 🥯
Is jojo the new drake?
*I feel kinda bad for Jojo.* She's clearly been shielded her entire life, and the environment around her has probably stunted her growth.  Clearly this is a big change _for her,_ even though the rest of us just see an edgy teenager in an "adult" body, trying to reach maturity with obvious growing pains.  I mean, we've all gone through "a phase"... I guess it just comes later for some of us💀
whatever shes on she needs to gimme some 💀😭
To be honest I’m afraid of jojo
why is Jojo being so bizarre?
Yes Harvey let's gooooooooooooooo
Jojo has as much edge as a dull pebble.
only thing scary about jojo siwa is that forehead
This is what happens when u don't sell you're soul to get into Hollywood.....talentless
this video is truly a work of art.
We have to get a stardew valley play through video from u bro! I know game playthroughs aren't something you really do but u should do it. PLEASEE OM BEGGING YA😭🙏
9:47 chad chad being the next avatar 😍
“the music video is where shi gets real crazy” you were hmping the air.
That’s not adult music That’s little girl who thinks she’s an adult music
she lowkey sounded like debby ryan in that one interview "i said down with the executive of disney and i said, 'i wanna make history.' and bam."
“It was an accident😢.”  “You were an accident 😡🤬”
She got that Miley Cyrus French bulldog gravel voice and the veneers of a Greek statue lol. Gene Simmons is fairly prone to litigation so she might wanna be on the lookout for a cease and desist from Kiss
Not me having to put a comment just to see my username-
And it's not even her song!
jojo:im a bad girl i show my belly button
Im listening to this while working on a JJBA campaign so seeing my boys cameo made me laugh
She would have been better off starting an only fans because actions speak louder than words.
she’s going through my 1st grade Emo phase
NOOOO BECAUSE WHY DO I SEE A WACKY BUDGETED VERSION IF KISS AND PINK HAD A BABY 😭
you are funny. good job.
Brand new viewer, first video ive clicked on from you , sound effects galore in the first 40 seconds, no thank you .
It was all a big ol' marketing strategy... over the long term
youre a harvey girlie?? how am i both shocked and not surprised at all 😭
i just love how she doesn’t say “fuck” and only says effed around😭😭😭😭😭😭
8:01 help😭
Sono chino sadame…. JOOOOJOOOO
I only just found out about her and I hate her already.
Weird that I see a book about Jojo Siwa(kid version) on a Booksale branch here in the philippines. Fate can be weird sometimes.
Jojo is a poser..... Just like all the other progressive liberal types
I was really on her side everyone deserves to express themselves but then she stole a song so that made me upset
KARMAS A BETCH IVE SHOUOD HAB NO BETER
Also crazy how her veneers literally glow in the dark. Imagine being in a dark room and all you see is a floating smile with a raspy voice saying I've been a bad girl. Sh*t would get me f*cked up.
"YOU were an accident!" 😂 🤣
6:24
Love the poster from Pinely's video.
69th video
The last minute of this video was about as painful as JoJo Siwa
as a misogynist i enjoyed this video
It’s honestly kind of adorable and concerning that her idea of “edgy” was a gayer version of KISS, something only a 6 year old would dream up.
Goodbeyeee JOJO
Her outfit looks like a just dance character
Y’all wanna talk about dramatic changes, let’s not forget how Taylor Momsen, formerly in How The Grinch Stole Christmas, Spy Kids and Gossip Girl, left gossip girl and formed a hard rock band called The Pretty Reckless, no rebrand will ever match up to that  😂😂
whatever. Let her do what she wants, she's not hurting anyone. Cliche yep. but guess what? so is most shit around. it's cliche for a reason. because it works. I've never understood the hate towards jojo. not saying this to chad, but the comments.   I just don't like the possibility that her mom is pulling the strings. I want her to be free.
She did come back but she didn't come back like a boomerang
JoJo Siwa is acting like a child saying "fuck" for the first time
Jojo doesn't know who Gene Simmons is, Jojo doesn't know who Brit Smith is. Jojo only knows Jojo
Is Jojo real? lol
I WAS A BAGEL 😇😇😆😆😆😡😡😡😇😈😈
She looks like an akumatized Miraculous Villain. XDD
karma cray
karma was wild
gosh darn gee whiz
Who wore it better, Jojo Siwa or Miley Cyrus?
The song's not even hers😭
The worst part for me isn't the dancing or the singing or the music (which is ALL terrible. It's that she is trying to come off as some sort of Chadette pussy slayer and like... nope. She did create a new genre though I suppose 🤔 I would put it in the "ugly lesbian thinks she's a 10 and that people want to see that shit".
Proof narcissistic personality disorder isn’t always something one is born with??
Abby is coming back like a boomerang 😭
You liking Harvey in stardew valley tells me everything I need to know about you
10:29 or for short, jojo^7
I feel like her saying "IDK who Gene Simmons is or anyone that they are saying I look like" and "IDK who Brit Smith is" is just her trying to defend her blatantly copying others. Like, she is young, so she may be telling the truth. But it also seems like a defense mechanisms.
I'm neither a fan nor in the demographic (by a few decades) so this is an unbiased comment: She was a child star who was forced to be a certain thing. She's now gotten away from that "thing" and unfortunately has to spend her 20s doing what we were able to do when we were in Middle and High School, which is finding who you actually are as a person. It's much harder for her because Television and tween girls told her who she had to be for the last like 6-7 years and now she has Millions of people watching her find who she is especially as an LGBTQ personality.
If she really wanted to be taken seriously, she should have dropped the song without any of this weird build up and actually had the balls to cuss in said song
There's already a term for "gay pop", JoJo. Pop.
5:21 girl thinks she’s the first one to do it 💀 she thinks she ate the whole thing up 💀💀 I will kindly say this. I wish Jojo would get off social media :)
Shes just so full of herself and bullshit its so pick me
I like her nice new look!
DUDE ISTG U LOOK LIKE JUST A GIRL IN MY SCHOOL,
Okay... How does she not know who Gene Simmons is 😭
JOJO🌈: I’m a big girl now Me: Your car still has your face all over it
9:46 IS MY FAVOURITE
gay pop? never heard of that before...  who are even bowie, hayley kiyoko, renée rapp, clairo, mad tsai, girl in red, fletcher, chapell roan, kehlani, l devine, frances forever, nxdia, etc etc
Murdoc could beat her
She like edgy but if you sanded down the edges
Maybe, no one cares
Her new song and rebrand is just a shitty cover of a song, while lying saying she invited “Gay Pop,” but the song is just a kidz bop song with a shitty metal outfit. There’s nothing wrong to write a song for someone else, the problem is completely lying about it and saying it’s about her ex acting like she wrote it.   It just feels like she’s trying to hard to be “different” and “mature” when all she did was go from wearing colorful sparkles to black sparkles. On top of that she’s still friends and stands buy ppl like James Charles and Colleen Ballinger. She’s embarrassing.
Hell nah, she was a bagel?!? 🥯
Thinking 'gay pop' is a new concept is uh...interesting.
All I can think of is that one episode of Hannah Montana where she went Metal/Rock and Roll
Tbf she does seem to be having fun and isnt hurting anyone so eh
Bro did not come back like a boomerang💀💀
It feels like a sanitized Disney version of becoming an adult artist lol
You know, i had always thought jojo siwa's whole thing was just a persona. Like behind the neon and bows there's a normal mature person who has normal interests and stuff. But like? This whole thing seems so childish in the way she approaches trying to look like an adult it makes me wonder if she's ever gone outside
That girl said “FIDDLESTICKS”
Chad Chad?  More like rad rad
Yeah she was a pretty bad girl, once, she dropped her bow in a dirty puddle ON PURPOSE😦
i went to check on the lyrics for karma for the first time and ngl, it's soooooo funny that she's trying so hard to advertise herself as a Grown Adult™ but 1) the lyrics feel like they were written by a teenager and 2) why is she saying "bitch" with her whole chest but not "fuck"? "effed" sounds like someone who really wants to curse but is scared their parents find out. like girl chill out, you're not even legally allowed to drink yet  also, the whole line of her being salty that her ex is going out with a "boring girl" SCREAMS "not like other girls energy" lmao
She's discovered Cocaine. Mystery solved
Her outfit and face paint is giving Lexa from The 100
This is the sixth time I hear about asbestos, how is that even possible.💀
Now a mean girl and a bad girl are two different things.
10:26 JOJO REFERNCE!?
" where's was the humping? I WANA SEE HUMPING!" - chad chad Apr 14 2024
I just wanna know why she still puts her hair up so high
This is the same thing that's happened to other child stars. Brittany Spears, Lindsey Lohan, etc. We need to stop being surprised by it at this point.
I have the same dino plushie :D
Same moves she did on dance moms
Jo mama
I like your version so much better! 😂🫶
Oh great, thanks a lot, my parents walked in while I was watching this video and heard you say "ghee whizz" and now I'm not allowed to watch YouTube for a month.
11:05 wait she had surgery and went? Ahhh sounds like a skill issue
It's been a while since we heard from  (BAD BAD) chad chad   How is she in life
JoJo Siwa is gonna be addicted to so many drugs when she grows up
I’ve never heard her voice out of her songs before… yowch. She oughta stop that tight ponytail before she scalps herself.
Please do a collab with cody ko 😭
omg the Shane Dawson comment 😂
MY GIRLY HAS BEEN AKUMATIZED BY HAWKMOTH FROM MIRACOLOUS LADY BUG
That music video was so lesbian and crazy
I know this Siwa person only as the person who comes up whenever I look up stuff for jojo’s bizarre adventure.
Jojo stole 2 songs. She stole karma and when I mean stole I mean that she claimed she wrote karma but she didn’t and it was actually a song called “karmas a b!tch” by Brit smith. The second song she stole was a song called “choose your fighter” by Emeline. Jojo is claiming that she wrote this song(again🙄) bc of one of her exs and the crazy part is that she didn’t even try to change the original singers voice and is pretending she sang the song when it’s not even her voice.
This was not the rebrand we deserved 😞😞
I love how she's still keeping her vibe of being an 8 year old, it's so cool.
I can’t believe how late I am to watch my dear chad chads new video😭
Where do I get one of those sick ass deer shirts you have?
i died at the jojo referefnce and im subbbbbing to this RIGHT NOW!!
I didn’t really hear of Jojo Siwa all that much until recently but from what I have seen, either the lesbians fall in love with her based on 3 second clips of her doing something kind of attractive (I sadly fell victim to this, I’m lesbians), or everyone on the planet simultaneously bands together against her when she pulls these stunts lol. There is no in between, it’s so bizarre
In my edging era
9:46 Omfg Chad Is The AVATAR??
Honestly she’s gone from light mode to dark mode
So the zoomers Miley Cyrus
If she did nothing and just changed… it’d probably be something we take a bit more seriously, but her hype over it and her complete blindness to the fact that many many MANY other people have gone through changes like this.  It honestly comes off as a bit of a money grab and that makes me question her sexuality… was it influenced by social media and the desire for attention.
❤ love your channel
Dude i need a full essay video on this new jojo siwa pandemic
5:24 you should have put Bella Thorn there
She's so annoying.
remember miley cyrus putting on this nuts persona to escape from the disney image? this is like if that didn't happen irl but was an arc for the fifth season of hannah montana
Her music video was so viciously Disney channel I can’t even describe it
“I’m a psycho!” “No, you’re just being weird about your rebrand.”
THE OUTTO WHERE IS THE OUTTO???????????
She’s a bad Girl that’s why 🥰
Is that the Stanley parable elevator music in the background?
Well that was a Bizarre Adventure.
CAN U SPELL JOJO WITHOUT A BOWBOW?? NO NO- Brad Mondo🌸
i think that jojo thinks she's the only lesbian emo on earth or something 😭
JoJo‘s car is giving please listen to my song. I’m desperate and giving please paparazzi. Take pictures of me. Also, the music video is concerning also, I’m scared like 6 feet back
speaking of extreme switchups from child stars. Noah Munck (gibby) has a youtube channel called Sadworld Online
9:54 nailed it.
Okay, I feel like I have to bring this up as a point of genuine concern, is her voice okay?? In nearly every video I've heard from her, she sounds very congested or like she's straining to speak. This is not a person I feel like should be singing, I just want to give her some throat tea and tell her not to overdo it..
It just had to be THIS video where you make me subscribe 🤣🤣🤣
I wish every youtuber did sponsors like Chad. I absolutely eat those up.
THE JOJO RÉFÉRENCE AT 10:25 AHH
Wendy Sulca gringa XD
babe I'm sorry but Harvey???
Jojo's weed smorking girlfriends
Why was there an ATLA reference
that was…traumatizing
is it just me or is chadchad calmer
jojo needs to whip out her uklele and apologize rn
I LOVE YOU CHAD CHAD
CHAD CHAD I WAS JUST THINKING SBT YOU??
I feel like Jojo isn't here with us in 2024. She's in 2016 and thinks people are taking her and her "dramatic change" seriously
I can't wait for the Chad Chad diss
Wanting to smooch Harvey for 12h is the realest statement ever
so, based on the music video, are you telling me that the "bad things" jojo did are... kissing girls? fucking girls??? because like. if that's the case then lock me up i guess i could probably give her a run for her money
chadchad is the avatar?!
I just checked, this is her 69th video. (yes, I do act like a 12 year old boy. No I am not a 12 year old boy)
Dove and others be laughing their asses off in the corner
i just knew that chad was a harvey girl
Chad still being a giga Chad w her videos
I love how unimpressed your dog is. the whipped cream on top
Last day of being a child star? Babes i think you meant to say last day of being a star...
Harvey from stardew valley is so dreamy
She rebranded as Gene Simmons.
She’s having a golden experience
I know that this has nothing to do with the video but when i looked at the thumbnail I thought you were Kallmekris
People that have seen the video 😭🤚
Yo I'm wearing headphones, and the dog yelling took me OUT😂
When people want to talk about privilege. This is a privilege person
Jojo’s bizarre aven- I mean clothing
Her team should have gone to South Korea and let one of the brands build her brand. There's time.
I can't figure out this math problem Did you try breaking it down?  Ah shit, gimme a minute  9:53
Her mom looks exactly like sarah lynn's mom from bojack horseman
I think that boomerang hit Jojo siwa too hard
HUMPING I WANT TO SEE HUMPING
chad chad so pretty 🫶
Why is ChadChad talking about edging?
I've no idea who Jojo Siwa is (I've seen random mentions of her here and there and never seem to remember her or care enough to look her up). But wow. It's giving desperate and very cringe. Her little sequin outfit is weird, as is the fact the she's not even plugged in enough to her own branding efforts to know it's inspired by KISS. So she didn't write the song, clearly had no part in the image construction, and is going around doing these interviews taking credit for... what exactly? She looks 12 - okay, not her fault but it does make watching her try to act sexual VERY uncomfy. And and she seems cocky and insecure af. I deeply dislike her aura. But I'm going to subscribe to you because you made me laugh!
Black Spiderman arc but way less cool or scary
“Nobody has made a change this extreme” when poppy did it before AND better
The fact that she didn’t even write the song- she bought it 💀
help Jojo siwa got akumatised😭
It's like her parents are out of town for the weekend and she can cuss without consequences 😭
12:50  “I think moto moto likes you”
I would go and watch the music video. But that would validate their whole campaign. And i refuse to do that
Your dance moves have got to be the sexiest I’ve ever seen
Who else thought this was kallmekris for a sec
Considering that Jojo is tryna get away from her child image, and dancing is associated with that image, she still seems very eager to dance.
She went from an innocent girly girly girl she's a teenager trying to have the same aesthetic and Vibe as Lil Naz, Doja Cat, Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish combined. Doing what every other teenager/young adult star did to change their brand and try to be edgy doesn't always work and comes off as basic if you look back on what other people have done.  Personally , IMO, if she stayed with her current brand but aged it up and made it LGBTQ+ Positive, it would have probably been more well-received. But OH well.
Jojo did not come back like a boomerang 😐 11:32 (not me having the same dinosaur animal)😂😂😂 12:51 I’m adding this to my playlist. So far the best song I have heard😂😂😂 (chad chads version)
ur shirt is so cool um... where can i get it... <3
I went to one of her concerts when I was 5-6💀💀It was when she was a kid singer😭✋
Robin Scherbatsky predicted this...
This is the first video of yours I have ever seen.  I hope you don't disappoint me.
12:13 , This is honestly better than Jojo´s version…
The best part is that she didn't even write the song 💀. The origianal is from an artist named Brit Smith lmao.
JoJo's... transformation is like when Kelvin goes "bad" on Righteous Gemstones
you can take the  bow out of the ponytail but you cant take the ponytail out of the girl
You're like if drew gooden and Danny gonzales had a daughter  Edit: and I'm subscribing
8:10 - 8:17 It’s giving Lady Gaga’s “Poker Face/Bad Romance” but…make it more “emo”.
Actually need to see that framed and on the wall right in the same spot @ 12:00 We all agree... yes? 🤔
Ofc it was freaking Jessica💀
The song made me feel so uncomfortable I had to watch jojo parts 1-6 openings to feel better
Most cringy attention whore ever.
That look is literally Kiss but worse. Like maam, if you are gonna steal, do it well. (She stole the song too btw)
IS SHE A BENDER!!!  9:46
I relate to this in a very annoying "I wish I could erase those teenager years from my brain" way  😂🔫
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
Just watched 3 minutes ad of a woman talking about her cancer journey before this vid for chad chad. I'm so proud of myself😢
Her rebrand looks like she's on a episode of a Disney show with a subplot about one of the characters going through an "edgy" phase, only to inexplicably drop it by the end because now they're obsessed with frogs or something.
Stardew valley mentioned??
Harvey mention!!! Love that pixel man
When I saw the creepy mom, something clicked.
She really needs to tone it down a bit. She’s making such a fool out of herself.
Jojo whywa
She made me uncomfortable like, genuinely uncomfortable lol. Because the whole time she was always having that little girl image and her whole giant fcking bowtie, and then cut to now singing that.. "song", having those weird fcking make up like one of the 'kiss' band member and also Humping those poor girl on the music video
WHO
Hi
the jojo siwa version of karma was stuck in my head when it came out but as soon as i heard the brit smith version, i cant even remember what the jojo one sounds like
13:02 putting this on my playlist
“no one has made this big of a change yet“ BRO HAVE U SEEN MELANIE MARTINEZ
only thing i see looking at jojo is this child star from bojack horseman
Honestly, not a fan of this gremlin, but she got her marketing attention though
9:40 chadchad becomes water bender
hi
I CHECKED AND IT HAS 1.6M DISLIKES XD
A lot of it was cringy, but also, this kind of felt mean. I don't know this kid,  but she seems... fine. Another adult-produced pop star.
Does anyone else miss the old “twinge of cringe” voice 😔😔 (STILL LOVE THE NEW ONE THOOO)
You have that dance dowwwwnnnn lol
Jojo is an abomination to the LGBTQ community..... She destroyed a good relationship for a clout gave ptsd to the persons involved in the drama.... She has main personality syndrome but all she is a clown who keeps on clowning and making a fool of herself....
I know she’s young but surely she remembers Miley’s bad girl era? She cant possibly think she’s outdoing that
The way she acts makes me forget that she’s only a year younger than me and not a 12-year-old girl.
this is just too funny
To me she’s just living out her 20s, correct me if she did anything worse than being cringe and the driving in la lol
She sounds like she has smoked for a decade 😭
Nah the amount of injustice she does to so many LGBTQ+ music artists in the past by saying she's "inventing gay pop" like please educate yourself
Having her Miley Cyrus moment but worse
She has been in a bubble for too long. She looks and acts as 12-13 years old. And in actuality she in her 20th. That's sad... and very bad for her psychic in the future
Chad chad you put tf2 music in the background chad chad thats so cool
JJBA MENTIONED 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😢K vpp
She is basically going trough the same phases everyone else does but 10 years later
just thinking about Chad Chad's search history based off of these stock images
The real Jojo effect is Jojo having you practise her awful dance
Jojo: "I'm gonna invent a new genre" Also Jojo: steals a song that was originally made for Miley Cyrus, then passed to another artist, Brit Smith, who dropped it. (They released it on spotify a while ago)
my partner used to dance when they were younger and decided to make a better dance for the song… so it’s not impossible to choreograph this song jojo’s just an idiot
Her advertising is working so well. You made a video about the whole thing to get more normies to listen to the song, and now more people have heard the song and now it’s stuck in their head and you added the day it comes out, people are going to the video to see the reactions this totally worked for Jojosiwa if what she wanted was to promote her song by having this transformation
Her outfit is giving very Kiss
9:47 made my day😂😂😂
The fact that her disgusting song came right after my birthday is just something
The dog.!
Jojo is trying too hard to be unique to the point where she completely ignores all the superior artists that came before her😭
She doesn’t know who’s look she entirely ripped off??? It’s literally a rip off of exactly gene Simmons look.
I never heard of your channel and barely know jojo sywa but damn great video I love the editing keep it up
Lovin the Jojo reference🤣
1:31 She looks like a Nickelodeon character, like from Henry danger, because she is the danger, but the only is her dancing you to boredom
PLEASE I NEED BLEACH FOR MY EYES- PLEASE
Did anyone else had a glowing like button at around 6:24, when JoJo Siwa says 'like it or not?'
HARVEY MENTIONED!!!
Dove Cameron, Olivia Rodrigo, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomes, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato and every single young successful lady in the history of 21st century music. "Oh, she´s sexy now", "She is not a good girl anymore", "uuuuuh, she might be into girls too"... Yeah yeah, of course, just be careful with drugs, okay honey?
First time seeing one of your vids.Very funny.New Fan right here.
Melanie Martinez had a better switch of aesthetics. Jojo feels like what a 14 year old thinks is edgy b/c they aren’t actually in touch with their issues.  Melanie went from baby and childhood trauma to etherial existence after death something only briefly touched on in a few lyrics of several songs and in her K-12 movie.
Dude I was literally thinking of Miley Cyrus on a wrecking ball and then you showed Miley Cyrus on a wrecking ball, but fr her saying the most dramatic change um yeah sure that’s tame compared some artist out there, also she’s basically a copy of all artist and bands, her outfit and style is a ripoff of kiss, her song was already done by another artist who’s arguably better imo,  and she’s getting tattoos left and write like a stamp tester 😂😂😂 I’m of the belief that some tattoos should have some meaning to them especially since it’s kinda permanent unless you have 1000’s of dollars for laser tattoos removal!
When did I click subscribe? Right after the avatar element-bending dance. Please start a petition for JoJo to make this her music video.
Brits ver is better
God this is almost worse than edge edge siwas “Jojo era”
Rebecca Black did it way better.
jo chad jo chad
jojo so goofy she summoned chad chad
"The stand user could be anyone in the room" is a joke I didn't expect to make twice in a week. Yet here I am.
Chad Chad shud invite Jojo Siwa on this channel!
the music video looks like dance dance revolution
Didn't jojo befriend and defend colleen ballinger, a literal pedo?!!
saw someone saying she just entered her middle school emo phase a lil late
It feels like an executive decided that she had to have her emo era now and she’s promoting it still with her *glitzy glitzy bow sparkle sparkle twinkle* energy
Jojo siwa looks like the youth division for the Kiss Army 😂
Chad Chad, 😂 I just almost choked laughing at this, you are too good I hope you never stop making comedy
Shes tryna get an icon emot
all of us need to have an "edging" era
Jojo apparently has never heard of the "dyke-core" genre
Also the fact that she DIDN'T EVEN WRITE THE SONG
What is Jojo talking about, k-pop is already gay enough.
Kissing Harvey from Stardew Valley is too real
I'm scared of her voice, does she do it for purpose?
i think people are being waaay too mean to her.
The thumbnail is giving lovers and reputation but worst 💀
The Avatar edit did it for me lol 😂😂 9:45
I’m quite surprised that you’re coming at this, from this angle. Throughout history young women in the music industry have been held to such a high standard, they’re objectified, abused, and when they aren’t perfect in the public eye they’re bullied. I love your content, I think you’re hilarious and I would have also considered you a feminist. But this just seems to go against that. Jojos mother objectified her from a young age, she’s experienced abuse from Abby, from dance moms alone you can tell her mother isn’t any better and that’s what we seen on camera. Her whole life has been about pleasing others and to become famous to please her mother. She’s clearly being controlled by her mam still. We’ve seen it so many times in child stars, where their parent controls them and uses them as a source of income. Basically grooming them into this lifestyle. I have a feeling we’ll be finding out more in the future when and if she manages to get away from her mam, or the team she’s working with
Is this the Robin Daggers-style of transformation?
It’s so crazy how she reminds me of Jake Paul
Her voice sounds like she’s been smoking the weed to much
Fiddlesticks is my new favorite Bad word 😂
Immediate subscribe when I heard Archimedes (my friends and family hate me bc i wont shut up about video game music)
I think Jojos poor ears would leak brains if she heard my playlist from 2012 😂😂 You didn’t just choose to be alternative cause it was “fun” and “different,” it was embracing all the dark, angry, frustrated, *emo*tions that you had. Making this “dark” and “scary” change and not even being able to SING the lyrics is laughable 😅it feels like she’s trying to make Edgy into mainstream, and that’s just…. Meh, not it.
Congrats on this being your 69th video on your channel Chad Chad
Well the YouTubers are getting good content
You can srsly tell she is just like a child pretending to be an adult when she puts a content warning for a song of her saying swear words that 10 year olds will say every day and her humping other women like a rabid dog in heat.
I found another danny gonzalez
the dog scream near the end got me so good 🤣
12:21 identical shot to the lil Nas x montero music vid
Nah Hailey from stardo Valley she's me wife
i don’t care about the rest of the video.. HARVEY???? WHYYYYYY????
"gay pop" was literally invented like 50 years ago
She actually looks like Gen Z discovered KISS lol
Chad Chad for Avatar 2024
i originally thought the idea this was horrible so that people payed attention but I now think it's just bad and no one was willing to tell her
i LOST IT at the scream edited onto the dog yawning i'm so sorry 💀💀💀
Earned a sub 😂
Jojo is proof that creativity is dead.
I don't know much about this person, I've only seen articles about her and scrolled right past. But if I had to guess, I would say she's not really spent much time around regular people, I thought I was edgy for stealing shit from work, until I found out everybody does it. Clearly she's never heard of any punk musicians, corr, some of them weren't just edgy they were properly nasty.
the fact that things had turned even more dramatically escalated in a span of days after this video is peak comedy..
10:00 Is that from Mortal Kombat (its the only game i know that has those x-ray parts in a scene)?
chad chad omg i remember seeing your older video on those ads on tiktok about the those weird trashy alpha wolf beta series whatever tf it’s called right,? it’s popping up EVERYWHERE in my fyp again, and they added more to that series apparently? can you do a part two on it PLSS , ily chady chad chad mwah
She came from pink fluffy unicorns dancing in rainbows to gay electric spider-
JO JO IS ALOWED TO EXPERMENT WITH HER FASHON TAST JESUSE GIRL WAS RAISED AS A DISNEY SHES FINALY FINALY BROKEN FREE OF THAT LET HER BEEEEE
Does Jojo think that being gay is a crime... still?
The comment section is wild 💀.
Shes just tryna ditch what she used to be (honestly don't know who would've been content staying like that) sometimes drastic measures are the only way.  Im willing to bet in a year or so she'll have toned it down but honestly it doesn't matter as long as she's happy   Also no one mentioning the mental strain it takes to be on a child pagent
She seems like someone who was sheltered until 3 years ago and learned cuss words and thinks they are edgy now
“Let me build up a huge following of small children and then intentionally become a bad influence and then say parents shouldn’t have let their kids watch me, even though I’d be an unknown loser without them”
the ending was so cringey, Of the dance video my eyes starting watering 😂 I was like Nooo What she jojo doing 😭😭
I want a side by side of her song and something by like methwitch
“She been doing weird things with fashion my knee hurts” it’s just, it’s the mood 💅😞🤌
I can’t decide if she wants to be a member of kiss or a professional wrestler perhaps the crow.
before i watch, can someone tell me if she plays the song? I have a medical condition and I can't listen to it. I love chadchad, but if the song gets played, I gotta pass. Lemme know
You and Johnny Guilbert should collab one day!
9:47 AVATAR!?!!?!?
9:11 This set me off cause i can go on and on defending Harvey for hours 😭😭 ChadChad is so real for this
Jo Jo trying to be edgy makes my brain cells deteriorate.
#EdgyPhaseAtTwenty
9:46 and when the world needed her most, she appeared
Im waiting for the "exposing" era of Jojo where she says who was really behind this karma thing, because I dont know... she seems midly uncomfortable with the almost kissing scenes, a 21 yo should have mastered at least being that close to someone and not acting as a kid trying to act as an adult...or so i think
6:24 not the like button lighting up when jojo said like it or not
Tbh, i have no problem with jojo being like emo or gothic, i have a problem with that song 😭
"i wanna create a new genre: gay pop" bitch what about chappell roan, troye sivan, conan gray, boy genius AND ALL THE OTHER ARTISTS THAT MAKE GAY POP BC ITS ALREADY A GENRE JOJO!!!
"STRONG LANGUAGE"
I ALSO WANT TO KISS HARVEY FROM STARDEW VALLEY FOR 12 HOURS
12:46  Best singing ever
chad chad, i love the video, but funky frog bait better
The Emo phase has been going wild
Had headphones in and almost pissed myself when your dog yawns in the song
Chad Chad is like a much younger sister that stays hip to things of which I would never find on my own, but I have to know so that my coworkers don't think I'm outta date (Which I am) so I listen to her go off on the daily random topic. The cadence and humor are like looking in a gender bent mirror, lol
Wtf did she say in the beginning clip 😭 all i heard was heldldobuebltodaaaee
Chad Chad I subscribed ❤❤❤❤love you
Wow how do you dress in what is essentially a Kiss costume but not even ever heard the name Gene Simmons,  that's actually wild... I really think her mom mighta chose the outfit but who knows
Yea what a way to attact n$fw people
not the avatar!!!!
She thinks everyone loves her. Not everyone. she is successful, and she does have fans, but she is overestimating herself by a lot like bro you ain't that good you're just pretty much copying other people.  don't get me wrong in not judging like do whatever you want just... it's not that big of a deal.  All this in the nicest way possible
So the song… it’s bad rlly bad
Juggalo Siwa
Chad chad never fails to be late to every popular topic❤❤❤
JoJo Siwa's going through the Miley Cyrus route!!
Tbh her new look is cool but not for her. She's acting like she's super different and quirky when she's clearly taken clothing style inspiration from artists decades older than her while making the shittiest, most basic music possible.
Honestly it makes her seem even younger, I was surprised to hear she's only a few months younger soon, she's almost 21. When I heard about it my innitial reaction was "Eh, she's just learning how to express herself, every teen goes through it." I still feel that way but it's obvious that her trying to be more adult is backfiring.
this isn't JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, it's Jimbo's Wack-ass Journey!
Team Fortress 2 Music !!
CHAD CHAD!!
her look is given obstagoon, the pokemon (look it up you know i’m right 😭
12:45 this version of the song is better
I NEED chad chad to do a part 2 with the fact that jojo's songs aren't even hers
I LIFTED UP FROM MY DRAWING WHEN I HEARD THE TF2 MUSIC 😭
She literally stole the looks of Kiss (the band)
New here. I love your comedy and this video, but your dog at 12:23 wins this one!
I THOUGHT THIS WHOLE TIME HER INSPO WAS KISS AND SHE DOESNT EVEN KNOW WHO GENE SIMMONS IS HOW THE FRICK DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO GENE SIMMONS IS
I know why she’s getting edgy. She’s growing up and starting to look just like her mom. That won’t generate $$
Did you get your raycon sponsor money?
HARVEY FROM STARDEW VALLEY MENTION  He deserves so many smooches ❤
conratiostoons on the 69th vidro
I’ve watched this six times💀
As far as I can remember the song wasn't originally JoJo siwa's song it was originally sung by Brit Smith who never released her version of the song
ChadChad we have the SAME fucking stardew valley boyfriend
she reminds me of onlyjayus
Jojo in 2022: 🌸🤩🥳😋☺️ Jojo in 2024: 🤡👿😼🦹‍♀️🐺
she did NOT come back like a boomerang
damn chad is schmovin
All I can see is a Paul brother when I see her talking.
12h dance days mean it’s hell week which usually means the performance is soon/there’s a time crunch it’s v common
This rebrand truly is bizarre and was an adventure hearing about this
"You look like a glam Gene Simmons." Girl, Gene Simmons is glam Gene Simmons.
It's like she is going through puberty. First, she was a little child with all the fluorescent sparkly clothes, and now she is in the emo phase of a teenager. Soon enough, she will be a businesswoman, working an office job.
Ngl I'm glad she's been talking about it for so long, that way less children will watch it Children will still watch it, but there's surely many parents that saw what was spoken about it and won't let their child see this atrocity
HARVEY STANS RISE UP
12:58 “messed around- effed around.”  Love the reference to the original song 😭
She’s not a kid anymore, she’s a bad girl … she even said the word “effed” 🫨   I’m gonna get cut from all that edge!
JoJo… oh no…
Something tells me jojo is just a tomboy and is just using identifying as a lesbian to garner unwavering support from the alphabet community. It’s not that she doesn’t SEEM gay, bc she seems gay af. Hahaha idk I guess I’m just a stupid person with a stupid opinion, hahaha seriously.
This take isn’t it. I’m no fan of hers, but that child has been abused and manipulated and used by adults for her entire life. Her mom has been bleaching her hair and forcing her into show business since 2 years old. Yes, she’s out of touch and she’s saying and doing ridiculous things. But it’s sad more than anything. We shouldn’t be making fun of her; we should be demanding justice for her and other “child stars” whose childhoods were ripped away from them. It’s really no wonder Jojo Siwa has no idea who she is/wants to be. We’d all be cringe too if we had the life she’s had
actually, i like your dance more
don't forget she's good friends with James Charles and colleen Ballinger.... her scandal is coming.
help! her teeth are glowing in the dark
I don’t see a difference..…
9:51 just dance jojo siwa
Whats beyond cringe is how she is pretending not to know who Jean Simmons is so she can say she came up with her look on her own....people in 3rd world countries know who that mf is
How much does JoJo smoke and drink? Her voice sounds like a 50 year old chain smoker. Or cocaine? Overall it could end more like the Lindsey Lohan transformation.
She looks like gene simmons💀💀
Top kek indeed.
This generation got ruined even more after ahe made this song
LMFAO wowww the fcking avatar dance moves LOL 9:43
I'm convinced she asked a PR team for suggestions on how to stop people from thinking she's still 12 and someone said "goth makeup" and another said "make dick jokes" and she just took it at face value and did those things.
Her new song sounds like those AI generated songs on reality tv shows. You know, the songs that don’t exist or have artists they just say, “I’m a bad bitch” and shit like that. (Mostly thinking of Selling Sunset/OC)
########
This is like if Disney Channel invented KISS.
This is so cringe
4:46 I’ve always wanted to do that, lucky chad. 😔
Your impersonation of dance mums is ON POINT. :O
Her most edgy thing to do is buy/steal the song from Brit Smith lmao
The gay pop interview had me crying👀
Your TV bring back vibes
Her “edgy” makeup looks like someone drew on her face with a sharpie while she was sleeping
She look like she's gonna audition for KISS band or BVB 😂😂😂
Jojo is banned in my home. Lol.
She's going through the stages of self-discovery that a 14 year old does, but with the expendable income and visibility of an adult celebrity. It's uncomfortable to watch.
This Jojo girl looks like she used to participate in those American’s beauty contests for kids with crazy moms and never got tired of it.
it's not even her song. She stole it.
Therapist: Dancing Chad Chad is not real, she can't hurt you Dancing Chad Chad:
"I wanna invent a new genre of music" she says after using a song that isnt even hers????
i had no idea in the first place who this jo jo person is, and i dont care now either  that tshirt tho 11/10
This is a distraction to get away from her allegations
the edit of your dog screaming scared the shit out of me. but in a good way.
You look like winona ryder
" the stand user could be anywhere! "   the stand user :
thanks for.... well, i suppose i learned something new about Jojo Siwa, i guess.
Dababy was right
Why's everyone always hating on women who just try new things and don't care a lot about y'all's opinion! Get over yourself and let her explore and express herself.... I'm so tired of people hating on women that are doing basically nothing to hurt anyone....
TF2 MUSIC SPOTTED
She’s acting insane on purpose so no one will realize she’s abusing kids on her show. She’s gay Abby Lee Miller fr
Whatever JoJo Siwa had to go through has already effected her life style to make her a horrible person.
I'm soo sick of these videos!!!! Stop feeding the plant!!
She just switched to dark mode on discord guys
Tbh i don't see the big problem. I don't know this girl, but i feel so much sympathy for her just from what little I do know. It's a tiny bit cringe, sure, whatever, I certainly wouldn't do it any better - I thought we all decided to be more cringe and more free and not make a big stink every time a very young person does something mildly embarassing. She's not Olivia. Olivia is straight and hyper skinny, she has it so damn easy. Jojo does not look like this kind of star is supposed to look, and I find it kind of endearing to see her try this "edgy" thing out, even if it isn't fully working. I don't like everybody making a big catastrophe out of it.
That's a boy. This is a teenage BOY. WTF is going on ?  It's a BOY !
Oooh, another little angel sponsored by a big company, who started all rainbows and unicorns, that parents thought their daughter could idolize, bc she's so innocent...  Who next goes through a weird phase, and becomes increasingly edgy, and inappropriate ?!?  Major companies billionnaire executives, have such bad luck that their artists turn young girls into freaks...that's certainly NOT a world they want to live in...right ?
Ur such a damn vibe! I love your videos!! NEEEVEER stop!!!! 😩🫶
Nothing says more that you're a rebel than having a meeting with your team of suits to get their approval for your rebranding and the release of your new song.
Lmao thought u was one of the girls gunna be talked about in the thumbnail then i realized your the one in the middle ya really look like ya fit in with the girls in the thumbnail
It feels like witnessing a psychotic break
I just feel bad for her. She’s another former child star struggling in front of a huge audience and is becoming worse for it. Maybe i feel so bad for her because Dance Moms is insane to me.. like televised child abuse and humiliation
Im old enough to remember when Christina Aguilera came out with Dirrty. We were not prepared. She just dropped it.
Random european core question, why do your dogs sleep in cages?? is that common in America?? kinda weird (sorry lmao)
hello chad chad
I am a HUGE fan of using Archimedes from the TF2 soundtrack as background music 5:16
Is it just me or does Jojo seem like a female version of Jack Paul? I mean that in the worst possible way
chad chad, imma need you to do some kind of review of this melanie martins series, blossom in winter. ive been seeing her books hyped all over tiktok (like to the point of women literally screaming about how good the book is), so i went to check out the back of the book and theres an almost illegal age gap between the two main characters (the girl starting off at 17 and then turning 18 and the man (her GODFATHER and her dad's COWORKER) being 41 years of age). i have seen NOTHING but hype for this damn book series and rarely any negative feed on the gross age gap. Ive recently started seeing that, for those who hype up the book, she's so super friendly with, but to those who discuss their discormfort with reading about a 17 year old wanting to get with her dad's friend, she's rude and spiteful to. i have screenshots on a couple of the comments and the difference is absolutely nasty.
my cat’s name is also bones!
As someone who watched all of dance moms (I love trash), that description is quite accurate.
9:08 Bye that's literally the realest thing I've ever heard 😭
literally queen barb from trolls 2
Well she's been a bad girl... she did some bad things. 👀 Honestly tho, she's 20 years old, A CHILD, ofc she thinks she's so dark and cool XDDD CRINGE FEST
That car rapping pun is A+
Wheres Dio when you need him 😂
10:33 she really decided to recreate dance moms with a bunch of clones of herself 💀💀💀
I absolutely love KISS. The fact she looks like a bad girls-toy copy from ToysR'us and that she has zero idea who Gene Simmons is should put her on a CIA OR FBI list
Enemy stand user ahh fit
Way too many dramatic scenarios for my blood. I'm out.
JoJo Siwa forgets the child actor from "Terminator 2." He was a cute kid who became a drug addict. Pretty sweet transition.
We can all conclude... She just got hit by a boomerang
The only way Jojo can convince me she's an adult is if she addresses and apologizes for her mistreatment of the young girls on her XOMG show. An adult faces the consequences of their actions.
All of her interviews just give me massive migraines, the human reverse Tylenol
Ngl the straight bullying she getting rn for what she did to that song might actually put her in an edgy phase
She has stolen JoJo from the JoJoheads
Can’t lie you remind me of 2016 Emma Blackery
Harvey???
Chad Chad breaking her knee while practicing Jojo's choreo gave me the ick. I think I'm going to unsubscribe...
Girl Turned Billy eillish
Didnt know there was a secret Kiss member!
9:46 Avatar: The Last Airdancer
the whole "rebrand" is like if disney did edgy.
If I were her, I’d actually bring emo back. With the trend recycle reaching the early naughts, I feel the scene look will eventually come back yassified. It’d fit her colourful look, she’d speed up the trend rebirth while doing something on the fringe aka literally actually edgy, and she’d set herself apart from the yassified country and pop markets.
Here I was clicking on one of your videos instead of aaaaall the videos that are on here and then there's no 'thank you'? I guess JoJo's bad rubbed off on you :(
she went through her emo phase a little late 😭🙏
I am having a hard time with his video. This is way more than a twinge.
She looks like a Disney pro wrestler. Her taste level is that of a midwestern tween boy oh the yung lesbian of it all  Let’s not be harsh on her let’s normalise women NOT having a sense of style or fashion
Jojo’s bizarre adventure reference RAAAAAHHHHH
The fact that her ears aren't even pierced and she just glues rhinestones on them.... a bad girl yes.
12:06 lets go SIWAt all the fuss is about👀
raycon these nutz
The thing is, her song is copy and paste song bro💀
Was that a mother fucking jojo’s referance? (I’m sorry guys I had to )
Jojo joined the dark side 💀
Im pretty sure the creators of Bojack Horseman took inspiration from Jojo Siwa to create the Sarah Lynn character. Cause since I 've watch Bojack, now whenever I see Jojo I just think......Sarah Lynn.
Is it me or does it sound like never gonna give you up
this video was a masterpiece, thank you for making me laughcry into my 4am chicken sammich godbless
The funniest part about this is that the song she's releasing isn't even hers it's been released since like 2012😭
shes giving michael scott energy
her acting like she's pioneering gay pop just takes away from queer artists who've been doing this since she was shitting in diapers
There's something so gross about having your mom dictate and prescribe your lesbian glam rock phase. I remember when it was Miley twerking at least it felt like a genuine escape from her Disney persona , this just feels like she's still doing whatever Mom says.
Scariest thing about her is that hairline 😂
Ironic that she's trying to show her maturity by acting incredibly immature.
Chadchad did the dance better
I am loving this Chad Chad the Last Airbender, though
Being an adult, I’ve never given a shit about Jojo. But being someone that left the church ages ago, I can’t help but recognize this level of try-hard.
Oh god SHES APPROACHED TEENHOOD
7:07 real
I didn't know who Jojo Siwa was until like 3 days ago.. Luckily I can go listen to more AlphaWhores to purge this from my mind 😵
I literally like the original  jojo siwa
She looks like a WWE wrestler and a rhytmic gymnasts decided to have a baby that is now simultaneously going through puberty and a midlife crisis. 💀
harvey from stardew valley mention!!!!!
Omg, you made me laugh soooo much with that ending!!! 🤣🤣🤣
If she was uncomfortable to sing lyrics on her own song then isn't that just admitting that you don't write these songs, don't believe in the message, aren't actually expressing yourself? Like how could something that's honestly coming from you, as an artist, be something you're uncomfortable with? I mean nobody has accused Siwa of being original but this is just embarassing how many times we've seen young pop stars make this exact same pivot.
JOJOS BIZZARE ADVENTURE MENTIONED RAAAAH 10:25 🗣️🗣️‼️‼️‼️
0:10 what is she saying.
Chad Chad got me dieing😂
Ayo gurl I'm digging that shirt ❤
I don't know any Siwas but I sure as hell hate her voice, so fucking bad
That hurt to watch  🙀🙀🙀
Uh I guess it's giving Steve from Blue's Clues doing his own music?? It's jarring because she's a preschool entertainer who was only ever seen in costume and in character. Like if The Wiggles started doing adult entertainment still as The Wiggles. Miley still acted and dressed like a teenager on and off the show, even if the target demographic was younger than that.
As a kid you don't care what people think about your hobbies. Around 12-16 you become obsessed and start downplaying the 'childish' things you like to look cooler to other people. At 18 on you stop caring what people think and start watching cartoon and playing pokemon games again. She is stuck in the 15 year old mindset of what they think an adult is. Adults are not edgy. Adults watch John Wick after watching Bluey. She has no balance. It is so forced and cringe. There is nothing wrong with being an icon for kids. Especially when adults cringe at your attempts to be edgy.
It seems like she's trying to do grunge, but she doesn't know what grunge is.  She kinda just looks like the cartoon version of an 80s goth kid.
Imagine how much worse it would’ve been if JoJo had actually written the song
the bending lmao
I’m more edgier than her on a Tuesday afternoon in a Arby’s parking lot with a #3
I can no longer take you seriously, chad chad. Your actions are abhorrent, and I cannot stand by you any longer while you attempt to romance objectively the worst bachelor in Stardew Valley. Consider me no longer a fan.
And now she’s getting exposed for this not even being her own song lmao. It’s just a copy of an unreleased song from years ago.
Female Jake Paul?
fun fact: I was watching this video while giving Harvey smooches on Stardew Valley 🤭
Listens to black metal once
That’s why yo knee hart
Chad Chad don’t talk about my mom
based harvey lover
0:47 almost choked on my food ! "as I could only described as the human form of a lightstick.." 😂😂 Chad chad is always spot on for comparaison 😂
She Belongs in the band KISS! 💀
Her lack of self-awareness is a little bit sad, to be honest. She really believes she's cool as hell. 😢
Cringe!😂
She made that drastic of a change because she realized that she isn’t enough…..
The stop car rapping had me dying 😂
hi this is actually me, the other one was my little cousin billy. I think what he meant was that the while the content of the video was entertaining because of the overly detailed, deadpan description of trivial internet drama, the captivating thing about the video was the eye candy. keep on and where's the outro?
9:55  the effects for the dance is SLAYING
JoJo looks like a spooky Halloween themed Twinkie.
yes. video good. reinforcing words
It's giving the bully kid from Cool Cat Saves the Kids saying "It's time to punk up"
chad chad…why harvey tho. just….why. he has taken so much money from me. if i were to smooch him id he would charge me for that too :(
wtf is dance moms??? you blew past that like its something everyone knows. i have never heard of this. is it a reality show where moms are dancing?? i don't even want to look it up because it can't possibly be as entertaining as what i'm imagining it is.
Hahaha I love your videos! They're so much fun and so entertaining!
8:07 I died laughing
I *love* the video! Nothing but quality and funny jokes while dishing out facts. I got one small funny moment I had with the video, and that was at 5:14. I literally did a double-take as soon as I recognized ‘SHIT THAT’S A TF2 TRACK’. I had to go back and rewatch when that started playing bc the brainworms took over for the entirety of the track lol. I AM IN TOO DEEP IN THE TF2 RABBIT HOLE-
"I wanna create gaypop" girl that's called hyperpop
I bet not even Kidz Bop would wanna make a remix of Karma T-T
I thought former Disney Stars were Lords of the Edge. I guess former child reality tv stars turned child influencers are the new Cliffhangers.
Went from Bang Energy to Monster
This is how my 12 year old acted years ago. 🤦‍♀️
you freaking owned thayt tdance like a boss!! ❤️💦⛹️‍♀️✌️🈵️🈵️🈵️😇
I hate that her video came out on my birthday. If you're reading this, Jojo: I debuted first.
she reminds me of that one punk troll in trolls world tour r
I didn't even know who this girl was or that she existed until today, now I'm just upset.
When trying hard doesn't try hard enough.
Next thing you know she’s gonna start talking about reconstructing the rings of Saturn without gravity
The video is so boring wtf was she talking about
Tf??? Chad Chad is a TF2 fan???
wait till chad chad finds out jojo stole the song and didnt write it herself, and she in fact stole it from Brit Smith
Yes another Harvey girl❤
8:54 actually insane. my dad wanted to NAME me after Gene Simmons
I thought you were Kallmekris for a moment. I apologize for not realizing.
She's still behaving like a child, where's the bad part?? 🤣 I think her singing on her car was more scary 🤣🤣
you'd think with amount of groomers she's friends with she'd be great at not kid friendly but here we are
chad chad not late to a trend for once!!! (LMAO love u)
She needs to be pulled away from her mother. She just screams abusive parents with an iron grip on her. Her mum put her on a show where they run them ragged and try to make them cry for camera. Of course she thinks thats normal. She hasn't had any opportunities to grow up and had none to be a kid. She is a doll to dress up for her parents  and she has said that herself. She is a victim of severe childhood abuse and it's definitely still happening. I seriously doubt she made this decision or any real decision ever. People should not be able to exploit their children at all let alone into their adulthood.
gay pop is just bicycle race by queen
Shane Dawson was a jump scare 💀
i really appreciate commentary ytbers mentioning the xomg pop group because too many people are talking about the cringe only and not the CRIMES!
growing up as a queer kid, jojo being sapphic was earth shattering. she was just the same jojo as ever; she was still pretty and kind and colorful. i didn’t have to change, i wasn’t a bad person for being gay. so for jojo’s new rebrand to be every homophobic mom’s idea of a lesbian… ooh. ouchhie ouchh
11:28 the fact that her idea of edgy is just holding a giant co*k Is so funny
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, that's why a balding blonde girl keeps popping up on my pinterest, never heard or searched about her... I was better that way... anyways, thank you !!!  :)
The car rapping 😂
Karma Dance Practice [Mirrored] [Chad Chad focus]
I knew this day would come...
@chadchad is this women single I can on.y hope cuz she gets me inside my mind now JOJO idk wtf amount of adderal n Prozac did her doctor fill her up with
psycho...psychotic
HELP WHY DID I START STROKING IT 😂🙏🙏🙏
JoJo: "I was a bad girl"   *Unicorn Bows Left The Chat*
Where do people get this idea that being a badass will earn the respect of others? It doesn’t. It was passé and played out by 2012. The need for badassery is now just a clear symptom of insecurity. How about just being a good, kind person? She’ll get far more respect and widespread appreciation that way, instead of looking like a needy clown.
Child star to adult star😭🙏🏼
She didn’t even write Karma as far as I am aware
Post more videos u shit I want more entertainment
So not an obscure anime show? Okay, good to know.
i love the tf2 music
Your walls are disturbingly bare
Your cover was fiiiire, Chad Chad 😂
Not this being chad chad’s 69 video 💀
If I could subscribe twice I would just for the jojos reference
Another masterpiece ✨️
I wAs a BaD gIrL
Jojo talking about being gay the same way, Lily Singh talks about being a bi woman of color.  Her immediate change to a would be edgy persona is hilarious  🤣
Walmart Gene Simmons is just rebranding her image and style to distract from the abuse allegations. And the scary thing is, it's working, because the bad music and bad taste clothing are what people are talking about now.
I didn't think it was possible for her to be any more ridiculous than she already was.
Avatar Chad Chad 9:47
We need a Chad Chad dance channel
Honestly her ponytail was tided too tight at a kid so now she has a receding hairline and a brain injury 💀
I'm sorry but in Stardew, Alex > Harvey
i only knew now that jojo has interacted with child predators. i sorta hate her more now. in the time where she was a super popular child star, i only hated her neon aesthetic, didn’t think she’d support these disgusting people..
This has been my favourite "twinge of cringe" intro. Idk why the nonchalance of it was hilarious
Harvey stardew valley <3
I laughed so hard because the ad that came up during this video was for therapy
You know what, at least she’s not blackfishing to escape the child star trap so I guess it’s not awful. But cosplaying as Gene Simmons and not knowing anything about him or KISS is pretty insane.
Let me be the optimized gel tips to your heart
Jojo 's video for "Kar crush"  I'm sorry meant Karma wasn't "Edgy" at all it was just laughable ,
9:35 nice moves chad chad
YES another Harvey girl 😌
1:17 Dance Moms in a nutshell
Its a general mess. Nearly every route or alternative definitively spirals out of entropy.  Sociologoically speaking the rate at which intellectually mooring within a structure related to exemplar consistent, neurotypical behaviour is inexhausting due to caloric restricted forms of various microbe based colonisations. Meatbags? Anyone?
the fnaf vhs tapes with the bandaid over it😃 (11:01)
Chad you jumped the gun! The Brit  Smith stuff is crazy
😂😂😂😂
aint even her song literally stole it word for word bar for bar from a singer named brit smith
chad chad is the best song impersonator ever
The fact that this is an unreleased Miley Cyrus song that she bought the rights to makes the "I'm the first child star to ever do this" comments just absolute gold.
Jojo: "No one has made THIS drastic of a change before"  Me: Miley Cyrus?
I was a bad girl 😞😞😞😞😞
I have a strong desire to be thanked for watching this video out of all the videos out there
12:22 caught me so off guard 😭
why does she sound like she smokes 10 packs of cigs a day
I love you chad chad
Her interviews about the album look and sound like a middle schooler playing pretend as a “pop star”
as a lesbian i dont know how I feel about her hahaha
I just about broke down in tears when Chad Chad said-f-f-f-f FIDDLESTICKS 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Its gonna be theeeee Halloween costume of 2024
i hate this as much as everyone else, but the way people are acting about jojo just barely doing some humping you would think itd be more sexual than WAP
Edgy would be opening up about her mom's abuse. And how she first reacted when JoJo came out to her. The editing in this is phenomenal btw
Am I the only one who thinks Jojo Siwa is just another dipshit artist that started as a plant in the industry when she was young?
"Oh ok im 20 now so i can be sexual"
Jojo's style change has the same energy as the member from 5 finger death punch who started Psycho Sinner
Chad Chad kinda gas. Moist meter going up thanks Charles Mingus
Dont really care for the topic, just love the TF2 soundtrack in the video <3
HARVEY?!?!
Jojo gone wild nahh more like jojo gone mild
What's more exploitative, dances moms or Lizzo?
wow that didn't work at all
The Harvey part caught me off guard, but boy do I agree
So… fluorescent black. I don’t see the change tbh 😂
Harvey love is so real
00:06:12 STANLEY PARABLE NUSIX!!!!!!!!
00:04:53 Undertale jumpscare
jojo wasn't having a bizarre adventure, she was ON the "Bizarre Adventure." 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Have you heard about the nair hair removal guy??? Man literaly showed his ass hole 5 seconds in video and its still on youtube. He also has allegations against minors and animals(his cat)
Sorry, but no...? She is 20 y o, her brain didnt fully develop, and wont for a long time cause she was raised in an abusive way.
9:05 gasped. paused the video. let it process for 4 seconds staring at the screen. "me too..............." longingly. harvey my one true love (the one bit is a lie because i am a homie hopper !)
She looks like she’s part of KISS lol
I don’t think I’ve seen anyone have an emo phase in their 20’s
Ngl we alr have too many songs with the same tittle so adding another “karma” rlly isn’t helping 💀
I will NOT allow such a comparison between Karma Jojo and Kiss, absolutely not, let Kiss be 😔
God damn it Chad you made me cackle out loud several times and now I look like a freak 😠
The extreme bedaz😮
The look the newscaster gave her.
She's a disgrace to gays everywhere
The worst part was how jojo didn’t even make the song.
Don’t forget she actually stole the song 😬
Not even Speedwagon can help that JoJo 😅
for a "singer" she has such an unpleasant voice to listen to
You didn't thank me for not skipping the ad I skipped :(
YEAH HARVEYYY! knew i followed u for a reason lmfao
10:03
Hey deer, ❤ ... ready to get comfy for a decent roll of laughter ..love your vids!
she did all this “promoting” when it wasn’t even her original song to begin with
She got them Avatar Last Airbender ahh moves dawg 😭
Jojo went from 😌to 👹
6:20 The dance in very fast motion 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 10:32 Same dance in ultra fast motion 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She's a fucking genius.  I'm on board.   Gay pop is amazing.
This is the most Eurovision song to come out of the USA
“I was a bagel”
Even her fans dont like her song or her weird existence lately
The cringe era
Famous child with a Claire's Accessories aesthetic becoming an entry level edgelord musician has been done so many times. Its such a specific rebranding move it should have its own name.
i think the reason her rebrand isn’t landing is because all of her “rebellious” and “edgy” actions are preplanned and rehearsed. usually when former child stars have an adult rebrand it’s unexpected and messy. they don’t go into it thinking it’s a phase, but she’s voiced multiple times that this is her bad girl phase, so hers just feels forced and inauthentic.
Isn’t that the girl who was a ballerina or something other with dancing who had such a tight bun that she started to  loose part of her hair?
Looking like a failed villain concept for the Power Rangers
Gay pop is already here and Chappell Roan is the Queen of it. Her album is AMAZING!
ANOTHER HARVEY LOVER <3
69th video of Chadchad
Karma - JoJo Siwa for just dance 2025!!!!
What’s been on my mind the last 3 days? Kissing Lae’zel baldurs gate on the lips🤤🥴
12:05 "let's go SIWA-t all the fuss is about"
Oh
The first dance of the chorus was actually good, it’s where the second and throughout happens that sucks, plus she didn’t even write the song, she bought it from Brit smith
why harvey?
This has very "coming of age" energy. Slightly egotistical, a little naive, but I hope it's all what Jojo'a actually feeling and I hope people don't hate on her too hard for being immature when she's literally, biologically and socially, still maturing. It'd be a real shame if this was a cynical rebrand driven by her mom, but honestly I could see myself doing the same thing at her age.  You wanna make yourself an event because you wanna feel important and define yourself, you wanna push edges that are only edges in your own narrow framework, you wanna think your inventing the wheel when you're actually going through the same stuff as others, you wanna dedicate yourself completely to whatever project you think is like meaningful, I was the same way! All that is obviously gonna be pretty embarassing and cringey, but I mean that's growing up. Plus, this all is likely exacerbated by being a child star and all.  Jojo is my preteen niece's bi representation, and I just hope that she doesn't get needlessly raked through the coals for perfectly normal, silly, behavior like a lot of other famous girls transitioning to adulthood. Unless she's actively doing anything that could harm human or nonhuman animals, I honestly just wanna support her. Her sense of fun, energy, and even purpose was infectious in this video for me, and I'd be perfectly happy if my niece was as excited about Jojo's new turn as Jojo is. Might have to have a couple odd conversations about sexuality lol, but she'll be a teenager soon so that's coming anyways.
Little children are gone look up their favourite artist to see what she’s been up to and see this shit, she’s doomed our generation and the next
Okay but yeah Harvey >>> everyone
Holy shit u need to make yourself a background set for your videos lmao it looks awful I love your videos but I never realized how bad the room is till now 😂
From the beginning im happy to see how far youve made it thank you for all the good videos
She's in her Miley Cyrus era, pressure to be one way got to her and now she's rebelling against it lol
Why does she sound like Donald Trump? "No one else is doing what I'm doing'
9:11 hell yea harvey time
I've seen so many videos of people talking about Jojo Siwa's new music video - it's insane. I had no idea who she was before this. All this information is absolutely useless to me but I'm addicted somebody HELP
homegirl in the room by herself: “cut the cameras!”
me watching chad chad dance while recovering from a knee injury  💀
Love your humor and editing!
Hate JoJo and her mom so much. Only watched Dance Moms this year and omfg she’s actually just always been awful. “She was a kid” okay and she literally hasn’t changed is the problem. I will judge her past self on her current sins idc. And her mom is also just awful.
Imagine Radiohead promoted KID A like this
I had this song stuck in my head while taking the ACT 💀💀💀
Kinda looks like she applied for WWE
Cool, they turned Fortnite into a song
I fee like being big and famous as a child ruins people when they get older. Honestly makes me feel bad for JoJo
HOLY SHIT THE AVATAR BENDING SLAUGHTERED ME. ACTUALLY LOLLED
"i WaS a BaD gIrL" What did u do steal a candy bar?
Jojo to emo
As a death metal fan, the idea a pop musician is able to even enter the realm of being edgy is the silliest shit I've ever heard.
She's a psycho all right... a Psycho Circus!
Why does it look like she never grew up?
Really hurt to see you flex on your fans by dancing with such swag Chad. I hope you find the right path 🙏
u became an airbender for a second
She’s just female Ryan trahan💀
Before I was like, "okay it's a bit cringe but the look is not THAT bad, let her live". But now you've shown me her personality and holy shit I was not expecting that. I honestly can't believe she's 20, she acts like an out of touch cringy 35 year old IRL redditor or the platonic archetype of a Marvel comedy relief side character
The avatar is among us 😮 9:45
she's trying to be on top again but she's never getting the fame
The crazy part is she didn't even write the song herself
this isnt joja siwa, this is joja mart
had to instantly like at the JoJo reference
So JoJo, why would miley be part of queer pop? I think thats just a straight cis woman. 😂
it isnt even her song
*Claims to be an edgy adult punk now* *Hasn’t even smoked pot in public once*
U look like Miley Bobby brown
She sounds like she smokes a pack of cigarettes everyday 💀
See you next month chad chad 😭
Jojo's recent "rebrand" is terribly cringe but I also do feel a little bad for her. She's pretty clearly just going through what people usually do when they're like fourteen or fifteen years old, but a lack of a free and unstructured childhood and adolescence never let her experience that. So now she's having her early teenage edgy phase at age twenty.
Also Jojo is gay
She is not feminine or graceful. She would have done well if she took the Pink route. Pink has been the badass rockstar chick and it was an amazing contrast next to the sexy blonde Britney image (who I love btw). But JoJo is making it cringe
PLS THE BENDING HAS ME IN TEARS
This ain't jojos bizarre adventure. This is.. Jojo's mildly interesting Saturday night.
what the fritch where is thaaaank you aaand buy huh
"I want to invent a new genre of music, and I call it gay pop." You're...like fifteen years too late, sis.
Stardew valley is based
I know that you somehow need to keep this channel going but commenting on people who are just doing a harmless thing for 15 minutes is by now an outdated and frankly boring thing to do online
2:16 Damn, i never thought Jojo would take it this far
This looks like the Beatdown Biddies rebranding into the Toxic Twins in GLOW. This is 100% a wrestling outfit.
You ✨️SLAYED✨️ this dance.
Tbh im so biased but romancing Harvey from SDV is peak taste 🙏
Find another chad chad isn’t always confident like a goddess is insane because she literally could be a classic Hollywood beauty
What is the beginning of Cameron transition transition from child star to adult literally leafed nudes like I’m not saying that’s right or anything but I don’t know people have taken harder turns before jojo lol
JoJo is giving, "I just smoked a cigarette, and MAN AM I HIGH" energy.
damn i didn't know chadchad was the avatar
My first time seeing jojo’s new look made me think that her glamorous rhinestone self was trampled in a mosh pit and came out a KISS wannabe punk rockstar
Jojos siwas
she’s trying to do what lil nas x did fr
Ngl she looks like the members of Kiss made a collaboration with My Little Pony.
Always hated raycon ads till someone gave me a pair, and they fit better than any other earbuds and sound quality is good. Was really surprised
Because of the timing and everything I'm pretty sure JoJo's rebrand is actually just to cover up how she and Abby were treating the girls in OMG pop
i like the lil' remix at the end better than the original song
Sorry but u look kinda like simply kenna
The new outfit is giving "FInnish pop metal Eurovision entry"
9:12 BABYGIRL MENTIONED I LOVE HARVEY WHAT THE FCK IS GOING OUTSIDE
she is the avatar 9:46
No way she said “no one has made this dramatic of a change/extreme of switch” WHILE WEARING NEON RHINESTONES AND A HIGH PONYTAIL. Jojo be fucking for real. Honestly it’s probably all ragebait to distract from the XOMGPop controversies
Jojo lost millions of subs just because of this change (2020-10mil+ 2024-200k+) so yeah it was her fault for posted the music ( I don’t like Jojo just btw) Edit - I’m using raycon rn
9:08 is the most relatable moment i have ever seen in a youtube video in my entire whole life i swear-
8:29 WHOS DUN IT oh MY GOD IM SCREAMING CRYING RN YOU JAVE NO IDEA HOW SHOCKED I WAS TO HEAR THIS SONG🙏🙏🙏🙏🎉🎉🎉
3:00 no it’s actually the same genre gacha kids in 2018 used for their edgy half demon half angel videos
I think that the whole extreme makeover comments from Jojo are meant to read: okay I'm a bi/lesbian baddie and noone did this before. She's marketing her cheating scandals a lot and most of the previous child stars were streaight.
i did not even know her before this stuff but Icould still not take her seriously as "edgy"
she is saying like she’s the main character in every Disney channel movie/series
1.4 million views in two days? Sis fell off, smh...
Old jojo is color tv version and new jojo is black and  white tv
Chad Chad flunked the outro AGAIN!!
She's so quirky 🤪🥰🤩🥳🤤😔😙😛🥹😗🤣😭😃
She's doing a Dove Cameron, but worse
Fucking finally some Harvey recognition here
Thank you for not saying you're going to call it there. It's always unsettling to me.
She’s having a great time with her new found invisible boomerang🪃 !!!
I think after a while of a lot of people on the internet just seeing her as bows and sparkles, she might've wanted to go for a mature style of music or a more mature asthetic (like Lana has or Mitski where it's nothing too adult but it's also not something a five year old casually listens to) but maybe her team ir her mom Idk thought that it wouldn't make a big impact and so just to get people talking about it they had her do this (and look at how many views she has gotten and how many people are talking about her) (plus isn't the guy from KISS suing her?? (I heard it somewhere))   Or maybe you're right and her mom was the main person behind this idea.   Or maybe her team/mom we're  concerned that the internet was starting to forget her  But I recently saw a video where she was like "oh me and Colleen Ballinger have been friends since I was like 12 and she's a good person" which um... Jojo... that's not normal...   I have a few concerns...
TEAM FORTRESS 2 SOUNDTRACK MENTION 5:15
Remember the original pre teen singer named JoJo?.
That light behind you makes it look like you have a pair of pink horns. Wonderful, pink horns.
Ewww so cringe to see the ego this girl has. She tried to pull a Hannah Montana - Miley Cyrus transformation and failed miserably
it’s giving going from elementary school to middle school
Gene Simmons is on the phone with his lawyer, ask Abbath he’ll tell ya.😉
As cringe as it might be, if the goal is to get clout it's working big time. I haven't heard anything from this girl in years and now I see posts about her everywhere.
It's so hard to listen to her, the second hand embarrassment is unreal.
I listened to it and I realised that it is good, just underhyped by the audience and overhyped by the singer
12:23
Quite frankly I think she’s fucking annoying. But if I were to armchair psychologist this shi id say she’s been so stunted and held back in such a childish persona. Which I think has caused her to misinterpret or have this picture in her mind of what’s “edgy and rebellious”. Which imo even has a “child television star” interpretation of edgy. where in actual reality it’s kind of cringe.  Either that or her mother’s ideas. I hope it’s her mother’s ideas. This whole situation has given me secondhand embarrassment.
its like shes pretending to be emo/alt
of course you like pickle boy harvey
I think you should release this version of the song
Her edgy new era is called "Goldust" from the wwe
There should be a kidzbop version of this. Also sang by jojo.
Get That dog out of that cage what the heeeeeelllllll
Omg you look EXACTLY like KMK !!! 😍. WOWWWW 💜
User: JoJo Stand: kiss
I did my local theaters dance troupe for like 6 years and while it's not an exact 1 = 1 you do NOT need MULTIPLE 12 hours of rehersals. At some point you get tired and ur wasting ur time if not hurting yourself. I feel bad for whoever pushed jojo to believe 12 hour rehersals is a good thing. And I feel worse for the dancers who have to do those rehersals with her
She went from a 6yo girly girl aesthetic to what a 6yo would imagine an "adult bad girl" looks like.
No this is her WWE Star Dust era😂
its unfortunate that so many child stars end up making these transitions so rapidly. jojos audience is aging at the same rate as her; im sure in a vacuum, her art and aesthetic would age with her. theres a place for girlypop bedazzle-everything adults in culture. but it isnt a vacuum -- i suspect that these brand moves are being influenced by people twice or thrice her age, and are viewing her and her art as frozen in time just because their own lives slowed down as they got old.
"i was a bad girl"  no shit you aren't
She has no clue who Gene Simmons is....joke is on her, I have no clue who she is. 😅
She needs to stop drinking coffee....
idk if she's just full child star brain rotted, where she doesn't know what's true or not about her own life anymore, or if she's just an incredible troll. I can't imagine a self-proclaimed homosexual saying "I'm going to invent a new genre: gay pop" unironically. She kind of feels like the kidz bop version of Gia Gunn- "no one has done a transformation this dramatic before" is Gia Gunn-coded.
"So nobody was talking about the music video, but I was hoping they would, so I'm gonna talk about the music video..."
9:12 HARVEY??? He's the guy to marry you and still charge you if you take his yoghurt from the fridge
bro you look like a fucking sim in front of the TV i can’t 😭💀
I knew you'd be a Harvey girly.
You forgot to mention its an exact copy of Brit Smith's except it sounds a lot worse.
You had me at Jojo reference
is this a jojos reference?
At least she is not fondling kids, whitch puts her in top 10% of all celebrities right of the bat
She’s gonna look at this and cringe so bad
oh there’s something so much creepier about a “rebellion” orchestrated by your mom. like the whole thing is massively inauthentic but the idea that it’s her mom being like “okay now you’re gonna wear a see-through leotard and hump someone” instead of her making her own decisions is genuinely really upsetting.
chad chad jjba stan?
Isn't fun how this is after she was accused of being awful to the children she had working on her competition show. Crazy.
Why is the female child star to ‘bad girl’ transformations just some uninspired lazily skimpy ‘objectify me’ costume? Stop being the typical ‘bad girl’ and do something actually creative, not just ‘sexy’ if you can even call it that 🤮
you're SO wrong for picking Harvey. (Haley all the way)
Golly gee.     Sorry about that.
I genuinely feel bad for her, she was cyberbullied all her life and it is skyrocketing now
lmao pick me girl youtubers are a thing now?
mom is great at the most evil marketing
im gonna choose to just focus on the fact this video is mostly humor (and it makes it better)  11:36 I HAVE THAT DINO STUFFY
Ok, what sing is she stealing, this time?
Oh, I guess you're not glad I clicked on this video out of alllll the other videos? Okay then. :(

9:11 is so real
Looks like she's trying to create her WWE persona
You wanna look into my mind
The fact she doesnt even know who Gene SImmons is while wearing( a bad version of what) makeup he's known for..... i ...... lmfao... girl...
Hi Chad
Chad Chad dancing on video was not on my bingo card for 2024😂 it’s not even June guys 😂
I agree that this attempted rebeand is cringey, but I also hope the internet treats her with a little more grace than they did with, say, Miley Cyrus circa THAT year's VMA's performance and the whole wrecking ball era. I think her fame and child star identity are magnifying her cringe phase and broadcasting it to the world, but how many people don't go through a cringe phase quite frankly, and are just lucky enough not to have a mom trying to monetize it? Everything, down to the way she acts like she's inventing all of this stuff, is classic preteen/adolescent cringe, but she's experiencing it later because she never had the chance when it was age appropriate, and even then it wouldn't have been private and would have been blown up into a big thing. And yeah, other child stars didn't go through this big of a failed rebrand, but their appeal didn't lie in over the top childishness - they were just children starring in content for children. I guess my point is, every action has an equal, opposite reaction, but Jojo doesn't realize how far she's going to swing before she hits the other side. Because ultimately, she never got the chance to find her own identity - hers has only ever been crafted for the media, and I think that's a shame
Omg… I love Harvey too!
Am I the only one that thinks she looks like Lana Del Ray?
"Fiddle Sticks" funny 😂
stardew valley mentioned
Why does JoJo have the voice of a 50 year old life long smoker as a 20 year old?
damn this gurl really said "i was a bad girl"
dont bring the joestar family into this..
12:43 yessss girl give us something no one in this generation has ever done before!!!
oh the music video's crazy alright 💀
yall wanna talk abt change lets talk abt Melanie Martinez  THE QUEEN OF CHANGE!!!!!!!
9:09 FINALLY another harvey lover, only man in that game who would treat you right
"then what's been stuck in your head" NOT YOUR SONG GIRL 💀 not her trying to eat with a stolen song 😭
I NEVER SEE ENOUGH HARVEY LOVE #MYHUSBANDDDD
jojo is as edgy as a school pencil the teacher gave you
She’s desperately trying to deflect from the abuse she’s inflicted upon other children.   She’s a grown woman. Not a child.   And defends her predator friends
Abigail is clearly the correct choice for romancing in Stardew Valley
Jojo’s Wacky Fun Time
YESSSS HARVEY SUPREMACY
where did you get that shirt?
that music video is traumatizing 😭
Me watching this video wondering how you get your dog to chill in its kennel. Maybe it’s a breed thing, but my chihuahua would NEVER.
all the talk about how she wrote these songs only for it to come out that she did not in fact write these songs
Watch her go completely crazy and just get naked to some generic pop bs.
Jojo: I was scared to say effed  Me: *literally couldn't go 10 minutes without cursing in middle school* (I was actually the good kid surprisingly)
She has the same mannerisms and way of speaking as Donald trump
No! That is NOT solid snake!
And the fact that this song ALREADY exists, word to word
Girl needs a color grade
I read a comment somewhere that this is what happens when you give a home schooled kid a candy bar.
i'm going to be honest, i feel bad for jojo. it couldn't have been easy sacrificing years of your adulthood to play this plasticky, fake version of yourself. and though i feel  like she's forcing this rebrand on herself, she is technically an adult and can do whatever the heck she wants. if she feels this is what can break her out of her shell and explore the "new her", she's completely entitled to that.
i didn't know there was a market for edgy content for 8 year olds.
Christina Aguilera,  Miley Cyrus did it better.....
Calling KISS "hip" and "current" band like theyre not older than my actual mother 😂 are they still making music actually? Wouldnt they be in their 60's or 70's depending on their age when the band started?
Why no hand tracking! change scares me and makes me sad!
GIRL there is barely another soul on youtube who can make me laugh as much as you do >.< lmaooooo your editing and humor >>>>>>>>>
It’s not her song she stole the whole thing
Dude, you're the best really
I feel like Jojo saw Lil Nas X do his whole thing from being the old town road guy to a bonafide gay pop icon with flashy themed outfits and controversial music videos and went “i should try that” and fumbled the bag so badly
All singers got that demonic era
Does anyone agree with me that the interviewers and podcasters only interact with her to hear and see the insanity of her spiralling. Kinda sad but she also needs to chill tf out. I can’t imagine how awkward this is gonna be for her in a few years
oh no Jojo's reputation era 😱
Raycon sucks
I'm confused. Why is Britney Spears cosplaying as Gene Simmons?
“No one has made this dramatic of a change yet” she says covered in sparkles and glitter 💀
This is the EXACT video I've been waiting for
She's gone full Gene Simmons.
JoJo thinks that it’s the music and the music video being “extreme” that got ppls attention but it’s just more so that we can’t believe that it took a professional choreographer and 3 songwriters to come up with the worst combo of lyrics and dance moves ever and that she didn’t just come up with everything  in her closet by herself
She has no personality
Wait so she said she wanted to spearhead Gay Pop and proceeded to list off three existing examples of Gay Pop?
Ngl, that song is kinda a bop.
Harvey???
She looks like she says IT’S NOT A FAZE MOM
YIPEE STARDEW VALLEY
ChadChad doing the dance has me weak😭😭
This is the 2009 version of "rebel"
Jojo is just pulling the Robin Sparkles
Those teeth though 😂😂😂😂
This is just a publicity stunt. like she defo knows what's she doing and its working she's relevant again.
New genre💀  I’m a rebel🤓☝️face ass
this is why only one good jojo can exist and it's me
THE HARVEY REP!!!!!!!!!!!
Fun fact Jojo stole her song “Karma” from Brit Smiths “Karmas A B*tch” ITS LITERALLY THE EXACT SAME LYRICS!!!!!
Aww I feel bad for her. She just wants to make some music and be taken seriously 😢
I miss the old jojo😢
Chad Chad you should be a rapper that eminen verse was fire
anxiously waiting her “going to the psychiatrist and treating myself” girl era 🎉🫠❤️🩷👏🏻🤝🏻🙏🏻🫶🏻
she sounds like steavo i cant get that out of my head
Jojo has been changing lately😭
THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING ABOUT LEIGHA, SHE DOESNT EVER GET SPOKEN ABOUT WHEN PPL BRING UP JOJO NOWADAYS THANK YOU SO MUCH I FEEL SO BAD FOR HER..
would love to see you do a whole video on dance moms tbh. its a crazy show im fascinated what was essentially just broadcast child abuse was on the air for so long
You're like butters from south park but if he was funny on porpoise
She’s acting like the video is as controversial or artistic as lady Gagas Alejandro or Judas
Girlie is trying to submit an application for KISS
Her makeup was a straight copy of KISS
If she released a normal pop album I’d probably be on board. I love the pop girls at the moment and they’d probably welcome her with open arms. This is just sad
9:45 long ago the four nations lived together in harmony but everything changed when the fire nation attacked
So much second hand embarrassment omg 😭  9:11 is so real btw (the stardew bachelors/bachelorettes are so fine)
Also why is no-one talking about how this entire song is literally stolen. It's a Brit Smith song from 2012. Jojo did not write this. What a bad girl.
She straight up stole this song too
can you send me the link to find that picture of the old man going like 🤫 right before the sponsor
I like your song better lol
Edgy era more like demonic era, girl looking like a jack-o’-lantern you can’t tell me that she doesn’t look like a jack-o’-lantern like FRFR🙄🙄🙄🙄🪳🪳🪳🍟🎃🎃
12:05 More like *Siwat's* happening, am i right???
"Its called gay pop" (proceeds to share songs by straight women)
5:23 "A little heart to heart" from tf2 in the back while jojo is talking about her rebrand!! im screaming! 😂😭
The Cody Ko audio 😂😂
I don't blame jojo for the out of touch reality she's in. It sounds the people around her how made her believe a reality that isn't real. Possibly even making her believe it revolves around her. When you grow up with that, you don't know any different
The new look seems like a someone going to a KISS cover band concert.
Jo Jo is the very definition of EXTRA.
The things I would do to get behind Chad and take a good whiff…
And this is why nobody and I mean NOBODY can beat girl in red.❤
I could have lived without knowing this person existed.
Can we just stop talking about it and let her career die faster?
9:44 “everything changed when the Jojo Nation attacked.”
Well she’d be happy to know my 9 yo doesn’t like her anymore. Not bc she’s for adults but bc she looks a mess.
6:57 LOLLLL the tik tok of her cutting someone off
She's so self-absorbed it's honestly nauseating
This gonna be the most scariest, most differentest, most grown-upness thing you've ever seen!! 🤦‍♀️
House really be lookin like a white torture chamber.
The elements when you were dancing got me😭💀
Its not even hers 😂😂
you’re allowed to retire the ’not really' thing. i absolve u
AHHHHAAA KISSS AND SMOOCHH HARVEY IS SO REAL IM PLAYING STARDEW VALLEY WHOLE MARRIED TO HIM AS I LISTEN TO THIS VIDEO LAMOII
i knew she was gonna say it 0:02
"no one in my generation has made this extreme of a switch-" *silently changes tabs to reveal the trans flag* uh huh, go on,
Tiegan and sara stitched the gay pop tik tok lmao
It's weird that someone who actually seems unhinged is failing at trying to act unhinged
If "trying too hard" was a person
when does the EP of you voice over come up on the Spotify? because that was (( checks notes for what the kids say these days )) lite.
Oh frick, I know who Gene Simmons is but I didn't know who Jojo is.... Now I know, it is someone to avoid.  Thanks for the vid, it was entertaining as usual.
9:11 girl. im sorry. you just lost me. FUCKING HARVEY??????????????????????
Please tell me im not the only one who thinks the weird chin makeup that goes down her neck looks like a beard😭😭😭 WHAT IS THAT THERE FOR
YOU WOULDNT LAST A SECOND IN MY MIND “gosh. Darn. Gee-whizz” amazing
I kept hearing people talk about the music video… let’s just say i should’ve stayed curious 💀
I think JoJo is taking this bizarre adventure too far
The air bending dancing part😂
Chad Chad doesn’t appreciate us for clicking on her video out of aaaaaaall the videos on here FOR THE SECOND TIME
Day 655 of asking Chad Chad to be my girlfriend 😢 I’m a normal cool 26 year old dude just give me a chance
A fellow Harvey enjoyer ✌
That i8 got bars
OMGGG I NAMED MY CAT BONES TOO! I DIDN'T KNO YOUR CAT WAS NAMED BONES! THATS SO COOL!
I think she is trying to rebrand because of the allegations about the girl group she started. I think this is to just focus on her "rebrand" instead of the labor law and child laws she was breaking.
Can we stop making the wrong people famous?
OMG YOU PLAY STARDEW I LOVE IT SO MUCH ITS ADDICTIVE SAM HAS MY HEART BUT HARVEY IS A CUTIE
Another ChadChad banger
the fucking avatar dance moves im cryinggg
it’s not even her song, she bought the demo from someone, it was made 2012 I believe
Everytime i see the costume i ⚰️ a little more inside
Yea she did not come back like a boomerang…….
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A JJBA FAN
She def smoked a lil bud and switched up 💀
Nice shirt
😆Why's it so dark?
"i barely want to see my face at all much less pay thousands to have it plastered on a kia soul" too real
It's just one song...
in her interviews she literally has the same cadence as donald trump lmao, "no one has - in my generation - and i am the first of the genration..."
6:35 you don't wanna be where I was from because if you were from where I was from mf you'd be DEAD
Lol best review of this by far 😂😂😂
"I'm gonna do something no one's ever done before" * proceeds to google Gene Simmons and the entire Kiss wardrobe*
She was humping a tampon a fûcking TAMPON
I actually feel really bad for her. Her life has been publicized since she was in kindergarten. And can you imagine having a mom who was like “hey daughter who is just barely an adult and followed almost entirely by little kids, you know what would be awesome? Humpin’ on camera! Now pose all cute in front of that six shop!” I hope she’s ok.   But also the video feels like the dance equivalent of a kid smashing Barbies together, iykyk.
I watched this video instead of all the other videos that are on here
Avatar Chad Chad we need your help saving the world!
Brotherrrr please, it's too much. The "I'm so edgy" tone and rasp she's added to her voice is killing me.
Let's not get so distracted by this rebrand, and forget that JoJo is friends with and publicly defends child groomers, and has abused children for the sake of TV "drama", to make her more money.
Jojo practically stole the whole song 😩
21 is still so young. I would guess her ma and some kind of professional team have been controlling her decisions for a long time.  She has grown up in the toxic environment of competitive dance - that's her one version of reality. She never had a normal childhood. She wouldn't know what normal is like. Maybe in another 10-20 years she'll have her time to look back and unpack this stuff.
Inventing gay pop… girl, the entire music industry been queer as hell for DECADES. Do you know how fruity artists are??
honestly, the idea of her mother being largely behind this makes this make a lot more sense. she was used by her mother as a child star and clearly personally influenced by her, and unfortunately turning 18 doesn't just end that. idk much about jojo siwa so i can't speak to whether or not she's decent, but this "rebrand" isn't really harmful or morally wrong. just heavyhanded and mid.
Ah a fellow Harvey from Stardew Valley appreciator.
She can't sing tho! She never could! Being a child star was successful because she didn't need to actually sing. Just put on fun outfits and dance around and it's good. An adult star requires actual talent that she doesn't have.
Girl forgot to mention, Miley Cyrus
The thing is, she's still marketing herself as a child artist. There's nothing edgy about talking about your new song for weeks on tiktok. There's nothing cool about rehearsing your choreography in your car and in your bed at 4 am. There's nothing inherently wrong with these things, but to make yourself look tough and edgy you kind of have to act like you don't care. Alternative is all about not caring what people think of you.
Heard someone call her BDSM sea monkey and nearly shit myself
Please she even helt lil concerts for "true fans" and 1st. didnt sing 90% of those oncerts, just the music in the back. 2nd. shes literally the same just black and white and ponytail in the middle instead of to the side, same rinestones in the hair and on the clothes, same sort of makeup, just in black and so on. im crying
God I feel so bad for her. Her entire life she's been literally managed and not allowed to develop like a normal teen because they were making her maintain this "for 7-year-olds" image and now they're finally letting her be an adult and it's clearly such a big deal to her and to the rest of us it's just so cringe. Child stardom is unethical for real.
I was gonna say I feel bad for her because it’s like she’s going through her cringey teen phase a decade late and in a few years she’s gonna hate herself for being so embarrassing but honestly she deserves it (and worse) for enabling her family to mistreat a bunch of children
anyone can recommend yt channels like this?
gonna be honest - I dont doubt the 12 hour practices are necessary.....for jojo
The fact that she thinks she’s doing something revolutionary just tells me how insanely hard her mom is probably still working to keep her cut off from culture and the real world in general. Absolutely criminal tbh. There’s gonna be a big storm coming if that girl ever finds out how hard she’s been being played, but if it hasn’t happened yet I don’t have much hope for her.
As a bi woman, I didn’t mind the music video that much, as the rap and hip-hop videos have been doing the heterosexual equivalent for years. I think it needed to be mellowed out a little bit, but the content itself wasn’t horrible.  That being said, the fact that it came off like a child desperate to do adult things was what bothered me. She is technically an adult, 21 next month, but anyone in their late 20’s and older knows that if you look back at your early 20’s, you were still a kid who didn’t know much. The child star issues just compound that. The video and song were weird and awkward, but not complete trash. As long as people criticize how she approached her music and new look instead of her sexuality, I’m fine with some friendly shit talk.
Nah she did not insult Lady Gaga by comparing herself to her😭
9:12 KISSING HARVEY! BLASPHEMY !
Acting like she invented "gay pop" is INSANE.
sooo off topic but I JUST MARRIED HARVEY.... HE IS EVERYTHING!!!!!!
3:34 “guys whaT if there’s boTH” too good.
Any joyous occasion has been ruined by JoJo's thrust game and I'll never know a cringe free world again
the way she walked in her outfit on the iheartradio carpet was so awkward. it feels more like a costume and less like something more accurate to her personality
If you're dressing like that and not making metal, or at least hard rock, you're doing it wrong.
so does she make music
She always looks like a big ass action figure
Man if I were American I’d sue you for my bleeding ears beautiful song 😂
BBUYGUGHHGHHYYGHH CHAD CHAD JOJO REFERENCE HAHHGHSSDHGJJG
its all so.... corprorate? and frankly that goth/glam rock/??? corpse makeup??? is just kind of.... kidz bop vibes......
Just found this channel and i love it
Best avatar joke ever i love it
7:29 i do that move anytime I'm near a rapidly blinking light
She didn't even write karma!!! It's a cover, and she is so obsessed with creating a new genre of music but she hasn't even made anything new🤨 Like... what?
that poor dog having to watch that 😭
Jojo Siwa: Darkmode
I had a horrible sunburn on my face while watching this and I gotta say I tried so hard not to laugh because it hurts so bad but you're just crazy funny.
She looks like a stand user now
5:27 Right! And Livie is well known! How could JoJo miss that?
We're not makin' fun of her cuz she'z 2 edgy, it's cuz she'z barely edgier than Taylor Swift lulz.
Hater
Jojo is Jojo's biggest fan
The ChadChad remixes of songs are literally one of my favorite things I absolutely lost my shit
Jojo be lady gaga-ing it up in here😂
…as a wise man once said “she looks like the before and after of smoking crack cocaine”  (The rebrand)
*Your editor is god.*
not harvey
not knowing who gene simmons is is truly wild tbh 💀💀💀
Not Jojo saying she'd invent a new genre of music and then went and copied WORD FOR WORD a song by another creator 🫣 Ig she thinks we're stupid or smth🤪
She is too loud and pushy for this change to be welcomed. The way she says ‘nobody has had this dramatic of a change’ no, thank you
She’s in her emo era don’t judge her yall 😔😔
Girl you just created a new dance genre, Avatarcore
its what a 5 yr old kid thinks what being bad looks like....
karma (chad chad's version)
What made y'all hate her so bad I'm genuinely curious
Miley was edgy in real life, selena just grew up without trying to prove her age, olivia, Sabrina, dove, everyone is doing it right.  Jojo is just looking like a fool by trying too hard to fake it. Both are old and new look are loud and obnoxious. Either she doesn't have any taste or it's not just too bad to be everyone's cup of tea
I'm jealous of how her beard came through. That's some impressive length for her age!  Oh wait, never mind, it's paint.
It's even worse that she didn't write the song SHE STOLE IT AND SAID IT'S HERS 😭
The song came out on my birthday….. I was cooked
Genuinely taken aback. Gay is baaad and bad girl and edgy. 🎉😂😂😂
You're funny. I like you. Subscribed
She seems like a 13 year old talking about how mature they are cause they know what a genitals is.
"no one has made in my generation this EXTREME of a switch" JoJo you are not the first to go through an emo phase
First of all, nice shirt.  Second of all, I agree  that her mom is behind this.  THIRD of all😂 I honestly feel bad for jojo and it is the most cringe I have cringed all day. ( I watched the music video before I saw that you did a video talking about it) I appreciate your sense of humor
I miss the old jojo but I support thank u jojo for guiding me from my childhood!! 😢😊
It’s the fact she didn’t even write the song.
She's having what we in the industry called, a Miley Cyrus
that was the least sexy or sexual humping I have ever seen
fun fact the song jojo swia made is not her song it actually was made by someone else
reminder that shes going around claiming she wrote this song for an ex and the actual owner is probably gonna sue her.
i’ll literally never like Jojo, along with being insufferable she’s just a straight up bad person
the funniest part is that it isnt even her song!!!
God I feel so bad for this girl
this whole stunt being a coverup for her abusing disabled kids is wild
"no one has ever made this dramatic of a change" kpop groups changing their hair, aesthetic and identity every time they have a new comeback.
i still can’t believe her new song came out on my birthday😭😭😭
The thing I think no one take into account is who her actual audience is. Like everyones making fun of her for dressing up like "a little girls idea of a bad girl" and like that's probably the whole point. The girls who are her audience are starting to hit that pre-teen angst and she's giving them dark and miss understood but not quite sexy. lol I guarantee if I was a 5th grade girl again I would've thought she was really cool. I think it's all on purpose and if it's not I think it'll work ...
You didn’t even thank me for watching. I’m NEVER coming back here.
She ruined my birthday with her song
Watching chadchad learn the dance was something I didn’t know I needed but I did need it. I did
Its giving doja cat's satanic era or something idk
When I have kids I’ll tell them this was p!nk 😊
I'm sorry Chad Chad, but this was not what I signed up for. I have been an avid viewer of 'twinge of cringe' for a while now and this one is officially too much cringe to fall under the umbrella of 'a twinge'. I request that you create another channel/identity/universe for this content because clearly, the algorithm is going to find this divergent from your usual content as well.
Harvey is babygirl so I understand why you’d smooch him 12 hours straight Personally I like Sam he’s a silly little goober
With how much ppl were talking about the song plus her… I thought it already came out lol
So many people that should absolutely not have a platform. I mean the fact that her mother and her created a show that was disguised to everyone from the mothers of the dancers involved to the viewers and everyone else as a kinder better show than dance moms but internally was even worse. Then to the fact they exploited a disabled girl with scoliosis to the point they pushed her BEFORE A SURGERY to practice instead of letting her rest to the point THE LITTLE GIRL WAS BLEEDING FROM HER BELLY BUTTON BUTTON. did they then decide to let her rest? Oh God no these monsters told her  TO PUT A MAXI PAD ON IT AMD KEEP DANCING. They uprooted the mother from Texas she had to.leave her other kids behind to support her daughter in this adventure as she was promised a friendly space to grow to stardom but ended uo just being fired and discarded even though this little girl was trying so hard and was doing great and promised an environment far evolved from her time with Abby but curated a worse place eventually using thwae girls as a gift of dolls to her mother so she could get some space and she just sacrificed them to her mother for her own wellbeing. And still acts like she doesn't have the mental state of a small child.
2:10 the phrasing in this? "may" ?? like she probably made this list before thinking of the themes. why not just "the following content contains..." why "may"??
chad chad is a harvey girl confirmed
Nothing says edgy like telling everyone you’re edgy now.
It's so wild that pewdiepie has rebranded like 8 times at this point, yet rucka rucka ali hasnt even done one, yet they've operated the same length of time.
Cant believe that you married Harvey of all people.
I love you chad chad
You people just keep hating no matter what. You bullied her for being too childish but now you’re all pretending you liked her before? Make up your minds.
I came here to cringe at Jojo Siwa, but then Chad Chad started dancing...
So this is the anime all my friends keep talking about?
ChadChad did the soy thing! 😲👉
she looks like Donald trump
It actually makes me sad that people are shitting on her so hard :(
release the full version or else, chadchad
Can't get over her rebranding herself as a Bad Girl yet still won't say fuck XD
I honestly don't understand why everyone is clowning her. Yes it's "soft" all things considered but when put in the context of the niche that she was into, that's definitely a huge jump, especially her being so open about her homosexuality while her public is mainly made of children. I think you all forgot the backlash she received from parents when she came out because it was considered "inappropriate towards her young audience"
10:16 jonathan joestar erasure
Why does jojo sound like she’s eaten a dozen packs of cigarettes
Jojojojojojojojojojo lol. Yours was way better.
Miley Cyrus’ jump was probably the most extreme and dramatic
Jojo got akumatized lmao
My personal favorite bit is that for all the training she put herself and other people through, there's still what seems to be a stunt-double cut shot when she does that front flip
damn, chad chad is the avatar! how did I not know this?
Not sure if she's actually a lesbian or not, but either way, when are people gonna stop thinking girl on girl is edgy?
The forbidden Kiss member
I love how her trying to move away from her child audience is literally the type of song and outfits kids are drawn to, look at the average kid now they’re not liking for bows and rainbows. They’re looking for the euphoria type crazy and her outfit literally just looks like something you’d find in a Halloween store. Though her “dance moves” in the mv are not child friendly it’s definitely not going to keep kids away. She’s still pandering to her kid fans. She legit says “eff around” ur not being edgy when saying eff I’m sorry you can disagree but you’re wrong.
Yo I heard that TF2 background music at ~5:20 I see you
Would be pretty cool if you did a stardew valley play through 😎
Anyone else think her new song sounds like an Alvin and The Chipmunks mix?
She didn’t have the chance to grow into an adult since so much of her profit came from her being that ‘childish, colourful’ girl, so now it’s like she’s trying to be what she *thinks* an adult is
"Ughh! You just don't get me mom! It isn't a phase!" She said after entering her emo/Kiss phase
Finish the lyrics: I WaS A bAd gUrL I DiD SuM bAd ThIngS✨😝
She is the equivalent of a my little pony with a lightning bolt sticker.
guys joho is sm else right?
Ladies and Gentlemen, i present thy, the one qnd only jojo's bizzare adventure
7:10 GERMANY MENTIONED (on the car) (im sorry idk i just had to say it)
Gene Simmons from Justice
The mortal kombat xray was so good 😭😭
God, what a self-absorbed prick JoJo is
Yes! Another Harvey lover! ❤❤
I'm old and a dude so I know nothing about Jojo Siwa but this whole "transformation" feels so forced and corporate-ized, like everything was decided ahead of time in a board room and Jojo is just a really bad actor that's getting into method acting.
i feel terribly for her. child stars can never be free
It's not even her song, lol Edit: I guess technically, it's her song since she bought the rights to it.
the fact that chad chad didn't even put that much effort in to trying to perfect the dance and still did it better than Jojo
Aww I love this channel so glad I found it
but why is it just the toxic music video on a yacht instead of a plane? and surprisingly... also with more rhinestones?! ahahahaha
This is literally Robin Sparkles
ok yeah jojo jojo but the tf2 music at 5:15 is so real
I wasn't excited, but when she played the actual song at the end of the video it was fire.
Loved the jojo ref 🥰
Wait. Olivia Rodrigo is from the Disney Channel? I thought she was just a regular young artist not a pipeline product. Not that it matters, just surprised.
She looks like a discount Animal from the road warriors lol
shes forgetting that dove cameron has VERY drastic change after she left disney not only that ALOT of her fan base are little girls and her releasing this music video with basically soft porn or just porn idk and the fact she defended colleen Ballinger its rubbing me the entire wrong way
Hey at least the mum waited till her daughter was 21 before pivoting to sexual themes in her music
how did you get harveyyyy?
Girl went from Pink to P!nk 😭
The way JoJo Siwa moves in that dance reminds me of when my tourettes fits get really bad. Girl help
This should be in the dictionary under "try-hard". At least then, she'll have some cultural relevance.
SHe not knowing who Gene Simmons or Kiss are when there are clear references to them 💀
The way the dance actually looks like bending from avatar lmao
She looks like a wrestler character
thou shall not lie😭✋
She's so unoriginal and so uninspired. Lol she's acting like it wasn't the record label that came up with this idea
I mean the songs ok but It sounds more like kids bop than edgy punk
Why do some people exist?
Did not peg chadchad as a Harvey girl
9:08 unbelievably real 1.6 dropped and now i have no free time anymore
She created a new kinda music alright. A whole new subculture really. Gay cringe core
I read the title as edging, my brainrot is irreversible 💀
"gay pop" by the person who can barely say lesbian is crazy
9:55 HELP
Goofy ahhh
she tried to replicate the look of kiss but she got a very brief description of them like 10 years ago
8:09 i love the dry humour 😭😂
did she not learn anything from the dream face reveal thing. The more you hype up the audience for a normal thing, the more you gonna be trolled T_T I feel bad for her but she set this up to fail.
This is the gen z equivalent of the Steve buscemi skateboarding meme.
Omg the copyright fee edition was the best thing ever! 😂
1:30 pepole that have came here Are there to make fun of her
Her dark sparkles scare me 😱
The return of your “copyright safe” music is an absolute blessing 👌😌  (Also, YouTube why the fluff did it take you a solid day to recommend this vid to me??)
I like your shirt. Deers are AWESOME! 🦌
chad chad you can't keep putting avatar references anymore I almost banged my head against the metal bench in sitting on I almost died actually
I love clowning on this video and the run up in promo for it but it's a shame what mass media does to young people. Like going through an extremely transformational time in your life and then have it blasted out to everyone just ain't right. I feel bad for her and hope she doesn't get older and look back like "damn wish I didn't do all that silly shit when I was younger" cause now everyone knows and remembers it and will never forget and can Google it whenever they want. Idk I just don't think young people should ever be put under a microscope. Unfortunate but here we are.
The defense of abusers and mistreatment of her fellow stars sounds bad but I wonder how much of the mistreatment and bad career decisions are her ideas or just her mom strongarming her career. After reading "I'm Glad My Mom Died" and spending weeks hearing people highlight the abuse child actors face, I'm surprised how few people consider that before jumping to harass her without remembering she was a minor for most of her career and probably not responsible for a lot of corporate decisions. She basically originated from Abuse Your Daughters On Camera: TLC Edition. This girl is going to have a painful memoir in a decade I'm calling it now.
Her Dance is like someone is being exorcised by Witcher 💀
Jojo gives me Sarah Lynn flashbacks.....especially with her mom behind the rebranding......
as someone who loves stardew valley that Harvey reference made me giddy
This is my favorite video of yours
Kissing and smooching Harvey from Stardew Valley is so real and valid
Shes cosplaying Gene Simmons and doesn't know who he is... I would end my life after that google search
I hate how she talks like shes not breathing and too excited about nothing. She seems perpetually going to pass out from lack of oxygen.
She's trying to be Lil Nas X
WHERE'S THE HUMPING?! 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 Thanks Chad lol
She aint edgy she is fucking round
Calling it now, the Jojo documentary is gonna go absolutely insane. It’s gonna be the Leaving Neverland of our generation
She's so addicted to attention...
When I started to see JoJo pop up because of her new image I thought she was Honey Boo Boo, like JoJo was her real name 😅  Full disclosure, I'm not American.
This is the funniest video I've seen of yours. 😂
As cringey and questionable her choices are I just feel pity tbh. Like this girl has been exploited in every aspect of her life and continued to be raked through the public’s eye. Of course I dont believe that’s an excuse for her. Just hope she can maybe live a normal life she never got the chance to have
Turns out the real bad girl was a mom pushing her child into stardom all along.
Thank you for your reporting on Jojo Siwa. I have no interest in her career, but I fo enjoy your videos. Also, I need to remind everyone that Jolyne Cujoh is the best JoJo
I'm still believing that this is all a cover-up for the XOMG POP controversy/allegations
I will go study if i get 100 likes
Jojo siwa went from an inspiration to little girls to being clowned by those grown up little girls
my favorite thing about this is that she waited till she was 20 to go "18+" like something about her being too afraid of breaking out of her niche makes this move so funny to me.
THE DOG SCREAM
I thought all pop was gay
She’s the exact same persona and style as before, she just dyed her clothes black
They're using this as a publicity stunt to drown out any articles about the lawsuit. Even saying things like, "we're rehearsing 12 hours a day" can replace the victims from XOmgwhateverdancegroup reporting long hours being forced to rehearse by Jojo & her mom. Wearing the shirt "Jojo Siwa is a bitch" is another potential headline that could drown out victims potential quotes. This all seems very calculated, like a coverup buuuuut maybe I'm wrong
9:45 but when the world needed her the most, she vanished
Ive no problem with her being “edjy” but after being marketed as child friendly for years she shouldnt be making stuff inappropriate. Or at least label herself as “not for kids”
I had a realization that jojo’s just acting like a 20 year old who’s been forced to wear the same ridiculous outfit her whole life and is finally given freedom to dress herself. She doesn’t know wtf to do with that 😂😂 but dang dude take a hiatus and figure yourself out *AND THEN* come back with the rebrand this is so cringe to see…
GUYS LISTEN TO THE ORIGINAL SONG .
I think it's time we turn our attention towards her supporting p*dophiles, instead of making fun of her (lack of) dancing skills (seriously how though?! hasn't she been dancing for a really long time?). If she's old enough to make this "edgy" transformation and curse(lol), she's old enough to take accountability for her actions. I mainly pity her tbh, she must have serious mental trauma and bad management to act like this
I don't think she deserves the roast this hard.   she wants to join the crew with Madonna, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, and Miley Cyrus. she just needs to appreciate the canon of child star to adult pop star. like it is perfectly acceptable to join that crew. people want you there.  just, like, chill out about it and you won't get destroyed by ChadChad.
Harvey stans, rise up (Not too high, he's scared !)
She just seems so fake, like everything she does is a badly staged act she puts on
She be goin’ through an emo stage 😭
r/im14andthisisdeep is her new personality
Harvey stans rise up
Harvey? You wanna smooch HARVEY? (Wait, is that the bit?) 😂
i feel like kanye west BUT the biggest good girl gone bad is Britney Spears with I am slave 4 you…like jojo girl should know her place 😂
can we talk about her precious  dog that looks kinda like scooby do 12:15 ?
This is giving off Kurtis Conner vibes and I dig it. Just they style of the interjections but also this is the first video I’ve watched on this channel :)
This is what kiss would look like it you combined every member then made them trans
I love how my entire dance studio is making fun of her for her new style
JOJO need to calm down
10:27 JOJO REFERENCE???
why is it so dark?
Surprised you didn’t talk about how her song isn’t original and is a copy of a 2012 song
Chad Chad didn't do her outro :(
she is a industry plant xD
Don't try to pivot to 18+ if you're still coming off as a pre-teen, especially with the "mom mom, check out my new dance move" vibe of this whole marketing campaign.
Thermonuclear  CRINGE.
Girl you went ready to say you were a bad girl? You told the entire world you're a lesbian. A repetitive bubble gum song doesn't scream edgy
I think she missed a few pages of life
Every time  I see a Chad Chad video I almost immediately wish it was an hour longer
This was a top-tier Chad Chad video.  "Pay thousands to have it plastered on a Kia Soul" might have been my favorite line.
Nobody knows what's happening? Jojo I'm trying not to but fuck I know more than I already want to
she even stole the song lmfaoo
stress procleanstination solidarity
no ones had this dramatic of a switch? the kid from home alone begs to differ
So not sorry but she is a cringe and she needs to be stoped
Hrr body is pitifull not sexy at all.
My birthday is Mother's Day
I like Chad Chad’s cover hetter
Mhe, stone ocean vibes... wait!
Looks like Gold Dust. She wanna wrestle so bad.
I loved jojo when i was 10 bruh now at 18 i have to  rethink my choices
not Jojo Bizzare adventure?
you didn't even mention it was brit smiths unreleased song from 2010
Jojo has always been cringey and 😊shameless about promoting her own "art". I think people are just coming to terms with it. 🤣
ngl her eye makeup and stuff looks like the monster logo kind of
When a person becomes a product - Imagine the potential for activism if JoJo stopped  marketing herself and became AUTHENTIC.  Is a human raised to perform "role of "pop-star" able to touch anything real or authentic inside, or are they a walking, breathing "persona" for capitalist public consumption?  THERAPY, please.
whoever said she looks like she costs 1800 overwatch coins in the store is going to hell 😭😭😭😭
Fun fact: this isn’t even Jojo’s original song.    Also as someone who’s been in dance for 10 years you ate that 💯
If you can't be an authentic activist   Go "grow-up" in private. You CAN afford to retire..
“It’s called gay pop” 💀 that’s a first
12 hour dance rehearsals are very normal. Every team I've ever been in in the last 15 years does them
It's crazy how she says b***h and doesn't say f**k but fword
Chad Chad get's lot of views because of her looks
This has gone far enough and it's time for the reflection album
CHAD² WITH THE MOVES LOVE YA
How self-centered do you have to be to have your face patterned on your car  Even as a kid I never really liked her. She just made me feel iffy or annoyed I only have one jojo brand bow but only because it was rainbow and I need to show how gay I am
chad chad you better not get canceled. eat your vegetables, stay in school, stay out of minors.
7:11 The car rapping made me fall off my chair
Jojo took some molly at a festival or something
Had this on in the background and just shot up like a sleeper agent when you said Harvey from stardew 😭😭😭
You how have 69 videos
Fun fact: the song isn't even hers, it's literally a cover.
can’t let the gang know i lowkey fw karma ☠️☠️🙏
i like how she uses lesbianism as a device to communicate that she is a "bad girl" indicating that homosexuality is wrong 🫠
Eww, just eww..
the Alien Cake poster is such a flex
jojo's bizarre adventure is truly getting wild
She’s legit fem Jake Paul. I don’t think that was the “bad girl” transformation she was going for tho. Oopsie.
kinda feel bad for her tho like do people expect a person who was forced into adult beauty standards as a little kid and forced upon national television just to be told of and degraded to grow up and just be like 100% sane (I'm not defending her for anything, I just don't see the harm with this “re-brand”)? and like her mom seems to be behind this aswell so i don't think you can't 100% blame jojo (or any former child star in a similar situation) for these weird shenanigans.
fyi she bought the song from another singer lmfao
9:08 she was so real for that🙏
👴🏻 Gay pop! Their coming after our music as well.
Jojo’s stuck in her princess phase for years. Now it’s time fir her villain arc ⛓️⛓️🖤🖤😈😈
Please do a follow up talking about the plagiarism rumors? cuz apparently all of her new music is a carbon copy of existing songs.
1:01 ngl I never heard better description of *Dance moms* and i have watched like 3 videos about it 💀  AND the thing that you have 69 videos now *I can not find a good emoji so...that is all*
9:46 had me dying 😂😂😂😂😂💀
Tbh that music video really looks like she's trying to copy Lil Nas X and the style and type of music video he's doing. There are so many elements that parallel Montero
The most brutally shocking thing in this video is the fact that you’re a Harvey girlie
Why are we not talking about the deer shirt?  I don't know what to say about it, per se, but I feel like it warrants a conversation
@zachpeters7899 you’re famous
Chad Chad - please make like 100000 more videos every day plz x
Is there no way of artist to target adult audience without discussing $ex
The fact I still have jojo siwas hairbows around my room somehow 😔
I just want Jojo to learn how to overline her upper lip for God's sake
The crazy part is the mom Jojo is a victim here
the fact that I got that same cutscene with Harvey while watching that video
Raycon deez nuts
Most extreme change…. Come on Miley Cyrus has that locked for a generation
6:51 not the Jojo car💀😭
im so glad youre a harvey fan omg <33
Why does she have a raspy 40 year old voice at the age of 20?
You ALWAYS get me with the sponsor! Every time!
once upon a time she was just a girl who loved juice
chad chad can u do a video about those girls that attacked that other girl who glued on piercings?
The way I wait for these videos. Instant joy every time.
the only thing that is coming back is the boomerang
8:26 na...don't say that. My mum's 50 and laughed when she saw Jojo's 'transformation'😂😂
stardew valley Harvey lovers unite🙏🙏🙏
Sometimes i watch the full add because i want chad chad to make more money….❤
this aint jojo’s bizarre adventure, it’s jojo’s wild trip
of course you like harvey
I genuinely like her new song (wow would you look at that I still haven't gotten out of my descendants phase) and the atmosphere of it but the choreography and the rest are just...
Why is her idea of a bad girl dressing like fcking Kiss
the new outfit is giving WWE vibes...
jojo whent from a skittle to charcoal
This just reminds me when I entered my emo phase in 6th grade and thought that just wearing black and cussing in every sentence made me hardened and edgy
A STARDEW VALLEY REFERENCE! Honestly I never thought Chad Chad could become even more of a Chad but she just proved me wrong.
no outro music or thank you for clicking on my video, damn
WTF that song had a video!
I ain’t wanna be a bitch but your like the 4th channel I’ve seen of this in the last week. Woman in the middle makes a face, zigzag in the middle with two pictures. Just makes me think ai lmao your AI
i definitely agree that it might be her mom that’s behind it
I’ve never been a fan of her however before I felt bad for her since she was being bullied when she didn’t do anything wrong she was a child entertainer and It worked since many young children loved her and had her bows and she was young herself but then more and more things came out about her and she’s old enough to know better now she Is actually cringe she’s acting like a teenager who is pretending to be crazy and trying to be edgy
Chad chad is amazing and beautiful
If i were her management/publicist, I'd make her go to indie/folk route. She was known for overly glittery and loud appearance. The polar opposite of her brand would be more toned-down and grounded concept.  Bad girl rebrand worked on Miley because she was known as the girl next door, so the polar opposite worked, while in Jojo's case, this rebrand doesn't feel like rebrand because it's basically the same Jojo, but black.  It feels very ingenuine bcs it feels half-baked in compare to her claim that she's going all out for this. The contrast is not enough to say that this is a rebrand of "old" Jojo Siwa.
STARDEW VALLEY MENTIONED
i know this is prime content but with the biggest youtubers like Chad Chad talking about JS constantly, she's just getting more promo for her "rebrand"
it's so incredibly sad how bad she wishes she had a new edgy mental disorder that is yet to be discovered. no jojo you can't have our trauma...YOU CANT SIT WITH US.
LETS DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN
9:47 i love the avatar reference
Wth Gay Pop is already a thing she isn't inventing anything new
I don’t know why but she looks like a knockoff Otep
Why do I feel like JoJo Siwa is just becoming a baby Ellen Degeneres?
She's living in a synthetic Lazy Town world without knowing and now "upgraded" into a Lazy Town villain. She should take shelter in the world of the common people and rehabilitate before she breaks down like so many other female child stars before her.
This is like the 4th Jojo siwa rebrand reaction I'm watching and I don't even care about JoJo siwa 😭
The fact she didn't even write Karma, it was originally recorded by Britt Smith in 2012
she rly took that song n made it her own💀💀
love your T btw🦌🤩
not Chad Chad entering her old man with a broken knee era... what an icon ✨
goddd that interview "i'm a bad girl i'm a grown up i'm edgy and emo now" and then the backdrop of her room looks like her earlier music threw up on it
Jojo’s rebrand is the most corporate and forced thing I’ve seen
THE AIR BENDING TOOK ME OUT OH MY GOD 😭😭💀💀
Guys, I think Chad Chad is transitioning to her inevitable "bad-girl" stage, she didn't even say thank you for me for clicking on her video from all the videos.
chad chad you’re absolutely bloody hilarious, there is no one else i would want to see in the world talking about jojo’s new bad girl era
i blame Jessica for all of this.  and i regretted a last one min sec of my existence.  why did i see a girl who's the same age as me humping?
Hey Chad Chad. I lost my ability to love. But love you (platonic love dudes). I hope the best always and take care <3
Jojo's giving mexican wrestler vibes with that outfit 😂
8:42 THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! That's why she reminds me of my guy Gene 😭😭😭😭😭 and I love KISS.
chad chad you look like hayley williams
I feel like there's going to be a Jennette McCurdy-style backstory revealed here someday
She’s my new fav youtuber
midlife crisis at 20
i had to pause the video & have a moment when she was acting all hey mamas with her new “edgy” persona… sitting in one of her unicorn multi color pastel car seats. this has to be bad satire.
If JoJo has just been cringe or whatever this comeback, i could not have cared less; she was obviously a very very sheltered and exploited child, despite how much she toured. I think a 'weird' or 'cringe' phase is needed for any teen, so whenever she has one of her own accord (aka not the bows and glitter her company put on her, but something she 100% decided herself and still was cringe), it would've been so okay and totally normal.  However, the fact that this song is a 1 to 1 rip off of an already existing song (which was not super popular, so there was a slim chance she'd get away with it too) is just... sad. If it was a decision of higher-ups, i could understand it and even defend her from the hate. But with how much she promoted the song herself and talked about it as this super new phenomenom, makes me think she did know it was not real. And, yeah, that deserves a calling-out.  HOWEVER, the amount of bullying y'all online asses get up to is not okay, lol. You hide behind your pfp all you want and think its cool and funny and edgy to make fun of (in this order, from what i've seen): her dancing (not as horrible as y'all say), her look (pathetic if you do this), her sexual dancing (why is this even an issue? she's an adult, if she wants to hump a girl in a mv, let her? so many artists do this).
Not Chad Chad putting Team Fortress 2 music in the background 😭 (I think)
what gets me is it's not even her song 😭😭😭
Is everyone wayching this 12? Ive seen a few videos of JoJo so this was recommended to me and its the least informative, least original.. and downright lazziest video ive seen.. yet somehow has the most views..  wtf?
Whatever JoJo is doing is cringy as f***.
Why does this have 1m views
Chad chad becomes the avatar after rehearsing a dance for 12 hours
jojo reference goes hard
RAHHHHHHH PERSONA OST IN THE BACKGROUND HEARD  AND SPOTTED
jojo is the weird doll you find in the kids’ pink toy aisle at target
with how many commentary youtubers I watch are talking about her, I'm starting to think this is all a marketing stunt and she paid you all to comment on it lol
The face paint is giving monster energy logo.
YOU LIKE STARDEW VALLEY!?
Thr worst part was saying you romance Harvey I stardew
Honestly I’m not a fan of jojo, but I can’t help but feel bad for her. It’s obvious that her childhood was terrible, all the spotlights, as well as just the environment and people aren’t good for anyone, let alone a child
JoJo See-ya (never)
the avatar and jojo references got me crying 😭😭😭
i spilled my cinnamon toast crunch while watching this fuck you   im sorry i didnt mean that i was just upset about spilling my cinnamon toast crunch
Was that a JoJo reference?
The influence of the environment she grew up in is so strong. Dance culture can be really toxic and create patterns that people spend *years* working through, and Dance Moms was an even more extreme version
1 MILLION IN A DAY 🤯
Me using my reycons watching this while ignoring the noise of my kids. 😂😂 also, JoJo sounds a bit of a narcissist.
no but why that part in the music video where they are on like an island(??) looks so much like if Rihanna's Umbrella was bad
1. By 25 Jojo Siwa will be cringing every time someone brings up this era of her career.  Hopefully, she's able to recover like Miley Cyrus has (though Jojo's change has been more extreme).  2. Her mom is partially responsible for what's going on here.  We worry about older adults dating folks who are "barely legal" but Jojo Siwa is not even old enough to drink yet and her mom seems to be enabling, maybe even insisting on, her worst behavior.
to add: shes not referring to being a bad girl because of the controversy surrounding the younger girl group, its about her being a cheater with her past relationships, but meant to be a stab toward her ex whom she cheated on but refers to her ex being a cheater.
The worst part is the song is actually kinda a bop 😭
When you model your ear for these raycon ads, I swoon every time.
to be fair, imagine being a child star. and everyone judging you. i love your content but let the girl breathe  we have no idea what pressure there is on her. imagine your entire life filmed and shown to the world. if you had zero privacy would you still be so judgmental?
8:20 A ChadTheory 😂
I'd like to know when Chad Chad is launching her music video career. Her cover was just as good as the real thing. When that song comes out on karaoke she's gonna kill it Like literally  Thank you in advance
I have terrible second hand embarrassment from all this. Also, I have to give her props for just trying to be positive and somewhat oblivious to how stupid this rebrand is. It’s for the best, being unaware… But, she seems happy and excited so, props for that? And no matter how many people hate it, it IS getting her a lot of attention & views.
errr... so bad, psycho and crazy = .... gay?  Am I the only one that feels that's kinda weird messaging?
I was watching a live C section before this, but the minute I saw this video, I had to click on it. Totally worth interrupting it for this!
My thing is, she is praising HERSELF and making it sound like everyone is saying how revolutionary she is but no one was thinking that girly. Like she is trying sooo hard to get people to believe that she is the first person to do something like this when literally nothing abt it is original. NOT EVEN THE SONG LMAO
SHE'S *20* 😭😭😭😭😭💀💀😭💀😭💀😭😭😭💀💀💀😭😭💀😭💀😭💀
this was so much more than a twinge of cringe, my chaddius.
jojo thought she could outdo my glorious blued eye king gojo by copying his moves 😭💯 jojo stop trying to be gojo.
Yknow i think she has a very awful case of Manchester's syndrome because of her abusive mom.
Well jojo's rebrand still comes with the high pony💀
Your rendition of Jojo's song really stirred my soul, I truly feel like I've gone to the dark side. Thanks ChadChad
"A new genre of music. It's called gaypop." proceeds to describe pop.  ... okay.
This whole JoJo thing is so stupid, Idk what's the fuss about this woman growing up and going through a phase.   Its basically like beating a dead tree at this point, let this woman grow up from being a child icon to an adult popstar that's goth (no matter how non-adult it is)  Like come on, we ain't got better to do than to clown on this chick or like me make comments to said topic. Come on, we can do better.
RARE HARVEY MENTION????‼️💃🏼❤️‍🔥🤯🧎🏼‍♀️
I feel like we’re about to witness a World Record ‘Child Star to mental breakdown’ speedrun
Not to mention, this isn't even her song at all. Pretty much changed one word and named it her own "original" song
The fact that she didn’t write the song 🥳
i need a copy of your deer shirt STAT
So real question, What are your thoughts on flushed away? How has it affected your life?  👨🏼‍💼*Photo of Chris Pratt
BMW I8 MENTIONED????????????????
MGK for hey mamas
“Where’s the humping. I wanna see humping” 😭😭
Jojo: Im the first to have this drastic change   Robbin daggers: hold my mall pretzel
Jojo then:🌈 Jojo now:🏳️‍🌈
People do know there were gay people before Lady Gaga right?
chad chad definitely was traumatized after that video
CHAD CHAD ARE YOU A JOJOS BIZARRE ADVENTURE FAN
she might actually be the _least_ edgy celebrity of all time.
you did NOT just make a Harvey feom stardew valley  reference 😭😭😭😭 i think i just deceased
Bro wants to be lil nas x in her music video so bad 😭😭😭
Jojo sounds like Steve-O...  I know this doesn't really have anything to do with the video but I just needed to get this off my chest
Friends and I concluded it was because of the lesbian inside of her (we are lesbians too)
Bro why did she delete all her old videos like I’m trying to watch her review some bows😭😭
alien cake 🙂‍↔️
She has the same cadence as Donald Trump
her "new personna" looks like the heel character from a Christian-oriented family friendly backyard wrestling league... "LOOK OUT YAUL! IT'S LIL STINKER!!!"
chad chads annual post <3 we've been blessed by the gods
Jojo is not popular anymore
No 'thank you for watching' :c damn you Jojo! Daaaammmnnn yyyooooouuuuuuuuu!
Your dog screaming had me 😂
Im sorry Chad Chad but that uncensored "Gee Wh*zz" was too far. Im going to have to unsubscribe. God bless you
The dance routine ❤🎉👯‍♂️ we loved it
the avatar joke was really good
Messed aroun- FD ArOuND
So wait, what's the dance even for? If it's for a music video... bro, practice for like one 5 hour session, film, be done. If it's for stage performances... why is she doing the exact same dance as everyone else?
Jojo did NOT come back like a boomerang 😭😭
i geinuinly think that jojo is just having an identity crisis from being a childhood star to, whatever... that is
Sometimes I’m glad to be old so I don’t have to be exposed to garbage like this (not counting when I willingly watch you expose me to stuff like this that’s different). She seems unbelievably intolerable.
harvey fan💀
"I am the first person of our generation to make a big change in my career, and in music" -Jojo Siwa   Olivia Rodrigo, Ariana Grande, and almost every Nickelodeon and Disney star: "HELLO I AM RIGHT HERE"
Chad Chad, you CANNOT say "f*ddlest*cks" in this economy. in Joe Biden's America.
and she didnt even write the song 😭😭😭 its from another girl that made it in the 2000's and jojo just straight up stole it 😭😭😭 help me
When you said mothers want some peace and quite I felt that
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE HER FOR POSTING THAT BLASPHEMOUS SONG ON KURT COBAIN’S 30 YEAR DEATH ANNIVERSARY. HAVE SOME RESPECT
This reminds me of when I was 7 - 12 and tried to be “”emo”” (side part, a black band shirt, and moody behavior BAHAHA)
10:48 why would you let your kid do intense physical exercise just a few weeks after SPINAL CORD SURGERY ??
This honestly feels similar to the Sarah Lynn storyline from bojack but not as sympathetic ig? Kid actors/idols trying to stray away from their youthful image by being overtly "adult". Im not intending to justify anything jojo has done or continues to do that are bad but i guess i can just hope she doesnt go down a horrible path, or at least realizes how scummy shes been and tries to change.
The song is not my fave...at all. And the music video isn't shocking. She talked about it like it would be like a porn lmao it was very mild 😂😂
She’s not a “bad girl” she’s a bad person
This poor girl, I wish she wouldn't listen to her mother anymore. I can't stand the hair, stop with the pony tail! How does her head not hurt?
The boomerang must of got stuck in a tree.
I’m convince this all done as bait
"I'm friends with Shane Dawson" "OH MY GOD!" That was too funny 🤧😭
chaddy with another banger
CHADDY WADDY YOU ATE
You fading in and out of dancing had me on the floor 😭
That was a music video of all time
Her costume looks like mega minds villian outfit
Jojo feels like the human embodiment of toxic positivity.
I’m not surprised JoJo doesn’t know about Kiss, her mom looks like one of those suburban moms that thinks rock music is inappropriate for girls but she also loves lil Wane way too much (no disrespect to Wane)
I never liked Jojo and like.... As time goes on I feel like it's less and less weird that I always got BAD vibes from her and her mom.
I didn't get thanked for watching. Where's my validation?
kind of clocked that this whole edgy phase was fabricated by her mother (white suburb mom's idea of what a bad kid is, very shoved down your throat thing) we've seen many artists who got their starts in children's media (LITERALLY ARIANA GRANDE, OLIVIA RODRIGO, SABRINA CARPENTER, THE LIST GOES ON) with a shock on what they've transitioned to. And its one thing if she was just cringy but after seeing that she's actually been a shitty person too she deserves to get clowned on casually like this
5 year-old's today Would be so confused And Just know her as her always being her edgy era Versus 10-100years olds Knowing that she used to be a colorful person Like what happened to the old Jojo 7-8 years ago😭
6:00 I'm friends with shane Dawson 💀
Nobody with a job and/or a life has ever heard of YoYo Seesaw until a week ago.
Her wearing a shirt with a massive Karmas a bitch on the back while also wearing sweatpants that say it costs zero dollars to be a nice person just really says it all
“🎶I was a bad girl… I did some bad things🎶” Girl what bad things exploiting and hurting children?
9:12 STARDEW VALLEY MENTIONED 🗣️
Harvey stardew valley mentioned
THE CAR (W)RAPPING!!!!
you being a harvey girlie is the worst thing I’ve heard about you…💔
You know it probably wouldn't be so bad either if she didn't hype it up so damn much like it's the greatest thing in the world. Why would you do that
I wonder how gene simmons feels about his female temu counterpart 💀✋
9:12 you’re so real for that
CHAD CHAD STAY AWAY FROM MY MAN HARVEY YOURE TOO PRETTY I CANT COMPETE 9:12
“gee whiz” 💀💀
I'm glad she played the video cause I was questioning giving jojo my view
The fact that chad chad after can do the dance better after 20 minutes than jojo can do after 12 hours everyday is absolutely hilarious
“Hip and current band, kiss” lmao Kiss has retired so many times and not going to lie are not hip or current thats dad rock
Ah, the Miley Cirus breakdown moment
the most disturbing part is that she's friends with shane dawson
Can we please retire the off-camera cat joke with the same damned sound effect since 1990? That cat's been dead for decades.
to top it all off she didn’t even write the song like she claims ! 🧍🏾‍♀️
Jessica Siwa had always been a monster and she Jojo into the exact same kind of adult she is. I’m honestly really sad for her. Jojo is 20 and already known for being ruthless and money hungry at the expense of children. That’s all her entire life has been
5:14 IS THAT BACKGROUND SONG ARCHIMEDES??? FROM THE TEAM FORTRESS 2 SOUNDTRACK???  THE SONG FROM TF2???? HELLO??????? 😭😭
this is the devil ngl this is why i stay away from this type of music im a christian.....
She just switched from glitter to monochrome glitter
1:20 "your were an accident"  ... Bruh
Girl plsss why the pickle airplane man
I've been WAITin for this one.
Not the i stock images 😭😭
The funny thing is she didn’t even write the song 😭
I used to want one of her bows when i was like 6 💀😭
We all know that Jotaro Kujo is the best JoJo
what is it with chronically online bisexual women making their entire brand being gay
I’m scared of her mom I hope Jojo’s actually okay
Hot Topic and Claire's merger.... when we weren't noticing.
Lizard queen she will conquer every island resort at Disney Villains Cruise Lines
6:38 NOT THE FACE CAR IN THE BACK LOL
There is something weirdly wholesome and adorable about this whole thing. Yeah, it's super cringe, and it's unfortunate that she thinks she needs/wants a "bad girl era." Also, it is tragic that she's repeating the toxic behaviors that she has been taught growing up in a super exploitative industry.   All that said, it's nice to see a child star pretending to be "bad" rather than actually getting mixed up with serious drugs and/or abusive situations. Yet, I hope she gets out or finds a healthy head space before her "bad girl" actions stop being pretend.
Just so you know.. and I want EVERYONE to see me say this.. Your cover was TOP TIER, You deserve the Emmy Award❤👌✨
And the crazy part is that she didnt even write the song britney murph did 💀
ok i feel they branded this "new" version of jojo so much and be like "omg she is so changed, everyone look at her!!" because she was not trending anymore, idk tho maybe i'm wrong
9:29 You was working that dung! Oh! I am so sorry. please forgive my extremely vile language.
she said “may contain strong language” but she acts like she just learned how to cuss 💀
jojo is 4 months older than me and the maturity difference between us is so fucking crazy like i genuinely do feel sorry for her cus ik she does want to be looked as an adult but this is literally all she knows
You guys don't understand but DaBaby was actually foreshadowing this rebranding when he said "Jojo Siwa BITCH"
This is just Britney Spears all over again, I'm quite frankly amused and mildly disturbed that very few in the comment section have appeared to make that connection. This situation feels so familiar I would be floored if it was even just a hair different.
I’m sorry, you like HARVEY?! Sebastian is clearly the better choice
so glad to have chad’s beautiful talent for covering songs come through in another video, truly blessed on this Siwa morning ♡ lol
Your Avatar training seems to be going well, but I'm afraid you missed the solar eclipse
Gene Slimmons
I can't help liking jojo. She's just such a fuckin weirdo and i love that for her  Never seen a stream, or whatever content she makes, never heard a song of hers, don't know nothing about who she is or what people think of her or why, but every time i see her she's being cringey and weird af and i see that as a positive influence on society lol
To be fair, she is probably giving a million PSAs and TWs so that she doesn't get Olivia Rodrigo'd by mum viewers.
the song is weird because it’s a song someone would produce after they went through a messy and very public breakup, did that happen to jojo siwa? am i that out of the loop?
Someone said she was cosplaying old Gregg hahaha
Low-key definition of poser😭
This rebrand just feels so fake and like a quick cash grab, and publicity stunt which is another reason why ppl hate it but also what an absolute FAIL on her part because even though everyone's talking about this new rebrand ppl are still talking about the abuse and groomers she hangs out with and this information is now getting around to more ppl who originally had been indifferent to her cringe but now know she's like a bad person and actively dislike her. This just seems very short-sighted to deliver trash no one wants because you can only pull this dramatic stunt once before no one cares anymore.
“not kid friendly” then says effed up 😭😭 shut up
LOL THIS IS CRACKING ME UP BUT WHERE WAS JONATHON JOESTAR??!
1:10 😭 But fr its sad though, it's just kids trying to be kids...and I laughed at the mothers wanting peace and quiet...😂 I need those earbuds myself
I think that her trying to be ‘grown up’ the way she’s presenting it just seems immature tbh
It is giving sheltered child rebelling by doing what they think the "cool kids" do but also not wanting their mom to be TOO mad. Honestly surprised the song doesn't have the word "frick" in it
9:30 this is like the most ive seen chad chad move
She’s just doing this to cover up her abusing those young dancers
9:11 , I was only listening to the video and my heart stopped for a bit when I heard this until she said from Stardew Valley
Stardew is pretty hype these days ngl
no way she said gay pop then said MILEY CYRUS 😭😭😭😭
The fact it’s technically not her song (she has rights but she didn’t write it) like dude
Britney Spears (and her dancers) routinely did 12 hour rehearsals in the run up to performances & videos.
chad chad ur my fav yt frrrrr keep it up I LOVE U GIRL :D
Can’t wait until you react to the music video 😭
That’s about the best darn kiss cosplay I’ve ever seen 😊
the fact that she stole the song too 💀💀
I think the thing that urks me is that she wears "edgy" like a costume. Like it's so clear that she's just playing this like a part in order to escape being seen as a child star rather than actually finding her real identity as an adult.
Chad Chad dancing was not on my bingo card but I'm so glad it happened
this video needed a warning at the start for those who were eating because I chocked on my food while trying not to laugh at the beautiful, artistic editing when chad chad tried to dance like jojo
her song is from brit smith karma‘s a bit**
The fact that she just bought someone else's released song too... She didn't even write it 😭
The fact that she didn’t even write the song at all 💀
She’s trying to act like any attention is good attention but.. she’s killing her brand
Guys can we just appreciate how pretty Chad chad is 😍
omg was that a jojo reference??
jojo with no bow looks weird
i watched the music video at 3am now im traumatized😭😭😭
I'm only at 1:33 rn so idk what you talked about in this video but here are some things I'd like to say  1: I first saw Jojo siwa in star stable, I still have her bow hairs 2: her new 'era' looks like two modern goths had a baby and their 23x great grandmother was tradgoth 3: The way she said she invented gay pop for this era and how it was scary like no, the only scary thing here is how you dry humped that one girl in the video for Karma 4: She said she wrote the song when she only changed the lyric from messed to effed  And yeah those are my opinions on Jojo siwa
Did she not do her outro ? What a shame for the chad comunity.
ur version is way better
great, another video about jojo siwa 😅 definitely not extremely over hearing about her or anything…. sorry but this is a skip for me. I cannot stand when creators make videos about the same thing as everyone else. Like i understand it’s a popular topic so they want the views/engagement, but personally I don’t need to watch 10 videos talking about the same. exact. thing.
She talks a big game but doesn't deliver much .
Jojo Sewa Grew Up 🤯
I think the issue with Jojo's music is that she doesn't know who she is. She went from playing her childhood character to now trying to play this edgy character but nothing she's made has any soul. She's trying way too hard to put on a certain show and it seems disingenuous and silly.   I also feel like Jojo is going through what a lot of people who recently came out go through which is that you're so excited to express your sexuality and be part of the gay community that you become unbearable 😂
9:12 STARDEW VALLEY MENTIONED 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔊RAHH🔊🗣️🗣️🔊🔊🔥
Yea nothing about her rebrand screams "edgy" to me. Child stars have been making this transition from "good kid to bad adult" for as long as anyone can remember. They've just never teased it. Which, btw, is how to do a successful rebrand. Teasing a rebrand ENDLESSLY and still acting like it's some giant secret is so...yikes. Especially when her new look doesn't match her in the slightest.
She Garth Brooks’d out like when he switched to Chris Gaines
i don't think she's ever heard of hyperpop
9:10 KISS AND SMOOCH HARVEY SOOOOO REEEEALLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ngl, I was never a fan of her, but it was nice to see her enjoying her old image of wearing big bows, etc. Iirc she was made fun for not growing out of it, and it was nice to see her stick to what she wanted to do.  I hope she's happy with this rebrand, though.
7:08 there is a German plate on the BMW it tells me, the owner of this car lives in Munich
MY EYES SOMEBODY HELP ME!! 😭😭😭😭
Whatever happened to Maddie? I always thought 🤔 she was going to be the one making videos.. jojo is too much for me
she stole the song . its not even hers
what in the theater kid is this?
love u forever chadchad thank u for making me cackle every time
Love Chad Chad❤
I don’t think Jojo honestly knows how to be an adult after being in the spotlight since she was like 10. Kinda sad tbh she’s doing what she thinks and adult would act like
I dont know jojo siwas other drama stuff, but jeez let em be cringe with their art 😢
This uhhh superficially gives me sarah lynn vibes
“ I’m friends with Shane Dawson” OH MY GOD😮
I recorded two of my freinds doing the karma dance and they way they did it was the funniest shit ever even though it wasn’t and my humor is broken.
7:07 Car was spittin bars
proof it’s not good for a kid to grow up well known
anything less than grindcore music would've been disappointing at this point
Congrats on the 69th video. I don’t know about you guys but that’s pretty nice
i cant at the comment "girl there's nothing left to spoil at this point" 😂
Apparently the girl who was told to just 'cover up' her bleeding has spina bifida. I also have it and that was definitely a medical emergency, and you NEED breaks when you have spina bifida. That's messed up beyond belief.
5:21 love the music "archimedes" from the tf2 soundtrack!! Good video btw
''dancing like a spider ice skating'' describes the dance style
I laughed so hard that my tea went out from my nostrils lol
The part i like the most is that her videoclipe has only her and lots of women.... And women i like that
How can she not know who Gene Simmons is?!  That's like a dedication to ignorance when you literally work in the music industry.
her makeup looks like venomized state fair makeup
Amazing Video... but why Harvey- like he won't even compensate for your medical bills after marriage, you still have to pay those. I loved the video though, I'm just questioning your Stardew Valley choices
4:07 YOUR EARRINGS ARE SO PRETTY :O     (..link?🤔🥺🙏)
I want to listen to the original song by Jojo. Honestly? I like it. It's catchy
I feel like the song ironically is predicting the future,she will face repercussions for treating people so badly [cheating on ex gf]
she just think's she's adam lambert from 2014 it's fine
''giant pp plushie'' faith in humanity ruined once again......
this is the best part of this video 12:23
spongebob:''I'm gonna tell your MOM,mr krabs!''
''oooh,you said number 11!''  🐬
Love the casual stripper pole in the living room 😂
it's like someone saw that one cruella qoute: ''I guess everyone thought I'd turn into some sort of psycho'' and ran with it 🥴
2:14 "Traumatic scenarios"? Your ass does NOT know what the word means, do you?
I’m pretty sure hyperpop is gay pop
I once read a tweet that said she was like a little lesbian Jake Paul
She's trying to distract from the controversies of her TV show ...and it's working tbh which is incredibly frustrating. "I'm ab*sing children but don't look at that bECASUE I'M AN EDGEY ADULT NOW!!"
I love that my favorite YouTubers are talking abt Jojo rn😭
JoJo: whats been in your head the last few days? 😏  Me: young lady, i have to figure how to hire 5 more daylight nurses on my unit and hoping no one else gets fired or quits. I also have to think about my unit moving towards legal hold status and the emotional toll of that process is a lot. I also am constantly worried about my elderly mother and her increasing needs. Not to mention me needing to find a new GI doctor as im worried some things are getting worse and Im already pretty bad off. Also i have taxes due and i hate it
"I'm gonna invent a new genre"
Please tell me the difference between gay pop and pop.
MOTHER POSTED‼️
It’s such a huge problem that I notice now when artist just over-post and publicize teasers and clips of their new songs. Like- DUDE IM ALREADY BORED OF IT AND IT HASNT EVEN BEEN RELEASED
aaa were your videos always going at the ADHD speed of johnny test? i am overwhelmed lmao
WHATS GOING ON OVER JOJO… 💀💀
jojo fr thinks she's from kiss or something
chadchad is the only chad on youtube that ever makes me physically laugh
😂 you’re hilarious
Lmao "nobody has done this before" when Miley is RIGHT THERE 😂
u should see the original and how its not even her own song
I can't believe she's grinding on other girls in the video wow how polarizing and controversial
i hope they did all this marketing and the music comes out and its the same like kiddy girl pop stuff. that would be like the prank for the ages
HARVEY STARDEWVALLEY GIRLIES SOUND OFF 🎉❤
She’s a strawberry bop, just like her cereal
kind of very disappointing to see that a gay girl being in the spotlight of like kids things and probably be shamed to hell and back for being gay is now being shamed for trying to come out of her shell and switch up her everything... I think there is so much to explore in just that instead of talking her down like that for being so "cringy" so what? (Tho I also don't know much more then this) I just think she should be allowed to explore this without everyone constantly shitting on what young woman are doing? esp those in the public eye?  just read the things about stealing the song... well... that takes away a lil from my point.... oop
she didn’t even write the song, she bought it off of someone else and then just made it worse and lied and said she wrote it when she really fucking didn’t
didnt she steal the song from some other artist?? im pretty sure the song isnt even hers
This is sad.. im sacred for this person, their mother seems very odd and controlling. idk if making fun of them is a good idea :( this is a cause for valid concern
i got banned on roblox vc for singing jojo siwas karma i think that shows that this song is verrryyyy explicit
“JOJO! HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING!” -Abby Lee Miller
literally no-one's gone with the term 'Jojo's Circus' and frankly, I'm a little disappointed.
5:15 tf2 spotted (the track "a little heart to heart" from meet the medic can be heard playing in the background)
She's taken the persona of 2017 version of Jake and Logan Paul
CHAD CHAD IS BACK AGAIN
You have to make a video on gubba homestead
Chad Chad's dance was so much better, she should replace Jojo
Your version is better 😂
She fr said it’s not a phase mom😂
I personally don't have a problem w/ the song Karma (Jojo didn't write it, not even a single word).  Jojo's the problem.
Sure this isnt all a cover up? Like iNabber said?
Chad Chad is so millennial core even tho I think she’s old GenZ or young millennial. I bet she’s a hufflepuff, no shade.
What is extreme and dramatic, is the use of those fake tattoos.  Nothing screams “bad girl” like a plethora of small stick on tattoos.
Totally off topic but I LOVE your deer shirt 😂
Our Harvey agenda has reached chad chad 🔥🔥 ONE OF US ONE OF US🗣🔥🔥
The noel miller "EEEEW" at the end was killer
this is the 2020s version of shadow the hedgehog (the game) they might as well give her a gun atp
Omg jojo got hit by a boomerang
wait so if shes the “gay pop icon” then why does she have a d*ck plush
Another YouTuber being unoriginal and joining in on a group bully session. Ewwww, unsubscribing from this channel
Her dumbass saying she bad think how low she literally discriminated to others literally is girl child with low standards and motivation for a rapper child star beside gay male batter attend with metal edgy horror than this disgusting Christian catholic low brainer
The thing is, I actually love the original version of Karma from Brit, maybe it’s cause the instrument and vocals are so much better, or maybe it’s cause I hate Jojo 😭 But seriously, the lyrics make much more sense in the context of it being a confession
Harvey???  the broke older guy who is into planes, coffee and telling you unsolicited advices to eat healthier ?
Okay but the pnis plushie is kinda cute tho
No outro thank you? Chad chads bad girl era has begun.
I honestly thought she was making a reference to Kiss.
The most shocking thing in this video wasn't JoJo siwa at all it was that I thought the alien cake poster had ripped omg I was in tears
I feel like you and Kurtis Connor are two sides of the same coin
i was not prepared for that music video 💀
I think a big thing with Jojo is she's not acknowledging the queer musicians that came before her. She's trying way hard to make seismic shifts like Bowie did, but she is not hitting the nail on the head. She is flaunting her sexuality like it's making her an icon but Freddie Mercury, Elton John and George Michael all came before and are known for their music, not just for being queer. anyways I can go on but yeah
9:12 !!! yesss a fellow harvey lover
Babe, wake up!! ChadChad posted!
Jojo in 2014 🌈 Jojo in 2024 🏳️‍🌈
No! The human version of a glow stick is obviously N A O M I   from wwe/nxt 🥰
watching from an reaction type of video and i still can vomit
12:24 RAAAÆEEH
the most important thing is she never effed around
hell yeah chad chad's a harvey fan
Random conspiracy time: what is up with this song? Seriously. Everyone I talk to says they heard it once and then it immediately got stuck in their heads for hours/days/a week. I also did not ask for it to be played endlessly in my YT shorts. Why is this song so easily taking over people’s minds and who did she pay for it to ALSO take over our feeds??? Everyone is talking about her and I never wanted to care but suddenly I do. wtf??
Why is she talking like Jake Paul
Harvey!?!?!? Of all people??? not even GUS?!?!! man's leaves out food for Linus but you wanna go with HARVEY??? Wild.
Never heard about Jo Jo before, but I love the cinicism of your vídeos lol and the effort such as dancing hahahha
Should we even give attention to this kind of "artist"?
Well, to be honest, Id look to her past more and mby you will dig more info. For example her paycheck compared to paycheck of those who had other roles but same important, if she could even use her name without it being just for the show and so on. From what I know, she was under all those stuff and COULD NOT be whom she wanted (herself) and this is probably just revolution. If shes happy with what shes doing, its great in my opinion
I honestly pity Jojo. As someone who works with kids, they're sooo easy to manipulate and groom at a young age. We dont even know what happens behind the cameras like Quiet on Set so we don't know what her personality was up until now. No way in the nine levels of hell am I defending her whatsoever as it's been explained how she and her mother exploiited children yet do you really think Jojo has full control of the reins? Her mother, who has ALLOWED her minor of a child, to be "friends" with adult child predators and smart manipulators.  Now Jojo is walking on the same red stained path and it's genuinely disgusting. Similar to Drake Bell with his situation, you'd never know if the atmosphere is scary unless you're the observant type and spot out the signs like Drake's dad. Though unlike him, Jojo's been around those people from Dance Moms to now and boy did their skills do a number on her. Whether she knows it or not, if Jojo contines doing what her "friends" have done, and possibly still doing, she WILL become one of them.   She's 20 years old now, a year younger than me, and hopefully later in life she figures it out before it's too late. However it may take years given her situation 🤷🏾‍♂️
So you didn’t invent “gay pop” if you can list a bunch of examples of what you mean.
I think since she was always forced to be a child/act like a child as her whole brand, this is her finally growing into her awkward emo middle school phase.. except as a 20 year old woman
OMFG CHAD CHAD IS THE AVATAR?!?!? 9:46
"No one has made this dramatic of a change yet" and then releases a song that already exists
10:51 Chad Chad renaming Jessalyn and going with it is priceless
Did she forget lil nas x giving Satan a lap dance?
Ah yes the abused to abuser pipeline
I hate you as much as I hate jojo
the second Jojo takes of her bow: "I WAS A BAD GIRL"
You now have 69 videos 😃
Pre-edge Jojo was the personification of every single Lisa Frank item.
so my issue, without judging either her mental state or her as a person, is this:  her style screams young adult comic book villain, which actually could be a fun theme to run with because it can be an awesome aesthetic,  but she then tries to sell us on the aesthetic by sounding like a teenager trying to be deep.  She literally could've played into the vibe and tried to be mysterious with it, or play up the drama... but there's no hype for the aesthetic or the theme, it's all "me me me" and no substance to enhance the flare, so then it ... just feels like a really shitty one woman show that no one needed to see. I think I'd be more behind her if she had just owned it and went "Hey I'm a young adult in charge of my life and I'm ready to get weird with it for a bit, so saddle up" lol. Like that's fair at least bitch
YOU’RE A HARVEY LOVER!?
I just think it’s funny how she said she wrote the song but the song was written for Miley long long ago
Im sad that she doesnt do the twinge of cringe in those high pitch voices anymore 😔
Avatar Chad is my favorite.
I honestly feel kind of bad for her. Like a lot of dance mom girls she seems to be so under the thumb of her abusive, controlling mom and maybe doesn’t even realize it. Now that definitely doesn’t excuse any abusive behavior she was complicit in enabling or participating in, but she has grown up with such a distorted view of what work life balance is and how she has to be nonstop PR promo 24/7 … it is messed up that society allows this shit to continue to happen. I hope she has a proverbial come to Jesus moment gets out of it before things get way worse and before she’s irrevocably messed up.
there should have been a cringe warning because I physically recoiled from my desk every time she came on screen
I’m so confused
You're a Harvey girl?  Unsubscribed
Swear YouTube stopped showing me your videos and I couldn’t find this channel for a solid 6 months
I really think she is on to something
This is what trying to hard looks like, and it’s not working.
Almost shit my pants. Made it just in tome
This Adventure of Jojo's Siwa is Bizzare (10:26 Love the reference 😍)
12:23 😂😂😂😂😂😂
SHE DIDNT DO HER OG OUTRO 😰😰😭😭😭
chad chad would be a monster at just dance
you know it’s bad when Chad Chad makes a video on it
as a lesbian the humping made me straighter and more homophobic 😭
So.... she's still for children. Disney channel version of edgelord, catered to a young audience. Even Chad Chad casually walking in her home with a t-shirt feels more badass than Jojo's parody.
Girl I mean…youre like 20, we get it, youre not gonna wear bows and tiaras anymore, it’s not that big of a deal get over yourself. Why are you so DRAMATIC? YOU DONT HAVE TO DRESS LIKE THE KISS DARK METAL VERSION OF URSULA, YOUR NAME IS JOJO FOR CHRIST’S SAKE STOP
11:22 GOD i hate this. as a huge swiftie, it just made me full body cringe. like, cringing so hard my skin peels off. taylor doesn’t deserve this level of disrespect 😔
Chad Chad loving Harvey from Stardew Valley almost as mush as I do makes me love being a subscriber even more
even logan paul's switch in content was less cringe
The Car singing Lose Yourself is crazyyy 😂
I also have a cat named Bones :)
This is all the work of a publicity agent and a career manager. This is probably none of JoJo's doing at all. She was told to do this to make a living and she did it. This is a circus act. News flash. Nobody goes to the circus anymore either. The terrible thing here is that she actually looks uncomfortable doing all of this ( hence the super overcompensation at every turn)  like she is being forced to do this to pay the bills. She says she's gay. I would like to see a woman come into her life that loves her and takes her away from all of this media exploitation. I see a good person getting crushed under all that black makeup. Hollywood really must be a live version of Hell now.
Tfw her whole rebrand is just the kidzbops version of Miley Cyrus's bangerz era.
Beetlejuice Is NOT fooling anyone 💀💀💀🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Honestly someone needs to step in get her away from everyone that is just using her for money. Make her like go to college, get normal 20 year old friends, and go through her lesbian drama without a camera in her face. Like give the girl a chance to actually develop a personality that isn't making money and hanging out with youtube predators.
Jojo aside thank you for the Harvey appreciation, he deserves it
Chadvatar: the last chad bender
I agree with the kissing Harvey for 12 hours. He's my favorite.
I'm not buying it, I don't know a single bad girl who doesn't know who Gene Simmons is
HELP I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD IN THE BEGINNING THAT I DROPPED MY PHONE INTO MY PANCAKES AND SYRUP 😭
She literally has 21M on yt already
2:19 "flip then dog" ahh move
Good Lord she looks like a WWE wrestler in that get-up
I mean at least she’s doing what she can to separate herself from the younger audiences before switching things up. I feel like if she jumped right into making things that aren’t appropriate for kids with no warning, people would be upset about that instead. If we’ve learned anything from recent scandals, colleen for example, you shouldn’t mix inappropriate content with a young audience. Sure it’s cringe but it seems like she’s trying to be responsible in that way. Maybe even because of her proximity to colleen and not wanting to make the same mistakes.
What I have learned from this video: Chad Chad is the next Avatar 9:46
facts about jojo:  1. after years of dance, her choreography is still ABYSMAL  2. her new look is awful  3. she didn’t even write her song  4. ew.
Errrrm chad chad might be the avatar
5:06 "fiddle sticks"💀💀
Jojo dances like it's the "collard greens" meme
the lyrics make so much more sense when you realize this was a song that was supposed to be released over ten years ago. it feels a lot like a knock off avril lavigne song. also the fact that jojo said she got inspiration from miley cyrus is so laughable considering this song was written for miley cyrus but she didn’t want it😭
also, isn't that song, like, almost completely stolen from another artist?
oh look more of the same fucking video covering the same fucking thing with the same fucking format. some stupid white youtuber smack dab in the middle of their thumbnail like they're the main subject. imagine being so full of yourself that you think your gross narcissistic face will get you clicks. and of COURSE it's sponsored, using someone else's life as content. get a real job, you disgusting leech
Homegirl went through Dance Moms and one break up and she's letting the world know now 🗣💀
Shes like the female version of when peter parker goes all mean and edgy in spiderman 3. Only less edgy.
It’s giving nightman 🦹🏻‍♂️
Amazing to learn that chad chad is a harvey girlie
Gonna be honest: I'm kind of annoyed with the dog-piling on Jojo that's happening right now.   Younger Zoomers and people in the Alpha range, whatever --  most of them are too young to have participated in the other times we've done this to child stars becoming adults. But with people my age (late twenties) and up... why are we doing this?   Like, did we not learn our lesson after doing this to Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, etc?   Yes, Jojo is engaging in some cringe behavior, but she's 20 ffs. I wouldn't want to be judged for decisions I made in my mid-twenties, let alone that young.   So, I dunno, maybe let's stop perpetuating this ultimately, when we get down to the source, misogynist behavior?   Not trying to bash your content, but I'm really not a fan of people (particularly anyone over the age of like, 27) ganging up on this person who's basically still a kid and was raised in abusive circumstances. Just my two cents.
I have somehow managed to completely avoid knowing anything about jojo siwa until today and I thank the good lord that I had as long as I did. This is horrendous and kind of sad
Jojo is a good example when it seems like your inspirations come from only the worst youtubers and not actually talented artists.  She idolized people like Colleen Ballinger and Shane Dawson instead of talents like taylor swift or any of the artists Chad Chad referenced in the video that had a similiar rebranding lol
Your dog chills in his crate with the door open too? If I leave my dogs kennel open, he goes in. However, it's usually after he's peed somewhere he's not allowed to pee so I guess he puts himself in timeout on purpose
Miley Cyrus 2.0 but even more annoying
It's sickening she'd copycat a band she knows nothing about
6:25 BYE LOOK AT THE CAR SEATS 😭😭
Holy shit I’m wearing that same shirt right now! 3 deer
I'm once again blown away by how well taylor swift changes eras / vibes.  When jojo is a perfect example of how easily it can look bad or cringey lol It's like night and day production value >_<
The humping part was traumatizing
Why is Markiplier just staring in the corner and why did you not use his image for click bait
not to mention the song isn’t even hers ☠️ she’s painting this as her hugeee rebrand and new song but the song was written by Brit Smith in 2012
honestly the only good thing about her rebrand is that we can make BIZZARE references about jojos adventures
Fun fact - she said she wrote the song and she stole it. It’s a cover Jojo. That doesn’t meant you WROTE IT OVER 30 years ago
It’s like she’s cosplaying a Justin Bieber and Ellen crossbreed
coming up from the ocean was p cool though, very death stranding. another reference she probably doesnt know.
Not knowing who gene Simmons is crazy. Hate my generation
She was so cute on Dance Moms. I never watched but I've seen clips. Looks like she needs to touch some grass and get it together. Poor thing.
Was waiting for this kne lol
HARVEY WHY HARVEY
Chad Chad airbending with a pelvic thrust
your editing is honestly so good that the videos seem 5 minutes long cause it's so good
thought we were making fun of a teenager for being well...a teenager, but then i found out she's 20. hell yeah, lets cringe.
Jojo lost her mojo...no more mojo jojo
her new costume looks like Sam raimi's symbiote suit as opposed to the regular one
So basically she’s doing a “Miley Cyrus”
i know jojo siwa was only 10yo when wrecking ball came out, but COME ON, she can't seriously think that her kiss-sona is the most shocking rebranding of a girl pop star yet 🙃
We should make a cringe award for the Grammys so people stop trying to get attention for the wrong reasons.
Hello chadchad youtuber chadchadd
I can't wait to see Claire's rebrand to keep up with their mascot!
Don't worry kids, all of the 40-somethings let out a collective 'sigh' when she announced it. I'm surprised you didn't hear us. 😂
Maybe the big surprise is that she collaborated with Kanye and dropped a hard R on the track
This is not the JoJos Bizarre Adventure i meant.
jojo siwa….. said…. the word shit….. she really IS a bad girl! she told us! obviously i’m kidding.  this isn’t even her song. it’s another artists song that she bought and covered word for word.
10:26 this whole jojo siwa fiasco topped with endless jojo rederences is making my jojo infested brain go crazy (in a good way)
I think what most people don't like is that she is known to hang out with creeps, she stole the karma song from someone else, and also abused disabled kids.
Was not expecting the avatar bending to the dance moves lol 😂😂😂
I love that she tried to become 18+ but 10 year old girls still sing her songs. I had a dance recital and had to share a dressing room with a bunch of 10 year old girls and they were all singing karma and just substituting the swear words for other stuff. JOJO YOU LITERALLY FAILLLEEDDD
i love u for making this baby
to make it worse, she didnt even write the song
Jojo didn't even write Karma. It was written for Miley Cyrus and she rejcted it
Thank you for this video masterpiece Chad Chad! I love the music video editing, and the photo collage was *Chef's Kiss* perfect lol
This is the biggest plot twist ever
"What's been in your head the last 3 days?"      THIS JUICE CLEANSE WAS A BAD IDEA!!
She’s dressed as the enemy stand user
I love the harvey reference
dudeeeeee Harvey from stardew valley mentioneddd
NGL when I first saw that in the Karma MV It scared the sh*t out of me-
HARVEY FROM STARDEW VALLEY MENTIONED
It’s also the fact that she claimed she wrote the song Karma herself when all she did was buy the rights to it…
I mean it's very common actually for childstars to break out of their innocent childfriendly persona and she was far from having this drastic of an image change either so... The music isn't even bad and I can get the willingness to break out of your old glittery child image, but the marketing has been suuuuuper dumb :')
Better watch out you might get a copyright infringement for playing the actual song in this video
“well that had music and video” is my favorite review of anything ever thank you for your insightful commentary
how is she gonna sit there like “I want to invent a new genre of music” and then LIST EXAMPLES OF MUSIC THAT ALREADY EXISTS??
I feel like… why would you name your single karma when one of the biggest pop stars in the world just released a hit single called karma not even two years ago?  Like… I’m not even a Swiftie but I’d be scrambling to change that.
i swear you could make her whole song with all her tiktoks she made
The That’s Cringe reference is amazing
jojos jojos jojos jojos jojos jojos bizzare adventure (gone bad)
I love the fact that you tried  to sing the song badly  but it still sounds  100% better than jojo
AYYYYY SDV HARVEY APPRECIATION
The whole like group synchronized dancing thing is so weird. It’s just probably one of the worst choreographies I’ve ever seen in a music video. She’s just talentless. 😅
Gay Pop was already unleashed by a gay man giving a lap dance to Satan….. I’m not sure anyone remembers Lil Nas X……
Whatever she's doing, it's working! People can't stop making videos about her
The copyright safe version is incredible sounds better than the actual song lol 😂❤
LOOK MOMMY!!!! I’m a Lesbian NOW!!!
If everyone hates it, why are y'all milking it for content instead of just ignoring her? But rather give her more attention. Like, I'm not a fan but I also don't like the idea of the whole Internet going against one person.
after watching those dance moves i can say i have a crush on chad chad
she trying to do what lil nas x did, with the switch from old town road( mainly enjoyed by kids) to montero (very sexual)
Chad Chad: where's the humping? I wanna see the humping.  Also Chad Chad: *is immediately disgusted*   Chad, why do you do this to yourself?
12:46 I don´t know if you did it on purpose but you looked exactly like the meme of the nerd guy drawing pointing backwards lmaooo
No one - Nobody - Chad Chad - where's the humping? I wanna see the humping.
13:16 i seen u @codyko @noelmiller
Girl we need some light ( use the sun it's free ) the lighting is Killing me . Some light won't hurt 😀
honestly, however mild the lyrics may be, I don't think she was lying when she said she was scared to sing them. I remember when she came out and went on some podcasts to talk about her sexuality, she was very careful to warn any kids to click away before she went into too much mature detail. she seemed very aware that her audience might be watching and that her audience is children.bnow, I don't really know if this caution comes from actual concern for her young fans or fear of backlash from parents, but it's definitely there. so I understand why she would be afraid of a career change like this, not because it's actually super extreme, but just because of the inevitable backlash of people who wanted her to be PG forever.
Honestly it would havve been better if she went 'dark rainbow' as a theme instead. More of a transition than the same dress-up sparkle except *gasp* black face-paint. Would especially work on her hair, from blonde neat ponytail to loose dark with muted colour sheen like on oil.   There isn't actually anything edgy in her 'new look'. No hair dye, no hairstyle change (that can't be undone by a wash and taking clips out), no skin showing (everything risque is covered with cloth to spare and the rest is in dark netting), no real outfit change (its just a net jumpsuit).   The jumpsuit might even have worked if she threw a leather jacket and big boots on over it, but no, that might actually enter butterknife edge territory.
"where was the humping? i wanted to see humping"
to be honest chad chad's version of the song hits soo different
This is like the Robin Sparkles to Robin Daggers rebrand
Not Chad Chad bending all four elements. Aang wants to know your location 🕶️🚨
Sorry, Srah Lynn did it better...
Can't wait till she's irrelevant and the jojo people think about when someone says Jojo is those guys who went on a bizarre adventure.
9:48 NOT HER TURNING INTO THE AVATAR
"Mother's day is coming up" chad2 it's April😦
AAAHH UNRELATED BUT I LOVE YOUR SHIRT
It's actually sad. Shes still manipulated by her mother into this... marketable object. Brainwashed since she was a kid.
every single singer ever has had that era where they try something super different than their usual stuff in order to experiment and find out where they want to lay 🤒 why is she trying to be special girl bye,,
It really does feel like a 2008 ex-Disney star song.
The boomerang came back and gave her a concussion
Im too old for this shit, thanks for eleven months of subscription
Dove Cameron had such a nice switch from Disney star to more adult content and a switch. Jojo is just kidsbop emo
Didn't dove cameron also do... exactly this? The gay bad girl arc except she was actually hot 😭🙏
I don't even get what's supposed to be the edgy part. That she kissed a girl? I guess that might be controversial in some very conservative circles, but that's definitely not rare to see in media today. It's not really rare to see a gay character in a TV-series, for an example.
She associates herself with known creeps like Colleen, James, and Shane. Her and her mom mistreated and exploited dozens of children through their show. This is just a new statement to try and hide her gross ignorance
Your parody cover was unironically better lol
The fact that this song wasn’t even originally sang by her. The original is by Brit Smith in 2012. This version is sooo much better
KARMA IS NOT EVEN HER SONG!! & JOJO LITERALLY STOLE ANOTHER ARTISTS SONG AND VOCALS!! SHES STEALING MUSIC FROM OTHER ARTISTS! A FAKE, THIEF & CRINGY AS F!! The crappy Kiss make up isn’t a look SMH
Finally someone with good taste in men, Harvey for life
the humping in the music video scarred my life
She looks like she tried to be kiss and just failed so hard
I think the ponytail was a little bit too tight…. 💀
as a queer person, it’s so insulting for Jojo to say that she’s “inventing” queer music. as if freddie mercury, hayley kiyoko, and countless other queer artists haven’t put their all into making -actually good- queer music all these years.
You can tell Jojo had no creative control in this when a Gene Simmons imitation has no idea they look like Gene Simmons.
This really feels like a 12 year old in her rebelling/edgy era
9:45 avatar chad cha !!
Nah, JoJo just got hit with a stand arrow
Also for people wondering another reason why people are mad about the rebrand and song is because the song was already sang by Brit smith just unreleased so jojo didn’t actually write it about one of her exes like she claims
And now everyone's gonna talk even more shxt about her and we'll get another Britney and blah blah, the cycle continues.
Jojo did not just say that Karma is the Applause by Lady Gaga😦 She even compared Karma to Miley Cyrus { 3:01 }
It's like if Peter Chris, and Mary's brother, Warren, kid a DBZ fusion! What, with the makeup, bizarre hand gestures, and half closed eyes routine. Oh! And love of tacky costumes!    No offense to cat fancier drummers, and people with certain conditions.
9:11 ❤❤🥺🥺❤
This was an absolute masterpiece 🤌🏼 10/10 chef
love the new brainrot style of your videos 👍
Jojo’s “new look” makes me think she is trying to look like GFlip 😶
Gene Simmons called. He wants his makeup kit back.
My friend’s has kep saying “I was a bad girl”
Does Jojo realise that even Swifties think the talking part of Look What You Made Me Do is cringy as hell?
omg where did you get this giant dinosaure plushi ?????    yes I am aware I don't know how to spell pushy-plushi-plushie aaaaah
Playing Stardew as I'm watching this and I would also like to kiss and smooch Harvey for 12 hours straight
SHE LOOKS LIKE AN EMO STARFISH NOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE UNICORN BOW JOJO??!!
This is the Disney channel equivalent of a "bad" girl... or like, if someone asked a five year old to draw a "bad girl", they'd draw JoJo's new fit in crayon.
Her doing KISS-like makeup and the KISS-like tongue movement but not knowing who Gene Simmons is, is like someone wearing a Metallica t-shirt and thinking it's a brand instead of a band.
It 100% feels like this is a cover/distraction for other allegations and drama surrounding her (think her becoming the new Abby Lee Miller, bullying her employees, apparently also abspestos?) that she had very little say in. You can see in all of the interviews that, while she's decent at *trying* to bullshit her story, she doesn't seem to buy it. She's still a bubbly child star under all of that discount Kiss makeup and that figure skater's leotard...she simply hasn't figured out who she is and is catching a lot of flack for it. I still think she should absolutely catch flack for other things (bullying her employees, happily hanging out with knwon predators, etc) but this is nowhere near a 'Miley moment' and should not be given that much credit or early-credit.
Chad: I wanna see the humping! Chad when the humping: 😨🫢🫥
ChadChad: The Last ChoreoBender......... 😂😂😂😂😂😂
sitting chad chad makes me hightly uncomfortable
i love you chadchad thank you for gracing us with yet another amazing video😩🙏🏻
hey can you super please do a video about dance moms lol derp :3 PLEASE I'M ON MA KNEES  Thank You! lol derp :3 (this is not how i talk in real life)
Chad Chad posting is my favourite thing ever
EMINEM MENTIONED?!??!?!?
I prefer your version
Watching this sixteen hours late!! :33
did you put in the avatar bending effects because you've been playing the new fortnite update
8:30 am I hearing some a hat in time there?
thanks for using stanley parable elevator music such a vibe....no ones made that much of a transition in their video in this generacion oui oui furiel furiel 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 y24 y24
6:12 i only then realised there was STANLEY PARABLE MUSIC in the background
THE FUCKING AVATAR EDITING TOOK ME OUT
The song is so bad but it stucks in my head wtf
i only watch the music video once,its traumatize me.
The fact too, that JoJo completely STOLE word after word from another artist and calls this her song…
🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯
Who's gonna tell her she can't sing its giving look at me energy
.... Ima come back like a boomerang...
"Nobody's ever made a change this dramatic"  Britney, Christina, Nelly Furtado, Lindsay Lohan, Miley Cyrus, just to name a few from the top of my head...
The way Jojo is trying so hard to show everyone she is a now changed person is the equivalent of a 6-year-old showing their parents a "new dance move" they made
She’s giving not being able to decide between the cute or goth version of Who’s That Chick
i love how all these supposedly left channels piling on hate for her just because they think shes cringe
She feels like the rainbow equivalent of the "Normal People Scare Me" t-shirt wearing types
HARVEY?????
jojo's trying to be like every singer but fails,  let's look at every singer, miley cyrus succeeds, justin timberlake former member of the mickey mouse club and nsync  succeeds and so on and so forth.
The fact its not even her song and she's not saying anything about it is crazy haha
I watched the lead singer of gwar pretend to inhale the penis of a fried palestinian on stage while they sprayed fake blood on the crowd and Jojo siwa makes me want to vomit
11:29 i have emailed all my friends that wonderous image of jojo siwa holding a giant penis at 4:28 am
Emotionally scarred. Thanks Chad Chad ❤❤ ❤ ❤ the dry humping is so....... 🙃 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀
I wonder if this extreme rebrand thing that happens, isn't on purpose to make the real rebrand do better.
The fact the she didn't even write the song 😭 all of this for something that's not even hers
To me it just seems like a case of a sheltered kid who is only seeing just now discovering the world around for what it is.
im surprised that chad chad is not sponsored by dragon city
We demand More dancing with the elements chadchad 👏👏
Its giving Disney descendents
Omg the stardew valley reference 😭🥺  Personally I'm team Sebastian lol
Jojo’s bizzare rebranding
Omg chad chad and funky frog bait are literally the same person
I wonder why no one challenges her. Like, even for the sake of spectacle or whatever, when she says she wants to “invent gay pop” as a journalist just ask: what about Queen? What about “I kissed a girl” by Katy Perry? What about the literal entirety of the already existing genre? If she says she doesn’t know any of it just break the news to her in front of everyone that she isn’t inventing anything. Surely that would get more interest in the interview? To actually give a good interview?
chavatar
I heard she didnt even write the song but stole it. What a mess LOL
U got a new subscriber!
Your dogs are so cute , i want to see more of them
Char chad post more please😢
This video is absolutely hilarious
Another case of why we should not encourage 'child stars' :(  Poor girl, hopefully in a few years she will seek help with her mental health.
she was a bald girl xdd
If only you would hate really awful males as you hate that young woman Ffs
Jojo has never heard a punk goes pop album before and it shows.
This gives me the same vibes as when I was 14 and pierced my ear with a safety pin and had my friend bring me an earring the next day. I felt like such a “crazy bad ass” but in truth, no one cared 😂😂
I am asbestos please stop thinking about me I don't like being in your brain
4:53 THE UNDERTALE MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND IM HOLLERING
It's truly one of the music videos of all time.
Lol love how she broke this down.. I don't know you or you're channel....but SUBSCRIBE AND LIKE CHAD CHAD ❤
3:11 so she wants to “invent” gay pop but then immediately lists several songs that already fit into the category.  Girl is so desperate.  But I’ll give it to her, that dance move of rolling back into a headstand was pretty sick.
All I can think of is she’s pulling a Miley Cyrus lol
I don’t know what it is, But Jojo seems like someone I’d hold my breath around. Like I don’t even want to breathe the same air as her.
i’ve never felt this level of second hand embarrassment
Your editing sits right with my brain and your commentary is tremendous 🤌 a delight to subscribe to 🎉
she looks like a knockoff version of rhea ripley and kiss
„the lyrics(…) kind of things we heard before”… maybe cause it’s not her song XD😂😂😂😂
Okay, hear me out.... Jake Paul + the Tramp Stamps = Jojo siwa
Imagine your mom coordinating your rebellion against your mom
Oh my...Chad Chad is the new avatar. Save us Chad.
Trying so hard to be miley while distracting everyone from all her horrible behavior
Well, I guess she doesn't really care about what they say-   But her reputation ain't coming back like a boomerang 💀
"what's been in your head the last 3 days" Magnetic by ILLIT , thankfully not Jojo's song 💀
So im guessing chadchad saw the tyler bender video and decides to make her own
am i the only one thinking of Sarah Lynn from Bojack Horseman?
she… doesn’t know… who Gene Simmons is? that is… infuriating lol.
11:21 why is she quoting Taylor Swift
someone in her comment section said "help! and island just lost its virginity"
Why does a car rapping make me so inexplicably happy
ii think the only child star that made a dramatic change was miley cyrus... esp when wrecking ball came out. Also, even billie eilish had a more dramatic change, and all she did was come out of the closet and start dressing in sexier clothes, also tattoo reveals
I also like to kiss and smooch Harvey from Stardew Valley
i love Shane Dawson lol
Chad chad got the dancing alien from smiling friends moves
oofff. well..... tragic
and you know what mothers would love.?.... some frickin peace and quiet... ahahah=)) you are one of the few that can always make a advertisement funny and not annoying to watch, thanks))
where is the "i appreciate you clicking on my video out of allllllllllllllllllllllll the other videos"!?!?!?!?!!???!??
I think she'll refine the image over time. I don't think I hate it as much as other people do, but then again I'm not a jojo fan so idc
Jojo needs to do stand reveal soon
Everything I know about Jojo siwa is against my will and also what's up with the flashing lights warning the crazy part is that someone must have complained about it someone was like you know what this video has too many flashing lights I can't let me take them to court
😂😂😂 looooove your non-copyrighted version 😂😂😂 🎉🎉🎉❤
9:41
I am deeply traumatized
Everyone talking about JoJo's transformation. No one say anything about Chad Chad coming to us as the new Avatar in 9:46. She truly mastered all four elements 😅
I kinda hate how gays memed her into becoming an icon since this stupid song. Starting from her being exploited as a child by her insane mom, everything about her sucks
Not another song💔💔💔💜
Chad Chad do you use they/them
"Most dramatic rebrand ever" *still badazzels hair*  Wait nevermind
9:12 I actually just married Harvey like 2 days ago
chad chad😎
Tbh I feel bad, she was clearly not able to have a proper childhood and now has to explore her own personality as a adult, for all we know this may not even be her choice
Gary glitter core is crazy
jojo is my new sleep paralysis demon
cleanse your brain, listen to Chappell Roan.
I got an ad for condom on this video. It was a lesbian couple. 😮
For some reason it really bothers me that she keeps throwing up the "metal horns" or whatever you want to call them. Not because "she's not allowed", but because she's marketing pop music. Not rock or metal. Its clear she just thinks the horns are edgy and mature
Babe wake up, Chad Chad just posted
She literally didn't "invent" gay pop and its pretty insulting that she thinks she did. Learn about your community, Jojo
10:02 everything was peaceful until the bone nation attacked
Isn't she like 13
Jojos probably put ketchup on her pants to make everyone think she's got her period early growing up 😭
"It was an accident", "You were an accident!" Made me laugh, thank you  But yeah Jojo lost my tolerance when she continued to defend disgusting people, she's no longer a kid with no clue about the world - she's old enough to have a responsibility to know which people she chooses to hang out with.
Jojo reference is strong with this one 🫣
9:47-10:10 is comedy gold.. I don't know which one funnier.. Chad breaking character after that weird wind twerk or the knee crack after that..
I love Chad Chad’s version of Karma more 😂😂
IM STILL HAPPY THAT SHE DID NOT CHANGE HER PFP look at jojo’s pfp Edit:bro if she made a new song than she can make her new car
one of my least favorite parts of this whole situations has got to be ppl suddenly forgetting how abusive and exploitative dance moms was like why am i seeing ppl backing and loving on jessalyn and abby lee miller.....
jojo is looking like those kids that are trying to act cool after watching a 18+ movie
I'm beginning to think she enjoys The Sex
problem is, she shouldn't have to keep saying she had a rebranding. THAT'S FOR THE AUDIENCE TO DECIDEE
Maybe she meant "I was a bald girl"
i can’t believe chad chad did not touch over what the story behind karma is - it is some crazy lesbian drama that took place on tiktok💀💀 jojo basically broke up a long term relationship amd then cheated on the girl she stole from someone else, and then the girl went back to her ex gf so now she’s mad lmao
She became the avatar just by dancing jojo's choreo 😭 (9:50)
0:10 What in the ass did she say
i hate how jojo just rebranded to shift the attention from the xomg pop drama, and she didnt write karma! it was originally an unreleased song in 2012 by brit smith smhh
"im gonna invent a new genre" *literally copies Karma's a bitch by Brit Smith*
chad chad: my knee hurts  also chad chad: 9:54
CHAD WE MISSED U!!!!
she isn't edgy its not her, she is struggling to find her true self which is smth i am dealing with she doesn't know how she wants to act or dress like. Its hard. (And there is nothing wrong with LGBTQ)
I'm just glad there was a jojo reference in this video at least one
The fact that its not even her song makes it even more hilarious and cringe. its a scrapped miley cyrus and brit smith song
Why does the red one on the beach kinda look like a bloody tampon..
Disney version of Gene Simons goes hard
Jojo is a few months older than I am, turning 21 in May, but with this weird edgy rebrand, everytime I look at her I can't help but see her as 16 at oldest. Even if she's trying to act "adult", it still just reads as somewhat childish. Like a young girl's idea of what grown up and edgy is.
Jojo is going through won't most of us went through at 13...
Does she have friends? Like I'm serious. Or anyone that can ground her a bit and tell her to chill. I feel bad for her honestly.
Why you in such a rush to end your videos like girl let me get my hand out from my blanket first
3:29 internet help me. What sound is that?? I cant put my finger on it, but i know it from somewhere.
Im 3 seconds in. Nice mountain shirt!!
george receiver
One of the cringiest things I have seen this year so far haha
Jojo didn’t even write the song she is just singing a cover
She should have done a genre switch and started making black metal. That would have done it.
Jojo changed A LOTTT LIKE A LOT and I think that when i was like a younger I bought A jojo Lipstick or chap stick and I think I still have it-
CHADCHAD BEING A HARVEY LOVER. WE HAVE WON!!!
This is extremely fake and manufactured. They are trying to make a Miley moment because tbh nobody really cared about Jojo until this thing started and she is acting like a child that just cursed for the first time
Not the eminem references
I do not know who this JoJo is and I aggressively do not care. Yet somehow the video was still funny! Truly Chad Chad is an unending font of talent, as well as apparently being the Avatar now!  😊
OH MY GOD WAIT PLEASE!!! I've been playing Stardew nonstop since the new update! Very pleased to find a fellow Harvey lover (he's such a sweet lil bean)
This video was too not boring to fall asleep to
Meth
Its not even her song. Shes ridiculous!!! All the child stars have eventual meltdowns annd this is hers! 🤷🏼‍♀️
That “Jojo can’t come to the phone right now. Why?” Bit HAD to be taken straight from Taylor Swift right? I don’t even like her music at all, but I remember when she had that edgy switch (I don’t know if that was something she stuck with for a while or what, but it happened 🤷‍♀️), she had that, “Sorry, the old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Cause she’s dead.” Thing in the song. Tell me I’m not the only one who finds this uncannily too similar to just be coincidence
but I didn't get the "thank you for watching my video out of allllllll the videos" :(
5:33 tf2 music spotted
Jojo is gay now
Hello hello I remember the old days pink rainbow bows
Please help. I went and watched the music video cause I was curious and it was so bad I regret everything
Bro not harveyy on sdv 😭 hes so weird
pls make longer vids
Where's the hand close up + thanks for watching? The deal is you feed us cringe then heal us with a hand wave to close out. WHERE IS MY HEALING?! WHERE IS MY CLOSURE?!
The fact that she said she made a new genre of music called gay pop baffles me. Girl you know David Bowie?? Freddie Mercury?? Girl in red??? Gay artists that were iconic she’s not doing anything new there. It’s a pretty normal thing now. She’s just a Disney kid going threw her “I wanna be grown up and be different  phase”
It just doesn't feel right without the part of the outro where the microphone gets thumped.
what happened to sitting chadchad
chad chad dancing in front of the music video like it’s just dance was so good
7:07 I said stop -Chad Chad 2024
She sounds like she’s been smoking for 40 years 😭
This happened because Jojo truly believes that if you LOOK the part, you ARE the part! People don't need to actually transition from one gender to the other, they can just wear the right clothes and boom they ARE the part because they look the part... She's only known life thru the lens of a camera pretending to be someone else aka acting where you dress in costume tho LOOK the part...
Chad chad u keep getting prettier and prettier (drop you routine or the alien cake poster WILL BE TAKEN🤬)
🌸💖💝💄🎀➡️🖤💔👿💢🏴‍☠️
Nice phone game commercial not cringey at all lol
bay 🤗
Not Avatar Chad Chad!! 😂💀
tbf it's working for her.  I've never heard of this person before in my life, yet she's all over YouTube videos last few days.
@12:24 LMAO the “nooooh 😡👺🤬” matched perfectly with the dog’s yawn 😭😭😂
You dont get it it's the most EXTREME MAKEROVER EVER GUYS!!!! She went from generic popstar wearing colourful clothes to generic popstar cosplaying as Gene Simmons
"no-one has made this dramatic of a change yet. no-one has made, in my generation, this extreme of a switch." lil tay: hold my abusive father  (and also obvs everyone chad chad mentioned in the video as well.) edit: spelling
More colage of ur cat please
In the beginning of the video when you said it dropped, I went looking for the song and came across the karma song. it was so tame I started wondering maybe there is another music video and I am looking at the wrong one. Honestly I was expecting something closer to Ramstein's P song ... if you know you know! the Choreography would have been interesting if it was not ruined by shaky cam! I don't get all the fuss.
OMGGG PLEASE COLLAB WITH GABI BELLE IT WOULD BE THE BEST COLLAB EVER
I'll tell you, We're talking about not being able to survive one second after taking a glimpse inside out heads? I'd win, you will be crushed to a paste after you look inside my mind.
5:21 ARCHIMEDES SOUNDTRACK SPOTTED IN THE WILD
Kids don’t stay kids for long… -wise man
hearing the undertale music in the background was insane
her costume looks like one of the Raiders on those Monsters of the Gridiron trading cards they had in the 90s
chadchadjojodance24hrs.wmv.jpg.exe
It's giving what a 12 year old thinks is edgy but still really likes Claire's.
Not "you were an accident "🤣🤣
Jojo siwa sounds exactly how I sounded after 2 months on testosterone gel (im a trans man)
Jojo's rebrand is the influencer version of Mars making the m&ms less sexy to distract from the child labor and abuse. It's fucking working on ya'll and it makes me sick
I dont know why, but Jojo looks like an angler fish in that outfit
I appreciate the fact that you put the jojos in reverse part order (poor jonathan)
Is anybody surprised, I mean sincerely surprised?
the person who wrote karma has also written songs for disney channel. hard to think of jojo as mature when her first "mature" song is written by a person who wrote songs to hsm2, descendants, shake it off...
did jojo ever walk back her randomly admitting to being a republican?
I just need a collab with Gunnar about this. You both have "I was in a frat and I think im well adjusted" energy and I love it.
Karma gives off glmv vibes. 😓
Gosh darn geewiz fiddlesticks it’s chad chad’s new video
This poor kid, childhood just isn't meant to be like that. How do you become normal after that.
A sh!t load of twinge!!!
What you don't seem to recognize: the amount of disrespect you show, doing a, what you called ''dance that doesn't require 12 hours of practice'' is EQUAL to Siwa copying the style of Gene Simmons and not knowing who he is.
what's sad though is people villainizing queer people using her as an example. homophobia isn't her fault obviously but people taking advantage of the situation and her immaturity not allowing her to consider anything but herself is...yeah
Jojo's clearly been possessed by Vaatu, thank goodness we have Avatar Chad to save the day 9:46
so the message is she's "bad" now because she's hooking up with women?
This is completely unrelated but liking Harvery from Stardew Valley is completely valid, I've been obsessed with him for years now >:D
twitter users 1 second after turning 18:
"Mom's spaghetti" I died
HARVEY FROM STARDEW VALLEY FAN SPOTTED 🫵🫵🫵 LETS GOOO
Harvey from Stardew, you have good taste ☺
I thought the new branding was cool in the sense that the glamrock aesthetic is a logical continuation of her rhinestone rainbow aesthetic, still flashy and sparkly but with an edge fitting for a teen (even though the makeup is atrocious imho girl get a better stylist), and that people were once again shitting on an lgbt girl in the limelight just because. The hype is certainly a little cringy and comes across as rehearsed bc this is pretty tame in the field of edgy rebranding. Like you can see the grasping for attention and money behind the veil, which is just normal in the entertainment industry, but usually people hide it better.  The stuff about workplace abuse and her defending that Colleen lady makes it all more iffy... But if she's a literal child pageant and then a child star I can't say I believe she could turn out fine growing in that environment.
actually thought the song was out with how much ive fucking heard it even tho i blocked j*jo s*wa because it was annoying not interacting with any content but still hearing and seeing this rebrand everywhere
Chad chad doing the jojo dance is not something I expected to see but I love it, and it's somehow better than the jojo dance.....
The choreography is so bad, the outfit just looks like a shitty ice skater look. The fucking black stripe looks like a serj tankian style goatee
2:30 I mean.   She's supposed to be really hard-core and angry but she's got that big arse grin on her face and is as happy and clean cut as ever.
What weirds me out is that she tries to change her style but retains those childlike mannerisms and attitude. It's like watching a 12-year old doing what she THINKS mature people do
2:18 "may contain strong language" meanwhile jojo: i wouldve never effed around
Just imagine.... 😂 "I'll proof everyone that I'm all grown up and edgy now! I'll go to a sex-store and buy a plushie" 🤣
JoJo part 9 sure took a weird turn.
Hi
Jojo would definitely think shes tweaking after taking a zyn pouch
Chad premiering Yo-Yo Pop Dance Group.
12:39 this sounds better than the real song
HARVEY😰😰😰😰😰ARE YOU KIDDING ME
THE HARVEY COMMENT I LOVE YOU
12:44 'sum chamgo love dive' vibes or that one lsfm stage where they do this
guys i think she might be a twisted cycle path.......
She’s just trolling for attention and money. She wants u to talk about it 🤷
I only know the anime
The video kinda made me think she (or her mom) tries to copy Lil Nas X.
Not Jojo saying she's the first gay pop artist then listing off artists with the biggest lbgtq following in the modern industry.
I didn't know Harvey had someone else in Stardew Valley... but i guess I'm okay with it 😅
I had a strange realization the other day that Jojo Siwa is a year and a bit OLDER than me... I made fun of her when I was 13 because I thought she was cringe, now knowing that she was older than me. 💀 I thought she was like 16 not 21. Goes to show you how being a child star and being forced to continue acting in a very cringe childlike way even after you grow up alters how everyone else sees you. I was convinced Jojo Siwa was several years younger than she is.
6:20 why is she wearing candy corn😂😂😂😂
Get a new PR team girl! The worst part about this is that it had potential to be good - something just a tad more mature and a subtle rebrand would have been great. I'm thinking Taylor swift 2006-2008 country/grunge pop... but oh welllllllll
The "tranquil sounds of motherhood" line took me out as a mum of 2 💀😂
regardless of how much hate this is getting, jojo will be earning a lot through this cuz of all the clout but the problem lies in the fact the next time she puts out a song no one will give a fuck about it
the water, air, fire and earth bending killed me
Ma'am...you can... *STRESS CLEAN* That's not a problem...it's a super power.
Why is it so funny to me that you ended it without reviewing the music video just “it had music and video “ 😭🤡
Y'all talking about how the boomerang didn't come back, but it did, that shit hit her in the head with how brain damaged this stuff is 😭
Chad Chad danced so hard she turned into the Avatar, master of all four elements
im gonna go call my mother and tell her how much i appreciate her after this
Wasnt expecting to see any of the joestars in this video 😭
I was expecting a video from you, either about Jojo or Jlo😂😂😂
"a new genre called gay pop" sorry, Chappell Roan is on the phone rn
i heard the word harvey and unsubscribed.
holy shit another harvey enjoyer 😱😱😱
She has the vocie of a 50 year old smoker lok
Who… even is this person. And why is she not in a mental institution
It’s not even her song, the original is way better
I think if you told AI to create the love child of Jodie Foster and Gene Simmons make them extraordinarily unlikable. It would create JoJo Siwa.
This girl need psychological help. Here parents failed!
Chad chad being the avatar is something i didnt expect 😅
So glad to see you on feed
With how fake everything is about her, im actually wondering if shes even really a lesbian or if that too is a tactic to gain attention. Im not saying that to be homophobic, im gay myself, it just seems like she wouldnt be beyond doing that.
i love standing chad chad
Chadbender 🥵
This gives me Miley Cyrus vibes tbh. The dramatic transformation after getting to completely separating yourself from a very forced childhood image/identity.  Hopefully Jojo will also mellow out eventually once media dies down and she find who she wants to be, and not who her managers want her to be.
Every child star needs to go through this I guess. I wish they could just do what they wanted without people piling on
I  had epileptic seizures with more grace  T.T  but ur right jojo brit's song IS all i had on my mind in the past 3 days - thank u for resurfacing her amazing talent XD
it sucks because i actually enjoyed the song it just  does not feel right coming from her
you didn't mention how the song wasn't hers, but another artists! such a funny touch to this story
The costume looks like if Gene Simmons had a baby with Old Gregg
9:30 yesss queen! Jojo actually did the wrong version this is the real version on the right.🎉🎉
I'm not super familiar with Jojo's body of work so far, but I can say this still feels incredibly homeschooled.
The karma acapella cover was sp iconic
All she had to do was google Gene Simmons 🫠
She did not bounce back like a boomerang 💀💀💀
"Jojo hunny wake up its time for your Miley Cyrus bad girl turn"- Jojo's Mom
As a homosexual we do not claim her as a gay pop writer- only lady Gaga deserves that title
Jojo 18+ 💀
Never heard of her, was expecting some tiktoker gone viral through JoJo Bizzare adventure memes
10:28 RAAAAAH JOJOS BIZZARE ADVENTURE MENTIONED, WHAT IS A HAPPY ENDING
I guess 10 years of that tight ponytail pulling her head really did something to her brain huh
WWE ass
9:13 please the fact that i decided to watch this video before the deep dive into Harvey is so funny to me wtf
Long time fan, but I have to ask - did you lift this from Frogbait or did they lift it from you?
❤
She’s so cringe, ugh
I WAS HOLDING MY BRRATH WAITNG FOR THIS VIDEO BY YOU YESSSSYESUEHSGEYSHHEYES
Girl you look stunning in this black top ❤
the outro... its not there
I feel like we can criticize the siwas without making fun of jojos appearance you know?
Chad Chad should be an idol with those dance moves 🫶🤭🤭
yall i think the boomerang came back a little too hard
nah cause it physically hurts when i see jojo siwa promoting her song continuously like it will "change the world" like "nobody's ever seen soemthing like this" and thinking she ate when she literally stole half of it and put 2 beats over it like....
She fell off that yacht only to wash up on Epstein's island . . .
Her mom being behind this makes the emphasis on "lesbianism is scandalous" in the video make so much sense
9:10 REALL
Honestly on literally anyone else in any other context the costume could be pretty cool, which is devastating to me
your Avatar live action interpretation was so much better than the Netflix one 😌
isnt gay pop already a thing also would this song even be considered gay pop
the phase she is going through at 20 is the phase most girls go though at 12
Glam-black-metal
And it's not even her song
That BMW  "rapping" 😂  She gives me vibes that she is being controlled and I expect a tell all book years down the road about her being  " glad her mother died".  We have seen this time and time again. ☹️
🔥
When the hell is mother's day in America?
I LOVE THE SHIRT
JoJo Siwa trying to summon KISS back and KISS going to actually would have their 125th reunion tour of JoJo is successful
Jojo and her mom are so cringe. But I’ve never laughed more. 😂
9:46 Was WAYYY too spot on... why is jojo summoning the four elements in her dance hmmm 🤨Very suspicious
Almost all child stars go through this phase. I'm glad it's just cringy and not drugs or alcohol abuse.
Ew Harvey no
It’s like watching a seven year old playing dress up trying to imitate what they think an edgy adult pop star would look like.
I was only vaguely aware of Jojo Siwa before this and all this did was prove to me I was correct to not really know or care about anything she does.  Thank you Chad Chad.
She gives me such Jake Paul vibes
I've been traumatized by Jojo's music video.
There can only be one double named icon and thats ChadChad
The dog sitting in the cage with the door wide open watching you dance was absolutely killing me
I was just playing Stardew Valley and wondering who in the world romances Harvey. I always forget he's even an option. 💀  (To be fair, he looks just like my uncle who is also a doctor, so my brain might be auto-dismissing him.)
“iTs nOt a PhAsE mOM”
Take it easy on Jojo, she’s rebranding asbestos she can
Chad chad down!
Humiliation ritual
Is this like her 2007 Britney era???
chad being a harvey gal is the last thing i wanted to hear
Chad chad is rocking the boomer T-shirt today
I just looked up how old Jojo Siwa is and she's 20!? Since when??? I thought she was going to be like 16 at most right now but no, she's a full ass adult and she still sort of looking & sounding like a 12-year-old. It's not helping that she dressed like bedazzled KISS.  p.s. I appreciate that you mastered all four elements for this video. keep up the good work Avatar.
wasn't expecting jojo dry humping a girl in my lifetime, but there's a first for everything (music video)
your whole karma mv reaction has me cry laughing
Your transition from topic to topic is immaculately disproportionate to the content matter
No idea who this is but when I saw the rebrand I was like oh so WWE??
That song is 100% AI generated
chad chad i love you but i do think it’s imperative to mention that jojo is friends with and promotes people who have been predatory to people and most importantly children as she is rebranding away from that content
Harvey? Really?
Is it me or is Jojo doing something weird with her voice
JoJo's rebrand looks like if Kiss and Bratz did a collab and it somehow WASN'T good
“i’m gonna invent gay pop” lady gaga, sophie, kevin abstract, and like 100 other artists would like a word
She feels like a female version of a Paul brother
She wants to be bad in a cool way but instead was just bad in the cringe, exploitative, predator defender, cycle of abuse perpetuator way
This is not an attempt at rebranding, she's trying to be a cringelord on purpose in order to generate this "silly-goofy" press, and distract from the allegations regarding her very own children's dance show. 😭
“I am the force of a generation” she thinks she’s Kanye
I also hate how she’s pretending she wrote the song, it’s actually an unreleased song by Brit Smith from 2012. She just bought it
WOW! Hype Train Derailed.🤣🤣
Karen super sayang
As a semi loyal Chad Chad fan, you are not welcome for watching (cuz you didn't say thank you in this video :( ) But for real, its giving kid who snorts pixie stix and says they're doing drugs energy.
KISSING AND SMOOCHING HARVEY IS SO REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
livin that raider lifestyle
Bro i swear i opened reels and i got a jojo siwa emo reel and i open youtube and i see this vid and i immediately click on it
inventing 'gay pop' and proceeding to see the word lesbian as gross is somethin new alright 💀💀💀
I like the old jojo siwa
She came in like a wrecking ball
Nobody gonna notice the disappearance of " Ty for clicking on my video out of all the videos" First it was Fortnite now it is JOJO
i have the same shirt you're wearing  edit: i checked and mine is cooler
She reminds me of the “crazy rebels” on like Disney, or Nickelodeon 😂
I miss the og ''A twinge of cringe" voice
Yk jojo had spent her entire life living this "Pink girly aesthetic" Lifestyle, and she hasn't gone through her emo phase, sooooo... 💀💀💀 She is fiiiiiinally expressing herself... I guess...? (lol I ain't on jojo's side 💀)
CHAD CHAD
Bro she looks like a kid Who got mad at their mom for not cooking chicken nuggets And Found out what kiss is
9:37 bending the 4 elements to this dance is ACTUALLY sending me😭
i'm chad chads patella, (not really)
The song Karma was meant for someone else Brit Smith she recorded a video but never saw the light of day until now. And let me tell you Brit Smith is way better than JoJo
Maaan I was gonna say you lost me at Harvey but the bachelors are all kinda lame/toxic so I guess he’s ok to go for
Girl you had me rolling on the floor when you were busting out the moves 😂😂😂😂
My favorite part of this whole thing is how dumbass evangelicals and Americans conservatives are reacting to this like it's actually something that matters or affects them at all. They're losing their minds and are so triggered it's got them melting like snowflakes! 💀
Fuckin MegaMind (the old one) was more edgy than this bullshit
Idk some ppl said this is all being done on purpose. But my personal theory is jojo is emotionally stunted  and she needs therapy.
The deaf are lucky to not have to hear her.
This is like a 10-year-old's idea of edgy. I mean I can't fully blame her because she's a product of her mom's influence, from dance moms and beyond... But it's still incredibly cringe. It's like she's just going through the motions of the bad girl arc just because she (or her mom) thinks she's supposed to do that at this point in her career, to advance it. But I can still blame her for the abuse of those going girls, yikes, no matter if her mom brainwashed her she's fully an adult and responsible for perpetuating the abuse she grew up with
She's doing this for attention. She used to get all kinds of it but now that she's older nobody cares.
chad chad got competition with jo..  jo ?
So you don't think it's the bleeding kids mother that is primarily responsible for her daughter dancing after receiving a recent procedure?
I HAVE NEVER WANTED TO WATCH A VIDEO MORE AFTER READING A TITLE 😫😫😫
Gold dust is a wrestler.
And they say after this life altering injury, Chad Chad never danced again 😢 10:02
What about the kids 😂
Omg you were an accident had me rolling
11:27 My grandma thats actually 69 this year has that doll of the cock, and i know she doesn't even know what that thing is and that shit is on tokopedia
The second i heard joe,i felt the yo mama joke and it was still so funny
13:31 shoutout for keeping the bird👏🏼
her ponytail was so tight it gave her brain damage
sexy glam gene simmons sea creature 💀
Also, inspired use of the minecraft skeleton noise. A+
she lowkey dressed like a stand user
I also want to kiss and smooch Harvey from stardew valley all the time!
This absolutely sent me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shes finally out of it
I feel bad for her scalp every time I see her.
The cringe is damn near unbearable with this one.
I want to say just let young people be weird and kinda embarassing, but the middle-aged manager/helicopter mum fingerprints are so visible...
you're telling me karma came out on april 5th?   JOJO WHAT DID MY BIRTHDAY DO TO DESERVE THAT PUNISHMENT!?
Who knew hyping up your rebrand would bring forward old workplace abuse allegiations from something I didn't know was a thing she had under her already...
Jojo: omg ima give the gays something new to enjoy, gay pop! There has never been gay pop! Lil Nas X: still sliding down his stripper pole to hell 💀 Tegan and Sara: grab bats (because softball, lesbians)
All she knows is caricature
why'd you change the into... you sound so soulless..... </3 (idk how to tag this, im not actually upset)
12:23 the doggo yawning 😭❤️‍🩹
I was a jojo kid. I forgot about jojo until today
Her outfit looks like megaminds 😳😳 I can’t unsee it 😭😭
Mothers would love raycons. I have an autistic 3 yr old who loves to screech. Been using raycons three years. Have washed them several times. Still work like new.
The sad thing is that the song has been stuck in my head since i watched the video 😂
The Harvey mention is so real
Heeeeeeeeeeeey it’s you
“I wanna make a new genre; it’s called gay pop” MAM THATS LITERALLY JUST HYPERPOP😭😭
“You have to edge us” -chad chad 2024
youre such agood dancer❤
Jojo needs to stop using her invisible boomerang on intimate objects.
Sooner or later you have to grow with your audience, I have no idea why people still choose to waste time on the Paul brothers. People are just not focused enough.
I feel like if she really wanted a big rebrand then the first thing to go should've been the glitter
She is so weird to my brain She's 20, she looks 12, she acts 16 and somehow she sounds like a 60 year old chainsmoker What is happening
The only thing Edgy here is how we didn't get the og Chad Chad ending to this video!! thank you for posting this video out of ALLLLL the other videos on here! see you in the next comment section!! <3
Chad Chad's version of karma sounds better
I used to like JoJo's songs as a little girl with me friend but- I'm not liking it no more...
You're the only youtuber that makes me laugh from my gut, truly I gotta pause the vid to laugh at the jokes/edits sometime
she seems so manic, it's giving gabbie hanna vibes.. i feel like she is overcompensating and trying to act like she doesnt care what people think, when she definitely does.. she needs to step away from hollywood for a sec haha
wears kiss like outfit  jumps around like a mascot and waves and smiles at the cameras at red carpets and dances around like mickey mouse* people don’t like what is new and unknown
😈😈😈
This rebrand is indeed a heaping pile of cringe.
It’s so sad bc for a second there she was a genuinely wholesome gay advocate
“I was a bad girl” SHE WAS LITERALLY COVERED IN UNICORN VOMIT FOR DECADES
you didn't do your normal outro :(
The real betrayal of this video is finding out that your go to stardew valley bachelor/ette is harvey. For shame
Why is she making out with herself lol
I am listening to this video on my ray con everyday earbud (not sponsored by the way). I’ve been wearing this earbud for about 8 hours now. The other day it fell out of my ear and into the bathtub while I was giving my dog a bath. And I can honestly say this is the shittiest audio quality I’ve ever heard. #notsponsered
Omg the dog screaming about killed me 😅
Oh she did not just call herself psycho as if that's a goofy thing to be and not a serious diagnosis. What the fuck
Chadchad, (can I call you Chad? I’ll call you Chad) you don’t have to say a twinge of cringe anymore. It’s okay. You can just start the video and say “not really” like we can tell you’re getting tired of it don’t worry it’s not integral to the viewing experience
Love her or hate her, her song is forever in y'alls head so  technically her marketing is annoying but she doin it right 😂😂😂
Awh man, you missed the part where her new song and this song are completely plagiarized
9:13 OH MY GOD REAL
wait but how do you get the hot balloon cutscene with harvey
BABE WAKE UP CHAD CHAD POSTED
The way you ended this😂
why does she sound like muscle man’s girlfriend?
Says she wants to create gay pop… but gay pop has existed for decades. George Michael, Elton John, Lady Gaga, Pet Shop Boys….and so many more.
SHEESH
9:51 "WOW SHE'S RRREEALLLY GOOD!!"
She has the same ~evil energy from Buzz Lighyear's enemy, emperor Zurg.
I am totally scandalized…    Harvey?  Really?  I mean, I think he’s okay, but 12 hours?
I actually had no.idea who she was until this video. From what I can tell, it looks like she is really really trying to market this "new thing", thinking thats all she needed to do. The thing is, Jojojojo.. you need to deliver. You can't be like oh this hasnt been done before, but it has. Oh like a new genre, but its not. its so edgy... and it isnt.  I wanna hear and dance to track by Chad Chad, coz I think she can deliver the goods. It would be outta this world.😁
As a lesbian I think we should leave the humping to the heteros…  Ps. I liked ur copyright free version better 🥰🌸
Omg the Harvey line at 9:12 made me laugh so hard cuz you’re so right
I miss the regular ending
Jojo Siwa thinks she's the first gay person to be in music somehow.
Chad you're so fucking funny
"what's been in your head the last three days?"  The song Karma. By Brit Smith. Cause the original is a bop and I can't believe this isn't the first thing people are talking about! IT'S NOT JOJO'S SONG  Covers are fine, I love a good cover but you've got to call it what it is.
I have never been more disappointed in someone- the fact you want to smooch on Harvey??? Sebastian, Elliot and Shayne are the way to go 😂
JoJo's makeup in the gene simmons clip literally gives Ronin from marvel 💀💀😭
Damn everyone out here kissing Harvey, I can’t have a unique experience and hoard him to myself. I’m going to say a swear. (F)
this being chad chad's 69th video is... definitely something 😃
Everytime I see a new Chad Chad vid I’m reminded how much I miss Her 😢 gimme more please. Please Sir may I have another new content weekly. Thank you Sir. Miss you. Love you. ❤😂
"No one has made this dramatic of a change"  If you were a cartoon character you'd be Patrick because living under a rock is the only explanation for this kind of lunacy.
She was like "this is going to be so edgy that u wouldn't even be able to handle it", but like... girl, we survived Miley Cyrus lightskin era, wake up. U're not edgy, u're just cringe.
"You have to edge us" BYE-
i strongly believe that jojo siwa has been turned into a cash cow by the adults around her. it's also a shame and ironic that her version of "punk" or "rock" is just a monochromatic version of herself, and was manufactured by the controlling adults around her. honestly, TV and media networks just have a terrible history of neglecting and/or being indifferent to the perspective of young people and only care about their potential, and not what was sacrificed in trying to reach said potential.
Ohhh I love Harvey too 🥺💖
5:46 peak
See me
THE QUEEN HAS POSTED 🙏🙏
she was talking about the video like it was gonna be like the yonkers video😭
is no one gonna talk about how jojos mom doesn't smile she just grimaces
Being gay and overly sexual in 2024  isn't the "breaking the glass ceiling" she thinks it is, its kind of just the norm
I kinda feel bad for her. She’s been locked into acting like a child for years. Probably so much of her life was focused on her brand and business and pleasing her family on top of it. I don’t even know if she would of had time to look up all of the sick shit about Shame Dawson. If she just trusts her team and they’re not doing their due diligence. Nobody knows what she’s really like for us to know. I never watched him but when everything came out it seemed like fans didn’t know. She could just be given a schedule “your filming with this person today, you’ll be doing this, then going on this podcast and we want you to hype up your music and does she even know how to not act like the hyper persona she’s played most of her life. It seems like she doesn’t even know huge cultural things or people. Like she’s been kept in a box not able to mature like the rest of us. I just know other famous people who’ve had similar experiences and they break free of their or, management, parents and just cringe at their past. She’s probably so excited to able to be an adult but people around her are also controlling her move into adulthood. They’re still putting her into another box. It’s just my gut feeling imagining being in her position. People cringed at Miley too. And Miley was desperate to escape her image just like JoJo. But Miley had a great voice. She was able to recover. JoJo won’t but she won’t have to worry about money.
More proof that exposing kids to fame at a young age is a terrible idea for their mental health when they are adults.
This isn’t JoJo Siwa, this is JoJo Seeya
The boomerang came back and hit her so hard She had a stroke 💀✨️
I was hoping you’d cover this! 😂🎉
your dance break was the cherry on top
its honestly giving main character syndrom 💀
I was laughing so hard 🤣
Gay pop 💀
I thought she was cosplaying Mudvayne lead singer in Dig mv 😭
Would reccomend the brit smith version of the song it actually kinda slaps
bro turned into a gay powers ranger villain
2:59 Gay-pop so we have pop,kpop,jpop,cpop,chpop,tpop now gay-pop .....🤦
The newest avatar has risen!!
Nice shirt !!!
Love you chadchad
I can definitely tell that the choreography is Richie’s, lady Gaga’s choreographer. Only Gaga is like 17 years older than Jojo and can dance a lot better to Richie’s choreography.
It’s like a kid loudly proclaiming they’re going to do something cool and then falling on their face
Therapist: Chad Chad doing the karma dance isnt real it cant hurt you Chad Chad doing the karma dance:
I thought she doing a collab with Slipknot with her make ups 😭
im gonna cry how is chadchads dance better than jojos😭
She really went from a neon glow stick to a emo siren
You should make a cover album,  like Annie Lennox's Medusa
I can't tell if she took inspiration from sting from wwe or kiss.
I was drinking tea and I laughed and now my phone is not working so I’m on my computer now, whoops(the tea tipped over 😢)
Mothers day is coming up????? Oh D:
Her saying “messed around” like the original song instead of “effed around” really got me
11:00 tbh jessalyn doesnt deserve to be called by her real name
You changed your twinge of cringe why
There is a Todd in the Shadows video about that time MC Hammer tried to rebrand into a "gangsta" and this has the same energy, including the aggressive choreography
yeah JoJo's definitely a narcissist
THANK GOD SOMEONE (ESPECIALLY YOU) IS TALKIGN ABOUT THIS  HELP LMAOOO
Chad’s Chad is getting old she can’t sit down
Why does rebranding as an “adult” have to always include , sex, alcohol ,partying and more sex, is there nothing better to do? Like I’m so tired of it 😭
8:20  The picture of Jojo and her mom there is the most frightening and intimidating thing that Jojo will ever release... 😳🙀🙈
🎉
Chad chads version is actually so much better 😂
who even is gene simmions? that guy who wears makeup and kisses men?
JoJo Siwa is the embodiment of a seventh grader
chad chad, i completely forgot who you were until i was reminded of this video. I don't really need to watch the whole thing to know if it's a bad video or not cuz you always make good videos tbh, also, im so sorry, im sorry you have to go through this pain, maybe we'll pay for your therapy, who knows!
Apparently she was bleeding from her belly button not just her stomach
Why do I like the karma in their video more than the normal one?
What ever happened to Jojo siwas dog??
I don’t see many people talking about this, but apparently JoJo’s song is a cover song so she’s basically getting everybody hyped over a song that’s not even hers
someone needs to tell jojo she isn’t the first lesbian lmfao the entire thing about inventing “gay pop” when there is an entire culture surrounding queer music already like girl hayley kiyoko is RIGHT THERE
"i did some bad things" like what, lacing your makeup line with asbestos ??? id say thats a bit worse than bad ?? or is it the defending predators thing ?? or is it the selling rainbow bows ??????????????
You and me are mortal but rock n roll will never die!
I hope jojo continues doing this stuff. She’s terrible at everything and I will happily watch all of it hahaha
the good ship lollipop 🍭 lost a passenger
9:11 YEAAAAH HARVEY STANS UNITE
So doing lesbo ghey stuff for money and 'edge'? Sounds like everyone with a following nowadays honestly 🙄 How original
You’re so funny it’s rude bc after this I’ll watch something else and it will suck 🤧
the elements bending editing was gold lmao
When I tell you I was WAITING for you to make a video about this- 😭❤️
That music video was so cringe. 😑😑😶‍🌫😶‍🌫  Also she is clearly trying to hard to say "look at me I'm an adult now!" 🙃🙃  That and attention seeking this hard is so lame, she should have just accepted that she has faded into obscurity, that and I have always HATED those stupid bows - really never understood why anyone would want to go out of their way to look stupid tbh.
i wish she would just go defeat dio or smth smh
Yes finally chad chad is covering this
Fr tho why is she humping woman with her “boomerang”?? 😭
Jojo is just a little quirky…
You dancing made me audibly laugh and it’s been a hard day so thank u chad chad (not rlly)
it hurts seeing her compare this to cant be tamed. cant be tamed had an amazing concept, yes it was still a more "disney-friendly" release compared to Bangerz, but it captured the sexy rebellion concept in a unique and dark way. the sets, costuming, and atmosphere actually tied into the song, which is something JoJo is missing. there's no artistic quality to this music video, probably because it was originally Brit's. if you watch Brit's unreleased music video, she actually had a concept that made sense with the song.   idk. this is nowhere near as mature of a concept as can't be tamed. if you took away the word "bitch" and the 5 seconds of humping, this could literally fit perfectly into her prior discography.
Will u come stress clean my house?
She actually copied the song 💀💀💀
I blame her mom but also I blame the Ballingers for new edgy JoJo. Don't come at me, but I fully blame them for whatever the hell this is.
I literally just keep seeing the Wish/TEMU version of Kiss
Yikes
YOURE A HARVEY SIMP??? WHAT HOW WAS I NEVER AWARE
12:04 "so let's go SIWA-t all the fuss is about??
The song is catchy because it was made for Miley Cyrus.
yeah, Jojo is acting pretty bizarre  idk shit about her i just wanted to make the bad joke
I didn't even know Jojo and her mom did all of that... they're trying to be their own personal ta ta and tiaras or whatever that shitty show was. Honestly, screw them lol
omg Harvey #1 the best I agree
Her outfit gives less bad girl and more circus performer
FELLOW HARVEY ENJOYERS UNITE!!!
The music video was horrible she reused the same clips like 5 times
7 hours ago
I wasnt ready to say I'm a bit of a stinker
Chad Chad talking about Jojo.  Full circle.
9:46 Chad Chad the Last Chad
kiss and smooch harvey is so real
sorry officer i think jojo escaped her straight jacket again
the way that its not ever her song she just sang a song not really applicable to her situation and aggressively humped a girl.
HARVEY IS SO REAL 😭
3:08 ok but I agree with her on that. Spicy straight doesn't equal actually gold star 🌈...Miley Cyrus never did a lesbian Magnum Opus like Karma is 😂😂😂  8:49 apparently KISS just sold their whole catalogue and brand too 😂😂😂 that's exactly where my mind went when I saw this outfit
4:12 this is not related to jojo at all but, I HAVE THE SAME BLANKET😶
Yeah I know your videos are supposed to show cringey stuff and all, but this crosses some lines. It was hard to watch
It's completely unrelated to the video, but you're so right about the Harvey bit🙏🙏🙏
been waitin for this one
8:54 HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO GENE SIMMONS IS & YOU'RE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY?? LOOL
HARVEY??? HARVEY>> OUT OF ALL THE CBACHELORS .. HARVEU??????/
NO NOT MY MAMA 😖
This whole thing actually makes me kinda sad because it's probably just a pr stunt that her mom or her management thought of that she might not have wanted tod o in the first place:(
I honestly love her new outfit? Am I weird? Like it doesn’t match jojo but it’s kinda great?
The more she tries to seem adult, the more childish she comes off. Like a kid who wandered into the back of Spencer's and can't stop giggling. I can't even laugh at her, this is just... sad.
the fact it isn't even her song 💀
Babe wake up, chad chad posted again
Gahhhd tiktok is such a catalyst for mental illness
She seems so sheltered from everything including the things she's trying to do, I kind of feel bad.
I like you. You are funny.
5:30 She be sniffing her own farts a bit too hard...
9:13 CHAD CHAD IM PLAYING STARDEW RN I LITERALLY MARRIED HARVEY 😭😭
Prince, Bowie and Mercury are rolling in their graves at "Gay Pop"
jojo’s choreography is something i would see on just dance 😭
Idk if it's just me but the way she's acting reminds me so much of Michael Scott. Especially at 11:19 and 11:22
love u chad chad u r so smart and witty
i think she was so traumatized from that music video that she forgot to even do her outro
I'm cringing so hard I'm in physical pain I can't do this no more
i’m a bit convinced this is all just a clever media ploy
"no one has made this big of a change" ma'am. dove cameron. i state my case.
7:55  GIRL I WAS AT A REHEARSAL WORKING 9-5 TO MAKE A LIVING AND ALL I DID WAS SLEEP JOJO SLEEP CAUSE IT WAS EXHAUSTING
why did I read this title as "JoJo Siwa's Edgy Bra"? I thought she had also released some sort of "fashion" line and then I watched the video and felt really dumb
"My god, it's the avatar" If only Netflix had casted Chad Chad (name pending)
CHAD CHAD FINALLY TALK ABOUT JOJO YAYYY I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS BRO
I feel like her mother (if shes really behind all of this) thought of the most "rebelious" thing she could've done as a teenager and the thing was listening to kiss LMAO
She dances like Pencata from the Kung Fu Panda Ripoff
Not really!!!
Chad Chad I'm sorry but I gotta judge you for this video. I mean come on, Harvey???
She's just copying other people, or am I crazy?
I’ve been waiting for this
my friend mentioned the fact that jojo just looks like she’s doing a really weird cosplay of a KISS member
when is the copyright free karma coming to spotify I wanna listen to the full song
When is the Chad Chad cover album dropping?
she wants to be Miley Cyrus so bad
The twinge of cringe intro has changed 😂😂 kinda love it
JoJo JoJo? What? No MoJo Jo Jo references?
hmmm i think the copyright free version is better than the original ngl.
Fyyy keep making vids!
Chad Chad is the new Avatar confirmed
The fact I have her blocked on all my social media, yet I can't escape the god damn song
Someone tried to pitch that very song to Miley in like 2012, and Jojo used a track from one of her exes, so she's spouting all this "first of my generation" crap, and didn't even write anything
jojo’s most bizarre adventure yet 💀
Bro wants to be Poppy but is not even Fizzy.
I hate to say it, but I do like this song😂😂😂
one of these vids I'm expecting Chad to say "A twa of cwa"
she's not real
didn’t even cover the fact that THIS ISNT HER SONG??
Love the fact that Chad Chad nailed it on the head that this was 100% her mom's idea of an "edgy" rebrand. The way they painted her a la parent volunteer at a fair was so dirty too
Chad ate with the choreo ngl
Shoutout all my aliencakeheads out there
world's most annoying lesbian
She didn’t have to drop her song on my birthday. Why did she do it on my birthday. 😔
She dresses like she's been lost in a Claire's warehouse for the last 15 years. Her new outfit isnt any different lol
Stardew valley mentioned :3
Honestly I know it's all cringe and we love to bitch about that, but I kinda feel for her. Shes treated as a child brand her whole life. Of course she wants to shove it in everyones face that she's an adult now. I would too!
Trying to be edgy and scary but she won’t say “fuck”.
copyright is a bitch but man does it make for some funny creativity
someone tell me why whenever i saw the photo of jojo leaving with the giant plushie that _i thought the plushie was in the bag i genuinely did not see the actual plushie until __11:48__ of this video and i've seen a couple videos with people talking about this photo_
What makes it worse is that JoJo Siwa actually stole “her” new song “Karma”
OF COURSE YOU ARE A HARVEY GIRLY IT SLL MAKES SENSE
the elements that came up when you were dancing sent me😭💀
I lost it 300% when the dog screamed.
She just looks like a kid dancer doing a routine to a Kiss song. Her heart isn’t in being a “bad girl”
I LOVE STARDEW VALLEY
I had never heard of this person before like this week; of course I am an Old. But she (like the vast majority of people) doesn't appear to have an unusual amount of talent for singing or dancing or acting or comedy or anything? Why is she on The Media? Why are people commenting about her on The Media? Why am I here asking questions about her?  Also her name is the same thing two times, LIKE CHADCHAD!
She truly thinks this is ground breaking  and I'm getting secondhand embarrassment.
She thought "can't be tamed" was edgy but ended up being more "party in the usa," but with black glitter. She's kind of like kids bop cascada. Just doing club versions of songs and changing nothing else 😂
It's not badass gear she has on. That's just another dance costume. Maybe she should take some time to figure out who she really is and then showcase that but the costume thing is giving desperation.
Jojos song would've done so great in 2018
I totally forgot JoJo came from the dance mom thing
NOT EVEN HER SONGGG... IT WAS MADE BY SOME ELSE.... ILL EDIT WHEN I FIND OUT WHO MADE IT!
Chadchad is your name inspired by JoJo
Todays sponsor is my favourite ChadChad character, I love when they said [BRAND TALKING POINT] (I love you ChadChad)
zachpeters7899 I hope your ashamed.
i was praying that chad chad would cover this 🥳🥳
Thank you for breaking your knee for us
Omg JJBA is my autistic special interest and I cannot put into words how happy the reference made me 😭💔💔
Jojo in her Jake Paul era
ngl I feel like the marketing is shaped to attract negative attention on purpose, cuz how else are you supposed to get the internet's attention besides participating in controversy?
This video is good.
YESSS IM SO HAPPY
Wait until Jojo figures out about black metal
New tv for tchad tchad
Thank god, that had music
Kiss cosplay? That's the "edgy new era"? Ok.  I'm DYING to have a Harvey romance gameplay when 1.6 comes to switch ❤ I've married Elliot and Leah so far! I wish we could romance Gus, love him too.
Bro was I the only person who thought 7:08 was a coryxkenshin video reference?
Jojo Siwa is what would happen if we allowed Lisa Frank to make people
Just odd 😂
Ads = sellout
Knowing that Chad Chad is a Harvey girlie surprised me more than Jojo Siwa's rebranding.
I totally get why you think her mom is behind it, but JoJo has also been homeschooled her entire life, even before getting famous, so I feel like this is a tally her vision of what’s edgy.
Girl you ATE with that avatar editing🎉🎉🎉
love the video but HARVEY???? HARVERY???? why????/lh  Edit: never mind i went through his storyline and i love this man, he’s literally one of the girls and i love him for that 👏
and the song is BAAAAADDDDD lmao.
im so stoked to know chad chad is a fellow harvey enjoyer
Chad Chad being a Harvey wife makes so much sense
9:47 all the elements in one dance-
Im telling my mommy about that music video.
Jojo looks like the fairys from onward 💀💀💀
9:13 STARDEW VALLEY MENTIONED🗣️🗣️🗣️AHHHH WHATS LIFE ANYMORE👹👹🗣️🗣️🗣️🎉
Omg Chad Chad is the avatar 😧
You know, your version of the music video was way more watchable than Jojo’s 😭
ChadChad, great video and all but, Is your leg ok? Please let us know as soon as possible.
As a fellow Harvey enjoyer I immediately liked and subbed
Idk how she got so fake and CRINGE
She's giving JLo from Dance Moms 😭
The Avatar bit was what finally killed me.
The hat in time music at 8:29🌝So, Whats the Plan by Pascal Michael Stiefel to be specific. 💀I'm such a nerd lol😭
She took "act your age" to another level💀
shes like miley cyrus at her crazy phase
7:39 why is she moving like that 😭
The Harvey appreciation made me subscribe
HARVEY IS SUCH A L HOW  CHAD CHAD I BELIEVED IN YOU
your dog basically hiding is the funniest thing about the music video playing 😭
and it’s not even her song 😭
I knew what I knew what I knew it I knew it I knew it motherfuker I'm sorry I'm sorry why are the ladies so obsessed with keeping their jokes different I understand half of the internet people out there don't want to hear the same joke more than once anymore but this is YouTube man the place where people start and continue to have running personal jokes because of the audience they have built why do we need to change it so quickly I mean Jack literally re-uploaded every single one of his Happy Wheels videos into one video Jedi suppose everyone just doesn't like Happy Wheels anymore no one wants to see that s*** yes this is a tangent about the intro and outros
jojo is almost making me want to scoot myself back into the closet 😭
Wtf is that
Tbh I can’t laugh at the cringe bc it seems so much like a product of her mom and pr team like Chad Chad said. Jojo’s been a celeb since she was a little kid, she’s been exploited her entire life. I find this rebrand extremely dystopian. Someone who is still being controlled in every way singing about how they’re out of control. Idk. It’s just sad.
Girl bring back the intro and outro wtf
"Bad girl" means dressing like a glam rocker/luchadora and doing a highly coreographed dance with a bunch of other people dressed exactly like you rite
Chad Chad- as far as I'm concerned lady, you've achieved male levels of comedy. 👏🏻😊  Edit:  Thank you guys for 17,000 likes!  I knew it was an EXTREMELY funny joke, but I didn't expect THIS reaction!  You guys are great.🌞
Yes I clicked on this video out of allllll the other videos 😂 love you Chad Chad
Nobody can accidentally be this cringe… right?
Am sorry but i liked the old cringey jojo better😭
The Harvey thing? Same 😂😂😂😂😂
She looks like a Power Rangers villain who was shot out of a black ooze and glitter cannon
TF2 BACKGROUND MUSIC HOLY SHITTTTT
You're cover of the song was better than the original.  PLS MAKE MORE COVERS, YOUR VOICE IN AMAZING
IM SO HAPPY
2:59 nah nah nah nah people be taking this whole LGBTQ thing wayyy to seriously like wow cool you like girls boys whateva BUT YOU DONT NEED TO SHOVE IT IN PEOPLES FACE LIKE…you support it cool you don’t cool wow THIS WAS NEVER A THING A FEW YEARS AGO SO WHY NOW???
Girl pulled a Miley Cyrus
1. People can change aesthetics if they want to. 2. Why does it matter to you so much if she doesn't want to be targetted to children anymore?  3. She can make her decisions, she's literally a adult.   I don't want this to be taken as hate, this topic about Jojo changing is just annoying.
10:24  Call me crazy but is that a reference to a series of Japanese origin created in 1987 by a man named Hirohiko Araki that follows the adventures of the descendants of the family known as Joestar in which the main character is known as Jojo and must use supernatural powers to defeat the villains of their respective parts with the first of said powers being the energy of the sun known as 'The ripple' or 'Hamon' that was used for the first two parts until part three 'Stardust Crusaders' where instead of Hamon the protagonists must use psychic embodiments of their fighting spirit called 'Stands' because they stand beside you where the part three stands are named for Tarot cards and Egyptian gods but by part four 'Diamond is Unbreakable' they have have a tendency to be named after songs as shown Josuke Higishikata's (Jojo) stand which is called Crazy Diamond in reference to the Pink Floyd song 'Shine on you crazy diamond' but eventually in part six 'Stone Ocean' the universe is reset and we enter the universe called the 'Steel Ball run' Universe by fans because it is the universe where parts seven and eight 'Steel ball run' and 'Jojolion' take place and is also the introduction of the 'Spin' which is thought to be that universe's counterpart to Hamon?
okay i like the wild outfit stuff - we all need some weird art release after being abused by high-expectation parents. She is having fun and exploring, doesnt need to be perfect or 'cool' - edit: if chadchad's theory is right that Jojo's mom is still involved. She needs to get Out and learn healthy work life balance
Thought this was KallMeKris for a minute
Its her emo phase
Not Harvey from Stardew
Chad Chad is out here being the avatar. Chad Chad ain't doing half bad bad
HARVEY MENTION 🎉🎉🎉
Absolutely not related to the video in the slightest but did anyone else notice the In Space with Markiplier poster on the floor leaning on the wall? I deadass went "ooo ooo 👆👆👆" lmfao
Covid really got to her in lockdown….
5:12 I was not expecting tf2 music that was a jumpscare
I remember when jojo was making those cringey videos of herself when she was younger, now this? Weird..
JoJo’s JoJo JoJo JoJo JoJo JoJos Mojo Dojo
I think JoJo is like, having a crisis thing 🥰
Sher new look reminds me of KISS.
YAYAYAYAYAT YOU UPLOADED
1,200 vbuck skin 💀💀💀😭😭😭
Jojo: I’m inventing gay pop Wake me up before you go go by wham: 😐😐😐
today is my moms birthday but taylor swift is better then my mom
Jojo needs to listen to… idk. Just. Listen to queen. Or Elton John. Or David Bowie. Or wham!. Just put on an 80s hits playlist.
I can't wait to explode my gayness to her new genre of music
guys i think i found a leaked video of her dance video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8uu-GrFNLs
I like Shane better than Harvey. I can fix him.
I’m sorry out of all of the video all I got was you picked HARVEY in stardew..?!?!?
STARDEW VALLEY MENTIONED WOAAHHHH
She really said gaypop and didn't even mention Hayley Kiyoko. Now that's crazy.
CHAD IM DYING AT YOU EDITING THE 4 ELEMENTS WHILE U DO IT WHY IS IT SO PERFECT AND ON POINT THIS JUST MADE MY LIFE YOU ARE COMIC GENIUS 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The only thing that would make me forgive that “most extreme transition” comment is if she had put out a black metal album
I’m sorry I know this is off topic but HARVEY??? REALLY??????? Literally the worst bachelor in SD
ChadChad dancing: Everyone: "wow! She's really good!"
This is like giving a homeschooled kid mello yello when there parents arent there
As a man who loves JoJo’s bizarre adventure and is named Joe, I can’t stand her because I can’t call myself JoJo cus of her😭
BRO SHE DIDNT EVEN WRITE THE SONG
9:45 Took me OUT 😂😂😂😂😂
at some point i was waiting for chad chad to make this video
5:00 NAHHHH U CANT BE ATTACKING METTATONS SAD SONG WITH JOJO SIWA, METTATTON BE TWICE THE EDGE LORD SHE WOHLD BE CHAD CHAD CMONNNN ♡
It's going to be so fascinating in 15 years when she becomes her own person and we get the documentary about her entire existence being manipulated and micromanaged by her mother
0:01  YOU MEAN MY MAMA IS EDGY!?? 😱😱😱            Edit:this is a joke
i wish u talked about her allegedly stealing one of the songs on the album from an indie artist
Was this a jojo reference
ChadChad? JoJo?  I'm seeing a pattern here
Jojo's really out here cosplaying the Creature From The Black Lagoon I'm not angry about it, just making observations
Dude no way I was actually telling myself I would definitely think I'm water bending if I was doing those moves just from how much it feels like you're trying to move something that literally isn't there
god shes so cringe
I will not be seeking out the actual song because your copyright free version is just too good
Chad Chad? No, Dance Dance:)
I don't know how many times jojo has showed up in my feed by commentary channel now 😆
her constant live-blogging of this all feels like a bad marketing move there's no mystique or even excitement of anticipation when she's on social media giggling into her camera at all hours. shows how serious of an artist she is when she doesn't let the art speak for itself. ...
This feels like a 12 year old trying to sound grown up by swearing a lot. And she’s still hanging out with predators who reinforce her weird concepts of adult/child relationships that she learnt from being exploited for content as soon as she could walk.
Literally before chad chad said she looked like a kiss member or whatever I told my friend she looks like she would send a message to kiss and ask to be in their band if they were still alive I think I might be chad chad (not really)
Thank you so much for explaining who this person is. I literally had no idea.
How tf does she not know one the most iconic bands ever Kiss? Even young people know who they are.
Chad Chad: "This doesn't look like it requires recurring 12 hours sessions" Also Chad Chad: *breaks knee while attempting*
did she delete the vid?
She’s trying to prove she’s not the exploited child she was by… proving she still has a child’s understanding of what adulthood means and exploiting other kids…
“Where is the humping I wanna see humping-“ *disgusted and traumatized by the humping* 13:12
I really love aspestuse chad chad
Is she trying to emulate Lady Gaga, or Kiss?🤨
3:58 I watched this as my jlab earbuds my dad bought me proceeded to slip out of my ears and fall on the floor in agony.
Dude shes in my head and im like this trash
9:11 Harvey Stardew Valley mention lfg!! 🗣🗣
See, I cannot believe she and Tate Macrae are the same age, that's such a wild concept because Jojo still comes across as a child trying too hard to fit in with the adults unfortunately
Im so endlessly sick of this topic but 100% down to hear chad chads jokes on it all
Brit smith wrote the song, jojo and her team just stole a like 10 year old song
Omg as you explained her jerking body movements I just realized she's been possessed. It makes so much sense now
It’s like she’s upset she didn’t have a timer for when she turned 18. Another “pick me”
the funniest part is that she stole the whole damn song
YouTube music not only put her new song under family but they put it next to the toy story OST. not even the companies care to promote her in a different light.
She has always been a "bad girl", because she has defended multiple child predators.
You didn’t mention that she stole the song
Jojo is blowing up but not in the good type
really missed the opportunity for a bobobo bo bo bobo reference :(
None of the lyrics even make sense i fink she should go back to the candy store 🤓
i recognize one of the backup dancers and now im a bit sad bc i'd love to support him but i dont wanna support her </3
I just noticed the alien cake poster in the background that’s neat
no normal chad chad outro 😟 i don’t know how to cope without my “thaaaaaaaank you so much for watching!”
Ive watched about 8 different videos about Jojos descent into madness, but ive just been missing the Chad Chad flavor
Lil Tay had a better rebrand than this, she literally came back to life
I always knew Chad Chad was the avatar   (Not really)
I want to hear jenette mccurdy on this
YESYEYSES I WAS HOPING YOUD COVER THIS YESSSSSSS CHADCHAD❤❤🥰🥰
It's painful, because she has the same obnoxiously childish fast talking mumble talk. Her look is all "edgey and dark", but she's. The fucking. Same. No personality change. Nothing. And planning our her eras and shit. Lol.
i love you chad chad, pls dont die😢
9:12 i just started playing stardew valley a few days ago and im already hyperfixated. Currently trying to wife up Leah (even tho im aroace irl)
Dont forget shes not only friends with Shane Dawson but also Colleen Ballinger
Is this a... Jojo reference!?!
Is Joja Siwa just permanently going to tie her hair until her hairline perishes into another dimension
YES i was waiting for u to makea vid on this
FINALLY ANOTHER HARVEY LOVER. He's a saint.
I mean, Olivia Rodrigo definitely isnt an edgelord, but like next to JoJo she’s looks like her favourite pastime is summoning Satan for a gossip session. At least she can say the word fuck
That dog scream had me dying lmao
5:14 based tf2 song
The choreography is so odd 😭 this is the worst part to me
I almost threw up laughing at the dog yawning
her speaking voice can't be real
It seems pretty obvious that JoJo has never really experienced what a normal life is. 12 hour rehearsals and complete artistic control by adults is all she's ever known. It's hard for me to blame her for these mistakes even now, because I bet she's always just doing what others told her to and doesn't even realize she can do differently yet.  I bet we'll get a very ugly Britney Spears or Jeanette McCurdy style bombshell from her eventually. I hope she ends up ok.
In the black silver sparkling mess she kinda looks like a female 80’s ladies of Glow wrestler? Like
Me and my mom are literally face painters, the design does seem like something we would do 😭🤧
блин она чем-то как будто на катю адушкину похожа... это ее американская версия что ли
Hello Chad Chad, as A 32 year old the speed of your video and sound effects is overwhelming, and I will be taking that as a threat
To quote Jenny Nicholson: "I love when theater kids have to try to dress as their idea of 'hardcore'"
This is the only version of this song I want to hear. The dog yawn was beautiful
“New genre” *continues to list people in the same genre*
Dancing Chad Chad > dancing JoJo Siwa any day. Put Chad Chad on tour. #Chadtour2024
Her whole rebrand is to distract from the abuse reports. Its a strategic marketing move... and id say its working
She looks and acts like a female Jake Paul
Did she delete her old channel
Harvey from stardew valley is so real
I love that poster of the totally real movie you made with Pinely.
I thought she was going to become a professional wrestler ngl
That video about her choreography looks like she just got electrocuted 😭
On the plus side, Vanessa Bayer adds a new voice to her repertoire.
This is the first chadchad video I’ve had any previous knowledge of on first watch and somehow it made the video even more entertaining, the editing was 11/10 thank u
Saying you want to make "gay pop" a new genre after everything Sophie did...
So happy you uploaded
"The video is going to be crazy" *proceeds to do what t.A.T.u. did 20 years ago*   I wonder if she's actually lesbian or is just lesbian baiting people (which is actually pretty bad, but not in the way she expected).
Your cover of this song (as in, you singing it at the end of this video) was incredible. I think it perfectly captures the vibe Jojo was going for and I like it much better than the original! When are you releasing it on Bandcamp and Spotify?
I thought I was the only one who thought she looked like KISS 💀💀💀 8:35
just so you're aware mr. chad chad, it was the bending bit at 9:47 that made me press like on this video
Chad Chad i love you
Remember not to look directly at the rebranded JoJo without special safety glasses.  Even though she looks dark and edgy for a brief period, you can still get permanent eye damage.
I would love to see you and layze do a video collab, you guys are the best
Chadchad! You should have gone over the fact that she acts like she made the song BUT SHE DIDN'T. IT'S RECYCLED FROM SOMEONE ELSE THAT SCRAPPED IT (idr who because the name wasnt familiar to me when i heard it) ALSO THE FACT SHE HAS WEIRD BABY FEVER??? With her kids' names picked out and TATTOOED ON HER BODY ALREADY. My biggest issue with that is... not necessarily that she wants a baby, I mean she's weird about it and young, but... my major issue is that she'd be having these kids around people like Colleen and Shane...
Ace Frehley
5:25 fr tho the switch from comeback song to traitor was crazyyyyy
You're the only person I like watching for youtube drama
Doesnt matter if youre a fan or a hater, overhyping something will always polarize the reactions negatively into dissapointment or cringe.
She literally looks like the next kiss member
Erm this is embarrassing but Harvey is my husband Chad Chad /j
I get wanting to break away from the crooked ponytail and bow wearing persona from when you were younger, but just be your normal self now that you’re older?  Why do you have to have a knockoff Kiss outfit? Why do you have to jump from one look to another look? Just be 21 year old Jojo or whatever and figure out who you want to be 🤷🏻‍♀️
Something about this whole phase really gives me the ick. It could be that the cringe is that intense, but I feel like something is going on behind the scenes
Does she not know KISS? Because that's so funny
this is the first time I heard about her and I already hate her so much
You’re description of dance moms was sadly on point
WE DONE WITH DA '90s!!!!!!!!!
4:53 loving the undertale music in the background
Certainly one of the songs of all time 😐
you should make a video on char chad's standing era, it's even more cringe than this
For some one "edgy" there is a LOT of white in the music video XD
She’s auditioning for a backup dancer role
The sound effects are killing me asjgkd
considering her music is stolen it’s even crazier they’re flops
I’m sorry, that clip of JOJO cutting people off in traffic really made me angry, the audacity… she doesn’t just need to learn how to sing again, she needs to learn how to drive.
Sitting Chad Chad makes me deeply uncomfortable
i can tell shes going for a black metal corpse paint look (... i think..?) but she does it so bad
she's acting like she INVENTED being gay 😭
YESSSS
I love how Jojo is talking about this 'new genre' as if badass-bait songs aren't already a thing. Jake Daniels, Neoni, UPSAHL, grandson, Ellise, and so many others have already made their place in the music industry specifically making that exact type of content but infinitely better.  at least be honest if you change roads. this transition is just par for the course at this point
it's giving Starlight Express costume design
Liking the video just for the audio clip of Cody and Noel
I saw her hips once.  Such a hot, and poised young lady.
i saw the ISWM poster there, Chad chad, you can’t hide from us😳
good to know that your fyp is always full of harvey edits to that hozier song
naw that makeup is NOT kiss Thats face battle😭💀💀
idk who you are but you have a new subscriber cs why are u so funny and pretty ??? 🧍🏻‍♀️🧍🏻‍♀️
Mother trucker dude, that song hurt like a butt cheek on a stick.
i think its actually brilliant. the zoomers cant see it because they are zoomers too but from outside, its masterpiece shit. Amazing satire
Lol
What would be wild and crazy would be her letting her head breathe from them damn ponytails.
It's like she's being brainwashed that what she's doing is not embarrassing at all.
I'm still watching her as an eight year old and I loved the new song and I like her even more
HARVEY FROM STARDEW VALLEY😭💀
I don't know who this girl is, but I saw a comment about this whole thing as, "When you give the homeschooled kid his first Mountain Dew at the sleepover", and it feels 100% accurate. This is someone sipping a beer at 16 years old and acting wasted.
OMG CHAD CHATMDDMssddsDDD!!!!!!!!
She’s giving Ellen plus Debbie Ryan Disney Era
I think she's just a kid figuring shit out after being controlled for so long. :/ I hope shes okay.
the fact that she didn't even write the song anyway... like what was she trying to gain 😭
Harvey ???
Was Jojo too young to remember how Miley was naked on a recking ball, because I feel like it was a way bigger transition.
Harvey is taking over all the girlies this week, what’s his secret?
BABE WAKE UP NEW CHAD CHAD
Jojo is the Wish version of Kiss. She is Cringe AF!!! Car wrapped in her face. Wearing a T-shirt with her Face. No one loves Jojo more than Jojo. She is the female Jake Paul🙄🙄🙄🙄
she did warn us abt the video and i was still shocked. not in a good and “wow new hot artist alert” more like “call the police i am having a heart attack turn this off”
Chaaad! Please make a video about the youtuber HoustonJones. He makes this thirst traps where people hurt him and label it as science or beauty or whatever. It really looks to me like a... like-ish, as you once called it.
'I'M GETTING GOOD!' good job Chad! You somehow managed to do it better without 12 hour rehersals.
The amount of references in this video, Chad Chad! Stardew, Jojo's, the frickin fnaf vhs tapes??? So good!! Also, you seem like a harvey kisser /gen
JoJo be having that “oW tHe EdGe” moment
jojo's career change is the exact same vibe as kids on twitter turning 18 to immediately go MINORS DNI
I got my bf to watch a chad chad video with me B)
I'm personally grateful for the countdown timer on ChadChad's ad-roll.
dashonalieee 😍 dashonachiii 😍😍
lmfaoaoao it was chad chad moving earth water and fire so easily for us 😭😭😭
HARVEY???
Well now shes exploiting children, shes "rebranding" due to not just being friends with james charles and collen ballienger but also because of her exploiting kids too also this song was written 5 years ago and the writer wanted to sell it to miley and now JoJo has it an is pretending she wrote it herself
Y’all she’s so young and was raised in a berating Hollywood environment aren’t we being a bit harsh and not acknowledging how difficult it must be to escape the crippling perfectionist complex she probably developed as a child on dance moms?
i loved the dance break ❤️
I still have no idea who this person is
Not the bending during the dance ☠
THE CAT- ON 11:57 BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE A EXACT REPLICA OF MY CAT 😭😭😭😭
I was waiting for this
love how the twinge of cringe gets slightly shorter and more exasperated every time
5:16  ARCHIMEDES!!!!!
I can't believe Chad Chad forgot to do her iconic outro again guys :,( I feel more betrayed than when I got viruses after trying to install mlp frienship is magic on my pc
wow, it's so original it's like 2013 era Miley Cyrus never happened
Glad Chad Chad is covering this mess
WHAT THE-
I was a bagel💥
Sick shirt Chad
dude u never fail to make me laugh
This reason is why I made a YouTube channel: To make people laugh, or to make people feel happy.
kissing and smooching harvey is so real
i’ve been waiting on the right person to make this video🙏
My problem at first wasn’t with karma itself but the fact that she is clearly trying to hide the allegations of work abuse, then I found out even the song is stolen!
Your version of karma is better
I think becoming a "bad girl" after they turn 18 is basically a requirement for female child stars
Lol this is only the debut guys... buckle yourselves up 😭😭
Desperation to become a successful pop icon
was it edgy? technically, yes. was it good? WAS IT GOOD??
"Jojo's New Era" Traumatized child star develops a personality disorder in real-time while perpetuating trauma to a whole new generation of children.
She's dancing like Yung Sherman in the Kyoto vid
I didn’t understand the situation but now chad chad has told me about it I completely understand
Why is my biggest takeaway is that you romance Harvey in Stardew  I don’t blame you but
my first introduction to jojo siwa was one time when i was 16 i got in a car crash and jojo and her mom were the first people to stop and help us (this was in omaha & it was while her season of abby lee's ultimate dance competition was airing)
The number of artists who have done 🌈gay🌈 before and *better* than she's doing it... but she acts like she invented it.
When she came out as a lesbian I thought she was just being a poser - like obviously she's allowed to genuinely be gay, but it just felt like a "hey guys I'm cool and relevant" reveal to me, and this "edgy" rebrand didn't change anything. Like, I don't know how to explain what I mean, it's not like she can't be a lesbian because she's peppy, it's just it felt like a calculated corporate reveal coming from her?
It’s embarrassing, especially in public because you can see her walking down that weird corridor with people on both sides of her and when she stops to pose to the camera, you can see girls in the back laughing at her
Jojo's transition is whatever but CHAD CHAD IS A HARVEY GAL?????
RAAAAHHHH TATE MCRAE MENTIONED 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jessica siwa took me out
9:12 harvey gang rise up (on an air balloon)
We really should have listened to the warning cause that was Traumatizing 😂😂
I love Chad Chad
The JJBA references was awesome , by the way, who's your favorite jojo?
"gay pop", tf? you know what song is technically gay pop? friday. friday by rebecca black is gay pop
chad chad made the best cover of karma confirmed
Jojo actually stole the song 😭😭😭 if you look up “karmas a bitch 2012” you will find the exact lyrics and tone from this song 😭😭
jojo siwa needs to start treating her throat better or she won't have a voice to sing with in a few years. yeesh that scratchiness at 3:20 hurt to *hear*
5:25 the bizaardvark reference😭
The second i saw this in my inbox, my edge INSTANTLY ended! Oh.. thank you.. this is JUST what i needed to bus.. ohh.. uh.. AHHHH IM COMING..!😫😫😫 heres a cup of, "milk" for your troubles🥛🥛😉😉
Of course you like Harvey should have expected that much form you/s
Quoting the wise words of Jaiden animations is how you know ChadChad definitely knows what shes talking about 🙏
It's sad that people looked at what Britney went through, and thought it a good example to follow.   Like some endless tale of childhood superstardom endlessly retold.
WE STAN HARVEY
As a guy person, people that try to do things that are supposed to expose people to gay content and then make thar content hypersexual just hurts us because it just confirms people beliefs that the gay community is hypersexual and full of groomers and stuff
Yeah, I'm a bad girl. My mommy told me so.
Why does she remind me of KRIS?
i feel like i came back 50x straighter when i saw that music video   (I’m a lesbian)
I get that it's weird, but should we be piling on to a woman that's been in the public eye since she was a child...
She looks like Ryuk now
i think jojo is going thru early 20’s edginess lol she’s just being young and dumb
I liked for the jo mama joke
Her dropping this laughable, palpably forced rebrand around the same time that allegations broke of abuse committed by her and her mother on the dance show they hosted is,,, convenient.
As someone who had a friend go on the Jennifer Hudson show for doing something much more considerate and helpful for people , seeing that emo puke on there makes me mad
"JOJO HAVE YOU LEARNT NOTHING!!!"
You should listen to the original song, it’s on YouTube and it’s so much better
we need to talk about her mom and management team as well TBH
Love the market plier poster in the back
For this being her edgy, out-of-control "era", she sure is painfully tailored to match a rival pop star in a PG Disney channel original movie.   The actual edgy thing she did as of late was support Colleen Ballinger so I'm surprised she didn't lean into that for her marketing.
9:47 literally had me in TEARS I love the editing
JoJo's bizarre adventure
ok rebrand all you want, but to claim that you are the pioneer of all things queer and act like you are the only gay person ever is just pretty demeaning i think
Ah yes the talk of the internet, Jo......  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...mama  (I don't know what you were expecting me to say.)
4:12 I have the same blanket! 😂❤(White leafy one)
I legit feel kinda bad for her. She was prolly sheltered af growing up and she's just trying to act more mature and she literally doesn't know how because of her upbringing. It's sad. Obviously she's being cringe but at least it's harmless, she's not being mean or trying to hurt anyone.
chad chad giving up on her outro 💔💔💔💔
The Adults behind this Need to STOP!
I would also kiss and smooch Harvey from Stardew Valley for 12 hours straight.
Earlyyyyy
No idea who this girl is
"you were an accident"
thank god ive been.playing cassette beasts lately because the music from that game is very good at blocking karma from invading my brain like it has everypony else's
Can't waaaait for your next 9mo cruise video!!!! 🛳️
Damn didn’t realize you were a Harvey fan… respect
9:12 the Harvey smooching is so relatable I love him even though he still charges  you even if you’re married🥲
Keep my mother out of this >:(
ok but you’re so real for harvey. he is my lover
OMG I WAS PRAYING YOU WOULD MAKE A VIDEO ON THIS
Did the title have “ugly” instead of “edgy” in it, or did I hallucinate that?
Why do u kinda look like kallmakris? Maybe its the hair but u look like her
MOJO Jojo siwa's bizarre adventure time machine.. You're welcome 😎
Could have played just dance on the Wii for 12 hours and gotten better results
The casual ableism too.
9:14 kissing Harvey is so real
chad chad i love your videos please don't get abducted by aliens and stuff
Happy belated birthday
Gojo Seesaw’s outstanding wisdom of the day: “Karma’s a bitch.”
jjba 10:26
Chadchad decorates like the "rate my setup. Dudes only" meme
they prolly think I'm a psycho 😎😫🤬 Nah, more cringe-meister ngl
as usual, an overworked girl in the media industry is becoming cringey and problematic. hey, just an idea, maybe the problem is the industry and the parents who let their kids join it?
She wants to be Miley Cyrus so bad, even to the point of using a song Miley herself rejected
So... Being a bad girl means being queer? "omg I'm such a psycho, so badass" babe go watch some of Ashnikko's music videos But I don't really wanna pin this on Jojo. She's been raised as a child star by a clearly abusive mom. She's probably been told what to do, what to say, she's just a puppet. Poor thing.
Didnt know chad chad is the avataar
Jojo went full gene simmons by defending groomers and wearing his makeup
i miss the old “a twinge of cringe” pronunciation
fml not the AVATAR REFERENCEEEE
remember spiderman 3 when Peter gets the new aeshetic of the black suit and thinks he's a badass kinda 'bad dude' but he's actually just a nice normal nerdy dude's idea of what assholes with egos are like, not far off tbf. He goes around looking goofy not like a badass. this is exactly like that down to the dance routines. also 10/10 vid chad
A family member of mine has epilepsy, and seeing Jojo going through the same thing warms my heart. Thank you so much I will stream Karma 24/7 ❤❤ /j
she really do be in her own little world huh
i liked this version more than the real one
0:34  jojo and claire’s go hand in hand when it comes to toxic and bad makeup (and with bows, too.)
WHOA EDGY
Babe wake up, new chadchad video
Bye
"What's been in your head the last three days?" Suicidal ideation. JoJo. Thanks for asking.
All of the sudden im glad I got bullied off for liking her at 10-12 years old 😭😭
Just a phase
Me: I’m not a liberal snowflake wth are those boomers on about? Chadchad: forgets to thank us at the end of the video Me: 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 where’s my thankyou 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
thank you for editing in the elements during your choreo LMAO literally as soon as you started dancing, I was like "ChadChad is the Avatar we need, but don't deserve"
I think it's so funny how so many people are talking about this. The music video had some beautiful shots in it, obviously the song is trash because it's Jojo and that's been her brand: cringy. It's nothing new. She just went from rainbow cringe to goth cringe. She is the same Jojo doing the same stuff just in a different color and age.
She was right, there was a extreme thing... the thing she did to Alexis warr (red girl) 💀💀💀
Jojo is like a Disney kid that didn't do Disney lol, she's having her teenage rebellion it's unfortunate she has a large audience
Jojo Siwa thinks lesbian sexual intercourse or attraction is big bad scandalous, also KISS Make Up is really weird and psycho. I mean they for sure don´t play this video in Saudi Arabia i guess.
There really is a difference between "going off the rails so disney (who has controlled my life) has no choice but to let me go" and "everyone has to have a bad girl era sometime!"
The fact that KPOP music vids don't have a 60 fps option while a reaction/commentary video does is baffling to me
What was going on with her tv and the black lines on it can anyone explain?
watcing Jojo straight up fuckin . hump that chick is so str a n g e   to me because like . in my head she's still the kid she was before, so even though she's legal now it still feels illegal LKASJDASKLJDLKJDLASJD
Omg Kaos from Skylanders had a makeover 😍❤️❤️❤️
I genuinely forget jojo siwa isnt still like 13 anymore. Like, she's not that much younger than me lol.
Nah but this song feels like a fever dream
Your version of the song is better than the original 😂❤
All I can see every time that woman JoJo speaks is Airsoftfatty. Wow, the world we live in 😂
YOU KNOW OR PLAY STARDEW VALLEY girl this game is so underground and underrated
Jojo siwa scares me so much I am afraid  She's so edgy and mature now 😰
This album of hers is legitimately concerning and disturbing in a way a disclaimer could never rectify
Fiddlesticks
Praying for your knee 😔
10:00 keep practicing, you'll reach super sayian in no time.
9:47
It almost brings me to tears with pride about how unified the internet has been over this 🥹🥹
a dancing chad chad wasn't in my bingo card
Look out Jojo! The AVATAR challenges you to a dance off!   Thank you for your service Cha-Cha 🙏
There was so little chemistry between Jojo and the other woman that they might as well have been filing taxes
JoJo acting like those kids who go "You don't wanna see my dark side" 💀
https://youtu.be/v3eYjDJdI5k?si=HE0j6VDIbf4MDv1W  The original song by Brit Smith
But can we talk about how they almost break each other’s pelvises by doing The Worm onto each other, chest first, while STANDING?
I just wanna know where Chad Chad gets her shirts
Fun fact: she didn't actually write the song, but rather bought the rights of it and kept it as a "secret"  Karma is a bitch something something
Oh my god the interviewer just smiling and nodding is so funny hes just like mhm sure youre the first yup
Why chad chad is doing martial arts 9:37
And now I've heard of her thanks to your video. Guess her marketing worked.
1:28 EY LADS KISS JR BE PLAYIN AT THE THUNDADOME INNIT.
Chad Chad while dancing: "I'm getting better!!"  The neon sign behind her: 👀👀
Oh yaaaay, Chadchad is here to explain what my students have been talking about.
She is clearly whacked out on whatever "Dr. Feelgood" has prescribed her for the serious case of  Fameseekingitus  she has contracted
AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA SHE LOOKS LIKE A DORK. Privileged white girl trying to be edgy and failing never fails to make me laugh.
The girl group stuff sounds absolutely terrible but my question is why is a disabled girl with specifically muscle related issues wanting to join a dance heavy girlband? Am I missing something?
Jojo should have called her dance crew the "bizarre adventure", since there are seven Jojos and clearly there is tragedy involved.
9:52 the prophecy is true!
she looks like she's cosplaying a monster energy
🙋🏻‍♀️Former Claire’s Creative Director here. Jessalynn is 100% behind the branding and yes, her taste, manners, personality and class are as bad as you would assume.
how many times have we seen this before
the modt shocking part of the video is honestly the harvey comment, like wdym you have life outside of videos 😨
This turned me into asbestos 🎉
"nobody's ever made this dramatic of a change"  me remembering when Lindsay Lohan went from just being a young person my age to a cokefiend
I love that she's like "Oh yeah I was a bad girl" meanwhile she was afraid to say Fuck
Holy rusted bucket! Dagnabbit.
This is, in fact, Jojo's bizarre adventure 💀
I dont blame jojo for wanting a rebrand but its sad for her to go from being different to being cliché
Jojo, sitting in dispair in her recording studio, sees a tiny butterfly breeze to her side. As it touches her oversized hairbow, a voice enters her mind...  Hawkmoth: "Karma! You wish to be recognized. You wish to no longer be seen as a child! I can help you show everyone just how mature you have become... And in return, all I ask for... is LADYBUG AND CAT NOIR'S MIRACULOUS!"  Jojo: "Yes. I'll do it. I'll show everyone!"  The moth dissolves into a purple mist blanketing Jojo's body, until she becomes... KARMA, the gargantuan griefer of gay-pop!
one of those "im not like other girls" people who once again IS like those other girls.
I was like why are y'all mad at a child but she's 20 years old apparently wow the progression of time doesn't even occur to me lol
one thing i know is that the 12 hour rehearsals are very normal lol i’m a dancer (not even a professional one, i do wreck) and 12 hour rehearsals are very common especially before shows😭 they’re terrible and i hate them but it is very normal in the dance world
I thought I was safe from Harvey in a Chad Chad Jojo Siwa re-brand video but alas
not enough people are talking about the song not even being hers 😭
Wow a funky frog vid about this and now a Chad Chad video this is the best couple days of my life 🤩  (The only way Ik about Internet drama is through commentary yt)
I forgot about that name.  I wish it stayed that way...
i'm starting to think that abby lee is starting to reget to teach jojo
I just found your channel and your hilarious 🤣
jojo is giving the energy of me saying fart for the first time when i was like 7
Tossing out the Four Nations Avatar Dance in there 😂
Honestly I kinda like the music and rebrand is pretty cool, I would like her if she didn’t hang out with creeps and assist in the abuse of that poor girl
AAA I JUST GOT DONE WATCHI G FUNKYFROGBAITS VIDEO ON THIS
9:09 nah he loves to take my money and items 😭
Chad Chad if you like Stardew Valley you should try Sun Haven or Coral Island!!
9:11 Me too, me too.
I wonder if this is to distract everyone from the fact she and her mother abused children.
Jojo needs help...she needs help in realizing that she isn't relevant anymore
4:14 omg twinsies i own that mop too 😊😊
btw she also bought or stole the song and claims she wrote it. (It came from Miley Cyrus then Miley Cyrus gave it too britt smith) which Jojo said it took 2 years to write but idk she barely changed anything
She's trying too hard.
The result of no self awareness...
not to mention she bought the song and claimed it as her own this whole time
Chad Chad’s knee broke so hard I got an ad, that’s crazy
She thinks she can just up and be ashnikko
It fun y how she thinks she the only one who did this and she so special and did something crazy and worth praising for
Wait, that penis plushy is kinda cute ngl LOLOLOLOL
Her bragging like she wrote a song a 9 year old could write and it’s not even hers 😭😭
okay but if shes gay why did she go to a sex shop and buy that plushie
Jojo got akumatized 💀
Why am I not surprised that Chad's favorite romanceable NPC from Stardew is Harvey? (Based btw, just like me fr fr)
I'm so confused by this whole thing. It feels like a parody of when a squeaky clean pop star develops a bad reputation.
no more evildoing for you, little akuma😭😭
She’s acting like Miley Cyrus in that horrible black mirror episode
her voice is perfect for grunge
9:46  love the Avatar reference 🤘
She didn't need to do this to have a controversial image as she is friends and has openly defended child groomers
Chad's version of Karma needs to be dropped on Spotify and iTunes NOW, that was such a banger
She reminds me of those "disney channel vs euphoria" parody shorts in terms of edginess
NGL but she kinda looks like one of the engines from starlight express
She didnt even write the song toooo like cmon 💀
EY0?! TF2 music??? :0000
If you asked an 8 year old to describe what being an adult was like, I reckon it’d be something like this
She looks like a WWE wrestler promoting for her shot at the championship belt
i lowkey thought chad chad died....
The Jojo reference❤
Is this all just her distracting from her scandals,ie the rolling stones article?
Me waking up and getting out of bed in the morning is a more dramatic shift istg 😭
im having a chronic pain flair up and feeling very seen by you chad thank you for also having knee pain <3
Petition for Chad Chad to release the full Chad Chad rendition of “Karma” —> “Charma”
This performative edginess while defending child predators is a wild combo. I don't think anyone cares about her (checks notes) wearing black and being gay.
i was kissing AND smooching harvey from stardew valley throughout the duration of this video  i jumped when you mentioned it
STARDEW VALLEY MENTIONED 🔥🔥🔥
The way I see it, she’s going through a belated version of her cringy teen era.
Whoever put that face paint on her but didn't make sure she knew who Gene Simmons was did her dirty. That's mortifying.
Bruh I literally have that Plush I’ve had it for years lol
of COURSE she’s friends with shane dawson 😭
Bread
Why do I feel like a collab between Funkyfrogbait, Film Cooper, and Chad Chad would be awsome? They have all done a video on this topic and they are pretty close in dates. Anyway, with the claims coming out about what Jojo has allegedly done, her career is going to implode. Also the version of a “bad girl” that she is trying to rebrand herself as is like a Disney channel bad girl. And the treatment of the disabled girl, who has a spine issue that causes pain doing things physical, is absolutely horrendous! The girl and her mother moved from Texes to be able to do this show, and then they fired her and her mother after trying to speak up. I thought that after Dance Moms, she would make a show that was the complete opposite of that, which is what she described her show as, just as abusive and strenuous. I hope the girl and her mother are okay and that Jojo and her mother open their eyes and see what’s going on around them.
thank u for ur vids they make me laugh :)
I’m bisexual and I hope we as queers can unilaterally decide not to claim her anymore
you didnt mention the fact that it's not even her song😭😭
I didn't even know jojo siwa was over 18
if shes gen z, i refuse to believe so
I like your shirt can I steal it
this was your 69th video
this was a cool vid thanks comedy hayley williams
Yk I wasn't expecting the reveal of you liking Harvey but it checks out
Jojo is so basic
Im surprised you didn't mention the whole thing about this song being from Brit Smith in 2012 & originally recorded by Miley Cyrus in 2011. I noticed that the song sounded too "good" for todays standards (aka the song seemed cohesive rather than trying deperately for a single part to work well on TikTok like most songs do nowadays) and found this out on my own before immediately seeing a video talking about it.
9:29 Wow! ChadChad Great moves, keep it up! Proud of you.
the list of rebranded child stars is incomplete… this is dove cameron erasure!!
HOLY SHIT?! IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?!!!
I feel like I was watching a Disneymovie watching that music video
Oh wow both you and FunkyFrogBait posted about this :0
i really wish she would stop constantly having her hair high and tight. like i would pay a billion dollars for her to give her scalp a fuckin break.
Chad… why Harvey…
I can't get over her little face paint situation looking like a 90's bass guitar player's beard. It's so weird!! It's so weird. Why does she have a beard.
a child that was pushed into the limelight and was brought up on attention seeking not beeing mentaly stable? im shocked.
Miley didn't twerk for this disrespect.  Honestly as far as switching to more "grown up" themes, good for her. But the constant hyping is... Eesh...
CHADCHAD IS A HARVEY FAN WE WIN
I'm sorry, HARVEY? There are so many men in Stardew Valley and you pick HARVEY??
its also the fact that she didnt even write the song. its an unreleased song from 2012 made by Brit Smith and Miley Cyrus.
The fact she didn’t know who gene simmons was even though she looks like an offbrand version of him stunned me 💀
9:36 Holy crap chad^2 you’re could totally be one of jo^2 s backup dancers
In a year, coming to Trainwreckords
new chad lore dropped: cussing bangs
8:13-8:17 GOT ME IN THE GUT 😂😂😂 Oh myyyy hahaha “it’s giving facepaint at a fair”
Idk what it is but people mentioning JJBA in this Jojo situation makes me so happy
i guess you could say jojo can't be tamed
The way they predicted her whole song "Karma's a bitch" "I was a bad girl" LMAO
9:47 water earth fire air, only the avatar could control all 4 elements..
favorite thing i've seen from all of this is someone stitching her "what's been stuck in your head the last three days" tiktok with smosh's submissive and breedable lmao
no, is she having a miley moment
i never thought i would see the day where chad chad dances yet here we are
8:13-8:17 GOT ME IN THE GUT 😂😂😂 Oh myyyy hahaha
She use to look like a unicorn aesthetic now she looks like the human white girl version of Godzilla
I hope I'm wrong, but, I think she might be as bad as when the Kardashians were younger, or like when Snooki was popular on the Jersey Shore. She's going to have a stick up her arse for yearsssssss. Though it's definitely due to her mother which is unfortunate.
Idk she’s 20 and has been in the spotlight since she was a kid, I honestly just pity her.
We need more dog content
The worst part of all this is that I've had the chorus of that terrible karma song stuck in my head for 2 days.
She kinda looking like a villain from Power Rangers or something - I think I’d name the character Queen Cringe
when you said her mum is behind it , everything clicked in my brain this girl is still being absolutely used and I cant even be sure if she knows it or if she has really been that brainwashed (which is normal for a child star); a shame whatsoever
Jojo Siwa is in her teenage pk era
:]
CHAD CHAD!
Karma is Jojo’s song in the same way the decor on my walls is “my” art, in that I bought it and own it but did not create it
girl thinks she’s going to be the protagonist of part 10 at this point 😭
Gayz pop!  I support LGBTQ but I found this funny
I think it's the way she talks about herself like a fan would. actually I've been seeing a lot of pop girlies do that or when tiktok songwriters do the intro thing of "guys I think I wrote the song of the year!" like it's so cringe bc you're not the one who's supposed to say those things about your work 😵‍💫 you should let others do it, let your work speak for itself god dammit I'm sick of the new way everyone's been promoting their music, it's giving second hand embarrassment
Her "gay pop" interview sounds EXACTLY like the way that Trump tells stories. Word for word.
Someone please help me. What is that music at 4:53 again? It makes me feel nostalgic but I can't recall what game it's from
Her rebrand is like if you told a 12yo to just "go out there and be the baddest girl you can be"
today's twinge of cringe intro was a litte rushed... chadchad are you getting tired of your only series on this channel?
It's funny how she stuck with pop. You'd think she'd go for something else if she was trying to be edgy lol
9:10 CHAD CHAD IS A HARVEY FAN??? I'M JUMPING FOR JOY AND KICKING MY LEGS WITH GLEE RN
YES fellow harvey romancer <3 <3
YouTubers must be running out of interesting things to talk about
Shoutout to Brit Smith, who did it originally and better
"new song"??? maybe this one will have been written within the past decade
i just fond out that Olivia rodrigo was in bizaardvark
You didn’t thank me for watching you video >:( I clicked on yours out of aaaaaall the ones out there. I don’t think I WILL see you next time. BYE.
9:10 she’s so real for that
Me: In funeral. Also me: Sorry I have to go to the bathroom! *Pulls out phone since I don’t even know the dead person*
10:28 so many jojos and yet you missed the best one :(
I can't get my head around the fact that "karma", a song that... exists, and "cure" from alien stage, a genuinely emotional song, was released on the SAME DAY
what the crap??? Holy guacamole!!1!1!1!!!
No way Chad Chad ended the video like that were was the send off lol
MOTHER IS BACK!!
10:01 not the video crashing trying to load an 'ad' the moment your knee 'cracked' lmao
this is the fakest edgy era i've ever seen like say what you will about miley cyrus's post-disney career she was being incredibly genuine with her rebellion against the disney manufactured image of her, and here jojo siwa is basically using a whole ass subculture's fashion (from the wrong era even) to pretend she's making a bigger image shift than any child star before her
I really hate the idea of doing a twinge of cringe episode on a 20 y/o queer woman for being a bit weird? Let her find her style and rhythm. Don't make fun of her for experimenting.    I'm sorry, but this actually crosses into punching down and feels gross. unsub.
the elements editing was actually funny
whomever the person is that created this video, I love them!
She's always been an obnoxious mess, but I honestly thought she had faded away over time. It's very surprising to see that she's still got a following of any sort, considering her only talent is basically just being annoying.
I’m afraid, I miss the old her. Idgaf if she’s still a lesbian. Idgaf if she cuts her hair short. But what the fuck is this shit??? And that is coming from a gothic/emo person too like💀😭
I know this isn’t the topic of the video, or maybe this has been a thing for a while- and I’m sorry. But I swear I heard Tf2 music in a part of the video???? Am I going insane??? I’m in Tf2 limbo please help me
I was a bald girl
funkyfrogbait whoo
This is the kind of stuff my religious granny would find 'edgy', also it still looks like her aesthetic just in black. Also I think most of the hate or drama comes from the way she talks about her rebrand, it sounds childish and egotistic. I'm not saying this to be rude but seriously she is acting like a middle schooler who just discovered creepypastas
Team Harvey!!! Let's goooo🛫
where buy deer shirt chadchad
Fun fact - she stole a song for her new album from a tiktoker 😢
Never thought I would hear the words gay pop come out of jojo Siwa’s mouth on my birthday
She's a bad girl who effed around, so effing cool, i love the gothic harley quinn and her effing effed up  bad girl schtik, so cool she wont even say fuck
As a old guy in his 50s, I can assure you this glam KISS look isn't cool in the oldster's eyes either.  It would have got you laughed off the stage in the 80s by anyone that wasn't a KISS fanatic.  This is just prime grade A clueless bible-belt stage-mom idea of what an edgy rockstar is.  I cringed so hard I threw out my back.
i was a bald girl
4:37 adskip
Chad Chad's bending skills are enough to make her the true Avatar.
I'm so sick and tired of hearing about this Jojo person I'm starting to understand why Dio ended up like he did
was waiting for this
we love the jjba reference but hate that its in a jojo siwa vid
girl read one fanfiction and saw one kpop video and this is what happened
Appreciate the added Undertale music.
CHAD is cannot BELIEVE you are a Harvey fan. He is a lame little pee boy
shes goin throuugh the Sarah Lynn arc
lol Jojo trying to be lady Gaga.
Not the troy bolten water splash
jojo is not okay rn i swear ☠️. She out here stealing the song "Karma" by brit smith in 2012 not changing any word apart from like adding effed around or smth. dont even start me with that dance aswell i thought being in dance mums would atleast give her some idea on how to not dance like that. And that music video.☠️
OMG I WAS WAITINTG FOR A COMMENTARY YOUTUBER TO MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT THSI YESTERDAY
So jojo wants to talk about how she did in fact cheat on her ex??
The elements were PEAK
seeing chad dance honestly made my day
Some might say Jojo is being quite ... bizarre
I’ve watched several YouTubers talk about this but chadchad becoming the avatar makes this the best one
Wow. Not even a thank you for clicking on *your* video out of alllllll the other videos on here. The lack of gratitude is wild!
I just have one question, What was the warning for?? What is mature about this?? Is it the small clip of her thrusting upwards and flipping that girl in red while in the water? Or is it the face caressing she does to the two girls? IM CONFUSED, JOELLE!
Nice Cody and Noel sound bit 😂😂😂 I love that ❤️
9:13 harvey?!? of all people…
hope it makes her heaps of money 🤦🏻‍♀️
has Jojo ever come out with anything about how she said she wrote the song and then people found out it was Brit Smith's and how her "new song" is from a tiktok singer? Like, has she done her Apology Video™ about it yet?
As an actual psychotic, I wish 'psycho' could be phased out of casual vernacular. like it's not the worst thing I've been called or the most offensive thing in the world, but it still makes me mildly uncomfortable to hear my condition used as an insult
Not inventing gaypop
She got pregnant and then turned emo
Earlyyy
Jojo uses “they/them” but also “bad girl”? Just asking here, I don’t know anything about them. I just personally prefer they/them as well but I would feel misgendered by “bad/good girl”.
9:13 HARVEY?? of all people…
I wanted to buy them, so I clicked on the link and there was text saying „hello chad chad viewers…. Enter code LOVING for 20% off“ So I picked the earbuds went to checkout and entered the codes and my details. THEN they asked me how I want my shipping, which I would have to pay 15€ for. I thought u said free shipping. It doesn’t work. I’m truly disappointed.
The song has 1.1 MILLION dislikes
she hit her head with a boomerang 😓
i think it’s camp
And 5 minutes later, Jojo is forgotten again.
Christina Aguilera tried this and it also didn’t work.
Chad Chad's the avatar
"Fiddlesticks" *faints*
atleast i dont have to watch it now. thank u
chad the dog yawning had me queefing
PeachesTV is probably rolling her eyes until they sprain...
It’s such a shame to hype of everyone with a new song only for it to not even be written by her. Quite embarrassing.
Dog was more fun to watch than Jojo or Chadchad.
Harvey liker spotted
as someone who doesnt like harvey from stardew vallley, today is truly a sad day
I'm surprised Chad Chad didn't talk about the fact that this song isn't even an original. this is just a cover of a song that already existed called 'karma' by Brit Smith. joio claims she's reinventing music with someone else's song 😂
I just found your channel and I literally love you😭❤️
The beginning😭✋
We need an interview from the person Jojo "humped"
it’s giving WWE
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE A HARVEY STAN! I bet Charlie is your favorite character in twilight
The only thing that truly bothers me is she's always wearing the same edgy outfit same hair same everything
how did she say she was inventing gay pop and then go on to mention artists who did it before her in the same breath??
"I'm gonna invent a new genre" *names songs that already exist*
“ATwinge offfff cringe 😐”
CHAD CHAD UR LATE
the knee breaking made me laugh so hard.
I liked seeing Chad-Chad smiling and laughing, but I felt pretty empty that she didn't acknowledge that I watched her video out of all the videos available here.
i dont like that she said she wrote it when she literally just bought someone elses unreleased song and tweaked the background and added a swear
she's so young yet she sounds like a 50 year old smoker
I love asbestos
I salute you for your dedication.
Jojo just feels like the spoiled brat wanting to rebell but not enough to loose the ability to suckle from momma's wallet. ... i mean bussom.
i literally forgot the main topic of this video after mentioning harvey congrats on the best choice🤝🤝
why she look like shes in wwe in that black bedazzled outfit
Jojo reference
9:46 holy shit she’s the avatar
JOJO REFERENCE (the good one) LETS GOO🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Not a Tik-Toker, not yet a YouTuber
you're funny but your editor is hilarious
The problem is she still has a face like a 4 year old.
using KISS as an inspiration is so on brand, it's practically perfect. like KISS would be about Jessalynn Siwa's time and KISS has been so commercialized to hell that i dunno what they don't have merch of. not to mention the style of the band vs their sounds is so contrasting
Btw she stole this unreleased song and claimed it as her own
she doesn't seem to catch that sudden dramatic changes come from a bad place. You either were forced to be someone you're not and only managed to let yourself break free way too late in life or you got traumatized enough to be unable to be who you used to be. Dramatic changes are rarely, if just never voluntary
11:00 FNAF ANALOG HORROR REFERENCE
This isn't what a 50 year old sees as edgy, this is what an 80 year old sees as edgy. (Source: am 50 years old, and this feels like what my own mom might consider edgy)
on top of everything that music video is actually traumatizing
First time viewer, I must admit this was hilarious and I don't even know who this person is.
I miss old JoJo, JoJo that wasn't JoJo Siwa. She was at least a good singer 😩
honestly the thing that pisses me off the most abt this song and the rebrand is that she thinks she’s being so original when she’s just taking other ppl’s unreleased songs and changing her color pallete. It’s not even just the song Karma that she’s claiming she wrote, there’s a clip from a club of her playing a song she said she wrote but actually blatantly stole from a small artist. If you didn’t make it don’t say you did Jojo
Something fucked up about a child star so clearly still being controlled co-opting the aesthetic of child stars who's "psycho" phases were actual struggles against their representation, at least to some extent within their power.
I don't comment often but its giving   " I was 15 Running up and down the block "
I want to start a new genre :lists a numer of already existing songs:
if she listend to creep-P she would explode
all publicity is good publicity. you guys are helping her out is all
The warning that video she put was so embarrassing
12:56 if I had a wish, "I never woulda met her" is what I hear/want the lyrics to be too!!!!
She should work with Jungle or half-alive for some truly good choreography
Comment for algorithm
Idk, I think this promotion is stellar. The video has 20 million views already. Also, she is literally everywhere now. When before she was just in the fringes of fame mostly known for her traction alopecia.
i can't stop saying "DREAM GUEST ON MY PODCAST?!!"
Chad Chad uploads a 2 minute video every 3 years
chadchad will you be my prom date
She just looks like a child’s tv show villain and not even a good one
The fire ball throw was *chefs kiss* perfect 😅
For almost two years now I’ve been looking at the painting on the ground and thinking it’s In Space with Markiplier merch
Idk to me this is a crazy change for her especially in her eyes bc she had to stay kid friendly til she was how old? I feel like the internet is so mean to her for no reason , she was a kid surrounded by adults looking to use and exploit her
You remember that episode of Hannah Montana where she met the pop star Isis, who gave her the advice that she needed to switch up her image to stay relevant, and so Miley freaked out and tried to adopt a fake metal imagine that didn’t suit her at all?  No reason.
Think of all the wasted resources that went into making this disgustingly derivative music. What square is this on the "baby-faced star - turned rebel" bingo card?  How disappointing.
I would much rather watch you dance
I have a sloth teddy that looks just like yours, SO CUTE.
10:26 Stop that blasphemy.
Chadx2 you are amazing, btw.
I feel bad for her because she's gonna look back at herself in twenty years and be full of regret.
Chad Chad can dance! And bend.
I see this as a “gen z version of Miley’s transition”.  Like as an adult I can understand she’s growing up and evolving which I respect but as someone who knows she had a HUGE kid audience even as an adult it’s a bit risky. I wish her luck on finding her audience and maybe check out her new stuff. Whatever makes Jojo happy
it’s not scary to do smth like this, it was scary for ppl like miley cyrus, who got so much hate- and now (after YEARS) ppl are seeing how real she was for that.   but to try and make that happen again, is not scary- it’s seeing something that worked and doing the same exact thing lol- there’s no unknown to it- it’s fully expecting a positive reaction  anyway it’s just cringey but as someone said being cringey isn’t a crime
she stole the song from somebody
Jojo have you learned nothing!??
CHADCHAD POSTED 😝😝
They way her song isn't even her song 😭✋
Jojo reference
3:38 - 4:38 ad
HARVEY MY BELOVED!!!!
It’s so bad
Harvey??!
she sounds like shes been a chain smoker for the last 20 years 😭
We're only witnesses to Jojo's bizarre adventure of growing up
More evidence that wealth is wasted on the wealthy.
nothing jojo siwa does will ever top lil naz x stripping on a stripper pole down to hell and giving satan a lap dance
DUDE THE TF2 MUSIC UTTERLY JUMPSCARED ME- (5:14)
that music video felt a little bit like it was trying to model itself after montero
Chad Chad is Kora confirmed
5:20 i guess dove cameron has LEFT the chat
"Strong language" = effed around
Jojo was just trying to make makeup Asbestos she can
i regret watching this video, legitimately. this is one of the cringiest things i have ever seen. she's clearly been stunted by her uprbringing and is acting like an 11 year old and she's 20
The final minutes of the video went along for me like i was in hypnosis, seeing everything but unable to react to it until the video ended.
omg you're the new avatar
The music video better just be like.... In a padded cell doing acrobatics while facing the wall Wait so... Her new group is just dance moms 2.. Man
she's doing the fake "edgy" kid thing -_-
Jojo gives me major narc vibes.
Harvey? I mean I respect it, but I would not have guessed Harvey.
this is a DISGUSTING VIDEO full of BAD OPINIONS like ur gonna romance harvey when my girls leah n haley r right there 😭😭
the kiss and smooching harvey comment was the most factual thing in this video
Im not defending or arguing anything in the video. I just wanna point out something chad chad brought up about the performance industry. 12 hour rehearsals are somewhat normal actually, for dance careers 8 hours in practice years is pretty typical if youre going to be successful, rocketts can also work 12 hour shifts. Musical theater tends to involve lengthy hours of practice and sometimes multiple shows a night. Performance industry hours are crazy yeah its unhealthy and why so many performers end up in drugs later on down the line in life because they have so much wear and tear on their bodies a lot of them get sddicted to prescription pain killers for onset health conditions often due to injuries and strains from their career in performance.   Tldr: dance and performance careers will break you.   Thanks to anyone who took the time to read my lengthy and poorly worded comment.
This is just her teenage rebellion + years of trauma happening to a famous young adult
Mom can we have Ashnikko? no we have Ashnikko at home *Ashnikko at home*
She should change her name to JoJoJuggalo4Life
Love how u still didn't change Twitter to X lol
This ain’t a twinge, it’s a full on deluge
i wouldnt bat an eye is jojo got kidnapped but karma slaps
Why jojo look like a supervillain from Henry danger💀😭
Who tf doesn't know who KISS is lmao.
hello ms chad
I just feel so bad for her. Everyone is dogpiling on her right now. Of course she's saying stupid stuff and being cringey, she has been exploited for her entire life. There is absolutely no one who could go through her childhood and be even remotely in touch with reality.
I would always click on chadchad's video out of aaaaall the videos that are on here but i still feel sad that she didnt say that
holy fuck the avatar edit im cryin
yay
No fucking way another harvey fans, there arent many of us but the ones that are, are absolutly awesome.
damn you shouldve waited before making this video, because its come out thaty she didnt even write the song lol
Jojo is actually like mentally ill now istg😭as if all makeup, outfits, style and personality wasnt bad enough, the fact that she didnt even CREATE this song makes it all 100 times worse. She copied literally word for word the whole song from another artist, Britt Smith, who released the song and music video in like 2012 I think. Also, I think the song was originally written for or by Miley Cyrus, which is why the lyrics are the way they are. The whole past "bad girl" thing is wayyy more fitting for Miley's story, but I don't think she wanted to perform it, so it was passed to Britt Smith. (P.S. I may not have all details 100% correct because i've only heard the story from friends and some things on the internet, but I think thats like the basic info about the song's lore)
Thanks for watching Jojo Siwa so I don’t have to. I hope this “rebellion phase” is a precursor to her “getting all the therapy she needs” phase.
OMG I DIDNT KNOW YOU WHERE THE AVATAR
hi chad chad
I feel so blessed and seen and acknowledged to know Chad Chad is a fellow Harvey enjoyer ❤ can’t think of anyone I’d rather have for a Harvey sister wife!
who's jessica siwa its jessalyn 😭😭
This crossover between dance moms and Chad Chad…  now has me convinced that Chad Chad is a secretly escaped child from dance moms who channels their trauma into a quiet, all-knowing personality. and the broken knee(s).
I’ve seen so many of these videos. But this is you, so I’m gonna see this again. ❤
the idea that theyve been rehearsing for TWELVE HOURS on some days makes me feel like they started this project super close to the Deadline and that sounds like hell for all involved and i feel bad for all of her staff and dancers n shit. godspeed for fuckin real
Let’s go she’s entered her mental breakdown era! 😂 She’s such a ‘bad girl’ she made a pop song about being baaaaad!!
0:20 this looks like the band “KISS” rip off, Smooch
what's hilarious is that she didnt even write the track. it's a song from over 10 years ago, first recorded by MILEY CYRUS and then given to brit smith before being scrapped entirely.
loving the alien cake poster!!
Jojo Siwa reminds me of Ava Max after she released Sweet but Psycho. If you remember, Ava Max thought she was as popular as Lady Gaga. Jojo Siwa thinks she is a bigger deal than she actually is. The only reason why she is mainstream popular has to do with the memes made about her in the late 2010s and she was on Dance Moms.
the romancing harvey in stardew valley is soooo unbelievably real
the harvey reference is iconic
She stole the song I know it’s from 2012 but I forgot who it’s by.
NOT HARVEY PLS NOT
I'm gay and Jojo is progressively turning me homophobic
11:31 she is even holding a receipt, pathetic
Whats even better is that this song wasnt even written by her or her team. It was originally meant for Miley Cyrus but miley turned it down furing the disney days pf her career. They gave jojo a song meant for early 2010s
The absence of Jonathan in the Jojo list is infuriating 😤😤😤
Imagine you're trying to make your new persona "I'm grown" and your mom made it for you 🤦🏾‍♀️😂
Love the Alien Cake poster 😍
Bye
me when it has music and video
People like Chad Chad really just wait for someone thats memeable to do something morally questionable so they can make fun of them without feeling morally questionable themselves
omg chad chad also loving harvey from stardew makes me feel so validated for some reason 😭😭 idk why everyone hates on him sm like he’s literally my babygirl
9:50 the avatar reference was comedy gold LMFAO
That outfit is giving Kiss meets ice skater.   Also Harvey?? Pssssh I'm aaaalll about emily lol
the fact that it isn't even her original song yet she's acting like it is is just the icing on the cake
Nah jojo got acoumatized 💀💀💀
Just a massive publicity stunt bc of falling off imo
JoJo looks like KISS from Scooby Doo 😅😂
Please I saw a comment (can't remember from where) asking where cat noir and ladybug are when we need them 💀
My Mom's a nice Lady! 😂😂😂
I’m using this as a replacement for JoJos song so idk about the whole fair use thing now. 😂💀
She looks like an Emo mistletoe I can’t 😭-
Bro the karma music video is weird
I am gonna go and play stardew valley and try to romance Elliott.
Jojo really said: ITS NOT A PHASE MOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YAYYYY MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER KNOWS WHAT MY FAVORITE GAME IS (chad chad. stardew valley.)
5:15 ARCHIMEDES SOUNDTRACK
JoJo and JLo are the same level of delusional 😂 yikes who does she think she is
Chad Chad was correct, I did not last a second inside their mind.   I tried to call for medical attention but I already burst into flames.
The fact that this is before the video
it’s weird how she only seems to have one ‘bad girl’ outfit as it’s seen in the music video and the promotions. is it really your new ‘style’ if you only wear one new thing?
Oof, I had never hear Jojo speak before and euh... I want to go back to who I was before this video.
what the fuck is happening
why is she acting like a powerful girls villain
This my dear future/current parents and guardians, is what can happen when you don't let your children experience the phases of childhood
HARVEY MENTIONED 🗣️‼️
True fact : JoJos  a little dramatic ( no offense JoJo )
Even the dog was tired of Jojo
Honestly I take your version over Jojo Siwas lol
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS LMAO
9:07 hell yeah Harvey gang rise up 🙏
Do you and Funky Frog Bait work together to plan your videos? 😮
"This is the most extreme transition from child star to adult artist" My brain: I CAME IN LIKE A WRECKING BALLLLL
Have you ever heard of McCauley caulking? That was extreme and dramatic
Jojo needs to stop smoking so much she sounds like the embodiment of lung cancer
Miley Cyrus syndrome.
She's KISS ing her bad side.... geddit It really does seem like someone older advised her to dress like Kiss cause they thought that was still a current edgy thing. I feel bad for her watching this video, her mum seems to be a nightmare and she seems to be a nightmare too.
She did not say the MV is where it gets crazy😂😂 she didnt cuss or kiss anyone in the MV...but yeah craaaaaazy😂😂😂 Im a recovering addict who was a drug dealer as a teenager, so hearing bowjo siwa say "i was a bad girl, ive done some bad things" is truly one of the funniest things ive ever heard anyone say🤌🤌😭😭
O MY GOD CHAD CHAD UR GETTING TURNT
Its wild how sexually charged its supposed to be and how UTTERLY SEXLESS it comes off as. The bizarre humping felt like two barbie dolls being smacked against each other.
As a Billie eilish Stan I’m really upset people keep trying to copy it exactly
I freaked as soon as she even mentioned Stardew
I think this is a unique thought,  in the music video JOJOs outfit looks like the outfits eels would be wearing in an ocean musical.
Chad Chad is probably going to get scare from doing this investigation
9:10 Harvey! Out of every bachelor you pick HARVEY!!
Who is joe and what did they see
I’m pretty sure jojo has actually just had that car since before she could even drive I’m pretty sure some popular YouTuber gifted it to her in a video😭
Jojo Siwa: I’m the bad guy….. duh
Are we really going to ignore that ChadChad just admitted to romancing Harvey in Stardew?? Red Flag ngl (/j)
i have actually ignored ever other video of someone talking about jojo because i knew that yours would be the only watchable one. and here i am, watchin it.
The brit smith Version of that karma Song is actually really cool :) jojo siwa made it weird. It's like she took toxic masculinity and made it her signature style with all that awkward dry humping that poor women in her Video.
I didn't know who jojo was, but I already hate her.
so real about harvey🔥🔥🔥
At least we have some entertainment now
cinco noches a la yoyos
Not her acting like she’s inventing gay pop when, even to the most uncultured modern pop fan, literally Lil Nas X and Dove Cameron are right there
She has one of those faces that never matured, her soft facial features make her look like she is not a grown woman just a big pageant kid.
Is this TF2 music at 5:20
I’m very sincere when I say this, but I was so confused when I saw the new JoJo Siwa photos. I had thought she signed a wrestling contract and was debuting her character.
if you or someone you know has seen the karma music video, you may be entitled to financial compensation
Chad Chad (Not really) put so much of her Chadussy into that dance montage she couldn't even do the normal outro xd
jojo dressed like a member of kiss looks like a weird WWE fighter
Lets just stream Karmas A Bitch by Brit Smith instead of JoJos version. Jojo didnt even know who Brit Smith was yet took her song 💀
Idk karma sounds like a gacha life 2018 video 😔 or a glmv
I've made my share of befuddling fashion decisions but I am a tad confused as to why she's decided to start dressing like a character from Mad Max. Very intriguing choice but like, go off I guess
I’d give Jojo a break if she could actually be edgy, but she can’t she hasn’t gone outside yet.
why does she sound like a teenage boy with lung cancer???
She didn’t even write the song… It’s a cover song…
Jojo insisting she’s all grown up and edgy but still censors ‘fucked’ as ‘effed’.
God, the ego on her. She thinks the world is going to implode from the shock and awe of her transforming from someone with a loud, overbearing personality and a superiority complex in a sparkly rainbow jazz dance costume, to someone with a loud, overbearing personality and a superiority complex in a sparkly black jazz dance costume (who sometimes says bitch.😲)  Surely, if she truly thought people were going to be shocked and amazed by the new Jojo, she wouldn't have felt the need to do so much prep beforehand to prime people to feel shock and amazement. If she genuinely believed the change would be that explosively impactful, she would have just let the open-mouthed shock ensue naturally with people's initial reaction when the video dropped,  instead of seeding the expectation of amazement to such a ridiculous and embarrassing degree.
It's giving Descendants
I cannot fathom that she is like in her 20s. She looked maybe 10 in the boomerangs video and you’re telling me she’s not JUST turning 17???? why does she look so fucking young 😭
Chad chad and Rebal d posting on the same day? Thank you lord for the food 😍🙏
This video is a Jojo’s reference
she sounds so full of herself, it's such a turn off lol
We want standing ChadChad
her car is absolutely insane what was she thinking😭🙏
why does anyone care about Jojo? like Legit, she was just some cringe child youtuber who then made cringey shit music, now shes a young adult who still makes kids content and cringy music. Why any adult would pay her any attention is beyond me.
where's the dinosaur??????????? 😡😡😡😡🦖🦖🦖🦖
Gurl said bitch but cany say fuck imagine saying “effed”
The choreography is really so horrible of that song even the dancing championship group I'm in is making fun of it and that means something💀
the dog screaming killed me
You're a Harvey lover!! I knew you had amazing taste
Jojo: It costs 0 dollars to be a nice person! Also Jojo:     Hey btw could you put a pad over your bleeding bellybutton and keep dancing thanks
“No one had a career shift so intense like the one I’m doing now”  2013 Miley Cyrus left the chat
Miley Cyrus Type Beat. She looks like a discount Power Rangers villain in these goofy ah outfits.
jojo's bizzare advuenture
"No one has made this extreme of a switch".  C'mon...  The Kiss aesthetic?  Go full Hellraiser Cenobite or GTFO.
Long time fan here. Your name isn't Chad Chad ? Woah.
She's not taking what other brands have done to transition to an older audience in the least cringe worthy way. I'm sure there's a better way to have done this other than how most every single other child star in history has gone through since the dawn of television. But, I believe, at this point, people who watch these stars like the cringe, and the awkwardness that jojo and other past child star's go through because it's funny I guess? sad, goofy, cringey, it sells. internet has been a thing for a while, i'm sure from the last 20 years most actors, singers etc have looked up how past famous people grew up and what not to do that would make them look bad. I might be reading into this too much, oh well. Thanks for wasting your time reading this comment if you did, leave a like, and subscribe for more dumb comments.
She probably thinks My Chemical Romance is Goth
It’s not her “edgy era” it’s her needs a therapist era cause she had this mindset that she’s doing all this stuff and changing music   She’s not making a new music genre. She said she’s Nanking gay pop  Gay pop is already a thing and has been for forever now   She did not write that sing Miley Cyrus did, it was given to a singer and that singer released it back in 2012  So she should be saying (cover) in her MV cause that’s NOT her song she did not write it
An advert kicked in so i didnt have to hear her music again
her digital footprint is really impressive right now 💀
In defense of the song, she did buy it. Shes owns it. Anyways thats the only defense i have
12:57 you actually put the og song's lyrics the one from like 2012 😂😂😂
Stand user: jojo siwa Stand name: Kids choice awards
Stardew valley is so real
Nobody:...   Jojo: I'm friends with Shane Dawson.  oh my god!!😰
I mean, I feel like she's allowed. She'll probably calm down a lil bit over time.
I just wish Jojo would clear her throat 💔
you know something is up when ive seen clips of her hanging around james charles and inviting colleen ballager (or however u spell it) to stuff (aka 2 predators)   {I also hate how making kid friendly music and what not is seen as lame or stupid.  Whats wrong with making content for kids first of all, and second of all its kinda weird to not have a gradual change (like most other artists that were kid stars at one point) and go from kid friendly to the complete opposite.  ur gonna have problems with ur fans when ur content is no longer suitable for ur fans.}
I’ve started playing stardew valley again and suddenly every video I see has a stardew recerence
It’s even more ridiculous that she didn’t credit the original version which was made by Miley Cyrus which was then rereleased by Brit Smith + Timbaland and now Jojo with absolutely zero credit…😀👍🏽
My friend said it’s like jojo is aggressively telling us she’s a lesbian top. And then he said he wished she went further with it
I don’t think JoJo Siwa‘s dancing practice helped her
The ironic thing is it's not even her song and she is trying to brand it as a new genre 💀
Is Chad Chad the avatar when doing the dance because if so you slayed
It feels like she's trying to do what Miley Cyrus did with Wrecking Ball but...badly, and without knowing what she's doing.
Are you sure she’s not an enemy stand user?
Was that a JoJo reference?
i am truly overjoyed to hear that chad chad is, like myself, a sdv harvey enjoyer
Absolutely not the point of the video, I know, but like... you like Harvey??
Can you please just stop smiling. Jojo listen your mom cannot hurt you anymore.....please take a vacation experience some heartbreak, or anything really, and for the love of god frown please.
Jojo:I was a bagel😭😢💀☠️🩸⛓️🔪 Jojo as a kid:🎀🛍️🧸🎉🎊🪩💎☺️😄
Chad Chad is team Harvey and I'm here for it.
She looks badass IDK lol
Man, I think she took too much inspiration from Gene Simmons.
She is fuckin psycho. But not like she thinks.... on account of the psychosis 😂
Yo I can’t believe she dropped fiddle sticks with no warning
That old Cody and Noel audio at the end 👌
Hang on a minute Sofia the first was played by Sabrina carpenter ?!?!
The audacity of her comparing herself to Miley Cyrus is actually sending me 😂 like Miley’s music was actually GOOD!
She's here to rebel in a manner that appeals to the widest possible audience and has the best merchandising opportunities. Hear her roar and buy the new Jojo Siwa Roar alarm clock!
We need to talk about Brit Smith tho
Unrelated chad chad looks extra pretty this video
CHAD CHAD YOU OFFICIALLY HAVE 69 VIDEOS! LETS CELEBRATE 🎉🎉🎉
Becoming the avatar doing the karma dance 💀💀💀💀💀
erm...  so what you are saying is that JoJo Siwa is NOT that anime people fuss about? ok....
Can't help but feel sorry for Jojo. She's been groomed for years to be a child star she missed out on her emo phase and resulted in horrible music. Can't explain the ick I feel when she's with/around "friends" who just so happened to be child groomers. It's almost as if they keep her around because Jojo had been manipulated by her mother to stay childlike and young. Even this reads as if she had a child tantrum and her mother curated it into a preteen phase Jojo should've already had.
Jojo siwa is like that meme thats like  At first I was like:💓💗💖💖💖🎀🎀✨✨✨ But now I’m like: 👿👿👹👹👺👺😈😈😈☠️💀💀☠️
9:10 I DID NOT EXCPECT THIS (ur so real for that)
She's on that red carpet literally pointing at her own outfit and desperately trying to get people to care.  It's embarrassing.
The way she said a twinge of cringe was not satisfying:( all this edging for nothing
The Bizarre Adventure of JoJo
YOU LIKE HARVEY?? NOOOO 😭😭 sebby for life man 🫶🫶
5:24 his face 😭😭😭😭😭
Wait, when was pop straight?
jojo really thinks she invented pop music for gay people....
she's trying to do what Taylor did with reputation, and it's just not working.
I mean, that's all fun and good, but where the hell is the outro ChadChad? I feel incomplete without being thanked for clicking on your video out of all the videos out there!
She looks like if Kiss wanted to create a girl wrestler 😂😂😂
the "JoJo cutting us off" video sends me every time I see it
For whatever reason I always associated the name Jojo Siwa with Australia.  Yesterday I was shocked to discover she's not Australian.
Why is she holding a penis plushie when she’s a lesbian. Vulva erasure.
do you know funkyfrogbait
That Avatar edit was incredible! I can't stop laughing!
JoJo= Lisa Frank with glitter. New Era goth Lisa Frank. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Don't forget the glitter.
If you dont get the jojo and cat pics framed for real youre a PHONEY CHADCHAD
More people need to blame Jojo's mom tbh. Yes, Jojo is an adult now, but she was thrown into stardom as a young child and like all contestants in Dance Moms, was horribly abused. A shame Jojo became an abuser herself instead of breaking the cycle... This whole story is just sad tbh
She feels like an industry plant
her rebrand shouldve just been a jojo pose and end it there
... her mom is the creatice director 💀. Yeah no wonder why her music video was shit.
Why does it feel like her new career advisor is Shane Dawson?  Edit: That being said, I'm going to try to give Jojo Siwa some grace. She was indoctrinated into a hostile environment and is in many ways a victim as well. Maybe she needs to do this to figure out some things about herself, and maybe she'll realize that she has wronged and hurt people.  AND STOP HANGING OUT WITH SHANE DAWSON!
As a dancer, I don’t understand why she is constantly rehearsing the dance as if she has the biggest performance of her life coming up. It’s a music video, you have unlimited takes to get it right.
5:10 HEAVY TW!!
Oh my god, _this_ is what Brock Baker was parodying the other day? I thought he was taking the piss out of the new _The Crow_ film 🙈
Is this a JoJo reference? Or am I stupid?
1:19 i just choked on my apple - oh my Gosh
This feels like when Barbie does punk rock. Like sure, they're dressed up as Kiss, but it's still Barbie
Shes in her Miley Cirus era. 2 more months and shes gonna pop out her pussy on an IG livestream.
Dancing Chad Chad is my new favorite 🥰😅
I just think it’s so funny how much she hyped it up as being extremely dark and offensive and adult, and then it was just generic Disney Channel pop with black glitter and Gene Simmons makeup.  I feel like she was envisioning this being like Dove Cameron’s change in aesthetic with “boyfriend,” but it just felt like the opening scene of Descendants with more black.
the biggest issue i have with jojo's new song is that by saying she was the "first in the generation", she's low-key discounting all of the women before her who went through the same thing and came out on top. like girl be so fr you wear BOWS. don't say you're the first when olivia rodrigo is RIGHT THERE with much better music and a story too yk?? also the song sucks brit smith did it better.
9:48 Chad Chad goes into the avatar state
I would make fun of you for liking Harvey but I like Shane so I cannot be talking. 💀
I miss the outro a lot....
It’s the stripper pole while we watch tv for me 😅
I've seen so many JoJo videos recently I had a nightmare where she moved into my flat and threatened to destroy me because I wouldn't buy her baking paper
Off topic but every time I heard music from A Hat in Time I went bonkers
This feels like complete narcissism and delusion bc the only person who is excited for Jojos new song is Jojo
Jojo after listening to Katy Perry's "I kissed a girl"
You hinted on it already with Miley, but they all did it, Britney, Christina, etc. They seem to have to go through this, I'm not Disney phase.   I get her image was really clean.   Its been awhile ago, but I remember when she turned 18+  Google says her networth is around $20mil.   Personally, I think all she has to do and what she should have done a long time ago is just play down the little girl image. She can still have more age appropriate clothes, and hair styles that made her look good, look pretty, but grown up.   Her clothing and shoe line were extremely successful.   She should have stayed with that except keep a kids line and add a teens/misses line.   I think she should have grown her social media as well, and every 3 posts do a sponsored deal.   Shell eventually reach a point shes no longer relavent.   Ill use Backstreet Boys as an example. They were on top of the world, 1 of the 2 biggest boybands when boy bands ruled the world. Thats been 15+ uears ago.   They actually still produce music to this day and still do tours.   Are they selling out packed arenas like they did 15 years ago? Probabky not. But its enough that a number of fans still listen to their music, and see them on tours.   They still get to be in the spotlight and make some money.   She could have done the samething. Just grow with the audience, shell never be a popular as she once was. But shes probably turning off all her fans with all this.
State fair face paint is EXACTLY it
Jojo's bizarre adventure now has two meanings to me
Bring back the former twinge of cringe intro!!!!😤😤
wow chad, i thought you were better than this. i don't know much about jojo siwa, but i do know how hard it is to control your image as a female child star entering adulthood. she's just a kid trying to figure herself out, not to mention you yourself said her mom likely has a huge hand in how she's allowed to express herself! exploiting her for cheap laughs is messed up. this wasn't ok.
I don’t know if yoh know this but her song isn’t even original. It’s literally stolen from a few years ago. I think it was an unreleased song or smth
You played Team Fortress 2 music at 5:15 and I thought the TF2 brainrot was kicking in and the hallucinations had started. Felt like dying.
She is about as edgy as an edgy goth 12 year old.
OMG. She is the definition of cringe
Honestly, "You were an accident" definitely sounds like something Abby Lee Miller would say
i too would spend 12 hours smooching harvey from stardew valley
She seems like she's going through her not like other girls teenager phase.
I wouldn't put it past her to have copied Taylor swift's lyrics in her song also called Karma at least a little bit
Chad Chad music video when??? 🔥🔥🔥
Love how, when given a choice to either watch the video or leave the room, your dog chose incarceration.
This is the first video of yours that I watched, and I fucking love the part where you are sing~talking over her music video hahah
SONOCHINO SADAME
girl did NOT invent being gay
JoJo is acting as if she's been living under a rock..
No one:  Absolutely no one: Jojo Sewa: "Y'all aren't ready for me to produce music in a genre that already exists and dress like Great Value Star Child....it's gonna get DARK!"
did not expect the jjba reference
Hold on, let me do my make up before I go to the sex store. Gosh darn i nearly forgot my chains and comical amount of earrings!
09:35 me at 2am dancing to ateez:
Jojo is literally 1 to 1 Daffy from Looney Tunes thinking he invented toilet paper. At best she's a pathetic copy of other artist with no actual vision.
Jojo talking about the music video: This will be so controversial OMG 18++ I am such a bad B i basically invented the word  The music video: Most provoking thing in there are the CO2 emissions of the cruise ship.
Rhanks for introducing me to something i never cared about. So i def sont need to. You have done a service for DINK'S everywhere.
i hate when gay people make bad stuff that's not how it's supposed to be
Really Chad?!?! Harvey the most white wonder bread basic bachelor. 😐
Genius publicity stunt imo, I hate it though
No bc why is she akumatized 😭
Tbh my problem with her isn’t her rebrand; it’s the fact that she has been hanging out and collaborating with known creeps and completely ignoring concerns. She’s clearly been through a lot of pressure as a kid but it feels like she’s not rlly trying to get better idk if that makes sense
Where The Fuck Is CINDY!!!!!!!?????????????????
She’s like the third Paul sibling.
and worst of all, she didn't even write the song ...she only changed one or two lines. The song is catchy, though.
the way that she’s promoting a rebranding with a song called “karma” when that is also the name of the song closing one of the biggest world tours going on right now— (i know the eras tour is on break atm but shhh)
HEY THANK ME SO MUCH FOR PICKING YOUR VIDEO OUT OF ALL THE VIDEOS
how is raycon still a thing?
Finally, I’m up to date on drama!
Hey!!! She didn't say "thaaaaaaaank you so much for wanting "😢😢
NO ONE ! can tell me anything about "big carrer change" Look at Skrilex, that guy had an carrier change (in music Industrie). Everything else is just a joke
Karma isn't even JoJo's own song 💀
The Asbestos you were thinking of came from the makeup kits her team sold that were contaminated with it. Not really Jojo’s fault, it was more her Merch team’s, but still.
this is your best work so far
Should change her name from Jojo to Lulu, for Delulusion.
I'm not that much older than Jojo but I find it so ignorant that she doesn't know who KISS is, famously the stars of 2015's Scooby-Doo! and KISS: Rock and Roll Mystery. That was an integral part of every 2000s kid's childhood smh
Chad Chad looks so good I was getting distracted a little omg
She went from coming back like a boomerang, to coming back like a batarang
This has all the energy of a three year old screaming "watch me do a flip" at their mom and finally busting out the most mid somersault in the history of children.
Didn't she also steal the lyrics almost word for word from a different creator?
Let's be real: this is a full-on Jolt of Cringe
5:20 TF2 MUSIC DETECTED, MEDIC SONG DETECTED, WHAT THE HELL IS A MEDICAL DEGREE RAGHHHH‼️⁉️‼️⁉️‼️⁉️‼️
This might be a bit of a nitpick, but what bothers me is Jojo making it seem like making out with a girl makes her a "bad girl" like it's edgy... to be queer?
Anyone mentioning Brit Smith: it isn’t Brit Smith’s song either. It was written to be a Miley Cyrus song and she rejected it. Brit Smith sang and did a music video and then decided to not release it. Jojo didn’t write Karma but neither did Brit Smith. It’s an extremely common practice in pop to sell songs to artists. The problem is more so Jojo framing herself as being genuine and this is a big thing for her but then not even changing nearly any lyrics to a song that she bought. It isn’t morally wrong, she did not steal the song, but it is disingenuous and annoying
for me she was always that wierd kid that showed up whenever a was trying to google something about JoJos BA lol
I tried to eat while watching the last part…  Bro, I almost died from laughter
Didn’t even blink once calling me out about Harvey, wow
I don't give a shit about JoJo. I'm here for Chad Chad's comedy. That dance sequence was hilarious
I have to wonder why she's doing this, given how well it went for Miley
She's so adorable right now, in her little "rebellious" stage lol. Again I do not follow this girl but it just utterly reminds me of my days as a teen, even though she's 20. It's just cute and she's growing into adulthood, people should leave her be.
The dance is terrible......looks like a bad dance dance revolution level doing a weird fake corey Feldman Micheal Jackson impression dressed like kiss conniption fit. Is she ok?Does she need some  meds?
bruh the MOVES AND THE DEATH

I need another mobile game recommendation, Love & Pies is brilliant but not enough!
Ive been waiting for thissss thank you chad chadd
...... who?
4:53 she can't be serious 😂
Fuck yes, a new Chad Chad
jojo siwa soon gonna announce shes the inventer of humping
"we have KISS at home." KISS at home:
9:09 realest thing ive seen all day
I don't want to see anything about the rebrand of Jojo Siwa but I will if chad chad uploaded a video about it
i wanted to hear 'a twINge of crINge'
No way, irl junkerqueen
The state fair comment was brilliant.......i was thinking Dollar store Gene Simmons
No zoomed in hand wave at the end 😭😭😭
So when’s the Chad Chad music video dropping?
the funniest thing about this whole situation to me is that everything ive learned abt this situation was against my will
the somg is kinda good im glad its not actually her song
i love chAD time! :D
i think she got akunamatized
It seems most Hollywood child stars become major screw looses....😬
As a great enjoyer of hyper-pop, metal and everything jojo trying to do I want to say her sond is dog shit
That Jojo has just been really bizarre lately...
Pretty funny that everyone is surprised that when you force a kid into a box their whole life and use them for money that when they finally have their own say they go to the exact opposite.
Chad Chads version of JoJo’s song is better than the actual song 💀
Got it. She’s emulating a Taylor Swift/Miley Cyrus type rebrand, but less successfully.
Chad Chad makes me happy
Music is dead. There is only gaming.
I know I'm old... but how does that outfit not instantly scream KISS knock off, and you can walk around so unaware?
Also, this isn’t even her song. It’s a cover of Karma by Brit Smith from 2012.
omg chad chad i need to hear more abt your opinions on harvey sdv
Wanting to kiss and smooch Harvey from Stardew for 12 hours is real asf
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO YAY
Hey chadchad i love your videos
I had to look up who this was,ive never heard of her and didnt recognize her or her "music"..........so basically she is honey boo boo's pop star sister?
YAY CHAD CHAD ❤
I have no idea who JoJo is but I appreciate the amount of effort that went into avoiding a copyright strike at the end of your video.
Stop jojo😭😭 what happen to boomorang or candy shop
When Chad Chad said “fiddle sticks” that really ruffled my feathers and made me shiver my timbers 😨
100k views in one hour bro didn’t fall off
Jojo need's help
ChadChad (not really) please don't ever change. The world needs you 😂
Jojo acts like how a teenager thinks an adult behaves
Girlie looks like a villain from the Power Rangers.
She’s at that point of losing her kid fans cuz they grew up, and looks like she won’t be able to get older fans. Her fifteen minutes may be up.
Why everyone says it's siwa's song when it's just a bad cover?
She has a new album coming out she’s already been called out because she has two stolen songs
4:31 model shit
Jojo after staying up past 12 am    *I wahs a bbahh girl*
She is not okay🥰 no but like what is this phase😭😭
Alien Cake!
off topic, but I love you t-shirt! 😁
I love your version of the song so much more
Well.. I kinda expect these kinda things from ex childstars.
eyy tf2 medic musik
jojo wasn’t a bad girl she literally sold sparkly pink bows at walmart
9:11 IM WATCHING THIS VIDEO WHILE ON A DATE WITH HARVEY GET OUT OF MY HEAD
I like Chad Chad's singing and dancing better.  she's SOOO hot!
I had completely forgotten she even existed...
Glad you touched on the xomg group. The amount of stuff that has came out about it is insane. Inabber has a 3hour deep dive just about all the allegations.
"Inventing" gay pop? Has this girl never heard of Hayley Kiyoko? Or Girl in Red? What about Cari Fletcher, Dove Cameron or Reneé Rapp? And those are just the first few sapphic pop singers I can think of off the top of my head that are big at the moment.
the Cody Ko x Noel soundbite lmaoooo
Is just another way attract attention since the kids grow up. Now she is like look i am adult know and this is my real face, i am edgy and i am a bad girl.
This song was originally recorded by Miley Cyrus back in 2012, then another woman recorded it and it was scrapped and never released so it's not even an original JoJo song
12:49 the only thing that went through my mind was crocodile
I dislike the insistence that it's a 18+ only music video and then it's just her dancing with lots of girls, like she has clearly zero queer friends to not be able to see that it's a bad stereotype to imply all queer people/things are inherently hyper sexual and 18+ only, when queer kids exist, also all those rehearsal hours and her dancing is still so bad, why is her head not moving in sync with the rest of her body like the other dancers??
Gotta get em raycon earbuds to listen to jojos new song
STARDEW VALLEY MENTIONED
Every time Chad Chad upload the voices get quieter ^-^
the way she pretends to have a boomerang-😭😭😭😭😭😭
It never ceases to suprise me what the theatre kids think is edgy😂
You are the avatar 😂😂😂 the four elements
There was video, there was music. Can confirm
JOJO WHO? I WAS BORN BEFORE 1960,,SO I DONT UNDERSTAND JOJO. HOWEVER,I LIKE YOUR STYAL.SO I SAID IT. STAY AWESOME CHAD
I feel jojo is trolling, fully self aware and the internet cant tell that
For jojo to not know who KISS is feels criminal . I don’t listen to KISS but even I know who they are
Harvey? really, chadchad? out of all the stardew valley bachelors you chose Harvey?
Very curious about what the Google search trend for “Karma’s a Bitch Brit Smith 2012” looks like right now
WAIT HOLY SHIT THE TF2 MYSIC IN THE BACKGROUND?? (I’m fixated on tf2 rn and I’m currently frothing at the mouth. Thank you Chad Chad /pos)
Jojo took her song form a 2012 song called karma same beat of music and the 99.9% same lyrics
This isn’t even her song - it’s a scrapped Timbaland song 🧍‍♀️
alt jojo sisiwa
I see JoJo is going through the Miley Cyrus experience
Holy sh its Chad Chad v Jo Jo
bro was too traumatized to even do the outro, can't blame her tho
so what's a total change?  pony tail and bright colors to changed pony tail AND dark colors 😎😎😎
its all just a marketing scheme ran on rage bait that's sadly working, everything i know about this song has been through second hand sources and just proves that i need to delete the remaining social media i have
"WARNING: The following is not made for children and may be disturbing, or offensive to some viewers. May contain sexual themes, violence, strong language, traumatic scenarios, and flashing lights."  My mind: *pure agony, absolute horror* The actual footage: :|
Your reboot was much more tolerable. Thank you for your service ChadChad.
U make me smile every single time I watch you your so funny and I love your videos ❤and I saw that you posted and I was sooo happy I’m in the hospital right now and you just made my day Chad Chad ❤
i’ve honestly been waiting for a vid about this bc everyone at school is talking about it
"name so nice you say it twice"  -Moto Moto
Jojo is trying to do the wracking ball as a wrestler. Cuz aint no way she did anything else cuz she looks like a wrestler ordered off of wish
Dang she got lead poisoning from da lead based glitter 🎉😮
I wasn’t thanked for staying all the way to the end 😢 my day is ruined
I'm a simple woman, I see ChadChad(NotReally), I click.
she is  so edgy she cant even say fuck *skull emoji*
Chad Chaddddffddd (not really), become straight (also not really), so I can marry your wonderful personality 😩😩😩
She treats it as this extreme revolutionary change while she looks like a 10 year old in Kiss cosplay
41 min ago
NGL your dancing legitimately looked better than JoJo’s .
the Harvey comment is so real
Chad Chad and Ethan should have a freestyle dance-off fr fr
11:28 .. her pants say ‘it costs zero dollars to be a nice person’ come on jojo, decide on a personalised
it’s not a phase mom🤧
"I am the first of the generation" wow, what a hero. We should all thank her for her sacrifice 😂
Thanks for taking about the allegations - shes totally just rebranding to distract form them
Its giving brittney broski
Honestly, I wouldn't mind if Jojo WAS entering a more edgy, dark phase. She's an adult now, regardless of how her work is viewed, and if she wanted to start writing about more mature or darker themes and experiences I'd be cool with that (as long as she's not also promoting to or influencing her child audience to do something dangerous or hold hurtful values).  This however doesn't feel like an actual move towards more mature content, this seems like a publicity stunt.  I'mma use Miley Cyrus as an example because I'm sure we all remember Wrecking Ball and that period of time. The writing had been on the wall but that was a very clear kinda snap in her career away from country-pop to WRECKING BALL. It left no questions as to what direction she was going in, and while I'm always a little worried when something like that does change because we know mental health is not a top priority in the entertainment industry, she came out the other side gaining popularity and getting to be her authentic self to her fans (presumably, I won't act like I personally know the woman).  This stunt from Jojo feels... forced to say the least. In what direction, I'm not sure. The obvious assumption is that she's faking this "edgy side" just for one album for publicity, then she'll go back to status quo after the hype dies down. The other side could be that she's being held back. I know from personal experience how difficult it can be to learn how to express your wants and needs and boundaries as a young adult, it can be near impossible if you have low self-esteem like me. This isn't to say Jojo siwa has low self-esteem, again I don't know her, but if she did then it might make sense that even though she WANTS to go with more mature music and aesthetics, she doesn't feel like she can stand up to the people around her who are using this as a publicity stunt and are corrupting the image Jojo actual wanted to go for. If the latter is what's happening, I feel really bad for Jojo... Bird in a cage...
5:14 TF2 OST MENTION WHAT THE FUCK IS BAD MUSIC RAHHHHHH
"I want to start a new genre of music" **proceeds to enter a genre that already exists by copying a smaller artist's song**
5:23 TF2 SONG TF2 SONG 👿😂🤓✋🤷😍💀😍✋👹🗣🙋
Chad Chad is the avatar confirmed?
'Pink and Gene Simmons had a baby, gave it up for adoption, then it found out who it's real parents were at age 13' lookin ass.
Jojo Siwa looks like the Great Value version of Alice Cooper’s makeup and KISS wardrobe
“I do. I know what’s happening, nobody else” sounds like a quarter life crisis. She’s getting more delusional the more I watch
Jojo siwa really just forgot any gay pop artist existed huh
Wait why is Chad Chad kinda cracked at dancing
She's becoming so insufferable by the minute. The self obsession, the arrogance, and the delusions of grandeur is too much. It's seeping from her every pore and every facial expression ugh I can't stand it I'm sorry lol
Ahhh
But? I though JojonBenét Ramsey was dead.
She didn’t even write the song like she claims is about her Ex’s 🙄
"I've done some bad things" -JoJo Siwa on running over a family in a Kia Sorento in 2000 and backing back over them
She didn’t even write either song lmao. Karma is a song by Brit smith in 2012 and she literally kids bopped it. Also ‘some of my exs were vain’ or however tf it goes wasn’t hers either. It’s honestly funny how she thinks she’s so cool and new when she didn’t write them to begin with.
The edgiest thing you can do in 2024 is literally just be vanilla & normal and not a drug filled sexed crazed demon.
Aang who???💀
not gonna lie, that mv was so LITT! i was headbanging so hard that my head went back like a boomerang. wouldve enjoyed it more if chadchad was one of the actualy backup dancers tho, smh 😴😧🤗
Jojo IS the bizarre adventure
chadchad singing lose yourself had me dying
5:15 Chad chad tf2 fan confirmed?!
"... freaking dang it..."  🤣
I kind of feel bad for her, she never had a proper childhood and is trying to find herself only  now, at 21 years old, and her concept of what an “adult” really is, is completely messed up, she genuinely thinks adulthood is being a rebel, sexual and loud.
Wtf I have the same shirt as you. wearing it at this very moment...bought it in Antcosti island...what the...
The most offensive part of this pivot from her is how inoffensive it all is.
When she says “bad girl” it’s because she exploits children and doesn’t care if they are literally bleeding out.
I'm gonna be as edgy as Jojo right now.. wait for it... wait for it... POOPPY BUTT!! HAH! I bet you can't handle my edginess.
Im early:p  She had a huge glowdown💀💀💀💀   I miss the old jojo siwa:(   And she literally said  I wAs A bAd gIrL  Shes so cringey now and emo bro💀💀💀💀💀💀
This is the equivalent of sneako trying to act tough...
"WHERES THE HUMPING"  💀CHAD CHAD.
The fact that Chad Chad married Harvey and not Leah in Stardew Valley is honestly surprising to me
I literally never knew her from anything other than stupid bows......she has no talent and she is desperate to try and be relevant Also every content creator doing a video about her is actually doing what she wants  and that's keeping attention on her
I knew it!!!!!!
the song not even being an original song is so funny to me
"I want to start my own music genre" Proceeds to list examples that already exist in this hypothetical genre.
Random take but Jojo siwa wouldn’t survive a SECOND listening to a Blood Command song. Coming from a Blood Command fan
Jojo: Nobody has ever had this dramatic change ever-  Melanie Martinez:🧍‍♀️
It kinda reminds me of when Miley went full on edgy. Except she gave us "Breaking Ball" and JoJo is giving us asbestos.
Quen and Chadchad post about jojo recent weirdness hahahahaha yessss 😂😂😂
Bad girl? More like bad at speaking in a manner that is understandable.
I drew like a dark, fucked up version of JoJo Siwa haha. Just a glimpse into my dark reality. A full stare into my twisted perspective would make most simply go insane lmao
I actually like standing Chad
She looks like D'vorah's wretch skin holy shit
Jojo doing the Miley Curys thing...
let’s not forget that the whole song is plagiarized❤️❤️
btw she didn’t even write Karma. It was someone else’s song and she bought it off of her and changed “messed” to “effed” lmao
Her saying she doesn’t know who Gene Simmons is whilst literally dressed up like him 😭 beyond embarrassing and she thinks she’s so cool 🤦‍♀️ like she even said she “expected” and “loves” everyone’s reactions to the song 💀 girl everyone hated it you didn’t anticipate that plz stop
Your body said TAKE A KNEE
tf Harvey? always thought he was a nerd and gave him bug meat and joja colas
woah im so early
Whaaattt? A former child star is dark, edgy, and gay!? My shock! Someone call the media because there's no prior instance of this ever happening before!
The noise of failure rings louder when you reach the top…
The true shocker in this video is discovering Chad Chad is a Harvey Girl 🥺
Pretty crazy how Jojo's making a whole new genre of music with a song that already exists and was sung by Brit Smith 10 years ago.
No one gets it, Jojo is saying she's "edgy" but this is just a grammatical thing. I think what she's going to surprise us with is "edging" on stage. This isn't really new though either, she's just not been to the right clubs.
1) When you don't care about JoJo Siwa  2) ...but Chad Chad
Not to mention the song is NOT original in the slightest. A rip of another song with barely anything changed
Why does the song's instrumental sound like it belongs in Madness Combat?
harvey from stardew valley exactlyyy
I would rather watch Chad Chad dance like that for hours than spend 10 seconds watching JoJo's music video
The absolute trauma chad chad had to endure watching the music video
JoJo talking about this dark personna just sounds like: "Drew like a dark, fucked up version of JoJo Siwa haha. Just a glimpse into my dark reality. A full stare into my twisted perspective would make most simply go insane lmao"💀
Boomers are stealing childhood crisis from their own kids just to make money now ? Well boy I can't wait to see in what turn of events it'll end.
I dont think the rebrand is the issue, she is just coming across as a bit arrogant. The look is fine.
Dream 🚬 guest 🚬 on 🚬 my 🚬 podcast?
9:46 it's the avatar 😂
THE VIDEO I DIDN'T KNOW I NEEDED
whats been in my head:  cykady na cykladach!
Chad Chad's version is way better than the original
She also apparently stole the song some say from a tiktoker others say from Miley Cyrus’s ghost wrighter idk which is true
1 Hour AGO WTH any ways jojo turned into Queen barb now
Jojo be looking like she's having a stroke when she's trying to dance lmao
She's 100% fake. If she would've came out as asexual it would probably have been more believed .
I will KEEP saying this.  This will be iconic in 10 years  She’s having a dramatic shift to move over to a more mature demographic  Think Miley Cyrus circa 2013-15  She did things that everyone hated and turned on her and look where she is now   Not saying at ALLL that Jojo is similar to Miley Cyrus. It’s the end goal they’re trying to achieve
as a jojo's bizarre adventure fan its extremely entertaining to see people just laying into jojo siwa with the annoying jjba jokes. get her ass, girlies.
The abrupt ending after watching the mv is perfection 😂👌
That song karma doesn’t suit her and it makes no sense 😂
Chad chad song > Jo Jo song
9:09 As someone who married Harvey on Stardew Valley on 3 different save files I felt SEEN-
Chad Chad is d’asbestos 🌈🤍
9:46 only the avatar master of all four elements…..
Chadatar: The Last Cringebender
Lmao 🤣 🤣  the ending. Omg that was the funniest thing ive seen in a while
Guys, hear me out, Jojo is part of the illuminati now and she's in her humiliation era
Not one to start twitter arguments but is she partially implying that she's being a bad girl by doing/being gay?
jojo saying she invented gay pop has to be the biggest joke I have ever heard
One of the worst parts of this public transition to adulthood is her keeping all the sparkles just completely ditch them
Honestly everyone is talking about her bad rebrand. I think the marketing/rebrand is working. It’s also literally a Miley Circus redo… which Britney Spears had done before.
is your version on spotify yet?
Fit looking like the Tron version of Miley Cyrus and no I do not know what that means
So THIS is what Cringe is like in human form? Gotcha
guys. Her new song Karmas a bitch is an exact copy of an unreleased song written by Brit Smith in 2012 like my girlie didn’t even try and change the lyrics. It’s actually the exact same please go listen to it 😭
Jojo = Temu Miley
This girl gives Bully Maguire in Spider-man 3 vibes; has no idea what it means to be a rebel so she's making assumptions based on very little information
5:25  *Miley Cyrus blinking*
You’re welcome for watching your video out of alllllll the videos on here. 👋❤
It’s the way I didn’t even know Olivia Rodrigo was on Bizaardvark…  Why were there so many ppl that ended up blowing up on that show??? 😭😭
Junker Queen from Ali Express be like:
Jojo Siwa's new video is, in fact, one of the videos in the internet.
Omg jojo is so bad now. Shes like wearing black😮. headass
I think i prefer you edited version of the song😅😂
I mean, you made an entire video's worth of free promotion about it so I'd say their strategy worked.
Cringe era. Nothing edgy about it
About as edgy as giving a home schooled kid a Mountain Dew.
I mean, she’s changing for her audience. Her audience has grown up, she can’t just stay the same.
I zoned out while she was talking about raycon and I heard something about ears and falling off and was very concerned for a moment 😂
First time ever hearing about this person.
Why are the outro getting sadder when you say bye
It doesn't get better than Chad Chad, it really doesn't
That red carpet outfit reminds me of the pokemon Obstagoon. Like that was all I could think about
Thats like commercial "pop-punk" for young teens (who think they're very rebellious while still going to church every sundays)
i love you chadchad im so glad you made a video on this
So much talking about being a “bad girl” but the only bad thing she's done so far is pretending that she wrote this song ,when actually she bought the rights to the song Brit Smith recorded in 2012
I love how she’s doing this to be mature and edgy but somehow this is the most immature childish thing I’ve ever seen.
loved Chad Chad attempting the dance.
Jojo definitely paid those TikTokers, let them listen to it, then “make up” lyrics for advertisement
Pls tell me where you got that shirt
Get your lips off Harvey, Chad Chad (if that's even your real name). He's already married TO ME!
You also have to take into consideration that Jojo was groomed by Colleen, that toxic gossip train girl. So I wonder how much of this is Jojo and how much of this is a result of being “friends” with a 30+ yo woman.
Chad chad genuinely one of the funniest people on this platform omg
thats some wwe type suit shit
Cant wait for Chadchad's edgy era.
Dear God we've found the next avatar 😭
Hate crime pop
you can’t say you go wild like no one else after being a Disney kid when there’s Miley who set the standards for it years ago
She sound like demi lovato😬😬😬
Fun fact she didn’t make the song it’s more of a cover of the OG song from Miley Cyrus 💀
i feel sry for the red girl in her music video who was humped like that...she needs therapy
i wish karma has been i my mind. ive been thinking of toxic gossip train
The reason she said “effed around” is because if she said the real word, it would’ve given her a completely different audience and not as many kids would be able to watch it. But then again she didn’t make the song and I don’t know if it was already like that.
For some reason her "Edgy" persona makes her look even younger and more child-like.
no more little hand movement and thanks for choosing her video out of all of them  </3
Least bizarre jojo
She was so innocent but I don’t know what happened to her, maybe about dance’s mom trauma. We need more evidence and information!
Good vid
why is this video very gray?
She hyped this up so hard but home girl didn’t even write the song she bought it like ?? 😭💀
thank you for adding tf2 music to this video chad. it made me very happy
Brooo you was spittin though 🔥🔥🔥 7:07
can we PLS talk abt how she never even wrote the song 😭
Shes like if a golden retriever thought it was a pitbull.  I mean really? "I wasn't ready to call myself a bad girl"? and then censoring herself in the next sentence 😭  Edit: golden retriever with severe behavioral issues to be fair, but my point still stands.
She looks like Gene Simmons
it’s just her. the songs aren’t even that bad but that’s because she stole them
Doggo yawning is crazy!
I loved when you started water bending 😂
Just watched the music video… unless you wanna see Jojo hump backup dancers on a deserted island in the weirdest scenario ever, spare yourself from the horrors I just witnessed 😀
the original song is better
diversity win! the worst person you know is gay!
absolutely convinced that she has no idea what "edgy" is lmao, all of this is just smells like a PR stunt to distract people from the allegations against her and her mom
I just wanted to say I agree with the Harvey from Stardew statement
I have unfortunately watched like 8 of these jojo siwa commentary videos and this is officially a cry for help, I’m starting to think she’s kind of a marketing genius
chad chad's dance broke my mind
I am going to be pretty disappointed if I don't see that picture framed in the next video. xD
taylor did it wayyyyy better
How is she going to break out of her child star era without having a public meltdown after being harassed by the media and paparazzi.
The one minor thing that drives me nuts is her changing the lyric to "effed around" when it originally was "messed around". Using the word "effed" makes you sound like a child, not a 20 smth singing about cheating. Also, the Brit Smith version sounds miles better, but it's also like...very dated. You can TELL it's from the 2010's.
The music video to karma was actually painful to watch
47 minutes!! Also not her talking about “12 hour rehearsals” when she did about 14 hours a day on dance moms 💀
Has she always talked like she’s doing a Jake Paul impression? That’s all I hear when I see these clips
Crazy how Karma and another song aren’t even made/written by Jojo despite saying she did  - Karma is an old song by brit smith - Forgot the other one but she ‘sang’ it in an event, completely taken from a tiktoker called Emelie , word for word, og vocals are even in jojos version LMAO
Jojo Siwa's voice sounds like me when I wake up dehydrated. Drink some water.
Loved the video Chad Chad! Shame i couldnt understand anything from 5:10 onwards however because I went insane :(
learning ChadChad is a Harvey stan was traumatizing to say the least
Were we expecting her to start being good? Were we expecting dance moms to be good people? No. But thanks Chadwick

Isn’t this a cover? I swear I’ve heard this a few years ago
We all have that one friend…
Your copyright free versions of songs are literally always 10/10, would stream on Spotify.
Wow Chad Chad mastering the 4 elements before getting Mortal Kombat spine injury was something I didn't know I needed to see but I'm so happy i did
Only you to make my cinic and cold heart have a laugh
Here early
😊😮😊
It's like when kids go into their tween phase of "omg im gonna say it.. fuck! omg haha im so bad. wait wait, bitch. omg i said it!" and considering her brand was acting like a kid as a tween-teenager, it's honestly not surprising that she's just now going through that phase as an adult. it's very telling when she's wearing her black bedazzled outfit and makeup and her body language is just "omg guys look at me! im wearing BLACK clothes instead of pink??? dont i look like an adult!"
Jump on the bandwagon! It's cool to hate Jojo right now. You can be cool too!
the worst part is i feel like releasing this song at this time to (possibly, probably) cover up the fact that jojo and her mom kindve exploited children for her dance group…has been working?? i feel like it’s distracted people from it…
10:28 I will not stand for this Johnathan erasure
Honestly, nothing has made me laugh as hard as this music video in a long time, so for that, God Bless Jojo.
YES I WAS REALLY HOPING CHADCHAD WOULD MAKE A VID BOUT JOJO’S “NEW” ERA AHHHHH
What I think pisses me off the most is that this even her song.  The song was written and sung by another woman ENTIRELY and was never released, but Jojo stole it.  It’s worse than her rebranding in my opinion.
😮
thou shall not lie  thou shall not cheat  thou shall not get caught
Disney channel K.I.S.S.
I like how she says she’s not “reserved for children anymore” when literally it’s all she ever knows; is being a child star. So what does she do? Well she dresses like a child superhero and poses what she this is an adult using a song that wasn’t made by her. 🤦‍♀️
Disgusting, you kiss Harvey?  What that mustache smell like, truffle oil and pickles?
She’s just trying to be the “TikTok baddie” but she’s just embarrassing her self are you not embarrassed?
8:30 OMGGG A HAT IN TIME MUSIC?? It even plays after she says “Here’s the plan” THE SONG IS NAMED “So, What’s The Plan?” SCREAMING RN
You should do some dance moms content
The only bad thing joko ever did was upload the music video
Jojo really acted like she was releasing something as untamed as WAP, but compared to most music videos today, JoJo's music video is not something to add such a big warning to. Ive seen much more sexual dances in different music videos.  Jojo what you released is not special.
All her brain cells must have been in her hair and when she cut all her hair off she lost them
OK BUT LIKE EVERYONES SAYING SHE GOT AKUMATIZED AND I SEE IT 😭🤚-
Jojo is dora the exploring herself 😭 let her be
i dont really care for all the picking on jojo. i believe she dressed as a little girl for a long time because maybe she felt she had to because of how she was controlled as a child and she didnt want to step out of that and now she is so now its like a cringy 11 year old finding out their gay and going for the stereotype as hard as she can with the walk and the thrusting its just kinda like a kid yknow u gotta have empathy
On some level I understand WHY these "good girls from Disney etc. shows want to reclaim their sexuality after being treated like perfect good kids for so long by being overly sexual on main" things happen, even if I definitely think they should have handled it with a psychologist rather than their record deals. I just don't get why they always INSIST on letting the audience know they fuck now. I did not need to know. No one did.
This song played at my high school yesterday… I’ve never seen a group of teenagers collectively hate something to that extent before
9:25 is peak Chad Chad
12:49 the moto moto meme
Its the way we though she was singing a different language at "Thou shall not lie"
46 minutes late guys, I'm sorry
I knew a girl when I was very young who was in dance moms, she constantly missed school and we barely even saw her. Behind the scenes Jojo probably lacked an education and knowledge of what it means to be an adult
Jojos voice sounds like my creaky floorboards
A “bad girl” would be like a criminal? Is she gonna go on a crime spree? I’d be into tbh
Can’t believe Ramona Flowers has a yt channel
This is how I find out Olivia Rodrigo was on a Disney show first?
As someone who's watched a lot of Dance Moms, JoJo has always seemed very stuck up and self-important. During the show it wasn't a big deal, because lots of kids (especially on competition teams) can come across as stuck up. But now that she's an adult it's become insufferable. It feels like she's just surrounded by yes-men who never give her any constructive criticism or media training. She's never been told "no", and it shows.
I hope Jo’s mom is okay. I haven’t heard anything about her since she started dancing.
it's giving SUCH Sarah Lynn (which was... just intentionally trying to give Miley Cyrus SO-)
Fun fact jojos lyrics aren't even her own 😊
this girl and her mom are literally physically nauseating
9:11 HARVEY MENTIONED, WHAT IS HEALTH INSURANCE
I did see the original jojo mobile years ago and it was definitely identifiable
Are you no longer thankful we clicked on your 🫵🏿(oof) video out of aaaall 👋🏿 the videos that are on here ☹️👉🏿👈🏿 I can change!😩🧎🏿‍♂️
Under an hour!😊  👇🏻
The dog sings like an angel!
she says she "invented" gay pop like freddie mercury, bowie and gaga don't exict
CHAD CHAD IS BACK LIFE IS GOOD AGAIN
Jojo have you learned nothing 🗣️!!!
I DIED WHEN THE ELEMENTS WERE ADDED TO CHADCHAD’S DANCE I CAN’T-
In the words of mf doom “we don’t create music we just manipulate it” jojo you definitely did not invent any genre your a music hipster (and all the other allegations😅) 😂
Jojo Siwa’s New Music Video got me in a concussion 😭
Ok ok conspiracy: she’s purposefully doing a v juvenile and painfully awkward “transition to adulthood” shift so that she can “small bean” her way out of all of her abuse allegations 🧐. Like her friend Miranda Sings. Bc that worked out… well…
It’s only been fifty mins and there’s 1k comments…    Thats probably how many missed calls Jojo has from Abby Lee Miller
help I’ve never been this early to one of chadchad’s videos 😭
I love how you don't give no sh#$ts and just dance dance dance
Chad, did you just airbend a fart?
She is giving off "I'm a weirdo" vibes from Riverdale 😭😭
I absolutely respect her for trying to scare the shit out of any moms who might somehow think to play this new song for their eight year olds at least 👍
the fact that that wasn't jojo writing the song !!! 🙂
Jojo, have you learned NOTHING?!
If the music video had already been filmed, why was she still spending 12 hours a day practicing the dance?
This like some kind of awful trainwrack,you can't look away from it
i didnt know she existed until yesterday.
Her edgy look makes her look like Syndrome in drag 😂
I've been waiting for this one 😭
The choreography looks like avatar the last air bender moves on drugs
Where is the proper good bye Chad Chad 🥺🥺🥺🥺
it's so weird seeing her say stuff like "the old JoJo can't come to the phone right now.. that b*tch is in dreamland" and actually clearly not believe it herself even a little bit. I'd say "she's so fake" but given her upbringing is there any world where she could have come out an authentic human being?
everything in the video was a great point  smooching harvey was just the icing on the cake
I think the tight ass ponytail squished her skull 😭
She's so cringe. She literally looks like she has the face of a 12-year-old in the body of a teenager, I can not stand her. And she doesn't even do anything remotely authentic or interesting.
AHHH IVE BEEN WAITING FIR THIS VID EVER SINCE THE SONG DROPPED!!
1:18 “YOU were an accident!” DAYUMMM 💀
Me when I obsess over trying to marry Harvey
i was waiting for u to make a video about her FINALLY
“It was an accident” “YOU were an accident”
FINALLY
"That had music and video" killed me
I think the boomerang hit jojo too hard..
I can't believe she's in her 20s. She still looks and acts like a child
49 minutes ago!!!
What I don’t get is if she wanted so badly to distance herself from her old persona, why didn’t she at least let her hair down?? I feel like the forehead-exposed tight updo is one of her most recognizable features, so when I see her with it all tightly up while dressed in whatever she wears now, I can’t help but imagine a kid wearing their parent’s clothes or something 🤧🤧
12:44 It's even not that funny but I've coughed my pelvis out laughing
12:01 Missed opportunity for "Let's jo siwa all the fuss is about"
IM SO EARLY
6:25 "What's been in your head the last three days?" Karma's bitch from Brit Smith (2012)
SHES WENT CRAzy
I feel like she didn't get the reaction/shock she wanted when she came out, so she's over hypeing the song/video to try and get that reaction now. In the interview cuts I've seen it seems like she expecting more hype from others, when everyone has already move on.
“babe wake up and watch Chad Chad while I make you breakfast”
HARVEY LOVER YESS It’s been a while since I’ve found another person who likes Harvey
She’s really trying to make us forget about all the crud she’s done
Chad Chad got that down south special shirt lol I fucking love it
46 MINS AGO OMG OMG😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
ok but the thing that blew me away the most here is that chadchad is a Harvey stan....
Idk why but her edgelord look reminds me of Hades in the Descendants movies
Hi
She looks liek a monster energy drink badzazzled
Jojo is the ultimate edge lord
JoJo’s acting quite bizarre.
Why does karma sound like kidz bop😭
I love how shes acting like shes getting some huge reaction on the carpet with the black outfit, but people are just kind of staring 😂
i can't fathom how much times i am going to get compared to jojo siwa's new makeup as a goth
I mean, you can't argue it's not gay
Is it just me who could listen to Chad Chad for 1-3 hours straight?
Omg my baby uploaded ^^
Maybe she shouldn't have come back like a boomerang because I failed to catch it and now it hurts so bad I'm cringing
who is this????
the end of this video is almost as anticlimactic as the song releasing
I'm Earlyyyyyy yeyyyyy
...I forgot she exists.
🔥💧🌱💨 moment 9:45
Meh. I'll pass. I can excuse her lack of Kiss knowledge, but I cannot excuse her lack of a black hair bow.
What a great day to be a lesbian and see lesbianism commodified and used for "shock" value. Again. This feels like a harder version of I Kissed A Girl.
i love harvey too he’s great
i knew so many milliseconds ahead of time that you were gonna say jo mama. What does that say about me.
I love how the Cody and Noel screaming eww has become a sound effect
stardew mentioned
It's giving Kiss groupie.  All I know about her is that she played in my town and I worked in an ice cream shop near the venue and we were overrun by smoll sparkly creatures who left a wake of cotton candy body spray and giant bows behind
She went from kiddie core to PG sex demon. That is pretty different.
5:15 Chad Chad though she could sneak in the TF2 song and we wouldn’t notice
btw while jojo and her mom were horrible to that child we need to also talk about her mom not getting her child out of a potentially abusive situation
Me here with my ear plugs trying to ignore my three kids fighting upstairs when you introduce the sponsor! 😂😂😂
WHAT ABOUT SEBASTIAN FROM STARDEW VALLEY HES ALSO SILLY 😭
JOJO, DID YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID ?? YOU DESTROYED SOMEONE KNEE AT 9:57. YOU MONSTER
glad you brought up the actual allegations they're trying to deflect from lol
It's giving Spirit Halloween Gene Simmons costume
I can't believe she compared that sing to APPLAUSE BY LADY GAGA. that's wild
2chad✖️2video✖️2week🟰2Chad^2➕(-2Jo) quick maffs
Lol you just gave her free clout
ITS 5am rn
shout out jjba
my ears are also almost as sensitive as my heart. thank you for the representation chad
Gay pop has been around a long time. Chad, I love your shirt.
I don't understand how this is even a rebrand. It's pop to pop. If I were Jojo I'd get weird with it. Drop an experimental track like Call any Vegetable by Frank Zappa. Or make like a parody Hardcore album like Austrian Death Machine. Really shake em up. If Jojo pulled out Death Metal inspired vocals we'd actually be suprised and really blown away
Am I the only on that feels bad for JoJo? Being a public figure as a child does some shit to you, just look at Britney Spears. And considering she was on Dance Moms, it’s safe to say her mother cares more about her getting famous then her daughter’s wellbeing.  She needs to, at least for some time, get out of the public sphere and talk to a physicist. She needs some time to be a normal person and ask herself if this is a life she really wants.
Guys new epic rap battle gon come out it is karma a b1#ch sans vs karma a bitch jojo siwa who wins
unrelated, but I love your shirt
She didnt come back like a boomerang
No one in their “bad girl” era actually says they are in it. They just do it lmao
Frickity frack, this floopin  hoogalin is acting like a 15 year old whomst is trying to act like an adult but has a very immature idea of how adults actually behave and what they do and their priorities.  Being an actual adult is being able to get tattoos, drinking, having access to adult-only activities and places yet being wise enough to realize you don't need to do those things, better yet, knowing that those things don't bring your life any value in fact they destroy your health and reputation, which are two things that are actually important and valuable to smart adults that have learned to have better perspective.      That being said, Penis warts.
I still don't know who Jojo is. If she has no clue, how could I?
guys. shift your attention from the cringey song to something really important. she perpetuated dance moms' abuse. and all the cringe is just a cover up
HARVEY
thinking she invented gay pop is wild bro 💀 such a punch in the gut to freddie mercury, elton john, george michael, lady gaga, david bowie, etc.
i've already watched like 10 videos about all this but it's just so entertaining
I thought you are KallmeKris in the thumbnail (please take it as compliment )
While we're on this subject, I want to adress the huge lesbophobia that surrounds the JoJo controversies. She has been out as pansexual, yet everytime a wlw is annoying/cringy/problematic she is automatically called a lesbian. I've seen so many people call her a lesbian. She's not a lesbian, last time she came out as pansexual. It sucks seeing fellow queer people (and ESPECIALLY other wlw) participate in those lesbophobic stereotypes of "lesbians mean and scary and annoying and obnoxious". And the reverse happens a lot as well, everytime a lesbian is nice and people love her? She's automatically called ANYTHING but a lesbian.
All these different videos from different channels about JoJo Siwa's recent shenanigans are absolutely hilarious!
I'm late by 40 minutes, but I'm here, our glorious Chad queen ❤
Your shirt reminds me of buck hunter in the arcades back in the day... its dope
9:45 chad chad is the avatar I knew it
sitting chad chad makes deeply uncomfortable.
So it did have music AND video? :O Mindblowing! This has never been done before!
JOJO HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING
She had the audacity to say shes making " gay pop " after just buying and using brit smiths song 💀😭
She looks like a shock rocker like Gene Simmons/Kissk, maybe death makeup of black and death metal... but then it's just bland pop declaring "I'm a bad girl". Oof. Just fucking start doing blow, date someone questionable, get pulled over for swerving and get out of a DUI only to get another in a couple weeks, ice out your mom... You have rebellious options instead of just looking like a rejected audition  for the band GWAR, or a heel in an amateur wrestling match. She's kind of a douche, and I kind of think she could use to "rebel" by getting some therapy.
it's giving "Im not a kid anymore MOM.  Im twelve and a half, im a TWEEN!"
she is trying so hard 😭 she aimed for Miley Cyrus and hit Ellen DeGenerate
no way 38 min ago
She makes me itch :/
She should’ve done this as Draco it would’ve ate
"KARMA'S A FISH, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, IF I HAD A WISH I WOULD HAVE NEVER SWAM AROUND"  🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
jojos dance looks like my 5 year old sister after eating too much sugar
Jojo trying to make us all forget about her past with her new "bad girl" apperance but just embarrasing herself is so funny 💀
I miss your sign off - I watched this video out of allll the videos on here 😢
Hell nah
i’ve been waiting for youuuu😩
chad chad’s version of this song is the only one that hasn’t made me want to rip my ears off
I already know too much jojo lore, but I just love to be a hater so I'm watching anyways
I'm not getting my mom RayCons, Chad.
what the glorp
i stand by chad chad's version being the only way to view this music video
She's dressed like if a dropped KISS member became a professional wrestler. And not even in a good way
I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE I'M BEING SPOILED THE END OF STARDEW VALLEY GOD CHAD CHAD WTF
"her new look is literally just her old one with the saturation turned down"
“Is to kiss Harvey from Stardew Valley” SAME. LITERALLY SAME. MY HUSBAND.
FRICK JOJO SIWA LETS KISS HARVEY FROM STARDEW VALLEY FOR 12 HOURS INSTEAD 🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝
The fact she actually believes that she is the one to make "gay pop" is so funny to me, all she is doing is literally following in the same footprints as Miley Cyrus when she did "wrecking ball"
I'm surprised you didn't bring up the fact that this isn't even her song and was written for in 2011 miley cyrus, and britt smith performed the song and a video but it never got released way back in 2012.
jo jo seaweed 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
this is what happens when you let a child super star into the real world
At first, I thought this was a little weird, but then I realised I don't really care.
The "what if you said 'bitch'" really got me. My ma said she couldn't believe Taylor has songs where she says "fuck" after watching the Eras Tour movie. 🤣
“I was a bad girl, I did some bad things😈” Literally her entire childhood: 💕🌸🌈🦄☮️💝🍬🎀🩰☀️💃🌷💐✨🩷
If my grandma saw jojo siwa before and after the rebrand it would kill her either way
Who is jojo siwa
wake up babe new chad chad video dropped
Jojo's Cringe Adventures
I feel like the reason core why this sucks so much ass is bc being edgy and punk requires raging against the machine, and that’s pretty hard when you ARE the machine
There's only room for one person with the same name repeated twice and Chad Chad is coming out on top
Jojo is the female version of Jake Paul
Welcome back1!!
omg so true btw that song isn't even original lmao the actual one is from Brit Smith
It's giving... Descendants if Cruella Deville had a child with a bat.
Chad chad being a Harvey enjoyer just makes so much sense 🤌🏻 a woman with taste
Here before 1 hr ↓
This is just another lolcow and people are delusional  to this otherwise
JOOOOOOOOJO
I-
That raycon ad capitalizing on mother's day is genius.
the funniest part of it all is the warnings acting like her content is now straight up illegal, but no it’s just some glorified edgy nonsense
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Jojo did not come back like a boomerang 😔
Am I crazy or was that scream at 10:33 from destiny 2? Sounds like Nezarec in his final stand. I KNOW WHAT GRASS IS!
babe wake up chad chad posted
Wait wait wait… HARVEY IS YOUR TYPE?!??! Shocking… absolutely shocking
fun fact! jojo did not write this song, its a unrealsed song made by brit smith in 2012. you hear that? she didn't even write it.
Under one hour gang love you so much Chad Chad!❤             👇
I’m scared of Jojo 😔😰😰
This is just a skill issue, we’ll fix it in the next patch
her choreagraphy is better than jojo's tell me otherwise
Legit had no idea she was even still a thing, I thought she was a 5 minute fad for kids.
You unironically dance better than jojo lol
I waited, I waited, I waited for that JoJo reference, and then I got it. Yes.
Just so people know, she *bought* the song from the other artist, not stole. A lot people are claiming she stole it because she's claming that she wrote it herself, lmao. And claming it's gay pop is crazy when the OG song is about a women confessing to a priest for cheating on her boyfriend 😂😂
state fair lmao
A moment of appreciation for chad chad’s knees
Now I can't tell the difference between "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure(the anime) and "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. 💀💀💀
Happy belated Chadx2 🎉
My friend group once had a joke where our god was Jojo Siwa but after the new song she’s still our God but we’re considering Penguinese (worshiping Gloria from Happy Feet)
HARVEY?!? HARVEY?
Honestly this is GOOD rebranding, not in the sense it's good to enjoy but good as in she's in the spotlight of the Internet again. Because tbh I haven't though of JoJo in YEARS and now she's all over my TikTok fyp LMAO
the fact that she copied the lyrics from Brit smith is so fucking funny to me
CHAD CHAD IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONEEEEE
Jojo really puts the "bad" in "her career"❤️
"No one has even questioned the music video yet"  You know what she was right, it was when I watched the mv when I stated questioning all my life decisions
Tbh jojo did do bad things exploiting and abusing children with her mother but we all know that’s not what she’s referring to
S3xu@l music videos always feel so exploitative. Like i know the performers signed up for it knowing what they were getting into (presumably) but ofc they're gonna have a hard time turning down being in a massive video that could potentially be life changing for their career, even if they don't like what they have to do in the video. Idk just feels gross. And is indicative of the industry as a whole, ofc.
Not the Archimedes from the tf2 soundtrack???
So glad you brought up gene simmons because that was all I could think of lol
Cant believe I just got spoiled the 10 heart event with harvey I was so close to reaching it. It's okay the joke was funny
hey 😮
CHAD IS THIS REAL?
Does jojo think shes rhe first and only lesbian?... honestly i wouldnt be surprised cuz shes lied and dtope so many other things maybe she really is trying to claim shes the only gay person
She did not reach the audience she wanted to
I mean, this all feels very, very "sheltered young person has their first relationship and their first big breakup" to me.
Fun fact: the age difference between Chad Chad and Jojo Siwa is the same between me and my older brother
the original version of the song makes much more sense and sounds way better 😭😭😭
YES HARVEY SUPREMACY
Her whole brand is giving that 2021 Cinderella movie with how she's claiming to be the first to be doing something when she very much wasn't and causing public disturbances as a way to promote it. Maybe disturbances isn't the right word but public annoyances maybe. Also when I say "whole brand" I mean her current brand with her new "era" or whatever, not her brand in general past and present but then again maybe that's valid as well.
She was never a bad girl lmao
Chad Chad idk if you got a new monitor or got an editor or something but the color grading of your footage is mega dull and gray :(
jojo pretending to write a new genre when she didn’t even write karma
lmao the bending. We need an entire series dedicated to chadchad doing random tiktok dances better than the original
jojo is going through that “child star to adult” phase like what happened to Miley and Lindsay but she’s trying so hard to milk it for money that it’s not understandable it’s horrific and scares me quite a lot actually
thanks Chad Chad for sacrifice for us, so we dont need to see this Cringe in full glory
When she talks she enunciates her words in a way where it sounds like she's about to sneeze everytime she says something
A lot of people were saying the song and just the whole situation was similar to a kid saying a bad word for the first time and I 100% agree.
I’m way too early…
what the fuck is a "jojo siwa"
Yes! A fellow Harvey enjoyer 😭
I think being a child star didn’t do Siwa’s mental health much good.
JOJO REFERENCE??? 😭
9:07 ur so real for that
“I was a bad girl” hun u were a bow girl
She is no longer girly pop 😔💀
she didn’t even write it
Jojo stole Gene Simmons’s (the weird bat guy from KISS) makeup
she’s having an identity crisis
girl the outfit…
The fact that funky frog bait did a video about that too yesterday shows how much her marketing worked 💀
Chad is sigma alpha gamer sussy imposter skibidi toilet ohio grimace shake.
Walking backwards on a treadmill for 5-10 minutes and doing tibialis raises can help with knee pain.
mama, kudos for uploading, for feeding the children
I’m so embarrassed for her. She should really stop thinking so much about image and think about who she actually wants to be—if it comes from the heart, the image will follow. People need to focus more on being genuine instead of just trying to get people to talk about them. I don’t really know anything about her, but it seems like her mom really did a number on her.
jojo isn’t even singing or dancing well like how are you gonna do both bad like…
“JOJO HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING”
jo jo isnt 🥰💕💖 she’s… 🖤⛓️🔪
DID YOU KNOW THIS SONG WAS ACTUALLY BOUGHT? it wasn't even originally made by her 😭
i used to want to be on dance mom SO BAD as a kid. 10 years later, i am so glad that i was not one of the poor kids abby got her grubby little paws on
Ok, real talk.......can we get more videos of Bones?
Wait, Harvey, of all the NPCs?
The fact that the song is originally an unreleased song by another artist from 2012 or smth 💀
newwwwwwwww chad chad, its been forever
Is she a cyber punk juggalo?
Jojo definitely did NOT come back like a boomerang, that’s for sure…
Lmao youtube gave me a pop up on this video "up next, Jojos bizarre retrospective" and I thought it was pert of the video.
Nevermind, go back to selling bows 😭😭😭
“I was a bad girl-“ Stop… just stop
I love watching my favorite youtubers when i'm dying of a cold
Another thing a lot of people aren’t talking about is the 2012 karma, I forgot who it was released by but you can probably find it on yt. Jojo either bought the song and just kind of re did it a bit, or just stole it. No it’s not a coincidence, the lyrics are the exact same 😀(I think)
Rip raycon for having to be put in this video of all videos💔
i also spend an ungodly amount of time smooching Harvey from stardew valley
I was just hoping today you would post a video about this🙏
She's turning into the Unknown from the Willy Wonka experience
The fact that she didn’t even write it, apparently she took this unreleased song and said it was hers
8:13 it's giving before shower make up 💀
i barely knew jojo siwa outside of her intruding on searches for jojo's bizarre adventure so seeing other ppl discovering jojo's bizarre adventure for the first time because of her is funny to me <3
The best part is the Karma song is stolen from another artist 💀
Chad didn't thank us for watching her video out of all the videos that are out there. How will I know she appreciates it.
Didn’t even have to mention she straight up stole parts of the song to level her
auto cringe cow
Of course she doesn't know who gene is, miley cyrus is her type of "rock" 😂
MUAHHAHA:🗿🗿😈😈
chad chad edgy era when
She is literally the same person but going through the edgy  phase she missed out on 10 years earlier. The lack of interaction from people her age has left her to act this way late
Her dance video looks like shes having a stroke.... 😢
Isnt the karma song like just a dtunt to distract from her controversy
the minute i heard ab jojo’s rebrand i thought “i can’t wait for chad chad to talk ab this”
9:12 best boy mention
HARVEY ???????????????????????????????????? cmon chadchad u gotta have better taste than that.....
guys im starting to think that she might not be chad chad really…
its 5 am rn D:
This is what happens when you don't "rebel" when you're younger. You become this.
See this make me sad. I cannot say I like jojo song bc people will thinks of this while I’m actually talking about boomerang that had a grip of me as a kids. And god dammit it still good
It’s bc the only people who would think all this terrible rebrand is “edgy and bad” is young tweens like 12-13 yr olds like wtf are u doing
Y’all are so oblivious it’s clear she unlocked her stand ability
Chad Chad is the Avatar  confirmed
Did JoJo get akumatized and we didn'tt know until recently ?
The abrupt bye at the end is very chad chad of you
*i was a bad girl i did some bad things*    jojo siwa 8 years ago-🌼🌞✨♥🏳‍🌈
GOT HERE 22 MINUTES AFTER POST BC I WAS JUST WATCHING YOUR VIDSSSSS HEHEHHEBEBJNBRF CDUHBF
Chad please no joe mama jokes. you are better than this.
Wait I'm early hey gays
All that horrible unforgivable mistreatment, abuse, and financial frauding, aside.... her hail mary with the rebranding (distraction)  is falling flat regardless if she ignores her victims or not. and its all because she cant pull off "bad girl" when she has perpetual horse girl face.
This isn't even her song 😭 she stole lyrics and everything from some other girl's song from the 2000s
Best part of the video was how in the middle of the crazy dancing they kept showing shots of a completely silent cruise ship
Ive started this video 10 times now i cant concentrate theres just so much to see and unsee
The abuse and the lies and the plagiarism is all awful. No matter if you like the song or her new era or not, the things she's done lately are awful. And her saying she wanted to have her Miley Cyrus moment while simultaneously copying a song she wrote 13 years ago is crazy. Absolutely wild Jojo. Just wild.
the "EW WHAT THE FUCK" soundbite killed me i am currently dead on the floor thank you chad not chad
You'd think for being a part of Dance Moms, she'd have a better grasp on making a new dance. I guess there's a reason they didn't call it Dance Daughters
“Im a big kid now.” (Pampers commercial)
So fun fact, the song karma, was in fact a word for word copy of a Britt smith song, by the same name. The only word she changed was “messed up” to “effed up” which kind of fits her whole “oooh look at me I’m so edgy” theme
Gosos wenrjdhdbs d tbtbebjduhdbr rnsldj thabk u dat swas me jujo impesitoin
The recent drama around JoJo Siwa on TikTok has me thinking a lot about what happened with Noah and TikTok in general more lately. Disclaimer, I have no feelings at all about JoJo. Don't know much about her other than she's been all over my socials the past few weeks due to this new song and music video she recently put out.  Today the drama revolves around the original "Karma" song and music video, written and performed by Brit Smith, getting posted online. This has led to TikTok going to war with JoJo Siwa, claiming she lied about writing the song. That she stole the song, etc.  The problem? She didn't do either of those things. She never claimed to be "scared while writing" Karma. She explicitly said she was scared of Karma—because its lyrics were outside her usual brand. She also didn't steal the song. She bought it legitimately as a lot of people in the music industry do.  But those two facts have gone ignored on TikTok, because the facts aren't as funny or scandalous as the memes and rage bait people can generate.  Then of course, when JoJo posts a video obviously upset and crying about the hate she's gotten online today, those same people lambast her over being a rich woman crying in her expensive car.  Ring any bells?  Noah Schnapp has been driven off of social media at this point. Years of TikToks have been privated, his YouTube has gone quiet, and he's even taken down most of his Instagram. All in response to hate he got from some bad internet actors who took a strongly-worded post in support of Israeli hostages AND innocent Palestinians and turned it into a claim that he supported the wholesale genocide of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.  Just like JoJo, people invented stories because obviously what he actually said wasn't spicy enough for virality. They claimed he laughed at dead Palestinian children. Ask them to show you where he did this, though, and they'll show you a picture of him smiling while people WHO ARE NOT HIM in the background have "Zionism is sexy" stickers on or in their hands — which is not the same thing. Not even close. They've lied and said he harasses people of color on the set of Stranger Things. Every report we have from people who work with him, though, says he's a sweetheart.  See the trend?  I am begging anyone who has managed to read this far to stop using TikTok as a news source. Like any video app, every single person who posts on it has a slant, a bias, a narrative, an agenda. For most, they just want attention, likes, and views and they know what trends — baseless rage, memes, and cruelty in the name of fun. Many of them like to dress up as activists fighting for the little guy, while they themselves are wealthy creators who are doing absolutely nothing to solve the problems they claim to care about.  Defend anyone they rage against and you're just "defending rich people." Trust me. You're not doing the working class any favors by being vicious c***s online. You're not "taking on the rich" by lying blatantly and making your lies go viral. You're just a terrible person with selfish intentions. Be better than that.
kiss from dollar tree
thank you for ALSO reminding everyone about the ab*sing her dance team part, people keep leaving that out and it's like wait she actually is a bad girl she's literally a terrible person
Yippee, I'm here early. I love the content. Keep it up ❤
Her new song sounds like she just learned to swear
Jojo has been a litte ... quirky? these days.
Girl u so pretty I want to wrap my car with our Face ahaha
honestly her outfit is basically just the same as her old style just in black and silver, I feel like it'd be better if: a.) she stopped trying to have the sex appeal b.) the rhinestones were black not silver (idk personal preference or smth)

Chad Chad's choreo is unironically better than the official one 😭
JoJo see what?
JoJo’s edgy era? So… season 3 Joestar?
I hope for her sake her transition into adulthood goes okay. Seems like a tricky time in life to be famous
I learned in college what you guys call ''era'' as being another topic in the DSM lol
she's the kind of person to say she's doing drugs when she's taking tylenol and melatonin
When your definition of being rebellious is wearing a Gene Simmons halloween costume, but you don't even know who he is.
so everyone's postin their videos about jojo siwa today huh
just got the notif, you know it's a good day when chad chad posts
YES!!! HARVEY IS SUCH A CUTE GUY, WHY IS EVERYBODY SAYING HE'S WEIRD? HE LITERALLY ORGANIZED A RIDE IN A HOT AIR BALLOON TO CONFESS HIS LOVE!!!
Jojo Siwa turning into a dollar store Kiss to distract us from the terrible shit she and her mother's done, like let's go Smooch cover up your crimes! lmfao
2.5k views in 20 minuts, dann chad realy fell off
My brain 24/7 is a mix of Murder drones theories, GHOST music, and the song Funky Town, this I believe would drive a man insane.
You know why she wasn't ready to say the lyrics to "her" song? Because they weren't her lyrics.
stop making me cackle
FINALLY A YOUTUBER I WATCH TALKING ABOUT HER I WAS TOO LAZY TO LOOK AT IT MYSELF
Was that a sample from Porcelain Black (formerly Porcelain and the Tramps)?
“It’s not a phase mom!”
5:27  OLIVA RODRIGO WAS IN BIZAARDVARK?!
1:36 yes chad chad, thats what artists normally do when they make music.....they promote it!
Yeah
Funny thing is she didnt even write the song like she claims, the song was already written by other people including miley cirus😭
I thought she was going into a WWE event in that outfit.
Sitting Chad makes me deeply uncomfortable
Her industry plant handlers should prolly tone down her cocaine only diet. 😂
HARVEY????????
Chad chad not you too, you're also hopping on the hate train!?🤦‍♀
9.30 Chad Chad posted two videos of jojo dancing next to eachother like we wouldnt notice🤦‍♀️
the minecraft skeleton noise when you fell over had me DEAD i genuinely had to pause the video (my humour is broken, its a fucking sound effect lol)
I have seen the video of JoJo coming out of the water cut away to Motto Motto and I can't unsee it
Gurl Harvey? He is such a cheapskate xD
Oh child stardom and it's tendency to destroy people mentally.
Chad Chad = best takes
MAKE LONGER VIDEOS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
I thought you were gonna mention how she was hyping up this song and saying she created a new genre, but it's just a cover of a 12 year old song she bought off somebody😭
Just when I thought I was done with commentary on JoJo Siwa, this video dropped and I was like, hell yes
She went from 'Jojo' to NO JO , NO PLEASE! 😭
I appreciate all of us are mildly concerned about her
my favourite part is how much credit she is giving herself for the lyrics when she didn't even write it
maybe jojo can use all that music money to buy some rogain
YESSSS THEY FINALLY COVERED IT LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
you too chad chad? the OTHER double name gal with crazy eyeliner? :p
I skipped the ad (sorry) and saw Chad in an armpit, I’m concerned.
Literally using my raycon everyday earbuds to watch this lol.
I was waiting for this🥳🥳
Just one question: Who is JoJoSiwa?
jojo siwa finally hit her emo phase 😶
“the human version of a glowstick”😭
harvey is the worst bachelor hands down
11:22 she better not be comparing herself to Taylor swift.
Someone said it's like when the super religous, sheltered, homeschooled kid drinks Mt Dew for the first time, and I'm like, yep.
omg chad chad is a stardew valley fan AND loves harvey!!!
Jojo is in her “EMO” girl era 😭😭
Erm… what the chad
I know the main point of this video now and I too would love to spend 12h kissing Harvey Stardew Valley
i didnt expect to see dancing chad chad today GFJDGFJH
The edit of no hair other than the ponytail is hilarious 😂
those tight ass side ponies gave that poor girl brain damage. Oh and I'm sure she's got some lead poisoning too.  Also when she says gay pop....I hate to say it but I think she's saying it 90s derogative style...like she means bad and not homosexual. She's seems to be trolling herself as much as her fans.
i love the twinge of cringe has slowly gotten worse and worse
Chad singing karma has made my day
First
She really doesn't deserve the "jojo" in her siwa...😔
NO
"well, that had music and video"
Under one year  👇
yay chad chad
Someone just called me a fanboy😢
im sorry... Harvey???
She just looks like she gonna wrestle me
I was a chad chad (not really)
I think she's js entering that era of when a kid star is trying to be taken seriously or seen as mature

Jojo < ChadChad
i mean her acting like this isn't very surprising and actually very sad because it's most certainly driven by being a famous child and that, historically, doesn't end well for the kids. i already knew that of course but watching "quiet on set" has really made it more obvious in the TV sector, god only knows what goes on elsewhere.  so basically i think she's probably dealing with a lot of shit and it's manifesting like this so godspeed to her and hoping she gets better soon
Jojos candy shop came back expired and gave her explosive diarrhea 🎀
chad chad is the only person who can make something Jojo Siwa related truly enjoyable
It's like she finally snapped and lost her mind.
Jojo is what happens when you assume all criticism is just haters hating
Chad Chad has posted
Petition for chad chad to become a pop dancer  👇
I was waiting for you to cover this 😂
14 mins ago lets gooo
R.i.p old jojo siwa
the boomerang hit her head a little too hard 💀
HELP U HAVENT BEEN IN MY RECOMMENDED IN SO LONG GIRL I MISSED U
9:13 HELP SHES SO REAL FOR THAT
Timestamp 12:45:  *jojo falls*   Her: 😮
I think she's too old to be going through a tween level rebellious phase. If you're going to go edgy, you need to go Miley level.
Girl was looking like an eel in the Karma music video. 💀
I LOVE CHAD CHAD
Its worrying im in the same generation as that woman.
Turns out that kid in a candy store slowly became girl in a drug store
Why she do the Critikal outro 🤣
The most cringe part of it all, it’s not even HER song. It’s a recycled song from 2011-2012, and the original sounds way better.  The weird, glittery KISS makeup… just what. 😂 The whole thing is just try-hard madness.
Youre a harvey gal? Unbelievable. I'm a hater
can you make a video on the facebook marketplace
"wheres the humping i wanna see humping" HAD ME DYING
Every time I see Jojo in the 'edgy' outfit I can't help but think she's about to cut a wrestling promo
All the kids watching her are now grown up and don’t like her contents anymore, so she has to resort to this.
seeing chad chad break dancing is something i never thought i would see.
the medic music healed me
chad chad is the only  🔛🔝
This cured my depression
it's been a bit of an extreme turnaround....
Hi
i dont care how many people do videos of her i will watch every single one
JOJO PLEASE DONT KEEP GOING WITH THIS ISTG
she's so quirky and edgy and badass. YOU GO GIRL✊✊ KARMA IS A B*TCH!!
You know it’s gonna be a good lunch/YouTube duo when chad chad drops a new vid
Chad and Chad - in this economy?
as i saw someone say, jojo is just basically cosplaying an adult at this point because she has no clue how to actually be one
Been looking for this Chad Chad video
It's giving Eleven in Stranger Things season 2
EALY GANG FINALLYYYY  SO HAPPY TO SEE my FAV commentary YOUTUBER finally react to this!
the most insane part is that she didn't even write karma... it's actually an unreleased song named "karma's a bitch" by brit smith
I was a Chad girl, I did some Chad Chad things
i love the pop group JoJo's JoJo JoJo Jojo JoJo JoJo JoJo JoJo JoJo
I find it wierdly cute? Like a child showing their sonic.exe oc, its about ok that level of edgy
Why does the song sound like something that would be in a gacha life music video from 2018
Harvey? HARVEY??? 🤢
428th comment 😍😍😍
the boomerang hit her so hard she grabbed her invisible one
The queen is back (Not Jojo)😍😍
The "Twinge of Cringe" has drastically changed over time and every video.
wake up babe chad chad posted
Her teeth sheer through the dark
Blessed by this on my YouTube, I have been scrolling so aimlessly! Thankyou for saving me 😭
its so funny she thinks she taking such a daring leap. she’s “the first of the generation” SO many disney stars turned to music that children probably wouldn’t listen or understand. i mean sure… olivia hasn’t humped a beach in her mv’s (and i really hope she doesn’t). but as someone who watched a lot of olivia’s stuff as a kid and loves her music now. it’s just something that happens idk. kids grow up (i mean that’s crazy /sar) jojo’s just taking it way overboard tbh 💀💀
"bc it's my last day being a child star" girl has her breaking bad moment on a public calendar.... it's not the moment she thinks it is then, it's NOT a Miley moment please
I see chad new video i click and eat whilst i watch
I'mma be honest.... I only learned that Jojo Siwa was from Dance Moms... Just now.
😁 i say i’m fine, but really on the inside i’m… thinking of asbestos 😞
From denmark and Idk much about this person. I only kinda know her as a friend of coleen ballinger and that's not exactly the best.
Hello everyone
She reminds me of a little kid that stole her moms make-up and drew all over herself with it
It’s so awkward watching her say over and over that this is the biggest jump when everyone can see it’s not. I guess none of us should be surprised, but it certainly is… something. It feels like akin to a child thinking they’re so edgy and different because they dressed up an iconic horror movie slasher instead of a princess for Halloween one year lol.
the music video was basically just jojo humping a woman’s leg
chad chad your dancing is immaculate, showstopping, magnificent, beautiful, amazing, gorgeous and tear-inducing
Jojo is having her Emo phase at the age of like, 25
8:29 a hat in time music 🚨🚨🚨

Chad Chad is on a win streak
9 MINUTES YES I'M EARLY  CHAD CHAD SLAY
HIIII I REALLY NEEDED THIS VIDEO 😭😭😭😭
😭 my child self would have been traumitized
5:23 tf2 music detected, brain deactivated
jojoe mama
I knew it was only a matter of time before you made a video on this 😂😂
shane dawson jumpscare 😢
we stan standing chad chad. everyone else is a hater
no one’s watched this entire video yet…
hi
9:12 the harvey mention is so real 😭
As someone who works with asbestos it misses you too chad ☺️🫶🏽
CHAD CHAD😭😭
I sort of feel bad for Jojo. She wants to change her audience but is doing it in such an awful way.
jojo siwa’s edging era
chad chad
I broke my ankle running in here.
Chad chad, chadding once again. What a chad.
Mommy Chad uploaded.😩
It's a damn earworm & I can't wait for my brain to find it's replacement.
My anxiety and depression is gone because of you Chad Chad
She always grabs her nonexistent croch lmao 😭
Just wanted to say I'm early!!! I bet this will be a great video!!!
Wow Raycon is still kickin? I thought nobody bought those, like ever
my lord and saviour is back
jojo is in her ojoj era
bro left the candy store
Only 7000 views in 7 minutes? Fell off
whenever i see chadchad noticifaction my lifespan extends a few years
dude the car bit was so funny
wow. its almost like... (listen this might be crazy to say) ... she grown up.
Trying SOOOO hard and yet she still somehow feels like the Disney channel version of an edgelord Imaooo it hurts
I think the glitter got into her head which made her become a 'bad girl'
Jojo siwa? I hardly know her
Jojo siwa is trying to hard to be angsty
I genuinely believe this new look is to cover up the damage she did to her hairline with those awful tight ponytails for most of her life. You wanna cover for traction alopecia, Baby Lesbian Gene Simmons isn't the worst cover, I guess.
Why have we left the eversweet twinge of cringe in our past
7 minits
GET UP CHAD CHAD POSTS
Still waiting for the edgy chadchad era, more edges! I'm just excited for this video!!! This joke means nothing!
my cat loves u. every time I put on a chad chad video she comes and watches with me and purrs :)
read the title as "edging era" the brainrot is crazy 😭
Yk it's a good day when Chad Chad post 😼
She didnt invent gay pop 😭
I’m glad you covered this. I’d seen the memes but was too scared to read the articles
3:35 why is this guy such a cute patootie
I accidentally forgot you existed
Was waiting for u to talk abt it , and her mv is creepy asf dude !! 💀
OMG WAS WAITING FOR THIS
OH MY GOD A NEW CHAD CHAD VIDEO YAYY DINNER WILL BE SCRUMPTIOUS
Don’t let them bully you back into the chair! Stand up for your thoughts.
Them bangs work wonders for Chad Chad huh 😏😂
chad chad may not be pregnant, but she always delivers

Before: 🌈 After:🏳️‍🌈
I LOVE U CHAD CHAD
Rhis is so awesome sauce
"the human version of a glowstick" -ChadChad 2024
I was a bad gurl: 🦇🖤🕷💣🕸 Her literally like a year ago: 💅🍭🎀🧸🌸
jojo was a bad girl she did some bad things like um idk she yelled at children.
Jojo Swish or whatever is her name is making this whole rebranding because she is trying to divert attention from fucking up those girls.  Sad that she, who went through trauma, chooses to traumatize other children.
all i can think of is what would abby lee miller think of this?
Jojo siwa ❌   Jo Mama✅
jojo siwa mightve not slayed with her rebrand, but at least every single commentary channel got fed
last time i thought about jojo was when i saw those bows in walmart 😭
Hi, Chad Chad. I'm not sure if you'll see this comment but could you please make a video on Project 2025? It's very scary but spreading awareness about it would be great!
Y’know I think Jojo should take a break 😭 girlie you need a social media cleanse
Jojo siwa is honestly just a victim continuing the cycle of abuse. It's sad.
hey, NOT ChadChad... I love you. Kbye.
OMG 5 MINUTES AGO I LOVE U CHAD CHAD
"it was an accident, you were an accident" Chad & Chad is chaotically wholesome duo
I saw that Jojo mama joke coming and that’s what I am here for baby ✨
Jojo “should’ve known better” than to release this song 💀
Froggy, layze, NOW CHAD CHAD. Now my favorite three drama yters!  0:20 lol 0:27 yesss. 0:45 yes, but that music vid traumatized her. 1:03 yeah lol 1:10 trueee. 1:14 uhhh lol 1:19 BAHAHAHAH
Wake up babe Chad Chad posted ‼️
Chad Chad we all said in unison
that was the most accurate description of dance moms ive ever seen
jo momma
The fact that’s she’s acting like this and didn’t even write the song.. omg
how am I three minutes into this video but it was posted 34 seconds ago. Youtube math
i heart chad chad 😻
"I was a bagorl...😫😈 I did some bad thangs...😈"--Jojo Siwa, Karma, 2024.😨(also, WHAT THINGS JOJO???)
Hello, Chad Chad.
I saw Chad Chad. I click Chad Chad. I like Chad Chad. I sacrifice my soul for Chad Chad.
Me watching this video knowing that the thing that was special in the music video was jojo humping one of the dancers:
Omg I'm early hai
WHEENNN WILL SHE DO TWINGE OF CRINGE PROPERLY WHEENNN
4 minutes new record
3 mins ago‼️‼️
4 minutes ago !? It’s an honor
i love you mesothelioma from asbestos exposure
i feel like it's so dumb that she decided to call her new music "gay pop." like girl you are not the first gay person to sing a song😭😭
i see chad chad posted and i drop everything to watch
HOW IS SHE TWENTY..
0:51 AHHHHH MY EYES
guys i think her name might be chad chad secretly
JoJo's in her gacha life song era        Edit: mom I'm famous
Jojo did you learn NOTHING 😡
Hiiiiii
its like the store justice become a person and jojo siwa was birthed
0:11 i think she just cursed us and all generations of our bloodlines to come
I rewatch every Chad Chad video in hopes she uploads. I’m so happy xxx
I’ve never clicked on a video faster than
That fact that what she and her mom did  to Leigha Sanderson coming out is the only good things that’s come from her new “edgy” era. This isn’t even her song, it’s stolen from Brit smith.
I love her saying shes starting a genre and proceeding to list all the things in that genre
Karmas a bus beep beep
She’s giving sales girl at a drug store 💀
Yassss girl finally the golden content
The Queen had to adress it
I wanna know when she was a "Bad girl" like when😭
Tbh I don’t rly have a problem with the song “Karma” being cringe is not a crime, but the fact that she exploited disabled kids + defended Colleen makes me love it when ppl hate on Jojo.
WAKE UP CHAD CHAD POSTED ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و ♡
It’s scary how jojo just chose this one era-
Girlies get up Chad Chad just posted
She looks like a glitter bomb sent from outer space.
you and funky frog bait are so similar... i love it
my life was good until some asshole named bearded dragon nerd commented "i see chad chad i click." 😡
Where is the "TWIINGE OF CRIINGE" 😭
This is kinda bizarre
2 MINUTES AGO!
If I had only 10% of  Chad Chad's IQ level I would be able to rebuild the Roman Empire
the boomerang came back and gave her a concussion
I came to watch once it had been posted 2 seconds ago!!
KARMAS A BI-I SHOULDVE KNOWN BETTA
Jojo’s just tryna get more attention and money and it’s working incredibly well
IM SO EARLY WHATT
Another chad video! The best part of my life rn tbh
No im mousemanjeff
I don't know why I so early to this but I'm not complaining 🤷‍♀️
she looks like a dinosaur had a child with the lead singer of kiss
Yeeees thank you for a new video
You know its a good day when ChadChad posts.
Was mid movie marathon but this is more important
Jojo siwa had to save her edgy teen phase for when she became a grown adult
Isn't she about miley cyrus' age when miley started acting insane? must be something about that age.
i knew you’d get to this 😭😭 there’s a lot to unpack
1 min ago is crazy
232 views in 1 minute? chad chad fell off.
I-I-I be poppin' bottles
This is a NO-NO Siwa moment... am I right guys?😅😅
you should do an entire video on dance moms omg
CHAD CHAD IS BACK YIPPIEEEE
1 MINUTE AGO
Was waiting for chad chad to post a video about this fr🙏
You should have known better than to make this video, karmas a bitch
Joe mama joke in the first 10 seconds hurt
I’m gonna be honest I’ve seen two year olds do better makeup than Jojo Siwa
HI CHAD CHAD :D
I CANT ESCAPE THE JOE MAMA JOKE NAUR
she's a small tiny baby, but shes also an adult and wants to have kids in a couple years, so maybe smarten up and drop the groomer friends (colleen, james)
HELL YEAAAAA
my gym teacher played karma with all the swear words 💀
Chad Chad is based and awesome
omg early
You should make the “a Twinge of Cringe” intro 1 millisecond.
marriage
yay a new vid!
Watch out! I think moto moto likes you…😨
I was a bad girl, I did some bad things I swear I did it all for fun and it meant nothing It never happened, it was a secret Like when a tree falls in the forest, no one hears it Another late night, another crazy mood And I didn't think twice what it would do to you I was a wild child, you always knew it It was a matter of time before I blew it   Thou shall not lie, thou shall not cheat Thou shall not get caught or you'll end up just like me, oh   Karma's a bitch, I should've known better If I had a wish, I would've never effed around When I saw the pics of you and her, I fеlt the knife twist Karma's a bitch, and she's with you right now   Shе is a good girl, I think she's boring (Boring) Believe me, twenty minutes later, you'll be snoring But it still kills me that you hooked up with her (Up with her) And now the universe is giving me what I deserve (I deserve) See pop shows near London Get tickets as low as $79 You might also like Karma’s a Bitch   Thou shall not lie, thou shall not cheat (Oh, woah) I'll write it down a thousand times and hope it sets me free, oh   Karma's a bitch, I should've known better If I had a wish, I would've never effed around When I saw the pics of you and her, I felt the knife twist (Karma) Karma's a bitch (Oh, woah), and she's with you right now   (Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh) Karma's a bitch (Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh) Karma's a bitch Better be good, 'cause what goes around, comes around Karma's a bitch, and she's with you right now   And when I lay me down to sleep, it's not your body next to me This lonely room feels so empty, just me and my regrets And cold blue eyes look back at me, the mirror has no sympathy My guilts become a symphony that won't let me forget, oh   Karma's a bitch, I should've known better If I had a wish, I would've never effed around (Oh, woah) When I saw the pics of you and her, I felt the knife twist (Karma) Karma's a bitch (Karma), and she's with you right now  Karma's a bitch Karma's a bitch Better be good, 'cause what goes around, comes around Karma's a bitch (Karma), and she's with you right now
new chad chad yippee
Her hand tattoos are certainly a choice of all time, if they’re real
she didnt come back like a boomerang
Ayy earlyy
I feel like this era isn't even her own, stealing songs from not 1, but 2 people
Is that a JoJo reference?
jojo siwa sounds like she has one of the toy chickens lodged in her throat
I doubt that island gave consent 😭😭😭
Damn y’all are quick
Saw two videos about this and didn't care but now that it's Chad I do 💯💯

Yea, shes being just a little bit too silly lately...
The fact I owned like 15 bows and wore them as if I would die without them😭
Jo-Jo is now an adult guys we must burn the bows
PLEASE NOTICE ME UR MY IDOL ❤
i feel like jojo took to many shrooms and then had a revelation and got akumatized
she looks like a toddler in a cheap kiss costume 😭
Im so sick of people saying she stole it. She bought it
Yess I needed someone like ChadChad to talk about this
twinge if cringe has changed so much
ITS SAYS THERES TWO VIEWS BUT THERES 88 COMMENTS WTH??????
First

Jojo is having a bizzare adventure 💀😭

WHY IS JOJO THE HUMAN EMBODIMENT OF INTENSE RASPING😭😭
I LOVE CHAD CHAD
I personally think ChadChad should enter her JoJo era and try the makeup

"I'm thinking of Asbestos"  Too real
I was a bad girl, I did some bad things I swear I did it all for fun and it meant nothing It never happened, it was a secret Like when a tree falls in the forest, no one hears it Another late night, another crazy mood And I didn't think twice what it would do to you I was a wild child, you always knew it It was a matter of time before I blew it  Thou shall not lie, thou shall not cheat Thou shall not get caught or you'll end up just like me, oh  Karma's a bitch, I should've known better If I had a wish, I would've never effed around When I saw the pics of you and her, I felt the knife twist Karma's a bitch, and she's with you right now  She is a good girl, I think she's boring Believe me, twenty minutes later, you'll be snoring But it still kills me that you hooked up with her (Up with her) And now the universe is giving me what I deserve (I deserve)  Thou shall not lie, thou shall not cheat (Oh, woah) I'll write it down a thousand times and hope it sets me free, oh  Karma's a bitch, I should've known better If I had a wish, I would've never effed around When I saw the pics of you and her, I felt the knife twist (Karma) Karma's a bitch (Oh, woah), and she's with you right now  (Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh) Karma's a bitch (Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh) Karma's a bitch Better be good, 'cause what goes around, comes around Karma's a bitch, and she's with you right now  And when I lay me down to sleep, it's not your body next to me This lonely room feels so empty, just me and my regrets And cold blue eyes look back at me, the mirror has no sympathy My guilts become a symphony that won't let me forget, oh  Karma's a bitch, I should've known better If I had a wish, I would've never effed around (Oh, woah) When I saw the pics of you and her, I felt the knife twist (Karma) Karma's a bitch (Karma), and she's with you right now  Karma's a bitch Karma's a bitch Better be good, 'cause what goes around, comes around Karma's a bitch (Karma), and she's with you right now  (love u chad)
