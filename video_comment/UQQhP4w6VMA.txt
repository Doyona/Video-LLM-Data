"Kids with guns"❌️ ❌️ ❌️ "Gorillaz with guns"✅️✅️✅️
I hate fortnite but I kinda feel gorillaz fumbling into the fortnite universe in a lore sense to be accurate and something they'd somehow do
Where's gorrilaz?
My future is coming on
*just make a MOVIE already*
Next thing u know I’m added
Why are they the young version of themselves?
@Gorillaz when will it be available again I missed it
Absolutly fucking sad to see....
disgusting collab, never gonna listen to this "band" again
Fortnite is likr smash bros.: everyone can (possibly) be in the game. Fortnight × Nintendo when?
And that my dear amigos is how my class found out about my obsession with Gorillaz
O futuro está aqui 2D
Most Gorillaz styled entrance ever
0:13 GOAL
Noodle is back to a teenager in this
no fucking way
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
不吸，你酷啊❤❤❤❤❤
… well crap now I gotta start playing Fortnite too.
Pov.when you missed the release  date =C
It's the guy from Fortnite
Yo its the guy from fortnite
Bro got me wondering if that have brain damage from that toss around
0:23 2-D has white eyes no Black eyes 😭😭😭
KE PROS, NI SALIERON DE LA CAJA Y SE LLEVARON SU PRIMERA KILL
Thanks fortnite for introducing me to gorillaz, it's all i've been listening to
This was the best and worst mistake of girls life. It was the best because before like I didn’t like music, but now I like music a lot because of that girl cloud like I mean, I’ve seen gorillas before it. I seem like a lot of things before like I played Fortnite, but then like when they put the bad thing that they did was that now Fortnite kids are taking over the concert and like oh those are the Characters from Fortnite
Этого не кто не ждал но все надеялись❤
Ha ha ha ha
Why did it end so fucking soon! I was busy!
Their known song I've heard was Feel Good which is two decades or twenty years ago and I haven't got into their band. I need to get into Gorillaz and listen to their songs thanks to Fortnite by introducing them as the new festival season.
NOOO
At least with Gorillaz, I can comfortably say "It's just a _Phase_ "
"Noodle? You look younger..."
케이팝데몬헌터스 이전에 고릴라즈가 있었지 ㅎㅎㅎ
that box is like a wizard's portal
Why
This is cool I what too be noodle >:3
They robbed us of Murdoc not having a "the future" emote
Que emoción
worst mistake of yalls lives 🥀
Nice ✨
SUNSHINE IN A BAG YEAH KIDS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LETS GET SOME SUNSHINE IN A BAG
Why am I just seeing this
Excuse me or Fortnite just adds everybody Dad a lot of characters kids probably never seen from those shows like Rick and Morty but not the Gorillaz
Fortnite easily has the craziest skins I’ve ever seen, I never even played the game but every DLC skin is crazy.
My nephew has this ❤🎉
Necesito la Playstation 5 ya!
:|
Seria muito bom viu,Uma série de Gorilaz,Conheci através de fortunit e gostei muito   Uma série de Gorilaz seria foda pá Caraí,Seria tipo o Wicky and Mort ,só para +18... ❤👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Gostei demais das músicas e do estilo de cada membro do (Gorilaz)
shame shame shame
“WHERE THE BLOODY HELL HAVE YOU BEEN😡?!” “Toilet😦-“ “TOILET?!” (man that never gets old 😭)
The best
Yoooooooooooooooooooooo
No one told me about this son of a bitch
Fortnine fans are you here ???
Now Daft Punk added jesus
If you pause right at 5 seconds, you can see a new skin
Actually fire wtf
i never got my favorite character in fortnite 0:23
Damn, looks really good
fire collab
Its about time they added yiu
ok, now take my money and give me rock the house murdoc style
I don’t really play fortnite any more but I will be getting this
HUUuuh scince when did this happen O________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________O
Honestly so based for Fortnite to play a Gorillaz song that's older than 80% of its player base.
I knew this day would come
My brother used to think noodle was a femboy
❤
“Yeah!” Is what I imagine murdoc said 0:33
No. Stop it. Stop ot right now.
yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hicieron su primera kill
Fortshite is the worst thing to happen to pop culture
One d the best collabs ever
Ay api api con buñuelo 🗣️🗣️
What happened to Murdocs necklace I thought it was a upside down cross
noooooooo whyyyy
OMG, noodle is so kawaiii🥰
Whats the Song name that played when the Box Open?
Closest thing to a “movie” trailer
Donna Texas 2025
I got all 4 of them
Howed they all fit in their with russel💀
OHHHHHHHHHHHH MURDOC HAS LIVED FOR THIS MOMENT
Это настолько круто, что я подумал это какой то мультфильм
Fine I'll start playing fornite but this is the last time
Surprised after that hit 2Ds name isn’t 3D
It finally happened
Omg i whishvi had the skin
Ages on the Reddit someone asked if people would like a collab. 90% of the comments said "Hi, Jamie" 😂
Thats cool, culture a new generation.
Im so sad now i have to hide liking gorillaz
One for the Best collaborations that Fortnite has had.
Whatttt
"Reject false videogames icons"
I had to get noodles.
0:17
Yeeeeee
AH THE FORTNITE GORILLAZ - they have phase 5 poses  -  Wearingphase  3 outfit - except 2d which is wearing his phase 4 flanel with phase 3 boots while having white eyes which are phase 5 - plus they're presented with a phase 1 song   FORTNITE BEING HALF ASSED AGAIN
I didnt know who are u and I dont higthly like your music, but, damm the disings of your characters are pretty good
Dad, I’m gonna re-download Fortnite just for those skins
Please collab with Mario kart! 😂
🦃
i first heard of gorillaz YEAAAARS back when they came to habbo hotel lmaooo. get ready for new generation.
Even without Fortnite, I enjoyed this animation. Time to shoot cartoons
Gorillaz in Fortnite, maybe Gorillaz fans or some Fortnite players should join my server... Hopefully they're not Gorilla Taggers!
THE GORILLAZ HAVE COME!!!!!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
I doubt Fortnite kids will recognize these legends
God
Oh hell nah
I’ve been a fan all my life… so sad I can’t afford the skins 💔 maybe one day they will come back when i finally have a safe and secure job.
What the actual fuck! Dog gamn rat kids!
murdoc in fortnite is really funny because who else in fortnite have we canonically seen the penis of
FIREEEEE 🔥🔥🔥 I wanna get the skins!! I never played Fortnite but I’m just going to play it for the skins but I wonder if they are limited time
0:04 0:05 0:05 0:05 0:05 0:06 0:06
Ufff el comercial de whole lota love
first hatsune miku now 2D, noodle, murdoc, and russel bruh
Best collab yet
Me encuentro bien
it would be so funny hearing someone call murdoc the guy from fortnite
Is avatar World  🙏🏻
Guys the Next collab is Madness combat fr
lovely
❤
LETS TEACH THE CHILDREN WHAT SUNSHINE IN A BAG IS YEAHHHHHHHHHH WOOOOOOOOHHHHH
Oh god, please no....
For heck’s sake
WHY AM I SO LATE IAGAH
bro seeing Murdock with a shirt is disturbing and it scares meeeeee!!!!!
they using noodles 14 yo model not her currant adult one
First game to have 2D as a playable character and its Fortnite 😭😭😭
Best music pass collab ever!
Mr President, they got Gorillaz
i am depressed IT'S DAAAREEE was my childhood, and now it's in a corporate greed simulator thanks a lot, damon
29 year old dude screaming over this
I wanted these styles not the 2023 ones
Luke the gorillaz the girl with her hair they're here at the final in fortnite 🤯 I will give you one thumbs up 😎👍
No me gusta los diseños que hace en Fortnite
오우 젠장 진짜야?
Looks like noodles is still being shipped in boxes
They get one before typical gamer no way
Still wishing they did a collaboration with PPG
I love the box referenceing how 2d was shipped to plastic beach, only this time theyre all crammed in there
maybe i may come back to fortnite
I LOVE THIS COLLAB”
Soon, everyone will b3 the guy from fortnite
La colaboración menos esperada pero más necesitada
omgggggg i love this band and i so whant the 2d buy i have no v bucks T-T
Аааааа горилаз
THATS CRAZY
I said I would never play Fortnite unless they put 2D in it... And now all four of them are in it!?!?! Shit I guess I gotta play Fortnite.
"Hello 2-D welcome to fortnite"
I wonder who’s next? Dethklok?
すご
Missed opportunity for not using the FedEx box as the intro
Gross dude.  Shame on you, Damon Albarn.  Guess he forgot about the message Feel Good, Inc. -- literally their biggest song -- was supposed to be conveying.  Everyone sells out if you give them enough time
my poor wallet :(
I don’t play fortnite anymore but when I saw this collab I screamed. Ended up buying the bundle bc I love gorillaz too much🫩
aviadaro até o gorilaz
Wait whens it coming out
WAIT STOPPPPP OMG I MIGHT ACTUALLY RE JOIN FORTNITE FOR THISSS AHHHHH
Idk why people are mad, I wouldn't of known about them if it wasn't for Fortnite, it's not bad to reintroduce themselves
Wait until froggy fresh get in fortnight
Fortnite ruins yet another thing💔✌️
Dang... I might have to pay Fortnite again. This is literally how they get ya.
No fucking way
I GOT NOODLE IM SO HAPPY
Guess 2D pac man addiction went from a 2 Dimensional game to a 3d game lol,  sad their jeep isnt available to buy from the shop,  IS cracker island songs going to come to fortnite too?
I recoiled a bit when I saw the video title, but then realized this only means it'll expose the young ones to good music, much like what GTA3-VC-SA has done to us in the early 2000s.
so gorrilaz is official broken and needs money? O.o
Amazing! 👏👏👏🔥
Ufff antes que el GTA 6
ゴリラズ来たなら久々に遊ぶか
No tiene un ojo rojo😔
YESSSSSSS
NOT NOODLE IS BOX AGAIN😭😭😭
i feel like only 10% of the people who play Fortnite listen to Gorillaz
Now we wait for the uninitiated and brainrotted to complain
Murdoc looks way too happy to be in Fortnite
Take my money...
Whaaaaaaat
I already have all of them now
Free fire Gorillaz en free fire collaboration plis
i bought the 2D and noodle bundle yesterdayy 🙏🏾🙏🏾
I would like them to include the 2-D clown mask as a character choice.
I have the 2d skin
I think I know why gorillas at those four characters in Fortnite because Fortnite has guitar playing, and those four like to make music
PEAKKKK
The collab is awesome just very disappointed in the music pass
This is amazing good for gorillaz give them new young fresh eyes and ears
Im actually stoked my favorite album of all time is plastic beach and haven't played FN in years
Being that the band is virtual, this actually makes this cannon for them. 💯😂
Finally, someone let me out of my cage! 👀
❤❤❤❤💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Wow these models look amazing!" Looks at my Goku. "..."
Which song was used in this trailer?
I may just start playing fortnite again
I got them all & love them ❤
Who asked for this
Kids with guns.. some things never change
Это самая лучшая калаборация❤
Ok i might go back to fortnite
Si mucho fortnite ¿pero para cuando nueva musica?
Im probably the only one that thinks gorrilaz should be in cod and not fortnite
Eu com a maior certeza vou comprar
what has damon agreed too
I thought they woulda been did this after 😂
When is the concert? I'd like to see it.🎉🎉
WOAHHHHH, NOW I WANNA PLAY FORTNITE
WHAT
Unexpected and delightful
Finalmente gorillaz salvará a fortnite
Noooooooo . Now you are gonna be called the skin from fortnite
This is one of the collabs that makes bloody sense. Gorillaz characters just be traveling all the time on a 3d crazy world so it makes sense they end up on Fortnite after all.
best collab
I love this! I’ve been a fan my whole life. This was an instant purchase!
can I just stop living now
This is wild 😂😂😂
My ass to broke to afford these skins 💀
FUHKH FORTNITE
reason for playing fornite:
I NEED THIS
YOUKNOWHOWLONGI'VEBEENWAITINGFORTHIS?
i coped these skins so fast istg🙏😭
If only Roblox did this
they gonna collab with my balls next season be prepared
No one nobody can't stop me
oh my peaks
About time.
Now we just need the legend of heavy metal...Ozzy Osborne.
Dude this is awesome!
Ufff referencia 🗣‼️
Fortnite absolutely cooks with every skin they make 🙏 except the dark night he’s got booty cheeks on his head
I got your skinnnnnn
I really thought nothing would bring me back to this fking game. I was wrong
Murdock didn't get his upside down cross lol
One step closer to MFDOOM
I just got the noodle skinnnnn <3
I did not know you guys made that song
They should make the place from rhinestone eyes and melancholy hill (the weird island thing with the funny looking White House on top) a part of the map
No one can escape from a collab with Gorillaz
I have wanted this sense the music pass came out 🎉
My question is when
I bought the bundle ❤
now imagine people thinking that gorillaz are from fortnite?? i can already see kids pointing out at whatever gorillaz merch and saying "woah it's the guys from fortnite!!"
I bet those Fortnite kids weren’t even born when Gorillaz was formed. Nice way to throw them into good music tho!
bro
Humor-driven commentary diffuses divisive subjects
OMG, 2-D in 3-D
This is awesome!
I’m so early guys
.
YEAHHAHAHAHAHAH
I want to buy the skins and battlepass soo bad
神だ
I NEED MURDOC CARNALLY UNNANJKklaMNGHHH
Never played Fortnite but now I just might just for the Gorillaz
Oh fucking cringe.
OMG YESSS
amazing work, if there's a character with infinite skins those are gorillaz, so many options, so many references that kids will not understand but some will
YEAASSSS
Coolest shit did back on plastic beach had mini game that was super cool 🆒
A a la asco de Carol g tuvo concierto no va hacer gorillaz una banda legendaria no tenga concierto en fornite
Tiene q aver concierto de gorillaz en el fornite sea como sea ❤❤❤❤❤❤
correct me if im wrong but the crate is a reference to how noodle was shipped the gorrilaz right? when they needed a guitarist?
Oh God Yeah 😍
This is honestly the main reason I reinstalled Fortnite, cause Gorillaz is my most favorite band OAT.
Why tf i just get the notification, i thought im gonna be the first
Do brainrot little children even know who Gorillaz are?
Gorillaz is good
This is so, so amazing, seeing them in Fortnite. FORTNITE BROTHER, was and is my floor.
La mejor fokin colaboración de Fortnite 🥳🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Pensé que nunca llegaría 🥺
That black man was a freemason🤢🤢🤢🤢
❤
Only gonna play Fortnite again for ts 🙏
Will this be in the next album? I hope this is cannon to the lore
Great, now I can't say I like Gorillaz without feeling like a poser.
SIGMA MEORGE LACKEY
Beer Intro ever
Omg!    Gorillaz￼
They should have added other GORILLAZ songs, but the collaboration was still cool. My favorite band, I really love GORILLAZ.
I need Fortnite
Welcome to fortnite, my guys
I love ❤❤
Ancianos como yo, vayan descargando el Fornite porque se viene recital virtual 😶‍🌫
i will sell my fuking soul for 7.99 just to get money to buy these skins I DONT EVEN PLAY FORTNITE NO MORE BUT I WILL NOW HOLY SHYTTTTTTTTTTT
WHERS LİNKIN PARK
Wow necesitamos en el Pubg
Fortnite doing a gorillas concert
Bro im crashing out if i get full boxed by fucking noodle
Damon oh my god.. Fortnite? It feels so surreal but congrats
This makes me wanna keep smiling playing fortnight
I literally spent all my money just to get this battle pass and other skins I've been waiting for this. This is probably the best collab compared to any other collab fortnite has had.
This is the best collab in Fortnite
Anyone else bummed that it's Plastics Beach era and not modern Gorillaz.? Don't get me wrong, plastic beach was amazing but lol use the modern Gorillaz at least.
Whaaaaaaattt 😮😮😮
Ay wey XD
Ay weyXX
Cannot get over how cute they all look in the new models. I dont play fortnight but if i did Russel would be a must-purchase lol
I didn't expect it, but I'm also not surprised.
NOODLE WAS UNPHASED BECAUSE SHE BEEN IN A CRATE BEFORE 🔥🔥🤑
Swear they are gonna bring Michael Jackson back from the dead to add him to Fortnite
Damnit now I have to play Fortnite
มันดีมาก❤❤❤,,,👍👍👍
Прикольно
WAIT WHAAAAAT
The only reason Fortnite become worth playing. For maybe five minutes.
Yall Agree we Didint expect That to happen 💀
Haa 2d gorillaz murdoc noodle and russel can the friends come of house of the malaysia
Also 2 D blakc eyes is needed!!
im a 90 boy and gorillax was the first original CD i got!! nostalgia all the way !!!
I can already imagine kids calling 2D „the guy from fortnite“
Asco
Just why
Even Gorillaz in Fortnite? Bro dibs next
Yippee!!! (Sadly only has 600 v-bucks)
Well.. I'm buying that
This does NOT make me feel good 😭
Amazed it took so long to happen. Seems so obvious to me.
Missed opportunity to make noodle come out of the box like she did on the raft thingy in the Melancholy Town music video 😭
Yo I need help I’m going as 2d for Halloween and I want to go as this version, does anyone have ideas on what kind of shirt/vest he’s wearing I’m desperate
I really hoped to see the Camaro from "STYLO" in Fortnite as well. Including the song 😓
I love gorillaz there my top band but i feel fortnite will ruin it
I’ve been a fan of the Gorillaz ever since the 2000’s. I’m not too big on Fortnite, I play one and off, but this collab made me immediately buy the bundle and music pass
It was destined to happen someday
Que bonitas están las skins 🤩  gorillaz x fornite , magistral ❤
So… powerpuff girls is now in fortnite?
As much as I absolutely hate fortnight and the fortnitification it's done to the gaming sphere...those skins looks good considering where they come from especially 2-Ds model
Esto es oro
This is one of the best collabs I am glad Gorillaz finally got re introduced in 2025, their music was awesome when I heard them when I was younger
Are this the guys from fornite?
I wonder when their next music video is gonna be
OMG ❤
i loved :3 NODDLE FAN :3
Very cool
No fucking way.
Gorillaz is actually goated tho ugh
99% of the kids that play fortnite is not gonna know who this is, the the whole snoop dog dance all over again on kids react. But great collab loved gorillaz for atleast 25 years of my 30 years lived as my uncle first played ghost train for me the first time!
already one of my favorite collabs that fortnite has ever did 😂
I would pay to see damon play fortnite.
YESSSS LETS GO MY FAVORITE BAND IS NOW IN FORTNITE!!!
La mejor colaboración
Im so here for this collabbb
dave mustaine when
Hey lets listen to gorillaz   Random kid: you mean the band from fornite  >:( 36483 south bound street   Random kid: :[
😭
Please uncollab fortnite doesn't deserve you
Hi, i like big dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dih Your loves like redstone falling from the sky
Cinema demais 👍🏻
Finally a better Fortnite Collab cuz these guys actually look cool and are more Fortnite characters   Next Freddie Mercury or Micheal jackson
I just realized this song was from trolls
the Gorillaz are perfect for Fortnite
Remember the battle royale game with gorillaz stylistic, that was in a high skyscraper?
Okay nevermind fortnite isnt ass
This may get me to finally play fortnite 😭
Wud buy if I was not broke
Bro where’s Murdocs upside down cross!?!
wow actually surprised.. nice job selling out, what a joke.
That's not Gorillaz as of late.  That's their younger models.  I know my Noodle ❤
Tomorrow comes today
might actually have to download fornite for this
I love it                              2-D marry me xd
Hmmmmmmmm, yeah this is cool and all but, who?
My husband 2D looks so handsome <3
They are doing anything but drop the album
by far the biggest mistake, but the skins r cool
At this point fortnite can collab with my dihh
What the fuck are Gorillaz?
Se hizo de verdad o lo pese mucho de eso.🦍
I’m getting tired of Fortnite being everywhere. Bring back Infinity Blade
No..im not crying bc im to broke..
My only question is how did they all fit in that box
Murdoc’s doing another cashgrab
Me and the bois playing festival as the GOATs
Bro, right when I told myself to not give epic games more money
So we get this but we cant get fat Peter Griffin. Bs
Murdoc is démon
Are they that desperate for money/relevance?
it feels good inc.
HOLY PEAK
Fortnite is ass
Welcome to Fortnite
Wow I like gorrilaz
What does this even mean ? A video game collab withh uh gorillaz??!!   I got the best video game idea to date ask me let’s make it happen ! Not San Andreas but San Kabukicho globally mobs Mofia yakuza have to work together to make their investment work the right way to Save the world.  It’s a business and the real ones don’t kill their clients it’s a business! What do u think? Logistics in the works same with finance possibly I’m making an imaginary thing into reality . 😅😂❤❤❤💐💐💐💐🙂🙂🙂 congrats on the collab! 🎊 🎉
Nah ok I DEFINITELY wasn't expecting this
I REALLY WANT THOSE SKINS😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Oh come on man
I really have mixed feelings about this as I really love gorillaz but I much prefer they he on fortnite than warzone
"OMG IT'S THE PEOPLES OF FORTNITE"
YO WHATTTT
I bought everything from gorillaz because I love them so much.
I want the Gorillaz Fortnite skins, but I’m broke so I can’t buy Vbux
If they think this is gonna het me into fortnite they are very wrong
Noodle r34 here we go
very unexpected collab wtf
gorillaz GOD
HELL YEAH
this is what its come to?
Fortnite did a great job
Desinstalo fornite Fornite: .-.
Hey moved up in the world, good for them
We better get at least a ghost del the funky homosapien emote or character to use
https://youtu.be/FJVV8o6vgso?si=l6sI0IODRvh-x7T4
fucking sellouts.  this is embarrassing.
Will Smith: NOOOOOOO! MAMA NOOOOOO!!!!! AHHHHHH!!!!!!!   (If you don't know the reference, get some culture in you)
How is this game still alive?
And just like that, gorillaz flushed all the goodwill it's built over the years
Best music collab they’ve done
Bruh why am I suprised? I should've seen like 100 miles ago.
Amooo
How did they all fit in that trunk at the same time?
we are not happy we are feeling glad
OmG aoritamismo descargo fornite
Disappointed.
La heterosexual nunca fue opción
Cool
THE DESIGNS ARE SIIICK... but they should've played *Dirty Harry* instead of Clint Eastwood IMO 🤷‍♂️
MOOOORE PLS !!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH !!!
0:22 Guatafac es el rotten
I’m coming back to fortnite
I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL BECOME INSANE IF I ASK SOMEONE "DO YOU KNOW THE GORILLAZ?" AND THEY SAY "OH THE BAND FROM FORTNITE?"
NOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooo
…what are you trying to imply with this?
The fact I was talking about Gorillaz with my friend 2 hours ago is crazy
Stop! You're gonna make me want to play Fortnite! I... I don't even like Fortnite (I'm also broke) Gah! Why do they have to look so good!?! X]
I literally love this so much🎉😊
Fortnite consumes all. We are living in a hellscape.
Por mi madre, que buena intro ❤
I'm a little convinced to start playing now
Whisper “ocean bacon” in noodles ear and she’ll solo the whole universe!
Absolute cinema 🎉🎉
Sell out
Kids with guns
Clint EastWood As the Background song i see
I've been escaping from Fortnite since it came out, I knew that one day something was going to happen that would make me get into it
Genial lo lograron, voy a jugar solo para tener una skin de esas
fortnite did not cook and these songs are terrible
i dont play fortnite but this is awesome
YES a way to have Noodle on my screen for hours on end without it being weird!
No one asked for this i won’t like this collab
Money is an incredible motivator
2D Is 3D
DUDE I LOTERALLY JUMPED OUT OF MY SEAT 😭😭😭😭 ALMOST CRIEDDDDD
My boy Russel in da house baby!!!! I'm buying the Clint Eastwood theme as soon as I get the bucks
Ayyy my fav band!
This is classified as cannon phase 9
When this collab came out I had the worst cold every as I came back from holiday and this has helped me get through it this is the best this in Gorillaz and Fortnite history
Ah shit every kid now saying that they're from fortnite
The skins actually don’t look like shit this time
As a big Gorillaz fan this may just make me jump on fortnite as the skins are half the appeal for the game I just suck at building
Excellent, adult Noodle but with her outfit and hairstyle from phase 3. Since, on the other hand, with her design from the last phase, she honestly no longer seems to be the same grown-up Noodle (different hairstyle and hair color).
OOOOOOOOH MYYYY GOOOOODDDDDDDDF
Why did they use FN cell shading? Their recent MVs are closer to FN’s usual normal style anyways.
i love how they all take from different eras of gorillaz designs to find like the best versions of all the characters with these. given how many designs there are im sure these will be getting a lot of variants
how long will this promotion last?
The best❤
At this rate even my mom is collabing with fortnite
bro i love the skin of 2-d but i can''t buy it because i have 400 v-bucks and I need 1100 v-bucks, dont leave of the shop Gorillaz!!!
All it took for 3D Gorillaz to look good was a legendary scar
Jesus Christ
gonna be my first time playing fortnite and buying a skin lol
The only fortnite collab I'm happy about
I don't care about Fortnite, but these models and their textures are hella good.
Is it a concert
THANK GOD THEY BROUGHT CRUSTY MURDOC BACK!!!!
Its funny kids dont know who they are end up saying oh there form fornite kinda sad
Can someone please gift me the 2D skin iam beggggggggin you guys pleeeeeaaaaassss❤❤❤❤
Out of any game Fortnite 😭
Thats the only way to introduce the weirdest and wildest band ever.
Y yo bien pobre
YAYYY
Murdoc should have an alternate Ace skin.
🥺 la envidia
0:06 Jajsjajaj pobre imbécil
Noodles is a pro at being drop shipped
Aiy…
gorillaz slapz either way
No way fortnite collabed with gorillaz.
Instantly got this one, didn’t even hesitate ❤🤘
Ok, but where is that Ace skin??? 🤔
The rule 34 artists are gonna have some fun with noodle
I might actually start playing Fortnite again because of this
Remember when Gorillaz where not commercial sellouts?
Yo this is a cool collab!
Oh man I hope they throw a interactive concert! ❣️
now THATS some real unexpected news
Even the best fictional band has fallen victim to the worst game ever made. This makes me so sad.
Кто резко тоже полюбил фортнайт из-за этого?
I will consider purchasing this item
Nooooo my shaylaaaa
Its over
We are so fucked
Looks like they're gonna have some demon days now
YAYY
Naaaaa ya la cagaron, ahora se les va a conocer como "Son los de fornite" y no como antes, donde la gente les conocia por la buena música.  Pero bueno, así vamos.
Disgusting. Very disgusting
Absolute cinema gentlemen
Noooo 😭🥀
i will back in fortnite
OH MY GOD???
Now we need Gorilla Tag x Gorillaz.
Just a reminder, the bassist sold his soul to the devil.  _I learned this from the in game item description._
Нифига себе!
Gorrilaz, nooooo!!
So, we can call them the guyz from  fortnite now
Hell yeah, ive been waiting for this collab for years
My most favorite band, has a collab with my least favorite game.
almost got excited for new music but nah it's just some fortnite skins bs for gen skibidi brainrot
Bebé, lo logramos!!
This would have been way better in call of duty then getting Beavis and Butthead
FINALLY I CAN BE MURDOC WITH A GUN! Wait. I don't play fortnite anymore 💀
I WAS PRAYING FOR THIS EVER SINCE JUICE WRLD
Why just why I was happy that this Collab won't happen but it fucking did
the fact i came back to fortnite after they got added :)
Bro I have grown up with the Gorillaz and to see them in a huge fan rise game is just that much more amazing 😂😂
all those kids in fortnite were not even born when that Gorillaz song came up xD
Anyone else stopped fortnite, just to come back and buy skins of singers from your favourite band, and then you'll stop playing again... you'll quit again for sure, but sleep easy knowing you can play as Murdoc Niccals any time you want now.  Edit: Lol who am I kidding im buying all of them.
please why
How much you wanna bet fortnite paid gorillaz in v bucks
Ok, I might be early Gen Alpha. BUT I did discover this band in early 2020 and man did I fell in love with it. The only thing I hope is that they don’t start calling Gorillaz “The guys from Fortnite”.
Thank you SO MUCH Gorillaz!!! It’s a dream come true !!! :)
WHAT
Gorillaz used to be GOATED. Now they're just another trash Fortnite collab.
NO WAY NO WAAAAAAY IM SHOCKED ASF
chat
I'm genuinely surprised Fortnite hasn't collaborated with persona or genshin, keep It that way
Okay now I’m happy
Cant believe im gonna download fortnite
Thank god its the old designs! Especially noodle 😭  I absolutely hated what they did to her, this design is so much better ♡
Time to start play Fortnite again
Time to start play Fortnite again
Omfg
NO PEOPLE WILL SAY “ it’s the guys from Fortnite” ITS THE WHOLE MIKU THING AGAIN
OMG ❤️🤯😃
finally ❤
Haha omg !! I was just talking about you guys three months ago hoping,, you guys will collab with Fortnite !! N now here u guys are 🙂‍↕️😘🙌🏼
Did you know this about the vid the way noodle stands up confidently is because she was shipped to the gorillaz when the band was missing a guitarist and this proves that she is used to rough rides
Oh amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gorillaz was my favourite band since 2000nds. After this, i don't think so anymore
Welp im gana download the game just to play as noodle
my question is: is this canon?
I will be getting noodle
god i wanna take a vibrator to little noodle
❤♥️❤️♥️
Por que no cambias a la escopeta 🗣🗣
I like that when they get out of the box - Noodle jump out of the box, which is a cool reference to the lore that she came to Gorillaz in a FedEx box and immediately jumped out with a guitar. And DeSole reference with Murdoc is pretty neat.
dude.... WHATTT
The bill can't be this high
nevaaa did no haaammm
Ooocheeeeeeet
Bro...
Can't wait to hit the griddy as Murdoch
I luv Gorrilaz and I like to play fortnite but im sad this ahs happened everyones gonna pretend they are fans of this band
Mañana sale mi tío Gérardo que se lo balearon los municipales
AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs
ew, no
What the f... Do Fortnite kids even know Gorillaz? I feel so dirty
Honestly i shouldn't be as surprised as i am. Gorillaz kinda make a lot of sense.
I have no other chocie then to start playing fortnite now lol
Well, shit. I might have to play fortnite now. Love seeing see Noodle in the Plastic Beach dress again.
it's so good. love you forever gorillaz.
Gorillaz, why? 😢
Batter then kai
Ngl ima buy this with the coins I saved up
Downloading Fortnite for ts
Can finally achieve my dreams of Noodle x Sabrina Carpenter collab
YESSS
I’m so mad they payed walled Russel and Murdoc at least I can get the other 2 with the free vbucks but I still wanted to get the whole band
Siiiiiiiiiii
Y E S !
It's just about time until Micheal Jackson somehow gets sucked into the infinite cycle of fortnite collabs 😔🙏
finally, i can headshot murdoc, that bastard
This announcement would’ve been so much cooler without all the leaks
This collab makes me FEEL GOOD
NOODLE IS SO CUTEEE SHE IS A NEED!!1!1!2!2!
NOOOO IM BROKE 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
He he~
Well ain't this meta
The litties skins ever 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well, this is just sad. Reject false icons.
"Gorillaz showing up in Fortnite just feels right."
Por cosas como estas es que volví a jugar fornite
maybe i gotta get back on fortnite..
Desde las páginas interactivas en los "Kong studios" (que pudo acceder) hasta la página interactiva con los minijuegos de (plastiyc beach) la si pude entrar por un par de veces, siempre tuve la esperanza de que en algún momento Gorillaz sacará algún vídeo juego de ellos, o en su caso, que hicieran una aparición en los videojuegos de "guitar hero" y jamás paso, y ahora (casi 27 años después desde su primera aparición con el vídeo de Clint Easwood en el antiguo MTV) es la primera vez que podré jugar con ellos 🥰🥰🥰 al primer minuto luego de que se activaron los servidores de Épic para jugar Fortnite luego de la actualización, compro el paquete de 2D y Noodle y como ya tenía el club, ahora a subir el pase para tener a los 4 completos, aún que me faltó Cyborg Noodle y el auto de Murdock (el del vídeo Stylo) pero bueno, quizá en un futuro venga 🥰🥰🥰 estoy tan feliz
🙅‍♂️
fortnight is fucking gay
8 year old me would be so excited to hear this news, I’m 17 now and I love gorillaz and will now be playing Fortnite everyday 😂
I don’t play Fortnite, but this might make me.
I for saw this
🤘🏼🖤🙌🏼
Why
Love how Noodle was the only coming out of the case with ease. Noodle to everyone else: "First time, huh?"
THE REFRENCES ARE GOING SO HARD RN OMGGGGG
My brother predicted this 3 years ago
So plastic beach era
At this point, what isn't in fortnite??
If you do that i will jump in the snow without clothes 😭
Bro imagine getting your ass sniped by noodle 😭
FINALLY NEWS IS BACK
Real talk, the models look fantastic. Omg if someone makes a squad of Murdoc, 2D, and Noodle, they could recreate the Stylo music video with noodle in the back with a pump shotgun
LOL
The only thing to surpass my love of gorillaz is my hatred of fortnite!
La magia de fortnite
You sellout
Creo que ya se que boy a comprar este fin de semana
when can we go back to battle passes with actually original skins made with epics own creativity
W skins i got them i love the music
…. excuse me. Gorillaz I heard that music before. Is it from rock band? Because I know your music looks familiar to me just like old times from that rock band. I don’t know what number. Is that correct?
Everyone will become a Fortnite collab...
Oh, one last thing. All right, let’s see if I can listen to your music. So OK, we’ll see if I can listen to your music. 😑🎧🎵
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have never heard of you on this channel. I’m about to listen to your music what’s this about? However, one character it does it a little bit creepy looks Russel. Hopefully it’s not that creepy a little.
Superfast Jellyfish is amazing.
No, they ruined one of my favorite bands of all time I listen to since I was a kid till now..
daman can we get a lego set pretty please :) i love you
Damn i get you guys need the bag and we getting old now. Expolit parents visas less goo
Oh hell nah bruh... Tf is thiiiiiis... 💀💀
It’s sad I love gorillaz 😊
OMMMMGGMGMOGMOGGMM
Gorillaz no 😭 why did you give in to fortnighttttt
Why couldn’t it all be in the music pass😢
Woah??? 😭 Dang fortnite getting everyone Will there be a concert within, ik fans will be happy for it (I'm fans) we take what we can get
🚨🛑💰💰💰🛑🚨
PHONK MUSIC
I'm sad seeing this because I don't even listen to Gorillaz anymore but my middle school self definitely would be excited to buy this 😭😭
No tengo fornite 😢
I LOVE GORILLAZ SO MUCH OMG
WHAT
Super glad they used classic styles for the models!
nunca me hubiera imaginado, ni esperado ésto!
Kids with guns...
OML GORILLAZ HUGE FAN
Pov Fantastic four
Sera que o del vai estar ai ( del o fantasma de russel )
Best collab fortnight has ever released!
Murdoc is the only one that looks like they wanna be there lol
https://youtu.be/cpTLiW6xn7w?si=QX3-IbhfJL9Rn7Zb
Aw guys nooo
Oh hell yes. As a Gorillaz fan this was a welcome sight
¿Does murdoc control this channel?
I’m a fan of y’all I want the pack so bad but I have to wait a bit
these kids won’t even appreciate Gorillaz .
Congratulations
Feel good
OOOWWW 😢😢😢
"We’re desperate"
HOLY SHIT MY FAVORITE BAND IN A GOATED GAME
... At least it's not Warzone.
Nunca jugué fornite pero ésta vez tendre que hacerlo.
Imagine discovering gorillaz because of fortnite😓
Slipknot !!!
Booooo!
They add noodle from the plastic beach era. Taste. My dudes.
Canon
Peak.
this is beautiful
OH NELL NAH
WHAT?? HUH?? WHA?
Fucking gay damien
Fuck, my pc dead :(
A white tear just ran down my leg
Oh great now kids gonna say things like  "wait the guy in Fortnite make songs?"
Might have to bootup my old ps5 and play Fortnite for like the first time in a year
:O unexpected collab
L collab ngl they missed so many opportunities  A lil geep emote playing 19-2000 Gorillaz logo grafitti Submarine glider Plastic beach diorama backbling Del backbling/glider Clint eastwood gorilla dance  I don't even play fortnite but this is such a miss bro
They should never let Murdoch be in reach of a gun
0:12 is battle Royale and Festival connected nvm because the Big Bang that they take place in another universe only blitz and OG are connected because they’re still in the same reality and we saw him we all thought we were gonna be surprised with the OG but nothing different besides the red rift
Nooooooooooooooooo😭
What actually happened?Because I want to know if this is connected to the lore or not.Cause how long are they going to stay there?Is this a continuation of their last album?Are we getting more albums from them in the near future?Cause I wanna know
Eeek noodles 🔥⛽️😆🥳🤩💕 🫶gorillaz
We all knew it would happen eventually! No one can escape the infamous “Collab with Fortnite!”, we literally got The Frontman the same day and One Punch Man the next day! 💔💀🥀
Me encantaría que salga algún juego de Gorillaz para ps5 o xbox 😊
😍
This is the reason im going to play fortnite
I don’t have any vbux sadly
Only gripe I have with 2D is that I wish you can changes his eyes between black and white.
Fuck I guess I gotta come back
people still play fortnite? thats news to me
Good,  maybe kids  will start to listen to good music
Btw there’s no such thing as a “joke prediction” collab for Fortnite. It’s like a black hole, eventually it’ll get you.
and suddenly fortnite seems reeeaaally appealing
Omg omg OMG OMG
Bro I was just looking for the before gta6 comment
0:15 it would actually be kinda cool to have a festival stage on the br map for like a single update and never again
Wait- ITS REAL???? I thought it was just a joke people were all in on 😭😭💀
WHY AM I JUST SEEING THIS WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
Finally I can fight Goku as 2D in John Wick's house
“This doesn’t tie in with the lore 🤓☝️”. Y’all are a bunch of nerds
I swear fortnites coming for the Fabulous Killjoys next
I don't play Fortnite, probably never will, BUT THE MEMBERS LOOK SO FUCKING GOOD!!!!!!!! I'm gonna miss Mudz's inverted cross necklace tho :/ I can't wait to search up a 3D model or showcase of all Gorillaz related stuff in the game!!!!! Genuinely wonderful designs, I just hope people won't go "Oh the guys from Fortnite!" when I reference Noodle or smth.
This is gonna be good
Murdoc is right handed, why is he holding the base like that?
Wicked!!!💀
Sweet, hopefully we can actually visit plastic beach
Gotta try and stay relevant😂 Gorillaz are fine Always thought they belonged in a game Such a weird group
Nice try Epic, you almost made me play fortnite.
NOOOOOOOOOOO FORTINITEEEEEEEE
This is fucked up. I'm going to play Fortnite
I had a dream I was at their house An met them once. No murdoc around tho. I met 2d, noodle, an Russel an There was some strange guy in Their house an Russell went to Get em. Then kid you not I banged noodle on The couch no seriously.😂
Damon brotha whyy
Your kidding right right?😂
Time to flex my cd and double LP ig
Hey, 2D does the same shielding his eyes thing as when he pops out of that suitcase in Plastic Beach.
History is being made
NOOOO IM GONNA BE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THIS DROPS AND Y'ALL ARE MY FAVORITE BAND THIS IS SO EVIL!!!!
Alright. Fine. I'll get back into fortnite
Awesome
How dare you
Glad the comments are so positive. I don't play Fortnite myself but this collab is still really cool
Cool
otra colaboracion barata
I love you, Gorillaz 🥺❤
*(slowly loads shotgun into mouth)*
Que estan tramando ???
OH MY GOD
Remember, Reject False Icons.
wtf bro they collabin with fortnite do roblox next gorillaz or clacs of clans or brawl stars please gorillaz
Next need Deftones & Green Day and let's throw in daft punk while we at it
This is the happiest I’ve been for a while
it was only a matter of time
NO WHAT HAVE YALL DONE!
maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan if this isn't what selling out looks like...
When will they add Ace?
Finally, a music festival im gonna buy!!!
What song is it at the end?
this is actually kinda hype
Is this canon?
Am I the only one speechless right now, because I have no words.
Crazy that 2-D is from the future and everyone else is from their old albums
Nice
Welp now I gotta download Fortnite
Noodle put her hair back down like back in the day
Noooooooooo why did they do this  FFFFUFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
perfect
I d'ont play fortnite but i feel that this would be the best season😊
Vou precisar baixar fortnite novamente?
Dude I'm listening to the Gorillaz as I found this and I am starting to think this is a sign to start playing this game again
I might start playin cuz of this
Me 6 years ago when I actually played Fortnite would have ATE THIS UP.
Bouta blow people's head off as a gay 56 year old green man
It is absolutely criminal we got fortnite x gorillaz and not beatsaber x gorillaz
Best collab yet
THE SKINS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE
Nah I gotta see this and it actually makes❤
Well we know now Gorilaz is ending.
I bechu Korn and slipknot is next
OMG!
They look so good 😭🙏
WTHJDISBFJSJ
Al fin actividad de gorilas hace varios años que no había
good luck
omg I've been waiting for this for so long
FEEL GOOD 🗣🔥
Fine... I'll buy the 2D skin...
Uff, what a low.
No bro whyyyyyyyyyyyy. Lil kids gon say that fortnite made them
I LOVE IT!! Thank you Epic from bringing Gorillaz to Fortnite, this is a dream come true!
This makes no sense
Bro im not even famous and i feel like im gonna have a fortnight collab 😂😂😂
Damn 2 virtual bands with virtual characters are now at the same game together
I dropped fortnite 5 years ago. Looks like I'm Reinstalling...
The old designs ? 💓 😭
WHY?! YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONES!
Eugh, really?  Normally I'd be all for spreading high culture to the tasteless throngs of preteens in fortnite digital daycare, but seeing as they already are compromising the character designs to make it palatable to kids I can't help but feel this just makes Gorillaz worse.
This band is officially dead to me.
I be playing fortnight again
come on guys :/
event pls
Damon Albarn is counting his riches rn
Im back
*Desinstalo el Fornais* Epic Games 2 p*t1simos días después:
I ain't happy ahhh
The coolest feature they could add is some sort of calling mission you have to do, and then noodle shows up in a box with a special gun and she’s your npc teammate.
The real question is 'why are everyone else in their phase 3 outfits, except 2D he's in his phase 2 outfit' ???
Murdoc’s new necklace stands out to me so much lol, I know they probably couldn’t put his upside down cross in the game but still
Murdoc without his inverted cross on is something I never thought I’d see
the collab i've been waiting for since the festival launched🧎🏽‍♀️
MURDOC LOOKS SICK👅
this is absolutely legendary, it fits SO well.
La mejor colaboración de Fornite 🎉
Kinaa weird but cool how they used the looks of the Gorillaz members from earlier eras / albums: 2d - Humanz Noodle - Plastic Beach (hair is similar to Demon Days) Russ - Gorillaz (self titled) Murdoc - Gorillaz (self titled)
Why are musicians not embarrassed by being on fortnite. What the fk is wrong with our culture
Omg !!!!!! :0 omg omg !!!!!!!! ❤❤❤
Oh.... Well, that's disappointing.
Se ve muy bien para ser skins de fortnite osea e visto skins muy mal echas y con texturas y marcados malos pero estás tanto en diseño y así están excelentes
I'm feeling good .inc right now.
oh yeahh Gorillaz of course 🔥
Why is it Phase 3 Noodle, though ?
Officially sold out. How sad.
Why
This is gonna finally be what gets me to download Fortnite 😭 😭 😭
They need to bring back Tommy guns and airplanes so i can recreate the beginning of "On melancholy Hill" with noodle
Oof. Gorillaz really is just a brand now, huh?
I love it!❤❤❤
Next Playboi Carti ❤
There is a skinless body behind the Domino's I work at.
Oh my god this is gonna be insane
Remember folks money talks.
This is some gay ahh shit man, wtf? Yall are childish 😂
I hate my life
Damn most people who play fornite are kids who dont even konw who the gorillaz are... crazy
Esperado este momento durante 5 años
The final nail
gorrilaz were in some money debt and needed money
I will never play fortnite but seeing classic skin Murdoc and teenage Noodle is enough to cure my year of 2025
gen 4 gorillaz?
these skins are genuinely fantastic damn
damn ig im playing Fortnite now?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÀAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ITS REAL
What on earth were they doing before a portal opened? "Let's see if we can all fit in one of these boxes"
Whhhaaat, oh noooooooo
Tanto para 42 tristes segundos, mejor me quedo con Naruto Shippuden X free fire está más chingón y se ven más bonitas las skins
Not expecting
How did Fortnite adapt the models to 3d than the band
Still wouldn't touch that game with a pole that went all the way to the moon but good for you guys.
É só eu começar a ouvir Gorillaz que acontece isso
Blink twice if you feel like you've been kindnapped
Came a long way from “Operation: Celebrity Harvest”, eh?
미르스띤
Please come to Tokyo😢
Fortnite ruin y’all’s collab, the only track in the pass is Melancony Hill :(
As long as they include skins and iconic songs from the band's lore, I have no problem with the inclusion of Gorillaz in the game.
No way that I’m going to download Fortnite now because of Gorillaz… 😅
I swear, Epic games is out there collabing like they’re collecting Pokémon.
must make a "on melancholy hill" map MUST
How TF Epic games only go na put Two members in the festival and two members in the item shop shxts totally a cash grab scheme 1,200 v bucks for FP and 2,600 v bucks for the Item Shop bundle with a total of 3,800 v bucks that's a 30$+ purchase
Watching this trailer felt like watching your little kid be the star of the school play, Gorillaz is one of the ones I most wanted to see in Fortnite
with the whole GTA debacle its nice when a game actually wants the gorillaz in it
If your gonna do it you better have a zombies fight where it's the zombie gorillas from the Clint Eastwood music video
Not even surprised at this point lol I hate the game but get that sponsor money guys 😂
Is this for real?
This is pathetic
WOAH
YEEEEESSSSS FINALLYYYYY
I'm not sure how to feel about this commentary on artificiality in media being used in the most artificial piece of media I've ever seen
ok, now i start playing the game
Now I have to install Fortnite, damn it Gorillaz
This is somehow the most un-Gorillaz and most Gorillaz thing at the same time... interested to see what commentary they make with it, lol
I feel betrayed by my favorite band
What the fuck
WHAT THE FUCK I SAW THIS NOFICATION AND SCREAM INSILATY
gorrilaz in fortnite: D: mor people would know about gorrilaz: :D
This was a joke in the discord when it was 1st of April
I'd rather hear a fortnightly subscription to a news vinyl
now that's bananas, you guys look great
Coming soon  Fornite x a chair
If I didn't hate that game so much I would take a look. But awesome to see collabs with video games now too
0:16 MURDOC GOT OUT OF THE BOX LIKE THE DESOLE CLIP START
I am old
Los amo... Gorillaz!
It installs now.
I wish they had better designs not a fan of any of thier looks since thier comeback
If Gorillaz made it to games…maybe, just maybe they will made it to cinematography some day…?😮
Now this is something WE DID ask for. Thank you!
omg wtf i supposed to do i have all my hours in dota and cs NOO O!O!O!O!!O
S(CREAMING)
As soon as I saw the new trailer I immediately clicked. I am so excited that a new song featuring Fortnite is coming out soon. Thanks Gorillaz ❤
*Do kids even know who Gorillaz are???*
Gorillaz, I'm disappointed...
That's funny, I just finished listening to Kids With Guns
🥲
So, I showed my cousin this as soon as he saw it, started getting happy as hell, and he said he needs it so welp looks like I know what I’m getting him
LEGO NEXT PLEASE MAKE THAT PLASTIC BEACH SET
Fortnite noodle... SFM artists, don't disappoint
Absolutely awesome one of my favorite bands
Reject false icons.
Booo not good Fortnite bad
so wait when did murdoc get out of jail
Xd
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!  why?!?!?!?!?!?!!
Amazing
I need the geep as an suv in game
I can't wait to hear kids start calling them "the band from Fortnite"
The skins look so good???? Genuinely one of the best artstyles they've used!!!!
I literally bought everything. My wallet was COOKED
Gorrilaz getting in fortnite was unexpected but of COURSE the art style works well
This is the first good collab we have had in years
Fuck yes
i buy ALL the skins this collab is insane
finally a good fucking collab.
i used to pray for times like ts
🤦
Ужасно
NOOO SO WHENEVER I TALK ABOUT GORILLAZ EVERYONES GONNA BE LIKE OH YOU MEAN THE PEOPLE FROM FORTNITE. AAHHHHH
I love the version of Noodle they chose
Andddddddd I’ve lost all respect for
Years ago I said Gorillaz would be perfect for this game lmao. I’m so glad it finally happened
GORILAAAAAZ!!!!!
THE GORILLAS HAVE RISEN?!?!
cant wait to see someone hit a clip on 2-D and pop yet another nonexistent eye out his socket
Gen Alpha when they see a Gorillaz music video from now on: "Oh look, it's the guys from Fortnite!"
First Mortal Kombat, and now Gorillaz?! This is all I always asked for which is amazing!
This was the last person I expected
They should give more edit styles for them!nice collab,but poor realisation
I WAIT THIS 5000 YEAR'S
Remember plastic beach
I fricking love Gorillaz, this looks sick and I don´t even play Fortnite
I quit playing Fortnite last year and I told my friends that the only thing that can bring me back is a gorillaz Collab. I literally screamed when I saw this video
Sick
I'd like to see more edit styles tbh, there's much better outfits
I thought Gorillaz originally stood against all image and no substance. But I guess everything has a price
Oh for fuck sake
Finally, now drop a new album ✌️
NOOOOO NOT THEM TOOOO
Why like I said it once and I say it again anything collaborations with fortnight is dead to me now my first favorite music band is dead to me
Fortnite the equivalent to selling ur soul?
I MIGHT just have to download Fortnite just because of this collab😋😋😋
Why does russel look so bland yet so good?
Crying screaming throwing up my babies
YEEESSSSSS
This is actually my dream come true.ive been listening to gorillaz for around 2 years and ive been wanting a fortnite collab so bad.well here we are and im soooo getting 2D
the Gorillaz LEGO figs are awesome, now let’s see some real sets please and thank you
noodle looks so cute it made me squeal out loud
Minimal sets keep focus on story and voice.
гоооориииииилааааааз вы живывыыыыыыыы? урааааааааа
Oh god
weak
Murdoc is just happy to be there😭
NO FUCKING WAY I WILL BUY FORTNITE
Congrats, you're canceled.
BRUH MORE STYLES PLEASE 😢 but I’m still happy it’s atleast a skin
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I’m not gonna lie, it’s crazy how so many people didnt know who Gorillaz were before they came to Fortnite. But I got ALOT of nostalgia from this update.
If they do a Gorillaz concert ingame...
oh my god! it’s the dude from Blur! (english reference)
Already bot 2D🔥🔥🔥
i luv fortnite collabs idc
Okay, being honest. As someone who doesn't really like fortnite and used to play it years ago just to kill boredom. This is the first time i think this is a good collab  (But i still hope i won't be hearing the "that's the guy from fortnite" from kids)
seriously? and i thought gorillaz are the last „normal“ beings left
I'm not really good at Shooting games, but when it comes to Fortnite, I'M THE SHIT
Change it back to how it was! The new notes ruined everything!
Ok now collab with Tyler The Creator
Murdoc's really scraping for brand deals huh...
Me just casually looking through yt notifications FORTNITE X GORRILAZ CROSSOVER? THIS IS A NEW LEVEL OF PEAK🔥
❤
19-2000 Didnt made  it :'c
The crossover we didn't know we needed.
Up on melancholy hill we be cranking 90’s
Жаль не могу поиграть
Since when did mudocs necklace change from an inverted cross.. trying to be woke?
Excuse me WHAT
THIS LOOKS MORE GORILLAZ THAN GORILLAZ HAS LOOKED IN YEARS. TAKE NOTES TEAM.
гениально 👏
It's amazing that I growing up imagined them being in a game, it's a shame it seems that will never happen. An amazing group made to satirize groups is now a lifeless cosmetic in a game they does nothing but lower the bar for gaming as a whole. A game made to pray on fans and children while giving little to nothing in return. It's a shame all the cool things and games Gorillaz could be in or in their own game but this is apparently all they and fans deserve, overpriced cosmetics with no life or love of the characters made to hold a gun and do dumb dances.
Yesh
This is amazing! Fortnite and Gorillaz are fucking awesome
Bruh aint no way I'm paying $40 for these skins...  1 of which i have to grind for
DIOOOOSSSSSS 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭‼️
❤️❤️❤️
This is very cool
THANK YOIU FORTNITE
- Respect
OH MY- GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD I BOUGHT A ####### FORTNITE CHARACTER BC IT LOOKED LIKE 2-D. I WANTED THIS COLLAB SINCE 2023 I LOVE GORILLAZ SINCE 2015- RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
they look soooo good
Can you guys make your own cartoon show it would go crazy
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
Deep inside I lost but life going onnnn like a magic fairy taillll we know who we really areeeee
This isn’t fair. I legally have to buy this.
PEAK
Can you guys make a new great song for the last one
I miss you guys I was little kid listen to your music on the radio and now I 20😢
I don’t even know what gorillaz are (I’m gen z)
Well I guess that's a way for the youngest generations to learn about Gorillaz
Makes up for so much corny ah skin drops. Thanks
It must have been a lot of fucking money
キターーー🥲🥲💖💖💖💪💪
This is my overall favorite collab I’m so freaking happy man
Absolute cinema
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
No lo juego, pero me encantó verlos de este modo. ❤😍
@ZEROisthenumber no way😮
I asked Epic games for this 5 years ago And now it came true for me

NETTSPEND X FORTNITE NEXT THING😂😂
Mobile legends
Brawl stars
Please collaborate with Freefire, not all fans have Fortnite, personally I would also like to have Murdock or 2"D on my account please it is a collaboration in which I would spend my .Thank you, I loved you, greetings  ❤ #Gorillaz Forever  👈👈🗿

WHATT
Cómo le sabe Noodle a salirse de la caja! guiño guiño ;P
PEAKKKKK
Finally someone let me out of my cage 🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Russell and noodle are wearing their plastic beach's outfits!

Never expected this, but the skins look so good!
Oi Murdoc we’re in fortnite

🎂Happy 20th Anniversary Demon Days!!🎂 🤘GORILLAZ!!!!!🤘
Welp I guess now I have to start playing Fortnite
Colabs de calidad
This is the multiverse all the big companies want bro 😭🙏

The fact that people heard songs from gorillaz but don't know it's from gorillaz is crazy like the song  Clint Eastwood everyone knows it but does not know the band ❤️‍🩹
Un poco más y fortnite le llamará smash bros ultimate
Never played fortnite but I may just cause I love the Gorillaz
I’m… not sure how to feel about this. Love Gorillaz and I like Fortnite once in a while, and the character models look really good, but there’s something about this that feels wrong that I can’t put my finger on
I really don’t like Fortnite but what I do love is Gorillaz
It's a good time to download Fortnite.
This is the only reason I would get fortnight
Whaaaaaat!!! Is beautiful😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍loveeeeee
Cool
Not noodle being in a box AGAIN 😭
cellshading ruins it
You’ve got to be kidding me.
They finally got me to install fortnite.
Im so glad you guys decided to join in fortnite. It's a big step for you Love you so much, Gorillaz!
Jesus

Windmill, Windmill for the land...
Ok fornite.... you caught me interest ☕️🗿🥀
Ojalá saquen los zapatos de Noodle en la tienda
Phase 3 Noodle😍 and Russell 💕💕

This is a sad day.
NO WAY MY FAV BAND IS COLLABORATING WITH FORTNIGHT
this is the only collab im not angry about
Esooooooooo
Kids with guns
Lowkey wish they had a Boogieman skin for this collab... I miss him...
I am in disbelief, this seems like something Damon Albarn would be appalled by, I’m all here for it though
I might actually play Fortnite now
Gorillaz doing everything except new music 💀
so peak
never played fortnite since i’m a little too old for it at 25, but it’s so cool to see Gorillaz is still staying hip and with the times 😂
phase 3 noodle best phase !!
People are going to feel awesome sporting the melancholy hill noodle skin with a tommy gun.
The guys from Fornite🙀
This is gonna get me playing again
thanks to fortnite we have lego desines of the band so if we dont get a lego gorillaz set soon im going to riot....

RUSSEL MY GOAT

From the same group that brought you 'Kids With Guns'
The goat

Man, i wish i had internet
0:09 whait a sec... a futbol stadium?
Normally I'd be excited ...but I'm not. 😑
Noodle too op
Pretty clever  Only the parents will know Gorrilaz, and they’re the ones buying Vbucks
I-i might actually have to start playing fortnite now...
next god joins fortnight and commands everyone to play and ill be joining the devil to ask why has life gotten to this point
Is the boogeyman gonna be here?(the villan in rhinestone eyes)
❤️❤️❤️
I need more Gorillaz music for this game. 19-2000, Rhinestone Eyes, Tomorrow Comes Today, Superfast Jellyfish, Tranz please gimme anything my guys.
the fortnite models look better than the models they use in their recent music videos lmao
Wow, the pixels on screen form into something my brain associates with a thing I recognise wow. I favor aesthetics over any moral principles. I love flattening the things that hold meaning into dopamine hits.    Albarn, what happened to being cautious about the growing presence of technology? This isn’t just a “fun collab.” It’s an endorsement of gross parasitic business practices. Your fans are being pulled into a live-service system designed to bleed them slowly through “small purchases” that accumulate over hundreds sometimes thousands of hours in a game that disguises exploitation as entertainment  Every time an artist hands over their IP to Fortnite, it’s less about creative expression and more about corporations deploying UX researchers to figure out how best to trap kids and their parents’ credit cards in endless cycles of attention. These collaborations aren’t art, they’re just bait . Can't say I didn't see it coming with that NFT fiasco a couple years ago. Video games as art have been erased from the public eye and maybe never was in the public eye to begin with besides satanic panic bs. Then the corporate jocks came in and made it about Star Wars or whatever else these meatheads jump up and down for. Now videogames are visuals with no substance and recognizable i.p.s.  It's all dopamine hits and catering to children and man-children alike. but whatever its just cartoon characters. All I wonder is if damon albarn got hit on the head by a boulder and just forgot that gorrilaz made music about isolation, technology and western imperialism. Palanatir x Gorrilaz when? Also 90% of gorrilaz fans are exactly that, aesthetic chasing man children who see cartoons doing music and don't think much of it.  The roof is on fire buddy, look at the news, the skys falling and we're tuned into the tomb of Jehovah. You better drop that ass before it crash Albarn.
Phase 3 Skins
The noodle glow up was for this only.
HERMOSOOOO
Noodle is my favorite character of gorillaz
no inverted cross necklace and murdoc is tall???? i’m confused
Omg yeeesssss i love this band
I’m so happy to see u guys on fortnight i remember listening to you guys as kid ❤
Fornite sois unos hdp gracias
This is freaking awesome And I don't even play the game
What
HOW
I don't like fortnite but WHAT A COLLAB
ok, ima have to say this, IF I SEE THEM IN A LOBBY IM NO ALIVE ANYMORE MY SELF
😮 Hell! Yeah!..... Oh no. Wait. It's Trans Gorillas. No thanks.
anything but one piece
EACH PF THEM IS A DIFFEREBT ERA
It's so awesome to see Gorillaz in fortnite for the first time
Nooooooooooooo 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  Oh god please nooooooo 😭😭 Don't do it, friends NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭 WHY !? 😭
Murdoc: Well this Isn’t the first time I woke up from a box In a strange place what about you old chap.   2D: This might be my first. No. No their was that time you got mad knocked me out and Fed Ex shipped me to the North Pole It was cold and their was hungry polar bears I got away barely by the skin of my teeth.   Murdoc: Really? you sure you’re not making this up I don’t remember doing that…   2D: No you did It was a really frightful experience   Murdoc: Well you made It didn’t you I’d call that a win not many people can say they survived a polar bear attacking them.   2D: Not many people are tortured on the regular…   Murdoc: What was that?  2D: :I  Murdoc: Russ!!! what about you mate!!!   Russel: This Is my first time   Murdoc: Well theirs a first time for everything :)  Russel: :I  Murdoc: Alright. Noodle!!! What about you any crazy wake up In the box story.  Noodle: When I arrived at Kong   Murdoc: Ah… how could I forget that’s when we started the band Ah what good times me and 2D weren’t really sure why the box was their.  2D: At the time I thought It was some kind of elaborate prank that a Murdoc set up   Murdoc: I’m not that cruel to pull a prank on one of my Band mates.   2D: :I
I never thought that there was going to be day when I have to download fornite
EVERYTIME I THINK IM DONE SPENDING MONEY ON THIS FUCKING GAME
Falta o Luva de pedreiro ai KKKKKKKKKKKK
New styles plsss❤❤
Can't trust anyone.
I cant
Well this is a bad idea
forsaken collab when
Pero si habrá evento?
Good news: this is gonna introduce gorillaz to a helluva lotta new people Bad news: they play fortnite   ... I'll take whatever I can get, THIS IS A W FOR ME BOIS🫶
The glider better be the falling windmill
ok fine ill play fortnite
OH MY GOD!!!
It's been fun to play with these c:
Imagin if cod collaborated with Gorillaz?
Top 1 reason why I started playing fortnite after 3 years😁
we finally got the collab
No shot this actually happened am I dreaming
They doing anything but releasing a new album 🫩🙏
Time to play Fortnite again.
Lets goooo
This shit is going  to go hard
Does this mean we'll get Clint Eastwood as a jam track after all?
I
WHAT OMG I NEED IT !!!!!
Boss
Murdoc getting out of the box similarly to how he sits up in the Désolé music video 0:18 😭 I've never played Fortnite, but now I'm super tempted to
I beg your finest pardon?
I remember years ago Damon Albarn had a big spiel about sellouts and how it's disgusting. Oh how low we've sunk.
Oh my money...
Finally, someone let them out of their cage.
Best gorillaz band in fortnite ❤️
Unironically the best theyve looked in years
Lmao… they took away Murdocs  upside down cross… such a small thing ruins his appearance entirely like what the fuck necklace is he even wearing is he a pirate all of a sudden the fuck?  😂
peak has arrived
0:05 they even referenced Murdoc hitting someone with his car
What ever happened to the whole reject false idols thing....
Va a ser epico genteeee
I've never bought a skin, and I created my account in like 2017, might have to get this though.
Agora eu começo a jogar 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I have all of your guys skins in Fortnite I'm such a big fan of you guys
murdoc is gonna be the first ever fictional character to get cancelled and removed from the game. that man can't even act T for Teen for a SECOND. shame
Never played Fortnite before and maybe never, but LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Let's go!!! This one actually is cool and we got plastic beach era gorillaz and getting noodles with a Tommy gun would be epic
The only Time Im gonna Buy a fortnite skin since 2019
I like to think that the colllab is the virtual band selling their likeness to fortnite instead of Damon and Jamie
Es bellísimo ❤❤❤
“MOM! CAN U GET NEW CONTROLLERS? I NEED TO PLAY THE NEW UPDATE!”
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Holy peak
No Way
YES!!! AT LAST!!!!❤❤❤
I wonder how they’re gonna incorporate this into the lore
I can’t wait to play as murdoc
mas nem fudendo
crazy that it took this long for a fortnitexgorillaz collab.  2020 would've been the perfect time for this considering that the Song Machine music videos showed the band going through portals. Make sense one of them would get them sent to fortnite.
Now I can finally say there's a Gorillaz videogame. Time to go beat up Goku & Superman as 2-D in Battle Royale. Lol
As a Millennial this is pretty cool that the Gorillaz are still doing their thing. 😆
I can no believe this real. Like at all/
As a person who grew up with his dad putting on a ton of Gorillaz music, music videos and animations he used to do this, it makes me really happy to see the two things I love coming together.
Forever immortalized as "the guys from fortnite"
I LOVE YOU GORILLAZ
murdoc bouta put a 3rd and final dent in 2-d's head
ts is too cool
hey its the guy from fortnite
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  Bought the entire pack, if anyone told me 15 years ago Gorillaz would be in a game I wouldn't believe them
THIS SO SICK 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
🔥
i feel like fortnite's player demographic has no interest in gorillaz, tho
They have gone to the dark side
Yooooo!! Yeah, finally The Band Join in fortnite
THIS IS SOOO PEAK 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Gorillaz is the goat 🐐
I verbally gasped watching this
YESSSS
WAIT WHAT THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING?!
Only Fortnite promo I’ll watch
I’ve been waiting for this bro
😳🤯🤩🤟😎👍💯🦍Gorillaz
Since they're going with 2D's Humanz outfit, Noodle's plastic beach outfit and Russel's EP outfit I hope they add variants from other albums like the cultist outfits from cracker Island or a robot version of noodle from stylo
No
Instead of wasting time on this you could have been making a Gorillaz feature film like K-Pop Demon Hunters for Netflix, not hating, just saying!!!FACT!!!
NOODLES WITH A 12 GAUGE LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
At least my kids will get exposed to the band!!! 😅💜🤞🏼
Can't wait for a bunch of nine year olds to listen to Demon Days and Humanz to end up despising America lol
lol wtf  I don't like Fortnite but I can't deny they look great
Son los del fortnite😮
What where's 2ds hat
I busted with Murdoc
MY PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED!!
What time the concert is?
FINALLY🎉
Bruh
I was 8 years old in 2001 when I bought their first album. Gorillaz is one of those bands that introduced me to music.
best fort colab
Hope the soulchild remix can be added at some point as well! ❤
man.........is this what's gonna get me to play fortnite.........
Best fn collab
:0
Oh hell no. God damn it.
Murdoc keep getting greener and darker! 😂 ❤
“The bath”
Whats next? Kim Jong Uhn?
Murdoc didn't even get to keep his upside down cross...
Okay but they can’t add Mj or Benson Boone??? Or even NF???
dam sold out gorillaz. o well
I bet all the sweats are gonna be murdoc tbh
I think I'm really gonna do it this time
gorillaz what skin should i buy
Y’all have no idea how much I freaked out when I saw this, I alr got the noodle and 2D bundle lol
I’m Buying Noodle And 2d Defo
Are we deadass
Young noodle as backpack
THIS IS PEAK
LETS GOOOOOO
Ain't long until the rest of the 2000s rock bands get a fortnite collab lol
Fan de gorillaz antes de que otros digan que son "los chicos del fornite" xD
Peak Fortnite collab, I dreamed of this for so long!!! Plastic Beach is my favorite album!
I REALLY REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS I LOVE GORILLAZ OHHH YEAHHH YEAH YEAHHHH I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Wait aren't this the people that made Rhinstone eyes? Because that song is peak
YO LETS GOOOOO
NO WAY DAWG 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
windmill windmill
Oh my God! Now make a playable Plastic Beach map and I can rest in peace!!
Yall rather do this then just make a series? What is this pathetic attempt at trying to reach the next gen😂
FINALLY 🎉,😭
It took a Fortnite collab for them to finally get the 3d models right💀
Since i listened first Gorillaz song (El Mañana) and became a part of their trusty fanbase, since i watch every clip and every cartoon, i expect anything from them, but heckin playing as Gorillaz in Fortnite. thats the best day in my life i guess 🤩 (even if i aint playing Fortnite, but anyway)
I have never been so mildly happy
ima have to redownload Fortnite for this one
I’m getting the skins right as they drop
Fiiireeeeeee Collab!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Goddamnit, why?
BRO I LOVE YOUR MUSIC SO MUCH I'M GOING TO USE THESE SKINS FOREVER
Can Fortnite add murdoc or any of the gorillaz members talking
miku made me kinda want to play. this made me really want to play.
I LOVE THIS COLAB <3
And the skins looks AWESOME. Very good collab.
I fucking hate this game
It’s only been one day and someone at my school already said Gorillaz is a band from Fortnite
Best collab ever in fornite (in my opinion)
Bro Gorillaz y'all probably won't but do you think y'all can gift me the bundle please! My users TT Void2963
Pls why not the cracker island character models, the colors in this variant looks dull 😭. CAN WE HAVE THE CRACKER ISLAND ALBUM VARIANTS ASWELL
come on,mom,WE'RE GETTING FORTNITE!                 -me who HATES fortnite and just wants the OFFICIAL skins
NOOO MURDOCS NECLACE 💔
this is so beautiful, especially my boyfriend 2d👅💔
wish 2-D had his dark eyes, still awesome tho
Here before my son ❤😂
AMOOO
I assume at least one of the skins includes a cool shoeshine.
No, Gorillaz, no 😭
no way
What an awesome collaboration!
Thanks for the profile
Yah cool anyway IM BROKE!!!!
❤😊 This was an awesome suprise.
Oh god, now my favorite band is from fortnite

Adventure time,family guy, and now Gorilaz
If a band deserved a virtual concert, is Gorillaz
Lets see that new album
FINALLY
Ain’t no way bro❤️‍🔥 nah I’m coping this❤️❤️👍
My only regret is that this coul be the closest we get to a gorillaz rhythm game..
😍
This was inevitable
Murdoch has to be incompatible with some of the dances!
tanyuuuu
HA VUELTO
They finally sold the hell out
how did they get stuck in the box tho?
Plz and there car 🚙  from client Eastwood
YESSS RIGHT ON MY BIRTHDAYY AHHH IM GONNA CRYYYYYYY
Bruh no one can escape the fortnight colab
This would be about the only reason i would even think about playing fortnight.......
I don’t care who Epic sends I’m still not installing fortnite
Oh naw 😭🙏
I’m glad you guys are in Fortnite!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Please Damon stop selling out......... You sold out to pop. The fall was the last great album.......just pop nonsense since then and now......fortnite............please. bring back the tank girl animator. get back to your roots. I know you hate to hear it. I know musicians like to blaze their own trail and evolve and do new things......but this is selling out...... Go back to your roots before selling out. Please...... We want demon days 2. (3 if you consider D-sides....man I love D sides)
*_No dejes de ser heterosexual 🗣️🔥_*
All my life in the mill
Damnit, it's my favorite version of Noodlez, too. Why do you do this to me, now I might have to buy it, play for an hour and never touch it again 😔
NO
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
How the mighty have fallen
I don’t have Fortnite- im cooked…..I NEED IT…
Поздравляю вас ребята. Надеюсь коллаб станет популярным

I think i need fortnite now 😳
HOLY SHIT ITS ACTUALLY HAPPENING
Omggggg ❤❤❤
Is and toca Boca World
We need tally hall next
Damon and Jamie created Gorillaz to counter the sellout nature of the music industry... they have become the very thing they hated -,-
I'll install Fortnite, I liked the update.
This was not on My 2025 bingo card😨
This collab makes me *feel good*
eu senti uma sensação muito estranha tipo, eles arrasaram escolhendo uma vibe mais plastic beach, a referência a Desolé (o murdoc saindo da caixa, eu achei parecido) e a pose daquela imagem comemorativa e tal, mas achei que o 3d deixo eles meio... padrões? eu não sei dizer ao certo, mas parece que isso deixou eles sem a essência meio "suja" do estilo do jamie.... claro, isso não significa que eu não vou gastar todo o dinheiro possível nas skins, mas são observações
OH MY GOD THIS IS SO PEAK
O wow
think that first guy is going to be ok?
No upside down cross but a human scull with a flucking sword pierced through its head is cool
Hope this doesn’t mean the next album is gonna be commercial and poppy as hell like cracker island was
Oh no... Why did you associate with this ? You just lost a lot of points in my heart Gorillaz.
WHAAAAA-!?
oh my god ...
i guess i have to play fortnite now.
No soy fan de Fortnite pero está cool 👍🏼
W
Anything but releasing a new album😭
Get in love Gorillaz so much❤❤❤❤I’m getting them straight away
NOOooooo, men. Don't sell out to this bullshit. This is such mediocrity.
I had to rub my eyes after reading the title for a seccond
Are they going to have a concert style event like with Travis and mellow ?
Yucky gorillaz sell out 🤮
Why they leave half of the members out of the pass, then add them and their best songs to the shop? They should be in the music pass. Epic scoundrels. 😂
The absolute scream i let out mid driving after finding out about this collab. I am so happy!!
Just to confirm. Murdoc and Noddles are mostly from plastic beach. Russell is demon days; and 2D is the Now Now, right?
I never thought an oldschool band would collaborate with Fortnite like this. 😭 i’m gonna call it rn, Dwayne Johnson is gonna collaborate with them sometime in the future watch 😭 mark my words gng
First Miku now Gorillaz, who will be the next virtual artist/band maybe like Studio Killers or something?
At least this one makes sense I guess?
Listo comprado todo
What a time line we live in where I can play as 2D and kill Peter Griffin.
actually peak gaming
...
THIS IS SO COOL! Gorillaz will finally get the recognition they deserve!
Fortnite: Who's Next? C'mon, tell me. XD
Hoping for "THE BAAATH"
❤🔥
Good music, shi....Game
I'm not a Fortnite player at all (rather Apex Legends tbh), but yea - I can get in for this 👀
Come to Mexico because many people from the new generation want to meet you,including myself. Please comes to Mexico❤❤❤❤🇲🇽
I need Murdoc in the German soldier outfit
THOSE CHARACTER MODELS ARE CLEAN
Noodle packin against a bunch of randos. Well thats just Melancholy Hill lol
GOD
we got gorillaz in fortnite before gta 6
... This may make me play fortnite
nooooo ...
Noodle's skin is looking more like gum Jet set radio than Plastic beach noodle
This collab is proof that fortnite is running out of ideas
The Baff 🛁
I have a loaded card ready for this and I will buy Fortnite only for this reason 😭
Russ has the Dirty Harry hat
The world is slightly better today
I might have to get into fortnite now
Gorillaz in Fortnite before Beat Saber 😭
I hope they add feel good inc.
This is the closest I've ever gotten to installing Fortnite...
Best Fortnite collab to date tbh.
Thank you gorillaz!! Great collaboration! 🎉
Sleeping powder 2d Plastic beach noodle  Cracker island Russel  (Maybe estrage times) Murdoc
They should have put Ace.😢
I can’t wait
Oh how the mighty have fallen
SCREAMS IN SPANISH*** :D
Que god❤👌🎹🎧🎶🎤🔥👹👌❤
😱😱😱😱
Live long enough and you'll see all of your childhood commodified into disposable, pointless crap.
si
Plastic beach noodle and russ. Pretty cool
So dope 😁
MORE VOMIT NO one asked... ff*********fornite
Gorillaz thank you for this collaboration 🥹
YS YES YES YES YES YES YES YES. I DONT PLAY FORTNITE A LOT BUT THIS IS ALL I WANT
Take my money!
Love Gorillaz, will never play  Fortnite. Could you guys just collab with a good studio to make a Gorillaz shooter/platformer/rhythm game and throw in a Tankgirl cameo. The missed potential there is absurd, and it's bewildering something like this has not happened yet.
BRO WHAT
yes!
The future is in a bag
Goty❤
I didn’t see this coming! I’m so happy to see a slightly younger version of the band. It’s nice to see Noodle from earlier on. Such nostalgia 😄
This wasn’t something that I expected to see.
O omg i so cooooooooooooool
So coming soon to fortnight you can get into a lobby with Goku, Hatsune Miku, Chun Li, Master Chief, Lebron James and the Gorillaz   If you told me this 4 years ago I would have called you crazy
Is this in canon? 🤔
Dope collab, everyone is looking good!
Even Gorillaz? 😭😭🙏
they captured each one my boys essence perfectly ♥️
Wish I could say I’m surprised but no one can escape, but hey now the kids can know that MURDOC IS GOD
Guess im playin fornite. Didnt see this day coming! 😅
OMG I LOVED IT
Oh no, am i going to play fortnite now.
A gastarme todos mis pavos
Nooooooooooo!!!
Miku: "Oh you guys here too? :0" Murdoc: "Yeah, duh! :D" 2D: "Wait, is this how we ended up here?"
“Who the hell is Gorrilaz?” -99% of Fortnite Players
The baaaath
Okay maybe i'll play fortnite
🎉
Oigan hay un snack filipino qué se llama siga snack y en la envoltura tiene un recolor mal hecho de 2 d con pelo verde y ojos de anime
FInally!
LETS GOOOO!
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE BROKE ALL THE DAMN TIME BRO. PLEEEEEAAAASE STILL BE IN SHOP ON SEPTEMBER 2ND PLEEEAAASE
Kids with Guns
Gorillaz doing anything but dropping the album😔
Perfect noodle outfit choice‼️‼️
Somehow the most normal thing they had ever done, at least according to my BF's crash course on Gorillaz lore
Murdoc is just excited about the collab $$$
It's a shame that i don't play Fortnite. 😢
I would love to see their old school models from early 2000s.   Not these ones.
Was hoping they would get added to Multiversus before it died, but this will do nicely
Ne dieron unas ganas extremas de volver a fortnite
"Take cool shoeshine son of a bit-"
Gorillaz ruined their repuatation. sad.
Fuсk off!
Not the fictional band I was hoping for BUT VERY APPRECIATED!!!!! (I'm kidding, I haven't played in ages but I still love seeing new skins come in 💙 this almost has me coming back!!!
Murdoc not having his satanic cross feels so wrong lol.
HUH???
As a huge Gorillaz fan since forever, i'm really sad to see this. I hope it turns out to be a ironic or sarcastic commentary on populair media. Don't give a shit about fortnite tho, take cringelord eminem anyday
THEY FINNA LEARN SUM REAL MUSIC 🎶
gorillaz 🦍
mentiria si les digo que no salte de emocion, grite, abri la ventana y grite, lance mis cosas, grite, llore, fui a tomar agua y luego lance el vaso
THERE  NO WaY LETS GO
big up
This is just depressing to me. Everything is corporate and bad now.
The last cult forever!
OMG 😍😍♥️♥️♥️
The guys from Fortnite
godammit now i cant listen to gorrillaz anymore
Me encanta 🎉
Russel and Noodle look great, but 2-D and Murdoc aren't as good as they could be.
stoopppp stopppp stoppppppp
"Feel Good!"  A collab like this is unexpected, but Perfect! They did a Wonderful job on the trailer and the designs look Fantastic.
oh hell nah
Love gorillaz
Just to split them up. Fortnite ignorance just like making you grind for double levels on bonus just for more crap edit styles
I guess someone Drank Kool-Aid
Christ sake. Fortnite is like Disney: enough is never enough
PEAK IS HERE
Best collab ever since chapter 2 season 8
Finally. I knew this would happen someday; but I'm glad it didn't take another 2 years. Glad to see the Gorillaz finally dropped in Fortnite.
aahh pero para cancelar la peli son buenos
Revivieron 😍😍😍😍 están hermosos los amo. Tomen nota para la fase 8
I have the 2-D skin
У нудл уже давно новый дизайн
Is this the beginning of phase 8?
GOOOOOD🔥🔥🔥🔥💥
Aw, seems they removed Murdoc's inverted cross necklace in favor of a skull necklace.
LETSGOOO FINALLY SOME PEAK
I’m so happy Gorillaz is getting recognition
I got 2D and Noodles so far!! Russell and Murdock im getting tomorrow. I was waiting for this collab for so long I refuse to miss getting the whole gang! Actually playing now with Noodles lol! "Dare" to be great!
Did not expect this
i hate how good the skins look. WHY IT HAS TO BE FORTNITE GODDAMNIT.
Broooooooo
Noooooo my moneeeeeeey
Even cartoons are selling out... goddamn
Me and my friends definitely buying this sh.
FORTNITE I AM NOT GOING TO PLAY YOU STOP TEMPTING ME YOU FIENDS
So glad you joined fortnite luv u guys🎉❤
Everyone is from the plastic beach album but 2D is from the now now?
Immediately got 2D and equipped the Pac-man backbling and Emote on him.
I listen to your music for a really long time and I hope you comment on me 😮
Can we get a damon albarn skin along with it
World is dead
I'd rather have a 2D hand drawn animated Gorillaz movie. Also, please give 2-D his black eyes back back. Make Murdoc less green too. Thanks.
Murdocs sideburns flopping around bothers me for some reason
Fornite quiere meter a todo rl universo con ellos
I had like a year’s break from Fortnite but - this is easily the collab that’s bringing me back
YOU CANT JUST DO THAT 6 DAYS BEFORE MY PAYMENT CHECK COMES
Omg
Finally, in the year 2025, I can watch Murdoc A-F Niccals do a Fortnite dance
Mi play 5 no funciona  😢 pero ire a repararlo hoy solo por esto lol
Next must be tyler the darskin that was arrested in austin- COPS RECOGNIZED HIM SAID THAT SHOW WAS AWESOME!!!
0:38 OMG THE CRACKER ISLAND TOUR PROMO REF WITH THAT POSE
I swear if even one person says “the guy from fortnite”🤬🤬🤬🤬
The models look really good honestly.
FINALLY A SKIN WORTH BUYING
Shut up and take my money
God damnit I hate how these actually look very well made, it looks very good
What in the hell
now this is epic
I'm uncertain as to how to feel about this.
I was literally saying to myself they better have the noodle dance from Dare, and I think that's what that emote is. I hope.
Uau !
Esas si son colaboradoraciones de las Goood!!!
i can already see the new gorillaz album “gorillaz trapped in fortnite” or something
$30 well spent
Imagine someone having never heard of Gorillaz just for that person to say “It’s the people from Fortnite”
Fookin Class 🤍🖤❤️‍🩹🤘🏼😍🥰❤️‍🔥👑🐐
YES
I actually said "5 hours ago" out loud in excitement
Can yall gift me the "2D" skin for free?
MAN this collab Feels Good.
Not gonna lie that’s cool but I play rainbow six siege baby
How the mighty have fallen
Looks like we got Phase 3 Noodle too. My favorite phase ever
._.
ITS SO PEAK
I don't even play Fortnite, but hey, it's Gorillaz:D!!
When?
👌🔥🔥
Je suis déçu de Gorillaz ...
amazing!! 😍
gorillas
they put chew dee in fort
Best festival pass and collab!!!
I definitely need to get these!
Now the newgens are gonna ruin gorillaz
Cool collab bro !! 🔥
I just imagine that Russell will somehow blame this on Murdoc😂
Ok, necesito comprar todo
i did NOT expect this shi bro 🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀
As someone who hates Fortnite with a burning passion, I genuinely don't know how I should feel. Hiding underneath all that disgust and disappointment, I feel somewhat...glad? At least this will bring together people who have and haven't heard of Gorillaz so there will be interesting topics to share. I will never play Fortnite, so I hope you gamers out there have lots of fun with this one 👍
this timeline is crazy
This is the last crossover I expected Gorillaz to make. I gotta admit, they look amazing. Also, I like how they replaced Murdock's upside down cross necklace with a skull and sword to keep it friendly.
I've waited so long for thisss ❤❤🔥
I guess ill hop on fortnite for the 1st time
Finally the younger generation will know this band. I’m tired of trying to explain Gorillaz to my younger cousins only to hear “who’s that?” A month later cuz they forgot 💀
Awesome!!!!
I love gorillaz
Wow, this sucks to hear!
Oh that sucks
Agghhh, so tempting! But I don't play this crap!
the bills can't be that high
I wasn't expecting this
Bro Gorillaz i love your music and now you’re in fortnite…Amazing
Now this is EPIC! 🎶
now i have to buy v bucks 😭
As a Gorillaz fan I am happy they are getting up there
I love you
Top tier
Ahhh the "Demon Dayz" modelz
The future is coming on ❤
WHATTTT!! THIS IS AS PEAK AS THE MIKU COLLAB ! :00
finally i can crank 90s in a squad with Murdock, Miku Hatsune, Rick Sanchez and Peter Griffin.
Just brillant!
Ya llego Gorillaz 🎉
YEEEEEEEEE
COME ON!!!!
Puta madre pensé que esto nunca iba a suceder...
It's so cool, the designs are just on another level, long live Plastic Beach!
Kinda wish 2D had his helmet from dirty Harry or a outfit from that music video
IM A SCARY GARGOYLE ON A TOWER, THAT YOU MADE WITH PLASTIC POWER 🔥✍
Keep trying fortnite, I'm not playing your game no matter how many goated bands you put in it
Lestgo
I wish you guys had a live event what a miss
let's goooooooo
Reject All Icons, unless they bring a 7-figure check!
Even Gorillaz is being dragged into this godawful bullcrap
What is GOING ON 😭
NOOOOOO
kanye collab when
Oh no...
My fav band in Fortnite? Hell yeah.
Gorillaz and Fortnite in the same title is something I definitely wasn't expecting to see today
I shouldn't have said I'd never play that game. 😂
Why
I can't believe this is real! :D
Bought the leader and got a dub lol
No. Hmm-mm. Never happened. This is all an illusion.
This is sick, was hoping for alts with the groups wide eclectic style
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Just waiting for BTS 💜💜💜💜
LETS GOOO, boutta be running through squads as Noodle 😂
NOOOOOOOO
This week just keeps getting better first I get married now this
No, NOOOOOOO , MY FAVORITE GROUP AND FORTNITE
Who droppin on cracker island?
This song was a hit when most of the fortnight players were not even born, bet children are confused who this characters are
0:15 😎🦍
Esta es mi favorita de todas❤❤
Their biggest mistake...venus planet love was destroyed by global warming
Waking up to see this posted by Gorillaz made my day     ✋😐🤚
Omg❤❤❤
Noooo Murdoc necklace what happened??
FORTRILLAZ!!  Also I really hope there's a feel good inc track because this collab is making me want to play fortnite again 😁
Kids with guns, bum bum, kids with guns
Isso é perfeito!!  Gorillaz é Fortnite juntos💜
Rusell mi fav
Damn, never thought i’d see the day Gorrilaz jumped the shark. But here we are.
Finally. A reason to play fortnite.
why though lol
нудл бы всадил
Sesame Street next, I wanna teabag as big bird
OMG I WISH I PLAYED FORNITE DAMNIT THE DESIRE I HAVE TO PLAY IS OVERLOADED
It's a good collab but I think they could put all four of them in the music pass like Metallica
"Molino, molino para la tierra" 🗣️🗣️
this collab is the best
Holy cow, wasn’t expecting this to happen
Oog oog oog golliraz
Boutta play fornite just for this trust
I need a gif of Murdoc doing the family guy surfin bird emote
Joya
Perfect! In the perfect theme! Clint Eastwood!
🥱
this is going to be cool
we got gorillaz in fortnite before half life 3😔😔
Ah man cmon. This is fuckin’ lame guys.
Q son estas pendejadas
Awesome! Hopefully younger people will listen to Gorillaz.
when one piece fortnite
Glad to see your collabing with Fortnite.
If they have an in-game concert, I'm picking up Fortnite
I’m not mad, I’m just confused..? Though if this means gorillaz gets enough money now to go back to doing things like plastic beach then it’s worth it
Yesss i love gorillaz and fortnite
When
Возвращение графики к истокам! Ну как минимум к 2017 году
They added mid to fornite
NO WAY!???
LETS GOOOOOO
THE GOATS
Oh no 😔
FUCKING BRUTAL LONG LIVE TO GORILLAZ
now we just need a helluva boss/hazbin hotel collab and I'd be good for life
I'm going to shit my pants.
This one is going to be the best collab
this is the stuff we want btw, character focused story stuff, not collab number 4000 where they stand around and the feature artist does 90% of the work
Finalmente se logró
adding queen 🚫 adding addict ✅
So uh, what exactly is this game again now?
Best update ever
Why that noodles ???? Is bestia the one we got now
Leva todo o meu dinheiro Epic Games
Oh no
Quede mínimo común múltiplo verbo to be
Murdoc is not in his "rock the house" garb.  No sell.  Never played fort night.  But, I love the Gorillaz.  Creeping up on the big 30 already ... Amazing.
...why?
NO TE PASES DE LANZA LAS AMOOOOOOO LAS QUIERO TODAS
Thank god they gave us plastic beach noodle ❤
why 🙏
Really Good Collab
NO WAY.
Yo no juego Fortnite pero de repente tengo una necesidad de hacerlo
how did this even happen like how did they come up with this
Noodle casually getting out of the box because she's used to it already.😂
anything besides touring
how do I put this for boomers who don't play?... Guitar hero? Rock band? It's just a side game within fortnite with its own battle pass and rewards.
I love this so much
How orgasmic I wonder if they'll release a new song because of all this.
I can't even be mad, this makes perfect sense
They almost had me with Kratos, but they won me over now…
Well gorillaz is now just azz instead, had a good run i guess😂 unsubbed & disliked
YESSSSSS
😮 time to buy some Playstation store card 💸💸💸💸💸💸💸
AINT NO WAY
LETS GO
This is something that makes me want to actually play fortnite, even if i don't like fortnite at all
WHAT
frustrating it is to want to buy all the characters from your favorite band but not even have the console to play 😭💔
Gorillaz the goat🦀
I NEED a Metalocalypse set for another Adult Swim Collab
So happy about this
Trying really hard to get me to try this stupid game I’ve somehow avoided so far eh
Ugh, why must fortnite consume all that I love. First Harmonix and now this?? Can we go to the timeline where trump wasn't president, fortnite stayed a simple 1vMany game, and the Gorillaz TV show actually happened? Because this timeline kinda sucks by comparison...
A new album: ❎️ "The guy from fortnite": ✅️
OMGGGGG I'M GLAD THEY USING NOODLE WITH HER DD HAIR AND THE ICONIC PB OUTFIT OMG
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO YEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHH YESSSSS OOOOOO HELL YEAH
Idc about Fortnite, but glad for Gorillaz and younger generations discovering Gorillaz I guess....
I feel sorry for them
This is a cool crossover.
Cómo en desole 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Unironically so fire.
DREAM COME TRUE!!!!
I feel GOOD already now it's the 10th season of Fortnite Festival! Let's get it, Gorillaz! HOO HOO HA HA!
0:05 “Get out the way!”
Now this hurts.  Finally I understand how it feels. I wanna take this moment to apologize to db fans, miku fans, every fan basically. Y’all right It feels trash.
Oh god 😂
Imma deleating my Gorillaz abums....
I hate fornite and now by this gorillaz
I kinda fw it
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES BEST SEASON EVER
Love gorillaz but ts sucks ass
I’ve BEEN DREAMING OF THIS DAY FOR YEARS
Los pases músicales son tan malos que tuvieron que llamar a los top globales
I'm not have fortnite 😢😢
I must be dreaming
Fine ill play fortnite
Finally a good music pass
It’s the guys from Fortnite!!!
It all comes back to Kids with Guns
I got Russell tattoo on me bout to head right bacl to fortnite its been a min
How funny is it that 2D is the only one without a skin that involves with Plastic Beach
Cool 👌
Who’s next crash?
This is an average afternoon for them.
ALL MY LOYFF
I’m not proud that i spent all of my money on these but im also really proud that i have all of them 😭
Why no 4K Image?
giving noodle flashbacks lol but more like someone finally let them out of their cage
Welcome to Fortnite
Wow I hate this...
It's all gone to shit
🤦‍♀️
Dayum, EPIC finally gonna make me install Fortnite.
I stopped playing Fortnite, but just because of this I'm going to start playing again
Finally a good band!
half life collab!!!
playing again because of u guys
AAAAAAAAH ❤❤❤❤❤ THANKS SO MUCH
FINALLY lol I saw a Reddit post in ‘22 about this
Imagine they collab with Fall Guys next💀
W
I'm glad to see Gorillaz finally arrive in Fortnite. Honestly, they should have been the first band to appear in the game. But hey, better late than never. I'll probably buy the 2D skin now, even though I don't play Fortnite that much. 😅
WTF IS THE BEST COLLABORATION I'VE SEEN I LOVE YOU GORILLAZ
Well it means I might be able to collab with them
Now I'm actually gonna play the game
LFG
Looks like after all these years I’m finally gonna download Fortnite.
Murdoc nem parece tóxico aqui 💀
Get your bag. Make album.
Yup, that's a brand.
Been wanting this ever since Fortnite started collaborating with musicians. Finally <3
yes im gonna buy it..
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ok, now i want radiohead
I LOVE THIS
Man, i feel good.
part of me is like nice gorillaz recognition but ew its on fortnight
Holy peak 🗣🔥🔥🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣
I just took ONE step away from school and got this   Imagine we get GTA 6 x fortnite collab😔
Kids with guns
NO FUCKING WAY
do they even get money from this?
Yay
Nooooooooooo
Now I have to get this game again 😔
lowkey might be the one thing to ever get me to play fortnite again
Plastic Beach era too?!?!?
i'm going to cry
What the hell?!? I have never played this game before, but I have to find a way to install it (my laptop cant handle this) but I have to find a way to get all four
Guess I'm playing fortnite now
Too bad I don't have money to buy the 2D skin
IMA PLAY FN AGAIN
NO WAY! IM DEF BUYING TS
Plastic Beach COSTUMES! THAT'S MY FAVE ALBUM! Whoooo! The first album I've physically gotten since it introduced me to Gorillaz!❤
Yeeessss 🗣
the second best phase!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOW this is a collab
This is a bad thing.
THIS IS SO AMAZING I'LL NEVER PLAY FORTNITE BUT THIS IS AWESOME I LOVE IT
Buena colaboración, pero de sacar nueva musica nadie habla
I will be buying ts 😂✌🏽
Wait... Noodle is a kid and there are guns in Fortnite, right?
FINALLYYYYYYY! 💓💓💓 LIVE,LAUGH,LOVE GORILLAZ!!
We've come a looooong way since their appearance on Habbo Hotel  😂
Super!!! 😏😏
I remember the Animal Crossing concert back in covid times. It was amazing
can we do drivebys with the Geep???? 🤔
Definitely the peak of fortnite with this collab, also I love gorillaz 🖤🔥
I BEEN PRAYIN FOR DAYS LIKE THESE
Jesus even my favourite band as kid is in Fortnite now! XD
Awesome... Im still not playing fortnite
Clint Eastwood Gorillaz I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag I'm useless, but not for long The future is coming on  I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag I'm useless, but not for long The future is coming on It's coming on It's coming on It's coming on  Yeah Ha, ha!  Finally, someone let me out of my cage Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm counting no age Now, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared I'm good at repairs and I'm under each snare Intangible! Bet you didn't think, so I command you to Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable Pick and choose, sit and lose all you different crews Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?  Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube Like you lit the fuse You think it's fictional, mystical? Maybe! Spiritual, hero who appears In you to clear your view when you're too crazy Lifeless, to those the definition for what life is Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit You like it? Gun smokin' righteous with one toke You're psychic among those Possess you with one go  I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag I'm useless, but not for long The future is coming on  I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag I'm useless, but not for long The future is coming on It's coming on It's coming on It's coming on  The essence, the basics Without it, did you make it? Allow me to make this Child-like in nature Rhythm, you have it or you don't That's a fallacy! I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies Through Russel, not his muscles, but percussion he provides For me as a guide Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eyes You perceive with your mind, that's the inner So I'ma stick around with Russ' and be a mentor Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember What the thought is I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead No squealing, remember (that it's all in your head)  I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag I'm useless, but not for long The future is coming on  I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad I got sunshine in a bag I'm useless, but not for long My future is coming on It's coming on It's coming on It's coming on It's coming on  My future is coming on It's coming on It's coming on  My future is coming on It's coming on It's coming on  My future
Sell outs
These are unironically the best 3D models Gorillaz have ever had. I liked the recent ones too, but these capture Jamie's style and overall cartoon expressiveness like none before. Lowkey wishing Fortnite lets them use them outside of the game lmao... Or they should collab with them for the next phase.
Crazy they couldn't all be in the music pass. The price of cosmetics in video games is insane.
Never was so hyped to load into fortnite im just going to play bcs of the collab 😭
Still no Funko Pop figures?
2D vs El Chapulín Colorado Absolute Cinema
YESSSS I LOVE THIS
I hate fortnite so much but this is cool. Still won't play but hope this spawns a meme
🎶🔥💯🔊
This gon be SICK people
In Gorillaz lore, did they go to the Fortnite world? Or in Gorillaz lore, did they agree to a collab with the Epic Games company?
IT'S RAEL🔥
Qué chimba 🔥🔥🔥
it's so peak...
Ugh…now I gotta get Fortnite back…
yey :D
They even used my favorite song
LFG
Hi izzy
If they get Hunter/x, we’re definitely reaching a Ready Player One future.
Darn, now I actually have to play Fortnite
I don't know if i should be scared or happy that this is happening lol; I feel like Fortnite kinda is.. eh.. yikes?
this is officially my favorite fortnite trailer
:(
Not me going to play this game only for them.... 👀😅😍
REJECT FALSE ICONS REJECT GORILLAZ
00:8 is that crime city
NOOOOOOO
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮💀🤑🤑🤑💀💀💀💀💀💀
Hey gorillaz I probably won't get the skins in fortnight cause I haven't played since the end of chapter 4 but I'm happy you guys are in fortnite but who knows I might return for ur skins
As a huge Gorillaz fan that plays Fortnite I’m so freaking happy!!!! 😭😭😭🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

BROTHERS, THIS IS AWESOME !
This is amazing, I love it.
Gorillaz video is awesome ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks Fortnite, today is my birthday and you gave me a great gift.
Vou ter que jogar fortnite só para isso?
Why does 2D look like phase 4 instead of phase 3???
Love that they’re referencing Phase 3!
Plz no …
IT'S FINALLY HERE
Ok but hell yeh
The only time I’m gonna play fornite (what’s funny is I’m wearing my gorilaz shirt.)
It looks amazing 🤘
Murdoc's left-handed?
Oh no...
u guys sold out....
I was immediately scared Russell would be skinny 😭
I don’t even think they were invited. They just showed up
YAYYY, I LISTEN TO THEM SINCE “Clint Eastwood” I NEED TO GET THOSE SKINS NOW!!!!✨🩵🫶🏻
WOAAHAHAHAHGAG THİS İS REAL!
And now Gorillaz is ruined :(
Been waiting on this collab for years. I hope many more people discover and love this amazing band!
And we all bought that bundle and music pass✌️😂
Легенды должны быть везде,даже в фортнайт 💙🩵🤎💚
Cringe.
q loco
NOOOOOOOO WHYYYY
Well...I guess I have a reason to play Fortnite again 🥲
For once I might actually play!!!!
Never were interest in that game. Played few times, but now I want to play this game. Shut up and take my money!
W
IM LEAVING FOR LONDON TODAY TO SEE THEIR SHOWS!!!!! Yessssss
You should of told them to add Damon.
How mighty have fallen...
In the future, we won’t have concerts, only Fortnite exclusives with dead artists
Y'ALL GOT ME WITH THIS FESTIVAL RIGHT
those 3D models looks so much bettet than the cracker island models
Dang they have Davie 504 here
Recordemos que esto será canon en el lore de Gorillaz
have you considered retiring?
I've heard of Fortnite, but I have no idea what it is. I saw advertisements for Darth Vader, Spiderman and Naruto as playable characters but can someone explain to me why they have musicians in a fighting video game?
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy........
I can tell they took their time cause no collar ever looked this good before
Jajaja qué chidooooo ❤
Very excited for more kids to learn about Gorillaz!
I don't care who you send I'm not playing fortnite
BRO THE MODELS LOOK AMAZING!!

I’m excited for people to be able to discover gorrilaz
Phuck It. I am finally installing this shi.

0:31  THEY LOOK SO GOOD⁉️⁉️

Ok be ready for a LOT of noodles running around.
YEAHHHHHHHH

I HAVE BEEN BEGGING FOR THIS ITS FINALLY HERE!!!😭😭
Me gusta que se hagan mas referencias a Plástico Beach que a cualquier otro disco, ese es mi favorito.  Lo voy a gozar... como no lo puedes imaginar. 🦍🔥
👎
😮😮❤❤
La skin de Noodle sin dudas es la mejor de todas 🤩❤
Okay hear me out: Gorillaz next phase takes place inside of Fortnite with this same aesthetic
Time to ask my dad to get me these
.... says a lot that they had to use a twenty year old song to get any recognition whatsoever.  This is the worst news about the gorillaz since their animated series was cancelled for the trillionth time
IM TWEAKING
I can't imagine how happy people who've been playing Fortnite for a while and are also fans of the band are! I never played the game myself but the designs and aesthetic fit Gorillaz so well!
YESSS!!! ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS!!!
Are we serious? Is this a way to platform the genocide in gaza? Is this your way to stand against the American empire? Damon, my namesake of my leftist teach. Wake up and smell the bomb fragments.
Gorillaz feat  invincible x family guy x simpsons x Rick and Morty x dragon Ball x Star wars feat Eminem x attack on Titan
"Reject false icons"
Oh my days.. the last 9,987 (27/8/2025) makes me feel old… love you gorillaz (og ticket)
Ahhh! Must resist... not play Fortnite...again...Gorillaz to goated ....addiction to strong...
The final image is beautiful 😭😭
Ahh what shame ....
Reject false icons (I will be purchasing)
Tuffy sadly I don’t play fort anymore
I feel like this wasnt needed, like yeah its good promotion for them especially if they making another album, but now all these people are gonna start listening to them and not know any of the backstory or anything and its gonna mess up the culture
well he's called 2d for a reason
Fiel al canon
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO GORIIIIIIIIILLAAAAAAAAAZZZZZ it's so funking awesome, finally this collab happened
I will quite literally play Fortnite for this.
PORQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 😭😭😭
Reject false icons.
👎🏿
Pika
noodle skin goes SO hard
THE ANIMATION IS SO SMOOTH 🥹🥹🥹🥹
No no no no no no no no no no no!
This is sooo freaking epic! I have goosebumps
Is this canon?
Gorillaz and Miku were the best this year.
FINALLY❤❤❤
Goty Gorillaz leyendas
I hope we get more songs. Only having 4 of your masterpieces is the only real sin with this Collab  I hope y'all negotiate with Epic on more songs. I will literally pay whatever I need to for now songs. I hope we get Andromeda, Cracker Island, Silent Running, Rhinestone Eyes, and 19-2000😊
Merry Gorillaz in Fortnite‼️🗣️
THE APRIL FOOLS JOKE WASNT A JOKE AT ALL WHAT
RAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
I yet again hate that I don't want to play this game
Sold your soul...
Trying to get your kindergartener demographic, I see. Have you listened to your own lyrics?
WE NEED CRACKER ISLAND AS A BAND TRACK
1000ths comment fire sons gorrilaz btw
Adult phase 3 Noodle is gorgeous
So even them got catched from The Great Absorber
Best Fortnite festival collaboration in 2025.
I feel good
NO WAY
Murdoc should have a scar face skin
i am disappointed in you gorillaz... smh. oh well. at least we get cool new gorillaz models for vrc lol
... heck yeah
and i just stopped playing fortnite 😭
IMAGINE:  A future Powerpuff Girls Collab that includes ACE with FULL GORILLAZ GEAR, ready to join them!  AMAZING. 💗🥲💗
lol
Feel Good.  Only complaints I have are no Shark Sub glider for Murdoc, other then that this is awesome.
I dont play fortnite but I'd still be mighty tempted to try just for this
*Shut Up And Take My Money 💸*
i hate fortnite even more then i did before now.. you got to be really wanting money to do this
Congrats man, hopefully this will shoot your already well claimed fame into the stars into a new galaxy where they will discover your music as pure art
The only time I wanna play Fortnite and CAN'T
I’M FEELING SO GOOD
Ni modo, tocará jugar fornite
I didn't expect this even in my wildest dreams lol I'm so happy
They are visiting from the Valley of Pagans
for = hello, nite = demon
A collab in fortnite i dont not mind tbh. I love the gorillaz
Gorillaz doesnt need this. the fans dont want this.
I do want a gorillaz game dont know what it would be though.  A platfotmer? A adventure game? Noodle in a arkham style game?  Either way fornite never drew me in with its collabs and they done a LOT of collabs i would care about.  But i am old and i dont care for fortnite. I am so old i remember the original presentation for it at E3 when it was a tower defense game.  Then it became goofy pubg because trends.
Somehow, gorillaz has returned.
fortnite just got good
anything but new musicb
Wow
if I like that
well there goes my next paycheck!
Gorillaz in Fortnite before gta 6 is crazy sauce
i see more collabs with Fortnite  more than i see my father  ( IM JOKING DAD I KNOW YOU OVERWORK )
Nem fudendo, agr que eu volto a jogar
LETS GOOOO I got Fortnite crew, ima get 2d and noodle in sept
Me encanta gorrillaz no sabia que los necesitaba en un juego y ahora los quiero aun mas
Guys i might start playing fortnite..
Bruh....
WWWWWWW
How do we reach these kiddsssss
holy peak
MOST OF THESE CHILDREN HAVE NO CLUE WHO THE GORILLAZ EVEN ARE
I haven’t touched the game since John wick, I can’t lie I’m tempted to redownload it now
Nobody talking about how each of them reps a different phase?
I can finally hit the gritty with 2D
Look I love gorillaz and all but how are they in fortnite before sonic the fucking hedgehog
Finally, a collaboration that deserves our full support.
You know you’re desperate for attention when you do a fortnite collab. This is just pathetic and honestly I’ve lost a lot of respect for these guys.
Nice gorrilaz finally selling out my man?!
Now they can really be some Kids with Guns
Es bellísimo 🥹 👌🏻
Ok, MAYBE I’ll come back now
Gorillaz nooooo…. Have some self respect
This is the best collaboration
she looks badass
the only fn festival after miku
We're reaching levels of sellout never before seen!
the skins actually look awesome!!
Okay I think I'ma play Fortnite now lmao
I remember when Gorillaz was punk...
Bruh wtf
Feels good !
Finally, someone let me out of my cage. 🔥🦍
whattt
Who?
FINALLY! I'VE BEEN WANTING THIS SINCE THE TRAVIS SCOTT SHOW, BECAUSE GORILLAZ IS THE ONE WHO LOOKS LIKE "FORTNITE VIBES"(OR FORTNITE HAVE GORILLAZ VIBES).   ARIANA GRANDE? MY EGGS! GORILLAZ IS THE ONE WHO GOES WITH FORTNITE.
❤❤
Bro I'm going to school and have a gorillaz bag I swear if ONE person says "OMG UR BAG IS FROM FORTNIGHT!" I will not be happy
Oh man imagine they add in Murdoc's Winnebago with the Bren ontop from his MTV Cribz appearance. Wishful thinking tho but still would be a funny thought.
I'm buying literally every cosmetic I can
2D in the Saturnz Barz fit
Claro... Porque no?
I need a gun...
Why isn’t the skins in the locker under the icon series???????????????
...............why?
LET'S GOOOO :D
wait what
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH GORILLAZ🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Awe babe noooo. Don’t sell yourselves outtttt.
Hank Hill: something  ain't right with that green fellow i tell you what
literally my most wanted collab i'm so psyched its finally happening 🙏🙏
Best collab. Period
Uuuggghhh I wish I tolerated Fortnite to get this skin buuutttt I don’t like Fortnite 🤷🏻‍♀️
finnaly a GOOD music pass colab!!
🧐🍷
This hurts, but in a good way
Damon laughing his way to the bank right now
I thought I was hallucinating the title
Is it possible without politics?! This really annoys me. Why do we always have to get involved in politics? (Israel and Palestine)
FIRST MIKU, NOW THIS?!?!?!?!?! WHAT PARADISE IS THIS
Is this the first time I'm playing that garbage?... Nah. But it's great for those who are Gorillaz fans and are 10 years old (Fortnite fans).
Fuckin boooooo
yeah we know bro 🤦🤦
Maybe I will install Fortnite only to be on this concert
MY BABYGIRLS ARE HERE
Fortnite collabs are truly out of control. Anyday you will see the Pope getting a skin.
Thanks, I hate it 😭
This is peak
Awh man come on 😢😢😢
Oooohhhhh 😮😮😮😮😮 games with music
Alguien que se aya parado a las 6 a para verlo
like canzer
Crazy, that Fortnite has genuenly turned into Ready Player One at this point .
2D & Russel look so disappointed 😔 me too guys me too…
Fck it im playing it
This got me feeling *really* good ᴵⁿᶜ
My disappointment is immeasurable.
I want this skin          The bundle
Remember the time I got fully introduced to this amazing band, 2 wonderful years, finally 😂
YESSSSSSS
Noe I can have an squad of Gorillaz, Miku and Slim Shady!
SO HAPPY THEY DECIDED TO GO WITH PHASE 3 NOODLE!! Dont get me wrong i love all of noodles phases but phase 3 is my personal favorite :33
I'm so excited to see them in the Item Shop!! Always nice having your favourite band go into one of your favourite games
Murdoc's skin is all sticky with something.
Finally, a reason to play Fortnite again
:(
IT'S PERFECT THEY ALL LOOK SO GOOD THE SPEED AT WHICH I BOUGHT 2D
Im buying it now🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Youtube shorts creators are ready for ts
About damn time😏😎  Welcome to the World of the Plastic beach Map🏖
woow this is crazy-.
You’ve failed us
Damnit now I have to download fortnite again
Of course they wouldnt put Murdoc's Cross upside down and his red eye lol ... Imagine a Pazuzu backpack 😂
Hey, hey, let me get a heart
Oh, how the mighty have fallen…
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A DAY LIKE THIS
❤❤
Can't wait for logic
Let's Gooo!!!   Been waiting for this since an ex friend of mine was livid she couldn't buy the BTS Collab pack way back. And when I said "It'll be alright,"she shot back with  "What if it was Gorillaz, and you couldn't get it!?"
Es bellísimo
So glad that the music is reaching a new generation
Noodle is a mix of phase 2 and 3?
These guys are about to grow their fanbase three times bigger. I’m so hyped
Anything but typical gamer 💔
Por fin un buen grupo, ojalá metan su coche
I don’t respect anyone who sells out to fortnight (it’s my opinion and it’s not that deep fortnight kids)
W😭
Downloading right now🩵
At least younger people will be exposed to Gorillaz..
Sigh I guess they'll be known as "that guy from fortnite" from now on, just like the others
Cannibal Corpse × Fortnite
Ya blew it
Never played this game before.. might try it…
...as much as I dislike that game, the models look sick.
FINALLY!!!!
Plastic Beach over a decade ago... Gorillaz really in the hack era now huh...
NOT EVEN GORILLAZ DUDE 😭😭😭
Holy! Noodle is wearing the converse!!!
!!YAIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh, it FEEL GOOD to witness this Collab!
Coisa linda coisa bela
THIS IS THE PEAK OF THE PEAK!!!
Botted the likes award
Where cracker music is not here Fortnite
Who knows? They could make a Plastic Beach-themed map, while they're at it...
😢 noooooooo........ Fortnite have clam y'all too sad day in history 😔
No fricken way. I never expected this to happen but this is so rad.
Sad. You have become false idols you warned us about
ЭЩКЕРЕ КРУТОЙ БЫЛ ТУТ!!!
Why ı am not suprise btw Russel crack his back like old uncles XD
Sellouts
Best Collab since Metallica.
noodle phase 3 ??? instant cop
finally
wha the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuk
HELL YEAH
It'll be cheap and easy to make music videos now
I’ll come back only if they do a concert on Fortnite and purely to watch if live
Noooooo!!! Why Gorillaz? Why :(
Yay! Gorillaz! 😃
sorry for your loss
Do gorillaz fans approve this or nah?
STOP. STOPP
I think this is the last time the band let Noodle decides their mode of transportation.
Ne! Ani tak se tam  nevrátím. Ale pěknej pokus to musím uznat 👍🤣
YESSSS!!!!!!
Gorillaz in fortnite!!! Let's go!!!
What.
Does this mean tank girl in Fortnite?
“I’m sorry Murdoch, I’m cranking 90s in Fortnite!”
Every time I join Fortnite it crashes and then I get this ad I guess I’m really lucky to miss out on this
why god why
Love the Stage. best one yet
How long until we get a Kpop Demon Hunters collab
very good 🔥
you sold out man, ya folded like a chair
Time install Fortnite again😤
Anything but the new album 😭💀
Murdoc was the reason they got into fortnite lbr guys lol
I mean... More eyes on Gorillaz I guess? Yay?...
Peak has arrived
I remember that about a year ago the official 2-d account on Instagram published a possible collaboration with Fortnite, the problem is that it was for April Fool's Day but in the end it became real
FINALLY!!!!
Yes! noodle got classic outfit. My favorite album
Finally, a reason to play Fortnite
It feels like fortnite is targeting me specifically
damn this might be the reason i actually buy fortnite lol
OMGGG

2D looking like a crackhead 😂
That fez gotta be glued to Russell's head

Imagine fuckin getting murked by Murdoc
A NooDle tá tão lindinha❤ ela saindo da caixa na maior naturalidade, já se acostumou kkkkkk e a guitarra drla ficou top
So mainstream for the normies
Fuck Fortnite. Give us something real.
I knew i was saving my vbucks for a reason
Oh cool! Then I remember that I don’t even like Fortnite. Why can’t we have regular games anymore I’d love to see these guys get their own

WHERES ARE GIANT DISEMBODIED HEAD?!
Is this what makes me try Fortnite?
WHAAAAAT
Everyone's back at phase 3, huh.
Okay, now I got a pretty good motive to play fortnite
IT'S HAPPENING!
Might come back to fortnite now
Ich mag gorillaz aber das ist ein no go 😅😅😅um Gottes willen
I'm definitely grabbing the 2d and noodle bundle. I'm just gonna be busy today, sadly
Murdoc is cured from his bright green skin complexion
damn they know i be shilling out vbucks for Gorillaz
Siiiiiiii
ain't no way 😭🙏
Brilliant.
Nunca gostei de fortnite, mas agora cogitei começa
I’m buying all the skins
Que es lo que veo hermoso ❤❤❤
OH. MY. GOD. this is literally my favorite band/musician. i'm so glad for damon albarn.
This might actually get me to play Fortnite again
Hell nah
THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO THIS GORILLAZ🥹 i will forever love and cherish this💗💗💗
GIVE ME DEL THE FUNKY HOMOSAPIEN AND I WILL BUY EVERY GORILLAZ SKIN
This is one of the best Festival trailers I have ever seen for a season! I may not be a Gorillaz fan but seeing their music come into Fortnite is amazing.
Im going to be able to be my father murdoc
это пизда, зачем.........
gng this might be the only reason I will consider playing fortnite
Are you KIDDIN ME? Dont make me download this game 😩💀
If this person is named 2D, why isn't he in 2d, graffiti, or stickers?
W Gorillaz🔥🔥🔥
Eu não esperava por isso huahuahuahua
NOT what I was expecting on my recommended page but DAMN
Oh God they're being introduced to the impressionable youths
Fortnite ugh ew no thanks
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY !!
I trusted you and this is how you repay me?    It’s any wonder why they’re using Clint Eastwood from Demon Days. An album that, no exaggeration, came out TWENTY YEARS AGO.  What’s next? You gonna do a crossover with Black Sabbath so you can reanimate Ozzy’s consciousness into Fortnite? Or better yet, why not use Eddie Van Halen so the kids have a hip role model to show them why smoking is cool. I can’t wait for the WW2 x Fortnite crossover event where they recreate Pearl Harbor as a new addition to the map.  If only I could buy the battle pass but Epic said the deed to my house isn’t worth enough to trade.
Cineeeee🗣🗣🗣🔥
finally a goated fornite collab 🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
i don’t play fortnight 😔😣
Never felt compelled to play fortnight before untill now 🔥
They all look amazing, but I don't play fortnite.
This is sad and pathetic.
Please, Damon Albarn, give me 200 bucks at the store. I didn't have enough to buy the ski. I was short 200 bucks from the noddle.😢
fornite balls i'm gay i like boys
Fortnite got really tempting
I got chug jug, in a bag
❤😂
Unexpected notification
This was such a WILD Notification to get
if noodle doesn’t have a DARE emote with a giant head on the background I don’t want it
Am i the only one who hates this collab?
now this i gotta buy.
This might convince me to play Fortnite..... maybe..
Se me cayó un ídolo..
This is what I wake up to😭
FINALLY!!! A collab I actually WANT
peak 😭😭
Ay nooo, no la hagas tan rico fortniteee.. (por fin algunos que si pegan con el juego por así decirlo) y ojalá noodle tenga más skins
OMG YES FINALLY MY FAV UPDATE OF THIS!!
Appearances look like midway between 3 and 4
Feel good 🗣️🗣️🗣️‼️‼️🔥🔥🔥
Mandatory cop
I thought this was COD 😂
Well... I couldn't care less myself but I'm happy if others are happy lol.
Ffs I'm not playing fortnite
Noooo!!! Why Gorillaz?? Any game but this garbage.. first time in history the Gorillaz will not be receiving a like from me...😢
THIS COLLABORATION IS SO GOOD
Add more songs please I need more
dope. sick. rad.
no one can escape being fortnitized.
So finally they sold out.
ok ok i will download fortnite
Noodle... 🤤Toda
i dont play fortnite, but after this collab i will
Where really rocking the house with this one huh?
YEEAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
Noodle looking like a hybrid between phase 2 and 3, looks great honestly, not gonna play fortnite tho
I was thinkin its a clickbait, but nah its real😭😭😭😭
😍
Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!! 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘😎😎😎😎😎😎😎❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
AHHHHH THIS IS A SUPER GOOD BAND
👅🎭🎸
I love the Gorillaz, I truly do. But the only thing that's going to get me to play Fortnite is if someone pays a billion dollars in cash without banks taking any slice of it
Who's next? Slipknot?
Lets go Fornite x Plástic Beach
Why always collabs with Fortnite??
Omg Gorillaz is in the game!!!!
Nothing gets over a jet 2 Holiday
I hope murdoc has a cracker island variant, that would be cool…
Gorillaz has truly fallen...
I don't know how to feel about this...
Ich kann das alles nicht mehr
Noodle has been traveling by box for like 30 years
Wow
Боже как же они деградировали
Why do franchises have to commit suicide by joining fortnite
What the fuck?
llegaron 5 años tarde pero bueno LLEGARON
huh wuh
We need a Gorillaz game.
I don't want to leave on this planet anymore.
Why
LET'S GOOO
Cant wait!!!
Been waiting years for this 🙏  I am so happy it's finally real
I never knew we're getting a collab of this
Finally
Im loving it! Hopefully we get more jam tracks of yah
My dream came true and they did it right 😭
So what's in the pass thoigh?
WHERE THE FUCK IS MY ALBUM I WANT LOREEE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This was not on my 2025 bingo card😭
the box reference was so great
SIGN OF LIFEEE
:0😮😮😮
I love gorillaz AND fortnite
This cell shaded 3D really works for them to maintain Jamie’s sketches I don’t care much for Fortnite but consider me intrigued. And I do love how each member gets a different phase for for inspiration!
Based
finalmete! gli unini, i primi che dovevano arrivare
Gorillaz has been real spoiling us lately
0:23 OHH ITS EVERYWHERE
2d can now reenconter with his long lost cousin hatsune miku
Por fin estuve esperando este día ❤❤ son mi banda favorita
Why
We getting fortine collabs before the album
We’re shabadababing feel good with this one 🔥🔥🔥
yeah unfortunately for my wallet im gonna have to get it all
God damn it now imma have to reinstall Fortnite fuck my life
As a massive Gorillaz fan this makes me sad I don't play Fortnite 😭
if 2D got his eyes balck back it will be gr8 & fitting 4 him just like noodle came back at Phase 3
Murdoc looks messed up lol no Satanic cross fort? Not even the D-Sides Statue? 😂 nonetheless, this is Awesome.
The best thing is that this is PROBABLY canon
Gorillaz has officially completely sold out...
get that bag boys
LETS FUCKING GOOOO
Рил?!
TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY
😭😭
We got Gorillaz in Fortnite before GTA 6
HELL YEAH
Fortnite needs to be terminated and end their updates on everything like the first Overwatch game that everyone loves the most than Overwatch 2 which Overwatch 2 is more boring and not fun. So fortnite needs to be gone by this year and never return to any gaming platforms ever except for casino games in a real casino that has Fortnite Slots where only indians(redskins) play it for their entertainment.
I'll never play Fortnite but god damn this is the closest I'll get they look so good
Now I WILL PLAY FORTNITE🤧
NO WAY! Dream come true!
u should of made windmil an emote ngl.
Buzzin only play fornite main stage, and this collab made me so frikkin happy.
There better be styles for all the different outfits and phases even though I don’t play Fortnite and I’m not gonna buy the skins
*NOODLE SKIN* 👁👁
JUST YESTERDAY I PREDCTED FORTNITE WOULD COLLAB WITH GORILLAZ
I haven’t gone back to Fortnite in forever, but this….
If they get Plastic Beach in the game im just crying
Congrats! People will now recognise you as the guy from fortnite!!  If you told someone few years ago that Peter Griffin, Rick Sanchez, Godzilla, Thanos, and Gorillaz  would be playable in the future, you would get publicly hanged in Mongolia or sum shit
I’m getting Fortnite now
Yippers
I had to check my calendar to make sure it wasn't April. I love Gorillaz but there's no way I'm playing Fornite in the year of our lord 2025.
We got 4 songs in the game now but like any festival season they will add more. I wonder what the others will be x3
So excited for this
0:29 💀
OH
Lol “Kids with guns”
Gorillaz in Fortnite heck yeah!! 🔥🤌🏼
I got the whole set not a MINUTE after getting in the game I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
Ewww no, I think my Gorillaz shirt is going in the bin now.
PEAK
Less freaking goooo
Why did I start crying when I saw this I don’t even like Fortnite 💔💔
This collab makes so much sense! they both have a similar vibe!
HUH?
Nah man this is peakk.. 45 levels is alot tho🤩
ЧТО. ЗА. НАХYЙ
Gorillaz x Fortnite before gta 6 😰
What😭
I want a Gorillaz x Battlefield 6 collaboration but EA has just a bit of integrity
I am truly happy for the people who will be able to participate in this event
btw why did russel trip??? THIS IS ELDER ABUSE 💔
Goated
if only i played the ded game.
THEY DIDN'T DID THEM DIRTY YAAAAY🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
I *NEVER* saw this coming at all
Tf??
damn, gorillaz are sellouts now...
"Shut up and take my money" 🤣
I'm getting that noodle skin the second I can
The only nitpick I have with this collab is 2-D doesn’t have a edit style for his black eyes, he only has his white eyes. Everything else, fucking peak!!
AYEE
Highly ironic
I've been playing festival mode since season 1 and I find shooting games pretty boring in general. However, festival mode is excellent, it's a spiritual successor to guitar hero.
PEAK
Murdoc should be mouthing off like crazy in this
Fortnite sapeeee
Well, many children will discover gorillaz
Ufff gorillaz hasta dentro del buscaminas la rompe. ❤️‍🔥
It's time to start playing Fortnite
Great way for a younger generation to discover this amazing band.
I think for the first time i actually wanna play fortnight lol
Now I wish I liked Fortnite
Thank you John Gorillaz
I might have to commit the cardinal sin and get fortnite now
Better question why not a fortnite event? Would be dope to be fighting zombies in the Clint Eastwood music video and messing around in white void of the rock the house music video
A sad day
EU AMO GORILLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZ❤❤❤❤❤
time to get back on fortnite ig
Achooo
God is dead 🥀
those models look BEAUTIFUL
about damn time
FOR THE LOVE OF OZZY OSBORNE, GIVE EM A CONCERT!
w collab 🔥🔥
Let's go!!!!
I felt uncomfortable 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼  Why gorillaz😞😭
TAKE MY MONEY
New album, please🥺
WOOOHOO
Can Gorillaz do a feat with Massive Attack ? I know Damon Albarn did, but the two groups would work well together, espically their trip-hop style
Really wish I liked Fortnite, so many collaborations I love but I just can’t get into it
This was long overdue in my opinion
Finally, my biggest dream of terrorizing the entire server with noodle came true ❤️
Next album please
GORILLAAAAAAAAZZZ!❤❤❤❤
Wait....it was actually real?!?!
Ok, you have my attention.
0:09 hey I thought crime city was destroyed?
Wowwww❤❤❤❤❤❤
That's... pretty random
YESSSSS!!!
um okay gusse its to expose more young ppl to thair music not at bad move tbh
God please no. Catch me on Melancholy Hill crying about this collab... Nothing is safe from a fortnite collab. Next we'll have a NSYNC collab, bet.
If I did play Fortnite, I would so grab the skins.
WHAT
Holy sh*t is that Stupid,.. they just want to make money,. why now my favorite Band in a shi*t game Like that...
The only colkab that makes any sense. Virtual band in virtual world.
I fucking knew this would happen
This feels like Gorillaz selling out massively. I'm really disappointed.  This goes against everything Gorillaz stands for. Becoming another income for a massive corporation.
nice😮
Fortnite truly is the master of all crossovers.
Cool but no that game was ruined for me long ago.
I don't play Fortnite and I'm happy this collab happened!
Peak!
I just noticed that each of them have an outfit from each phase for example: Murdoc phase 1, Russel phase 2, Noodle phase 3 and 2-D phase 4
WOOOW❤
IM JOINING FORTNITE AGAIN FOR THIS!!!
Fuck no
FANTASTISH!
So fucking lame dude
Gorillaz finally did something objectively wrong (besides Bad Bunny collab).
No juego Fortnite, pero me va a tocar descargarlo 😢
Gorillaz has always been for the kids and it's nice to see they still value that to this day
And they got my fav noodle!!
im crying WHY???
❤🎉🎉🎉
yo
❤eu te amooo murdoc,manda um oi pra mim por favor
2D is 3D now
I need a gun to keep myself among The poor people who are burning in the sun But they ain't got a chance They ain't got a chance I need a gun 'Cause all I do is dance 'Cause all I do is dance
Well there goes saving my money 😭😂
TOMORROW COMES TODAY
This would be the only reason I come back to Fortnite.
Is it just me or does anyone one notice Murdocks necklace not the anti cross but it is a skull with a sword in it
Real
I never knew who created the song clint eastwood until now
Pls make  "sunshine in a bag" some kind of special atack
What the fuck…
THIS IS CRAZY
DISGUSTING. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.
Yoo they look amazing 🔥
Nunca jugué Fortnite pero lo voy a jugar por Gorillaz
OMG YEEEEESSSSSSE
I want to mention it here because, where else and why not. Back in 2018-19, i was struggling with severe/manic depression, to the point i had hallucinations. I re-discovered the Gorillaz, and became hyperfixated on their lore, from past to present. During Covid i purchased and watched their live online concert. They were legitmately the only ‘people’ that made me happy. I would cry listening to “Humility” because I told myself that when I got better, that that song would be the song I listen to to celebrate getting to that point. In 2021 my cancer came back a third time, and i wanted nothing more than to curl up and let it eat me away. My friends and family bought me so many Gorillaz shirts to wear in the hospital, my favorite albums, and some of my artsy friends drew the members, including my then and still favorite Murdoc. I’ve been in remission for 4 years. And tho my depression is still pretty bad. Its not nearly as bad as it used to be. I still listen and keep up on their lore (which this collab is gonna need some CRAZY explaination). I listen to Humility now and cry at how far I’ve come. I don’t know where I’d be without this bands music. And my family/friends ofc. I hope one day I can meet Damon and hug him and thank him for all he’s done for me without even knowing me.
I’m excited
Poor russel looks tired
LET’S GOOOOOO
So glad they did Phase 3, Cyborg Noodle is a pleasant surprise.
WE GOT GORILLAZ IN FORTNITE BEFORE GTA 6?
HERMANO QUE COSA MAS LINDA🔥
Broqueloco
I need these so bad
Im still surprised Fortnite is still big
Let’s go
Oh no... Now fortinte kids gonna call 2D "guy from fortnite" 😔
Let's go!
dance should be "sleeping powder"
Looks like I’m playing Fortnite again
At least they used the best Noodle design.
Oh fuck no
I havent played fortnite in ayear, im going to buy the characters with the vbucks i have and never use them
hi
Yeee ...ees finally my favorite band in one of my favorite games
Please just tell me the festival pass is mostly gorrillaz stuff and not a bunch of random crap
This wasn't on my bingo card for this year :O
Amazing
Eu nem jogo, mas achei muito maneiroooo essas skins dos lendários
Fortnite's still got it 🔥🎸🎙🥁
ohhh the desole reference when murdoch gets out of the box oh yeah
trust this is tuff
guys who’s about to pick up fortnite again!!
OMG THEY LOOK SO GOOD!!! I don't play Fortnite but I'm happy to imagine Murdoc gunning down his entire team and then getting sniped by Hatsune Miku 😍
suddenly I care very deeply about fortnite
I’m gonna actually cry
No way
Duuuuuddddeeee I need it
Would love if I played Fortnite, maybe consider making a game with Nintendo and I'd play ▶️
Guys just make an album pls but dont do this shit 😩
My Goats in fortnite, I'm so happy
The desole reference is so cute
Nice🎉

Damn- I did not expected this lol Looks fire tho
Best collab ever ❤
OMG QUE BUENA COLABORQCION
AHHHHHHHH COMO ME INSTALO FORNITE EN EL CELULAR
Very interesting
Ya know usually I would say collabinh with FN is just a sellout move, But this is an exception. They did so well with these guys it's ridiculous. ✋😭🤚
I GOT 2D!!!
Fuck yeahhhhh
Give them a new music videos from fortnite ❤!!!
I'm so happy we got the four in fortnite I'm buying all the skins also love how murdoc was happy to be out of the crate
Pls give us the windmill as bus or something
New gold. Fools gold. Everything will disappear. Someone out here. I've travelled far too many years. To nowhere. Nowhere. Nothing here is ever real.
HOW THE HELL DID RUSSEL FIT IN THE BOX?!
IT’S COMING UP!! IT’S *DARE!*
LET'S GOOOOOOOOO
NÃO ACREDITOOOOOOOOOO, MANO EU SOU FÃ DEMAIS DO GORILLAZ
noodle getting out of the box immediately is cute because she's used to staying in a box for long periods of time
my bank acount will now suffer😢
don't make me reinstall this game and blow money on it again, damn you!!
Rather do this than make new music 😔
Love thissaaa
oml I’ve been waiting for this
PLASTIC BEACH NOODLE YESSSSS PLEASE HAVE CYBORG NOODLE TOO, THAT WOULD BE SO COOL 😭
I've been waiting for this since the first festival season
Oh my god my two favorite thingsss
¿Que diría mi general Khazoo en estos momentos?
Noodle grew her bangs back! 🥹
I’ve been waited since 2023 for this and have lost several bets, but this time, I’ve finally won.
Absolute art
THIS IS SO COOL IM CRYING

This is the moment
Y'all I might gotta redownload Fortnite for ts
Me and my bestie literally SCREAMED when my brother told us that they were in fort! 😂😭 ima get everything!!
Just wanna let you know Gorillaz that i bought the ENTIRE SET in fortnite 😭😭
YESSS I NEEDED THISS
🦍🎸
I wanted Gorillaz & Deadmau5 almost 5 years ago. Now I don't play the game anymore. Y'all missed your chance to work with big name artists like this when you promoted musicians no one heard of
It's spreading
I was praying for this collab sense I was little
The collab we never expected
They MADE IT made it now😂🔥
Fortnite and gorillaz coming together is so unexpected and expected at the same time😭😭
