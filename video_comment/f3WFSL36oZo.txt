Thanks for the mention :) I made a whole new channel and I've been in school for nursing so I don't have that much time to race to the finish of these games anymore lol
27:33 how the frick does he know
A midway is like the company or brand that hosts carnival & fair rides. If there was a CoryxKenshin fair then the midway could be like “Ankle Brakes” as the brand of rides & attractions.
This got me dying 24:59
This just Fnaf security breach ruined 12:12
I recommend silk song hollow knight
ItS mEnT tO bE reFrIgRaTeD
Thank God, you’re finally back
Did he cut this out? 0:47 also! Is that Overhaul from MHA that’s talking as Arnold? 3:43
25:01 “ÆÆÆÆÆÆÆ-“
19:05 that elephant really caught me off guard
I remember when FNAF was about Freddy faz bear ,Roxy ,Bonnie and chika
Oh I know Entoan and Dliveee that was the good old dayssss 😭😭💯💯💯💯💯
35:49 that was so funny
Its funny how he Screams 😂 24:55
17:03 is the repair clearance symbol not just a rotated tf2 logo?
33:56 THATS PUPPETS MUSIC BOX SONG
23:12 cracked me up
Yea I'm black I'm not gonna sit there and power up
Bro this guy's videos bro they always making me laugh. Whoever watches his vids and not laugh just has no personality
27:34 watching this at 3 am got me scared
ggs. Cory's frames are hitching.
17:48 bro single-handedly roasted Lankybox without even realizing
13:29 just realized this is the dormitabis music
WAS THAG PERSONA MYSIC 2:20

Cory🔥🔥
Cory😢😢 I've been here for ten min the elephant is camping im stuck😭😭😭
You know what’s happening next it’s robot just because you robot that’s in a box until you go to the office room. We could borrow those boxes and then so let’s play it in the run is before the event and then she can get you by start the run, but I forgot that part if you don’t have the run or you do have to run, but mostly you don’t.
Lowkey Cory is and will forever be the best YouTuber, I always watch him when I’m sad or when my moms mad at me and somehow I always forget about my problems when I watch him
Remember 25 dollars backs in the 70s is like 100 or 150 dollars so it’s even better then the other games
29:22 proclassgamer I think?
Hair is TEAAAAAAAAAAAA wdym the afro is fireee
2:17 the clips gang
9:27
Correct me if I am wrong, but. This isn't even about FNAF anymore. This game literally has nothing to do with Freddy, or the previous entires apart from it being a sequal to Security Breach.
Knitting my first pair of socks watching a classic: CORYXMIMICC 🤭
Entoanthepack brings back so many memories. I used to love watching him play little big planet 3 custom worlds I swear. What a flashback
How much ad revenue you need 🤦🏻
35:40 wow he’s really good at that puzzle
i love that when you cant move at a point of a chase scene and the monster gets close to you it means that you beat it and some kinda environmental hazard is gonna take the monster out at least for now
33:38 cory and my instincts swapped bro, i heard the music and thought "Nnno!" and cory kept the cautious curiosity 😄
24:47 its the freddy charger sb part over again
13:02 deadpool reference, to the betting event about who dies
No way i got jump scared by the sound “waow”
2:20 cooking with kenshin back???

Ok I’m ready for jump scares 2:30

You are playing things that is from evil, from the enemy, stop putting this things on the web, you are just leading many to the wrong side, the enemy side, do you think Jesus will be playing this? No. Are you a Christian? Please stop, if you want to do Gods will stop doing things for gain money doing evil. I know maybe you will not stop, but is my part to share with you, that you are precious for Jesus, you deserve putting your mind in things that help you to grow not to destroy you. You are being deceive by the enemy. I’ll be praying for you.
Hey cory, you should react to some of the fnaf songs out there, especially as a long-term fnaf fan. Like LT music or CG5 ect.
33:59 😂 he Tickled me and said I did the thing that I was supposed to do I can't move omg ❤😂😂

school
Are you a sinner? Can I tell you something wild?  You’re not broken because of what you’ve done — you were born into something deeper. Just like you didn’t choose your race, you didn’t choose to be born with a fallen nature. Adam sinned. You know Adam and Eve — the first humans created by God — and from them came the entire human race. At the Fall the seed of sin was planted, and that brokenness has been handed down to every one of us — right down to me and to you.  That emptiness, the confusion, the shame — I felt it too.  I grew up Christian, but I walked away from the church. I got proud, decided I knew better, and did my own thing. I pushed against authority, grew bitter toward the church, and tried to fix the ache inside with my own choices. Instead I fell into depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. I numbed myself with alcohol, edibles, THC drinks, weed, and vapes. Nights became filled with panic attacks and hallucinations. I thought I was incurable.  One night I was alone in my bedroom, crossfaded, and everything caught up to me. I felt like I was on the edge of a cliff — no answers, no peace. My stepfather prayed a simple prayer over me, asking God to show me the truth whether I believed it or not. In that moment something changed: I felt God’s presence so strong I couldn’t deny it. It was a real encounter — a fresh wind filling my body and soul.  That day I started digging. A series of events and a rabbit hole online led me to a preacher’s testimony on YouTube. As I listened, the Gospel began to make sense in a new way. I was terrified at first — “Does this mean I’m going to hell?” — but the truth set me free.  I learned that Jesus lived the perfect life I could never live — and He lived it for me. I learned that we’ve all earned a debt through sin, and Jesus is the only one who paid it. He didn’t come to leave us where we are; He came to rescue us from what we are. The Gospel taught me that I don’t have to pretend to be perfect, because He already was perfect on my behalf.  If you’re reading this and you carry that same heaviness — the shame, the guilt, the emptiness — hear me: you were not born beyond redemption. You were not made unlovable. The emptiness you feel is evidence that you were made for more — for relationship with God. He meets you right where you are: in your mess, your questions, your fear.  There’s no neat, instant fix for everything — recovery, healing, and growing faith are a process — but there is a beginning point: faith in Jesus and the willingness to let Him do what you cannot. If you want someone to pray with you, to walk with you, or to point you to resources and a local church that truly cares, say so. I’m living proof that God still shows up in the middle of our worst nights.  To anyone who’s been told you’re beyond hope: that’s a lie. To anyone who’s been told you need to earn God’s love by cleaning up first: that’s a lie. Jesus paid the debt for the life none of us could live. He loves you right now — today. If you want to know how to start, comment “I’m ready” and I’ll pray for you and tell you how I began.  You are not alone. You are not beyond repair. There is hope — real hope — and it met me when I needed it most.
hey cory, do a cooking with kenshin cory, do it now cory. NOW.
Hey cory, i really enjoy watching your videos and i recommend that you should play stay out of the house by puppet combo. I think you played the prologue a few years back in the gas station. I think you’d love it

Watching Cory really is the only thing that grounds me, it’s like therapy completely takes me out of where I get stuck in my mind. I’ve been here since 2014 and no matter how old I get I don’t think I’ll ever outgrow watching Cory. I’m 25 now and hope to one day be showing these videos to my kids.   It’s nothing but love and respect for you big dawg

I LOVE THE INTRO NEVER STOP THE WINDOWS OPENING
Trying to keep up with stuff. From what I understand he's been traveling the world and promoting his manga. Blessing his steps and protecting him along the way. Seems like the enemy has been coming at him in several different ways since he's returned. And you're succeeding especially in the world as a person of faith. The enemy will always keep attacking trust me I know. I was a fan of coryxkenshin because me and my son were not together anymore and after years we were reunited and his videos brought us together we are very Christian loving people and it's hard when he misses videos because my son and I are separated once again. So I want you to know that although I have tears for the fact that I miss both his videos and my son because it brings back so many good memories. I write this with a heavy heart because every one of your videos Cory, remind me of the best time with my boy. You have no idea how grateful I am for your content because it brings my heart close to my son's even though we're far apart. I've cried many times just because the Lord is amazing and your content, your walk with Christ, your personality reunites me in my mind and heart with my son Abraham. Even now I weep for missing him as he is states away from me and people cut me off from talking to him. But I pray for you and will be very grateful when you return. Please don't let the enemy overtake anything in your life, because you are a light in this dark world. I'm 43 and you inspired me to do so many great things. We love you man. 😢❤. These two samurai will always be waiting for you.   Sincerely, Rick (dad) and Abe (son)

19:10 I was able to figure it out within a few moments (not trying to sound pretentious i promise Love you kory) but basically, the big piece is filled with that liquid (looks hot) to fill the tubes and reach that tub up at the top. So all the tubes have to connect to do that but those extra parts have to be turned as well to make sure it doesn't flow out wrong and not work properly (if that makes sense)
ITS THE FREAKING MIMIC AAAHHHHHH
Yeah, where is cooking with Kenshin?

Hey Cory, I hope you enjoyed with THIS VIDEO GAMES PROGRAM! Such as your new project for the game that I will share with you soon as possible as well for the roughlike game of version. Download the Cult of the Lamb and play it. Thank you!😉😉😁😁
First off, I hope you're doing well — mentally, physically, and spiritually. I know you always say you're taking care of yourself first, and I respect that deeply. Still, I just wanted to let you know... I really miss you.  Your videos have been a huge part of my life. Whether it was a tough day or just one of those “meh” moods, your content always brought a genuine smile to my face. Your humor, your faith, your energy — it all feels real, and that’s rare on the internet. Watching your videos isn't just entertainment — it's a comfort.  I completely understand that you need your time and space — everyone deserves peace, especially someone who gives so much to others. But if you ever feel up to it, just know that a whole army of Samurai are still here, waiting, supporting, and hoping you’ll upload again. Not out of pressure, but because you make our days better just by being you.  Thank you for everything you’ve already done. Whether you come back tomorrow or next year — or even if you decide to step away for good — I’m grateful for the impact you’ve had on my life and so many others.  Take care of yourself, King.  With respect and love, A loyal Samurai
Real ones here 👇❤

He definitely got active 💔
Masterpiece.
Ethan said
Buns
Drop a like if you agree.
Corey in the game there was numbers like in the boxes and stuff. I think that’s where you have to put the code in.
The effort you put into this shows.
i like how he references Freddy from Security Breach at 7:30 and 8:22. "Knickknacks and doo-dads."
Solid.
19:54 now you know an applebee’s cost way more than $25 bucks😂
Dark deception five now
Welp time to start rewatching what we were blessed with

FNAF Secret of the Mimic actually was confirmed to take place in September of 1979, so calculating the inflation since then, the gift certificate would actually be worth an estimated $110 today. Still not worth it tho even in this economy lol

"And i dont wanna over promise, cus we know what happens when i do that." I've been watching Cory for years now, and even after he's been back for a while, I can't help but laugh at the jokes about him vanishing.

You don't deserve this man, you’re such a great guy and people try to take advantage of you. Just know the real ones know who you really are and love you deeply. You have helped me so much since I've been watching you and you truly do deserve a break for however long you need it to. Please don't feel warranted to come back when people like her try to do things like this to you. We all love you Cory, you are the goat of YouTube, you've always been in your prime and a great person. We all miss you bro. ♥
Coryxkenshin is back yay🎉🎉🎉 lol
Cool
We’ve seen this happen in the nfl and nba many times before, some girl falsely accuses the player of SA or VA and it’s, more often than not, false. I’m sticking with Cory no matter what happens. We love you Cory. And that will never change
This was my first coryxkenshin vid and i think im starting to like this guy.

" Guys I don't wanna hear any jokes in the comments saying oh he's really good at that puzzle! - WHAT THE FREAK OPEN UP! [Jerks it faster]
First Cory vid I watched
Yo cory My man, reacc to the video of dark decepcion
Sorry I kinda stopped watching and just got back, what is happening? Is he ok?
Cory is best YouTuber
The nooo when the elephant got got me laughing hecka hard😂
Hey Cory- from one Christian to another, God I telling me that you should steer clear from these kinds of games! We need to be careful of what we are consuming! Anything that isn't light is not of God! We are made in his image
38:53 bro made a new song
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤
❤
he had a chicken and it died
Cory “well he’s really good at that puzzle” sees Jackie “WHAT THE FREAK” destroys the generator
23:21 LOOK AT YA DUMB AHH
10:50 over a month of laughing at it’s timeee to opeeen the DOOOOOOOOOR 😭😭
Can you do a Cooking with kenshin video and if so can you try fryed ice cream plz
Damn coryxshin what's up@23! Brodie💯
Hey bro i watched since i was at elementary , nahh i miss you watching btw im from Philippines
Cory is the ultimate FNAF king!
23:17 look at your dumba….
Coryy, I love your videos and you ❤ you should definitely play, “The bed we made” it’s not a horror game but more detective and story game. I’d love to see you play it🎉
OH MY GOD, I DIDN'T FUCKING NOTICE THE OTHER VAN, BUT YEAH, COWORKERS WERE SENT THERE TOO AND THEY DIED.
Ohh, after watching Markiplier, I didn't know you actually controlled the driving. Markiplier kept it centred on the centre line, which was kinda stupid and unrealistic anyway and I assumed it was a cutscene and the game was doin' that. Obviously, you're meant to keep right of the centre line!
A horror game isn't meant to be bright.
Playing horror games at 2 in the morning is the best, actually.
THE WINDOWS 95 STARTUP SOUND WAS NOSTALGIC AS HELL
seeing the other youtubers he mentioned reply in the comments warms my heart. W Cory
cory im in
cory i don't have a telelgrame acon
i love you cory this the best you fav man you don't know how much this means to me

THE RUN
ITS THE FUCKING MIMIC
33:55 yall know that sound… ;-;
Cory!! You should play a game called “detention”!!
Follow the pipe there's a switch 💯🔥
Hey Corey, I think you should download rec room and play Corey X Backrooms. There is a secret way that you will see if you do it. It’s really sad. I’ll tell you a little bit about it when you download it. I hope you do 😔 but anyways😅 you’ll see before you click play well no because it’ll be two so could play and then if you stay in our room in the second room, you’ll see a big giant curry and while you’re listening to the music, he will say she learned her cheeks in my mouth but anyways😅 yeah while you’re listening to the music, look on the side duck down pause anyways you duck down and just crawl over there. You’ll hear some sad music and then you’ll see something that you don’t like it’s super sad for me cause I thought that big Cory was Corey but then when I checked the spot, it felt like a day. I can’t play rec room no more but anyways😅 yeah you should get rec room then search that up and then you’ll see it been like five years since I played rec room after that incident that I saw but you should go get and see it for yourself. I know you’re always playing different games oh, and I know you break the fourth wall. But I am a reactor and I don’t even have. I didn’t send any of a funny videos. I always pretend I do I don’t. I don’t have discord if I did I still don’t have TikTok that’s why I never did one and it’s my mom’s account. My name is Erynn but yeah Corey you should play it. I’m really sad for you, buddy.😢.
Cory a fan of Beyoncé? ‘Upgrade U’
10:48

Corey you know, I love you
CoryxKenshin, you need to post again what are you doing?
He’s really good at the generator puzzle😂
😂😂😂
cory tho with the hair 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Edwin is a broken man. He had a son named David and a wife named Fiona. Edwin got the company named Murray’s costume manor from his dad when he passed away. Fiona died first while in fall fest, where she died in a fire. Edwin then made the mimic, a robot skeleton that can fit into any suit and can mimic characters or people. Edwin treated the mimic like it was his dead wife. Later Edwin’s son David was having his birthday party. Everyone hid in a room but when the mimic went to get David his ball rolled onto the road. David who loves his ball went to get it but got hit by a car. Edwin, being very sad transferred m1, aka the mimic program the copied Fiona into a computer and made m2, the same endo skeleton that would copy David. After awhile, Edwin got so mad that the mimic kept copying his dead son David that he decided to be the living crap out of it. Meanwhile Edwin’s company failing. His employees were leaving left and right. While in his office, the mimic made an explosion somehow in Edwin’s office and killed Edwin. M2 now wonders around the facility waiting. You in secret of the mimic is named Arnold where fazbear entertainment sent you to mcm to recover the blueprints of m2 with a device called the data diver. You destroy a bunch of animatronics worn by M2 such as Jackie, the clown in the video. Big top, a character that resembles music man. And Dollie, a recycling robot. In the canon ending, you’re supposed to give the blueprints back but you don’t. M2 the. Chases you down and the. Crashes your van. M2 steals the data diver. Turns out, M1, the mimic program copying Fiona mimicked dispatch about halfway through the game trying to get the blueprints to repair M2. Hope the brief explanation helped you understand the lore of the game and characters!

JUSTICE FOR KORY HERE 👇
23:56 thats fs ao oni innat jawn
Cory it been 1month sins u haven’t posted
I didnt even know Cory was dating anyone until I saw the most recent comments...Will Cory make a video on this I'd say a strong maybe based on the other scandal with his hair getting done etc. But this one seems like a much bigger deal, im sincerely hoping you're innocent cory cause it seems like all the good ones keep hitting that controversy and I strongly believe you would never go that route. Still...much love and support until then 🫶🏽
I never switched up Cory❤
HE CAME BACK
10:53-11:09 had me WHEEZING 😭🙏
I like that when he says don’t make any jokes of I’m good at jorking it then suddenly goes fast when Jackie enters the room💀
Every time there’s a funny clip, I’ll tag it here.
36:35 “dont wanna hear that ‘hes really good at that puzz-‘ *jackie shoots her arm into the room* *cory proceeds to complete the tug machine faster than you blink*
Give me a Bar
Where is Sam The simson
The fact that some of yall switched up on him WITHOUT proof that proves some of y’all aren’t true samurai.
Cory please finish playing night of the consumers I’ve been waiting a long time
JESUS CHRIST IS COMING BACK SOON. TRUST HIM, REPENT, AND WALK WITH HIM ALWAYS. RESIST THE DEVIL AND SUBMIT TO GOD! HE LOVES US ALL SO MUCH! MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL TREMENDOUSLY IN THE MIGHTY NAME OF JESUS CHRIST I PRAY, AMEN HALLELUJAH!
and the worst thing is that how the hell yall think cory would be acting like that if he had to step out of the channel a couple of years bc his aunt died and he had a break to cry it out and try to enjoy his life also. the time he comes back these dumb ass mfers trynna 'cancel him' like bro he js came back from enjoying and crying his aunt out tf did he do 😭
these mfers new shogun tried to comply and switch that the samurais locked in so much thta it got debunked in less than 24 hours and that even she said that it was fake and someone helped her  man jawbronis dumb frfr  thse new ppl trynna cancel everyone.
No matter what the allegations are if I like the YouTuber I’ll watch them no matter ehat
0:09 he is not being like those main characters in a horror movie
Now bro never gonna come back
G.O.A.T
Channel finna be real active- goes to Paris... and gets canceled again
25/100 videos I’m worried that he is not going to complete the streak
Rapist

Cory literally won against the allegations without saying anything, that just shows how strong our shogun
35:54 he got much faster when seeing that…
Who here never switched up on Cory
As a person who uses to be obsessed with  fnaf gameplay but then slowly faded out i decided to step back in and it feels good again like that nostalgic feeling ❤😅😅❤

Cory I love you 😏😫❤️‍🩹🩷🩷💅🩷❤️‍🩹😸🙏🏾🙏🏾
Where’s momo
Cory is still the only YouTuber I’ve found that puts anything Jesus related into videos. That verse at the beginning made me really happy, so so sorry about the allegations but I’m on your side! There is only one true judge in life and that is Jesus.
I need “You into that?” Merch now😂
You're my goat coryxkenshin i love your videos man love you brother
Nah there is no Roxanne wolf you got too freaky when you saw her 😭😭💀💀
Ig he overpromised😔
The Roger kid?
Cory I just wannna say if you decide to leave after the stunt that lady pulled and the hate from some of these “fans” I completely understand because first of that lady had no right to come for you like that and then your so call “fans” which I feel like it’s really THE NEW FANS!!! That started sending hate your way without even hearing your side I really hope you tackle that lady trying to frame you and ruin your image Because what she did is SICK but a lot of us still love you man and it’s all love that were sending your way block out all the negativity.❤🫶🏾

Cory you have been proven innocent bro even before that I knew you wouldn’t do anything of that sort I love you brother❤
Bro has definitely had practice with those puzzles

i never switched up my goat
on my first account I was subscribed since 2018 love your videos man keep it up
The people who switched up on cory looking real stupid rn
Even if they were fake bro I came RIGHT back🗣️
Why does that look like security breach ruined the thing that Kathy uses?
Bro you need to sleep why are you waking upto 2:00am in the morning it's bad for your health you should know that
i will forever love cory and his content. never switching up on him for anything because i know they lied anyway. im sorry this is happening to you and you were falsely accused of something. Being famous means rumors will be spread at some point, and people will try to cancel you, but Gods got your back Cory. and so do we ❤
This game reminds me of security breach

Yess kept it up cory💖
Cory ur ex is lying about u and making allegations, she admitted it was fake tho but some people switched up on you and idddnt see that she admitted it was fake so can u make a video and explain ur side to clear things up ❤
22:44 didn't cory say thats his worse fear
don’t worry cory, i’m on your side
Bro, my parents just let me get YouTube back and then I learned about the allegations. “I JUST GOT BACK ON THE PLATFORM!” Same
Sorry cory i was doing to much 2:36
Ppl cried, panda lied, mimic died, Cory up 5‼️
I miss you Cory and I wish you posted again and after my dad passed you were one of the only people that kept me happy ❤😁😢
Ian going no where Cory, im behind you. It’s two sides to every story and the truth lies between the two. I may not know you personally but I know yo character bro and the integrity you have as a man. Besides, let me remind everyone you’re innocent until proven guilty and the reason they made the law that way. If he’s proven to have done something, I’ll deal with it then but i’m not gone turn my back on bro without even hearing him out first.
cory i hope when you come back that you take a break if you need it i really hope it was a lie i’ve been watching you most of my life i hope she’s just a manipulative person who got hurt because she did something and you dropped her ❤️
Bros getting a DUI fr😭
Just know, you’re not alone Cory.
Bring back Spooky Scary Sunday😊
Nah Cory u dirty
I feel so bad for Cory because he has to deal with you dumbass people and believing he was a bad person to his gf. Yall are weird
I wish you too be pertected
Cory perfect yourself please people say the allegations are bad but I am always by your side love coryxkenshin I am loyal to my favorite I will pray for you
We know you didn’t do it Cory anyone who switches up only from hearing her side was not a real one I have been watching for who knows how long and I know Cory is innocent
cory why
Cory we love u we know those allegations are fake ur ex is just bitter and wants to be relevant
I hate tht bihh I feel like she saying rs now bc Cory is famous why not speak up 5-6 years ago when he had like 3 mil why now all of a sudden you wanna come out abt sthing thr happened years ago tht prolly ain't even Tru I feel like she only talking bout it now bc he has like 15 mill subscribers and a bigger audience for her to gain attention even if I'm wrong and it's true I still will love Cory and watch all of him I've been watching for 8 years I'm not gonna let ts stop me loving his content us samari will push trough ts as a community and a family❤️‍🩹
I need to hear both sides tbh but I’m still with cory
Yall need to chill out two videos now people don't know how to act 😤
Guys the allegations are fake. She later came out and said it was fake and that Cory never cheated on her or 🍇 her they just had an on and off relationship and she just wanted an apology.
Cory wake up they lying on your name
CORY SOME GIRL IS TRYING TO GET YOU CANCELLED SHE IS SAYING YOU SA HER AND PLAYED HER
Hey Cory ima need you to drop a video man…..these allegations getting bigger by the day
We all know the alligations aint true
It’s not fair bro Cory didn’t sa anyone he’s was just a bad boyfriend and it happened like 8 years ago
Coryxkinshen we don’t care about them allegations POST
bro she lied and admitted to it, i have proof. yall are weird fans for believing that. Do you honestly think CORY out of all people would do this, you have to sit down and ask urself after watching him basically grow up would he do smth like this, not only that but the story didnt even sound believable. this is weird as fans to side against him over something so obviously fake.
yall are fake as hell bruh 🤦‍♂️, she literally said he never did anything to her
Real one here!
All of you who switch up without hearing Cory’s side are wrong for that
29:28 talking bout roger frfr

Dude, I’m a type 1 diabetic and LOVE fruit!! But I rarely get to eat it because of the sugars, that are, yes, natural, but still sugar. So it makes it shoot up quite high.  But I’ve never known eating fiber before could slow the sugar intake!! I definitely wanna try this, it could be a game changer so I could eat more fruit. Mostly cantaloupe, lmfao

Should have not cranked Jackie's box you should have kept going
anyways heres the fnaf lore: the lore of fnaf is starts somewhere in 1937-39 when William Afton lost his wife somewhere before these years and gone mentally unstable and made a circus world, baby's circus world which he closed just a bit later just after his daughter Elizabeth gone too close to circus baby and was scooped into herself and crying child saw that getting traumatized, somewhere around the same date William closed circus baby and met Henry Emily befriending with him and opening Freadbear' family dinner in which they used spring lock animatronics which could be used also for humans to wear but it was risky since spring locks could go off and kill the person in suit which crying child saw once too as well what traumatized him even more and his older brother Michael Afton started bullying him and in his own b'day shoved his head in freadbear's mouth causing crying child to squirm and cry causing the spring locks go off and Freadbear biting off half of crying child's head what caused Freadbear's family dinner to close, some years later opened one small place which Henry worked on alone without William causing William to get extremely mad and catch daughter of Henry, Cassidy outside of the building and then killing her and leaving her body at the dumpster behind the building as puppet went outside and laid besides the body due to being too broken from the rain and causing remnant from Cassidy to inhabit puppet and posses her some more of deaths happened in that building due to Williams rage and it led the building to close, some years later in 1987 Henry opened a new Pizzeria with animatronic ideas that was made while he was working with William which made William mad again and he went to kill kids in new pizzeria again this time stuffing 5 bodies of 5 kids in classic withered 5, freddy, bonnie, chica, foxy and golden freddy. new pizzeria closed again because William rigged the security system in toy animatronics causing them to attack parents of kids and Mangle bitting off half of head from a night guard causing the most famous bit of 87, few years later there was opened pizzeria once again with now withered animatronics being fixed but being stuffed with remnant of kids that was killed causing them to go alive during nights, at that very same time Michael Afton starts working there and due to looking like William was target of animatronics, later on Mike Afton was fired for illegally interrupting in animatronic systems and stinking, some time later in that pizzeria William takes apart animatronics setting souls of kids free as they corner him in "safe room" where personal was dying and he in hopes to get saved by his trustworthy suit of yellow rabbit, spring bonnie, puts it on he dies from spring locks going off so after that pizzeria burns down as William with it damaging the suit and corpse of his, yet some years ago before it all Michael went into already closed circus world of circus baby and died there from hands of ennard and getting scooped his organs out so ennard could use body of Michael as suit, once he got out he left body but remnant have bring Michael back to life as he decided to put end to his father's deeds he gets job in pizzeria from naf 2 which goes before naf 1, and Michael was fired after interrupting into animatronics system and stinking since he's corpse of a human, so he decides to go in pizzeria from naf 1 and he gets fired for the same exact reason, and so after many years somewhere in 2015 william was found within remnants of once to be pizzeria and 2 guys buy all stuff that was found there and made a horror attraction, Fazber's Fright, and Michael gets job there facing his father as now only urging to kill animatronic with phantoms as ghosts of the past, after it the horro attraction burns down with all the phantoms and remainings of animatronics setting kids who once possessed animatronics finally free and rest in heaven, and some years later like 2016-18 Fazber entertainment with Henry Emily as head of it selling new pizzeria and financing it as Michael Afton buys it and gets in all animatronics, which are Scrap baby, his sister Elizabeth, Lefty, a trap for puppet who's possessed by Cassidy, scraptrap, his father William, and molten freddy, remnant of ennard, and so after doing so he lures everyone under the pizzeria into specifically made to entrap every of these, Henry emily starts "termination protocol" setting on fire entire place and burning down everyone with himself as Michael stays there to die with his father and sister, then somewhere in 2019 Fazber entertainment releases VR game where they put chip from scraptrap as William survives as form of virus that gotten in head of the tester of the game

6:45 I HAVE A THEORY!!!!!  So basically in security breach we remember how Cassie had a data driver, right? The one he’s holding is the one Cassie’s dad gave her and Arnold is Cassie’s dad
CORY PLEASE PLAY SAIKO NO SUTOKA AGAIN🫸🏾🫷🏾🫸🏾🫷🏾🫸🏾🫷🏾
Idk if this is off topic but am I the only one who didn’t know that Roxy was actually mangle from five nights at Freddie’s 1 or 2 something like I jst found out when my friend told me
Game suggestion: there’s a gun in the office
Soooooo….. Cory?… it’s been 6 years since you played Sekiro episode 1….. you think you can continue?
38:37 the og jump scare sound from fnaf security breach
i love games that are set in the 70s or 80s that have futuristic undertones
we didnt get the " ARE YOU READY FOR FREDDY "
Cory wheres thats Wukong game💔 we saw u clocked it🥀
THANK YOU FOR PLAYING THIS!
man you need to make the Bible verses last longer I can't read it in time
23:20 caught me off guard😭
Corÿyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy hi
I absolutely love your videos cory! they make me laugh so much and jump in my bed because of the jumpscares, but i genuinely enjoy watching your videos. keep it up and don’t stop what you’re doing. love you cory/shogun❤
Bro started goonig to Jackie 😭😭
My kid watches this.  I didn't expect Cory to pull out a racist card "i'm black" for kids video.  This guy got too comfortable.
16:07 that's OK! Happens all the time
ever since monty bro does not like alligators it seems😭
10:50 bro they decided they hated cory so fast </3
22:33 only the ogs remember corys biggest fear ❤❤❤😂😂
25 buckarunies 😂
I was trying to figure out why the lala sounded so familiar and it sounds like the banana splits song
Fusionzgamer mentioned
i started watching you when i was 12-13 now im 19 and sitting here and watching you while eating pizza
23:09 Look at ya dumb ahh-
39:06  at 2x speed sounds like a chainsaw
29:18 PROCLASSGAMER!!! he used to watch you play Evil Within back in the day while we were on Skype coming up with new FNAF theories 😅 that just brought back some good memories.

I like how the new FNAF games are going from a point and click to rom around and chase like Corey said like alien isolation and outlast
i thought scott was done is this just a game he waas already working on
Definitely getting Chuckie-Cheese vibes😂
4:42 guys it’s not for a $25 certificate, Arnold literally says they threaten to dock his pay and repo his truck 😭

To anyone who's suffering depression, anxiety, insomnia and other mental health problems, you are not alone. I feel you. You are so brave. You are doing so well. I'm proud of you. I'm sending you a virtual hug ❤ what helped me get out of that dark spiral was journaling and mindfulness from Shift Your Mind by Alexander Brooks. The anxiety that used to control my whole day barely shows up now!🙏❤
To anyone who's suffering depression, anxiety, insomnia and other mental health problems, you are not alone. I feel you. You are so brave. You are doing so well. I'm proud of you. I'm sending you a virtual hug ❤ For me, it wasn’t therapy or meds that helped the most — it was reconnecting with myself. I started using the exercises in Shift Your Mind by Alexander Brooks, and it made me feel human again. The anxiety that used to control my whole day barely shows up now! 🙏❤
I think the YouTuber he was talking about was xxProClassGamerxx
Cory's Generator starting skills are remarkable
Cory singing Beyoncé 😂
This is the second ever video I watched of this guy's channel and honestly, Cory might be my new favorite content creator! Keep up the good work and no need to overwork yourself! 🥰
25:10 is too funny 😂😂😂

35:47  Cory: I don't have enough mouse space for this Also Cory:
29:14 xxproclassgamerxx. he had a pet chicken named “Chica” that passed away the, he stopped uploading videos altogether
Ngl a boxy jump scare would scare me bad
“Yeah I’m black I’m not gonna sit there and let you power up” is wild
30:08 Corey's words are not wording
bro still had his headphones on kinda funny ngl
19:42  “Arnold grow a pair” is crazy
He grown so much hair I feel like I am older
Cory cab you play spiderman 2? Its reallly fun even tho i think the spiderman 2018 story is a tad bit better. But apiderman 2 gameplay improves in sooo many ways. And its just so hype, pleaseee my man
DLIVEEE
10:40, 24:56

9:29 Oh man...
17:56 imagine theyre looking at this and they add his idea to a game 😂
Did anyone else notice dispatch was the same voice of the menu from fnaf 6
Is it just me or am I coming up with a stupid theory basically in security breach ruin Cassie said that her dad had something like the Faz-Wrench and here in this game, the main tool Arnold uses so I think that Arnold is Cassie’s dad is this stupid yes just something I saw when I first watched this.
Best in the world
It was funny when he said look at your dumb ahh
Jacky looks weird
35:45   39:30 just watch them lmao also 39:17 so does cory lmao

This game is dated in 1970 or 1975
So the mimic didn’t take care of his son because then he accidentally saw a car and then he got run over so so you’re so why you made that that under mimic that’s because that’s not gonna be son in the game
1:47 only OG’s know u was at school and my friend texted me bro corykenshin is back
39:43 why does Cory seem so…experienced with that motion

20:34 love how Corey threatened him with his worse fear 😂
Gorgeous
Cooking with kenshin
Unc was going crazy on that puzzle
U should really play the classrooms and upload the gameplay id love to see you play
I remember Delive I miss his content:( and his little big planet horror maps
Nice hair man
17:51 i mean #1 creat *does* exist, its litterally a creat with googly eyes
Crazy how every animontronic actually represents some of the ones in the other FNAF games. Like foxy and that cowboy pig, the bunny, the octopus for some reason reminds me of the dj from that one superstar FNAF game.
The YouTuber you’re thinking of Cory is xxProClassGamerxx
I thought that when u were driving from the start of the video I thought that someone was screaming for help but I realized it's from the car
Wait Cory’s pantry and fridge are beautiful omg I’m jealous
Aye Cory you really good at that generator😂
2:45 why he got so much Fiji water
Why he got so much Fiji water
25:09 “NOOOOOOO”

16:22 TELL ME WHY ME AND CORY SAID UPGRADE YA AT THE SAME TIME 😂😂
My birthday is today 🎉
How are your teeth so white?
I haven't watched the channel in like 2 to 3 months. I really like this. Also, where were the where are the dreads? Where are the dreads
Gooner mode activated
15::16 Okay. Why didn’t you put all the excess clearance before you give it him. It’s your technology right? And save a whole lot of time you gives do want the robot back afterall.
It's giving alien isolation 😢
29:35 facts
CORYXKENSHIN!!! You should try the game call Everything Kills You. You should try it.
Bro, were is momo at?

His hair looks so HEALTHY THO 😝
HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
17:50 bro doesn’t know about Trash and the Gang smh
23:39 and he waddled away waddle waddle walk
New fnaf is the purest piece of shit, just a pathetic copy of poppy. Just think, the game that everyone tried to copy before became a pale copy of another game.Maybe someone forgot, but let me remind you of the name of the franchise this game belongs to:  Five  Nights  at  Freddy's Now the question is, where is the fucking bear, where are the 5 nights, what the hell is this and why is it called this series????
I really REALLY need corys hair growth tips😂
Help i can't breathe
cory tapped in with lil b??? BASED
So are you ready for freddy
11:50 YALL THATS THE ELEPHANT FROM THE OTHER GAME (FREDDY FAZBEAR’S PIZZERIA SIMULATOR)
23:11 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
bro does not need that much fiji water
Love you my man but why your videos have more filler than one piece 🥀
xxProClassGamerxx is the one you're looking for.
Like this if u part of the smegma crew
its 25$ cause fnaf took place in the 90s meaning things like candy were only 50 cents and stuff
Play bone lab!!!!!!!
Hey cory i'm your biggest fan can I get a shout out

Fredbear's family diner poster spotted at 35:12
Bro went from god to godly 35:53
0:48 😂😂😂              Also I’m in California to meet my grandma              I was putting the lemons away when I got overheated and I passed out I 🤮 vomited and I had pretty big scrape on my elbow and knee           I’m ok
Cory should try vr horror games 👀✨
not all might
It was one of the elephants
PLAY DEAD AS DISCO
22:44 damn cory i thought u was a man of god lolll
We need SSS BACK
Videos be kinda dark on YouTube 😅😂
you would be getting a $200 gift certificate bc this takes place in the 70s and inflation
Personally, if I was in Arnold's situation, I'd get inside one of the mascot suits and have a nap. Arnold is sleep-deprived and his brain needs recharging for such dangerous work. Also, those suits are a great way to hide from the Mimic, in addition to probably being very soft and comfy.
Assuming that this is the 1980s $25 is worth like $100  dollars
Fnaf world
25:06 Cory's face 🤣
Go to sleep for you can get energy
I have diabetes like you g
35:55 had me dying the fear in this man's face every time
African elephant
Did I miss something?? This is more Poppy playtime than anything😭

"My name is Edwin i made the mimic"🗣️🔥🔥🔥
The first one:ALL MIGHT
25:09 NOOOOOOO!!!
Stopp why did he yell like that
Im new to your video and i love it
Cory never played Spider-Man 2 (SPREAD THE WORD) God bless y’all✝️.
22:30 real one know that this is corys biggest fear
26:03
To let you know it’s 4:33 AM Tuesday, June 24, 2025 the middle of the night and today’s my best friend‘s birthday my birthday is October 21, I was born October 21, 2016 and my best friend was born June 24, 2016 so fun went apart for five months

Cory is so funny 😂
Thing
30:17 what did bro do 😢
He was more focused on finding Roxy
22:30 cory tryna use his worst fear on the dispatch is fire 🙏😭
Instead of buying a million Fiji waters get a really good water filter for your home and buy a big water bottle. It’s the strat and may potentially taste better.
Hey cory, where are the spooky scary sundays?
Coryxkenshin I like watching your videos you're very positive

Great vid

Any samurai know what music he used at the beginning of the vid? 🙏🏽 0:17
34:34 34:35
the 13th game u played with that one dude...
I think I know why he doesn’t like the 🐊 any flashbacks from security breach …
15:10 it's in the 1970s
34:11 fnaf 2 pstd kicking in
35:13 it’s the Fred bears family dinner poster!
29:17 His name is Smike(I think), and the reason he stopped is because he got accused of stealing music from a small creator known as TryHardNinja, and of course because of the death of his pet chicken Chica.
“I don’t like that one..” LMAO
That’s a really nice job for CoryxKenshin
22:48 cory crank that Soulja Boy

37:17 this reminds me of poppy playtime
Soooo hey cory! you NEEDD to play among the sleep please

Corey, when you were walking down the hall, you didn’t pay attention to the posters and there was a spring Bonnie poster

1:11 I love you my guy …
I think the thing that you used to hack the main frames the thing that you get at the start that opens doors. It looks like the thing from Fnaf security breach ruin
Where is Roxy at you in to that 😂😂😂
This fire
he hit note really good for some reason😭😭 10:53
31:29 ayyy B'day reference
35:48 bro this goofy asl 😭😭
23:20 HUH
No one talking bout lore,ok I will  Anyone notice how Jackie's eyes go from a nice solid colour (forgot what it is) to a glowing yellow,who else has glowing yellow eyes?  THE MIMIC  Also when Jackie pops out the box, she/he (I honestly can't tell) sounds normal,but as the chase progresses their voice slowly goes deeper and more evil,who else copies voices but not exactly and makes it sound deep and evil?  THE MIMIC  He did that to Roxy   Lastly,if you listen to Jackie's jumpscare,we hear 2 things,Jackie laughing and weird machine noises,but if you ignore Jackie's laughter,you will realise that the machine noises are actually the same jumpscare noise as the one we hear in SECURITY BREACH,who have I been talking about the entire time who is from security breach?  THE MIMIC  We've already seen the Mimic,and it's obvious the animatronic Endo that can fit into any costume is the Mimic,it's in the name of the game,plus that's a perfect description of the mimic
could u do more try not to laugh plz I miss thoughts and like the hair
BRO LOOK FOR THE NUMBERS U PASSED THE 9 AND THE 5
CORY I JUST GOT NEW THAT YOURE BACK WHAT THE FLIPPERS
Why Arnold sounding like Overhaul

Love your hair coryxkenshin
25:09 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
Cory! My daughter is addicted to watching you and this type of content. I have blocked your channel and yet she finds a way to watch. I told her I don’t want her watching things with monsters ghost and demons. She says it’s ok because you pray for everyone. But it’s not. God will judge you based off the souls you brought to Christ. You are getting the children used to seeing evil and when they are faced with it in life they will think it’s nothing.  Change your content and save your soul and the souls that you are leading into darkness.  I understand you may mean well but what matters is how it’s received by your many followers. Pray and repent. With love a worried mommy ❤
Cory we all  love you but in this video you look really tired and I believe all of us appreciate that you stayed up to play and record but please get your sleep my guy❤❤❤
cory can you play bobs onslaught, FNF i miss when you played FNF i love it! ❤

Guys did Edwin make the mimic? Was it difficult to put the pieces together But unfortunately, something went so wrong And now he can't do anything, but sing this stupid song
I tell you what this is unforgiving. You have to admit the monsters get closer to you than necessary, the arms are right on you. These monsters are closer than any other game I've seen you play. That's insane, there's hardly any type of space given. Like the perception is in the face directly
39:21
Bring back the old days cooking with kenshin😢
Ok, so why is the game giving huggy wuggy x five night at fready’s x security breach? Or is it just me?
34:12 the way he stopped almost immediately as soon as he realized that it was the marionette music I cant 😭✋
cory once said "what year is it. in what universe are you risking your life for 25 buckaroonies."
25:08 STOP THE SCREAMING😭😭😭
I love Love, love, love, love, you
hell yeah
I already know this is Gunna be a w video

My favorite YouTuber.. in the flesh
25:10 Rip Cory this Ai is fast and smart only thing he could do was scream.
24:27 i was litarally screaming at the screen saying"cory no"
It's crazy how fnaf had evolved since the first game. I know it and others but honestly i remember freaking out from those cameras so at least now i can run lol
CORY, HOW MUCH FIJI WATER BOTTLES DO YOU HAVE IN DAT DAMN FRIDGE- Btw ive watched your vids since i was 4. I LOVE US VIDS

Hey Cory I was your biggest fan since 2021, i wish I can see you and speak to you😢and I had subscribed this video today❤
Will you have a cameo in fnaf2?
28:57 yo I used to watch Dlive gmods fnaf videos dawg
37:49 literally, how was he supposed to read that, I had to slow the video down 😭
He looks so goofy
2:21 2:30 2:35  Cory looks tired 😞
So is this a prequel to security breach? Cause the mimic is wearing the elephant costume like in the game with Cassie or whatever her name was
cutesy hair X33
Day 10 Asking to play Out of sight
Bro r*ped the generator before it even noticed.
2:44 now cory..WHY IS THERE SO MANY 😂😭

Did he just recreate the scream meme  in 25:06 ?😂
37:14 Animatronic Show dOowne 🤠

"COME GET YOUR BISCUT BALLS" ahh 37:00
25:10 best face ever
did someone say baker?
hi
The eye bags
Yo, it’s only endings gonna lie. You should do that when it is in F1 ending and you see the old animatronics I don’t know, but I feel like it’s a bad ending. You just have to see for yourself.
Yo Cory, you forgot a game Turbo. Dismount 2 just released back in 2024. You missed it
Hard to watch❎️ Hard while watching✅️
39:43 BRO CORYXKENSHIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING BEHIND THE SET UP😭
My name is Edwin…I made the mimic…it was difficult to put the pieces together….
We are so back
I was trying to watch this in class when it came out but my teacher caught me😢 so I’m watching this rn😂
lowkey this looks like a fan game 🔥🔥
9:02 how I felt about that clash royale ad
Hey Cory, I see you're into the bible. Here's something about luck (: Proverbs 16:33:"The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord." people cast lots (which is like rolling dice), the outcome is still in His hands. Nothing happens by chance. Edit 1: I hope this reaches him..
34:23 dang that junpscared and made me laugh😂😂
23:18 watchu mean🤨
25:44  brudder never told us sh- 😭 😭
Dlive is so peak
Why it's look like fulton
Play Batman Arkham shadow
Why you look like you haven’t aged I’m confused you look the same when i saw final nights 4 video at a hotel 😭😭😭
16:24 BEYONCEE
Number 1 crate erasure 😢
25:10 WHY IS THIS SO FUNNY??? (It's 3 am)
lowkey i've been so confused my ma put parental controls on my phone and it glitches a lot and delays videos so i'm lit seven days late vro 💔
CORY PLSSSSS FINISH DARK DECEPTION PLEASE
Randy he is the one hide your daughters and hide your sons RANDY HE IS THE ONE hide your daughters and hide your- finish lyrics
Bro really said "I don"t like that one" (Proceeds to look at a gator animatronic)😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
Bro sound like overhaul
💀 23:21
17:53  boxy boo bro boxy boo 😅😅
Fake ones here rn 👇
39:30 "Oh this one, Expert!"
14:54 To remind you only Arnold is doing is because they threatened him with cutting his paycheck and repo his ride. He’s been working 36 hours at this point sacrificing his much needed. That 25 gift gift card can’t make this better might as well be adding salt to the wound
Me at the bed at 11  35:48
Fusion mentioned. W Cory and fusion.
Knickknacks and doodads
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏😩
@CoryxKenshin can we please get a spooky scary Sunday really really miss watching those. 😢 makes me feel like a family horror night with the family

Jackie boy

25:10 The NOOOOOOO
Corey can u please play life is strange double exposure all i can say is your back as max you need to play it
CORY RUN FASTER ITS CATCHING UP TO US 😭
"Hair least important thing " lmao I felt that too 😅😂
Man this is super funny Cory is such a master at entertainment for me.
10:04 "I don't like that one" I think we all know why.   (If u don't know I'll give u a hint, security breach)
Cory busy diving like my grandpa lol
xxProClassGamerxx

25$ is 25$ 14:48
“My name is Edwin, I made the mimic” -Edwin Murray
i hate watching him completely miss the numbers for the door at the beginning
39:37 history repeats itself again
Cory knowing about dlive is actually insane to me I thought he was hella underground 😭
34:07 Sounds like music man from FNAF 2
Didn’t mention mark tho about old fnaf players shame 😊
The cutoff scream gave me whiplash I laughed so hard🤣🤣
Play The Ruin Cory
Btw $25 is like 250$ back then in the 60s (The time this game supposedly takes place in)
I just realized this is more terrifying then people think because of all of the animatronics and people we’ve seen in fnaf any of them could’ve been the mimic
Oh my god im uncovering so many secrets 🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯🥶🥶🥶
30:42 why is he hating on the hedgehog - 38:40 did they really reuse the FNAF SB jumpscare noise 😑😑

They shoulda just given us a gun in this game
35:48 this bit frying me
Cory i did some math and $25 back in 1979 was around 250 USD or more today

Bro broke up with his barber
Fnaf gone crazy with the animation BRO
Bro is good
I love Cory he's my first favorite youtuber:>
OMG I LAUGHED MY BUTT OFF AT HIM SAYING NOOOOO AT THE BEGINING LMFAO

Cory I have a question where’s Momo?
38:52 guys i think there might have been a switch
BACK IN MY DAY WE HAD TO WATCH HIS TRY NOT TO LAUGHS BEFORE TICTOK GOT BANNED SINCE THEY WERE THE NEWEST VIDS
Was it just for me that this game just kind of came out of nowhere? I saw no trailers, had no idea it was on the way, nothing. Compared to security breach, where I was hyping up for like a year, it’s just weird.
23:21 bro cutout his cussing 😭

2:27 MY EYES

0:30 Coincidence.

🐈‍⬛
This feels so weird to be a FNAF game. No point and click, we get voice actors for different characters immediately instead of it being down the line (for example: William Afton), and speaking of Afton, Afton is not in the picture (at least not yet, he always finds a way to still be involved), and (hopefully) more lore to figure out within the fine details, and no MatPat to go through the games details.
Steel wool might have just redeemed themselves
14:53 I guess some things never change in the fnaf universe lol, the pay will always be hot ass
35:47 the best clip in the whole video
the greenscreen at 33:02 felt personal
12:55 Bo remember’s his teenage years 😂😂😂
Omg so funny😂😂😂😂
Cory got the Afro back let’s gooooo
coryyyyyy play dead by daylight
39:26 oh this one expert *dies* 😂😂
The part where he tried to sing, and it cut off😂😂😂
no cause its so funny how they be hating on corys singing like even the cutout stopped when he was singing, and also love how he still has hatred for monty and other alligators
1:37  bro says, “The channel is about to get real active. I need you to strap in it’s summertime.” I’m strapped in so when’s the next video, buddy. Come on black samuri! By the way, I’m a samurai too love you, Cory!😂💀😭
Cory i love you I watch every one of your videos 😊❤️❤️
bro CoryxKenshin why is your hair like that all crazy and puffy and stuff?😂
He’s stocked with chef boy’r dee
Bro did anyone notice that the the animatronics in 10:39 is like the ones in the real game
Up down up down
bro do another cooking with cory 🙏
MY HERO ACADEMIA MENTIONED
OH WE ARE SO BACK
so far the best secret of the mimic video i've watched. Everyone else I've tried to watch seems to be too focused on the "fnaf" part to remember it's a game.
RAW. I meant awh ❤
23:22 that caught me off guard
35:47 WHY WAS IT SO FAST?!!
37:50 bro this feels like puppy playtime 🙏

I just realized that Jackies box song is "My Grandfather Clock." Aka Puppets music box song.
29:06 cory is talking about FuhNaff. The youtuber with the pet chicken named chica (for anyone who was wondering)
where is the video
Bro broke his mouse doing the generator 😂😂😂

14:50 FnaFSotM takes place in 1979 to answer your question.
Bro why you got a whole row of Fiji water it’s a scam😭
Another great content creator, Omar Sebali, dude was making fire content.
Cory mentioning dlive and antoin (forgot how to spell) is elite ball knowledge and a huge throwback
Samurai stand up

Did Cory really try to solve that puzzle for an hour?! Man
31:14 bro’s like Steph Curry when he found the deadspot on the floorboards 😭
10:54 -11:02 NOT THEM SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE CORY SANG (bros note was higher than my grades)

Forget secret of the mimic guys, we need Cory to upload DDLC part 2. Spam ''We want DDLC part 2'' in all his videos

Where’s my spooky scary Sunday… don’t make me come after your Cory…. I’m watching you and I know where you live….
Why am I the only who thought that this game was inspired by security breach because of the jumpscare? Nevermind.
Hey Corey, I a long time fan and I’m a really big fan of manga too and your manga interest me and I really wanna read it but the thing is I love to read and listen to music at the same time so is there anyway you can make a playlist for fans on Spotify or Apple Music? Or just make like a list so that we can read and listen I think they’d be really cool and a great way to promote the it as well thank you for your time! Also love the video you’re hilarious!!
Since secret of the mimic is out now and since might not be playing it myself and watch instead I have no idea where it's the right time for it. Can you help me?
Yooo fanaf 4 lore on the computer 🤯

33:24 that deadass was there when you first entered, you could even see the rubble as you walked into the room,  you literally just looked everywhere but that direction lmao.  I love/hate doing shit like that in games myself, but its a trip to be like "what the damn hell?"
cory da goat no cap
this more like poppy playtime
Real question, is this game worth it?
Matter of fact, Cory, I'm still subbed to Dlive, he's awesome!!
I literally got a bloody nose when I realized it was not fanmade and it was an actual new one that I hadn't heard about I literally got a bloody nose I am not joking
Always love the different bible verses you put at the end of your videos :)
7:31 fire reference from his fnaf security breach play through
One thing I've always appreciated and adored in Corys content has to be candid and unfiltered reaction to games, and that fact is making me wish I watched his playthrough first, even more so when his reactions amplify my own,,, it feels like I'm re-experiencing seeing it for the first time
Was having a bad day and I got tired so I I just turned on dnd and put on the YouTuber that never fails to make me laugh
You should see Amin too he is a good youTuber on fnaf
BRO IM FUCKIN 16 AND I USED TO WATCH ENTOAN SO FUCKING MUCH AND DELIVEEEEEE BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHAT I DIDNT KNOW YOU KNOW THEM

Unleashed this video how do you saw this video right now
i cannot believe cory mentioned entoan and dlive, this actually brought tears to my eyes, the memories of being a kid and watching them play games, and to have someone i still watch to this day mention them really just brought back good flashbacks and nostalgia. Thank you cory.
12:14 haven’t said that in years😂
I seen a shot gun by his door when he was getting a snack😐
Real ones here rn 👇🏻
So how’s momo

Cory's funniest moments(In My Opinion) 23:21😂
HOLY SHIT ive never watched you before, but mark and Jack haven't uploaded videos for this game so i decided to try your channel. I saw you posted kindergarten 2 and thought "i liked those games. i wish the creator would make a 3rd one." Just to find out it drops tomorrow?!?
23:33 bro was hauling ass top speed
14:55 I believe it’s in 1979. So after a quick search that would be roughy $110 dollars.
"Aye, where rocky at. You into dat" 😂

So uh about that box animatronic.... Yeah it's kinda already a thing
Okay...whos Murray and Edmond ? also; Helpy has a habit of dying really dramatically
I have a theory. Dispatch isnt a human, its mimic, and do has every pre recorded message and intercom voice weve heard through all the games. Its always been him.
Do you think this guy is the guy recklessly driving around in that midnight motorway minigame?
Play ruin and you'll understand some of the things that happen
Leith Pierre poppy playtime

First time watching him and now I see the hype 🤣
Video games: "Obvious yellow paint for non gamers." Modern "Gamers": still somehow misses obvious things because no yellow paint.
biology fun fact about bodies! did you know taht your body constantly adapt on what you eat? basically its like a potion, your body adapts to the potion so much that it doesnt have affect, so you gotta make it hit harder so it could affect your body
Switch?

Nah bro the crocodile at the beginning is gonna get coocked like monty
25:44  wym?? thats suspicious...
DLive mentioned❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹
I feel like they copied poppy playtime with the going back to a dead factory,cardboard cutouts that have voices,the bee joke poster that said BEE ur self,and the door that opens upwards that looks like the door in poppy playtime when the door opens and huggy wuggy comes out also doesn’t the ugly blue monster name sound familiar? It rhymes just like kissy missy and even when Cory made that joke in the beginning he said what next y’all are gonna put a face on a box and call it boxy….there is a poppy playtime character that is based on a box and his name is something like boxie or boxy….even Cory knows
Bro Cory we need a frickin sss wth is taking so long😠😠😠😠😠

Bro this is a fr poppy playtime copyright game bro…
I had to follow the pipe there's a switch 😎
Unc got a new word in his dictionary
Bro this is fr poppy playtime 💀
Am I wrong to say this game is devoid of anything new?  The original games were full of atmosphere, intended repetition and familiarity, they seemed to have a purpose. This looks like running around fighting off the next disposable lame thing, like the others they did.   Are people saying 'its the best because it's new?' extremely old, but new?  Imagine an updated version of an old style game. It would be so much better. No? X
schedule 1???
nahhh dlive is sum ball knowledge
When he said fusion I immediately said FUSIONZGAMER???
Bro I try to hit his high note and it’s that hard too 🥀🥀🥀
Cory "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-" 25:08
10:04 he said he doesn’t like the gator is this cause his hate for monty
The goat has returned. We can finally be free of brainrot, and anything else. We can now return to a time of peace.
MINECRAFT PT 6 CORY PLEASE I BEG PLEASE

“His slogan isnt sloganing”😭
Bro, it hurts so much when Corey doesn’t even pay attention to everything in the game. The combination for the padlock is around the room, but he’s not paying attention to the numbers. It’s sad.
Cory Can You play Babyandyellow
“idk if y’all know *entoan*” my ass over here watching salty bois videos like it’s my damn job
The game takes place in 1979 so $25 was like $100 back then

“Don’t let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity.” ‭‭1 Timothy‬ ‭4‬:‭12‬ ‭NLT‬‬
Nah, why did he say that in the intro 💀🙏
:)❤
Guess what how about you just play the game can you make some funny videos as well well you are playing video games
25:09 to 25:10, such astonishing words before death.
10:05 corys reaction to the alligator while being reminded of monty since he hates monty so much,he jst instantly said he doesnt like him😭🙏11:55 when cory was singing i wasnt rlly focused on him and was focused on the game when he was singing i didnt even realise it was him and they did him dirty😭
Cory! Cory! You won’t believe who they added to Dead by Daylight!
❤LOVE YOU Coryx Kenshin
25:08  what was that scream?😂
Spooky scary Sunday  pls 👇👇 😊❤❤❤
I heard Dlive and i got so happy
Dude, my name is Edwin, hearing it in a game feels weird 😂
25$ in 1979 would be 200$ today
OMGSH MY MANNNN😛
If this game was in real life I wouldn't be dead💀💀💀💀💀😔😔😔
CORY CONTINUE AT DEAD OF NIGHT
3 days late
DO FNAF RUIN
OMG ENTOAN THE PACK! he still makes content and so does dlive but they’ve taken less time recording and more on their lives. ENTOAN moved channels because Of engagement. I think it’s just ENTOAN now :3 I miss they’re lbp3 vids
I was literally crashing out on the inside I saw Cory miss numbers and codes for things 😭😭😭 it was somewhere around 20:16 something like that
"i told you you gotta put it in and turn it and let it load"
Me and my sister has ben watching your videos ever since you came out, and can't wait for SSS to come back
Cory the code was on the blocks
23:22 is so funny
11:01 really had me dying bro "OPEN THE DOOOOORRR-- 😨"

This game looks like poppy playtime but fnaf characters

"Real samurai’s dont compare me to anyone" they were both my childhood and I really can’t choose one over the other but it’s very different style content so I get that it’s not for everyone
28:46 I was 1 years old😂😂😂
Im really glad he doesnt speed run the game, the amount of fnaftubers that ruined the game for hundreds of people because they just HAD to speed run it made me and others pissed. I like how he took his time, its nice.
Ayo who else has that shirt? I got mine out immediately
When Schedule 1 part 2?

SELLING VALORANT ACCOUNTS (2 FOR 300$)
anybody else rub their feet, clap them together, and smile wildly knowing that cory finna make ANOTHER banger
Cory you must try misdemeanor
Dude even tho I wasnt there from the start, anytime my mom let me get some free time after chores. I would immediately hop onto your channel and watch your videos wether they were old or new, it didnt matter to me, Im just happy I get to see the shogun’s success😝🫶🏽
Those “mimics” he sees are actually hallucinations after not sleeping well its just my theory A GAME THEORY
The youtuber that Cory mentioned who stopped uploading after is pet chicken passed, this was xxProclassgamerxx. it's funny that Cory mentions him now as he has started uploading videos again 8 months ago, the most recent video is 6 months ago so it is  not as frequent as before but i find it a coincidence that Cory mentions him not long after his return to Youtube. He still has 200k subs too which is crazy after not being active for 9 years, good to see he will always have fans to return to.
PARTT 2222
ENTOAN AND DLIVE MENTIONEDDD I used to watch them constantly back in school, I really loved the little big planet worlds they did 😭
REAL CORY FANS CHECK INNNNN 👇👇👇👇👇

Wait, can I show you the best scary gamer I ever seen I’ll call you CoryxKenshin So slicer

Cory!! check out a game called South Of Midnight! Takes place in the Deep South and has lots of southern folklore, you’re on a quest to save/find the mom who was washed away by a flood. And you battle enemies with weaving abilities that’s almost like God Of War fighting style (in my opinion).  Hope it piques your interest and love your videos !!
0:48 all might!

The slogan is not sloganing made complete sense to me Cory 😂
Ts had me rolling 25:05
its my birthday 🎉
10:03 Still ain't letting that Monty beef go
14:53 well, considering that this game takes place in 1979, 25 bucks is the equivalent of like 110$, not bad (still  fazbear entertainment was predatory and manipulative at that time too lmao)
“Hey guys I know your gonna say I’m good at this puzzle then sees the animatronic and proceeds to finish it in 2 seconds”
Dlive!!! Omg😭😭😭😭😭😭
n
I think those numbers on the walls as blocks and random stuffs are numbers for the code cory 😭
CORY GOT THE CAKE
Dang, I cant remember but what was the song at 1:10 was it from Zelda?
FINNALY BRO HE DID THE MIMIC
"you have a regular person's name": I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess it's supposed to be short for Jackie-in-the-Box.   Edit: Steam achieve confirms it, guess I shoulda been more patient, lol
Fusion x coryxkenshin is crazy
Dude, we NEED cory playing ROBLOX, THE MIMIC!!! WHO IS WITH ME?!?!
Where is kindergarten
3fs and cory uploading same day is a blessing
25:10 NOOOOO goes hard
Dude $25 in 1979 is only $110💔💔
Did he change editors?
Cory quit edging us with kindergarten 2 man
0:47 Me trying to beat my tablet’s low power mode shut off sequence so I can charge it.

Finally not some indie game bull crap
H.e.l.p.e.r = Human Education And Language Protocol Element Router
This game reminds me of poppy playtime
used to pray for times like these
I really like the fact that you pointed out that you know why you lose interest in YouTube at the beginning, pressuring yourself to get through games you yourself might not really like. Or you just feel pressured to play at a faster pace really tires people out. I’m glad you can actually put it in the open that you understand your limits. So that we as a community can respect them. You’re doing great Cory
35:49 dang he's really good at that game
your really good at that puzzle
34:30 🤣
I know Roxy!😮
7:23 thank you for that useful information😭😭😭
😀
Hey! Cory, stop trying to crash ❤!
I wish we could get Cory to play the ruin series fnaf has
Man I love this guy's videos 😂😂
2:32 😂😂😂
1:45 this is funny to me😂
2:45 why does bro have that much Fiji water in the fridge how much did that all cost😂
Not the "you into that"😭
33:59 IMMEDIATELY having flashbacks
Cory the goat
Cory wear a wig for the next video and pretend like nothings wrong at alll
The nick nackes and doo dads reference from fnaf sb is crazy, only ogs remember
2:58 all the chef boyardees in the back is SO real cory
15:01 Cory money is money 😌😶
#1 on trending for gaming
Bro, your hair looks like you went in the dumpster and then your hair got all messed up. You haven’t took a shower for 30 days. Neither brushed your hair.

CORY PLEASE SKIP KINDERGARTEN 1 AND DO THE SECOND ONE IT COMES OUT ON LIKE THE 27TH PLSSS
5th day of asking for a second ep of schedule ( nice vid btw )
Blud got jump scared by a computer game in a computer game 16:01
Ooooh okaaay, this got a lil Poppy Playtime vibe to it!! 🥲🔥🔥🔥
Hi Corry, I think u should try "aloe water" it has fruit in it, I don't like the original one, but I think you might like the watermelon flavor or the pineapple flavor
yo cory since you did mention alien isolation are you ever gonna play it on the channel
25 dollars is crazy anyways loved ur vid cory
22:20 bro unlocked the Fazplug 🥀🥀
cory my guy. where's SSS? I miss it so much.
Bruh I know this is just a video game but if I were treated like that at the beginning with the dispatch guy I'd say f off and quit right there cause especially after a 36 hour shift without any sleep
I wish they would throw in some old school play style. I think the game on the computer is a cool reference  (even tho he only played a bit of it) just reminded me of the old fnaf. I get they are trying to evolve the scares and horror elements with time but the format is getting repetitive between a few diff series
this was my first time watching you and i honestly loved it
Hey Cory I love your book I hope you continue the franchise 🤗
Ay why cory gotta violate them generators 😭
This man playing everything but re4 remake
CoryxKenshin my best I think I’ve been a joke. I was gonna say it was my favorite and you are safe right now because I gotta have right now. I can never take it looking like trash. I’m like I’m on hello neighbors.
31:37 cory hitting that throat bass😂
Omgggg ~side note: your hair looks so beautiful!! 😍❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Me
35:48... if you don't know what this means, you're too young or too innocent
Big Fan of the FNAF games but this just looks like another FNAF inspired game/Poppys Playime. We need something like sisters location again
Learn how to play first ok?
“Go to bed it’s 3am” HOW DID YOU KNOW????
“Yeah I’m black I’m not gonna sit here and let you power up”😭😭
12:15  umm… maybe
25:08 the cut off 😭
Bro needs to play the rune dlc for fnaf security breach. I really want to see him play it!
25:05 I got it I got it (smiles) 3 seconds later stops smiling (panicking) the thing runs at him NoNooOoOoOoOoOoOo

10:53 I thought it was still the animatronic who sang the 'door' part until he mentioned he just wanted to help😭😭😭
Qm I the only one that noticed that the ‘executive’ one looks like the monarch symbol from Godzilla (2014-2024)
38:46
Oh yeah
I love you my glorious king
31:33 TF2 logo
38:23 I like how Cory is so nonchalant in the facecam but he flips the lever SO FAST
23:31 bro ran up on him like he heard him say dumb ah 😂😂
who else seen the code as soon as he said he dont know the code the numbers on the wall while checking lol
If I was being honest, this is feeling more like Poppy Playtime now than FNAF. Still, love your videos Cory
Can we please get a cooking with kenshin video
14:48 I think it’s like 1970’s
I'm here re watching this cause I like to  re watch his videos when I'm down but I wish everyone and Cory a happy father's day.  Cory if you see this could I get some wisdom if you can

“I’m putting cases on all of y’all.” Went over so many people’s head.
😂
39:57
Watch them make boxyy the main villian in the new game
Come get your birthday hug!! ❤❤🎉🎉
I GREW UP WATCHING ALL OF YOU GUYZZZZ HAHA
It’s like CoryxKenshin can read our mind
Hi Cory you have been my favorite YouTuber for around 8 years now and I’ve read monsters we make v1 I ordered v2 too and I’m trying to become a resident evil YouTuber any tips?
This my first time seeing secrete of the mimic playthru nd i knew this guy right here would do it at some point
2:45 daaaang he the fiji fanatic nah why he got so many this the type of thing you see in math problems "cory has 28 bottles of fiji water" ah dude lol
Who would win CoryxKenshin vs the whole world?
Dawko mentioned 😂
Honey shut up Kory posted
I’m lay hotline Miami for a true samurai
19:10 Cory you got plot armor…just finished this gameplay for my recording of part 1 and came to watch yours….and you ACCIDENTALLY solved it first try. Wow😭
Cory is so fine yall 🤭
I like toilet
If you’re felling froggy jump I was waiting for you to say that when there were all the costumes in that time
"Yeah im black im not gonna sit there and let you power up" fr tho horror movie characters are so dumb sometimes who sits there and waits for the opp to catch there breath and prepare to chase you no you just start running
Been here since 2010😵‍💫🤧
29:13 unc just play the game already, stop yappin bout the old days gramps.
🤣😂 (25:09)
Lesssgooooo
Prediction, the mimic is the phone guy, theres a voice ovelay if you listen closely😮
35:47
This reminds me of poppy playtime
You're gonna hear the jokes Cory, you might as well accept them when they come.
Man idc how many people call u cringy or old, AIMT NUN WROMG WITH BEING HEALTHY BROTHAH
PLAY DELTARUNE
28:17 you missed a collectbial
"You know what happens when i do that" got me dead 😂😂
The fact that he said'' wait wait wait.. we are risking our life for 25 bukaroos!?'' go me crying.
26:59 and I can’t stand people who pour the milk before their cereal catch this backhand 🙄
First thing I said as it started “is this another Monty the gator from fnaf” 😂
How much Fiji water do you haveeee!?
Who is going to tell him that there is a trash a I’m animatronic the UCN or the name is the trash gang
Cory's Bible verses always hit
24:58 I got it I got it …. AHHHHHHHHHH🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
12:11 he bring it back💀
Yeah, it used to be camera games. Now they make it these dumb games.
Cory do you remember cooking with Kenshin🤨
Damn ur 💨
I love ur vids and ur hair
Cory please dark deception
You’re the best YouTuber that I ever known you’re just like Fulton you’re the kindest YouTuber in the world
DLIVE MENTIONED OHMYGOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
35:50 oh hes really good at that puzzle
when being chase, never look back
Looks like he's really good at that puzzle 35:54
Does cory have perfect pitch? He kinds slayed
35:54 dang
Bro I got more scared than Cory did and nothin was happening😂
31:04 is where i left off (this is just for me to remember)
Stop playing, the hair is gorgeous.
Unc really risking his life for 25 dollars 😭😭
Just wanted to say the brightness being that high makes the game look not so great which means People who are just now seeing this game are gonna think it looks like poo probably set the brightness to 50 it is perfect for visual clarity and aesthetics although that doesn't really matter bro is quick with these video's but I shouldn't expect anything less from the Shogun himself                Also isn't is crazy how far back this game takes place? it takes place in 1979 just look it up it is kind of easy to find that information so it is just insane how Roxy seems to be something from Edwin kind of not exactly but you probably get what I mean and like just think how far apart Security Breach and this game are in the timeline cause 2029 is when that game seems to take place which is half a century apart crazy stuff bro
Legends from the start with Cory here 👇
I’m sad he didn’t do the bit where he would throw the gifts from the presents in the trash😔
yo tell me why the animatronics in this game remind me of poppy playtime ms Delight
the real horror of this game is inhumane work conditions
What are nic Mac’s
11:33  I was just thinking about this and not even a second letter Cory brings it up Honest seeing how it evolved from a 2D game to being in 3D and walking around is so amazing 😄
What does Cory has against gators 😭
39:44 Bro is a pro in that.. Sport.
Love the way Jackie moves its so cool like a slinky yet unbalanced however aggressive.
freddy fazbears took place awhile ago so 25 bucks is quite alot.
25:06 was the most funniest😂😂
ts scary bro
cory w da fro :O
35:24 Luigi mansion
Secret of why does cory have that much fiji water

Cory you should continue cry of fear
Hehehheheheh
He’s so funny when he called him a dumb a word at 23:18

Love yes sir do s
Hey cory how are you i subbed on your channnel because when i see your cool videos that make me to subscribe 😊❤
Copied poppy playtime honesty 😅
How is he so good at doing that with his hand so fast😂
I’m here sorry I was wait ❤😂😂😂
14:07 persona?
lol at 11:45
I’m sorry but the way Cory says “he had a pet chicken………..and then it died” HAS ME WHEEZING
Great gameplay
Scott really said hop on the game
23:22 CORY SAID THE A WORD….!!!!!
10:46 crazy how fast he went
25:10  NOOOOOOO-
CORY THE CAMERA HAD THE ANIMATRONIC IN IT….wait maybe not I may be slow…
Am I the only one confused how there’s security breach type technology when this was BEFORE FNAF 1..?
I'm so confused I'm stuck in a 0:04 second loop at the beginning and all I'm hearing is 'grab the crank brother 🧍‍♀️ OH MY 😱'
“Oh somebody in this one” Cory’s understanding and inference of horror game are on a different level bro😭😭
Jakie is the brother if the short and long arms guy in little nightmares
23:02 yeah i am black i am not gonna sit there let you power up
my last name is Murray
17:52 pretty ironic
I'm starting to hate this types of games but Cory is Cory
12:26  its not fnaf its poppy playtime atp
“My name is David” 🔥🔥🔥
23:08 “i’m black, i’m not gonna sit here and let you power up” and this is the reason why black folks gone survive first in the scary movie 😂
At the very end in the loading screen it shows a siries of numbers that is the code to the one door I think
who else came to cory after finishing fuzions videos
Unc you gotta find some new memes you the same 10 in rotation 🥀
38:42 blud been inna chair too long bck of his head more flattened den Flat Stanley
28:50  Unc reminiscing about olden times 🤦‍♂️

WHAT IS CORY VIBING TOO 38:50 BRO CORY PLEASE LIKE THIS😂😂😂
nice gooning skills
It was that scary😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's been a long time since I heard dlive. his little big planet series was always amazing to watch as well as his slendy tubby vids. most iconic moment for me from dlive will forever be that one video he had with the john cena theme 🥀
It’s cool to see the original (in lore) versions of a lot of the newer fnaf stuff, like how Roxy seemed to be a cowgirl based on the hat (I wonder if her thing went from horse racing to car racing), how Monty was originally a hillbilly banjo guy before he was a rockstar, how Helpy was ‘Mr Helper’ and how the Staffbots used to look like this 35:41   It’s just neat and they did a good job of making each thing’s progression make sense
hi cory
Since I'm bored I'm rewatching all three parts whose with me 😛😛 [I watched all the parts he posted the second he posted em real one know]
23:21 “look at yo dumb ah-😭💔
U don’t like sonic? 😢
Respectfully Corey take ur shirt off
36:32 why is he lookin at us like we did it😭
“Yall remember when I played that” half your viewers I don’t think were alive 😂
Yo, the switch in speed and tone when the jack in the box came. Bro, cut off the whole sentence to turn it on and get out of there. And it didn't help his case on being good at the puzzle 35:49 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nest videos
Can you play tag with Ryan
Help my name is Jackie 😭
10:54 this part has me crying omg
The card was singing thing is right off of Poppy playtime no cap

Hope cory is in the next fnaf movie
I'll buy a Switch 2 eventually, I'm just waiting for my personal system seller which is the new Legends game for Pokémon. Until then, I'll just continue saving money
“you into that?” js itches a scratch in my brain
IM EATING APPLEBEES? (19:54)

28:49  man, love entoan and Dlive. Actually checked on Dlive’s channel a while ago, he’s not doing well, last I checked he had just posted about how one of his cats needed to go to a vet and because of the cost he didn’t know how he’d pay the bills that month, but his cats came before him. Honorable man, sucks to see him not doing well.

This game takes place in the 70s. Getting paid $25 back then would be the equivalent of getting paid $207 in today's economy. Not sure if getting chased by a murderous robot is worth $207 though. 😂

Very well done, appreciate this video!
Thanks for sharing this, learned a lot.
im so dissapointed in this game, this is just some  "Five Nights at Poppy Playtime Hello Bendy" headass generic mascot horror. Its lacking that horrifying ambience and darkness of the previous fnaf games. Yet another walking simulator with scripted chase scenes. Reskin of Security Breach. Im also really dissapointed in the visuals department aswell. There's so many fan games with little to no budget that show better graphical fidelity than this. This is not FNAF.
Great job, this video was very useful!

“For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son so that anyone who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” John 3:16. Jesus died and resurrected so YOUR sins could be forgiven. He loves you so much He suffered and gave His life for you so you may believe in Him and have eternal life. Change your heart and turn to Jesus. “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’” John 14:6. Jesus is the answer to all things and the only way to have true peace and eternal life after this world.

I believe a "Midway" refers to those smaller entertainment parks that generally have games, miniature golf, probably a small to medium water park, climbing walls, what have you. "Back in my day" it was mainly miniature golf, maybe some games, and I believe 1 that I went to had a maze with tall walls and stamp areas to stamp your "passport" type thing.
I didn't even know they were actually making a whole new game, I kinda assumed it was just a fangame  also, Razz has been talking about this since before it even came out. He rides any hype train he can find, and milks it until theres literally nothing left, even before they come out. I almost ignored this video, because i was literally tired of even hearing about secret of the mimic. But hey, you taking longer to upload your playthrough just means you probably care more to release a decent video than just speeding through it and posting it immediately for the content.

THE MIMIIIICCC
10:53 let me find out Cory understands musical leading tones and where notes want to resolve
This game is really cool probably one of its kind in the fnaf series because usually you stay in the same room , watch the cameras and get jumpscared , and with every new game they change it slightly like the animatronics to the gameplay (like in sister location where you could leave the room and do tasks) but this is kind of giving Poppy playtime x FNAF: Security Breach

You can definitely feel a Poppy playtime vibe to it, but I don’t think it’s a bad thing. Every game out there, is influence by another, Poppy was influenced by Fnaf and it feels like this is almost a homage back to Poppy. Also a lot of lore to this :) really enjoyed watching this video

29:05 I remember them from when they playtested an actual FNAF multiplayer mod with their group (an actual mod to Five Nights at Freddy's itself, 2015 was built different). They were so griefstricken over loss of their pet chicken that the video announcing it is still the last thing on their channel  I do not remember their channel name unfortunately.

Completely unrelated, but I wanted to share the gospel the gospel is that really we’re sinners and even just one sin is let alone enough for us not to be able to go into heaven, but Jesus Christ God‘s son died on the cross to make a way for our sins to be forgiven so that we can go to heaven type amen and spread the gospel

(Game Homage): chase scene is very familiar to Mommy Long Legs chase scene in Chapter 2  20. (Game Homage): 38:18 uses crawling through tight spaces mechanic from Indigo Park  21. (Game Homage): 39:37 closing door on Jackie resembles the closing door death of Miss Delight from Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3  22. (Game Homage): 40:16 scene resembles Poppy Playtime: Chapter 2 train crash, could also be a reference to when Player (Henry) falls through the floor in Bendy and The Ink Machine.  (Bonus: Access Upgrade resembles Indigo Park Critter Cuff mechanic where you can access different areas)
10:54 All jokes aside, that was an impressive high note

This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
This game is similar to fnaf 4 in how you need to use sound to know how close the animatronics are, because unlike games like security breach, there are a lot of narrow corridors and very few places to hide and all the enemies are very fast, so if you’re spotted, you’re pretty much dead

Oh my god FINALLY somebody doing a Let's Play that's not constantly interrupting the game with over the top "reactions". Like I genuinely enjoy watching someone play and react to games. I find it way more engaging than watching a dry play through, but I'd rather a dry play through over someone talking about nothing in an exaggerated voice every two seconds because they don't trust my attention span. You are actually just playing the game and talking WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY. I don't know why that is so rare, but THANK YOU for your authenticity!

2 things I want to say: I love the content. Secondly, cory was talking about a youtuber who had a pet chicken that died, and he was in the era of fnaf youtube.

FUSIONZGAMER IS ALREADY AT PART 7
idk why no one else commented this but it's more like a $200 paycheck, because of the time that this takes place. a little more, a little less, give or take, but this game doesn't take place in modern times so $25 isn't just $25.
23:47 Man I love RE7. Cory you haven't played the DLC if I remember correctly..

Somebody tell cory that minimum wage in 1979 (when this game takes place) is around $2,90, 25 dollars for 6 hours was a pretty good deal back then. 2,90 × 6 = 17,40, they get paid $4,16 which is almost 2× minimum wage, this is not accounting the location of mcm, if it takes place in wyoming like other places from the games then the minimum wage was $1,60, which is not a lot... 6×1,60=9,60
35:52 I love the change in the moment where he's funny and everything then horror
Why this game feel like Poppy playtime like dam fnaf changed.....

WHERE IS SCHEDULE 1 PART 2
coryy you would look good in a mullet
I have a theory on this game to be honest. You know how this endoskeleton is stated to adapt to it's characters persona and act like it? It's very possible the reason sun and moon are so different and change so drastically is because this endo skeleton was actually the one INSIDE of it. And because of the fact it CHANGED from sun to moon, it adapts on the fly and changes personality based on which one it is.
Yess Cory playing Secret of the Mimic

Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
I hope he goes back to the old FNAF games he hasn’t played yet either. Like the Ruin DLC, the VR games, etc.
The YouTuber that had a pet chicken was called xxProClassGamerxx
Cory if you see this I think he gets his 2 week pay check and the strawberry artichoke dip with his latte
when the animatronics stopped working cs he started singing😭😭😭
"look at yo dumb a-" 😂😂
The part where u spun the wheel on the jack in the box- u got me lookin behind me to 😭
Yooo am from Fiji lol
cory on his deriod
idk if its just me but why does he sound like coolkid in forsaken 35:57
according to google the game is set in 1979, so that means that he would be risking his live for around $110.70 today as apposed to $25. i'd say it still isn't worth it idk

0:48 actually, kenteshi only remixed the song. It's actually a slowed version of young girl a by siinamota, who wrote the song about his own feelings before he later ended himself. The remix then later blew up, with most people not realizing it wasn't the original 😔
The YouTuber that had a pet chicken is mess yourself  that's the name of the YouTuber
Just came back from falls creek I’m glad you posted ❤
My dear hair twin!
My name is Edwin, I made the mimic. It was difficult to put the pieces together (the instant dislike for the gator at 10:05 😭🙏)
10:53  : the amount of times I watched that part should be a crime😂
damn this literaly evaporated the stress of regional exams off me ty for the video
Didn't scott say he's not gonna make games anymore because he got threats?
CORY U NEED TO PLAY FNAF RUIN

Hey Corey, Kenshin love the past uploads and I love your channel. You're always so funny when you're playing a game also the song you play whenever you end. The video has me dancing in here like an actual nerd. Anyways, enough of me yapping. I'm really hoping to see the next vid of this or daycare

Pure talent. No words

12:52 cory got that muscle memory 😂
They’re mad about a name and he’s wrong because in the Bible The Lord has a discussion with angels about “ a lying spirit” and the Lord sent a troubling spirit upon Saul. You gotta wake up this is not a game. It’s examples in the Bible. But you have to be willing to listen not argue. She couldn’t answer nothing because she was giving you a fullness of what you wanted to know. But you didn’t let her speak and it’s a shame.
2:50 unc trynna be healthy
Did Cory not notice that the data diver kinda looks like a fazwrench
this man hasn’t streamed on twitch in 10 yrs😭
WHAT THE FREAK IS WRONG WITH THIS CLOWN?

I was hoping mark would make a video by now but I guess I need to settle for cory.
28:21 yo I watch him too
$25 in 1979 (when the game is set) is surprisingly about $110 today, still not enough for me to risk my life but more than I was expecting
17:54 But Cory... they basically already did that in Ultimate Custom Night with the Trash gang

Hello everyone, Jesus Christ is Lord, and He loves us all deeply. He desires to have a genuine relationship with us, where we truly know Him as our Lord & Savior. Please turn to Him, away from your sins, and listen to His Word (The Bible). As it is written, “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” -John 3:16 NIV✝️🤍🙏🏽
My fav parts: 10:50 singung broke the door 30:33 call back to security breach 34:33 I love how he puts his whole body into it, then when he gets jumpscared the tuff of hair in the front jumps into the air 35:48 clowns himself for the puzzle sees jackie come in then IMMEDIATELY pulls on the ripcord even faster and just becayse of his face and reaction 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

34:14 I don’t know if Cory noticed but that’s the music box sound from fnaf two
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
The Jack-In-The-box at 34:09 reminded me of the Puppet's music box sound. And Jackie reminds me of Funtime Freddy.
"- I HATE YOU🤬!  - Amazing!" i alr know it will gonna be fire
28/100
Can’t wait for a part 2 I’m liking the game style for this one. Also I’m so excited and eager to read volume 2 mwm I’m waiting till I have it in my hands to read any of the chapters!
Yes fnaf
10:03 Cory: "I don't like that one" The fact that immediately Cory look at that Gator and don't like it crack me up 😂 We all know why
Just came back from Christian camp recently and Looking back at it Cory reminded me of the preacher there. They both changed my life. I’ve got out of anxiety and depression and every time I Wach them speak it’s like a wave of sadness lifted off me. Thank you Cory in general for making everything better!

Cory, i don't know if you'll see this comment. That Roxy Hat you picked up is a collectible item, once you head back to security room/safe room you simply place the collectible in inventory box & pull the lever and it'll automatically get added in your inventory white you would now have your first collectible in-game.

Corey, you may not ever see this. But your video about your teeth work really helped me thru some years, where i was missing my whole bottom row of teeth from an accident. I loved you since the beginning, and it made me realize that people can love me just for my personality and not for how perfect I am. I just want to say thank you. For always being yourself, and praise Jesus, the Lord for everything. I love you and our community.
Cory if you wanted to 100% this game by getting collectibles you missed the Roxy hat back at the start which you dropped, I think you’ll get ATLEAST 80-70% if the game does fully come out

12:02 day 2 of asking Cory can you play a scary clown game
Dispatch VA is Andy Field??
Idk mascot horror seems to be going into this direction of uh… this? Security breach was cool but I don’t really like the walking through hallways with little choice to do what you want…? Idk this also doesn’t feel like anything new thanks to poppy playtime. I didn’t like that one very much, so maybe I’m just biased
28:55 Man, Cory triggered a core memory here. I used to watch Dlive before Cory when I was younger and to hear Cory mention an another YouTuber I loved as a child, it’s honestly so nostalgic and refreshing.
The fact that i imediatly knew fazbear entertainment stole from edwin js bc of mr helpful and the alligator
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you

Supposedly this takes place in the late 1970's! Specifically around 1978, and $25 in todays money has about the same buying power as $130, so for a single shift that isn't too bad of a payout.

Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
The thing that didn't make sense and I'd be glad if someone could explain, if Jackie is strong enough to pull themself forward why doesn't it just grab the protagonist? Like we see their hands reach way past him and onto the walls, why not just pull him in and bite him?
Finally, Cory is actually here for fnaf

i feel like a sleeper agent when ever i hear any audio that came from metal gear series  0:39
Iam new
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
Coryyyyy🎉🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉
39:30 yeah.... "Expert"
My tooth came out guys for the ones who care
SSS maybeeeee
MY HERO ACADEMIA REFERENCE!?!?!?
I actually LOVE his hair like this a lot
17:53 He basically just described Number One Crate and the rest of Trash and the gang from FNAF 6 😭
12:06 I can see the edit making a return again 😭
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
28:50 CORY MENTIONS MY OLD ALLTIME FAV YOUTUBERS?!?!
Buddy said "daily" we waiting for part 2 gng
Fusion is the fnaf guy that plays through the whole game in one night
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
That fact he mentioned FusionZGamer 😮 That is another fav youtuber of mine
Cory u probably won’t see this  But  In case u didn’t know  This game is focused on a character called the Mimic (hence the name of the game) as they explain it’s an endoskeleton that can mimic a character’s appearance and or voice   The Mimic first appears in FNAF security breach ruin dlc at the very end, I won’t spoil the ending tho
Cory always help me relax🤘🏼🤘🏼
omg
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
wsggggggggg 🥋
23:06 The way he said "Yah I'm black" 😂😂
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
THIS is what a tripple A fnaf game should look like in early access.  Remember pizzaplex being early access for youtubers and it was just horrible all around and on release it was somehow even worse? Yeah, thank God they took their time on this, cool concept for a game, looks good as heck and it works.
and hes already failed to do the daily uploads
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Honestly i can't wait for the second part. I tried to watch other YouTubers that posted this game but they don't have the same charm as Cory's so it's was unbearable for me to try and watch. Think I'll just rewatch this one again 😭
It’s been 6 years since Corey had a video under 1 million videos this is the best YouTuber of all time
Algorithm finally did something right
I ve had this on repeat all day
I was actually shocked when you mentioned dlive i remember i used to watch his flash games videos and another YouTuber called tctn tony good days.
I think this game is meant to predate all the fnaf games, well most of them there are a bunch of characters here that might've been scrapped and changed into different characters that the Fazbear company had in other games like that HELPER character which the Fazbear company decided to keep and change the name to Helpy this character is in most of the games which as far back as i can remember is fnaf 6 I believe, there are also some main characters here like that Gator animatronic its most likely Monty but older versioned we can also see the same for Roxy all the characters that were replaced in Fnaf: Security Breach is shown here and imagine the Fazbear company that found the suits and old animatronics most likely took those ideas and used them for the animatronics in Security Breach, this can also be supported by the other game that was released after which Cory didn't play yet which contained the mimic and some suits I believe but that's just what i think is going on here 😅
cory you lied .
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
2:20 i got panda express and a tall glass of water
Yo Cory your the best YouTube
22:31 this man really don’t play about that fear😭😭

This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
Jesus Christ is coming back for his herd, you don’t want to be on the side he leaves and takes the other to heaven. Please don’t waste your time on the worldly things. Jesus Christ loves you so much that He gave His life on the cross for you. Turn away from your sin and turn to Him, because He loves you so much. And there is a chance that you don’t know the thing you do normally is a sin that you’re committing against God. That’s what the devil does, he makes your sin feel normal, but that’s why I feel the need to type this, to let people know that there is a warfare going on with sin and you probably think your fine, but that’s THE BIGGEST LIE from the Pit of hell, but you can be free from that sin and it’s through GODS BEAUTIFUL and PERFECT son Jesus Christ. And If you want to get to know Him, I would go to the Bible, pick a version that is easy to read like the New Living Translation (NLT) or if you want the king James feel (which is the same thing but different style) but still want it to be easy to understand, the New King James Version (NKJV) and start with the New Testament and read Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John to get to know Christ all MIGHTY. He loves you, never forget that. He won’t play hide and go seek with you. If you really want to know Him and I mean truly know him, seek him with an open heart and He will reveal Himself. He loves you and because he loves you He will never leave you and I love you too. And if you think you’re not good enough to go to God…just know, a healthy person doesn’t need a doctor, a sick person does. And we are ALL sick, and we NEED the doctor before we die with that sickness.
Pure talent. No words

Bro when you dropped me and my friends didn’t even expect it Im glad you did drop 🙏
day 4 of commenting until cory notices
I don’t understand why people like the recent fnaf games. The jumpscares are so incredibly low quality that it’s an insult to the franchise. In the original Fnaf series, when you got jumpscared it felt like you were actually there getting attacked, but now, every time you are jumpscared you enter into the black void with the exact same sound affect for every character. They are absolutely abysmal.

I am not big on watching them. But I have seen my fair share of bits and pieces from you. I am more into Indie horror type games. Even though I dont play them, lol. Butttt I do lovvvvve anime, and I order volume 2 of "Monsters We Make", I ordered the online version of volume 1, but I am now trying to get a copy of volume 1's book without paying for both. It would be nice to buy it separately. Other than that, let me dive into this LP.

Who else is here before this blows up
Security breach vibes
(100% no one is going to read all of this)   Don’t know if you know this but Jackie the clown is the same one that burned the festival when Afton was still human and when Fredbear was still there also this game takes place in 1983 the same year of the bite of 83.  Also for all the people that think 1987 was the crying child bite no the bit of 83 was the crying child, another disclosure a lot of people ask me this but the only reason Cassidy (Golden Freddy) was the most brutal and slowest death any of the kids have endured that’s why She doesn’t want to kill Springtrap and make him suffer just the same way she did but lefty wants him dead.. 👍    Edit: The reason why Golden is so mad at Lefty is because lefty really hasn’t endured anything that bad then the main characters and the only reason why springtrap chose Golden Freddy for her intrapment when he had many others to stuff her in is because SP knew that the FredBear costume was very sensitive to moisture so when he sprayed her down with something the spring Locks would crush her living being so now that she’s stuck there.  The reason why she’s so angry at him rather then the others are is because he didn’t kill her and stuff her in he put her in alive (this is what I have learned about Golden Freddy so far so if I mess something up please rephrase me in the comments) and that is why she is so mad at him. 👍  Also the same box that Jackie was in is the same one that he was in at the festival this was in the 1970s and Fazbear entertainment was building props and mascot costumes for carnivals but specifically for the fall fest where Jackie is first introduced so this game takes back all the to the 1970s but this game takes place in the 1983 so the whole point of this FNaF game is going back into the past where it all began where before Freddy and Bonnie they made Costumes that look exactly like the ones here but I don’t know how they got them because Jackie burned down the Fall fest with everyone all the costumes that were on stand so from my guess Jackie is and was the first ever sentient robot but no one knows what soul controls him not yet at least, also when you watch videos about the fall fest you can see when the Fall fest is burning you can see Jackie crawling away. Now mind you this Game series started way back in the 2014 and the game itself takes place in the 19s the only younger year to ever be produced was SB security Breach which was taken place in 2023 so the mimic is closes tied to the Fall Fest Wich Jackie burned down. Hope this helped still learning some of the new lore about SB and this one but this is what I have so far:)👍
Yo cory why was your whole face shaking when you were doing that one puzzle😂😂😂😂😂
This gave me chills… in the best way

CHOP CHOP BOY
Cory play black myth wukong for ur next series
I dislike being a hater towards new horror games because well they are most likely to do well however, this game doesn’t seem like fnaf it just seems exactly like Poppy playtime with the gameplay as the first part is puzzle based then the end is a chase scene maybe it’s because it’s still early access but to me it comes across as unoriginal or inspired but it’s still probably an objectively good game
hey cory if you see this your content always makes me laugh been watching you since forever ago you really never fail to produce good and funny content when people have been strugling your really the best thank you for making my day better
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated

Samurai who sliced the like button 🔥
I ve had this on repeat all day
5:09 "Our motion sensors indicate that someone is still inside the building moving around." someONE...Or someTHING?
Cory you really should stop supporting Steam. I do enjoy the content because they have AMAZING games. HOWEVER they are promoting a r*pe and torture game that includes women and children. It is a sickening game and they find no wrong with posting it since it’s “man’s nature”. Please consider this I beg of you. If anyone supports please like so Cory can see. Also I don’t care if you disagree with my statement r@pe is wrong regardless of anyone’s opinion. Doesn’t matter if it man, woman or children. IT’S SICK and you have people getting off on it.
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
You know Cory ngl I think you the best YouTuber every one has changed but you you don’t care still the same old Cory I think it was a smart idea to leav YouTube and come back mainly because we just didn’t get tired of watching you cuz you were never there and you vids never get old
We’re ready for part 2!
everytime I get on yt and see a Cory vid I almost cry

Cory it would mean a lot to me if you were to post on June 18th my graduation of high school. I started watching you back when you still did cooking video and spooky scary Sunday. Before watching you I didn’t really like watching horror stuff but the way you present it to us makes the video enjoyable and I’m actually able to get a laugh out of it of a horror game. I hope ur well and continue to be. God bless you cory.
Cory, we didn’t get a proper “Up Down Up Down”
Hey cory been a follower for a long time and wondered if you would like to play a game called eyes never wake its a horror game that uses your webcam and microphone so when a monster comes you have to hide in real life i really hope you see this Thanks for all the memories you made ❤❤
Does he not know it’s a prequel
Thats what you said your fear was- 22:35

Cory 25$ dollars in 70s when this takes place I worth over 200$ dollars just wanted to mention that
“My mind is still young”

12:01  Hey Cory, the Roxy hat collectibles and other collectibles are REALLY important to the game. Those Collectibles actually linked up to the Moon.exe game and might find some cool Easter eggs within the mini game itself. If you collect and store all the collectibles into the storage machine, you can progress further through the moon.exe game.   I really do hope you catch this comment before you upload a part 2. :)

Cory pleasseeeee play chill as art bath house remastered
Cleaner vac bro vac stands for vacuum

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LETSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOO
This gave me chills… in the best way
"Yeah I'm black, I'm not gonna sit there and watch you power up" 😭😭
21 of 100 uploads! Keep it up❤
you know hes unc when hes saying “knick knacks and doo dads”💀💀💀💀
I really don't like jackie, he's scary
cory i likw your hair like this
34:33  Didn’t give us time to breathe 😭
Unc done broke the animatronics! 🤣
Can’t wait for the new volume to get delivered 😈😈😈
Og samurai on an alt gotta shoe love❤
28:49 Unc giving us another storytime
Yup
I'm never letting that thing power up either
CORY.  Clocking me in the back of the head at a urinal hardly seems sportsmanlike
Ok from the beginning part I can tell either fazbear entertainment stole some of their animatronic ideas and design from this place or this place tried to steal from fazbear entertainment. Mr Helpful is definitely Helpy
“Cory” and “active” in the same sentence
It's nearly 450k Cory, we want daily upload!! 🙌🏽
In 33:14 u can see the first skin the animatronic was in when Cory had first saw him before he walked into the room with the clown yall peep???
i love the vids please dont leave again
wait did cory always have that white border around his frame i never noticed that
Cory you're u hair is so much better like that pls keep it like that pls 🙏
YAAAAD I get to clean to a Cory video
My name is Edwin, I made the mimic...it was difficult to put the pieces together, but unfortunately, something went so wrong so now I can't do anything but sing this stupid song.
AYE THE HAIR IS COOKING 🔥🔥
W
10:53 😭🙏
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
W
coryxkenshin posting consistently was only in my dreams not to mention the fnaf refrences from  security breach😶‍🌫
not at insult glad you're finally playing a game that i havent watched before, something brand new was really what i wanted to see cory play again much love
7:41 7:47 7:49 7:49 7:50
0:48 did not expect to see All might and Midoriya- but I love it
“I can just SMELL the 25 dollar gift certificate” is wild 😅
Nah 23:18 caught me off guard like what 😭😭😭 balling I'm rolling right now there's no way
Its giving security breach
17:53 hate to break to you buddy XD did you forget about trash and the gang ? From pizza sim ( fnaf 6)
You got more Fiji water than I can fit a house inside a house
2:30 ooohh cory be handsome
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
I woke saw the cory video and it was one of the best days of my life
29:20 His channel name was xxProClassGamerxx  i can never forget my guy!   And ofc Ik Dlive and Entoan!
28:57 ok unc
It’s crazy hearing Cory talk about these old YouTubers because I don’t know them, literally all I was watching was Spanish gameplays. Like literally everyone Cory is talking abt playing FNAF and stuff but in Spanish😭I didn’t really know English at that time but it made me think about those Spanish YouTubers I would watch playing FNAF and scary games like bro that time was literally peak and amazing.
Cory can you react to your videos back from 2009
They gonna put boxy in the next fnaf game 😂
The twist out looks better on him and still gives iconic Afro vibes
Do part 2 please
Man’s working when horses was all the horse power you was getting 25 $ is crazy
"the channel is about to get real active" SAY LESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
This takes place around the late 70s, so a $25 giftcard would be around $300 back then.
28:20 fusionzgamer??
Day one of asking for CookingxKenshin @CoryxKenshin
Jesus is king

35:50 the way he starts speeding up out of worry after he sees her is CRAZY. there's going to be so many edits of him pulling it i can just tell 💀
39:36 LET ME THROUGH-
2:22 2:22 2:22 2:23
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes

Also, I hope you enjoy this game and I hope you and everyone else in this comments section have a great day, week, and weekend, and the same to all your families!!!!! 👍😁👍👍😁👍👍😁👍 P.S.: Secret of the Mimic comes out in less than 7 minutes!!! 😁

I just wanna point out it aint even 25$. Its a 25$ GIFT CERTIFICATE!!! You wont even put that in your bank account you can only spend that on Fazbear co. stuff
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this

This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Cory if you like the mimic you have to play the dlc of security breach
I think Arnold's voice actor is the same voice actor that voices sasaki from sasaki and Miyano his name is Kellen Goff and he voices several other characters in the different fnaf games😭 I'm disintegrating
What had to cooking with kenshin😭
Mr. Kenshin sir we’re gonna need that part 2 to schedule one please and thank you🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️

The puppet box? 34:08
4:51 His name? His name was…..
Cory, you put the collectibles in the inventory machine where you got the crank. Then you can use them in the Moon.exe game
Jackie supports the gorilla tag community😊
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
Who else is here before this blows up
Keep the messy fro
25:54 That little tool is the same as a Faz-Wrench. Aka the one Cassie got in Security Breach: Ruin. She goes “It’s a faz-wrench. Like my dad’s.”And THIS GAME is taking placing in the late 1970s-1980s and Security breach took place in the 2020’s. AND during the mimic chase in security breach, you can see some of the costumes from Murray’s that the mimic put himself in SOOOOOO. Arnold could be Cassie’s dad, and Murray’s could be buried below The Pizzaplex in Security breach since we know that the Pizzaplex was built on top of another establishment?
Cory still needs to play fnaf ruin
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
A A A❤❤❤❤❤
17:55 is that not just number 1 crate
Wow you already got the new fnaf
Cory can you play Spider-Man 2 pleaaaaaasse
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
This game is not like old school FNAF, more like Poppy playtime
Hearing Cory namedrop Dlive and Entoan was a childhood revival.
New editing now ?
Cory I’m so ready for part 2 gng 😭
guys i think his name is the mimic
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
STOPPP WHY HE ASK US “where roxy at? hehe..you into that?” IM ON THE FLOORRR😭
12:11-12:16😅
6:00 He says the motion sensors never tell the truth. You’re telling me the guy knows something’s moving inside the building and is letting him go in. Messed up bro
🔥🔥🔥
Yo Cory I’ve seen you’ve been working out do you have a routine you usually do?
10:05 Cory got flashbacks of Monty 🙏😭🙏
I saw a video of you twerking Cory😭
CORY PLEASE SAY HIIIIIIII IVE BEEN HERE EVER SINCE 2014!!!
Don’t worry Cory I was screaming too
PLEASEEE CORYYY PLAY "LIFE IS STRANGE 2" it's the best series in the channel no capp! I love youuu no rush cory, take yo timee ;)))
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
That guy with the chicken you was talking about. I’m pretty sure his name was proclassgamer or something like that.
Cory I recommend a game for you that I think we will all love if we did the FNAF security breach can you do FNAF RUIN?
23:47 "you know whos in there ... Jack Baker" Cory 2025 SO EMOTIONAL😭😭🥹🥹
I hate when people be like real ones here rn nigga I’ve been here since I was 12
10:50 game did NOT wanna hear him sing💀
I really hope he doesn't overwork himself because ethe manga/webcomic is already a ton of work plus him working on the sales on top of gaming AND being his own editor 😭We take this man for granted sometimes, I'm just happy he's uploading even if its once every 2/3 months
29:08 His name was XxProclassgamerXx
So no up down up down Cory??
Well Cory some context is that the game takes place before all the other chat games around the time Freddy wasn’t made and it’s a reference to the mimic which is something you’ll go up against in security breach ruin dlc and this is like the mimic before the whole timeline so this is token way back in the past before afton and Emily opened Fred ears and made spring Bonnie and fredbear as we now this is the game that takes first in the timeline

#1 on trending, let's go Revelation 22:11-15 KJV [11] He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. [12] And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. [13] I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. [14] Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. [15] For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

bro play Black Myth wukong
LISTEN‼️ • Hi everyone, I just wanted to remind you that there’s life after death and the only way to that life is through Jesus Christ - So I want to encourage you all to get to know JESUS while you’re still here, breathing!! - Seek Him with all your heart and pursue a true relationship with Him. As Scripture says in Jeremiah 29:13, ‘You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.’ This journey is about a deep, unwavering connection with God, not just in times of trouble, but always.  - JESUS already went through hell for us so that we can make Heaven our home - Hell wasn’t made for us humans. It’s was made for satan and all of his angels (demons), so Jesus Christ made a way for us to not go to hell by Him dying on the Cross for our sins - taking our place and us His - So I urge you to repent of your sins and seek God’s forgiveness, as stated in 1 John 1:9: “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” - I love you all and I pray that each and everyone of you get to know Jesus Christ and may have an encounter with Him. Stay blessed family❤️.
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!

“Yeah I’m black I’m not gonna sit there and let you power up…” - Cory 2025

35:53 Scott literally looked at Poppy Playtime and said, “You guys like monsters with long arms? bet."
Hey, we have the same fridge, except I have a window on the right side.
The fact that an ads came out of nowhere 11:06
You just earned a new subscriber
I ve had this on repeat all day
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
better be doing that next video rn buddy😠

Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
if the mimic is called the endo skeleton as seen in SB Ruin and what Dispatch calls it, could this mean the mimic is not jackie? so if we get a full gameplay with a scene with jackie and a moving mascot costume side by side, then i guess it would mean that i was correct.
14 hours and over 2million views is crazy ngl🔥🔥🔥
Cory gotta hop on security breach ruins
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
How come YouTube never puts #1 Trending for gaming on Cory’s videos?

Algorithm finally did something right
Now we just need a FNAF + Kindergarten mashup fangame with Cory as the playable character and this summer will be perfection.
That first 10 seconds of the video ahahhahahahhaha
THE OG IS BACK ✨✨✨✨also Milk like UHT ones isn’t supposed to be refrigerated it just needs to stay at a cool temperature and away from the sun so you could keep it out like in the pantry , this is how we do it in France , also UHT means that the milk is sterilized at higher temperatures so it’s easier to store and take without having to worry about it being out of the refrigerator . But I guess Non UHT milk actually needs to be refrigerated.   Love your videos ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Bro Cory said you dumb a 😂😂😂

22:30 i don't know if it's a reference or not, but when cory is saying what he's going to do to the guy on the other side, for some reason, everything cory said, is actually one of his biggest fears.
I ve had this on repeat all day

Can you play cuphead the DLC
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
Cory, I don't know if you'll ever see this, but I just wanted to ask, did you change the Bible verses at the end of your video from KJV to a modern version? The modern versions of The Bible have changes made to them, and possibly even verses removed. I'm assuming that if you did do this, it would be to make the Bible verses easier to read for your audience, but I would recommend using KJV, because the KJV doesn't have any changes made to it like that of a modern version.
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss

4:53 WE'RE STRAIGHT UP NAME-DROPPING EDWIN RIGHT OFF THE BAT?!?    Scott must be losing his touch, normally you'd have to do a 10 minute 8-bit minigame where you go around a pizzeria collecting different random items that, if you align with the sun, in just the right order, at just the right angle, at just the right time of day,  form the shape of each letter of his name in their shadows, and you have to do it all while springtrap is chasing you.    Oh yeah, and the name wouldn't be in english. It would be in the same wingding language the message in the exotic butter room is written in on the wall in security breach.
U should play into the pit

12:09 NOT AGAIN CORY ROXY ISNT TOY CHICA
I killed you in fortnite bro😭😭😭😭
It's great to see the new Fnaf game "Secret of the mimc" and we have Cory to thank for providing us with amazing and funny gameplay of it. Plus with the introduction of this game it will definitely add more to the lore of the fnaf universe. Nice to hear handy units voice again, never gets old. I notice while watching that the "data dive" tool looks a lot like the faz wrench, which indicates that Arnold might be Cassies father from fnaf "security breach ruin".
Wish we got a Silent Hill 2 remake playthrough 😔 by Cory
Where’s SSS I NEEEEEEDD ITTTTTTT
330k like in 9 hours
That afro thoughhhhh😭🔥🤝
Can we get a ruin playthrough . Ple
Corey, I’m sorry but what happened to your dog Samson

28:50 Unc reminiscing the old days (i love you cory.)
3:05 Woahhhh am I the only one who was waiting for “ARE YOU READY FOR FREDDY!!”😢😢

23:32 🎵 He's a runner, he's a trackstar 🎵
Took a whole week but we here bruh
another day, another video of cory🫰🏾
I'm still waiting for Spider-Man 2
So apparently Fnaf Secret of the Mimic takes place around 1979. It's likely to believe that this game happened before Freddy and the other's animatronic get introduced
Happy Friday the 13th guys
BRO GO PLAY KINDERGARDEN 2
Btw Cory you ain't the only one that knows dlive, I don't know if you seen lordminion.

11:07 at literally 4 years old i had a nightmare like this but it was my toys singing. i was falling asleep in my dream after some performance in my toddler bedroom. i hummed what we were singing and one toy yelled "STFU" (vividly !!! i still hear it) and it was not a flashbang sound it was a gunshot and i woke up. " age 4? youre lying" dude i wish but we moved when i was 5-6 years old while i was in school and it was in the apartment before then. because i remembered it at that time after i had moved. im 31 now. weirdest dream to THIS DAY.
PLEASE
Jesus Christ is Lord,Jesus Christ died willingly and rose 3 days later he defeated death and paid the price for our sins on the cross,Jesus Christ paid a debt that he did not owe,acceot Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and repent ✝️  2 Corinthians 12:9—“My grace is all you need, for my power is the greatest when you are weak.”

🙂
Cory I was on the toilet what could I do😂
The intro for the game is so Outlast-y, not gonna lie)) And I love it
This takes me back too, I miss the playthrough/walkthrough days so much! The better days of YouTube.  Also, this game is reminding me of bioshock and alien isolation in a few different ways and I’m here for it. 🔥
Cory it’s 1 32 am and I stayed to watch u
‘250k likes in less than 10 hours

🇨🇦👮🧑‍🔧🧑‍🚒🧑‍🏫👲🧑‍⚕️
Day 4 of asking cory to play undertale
HI
4:54 "MY NAME IS EDWIN, I MADE THE MIMIC. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER."
Cory I am begging you to play Expedition 33
28:40 I remember i use to watch entoan and dlive play little big planet back when i was in high school. I knew entoan from dlive and dlive from nanners when they collabed in a prop hunt video
28:55 OH I definitely know them both, one of the classic people that contributed into shaping my childhood
Here at 4 am because i missed the video Love you cory
Bro said that the fibers slows down the sugars entry into our blood and I dead looked it up and bro was right.....W CORYY!!!! ⚔⚔
Cory the uploads may be inconsistent but we love every video. Find it funny you say nick nacks and doodads in this fnaf game as you did for the first episode of security breach. Real samurai in me
MY GLORIOUS KING HAS UPLOADED OMG
a bunch of nicknacks and do dads
This doesn’t even feel like a true FNAF game. It's more of a Poppy Playtime clone if you ask me. It’s disappointing to see the series straying so far from the original FNAF theme. It feels like the FNAF name was added to the title just for brand recognition and to make the game more popular
The first thing I saw was this video 😂
Waitin for part 2 bro
Yeeeaaauhhh booooyyy
MORE I NEED MORE UGGGHHHHHHHHH
LITTLE NIGHTMARES 3
11:02 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭YOOOO IM DYINGGG

PLAY HELP WANTED PLEASE 🙏🏽
14:54 secret of mimic taste place in 1979. And according to a us inflation calculator on google, $25 in 1979 would be worth $110 today.  Still wouldn’t rush it though, I’d rather get fired
you may not have uploaded first but you are first on trending
Yo Cory i suggest a game you should play it's called " Kinito Pet" it's a horror game that i think you would like.
I just woke up and watched this
Thanks for posting again corey, you made my day 100× better

Cory play indigo park
Anyone else think this game is a little strange? I think the mascots look more like the dark deception characters, instead of fnaf. This ain’t my fnaf😔
can someone explain what Cory meant by where roxy at, at 12:10
This is my first video of yours, and I’m hyped already!
I’m so glad I got to see Cory play it first instead of seeing snippets on tt or insta I hate that. Cory’s game play 🔛🔝
No problem cory. Glad you're enjoying our teams game! ;)

Im more concerned about when we getting SSS again😭
14:48 Secret of the mimic takes place in 1979, and $25 in 1979 is worth $100 today, and In most fnaf games, you get payed $100 for working the night shift
28:30 yeah youtubers were quite the racist back then  Wait
Jackie's the name of my high school teacher lmao. Awesome video corry. Truly. I hope everything is well and your ready for summer. Ive been watching you for many many summers and you've brought me great happiness and great worry. I see you as a close friend and always hope your doing good mentally and physically.

My name is Edwin
Whenever he said "hey it's boxy" it sounded like Lucas Baker when he started yapping about "the winner is Hoffman or Clancy" I found it was a pretty cool Easter egg I found also W RE7 reference with the "you wanna know who's in there Jack Baker"
“You haven't seen anything strange have ya ?”  “Yeah… there's a dead body.”  “Great 😃”

Hey Cory you should play new chillas art the bathhouse. The new version have a different plot and story
I find it funny that it's 2:10 in the morning when im watching this. Perfect timing got the late night loaded taco doritos mixed with the sweet and spicy doritos. Im big backin.
Is unc ever gonna play security breach dlc???
Who the hell thought it was a good idea to put wally west in a costume😭
CORY IS A MY HERO FAN?!!!!

28:42 no one forgetting 2 little big planet's goats

Bruh what's happening, Cory is talking about getting sent an early access copy at 2 in the morning, and next thing I know he's going on a road trip to get some snacks. I'm in bed rn... 😴
W Coryyyyyyy❤
This game actually looks pretty good
25:25 what was man peaking his head to the side IRL for😂……..much love cory🙌🏾😂
OMG DAILY UPLOADS YAYYYY
I remember watching DLive Play Little Big Planet back in like 2016 or sometime around then, that was nice, I miss those videos 😔💚
Cory typed part one in the thumbnail like he's gonna finish the series or something
ARE YOU READY FOR FREDDY
36:13 what are we playing anymore. It’s not fnaf anymore lol. Entertaining yes. But I almost forgot what this game even was for a second
The year is 1979
I like how Cory thought the MC's incentive to be there was a $25 gift card, and not the cruel and absurd threats from the company.. 😭
oh h*ll  yea, you ain't goanna be swallowing them sweetish fish for a while now Hehe he. 2:44
35:50 this whole scene got me crying dawg 😭
35:52 BRO HE STARTED GOING SO FAST AS SOON AS HE SAW THE HAND💀💀
I love watching your vids
35:53 yalll please pause it here and slow it down. He was so scared of that arm bro 😂😂😂
28:28 Quit yapping Unc! 😂😂😂
We need to keep this intro Cory 🙏🏽😭
Here at 3:06 am
250k likes destroyed. NEXT PART US ASAP CORY THANK YOUUUUUUU! 🙏
❤❤
35:47 bro chose the worst time to tell everyone not to say anything suspicious about it just for him to hit maximum overdrive cranking that thing over. this man is the funniest person ever.
Year is 1979
Heyyy Cory you have gotten muscular and fit!
8 hours ago is crazy!!!
Am I the only one kind of disappointed with this game? Yeah the quality is great but it’s really more poppy playtime than anything. Doesn’t feel like Fnaf at all
I've been here for so frickin long lol .
IM SO HAPPY I HAD TO SLEEP BECAUSE THIS UPLOADED AT 4AM LMAO i wanted to watch this while eating lunch lolol (i always sleep late cuz of insomnia, sometimes never)
2:09 W BasedGod
I'm kinda confused as to why they made Arnold so relatable at the beginning only to have him...not react to pretty much any of the scares during the game itself. I feel like he would at least gasp in surprise...
23:17 WOAH WOAHHHH
W birthday surprise
Turns out, this guy was risking his life for $110.12 in 2025's economy. $100 is such a scam.
Is it just me, or Jackie kind of sounds like Cory
So poppy’s playtime with fnaf as the cover, ok
39:20 Craziest shade on an actual non-generic name 😭
REAL ONES ARE HERE🤭
30:14 the mimic busted down the tables thru the wall changing into the clown fit
Oh this one expert!😂
Best believe I'm checking your channel every week from now on and before.
I love these videos :D
I like this gameplay
10:50 was so funny
16:20 Okay Beyoncé
I lowkey might got to wait till its out and play it first before i watch the video cause this looks fire
Why YT be removing chunks of audio in gameplay?
Cory with his hair down 😍😍
38:36
Still no fnaf ruin😢
Dude can’t wait for part 2 this new fnaf game looks amazing already
What happened to Cory's eye in 9:04😭😭
Dang I'm  8 hours late😢😢
When he said go to bed it's 3 am it was actually 3:am for me xd
What happened to your braids
Cory in his afro. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤love it all that hair 😍😍😍
Can you do more Minecraft
int this just poppy playtime now lmao
Plsssss play dark deceecion chapter 5
You should play Dead rising deluxe remake. It's up all right now and it's for sale for Xbox
Hey Cory hope you see this
Your a Great person Keep it here you go
35:49 But he is though.
Day 6 of asking Cory to play Friday Night Funkin' new update...

28:42  is his channel still up and what’s his YouTube name again
Cory the YouTuber your referring is xxproclassgamerxx
Jesus saves✝️
Since when
stop aura farming
I would not do none if that for no 25$ gift certificate 😂
All i want to say is that they kind of copy poppy playtime. That chase with the Jackie ressembles the chase with huggy wuggy. Also the thing of "pressing buttons" so that the "carts" talks a bit is also from poppy playtime
I have been waiting
SSS when??
12:20 HAD to pause it right here 🙏🏾💀
My b day lucky
the jumpscare in the start keeps getting me dude 😂
25:03 “😁I got it I got it” next then you know “NOOOOO😱”
Kindergarden 2 part 2 when??
32:13 I had comment everyone stopped talking
SSS when??
25:10 NOOÆÆ
idk if its just me but this fnaf game is giving poppy play time by the way we have to play(like the players hands). I really hope this game does not disappoint. super funny play thru!
Hey cory back in 2019 i won a Xbox but didn't know how to text you back if you could send me a number and I will text you

35:40 Yo that's the bus driver from Bo2 Zombies 🤣
Use me as love Cory button❤❤
Yep😊
I only have one question...ARE YOU READY FOR FREDDY?
Cory, what happened to your hair? You used to have braids about a month ago.
"Guys, I don't wanna hear no jokes, (oh he's really good at that puzzle.)"...... "WHAT THE FREAK?" - Cory
Yo Cory uploaded 🙏 ❤
Another banger like always cory.

You look like my brother Jamell
PLEASE CORY I NEED TO SEE YOU WITH A FRO I WOULD MELT
2:45 bros fridge is stacked with Fiji water
I started crashing out the second I saw the numbers for the code and Cory didn’t😭
The amount of jumpscares in this game that almost killed me is CRAAAZZY
0:16 He got his afro back! But it's bigger than ever 😅 (or maybe that's not an afro, I don't know)
Wow he’s really good in that puzzle!!!🤩35:53
You should play repo with friends on your own time brotha
Cory can we pls have SPOOKY SCARY SUNDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
when CoryxKenshin upload a new video 23:32
Anyone else notice how this is waaaaayyyyy to similar to poppy playtime
It's gonna be just like old times again
17:55 no one tell him about the trash gang
12:09 ifykyk
Cory with his hair out really reminds me of the 2014 type era
39:20 “You have a regular person’s name!” Like “Freddy” isn’t 😭😂
DLIVE THE GOAT
1:26 he should put that there every time he plays a fnaf game and then say …ARE YOU READY FOR FREDDY 🤣🤣🤣
Yo cory if we talken about Roxy, you missed out on Fnaf Security Breach Ruin, just another fnaf game u missed while u were away
jackies jumpscare is so disapointing
11:48 The mimic is hiding in the elephant costume with bday hat on. (U can see the back of endo skeleton poking out) and 12:10 it's not there anymore
Wow
He hit tha couldn’t go ve y’all too much
THE AFRO'S BACK
The pfp finally accurate  again
You know he’s past the point of exhaustion when he can’t drive straight🤣
I know this doesn't relate to the video, but you are my #1 comfort YouTuber. You've really helped me in life, with those comfort videos and little quotes in middle of games. You're really funny and kind, and whenever I watch you it seems like a distraction with all thats happening right now.  I would like a pin, but thats optional. Keep up the good work, Cory. You make more than me comforted and happy.
CORY HOW DO I GET AN AFRO LIKE URS!!!! 😭 PLS HELP A BROTHA
At 35:30 why does the robot look like the bus driver from bo2 zombies the map tranzit
17:51 The new member of Trash and the Gang 💀💀💀

Going through a breakup right now and this video helped me so much you have no idea

39:34 reminds of the janitor

28:49  OH! I REMEMBER HOW I WATCHED THOSE DLIVE GMOD VIDEOS BACK IN THE DAY!!

Hey Cory, just wanna say that your videos honestly take me to a different world.. I’m currently active duty overseas in the Middle East.. with the stuff that went down a couple of hours ago.. it’s nice to know that I can escape this reality for maybe just a couple of minutes
9:28 Mimic watching Cory from high up in the dark 💀
28:56 How dare you assume I do not know EntoanThePack and Dlive22891 😂, those two were my first youtubers I subscribe to since I graduated in 2012 and were the first who got me into horror games they were the OG's to me. And their pretty much still doing Youtube/Twitch just they both have second channels now so they pretty much still around.
I remember the troll one. SECRET OF FUCKING MIMIC BETCH

“Guys, I don’t want to hear no .. Oh , he’s really good at that puzzle 😊 WHAT THE FREAK 😮” Starts pumping the machine with all his might 😭😭😭
Made me think about outlast getting in 8:37. 😂😂😂(edit) says what I'm thinking. Yes Corry, I remember 😂.
lets not forget he was in the fnaf movie
So im summarization of this situation   To level with you that robotic skeleton has glitched out and is homicidal and can take the mannerisms and persona of whoever its mimicing ( i would assume also this is mimicing some level of skill if so is terrifying you now have the skill of a serial killer combined with adaptable AI fucking yikes but even if it doesn't still a fucked situation) And can fit inside and wear any costume and could be in any costume you come across btw also the building is filled with costumes.  Yeah just go ahead and dock my pay and take the truck☠️
“Yeah I’m black”😭

I asked chatgpt what Cory's latest post is and it took me here
Oh my gosh, I’m so happy you made a new video. Me and my mom and my brother are big fans.😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤
Cory- my favorite youtuber coming in clutch with an awesome video for a bad day. You always make my days brighter ❤  Have a good one, and looking forward to the next one 😁
Doesn’t this fnaf game feel like resident evil village like how the the 5&6 were really buggy and then the 7th had a new unknown protagonist and was a step in the right direction for the franchise or is it just me?
the executive symbol looks like the monarch symbol from the monsterverse movies
2:54 cory the only horror gaming youtuber i be actually learning stuff from 😭 and 3fs sometimes
LOL crazy that I’m also watching this at 2am 0:31
Doesnt matter how many breaks cory takes he still looks tired as hell
29:07 Cory you’re referring to ProClassGamer a dude who became incredibly popular in the early days of the FNAF community but it’s interesting for me because I really got into FNAF at the release of Sister Location so by then he had stopped uploading videos and went silent online in fact the only reason I knew about him was because Fusion and Dawko would always reference him in their videos plus I’ve seen videos of people reminiscing about him honestly seemed like a cool guy and it sucks what happened to his chicken hopefully he’s doing way better nowadays
2:45 whaat the fiji
This game definitely looks like it’s gonna have a vr adaptation, can’t wait.

Hi Cory just know how proud I am of you and all the doors that have been open to you… as a subscriber and an editor for fun!

I’m grateful to have come across you when my husband showed me your channel keep it up! God bless you Cory! “ Be strong and let your heart take courage, all you who hope in the LORD” Psalm 31:24 love you from the Santana’s!

Hey Cory you should play one socket, it's a cool horror game where you have to defend yourself against a creature that was created by a nuclear explosion, you have ONE SOCKET to plug in five or six plugs. one is for a speaker, the other is called a close lamp, another is the far lamp a guy will call you every now and then and give you a number to a three digit code. don't wanna spoil anything else for the master samurai,also a big thanks to Cory for making such amazing content and making his vids so entertaining for the samurai and everyone that's reading this sub to CORYXKENSHIN. Thank you and Cory for reading keep up the good work cory✅
My good man, I appreciate so much having you back! You're my companion in my cleaning and studying time. Thank you so much for your hard work!

We samurais will always stand for you and pray for your success and good health.

what I love about Cory's vids its not the games he plays or the jokes he makes (even though we know the brotha' funny) its the fact that every video doesn't feel like he's just playing a game for us it feels like a conversation between two people like he's talking to each one of us individually this is why Cory is my favorite youtuber and I'm proud to be a samurai for this community 🙏    Proverbs 10:12: Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers over all wrongs    been watching sense happy wheels era and been tuned in ever sense watched every sss every fnaf eveery happy wheels vid btw   what he throw lo cee blow?   thanks for being coryxkenshin fam :)

34:33
The game takes place in 1979, which sorta explains doing this all for $25. It's still, like, not a whole lot, but then again, Fazbear Entertainment has always been about giving such low quantities of money [$120 per week in 1992 for FNAF 1, $100.50 per week in 1987 for FNAF 2]. It appears we're always playing as characters who aren't doing very well financially in this series. I mean, Mike and Jeremy literally circle job applications on their newspapers as if to say "HOLY COW I HAVE A CHANCE!!" in the first two games, and Arnold is doing bad enough to be working with Fazbear Entertainment, so it makes a lot of sense. Also, Arnold didn't know about the Mimic. For all he knew, he just assumed it was going to be a simple "get in, grab it, get out" situation.
250k bro we passed that in 5 hours 😭😭😭❤❤
He trying so hard to crash 😂
Love the fro bro 👍👌
Cory I had to wake up in the middle of my slumber for this big dog

"time to open the DoOR- " 10:52
Hi cory chivalry williams
Nah I mean you're afro looks cool
I just started watching Cory’s walking dead playthrough, and his hair has basically come full circle, it’s amazing
off topic but would love to see some white knuckle gameplay, i think you might be up for the challenge and horror of that game, and its quite addicting. hek you if you enjoy it too much you might try to beat all the modes.
well, 25 dollars is 25 dollars
OH GREAT HEAVENS!!!  00:36
i’ve been summoned.
We're is momo
Yesir real one ☝️

Perfect vid for my road trip 😃

CORY WE NEED A NEW SPOOKY SCARY SUNDAY😭
29:25 unc reminiscing 'bout the ol' days
30:06 "I guess I just get irritable, in the late nights." IN THE LATE NIGHTS!?  Brother has been instigating and being irritable to every character in fiction, throughout all these vids when he came back. Having it ruled down to it being just at night is the understatement of the year bro-
It’s crazy how every horror game he plays instead of it being scary it’s a damn comedy
270k in 5hours. I expect pt. 2 by noon tomorrow.
15:58 ddlc ptsd kicking in rn
cory we beed fridge reveal
HELL YEAAA PART 2
Jesus loves you, he genuinely does. Though people have twisted this love negatively. I can assure you that he loves you, and wants you to turn to him and have a relationship with him. God bless you have a great day.
Cory dont forget that 25 bucks in 1970 was around 110 buckos

Cory hair LOOOOOOOONG
Hot take:  the protagonist is Cassie's dad.  Because of the tool.
I’ve always loved a fine man with his natural hair out. CORYYY THE TWIST OUT IS GIVINGGGG 🤩
It’s time to open the-DOOR!!!* animatronic shut down* that got me
im kind of disappointed that the games are getting further and further away from the original story line. i miss the simplicity of watching the animatronics behind cameras especially in "sister location" where you could also physically move around.
the CODES ON TBE CUBE
10:02 well you know he dead
39:45 Cory what is that face😂
I miss the Afro!!!❤

Cory tryna be his worst nightmare to somebody else (If you don't know what I'm talking about) Cory: "My worst fear is I'm using the bathroom at a urinal and someone hits me on the back of my head and my face falls in the urinal." (I'm so sorry I forget what video he said it in, it was a long time ago.
“Look at ya dumb a-“
Needed this after a long day of sad news
Kindergarten 2!?!????? NOWWW
"A bunch of nick nacks and do das"

Like if you watch cory when you about to smoke or after ❤
ENTOAN AND DLIVE MENTIONED??? Those were the first gamer YouTubers I watched!!!
Im aussie, and according to the Reserve Bank of Australia, $25 in 1968 would be worth ~$378.89 in 2024...
2:37 He says this as i'm in bed under the blankets 😭 Barely even BLINKED wit efficiency and he saying some "feel ya energy" 💀 I love ya, Cory. Stay strong brother and God bless! 💪🙏
250k likes? dawg you got that in 4 hours god damn should have asked for atleast 500k 😂
Silent Hill 2 remake?

I realize that Jackie’s music box music is the exact same one as the marionettes one in fnaf 2 but more disorded
Question and not to be rude. Cuz I really liked the cuphead series and I wonder. When are you gonna play the cuphead DLC
The chosen one has posted 😮❤❤❤

YOU KNOW ITS A GOOD DAY WHEN CORY UPLOADS FNAF CONTENT!!!!
I know am going to sound stupid but does the chase king of remind you of the dogday chase
not to trauma dump but i know my ex would be as excited as I am rn that you posted, thank you for being that <//3
35:52 the panic pulling that crank was hilarious 😂😂
Cory, I recommend you play Miside.
I thought Arnold sounded familiar and realized that he was voiced by Kellen Goff after scrounging the internet to try and find the anime I’ve heard his voice in 😭 (It was Saiki K and Sasaki to Miyano)
Theory: we see our character pick up what looks like “Freddy Faze Wrench” without all the colors n stuff. In ruin, Cassidy picks one up and it’s mentioned her dad had one just like it (assuming he’s a mechanic). What if this is Cassidy’s father and this takes place before ruin. Idk, maybe this is common knowledge and I’m really behind but I put it together real quick and went “😱 I NEED TO TELL THE PEOPLE”
THE BEST GAMER YOUTBER
He is good at doing the pulling thing 🫡🫡
23:22 😂😂😂😂
Sorry samurais for being late!✌️
i love cory’s fluffy hair lol

The guy who are talking about with the chicken who died is the legendary PROCLASSGAMER, he recently posted 2 months ago..Glad you remember him..I miss those good ol FNAF days too, can't believe I've been watching you for 10 years.
Mice in security breach ruins and they mentioned Cassie’s dad in ruins and since u meet the mimic in the deep at the last part of the game you might be playing as Cassie’s dad
12:15  “you into that?”     -Coryxfreaky
"Ima put a smiley face on a box and call it boxy." So who finna tell him about the paper plate cutouts and the actual box from UCN-
3:00 unc doing to much

2:49 BrOTher YOU GOTTA GET AWAY FROM THE SATAN WATER I'm being SO real; Wonderful Food company owns Fiji water, and legit heLD WATER DURING A WATER EMERGENCY IN oh i don't know a LITTLE KNOWN PART OF THE WORLD CALLED CALIFORNIA  thankfully, california being located on the coast means they have plenty of access to water, so I'm sure an immensely greedy corporation selling pistachios, almonds, pom juice and water holding onto a little bit of it will have 0 repercussions for the state going forward  🔥
4 hours ago
“Don’t let me catch you at the urinal” old ones remember when cory said his worst fear was being clocked at a urinal 😭😭😭

“It was you wasn’t it? Ya dang gator” Cory getting flashbacks to Monty 😂
The 401th time asking cory to revisit bendy and the dark revival. Can't stop won't stop. Atleast maybe you can play it after you've done the fnaf marathon, but I feel like the bendy franchise needs some love too, since you never finished either of the games.
CORYYYYY

35:47 I mean u are abnormally good at that puzzle I've never seen anyone do it that fast and I've watched dawko razzbowski 8 bitryan and  fusion z gamer😂
Ik it's a long info, but pls read this Please come to the Lord y'all, the end times are really near, be saved, repent from your sins follow Christ and accept him as your Lord and Savior. Because he loved us, he died for us for our sins. Have faith in him and his resurrection.  John 14:6 (NKJV) Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.  Matthew 11:28 Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  Romans 6:23  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Ephesians 4:22-24 that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, 23 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 24 and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness.    accept the holy Spirit If you're worried Abt your past self, be baptized because that's how you are reborn or by accepting the Holy Spirit. Faith matters, later👋
Cory please shout me out I want to be just like you one day

this reminds me of poppy play time alot
250k in one day yall this man came back for a reason
This version of fnaf is reminding me a lot like Poppy Playtime. I expected at least some version of a camera gameplay to at least maintain some of the original fnaf idea
35:49 was the funniest part
Remember when five night at Freddy’s was about sending five nights at Freddy’s
Yah normally I'm into that but Im not gonna lie Roxy is mid maybe a 4 at most not really all that good looking.
UNC POSTED!!❤

U mad funny bro in every video me and my mom always Be laughing In every video 😂
Cory you make great content can you bring back SSS
Yoooooo, Entoan, Dlive, and Wade went crazy on them Little Big Planet Vids!!!!
Boxy got me 😂😂
Repent for Jesus for he is returning soon. You might think he’s not but he is, look at this world and how it inlines with the Book of Revelations. Every thing you see in it is identical to what’s going on. I didn’t write this to strike fear but to save out you from desolation. Yes it will convict but that’s the purpose, it so you will change your ways because it does not please God, the One who create you out of His likeness and image (Genesis 1:26-31) He wants you to repent because of your sin. Its what separates you from Him, sin leads to death. He wants a relationship with you, He wants to protect you, He wants to heal you and help you grow in life. He has no intentions of harming you or wanting you to live in calamity. But you push him back everyday with your bad decisions or choices. You have to stop living for this world, not the earth but the world. Where fornication lays dormant, pride, greed, hatred, lust, jealousy, envy, mistrust, gluttony, idolatry, all types of evil. It’s everywhere, where you walk, it’s on your phone, it’s at your house, it’s surrounds you and your friends, it’s at your job. You live in it and it controls you. Your apart of that world and its why you sin. It’s a slaughterhouse and you and everyone else are sheep. Everyday you get closer and closer to that blade. You all are being manipulated and deceived. There’s no truth in this world but outside of it. In this world there’s no life but outside. To get outside this world is through Christ, the Son of God. The one who God sent down to die for all of us because of the evil things we have done. We all have done evil, no one on this earth is blameless. But the one who shred blood for us on the Cross. Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the Son of The Most High. He loved us so much that He died for our sins so that we will be made blameless in front of the Father. He died for you so you won’t have to live in that world that you live in everyday. It’s not the lifestyle we all were made to live. Over time we made corrupt lifestyles and turned our backs against God with the help of satan. We allowed satan to control us, that’s how this world came to being corrupted ; It’s inside of the world God created for us. But “if we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us ours sins and  to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” 1 John 1:9 KJV. If we repent and confess He promise that He will save us from all and everything that harms us. All you have to do is have faith and trust in Him. If you don’t trust how are you going to receive his gracious gift? Would you rather trust in this evil world we’re it’s only purpose is to destroy you or The Only True living God that’s wants to see you thrive and have an abundante life? He doesn’t want anyone to perish (reference to 2 Peter 2:9), but to have a life with him eternally. Turn, repent, have faith, believe, trust, put down your life for him and He bring you up and give you a new one. Jesus will wash you with His clean blood. He loves you too much for you to live in destruction and despair. He doesn’t want you to be in your head everyday worrying or you being confused and depressed. Nothing will provide comfort or protection nor peace nor help in this world but Jesus. You don’t need a girlfriend or boyfriend to please you or to feel “loved”. If you want to feel and know what actually love is, Jesus is all you need, “he is the only way, truth, and life”( John 14:6). He loves you dearly more than anyone❤️❤️❤️❤️

Hi btw Here's a quick and easy recipe for a delicious milkshake: Classic Vanilla Milkshake Ingredients:  * 1 cup (240ml) cold milk (whole milk works best for creaminess)  * 2 cups (about 4 scoops) vanilla ice cream  * 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, for extra vanilla flavor)  * 1-2 tablespoons sugar (optional, adjust to your sweetness preference) Instructions:  * Combine Ingredients: Add the milk, vanilla ice cream, vanilla extract (if using), and sugar (if using) to a blender.  * Blend Until Smooth: Blend on medium-high speed until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If it's too thick, add a splash more milk. If it's too thin, add another small scoop of ice cream.  * Serve Immediately: Pour into a tall glass
THE GOAT CORY LETS GO. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Coryyyyy
PLAY ELDEN RING NIGHT REIGN
Should be no reason why I’m stressing out more than Cory, and I’m not even playing the game 💔
1 hour gang 👇
WHERES SSS
I wanna point this out incase if anyone notice..  When Cory was using the object power up thing the remote looks like the one from Security Breech Chapter 2 when the girl was powering down the animatronics.  When Cory found the first prize and when he said "Roxy" it reminded me of Roxane the Wolf.  When Cory went to that one room before meeting Jackie and the whole in the wall the place looks similar to Amanda the Adventures but with more doors and items (chapter 1)
Up down up down
10:49 sign this man to a label
2:43 He so real because I was just getting my water and snacks and I am sitting here smiling ear to ear excited asl 😂😂

23:20 so you cussing now?..
Love your videos every time they come out but always disappointed to see a new video and its not being a series that was started but never finished
1:07 idc the hair looks tuff
So this is a night at Freddy’s game it doesn’t look anything like it but OK but like he said it brings sick memories good luck 1:16 Fnaf is just crazy. How are you gonna start a new game in another game I thought it was done but never mind.😅 1:40 try to get chilled out over here I don’t need a bottle of water lol you need to chill out bro seriously chill out, bro. You have to go wild bro like what’s going on your that’s excited I wanna be excited. I would’ve been scared. I would’ve said no. 2:35 i’m not excited I would’ve been scared because you never know it was gonna be scary scarier than it was before they animatronics give memories, even if they’re new they still give memories as the old animatronics
THANK YOU CORY🙏🏽🙏🏽

23:06  "Yeah I'm black, I'm not just gonna sit there and let you power up.." New iconic saying for our boy 🤣
23:16 one of these days Cory isn’t gonna cut it off
It feels illegal to be this early to one of his videos
LETS GO CORY PLAYING SOME FNAF GAMES!! ts been a while since he’s done anything fnaf related, so I didn’t expect steel whool to send him an early copy of the game!
This was 🔥 Cory lets see part 2
Hey Cory been watching since 2012 I'm a grown man now and I wrote a book and still watch you your a legend man all love
I feel so bad for Arnold. His voice sounds so tired let the man sleep
1:40 do NOOOOT be disappearing like that cory. before i have to do something about it. watch out
What u mean are you into that when you were talking about Roxy? 12:15 Mushoku tensei?
No Corey why did you take your twist outside
Here before the like goal cuz at four hours it’s at 233k we ready for the next episode 😅🤩
yo cory, you gonna play persona 4 revival when it comes out?
This new game kinda scary because the mimic could be any robot 😅
Am I the only one here who is seeing the cams 💀💀💀💀💀
Just had to make the craziest decision of my life bro, watch Cory play this, or wait till Joe Bart plays it. You know what I chose.
“They grab a cardboard box put a smiley face on it and call it boxy.” Who gonna tell bro💀
my name is edwin i made the mimic
YESS YES YES YES MY KING CORY
bro cory what is your hair growth products i need that😫
I just thought about it and what if the guy that Cory is playing as (I forgot his name-) is Cassie’s dad? In “FNAF: Security Breach: Ruins” Cassie explained that the thingy (again, I also forgot what it was called) was the same as her dad’s. BUTTTTT don’t blame me if I get this wrong, it’s just a random thought 😭  Edit: Okay maybe this is dumb idk 😅
I just got an advertisement my lord
37:21 did bro forget about number 1 crate in fnaf 6💀😭
1:38 gonna be real active you say alright I’ll quote you on that Cory

Cory you forgot the code it was on the wall there where number every were
Maybe I'm reaching here the person that you're talking to in the game is actually the endoskeleton I don't think real guy because of Five Nights at Freddy's security breach I don't know it could be a theory a game theory
cory uploaded on my birthday!!
Cory the numbers on the walls
Cade Cunningham?
I'll be honest one day early to only play to a length feels really pointless might as well just have everyone wait until the next day
For people wondering I believe he is on his afro bc this gameplay was recorded before he got his braids.
security breach (same creator ik) x poppys playtime vibes
To be frank, this take place in the 70s so 25$ is some pretty penny (prolly not worth your life for tho )
15:58 i MIGHT be reaching but i think thats a ddlc reference 😭

Yo bro, what is your jet

What's killing me is you haven't played, Security Breach "Ruin" DLC BEFORE playing this game. You would have made some crazy connections @CoryxKenshin and I'm sad about that, so yeah, I'm sobbing rn.

LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION ARE YOU READY FOR FREDDY 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Still haven't played ruin fnaf🥀
Bro is it just me or is fnaf not fnaf anymore, this shi look way too much like poppy playtime. Like although yeah it had some decent tense segments I feel like fnaf just aint scary anymore, they lost their sauce
28:40 who's Into it or intwin, I don't know if I'm spelling his name right but I can't find him, but can someone tell me who he is and why I can't find him absolutely anywhere??

Under a day
1M views in 3 hours is crazy. But it’s Cory so very understandable
This isn't even remotely similar to fnaf at this point but I'm still happy for Cory
how did he not see the numbers
14:53 If Fredbears Family Diner is open, its around the 1970's, where 25 bucks is worth more like 200, which still kinda sucks for risking your life.
cory u are so beautiful
Cory I really appreciate these consistent uploads but issa lotta games you have series rn and I definitely remember what happened when you did this that one time 😊

Hey Cory, I know this is probably irrelevant and you might not even see this but I've been subscribed since like 2016-17 had all notifications, watched every liked every video you made and your last video you made and this one I got no notification from YouTube, come to find out I had been totally unsubscribed from the channel. I know its wasn't my doing and I don't really know how it happened, but it troubled me because I had been subscribed for so long and all of a sudden I wasn't. Idk what happened but hopefully you see this, love the content man keep it up
ur hair looks so good
The 25$ ain't enough for dealing with this 😔
WHERE ARE YOUR DREADS?

The last FNAF game he played was Security Breach. I would so watch him play Ruin, Help Wanted 2, and Into The Pit. I do hope that he plays those games one day.
I thought this was a fan game at first lol
Day 6 of asking Cory to play Doki Doki Literature Club that he started 1 video for but never finished, blow this comment up if you agree👍
Yo don’t you realize when he throw the mask at 30:44 that was when he didn’t like something in security breach that brings back memories 😢😢😢

3:40 I can't believe they kept old models like the fnaf 3 springbonnie (bonnie reskin) bobble head omgg
I ❤ your videos keep it up bro
Great stuff big fan! Happy to see you doing your thing again,
Hey cory, i know the game isn't as current but PLEASE do FNAF Security breach: Ruin dlc
Cory sometimes is the equivalent to playboy carti like bro comes back with crazy shi
he unbraided himself!?
I'm loving this hair!!!!
ALL MIGHT MENTIONED OOHHH 2 GOATS IN 1 VIDEO
23:55 speaking of re what you think of the re9 trailer
10:53 those animatronics really said “cut the cameras” 💀🙏🏽
🙏Jesus Christ is coming back soon 🙏 Amen PRAISE GOD. We must repent of our sins before it's too late "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."  "For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."           (Romans 10:9-10)
Days...idk, telling Cory to play Miside
YOU KNOW ITS BOUTA BE A GOOD DAY WHEN CORY DROPS
My goat 👑
hold on , Cory was very accurate abt the fiber and sugar !

Secret of the mimic looks good

"Yeah I'm black I'm not Finna just sit there and let you power up" got me dying!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Why did you stop playing Minecraft
Unsubscribing because Cory is not speaking up about ICE or Trump. How are you gonna post content, and think everything is going good in the whole world right now. For those who say “I don’t get into politics” Y’all are Cowards!! STRAIGHT UP !
HERE BEFORE 24H AND STILL LIKE BIDS
35:54 Cory is always moving in times of crisis
5:00 eh forget you can have my truck and keep yall pay im a sleep in this hollow tree right here and eat a squirrel
R.I.P my ears rn 😢
I’ve had a really bad day today and this guy always cheer me up and he has cheered me up with this video. Love you Cory❤❤❤❤❤
Been kinda worried bout my future lately feel like im my families last hope but Cory’s vids do help take my mind off the world for a while. N I thank u for that
yayyyy❤❤
anyone else immediately clock that Arnold is voiced by Kellen Goff? or just me 😭
17:04 creator clearance makes the shape of pixel Scott cawthon to me
Is the orange elephant Oracle from ultimate custom night and from Freddy fazbear's pizzeria
Maybe it is just nostalgia bias but I do miss the earlier games back in the scott era. This is great, don't get me wrong, but without the franchise in the title I honestly wouldn't think this had any association. The unique gameplay and atmosphere of the OG games was what made them so special in the first place (lore aside, obviously). Now every new fnaf game feels like something I've already seen before. Idk.
where's our "Up Down Up Down" :')
35:06 and 35:07 that elephant had moved
Springtrap really be always coming back
this is where the legend started
CORY DID YOU PLAY DARK DECEPTION CHATPTER UHH 5 OR IT ISNT OUT IT
THIS IS HOW I FIND OUT SOTM IS OUT
Samurai.. stand up.
You should do five nights at Freddy’s security, bro that one is my favorite one
3:56 bro I thought he popped them special pills 🤨
When cooking with cory coming
10:03 MONTY REFERENCE???
He played e gadd theme
You scared me Cory thought you were gone again
4:33  nah cus if it were me, I would have ended that call by now and headed home
CORYXKENSHIN PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FINISH THE SCARY CHRISTMAS GAME I MISS IT SO MUCH PLEASE PLAY IT!!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLAY IT I MISS IT PLEASE!!!!!!❤
Braid allegations where getting to him so he took out the braids.

"Look at your dumba-"😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤
Yu need to do another spooky scary Sunday because all these games are getting on my nerves. I really want you to do alone. I’ve been waiting for one. I’ve been watching all your old ones and they’re getting really old so do another one please.
25:09 R.I.P Cory, not even God could save him
His name is Edwin, and he made the MIMIC
Cory thank you for the birthday gift. I been hoping you would drop on my birthday. Today marks 13 years of being a fan of yours.
Is it me or does this game feel like it copied Poppy playtime’s homework? Either way it worked
I waited for your video because Fusion did his and I said, wait, let me watch Cory first because, "A game isnt a game till Coryxkenshin plays it." So hear I am. Also, Scott the GOAT Cawthon is a REAL ONE.
looking good corey 🫣
Oh yeah remember the fnaf movie
0:52  OML mha mentioned???
your videos will forever and always give me core memories cory
My bad
That afro reminds of old cory but more modernized with the hairstyle
Unc needs to stop reminiscing
3 hour gang👇🏼
LIKE THE VIDEO OMG
Lets do what we did with fnaf security breach
HE IS HERE
What happened to nonchalant dreadhead Cory 🥀💔
So handsome🤩😍🤭
That hair is everything god dayum😩😩😩. Never speak bad of your hair love💞💞.Its everything luv.
Man the mha scenes were fire at the beginning and than seeing both Cory and fusion Cory creator of the vid and fusion commenting both of my fav horror game YouTubers in one place heaven hit me.
And like button, I’m not trying to make you do it, but you can do if you want to
“You cant get in here, Look at your dumb ahh”😂😂
Cory: “this is kinda cool,it’s like a real thing”  Cory not even 1minute later: “alright I had enough let me out of here”
Not gonna lie this chase scene was way better than poppy playtime
His Afro looks amazing
So game lore a man named William afton and Henry Emily have a brand fazbear entertainment and the year is 1979 Edwin Murry a contarctor disappeared and the technology he was made for in his costume manar and Edwin son died in a car running over him
When he's says do not lose t you know we gonna be forced to lose it
Real fans Here  👇
Deelive was my goat back then cuh
omg i love the dispatch so much this is the best fnaf game so far
AYEEE THATS MY MAN MY MAN MY MANNNN 0:15
I’m surprised he hasn’t lost his voice😂😂😂
I LOVE YOUUU CORYYYY
I don’t know if that animatronic is a crocodile or an alligator but Cory definitely got flashbacks from Monty 😭
Binge you boy ong
What just happened?
Yoooo wasuup
when cory went to his fridge, i didn’t hear nothing THST MAN IS SO FINE
The fact that this might be the best series  of episodes  I'm  dieting to watch the rest of this
this is the great way to end the school day and use my study period to watch cory
heyyyyy
Cory is black and did indeed not let him power up
I just got here the second I didn’t wanna look at his acc😭😭
didn’t edwin make thsi
He’s so majestic in this video lawd
Finna watch yo shit boy
38:36 “I had to follow the pipe there’s a switch”🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️
Look at ya dumba-
14:40 Apparently the game is set in the year 1979 (according to google, im sure it'll be confirmed/debunked as time goes on). 25 Dollars in 1979 = 110.70 in 2025. Still shit pay but its better than 25
Cory I already pre ordered the second book I just want to know how many books do you think you’ll make
I already knew it
Yo Cory can we get an update on Ur dog

Yo Coryxkenshin remember the fnaf movie the scene when u were in the taxi?  Where to?" "Why do I always get the weirdos?"
unc im sorry but you sound like it no worrys
Imma be fr this is probably in the 1980’s, so that means that the $25 would be about $97. Should still be more though- whadduya mean I’m getting that for riskin my life while I’m half asleep dude 😭
Put the thing in ! 😢😂
Why does Cory always have issues with Gators in these games </3
I’ve been watching Cory since I was either 7 or 6
Gonna let this one marinate so I can binge all the parts

Keep it up and don't stop being the chosen shogun himself. LOVE YOU AND I'M A HUGE FAN MAN!!!!

I'm so happy you've started posting again, Cory. Your videos are amazing, and they always made me feel better when I was sad. I was so upset when you stopped posting. I'm really, really happy you started again. Really. I appreciate you and your videos a lot. Bless your soul. (I know this is a bit off topic, sorry about that!) This video was very funny, just like all of your other ones though! Thank you!

Hey guys How long have we been watching Corey for, I've been watching him since 2014

Just remember it's 1979 and your getting paid 25 dollars
Dispatch is clearly just a robot, right? He sounds too fake. Also, I would have kept a built-in bed in that van and slept before going in. If they want the job done, then I'm getting my sleep, lol.

19:40, wow, I didn't even pick this up, but the colour of the suit our guy is wearing is the same colour as the guy in the duck/dog suit in the previous scene! I think they must be from the same company! So... that's even creepier, how long has this 'Dispatch' been sending people here?? Hopefully our protag will get out...  Of course he will, because he's being played by Cory!!

the youtuber with a chicken is xxproclassgamerxx his last upload was 6 months ago his friend was dubbing over the footage and in the comments it says he is doing good for himself but does not plan to upload
His fro is so POOFY!!!
Poppy playtime vibes😮‍💨
Is it only me or the dispatch sounds like Hollow
11:05 had me cracking up 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
FNAF is almost always more fun to watch than actually play. But this seems especially boring, can't imagine this would have any replay value
Out of sight Cory!!! Play it next please!!
12:08 "where Roxy at😏" never knew he still had feelings for her after he bodied her in security breach
MORE FNAF YESSIRREE

My name is Edwin.
23:21 "Look at yo dumba-" —Cory 2025
The card board cut out making noise and Jackie begging for hugs…?? Are we sure this isn’t poppy playtime from temu? Where is the fnaf charm? Feels like an imitation
ITS TIME TO OPEN THE DO- *(cutely dies)*

You are such a joy to watch and growing up with you and your channel has helped me through some bad times. Whenever I get sad, I just go to one of your videos and always feel better. You are sooo funny and I hope you go even FARTHER in life because you deserve it. And I am so happy that you are doing very well and that your manga is going great. You are also the reason why I started my own Youtube channel. I love your channel Cory, and I always will :)  Love, One of your biggest supporters :)
Great content per usual keep it up 💯

Cory needs to play crow country
Fusion gets everything up super quick lol, it’s crazy 🤣
I wonder when the voice actor info coming out bc I may be TOTALLY off base, but he sounds like David Matranga(?? Sorry if I butchered the man's name). First few lines, off the rip, I'm hearing straight Tomoya from Clannad.
2:58 unc is being healthy nowadays.
25:01 made me laugh so hard 😂😂
Bro started running at you like a full back
Sorry for your lose
Afro Cory and fnaf memoriesss
its a good day when cory post, especially a part one
Kinda wished cory played this in VR, I miss his VR videos but I'm still happy to see him play this game either way
You got the same fridge as me
at 29:15, Cory mentions a fnaf youtuber who had a pet chicken that died. I think you're referencing xxProClassGamerxx. He had a pet chicken named Chica that later passed away. I remember watching him when I was young, always thought he sounded like FuzionZGamer.
I’m sorry but I just gotta say it. Cory is just so hot like 😭😭 idk if he has a girl or not but dang yall this man always fine
Under 3 hour gang——->
Was Cory talking about ProclassGamer? 29:23
The goat is back yesssir
HI

Oh baby that hair 😂 it will always be the most important thing ❤️
The guy you were looking for was named xxProClassGamerxx. He used to make videos with hist pet chicken chica but then it died and he stopped uploading much after that.
What happened to spooky scary sunday?

❤
Unc still reminding us about fibers 😂
This game actually might be fire it feels weird not having like any original characters except for that dude that talks to you the whole game and the mimic but that’s really it and it could jjst be the same va for the guy that talks to you and an entirely new character

I appreciate how whenever you leave, you always try your best to make it up to us when your back, and half the time you leave for us, to work on the monsters we make, or just to relax for a bit, which is unlikely, but understandable due to creating on YouTube can be stressful and overwhelming. Your content is amazing and the community that you impact is so positive. I can’t wait to see you become even MORE famous and successful, if you decide to continue, and I’ll always enjoy seeing your new content. Keep it up for however long you can, we all appreciate you.
25:09
10:03 Probably reminds him of Monty
GUYS IM TOO LAZY CAN SOMEONE TELL ME IF THERES ANY JASON REFERENCES ON THE GAME CUZ YOU KNOW IT WAS RELEASED IN FRIDAY THE 13TH
The day i decide to miss a cory upload is a pain
the almost instant mention of "Edwin" in the driving intro just pissed off half the fnaf community
Me relax you the one jumping up and down
Cory I got 2 cops today of your book one for my friend and me
AT  THE ELAPHANT
did you get a new afro :3
You gotta play the silent hill 2 remake
Cory the back of yo hair is turning square from leaning on that chair...

HEY CORY BUT YOU JST CUSSED
I'm 17, I used to watch Dlive, Entoan and Wade play little big planet all the time ❤
I can't lie to you, the game is good. My only thing is, it's a bit to much like poppy playtime. Child based character that kill people. Not to mention the talk to me boards which bring me back to poppy playtime 1-2 boards around the map introducing characters.
Pls do a buzzcut
Cory is going to do secret of the mimic, kindergarten 2, and 3. ALL AT THE SAME TIME, LETS GO!!!
RAAAAA WE BACK

Hey Cory, I just wanted to say thanks for everything you’ve done for me. Mental issues run in my family but this last year has been extremely hard for me. I’ve gone to two mental hospitals for self harm, suicide attempts and ideation, and more just within the past 6 months. However, whenever I would reflect to look on things that motivate me to keep living, your posts would always be one of the first to come to mind. Thank you so much for letting me have a laugh and having something to look forward to everyday. Thank you for incorporating God, even if it’s just a verse, everyday. Thank you Cory. For everything. Truly. You make me smile just when almost no one else can. Thank you for being my idol and encouraging me to become a better person for myself as well as a follower of Christ. I’m sorry that this is so off topic, and I apologize to anyone who I may have ruined their mood, but I just wanted to let you know, Cory, what your influence is having on people like me. You make me happy. You make others happy. You make God happy. Thank You Cory. I say this now in risk of it being too late later on.  Love you Cory!❤
Am I late?
The first three minutes is why I love you

Fusion is like the earlier version of Cory, I swear he posted 20 minutes after Fusion and I have to watch them both because you’re both amazing YouTubers to watch during a FNAF game.
23:22 look at ya dumb a😂😂😂
My heart always warms up when scott  coryxkenshin  friendship
CORYYYYYYT
And I was just about to go to his last vid and spam comment this
What happened to the braids Cory
swear you looked like Carlos Oliveira from RE this whole video, big hair, black fit i just see it so well
I’m not gonna lie in the beginning of the video I was just looking at bro’s eye bags😭
Hey CoryxKenshin! I've been a devoted fan for years, and there's one game that has been lingering in my mind: ‘At Dead Of Night.’ It’s hard to believe it’s been four long years since we last encountered the chilling character Jimmy. I would love to see you dive back into that haunting experience and finish what you started!
"Knick-knacks and doo-dads" only real ones know the reference
Bro still got beef with Alligators after what happened with Monty
Let's get this to number one in trending❤❤❤❤
Best feeling of eating McDonald’s and drinking a cold drink while watching CoryxKenshin🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
﴿أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللهِ﴾ ﴿وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ عَلِيًّا أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلِيُّ اللهِ﴾ "I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah." "And I bear witness that Ali, the Commander of the Faithful, is the Wali (Friend/Guardian) of Allah." I Wish Cory Become a Muslim.
cory!!!
Luv yur vids and sliced that like button as always
Bro I saw fusion but I was waiting for u
based on the search results, "Secret of the Mimic" is a Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) game centered around an animatronic called The Mimic. The Mimic was initially designed to care for Edwin Murray's son but became violent after Edwin's abusive behavior and the son's death. The game will be released on June 13th, 2025. It is believed that Jackie, the jester animatronic in the trailer, might be The Mimic in disguise, making her the first murderous robot seen.  btw edwin had a son it was to enterain his son
Coryxkenshin is back another video yessir 😊😊😎 I remember u playing this game in 2020
I was excited Im general that a new fang game was coming but my favorite YouTuber playing it is just so much better. Cory you really do amazing things to our lives❤ just keep going
Bro after 3 years we have fnaf back LET'S GOOOOOOOO
Been back for 5 months and bro already got 22.2m subs RIGHT AFTER hitting 21M HOWWWW
Where the braids at
The hair has grown sooo much ❤😍
Yessss part 2222222❤❤😂😂😂😂
MAKE ASSASSINS CREED SHADOWS A SERIES LIKE GOD OF WAR RAGNAROK AND GHOST OF TSUSHIMA
For the people who don’t want to search up how much he is actually risking his life for. The game is set in 1979 so $25 today would be $110.70 (or $116.55) in 2025. It also varies city, state and country.   Buddy is risking his life barley for $110 -$120
Im surprised that you're headphones don't shoot off you're head sometime's

Hey Cory, im so excited that you are playing fnaf Secret of the Mimic. I wanted to get your attention about the lines in 4:57-5:00. They directly reference the FNAF books that is about the mimic lore. I don't know if you read them or not but you should really check them out to get more lore about the minic and about Edwin

Cory is like that one school guy who goes to school the first week, disappears for the rest of the year, comes back NEXT year, and is there for the whole school term.  Also took me a bit but the jingle that plays when opening Jackie is the fnaf puppet song which is a really nice reference   Also also Rip Digityper😔 2025-2025
This is some of the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game, ever.
WE NEED BOXY FAN ART, MAKE IT INTO REALITY
take care of yourself cory, sleep when you need too, eat when you need too. Don't force yourself to make late nights <3

if you love Cory comment ❤ ⬇️
1 Peter 4:7  “The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self controlled so that you can pray.” Acts 2:38-40 “Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off- for all whom the LORD our God will call.” “With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.” Revelation 22:7 “Behold, I am coming soon! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book.”

3:56 my dumb ahh was about to say "look its a fnaf reference!"
Hey Cory, you posted this video at the right time because I been feeling down and I haven't been on good terms with my mother because we had been exchanging words to each other and I was starting to feel like ending it all. I know a YouTube comment section isn't the right place to open up but I been having my emotions bottled up for almost my entire life and your one of the only people I can really talk to even tho you dont know I exist.
29:18 unc miss the old times

W video right here
To answer your question at 14:53 this takes place in 1979
watch somebody make a beat outta 39:06
It's always nice to see gaming companies/DEVS recognize the very same gamers that put them on the map. FNAF blew up because of youtubers, and ten years later they're still showing their gratitude. That's mad respectable. 🙏🏾
5:59 did he nor hear the voice glitch it was the mimic
Nothing better than a FNAF Cory video
19:45 literally at applebees right now watching this😭😭❤
I heard Boxy once ended a whole village in west Africa

Man I wish you played fnaf security breach ruin then you would know who the mimic is
Cleanest freaking Afro we seen fr.
If Cory does start to post more (aka daily) MAYBE we could see a return in double uploads. But that’s a low chance tbh💔🥀
Now beyonce stuck in my head. Thanks Cory! XD
35:51 I don't wanna hear "he's really good at that puzzle". [Animatronic pulls up] "What the freak" 🫳🫴🫳🫴🫳🫴. "I did the thing" 😂😂
hello mr cory i love your vids bro i cant wait to play the new fnaf secret of the mimic cuz it comes out on my birthday and i wanna asked is it cool if you can give me a shoutout for my birthday on one of your vids or comments whenever you get the chance tho its no rush thank you so much mr kenshin love you bro and god bless man

CORY IS BACK IN FNAF YO!!! SAMURAI STAND UP!!! THE SHOGUNHIMSELF AND THE 4TH KING OF FNAF!!!
34:39 My name is Jacky and I'm fuckin' backie
17:50 They already have created such things. There is the "Trash and Gang" animatronics from Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator and also in UCN. For example, theres a literal vacuum cleaner with eyes and hands called "Mr. Hugs," others are "Bucket Bob", "Mr. Can-Do", "No .1 Crate," and "Pan Stan." So yes they will make and call anything animatronics XD.
Man Cory where all yo food at in ur  fridge, we need another episode cooking with kenshin!!!! 🔥

Doing the math 25 bucks in 1979 is like 106 in 2025 still not worth risking your life over but hey that’s fazbear for you

25:09 “NOOOOOOO” Got my dying
Lets actually enjoy this video and ignore the bots in the comments and those people who begging for likes as soon as a video drop.
Poppy playtime on steroids
Scott Cawthon really changed cory's life with the FNAF franchise. Got early access to every FNAF after FNAF 2, Got to meet the legend himself, pretty sure he donated over 5,000 dollars to one of cory's charity streams, then gave him a once in a lifetime opportunity to be apart of the first FNAF movie, and gave him a role as a taxi driver. Something tells me that Scott has something planned, something BIG, planned for Cory with the FNAF 2 movie since that's basically where their friendship started.
W cory
If you guys don't know who Cory is remembering at 29:07 their channel is called xxProClassGamerxx and I think the chicken was named Chica aswell that's all I remember👍
7:48 "Pardon our mess! *insert seal unc laugh* close your mouth?" & 9:44 "Alright this song needs some work" LMFAO.

Thank you for putting subtitles cory I was at a loud function and couldn’t hear the game
Yes Cory dropped 🙏🙏🙏
Daaang… didn’t expect Cory to be such an expert at that one puzzle. Just goin’ real fast wit it.
Idk if Cory ever realized but most of the calls that fazbear entertainment are more or less voice recordings it’s clear that they don’t give a poop about there employees and it shows when the dispatch says thing as if are mc is saying yes it’s like there not even listening or they simply don’t care…I feel like I’m reading a little bit to into it but that’s just the vibe I get
Hell yes
I couldn't watch a  secrets of the mimic video unless it was made by cory😂
Cory making jokes about him leaving our lives temporarily🃏 and saying screw you to my source of entertainment is like my dad leaving me when I was a baby😂😂
Thank you Cory!!! I was literally praying you’d get this and play it!

Were you doing the all nighter or something
For context: This game takes place in 1979. Edwin Murray father of David Murray owns MCM where he and his team are commissioned to make costumes for other companies, one of them being fazbear entertainment. Edwin was so busy with work that he didn't have any time to watch over David so he creates a program called the Mimic to mimic David and play with David. The program works so good that he makes an updated version of it, mimic 02. This version was mass produced and almost ALL of his inventions uses this code. One day, David and mimic 01 were playing like normal until David's ball rolls into the road. Long story short David gets hit by a car and dies. Edwin, in GREIF, takes it out on mimic 01 and hits it basically destroys it. Since the mimic mimics it mimics the abusive behavior that Edwin did onto it. After Edwin "griefed with the mimic" he ran away (thats why he's missing) Now All of the physical and digital mimics are learning to hurt and kill. Fazbear entertainment being greedy tells a group of ppl to go into the factory and retrieve the schematics of the mimic and other things. Long story short the mimic kills them all and tears their limbs off. Another group was sent in. Same thing happened. Fazbear has now resorted to a singular person, less deaths, that is you. The events of the game play out then after fazbear entertainment uses the mimic and other MCM owned characters for their brand, aka the Monty look a like, the Mr. Hippo look a like, the Roxy reference, and even the music man. I don't feel like typing no more low-key
10:03 monty reference . . .
DOES CORY RESPOND?
WHERE. THE FREAK. IS. KINDERGARTEN.
I’m giving you until next Sunday to drop a sss or you will face the consequences…. Don’t temp me

Ayyyyyeeee
Cory good at the generator game 💀
What oil you be using
I fell bad for people that have head phones on max at the time 11:55
“My name is edwin..”
Coryyyy
This game is sooo reminiscent of poppy playtime 1 and 2 it’s crazy
23:48 JACK WHO?! 🤣 🤣
I bet he'll finish the Minecraft gameplay series when he can too fasho
Nothing like Cory posting after having a bad day
THE GOATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Low-key wanna know abt this Chicken guy now🙏
21:39 I'm not risking my life for 25$ sorry but no
YESSSS
Arnold is so me
Corry can't be doing this to we have me waiting  for  a week to post a show not even for a hour 😢😢
Yesss
Aye mr. Cory imma slice that like button
One potential YouTuber you might be thinking of is xxProClassGamerxx.  According to a Reddit post, he had a pet chicken named Chica that passed away. After Chica's death, the YouTuber reportedly stopped uploading videos. The post mentions that this YouTuber was known for making Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) theories and gameplay videos. @coryxkenshin
37:06 poppy playtime chapter two vibes
Cory can you go back to some more of the older series like mk injustice happy wheels and guts and glory
Please play the other fnafs plz
As soon as he posted I was here😊😊😅
Cory remember to play security breach ruin
CORY POSTED ON MY BIRTHDAY LETS GOO🎉
My name is Edwin.. I made the mimic
Had a bad day today such great timing 😊
2:32 grown man by the way😂
10:04 course Cory doesn’t like the gator lmao
28:55 dlive and entoan were the OGs I used to watch their Gmod FNAF videos what a time to be alive❤

What up
Hey Cory on July 29th grounded 2 is out so if u wanna play it that's when it comes out
Cory's hair looks like Bob's from the Simpsons 😂
Jesus Christ loves yall. Acts 3 19-21
When Cory says he’s going to post daily 😪(all love) 🤣
Corys a D1 tugger
Unc real good at that generator part.. I wonder what he likes to do in his free time
1:02 Crazy to think how far the relationship between Cory & Scott has come. FNAF was definitely one of the staples that help Cory rise and get the attention and respect that he has now , and it didn’t take scott very long to be like   “Hey, this kid’s great - I like him. Gonna send him an early copy of every fnaf game starting from FNAF 2 onward because I like him & his content.”
Look at ur Dumb Ahh
Coryxkenshin, today is my birthday, my sweet sixteen, and seeing you post a video made me even more happier than I already was. I love your work and also plan on becoming a content creator myself one day. God bless you and all your days to come. Have a wonderful rest of your life.
Why do they keep giving him control of vehicles…

we are ready for freddy
0:48 So True, it everyime I wake up I go to my Xbox One
My name is Edwin. I made the mimic
Context: This game takes place before any of the games (1970's), set in Edwin Murray's facility. Edwin Murray in the books was tasked with turning the fabric suits from fall fest (a carnival owned by William Afton, into animatronics. Being an overworked father, he didn't have much time to spend time with his 4 year old son. So, he created the mimic. As stated in the office, it has the ability to  copy behaviors and personas of other people. However, one day, Edwins son got ran over by a car. But the mimic still copied the boys actions, making Edwin furious. In a fit of rage, he beat the mimic, tearing its body apart. But it survived, and now, it was copying Edwin's violent actions  against anyone it saw. Edwin disappeared, and fazbear entertainment went to collect what was theirs. The mimic was still at the facility though, and the people sent there were killed by it.

Real cory fans are here
i like cory's hair like that. kinda looks anime-y   edit: just finished the whole video and i gotta be honest, you look like a whole new person. im trying to tone it down because i recently discovered what backhanded compliments are but omg is your skin brighter than ever. im 18 with melanin drier than the sahara desert. and the twist out really made your hair pop out way more. i never thought id be watching a coryxkenshin horror video where my eyes are drifting on this man's appearance than the video, sorry if it still comes off backhanded.
OOOOOOOO HE SAID A BAD WORDD 23:19
Yo Cory you’ve made my Friday ❤ from Australia God bless you 🙏🏾

I was waiting for someone to talk about how fast he was using that mouse for the generator but then he did lol
your videos are the best to watch while eating some steak and water!
Cory Should Actually Play Indigo Park! This Video Kinda Reminded Me Of The Game :p
Do y'all think FNaF became a shell of its former self? Like the games are okay I suppose, but they aren't FNaF anymore, they lost all the charm and became generic walking from point A, grab something, go to point B and use that something while avoiding a goofy looking animatronic, I won't be surprised if Boxy became an actual animatronic. I really miss old FNaF that was actually unique and innovative and creative
54 minutes ❤❤❤❤
Something tells me that the dispatcher (4:12 and throughout the game) might be the Mimic the whole time. We'll have to wait for tomorrow once the game is released.

Do you every wonder why people take these jobs? Even if you don't know it's haunted, who's doing this? "Wanna repair nightmare-fuel animatronics alone in the woods?" "Sign me up!"  There is a reason these games don't have black main characters

ABOUT TIME MY MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER
36:21 how Hispanic mothers be when you don't wash the dishes
YESSSS
What is the gospel?  The good news that saves a person from the condemnation of hell is simply that Jesus Christ died for our sins, bleeding on a cross, then rising again from the dead three days later (1 Cor 15:3-4, Acts 10:36-43). He paid this ultimate price to offer you eternal life for free, not by your efforts or lifestyle reform.  What do I have to do in response to that good news to get saved?  There is only one thing we can and must do to be saved, and that is to believe in Christ (John 3:16-18).  Acts 16:31-32 …Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   If you believe in Christ just once, that he died and rose again to save you, then you have eternal life according to the Bible (John 6:47) and you cannot lose that salvation, no matter what (Rom 5:9, Eph 1:14, 4:30, John 3:18).    You must understand that to believe this good news, you cannot trust in your own works or good deeds as contributing even a small bit to your salvation. Do you believe that Jesus paid for all of your sins or that you also have to contribute? Either accept God’s free gift of saving grace and righteousness freely (rom 3:24, 5:14-18), or try to unsuccessfully work for it, but you cannot have it both ways (Rom 11:6).  Ephesians 2:8-9 8   For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  9   Not of works, lest any man should boast.
Please do schedule 1 part 2

Hi Cory
Under an hour gang  👇
I know entoan and dlive22891 i subscribe to there channels
CoryxKenshin Keep it up 👍
love the videos
Wasssuuppp!!!
Ok a 25$ gift card is about 110-116 dollars in today's world and the average individual salary yearly was about 10,507.27 back then. The hourly average pay was also 4.44 back then too. So basically a 25$ dollar card is basically a little less than 5 hours of work. Note all of this came from Google so might not be 100% correct.
I used to watch dlive play LBP those were the days
What if boxy got put in as a cory easter egg

I think it would be really cool if Cory played “What remains of Edith Finch” it’s interactive enough to be interesting and I think the story would have him be shocked at a lot of parts  Also it’ll be on sale for very cheap during the steam summer sale

1:43 YAY
Let's goo did he play ruin tho?
Ok, according to the game, SotM takes place in 1979, so $25 would be worth about $113. Still, not really worth risking your life over it, but it's FNAF.
Cory I love you ❤

yooo i’m early! so excited to watch this! we love you! and i wanna take the time to say thank you cory you’ve been grinding on monsters we make AND uploading for us please remember to take care of yourself and don’t stress okay? we can wait however long it takes we’ll always be here to tune in because WE as a community love YOU that’s why we’re here! Very proud of you and how far you’ve come! I was a late bloomer and found you during covid so i’ve been a fan for 5 years almost 6 BUT i always play and rewatch ur videos! You’re a staple in our household my brothers and i watch ur videos together whenever u upload! We love fnaf ESP ur fnaf series! So im super excited for this and also for HELP WANTED cause things will make sense if you know the lore behind help wanted once you play it! Which is why security breach may have been more confusing for some of the endings and such :) So i really hope to see you play help wanted after all these years cause its such a cool game lol ik this comment is long af so ur probably not even gonna see this but still on the chance that you do? Know you’re always loved by us no matter what you do you have an amazing soul may the odds forever be in your favor and i hope ur doing okay mentally :) CORY THE GOATTTTT

14:49 So based on the computer and other factors its most likely the 1980’s. Specifically 1985 or past it, so $20 back then is like $74.69 in today’s money. (Still not worth it in my opinion but $70 is $70)  Edit: 👆🤓

Hey Cory! Did you know that TinyBuild decided to create prototypes for Hello Neighbor 3? Hello Neighbor 3 is much harder than you expected. There’s details in the game,each house has an actual playable areas, and 3 different characters are active. But be careful with the AI’s, their abilities are crazy! Their homes are covered with many security cameras, puzzles, and other devices. Also, you can’t just go through the front door. You gonna have to be a little specific about sneaking into other people’s houses. STAY OUT OF THE FOREST!
my name is Edwin, I made the mimic.
WHO HAPPY CORY ON HIS FNAF ARC!

This man about to go back to the cave for the rest of the summer remember this moment
I knew this video was either coming today or tomorrow when it releases.  The fact that you got it days early.  I'm wondering if this game is better than Security Breach or if it's more of a linear horror experience than some empty open world.  Thanks for the video Cory!

This takes place somewhere in the 1970s, so 25 dollars back then should be a little over 100 dollars today. But yeah, it's crazy work to make a man work a 36-hour shift, then put him in a locked building with a homocidal robot for the chance to win 100 dollars. Fazbear entertainment stays disrespectful to their employees.

Appreciating Cory everyday that I'm alive, I was having a bad day and seeing this really helped me and made my day so much better. The lost of my uncle still affects me each day but seeing your videos remind me to never go back and keep pushing forward.  I’ve been watching your videos for a while now and you’ve always given me a laugh (or a jump scare) when I needed it. "Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you." 1 Peter 5:7 Many blessings to you Cory and your family. Thank you for all you do and brightening each one of us Samurai's day.

What year is it you risk your life for $25 🤣
Am I the only one who thinks Cory should play the popular Roblox Horror game “The Mimic”. I feel like I’d enjoy watching him do a playthrough, even people who don’t play Roblox like the Mimic, speaking from personal experience 😭. So Ig this is day 1 of asking Cory to play “The Mimic” form Roblox.
EARLY YAY OMG
Hi cory your my favorite  YouTuber when am sad u cheer me up and make me smiles  i hope on e day i can be just like u :)

I really enjoy your content (monsters we make is a w manga) and it has helped me get through a lot of dark times. Don't pressure yourself into playing games you don't want to. It's good that you share your limits with us so that as a community we can respect them. Much love, thanks for all you do!

No up down up down?
0:10 now that is funny
I really like the fact that you pointed out that you know why you lose interest in YouTube at the beginning, pressuring yourself to get through games you yourself might not really like. Or you just feel pressured to play at a faster pace really tires people out. I'm glad you can actually put it in the open that you understand your limits. So that we as a community can respect them. You're doing great Cory
cory i love you 🙏

new conoly kenshin video!!! 🍈
Not really related to the video but Modern fnaf is an enigma. On the one hand, it's still a pretty fun and a good time. On the other hand, these games aren't really horror games anymore, and there's something that the modern games are missing that the old games had
PLEASE play bramble the mountain king! It’s a gorgeous game and you played the demo a while back I really think you’d like it!
SSS? Where is it?

KING POSTED
I have been waiting nervously for a new post I was starting to tweak out for a sec😭
Hey Cory. I finished my A levels the other day, and I wanted to say that my mental health has taken a tole on me these past few days (Ive been struggling on and off for a few years). Your videos bring me and the samurai much love and joy in times of need. Your welcoming attitude to life has made me realise that i need to take care of myself more. So, ive decided to take the time to exercise (even if for just a bit) and believe in myself. Much love Cory and i hope this comment gives other samurai motivation to look after themselves and love themselves for who they are.
Holy lord I ain’t never been this early and WHERES KINDERGARTEN
1:45 gives me PTSD😂

Day 1 of asking for the next kindergarten episode
Reminder: Cory skipped Security Breach's RUIN DLC and Help Wanted 2, which this game helps to explain a lot of the unclear threads from those games. Since this game aims to explain those stories, experiencing this game before those might be the definitive way to play this game 😂
His hair growth😮

0:47  Not so fun fact about this song, the lyrics are sampled from a song called “Young Girl A” which was basically one of many pleas for help from the creator (Siinamota) due to their mental health deteriorating, eventually leading them to take their life, god rest their soul.

Please can you play dark deception, monsters, and mortals
Well😊
This looks GASS
Nik nacs and do dats
I really like the fact that you pointed out that you know why you lose interest in YouTube at the beginning, pressuring yourself to get through games you yourself might not really like. Or you just feel pressured to play at a faster pace really tires people out. I’m glad you can actually put it in the open that you understand your limits. So that we as a community can respect them. You’re doing great Cory
0:10 I already laughed. WE ARE TEN SECONDS IN. AND ITS ALREADY FIRE.
This video just changed my mood from upset to happy asf. Cory you always make my day so much better😌💕

For some reasons, i think Cory doesnt have the same energy as before since the last break. The tom scream is gone, his jokes arent like before, he doesnt have that comedy feeling like he used to. Still the shogun himself tho but i'll always miss the old Coryxkenshin.
CORY I LOVE YOUR VIDS THANK YOU FOR BEING THE BEST BLACK YOUTUBER

Hey Cory, my cousin died recently of cancer. I've been watching you since I was 10, or less, and I've introduced your channel to her, and she loved every video you've ever posted, she even bought me a "monster we make" manga sadly she died before she was able to watch any of your most recent videos, kindergarten, or your fnaf marathon. Thank you so much for bringing joy into my life and hers. Your channel brought memories through our relationship. Peace, and love ❤  Edit: Thank you all for the blessings and love. I hope you all have great day/night, and many more, love you family ❤  Edit 2: Don't give people like @Doaflip52 the time of day ya'll. What's given is reflected, love yall for respecting and defending ❤

"I don't wanna over promise, cause we know what happens when I do that" The scariest words I've heard uttered by this man😭
Cory 2 seconds into the game: “oh nah I need subtitles”  Cory 1 minute into the game with subtitles: “what’re you yapping about?!”

It’s always a good day when OUR glorious shogun uploads 🙏
Do another coryx cooking please
how dare YouTube hide this from me for more than 5 minutes
I can't wait to see him make more videos on this it actually brings me back to his security breach playthrough. I enjoyed that one, but I hope that this game ends up being a lot better. I hope that Dark Deceptions next chapter drops soon too so that he keeps dropping videos. Really excited for what's coming later this year (Or possibly the next if DD takes another year to come out with chapter 5 if it ever is coming out)  Also got to love how the person talking to Arnold just doesn't even give a care in the world about him or what he says. The voice actor really nailed the act. 😭
i'm watching this at 00:56
CORY!!!!!!
Cory Id love to see u do the VR games too.

Please Speak Up!!! An influencer with a huge following has power and the possibility to reach the millions of followers that listen to them. Staying silent on injustice shows a lack of empathy and integrity, especially when their voice could help raise awareness or drive change. Not speaking out often signals that they value their image or brand more than doing what’s right, WE want every influencer to speak up about the ICE situation rn.
Lesssgoooo

another fnaf video already gonna be a banger 🔥🔥🔥
41 minutes, Alr know ima enjoy this 😭😭
What
I just started the video but I just gotta say THE HAIR IS FIREEE
MY GOAAAATTTT
Bro I’m dead💀😭 (biologically speaking I am, in fact, alive. However, to emphasize how hilarious I found this, I made a hyperbolic statement saying that I was dead because it implies that I found this video so funny I ceased to live. However, I am indeed alive and well so there is no need for you all to worry. I was simply employing the tactics c of figurative language in order to better and more effectively communicate my message. Additionally, using slang and sayings commonly employed by the youth has made my message more understandable and reachable by the younger generation, many of whom are in this chat. For example, I could have said "that video was a real knee slapper". This would have made sense to some of the older people in this chat as knee slapping used to be a sign of hilarity. However, in this digital age in which we now live, knee slapping is not as common and many of today's youth may not understand the reference. I therefore made my message more understandable to younger people through my use of simple, easily understood slang. I hope this clears everything up, and I appreciate any concern that I was actually dead. I can assure you I am alive and well.)
100:03 was a crazy part of the video
Bro, how are there 5K comments and only 447 views like what?

MY FRICKING GOATTT😊😊😊
YO cory wsg hows your day so far
Coryyyyyyy can I get pinned pls im early and been a samurai
He uploaded as I was watching another video from him 😂
Please like so Cory can see this  Dear Cory,  Where do I even begin?? Well I guess I could start at the fact you’re never gonna read this 😭.  But on a higher note, the samurai is the BEST community ever.  You said “samurai stand up” and I was STOOD.  Your videos always make a bad day better, and make a good day greater.  Man even my DAD will watch your videos w me.  He acts like he’s not that interested, but trust he is.  I started to watch you around 2021 when my best friend introduced me to your channel. (We love my bestie, shout out to her)  but anyway when you came back I was SO freaking happy bro.  Could you not I was screaming, yes I know, a bit much.  But that was my first time experiencing you leave for a while so yea.  Thank you so much for doing what you do, I think I can speak for everyone in the community when I say we love you. Not in a weird way ofc (that Ik of 😭).  But thank you so much for being the weird, silly person you are, bc your silly weirdness matches the communities, and we appreciate you so much. You know when you talk to us in your videos sometimes? I’m not sure If im supposed to speak back or what, but I do anyway 😭.  ANYWAYS you should definitely play this game call dollmare or something like that.  You should at least TRY to play the mimic on Roblox if you haven’t yet.  Thank you for your time, byeee. (Update on Sam & momo??)
This dubs

To the individual reading this, please quit overthinking everything, day and night. Stop obsessing over your failures. Stop doubting yourself and start seeing the greatness in yourself as well as others. You are better than that. You deserve more. Start showing up differently for yourself. Believe in yourself. God will never hand you something you cannot handle. You are a star in this world. May God bless whoever sees this.
