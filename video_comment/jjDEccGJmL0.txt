Taylor and Soph, watching you has brought joy back into my life. Thank you for letting God lead you to share your laughter and more with us.
Taylor is an awesome girl Dad! ❤ CONGRATULATIONS
Congratulations 🎉
Congratulations guys 2 girls that will be sweet
Taylor and Soph I was super nervous when yall was about to opening the wardrobe. i love yall ❤
Congratulations
🎉
Congrats 🍾 and Taylor was right again  He is the perfect girl Dad and he is married to the girliest girl
This is the most sophisticated and perfect gender reveal i have ever seen. Massive well done to you both and was amazing to see Mary Mahryn being so included with her special little basket. She honestly is a credit to you both and you both are the most amazing, caring, loving, fun parents ever. Both girls are so blessed to be given the chance to have such a wonderful family. Its very exciting to see what god has for you both on your journey in the future days, weeks, months and years down the line. Congratulations again on another baby girl. Taylor is more than ready to be a girl daddy and we can see very clearly the love he has for you all. Stay safe and take care of each other 🩵🩷🩷🩷 x
AWESOME gender reveal!! 🤩
Congrats🩷💖
I love this ❤Thank you for glorifying God 🙏
I’m not crying you’re crying ❤❤❤congratulations guys!!
The male predicts the gender of the baby so I would believe Taylor everytime. My dad told my mom he wanted a boy first and girl last and he didnt care what gender or how many in between. And he got just that. My bro in law said my niece was a girl before she got here and that is what I guessed as well but everyone else guessed boy. I think he predicted correctly on all 3 of his children. They are the same as me and my siblings. Boy and 2 girls.
Congratulations!
💓💞💕💗💝💘💖💓💞💗💝💖💘
I knew it was gonna be another girl 😅
Taylor was meant to be a girl dad let’s be real 🎉
Awesome, congrats guys :)
I have 3 girls and it’s the best thing that has happened to my husband and I ❤

Love you guys. I love that you love Jesus. We do, too. That's awesome.
Congratulations
Very unique and beautiful gender reveal! Congrats you too and to big sis!!
How far along are ya? It feels like you just found out that you’re expecting. 😳
my sister is 2 years younger than me and despite the regular sibling discussions, we've always been really close. but now that we're both young adults we're best friends and partners in life. there's nobody i love more in the world and nobody i feel more like myself with than with her. a sister is truly the very best thing a girl could ever have❤
My coworker was told girl had to have an emergency c-section and it was a boy. It can happen unless they did a blood draw to identify the gender ❤
congrats guys
i follow some other youtubers that just done their gender reveal and they did bracelets blue and pink and one opened the envelope and then put the color of what was in the envelope on his wifes wrist it was pretty cool its the beaston fam
I guessed a girl
The setup is so cute. Yay!

💯🤍SUPER PERFECT BEAUTIFUL FAMILY 🧑🏻‍🦰👩🏻‍🦰👧🏼👶🏼💪🏻🧠⚡❤️🔥
Congratulations 🎉 so cute. My daughter was born in 2006. However, every ultrasound showed boy parts clear as day.  So HIS name was on the wall of the nursery, all clothes were washed and ready for baby boy, everything.  My sisters face during delivery was complete shock. In a panic, I started yelling what's wrong, what's wrong. She says..... it's a ......girl, we all erupted in laughter as my insides were sitting on my chest (c-section). It is a moment I will never forget.  She is now 19.
They are either going to be best friends or worst enemies like me and my sister 😂. I rlly hope they become besties tho.
Congratulations!
Actually, that’s wrong if it comes back girl, it can be wrong because all babies start off as girls and then either develop into a boy part. Are they keep their girl parts I don’t know if you knew that, but I hope it stays the gender that you want it to be and that y’all have a healthy and wonderful pregnancy
Congratulations guys ❤
Absolutely LOVE this for you guys! Yall are truly a light in this world and are so precious! Congratulations on growing your beautiful family ♡♡♡
I love Taylor for saying “My wife dressed me today!” I’m so happy for you both! Also it’s so great to have a sister you can bond with! Built in BFF for life! 💞💞
Yayy💙

Me and my husband have 3 little girls ❤ they are a blessing from God that’s for sure. We couldn’t be any more happier with them. Congratulations on your other little princess being added to your family. ❤❤
Congratulations to another baby girl
These people are living in a false  reality. Nobody is happy all the time and honestly more people would like to see that you are normal and not a pretend to be happy robot. Not saying that couples can’t just mostly be happy, But to overreact about every little word is just crazy. Sophia is bad about it but Taylor is horrible about it. Stop being fake. You can still make good money and be real.
They turned the comments off on their video because they know this shit of posting it all but the end and telling people to go to YouTube pisses  people off. As if they don’t make enough money.
Congratulations ❤ I’m due in September and I just found out I’m having a girl
Congratulations 👏🎉❤❤❤❤
Congrats I’m so happy for you both ❤❤❤
Congrats it's a baby girl ❤❤❤
Congratulations to you all .

HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY SOPH 🌺
Awwwww Congratulations
Ok blood test early can totally be wrong I had a very good friend who did the blood test and she hey where positive it was a girl because the blood test showed girl but at 20 weeks they found out it was infact a boy
So thrilled for y'all!  God is great💕
Aiyla Grace is a cute name  (Eye-la)❤
Congratulations 🎉 so happy for yall!! The decor was beautiful ❤❤
Congratulations!!! It’s usually opposite! If it comes back boy early- it’s usually accurate especially if they see the Y in the blood or the boy parts on a sonogram. Since you’re a females you wouldn’t produce a Y chromosome on your own. But if they say girl super early, especially on sonogram- the girl could always grow boy parts ;). Happened to a friend of mine! And many others I’m sure. Once they told us boy (and we saw it even at 14 weeks) I always knew it was accurate, but a girl needs to be confirmed on ultrasound 18-20 and then you can know for sure! ❤ either way- a blessing. 🎉🎉 they’re gonna have the best sister bond!
Congratulations
Congratulations guys,another healthy princess. ❤🎀
“Jesus is the Everlasting Father with compassion for His children. He pities his children and shelters them with His love (Psalm 103:13). His mercy endures forever and you can anticipate his forgiveness with joy. Above all, these benefits are yours to enjoy for eternity, if only you surrender your life to Him” WHOA THATS GOOD! THANK YOU JESUS!
I guessed it. I  just knew it would be a girl 👧 🩷🤍. Congratulations
Congratulations!!! Sorry Taylor you’re outnumbered for now 😂🩷
For anyone who doesn't want to wait its a girl! As cute as it was I just wanted to know the gender. So I fast forwarded it. Im not patient.  Congratulations!!
Congratulations and best wishes to you all!  God bless and keep y'all all your days! 🕊️🙏🏻💕🕯️🍼👶🏻
So so so precious!!! Congratulations you guys !⋆˙⟡♡ sweet baby girl !
Congratulations!!! 💗💗💗
I had the exact same thought about not being able to comprehend what another boy would look like when I was pregnant with my 2nd. They look soo similar it’s crazy! And the bond that they now have (2.5 & almost 10m) is absolutely amazing!
You all are absolutely wonderful! God's favor is all over your lives ❤

Congratulations on your baby girl 🩷 When I was pregnant for my son 10 years ago they told me that he was a girl at 17weeks. I went back at 24 weeks and ended up having a boy. My niece is 28weeks pregnant right now and at 16weeks it said she was having a girl. Today she went in for an ultrasound and yep she’s now having a boy. I feel so bad for her because the nursery is pretty much done with pink and little woodland animals.
Congratulations to you two wonderful precious parents on your new baby girl. God is good and powerful. Amen 🍼🧸🌸🩷🎀🍭🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🦋🦋🦋

Such a blessing to have another baby girl 👏🏻💞🌷God is so Good all the time!! Congratulations 🙏🏻

on our second son the ultrasound imaged we were having a girl but our eraser swing test showed a boy, needless to say we purchased all girl merch. boy did we learn a lesson, congrats to all and Blessings😇
The "blessing" of having a daughter is often viewed as a divine gift, representing the potential for future generations and the unique qualities women bring to the world. Congratulations to you both 🍼👶👣🤰
CONGRATULATIONS!!!! I AM SO HAPPY FOR YA’LL!!!🩷🫶🏻

I’m just so excited for y’all. I knew it was gonna be a girl. I kept saying girl and I’m so excited I was right lol!! Your mom has the cutest decorations that she does and is so talented. I love how she decorated the inside of the armoire. I’ve never seen that done before. And it looked so good. 🎀🎀🎀. Mary Mahyrn is gonna be the best big sister and I pray she and her sister will be the best of friends always. You and Taylor are such amazing parents and you’re gonna make another baby girl have the best life by having you guys as her parents. All praise to Jesus and praying for a healthy pregnancy a healthy baby and an easy healthy delivery. 🎀🎀🎀. Now since you’re doing October, I guess that means the Christmas tree has to go up in September. 😂😂
