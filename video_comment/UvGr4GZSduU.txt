the WHOO-ing at food gets me every time
Do you seriously not know who Des Linden is? She's an olympic marathon runner.
Tapering is bunk science. That’s why you got a shin splint.
i'm high right now and 4:28 had me laughing for the last 5 minutes
6:37 I ate more fettuccine Alfredo, and drank less water, than I ever have in my entire life.
the way Kelsey said yes to pizza is how we all feel
tha puppppersssss...
try myofascia relief with a tennis ball. it changed my life forever and you will never get shin splints or numb feet again
I just ran my first marathon this past weekend. It was such a beautiful experience. Cody you are so inspiring, this is such an amazing accomplishment!!
10:36 creaming their pants
Kelsey’s face at 9:38 😆😆😆
Woah! My foot also goes numb randomly like that when I run! It’s soooo agitating!
19:53 idk how to tell you this....but if both your feet are on the ground at the same time you are walking not running. Ahahahah
The pictures at the end 🥲🥲🥲
16*29 Uzi n carti album
Why you cussing so much? 😬
So proud of you Cody! Truly have pushed a lot of people to be better for themselves so thank you! Took this as a sign to get myself back up again! Got injured in the military but loved running with everything and this got me back into pushing myself love the energy thank you for just documenting your process you’re a fucking goat
i find it so motivating and healthy how you eat intuitevely Cody with racing, because its crazy how people think eating bland or very "strictly" is how it should be. More power to you, your bettering my relationship w/food and exercise. ultimately it is all about balance.
I’m doing the Canberra marathon this April as my first after four halves. This makes me so excited to get to the finish line!
Good work tyler
The random 6:41 at mile 17 gets me...overall nice race tho. I think if you rattled off more miles at a steadier split (i.e 8:30ish) you could have broke 3:40.
saw you at mile 24! Congrats on the sub 4
The pizza box on the bed is crazy
Three months ago, I watched a Cody Trains video & now after training everyday I’m running my first half marathon tomorrow!
What do you use to track your runs?
Bring a wheelchair next time when you are finished your race you are able to rest!!
great time wow!!
love this ! i was watching on tv :) I entered the lottery this year and wasn't picked but you're making me inspired to enter the lottery again for next year!
Codyyy!!! You are insane my man love all of these videos. You inspired me to get back into running. Im on strava trying to get back into form would love if you could follow!!!
way to ko cody go
good work tyler<3
Honestly really loved watching this video but holy shit Cody please stop eating into the mic I’ll pay you to stop
Having to walk a mile and a half with no fanfare is hands down the most NYC thing ever
I just did my first marathon last weekend, I came out of it with a stress fracture but already can’t wait until my next. Hoping to qualify for Boston next year! Congrats and keep being an inspiration! You’re crazy
i need this man to do a runDisney race asap
I put my phone on the table and my brother asked if I was watching a gay festival 💀💀💀
jeff said u did 3:48 so wtf
Do the Boston marathon so I can see you
Brooo Des Linden won the Boston Marathon in 2018
about to start running just so i have a better chance of meeting cody
What! I was in NYC that day and we stopped in Central Park to see some of the runners. Had no idea you were there!!
Come run in Pittsburgh. Our city loves it and there’s hills galore. Definitely a fun challenge. I’ll be running my first half marathon there in May. You inspired me to sign up.
did I hear a motherfucking brazil reference?????
Congratulations on the run! Been a long time fan. You are so inspirational.   I HAD TO COMMENT because the numbness in your leg may be because of something called exertional compartment syndrome. May be worth looking into!
Brooks should’ve send train whistles :/
Cody do the El Paso marathon in February 🤠
I poop once a week, but it's a good 10lb poop. Pooping every hour, I would never get anything done.
not the intimate view of cody slurping and gobbling up the creamy pasta😩
Why did I laugh when the tik tok thing came up at the end
11:10 It is really aggressive to try and do a 45 second negative split on a marathon. Trying to have your fastest miles in the 14-21 mile window doesn't really make sense because they are typically some of the hardest miles.
i signed up for a half marathon! it’s in a month and a half and i’m not the best shape but IDC i’m gonna choo choo the whole way 😂🚂
hey so i have referred nerve damage from lumbar/tailbone spine surgery that affects my left shin. often shin splints are referred pain/messed up signals from the back/hips so id suggest working with PT to stabilize the hips/lower back !
Cody I ran my first ever marathon last Sunday in 3:43. You inspire so many of us. You are the goat. We all love you!!!
Can confirm that I was one of the people to tell choo choo at Cody
Hey Cody!! You and this channel may have saved my life. I was gaining so much weight and now I’m 40lbs lighter. Playing my childhood sport and also running.   Was supposed to have run a half marathon a few weeks ago. Unfortunately I tore my ACL playing, soccer and just had surgery today. Feeling pretty low do you have any tips on how to keep my cardio and health up while I recover from this? I’m afraid im going to lose all my progress
I don’t think I have ever enjoyed food as much as Cody does.
A beanie? Cody, you're from Canada. Shame on you
Pooping 1 time per hour is crazy
Cody not knowing who Desi linden is is sending me. Love you though Peeves
One thing I did that helped shin splints while running was standing up while tying your shoes. Your foot is a different shape with all of your body weight on it, so if you tie your shoes on a bench or lift your leg up to tie your shoe, you'll probably over tighten. Put all of your weight on the foot you are tying your shoe makes a big difference.
be careful with the numb foot, I got it in a race and over a year of running its got so bad that it happens every run. get your physio to check piriformis syndrome
Eat bananas for shin splints! Potassium helps :) eat one the day before and one the day of.
Who’s Des Linden??!! 🤦
lets go Cody
DES LINDEN IS A QUEEN !
Mans said who’s des linden
You should look into the Fargo ND marathon next summer for a record time! Extremely flat elevation! Will be my first marathon all inspired by you! June 1 2024
I watched you run past mile 25! Way to go Cody, choo choo!
the cowbells were essential tbh 🔔
I ran the New York marathon too as my first! I flew from Australia to do this race and it truly was the best experience ever.
Cody did you see me and my 6 pugs? They each had a sign that said C-O-D-Y-K-O. My pugs also like to wear the Brooks Go Smacks. #1 athletic shoe for pugs.
my feet also go numb when i run long distances! i have no idea why! i hate it!
#50 on trending, that's wild. Congrats with the success on the side channel
I woke up late for the chevron full marathon and I was the last person to cross the start line and by the time I was done with the thing they already took down all of the events stuff :/
Tibialis raises bro! Trust me, I'm a personal trainer.
From all that salt in your shirt, I can tell you need to take in HELLAAA SODIUM 👍🏾 look into it so you don’t hit the wall that hard 🥹 great job out there 🙌🏾
A lot of cumming jokes 😂😂
Race report is a weird way to start a sentence Cody
I made the ultimate decision to spend my senior year of college at home for my student teaching, and to keep myself busy, I knew that I needed a more active hobby (with the inspiration of these videos), so I started running. I do have one friend who is home with me, so we have been running together and decided to train for a 10k. Since it was our first race and beginning of our running journey, our goal was a 12-12:30 pace just so we were sure we would be able to complete the race without walking. Our time ended up being 1:07 with an average pace of 10:54/mile. Now, we are training for a 15k coming up in January, and our average mile (when distance running) has gone from 12 minutes to a little under 11 minutes. These videos are the reason I am still challenging myself, so thank you and keep inspiring(: 🚂
I love Kelsey finding out the struggles of needing to poop before a race 8:31
Gonna ignore the part where you asked who Des Linden is lol.... anyway, congrats from MA! Now when are you running Boston? 👀👀👀
Congrats on the marathon! I ran my first marathon in October and I wish I would’ve chose a more popular one. I think that would’ve definitely helped my mindset lol
huuuuge - you should do the paris marathon, i hear it's gorgeous
Amazing well done
Kelsey is THE MOST supportive person… I have always just wanted to be her bestie. I hope she has the best time being a mom!
Kelsea lookin properly dicked in the first couple minutes. grats on the pre race sex bro. Hope your nips are ok.
I wish the video was 26:20 minutes long
Any time my Heart Rate hits 170, I know I'm going to bonk if I don't cool it. You were at 180ish for 6 miles... Crazy!
Good job sponsored boy
If you do CIM marathon you'll run through my home town!!!
You were a big reason that I decide to sign up, train for, and CRUSH my first 5K in September. Thanks for sharing this kind of content!
shake that ass for drake, then shake that ass for MEEEE
dude we literally started in the same wave and finished within 6 seconds of each other. hit the wall at the same spot... brutal!!!
so insanely proud of you cody!!!
GORRR CORRDYY!!!
That first bridge messes everyone up.. killed my calves
My PRs 3:10.. im running the Miami marathon in 10 weeks hopefully I can break 3hrs wish me luck 🤞🏻
SO PROUD OF YOU CODY
Choo! Choo!!
I ran my first half marathon with a PR of 2:07!! Thank you for inspiring me. I had a blast. Signed up for my first full marathon next year!! Choo choo!
would you say that the energy of the marathon was... EVERYTHING?
cody would say a can of coke
Congrats Cody!!!! So happy for you! Good job
Bet you won’t come run the Chicago Marathon with me
Congrats Cody! I just wanted to say that a little over a year ago all I could run was a 14 min mile. I was out of shape, unhappy, and disappointed. Granted, I started my journey before this channel, but your videos have helped me make progress. I'm 20 and I've gotta be able to keep up with an old man like yourself. I can now run an 8.15 min mile and I run at least 5 miles a week. While it's not much, I'm proud of how far I've come and grateful to go even further. We ascend together🔥
Who’s Des Linden? The US Olympic Marathoner?? Really
It's a good thing you didn't take the Tylenol! Just saw a study about people running marathons on NSAIDS and so many end up in the hospital from stomach bleeding! Supplementing ginger showed better results but you basically need to pregame it for a couple weeks for the anti-inflammatory effects to work. Hope that might help anyone who starts hurting after a taper. 🤞 Even too sedentary of a rest day sets me back bad 😮‍💨
Kelsey is right that is a CRAZY pre race meal.
Cody!! Run the Boston Marathon! I go to college in Boston and Marathon Monday here is such a huge event. You would love it 🙌
CHOO CHOO this entire journey has been so amazing to see
Watching this while folding my laundry because if you can run a marathon I can fold my laundry
God Jeff is so good looking
16*29
So…see you at the Austin marathon in Feb? 👀
congrats and everything but watching/listening to you eat anything makes me want to inside-out my skin.
Cody yelling at food will never not be funny to me
You should do the Boston Marathon! The whole state gets behind that race, it means so much to the city and represents so much of ever since the Boston Bombing.
Watching this before bangin out an 18 miler today 😱 scared but I know energy is everything and I will do it
chicago is flat as can be so if you want another world marathon that’s the one for a fast day
Des won Boston you philistine
Gor Cody
Cordyyyy ran my first half marathon on Saturday and was Choo Chooing the whole way. Thanks for the motivation never thought I’d be a runner but it kinda rocks
I volunteered at the med tent past the finish at the NYC marathon last year, and they make you keep walking by design so that people don't bunch up at the finish, like you said, but also because the #1 reason people pass out after a marathon is they stop moving and the blood pools in their feet  I happened to see you run by when I was on the sidelines in Brooklyn and yelled at you, I'm glad you had fun!
killed it peeves
PR at the Chicago Marathon in October
Des Linden is just a casual Boston Marathon winner, and also recently set the Masters American record in the marathon. NBD. Just another Brooks runner.
A good job Cody! I’m 29 just had a baby I wonder if I could run the NYC marathon?
Run the Boston marathon, we all cum for that race too!
I’ve been training for a 5k happening on November 23rd. My goal is to do it under 30min. It’s been difficult because my asthma slows me down. But watching Cody just keep going keeps me motivated honestly. So thanks Cody 🎉🙏🏼
boston marathon next king
i think i saw too much in the pasta clip
Giving me the motivation to get my act together for the sub 3! 😂 congratulations on the finish, love the videos!
Please look Des linden up man!! She freaking rules 🙌
‘Who is Des Linden’ hurt
CHOO CHOO! Way to go Cody! Keep crushing it and being an inspiration! Because of you I signed up for my first Ultra and funny enough I did the same one you did in Calgary, the Iron Legs Ultra!! Never would I have imagined myself running for that far and enjoying the experience. I just signed up for my next Ultra, 50M, in May. It’s going to be tough but together we CONTINUE ASCENDING! 🚂🚂
Congrats Cody!!!!! I think I said this last time but the shin splits are glutes and hamstrings not activating properly. Do some hip thrusts or banded marches I promise it will help you.
My feet also go numb sometimes and it feels so ridiculous because how are my feet numb when I’m running on them
hell yeah cody! but if youre pooping once an hour get that checked
“Who’s Des Linden?” *cries in runner*
died a bit at "who's Des Linden"
“Those are mine” me as HELL😂😂😂
Well done cody!
Cody Trians 🚂 best content thus far.   NYC baby!  You are a King 👑 Cody, Congratulations!  (Yes you are famous) Kelsey you look beautiful 🤗
how do you apply for this marathon without breaking the entry times? surely not everybody there got past those times?
So proud of this Peeves guy! Congratulations 🎉
love getting saw x (2023)
8:58 looks like a dream
YEAH CODY YOU DID IT
new york / new england  roads could be much harder than the california roads?? composition wise
Everyone yelling “coooodyyyyy“ gives me chicken joe in the forest during that penguin surfer movie
That 1 mile walk at the end was kind of annoying but expected.
How the helllllll did you charge it up queensboro??
I swear cody and stephanie soo are the only people that can make fucking slurpy mouth noises in their videos and I won't immediately exit out 😂
My aunt was there - she does it every year
We ascend together! Plotting on a 60k,. Kinda a big jump as my first and only race was a 10k... but gotta start somewhere?? lol. Anyways, thank you for being you.
I saw you when you were running at mile 25!!
Literally refused to watch Jeff’s video til this came out
go off cody!! i was proudly holding my “tiny meat, fast feet” sign
You poop once an hour? Is that good or bad? I do a morning poop and a maybe afternoon poop. How are you pooping so much?
Just a bunch of cumming … I mean running
chili insisting on giving kisses when cody's trying to talk to the camera will never not be adorable and hilarious to me
congrats !! this seems like a really fun race to run especially if you're not super stressed about the time and just want the experience!
I impolitely poked you at the expo and you looked spooked. Apologies brotha , but was great meeting you. Hope race day was great
Any chance your doing the Ironman in the valley?
next race: the boston marathon?? 👀
Here's how to help with your shin splints: Tibialis Raises - strength training for the muscle in the front of your shin
CHILLLI plz i love him sm
been waiting all week for this vid to drop. congrats cody!! sub 4 hours is insane. currently training for the austin tx marathon next year and these training vids are so motivating. choo choo!
You should come do the Calgary marathon in 2024!
I was tracking you!! But my friend had a later start time so I couldn’t see you but I was cheering from a few miles behind. Congrats on finishing and powering thru !!
CHOO CHOO
i'm about to run in my first half marathon on saturday. i signed up in august bc of this channel and your journey. before training, the longest i had run was 4 miles, but i hit an 11 mile run just last week. i'm super proud of everything i've done in this training, and i could never have found the motivation to start without you. you've shown a realistic attitude towards exercise while simultaneously doing incredible things. choo choo!!
Omg i also get that numbness!!! It freaked me out and i do not enjoy it haha
Crying real tears
omg i hope you do the one in sac i would love to come out and support you!! i commented on one of your videos a month or so bad when i was in a really bad place. im still not in the best spot mentally but watching your videos really inspired me to finally get up and work out! i realized that working out isnt about getting skinny (ive struggled with and ED most of my life) and ive been working out to gain muscle rather and its been going so well i feel so much better. mentally im still heavily struggling but im not giving up. thanks for sharing your journey and inspiring so many of us. cant wait to see you in the next marathon!
Need a new watch for sports no budget what do I get?
Running the Philly half marathon this weekend and my training plan completely fell off this past month and have been feeling super discouraged but feeling much more excited after this. Not going to focus on my time and just enjoy the experience!
You should do the Boston Marathon!!
Started running because of Cody for some cross training and did my first 10k not to long ago and did a 57:33time with a average pace of 5:45. Gunna keep running choooo chooo 🔥🔥
we need a pec greasing video asap cody
How'd the greased up peps fare?
Whats your stretching routine? Im trying to get into running but am horrible about stretching :/
Why did you decide not to run the week of the race?
Good stuff Cody! With all that salt residue on your shirt looks like your a pretty salty sweater, there’s a chance you’re not taking in enough salt/electrolytes
do chicago!! its so flat easy PR
Congratulations Cody.  Hope you enjoyed NYC
You're great! Maybe you could do an IROMAN someday...
I’ve run a few marathons and a few ultras. I used to get those random pains after tapering. Idk if this will help you at all, but I actually started to give myself a longer taper and it helped a ton!
To preface, the only sport I love and know all the major athletes names are for Track &Field/road running. So seeing you be sponsored by Brooks and them mentioning one of their pro athletes in your goodie bag is hilarious. Des has a podcast! 👀 it would be cool to see you on one cause anyone who runs can relate to each other. Or Josh Kerr, your other fellow brooks athlete, has a podcast with an another pro athlete called Sit and Kick.  Anyways, good job and thanks for recording your journey because it motivates others! ❤️
Funny story: Just did my first half marathon yesterday after being inspired from Cody, and it was fucking awesome. Huge life change. BUT the afternoon before the race, I walked out of a bar in Venice beach area straight into the face of Cody and Kelsey and got to talk to him for a few minutes, and tell him about the race I was doing the next day because of him. Was so wild after being a fan for years, and he was damn pleasant. Nice meeting you dude!
why did this video make me feel like I should run a marathon
Cody you are so inspiring and i look forward to watching every single one of your videos!!! Youre genuinely so slay and a fucking beast !!! Youre killing it!!!! Choo choo!!!!!
Did my first 5k end of October and signed up for 2 more 5ks in November CHOO CHOOO
Whoa des linden 🥺 she’s a beast is what she is
LETS FUCKING GO CORDDDYYYY!!! also i cannot stop listening to not going home it’s so fucking good
so proud of you kody! choo choo!!!
The pre race dinner 😂 😂
Come do the Chicago marathon!!!
you did amazing cody!! so proud of you 🫶
When he touched his nips and IMMEDIATELY looked up at kels omg im crying😭😭
The crispy salmon sushi is next level - your mustache server
Just did my first triathlon on Saturday and it was a half iron man! I’m in medical school, so it’s really hard to find time to work out consistently, but this channel was a big encouragement to me to keep going! I ended up doing really well and feeling great. Looking for my next race already, thank you Cody!
You should do the Chicago Marathon. Same vibes with everyone cheering, the energy is electric. And it's flat, so you can hit a PR there
Who is Des Linden???? lol Cody being so oblivious to american running legends is funny but disappointing
I can’t get over how much I love seeing Kelsey and Cody just being a very loving and sweet couple
This guy looks like he burns
Bro weird af
I’m sorry but you poop once an hour?? Wtf dude💀
you should run the boston marathon!!! the energy is always unreal
Des Linden one of the fastest long distance runner ever
Could live without those mouth noises while you were eating. Disgusting.
Averaging 8.05 like mph? That's a sprint for me wtf or 8 minute mile. Either way, that's a lighter sprint for me wtf.
LETS GO love these videos so much please keep them up
I’ve ran cross country my whole life and I’ve finally decided to sign up for my first half marathon! Next October! Looking forward to it! A full will be my goal for 2025!
So proud of you! GOER CORDY🗣️
this is awesome dude 🧊
Broooo 6:37 bruv got white glaze on lips with object outta frame........ pre race din din
Cody would absolutely be sick if you did the Mississauga Marathon in Ontario Canada
cody eating pasta is my new fav thing
fuck it u finally motivated me i'm gonna start running tmw morning even tho i hate running congrats cody!! also loved ur guest appearance on the basement yard!
Thank God I made my sawmon Monday before watching this! Congrats Chode!
Congrats Cody!! I’ve always struggled with pace for my entire running journey and have never been able to run sub-10s and my average has always been around 11 but no matter how much I run it stays above 10 and I enjoy it most when I run slow but it makes me feel weak when everyone easily runs sub-10 and I’ve never really been out of shape. How do I deal with this?
I was hoping for a call out in this video at Jeff for Cody beating Jeff's time by like 8 minutes after all that shit Jeff was talking about beating Cody's time. Ha
JEFFFFFFFF!!!!!! 😀🫶😀😃😄🫶💯
Let’s goooo peeves
Sponsor Boy 🫵🏽 hahaha
Been waiting for this video
Look at Peeves man so inspirational
Chili is actually the cutest omg
Chicago Marathon is a pretty flat course! People tend to run the Chicago marathon to qualify for other races
I’m so hard after this Omg
GAUR CAURDY!!!!!🚂🚂
That same thing happened with my foot during a race, stump from mile 6-10. Never could figure out the cause but would happen at similar distance during training too
Love you! The chewing ruined the whole video!
when i watch these i always debate becoming a runner, but then i remember the fact that i practically pass out after a mild jog for a half mile. maybe i'll stick to weight lifting
Des Linden is an Olympian and won the Boston Marathon in 2018. Long time Brooks athlete and hardcore whiskey lover
so inspiring, huge congrats to you. Its so awesome to see you knock down accomplishments
Proud of ya dude! Imagine in a handful of years, kels with the cowbells cheering you and baby boy on while y’all jog in the park 🥲
The highlight from Jeff’s vid was Jeff telling evil cody what to say😂😂 sponsored boy
The problem with the ny marathon is that initial wait time. When I did my marathon I was able to time my breakfast perfectly so that the energy from it would kick in exactly at around the 30 km mark so I never hit the wall. The fact you need to wait so long doesn’t allow you to have that timing
Cody you were my inspiration to run my first half marathon this past weekend! i barely trained because life got in the way, but i completed the run in a little over 2 hours. Im hella sore but so glad i got back on the racing train, and congrats to both of us fr 🎉 choo choo!
Video idea: take an edible and see how many miles you can do
#jefffm❤❤
I feel like I’m just FaceTiming with Cody and Kelsie on their couch
chicago marathon may be a good flat marathon with also tons of energy!!!
Beating your mortal enemy, Jeff Wittek not a bad day lol
Cody saying "who's Des Linden" had my jaw dropped. go look up one of the greatest runners ever fool. congratulations though! what an amazing accomplishment, truly a big fan of the channel! :)
Started training after your ultra marathon video and now I’ve got my first half marathon in a couple months 🎉🎉 choo choo🚂
love you Peeves!!
Cody that sounds like you could have compartments syndrome with the shin splint then numb leg, I have that to it’s very weird and I have no idea the solution but I know exactly the feeling your describing
"So 3 hours, that's 3 poops for me"
We’re proud of you, Cody! Choochoo!
tell Kelsey we love her and she looks amazing!!!
"Cody eats"
Seeing Cody not freak out about what he's eating the day before the Marathon is so wild to me lol. When watching I related to all of Kelsey's reactions about what he ate/drank.  I was following a strict bland ass diet the day before my marathon. Oatmeal with fruit for breakfast, then a turkey sandwich for lunch and 3 baked potatoes with no toppings or butter for dinner. But I guess  the lack of anxiety comes with experience.
bro DES LINDEN??? come on
Why is there so much running content in these mukbang videos?
damn proud of cody but I thought he was gonna hit sub 3:30
I love how Kelsey calls us choochees 😂
congrats cody!!! u did AMAZING! CHOO CHOO!!🚂🚂🚂🚂
Boston marathon next!! people go hard for Marathon Monday
I personally won’t run the NYC marathon until I qualify
Ran the sf half marathon CHOO CHOO
Big bro Cody, please eat a huge pasta before your next marathon! Get all that glycogen into your system then you can have as many coffees as you want on race day to relieve yourself of the excess weight to feel aerodynamic. Congrats on the run, looked super fun!
Running my first half this Saturday, I ran 10 miles in 1:28 last saturday which was my longest pre race run. Any tips on what I should do until Saturday? I'm feeling a bit sore so dont wanna run anymore and wanna hopefully get inside 2 hours :)
FYI child birth is the equivalent of running 4-6 marathons !
congratulations cody! running my first half this april. thanks for the inspo
You really are Polish.
oh my goddd that joe’s pizza made me so jealous
great job peeves!!
Congrats!!!!!!
Congrats Cody 🎉❤
watched this video and then immediately signed up for my cities thanksgiving half marathon cuz why not
My girlfriend and I did our first half marathon in San Francisco on the same day, we were choo-chooing the whole way through it! 🚂
never expeted to see my high school cross country coach in the background of a cody trains video. small world. go cody and coach gabby!
I listened to this while training for a 5k. Although that seems small, I grew up as an athlete but my early 20s I had kidney issues and couldn’t properly strength train or keep up with my endurance. I ran 1.7 miles today without stopping. Your video helped me along the way!
i want to do this marathon one day now!!!
Who’s Des Linden?!😂 noooo
I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL WEEK FOR THIS
This Sunday is my first full Ironman... All that is in my mind is ringing that First Timer bell at the finish line and every possible Cody Trains motivational scene! This video is yet another moment that'll sit in my mind! Thank yar Cardy!
Did my first half marathon in October thanks for the inspo Coaurdy
🐐
I ran my first 5K this past week with a time of 43 min! Super proud of that and thank you for the motivation!! Chooo chooo
I haven’t met anyone else with the numbness problem! It drives me crazy!
I hope you do the marathon in Sacramento. I’ll be out there cheering 👍🏽
Proud of you!!!
Currently in my off season for roller derby and watching you and so many others doing the new york and chicago marathons made me miss racing! so signing up for a quick holiday half marathon before derby season starts back up. choo choo!
Congrats Cody! I ran my first-ever half-marathon race on the same day!  I started training after I saw your ultra-marathon video and could barely run a mile. I hit my goals and ran the whole thing. Thank you for inspiring me !!
hahaha short
I can't imagine running a mile with a shin splint let alone 7! Cody is a beast 😩
I’m a little bit upset I have been watching you for a couple years and I am just finding out your last name isn’t Ko! ? I thought that was why Kelsey was marring you so she could be Kelsey Ko. ❤😂
I saw a tik tok of someone who approached him during the race- probably after the wall- and she said “how do you feel cody?!” and he said “bad”  congrats on finishing the race!!
I met so many other people out there cheering for you as well! Congrats on NYC! Also tons of people have to walk at some point. Casey Neistat was walking when I saw him last year if that makes you feel better
Same thing happened to me on my first marathon. Went through half at a 1:27 and finished with a 3:17. Last 4 miles were just pure survival
not knowing des linden HURT
I'm so proud of you Cody! CHOO CHOO
I would 100% come out and support if you ran for the CIM in Sacramento
Yo Cody you've got me looking into local races and I've never ran endurance before, last time I even sprinted was in elementary school so thanks for the inspo and for keeping it real instead of acting like discipline is easy or fun all the time
Choo Choo. I'm 33 years old, wife and I had our first child last August. At the time I weighed close to 310 pounds. I had played college sports and stayed fit in my 20s but life had caught up to me, and I was in a bit of a tail spin that was compounded with new parent insecurities. Amidst the humor and levity, this channel has been refreshingly transparent about the realities of life. Relationships to people, alcohol, work, family. Finding purpose and showing up for yourself, all resonated so deeply with me (and clearly many others). I'm down over sixty pounds this year, consistently running 10 miles per week or more, and am scheduled to do a half marathon in the Spring. Congrats on the growing family, choo choo.
Cool it with the Des Linden Slander
doing more plyos & calf exercises made my shin splints disappear
i watch these videos for kelsey and i'm done pretending i dont
Great work Cody! Now you can start training for the real races, the ultramarathon circuit. Unlike what you’ve been doing in the city, these races take place out in the mountainous backcountry over 30-300 miles. I hope you’re ready for the real deal. If so, I’ll see you at the starting line
w cods
I thought I was the only one who had numb feet sometimes! It’s horrible and feels like you’re running on a stump.
Woo!
"Pardonnez moi.."😂
Great job Cody!!! If you come to Sac I will definitely be there cheering you on… if not running it myself!!! Choo choooo!!!!!
Great job Cody! I’ve been trying to get more into fitness since you started Cody trains but always find it hard because i have a 15 month old daughter I stay home with while working from home. I started swimming over the summer and doing more weight lifting but after the NYC marathon , I felt like everyone I knew was at it (I live 2 hours away) I really wanted to be part of the action next time. So I ran 3 days last week totaling 7 miles for the week which is a big deal for me because I haven’t run in years. Thanks for being an inspiration! It’s hard to have time to do things for yourself once you have kids and I fall victim to not prioritizing myself but always seeing how motivated you are helps me be more motivated. Thanks for all you do for the Cody trains community!
cant even run 2 blocks without dying a little.
Whatever happened to the LA to SD run?
Please do a full day of eating

Hi Cody, this past Sunday I completed my first marathon. It was the outer banks marathon, I absolutely love this channel and it gives you so much motivation, I watched it right before the race. I hit the wall around mile 19 after running across a 2 mile bridge with 20mph head winds in my face and pouring rain. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. Love you cody❤
Congrats, Cody!!! This channel has gotten me out of a running funk and back into running, for 2024 I plan on signing up for a 5k, 2 10ks around my area, a half mari next sept and (maybe??) a full in november. in that order lol. we'll see!!!!! Keep chugging along, choo-choo!!!!!
So awesome!!! Congratulations!!:))) so proud of you! CHOO CHOO
Came for Cody, always stay for Kelsey!!!! Our king and queen!
Ran and got a PR of 3:56! Was out there looking for ya Cody. So proud of you, NYC is so tough, we all hit that wall!
My man you are my favourite racist
shin splints are maybe because heel striking is not good for you. some people can do it, some can't. try experimenting with forefoot or midfoot landing, shorter steps and higher cadence. should maybe help. congrats on finishing nonetheless ps: i started training quite seriously in september, partly because of this channel and average robs. did a 30 day running challange of minimum 5k per day, and all the way up to half marathon two times.  I raced my first race saturday, 10km in 42 minutes. hope to get faster and better and looking forward to see you do the same <3
Correct thumbnail
AHHHHHH kelsey's bump is so cute
saw your IG story when you finished and I cried???? I was so invested in this journey. SO happy for you! <3 🚂💨🚂💨
Come run Chicago next year!
absolute slay cody!! you are an inspiration to me- i’m running my first half marathon (in nyc) in december and i decided to do that because watching your various journeys on this channel has been so moving. i was one of the spectators at the nyc marathon, manifesting that someday that’ll be me (november 2025 maybe?) so thank you for documenting all of this, much love, choo choo <3
not “who’s des linden?” cmonnnnn
Honestly not knowing who Des Linden is was cringe.
congrats to the number 1 most tracked athlete of the marathon
choo choo
Beautiful nippples princess
Choo choo! I ran my second Chicago Marathon in October and my right foot also went numb - worst feeling EVER. Way to go sub-4! This channel is motivating me to try and go sub-4 in Berlin next year, thanks for the inspiration.
Congratulations! Watching this video just made me want to train more!
My foot goes numb sometimes but I just loosens my shoes and it usually helps a TON
6:35 might be the most disturbing clip of you I've seen on this channel  But seriously, great job as always! 🚂 🚂
CODYYYYY! I saw you run by Central Park north, I think you heard me scream ‘we ascend together’ 😂 So proud of you, choo choo!
good job peeves
I couldn't be there but I ran a marathon alone in the woods in solidarity thanks for the motivation Cody!
finally!!
Went wrong when you decided to run the 6:40 mile
Kelsey is gonna be such a good mom 😭😭😭 oh yeah good job cody
YES cody! my favourite racist!!
I can't believe you said beanie ... we lost another one.
Congrats on the race! Strava by default shows moving time on the activity. Moving time doesnt include stops or moments of almost no moving. In edit mode, under type of run, select race. It'll show the elapsed time instead!
Congrats Cody!   Chili 😂
At the start of this year I couldn’t fathom running one mile and I just completed my first half marathon this past weekend. Thanks for the inspiration and Choo Choo!!!
This has easily become my favorite of Cody’s channels
This makes me want to get into running
So proud of you. What an incredible journey Cody 🤍🤘🏼
You should definitely listen to Des Linden's audio book, "Choosing to Run: A Memoir!" It's really good!
congrats again!! I'm so excited to see what you do next! I want to get back into running bc of you! Thank you Cody!
finally. ive been waiting to see this
You should really try scrapping your shins it helps a lot !!
I was waiting for this video 🔥🔥🔥
watching cody do someo of the hardest things you can put your body through while stuffing my face w almond joys
Finally
Need need need CHOO CHOO Merch
Congrats Cody!!! The same day I ran the run the rock 50 miler in 10:33:25 and was thinking of about you and our shared suffering. Great job, very proud!
Congrats
Congratulations!! Last year I ran a half marathon for the first time. I took a little break after my calves started hurting consistently. I'm getting back to it and watching the Cody trains channel does help having a fun attitude towards running since I don't run with others.
Why TF did Chelsea leave the house like that, lmfao wtfffff.
I can’t stop saying Gor Cordy
Been lifting for 11 months straight now and I feel so much better than I have in the last handful of years physically and mentally. I'm definitely not stopping any time soon!
I've said it once and ill say it again - drop the running music playlists!!!!
I run my first 10km in the Athens Authentic Marathon this Saturday, and did it in 56:43! I started training in late August (I could barely run 1km without losing it before that) and I couldnt be happier about my result! Cody keep doing what you're doing, this journey has shown me how great running and persistence can be!! CHOOCHOOOO
If your change your Strava run to a race it will use your total elapsed time which will be the 3:53. That 3:48 is only your moving time in case you either went to the bathroom or just stopped. But I also did the NYC marathon and that walk to leave the finish line was awful, I'm glad the weather was nice since it would've been so much worse if it was raining or cold
Honestly, I was worried this video wouldn't get posted after Jeff roasted Cody in his NYC marathon video. Very brave for sponsor boy to make this retort.
cody you gotta run the chicago marathon next year
Congrats Cody!
Dude, I kid you not, I have a similar story that took place at the 2023 LA Marathon with a similar time. Thanks for the continuous & consistent inspiration. Wish we could chat about it! Congrats bro!!
Congrats Cody! 🎉 such a great accomplishment! Keep going, choo choo! 🚂🚂🚂
Congratulations Cody!! 🎉
congrats cody!!!!!!
made the mistake of watching cody eat while i do. the sounds almost made me vom lol
LETS GOOORRR !! GOOD JOB CORDYYYY!! CHOOR CHOOOR
Where’s the crispy rice & salmon from?
Running on a numb foot truly is completely unnerving.  I HATE when that happens.  Way to pull through, CORDY.  CHOO CHOO!
I appreciate the vulnerability of leaving in “oh sorry I’m filming” I felt that for ya 😬
Just wanted to say the watching these videos made me decide to improve my two mile time for the Army's PT test, which was a 18:30, and after running a 13:31 on my most recent test, I realized that running is something I could progress with, as of last weekend I ran my first 10k train run at 50:33 and in 10 days I'm doing my first Half Marathon, with a full Marathon planned for February. The planning and daily training has brought my life together, and I'm seeing benefits in every aspect of my day to day, thanks for the inspiration
skipping all the eating scenes cuz I cant stand chewing noises
ok?
Do the Chicago marathon
Come do the Amsterdam marathon next year! Course is flat as hell and also hosted by TCS
Choo choo Cordy!!
I was so excited getting this notification, congrats Cody!!!!
Choo choo!!!!!!!! 🚂
love being a choochie!!!
i ran competitively in high school and i miss the act of racing! the highest i’ve done is a 10k. i would love to get back into it
Cody, I love you, but I feel as though you're throwing out all the effort you out in in with all that pizza and oil you eat.  Rewarding yourself is good, but we all know that fast-food just always makes you feel like garbage afterwards. Just a word of advice.   Anyways, congrats on the time, it's actually impressive considering when you started training for it. Don't be too harsh on yourself. choo choo.
today i learned cody's last name isn't actually ko 3:57
Congrats on the finish Caurdy!!!! I just signed up for my first half next year, we ascend together, CHOO CHOO
FINALLY, been waiting for this video for so long it feels like
OKC has a marathon lol. Flat and fast!
The interaction w the Uber driver was so good
Des approved snacks im so jealous ???
15:33 bro realized he wasn't built for this 💀💀  jk cody you did great!!
time to break your silence on palestine. i'm disgusted, but not shocked.
“Who’s Des Linden?” 😔
Oh nice some SAWKS
Just in time for lunch Cody. You’re awesome
Did my first half marathon in pittsburgh last May. Now I'm goin for the full marathon next May!
Just did my first on Saturday in 3:51:04 thanks for the motivation! 🚂 🚂
proud of you!!!!
ran my first 10k race at the end of october and hit a PR of 1hr 9min! if anyone told me even 6 months ago that i would be consistently running and training every week i wouldn’t have believed them. watching your channel helped me achieve this because you’re realistic about your schedule, and you’ve taught me how to prioritize consistency over perfection. CHOO CHOO!!
everytime i watch these videos i also get second hand nervousness as the race approaches
GAR CARDY 🎉
I’ve been WAITING for this video
🎉🎉 congrats
You inspired me to start my own fitness channel and too keep pushing myself in running
Getting bot spam comments on your 3rd channel is how you can know you've made it
