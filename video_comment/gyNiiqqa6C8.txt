Only better what I found is Tiger Shroff growing beard to look different from heroine
Bollywood now: Action ; telgu Story : tamil: songs : punjabi  Music : pop  Final words: Destruction
Meanwhile Jammy Pants on The Bengal Files : ABBA nahin manenge...... The only good thing about this video is that he didn't lick the posteriors of the makers like he usually does for his masters from YRF.......
5:13 you say blood splatter, I hear DEXTER❤
Seriously saying , nowadays indian flim makers and producers were having zero knowledge of making a violent flim , simply potraying characters like a butchers who cut chop meat in meat stalls,kills 100 of people even video game logics somehow better than this crap movie logics 🤬🤬🤬
Don't listen these so called critics #baaghi4 gonna be blockbuster
The audience should "Bhaago"
Truly inspired by 'Animal' and 'Marco' 😂. A CG on screen vomit... 🤮
sajid nadiagwala is just a waste ... what a waste of time and money doing with a waste director
Dear Jammy, If public wants to see Bloody Action then why u have any issue. Public Enjoyed & celebrated a lot Animal & Marco and You never know they love this as well. Stop thinking negativity
The trailer looks like a mutton shop video game
Just take a look at the comments of the trailer once, there are atlest 400-500 funny comments before someone likes the trailer or even the idea of the movie 😂😂😂😂
The only thing more pathetic than the storyline of Baaghi 4 is the acting. Or, I should say, the complete absence of it. Tiger Shroff is a disaster, and this trailer is proof that some things just don't get better with time.
A franchise baaghi started with south remake 😂 bollywood never learn
I don’t care if the movie is shitty which I know it is..I’m just here to support our queen Harnaaz
Funny thing is, sequences in Animal itself were shameless copies from multiple movies like John Wick and Man from Nowhere. Copy of a copy is cringe.
Animal movie but from Meesho😂
What 😲 Bhaagi 4 is coming, which south india movie remake this hindi movie 🤔?
Deep breaths brother 🤗
❤️❤️‍🔥Good way to say the truth 💪🏼Gj
Tiger shroff has decided to end his career
Purpose of every frame in Animal. It reminds me of a conspiracy theory by myself. In Park, fake Ranbir Kapoor will replace the original one. But Rashmika (or maybe the servants) will recognise the fake Ranbir because of the 1000 thread/inch underwear.
The characters look like blood thirsty hyenas in every frame. I was disgusted to watch the teaser. Looks like N&G production has become a money laundering hub, there's no other explanation for such shit to be produced in this dire state of bollywood
"When Baaghi 4 releases its posters, you become sceptical" .... Come on Jammy, I can show you your tweet appreciating the poster.
I want you to collaborate with BnFTv, pj explained etc. You all will vibe I think.
On one end we see the success of mahavatara nasimha which is what our younger gen should see and grow with, then there are extremely gore movies like animal, marco and now baaghi 4 which would only make younger gen go crazy. Imagine us millenials grew up in era where love stories would take center stage compared to this extremely gore content era which would indirectly result in rise of devil minds committing serious crimes.
why does the video look like a tiktok reel? the playback speed seems to fast
🔥🔥🔥🔥
You frustration was so evident even through screen.. wish the actors could emulate such emotions in movies as well..
Jammy been talking like Chatgpt even before chatgpt existed.
Bhagi is varsham(rain) telugu movie remake.. Prabhas reached KALKI but bollywood reached bhagi4..
poor sanjay dutt...feel bad for the shit he has to do...
baghi franchisee is a remake factory , right from the first part to the 3rd ones. after the pandamic when people exposed to the content across india, they starting rejecting the remake stuff
This movie seems to be a mockbuster and a parody combination
Bhai tu bhi wahi repetitive angreji jhadta hai😂
Thankyou for mentioning Animal Time to watch that teaser again.
Y r u ranting , producers money , director n actors reputation. What do you loose ? In any business u have 95% failures n less than 5% success , that’s just the way it is .. follow the herd mentality ! Stop whining ! The producer is a businessman and is doing what he wants with his money .. everyone isn’t a custodian of good cinema !
Matlab kuch bhi!
So it is like a remake of the original of the same language.
At this point i can't blame Tiger Shroff as whatever he will choose, A Fool Director came and ruined it always and the actor will always blamed because they are the faces not who that actually directed it .
Bollywood is filled with idiots, they think they made movie at the level of Nolan but in the end the product is 💩💩💩
Yar ye violence pe movies banana sahi mein jaroori hai kya? Theke tum bana rahe ho ATLEAST BE CREATIVE YAR wahi bakwas plot koi kidnapp ho jata hai aur fir wahi maar kaat. Kaise chu log hai yarr im so done with bollywoood. Marathi movie industry is 10 times better theyre ATLEAST putting out unique sotries.
thank god u called this shit show out.
The first line of this trailer is exactly a lesson for them its not necessary and not a necessity at all
Binod
Wow
0:33 He's Angry! Never seen before.
Like what Mr. Javed Akhtar said, everything is a copy from an original. But now they dont even want to work on making it seem different from the og. And the worst part is there are still people who will go to watch this regurgitated bs!
Originally Bhaagi was remake of Telugu movie varsham…. But varsham is single movie and bhaagi was on 4th instalment now…
I echo your sentiments and I didn’t even watch the full teaser. Those poor blood splashing vfx made my blood boil in anger. On a side note why do I feel you have something personal against Sajid. Any sour experience? Anyway I care less, he seems like a bully and full of himself who shows no respect at all to juniors and people outside his circle..
It will take one full year of directors like Neeraj Pandey, Tigmanshu Dhulia and actors like Pankaj, Kay Kay...to come out with back to back movies to save bollywood from sinking to the abyss
Now this will also ruin one episode of Kapil Sharma show promoting this piece of crap...
Everyone in the trailer 🧔‍♀️🔪💦🩸🧔‍♂️🔪💦🩸👧🔪💦🩸👩🔪💦🩸👩‍🦰🔪💦🩸👵🔪💦🩸.. wow, original and pakka blockbuster Rs500crore+ collections confirm 👶🔪💦🩸
It wasn't a review but a rant
Sanjay Raut in Politics = Sanjay Dutt in Cinema = everywhere
Honestly the franchise is dead and should stay dead
Maturity is when you realise Bollywood always follow only trends . Pathan aii sabko action movie spy thriller banani hai. Stree 2 aii sabko comedy horror banani hai Animal aii abko bloodshed dikhana hai. Ab saiyaara aii sabko love stories banani hai , par truth is Audience ko bas accha movie dekhni hai chahae subject koi b ho
Just money laundering at this point
Im tired of tigers backflips in every movie he does.
Just saw the trailer. Why does every fight scene look like gods swatting ants? Kill worked because you could feel the hero burning a lifetime of calories just to take down three guys. You see the strain, the blood, the “oh crap I might actually die” moments and that’s what makes it epic. Please bring more movies like Kill to the theaters. Now that's a great watch.
They know who this movie is for, the chunk that made money for that one movie. It's weird you generalise that chunk being smart or even caring enough. Like.. why?
I lost hope in Bollywood months ago. Now its just about watching one if and only if my close friends manage to sell it to me else its just me in the comfort of my house watching classics from the past that i missed, be it any language! And mind you, there are so many to be watched!
Only best part about it is b praak singing...what a voice he has
The trailer was so unintentionally and annoyingly  funny  ,and Sanjay dutt has become schezwan chutney of Bollywood he's used everywhere
Tiger ahould stop Acting and opt Choreography. Even Arjun Kapoor can act better than this guy.
Sajid Nadiadwaala never offered any good stuff earlier, and now he's offering us dumb and useless stuff. Housefull 5 and Baghi 4 are horrendous. I mean who would go to watch a sasti copy of Animal ?
And yet Baghi 4 will earn 400 crores and Baghi 5 will be approved.
Bhai ji, you're the same person who has a cheese and sugar fest chick flick like Kal Ho Na Ho as your favorite film! 🤣🤣
Trailer looks like a scene from Mutton shop
Introduction - stab! Stab! Stab ! Stab! Hero entry - stab! Stab! Stab ! Stab! Heroine entry - stab! Stab! Stab ! Stab! Story - stab! Stab! Stab ! Stab! Interval - stab! Stab! Stab ! Stab! Second half - stab! Stab! Stab ! Stab! Climax - stab! Stab! Stab ! Stab! Audience - stab! Stab! Stab ! Stab! Collection - stab! Stab! Stab ! Stab!
Till Bhaghi 3 - Telugu movies remakes , does tiger has brain or just body
- Bhagi 4 - maalik ( Rajkumar Rao ) - dhurandar   It's all the copycats without any orginal ideas after animal, marco and Kll ,   Bollywood is finished
Hello Jammy bhai,   The director of the movie is A Harsha from KFI, idiot is now ruining both time and money for Bollywood. The Kannada film industry had already named him as Rod Rambola 😅
The fact that people like Tiger Shroff get to keep starring in these same old bottom of the barrel sh!t movies and the audience keep coming back to watch those is a testament to how low the bar is for the majority of the Indian audience as far as the quality of cinema is concerned.
Problem with tiger he is too kind to producers he should be more cutthroat and choose proper script and directors
First 40 seconds and I already see the frustration and irritation in his eyesss guysss😂
I'm happy that mollywood industry tried Marco and it was sensational. And it's never gonna happen again in malayalam cinema probably.
I am not wrong when i say this is the most genuine page on youtube among all the other reviewers
2:01 Not gonna lie but axe wala scene animal se bhi pehle kai sare movies me already aa rakha hai if you are calling baghi a copy then call animal also a copy. Baaghi 4 me action and brutality animal and Marco se zyada hogi likh ke lelo
Bhaghi 🤧 , Audience Theatre Chod kar Bha gi  🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻💨
Just because of that female lifting man scene, extremely unrealistic, I will NEVER watch this movie. Its a tra** movie No men should watch it
This is sooo bad that is is goood 😂😂 will guarantee it will bring a new revolution in meme world 😂😂
Yeh movie hai ya mutton shop?
I remember when Baaghi 1 was released. Me and my cousin were kids very excited for Tiger and went with our parents and our parents hated the movie 😂😂
True That!... please breathe while talking.. really high ROS
This genre of gore and ultra violence is actually annoying. We had enough , now let them focus on real fight scenes with proper hand to hand combat ,using MMA and other martial arts. And enough of slow motion fights. Now a days each and every fight scene is slow motion.
I thought Marco was a piece of shit. Imagine what I feel watching this masterpiece of a trailer.
Now vidyut has jost gone from bollywood to hollywood 😂😂 so now what will tiger do
Relax, who cares. It's just a movie.
Typecasting of HERO and VILLIAN in the action genre and in one movie
Can you please do a review on '35 chinna katha kaadu' a telugu movie?
Funny thing is we werent able to guess which South Indian film's remake it was
I really don't know how you were able to even analyze this hyper-stimulated version of blood vomit.
0:05 agar video nahi banaoge to apna youtube ka dhandha kaise chalaoge? matlab kuchbhi? bakwas mat kiya karo, mudde pe ao humesha.
Sajib ne banaya hain what you expect..bohot barka flop hoga..inlogo ko violence bhi dikhana nahi ata, tiger ka career sajid le duba hain already
It all started with ROLEX from VIKRAM who started this bloodbath thing with a butcher knife in hand  and since then you can see it everywhere
Villain  role exists, Sanjay Dutt be life permanent hoon sir
Matlab Kuchh bhi! Last time i saw something like this it was called Hello Brother!! lol
Your frustation is shining 😂
Sanjay Dutt is the new Indian Pedro Pascal
I was expecting to hear a “bhenchod” from jammy at the end when he was staring at the camera 😅
bro chill, they're trying to evade Taxes!! They make such movies to declare bankruptcy and get the monies
At this point youtube should reduce the time of monetization threshold of around 8 mins, youtubers creating at least 8 mins video for monetization on topics that might not need that much time.  Can't blame them though
If animal can be a hit, then this movie looks better.  Sanjay Dutt as villian is not a joke. So keep hating unnecessarily but this movie will do good.
Bollywood is joke for many years just getting bigger and bigger.
I totally understand where you going with this film been lauded by the kids... my daughter was too fond of Baaghi but eventually gave up on the superstar
Sanju baba and Sallu bai, both are working just for the heck of it...
They want to recreat Animal movie
I think its remake of directors previously film directed by himself
Bagghi 4 is basically Animal, KGF and Marco if they were dumb. I don't know why Included Animal here. That movie is also dumb as hell
It's still time the makers should promote it as a spoof of action films made recently.
Wow so much gussa 😂
I do believe that such movies are involved in money laundering. Otherwise I see no reason for these kind of movies to exist.
Back in 2016 , I genuienly enjoyed Baaghi movie.  I felt happy that finaly we got a movie that is properly  based on Tiger Shroof's potential in action and martial arts. I though just like hollywood celebrated arnold schwarzenegger and sylvester stallone for their muscles and action scenes,  We will get chance to celebrate Tiger just like that.   But they dissapointed me so much.
Tiger to Jammy - "Sabko aati nhi meri jaati nhi"
Clearly a copy of Malayalam movie Marco, the action sequences I mean!
Baaghi 4 ❌ fruit ninja ✅
The last time I judged a movie that it will be a super flop was flying jaat. Thank you tiger.. you make things easy fr us.
Don't forget the CGI tears in this trailer jammy🥲
😂😂😂😂😂 !!! Trying to be another KILL or the Malayalam movie MARCO. Imagine the plight of the viewers in theatre, watching this mayhem 🙏
Who else felt like this was script read out from ChatGPT, or may be the way he talks monotonously?
Bhai english mein bhadka🤣
Silverlining of this "film" isn't any,will be if it gets delayed to release in any platform for atleast 65 years.
I’ve been saying this for 10yrs that tiger is a gymnast and he should go into Indian gymnastics and he definitely can win bronze for sure for India if not silver or gold. But as usual he’s son of a multi millionaire actor so he keeps on getting millions to repeat same things for 10yrs.
I don't think tiger shroff has a disconnect in what he should do. He's just that guy that is given a huge platform to showcase martial arts and dancing. I just don't see the need for all that he shows on instagram and youtube translated into full fledged movies with big budgets.
To me the trailer looked like made by the present ram gopal verma
It's sad to see our beloved Jammy this frustrated and disappointed with the state of bollywood that is in... Hope the next your brings more peaiseworthy movies than this year
Thankyou Jammy for keeping spine strong
Tamilians, Kannads are banning Hindi in their states. They show hatred for Hindi language but we Hindi audience are choosing a Tamil film over Hindi film. Shame on us.  We failed Hrithik as an actor. His good movies like Vikram Vedha became a flop. A time will come he will stop making movies. Its time we show our love for Hrithik. Lets make War 2 a blockbuster.
Vanga's "Animal Park" script got stolen ???
Marco was such a shitty movie (no objection to bloodshed) because it had nothing on the story front. Just a continuous saga of revenge with no brains and logic. Looks like Baaghi 4 is repeating the same template.
They thought putting bloodsed will help to overshadow tigers bad acting skills .
Waiting for Ganpath to be released on OTT.
Told you ... Bollywood in the long run will mark the Ranbir Kapoor's Animal as a benchmark and will be named Bollywood-before-Animal and Bollywood-after-Animal... The effects are already visible with some inspirations in Ranveer Singh's upcoming movie Dhurandhar and now almost copy in Tiger Shroff's next Baaghi 4.
You mic is real Porn Star of this video 😂
Dude...have you blasted KGF, Pushpa,Animal ,RRR belongs to chapri action movies...No  Then shut your mouth
Critics: The Indian audience have had enough of extremely violent movies. Sajid: "Justbecauseitsoverdoesntmeanitsreallyoverandi flthinkitsovermaybeyou'llbecomingoveragainandl 'Ilhavetogetoveryoualloveragain"
Bollywood’s RADIO SILENCE on Mahavtar Narsimha will not be forgotten!
Success, and bagi, are those movies
now this was a rant.
this wasn't a normal Jammy Review...This was a Full on RANT... and i Agree with everything he just said
I watched the teaser and my first thought was this is so wanna be animal. The bloodshed just looks unnecessary because we know there isn’t going to be any story. Just like dhurandhar’s trailer seemed like a non Smoking ad this just looked like a blood bath ad (something along that lines) more than a movie.
Another Black money to white conversion scheme ...100-150 Cr toh yeh log tomato ketchup ka expense daaal denge
Bro I didn't see Baaghi 1 2 & 3, & now there's Baaghi 4 already? I feel guilty did I miss something? 😢
All I have to say is... Use Tiger Shroff for good stuff. He is getting wasted.   Y'all didn't use Vidyut & finally he made it by his own productions, except those even though he can act well , don't get much chances for other productions. Tiger is given those. Yet, all his movies are remakes of South movies or illogical. What a waste...💔 Use his dance & action & looks damn it 🤷🏻‍♂️
Opening shot of Tiger lying down on rooftop is Deadpool 2, and bride kebabing a man is Deadpool. And I saw earlier a post saying Baaghi 4 going to be Ghajni on steroids. If it is so, oh god help us from the doom.
Sandeep Reddy Manga: I'm the most shitty director  A Harsha: Hold my shit
Who the hell is die hard fan of Tiger shroff here...!!???
No need to make such review, ye movie 100-150 crore asaani se oma legi😂😂😂 Janta hi chutiya h is desh ki
One scene looks like bangladeshi borbad movie’s scene. That was also a pathetic movie
Bro loved the raw, honest energy of this rant!!! Much warranted for this situation!!❤
Bollywood capitalize only at the name of franchise, and it's absurd when the story is nowhere connected, either you take totally different actors or continue the story.
when we see jackie chan movies, how much hard work is done in the stunt choreography
They should have added in the last " inspired by adipurush"
Tiger Shroff should do action movies like Who Am I (Jackie Chan Movie). What is this sh*t movie, only killing and blood, do they feel like there is no value of a human life? They are just mindlessly killing people.
Bollywood standards in action movie dad by day 📉
We need Tiger in War2 Tiger has only one good movie i.e War
This teaser was worse than a Spoof , it was literally embarrassing
When Jammy launches his podcast, it promises to be a captivating journey—an unfiltered voice of the common man engaging in profound, incisive conversations with cinema’s most critical stakeholders. A rare confluence of authenticity and intellect, destined to redefine how we experience the art of film.
this felt like when your overworked elder sibling finally crashes out. (reasonable crash out tho). i didnt even watch the tralier, i am just going to trust him.
I think and hope this movie turns out to be a parody like Badass Ravikumar. If that's not the case, then it's sorry state of affairs.
Courageous video❤❤❤❤
Shutup and stop making a video. Watch it or don't
Karunesh talwar once said about bollywood brainrot "bollywood se mera bharosa uth chuka he, sab uncle log ke haath me hai"🥲
gaps between those doors and that TV 😬😵‍💫
Once a 💩..always a 💩... bhikariwood for a reason 🤬💩💩💩
Marco ko kyun nahi bola animal jaisi saale kyonki woh south film hai double standard aadmi
Nalla hater 😂
There was considerable hype surrounding this film, with many claiming it would be a completely different experience compared to the other prequels in the franchise. Personally, I had been eagerly anticipating the trailer for days. However, when I finally watched it, I was so unsettled by what I saw that I closed the video just 16 seconds in. It feels as though the makers are attempting to distance themselves from accountability for this mass-violence crime drama, despite the disturbing content it appears to portray.
I liked Baaghi 2 ❤😊
People blaming bollywood, I'm with you. However the director is Harsha, who's a kannada director who is known for copy pasting in sandalwood industry.
Absolutely on point ..love your confidence calling a spade a spade.
Whenever i saw this kind of shit from hindi cinema then instantly I recall one of the statement from Anurag Kashyap and Tigmanshu Dhulia :- Actors se kaho Acting Workshop aur Classes pe jao to wo Gym chale jate hai...
Who da hell thought Hiring the guy who made Bhimaa was a good idea. The entire concept of that movie is matlab kuch bhi!!! If money laundering was their goal then why don't they do it by making some good movies!!
Us bro..the same uncomfortable and nauseas feeling of venting out after watching the teaser.Haash,its like what and why did we just saw it..
Movie realase hone mia time hai negativity mat pehalawo
I feel questionable now on being one of the admirers of Tiger Shroff.This movie just stands unacceptable to me I don't know why,absolutely uncomfortable to watch the teaser itself(and no it is not because of the gruesome bloodshed)it's just a frivolous mockery of a genre to appear in a race and thinking to win it as well.
Jammy be like : Choti Animal ho kya !!?
Feel bad for Sanjay Dutt 😢
Bhai tu agar video nahi banata toh andar hi andar ghut ta rehta. Accha kiya video banakar bhadas nikaal di.
Movie name should be THE KASAI..😂
Bro don't hope  about Tiger and also tell like he is some legend that kids don't know
Teko shan parasar se sikhna chahiye review karna, tere se pachas guna accha review deta hai wo, tu to tatti movie ko bhi accha bata deta hai
The end scene of Sanjay Dutt k!ll!ng someone, it doesn't seem like he is k!ll!ng someone but feels like he is cutting vegetables, if you see it, i guess you could agree
In A Harsha's defense, he has made pretty good commercial movies in Bheema, Vedha and Bhajarangi in Kannada
Yeh kya action hain yaar ...sab ke sab kasaai ban gaye hain....kitna khoon kharaabaa🥷🏻.....Missing the dhishum dhishum waala fight in these days 😢 the only film that I loved from the Baaghi series was the first one.....still love watching it ....
I've never seen him this angry ever since we 'accidently' confused him to Mithun's son.
Bakkk ज्यादा English बोल रहे हो😂 Hindi से बात कर ना😂
btw guys anmol is not sucidal
Bro becomes the roaster 😂😂
You look visibly disappointed bro .....i can understand . And sanjay dutt agreed to work because of his friendship with jackie shroff ....
i bet that when vanga come out with spirit everyone will copy that
I really don't get the point of producers obsessively making sequels for this dead franchise.
2:20 This is happening everywhere. Those boomers or old folks who grown up watching mass masala commercial movies don't like fresh concepts. It's true that they want reference point or films because they lack creativity & imagination. They can't Imagine a thing & want successful formulas because they can't afford or accept failures with new concepts.  They love cringe concepts & old ideas. Many people laugh at cringe jokes & recruit people who write cringe content.   Moreover some cringe films are getting box office collections & success in B & C centers, now they have reference point / success formula to produce more cringe movies.
Wasn't sure if Baaghi 4 was a comedy/parody or a bad Kill/Marco clone.
The last time I genuinely enjoyed watching Sanjay Dutt in a movie was in Toolsidas Junior, and that was 5 years ago. Since then, he has been playing these repetitive roles, and I am very tired of it. It's like he doesn't care about the craft but rather about money, which is why he looks like he has been sleepwalking in every movie he has been in for the past few years.  Also, I laughed so hard whilst watching the teaser because the makers believe that they are making something slick when, in reality, it looks like a cheap imitation of Animal and has poor logic. I mean, a drill goes into Tiger Shroff's head, and he isn't looking like he is in pain or dying. I mean, WTF!!! Do these makers believe we will genuinely like this because if so they are stupid.
Petition for Tiger to keep all his clothes on, till the end of the movie he does next... :D
Baaghi 2 Budget: 59 Cr. Earned: 254 Cr. Baaghi 3 Budget: 80 Cr. Earned: 137 Cr.  We can rant about how crass this franchisee is, but the reality is they're making sh*tload of money. Why wouldn't they make the sequels?
Bro is soo Desperated that he forgot to mention sourabh sachdeva 😅
Animal ka spoof bna diya 😂😅.. aur wo kya tha jo wo harnaaz bnde ko utha kar aise fainkti hai jaise koi mistri aatte ke bore ko fainkta hai 😂😅
They have camera , budget , actors but not stories and they don't believe in storyteller.
If we are to remove the bloodshed & gore that was shown and disrespect towards women in Animal, which can and should never be approved, Animal was still a brilliant movie in terms of how it was made. And if you are so engrossed in a movie that you don’t even care whats the name of lead actor till the interval, that I think was the hall mark of great  writing, editing and direction.   Animal had its loopholes and stupidity but still was a very well made movie.
South director masterpiece😂
Kya ghatiya trailer hai aur kya hi ghatiya imitation bhi hai.  This is what they want to show to the youth and mass market.   I am amazed how this movie will be approved by CBFC while I heard a passionate scene (maybe too passionate to show on screen for public) was removed from War 2 😂😅
It felt like a parody of Animal . If i did not know the actors , i would have thought that it is a parody made by tanmay bhat.
whhat can you expect from a third class kannada director 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Even they hired same singer for same type of song while fighting like animal movie
Tamatar saste hue shayd.  Sab tamatar kaat rhe hai Jise dekho.
I am really questioning Tiger's Choice of films, is he not getting films? or is he being forced to do such films? Tiger, blink twice if you are in trouble
Sanjay Dutt who could barely stand is main villain 😂 even fast action cuts and slo mo won't save this cringe fest.
If audience can love Saiyyaara and Animal then you can see where the standards are for Hindi Cinema. The bar is so low so low that average movies like this are getting the benchmark the level to which others are compared I mean its ridiculous
Sanjay Dutt seems to be working like he has more debt on his head than Nicholas Cage does   Not that I am jealous he should get his bag 💰💰
Tiger shroff is a weak actor, let's accept this fact. Other than dancing which most can do these days, there is hardly any redeeming featire in his reportoire. Bad acting chops, zero voice modulation, screen presence of a background actor and expressions of a constipated kid. He is glorified Vidhyut Jamwal but with Nepo legacy.
There's only one way to let them know what we think about them. Dont go to theatre, don't watch this film and make it a Flop!
A Harsha film director of this film from Kannada has the same charm as Martin Director arjun. 😅
I liked the trailer
Worst Trailer. It is not an Indian movie. forget it now.
At this point, Munna Michael looks more better
Anmol was true to his word this was an absolute rant 🤣😂
Tiger Shroff will retire after this movie.... SuperFlop hone wala hai
They won't change, you should stop doing analysis for any tiger's movie
Pagal hai kya be yeh dekho aa gaya tiger Shroff hater pehle kehte ho tiger acchi film nahi deta aur ab kuch accha kar raha hai toh aa gaya panauti lagane Sau baat ki ek baat: If you can't say sweet atleast don't say shit also
The moment I saw this teaser, I was waiting for Jammy with his reaction!
Mera bacha nahi hai tu?
Why can't bollywood be original? Why can't they not stop themselves from copying? Why do we have so much dearth of talent in Bollywood?
Jammy just jealous that instead of casting bobby Jamwal they casted tiger.
rather watch HIT 3 again and again than watching tiger fkoff. in all movies he does same expression, action choreography, dance. same shhiitt again and again. so trite and dry.
Bhai jhil gya is baar to
Like someone said...this is a nice documentary on butcher shops...ladke to ladke..ladkiya bhi doing some butchering ...Cross between KIll and Animal Movie and lot of PLaystation games ..Sharam Karlo zaraa !!!
if the film does good at box office it will only give the makers confidence in their own mediocrity
Bollywood is over 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I use to love your movie analysis, but very disappointed with your recent videos. There could be differences in people's taste in movies. Mandala murders is a good watch for me. I have no expectations with the Baaghi franchise, but the teaser of Baaghi 4 is not bad. It has flaws but there is nothing about so much hatred just looking at the teaser.
I mean sayiaraa made 300+ crores. So stop telling me Indian audience isn't stupid trust me this will make 100+ crores
It was unbearable to watch the trailer.How could someone watch this movie in theatre 😮
Are Tiger Shorrf 96 Tourist Family Dragon Megiziyaan Sui Dhaga Jaisi Classic Filme BanaO Aakhir Kab Tak Boring Action Film Me Kaam Karte Rahoge...
The funny thing is that with this herd mentality of  copying current successful films,  dont be surprised if they do a last minute  reshoot of  certain portions for baaghi  4 to copy elements of Saiyaara and release that in the next trailer....expect to see Tiger singing a song in the climax and then shooting the audience...😂
Animal Salaar Kill Aur Marco Se Man UB Gaya Hai...
Future Become Has Many Largde Voilance Movies But Every  Movies Have Not Done Carrect  Voilance Action...  Baaghi4 Has A Boaring Movie
The trailer for war 2 was as bad if not worse 😂
Tiger Shroff come back
Waste of CGI And Waste up To VFX Zone.. And Story Has Souco...
If one thing I have learned about the entertainment or movies, it is that creators do not care about the authenticity or the genuine effort put behind the success of a movie or series, they see the success and go....oh so we gotta do that...thats the formula. Thats what people like. They do not see why it is successful, they just see that it IS successful and use that surface value to make filmsy knock offs that never works.
Jab teen foot ka sarook action kar sakta h toh koi bhi kar sakta h jawan is the most cringe movie ever made midget idhar udhar uchak raha tha Puri film main 😅
Watch Dhadak 2
Boycott for SSR
Kya hua? Who broke him?
Shan Parasher has literally copied your thumbnail for a review of he same movie fml
Whats wrong with Tiger's choices of scripts. Producers se karja liya hain kya ki badle me kuch bhi kaam karna padega?. He should just stop acting man. Everyone knows his potential. I guess he himself doesn't know. Every time same lame ass story and acting. Only WAR was one of his best movie where he portrayed good acting and action. No overacting no jumping here and there. Just good acting and well choreographed action.
Laziness. Nothing else.   War 2, Baagi 4 are financially successful yet producers, directors refuse to do better.   The action is horrible. There's no gravity and originality.   Also stop sprinkling Sanjay Dutt at every mass action movie. It's hilarious that despite so many appearance as villains, his performance as Kanchachina in Agneepath stood out. Rest felt  copycats.    🔴>>>   But really, where are diverse villains? It's all the same "I am blootd thxrsty villain" with no personality.    Kgf, Pushpa, Salaar, Jawan, Leo, Baby John, and more, had same villain archetype.   Salaar disappoints the most as it has whole tribe and world building. A GOT type setup but does nothing intersing with it's villains.    A disposable villain trying to molevst a woman!  How original!  The hero has no choice but to break his oath!  Never done in cinema before!    <<<🔴    It's not movie makers can't do it. It's that they don't want to do it.  They should be criticise for their cheapness.

sarzameen is ....na sar na zameen...🤣🤣
Trailer dekh k aisa lga ki kahi kasai k dukan mein aa gya
Producers are following trend of such movies having gory violence, blood everywhere in each frame....but seriously have anyone thought what impact such movies do on our young generation is horrible. 😢
Wait.. Wait.. Wait You're saying that Baaghi 4 isn't a spoof movie of Animal
Why are you wasting time on tiger Shroff doing same movies and not of quality movies. He is not listening.
Quality of this move is vice-versa of kill,animal😂😂😂
फ़िल्म : ❌❌❌  कसाईखाने की यात्रा : ✅✅✅

Baaghi 1 action was actual good and grounded ,  😅😅
Baaghi 4------tutorial on how to b a butcher
I think the highlight of Tiger Shroff’s career will remain “choti bachhi ho kya”. Coz nothing else will evoke any emotion from anyone.
Buddy, the irony is that I wouldn't have watched this teaser if not for you 😂
A NEW MOVIE STORY IDEA. A super rich hero who buys all the tickets of Baaghi 4 just to save the world from watching it. ANOTHER MOVIE STORY IDEA. A Squad that works in secret to maintain world peace has to destroy all physical and digital version of the movie Baaghi 4 after bollywood threatens to release it. AND ONE MORE. A team of scientists and doctors discover a vaccine that cures people who suffered from watching Baaghi 4.
That eee from that lady in the teaser😂😅
Few more Bollywood teaser like this, we might see Jammy transform into full blown Critical Drinker!          Never go full Drinker man!
Well teaser was not bad if I speak honest it’s look like animal but what about others movie we see something this in South Indian movie just Marco even kill movie so my opinion first let’s wait the movie and then let’s see the movie hope the story is good and tiger improve his acting that’s what is matter 😊
No matter how much u call out Yeh hota rahega? They want to make money They will still make money
Prank Castle
Mix veg masala sabzi lagti hai 😂
Animal succeeded so Baaghi could fail miserably
One of the most horrendous teasers I've ever come across to this date.
Animal ki copy maari hai bhai, even in the teaser😂😂
I feel sad and disappointed that Tiger Shroff is destroying his career out of desperation to be relevant. He needs to stop listening to people around him, even his own father, and go through scripts to find a good story he would want to tell. He is a genuinely good guy and he deserves all the fame. I hope he finds someone who helps him grow as a good actor too.
A much needed rant.
I watched Marco because you kind of praised it... I had feel the same what you are feeling now .. worst movie i have ever watched..
Bollywood is done man... its a burning hot dump of garbage poop
Let acting and story be different this time ! 😂😂
Worst then john satyameva jayte 2 trailer
Ganju baba is such a pain to watch now !!
It's all started with ROLEX, whites with butchering knife. All are following that.
Bollywood is lack of creativity
Chill Jammy! It's jst black to white..iykyk
Sanjay Dutt had become Pedro Pascal of India. Har movie me dikh jata h.
Screenplay is like kill n marco, story is like animal
They’ll follow “trends” but conveniently always leave out the success of movies where women have impactful roles. Those movies do well!
I disagree with Jammy, this is the most I have laughed watching a trailer. They saw the violence in Marco and Kill and thought "Have Blood and the movie will be hit". Such obnoxious fools
Yes
Who funds such movies when its a sure shot flop
Such a shit movie with violence ! What’s the point ?
Fully Understood your point ❤
Tmlog ko agar yahi south me bnta to bahut accha lgta
Jammy spot on with his background image selection😂😂
Ranbir looks like Sanjay in Sanju movie Sanjay looks like Ranbir from Animal movie
Time to ban Nadiadwala
Story is sanju ki beti tiger se galti se /accidentally maari jaati hai fir sanju the baap takes revenge and clash begin between tiger and sanju
For Sanjay Dutt, maybe he has two young kid and cancer scare so he wants to save more money I guess.
Abe india me English bol rha hai  Hindi me bana lo bhaiyaaa
When I watch Fateh trailer, it was at least interesting. Like it is violent but felt right. Watched this trailer, it felt try too hard and copy of Marco and Animal.
You know its serious when there is no intro music to the video!
Sanjay Dutt should have accepted the 72cr gift from his fan and called it quits... while still somewhat keeping his legacy intact. Or do a Akshay Khanna and only appear 1-2 films a year and that too good ones please!
Its actually sad, the story and screenplay might have actually been good and might have even stuck an emotional connect with the audience... BUT all the gore and bloodshed to make it more like a Marco or an Animal might lead to its demise! Also the excessive gore and bloodshed doesnt even look real!
Why so serious??  That too for movie like baaghi?😂
just the fact that there even exists a  baaghi 4 and a housefull 5 should be cause for concern
Damn bro is really pressed tbh I stopped watching Bollywood abt a year ago and it’s still cringe
Animal hangover . . Rehashed vibe
How to sound like jammy, learn these below words: Unanimously Unintentionally Pragmatic Unapologetic humungous ludicrous  like if you find this funny😅
Jammy, have you ever played cricket wearing boxer ( chaddi) 😂😂😂😂 tiger did. Jokes apart felt bad to see the quality of teaser.
It's a good teaser
Maareesan brilliant movie
even the siren sound before fight commencement. they could have just played baaghi bgm instead of b praak and it would have been more effective. producers really dont know original baaghi film with shradhha has still huge re run engagement on TV. simple , effective.  if only tiger realises his true potential and double down on that, pure action thats it. dont let him speak any dialog.
Tiger really selected very bad movies. I remember Akshay Kumar came as a martial arts wonder kid. That's where Khiladi stuck to him. But quickly changed to romantic films and later as comedy movies.   Tiger should do romantic movies with martial arts as spice on the side. And seriously take some lessons of acting please
Tiger playing cricket in chaddi was more entertaining than the entire teaser
Nowadays Bollywood movies feel like such a waste of money and time and knowing how the newer audience is used to trend changing every 10 days and so much content already there to watch online, it's still absurd that producers think someone will show up in the theatre to watch an exact copy of movies and the same old dialogues is absurd. In my opinion the audience just needs relatable stories or something actually enjoyable to watch, stories which are grounded to reality or something so far fetched that makes your adrenaline rush like animal.
Totally useless.. looks like a butcher advert. Zero plot or logic or soul, just loud garbage 🗑️
never saw jammy so annoyed🥲
Looks like a parody of Animal🤣
It is important for you to make money out of it. Of course, why would you not make a video?
They're trying to copy Marco. It won't hit the same note. Marco took me
Why B prak shouts in every song?
I think you misunderstood, it's Bollywood live action version of mortal Kombat... Songs, dance and fatalities
can bollywpod ever able to make somethimg like stranger things ,wednesday,game of thrones,their brain cells dont think this level i guess
Where is the feel good drama movies gener ???
wow i tried and could not last seconds ..what is wrong here ?
Looks like Sanjay Dutt will kidnap Tiger's Girlfriend like what happens in Baaghi Franchise so easy to predict 🙂‍↕️
"So that was the video, guys. ...handle is in front of you 'Jammypant4'." Outro for those who miss it in this video.
pyar ishq mohobaat stop showing this shit nw, sci-fi,adventure,suspence thriller genre are also exist
bollywood is finished,no creativuty left nt a single gud director, writer left, someone pls hire frm hollywood writers ,directors their creativity is nxt level plus they think above love stories which bollywood obsessed with
Man now every second movie is casting Bobby as villain and audiences are gonna get bored as hell, like sanjay dutt as a villain
Yes salay you are totally dumb
I believe your critiques would be better suited to Hollywood cinema rather than Indian films, as you appear to lack an accurate grasp of the preferences of the Indian audience. Your assessments seem grounded in the framework of Hollywood productions, where narrative coherence and logical consistency hold significant weight. In contrast, Indian cinema, particularly mainstream fare, often places minimal emphasis on logic or intellectual depth 😁. The masses here exhibit a strong inclination toward such entertainment. The remarkable commercial success of many South Indian blockbusters—despite their tenuous relationship with logic—stands as clear evidence. It would not be an exaggeration to say that nearly 90% of Indian viewers favour this style of filmmaking.
They are making black to white....
Actually tiger ka career almost khatam he hai , thorha over Chale gaye isliye 😮  hath pair maar raha hai bachne k liye
This is Housefull5ification of Action genre..comedy tak nahi rahega cringe ab limited
Sajid Nadiadwala script selection pre covid 💪 / Sajid Nadiadwala script selection post covid 🤡 - SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH HIM, HE LOST THE AUDIENCE'S PULSE!
I am waiting for Shan’s review of this teaser. He would hold no punches.😂
Random slime from the Nickolodeon Kids Film Choice Awards. Hahahahahaha. Spot on Anmol. Such a haphazard teaser. Sajid Nadiadwala needs to stop this Houseful and Baaghi franchises. Utter rubbish and waste of time
Cheap copy of Animal spoof
The mask scene was hilarious 😂😂😂they didn't even tried to hide it 😂😂
I feel like this movie is just an attempt to get rid of that black money.. lol coz why else?
Is this joke or what ??? What the FFF I just watched ? So So Bad trailer !!!! Knife & blood scene was comical 😂😂
This is the first movie whose teaser was also unwatchable
While watching the teaser I felt it was a parody of animal. But I also think there is a group of audiences for this. If made on the right budget, it could become a big hit.
Makers have considered us as fools and idiots,just combine 3 hit R rated movies into one. Onscreen Tiger and Sanjay dutt cutting each other to pieces and offscreen fan boy moments,joy,laughter while 24×7 head hangering promotions kills the vibes
I really miss the days off action movie dou sanju baba and jackie dada.
I watched the video for 2 mins and then went for the teaser. After looking at that shit I simply came back because now I feel like to rant.
4:52 Ok for sanju baba i think i can explain, this is probably something that mr unemployed you and vela me cannot understand. Kaam karte rehna hai mereko, kaam. Thats whats probably going through his mind. Salman khan was also making movies swiftly like that at one time as well. Its simply him getting older and he is simply bored. Its just his inner workaholic kicking in. Idk maybe try to seeing things from an artists/actors perspective rather than an unemployed youtubers perspective its easy to sit on a seat, hold a mic and criticize but needing work just to deal with inner boredom is another story. Jokes aside, andar ki baat, i think this is a sanju baba movie not a tiger shroff movie. 😂
Bollywood movie badass hero checklist since KGF and Pushpa,   1. Long scruffy wild beard 2. Long scruffy wild hairstyle 3. Cigar/Cigarette for the badass look 4. Emotional songs (B praak, arijit singh, jubin nautiyal) 5. Cheesy badass dialogues for Instagram Reel lipsync videos 6. Guns/Violence (Over the top)/Koeta/Kukri/Blades/Blood
This was more of an Ek Villain 3 trailer than Baaghi 4
0:02 I think he is going to talk about the unnecessary bloody action not well coreographed  as in many movies began doing as it is being successful.😅
Honestly, this was quite interesting to me. Mindless action and total bs. I have so many things to worry in my life, be it my job and other things, that something mindless like this can be quite fun. Just sit and switch off the brain, some movie that doesn't require intelligence to watch 😂
I had the same thoughts after seeing the teaser
New obsession of bollywood - sonam bajwa... Good she is getting movies...but bollywood always has obsession with one heroine n put them in all movies back to back then boom tata bye bye
Petition to cast Jammy as Bobby Paaji’s estranged brother in Animal Park
Baaghi 4 - if Badass Ravikumar was an unintentionally funny action film😂...looking at the action sequences and VFX...I remembered that masterpiece 🤣🫣
guys, if you wanna have a great laugh, scroll though the comments of the original video, Jammy you should too
WHY YOU ACT LIKE ROBOT. IRRITATING MONOTONOUS TALK READING PROMOTOR WITH SELECTED WANNABE ENGLISH WORDINGS 😅  BHAI HINDI MA BOL LIA KAR
I didn't watch any baaghi films except for the 1st one. Cause i always felt that they were trash from the start. I won't bother even with the teaser of this cash grab garbage if not for you my fav review's video about it.🫡
It’s terrible that talents are wasted on gimmicks
Sahi bat hai enough is enough bollywood should make better and orignal  movie people are not fools tiger shroff is simply talent wasted if he does stuff like this
I feel you Bro. I was unbelievably irked to watch it as well. What a waste of a talent like the hero here 😢
Bro’s accent is pure Apu from The Simpsons, tossing big words like he’s auditioning for a dictionary. Talks Hindi movies but can’t pronounce English, rambles 10 minutes for a 30-second point. Violence trend started with Animal, now everyone’s just copying instead of making good films. Chill, simplify, maybe add some humor—felt like a dad lecture. Half the time I had to use ChatGPT to TL;DR your review. You think you’re a genius, but you’re basically the Donald Trump of movie talk, or may be you have dementia, who knows.
Tiger is not an actor nor can’t be , no matter how hard he tries. PERIOD .
Totally agree with your review but the thing is Baaghi 3 was a disastrous movie and Baaghi 4 looks like a remake of Animal even with BPraak song. I hope they've done justice to Harnaaz as it's her debut
I feel hype for Marco’s Character wasnt worth it
Even Dhurandhar filmmakers emulated The monkey man trailer concept. But they pulled off so brilliantly.
Animal is not really a gory movie, of course, there are few scenes.
Can't wait to watch this movie ..seems awesome
Are Anmol ko Hindi bolna aur samjhna aata hai... I thought Anmol only watch Hindi movies with english subtitles
Tiger ka picture hai, flop toh honi hi hai.
Baaghi 4 is Animal in a Multiverse😂😂😂😂😂
Jammy .  Your rant is futile . This movie will be a super duper hit . ❤.
Tiger & vidyut should do a reality action movies like boyka 3 & 4.
I mean you can copy, but atleast take some effort and copy it from Iranian French or Korean movies. 😊
well, when we saw the trailer of Animal, we felt it had similarities with Fawad Khan's Maula Jatt
Calm down !! Calm down !! 😅
Waiting to see how those Bollywood celebrities will rant about this movie now, just like how they did for Animal…but they will keep quite for sure, if Bollywood does this then it’s pure cinema😂
vanga onset really celebrated, hes just known to be a good director
This movie shouldnt be even baaghi 4  Like they changed action thriller To crime thriller
Now there's a Sanjay Dutt Fatigue too
A - rated movie but it's come to logic there is so much bloodshed it's acceptable but where is the action choreography i feel so much bad for tiger potential cause we saw him baaghi 1 , war and singham 3 but when you takes so much inspiration from other movies it's not going to save your movie
I'm not a Tiger Shroff fan but this teaser looks good  And bro please don't overreact
Malayalam film - "ED Extra Decent". I think you'll like the creative approach
I agree with every single line you said, the trailer was infuriating, and outright tacky and cringe worthy. The bpraak touch was such a waste of talent.
I felt like it's exactly similar to animal...Animal in 144p....post animal, marco and kill bollywood thinks showing blood and knives will save the film....
Do people even care about Tiger Shroff anymore? In top of that when it's a 4th part of a movie that has nothing to do with it's predecessors. He's pretty much travelling on the same bus with Arjun Kapoor
the practical effects of the blood shed are too good that  they are now out on my face , my eyes are red for real
😂 Sajid nadiyadwalaa bhind  for all this shit
I am convinced Sajids movies are just black money laundering schemes 😂😂😂
Pichli teeno remake thi
I hope that either Tiger changes after this film fails or he quits acting altogether.
Absolutely Crappy Nonsense Trailer. Wish the Movie Gets Banned
Woah, have never seen Jammy this mad.
Baaghi,Housefull,Heropanti franchises are the ones which people never asked for but are still being served one movie after other.I thought after repeated failures,Tiger Shroff would make a smart choice with his next but after this teaser,he even dumbed down his choice with this mindless gore/cutting and chopping film.Slick and substance rarely go hand in hand but some indian film makers have been able to make such movies like Goodachari,Kill,Kaithi,Vikram .I dont understand what hurdles do most of the hindi film makers face in making movies that makes use of story and also has some cool action blocks.Gore,blood splashing in every fram,cutting limbs and head doesnt give any thrill or joy in any action movie.Also,I would humbly request Sajid Nadiadwala to stop stupid franchise movies.They are just unbearable
I survived after watching this teaser 🤮omg never watched something so cringe .. and tacky and yacky 😒😒
Bhaagi 4 Teaser looked like a cheap copy of Animal
Blockbuster movie stop your negative thoughts  No one cares for your opinion
Baaghi 4 should have been titled Animal Waterpark
they hired one of the worst directors from Kannada industry. like wtf
Animal rip off and an ugly trailer. Yuck 🤢
Meri taraf se 10-12 gaaliya de de bhai jammy
Houseful 5 earned 200 cr net in India itself. What tanked. Har cheez mein hate. Ajeeb chutiye hai
thank you for opening up so brutally.. this was a crap wrapped in a classic silver foil for audience to burn inside this oven,,.. absolutely no intention to make a purposeless mindless  cinema....
bkl criticism thik hai, opinion bhi thik hai but itna hate.Like u r not criticising, u r projecting something personal on movie. Why so sour? get a life. Hating won't get u anywhere
Stars really don't matter much today as they did back then, right now stars can only elevate a movie and not being the absolute base of it. War2 right now is having way less bookings than expected even after having 2big stars
The way how angry you are and passionate at the same time, discussing the sad state of Indian cinema now, ngl it is low-key attractive 😭😭 or is it the English? I can’t tell, probably both (I swear I don’t have colonial mindset).
I think makers also know what they are doing they just want an average or below average movie where they expect to make 10% to 20% more than a break even point. They are in industry as businessman
in the name of acting worshop, all actors had gone to slaughter house
rambo or hritik ko copy karo ban gya tiger Shroff
pure disappointment from jam jam
I guess they need to know animal just didn't work because of brutal actions. That movie is more of violent family drama.. yes I can say it took inspiration from k3g a lot but it was damn good the emotional drama the connection the stubbornness of Ranbir kapoor to get attention of his father   Those things what made animal succesful
Isiliye bollywood barbaad hai 😵‍💫 Khi kuch shi mil  baith ya click kr gya to baaki sab bhi vhi product dusre wrapping kr k bechne lg jaate hai🙄 Pta nhi kya milta hai isme... Original k bhi maa behen ek kr k bhi nhi mante😅
All of a sudden people have stopped mentioning Kill while talking about Hindi cinema taking gore and violence to the high level of art!
The teaser should also have an age rating, I am disturbed
Baghi 4 is a flop, even before it's release 😢
I am pretty sure Baaghi 4 is gonna win national award next year for the best action entertainer of the year
Yehi agar south ki Hoti to usi waqt chaat rahay hotay.. yehi to problem hai tumhaari
Tiger and Vidyut can do what other actors in the Indian film industry can’t, but somehow they both end up with the worst scripts. I know you’re actors and should submit yourselves to the director, but at least read the script before signing the film.
Bhai tu sahi hai lekin please hindi mein baat kar shashi tharoor se pehle se hi pareshan hai hum log please please you are reviewing baghi  jaisi movie not expendables please please
Bhaisaab yeh toh sirf teaser tha.. trailer toh abhi baaki hai 🫣😱
I guess everyone is in one this except for the producers
Bro i beleive they are trying to create of spoof of some successful actions flicks, just like Hollywood where they have spoof franchises like Scary Movie and Naked Gun. Makers of this film should market it as a spoof than it would get more audience to watch
This happens when you see Story & Screenplay by Nadiawala himself
Haha.. Thought it was a zombie movie with go goa gone seriousness.. Everything about it was laughable, the cgi is cartoon network level😂
Saw this video before watching the teaser, then stopped it halfway to see what they’ve actually done that makes you so vexed  Ok so I’m getting Animal and Mortal Kombat fatalities from the teaser.  I thought the teaser wasn’t too bad other than there is too much bloodshed that has been cut together at once, especially the harnaaz scene making her look like a vampire, who is doing a fatality with her two knives. Other than that, the action looks quite good, and Sanjay dutt in his iconic laugh at the end is giving khalnayak vibes again which I’d love to see on screen.  I get what you’re saying but I think your anger is slightly misdirected - it’s not that bad. I’m more annoyed that movies like Andaaz 2, got the go ahead. It looks like a B grade movie from the 90s, can’t believe you actually watched and reviewed it tbh.   This in comparison will probably make a lot of money. It will create hype for it.
Bro you didn't mentioned, they even also casted Saurabh Sachdeva as Sanjay dutt sidekick, such a copy cat makers 😮😮
Audience will Bhaaghi from the theatre 😅  And I wonder what Javed Akhtar has to say about the teaser ☺️☺️
Dude the director is the worst product of kannada movie industry.. like just imagine, the worst of a dying industry 😂😂 we threw him out, now he's fucking your problem 😂😂
Ngl I saw this in my office and was really confused. I was excited though. Not for the movie tbh but for Jammy to give his thoughts on this teaser 😂
The  teaser was shit..
Sir can read our mind..
Sir it was bad directed trailer. Everyone is chopping something,it doesn't look action but spoof movie
Nadiadwala is making shit nowadays 😂
Tiger is wasted by directors
Ghazab ki tatti bana di 🥵🤣
Jammy you didn’t make video on Coolie? Why is that #makecoolievideo
Only happy for Hernaz kaur she is also miss universe
Idk why producers just want to emulate gory violent bloodshed just because it worked a few times; at least make an effort to make it unique, dawg. These feeble attempts are borderline embarrassing for production houses.
Marco is One of the stupidest movie ever
As much as I feel bad because you are so pissed at this, I live for RANT ANMOL!!! Absolutely nailed it!
What a rant bhai!! Mazza aa gaya. Aap jo keh rahe hai hum vahi soch rahe the
That's the power of Tiger! He finally broke Jammy 😂
We are jumping guns. Let's trailer come. If potentials of Sanjay and Tiger shroff would have been utilized properly it will be a success. Harsha is a very good director with proven records. As a Tiger fan I feel he is back big time❤
Action is looking too forced
Pehle audiance ke liye movie banayi jati thi... Ab movie audiance ko bana rahi hai...😂😂 Kya banega re bollywood tera.. kuch sharm kro😂
Bengal files is way better❤ It will win the clash even though Bollywood puppet media will ignore it😂
Ye video tiger ko dikhao kya ho gya h is bande Ko
Abe Hindi bhi bol liya kr kbhi 😅
It lacks conviction- It's like tomato sauce is sprayed all over them.
I think I was watching MARCO s Chapri Bollywood Version ...... I am happy that they showed everything in trailer itself so I dont have to bother watching it..... These dumbos couldnt even keep me glued to the trailer for 30 secs..... I now think Tik Tokkers were better.... We shouldnt have banned them
The issue with this trailer is that somewhere it lacks the sincerity a film of such genre should possess. You are showcasing us a revenge  drama and for not an ounce I connect with the protagonist in the teaser. On the contrary Animal just showcased minor glimpses of the gore part and focused more on the story quotient in its trailer/teaser. Lot to learn I guess.
How easily actors like sanjay dutt agreed to do these kind of films
Looks like b grade gaming video
Someone in Bollywood should remake or create something similar to "The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent" with Sanjay Dutt in the lead and actually use some of his tacky film clips and references from his recent films. Trust me, Sanju Baba is perfect for the role and very similar to Nicolas Cage, a superstar/actor with immense potential, but who signs mediocre or below-average movies as though he's struggling financially, and has no choice but to sign every film that's offered to him.
Bhai tumne jo bhi bola samajh nhi aaya,lekin ekdum sahi bola. I agree with you
producer be like : ye tho dhoti khol rha hain😁😁😁
This is biggest Matlab kuch bhi Movie of All time from Bollywood
Ronny is back😂😂
tu khudke comments dekhta hai kabhi😂😂😂😂
Bollywood would take a century to make successful movie franchise like John wick , Hadd hai John wick with such a good action scenes but didn't have to be gore action scene.
I was visibly disguised while watching the teaser
Appreciate to know that you empathize with writers like us trying to make it in the industry with originality and pure passion and keep failing at it during pitches because for some reason the seniors just can't stand something new and original it's hella frustrating.
This is a decent trail obviously not bad at all.. if someone did something before me what I thought to do.. that doesn’t mean I can’t do better than him.. just don’t spread hate just for views.. coz this online generation is thriving on hatred..
WOW
Teaser is much better than WAR2
It's not only Animal that they tried aping. They tried slight modifications in whatever has worked. Eg - Yash in KGF full over the top and macho character, he light cigeratte with the machine gun that was hot as red and combed his hair in a combat with a baddie's hand, and lo in baaghi 4 sanjay dutt chops the hand and then uses that hand to light the cigeratte clearly taking inspiration from KGF..
It makes me sad to see how every industry is casting Sanjay Dutt only in villainous roles. Why aren’t people casting him in comedy movies? He has damn good comic timing. He can do gangster roles and also strong character roles. I watched the teaser and thought, “Yaar, kya bana diya hai inhone Sanjay Dutt ko.”
This feels like a fan made ek villian sequel trailer rather than an official movie teaser
You know Anmol's angry when he starts talking in Hindi😂
Baaghi 1 came in 2016 , Later that Year Demonetisation happened  Baaghi 2 came in 2018 , then Kerala Flood happened  Baaghi 3 came in 2020 , C0V1d happened.  Baaghi 4 is coming , what's next (I hope a certain Chaiwala is kicked out of Power for doing unconstitutional things in India) !!  I know thoda political ho gaya but we need to keep that in mind.
At first glance, it seemed like a fan-made teaser for Baaghi #4. I had no idea that this is an official teaser. Even the thumbnail is so tacky , expression less and full of cringeworthy violence...oh God! Completely Horrible.
Animal 2.0 but worst
Can we do something like cancel baaghi 4, plz plz plz plz
Don't worry. There will be at least few more rip offs of animal  Like dhurandhar and many more😂
I can't stop laughing after watching the teaser. 😂 It looks like some cheap Emo Bois sh*t from the 2010s 😂 Sanjay Dutt looks like a 'thakela' version of Aziz from Animal while swinging his butcher's knife. 😂
Tiger Shroff should abandoned Sajid Nadiadwala and baaghi series for his future endeavours
what makes sanjay dutt sign everything? hmmmm ever heard of breaking bad bro?
Wait.. Did you say that The double climax has never happened in Indian cinema before? Well if you consider malayalam cinema part of Indian cinema, then they did it in the late 90's with a movie called Harikrishnans. Check it out and the reason for a double climax!
Breathe Bro Breathe! lol
Jammy bhaiya itna blood pressure high mat karo inke uppar sudrenge to nhi just give us a fast review so that we avoid watching it 😂
Tiger is a good actor. He needs good storyteller.
Bhaaghi 1- Varsham destroyed  Bhaaghi 2-Kshanam destroyed  Bhaaghi 3- Vettai destroyed  Bhaaghi 4- Maro destroyed
Tiger is currently being underutilized. He truly deserves a visionary director who can tap into his full potential, rather than simply using him for superficial stunts and action sequences
Its really disgusting to see the trailer..
People keep bashing on the nepo-women but its some nepo-men who cant act. One of them is Tiger. He is good at dancing and action but thats it.
Will there be a national award?
Was gross...Why are we copying Animal...Is this what we've become...Violent even in our silence...
Bro that sinister laugh bgm of Sanjay Dutt reminded me of Kirmada
Baghi 4 ❌️ Kasaikhana ✅️
Feels like nadiawala house is  on a mission to turn tiger as a disaster hero.. Matlb kuch bhi.. Yr bnde ko simple or sahi project krne do n 😅😅😅
I thought I was watching Marco, Animal, KGF2. Only thing missing were DC and MCU crossovers to make it a blockbuster with 30-60 min world building with AI prompts and extra hour to convince this is CGI bloddshed to get UA certificate.
Animal+marco+kill+hit+rolex (in short all action movie) = Baaghi 4 (Baap of all action film)
Effect of one more Kannada Director following the footsteps of Kabzaa to make another pan India movie. 🙏
Damn bro was done today, you really put yourself through a lot
Your audio isn’t synched with video
Teaser is likea documentry about butcher shop😂
Nadiawala grandson should learn from Tehran trailer
Are Ahmad Khan films just a cover for money laundering there is no other rational reason why he keeps getting to make crap movies
Tiger is one of a kind. He is extremely good in action while being extremely bad in other genres. There is no middle ground. He himself realises this. 😅
Its a documentary of BAKRA EID😂😂.  It was just badly executed. Watch KOREAN movies they showcase high intense scenes in such a simple yet awesome way. Blame some PR and dough-bags who blindly says its a best and all. So much PR shts makes more cringe
Baghi 4 : Butcher ka badla
It's our people's responsibility to not go to theatres to see baghi 4 to avoid sending wrong message to producers.
There will be a group of people who're gonna love this movie but not because of the story, or actions, or songs. Try to identify and stay away from them.
The director is from kannada industry... Don't be surprised if there is a devotional hanuman song in the movie
I feel you bro...your rant is valid. now let's just laugh about it now.....did you see one of the female character throws the villan guy in air just using a sword
Bohot sloppy hai
Haha.... nickelodeon reference they just shitting their shit on audience....in the times when audience is more aware than ever.
when the lead actress lifted the man in the air and tossed him over herself like a ragdoll I just could not hold myself but to facepalm
The same thing if south did we would say wow masterpiece etc.
what are u waffling about
Wtf was this teaser ewww
Animal parody 😂😂
There is a part of me who backs tiger and really wants him to get over.
If splashing fake blood and peddling cringe under the guise of ‘dark themes’ is creativity, then Baaghi 4 just set a new low. This isn’t art — it’s a lazy overdose of gore trying to pass off as storytelling.This Baaghi 4 teaser is a textbook case of the “creative domino effect” — where being angry, killing people 'with artistic fancy', and unnecessary bloodshed are served as if they’re the new normal. It’s not edgy, it’s exhausting.
This dude truly cares for cinema..just can’t miss his angst,pain and suffering he is having to endure watching such films being dished out at us..
Hey Jammy,you are not talking anything about Coolie ,bro?? Show some love for the Tamil fans 😅😅
Rolex and animal last sceen hi bacha h sab movies ko copy karny kay liye . Absolutely bakwas movie lag rahi
When you have a star as flexible and lean as Tiger Shroff, then why not have action scenes complimenting that, what the fuxk is this. Kill is an example they should have been following, not animal which was a completely different film.
bro....trust me...everything is intentional, we feeling this way is the target, they make such nonsense movies to turn black money into white and it is important for them that people find it as cringe as possible
Housefull 5 did well at box office duffer.
The baaghi IP had enough strength on its own to stand, and well be successful. It relied on solid hand to hand combat, and some clean action shots. Only in the third part did the things get inert and static with even the action scenes. But man this definitely looked like a parody of films following the animal trope. No choreography no method. Terrible
trailer trash toh abhi baki hai 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Director : Give me a short and crisp answer to what works in the bollywood box office? ChatGPT: Bloodshed and violence Director: Got it. Thank you!
But even the ladies are kicking butt in this movie. Unlike Animal.
"areey khoon kharaba bada chal raha hai..  .hum bhi karenge"  -sajid, probably
I still think it's a joke the creators will come out anytime now on public to say this was a spoof of animal not the real teaser. However, it might also be true that they think "janta" is dumb and they  will watch any movie with a poster having main lead covered in blood with some sort of weapon.
Animal inspired
The moment i saw some goons with mask i knew it. They are trying Animal Baaghi version
This trailer should be used as an ad for tomato ketchup lmao
sanjay dutt is the worst thing about this trailer though... villain role fatigue, animal rip-off actions, lack of emotional display .. think he was more in sync when performing in housefull5. Also, i n willing to give it a chance because of gory action though god knows what censor board will do. AND it is good to see actressess in action role than in hapless damsel roles..  though i doubt sonam bajwa n debuting harnaaz kaur sandhu will have much to do... saare khanjar aur bhaale to  panthera tigris maar raha hai baniyaan pehne hue.   I have only seen john wick 1. guess i will have to see all the rest including ballerina before i see this movie.. so i can make jokes.. but again i will see on streaming, kaun hall jaake dekhega. it is not something curiously exciting like KILL.
Sassta Animal/Marco
Bhai tu bana de isse achi movie! Ek kamre me bethe bethe video bnana easy hai LAKADBAGGE🙄
I can imagine Vanga ji looking the teaser like Arjun Kapoor meme! *BGM: Ho Underworld me zikra yara ke naam ka* 😂😂😂😂  Like seriously abhi Arjun Kapoor ko feed me dekh dekh ke kamm torcher nahi hua ki abhi yeh Teaser bhi dekh liya🙂
Housefull didn't tank. I expected it not to reach even 50 crores.
baaghi 4 teaser is not the worst one to be honest. previous ones were really bad.
i left the trailer in bw because it is cringe
Let’s hope this year is the end of Tiger Shroff’s career. The best he can do next is join the circus 🤡
I was waiting to correct your English Vocab once at least, ofcourse while I learn a lot from you(especially your versatile usage of complex words) It is Blood Spatter and not Splatter, ofcourse it is a very common mistake Hope you would not mind and correct yourself Love your way of explaining stuff bro, keep rocking!
the same industry mocking vanga for having "violence" in his films doing the same is so funny just accept it that you're actually obsessed with the film in every way possible
I want sanjay dutt as a supporting  role or hero in a feel good movie. His performance in tulasi das junior was so good. That movie is so underrated. I am tired of seeing him as a villain. Atleast the villain arc must be good. But for sanjay dutt it is not good in recent movies that he commit nowadays.
Aaa thuuu teaser hai and physics ki aisi ki taise kr rakhi hai,  For me KILL is by far most logical and brutal movie by these people
These TYPE of MOVIEs PROMOTES "OVERKILL"
cheap copy of animal
Its gonna be a shit-show!! The director has already ruined many Kannada movies. I saw the teaser after your review and dint see anything but the scenes of ANIMAL with same type of clothing with different actors. Guys never believe in this Director especially, he has given our Kannada stars worst movies in their career.
Just because violence is working right now that means we have to turn every franchise which was nowhere close to this tone of  action into this Rather make a fresh film then, when it's Baaghi I expect martial arts, sleak action rambo style action not a South Indian type action People go to Mission Impossible and John Wick and a Tarantino film with different tonalities of action right Just because of the cash grab scheme of sequel value they have to name it Baaghi, if this was a fresh title then there wouldn't have been any issue When 3 movies you have stayed away from so much gore why introduce it now that too in a meme worthy execution of non stop stabbing and bloodsbed, in Baaghi 3 the choice of action type wasn't the problem, the presentation and the nonsense rubbish story was the problem This will be even more of a joke  Let me know what you guys think of this opinion I don't think every franchise has to turn into a South Indian style gory film Kill did it (exceptional execution) that's an original story so it's completely okay
Hey Anmol you stop emulating and Xerox copying anupama Chopra's way of taking Hindi she is not your wife
Yeah, because just like any other weak beta male, Jammy needs strong women to save him.
Sandeep Reddy vanga is like "look what they have to do to mimic fraction of our power" 😅😂
Tiger could be the Tom cruise of Bollywood. He just needs to choose movies like him
Watching Sonup's review after watching Jammy's review is the ultimate dose of comedy for me. I am not at all missing comedy movies now a days😂
Saari bhaddas nikal di
This is same guy who actually liked WAR2.
Hi jammy. Would love to know your thought on gich pich. Independent film
This guy is kinda sexy when annoyed 😂
Short answer: Yes, Long answer: Yes
Arey Yaar Aap Bas Cinema Ke Peeche Hi Pade Hi Rahte Ho, Bhaiya Aap Sab Reviewers Ko Mazaa Karna Aata Hi Nahi Hai
I just don't understand how do they get the audacity to promote such films.
I'm a sucker for women kicking ahss in movies but I would rather watch actresses being a tablelamp than performing action sequences JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT.
What was that teaser 🤣🤣 really wtf 🤣🤣🤣
Jammy when paisa kaala hai tou Maalik bolega Tried formula bana Refused nahi chalega 😂😂😂      Hasn't that been largely the Bollywood case from the 1990s onwards.
What happened to Rambo remake..?
Hi producer please waste money on me
Didn't even watch the teaser to save some time and mental peace 😂
"Kundi khadkhaun ya seedha andar aau?" bro what in the Selmon Bhoi dialogue was that?
So glad you mentioned Vidyut for hand to hand combat 👏🏻👏🏻
Fruit Ninja 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jammy seems very frustrated.... Come on yaar ....cool down.... U can't change mindset of such filmmaker... U know very well na....ki   "Kutte ki dum ....kitnee bhi saal......
Bollywood is full of people with herd mentality
feels like its mutton shop
7:25 the close up shot of her facial expressions after she tossed that guy off was so cringeworthy... i just exited the teaser.
unpopular opinion I liked the teaser
Tired & Refused Production"
End of Tiger Shroff career ? 😮
The fact that Baaghi has got to part 4 tells you everything you need to know about the malaise in the Hindi Film Industry
Now rajvee masand is right.  Vanga is gone test his own medicine .
I guess, I went to watch Baaghi 2. & The action sequences were such a brain rot.  Plot armour. & Cringe dialogue and dialogue. I'm just amazed that it is now getting a 4th part as well.
@Jammy.. hope it's so bad that it becomes cult like Deshdrohi 😂 Sanjay Dutt in chef's apron & cigar.. very Mohanlal from Jailer. And then those bling fask masks .. check out a music group called Glass Beams.
If this happens to be a hit, Tiger Shroff might keep doing the same thing for the next 20 years. I don’t wish him any ill, but this isn’t good for him he really needs to grow and improve.
Harnaaz sandhu lifted that guy like she was lifting a balloon 😂😂😂
Atleast tiger shroff isnt bouncing here and there like a frog.
the movie seems like Animal fan fiction.
Waiting for harnaz to scream RONNNYYY at the top of her lungs 😂😂
Animal + Kill + Marco + Shit load of Fake blood= Baaghi 4
Kudos 👏
This is not movie  It's mutton Shop
and the bl00d went "Puchick Puchik" 😂😂😂
Baaghi 4 ❌ Kasai ka Adda 4 ✅
Abeo... Wo baap ke liye tha... Aur ye girlfriend ke... Waah bhai...
I rarely put out a bad comment regarding something but this teaser had me. Areee bhai .. purposelessly khoon ki pichkariyan udane ka itna hi shauk hai toh ek AD ko boldo khoon ki bottle lekar har do minute main camera lens pe dalta rahega ... what nonsense is this. What Jammy mentioned in his review about that instance where producers downrightly reject any new idea reminds me of the polar opposite characters Peter Keating and Howard Roark from Ayn Rand's book "the fountainhead". We still live in the same freaking world she had talked about a hundred years back!! Nonsense .. just nonsense .. hindi film industry is really testing my love for cinema these days..!!!!!!!!!
Why Why Why??? A Harsha Just Why
🎯💯✅honest👍🏼
They treat the audience like fools and maybe they’re right. Some still buy a ticket just to chase empty illusions.”
First half to dhang ka bana lo fir to 2 ending chalega 😂 best horror film of the year#HF5
The first two Miss Universe from India were so graceful and elegant. This Harnaaz woman is more suitable for Miss Ghatkopar instead of Universe.
Today Sandeep Vanga Reddy is crying after watching this khichrii 🍲 Teaser 😂
What evet however i am big fan tiger...super
The announcement poster generated more hype than this 🙂
Mai toh bas kundi katkhake bahar se hi bhag lunga theatre ke jab ye lagegi 😂
Makers Plzzz STOP ✋ giving fake wigs to Sanjay Dutt, He got his own natural hair which he luk amazing
Did i saw you at PVR logix noida during naked gun ?
As a kid in 6th grade i went to watch baaghi 2 in the theaters and was absolutely blown away with the action scenes!!! Not just because at that time i didn't start watching hollywood films but the movie was actually good and after that I feel the franchise  just went down the drains!!!! I mean on one side there is Kill, gore and bloody but that was just an absolute blast and then there are these mind numbing blood showers that just signal my brain to go take a crocin and sleep!!!🥲🥲🥲
Tiger Last 4 films was Disaster with(same genre) 1. Baaghi 3, Ganapath, Heropanti 2, Bade miya chota miya
shant bhiyya shant ..ho skta h yeh spoof movie ho
I liked the gore done in Kill, but this just feels like some butcher show. Just seems unwatchable and may make someone puke lol. I don't know if there are even creative heads in these studios.
The teaser was one giant fart.  😛IYKYK
I thought it was just me. I was irritated too to while watching and that has nothing being gory its cartoonish.
Baaghi franchise such a Joke Baagi was Hit Baagi 2 was Blockbuster  Baagi 3 Flop Baagi 4 gonna be Disaster 😂
Raid(Korean)+animal+rocky handsome+Kill+Marco they just copied the scenes from these movies that's it.
No man the teaser was good And it's just an action film what do you expect  I feel tiger Shroff is getting targeted for no reason  It's not a content oriented movie  Just go watch and have fun and forget it. Why are you so critical about it
people who laughed at the “Kundi” dialogue assemble here…     seriously “kundi”???😂😂😂😂😂
My thoughts exactly! Bollywood is still learning all the wrong lessons.
The teaser maintains the tinted and downgraded dark feel of Kannada movie and it looks tasteless almost like how a child mishmashes random shit.
this looks like a  vomit between kill, animal, marco and  leo
Audience toh C hai right?  I mean, Tiger shroff is most physically capable Action star of Hindi Cinema who has the capabilities of becoming bigger than Khiladi or even Hrithik Roshan...   But its been like 10 years in the industry and apart from War, nothing, i mean nothing has been impactful from his side...   Making Baaghi 4 intentionally A rated to garner the wave of Animal...  Is the most stupid decision ever.   Animal is unique, hell even Marco is unique...  But if you try to copy them, it will not work!   Making a movie bloody for the sense of making it bloody is stupid... There must be meaning behind it!
Istg war was the only movie where tiger Shroff was used decently given his obvious shortcomings   It is clear that he can't act, so atp just give him well choreographed action and no emotions   And is the perceived standard of the audience so low ki they'll just go to a theater cause gore dikha diya , sasta paani me milaya hua laal colour ka paint fek diya screen pe  This looks so bad it's not even funny
The only creativity they have shown is how many ways the character can kill someone or blood can splatter as much as possible. It could have been simple revenge thriller movie with good action sequence or stunts but no everything has to be over the top 😅
Bro is so frustrated that he is shifting hindi time to time unintentionally 😂
It is clear from the comment section of the teaser of Baaghi 4 that we have millions whose pre-fontal cortex is not developed enough. This type of cinema is for them.
Fruit ninja
5 September me to chala conjuring dekhne 😂
Deadfool
I don't understand why they keep redoing movies that have worked when they have failed miserably in the past couple of years
Now I feel like Tiger would be more successful as a Stuntman rather than as an Actor😅😅
It's not a joke, jokes are supposed to be funny this is pure cringe
Calm down bro , ike it's just a movie, don't like it don't watch it. War 2 has the same beach song Hrithik have been doing since 2019 with the same choreographer Bosco who hasn't been able to get one iconic step out from him, why don't u call that out too cuz he ur fav. Dunking on tiger is easy, also javed akhtar is a big time copy master, vidhu vinod chopra scarred the memory of kashmiri pandits by making a movie like shikara which reduced the plight of genocide survivors to a love story. He's obsessed with winning an Oscar which he will never Get. Tiger Shroff is trying hard that's what matters. Jolly LLB3 teaser is coming out tomorrow watch it an be happy. Also Housefull 5 is a box office success whether u like it or not
I really like tiger in War, he was great! I thought he will act well in this one when i see the poster but this teaser gives me a headache...why do they repeat something which is already done, maybe they know this will be success as animal was or atleast it gets the limelight because of all the trolling and comparison
very well said bro!
What I think, they take trolling and memes too seriously(with a very delulu mindset, considering satire and irony as literal compliments), the Brain rot movies are increasing and their quality is decreasing. To be honest, they are just not trying effort. Take Mahavtaar Narsimha for instance, the movie had it's flaws, but the efforts and their sincerity towards art is something you can feel , and really enjoy and appreciate, making the sequel hype. Even Animal is a movie I consider illogical with many Plot holes , but the effort of major lead roles actor made it entertaining. Even Chavva had some flaws , but the effort of the lead and director made it a memorable experience.
What a dumb teaser .. everyone is getting cut or cutting someone 😂😂
Nadiadwala productions is next Pooja entertainment! 😂
Mann watched a lot of kannada movies directed by Harsha but wtf is this. Looks so bad cant imagine he was same director who made bajarangi movie
Honestly i was bloody surprised to see the movie taking violence literally too seriously like almost bloodshed in every scene. But i feel it just doesn't work anymore unless they impress us with good storyline. Action waction sab apni jagah hai, content is the ultimate king. Honestly i wouldn't be surprised if this movie turns out to be worst as everyone know it's a bloody Tiger movie. And Sanjay Dutt ? Why ? Like why ? Why this only man for villain roles ? It has become a fatigue now. I mean except Dhurander none of his villain roles excite me now. Please stop casting him as villain. Give him something like comedy, emotional or soemthing different.
Baaghi 1 - Girlfriend Kidnapped  Baaghi 2 - Daughter kidnapped  Baaghi 3 - Brother kidnapped  Baaghi 4 - Animal movie Kidnapped  Baaghi 5 - Audience Kidnapped  Baaghi 6 - Paad kidnapped
Animal lite 😂
Horrible teaser of Baaghi 4.
The makers would have fixed everything if they had just added a tagline in the end. "Baaghi 4: The parody of an Action movie"
Is it bad I didn't mind the teaser...  Like ik it's probably gonna suck but the movie looks better than baaghi 3 imo
This is a joke. Indeed
It's not about acting; it's about the story. Just look at war movies: his acting was peak, but the producers always make him fly in every film, as if he's Superman. I don't think they even realize what they're trying to create. If Tiger Shroff got a movie with a proper story, he might rise again in the industry.
India me jb tk cinema hai.....log toh...........🤐
Why Bollywood producers put so much money in such craps?? ..
Don't know but trailer look so copied and following trend didn't feel that way like I felt when I watch dhurandhar or animal also marco coz also of the background music
Sajid nadiawala is just rolling out houseful and baaghi franchise without proper scripts
Bhai itna direct mat jao defamation laga dega koi🤔
Baaghi 4 teaser ❌️ Mutton shop ✅️
Again a good for nothing movie on the floor.
They should also study how nadiadwala keeps his production house running with this many flops or is he using these movies for smth else..
Seems like seth Rogen was right through out with Studio sadly irl😅  And jammy I have played Battlefield 6 beta and omg nostalgia hits so hard.Feels like an old gem truly...I hope u also try it too
My first two thoughts which crossed my mind while watching the teaser were  1. Is Sanjay Dutt mute just like Lord Bobby? 2. There's B Praak!
This disapproves Amir Khan's logic that people not watching bollywood movies due to its planned release on OTT in 4 weeks. I believe no one will watch such BS even if its direct to OTT. How ignorant these producers are still in 2025.
Sometime when you watch a bad movie you feel you won't get two hours of your life back. Today I am experiencing the same watching this teaser.
Bakwas band
Thankyou finally someone
The story of sanjay dutt doing these movies has to be studied
Spot on video man! You’re the best India movie YouTube with such logical and detailed opinions. 👏
Sanjay Dutt looking the same as Ranbir in animal and b praak singing during a fight  Trying to bank on animal movie vibes 😂
I know the reference for solid gore and killing, in terms of Box Office was Animal and Marco. But the problem is that those movies are already far from perfect, and when people who just wanna decrypt what worked so well, a lot of them miss the mark. Animal would have never worked with just violence, it's already a mediocre story but the acting of its cast, as well as conviction of its director and its music, made it a blockbuster despite its disjointed narrative and problematic themes/scenes.  I have big hopes for Dhurandhar but till now, the only recent movie that genuinely had a decent story with the right emotional chord throughout while having gory scenes was Kill.
True...
Baghi 4 is a Animal spoof
Chapriyon ka stallone
it should be  big time flop but i m sure it wouldnt bcoz yahan ki public pagali hai
I think you are just overreacting..you would be appreciating the same if these was made by a south actors.
And people also liked marcos which has no story and bad blood vfx, i really hate that movie , kill movie was the best movie story wise and actionwise as well but movie like animal and marcos and bhaghi just want to cash violence, and film critics ( i don't want to name them ) orgasming over marco
another flop
Shant ho ja BHIDU.  Jhad laga
कभी कभी हिंदी में भी बोल लिया कर भाई अंग्रेजी मूवी का थोड़े ही बात कर रहे हो।
Animal lite pro max
But what makes this different is that Tiger is doing all the stunts and action himself without help with special effects.Thats the forte of these baaghi movies
Heroine throwing someone in air 😅
We love Tiger Shroff ❤❤❤
There are three states of Violence in a action movie   The Disnified - The realistic - The Ridiculous.   The Disnified. People flying 20m away from a punch. Falling from great heights and getting clubbed but a 80kg hammer with zero blood.   It works for kids movies because duh. (although kids are very much aware of blood and see far more than most adults in day to day. It's comes with being stupid and having friends)   But it can horribly ruin a serious movie. Also anyone getting punched with that much force would get squished.   The realsitc. It's gritty, anatomical and grounded. Most R rated action movies actually fall here. Which includes Marco, Hit and Animal.   Real people bleed, have flesh and can be torn apart. It's just the reality of things.   This can be mild like Raid movies to excessive but still real like Marco.   Then there is the ridiculous. Like Evil Dead or the Boys. Just off the rails. Baaghi 4 falls near this.   Because you can literally see that the "blood" was thrown from a bucket off camera.  Faking Realistic violence is art in itself. It requires knowledge of human anatomy, skill to hide the trickery and some damn good props and prosthetics.
Not to mention, the lines used in teaser were very similar to ek villain
Animal had great music & phenomenal performances from seasoned actors. With technical genius. I dont think this movie will offer out of these 3. Toger should go to Hollywood
No Intro!   Bro Jammy is pissed bad time!
Ye to Tatti hai
Bhai Sanjay dutt ko koi rok lo 😑
Jammy Bhai ka buhat mo0d off hai yaar....😅😅😅
Jammy, i would suggest you to add a few more information on screen than just saying it verbally. Like for example showcasing how much were previous baagis collection vs the budget. This brings a whole new dynamic and makes the video more engaging and informative.  Just a suggestion
The BGM, Sanjay Dutt's look, the action 😂😂😂 no comments
Nooo.....kundi khadkau ya sidha andar aau......u did bad to us jammy.....I went to watch the teaser and want to wash my eyes with acid now... I was happy not knowing about this teaser's existence
I have thought about Tiger Shroff. I might have had the most expectation and optimism about Tiger Shroff. Because you don't need to be a good actor to be good at screen. There are people like Keanu Reeves, Jason Statham, Arnold Schwarzenegger. It is especially true for Bollywood where Salman is the most successful actor in terms of loyal fanbase, bar is not that high. Tiger has amazing body, can dance, do acrobatics, has the look. As the narrator said, Tiger's problem is that he is not able to carve his own style and identity. As a fan of good dancings, I can say Tiger is amazing dancer. But I can't say I am any thrilled looking at his dance because he has been doing the same thing for a decade now. He has remained static and stagnant on arguably his biggest strength. He should try different genres of dancing than just usual quick footworks. Tiger still has time.
Something felt off about this video, sounded weird at first.. Looks like jammy's editor forgot to add background music 😂😂
In Baaghi -  Shraddha Kapoor got Kidnapped  In Baaghi 2 - The Little Girl got kidnapped  In Baaghi 3 - Ritesh Deshmukh got Kidnapped  In Baaghi 4 - Who will get kidnapped?
I was just laughing throughout the trailer.
Bruhhh please make one coolie analysis video 😭😭
'A' Harsha
As a Kannadiga i tell you,once A Harsha made such wonderful movie's initially but his recent work's are horrible.
Exactly  what's the point if nobody cares nowadays  being dumb is new royal mujhe to pata hi nahi hai
When I rethink what I saw it gives me nausea and makes me throw up
Sajid nadiyadwala has alot of black money he is making more and more movies with huge budget to flops so he can make it white money 😅😅
Damn!! Jammy was absolutely pissed like I am. The violence here  feels hollow bcoz of the terrible CGI. A silver lining for me was Tiger's dialogue delivery and some of the camerawork. Otherwise it looks like an overkill.
Sale Hindi me bol😁
another important fact i want to shed light on is this new gen of actors totally losing their mind post covid. i am talking about varun dhawan, tiger shroff, sid malhotra, ayushmann khurrana, ranveer singh, Raajkumar rao and even arjun kapoor etc. all of them seem so clueless. they created their own comfort zone in films but post covid when south indian style big scale action entertainers or violent films or sequels(or universe) started to work, they just left everything and started to run after this formula. I strongly believe they should have stuck to their forte. maybe a few pictures would flop but then films would surely start to do better. a film like 12th Fail is an example. not everything suits everyone. not everyone can pull off a large scale action entertainer.
Baghi franchise used to remake south films but never thought they would remake animal 😂😂😂  It was some bad sh*t
the day tiger closes his shirt the day he achieves things if you are in a mind set of an action hero always what's the point even prabhas or sharukh like actors have done dunky,radhe shyam just to get rid of  monotony even though they are not successful its high time he closes his shirt really man i am literall getting irritated does he the only person in india to have six pack or what i think even if directors says no he would still chose to showcase his abs
4:39 Wait.. what ??? Tiger shroff have die hard fans???
At this point,Jackie Shroff,even at this age has far more acting range in his roles than his son ever had in his whole career!
They thought they would increase the Rotten Tomato score by using more tomatoes as bloodshed
I dont get it why the likes of Sunjay Dutt is doing these kind of pictures.Since Agneepath he has been a villain,his recent work in KGF was very good as it was a fresh look.But here he wearing those loose clothing is just a dead giveaway to bobby deol's character in Animal.
Every actions is forced...its nothing but a another trash.
Why is THIS ANIMAL 2 😂
Why so much Hate and negativity? Why?
I have given up on Bollywood movies long back. No interest at all. Instead I usually watch top notch Korean dramas. OTT zindabad. Never seen such a downfall this worse for this industry.
We barge in an argument or do a nasty rant about these films u mentioned, But what if these movies are just a money laundering scheme ??
I was waiting for the song to start in the background. Sab kuch hi mita denge...🎵
Another Teaser with literally no heart in it. It is written all over it that this is just a cash grabber in the name of violence
Baaghi ❌Bhagoo ✅
To answer your question "Kahan se ata hai formula" kabhi black money ka naam suna hai... Money laundering 101... Do you think sajid nadiadwala gives a damn if this films flops or earn 0 rupees
Male-female,young-old all are equally presented as a killing machine.I am not saying that females cant do action or cannot have violence.But the introduced actress throwing aways that person along with her poor expression was so bad.😅
as many people have said the action should have an emotion to why it is happening seeing the teaser, the action felt unnecessarily too much and the blood splatter is way too much making me not watch the frames.  and it looks like the action sequences are meaningless. i hope the story is decent
Its all about how you shoot a scene , a slap can be more impactful then someone  ripping a person's heart out . Its all about depths given to characters  not gore and violence
Bagghi 1 is one of my Fav movie.May be Copy but it has a heart.
The blood and gore looked so fake 😂
I lost it when that thin lady lifted that dude with two swords with ease like deadpool.
It will be a garbage ! 😂
Tiger and Arjun K are the go-to actors when a corporate needs a film for write-off purposes for that financial year. Ask chatgpt "Write-off by a film producer-corporate from a flop film.. how does it help it financially for that year?"
What was that teaser? Baaghi franchise has lost the plot, the first 2 were genuinely enjoyable movies.  After War, I don't remember a good Tiger movie/performance.
Whoever came up with the idea that baaghi should be a franchise should be sentenced for War Crime.
I discussed this with my colleagues after Animal success during which my senior said abhi ye chal gayi na iske baad aise hi 5-6 aayegi jisme khoon dikhayenge lekin story B grade movie jesi hogi then I saw this teaser. Damm was he right about this.
Chal be chuu 😂
Brother you're wrong there. B praak touch in Animal end was just another dump in the great layers of disappointment that was the film.
Jammy brother the fact that its a teaser trailer baaki hai 🤕
This is the most frustrated I have seen Jammy...😂
Good job dude!
Blockbuster looding 💯👀  Tiger come back 🎉
You forget to mention kundi khadkau ya sidha andar aun hahaha spoof
Like i mean they are not even trying to hide 😂😂😂 marco+animal
Badhazam 4
As a avid viewer of Kannada cinema the worst director of kannada industry is A Harsha I was 100% sure this movie was gonna be shit when i saw his name , give this man budget of hollywood movies , the best cinematographer and hans zimmer the movie will still be horse shit, Bajrangi 2 is still etched in my head , i recommend it to you if you think martin was the worst from the industry
0:04 but views because we all have opinions 😂😂😂😂...we all know this is a kachra movie comments mai real content milega😂
*Plagiarism Detector Hacked*
what do u expect when a crackpot director like a harsha directs film😂😂😂😂
Shame on actors for even picking such script even tho they are well established in this industry.
felt like i watched a promotional video of some butcher shop. so cheap. so ewwwwww. so dumb. also i just remembered i really really enjoyed baaghi as an early teen. connected with the love story. liked the Redemption of tiger and obviously the action was refreshing for me (as i had very limited knowledge of thai action films).
Atrociously bad
"Imitation is the highest form of flattery that mediocrity can give to greatness"
It was all okay untill the action became over the top. 🥲
B-grade movies looks better than this
Don't expect a film to be a life lesson, It is trending so they imitate the trend    though, it will fall flat
Bai tum tv serieal ka review karo mar daar wali review tumse hoga nahi
Agreed
Ek dum tatti teaser 😂😂😂
Nadiadwala and Grandson production has me worried for the upcoming Shahid and Vishal Bhardwaj movie that was titled Arjun Ustara which was cool and they changed it to Romeo fucking Romeo the cast stacked with Talent Shahid Tripti Randeep Vikrant Nana....but this production house worries me man...I hope in making a massiest story of Vishal Bhardwaj as the production house is claiming from the beginning I hope they don't mess it up...Chances of a gangster story for the ages Are low and has me worried just because of this production the Stacked talent will get wasted if this happens😢
They just want to make a more gore movie than Kill.
Directors should stop hiring Sanjay dutt as a villian for literally every movie nowadays....😭😭I am so fed up!!
Feast of Blood VFX. 😂
shut up and keep crying Anmol. Amjad Khan for the win.
Seems Sajid Nadiadwala has lot of black money with him that's why he is producing such type of movies Heropanti 2  Housefull 5 and now this shit Baaghi 4. Bhai itna paisa hai toh hume dede 😂😂😅😅
4:36 I'm sorry just came back as my soul was just about to leave my body and then Jammy mentioned 'Die Hard'😅😍 Man, what a movie!!🤩❤‍🔥
Lets just take it as Animal parody or spoof😂😂...
This product will fail, the stupid makers have no accountability.
Jaise hi punjabi gana chalu hua waise hi trailer band kar diya
Jammy is triggered 😂
I'm sorry but if this was a South Indian film, these crticism would have been showers of praises instead
Bro, I don't think I've seen you this angry ever before! Wow! But this was much much needed, thank you man!
bro calm down..have some water ..i am getting worried
Arey yaar trailer/teaser Violent banane se koi story accha mahi ban jata yar . Inn logo ke demag me kab ghuse ga yeh bat.
so this film doesn't deserve the intro I guess =_=
I enjoyed Sanjay Dutt smoking from a cut hand I am the only one who had fun Also, this is a teaser. So, trailer will tell the story.  You don't like it, but thoda zaada nhi ho gaya Jammy? To each his own
Blood ❌ liquid simulation ✅
Why are you wasting time on nepo kids you should make videos on kaushalji vs kaushik , kaalidhar lapata , ajey the untold story of yogi,nikita roy there is no need you to rant about nepo kids movies their acting will never improve so please don't ignore good cinema for stars and nepokids.
Houseful 5 was a success
Just ignore it and move on.
You know its a serious rant WHEN THERE IS NO INTRO...
Is it wired if jammy frustrated videos entertain me 😅
They should put a 1 min warning before teaser 😭😭
Bruh, Jammy is pissed
BAAGHI 4 ❌ TIGER KI G@ND PHOD ✅
My first reaction after watching teaser. “Okay ,no story”😂😂😂
who will say no to the producer if he has written story and screenplay for his production? People handle their franchises with care but Sajid is killing them instead. Maybe for the better.  Hopefully he is just a producer in Arjun ustara.
Jammy is scaring me. Abhi nikalta thodi der apni Scorpio mein Director ko todne. 😅
Now we will see a lot of love story sh1t in upcoming days after success of chhapiyara (saiyara)
please start doing the trailer  reactions ..please please
Honestly, Animal was just okay, and Marco was terrible. Baghi 4 was made just for the sake of making a copy of both films.
The gory and voilence in  animal and especially with kill made  sense beacuse of the  context, the emotion attached to it and the equipements they had at that time.
Honestly, it's bloody and action heavy but even the action in trailer isn't really having any good impact. Like imagine Raid: Redemption, the action in that feels heavy. The action in Kill or John Wick feels like it's have weight and has consequences. But this just look meh at best and leave at interval at worst. Moreover these action scenes were choosen for the trailer. So this is the glimpse of the best they have to offer.
Another baaghi!?? Man you gotta be kidding me! Why just whyyy😭
Tiger should fully pivot to music. He is genuinely talented in this area. In terms of acting he is The Twinkle Khanna of his generation.
Don't criticize let movie come out
This teaser looks like watching violence at a Butcher shop. there are humans only not animals 😂😂😂😂😂
Who even takes this franchise seriously?😂
Your struggle is real 😂
Kill Bill x Animal. I think its a spoof
Violence needs emotion and consequences behind it to feel grounded. In Kill, every kill had an effect on the protagonist and the antagonists physically and psychologically. Whereas, in the Baaghi trailer the violence feels weightless and inconsequential, As the audience I wasn't able to feel the weight behind every punch and stab and ofc the non-use of practical effects.
The director is an expert at producing blockbuster flops at the box office.
Saw the notification and immediately clicked on this video knowing how pissed off u will be 😭😭. I don't even think so this video would have been up there if the movie name wasn't baaghi 4. All this kills and this unnecessary action is just made to revive this franchise (which was not needed at all they could have made flying jatt 2 where tiger will be saving us from a villain who gets his power from dirt water it would have taught us something ig) but yeaa they know this movie is gonna work and if people can go in theater to watch pushpa 2 kgf 2 or saalar they are definitely going to watch this movie (me being one of them) and yea Sanjay Dutt should stop with this villain who smokes with anything he finds tired of seeing him as a villain jabh dekho koi na koi actor aake marke chale jaata hai 💔💔
I mean what can you expect from baaghi and Tiger Shroff.. absolute shitshow
I felt like it was a parody... And if it really is that.... That would be awesome!
I now feel like the baaghi franchise is only for turning black money to white.
Is it a Zoobie , Slasher or Horror ???
I’ve been a fan of Tiger Shroff since 4.4.2014, when Heropanti’s first look dropped. Back then, I was such a diehard fan that I even ran a fan club 😅. But I shut it down after watching Baaghi 3.  In his early days, Tiger had that rare screen presence and agility in action that no one else in Bollywood could match. I was in 8th grade then, and he felt like something new. But after Baaghi 2 opened to 25 crore, people started showing him in the exact same way in every film. Instead of associating him with strong filmmaking, they began adding action sequences just to make the movie “saleable” to his fans — like in SOTY2, where Karan Johar even asked Punit Malhotra to add extra action just for him.  Tiger has so much potential, but apart from Siddharth Anand and Sabbir Khan, no one seems to use it properly. Siddharth did it right in War, but most others just treat him as an action machine without giving him a proper script or story.  Their recent deliberate attempt to replicate the Animal vibe is quite obvious. I just hope they focus on giving him a solid screenplay and engaging story to keep audiences hooked. Otherwise, his career risks going downhill and that would be a real waste of his talent.
They thought that now violent movies are trending and didn't care about action choreography 😂
I am a die hard fan of Sanjay Dutt but I agree 100% with you about what you said about him. At this stage of his career he should pick and choose the movies he's signing very carefully.
They bought 10000 Tomatoes from Azadpur Mandi on discount and made Baaghi 4 while playing tomatino.
Perfect example of overusing anything=bad product 😮
Sajid Nadiadwala is a genius of marketing and selling his films. Too bad, his scripts are far from even decent.
Worst movie trailer of this year till now
Laughed out so loud once the B Praak track was cued.  The blood splattering everywhere felt like it was supposed to be a comedy slasher film. 😂
i don't know if is this a serious film or spoof film anymore
I just don't understand why these kinds of film keep finding backers, why they just keep rehashing a idea that worked and poorly imitate it and just think it would be a super hit movie, man the types of films we're getting the future is bleak for Bollywood
man that  integration of punjabi song ( bootleg bpark and booby deol ) was the most cringiest  thing i saw in long time
Bollywood needs to get rid of these old producers who are disgracing the old industry like Nadiadwala. Consistently giving bad films. I see some resurgence with Maddock taking over which is good. Dharma also has sold its stakes so they are not making unnecessary movies. YRF will hopefully shut down its Spyverse after War2
6:55 b praak has never impressed me honestly
I'm against censorship but in this case I make an exception: ban the movie, burn the reels and harddrive.
you mfs get bored whenever tigers movie come and suddenly get fresh your father from south start doing same thing
Honestly, the Baaghi 4 teaser feels like it’s missing soul — comes across more like a cringe fest. Ahmed Khan seems to be chasing trends rather than creating something fresh (reminds me of Raksha Kavach Om -he was one of the producer). Surprised this even got greenlit. Also, Sanjay Dutt as the villain yet again feels like the safest, most overused choice. The only slight positive is seeing female characters getting some action scenes.
Black money white karne ka dandha hain aur gadhe har frame ke liye reference maangte hain ...take bollywood to delhi
Unpopular opinion: I am not at all hyped for War 2. I believe it will be trash.
Baaghi 4 trailer is Extremely rubbish. And the violence is almost cartoonish. Fake as F. Literally copy from other movie.
Sanjay looks exactly like ranbir Kapoor in animal is this a multiverse of angry young man
tu bana le movie with your disgusting woke mindset and themes ??
Atleast looking better than war2
Saiyaara x Animal x Kill.  Creativity is dead.
To be honest ma toh confuse ho gya...matlab mjhe action set piece bure nhi lge but ye animal, marco aur saiyaara on coke lg rhi h
I'm sorry. For me, watching Baaghi movies is as painful, or rather, as unpleasant, as getting a root canal at the dentist.
Why bollywood wasting tiger Shroff like this? Sad.
Funniest teaser i have ever seen 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
To the everyone present here, watch the Teaser of Lokah: Chapter 1. You will be enamoured, with such a little budget they have accomplished a feat. Only thing that scares me is the Chapter 1 part.
I don't know when Sajid Nadiadwala understand that now days only CONTENT movies are working, Look what Mahavatar Narsimha did close to 200 Cr. world wide box office. This production house last three big movies are FLOPS:- Chandu Champion, Sikandar & Housefull 5.
Bollywood movie makers just want to push any random punjabi song it doesn't matter for them that it makes sense for the audience or not
You are wrong tiger is a lion
Bhedchaal.  Its just bhedchaal.  This teaser is just shit written all over the place
The best violent movies are the one which holds on /are submissive in showing bloodshed n violence just compare kgf2 ( with its rampage) with joker ( just 3 kill) It's evident that people have become de sensitise and wanted to watch real physiological and real violence i mean , just watch texas chainsaw massacre even without one drop of blood shown it's hell lot scary and nerve wretching
Animal ko copy kr liya sath me B. prag maybe singer ka naam wrong ho, usko bhi song de diya,  Or jab action movie krte h to disha patni ko le liya kro,  martial arts ki training krti rhti h, acting to tiger se bhi nahi hoti h, abhi actresses se bhi nahi honi, kam se kam tiger k sath disha ka action match to krta
mohit bhai said that his favourite tiger Shroff movie is war and i couldn't agree more. sidharth anand is the only director till date to have utilised tiger Shroff properly
In the scene where that girl kills someone in a wedding setting and the guy just flies off I was like wtf 😂 that was the moment I realized, NAAAHHH!
You just recorded and uploaded. No edits. That clearly reflects your frustration.
There was a lessor know  director back in the day called satyajit ray he said - indian audience celebrate mediocrity.......and it's true still they enjoy dump and that's what they get.....and this one looks like animal and marco took a massive dump
Man when I saw the teaser, I was like fs they are going a different vibe as compared to its prequels, which got me a bit excited, but it still looks so bad. Not only it seems like it's a marriage between "Kill" and "Animal" and "Marco", just look how bad those effects are. Like a little stab and 2 litres of blood spilled out is ridiculous to me. I just hope that it feels little better than we are expecting...
Unpopular Opinion - Baaghi Franchise is the Brand Of Tiger Shroff 🫠 Hope, Baaghi 4 atleast be a Good Entertainer 😌
Total CGI Bloodshed. WRITER thinks we're unknown to Korean Gore Movies. This is just Absurd, Tiger deserves better.
They’ve included so many violent scenes in the teaser that, for me, it loses its impact. It doesn’t even feel like one person is killing another — it’s more like chopping vegetables with red water splashing around.
Isliye i don't watch movies in theatres .
I feel disappointed as kannadiga. Harsha A is a decent director if not bad. If he had just moved on with his style - Hero being related a hanuman bhakt and facing a unhinged villain would be still a average movie like Varjra kaya.We wouldn't have gotten this crap.
Directing brutal action is no joke, it's an art and these idiot half knowledged movies makers don't understand that art. This literally felt like a butcher doing his daily chores 🤮
what is wrong with movie industry? why is violence so much glamorised and presented as cool? Not just bollywood, in every film industry it seems the more gore and violence a film brings up, the cooler it becomes.. So much killing and blood in the trailer itself.. was not necessary.. seems the producers want to capitalize on violence, gore and blood.. story seems to be the secondary factor...  We already have so much of violence and hatred all around us.. Humanity is already getting lost.. cant the movies at least be a little good? maybe movies should be such that it would promote humanity, insteas of these things
I was confused whether its blood or juba kesari in teaser
Whatever Jammy is saying......Shabd Mere Hai😑😑 Poori teaser bhi khatm nai kr paaya tha...itni buri thi 😒😒😒😒
chill bruh
Either you make the movie look stylish for the blood gore genre you are approaching.. But this looks dirty.. Not in the grimy gritty way.. Just horrid to look at.. Oh man this gonna ruin action movies fr
Jammy please make a video on Mrunal Thakur, how she is not getting any big opportunities, whereas so many mediocre nepos keep getting chances after chances. Sadly she got a film like SOS2 which did nothing to her career as we can see the result at the box office.
one more thing why every miss world miss universe miss India end up doing acting that too not acting just face and showing glamour  When they are on stage they say I will do good for the environment people and animals but end up in bollywood
Tiger shroff mutton shop😂
Chill...its money laundering...tactics
Damn no intro Jammy?…this is gonna be a banger video
Why is Sonam Bajwa choosing such movies? She is ruining her career.
Inn ko lagta hai ki hum sab chimpanzee hai
It looks like the producers directors had extra money and didn't know what to do with it so they made this downright cringe fest action movie. If you can even call it that.
Watching this teaser, my reaction was literally Johan Hill and Leonardo's reaction at this timestamp in this scene! 😂  https://youtu.be/ltpan46ojAA?si=3u25sxfrmoNfiLEi 1:25
Sabko chaaku chalani hain ab 😂
Bro is really frustrated 😂😂 full on rant but i agree with you
What we were afraid of Animal then- is now coming true..poor and cheap immitation with wrong social messaging,gore,bloodshed,violance affecting a younger generation detrimental to society..  Don’t get surprised if this movie become blockbuster and crime rate in country shoots up.
Sanjay dutt is even in KD, which is gonna be a massive flop from Martin 😂
I think we need Riteish Deshmukh shouting out for Tiger Shroff again. Just saying.
Tarantino started a trend of Hyper violent films which are now misused by bollywood. Jammy please react.
Housefull 6 is coming next year right? 😆
Similarly, Akshay needs to abandon the Houseful franchise
Thanks for not making video on coolie trailer
What else did you expect from an actor whose last movies are Heropanti 2, Ganpath, BCMC and Singham Again 😂
Anmol's rant >>> Baaghi Teaser
Bas yahi reh gaya matlab kuch bhi saare maar kaat kar do and Sensor board 🛹 it laughing in the corner 😂😂😂😂😂
‘KUNDI KHADKAU YA SEEDDHA ANDAR AAU👻’
The violence looks fake and this is just a ripoff of Animal, Marco etc.
super video
All hopes on Param Sundari, Conjuring:Last Rites, Black Phone 2 and Kathanar- Wild sorcerer for me now. Hope coolie deliveres..my first FDFS (630am)!
Sanjay dutt should be selective
You know its far from being saved when Jammy is losing his cool.
It's so try hard that it's funny 🤣  Bollywood still going copywood in 2025
Feels like someone tried to make Animal and Marco from memory. That someone having undiagnosed dementia of course
TIGERIANS TO JAMMY - ( insert cringe kundi dialogue)
I'm not seeing the teaser on YT. Did they pulled it down?
The teaser was so funny, hope they do a Badass Ravi Kumar
Big Budget B Grade Animal Movie!!!  Seriously yaar, Now whenever I see Sanjay Dutt in the role of a villain in any movie, I am sure that this movie will also be bad.
Baaghi 3 = 2020 = Corona virus 🦠  Baaghi 4 = 2025 = or 2026 me duniya khatam
2025 Natioanal awards winner candidate is here
I had commented this on your housefull 5 review as well, and am posting a modified version here again:  I digress that a very big flaw in Indian culture as a society today is that people in power do not care. Be it in administrative, entertainment, or any other field.   Take the RCB stampede, competitive exams, flooding of towns and cities after the first monsoon shower, or the supply chain of abysmal movies despite each being rejected by audiences.    Animal, and maybe even Saiyara in the future, will be poorly imitated by these clueless but powerful producers in the future. And then they’ll question audiences when the movies bomb.  The influential people in control don’t care about the output as long they have the power both figuratively and financially. And the biggest irony is that this “power” is given to them by us common folks. It sounds so easy to be taken away, yet it can’t. What a tragic, vicious cycle.
Bollywood has run out of ideas   1 - Its just copy paste 2 -same template  3-marxist propaganda ,only anti hindu content with no guts to create content on other communities 4- india pak (no exploration of india bangladesh, india china, new india pak stories) 5- high inspirations from hollywood (with no indian elements) 6- very few indigenous stories,infact they r mocked 7- fake  collection reports  8- too much reliance on stars 9- no importance to writers  10- directors r not well read about indigenous stories( a movie on aurobindo thoughts on CONSCIOUSNESS in a feature film format. Imagine the feeling. But for that they will have to read and be proud of Indian heritage)
Not Sonam bajwa choosing the worst scripts for her bollywood debut 😭
bro am not a fan of tiger but ur the one who praise marco and hit because its south i loved the teaser and am happy that bollywood trying to bring the mass cinema which they forgot after ages because after all bollywood is the og of mass from 70s and 80s  try to support bro dont spread negativity in every movie just because its from bollywood
Its just that they think we are stupid and we'll see this teaser and Go crazy 🤯over this this and hype the moive what the fuck was that 🤢 so we just have expect that if a moive gets hit then after at you will this type of chopped try hard moives like what was that scene where the girl stab the guy pick and throw them away and the expression she gives 🤢 WTF ?
Tiger is Arjun Kapoor in the making. No talent, same expression and copying every other movie.
Damm jimmy!!! Calm down😮
Bro why Don't you review a teaser of Bengal Files????
Everyone wants to be an animal 😂
Bollywood is living with this herd mentality. Ek genre ki film badhiya chal gayi to bas us genere ko khinchte jao bhed chaal me. Stree 2 aur BB2&BB3 ke baad ab horror comedy filme bhi line se ban rahi hai, Animal ke baad violent action filme bhi line se ban rahi hai aur Saiyaara ke baad musical love stories bhi line se banne lagegi. Kuch bhi creativity aur naye experiments nahi ban rahe hai bollywood me.
The Director A Harsha only did 2 Good Kannada films in his career, Rest are just Cringe films with supernatural elements and family sentimental films. So I don't think this film works.
It’s after jammy’s video I gotta know bhaagi 4 is here🤣
Tiger Shroff- farts offscreen, shits onscreen.
😂This time Tiger Shroff learned how to shout
Your video is too overexposed. please improve the lighting
Baaghi franchise strives to be a pandemic in popularity but ends up being an agent of lockdown for theatres.
It all started with ANIMAL. When a filmmaker with star went on full blood ride after that kill, marco have cemented GORE mainstream cinema . That's what Nadiadwala is trying to copy
Lagta hai makers ko andaaz ho gaya tha ki movie dekhney key baad audience vi yesey hi katai karenge unki😂
Very well said jammy.
I think its spoof teaser of marco and animal.. lets wait for actual teaser. Tiger will roarrrrrrr😑
This felt like badass ravikumar+ animal
After baaghi 3, cov!d came. Now I am scared for baaghi 4😢
Stop coping W vish😂
14 august war 2 29 august param Sundari  19 September jolly llb 3 are going to be my 3 upcoming movies that i have High expectations
Animal+Marco+kill
Animal in 360p 😂. And what is this soundtrack jumpcuts. 1 sec before emotional then thrilling then again some dialogue baazi. What in the oggy and the cockroaches is this 😂😂🤣
When I saw the first look, I thought about giving the Baaghi franchise a chance, this teaser made me rethink my choice.
A good action film with a good storyline and a believable protagonist is all I want to see from Tiger.
This teaser is a glance of if 'kill' and 'Animal' divorced each other
Should’ve made more connected movies instead of spiritual sequels those just breed horrible writing
Bollywood is allergic to having original ideas these days
Petition to cast Jammy in Baaghi 5✊
Do a coolie vs war 2 prediction video and explain how coolie will win
I hope this movie gets as successful as son of sardar 2 😅
I have no  problem in violence   But i do have  problem  with the forced voilence ....
Just curious any cbfc cuts will be there 😂😂😂.  Also if a pathetic movie like housefull 5 earned around 200 crore, if this earns then God help us all
Baaghi4 = Animal x Marco x Hit3 + ( Baaghi series)
Bro took birth to make useless sequels of Baaghi   Will stop after Baaghi 50
I have seen krishna shroff (sister of tiger Shroff)  more than tiger in Last 2 year.. in reality shows.. Yes this is a flex of not seeing bad action movies
First comment 😂
This is the habit of bollywood just to follow a wave now there will be so many love stories like saiyaraa
Bhandup ki animal
Can’t even say unemployment brought me here in 30 seconds because it’s 6:30 in the evening
Second Comment
No views in 43 seconds? Bro fell off 😢😢😢  JK, amazing rant, Jammy.
There was no need for this movie it's high time some actors understand that they need to learn acting to stay relevant
Totally agreed, R., they think we are dumb?
Another movie added to my skip list.
Haha first comment.
