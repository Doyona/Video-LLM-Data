I'm surprised I haven’t come across any comment mentioning Keith's elegant wedding dress complete with the flowers and all! He carried it with such poise and it's just so cute that he did that!
WOOOOOw!
😂😂😂
We all know Keith is a bridezilla 😂😂
Jonny just casually horrifying everyone with Barbie head kinks. Also Eugene and Marissa's bromance in the kitchen has my entire heart.
marissa looks like aubrey plaza in the cover
I love how Eugene went to caring older brother mode with Marissa
Marissa should be more grateful
i hope eugene is okay with women thirsting after him because that man is so hot
marissas hairstyle is SO cute
The SHADE! 😂😂😂 "Today we're ALL wife guys!" 😂😭
“Does that look like cake?” As the mixer is actively SINKING into the bowl
Today we’re all wide guys on no
When keith said they were not allowed back as judges, i was waiting for johnny or rosanna to yell "I'm freeeee!"
23:15 Dude...... I think eugene just turned me gay.
Keith looks so pretty!
Zachs cakr reminds me of a dalek from doctor who 😂😂
I just love that the cake that won the wedding cake competition was the ONE cake that was definitively NOT a wedding cake - agreed by all
35:56 AWWW
I didn't know I needed a bridezilla crashout from Keith... but I did.
all of them helping each other out is the sweetest part of without a recipe
😂😂😂my parents are like Eugene’s 😅
Judges cancelled 😂😂😂
Zack’s cake batter has the best consistency
Can we acknowledge the sheer amount of cleanup the staff had to do?? XD Like seriously after the batter-making part they could've probably renovated the whole place xD
21:03
Eugene helping Marissa not panic and problem solve and strateize alternatives was so sweet. 😭
40:18 why does that remind of the golden plates somehow? 😂
Wow all of the cake looks so special
watching withouth a recipe and seeing the juror give advice immediately followed by one of the try guys fucking it up very badly takes years of my life, i seriously can't watch this
Eugene’s mom brought me to absolutely tears😂 54:23
A year later and I'm still trying to figure out how that happened with Marissa's bowl
I was like "The poison in hydrangeas can't be THAT bad" and then I looked it up. Vomiting, fainting, coma-inducing. Wow I never knew how poisonous one of my favorite flower was.
I love how try guys has grown but I’ll always miss Eugene but for the recent hires I appreciate them too! Edit: I guess I needed Keith’s flooring cake for GL cuz we totally sucked at this Reno proj lmao
Honestly I know Keiths tasted plain, but he should have been given extra props for thinking outside the box with his flavors with the pine.
Also lavender is Zacks color
My first reaction was "OMG hydrangeas are poisonous!"
Me who loves cake 🎂
Zacks opener the zinger
Keith crash outs are my favorite thing 🤣🤣
Dis cake hahahahaha i don’t know why I found that so hilarious
Does Marissa have a baking channel now?
I got emotional when Jonny was judging Marissa. She worked so hard and really wanted to do well. I love when people really try at things and get amazing outcomes.She also looked amazing,could not stop staring at her 😊
"Love doesn't always win,  and go forth tit's out" tattoo that shit on my body
Keith was robbed
Adding coffee absolutely adds a coffee flavor to it. Those of us who hate coffee can absolutely taste it.
49:07  "shh I'm a cold hearted snake" Eugene,  we know how supportive and caring you are.  You rubbed Becky's feet for her at Zach and Maggie's wedding for crying out loud
48:13  I'm literally crying. This is such a wholesome episode!!!!!  😭😭😭
44:01  "Bake like you're singing in the shower"   That was  so wholesome of Johnny
38:05  Johnny being so proud of Zach was so wholesome!
Eugene supporting Marissa was so incredibly wholesome
Eugene giving Marissa a pep talk was so sweet😭
I love to dance and eat wedding cake Eugene! 😂
Before the baking  starts,  you all look amazing
Marissa, was that you as a teacher on the 9-1-1 series, season 2 episode 18?
I love Kieth as bridezilla
The best part of the video is ALWAYS when Keith is placed lmao 🤣
Are they allowed to taste their food? Like I’ve seen a few of these and haven’t heard a rule that says they can’t taste it… but I don’t feel like they ever taste anything 😂
I love how supportive this show is.
I not only get stressed from watching them cook or create sometimes but also just seeing about absolute mess on the counter and the insane amount of dishes to do.
“i wanted her to get away from him but i guess hell just be headless” lmao
Boy. It’s Feb 2025. Life is LIFE-ING and this video is so comforting. Jonny praising Marissa brought me to tears. There is joy and kindness and friendship in this video and it’s a good reminder of how we can be!
That opening was top tier 😂
it upsets me Kieth didn’t do a chocolate banister
How did she win Wedding cakes without a recipe with a divorce cake!? 😂
i miss Eugene so much
Keith won best dressed
43:15 A cake for the HGTV couples!
Keith yelling in the dress 😂
“I’m so sorry you’re cancelled” gets me everytime 🤣
I sometimes think back to how Eugene was in the early days of the Try Guys and he has changed so much! I used to find him really intimidating and seeing him so much more free spirited and comfortable brings me an unexpected amount of joy :')
I lowkey thought Marissa was Aubrey plaza
Dude made a poisonous cake,that a hole other level of screw up
Not the wife guys comment 😭😂
In Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte,  the original Black Forest Cake, you definitely want to put straight liqour (Kirschwasser, a cherry schnaps) right onto the baked cake before assembly! 😊
Zach is basically win wedding cake. Because the 1st place is divorced so 😂
Johnny is so supportive <3
Zach's fit at the judging is amazing - he looks great!
We're all "wife" guys 😂
yall tell me thumbnail aint aubrey plaza
I love Marissa 💕💕
Keith saying "butter makes the batter better honey" and in the immediate next short it appears on a board behind Johny 😂😂😂
14:02 missed opportunity to cut to Keith literally mixing with his hands
so... is Jonny Cakes always like this, or has he developed some kind of survival mechanism to without a recipe that just dismantles all filters?  the barbie doll heads followed 'my mom fkd the history teacher' in one episode is WILD
The “Butter Makes The Batter Better” on the wall after he said it belongs in a mothers kitchen-
Marrisa, if you're looking for a boyfriend, I'm available!
Jonny was so sweet and sentimental for this episode it was so nice to see haha
I feel like they sabotaged Eugene with the poison flowers…. I feel like that could have been a warning from a LOT of people to prevent….. literal poison
I really hope Marisa goes forward with baking and finds passion there
Johnny rlly loves zach huh hahahhahaha
Thats call to Keiths mom , was the most asian mom thing ever 🤣🤣
Zach i love the cake so much i wish I could eat it
I never saw this episode but today I learned Mexican and Asian mom’s love the same type of cake.
I'm so proud of Marissa omg she did so good!
@thejonnycakes I've been to weddings and never experienced the fake ass shit. I'm on you all day and night and you can't escape this comment
let’s all pray min’s next husband doesn’t get beheaded
12:07 give your editor a raise for adding in that sign behind Jonny as a call back to Keith 😂
Minyoung 2028
a lot of tea was spilled during this episode
I want to see Johnny react to their actual cooking
I’ve been divorced twice and I definitely bought a sheet cake for myself from walmart 😂 love Marissa ❤
“3 stairs to be exact” 😭😭😭
Keith is the ultimate dry guy! :D
i kinda really do wanna taste marissa"s cake, it looks so tasty, i don't even like cakes
keith using the tub is actually the funniest thing any try guy has ever done
Marrisa  needs to be on another website.
eugene got ROASTED by his own mom
Marissa is hot as hell in this episode. What in the world 😂
10:38 Dumb Marissa! She might've never used any electronic appliances ever(in the kitchen) . Just ask for help when needed rather than breaking shit .
im actually crying, i love Eugene's mom so much
Kieth’s reaction to getting 4th made me dieeee the judges were not ready for that at all 😂😂
Watching this again a year later and it’s wild to go from a Marissa scene to a commercial starring Marissa. Get it, girl!!
Eugene just proved that he has a heart of gold by helping Marissa as she spiraled out. Despite the way he tries to portray himself, I think long time viewers know he's a big ol' softie at heart.
I know I'm late but I just wanna say Eugene's vision of his mom's cake gives off Tamiko Ridley vibes in Inside Out when she married herself HAHHAHAHAA
I am sorry but I have noticed that Rosanna is always gunning for Keith and shakes her head waiting for the first impression of other judges to follow. I know with Keith is funny is probably planned  but otherwise she follows the real chefs.
“my mom loves sand…” 😂😂
Would totally like to disagre!! Love always wins... divorce is the biggest show of love for yourself and that's the best kind of love! <3 Tits out is a great saying, I totally agree with that! ^_^
54:16 is the most Asian a parent can get 🤣🤣🤣
But it’s not a WEDDING cake???????
Thank you Keith for wearing for the bit but also in the classiest way
OMFG, Eugene’s mom was absolutely brutal! Somebody give this man CPR stat😂😂😂
did anyone else notice jonny had a sign behind him that said “butter makes the batter better honey” right after keith said it 😂❤
The more I watch this, the hotter Marissa gets. Every time.
Eugene really went with the six comparison for his mom.  divorced ,beheaded, died.
They made Marissa cake sound so delicious that make me want to eat it 🤤
People seriously underestimate how many flowers are poisonous to us and other animals. So if you have pets check what plants are safe for them to be around.
Eugene's mother roasted him worse than any judge ever could. Period xD
This is pure chaos 😂
i did not expect these basic flavours
Whoever did a John Williams-esque score to this episode did an amazing job!
KEITH IN A WEDDING DRESS!? HELLO!?
Good job to Eugene !!-He litterally Told Marissa to look at him and made sure she had calmed down and had a back up Plan and being a good friends
11:57 12:04 Keith saying this line tickles a part of my brain
Definitive proof Eugene is a witch. Makes not a wedding cake, nowhere near as good looking in presentation as all his other stuff, cake is dry, and literal poison on most of the cake that they had to avoid, and still wasn’t last.
Sorry just clicked cause of the thumbnail, girls with bewbs name please?
the way eugene's mom roasts him so hard
my mom's friend got divorced and they went out to dinner to celebrate
As soon as Eugene spoke about his mom’s favorite being coffee cake, talking about the cake made for her, all I can think of, “Mommy’s favorite”
I still think Keith's cake was a sculptural beauty.
54:15 im crying eugene’s mom is hilarious
Rosanna saying, "You literally guessed it!" and being so "shocked" just shows how nice of a person she is. It wasn't hard to guess that he made stairs with his description lol 🙃😄
Eugene's batter is giving Matilda and I'm having flashbacks, iykyk
Zacks Cake looks like a Darlek 😅
I really wanted to see their reactions trying the cakes after the judges 😩   GREAT JOB EVERYONE! Love you all
Johnny being Zach’s proud dad this episode made me really happy <3 he’a put up with so much baking related crap from this one in particular that this moment felt full circle
Eugene made a Red Wedding Cake by mistake
Don't have a shit cake
Did you tell Eugene i love him yet
Tell Eugene i love him
Wedding cakes are cool cooked with batter
Eugene’s mom is hilarious
I wished Keith and Zach had worn their selfmade wedding dresses
This is definitely my favorite WAR episode!! I rewatch it almost every other week.
who's gonna tell keith about hand mixers???
"In that dress?!" 😂❤ deseree is a gift
I fell behind on videos and just saw a short from this, but I had to come here to say Keith is no joke wearing the dress I wore to my wedding last summer 🙃😂
Why is Eugene accidentally putting a beautiful yet poisonous plant on a cake so on brand
btw there’s nothing wrong with gmos. your dog is a gmo. almost everything you eat is a gmo
Marissa you can divorce me anytime
Actually so proud of Marissa! She’s always been incredibly talented. Every hidden talent episode she’d do surprisingly well when trying the skills out for the first time.
this made me tear up and laugh out loud in 1 episode HAHA
This is so not relevant but zach's hair is looking Amazing! So messy and THICK!
Try guys try baklava without a recipe!!
I love Keith, I love his cake, I love this episode, but baby that is not a pine tree
facepalmed as soon as i saw the hydrengea. oh well at least there was a no poison tear lol
Eugene went from helping to poisoning to being roasted by his own mother 😂😂😂😂😂 omg I died laughing reacting to that.
I love Eugene's hanbok
Eugene's mom is hilarious!
I never want to dance and I’m in my mid 20s I hate dancing at weddings it’s just weird and people stare at you and ugh I rather sit and eat
Oh how I miss this series
Jonny is truly the highlight of the try guy videos now.  He is an example of one of those humans who make a room lighter.  Love watching him and so glad he is part of the company now.
I got emotional when Johnny talked to her about her cake and his own experiance when he made his devorse-cake
Eugene, taking the time to stop and walk Marissa through an alternative solution to her cake is the only male energy I will be accepting from now on. Helpful, but not condescending. Love it!
Funny about hydrangeas. Although yes they are poisonous. The risk to fully grown adults of relatively low and to get any actual sever effects they would have to eat an entire gardens worth of hydrageas. But it is still not good to eat food touched by a hydragea just incase
Keith is a BrideZilla. I thought 2nd and 3rd place wouldve been switched.
Which episode of without a recipe is it where Keith puts yeast in his cake?
Keith looks ✨ amazing ✨
I want this divorce to prevail 😂
“When life gives you lemons, you make…” video cuts to an ad for Lemonade Pet Insurance, perfect timing and hilarious 😂
i can really see conan's influence on keith and looovvviinggg itttt!!!!!!!
"- illusion cake AND wedding cake-"  the only illusion was Keith hearing someone defending the dryness of his cake 🤣  I love coming back to these videos. I've noticed how often I forget and/or miss so many jokes the first times I watch, the rewatchability 🤌✨👏💝
I cannot express my love-hate relationship with the fact that Zack doesn't give a single crap about the cake batter itself and yet he makes it absolutely perfect???
im so proud of zack!! 😂😂
Keith doing everything that Jonny says won’t work is hilarious 😭😭😭
The “Butter makes the batter better” 11:58 showing up behind Jonny had me deceased. someone give the editors a raise
Eugene putting hydrangeas on the cake {hydrangeas are poisonous to cakes} is Priceless !!! So Freaking Funny’
just realized marissa was in an episode of lucifer! 😂😂😂 s5 e6! 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨❤️
Jonny being so proud of Zach for improving so much makes my heart melt
I loved this series so much! <3 thank you everyone who made this happen ^^
why are the judges always so unnecceserily hard on zach
the salt with Keith, that's one angry bride
The phone call to eugenes mom was so damn funny
Me looking at Zach's wedding cake whilst also rewatching/catching up on Doctor Who: "It looks like a Dalek! EXTERMINATE!"
Eugene demonstrated how to help someone spiraling with anxiety. Telling us to calm down or that it isn’t that bad isn’t going to help. We can’t just calm down, and even if it isn’t a big deal, it FEELS like a disaster. Eugene’s solution is much better: This sucks, but what you’re doing isn’t helping. Here’s some practical solutions to your problem that you can use for a backup option
Eugene and Marissa had a top chef moment
Justice for Zach he should have won by default if marrisa's wasn't a wedding cake
I just watched Eugene and his mom rank fruits, and Mr. Cho was in it (her late husbans), made me sad :(
Wow, i didn't reallose how sexy miranda was until this video. 😍😍
The try guys make cocktails without a recipe
For next season im hoping for ice cream sandwiches
SIX THE MUSICAL MENTIONED ?!
Omg Zack made a Dalek 😂😂😂. Someone call the doctor!
I read the comments that 2 tiers of Eugene’s are poisonous, I thought it was gonna be the amount of cocoa in there!!
Did anyone notice the glass spilling at 44:35? 😂
eugene's mom is adorable :)
Keith's mom is so Asian, my mother  would have done the same. This was the most heartwarming epidode.
I love Eugene so much.
Without a recipe
Marissa did a good job!! The shout out to Eugene was sweet :)
Keith totally should have called his cake, “The Next Step” 😂
I saw Marissa on 9-1-1
Okay, I love this series, HOWEVER, could you PLEASE teach new bakers how to use their baking tools and machines properly??? That was so scary watching her with the mixer and not making sure the bowl was secured before she turned it on. People can get seriously hurt when they don't know what they're doing.
Zach: Today we are all wife guys😂😂😂😂 DEAD!!!
Eugene real talking her with experience in these games 😂
Eugene’s mom giving him shade was so funny!😂😂54:16
Today we’re all wife guys 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is my 3rd time watching this and I'm just noticing how they glazed over Jonny knocking over his champagne glass when giving Keith his cake to try 😂
The "marissas frosting" in bubble letters on her container of frosting is so cute
WHY ARE THEY MIXING SHIT WITH THEIR LITERAL HANDS SKIN 😂😂😂😂😅 22:44
omg im so happy to see how far the try guys have improved in terms of baking!!! this was such a huge leap from their first cake ep ❤
Keith took the mixing by hand a little too literal….
I love Eugene calling his mom 😂 “I regret calling you” lolll
24:34 the true crumb coat
32:29 Jonny some things are outside thoughts to and some are inside thoughts. That was an inside thought.
.
felt so stressed
I love Keith when he became the last  he always go bananas 😂😂😂
Kieth said “ sound like something in a moms kitchen, Butter makes the batter better honey” then Johnny’s background says the same things 🤣 I can’t
I got married at 23 (hubby was 29) we celebrate or 30th Anniversary this year in June!
Why is no one talkin bout how precious keith luks in the dresssssd🖤😭
I think my favorite part is when they have the actual bakers saying something vitle about making a cake, and it cuts to one the of them doing the exact opposite of what they've just said.
I usually root for Eugene but I feel like Keith getting 4th when two of eugene's tiers were inedible was rough...
I love marissa
Also putting an unsafe ingredient should be automatic last place. Seriously. That’s not good.
i live johnny and ro being bride and groom
Keith shouting in his flowy wedding dress was a sight to behold.
Jonny is the best guest on this channel prove me wrong 😡😂❤
Johnathan Cakes 😂
LOVE DOESN'T ALWAYS WIN AND GO FORTH, TITS OUT  Please give us the t-shirt, Guys
I love the whole sequence where Eugene got Marissa to just stop and breathe for a moment and then proceded to help her make a backup plan when her jelly failed to set in time.  Also, y'know, I know and appreciate that it's without a recipie, but it FEELS like someone should have told them not to use these specific flowers because it'll... I don't know, POISON the CAKE?
what I really love about WAR is that the guys always help each other out, theres no unhealthy competition. They do want to win, but the also want to see others win, very wholesome.
Marrissa fucking sucks, why is she so fake and staged the entire time. 10/10 did not enjoy watching her, the guys are all still awesome tho
“ my mom has a really dry sense of humor.” Lmfao
30:50 - I did not see that coming. Damn Eugene indirectly  trying to poison the judges😅😅
when Eugene UPTURNED the cocoa powder into his bowl I had an aneurysm 😂
The fact a divorce cake one on a wedding cake episode is wild
the first video i’ve never seen the judges spit out the food
I’m obsessed with Marissa
Keith took “mixing by hand” so literally I cannot
Omg Zach! Not in the shade intro 😂😂
Watch this more than once. This is my favorite WAR now
The one female judge was judgmental in a non funny way :/  This is supposed to be funny, why she so serious
Eugene's so wonderful to Marissa throughout and helped her feel better or do better when she needed it. What a friend. ❤
I ❤️ Keith's bridezila moment
Man keith's gonna feel like a real dickhead when he finds out he was completely wrong about what he thougth people said about his cake, rendering his rant completly pointless. XP
I already liked Marissa but this show really made me fall in love with her. Yes homo.
can we appreciate how, at 39:36, in the transition between Zach and Keith's judging, the clip was a lesbian couple?! 🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈❤🧡🤍💗💓
51:34 it’s like keith was attempting to get them to rank Eugene down to last place 😂😂
Go forth tits out is so funny.
i didn’t think i could get gayer but melissa in her LBD 😱…
“Today we are all wife guys” was epic
Eugenes idea made me cry. That is so sweet of him to do a mom loves herself cake. I love my mom so much, i think i will bake her a mom loves herself cake, she has been dealing with some stuff lately so i feel like some cake would be lovely.
Ro looks stunningly gorgeous!
This video is like a car wreck you can’t look away. I can’t honestly say it’s 56:47 of my life I’ll never get back 😵‍💫
Zach's opening wife guy joke kinda killed
Here waiting for Marissa to open up her own business
I love the irony in the divorce cake winning the wedding cake contest
hearing Jonny praise Marissa so genuinely, passionately, and thoroughly on her cake healed something in me, i literally cried tears down my face
Off the rack
OMFG TODAY WE’RE ALL WIFE GUYS
Keith really went full bridezilla
Anyone notice Jonny knock over a full glass of champagne at 44:33? 😂
fully thought Marissa was Aubrey Plaza in the thumbnail 💀
My favorite part of all these Without a Recipe is when who knows how to do the thing, would say "and by any means, DONT DO THIS" and its cut to a clip of one of the guys doing exactly that
GET GARRET WATTS ON WITHOUT A RECIPE!
Love it for marrissa
Eugene's mom is a mood
Keith was such a bridezilla at the end
“Keith and zachs parents are still together 🙄🤷🏻‍♀️” hahahaha
Finally watched this, and it was so incredibly sweet and wholesome hearing Jonny say Marissa has a talent and could have a future in baking and telling her how he was told that too.  ❤😢
For next session y’all should try without a recipe funnel cake! I think it would be an interesting endeavor
4:32 I’m 34 and definitely am eating the cake lol
They so should have called it “The Try Kitchen”
Love Eugene stopping her freak out and refocusing her to calm down.
Honestly I would've put Eugene last 🙊 his cake was poisoned
evil eugene and good eugene may be gone, but sweet eugene is in full force
@12:06 Keith's phrase "butter makes the batter better honey" edited in the background lol
Marissa is by far the best addition to without a recipe out of any of the more recent contestants theyve brought on.
Even though it was acting, Keith’s outburst was so offputting and uncomfortable
I love the way directly after Keith says "butter makes the batter better honey" and says he’s sure that that quote is hanging somewhere in a mom’s kitchen it cuts to Johnny and there’s a sign that has that exact quote on it in the background😂
I'm so glad I'm bisexual to admire the person and being that is Marissa.
“I did make a good cake on that show that no one watched.” - Eugene 😂😂😂😂😂
Keith: gets fourth  Keith: “Bridezilla mode”
I fear for the judges safety when they this cakes my poor Rosanna  ❤
Marissa should be the 4th try guy lol
Min is my favorite part of this episode!
angry bride keith is my favorite person 😂
the “wife guys” statement killed me 😂
Anyone else find it just unbelievably creative that Keith made a pine simple syrup?
Without a recipe cereal!
Keith's concoction at @14:47 reminds me of what the little girl makes Oliver in "Oliver and Company"😅
They shouldve had sarah schauer for a judge bc she loves divorce 😂😂
When the Hydrangea appear at 29:33 on Eugene's cake... I already worried 😢
I love Marisa working her pain out through awesome cake!
Keith and his bridezilla moment. 😂
Keith was great!!! Can’t stop laughing.
The vat is KILLING me
Technically Eugene made a "Mommy's Favorite Wedding Cake"
Eugene's mom is the representative of the ultimate Asian mom. haha
Keith called a florist and got a floorist
Jonny dont say that 😂 I'm gonna make my own wedding cake 😂😂
What happened with Marissas mixer? How did it break I feel like I mixed something
My parents divorce was finalized on May 4th. My mom celebrates and calls it Independence Day
This is an all time great episode. I love this triumph for Marissa
I thought Marissa was Aubrey Plaza in the thumb nail.
I'm having an absolutely horrible day, but this is making it so much better
It looks like a disco Dalek..."Officiate! Officiate!" Love it.❤
Johnny is such a cute hype man for the try guys, i love seeing him in without a recipe and any videos!
Omg I legit shrieked when Eugene dumped in the rest of the cocoa powder 😂😂😂
I'm going to taste the coffee. I'm a super bitter taster and it sucks. Y'all ruin chocolate cakes for me with this "trick".
Hydrangeas actually contain cyanide so would have been pretty dangerous to consume the cake 😅
I JUST WATCHED THE EPISODE OF 911 WITH MARISSA OMG
I think Marissa made the best thing in the entire series. That cake is gorgeous
Johnny being so excited to feed Keith that he knocked over the champagne is honestly iconic
Keith is such a bridezilla
The look on their faces when he mentioned his mom’s divorce was priceless 😂😂😂😂😂😂
love Eugene's call to his mom
Keith gaslighting himself 😭
has zack gotten taller???
Eugene accidentally making the cake poisonous is so... Evil Eugene 🤣
All I heard was Tati- “More is more” lol FYK YK
I’m getting married in two months  and just decided on the flavors of my cake, so when Eugene said raspberry vanilla I fell off my seat 😂 👀👀👀👀 I guess I’m basic
"There's nothing more basic b*tch than a heterosexual wedding."   It can't be funny if it doesn't make sense.
Eugene's mum is SAVAGE!!! But like you can tell she isn't trying to be. 😂
Marissa and Eugene's little sister older brother energy!
Marissa is everyone's little sister. It also makes the rivalry between her and Zach so much funnier, cause he's the second oldest sibling who used to be the baby of the group.
Eugene was honestly so awesome and supportive 😭
49:03 The BEST PART! Oh man that history teacher is in trouble with his son in law! 🤣
The Try Guys are SO BAD at making cakes, that their GUEST COMPETITOR wan against them in their first try! BRRUUHHH
Johnny is surprisingly my favorite member of the try guys universe
I love that in the beginning of the episode Eugene made the joke that his mom’s love life was like the musical “Six” because she divorced one husband and the other one died, and then when he accidentally beheaded the groom figurine, it truly became a “Six” themed cake. Divorced, beheaded, died lmaooooo
Keith living in his bridezilla era😂😂
Y'all are such a good distraction from the stresses of life 🙌
Marissa's divorce jokes had me
This is why I still love Eugene.. so much
eugene’s mom had me cracking up PLEASE
Knowing Zach’s previous experiences making cake…it’s nice to hear the outcome for this episode.
Eugene's mom really said, "Leave the baking to the pros. You're a good eater." And I love her for that because I am also a terrible baker but a good eater.
Good God Keith is a BRIDEZILLA! 1🤣 What a fun season 😆
7:47 the doves were deadass going “guys get it together, we’re on!” “Tighten in, come on kinda OW you stepped on my foot!” “Guys pull it together, this is our moment!”
tell me why johnny telling marissa how talented she is literally made me tear up
Eugene helping Marisa is everything to me.
I love Keith and his cake but the hate rant bit is dead. Kill that bit please?
Eugene being so sweet and helping Marissa was really heart warming ahhhh <3 🥺
The further we go along and the more Jonny is in videos the more I am convinced he is a perfect try guy feature.
Using the Keith’s next step idea for my wedding in 6-10 year
SOOOOOOOOO HAPPY FOR MARISSA OMG GOOD JOB GIRL!
"To make a SHIT LOAD of CAKE!" OMG, I died! Lmao 😭😭
ZACHARY KORNFELD. No you did not. 💀
MARISSA I'M SO PROUD OF YOU I LOVE YOU
I never cried of laughter and cried of emotion this much in my life
Its funny how this is a wedding cake contest but somehow the divorce won
I want a Jonny reacts to them baking these cakes, I feel like his cringe and comments would be top tier
"it's best to hand mix" Keith: say less fam
I'm so proud of Zach too!
As a home baker myself, these baking videos are horrifying to watch, but I just can’t look away 🫣
So Marrisa is getting her own cooking show right?
Me, wondering if Eugene's mom liked coffee cake or coffee flavored cake lol
Keith should of just made a 3 layer cake and just carve the stairs 😂
“How many eggs, Keith?” “Idk, 12?”   Clearly we didn’t learn from the first WAR cakes 11:21
Is it me or Keith's cake looks like a big tamal oaxaqueño 😂
I like it when the camera kind of zooms out and focuses on what they’re doing so you know it’s wrong
I think the cake is the best part of ANYTHING !!! :D Im 36 XD Always thought that... xD
This was such a funny and great  episode
Okay Eugene helping Marissa was the sweetest moment ever. Like how he just look at her and was like hey it’s okay there’s a solution you’re gonna be okay. He’s so lovely
Stirring the unset jelly with your hand Is crazy!
I just love Marissa so much. I love how genuine she is with her expressions and you can tell how much Johnny’s comment meant to her plus that cake was bad ass.🖤🫀
I think I’m finally done watching these because Keith’s outbursts literally are not funny to me at all and just give me flash backs to my father. And watching people be too uncomfortable to speak to him is just uncomfortable to watch. It makes it so much less fun.
marissa looks so good I'm losing my mind.
This episode really had everything. 😂 Johnny's awkward moments were top tier and somehow still outmatched by Keith's meltdown and Eugene's mom's call
I love when Keith goes crazy when they tell the results 😂
The fact that Eugene’s cake would kill the guest and he still didnt get last place is crazy 😭
So the non wedding cake wins- that’s just disappointing
Keith having a bridezilla moment is so hilarious and (WARsona) in-character
Johnny is so precious, sweet and wholesome. Love that guy
she’s funny wit her divorce jokes 😭😭
This is probably my favorite episode ever.
Wheres the live finale? 👀 i feel like we never got the proper ending to this season of WAR....
Marissa has confirmed my bisexuality. Congratulations girl, you've earned it! 🍾👏🏾👏🏾
Typical Asian Parent
Eugene you’re so good with being under pressure & so nice to your piers 😢❤ what a beautiful moment to have witnessed when you pep talked Marissa 😭🤧🫶🏼❤️
Keith is going crazy when he gets 4th. Absolutely made me cry of laughter. I almost peed myself lmfao.
Eugene lovin and supporting Marissa Johnny building up and bolstering Zach  100/10
Eugene’s mom is the true vip.
I say this every season, Rosanna looks gorgeous! ❤ her dark hair especially is stunning!
I love how Eugene helped Marissa!!!
Instead of Pine, Keith could have just used some Gin 🤔
Keith standing there in that oddly well fitting dress confuses me in the best way haha
They addressed the poison but not the glass shrapnel?
Love Eugene's outfit!!!
my toxic trait is thinking i could do this AND banter with eugene. pls let me try😭
Bridezilla Keith is everything honestly
I haven't been watching Try Guys for a while, but this video made me smile ❤  I'm guessing the judges don't take points away for if the cake doesn't meet theme criteria? I thought they used to take that into consideration? Regardless, her cake was sooo awesome! Well deserved, especially taking into account its made without a recipe! 👏🏼
Tits out indeed
Johnny adds such a great aspect to the show. Idk why but it adds some really great goofy moments, and I’m glad he’s part of it :)
Please 🙏 please do chocolate making without a recipe next!!! PLEASE!!!! 😂 Give them one cheat , which would be cocoa bean fermenting and crushing the nibs.
MARRISSA IS PUERTO RICAN?! WHHHHOOOOOO BORICA QUEEEEEEN
I really love Eugene. 🥰
ah yes, because a dry cake is worse than LITERAL POISON
“Hey, you’re not invited next season” OMGGGG 😂😂😂😂
Is that Chandler? 😭💔
I would like everyone to know that pine is poisonous so not only is Eugene’s cake poisonous but Keith’s is as well
I absolutely love Eugene’s mom, like I love every word she said, so adorable!
Is it just me or does Zach’s cake kinda look like a Dalek 🤨🤨
I love that during Zach's judging you can see in Jonny's face he gets annoyed at the othwr judges for just a second when they start talking about the density of Zach's cake. You can see his inner monologue is "Who cares if its dense? Its Edible, its cake, AND IT TASTES GOOD??" The man has gone through so much at Zach's hands specifically, he deserved to enjoy some cake for once!! 😂😂
That’s right desire !!😂
I wish Keith had more time to decorate his with gold railing some how !
OMG Keith is a drama bride!!
Zach saying, "Jonathan Cakes" sent me, also Jonny was such a wholesome guest judge this season. We stan pappa cakes.
Ro has the crispiest Rs I've ever heard
suggestions for next season: Scones Shortbread English Muffins Truffles A chocolate bar
I was not expecting bridezilla Keith
It always kills me when Zach calls Jonny Jonathan. Plus, Marissa's zings are just top-tier (pun intended)!
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT GLASS KITCHEN BOWL COSTS!!!!!????
Why would I pay for cable when they exist
"The driest of driest cakes" had me 😂
Interestingly the frosting this was pre made. Lord bless the frosting maker for that.
i love it when jonny literally just says things, so out of pocket for absolutely no reason and im always here for it
I am so happy I am 🪨d watching this 😂😂😂
Love these videos.. but the lack of gloves makes me feel uneasy 😅
I got so excited when Johnny was the professional in the kitchen even if his name has cakes in it and he's just the sweetest thing in the world.
jonny is the funniest person in the entire world. he's so EFFORTLESSLY *CHAOTIC*, i love the energy
Keith looks very innocent 🥺
wish try guys were familiar with twitch streamers purely because i wish QTCinderella was here to judge everyones wedding cakes
Love doesn't always win. Go forth, tits out! 🖤💔🖤💔🖤
I'm OBSESSED with how Marissa is channeling sexy Jamie Lee Curtis from True Lies 💄🔥   -- if you don't know what I'm referring to, you are sorely missing out on SO much ....... also, it was soooo sweet how Marissa thanked Eugene at the end, made me tear up !!
Jealous. Keith pisses me off…He looks too good in that dress.
Idk if this would be too chaotic but you know how in some cooking shows the judges get to watch and comment. I want their reaction to Keith using a tub 😂😂
*keiths veiny ass hands clutching a single flower in the background*
i love the way johnny didn't stop flirting with zach
Yo, you guys probably won't see this, but I've been silently watching Try Guys since just after you guys left Buzzfeed, and I just wanted to say that over time I've noticed Zach become a more and more confident person as time has gone on. He really seems like he's slowly become more confident and authentic to himself, not to say he wasn't in the past, just more so now. Thought I'd share that.
I love that Eugene could literally poison his cake and still not get 4th place
Today were all “wife” guys👏🏼👏🏼😭😭😭
after Marissa first fucked up Eugene became such a hype man , what a doll 🥲
This was my favorite episode of any season. So good!
They really should have removed the comment by Johnny about the doll heads. Someone is going to do that and end up in the hospital or worse.
I had not watched an hour long YouTube video in years!!!!!!! Loved thiiissss
I really wish we could see the judges reactions to these videos 😂
it seems so out of pocket that maggie was wild at her wedding when she's always so tame in her videos.
The “butter makes the batter better honey” sign being added into the background w Jonny was 🤌🏻💋
Also, Ro in that dress! That dress is STUNNING!!!!!
Keith living in his own world!  The played it back and he was WRONG! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You guys are always so funny!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Keith’s face when his place was announced absolutely killed me 😂 the transition of facial expressions made me laugh for so long I had to pause the video
why didn’t anyone tell eugene about the hydrangeas when he asked for them or before he put them on the cakes 😭😭😭
Jonny saying “flower juice is the least of your worries” is so real and then getting embarrassed about barbie heads was so funny i love him
≤3
haha l love Jonny lol so funny
I just watched Lucifer season 5 and Marissa is in it!!
I love Marissa!
I've said it before but I'll say it again .. Johnny is like the baking version of Garrett Watts. I would love.tonsee a calab with them
I laughed so much this episode with Jonny saying the most out of pocket things 🤣
I do disco cake …
Rosanna looks so friggin gorgeous!! <3
wish it was kwesi instead of marissa
I love how Johnny gives grade not only how good or bad it is but actually saying it in comparison to other things bakers done in the past. I think it’s kinda motivating if you bad in such stuff especially 😅
this episode is so hillarious🤣🤣🤣
Is anyone else annoyed at the woman cutting the slices. Is she just bad at it? I wanted to see Rosanna and Jonny try their hand at cutting cakes.
The reason Keith had no pine flavor in his cake is that plant....not a pine. Looks a cypress of some kind? Hard to tell what it is, probably not poisonous but no needles for flavor. And actually a lot of pine flavored things use resin, or like the young tips of spruce for alcohol flavoring.
I thought he said today we are all white guys lol
A show where Johnny teaches Marissa how to bake please please please
rosanna looks absolutely gorgeous in that wedding outfit 👌🏾
Eugene poisoned 2/3 of his cake and still didn’t get last place 😭
Loveeee i love her!!! I hope she makes a return next season
Im not watching all that. Here's the best part. 55:44
“A shit load of cake” caught me SO off guard 🤣🤣🤣
I'd love to see try guys do colour analysis!!
I love that this is, I think, Merissa's 2nd time on without a recipe, and she already won 1st place
Zach coming in 2nd is basically him winning. He’s come so far, I’m very proud of him 😊
Try guys make crystal candy without a recipe
Keith became a bridezilla, I _live_ for his outrage!
Eugene and Jonny 😂😂😂
By far my favorite part of WAR is "expert: says a thing. Cut to them doing the exact opposite thing"
Zach's cake was built for Beyonce's renaissance world tour
I definitely want a stair cake for my wedding now
Aww, thank you Eugene for helping with Merissa's cake. It made me smile to see you care more about helping her than winning.
This is why glass mixing bowls are a bad idea 😅
So proud of Marissa!
You know I do think without a recipe would be really good with experience cooks, because so many of them still rely on recipes and thermometers. What if that just wasn't accessible and they had to wing it on the spot? I don't watch that many cooking shows so hopefully this one isn't taken
Eugene is really a good person
Who would be dumb enough to divorce Marissa….😑  We love raunchy Johnny:)
7:16 going off of SIX : The Musical, We got divorced, died and the cake covered beheaded. Eugene's a genius
Johnny Cakes is a national treasure
Maaaaan, I love watching Marissa at try guys!! This makes me want to watch more episodes with her. So much fuuun
zach your cake is a Renaissance World Tour Cake
MORE MARISA
i love marissa i hope we see more of her
Eugene showing extreme Capricorn energy by being a logical leader during an emergency aka Marissa panicking ❤😂🎉
It was all their Special Days, and Keith was their Bridezilla.
divorced: Eugene's parents beheaded: Eugene's cake topper died: Eugene's stepfather divorced: Marissa beheaded: Marissa's bowl survived: all of the judges, miraculously
Marissa your reference to Princess Diana's revenge dress is STUNNING!
i like/love Ro. but i feel like she is over doing it a bit this season, i know its her personality but maybe its just me. again i love her but im ready for another judge.
55:03
The second i saw those flowers i was like "arent they poisonous?" But then i thought they're probably fake. They were not. And they were poisonous.
Marissa's cake reminded me of all those evil Eugene recipes, and i knew instantly who the winner was 😂😂
I'm gonna be the one who says it; Keith looked way too good in this fit, specially with the headpiece.
As SOON as he heard glass shattering he yelled "no no put your hands up" Her safety came FIRST Then saying what they should do And then comforting her with a small high five and telling her its okay Great damage control !
The cheapest Eugene recipe this season:
I feel like we’re all a bit too chill about the poison??? How tf did that happen, who let that go through???
😢I eat the wedding cake 😂
We Stan Desiree!! 😂
Does anyone know where the lamps above the jury are from?
35:15 dis cake is so funny 😭😭😭😭
When it said "Zach is 100% correct", my husband said: "It's alright, he still has time [to muck it up]" :'D
Why does Zach's cake look like a Dalek? 😂
This might be my favourite episode ever ❤
I had hydrangeas on mine.. news to me lmao.
Keith's judging look was great.  They all rocked it but seriously, go Keith! A great look and it is a wedding cake.
ngl id eat pinesol flavor icing it smells so good
Eugene eating Keith’s rose out of his hand made me cackleee
Aw, Eugene is so adorable.
I love how Rosannas hair ornament falls off because she's shaking her head saying "dry,  dry, dry, dry"
Omg Keith 4yh place reaction LOL
The fact that in every episode Johnny managed to find  ways to compliment and encourage everyone was just too sweet <3
Keith being a bridezilla 😂  I love Eugene's mom lmao
Remember, love doesn't always win. Go forth tits out.
I would still eat a wedding cake if it got bitten into tbh
I havent watched in years I come back and its to the biggest shade ive ever seen
Love doesnt always win & go forth tits out 🥰🫡
I LOVE Jonny!!!
A divorce cake won the wedding cake episode 😂. Nothing more Try Guys than that!
Haha - I was about to say I love wedding cake - then Eugene said it’s for people over 50….and…. guilty!
I am SO HAPPY Marissa won this episode
I love Jonny so much! He's so talented and so nice and funny and lovely. I'm a big fan and so happy he's a part of this channel now.
WOW THAT CAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Today we're all wife guys" OOP
23:12 i missed you Eugene
I love these random kinky fun facts, and jokes throughout this season! Will the Try Guys be making a kink series in the future? 😂 @johnnycakes ❤❤
I cannot how when Jonny says how much to put Keith and Eugene is doing the exact opposite
Keiths mental breakdown over 4th place bout made me pee
36:35 THE WAY HE SAID IT HES LIKE JOHNNY PLZ NOOOOO 😭
Okay Eugene’s cake might be a little dry but one of the times they made cake he used twelve eggs 😂 it’s a win in my book 😂
i know its a small thing but honestly, seeing them use clips from a lesbian wedding made me so damn happy, i just yelled out to myself when i saw it. warms my heart
"Butter makes the batter better honey" showing up IMMEDIATELY in Johnny's kitchen killed me! 😂
I love the chemistry Marissa brings into the group, I really hope she will be in more episodes
Marissa looks like a hot blend of Lady Gaga and Elizabeth Gillies (Jade from Victorious) and I am a simp for her. She is this bisexual's dream.
why is keith’s cake blurred out at 27:03 😭
Eugene's mom is so cute
Claire Saffitz mention omg. Claire Saffitz Try Guys collab when?
So I’m having Christmas with the family and I just had this thought - WITHOUT A RECIPE: TAMALES!!!
why was keith’s cake blurred 27:03
How come their fondant all look....like...the same... all...good. and Eugene's came out of a bag. Did they not make their own fondant ??
Jonny is by far the most funny person in the try guys universe and I genuinely believe we would be friends
I love how they keep subtly mentioning the show that no one really supported 😭😭😭
“Today we’re all wife guys” my jaw dropped lol
Keith’s design could be taught in culinary schools omg
Uhhhh
judges say something and eugene immediately goes 'my mom loves that'
"Love doesn't always win. Go forth, tits out"
nevermind what the cakes look like, have you seen that final look of Marissa?! 😍😍
You guys should try making mochi!!!!
❤
Desiree was like IN THAT DRESS!? to Keith was the cutest and funniest thing ever
What video is this from
"Nothing more basic b**ch than a heterosexual wedding" 💀
I was waiting for a certain musical reference from Eugene with the divorce cake 😂
My toxic trait is thinking i could do this 💀
I love the progression from scene to scene of Johnny knocking over his glass, the napkin poorly hiding the spill, and then the giving up on the table cloth all together and just removing it 😂
Keith going full bridezilla dhshsjsd
Lol what is Marissa doing on Lucifer! Lol currently watching the rave episode in the background while watching this episode 🎉
Zachs darlek looking ass cake 😭 lmao
Why did they bann the barbie and dog EVRY lego and Playmobil is a chocking hazard just put a warning age 9plus or something gee bring g them back 😭
The Try Guys try therapy...featuring Eugene.
I've been putting off this episode for a bad day and I had a really bad ER shift yesterday and was just so down. I'm just happy to be able to have a laugh in the middle of everything else I'm currently feeling, thanks Try Guys
Johnny's pure fear during Zach's introduction absolutely kills me. That man has lived through Things. Edit: and his surprise when he got an actual cake??? his pride??? lmao I love johnny
I wonder how chaotic it would be to have a Without a Recipe x Phoning It In special? Instead of the chefs phoning in, it'll be the guys? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ngl Zach's cake reminds me of *ahem* Ned's cake
I feel like they should’ve shamed Keith being wrong about who said that his cake wasn’t as dry as Eugene WAY HARDER🤭🤭 he can keep getting away with this lol
Keith made me laugh with tears 💀😭😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀
I feel so much more comfortable knowing the peasants off camera are masked.
Eugene calling his mom gave me nostalgia calling my grandma😂
I am so glad Marissa and Eugene did not get hurt from the glass. That's a terrifying situation to be in
I doubt they will see this but Rachel and the Try Staff are soooo talented at editing and creating the story for us. This is so much better then most cooking shows on TV
I'm kinda of amazed that Eugene's poison cake didn't come in fourth 😂
Zach: "Nothing more basic b*tch than a heterosexual wedding." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. That took me out.
lol Eugene’s mom’s is savage in the most funny loving way possible 😂
Keith’s so earnest when he’s getting good critiques. He just wants to do good.
Jonny should do a series where he makes the try guys cakes but better
52:55
Anyone else see Johnny knock over the glass of Champagne? 😂
Have to give props to the editor that edited in the "Butter makes the batter better honey" sign behind Jonny in the clip after Keith says that that sounds like something a mom would have in her kitchen. 🤌🏻
PLEASE KEEP MARISSA ON THE SHOW!!! we love her
This video seems different, at some point i felt like i was watching a movie especially when Eugene gave some advice to Marissa
Saw so much growth from Zach in this episode but lord that’s a butt ugly cake
omg, “you don’t have much talent for cooking, but you have great talent for eating” is absolutely brutal 😂 probably would’ve made me cry lol
I think this was my favorite without a recipe you guys have done lol
Why does the crew keep wearing masks? I haven’t had to wear a mask at work for a year and I work with customers
Keith going full bridezilla is comedy gold 🤣
My mom got my dad a "Happy Divorce Day" cake, so I approve the sentiment 😂
I've never cried after watching a without a recipe episode but this??!!! Marissa winning for the divorce cake??? And Jonny's sweetest compliments??? Made me tear up 🥹❤️ Oh I'm so happy for her!!!!
Eugene put actual poisons on his cake and STILL didn’t get last place XD
Beautiful cakes, beautiful outfits🥰💕!!!
0:27 the gasp i gasped lmaoooooooooo🤣
Johnny so unfiltered and i love it! 😂😂🎉
Keith is a slay in that wedding dress
Eugene’s convo with his mom sent me over the edge. More of this. Loved this episode!!!!
His rant at the end is cracking me uuuuuppppp😂
MAKE LASAGNA WITHOUT A RECIPE
Eugene is so nice
The single best moment of this video was Eugene biting the flower out of Keith's hand, Keith yelling, "My flower!" and Zach saying, "Careful, that's poisonous." 😂
Before seeing Marissa's judging, I was going to say that you shouldn't make her (ask her) to do any more of these because it was a lot for her and it wasn't that fun seeing her freak out. But then she won and was so happy so I imagine that you will have her in future episodes. Also, I enjoyed Keith's creativity and aesthetic even if the cake was dry. He was focused on structural integrity too. Always a pleasure to watch.Actually, more pine syrup would have helped the cake feel more moist and taste more pine-y.
Marissa has been on the show a few times, I had no idea she had tits of such excellent quality
I'm shocked that Keith didn't make a hamburger wedding cake or something like that.
Lmaoooo I’m dying at Keith’s placement moment
We love good Eugene saving the day!!
Keith is literally wearing the same dress as my wedding dress. I don't know how I feel about this lol.
I kept repeating Zach telling Marissa she's not invited next season. Hilarious af.
Eugene's mom totally roasted him even when he had good intentions and dedicated the episode to her..😂😂😂😂
Was this a Eugene special because of the absence? He was SO inspired! And the mom call was the cherry on top 😂😂😂
How did Eugene still mix his batter for an ungodly amount of time and still not get last again 😂😂
i loved seeing marissa on the show i hope she comes back for more seasons!
Straight squidging is fav line from today 😂😂😂 Zach is such a good friend
Eugene’s mom is such a savage 😂  Also so happy Marissa won, she was awesome
Keith rant in that dress is hilarious
I love how Eugene's mom roasted him whilst sounding sweet.
Better wife guys than the faux wife guy.
I know it’s bad but Keith getting fourth place is my favorite scenario him being so annoyed and angry is the funniest
Mama Yang: Well you’re not that good (in her JYP voice) 😂😂
... ... Marissa... *sits down*... wow...
Marissa is such a great addition to without a recipe! She gives the show a new life!
My jaw hit the floor when i saw rosanna. Shes so beautiful.
I would do anything for Jonny Cakes to come to any of my events and praise my work.
0:28 omg literally cheered for this joke 🤣🤣 get 'em Zach!!
Can yall PLEASE make some "Butter makes the batter better honey" merch?? 😂 I WILL buy some!!
Ive been waiting for keiths meltdown and it finally happened 😂😂 51:35
I think Eugene should have gotten 4th place cause he did technically poison his cake
I really love Johnny encouraging Marissa to explore this skill more, and  Eugene gently but firmly supporting her in the kitchen. Wholesome stuff
is no one gonna mention how great Keith looked in that dress?
well Keith, if you didn't know   Betty bought a bit of butter that made her better bitter so she thought if she bought a bit of butter better than her bitter butter it would make her batter better. so she bought a bit of butter better than her bitter butter and it made her batter better
Keith handled it real well hahaha
no one's gonna say anything about the champagne spill huh
Is that Jim and Pam on top of Keith’s cake??
Oof, Johnny Cakes mom's divorce story is like Mia Thermopolis's! (Except I think her parents had been divorced for a while.)
As much as I'm always rooting for Keith, I just love his freakouts when he gets last place
Sad I missed the live
Loved Marissa in the episode, the cake was so cool
Why Keith looks so good in that wedding dress?! I swear in all the videos I have seen (which are a loooot) this is my favourite outfit for him!? How!? Why!? And also Keith, consider now that you have change you whole wardrobe with exclusivity wedding dresses?!
I hope Eugene's mom wanted espresso cake and not cinnamon coffee cake!
Marissa and Jonny are so great, they both have me laughing the entire time
Eugene really nailed the SiX vibes. Divorced, Beheaded, Died
no one talking about how zach’s cake looks so much like a dalek from doctor who 😂
I refuse to believe that Jonny doesn't have a queue of gay men waiting for him to say yes🤯 he is absolutely handsome, funny yet charming and he has those mysterious chaos seduction elements 😭😭😭 You are my gay legend Jonny 💜
I think Eugene’s mom needs to be on more try guy episodes
I have learnt so much from all the without a recipe episodes. I know what NOT to do and i think one day when I attempt to bake I'll remember all the steps😂 Also I'm so proud of Zach ❤he has come so far.😂😂
I love the try guys so much everyone is such a vibe and everyone is so funny and unique and the judges are also my favs. These episodes always put a smile on my face and never fail to make me laugh😂 ALSO shout out to the editors for the incredible work.❤❤
Heyyyyy I eat wedding cake, as a picky eater and a Greek introvert  that HATES Greek wedding music it's the only part of the reception that I enjoy
I just love Marissa!
I’m so happy you assed the butter makes the batter better honey sign to the back of that one shot lmao
I love the improvement of all of the original Try Guys here in actually making cake. First time it was mostly weird almost cheese like monstrosities and and picking the best amongst the worst. Now it’s actual critiques on makes the most ideal and appealing cake.
OMG i love Johnny and the winner. Everyone did so good!!!! AAAAHHHHHHHH
51:19 I have been loving Keith's sassy'ness 😂😂😂
ㅇㅎ 알고리즘 떠서봤는데 개량한복 엄청 이쁘네요 ㄷㄷ 나중에 결혼하게되면 꼭 입고싶은 옷이네요 ㄷㄷ
YES MARISSA I honestly thought they were gonna flashback to brownies with “okay so now you guys who gets second through third”
As soon as Keith said “taking their relationship to the next step” I knew immediately that this lunatic was gonna make a freaking set of stairs. 🤣
Eugene being a kick ass friend and coworker and telling her straight up she needs to formulate and excecute plan B. ❤
that camera angle when Keith was being judged was something else.  Marissa was staring right back at me 👀
I love cake. We had an elopement cake where we just got 2 cakes from Whole Foods,  stacked them and ordered pizza. And the big home town wedding cake. We did not keep the top tier, we shared it with the other guests staying at the B&B we were at.
I'd love to see more of Marissa!! She is so delightful and funny! ❤️🖤
Marissa has been my absolute favourite guest so far! really enjoyed her episodes and i hope to see her again sometime in the future!
the chandler bing reference that marissa made 🥺☹️
That intro was out of pocket hahaha
I LOVE how Johnny gives SOO many compliments to each contestant and throws in his little jokes but also the most loving judge in the world lol ❤😂
I love this type of video of you guys! Sometimes, the chaotic upbeat music makes it less relaxing to watch. I wish it would be more background music. ❤
"Go forth, tits out." needs to be a shirt right now.
Minyoung-eomma and Marissa are absolute stars of this episode.   I wanna get a tattoo of Love Doesn't Always Win. Go Forth, Tits Out.
One of the funniest episodes 😂😂😂❤
51:24 I really thought Keith would be 2nd place but damn not today ig
Wish they would stop wasting so many ingredients for "entertainment". It's not funny.
I now have up in my kitchen a little poster that says  "Butter Makes The Batter Better"
I love Marissa. I can't wait to see where she pops up next, she's so much fun. I'm so glad she won and I'm so glad Johnny was giving her so much encouragement and I'm so happy for her. I also loved her reaction and Johnny's reaction to Eugene's mom roasting him. It was so funny.
Not the Disco cake looking like a Dalek 😂
Jonny PLEASE continue to never think before you speak.
LMAO why is nobody talking about the barbie head swallowing kink 😭
I’m so glad they kept Zach’s first joke
Are they gay
I love how supportive Eugene was when Marissa broke the bowl/forgot eggs. Saying “I’ve done that before” 🥹
Is it just me or in the judgment from 46 eugene does not look like he is there ... Is there some green screen thing going on there
I'm so happy for Marissa. But sad for Keith, because his flavors sounded so good. I would eat the hell out of a pine and whiskey cake. Also he looks killer in that dress.
Keith in the dress really lives up to his drama queen fit when he lost
I know Eugene isn’t a romantic person… but how cute would it have been if this was how he proposed to Matt?  Lol.
That S'mores loss really fundamentally changed Zach
Nobody works as hard as these kitchen aid mixers.
They should really have Claire Saffitz as a judge on without a recipe, what a vibe that will be!
23:11 Eugene was so hot here, giving Daddy energy.
I really love how Johnny is just so proud they made something edible. I'll always love him as a contestant or judge. Keep him coming! 🎉❤
Nobody eats the wedding cake?? Maybe if your cake sucks. The diabetics at my wedding went back for seconds.
Eugene's cake was poisonous. I think that should have made it last.
In Brazil, birthday and wedding party without a cake is not a party hahaha
Johnny is the GOAT 😂❤ love him x
Y'all sleeping on how sweet it was to watch Johnny appreciate how far Zack has come along in these 'Without A Recipe' shows. It was so wholesome. Such a darling❤
Keith slowly becoming more chaotic and unhinged with each new episode was entertaining but this absolute meltdown has me in stitches. XD
"I feel like there's gonna be stairs"   one second later *literally ONLY stairs*
I'd love a series where Jonny re-bakes all of the cakes professionally with their input etc. so they can be experienced as intended.
Everyone is commenting on how supportive Eugene was in this video but I feel like that's in nearly every vid. He seems like a guy who's deliberately spicy outside but sweet inside and that's been pretty obvious for a long time now.
Johnny is looking so handsome🫶
I am so impressie by all the cakes, but marissa's is just awesome!  And she looks gorgeous in that black dress with her hair slicked back!!
Zack trying so hard to hold in his laughter made me laugh more than the actual joke😂
Legitimately though!! If Marissa learns how to bake, I think she’d actually do so well. Her flavor combos and ideas for the episodes she was in always piqued my interest. Like, if the marshmallow for the coquito s’mores were better, I’d 100% eat them.
MARISSA CONGRATULATIONS ❤️❤️❤️ YAY DIVORCE!!!🎉
Why did I start crying when Johnny was telling marissa how much potential she has in baking 😢
This is the best episode in without a recipe ever
I must say, for having no recipe, I commend them for their cakes. Not amateurish looking actually
The pattern of Keith getting really aggressive and yelling every time he doesn’t win makes me feel like I’m witnessing an abusive relationship between him and everyone else on set. I want to fast forward through it every time. I can see the discomfort on everyone’s faces. It makes my stomach hurt…
I love that Marissa did credit Eugene with being there and helping her. Yes, she did the baking and all, but without Eugene calming her down, she may not have completed it. Really shows how great of people they are and the friendships these people have with each other.
I'd buy the stairs cakee made by Keith and eat it too!!!  I love the amount of work Keith puts in every time!   I LOVE KEITH SO MUCH! He's the best!;❤🥰
51:30 😭😭😭
Keith needs to win for best dramatic scene lol I needed a good laugh today such a good episode you may of gotten 4th Keith but you were the best dressed if that counts.
Zack’s lavender suit is so dope
I love marissa❤
How do we get Eugene's mom to be a judge on one of these?
Go forth tits out is my new mantra
Love doesn't always win, but tits do
damn i wasnt a eugene girl before this but when eugene organised spiralin marissa's thought process, i felt many things.
keith: has a baby then suddenly acts like a baby around food. all in with his hands mixing it all together into a paste
The amount of ads was actually insane
Keith genuinely annoyed me in this 😂 and Eugene I'm always worried about your thought process 👀🥴
Marissa mentioning Claire Saffitz brought me so much joy.
The minute she mentioned Claire Saffitz, I knew she’d win. I love Claire’s videos! 😊
Eugene made an espresso flavoured cake because his mom’s favourite cake is a coffee cake but coffee cakes are cinnamon flavoured lol there’s no coffee in them, they just pair well with coffee.
Marissa’s presentation was SO good
eugene on this episode with marissa made my heart mealt, he's such a nice person :(
You could also say with Keith's cake, that the couples love will floor-ish 😅
ROFL Eugene's mom is such a toxic Asian response roasting him when hes already down 😂
healthy time limit for them not knowing what they are doing. knowing my cakes i couldn't help but cringe when Eugene dumped in the ENTRE container
Nah Kieth got robbed this ep, two weren’t even wedding cakes lol
Jonny, you are SUCH a gem. I would give anything to be your friend 😂 I would've appreciated that Barbie fact
I literally love Keith’s reactions every time he doesn’t come in first 😂
Zach’s line at the beginning already has me dead 💀 😂
I loved watching Johnny’s soul leaving his body while Eugene’s mom roasted the shit out of him
Keith being a bridezilla is hilarious
Loved this episode - so wholesome and fun! Everyone genuinely tried without gimmicks, and there was still so much drama. Everyone's cake turned out so well! Huge congrats to Marissa, and also Zach for improvement!  I enjoyed not having weed/sex jokes for once as they've gotten old. Though I was surprised no one caught the hydrangeas before the guest judge.
I wish that Keith had sang the climb when his cake was coming out
I love how in the first cake episode, they did Eugene added 12 eggs to his cake and Keith made the same mistake on this one
Keith having a freak out in a wedding dress is everything I didn’t know I needed
Eugene 's Mom gets the award for most cooked because she TORCHED Eugene. Damn 😱
Johnny’s intrusive thoughts 😂
MARISSA IS SO CUTE 🥹🥹
This episode was lovely
"I would never say a woman belongs in the kitchen BUT..." 😭
I’m sorry I wanna like Marissa so bad but holy shit she annoys me 🥲
Claire Saffitz fan club! Get her on the show!!
I love the good sportsmanship. You guys are definitely friends cause you help each other even though it's a competition by giving ideas and pointing out cake falling apart. It's awesome to watch
I've been getting increasingly curious about the show that no one watched throughout this season
Johnny affirming and complimenting Zach's improvement warmed my heart so much omg i adore their dynamic so much
Love the fact that they dont really learn from past WAR, it makes it more hilarious
12:55 😂 53:39
rosanna looks incredible!!!!!!!!
Does anyone else think the batters Keith and Eugene were mixing looked so gross? Or the way Keith just slapped on the frosting cake crumble mixture? I was genuinely surprised how good all cakes ended up looking, considering how messy especially those two were working. No hate, just saying the process looked far from appetising.
Guys can you please try make a compilation of the try guys cooking evolution think you try guys (and team) have come so far so beautiful to see :')
I got divorced at 22, I’m now gonna live by “someone’s who been through that deserves something sweet” cause boy lemme tell ya.
Johnny and the barbie head kink 😂😂😂😂
This is my favorite WAR episode ever!! We had Keith having a meltdown after losing which is always hilarious, Eugene's mom roasting/complimenting him and crazy awesome ideas for cakes. But my favorite is Eugene being so sweet and supportive to Marissa, the whole segment of him calming her down and helping her come up with a plan b was my favorite part.   And I may have bought a slice of cake to have to eat while I watched this ;)
RIP THAT KITCHENAID
Zach, OMG so toxic))))) We are all "wife guys"?)))))
"TODAY WE'RE ALL WIFE GUYS" made me spit out my coffee. 😂😂😂😂
can they practice beforehand?
Officially this season is sweet Eugene!
I love the try guys but this one you can see they aren’t trying haha. Definitely more for entertaining I think Eugene knows not to put straight coffee or so much baking powder haha but love them still!
I am actually so proud of Marissa! That looks delicious, the flavours sound wonderful, the crumb of that cake looks excellent even through the camera. So impressive
can't get over johnny knocking over the champagne glass at at 44:34 LMAO
I love you keith and i always root for u, but u r SUCH a sore loser!!! It pains me to see u get so angry!!! >.< Sometimes i agree with u and think ur frustration is valid, other times it’s a lot. aghh
Marissa stirring that weirdly curdled passion fruit jelly with her fingers will haunt me.
I love Jenny's awkwardness. He's so me 🫶🫶
Eugene deserves first place in being the best of friends to Marissa and helping her get herself back together! So, amazing of him! Was the best part of the episode. Everyone deserves a friend like Eugene to help you pick yourself up when you are struggling and get you to stop and focus. 🥰🎉
The way Eugene got Marissa out of her spiral just like that was everything to me. 🥰
I hate when Keith does this. These tirades of his when he loses? Super not funny and VERY uncomfortable.
I literally choked on my hot chocolate at eugene’s “anti-cake, anti-marriage” tagline💀
I love how proud zach is with his line "today, we r all wife guys" omg this jab is beyond beautiful  lmao
Johnny Cakes is the king of the TMI non sequiters. 😂
Eugene eating keiths flower is so chaotic 😂
Zacks intro💀
Johnny being just so proud of zach and giving him so much praise, eugene regrouping marrisa in such a calm and gentle way, keith's one liners- try guys videos are truly the only consistent thing that brings me so much joy.
I'm so happy Marissa got first, she really deserved it!!!! And Eugene was so sweet for being emotional support through the trials and tribulations of cooking lmao  I'm also so proud of Zach for making a cake that was not only edible but genuinely good, and it's a shame that there had to be a fourth place because Keith's was also incredible
i love eugene for saying multiple times "ive done that before" whenever marissa messes up thats a really lovely way to encourage somebody thru a mess up ❤
Johnny is so sweet.
I wish I had that divorce cake as a wedding cake with my failed marriage. It would have been a lovely warning sign lol
Keith try every donut from voodoo doughnut universal city walk!!
“today we’re all wife guys” LMAO ZACHHH
aw yay!!! so happy for Marissa!! And Zach, it’s clear he’s really grown as a baker!
Keiths bridezilla moment was everything 😂😂😂
To think the guys have reached a point in this show where the only critique the judges had was dryness. Before the judges usually couldn't go through one episode with several, more insane criticisms/comments and gagging or being unable to swallow something they tasted. As someone who thinks weddings and marriage are not really needed in our society today for several reasons, I love and appreciate that a divorce cake won the episode. The fact that it won the wedding cake challenge is hilarious.
we gonna talk about jonny knocking over his champagne and the hard cut after or nah
Marissa could not have looked better in that black dress and slicked back hair.. and the black veil was just ✨ chef's kiss✨ Absolute perfection
Anyone notice Johnny just own his wine glass?
Keith's meltdowns when he loses always get me
am i insane or can i ALWAYS taste when they put coffee/espresso in chocolate cakes
Ok but keith's cake looks like a tamal 🥰
I'll say I enjoyed eating the cake at weddings I've worked at but guests definitely preferred the cookie tables.
So who won the live special?
I want Rachel to participate on this show 😂
This is like my favorite episode yet.
Eugenes mom saying what she said is such an asian mom thing to say 😭😭😭
I love it when Johnny judges! He's always so positive and affirming!
I just realized that they added in a "butter makes the batter better honey" sign in the following Jonny scene. 12:07
MMAARISSSAAAA🎉🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳
The moment where Eugene tells Maurissa she needs a plan B was somehow so sweet to me? Like she was pure panic and he just redirected her to an alternative. It felt like at Keiths wedding when they were trying to figure out a fix for the missing pants, "1 is an accident, 2 is a choice"
Marissa should'nt have won
Marrisa wow so beautiful. The cake was so awesome.
Marissa went from having a meltdown while making this cake...to winning. Well done mama.😂🎉 💔
You don't understand. The way Eugene calmed and helped Marissa made me tear up because I needed that kind of approach whenever I broke down but I got no one around me. 🥹🥹🥹
i can’t believe it took this long for there to be actual poison in a dish
I'm half way through the video and I'm very concerned how bad they will all turn on. I want them to succeed but we all know this won't end well. Not even close
54:29 is it just me or does Eugene just look extra cool? 😂
52:23 lol Keith is a Bridezilla 😂😂😂
Eugene's support to Marisa is amazing!  It's like 'get down to business' but makes you feel good about yourself lol 😊
I’m happy marissa won
Keith spooning globs of butter into all the bowls made me so uncomfortable for some reason lol
“I oversaw the process of sourcing it locally” 😂
Marissa made me soooo happy this season but absolutely this episode. I'm so proud of her and her moment with Eugene genuinely made me start crying.
Keith needs to wear more sweetheart necklines lol it's his silhouette
I’m not even 5 minutes in- “Keith and Zack’s parents are unfortunately still together” Imao I felt that
Earned the like on the first joke
WEAREALLWIFEGUYS  THREWMEEE HAHAHAHAH
I just love how supportive Eugene was with Marissa
Give the editors a raise because when I first saw the Butter Makes the Batter Better sign in the back of Johnny's kitchen, I was like 'No way. Does he actually have that sign?' Made me question my sanity, 'how did I not notice it earlier??' 😂
Euguene should babysit keiths baby
The way that Zach said the wife guy line felt so bad to me and the crew. I wanna see Eugene or Zach win this episode.
Marissa!!!! 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Love that new judge and the fact they helped each other.  Love the new Eugene ❤❤❤
Eugebe helping marissa ☹️☹️
I got married at 18, divorced at 23 🎉❤ I had a divorce party with a divorce cake so I completely agree with Marissa ❤😂
Eugene talking Marissa down from her passionfruit gelatin meltdown was so sweet. 🥺 You could tell she was really panicking and he was able to calm her down so effortlessly, even presenting her with an alternative filling which ended up being a hit! Such a golden moment. Congrats, Marissa! Go forth, tits out! lol  Really enjoyed this episode, and the entire season as a whole!
I love you Johnny 🥹
“love doesn’t always win. and go forth, tits out.” 😂😂😂 LMAO I LOVE MARISSA
Divorce cake wins wedding cake competition.
Eugene’s was literally poisoned. He should’ve been last place
That was actually so funny.
That moment with Eugene talking Marissa through her panic was everything 🥹👏
Congrats to Marissa, the only woman in without a recipe to win first place 🎉🥳🥳🥳🥳
So many wholesome moments 🥹
53:41 Asain mom is savage!
I LOVE how Eugene helped Marissa calm down.
I LOVE MARISSA🖤🤞🏽 Ride or die for her fr😭
I honestly love the headless groom, now all I can think about is praying mantises lol. Great ep all around!
Keith honey. Im no botanist but that tree sure does look like cedar. which may explain the  lack of pine flavour. my deepest condolences
Eugene yawning during Keith’s rant 🤣
my favorite episode so far! I love Marissa and Johnny xD
Eugene calling his mom took me out 🤣🤣
Thank you for saving my future husband’s and my life, Eugene! We were thinking of putting hydrangeas on our wedding cake in June. We’re going to use silk instead of fresh now!
Eugene's spontaneous call had me CACKLINGG
Keith got all four places in this year W.A.R
Loved this! Now I want to see them have more time to do, more things that are more complex? Bigger things that are good? Bigger risks that are kind of a mess but better than they could have been? All of the ways, more time for more skill to be shown / pushed! (ps so happy to see how far they've come 💛)  (ps ps 46:26 update, Marissa's cake is i n c r e d i b l e, I am obsessed! ❤)
I love @TheTryGuys. But seeing who Rosanna is now turns me off to videos she's in.  I have supported them through so much,but I can no longer support anymore videos she's in, including Live Events. I'm definitely not a Me Beast Stan,but to see how petty she is,and the fact she supports TP a woman who has mocked religion Race,sexuality and has a former Stan with Autism harassed ,lied and said he was in her home..the man was getting r Death threats from nutters on the internet! As far as the dead teacher she trashed after death..well ppl say oh that's sensitive it may have happened..the time didn't line up,the story kept changing she swore there was police reports on him and that she went to court and testified..all that has been fact checked and proven to be lies. Yet RP says they've been pals for years,and  so she could find someone who was jealous of Mr. Beast,and hates him herself,she joined in with a predator a racist a homophobic,and just someone who problematic.  I thought this summer when I seen her have a melt down and tantrum,Lord I hope she doesn't pull this with rry guys! Everyone has a right to edit as they please,and yes Mr Beast could have been called out ina mature fashion,but she turns to someone as vile as TP?!🙄 I once watched her videos..but what I see. This summer from her,let's me know she's a fake herself. IMO,and IMO she's no longer endearing..you can see now behind her fake smile & laugh  I will support try guys..but sorry guys..not when Roseanna is around. Love y'all,I just have principles I won't  break. ✌️ &❤️
Eugene is such a sweet heart the way he gave advice when she was panicking shows how he would make an amazing leader and boss
hold on now, i'm with Keith i totally remember the judges saying his cake wasn't as dry as Eugene's. am i insane??
I found it so sweet that Marissa thanked Eugene and gave him credit for helping him through her spiral. That truly shows good sportsmanship! I'm really impressed!!! Plus, even in the idea stage her cake sounded incredible and then she brought out the Claire Saffitz tips! Immediately shot up to my number one Try Person spot. Love you Marissa!!!!  Bring back Marissa, Kwesi, and Jared for another season! We loved them!!!!
Lets talk about Eugene's mom giving the MOST ASIAN MOM ANSWER EVER TO HIS FAILING, I CAN'T XDDDD But Keith being a bridezilla made me too happy. 😂
Everyone who watched Oreos, watching Eugene's mixing: O_O
Did anyone notice that the plant Keith used wasn't actually pine? It looks like a cypress of some type. Couldn't have been a juniper because they would have smelled and tasted that.  Nobody died, so that's something 😂
31:08 he's so real
Keith wearing a wedding dress is so nice. Dude looks fire!
I love this series great job guys omg 💖 I'm obsessed with the Dis-Cake design 🪩
This was def one of my fav episodes 😂
Marissa is a dream goth waifu
lol the "your cancelled".... XP XD
Marissa’s tits look amazing!!!
hearing the generic music SortedFoods uses for their pass it ons in another cooking show is weird
I'd love to see soft pretzels and cheese dip next season
Yaaaay divorce!!!
Eugene saying put your hands up when the glass broke is someone who belongs in the kitchen he'd be great if he tried
Ohno marissa never start an appliance without securing it..
Keith losing to poison and a non wedding cake is wild
LOVE Marisa’s cake, it was so cool!!! And love all the supportive vibes coming from Jonny this episode ❤
Ugh I hate it when Keith yells at the judges. It’s not a good bit, it’s just super uncomfortable.
Marissa is seriously so pretty
Eugene and the fondant made me so happy ❤❤
The person in the back yelling “in that dress??” Sent me 😂
Listen Marissa’s cake was great but I still think Zach should have won! Justice for Zach his was a wedding cake too like come on lol
If there's a new season i would wanna see them make jelly art cakes
Thinking about how Keith could switch daddy’s favourite for Henry’s favourite in future without a recipes🥹 now that he has a son
Keith turning into a bridezilla though 😂
Lmao Keith going full bridezilla! 😂 hahaha
I love the new era of try guys, the new personalities, the vibes, it all comes together really well and I love it. The way Johnny roots for them and hypes them up is nice. The new additions to the team are all amazing. I'm so happy for Marissa this episode 👏 This without a recipe season was excellent.
hi
Did anyone else almost get teary eyes when Johnny praised Marissa?
Zac: In this we're all wife guys  💀
Good job Marissa 😊
I’d love to see Jonny make the cakes properly so we can see the full design and idea
Eugene saying “my mom is gonna be so mad” was so cute and endearing
I love that Johnny is so happy for his friends and doesn’t mind showing his love.
Zach has come so far cooking wise in relation to past episodes, I'm so proud of you!! 👏👏
Will The Live Show Be On YouTube After The Showing?
The editing... Wow. Butter makes the batter better honey behind Johnny 😂😂😂
Jonnys unhinged commentary this episode is sooooo funny. I feel like as he's been in more episodes the more of his real personality we see and it's so relatable. The insant regret he had about the barbie head comment had me cackling
Marissa is my new favorite. So happy she won and her attitude is just wonderful. Can’t wait til next season.
I love all the outfits for the presentation but especially Eugene’s Hanbok and Marissa’s Basic Instinct look
We had a cannabis infused wedding cake and all of the youngins wanted a slice haha  we made cupcakes for the kids and the older folks
I could watch Keith going Bridezilla forever ❤
today we’re all wife guys had me on the floor😂😂
Ok but Keith in that dress stole the show for me hahah like it fits him so well??! Very flattering, love the neckline
Johnny being a proud dad is so cute 😂😂
where can i buy zach's lavender suit???
HONORARY TROPHIES GO TO...🥁🥁🥁🥁... Keith- Most Elegant Cake Eugene- Most Colorful Cake  Zach- Most Fun Cake  Marissa - Most Un-wedding Cake
Thank you for having good subtitles <3 Genuinely noticeable and appreciated immensely.
“When my mom and dad got divorced she started fucking my world history teacher and now they're married” OOOOOPP LMAOOOO THAT TOOK A TURN
“Today we’re all wife guys”  IS CRAZY 😭😂😂
I disagree about people not caring about cake at weddings. I get so excited for cake, when it's bad or sad I am so bummed out.
Eugene literally gave them poison but somehow didn’t come 4th?
The without a recipe series is a must watch for everyone
“Im so glad its over much like my marriage” LMAOOO IM DEADDDD
4:27 children love wedding cakes. and getting in the frosting
Marrisa is looking good!
I loveeeee Keith’s meltdown it’s always my favorite part!
“i’m smiling because i’m uncomfortable” SO REAL
Zach’s cake looks like a Dalek from Dr Who
Eugene and marissa are so wonderful together
Eugene talking about the whole his mom’s wedding to herself thing… not gonna lie kinda reminds me of Reagan’s mom from Inside Job.
I love how Eugene saved to honor his mom for the big finale
I absolutely love Johnny!
12:08 ADDING IN THE SIGN AFTER!!!!! I ONLY JUST NOTICED IT OMG!!!!!!!!!!
Keith looks beautiful
Eugene’s mom is *savage* 😂😂😂
omg the "Butter Makes The Batter Better Honey" placed behind Jonny was genius editing! New merch haha
How is no one at all talking about “Today we are all wife guys” like ZACHARY🤣🤣🤣🤣I love you
I’m so proud of Marissa🤧
Zach telling Marissa she isn’t invited back next season😂😂
As a baker, this was the most PAINFUL thing to watch 😩😢😭😂
Zach that lavender suit!!!!!!! Fire!!!!!!!! Lookin good!!!!!!!
Maple was right there!! Keith 😢 but also I loved the stairs lol 😂
PETITION TO HAVE GORDON RAMSAY AS A JUDGE
she foine
i came here to see 2 things, iykyk
I feel like Johnny was extra sweet and encouraging in this episode, and it was so lovely to see 🥰
congrats Marissa! she really is a part of the try guys by now. loved how eugene supported her telling her she needed a plan b and how genuinely impressed johnny was.
someone pls invite eugene to their gay wedding!
Eugene denying helping Marissa at the judging is so Asian to me
Jonny is *so* proud if Z for making something edible. He's like, who cares about dense, this tastes like *FOOD*
Jonny’s champagne!
everyone looks so good!! and i love Keith's dress so much
YAY MARISSA <3
“Today, we’re all wife guys” had me howling 😂
I love how eugene tried to calm marissa down and help her find solution. He's such a lovely man i want to have a friend like that
IN THAT DRESS!!!! hahahahaha
This episode almost made me tear up. I absolutely love Marissa. She has her own personality that blends and pops out at the same time. The pairing of Eugene and Marissa was magic! Eugene's firm yet warm stop to her spiral is one of my all-time favorite Try Guys moments now. And the way the judges all agreed with Johnny's assessment of Marissa's skills and her reaction... Heartwarming. Just, wow! I'm so excited to see the new Try Guys these upcoming months and how they grow and transform. Honestly, looking back, that whole thing that happened that sent them into this stage was a total blessing in disguise and I'm so excited to see where it leads! 👏👏
Stairs were popular on wedding cakes in the 80s. Not literally shaped like stairs lol but they would connect the cakes together with tiny staircases.
i’m always secretly rooting for eugene so whenever it looks like his is not going well i’m like NO lmaoo
Watching eugene put hydrangeas on his cake was torture, im not even a baker im just a plant nerd😭
Eugene helping Marrisa. i love how they genuinly care and stayed calm.
Ive loved this season, and Jonny is so sweet, especially hyping up Zacks and Marrisa's cakes i hope he comes back as a judge next year!
i really cannot overstate just how much johnny adds to without a recipe
I say this was all the respect in the world - Marissa is so frickin hot, I can't even handle it.
Johnny is my favorite person
why am i tearing up at jonny telling marissa that she has a future in cake making 😭 so sweet 😭
I was not able to focus on anything else except how good johnny looked in that suit
one of my favourites things about WAR is jonny's look of dread whenever zach is presenting his food
eugene - dry zack - dense keith - normal marissa- divorced
Can't believe Marissa won and it wasn't even a wedding cake 😭
Love that Eugene made a six reference with "divorced and died" and then accidentally beheaded the groom on the cake topper... "Divorced, beheaded, died" 🤣
Im so proud of Marissa!!
wow
This episode was so amazing and chaotic, i love their energy 😂❤
Johnny’s fun fact was the best  we love fun facts in this house.
According to Eugene, I'm over 50. I don't really dance at weddings and usually the food sucks, so the cake is the one thing I hold out hope for. And I have yet to be let down by a wedding cake.
every episode everyone looks increasingly more uncomfortable with Keith’s intense reactions hahahahhaha
Zach's cake looks like R2D2's cousin  😂
I had that before and i learnt the hard way. Never put "hard rock" or "one slab piece" of butter into the mixer. That butter is tougher than all the equipments...
this shit-eating grin after “TODAY, WE’RE ALL WIFE GUYS.” is so fucking good
"maybe I panic the first hour and do nothing" Words to live by
Eugene is the softest, kindest person inside 🥹
suddenly I understand why my friends want to be my mom's friends the moment they meet her, and that is perhaps just a Korean mom thing <3
Zach is such a goofy naughty little goober the start already got me howling
keith took johnny too literally on this one
Are we going to acknowledge how gorgeous Marissa is with her hair slicked back like this or..?
Eugene’s mom unintentionally roasting the absolute shit out of him and his baking is hilarious. It explains a lot.
I can confidently say I fully appreciate the tits out movement. I also feel as if the editor had a bias towards that statement as well.
Eugene helping Marissa with her filling it the highlight of this video  ❤
Pffff why did they censor the stair?
Dang Eugene’s little pep talk with Marissa just shows how he’d be a good uncle one day.
The worst thing in this video is Zach saying that a 1/2 tsp of vanilla is fine for a cake 😭😂 make that a tbsp my dude
Berries and cream?! Oh, hurrah!
I fucking love Jonny Cakes 🤣🤣🤣
Seeing Keith in that wedding dress shows me I should stop wearing halter tops (as a broad shouldered woman) 🤣🤣🤣
Keith begging: "pick me! choose me! love me!"
Desiree screaming "IN THAT DRESS?!" had me crackling up! BEST ANSWER EVER
my jaw dropped at zach's intro LOL
Keith's Bridezilla moment 😂😂😂
“Butter makes the batter better honey” 😂 also Marissa continues to impress me with her ideas and using her PR culture with her foods and when Eugene was calming her down and ending it with “yeah” he sounded so much like Gordon Ramsey. And Johnny is so sweet with Zach and Marissa. “All stars” hahaha.
If I do not see Eugene chompin down on that rose in an edit I am going to be sad 😂
23:54 Eugene is hashtag squadgoals
The immediate shade from Zach is iconic 🥸🤌
TODAY WE ARE ALL WIFE GUYS! AHHHAHAHA
I’m sorry, 2 days?!?! It takes professionals longer than that to make and decorate a cake
I love that he gets red even when he’s fake mad 😂
The next phoning it in BETTER have a team with Johnny and marissa
These cakes really represent how marriage is. There's no recipe, they're imperfect and chaotic, everything is a bit of a mess, and one of them is literally toxic.
Incredible episode. The poison flowers, a call to mom, discake, keithzilla, and the absolutely beautiful moments with Marissa and Johnny. Marissa your presentation was amazing, as was your cake. Bravo everyone.
Bring in Min for more roasts
Johnny Cakes is one of my favorite humans and deserves 10000000x more appreciation than he thinks he gets
ITS OUR SPECIAL DAYYYYYY
Keith: I'm making a pine simple syrup. [Proceeds to boil a bunch of cedar, not pine]
I LOVE MARISSAAAA
I would burst into to tears if Johnny said all that nice stuff to me 😭😭😭😭
Minyoung, ice cold. 😂 It would have been fine if he hadn’t tried to poison the judges.
I'm still waiting for the "Without a Recipe" Recipe Book where they compile some of the best things they made but make them actual edible and able to make.
Go fourth tits out!! Yes Marisa
I loved Marissa here, she's so funny! She has the same energy as the guys 😂
marissa is so fun, hilarious and a vibe on her own... congrats woman!
Maggie taking a bite right out of her wedding cake is a power move. I love that lmao.
Love doesn’t always win and tits out🫡
Am I the only one who saw the champagne glass spill when Jono went to go feed Keith his cake 😂 - no one reacted hahahaha
Marissa said: Love loses!  I appreciate that.
The judges were so nice this season…let’s bring back Matt
Omgg the editor adding the “butter makes the batter better honey” sign at 12:10😅
Jonny needs to have Marissa in one of his videos teaching her how to bake a simple cake!
Keith’s cake shape but covered with florals. I’d give off cascading garden vibe and I think it would be beautiful.
As the law clearly states, "If you defeat every other Try Guy, you are now hired as the newest Try Guy."
you guys are always funny but this is HILARIOUS. and I love Marissa.
I'm amazed it all went so well!! The only horrible thing was accidentally poisoning the cake!! What a high!
Anyone notice Johnny’s champagne glass spill at 44:34
I'm sorry but is everyone just ignoring the wife guy comment from Zach at the beginning?
Does anyone know where Ro got her dress?? So pretty
after having two mental breakdowns during one of my finals and absolutely tanking the other, this made my night so thank you
The way I gasped when Eugene put hydrangeas right on the cake because my wedding flowers were hydrangeas and I know you can’t do that because they’re poisonous
Pine is not a hard wood Keith.
Looks like Keith's "pine" isn't pine at all! Exciting times!
I too, have a great talent for eating.   Also Johnny nurturing talent in Marissa is the most wholesome thing ❤
Hahah Eugene’s mom reminds me of my mom
Eugene help Marissa 😅❤️
Can I still order cod tickets even though it’s the day after?
marissa's arc in this is so good omg we love to see it
Keith giving big Homelander vibes
Marissa with Eugene is my favorite combo ❣️
Keith’s energy was everything in this video 😂😂😂
Any1 caught the "Butter makes the batter better, honey" in the background of Johnny's kitchen
I would pay a lot of money for a t-shirt that says "Go Forth Tits Out"
When Johnny said "you should rather mix by hand" Keith took it literally 🤣💀
Marissa fine af
Everyone's already said this but Eugene grounding Marissa was for real so frickin sweet wow i love that. shoutout!
I didn't even make it past the wife guys comment before I lost it 🤣
Gotta love Jonnys signature oversharing  😂😂😂
Marissa....them thangs thangin...girl great job
MARISSA SWEEP!!!
This was cringe an could read between the jokes .
I fucking ruined like 10 different spice loaves at school a few weeks ago because I put in 1/4 of the amount of baking soda I was supposed to. Shit was so dense. It was like fudge when it’s supposed to be fucking like coffee cake
I did not notice the “butter makes the batter better honey” sign photoshopped in at 12:06 the first time around omg 😂 Well done editors
I really appreciate the effort into this video but the best part was ‘today we’re all the wife guy’ I died on the floor 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I feel like the fact they put their cakes in a freezer really dried them out…
Eugene was so sweet this whole episode 😢😊.
IM SO EXCITED
I loved Eugene just grabbing the flower out of Keith's hand and Keith yelling "My flower!"
johnny is so not sober here 🤣🤣 this out of pocket man just made my day
i live for bridezilla keith
The into though that was a deep burn full thickness 😂😂😂😂
As a fellow second-generation Asian-American daughter, Eugene’s call with his mom was so real 😂😭
Keith was serving cunt not cake
Wonder if Johnnies divorce cake was for his mom
Eugene's Mom's response...I'M  SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAMING!!!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I know it’s a joke and I still love him, it would make me a little scared and uncomfy being around Keith when he “blows up”
Keith actually chose such a pretty dress for himself, it literally fits so perfectly on him 😂
I just realized... anyone remeber the geodesic dome? Zack did it better 😏
thank you johnny, for that piece of information i wish i never knew 😆
EUGENE IS SUCH A SWEET HEART!!! The way he had sympathy for Marissa when she was having a tough time with her passion fruit and encouraged and empowered her to win!!!
love that eugene helped marissa with her filling! honestly, that jam suits the broken heart better - like its bleeding 💔
Not even a minute in and Zach comes out swinging hard.
Kieth made a cake that was so dry it was judged as worse than a cake that had 2 out of 3 tiers be poisonous
I’m less than a minute in and the vibes are immaculate
I love that Eugene is calming Marissa. He's so amazing ❤
Wouldn't be fun if they actually created a recipe book for their without a recipe creations!
I LOVE that Eugene firmly but kindly told Marissa she needed a plan B and helped her regroup and refocus when she started to spiral.He was so helpful and encouraging!
Can we talk about how great Zach looks in that lavender though?!!!
I love how they have a “butter makes the batter better honey” sign in Johnny’s example kitchen 😂
"Love doesn't always win, and go forth, tits out." Instantly iconic.
Oh my God I love Eugene he's such a mommy
Listen, just be like most Pittsburgh weddings and have a cookie table.
The butter makes the batter better honey sign behind Johnny!!!👏👏👏😂
"I'm smiling because I'm uncomfortable" - Rosanna Pansino 2023.  Us Ro us🤝🫂
I love that Zach made a wedding cake for LaurDIY and Jeremy 😂
The fact that Eugene’s was poisonous and Keith STILL lost😂😂😂😂
I love Eugene’s mom so much 😂❤
Zach is an absolute SAVAGE coming in with that wife guys joke I’M DEAD. 💀😂
Eugenes mum killed me XDDD mums are the best!
The fact you won last place IN THAT DRESS is enough to cancel Christmas over… 😭
Eugene's mom is the highlight of the episode
"We're all wife guys" ZACHHHHH STFU HAHAHAHHAHAHA
Happy she won 😂 I woulda been so upset if she didn’t
Jaw on the floor during that phone call lmao
“Today, we’re ALL wife guys” 😂 The most wholesome and simultaneously piercing shade thrown by Zach!
Eugene being supportive and pulling Marissa back from a bad mental space has me tearing up???
Zach...definitely a wedding cake. My sister would absolutely fall in love with this whole idea you've created! She loves glitter and sparkle and would love to have a design inspired by what you've made! Great job!!!  There was a ton of ads. I really hated the number of ads I had to sit through to see this video. I hope this isn't gonna be that way all the time and that it's just a fluke. lol
I feel like 2/3 of a cake being inedible/poisonous should automatically make it 4th place BUT I really enjoyed this episode :)) so cute
That beginning joke 😂
I have to imagine that Rachel had a moment of panic when she realised that one of the foods served to the judges was poisoned
I love Eugene’s mom “I’m sorry to say this but I don’t think you have much talent for cooking… you have a great talent for eating though”
Who's gonna tell Eugene that coffee cake isn't coffee (nor espresso) flavored.
Without a recipe is like a rollercoaster every single episode and that’s why I love it
keith is starting to activate my PTSD
The fact that Eugene got anything other than last place when two thirds of his cake was literally poisonous is so astonishing to me.
I'm so happy for Marissa but also Eugene is a real one for calming her down in her moment of panic and giving her logical solutions, that's a real friend. Also his mom is hilarious, that was some shit my parents would also say. This season has been so good, thank you for putting out such wonderful (and lengthy) videos
The shade thrown at the start was everything
"we're all wife guys" ZACH NO
I love when Keith lossed it... He is cute when angry 🤣
I’ve really enjoyed spending more time with Marissa!
Eugene was such a reassuring and supportive friends this episode. Yelling for marissa to raise her hands when bowl Broke and then reassuring her it was okay to helping her. Love him
best series ever, so happy you guys are posting the baking without a recipe again
I haven't seen someone bounce back THIS hard on a WAR episode since Keith's disaster pie. From a mid-episode catastrophe to a win 😂
54:23 ROASTED oh my goodness I'm crying laughing
Favorites!!
Whoever said “in that dress?!?”, I just want you to know I see you and I love you. Go forth and instigate. 😂😂😂
Spoiler:  The winning cake of the wedding cake competition is the divorce cake. 😂😂
marissa's mixer bowl explosion is EXACTLY why i have a metal bowl in my kitchenaid, because if i used glass bowls i would have gone to the e.r. at least four times. she speaks for us all when she says "shit. oh. shit"
Is no one talking about how iconic "Today we're all wife guys" in the intro was?? 😂
Holy smokes, Marissa is a turbocutie.
the fact that they edited "butter makes thebatter better honey" in 12:08 😂
the fact that they edited "butter makes thebatter better honey" in 12:08 😂
I love how Eugene’s mom is more Eugene than Eugene. It’s his origin story
They are getting cringier and cringier by the day
WE’RE ALL WIFE GUYS LOLLLLLL
Eugene being way too nice here
51:18 to 52:53 That's exactly what I was here for.
Congratulations Marissa 💜
Eugene coaching Marissa was the kind of support I needed to see today
Eugene's cake really said "divorced, beheaded and died" and I love it
Johnnys wonderful
OK but I fell in love with Keith's cake. Like visually it's almost perfect. Minimum details, brown with gold and pines. idk, it really feels like MY wedding cake.
in a squidward voice... myyyy wifeeee
My Roman Empire is now thinking about the 'swallowing Barbie heads kink'.
Omg look at Zach killing it .
Everyone needs a Eugene when they are breaking down. 👏🏾
There are segments of CLOSED CAPTIONS MISSING in the beginning! Please fix this, Try Guys! — a viewer who needs subtitles
I watched the show 😂. They keep saying no one watched .😅 I loved it ❤
I have a feeling that Johnny's one of those friends that you should not tell secrets too.
0:27 ZACH!!!
Zach's absolute glee saying they are all wife guys absolutely gave me life
You guys are def shadow banned, i am subscribed and never see your videos in my feed
“Love doesn’t always win. Go forth, tits out.” I love her
OMG 48:33 🤣🤣🤣
21:47 "Typically, I don't even bother"
This episode made me so emotional, Marissa deserves everything 🥹🩷
Does Keith not like Jonny lol? He always has a weird vibe towards him
“Johnathon Cakes”
such a great episode!! so proud of u zach and marissa 🥳 good job to keith and eugene as well! also, the editing?? hello?? the quote keith said is literally behind jonny when he was baking his cake, so funny 😭
I love Johnny’s glee at Keith’s outburst! 😂
I'm so sorry you're cancelled! AHAHAHHAHASHHA I love bride Keith
Minh is a legend!
Everything about what Jonny was saying was so emotional and inspiring and then Zach said 48:32 HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
Wife guy joke right at the top of the video... EXCELLENT
Keith's tyraid had me rolling.
Eugene's mom truly stole the show with the phonecall. Savage
we often Joke about the guys poisoning the judges with their cooking. NOw, eugene has made somethign ACTUALLY, LITERALLY poisonous  this is why you do your research FIRST, so you don't poison people by accident.
Just want to say that conceptually a stair-cake is a great idea for a wedding... but if it were actually made beautifully and elegantly. The image of the bride helping the groom up the last step from the concept image is a really beautiful idea and I think that could be seen at actual weddings without people thinking it looked weird. That being said, keith clearly made a flavourless, dry, malformed monstrosity that he himself said was inspired by "Pinesol" and "Floors." Deserving of 4th place. But the concept is a winner.
"I want this totaste like a tree!"  fucking WHY THO  Keith do you think people eat TREES? ON THE WHOLE?  Why are you so obsessed with making things taste like things they shouldn't? ANd keep thinking it won't end upa failure when you try that?  edit: I may have overreacted just on hearing him say that out of pocket, but it does seem to me that keith may take certain ideas a bit too literally without thining how it'll work, in general.
Eugene with the Jimbo reference!!
I want to see more Marissa! She's amazing
12:00  keith : "Butter makes the batter better sounds like something that would be up in like a mom's kitchen." 12:06 the mom in question:
are we all going to ignore the joke zach made at the start 😭😭
Please please please can you make a Marissa goes and try’s different recipes with professionals episode/series!!!!!
❤❤❤marissa❤❤❤❤
The most BRIEF moment where Keith says butter makes the batter better, and then it appears behind Johnny right after. Beautiful 😚🤌🏻
Nicole is by far the coolest most fashionable judge of the series, she's amazing!
Also Jonny just blurting out stuff is so me, I love him 😊😂❤
Sometimes I feel like all Rosanna has to say is negative things. You could tell Johnny was so proud of Zach and all she had to say was it was dense and even the way she looked eating Marissa’s cake.
Marissa we're so proud of you!! 🤗❤ And the wholesome moment of Eugene talking her down from a panic and back on track was just so sweet 🥺
Ideas  3 vs 1 Baking Pro without a recipie and an amature with a recipie
Eugene is SO SWEET!!! 💖💖💖  Eugene calls his mom & she roasts him!!! "You don't have much talent for cooking. You have much talent for... eating."  Eugene's Mom: That the last one? Keith: No, it's not the last one.
can Keith Try taking an L with humor and grace? not in this lifetime...
Marissa looked so good with her black veil.
NOT THE WIFE GUY JOKE😂😂😂😂
Why does Marissa kinda look like aubrey plaza in the thumbnail?
MARISSA🥹💗
God Rosanna looked so flipping pretty this episode!! I love that dress so much! And also there was Keith
Keith made the folklore cabin's stairs cake and Zach made a mirrorball cake, we always knew they were swifties at heart <3
Zach's wedding cake looks like a dalek 😂😂😂😂
Eugene looks so HANDSOME?!?!?!?!?! Is it the color of the modern Hanbok or just the modern Hanbok or BOTH OR JUST EUGENE
Eugene was super cool in helping, calming, and guiding Marissa. great moment there.
they should do teams and face each other
congratulations Marissa!!!
oh no, Eugene's call with his mom 😭 I feel bad for laughing cause that's actually really sad omg Eugene is so talented 🙈
roll back the tapei 😂😂😂
Jonny's comment to Marissa 😭😭😭😭 so sweet!!!
Not the Jimbo reference at 50:25 💀💀💀
thank you so much for the BEST season of WAR ever!!!!! these 6 episodes (and the live) were so much more fun than the previous years (and we know why) - so refreshing to see FOUR creative fun ideas for each episode.
44:56 When marissa's judging starts.
Ok but why keith looking sooo good in that wedding dress!! 😂
This was my favorite episode yet by far! Everyone was so sweet and encouraging and hilarious!!!❤
What an INSANE way to open this episode holy fuck 😂
I would marry Keith in a heartbeat
rhis episode is so sweet i almosr cried 😂
Upset and screaming Keith is getting old. Keith please stop. You are so much better than this raging character.
I just want to echo other people’s comments that I would LOVE to see a Marissa/ Johnny cakes series where he teaches her the ways of baking!
This episode was so wholesome! I was genuinely impressed with both Zach’s 100% correct ratio of ingredients as well as Marissa’s final cake! Eugene’s bit about Six the musical and then his phone call to his mom at the end were incredible. Keith looks great in a wedding dress and I liked his passion for floor cleaner haha. Excellent judging as well! Just an all around wonderful episode!
Props to the editing team!! These vids wouldn’t be half as funny without the editors!
I feel like baking this cake healed Marissa's divorce trauma.
As a divorced dad…this is a big win for our people 😎 Congrats Marissa!
Spoiler:      When Keith got fourth place he was acting out his inner bridezilla!
This is my favorite episode 😭❤️
Marissa almost forgot the eggs 😂😂😂😂
Eugene's mom roasting him was so priceless lol.
"You dont have much talent for cooking, but you have a talent for eating" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Imagine getting roasted so bad by ur motherrr
The Zach and Eugene banter, even though they're not even in the same room 😂😂😂 "I'm Eugene, it doesn't matter how it tastes, it just has to look good" "I'll do the Zach thing: bullshit my way to 4th place"
Day 1 of asking for more Smoke Show
Wow, A+ video, A+ vibes, A+ cakes.
i enjoyed this episode so much 🥺 i wish there was more i wish it was longer this made me sooo happy today 🩵
These overreactions aren't funny anymore.
10:21 is HILARIOUS 😅😂🤣
"Today we are all wife guys" 😂😂😂😂 🎉I'm dead
i'm calling qtcinderella
Shoutout to editor who made 'Butter makes a batter better honey' in Johnny's kitchen. I snorterd... 🤣
I saw other comments about “you’re not good at cooking but you’re good at eating” and I immediately assumed someone said that to Keith to comfort his inevitable rage at fourth place. Never would I have expected MAMA EUGENE TO HAVE SAID IT TO EUGENE HELLO????
I. LOVE. EUGENE. 😤
Absolutely loved every aspect of this episode of without a recipe like literally every aspect and though alot of parts stuck out to me such as Zach telling Marissa she won't be back , and Keith canceling the judges, and Eugene getting roasted by his momma the part at the very end where their talking about the live one and Keith say you get to decide who wins with the eye twitch got me over here 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Can we just appreciate how awesome Marissa looks?
Today we’re all wife guys 😭🤣
Awesome ep. Kudos.
Jonny's lack of filter sustains me
1:46 ahhh…. My life motto:)
Zach’s Stanley Tucci shirt is amazing
I definitely watched the first episode of Food Network WAR and got really disappointed because everything felt super dumbed-down- the jokes had to be censored, the funny hijinks were erased, and the editing made the show positively depressing. I stopped watching after the first episode and I was secretly a little relieved after everything happened because I knew the show was almost certainly not getting a renewal.
the wife guys line was mad 💀💀
Jonny's comments to Marissa was soooo cute and heartwarming. And the editing of Rosanna "laughs in agreement" at the end made me cackle. lol
Butter makes the batter better honey, being on a sign behind Johnny is just amazing.
This is by far the best season all the episodes were enjoyable it was so fun
The “we’re all wife guys “ comment took me tf out
I didn’t realize Keith was wearing a weeding dress
OH ZACH U DIDNT SAY THAT IN THE INTRO 😭
unrelated storytime! the only gay wedding ive been to was for two chefs. one works in a restaurant and the other works in a cheese store (graduated from art school) and they had a bunch of different smaller cakes that their coworkers and friends helped them make
TODAY WE'RE ALL WIFE GUYS (T.T)
I really feel like the judges were too lenient about Eugene poisoning two tiers of the cake which is iconic but not the goal
They all agreed it wasn’t a wedding cake and yet she won 💀
I just have to say I'm very proud of everyone today. Especially Zach though, he's made so much progress as a baker.
Rachel said she makes all the challenges herself right?? I’m dying to know how her wedding cake looked!
Epic episode!
fantastic episode but Minyoung STOLE THE SHOW
This was so funny omg
Omgggggg “Today we’re all wife guys” 💀💀💀💀
Zack made his cake for the Renaissance tour lol
“Love doesn’t always win, and go forth tits out.” -Marissa 2023
I stan Marissa.   Also i wish I could go tit out but not everyone has as good tits as our winner. >-<
With her hair slicked back, Marissa is giving me Aubrey Plaza vibes and I love it.
WIFE GUYS 😂😂😂😂
They really make you wanna bake/cook with them🥹.
Omg, Keith did not use a pine plant.  I think it's a Lemon Cypress, but it might be another kind of cypress or juniper. Definitely not pine though lol! (the needles are attached to the stem in a scaly way, not in bundles like a pine) Anyways, google says though Lemon Cypress is non-toxic, it's not exactly edible either. I guess two Try Guys tried to poison the judges with plants!
I am so happy Marissa won! Her cake sounded amazing!! And Eugene supporting her 🥹
I can’t help it.  All I see when I look at Zach’s cake is a Dalek 🫣
i love when rachel is like' shut tf up and eat the goddamn cake
not eugene comparing his mom to king henry viii 😭😭😭
32:17 stop HES ICONIC
Divorce wins the marriage episode 😂😂
Keith is lowkey becoming a villain. I'm a little worried and excited for him. ilysm don't push yourself too hard Keith<3
We love Marissa! Petition to have her as 4th try guy
Next season on Second Try- Marissa becomes Johnny Cakes apprentice in the kitchen and they surprise Eugene with a sweetheart cake.
Lol, Eugene's batter looks like the tar monster that killed Tasha Yar on Star Trek TNG!
“Hey you’re not invited back next season 😂❤️”
Zach's cake looks a lot like a Dalek.
Goeth forth, tits out.    I like her style.
How did y’all get lilac hydrangeas when I told it would cost $30/flower to get them for my wedding
I was sooo happy for Marissa this episode!! it was so wholesome seeing her efforts be appreciated and she was definitely my fav guest this season! great chemistry with the guys and you could tell she cared and tried so hard with all the creations, really hope they bring her back! 🥰
Fuchsia? How is that light pink fuchsia?
Eugene is a sweetheart. I love him so much :')
Zach if you see this where on earth did you get that amazing Stanley Tucci shirt
Okay literally everything else aside I am shocked that Eugene has never been to a gay wedding??
that's a wENDing cake (i'm sorry)
I love how it's the married people vs the anti-marriage people!  I'm with the latter
Keith: Honey ✅ Grown on trees ✅ By the bees ✅ 😂😂😂
eugine's cake looks like an upholstered cushion
Eugene is such a great friend!!! ❤
Plz tell me I’m not the only one who thought it was Lena the plug in the thumbnail
The fact that they all managed to make completely (mostly) edible cakes shows how much the guys have improved and absorbed through out all their cooking and baking experience.  And Marissa coming in and killing it! Great episode
"today we're all wife guys" i fucking love zach lmao
Go Marissa!!!🎉🙌🏼
Eugene calling his mom had me CRYING with laughter 🤣🤣🤣
Oh my gosh I thought that was Aubrey Plaza in the thumbnail😂
Keith’s being an epic bridezilla.
Lol Eugene was getting flashbacks to when Zach had glass in his leg But honestly, Eugene was so nice ❤ Love how Keith went into bridezilla mode 🤣 And Eugene’s mum was so funny 😂😂
Johnny is so sweet 🥹🥹🥹
I never thought there would be a better cooking show than Nailed It, but after watching every episode of both shows I can say THIS IS MY FAVORITE COOKING SHOW!! And this is your best episode so far. So wholesome, funny and Marissa really nailed it!
Jonny was really just letting his internal thoughts out 😂😂😂
Keith’s immediate “I disagree” fueled me 😂
THE EDITING AT 12:06 BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
When they were roasting wedding cakes I was just like 'yaaaaaas.' I love a good cake, and I have hated every wedding cake or 'fancy expensive cake' I've had for any reason because they're dry and lacking in flavor. I don't know if anyone can make fondant not ruin a cake but every fondant-ified cake I've ever had has been disgusting. It's a cake made to look at, not eat. And if you're going to spend a ton of money on a cake, it better be edible!! So, everyone I know skipped the wedding cake (at least, the 'official' wedding cake) because it was way too overpriced to get something that was disappointing at best. The best alternative I've seen is cupcakes, which are quite popular I've found since they are low mess and easy to divvy out in single servings.
God I hope this is Marissa's baking origin story.
Eugene’s mom is soooo Mrs. Kim from Kim’s convenience to janet LOL
Jonny cakes is hilarious
eugene and marissa being paired and zach and keith being pared was a brilliant pairing and i love it so much. eugene and marissa both take, as they said, the "more is more" approach
Omg I love this episode so much this is for sure on my top 5 😭😭😭😂😂😂
Im so proud of everyone. They did so well!!
Every episode with Jonnycakes is such a DELIGHT
i ADORE eugene’s mom, she’s so unintentionally funny
Such a good season!! cant wait for the next :) I absolutely love with out a recipe, I always look forward to watching it every year!
Johnny cakes should always be a judge he’s so sweet and nice
Jonny over shares so much😭😭😭
Keith becoming a bridezilla was just perfect for this video :))) Great finale!
okay but I love how Eugene unintentionally completed his "Six the Musical" reference with the  beheading of his cake topper 😂
I don't get the comments complaining that Eugene placed higher than Keith. The producers should've prevented anything poisonous from touching the food. They've had things before where they stopped people from accidentally doing something poisonous. They should've checked if the flowers were edible/food-safe before letting him use them to decorate. What would production have done if the judge didn't already know the flowers were poisonous and they all ate the cake? You can't blame Eugene when he would've legit had to request the flowers for decoration, so they had plenty of time to make sure everything was safe before he even started making the cake.  I 100% appreciate that they didn't allow something that production should've prevented to impact his scoring.
Lol my brothers favorite cake since he was a kid was DQ ice-cream cake and his wedding in September that's what we had and it was great.  I was actually a baker at an artisan bakery for 6 years and did cake decorating for 3 years and I appreciated that they were just like no we want this because some of the wedding cakes I had done were just stupid to make and the simplicity was refreshing.  I would have made one for my brother if he wanted but I know him well enough I figured he wanted a dq one.
I love how Zach learned so much from Jonny's videos and Jonny being so proud of him 🥰
“Today we’re all wide guys. We’re making cakes” LMAO
can't believe we have to wait months for more WAR episodes :((
“Today, we’re all wife guys” made me choke 😂😂😂
Eugene just getting ROASTED by his Mom on speakerphone. DYING.,
Eugene I love your energy!!
Keith acting seriously angry IS NOT funny
5:41 Metallica’s Hell? Why would you want to make a Hell for Metallica, Zach?! What did Metallica ever do to you?! 🤘😈😂
THIS WAS SO FUNNY
I love jonnycakes so much. He is so awesome
"Ooo this looks so bad, my mom's gonna be so mad"  As a fellow Asian, I felt that
So i was confused why Rosanna sounded like she was gonna have a panic attack announcing 4th and then I found out who placed fourth. Rosanna i would also have a panic attack announcing 4th after all the without a recipes you've done ❤
Is Marissa going for the Princess Diana Revenge Dress look during presentation? So fierce
Eugene helping Marissa out and coming up with a genuinely good solution for HER cake in the middle of his stress really warmed my heart. You could tell he was also stressed, but he took the time and came up with something genuinely helpful.
16:27 OSHA has entered the chat
Keith's dress looks great on him.
Johnny’s humor in this episode was perfection… he made me laugh so much
Im gonna vote for Keith.
Zach's little "aw thanks Jonny!" was SO CUTE
Marisa and Eugene make a great combo ❤
But that Stanley Tucci t-shirt is fire tho, Zach
Really loving Marissa more each episode. Please have her on all the time!!
Marissa so fine tho ❤💔💔💔
Zachary!!! 😮😅😅😅😅😅
I have been waiting for a keith blow up meltdown so Im kinda glad he got 4th place lmao
GO FORTH TITS OUT HAHAHAHAHAHA
“Today, we’re all wife guys”. I’m fking dead 💀
So excited for this cake episode! I looove baking cakes!
Iiiii suddenly have a huge crush on Marissa, she looks sooooo hot and powerful presenting her cake wooooaw
as a former baking student this specific episode made me cry. y’all stressing me out (this is my favorite try guys series next to phoning it in)
that dress suits keith so well.
Gonna get "Go forth, tits out" as a tramp stamp 🩷
Me writing a comment about the butter makes the batter better sign behind Johnny, then realizing it's just photo shopped D:
Keith’s reaction was scary 😬
ZACH WAS SO PROUD OF HIS WIFE GUY JOKE
They all look so good
Okay but Keith looks so good in that dress
Throughout this video I just wanted to reach out and hug Marissa
Eugene saying he does like sweet, cute things🤮 Eugene being the cutest, sweetest thing to Marissa is this episode 😍😍
Think of Keith used Gin instead of whiskey it would’ve helped highlight the pine like flavour, his had the most exciting flavour profile to me. Would love to see it balanced properly and bring that pine flavour out!
Keiths face when they announce 4th place kills me
Going absolutely FERAL for Marissa BARK BARK BARK BARK
I love a Capricorn sass
Keith doubling down at the end followed up by the flashback where literally nobody said that Eugene's cake was drier was hilarious lol. Also, I adore Marissa and want more of her in TG videos!
"People eat Barbies for sexual pleasure." "My mother f***ed my world history teacher and now they're married." "I would never, ever say a woman belongs in the kitchen... BUT [context]"  Johnny had minimal to no filter this episode 😂
Marissa is looking so damn hot in this episode.
I appreciate that the guys continue to remind us that Johnny is a LEGITIMATE and AMAZING baker 😂❤
Next season we HAVE TO have The Try Guys Bake/Make Edibles 🍃Without A Recipe
I love that 1.1 Million people hear Johnny and Zach talk about the terms size queen and pillow princess😂😂
Eugene taking the time to calm Marissa  down is so wholesome
24:54 perfect fondant toss
50:44 "I'm smiling because I feel uncomfortable." I'm so glad I'm not the only one who does that.
Watching this, knowing that Rachel often does her own cook in the days leading up to filming so she knows what needs to happen, gives me so much joy.
Did NOBODY notice how after Keith's joke about "Butter Makes The Batter Better" being a slogan on a sign in a mom's kitchen, the video immediately cuts back to Jonny with that sign edited onto the wall behind him? 11:59 I am LIVING for these editing details! Mad props to whoever snuck that in there!
14:40 my favorite moment so far 😂
Eugene biting Keith's flower nearly ended me. Edit: Eugene's mom did end me.
There is like a parrallel between the eugene and marrisa where we see the same things happening to marrissa that happened is the previous cake episode to eugene 😆
I really really love wedding cake. It’s my favorite part of weddings…. And I’m 31. Come at me try guys! Wedding cake? Not just for boomers
I got way to far without anybody mentioning Zachs wife guy comment, absolute killer.
“Today we’re ALL wife guys” ZACH!!! I don’t think that’s allowed!!
Zach was so pleased with his "today we're all wife guys" 😂😂
Marissa looks stunning in that black dress and I love the addition of the black veil!
i used to eat hydrangea petals as a kid
do series with recipe ,
Probably the most fun, wholesome, feel-inducing episodes ever. Everyone needs a friend like Marissa in their lives
Best WAR episode in a long time 😂. So proud of Zach especially!
(Finds out he's in last place) Keith: goes on a rampage
Jonny made this ep for me
“Today we’re all wife guys” the shadeeeeeeeee
Jonny was on one this episode 😂😂😂
so proud of Marissa! and Eugene's mom is just the funniest
Not Zach the whole time saying “it dosent have to tatse good just look good-“ while being the only one making cake the right way 😭😭
Marissa referencing Clair Saffitz is soooo me coded 😭 when I cook I’m very WWCD
I'm so happy for Marissa
I loved the “bake yourself clean” sloagan as a homage 🥹🫶🏼
today were all wife guys LMAOO
Marissa is slaying the whole house down, but she still gave credit to Eugene for his help in making a plan B for the filling, love it  Also tell someone you're proud of them. You see what Johnny said to Marissa warmed her soul, do that for someone around you
Is anyone else picking up the weird mood between Eugene and the others? 😢
I loved Marissa this season she made me laugh all the time.
Eugene's SIX reference came full circle when his cake was done. Divorced. Beheaded. Died.
One of my favorite episodes! From Eugene helping Marissa and her winning in the end to Keith flipping out over losing (per usual)🤣 and then Eugene calling his mom was… icing on the cake (pun intended)!😆
How on earth did Keith make such a dry cake when he soaked it in so many liquids?
aww eugene is so sweet this season.. not just for dedicating things to the women in his fam but like the moment he helped marissa (her gelatin would have for sure ruined that cake haha) and when he thought of the punny name for zach's cake :)
This is the season of Sweeugene
keith's dress fits him so perfectly 🙏🙏🙏
Oh no....the opening already has me doubled over the jokes too funny guys
52:51 don't worry judges, Keith was just being a bridezilla 😂
CLAIRE SAFFITZ MENTIONED NOW LET'S GET HER ON AS A GUEST NEXT SEASON
Really? No one watched their show? I kinda wished they have the liberty to share that to us, here on their channel.
jonny talking to marissa about her cake literally made me cry i'm so happy for her
Eugene was so sweet helping with the jelly 💐
This may be my favorite episode of this of all time!
GO MARISSA I LOVE YOU GOOD JOB CUTIE
I genuinely love when Zach calls Johnny "Johnathon Cakes".
no way marissa won that??? it wasn’t even a wedding cake??
Eugene calling his mum, just for him to get absolutely roasted by her was so goddamn funny. Minyoung, you are a legend! 🤣
Johnny random comments are what I'm here for 😂 they kills me
Everything wrong that Keith said about wood; the branches that he had around his cake were cedar not pine. Also, pine and cedar are softwoods, not hardwoods.
Eugene's pep talk to Marissa is so wholesome and she really needed that 🥹💕
big fan of the editing telling me just how wrong they are
Johnny is such an amazing judge/teacher/mentor!
Zach with the lowkey diss “today we’re all wife guys” 😂😂
I loved this whole episide but all I could think about by the end was how much the neckline of Keith's dress suited him 😂
Marissa hahaha
In response to Marissa, I got a cake that said “Congrats on your breakup!” With black icing and red lettering on a heart shaped cake to celebrate me choosing my well being and myself over a toxic relationship!  That being said, I’d love a series where the judges recreate each person’s foods that they’ve present through WAR!
Eugene mom so cute
Show me Rosanna's DRESS
I love mentor  Eugene <3
This was so fun1
TODAY WE'RE ALL WIFE GUYS NOOOOOO
Keith turned into a Bridezilla 😂
Keith took "mix by hand" very seriously lmao
Living for Marissa's villain eraaaa
the editing team is so amazing - the flashbacks during Keith's judging! I always wonder what the guest judges think when he outdramas the other contestants hahahaha
best WAR ep to date 🥲
jonny is SO funny - the friends comment about his mom ka;skdlfjka;jd LOL
keith looks soooo good in the wedding dress
shoutout to the editors for adding in the "butter makes the batter better" sign to jonnys clips!
MY HEART when Eugene stepped in and helped bring Marissa back on trackkkkkkkk! Amazinggggg
Omg the “Butter makes the batter better, honey.” Sign that was up at 12:08 is so great 😂😂😂
“that show that no one watched” is giving “the year of the gas leak”
Biologist chiming in here: Keith that is a cypress shrub not a pine haha (CUPRESSUS MACROCARPA). **Me googling if it's poisonous - it's not. However it is also not pine 🤣**
I love how Zach kept on talking about Johnny’s baking videos ☺️ shows how he really supports his friends
Everyone looked so amazing during the judging but i have to shout out keith 🥺🥺🥺🥺 the dress fits him so well hes so pretty!!!
Marissa’s unexpected success was so awesome! Jonny’s sweet encouragement to her meant a lot, you can tell!
Marissa looked GORGEOUS during the judging portion omg 🥰
I love Johnny so much. As someone with adhd who accidently overshares or blurt out random facts that can sometimes be a bit too raw and then go “oh, maybe I shouldn’t have said that 😮” I really feel for him. I love his personality, he is so kind, fun and lovely all around. And this was an amazing episode 😊
Zach’s hair looks super full!
lol I tried on keiths wedding dress when I picked mine
Edit: at 43:38-ish, Jonny said "Un-floor-tunately" and no one, not even the subtitles, caught that. 💀 43:23 "Oh, we just love floors!" I dated a guy who worked construction and he constantly--CONSTANTLY--talked about the flooring in any room or building we entered that had hardwood. He would also talk about the way it was laid out and whether it was done by professionals or not. He was always looking at the quality of wood flooring. At some point, I recognized approval when he put his hands on his hips, look around the floor, and nodded. It was bizarre. Nice guy though.
Ummm is Eugene like freakishly tall and I never realized? Or is Marissa freakishly tiny? The pan out when they were standing next to each other suprised me.
I love this video so much omg, no words to describe
I love how happy the guys seem this year! Especially Eugene! Keep up the great work you guys do!!!
The editing the last several episodes has been fire! 🔥 They are crushing it!
Keith does the symbolism of the bridezilla. Someone plz use him as part of a thumbnail of bridezilla video!
So I'm just in the beginning, and so far Keith's "stair' cake seems the best plan if he makes two identical sheet cakes, then cuts 1/3rd from one to make the high and middle step. What could go wrong? Also glad to see a Try Gal in the mix! (omigod, kneading cake batter in a dish tub 😱)
Marissaaaaa 🥵🥵🥵
I think I love Eugene's mom.
"today we're all wife guys" 💀 I SCREAMED
Missed opportunity: Keith should have worn his bell dress.😂😂😂
At first i thought the disco ball was a turtle 🐢 😂
Amazing episode 🥰
BAKE🕺YRSELF🕺CLEAN🕺
Just one word - Dalek?
I like how they didn't acknowledge the fact that someone knocked over the vase all over the front of the table and had to remove the table cloth for the last cake
WTF is wrong with Keith?? Why on earth has he decided that his shtick, as a physically imposing man, and as a company owner, should be screaming at people, getting in their space, and 'fake' threatening their jobs when be isn't given unearned accolades? Oh haha, watch Rosanna laughing at how uncomfortable she is announcing his loss, and how all the judges are feeling clearly uncomfortable as he stomps around yelling, refusing to listen even though he is wrong. How funny to watch 'simulated' abuse by a company owner to the people who work for him.   Everyone looks back and says (Red) was full of warning signs of how he talks about his wife on camera, and here is Keith video after video just tearing into people for being ranked in a ranking game. He is the only person who instead of taking a loss gracefully, screams and yells and stomps around. It's honestly gross and getting worse all the time.   I've loved and followed the try guys since the beginning, but if I want to watch men acting like petulant children who 'fake' threaten others and make everyone around them deeply uncomfortable when they don't get their way, I could just watch Fox News or something. Honestly, with all his unhinged (incorrect) screaming, it might not sound too different.
marissa in her once upon a time regina era 😂 loooove her!!!
"TODAY WE'RE ALL WIFE GUYS" 💀💀💀hfjxjdjyjjdjf
The channel improved in 2023
Ok, the fact that the try guys started off baking and cooking downright inedible things (without accidentally full on poisoning it with decorative elements) and have managed to fail upwards into making something recognizable as cake. Incredible.
This was the best without a recipe episode ever
Also Jonny has become one of my favorite judges of all time
Why offer hydrangea's at all then? Seemed like a eff up with the producers...
I loved this season with Jared, Kwesi, and Marissa. They’re all so different and each bring something fun to the show. ZACHS LAVENDER SUIT THO WHAT A FIT
This was the best episode of without a recipe! I was laughing so hard at the end! Johnny was so nice, since he and Rosanna have watched and tasted how the guys grew in their baking talents. Plus how Marissa did so well. Keith was hilarious screaming in his wedding dress! And Eugene's mom's surprise appearance too!
Marissa’s little yay after Johnny compliments the taste is so cute
I was on the fence about Marisa but then I ended up loving her!
haha keith's outburst at the end! I had the same reaction too. I really thought the judges said Eugene's was dryer.
This weeks theme: dumb ways to die cake edition: Eugene: poison Keith: floor cleaner  Zack: micro plastics Marissa: glass
I love how they decorated the set and went all in (in all areas and aspects) for this finale!!!🤍🥂🤍
Seems like the perfect video to brush out my depression hair to! Let's gooooooooooo. *clicks play*
0:32 is nobody gonna say anything about this comment?? 💀😭🤣
Marissa is a legend. Loved the video and, as always, props to the editors. They always make it an Oscar-tier drama
At first glance I thought it was Aubrey Plaza in the thumbnail
Keith rant off screen TOOK ME OUT
i like how zach did it all right yet still came out wrong lmao
Why did I start tearing up when Johnny was praising Marissa's cake omg <3 also Keith's meltdown and Eugene calling his mom were both comedic excellence
Pls do a reverse episode: the „real“ bakers or cooks draw a recipe of ur created things from the without a recipe series. Then they have to improvise and make that dish better (Maybe without a recipe, too) and the try guys judge them. Could be cool and nostalgic. A few creation over the years were iconic. Seeing their come back and glow up at the same time would be nice.  ❤
The third judge is SO pretty. I'm sorry I know that's not what it's about but I keep getting distracted by how gorgeous she is. @_@
Butter makes the batter better was not unnoticed.
Marissa deserves it so much. I would love to watch Jonny teaching them. I wonder what will happen hahaha  Eugene was such a good friend. Love him
loved the little LCD shoutout with zach’s cake :)
Eugene’s mom’s reaction was so Asian 🤣🤣🤣
10:26 Eugene being protective, looking out for kitchen safety!!! I got such a dad vibe.
We just not going to mention how Stunning Marissa looked.
hm not a fan of how keith in his wedding dress in this video is being treated. One second it's a joke and then the next it's not, the Johnny criticizes his cake by saying that a man in a dress is crazy and the cake should be crazy. This isn't a good look guys.
Jonny cannot stop oversharing and I just love him for it
Go forth, tits out.
I just realised how far apart the filming and the live event actually take place
I love when the try guys make each other break
Marissa is definitely most improved
I can never tell if Johnny is exasperated or excited in the intros 😂
Are we not gonna talk about how Keith slays in this wedding dress???
i actually gasped at zach's. that looks amazing, dude. that IS a fucking party on a cake
"Maybe I'll just panick for the first hour and do nothing" - my ADHD ass
Eugene making a poison cake seems to fit so well 😂
"edible" glitter is just non toxic, like it wont harm you as it leaves your body. 'Real' edible glitter wont shine as much and will disolve which is unfortunate for things like this.
LOVE DOESNT ALWAYS WIN AND GO FORTH TITS OUT
This is by far the best and funniest WAR episode. Keith's bridezilla moment, Eugene calling his mom, and of course, Marissa winning with a DIVORCE cake for a WEDDING themed bake-off X'D Amazing. Can't wait for the next season!
Dear Editors: Love the touch of the of adding the butter sign in the back of Johnny :). Don't like the circus music in the background so much. It's kind of distracting and stressful and hard to focus on what folks are saying. Y'all are doing a great job though. This is just my little opinion. All my love!
Seeing Marissa succeed like this I actually started crying. What a great job and way to go jonny for being so inspiring more
That phone call with Eugene’s mom blew up in his face so much lmao funniest moment of this show in a long time
Eugene coaching is the sweetest thing
Zack is definitely winning this one lol
Eugene and Marissa this episode: Love Loses! 💔
Eugene helping Marissa focus and giving her a moment of 'relax and stop and pivot' moment was so sweet and perfect. ❤❤ we love hwlpful sweet Eugene that genuinely saw Marissa crumbling in the moment and was like 'its okay, whats the plan b. You got this!'  And then she WON! I was so proud of her for that! This was an awesome episode!❤
@Kieth 11:56 Betty Botta bought some butter;  “But,” said she, “this butter’s bitter!  If I put it in my batter  It will make my batter bitter.  But a bit o’ better butter  Will but make my batter better.”  Then she bought a bit o’ butter  Better than the bitter butter,  Made her bitter batter better.  So ’twas better Betty Botta  Bought a bit o’ better butter.
Why did no one have the forethought to check the flowers they were putting on the cake?
Just the fact that Keith became a bridezilla was the greatest thing!! 😂🎉
Eugene really wanted to incorporate Six the musical, divorced, beheaded, died
The way Marissa's only goal this season was to beat Zach and she really achieved it even in this episode when Zach was not the 4th place is so funny to me
Jonny is so dashing in that suit ❤
Not me tearing up seeing Marissa win 🥺🤧💓
Why don't people put passion fruit in more baking stuff? They're delicious and complement citrus flavors really well. But then again, I guess they're expensive in western countries.
I had s divorce party with drag queen's.... there was also divorce cake 😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Betty bought some butter but she said the butters bitter if I put it in my batter it’ll make my batter bitter so she bought of better butter better than the bitter butter and she put it in her batter and it made her batter better so it was better Betty bought a bit of better butter and I bet you can’t say that. 😂  Keith reminded me of that
Last comment I promise (or not) 😅 but I’ve gone to 4 weddings this year and none of them had a wedding cake, one didn’t even do actual dessert-they did dessert inspired cocktails. I feel like the trend nowadays has been leaning against a giant cake and having like a dessert table or at most I’ve gone to a wedding that had a mini wedding cake that the bride and groom cut and then they had cake pops for the guests. But even then it wasn’t a big thing 🤷🏻‍♀️
Keith getting owned by the flash back was the best oart if the episode 😂😂
Zach's was the better one TBH. The cake toppers with disco ball heads alone were really creative, then it had disco balls cake pops instead of sugar flowers, etc. Broken heart cakes are nothing new
Keith’s vein popping out while yelling in a wedding dress really is a mood
Hi Jonny's mom and his world history teacher.
MARISSA U R EVERYTHING 2 MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
"Keith is a bride" is an underappreciated Try Guys subgenre
Marissa making me sweat in her dress woof 🤩🤩🤩
OMG THE FONDANT FACE HOW COULD I FORGET!!! Bold of Eugene to even want to use fondant ever again 😂😂
“today we’re all wife guys” okay strong start 🤣😮‍💨
One of my best friends got divorced after a horribly messy divorce process that took three years. (Teen mom, got married because of the baby, guy was a deadbeat father) Of course we had a massive rager to celebrate and she got this bleeding heart cake with his face on it and said “good riddance!” When you cut into it, it bled like a lava cake 😂 I have no idea where she got it from but it was the best cake ever!
The shade from Zach in the intro 😂also...WHY ICE CUBES IN THE JELLY THE BAKER IN ME IS SOBBING
I just bought my ticket to later’s live show AHHHHH I’m so so so so so excited 💚💙💜
My sympathy to you and your family. I know your step dad meant a lot to you.
I love Marissa and Eugene together
eugene is so real for telling her to have a plan B 😫
Wow, very cool! This reminds me of all the young brides and grooms that have been unalived by the isnotreal occupation. They won’t ever get to celebrate their marriages because of colonization and g3n0c1d3. May they rest in peace, free 🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉
Not gonna lie, 23:31 with Eugene helping Marissa through her stress is actually such a sweet moment ☺️
Chandler ❤️❤️❤️ 😢
INCREDIBLE FIRST LINER FROM ZACH
Omg they are getting good at things...
Eugene’s Mom is always a delight and that edited Six poster with her as all the wives made my day
Gin 🎉 amazingly (lol) has strong pine flavor Keith...... Lol soak the cherries in gin next time?
Cedar is not pine, ahhhh and that's also slightly poisonous if you boil it down the first time. Pine needles are generally not, though! All of them are so good! And y'all look great!
Claire Saffitz I hope is proud of Marissa ♥️
Whoever put Keith’s butter quote behind Johnny, I see you and I laughed way too hard 😂
NEVER GET RID OF THIS SERIES
Eugene taking charge in a crisis makes my heart happy 😂
Also..... Me knowing I make my chocolate cake the same as Johnny 😎😎😎😎😎
lmfao NO WAY what a Cinderella story, who would have thought Marissa just had to go to the dark side to win!! lol deserved
Keith sitting there in a wedding dress, holding a red rose while expectantly looking at the judges with big eyes and a big smile, is somehow reminding me of Sid from Ice Age. 😅
The Pass It On music coming in during Zachs Discake reveal threw me off so bad aha.
Bring Jared or Kwesi back
"Love doesn't always win and go forth tits out" words to live by.
Everything was great but kick Marissa nah y’all did not judge her fair she was judged like if she was a child and the rest were judged so harshly she should’ve gotten last place bull
We love when Eugene helps to guide newbies
Eugene's mum saying 'i don't think you have much of a talent for cooking... haha, that's funny! But you have a great talent for eating! Great talent for eating."
Johnny.  Seriously the second I saw you on that first show I KNEW you would go to be someone. Your presence is electric, you're amazingly skilled at your craft, you're funny and very relatable. I am so incredibly happy you found the Try Guys. I believe they are an amazing company that offers individuals a platform to grow and encourage people to do their passion and share it with others.  Welcome to the wonderful land of the internet. I am so excited to see your career take off 🤗 can't wait to see where you go 🎉
everyone was just straight up GAGGED when eugenes mom on camera just told him he had no talent for cooking after telling her he was in a cooking competition
Zach's t shirt 😙💋🤌
12:06 not Keith’s quote making it on Johnnys kitchen 😭
here's a pitch: try guys try video games! I'd love to see them play games like lethal company, phasmophobia, league of legends, etc  also: try guys try writing music (I'm a composer 👀)
Favorite moment 31:25 this whole scene. 🎬 😂😂
Not even a minute in, and I am CACKLING at Zach's comment about them all being wife guys.
I was not expecting that wife guy joke right at the beginning 😂
Did evil Eugene sneak in to put poison on his cake
Dry cake and then you know poison
Don't know why but keith being on the right side and zach on the left is just wrong in my brain🤔
Keith has turned on the dad jokes... and I am amused...
Not to be that guy but daaaang, Rosanna AND Marissa.
COME ON MARISSA!!! Oh this episode and series is so much fun to watch! Thank you!!!
I absolutely liiiiiiiive for Keith’s outbursts! 😂 This one was his best one yet the way he turned into bridezilla and stormed into the kitchen. 52:06 “In this dress! Yeah that’s right Desiree!” Had me rolling!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Also freaking loved that Eugene called his mom!! 😂😂😂😂😂
You can see Eugene's genuine concern for Marissa starting when she broke that power mixer (goodness, that gave me PTSD because of the glass shard flyiing, Final Destination style)
0:31 the noooo in the background 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The moment with Johnny and Marissa was legitamely so sweet I wanted to tear up. And her eyes were like glowing, I really want to see Marissa's baking empiere
Eugene helping Marissa warmed my black little heart ❤
I just realized watching this that I never get annoyed by who is paired with whom anymore because the one who annoyed me is gone. Also, Marissa is amazing, and I want a Marissa and Johnny show now.
I love the faces when they get compliments. It’s like their life depends on it
Love marissa’s flavor combinations ❤
Jonny oversharing is my favorite.
Ngl when Eugene and Marissa said “more is more” i immediately wanted Molly Baz to come join as a judge
Wow it's like Smosh but worse
For as bad a loser Kieth is, he never really plays up his wins
ok so i'm no expert cake decorator, but if i were to design a disco ball cake I would have covered the round part with grey fondant then gone in with a knife or something to create the outline of the squares as an indention in the fondant. and then add glitter.
Keith freaking out is so Keith
please bring johnny more to the without a recipe moree!! i love him so much and it would be funny to have johnny, ro, and josh from mythical kitchen in the same room
marissa deserves to win 🎉🎉🎉
Jonny is the best
love the cut from keith to johnny in the kitchen with "butter makes the batter better, honey" and then johnny is NOT using butter lmao
ITS A GOTHIC WEDDING CAKE!
Jonny having his pansexual ideation through Marissa and her cake is exactly what I needed on a Thursday
Zach addressing Jonny Cakes as Jonathan Cakes is hilarious
The injury risk of that broken glass bowl spinning wildly with Marissa trying to grab it gave me the shivers 🥲🥲🥲
you know it's a good video when i'm 30 seconds in and have already exclaimed ''ZACH!'' out loud
Anyone else remember the episode of Greys anatomy where that guy swallows 10 judy doll heads?? Just me and Johnny...
I really like the neckholder on Keith
One of the highlights of this video was everytime Johnny said something he wasn't suppose to say. 😆
For my wedding we did a sheet cake from Walmart it had a strawberry filling layer that was delicious most people at the end of the night took some of the cake to go.
Zach and Keith’s friendship is my fav thing ever
Enjoying Marissa being part of WAR (without a recipe)
So proud of Marissa. As a pro baker I’m so impressed and was almost crying when they were saying how well she did
They never uploaded the churro final and I’m still upset about it
i looove this line up and panel of judges. i think this is my favorite episode of this series❤
So i have a question for Rachel. What happens to the food these guys make, after the judging?
What kind of cake would you like in your special day? I would love a vanilla blueberry cake with white chocolate doves and cherry blossom designs.
Alright editors… I see you with the Butter Makes the Batter Better Honey sign behind Jonny. I strive to be as good at video editing/ comedy as y’all one day
nahh she teasing me noww
There are not enough comments about Marissa's final look and her win!! She looks gorgeous and that win was awesome 🥹🥹
The way Euegene's batter...undulated? in the mixing bowl was really, really upsetting
So glad I got to be here to see the start of Marissa’s incredible baking career😍😍
I live Keith's temper tantrums 😂😂😂
You can 100 percent use creamed butter in a chocalatw cake there isn’t anything fully against it and if you don’t you can sometimes almost make brownies but to each there own ofc but ya
Jonny in the tux. Yes.
Tsundere Eugene moment, "Put your hands up!" "I've done that before." 👏
This was such a wholesome episode (even with Keith’s bridezilla meltdown)! I’ll be coming back to rewatch this one when I’m feeling down.    I just went to my best friend’s wedding and I agree with Eugene. The only ones who complained that the catering company didn’t cut and distribute the cake were the people who were not up dancing the whole time which was majority people over the age of 40.   Funnily enough my sister and I were the only people other than the couple that got to try the cake cause we were the only ones to stay and help clean up the next day.
I love how cutesly toxic Marissa is 😂
It's been a while since every one's recipe had positive reviews from all the judges, despite the mistakes... This was great, congrats to Zach for showing so much improvement, and to Marissa for such a good cake!!
Everything about Marissa is amazing, on every level. Her wit, her drive & ambition, her quirkiness...all of it.
I keep thinking there meaning this ep is the live
I love Eugene’s subtle reference to Jimbo - “It’s OUR special day!”
johnnys apology after saying something out of pocket and then being filled with anxiety to the point that it is all you can think about and have to make sure that the group that it didn’t land well doesn’t think that you are psychotic is so real
Jonny is legitimately always so awkward and wonderful, i love him so much 😂
No one commenting on the shade Zach THREW when he said "today, we're all wife guys" at the beginning LMAO 💀💀💀
Eugene is so nice to Marissa, I love that, I love him
Is last year’s WAR live on YT?!
Dayum! Dude I wanna eat that Divorce cake!
Everyone handled the glass smash so well damn I would’ve been screaming and crying
Absolutely LIVING for Eugene calming Marissa down and helping her out. We love you, king 👑❤️
Ro looks stunning!
I think they should have given her more time after her bowl broke. It’s not her fault they’re using those stupid glass bowl. If they had the classic metal bowls that never would have been an issue
omg the sign edited in behind johnny sent me💀11:59
Zach’s wife guy line 😂😂😂😂 dead I’m absolutely dead 💀
Keith's angry tantrums are getting old and annoying. That segment went on way too long in an otherwise great episode.
😂 12:07 I love how they actually made a sign of what Keith said 😆
Keith is literally mixing his batter by hand hahahahah
I love the try guys so much but I'm really, really over seeing Keith throw a hissy fit every time he experiences even the SLIGHTEST criticism or rejection, it's at the point where I skip the judging portion because watching him react gives me anxiety
23:10 and THIS is what friendship looks like
Keith going full bridezilla is my spirit animal ❤
This was one of the best without a recipe's. It really felt like a tough judging for me since everyone made something really great (and edible).  The judges did a great job.
I think I must be getting my period, because Marissa's intro to her cake made me cry
Keith's freakouts during WAR are so funny!!
"I went for like an Old Fashioned and fLoOoOR"
So funny when keith reacts badly when he losses
Of all ppl Eugene giving baking advice killed me 😂
i love that eugene’s reaction to marisa being divorced  was the same as mine 😂
eugene’s mom is such an asian mom
People swallow Barbie heads?  Barbie heads are pretty big 🤢🤮 and that plastic hair strands 🤮
Marissa ❤. I love her and she is so sexy here and Puerto Rican!  And talented... I'm smitten ha. Loved this episode completely
17:39 BERRIES AND CREAM BERRIES AND CREAM IM A LITTLE LAD WHO LOVES BERRIES AND CREAM UP THE OCTAVE 😂
Had to comment for the algorithm because these series are my fave! It gets better and better every year 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Damn I have no idea why but I'm just realizing how hot Marissa is Holy shit
“butter makes the batter better honey “behind johnny 😂
Watching this made my tummy drop 😂
유진아 한복 잘 어울린다!!!
Eugenes mom:  "Thats funny"  Me: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Keith being a bridezilla is typical and I’m here for it 👏🏽
Marissa is giving Elizabeth gillies and she ate
I want Johnny to be my best friend  🥺🥺🥺
Eugene's cyanide (hydrangea) cake looks fabulous for a non professional cake baker.
“Today we’re all wife guys” 🔥🔥🔥
Johnny is being such a good and encouraging teacher for them
Keep wedding dresses away form keith at all time. It trully brings the worst in him.  🔔🔔🔔 To bad he dint bring the bell dress.😅
I hope this like alters the course of marissa’s life-FOR THE BETTER
this was such a good episode omg
The way Eugene console Marissa while she was panicking is really cool. I almost fell in love with him
Love how Keith turned bride-zilla in the judging phase 😂
I love this series in general but this episode was a legitimate Peak to the whole thing. Every single segment was SO good. Zach was impressive getting all of the ingredients perfect and the design concept/lore was comedic. It's sad that Keith's turned out poorly but every intent behind it was incredibly innovative and interesting to watch his thought process. Eugene's was chaotic as always but becomes its own masterpiece in the end; and as others pointed out, iconic that it was partially poisoned to boot. The bit with calling his mom was somehow the right kind of insult to injury. There's really not enough words or time to go on about how impressive Marissa was from beginning to end and how happy I am for her well deserved win.  The support everyone gave each other was nice to see as always but we can all agree that Eugene fully saved the day with Marissa. I believe that she unfortunately would have been worse off in standings without the boost of the jam, especially if the other 2 weren't so dry. The production of this episode was seamless and had me belting out in laughter at times, smiling throughout otherwise. Great job to everyone involved honestly!
I want Marissa's "Go forth, tits out" tattooed across my chest
Rosanna was nervous bc she had to tell Keith that he was 4th 😂😂 not because she didn’t want to disappoint anyone
Keith always gets played in these without a recipe videos and it really pisses me off.
I love Johnny and his commentary.  This is one of my favorite series you guys do.
zach looks like such a homosexual with his lavender suit and im here for it
Are we not going to talk bout Zach's cake looking like a Dalek?
I hope Marissa will be back in more videos, she's amazing!!!!! ❤
Can we get more of Eugene's Mom? She's comedy GOLD.
43:17 "this would be for a couple that loves floors" took me out!
Why do i have a feeling that eugene's and mark's moms would get along on sheer savagery alone.
...When was "Zach is a pillow princess" established??
Did I miss something? In the beginning didn't they say Jared was back in the kitchen too?
I want Jonny's chocolate cake recipe! I feel like I could probably watch his segments and get it, but also my attention span is not conducive to that type of activity 🤣 it looks so good
I love when Keith loses 😂
Marissa is sooooooo hot! Holy shit, his loss girl
this episode is my favourite. i love the thumbnail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bridezilla Kieth
I want all of Marissa’s socials immediately. She’s awesome.
Eugene completes his mom's Six the musical experience by having the groom in the topper 27:30  beheaded!!! 😂
🥺🥺🥺 so happy Marissa
MAKE JOHNNY THE MAIN JUDGE NEXT SEASON!!!
hahaah I love that Johnny had a sign in the background of his kitchen with 'butter makes the batter better, honey'
Johnny saying anything is everything to me 😂😂😂
I’m so happy for the winner! Also how did Keith during his rant not bring of the fact that Eugene LITERALLY poisoned the judges💀
Butter makes the batter better honey sign appearing in the back is brilliant.
Keith breaking down and gaslighting everyone there hahahah
Yayyyyyyy
I'm from the south, and we put mayo in our chocolate cakes so they are not dry. From my mawmaw to your kitchen. Mayo is the way to go. 😊
when Eugene broke the head off the wedding figure all I could think about is the six reference he made earlier.... he said she had divorced and died.... looks like beheaded is shown on the cake.. a true queen
Ok, Keith's fondant looked incredible!
So Zach made a Dalek wedding cake? 😂
Eugene not getting last place even though his cake is poisonous... what...
Eugene's momma ROASTING him had me howling.  And so happy Zach got second place!
I love Keith's rant 🤣🤣🤣
"today we are all wife guys" LMAO ZACK
Zach’s lavender suit is amazing!
"In that dress??" "That's right, Desiree!" My new favorite answer ever xD
Getting third place with a literal poison cake is WILD.
Instantly one of my fave WAR episodes!!!
Zach has done really good the last couple rounds it's so nice to see
I love that there's basically a mole judge now when Jonny is on the panel. He was so supportive of everyone and seemed so genuinely excited and proud to see Zach learn and grow as a baker TT___TT What a sweetie. And absolutely unhinged which makes it better
I think fondant-covered and decorated cakes look extremely unappetizing, but dang was it fun to watch them make these!!
Now this channel promote divorce
I hate to admit it, but i missed Keith raging..
it would've been cute if keith's cake had red carpet!!
also gotta take a moment to appreciate how ADORABLE keith looked during the judging. like when johnny said there was a beautiful man in a wedding dress in front of him @43:31 he was not kidding! such a sweetiepie
I love Eugene !!!
That dress looks so good in Keith
loving the Chandler reference
Omg xD i am laughing. Cat stairs 😂
where were the cute animals ?? great video but I wanted to see penguins in love or something
Marissa looks SO GOOD in that "little black dress"-style outfit with the slicked back hair!
What Eugene's mom said about him having a talent for eating is so Asian 🤣🤣
Omg when Eugene called his mom...STRAIGHT UP ASIAN PTSD 😂 "you have no talent for cooking...you have talent for eating" omg I love it 😂 reminded me of my mom sttaight up
Keith can be scary
Marisa has completely won me over. New Try Guy (Gal) just dropped
I miss the try guy shows that had them trying different things like high heels, drunk while driving, wedding dresses, etc. so many baking shows that they all seem to be the same now. I still really enjoy the baking shows.
I can’t believe they didn’t give Eugene last place when he literally made poison 😭
I damn near teared up when Johnny was talking about his own divorce cake and when he said that he sees the same thing in marissa that someone saw in him this whole damn video got me choking up🥺
Ive been looking for a comment on this but my goodness when Keith had his moment after getting last place, hearing desiree say "in that dress?!" Was so damn funny i lost it😂😂😂
Nicole came to judge for the best episode since everything was edible lol
Really amazed with the way eugene calm marissa down . Really touched my heart. That's exactly the way i want someone calm me down
"Today, we're all wife guys." i actually chocked omg 💀
The comments in here are so unhinged I laughed my lungs out 🤣
Zach’s opening was too hilarious! 😂
I love how Eugene helped ground Marissa as she kinda panicked. Really indicative of strong character!
The butter makes the batter better honey poster while Jonny was cooking 😂 12:06
Shoutout to eugene with the Jimbo reference at the end!
48:35 this is so wholesome im so glad  this season introduced me to marissa more!
The best episode so far. It was chaotic, wholesome, funny and you all looked stunning!!!
JONNY'S FACE DURING ZACH'S PRESENTATION LMAOOOOOO
seeing zach actually progress and learn is so good!
Petition to make jonny a try guy! Love him 💯
When Nicole answered Eugene's what would my mom say question with "you still did a good job" my entire being laughed thinking hell nah she's an Asian Mom. No way she'll ever say that. And then the phone call😂😂😂😂😂😂
OK I am BIASED towards Johnny. I simply adore him.  1. I know when he mentioned Zach was a SIZE QUEEN ,but when did he mention Zach was a PILLOW PRINCESS? Can someone help me?  2. 39:03 Johnny is doing Zach's typical adorable pose. hahahaha. It has rubbed off on him .
Only Keith could compete in a cooking show with literal poison and somehow still rank lower than it. It's hilarious.
I really like that they have more of an idea about how to do it, trying tips they have seen online :)
As someone who had ruined many a pancakes from adding a tad too much baking powder, my jaw dropped when I saw how much Eugene and Keith added Edit: I'm very surprised that the baking powder didn't seem to affect the taste! Though, thats probably because the flavours aren't vanilla
Why does Eugene's cake give me "I unalived my husband" party...
Okay, I have a suspicion they make the expert video after the chaos videos, so that Rachel can ask leading questions like "what would happen if you used a gelatin filling?" based on what has already been done.  What do you think?
Its been said so many times but it bears repeating... It warms my heart to see ppl helping each other, especially while still in competition. Keith helping Jared in the Oreo vid and Eugene helping Marissa in this episode was the absolute kindest. Like those are the reasons i keep coming back for the WAR challenges
why do people always go so crazy with baking soda
Love doesnt always win, go forth tits out 🤣
Keith wearing a wedding dress was the PEAK of the video. Then going bride-zilla on the judges 👏🏻❤️😂
The “Oh, Keith…” , I felt that in my soul
I want the stanley tucci t shirt zac is wearing
not keith accidentally making a creepy pasta cake lmao. stairs in the woods????
I love how zach skills improved a lot
Johnny can NOT shut up about crazy stories 😂😭😭
I'd like to see markiplier Eugene and both their moms on call for a video😂😂😂
This is the most wholesome Without A Recipe season ever - everyone’s helping each other to win or encouraging each other to mess up 🤣
My mom loves sand  Yayyy she won !!!  And also look tf good  😂Keith
Eugene is so nice and so hot... I forgot how nice and how hot since he's been such a rare pokemon lately
Been watching this series since the beginning and it honestly warms my heart and makes me laugh every year. Thank you all for making the holidays feel special 🎉❤
Oh Keith..😂😂 "STOP, Get away from me" welcome to parenthood. You will be saying this many more times throughout life with kids 😂😅❤ congratulations being a parent is truly a blessing experience ❤
I adore Johnny being a part of the Try family!!!  Plus points for Zach for coming on leaps and bounds with his cake baking skills.
I hope Marissa is able to spend some more time baking! Great professional opportunity.
“Today We are all wife guy” 😂 I can’t. Love all of them so much ❤
The pride of Jonathan's face as he was smelling and eating Zach's cake and it was, for once, actually edible. He seemed completely willing to ignore how dense it is.
lmao the "butter makes the batter better honey" sign in chef cakes kitchen
Keith turned into a Broomzilla😭😭😭
Eugene’s mom 😭🫶 “I don’t think you have much talent for cooking. You have great talent for eating”
Marisa looked GORGEOUS in this omg
That's not pine, it's juniper
keith’s breakdown in a wedding dress is so iconic
oh my god im soooo proud of marissa!!!
Eugene’s mom is hilarious
as a korean myself, that phone call with eugene's mom was the most korean thing ive seen
I usually hate puns but i fucking love Keith’s stairs joke😂😂😂
So, that's definitely a lemon lime cypress (not edible, but not toxic) and not a pine 😂😂 I'm not surprised Keith's cake doesn't taste like pine
Marissa in her revenge fit gives me Aubrey Plaza vibes, Puerto Rican queens 💅🏽✨️
I love Eugene giving Marisa a helping hand! The try guys & crew are always so humbly nice & caring ❤
THE WAY JOHNNY HAS NO FILTER LMAOOOO
44:08 BAHAHAHAHA EUGENE NO 😂🌹
This episode was gold. I’m SO HAPPY that Marissa won, I was really rooting for her!! And Eugene calling his mom was HILARIOUS! Also the little rewind for Keith, the Editors really went off this episode. Probably one of my favorite WARs to date!!
In the judging Marissa’s look is giving Elizabeth Gillies as Fallon Carrington from Dynasty😍😍
Whovians out there: Does Zach's cake remind you a bit of a Dalek? 😄
ZACHARY WITH THE WIFE GUYS OHMYGOD!!!
Eugene’s pep talk to Marissa warms my heart. I can feel her panic and Eugene made her feel alright and calm. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
00:25 "Today, we're all wife guys" BAHAHAHA ZACH
i feel so proud of marrisa girllll
I seriously can't tell if Keith was acting like a bridezilla on purpose of if he genuinely tried to gaslight everyone.
OMG please bring her back next year!!! She’s SO CUTE 🥰🥰🫶🏻✨
11:56 That transition was so clever! Nice touch, whoever edited that in.
HAHAHA you know Zach was mentally preparing to say it but still couldn't contain his laughter after he said "wife-guys" but the saltiness of Keith and the roast of Eugene are to die for going forward
26:32 “my mom’s gonna be so mad” has me CRYING
Johnny hyping up Marissa was so sweet 😭😭😭. Would love to see a video with Marissa in the future like "try guys try pastry school" or "try guys try running a bakery"
I love love love love love Jonny. I think he does SUCH a good job judging and hes so funny. And I REALLY loved seeing Eugene in these past couple of videos. His little moment with Marissa was so SWEET.
I laughed so hard at the replay!!! "I feel like this is drier than Eugene's" HAHAHAHAH OADFJASPOFIJASPODFISA
I love Eugene and Marisa as a team 🙌🏻
Eugene’s hanbok is lovely!!! 🇰🇷
Eugene accidentally poisoning the cake omg 😂😂😂
I love that Johnny is OFFICIALLY the guest baker 😭
And also Zac's disco wedding cake reminds me of Beyonce's album Renaissance
Good job Marissa. Eugene the divorce prevailed! 24:00
millions of episodes of this show & Eugene’s mother drops the funniest bit of it all casually on speakerphone 😂
keith yelling about what place he got while in that dress is so funny lmao
I love how cooperative this episode was
Marissa needs to be back she’s amazing and so entertaining
Today we’re all wife guys💀💀
More Marissa!!! I love her!!!
Keith’s breakdowns are hilarious
zach's hair has been looking so good lately
eugene : "look at me"..am in tears 23:12
This was so fun 😂
MARISSA is my FAVORITE. MORE MORE MORE MARISSA! The BEST Try Guy!
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😅😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😅😅😅😅😮😮😮😮😮😮😊😮😮😅😊😊😅😅😊😊😊😊😅😅😊😊😊😅😊😊😅😢
jonny actually just makes me so happy like i feel it in my chest.
If I had two nickels for every time a try guys contestant learned they could have a natural gift for baking, I’d have two nickels
I want Zach's shirt of Stanley Tucci :O It's amaziiinnnggg!
Keith took “mix by hand” very literally
i'm so sorry you've been cancelled 🤗
Not keith being a Bridezilla at the end 🤣🤣🤣👰🏻
Was looking it up - and dam hydrangeas are metal, they’ll mess u up bro
I love supportive Eugene 💗
I might be wrong but I feel like this is the first time a non try guy has won without a recipe!  And well deserved ❤
Oh Zach. The ultimate burn within the first 40 secs. OMG 🔥
Was that Pirates of the Caribbean music?
I went watched Without Recipe Birthday Cakes, right after this to gauge their growth and WOW! Their wedding cakes were all good. Their birthday cakes scared Roy Choy so badly that he never came back 😂
What i didn't realise up until this point. The editing is absolute peak this season. So subtle, so great accents. Thanks for all the hard work to all editors!
Imagine being the loser who fumbled MARISSA she’s a queen what a loss
Lol omg my grandma said the butter thing!! My mom and I quote it whenever we bake.
Small detail but whoever made the label with bubble letters for Marissa’s  frosting, that is so cute❤
Eugene's pep talk to Marissa was the warmth I needed today. And Marissa's cake was so cool! I'm so glad it came out tasting good! Warm Eugene, Marissa slaying, Zach making aparty cake, Keith making... Stairs? What a fun episode. Congrats to Marissa!
I’m only three minutes in but I hope Eugene gets invited to a gay wedding
i'm always sad when we get to the season finale cause i never get tired of watching this ! best show frrrr
WHEN EUGENES MOM JOINED IN AND SAID "I don't think you have much talent for  cooking" that was a harsher critic than the judges ever could bro the Asian in me starting crying (I legit shed a tear)
I've been to a gay wedding! All the male guests were literally sobbing...the couple is divorced now.
Marissa: *panicking* Eugene: I've done that before!
Keith going bridezilla when he got his results was hilarious 😂
ZAAACCCHHHHHH IM SCREAMING its been :30 -  there was no way of escaping this one omg
this was one of the best episodes of without a recipe by far
Eugene has such strong Sagittarius energy (I know hes not) and it baffles me. I love him so much. 🥺🥺
Eugene’s mom is killing me lmaoo “you’re not very talented in cooking—oh that’s funny”
I think this was one of my favorite episodes! The salt at the very start of “we’re all wife guys today” to everyone’s ideas and executing them so incredibly well and showing their growth in WAR, Eugene’s connection with Marissa, the outfits, the vibes, and me leaving genuinely hoping Marissa starts a baking show. Good work!!
Yasssssss! I am living about the winner! Well done!
10:15 oh heck yeah\o/ Clair’s cooking videos are amazing ✨✨✨
How did she guess stairs??? 😂
I am gay, I have never been invited to a gay wedding and I KNOW my gay friends have been getting married. Am I not good enough for their gay weddings? Do they think I’m too fat? Or don’t want to confuse their families because I’m trans but can’t afford to get my tits chopped off? Are they worried about if I’ll be uncomfortable when I eventually get misgendered? I don’t know but I DO know I’m overthinking this. Also WOW, they’re really improving, everything was edible except Eugene’s but that because it was poisoned but it but not inedible because of bad taste!
Marisa got married at the same age I am now…. I live at home with my mother….. and am very VERY single
Anybody watch these and think these adults have no type of basic life skills
OHH THE SHADEEE WE LOVE IT
Eugene /I/ eat the cake at weddings! I love cake. I will always eat cake. I am only 24 and will eat all the cake
54:45 Well. That makes me feel better about my relationship with my mom. 400%
The shadeeeee at the beginning😂😂😂
Bridezilla Keith so good
Someone should have checked if the flowers used are food safe …
Keith is such a bridezilla 😂😂😂😂
Obsessed
Keith and Eugene, the dry guys
Jonny is so sweet and supportive! ❤
To whoever screamed “IN that dress!” Thank you.
Marissa might be my favorite new part of this channel. She’s effing hilarious and beautiful.
There are so many things I adore about this episode. Everyone dying of laughter when Zach said "we're all wife guy today", Zach correctly remembering Johnny's tiktoks and getting the perfect dry ingredients measurements, Marissa mentioning she watches Claire Saffitz, Eugene's big brother energy with Marissa (telling her to lift her hands up when the mixer bowl broke, and helping with the plan b for the filling), Keith in the wedding dress, Zach's beautiful cake, Johnny hyping Marissa up with her cake skills flavor-wise and decorating, Rachel telling Rosanna she's got this when announcing 4th place, Desiree saying "in that dress?" to Keith when he went to complain to the kitchen, Eugene calling his mother! It was such a rollercoaster ride and a perfect finale!
I love how Marissa keeps saying I just want to beat Zach in almost every episode she's in.   Then this episode she still did beat Zach but won too! 🎉
Cake freak out sequel
Keith that’s not from a pine
TO DAY WE'RE ALL WIFE GUYS  the audible "oh no!" in the background hahaha
Anyone notice they edited in a “butter makes the batter better honey” sign in behind Jonny after Keith’s joke lol  12:05
Johnny’s cake daddy support for Zach was too cute
So proud of Marissa! I cried omg we love you
Kieth, love you bro. gotta learn to take criticism
I am so proud of marissa after last week's episode! Actually I am so proud of ALL OF THEM. Even keith did a pretty good cake compared t what we've seen on this show!!
does anyone know why zach starts snapping his fingers as marisa tells her story? around 45:10
Keith essentially told the judges his cake should taste like an old fashioned floor. 🤣 (I know he meant an Old Fashioned drink and, well, floor. But still.)
Keith has me pissing myself constantly
the way eugene's mum nearly stole the show and she wasn't actually even in the episode lmfao icon
"Butter makes the batter better" sounds like a tongue twister/theatre kid vocal exercise hahah Also I am LOVING Eugene and Marissa. Their energy is ✨exquisite✨  Also also I'm crying at what Johnny said to Marissa about her cake 🥲
Before I watch, did no one really eat Maggie’s bitten wedding cake? That can’t be fr right? I’d eat tf outta some bitten cake lmfao
I’ve been married 16 years and all 16 I’ve sworn if I ever have to do it again, I won’t. But if someone holds a gun to my head, I still won’t. Why do I now want to create an entire vow renewal so Johnny can make the cake?
I love keith going dramatic at the end of every judging session😂😂. Adds fun to the video. Just cant stop laughing.
Oh my gosh why did I tear up when Johnny was telling Marissa she did a good job? 😅😂
Eugene wins before I even go on in the episode... even the poisonous teirs... fuckin hell ya man. As a widow and jus generally a demon ... this cake is a banger. And it's beautiful af. Good job man
I love Marissa so much glad to see she won and I hope to see more of her in the future 🫶🏼
What a really wholesome episode ❤ so proud of Marissa!!! Jonny complimenting her made me so emotional for her 🥹🥹
I couldn’t with Keith and his rant 😂😂
😅 zach with the nedit 💍
I am so proud of all of them♡ they have grown so much and all their cakes are edible and not having averse reactions to the cakes. I think they are all doing so well.  I honestly hope next season we get team without a recipe and they switch to a new partner every new episode and whoever has the most win points gets to battle single handedly against the other who is closest to them ♡♡
you can see the moment Eugene heart broke when his mom, said he didn't  have talent to baked. It was funny but  it was such a kind thing for him to dedicated the cake to his mom.
I'm so happy with everyone in this episode for all different reasons.
The writing on Marissa’s Icing at 18:35 so cute
Marissa was amazing and i rewlly would have killed (hehe) for a bite of that cake
12:00 Keith did not!! the sign behind Johnny lmaoo
So SortedFood's pass it on music happened during Zach's cake reveal, Rosanna Pansino was on one of their advent episodes; Try Guys x Sorted collab?? Also so incredibly proud of how far they've all come and today's episode was *chefs kiss*
Who else wants Ann Reardon to watch these WAR episodes and judge the cakes?
Kieth turned into Sydney from the bear 😭
Please everyone give it up for the set team, because as soon as Keith says "Butter makes the batter better honey" is a sign that would be in a mom's kitchen, my eyes legit zoomed in on the next shot with Jonny and that exact same sign behind him 😂 Bravo team, BRAVO 👏
I love Johnny's insight! His advice for Keith was very good Also, he's a cutie patotie
Eugene helping Marissa out with her gelatin issue was so freakin' sweet and kind of him. We love supportive friends! <3
"On that show nobody watched" Eugene saying solidifies my guess that one of the announcements is a new Network show.
How does kieth loose to poison 🤣
Putting Keith in a wedding dress so he can be a bridezilla is inspired
Jonny is so sweet!! I wanna be friends with him!!
I am amazed by Keith's cake 🍰 is gorgeous, it's minimalist and clever design
Zach could have named his cake PartCake so you can partake in the party
keith saying “sorry you’re cancelled” had me rolling😂😂
Y’all should’ve brought kwesi instead of Marisa 😭😭😭
marissa doing the lemon zest with sugar cos claire saffitz did them, icon behaviour
The amount of adds on this video was intense. I had 5 thirty second ads in a row before I was given the option to skip. That’s never happened before. Guess that means you guys are doing well lol 😂
I just signed my divorce papers today and the divorce cake is making me feel so SEEEEEEENNNN <3333 To new beginnings xoxo
I never wanted to give Eugene a hug more than when he called her.
Jonny was so proud of Zach,, super cute!
So proud of Marissa, baking is super hard let alone baking cakes. She really made lemonade out of lemons.
Im finding the name Dis-cake a little too funny istg and the fact that it works perfectly
I'm so glad that (redacted) won, because while they may not have followed the prompt they UNDERSTOOD the assignment
I almost cried when Jonny was telling Marissa she should really look into this as a career and that one day could give him a run for his money. I loved that so much. 💔 💔 💔 move forward- tits out!!  Also pep talk and encouraging Eugene is my favorite Eugene. He didn’t even have to slap her to get her to stop spiraling and focus like in the movies! Just kindly but firmly says “hey- look at me. Come up with a plan b. You got this- I want you to win.”
Eleven minutes in, and I already know this will be my favorite WAR episode everrrr.
The "we're all wife guys" is crazy 🤣 - "BUTTER MAKES THE BATTER BETTER HONEY" IS BEHIND JONNY - I will say that the winner's cake wasn't even considered a wedding cake but they won the wedding cake episode which is swirling my brain 😭
Johnny saying you’ve got a future in baking, and Zach saying she’s not invited back next year 😂😂😂
Zach made…. A Dalek…
It took me awhile to realize that Keith was wearing a dress,  he just pulls it off so well! Jonny does too!
So when does Jonny and Marissa’s YouTube channel launch?!?! 😂 I’d definitely watch them bake together
I was about to comment that hydrangeas are poisonous
Eugene is so nice to Marisa, she should always be paired with him!
DEMONITIZE THIS CHANNEL FOR BEIN GAE
I laughed so hard in the part where Eugene called his mom I'm in tears🤣
Zack deserved the first place
Marissa in that Divorce fit, out here looking like Boobrey Plaza, gahdamn
get jonny on all the things. i just adore his personality!
Eugene helping Marissa with the filling us so sweet omg
Now I’m just waiting for my “love doesn’t always win, and go forth tits out.” Merch
this is my favorite WAR episode now😂😂this was so awesome
GO FORTH TITS OUT! 🫡
We can all feel where Eugene’s “love is gross. I’m the dark one” energy comes from when he calls him mom and she says “yeah, you’re not good at baking. You’re good at eating, and I’m proud of you for that. … hahaha, that’s funny!”
Oh noes, not wife guys...
Jonny is so cute and nice with them and he looks so good in the tux!!
How can she be the winner! One of the criteria was totally ignored! They agreed it wasn't even a wedding cake!
marissa i am in luv with u!!! T*TS OUT FOREVERRRR
“You’re cancelled I’m sorry” 🤷‍♀️ 😅
I LOVE DIVORCEEEEEEE
“I oversaw the process of sourcing it locally” LOLLLLL
Zach & Marissa came from “i just wanna beat zach” to being at the top 2
shoutout to whoever did the little "Bake Yrself Clean" joke on zach's cake cutaway animation 5:41
At this point how do they not know at least one basic cake recipe
I'm so excited for the live tomorrow - but the past two live events I haven't been able to see the Polls to vote at all. Kiswe FAQ and their help email haven't been helpful for troubleshooting why I can't see any polls during the live shows. Does anyone here who happens to see this maybe have any advice or troubleshooting to be able to see the poll for voting for WAR live??
Oh not the six the musical joke, my special interests are colliding
i freaked out when m,arissa won!!
love the “butter makes the batter better honey” sign behind jonny😂
Marissa looks so beautiful during the judging
Johnny looking so hot in that tux!! I love him as a judge!! I love Marissa and Eugene as group partners!!
This TRULY has been the best season of Without A Recipe yet! What an amazing finale, they all actually did amazing! They've produced food that was straight up inedible before and they all managed to make really beautiful good cakes! I am SO happy for Marissa's win, that cake truly looked phenomenal and I actually wish I could have tasted it! I hope this gives her the confidence to pursue cooking or baking on her own because she really does seem to have a talent for it.
Jonny encoraging Marissa and telking she has so much talent is so sweat and great to see, hope to see more work from her
My Roman Empire is that I won’t be able to watch the live 😭
Love when Keith went bridezilla 😂😂
"Today we are all wife guys" "NO"
keith with the bus tub
LOVE THISSS❤
They should do the rice purity or bdsm test with Johnny.
Eugene went full dad voice with advice, fantastic!
Keith’s reaction is always my favorite 😂
Keith in the wedding outfit is serving librarian in a super cute way
No, divorce should not be celebrated just as much as weddings 🙄 🤦‍♂️
Keith actually got robbed, his meltdown was deserved lol. But everyone did do a great job
Omfg im so here for the divorce cake. Thank you Marisa!
Cracking at the “Butter makes the batter better honey” behind Johnny 12:06
Everyone loves how wholesome they are when they’re helping each other, yall should do episodes like the technical challenge in great British baking show! Making something with a pared down recipe but you don’t know what it is! And the contestants often are wholesome and help each other, I think people would love it.
USE ME AS AN I LOVE MARISSA LIKE BUTTON
Rosanna looks so beautiful in white 🤍
I would reaaallyyy love to see Johnny re-make everyone’s cakes
Marissa and Zech going from fighting not to finish last to fighting for that first place...
Marissa lookin so mfkn hot 🥵
Bro that smile from Eugene after johney said the thing about heads was forced as heeelllllll😂😂😂
Eugene's creativity and skills always makes him a contender in all these types of shows. Him saving Marissa just shows what he can do in a pinch.
I love Johnny❤️
I love Marisa’s cake! It looks so good
Opening with "today we're all wife guys" is so powerful....
Literally my first thought when he said hydrangeas was "aren't they poisonous?" lol
I freakin love Jonny! I laughed so hard when he started talking about the kink! Not in like a shameful way but because everyone was so dang awkward!
Not the 'Wife Guys' lmao
Did Keith just throw everything he learned in seasons past out the window? 😂
I just luv alll d cakes n i really luv d creativity dis guyzz brings in the show....Kuddos to all d Hardwork u do in alll d episodes n a huge applause to alll ur efforts irrespective to the ranks u alll r d "WINNER" of dis show👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊❤️❤️❤️❤️
normal  stock footage omg
This was the best!
Pitch: a series where Johnny teaches Marissa baking skills
I did watch every episode of  “that show” they keep talking about and I am so sad that “that stupid person” decisions over shadowed that show with their poor decisions 😢
keith bridezilla era omg
the way that there wasn't even any build up to the baker saying that hydrangeas are poisonous to wedding cakes felt like an anime plot twist
This season of WAR has been so wholesome. Everyone is so supportive and even actively helping each other see their visions come to life.
I loved everything about this season ❤ 🎉congrats to Marisa on her win 🎉❤
Does Keith think old fashioneds…. Have pine?  Edit nvm I get it now
not johnny knocking over his champaign when going to feed keith
I miss the ginger
Just cackling to myself in bed at 1:00am at the reveal of Keith's lumpy wooden footstool -- the most insane color and shape possible for a wedding cake.
12:06 the sign😂
We can always count on Marissa to bring the bratty sass 😍😂😂
51:28 *keith has another cake breakdown* Rosanna and Johnny: Ah shit here we go again
12:11 butter makes the batter better in the background lmaoo
Jonny is everything. Please find any and every excuse to put him in videos and never let him go
Why is Keith’s cake blurred at 27:03 ?
Whoever added that fake “butter makes the batter better honey” sign behind Johnny baking is subtle hilarious
They should probably stop having the "professionals" say "I wouldn't recommend they make x without a recipe". We get it and that's kinda the point.
OH keith is scary when hes mad but MAN that was a blind sided 4th place!!😂😂😂
Any Emma Willard alumnae watching?  Keith looks ready for our graduation ceremony, complete with a red rose and a sparkly tiara headband.
"We're all wife guys" ZACH
I have cupcakes in the oven as I'm watching this
“Divorced, beheaded and died”
Did Keith mix his cake batter in a bus bin? 😳
Love marissa hope she’s back in other videos, idk why I got emotional and she looked 🔥🔥🔥
"Love doesn't always win." I'm an aromantic, and I feel so seen right now.
But wedding cake is the ultimate basic vanilla frosting bitch
Hope I can get an answer, but would be able to see it later on or is it live only, I get out of work late 😢 but I want to see it
I absolutely loved Zach’s cake. Zach, you really killed it.
I died when Eugene called his mom and she roasted him! This was such a great finale!
this phone call with Eugene and his mother must go in the top moments for this season without a recipe! 😂
The shade they keep throwing at a certain former member is entertaining
"Today we're all wife guys"- Zach Kornfeld 2023
These are always the best when Keith loses. He only ever really hears the positives judges say and forgets the negatives by the time they announce the winner.
Marissa really looked like Aubrey Plaza in the thumbnail and now I can't unsee it
“Today we’re all wife guys”within 30 seconds into the video killed me I like how “it” is just a funny little joke now😂😂😂
Marissa we stan
keith is a bridezilla
The way I cackled when Keith exploded!  Keith: “They gave me fourth!” Woman: “In that dress?!”  💀💀💀
we’re ALL wife guys 😂😂
THE END THOUGH KEITH’S REACTION, EUGENES MOM 😭🤣
i’m here for the shade not even one minute into the video 😂 “we’re ALL wife guys” 😭
i wish they wouldn't give the guys stuff that can actually poison people on accident :(
Loved the Eugene and Marissa pairing. 💙❤🥂🍰
Ok but Jonny's comments towards the four of them were so cute and wholesome lol I want a friend like him in life he is so funny and nice
10:26 is that. Tattoo. Eugene?
Guest professional baker judge: *points out poisonous decorations on the cake*Johnny, a veteran WAR judge: Not to be like, condescending or patronizing, but ‘flower juice’ is the LEAST of your worries today, ok?  Rosanna: *WAR war flashbacks*
“Love doesn’t always win, and go forth tits out.” - my new life motto from Marissa
Zach got my like this video 😂
I love how they just completely glossed over Jonny spilling his champagne when he went to feed Keith
Eugene’s mom roasting him then saying “that’s funny” 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Also watching the expert explain what not to do while clips of everyone doing that exact thing will NEVER get old 💀
Eugene is such a nice guy! Cheers friend
Jonny has a point, Marissa made a good cookie on her smore and a delicious cake, maybe baking is sort of a hidden talent for her.
Why is no one talking about the Matthew Perry nod?  This was filmed before he … 😢
Eugene you little sweetheart ❤
keith bringing the bridezilla to the voting segment
IM SO PROUD OF MARISSA!!!! OMG GURL <3
I dry heaved from pure laughter hearing Eugene’s mum talk, tears were also shed when Marissa won 1st place
Marissa is adorable and I love seeing her in random commercials.
We needed the DRAMA of a latina, this is amazing
I’m so proud of Zach.
The "Keith getting mad when he looses" bit is getting old and is uncomfortable to watch.
Ok so after watching this. Is the big ANNOUNCEMENT that the try guys Try throwing a wedding? A Rosanna Pansino & Husky wedding?!? JS
and what are you thinking eugene! you know what your mum would say... she's asian!!!
Also, is this the first black female judge???
eugene's mum saying that he's not good at cooking but good at eating is such a hilarious 1-2 punch
Am I the only one that wanted them to cut into each layer/tier? I know they couldn’t for Eugene’s cause the flowers, but I wanted to see all the colors in Zack’s layers and the steps in Keith’s.
eugene put poison in his cake and still won over keith? justice for keith!! he made stairs!!
Comment on Hughie and why Keith is still collaborating with someone who is a Zionist. Free Palestine
okay Marissa is jaw dropping hot with that ultimate slay divorce look
one thing i love  abt Eugene is that he will deliver with the presentation no matter what
gonna get "love doesn't always win so go forth tits out" tattooed
i saw eugene's hydrangeas i was already like, aren't those poisonous? glad the expert picked that up! (but i also thought eugene was really trying to reinforce the idea of love is a bad idea lol)
Them adding the sign after the butter batter bit
I love Eugene's outfit being crossed to suggest he's dead. I wonder if that was on purpose.
I'm so confused how Eugene managed to get a poisonous flower on his cake when theyv've mentioned before they have someone one these shoots who pays attention to that kind of stuff for them/ makes sure things are safe!
Ngl, of all the side characters that could actually become an official try person, I feel like Marissa is low key the best pick.
Getting ‘go forth tits out’ tattooed immediately
Tag yourself: I'm the knocked over champagne flute
Love doesn’t always win and go forth, tits out. Amen.
I love how Eugene's Mama roasted him elegantly. This episode got me laughed a lot, especially that broken groom's head still being placed in the cake strategically. I love it! Thank you, guys..
Oh eugene wasn't kidding when he said his mom's humour was dry HAHAHA 🤭 I felt his pain-
What cake did Eugene make that no one watched?
johnny stop with the heartfelt compliments. you're making me cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭 CONGRATS MARISSA!!
Love Marissa!! She adds such a balance.
Eugene coming in to help Marissa with the support and then marissa then shouting him out at the judging has rebirth me into a better human being. That was so sweet 😭😭😭
"Go, forth,tits out."😭😭😭 A truly moving experience.
Sorry for your loss Mama Eugene
I love mentor/advisor Eugene.
That Eugene and Marisa talk was so sweet. Also, I love the switch in dynamic between Marissa and Zach vs Marisa and Keith. Eugene is definitely the older brother from the first marriage, and Marisa and Zach are his rambunctious twin half brother and sister.  Then Jonny speaking all that love to her was so sweet. It was just all sweet.
I’m sorry Keith, but it looked like a graveyard to me with those colors. Did not look like steps at all. When Johnny kept complimenting Zach, 🥰. Also, how does Keith look SO good in that wedding dress?!
You can HEAR the pettiness in Zach’s voice about how taste doesn’t matter and only “pretty”dishes work 😂
You could say that Marisa took the cake
I love Eugene's mom
marissa's entire story this episode brought me to tears truly support goes a long way and it is beautiful 🥹
Eugene not getting forth after putting a poison flower on the cake 😮
MARISSA'S WATERY EYES WHEN JONNY SAID THAT TO HER WHILE JUDGING HER CAKE I WAS ABOUT TO START SOBBING 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Keith's Bridezilla mode has been activated.
Keith put on a wedding dress and turned into Bridezilla.
MARISSA SWEEP!!!!!!
46:27 Keith's perfect bride posture every time the camera cuts to the group is SO funny to me 💕
I always Keith to lose just so I can watch him freak out. His exasperated energy is my favorite.
Realized at the end that the live audience might just give Keith last place this year to watch him explode.
Keith as bridezilla is BIG MAD
“ I feel like there’s going to be stairs” HOW DID SHE KNOW
Marissa making a fantastic looking cake, winning first place, and while looking as amazing as she does, she deserved it XD
Eugene's mom roasting him made me laugh so hard lol "that's funny"
Eugene calling his mama was simultaneously the cutest and funniest part. She's hilarious and I love her. 🤣
Marissa's cake was obv the coolest cake. Coulda tasted like hot garbage and it'd still win in my black, broken heart.  Also, gratz to Zach for getting a 2nd. That does not happen often. GG disco dude.
Where and how can I watch last years live show?
From the thumbnail, I thought Marissa was Liz Gillies
Everyone looks so amazing during the presentation
Johnny being so excited and proud is SO WHOLESOME
Johnny saying things he shouldn't, and the judges as a whole being ecstatic about eating something edible on this show was great.
Marissa at the end in that dress is absolutely stunning
I'd like to see a super clip of Marissa making her cake. That was awesome.
Keith. I love you, but calm the f down!
I love Marrissa and Johnny! I just love their energy.
"today we're all wife guys" made me choke, thanks Zach
did anyone feel like there were more ads then usual
Johnny is HOT!!!!!!!!!!
In the thumbnail I thought Marissa was Aubrey Plaza! That's a fierce look.
Why was I expecting a teardrop shaped cake for a 3 tear 3 tier punny cake.
This is some cake slander. My wedding cake was fire 🔥
Not enough people are talking about it but MARISSA DID SO FREAKING WELL! I AM SO PROUD OF HOW FAR SHE HAS COME ON WAR ITS INCREDIBLE!! I was rooting for her the whole time and I was so impressed with how things were going for her, I can’t wait to see her and Johnny host on the live special ❤️
Johnny "wedding cake should be this fluffy, moist, delicious expression of love" me what kinda weddings you been to man? The cakes I have had always been more display than taste.
wdym marissa got married at 24 she LOOKS 24 omgggg
Zach just made guy diamond from trolls
try staff without a recipe when?
keith is so me having my monthly people pleaser snap at work. i feel so seen when i watch him flip out lol 🫶 it
I LOVE KEITHS ATTITUDE THIS EPISODE!!
anyone else think Zach's cake looked like a Dalek?  xD
I gotta say it, Marissa looks HOT in her black outfit DANG GIRL!
😂😂😂❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉I can’t even right now. Hot damn that was great
Eugene is Def Texan.....y'all!
I WANT TO SEE BOTH THE RESTAURANT OWNER AND THE WOMAN WHO MADE THE DIVORCE CAKE TO COME BACK!! i hope they both return soon! loved this video! laughed and replayed a lot!
I love how Eugene had POISON in his cake. But managed to get out of 4th
i love that marissa quoted clair saffitz 🥹
i know this is supposed to be a silly show but cannot tell you how proud and happy i was for Marissa and Zach  also why did this episode got me so emotional, it had so much wholesome energy
I don’t see any comments talking about how after keith says “butter makes the batter better honey,” then there’s a sign behind johnny in the kitchen that says it!!! top tier editing 💯
The “ Butter Makes The Batter Better” sign in the back killed me 🤣 shout out to the editing team ♥️
Keith losing it when he is in last place always sends me now seeing him get up in a wedding dress im pissing tears
Jonny randomly dropping tidbits of way too much information is a vibe. If I had the money I would have him follow me around dropping those bombs all day. So funny!
WAIT WHY IS ZACH A PILLOW PRINCESS?!
I bake a lot and watching Eugene dump the cocoa powder in had me STRESSED😅
the comment about Keith's cake being made for a couple that loves floors made me snort 😆
Eugene was so good at helping Marissa rationalize what to do when she was starting to panic, that was sweet to watch
Between Size Queen and Pillow Princess, I've had to clear my search history twice because of this show.
I simply can not describe how much i appreciate Marissa!
You got to love how somewhat chaotic this without a recipe episode this was. The fact Keith goes off on about how his cake isn't drier than Eugene's instead of the fact he lost to a literal poison cake ,and that Marissa's cake isn't even a wedding cake yet she WON a bake wedding cakes without a recipe challenge. The chaos was amazing
The little like mini therapy session in the middle of marissas
not enough awe at how stunning marissa looked during the judging segment !!!
I'm genuinely so excited for the winner and by what Johnny said that I'm getting choked up a bit, and not by a doll's head! Congrats and I hope the winner keeps baking!
DISCAKE 😂
Keith in a halter top wedding dress has my heart. Especially since he expressed how much he loved the halter top on him 🥹🥹
idk if marissa is a… gay divorcee… but she’s looking fine as hell this episode 😘
Am I the only one a little disappointed that no one really messed up? 😂
"Love doesn't always win, and go forth tits out " 😂 iconic 👏🏻💖
i love when keith pops off...lololololol
The disco cake looks like a Dalek bride fron Doctor Who.
Ya'll listen, I understand the intense hatred everyone has very dry cakes lmao, but I don't know why no one else is talking about the fact that even though Keith's cake migth've been dryer than Eugene's, at least it was fully edible?? My brain can't wrap around the judges deciding a dry cake was worse than a poisonous one, I'm sorry??
Eugene learned from his mistakes and I love it😅
Not zach being like " we're all wife guys" .. THE SHADE
I love Marissa!
14:34 Zach singing Party Rock was adorable 😂
The butter makes the batter better honey sign when Johnny was cooking was top tier editing ✨ 11:59
Jonny in a tux 😍😊
This was one of my favorite episodes of Without a Recipe ❤️ loved hearing Jonny's random stories lol
23:13 Eugene with the "take a deep breath" veteran advice right there, I sat up a little straighter in my chair when he said LOOK AT ME!
Keith is definitely a bridezilla 😅
Will the live stream be available to watch later ?? If we can’t attend the live😢
I played back Eugene biting Keith's rose like 3 times I don't know why that part killed me so bad 🤣😭 and Zach's so genuine "careful that's poisonous"
AWWW I love how helpful Eugene was with Marissa, so wholesome<3
god, I love Eugene man, I really love how he helped Marissa there, like it was really as simple as just telling her to make a Plan B filling but it is still so nice to see him calm her down, and also to show concern when she broke glass and some of it went flying
23:58 I thought Marisa's broken hearts mended after Eugene sweetheart moment.
Omg thank goodness she didn't cut her hands open
Eugene’s mom literally sounds like so many of our Moms that humble us at every turn 💀😭😭😭
i came here to rewatch after the behind the scenes post at Ro's commentary about Eugene's cake and yes you can still hear Jonny drop the groom's head on his plate 33:39
I almost teared up at Marissa's judging and Jonny's kind words ❤ proud of you Marissa
Wholesome
Keith’s rants are my favorite!
Can we get cute little cooking tips videos where Johnny Cakes teaches Marisa (and us) little cooking tricks or something?? I just really hope she keeps baking I love herrr 🫶🏽🫶🏽
"you have a talent for eating" is actually the funniest compliment i've ever heard 😭
Johnny taught me something today about a kink. Thanks, Daddy Johnny! 😂
I’ve loved everyone this season!! Jared, Kwesi, Marisa, and of course all of the judges were amazing :)
the way i screamed at the champagne flute spilling
Marissa was GIVING Elizabeth Gillies with that presentation look, and I'm 100% here for it.
Whooo! 🍰
marissa is sooo funny
MARISSA ATE THAT UP!!!!!! The fit, the presentation, the cake 😍
Love Marisa! She’s so much fun! Tits out bebe!!!
Omg not even a minute in and “Today, we’re all wife guys” 😂😂😂😂 absolutely deceased
Okay, seeing the text on screen that Zach had created a perfect ratio of dry ingredients for his batter made me SO HAPPY! He's come so far! And congrats to Marissa! I'd love to see her take Jonny up on that challenge and start doing some baking! Go, girl!
Eugene’s cake’s colors somehow represent all the three guys (blue purple green) ❤
Not Jonny knocking over his drink 44:35 😭
I love Rosanna’s judging so much
Wife guys!
At 48:13 and I swear to God, if Marissa doesn’t win I’m going to be livid
Eugene being the best hype man for Marissa! Love!
Umm, can we talk about how stunning Marissa looks in that black dress!? The hair? And makeup? Sheesh!!! 🖤
Keith is my favorite loser😅. Nobody has the fourth place meltdowns like Keith. Others have tried but they can't match his energy.
I love marissa to death please make her a regular
One thing Eugene is not going to do is let his friends feel like failures. “I’ve done that before,” are the sweetest words to hear when you’ve made a mistake.
Let's appreciate how well Nicole did cutting and serving the cakes! I was genuinely impressed that none fell and you managed to get all the flavors for each judge. Well done!
Eugene is literally the sweetest ever, omg I'm going to cry
I am a Capricorn and I understand Eugene very well. I understand the complete distraught when you fail at something you are taking seriously. It's easier to just not care, and avoid extreme emotion when expectations aren't met.😅  Also, he went full Capricorn mode when he stopped Marissa, and told her a sound and solid plan. He helped her ease her worries through logic and structure. Absolutely what I would have done. I LOVE MY FELLOW CAPRICORN.  🫶🏻
Zach’s cake also gave me accidental Dalek vibes 🤣
im soo excited for tmrrw but no way kwesi is a judge😭😭😭
9:31 "Get in there girl~" I love Keith 😭💕
Im not used to keith being on the right side.
i love jonny's "fun" facts lmaooo hes a real treasure
"Love does not always win, and go fourth tits out" needs a t-shirt IMMEDIATLY
thank god keith is here making a wedding cake for all us couples out there who love floors😆
Marissa has fully won me over with "love doesn't always win"
Shoutout to Nicole for saving the cast & crew from being actually poisoned 😂
omg I have never laughed so hard at a recent WAR episode as much as this one!!!!  😂😂😂  I am SO proud of Marissa!!! Jonny's comments about her baking were *beyond* touching!!!!!  ❤❤❤  Also.... wow, Keith went OFF in this one, didn't he!!  😂  But Eugene calling his mom was by FAR the most top tier comical thing in this video. I was choking from laughing so much 💀🤣🤣🤣
Eugene calling his mommy bc he got 3rd place lmfao
Eugene calming Marissa was so brotherly. Loved it.
Not even five minutes in and already losing it at Zach's delivery about the previous cake adventures
Lmao Eugene’s mom reminds me so much of my mom! I love her
Marisa is a star!
They should bring Nicole back, she really fit into that judges panel! She seemed really nice😊  speaking of new judges: I always feel a bit bad for them when Keith pretends to be angry when he loses. I understand it's for show, but what if they aren't familiar with him and get afraid of this man being genuinely angry at them😅
Our faces when Eugene graces us in these videos 🥹😍🤩
Yall, Marissa better come back cause i love her
Marissa is a god damned delight and if you guys don't bring her back next season I'm suing
respectfully, marissa tits looked AMAZING in that black top. CONGRADULATIONS MARISSA AND SLAYYYY
I love watchin yall work together
Keith looks like such a cute modern day bride ❤
YESSSSSS MARRISSAAAAAAAAAAA
Jonny is the sweetest, most wholesome person 💛
Keith ducking ate this episode!!!😂
i was at a gay wedding once (a rich one with an open bar might i add)… all the gay friends of the gay grooms came and abducted me as their little lesbian child and presented me forth at the dance floor when britney came on… a vibe, but also overwhelming, chaotic, and yes jonny, honestly annoying
I thought y’all added the glass breaking sound effect but the bowl actually cracked 😭
Eugene is so anti-marriage that he put actual poison on his wedding cake
did i just cry during a without a recipe video? yes! i didn't think i could love eugene more than i already did but MY GOD......i could literally hug him for stopping marissa's spiraling with such care. ive been in her shoes before and i would have killed for someone to care enough to do this for me. good job, eugene!
Eugene saying that Marissa needs an alternative when she was panicking was so grounding. Love to see it.
Everyone is talking about Eugene but I think Jonny was the real star of this episode. How incredibly kind he was to Marissa was truly a joy to watch. She seemed like the weakest link all season but rlly improved so much!! Woo! Go Marissa!
this is now my favorite episode of the series
Was hoping my shirt would arrive  before the end!!!!
Eugene is so sweet. I’ve done that before…. Oh I’ve done that before!” So reassuring to her🥹
What has being a father done to keith's brain, that was pure madness. When Zach is the most sane baker something is wrong!
Eugene finally took revenge for Keith's "you must have been a bad boy that year" in the Christmas gingerbread house episode.
Okay, I officially love Marissa and I want her in every video
Eugene's mom HAS to judge an episode!!
My least favorite part of Without Recipe is back - Keith's temper tantrums. I thought he finally learned to control his anger, but no dice apparently. It is not funny, and I don't understand why so many people like it. Eugene as always is fabulous, and I appreciate his support of Marissa. Jonny is so warm and nice, and I admire Rosanna's willingness to go through Keith's ungrateful fits of anger. I hope someday he will finally realize that grown adults shouldn't behave that way.
Screaming at Keith’s reaction because my goodness hahaha
Eugene helping Marissa was so sweet <3 He went into brother mode
A show where Johnny Cakes teaches Marissa decorating (and/or they team up for baking challenges???) Please & thank you ❤❤❤
I watched the “show that no one watched”🫢watched every single aired episode
I think that the without a recipe contestants should always dress up in wedding finest for judging.
I love Marissa. I will be going forward tits out.
Team Marissa  !!
This episode was great, I had such much needed laughter. Looking forward to the finale!
had no idea who marissa was but i loved her! please invite her back 🧡
I love Johnny so fucking much 😂
Jonny has such a wonderful presence. Who knew someone would talk about vore on Try Guys
Married at 24 and already divorced? And still friends? Well I guess it wasn't that bad of a relationship. Goes to show how quickly people divorce the second it doesn't work for them.  Sad.
I love how much Zach referenced Johnny in his process! You'd think after doing this for so long and knowing all these pro bakers/chefs, they WOULD pick at least a few things up 😭
When I saw hydrangeas in Eugene’s cake I was shocked like Isn’t that poisonous ☠️
Keith walking in wearing that dress and crown made me choke 😂😂🤣🤣 the clipped rose 🌹 was perfect
I love how eugenes cqke was poisonous 😂
I watched the show you guys!!! I did!! LOL
What about Kwesi, how could you forget to include him in the final !
Marissa is giving Trinity from The Matrix vibes and pulling it off. She's a hot tamale.
this is definitely my favorite episode, made me so happy
Can we point out how Eugene unintentionally tried to poison the judges and still beat Keith 😂
great job Marissa!
Keith venting with the singular rose and wedding dress is definition of a woman scorned
I know try guys aren't to blame here, but WTF YOUTUBE. 5 unskippable adds!?!
I love how they're all dressed like they're ready for a wedding, then there's Marissa in all black with her hair slicked back like she's fresh out of a mob movie
Jonny and Marissa having such a wholesome moment and then Zach comes in with "you're not invited back" 😂
I felt so proud of all of them for coming such a long way with baking. They used to make cakes that had the texture of quiche and now they can make delicious wedding cakes. I felt like a proud mom. Loved how Eugene helped Marissa in her spiral as well and it helped her win! Nice Eugene is the best.
This is more edible food than I have ever seen in a Without a Recipe episode...and one of the cakes is literally 2/3 poisonous.
Jonny and Zack have an insane chemistry I can’t even describe it
30 seconds in and Zac making that wife guy joke helped heal my soul
Today we’re all wife guys 😂 absolutely savage
54:19 i am HOLLERING on the floor, eugene’s mom is fantastic😂😂😂
Oh my god I love Marissa so much. She's full of the best and most fun kind of drama 😂
the way eugene asked if marissa was divorced with such excitement is what i love about him
Marisa is wearing a hella hot revenge dress too! Whoever that man was f’ed up!!!
johnny so supportive omg we love
Keith actually looks great in that wedding dress. Werk. ❤
Does anyone know if/where can we watch the previous finale livestream of without a recipe?
I just realized: the colors of the tiers on Eugene’s cake are the colors for the Try Guys, and the only one that didn’t have hydrangeas was the one in Eugene’s color. Coincidence? 😏 Jk!
I love how Eugene hasn't learned that he shouldn't be mixing cake batter for 10+ minutes 🤣🤣 His mom is such a savage - "You don't have much talent for cooking"
I really appreciate Eugene’s “stop, look at me” moment with Marissa possibly the most from this episode
Marissa got them thangs thangin, boy!! 👀🍒
That dress was so flattering for keith!
why does keith actually look amazing in that dress??
omg Marissa at 55:12 is straight up just R2-D2 I'm cackling
Keith going bridezilla was the best rage moment this season, hands down!
Awesome divorce cake Marissa! Love the idea and the judges loved the taste. You should spend some time baking with Jonny! And Eugene, your Mom is EPIC! Keith, you were a beautiful bride and Zach I loved your disco ball! What an episode! LET THEM EAT CAKE!
What I learned today is that Eugene should have used plastic Hydrangeas, Pinesol makes decent cake but you have to really commit and also I love that Marissa's cake won it was so good
Love the Butter Makes The Batter Better sign behind Johnny ❤😂
I love Keith’s eat the menu presenter voice, “the chocolate stairs”
I worked at a restaurant that had a coconut rum cake and I used a spray bottle of rum on each layer lol
i hope marissa comes back and tries her hand at baking. i'm so happy to see everyone shine here. also eugene was so freaking sweet. i really love how much he supported her. love doesn't always win and go forth, tits out!
Marisa looks like lady Gaga in that dress with her hair pulled back
"Today we're all wife guys" I love Zach 😭
Eugene’s mom laughing and then saying you don’t have a talent for cooking and then saying that’s funny is top tier!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Eugene stepping in with the advice and not just focusing on himself is so beautiful. His tone, clear steps on what to do next and suggestive approach shows how good he is in problem solving. He had no issues in Marissa winning ❤ Love him 😊
Eugeane and Marisa together is sooooo good the way eugeane comforts and supports her through out their baking session warms my heart so much. A true friend right there
Eugene's cake, is the pastry version of fugu, which is a dish made out of pufferfish. the middle half, is the safety space, like there's a safety space for pufferfish.
Ugh, Eugene! ❤ So sweet to be the stable rock Marissa needed when her filling didnt set.
Who knew Keith would be a bridezilla
"You know how bees grow things" -Marissa
They robbed Zach of a winnnn
what's the show that Euege made cake for that no one watched?
Eugene literally serves a poisonous cake and still beats Keith. 😂
HOLD UP. At the 35:30 minute mark the theme for Sorted Food’s “Pass It On” series started playing. Sorted just announced a collab with Rosanna… are we going to get the most insane cooking mashup in YouTube history in 2024?
Hey Keith......here's my gramms tongue  twister from like 80 years ago..... Betty Botter bought some butter, But she said, this butters bitter, but a bit of better butter will not make my batter bitter, and so twas, Betty Botter bought some butter, better then the bitter butter.  Cheers.
We had a cheesecake wedding cake, it was 1994 and the concept was still fairly novel. It was a smash hit. Our wedding was tiny, though, with the cake being a featured item. We're still happily married, 30 years next June. Johnny, your day will come; and when it does, I will make good on my offer to loan you my wedding dress. Really, this one could have gone in any order; I couldn't tell a thing from how the judges were talking. We had a worthy winner! Now go forth, t**s out! Love y'all.
Marissa Cakes when?
Shout out to Marissa and fellow divorce’s out there, congrats on winning!
Came for the wedding cake, stayed for Keith turning into Bridezilla
Beef wellington without a recipe and gordon ramsay as a guest judge!!!!
The finale definitely lived up to the hype. There were so many memorable moments but my favorites have to be Eugene constantly uplifting Marissa and Zach's subtle "wife guy" joke 😹
Johnny’s Mom, please don’t be mad. It was an accident that J mentioned it and you are still amazing in our eyes!
Wood is dry! It was part of the presentation!
Eugene helping Marisa and talking her down when she was spiraling with her passion fruit jelly! He’s such a softie! ❤ and then Marisa thanking him at the end! 🥹🥰
“AND I QUOTE” 😂😂😂😂
Eugene's mom trying to be supportive and at the same time pointing out that Eugene isn't the most talented at cooking is the most Asian mom response ever lol
TODAY WE’RE ALL WIFE GUYS ZACH THE VIDEO HASNT EVEN STARTED YET PLEEEEEEASE
Keith is the worst sore loser! He acts like a 5 year old brat when he learns he got last place
Keith loses is the best reactions ever ! 😂
Always a hoot and a holler
Keith you said "batter better". When I was in 5th grade we had to memorize a bunch of poems.  One was called "Betty Botter - Author unknown" it went, "Betty botter bought some butter but she said the butters bitter. If I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter but a bit of better butter, better than the bitter butter will make my bitter batter better. So, she got some better butter, better than the bitter butter, thus was Betty's batter better."😊 I'm 33 and that poem is still fun to say!
Okay I officially love Marissa. I vote her for 4th try gal
I immediately had to pause after Zach's "Today we're all wife guys..." like sir! lolol
i don't know why marissa's judging made me cry ??? i'm so proud of her, this was amazing and she looked SO SO SLAAAAAAY MISS MA'AM!!!!!!! GIVING MISS MARISSA ADDAMS let's GOOOOO
Squig is straight squigging
Am I tripping or is the energy in the judging segment kinda weird and off? Like either people are drunk, or something happened that had to be edited out/off camera, or the editing itself is weird for this ep but for a finale episode it feels...interesting...
IN THAT DRESS?!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Zach should have just called it “Zack’s Cake”, like the weed strain. Also, thank you Keith for using your theatre degree, I appreciate it
…Eugene’s mom 🤌🤌🤌
Why is this episode getting me sooo emotional? 🥺😭 Marissa deserves the win. I agree with Johnny, she is very talented in the kitchen. 👏👏👏
These poor kitchenaids 😂😂
I think I'm in love with Marissa
eugene's cake idea was giving reagan ridley vibes ngl
SPOILER......         So let's recap: 4th place: Keith, who made a dry cake and gave us a true bridezilla moment. 3rd place: Eugene , who made a 2/3 poisonous cake, and was verbally hurt by his mother. 2nd place: Zach, who gave us a cake made for a party. 1st place: Merissa, who gave us a beautiful cake celebrating a harder part of life and a moment with Johnny we will never forget. Overall: THANK YOU TRY GUYS AND LONG LIVE WITHOUT A RECIPE
ZACHS OPENING LINE 😂😂😂😂 STOP
I got emotional when Jonny was judging Marissa. She worked so hard and really wanted to do well. I love when people really try at things and get amazing outcomes.She also looked amazing,could not stop staring at her 😊
Is anyone else bothered by Marisa using her hand to mix when she literally has a spoon in her hand? Just me? Ok.
An ad “do you have anxiety? Breathe and listen to this” came up right after Johnny said people eat barbie heads to enjoy them going through themselves and it was *chef’s kiss* amazing 👌🏻
I really want to watch the live show but I am getting a puppy and I cannot get both so I'm sorry but I'm choosing the puppy
Divorce Cake is gonna be a thing now.
No one watched your Food Network show because we don't have cable 🤣
Zach 🤣🤣
MAAAARRRRRRRRRIIISSSSAAAAAAAA LEGGGGOOOOOOO hellz yeah I legitametly want to eat hee cake so bad. Every aspect is some of my fav things, the lemon and passion jokes SENT ME, GURL U GO that is so amazing
marissa totally earned her win!!!
Eugene should of come in last bc it was potentially poisonous in addition to being dry
Zach's cake make it look like he's just the kid from the movie "Blank Check" all grown up.
I absolutely love the dynamic between Eugene and Marissa. I hope we get to see more of them together. They were so funny and the way he calmed her down was so cute.
SPOILER        Zach deserved that win imo. Something delicious, funky, full of just... Zach? Hers might have been the most delicious but to be fair, it wasn´t a *wedding cake*.  Also, Keith´s reaction was WARRANTED. I have googled how poisonous Hydrangeas are. It´s BAD.
This is the eeend?! I can't believe it.
Maybe I can see myself get married now
Eugene’s mom made smile. It was just pleasant.   But also Marissa looked stunning in the black dress. Also she won so good for her.   Johnny and Marissa could be a good duo.
The WHOLE Try Guys team is BITTER about the fact that no one watched That One Show They Didn’t Promote 😂😂
Eugene went from entertainer to responsible business owner in about 0.1 seconds flat when Marissa broke the glass. Hands up!
ITS GIVING DUSTY
Can I just say that I LOVE EUGENE’S Mom. She is hilarious.
I have never laughed harder than I did over Keith’s reaction. 😂😂😭
How did she guess the stairs? LMAO great episode cant wait to join the live!!
lol the little sign behind Jonny that said "butter makes the batter better honey" was very silly!
I love the fact that Keith kept the flower in hand the entire time 😂😂😂
The IMMEDIATE shade to he who shall not be named is hilarious
Interesting
there being nothing in Keith's favor in the footage to roll back is sooo funny lmaooo
Wow Eugene's is prob the most asain mom I know
OMG the “butter makes the batter better honey” sign behind Johnny after Keith’s say it😂 12:07
@32:29 WONDER OF THE WORLD!!!!
Going forth tits out❤   Slayyyyyyy Marissa
Hellz yeah Marissa!
I hope next time they have the judges bake and the try guys judge an episode. It’d be so cool!
I love that Zach has come so far from hating the bitch ass cardboard in Candid Competition to including it in his own cake!
Asian mum... I can relate Eugene! x
Of course the anti wedding Eugene would accidentally put a poison flower for a poison wedding 😂
Let’s fucking goooooo
Jonny is just amazing 😂 cracks me up every time
I love Eugene' mom sense of humor. ❤
I just appreciate them all helping each other so much.
The fact that 2/3rds of Eugene’s cake was poisoned and still got 3rd place…….👀 that’s hella sus   Let Keith have 3rd with his floor cake lolll
god i fucking love jonny cakes so much
Omg thank you Johnny for always teaching me something new. Just when you think you've heard of everything lmao. 32:23
Eugene helping Marrisa was so sweet and I absolutely love it, this is the support she's needed the whole season.
omggggg my jaw dropped when zach said “were all wife guys” hahahahahahaha
I love Jonny so much and I love getting to see him flex his baking muscles on this channel <3
"Love doesn't alway win and go forth tits out" YES MARISSA🤣what a queen I loved her in these episodes can't wait to see more of her in future episodes hopefully❤ 55:37
i hope there’s an april fool’s episode where they make ‘illusion’ foods, like it looks like it would be sweet and then it’s sour or savoury and vice versa
This may be the best without a recipe yet 😂😂😂
Bruh I absolutely love the wedding cakes. And I try and try each tier.
Something about Zach’s whole reveal and judging made me feel weirdly proud of him like a parent and I don’t understand these feelings but all I know is that Johnny is my favorite judge and he only validated my proud father feelings that have no explanation or rationalization.  Looking forward to all that 2024 has for the Try Guys and their entire amazing team and always thankful for y’all and what you do ❤
What I love is that Keith demanded they roll back the tape and what he claims they said wasn’t said at all. 😂
did… did keith smoke before this episode?
Zach made a wedding dalek!
Its so like Eugene to make poison tiered cake ugh such an icon! A King!
Eugine being so supportive 😭
One of these days, the winner's creations should be recreated with proper recipes and processes, because they're creations? Man, they're CRE-A-TIVE!!!
"We don't know the kink of swallowing Barbie heads, Jonny. Do go on." This is further proof that Eugene's mom is an icon.
*SPOILER*    So I'm not sure if I'm the only one that disagrees with the rankings so I just wanna say mine 4th Place should've been Marissa just on technicality since hers was a divorce cake and this was a wedding cake episode 3rd Place Eugene just cause he unintentionally had poison on the cake 2nd Place Keith and 1st Place Zach based on the judges review  Also Johnny's fun fact about the barbie head thing 🤣🤣🤣 glad they kept that in the video
The spinning wedding ring leading into Marissa's divorce cake was a touch of brilliance.
Keith’s meltdowns are my fave 😂😂😂😂  Congrats Marissa! 🎉🎉🎉
Imagining Johnny's mom watching this w him has me laughing out loud😂
im sorry but keiths meltdowns are everything 😂😂😂😂
I myself am not a nail person, but I could NOT stop looking at and admiring Marissa's nails. That purple is incredible.
Eugene's mom with the hard truths  😂😂😂
the wife guys comment fully gagged me
54:30
Zach’s “Stanley Tucci” shirt is to die for !! 😂
Today we learned that hydrangeas are poisonous. And I love Eugene's Six reference.
These poor kitchen aids 😂
I’m sorry but, Maggie BIT HER WEDDING CAKE??? 😂
No zach!! Its great to see u being so good at baking now!
Alt Title: Jonny Letting His Intrusive Thoughts Win
Why am I crying over a WAR videos 😭😭😭 johny and Eugene  supporting Melissa has me in tearssss
“IT’S MY SPECIAL DAY!” Eugene went Jimbo mode 😂
I just watched 4 ads at a time for this wtf
I love when Keith is outraged 😂😂
This has to he one of THE best WAR episode in terms of all 4 of them doing so well.
Jonny and Rosanna should have Marissa on their YouTube channel to teach her some skills
This episode was EPIC! They all did so great. Proud of my guys and gal! And can we appreciate how much we don't even miss or think about "he who shall not be named"?
Can someone please ask Marissa if she's ready for a second husband? I'd like to put her heart back together. 😂
3rd time Eugene has made something inedible for the judges and not gotten last. I'll never get over the gingerbread house
Eugene's mother never being proud of him is why he's so amazing
Eugene’s pep talk was so genuine. ❤
Can Keith just calm the f down. The tantrums are so cringy and uncomfortable, they’re not funny.
Keith went full bridezilla at the end😂
Marisa's such a star
Finally got my Keith Meltdown and I’m all for it. 😂
Marisa looks so much like lady gaga in her black dress. So pretty! ❤
I love Jonny as a judge. Especially this season of WAR he's been so enthusiastic and really highlighting the great points of each creation. I love the positivity!
Keith: "Yeah, we're the All-Stars." Off Camera: "Oh, Keith!" as he overflows
I feel for the people responsible for cleaning those Kitchenaid's. Every time one is messed up, it makes me cringe....
Everyone always talks about how Zach makes poison on the show, but today Eugene served actual poison
Eugene calming Marissa down was so cute ❤
Anyone gonna mention the irony, that Eugene’s mom has had one divorce, one died, and his cake is the beheaded 😂
I love wedding cake. I’m on the floor dancing with a drink in one hand and a slice of cake in the other hoping someone grabs my cake
Why does Keith look so natural in a wedding dress?
Marisa went on the heros journey of cooking shows.   Starting out saying that she hates cooking, to Johnny saying that she has a future in it, and winning first.  Chef's kiss
Props to the editor on this episode! Great job!
I think i just fell in love even more by Jonny. Jonny i let you eat my cakes anytime
such a good ep
The black dress they have on😛😛😛🤘
“Today, we’re all wife guys” 😂😂😂 I fucking love this channel more and more each day
marissa slayed this episode. she the divorce queen….also she looked stunning in her divorcé dress
“Hey, um you’re not invited back next season”
....my wife?
Just to Start, I think Splitting Marisa and Zach is a benefit to Zach, because she's 😈
Maybe the reason why "Good" Eugene wasn't fully good last season was because Good Eugene needed a little more time to come out, and so good Eugene came out this season in the form of honouring the women in his life and helping hus friends
"In that dress?!" perfect comedic timing
This might be my favorite episode of WAR ever.
Keith turned into a Bridezilla 😂
Zach starting this off with a "wife guy" statement... Greatest start ever 😂😂😂
I love the 💩 that comes out of Johnny's mouth 😂
Would love a pro season or episode of WAR with Jonny, Ro, etc. It would be fun to see how the pros do without a recipe themselves lol for something really unique
This was a delight. I laughed so hard so many times . . . and also spent a lot of it thinking about how beautiful Marissa looks and how gay I am 😂
MARISSAAAAAAAA HELLZ YEAH GIRL!!!🎉🎉🎉
Omg im obsessed with marissa!!! I love her!!❤❤❤
They keep saying Pine, but that's not pine. That's a Lemon Cypress. Pine is edible. Lemon Cypress is not. It's not poisonous, but it's not edible.
Marissa is a smokeshow in that black dress. Damn!
the music and editing on these videos are too much sometimes like a full hans zimmer score is not needed for zach mixing some eggs
25 seconds in... nice
Can Ro be on with a recipe
Congratulations Marissa! I love how kind and supportive Jonny and Eugene were! Eugene calling his mom was hilarious. Great season everyone! Zach and Keith yours were so fun and creative! Keith losing his shit never gets old.  Still living for these animal videos.
zach’s cake was straight out of a beyoncé concert🪩
do cheese next
keith going in the other room saying can you believe this shit I got forth😂
The way I went from feeling so sad for Marissa for the glass break to being literally on the verge of tears proud of her at the end
IN THAT DRESS?!
the "today we're all wife guys" comment was GOLDEN lmao
What a miss for Eugene to not brand him and Marisa The D-Force  lol
Not enough people talking about Marissa’s fucking DRESS  With the lips and slicked hair and “tits out” she looks so incredible, so hot good for her I say
Marissa looks fire in that black dress 🤩
Evil Eugene fused with good Eugene in this episode. Nice cake, with a secret to murder the juges 😅
Can we please appreciate how hot Marissa is during the judging?! Lawd. Everyone else looks so fabulous as usual.
What i thought eugene will lose 😂😂
How did I not know about the hydrangea being poisonous?! Every wedding cake I’ve had brought in to wedding they add extra florals and usually hydrangea
Petition for Claire Saffitz to be a judge!!!
Marisa gave us a whole personal emotional art piece
I really want them to throw Johnny in a without a recipe episode once just for fun to see how someone who does actually know how to bake would do
This episode was GOLDEN! Honestly I love every single WAR -episode, but this definitely went into my top five 😂❤
If I'm going to an event where I have to dress up I want Marissa to be my date
I fucking LOVED Eugene helping Marissa out! That's the real vibe of the show. Not only are we cooking without a recipe... We are also being good friends helping each other and rooting for each other. Part of my love for the Try Guys channel in recent years has been this maintained focus on friendship and trying things for the sake of it while helping your friends who are also trying. So excited for the live show tomorrow!
Everyone looks SO GOOD in their final judging outfits Eugene slays with the gold, Zach is so cute in the purple suit, Marissa is stunning with the slicked back hair, and Keith looks absolutely darling in the white dress
Eugene explaining how everything he did was on purpose "my mom loves sand"
Love doesn’t always win and go forth tits out. Amen. 🙏🏼
Rest in piece Matthew Perry
This episode had me CACKLING! Hearing Jonny give such heartfelt compliments to then saying the most unhinged shit was certainly an experience.
Eugene calling Minyoung to tell her he lost an episode he dedicated to her is so so funny omg
Ohhh I feel bad that Keith's innovative flavor didn't really come through
Marissa is my FAVE
Something about acknowledging that Zach got all the dry ingredients completely correct was very wholesome.
I never get tired of the experts explaining what not to do while the cameraman films the guys doing the exact thing they said not to do 😂
« There’s nothing more basic bitch than a heterosexual wedding » I died laughing 💀
Eugene calming Marisa down was everything. Loved Marisa's cake, concept, looks, it all rocked. Zack's cake looked dope af too. And I love how Keith looks like a deranged bridezilla xD
Can we have Eugene’s mom judge an episode next season?
Congratulations Marissa!!!!!  GET IT GIRL!!
Keith looks amazing in that dress, definitely a good silhouette for him!!!
Every time Keith loses his cool I like him a little less. 😮
High fives to the vfx team member that put the "Butter makes the batter better" plaque on the wall behind Johnny Cakes - I think you'll have to make a real one to stay in there from here forward XD
It'd be amazing if there's a Revenge of the Try without a Recipe, with some of the judges as the contestants for April fools. Maybe they can shout at Keith for fun so everyone wins 😂
Zach please tell me that is new Stanley Tucci merch
Now we’re all wife guys killed me😂
Eugene is so sweet
I have genuinely been rooting for Marissa in every WAR episode she's been in. She's so freaking awesome I love her
Ok. I had to pause the video because omfg... how good does Johnny look in that tux? Cute, hot and handsome? Yes
We bought a cake for tradition but the real dessert for my wedding was an ice cream truck :)
I LOVE EUGENE
I loved Eugene helping Marissa and Jonny’s speeches. I would cry on the spot
Okay I love Marissa, the girl is growing on me
I feel like “plan b” will be trending and no one will know why…except us 🤪🤣♥️
Heck yes!! Fuck all those Marissa haters :p  !! I love me some Marissa and am so excited she did so well!!
Been waiting for this since the birthday cake episode!!! Watching right now CAN'T WAIT
Opening line cracked me up😂
“My mom love sand” - eugene 😂😂 his expression while saying this is so funny 😂😂😂
Why are none of the top comments about Zach saying “Today we are all Wife guys” YALL THAT KILLED ME IMMEDIATELY
👇 Keith wedding fit appreciation club
Damn now I feel like I’m missing out since I’m not there eating Marissa’s spectacular cake
ohhoho! i do hope the judges did not eat eugenes hydrangea in there tho (and it didnt ooze) bc albeit only a little hydrangea does contain cyanide! edit: i love that the judge immediately mentioned this also
Keith looks like a Quinceañera 😂 and I love he didn’t break character, holding his rose up the whole time ❤
perfect opening line
rosanne is so freaking pretty 😭😭😭😭
Not the all wives guys comment 😅😂
Ok but can we pls take a moment to appreciate Zach's baking?? His skills have improved so much since past seasons and I'm really proud of him
Since we had a Claire Saffitz shout out I’d like to point out that she would make an amazing judge!!!!!
Marissa is not built for the Try Guys... she had zero fun and just panicked the whole time....
Marissa is serving us Liz Gillies realness.
omg lcd soundsystem cake!!!
I got to the ranking and there was like 10 minutes left and I was like "oh! There must be an ad or something"  No... It was just Keith getting mad and Eugene calling his mom
At least Keith’s wasn’t poisonous tho LOL idk if he deserved his rank
11:56 LMAO Keith's quote and then the subsequent cut to Johnny with the quote on the kitchen wall was a nice touch. Much better than "Live, Laugh, Love" decor!
Marissa is so iconic!!!!!! ❤
Not Keith trying to gaslight to judges into a better score
If only there was a guy that made being married his personality
Every time I think I'm bad at cooking I watch this show and feel just a tiny bit better. Granted I'm not under their level of pressure and don't have an audience but still.
Also, can we talk about how hot Marrisa looks?! 🔥
oh god the hydrangea poison twist lol
Ngl I kind of agree with Keith. Eugene's cake was 2/3 poisonous 😭
MARISSA YAAAAAASSSS!!! 😮 Damn, my girl pulled a that black veil from outta her ass last minute and I’m totally her for it. Yaaasss girl, u betta work it!!! That thing had me shook to my core. One minute no veil …. The next minute, VEIL! Love it! Reminding everyone what kind of video this is after all 😂😂😅😅😅
Why does Eugene’s cake batter look like a Leviathan from Supernatural? 😂
“Please enjoy dis cake” 🕺🏾
Eugene's mum is a mood 😂
Goal for 2024 find me a woman like marissa
I like the fact that y'all always help each other even though you're competing against each other.
So happy for Marissa! 💔
I really enjoyed the LCD Soundsystem reference
keith's reaction at his placement 😹
ohmygod i got so scared for marissa's hands in that bowl zach's lilac frosting is so prettyyy ! home improvement? like our former try wife? eugene is third because he helped marissa probably but i'm happy she won !
ZACHS OPEN HELL YES 🤘🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥😂
Nice to see that they didnt really learn much despite doing cakes so many times lmao
I love how I didn’t even blink at Keith wearing a wedding dress. Great episode all!
Keiths cake lost to literal poison XD
First, there was the foot cake.  Now, there's stairs cake...
The way Marrissa has watched the old WAR eps and knows the catastrophe of overmixing!!!
Eugene has really been so amazing to people this season. There’s a warmth and kindness to him right now that I’m not totally used to, giving off some kind of fun uncle energy 😂❤
“Today we’re all wife guys” 😂😂 I love these petty Easter eggs 🤪
why is marissa a grown ass woman and not know how to do anything
How have they STILL not learned to stop over mixing their damn cakes?? It must be on purpose atp you’ve had like 5 cake episodes
every time marissa makes a mistake: Eugene: oOH! IvE dOnE tHaT bEfOrE!
Bless Eugene for bullying(? but positive) Marissa into having a plan B ready EDIT: the Jonny/Marissa interaction was so wholesome!!
no but like 0:25 seconds in and im LOSING IT AHAHHAHAH
*sees thumbnail*  Oh this is gonna be good *rubs hands like birdman* 😅
we're all wife guys is CRAZY
Marissa is so pretty w the black dress during judging!!! also Eugene helping her out w the passion fruit 🥺🥺
Lmfao not the "WE'RE ALL WIFE GUYS" 😂💀
I love this for Marissa
johnny’s accidental inappropriate factoid was so relatable it made me like him even more
off topic but keith slayed so hard in that wedding dress
Omg…can we get a Jonny Cakes and Marissa collab!?
Zach's cake looks like a Dalek.
jonny blushing and saying "and i'm so sorry i sad the thing about the barbie heads." had me rolling. XD
Yayyyyy Marissa!!! Hell yeah for divorces girl I got one too! I wanna try your cake!
eugene really went in with the Six theme, huh
this was such a heartwarming episode, I absolutely loved it! I hope Marissa really does find some joy in baking, that was so so sweet!
Man, when Eugene said hydrangea, I was like "I'm sure that's poisonous" and I'm regretfully right. Likely, what is there will not cause permanent harm in a grown adult, but more than likely could make someone very unwell depending on what they consume.  If using flowers to decorate a cake, there are many lovely edible flowers, specially grown to be safe to eat. (So a rose can be edible, but not all roses are edible. Please don't eat random plants. This is todays PSA)
I'm a wedding vendor and honestly all us vendors and staff are the one's who eat the wedding cake.
So if Zach was originally going to make all episodes this season queef themed......
Eugene´s mom is iconic
God I love Johnny
OMG, the reactions to Marissa's cake almost made me cry!
dat moment during Marissa's judging ❤ Jonny's comments + Zach's joke LOL
i am so proud of marissa omgggg
Keith’s Bridezilla moment gives me LIFE 😂😂😂
SPOILER:     Keith yelling in that wedding dress after losing gave a whole new meaning to bridezilla😂
Marissa in addition to a great cake had a bangin Revenge Dress! Get it, girl!
“Today we’re all wife guys” *immediate laughter*  Me: oh Zach that is so petty….. I’m 👏here👏for👏it👏
Keith is so pretty on that wedding dress omg
Yo if marissa is trying to remarry hmp
oh my my surprise,a without a recipe on a Wednesday,
Eugene's mom is a SAVAGE
This is one of the best WAR episodes ever! Eugene is such a treasure🥲
I’m so proud of Zach!! Getting the measurements right and creating a stunning cake! He has had the best character development on this show. Plus, I could not stop staring at his beautiful lavender suit. Bravo, Zach!! 🪩 🕺
Zach is so close to a Dalek Cake :)
Eugene’s “Marisa…look at me” and pep talk at 23:12 almost brought tears to my eyes 🥹. Such a good friend, daddy, person, everything 🧡.
In that dress?!? 😭😭😂😂😂😂
Marisa looks so hot, that divorcee look?? Obsessed
“Today, we’re all wife guys” oh dear… I love a good shady callback😂😂😂
Now who in their right mind would divorce that?!😮
Marissa giving adult Wednesday Addams and I’m loving it
I am so happy that Keith got last place again on without a recipe cakes. It’s tradition at this point and it makes my day.
Eugene’s mom is savage and I’m so here for it ❤
Keith genuinely looks really pretty in the wedding dress
We don't get much Eugene these days, but when we do he seems so much happier and more relaxed and I'm really glad to see it. I'm sure with everything he's got going on he has plenty of stress, but it seems like he's loosened up and isn't so hard on himself.
I loved EVERYTHING about this episode! Eugene calming Marissa down and saying he wanted her to win (which she does!), her and Zach getting 1st and 2nd (deservedly so), Eugene accidentally poisoning most of his cake, Keith’s bitch fit (only for his argument to get disproven in the playback)…all GOLD! 😆  Also, the divorce cake winning the wedding cake episode is SUCH a flex! “Go forth tits out” indeed. 🤣🤣🤣
Crying at marissa’s cake judging 🥹🥰
The true "good eugene" season. Watching him root on Marissa and help her warmed my cold, black heart.
Keith took mixing by hand a little too literally 😅
WE’RE ALL WIFE GUYS TODAY I’M SCREAMINGGG
Box cake mix hack use apple juice instead of water and mix while turning the bowl for about 10 minutes,  it should puff up like bread. Then back as directed.  Let me know how it worked?😊
Keith ranting in the dress has me in tears 😭
Thanks!
I think my favorite part of Without A Recipe is when they cut to the professionals saying "I would never...." and then it cuts to one of the guys doing exactly that one thing the pro said you should never do.
This series has just got to continue on forever. I dont care if yall run out of food to make i love these vids
Whyyyyyyy 😢
Eugene’s mom is so asian mom core😭
Oh my god Melissa,  you look fucking amazing! Way to rock the dress and the cake! Can I request more of Johnny? Because he is absolutely delightful and I love him so much! Oh my god the phone call with Eugene's mom too , this is the best episode yet 😂
Keith deserved more
9:30 Keith is committing *war crimes* against that poor Kitchenaid, my god.
This was such a funny episode. I think it was one of my favorites of all time for Without a Recipe.
39:01 This moment between Johnny and Zach was so sweet 🥹
I really liked this episode Also Eugenes mom absolutely rasting the living crap out of him realy drives it home
This was disappointing. Watching Keith and Eugene basically through everything they’ve learned out the window
Eugene's pep talk was too perfect 🥰
Keith is a Bridezilla 😂😂
So satisfying to see Johnny as the "expert" in this video
I love how Eugene's mom said he has no talent for cooking! jajjajjajaa
Melissa totally missed the chance to say “Eat your heart out” 😂
TODAY WE’RE ALL WIFE GUYS  ☠️☠️ (Produced by Zach Wolf)
I feel bad for the third judge. I knew nothing of her skills because she didn't make the cake as an example 😢
Good god the baking soda/powder....  Not the mix time on Eugene's 😅  Ah Keith .. I hope that tree was there for that not just like... One of the office plants 😂  Aww Eugene helping Marissa through her filling process 🥹  JOHNNY!! HUUHHH?? (Swallowing barbie heads because huhhhhh)  Zach saying he's a size queen and a pillow princess?? (Okay I understand my partner now when they said they thought Zach was gay, after only watching try guys for last 2 months)  Oh God Keith cancelling the judges 😅  Eugene's mom 😂😂  Yay for Marissa!! Love doesn't always win!
Johnny cakes judging was so sweet, highlighting the great points of each cake and the growth the try guys had made from previous seasons.❤❤❤
watching eugene problem solve is a beautiful thing
They all look so amazing, especially Keith and Marissa 😍
“Today we’re all wife-guys” I ran to like the video 😂
Can we still watch the live after if we don't buy a ticket?
so like no ones gonna talk about the way kieth mixed his cake mix
Keyth really took the mixing cakes by hand to heart.
The headless groom was a bit black widowesque
Poison cake is the most Eugene thing he's ever done. As he said himself in illusion cakes, "you can't take the bad out of the boy"
I literally jumped out of my chair when Marissa won! Haha this was such a great episode.
You know what, Marissa gives divorced in the best way possible. She's giving liberated, she's giving "I'm not your mom" she's giving over it & loving it. I love Marissa.
I died at “today, we’re all wife guys”. I love the subtle shots Zach has been taking recently
“Today.. we’re all wife guys!” IM FUCKING CRYING 😂🤣😂🤣😂
I would have Keith bake my wedding cake
HEY NOW I WATCHED IT <3
MARISSA FOR THE WINNNN NAME IS LUCKY. I LOVE HER SM
not enough people talking about the butter makes the batter better honey sign they made hanging behind Johnny even I wanna hang that in my kitchen
LOVE DOESNT ALWAYS WIN AND GO FORTH TITS OUT hell yeah
“In THAT dress?!” Got me XD
I say this with kindness, Keith's anger/yelling in these - even in jest - could use a trigger warning. It's uncomfortable at best and trauma inducing at worst.
Watching Keith get 4th place in 2x speed is so chaotic and way better than in normal speed 😭😭😭
See you tomorrow! 🫶🤌✌️
Marissa is iconic
Jonny. I feel you. Everyone is getting married and having babies and I am doing nothing I want to be doing 😂😅
😮😮😮😮
Eugene may not have won the day for his mom, but he was certainly supporting the women in his life ♥
Please never stop without a receipt. This season especially this episode has been the best. So funny and entertaining. The new guests dynamic was very fun. Ignore Keith, you can't get rid of Johnny and Rosanna!!!
Im so proud of zach???? The growth 🥹🥹🥹
Eugene was spot on with people over 50 eating the cake at weddings 😂 I don't think I've ever wanted to eat wedding cake, even at my own wedding after the one bite I ate other desserts
Can someone please tell me where to watch this darn show they keep mentioning that I didn’t watch? Lol it’s hard to watch a show you don’t know exists!
Is that the produce101 theme song on the background during Zach’s cake presentation? 😂😂 slay
Marissa is soooo fine
From working in a kitchen full time, the way they treated that glass situation with Marissa’s mixer is so real! That threat of big injuries is so real with automatic machinery!
I hate Keith’s angry rants. I get they are a bit, but they are so unsettling. I was literally tensing up knowing they were going to give him last and he was going to ruin the whole vibe by acting like a toddler. Find a different bit, screaming red faced angry white man sucks.
Marissa got her handshake from Paul Hollywood this episode
Eugene, idk something about him never really hit and now they it’s been announced he’s leaving makes sense. His energy was just never really in it.
Keith is KILLING that dress and lil tiara
Marissa clearly did her research, she called out Eugene for doing the same thing Keith  did in the first cake video 😂
I love not only how Eugene helped Marissa and she gave him credit for that but she did so in a way that kept to her theme. She also did warn him that he was over-mixing his batter. Keith and Zach just giggling together and creating massive chaotic energy was great.
Gotta have the booba in the thumbnail
I've never watched a without a recipe with this look 😬 stuck on my face for so long. The batter was stressing me out!
Marissa, throughout her time in the season, had really good ideas. I'm glad one of the ideas ended up executed well ❤🎉 Go girl!
charging for access to a live stream is absolutely jake paul wilin
Everyone looks soooo good! Keith looks so beautiful; the dress suits him so well great silhouette,Marissa looks hot normally her style is fun but this look is giving sexy hot lady, Eugene looks like a androgynous god and Zack looks very dashing in his suit. And no matter what they all did great!
Johny and Marissa baking show where Johny teaches and helps Marissa learn new recipes! It would be so fun , heartwarming , as well as funny because they are both very funny.
love doesnt always win!!
I see what you did there in the background.... "Butter makes the batter better, Honey!"
Poor Keith. He looked so pretty in his wedding dress. They crushed that poor bride's dreams. How could they give him 4th place in that dress.
Keith turned into a Bridezilla
Johnny and Eugene talking about gay weddings is exact type of gay I am
ZACH 😂😂I’m 45 seconds in and I gasped so loud 😂😂
yall should have Julien, as a guest or host, on one of your Without A Recipes!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Keith does look really pretty!
I wanna divorce Marissa
I get so happy every time Johnny is in a video. The shit he says is so out of pocket, he has me cracking up every time. Also the genuine support he showed for Zach and Marissa warmed my heart lolol
I would love love love to see them make  pizza bagels bites
Thank you to the team at The Try Guys for posting this video today! I was just told that I have a non cancerous brain tumor which I did surgery for yesterday. This video has really brightened my day!
I've been to a few wedding in my short time on this Earth, I LOVED the cakes, I am a cake girl and if there is cake, IM THERE
Eugene's mom telling him he didn't have talent for cooking when he wins consistently seems like a very Asian mom thing to say. 😂 he's so talented
I think this is my favorite episode this season! I loved the themes of their cakes. There was craziness but not too much. I love the “chefs”. Also everyone looked great during the judging! Like Jonny and Ro look like a bride and groom they were so dapper!
Keith canceling them is hilarious
Keith’s “I disagree” delivery was just PERFECT
Zach’s stanley tucci shirt is so beautiful
The editing of this finale is so amazingly funny and love that Marissa did a great job even with freaking out. Love that Eugene helped out too. His cake was so fun with the different flavors and the Zach disco ball 🎉 you've come so far guys. Keith freaking out at losing always is so funny 😅
we got a read from Eugene and now Zach 😂  Also, it’s so nice to hear 4 creative ideas now
Its hilarious that they faked Keith into thinking he got first place in the WAR - Gingerbread House and did the same thing here but with 4th place 😂😂
Keith became a bridezilla while wearing his dress and I loved every second of it!
Marissa looks so good in the results omgg the make up?? The hair??? Congrats too girl you killed it!!
Yo! I’m here at 7h!!! Anyway, yummy cake. :3
Bridgeville Keith is it
Keith looks surprisingly great in that dress though. I'm kinda jealous haha
I fucking love Marissa!!!!! ❤😂
I feel like they should have at least gotten fake flowers to put on Eugene cake., but also love how he showed both worry and support with Marissa while they were in the kitchen. i do hope in future without a recipe episodes they're paired together
Omg I’m so proud of Marissa! It took me so many years to make a good cake WITH A RECIPE so to make one good without one is so awesome 🎉🎉🎉
The Butter makes the Batter Better sign behind Jonny right after 😂
Hahahahaaaha she sounded like R2-D2 when she turned the kitchen aid on
When they’re scared to announce 4th place it’s always Keith 🤣
Keith getting upset about his dry cake had me LOL at work. I almost got in trouble 😂
Everything about this was amazing! All the cakes were so impressive, and I'm so happy for Marissa that she got the win on this one! Everyone's judging outfits were incredible, and Eugene's call to his mom was just hilarious. I also loved how genuine Johnny was being with everyone, he's seen them make some really terrible stuff so it was awesome to see him really praise them for perhaps one of the first times where everyone made a really good dish! And of course "today, we're all wife guys" was an incredible way to start the episode 😂 Thank you all for another amazing season of WAR!
„A couple that loves floors“ LMAO
I love how Marissa's presentation dress is giving Dolly de Leon. (Keith told you, Filipinos are a big part of the fan base!)  Kidding aside, this has got to be the best episode in terms of what the bakers presented and I agree with the judges that it's sad someone had to be 4th
Unbelievably jealous of Zach's shirt 😭✨️
TODAY WE'RE ALL WIFE GUYS
We needed more of these , they are honestly the only thing I like to watch on this channel lol
Johnny was fighting for his life this episode lmao
Wife guys 😂😂
Zachs cake almost looks like a darlak 😂
i'm proud  of Zach for getting the base cake mix 100% correctly. Phenomenal!!!
johnnys vibes are a little weird this ep lol
Keith's rant at the end with his loss was the best moment in this video. so funny this man 😂😂😂😂 and he's right.
Shout out to the editors on this episode 😂
Pause- Respectfully, Marissa looks HOT presenting her cake to the judges, like miss girl looks absolutely STUNNINGGGG, get it girllllllll do yo thanggggg. Her dress, her hair, her makeup are just absolutely YESSSSSSSS!!!!
Marissa is a complete mood in this one, and I've never liked her more 😂
I love Jhonny❤❤
22:26 LOVE THE FRIENDS REFERENCE ♡
Zacks cake is giving Dalek
Zach's cake is giving Beyoncé's RENAISSANCE album😊
Okay... I am so sorry for the oggling comment... But I cannot take my eyes off of Marissa. She's gorgeous. Very pretty! Something very primal triggered in my male psyche seeing her in that dress with her hair slicked back... Stunning. There was cake? I'm so sorry....
marissa looked GORGEOUS in that dress!! the fit, the hair, the makeup, just WOW
i just love getting ungodly high and watching try guys. i swear i could watch em over and over again. love you’re reincarnated grandma💁🏼‍♀️
I tried to infuse flavors of wood lmao😂😂
Zach's intro 😂😂😂😂
You guys had me at "butter makes the batter better hunny" sign over the sink. Bravo edditers.
I adore how supportive Eugene is for Marissa. He sounded so alarmed when he warned her to put her hands up when the glass broke. (I bet he was thinking of what happened to Zach.) And he helped her figure out her Plan B when the filling wasn't setting.  Also, I laughed way harder than I should have when Eugene described Without a Recipe as "the show where we make stuff with baking and it's bad."
Kinda EMOTIONAL RN MARISSAAAAAAA TITS OUT GURL!
My husband installs floors for a living and the comment about Keith's cake being for a couple that loves floors made me laugh 😂
Marissa is right, divorce should be celebrated. My sister got divorced and threw herself a party, she went bowling and played minigolf and drank cocktails. It made up for everything she missed out on with her covid wedding.
zack PLEASE tell me where you got that stanley tucci shirt OMG
23:12 okay daddy Eugene
Idea for next season....Without A Recipe: Average Joe Edition. here it's the Try Guys (whichever ones are competing) and then some random person from the street or fan raffle winner! lol like....are they a professional baker? or can they only make food in a microwave? The potential for chaos always lingering in the background!
Keith my heart goes with you
23:12 Eugene switched into pep talk mode so fast lol
i feel like shes exaggerating about the hydrangeas, i feel like maybe like dogs or small children will get hurt but like they're grown and its a lil flower, i say eat them!
I love marrisa lol
omg zach’s shirt is amazing
Awe, Johnny is so sweet!
Kieth really went into bridezilla mode😂😂😂
I'm sorry but Melissa in the black dress really reminds me of Elizabeth Gillies
I feel like this was very healing for Marissa - love that for her 🖤
Johnnycakes oversharing is everything
Marissa's hero's journey is one for the history books
It would be cool if th order was keith, zach, eugene, then marissa. becuse it could tell a story😂
"I don't think you have much talent for cooking" has the same energy as "I think that you should pursue other means of honoring your father"
eugene seems like he’s going easier on himself love to see it
I have never hit the like button faster than when Zach opened the video with the "today we're all wife guys" line.  THE SHADE IS REAL AND I WAS LIVING! Incredible season, SO BUMMED I can't watch live because I will be on a plane :'(
Marissa's "passion fruits" are lookin 👌 in her talking head segment. Yes girl!!
This is my all time fave try guys video. From EPG (Eugene poison gate) , to Marissa making a divorce wedding cake, and keiths buckets, and the chandler moment, it’s perfection
I had no idea Johnny actually baked i just thought his name was Johnny Cakes and like he was here for... fun? lmao I love him
Why did I think the wedding cake was the live event? The panic I had when I thought I missed the live event! 😂
Zach with the wife guy joke had me ROLLIN’!!!!!!!
the sign butter makes the batter better honey that they put behind Johnny is so funny
“We’re all the Wife Guy” “I made a good cake on that show no one watched” This is the season of SALT
I love the visual comedy the editors put in. the camera cutting from Keith saying "butter makes the batter better honey feels like its on a sign in a moms kitchen" to the sign directly behind johnny made me laugh so hard 💀
yes!! so proud of Marissa! that cake looked incredible fr. I love that she thanked Eugene in front of the judges —shows great sportsmanship and humility. I hope she’s back next season 🤞
This was such a good episode!
This season was soo good everyone did a great job, and Marissa is soo fun on the show, hope to see her in future seasons.
I love Eugene and Marissa together they're so cute hyping each other up
Keith's Bridezilla!
Eugene putting poison in accidentally is not what I expected. I thought when the time came it would be on purpose 😂
Zak made a fancy Dalek lmfao!
marissa is so adorable!!
Eugene’s mom saying he has a great talent for eating is incredible and so relatable 😂
Love doesn't always win, go forth tits out
The way Eugene said his mom’s marriages ended by “divorced”, “died”, MENTIONED SIX THE MUSICAL— and then the cake topper got beheaded… It’s actually high art.
"We're all wife guys" - Zack   Most iconic quote of 2023
Eugene explaining his wedding cake to the judges is exactly what an art class critique feels like for a project that didn't go your way so you rolled with a bs story
I'm so proud of Marissa she really killed it!!!!
Of topic but they have to cover trolls band together on guilty pleasures
This has GOT to be one of, if not THE best episode of Without a Recipe
You get a like for Zach’s “wife guys” joke 😂😂
I love the way Eugene is give hope & confidences to Marisa, I love it. He did the same thing when Keith messed up with his pumpkin pie 🥧. & Keith won that episode.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤
So much Jonny this season makes me so happy! Truly my favourite Try Buddy 🩶
Jonny is so self-depricating, it's nice to see him confidentally preparing a cake.
Keiths shoulders look so hot in that halter top
12:00 when keith says butter makes the batter better honey and then it cuts to johnny with a sign in the background with those words made me chuckle 😭😭😭
I would love to see the judges reaction to these videos after they’ve already eaten
Marissa is just a fun and fresh addition to the cast and her dinamic with every try guy is so funny they should have her in more episodes
I would be so stoked if one of these seasons they have Babish from Binging with Babish on the show as a judge
Excuse me but did no one else notice the “butter makes the batter better honey” behind Johnny?!😂
Johnny has this great supportive teacher energy I hope he gives classes
Watching Keith make his cake is what watching someone have a nervous breakdown looks like. 10/10, no notes.
Keith said about the butter, they should make a merch
the way eugene is so nonbothered about his own success in the competition and stops everything to give marisa LEGIT EXCEPTIONAL advice was so touching.
THIS EPISODE WAS SO SWEET CONGRATS MARISSA
Rio chandler bing
Marissa killed it not just with the cake, but she was serving the confident divorcee look, too! Rock on!
I'm so proud of Marissa!!!!
Just when you started thinking the guys were getting too good for "without a recipe"...
"Today we're all wife guys"😂😂
Keith is a beautiful bride
This episode was so heartwarming!
Eugene and Melissa was such a good duo
Omg. CAN WE HAVE EUGENES MOM AS A JUDGE? Or something. Anything. Just bring her on.
I would love to see the judges reactions watching them bake. They would be terrified
Marissa graduating from bad baking is awesome but also sad if they don’t bring her back in more episodes
I love Marissa! I want to see more of her, especially interacting with Zach like a bratty little sister.  Her cake was so good!
i hope the judges never watch the video and see how keith made his cake LOL
Johnny being so excited about Zach’s cake is giving me life
I screamed 'NO' at the screen when he said "we are all wife guys"
when Eugene was giving Marissa in her frantic collapse suggestions near the end there , I'm very surprised he didn't suggest putting a fondant strap on, a ball gag on it, and say it's for Peggy's wedding night.. When all else fails....Symp the cake...last resort. The infamous finale of Jonny's face cake-- remixed. Love Marissa and Eugene combo btw! vibes-
Johnny seems like such a sweet and encouraging person, I hope we will continue to see him regularly!
I really loved the vibes of this episode. Jonny being the good cop really warms my heart. So proud of Marissa! 🎂💔🥳
The "BUTTER MAKES THE BATTER BETTER HONEY" sign behind Jonny! Oh my God 💀
Stern Supportive Eugene is my favorite 😊😊
I SCREAMED AT THE START OF THE VIDEO
0:25 this is absolutely so fucking funny I did an actual spit take
The one episode where they all made something enjoyable to eat
I fucking love Eugene
“old fashioned… and floor” please hahahaha
I was not prepared for that joke barely thirty seconds in 💀💀💀😂😂😭😭💀
So proud of marissa after she got 3rd the whole season
Zachs intro😭🤣
not knowing that the flowers he placed were poisonous and hearing it at the end was indeed the drama and shock factor I needed
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE WINNER GIVES ME FLASHBACK TO THE BROWNIES EPISODE  I AM SO HAPPY I HAVE TEARS IN MY EYES 🥹🖤🖤🖤
ZACH!!!😂😂😂 THAT WAS EVERYTHING!!!!
Anybody else constantly yelling Keith what are you doing and dying of laughter
Now im not an expert right...but i live in the woods...i..i dont think thats pine
it's not a try guys without a recipe without a keith explosion and damn I missed exploding Keith, let alone bridezilla Keith
THE WIFE GUY REFERNCE HAHA
The way I spat out my drink with Zach saying “we are all wife guys”   I love the shad he has been throwing. It’s top teir
Keith the bridzilla 😂
Keith raging in a wedding dress is taking me out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Also, I fucking love Marissa! Hope to see more of her in the future.
Amé demasiado a Eugene y Marissa ❤
Eugene was SO SWEET this episode 🥹 He wouldn't let Marissa bad mouth herself. He calmed her down and helped her think🫶🏾💙  JOHNNY😭😭
I literally teared up when Eugene calmed Katie down and got her centered again. As a person with anxiety those friends are worth more than their weight in gold. My husband is that person for me. That moment might get lost in all the fun, but I saw Eugene be a great friend and that isn't lost on me.
Marissa still “friends” with her ex husband… no red flags here
Keiths bridezilla moment had me dying
so .. what you're saying is your single 😉
it's very unfortunate that keiths and zachs parents are still together
The butter-batter sign showing up behind Jonny right after Keith said it was perfect
This was such an awesome episode!!!
Marissa is so fun to watch
i love how often eugene comforts marissa when she makes a mistake by saying he’s done that before
The "wife guys" comment LOL
"a wedding for herself" is eugene's mom sue sylvester???
Keith is a beautiful bride 😂
Wait so Marissa's goal was to beat Zach and she's basically undefeated
Marissa looks straight out of a Robert Palmer video. Love it!
i just love that marissa won
Eugene mother is the real Asians parents. 😂
What a fabulous episode! Congratulations, Marissa! The divorce cake looked fabulous and delicious!! It was nice to see the appreciation and acknowledgement of Eugene's help through it all. The way Eugene guided Marissa to a Plan B, and calming her anxiety, was so thoughtful and heartwarming. One of the best WAR moments!  Also, Eugene's mom saying he has no talent for baking but does have talent for eating was top tier!! What a wild call!😂
been watching a lot of without a recipe recently and noticed that when the judges are mostly men they don't scream so much about losing or yell at the judges when they say something negative. just something to think about.
Jonny said everything that needed to be said. I’m so proud of Zach’s progress but Marissa’s comeback was impressive af
the concept for keiths cake is actually really cute, i havent made it to the finished product yet
Keith’s monologue when he found out he lost is an amazing villain origin story
Eugene has always been close to my heart but that IMMEDIATE reaction to Marissa starting to spiral stopped me short with tears. It's so lovely to see the firm solid ground he was offering her, and the way that he pushed her back up so she felt confident enough to keep going. A+++++++
Marissa is my favorite addition by far ❤
Can we just talk about how much of a bad ass Marissa looks like?
THIS IS FOR MARISSA. MARISSA I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU THE CAKE LOOKED BEAUTIFUL, AS A CHILD OF DIVORCE IM SO HAPPY DIVORCE WON
Why I am laughing all the way through Keith’s judging?? Wait this is the most I’ve laughed on a Try Guys vid in a long long time.
Lmao how did they all do so badly
Rosanna is literally so beautiful. My god. Such a good episode!
Johnny’s comment to Marissa was everything. ❤
Not Eugene making a Six! reference with "divorced and died" only to then BEHEAD the groom on the cake. Elite.
Marissa wearing a "revenge dress" during the judging lol
The metaphorical power of two poison layers surrounding one beautiful, intelligent, talented, dry layer of cake is too much. Literary perfection
OK nobody talking about how smoking hawt Marissa looks in the black divorcee look!?!?!? Girl ate and left no crumbs
Oh god it was so funny when the mom of Euguene told him he is not good at cooking. I hope i can watch the live
Man Keith cannot catch a break with Cakes
Me bursting into laughter when eugene references chandler 😂
Definitely dig Marissa's style with the outfit going with the theme of her cake. Definitely has some sorta Lydia Deets vibe to it.
I love how they photoshopped a ‘butter makes the batter better honey’ sign behind johnny after keith was talking about it 😂
We stan bridezilla Keith
This episode was fantastic! Everyone made great cakes that were edible and stood up! And Zach’s improvement was so rewarding. Marissa’s cake was incredible. It wasn’t the normal chaotic delight we’ve come to expect but I think it was actually better! So looking forward to WAR Live tomorrow.
Yeeeeeeeeeeeessss Marissa!!! 🎉🎉🎉
I died when Eugene called his mom. 😅
6 hours? I’d consider that as early
The little "No!" you hear from off-screen Rachel was absolutely worth it for the Wife Guy joke, so many thanks Zach 😂
The baker in me is absolutely losing her sh!t.  The chaos goblin in me is having the best day🤣
OMG what an opener
LIES! WE LIVE FOR THE CAKE 😂
Hahaha it’s my birthday on friday too! So the cake is perfect!
I love how Marissa learned from her attempt at smores & did not overdo it with the gelatin lol
This is the season of "Sweet Supportive Eugene" ❤💛💜 We love every facet of Eugene and I'm pretty gutted we're gonna see even less of him for the next 6 months, but I'm so glad he's exploring his passions and can't wait to see what he comes out with 💙🧡🖤
I love how Marissa learned from her attempt at smores & did not overdo it with the gelatin lol
Not the "wife guys" shade xD lol
I know you don't have this concept in USA but as I'm sure you are running out of ideas, next season you should make smörgåstårta translated sandwitch cake. It's a Swedish/Nordic thing where they make "cake" out of sandwitch items. Usually there is lot of mayonese, ham and fish maybe (depends on the filling) and it's decorated like a cake with things you put on bread. Just google it and you get the idea. I would love to see their spin on it!
Marissa is giving Aubrey Plaza vibes and I'm loving it
I’m literally crying at what Johnny said to Marissa
Not me having a mental breakdown and seeing this like "yeah my life ain't THAT bad"
MARISSA DESERVED THIS WIN 🙏💪
😆 Keth Has Become Bridezillas😆
Honestly so impressed with Marissa, she works methodically even if it’s at a slower pace, and has learned from everything she’s seen.
Going to a wedding and I’m gonna get some of that fucking cake as a bridesmaid
Spruce tip syrup is fucking delicious, Keith should've used some. It also has a nice red color that could've shone through in a filling or something.
Love this show
YAY MARISSSAAAAAAA!!!!! <3
So we have all learned that Johnny is an oversharer
Marissa has to be disqualified because she didn't do a wedding cake, so...
Keith’s bridezilla level monologue was BEAUTIFUL. Punctuated by some yelling “is that a dress??” A cinematic masterpiece
Eugene is so motivational, helpful and kind to Marisa, it’s so sweet to see
the funniest part is that the cake that was 2/3 inedible bc of poison wasn’t 4th 😂😂
-Eugene being such a sweetheart -Zach ACTUALLY making a really good cake -Marrissa winning -Keith exploding while wearing a dress This was my favorite 😂without a recipe
“Today we’re all wife guys” LMAOOO
I laugh way too hard every time Zack calls Jonny Jonathan Cakes
Keith telling Rosanna she’s cancelled after her cancellation a few weeks ago
please the butter makes the batter better sign behind johnny
I actually teared up cause I was so proud of Marissa! She did so good!!
Kieth. Take the L and shut it please
Love doesn’t always win, and go forth tits out!!!
CRAZY opening 0:33 seconds 😭😭
Not Try Guys making my parent ask me what a size queen and pillow princess is 😭
The way Eugene starts supporting Marissa 🥺🫶🏻
"Today we're all white guys!"  Someone off camera, probably Rachel, just says "NO."
Love doesn't always win And go forth  Tits out!
Really love how they put the sign in behind Jonny lmao 12:03
keith looks so sweet in his tiara
Haha…. Zach coming in with a ZINGER right off the bat!
Eugene's drag race references are not appreciated enough haha
before this season of without a recipe I already had a crush on marissa now I want to marry her so thank you try guys team I guess????
“Go Forth, Tits Out” is a piece of merch I’d buy in every color
My favourite people ♥️
Kinda iconic that Marissa beat Zach again lmao
Keith getting into the delusion that the judges ever said anything about his and Eugenes cake together when Marissa is the only one to have compared them and called keiths cake worse,the exact opposite which his alter ego heard was the cherry on top for this video.
Marissa looks so good in this judging look!
Also obsessed w Marisa’s hair slicked back like this
Why is Eugene suggesting a plan b filling SO WHOLESOME
Keith getting into the delusion that the judges ever said anything about his and Eugenes cake together when Marissa is the only one to have compared them and called keiths cake worse,the exact opposite which his alter ego heard was the cherry on top for this video.
Loved all the outfits for the juding! What a fun finale!!! Looking forward to the live stream too
I worked at a wedding reception hall in Utah for 6 years. A lot of them would be kind enough to share some of the cake with the staff, I’ve eaten probably 30+ different wedding cakes. So I am judging this episode as a professional
The "butter makes the batter better honey" sign after Keith's bit is so funny😂
justice for keith his cake was the prettiest
Go Marissaaaa 🎉❤
good thing they had an expert there to let them know eugene made his cake poisonous lmao
Poor Keith hahahahaha, damn bro lol, Eugene noooo lol on live television and finally, LET'S GO MARISSA!!
At my wedding, everyone ate the cake and loved it... didn't hear a single complaint and didn't have anyone not eat it LOL (38 people wedding for ref)
i love how eugene was constantly being like OHH IVE DONE THAT BEFORE while he was cooking w Marissa so she didn't panic so much LOL
“Today we’re all wife guys” 😂😂🤣🤣
Zach with that opening 😂😂
Everyone looked SO GOOD! (Both judges and contenders) And it was so heartwarming to see how supportive Jonny and Euegene were for Marissa 🖤 And how low key savage Eugene's mom was to him too of course lol
Aweeee was this pre- Matthew Perry passing!? Crazy reference there
Keith is bridezilla
Keith: Butter makes the batter better Me: A better brand of beef makes a butter burger better
I wanna see the try guys on Nailed It
I think if a potential accident happens in their episode where someone could have potentially got hurt, they should be allowed to get their time back that they loss.
I've never been such a frustrated canadian as I was watching Keith choose HONEY over MAPLE to represent a "flavour from a tree" 🤣🤣
I feel for Marissa. Marrying young is a choice and some work, some won't. Married my college sweetheart at 22 and we're coming up on 10 years, but it is TOUGH.
"It tastes like the sandwitch part of an icecream sandwitch My mom´s favorite-NOo..."
as a pastry chef, this hurts me 😩😩
Marissa served in her judging outfit! She ate 🖤
“Today we’re all wife guys” killed me 😭
Keith's Bridezilla moment was everything lol
Your boss walks into your office in a wedding dress yelling about how dry his cake is and thats just a normal day. 😂 "in that dress!"
I love Marissa’s energy, hoping she returns in future seasons!
The volume of the laugh that came out my mouth when Eugene’s mum said he didn’t have talent 😂😭
I love that Johnny stops everything to praise how much Zach has improved.
32:44 did anyone think of the Greys Anatomy episode when the guys swallowed 10 Judy dolls? 😭😭😂
Zach is a real one 😂
The Wife Guys comment has me in tears OMFG hahaha
Eugene was so nice helping her
I love Marissa! Definitely want to see more of her. She vibes so well w/ the guys.
“We’re ALL wife guys” - I’ve just started watching and I’m already cackling. 😂
They've all improved so much and the broken heart was great. Honestly they all looked amazing. I wondered whether anyone had vetted the food safety of the flowers and it looks like they did not, heh
johnny was so sweet to zach! besties for real
Not putting any funny clip at the end of the video is like intermittent reinforcement for dogs. Train us to watch the video until the end every time but we don’t always get a treat. I understand how a dog feels during this type of training now. Betrayal.
Is anyone else in love with Marissa? Please being her back!!!
we're all wife guys lmao gagged
I spit out my soup at Zach saying “we’re all wife guys”😂😂😂😂
I love how Eugene was so sweet with Marissa, making sure she wasn't freaking out and helping her get level. Just subtly making sure she's okay
i was praying zack would win mainly cause i thought itd be funny
Some foods don't translate from smell to flavor very well.  Pine is difficult to do especially baking, baking will null a lot of flavor.  If I were to create pine flavor I would add a teensy bit of liquid smoke, steeped spruce tips 24 hours in light syrup, zest of some yuzu, pinch of spearmint, then somehow get some menthol like they do in icy chocolates into the icing and smoke some pinecones during the unveil.  Pine is really delicate even cream can over power it.
Marissa's ideas are always so creative
I wish I still had some of my wedding cake. It was vanilla cake with chocolate ganache filling and white chocolate frosting. It was sooooo delicious.
zach's cake looks like a glittery dalek
Marissa is so pretty! Her skin is flawless!
So no one is going to say anything about Zach saying they’re all wife guys?!!
Noooo Eugene taking over, keeping her calm and figuring out a Plan B for her!!!!!! Literally crying they’ve grown so much!
I audibly gasp when Zac got the cake mixed right.
hey guys what r u gonna make during the live, my girlfriend wants to know, thanks.
I cream pied Johnny. Twice.
i will never tire of how positive jonny always is
Marissa did that!
eugene calming marissa down was big daddy energy
What I love about WAR is that it really shows you how creativity flourishes and novel ideas can be discovered in chaotic and unplanned circumstances! Kind of like the unhindered freedom to create that kids feel, that's eventually refined but probably suppressed as we age and learn better techniques, but that knowledge is a burden! ❤
Marissa and Johnny collab?? ❤
Eugene calling his mom and being slammed for not being a good cook is TOP TIER asian and comedy 🎉🎉🎉
52:05 I love this interaction: Keith: I GOT FOURTH PLACE!?! ME THE BLUSHING BRIDE!! Desiree: IN THAT DRESS!?
The disco cake brought me so much joy, the little toppers were the best
Today we are all Wife Guys 😂
At 12:06 THE SIGN IN THE BACKGROUND AFTER KEITH SAID IT IM DEAAADDDD
Ngl imagining a WAR with Miles as a contestant would be a WONDERFUL episode
I'm CACKLING at Keith's meltdown. 😂
Keith having a bride meltdown in that dress was way too perfect
Can we rename it “Poisoning the judges”?😂
Do not watch when your baby is sleeping on you 😂 I was holding in so many laughs
“Love doesn’t always win,  and go forth tits out.” My new motto! She is an absolute national treasure!
Jonny’s “not to be condescending or patronizing but [poisonous] flower juice is the least of your worries today” absolutely sent me😂😂😂
I love both Zach's Stanley Tucci shirt and Eugene's magic eye shirt!!!
Damn Marissa is so beautiful
THIS EPISODE WAS FREAKING EPIC
I can't keep liking all the comments!!!
Eugene’s mother read him to FILTH “I don’t think you have much of a talent in baking but you do have a talent in eating” GIRL! Ms.Yang as a judge on without a recipe WHEN?
Go fourth, tits out. Amen ✨
this episode is so wholesome, my god. i love these vibes so so so much
Johnny is just so wholesome and sweet. I love how proud he is of how far everyone has come with their baking. So sweet and cute.
THERES A BUTTER MAKES THE BATTER BETTER HONEY SIGN BEHIND JHONNY
Best wedding cake i had was an ice cream cake aha
Eugene's mom was unintentionally so shady and I live!!
"In that dress?!?" took me OUT.
LDAW&GFTO
Why does Keith's dress fit so well oh my god he looks great
This was a fun video but I was really disappointed that Nicole’s cakes and baking expertise was not showed more throughout the video. Her cakes are gorgeous and I wish we had heard more from/about her.
I’m also divorced! But I do ALWAYS eat wedding cake 🤤
Marissa...your boobs look so good !!! Literally talked about them the whole episode
"Today we are all wife guys" fucking dead 😂
Idk how I never realized how tall Eugene is. That man looked like a skyscraper next to Marissa
Actually so proud of Marissa
omg im crushing on Marissa ❤ i hope she's not straight! 🤞
Ok, not the "Butter Makes the Batter Better Honey" being behind Johnny as he's cooking!
I’ve said it before and I will say it again put Keith in a dress or wig and you get a whole new person 😂
I also absolutely LOVE floors.
Marissa making divorce jokes at every chance she gets is hilarious 😭😭
daaaamn Where has Marissa been my whole LIFE!!! 😍😍😍
“We are all wife guys”🤣🤣
I'ma fight you guys, I loved WAR Road Trip despite Someone. 😂
this episode was incredible omgggggggg
Omg JONNY 😅
Damn Keith is not Angry Keith hes Angry Bride :D
Am I crazy, or does Keith's "pine" look nothing like pine?
Fun episode! Looked hard but i loved the divorce cake.  Also that dress 😮
The Asian parent response hit a little too close to home LMAO
Can you guys make Zach Nation, Keith Cult, and Eugene Commune shirts please??? 🥺
Love that Zach mentioned trolls
"Go forth, tits out"   Me currently breastfeeding so tits are out  Fck yeah!
Just once I want someone in a security shirt to “escort” Keith off when he loses 😂
Keith losing his mind at 4th place in that dress is e v e r y t h i n g
oh my gOd zach just coming out of the gate with "today, we're ALL wife guys" SENT ME HFDJSKHDJ
Marissa oh my god I think it’s amazing that she baked a good cake
SPOILER:      Keith placing 4th when 2/3 of Eugene’s cake was poisonous has me in tears. We’ve all been blessed by his bridezilla meltdown
Free 🍉🍉🍉 Call for a cease 🔥 now!!!
How is no one talking about Zack saying “we’re all wife guys” like what💀💀💀
Eugene almost killing the judges 😂☠
Based on Jonny's comments for Marissa, can we team them up for some baking projects where he takes her under his wing and teaches her his ways? Something educational but also sure to be entertaining since they are both delightful?
The moment Eugene put on the Hydrangea I had a thought "Isn't that toxic?" 😂
Yes!!! no one wants wedding cake, have something more accessible and fun lol we had a 'cake' made of cheese wheels and wheels of quince paste to go with all that wine!
With ro in a wedding dress and jonny in a tux and them sitting together, they look like they're getting married and if they did, they'd have THE best wedding cake ever  Also everyone looks so beautiful in their wedding best. Im glad they didn't all do tuxes and wedding dresses, they got some good variety in there.
Marisa is so imaginative and inventive with her recipes!! I hope she begins cooking/baking for real. She's always so intentional when she cooks/bakes.
❤❤
Rosanna knowing exactly what reaction the decision will elicit is probably the funniest buildup to a Keith in 4th place result.
I am a big fan of Marissa as a fellow divorcee 😌✌🏻
The divorce broken heart cake is so cool looking but OMG all that black and red food coloring would just destroy your bowels.
"today we're all wife guys" okay zach we get it youre hilarious /silly
eugene coming in clutch with the supportive cool down!
Marissa should be on Nailed It!!
eugene will always be my winner
Keith's meltdown is always concerning nd seems really disrespectful to everyone present there
Where did Qwesi go!? Edit, there's Qwesi ❤
loved this episode, don’t love keith’s yelling. take the l like a champ, dont be scary
I have been swallowing Barbie heads for years. Glad my lifestyle just got a shout out.
Johnny is so relatable talking about barbie head kinks xD I'm also inappropriately bring up whatever comes to mind
Marissa beating herself up for being slow hurt my heart! Girl we all have our own timing and you were just vibing.
I adore Marissa's cake! She looked stunning and the cake was stunning 🖤
whoever edited this video wow thank you bc this is the most well edited w out a recipe ever
Eugene calming and helping Marissa was everything
Min is a fucking legend XD
all of these cakes look soooo beautiful!! also yas Keith in the wedding dress!!!!!!!!!!!
Okay I wanna see an episode where experts make something without a recipe. I know there are people who create recipes so I want to see the process. What could an expert actually come up with on a time crunch? What unexpected hurdles would be there? Because so many of the expert parts of these videos say “yeah, no we wouldn’t attempt this without a recipe” and I want to see if they could actually pull it off.
Mr.Cakes dropping so much TMI in this judging 😂😂😂😂😂
23:08 Eugene helping Marissa was such an unexpectedly, wholesome good friend moment.
Keith: They’re staring, do you feel the stairs?
zach gave them the cake of a killer, bella
I'm honestly obsessed  *SPOILER*                          with that fact that the divorce cake won the wedding cake episode. I'm so happy.
*eyeing keith* id wedding THAT cake
Keith is just one more 4th place away from going Hannibal Lector on the judge panel. Seriously, you can look into his eyes and see how close to the edge he is. Maybe handcuff him on the next WAR episode, lol.
I love how calm Keith Eugene and Zach are under pressure now compared to the first ever without a recipe haha
I love that the flashback doesn't help Keith at all 😂
I currently have a cough and I was not ready to laugh that hard due to Eugene's mother. I couldn't breathe😂
YEAH! GO MARISSA!! (And Eugene, your look to the screen on the call with your mom like "Asian people, YOU know." Hahahah)
“We’re all wife guys” omgggggg
MARISSA ATE THAT ATE THEM UP SHE CAME TO SERVE AND EAT
6:42 my dad was married and divorced 3 time so far in my 27 years of life and it was annoying af every. single. time.
Keith being dramatic is my favorite lmao. So proud of them all 😊
I feel bad when they make a recipe in honor of someone and it doesn't work out. Maybe they should make a recipe in honor of someone they hate.
When Keith gets angry he turns into Tamatoa from Moana. Fact!
I am so here for   Bridezilla Keith 😂 Eugene poisoning judges Zach's Dalek Marissa's potential Eugene's mom roasting him  Great ep!
I love marissa soso much, she brightens my day .. the whole cast is lovely!!! ❤❤🎉
marissa making a BANGER cake and looking so good in this episode! so proud of her!
Really like the sound of Marissas cake. Yummy
I can’t with zachs looking like a Dalek 😭
@tryguys Wait can someone tell me i'm not crazy??????? The vid says the Live tomorrow starts at 6, but the website I went to says it starts at 9! Which is the real one?????
Loving the addition of Marissa this season! She’s so lovely and adorable, and her quiet little asides during the judging sometimes go unnoticed by the other guys but they always make me laugh. MORE MARISSA!!
just so you guys know, keith yelling isn’t that fun for everyone. a lot of the times it reminds me of the abuse i heard growing up— maybe just try to take it into consideration please
Im just saying with how mich shes mentioned when is @clairesaffitz coming on the try guys?
zach hitting me with the “we’re All wife guys” fucking Took Me Out 😭😭😭
The more Eugene tries to hate love, the more we can see he is just so full of ...it. I stan and ship Marissa and Eugene. Oma! I feel like Eugene's cake fully represented their relationship. Beautiful, complicated, poisonous, but full of loving surprises.  Kieth! I was so surprised and how dry was it?
I can’t stop staring at Keith in this wedding dress.  The neckline is so incredibly flattering I forget I’m watching Keith in a wedding dress and not a beautiful bride.
I want to say I love SIX the musical references in this video especially as a SIX the musical fan myself!!
Who knew something could be funnier than children of divorce jokes? (It's Marissa's divorce jokes!)
Did anyone notice the actual sign “Butter makes the batter better honey” 😂
when keith accidentally becomes a great wrestling promo
Zach: One more chance... Me: This is the last chance to get it right!
I love that this video went from "...to enjoy the feeling of them moving inside them" and then smash cut into a peppy holiday commercial. Enjoy Barbie vore with your family and friends this holiday season!
Something about Keiths cake makes me think of a banana slug/random slug even if its not yellow
IDEA! TEAMS! Next without a recipe have a twist by doing teams 🎉
Can we talk about how Jonny was an absolute King encouraging Marissa to keep baking? 🎉🎉 Absolutely heart warming.
I think accidentally sweet Eugene is my favorite of his themes! ❤
I love how the judge guessed it was stairs despite never being on the show before
I demand “Go Forth Tits Out” merch stat
Goddang Marissa is smoking this episode
Johnny and I had the same reaction to Eugene's mom saying he has a talent for eating 😂
Without a recipe rice krispy treats, cake pop, or caramel apples next!
*80% of the audience Google ”kink of swallowing baby heads”* - thanks for that one mr.Cakes😂😂
Love doesnt always win, and go forth, tits out. 🫡
Love when Eugene goes all big brother vibes
Have they considered the many benefits of metal bowls?
I love the videos with Marissa!
I think Keith took Jonny's advice to "literally mix your cakes by hand" a little *too* seriously.
Absolute respect to the editor who put the "butter makes the batter better honey" sign up behind Jonny for how hard that made me laugh  11:55
I'm one of those 50 year olds standing around eating cake (I'm actually 24 tho lol)
Eugene's call to his mom had be BURSTING out laughing LOLLL
"Today, we're ALL wife guys" 💀💀
I just bought my ticket!!! And tomorrows my day off
"In that dress?!" Love Desiree
Marrisa being divorced is iconic
Rosanna looks gorgeous!!
Angry Keith is back, and in a dress.
It’s kinda really sweet that everyone helped each other with the baking and decorating, I love to see it
oh this was the best episode yet!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Perfect episode.
Whether she intended to or not, Marissa represented yet another hint to Taylor Swift's Reputation era... love that haha
Genuinely this is the best everyones done collectively!! They looked great and pulled off what they were going for.
I love Zach and Keith bromance moments
Between Zach’s open liner and Eugene’s mom… this is my favorite episode 😂😂😂
The fact that there's a sign with Keith's quote behind Johnny is hilarious to me 😂
I love tha tthe universal language if a badass woman, is one who slicks their hair back >:)
Felicitaciones, Marissa! 🎉
The Barbie heads omg 💀 I love Jonny
Say what you like, but Keith's presentation had me in hysterics. You might even call it ... top tier.  Ok I'll leave.
I love how kind Eugene was to Marisa helping her with her filling and calming her down.
The ungodly noise that came out of me when johnny said cash register
eugene, melissa and johnny in one episode.. this was so much fun! eugene had me laughing out loud so many times
Today we’re all wife guys 😭😭😭😭
OMG the butter makes the batter better honey sign behind Jonny! What a great easter egg
Eugene poisons the cake and Keith comes in 4th place 👰‍♂️
Can we appreciate the “butter makes the batter better honey” sign behind Jonny after Keith said it lol great editing. Love it.
We can literally see how practice make good work! After all these seasons the judges actually can enjoy every dish
THAT STANLEY TUCCI SHIRT.
a married chemist would totally fit this challenge.
the edited sign behind Jonny adhsjh
I was like they should have the butter makes the batter better honey sign in the back of the next clip or I would’ve been but then there it was
Rachel screaming “NO!” in the background 😂
Very deserved winner!! 👏🏽 i only watch these for keiths meltdowns 😂😂
I remember "butter makes the batter better" from Between the Lions 🦁
eugene really fulfilled the prophecy of “divorced, beheaded, died”
Eugene helping Marissa was really sweet
Thats the best dress Ive seen Keith in! He looks so good.
That dress is doing all sorts of positive things for Keith.
It hasn't even been a minute into the video and Zach is already throwing shade LMAO
Jonny just accidentally adding a whole new dimension to the comedy in these episodes. 😂
So nice to see aubrey plaza take the win
Marissa looks gorgeous, she looks like Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies (my first girl crush cause she was gorgeous too)
“today we’re all wife guys” LMAOOO
Zacks cake looks like a straight up Dalek
I wish they would’ve let the guest judge speak more. I loved her. 💞
I've really been enjoying Marissa on the show! ❤ ✿❧🌿❧✿ ❤
Roe is so sweet
Eugene's mom is savage in a way only an Asian mom can be 😂
Jonny's so proud of them. I love him.
😂 Keith's secondhand embarrassment for Johnny's Barbie head explanation is palpable 😂😂😂
This is video makes me laugh for three reasons: They made cakes and still screw up the basic recipe.  And there is still faith in marriage despite everything that has happened.  And Eugene and Keith dry death cakes symbolizes their exact situation.
Proof that I am turning into my mother:  When Marissa said “I’m divorced” my first thought was “how is she old enough to be divorced?? She’s like,,,15!” 😂😂😂  (This is a compliment btw love you Marissa)
Another amazing season! <3
I lost it went Zach turned around to get suggestions for the cake pun he should use. I'm still laughing about it, Eugene validating him as well really tipped it over the edge for me. Marissa and Keith 'you're probably wrong' was another moment, Marissa has really great chemistry with the guys. I can't believe Eugene called his mom. Good job on your cakes everyone! Cakes are hard to make from scratch as it is. I laughed so much so many times, Johnny was also really funny and I loved the expert Judge she was great.
23:07 the way eugene calmed down marissa and helped her through it was so wholesome😭🙈
I think Keith should have gotten third for creativity alone
Marissa might be my new favorite for w.a.r. I will always be rooting for marissa
Zack saw an opportunity and TOOK IT!
Just starting this and I'm FULL TEAM Eugene and Marissa!
I want a live reaction video from Jonny's mom!
Someone should have told Eugene about the flowers before he put them on the cake tbh
Jonny Cakes is so underrated i swear. The whole 'it was NOT the vibe' killed me xD
"my moms husband recently passed" presents headless groom
This was such a lovely, collaborative episode!! Zach and Keith always kind of function as a tag team when paired together, but when that's matched with Eugene and Marissa being a feedback loop of mutual support, it was all very fuzzy feeling inducing.
Marissa's judging fit was triggering my bi panic
damn zach uninvited her ass kmsl
Can I BE any slower. Chandler would be proud. ❤️💔
Not Eugene's mom roasting him 😂❤
looooool straight men can’t be pillow princesses. nice try Zach 😂
Is anyone else getting 90's sci-fi vibes from Zach's cake?
Video starts at 01:30
RIP Matthew Perry
Rosanna is STUNNING this episode
zach’s shirt in the beginning, i love
damn, everyone brought it this episode!! they all came to play!!
Today we’re all wife guys😊”NO!”
How many eggs will Eugene put in his cake this time?! 😂
That neckline is amazing on Keith!
eugene helping marissa with her filling made me wanna cry, that was so sweet
I’m so sorry you’ve been cancelled 💅🏻💋
This was definitely the best episode so far.
WOW Jonny is doing the demo this time!
By far my favorite episode ever!!! 🎉
Luvv eugine positive sideee
I actually DID watch their Food Network show, and tbh I prefer their youtube show format (no offense)
When Eugene called up his mom I 100% knew she was gonna roast him. 😂
This is going to be fun to watch as a cake decorator 😂
I love Marissa. Her outfit, hair and makeup was fire. And Eugene pulling her off the ledge of a freakout and helping her was such a great moment.
Honestly, I was so positively surprised! They all did so well!!!
I love that Eugene helped pep talk and coach Marissa about her filling! He didn’t let her fail and keep panicking. Love that.
I don't remember exactly when Marissa started appearing in TryGuys videos, but I'm so happy she's a part of the team now. She lights up every video she's in even when she's being as dark as she was in this video. What a true delight.
bring Marissa back next year!!!!!!
Marissa and Eugene were adorable in this episode
Move away Jared! Marissa my new fav. Yo Soy Boricua!!!!!
"Today, we're all wife guys" KILLED ME
Eugene's mom is my favorite. Also, I hope Zach wins the vote during the live
Watching Zach overfill the pans when he was doing so well has me like Obi Wan Kenobi: YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!!
Please bring back Jonny as a judge for many more seasons
As a woman getting divorced.. I loved this video lol
If there’s one thing every version of Eugene is gonna do it’s over mix the hell out of his batter 😂
Loved all the callbacks from previous WAR episodes and Phoning it in — great job y’all and congrats Marissa! 🎉🇵🇷
Eugene's face talking to his mom was the face of a child who knows they're about to get dragged and it was glorious 😂 his mom is an icon
The way Eugene supported Marissa and helped her regroup was so sweet to see. Marissa absolutely slayed 🔥
I want to see jonny react to the video of them making the cakes 😂
Marissa is everything
Eugene is Evil Eugene without even trying - a poisoned wedding cake 😂
The more I learn about Marissa, the more I love her 🎉
Eugene cheering marissa was so sweet
Jonny: Less is more *cuts to Zach's rainbow funfetti disco cake*
When can you watch the final without paying
Oh this was such a fun and nice episode, it was really wholesome!! (aside from the eating barbie heads)
Keiths reactions are always so funny i was crying😭
marissa really made quite the comeback omg!
last night I had a nightmare that I judged without a recipe and accidentally announced the wrong first place winner
Keith always has the best reactions to his placing in these contests😂😂😂
"What's the stuff used for building a wall?"  Trump, care to chip in?
Ro looks so pretty 😭😭
shockingly, this wedding cake themed episode is aro approved XD
I can't believe I love this that much!!!! ur awesome and I also love the animals cuts
As soon as Keith said stairs I knew how it would End…😂
So many jaw dropping spit your coffee out moments in this one lol Johnny spilling the tea in his mom and history teacher has me dead
The music with zacks part.. all I listen  is Pass it on.. from Sorted food 😂❤
Marissa reminds me of Louise and Madeline from gilmore girls. I just LOVE her
I would like to thank Marissa for giving me a new life moto at the end of this video. I will be going forth tits out
Are they not given pastry bags and tips??
Oh my gosh, Eugene's call to his mom was amazing. My cousins and I decorated xmas cookies last wknd and my grandpa (also named Eugene!) said they looked "sub-par" 😂😂😂 i guess since we arent kids anymore they dont sugar-coat it!!
Divorce should not be just as  celebrated as getting married 🤦🏻‍♀️ this worlds so twisted
First, thank you for dropping this early. Second, I am so sick of Eugene not trying he knows good and well not to dump all that cocoa powder into the bowl isn’t the to do your best? It takes me out of it at least try damn.
Eugene telling Marissa to put her hands up  with so much worry for her cause the broken glass was everywhere was so sweet ❤❤😢🥺🥺🥺
Best episode ever 🤵‍♂️🤵🏻‍♂️🤵🏼‍♂️🤵🏻‍♀️
This is the best series to date, to see the veterans (try guys) be so supportive of the new crew is so heartwarming. I feel like this has gone from a competition to we all want everyone to do well. Last year thrived because of the editors , this year the guys made this thrive
As a florist I watch what flowers they put into cakes and as soon as I see baby's breath I cringe. It's toxic. So is gum and other common plants they use
YESSSS MARISSAAAA
The "butter makes the batter better honey" sign edited in behind Jonny lol.
I would date Marissa in a heart beat... that wet look ❤
😂 😂 😂 Lmao Eugene calling his mum was just too funny.
"Today we are all wife guy" He looked so proud of himself for that one
THey improved so much since last time they did cakes
i love marissa. she's levelling up this whole bunch, I absolutely love it.
I'm honestly so proud of Marissa, not only did she make a cake to celebrate her freedom in some way, but it also got her comments to try something new in her future. She has come a long way, can't wait to see when she gives us more!
Marissa is soooo adorable <3
I love how Johnny always cheers them on, love this series!!!!❤❤❤ love the guys
Why does the thumbnail look like they're all trying to avoid looking at Marissa's chest?
this was such a good episode, like the best one this season😭❤
Marissa looks so beautiful and glowing when she says she’s gonna make a divorce cake. You go Queen <3
Keith being a bridezilla is iconic.
Johnny telling Marissa "you've got a future, kid" and her subsequent reaction just gave me so many feel-good tingles 🥺❤ Congrats on the win Marissa!
Zac shading the gingerbread episode throughout is amazing 💀
Eugene's mom is so savage lmao
Marissa is looking 🔥🔥🔥
but fr fr, CAN WE PLZ HAVE PAUL AND PRUE AS JUDGES SOME TIME SOON?
I LOVED Marissa on this season, hope to see her more often!!!
MARISSSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Keiths face when he got 4th place is priceless PLS
Desiree yelling "In that dress?!" had me holleringgggg😭 love bridezilla Keith😭😭
The example cake recipe sucks.
The wife guy comment 💀💀💀
im so glad they said smt about the flowers being poisonous- and i also kinda wish that was something they did tell them
Marissa is ROCKING that slick backed black!!!
random but if zach became an actual baker his bakery would totally be like a children’s bakery, like his ~thing~ would be that, I noticed he always gravitates towards bright colors and childlike creativity and wacky ingredients like m&ms and pretzels and oreos etc. things little kids would just love
I’m screaming laughing at the conversation with Eugene’s mom. How funny!!! She’s a gem. Congrats Marissa!!
I would love to see a mini series where johnny recreates all these cakes in a more “professional” way lol
ZACHARY!!!🤣
i don't understand how eugene passed the "is it a wedding cake" criteria seing as how his cake was, statistically, two-thirds poison. i know it was probably art department's fault, but still, thank goodness they had a pro there or this would be the last "without a recipe" the try guys ever did, and even worse, would probably result in another snl parody.
Eugene telling Marissa to keep her hands up when the glass broke and sternly telling her to make a backup....Daddy energy! ❤
I love how through his face you can tell how invested Keith really is. 😊
Marissa coming to play, looking like Jamie Lee in True Lies!!
Sorry to keep thirsting after Marissa, but damn.
This episode is SO ICONIC
As soon as Clarissa picked divorce cake I knew she won this episode.
im so proud of marissa!
I feel like someone should have known about the poison flowers before it was put into the cake 😅😬
00:30 too soon?
Keith really took the “mix the batter by hand to heart”! Just not in the way it was intended I think 😂
Eugene is a true girls girl for helping Marissa through her struggle about her filling
“It’s giving dusty” 😂😂😂 oh Jonny 🤦🏽‍♀️💀
Actually cried when Marissa won. Jonnys speech was so heartfelt and precious. Go forth with tits out
Eugene is doing amazing this season! He didn`t get any 4th places and he is so sweet and caring and the flavours he picks are so elegant and bougie...and his cake looked the best(at least to me).To be honest I didn`t expect him to do this good!  Marissa did unexpectedly great too!  This season is so strong for everyone!
Marissa's cake looked good while she was making it! And EUGENE IS SO SWEEET, he helped save her filling ❤
I am SO HAPPY for Marissa, her theme and flavour combo was instantly my favourite and I hope Jonny will take her under is wing <3
You know what Eugene's accidental creations should be reworked and added to an actual restaurant menu because he does the most and yet still manages to make some true masterpieces 😂.
TODAY WERE ALL WIFE GUYS YES LMAO
This was so shockingly successful!? The GROWTH
"Today we're all wife guys." Oh the burn!
ON A WEDNESDAY????
Marissa killed it this episode!!
I’ve made a divorce cake for my friend! Love Marissa’s idea
Eugene talking to his mom on the phone needs to be it’s own show 😅😂😂😂
I thought the stair cake kind of looked like a headstone 😂😅
"the show that no one watched" hey i watched it :((
I just gotta say, Keith looks good in the dress. What an adorable man
Keith's crazy eyes during the judging get me every time
Marissa deserved that win. It was rough for her  throughout but, she pulled through with Eugenes help.
This was a heartwarming episode 💕 yaay for Marissa! Go you!
I love Zach’s shirt
Marissa with her hair slicked back, in a black short dress. WOW ❤
OKAY EDITORS, I saw that "Butter Makes the Batter Better Honey" superimposed onto the kitchen backsplash 😂
I can’t stop laughing over Keith’s meltdown
Yeah Marissa!!!!!
“We are all wife guys”
Marissa getting divorced to find inspiration for her cake may be the most commitment we’ve seen over this show so far
Please start making these 2 hours 😭😭😭
Keith looks adorable
Eugene becoming so serious in giving suggestions to Marissa was so cute and sweet! ‘Tis truly the season of cute Eugene
The judging table looks like a couple doing an intimate courthouse wedding officiated by their mutual friend, who then surprised them with their closest circle of eclectic friends who you could only imagine in a fever dream. 😂
marissa is soooo cute
I love seeing Eugene help Melissa when she starts freaking out. He's such a softie sometimes. Her going from "i can't do this! I can't do this!" To "i think i can save this" because of Eugenes' emotional support is so sweet. And the fact that she ended up winning really goes to show you what support from friends can do.
loved this episode :)) congratz to the divorcee!
Man every time they do the shouting tantrum bit I HATE IT. HATE. IT. It's so uncomfortable. I cannot understate this.
Man Keith really turned in to a bridezilla there.
The best cake won 💓
Ok I can’t be the only one who thinks Marissa looks like April from the office
Eugene is so real, my parents got divorced when I was like 5 and only recently did I realize that my mom's parents are still together and that made me get why we are so different 😭😭😭
Bridezilla Keith 😢🤪💔
Imagine if Marissa is a judge next season oml
Well what I've learned from life and GoT....  A wedding cake,, ain't a wedding cake without poison in it.
5:12 LOVE LOSES my favorite trope in modern media
Eugene overmixing his batter is sending flashbacks to the first cake video...
Johnny being so heartfelt to Marissa nearly brought tears to my eyes 🥹
Way to go editors for putting a sign behind Johnny that says “butter makes the batter better honey” 🤣
johnny is so charismatic, i love when he's in a video ^_^
going to be graduating at the exact time of the livestream tomorrow... so sad to miss it live, but so glad I will be able to watch the recorded version with my ticket!
I GASPED when the divorce cake was revealed! honestly one of the coolest cakes I've ever seen
Eugene looks stunning in Hanbok!
Marissa shows that slow is better she did amazingly with the super kind help from Eugene loved this episode and hope to see more from Marissa
"Go forth, TITS OUT" needs to be a tee so quickly. Also Keith's playback of judges' commentary being exactly opposite of what he thought was so funny.
i sPAT OUT my DRINK when zach said 'today we're all WIFE GUYS'
Eugene coming in clutch on that plan b 🥹
i think Keith just gave me my wedding cake idea
Keith freaking out every episode during judging is my reason to live
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Johnny tapping the table in excitement when Keith stands up to throw his fit lolololololol
Eugene is an absolute menace in the kitchen and I love it
i would like to say i watched the show no one watched
This is one of my favorite episodes of without a recipe ever, definitely favorite for the season. Eugene discovering an unexpected anti-marriage establishment ally in Marissa is awesome. Also, everyone being in outfits not out of place at a wedding for judging is top tier (of cake?). I never dreamed of getting married and starting life as a housewife after high school or college. My dream was wanting to go to college and become a respected scholar. Now if only my audience would grow wider than just my nauseatingly sentimental, Dory level forgetful and delusional mother. Eugene would hate her and I take comfort in that at least. The world is biased against non heteronormative people (I am demisexual.), and especially against physically/mentally disabled people (Among other issues I battle daily, Asperger’s Syndrome is the ASD I was born with.) the minute most “Muggles” hear the word disability, it is treated the same as if you said leprosy, cancer, or some other “embarrassing incurable disease”. You never hear about disabled people getting jobs equal to their education and experience; socializing with people with common, higher thinking power interests; nor falling in love, never mind getting married. That doesn’t give me much hope for my personal future despite being able to ‘cheer’ through gritted teeth for others.
This is my favorite episode ever, I screamed in excitement for Marissa! ❤
Eugene and Marissa cooking together is amazing!! ❤
Marissa is just stunning in every way.
Keith's white girl persona makes me think this is Ro and Jonny's wedding and Keith is that girl friend that came dressed in white bc she thought it was more of a beige
I wish that i could watch this year live, i watched last year and it was amazing.
"today, we're all wife guys" STARTING OFF WITH A BANG!!
Marissa is absolutely slaying the dress, the look and she slayed the cake. And the fact that Johnny basically gave her a job offer right then and there based on a cake that almost caused her a breakdown is so wholesome. It was really great to see Eugene also step in to calm her down by offering a logical solution before she could spiral further.   Also the look she had when Johnny told her she had a future in the baking world literally cured me of all my stress at the moment. Amazing for her and if she wants to pursue it, I only wish the best for her!
Heh... more like the DRY Guys, amiright!? Heh...   I'm so sorry.
Marissa set out to just beat Zach in every episode and has successfully done so
“Today we’re all wife guys” convinced me the new phase has begun
I love how supportive Jonny is because he's super aware of how impressive it is that ANY of THEIR cakes are standing
hear me out…the try guys make mochi without a recipe
The butter makes batter better honey SIGN  The editors are too good
this was great😂
52:10 "in that dress?" IM IN TEARSSS 😂😂😂😂
God, I love Keith's tantrums
Leave it to Eugene to set out to make a nice, sentimental wedding cake and it ends up with a decapitated groom and full of poison 😂 Evil Eugene will always prevail!!!
This episode is definitely my favourite Try Guys video. I'm so proud of all of them, especially Marissa, and loved the unique energy each one of them (including the judges) brought to this episode. I audibly laughed so many times.
can a summary video of the finale be posted for those of us who are broke and work during the show
"We're all wife guys" I almost died 😂😂
I really liked how Eugene very calmly told her that she needs a plan B and gave his time and ingredients to make sure Marissa has a cake to represent.
"Today we're all wife guys" ZACH I AM SCREAMING
Zach's cake looks like a Dalek from Doctor Who
Eugene is so Magnus Bane coded
I love how Keith went from screaming at the judges to calmly explaining to Marissa that she wasn‘t the one who insulted him back to him screaming 😂😂😂
Keith definitely went into Bridezella mode.
Probably one of my favorite WAR episodes. So many good moments I can't wait to rewatch in compilations. A little bit of sugar, spice, everything nice, and forbidden kink lore.
Can somebody tell me why it is /live now instead og /war?
Keith should've done a Bridezilla cake.
Oh gosh I love Jonny (and I wrote this comment after the barbie thing I really needed to know that thank you)
This episode in the best of this series. The ambiance is so wholesome and lovely. Eugene helping and supporting the others, Keith going bridezilla in a wedding dress, Zach zaching around and Marissa hopefully finding a new hobby to do. The cakes are all awesome, you can see how supportive the all are to each other. Jonny is such a great judge, I hope we will see him back next season. This is hands down the best Without a Recipe episode and one of the best Try Guys videos.  I would also like to add that I would love to see a Without a recipe season where the Try Guys are the judges and Rosanna and Jonny are the participants. So many of the judges who show us how to make something, say "I would not make it without a recipe", I would like to see them do it.
Angry Keith is back
Keith And Zac are in the top two  because they are the CEOs. Of the company lol congratulations guys so proud   Jared is so proud of you as well.
Not Zach making a wife guy joke just a few seconds in. I had to stop and quit laughing before I even got started watching properly! I loved every single thing about this episode!
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Theres people.... who swallow Barbie heads... so they can enjoy.... the feeling of....
WE’REALLWIFEGUYS🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is no one talking about Zach’s wife guy comment 😭
Eugene and Marissa are a fabulous duo together. Would love to see more. They way Eugene helped her stop spiraling and effectively helped her win overall, and then to top it off Marissa giving Eugene credit for his help was beautiful to see. She made that cake, she made that idea, and she not only accepted help when she needed it but she made sure to credit her helper. Truly a beautiful spirit in both souls.
This is the very definition of Toxic Positivity😂. No one should've left this room without being completely Roasted for filth.😂
Baking a wedding cake is something I’m irrationally confident I could do.
This was probably my absolute favorite episode of WAR ever! Loved it
But kieth looks so good in that wedding gown tho
Love loses <3
Keith being a bridezilla 😂
Jonny throwing random shocking facts 😂
AND THEY KEPTK IT IN GOOD JOB ZACH DRAG NEDS ASS
I’m I the only one that’s traumatised by the whole swallowing Barbie head thing😂😂
Keith’s face…every single time sends me 😂😂
Zach to Marissa: “You’re not going to be invited back next year”
I'm so proud of Marissa! She did so good in this episode!
Keith wearing a DB Studio dress for judging is just so frickin funny to me as a victim of the David’s bankruptcy layoffs back in spring 😂😂😂
I have never loved Eugene more than when he helped Marissa with a plan B. Seriously, I could have cried. As someone who easily panics, his calm and direct approach was so kind.
Eugene's mom is the real MVP of this episode
Eugene accidentally putting ACTUAL POISON onto his cake is somehow the funniest fucking thing to ever occur on this show 😭
Johnny Cakes needs a spot on every baking/judging episode. He makes for the best episodes. 😂😂❤
New comfort episode unlocked
Euegene is so sweet this season, he seems so much happier and lighter? I miss seeing him in videos but I love how Fulfilled he’s become. Also I love having Marissa  around this season
They still have ways to go but I'm happy they are learning from their past mistake.  N Johnny saying to Zach how proud he is cz is the first edible thing his been fed from Zach is priceless   So proud of all of them. Also Ming is awesome 😂
“Love doesn’t always win. And go forth, tits out”
Jonny, please never apologize for your crazy humor. I absolutely love it!!
Okay in the beginning when Eugene leans over and it pans to Keith, it looks like Keith saw Eugene's butt and started blushing really hard 😂😂😂
Not me yelling, “What the hell, Keith??!?” at the phone while watching. 😂
ZACH SAYING WERE ALL WIFE GUYS KILLED ME 🤣🤣
I missed Keith’s rage 😂
“Today, we’re all wife guys….”
Marissa is very much serving Aubrey Plaza in this video and i LOVE it.
Loved it!!!❤
Keith cancelling the judges is iconic
amazing episode
This is quite literally the guys redemption from the first cake video they ever made and actually almost poisoned Ro
the gasp I gusped when Eugene dumped in all the cocoa
Keith looked amazing in that outfit!!! So cute 😊
Can we talk about how good Keith looks in that wedding dress
23:13 made tears well in my eyes 😢❤ I wish I had someone to cheer me on like this when I’m feeling anxious every day
So happy for Marissa's victory! Also Keith getting last place should be enough reason why Rosanna got so anxious with making the announcement 🤣
Not even a minute in and Zach's already making THOSE jokes lol I love it
Appreciation to the editor for sticking the "butter makes the batter better" sign behind Johnny
I hope they warn the guest judges that Keith will likely scream at them for comedic effect lmao
The moment Marissa’s cake was revealed I was ROOTING for her so much, what a truly gorgeous cake. And when the judges said it tasted delicious I squealed out loud with joy!! I’m so happy for her, and Johnny’s kind words made me emotional. What a lovely episode! ❤
All wife guys lmaooo
23:54 aww Eugene was so helpful! So sweet!
Desiree is my favorite try team member, she knows exactly how to instigate
What’s wild is I remember them saying it was dryer than Eugene’s lol haha
Marissa! 🖤
Johnny should take Marrisa as an apprentice
Marissa's divorce cake is everything. Thank you for taking it in that direction!! I just celebrated one year divorced and starting fresh.  Divorce can get lonely fr.
"Today, we are all WIFE GUYS."  I swear I almost choked 😂 Good one Zach. Glad you guys can laugh about it now.
Johnny knows too much
Zack made a dalek cake
Keith “they gave me fourth place!” Des:”IN THAT DRESS?” I love this😂😂😂🫶🏼🫶🏼
Eugene's mum is the ultimate Asian mother with her high expectations. Also can we keep Marissa? I love her, she's a wild card
Would’ve loved to see some more of the guest comments
During the judging Marissa looks SO COOL dressed as a femme fatale divorcee, and hearing her supportive exagerrated "it's so beautifuuuul :D" was an adorable contrast. I'm so glad she was in the finale and paired with Eugene!!
Hands down, Keith looks fucking incredible in that wedding dress, omg!
Marissa serving not only cake with that look!! Loved it!!
Marissa was Cosplaying as Jamie Lee Curtis from true lies. I now have an internet crush
I am SO HAPPY FOR MARISSA!!
EUGENE PUT POISION IN HIS CAKE AND BEAT KEITH??? HUHHH?
I love that, without the veil, Marissa looks like a wedding guest.  With the black viel for her cake is awesome! Way to go,Marissa 🎉  Edit: Congratulations, MARISSA!!!! I wish they gave her a bouquet of flowers for the win
Marissa had great ideas this season, but problems with execution 💔 until the finale. Looking forward to seeing her again.
Eugeeeeeene he's so supportive and so reliable!!! And incredibly warm. Love this ❤ also, Marissa's monologue is my daily internal monologue 😂🥹
In love with Jonny disagreeing with the other two judges lately, he knows to severely underestimate them all 😭
Fondant is expensive, gross, and 99% of the guests don't end up eating it.
Min saying Eugene doesn't have a great talent for baking BUT has a talent for eating has me in stitches.
0:25 woah... its been awhile since a that joke was talked about.
9:41 i am fascinated at jonny using olive oil in his chocolate cake because in college i was trying to make brownies and include my vegan roommate who apparently secretly hated us, and when they found out i used olive oil as the oil in the recipe they made me feel like the stupidest person in the world. I feel vindicated.
I miss matt
I fucking love Keith's dress
Glass Kitchen aid bowls are literally only good for visuals,
Not Eugene’s Mom giving the most Korean parent/elder response 😂
Papa Jonny Cakes was so proud! He’s so sweet!
This was such a nice episode! Definitely my favorite this season😊
Everyone looks amalzing, Marissa and Eugene especially!
When Keith said “the next step” I was convinced he was going to make another foot cake 😂
Here to show my appreciation for Jhonny and Zach friendship❤
I love the judging on this video!! very nice comments (great job marissa!) and no one was screaming!! except the bride... but great wedding reception!!
@56:13 keith i will always vote for my fellow Tennesseen you will alway be #1 in my head but in taste... i might have to go with
"Love doesn't always win - and go forth, tits out." That's a great way to live life, if I've ever heard one!
they should invest in the metal bowls for the kitchenaid mixers, haha
omg way to go marissa!!!!!! zach an honest well deserved 2nd place ❤❤🎉🎉
tits out bbaybeeee!
The judges being critical while Jonny is just happy it was better than before 😂
Whoever decided to edit the "butter makes the batter better"-sign behind Jonny after Keith said that deserves a raise! 😂
Eugene 's mom really went for the kill
god bless eugenes momma she is just so dry humored and honest
Eugene’s mom is a vicious treasure
Lol who expected praise from an ASIAN MOM. 😂😂😂
On the rare occasion I've been to a wedding, you better be damn skippy I ate that fucking wedding cake
Somebody ban Eugene from stand mixers
Hi Johnny’s Mom and History Teacher Husband!! 😂
What Jonny said to Marissa made me cry omg 🥹 The sincerity of it was just so damn touching
Marissa's presentation was *on point.* She was a delightful contestant!!!
it might be just me but Zachs cake reminds me of a Dalek from Doctor Who lol
Looks like they're The Dry Guys now.
Jonnys talk to marissa really almost has me in tears 🥺🥺
This week we're all wedding guys 😂😂😂
discocake but pronounced like bukake
Enjoy DIS CAKE! 🤣
My favorite moment in each episode is when Eugene smirks to the camera and wildly pours something (liquor, sugar, cocoa powder) into his bowl without looking 😂
Keith took wife guy to a whole new level
Marissa winning made me cry!!!!!!!
The world is full of kink😂
having someone who's divorced be the fourth on a show where it was originally you-know-who is SO funny. also i just love marissa she's such a delight
Could the mystery event be Eugene’s wedding? Is that why he will be too busy next year? Will that be one of the mystery events?
Zach saying ‘now we’re all wife guys’ 😵‍💫👀🤣 the shadeeee
Keith's outburst was hilarious, hahahahahaha. I always love his outbursts in all without a recipe eps.
without a recipe is by far my favorite series you guys do!! please keep it coming because it’s so entertaining🙏can’t wait for the live tmr!!
Whoever put that sign saying “butter makes the batter better honey” in the background of Johnny after Keith said it 👏👏👏👏👏
Gotta add Zach's shirt to my Tucci Log.
I'm watching this at work and that moment where Eugene called his mom has me in TEARS
The way i want to say SLAYYYY QUEEEN everytime keith walked in that wedding dress...
Jonny telling all his mommas business lmaooooooo
9 mins in “Zach is 100% correct” okay so, how does he ruin it
Marissa in that outfit oh my god I'm so gay
the supportive and destructive nature of eugene and marissa is just so much fun!
Eugene's mom almost made me die of laughter. What a queen! I can see where Eugene gets his humor from. <3
Eugene, I'm so proud of you, you are such an amazing soul. 🤍
Eugene's cake could be "Divorced, beheaded, died"
Eugene really said divorce, beheaded, died.  Not in that order but iykyk😅
This episode was fun. My wedding cake (19 years ago) was freaking delicious. It was so good that we took the leftovers of the base home and when I left for my honeymoon my family served it at a Rose Bowl party. And then when we got back we decided to use the top layer for a family birthday party rather than freezing it for a year and letting it get gross.  Other than photography, it was the most expensive part of the wedding though
Jonny is just a hot mess this episode and I love to see it
Jonny's reaction at Zach's cake especially after eating that horrendous baking powder filled one from before, is just priceless 37:41. I JUST LOVE HIS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND HIS EXCITEMENT
We all know that the *real* winner of this episode, is Eugene's mom.
Clearly my favorite episode ever! Everyone did so good and every cake seems to have been somewhat enjoyable to eat! And what a come back for Marissa!
Is Eugene purposely over mixing his batter on purpose? As a baker, all I can think is holy fuck!
Is it Saturday already?
"Nothing more basic bitch than a Heterosexual Wedding" Zach just spitting facts JAHSJAHAH
This has probably been said but they should create "correct" versions of the winning recipes bc Marissa's honestly sounds soooo good
Asian parents tell me about it 😅
"butter make the batter better honey" cut to jonny cakes with the sign in the background
That Stanley Tucci shirt ‪❤️‍🔥🔥
Eugene’s mom being honest is so asian hahaha
23:13 this has me crying. Eugene’s big brother moment here makes me so happy and it’s such an amazing moment tbh.
Wait Keith unironically looks so cute in that dress omfg he is Pulling It Off
I so love Marissa's vibe in this episode!!! You go gurl!
i was gonna watch this later but zach said the “wife guys” line and now i’m gonna watch it immediately 😭
who does the dishes when y'all r done?
It's so funny that Eugene almost poisoned the judges and still didn't get last place
This is their first black female judge and business. Why didn't they have her walk us through the cake steps? I would have loved to seen more of her work. We've seen Johnny so much already
omg marissa's cake is visually great!
Whatever I was expecting, Zach being a little troublemaker saying "today we're all wife guys" with a shit eating grin within three minutes of this episode was NOT IT
Eugene's mom sounds like the most korean ajhuma ever XD
Zach's cake reminds me of a Dalek
the "butter makes the batter better honey" being in johnnys kitchen after keith saying it is so funny
4:20 Eugene you are a LIAR. I’m literally in my 20’s and I will have a slice of wedding cake every time I attend a wedding
marissa completely deserved this win I'm so happy she got first place :)
Marissa's cake is so beautiful!!
Keith: 12 eggs!  Me: Oh, god, flashbacks!
All I have to say is I love this show SO FUCKING MUCH. I hope it never ends. Pure gold.
marissa being the winner is the best thing to happen this season
Hahahahahahahahaha 30 seconds in and it’s already perfection
Marissa is puertoroican?! Yesss my PR qweennn!!! 🇵🇷
i agree with johnny about keiths cake being out with the round tier and going straight tier
I love that they don’t *have* to include the weird shit Johnny says but they do anyway cuz they know his anxiety is gonna fucking hate it, and we love to see it 😂 cruel, editors, cruel. But for though Johnny’s lack of filter is one of my fav things about him, neurodivergent King.
"Love doesn't always win and go forth tits out" is 100% hands down no contest my new childless spinster motto 🤘🖤💋
“we’re all wife guys” IM WEAKKK 😭😭
I am definitely actually baking a wedding cake this morning. Perfect 👌🏻
Eugene being so supportive and helping Marissa was so special
Eugene is such a good coach what a kind human
I loooved this episode so much!! Marissa is so funny, Eugene was so sweet and helpful, the stair puns were immaculate and the whole judging was super entertaining! Eugene biting the flower was hilarious
Been waiting for a Keith freak out all season 😂
"you dont have a talent for cooking but you have a talent for eating" made me SCREAM thats such a mom burn that makes you relive your whole life in the worst way
Eugine telling Marissa to look at him and helps her regroup is such a hero/super hero moment. Love! 😍🥰  Edit to add: Keith and Zach teaming up to save Keith's Cake is true friendship  Edit to add: Marissa's speech of getting thru this cake, like divorce, woth the support of friends brought tears to my eyes. 🥹😭
The sign In the back ground that says "butter makes the batter better honey" made me laugh out loud
Fuchsia Fondant would be a great drag name.
I have to say that I was a bit worried about the channel when they introduced the other two contestants, because I don't think they're funny or really contributed anything (mostly very depressing guys..), but Marissa is really funny and a character on her own! I would like to see her more often.
All the outfits at the end are so representative of their personalities, like, if there was a try guys cartoon with a wedding episode this is how they would dress
MARISSA NEEDS TO BE BACK NEXT SEASON!! SHES SO FUN AND GENUINE IT ISNT LIKE SHES PUTTING ON A CHARACTER FOR LAUGHS  ❤❤❤
Ok! KEITH! You win! The Dryest Cake lol 😂
Keith being like , yall not hype enough for my boy zachs cake. "WOW!"
I'm obsessed with how they edit to foreshadow the MAJOR mistakes that they make 😭😭😭
I'm so proud, this whole episode just makes me feel so proud of the cast. Absolute fire of a season, well done everyone!
I'm totally voting for the divorce cake
I'm so glad Marissa won, I was rooting for her! Glorious concept, great execution and so nice to hear Johnny tell her she has a future in this. Amazing, can't wait to see how she continues.
Why does Keith low-key look sexy in the dress
awesome 🎉
Hydrangea sap is NOT milky.  But it does contain cyanide glycosides. And that is SO not pine.  Looks like a juniper.
I missed it by 2 hours 😭
Johnny really said "the theme for this wedding is 'unhinged'" this episode lol. Eugenes mom is always a great cameo!
stooooppppp marissa deserves the world
Eugene turning off chaos mode for a second to ground and help Marissa was so sweet Also I'm so proud of Marissa omg, that cake looked amazing and sounded delicious
Not enough people talk about Eugene's mom, she is so funny
How are there not more comments about Jonny and the Barbie doll heads
really wish the live was put online late, cut down and not live. I cant afford 20 bucks this year to go and i wanna see it. Even if it was like late for 5 bucks, I'd do that, but 20 dollars on a year like this is just too much.
immediately liked after Jonny said the gay wedding was annoying (I am gay)
zachs cake really punches out of the normal wedding cake type so it looks fantastic
Anti-wedding. My mom was divorced three times as of 2023 and all the money lost on dresses, suits, cakes, and places seems dumb. Especially if you are aware of how fragile and unnecessary love is. FUCK LOVE!!
Everyone looked so good in the judging moment!
Y'all are now the try pal's
Eugene stepping in and being a voice of reason for Marissa was heart warming, like that is growth baby!
Zachs "wife guy" comment at the beginning cracked me up. Also, his cake looks like a Dalek😂.
except the flower faff euguenes cake looks amazing
12 hours into an hour is so impressive. Ty editors!
Marissa looks just like Aubrey Plaza in the Thumbnail!
Parasocial relationships are weird but I literally cried at the judging of Marissa's cake!
An episode where everything looks good an edible? What??
Hang on is marissa the first guest star to win an episode? I dont remember that happening before?
LOL when johnny said hydrangeas poisoning was the least of their worries
wish i had the money to see WAR live tomorrow!
I’m only 8 min in and Eugene dumping in what he just dumped in has me so scared
Butter makes the batter better Honey 😂 switches to Johnnys wall
When Rosanna seemed hesitant to announce the 4th place I knew... Boy, I knew!
When Zach said "today we're all wife guys" I wheeze laughed so hard I started coughing up my lungs
I could have gone my whole life without learning that about Barbie heads… thanks for that Johnny. Hate Also Eugene calming Marissa down was so sweet.
omg
28:47 (28:56) okay but seeing eugene's bow of greeting in hanbok was so 🥺🫶 ahh my gay korean heart feels so full!!  this episode had so many hidden gem moments btwn jonny's continued lore (👋 hi jonny's family happy holidays!) and eugene's mom giving the most korean non-compliment (54:15) XD ngl i hope another iteration of cake-driven-madness can come back on WAR someday!
I’m only 5 minutes in but I have to say it feels like Zach and Keith are on the wrong sides.  it’s throwing me off lol
Marissa did amazing and served!! She made a cool cake and looked hot doing it (You slayed marissa
Eugene coaching Marissa to have a Plan B was so heartwarming.  I KNEW that phone call to Eugene's mom would be wild!  AND CONGRATS, MARISSA!
12:07 okay the sign nearly killed me 😂
Keith was so unhinged this episode and I loved it!
Zak with the "wife guy" shade!!! 😂
Ro and Jhonny looking good sitting side by side
Eugene helping Marissa and telling her to make a plan B OMG MY HEART
Keith going bridezilla was funny
Eugene being supportive and just there for Marissa and being all huggy warms my cold heart I love him so much❤
Marissa had the toughest challenges. She did so well!
Im barely 15 minutes in, and I've already said, "Oh no," a thousand times.
Yay Marissa!!! Omg, the journey! The resilience! The problem solving! She did a fantastic job! I want to see a Johnny teaches Marissa to bake series! They can do increasingly difficult recipes and the staff can blind judge!
Barely ten minutes in and Rachel had to run in…. And we’re not even in the live ep yet…
this episode was so messy and chaotic.
Is it bad that I want to see Keith meltdown on the live?😅
Eugene being like the gay best friend to his divorced gal pal is such a mood. XD  I feel like his time off spent pursuing personal projects has really watered the seeds of his soul. He seems so happy and fulfilled and relaxed in the recent videos.
good episode overall
they keep mentioning the show that no one watched. did the show not air because of “the incident”, or did it get bad ratings because of “the incident”?
Can't get over how beautiful everyone's wedding outfit is (especially Ro)
keith looks beautiful in that dress and Eugene lolks great too.Zach and marissa look lovely too
I got 🎉 divorced 🎉 last year, it was NOT amicable, I had to file a police report and get a restraining order and was in and out of court regularly for over a year. I haven't finished the video yet but I'm 100% rooting for Marissa 🥳🎂 Divorced girl squad!
No Eugene ur not supposed to make me this is so sweet 23:11 10:25
keith yelling in the dress has me crying
ok but... Marissa?? 😱😱 ❤🖤❤
48:26 almost made me get a little emotional
Why is Keith wearing my actual wedding dress! LOL
Keith turned to a bridezilla 😅😂
Having had hydrangeas in my yard for the entire 30+ years of my life, I was very baffled that I’d never heard they were poisonous. Very glad a thorough google search finally informed me you’d have to eat a ton of them for any really adverse effects even in dogs and cats because I definitely never knew to watch my dogs around them. 😂
I love how u guys really supported each other in this one
Zach looks so proud of himself for the wife guy joke
AYO ZACH! WHERED U GET THAT SHIRT?
So Proud of Marissa!!! 🖤💔
✨ Great episode. I'm so impressed how far the guys have come and Marissa is such a great addition. I love her vibe 💗  Zach did the recipe! Holy cow! Eugene was smiling almost the entire time 😁 Glad to see it. And Keith got to be the chaotic one and pulled off his artistic vision - it looked great 😃  Jonny is experiencing the Try Guys effect of being less afraid to fail and have fun and I love it. The growth in his confidence with support and humor is obvious. And he is giving that same energy back encouraging Marissa 💕  How is Jonny so dang cute and wholesome while talking about a fetish? 😂
Zach’s cake gives Dalek in the best way.
Matpat would foam for Keith's frosting 19:24
Between Zach starting the episode with "today, we're all wife guys," Johnny's history teacher tidbit and  Min-yeong roasting Eugene live, this has got to be the most jaw dropping Holy Shit episode of recent
Why is Keith working out of what looks like a dirty dish bucket?! 😭😭 Obvi his was probably never used to bus tables at a restaurant!! But that’s all that I associate those bins with in my mind!! Next season episode 1 should be “Food Safety Practices Without A Recipe”!! And they have a guest judge/instructor just whistling at them when they do weird/improper stuff with kitchen utensils and supplies. (Also the state of Eugene’s station is Exhibit B to my argument!!)😭😭
Keith's rant always makes me happy
Marissa is my new favourite and I really hope that she gets to be in more videos on this channel next year especially for WAR videos or even Phoning It In!!
An epic episode!!!
I am SO FREAKING PROUD of Marissa! well-deserved win! 😃also, I know it's a joke but it makes me a lil' sad that the guys keep saying nobody watched their Food Network show because I watched every episode and loved it! ❤
New Johnny and Marissa Baking show on Try Guys WHEN.
The "Butter makes the batter better honey" sign behind Johnny is an incredible detail
today we’re alll wife guys is craxy
Eugene's mom saying he has a talent for eating instead of cooking  killed me 😂😂😂
“You have a great talent for eating” 😂 this is how moms give their kids complexes!!
I love how Eugene manifested the six lyrics with his mom husbands, being divorced and died and now there is a beheaded one 😂😂
Keith having a bridezilla moment is so on brand  52:00
Marissa is a vibe in this.
Marissa reminds me of Tatiana from Jinjer, in this episode for some reason
35:42 It feels really weird to suddenly start hearing the Pass It On music from Sorted Food.
22:25 - 25:31 Yes Eugene, that was Chandler 💔🥺😭.   I miss Matthew so, so, so much. Fly high, beautiful, beautiful angel🤍🕊
I love without a recipe so much! I could watch these all day everyday! The whole staff puts so much work and effort in this m, I really appreciate it m, love from the Netherlands ❤
Cannot stand the "bit" Keith does where he just yells at people and throws a tantrum. Other than that a pretty good episode lol
Dude I am loving Zach's lavender velvety suit. I want it so bad xD it looks so soft
Daaamn. The detail. They added the kitchen sign. 12:04
Marisa looked like Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies and I'm not complaining.
Wow Keith canceling the judges that was the biggest cancellation I've EVER seen and try guys history
Wasn't expecting keith to do alcohol. Went back and looked at Keith's a second time at 26:29. His side boards were sliding. Maybe thats why his back panel fell because the whole thing was moving??!!?? You guys have come a long ways and very proud of all of you!
Not the cameras zooming in on Eugene and me thinking he was going to be in 4th place 😂😂  Keith reaction is always the best when he loses 💀😅
Generissa all 2024
Marissa ate the competition but also her look! i loved the all black with the slick back hair, i think i fell in love with her
"today we're all wife guys" I seriously love these guys omg
Eugene is giving loving big brother energy ❤
This is my all time favorite series but this was hands down the very best most perfect laugh out loud make me cry episode. My goodness. Bravo.
The fact that Keith quite literally mixed his batter by hand 😂😂
Can we please have Johnny teaching Marissa about cake making
how has eugene never been to a gay wedding omg
Nice touch with butter batter sign in kitchen. Great editing
"No one ate the cake at my wedding because Maggie bit it."  That's hilarious and come on you can always just cut that part out!
Eugene was soooo wholesome!  Calming her down first, giving her some ideas for a plan B.  He really was a hero!
Ok but Marissa looked AMAZING in this episode, are you kidding me?! 😍
I'm with Maggie.i would bite the crap outta my own wedding cake 😝😝🤪🤪😜😜😛😛
Adorable Mum shade > shouty whiney man tantrums 😂 x
The way I cheered upon the judges loving Marissa’s divorce cake! Especially since it mirrored Johnny’s beginning!  The flavor combo sounds absolutely delicious, the cake turned out beautiful, the fact that Eugene helped her, (I’m also losing my mind at Johnny’s story about his step-dad)   I just really want people to destigmatize divorce. If people are unhappy together, they should separate, and that a GOOD thing. It means they’ll be happier! So let’s celebrate, as Marissa said, the end of one chapter and the beginning of a new one.   (Also shoutout to Eugene’s poison cake for his mom)
Can't believe Keith divorced all three judges during the wedding cake video
Please make Marissa the fourth try guy
okay guys.. i love you all. but i also know you guys know that this much cocoa powder should not be in a cake ( to Eugene). internet has a weird fascination for wasting foods. don't do that please.   regardless. love your team <3
Hey Keith, you still lost when Eugene literally served poison to the judges. That’s all, hope you have a great day!
it hurts seeing them mixing those ingredients 😂 as a baker
HI JOHNNY'S MOM!!!
Your thumbnail editor really advertising the goods eh?
I don’t like Keith’s shouting.
Jonny is so lovably unhinged 😂 This episode was adorable chaos
So here for Johnny just dumping life lore and "fun facts" and then realising what he said 😂😂😂❤
Marissa winning and graduating from bad baking is the comeback/glow up we needed this season!!!
53:00
Missed opportunity for wedding at the disco, Zach 😂
Eugene being Marissa’s calm voice was amazing.
I think a good takeaway from this episode is everyone did a great job but unfortunately they have to be ranked
as a baker marissa’s cake has inspired me so much, what a lovely flavor combo and her reaction to being told about her potential was the sweetest 🥹 i predict some amazing things from her in the future!!
Keith going Bridezilla at the loss is just hilarious
Someone knew exactly what they were doing in the thumbnail
Marissa's cakes look great actually
“Today we’re all wife guys” sent me!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When I tell you my mouth DROPPED when Jonny said he’s mom got with his world history teacher 😭
Heehee I love how embarrassed Eugene gets when he's called out for being sweet and kind
Looking at zach effortlessly cooking is so calming 😂😂😂 (i haven't seen the results yet so yeah)
Yay Marissa! Go forth tit's out!
Marissa: Love doesn't always win. And go forth, tits out.  a true poet.
Eugene's mom's comment on the phone is such a classic asian parent moment lmaoooo
Omg Eugene's mom roasting him so completely was just too good! 🤣
It fills me with happiness that Rosanna started off introducing herself as “one of the most popular baking shows on the webs”, in earlier videos and then went to “the most popular baking show on the webs”
I’m so in love with Marissa. Way to go for her win!
Loved that start!
"Today, we're all wife guys." ZAAAAAAAAAACH!!!! :D
That wife guys comment had me dying 😅
Eugene's conversation with his mom is so Asian Mom coded
It’s not as unhinged as the Bookake eps.
keith did not forever hold his peace
"Today we're all wife guys"- damn Zach's still not over it :D
Can marissa not be so hot, thanks
AHHHHHHH TODAY WE’RE ALL WIFE GUYS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Aww, Johnny saying all that to Marissa; congrats!! I hope she takes it to heart and pursues it, cuz she did do really good!! ❤
“Oh shit, did you know that your backside fell out?” If I had a nickel…..
We've have enough wife guys thank you though.
Eugene's mom roasting him on speakerphone 😂😭
I’m so happy for Marissa she’s had a rough go this season 😂
I hate Marissa so much. So annoying. Can’t stand her. Should’ve stayed with Jared!!!! Like him so much more >>>>
TODAY WE’RE ALL WIFE GUYS I can’t. I’m really glad they’re able to occasionally make jokes or laugh about it now
I feel like I missed the live event?! Is it not tomorrow, Thurs Dec 14? But this is the finale episode of the season??!
lol. Johnny's so proud of Zach's cake
Marissa 👀👀
Johnny is amazing! Marissa is amazing! Eugene is amazing! I want the three of them together more timesssss.
I hate hate HATE American cakes 😫 they are so dry
cant help but feel like safiya nygaard shout been a judge too
I have to miss WAR live for my wedding tomorrow, so wedding cakes the day before will suffice!
Keith making an "old fashioned floor" is sending me
Marissa is divorced? Slay
Bridezilla in the house!
23:18 not me sobbing at work at eugene's support omg😭😭💕😭💕😭😭  (AND THEN AGAIN AT HER CAKE REVEAL THAT COMBACK, GIRL)
Congratulations Marissa really awesome cake
39 seconds in and I've already almost spit out my drink😂😂😂
I adore Marissa & Eugene 😍💖😍💖
Eugene is so nice for helping her stay motivated to do her cake, I missed him sooo much I’m glad he’s back on without a recipe 🫶🏻
I'm so surprised by Keith's cake because he even used a soak!
OMG!!! Keith at 4th??? Like the worst season ever!! But i'm Proud of Zach.. and of Marissa!! I love her creative tropical flavours.
The slow zoom on kieth painting pine juice on his cake was very telling
zach finally learned that flavor doesnt matter
Fantastic episode. Made me laugh out loud so many times, and brought so much joy to my day. Thanks for that!
Fue mala idea verlo en mi trabajo, muero de risa! 🤣🤣🤣
Eugene's station is a horror show
Eugene’s mom read him for filth!!!!!
keiths idea about his stairs cake go me dying
This was probably the best episode of Without A Recipe so far. It just had really good energy. Very nice vibe. Lots of funny but delightful moments! I loved Keith's attempt at pine flavoring! Pine needle tea is a signature staple of mine and I have made pine icing before. I could definitely see me loving the whisky too (although i don't love orange and would have opted for lemon, the citrus really should have enhanced the flavor profile of the pine and honey tiers). This is one of those cakes that really serves as inspiration for a professional baker and that is fantastic! Eugene's cake would have probably been fine with some floral wrapping and this should have been something that was caught prior to the filming but it looked gorgeous and I loved this whole arc with him and the strong women in his life. Zach's cake was such a unique idea I now have to figure out how to execute it! It's just a delight! Marissa knows she did well but just, wow! Way to recover after a scary start! The way you played off of Eugene was delightful and entertaining from the jump I really have enjoyed your appearances this season for sure. Great job projection, editing team, and judges. This whole package was really good! I don't comment on the YouTubes much but this was top tier, taking it to the next step ❤
I was drinking coffee while Eugene called his mom and during that whole thing i laughed so hard the coffee came out of my nose lol
The barbie head thing tho.. 🤣 is it bad that I knew exactly what you were talking about before you finished the fact 😂😂 I've seen a medical show featuring a person who had done just that lol
Johnny’s comments to Marissa was the sweetest thing ever! 🥹
This and phoning it in are my fav sub series ❤ lmao Keith is my fav so clearly I think he was robbed this episode!
Jonny being worried about his mom and the world history teacher over his kink lesson
Not me thinking I could gift myself a lil thing by getting tickets to the show... then seeing it *starts* at 2am for me 😭
eugene was so kind to marissa, seeing him help her was so sweet :,)
Wow Zachary!!! I am so proud of you!!!!! YOU MADE A CAKE! AND NOT ONLY WAS IT SAFE TO EAT, BUT IT APPARENTLY WAS PRETTY GOOD! YOU’VE COME SO FAR 🥲🥲🥲🥲
I'm so happy for Marissa, she did such a great job !
Eugene dedicating a cake for his mother and making it poisoned makes me feel like she would be proud nonetheless
Eugene's mother is savage 😅 jeeeeez. "You have a talent for eating" dafuq 🤣🤣🤣
very amused that eugene started by making a SIX joke about divorced and died and then completed it by BEHEADING the figurine
To Zach n Eugene I watched the show where you'll made crissont n wedding cake
LOVE that Eugene called his mom for support and she ended up roasting him instead. Iconic.
Eugene’s mom saying he has a talent for eating lol 💀💀
Eugene's mom roasted the absolute hell outta him xD I can't breathe
I dare Jonny to say something bad about someone. He's so positive ❤
Oh my gosh, I want to see Marissa & Jonny baking cakes together!!
Eugene motivating Marissa is everything
Eugene: "I'm gonna tell my mom you gave me that rating " 30 seconds into the conversation - "I immediately regret my decision" 😂😂
yesss Marissa killed it!!!!
I like how helpful Eugene was being with Marissa and calming her down
Keith deserved way more wow reactions for that cake. He really did.
I love Marissa
I can't lie Marissa  is so hot in what she's wearing 🫠🫠🥵🥵
this was such a great episode!! so much creativity displayed and SO many great moments!! eugene's mom took me out LOL congrats to marissa for winning!!!!!
I love this episode
I just realized, Marissa has always beaten Zac, one place above him every time iirc...   Great season guys!!!
I love how when one if them decides to do something the actual cook tells to do the complete opposite
Eugene is this episode warmed my heart & I am HERE for it. From the plan B with Marissa, to the potential injury with the broken bowl, all of the love and support given... UGH <3 Love Johnny being the guys' cheerleader at the judging table and pointing out the things that were done well. His excited smiles were so sweet ^-^
Love how Eugene explained his mom's weddings quoting SIX The Musical and then accidentally beheaded the groom figurine.
eugene’s hanbok is so beautiful! warms my korean heart to see it 🫶🏻🫶🏻
Zach can be so underhanded with his comments 😂. “I have been told it’s safe to eat”, just coming on the helm of Eugene’s hydrangea oopsie. He really does toss his competition under the bus with comments he makes in a purposefully by-the-way manner. Just like the sandwich episode where he reinforced that Eugene’s sandwich wasn’t a traditional “sandwich”, just as the judges were debating letting it slide. I see your tactics Zach 😂.
Is the first time a guest won?
Rosanna’s delayed reaction to the divorce cake at 45:40 has me rolling 😭
i appreciate that when zack made the pillow princess joke, eugene looked embarrassed in gay 🤣
Breaks my heart that Marissa is divorced, sadness.
Butter makes the batter better honey
Dude Eugene is such a supportive friend
The idea of a couple who loves floors made me kaugh until I cried
I guess I identify as over 50 cause … I eat them lol. But I just like cake so 😅 you’ll see me with a slice and on the dance floor. Multitasking
Eugene supporting Marissa while she struggles is so sweet 🥹
Keith saying "you're cancelled" to the judges while in a wedding dress is the best moment of the season hands down.
Nicole is the FIRST Black woman on this show, whether it be Judge or contestant she is the first! Finally, it took 30+ episodes to get here.
I want Zach’s shirt🤣🤣
I really really really like this format. But please for the love of god cut down on the backround music. There is NEVER a break and it changes every two minutes. Id love to focus more on what everyone says and does rather than beeing drawn away by the music. Lots of love. E.💖
Nit eugene getting roasted by his mom😂
Oh my god I actually teared up at how proud Jonny was of Zach and Marissa he was so sweet
I`m under 50 and I LIVE for wedding cakes!!
I am LIVING for Johnny's facial expressions!!!
Zach wearing a Stanley tucci t-shirt in the pre-thoughts is so funny to me. It reminds me of the Korean skincare video
Where can i find Johnny's recipe of the cake he made in this episode?
Marissa could have lost some digits trying to stop that broken bowl 😭😭
Honestly, I have loved the last year of videos more than ever. Especially WAR. Love seeing all of the different faces and friends.
Eugene really mentioned SIX, and then beheaded the wedding topper to finish the analogy huh😂
All parts of the Hydrangea are poisonous.  Burning the leaves has also proven in some cases to produce toxic gases that can cause hallucinations. The Plant contains Toxic Sap, there's more Poison in the Leaves, and the Flowers aren't safe either. A fun fact about the Flowers, is that they'll bloom in different colours depending on the PH levels and Minerals in the Soil. If you change the Soil, they'll most likely be a different colour next time they bloom.
So Eugene just poured all the cacao powder in his cake batter... This is going to be a good episode.
Jonny hyping Zach up is everything! Like the wholesome vibes from Eugene being the big brother to Marissa to Jonny being so frickin proud is EVERYTHING I WANNA SEE AND MORE
Zachary Jedidiah Kornfeld, I CHOKED on my bowl. CHOKED, SIR. You know when.
WHO NOTICED THE BUTTER MAKES THE BATTER BETTER SIGN RIGHT AFTER KEITH SAID IT!! lol 12:08 😂
Marissa's fit in the judging was phenomenal.  Then when she was responding to Jonny's kind compliments, she looked like a full on goddess.
The shaaaade "today we're all wife guys" 😂 shots fired. The scream I scrempt 🤣
Johnny looks SOOOO good in a suit
Eugene: more is more Eugene have you lerand NOTHING!!!
Congrats girl you definitely deserved that W! 👏 🎉🖤
I love how Marissa has been incorporating boricua flavors. I’m not even from PR but I love the flavors that she’s been choosing this season of WAR ❤
Marissa looks so FINE in this episode.❤
Keith did not deserve 4th place. And I'm sorry but does anyone else notice that she knows a hell of a lot more than  what's believed. Maybe just me but I just don't get a positive vibe. Will say though LOVED how Eugene was such a partner with her ❤
This episode is so good cry laughing before work, the amazement in Marissa's Judging and the playback to Keith's judging
Marissa, this is said with every ounce of respect for you as a person and as a performer, your boobs look amazing.
I love Jonny so much 😂🫶🏻
Why does Keith still get mad "as a bit" during judging??? Props to the editor for really exposing how much of a tantrum he threw over nothing but like DUDE... the cringe is too much.
Eugenes mum was the star of this episode!
BOYCOTT THE TRY GUYS until they end their pathetic, half-assed approach to Palestine and the genocide.
I love how Keith woke up and decided, "Yes, I'm going to wear a dress and look so pretty."
I think my fav quote from this episode is "STOP GET AWAY FROM ME" @ Zach when he was being helpful lmaoooo  okay update new fav is Eugene saying his mom likes sand 😭
Living for Jonny’s encouragement of marissa to start cake decorating & becoming better than he is 🫶🏼😭
Omg this episode has me hurting from laughing so much, and also crying! One of the best WAR episodes yet!  Congrats Marissa!!
Desiree being so supportive of Keith during the fit he threw "In that dress??" is priceless 😂  EDIT: Eugene's mom is a SAVAGE 💀💀💀
amazing !!!
i love eugene
jonny feeling guilty about his comments in past episodes and being extra sweet to the guys this season😭 love him and his excited lil faces !!
Eugene's mom roasting him was awesome! 😂  I loved this whole video - there's so much GOLD here!
I love how sweet it was seeing Johnny support Marissa like that and when Eugene helped omg the improvement is insane 😩💗
Keith, it is already a thing!  Betty Botter bought some butter But she said the butter’s bitter, “If I put it in my batter It will make my batter bitter, But a bit of better butter Will make my batter better.”
marissa is always such a gem, i love when she's in videos. really proud of how well she did :)
Eugene tried to poison them and STILL didn’t get last 😂
im just like Eugene when someone thanks me in front of others i get so shy LOL
There's something so iconic about Keith in a wedding dress and losing his mind with 4th place
thumbnail maker yk what you've done
Damn... Goth Marisa is a freakin' VIBE. Total smokeshow!
Jonny coming in with inappropriate oversharing is honestly me and I'm here for it
Okay damn, i didnt come here expecting to cry like 3 separate times 😂😭  Congrats to the winner 🥺 Proud of you <3
WEPA, MARISSA 🎊 🎉
25:47 Words you never want to hear in any situation!!!!
OMG that opening statement was just **Chefs Kiss**
"love dosen't always win and go forward, tits out!!!"
Eugene's little smile when he realises him and Marissa are team divorce is everything
Like if you've finally had enough of the Try Guy's apathy towards Palestine!  ⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇
i think i unfortunately laughed harder at this episode than i have in a long time
Marissa looks amazing in that dress
Divorces are the  New Weddings.
0:25 He DID NOT lmfao 💀💀
MARISSA IS GORGEOUS 😍😍😍
Can we talk about how hot Marissa looks.  😍  She's beautiful. That final look. . . Incredible. 🔥
Immediately pausing the video to recover at 30 seconds after the BRUTAL “today we are all wife guys” 😂
❤❤❤❤
I will never watch another Try Guys video/content because of their *pathetically* quiet, hesitant, half-way stance about the Palestinian genocide. Deeply disappointed with this group who have been so vocal about social justice issues in the past.  Your weak Insta stories aren't cutting it, guys. Zach, Eugene, and Keith, you're on the wrong side of history. What is wrong with you all? FREE PALESTINE! 🔴🟢⚫
Eugene's mom is hilarious
Im SOSOSOSO happy for Marissa its not even funny. Shes wonderful and im sososo proud of her
I loved this episode.  Lol
eugene and marisa work together so well 🥲🥲 when he was helping her i teared up
ZACK  cake  is a Dalek   I can hear the cake say Dr.!!!!
Keith going bridezilla is amazing 😂
Eugenes Mom's comments were the best XD Also heck yes Marissa here for all the divorcees!!!
Okay Eugene: aka Drop Dead Fred ! Lol that looks like a mud pie 😅
I'm not a fan of chocolate cake so I would have loooooved to try Marissa's lemon cake
I KNEW marissas was gonna slap bc I use a VERY similar 1:1 lemon cake recipe that always turns out perfectly. I was punching the air she did everything so right I’m so proud of her
You don't want to add to much Cocao powder, meanwhile Eugene
I've only eaten one wedding cake and it was my friend's wedding and her sister said, "eat this cake I spent alot of money on this." It was a really good cake. Really fucking good. But my sister made cupcakes for everyone to eat so they could have the cake lol
i am vibing so hard w eugene and marissa’s energy LOL
There was so much to appreciate this episode. 1. Zach's outfits! From the Tucci shirt to the lavender suit. He looked amazing! 2. Zach actually applying things he learned from Johnny. 3. Marissa and Eugene being the anti-wedding duo. 4. Marissa's presenting outfit. I don't know who I was more distracted by. Zach or Marissa. 4. Johnny hyping Marissa up sooo much. Love it! This was a fantastic season finale of WAR!!!
sitting on my bed, giggling, kicking my feet at finding out marissa is single.
Eugene's mom was the best part lol
do you think the producers/behind the scenes ever wanna rip their hair out when the try guys are doing astronomically bad? 😭
I feel at home whenever Keith loses his shit 😭💗😂
Keith cancelling the judges while wearing that dress is iconic
Haha I loved the part about no one eating cake at weddings. We were eloped and had a party months later. No one ate the Publix cake hahaha.
Sounds like the cake is as dry as Keiths jokes are
The way I just yelled ZACHARY
I kinda wish Eugene called his sisters in the other episodes to get there reactions now lol 😂 I’m so happy Marissa won
I can’t watch the live episode of WAR because it’s on too late here but I want to just say what a joy it has been watching the other episodes this season. You can truly see how much fun everyone is having even when they’re struggling 😂 thanks to the try guys, the guests and crew for working hard to put smiles on our faces 🥹
This episode has everything I love.  Jonny is my absolute favorite TryFam person.  Ro is a queen and an absolute WAR staple.  Unexpectedly sweet Eugene is a mood.  A Keith freakout is iconic.  Nicole being an honest judge while still being nice and supportive.  Zach showing so much improvement, and he just gets funnier.  And Marissa is fast becoming a Jonny-tier guest, and just being so fierce and awesome.  I loved this.
Eugene referring to his mom as almost Six the Musical and then accidentally beheadding the cake topper is absolutely hilarious
When Johnny said "you should mix your batter by hand" I don't think he meant whatever Keith is doing 😂
You guys did amazing!  Doing a wedding cake is a monumental task….if Keiths is inspired by old fashioned wood floors, could you call is “par-cake”? ❤
Ohhhhh remeber the funfetti cake somebody did some years ago. MY WIFE lol then again the funfetti was for the first born.
I'm not even half through watching, but shoutout to the editor 12:07 who put "Butter makes the batter better honey" in the kitchen sign behind Jonny! Edit: Is Eugene wearing a traditional Korean wedding outfit? It was cool he wore it!
this was such a lovely episode!! i really enjoy jonny's judging, he's so supportive
This episode is truly a new peak for the try guys. Wholesome, chaotic, maddeningly funny, i laughed, i cried, i melted, marissa breaking the bowl and becoming champion, eugene being incredibly soft and chaotic and calling his mom, zach making a miracle of a decent cale, keith with his stair cake and one of the good old fashioned (heh) breakdowns, this episode is one of the top tens TRULY.
Best cake for a wedding, Costco sheet cake
This was BY FAR the best episode of WAR, I was smiling the whoooole time!
The roll back has me cackling 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keith looks so good in that Wedding Dress!
Marissa….GIRL! 11/10 on the wardrobe choice. 👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻
Marisssa fit during the judging was EVERYTHING. She served more than just the birth of a divorcée
Jonny is like the most supportive person ever and we must protect him, barbie heads be damned! 😂
whyy did no one eat the cake after maggie bit it tho lol, 96% of it are still fine? or was that a joke lol
"I'm painting whiskey in it" Keith. That's Jack Daniels. That ain't whiskey 😂 x
Lmao I AM johnny cakes talking about barbie head fets while in a tux tasting cakes hahah
"Today, we're all white guys. We're making wedding cakes." Not even a minute in the video and I hear this. Zach says some weird stuff
The real hero of this episode was Eugenes mom! Love that woman!
"Love doesn't always win, and go forth tits out" words to live by, truly
Whose gunna tell them Holographic glitter can not possibly EVER be edible. In order to get that effect it requires inedible ingredients. Big one being plastic.   Most “edible” glitter that’s holographic is “safe” in tiny tiny amounts. It’s about as safe as eating a tiny piece of a grocery bag. Technically yeah your fine but not recommended?
major shout out to the concept designer, the artist's renditions are normally 89x better than what the judges get
Keith’s reaction about killed me 🤣🤣🤣
The "in that dress?!" got me screaming 😂😂
Omg! Zach’s opening line had me SCREAMING
LOVE DOESN'T ALWAYS WIN, AND GO FORTH, TITS OUT!!!! Woooohoooo way to go Marissa!!!!!
why was this the sweetest judging ever😭😭😭im so proud of marissa!!!!!!!!
I WAS REWATCHING TRY VIDEOS AND THIS CAME ON AND I WAS SO CONFUSED BC I DIDNT REMEMBER THIS ONE. I LOOK AND IM HERE AN HOUR AFTER UPLOAD
Just here to say Marissa made a magnificent cake, and looked like a SNACK in that judging outfit. 🥵 🥵 🥵 🥵
Keith pouring his cake mix out of a literal VAT is the chaos everyone needed
On the verge of tears watching Eugene talk Marissa through an alternative. That was just the cutest and strongest "girl calm down, you got this" moments I've seen in this series in a while 😭😭
Keith looks killer in that dress 🔥
50:25 Is Eugene quoting Jimbo the Drag Clown?
"Kieth and zachs parents are unfortunately still together" im crying lol
MARISSA FINALLY WON AND THIS WAS PERSONAL TO HER IM SOOOO HAPPY FOR HER!!!!
THE WIFE GUY LINE!!! LMAOOOOO
10/10 for Eugenes Mom
This episode had me on a emotional roller coaster. Johnny you are right before you the try guys add Marisa I thought she was on the food network. ZACH he came along way and improved this year congrats to him.
Eugene saving marissas filling was so wholesome
52:24 Ro looks terrified 😭
Today we're all Wife Guy! Lol
why was this so taylor swift coded
I HOPE MARISSA STAYS WITH US IN WITHOUT A RECIPE 2024!!!❤❤❤❤❤
The shade at the beginning lmao
Divorced babes rise up! 🥰 Lmao - with "t!ts out!" <3
Keith is actually so correct. Most of Eugene's cake was poison
3 tiers!?!?! They're really going all out!!!
Marissa popped off today AND looked good doing it🤩what an icon
Bring Marissa back for more competitions! Love her energy and how it bounces off the guys
i am so proud of zach! 💗😭 we’ve watched how much he REALLY improved his skills.
I when eugene turned Gordon Rasay to marissa  😅 savage hahaha
i haven't finished the video yet but can i just say that i absolutely love the way jonny delivers his critiques?? he's nice and supportive but funny all at once. like the comments on zach's growth for example made me so happy  edit: okay finished the video and ahhhhh yasssss this is wild. eugene not only placing 3rd but below zach?? my boy zach is thriving! but also a guest winning the episode?? i'm impressed, fully deserved!!
Eugene supporting Marissa almost had me in tears. The way he was totally supportive AND constructive... I know Eugene hates lobbydubby sentiments so I'm just gonna say he's absolutely a truly decent human being. So good to see.
"Bake like you're in the shower!" (or like no one is watching, lol 😉)
"IN THAT DRESS?" Desirée is my spirit animal 😂
My jaw DROPPED at “today we’re ALL wife guys!” 🤣😅
Eugene’s mom 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 too real
OMG , marrisa has the best character arc!!!
Eugene and his mom are the best ❤
The “we’re all wife guys” 😂😂😂
Oh my god... they've done it... it took six years but all of them have managed to produce edible, slightly below average cake! I'm so proud <3
It's really very simple — ZIONISM = TERR0RISM. The world sees you siding with the oppressor. And we will *never* forget. *FREE PALESTINE!!!!!!!!!!* 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
"Love doesnt always win, and go forth, tits out"   This needs to be on a shirt 😂
Man Keith needs to tone down the white male rage shtick
Eugene giving Marissa a pep talk is the kind of competition that I love
Just the perfect representation of an asian mom. My heart 😂 I’m actually in tears laughing haha
Ugh, Marissa's bit got really annoying. We get it. You got divorced. You couldn't fullfil a promise you made, nothing to be so smug about 🙄
Zach whispering to Marissa "you're not invited back next year" is really funny 😂😂😂😂😂
8:17 just blew my fricken mind! It panned out to Eugene and his mini me! 🤣😭 I fucking love Marissa, so no disrespect! I just had surgery and I'm well medicated 🤣 The matching outfits and similar hair shapes just really boggled my brain! 🤦🏼‍♀️🤣
"Im wearing a tux, it wasnt the vibe, i should have just shut the fuck up" HAS ME HOWLING LMAOOOO hes so me
I honestly did not think that Keith could top his meltdown from the first cake without a recipe episode. But when he left the room to tell the office he lost, and then he banned the judges from the next season, AND told Rosanna that she was cancelled like the pettiest bitch on the planet, I was nearly on the floor wheezing with laughter.
Why did i almost cry watching Marissa win???!!!???!!
It's really very simple — ZIONISM = TERR0RISM. The world sees you siding with the oppressor. And we will *never* forget. *FREE PALESTINE!!!!!!!!!!* 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
It's really very simple — ZIONISM = TERR0RISM. The world sees you siding with the oppressor. And we will *never* forget. *FREE PALESTINE!!!!!!!!!!* 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Marissa talking to herself about how slow she is when it was the gelatin not setting and not her fault whatsoever was relatable
It's really very simple — ZIONISM = TERR0RISM. The world sees you siding with the oppressor. And we will *never* forget. *FREE PALESTINE!!!!!!!!!!* 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
I got an add for food waste before this and now I feel bittersweet
It's really very simple — ZIONISM = TERR0RISM. The world sees you siding with the oppressor. And we will *never* forget. *FREE PALESTINE!!!!!!!!!!* 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Great episode as always! the dichotomy that Eugene presents is always interesting to me because I have started to realise most of us are like that, he is in a beautiful long relationship but at the same time he is anti marriage etc, not that both are mutually exclusive.
Justice for Kieth Marrisa dq not a wedding cake
Didn't expect this video to be around an hour ngl.
Watching this at 1am in the morning made me so awake that I can't go back to sleep anymore.. I laughed out loud at how Min was so blunt to Eugene..
“Love doesn’t always win. And go forth, tits out.” Words to live by
This genuinely made me laugh so hard- I love Marissa so much lol
Marissa looks so HOT at the judging. SLAY GIRL
🤣🤣🤣 Love Eugene mentioning his stepdad died with an attitude that felt like it should have had a *womp wommp* sound effect behind it. 💝💝💝 (Don't worry, that's how i tell people my dad died too. Y'know, cuz OTHER PEOPLE are WEIRD about it).
Im sorry but Johnnys lore drop at 49:04 was truely so unexpected and unhinged I had to replay that to make sure I heard that right. Everyone being left speechless is how I feel after hearing that lmao.
Loved this 🎉
It's really very simple — ZIONISM = TERR0RISM. The world sees you siding with the oppressor. And we will *never* forget. *FREE PALESTINE!!!!!!!!!!* 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
I always learn something new from Johnny 😂
So happy Marissa won 🎉💔🎉
Well done for adding that sign at the back of Johnny lol
"today we're all wife guys" is such a strong opener xD
I love these more than anything
Just once, I wish they would actually TRY.
What a weird meltdown over how dry the cake was. Par for the course for Keith, who continues to embarrass himself like this and make a mockery of himself for his son to cringe at when he grows up... great job man yikes
Can we verify with Matt if Eugene is indeed talented with eating as his Mom said??? 😅😅😅😅😅
“I’m dry, he’s dense… “😂😂😂😂😂
not me crying at marrissa getting first place proud of you
Poor Keith, his cake looked so nice
I'm just glad to see another Keith meltdown 🤣🤣🤣
today we’re all wife guys…
Eugene's mom throwing the most innocent shade of the video lmao
I will go forth with tits out from now on
And here is Eugene to save Marissas day. He is such a sweet friend to talk some sense into her and calm her down
Marrisa's cake and Zach's cake sounds delicious to try..
Keith is such a gorgeous bride ❤🎉😂
Jonny over here talking about Vore.
I love how Eugene served a *potentially* 2/3rds poisonous cake. It was beautiful and a little deadly
Marissa looked so HOT at the end girl you should wear that look more often!!
Spoiler alert              the divorce cake winning the wedding cake competition is so funny
How to marry Eugene tho he's not straight 😭
gotta be my favourite war episode so far, the wholesomeness overall and zach and marisaa being the underdogs then getting top two is just great. also eugene's mum is hilarious
"Can I BE any slower?" My mind went directly to Chandler, a second later Eugene asks if that's a Chandler quote. That's how big his mark was. RIP Mr. Perry
Marissa. The outfit is BANGGGINGGG
Keith went full bridezilla mode
i absolutely loved johnny as a judge
I'd love to see the Try Guys make fried rice without a recipe with Eugene and @uncleroger as the judges 😂
We had brownies and cookies at our wedding. We aren’t cake people and we wanted to enjoy our dessert. We got so many compliments and we LOVED it!
but are we going to see mentor johnny for our marissa?! SO PROUD OF HOW FAR SHES COME !!!! 🫶🏼🩷✨🫶🏼
Eugene makes.... a poisonous cake.
that poor champagne!
LOL Zach I hope the wife guy joke watch cathartic!!!❤
Way to go Marissa. Congratulations!
"Flower juice is the LEAST of your problems!" 😂😂😂😂
Eugenes mom with the roast. Poor Eugene
Nice wife guy crack, Zach! I had to rewatch it just because it was funny!
“Today we’re all wife guys” ZACH 😭😭😭
Anyone else notice the Sorted "Pass it on" music when Zach's cake was shown?
On a Wednesday? We are truly blessed.
“I’m sorry to say but you don’t have much talent for cooking” has ended me
Ro, in multiple previous episodes: I’m very serious on the technicalities, you can’t win based on the technicalities   Marissa: wins even tho it was not a wedding cake.    What happened??
Eugene’s response to a panic Marisa is just 👏👏👏 I hope anyone going through chaos can have that l “marisa look at me …. *enumarates alternative options* ”
TODAY, WE'RE ALL WIFE GUYS  😆 i'm glad they can laugh about it a lot
eugene must be on america's good list, he's got so much crude oil in that mixer💀💀💀
New reaction for me: I literally yelped when Zach said "today, we're ALL wife guys."
Jonny never fails to make me laugh so hard 😂😂 he’s so out of pocket and it matches the energy so well
Jonny oversharing is hilarious. He would probably reveal a lot if he was a regular on the TryPod 🤣🤣🤣
12:05 I love the editors
noooo. not finale.
Eugene's gentleness ✨shining✨
Today we're all WIFE guys 😂💀💀
Jonny is such a handsome groom!!!
I want to be Johnny's friend so bad, he's so fuckin funny. "Y'all are wild" *sir you made Rosanna into a cakebarbie!!* 🤣🤣
Jonny being the best dad to all his lil baking babies
Im literally Eugene.. anti wedding and all 😅
Keith Hulked out into a terrifying Bridezilla 😂
I’m a straight woman but can we just say Marissa is 🔥🔥🔥 her proportions are to die for
The shaaaade 😂❤ love it
Am. I the only one who watched the food network show? Lol I loved Keith’s barn wedding cake lol
“You’re cancelled. I’m sorry.”
Not me screaming “*GASP* ZACCHH NOOOO” at the intro
Keith: full on BRIDEZILLA
This episode was so great! Marissa did amazing and Johnny loving the chaos from Keith and Eugene getting 4th and 3rd and their reactions, priceless 😂
Eugene’s awareness of how the time limit can mess you up and telling Marissa she needs a Plan B felt very “Veteran” Tri-Guy, love it
Keith somehow got fourth place while Eugene's cake was 2/3rds poison. XD
I know they joke about their show’s views but it was the only reason I got Discovery+ & I forced my family to watch every single episode. This show is much better though
Oooof I feel the sting that Eugene felt. I'm not sure if she was trying to fat shame him or just to compliment him on how he was a good eater of her cooking? I know a lot of mom's like it when their kids enjoy their cooking. While she said cooking wasn't your talent, you're still learning and honestly, Eugene, you're so talented in many other areas. No-one is amazing at everything. Besides, this show wouldn't be as entertaining if everything was perfect. You put a lot of heart and energy into your amazing creations and we appreciate you so much!
watching Keith and Eugene both add FAR too much baking soda/powder... did they learn NOTHING from Zach's boo-kake???
I would have watched the previous cake episodes before doing this; is that cheating?
I love that the guest wedding cake designer clearly has never watched without a recipe before 😂
KEITH GOES FULL BRIDEZILLA
loved the 'wife guy' joke. 10/10 please do more, my pettiness lives for it
“Today I’m making stairs” editors commenting “no really, stairs” I WAS DYING 😂
Where keith get that tsa airport bin? 😂😂
"Oh, I guess he'll just be headless..." laughed out loud for that one...
Me 30 seconds in: 👀😆😂😂😂😂 OMG ZACK 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the restart was definitely adding drama
OMG JONNY AND EUGENE SUPPORTING MARISSA FOLLOWED BY ZACH TELLING HER SHE'S NOT INVITED BACK WAS ICONIC
what a beautiful moment between marissa and jonny at the end. I hope they get together and bake sometime :)
😂😂My mom got through her divorce with a…friend
“Go forth, tits out” what a good day
omg Jonny's comments to Marissa at the end <3
"All those other cakes looked like wedding cakes. Mine? ✨️Stairs✨️"
I love how Eugene comforted Marissa🥹
Im sorry but since when is PINE a flavor??
the divorce cake is hands down, my favorite without a recipe concept of all time
This is the best finale... Almost a murder by poison, blood almost spilled, a gaslighting Keith, and a woman being told she should be in the kitchen.
Try Guys, with a Recipe Book when?? with ALL the stuff you've guys have made, just made... better so we can remake at home! <3
Eugene never having attended a gay wedding caught me off guard but then Jonny immediately following with "it's so annoying" just took me the rest of the way out 😂
Eugene calming marissa down and redirecting is so sweet and such a good friend moment. 💜
As a child of divorce, I feel very validated.
Marissa looks so much like Lady Gaga, I love it.
the guys have actually learned so much over the years it's insane
I love Eugene’s “six” reference but unintentionally incorporated “beheaded” to follow the “divorced, beheaded, died” line
OMG Eugene's mom came for his SOUL LMFAO
Eugene's mom casually roasting him. Iconic 😂
I love Eugene helping Marissa whenever she was clearly panicking. It was really sweet of him
Rosanna was right, this episode was so special and magical. It definitely had a wholesome feel about all of it, especially when Eugenes mom read him like a book lololol ❤
"I'm so glad it's over... much like my marriage"  made me choke all over again (after all of the zingers in this video, starting with the shade from Zach at the very beginning)! 💀
Marissa, we want your Divorce to PREVAIL too!!💯🤭🥰
Marissa is cute
Keith yelling at the top of his lungs while wearing a wedding dress made my year
Jonny is so kind and thoughtful in his responses. I just adore him.
" Thank you Johnny" 🥹🥺
Marissa looks soooo much like Aubrey Plaza in this episode!
Keith actually looks so good in that dress.😳
The math joke now the wife guy joke lol LOVE IT! Humor is healing 🫶🏼😂
They did not… in the first 35 seconds… 🤣🤣🤣
29:24 I think he meant “MOMstrosity” 😆 I’ll see myself out thank you 😅
Keith in that dress just did me in lol
"show that no one watched," when was this??????
eugene was amazing and caring this whole episode🥹
44:30 Not him making the champagne glass fall and noone saying anything
I love that Zach looked to Kieth as the pun king 😂
There's definitely a market for divorce cakes.
Marissa crushed it. From hair, face, outfit, vibes, to cake. Absolutely conquered. ❤
This video made made my morning!!
Keith, my good dude, that's cypress. Not pine.
Okay, Marissa is absolutely slaying that black dress
I am so happy Marissa wins!!! Her cake looks super cool!
Marissa with the divorce punsss
Go forth, tits out 🤌
Yay Marissa! Breakout star of the season🧨🎉 Another amazing episode, such heart, laughter, and sarcasm. I loved every second! My grandma was a professional baker, so I'm so impressed that y'all made cakes that had good flavor without a recipe.
I love Johnny representing my otter fantasies every video ... 🦦
Now I want cakeeeeeeee
It's 3am, but I will stay up and watch this.
“Love dosent always win and go forth, tits out.” - Marissa  Iconic. I’m feeling this so hard right now haha
I love these without a recipe episodes. I could watch them all year long! You should make tamales next!
Eugene's Mom is hilarious. Star of today's episode? Eugene's Mom. <3
This is truly one of the best episodes of WAR ever. Wholesome, everyone improved and supported and helped eachother and incredibly funny from the get go. Congratulations to everyone involved ❤
marissa in that dress.. I'm sorry but my lesbian eyes are straying 👀🌈
Marissa’s flavor choices this season have been top tier and elegant! 🩷
Love this episode so much. Soo much dress up and extravagant cakes. And MARISSA THE DIVORCEE WON!! 🖤
What show was Eugene on?  Ove seen the show Jonny was on, was it the same show just a different season?
44:34 nice cut away from the champagne spilling lol
My pick for first place got first and my pick for fourth got fourth, I'm so happy
"In that dress!?" Desiree is the real winner of this episode 😂
Eugene getting called out by his mom😂😂
Another Keith cake breakdown lmao Keith in WAR Cakes: THIS IS THE STUPIDEST SHOW! I HATE THIS SHOW!🤬 Keith in WAR Ice Cream Cake: YOU WILL NEVER MEET MY DAD 🤬 Keith in WAR Wedding Cakes: THESE JUDGES ARE NEVER INVITED BACK! UR CANCELLED 😡 I just realise the judges are the same as the cake ep but Nicole replaced Roy Choi
Marissa in her revenge dress, making the best comeback with a delicious cake is just incredible. Truly the most deserved winner.
I thought of WOAR last night while making an decorating a two tier birthday cake from box mixes :)
Hahaha so Eugene’s mom basically said “He ate.” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The whole room collapsing when he said "today we are all wife guys" made my day just a little bit
Eugene's mom OMG😂😂😂
If it came down to decoration, Eugene's was the best! It definitely looked done by an amateur, but it was the prettiest
Zack last second turning around and group brainstorming a name for his cake is very on brand
stop Eugene being so supportive and helping Marissa was so cute
haven't watched the end yet but I like to think most of the food is disgusting bcus the amount of baking soda they us e every time. Every recipe ever requires like the smallest tablespoons. With love
Really enjoy seeing Marissa in these episodes.
Johnny makes me so happy and I’m so happy he’s here!!!! ❤
I want to see a competition where they bring in Rosanna, Jonny, and Josh or any of the other super talented bakers that come on the show to compete and have them bake some sort of extravagant dessert and the try guys have to judge it.
Anyone else went back to see if that sign was behind Johnny before. Good job editing team😂😂😅
Damn Rosanna looks SO GOOD in the wedding dress! Almost comming close to Keith :D hahaha
I cannot thank you guys enough for an amazing season of Without A Recipe. It truly is my comfort show, every episode has made me smile and laugh. Thank you to Zach, Keith, Eugene, Kwesi, Jared, Marissa + Rosanna and Jonny, and all the other judges. Also big thanks to rachel and the behind the scenes crew!!! All your hard work is appreciated. Hopefully looking forward to more WAR content + all the other new tryguys content we'll get in 2024!!
Eugene immediately and calmly triaging in crisis “hands up, put your hands up, there is glass!” Was exactly the wholesome endearing content I needed on my lunch hour, thanks y’all.
TODAY WE’RE ALL WIFE GUYS hahahahaha holy shit 😂
Marissa is a really refreshing person to have in these videos, the new comer that doesn't quite know what's what with recipes and doesn't have an all consuming personality, she makes me feel like she's a self insert of the viewer
I LOVE MARISSA
Keith and his GIANT Tub, OMG!🤣🤣🤣❤️
“I did make a good cake on that show that noone watched” -lookin directly at us lol
i was fully expecting Zach to say "Its gonna be shimmery, its gonna be shiny, its gonna be splendid." but I can still say that I was not disappointed with anything in this video. Keep up the Good Work guys.
Imagine keith planning a wedding by himself. He's dressed as a bell and says ding dong I do then cuts his stairs themed wedding cake.
I could see a wedding cake that looks like those fancy ballroom stairs. It would have to be done by someone with a LOT  of experience, but I could totally see it. Imagine having the couple coming down one on each side, I think it'd be cute!
Eugene helping Marissa gives me life! 🥰 He's so incredibly supportive! I love that!!!
THE WAY THAT KEITH'S FLOWER WAS LIKE SLIGHTLY RIPPED APART DURING MARISSA'S JUDGING BECAUSE EUGENE BIT INTO IT
Keith looks hot in that wedding dress, that waist snatched, the shoulders giving, love it
is this the episode for the divorced parents kids
"today we're all wife guys" the way i started scream laughing
This is the first time in my life a youtube video makes me smile so much my face hurts, congrats to everyone, you're hilarious
everything about this episode was SO GOOD!
Its so rare to see Keith not like a bit but i love how much he wanted to move on from the barbie head vore kink conversation lmao
How is it live if there are already previews??🤨
I knew I vibed with zach for a reason. I too am a disabled size queen pillow princess 😂😂😂😂.  (Also worth noting that the more pain youre in the more pillow princess is your only reliable option)
this episode is basically just "ive learned from oast episodes so im going to make a masterpiece "
Eugene helping Marissa is so sweet!
"today we're all wife guys" 😂 omg Zach's unending petty remarks towards He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is HILARIOUS
Keith saying "butter makes the batter better honey" and then immediately it cuts to a clip of Jonny with that quote edited onto his wall 😂😂 i really appriciate those little editing bits
Marissa is my favourite WAR guest
Eugene accidentally adding poison flowers....you can take the eugene out of evil but you can't take the evil out of eugene
Divorce cake 😂 the best
I love sweet Eugene. I know he's probably nauseated that I said that, lol. But omg, I'm so soft for sweet Eugene 🥹
Desiree yelling "IN THAT DRESS?!“ 😂😂
Top notch WAR episode lol
Jonny is like a proud cake daddy in this episode, its so wholesome ❤
I'm so happy for Marissa ❤❤❤ all season she's been great. I also think with her vision and flavor combination, she would excellerate so fast if she followed a recipe 😅🎉. I laughed so hard this episode!
Marissa was awesome this episode! Impressive.
I want to suggest to Rachel- the guys with a recipe vs a professional without a recipe
I think this has been one of my favorite episodes of WAR. ❤  Eugene and Marissa should get a domestic partnership! They’re so sweet to each other!
Eugene's mom and Marissa are the damn MVP of this episode. lol
eugene calling his mom was my favorite part.
12:12 OMG THEY MADE IT A SIGN BUTTER DOES MAKE THE BATTER BETTER HONEY
As Eugene said, *MARISSA IS DIRVORCED?!* 😱 I didn't even know that she was married to begin with, she looks like a kid, so I kept thinking that she's not even old enough to get married legally!🤣🤣🤣 Marissa looks so much like an adorable little girl, that she _resurrected_ Eugene's big brother instincts!😂😅
Apart from the out-of-pocket comments from our dear disaster gay baker, this episode was one of the sweetest episodes ever(pun intended).  I kid you not, i cried a little when Marissa said that she couldn't have made it without Eugene. A lot of things go well and for that we think they were easy, but the truth is that we wouldn't archive as much as we have without the people around us. Please bring Marissa back next season, i think she is such a wonderful addition to the show, a try gal at heart.
Eugene-  "i did make a good cake on that show that no one watched" WERE SORRY EUGENE THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON
THE JOHNNY LORE OMG
Ahhh probably my favorite episode of WAR yet!! Everyone did so well!
I adore how the guys have become almost like mentors to the guest bakers. So wholesome
I know using a glass bowl for a stand mixer is better for the camera... But what a horrible invention lol
Yes, Marissa! Also, Jonny encouraging her was so sweet, making me tear up over here!
please try baklava ❤
The butter/batter sign behind Jonny🤣
Marissa...i am looking RESPECTFULLY
I'm sorry but Maggie biting the cake made me laugh so hard cause I would do the same if I ever got married... *sniff*
Eugene's mom is a savage
Zach's Stanley Tucci shirt was the star of the show
As a woman not attracted to women (as in, not trying to objectify here)  Marissa is so cute lol. The tiddies be tiddy-ing (slayyy), the cute little hair knots and fab eyeliner was a vibe, she's so sweet even when she says harsh things somehow, and she's so funny. I guess this is just a Marissa appreciation post. You go, girl.   ALSO SHE DID SO GOOD
I’m dying at the fact that Keith got 4th when Eugene literally almost poisoned the judges
My friends know I'd prefer a birthday pie instead of a birthday cake so Keith having wedding pies makes me feel validated lmao 😂
Eugene being Marissa's Emotional Support Friend while she was freaking out over the passion fruit gel is just so very sweet. You really see her go from "oh no, I can't do this" to "oh, this could be ok" after Eugene help her refocus. One of the best moments in this series. ❤
Besides the snide and clever Wife Guys comment…. I love the friendship between Eugene and Marisa <3 He was truly helping her and just…aw…
I’ve been loving Johnny as a judge this season
Heh you know that if Rachel says "nooo" is going to get to the final video
Zach!!! 😂😂😂😂 I had to rewind a bit because i missed what he said at first but i had to go back because of the crews "NO" 😂😂😂
Eugene calling his mom was EVERYTHING 😂
This was amazing i loved it, Marissa did amazing that is a cake i would definitely buy and i hate cake ♥
The Dry Guys
It’s ironic that Eugene’s cake is poisoned lolol
Eugene’s mom roasting him on his cooking but still trying to compliment him that he likes to eat was so on brand for an Asian mom 😅😅
I love how the replay confirms it was in fact the dryest
Love doesn't always win and go forth tits out ✨💕
So happy for Marissa, congrats on the win!!
I really wanna see the guys try to make more ethnic food without a recipe, like imagine trying to make tres leches, pan de polvo, or flan without a recipe 😂😂
Now I want more videos of Marissa baking with Jonny!
Oh my gosh, Eugene! When I married my first husband, the wedding cake statue was broken during the reception and the groom's head was nowhere to be found. My mother swore it was an omen and the groom "will lose his head!" It turned out to be 100 percent true.
Also, can we appreciate Rachel making the sign behind Jonny after Zach said it should be hanging in a kitchen somewhere 🎉
Proud of Marissa coming from someone who seems to be like fish out of the water from the beginning of this season, her divorce cake looks phenomenal
I love Johnny so so so much, like I just love him
rosanne's adorable little happy dance when she ate something yummy 😭<3
Keith being bridezilla. 52:32
*Love doesn’t always win and go forth tits out* ♥️
that was good!
omg Eugene's mom is basically Tamiko Ridley from "Inside Job" -- She needs no man, she married herself lol
Times I wish there was a ❤ button on youtube.
Eugene looking out for Marissa when there was glass ❤
Love how anti-marriage Eugene says Keith and Zach’s parents are still together, not Keith and Zach are married 😂
I'm really glad the expert also said hydrangeas are poisonous 😂 as soon as I saw them I'm like "oh no you can't put those on there!!!" It doesn't matter what Eugene tries to do, he is always accidental evil Eugene.
I don’t think when Jonny said its better to mix by hand he pictured what Keith did
First time the judges all loved their outputs
as someone who loves the outdoors I low key want that stair cake at my wedding one day
Eugene is so sweet this season! Hugging Zach and Keith, giving them a kiss and encouraging Melissa!!
Hi Mrs.Cakes, or Jonny's mother.
I love the return of bridezilla keith lol Damn and Eugene's mom roasting him in the phone call was hilarious lol    Also love the funny quotes "you belong to the kitchen. Congratulations marissa" "love dosent always win, tits out"
Marissa looks HELLA GOOD!!!!
Johnny you said the inside thoughts out loud, babe. 😭
I'm so happy for Keith that he got to do a rant ❤ He's so good at it. 😁
I made a great cake on the she no one watched 😂😂😂😂 im dying 😂😂
Eugene's mom is such a gem. "I'm sorry to say this, but I don't think you have much talent for cooking. You know. That's funny, but anyhow you have a good talent for eating" TOOK ME OUT 😂 I love her
I cant believe they added too many eggs and over mixed AGAIN those were iconic mistakes how did they not remember
Man I cried laughing so many times this episode, one of my new favorites. Also Marissa's divorce cake winning the wedding cake challenge is so awesome lol
Johnny is heartwarming 🥹
That ending damn just damn
The head lying on the lower tier is killing me 😂
After Eugene talked about Six the musical, I don't believe that the beheading was an accident 😂
Marissa looking? 👀🫰
Johnny was spilling all the tea 😂
Last season: Are the guys making Johnny uncomfortable with this gimp cake and this bookakke and this foot cake? This season: *Johnny dropping the forbidden barbie swallowing knowledge*
a new try guys video is the best way to start your day!
Eugene's mom is amazing 😂 ❤️. I love everytime she is involved in the videos. She brings the humor without trying at all ❤️.
**floor**
So, Keith pulled a season 1 Eugene. You'd think he'd remember his first cake.
Keith distributing cake batter from his girano dish tub is such lunch lady energy lmfao
Marissa is no joke one of the most beautiful humans to ever exist
Love Eugene and Johnny’s gay convo lmao at 2:39
Marissa is giving that single lady who’s mission is to go home the best man or get some action in the bathroom and I am HERE for it. ❤
I THINK THIS IS MY FAVORITE EPISODE CAUSE OF JUST SUPPORTIVE AND SWEET IM CRYING
I have to wait until my lunch break to watch this! Boo, work priorities 😢
Keith moving everything to the tub and Zach repeatedly saying "what are you doing?" had me howling! 😂😂
I almost freaked out because I thought the wedding cake was the actual final where we can and that they changed it or something went wrong I have never been so thankful to be wrong in my whole life
Marissa has grown on me so much. At first I was like who’s this new person but now I can’t imagine it without her our Jared or anyone . Glad her and Eugene finally got paired together I was always wondering why they haven’t been together and this video the way Eugene looked in her eyes and told her it’s going to be okay but to have a plan B for filling. I love them together
Haha, who would've thought it would be Eugene that almost poisons someone?
Why wouldn’t they tell Eugene that it’s poison 💀 I know it’s without a recipe but damn
Marissa is bae. That is all.
You should create a new show where a professional remakes the winning dish with the help of the winner
omfg zach's cheeky smile when he says "today, we're all wife guys' hahahahahah love it so much
👏🏻👏🏻 Marissa yess!!
I've been wondering this for awhile, who is the narrator for WAR? I love them!
Marissa was such a great addition to this channel and I loved her in this episode ❤️.
13 minutes in and they've lost their minds. Fun!!
I'm just happy my favorite musical was mentioned 😂
Go forth tits out. 💜
I'm only five minutes in, so don't know how it will turn out, but I am really proud of Zach. A few years ago, he would have just decided to throw a bunch of sprinkles and breakfast cereal in the batter and call it a day. His disco ball theme sounds  ambitious.
Eugene supporting Marissa when her bowl broke was so kind and understanding, I think it healed something in me
Marissa stressed herself out so much 😭 im glad her cake turned out great
How was Kieth robbed again?!
Keith saying “butter makes the batter better honey” and then immediately cutting to the sign behind Jonny had me HOWLING 🤣🤣
11:57 omg just when keith says that "butter makes the batter better honey" would be something up in a mom's kitchen johnny's kitchen has it up LMAO
bc we’ve been hearing so much about eugene’s moms side of the family, the quote from his grandfather being that texan SENT me
I saw the hydrangeas i thought "oh no is Rachel not gonna stop him?? That's gonna kill someone!" 😮
This was the best episode of all of without a recipe in my opinion!!! Loved it
Ro looks so gorgeous 😭ETA: Johnny really needed to get that thing about his mom off his chest lmao
I would love to see Without a Recipe judges react to the episodes 😂 I think it would be so funny to see them react to the insanity that happens in the kitchen
johnny’s lack of filter continues to astound me😂
Eugene is so sweet and supportive 🥹
Marrissa GUUUURL you looked so fire in that outfit at judging god damn!!!!
23:23 eugene??? R u a chef in your past life?
WOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
i love eugene and marissa duo
35:44 why can I hear oh dear oh dear when hearing this song?
I can assure you I am NOT a wife guy.
i love johny he was so nice towards every try guys he was supportive and underrated FR love you johnyyyyy
Maggie bit it😂
SHADE 💀💀💀
poison cake
omg i just finished watching the last one and was trying to guess when this was going to be realesaed!
IM SORRY EUGENE HAS NEVER BEEN TO A GAY WEDDING?!?! CAN I INVITE HIM TO MINE IN THE FUTURE?!
Marissa is such a sweetheart, I love her so much ❤️
I can't believe Eugene made his cake poisonous lmao. Evil Eugene is back! By accident.
Zach being a size queen and a pillow princess fills my queer heart with joy
Totally didn’t know about the kink of swallowing Barbie heads
ZACH! You can't say that!  Say it more!
Every ADHD person needs a Eugene to look at them when everything is going wrong and say, “Make a plan B and keep moving.” Love that moment.
“Today we’re all wife guys” BRUHHH 💀😂
Jonny is SO FUNNY i was cackling
Just paused the video because I was laughing too hard when Zach said "Yeahh nobody ate the cake at my wedding... Maggie bit it" I am DYING that's amazing hahahaha I aspire to be Maggie at my wedding
loved seeing eugenebeing the keith of the group and supporting marissa through her panic
I think most people would expect Eugene to be the most shady one but no, it’s Zach.
Flower juice is the least of your worries - facts
Oh, I didn’t know another episode was airing before the live stream! This just made my day😭🙌💜
Being half-Korean, Eugene's cake reminds me of my mother. ♥♥ Zach's cake look's more like a divorce cake, "Party!" Keith has the best outside-the-box concepts. Marissa's newer but I love her chaotic energy!
Eugene baking was so chaotic.
WHY DOES EUGENE’S BATTER LOOK LIKE THAT??
Divorce cakes (and parties) should be a thing.
I love Johnny. Can we have Johnny all the episodes ever?
Eugene, youve done this before. Why the hell did you leabe your batter mixing for NINETEEN MINUTES!!!
Hey Johnny, you know what lasts longer than 40% of marriages? You informing us of Barbie head swallowing kinks on the internet. 🤭
ngl i relate so hard to johnny when he talked about the barbie head kink
Why does Zach's look like a Dalek 😂
Marissa looks so gorgeous with her hair slicked back🖤
Zach KILLED me with that line, i loved it and hated it at the same time
Eugene helping when the jelly wasn't setting was so wholesome.
Eugene is seeming like a much more fulfilled individual these days. I don't know what it is exactly but seeing him be huggy and supportive and complimentary and gushing over his family this season, it really fills me with joy I didn't know I needed! 🥹
The way Zach consulted with the others and came up with “Discake” hahahah
Eugene being the voice of reason and helping calm Marissa is awesome! I’m loving this new wholesome side of him!
I watched the food network show! I bought discovery plus just to watch it!
Here i was thinking: what happened with evil Eugene from earlier seasons and boom used poison flowers 😂😂🤘🏻🤘🏻
Zach making a 100% correct decision when EVEN KEITH didnt- that's the biggest sign of growth
I love Keith 😂
"Love doesn't always win and go forth, tits out" best quote in 2023
Zach adding the right amount of dry ingredients????? What world is this 😂
Marissa is the best thing to come out of the post N-day era ❤ I want her in more omg
I’d kill a man to be divorced from Marissa.
What was that weird cut when Eugene was listing the judges? "The head chef of Rosco's Chicken and Waffles..." and sounded like he was about to say the name but there was just an awkward cut. Then it was Nicole on the panel.
I cant tell you how much it warms my heart that Jonny and I didn't plan our outfits and yet every single person here looks like they belong at a very Try Guys wedding. What an absolutely amazing season. Hope to see you all on WAR Live! 👰
oh my god i was just doing a war marathon and this pops up
Why no caption? 🥺
"today we're all wife guys" IM SCREAMING
Omg im so glad marissa wooonnnnn
Anyone notice how the editing team added a "Butter makes the batter better honey" sign behind Johnny?
“Turns out, flavors doesn’t matter in these challenges” Zach is SALTY after that s’mores challenge 😂 but understandably why
Eugene adding all the cocoa powder scares me 😂
This video is already iconic!!!!!!!!!   Rosannna in a wedding dress!?  Eugene and Marissa being icons!??  "Today we are all wife guys"!??????!   Wow just wow
I really appreciate Eugene taking Marissa down and leading her down a different track of mind, because I know how easy it is to fall into a spiral when you only have one plan
"today we're all wife guys"   Lemme tell you, i GASPED😆 The healing is real. There are actually 7 stages of grief, the 7th is SHADE
Petition for more formal-dress episodes!!
Eugene is so lovely for helping his competitor
I love how supportive they are! When someone has a problem, we can always count on their WAR partner to help them out! Teamwork! Sportsmanship!
Eugene with that wholesome assistance
“Nothing more basic bitch than a heterosexual wedding.” same Zach same. 5:53
Eugene being Marissa's rock to calm down her anxious mind and giving her an alternative plan that could salvage her cake is so sweet
Eugene's mom  roasting him was highlight
This is awesome lol
Eugene accidentally putting poison in seventy percent of his cake is surprisingly on brand for him
not the butter makes the batter honey sign behind johnny after keith mentioned it😂
Absolutely love Eugene helping Marissa out and calming her down about the jam for a plan B🥹
My parents are also, unfortunately, still together. Damn them, being all in love and shit. Ridiculous. Who does that these days?
Omg!! I LOVE Eugene’s mom!!
i love kieth's dress !!
Ro's smile and laugh are just so bright
Eugene and Marissa are the dream anti-wedding duo
Cant wait for the live show!!
My mom would embarrass me like that too 😂
Eugene talking Marissa through the gelatin not working was so cute
i want, so desperately, for the guys to google the difference between baking powder and baking soda ;A; it hurts me
ZACHHH LMAO
Eugene helping Marissa when her jelly wasn't setting was so sweet, absolutely iconic!
I love how the editors put a sign behind Johnny Cakes “Butter makes the batter better”
9:20 yes we are zachy boy. 100% correct lets fucking gooo
Eugene giving a spark of Gordon Ramsey energy to Marissa is the confidence she needed
I LOVEEE MARISSA AND EUGENE CHEMISTRY PLSS
Eugene helping Marissa when she was really panicking ecen if it is a competition is the kind of frriendship that is golden
butter makes the batter better sounds like something a theater kid would repeat over and over to warm up before the big show.
"Today we are all wife guys" 😂😂😂 Said with absolutely no poker face, and this is why we all love Zaddy🎉🎉
Keith spatula-ing batter off his hands and back into his massive buss tub is so hilarious
Today I learned : there's a kink of swallowing barbie heads. People love to feel the barbie heads process thru the body. The more you learn from jonny cakes
That Wife Guys joke almost went over my head 😂😂😂 oh my god I almost spit my drink out at work! Oh the shade!
I love how the guys help Marissa around❤ Eugene advised her like a big brother, Zach fights with her like a younger brother and Keith annoys her and still agrees with her at times 😂 I just love this season of WAR the most ❤ First Jared and Kwesi now Marissa I love them all ❤ and the try guys are slaying it ❤ Zach actually being the sane one makes me go crazzzyyy ... love you guys ... excited for your 2024 ventures.. All the best and Love you guys ❤ Rachel love you... you are the Mother Hen of try guys and 2nd try ❤
I feel personally attacked by Eugene as a 34 year old lover of raspberry vanilla cake
Normally watch things in 1.5-2× playback speed, but I'm slowing this down so I can really savor it. So excite!
6:10 The way I literally said aloud “Goddammit Keith”
This is my favorite series of all time. I could watch this forever
Keith took “mix by hand” a little too literally 😂😂😂
EUGENE'S MOM ROASTIMG HIM OMG
0:28 DAAAAAAMN🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Spoiler for Eugene's cake:    With the poison flowers and headless man, this has unintentionally became a black widow/ preying mantis type of theme lol  Fitting to name it: "til death do us part"
"No, we don't know about the kink of swallowing Barbie heads" may be the best line out of context.
"kind of like six." Did.. did your mom behead him?
eugene helping out marissa and keeping her grounded is very sweet of him!
Eugene helping Marissa when she almost had a breakdown because of passion fruit gelly is why I love this show and this boys and everyone working there! It may be a competition, they may stress out and shout, but the most important thing is for them to have fun. If one of them doesn't, everyone else helps that person out! Love you all!
I love the pride in Keiths voice when he said his dress was off the rack. When youre bigger/taller its so hard to find dresses that fit and feel good
It’s finals week and this brought me so much mind numbing relief
Wish I could watch the livestream but I will not survive staying up till 2am in the UK 😭😭
Dont know what Eugene means, I love cakes at weddings, if I went to a wedding and there was no cake that would just ruin my night
I believe all the judges should have worn a wedding dress
Eugene being really sweet and supportive with Marissa, while being his chaotic self in a kitchen was amazing
I love how when Marissa is paired with Zach She is always messing with him, and with Eugene she’s helping him lol
I’m so in love with Marissa it’s not funny
What I would have given to see a Rachel Reaction came this episode 😂😂
Aw Eugene helping Marissa 🥹😭 it’s so much better when everyone has good sportsmanship.
Jonny calling gay weddings annoying is top tier gay culture honestly.
The character development of Zach being 100% right with the ingredients and process of the cake while the others didn't is a thing that wasn't on my bingo card this year, but I'm proud that it happened. Great job Zach!
Late to my year-end meeting with my boss to watch this video in its entirety. 🫡
Eugene's "I've done that before!" To Marissa is so sweet, like older brother reassuring the young sister on life's mistakes
The Single Funniest part of this video was an ad placed right after Jonny started to describe the kink of swallowing Barbie heads. He described the kink then before anyone reacted an ad for a local law firm (Call Sam) came on saying “have you been injured in an accident?”. I cannot stop laughing. It was timed perfectly!
12:07 the poster edited into Johnny’s kitchen is pure gold
This video was iconic from start to finish.
Who would think we'd all be super pumped for an hour long video, baking (chaos) wedding cakes, from the same Try Guys we knew and loved at Buzzfeed all those years ago?  It's great to see people actual doing something they enjoy for a living.  You guys are literally living the dream.  Try Guys for life💖
Marissa is so lucky she didn't get cut really badly! That freaked me out. *Wipes forehead.  Also, She owes Eugene at least two drinks for his help that day.
Eugene is literally me! "Oh Ive done that" 😂😂😂😂
Keith and Zach are like the chaotic cousins who wreck havoc at every family get together love that
Loved Eugene's way of calming and coaching Marissa ❤😊
I nearly cried when Eugene went into big brother mode. Sounded like when my brothers showed me support when I was cooking for big events.
I always knew one day that someone would serve literal poison to the judges. I just never expected it like this.
“love will not prevail. not here, not in this kitchen.”  that’s kinda true and ironic, isn’t it?😂
Marissa represent 🇵🇷!
OH MY GOD ZACH 🤣
Without a Recipe Roadtrip is streaming on MAX, totally just binged it this week
The fact they actually have the line "Butter makes the batter better honey" on the wall behind Jonny😂
the glass shattering & marissa trying to stop it with her hands broke me inside 😭 so glad she wasn’t hurt
that wife guy joke got me good
I'm convinced Eugene was trying to fail 😂
for marissa to mess up n zach be right was not something i was expecting
Keith seemed a bit off today is he ok?
Everyone dressed in wedding attire fir the judging is absolutely amazing! And Eugune accidentally using poison flowers was perfect lol
Okay Try guys! Y’all been coming out with the heat this season!!& ❤❤
did Zach and Keith Freaky-Friday???? cause why is Keith's batter chaotic and Zach's looks stunning??
“Cuz Keith and Zach’s family are… unfortunately still together..😅” HAHAHA
eugene going going into older brother / mentor mode with marissa this episode was so wholesome 🥰🥹🥹
love the butter makes the butter better sign behind Jonny
Zach is killing it. This is great 😂
Eugene suddenly becomes the sensible one as soon as Marissa needs help
The editor adding the "butter makes the batter better honey" sign on johnny's wall is amazing
I love how they help each other
Are we gonna talk about Zach’s shirt
I love how supportive but honest Eugene was towards Marissa. How he kept comforting her when she was panicking and giving her alternative ideas was so sweet.
to the editor that added in Keith's "Butter Makes the Batter Better Honey" sign into the background of Johnny Cakes demo, we applaud you.
1) I love the idea of a divorce cake 2) I understand that some people don't love cake, but also the cake at my wedding was so good that I sometimes think about just randomly sending the baker extra money because the *memory* is still so delicious 3) I love love love Maggie just taking a full bite of the cake, plunging in headfirst. An ICON
im so proud of Zach for being the first of the guys to ever get his dry ingredients right for a cake episode
This show has to be my favorite thing on the internet.
Eugene and Marissa being the anti-marriage tag team elevated this finale. 🤣
The best wedding I went to was a gay wedding. They flew in a famous Bollywood dance troupe, there were multiple costume changes for the grooms, and the DJs set list was fire. 10/10 experience
I’m terrified to watch this
IM SO EXCITED
My ex husband told me he didn’t want to be married to me anymore after six weeks! I told him well that was a waste of time and money wasn’t it? 😂
Marissa being divorced was not the plot twist I was expecting today
"Ive never been to a gay wedding" "ITS SO ANNOYING!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eugene yelling putting your hand up when Marisa mixing bowl broke was so sweet ❤
Time for the season of divorce
Eugene's station always looks like a murder scene
Best end of finals present!!!!! 🥰🥰
keith never wins with cake 😭😭😭
No way "today we're ALL wife guys" BWAHAHA
Shout out to bingeing  w.o.a.r when you’re home sick
Today we're all Wife Guys. Zach!
FINALLY!!!!!
Did anybody notice that at 12:09 you can see a “Butter makes the batter better honey” sign behind Johnny?
ZACHARY THAT WIFE GUY JOKE IS TOO GOOD
….Since when is pine a cake flavor, Keith?
Anyone else tripped up seeing how they’re actually getting good at doing these? 👀
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you to Zach for saying the joke I heard in my head, and also thank you to Rachel for responding in the same way I responded in my head
While the 3 guys hve so much experience doing this, it is better Marissa broke the glass then if Zach  did.
ZACH !!!!!!!!!!!!!
2 videos in one week/ is this on purpose? Yayy
I'm glad Zach didn't shove Maggie's face into the wedding cake. She shoved her own face.
@20:17 Relatively incorporated™
Marissa is just 3 just about my age  and she is already divorced  dang i think millennials would be that generation of Single, divorced and just fuck buddies
I am watching RIGHT NOW
Thank you for not letting the fear of failure stop you from doing so many amazing things Appreciate the love you spread
Me when Eugene is back: 🙂 Me when Jared, Kwesi, or Jimmy are back: LETS FUCKING GOOOO🎉🎉🎉
Can’t decide if I should marry Rosanna or Keith. They both look incredible in their dresses…
😂 Zach being less chaotic feels so weird to me. He's the most chill while baking 😂
LOVE YOU GUYS
OMG....divorce cake SHOULD be a thing!
36:21 50?! In my household maybe 5...
11:55 Keith talking about the the butter and batter makes me think of the saying my mom and dad occasionally say. “A little bit of butter makes a bit of batter better.”
wifeeeee
Is always the Baking soda/Baking powder dilemma 🤣
Eugene and Keith both look so pretty.
I want the try guys and the try wives to tag team in a without a recipe episode
I love how Eugene is wearing a 한복 저고리
Love when Jonny and Eugene has a gay sidebar
I know Eugene's cake is going to be absolutely insane as far as just the display levels. With that cake and I'm excited just see it
I wouldn't have expected Keith to be the rude guest who shows up in a white dress 😂
Cutting from Zach to the expert who verifies his educated decision is a new one.
I really appreciate that the MOMENT there was threat of injury Mom Rachel appears to save the day 🥹
30 seconds in and I’ve already gasped
The Without A Recipe finale expert being Johnny is amazing. Johnny is the Final Boss of this Season's WAR.
Zach saying one of the most iconic lines wearing a Stanley Tucci T-Shirt? Singularity has been achieved.
"Today, we're all wife guys" SHOOK ME TO MY CORE
I love Marissa with the guys
I know that they are supposed to make this entertaining. And it is! But I feel like Zach and Marissa are the only ones trying. Some things that Keith and Eugene do, are just so so obviously wrong. There's no way that they don't know that adding a shit ton of baking powder or eggs will not make it better.
i love how they removed the annoying guy
Yaass Marissa
It's Eugene's turn to make Mommy's Favorite (the honourable kind).
Eugene looks so beautiful ❤
Maggie biting the wedding cake is such a mood. Would I want my groom to shove cake in my face? Hell no, but shoving my own face in my expensive wedding cake? Hell yeah!
Sir it’s Wednesday
Ro survived another season
"Maybe I just panic for the first hour and do nothing" is sooo relatable 😅🫣
“Today we’re all wife guys…” “NO!” 😂😂😂
TEAM KEITHHHH
I would've watched that show nobody watched if I had access to it Eugene 😔
How was Eugene more chaotic than Zach? 😂
This is exactly what I needed today! Cake time!
Uhhh I’m early 😌
eugene and marissa being the anti-wedding force duo is so iconic✨
Keith and Zach’s parents are unfortunately still together. 😂  Thank you, Jonny, for bringing a little kink to this cake episode. 😁  Can’t wait to see everyone’s creations, especially Eugene’s!  Eugene’s mom is the GOAT
I appreciate the poor man's season final
Zach's Metallica reference haha that was the best🧩🎶👩‍👧‍👦😜🤣😂
Too bad the real wife guy isn't here. I miss Ginger Squidward. Btw Keith looks gross in a dress I also with Marissa going tits out. So beautiful
This series has gone from trying to bake bread and cookies to baking entire wedding cakes and getting them judged while dressed in bridal gear. I dont know how they could possibly top this next year. And here I thought they had hit peak WAR with the bookake episode.
ZACH SHOTS FIRED IMMEDIATELY
Eugene and Marissa supporting each other is the most wholesome thing, truly
They shouldve done British baking show rules and given Marisa the time she lost back! Not done yet but hope she places higher than 4th
"Today we're all wife guy."  I spit my water because holy molly  Also reason why chocolate cake is better with oil because the cocoa molecules bind better to all oil than butter which is mixture of water in oil. Cocoa powder is hydrophobic, hence they hate water with passion but make sure to put the oil last because it will deflate once that oil got in.
Eugene has never been to a gay wedding? That's surprising. I hope he has a good queer community around him.
Honestly I'm almost more focused on the wedding attire the guys and the guests have on than the actual baking XD
So who did Eugene's mom behead...
If I were to have a wedding(which I don't plan on, even then I like pie better) I'd have a pho wedding cake all cute, but then I'd have presliced cake to serve Or cupcakes cause they are better. That way, people won't have to worry too much about lugging it around, and if it gets messed up, it's good cause it's not the real thing. This is my preference, I've just seen too many people have their cakes messed up, it melting, tipping, not fitting and then having to transport the whole thing is a Nightmare! 😱😅
"I did make a good cake on the show no one watched" stop making me feel guilty
NOT THE WIFE GUY 💀💀💀💀💀
omg i’m early asf slayy
“Gay weddings are annoying”  - Jonny Cakes
Team divorce for the win
Zack is getting bolder and it’s everything
Omg Keith looks beautiful
Keith should've been wearing the puffy wedding dress he made in the no instructions video... He looked so beautiful ❤
Zach throwing dark dark shade
Eugene being Anti-Cake & Anti-Marriage got me dead😂😂😂
Too much?? Man, only cheaters do math!
Eugene's mother is correct, coffee cake kicks ass.
