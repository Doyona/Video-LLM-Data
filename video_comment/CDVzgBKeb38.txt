I don’t understand the KFC commercial.
0:56 NAH THAT'S CRAZYYY!!! Especially "wanna learn english?"
the first ad is not even an ad, its a PSA
Teenage mutant nigga turtle in the bathroom 😅😅
The underwater camera got me smiling
2:19 ... KSI had already seen this Ad twice in 2 seperate reacts videos.. also KSI acting like hes seen it for the first time in his life "dementia"
2:06 mental note all: this was in 2010
@3:30 PLAN! -jf,11'25pm,26.6jun.25-thu
I got shown the first one back at school
JJ was traumatised by the first ad
Original video link?
Ayooo
WHY THAT FIRST ONE THAT ONE RANDOMLY COMES INTO MY MIND AND TERRIFIES ME 😖
that first one is just very sad
3:30 pop rocks commercial is mad bro wtfff 5:50 ohh i see what they did they're that's how we tap the buttom of the ketchup bottle to get it out mad
Most of these are just sexual lol
toothpaste got me...
Top COMMENT IS GAY
What percentage of the 6 million subscribers on this channel are women, cause they're being portrayed so badly in these videos 😂
5:07 proud czech moment
pop rocks is funny
2:06 is jokes😂
That made me really uncomfortable 😣
JJ not making any inappropriate jokes for inappropriate ads is crazy
Wow 😂
did JJ forget that he's watched that Australian KFC advert years ago? 💀💀
❤
bro this is really funny
2:26 bars! I mean what????
3:17 3:19 3:27 3:28 3:29 she really gave the teacher an amazing time suckkk the best most incredible time she gave him LOVE and LUST in
3:40 where did the donald laugh come from😂??
Bro that first clip sent me flying in my bed
I had absoluetely no idea what adverts were before today
for the one in the ocean he has my respect
3:29 no way, wtf.
That candy advert was wild AF💀
ethan still waiting on that pop rocks review btw
the aus kfc ad did happen, though it was pulled because of a bunch of US crybabies
In the first one, the final shot is of the woman's face and hands covered in a bunch of blisters and blood. The editors of this video cut it out because it's a bit grim.  It's called "Top Chef" from the WSIB in Canada.
These are good advertisements. How can anyone object to them? It shows how sensitive today's society is. 😂🤦🏼‍♂️
I'm sorry but what idiot describes a handjob as getting tomato sauce out of a bottle like wtf🤣🤣
The pop rocks bro 2 things why and also interesting I could see people doing that
That first video we got showed in collage when I was getting my nvq in catering and many more like it, I can no longer walk past something on the floor in a busy kitchen or work place aha
Since 18(69) - Ketchup commercial
It started strong 😅
100 year gang
0:57 Classic advert.
1:30 it's Dutch so it's definitely not banned, since we're no pussies like Americans when it comes to language
that first one hit me like a mike tyson hook holy shit i remember that
The first one , they showed that to us in highschool before we wen't out on a coop placement
they need to react to the dorito advert compilation
bro their reaction to the kfc ad is bs, half of jj's and deji's old videos should be banned if they think that was too much
I don't get the kfc one!!
0:55 “there r no accidents prevent it” 😭
That was not the originally banned Dorito commercial that was edited because wtf type it up the ending is different and it’s a different guy 😂
1:37  second I saw it I was thinking about mbappe
The second one (the I Wanna Fuck You in the Ass one) was only possible through other languages lol
Was the clip when the guy is cumming skittles all over that woman in the wedding dress ever on TV? 😂 I just remembered that scene now for some reason😂
So the ketchup clip is not really a commercial. It's from a Swedish movie called Hip Hip Hora. Was pretty good when we were 10 or something. It's obviously translated into another language. But the scene is exactly that.
Anyone know the actress name at 6:05 ?
Bro i swear i though i was on the wrong site when that pop rocks ad played 💀
the pop rocks one is actually crazy bro
i thought the first one was about a condom commercial, you know, "accident" and "grease".
👌 Promo-SM
Omg that pop rock advert cannot be real😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 that has to be the funniest shit I’ve ever seen lol the employees who made that ad should be fired to Kingdom Come lolol😂😂😂    Edit: I take it back the ketchup ad is the funniest shit I’ve ever seen😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:17 “Are they all deaf”   JJ think about what you’re saying 😂😂😂😂
💀
The sue Sheffield video is what I was shown in college studying a culinary course. To show us how dangerous the kitchen can be.
Well, now I gotta make up a presentation for pop rocks like I'm going to the shark tank, wish me luck.
u guys should make longer videos kindly
Kinda awesome how these adverts found a way to get banned and yet be seen by millions of more potential customers through a sidemen video^^
Pop rocks are an American candy! They still sell them today and are popular with younger kids
i ain't buyin' non of thous things
Just saying i was in an adult store they actually have a popping candy for that reason 🤣🤣🤣
pop rock ad is really rocked
Popping candy... waste of time... Stick with the throat numbing spray.
bro the one is soo werid
they sell poprocks in australia
1:07 for anyone wondering, that was dutch.
The ketchup one is actually from a swedish movie. No idea if they actually used it for a commercial 🤔
Minor inconvenience  0:47
Pop rock stocks after this video 📈
3/960k
As a kitchen assistant that advert pops in my monthly training 0:27 😂
I love how they keep doing these reacts when 9/10 videos they’ve already either seen or reacted to💀 none of these 10 year olds would know tho I guess so might as well pretend like it’s new
That ketchup ad is taken from a swedish teen movie from 2004 "hip hip hora" (hip hip whore, in swedish)
The fact that ksi doesn’t remember the racist kfc commercial is crazy 😂😂😂
Czech republic included!💯🇨🇿🗣️
CZ best ADVERTS 😂😂 Ketchup😂😂
yall need a better camera
Hi
The pop rocks one was banned for working to well 😂. Had all four sideman searching the Web after 🤣
That first Ad they show you in highschool in Canada when they are trying to convince you to go out into the workplace 😂
Who has tried the pop rocks ad 😂😂 ….✋🏻
4:06 bro just got a yeast infection
Pop rocks and last one gote me XD
I think that pop rocks ad is onto something🧐
i thought vikk left
Im an Australian, and yes that advertisement did run. It actually ran for MONTHS 😂😂
Kai acting like he didn't react to the KFC ad in 2016
2:50 i mean what's wrong?? do black people not consume chicken more than every other race??? people nowadays are triggered and offended by actual facts lol.
Bro i can't beleive the ketchup one was czech 🤣🤣🤣rah I forgot they banned that
I didn’t and still don’t get the kfc one
PRIME should buy Pop Rocks..
The KFC add sounded like it was one of ours, didnt see anything wrong with it tbh he was simply telling the truth
3:15
why do ppl from london seem its impossible to connect kfc with blacks, youre all whipped get away from europe, go dollar up, you pretty them
Man if commercials were funnier but tasteful I’m sure people would enjoy them more often instead of only saving them for the fucking Super Bowl
First side reacts that had me laughin out loud in awhile cheers
1:55  2:06
1:55
Repost
the toothpaste ad was just wild
does the pop candy thing work??
that ketchup ad is a scene taken straight from a swedish movie (hipp hipp hora) and they just straight up remade it into an ad lol
Wrong Vic. Unfortunately here in Australia we've gone just as woke as the rest of the world
Off to a great start!
1:33 ok so Kermit gets the cucumber and the ninja turtles gets the pickles 😂
*cough* pop rocks bj’s are amazing *cough*
That aussie kfc ad was real. And it actually was on tv for a bit. I know i remeber seeing it on tv😂😂
I need to invest in some pop rock😂😂😂
The dude in the top left has such a big hairline.    Like it’s offsides
See it’s men and women like you nowadays who need to man up
There is nothing wrong and bad with any of theses adverts at all
Remember the based Carl's Jr ads with the sexy women eating a bit of the burgers. Those were good.
5:45-5:55 JJ’s facial expressions are gold 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You lot have a whole reacts channel but don't know about the genocide in Gaza? Clowns
The ketchup one is from 🇨🇿😂😂
Pop rock are coming tomorrow… 😅
petition for part 2?
Why’d I just get the notification
It's been a long time since this channel had something this funny :D
Next vid, pop rocks sponsor 😂
5:11  my mind was so set on English and I was annoyed that I would have to read subtitles that I didn’t even notice at first it was my mother language 😂
question is why dont these companies drop these ads on pornhub or something?
There's no way this video is over 8 minutes long and there isn't a single Irn-Bru ad
Everyone else in the sidemen is so funny  Ethan and KSI I like your tattoo and KSI I like your hair
They do sell pop rocks in a lot of adult stores for a reason lol
The scream won’t leave me alone
COOL VIDEO 🎉🎉🎉 0:18
POG innit bruv fam
JJ saying they're deaf when them bopping along to music 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Czech 🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿
the first time I see czech republic mentioned and its in this vid, dont know how i feels about that-
Ksi thinking about using the pop rocks ad idea, but for prime... *Stonks* (both the sales and... the ad revenue, of course)
They showed that first advert in my catering college and it is absolutely scarring. I hate that advert so much and I never thought I'd see it again 😭 Shook our whole classroom
Why are most of these oral related 😂
😆🤣💪💚
the first one is a new fear unlocked
World has gone soft
Anyone here after Ethan Was banned on tiktok
Ksi fight jake paul
Pop Rocks to the moon
Should check out thai ads. And Japan too
We are here and not going anywhere
We are here and not going anywhere
We are here and not going anywhere
We are here and not going anywhere
Make this most liked for them to watch Timelapse of the universe
jj had a completely different reaction to 2:23 a few years ago 😂
2:12 well well well 👴😂
Streets remember ksi reacting to that kfc clip years ago
PSA: It's not a great idea to have sugar near your genitals.
That Pop Rocks one was wild💀
Tell me they didn't steal that Heinz ad from hipp hipp hora?? Where my swedes at
Pop rock blow jobs are old school
Who's the woman in the candy pop advert, asking for a friend.      Also I have no friends.
I've never got why the chicken thing is offensive. I'm black as F*** and I love chicken! My parents love chicken! Like you can't tell me you've meet a black person that doesn't love chicken but anyway why's it bad thing to like chicken?????
Those prevent it ads fucked me up as a kid. Look at all of them.
JJ already reacted to the cricket ad
pop rock commercial legit worked tho XD
Ethan is disgusting 🤢
we watched the first ad in food,tech in yr 7 in my school😭
They have se.’ual poprocks
3:48 Cumbusting Candies 💀
whats with the wierd tiktoks guys
what did I just watch...
pop rocks whilegetting head ufff amazing lol
1 of the tag lines on the Heinz advert said Jiz 😂 aswell
That kfc commerical used be played in australia haha i remember it when i was young haha
I swear they’ve reacted to that toothpaste commercial like three times 😂
I actually pray we hear the report back, itd be so funny 😂
That first one was horrifying!
I was taking a bite of a pickle when the ninja turtle commercial started 😶
Adverts??? Why not just Ads if your gonna abbreviate 😂😂
That Heinz ketchup girl looked like Lazarbeam's girlfriend.
Why is Ethan pretending to be so dumb? Every video he repeatedly does this. 😢😢
worlds gone soft most of these ads are class
Where is TOBI?
2:11 older ksi fans will know he’s already reacted to this
I’m dead 😂😂😂😂😂
nahh the pop rocks thing scares me  Can men get yeast infections? Or maybe just a pop rock in somewhere no candy should ever go oof ouch owie no
Kfc 😂 pretty racist 😂
Oi Bez where's the report yeah some of us need to know boss
For the first clip, I actually watched it in police class.. this is about security.. it’s talking about when someone did something faulty/bad that could cause an injury but u got injured because u didn’t wear equipment or take proper precaution, it would be ur fault and not the person that made the mess in the first place…
2:10 I think Ethan was being serious
🦖🐢🐢❄️❄️☃️
we had to watch the first clip for my foods class in jr high and ever since ive been terrified that'd happen to me
been a cook for about 10 years.. that first clip still gets me lol
LMAO the first one was a Canadian commercial i remember they had this one and a few other tramatising ones when i was in school
Two minutes in my brother laughs like a callofdutyzombie 😂😂😂😂
crazy that they all are married now except jj
You may have seen it already but try the Antz Pantz " sic em Rex" commercial, from Australia.     Also the Angry Panda ads.
That kfc one was gold though, they still do the same thing here in Australia just different all kinds of race
the toothpaste one is unreal
Where's the link to the original video? For uh... research purposes...
The woke Sidemen strike again
Can you put callux, freezy and Randolph  on this channel and give them another shocking video😂
7:17, the guy turning into brown toothpaste might be a bit much. but other than that i dont think its too bad.
5:09 czechia mentioned rahhh🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
When are we getting the whole sidemen reacting together 😮‍💨
1:17 this is a dutch add from the 90s 😂
I swear JJ reacted to half of these ads years ago?
lmao
The dutch advert Lmao
The moment I saw it, I just knew the second clip was a Dutch one
dorito one was a remake
That first commercial was part of a whole series of similar commercials. I never knew there was a problem with them. They always used to play
Can we actually get a report back from Ethan? Cheers.
im so high i literally didn't notice josh💀 I only noticed him at the end when I went out of fullscreen
I’m buying pop rocks
I knew Czech adverts are wild, but that ketchup ad was something else.
I’m from Czech and I can’t believe I have seen the ketchup ad for the first time on sidemen reacts💀
Where is tobi?
JJ saying "are they all deaf?". What the hell... How would they enjoy the music if they were deaf...? lmao  And of course Ethan agrees. lol
Ethan Garrat????????
They should of watched the Condom one
I've used Pop Rocks, don't do it 🤣
The pop rocks commercial is comedy sketch lol I saw it a few years back.
2:50 that was taken way out of context I feel, that was an innocent add caught in a bad time
Bruh that thumbnail is wild but then theres skittles
Don’t do it guys, i can tell you from experience it just gets sticky and its not a good sticky its actually kind of unpleasant.
Dark humor is the best humor. 1st time I've laughed in one these in a long time 😂
They should see the VW commercial.... It was the bomb
Svear to God, The ketchup one is originally from a Swedish movie
Oh the Aussie kfc cricket ads were fucking savage back in the day lmao
vik ruins every video
I didn’t know the UK doesn’t have pop rocks. Been eating those since I was little
That popping candy one was MAD! 🤣
Ex did the pop rocks thing, not a fan.
My girl and I tried the pop rocks thing years ago
I miss watching the Doritos commercials live
man i wish i could travel back in time. hehe
bro wtf are all of these
03:15 WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF who, why, when, how. tf??
Everyone in England just brought Pop Rocks.
0:15 They do know Justin Beiber is a Zionist right?
JJ laugh at the end 😭😭😭😭
Dum: 0:01 Unf 3:52
Ok
i man maturing as i grow up so tend not to enjoy sidemen anymore, i have to say eat ham laughing at that first clip really finished it, your nearly 30 laughing at someone scolding there hole body, may not be real but that doesn’t matter
actually a picked a video to react to that i haven't seen a 1000 times, nice. I only actually seen only two of these & Doritos doin a thing
Adverts are either amazing or straight shit,no in between
when the imposter is sus
I've seen that kfc advert on British TV advert about 10 years ago lol
I remember growing up that it was basically a competition between Doritos and bud light when it came to funniest commercials in America at least
for the first time ever JJ remembered that he's watched a video before
Faith gonna see pop rocks via post 😂
That Czech ad had me dying 😭🤣🤣🤣
I think I gotta buy pop rock stocks for a day now
KFC, too easy!
first one was showed to us in our first year culinary school. Its a good lesson that accidents dont happen its laziness
I remember seeing the poprocks and Doritos commercials
Ethan and jj need to report back fr (im single)
I listened to half of these with just the audio and the popping candy one was madddddd 😂 love these four together tho. Two sensible and two childish ones 😂. Keep up the amazing worlk!! ❤
2:20 I remember this ad on tv ahaha
Ethan, JJ, Vikk and Josh
Nice to see you in Galway, Vikk and Harry….
Finally a 4 people reaction
Finally a quality upload
The ketchup ad 😭😭😂😂💔
pop rocks commercial is gonna get so many kids UTI's ...
Ive tried the pop rock thing many times and yes i highly recommend it
we neeeed a part 2 plss
i feel this videos gunna be bannned
Non of these were banned because they were all aired in their countries.
What was the KFC ad pls explain
0:34 This is one our Training videos for Culinary here 😱🤣🤣
Here within an hour not too bad
JJ literally did that in the what’s it like to be black video Lol 2:32
That heinz advert comes from a Swedish movie called the ketchup effect on English, which that is a real scene.
Lol how coincidental with the pickle ad considering what happened today with Drake 😂
what was 2:10 all about?   I didn't get it?
JJ's face during the 2nd doritos ad was hilarious
Typical Czech ad for ketchup 🤣🤣
so do the pop rocks work or?
2:57
For the first one, that was a PSA that would play in Ontario, Canada, on kids channels of all places. It's been permanently ingrained in my brain at this point.
YO
Common KFC W
So that's how they used to have fun...
I remember the kfc ad from over the 00s
there are pop rocks in Africa (Botswana)
Damn these were wild bruh
This year's uploads have been bangers so far 💯
Pop Rocks stock 📈
2:25 JJ you have reacted to this in your r*cist adverts video where you roasted shah rukh khan as well.
Yo ethan might be the next Chris from Mr.Beast
Anyone else actually want that feedback on Pop Rocks? I gotta know if it's worth trying 😂
Fun Fact; Its Sounds FX, not Sound Effects. Means the same thing though
Fate...
Where’s the banned skittles commercial?
I love how the Sidemen never fail to make us laugh with their reactions. Pure entertainment!
I can't stop laughing at their reactions, it's so entertaining!
the racism is elite
5:10 s čím jinym než se zrovna něčim takovym by se češi mohli na tenhle kanál dostat😂
KSI sounds so fake for some reason wtf. like he is forcing the stuff he is saying and doing.
WHAT THE FUCK
I literally got pop rocks in a American mystery box yesterday lol
I'd love to see a sidemen cheap vs expensive magic show. Two teams, they each have to create their own magic tricks and do a performance for people. One team gets a professional magician to help them create their tricks, the other team gets like a book or Phil or something.
ethan if you try that with poping candy your probably end up with a yeast infection on you d!ck because you shouldn't put sugar down there
KSI already forgot about the KFC advert.
Not even first
🔥
Too easy 💀
Here's a tip, don't do that with pop rocks. It hurts like crazy
W kfc ad
Just so you know the pop rocks ad is a thing. It’s called a blow pop 😅 and just gonna let ya know it is soooo underrated. Lol. Highly recommend 😅😅
I beg whoever looks over sidemen reacts tell ksi and tobi to come to carlow since they're in ireland just really want to meet them been watching them for time
If you guys are reading this, please check out South African banned adverts. They are funnier and more ridiculous than this😂
CZECH REPUBLIC ADVERTISMENT !!!!!!!
My mam just saw JJ and Tobi in limerick station in Ireland today
8 minutes is crazy
pop rocks commercial is real. Remember watching it as a kid on nickelodeon and my mom freaked out and changed the channel. Only aired once from my knowledge.
GET JOSH OUTTA THE SIDEMEN
The pop rocks actually is good for that lol
Jesus loves u
😭😭
Irn Bru ads>>>
Back in the 90s we had a very different sense of humor. People didn't get as offended as they do now and you could get away with a lot more, that is the truth.
Sidemen should make an ad that just touches the boundary of offensive
kinda want some fresh fried chicken now
I love how most of the ads worked on them, even making them order Pop Rocks lmfao.
That pop rocks advert is wild 😮
The candy ad was wild
“If adverts were more like this, I might actually buy some” …. Proceeds to buy some popping candy.
czech republic mentioned that is a w
The teacher one is wild
lol we actually cooking on this channel 😂😂😂
That scream was chilling
All of a sudden pop rocks sales have sky rocketed 😂
I like the reacts where it’s 3-4 people. It’s like a nice chaos
Growing I saw some the these commercials before they were banned 😂
you need to reaction to Thailand ads too.. so hilarious
Love your videos guys you should do one video in Nepal ❤🇳🇵
The pop candy ad wild 💀😭
5:05 tahle reklama někdy byla v Česku?
Who want  these 4 to react to more family guy😣
