T34/85 side armor yes it's not too thick
Jimmy Kimmel over here
Just dip the whole tank into the liquid nitrogen tank then smash it with something and mission accomplished
Reporting this video for promoting terrorism. Putting the president in the tank and showing a man violently smashing open the tank... yeah, really smart.

Why is Trump inside of there?
That's fine i got time. I also have the perfect size hammer.
Why Trump inside 😂😂😂😂
prob payed him to appreciate his products
What's Trump doing in there?
Why is trump thete HAHA
You stupid or what? Changing the structure? What is this organic material or what? This shit is FUCKING METAL, its ALREADY SOLID, cooling it make it harder, and hammering it only bring it more energy just so it can increase a few Kevin.
What Donald Trump doin there💀
Not to mention modern tanks use composite armors, so this would do even less damage.
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Or just use gallium
Gallium probably would get the job done
Bro creating wrong facts 😭😭😭 then telling us its not possible 😭😭
"i swear that t-34 armor aint that thick." -my brain after suffering in war thunder with t-34-
Bros definition of “A scratch” 💀
Trump aka krasnov spying for Russia🤣☝️
The ending made me laugh so hard bro trump ?? Wtf 😂😂😂
Mercury would work better
I hope this isn't a training video for anybody cause yikes
Is that trump

Doland Trump 😂😂😂😂
Dexter trying to destroy a Tank
Try it with thermite
what the trump doin
Pretty sure you could scratch it with just the car size hammer lol
Kkkkkkk
Most people
At that point just use thermite
This is just like Dunkirk for me,  Zack.D.Flims is being overran by stinky little motherfuckers that don't know how to count to 10, so I retreat to here.
Why is Anakin doing this?
I'm sure that a hammer the size of a car could break a tank even without liquid nitrogen
The t34 shatters by sneezing on it
Wait, Trump is that you ??? 😅😅😅
trump noo!
Is that maga in their
WTF trump doing in Russian T34?😂😂😂😂

Nobody thought so
Trump 😂😂
What if you put LIQUID NITROGEN on a modern tank
Bro is not ZackDFilms
Is Stalinium Really That Weak?
"Thick armor"    Proceed to show a 4.5cm thick of steel
Useless content
Trump got me when they open at the left😂😂😂😂
Was that Donald Trump in a Soviet WWII T-34/85?
Or Just use Iron Man's Tank Missile. 😂
If you think this guy actually makes informed of videos you’re an idiot
Most people don’t think that because it’s just not true and I’ve never heard anyone say that but at least what your costing is true
Dude has personal issues with trump 😂
Seeing as this is a t 34 even without the liquid nitrigen you could break it's armour lol
Nahhh i would pour gallium
Trump being caught: uhhh yeah, I'm the best commie there is. Such a big commie out there, but you destroyed my tank like my acting career. Guards, seize him!
What in the world is my man Donald J trump chilling inside a Soviet T34 for?

Wow

Doland Trump😂
Trump just chilling
WHO IS GONNA THINK NP IS GONNA STAP A WW2 TANK
Mmm, a nitrogen rocket head with another explosive head. That would be awesome.
I was gnna say same shit trump was inside the tank
use thermite :D
tonk
It takes hours to cool metal of any reasonable thickness to a temp that would embrittle.
Most people actually believe that?
Didn't expect Trump 😂😂😂😂
What about gallium?
go is a disgrace t-34/85 that trump is a disgrace
The ending was gold😂😂
To tak nie działa.  😂😂😂😂
Zack d films on a budget
You don’t need a hammer the size of a car, just a hammer made out ot tungsten will do.
Not all tank armor is thick, tank armor is weaker on top and at the back
😂😂😂😂
we need this in palestine is this still work ?
Это так не работает
Bro,damaged silver button😂😂
Hey Taco
You don’t change the structure
Doland trump
The ending 💀
Liquid nitrogen would boil the moment it leaves the Dewer. Stupid argument that no one advocates for.
You could just used some thermite
No that's Because people are stupid
Trump bought the Tank
Le métal conduit très facilement la chaleur ou le froid et c'est pas quelques centimètres qui vont te faire attendre plusieurs heures. En réalité c'est en secondes...
What was Trump doing inside?!😂😂😂😂
I hate when people think either it is normal steel, not many thick, and hate when THEY ARE THINKING IT IS VERY THICK NORMAL STEEL TOO RRRHHAAAA
Why was trump sitting inside
😮
Nooooooo T_34
What about gallium
100+ missed calls from zackdfilms
i wonder if galium could make the metal soft. Any thoughts?
Zack d carrier in danger
Why is Trump in a Russian tank
Trump inside a T34. didn't see it coming
If you put galium on an aluminum tank it will ruin it.
Stalinium destroyed with only a hammer and nitrogen
🤣🤣Trump inside
O
This also means that maybe, If you get alot of people to shoot nitrogen at a tank, and then another tank shoots it, it will shatter
Trump in a T-34-85 is wild lol
Trump’s been passing executive orders in a tank before being busted.
It’s alllll about the alloy
"Just to be able to scratch it"  Proceeds to obliderate it
How in the fucking hell...trump and a soviet scrap?
In those application there is always research about toughness of metal will be used and there is an impact test on selected temperature on metal before start production.
Most people dint think about nonsense
Wtf trump doing in IS 2😂
T-34 mentioned
zaprojektowac pocisk taki ktory przed kontaktem pizga sprejem dzieki czmu ma latwa pene
Hi
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What the yart is trump doing inside a Soviet T-34
😂 last twist revealed
For reference, you could barely crush a frozen tennis ball with a hammer, nevermind tank armor
just to scratch it, huh
Bro is trying to be Zack so bad 😂
Most ppl definitely don't think that lol
knock off zach D films
This is completley innacurate, no amount of liquid nitrogen and car sized hammers can defeat pure stalinium
No, just, , , no
Trust me, you don't need liquid nitrogen to shatter T-34 armour
Trash game, time consuming
The tank IS bulletproof
Wonder why trump hiding in a soviet tank 😂
Russian's Agent 47 found.
How bout gallium ?
i  never even thinking about breaking a thank with liquid nitrogen, but that was a good idea tho 😂
How about galium?
Trump was hiding in tank after simpsin files got leaked
Spoiler trumps inside
What the fuck is trump doing in Soviet T-34-57
How did trump get there😅
Remember one scene in certain famous movie where a liquid cop gets frozen in liquid nitrogen and was shot by a cyborg with human skin and said "Hasta la vista, baby".
Who tf is wondering all this ?
Trump is double agent 😢
Would the canon barrel be weaker ?
Drum😂
Hi, can you tell me, how I make this video too, please
Liquid nitrogen can't shatter steel beam's!

Who thinks these things this way
No one thinks that
Dexter that you
trump: american t-34:  soviet also bro casually just shattering stalinium is insane
Trump never thought of chilling in a modern tank with composite armor
Zack D. Films version 0.5 made in china
Lava would be better than Liquid Nitrogen -                                         Steve Minecraft 2025 😁
No they dont. No one thinks that.
I really wonder who “most people” is
Actually, nobody thinks that
Seeing Trump in there is diabolical 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why do I see Donald Trump in side the tank?
nvm
omg bruh so cute
Wud da trump doin?
Try nitroglycerin
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
Why’d they put trump in there?
Science is cool.
Interesting
Why is anakin skywalker assaulting Trump?
You have to superheat it after doing that and then it would shatter
T-34 armor shattered without it
So you weren't on the diddy list?
All this stress just to say hello to Trump? 😅
You could probably scratch it with a sharp rock
T-34 is made of Stalium, so, armor won't break never
Aatrox when hit
Who thought that? Nobody nobody thinks they can shatter tank armour with a such simple thing like liquid nitrogen
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Why was Trump needed in this? Lol
LIQUID!
Why is there a t-34 ww2 soviet tank there
Yeah..... That's all ok   But why's trump in the tank😅😅
Why trump
POV: Trump 😮
trump?
Don’t think anyone has ever thought that
Gallium on the other hand.....would work 😂
Of course Trump is hiding in a T-34
But gallium on the other hand....
Using thermite you can do it 😊😊
"A hammer the size of a car, just to be able to scratch it." *Blows a hole in said tank*
What is this off brand Zack d films shi
Zack finally got a right opponent💀
I want Zack d films  Mom: we got it at home
This will work on L3/33
Why tf is trump in a t-34-85
And tanks nowdays arent made of pure steel, it had Composite materials like tempered glass, Fibers, and others
You just need 5 gallons of thermite 😅
A smrt prson would know that this video has a msg😮
Anyone else notice Sense that guy tried to assassinate trump it looks like him in these videos
I like that he use a t-34-85
Nah bro T34 is already breaking in half without anything 😅😅
"just to be able to scratch it" proceeds too destroy the entire side of the tank.
okay i don’t know about “most people”
"most people think"?...
This shit is dumb as hell
I don't think most people would think this
That person looks like Kid Danger
Not TRUMP 😂😭🤣😭
Good look with composite armour
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
Hit it with gallium
This is the moment Heisenberg created thermite
But why Trump?
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
Nitrogen vs stallium armor tank t-34
“Most people think”
Wasn't expecting the ending 😂😂
guys copying zack's style
Was not expecting the ending part 😂
"Putin called me a Genius"
What in the ZackDFilms
T-34 armor was overhardened and very brittle, so in this particular case maybe not
wait, that's agent Krasnov
Can't wait to see MythBusters try this one
What of you released nitrogen, then Thermite
Why was trump in a Russian tank subliminal video
Palestinians freedomfighters know what to do

Why do you want to break it? Just find the vent and pour it there
Looked a lot like trump.
I will build a tank wall😂😂😂
Zack B Films.
I think he might be pulling numbers out of nowhere
So why was Donald Trump in the tank at the end
Just put Gallium
Na just go for the hatch
Bro is not Zack d films 😂😂😂
Just to be able to scratch it... Wtf🤣
Trump 🎉😂
Cooling metal does not change its structure. It just becomes brittle, like any solid.
Gallium will do the trick?
Better to just dump in into the engine bay
Made in china armour can be shattered
Sharuk khan hits trump in russian tank
How do you know that
Find JESUS CHRIST before its too late HE died for you and me and risen from dead on the 3 day. so you shall live and your price have to pay when JESUS CHRIST hadnt died for you. so repent today and accept that HE died for you and me and risen up from dead on the 3 day then JESUS CHRIST saves you from judgment find HIM before death arives.
I think the car sized hammer would be sufficient at disabling a tank

Why is Trump in A soviet tank
Thats why the anti tank weapon are twice the size of tank 🤦
This is really funny because u used a t34 and they had really bad armour shattering issues due to bad construction and cold weather
Galium
Is that Donald trump😂😂😅😅
Trump inside stalinium
Use nitrogen and a blow torch to expand and contract the tank metal which cases lots of damage just like putting glass in a oven then ice water

It's this what you do, steak content from Zach and change the ai?
Who is this most people?
Zack d films copy 😅
well well who's pops out ta da😂😂
99+ missed calls from Zack d films
This gave me chills… in the best way
If you strike even the lightest tank armor really hard with a mallet or normal Hammer it's not really going to do much. Granted. The worst they could do is dent it
Am disappointed that a Soviet bias could not stand to liquid nitrogen
What is this Nitrogen is this?
A better choice would be aluminum
I'm not most people
You wouldn't need liquid nitrogen for a T-34 Soviet heat treating would do that work for you
Last scene was deeper then the knowledge 😂😂😂😂
Donald Trump? “And I would have gotten away with it, I really…. Really… would have, if it weren’t for you commie meddling kids”
Zach d films inspired a lot of people huh 😅
Depends on the tank and the angle
What will happen if Galium is poured?
Trump was just chilling into you break his tank
trump was a soviet tank commander i see
Someone finally got  honest job....
@whistlindiesel
Trump in a Soviet tank🤔 smth ain’t right
Trump should be in a T34 lol
You ia not zake z films
Well no shit
I would use special melting acid
What about gall?
If you need a hammer the size of a car then why even bother with the liquid nitrogen
Bro thinks he's Zack D Films 💀
F/cking ZACH D FILMS COPY!
Who even thinks that you can do that...
*Meanwhile in Gate JSDF:*  *"Can a medieval battering ram break a modern tank armor?"*  Answer:  No but it can damage the threads and gears on the sides but it needs multiple repetitive hits.

No one thought that.
What Trump doing with the Soviets? Fighting for Stalin?
Said no one ever... It can only cool the outer layer. It's a few inches thick.
People don’t need this video
Believe me I was thinking of popping it with straw
Zack D Films is that you😅😅
Who are most people no one thinks that
Off brand Zack D Films
Aww a Libby account. TDS is in fact real in their heads 😂😂
It depends what tank you’re talking about because if it’s a L 33 then yes.
Lately all those "most people would think" videos are like stuff I would never think of thinking🥲
I swear Americans just don't give a F about their own leaders😂 we scrutinize and make fun of anyone bad or good😂 I love this country 🇺🇸
Why is trump in there? 😅 🤣
Don’t you think throwing a car at a tank would already scratch it?
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
I dont think liquid nitrogen can break the armour of a modern mbt (without Era)
Not unless it was a WW2 soviet. Those idiots heat treated or what much hotter than other nations. Standard was around 300 somwthing measurements. Soviet, glorius Stalinium, 600. It was tough but DAMN was it brittle. A shody t34 could even be taken out by a Panzer 3. Source, Lazerpig.
What about if u use a small bit of gun powder
Trump's reaction 😂😂😂
Trump is in his buddy’s T34 😂😂
Bro is destroying his silver play button💀.
Yeah liar liar pants on fier
With a T-34, you don't need the nitrogen- the welding was dismal.
What if it was nitroglycerin?
Use gallium it will eat the metal
Highlight- "just to be able to scratch it"
Fuck nitrogen, use Galium instead
Nobody thinks that
Ya have fun freesing 90mm of pure rolled steel from pouring on one side of it and thinking it will break, you would have to do that with like a fuckin l3/33c not a fuckin t-34-85 buddy
Because of how bad the quality of Soviet tanks are you can probably bracket easier than what he said
the area that was hit has only a thickness of around 45mm or almost 2 inches of rha
Break a Tank 🔨🔫💔
zack d films where are you?
No president was harmed in the video 😅😅😅😅😅

Brother is building unlimited enderman farms 😂😂😂
Home made Zack D Flims
Pin me 📍📍📌
why does that guy look like anakin
Nobody knows
I mean it probably would with a T-34 their heat treated their armour far too much making it brittle
Calling it Scratch it Ended up breaking it
i just did the math and this is fake for most common war tanks
This Idea got from Terminator 2 movie😅
Nah brah, all i need is is my commandos and some thermite
Why trump in these wars events
that one guy pouring it into barrel:
Mr President, the Zach D clone with a comically large hammer and 5 hours worth of liquid nitrogen is here!!
Bro u ain’t zackdflims
President trump?
Trumps new limo,putin his driver, and Kim his gunner. World take over.
Why Trump inside the tank😂
fun fact: sometimes the armor on the T-34 (the tank in this video) cracked when shot at
Or thermite
democracy under attack
Nah, even President Trump is being affected by the tariffs. 💀
