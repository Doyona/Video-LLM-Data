what the....
How did I miss this
What was the point of cutting to the boring people sitting down ?
This sounds like dance movie soundtrack. Where is the singing or melody
I love seeing the 80s in 25! How does Kenny still look the same?
The backup dancer stole the show , uk which one 🦹🏼
Is he the saxophonist from the Friday Night music video by Katy Perry ?
Why is glo looking like that…
She's great! Is she pregnant? She looks about 3 to 4 months
She can move but sing ? Nah …
Can someone pls help me how to remove the audience noise from the dance break part? ☹️🙏🏻
Wait!!! I didn’t know she can dance 😂🔥🔥🔥
The haka inspired hand movements and facial expressions are so good 😙 did nobody else notice that? 🥝
Good performance but why wasn't a live show???
idk why but it gave janet vibes
Why is no one talking about her intro being the same as Eminem’s music video “Rap God”.
Checker board floor? Hmm
Can we PLEASE give it up for the background guitar 🎸 players/dancers?!?!!!  If there were ever icing on a cake, BABYYYYYY…that was the sweetest!  ⚡️ 💥 💙🩷💜
beyoncé who?
Why does she have a bandana wrapped around her ankle? It’s so random for it to be there its as if she was trying to hide a ankle monitor 😅
Really ?
Why am I thinking Micheal’s beat was sampled?
Loved this whole performance! So, when can we get this version of the song too? 🤩
How is it that Kenny G looks the EXACT same that he did 20 years ago!?!??? Like, what??!? 🤯🤯🤨🤔🧐😲😳
3:49 why is this move so amazing to watch 🔥🔥
Is there anyone else watching this performance over and over? I am shook by these dance moves she has!
Is it just me or did time fly watching this?
is there something she cant do?
Where’s the Perfume & Brand… Gorgeous by D-Cat….
is she just lip syncing?
What was that?!
how did she do that 2:23
Is she back to normal?
Am I the only one who thinks Doja Cat's style on this show reminds me of JoJo's bizarre adventure? She’s absolutely stunning!
Okay two things she needs to release remix feat kenny g and I need to know what top she was wearing😭
Not everyone lying that this was a good performance? It felt so out of place. I love Doja but this was odd - Kenny G playing the intro and disappearing, and the song falling nowhere close to the vibe of the sax, followed by her dance also being off the songs vibe. The only part I enjoyed was when she started rapping. But everything looks forcefully tied together.
no notes. wtf.
Anyone see the Price beats ? I see Prince influences there  And Paula Abdul too. The rythme and the dance. Live "Opposite Attract"
Is there any dance style sh hasn't mastered? 😳 Consider me impressed
What in the 80s illuminati is this?.😂
Tate is a great dancer but does she have this conviction? Idk
Was that the girl from dhar Mann in the crowd
Guys, does anyone know who the guitarist is that appears at the end of the performance?
Was it just me, or did she perform like Michael Jackson?
Could this be the best upload yet?
Idk if this is right but I think her dance is a tribute to Michael Jackson
I ponder if we saw the same thing. ❤
Why no one mentioned Kenny G performed on this set on VMA commentary!!❤
Wait a minute she really got Kenny G 🤗
Piano guitarist is a boy or a girl?😅
She got Chapel Roan and Nas X as background dancers?
1:00 was Doja doing the spirt fingers?❤🤪😆
Was that rap god?
I wanna know so bad who sings the trumpet 🎺😭
Is it Friday night watching much more music? I feel like doja could revive it I'd watch it just for her
Love the song hope this isn't a ritual...look up Madonna dress u up live...virgin tour🤔
how can this only have half a mil views when i've already replayed it a million times
We left the 80s behind for a reason. Why revisit it?? Just create something new. Geeze
Pierce Hawthorne's father?????
Every year she levels up but this?? this is NEXT LEVEL
Did ahe break her abkle or somehtung why she wearing flats
Greatest loving performers giving whole package. Beyoncé, Doja Cat, Next question.
How does she do it? Bravo 👏
Anyone knows the names of those 3 female background dancers?

Is... is that a max headroom reference
Is that Kenny G?
2:48 the guy to the right of the screen.. am I crazy or is that not one of Sabrina’s main dancers that hasn’t danced with her recently….
0:16 Is this a sign for jealous type Extended (mtv remix) version?? Whaaaaaaahh✨✨✨
Why is nobody talking about her Max Headroom impersonation?? Literally iconic
1:51 *genuinely confused on whos singing? cus her mouth is singing the backing part?* *anyways she mf KILLLLED that stage.. how tf she even do det? **2:24** naw thats sorcery lmfao 🤔*
WTF?! She can lock n pop that nice?

Did anyone else dream of being on the falling couch on this exact same stage as a child or nah
Did anyone notice Kenny G in this video? He’s such a talented and brilliant musician!
Why did you upload this at night??

Is that Kenny G playing the soprano saxophone in the beginning?
Who is rewatching it again?
