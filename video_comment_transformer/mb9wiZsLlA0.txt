What do you think about the changes Costco is making?
Costco on an average car you shopping baskets will fit in one car Would you offer a delivery service Member, would we would take home refrigerated and frozen products
Why did Costco changed its closing time on Saturday to 7.00 pm? It used to be 8.30pm
What good is the App if there is no Wi-Fi in the store.
OMG was that Louie Anderson dressed as a woman in this video, sitting at the food court?
Does the Costco card really have the member's photo on it?  Not that way at Sam's.  Just wondering how accurate this narrator is, if she's even human.  I suspect it's AI.
Wondering why the video kept showing the lady that looks like Louie Anderson  ? Related ?
Was that Louie Anderson in a wig?
Costco in Shenzhen China? lol Their economy is crashing, people have no jobs no money to spend, companies leaving China. lol
If they’re going to raise membership cost, why not also increase the annual cash back for Executive members?
How about a Senior rate for membership to keep us coming back?
Why do they have Louis Anderson dressed in drag in this video?
Did anyone else spot the late great comedian Louie Anderson?  That dude was great.  Comment the time stamp if you saw him.
Fresno just got a new Costco a couple of years ago. Why build a new supersized one there?

at 1:09 was it my imagination or was that Louis Anderson dressed as a woman?
Wondering if Magic Spoon cereal has been distributed nationwide or selected stores. Haven’t seen it in the tri state area. It’s a really good healthy and delicious alternative to sugar saturated crappy ones
I don’t understand why Costco cares if other people share cards due to making extra sales?
1:10 - was that Louie Anderson?!😮
Is that Louie Anderson with a wig on 😳
How about bringing some healthy options in the food court in Costco Canada? The food court is disgusting right now...

Are they ever going to bake without palm oil ?  I'd like to not destroy the rain forests.
Any word on expanding the number of Costco Car Washes?  🚙
@1:10 holy shit is that louie Anderson?
Why has Costco Canada discontinued the coffee at the food court? We do not have the cheeseburger or the brisket at the food court either.
Ummmm how and why, does Louie Anderson seem to be in this entire video? 😳🤷🏻‍♂️😂 God rest. 🙏🏽
If the churro was so popular why take it away?
Has Costco added a Scan&go feature to its app that is the same or better than Sam’s Club?  The absence of that fantastic feature is a dealbreaker for my needs.  I prefer not to drag a load of warehouse goods to a random cashier or slow, overcrowded self-checkout kiosk.
How about putting a bathroom not only in the front of the store for people but in the back also.
4:22 is that Louie Anderson ?
Is that Louie Anderson in the black dress? 3:50 I was joking, but the teeth are a match! 4:25
I thought a Costco member was allowed to enter with a friend / guest (non-member). This video is unclear whether the new scan represents a change in that.
But most importantly will they change the favouritism of certain employees over others? The 6 Costco's I've worked at in my lifetime were favoritism galore.
Is that Louie Anderson dressed as a woman?
1:10m mark. Is that Louie Anderson portraying a woman shopping at Costco? 😅
Is that luie anderson in drag?
Raising its rates to stay profitable, it already very profitable without raising its rates

Don't know why people like Costco, they are expensive. Prefer Sam's Club.

Does Costco still makes great pizza please e spend topping 😊
We need one, Costco, South of Bend, OR! Instead you’re moving the NEW store North! Farther away, I don’t get it!!
Take away seats? What about the elderly? Disabled? Younger kids who can’t see the tops of tables?   Btw cookies for >$2-3 I’d rather buy from the bakery…  Also… for the executive membership level it needs an update to compete with other membership stores that has unique hours etc
I am suspicious of the App idea. I worry that it will lock me into a credit card I don’t want. My punishment for not using their app and credit card will be to stand in line to check out with fewer checkout lines. If the app is not tied to a Costco credit card I may consider using it.
What about Scan and Go so you can scan the products with your phone and pay on your phone and not have to wait in line.  This is literally the only reason I shop at Sam’s because I don’t have time to wait in the long lines at Costco.
Raising the membership fees to remain profitable??? Seems like Costco is doing just fine with all the openings in the US and overseas.........seems like the CEO wants a bigger paycheck!!
Scanned at the door in what way?  Please tell me this won't be some "facial recognition" nightmare that would make customers quit Costco.

A video idea can you do a tip’s video on how to tell the best produce, how to tell if things are still good to eat, how best to store things as a 101. So it’s all in one video
would be nice if costco had a 1 day free membership for new customers to come in,browse around and purchase something if you found something you wanted but costco doesnt offer that,at least at my local costco it doesnt

Why are the Cesar salads $7 no wonder people don’t eat healthier
Who likes Pepsi?  Costco in Canada accepts only Mastercard, it’s visa in the US.
Wonder what’s taking so long for crib side or pick up . Probably bc they know we would over spend every time we go in lol 😂
the late Louie Anderson in the video as a woman ??
All I want is the old chicken bake, polish dog, and combo pizza back... is that too much to ask for, Costco?
How about just keep staples on the shelves instead of stocking whatever's trendy?
Why would anyone want to pay for the privilege of shopping in someone's store?  Only in America.
When are they bringing the good mesquite wings back? They can get rid of those nasty garlic things.
