Is this movie similar to Jilla? Simbu is adopted by Kamal…like how Vijay was adopted by Mohanlal…?
Why are great directors failing to produce good movies with big actors? Lokesh failed with leo, nelson failed with beast, karthik failed with retro, venkat Prabhu failed with GOAT, shankar failed with kamal and now Mani Ratnam..... What's the actual reason?   I think I know how coolie movie is going to be now....
