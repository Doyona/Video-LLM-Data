Was it just me or does Steven's dancing remind you of Patrick Swayze. VERY similar body type and steps!!! 😮
I wonder how many pairs of glasses he's going to go through before each performances, tossing his glasses over to the side?
What was their score? This looked so fun!
Am I the only one who misreads his last name as "Nerdososcik"? 🤓
When does the show come on
How is child seeing? I know that on the horse he’s pretty much going on instinct. You Superman!!! Liking and voting for you!! Go team Stephen!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
How is this reality
okay but why was this so good 😭
Is it just me or was that awesome??? They really better do a superman dance at some point. I hope they are securing a proper license.
Dies snyone knoe the titlee of the song?
Is it just me or am I the only one getting flashbacks to Apollo Ohno
my god, he can't see, how does he do it?
Can we talk about the singer in the background at 0:32 just absolutely EATING this moment? 👏
What If Stephen & Rylee Be the Jordan Fisher & Linsey Arnold 2.0
So glad to see him do well! What’s up with the production of the “live studio audience “ audio? Seems like some generic background track. I didn’t get to watch live , is it the same when live? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Honestly between his popularity, Rylees popularity and actually good dancing?! This is theirs to lose and I’m here for it!
What were the scores?
