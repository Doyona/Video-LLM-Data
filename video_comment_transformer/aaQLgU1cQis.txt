Maybe she needs better food?
Who has who trained ?? 😂😂😂
How did you ever figure this out!?😂
How long you think it'll be before the dog calls your bluff?
Gee, i wonder where it got into that habit?
This is so cute and funny😂😂😂😂😂 Do you blame her?
How long did it take her to train you like that?
How did you discover this? Or create it, or whatever?
Why not add a few nummies in her food? Plenty of things that are nutritious for dogs. My dogs get a little bit of wet food in their kibble, pumpkin and blueberries, coconut oil and sometimes raw honey.
Maybe he just wanted water?
Wait!.... There was a dog in the video?
Are you broke,why would you trick your bubba!?
This is too much but I love it 😂😂😂😂 She just wants to included too❤❤❤ I'm wondering if you have to do this each time, she wants to eat? Lol cute dog ❤
Or maybe just get something different, dogs may not like to eat the same old thing
who is worse the dog or you putting in all the effort to fake it
Why is a red empty cup upside down in his feeding area???????
So is this the trick? I never thought I would need to convince a dog to eat, yet I have to instruct her to eat. What gives?
My dog absolutely can tell the difference. One sniff and she looks at me like "are you serious "
Why not make them some simple chicken breast
Cute dog. What's up with the Red Solo cup?
Not telling you what to do …Do you ever put raw or family scraps food in the bowl?  I believe straight kibble is not a great dog fud. My dog gets both raw and cooked as toppings. Such a cute dog
How high should I jump 😧😵‍💫
Why are white folks so obsessed with k9s
I'm wondering how she learned what the dog wanted.
Lol! Why you do that?? 🤣 jokes on you!
Please tell me you don’t just feed her kibble…
Dog's arw already smart but this is idk 🤷‍♀️ evolution G's
Maybe he should be eating more than just dry kibble
is she putting CBD in his food?
Sorry I missed the whole video what was it about? Was I the only one distracted here🤔🙈
Maybe she wants actual food instead of processed dry dog kibble?
What did you put in it, i have a real picky eater, she used to eat dry but stopped, please give recipe.
She's ASKING for fresh-ish dinners!
Who's the silly one 😂😂
Someone spoiled her!😂😂😂 Have you had her since she was a puppy, or is she a rehomed/rescued dog?
Did you actually add anything? Didn’t look like it.
Or you stop the foolishness and let her starve herself until she realizes that there are treats and then there is dinner. Learn the difference.
Vegetables, please?
To be fair: are we really so much different???
How did you get her into this habit . There's obviously a reason why she's like this .She wouldn't do this for nothing
You must have previously done these steps in order to get her programmed this way?
A little vinaigrette and chopped veggies? My former dog knew when he would eat because I chopped carrots and apples into his bowl and he knew when I got the carrots for him, especially (he came around the kitchen checking out the situation). He never thought when I chopped veggies for our meals that he was eating.
Why don’t you feed your dog you claim to love some real food instead of poisoning it with that garbage from a bag.
Just like a kid.   I’d love to know how,how in the world did you end up doing that?
My dog would be like WTF mom? Where's my chicken and rice and still not eat that plain kibble until it was actually mixed in. Fussy lil female pitty of mine but she's so worth it ❤
Why do white people put their dogs tray on their food counter 😂😂
Ask yourself how it started.
What is that she put on the food?
She's so cute and I just want her how much do you want for her
What's the red upside-down cup for?
Who is training who here, exactly?
Reverse Pavlov? ‘Personification’? Where do we begin?😂
Is this really about the dog?
What would we do without them?
Let me guess when you go for a walk with dog, dog runs infront of you and you have hold on to a dear life to that leash?
How is that her fault? You introduced that to her and now she is spoiled… whose fault is it really now??
How do we know you didn't tell her not to eat and that's why she's sitting there waiting for you to give her permission? 🤔
How does this even start? 😂
WHO IS THE BOSS?
Food goes in bowl. Food stays in bowl. Dog don't eat and it's not for some health related problem? Food still stays in the bowl. Dog will eventually eat the ready and waiting food when the hunger becomes actual hunger.
Does she have to drink her water out of that red cup too?😂
What did you put in there after the edit🤔?
I'm curious to know what you Really gave to the dog to make it remember that special meal to where it won't eat until it tastes that again?
And where did she learn these behaviors???  Ey?
wonder how this all started lol
How about real food? Like chiken?
Maybe you should mix some meat with the biscuits. Looks very dry..
Maybe waiting for potential can food?
How do I donate a steak to that baby love dog videos keep going good work love your dog❤❤❤
I wanna know please , why is there a random beer pong red plastic ??
Cook for her? 😊❤
Yeah? Who started the whole process? Hmmm
What’s up with the red cup?
What have you done? 😂
And why don’t you actually add some cut up meat to it ? Imagine eating dry kibble every day!
So you can’t see the dog is asking for meat not just dry biscuits? And you think tricking it is a good thing? Poor dog, give it some decent food, learn to understand it and be a better owner
Instead of going through the motions why dont you actually do something to it. Dry food is a killer.
What's up with the red cup
Was that honey?
What if they know you're not doing anything to it but want you to at least put more of an effort than opening a sack
Where is her water
"Wtf is this Karen? You did all the same things you do when you make people food and it still tastes like dry kibble?"
Why beautiful dog can not have great real/warm cooked meal instead of ball of dog biscuits ?
Funny what is dog name? Cute
😝🤣🤣🤣 I was like, “Wait, what???”
And whos fault do you think that is???
Surely that's just conditioning, the dogs doing it for you if anything the dog interrupted that it's supposed to wait for those noises before it can eat.
Why is my dog like this?
Are you the same way????!!!!
My dog would look at me like "You didn't put nothing in this. Fix it."
Ask yourself how in the world did the DOG   LEARN. this.   You.  trained her then she trained you  Lol.
How do you live with yourself after lying to that poor mistreated pup?!?! LOL
Is he single child? Seems like it.....
Could you make her some steak and potatoes for real? 🙏🏼♥️
Mine does something similar. You gotta wonder how their minds work sometimes.
Why don't you tell us what you are adding?
What the heck are u foing and using?  Lol
Who is more trained the dog or owner
how do u figure out that your dog wants this without TEACHING them this?
I really love how you started this in the first place. Obviously she wouldn't eat one day, but what made you think ill try do this and see if she eats it, or did you once add veg chopping to it or left over and since then she won't eat until you do this thinking she's getting the chopped veg or something? ❤
What is the _Youtube comment_ version of doing this?
Whats the Solo cup for?
Beautiful baby maybe she’s asking for something other then dry food, try putting some fruit and veggies and coconut oil in there she might love it😊😊😊
How did you discover this is what it took ti get her to eat???
I agree with all the comments, but I gotta ask: what’s up with the upside down red Solo cup?
The red cup?
But how did that start 🙄
what are you wearing
This is my dad's dog to the T looks just like her too! Lol do all German Shepard act this way???
well, if you're doing all that anyway...why not actually put a little sauce in there for it, IF you love him/her.
Poor dog give em what he wants real food
Learnt behaviour? Owner before used to do something extra maybe?
How did this routine even come about? 🤔😂
Isn't dining supposed to be performative?
What were you doing the day you did it the first time?  Perhaps someone else treated her to something you didn’t know about? I MUST KNOW!! Is there a sequel request button ? Hello??
What did you add to the bowl?
But why you lying though? lol
Every dog needs a sous chef! Prep that shite til the cows come home and VOILA! Perfection in a bowl. Who's a good doggy? 🐶 🍲
How about putting something like meat in there
The Ranch thou Did U try It with The Ranch ??? 😂😂😂
What was the liquid that you put in her bowl at first?
Could you just add something instead of pretending to reward your best friend
Why did she train the dog to take food like that goof
Where's the LOVE?
You have a doggo Michelín rating too?
There's no water in the bowl? 🤔
Plot twist: dog knows it’s a ruse. Just wants to see how long hooman will pretend it’s real.
Instead of mocking her, how about variety for her?
Mix a little bit more please...
Oh she is so cute!! Have you considered adding any raw food into her diet?
Sorry if i sound ignorant, but I just would like to know why the red solo cup between the water & food? Please don't come for me, i am just curious😅
She wants love added to her kibble, is that too much to ask for?
I wanna know how tf you figured this out. XD
Maybe she just wanted some water in her bowl for the dry biscuits.
Can you give her chicken broth in it once and awhile?
Who's zooming who?
Are they all the same? They just want more attention!
why u not give ur dog better food?
Why pretend chop, why not really chop something healthy into the unhealthy kibble?  How about some water packed no salt sardines for instance?  How about a medium-cooked egg?  How about some chopped parsley and cilantro?  I have so many recipes I could write a book about healthy doggie meals, those suggestions are just the easiest to get started with.
How did it all start though 😅
Imagine its 2am in the morning and you have to feed your dog and you have to do this?
did anyone else notice there's no water in the water bowl?
What is the red cup for?
How did you work out what to “pretend “ to do? Does hehe you put sauce on your food and thinks “yo! Look at her chomp that food up!” Lol
*Whats the significance of the red plastic cup on her food tray?*
Yup... I always ask myself; "what have I done?"  My ABBBD (AM BULLDOG) IS SOO SPOILED AS WELL
You call that food? Just a bowl of dry food.  BFD
what is it? m standard is so fussy and he stomach issues, so .. but he eats real home cooked food. imvegetarian but he is not.
Once they know you eat food that tastes like food, why should they eat dry chunks.....they're part of the pack. The pack shares the eats.
I knew a dog that wouldn't eat his breakfast taco without a tortilla.  If you just put the filling in the bowl, he would look at the bowl and then you with the "where's my tortilla?" face.
u think you fooled the dog ? The dogs are much more clever than humans and thats a fact.
What are you going to do when she finds out?
Cook her food?
Why not feed her some real food then? 😢
Maybe hoping each time the food might taste a little different- imagine eating the same thing every day
Is that strawberries or raspberries in the water
The red cup on the food tray?
😅, what does she think is being added?
Why not just give her some good eggs or some meatballs or something
What’s her @ ?
Where was the meat?
Who is she..
Is it only me or is it the most laziest way to feed your dog. Just open the packet and throw it in a bowl? I add finely chopped boiled eggs and 20gms of meat. Very affordable and healthy for a family member.
How many times did you get drunk or high for that to become the routine? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 it’s a joke everyone please don’t come at me.
It wouldn’t hurt to actually give her some fresh blueberries or bananas in her kibbles?  Haha
Is that olive oil being drizzled over the dog food ?
What dog?  I only saw a beautiful woman
Why don’t you cook some chicken or steak and vegetables with it for her. That’s sad you only feed dry. 😢
Are you the second owner? Maybe the first cooked her food and chopped, sliced stuff for him.
How did the woman find out that this is what the dog wants?
How did you figure out that the dog wanted that? Dog people make up so many scenarios, just leave it alone and watch how quick they’ll eat once they are starving!
Why are you lying?
i often wonder ,of my dogs who actually OWNS WHO?!
Why is the water bowl empty ? Is that another ritual ?
? Who started doing it?   Now she spoiled
Well if you really care and love them you would want them to have the best 🤷‍♀️ wonder if that woman is eating only dry food?
Human, did you know that she goes in the fridge when you all are asleep or out of the house and drinks from the pitcher without her red cup. Lol 😆
Where is her link at ...😊
Instead of waisting time pretending, why dont you actually add some whole food in there for your dog
the dog is playing the longest prank in history! who's playing who
