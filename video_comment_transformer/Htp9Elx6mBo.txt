Can someone point me out where is the kick by Haaland? Please
Is Ederson no longer elite? Playing for a team like City, he doesn't have much to do most matches, and yet he still manages to make more mistakes than you would expect him to, given the circumstances.
Idk how you call for an advantage then call a foul not even 2 seconds later. Questionable refereeing in the second half
Can you bring back shorter highlights?
How is Copenhagens goalkeeper not mentioned. The guy had a man of the match performance and single handedly  denied Halland all game. Underrated and classy goalkeeper 👏
For many of you who watch most of City's game, do you think that Pep uses Haaland correctly? I feel like the not only dont do him justice, but when I am able to watch the game, I feel like Haaland should have more aerial presence or more plays for him since he is so lethal. Am I trippin?
Where is the highlights of the injuries, randomly there is new player on the pitch
Isn’t this the same ref that Madrid didn’t want because of the bias towards other teams besides Madrid? Pep doing work under the table. Once a cheat always a cheat.

Was KdB 1 goal and 2 assists? Too lazy to rewind.
MC was aiming the water bottle near the post? Good job.. p.s never put the water bottle near the post, also it should not be legal?
did debruyne mean to score or it was a lucky one...i think he crossed it ,,,,
why would I ever assume that Man City get a tough draw in the round of 16?
who is watching it now?
So it was DeBruyne and 10 others?
Why did they change the beginning to a women 😐
