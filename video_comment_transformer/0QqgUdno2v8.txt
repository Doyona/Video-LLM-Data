Is somebody in there? Really?
Stupid ass questions he is asking a child “is the car unlocked”???? The kid is smarter than he is!!!
What’s dumb question?? Didn’t the boy tell you his mom is in the car??? Really dude?? What do you mean is somebody there ??? What do you mean is somebody there ???
Is the car unlocked?  Dude
Sees a car in the water before I get in let me ask is somebody in there multiple times before I get in and get wet
Was she saved ????
Great rescue. Did victim hate cops 5 minutes before, as the left teaches people to do?
Why did they blur the mom’s dace but not the boy’s?
anyone talking about how slow the officer was in the first few moments???
is it jusr me or should she not even be allowed to drive fullstop if she suffers from seizures !!
Woman: *clearly screaming* Cop: “is anyone in there?”
Why tf did the cop ask the little boy if the car was unlocked? What a stupid question..! Just go check!!
the kid literally sobbing and screaming to help her mom who is sinking in the car The cop who’s literally looking at the sinking car: “is somebody in there?”
is she ok now? how's the boy? he was so brave. God bless them both and the rescuers.
Where is that officers glass breaker? I always wear mine on my gear to break windows under water...
Who is filming this....?
Omg 😮 does anyone know what happened afterwards
Officer asking all the wrong questions, lil bro crying his eyes out screaming and officer asks “is it unlocked” bruh wtf
I need to know they both ok now
Why the heck that she was even driving if she knew that she had seizure attacks now and then? Really mind-boggling.
Is somebody in there 😂😂😂😂😂 no a ghost drove it off the road 🤦‍♂️
So, what's the follow-up on this, was the mom okay?
the cop was about to ask for his ID
Well what happened????  I'm too involved now!!!
Why was that woman allowed to drive if she can have seizures that result in this at any moment?
Cop: is she there? loading ... is somebody in there? loading ... is the car unlocked? Vid description: Samaritan ...   I'm shocked, how is she still alive after all?
Cops.filming instead running?!?!?!
Why didn't he believe him right away? The kid said seizure, she's in the water/car, she's sunk...why call out? is that procedure? Seconds matter
Imagine being led to a half submerged car with screams coming from it after a child tells you their mum is stuck in a submerged car only to ask Is SoMEboDY IN TheRE rent a fuggin brain my guy
I have a neighbor who is not allowed to drive because she has seizures. I wonder if this was her first seizure.
No way is that Liam from shameless?
Why he asked was anybody else in there when he just told him shes in the water? Why he's taking his time like that
Is somebody in there??  what an idiot
Why he ain’t believe the boy still asking is somebody in there? Hurry up foo !!   ❤GLAD EVERYONE OK❤
i don’t know what’s the dramatics is in this video but i would have done the same thing to help my mom ❤
Poor baby…😢 Is she okay?
Is there someone in there is the car unlocked !?! Boy if that ain’t your job checking I don’t know what is
You were hearing her screaming and you still kept asking if someone was in there
And trying to open door by handle???? Bro
Why was bro asking so much and not doing
Is it just me or is that cop a bozo it took this idiot of a cop all this time just to rescue someone he taking his sweet time
Who decided to film it though? That’s always my problem in believing these videos.
How is she doing?
What a brave child thank God she was saved ....But wait, why are there pictures of this tragedy? How was this rescue filmed even under the water. Was this a cop??
Is somebody in there 😮 after the boy said his mom is in there having a seizure? Unbelievable 😮😮😮
Why is he asking INSTEAD OF VISUALLY CHECKING??the boy was very clear saying she was in there!!
"Is somebody in there?"  *I hear you kid but I don't want to get wet for nothing*   Good and smart son.
I'm sorry but the camera needed to be stable while the the officers tried to retrieve the mother. I saw nothing but blurry water. Did I they rescue the mother? Was she alive?
Having seizures and allowed to drive?  My lord.
Is somebody in there? Really? Damn you're smart
Could the Cop have taken any longer to get moving? Jesus
That cop acted with 0 urgency, wtf was he even doing?
Was that a minion
The cop asking to the car if It was anybody in there after the kids told him they sunk got me real mad bro
The officer cannot swim? Instead he jump in, he asking is anyone there.😮
Bro asking to much questions help the  kid
If this is police officer, why didn't he radio for help?
Woman:👩🏾screams ow my foot, i cant move  Pig:👮‍♀️ is anyone in there?
." Is she in there?.. She cannot answer the question she drowning man! I bet he didn't want his uniform wet.
How can you film in such a moment?
Why was the cop so fkn slow istg 🤬
Bro asking is someone in there like she hears him underwater
how did that even happen
Why on earth was this poor child being videoed at this terrible time of his life?
How it (clearly) ended ?…
This cop is asking if shes in there...🙄 That baby was telling you she is in there and she had a seizure!!
OMG does she have a history of seizures? If so she should not be driving
Why is she driving around with a child, or even at all, having a seizure disorder? wtf.
Is someone in there? Meanwhile kid saying my mama is in there…
What type a question is that? Is she in there?🤦🏽
Is somebody in there? Like bro I swear
Is somebody in there wooow 😂
Was she in my her phone?
What i want to know is,did she survive 😢
I love how they have zero rush to get to her. What are they doing ?!?!?!
That cop should have been moving a lot faster or is that just me
Omg, please tell me that that sweet boy and his momma made it? And if so can we send to them? Would love to help that boy and his momma out.
Couldn't the officer move a little quicker? The boy had to tell him so many times :( even I felt his anxiety 😔
Why are tgey driving knowing they have this problem which can come out anytime?!!
“Is somebody in there?” As the kid is yelling his mama is in there… get a clue, officer
y was this guy filming
The man is just standing there asking is anybody in there after being told there is somebody in there is very distasteful!
This officer needs to show some level of urgency. Dude is asking "is someone in there" when the kid keeps telling him his moms inside.
The cop is slow as a sloth, asking stupid questions. Just go dive into the damn Lake
I wonder how the boy got out if there was no open windows and the doors were locked. Was it just the pressure of the water that made it hard to open? I didn't think it was deep enough for that to happen.
Why is someone filming this.
Is that cop stupid
“ is somebody in there?” Bro literally said his mom was in there like 3 times😂
"Is somebody in there?" Like where, hiding at the bottom of the lake?   Like she's gonna pop out and scare him?  🙄
Whats the  Psyche behind killing your family members?? Why does this seem so normal in America
Poor kid trying tell the cop his mother sin a drowning car but he had to ask “is there anyone in there”
Stupid cop asking if some one is in there  Human can't talk underwater.
Why keep asking the same question about her being in there to the child?! Did he not believe him he was soaking wet himself and clearly he wasn’t the driver
Is the car unlocked.... Maybe we should wait and see if she gets out.
She would have had to been in the water for quite some time! Does anyone Know if she survived?
It’s crazy how the kid is telling him his mom is in there and he’s asking and waiting for a response….. what an idiot
Was that a snake they threw off her?
Asking the car if anyone's in there ain't gonna rescue the drowning victims any faster 🙄
Why is he asking a panicked child a load of questions? Just get out to the car and see for yourself!
"Is somebody in there?" Its like hoping someone just gonna come out from that water😂
Hoefficer over here  asking if someone inside while they underwater. 🤦🏽
Can someone tell me why he still yelled if someone was in the car when he was told there was someone in there? I feel like those could have been precious time wasted but maybe there is something i dont know
Are those question always a requirement before saving someone that is obviously about to die?
Did she survive, and if she did is she well?
That cop doesn’t want to get wet 😅😅 hence ask a ridiculous questions “is somebody in there? 😅😅 and kids repeating “save mom” 🤦‍♂️
No calls to defund the police? How about comments on 'systematic racism'?
Is anybody in there? What the fuck
No one can here is someone in there?.
It really sucks that these video uploaders provide zero context, and zero resolution.  Why do yall subscribe to these idiots?  I mean, they don't even pay their commentors for their work..........? Hello?!?! McFly?!?!?!
How did this story end? How are the boy and the mom?❤
How did this happen?
Why that cop asking the dumb question of is anyone in there?  Obviously that's why the kid crying
What a shitty cop. Instead of rushing to save the person he was already told was in the car he took the time to ask stupid questions.
Jesus he took his sweet time getting to the car didn't he?
Did the mother live? So scary for that poor baby
I like how he casually walks over and asks the obvious question then casually walks into the water while she is inhaling water.  Given the amount of time that was wasted I wonder if she survived at all.
How you going to ask if there's somebody in there twice or somebody beating on the window and then you're going to walk hesitantly up to the car when a child is begging you to take you there cuz his mom's in the car having a seizure
If she is prone to seizures, why was she driving
“Is somebody in there?!” Oh hey yea just knitting a sweater how ya doin?? GO GET HIS MOM WTF
Why does it always take so much effort to make a cop do the right thing ... the boy had to scream to go save her when he was literally in front of the car, watching it drown
Can this officer be any slower and have more questions before he decides to go in the water and help!
Why he was filming and taking his time
How does this even happen? "Save me whyt peepoo, I dun ba mizthake!"
“is somebody in there?” wth kinda question is that
He actually stood there playing 20 Questions to the point the kid had to scream "HELP HER" at which point he continued to slow walk to the car taking his sweet time. Fuck is wrong with people.
Dumb ass cop asking if someone in there after the boy is pleading that his mother is in there…
stop asking questions and get her out every second counts really
And he gets his phone to video it.   Good lord what are we coming too?
Lmao is she in there?? No this was just one big prank officer take us to jail now.
Why didn’t they call for an ambulance?🚑
Can you move any slower?
Is somebody on there???
stop ask the car if somebody is in there when the kid allrdy said to you whats up
Is someone in there nooo it’s just the wind
Why the hell do you post only the beginning of a story and never the whole thing? It drives mr crazy. What's the point?!
Why is he asking if someone’s in there if they would be under water
Why would she drive if she know she's prone to seizures.?
Am I the only one who tears came down?
"Is she in there?" "Is somebody in there?" "Is the car unlocked?" "Does she have her license and her registration?" He is picking every possible dialogue before doing the objective, and this is how you properly play an RPG
Why do people feel the need to record put the phone down so you have two hands!
Don’t people know go twords the part sticking in the air
Takes his time asking questions
Did she survive?
If they couldn't get into the car to get the mom, then how'd he get out?  Poor boy, he was so scared, but he did so good by fighting through the terror to go get help!
The kid says his mom is stuck in the car, and the woman is heard screaming from inside the car, but still he has to ask, "Is somebody in there?"
Okay but why the fuck is the cop wasting all that time asking “is there someone in there” like yeah cause the drowned woman is going to become conscious again just to answer you
“Is somebody in there?” 🙄 broooo she is drowning. She cannot respond
Bro this cop is so slow 😭 "is she in there" NAWWW SHE'S AT HOME "is the car unlocked" PULL THE DAMN HANDLE
Very unsatisfying...couldn't see the victim...is she alive?
“Is there anybody in there?” What kind of question is that bruh he just told you there was like 3 times
Cop wasting time asking if she’s in there.
How did the car end up in the small pound thought it’s not even close to the road ??
Did really had to film? I think it would be faster if he didn't document this moment! What's wrong with you people??
What the hell was she doing driving with a seizure disorder? These guys risked their lives to save her
Doesnt anyone find it strabge that the cop asks " anyone in there" after the boy already told the cop someone was in there! Seems strange to me.
So many questions, these cops will do whatever they can to NOT help
Did she survive? She was in there for awhile
Bruh am i the only one wondering y buddy movin so damn slow. Like glad he saved her but some urgency would be coo big dogg
how long does someone have to be unconscious underwater for them to be un savable even with cpr
Why the fuck is he just walking all slow. Save the fucking women
Is the cop afraid of water or something? Hurry tf up, she's losing brain cells while you fuck around.
How did the boy get out?
Did she survive?
Is someone in there what the hell smh
she’s alive???
The Cop asking is somebody in there sounds funny......dude go check.....
Why the cop so slow at the start even tho the kid went to the water
But why is this boy in the water 💦 like that ? And “is the car unlocked “ huh 🤔?
She was drunk?
😢😮omg is she ok
Asking if someone is in a car that's submerged in water is just baffling like dude really
Surely if she has seizures she's not safe to drive. Thank god her child got her some help.
Why is he moving so damn slow??
Why is she driving,is my question with her medical condition? Someone isn't telling the truth about there medical condition to DMV, or she is driving with a driving license.
Is somebody in there? 🤦🤦
This remands me the "are you chocking???"
What do they mean is someone in there he told him his mom was having a seizure and is drowning
Why did it take the cop so long to get in the water?
Tf is he asking questions for the kid just told em what happened.
Did she survive?  Poor boy 😢. God Bless him for helping save his Mom ❤ & the one who responded & helped♥️
That cop is too slow and asking too many questions.. emergency services my ass.
Why is the cop asking questions get tf in the water
How did she even get a driving license?, lm glad she found help but this could have ended badly if she was to be on the freeway or something
Filming or rescuing??
That friggen COP MAN!! The boy is SOAKED and he’s asking is she in there  -he says she was!-and is it unlocked ? Like RESCUE IS MOM DUDE
Who filming it?
“ is she in there? Is there somebody in there? Is the car unblocked?” no… didn’t you see her in the corner of the video sipping on the margarita sitting on a floaty. Ppl ask some dumb questions in serious situations like this one
Oh damn, poor boy. This must have been so traumatic for him, I wonder if this was something that only happened once
Maybe I missed it but does anyone have the GoFundMe link to this?  Any news updates on Mom’s condition?
Defund the police?! 🚔  defend the blue! 💙 thank God for heroes.
O look white cops helping a black family why isn't This go's viral... I realy hope she is OK  por kid ...
“Is somebody in there?” Seriously, how much stupid are you? And he takes a video.
Should people who have seizures be able to drive?  Why is their driving privilege more important than public safety..? Too many terrible accidents caused by seizures... its preventable
Is she still alive?
Howd he get out though??
If the windows are up, how did the boy get out?
Why did he ask if anyone was in there? 🤷🏽‍♀️
Wow hurry up police officer just walking around asking questions she is dying FFS
Was she ok?
Is this a police camera?
How on earth did she survive that long underwater, with her body out of control???   I lost my breath just waiting for her to be brought out!
Why can’t cat manufactures out in some kind of device that will be alerted if the car is submerged in a certain amount of water that auto-unlocks the damn doors better yet OPENS them just a little so people can at least push there way out of 5 feet of water?!  I understood pressure but many more people go into shallow water like this or into ravines on sides of roads where pressure isn’t a major issue, hm🤔
Is the cop brain dead?
“Is she in there? Is the car unlocked? Is her insurance up to date? Are her tags expired? What’s her favorite color….”
what was he carrying it seemed very small? is she okay now?
That sounded like a White man, Saving a Black Woman, Where is this racism we always hear from people like Joy Reed, Sunny Hoston, Al Sharpton.
Bro, sitting in the back talking about is somebody in there while they said she fainted and she’s having a seizure?😂
There was someone in a bright color shirt already at the door trying to open it……..but not mentioned?
This is sad, but if she is prone to having seizer's, why is she driving? She puts herself in danger and everyone else.
Really, he had to ask, is she in there?  Is somebody in there? The kids had already told him she was having a seizure and was in there. SMH.
Cop was like “but do I really have to help?”
Why was the cop moving so slow at first
Did she live?
What a shame no sense of urgency… asking if the door is unlocked???? WTF , thank God for the Good Samaritan
That police officer was annoyingly hesitant wasn’t he!? Asking sunken people in a car if they’re alright and in there…😮 seconds saves lives!
Did the mom make it??? Just curious about people doing what should be done!!! Seriously, I can’t think of this any other way!!! I would have saved her for certain!!
Why he asking is someone in there is she is there it was not the police officer at all 😢😢 but they job is to what
Is she okay???
My God can the cop move any slower?
Stupid ofcer keeps asking are yoy in there
Im just wondering if his mom should have been driving because sometimes people with seizure disorders are not allowed to drive
*audible screaming and yelling*  Cop: is somebody in there?
Wondrous human drama. Did that punch not work under water?
Did he lock the doors on the way out?🤔
So was she saved?
I hope she’s okay!! Did she live? Her son loves her so much, he kept it together enough to tell the cop. I was not this strong when I was young, amazing for him, I do hope he saved her.
Was she saved??
Did she make it? Anyone know?
Was everyone OK? Good cops are awesome.  Bad cops should take note
Did she live?
Do we know if she made it?
So what the f was he asking that traumatized kid questions for? Like go help.
Okay but where is this cop’s sense of urgency?!?
Thank God he got help for her, but why was she driving if she’s epileptic?
Wonder if she lives dang that was intense y'all show anything
Is she okay now???
Did his mother survive?
This is extremely traumatizing for me to watch. You are leaving us wondering if that women survived for which chances were zero. As somebody who lost their mother in a carcrash I wish you didn't show me this video. What is that giving anybody? Is this about clicks???
Why did you cut it off when you did?
Why was he asking if somebody's in there like what did he expect them to be able to answer while they're underwater? And I heard the voice tell him that she was having a seizure
Whyis she driving with seizure
That poor baby is so scared, hurts my heart.. how is his mama?
Did she definitely survive? I hope that sweet angel isn’t too traumatised and that mama is feeling better xx
the boy just screaming for help and the cop doing stupid question like 😡
Thank God for the officer but uhhhh yeah!!! All those questions bro. Just jump in and act as if it was your mom. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Everyone criticizing this guy, he's asking questions while walking in! Is the car unlocked is ac reasonable question, if it's unlocked the options for entry change. He's asking is somebody in there, we don't know how far away he had to run for help. There's a chance she got out and is either flouting out in the water or on the bank.  if  fear made the kid forget something, time is wasted. Only bad question is one not asked.
Dang that officer asks too many questions like wasting time… but bless his heart for getting her out! Poor baby was so scared for his mama! 😓
Is she alive
Who would be filming instead of helping?
If th child got out then th door he came out of wld of been unlocked????
Is she in there, sounded like he ain't wanna go ! Is the car unlocked wth??? Smdh cop ain't no hero the kid is cop ai t have to swim and he damn near took too long asking stupid questions!
Does anyone know what happened to the mother??
How about promoting these type of videos around election time.
Is somebody in there?? I don’t want to get wet if there isn’t …..smh
Did she live?
Did the mom make it?😢
That baby was brave and got out to get help, do anyone know the final results; I pray she made it.❤️🙏
They got her out but only God knows if there was brain damage. Not enough time for oxygen , especially under water.  Strong brave child.
Does anyone know if she is OK?, the sons' pleads broke my heart 💔 Thank you, @bhumphries1360 for the update,  I pray she'll makes a full recovery 🙏🏼 ❤️ 🥹
Any updates on the mom
Does anyone know  if she survived and doing okay?
Do we know if the mom survived?
Damn, could he have moved any slower?!!! 😡
Who's filming this rescue but not helping?
Is this some type of joke. What they pulled out looks like a snake.
Someone is dying and you're recording video what the hell you're
How did the car end up upside down. ??
Dang.....it seemed like that device took a long time to break window?
He's so brave, is she ok? God bless them both.  Thank God for the office.
Drove me crazy that he asked if someone was in there as the boy just told him his mother was in the car having a seizure
Why dnt they ever show the whole rescue
I thought epileptics weren't allowed to drive ? I'm UK based, so maybe it's different elsewhere.
How did the kid get out of the car?
Is stupid the Police or hándicap.?
Why is a woman with seizures driving with her children in the car?
"Is somebody in there?", "is the car unlocked?"................ the little boy is literally telling him his mom is in there having a seizure.....
One seconds are crucial for survival. Why was he moving so slow appreciate the rescue but it just makes you think
Is She dead?
Why was he recording it?
Is somebody in there ?  Really !!??
why is the cop going 2 mph when (rushing) to an 80% sunken car with a woman inside
The boy and the officer acted fast simple questioning and action 😊
Is he really considered a hero for doing a job he's paid to do??
Grown men/cop pmo ngl cause why you asking if there’s someone in there after being told there’s someone in there😑
I don't understand why the men were moving so slowly?
The cop was doing his job ,the factiry workers just being good humans ...bravery ???? Heros ? I m confused by this .odern age were everyone is a hero by just doing what humans should be doing ..nobodies life was on the line so were is Bravery awards appropriate...i think the child deserves acilaids and big thanx fir sure  to the officer and the gentlemen that helped ...but the rest of the awarded this and that ..let such things stat orivate between a pwrson saved and those who saved them ..we do nt all need media attention and awards ...just my oppinion ,nobody needs to agree or disagree you can have your own oppinions ...
Not taking ANYTHING away from this story - but honestly how/why/who was the camera man here?? Did the little boy find a cop? Bodycam?
How do you drive into a lake in a road like that?
There are sooo many people (men/women) in the world (billions); WHY WOULD YOU SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THIS  TROUBLED MAN?? Geez Jennifer, it's ok to be alone.
Is somebody in here? (×2) wtf??? Like bro the kid obv said that
Did stand there and ask is somebody in there 🤣😂🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Isn't that his job
How in the HELL did bro end up in a lake? Come on mom
Dumbass cop waisting time asking if someone is in the vehicle while the kid is literally screaming his mother is in there
Was she saved?? I don't see that here.
Dramatic?
Why is the cop not showing ANY sense of urgency? Ew!
Is someone in there this kid screaming my moms in there ??
How did they end up in the water?
Jesus, pigs man “is she in there?” how stupid do you have to be?
Stop asking if if someone’s in the car that kid is telling you 100 times I am stressed go
Well, then what’s happening now? Is he adopted or is he? Is he OK? Is he in a safe place?😢
Why he asking dumb as questions 🤔
Please tell me they saved her😢❤
Him asking that dumb ask questions thinking the victim is going to say something under the water and didn’t have pep until someone else was at the car . That was annoying.
Is there an update? Praying for this family. What a brave boy.
I think her son did what any normal child would do given the circumstances. Why does he have be brave to ask strangers for help in an unexpected crisis like this? Is there something not being said? Are the strangers from another planet? We’ve seen animal portrayals do the same in a crisis, asking humans for aid, well not asking, that’s brave. No this wonderful young man should have every expectation of aid.
cop so slow, “is someone in there?” boys coming to you crying, get a clue, wtf, should be ready to give all you can in a moment
Does anyone have news about this mother and son? 🙏🇧🇷
The questions the man asked when he saw a car were just ridiculous and then instead of rushing to the car he took a few much too long seconds to go and check - holding the phone in his hand- of course video first 😔🙅🤦🏾‍♂️🤦it got me annoyed
How he get out of the car but she didn't?
How would the cop hear the mom calling out? Calling for her wasted time. Luckily she’s safe
Was she saved? Poor lad, it must have been terrifying
She's in the water but he asking if someone in there ......wtf you don't understand English
The questions are annoying sir just help
I WONDER HOW THE SON GOT OUT I THINK IT'S HARD TO OPEN A DOOR UNDER WATER LIKE THAT, AND THE WINDOW MUST HAVE BEEN UP SMHH 😮WHAT A BRAVE LITTLE BOY TRYING TO GET HELP TO SAVE HIS MOTHER THANK YOU JESUS ❤
Is she ok?????
Bless that baby!! Now, if momma has seizures, why is she driving?
Is mom alive what happened is everyone ok the cops his urgency was delayed dramatically in my humbled opinion.
Quit asking dumb questions  and go fo it
What a brave little boy!  Was she saved?!!
Is his mom okay 😢
Please did she make it🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Police rush over to car and see if there is a person in car by standing and asking and no action from you at first seems so sad.😢😢
Did the mom survived ?
"Is she in there?"  No shit sherlock!
Did they save her!!!?
Omg is she ok???
Why he just didn't jump in the water and look for the child's mother to save her from drowning? Some people or should I say them people!!!
Really-_- is there somebody in there?
Poor kid. What is someone with epilepsy doing driving a car? With a kid in it?
Why is everyone moving more urgently than the cop whose job it is to actually help??? Bro crying for help and he’s taking his time walking to the car asking if someone’s in there like bro didnt say from the BEGINNING his mom is in there having a seizure…
Is somebody in there?       ..  buuhplblup blup bllhhhlllupp bhhhlluuoop
Cop: is somebody in there   Woman: bubbles bubbles bubbles   I dont understand how the cop can ask ''is there somebody in there'' when he can clearly see the car is almost under water.
Why does the lack of urgency frustrate meeeeee like don’t panic but move quicker seconds matter when saving lives
🧍‍♂️ is somebody in there?
Is someone in there? No bozzo.. they're just fishing 🤨
Is that a snake
Does anyone know the outcome of this accident?
Cop asked if the car is unlocked? WTF
Why wasn't he running to save her? Oh, I see, it's another bystander.. because he dam sho wasn't in a hurry..
Is she in there,is anybody in there?okay just wondering. Like bro! If i saw a vehicle like this am jumping in ASAP
Ok but was she saved?
how the fuvck did they end up in there
Is h asking the child if she is in there is crazy
She is save now?
Was she chasing after them Duke Boy's again?
Is somebody in there what a dumb
A young black man who is in distress and the cop doesn't shoot him? Clearly fake video
It’s annoying that he asked if someone is in the car. He literally told you his mom is in there having a seizure. Every second counts.
Good Samaritan cop? That’s his job?
Man stabbed to death, blood everywhere...  Officer: Sir are you ok, Sir why aren't you answering me?  🤦‍♂️
I don't think I'd be asking if someone is in the car before jumping in after the boy just frantically told me his mother is in there having a seizure.
stupid cop asked is somebody inside omg
This might be a dumb question but im curious; are the body cams waterproof?
Please tell me she made it
Where tf did she get her license from? A fucking cereal box?
Him hesitating asking “is someone in there” pissed me off..if she was incapacitated and couldn’t respond it’d be like, “no?? Nobody?? Okay.. well good news kid she’s not inside 😄”
Did the mom survive???
my guy needs to get a sense of urgency wtf he moving so slow for
Gonna stand there asking if anyone's in there 🤦‍♂️ the kid told you fool!
“Is she in there? Is somebody in there” Dudes he’s been crying out that his mom was stuck in there from the beginning. Thank God for the braveness of everyone and that she was rescued 🙏🏾♥️
God bless this child. Why isn't he on the national news? Why don't we hear about stuff like this?
why was she in the water?
Is she in there?
Poor kid to go through that. I am troubled that he knew what it was. Should she have been driving? Did she epilepsy and how well was it controlled?
"Is the car unlocked?" Sir, who the fuque cares?
Why didn’t the kids try and help?
Good Samaritan?!? That's a cop, doing his duties. Not a "Good Samaritan"
anyone know why the car was in the water
same people same cars, wonder why insurance goes crazy on these :D
The slow approach "Is somebody in there?" is the most stressful thing for me. She's having a seizure and is under water. She can't breathe. How is she supposed to to talk? Rush in there and save her
So am I the only one thinking this cops reaction time was irritating? The kid said she's had a seizure, save her. You see a car in the water, fuckin get in there!!!
How much does that poor kid look like Liam from _"Shameless"_.
Did they save her
Should people that have seizures be allowed to drive?
Was she okay?
Man all those Dumb Questions... 🤔💭Help her!!
Stupid fucking cop, “is somebody in there?” Like, no shit detective! Asking stupid questions like the submerged recently seizures woman is going to him, open her door, and give a thumbs up.
Heartbreaking - boy was so overwhelmed yet strong and determined. How did that boy get out yet all doors were locked?
Having a seizure in the water for that long??.... yeah no sorry, this is fake asf
Could he go any slower?
“Is somebody in there?” “ mom! “ so a drowning person possibly passed out from seizure is suppose to answer you?
I hate how he asked if somebody was in there like dude 😒
Not entirely sure what happened entirely, but where is this cops desperation?
Am I the only one with tears listening to the boy tears and crying out for help?  Glad the officer and the Good Samaritan helped but that officer wasn’t moving fast enough for my liking …, .. I pray the lady is ok and if she has seizures she STAY FROM DRIVING because she could’ve killed herself, her son and anyone else on the road…
The police see and still  ask..ugg
But did she catch a fish?
This shit half underwater and he casually walks up asking if it’s unlocked.    wtf.   Zero sense of urgency
Just keep asking the water if anyone’s in their 😂😂😂😂
Update? Is the ,mother and children doing okay? Regardless child shows good strength in resilience leadership and courage characteristic traits. Hopeful they found the mother in time that they reunited
Gators??
Is the car unlocked? Go find out wtf? Is somebody in there? Yeah dude do you not hear the kid? What planet is this dude on?
Is the officer srsly that slow trying to save a life?
Did she survive ? ❤
Is that Liam from Shameless?
The officer broke the window to save the mother.   What did he use?   It wasn’t a hammer. 😊lease let us know so we are also prepared in the event we come across something like this or even for our own safety from inside the vehicle
Is somebody in there? Nah, the cast just drove itself in the water.
Feeling sad for the boy😢 Also I don't get it, if mom knows she gets seizure, why driving a car in the first place? Poor boy. He have to witness it and will never never forget this incident when he grows up! God bless this family 😢❤❤❤❤
Why is the cop so slow 😡
How tf u pick up a lil boy saying his mom was in there and still ask "is someone in there"   obviously she not gonna fuckin answer
Did this woman make it?
why are we driving with epilepsy?
Is there  a follow up to this story
Are cops good Samaritans by default for doing their job?
Did he pull her out too?? I can't tell who brought her over
I wonder how yall even think about recording, let alone take the device with you and film while  you  rescue someone's life.
Oh my GOD Is she ok ?
Does Amy one know how this turned out? That boy is such a hero, as well as that man who helped them.
When every second counts it pissed me off for him not to automatically react, like if he was scared to get into the water or something.....is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? Really?
The most important question is rather or not this was a meth induced seizure.
Did she survive?😮😢
How is she doing now😮
It’s like he hesitated…hmm why the hell will you ask someone in water a question and expect to get an answer
Poor baby 🥹 Did she make it?
Did he not believe the kid or what?
Why he so slow
who was the good samaritan??? i hope u not saying the cop was a good samaritan!
Why do I feel like he's moving too slow.. I feel that kids desperation 😢❤
How did the kid get out of the car?
why he moving so slow asking is somebody in there did that frantic child seem like he was making sht up to u ida hit that water on my belly and skid across the top getting to that lady every second is oxygen lossdamage
Why tf is she driving
Why was that man ASKING THAT Dumb question? The baby came ran up to him saying save my mama, She’s in the car. She having a seizure. COME ON PEOPLE
Since the boy knew she was having a seizure, does this mean she was knowingly driving a car with a history of seizures? Is it legal to drive?
Is she in there? Is the door unlocked?? Wth! Take action! Ask questions later !
Why is the woman driving if she knows she has seizures…
Is she in there is about the dumbest question
Any update? Was she okay??😢
But why is he this calm as if it's not an emergency wow...
The hesitation to get on the water
What a dumb cop. What type of question is "Is there somebody in there?"
Why did the cop stand around and ask if anyone was in there????
Cops be stupid AF sometimes is she in there is someone in there?! Naa the kid just ran found you and said she having a seizure she sunk she's in the water 😂😂😂 I need to be a cop to see what I do in high stress situations can't be worse than the military.
Water is up to the trunk and cop is asking if anybody is there, like jump the fuck in buddy
Since when are cops samaritans?
Is there a update on the woman's condition...I would like to know if she is ok
All non chalant "is the car unlocked., really dude?
Did they save her?
Him calling hello? Is someone in thr is crazy work
Did she live?
How does everyone have a cam ?
Anybody know if she made it?
The child jumps right into the water trying to get his mom out while the cop stands on the bank asking... is she in there.... yeah such a hero.
Cop a bit too calm there at first.  Questions, questions..." is car unlocked?"   Bruh, kick it into high gear my guy
Good Samaritan?  That's his job.  Samaritans don't get paid.
How could he be so sloww...the cop I mean
Does anyone know how the mama is doing?
Why is the cop getting credit
Por que não tentaram pelo porta malas? Why didn't they try to open the trunk of the car?
Did she survive?
Is the car unlocked? Who would remember that in this situation, much less a child.
Its the dodge
Is that Liam from shameless?
He waited to long, yeah he saved her but why the fuck do you have to ask if somones in their after the first kid came crying, a child wouldent lie while crying like that unless they were coached
Could he move any slower?
Liam from Shameless???
Does the cop still get kudos since he's a evil "white man"?
The boy cries desperately for his mommy but, was he saved himself? God bless him for being brave 😢
Is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? Get your ass in that water and save that black woman.
Why was he walking so slow…?
Do I dare ask how the mom even ended up in a damn lake, or...
I know you gotta stay calm but damn a little urgency wouldn't hurt. Is someone in there? Like the kid didnt run up saying his mom having a seizure and drowning lol he still asks "is someone in there"?
The cop asking if someone was in there with the car under water like Ariel was going to come up and be like yes. Could've been the second between his mother dying and surviving tf. Stupid af
He going to ask if somebody's in there😂😂 ... Bro?!?
Did she survive??????
Does anyone know if she made it?😢
Asking questions like is the car unlocked...stfu and do your job get in and find out
Giving the kid all credit about saving his mom, what about the cop and the other person who did the actual life saving work? Give credit where credit is also due people.
Asking is somebody inthere is insane,just junp in hero,i would have said nothing,just got wet
Did she live?
And How is it dramatic? The child is afraid for his mom??
Is someone in there 👀 depressed 😔 really...kid said it's his mom😢crazy it slow motion
The cop was not on his rescue instinct, the boy already told you his mom had a seizure and she went under water , why the hell are you asking is yhere someone down there as if the mom is going to come up and say yeah its me down here drowning!!!!
The fact that the kid already told him like 3 times his mom was in the water and the cop is still like is someone in there ?
Good Samaritan? He has a duty
Is anyone under there we know you maybe having a seizure and can't respond but are you under there. The level of emergency service usefulness.😂
She either got very lucky or it was divine intervention?  Either way most people that find themselves in that situation don’t live to tell about it
Why this didn’t make shaderoom? lol it’s some good ppl out here !💙
Wym good samaritan cop? Isnt this his job?
How did the child get out? Tge doors are shut!!
Dude why all the questions....Just hurry up and Get in there Deng🙄🙄🙄
She's alive???
Did she survive?😮
The dumbass cop asking "iS Somebody i there ?" 🤡
How can you talk to someone under water.
How did he even get out of the car in the first place!  Such a brave kid! I'm crying 😢
is the car unlocked?
She has seizures but drives? Omg
Im glad she is safe and the child can be relieved but I'm starting to see a trend about people crashing out into bodies of water. What can we do to fix that?
Why the cops move so slow...
Did she survive?
Does anybody know what happened to her and her son ? 😢
The biggest question is.. How in the exact fuck did she end up there ☠️🙏
I wonder why it's called good Samaritan and not good Palestinian.. oh right. Samaria.
Why tf are you asking is somebody in there when the boy already told you it is ?????
Him asking if someone’s In the car  multiple times is stupid.  Did he not hear that little boys desperate cry 🤦🏽‍♂️
He looked all wet as if he was in the car!! so how did he get out?
Is somebody in there? lol
The kid said his mom was in there...and the officer still asked "who's in there"....🤦🏽‍♂️ lots of I.q. points in law enforcement
Cop was slow. Help, not ask so many questions
@fayemcarthur4609 How do you know anything about this were you there?
Oh my how is she??? How is the little boy???😢😢😢😢
Is somebody in there?! MY MOMMA! is the car unlocked? Ffs help her!
So stupid asking questions instead of acting
Is black take your distance go for some donut or something more interesting
What the hell is a good samaritan Cop? There job is to assist. Then yall wonder why people don't rely on cops for nothing!!
Why tf was that cop hesitating to go get her, the child had to get in before doing anything🤦‍♀️
Why does he have to ask if she is in there?
Wtaf that cop seemed to relaxed for someone to be in that situation??!
Why the cop ask annoying question i was like hurry up bro stop wasting time she is dying
10 minutes of desperate cries in the cop ask is somebody in the car...
Good Samaritan? He’s a cop it’s his job not to mention he had zero sense of urgency and wasn’t even the one to get her out.
Why do these people who have seizures drive they should be banned from driving
Having a kid clearly traumatized telling you his mom is in there, and then slowly walking towards the car asking is somebody in there 😂 yeah wtf do you think
Wtf was that cop tapping on the car window? Zero effort to actually break the glass
Did she survive?
Just like a cop. stand on the side and ask stupid questions before going to look. what a dumb a**.
What part of his mom was in there?! 😣
That was a cop who was wasting time asking stupid questions
How's the mom now? Is her boy able to cuddle with her now?
Cop is asking if someone in there and the damn kid is crying telling him to help her
Was his Mama saved? I so hope
Oh is she ok
🎉😢 IS SHE OK DOS SHE SRIVIVE OH GOD BLESS WE ARE SO BLESSED … What a nice courageous young man for springing to action and God blessing him the words to get help … god bless these officers that saved this woman life 😇
How many times did the kid have to TELL HIM SHE WAS IN THE CAR but the cop KEPT ASKING, "IS SHE IN THERE", "IS SOMEBODY IN THERE?"...really??? THE KID WAS SCREAMING FOR HIS LIFE!!!!
I'd love to hear about the rest of this story..does anyone know how mom made out after they got her to hospital?
He‘s not really a Good Samaritan in the classical sense tho is he? He‘s a cop he‘s doing his job. He‘s a good cop that is what he is
Some body known if she is okey??
“Is somebody in there?” My guy we just frantically drove here bc somebody is.
How did the child get out of the car? Doors locked, windows up after?
Cop looked like he was carrying a child!! Where is mom.
Did she make it  My goodness
Why tf did he scream at the car is somebody in there w Hen clearly the car is going underwater ? Everyone knows you couldn’t open a car door under water even if it was unlocked 🤦🏽‍♀️Next. Good job
Is it just me or was this copper a little bit too relaxed
That cop is very stupid, he’s just asking and asking and nothing of action is really frustrating 🤬
It drove me nuts the way the cop stood there and kept asking "is anyone in there?" Like dude, this kid has already told you multiple times that someone is in there! What are you waiting for??
"Is somebody in there?" was crazy. Bro had no urgency. 😐
Was she saved?
But why is she driving a car if she normally have seizures? That’s irresponsible
why does they allow people that have a history of seizure to own a license? I mean you don't allow total blind people to drive so why? This kind of illness can potentially endangered themselves and everyone while driving and having an attack midway.
"...is there somebody in there "...stoopid question
The kids tells the cop my mom in their, and cops said, is someone in there? What a stupid  question.    😂
She's in the car....is somebody in there wtf bro
cop just going for a light swim ? hustle bro wtf
Bro why is he asking if someone is in there? The boy LITERALLY told him that already. What’s with his delay in reaction?💀🤦🏾‍♂️
why's American cops asking all these questions in these types of situations
i feel so bad for the kid i know that feeling but whys she driving if she has seizures
Was the lady ok? I was worried when they blurred her face out! They usually do that when they are deceased!! I hope all that rescue work was worth it!!
Is somebody in there? The boy just said she was! Precious seconds, stupid questions. Just my opinion.
Is this the lil kid that was singing do it again if they look alike
Question !  How the car ended up there ?
Why the cop act so slow?
Did she have a seizure? or did something else happen? It’s an African American driving a dodge charger could have just been speeding and drove into the water
Kid pleas with cop to save his mom in the car. Cop asks if there’s anyone in the car when he gets to it. 🤦‍♀️ like he didn’t wanna get wet or something….. what an idiot in my opinion
Did she survive?
Where was this guy when Ted Kennedy was around?
Slow ass cop asking stupid questions
Cop was casually walking and  asking if anyone in was in  there  without no heavy breathing so it's clear he desperately wanted to help .
Good samaritan? Isn’t this their job to serve and protect?
Cop a Samaritan?  Isn't this, like, his job??? So he is payed for that ??  That's not a samaritan
Why was the cop even asking questions. Like dude just go
He was kind of irritating me when he kept asking was someone in there like he told you that before yall even got to the car 😭
Is there an update 😢😢
Sstupid police, question questions. Is anybody there? He ask the boy told him very loud and clear that his mother is in the water POS
So, how did the kid get out? Hope mom wasn't injured.
Did his mama survive ya al??😢😢
wtf is the cop doing? “Is someone in there?” As the two people are begging for help
Good samaritan cop?Isnt it his fucking job and not an altruistic act ?!
“Is somebody in there?” The kid told you she was buddy. Also, I don’t think she can hear you.
Why tf is he asking the 8 year old questions? You are supposed to exhibit confidence and give the kids a sense of you know what tf your doing. Officer fails here in all ways!
So what happened did they take her to the hospital  or did  she die why doesn't he go in instead of asking all the questions.  DAM IT
The dumbest people wearing badges...sunken car and "is somebody in there...?" 😂😂 reply - "gup-gulp-gulp!
Why is he asking before he goes in  when the kid is obviously upset ?
Does anyone have an update? Did the mom make out ok?
Is there someone in there? Really?
cop so dumb he had to keep asking is somebody in there 😂
I thought legally you aren't allowed to drive if you have any of the seizer conditions
I would love to know the entire story. Were police called, and if so, by who? Or did they just happen to be driving by? Was it truly a seizure? Is she ok? This is an amazing thing, to (potentially) have saved a life.
“Is the door locked?” come on bro
The cop is asking is some one in there and the boy is in the dawn water, yelling help, SMFH!! He helped but he was real slow about it!!
Rescues? He asked the most ridiculous questions before he would act. The kid told him his mom was in there. He then asks "is she in there? Are the doors locked?" GIVE ME A BREAK!
Why did that cop take his sweet ass time though
Seizure diving? How did she get a license? The kid clearly knows his mother is epileptic. So sad
Any de-fund the police lunatics out there?
How do you come in as an officer to serve and protect but think about yourself first is crazy to me .
Is somebody in there😢
How did the police arrive in just enough time to save her ?  Did the kids have a phone or just miracle luck that a officer came by ?
How many times is he  going to ask is  someone in the car when the child said his  mom , I felt like  this took sooo long 😢
What is the update? Is she ok?
How are you gonna see the water moving and ask if someone is in there
Kid: Please save her. Cop: are you sure someone is in there next time more action an less talk
Cop gonna stand there and ask if she in there, like nah dude I’m just wasting my breath
Damn i hate people like this cup, in situation each milliseconds can save lives they asked stupid questions
How’d the kid get out tho?
Did they resuscitate her?! Who edited this?! Dear God what's wrong with you!
someone is there,.? for real,...the boy gets to you,...the boy drives with you, and because its water you ask if someone is in there,...????
Did anyone get to read the true outcome? Or are the comments of being saved, assumptions? I can’t find the rest of the video that’s why I’m asking, to see if she truly made it. I pray 🤲 she did. That boy did all he could. He was all wet from being in the water too. 😢
Is the car unlocked?😮
Teach your kids to swim,to read,to write,speak correct english,respect each other,what do yall do with these kids,smfh
"Is somebody in there?" Dumb question when the boy already said so. What a waste of time and a lack of swift action.
Where is this cop’s sense of urgency? Seconds count.
Whay?police use like 15min befor going in or runn to safe them😂😂😂come on crazy
U guys sure momma survived? She was under water for a good while it looks like
I've never understood  why people  have to ask so many times what's going on while standing  there  like get out there and ask WHILE DOING SOMETHING
Did she live?
Is anyone in there?  Is the car unlocked? That kid was way more competent than the cop...at least they helped. 🤦‍♂️
Jeez, sense of urgency?
iS sOmEoNe In tHeRe? I don't know man, maybe someone just parked their car underwater
Is the car unlocked? Has it been waxed lately?😮
Was she saved? Was she alive?
Is the car unlocked? Is someone in there? Bro he’s going crazy telling you his mom is in there run in there and get her out not the time to ask questions my boy
where is the fire department?
Can't believe some people in the comments are saying he's racist because he asked the question multiple times, oh the state of some poeple 😂
Eigther, the officer had no urgency or was I too anxious 😢
there's a reason cop asked, to know weather she's still in the car or she sunk down in the pond. many are too narrow minded to think of that and just jump into conclusions.
The stupiest question in this Situation. The policeofficer is an idiot, maybe?
Why the f the cops waste so much time calling if somebody in there? Is it some kind of protocol or something?
How did the kid get out of car ?
Did dude really ask if somebody was in there???
Did he have to ask that dumb question tho?
I hate people that repeatedly ask ANSWERED QUESTIONS 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️it’s even worst in dire situations
Boy screaming her mom is in the car and he still asks the car if there's anyone there.
Why is he recording?
Wasting time asking if someone is in there!!! You see a car in The water! Her kid is crying telling you the story!!! It's not like the victim can reply! Act NOW ask later!!!!
Smaritan cop? Or their job
What was the cameraman doing !????
Hmmm y'all really be falling for scams
The cops were asking if theres anyone in the car so they could charge the kid with underage driving 😂
Why where they so chill in the beginning
WHY is someone with seizures ALLOWED To DRIVE?   That is so wrong.
Why's she driving if she has seizures?
Is somebody in there wtf kind of a stupid question is that, the kid told him that his mother was in there and that she had a seizure how the ffff is she gonna reply
“Is she in there?” Like he didn’t want to get wet unless he had to. 🫤Texas is flat land in the middle of nowhere, and we all know how they are so it’s now she’s be knocking on random doors if she did.
Good ending but holding the dam camera could've cost her life, and does lil dude want it in his face in the scariest moment of his life?
Did she make it? Shouldnt be driving with siezues, great work saving mom!❤
Why the fuckdid he ask if somebody was in there.
And the police.. is some one in there?? Maybebif he saw bubbles coming out 😠 😡
What do you mean is somebody in there??? Lmfao why are you guys praising a lazy ass cop that clearly stood still for 10 seconds and asking if someone is in a car under water 💀💀💀
How traumatizing that must’ve been for the child 😢 is she ok?
What happened? Why half video? Is she ok or she died?
Why is she driving if she is prone to seizures?
Th cop was being dumb if you're having a seizure you can't respond and he gonna ask is anybody in there after the kid said his mom was in there having a seizure
Is somebody in there? Helloo?? Anyone heerrre??
What is the name of the movie?
I am glad that she was rescued,  but was this her 1st seizure ever?  Because if she had them before, why was she driving? I have a friend who has epilepsy. Although she did not have a seizure for over a year, she is still not allowed to drive and will never will be. It is too dangerous.
Why do they hire the dumbest people to be cops?
What happened were they able to save her
Is someone in there what a stupid question when the kid is screaming his mom is in there
why did it take a minute for a cop to go in there?
Is she in there is the car unlocked stupid questions should've broke the window
Why are you posting some like this for views?
Is it just me or was the officer moving to slowly when every millisecond counted
Why was the cop going so slow?
Is somebody in there? …. Man!!! He told you his MOM was there!!! 🙄🙄🙄slow as F!
ASKING THEM ... DUMM ASS QUESTIONS😐
How did the woman end up in the water? How did the kid get out but mother could not
Who would have a camera ready for an emergency like that??  I hope she is okay!! 😮
The dumb ass cop standing there eating precious time “is anyone in there” while the boy just told you she was having a seizure?!?!?!
WTF is he so slow?!
Why this police moving at a turtle pace? Geez!
Is thus froma movie or it is for real
Could the cop be any slower
Useless cop dammit!!! 🤬 So exasperating “🤡 is someone in there?” When she had a seizure and is underwater 🤦🏻‍♀️
This guy moving so slow asking questions
Why did he scream are you in there?? The son said she was in there, crazy
Dumb ? Is somebody in there?  Is the car unlocked? Just get there and get her out. That boy just broke my heart
I am happy they rescued her but curious question I thought people who have seizures werent able to drive?
I'm so glad that she's going to be ok. But does she have epilepsy? People with epilepsy shouldn't drive at all.
why is he dilly dallying while there is literally a car under water and a boy is screaming that his mom is inside💀
Anyone know if the mom made it?
Could he react a little more slower
Help gurgle gurgle.....is somebody in thurr?
Why is the cop walking up asking if someone's inside?? You got directed there for a reason
Cops asking the kid a million questions what’s her astrological sign?
why do they issue licenses to epileptics? very sad
Why the American police ask so many questions before they actually go out for help????
Did they get her. I hate short younnever get the end .
Bro asks if anyone is in the car like anyone in a submerged vehicle is going to answer
Is the car unlocked? Cuz maybe I need to clock out of my shift if it isnt.
You had to ask again when you got there did you really think it was a set up Jesus?
"Is anyone in there?" Really?
Whyyyyyy would he ask if some is in there ????? Yes dude ... His momma is
Did this person ask is  somebody in there? And the second question is worse..is the car unlock? Wtf what's next? Are you dead?
Did she live???
Were calling cops doing their job good samaritans now? Didn't have any sense of urgency in the beginning either.
I wanna know if the lady was ok !!
Why did it take the cop so long
She looked pretty dead to me?
Gators??😮
Why does he ask twice, if somebody was in there! Just go help! Lost important seconds there!
Bless his heart. Did his mom make it? So traggic and tramatic.
And he asked....is the car unlocked.... totally don't like this 😮😮
Christ Almighty, don't play 20 questions, GET IN THERE.
How many people thought of iRobot?
why TF is he shouting is someone in there? he already told him there was. u think shes gonna shout underwater??? Hes wasting time!
Damn that cop is wasting time asking stupid questions.
If she has  seizures why the hell is she driving?
Could the cop have moved any slower?
Asking dumbass questions as seconds tick by. Smh
Idiot cop asking if someone's in there? WTF
Is someone in there? She underwater bro and she sure ain't aquaman.
Are the doors locked......really?  Try it.
By seeing all this he is asking "IS SOMEBODY IN THERE"😢
“Is somebody in there?” Is he hard of hearing? The boy told him a few times his mom was in the water 🤦‍♀️
Taking his sweet ass time, act ask questions later
This officer needs more training tf he asking if the door is unlock ? And after being told that his mom is in there he still ask if there somebody in there 😂 he need more awareness
Seizure and in the water? Survival seems very low.
could that cop move any slower and any more nonchallant????
Omg omg omg was she alive ? I hope he didn’t lose his mother
Is somebody in there? Naw what do you think, sir?🙄
The policeman is asking which question just do your job help out and you find out who is inside hello
The cop wasting time asking if there is somebody in there as if a person under water can speak.
anybody know if his mom was saved
How can someone prone to seizures be allowed to drive
Did she live?
Wow so many questions ,, instead of checking right away.
Is it just me or was the officer moving ina very non urgent way in the first half ..
Could he have reacted any slower at first. Geeze.
Did they save her? Bless that boy ❤
“Is somebody in there?” I’m stunned
Who the cop be any slower
Dafuq do you mean "good samaritan" cop? That's his job...
“Is she in there”, is somebody in there”, what kind of idiotic questions are those? The boy said she was in the car having a seizure & the cop wasted too much time before helping. 😡
Is someone in there? Like dayum he already tokd you.. and why is the cop so chilled like dayummm hurry up and save em
Why do people with seizure issues drive cars?  that should not be!
So… I have a question. Does she have a known seizure history? If so, she probably isn’t supposed to have her license. Depending on the situation. Because of reasons like this.  I’m glad everyone is ok.
Asking if "somebody's in there" while they're inside a car drowning is crazy 😂
Why is police taking his sweet time?
Dude the cop should have just jumped in, bro was asking 21 questions
again, defund who?!
Asking if someone is in there AFTER this child is telling you it is … is BEYOND ME
Cops just standing there “is someone in there?” Bro did the screaming kid not just tell you his mom was trapped ??
Is this not the laziest slowest reacting cop on the planet ? It’s like why must you ask if someone’s in there or not ? Afraid to get your dooky wet huh shame I hope she’s ok since every second counts in times like these
Cop: is somebody in there?
“Is anyone in there?” The front of the car is submerged and the kid said his moms in there and was seizing….why are we wasting time?
it made me so anxious that he kept asking "is someone in there" after the boy told him ALREADY the situation
'Is somebody in there?' What a silly question.
What’s wrong is the officer is asking dum question at the moment when they need help wet another job
So why does videos like this not go viral like the ones that try to make our police look bad? Most law enforcement are amazing brave people who protect and serve. There are a few bad ones and they just need to be weeded out. I pray that people stop thinking all police are bad, because they are needed. Without them we would have lawlessness.
Could we move any slower. 😢
Who was shooting the video?
Why the fuck did the cop wait so long. The kid clearly told you his mom was in there having a seizure.
Not sure why officers don't carry tow gear, a strap would have stopped it from sinking and depending on officers vehicle might actually pull it out, they used to back home in GA in the crown vics and cherokees,  anyway glad they were saved, human life of all kinds is precious ❤
They stopped without telling us if she was ok?
Howd she get a license if shes epileptic?
The kid started prying before the cop….
Too many fucking questions. Help for Christs sake.
Why...is there...a recording going on in this session/circumstance... Just help that's all that's needed and required
Am I the only one who thinks the cop was way too laid back and slow to act? The good Samaritan was giving his all
I wonder if she was epileptic. He said that she is having a seizure.
Why is she driving as she has seizures?
Jesus Christ cop was asking all these freaking questions get in there and save her
was the cop a special student in school or what..?
Is somebody in there??? Тхат цоп ис думб.
How did he get out but the doors are locked?
Your first question is "is there someone in there"? If I seen a car in the water and a kids desperate pleas I would be diving in that water fast af
How did the kid get out of the car ..
Can the cop move any slower
How tf did she get in there 😅😅😅 happy it all worked out
Sounds like she’s had seizures before? He seemed familiar with this happening to her.
Why it took the cop so long to get in the water is beyond me
Is the car unlocked? ….
Why do they never fucking put the end of the video !
Could this guy move any slower 😢
Cop was asking dumb questions is someone in there ? Wtf do you think ?
Tell me she is alive please
Why is he slow 😭
Could that cop move any slower?
The cops asking if somebody in there 🤔
The man on the passenger side saved her weather he was a cop or not idk
I want to know what took him so long to get in the water
Why was he asking if someone was in there initially and not running to see?  He needed more sense of urgency to check in the beginning.  Was he asking someone else who was standing there?
Is the car unlocked? It’s submerged. Doesn’t really matter.
Dude moving that slow as the car in the water like wtf
Is someone in there? How does he expect to get an answer?
Like wtf is he asking repeatedly is anybody in there when the hysterical child has ran you down and informed you his mom was in need of help, tf 🤨😩🙄
Why’s the cop Reacting so slow
Where Is more video ?
Why did the cop act soooo relaxed? Hurry man someone is under water 😭
Where’s his dad at?
Why does she have a license if she has seizures that’s dangerous
The cop needs training with stupid question is that a car, hum, is it in the water, humhum, is she in there, hum, have you tried getting her out humhum, what is her name, humhum
How did the boy get out though?
Is the doors unlocked bro wtf kinda dumb question is that
Could he walk any slower
Now how is somebody trapped under water supposed to answer when asked "is somebody there"?
What I don't understand is that if a black person come and ask a policeman for help you got the damn nerve to ask questions and and ask the car that's upside down is there anybody in the water if it was a white person or even thought it was a different color your ass would have jumped in already stop being stupid and help
I can't imagine how stupid you'd have to be to come upon that scene and ask the stupidest question, TWICE! I know they only hire morons to be cops today, but Jesus Christ that was dumb.
Asking a bunch of dumb questions!
Why is she driving if she has epilepsi 😔
Boy said she had a seizure and shes stuck in the water "Is she in there? Is somebody in there?" before  even walking towards the water made my blood BOIL!!!!!!!😡 Hope she's okay
The guys asking if someone is in there as if he would get a response is mind boggling. I pray she makes a full recovery. ❤️‍🩹
How that happened??
Tf is up with the cop?
I hate to think that if this was an ongoing sickness and knew better than to drive…or was 1st seizure  and didn’t know his could happen ???
Who was filming this AND NOT HELPING????
This baby! Is there a way to donate?!
Damn i see sometimes they break the glass in three seconds what was he waiting for? 😢
Cop rescues woman? I saw the cop standing around wasting time like he worked in Uvalde, while the kid rushed to the water to get her out.   Fuck this cop.
Is somebody in there!? No shit, someone’s in there 🙄. What kind of stupid ass question is that and why the hesitation?
How’d the kids get out?
Slow moving cop. “Is she in there”? Sir, did they kid not already establish that? Cops sure love harassing you with questions, but have never actually been good at the listening part.
Am I the only one freaking enraged that he’s not moving faster like like what are you doing help
So did the slow walking cop get back out of the water?? Because I see another man breaking the window and carries her out????
How do you know she survived . The time the cops arrived and the time they took to rescue her mama was a hell of a time.
Where's all the "cops are waycisms" comments now?
“Is somebody in there?” Was the dumbest question
Poor little guy his desperate panic is contagiously heartbreaking I woulda done all I could to help him… I hope his mama is ok now???
If she has seizures why tf is she driving?
Is she in there? Wow
And that so called good samaritan took him time dragging his feet, asking if the doors were locked instead of rushing and diving into the water with the same kind of urgency that the young boy had 🚮
They allow people that have seizures drive??
How lazy and cowardly do you have to be to see a car in the water and before you go in to save someone you have to ask “is anyone out there” as if they can speak mermaid underwater.
Hmm just me or the cop was to calm no sense of urgency?
How lazy of a police officer and cowardly do you have to be to see a car in the water and before you go in and save someone you have to ask “is anyone out there” as if they can speak mermaid underwater.
Too many questions at emergency situations . Just go ahead and help her out . 🙄👎🏻
Why did that cop take so long to get in the water? Even if she had gotten out before he got there and she was somewhere else, he didn't know that. The kid screamed she's in there, and that good Samaritan should not have been the first into the water
What's with the camera- in this situation?
Why are you recording and you sound so calm
He asking if anyone in there lien they responded
Why is he just standing there yelling “is someone in there” instead of going right in to help
Whats with the stupid questions ? Just go and help her
wtf was he doing standing there asking “is there anyone in there?”
Is the car unlocked? 🤔
Anyone in there? Gurrrrgle gurgle. What?
Why would you ask if there's somebody in there when the kid is screaming save my mom.  Like wtf.     Sad by
Yo, is that Liam from shameless?
Wheres the dad? 😂
The kid is literally screaming to help her and dude is asking is anybody in there 😂 like wtf!!!
This was the worst rescue I've ever seen  Stupid cop asking the kid is the car unlocked. He was acting like he didn't want to get wet. 😅
“Is somebody in there?” Nah we just threw a car in there and sent a really good child actor to get you so we can prank you into wetting your pants….. appreciate the rescue but time is ticking man!!!!
Is that poor Charger okay🥹
Wonder what caused her to have a seizure hopefully she received the right help in time  it was lucky the boy was able to safely get out  and alert someone
I wanna know how is he brave when that's his job to risk his life but will cry officer safety after he shoots or beats up someone
Dang that cop should stop with the stupid questions and get to the car! Is someone in there? Is the car unlocked? Shut up and get in there and do the job u r paid very well to do! Poor kid dealing with that!
I wonder if the policeman would have hesitated and questioned again and again if there was someone there if the obviously distressed and terrified kids would have been white.
That cop askin all them damn questions
Is somebody in there😂😂😂
The kid is screaming desperately that somebody is in there...and the cop keeps asking 'Is there somebody in there?' Bloody hell...🤦🏻‍♀️
Why don't show if she alive or not😮
Why are cars so hard to get open in water ?
Is she in there? No the kids lying you dummy. Just hurry tf up
Anyone have an update??
Stop asking questions and save the woman
Aren’t you meant to break the back window and climb through there?
For 1 second i want to thump the police officer for asking stupid questions. Oh my goodness what a sweet soul!!! God bless that sugar pie for saving his mom ❤❤.
How did the kid get out of the car?
Dear Lord tell me she is alive please poor baby 😢 hurts my heart to see him desperately asking for help for his momma
That officer doesn't move with any intentions unless it involves a fuggin donut... wtf took dude so long to act?
Why is the cop in slow motion?
Is she ok ?
I am wondering how does he get out of that car😢 in order to look for help?
Is someone in there? I just ran out of breath get in their and save my momma I tried !! I can’t !!! The fear and hurt in that little man’s eyes 😢😢
Godsh,tje kid is telling him that hi's mom is in the car and police oficer stil asking if she' in there,COMO ON OFFICER REALLY????😢
Who was taking the pictures under the water. 😮
🤠is the car unlock ? 😏 Really 😢🤨😵🤯?
How you mean if she is in there? How you if someone is in there ?  🤨
Does anyone know how they are doing? Praying all is well🙏🏾❤️
Why everyone is over looking the samaritan that is helping. He is the tru hero. This wasnt his job or his mom. He just seen someone needed help, stepped up, And carried her out the car.
Moving too slow if you ask me.
Why is he moving so slow to act
He's such a good child. How did he get out?
Why are all police slow as fuck in such situations…. All of them
Did the woman survive this 😢?
He asking someone whos distraught  to many  questions.
Wonder why people who are prone to seizures are driving?
That cop asking an awful lot of questions and moving awfully slow for someone trapped in a car in water and she's supposedly having a seizure
Did the cop move at all ridiculously slow speed for someone trapped in a sunken car?
Why would you video this while trying to save some ones life?
Why do police officers have the overwhelming fascination with useless questioning? “Is someone in there”? Yea his mom dumbass , he told u…. “ Is the door unlocked” ? Bruh just try to open it 🤦🏽‍♂️
Is she alright
Did they get her out? Is she ok?? Anybody know? This raised my blood pressure
How come people with seizures are allowed to drive in USA? It this real?
Cops get me so tight....help my mom is in there, my mom is having a seizure.. pointing to the car already in the water...n the cop asking if she's in there🫤
Stop asking and just go in
the kid literally came over to the cop distressed and yet this cop is asking dumb ass questions before approaching the situation
Dude asked if the car was open? How does he figure the boy got out?  If she had been white he would have been in that water without asking dumb questions.
Tf was the point of the question... obviously someone is in there
Is she in there? Bro that lil boy ain't crying for no reason, get ur ass in the firefight.
Stop asking questions and move for fucks sake
Now that was slow response why ask is she in there is somebody in there? She could have died
good samaritan? isn't that his job? he seemed pretty skeptical when the kid was talking.
I am really curious why people who experience seizures be let them drive on their own by family? There is a case here in our country driving motorcycle and experienced seizure, struck the grilling around the fountain and hit it on top, eye first and skewed through the head.. it is so dangerous please don’t let them drive alone without someone beside them who can handle the wheels
Damn, when a child gets to a window of a submerged car faster than a police officer…..  🤔 something doesn’t seem right. Was there another officer next to the kid at the window? The video isn’t clear.
The fact the they asked is someone in there 2 times before anything has me wondering if they even know what a seizure is
Where was the sense of fucking urgency SMH
Stupid cop... "is someone in there" "is the car unlocked" 2 stupid questions to ask a distraught kid who's already just cried to u his mum is in the car
How do we know she lived ? I don’t see that in the vidoe
Like how is it dramatic
Lol why did he ask if someone is in there? The boy told you his mama is in there.
Is she alive??
Where is the go fund me for this young man?
What happened in the last 3 mins he got out of the car ? Swam out of the lake and got help ? How old is he . This is beyond bravery.
Was the cop asking the pond if someone was in the car? Wtf
i would just like to know how one got themselves in that situation
Did she survive????
Was that officer white?
“Is she in there?”  Bro don’t ask stupid questions, get out there NOW!!  You dope
Is somebody in there??? glug glug.
And he was recording.. why?
Stop asking stupid questions and do something!!!!!!
Jesus, could you move any slower????
Good Samaritan?! Isn't Cops duty to help & protect people?!
Is the car insured.. did your mom pay road tax.. is the car legal to be in the road.. is the check engine light on.. are the tyres legal.. all the while moms drowning hes asking dumbass questions
If the woman was having a seizure why the heck was she driving a car? Ppl that are prone to seizure are forbidden to drive.. 😢😢
Although I applaud the cop’s actions, asking if someone was in the car, seeing that the front end was submerged was just dumb!  Come on, now!  Fortunately, he believed the child, but geesh!
Are epileptics allowed to drive in the US?
Why the hell was the minor’s face not blurred, but the adults was? 😅
Why do people that know they have seizures and people who care drive in the first place glad she's OK hopefully
The woman is alive?😢🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
What happened to these people?
I'm just curious about the odd questions before getting into the water.... didn't appear to be much haste ... but hey....
What topk so long
Is she safe ???🙏🙏🙏🙏
Is somebody there 😳
I’m sorry, but wasting time asking “Is somebody in there?” is literally the stupidest f^cking thing ever.
Does anyone know if she made recovery? A seizure while drowning doesn’t sound optimal.
Glad she’s safe but how did she end up in there?
Is there a follow up.. what happened?
Omg what happened that caused this terrible incident poor child and his mom hope she alright
why the questions????
Did she survive?????? 😢
"Is someone in there?" Asking a question at the wrong time. Quit stalling and hurry up was all I was thinking.
Who's taking the video!!!!
This cop wasn't very fast.. Is she in there? Is the car unlocked?  WTF move!!
The cop is literally asking if theres somebody in there when that boy is literally crying that the mother is in there. That cop would just watch it happen etc. He just went in later, not giving a fck if the person is still alive(he didnt even did it quick like NORMAL GOOD cops would do...
Did she just drive in there
If a kid say someone sinking why tf is the cop still asking for reassurance?
Why did the car fall into the lake?
😮.. . Is somebody in there???  That is a strange question to ask a drowning victim 🤔
I was wondering the police  self camera was working well under the water thanks for the design
The 1st question is, can you answering somebody in the water? Blurp...blup....blup...blup....  🤦🤦🤦
Is somebody in there?? The kid just told u his momma was in there fuckin christ sake.
Dramatic?
"good samaritan cop" aren't they supposed to help? Do they suddenly become "good samaritans" when they're not beating up people ?
@bhuphries1360 how did u find the video must of been hard thank god she was ok
How the hell did she drive into the water.
How did the boy know it was a seizure? Does she have them regularly? Should she be allowed to drive? She nearly killed both of them.
"Is somebody in there?" Really?
Is she ok??
......anyone annoyed of the dilly dally ?
Tf he take so long for*?
Why the cop is so chilled
Another Covid vaccine victim?
The question is somebody in there is Just time wasting.
Gators in that water?????????
Could they move any slower.
Is there somebody in there.. i dont think dude has sense of urgency bone in him..   Its like if i dont gotta get wet i aint goin in.. ferrrekkk!!
Why the usa ppl are so damp , the car is under the water and he asking if there any one and walking slow , gooo help them man
Stupid cop asking if someone is in there when the son is telling him his Mom is having a seizure. It looks like the cop wanted her to die in the water.
How tf can u hear sumbody that’s n the water😠😠😠
does anyone know if she made it or not? They got her out yes but she didn't look alive? hope she made it
Good Samaritan or a cop?  U could tell he didn’t want to go in that water
Why not try access via the trunk. Most cars allow that.
Now, why didn't a blank when the officer got there? He didn't jump in the water and go straight into it. And so they're going to always anybody in New York? And because number one, if you're knocked out you're not gonna say anything, you're gonna travel for anybody to get out if I was at officer, I would already be in that word about prison, without wasting video taxpayers, money LOL.
Why are licenses given to people who have seizures? It’s not the first time I’ve seen this. DMVs and state governors are fully liable
How is this family doing after the incident 😢
Is she in there? Is somebody in there? Every second counts big boy jump in!!!
WHAT A STUPID QUESTION THE CAR IN ON LUCK HELLOOOOOOOO MR👎👎👎👎🤮🤮
Why is he yelling is somebody in there like they gonna hear or yell back in the water.
Maybe instrad of holding the camera to show how nig hero you are use noth hands and brain to actually help!! Why everything must be recorded these dats!???
Loki cop burnt me up asking is anyone in there, of course it is that person aint out there looking for car insurance.. cop moving slow af, like dam wut if that was his mom.. but glad they got her out❤
I hope she’s ok? Seems these videos never post updates.
Why did it take the guy so long???
Could he be any fucking slower ?
No disrespect and I'm not trying to be mean but how did she fit in the water😅😊
Anybody know how she ended up in a lake 😢😮
None of you big Texans have cables on you, to pull her car out?!
God bless that child !  So what happened people Just upload anything and leave an  inconclusive story ???
Lazy cop asking if someone is in there... you should be jumping into the water right then!!!!
Why was that cop so slow.
A real hero wouldn't have stood there and asked questions right after the kid just told him what happened
People screaming help her and he's like is there someone in there is the door locked wow
Painful to see the poor child asking for help…
Why didnt he just save her why did he run off lol
I’m outraged that the officer had the audacity to casually ask   Is she in there?  Is somebody in there?
Is somebody in there? Tf yes you hear uim screaming mom....and going super slow at that
That cop took his sweet time asking is she in there? In somebody in there? He knew damm well she was in there just dint wanna get wet.
Is that Liam from Shameless
How did it finish ? Was she saved ?
Good Samaritan?? He took his sweet time..
How tf does that even happen tho 😂
Take your sweet time why dont you
Not a hero - why did he hesitate and waste time?
🥺🙏🏾❤is she alright?
Did she survive? 😮😢😢
Is she in there? No shit wtf do you think the people in the water are trying to do?
I wish i knew what happened after.
Is she in there lol nah lil homie was drivin😂
Did Mama make it, Praying she gets well
The frustration watching him question “is she in there?” When seconds could count. He was already briefed by the kid that she’s stuck in a car underwater. Why did he have to go back for a window punch, such arrogance that they presumed the child was lying and hesitation when seconds count.
How she end up in the water ?
It toke them that long to break the glass? They pull you out the car for a traffic stop they break it in seconds 😂😂😂
@bhumphries1360 you are awesome for finding out but is there a fund set uo so we can send them money? If she has been in ICU you know they need it and that sweet boy has been waiting by her side the whole time.  Please tellus how to send money!!!
Is somebody in there?? What an idiot
Did she live??????
Plus he asks if she is in there because the son said she is in the water so he has to no the facts he dont no if she is out of the car or in the car but gets the info and helps save her ❤ thanks to her son the guy on scene and the cop ❤
What happened omg how can you just leave a video like this….that poor baby 😢
Seizure did that ? Why the f she driving a 500hp engine? 💀
I know the cop was trying to go by the book or his training. But asking if someone’s in there when her son is crying and pleading that his moms in there means she’s in there
OK he was asking too many unnecessary questions
Yes I'm one of those people that wondered if this lady survived.Thanks so much for the update.
Was she saved.?
could that cop move any slower 🙄
The child is literally crying to save her n this 🥷 over here “is there someone in there?” Bro turn in your badge after you get backup 💀
The cop 🤦‍♂️ asking silly questions wasting time! Is anybody in there? Duh dufus the kid just told you they need help
Omg! I hope she is ok? It is not safe for her to drive.
Cop is asking too many questions
I wonder what happened heart attack I hate to assume it's an OD
Why would u drive knowing you could have a seizure...dangerous for everyone
What the hell is the cop doing asking if someone's in there can he not swim wtf is wrong with this guy
Where is the damn conclusion? I hate these freaking idiots that publish half a story!
O course she's in there, who do you think drove the car, get her out and stop answering question. 😢
Cop asking way too many questions in a live or die situation.
I know ppl who have seizures and passed away while driving. Should ppl who have seizures be able to have a driver's license?
Is the car unlocked? I have a punch
I seriously don't understand people who just sit in the car and do nothing to save themselves??
Why is this cop taking his time instead of running to the car and helping
Why tf he asking if someones in there. The boy said his mother is in the car!
Cop asking is anyone in there when the boy already told you his mama's in there seems idiotic
I’m glad she’s okay but how the hell….?
You can hear her when he walks up & asks twice, is someone in here?
“Is she in there? Is somebody in there?” After being told multiple times by people begging you for help, then he moved with no urgency. Come on.
The guy asking if somebodys in the car. Wouldve thought the kid freaking out gave it away. Glad dude was rhere and willing to help though!
Is somebody in there? Don’t you get paid 100k a year to check?
Did they get her out
That cop didn’t seem interested in the least, I almost jumped from my chair when the kid started going off, how did the cop not feel any urgency
If the child got out why couldn’t they get HER out?
The way the cop asked were the doors unlocked was unsettling ngl
Is someone in there??? Really bro??
"Is somebody in there?" What the hell? They don't ask this many questions after they shoot somebody, so why this many before taking action to save somebody?
Now what you all think of COPS? you like them you get help.
Irresponsible to post this, leaving everyone guessing.
She didn't make it, cop eas too stupid and slow, asking too many questions and not using his brain
Who is videotaping this while this emergency is going on why aren’t they helping?
Still wanna defund the police?
Where's the racism????
Where is he?
Was she okay?
Could that cop go any fuckin slower? Where's the sense on urgency? Like yes, you still helped but damn
If that was his mother he would not be asking if its unlocked and walking slow, " HE WOULD HAVE TOOK OFF RUNNING AND JUMPED RIGHT IN THAT WATER AND RIPPED THE DOOR OFF
Is the car unlocked ? Is it 4 wheel   drive? Moonroof or sunroof?
I hope they were able to save her in time! Did she survive? 😮
Why was he hesitant at first?😮
Just curious if they were having to use a punch how did the brave little boy get out?
This cop asks too many questions! Just do your job!
Was that Liam?
Where the heck was she driving to
how in tf did she even get there😂😂
The son knows she has seizures, so why does she have a license, why is she driving, why isnt she arrested for child endangerment?
Is somebody in there? Are you armed?
Did she live?
How did the car in up in the pond???
Good samaritain cop? He asked too many questions and hesitated to start.
This a hole, is someone in there? Yess that's why the kid brought you over an why someone is still trying by the car..use your brain
Did she live?
Why do they keep giving me these propaganda videos of the police and Drake on youtube?
Don’t they carry a glass punch on their belt?
Is the little man and he's momma all right ? Thats what we wannah know. 😮😮😮
That cop sure did take his time walking to ask more questions. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Did she do it on purpose?
He is a cop… isn’t that his job to serve and protect?
The cop asking if is somebody in there. After the kid just mentioned his mom was in there. TfkS is that
Im kind of thrown off by the cops slow reaction and the "is someone in there" question. Clearly they're trying to save someone smh
Another useless cop who thinks just their presence brings anything to the table lol he really asked “is anybody in there?” He must be scared of the water touching his knees
Why they ask if the cars unlocked…just goo 😭
How can drive in the sea?
How you mean if shes in there?
You can hear a screaming and he has to ask if someone in there?
Could he go any slower
Did anyone else think why is the cop moving SO SLOW??????
Did she live?
Why he keep asking if his mom is in the car? The boy ain’t speaking Spanish is he?
Good Samaritan? I hate when cops get labled that. They took the oath and its there career to be a public servant. Not a good Samaritan just doing what they're paid to do
How come we don’t see those short faces women cops doing this stuff? 😅😅😅😅
Why did he have to tell you more than once his mom was in there?
Did anyone else see the other video where the cop looks like a complete sociopath with no haste?
How did the boy get out? Did he shut the door after he got out?
The questions are annoying when the situation is Obvious. No time for it.
Has that cop ever heard of urgency?
Did the cop really ask if there was somebody in there shouting at the car? Smh I mean I'm glad everything worked out in the end but damn.
idk...he was told somebody was in there but he still asking if somebody in there? thats weird
Why the hell did the cop wait so long to go in.
Can he move any slower? GEEZ
Why don't all cops carry glass breakers.
Anybody know how this resulted in the end?
He was taking too long asking if she was in there!
Em sorry. I mean yes, good the officer helped but is that not his job?
Is the car unlocked? Really!!!!
How you get in there? Far from the main road
Is somebody in there 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Is someone in there? Is someone in there? 😂 Because I ain’t going in no damn water unless I have to
The dramatic rescue????
This cop talking to a submerged car is like 911 operators asking if they‘re breathing after a dead body was reported
Why does this look like it’s from the 90’s. Lol.
I don't necessarily think people who have seizures should be aloud to drive. That's a danger to themselves and others. And from what I understand seizures kinda happen on they own without warning?? Or am I wrong?
Yeah, but how did it happen? Like, how did she get off the road into the water?
Why do videos stop far shorter than they should?Is there some other link?People want us to click on so we can see the whole goddamn video
He begged you to help his mom yet you're sitting there asking if anyone's in the vehicle
The questions the cop were asking 😠
“Is someone in there?” Bro wym
"Is the car unlocked?" At that point it didn't matter either way. You're still going to have to break in. Smh
Could the cop be/act any slower?
Did you notice that they are white guys helping?? People is always trying to pin white against black but you don’t see things like this go viral
Why on earth is that guy just standing there asking questions when she could be dying and the boy already explained that his mother was in the car
Police asking stupid questions while somebody dying
Wasted a minute asking if someone who's underwater if they are in there what a idiot
Where are all the cop-haters now?
Who has the guts to make this video? Is that more important then rescuing?!?
Cop yells… “is somebody in there?!!” like what’s she supposed to say from underwater… yeah, I’m in here?!! Just wow. Talk about moving in slow motion 😩
Good boy brave escape but stuck leave him mom car inside? Man go help take her out, call EMT ,, man say thank boy brave,, save her.. God bless boy's mom❤❤❤
Not going to the cop was making me mad asking ia somebody in there , is she in there! YES BRO!!!! wasting time.
Could that cop be any slower.
These cops need to respond to emergencies more efficiently and stop being so clueless and questioning
Surprised the cop didn't ask him a million questions!
How is he a Good Samaritan? He's the police. He's doing his job. That's what he get paid for
How did the kid get out?
If they're underwater how can they respond
Did she survive???
I’m curious if the boy got out on his own and if he did then I’m curious what way because they had to break a window. Were they about to resuscitate her because she def dead when they pull her out.
Would have been dead after all them questions
If the cop could have taken his time any more
Did she survive?
How the fuck do you drive a motor vehicle into the damn pond 🤦🏾‍♂️
Why on earth was she driving with seizer disorder? Thank God she had her brave little boy with her
"Is the car unlocked?" There's a faster way to find out than asking a child. I was surprised at how slowly this cop handled the situation. You tell me a woman is drowning in a submerged car, I'm running and diving into the water and going for the door handle as fast as I possibly can.
Is somebody in there? Is wiiillllld
Did the woman survive
Could that guy move any slower?? Not the time for 50 questions. Just MOVE!!!!
Could the cop be any slower and hesitant? Literally the person is underwater.
Did the mom survive? I couldn’t imagine going through this
Does anyone know if a fund was set up to help the cost of medical bills and loss of income to support this brave hero while his mother recovers ? Bills and expenses add up quick and they may need help.
Cops annoy me. The boy was frantically telling you his mom was in the car. So èéṣe tí get to the car and ask “is there anyone in there?” What kind of asinine question is that?
Is someone in there the kid screaming my mom in there what you think this cop is not the sharpest tool in the shed 🤦🏻‍♂️
Why was the cop moving so slow doe?
D I d the punch work,I thought one time was all you had to punch.
“Is somebody in there?” …what kind of dumb ass question is that Officer of the Law?
this dude taking the time to ask if someone was in the car or not after literally finding out someone is in the car... like please take your sweet ass time
Is somebody in there? Like if somebody having a seizure is going to go yeah, I’m in here drowning!!! like the kid is freaking out about his mom having a seizure go save her
Did she live?
kid: "my mom had a seziure she's stuck in the car" cop: " is she in there? is somebody in there?"  keep waisting valuable time bud👍 typical cop not believing anything until they see it smh
The dumbass cop asking “iS SumONe een thEre?” makes me cringe so hard. There was no urgency to help get that woman out. Sickening how dumb some people are
Did she make it out alive
Is the car unlocked? Where you not going to try anyway?
Defund the who?
Dumbass cop just standing there asking questions.
I got angry when he asked “is there someone in there?”   And his ass was slow verses hurried moving towards the vehicle.
“Is somebody in there!?!?” Bro stfu and get yo ass in the water!!
Somebody in there ?? what a absolute stupid question to ask in such a situation 🤦are people that stupid?
Did she survive??
Can we please make it so people with known epilepsy cant have deivers liscenses this is scary
What happened to Mom, did she make it, is she ok?
Cop really didnt want to get in that water 😂 he asked like 5 times if someone was in there before helping
normal cop who stands there and asks questions 1st because he dont wanna get wet. YOUR WASTING TIME BUDDY!!!! GET YO AZZ IN THERE!
Did this turn out well?
Why does the officer keep asking questions? Just save the lady.
Why is he still asking questions when that baby is telling him and screaming "my mom"
I'm so glad everyone was saved, but the officer asked, "Is somebody in there?" I instantly went 🤦🏾‍♂️
Is somebody in there ?
why would the cop Halo is somebody in there when the boy already trying to tell him that was just dumb like she's going to say yes I'm in here.
Did she made it? Does anybody know?
That cop frustrated me, asking is someone in there? WTF what do you think? Just seemed like he didn’t want to go to work today
man stupid questions like "is somebody there?" get me annoyed like,noo I just brought u to this empty  crashed car  for fun ,it's annoying
Why was he going so slow?
So stupid to be asking someone who's drowning if they're in there! 😮
Cops like "whhhaattt?" Like get tf in there and help. bro asking questions like shes not drowning in a car passed out
Cops so stupid with stupid questions
Dumb question. Is the car unlocked?
Why didn’t he just go to the car instead asking is somebody in there 3 times little boy kept saying she’s have a seizure the mother couldn’t hear him  and took his time going in the water skin color made a difference for him  I hope everyone was saved
Is she in there? He had to ask? As is she could respond? I'm glad he helped but kid screams for help and he nonchalant walked over like I'm glad it wasn't me In that car
"is she in there?" Bruuhhh he ain't panicking for nothing
Cop didn't seem like he wanted to or is that just me?
Possibly same person that screamed defund the police.  What now? She going to sue because he touched her without consent to do so? Glad he saved her. Hopefully she comes out o.k.
Why don't they have a window breaker
Is someone in there??? My mom help her
Is the car unlocked?
He said his momma was in the car like 4 times and yet he keeps asking ???
Why did she go in the water, I don't know, but her boy clearly didn't want to go on without her.
So did the little boy jump out the car before? Or swim out the window?
Arnt you supposed to break the rear window?  And if thats not an option   the windshield?
So sad...... I feel for this young boy. Hope it turned out fine. If someone knows, please reply
What kind of question is, "Is she in there? Is somebody in there?" 🙄 Dumba$$, he kept telling you, "SHE'S IN THERE, SHE SUNK!" 🤨 We don't know if he saved her or not from this...🤷🏾‍♂️
that officer ask so patiently, “is anyone in there”? 😂/took his sweet time.
All the cnts who say ALL Cops Are Bad...is that really true? White cop risks his life to save black woman - not really a headline for the scum media. Good job this baby doesn't think the way you all do.
3  feet of water and the lady couldn't open the door and walk out like her son? But no she is inside panicking and waiting 15 minutes for the car to sink, some poeple just freez and no survival skills
Cop taking his sweet ass time too asking the same question over and over
Is she okay?
That cop had no sense of urgency, asking three times if she is in there when it's obvious there is, then he walks slowly into the water
He was in no damn hurry and the kids even told him and he slowly questioning it. Way to go little man glad y'all made it.
The cop ain’t do shit but keep asking is sombody in there 😊
Maybe lose the camera and help?
He asking stupid questions. Like someone is going to answer him from the water. The boy clearly told you his mom was in there. Ugh! 😑
cop: is there somebody in there?  omfg 😮
Why do I feel like he would have reacted faster if that was a little white girl
Is somebody in there? Nah dumbass, nah...
Michael and dwight?
Who Else Thought That Was Liam, From Shameless?
What's the title of the movie 😮
Why is that cop asking if the kid already told him his mom was already in the car  It seem like that cop didn’t want to get wet but did anyway to help out that kids mother
Well, is it just me or was that policeman reluctantly doing his job?
When are yall gonna learn that chargers and challengers are some of the worst handling vehicles.
If you have a seizure disorder, should you be able to drive?
Why was the cop not sprinting into the water? You see the emergency. Stop asking questions and move your feet!
Why not police officer?  Cop is a hateful term
"Is somebody in there?" When a person is fighting for his/her life. First save and later ask the question, I think that would be much better but for now good work❤ to the kid and the men out there.
I know I'm not the only one who ponders things like this...I see so many comments from people thanking God for keeping them safe and what not but if God is all knowing and has an individual life plan for each one of his children why does he have all these horrific accidents, homicides,  suicides,  etc in plan for his children??? And to make matters worse,   as a child of God, we're supposed to follow in christ footsteps and be as christ like as we can be??? I'm a follower of God but I'm good off that,  maybe that explains why our prisons are so full,  ain't no one gonna stand in front of a judge and jury claiming God told me too lol
"Is there somebody in the car?" Dude the kids scream she is in the car multiple times ffs
Is she in there is somebody in there  .. just go help 🤦🏽‍♀️
Why do they film this?
Child crying pointing saying she sunk and cop seeing submerged car asks is she in there? Is somebody in there??? 😢 Glad they helped thank God!
Asking if someone’s in there as they’re slowly drowning, what a moron
*Why isn't the cop moving like someone is drowning? He didn't seem to have a care in the world...*
I can't believe this a live saving ,whonare the saviors ?are they police? Fellow citizen?
is anyone in there? useless cop
How did she end up in the pond?
Could that cop move any fuckin slower damn
That little boy stopped you and tell you his mom needs help and you gonna ask a FK stup question, if she is in there.
“Is somebody in there?”
The cops asking so many dumb questions. "Is she in there" "is anyone inside the vehicle" "is the car unlocked" What will he ask for next? "Can I see your ID?" Come on man! Have some awareness of the situation. 🤦‍♂️
Why they still recording while saving someone
The boy is screaming his mom is in there and the cop is going 'hello is somebody in there?'
EMS step it up? I've seen molasses move faster than this cop.
Wasnt in too much of a hurry, was they,??😝
She didnt look alive to me, did she get resucitated ?
Could this cop have moved any slower?
Good Samaritan? Ain't that his job doesn't he get paid to do this
One dumb question, when cops jump into the water, are they doing it with their guns? I ask myself if they even work after being wet tho
“Is there someone in there?” no we’re just playing hide and seek. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Taking your time and asking if someone is in there after he runs up crying to you is lame.
How did she end up in the drink?
Whise camera?
I didn't think people who have seizures could drive?
Asking dumb questions not going to do nothing but waste more time
..is this a joke ? 🤔
Get off ur ass n go make sure it is clear instead of asking buddy!!
Did I C A Fish Flapping Out Of Someone Hand😂
Do these people have phones glued to them?
Dam that cop has to be dum as fuck, asking stupid questions like that.
Was she ok?? Why won't they tell us?? At least finish the video...😡
Poor baby! Thank you officer! What happened to them?
Im just wondering was it a random seizure or does she have epilepsy and if so, was it a break through seizure? Otherwise she shouldn't have been allowed to drive, as someone with epilepsy i cant drive as ive been having seizures for over 20 years. Where im from you need to be seizure free for a year in order to drive
Why was the car in the water? Was it intentionally?
Great job, rescuers Stupid question of the day: Is the car unlocked?  ☮️🌈🤎
I thought anyone that has seizures wasn’t allowed to drive? 😮 Well raised kids tho
Get my phone?  Really these are our public servants.  I think no I demand we do better.
Shes having a seizure.  Hello is anyone in there?!? Ems step it up? Bruh doesnt even know you cant talk while having one.
Why was the police officer so hesitant? Not saying he didn’t do his job, but it’s almost like he was saying shit I don’t want to get wet uuuugggghhh now I have to get in there.
Where is tge whole video?
Now that I am confused about is were the children in the car with the mom while she crashed into the pond and then the kids were able to get out but then the doors somehow locked behind them as they were trying to get the safety I don't know
Good Samaritan? That’s what cops are here for. It’s crazy when a cop actually does something he’s suppose to do he’s called a Good Samaritan lmao
That cop dead didn’t want to go, asking “is somebody in there?” While the car is under water is wild
If the person in the car was drowning they wouldnt be able to answer your question officer
Good Samaritan cop? Or a cop doing his job?
Take ya damn time asking questions while Someone is drowning
“Is she in there?” can we please give these protect and serve people IQ tests ffs
Where's the urgency from this cop?
I hope we aren't pretending that pick pockets dont follow every single Olympic location? They are a breeding ground for thieves no matter which country it goes to
What happened to mother! She was unconcious I guess! Not clear!  Under water!
Asking a question wasting precious time...bad news!
Please tell me she survived... 💔❤️
Good job on getting her out all three of you, sincerely. I have to ask am I the only one wondering why he's just casually walking like he knows she's already gone when the kids is begging him to help and he says "is there anybody in there"?
I commend him for getting out to go find help for his mom add for the men that help their heroes as well but my question is how did the car wind up over there and all that water😢❤ my heart goes out to the young boy and his mother I pray that she recovers 🙏🏾
Does anyone know if she lived, or was it too late?? That's a long time to be in the water.
How did the car get in there?
How did the kid get out.  I’m Confused
How did he get out if they had to break windows.
Why is that cop taking his sweet old time at the beginning???
Is the car unlocked? What a bizarre question. “No sir I locked it while my mum had a seizure”
Somebody need to figure if ya have siezures dont drive simple
Why is the cop so relaxed?
....... is it just me or did he not move fast enough?
Is it just me or does it seem like the police officer showed very little urgency in this situation?
Is it just me or were they struggling with the side window when the back window was out the water and easier to break i hope everything turned out okay because every second counts
Cop was moving way too slow and asking too many questions
Why did the cop take so long to
How about you stop asking questions and try to save the woman!
Is she okay???
Why doesn't this make the main stream media?!    Because it doesn't fit the agenda.
Why is he taking his time instead of just saying is she in there just listen to the kid because she can die within seconds 🏊🏃 ask questions later
Defund the police, am I right? That’s sarcasm for you lefties
taken his sweet time a bit much?  is someone in there? Is the car unlocked?
Did he do the work or the child?
Did she live?.
Why is the cop asking dumb qustions.
Why ask questions if you hear the situation 🤷
So, did she live?
Did she drown or what don't see her
Why are the cops’ body cam footage always available for stuff like this, but in other cases, they “forget” to record, or the footage gets lost? Weird how that works… It’s almost like they are a corrupt and dishonest institution.
Are there alligators in that part of TX? 😲
This guy asked if the car was unlocked 😅
why was she driving
AIs this momma and family okay? 🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐💞💞💞🫂🫂🫂
Pig movie slow af asking stupid questions
Without looking him up, who can guess what this cop looks like?
Does anyone else notice that this overweight cop is moving slower than the speed of smell..... Like where is his sense of urgency?
Idk how that Lil boy got outa the car but he saved his mama's life ❤
how did this guy have time to film everything at the same time?.....filming would be the last thing on my mind in a situation like that?........
So did the cops do that girl?
Am I the only one erked by the cop's dumb questions? The boy gave more than emough info to get him going immediately!
IQ test, open the back doors or the front?
What caused her to go In the water????
Did she survive?
Did she live??
Why the camera gotta be part of the rescue?
I wonder if the cop gave her a ticket he sounds a little bit like that type
Do they allways carry under water cameras  or is this a act.
Just wondering why you would have a camera at the ready.
And why is she driving?
Dude askin dumb ass question after the boy told him the lady was in there. If it weren’t for the Samaritan it may have ended differently.
Is it just me or was the guy slow af?!
Is the car unlocked? GET IN THERE!!! FFS...
Poor little boy he was so frightened.. trying to get help for his mom.. thank you for the man that saved her.. is she okay?
Is there somebody in there lol
I wonder how the boy got out but the doors were locked/ windows shut. Or did I miss that?  Poor precious boy. That’s trauma. I hope she makes a full recovery for his sake and hers.
Why is he walking all casually  is there anybody in there, stupid
The man with the cameras asking if somebody in there? It’s like what the hell do you think the kid drove the car himself into the water asking for help for his mom? What a stupid question.
I’m still trying to figure out why this cop is questioning the situation and not getting in there…Does it seem like no one is in there?
I don't understand why ask if someone in there.... just go in bro...wtf. ...I'm glad the cop help but those precious seconds of asking that dumbass question matter...
"Is there somebody in there?" Bro are you deaf? The kid told you exactly what the situation was.
Why tf did the cop just walk there like that? No rush or urgency at all!
The cop standing on the grass hollering is she in there is anybody in there while the kid is in the water panicking is insane 😳
Is she in there? Save her. WHAT??
Did she survive?
Dude took way too long asking questions when urgency was needed
I’m not sure if she survived or not
Is somebody in there while a child cried for help STRAIGHT LAME
If he woulda jumped into action faster it wouldn't of been so dire, it appears but who knows
Could the cop be any slower asking the most redundant questions. Just get there and save the women. Elmer Fud
Seems fishy she drove that far off in to a pond.
How was that a dramatic reaction?
Is she alive?
That cop didn't save no one... asking stupid questions knowing what the kid said ....Just plain trash officer. Thanks to the man who saved the lady
That cop is pretty slow though, the kid is crying telling him that his mom is insane the car, cop keep asking is there anyone in the car 😐
Why did the lazy cop stand at the edge of the water while the kid was in the water looking for his mom!!!
Am I the only one annoyed at the cop's lack of urgency?
Why did it take the officer so long to get to the car and rescue lady Little boy was there first. That's sad.
Good Samaritan my a$$ b$tch a$$ cop ain’t even wanna get in is she in there? No shit u think its a prank wtf
Did they save her?
Was she saved?  All we see is the drama unfolding.
Who is recording???
Listen to the dumb questions the cop is asking while the kid is calling for his mom and pointing towards the car 🤦🏽‍♂️
And why don’t they have the window poppers? SMH
Why the fuck would you be recording this?
Why save them?
Why is this hillbilly asking so many questions?
He could’ve had more of a sense of urgency. He literally kept asking the kid if there were someone in there, even though the kid already told him multiple times there was.
Is she in there? is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked? Stressed me out. Way to hustle officer smh.
Soooo, why was the car in the water...😳
How long was she under. Shes a trooper. Thank god for good people.
"Is somebody in there?" Might be the dumbest question of all time given the situation
Is someone in there wtf kinda question
Is the car unlocked is a wild question
So what did the cop do again?
Any updates?!
Screaming for help, casually waits and ask 2 times is someone in there derp
My question is, why was this cop so nonchalant, I would have been in that water immediately.....unless its Florida...the got gators 👎🏾
Omg hello os soneone in there??? Her son said help his mom shes stuck in the water
why do people drive knowing damn well they have seizures very selfish
What was the outcome I hate these quick little drastic issues that never give us the outcome I pray she made it poor child did everything he could
Did she survive?
What did the officer do😮
Is that Florida
Zero urgency wtf man. Seconds count. Be contentious
How did she get in there?!
I knew about the swimming, but the driving to?
Any word on his mom?
Sem like the cop was asking questions but wasn't listening for the answers.
This fucking cop asking “is she in there?” Bro, what?
Is that the kid from shameless ?
Poor baby scared for her mom. How the hell did her mom end up in there in the first place
Is the car unlocked?
What a dumb cop. Hears the boy screaming his momma is having a seizure and she sunk...gets to the cop then proceeds to start asking "is there somebody in the car?" Can't stand stupid people, especially stupid cops.
So nobody sees the cops lack of sense of urgency as a problem, and the fact that he wasted time standing there asking a dumb question... "Is somebody in there?" Clearly the driver seat is submerged in the water, how would anybody respond?? Then the boy is clearly fresh out the water and trying to get you to hurry up and save her, he already told you she was in there!
He sure took his precious time gettin to the car. I wonder fast he would have spead up if that was his mother in there😮😮😮
How are you gonna stand there wasting time asking if someone is in there while the car is under water?  Get in there and save her the boy told you she was in there.
The cop was asking some really lame questions… is somebody in there?? Really?
Lol good Samaritan, hes asking questions instead acting and who wouldnt help seriously
Why yell is someone in there if she is drowning I don't think she could answer?
Hmmmm, thinking she would not have chose the bear….
Why was he filming though?  I wouldn't think to film someone having a life or death crisis...I'd just help.
What is a punch?
Was she rescued in time, I fear that she wasn’t 😬? That poor lad witnessing it all, so traumatic for him x
It goes without saying that I'm very glad the mother was saved, but the boy seemed to know his mother was having a seizure. I'm just wondering why she would drive when she knows it's dangerous to drive if you suffer from seizures. Example in hand.
Did he ask the boy if the car was unlocked?
Who DF is filming
I don’t feel the cop cared enough 😢 why keep asking if there’s someone in the car AFTER the boy crying telling you his mom is in the car??? That’s seconds taken from her life😢
I'm just curious.. how did that car end up there... I didn't see no road near the water...
So whats the outcome???
I'm thankful she was rescued and her son made it out of the car.  That alone is a miracle.  Was this her 1st seizure?  Please don't risk driving if you have a history of seizures.  You can't be replaced.
Is the car unlocked... Really??!!;/
Was that Liam?
Is the car unlocked? 😂 wtf
Cop wasting time asking if someone is in there... yes the boy didnt show up soken wet and take you to an accident for no reason.
Poor baby is desperate, and he stands ashore asking if there's somebody in the car... I think being stupid is a requirement to be a cop in the united states
Why was he asking so many questions?
I hope she’s okay! 😮 Any updated?
But why drive when you know you normally have seizures? What's the point.
Is the momma ok? I am crying and praying. Is she ok?
When the cop walked up to the water mad slow standing there asking if somebody was in the car while the kid was literally screaming.........like cmon bro tf you doin
PLEASE TELL ME SHE MADE IT!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
If u have seizures regularly maybe u shouldn’t drive
Boyy yall ever heard of gators
Dude the kid said his mom was in there and youre standing there saying is she in there? Is somebody in there? No, no ones in there thats why that terrified child is there panicking crying telling you she's in there
Could the cop have moved any slower? This is the moment most cops (when they're children) wait their entire lives for to be the hero and save someone. This cop lolligagging around taking his sweet ass time. Thank god for that civillian was acting fast
Cop asks questions instead of taking action immediately,  what the f?
I'm not sure how to react, is this urgent or a stroll in the park.
What is de cop doing on the other side of the care while the other man in the water tries to save her?
Is she in there? Like wtf do you think this is officer smh
What an idiot. He just stands around and asks questions. "Is she in there? Is somebody in there? Is the car unlocked?" THE KID IS DESPERATELY TELLING YOU THAT SHE IS. GOOD GRIEF.
Cop wasted some valuable seconds asking if any one is in the car. wtf. 🤬
Is there somebody in there? What did lil man tell you !
Why did the first cop have zero sense of urgency?
Are you seriously videoing this when that lady is drowning
Got to be the slowest cop ever literally won't even go in the water is she in there is she in there why don't you get in the water and check That's why we're paying you for and then walk slowly all the way up there just weird
U mean theses tyrants don’t just shoot people?
Women drivers how that even happen
weird. did she let the kid out of the car before she drove into that lake?
I'm glad he saved the woman's life but it's almost like he's second-guess the kid cuz the kid is soaking wet and told him my mom is down there in the car she had a seizure and when he comes up to the vehicle he says is she in there😮
My heart is breaking!! Did she survive?
"is somebody in there?" As multiple ppl are screaming for your help 🥴 just take your time there, buddy
Could he take any longer.
Why tf didn’t he rush in…?  Ain’t no reason to be so hesitant to approach… Yeah, could be an instance of drug use, but the kid indicated she has a history of seizures. Not to mention… even if she was on drugs, it’s better to have a black eye and scratches than see a woman lose her whole damn life.
DAMNIT!!!.... Did momma live or not!? Please say she did!!
Good Samaritan? He was casually strolling to ..do his job.
How in the world do people with a seizure disorder get a driver's license
Ya no hurry 😮 jus keep asking questions 😡
What happened with her. She make it?? The poor boy
Another cop asking stupid questions.  He was not eager to save that woman life 😮
That cop literally asked “anyone in there" After the boy said that his momma was in there drowning
Smh why is this cop asking dumb questions! Glad that other guys was there to start the process fr
How did the kid get out,or did this happen close to where the kid was & saw it happen,anyway glad to read it ended okay. ✌
Why is he so sloww ?
Anyone else got frustrated because he wasn't acting quick enough??
The cop taking to long for me if it was a white person he wouldn’t even keep asking the son if she’s in the lake 😂
She is underwater and he asked if anyone is in there? She gonna scream yes?
got a kid begging to help saying someones in there and u question that as a officer
His ass asking questions instead of moving quickly!!! If a panicked child told you she sunk, why are you asking questions??
Is she in there? Is somebody in there? Seriously??? 🤦🏿🤦🏿 I just can't. Thank God there were other people around. Reading the comments makes me happy knowing she and her son will see better days 💕🙏🏿
What's with the thousand questions before helping? She's drowning!
How did the boy get out? He's a smart and brave kid. ❤
Yelling “is somebody in there”? Do you think that baby is lying? And do you expect to hear her yelling under water or that she can hear you?
Is she in there? He's taking his sweet ass time
Why is the cop asking is someone in the car when the child already told him??? Just save her 😮😮😮
'Is she in there?!' Dude, that young man TOLD YOU she was..  and why is the cop holding the camera?
Did he drop her in the end back in the water WTF???
But is she in there
Is she dead?
Is it just me or was this cop " dragging" his feet? I watched and felt like he was moving in slow motion in the beginning.
Did he save her???
Is there no regulations on issuing a driver's license to people that are at risk of seizures?
Is anybody in there?  C'mon man
Talk about taking your sweet time!! Kid shows up soaking wet told his mom stuck in the car you show up to the scene still asking questions… WTF!!
Why is no one talking about the indifferent, lethargic response of the officer. You'd think he was stepping into the hotel swimming pool when the water was a little cold. No urgency whatsoever 😡
Coo was slow asking dumb questions
If she’s drowning how she suppose to answer ?!? he was suppose to jump in the water…too slow to my liking.  I mean he was calm which was excellent but I didn’t sense the urgency on his reaction
Why are people so incompetent smh
This cop took to damn long askin to many questions
How come they had time to record this
So did the boy lock the doors when he got out?
The cop stood around asking questions because he didn't want to go in the water...
Why ask him more than once ??
I'm glad she is ok but could that guy be any slower to jump in the water and help this lady oh my goodness it takes second for someone to drown jeeezzz 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Why u jus standing there asking if she's in there when that Lil kid jus told u she was in there... wtf dude. Pick up the pase like could u move any slower dude
Is she in there?? Really ??? Come on you don’t question you act right away .. good this the person is ok,
Is this cop ok asking if the car is unlocked
Officer wasred time asking questions of someone who was submerged, dang it!🤨
Cop asked more questions then anything
What kind of idiot keep asking if she is in there don’t he see the situation and the boy just told you she is in the car and that was the slowest I seen someone go in to help like if he was scared of the water jump in to action man
What a dumb question is anyone in there BOI SHE WAS SCREAMING SO LOUD MATE
why is he yelling is someone in there?  the little boy had to say help her?
Is somebody in there? No response? Aight imma head out.
Is somebody in there?  No it just drove it's self
How's she operating a vehicle when she has seizure?
Why tf did he hesitate to go in the water and ask if someone was in there after the kid already told him what happened?!?
Is the car unlocked?   . . . . . Do you want me to get you a key cut . . Hang on I've just got a phone call . . 😊.
Who's recording this and why?
I'm sorry but the kid told him before they arrived what was going on and then he gets there and keeps yelling 'Is SoMeBoDy iN tHeRe?? 🥴'
Is this Florida?? Cuz MURKY WATER + LILY PADS = GATORS!!!!!! Sorry kid 🏃‍♂️ J/K!!! She's actually OK.  Thank God!!
IS THAT NOT HIS JOB TO HELP?????
Man fuck asking questions man, get in and help.
Why was the police officer asking if anyone was in the car after the child frantically told him she’s having a seizure she’s in the car she’s in the water?
Is he really asking is someone in their the kid told you his momma was in their 😢
Why was the cop not acting with urgency? Yeah he helped, but hewas pretty relaxed even when he saw the car literally half way in, and asking,"is she in there? Is somebody here?" Come on.
Why is he asking if someone is in there when the boy already told him his mom was in there?
Cop asking dumb questions just go and help the poor lady "is the car unlocked" he asked  stupid cop
How’s his mom??? ❤
Yeah, Officer, this is the time to ask a bunch of questions not the time to take action ffs
Why are you asking if someone is in there when this boy JUST told you his mom was in there 😡 Very unnecessary
Officer is too busy asking questions, when he should've immediately went to the car to see if anyone was stuck inside... in life or death situations every second counts...
Is somebody in there???...wth ..go see
The boy is begging for help and he asking 21 questions.
how did he know she was having a seizure? she must have a history of it.
If she was having a seizure, as in epileptic seizure, why is she driving?? Awful accident.
Why would you record this and not just save her lol
Couldn't tell if she was ok. Can someone reply and let us know?
My heart goes out to little man....great job young fella along with the cop and the man that was already in the water...but my question does she have a history of seizures ?? If yes why is she still driving?? Just a question
Is somebody in there????  Thanks to the other  person   this Mother is alive!
If ses having a seizure why foes she have a drivers license ? In sweden you cant have a license if you have certain health issues
Is somebody in there?-  if you’re underwater and having a seizure could you tap once- tap twice if the child is exaggerating because I’m pretty sure that’s why I move in slow motion?
Cop asking questions in the beginning is annoying. There's a car and someone needs help is enough for anyone not to question but silence and actions
Dumb question,  asking the kid if car is unlocked
How she got in there??😢
Cop wasn't to concerned took it lightly and asked too many questions
How is she doing?! Amen to the kid who was able to get out and get help. Prayers!!!
He was just taking his time like wtf
Why tf is he moving super slow? He didnt call no for a ambulance it took that lil boy screaming at him to help her for him to go in that water
WTF you mean,"Is somebody in there?". He already told you she was. Then he asked is the car unlocked. STUPID QUESTIONS BUDDY!! But thank GOD he got her out in time to save her.
The cop keeps asking if she is in there.Yes she in there,moving slow,he does not want to get wet!!!
Did she live?
Oh man, that poor kid, is somebody in there? YES, THE KIDS MUM LIKE HE JUST TOLD YOU😮
Hello, are you ok?  Are you in there? Do you have your id and insurance?  Mamm you can't park there
Why is the cop being so slow about it when the child is screaming to help her? I’m happy she was saved but that dude had me upset
So he told kid get in let’s go down there in beginning of vidio ,,,, how far did kid run to get help finally or how many people seen this and figured not going stop cause didn’t want be late for work or soccor practice or didn’t want get stuck in traffic????
Can she NOT drive from now on—-just to be on the safe side😢❤❤
Hpw many times was the child going to tell the cops his mom was in there!.
Why would ask is somebody in there
Thank God for her rescue. But, I thought people with seizures are not allowed to drive or operate heavy machinery equipment! Am just asking. JMO
Why the police was so slow and also repeatedly asked "she is there? Somebody is there" ...why didn't react immediately? Damn, there is NO time to lose in that questions
Still want to defund the police?
Well, he said she was having a seizure and he still asks about someone being in there before getting out to help. Should have just went.
How did he get out, couldnt they have gotten in that way?😮
So many irrelevant questions by the officers in the beginning
How did she even end up in there@?? And did her son crawl out the window!!??? ❤ 😢
What was it the one man handed to the other guy?
Why was he asking if someone was in there when the kid just told him the details?
Officer moving so slow continuing on asking dumb questions
The little boy told him that his mom was in the car but he still walking up to the pond asking "is she in there"
" is there somebody in there? .... I mean.... there's this kid in a panic...... but I don't want to get wet...... is there anybody in there? "  Take your time, officer nice guy..... she ain't  going anywhere.
Umm..it looks like the sin was doing the adults job..smh......asking if someone is in there.....he already said there was....and he took his sweet time helping her
did the cop want her to die why would he be so slow to help
Kid is telling the cop to help his mom in the car and he was like is somebody there? and hesitating to look for someone to help!😢
Why did Momma launch that car into a body of water? That isn’t the kind of thing that happens often.
What do we pay cops for?  Seems to be in no rush.
are you telling the truth black kid? Are you sure? I still don't believe you well okay, let me see but I'm going to take my time just in case.
Why is she driving knowing she has  seizures
Was that a damn fish??
Anything known how they are doing?
Why do cops ask such stupid ass questions
I wonder if it was the cops wife or child would he have been taking his sweet time like he was in this situation
Did she make it. OMG that poor child❤
Damn, could the Cop have moved any slower? 😢
What are we looking at…. ?
Why no description??? Hate when you do this,,, 🥵🥵🥵😞😞😞😞😞😞
Why is the cop taking so slow
Did he escapee the car?
Is someone in there? What do you think he stopped you for?
He hesitated way too much
Ok. Maybe we'd all like to know how the car ended up in the water in the first place? Just asking!
A woman driver?  Why am I not surprised?
Is the car unlocked? As he slowly walks into the water. Wow.
The guy asking is somebody in there annoyed me bad!! He expected a response from someone who was drowning!? 🙄
Is somebody in there? Like wtf u think the little boy ran to you for
I wish they blurred that babies face. When did it become ok to publicize children especially in such vulnerable times. Sending prayers to the family. I hope mom is ok. This young man is a hero.
I'm glad the woman is okay, but  this cop is not a good samaritan, that's literally his job and once they're at the car he stands there and asks if someone's in there like dude go look , didn't want to get his nice clean pants wet
Is anyone in there ? Cop actually asked after kid frantically says someone stuck
The child knows what a seizure is. This makes me wonder why the mother was driving at all if she has a history of seizures(?). Lucky they are alright now.
A little slower guys. Ask more questions that he literally told you in panic dhe second he saw you!!! This pisses me off. Its a miracle sjes even ok!! Tsk 😡
“Is she in there….. is somebody in there?”   The son BEEN SCREAMING THAT HIS MOM IS IN THERE I feel like this cop took too much time, every half second matters when you’re under water!!!
Him just standing there asking if someone was there pissed me tf off…like that little boy just said that his mom was having a seizure and is drowning 🤨
What kind of dumb ass question is that ?Boy says my mother's in there, Officer says is somebody in there.(Repeatedly)ughhhhhh..
You can hear that poor woman screaming and still asking if there's somebody in there? Are you freaking serious right now??????????
“Is she in there? Is somebody in there?”After a frantic WET boy just told you she in the water.  🤦🏾‍♀️
Awe… I feel so badly for that Child. Was the Mother alright? ♥️♥️♥️
Why the cop so damn slow
Why is the cop so slow and calm, and asking all those questions. Just get in the water and save her.
Amazing kid. Amazing cop. Does anyone know the outcome?? I hate these nonclosure videos
Do anybody one knows his name the officer?❤
Did she survive?
is somebody's in there ? really taking your sweet little time while they could die is not a hero .
Sorry but cops asking if she In there when lil boys already Told cop his Mamas In the car!!?? Plus lil boys all Wet, frantic, etc .....Cops moving Real Slow like he dont wanna get wet or Save A LIFE!!!💔
Him asking if someone is in there kinda made me mad I'm not gone lie... But I'm happy he helped
What an idiot! Is someone in there? Did this idiot cop think the mom was going to pop her head up and say, "yeah!, I'm in here!"
I'm confused - not saying my mama and she's in water but coo asking if anyone in there. Where's the running to the car? Seconds count.
Is that the kid back in the water
did his mom live??????
Is the car unlocked? Wow
That man moving in slow motion or is it just me 😮
Can that person be any slower asking if anyone is in there when that poor baby is crying pointing saying momma. Dear God
where are the cop haters????
Did she survive?
WHO WAS FILMING THE WHOLE THING??
What’s wrong with that cop asking if she is in there when the kid is crying to save his mom that’s stuck in car
Is she drowning?
I hate to be that guy but why is she driving…
Is it just me or was the cop just taking his sweet time?? Was he telling the child to break the window?? And if so isn’t that his job??
What's the outcome? Did she make it ⁉️ Thank you to all that Responded
Is somebody in there? Is the door unlocked... stupid questions to ask seconds are ticking away Yes, his mom was driving the car, so obviously (kid even said it when he said hurry help), and im sure the kid double-checked to make sure the doors were unlocked before they crashed!!!
Oh that poor baby! That broke my heart, and then the guy actually asked ”is somebody in there”? Are you effing kidding me? Well, at least he got her out! 🤍🤍
He did not seem like it was too urgent. I hope she made it. Boy, what luck for that kid though, that cop must have been driving by. Or maybe her head was above water, and he called 911? So many questions
Is somebody in there. Is wild, good video
Is she ok??? Tell me these babies didn't just loose their mama
Is the mother ok??! I pray that she is!! Her son is her Angel!!!💖💖💖🙏🙏🙏
What ended up happening???
Can someone explain, why did he have to put the kid in back of the patrol car?? 🤔🤔
But did she actually survive? She didn’t look conscious to me
How did he get out, the kid??
IS SHE IN THERE? IS SOMEBODY IN THERE? My man, the child JUST TOLD you she’s in there, just get to saving her. Damn.
I wonder if she supports defunding the police now?
why was the cop moving so slow in the beginning
Any update on the mom
Is someone in there......wow
Does anyone know if she is still alive? This is so sad!!!
Was that a baby kid they were carrying out weres the mom
Was he also inside? How did he know?
Since when is a cop saving a drowning women a Good Samaritan? He's just a dude doing his job people.
We’re just going to ignore the lackadaisical nonchalant behavior and rhetorical questions of the “cop”…? THANK GOODNESS a Good Samaritan was there the cop was doing nothing!
I hate how they ask so many questions like just get to helping and shut up
What a stupid ass question
I don’t get it?! The child said “she’s having a seizure, she’s sunk, please help her” and your response is “is she in there, is anyone in there”? Time wasted because you already have the answers
Is the car unlocked? WHAT?????
Is she okay 🤔🤔
Is the car unlocked??!?! wtf, yea, that’s what that scared little boy is thinking of/remembering if it is or not as the cop strolls on down to help. . .
Was the car stolen?
Why is he asking is somebody in there. The child took you there for a reason. The person was having a seizure 😑 Smh he was ready to let that lady die. Thank god he had a change of heart. 💯
So grateful they were able to save his mom! Did anybody see this story on the news? A white cop saving a black woman… hmmm
They got there in time though right? shorts don't normally show the end or do we have like a whole video that we can link please?
Update?  Bless his heart 😢
Do any car makers equip cars with a window breaker? 🤔
Why did the officer take so long to jump into the water?
Was she alive?!
Why in the fuck did he wait so fucking long ?
Where does it say she was saved? Does anyone know for sure?
Did she make it? Lord, have mercy.😢
How many times does this distraught child have to tell this cop his mother is actively dying before he shows any sense of urgency?
Is it me or the cop was way to clam and slow in a situation where someone could be drowning inside a car but his whole energy changed when there was a good Samaritan trying to help.
Is somebody in there? Did I hear that? 👂🏼 bruh what’s the point of that kid calling him for?
Is she in there? Well what do you think.
He took forever wtf
Good on the cop but half of America hates cops so...? I hope this kid remembers a cop saved his mom's life and will respect the blue instead of hating those who just want to help save people. The kid is very brave, good on his sweet soul.
How did he got out
He really doesn't want to go in the water but his cam was turned on... Idk
Sooooo it didn't show how he saved her or if she is ok?
How was the kid doing more than the officer?
Oh my Jesus! Did they get her out in time??
Did she live?
Did she make it? Where is the rest of the story?
He was asking if the car is locked
Why was he moving so slow, bro? I would’ve been diving in. What the hell
Can you ask more questions…before you actually help.  🙄
Omg! Is she ok?? That poor kid...I hope his mom is fine.
cop acting stupid with those questions.
Is she ok?
Why is the officer show to respond?
Does anyone know if she is ok? What a brave and wonderful son? 🙏
Is she in there? Is anyone in there is the questions this cop asked after the young man told him she was in there and having a seizure. I didn’t see any urgency from this cop non what’s so ever. I don’t know if the mom made it out but GOD bless the young man because he’s the true hero.
How old is Mama be okay
What happened to running and diving into the water to save a damsel in distress? He was strolling asking dumb ass questions.
Is this lady has seizures she should not be driving
Sooo a soak and wet child ask a cop for help, and the police get to the emergency, and ask before getting in the water “is anybody in there”? 😮 sooo you can’t put 2and2 together 😢
The Cop keep asking is someone in the Car… WTF!!! 🤦🏽‍♂️
Could this asshole cop move any slower.
It’s unclear if the mother is alive.
Is somebody in there? Yea dummy he told you!!!  Like hurry up tf!?🤬 Poor baby, hope both are well❤️‍🩹
“Is she in there?, is the car unlocked?” Are you Fuckin kidding dude? Jump in and find out
Did she live!!??😢
Did his momma live
Come on man...why u ask if she's in there after the kid mentioned it......the heck
Did She survive???
So what happened?
What a stupid question 🙄   yes! She's in there.  She's stuck...he told you!!! Get her out now!
he said she's having a seizure...the person goes is she in there the kids is telling them she's in there ...what is it they don't understand...
Nahhĥ bruh.....the question is why is she in there ?
How is she ❤️
Why drive when you know you have such a health condition?
Is somebody in there? 🤦🏾‍♂️
She's having a seizure, cars upside down and underwater  Cop: is somebody in there? 🥴
Is she in there? Is car unlocked? Hey how much gas did she have in the tank? Why aren't you in school? Did she drive in the water on purpose? How old is she? Does she got any id on her?
Was it a rescue? That child broke my heart. 😢 I felt every bit of his plea.
Could the cop have moved ANY slower?
Just take your time! Fyi? People under water cannot answer when you ask "anyone in der"! Just stupidity in Action!
Video starts with the boy saying his mom is in the water and the guy proceeds to ask if she is in the water 😖 just dumb lol and lack of active listening skills
Why does this cop make stupid questions?
OMG, does a seizure have a prior indicator? 😢 The cop got wet diving under water are they trained for such?
Cops man. Asking questions that don't matter when that kid freaking out.
I need a follow up...is she ok.
Take your time! No rush! "Is the door locked?"
Is making so much effort to get her out no sense of urgency
How could speak if she's under water and having a seizure? He kept asking is anyone in there...
COPS SO SLOW AND ASKING IF SOMEONE IN THERE THAT POOR CHILD JUST TOLD HIM HIS MOM IN THERE. WHAT HAPPENED DID SHE MAKE IT? SLOW RESPONSE 😞
That cop sucks asking stupid question like is the car unlocked and is there anyone in there, instead of rushing to help the woman.
Cop had some really stupid questions after being given pertinent info.
Whys he so slow
Y he asking if someone in the car. He just told u stop.wasting time smh
The fact that he’s asking questions that was already given to him in a time where he should be desperate to save a woman.. that he already knows! is in the car, in the water.. the response time is shit
How????? What happened??
why does the video stop short?
Why was the cop moving so slow
Way to go to take your time to get to the car and ask twenty times “is someone in there” after the boy just told you 5 times before that his mom is in there…
"is she in there...?" Well obviously guy this young boy just came to you or anyone he could find then ran into water yelling mom at the car....id say his mom is in there like he told u
I thought people with seizures shouldn't drive?I hope she is ok😢
How in heck they get in themat water
Why ask the kid questions like that? Are the doors locked is she in their. Dipshit cop
Did the mom make it?
I wonder could they have popped the trunk?
So my question.... why are ppl allowed to drive when they randomly get seizures??I'm not saying they shouldn't but there should atleast be another licensed driver with her at all times or a grown person... in sa we allowed to drive with learners in  the block only but when going on the road u need a licensed driver present doesn't have to be behind the wheel but he must be present..until u pass out ur license ...
Why did he keep asking if someone was in the car when the little boy is crying telling him his mom is in there
How restarded is that cop? The kids telling you she's in there but you stand there with your thumb up your ass, he didn't save anyone. That guy did all the work.
What an idiot police why would you ask if someone in car when the kid is crying in already telling you his mom is in the car needed to be rescued
Was she saved?  She was under a while??🙏
" Is something in there?" 🙄 whatta mean sir ?  He just told desperately his mama is in there 🤨 I swear I always get a few gray hair with these police and 911 oparators delayed reactions.
"Is she in there? Is somebody in there!?" GO CHECK MF!! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ dont just keep asking the kid!
Omg he broke my heart. Was she ok after the rescue? Praying she’s ok.
All that time the officer spent asking if someone’s in there instead of helping could’ve been the difference between life and death.
When are they going to make cars that don’t sink?
Did his mom survive it doesn't show pray that she  Survive
As the cop struts over without urgency asking “are you in there?”.  However, glad she made it out.
is the car unlocked!! what type of question to ask that child
I think the officer was scared to go on the water while we ask if she and them in a little boy is telling him his mother is in a car to the officer he didn’t give up and still went
So what happened!!!!
My thing is i feel like the cop had no urgency in the beginning the kid told you someone was in the car and he still asked if someone was in there like you should have just drove right into that water after that kid cried like that all in all thankfully they saved her
Don’t squad cars have winches
Cop took his sweet time and why would he go out without his window punch the first time.
Is that the same kid from Shameless 😮
Why does this officer lack urgency?
Now tell me what kind of question is that. The kid told you his mom is in there.. omg
Did she live?  I really hope she's okay
If you look at the entire video in my opinion it took way too long for the officer to grab the mom from the car the kid kept begging and begging and then her daughter also came from the car and begged and begged and by the time he fast walked over to the car to get the mom there was already a Good Samaritan trying to get her out if you asked me the cop took way too long thank God she's okay
Cop didn’t do shat but ask a bunch of dumb questions
These clips never give enough info! Did the cop get her out or the EMS? How is she now,? Were there any lasting physical affects?
Is she ok?
Does anyone know what happened to her and her son? I’m hoping she made it and has recovered!
Why tf was she’s driving especially with her son in the car if she has seizures 😒
Bro why are you asking "is she in there" is somebody in there" when the boy obviously just came to you desperately crying saying his mom sunk in the water. You're literally just wasting time smh that infuriated me. It doesn't even sound like you cared at all. You were moving at your own speed with no sense of urgency smfh. What a f**king jerk. The other guy and that little boy are the real heroes ❣️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I need an update did she survive I hate when video ends like this now this gonna be on my mind 😢
Answer this? They can never swim !!!  Why is that?
Why did he ask if somebody is in there when the child told him? The lack of urgency is weird ... idgf what happened in the end the people onsight seems to be more of service
I'm still stuck on why this camera looks like it's from the 80s.  That poor little guy though! I pray she turned out okay!
Any updates on how the mom is?
Stop asking questions and get in there man
If they was white would he have hesitated the way he did.
How did the Momcome out?
Please tell me she lived!!!!!😢
My God just help the boy asking is somebody in there jump in man!!!
Why is he taking his sweet ass time
is there somebody in the car like he was lying,,,,,
Is the mom ok ❤❤son did he’s part praying for them
Does anyone know if this Mummy is okay? Her little boy is a hero. What a brilliant young man. Bless him. ❤
Does anyone have am update? Did the mom make it?💥🙏💥
How did she end up in a lake 😮
Please tell me they saved that baby’s mama 🥺🥺😭♥️ poor baby, you can see how terrified he is 🥺
Is she in there?  No im just a panicked kids running down the street screaming “she’s having a seizure” and “she’s in the water “ and pointing frantically at the car!!  Seconds matter.  Thank you for saving her life…. But really?
If shes prone to seizures, why is she driving in the first place? Lucky the son made it out too.
Could that cop move any slower? Is she in there? Really?!?! What a loser
Did she survive? Omg that poor child
Is his mother Ok? This is awful.
Is the car unlocked? Guess fkn what, go and check!! What on earth is going on in thats cop brain...brain on holiday?
How was she supposed to hear him calling? Hmm She is under the water sir.
Cop asking stupid questions
“Is somebody in there “ type question was that… so weird
Is she in there? What a slow ass question ?
How does this woman have a driver's license
Why is he asking is there some in there the kid just told him tht shit
“Is somebody in there??” x2  *BRO YOU HAVE A PANICKED CHILD TELLING YOU THERE IS* dive tf in! WTH
🙏🙏 update please is mom alright! Bless his heart the desperation in his voice, My Mom, that broke me
Saved or ....please tell!!!!😱🤯😭😭😭
Is the car unlocked bro stfu and figure out
Oh my god I feel so bad for that young boy.   I hope his mother is okay. Does anyone know how this turned out?
I wonder how the boy got out!
Could that cop have moved any slower?
Did that cop piss anybody else off
Can we get an update on the mom?
Could that cop move any slower
So how did the kid get out ? All doors and windows were shut. 🤔
Why keep asking is she in there ? The boy made me cry 💔 my heart goes out to him
Does anyone know if she's okay???
They be asking HELLA STU PID QUESTIONS. JUST GO. WTF ELSE ARE YOU DOING.. OUT THAT DONUT DOWN!!
He asking to many damn questions 😢
I want to know if she had a history of seizures?
People with seizures probably shouldn’t be driving.  Was she ok?
I'm sorry, but was it me or was he moving like he had no place to go?When there's an emergency, move your backside like you got someplace to go 😢
Yeah, ask more questions. I’m sure she got enough oxygen to survive charge crying mother day and he’s asking hundreds of questions
Did the boys mother survive,  does anyone know.
Not really sure how much the cop helped there 😅 He reluctantly entered the water, jiggled the door handle too many times while watching another guy get her out of the car. I mean, he had a radio to call EMS at least 🤷‍♂️
Was she okay? 😢
Is momma okay ❤🙏🙏🤗 protect this lil one and his mommav😢
this kid already tells him my mom is in the water and he hesitates and asks is somebody in there, so stupid. that woman is counting seconds
How the hell she drove in there
Why is he moving so slow
Cop what Do  you mean? if she's in there, if somebody is in there ?
Why in the world does he keep asking if somebody's in there?? The child is begging him to save is mama! 😢
I don't understand why the cop was standing there asking questions before immediately reacting! Suppose the person couldn't holler out so that means he wouldn't have gone in? His response was too damn slow for me after a kid is standing there telling you there's a car submerged and then you get there and you're still questioning it which means he didn't quite believe him!
How the hell does someone whip out a phone to record in a huge emergency.
Thank god for the good Samaritans, the cop is too busy asking questions, is she in there? Is the car unlocked? U know she is in there bro, come on!!!
Please post how to rescue someone in such a situation: how do you get them out, how to prevent from drowning yourself?
He asking is someone is in there is mind blowing
Lord!!! How is she doing? Does anyone know? Thank you for all who helped her.
What's fucked up is? They'll pull that gun and shoot when their life's in danger But if somebody else's life is in danger, they won't pull that gun and shoot out the window. They'll sit there and tap on the window with a rock. Thinking that Little Rock's gonna break the window. Right, no, it didn't.
That cop was in idiot why you asking questions jump in to action 😂😂
Is she ok😢❤
Stupid questions. Get in there already.
Is the door unlocked??
Is this cop special ed?
It’s the fact that he is losing more tone asking the dumb question “Is somebody in there.” When the child JUST told him his mom is in there. 🙄
Is she ok😢,, please let her be ok for him, he loves her so much..
If you saw a crocodile 🐊   or alligators 🐊 in distance: would you still have the same eager to help?? 🤔
Could he be any  slower
The cop sure did have a lot of questions
Why did  he ask is somebody in there? He took and you "trained officer" Why would did he ask "is the door unlocked?" GO FIND OUT INSTEAD OF ASKING STUPID QUESTIONS!.
The cop was far toooo slow...cmon.... asking if there is somebody in there or if its the car unlocked...wow...thanks to the other guy... that cop should be in an office no field work
I thought they are not allowed to drive if they have epilepsy
That cop didn't even want to help how u hear a lil boy screaming for his mom n u jis ask if someone's in there wtf
Dumb Question Bruh Just Jump In And Do something!!!
Oh God! Is she ok???
Is she ok??
Why will someone with seizures drive. This is very dangerous
Wasting time by asking stupid questions? The boy is scared to death and in shock! What more do you need? 🙄
Stroll up. Then ask redundant question is she in there. Did you not hear the panicked boy. Smh
My question is how the hell did that car end up in the water ??? 😮 Bravo to the child and the first responders who saved her life. 😇🪖🫂🗣️👋❤️‍🩹😎💯👻👾👼😘🚨💯
⚠️STILL, NOT ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION STATING WHETHER OR NOT THE WOMAN SURVIVED?!?! 🧐
Is somebody in there? 🤔
I wonder if that was her first ever seizure?  If you have a history of them, then it's very dangerous to drive at all.
why didn't that police officer go into the water right away, afraid of wet socks, ridiculous, every second counts
Cop ask 20 questions and then id...we need people that care not FAKE LAW INFORCMENT
Asking multiple times if someone is in the car instead of helping, after the child begs him, is just beyond words..
I guess that cop just didn't want to get wet??.. how many times does someone have too be told directly that theres someone in the car before he stops asking if theres someone in there??!!thank god for the good Samaritan
He asks if the door is unlocked
I'm wondering why she's allowed to drive if she has seizures?
How did the young man get out of the car?😢
Why does he ask if someone is in there when the boy just told him his mom's in there. N why does he walk up, then stand at the bank asking questions. U can tell he was doubting on weather or not to get in there.
Did his mother live??????😢
The cop seemed a little apprehensive if you ask me
Why the hell would she drive a car if she has seizures? You can’t even get a driver’s license. It wasn’t her first because the kid knew exactly what was wrong with her.
😢 Why are they moving so slow to rescue her??
Well, the cop asked if someone was inside enough times.
Why the cop moving slow af....then he wanna pick up speed when he see a man in the water helping
Who asks chilled questions like these when a child who is soaking wet just told you in hysteria that my mom is in there? Then you even have time to shoot a video🙄 Thanks but no thanks😮
Does anyone know if the baby made it?
"Is she in there, is someone in there?" .... i mean he TOLD YOU his mom is in the damn car!?
How did she make out!!! Anyone know? I’m scared for mom and son😢😢❤❤
The trunk of the car was outside still why the heck he wasting time trying to open the door when he could have get through the trunk easier
The fact that he had to ask six different times is someone in there while they're trying to rescue her is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life
Question:  what's hoe?  It used to be that it was a woman who was sexually active with multiple men at once on a casual basis.  But what is a hoe now-a-days?  I feel a woman's "body count" is nobody's business especially if she's been in relationships.
He told the cop she was in the car he kept asking the same question. Help the woman
Why do people post these life and death situations and not give the full story! Don’t post things you can’t corroborate!
Why is she even driving thats against police and doctor orders
Where is the Police
Bet this will not be national news
Did she survive?
How do you accidentally drive into a lake?
How did the boy get out
Did this mother survive for God sakes?
He told s him she's in the water  but he asked again 😮❤ 😂 😢
Asking them dumb ass questions,less talking more action
How did she get in there ???????
"Is she in there?" The dangon child just pointed & said she was having a seizure. Sheesh!!
Thank God they were able to get her out. Any updates? That’s so scary for him and us watching. 😩
How did they get there in the first place 😳!?
Happy to hear Mom is slowly getting better. 🙏🙏 How did the car get in that water?
I live in west orange.  What body of water is this.? I need a back story. 😮
Cop is a bitch..asking questions already answered by the kids struggle
Did she survive
How could she not see the lake?  I get it that someone with a truck could have pushed her in the lake. There are a lot of trucks in Texas being driven by big ego'd texans. I supposed she could have fallen asleep or texting, but you have a lake in front of you.
Wtf you asking if someone is on there , the child said someone was in there when he ran up to you.
The cop asked if someone's in the car after the child told him that his mom IS IN THE CAR.
How did he know she was having a seizure? If she has them I wonder why she’s driving 😢
Why is he asking if somebody’s in there when they’re supposedly sunk
The cop really stood and asked is somebody in there like she gone respond. Seriously use your head officer
“Is someone in there?” 🤔 Glad your humanity stepped in!
Brave kid! That officer was asking too many questions. Is the car unlocked?? I saw a comment that she was in recovery ❤
It's only a question...Should people who knowingly have been diagnosed with "Seizures" be on the road driving? Should she have had a trained dog in there with her at all times? How can we prevent something like this from happening again? Is there any real help or education for persons with seizures who have no other choice of getting around but driving? People with this diagnosis have a very hard time getting on "Disability" despite medical diagnosis. What's your opinion or factual knowledge?
He’s asking is somebody in there? I mean is the car going to drive itself. So the kid just appeared out of nowhere.
How dumb was this cop to see a car turned over & a kid clearly telling you what’s going on… & the cop still asks if anyone is in there!? WTF!!!?
Could the cop move any slower and care any less? Bet if ut was a white kid he would've moved 100xs faster.
Asking is there anyone in there and is the car locked get a real badge smh🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Should people who have seizure disorders be driving??!
Did she live?
cop:Is somebody in there ???
"Is somebody in there"? Jump in and find out rain man.
Question number one: how does he know it’s a seizure? Number two: if mom has seizures often what is she doing behind the wheel?
Is there a positive update on this lady? Bless little man fir asking for help! X
Wtf he asking so many questions 4
If she has seizures what is she doing driving?!! And apparently it's not the first time because that child KNEW what was happening. SMH.
"is she in there?" Naw we just out here pryin open submerged doors for fun. Tf u think?
Is she okay? ❤
Any links for the whole thing? Any updates??
Here is ANOTHER video that stops at the right time that leaves you guessing and wondering what happened!! SMDH!!
😢Is she ok does anyone know? ❤❤❤❤😢
The cop couldn't have cared any less.... tf why did he take so long
Is the mom ok?
Do cops have a tool that breaks down windows in case of an emergency?
Is the case unlocked? I'm confused... why did he ask that?
The cop seriously asking if somebody is in there .....
Is the car unlocked?
Did she survive
Why would any adult drive child when they have seizures?
Why was the cop not running into the water....geez these public servants I swear
I wonder does she have a history of seizures, if so, she may have been abandoned from driving. Feel sorry for this family 😢🙏🏾
So the cop was asking (after the boy told him) Is somebody in there?
Let’s ask 20 questions & take our time rescuing this woman..
wtf did the cop do other then shout if someone was in the water and offer the other person equipment to get the lady out.
I was just wondering if the boot was still locked.   But you have saved them all than goodness you did
Is the car unlocked 🙄. Asking dumb questions. I hope she's ok and bless them for at least tryin
Why it looks like he's moving in slow motion 😮😮
Why first responders don't have a window punch is beyond me.
Is the in there? Is the car unlocked? What a coward..  Jump in ask questions later
Why was dude so slow......
"Is somebody in there?" He already told you his mom was in there... just take ur time......wtf
How patiently does this policeman ask if there is anyone in the car when the child had already told him!! This kind of people make me sick!
My heart breaks for the boy.  Why was the woman driving if she's prone to seizures? Her children's lives are at risk!
Great team work!!!  If that were Ole Frank out in AZ he would demand to see ID first and make sure his camera was recording then ask lady why she decided to drive in pond.
Some of these officers should work customer service or dispatcher jobs with those questions
Is somebody in there?? Dude seriously you expecting her to swin out n say yeah I'm here?? The kid said she was in the water.
What did he mean? Is there somebody in there? The little boy told him somebody was in there he needs to move faster, but thank God he helped her.
And he took way too long asking a bunch of questions what the hell
Could he of acted any slower..
Asking all these questions is somebody in there? Is somebody in it? He already told you that get them out. Help him
Is anyone in there?!! Let me see your hands, don’t reach, don’t move, show me your id
Who the hell gave her the keys?! I swear women can’t drive anything.
I don’t know why im getting suggested clips from a channel I’ve never looked up or subscribed to
The officer is wasting time questioning if someone's in their mother f***** the kid didn't drive the car into the water he clearly told you his mother's in there so quit wasting time
Asking if someone is in there after the kid is yelling for help and a voice is coming from car. Ugh
Why was he so hesitant to go in the water? Why are u gonna ask if she is in there your wasting time in she is was unconscious and can't respond
What happened? Was she saved?
Those are good cops,did the lady survive ???????
Someone please tell me this boy actually kept his mama
Why did the cop take so long to go down there and help her?
Hero Young Man!  What happened to his mom, was she okay?
Is she okay?!
Can he move like he thought a white woman was in there 😡😡
How slow is the cop?
What’s up with his hesitation to save people. Why does he need confirmation that someone is in the car. The kid just told you. Go look bro. Slow ass cop.
What is he asking stupid questions for, wasting precious time
I mean, good on the cop but Jesus….could he have moved any effing slower?
Could he waddle any slower? Damn
