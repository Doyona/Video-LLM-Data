what does the text say?
What is that..??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What were they given at the end of the video?
Baby? No baby on the stage. Just Holy Pope Lasagna.
Has this audience been sedated by Olly Alexander?
I dont say the song and vibe are bad. But same time  this is show event, or music? I like the music, not just melody...
why can't people just enjoy rather than a sea of phones ??
Käärijä, what has happened to you during this year
What happens with his Voice?
Is that traditional clothes for men?
This outfit or the red vest one? Now im torn 😩 don't know which one i prefer. Which one you guys think he should wear at the contest?
Do you think he could've imagined, when his song was one of the reserve options for Dora 2024, that a few months later he'd be hearing his song sung back at him by huge crowds in Madrid and London? Life comes at you fast, and I hope he's enjoying the ride, no matter how he does in Malmö. Best wishes from NYC!
People are going on about the vocals, what is he meant to be doing in this song with the vocals. These are the best ones so far
