who wore it better?
What is that white racquet Opelka's using??? Did he give up on pro staff?
Is Djokovic wearing those Asics shoes?
did opelka switch racquets or just a different paint?
Wait, why am I seeing pickleball highli.... oh, never mind, GMP and Opelka are just so huge they make it look like they're on a pickleball court.
Why do players put their hands through their wet hair then shake hands?
Where is his so new couch Andy Murray?
Opelka needs to figure out how to break serve as it puts way to much pressure on his service game. Figure out how to be a better defender then he might be able to break through
Monfils how can you not atleast win one match after 20 smh
What's the gretaest record: 25 GS or beating the same top 100 guy 20 times?  Monfils had lost the game the moment he learnt who he had to play against 😂
Was Opelka injured for the past year? I have been wondering why he disappeared.
Showman Tiafo got smashed again?
Opelka found his inspiration in Cast Away?
Djokovic H2H with Monfils is 20:0. How is that even possible?
Didn't he retire?
why do tiafoe and mpetshi always wear the same clothes😂
