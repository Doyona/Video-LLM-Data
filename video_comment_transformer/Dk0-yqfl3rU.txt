What's the name of the first song please ? Love it ❤
Am i the only one who would prefer Openda
seems like he does most of his best work in transistion. Would he still be effective in a team like arsenal that holds a ton of possesion?
We need a striker who can score nearly 20 goals a season for us. Can he do that?
He's good but the question is will he survive the  EPL
Where’s his van bastenesque goal?
Genuine question, what happens with G.Jesus? Presuming just rotating?
Has it been confirmed though? Cos i thought he was going to ac milan?
am trying to think of what will become of arsenal if you have Saka Sesko and Rashford
has he signed? or is this just another video to stink up arsenal searches on youtube
I still don't know whether he is left or right footed
Is this confirmed??
Im not sure, we need more of a flare player
He looks sick. But will he be a 20-goal-a-season striker?
Is he a done deal  yet
Already have Havertz seems like a similar player?
the new Scamacca?
How is Arsenal going to play him and Havertz?
