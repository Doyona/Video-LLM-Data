How is no one talking about koula scoring the game winning try by himself
Can Manly beat Roosters and then Storm to make it to the GF?
Nothing against bulldogs they dominated Manley the whole game but anyone else love seeing Crichton loose?
Fan of neither team.. why didn’t DCE get penalised for dragging the player down after that Mahoney hit? Tough call with that haumolo contest too.
