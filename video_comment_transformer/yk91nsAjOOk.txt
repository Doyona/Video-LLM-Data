So informative, but What is your conclusion?
Does Trump actually understand economics??? or any sort of common sense??
There’s a lot of context that this video left out, so very biased against Tariffs. If Tariffs are bad then why does almost every country in the world use it? Are their leaders bad too?

Question: what is the difference between recession vs depression?
