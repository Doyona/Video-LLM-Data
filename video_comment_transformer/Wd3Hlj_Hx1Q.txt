What a vexing situation.
Starter base??
Is anyone else glad that they don’t see the DLJ Mario guy or whatever his name is because every video I watch he’s there
How about the jellie train?
Maybe “Scarzia Hermitopia National Zoo” is a good name, or just “Scarzia” idk, hope you like it tho! (hehe that rhymed)
Potential name (idk if it’s been suggested, but I don’t see it in comments I’ve seen):   Scar’s Magnificent Magical Menagerie
Scar-borough Fair Zoo?
Does anyone know the name of the song that plays in the background from 16:00 until 20:00?
Who's gonna control the Poe Poe? Look... we have Grian who doesn't finish the backsides of builds and Scar who doesn't place torches.... But worst of all, the Poe Poe headoffice didn't have an interior at the 2nd of august. That's unexceptable! :P ;)
episode 22.... finishing the STARTER BASE.... when does a starter base become a mega base?
1:48 Why’d I think of Zoo-choo?😂
This must be the feeling of getting high on ketamine and meth. This had me wondering that if I had dumped my body in the flowing currents of the river below me no one would ever come and save to resuscitate me back from the dead. It's one of those intimate moments where I would feel most likely to be alive than dead in these unbelievable and unfavorable kind of circumstances.
I know it was a third party thing but curious if there's any update on the scarland art book that we ordered back in April and it still hasn't released/delivered
how about Minecraft National Park Zoo.
Zoo time with scar?  Scary animals? Scar's scarce/secret/scary/sacred sanctuary/zoo?  Good animals with scars? 😅 The Hermitcrabs home/house  eSCARgo's shellter?  Scars sneaky snails..

Anybody else: surely impounding shops cannot be legal? Scar and Skizz: it is, but it's necessary.

scar what bamboozles me... is how can u NOT know swords do sweeping edge damage as default unless u jump crit.... use an axe man 🤦‍♀
Scarland Zoo?
Scar.. can you please stop being purposefully dumb? We know you’re actually quite good at the game, it’s so obvious you’re trying to be chaotic and wacky but it’s just frustrating when you keep dying/killing hermits intentionally.
Has Mumbo had that waffle since season 8?
Concentration camp for pop up shops? Didn’t think that one too far through huh
Is this war? I want war
What about Redwoods Reserve?
Why isn't YOUR terracotta popup shop in the graveyard?

An idea for the zoos name… Zoolandia ?
What about the terracotta shop? Wasn't that a pop-up.
Is it ok that you didn't build anything? Are you kidding? We love the chaos! Bring more chaos! LOL
Anyone know who changed the billboard? Lmao poor cub
Anyone know who changed the billboard? Lmao poor cub
Omg do like a Lion King reference, well the land in the movie is called the Pride Lands, maybe do something with that idk. The reason for doing a Lion King reference is because scar is called scar and there is a scar in the movie, you know?

Whats the name of the track playing while scar is fighting the magic hands man in the background

Starter base? STARTER BASE???  Scar! Please leave some building for the other hermits!

How about Scartopia instead of Zootopia?
I dunno, man.. that redesigned glass collective still looks like a bunch of separate popshops with no floor, ceiling or walls between them. The poe poe shouldn't be fooled by it.
When will we have a stat poker episode?? 😃
What about ‘Scar-topeya’
How about you name it the "Starter Base Zoo"
Jevin starting a war? :D
Call the zoo the “Scarfari”?
Wat was going on in Xisumas base? I'm completely lost.
What is a soccer?
You could name the zoo Scar Park or Scartopia
Ya know, we haven’t seen cOW in a really long time. If he’s lost or dead, can we name the zoo in his honor? It does rhyme. The cOW Memorial Zoo
