Can you imagine Dobes beating another Standley cup cham  Washington ??
JT Miller must of heard the chatter from the Canucks radio guys they were killing him yesterday and Petterson being out it makes you wonder
I watched the game and it looked like after the last goal there was something being reviewed. I saw the goalie reaction here but still no idea what they were contesting. Anyone know?
With Fowler in the pipeline , the best trade for Hughes be Montambault ...let 's add Savard , Dvorak and perhaps Armia to that list too..But Evans is a perfect center, well liked in the locker room  and a fan's fav . Why trade him?
Is Caufield the smallest player in NHL? what he lack in size is made up in skill, very good skillful player.
