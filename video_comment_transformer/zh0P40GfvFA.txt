Why tf does South Africa got to do with this?bro just randomly put our flag in the music video
Baby how you gonna snatch something from him as pac and pac smoked?🙈😂😂😂
Anyone know what brand that flower belt from?

Yall think this better than they not like us??
Who id he supposed to be 2Pac?😂
Where's the old nle
checkers on the floor ??
hey yo, didn’t you do that song called “slv t me out”??
fxck nle this shit diss for YB  all peoaple tink YB songs best  This song is meaningless, everyone chooses their own  🥶
After shotta flow and shotta flow remix idk wtf happened to this man and no not saying his music trash but he changed into this new industry image and it ain’t a cool image and he ain’t the only rapper who changed once they touched big money and became a industry guy
Bro wtf is this? Yall like this type of sht? We cooked
Was that meant to be nba 💀
Can people stop saying he sampled “hit em up” by tupac. Eric b & rakim used the beat first on “paid in full”. And they sampled  it from Dennis Edwards “dont look any further”
wtf is this 😂
Bro who tf call Tupac??
I’m not mad at the visuals or the choreography …… I just don’t think it fits for a diss record.
😂 is that a DeathRow chain
Damn where tf this dude come from
Who’s gonna tell him ts buns?
Wtf did I just watch lmfaoooooo
Bro I’m from Jamaica 🇯🇲 can you help us it was a storm killing us last message before Wi-Fi go out again
Micheal Jackson?
maybe i’m out the loop but when they start beefing ?😅
idk the context so i’m just like damn… what did that nigga do to make the gooch monster so mad?
where is his outfit from?
So nobody caught the Zohran Mamdani reference here? South Africa is where Mamdani went to school and Uganda is where he was born, and now he’s the mayor of NYC. If you look at 2:08 you’ll see the two country flags, it could mean NLE shows his support to the new mayor, very subtle though, not many will catch that.
Bro, why are you being jealousy bro? You’re just jealous because young boy is going famous and you’re quiet, so maybe you should’ve made more songs and nobody really likes you. No more you you’re not even you’re not even trending. No more bro.
Who still listening in 2025?
What's with the other country flags? Is he trying to merge the other tribes into black American business like monaleo tried to do? I'm just wondering
Is this the next Michael Jackson?
What’s up with the checker board tho?
Ok , but why is he dancing ?
Who’s back today 😂
Yo somebody find the lyrics to this song🔥🔥🔥
Honest question: Is he blaspheming? English isn’t my first language and especially with his accent I can’t understand everything perfectly. In the beginning when he’s running he says „YHWH“ in his breath which is the name of the Lord and later in 0:26 I don’t understand what he says about Jesus and the devil and someone who is king. Can someone help? Hope he’s not trying to make fun of Jesus! God bless
Was he dissing NBA Yb?
Why the South African flag ? Just wondering
Why would NLE Diss YB
Is he on drugs 😳
What in the ripoff Tupac is this 😂
Why he drop that wack ahh song😂
Young Boy where is the big boy ? 😂😂😂
Can anybody here who's honest enough to admit that they're an NBA Youngboy fan tell me how you think NLE the Great  isn't the better lyricist and overall artist?   I don't listen to today's young from-the-streets rap artists because quite frankly their music is trash and (NBA Youngboy is the most absolutely overrated artist that I'm aware of), so I wasn't familiar with NLE the Great either, but I can say he puts thought into his lyrics and in this video he showed fearlessness in expression.   I will never understand what the noise around NBA Youngboy is all about.
What the actual heck did I just watch!
Wtf is this 😂 a 1960s version of hit em up ? Sound and production is legendary!
What does young boy gotta say tho ? 😂 This shits hard af 🎉
just curious what did Nba younger do?
Is that a South African flag 🇿🇦
Am I right in saying this feels like hopsin flow ?
How you make a Diss acting zest in the video? I guess it worked.

What the hell is this song about?
Hold up this might be me, but does anyone else sorta hear the beat to "Hit 'Em Up" by 2pac? Rhythmically I keep picking it up and sometimes the flow begins to match. NLE really is on another level Edit: Played the 2 back to back, yeah, that bassline was most definitely inspired by or taken from Hit 'Em Up.
Why is it 2hours long😢😢 still can't get enough
Wtf is everyone saying this was creative when everything is jacked from others even down to the beat and clothes!he created nothing but a problem for his self as if his career wasn't already bad! nothing about this was original or creative! creative would definitely have something to do with that word original 😂😂😂😂😂😂
New Tupac?

One on one boxing match.. WHO IS WINNING?
Didn’t blue face show evb that NLE a fake gangster

Like does he really think this is a good song? Does he know his garbage or what I would’ve been laughing hard as hell I was young boy.
What is he talking about in this song and what is this dancing in the ball head and the gyrating of his hips this man is fool fool do do
Ppl saying it is hypothetical yes he was rapping the same as yb but he's rlly saying he mature n yb still rapping the same shit n putting out for von ❤ rip von but yall need to study deeper to rap and music to understand the whole picture
Who else saw the Ugandan flag
Are yall hearing him though!!??
You wasted a great video on a dis record?!!!
What u go do if u get sued like drake did Kendrick. What u go do if they buy yo contracts 😂. Yo YouTube check going to never broke again. But I doubt they worry bout suing. Some other rappers woulda sued u
They beefing lol ?!?
This weird how you dvk ride a man then he don’t wanna fwy you do this and you on some disrespectful shit not even a message now when them boys k!ll yo ass it’s something smh
Tupac all eyes on me (single) sample?
Why he got uganda n S.A flags in the back? Anyone know?
What got in to you
Hmm why do I like this smh.....
If u go make a diss come way better especially a yb diss?? Dude wtff
This guy drop a tab of acid or something? Wasn't he just singing about percocets and one night stands?
The video is beautiful visually, lyrics ehh. I don’t understand why he’s targeting young boy, and  not all rappers, who paved the way, with derogatory lyrics, drug use and violence. He could have collabed with positive rappers, I see people making comments like we need this…. When Kendrick, drake and j Cole was beefing and j Cole a positive, talanted rapper apologized publicly and said he wouldn’t engage people were talking bad about him. Yb a product of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Bird man is his mentor, this video is more of a threat than positivity. There are active post about other rappers putting hands on women. The hype for this is weird. When we have talanted positive rappers who have been positive but ppl saying we need this, this video is bs lyrics and violent. Carrying his head, whipping him with a belt, I don’t understand the goal.
I was wondering when he was going to respond for von
How do you make a diss song about a man you try so hard to be like 😂
new era... does this mean RIP gangsta choppa??
Show me a token
Show me a token

Didn’t expect this but it’s fire! The question is are you ready and prepared for war?
are you the one who made shotta flow??
either YB responds because he has an album coming out, or this is superfluous. I respect diss tracks existing, but it's not as poppin' as Pac dissing Bad Boy Ent. or even most recently Kendrick and Drake. old head signing out
Bro, is this a dis on youngboy
Y’all really thought this was a good song? 😂😂 definitely has numbers on it but if we’re being realistic it’s because he dissed YB so people are only coming to the vid to hear the diss but nobody in these comments be saying play that new NLE 😂😂
Where’s the 🚮 button?
Could this be the NLE that released "Shotta Flow"?

Okay I have a question. I've always heard the anything music or anything that uses imagery or talks about the same type of violence that regular music or anything talks about even if it's about destroying the devil if you're using that same energy talking about or insinuating violence it's still of the devil
Who’s flow is at 2:20? It’s bugging me that i don’t know it haha
This shit is creative, but I don’t know if you wanna be a gay gangsta , wanna be Michaela  or Tupac, or a pornstar or rapper. Ain’t no self respecting dude gonna watch or listen to this twice
so nle how its different when u do it?
Do you actually expect us to dance to this
Why am i seeing south African and Ugandan flag in the music video😅
What the fuck is this
Why the six sign in the beginning?
What's our Ugandan flag doing there 😅
I don’t know is he trying to be like two pack or something?
Songs ok but what’s with the dissing? Didn’t know he had an issue with nba. And why diss an artist who is way bigger and better? The music today last for like 3 weeks when I’m still listening to music and albums from the 80s 90s and 2000s. I miss when music use to touch your soul now it’s all about viral moments that won’t last I wish this new generation will start to make the music touch your soul again

I'm lost.....is this a diss or a parody?🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Personally, I think the music video and song are creative and catchy. But one thing I have to ask — does it glorify God? Bro doesn’t believe Jesus Christ is God — the King of Kings and Lord of Lords — and this song, like his last one, is a reflection of that. There’s no Holy Spirit behind it. Take the message how you will. May the Lord remove the scales from his eyes, mine, and all of mankind’s.
What’s bro even saying
Is this parody I’m confused
Why ts hard😭?
🤔 did I miss something 😂
What the fu k is that
Am I the only one who wants to see how he would do on film? He’s so animated and high energy, he’s fun to watch. Rap wise he uses real words so I love it…
