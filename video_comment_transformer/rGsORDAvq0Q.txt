We had a quiz that was for 10 marks my classmate got 9/10 and she was like I did sooo bad when I studied so haird and got a 3/10😭
Imagen if the minimochi got 67 marks😂😂😂😂😂
Why didn't you put 67 instead of 69
In my class a kid scored 50/50 in math and when I checked her paper and mam marked the last question write while it was wrong the worst part is it was a 5 mark question if she got it wrong i would have been class topper with 49.5/50
What is the name of this movie
If he's the nerd then why he is crying over 99 score
BTW, is it 69 number or a position 😅😅
But why 69 😂
Wht is 69?
That was me on my math test i wasss.soo sad i studied for days and lost 1 mark , the worst part is that is was A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTION. Idk it jus hurt me soo bad
Did anybody noticed class clown masrks 💀
Me: is that me?
Isn't anyone talking about the class clowns score 69????
Is David Indian
The main problem is  Can't decide whether to mourn that 1 mark Or celebrate the 90
How is the exam paper only one page😂😂😂
Why the heck was the last nerd overreact over a 99
The class nerd is a Asian?
The nerd is basically me when I get 1 question wrong or a score of a 99
What is wrong with the nerd
How can 99 be tagged as being so bad
The cry got meeeee 😂 And who noticed  the dhadkan BGM in the end?
The nerd be like: Why do I always get 99? What will happen when I go home?  😅😅😅I am the onne who gets 97 always 😅
Wth is this 😂
They don't know how much worked for that one mark
Am I the only one that thinks 100% is not high enough
Bro what is the joke with 69
Is tha bollywood song😅
Does someone get what is 69😅 Me seeing a person who doesn't know : Nah hits soo hard 😅
The real reason could be they’re forced. Their parents try and make them perfect. Every mistake they make their parent judge them.
i just got 2/15on my summative test am i cooked?
JIANHAO TAN REFERENCE???????
Isn’t a 60 failing
Did anyone notice about the 69 joke?
The correct answer is time  Wrong answer = exam mein Ande means zero marks
WHY ISN'T ANYONE TALKING ABOUT “THE SCORE”? 👽
Where is my 1 mark
Who knows her family?..
Wasn’t 60% pass?
I was confused, still kinda am bc idk what grading scale this is. i saw 60 and was like "passed?!?!?!?"
What do you mean that's bad that's good😅😅😅😅😅🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊
In 99 we only see that we left 1 question. If we have worked a little bit harder then we could have get 100 marks
Why is she so frustrated 😅

But no one knows what’s behind that one mark…
Does wth mean what the heck of what the hell? Tell me in my comments

I think i got the curse of 69 because i always see the number 69 all the time everyday like Is this unlucky or this is an actual curse for me. Like has anyone else had this or is it just me?
Really ? Stereotyping hardworking, smart and curious people as nerd and showing them cry at every lost mark . They work hard for it and they know HE/SHE WAS DESERVING.
Why do that😂😂99!?
People are taking "crying on 99 mark"as a joke they don't understand how it feels like we work hard day and night to get full marks I got 97%on my semester exam and I felt very sad even after getting it only toppers will understand the value of that 2%/1% and still people make fun of that are we a joke for you guys? 🙂
Did every class nerds wear glasses? I didn't know about that..

When you study 24/7 for days and nights sacrifice everything just to study your happiness your comfort ,everything...and still not get enough marks how would you feel?......was i not good enough? Was all my work not good enough?..all my hardwork and patience...was that not enough?..........exactly that's how we feel......
Honestly, I'm no nerd but if I got 99 I'd get so angry Like, what did that point go for?
am i the only one here a nerd like that and cries?
Why is it always the girl ?
the 69 score!?💀
51 pass??? If you want to pass here it has to be 65-78 cause some classes 65 some 75 some 78 most of the time 75😢
Nahh me whyyyyy Not them indirectly pointing at me when they showed the one that lost one mark and cried

The nerd one I feel it too cuz it's was if you only get 1 question wrong that's literally so sad😢
Who else noticed Dhadkan background music at the end
And her Asian dad would ask her: where did the 1 mark go?
Why do I feel like.... it's about me?!?😂....when u r so used of getting high marks then even when getting 1&2 marks less makes me feel as if my whole life collapsed or my career is over ...etc etc
Is it just me who heard dhadkan music ??????😂😂😂😂💜💜💜
~Maybe the girl with 99 out of 💯 made a careless mistake which made her lost the one mark and her mother is probably asian and will smack her with the slipper? -Or does she think her marks are not good enough or she just wanted pity??? 😭 Who knows? Anything can be possible honestly....
Am I the only one who noticed dhadkan BGM in the end
