When has Dallas had a GREAT defense since 2016??? When have they had a run defense...at all? What year were they not a most penalized team since 2016?? When? Yet Shady is still stuck on stupid blaming Dak for Dallas' failures. WTF. Smh.
Some people want to know why it’s never daks fault. ?? He Can play horrible time a time again. Still blaming someone else.. one day some will come to realize. Dak isn’t the guy .
That defense needs a defensive tackle otherwise I think they might be ok if Dak stays healthy and their offensive line is okay
Once a hater always a hater, everytime he is ask a question, he changes the question and deflect. Cant get a striaght yes or no answer about Dallas being a better geam now.
Trade deadline? What can fix then? Middle of the D?
Dakota isn't the COWBOYS ! So just answer the question Shady!
How are you the most balanced with no run game 🤔
Who throwing him the ball tho
Didn't Pickens have 6 drops last season?
Wait he play rb or o-lineman?
Question for Shady McCoy.....How well did Jalen Hurts and the Eagles perform in big game situations BEFORE the acquisition of Saquan Barkley? He was good but the addition of Barkley took their offense to another level. Give Dallas and Prescott the same grace that was extended to the Eagles and Hurts!!!
What happened to the white  dragt prospects woken heimer . And of course will mcclay didn't draft any same thing as last year white player are a endangered species . On this woke Boyz . Organization sys thematically eliminating them off the team bias abounds. . 🐺👀
Don't u need a offense line to give dak time ask mahomes how,did that work out for him
Is McCoy still on this show.....  I'll check back in a month...  he's useless and the world's biggest hater
Where was this great defense shady talking about 😂
Who F*cked Joy Taylor on this panel?
Shady just a hater lol stay on the agenda, stay on topic, answer the question on what the take is about.
Is shady mentally disabled ???
Where’s joy @?????
Ringo 😂😂😂 Star?
What’s Pickens off the field problems?
So the defense getting 45 dropped on them was on #4 ?
Just like his quarterback Hurts did until they got Barkley right?
Cowboys still don’t have a running back?
I am curious.  How did the Cowboys afford a balanced offense with Dak making 60 mil?  How did the Eagles win the Super Bowl with Hurts making $51 mil?  Everyone is dissing on Purdy getting $50 mil plus shutting the Niners out of the Super Bowl.
what's this George Pickens "off the field" issues?
How many wins dose Fak Trashcott has against good teams vs bad teams in the past 8yrs? He has a bad record vs good teams and definitely a worst record against back to back victories vs good teams.And guess what? In the playoffs there are only good and great teams! That's why he loses every time in the playoffs!
What is Jerry Jones job? To give those "Talking Heads" something to Talk about.   There for Jerry has done a Great job again this year.
Is it me, or does that Acho guy over exert unnecessary words and enthusiasm into this show? Every sentence it sounds like he's trying.. takes away from the show with those horribly long sentences and soliloquies
Balanced??? suspect at both OT, uncertainty at TE, RB1 coming off injury may not regain form, 2 new RB are untested late round picks, Miles Sanders  probably doesnt make the roster, new coach, new line coach, new play book and aging QB coming back from another injury...
Some time I wonder if Dak smashed shady’s girl. This dude hates Dak for no reason 🤦🏿‍♂️
Can yall have a segment on next years qb class???
shady was a mediocre rb, why is he even on this platform?
Let me know when cowboys defense can stop the run which is their biggest weakness
Lol this move aint going to do nothing!! Do they have tom brady? Can they stop the run , u can keep there offense off the field by just running the ball 😂😂😂  can they stop the run
Who’s Them Boys QB again?? 😂😅😂
Still the cowboys, well have to wait and see
Shady is a Hater.  Pickens is better than Gallup and probably Amari and definately better than everything else there not counting what the rookies might show. The lineman are going to be better.  What is still a question is the Defense.  If the Defense stop the run the Cowboys will win 11 or 12 games.  The run game gotta be there too.  When Dak went 13-3 his rookie year, the defense lost the playoff games more than Dak did.
Still go be eagles commanders an idk between cowboys n giants
I want to ask LeSean McCoy does the team the Cowboys play in the playoffs matter are the 49ers and the Green Bay Packers the two playoff wins at Prescott does have was against the Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay that's a question I think that somebody's guys should have asked who Prescott and the Cowboys play in the playoffs matter
What's w are they now? They have always been them same old cowboys for 30 years.
They've had great teams in the past and did nothing, what's different now?
How about them Cowboys 🏉
Most balanced? You forget that you have no RB?
acho be making no sense .. like they have no run game … but have a balanced offense ???
I wonder what/who Daks idiotic supporters will blame when the scrub chokes PER USUAL...😂...i swear Dak apologists are the most ignorant people in sports
Did they get a running game that we don't know about. I can name many teams that are way more balanced. That's the dumbest hot take
Steelers got rid of him .hmmmmmmmm😂
Is the thing that kills me about you guys as a cowboy fan you guys love to do this kind of stuff first you'll say that's the problem but is that really a problem
Why are they telling them lies!
Cowboys oline is stout?
What about Phil Mafah?
But can we stop the run?
We need to give Joe Milton a good amount of snaps this pre season since there’s so much doubt around Dak, get him comfortable and allocated early in case there’s a fall of with #4.
Do they actually pay shady for his garbage
But still don't have a good qb
How you going to have a balanced offense and not have a tight end?
Who’s your qb still? 😂
Great defense? Before injuries maybe. We didn't have line backers vs green bay. We are way better off now, all helping Dak
Since when is sanders a receiving back?
With what Running back? And what left tackle? The rookie hasn’t even taken a snap at RG yet….do we just print Yellow Jackets cause of paper these days??? Give me a break.
Tell me how many wins Hurts would have had without his RB.
What did shady do in the playoffs?
Pickens is perfect as Dallas needs a receiver but can shotty put this all together and keep the personality issues from getting out of hand I wish him great success in his career.
How are they going to pay him next year
balanced offense with who at rb again?
Tell me what Oline Dak has had to give him confront to let it go🤔
Why do you think that the Steelers practically gave you Pickens for free?😂
Did I just hear James Jones say Ringo instead of Mingo 😂
How wheres the run game? Hows that balanced 😂😂😂
Cowboys defense was good 2 years ago, if anything that was our year, now I don’t know, this was a good move but we will see though
Anytime Shady says, “what are we talking about here” you know its about to get real 😂
Idk, the Steelers usually are pretty good at moving a WR at the right time.
If we put Jalen Hurts or Dak Prescott with the Carolina Panthers, who will have more success?
Shady knows what’s good 😂best man to ask bout Cowgirls 😂
Does cook just not exist he was good too
I don’t get it, why is shady less excited than the others?
Bro how many great teams can you give a QB like really do yall not remember they had the most all pros yet got spanked 😂 not like they had great offense year after year yet got nothing in return for the money the owner put out 😂😂😂😂
Is he gonna play without an extension and how much cancer does he bring with him
Anyone else also skip past Acho?
Now, if you can stop the run in the 4th quarter.
What off the field stuff?
So when Dak chokes in the playoffs who gets the blame???? Lol
Who is Ringo??? Lol 🤣🤣
Lmao Micheal Gallup?
How much money does Jerry pay the networks to keep talking like this team is anything to worry about? Let's talk about relevant teams
My question is this, how did Jalen Hurts look before the acquisition of receiver AJ Brown? The Eagles were comparing his performance to Dak Prescott’s performance and actually didn’t think he was the best QB for them until AJ Brown showed up.
idk where Acho is getting Tyler Guyton as an all pro.  That would be great, but that's as much a stretch right now as Herbert to the HOF
how is the offense balanced when there is little to no proven running game
Is anyone else getting tired of Shady and his arrogant, condescending energy? Like he really thinks because he had the best career of all of them he can move a certain way, like talking too much and talking over the others and etc. It's getting annoying...
Disappointed in Shady’s take. Are we not allowed to be excited for any regular season games? It’s not like those 18 weeks are don’t exist. Lose  lose for any cowboys take.
Why do they never talk about the negatives? There is a reason why Pittsburgh was happy to say goodbye to this WR.
Can someone name me the Cowboys Offensive Coordinator?
How are they balanced? With no run game?
What do Mcoy do in the playoffs
Why does Shady hate on Dak so much ??
Pickens is a problem on the sideline.Ask yourself why Pittsburgh didn't give him an extension. Remember that game in December how Pickens acted on the sidelines. Better yet the more Dallas throws the more their at risk of turning over the ball with Dak throwing.
10-12 wins where? 😅😅😅 You got the eagles and Washington just in the division not to mention the nfc north this year with the afc west schedule 😅😅😅8-9 @ best 😅
They bugging. They have no run game.
So no excuses is what I’m hearing?
Did they forget who the Quarterback was?
Is this the same guy who quit on the Steelers ?13:40
What run game do they have? Where’s the defense? MAN, please!!!
If George Pickens was in this draft does he go number 1?🧐
Who’s throwing to these receivers??
Name another team with a blocking catching TE a top 5 receiving corp powerbacks and receiving backs run and pass blocking offensive line? Ummm the Eagles?
Has Pickens matured? Have the Cowboys changed their losing zoo culture? No and no? Go birds
Cowboys have good personnel on offense but do you trust their HC & OC to put them in a position to succeed? Do you trust Dak to get it done when it matters most? 🤷🏾‍♂️ We shall see
Here's the problems when acho asked what teams has all the things he asked.... Not many but the teams that do are teams that are in their division that are better than them😂
Damn Shady, did Dak steal your girl or something? The HATE seems VERY PERSONAL 🤔🤔🤔
How is George Pickens worth 3-4 extra wins????? I think it’s a great move for Dallas don’t get me wrong, but if you thought they’d win 7-8 games, how does Pickens get them to 11-12????
Who's the QB, Dak?   1, 2, 3 cancun
Defense against packers?
Let's see if Pickens can play and not stand around on the field every other play
Real question is, will Dallas pay Pickens $30M+
why is he on this show shady
If your the Steelers why wouldnt you do this pre draft 😏
The DT tackle postion and LB and head coach still all question marks
