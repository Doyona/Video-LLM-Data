Try interviewing a Pakistani General
27.26 Is that Dominik Mysterio? 😂
Why this guy been invited?
Bro was like: Come on man, this wasn't the question I paid you to ask. :(
Who is watching after he remanded?
Is Mehdi trying to give him a heart attack?😂
What a joke of a prime minister he was for Sri Lanka. Such an arrogant man who can’t answer what is being asked. Typical subcontinent politicians answers.
Killing boss @ Batalande Ranee housing scheme?
Thuggery ex prez Batalande raniya comedian?
Oh isn't this 'my friend' guy? Did the TV company grab a random man from the street to be the tv presenter?
The interviewer was terrible. He asks a question and when Ranil gives a brilliant answer he cuts him off. That's disgusting. And he keeps misquoting Ranil. This is Aljazeera.
Ranil wicrmasingha is shaking, hands & body, for the Al Jazeera medi Hassan question ❓  Well done ❤❤
Mehdi is an irritating idiot who likes asking questions without waiting for an answer.
Why these so called English clowns claps before get an answer and not after that??
Is mehandi really understand what journalism actually is? Lol
Why does south asian politicians crumble on most basic questions
My dear Brothers and Sister from Sri Lanka. Yes for a common man like you and me it's painful to see corrupt politician and we need answer for their actions.  My message to you, do not let over appreciate outsiders (this channel) for such questions..He is not interviewing he is interrogating to highest rank person of respected and sweetest country Sri Lanka. Not respectful.  This would give blowfire to outsider to deal in internal matter of Sri Lanka.  I see there are lot of people who are appreciating Hassan. This is not the way of talking to the guest.
What kind of anchor he is ?? He is not allowing him to talk!
Islamic Radical Sympathiser asking Questions???
Why is he smiling when asked about Batalanda?
Bro didn't expect these questions to be asked, he was thinking that this is going to be a play time instead, got what we were looking for! Such a child
The question from the audience member at 43:17 is 💯
Can you invite Venancio Mondlane or a Rep of Mozambique's Frelimo Party?  No one has held the Frelimo party accountale for the economic decline (including the Debt scandal) of Mozambique..
Still struggle to understand why CNN sacked Mehdi Hasan
Is this full interview video or edited video.?
how did he even become a president with his childish nature ???
Why wasting time interviewing morons?
Only questioning… no chance to answer. Where’re the basic manners of journalism? 😂😂
Busted 🤣🤣Next Question please
Not a Ranil fan, but Hasan is insufferable!   Not letting a guest to answer your question reveals a hidden agenda…
Questions are all good. But a person should be allowed to answer as well. I felt this is just one-sided.
Topic is something else, questions 😀😀😀, can see lots of ltte supporters are in it , first u should allow him to answer,
Tamil people what happened tell me . ranil?
who protect thief?
Was this idiot running your country ?
What happened to Jaffna library ? 😂
Can you interview or talk about migrant worker camp in Qatar?
Why is this guy so scared of Americans ? When they did so much but never interview them 😅
19:09   Mr. Ranil shouldn’t use Buddha’s words to dodge the Easter attacks question. It’s a serious issue, and people deserve a clear answer, not a clever story. He needs to face the facts, not act too wise to care.
Same type of questions can't be asked to their own governments but easy to question others and feel great questioner or great job doing for this episode
Did any panel members receive funds from USAID ?
Can you also invite Anura next time? Oh please also send along a translator for him 😂
This is a bad interview. It's not dialogue, it's interrogation. Regardless of this man's conduct, this is an embarrassment to journalism, it's way to aggressive and he lost composure. He could have achieved the same goal, with composure.
Where is  the money?????
Is it okay to distrupt someone in the middle of speaking?? Idk why the interviewer  is doing that??
Where is the UN now? @beholdisraelchannel
We really appreciate Mr.Mahadi asking nice questions from Ranil Rajapake
Question Namal Rajapakse,That will be fun too.
Hahahaha al jazeera why are you deleting comments that are criticizing your journalist & this interview. And why are you deleting comments which are clearly showcasing the real truth behind this agenda? . You guys are deleting comments that are not supporting to you. This has happened to many commentators now. Clear bias journalism with hidden agendas.
He faced a real interview in his life. Unlike SRI LANKA the question paper is out and prepared.
What bullshit question is this journalist?
From now onwards Mehedi Hasan will be my favorite journalist who has a back bone to question this culprit Ranil.....love from Sri Lanka❤❤❤Thabk you Mr. Mehedi for pin point him which none of anyother journalist couldnt do so far.Respect
Beside Ranil's corruption, complete failure to get control of situations and leading country to failure, not been asked difficult questions, or not having clear answers to ANY of the questions, this is an utterly ugly example of modern day journalism. Mehdi is bullish towards the interviewee, topping his own questions multiple times, continuously interrupting, without giving a chance even to complete a sentence. They come with an agenda to 'expose' 'war crimes' done by 3rd world countries, grill the powerless countries until they get the answer they wanted. I would invite you to also also talk about the damage done by LTTE, or better yet question Trump, Obama or Tony Brair using the same tone! What a disgraceful display.
What's wrong going to birthday party? They must be relatives. Keep personal connections and politics serpetate please
Ok,,get back to the question 😂😂😂
What about the all the atrocities the LTTE committed?? War is not unilateral, both sides are guilty of humanitarian crimes.  He is the only guy that tried to broker a 2 state solution.
Ask a question, refuse to let the man talk, throw a tantrum when he's not giving you the answer you wanted. Journalism 101 🤣
One of the worst interviewers granted the former president did avoid and deflect answers when convenient. When a question is asked allow an uninterrupted answer at-least for a minute before rebuttal. This is the mockingbird style media reporting and questions where the loudest voice appears to have won the debate And an interview is not a debate but a journey of discovery of the interviewee and the revelation of truths. This joker of a so called journalist is from the leftist propaganda machine.
Why does Mehdi Hasan's face look like "always constipated"?
Why didn’t Ranil ask help from MANAWAMMA
How many millions of dollars did you take to set up Ranil?
How are they still alive?
As usual blabbering useless stuff, whats the point of that Buddhist story ????
Victoria Dam for Electricity  añd agricultural  help to sri Lanka  by Queen.  Elction  cost bud visiting  cost 0,005%  know?
This is so disrespectful  for a country’s ex president . Interviewer should allow Mr. Ranil to answer for his questions. This is more like an interrogation than an interview.
Syrian Moslems massacre thousands of Alawite Moslems...why are you silent? You scream every time a Gazan is killed, but nothing about the Alawites forced to crawl like dogs and then get shot dead??
Please call Gota for an interview and ask how he managed to win the war in 2009 please Mehidi Hassan
I wonder if they would release any bts. *eats popcorn*
Those werent even hard / unexpected questions, Ranil just got emotional and became a joke
What is the meaning of civil war …every time he asking about civil war
Why do both of them talking at the same time. Its hard to listen
Another question: How many lies you said to the people to come to power during your over 40 yrs of so-called political career. Liars are always get stuck when they face the truth
Who will come to get interviewed by this mad man who doesnt allow the guest to talk..he can question and answer himself..no wonder this poor journalist got fired from msnbc😂😂😂
Im not a RW fan, but why are Mehdi et all bombarding  just this person with all these questions?
My humble request. Can jazeera interview former president Mahinda Rajapaksa?  It's really fantastic debate. Congrats Mr Mahdhi
It's quite disappointing to see how Ranil Wickremesinghe avoids giving direct answers to the journalist's questions in this interview. Instead of addressing the issues head-on, he seems to dodge and deflect, sidestepping accountability. As citizens, we expect transparency and honesty from our leaders, especially when addressing critical matters. It’s important for all leaders to engage openly and take responsibility to build trust with the public. Until the day comes when justice is served and wrongdoing is duly punished, we will continue to wait and watch.
Terrorist sympathisers, is this an interview or a interrogation. Let the man answer questions
This healed me. No journalist in main stream to question like this here in sri lanka. Thank u for revealing truth side of this fu.... thief murderer..
I'm 12 minutes in and this guy can't answer a simple question. His constant rambling is annoying. Good grief...
This is the first time i seen a fantastic interview done buy a great journalist no srilankan journalist will have the back bone ask these questions thank you Mr journalist.
Well, no politicianin SL to face bravly this type of face to face inteview. Whether he gabe correct answer to the question, Ranil was vigilant to give answers keeping the country possition and his dignity. Being veteran politicians he did it well. Well done
Why did he even went there? 😂
I don't know if the people there know about the LTTE terrorists using suicide bombers to kill Sinhalese people en masse. I think all the people there are supporters of the LTTE terrorists. They have a huge grudge against the Sinhalese people. Do they know or not that 72% of Sri Lanka is made up of Sinhalese people?
Hey Hasan/ Al Jazeera ,could you please confirm how long this interview lasted? Mr. Wickramasinghe mentioned in the media that it was a 2-hour program but was only aired for 48 minutes. Please confirm this.
Please question the Rajapaksa thieves one by one.
Some of these questions should go to Mahinda and co. Mehdi Hasan, why don't you invite MR / GR and co and do this interview? Get the same audience and get the same panelists and try it out. Can you? I bet you CANNOT!
You guys interviewed the correct person and you guys just asked the questions that were going on in many Srilankan's head.
Why are you only talking about the victims of North and East? How about the victims of the other part of the country? Do you think those people who were killed from the other part of the country are useless? Justice is justice whether they are from North or South.
when was the last time islamic sympathizers Mehdi and his puppet masters Qatar invite any third world muslim country's leader and questioned like this ?
I am really thanks for your asking questions about previous year's happened in Sri Lanka.
The fact that I don't understand about Mehdi Hasan is that why is he not letting RW finish his answers. This is not how you question. RW is ready to give his answers but this journalist is not letting him to do. First learn the basics and then come to the show. This is not how you treat a famous figure.
Ask your presenter to let the guest to speak
Mir. Rani was not fece to question , he is hiding his feces.  These are all questions you have to ask for Rajapaksh family.  They did all   the problems in my country , and Runil just helped.  Please bring Rajapaksh family.
It's not a fair interview. It's not seems to be an interview but interrogation.
Could u give timestamps just want to see whether he justifies the genocide against the tamils
Mehdi Hasan asks questions but when the answer doesn't align with his viewpoint he gets argumentative and then jumps to another accusation. As per Hassan, Sri Lanka has no right no defend it's Parliament nor democracy, the president is responsible for prosecuting and convicting other Politicians. None of them lived through this time, have no understating of what a precarious situation we were in, how precarious the situation in the Parliament was, have no clue about what they are talking about, but without having a discussion  they are questioning and arguing with just reading the some interesting headlines. This was not an interview nor a discussion but desperate attempt to get viewers by laying all the wrongs of every other leader on the first person he gets into an interview with.
Thanks for questioning like this
Invite the past presidents one by one n question them their history's n their responses.
Why you upload the edited video .. Maybe a court order push you to drop the original video it will be just like Kamala Harris unedited CBS video
For the first time criminals like him are really facing questions for the genocide they committed and the money they stole.
Good Valuable questions step by step  about human right violation  & without preventing these crimes 😢😢😢😢
What a stupid way to answer questions.
This is not full discussion
Let him answer the question otherwise what is the point of bringing him to the meeting.
How you get such people on your platform at the first place! I really wonder is it money or some kind of bond... Taking the least accountable people and holding them accountable!  Wow...And Mehdi Hasan is so dauntless... I would really like an episode on how AlJazeera manages such impossible interviews
MH asked critical questions that needed to be asked putting RW in the spot. All of this went down the drain with MH not allowing RW to speak at all. The question was longer than the time MH gave RW to respond.  MH displayed speaking not too different from how some MPs used to cause chaos in Parliament.  This ought to have been done with more patience and civility, for maximum impact.
Why they haven’t invited Sinhala people to make it fair.
asking for a friend  . Is this channel supporting LTTE ?
Where did I come from and how am I stuck? My throat is getting dry. I will never come to this political side again. Just leave me alone, God 😭😭
I believe that the person asking the questions should show patience while waiting for answers from the interviewer. It seems that the interview could be more effective if the person asking the questions was more considerate.
You call this is journalism? He can question the Gulf  states..he’ll never ..other powerful nations politicians 😂😂😂 you guys having ajenda surrounded by former LTTE supporters 😂😂😂even he talk about what’s happening Nabor countries..
Does good journalism mean asking questions and interrupting the speaker when he is explaining? How ridiculous is that? It's clearly very poor journalism. It's good to satisfy certain groups of people who like to hear what they want but not the truth.
Good job done by a Al jazeera.❤❤❤ Tks Aljazeera. Questioning the trueth.
Interview Anura Kumara and ask about the JVP terrorism next time and how they blocked the country from being developed for the last 76 years or so.
Why you did not ask these questions from Rajapaksha's family last 10 years...  Your question very sensible and smart.
Finally someone asked those questions from a politician directly without hesitation. But I think there is some kinda misunderstanding about the war they are like defending LTTE
@ Mr. Nirj Deva i wonder  how much did he pay u to cover his *s  like this omg
I admit that Mr. Ranil & Rajapakse’s behaviors towards common people was not good. I don’t like those regimes. But, a very few nations were there to help us during the war period. I ask one question. Why now?  We don’t need international investigation for such crimes that happened. A new government should execute an internal investigation with an acceptable transparency.
Invite Trump and ask him about the US funding Israel to kill women and children in Palestine.
Al Jazeera, why didn't you upload the full interview? The original interview was nearly two hours long, while this was only 50 minutes. Is that because the former Sri Lankan president blasted your Mehdi Raza Hasan? Please upload the FULL INTERVIEW!
Like police inquiry.
How about the stilankan catholic Church taking the ltte flag to pope frances and getting it blessed? What do u think of that? We all know about u all. Wickremesinghe is now a spent force for tge west now. That's the only difference 😂
Respect asking questions like this
Hey Meddhi, Why don't you have the common courtesy of letting the man answer the question that you asked. I have seen your style before . It may work with some politicians but not with this guy. Let the man answer without trying to be a pop star or should I say 3rd grade clown!😂
Can you please invite Gota or Basil to this next time?
Ridiculous questions all biased and completely without basis or facts to substantiate them. Who gives the authority for these questions to be asked as though they are all true??
This journalist's tactic is giving a questions without letting the person to answer. Then when the guys starts to answer at some point this guy again interrupts. That's journalism. JD Vance was right about this person. An Oxford degree cant offer someone some brain matter and quality. Letting someone to talk is courtesy. He didn't have that. If this is called journalism Al jazeera is in a serious trouble. Anyway Al Jazeera never was a prominent media.
I don't wanna defend Ranil, but this line of questioning is so biased. Even the criminal should be allowed to defend him/her self.
Amazing questioning my son, none of Sri Lankan journalists has the courage to question this corrupt politician, a narcissistic psychopath
Can you make an interview with Daisy Achi?
Justice for civil war victims! Why is it always the people in the North in Sri Lanka who are regarded as war victims? People in the South lost lives due to suicide bombers, and they deserve justice, too.
Do any of you remember Callum Macrae?
In sri lanka he used to tell a joke and go away from the questions😮‍💨
If you questioned someone, let them finised his argument, but these Journalist do not want to answer, just he need to accusation, These kind of interview not appreciatable.
Who does appoint AG of Sri Lanka?
The way he answer the questions it's funny I can read Mr been comedy movie 😂😂😂what kind of attitude he is showed in the stage 😂😂😂
this was not an interview, it was an interrogation!
Those asking if journalists in Sri Lanka question politicians like this. Did you guys grow up in Sri Lanka in the 80s, 90s and 2000s? Do you remember how journalists, even the common people for that matter were taken out for speaking the truth or confronting politicians or confronting the narrative the politicians were trying  to paint? Do you remember white vans? I can still viscerally feel the unsafety of growing up in Sri Lanka.
Journalist must have modesty but this one havent little bit of it. He was trying to get the answer which he want. But really is different . Thank you mr RW for safe the name and independence of the Sri Lanka . Al Jazera, please train your journalist with modest and basics of journalism .
Has the author ever tried to research the innocent others who lost lives at the hand of terrorists over 26 years.
Aggressive questioning , is not in  decent way ,  So Mr ranil responses correctly.
Is this funded my diaspora??
O Worried about the victims, but what have they done to the victims? The other thing is that all these things happen only for money
You have to have balls of steel to face Mehdi questions.
It is a pleasure that for the first time an international media outlet has questioned an accountable individual as the voice of justice for the Tamil people.
If d persons dont know english well what will happen
Pains me to watch this! Honestly! Finally he was asked real questions. And from the answers finally the world sees who he is.
This is how exactly the SL government people answer questions from public, so careless and a stupid joke at the end. This should be changed!
How a such Butcher become such clam?
If Anura Kumara there instead of RW this kind of thing never happens. because Anura can't understand or speak English so there should be translator in between Mehedi and Anura .Anura speak in Sinhala and Translator convert to English and when Mehedi asked a question translator convert in to Sinhala 🤣🤣
Why the lady have questions written, can see already she is on preparation of condom the country of srilanka
Is this a comedy show ?
Plz come and teach the way of questioning and the style of handling such personnel for SL journalist ❤️ Respect Al jazeera
MrM,you asked the question &the answer &used the so called interview for your agenda we all wanted to here W answers.not yours  you should stick to lecture's
All the Sinhala Buddhists who come here and claim to be healed, How many of you actually carry the guilt of Tamil Genocide? Or are you just here to watch your ex-president get roasted and eat popcorn?
More times was allocated for questioning and but not for answering questions. Allegations were made without any evidence by journalists. Unfair questions without providing time to explain. No tolerance and respect given to respected president. No manners or discipline displayed by journalists
As a journalist, you should be asking questions, yes, but also give the individual your questioning their time to answer your questions to the best of their knowledge instead of being childish by talking over him and cutting him off mid sentence and should maintain your composer by keeping professionalism and not be easy on the temper
Thanks a lot asking like good question. Ranil wickramasinghe met a real journalist 😍
After asking questions not giving time to reply & interrupting the reply is the most rude & ugly thing to do in any news channels.
Direct questions with proper evidence. Lucky to see journalist like you and I'd like to thank you for Sri Lanka❤️🙏
What he does is if any question has a direct impact on him turn it into a joke otherwise you can see the Lion If you want a real grill bring any of the Rajapaksha s , but make sure get them wear a diaper first.
Great and Realist Questions and Typical SL Politicians’ Answers
No one questioned before like the way this journalist did.. Even not Lanka Journalists💥
Ranil Rajapaksha, The way he answering the questions like a joker  🤡
Former president Ranil should be bought in front of court questions like this, they always play game with Sri Lankan media as most media obey this politicians.kind request if this can translate the conversation or subtitle in local languages will a great work.
A real predicament for Ranil... Yes this is the kind of questioning that should be used when corrupt politicians are interviewed...
Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? 😝😝😝😝 RW and his political future (if he had at least a slim chance) it was f….ek on international media.
This is the line of questioning we need in srilanka! 🇱🇰  Hats off to Al-Jazeera! 🫡
Ask how many useless committees he  appointed and wasetered the country's money
Wow next time ask why he has English name as well during British era in SL..? Time to time many people use in western world use that names for benefit 😘
Why did you change the DP referring to war crimes?
Ranil : U gonna do what abt it ?  😂😂 ( sri lankan politics = joke ) its a fkin game
Some journalist in sri lanka like interview with ranil wickramasinghe and  questions as you.But he not face that.  You are the man hasan . Respect you 👏  You were questions are the  thousand of sri lankans questions  well known about ranil wickramasinghe.
That guy Nirj Deva was asking questions until the break and somehow became supportive to the former president!
Why our comment are you deleting?
Mr Ranil (Batalantha) escaping from the question 😂
Stupid journalist and a stupid question.  We are Sri Lankans. 🇱🇰 Come and experience who we are, what we can do here and what we do here in this blessed Island Nation
Mr Hazan do you can ask questions from Former USA President like this 🤣
Hats off to the journalis. He got the real journalism unlike some of biased SriLankan journalists who will never ask such questions from Ranil.
Did anyone question other countries like this? Why Sri Lanka.
Iam sri lankan.. and iam enjoying how mahidi asking these question and enjoying how struggle he answer to it
This is so satisfying to watch!🔥 superb questioning mehdi and thank you al jazeera. I just wish you could interview Rajapakshas too.
what about the killings over 30 years, even if you can justify the cause they were fighting for? This type of solutions are generations old.
How gave him a job in al jaseera asking foolish questions without proof no background working just asking like some uneducated opposition and not even listening to the answer
If there was a legal election and had a majority, is it a crime in Sri Lanka? when it is the accepted democratic process for the whole world.
I was thinking like.. he was ambushed by these questions, not like the ones he was told that he would get, but instead he got the real ones which he didnt prepared.. anyway super comedy..
11:25 funny What's wrong 🥲
Ranil’s like where’s Chamuditha 😂
At least Mr.Ranil couldn't understand the question and give an answer.great questioning!🙌
This proves Chamuditha is better.. asks a question and he answers him self and not letting him to answer.. what is expected from this interview is a questions.
Not the best interview I've seen.. yes medhi asked good questions but never allowed to answer and vica versa ranil was being a joke by acting like a child.. the issue is he was asked loaded questions that cannot be answered simply..
How come you guys not talking about what Tamil tigers did to our country?  LTTE did the War crimes not our sri lankan army.  You guys are famous for hiding the truth. Talk with people who care about sri lanka not from the people who destroyed the country.
A long awaited interview (with the excellent questions) for Sri Lankan. Well done Mr. Mehdhi Hassan. Hats off!
It's indeed puzzling why Mr. Wickramasinghe didn't bring up the civilian casualties caused by the LTTE. The Sri Lankan Civil War was a tragic conflict that resulted in loss of life on both sides. It's essential to acknowledge the suffering of all Sri Lankans, regardless of their affiliations.
Make inquiry and question, interview Palestine Israel war, Russian Ukraine war
We have not found a journalist in Sri Lanka who has the knowledge and ability to question politicians who evade issues like Ranil. Our thanks to this excellent journalist.
Is everything a game to you ???  Yes he was a gamer and he played with sri lanka .. rw mf
Finally a journalist who asked all the right questions from a corrupt srilankan politician
When you ask about war crime they have no guts to face the question in front of the world, shame on them..
Can you interview putin and zelensky regarding Ukraine war?
Really appreciate as a Sri Lankan. In Sri Lanka these corrupted politicians are not get questioned like this.
yoo what happened to grandpa's Ferrari license😭
That journalist only just throw the question and not giving a chance to explain, maybe he already cornered
interviewing by not allocating time to answer is journalism?  This is totally the vision of the journalist . He tries to prove his aspects. At least they must telecast/ upload the unedited version of the discussion . This is partial to killers who killed thousands of sri lankans  by Tamil tigers.
Mr bean - Where is the report ??😂😂
Kudos to the interviewer for asking sharp and insightful questions 🎤🔥
This man was the prime minister and governed the country for 6 times. If he is a good leader, how come SL face this crisis after 6 episodes of his governance? 😂 He was the part of the problem.... The current government is far better than each and every government in the past.
Hats of off to AlJazeera, all the questions are covered nicely, very good job Mahdi Hassan - from Sri Lanka
Where is the report where is the report where is the report?
Great questions from Al Jazeera.  Asking favourable questions and praising is what most politicians used to.. especially in Srilanka
Where is the evidence  There is no report  I deny the allegations  Sri Lankan politicians are above the law  Justice will be served to the poor with interest some times  With the new government hoping things might change a little bit  But doubt the big fishes will ever be caught, like this joker
Why are you interrupting
It just 49.27mnts? Where is the un-edited full program? This is going to another direction,as a Sri Lankan, We can understand what is going here..
If you ask quesrions like this is Sri Lanka, Sudu Van Thamai
What was your reaction?
Why is the interviewer interrupting him
Great stuff AJ! Would love to see how you’d do the same with Obama, Bush and/or Blair  in that seat, being questioned in the same manner!
What is this reporter doing here? What is his role in this meeting? His part is unclear.🤔
Who's next ?
Thank you for questioning him like this Mehdi ❤ Much respect to you 👏
This is a cheap journlism. This is not an interview, it was interrogation,. This al jazeera sucks LTTE hooligans, that is the reason they are feeded by israel in daily basis. If a responsible media, teach ur low paid workers some discpline. This is like screaming and shouting at sunday market  disgusting
"Was the journalist who questioned Ranil Wickremesinghe on Al Jazeera a terrorist or an extremist?"
Huge salute to the real reporter on behalf of millions of people! They always controlled the media for decades and decades. This is a real solid questions 😊😊 Thank you ❤
These should ask from current government before they leave. After leave no accountable. Mr Wickramasigne we must praise at least he bought country back.
Ask him Why he spent millions of public money on his Presidential Election.😢😢😢😢
Wondering why single Sri Lankan journalists unable to had an interview like this ….🤔  Respect Mehdi
No one questions politicians like this in Sri Lanka. Respect
No Srilankan journalist has the courage to ask questions like this. This is true professional journalism.
Without back bone sri lankan reporters never questioning such a way. Thanks very much Al jazeera for questioning such a merderer.
I believe he never faced a real journalist 😂.  Excellent questions.
😢too painful to watch. What was RW trying to achieve?
Necessary questions were asked. But the journalist should also have the patience and maintain a mature behaviour to let the other person to talk whether he likes the answer or not.
Thank you very much Al-Jazeera.   Sri Lankan media is not able to ask this question.   He is a fox, Srilankan media cannot catch this fox.
Think....its another USAID funded... Journalism and a journalist....question a person who opposed the well established regime change ...the only person who reversed the well oiled regime changing juggernaut. Salute you Ranil... Citizen of Sri Lanka...
I thought Ranil would just collapse right there at the pace of questions thrown at him by Mehdi
Really good questions Mehdi. Ranil Wikramasinghe tried to be cocky like he does every time when someone asked him a challenging question.  Thank you for exposing him and his moral corruption more than anything ❤
Grandpa looks very uncomfortable, the questions are too real for him.
Why can’t the Tamils just move to India , find issues there and leave Sri Lanka to the Sinhalese?
No one in Sri Lanka questioned like this before because he did not attend to any real live programs....
Al Jalzeera questioning about human rights abuse is really so touching. Please do the next interview with Qatari Royal families with the same resolve.
I wonder how these politicians can sleep peacefully after doing all these atrocities and killings to their own country.
Why is there no Sinhalese representation on the board? They have a story too. I think more than 100 million Tamils live in India and around the globe. If they really want a territory, they can establish it in Tamil Nadu.
This is gold Al Jazeera. I wanted to see him  question like this for years.
Dear Hiru and Derana Tv, (srilankan unuseful medias)  learn from aljazeera, how to take interviews from corrupt politicians?  Respect Mehdi🫡 and Aljazeera🤝
This shows how immature  Ranil is. He cannot answer a simple question and take no responsibility. Shame on you Ranil. You no longer represents any value of  Sri Lankan people. Ranil is an arrogant  politician who lead Sri Lanka to 30 year civil war.
Can you please post the entire interview without cutting and editing ?
why is there a LTTE panel? they are biased
Question is in the Title  & the Answer is on the Thumbnail 😒
Asking the Fox about who ate the Hens
When Sri Lankan are doing well now, why these aliens want to talk about this poor country when the countries they live in do more atrocities world wide behind closed doors
why  dont you question Keir Starmer like this?
The journalist must allow the president to answer the question, instead of interrupting.
Does anyone know the root cause of this conflict?
The way he is answering the question quite funny … you you you 😂😂😂
What a despicable man is this? He is asking where is the report. The report clearly stated that Ranil Wickramasinghe must be PROSECUTED.
Isn't this a Hamas channel  ?
What was your motive in this exercise? If you want your audience to get the other person's response better, give him time and space rather than being arrogant. Your motive of making the other uncomfortable and uneasy was well observed.
The question is correct, but let him talk before you answer; you're interrupting.
Our hard earned money deposited with the Banks for getting interest for our survival was taxed. Why?
You should at least let him answer the question. Always talking over and moving on to the next question. What's the point of interviewing then?
The Criminal Rajapakse should be questioned like this and brought to justice
How about the corruption during his rule
It's a mystery as to why RWS is visiting the Indian pm so oftentimes when he is not even member of parliament.
Only you had the nerve to ask that question, and as Sri Lankans, we bow our heads in gratitude to Al Jazeera.❤
He is asking too many questions at once, leaving him no chance to explain. Let him explain, please.
In Sri Lanka, all questions are pre prepared by the interviewee .
Can you guys keep him? Please don't let him get back on the return plane
Beautiful, great questions and interview with evil citizen of Sri lankan
This look likes a comedy episode rather than a questionnaire 😂
Is Ranil crying 😂😂😂😂???  Well done reporter . Respect you.
Great questioning 👋👋👋 good al jazeera
If you have guts ask questions from trump in this way. on that day,  You will learn a lesson
why intrviewer not giving time to answer him..
No contest, what does it mean
Hats off to this brave journalist for questioning Ranil like this, being Sri Lankans we appreciate your effort
CIvil War??  it's Separatist war between a terrorist ethnic group and Army.!
Can you please interrogate the somali president this would interesting
Respect to this real journalist who has a backbone to question the corrupt 🤜🏼
He has no answer for your questions  Good job sir ❤
He is wandering around unable to answer.
Separatist group? You mean the terrorists.
Calmer questioning would have resulted in complete answers
Is this a comedy show😂😂😂😂entha moana Ranil center fresh sapadanga😂😂😂😂
At the beginning he is the fighter. After couple of questions, he is the flighter.
If you ask a question and don’t give him a chance to answer thinking you’re far ahead of him it shows your indecency as a reporter
Instead of firing questions like this why don't you go and interview the Israeli prime minister on the war crimes millions of people who have lost their lives ..homes...children who have been maimed...lost their child hood...the orphans...those who are starving because of the wars and everyone thinks they are justified....!
Excellent interrogation by a real journalist.
Why no answer the question raised regarding why LTTE didn't agree for the peace when RW invited them to come for the peace agreement when he was the PM in 2002 to 2004?
It is now quite apparent that international politics and media are pushing for another war in Sri Lanka. If their intentions were honest, why was the interview so polarized towards one extreme? Why wasn't a balanced view presented to the viewers? Isn't that part of the problem? You expect justice when your interview itself sets an bad example of not serving justice to a balanced view.
What a childish way to act upon the civil war question!!
Which type of foolish questions ?
The ideal set of questions to invent old-new problems and distort any reconciliation 🙂
Response is more like childish as mentioned by Mehdi.   But the information that has been questioned by Mehdi to Ranil sounds horrific and monstrous.   How can one deny when evidence is thrown at tour face and still you cant accept it. The body language tells it out.
Wonder what they told him the interview was going to be about..
Nothing could be more straightforward and BLUNT in the questions asked by Mehdi. I mean straight answers couldn't be given it was more like dodging the questions. This is more like an embarrassment.
What happened to this journalist ?
This old man is at the wrong platform 😂😂😂 you cannot get rid of mehdi with his questions ...
Just wanted to know has mehdi hassan only seeing Ranil at rajapaksa birthday party singing, not the time ranil lost to rajapaksa ? But Ranil could have been sarcastic instead of getting angry
Bugger’s just dodging every question with straight up nonsense instead of answering. You can tell he’s stressed😂🔥
Is this LTTE propaganda being used against Ranil Wickremesinghe? The majority of the questions are not even related to him, as he has always been with the minority UNP. This was part of the U.S. liberal political agenda against Rajapaksa and Shavendra, but now things will change with conservatives in power for Rajapaksa.
Has anyone lost a grandfather? 🤔🤔🤔 He's here. Please go and take care of him.🙏🙏🙏
Someone could give him a glass of water 😀😀 I guess his throat was dried by the questions
The questions are supposed to be directed at Rajapaksa, but this fellow is asking them to Ranil Wickremesinghe, quoting that he attended Rajapaksa's birthday party and sang a song. What a joke!
Who is to blame for Sri Lanka’s crises? One is Infront of you
why dont you publish the full recording which held for two hours?
i think the host coming from a fish market.. who is appointed him as a journalist in al jazeera??
What is this interview against Rajapaksha family?
Hasitha Wijewardena please learn from this journalist how to ask the valuable questions not like a Netflix & Nonses
Seeyata redhi ille! He may utter all kinds of lies but his squirming & closed up body language that get worse with each questions shows what the reality is.
Very good  question
Giving a mike to dumb media Person is like giving a gun to a monkey..!! so stupid and dumb..Through out the time he was asking questions not letting answers to raise…
Why is there are some cut scenes
How many people were killed in Palestine and Ukraine...
It is pure comedy gold – a masterclass in dodging every question with his signature ‘no contest’ routine! If only his policies were as evasive as his answers…
would like to know the view of this Madura Rasaratnam  of suicidebombing of LTTE and killing innocent people , where is the justice ???
This man is don’t know how to interview ,He did not give the time to answer the question .
You ask part of the problem ,about the problem 😅
Insted of Answering the Q? He just try to bring Religion and cover. All fals answer
This man is very stupid. He did not give the time to answer the question .
Useless stupid typical questions.  Arabic version of Suranga / Camuditha. As the world knows, Al Jazeera is always one-sided. However, people who sold the war and settled in the western countries enjoy this type of drama. As a Sri Lankan, I am with Mr. Wickramasinghe to defend the country.
Why no one asked about new born babies killed by LTTE? Why no one asked about bomb blats did by LTTE targeting civilians in south? Why no one asked about killing Kadirgamar former minister foreign affairs ( who was Tamil)?
How can gotabaya be arrested without a single charge ? Moron
Ask the Indians what they did too
Praise for Mehdi Hasan and Al Jazeera for firm questioning him.
Do you think this guy was a president? None of the issues fell under his responsibility.
Thanks Al Jazeera for asking the real questions
and just like that al jazeera became BBC 😂 time to unsubscribe... worst interviewer ever... ask a question, interrupt midway and proceed to lecture with a dash of virtue signalling reminds me of sunday school Medhi maybe you should find a new job you'd be a really good sunday school teacher .... just an idea
This journalist is a real jerk.He is not having a discipline at least to give a fair time to give an answer to the question he asked. If the current SL president  is in this seat , (who is the hero of the most of the people who commented in this video) can't imagine what will happen to him.
Can u please do investigation about what JVP party did things in 88 to 89
If someone asks modi like this, he would be missing the next day.
Asks from the culprit 😂😂
Ranil is a joker. whenever he get's a difficult question he jokes out of it. For the first time he met a real journalist
A truly strong interview would balance tough questioning with deep analysis, allowing viewers to gain a clearer picture of both past failures and future possibilities. Some interviews focus on assigning blame rather than deeply analyzing the root causes of Sri Lanka's crises A good journalist should allow to answer the question without interrupting. Many Head to Head interviews rely on aggressive questioning. While this can be effective, excessive interruptions or confrontational tones might not allow the guest to fully explain their stance.
It seems all these questions are taken from a dumb Sri lankan
This?  F****** man is a bank robbery, man.
What about all the Sinhalese were killed including women and children???
For the last 70 years the politicians has been avoiding questions the way Ranil did today. Sri Lankan Press was always protecting the politicians. Good questioning, thank you.
Thank you Al-Jazeera. This is the first time he's been questioned like this; something he likely never expected.
Medhi is annoying we have a similar journalist personality in sri lanka asking questions not allowing a response 😅
Why the interviewer not giving enough time for guest to answer?
The interviewer has a set plan question but RW faces perfectly.
You would have asked about batalandha 😀😀😀
Can you add sinhala subtitles
What about the thousands of Sinhalese people that were killed by the LTTE during the war? It was mass murder. Why doesn’t Tamil Diaspora talk about it?
This interview is very funny. The presenter not giving time to answer the questions he raised. He will be the best comedian presenter in the world.😂😂😂😂
This former Fake President couldn't answer any question by  journalist as shameless to Sri Lankan history and blady brutel Batalanda hechman!
He is trying to glide from the questions by making funny stories. 😂 definitely he thought this also like talk with chamuditha 😂😂😂😂😂
Thanks to Aljazeera ❤ good questions😂
Here the journalist asked  what you are watching on Netflix. Thanks for questioning
😂😂 funny journalist .. he asking question and answering .😂😂😂.
Mehdi is interrupting with questions before RANIL completes his answers. Mehdi is level headed and spoiling the flow of the interview. He must let invitees answer questions instead.
super hosting this is how sri lanka journalist should ask questions.
Hats off to Al Jazeera and Mehdi for holding this culprit accountable and asking the real questions. He probably came to the interview thinking it'll be the same as Sri Lankan media 😅
This is the first time I've  seen him mess up like this. Excellent questioning by the journalist.
Who is to blame for Sri Lanka’s crises? COVID, JVP, LTTE
He did NOT answer a single question he was asked and that's RanilRajapaksa for you! What a Liar   Liar...
For the sake of my knowledge i would like to know this head to head with talk with former president Of srilanka mr ranil wickramasinghe where took place means (which country)?
Thank you for asking questions like that we Sri Lankans are very happy about it
Why roasting one person ? Now all lives peacefully as one nation .one country ❤️   Any hidden intentions ! Just curious.
If these questions were asked inside Sri Lanka then this journalist will be a dead man walking.
Unliked this video because asked questions from bank robber
What is the purpose of interview with this guy?
He did not have no money to only to hold election  But he has money for all other unnecessary events ?
All individuals posing questions are affiliated with the LTTE diaspora, and their inquiries appear meticulously planned.
We do not accept war and what happened in the past. I know it is painful to lose loved ones. However, these kind of arguments tend to ask this question. Why no one is bothered about the civilians who were killed by the LTTE for decades? Specially sinhalese?
Really Bad journalism by Al Jazeera, When do you guys going to release another half of the interview?
Regarding Batalanda,  Ranil: Where is the report?👀 Reporter: Here it is! 😏 Ranil: Where?🥲😭
His main trump card is to threaten to leave when a difficult question comes up. The next trump card is to make a joke and run away from the issue. Sri Lankans will never be stupid enough to elect someone like Ranil.
This Interviewer is so unprofessional he is making a lot of effort to ask questions but no single patience to hear  the answers looking like dog is barking at selected anty ethnic group according to their script.
Leader and politician who to answer the question?
Where's ur ferari license ??
Those who prevented Ranil from winning the 2005 presidential election and brought Mahinda Rajapaksa to power are now questioning Ranil about Mahinda Rajapaksa. Have mercy on them
How could he have gone for a system change by not putting the show back of the road and prosecute the criminals when he himself is criminal
2/3 of the panel = NGOs ✅ Constant jump cuts ✅ Crowd filled LTTE diaspora ✅ Ask question then cut off ✅  This is disgusting gotcha gutter journalism 101.
Glad to see a courageous journalist questioning him He couldn't play his usual arguments with Mehdi
What is with the constant jumpcuts when the ex SL president was speaking?
Reporters must ask the the question cleaely and give the time to answer ... why the reporter is jumping like  frog or a dog and disturbing without complete his answer ??
This is brutal to watch, seriously. Anyway, I love how Mehdi Hasan breaks down Ranil from top to bottom with just very simple questions.
No one questions politicians like this in Sri Lanka. Respect
Did anyone talk about how LTTE did war crimes on those days ? How 6 hunderd police officer were killed
Ranil flew all the way to the UK to get cooked? 😂
So if your telling rw protected rajapaksha's Who's protecting them now? Rw❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
First time seeing  the anchor who knows for asking stupid quesion got roasted by Mr. Bean of Srilanka
Jeez.... how can he avoid the main question about not bringing Rajapakshas for what they had done?????
Did the president violate the Constitution? No.
You should bring PRESIDENT AKD and ask about rajapaksha's Because they are the ones who supported him in the firstly NOT A LEADER WHO DID A GREAT JOB AS THE PRESIDENT FROM 2022-2024 WITH NOTHING RW❤❤❤❤❤
What cunning joker this Ranil Wickramasingha?
This Muslim Brotherhood Kawarij isn't letting him talk.
