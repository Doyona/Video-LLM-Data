Where is the season 5 trailer?
SEASON 5 TRAILER?????
Ok where’s the season 5 trailer?
Noob question what are the spirit abimal things they are channeling?
Whose here after Necros?
Can we get 4 player team up back in comp platinum and higher?
Did anyone notice the mark on angelas head at 1:17? That might be part of dare devils base kit.
cross progression when? i just wanted my battle pass skins from s0-s3 on my console to my pc
Idk what tf you guys have done for optimization on ps5 but it feels worse and the is FPS drops and screen jittering
Is it coming out on Xbox?
May I ask if it will be available on consoles? And if yes on wich ones?
is anyone missing their season 3 and 3.5 ranked rewards? I didn't get mine and one of my friends in GM didn't either. wonder if its a bug 🤔
What Are They even fighting for 😭🙏🙏
So looks like one of Daredevil’s abilities is to blind opponents?
I'm not familiar with Angela, could someone explain why she only has one wing?
Vro when was lawyers able to do ts???😭
Anyone else get Asura's Wrath vibes from DD's animations?
New status effect?? 1:16  there is a hand eye logo above her head and she was blind
Is Daredevil the bad guy in this? Angela in the comics is arguably an anti-hero, but in Rivals she is defending K'un-Lun to protect her infant sister. Why is Daredevil attacking the city?
Anyone else notice the little Red hand appear above Angelo after he finished screaming LDO? I wonder how that plays into the game
Was that Alex Le again!?!?
Wtf why they are keep making battle scenes instead of an actual new season trailer
Marvel is very much capable of this level of animation for a show but choose  not to why????
Umm since when is Dardevil magic? 😂 Whatever this is awesome!
Isn’t the devil a false angel tho?
What was the mark above Angela’s head
hows the gameplay? is my screen just gonna be black coz hes blind
Do i have to fight Gna again?
What is this version of daredevil?? And will we be getting him in the game? I would love to play me some daredevil
0:08 Zane’s bird playable in marvel rivals now?
0:33 is that my goat Aleks Lee?
Was that hela's bird?
Who’s playing daredevil because he sounds a lot like Asura from Asura’s Wrath
Blind Lawyer vs Goddess?   The rivalries are marvellous.
I’m confused… thought dare devil was just another name for stunt devil. Aka scared of nothing. Not a literal devil
ALEKS LE????
is the "let the devil out" a reference to the netflix show or was that a common line in the comics?
when Captain Marvel?
Never played. Probably won’t be playing.  But how do you top this animation…
So am I the only one who noticed the PS4 logo?
1:14 Did he just inflict a debuff on her in the trailer? She's got a hand symbol on her head.
1:15 Is that the "Curse of the Hand" above her head?
Dragon??? Wheres Shang-chi at?
what is this dragon ball ahhhh fight, DID DAREDEVIL JUST GO SUPER SAIYAN 😭
So am I the only one who gonna be Lording DD on day 1 ? Because I’m beyond ecstatic that my guy DD is on the game
Where xbox one?
Wheres deadpool?
So why haven't your animators been hired to make a series yet?
Is Murdock the villian of S4 with “The Beast” possessing him?
I really liked the animation and the characters chosen but Why on ps4 Now ? It's just a question
Who tf is that, that aint daredevil from hells kitchen bro wth
Can we bring back 6 and 4 stacks for competitive matchmaking? So many people are leaving because they can’t play with their friends and it’s a team oriented multiplayer hero shooter. Makes no sense to only have duo queue in upper ranks, also the comm bans are insane. You can’t use any curse words at all, season 0 and 1 were so good but now the games got 90% less players, clearly the changes aren’t all good
Finally, a TANK! And another....duelist...Seriously?
How is no one talking about the crazy animation?
Pleas tell me it comes for XBOX ONE too!
Anyone else notice the hand symbol above Angela’s head at 1:14? Think that happen when marked by daredevils ult?
Let's see if other Marvel-Characters like Drax the Destroyer, Falcon, Shang-Chi, Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers), Ms. Marvel, Hercules, Tigra, The Frankenstein Monster, Mystique, Marrina Smallwood will Appear in Marvel Rivals! Because I'm excited about Daredevil and Angela in Marvel Rivals Season 4.
Question is Daredevil possessed because I noticed that he smiled? 1:07
Guys why did they add Diddy to marvel rivals cuz like hes like dd? yknow ? GE-
I wonder if the hand symbol above angela that apapeared after 1:14 is only after daredevil used his ult or is it because he can detect her like Punisher's passive ability.
Why did this animation make me wanna read all of DD's comics now dawg ? 😭💔🥀
which one is coming out first?
I don't know why everybody thinks DD is going to be a DPS 😂 That boy look bulky as hell and remember y'all got two duelist last season, only fair we get our vanguards on this one 🔥
Why is daredevil fighting an Asgardian with real power ? He’d get his ass whopper irl
What is this muscle woman?
Angela?...nah, that's rhea ripley in armor
So Daredevil is suddenly a demonic nine tail jinchuriki energy projecting superpowered individual? Devs are overreaching with these powersets, Daredevil is basically just a blind acrobat.
Is that black myth? 😂
Is Daredevil's VA the same as MKX Scorpion???
One question could do it so that Marvel rivals can be Played with low end Laptop because i own one low end laptop and i would Like to enjoy Marvel rivals on my low end Laptop it would be very helpful and i know that there are other players with low end laptop or pc who would Like to enjoy Marvel rivals so please i am on my Knees please let it playable on low end devices
Why is Angela buffer than standard she hulk?  She's the assassin of asgard, not the roid rager of asgard.
Who's daredevil voice actor? He sounds cool
Is that a comic daredevil? I ain’t remember him having powers like that?
When is cross progression being implemented?
Who hurt bro?
Is it just me or are the maps bleak and not like as cool as how the characters look
Who even is Angela? I have no idea but she looks cool & has 8-pack abs.
Is that Aleks Le?
how tf does dare devil have godly abilities isnt he just a blind batman like detective roaming around in nyc ?
Yooo why is daredevil so amped giving my boy God powers😂🔥
1mil views in less than a day, idk how can this old  game still popular
bro what the hell is this animation, looks fucking insane
Did we just get a flying tank and another dps?
Can we get a legendary magneto skin this season?
Is that a… is that a.. a yokai?
00:25 is CONAN THE BARBARIAN? SHAO-KAHN?
Uh, guys? Angela’s from Spawn.
Does anyone know what daredevil was saying when he screamed
What are they feeding the Lawyers in NYC? 🙏😭
I want to ask anyone, please tell me this valkyrie is a character of MARVEL and not a new creation of netease.
Why is Daredevil fighting a Spawn character 😂.
Is that a ps4 logo I see there? 💀💀💀
Hi, I have a question. I hope someone can answer. I arrived about a month ago in Season 3, and I'm reading that with the Deluxe Pass, I can unlock rewards from previous seasons. Is that true? Can I access Seasons 1 and 2 and unlock things even though I arrived in Season 3?
Question for the nerdier nerds then myself, is that one of Hela’s crows or something else. Genuinely curious….
Was that Angela from spawn ? Cause same weapon and look
WTF did I just watch? Daredevil is now a dragon?
who voices daredevil??
Wait so does he mark people cause I saw a hand on to of her head
Is... is Daredevil playing heel in this?!
Where are the supports?
1:14 Is that Daredevil's ultimate? Does he blind enemies? I can see some kind of 'hand mark' on Angela's face
Is this Daredevil even Matt Murdock or is it another Daredevil?
" _Dad, why was my sister named Rose?_ " " _Because your Mother loved roses Son._ " " _Thanks Dad._ " " _No problem _*_Season 4: The Heart of the Dragon Official Trailer | Clashes unfold Sept 12, 2025 | Marvel Rivals._* "
Are they really gonna add marvel rivals too the ps4?
is this daredevil possibly from psylockes universe bc he seems like he has powers and his design looks samurai-like
Why's everything in this game Asian themed.
my god, this animation is fantastic..... give us more!
Anyone else notice when Daredevil lets the Devil out. Angela has a hand with eye icon above her head! Does that mean Daredevil can track people with his ult? Or it's a passive?
Anyone catch that red hand over her head when he did that last move I bet that has something to do with his kit like he blinds everyone and can see the hands or something
Is that Aleks Le voicing Daredevil? It kinda sounds like him.
why does this game have to be sooooooo chinese???
Is Dare Devils VA also Sung Jin Woo?!
IS THAT VALKYRIE ?
Can't chinese companies stop with forced cultural thing on IP that has nothing to do with it ?
Is that Patrick Steitz voicing Daredevil?? Hard to tell but when Daredevil screams "OUT!", it sounds just like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat.
Are we sure he’s a street tier?
Um why is this so good? 😂😂😂
So who is the villain for this season
Can't they talk it over, like civilized folk?
who the hell is dIANG???
Where is DEADPOOL bro
Did foggy get life, red? - punisher
Can the game come to the Switch 2?
Since when can Daredevil summon a dragon?
Any spawn fans out there hyped for angela ??
WTH is that green thing
I wonder how Angela's interactions will be with her brothers Thor and Loki and her niece Hela
i wonder if they could get away with giving daredevil a kamen rider hibiki skin
is it me or daredevil looks like akira from devilman crybaby when he says let the devil out ?
Wasn't Angela a character owned by Image Comics and fought against Spawn???
Angela really from Spawn will Spawn be added in the future in the game as a guest character
Is Daredevil fighting Helya or Valkyria?
Please tell me Angela going to be Vanguard?
Okay so we've got Daredevil and... who's the other one?
Who is the one-winged angel?
What does a devil and an angel have to do with dragons? Nothing. Why do chinese companies work SO hard to insert Asian themes into their games every few months? Do American games force a cowboy theme several times a year? Do Nordic company games force Viking themes every few months? Just curious, do Chinese companies literally have a government mandate to do this? Because I see it in game after game whose over all theme has nothing really to do with chinese culture and feels in conflict with the world building in those games to the point of being immersion breaking.
Daredevil bro what's this costume😭 pls add classic skins, not as different colours.
Where’s quicksilver.
More of these animations please??
Why is Angela evil and attacking daredevil?
who's the woman?
Bro is that the GOAT Aleks Le voicing Daredevil????
Bros deal with mephisto or what? how he keep up with angela
Why daredevil sound like sun Jin woo
Oh shoot, Daredevil? First character to not be a part of that initial leak. Wonder if any plans had to be changed
Who is that woman?
Oh, a new season for Marvel Rivals, WAIT ITS COMING FOR PS4????
Why is Marvel rivals animation keep getting better and better🤯
What do you mean daredevil scrapping with god ??? 😂
Have yall considered making an anime?
Why are your teasers so F-ing Flashy?   It becomes uncomfortable to watch them. Also they look cheap and make you seem a bit "desperate for attention".
Lowkey is there any animated series with this good animation and artstyle 😅😅
On ps4 ???????????????   Thanks
will the screen be black when playing as daredevil?
I wonder will they add she-hulk or rogue someday?
So they're using a version of daredevil with like more powerful powers? I only know Netflix daredevil so it may be some comic version I'm unaware of.
I wanna know what was hela's crow doing 1:19
Excited but more DPS?!
Why add Angela when u could’ve added so many better characters, like apocalypse, doom, exodus, sentry, etc… also still no cross progression so what’s the point
I wonder if this Daredevil is under the influence of The Beast. I’d assumed this would be like the white suit Hand of God daredevil, given divine power, but the “let the devil out” when he activates his ult and darkness of his power up seem to imply it’s something malicious.
Why does daredevils voice sound like Alex Lee the voice of Jin woo from solo leveling
Who is the other person who isn’t daredevil?
Where is Polaris??? I see a trinket for her, but come on, lets get her in the game already!!
Will we be blind while playing dare devil???
When superman?
Is this Wanda in her dragon from at the end?
How are we going to play dare devil if he’s blind
wait, who's the other character? im not much of a comic book reader
Where Shang-Chi at?
Does anyone else notice the "PS4" logo at the end of the video?  Is that true?
what did they do to my daredevil
Are we sure that’s not just a new iron fist skin
I know DD.....who is she? 0_o
From the looks of it, this specific version of DD isn't Matt, maybe it's someone else wearing the Mantle of Daredevil, or maybe someone just possessed DD.
We getting Buff Mommy Flying Tank and Dragon Spirit Blind Lawyer, which do I get excited for? I cant pick!
Is daredevil voice actor same as Jiren from dragon ball ?
Is this the version of Daredevil that is possessed by the beast of the hand?
What in the marvel holy war is happening?!?!
Why are they not making a show with this animation
Surprised more people aren't mentioning this, but does this mean we're about to get a true flying tank? Wonder how that works if so
Anyone see the ps4 Playstation Logo or is just me? 😮
Nobody Lord with both yet? Casuals.
When's cross progression?
Can someone tell me the name of that angel girl??
Cross progression when?
is the angel lady Valkyrie or someone else?
Are they both tanks
Hmmm… I wonder what Angela’s lore in this is? since Hela already exists as Loki and Thor’s sister, you’d think they’d retcon Angela, but no, here she is in all of her ablicious glory.
WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING THESE ANIMATORS
Wait who is the bad guy this season?
When Cross Progressions?!
How is daredevil able to match blows with an angelic god?    he's a REALLY good lawyer
Is that Matt Murdock's Daredevil?
So who’s the bad guy? It’s looking like the devil
how we gonna play as a blind man 😂
Why does Angela have One Wing? Does she have a Sephiroth skin that we can purchase?
Where is my goat Deadpool
When is Ultron gonna get a new skin?
why tf does he have superpowers?
Since when did the mcu have hawkgirl?
WHAT FKIN ANIME AM I WATCHING????
Am I the only one who knows Angela is connected to Spawn?
Sooo can we get a support instead?
What do they feed the animators
another duelist? yay..........................
I wonder if Daredevil will actually play very different than his comic book versions with actual super power speed judging from this trailer. He is probably powered up by someone or something
I wonder if Matt ultimate ability would be like that cloak and dagger terror cape ability where the whole enemy team would get blinded for a certain time limit
Brooo what..?!!! 😮
They got Alex le?!
Is he dps???
IS THAT ALEKS LEE MY GOAT?? All im ever gunna hear playing daredevil is lighter
I need an explanation on why Daredevil is suddenly anime fast & super strong enough to fight Thor’s sister? Unless this is just a trailer presentation & nothing to do with the lord of the game.
Who are the actors who make the voices?
Damn what are they feeding this universe’s Daredevil that boy strong as hell 😭
Yo guys, i have decent aim in rivals but i am hard stuck plat. Any tips to rank up ?
What kinda super soldiers serum is Matt on to even be going toe to toe with a Demo Goddess. Trailers gas$$$$
Cross play?
Is that Aleks Le?
So I read the description and it seems this isn't Matt Murdock but someone called Dizang? Or am I wrong?
alright is it me, or is daredevil moving like that suspicious?? like ik he's acrobatic and shi, but to be moving LIKE THAT??? nahh he's gotta be possessed by the Beast cuz aint no way he'd have THAT much power
What did those animators smoke to produce something like that? Holy.
What in the Asuras Wrath is going on here
Who is she?!
...what?
Now that Angela is in the game... When is Venom getting his (not)Spawn costume?
The best I've ever seen Dare Devil look.  Who the heck is the other female character? and Where is she from?? Iron Fist comics?
IS THAT MY GOAT ALEKS LE?????????????
bro wtf is happening
Nah bro this ain't it wtf
Midtown for DareDevil Anyone? I wonder if Charlie Cox would be playing his character with his fans?
Who's the chick?
Can Daredevil actually do these things?
Any chance he’s a strategist? 😂
Daredevil versus Angela is such a random choice
What's with Angela's build? That's a little too bulky for Angela, even for Marvel Rival's standards. She's not huge or very muscular in comics, just lean/toned looking in a few, but definitely never bulky.
Stay on 2k26 grinding badges or come back to rivals?  🤔
How is Daredevil is able to fight an Asguardian? It's kinda lame giving street tier character too much powers.
How is he doing all dat
Coughing baby vs hydrogen bomb
So is daredevil being powered up by Shou-Lao or the Beast?
WTF?!!!!  This is man or woman?
Who is he fighting
Why does Marvel Rivals animation look way better than Marvel Studio's animation?
Did anyone else notice that red hand above her head after the transformation. Hopfuly it's called the red right hand !!  1:13
I wonder if they'll do the red and yellow suit as a ranked reward
Patrick Seitz as Daredevil? Did I hear the voice right?
No xbox one?
How is this game gonna run on someone’s PS4 from 2013?  Can’t wait for that instalock DPS PS4 player running at 30FPS to throw my games.
There may be only 9 supports, but sure let’s add another dps.  That’ll fix it.
Muscle mommy Angela???
Who the f is Dizang?
Why is no one talking about the PS4 logo at the end?
Who’s against daredevil
Is this matt? Or some other dude as DD as a comic variant?
Who is the big muscle mommy??
Am I tripping or is that Aleks Le
Marvel, ATP,  just make a netflix series please.   Also when is deadpool gonna be released? I really want him 👅👅
This animation! What is this!
why there a heart beat at the end of the video? skills teaser?
why i feel like this version of Daredevil like Khazan the berserker?
imma sound stupid... whose the hot one? no not daredevil...the other one.
WHO IS SHE? NAME
Animated tv show when?
Tf did they feed this Matt
Everyone is just talking about Daredevil, but who is the woman???
Why tf Valkyrie is so buffed 😭 ?
Is it just me or does this look like an anime opening
Is that Angela? Wow, deep cut for a character pick.
I know dare devil but who is she?
yo what did i j watch foo is this any anime
1:13 Is that Patrick Seitz? That roar reminds me of Jiren
Can we get more Vanguards please? There are already too many DPS.
Where are Deadpool?
Wait, PS4? Is this real? Are my dreams finally coming true?
Imma need some help from the comments, whos the muscle one winged angel lady?
his cadence sounds like NETFLIX MATT or am I tripping lol
Marvel rivals y’all cooked with this one all I’m gonna ask when y’all gonna put quicksilver in
So do we get a black screen as we play as Daredevil ?
Is that a freaking Angela? Also it may be the first chinese game where they are not afraid to make a muscular female.
How much more tuff can a game get…
Wait I haven't been caught up on anything daredevil for a while. Did he get some sort of powers other than his echo location, that makes him stronger. Because it looks like he has some powers in this trailer.
Still using Neil Gaiman's characters in big 2025? 🤔
Is that third dragon a new character or the main villain?1:33
Gameplay when?
Pause, is Daredevil voiced by Alex Lee?
if one of these isnt a tank....
Last season started on the 8th… why is this one starting on the 12th 😑
Who is that buffed dude and why is he cosplaying Angela?
Is that aleks le as daredevil?
1:07 anybody else think this looks alot like loki chained up at elbaph
What in the anime…. That sequence was so hard.
Sword of gram mentioned in dialogue this season AND Angela coming next season?  Oh yeah we're getting an AOA Loki skin for sure
Ps4 getting a port? What about Xbox One??
why tf did they make daredevil chinese??
So a tank and a DPS release?
why tf is matthew chinese?
Is it bad if i want that you would see absolutelly nothing as Daredevil?😂 Only when you hear something?
1:15 date devil ability? Look at the eye hand. He makes others blind, like cloak?
Why does Angela have abs.....
I know daredevil but who’s the other girl
Why are his eyes glowing? There’s nothing there. His ears should be glowing
How will they pull this off on PS4?
So...another DPS?
Two new Vanguards?
Are these gonna be their default skins??
I wonder what power up DD got in lore so that he’d be able to fight that other character who idc about but ik is powerful
PS4 before Switch 2? that's weird... 😅
Damn where's my lawyer at
what in the naruto sasuke fight was that holyyyyyyyyy
Another muscle mommy?
Huh, beefcake Angela is giving off tank vibes for sure, but also strangely Daredevil. Deflecting projectiles with his senses and sticks almost could be a tank ability.
Will she be a vanguard? Please?
Am i tripping or is everyone going over the fact that its releasing on ps4 too? 😭😭
Is his passive js a black screen
Why they giving daredevil this much motion 😮
What daredevil  is this??
So, that's valkyrie?
Does anyone know their voice actors?
Does that angel lady know she’s beating up a blind guy?
Can't wait to see Angela get some well deserved spotlight!  Also I wonder if Iron Fist will get a Danny Rand costume since it seems this season will have big Iron Fist /mystical city themed! 🤞🏻
Heaven vs Hell in a Dragon vs Tiger Depiction?  Yall cooking
Is the other character Aldrif Odinsdottir? Lost sister of loki and thor, firstborn of odin. If so, another obscure character, nice.
1:29 what’s that in the bottom left hand corner?
Uhhhhh is daredevil on steroids or something? I don’t remember him being able to do all that 💀
blind character, do we need to use only our ear to play him?
Can someone post a reference where DD is actually this powerful?
wait is Angela gonna be the 4.5 new hero then? if so it's time to become a muscle mommy enjoyer
Peak incoming?
So Angela clearly a Vanguard. Is DD a support? As a support main, I'm going to lose it if he is (in a good way 😅)
Why are there 2 more Duelists?
whys angelina look like that no bye full on wanna be body builder
1:35 why does it say PS4?!?!?
I wonder Kingpin reacts a this trailer's daredevil...
Ps4? What?
How is daredevil going toe to toe with her?
Angela went from fighting Spawn to Daredevil  What at a transition!!!?
Soooo why do we need another DPS after getting two last season. Angela is likely a tank and I DOUBT daredevil is a support.
Hey is their another certain character that’s Red carries to Glock and is know to be a loose also going to be added during this season as well
Wtf is this animation, please make a movie with this budget
Bro where DareDevil get all this? What comic did he do a fraction of this in??
Muscle mommies in rivals before gta 6?!
Another season without new supports? 😥😥😥
Can someone tell me who that female character is? I’m not well versed with comic so I have absolutely no idea who she is
bro why does it look like he has like super powers (beyond his senses) and lightning whip bro thats not daredevil
I know who daredevil is but who the hell is that bombshell??
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW IT SAID PS4 AND PS5 AT THE END?!!
Subtitles say Dizang, others are saying Angela.... Can she just take me now?
Are they just downgrading quality of the game for PS4 just cuz of switch 2 Nintendo doesn't care about 3rd party games and only care about there own games
is Angela a tank? is she gonna be flying? my 2nd main after Emma finally they listened ❤
Why is no one complaining that yet again we got another DPS character? 🤦
Why is daredevil fighting an asgardian
CAN WE GIVE THE ANIMATORS AND VOICE ACTORS AND THE SOUND DESIGNERS A RAISE?!
Why at first did that actually sound like Charlie Cox
That dude in red looks cool, but who is he?  “Daredevil.”  That street level glow up is worse than Tom Holland insta-Avenging.
and deadpool ?
Is the Daredevil VA Aleks Le? Aka JinWoo from Solo Leveling
All of this... just for Hela?!
Flying Vanguard??? Can I dream?
Strength build vs Dex build
Charlie Cox skin when?
Since when can daredevil go super Saiyan 😂
Is daredevil from Psylocke universe? Why does he have proper superpowers
What in the unholy name of Shounen Manga is this JoJo nonsense?  Looks cool but not how I expected Daredevil to be portrayed.
Community so toxic idk if I can re install this game
I currently play on Series S, but...  The idea of welcoming players from other generations is great, but what about the Xbox One crowd? It's a slight lack of consideration.
So Angela's the next main villain, or is someone else working behind the scenes?
What is the name of this anime
anyone willing to bet these are two dps ?
Is Angela supposed to be this buff? Wow!
Am I blind or both sillouethe looks like tanks 🤑🤑🤑
When are we getting a TV Show in this style?
Can u guys stop making everything asian themed?
Is he gonna have powers or is that just visuals for the trailer?
That's not Matt Murdock, is it? I hope I'm wrong but it looks like he will get the Danny Rand treatment
Im not pratical of comics, i know that he is daredevil but who is she?
Good lord what are they feeding these animators??  They keep cooking 😭
Did I see PS4 at the end
Who TF Is the angel🥀
Why is Daredevil's armor so... asian?
who the hell is this, this is not my devil but I want what he's having, jumped from street tier to angel tier
Who is the feather lady?
0:24 Mommy? Sorry...mommy?
Is that Angela from spawn?
Is that Angela from spawn?
When it comes crossprogresion??
Day 10 of asking to be able to purchase cosmetics from the skins like emotes or sprays separate from the skin itself
From a Hawk to a Devil, what's next for Marvel Rivals?
ayo why is angela so buff? she looks like she's 9 feet tall!
Is that Jinwoo VA or am I tripping?
WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING THIS GUYS
Is that a vanguard I see? 🎉
So is daredevil going to be a villain or the whole demon thing is just an explanation as to why he can fight against literal gods?
so daredevil blinds enemies with his ult and marks them?
PlayStation 4 but no Switch 2?
Is there a reason that Angela only has one wing?
why is lawyer just fighting god
Are they releasing game on ps4 now?
DAREDEVIL AND ANGELA THIS SEASON????? OH THIS IS SO PEAK!!! I know that we need more supports and tanks but man I love Daredevil so much!! THANK YOU NETEASE ❤❤😈😈
Is that the same DareDevil I know?? Damn...bro really said "let the devil out"🔥🔥😂
Does Matt Murdock support David Baszucki in the schlep situation?
So a Tank and a Dps ?
Sees Angela 👀  Can someone more talented than I, mix One Winged Angel to the background music? ✋️😅
What is with the impact frames 🙏
1:18 I wonder is this part a easter egg for Hela. According to the lore, she's a prisoner there so I assuming NetEase is teasing something with this since it looks like Hela's crow.
Why does DD have powers tho?
How many times you watched the trailer?  Me: lost count
Who tf is Dizang
is this Daredevil &  Angela Odinsdottir, Thor 's sister?
Wait... PS4? I'll finally be able to play it? 🥹
Neat. Did you fix matchmaking?
WAIT IS THAT ALEKS LE I HEAR???
Not even Matt Murdock what are we doing
Why is daredevil suddenly...asian...
Who is the Daredevil VA? I really like him a lot for my boy
I wonder what the story is with regards to Daredevil having mystical abilities in this trailer
yall launching this the same day bl4 comes out? lol I'll play this season late this time.
Does anyone know when the trailer for BP will come out?
Since when daredevil has those powers lol
Ps4 ? What kind of witchcraft is that ???
Me playing Daredevil when he comes out: wait why is the screen black?
My bad guys can I have dibs on the angel muscle mommy..?
Don't know about daredevils Base Outfit Looks too kun'lun like
MAN WHAT IS THIS? THIS IS SO PEAK, MUSCLE MOMMY ANGELA AND DAREDEVIL
Is this aleks lee voicing daredevil?
When fix matchmaking?
That cool and all but how about they fix the matchmaking.
Iron fist buff ?
That Dare Devil suit sucks, wtf even is that
Isn't Angela from spawn?
Maybe Dare Devil is a dual Rhienhart heart type? like he is agile but he Fights with chains. Instead of blocking his shield dodging for brief intervals. Angela might be like Junker queen that would be bad ass!! Ult seems like Groots tho.
So is Daredevil a hero or a villain?
I'm assuming this is Danny Rand Daredevil and not Matt Murdock but we'll see
Is this on ps4?
Wtf is this
waw amazing but why is angela so buffed lol? also is it me or could she be a flying hero? also can we maybe see the 1st flying tank? maybe? love the 1 wing only thing
1:17 does one of DD’s abilities mark with blind?
Another dps?
Are we gonna get a cartoon or what? These trailers are such a tease with level of animation you guys have.
isnt it season 5?
WHY DAREDEVIL ARE THE FUCKING SAMURAI????????? what is the problem with giving a character an original recognizable look?
What are these trailers omg
So, who will be the main bad guy if Daredevil is playing i that know we get a playing bad guy who was the main bad guy but the one that's we playing as is a copy
Ok, but crossprogression?
Someone do a safety check on all Strategist mains, they're about to reach 6 months without a new hero.
What happened to captain marvel coming to the game
Can someone explain how dare devil is able to go tor to toe with a very powerful asgaurdian?
bro why gotta be this hard in trailers
IS THAT ALEKS LE!?
Can we have carnage in season 5? I don’t care if it’s preplanned I just wanna play carnage
This game on the PS4?
Seems like a dps and another thick mommy tank, or thick mommy healer, and tank? Honestly thick mommy can be anything really, dare devil I don’t see being healer at all
So who's the main villain
Did daredevil always have those powers? I thought he was street level? Someone explain Please
So...does DareDevil have powers now?
1:17 what is this green?
Angela?!  if only spawn was here 😔
Crap what if Spawn is going to be in Marvel Rivals?
