Moon must've switched sides?
Shooting foul at 9:55 where the refs at ? What are they looking at ? What are they doing ?
I know y'all can play back these clips for the Refs in the Game can each Player get a challenge at 15:07 the ball touched BLUE  SHIRT, it should have been TNC Ball.
At 5:54 why did the score board go up for Nola when he didn’t make the bucket
How tall is Meech?
Caleb got 0 steals huh??
Off subject... B. Ellis forhead hella shint lol
Can we get the "ABC's"  crew onna commentary i wanna hear how scotty feel about the games as they go sometimes ‼️
Bruh is Moon TNC or not???? I’m tired of seeing him on the other side damn near every city
So yall telling me that’s not Bobby Portis?😂
what’s the point of the refs. They just watching.
Is there some sort of agreement to not utilize pick and rolls in order to more sensationalize the game?
As a member of the accountability department 2025, I have to say as a pro hooper Caleb’s overall shot selection & decision making in this run was very questionable, hats off to bj for maintaining his composure as a teammate and keeping a ‘next play’ mentality
The court good mud?
Why all the 3ps?
Why did they keep attacking Caleb in the post when it wasn’t working AT ALL?
is this the first time with 3 players dropping 20 and 10/double doubles in a 2v2?
Can I pay for this video? Take my money!!!
35:24 bro airballed and got the ball back ain't that a travel or something?
This vid is fire 🔥🔥 but when are we getting that women’s 1v1 drop?? Been waiting on that!
8:43 So did the slick floor have some to do with what's goin on with Burke?
Caleb play any games before this one? Looked like he was fighting for his life the whole time lol
Wassup with that spot on the court? atleast one slip there every game, needs to be checked out
