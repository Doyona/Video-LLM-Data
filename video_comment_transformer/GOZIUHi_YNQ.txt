What's the drama? has his anti croc suit on😅
When did we let natural selection take its course. They were just trying to warn him and he’s fighting with them.
Why do these short videos always end before the best bit?
Where’s the signs?😂😂😂😂Dude please
Why is this guy hand-paddling on a charcuterie plate?  Just let Darwin do his thing.
Why is anyone doing anything in the water of Australia? I dont do anything that Could possibly lead to a dinosaur eating me alive.
Did a hear a white South African accent on the guy in the water ?
Video of said croc eating him??
How do people travel without doing some research beforehand especially with the Internet the way it is
WHERE’S THE SIGN?! Baby nature ain’t always got signs you gotta have some buy in too!
Why are Australians so annoying When it comes to crocodiles? I'm from florida, and i too have been compelled to impress tourists with my superior herpetological knowledge 😂 but in the end nobody cares, just let him be one less goober at the boat ramp to worry about. Crocks gotta eat too
Is he a traitor to humanity for attempting to save a Karren ? Sometimes it's better to let nature run its course, nature knows what it's doing.
Who else was disappointed when a crocodile didnt appear ? 😢
where's the sign ... ffs
I dunno. That guy’s dressed like he knows better……
What is that silly looking boat/board
Maybe he is on a efoil?
Did he win the Darwin award?
Why is he dressed like a Smurf?
...and then what happened?
Is old mate seriously wearing crocks
Here for the follow up. Did smurfette live?
Abby update on this?
What is Poppa Smurf doin' surfing on an esky lid in Nth Queensland?
okay putting the crocodile thing aside for a second, what is he doing? what is he wearing?
Why would they be lying about it?!
The issue is that if papa smurf here gets chewed up then the coppers might have to chase the croc down, which is extremely unfair to the croc.
Arguing with the bloke trying to save your life?
Crocs and sharks?! No thanks
Where is the video  of him being eaten by the crock . . .
Is it wrong to hope there is a 2nd video?
Is that a efoil
Anybody know what happened to that guy did he get out of the water what happened?
Is this bloke still alive ? 😂
Where's part 2 🐊  smashing him
Is that Bob Katter trying to be croc snacks?
I need to know what happens next
Why is he dressed like a smurf gimp?
So, do we get to see the blue guy eaten in part 2?
As a species, how have we survived this long?
Does anyone else hear a distant tick tock sound?
Where’s the follow up video with the empty board floating 😮
"Where's the sign?" Signs don't stop dumb people doing dumb stuff.
Pls tell me he got mauled 🙏
What that guy is even trying to do in first place 😂
What does he think is happening - they are lying to trick him or something?
I distinctly saw two brown crocks in the video. Anyone else see them??!
Where's the part 2? ...or maybe the 2 parts?
Was he really thinking the croc had to read the sign?  Cos there’s no other rational explanation for his Darwinism
So, do you still see her (alive) today?
Is that a normal outfit to wear on a paddleboard?
What parts of Australia aren't deadly?
Where's the rest of this video and why is that guy dressed as a smurf?
Is he actually an Aussie???
Trying to what, paddleboard on a boogie board? In a wetsuit in 80° weather? Just let the crocs have him
I wanna know the ending  !   Did he get to get close and personal with a croc ?
Do you know what they call a guy like that in Australia? ................Bait.
Does anyone know how this ended?
how thick can a man be with only one head
Not sure if "North Queensland" and "common sense" belong together.
they got Americans in Australia?
Do we need people who need signs?
Where are the Aboriginal people in these Australia videos. Always British people.
Did he get the Darwin award?
Do you know where you are😂😂😂
Is that another one of our Back Packer friends?
Where is the sign?? Why must i need a sign that people put up, what of someone or the rain removed the sign just like one other tragedy that happened.
Isn't it illegal to interfere with nature in Australia? How do you interrupt those crocs meal.
where's the news report of a warned man bitten by croc 😅
Why is the guy wearing burkini?
I have so many questions. Where did you buy what you are wearing? Why blue? How did you get it on? Why are you alone? Why are you on that board looking like an absolute fool, Why are you arguing, Just why why why, How did you get to be there, on your own wearing that, I am so confused. Are you a penguin?
Is that like a blue bodysuit?? Think the crocs are owed this one..
How did this end?
What is the tourists accent? Swedish?
Okay, so where's the rest of the video?!  Did they 🐊 🐊🐊 get him?! 🤔
Pull out the seat and see if he makes it to shore when the crocs go for him
Couldn't the poster put in an AI croc to make it more realistic?
Wonder what his last meal was😂
I would genuinely like to know if that man made it back to land or not
Maybe he's from Darwin?
Did you forget you were videoing this? nice shoe.
'Where's the sign?' Why does common sense need a sign? Why?
Why even worn that idiot just start filming the croc when he starts eating them
“Where are the signs then hmm?”  “There, there, there and on every boat launch” sent me
Why do ppl record the ground and not the interaction 😒
Can we start calling Americans crocodile snacks just like we call small animals and some children shark bait 😂 and don't say we don't I was one of those young children who got called shark bait a lot because I'm an Australian woman now with an attitude
Where’s the sign 😂  Good God man
Why blur his face? I presume this has to do with Australia being woke and gay?
Anyone know if the he survived the ride?
I'm a little confused why we're trying to stop natural selection  If Bro wants to paddle out there let him paddle out there One less id10t taking up space
Is this man still alive?
Why can't people mind their own business?
I would like to see what happened next. Did the crocodile get blamed?
A crocodile in the ocean? First time for everything
I looked it up-. the water is warm yr round in this area - what's this get up he's wearing?  so he's not bitten by a 🪼 but he has no regard for the crocodiles around him though?  😃Dude is a might confused.  🐊
Does it say Darwin award on his forehead?
Can we get an update??? Did he die doing what he loves most or did he get in the boat lol
Why is the world full of idiots.
Is that a Florida man vacacationing in Australia?
Isn’t gen Z supposed to film a guy eaten by crocks
Always ask the locals first
Is he looking for Nemo?!? He’s dressed up like Dory!
Maybe he's paddling to Darwin to pick up his award?
What is he WEARING
Wheres the signs?...unfortunately crocs cant read 😂😂😂
Do Australian crocodiles have accents too?😊
Why not let natural selection take its course?
Is there a part 2 taking a blue wetsuit out of the water
Forget the crocs for a minute, what the f is he wearing and what the f is he doing?
I really need to know if this bloke survived 😂 I bet he was working on the liberal assumption if I don’t bother them they won’t bother me 🤦‍♂️
I wonder if his name is Wayne Kerr Chomp.
Where the follow-up croc attack video ? Asking for a mate.
Where’s part two when the croc eats him, I wanna see that😂😂😂😂 one less dumbarse in the gene pool
He was conducting an experiment. 😅
Where's part 2 with the 🐊 🐊 s
how do you know there's crocs in the water? All you gotta do is reach down and touch the water. Is it wet? then there's crocs there. 😂
Why bother? The Croc could use a free meal
Can’t a man get eaten by crocodiles without being heckled?
What's with the blue suite lol
Any further video of what happened?
where the croc? it is north queensland, they are everywhere, some even rent property
Why would anybody go paddling in open water with Crocodiles? I wouldn't even dip my big toe in that water 😂 Sometimes, you just have to allow Darwinism to occur, less idiots in the gene pool after the Crocodiles eat their next meal.
Is there an update on whether the smurf is still alive or otherwise?
If he's arguing after the first warning just ask him for the next of kin to contact to make it easier for them.
He's American???
Today’s top story… Have you seen this missing man?last seen at the beach In an unrelated story a croc hunter caught a salty with a blue wet suit inside him…🤔🤔 More on this and more at 11:00 🐊🐊
"Where's the sign?" He disregards "common sense" and places responsibility for his own life on a sign.
Where's the sign? The audacity of this guy is off the chart.
Who else was waiting for the live action ?
How did it work out for him?
Is that a German lol
Why intervene nature. Let natural selection do its thing...
Is there a part 2 to this ???
Can we get the part two
Where's the sign?!  Common sense is all you need.  P*sses me off these people get big crocs and gators k*lled 😔
Why do you want to deprive the crocs of their meal for the day?  That is animal cruelty.
Testing the waters of natural selection…
If I am in the sea or up a mountain for snow boarding and there is no one else around, I always think "do they know something I don't"
Let me guess, he's american? 😂
He’s wearing a wet suit in North Queensland??
Where's the sign? Who needs a sign to know there are crocs in literally every body of water in Oz?
If someone from florda or Australia tell you someone about aminals or crocodile you listen and ask if they can help get you out dont answer back or that listen they know what is dangerous when it comes to the aminals on there land
Who let the gimp out?
Where's the sign? Really love the be a fly on the wall as you're explaining that logic to St. Peter.
Why does this remind me of some special someone who is friends with a guy who really f'in hates Norton
But where’s the part where he gets eaten by the Croc? Oh it didn’t happen!? Oh you were wrong this time??
Is it twisted to say that i actually would not have done anything except ask him if he paddle boards and just have a conversation? Like its survival of the fittest at this point.
can a croc digest a wet suit?
Eer was that guy was okay though? Nothing happened? 😰 right? Anybody know the aftermath
Where is part II ?
I wonder if his board was big enough... Thinking it's not.
American tourist?
Why would anyone live in Australia where everything can unalive you.
Crocs can read signs?
Any word about his fate ? Serious question. I tried googling " man killed by crocodile while paddling " didn't throw up any bites.
i mean he is dressed like a fish aswell he is just asking for it!
Was he American like me?
What?!😂
Let me guess-an American?
Why does this guy talk exactly the same as the granddad from Bluey? Don't people have something better to do than copy a cartoon?
As if a sign means anything in Australia....
I mean...... what in the actual duck does he look like!!! 😂😂😂😂
Whats with the outfit
what is this dude even doing lol
Is there a part two? You know the part where he sees the croc and starts screaming that he had no idea there were crocs in the water.
I can't figure out if the one piece suit or swimming there was a worse decision
I thought the rule for Australia and america was......... how do u know crocks or gators are in the water? If its wet theres crocks or gators in there 🤔 😂😂
His he on holiday from Melbourne?
Is he a yank??
How has he lived that long in Australia
Why stop evolution?
Film it properly-wot are you doing
Im right, il not from here.. tell me where im. Wrong 😂😂😂😂😂😂 fwwking dunce
Well, is he still alive?😂😂😂
Sharks as well ?
Why are people outraged by this? Let natural selection just happen.
Did the nuthouse get the bloke back home ok?
Do crocs eat smurfs though?
Wheres the sign? Points out 3 😂😂😂😂
You know what the problem is??? Just keep your mouth shut
What's the Teletubby trying to do?
Did he get found by a croc?😂
What is he doing
How did he manage to reach old age 😂
Why help him?
What the fk was he even doing wearing a bright blue, full body wetsuit paddling around in tropical waters on a kneeboard?
Why is someone getting in the water in Australia?! They have crocs and poisonous everything.
"you call that a knife?" 🤠
any updates on this guy? is he still paddling around haha
I’m Australian , normally we get tourists doing this crazy kind of thing , but, is that an Aussie on the paddle board too? He gotta be on drugs 😂
I wonder the fate of the Smurf all these months later.
When you’re the only person in Australia swimming at a beach, definitely question your sense when going into that water…
where's the happy end?
What Exactly Did The Paddleboarder Say?
North Queensland, pretty croc central, why on earth would you be so careless.
Does anyone know If the man was OK in the end?
Do we have an update?! Is a crock tooth picking Smurf body suit from his teeth?!
But aren't Crocs in Australia forbidden to attack foreigners?
Is there more of this video? 😅
& he’s on a paddle board..? 😮‍💨 nah he had a death wish 😂
Did the guy got eaten or he got lucky?
I'm not sure if Salties eat Smurfs ;)
I cant make out the guys accent.. Is he from U.K. or USA? I live in USA, we have a LOT of dumb uckers as well as UK.
He looks older to, how has he survived this long 😅
What are crocodiles the one deadly animal that Aussies actually fear?
Where’s that guy from?
Why is the guy dressed like Tingle from Zelda?
Where the part 2?
What nationality is the Smurf on the board?  I can’t tell from his accent….
Was this guy aiming to win a Darwin Award?
Now, I dont live round gators or crocs...but doesnt disturbing the water to do things like paddle that board attract them?
is that a teletubby?
Hmmmm, save the guy or make a great YouTube/TicTok video on things you don’t do in Australia 🤣👍
is that a smurf?
I can barely make him out, is that a Dutch accent?
How did that fool get to his age
Hand paddling in Australia ??? He has to be daft !
please tell me he got to his senses and got on the boat
Why is the world full of iDiOtS? 😮‍💨
Why did you blurr that dodo birds face? I have to know who this genius is!!!
I wonder when his funeral is I can only assume he was eaten
I need to see a what happened next? Did he immediately get out or did he continue paddling on his knees? 😂
😮Is this for real.
Why is he dressed like a teletubby?
Did he survive?
I wonder what Happened to this guy his face is blurr so maybe he survived? But from how the Aussie was talking about crocodiles being close and pointing them out idk if he did salt water crocodiles are not really easy to survive against
having to argue....
How do you guys use the boat ramps if the crocs occupy them like that? I mean you gotta get in the water to hook and unhook the boat right?
I wanna visit Australia next year but I’m wondering how I’m gonna cope living in a bee keepers suit all the time 😂
So is he still alive this day? Or did the croc show up?
How did survival of the fittest not claim this fool in childhood?
What on gods green earth is that crocodile snack wearing!?
What is he wearing?  😳
stop interfering with natural selection. pff common sense? where?
All the crocs under the water like "duuuude..?"
I NEED a follow up on this story cause I gotta know if he gets got by a salty or not
Anybody know if their is a video of the aftermath or the full video?
How did this end ?
Is there a sequel?
Bro are you really arguing?! 😅
The sea turns green over there ?
What's Tinky Winky doing on a paddleboard. Croc or a sharks had his red gay handbag...
Is that guy Australian or an Englishman?
So what happened to him?
So did he get out or what?
LOL, is he blind if there was that many signs of crocodile warning.
Croc asking who ordered a just-eat.
Ok who has the second vid?
How is everybody ignoring the fact that someone in a blue suit is sitting on a foam board on the water?
Did knee board boy have a Make America Great Again hat on? He sounds like one.
You wonder why people die. Playing with death
Can we get an update on what happened to the guy on the paddle board? 😅
Did the croc get him tho ?
Does this count as suicide?
Doesn’t splashing the water, scare  the crocodiles?
infested waters? .. eh, mate that's its home? 🤣🤣
The f—k is that guy wearing?!
How did he make it this far in life ?
Okay, what exactly does that guy want to do on that board, anyhow? It's like the lazy river out there.
Even Oz natives have lost their lives to the dangers there, come on now… you have to argue?
"Where's the sign?" Yeah as if crocodiles read signs
Any follow up on this? Did he die? Or was his lazy river thrill ride successful?
What happened after? Did they eat him?
It’s like arguing with someone from Wano about swordsmanship
Did this guy end up getting eaten?  lol
Common sense??! Never heard of that animal before where can I find a common sense!!???
Is the guy on the short wearing Crocs?
What sort of uncomfortable ridiculous thing is he doing anyway?
Common sense? How about lack of? 😮
Croc: why is food coming towards me?
Why is the guy in the water so worried about needing a sign? It’s NQ so there are crocs in the water sign or not.
Where's the sign?   Immediately points at 3.
Is he cosplaying sonic the hedgehog?
Did he survive
Is this guy for real, when and where about this happen, far north Queensland where ? I'm Aussie just wondering when this happen.
Where's the sign? Crocodiles can't read....
Now, what was the purpose of this subpar recording?
You sure that's a person and not a crock in a blue body swim suit?
Well how much longer did he last?
Where’s the f … sign??? Hello … you w…r
What happened to him? Does anyone know??
Can’t fight natural selection, can you? 😢
What is he wearing ?
who goes in the water in australia?
Where's part 2 of this scenario?
Am I the only one who thought he was also on a paddle board
"Where's the sign?" >surrounded by signs  Darwin Award just waiting to happen.
where did he go. 🤔
Plz tell me some one got a video of him being munched the fk upppp
Is he still paddling?
Where is the idiot from probably America?
From that day forward, no one could figure out just what happened to Vern.
How can someone be this dumb? Seriously just let Darwin handle itself
Why is the idiot arguing with the local ?
The fck is he wearing? And what is he riding? And what is he doing? Tourists
And you wonder why the croc suffers...
I wonder if he catched a fish :)
Darwin was a genius. Or was he merely just an observer?
Why would you argue with someone trying to warn you about crocodiles?
And you chose to film this??  What does that accomplish for you? Like tangibly. Not by perception. 😂
So did a croc get him? Not saying I wanted it to.... but... 🤷‍♀️🐊
Oh come on I'm sure this man can get himself out of a vicious deathroll while submerged under water. Their bite force is only roughly 4,000 pounds.
Wait hes actually arguing where is the sign. 😅 holy s just let the crocodile thin the heard this guy is absolutely a problem wherever he goes on land as well.
Is he American? 😊
Did he really have to reverse hand paddle to slow his speed to heed this warning?
What's the difference between a paddle board and that other thing he was on
How’s the suit, hood and everything.
Why help him? The crocs will take real good care of him.
Crocodiles in the ocean? 😳
Where’s the croc??
You need a sign???!! Dude yer in Australia! I would check under the bed for a croc before I got in.
why did he stop filming the guy in the water. I didn't see any crocs.
What is dude doing there in that thing? I hope he didn't become croc's lunch.
Is it too hard to give good advice while keeping the camera straight?
Was that Joe Biden thinking he's Australian?😊
Did we learn nothing from Crocodile Dundee?
Is the defensive guy British?  Seems like aussies know to stay out of the water in Queensland
Did he survive??😂😂😂
Perhaps he is or was suicidal.  Does anyone know what became of this?
Are there tRUMPTARDs in Australia.
I didn’t know you get half SUP boards? Or is he on a little boogie board? Aussies naturally have good common sense, so trust them yo.
Why why why? Why people challenge life?
Do people not realize Australia isn’t a human friendly place? It’s basically another planet the way species evolved over there.
Did anyone else have to mute the video when they heard that screeching sound of a female towards the end? Like finger nails on a painted dwarf. Horrible. Aha na it wasn’t that bad. I’m joking.
wheres the sign?   one there, one there, one there, one over there, another here..🤣🤣
I would have asked a local before going near the water.
Why do you care to warn a loser when signs are everywhere?!?!?
Who else hears the Bluey theme?
What's that ticking noise?
the sort of woman that argues with satnav…but I’m guessing not anymore..
Is that guy in a gimp suit?
Was he an Aussie the suicidal guy?
Maybe he was trying to catch one using himself as bait?
Do you really have to tolerate this arrogance and ignorance? Even my uninformed 🇺🇸 self knows to listen. Your graciousness is recognized 👏✌️
90% of the video is the ground, "where's the sign?" "1 there 1 there 1 there" ZERO signs filmed. So helpful for context.
They love boat ramps?  What part about 16 ft reptiles hanging around your launch/land point expecting food made you think it wasn't a problem?
Did he survive or got eaten by the croc?
Is this bloke...... Dumb?
Anyone know how he’s getting on?
What was the outcome?😮
The Willfully ignorant are unbelievable sometimes, wonder if he made it out alive.
What is the purpose of this kneeboard anyway? Looks super gay
Did he survive?
Please tell me there's a part 2?
Is there a video of him getting eaten ?
...so did he make it ??? In Africa they get out of the car to take selfies with the Lions...it's gene pool editing, you can't stop Nature
WHY IS HE DRESSED LIKE that 😅 Grown man in a hooded Smurf suit kneeling on a boogie board at a boat ramp!?😂😂😂
What is wrong with these people?
Is the top water plug for a crocodile!
Why is he cosplaying as Tingle from Zelda in croc waters
Asking where the signs are when there's a ton.
Crocodiles aside, how is what he is doing any fun at all?
Im really not sure what that guy was actually doing.
He has no paddle? It also looks like a knee board you would ride on while being towed? It isn't a paddleboard. Very strange all around.
Common sense? 😂 Very rare those days..🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
Surely he would have only lasted like 30 mins max before he got done right?
Maybe the idiot had a death wish?
the guy on the paddle is also aussie?!🤯 just not local me thinks.
I'd love to visit Australia one day, particularly the Northern Territory and Queensland. Is it not safe at all to swim in these waters then?
Why are we watching a video of a bloke recording concrete?
How can an Australian not know that?! I am not Aussie and I know it!
Where’s the sign? As if without the sign the crocs magically vanish. They only show up when there’s a sign present. Dumbazz
Where is the sign?😂😂😂 Where is common sense?
thanks for filming the ground, because I was really wondering what you were standing on
Well?? Did he become lunch?
A whole generation born without survival instincts. I wonder how that will turn out.
are we not gonna talk about his weird method of locomotion?
How did he live to get that old?
The Australian Grizzlyman. BTW, was anyone able to assemble this man's complete life based solely on this short video? Did he have a dad? Who did he vote for? What type of work did he do for a living? Does he like to use the word 'fascist'?
Is that someone from the Blueman Group or a smurf?
Darwin Award nominee right there. I wonder if he won?
Where's Ozzy Man, when we need him?
He sounds Australian himself, maybe he's from Victoria?
Where is the follow-up vid of him getting eaten??
Am I the only one who sees a man in Crocs warning another about Crocs? Talk about the fashion police!!!
I wonder how many ppl have met their demise being this clueless
Did he get eaten by crocodile?
Does anyone else see the irony that the dude filming is wearing ‘crocs’? 🤔
What is that guy even doing? He doesn't even have a paddle and has a bright blue wetsuit on like some sort of stupidity super hero. It's like he's purposely trying to flail about in the water to attract as many predators as possible. This is Darwin in action right here.
Maybe the blue camo suit will scare the crocs ? 😂
god why can't I find my worst enemy doing that??
Did he get disabled from his last paddle out?
Was he trying to mimic a blue groper…?
"Where's the sign?" This must be the first time this guy ever left a city in his entire life.
So what happened to him, was it his lucky day 😮
Instead of admitting HE made a mistake and getting TF outta the water his ego and pride would rather chance him getting eaten alive notice HE asked where are the signs thus meaning HE didn’t fully understand the danger prior to
Just curious, is the man behind the lens on dryland?
Is he alive?
“Where’s the sign?”  Crocs don’t read the signs, champ.
Tinky Winky I presume? What is a Teletubby doing in North Queensland?
Why you even try to safe him?
Is he a migrant?
Was anyone else waiting to see a croc come up next to him? I sure was.
Was this guy eventually eaten ? That my question 😅
Will there be a Part 2?
Do crocs swim in water where you need a full suit and a hood?
How has that man made it to his age?
Does no one else see the irony that he is warning a bloke about crocs, while wearing crocs?
How can he bame the croc if he got done by it?
North Question is Wild…
When he asked where is the sign after being told to use common sense, tells me he is from victoria, this is QLD we have big mud gecko's up here 👍
Why do you need a sign? Just have common sense ffs
What is that fruity lil guy even doing? Typical “athletic” nerd type with zero common sense that thinks they are smarter then everyone else
I was walking on shark bay beach in oz and an english person came up to me with a surfboard and asked if it was ok to swim/ surf there . I mentioned that I too was english and not a local but since it was called Shark bay i couldnt honestly recommend it . They still got in 😂😂
Why is he dressed like a teletubby?
Maybe he wanted to harm himself?
He's the food source..... what can you do.
Did he make it to shore?   F
How to find out if crocodiles are in the water anywhere in Australia? Just stick your finger in and if it's wet then there's a croc inside.
Do crocs eat Smurfs?
I wanna see the rest of this and if dude changed up and listened?
What is this board?!?😂😂😂
Any follow up ? 😊
Crocs don't eat blue food, right?
"where's the sign" my dude there will not always be a sign
I wonder if he ever met a croc on his adventures.
Did the crocs get him 😬
Where's the sign? 😂😂 Jeff Fox worthy - Here's your sign. 😂😂
Where is this
Why don’t people accept their own fuckups with just a little grace?
I get wanting to help a guy out...but why record it? (Yeah, I viewed it but I thought there was something more to the video than just this)
geez, i got PADI certified there.  Was i in danger that entire time?
What even is he doing? Looks like he's on a foil board. Wing foiling without the wing?
I wonder what's for lunch.
let me guess that man was American?
Am I the only one that thought his blue suit was to edit him to be a lion, or whatever else, on the board?
Is he an American? Because he sounds like one of ours😂😂😂 his common sense is on point.
I would ask him if it is ok if I video him feeding a croc.
Do they hand out the Darwin award posthumously???
Silly that the man is paddling in crock waters and why is he wearing a wetsuit in balmy waters??
Why are so many old Aussie men so feeble and ignorant
Anyone know who this guy is or where he’s from?
Are the darwin awards being held in darwin this year or closer to where the board was found smeared with blood?
LOL who TF goes to Australia and just randomly goes off into the water??? Crocs, jellyfish, bluering octopuses, snakes, bull sharks.
That murky water gives me chills not knowing what's underneath
I wanna know what happened next 😅
Now I wanna know how this ended....!! 🤔
Who wears a wetsuit in North Queensland???
Is the Smurf from Florida?
When an Australian tells you something is safe, you give him a laughing dubious look.  When an Australian tells you something is dangerous.... you take him seriously.
What is he even wearing, and why is he KNEELING down
Not too bright is he?
What is he even trying to achieve? looks ridiculous 😂
Did he have a English accent? Or was he another Aussie? I can't place it.
What agent is that? Can anyone name it out? Sounds like a Melbourne accent to me. Anyway, just let him be. You tried.
why help people that willingly choose such things?
Why do some keep interfering with natural selection? Stop trying to chase away the crocodile's meal.
Can you put some clothes on please. It's so unhygienic to be undressed around food
He's got a knife  ? Thats not a knife. Lol how we forget
There are Karens and Darrens in Australia, too???
Is that a Florida Man?
I’m just trying to figure out what that guy is actually doing. Looks pretty uncomfortable to sit on your knees and paddle with your hands like that….
Are there no signs up??
Why didn’t he just help him in the boat instead of being judgmental and mean?
Is the guy in blue British?
Did he win his deserved Darwin Award in the end?
He's an American?😂
Is it really common sense?
What the ....??    Some kind of Darwin award taking place here. Literally and figuratively. A, "I'm not gonna listen to the locals about the dangers", gene, or something.
Why can't people read signs?
Why would u help this guy survive? 😂😂
Natural Selection?
Is that crazy Steve?
Did he exit the water?
I hate YouTube shorts. Like why isn’t there a way for me to get rid of the search bubble or writing to read the captions??
Was he trying to end himself cause.... ????
How else will gators and crocodile survive? Aren't tourists their main food source?
unless there's a sign I am safe
Did the crocs get him ? I want to blame the crocs , then I can hear more of this guy 😅😂
This should be a tiktok challenge!
Where’s the sign?😂
And why is he video taping? Are people really this brain rotted?
If a crocodile gets him, is there really a loss?
He's gotta be a kackles follower. They don't listen to nobody except their fake news stations. (This is a joke for this video, but not a joke on my country.)
😂 when are people gonna stop interfering with Darwinism? It’s just selection! This guy is so dumb that his gene pool is trying to erase itself 🤣
So did the croc get his dinner?
Is he wearing crocs?
I’m in the Netherlands. Am I far away enough from Australia to be safe from it?🫣
Please just tell me this wasn’t an American tourist🫣 bc the most ‘merica thing ever is to argue with someone who is trying to save your hide about your right to not be saved😂😂😂
Dumb man: "Oh yeah? Where? Where's the sign??"  Sensible Man: immediately points out 3 of them
The most “why are you recording this” video ive seen tbh
Who goes in the water in Australia?🤣
An australian being cautious? I would jump out of the water if I were there man.
Why is he dressed like a teletubby?
Honestly, what was his mission there? What even was he paddling on?
Ok, so what happened to him?😮
Me quietly filming until he ask. Nature documentary
Has he dressed like a sealion to attract crocs?!
An amazing video if it’s real .
Was that Sterling?😅
Was he ok???
Crocs swim ocean?
So rude! Interrupting this guy’s gHumiliation ritual just to save his life?
So what happened then?
How crazy is this guy
Why has this guy got an attitude? Someone trying to advise him on how he can not get ripped up
This guy is American, isn’t he?
Man I’m so curious where that dude is from
What are you getting upset and swearing at the old fella?
Where's part 2.?
The question is do crocs eat smurfs?
Have we learned nothing from Captain Hook?
Do they hang around the boat ramp waiting for fish?
Anyone else have the morbid curiosity to see the follow-up video of him being eaten?
Do you know if he made it out of the water alive?
Is that Steve Irwin.
Where's the sign??  THE SIGN?   You're in North Queensland!!!!!   It's basically Jurassic Park!
wouldn't even come near a swimmin pool in Australia without asking if it's save
Whys the dudes dressed up like a fish anyways lol.
Is that a tellachubby ?
Why is he paddling with his hands? Was he okay? We need an update. He should have gotten out
Shouldn't he be wearing a mask ?
Is he wearing a gimp suit?
Did that guy have a drop bear fall on his head.
Is the smurf a tourist 😂
Why post this useless video?
Is that right😊 continues to paddle towards crocodile...
Florida and Australia are distant cousins!  Bottom line ask a local before getting in the water!
What is he wearing?
Have some common sense!? Common sense flew out the windows on this person! 😂
Ok...I wonder if this older gentleman on the paddle  board has dementia.  I'm not joking.
Anyone know what happened to him?
How come this idiot can believe a sign but not actual living Aussies ??? Maybe he's a fast food delivery man!
Do you really expect someone wearing a dumb outfit like that to be smart?
Is there a part 2?
For context for our American counterparts. Just like in Florida, how can you tell if there's crocs in the water in the northern states of Australia? The answer; If the water is wet.
That's just absolutely crazy 😧 isn't it ? I mean sign or not. Ask locals and use google. Type in are there man eating crocs in Cairns 🤣 absolutely astonishing someone could be so dumb 😊
Is that coz the camera man is wearing crocs?
I mean … have y’all been to Florida
Eh, why bother? Natural selection at its finest.
Who's the cameraman? There's a dude paddling through croc infested water and he's filming his own feet. He's gonna miss the good bit!
What's the benefit of that swim ?
But what if he’s Florida man on vacation
Is he from Melbourne?
Did he become lunch?
Do crocs like blueberries 🤣
please tell me he finds the crocs.
What in the Blue Man Group is gong in here?
Where is the footage of crocodile?
Do you get the feeling his normal mode of transport is riding a pushbike in Lycra
Does anyone know if the smurf got a Darwin award
Well if he gets eaten who's fault is it?
Don't you mean the crocs hang around waiting for fish bait on paddle boards 🤣🤣🤣
From Sydney or Melbourne? Bets are open....
Please tell me I'm not the only one to notice the cam guy is actually wearing Crocs. 👏
Just ask the grizzly man how that worked out for him!!!
lol I’m fully aware of it where is the sign?
2 minutes later "where did he go"....😅
And what is he wearing??
Is this the Darwin awards?
For goodness sake dude, ask the locals before you go in their waters.... Where do you think you are?  The United Kingdom, where waters are safer? It's Australia!
Hmmmm.......a floating hors d'oeuvre for Mr Croc😋
How do you know he has chosen to be there for one purpose, a sad. Intentional, purpose.
Dude is going to argue whether or not a crocodile spotted was actually a crocodile. Meanwhile, he's dressed like a skinned seal floating around on a wafer.
Would you rather listen to one minute of free advice and have a wonderful rest of your day or have punctuted lungs and severed limbs? Like why even have an attitude?
"Where's the sign?" You don't need a sign if you have any common sense.
What is wrong with that man
is that a backpacker? visa hunter? let em be
Ever heard of natural attrition?
So did he get out then? Did he make it out in a panic? Did he get attacked and survive? Did he get attacked and not make it?.  Or were the crocodiles full that day or couldn't be bothered with taking  that blue wrapping off?
How did that guy make it so long in life?
You’ll be questioned why , save my life”Mate”
Any common sense for Palestine or you stand with white supremacy?
bro doesnt listen to the bro, but once the girl says something he agrees? whats that logic.
Where is the part of the video where he gets eaten by a crocodile?
Where's the sign? It's freakin Australia!
I wonder what happened
I wonder how well a crocs digestive tract passes an entire human plus wetsuit and boots? He's gonna need some serious fiber to move that out.
Yee matey just wondering what kind of flowers yee want at ya funeral!??
Dafaq is he wearing?
I'm not sure if that's the ocean or not but if so he should probably work Worry about the bull, tiger and great white sharks that would love the free lunch. 😅
Why is he paddling with his hands?
Whats the sign??? 😂😂😂
Where’s the “why the whites wonder?” guy?😂
so... what happened next...?
I wonder what happened to him. Did he get out safely or was he a crocs din din? 😅
"Wheres the sign??".... This dude wants to see a sign telling him swimming with silent dinosaur assasins is a poor life choice.
Unhealthy skepticism
With such bad judgment, how has this man survived this long? Whoa!
"where's the signs?" Buddy, local people in boats know more about the local waters than the government's signage department
What good is a knee board?  That whole scene was confusing. His crazy outfit on a tiny piece of foam. Croc bait!
Can we have an update please 😂?
Is that filthy frank?
Did the blue guy get eaten? I can’t imagine him getting out of that water alive.
Why is he dressed like a smurf
Is this where the crocodiles get fed?
Where's the sign?😅 Sometimes, you just got let stupidity run its course😊
Can that female in the background just shut up, she sounds so annoying.
what is that outfit hes wearing ?
What is he wearing and what is he doing 😂
"Where's the sign?" Dude, you're in a known croc region. You don't need a sign to tell you what to do. 🤦‍♀️ This is the same person who would stroll over a busy road, get clipped by a car, and then say there was nothing telling him to wait for the little green man.
Does anyone know if this floating food platter won the latest Darwin Awards?
Is he still alive?
My question is how has someone that devoid of common sense lived to that age?
What was he even doing ffs
Whats with the Beavis suit
The blue onesie has thrown me. Where's this gentleman from? I can't hear him answer.   As an Australian, I think we can be a bit too subtle with warnings sometimes. This wasn't one of those times 😂
Soo, what happened? Wish the video was longer. 😈
🙄 There’s a point where you just ask “would you like fries with that?”
Ya where the signs?😂😅😊lol
Where's the Signs 😂😂😂
Why do some folks think the signs (and rules)  dont apply to them?
Ther only signs?...what?...he for real?.??
Did that person listen or ignored the warnings.
Is that my boy @wildmanadventures talking sense?
The hell's he even doing paddling around on a knee board dressed like a Smurf
How can you not blame someone for trying to eat you?!?
The guy on the board, whats his accent? American here, they all sound Australian to me.
You call that a knife?    Now that's a knife!
Where is the next part?
Tourists, or not a new Aussie
Please why do you people feel the need to film everything and post to the internet?
Any update on this? Did the person make it?...
Did you ride from New Zealand on your stand-up paddleboard?
What is the handy cap wearing?
They let her free????? They need to bring back mental institutions
Does he want to insult him or help him? If you want someone to listen to you speak with kindness not ridicule.
Is that Joe Biden?
Where’s part two?
Wonder why tourists get killed and eatin by croc nearly every year because they ignore the signs
So did this dude make it out alive?
Really cant understand why with such great infestation of crocs there isnt a law that obligate the people to turn crocs into shoes or purses or whatever...
Where do you birth such dumba#%es?
Does this clip have a Part II we might witness?
Dang I wonder where that croc was sitting...
What is he in? Paddling with your hands?
Seriously what is this plan though? 😂 Wet suit, and... Knee board?
I wonder if he got done by the crocs in the end. ..
Was that Mr meeseek's? Existence is pain to a meeseeks
Has anyone seen the blue snack pack recently.
Did you need to film this guy just to warn him about a crocodile? I think I would’ve just told him there’s crocodiles there without having a camera stuck in my hand.
Where’s the signs? The problem with modern life, no f@cking common sense. 🙄
He is trying to save his life and he is bothered by that ???
Where the signs??? All i saw was  ground,ground and more ground
Is the Smurf on the water from Florida?
I'm sorry, what hobby is this exactly?
is he a teletubby?
Where is part 2?  🐊💨
Why warn him... just let nature take its course!
So. Did the blue Smurf end up as crocodile snack or not? 🧐
sometimes you have to question of human nature is too kind for it's own good. If this idiot wants to remove himself from the gene pool and feed a croc in the process, should we really stop nature?
Its 19th dec. Wonder if the man on paddleboard is still alive
Is it wrong that as an American all I could think was “Please don’t let this headstrong idiot be American!” (Unfortunately we have enough of those.) I was so relieved when he had a British sounding accent. 🤦‍♀️ I hope he got out safely.
Thinning of the herd?
Are swimming crocodiles more aggressive than alligators
I wonder if he made it out in one piece/alive 🐊 👀
Wait, crocodiles eat fish?!? 😂
So did the idiot in blue get attacked by the 🐊????
Did blue man lose his paddle or what?
Is there a second part to this video 😂
He British?
So did the man in blue in blue become lunch or did he have a fun day
Crocodile infested waters? It's their home.
Can we have a follow up video of the Croc having a snack?
Is that Paulie?😅
Doesn’t Australia have salt water crocodiles too that are much larger than the normal one so he could truly get destroyed if they get him
Did nature take its course?
Just ask.  " Is it alright if I film you being eaten?"
He is testing his life insurance policy!
Crocodile infested? Looks like a human infested area to me
did he meet any crocs?
"Where is the sign?"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Was he eaten? Don't shoot the croc.
Why didn’t you wait a bit, then you would have had a better video! Ha ha 😅😮😂
Did he at least get mauled?
Where’s the rest of the video where the crock took him under?
Why even pull out your camera just to videotape the ground ? 🤔
Thats not a real warning sign now is it? No its a fkkn crocodile recently seen sign mate😂😂😂
Do u know most signs are German only?
Where is the sign?  It’s because of idiots like this we have to have sign’s everywhere for every dumb thing
Just so everyone is aware, in north Queensland, people will warn you with temporally finite language like "when" or "eventually" or "later" or "will" because crocs/salties are just a question of "when" and never "if"
Why’s bro looking like an aqua Smurf 😂
What would ray gun do?
He easily outpaddles a croc on his plastic board. What’s the fuzz all about? 🙄
Why are people always trying to stop natural selection?
Does anyone know if he made it out alive?
Maybe he wants to commit suicide?.... He's clearly blue.
I'm just looking for that shadow just under the water maybe you'll see it but probably not!
Australia has Karens too?
Did he make it to smurf land?
Do crocs eat smurfs??
Maybe the gene pool needs to be drained, eh?
Wonder if he was eaten.
Isn't Darwin Oz nearby?
California?
Evan Kelmp would have just asked him what he wants you to tell his family when they can’t find his body.
2 hour's later they found his board covered in blood ???
What episode of Bluey is this?
I would have been nudging my public pretender like come on man! Object! Relivence?!?
Crocodile wondering what a teletubby tastes like 😂
This is a lovely video of the ground. Can you do one of a wall next?
Is it just me or is the guy trying to deny a big lizard a free snack.....wearing crocs? If he is...fabulous!
Is the blue man american and claiming his freedom entitlement powers? 😮
but did he get eaten by the crocodile in the end?
American tourist? They don't do great in the US at national parks with buffalos.
...was this guy suicidal?
Also, why’s he dressed up as if he is in the arctic?
Why censor there face?
get a release from him  and ask him to do tricks with his paddle board. as you film for a documentary call it happened on a Sunday.
Ahh .....Queensland? I thought this was Darwin😺
Why aren't those signs in English?...😅😂...he just wants to be on TicToc...
Liberals escaping the country? 😂
What the flip is that water sport
Is that Townsville??? God I loved watcbing the tourists up there, pulled several  fishermen of croc slides
We need an update video. Is he still alive??
maybe he boarded all the way from sweden? and he knows better?
Where is part 2
Is the “Smurf” a man? Sounds female to me. Equally ignorant!😮
Is he an American by any chance?
Why are we not allowing Darwin to work his magic?
What’s the big deal if the guy wants to feed the crocodiles let him feed the crocodiles
Crocs wondering if Smurfs are edible
Does this count as a self oof attempt? 😂
All the people saying if an Australian says “” do it, can’t you hear the Darwin Award nominee is also Australian?  Doesn’t it get cancelled out if you’re also Australian?
How have people like him survived for so long! 🤦‍♂️
Surely this isn't real? It can't possibly be ...
Is the guy on the paddle board English? He doesn't sound Australian .
Where is the sign, he must be a democrat, so ignorant people.
so...where is part 2 ?
What exactly is his “thing”? Paddling on a knee board?
"Where is the sign?"  This isnt about signs or fines man, its about not gettong eaten.
Is there the full video ?
Smart man trying to get his family the insurance money ignoring the signs and the people warning him should nullify the life insurance claim ?
Killjoys, where's the footage of the carnage.
Thats like asking the Woke libs to not be insane!!!
How you gonna ask for evidence then deny it because you don’t like it
Is that what they call "The Darwin Effect?" Lol
Why is that idiot ignoring a Queenslander??
To be honest everyone what's the issue here with some mild disagreement. I can understand why both don't want to mess around in each other's business because it doesn't benefit anyone. It's human nature and thanks guys ❤️
Which would you rather see a Salty or a White?
Why interrupt a Darwin moment?
Is that a Croc deliver roo ? 😂😂😂
Why is he mad? That are trynna save him from himself
Did he get out alive
Arguing about "where's the sign" like he can sue the Croc later for there not being big enough signs.
I never understood why people go kayaking and paddle boarding in Australia and Florida
Does the man get out of the water?
How is that a fun thing to do
Why does he look like someone's gimp has escaped?
Watching the "last moment of x" video are we?
I'm guessing his girl cheated.
If you dont care what he does why are you posting a video of it?
Why does everyone feel the need to hold up a phone before talking to someone…. and think anything they have to say is gonna be taken without hostility…?
Why’s he look like a color blind green screen worker,
Leave him there he’ll find out the hardware
Does everything in Australia want to either bite you or eat you ?
Why try to save everyone if the world is so overpopulated?
Did the crocs eat him though? I home the crocs had a full meal that day
Did the croc get him?
I really want to know how this ends
Can’t quite grasp the accent of the guy on the board? Is it another Australian? If so you would think they would know better!
Did he survive ?
Sassy the sasquatch, iz that you?
This is one of those people you look at and genuinely wonder how they made it to this age without dying yet. 🥴🥴🥴
Isn't Darwin in northern Australia?   Maybe a Darwin award candidate?
Did the croc get him?
Is the guy in the Smurf suit from the US?
So, did the croc 🐊 get him? 😮
What nationality is that bloke.
How about u warn him and help the guy ….? Maybe he’s just dumb enough not know… teach before u scold … just saying maybe I’m wrong
Maybe the guy's from Florida? 😁
Wasn't Australia originally populated with a bunch of people who lacked common sense?
Is that a sky diving suit?!
Did you get bit?  Did anyone throw in a chicken?
What is the guy even trying to do?!?
Wonder what happened afterward
And people wonder why it’s the tourists that get eaten
Is this the wokeness?
Is he from Melbourne or Sydney?
Did he get attacked?  There’s an arrogant person born every second.  Warn him once then walk away.
Where's the sign, you fkwit.
I wonder if the suit would make him taste like blueberries to the crocodiles.
Why can't we just go back to natural selection? Seriously, the problem could literally solve itself...
Are you sure this isnt Darwin.... 😂 I think hes looking for an award 😆🤦🏻🤦🏻😂
"Where's the sign?" like nature signposts all it's dangers, what an utter tool 😂😂😂
Why not just wait and see what happens? 😂
On an unrelated note, why tf was that dude in a blue morph suit? Is that usual paddle board attire?
What's the guy recording on? A paddle board?
Yo why tf did i think this was canada? Im buggin
Did he get out of the water?
Ok but why in the f is he dressed like that?!
"Wheres the SIGNS...?  "Well mate you see, the problem there is CROCS CANT FKING READ can they ya drongo....??"
What is he doing in the water to
How to tell if there are crocs. Just walk up to the water and touch it. If it's wet, there are crocs.
Be interested to know if he made it back to shore without getting eaten
What language is that? Is that English???
U think  crocs are just waiting on fish at the BOAT RAMP?  There waiting on someone like this guy.
Isnt that Joe Biden ?
Is it illegal to throw up package of hot dogs in the water in Queensland? 😅
Where the sign?.!  Where you from Sydney duck head!  Don't need a sign clown,  use you're head idiot
What's he wearing
Isn’t Darwin in Queensland? That tiny board and him paddling into croc infested waters is killing me over here! 😂 What a marroon!
Phawking knee board what thrift store did he find that aren't you supposed to be pulled by a boat with that thing
Bro thinks crocs wont eat him cos he's blue right? 🤣
I hate that he sounds american 😒 asking where the freaken signs are..not like he is going to be able to sue the crocs
I would have asked him if he can read English and he said yes then I walk away and if he said no then try my best to warn him.
Please show us your video of the croc having a Smurf snack.
Maybe he thought it was the proper name for the shoes
Is that in cairns
Is this a joke or skit or something 😂
Now what possessed you to warn him?
Where's the rest woke people
What’s the ending of this story 😂
Is that guy on the board Australian?
Natural selection?…😂
Is that a talking blueberry ?! 🤯
Why he looks like a cut finger off a latex glove?
Forgive me for asking but is their a part 2 lol
how do you know which water has crocs in Australia ?  When the  water is wet.
Can we see part two?
How do you know there's a crocodile in the water in Australia? Reach down and touch the water, if it's wet there's a crocodile in there.
Guess there isn't a sequel?
What accent does the guy in Blue have, I can't place it.
Wait a second  Can crocodile go in the ocean in Australia? Or are they on a lake ?
Is that a teletubies? 😂
Why the heck was he wearing that blue plastic tent?
Where’s the sign..? mate, you’re in north qld, that is the sign!!
Where's the video of him getting done by the Croc
What happened to him ?
What is that guy even doing
Any updates on the state of this bozo? Legs or no legs?
So if there weren’t any signs he was going to take that as a “go ahead”?
Where is the dollop video?
Isn't that guy in the water Australian?
I've seen this a few times, is there a part 2? 🙈😂
The "you can't stop me!" , "why'd you let me!!?" crowd.
Whats he wearing!?
Why are we filming the ground?
Show us what happened? Did he get out of the water, or keep paddling?
Was that a alien?
Why ya filming the ground? Really folks, feel free to have interactions without filming or posting them
Why are you interfering with natural selection?
This bloke is a LEGO block short of a set & he’s totally covered to protect from the sun. What is his point ?
Can we just not let people remove themselves from the gene pool?
Is there a part 2? I want to see part 2.
How did this man make it so far in life 😂
Alway wondered what happened to Blue Man Group.
Why is he not IMMEDIATELY scurrying back in in panic??
Was the guy American or British who was swimming
Don't you have a whole state named Darwin? Or a city. I figured you aussie had it figured out. And just let the dummies get there Darwin award.
How do you know there's a croc or a gated there?     You see the water there.  Now there and over there.    That's how you know the buggers are there!
Why don’t Aussies just avoid any water besides swimming pools same with people in southern USA or any ocean to swamp that has gators or crocs
Is he missing now? Salt water crocks do play around 😂
All I want to know is if that paddleboarder was local or even an Aussie. It's tourists I worry about in Australia as they do some genuinely reckless and ignorant things.
Why do ppl film if there not gunna show anything
Where's the sign? Must be German?
Anyone eose waiting for the croc to appear at the end??
Is that Sharon in the background there??
They have crocs in Australia? How do people go swimming and surfing? Just don't in these areas or?
Why blur his face
If he starts screaming do you help him? Or walk off with a grin? 🤔
Sure this wasn't in Darwin? It would be easier for him to get to the awards.
Do you need a sign? 😂
How to feed the Crocs in North Queensland 😉feed'em Fuggggn Muppets🫡
Bro what do you need neon lights?
Did they survive?
"Where's the sign?"  *Multiple people are concerned for your very life... This IS your fkin sign!*
The old man is asking for it.
"Where's the sign?"  Dude, no one is policing you about whether or not you're in the water. Even if there's no sign, just listen to the local guy who just doesn't want you to die.
What is the nationality of this idiot? Does he just not read Der English?
I wonder if that guy made it back to land ? 🤔
Why put the captions behind the subscribe badge????
Wow... how do you get that old without any sense?
Asking "Where's the sign?" In north QLD like he wants to be the reason for the sign 😂😂😂. Presume there are crocs everywhere you melon.
Did he get out after the croc information?
"Where's the sign"....and that's the problem with today's society
I like how he asked where the signs were and three were instantly pointed out to him.
But did he live?
Is he arguing with people trying to save his life?
I wonder where he's from? Australian? But where ?
Just chum the water. I mean why not? Guy is asking for it
what is it that makes people beleive they will be ok in water occupied by predators
Is Dad's name Darwin, by chance?
Is that another foreigner or do we have a home--grown dill in that water?
How did this guy survive long enough to get gray hair is my question
I wonder what happened ????
Another tick tocker bites the dust?! 😂
Sometimes I wonder if it's better to let idiots get taken out by nature or not. I mean if you're an idiot and do something that may get you taken out do we need to stop them?
Potential Darwin award winner?
He's middle class mate... He has NO common sense 😂! He's arguing with a local... He's right and everyone's wrong, questioning everything the nice bloke is saying😂. He can't even agree when someone's trying to save his life😂😭😭
Whys he wearing footy pajamas in the ocean
The second he started asking about signs and arguing over how clear they are id of left him for the darwin awards 😂😂😂
is that xqc?
What happened next ?
Why are these people interfering with Darwin while he’s doing his job?
Oi That's just crazy. Was he a tourist? I can barely hear him speak.
Natural selection.  Why stop it..
What blue and white and red all over?
Has anyone here seen the vid of that dead croc on the beach being eaten by a shark? The most Aussie scene evaarrrr!
The big ‘ salties ‘ 👀 out ?! He can’t be from North Queensland!? Gotta be a tourist from down south or WA. Anyone from North Qld knows about crocs
And that was the last time anyone seen him? 😂
What happened to him?
Why blur the almost Darwin Award recipients face???
Imagine meeting a Saltwater Crocodile 🐊 when paddling around on that little board ? 😱☠️
Why are you trying to save this people. Let them go.
Ok but also, how is it up to you?
Oh man, I'd be asking can I get in your boat lol. Smh
Ask an Aussie Catholic Priest, if this man dies by croc attack he won’t get into “heaven” as it’s essentially suicide to do this in Northern Australia!
C'mon mate, why intervene with natural selection?
This terrifies me. Did he make it back?
I wanna know if he even makes it to shore.
And??? Did the crocodile get a feed???
Where’s the sign? Like the crocodiles can read signs.
Why even bother trying to save someone with zero common sense that wants to argue
Crocs would be thinking- whats the catch?
But did he die though?
Wheres the sign?
How thick can a man be.
Old dudes know everything...just ask them. They'll tell you they do.
I wonder if he wanted to feed the sharkies or feed the croccies?
Why do aussie womens voice always go up at the end of a sentence so that it sounds like a question?
Is it the worst thing to just let those ones go for a swim? Especially after being warned.
Where’s the sign ………
'Where's the sign?' Like if there isn't a sign saying danger there isn't any danger, solid logic. Some people are too domesticated.
Why is he totally covered? He’ll be croc food before he gets a chance to get sunburnt! He’s worried about dying young from skin cancer whilst he swims in croc infested waters!   What a goose.
"Where's the sign?" Can't stand people who resort to that. There's no signs for stupidity (they'd run out of room).
Can’t tell if this on the verge of natural selection, or top contender for Darwinism award…
So, what was the tastiness rating by the crocs?
What the ffkk is even that...?
Maybe he wants to die?
How has this man survived long enough to be old?
Isn't there a place in Australia called Darwin?
80 years old no common sense.....how?!?
Why tf is he even going back and forth. If anyone told me there is crocs I’m OUT that water so fast
he's not going to complain about the crocodile doing him in hes gonna ask why the croc didnt follow the sign
Mind your own business? He clearly doesn’t want your help. You just want to be heard
Bro, why are you arguing with crocodile food?
“Where’s the sign??” “Literally everywhere mate”
Australia??.. No thanks.. And I'm a Floridian
How many tourists has that croc already eaten?
Are there crocodiles in the ocean?   Im from the UK, we don't erm... get many crocodiles, i was under the impression they are relatively poor swimmers.  Well, you learn something every day. 😂
Did he go to the boat ramp to launch his paddleboard?
Amazing video 😮...what kind of concrete is that?.. Is it poured. Nice texture.
What do you do if a crocodile is chasing you? Trip your mate up😮.
Infested or inhabited?
Why would he blame the croc?
Why are you filming concrete?
I wonder how a croc prefers to do a human̈ back shots I guess that's really the only way unless the croc want to be done u can just lay him down and make some shoes or purses lol. Maybe crocs just want love and not just doing people
I wonder how a croc prefers to do a human̈ back shots I guess that's really the only way unless the croc want to be done u can just lay him down and make some shoes or purses lol. Maybe crocs just want love and not just doing people
Why couldn’t you just take the American approach? Say nothing and record everything for us to see.
Why is he even arguing with man who trying to save his life?
Has any one seen my arm ? buddy your in croc water .. don’t tell me what to do 😂😂
😮😮 those salties get HUGE!! And what in the world is he wearing?? 😂😂
This absolute gronk is wearing a stinger suit, so you'd presume he doesn't want to die, but he's splashing around at a boat ramp in NQ??
Could you be anymore backward
Wheres the sign?   Every 2 feet mate
You have Californians in Australia too huh?
