Refuses to answer questions. She's not even clever or underhanded about her question dodging. She rambles incoherently and starts sentences with no idea how it's going to end. All that talking and didn't answer any single question. SMH
Who ever voted for this dumb woman?!
Harris has only five or six canned answers for any question. Fox knew this was their one shot to question her and they weren’t going to sit through the same recycled lines.
Is it just me or does that kamala Harris look drugged up? Looks a little swollen around the face.
Answer the question tell her brad no more bull
Amazing just simp,y asking common obvious questions stumps her like nothing else lol. Not used to having to answer real questions hahahahahah
This woman reminds me of Trump’s first deputy president, who also waffled and talked crap when he had no answer to a question! Typical politician lying and dodging the hard questions!
You always go around the questions
Answer the question
She can't shut up about Donald Trump and answer your question I believe you're just pissing in the wind there buddy
You couldn't answer a question straight especially a yes and no it's your life depended on it and I'm glad you're no words around the White House now cuz we can't afford for any of your stupidity rub off on it
She will not answer a question and it(she) makes me sick.
How many plastic surgeries the host got?
she has never answered a qustion shes so thick
How on earth did the USA survive so long when both President Biden and VP Harris were both completely off their rocker? Thank god for DJT 😅
She can’t ever answer one question and she’s terrible at dancing around em
What the hell happened that and administration paid, encouraged, advertised and spread the word for all to come to America.  Criminals and terrorists alike. All in the name of potential votes. Also not much doubt they got some. And they say this administration is the one doing the wrong thing.  These people are crazy.
How can someone talk so much without saying anything?
How do u never answer a question with real down to the core answers. And only point fingers and only say ur basis is that people have said. Not that stats or statistics have said. Never give a real answer and people still support this bs. It's straight bs with no real answer. How could anybody support this hypocrisy.
How can anyone believe her when she did nothing during her administration.
Boy. Did we dodge a bullet, or what?
And people still seriously wonder why they lost so badly??!!
What if she had won? They are frustrated and I get it. Freaking dummy?
She never wants too answer the question
Did you fall out of a mexican coconut tree?! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
She never answered a question, pure garbage
Her ultimate failure in this interview is her reluctance to answer a question  directly and to instead focus on Trump. Not only did it leave people feeling like she had no solutions but her fascination with him in place of solutions actually served to bolster Trump because it made her appear to be inferior
What is with yelling?
I don’t hear her answering a single question 😂🤡🤡🤡
Are you siding with the middle east and cloaks
I wonder why she lost every swing state,the popular vote and thank God  the presidency
Kamala Harris as Warren Harding without the win. Each question-Zero Direct Answers. My LORD America dodged a bullet just like our Great Leader did!
😂😂why is the comedy? This is better than SNL I feel like I'm watching the Dave Chappelle skit
Is this real?
Why is there a common tactic of talking over people by some Trump supporters? Is this done on purpose? If what they are saying is true then why do they have to talk over people? Everytime it happens.
What’s the difference between Biden and Kamala? Biden had a brain, he just lost as he got older, meanwhile, Kamala never had a brain in the first place😂
Who's here in May 2025?
5 MINUTES ON QUESTION 1 BECAUSE THIS MORON WANTS TO DISUADE BRET FROM THE TRUTH.
😂that women don't know what she talking about. She can not answer a question.  It's funny how she getting pretty upset because she can give any answer to Brett.  I'm so glad she did win. Thank God.
When did she even answer one question ❓❓❓
How was she a lawyer? I never heard substance from her!
When has Trump ever turned the Military against the American People? 🤔
She dances around every question 😅 what a clown
Don't You Mean "Former" Vice President??? And An Evil Woman???
Why cant she just answer the damned question lier
She can’t answer the question!!!!
Question at 21:00 is just beautiful her face says it all 😂😂
What’s up with the Catch and Release ?
Brett asked 10 questions and Kamala never answered a single one
She just can't answer any question.
She can't answer that question because the fact is the biden-harris administration had the open borders they allowed all sorts of illegal criminals to come into our country and this is why Kamala Harris lost the presidency thank God for that
Kamala would not take responsibility or answer a direct question but consistently changed the subject to Trump
There is not a single question that this woman can answer, she always goes off on a tangent, she tries to find justification for everything with that gibberish she talks about and then ends up blaming Trump. I can’t stand her not answering and keeps rudely interrupting!! Get her out!!
Her calling trump unstable when she can't even answer a simple question yes or no.
Brett, said Trump sped spent $20 million on that ad but she spent almost 2,000,000,000 on ads so what’s your point?
Has anyone noticed that she wore the same earrings in every interview?
Slimy snake couldn't even answer one question in a straight manner
An she wonders why she lost.
All she wanted to do was run out of time, talk slowly and make long sentences, he tried to go through lots of questions to be answered and all she did was run around.
What’s wrong with you people? Why are you talking so fast?
Haha. Answer the question. Oh no you can’t. Thats why the dems lost!
she can’t answer even ONE question 😂
And you wonder why you lost. Bye-bye loser😊
Kamala Harris dances around questions that she is clueless about
Seriously how or why was this the best Democrats could come up with. LAUGHABLE all year long
I don’t know why she can’t give a straight answer to any question she’s asked.
Did she mention the children of the community?
Have the dems even watched this? Sheesh.
Thank God this looney didnt become President. She cant even answer a question.
When did the imagination system become broken? Can anyone tell me? It worked for years and years but now somehow it is deemed broken. I say this is a false argument. It’s only broken in a sense that the democrats can’t get these immigrants legalized fast enough so they can vote for Socialism!
Lots of words that amount to nothing half way through it I forget what the question was and what is the answer she’s giving.
Where was she on the night of the election when Trump won and she never came out to address it and her supporters!!
lol she gets mad that he's interrupting her RAMBLING and NON ANSWERS. He asks a simple question, how many immigrants were released? She speaks for 20 seconds and doesn't say a number. This whole administration is a joke. Zero transparency. Zero accountability.
Why is this woman not in jail ??
She won’t answer the question. Imagine that…
Is she talking
Why sit there and listen to a first class lier
She never answered the question.
80 pages on her web site?!? , she had her chance with Bret
20 million on an effective add as opposed to Oprah getting 100 million for what?
20 million on an effective add as opposed to Oprah getting 100 million for what?
Not a single straight answer for all those questions. Pathetic knowledge about the world.
Ounce again she can’t even answer a simple question but people still voted for her
Who’s here in 2025 January?
How can the sky refrain from telling her to shut the hell up and answer the question
Can you imagine if she won?
Answer the question!!!!!
How many times did she Donald Trump??
The requirement for answering the question involves a number.
But how many. The question was how many people were released.
When asked about Joe's mental faculties she refuses to answer and says Trump's name 6 times.
Why on earth did Americans support this thick slagbag
ANSWER THE QUESTION, FIRST TIME CALIFORNIA  STATE  BAR  EXAM  FLUNKIE
This first question really highlights what was wrong with Kamala Harris as a candidate, All talk and no results.  It would have been an easy win for the Dems if the economy was doing well.
So will she follow the law when trump locks her up for hate crimes ?
Does anyone know, that she was very late for the interview ( rude) and then her people cut the interview short. It was not Bret , it was all Kamala’s people. They knew she would be in trouble .
She did not answer the question gender in prisons
I just can’t !! Listen to her anymore. Madam vice president this gentleman gave her every opportunity to answer an honest question and she couldn’t even do that. DISGUSTING.
Look at her face 😮😮she just doesn’t GET IT!! Just answer the question!!!! OMG.. round and round and round blah blah blah.what a disgrace 😢😢
Kamala Harris is really clueless. Is she being for real? 😮
Omg who else sees the devil horns on her head.
She is full of it. Answer the question
Why are you so angry when you talk about President Donald Trump??
She simply changes the question and won’t allow him to keep on the same question.
16:04 finally someone asked this
This is better than watching a comic sketch! Asked the question to explain three and half years of failure and she goes 10 years back to Trump. This has been a diahorrea of words in response to Brett's questions that are empty of substance... The hands flying everywhere in response to the questions are a clear demonstration of the fact that she has not got the answers we needed to hear.
She can’t even answer the question
What happened to her fake accents?? 😂
How did she ever run for any office??!😮
13:34  Horns?
No point for the questions
I love how Brett leads with something she said and then addresses her with a question that exposes how hypocritical she is lol
Every question kamala Harris answers was word salad. All kamala Harris answers was Beating around the bush..🍿🫢🧋
How could anyone watch her and say “that’s my president” like I don’t get it how can you want her to lead the country?
Harris is such trash ! Not even a single direct answer for ANY SINGLE  QUESTION LET ALONE NOT ANY APOLOGY FOR THOSE GIRLS ASSAULTS AND DEATHS. 🎉
How can he look at her and "act" like he understands?
It’s not just Kamala that can’t answer simple questions it’s all politicians.  It’s classic.  Most politicians do respond way better to where you kind of walk away almost confused and never getting your questions answered.  Kamala isn’t a politician she is a prosecutor.
She can't answer a simple question that any 3 year old could, and this is the puppet that the establishment is trying to elect?
She dodges questions like Trump dodges bullets. So satisfied she lost.
11:09 not one question answered 🤣🤣🤣
0:25 first question she didn’t answer. lol. Can’t give a number. Classic.
More like going around the questions with little answers 🙄
Why didn't she go after Obama for spying on Trump's campaign and wiretapping Trump
How come you just can't turn them away at the border why do you have to let them in and let them talk to judges put the judges on the border
The only grilling these leftists have done w her is ask her what she wants on her burger at the cookout.  She is a big liar and is fake as a see thru door
Good job Brett. U have to keep asking the questions to get the answer she don't like to tell you upfront you have to work it out of her. Before you see her lies
Any question why she lost 😂
Is she delusional lol 😂
She peppers the host with word salads not an answer
Where all her stupid laughs???
Salute to the host for asking the questions that matter and sticking to it like glue.  He had her on the ropes and all her pretension was knocked out to reveal the true nature of the candidate
Why would anyone vote for her after listening to her talk for 4 years, I listened for 20 minutes and I knew she was not qualified and then there’s that she’s ignorant
She never could answer a simple question
She can't or won't answer questions! Unbelievable....
She says “ let me finish responding” but he’s asking for a number not an excuse
She says nothing , what she was on thinking she was gonna be president 😅😅?
Are those ??!?!??!$&&$?, wow
English, motherf*cker, DO U SPEAK IT?!?!
Just love ❤how he ask questions
Asking that woman a question is asking for an answer 43 business days later. She still doesn't know anything.
You think she'll actually start working at McDonald's now?
I don’t think she answered a single question directly
Can u imagine whay wouldve happened if she won?
She is frustrating! 😤 Answer one question! 😤 😂
Using taxpayers dollars to change illegal ppl’s body? 😂 girl goodbye, good night go to bed
Kalamatoe just talks over every question
Why her staffs do not do homework ever? Or should she do some homework?
Why her staffs do not do homework ever? Or should she do some homework?
The f you say?
Is not letting an interviewee finish talking normal?
This woman is incapable of a cognizant thought or the ability to answer a question.
How the hell did she get to be vp??? She a moron and doesn't hold true to anything she says😊
This lady as smart as she’s meant to be  Oh boy oh boy  She gave me a headache just listening to her not being able to answer questions that she should know in her capacity
So when is the media (not including this interview) going to blame themselves for Harris' defeat?
I've yet to hear an answer to ANY question he's asked her 😂🙄🤔
Her best attribute is her ability to duck dip dodge dive and dodge real questions from those who won’t accept prepackaged talking points as an answer…
did she answer any of the questions....at all?
Why is everything one sided with Israel something is wrong
How much money did Kamala give ?
Can anyone tell me, why don't she just answer the questions she is asked, and not give a word salad? I'm getting frustrated!
she's such a smuck. Makes me sick just hearing her voice!!!!!!!!🤢🤢 avoids every question he asked.
Hmmmmmmm... who would that enemy be within???????????
And NOW THIS FEMALE IN OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACTUALLY DIPS RIGHT OUT OF THIS HEART BREAKING QUESTION CONCERNING A DAUGHTER OF GOD HAD HER LIFE TAKEN FROM HER. HARRIS WON'T EVEN ANSWER THE QUESTION .  DEAR GOD HAVE MERCY ON HER SOUL.
The question was how many illegal immig. Were allowed into the country
Is she still answering these questions?
This stupid woman is playing dodgeball with the questions. That’s why she won’t go on Joe Rogan because she will get deep fried.
22:56 how did this woman make a vice president
Why does nobody ask her about the actual weaponization of the DOJ and FBI when she goes on those DT derangment rants?
It's the dance around the questions fa me 😂😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♀️🤡
It's the dance around the questions fa me 😂😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♀️🤡
Always dodging the question.
She literally did not even answer one question
What a loser!!! 🤣😂🤣 Please Answer to a question !!!  What you saying?!!!
“Let’s get to the point “ continues to dance around the question asked
My question is how did she manage to get so far all this time?
Just give the estimated number instead of dancing around the question. She is really good at wasting time instead of getting a direct answer.
Why can’t she just answer the question 😮
So unfair how he cuts her off every time she answer a question.
Why won't he let her speak ?
My God….. how is she even running for office in this great country?
I wonder when did she nitice bidens diminishing mental capacities..   wont talk because she knew and covered it up....she is a LIAR
Her body language suggests she's not comfortable with the questions
To not offend the wokies, she just avoids any clear statement. No position on paying for trans surgery.
How many people she blow to become vice president in the first place? She’ll probably blame trump for that too what a disaster of an interview
She hasn't answered one question
who is the first time oversea voter who voted for Trump here?
Try to answer a question without mentioning Donald Trump. Difficulty level: Democrap
Props to the interviewer's wise and smart questions
Do all the Democrats do is talk?? What is she even talking about?
Asking her to answer a direct question, is like asking your wife or girl why didnt you come home lastnight 😂😂😂
She didn't want to talk about any of his questions
can’t even answer the first question😂😂😂😂😂
Can’t answer a question straight up they all cap 🧢😂😂😂😂
Pathetic. Great to see a Democrat being asked a decent question and get the same treatment as Trump.
Can we grill TRUMP on gun laws? Democrats have this weakness but Republicans have their on weakness. I just pray both can come together to do the right thing on both issues.
Dumb broad can't answer a question and keeps blaming trump lmao she shouldn't even be in politics
Asking about what you did lady not donald trump issue here. Come on answer the question and focus on your plans
She can't even answer a question. Embarrassing.
What the f is she talking about didn't get a single word she said.
Take it easy he’s asking you a question and you getting out of the question you I thought you are smart little bit you know you can do some movie but now I feel you are nothing even babysitter you’re not good for that you have a great day Camila ha ha ha
Who’s here after this Slag lost? 😂😂
Can anybody tell me why people, news reporters, keep saying that Kamala is black?
why was dude cutting her off like that tho
This is what she didn’t win she couldn’t answer one question
This woman is insane. She never answers a question.
What does she mean by broken immigration system?? Im confused! Does she mean they don't have swifter way of allowing people enter through the airport or does she mean the walls on south are too high to climb??
My Gosh ANSWER THE DAM QUESTION!
She never answers the questions. She be getting me mad.
If she did all that for the border, why did she criticize Trump? She’s so full if it.
See this what Fox News..interrupt interrupt..ask a question, interrupt. What a joke new station😂
He never let her finish the question that he asked
Does he actually hear her. All I hear is him interrupting her the entire time and not actually listening.
The audacity to not answer a single question. And if pressed playing the let me finish card. She should be pressed even harder.
Why does this guy keep interrupting her answers?
She is allways come to Donal Trump do this do that and she doesn't answer the question , she's manipulating everything she's ask, and don't give an answer..
She is allways come to Donal Trump do this do that and she doesn't answer the question , she's manipulating everything she's ask, and don't give an answer..
Nonsense never answers the question directly- no way  she can represent America
Is this real life 😅
"do you feel like you owe them an apology" "let me just say im sorry for their loss" lets talk about this instead. 💀
Why isit she uses trump as excuse for her problems america wants answers not excuses
Did I just see horns pop up
yall saying shes not answering the question but he continues to cutt her off 😂
I love Brett’s lil smirk every time she gets flustered because she can’t answer a question 😂
Do Biden and Harris just block out how they opened the borders come one come all, when she all nasal talking through her a** how can people not hear and see the lies, Trump put the border policy in place on the first day Biden axed it.
She doesn't have the direct answer in every question she don't do her homework
she did not answer a single question! ugh she makes my blood boil.
Why does she think Donald Trump is so awful? Why does mainstream media hate him so much? He's a great person
I came to this interview as an undecided voter. VOTING TRUMP now
Just answer the question you were asked
She literally skipped over every question 😂
Why is she winning …
Idk what she trying to pull but her agenda is not good she has no interest in american people I'm starting to question is she even american??
what the Fu  is she rambling about?
She never answered one question im still waiting for one answer 😂
Why does kamala sound like she's on .85 playback speed and ask for let me finish
At least the tries to answer questions, unlike Trump who has dodged every tough question for the last ten years, by telling the reporter how nasty he/she is.
Answer the dam question you fkn scumbag. How the fk is she even sitting in that chair.
Why does Brett feel the need to talk over her while she is in the middle of responding? I get she liked to deflect all the time but Brett cutting her if just outright rude and disrespectful imo
Kamala? Is she only half American and half Latin or what? The name Kamala?
Is this real??
Y her answer got to be a long paragraph, instead of precise direct answers and puttin' more ppl to work at the border 🛂 is her solution?
Does she even know how to answer a simple question 🧐👎👎👎
All she can do is deflect to avoid answering questions.
Why when she’s asked a question does she always talk about him dang?
this witch never answer the question her tactic is to ask a another question to the journalist,
What if Everything she is blaming Trump for- is actually her.
Why didn’t she go to Joe Rogans?
Has anyone checked on those 6 democrats? 😂
Baier is a nasty son of a gun asking very tough questions, as one should to a Presidential Candidate. But my God was Harris unprepared.. The one thing she has going for herself is being able to answer a question poorly with a straight face. That's harder than it sounds.
Why does Fox News let Democrats come on and push their views. Giving them Air Time is WRONG.
What new ideas has she said?   What new generational ideas does she have?
Not even one accurate answer why ?
How can anyone with a clear conscience vote for this person
She can’t answer one darn question!! All she does is talk bad about Trump lol
She never answers the question 🤦🏽‍♀️
I don’t get it. How does she have? So many people Fooled you can see right through her is it just they don’t want Trump to be president? Do we really want her to represent our country that’s not even my biggest concern
She can’t stop interrupting him and she does so because she’s mad that he is redirecting her to answer the question that she avoided
Bret Baier’s direct questioning nearly made Kamala Harris cry.
Who will help me here financially please
Why almost all US politicians are vile? This is an honest question.
Right off the bat: "How many illegal immigrants do you think has entered the country?" "I agree with you"  Tf are you agreeing with he asked a question
Why aren't they talking about Trump threatening Liz Cheney, Why are they making Trump sound like he's a good candidate for us? These people should be ashamed of themselves
This is her strategy. Try to talk around every question then get mad when asked to answer the question.
Why did you allow them released? No excuse.  They have the power to keep them in Mexico.
Question: What's 2+2?   Answer by Kamala Harris: Let me be clear that Donald Trump is a threat to Democracy and will prevent people from solving basic math questions 🤡🤣
How does she get working around the clock? I wish her Senate attendance record reflected that work ethic
Is talking without saying anything a requirement to be a politician?
He calls her Ma'am why doesn't she call her Sir ?
If she thought Biden was so good why did she take his place Democrats have no shame
Getting a straight answer out of her is like pulling teeth
Why can’t she answer a straight question.
Where is she going to come up with $25,000 for down payments for new home buyers? Hmmmm 🤔🤔🤔
She had 4 years to fix the problems what has she done?
Fox news .your balance is questioned.   Their expertise is propaganda  and profits
Does she know how to answer a question without blaming Donald trump?
This dude is not asking questions to understand. His questions and interruptions are designed to attempt to discredit and undermine her attempts to answer. She brings up valid points, and a willingness to work together. But y’all don’t care about that. That first question  shouldn’t have lasted more than a few minutes at most.
Did she actually answer anything? I tried my best but I couldn't help zoning out.
Hey kamala, I have a question for you:  Her: Let us all be clear that meanwhile you have a question, I will only answer what I think fits the answer because we have been very focused on the topics of the people bla bla bla bla blaa……..
Not one answer to anything
She never ANSWERS the question. Her responses are filled with details about the issue with solutions they have supposedly implemented or attempted to implement. She adds so much filler talk to cover up her non responsiveness including what seems to be uplifting rhetoric but does not present a solution or clarify her stance on the issue.
She will not answer one question directly, You can tell she is a lawyer, Example, Acknowledging the question: You can acknowledge the question without answering it, or you can acknowledge it and then bridge to your own point. For example, you could say "Yes, I hear what you are saying, but I think the key point here is XYZ".
This Koala looking VP talks a bunch of word salad. ANSWER THE QUESTION!
Why haven't you fixed it?
She's running away from the question. She only focused on election!
She doesn't even understand the questions
How about china ask about china
If biden was mentally competent why is kamala being inserted as the democratic nominee
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodging direct answers to questions.
This fake ahh bih couldnt answer 1 question with out tagging trump shaky ahhh , like I’m so glad I voted for trump today , this has to stop 🛑
He is a terrible interviewer
This female dog won't answer a question I don't understand how the greatest country in the history of the world is being lead by people like her why do people vote to put people like this In charge of things I don't know why anyone would listen to her and say let's put her in charge of my children's future insane
(Yes or No Question): Her: I came from a middle class family…  Yes or No? Let me finish… Yes or No…. I was beginning to answer the question… YESSSS OR NOOO?!?   These politicians really don’t know how to answer a straight up yes or no question….
The point is answering the fugging question, which is something these "ideyots" do not know how to do. Also I'm noticing that they do not like the exact same treatment that they give to Republicans when they are being questioned.  We all know they're the problem! We know as much aa she knows that what she's saying is bs and the only reason she's saying it on national tv looking even more dumb is because her followers don't listen to anything but the crap coming from her mouth.
How is putting illegal aliens up in 5 star hotels and giving them free money addressing a border crisis?
Why does she never answer the question she’s asked? And did she forget she was in the White House the last 4 years? Trump was the president 4 years ago smh.
Literally could not answer a single question
She's horrible at answering questions
Why does it take her so long to answer a question
She can't answer a direct question.  Reminds me of my ex wife.
Why she look like that thing off of Star Wars.
i hate it so much that no politican can give a honest answer to a specific question, always talk around
thf is the chips of science act?????
When did he say all that???
Kamala: why can’t you just answer the question?  “Will you have tax payers pay for gender transitions for prisoners?”    We all know the answer is “yes”.  Do you think we are stupid listening to you go on and on evading this question?
How are those who don't have Internet going to see those documents
She puts as many words as possible in every sentence she speaks.  Reminds me of the essay questions in my 6th Grade. 😂
“will u support this?” it’s a yes or no question.. by saying “i’ll follow the law” means yes. so just say yes
Anybody else have luck in job interviews “answering” questions like this?
Who’s got the Ranch for the word salads being thrown out
Did anyone tally the number of times she mentioned Donald Trump? I would do it myself but I can’t sit through this again.
Is anyone having any clear idea what is  her plan and what she wants to do and what she did not do as a vice president or a future president ?
Why don't you then just explain your economic policy then? Oh you have no real answer.
at 25+ minutes her word salad is embarrassing - how did she this far...?
Not sure if she understands how to answer questions 🤦🏻
So, ask a direct question, and instead of getting an answer, we just get a generic "I will follow the law" over and over, without any indication of the actual answer. Got it.
I thought Journalism was supposed to be unbiased questions seeking the truth. That first question was disgustingly disingenious
Interviewing is still like interrogating prisoners, the questioner is cowardly
She is so full of 💩 . How many times is she going to interrupt and avoid a question?
Finally!!!! Some tough questions for her 😊
What a disaster … she couldn’t answer one single question
Are people seriously voting for her? I’m not American btw, just curious 😅
She can't admit her failure and is still not answering the question. She dances around the question as usual. Her lip service salad babbling fool. Smh...🙄
Why did you open the border, still hasn't answered the question.
Such a f liar, answer the question
Change your name to Ginger Rogers she dances around every question at least Ginger Rogers was good at what she did and she had nice legs doing it Kamala is just a street hoe at 25 cents of Pop they want change back
This person is winning 50% in the polls?
She never gets to the point or answers questions with credible ideas. 😢
Begining to answer the question by not answering the question?? 🤔🧐
Wait what? Turn the page on a decade of trump? This lady cant math
What accent is this now?
Didn't they lock protester 1 6 2020
Where are all the woke teens from jubilee??🤣😏 if you choose to be blind by this interview jokes on y’all 😬
She can't answer the question
TRUMP / VANCE  the grammar is atrocious! So are the excuses for lack of accountability! Does a Leopard change its spots ? 25th amendment yay or nay?
Then why are you flying them in and letting them vote for you
R u 1 or 3? Who r u in ur professional life and personal life? 3:41
Is she crazy how can she make stuff up and lie like that about Trump and expect to be president
Ok what is the plan
Laughing is not an offer to help the american people for housing.... What does she think she fell off of a Coconut tree??? 😂
Wonder why kamala Harris simply didn't taken a hardline stand ...just like Trump...She just watched by when immigrants pouring in.....when the presidency had so much power...to halt it...
She can’t answer one question !
Politicians just like lawyers do not answer T/F questions because they understand that media just take headlines, which most of the time is taken out of context.
Honest question, in all the things that came out about Project 2025, why are you ladies voting for Trump?
Can anyone ask what those plans actually are? It seems thatvtheir plan is to have a plan.
Look she can't even answer that one question and this is what ppl want as president
She can't answer 1 single question without laying down a layer of manipulation first.
She can answer simple questions,Donald Trump please save this country 🙏
Why does a presenter think he can talk over people?
Such strong questions and such BS answers….
What a waste of time. She continually side steps the Questions with word salad nonsense.
This host is debating not interviewing
She can answer questions only by teleprompter and she laughs like a mare
She scrambles every single time she is asked a direct question.
Grilled ? Not at all
HOW DO YOU CLAIM TO BE A LEADER AND TAKE NO ACCOUNTABILITY??!!
she doesn't answer any of his questions and talks so slow I can't even watch this.
Why can this woman not actually answer a question that is put before her.
How do you feel about trump plain to cut medicare and social security?
The heffer didnt answer one question,,just attack her aponent
Yes of cause Kamala can't answer the Question.
While Kamala tryng to answer Question
Why are u asking the repeated question of course she can’t answer saying Joe Biden is mentally unstable too even though it’s true that’s why she is running mate, are u expecting her to acknowledge u that her boss is unfit. 😂
Still waiting for the answer to his fiest 2 questions!
How do you have penalties for a legal crossing when you’re allowing everybody to come in?
what a disgusting disrespectful interviewer. There are ways to ask question to make a point. he acts aggressive and took it over the top to not let her answer - beyond misleading. People wake up and use common sense- this is ridiculous and embarrassing for all of us American people.
Kamala Harris is non-answer responder in Chief
She is very determined NOT to answer the questions.
my big question is why was she yelling like a kid having a temper tantrum
this is legit the first interview shes done in office with real questions
"So, what are you turning the page from?" 😂 That instant when he fried her... 🤣🤣🤣
Why ACCEPT depravity from him but EXPECT perfection from Kamala? We are better than this.
How did this video get over 100,000 comments and not the ones that debunked the January 6 narrative from the liberal media or the ones of the presidential debate?
She can’t even answer the question
sooo back to the 1st question... what's the number?
Yes of cause Kamala can't answer the Question.
While Kamala tryng to answer Question
This interviewer kept on asking questions that attacking vice-president Harris and would not let her finish answering the question. No positive question at all. This is meant to attack her. She is so brave and wise for attending this interview.
Was this a Saturday Night Live skit!😂
What about Americans that don't have a license, scumbags Harris
Kamala speaks like a kid taking a Pop Quiz and they don't know the answer, but know how to use filler words and emotion-type answering.
What was Harris doing all the time she was in office?
This is her moment to answer questions, but she keeps deflecting, bringing up Trump to avoid answering questions🤔
Why does she talk like a recording?  Why democrats like to hear the same stale rhetoric?  Everyone can repeat her words by now. She will do nthing for 4 years - she has no solution. She's the one playing politicl games. Good thing Bret keep bringing in content.
She never answered the question 🤔
who will vote for this trainwreck????
Please will you answer a question please.
Its disgusting that you disrespect and ignore these questions from an honorable News Man and you're so inept that a solid, educated, honest answer is impossible
This woman wouldn’t know what to say if someone asked her what color the sky was
She takes ten minutes to answer a simple yes or no question.
Let's get to the point.... okay answer the question harris
She never answered the question
“Do you support illegal trans operations”  “I will follow the law”  No spine No guts to answer a question
It would be nice if she answered one question
Just how many times did she mention Donald Trump during this interview? & what law do we have on the books that says male prison inmates are entitled to funding for transgender surgeries?
What a horrid interviewer this Fox&friends guy is!!  How rude to ask a question -- then just talk right over Harris. Irritating--
How can  someone talk so much and not talk with answering common sense talk
All the question he ask her she didn't answer 80% of it, she is after Trump. Every answer let me talk about Trump is Trump he ask her? Infact this proves to me that inwardly she is full of lies.
My only question is why did we have to wait for another dem to get in office for changes? She keeps saying our plan..... your plan has failed us the last 4 years.
If Iran is americas biggest enemy, why is she giving billions of American workers tax dollars to them.??????????
Brett is such a great interviewer❤
She never answered the actual first question
How did this clown get so far 🤔
Did she even answer one question?  Like really answer the question, not go off on her own tangents?
What gaslighting this man did to this woman?  I don’t care what side you’re on but if you care about people, you will see that this dude was messed up.
Strengthen small business?? This administration can’t even send a single mom on low income her fkn tax return. She’s full of 💩.
Very first question,  "Let's get right to the point" By not answering the question and completely avoiding it.  She's can't get elected or this is going to get so much worse.
Where are the children pedos ??????😮
What plans?
A better follow up question to Kamala's non-apology to those families would be, "How would you feel if that was YOUR (step)daughter who was murdered due to your border policy? Could you forgive yourself?"  Saying "Sorry for your loss" is NOT an apology because you're not holding yourself accountable for your actions that led to their murders.
First 3 minutes in she said "let me finish" and all she did was not answer the question and go around and around in circles.
Why do you spend the majority of her responses describing and lame ting over Trump??? Just tell us whet YOU are going to do, how YOU ate going to help US, talk to us about US Kamala. We're listening...we keep waiting to hear.
And not a single question was answered that day ...
Answer the question!!!!! Jeeesh!!!!! She is awful!!!!
Biden has been unfit from the get go 😂 why has she got this obsession with trump I think she has a crush on him treat them mean keep them keen 😂❤
Who is voting for this lady?
Answer the question why attack trump it's not about him right is about you and how you will do your job right 😂😂😂😂 she's funny
Why do we have to take all these immigrants why do they get to pick and choose what country they pick asylum in
Q: Kamala, could you explain to us what a coffee mug is used for? Kamala: Let me be very clear... Donald Trump.
It is always the same thing with this clown. She will never actually answer a question.
Kamala keeps deflecting the question or changing the subject lmao To be fair though, Trump has done that a fair bit, but the degree in which she does in this interview is Mega Cringe. I can see the frustration on the interviewer twisting in frustration
Just answer the dam questions how hard is it
How did she make it so far 😮
She always avoids answering the question because she has nothing good to say about anything she’s done or not done
Where’s the language barrier? Is it because she doesn’t understand any questions?
If her plan has been given the tick, why doesn't she tell us what the plan is.
I am literally traumatized by Kamalas voice it hurts to listen to her speak. Can you please just answer a question without a paperclip on your nose and more so can you just answer question like a normal person. Just one reasonable answer..
This so called interview was very unprofessionally led by the Fox-interviewer. His interview tactics appeared rather like an middle-ages inquisition than a balanced dialogue, where the questioner basically gives time for a complete answer. Disrupting VP Harris mid-answer is a clearcut evidence that Fox still sticks to MAGA-loser-traitor Trump, since Trump has already announced that he will go after Fox and the Murdoch Clan, once back in office. Fox acting as lickspittles just as we are already used to know them.
Did she answer any of the questions ?
Talk number awnser his questions
She literally cannot answer a single question.  Dances around it or says wellll donald trump this and that blah blah blah Yada Yada
The point is ... Im going to divert the question and salad it
Finally, follow-up questions 🙌
The point is , answer the question!your first stop bla bla bla bla bla!
Does Kamala know what “clear” means?
Since when is Harris a Physician to diagnose President Trump as unstable. There are Laws stating only a Physician can diagnose . She has violated the HIPA low
The question, why are 50% of people following Trump, but the  Washington Post has counted over 30K +  lies he continues to  do? Are this people dumb or  like  most Cult followers, you don't ask questions you just follow. Unfortunately most Christian regions are doing the same thing. Are the following the word of God from  the Bible or are they following the practices of leaders in their church organizations ?  (Just do a little research in  the topical section of the Bible and let God reveal the true)
She cant even answer 1 question.  😂.   All she does is bash trump.  She has no class.  Lmfao
What actually ARE your policies?????
Kamala doesn’t know the answer and she tried to dodge the question.
Wow, seems as though her defense was to not stop talking so he couldn't even ask a question. Too bad he couldn't duct tape her mouth shut till he was done asking
She's terrible at conversations she doesn't amswer questions at all😂😂😂
Why can't she just answer the question?!!
Omg this woman can't answer a question to save her life.
How can someone talk so much yet not actually say anything?
Dodge dodge dodge. Answer the question asked
Wonder how she would feel if it was her own daughter killed by someone she was responsible for releasing
I truly don’t know what she stands for
I don't think she answered 1 question
I just wana know why she looks like a dude
I’m so glad I saw this interview before the election. She is not fit to run a country. She can barely answer a question. Oooof.
Why people saying she got no answers when she talkin about bills and ideas she trying to to push?
He does such a great job knowing she’s not gonna answer his questions.
When asked a question this stupid foolish vice president only talks about Donald Trump.
Great questions, if only he had given her the opportunity to talk and answer them.  I didn't find him professional. I was looking forward to this interview.
Then if you’re going to strengthen the economy, WHY didn’t you do that already, you’ve been in office 3.5 years already.
Answer the question !
If fentanyl is such a big issue why don’t they give morphine anymore? They are administering fentanyl to patients willingly.
No she wasnt she never once answered any question. None of them ever do. It should be a rule the question has to be answered or they are not qualified. Not this BS talking around the question.
Did she answer any question?
Yall see how she twitching and glitching??? What is she hiding 😂😂👴🏿🍿
Don't ask questions as a journalist if you only plan to interrupt and not allow them to complete their answer. This is a terrible interview. She wasn't allowed to fully speak.  Baiting questions at best and when she tried to answer, she was interrupted the moment they didn't like how the response was going.  I mean she had to even call them out on cherry picking videos and clips just to make them look bad and Trump better.  The bias definitely showed.....smh.
Is her pants on fire?
She can’t answer a question.  Talk about a filibuster!!!
Gotcha Question: How many illegal immigrants were let into the country under Biden?  Better question:  What is the measurement of illegal immigration? Is it people that illegally cross the southern border only, people that are here illegally in total, or  is there someone who monitors the overall process of illegal immigration that scores its status?
She cant even answer 1 fkin question critically. Brain damage would be ashamed to be identified with kamala and their voters
Kamala Harris never answers the  questions put to Her.😢
So when does she start to cry!!!!
She can never answer a question straight
@2:30 why does it seem that she never really answer a direct question, she dances around them.
Did we think she will end WAR?
Why does this guy keep interrupting her
what's been happening the last 4 years then to get Judges, support etc?
Why can’t she admit she dropped the ball? 🤦🏼‍♂️
I remember watching this more than a week ago. The unedited version. Fox asked questions, interrupting her constantly when she talked and tried to give an answer. Played an edited video that she pointed out and then rushed to finish because the guy was getting grilled from the earpiece too much to think so he had to bail.
Free tuition? While I'm $26,000 in the hole and many others have it worse 🤦🏾‍♂️. Please let's stop this nonsense
Just answer the dang question Kamala
Don't all of the hardcore MAGA people love how delusional G-PA Trump has tossed lil Vance under the bus, making sure he doesn't say anything else so stupid?
I like how she bounces around the questions and never gives a straight answer  😂 that's definitely somebody i want as my president 😂😭
Where has she been?
“Madame Vice President where do you stand on the most important issues facing the nation today?”  “Google it.”
Guys, you can only give a good answer to a question if the question is any good. All of the questions given to her were severely biased and no one is prepared to face such public attack.
Before you vote just ask yourself this one question do you want the Border open if you don't want the Border open then please vote for Trump but if you want the Border open for the rest of our lives wide open then vote for Kamala cuz she's made it perfectly clear that's what she plans on doing
She sounds like me answering questions on tests… 😭
Did you notice how this garbage changes voice depending on who she is lying to? Is this supposed to be her nasal white Karen voice? Seriously I haven’t seen her suck this bad since she was under Willie Brown 😂😂😂😂
Is it me, or did she not answer a single question?
If Joe Biden was doing such a GREAT JOB, why did he get pushed out and she was installed??   Kamalie is full of 💩
Where are the numbers?
Is it just me or does it look like she's listening from an ear piece.
This interviewer is a joke! What kind of host doesn't let his guests speak when he's asking the questions. Fire that obnoxious man.
How can we elect a person that won’t answer any question
“Do you support using taxpayer dollars to fund gender transition of prisoners?” “I will follow the law🤓☝️” -Kamala 2024
He tried so hard to get Kamala to respond to his genuine questions but she just refused to give clear answers.
Is only me or we only see Kamala supporters on her social medial only and no where else.
What is her "plan" aside from spending taxpayer money to subsidize people who cannot afford housing who will eventually default on their home loans because they cannot afford their housing? We have seen this before in the 80's.  Guess who profits? The corporations like Blackrock who come in and buy up all those properties for pennies on the dollar. The American taxpayer is the looser in all of this.
she still didn't answer the first question ???
How many coconuts do we think she lost when she fell off the tree?
Ask about inflation  Grocery prices  The inflation reduction act that was a waste of money  The housing market drastic increase  The multiple proxy wars we have direct involvement in and tons of money that goes right back into the military industrial complex investors pockets and is not kept track of in war torn corrupt countries  I mean this is a failed interview I mean better than most she actually got real questions unlike Joe who got what flavor ice cream do you like and the interviewer isn't bias af and actually shows respect but she dosent deserve the respect if this was a trump interview he'd cut her off every chance he got but tbh he probably wanted her to make a fool of herself.
A lot of people in the comments here crapping their pants about her not answering a question as if Trump has ever directly answered a question or made a coherent statement in his life 😂
Brian would never grill Trump like this. Fake news
Trump rumbles when answering questions so?
She’s so good at not answering the question
She lacks listening skills can’t even answer a simple question
Can't you be accountable? Stop blaming Pres. Trump for your failures. You actually look and sound ridiculous
Why is she shouting?
she is so hard to watch. talks forever while she tries to form an idea which is usually nothing to do with a question.
😂 what do you intend to do what you do is different stories
She never answers a question properly. 🤔🤔🤔🤔😒😒😒😒🙄🙄
Kamala we’ll talk about trump when we talk TO trump. This is about YOU. Can you please answer a question and not dance around the questions with trump rants. I assume not.
She never answers a question all she does is go round and round
Why can’t she answer a question? Why is this always a long story and no answer?  I’m over this b!+€h
Two things. One, he needs to stop interrupting, its rude as all get out. Two, every response she just blames trump and points the finger instead of answering the question.
Someone needs to ask where the money comes from to food, clothes and housing and medical for these migrants. Should not be my tax dollars.
What happened to US??? Is this a fkn joke? this is the presidential candidate???? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This lady literally refuses to answer any questions this is sad
I love this interview! She is narcissistic & gaslighting EVERY SINGLE policy! Not one single clear answer! These are direct questions and there hasn’t been a single clear answer yet😮
If immigration is such a priority problem. Why not make a single bill only for immigration instead of always adding extra junk to it knowing it wont pass.
She talks in circles,she Nevers really answers the question ⁉️
she cant even answer any question
She can't answer a direct question in any interview huge red flag😂
what is taking so long to fix it.
If she cant handel this ? How will she handel putin then ?😅
She can't even answer a question.  She is so full of booze pills and/or coke . She can't put a coherent sentence together.  Please America don't vote this s!@t in again. Sick of these people getting rich off our tax dollars . Liars!
How about Gaza? Isn’t tragic what Zionist doing there?
Why is it hard to answer the question straight.? Always round and round to nowhere.
Dude she has no words she is lost
Was a single question answered??
What's your f**king plan?????!!!!!!!!
Let me finish not answering your question! If you want let me continue rambling about nothing I will start getting mad.
Again it's  hard to tell what she stand for and what her plans are
Brett,you have done a great job in asking her questions!
She should know better. As an attorney, an often used objection is 'Objection. Non responsive to the question.' She never answered the question.
She is not a clear communicator... Not confident... How can she be a present?
why would they rush her off the show? O.o
Just answer the question..
Just Answer the Question!
She cannot even answer a question on topic. Yall democratic voters are supporting that? Everyone of you need help.
What a rude prick! I gave up on the 2nd question / 2nd interruption.
She’s absolute incompetent when faced with any inquisition..🤬
Finally a real journalist asked tough and not softball questions! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
So what’s the plan? Why can’t she say? Why dodge and deflect every question with no clear answer?
Did she almost say “hotel” instead of cartel?
3 mins in and I haven’t gotten an answer to the first question
Why doesnt she ever answear the fukin question
Kamala Harris is a joke. Does she really know what she is saying???
How can president  Joe Biden be a candidate and then turned over to Vice President Kamala Harris?
She can't even answer the question
She Dodge questions better the neo dodging Bullets.
How slowly is she talking to waste time.😂
Just answer the question for heaven’s sake…she is so manipulative
All she does , is talk about trump🤔 but cant answer one question?
Woman never answers the questions as usual!
How is it possible to speak so much and say absolutley nothing
Inflation reduction aid???
She just can’t answer a question or take responsibility for their actions!!
Vice President can't even answer a simple question. 🙄
What about the seniors who only make 900$ a month can’t afford to rent a house plus utilities
You are cackling away to avoid the sericious questions like an idiot as ding bell rings
Killing babies is not women's body she is killing.  You and your mother are the same body?  Do you bathe your body or her body   It's a very simple question. I am down to your level.  So please answer me  and to Americans
Kamala,  Kamala. Please answer the questions correctly each time.  Don't go off the trip to lala, the Cackling Land😮
Word salad from scamala, he’s asking very simple questions the require simple answers. Democrats are masters of deflection
How can ANYONE talk so much and say NOTHING?
Your making fun of Joe Biden the President after he chose you stupid?
Lady, you are in charge NOW!!!! She is a terrible liar because she can’t answer a question. Also, she is supposed to be a lawyer and her vocabulary is so limited.
Never answers the question,?????
She knocked it out the park. What learned is just repeat the question and then never actually answer the question.
Gets upset, yet can't answer  any of the question she's being asked.
She's so full of it never answers the question incredible
Is it just me or is she taking a page from Hilarys book on lying because make her white and add the hair boom 💥
She full of 💩💩💩. Can't answer ONE question straight up. 😂😂😂 this is nothing but a comedy show.
did she answer a single question?
Thank God the first time in 8 years anybody ask the Democrats hard questions and she still don't understand it's not a democracy baby it's a republic
What kind of apology was that to a grieving mother? Apologizing for how the mother feels instead of apologizing for what Kamala did to CAUSE her to feel this way! Take accountability!
Why is that Americans think that a political leader is automatically wrong just because they can't give a 3-word solution to a complex political issue?
She wants to fund taxpayer gender transition surgeries for prisoners??????????????   She will follow the law because she will make it the law.  She's demented.
When are we all going to stand up against this 'acting', she just says a whole load of nothing.. the same as our UK politicians
She just falls apart when someone asks her tough questions
Commentator shut your mouth and let her answer the question!!
Getting to the point would be answering the question directly!
Did Obama tell her to just keep saying “let me be clear” and then not say anything?
Were not talking last decade. Were asking about you and Biden last 4 years
Does she ever answer questions
I love how she changes the subject whenever he asks her a question she doesn't want to answer then plays victim whenever he asks her again lol 🤦‍♂️
Is she still not wearing those Bluetooth earrings!?!?
Why is no one in the comments deabting policies?
What have you actually achieved or completed successfully in your previous 4 years in office!
Why is he not asking her if she worked in mcdonalds?
She couldn’t answer one question
Marxist double - speak avoidance. That's the only way Communist Kamala can answer any question.
She isn't answering! She is avoiding answering the question, talking about what she likes ! Pushing the same phrase..."let me answer!" .She  wants to answer anything else but not answer what the question is about! I am so sad, for who can't see the avoidance of her real behavior and incapacity to be true.
So many words were babbled, yet none of his questions were answered.
Asking her if she owes their family an apology is appalling…
Why does he keep interupting her after asking her a question? Granted, she seems to go on and on and on before actually answering questions, but still.. he interviews like a man arguing in a doomed relationship.
So Sad that she can't answer any question clearly, sure supporting here there where is the money for all this plans comming from? Let me guess more taxes out of my paycheck
The way she speaks is exhausting—she stretches out her words and uses ones that don’t even seem to fit, just to fill time. It’s unbearable to listen to, almost physically painful. Am I the only one who feels this way, or do others agree?
Wait…. She does know she was Vice President and Joe Biden was President the last 4 years right??  All this crap is on her and her administration.
Whose mouthpiece was this? hmmm let me guess!!
Typical liberal, never answers the question.
She can't even answer a question carbon copy of most American women stubborn. She's all over the place  You don't know what the American ppl want. You ppl vote for her because shes a woman that's all lol
Why are there so many bots here ?? Trump supporters ??
Where is the $ going to come from for the $25k down payment to 1st time home buyers? I hope it’s not going to come from higher federal and state taxes and a cut to current homeowners deductions.  In other words, I hear great ideas at the 50k level, but no clear details…
Do other countries with social healthcare approve and pay for gender reassignment surgery?  I hope to high Heaven this is not passed in the US!  My tax dollars shouldn’t cover this! Otherwise one can argue why fed taxes shouldn’t cover any elective surgery!
Why does B can’t answer a simple question
Scamala dontCarris looks so mad she’s getting asked real questions she has no answers to lmfaooooo
Where are all of the Kamala Harris supporters in these comments to stand up for her?? I hear crickets 😂😂
Did not answer ONE question. She had an opportunity to change unafilliated minds. Pathetic.
She can NOT answer a single question
answer the question
how many people
your not answering the question
Priority? Why do nothing at the first place?you been setting in your office for almost four long years and now you're talking priority?? Vote trump.
Why are people bashing Brent he asked normal questions they weren’t hard questions like the press is saying trump gets asked similar questions and no one says anything
Can you interview corrupt military of Pakistan like this, please?
As someone from Australia, how can you not vote Trump over Harris... She just deflects and has 0 sense of accountability, hurhur blame Trump for everything.
It’s so weird how everything that has gone wrong in last 4 years even admittedly gone wrong by dems is somehow trumps fault ,also a question, if the border agents are instructed not to do their job how does having more agents help the situation
Never have i ever heard someone dance around answering 1 question.  Never a straight answer
Wow Fox act like CNN and other fake news. Media people do not turn interview into debate even you don't get the answer to your question, let the people hear and decide.
Mallamutt is great at deflecting the question.
Can I get a bunch of restraining orders from being harrassed
The Democratic Party is preparing for another fraudulent election,but can it be stopped?
This is how politicians answer questions. They skirt the issue instead of answering a question. God help us if this Bimbo gets into Office.
I wish he pressed that question about bidens mental state. I wonder if there was an agreement that he could press her answers
48 seconds into the video, she can't even answer the 1st question 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is what happens when she doesn't have the questions in advance. Like she wouldn't have if she were opposite Xi or Putin or Kim.
Where was your fresh and new ideas over the last 4 years????
Why is she so defensive? It must be because she has been caught red-handed, lol
Who can handle listening to her? Oh lort
The interviewer basically tried to overtalk her so she couldn’t answer the full question.
9 months ago?  Thought she said that was the first thing they did, this woman can’t remember her lies.
So how come its got so much worst under your watch.
Why is nobody asking about the national debt?
He asks questions and mostly wont let her answer 5je question. It makes me nervouse to know that Trumps past administration Republicans dont endorse him and claim that he is dangerouse.
Right out of the gate she avoids just ANSWERING THE QUESTION…and is combative immediately…terrible leadership qualities!  Trump/Vance 2024 🇺🇸🙏🏻
Answer the question stop blaming trump
Wait .. she has a PLAN?? My sales territory plan is more robust!!
A pathetic preview of could be our leadership.   She is absolutely without a doubt useless and clueless, she does not know how to answer a direct question.
Never answered one question
She just refuses to answer a question straight up..... refuses to. Sorry but wayyyyy to much lying and side stepping....
Gone are the days where questions are answered in interviews
She never answered the question!!
Hahaha shes stupidly funny 🤣 when she tries to answer a question about 79% of Americans think U.S is on the wrong track with a laugh and replies come on man ahahaha 🤣
And she just continues to dodge questions lol what a puppet
101 class on how to evade questions
So why is she supporting Ukraine?
Is it just me or does she try way to hard to imitate Obama?
She's not answering the question!! She never says HOW SHE'S GONNA DO ANYTHING
Every time she is asked does she support something, she uses a bunch of gaslighted words
Wow, stark difference in questions between a Trump and Harris interview on Fox.  They should ask Trump these questions  instead of being little fanboys.
Does she have in these earbud, earrings from germany, is this a real thing, someone look into this
How do you spend 30 minutes answering like 5 questions?
Righties having an intelligent thought challenge (impossible)
She is so slimy, just answer the question!
She never clearly answers the intervewers queston
She is our biggest downfall. She has yet to answer a question. lwas democrat but not any more. She's  a joke
Just seeing how emotional she is answering question never taking accountability that’s why women can’t lead u keep trump name in your mouth that a emotional response
Gets slammed with a question, doesn’t answer and attacks trump.  Couldn’t answer one question.  4 more years of the worst economy?
so what's the number of people answer the 1st question
She is certainly avoiding the direct answers to the questions.
All she does is deflect!
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION. Stop blaming others.
im confused, she mumbled about the border bill that trump didn't like but been doing what the last four years to try to pass it? she is in office and could start making good on her promises already. this would be the only way she could get elected
Why is she never answering the questions?  4 years, in office and still no actions.
She talks in circles Harris can't answer direct questions
He is confused.
Answer the questions.  Sheesh
Dalton's supermayor mark 2?
She never answered his question  professionally. Plus, does she have a speech coach?  She could be a judge somewhere at the corner but to run USA?? She doesn’t even know how to enunciate English. She just doesn’t own what she is saying. Just platitudes in slow pace.
Who ordered a word salad?
If and when the dems win again will they shut up about Trump? So exhausting to hear his name every 10 seconds
This reporter is so rude.. you asked the question then give her a chance to answer. He keeps interrupting her..  We have to give her credit to go and take this interview
Yo what’s the interviewers name yall?
And this one running for president? Wow can’t even answer one question
She just can't answer the question.
Did she not catch the question about her judgment? When did you recognize biden off his game...
"So, are they misguided or stupid?"  Kamala "Oh God, I would never say thay about the American people." Voice raised... you did though...
3 minutes in 2/2 questions not answered... and still rambling. He asked for a number, a guess even, and a yes or a no....
Didn't that SAME border bill given billions of tax money to Ukraine and Israel?
This is equivalent to a parent asking a child why they haven’t cleaned there room and blaming it on trump why it hasn’t been done .
The thing about that bill I don’t understand, is how does Donald trump have more power to pass/cancel a bill than the active sitting president
She's being pushed to answer the questions and thats very uncomfortable for her
nice video are you open to new ideas
This lady is a joke , just answer the questions
How does anyone with a brain vote for this woman????
I wish he asked what's a woman!???
Great question finally
Nice job with the questions this lady is a joke! TRUMP ALL THE WAY!
I really like how she doesn’t allow him to finish his question then keeps talking over him and says “I’m trying to answer the question” meanwhile not answering the actual question
She always tip toes around every question and will never give a straight up answer and cares what people think. I’m gonna vote for someone that can answer a question and dosent tiptoe around it .
Turn tbe  page?   On  W H A T ?   WHAT ?       What  dos  that  mean ?
The queen of gaslighting every question she is asked. She never answers. He has so much free rent in her head it’s sick
Kamala is just spinning around the question never answering.
Bro are u dumb or somethin
Bro you are just not a good interviewer
Why would anyone even consider voting for a presidial candidate (Trump) who clearly suffers from severe narcissistic personality disorder and is delusional, unstable, has psychopathic tendencies and is a pathological liar?
The problem is that she doesn't answer the question. Whatever she does she does answers, she answers slowly, and on details on purpose to waste time. Of course, she is not sorry about all her stupid tragedies.  Well, closed the borders,  IDIOTS !
She starts to answer the question by giving twenty stories omg
She never ever answers a single question 😤
Saying “I’m sorry for her loss” is not an apology. Furthermore, YOU caused this! President Trump was ACTUALLY fixing the problem, and you and Biden reversed Trump’s policies.
Who exactly is stopping her from being clear? Other than herself that is
Okay so being honest if you were forced to take a shot everytime the word Donald and/or Trump is said, how far are you making it?
So, MAGAs don't think inflation was due to covid and insane spending? So, I guess Trump's record of worst job losses wasn't because of covid either?
Pure evil she doges questions because she knows it’s bad to answer them pure evil.
Finially she got some real questions.   Bret did good chasing her around the circle riund the question and shift off into nonsence word salud and blame shifting
How can you ask someone a question and then not let them answer?
What is wrong with this mans face????
With all the intelligent accomplished women in the world why would the democrats run her?
She's not used to having hard questions from a real journalist, unlike CNN or MSNBC who give her staged questions.... at 22:48 you can see her motion to her staff to stop the interview
This lady is just not ready for prime time. She’s a disaster answering tough questions and can’t handle pressure.
Fox gave her the questions too.
Should have asked her to take her earrings off.
I think they both looked foolish him for asking questions then interupting and her for beatimg around the bush with answers .
Make her answer the question.
Is there a spiritual problem haunting this election ?
Great interview. Ask a question but don’t let her answer   Solid work Fox
She’s grilled
Notice how she's dodging his questions? 🤔 Interesting.
Does America really want to see this woman for 4 years?
She can’t answer any question 😂
So then fixing the border is opening the borders? Hmm
Is she reading a teleprompter?! 😂
how can a person speak so many words and say NOTHING
Answer the question
How many crimes have been committed by Americans?
I asked AI if Trump is a psychopath?  A psychopath, lacks a conscience, empathy, and remorse. Famous psychopaths include serial killers like Ted Bundy and fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter.   While opinions vary, some experts have described Donald Trump as exhibiting traits associated with psychopathy:  Malignant Narcissism:  Trump displays pathological lying, obsession with violence, and manipulability when praised.  He appears indifferent to others’ suffering and holds anti-social values.  Trump’s destructive behavior and false narratives influenced his supporters, leading to shared delusions and extreme actions.  The followers, often dealing with societal stress or developmental wounds, yearn for a parental figure and become needy.  Psychopathy Traits:  A test ranked Trump’s psychopathy traits higher than Hitler’s and just below Idi Amin and Henry VIII.
Where have those plans been for the last 4 years?
That's not an apology
Did she call him, "Ben?"
Finally a “journalist” that has the stones to ask the real substantive questions we tax payers are asking! So, will you continue with this new line of accountability questioning Bret or cower to the powers that make your electronic deposits?
She was great at answering her own questions
And how did Iran get the nuclear arms that they now possess? The USA gave them the nuclear arms.
I thought it was just trump, but it’s starting to look like all republicans have no speaking etiquette.  Like stop why are we talking over someone answering your question. This is so unprofessional 😭
And how does Kamala explain 20k Haitians in Springiield, OH?
Where is the money going to come from for all her fantastical policies???
Bro grilled her so hard that she couldn’t even respond 😭
Repeatedly talking over someone trying to answer a question is sh*t show. I think the interviewer tried to make a case of crash and burn but failed miserably in his execution. This is an interview; it's not a debate
Your kids could have a day with Trump or Harris, which one would you choose? I know which one I think would give them fun!
“I will follow the law “ isn’t an answer
She can't answer a question if her life depended upon it. She also does NOT possess the ability to be truthful
Eighty pages of policy??? She knows most people won’t read all that.
He should have ask to inspect her ear rings
She can not answer a single question!!
This interviewer asks her a question, then answers for her. I wish he would shut up and let me listen to her answers.
She is very clear REALLY and ask us how clear we all think she is!!!!!!!!
She loves to throw words to buy time and create confusion without even attempting to answer the question. She must have done a course to be such an expert at this.
Doesn't answer one question just keeps dancing around the answer. How cam any think she is presidential material?
Good lord! Does she even know how to answer one single question? Most of his questions only required a yes or no answer; not a deflective filibuster.
Looks like she got slapped with questions she couldn’t answer again. She really looked like a clown on this one.
She is dumb as a box of rocks!! Never answers a freaking question!!
She refuses to directly answer any question.  Pathetic!
she can't answer even own question  trump 2024
You reversed Trump's policies as soon as you got into office, was that a mistake?  We put forward a bill and Trump stopped it.  They put forward a bill 3 years after they reversed all Trump's policies and allowed over 6 million illegal immigrants in.
Mrs Vice President, why are you letting so many Haitian immigrants into our swing states? To change the vote in your favor? You are changing hard working American lives for the worse, in these areas.
More resources and she needs a mental evaluation and a colloquy.
I wonder if in 2040 American TV personalities will still look like they are from the 80's wallstreet era 😂
21:13 "When did you first notice Joe Biden's mental facilities had been diminshed?" Kamala: Deer in headlights, followed by dishonest word salad and Trump, Trump, Trump.
Why is he cutting her off and being rude, let the lady talk
Grilled?  How about finally pinned down without the cover of the liberal media?
I see she is wearing her Bluetooth earrings again. She can not answer a question without someone telling her what to say. She is brainless.
Interviewer didn't even let her answer the question. I would never vote for her but jesus christ mainstream media sucks.
This woman has a lot of nonsense to say but none is answering the question to the point.
She sounds like she is listening to something whenbit was ask about Iran😮
is she ok like that? i wanna ask to her supporters.donald looks dangerous but also honest. and harris looks salad.
Are we supposed to guess what her policies are? She dodges everything.
What's this guy's problem? Why does he keep cutting her off.
Just starting the interview and she cannot even answer the first freaking question. I love that Bratt It's not letting her get off so easily, and keep asking her about it, like  cutting her off when she's saying Something else besides answering the freaking question.
She never answers a question just all fluff, smoke & mirrors
Please stop asking me about my failures!
Answer da foking question
If you can't answer a direct question within the first 30 seconds, then you don't have an answer.  You have excuses.
Did Brett's producers: A) make an honest mistake, or B) purposefully used the wrong clip to antagonize Harris, or C) purposefully sabotage his interview?
did a single coherent word come out of her mouth?
Did not answer a single question clearly.  The body languages just screaming that she is not even comfortable to talk about anything  especially the truth.
She always dances around the question, and she will never take responsibility 😢
Im 13 minutes in and she hasn't answer a single question all she is doing is deflecting question after question and nlaming everyong literally everything she was asvocated flr and blaming trump!!
Is it technically a “real interview” if the person conducting it talks more than the person he’s interviewing, constantly interrupts, speaks over them, and doesn’t let them finish a sentence throughout the whole procedure?
Can she answer a question with using trumps name?😂😂😂😂
Grilled??? 😂😂😂 he don’t let her talk,,, wish to see Trumpy on CNN but he has no balls
Couldn’t answer a question if she had to. 100% pathetic. 100% one of the dumbest people on the planet
These questions are inefficient, yes they may be issues but it’s the pov and context you give it that make it seem greater than it actually is. Waste of time.
How do you plan on paying for 1500 more boarder patrol agents.
"do you owe that family an apology" shakes head no "I'm so sorry"
Let her answer the questions.
Answer the God  blessed question. ! She can’t do it !
Talk about personal experiences 😂😂😂😂😂ask Willie 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do you mean the rhetoric that the democrats started spewing when Trump ran for president in 2016? That is what started the divide in the country in the first place!
Why is faux news still being called a "news" station? Didn't you admit in court what liars you are?
Why doesn’t he let her talk tho??
She really can’t keep trump out of her mouth, just answer a friggin question lady
What BULL$HIT!!!!!  She went out of her way to NOT answer a question. She played the “… let me finish…” again  saying.
She never really answers the questions
Take responsibility for what happened in your administration? Does;nt look like anytime soon she will be taking responsibilities for there policies.
If she is going to make the rich pay more, then why are rich people backing her. That doesn't add up.
How long would her nose be if she’s Pinocchio   Holy cow I wouldn’t trust her to house sit for me
I AM WONDERING! If ENGLISH IS HER FIRST LANGUAGE???   Because SHEs NOT GETTING EVEN ONE QUESTION RIGHT ! Lol  TRUMP 2024 🎉
So what are your plans Kamala?
What a politician... Every time Brett tried asking a hard-hitting question she tried to ramble on and not allow him to ask it.
Why would you ask questions if you won’t let her answer? 😂
why is Donald Trump from the past interviewing Kamala Harris?
look how dictators answer questions. absolutely identical tricks. beware of Kamala
Why reverse the executive orders?
Cant give a straight answer to a single question.
She can’t seem to answer a question at all without blaming trump.  She’s so rehearsed it’s pathetic!  What a puppet
She completely incapable of answering a question.
EXCELLENT QUESTIONS POSED TO KAMALA. THE INTERVIEWER WAS ON HIS GAME AND PROFESSIONAL🎉
is he allergic to letting the person he's interviewing speak?
Who was it that call 19-24 yr olds stupid??
How can Americans take this candidate seriously? 2:19
Who came after SNL?
Great question : what are you turning the page from, and you have been in the office for the last 3  1/2 years.  Wow, and he just established that she will not change anything biden done.  MIC  DROPPED 🫳
Why did she agree to go on Fox News???
Hey Bret, how many times did Trump ask u to blend over and on your knees?
Why did kamala wait till election time Trump had it fixed and Biden Harris undid everything Trump did on the border
Typical of many men, this one asks a question then talks over the woman. This is where the US is headed.
Thats a person who is asking a questions you want us to vote for you ??? God in heaven 🙏 help is is she is elected all she has doing is babbling
This woman can't answer a question. What a joke.
Typical Fox. Ask questions that insinuate one thing and cut off your respondent before they get a chance to respond.  She has not answered a single question uninterrupted. Did you notice that? Biased little #%*#.  American does not need a convict for president. Fox wouldn’t know the meaning of ‘fact’ so it’s just wasted on them. Time to turn over a NEW page.
Why interview someone if you won't let them speak
She never answered anything you asked she talks in circles everyone knows it was all their fault
Listen to this Kamala talk her word salad and not answer the question
What is wrong with this guys face?
Id like to ask her one question..... what did the five fingers say to the face!! 🖐
What a whiny evil betch. All she can do is talk about DJ just to avoid answering a question that she doesn’t have a proper answer for.
He asked her questions and then over and over talked over her while she answered.
Her speech just  like a circle game , never answered the questions.
Man democrats dropped the ball installing her. I get that she’s technically an incumbent but when the country is unhappy why would they ever choose an incumbent VP over a new dem? Either way I’m glad they did 😂
How are Trumptards this stupid? If their darling baby donald was asked these questions, they would be calling it fake news!  Pathetic.
KAMALA DOESN'T HAVE ANY PROJECT TO PUT INTO PRACTICE, SHE HAS DIFFICULTIES ANSWERING SIMPLE QUESTIONS.
Who is this insufferable little child of a woman?!
She was so awful! Just answer the darn questions!
So, the plan is not to prevent crime, but to have faster condemnation? Did I get that right?
Every question just gets some talk around it’s mind blowing
She looks nervous answering real questions
Where’s the word salad??? 😉🙃🙂🤪🫢🫢🫢🫢😮 How about those peal earring’s…
Political views aside, Brett kept asking questions then interrupting her when she tried to answer. The man sure likes to hear himself talk.
She cant answer a question to save her life
@22:00 the same national security that said hunters laptop was Russian miss information? Those people just keep thinking we are blind def and stupid.
Why is he not letting her speak? 😄 Really insecure interviewer
Ndeee, she needs to learn how to actually answer the questions asked
What is your plan?
Never answered a question 🤦🏽‍♂️ she seems like a horrible person
so if i get a question and my answer is explaining that question again, that counts as an answer? it’s easy to be US president
Who's here after SNL?
Can she keep her hands to herself for two seconds???? 🤮
All democratics will not answer the question .....alllllll of them are full of hate and evil.......Watch Ted cruz roast judge democrats
Short question and giving long filibustering responses is evading responsibility
She couldn't answer straight to his question! She talked around and not focuss...
How does she pay for that.  Print more money.
A new way forward?  Marxist much?
Brett: asks question   Kamala:  “I will follow the law”  Brett:  so you aren’t going to answer the question, then?  Kamala:  “I will follow the law”   What a joke lol
Bro like, why is she MAD doing this interview?
Not even one question answered.
talk about how to avoid the question. Shes like that obsessed ex that just cant move on. Every topic is about them. You could announce that she just won the lotto and she wouldnt even hear you.
That was far more competent question dodging than I was expecting out of her.
Kamala can't answer a question straight. It's like the opposite of Trump. Democrats in 2024  just dance around the issue and the question lmao.
Didn't She have that guy locked up for being a "threat" to Planned Parenthood? Seizing all the evidence of black market sales of aborted fetuses??? Hmmm 🤔
She never answered 1 single question!
How did this idiot even get this far
I'm 5 minutes in and am ready to use a word I don't use... C... She wants to FINISH her answers, but none of them are answers to THE QUESTIONS 🤦🏼
Why is this edited, removing Bret Baier's deliberate use of wrong clips? Bret Baier is a piece of $hit. 💩
If Israel is allowed to defend itself, why does she keep condemning Israel's "treatment of Palestinians"?
How you know she only watches MSNBC's clips and not his actual speeches...
Were there any photos or preferably videos of Kamala taken within the 30 minutes after the interview? Several times she looked like she was fixing to cry.
He asked her all the questions and she had none of the answers.
Yeah, but you're not stopping it, are you?
Kamala never answer  any question
If the word "Trump" is banned, she may not know how to answer questions.
Does she not realize he has  been the president before? How dangerous was life then compared to now? Why was that question not asked??
How do you answer a question with an answer is not at all related to the question that is originally presented.
Did Trump win the election in 2020 and Trump has been our president for the last 4 years or did Biden/Harris win and they have been the official declared president and vice president?
Did they find out Who those Liberals are that are Infiltrating as  Republicans????   Why is Nobody worried about this???  Their sneaking in the front door to bring our party down from the Inside!!!!
13:41  turn the page? She's the current page right now I think we definitely need to turn the page
Again, always dodging and avoiding actually answer the question. Why even bother to interviewing her. Clearly she is desperate at this stage… hopeless
Ask the citizens of California if she did a good job!  The woman is incompetent and delusional.
Why is she screaming?
Answering simple questions is very difficult for this woman. She blames Trump for everything she did bad and expects you to vote for her because she's a prosecutor raised in a middle class.
13:19 Who is we? Is there more than one president?
Bret made that scum answer questions vs playing dodge ball
Does anyone believe this Dunce?!
Why?????? Do you want , prisoner's  to have" transgender, surigies , with Tax payers money! We the people said Hell no!!
This women needs to join a dodge ball team. Her ability to dodge literally every question is incredible!
Could anybody answer the question for me why is the United States is so loyalty to Israel when they're not loyal to the American  people where they risking all I lives and money to help the synagogue of Satan 🙏
Does any truth ever come out of her mouth?
Why are her interviews so hard to watch?
🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞 Oh my..prolonged killing time responses.  FOX NEWS HOST question unanswered.  🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞
Blah blah blah she can not answer a question!!! She is an idiot. And that’s o bummer in her ear.
😂😂 how you ask a question and go str8 to another question or answer your question
Can't Dems figure out she will never answer a question.   And has no idea about anything
She walks around every question with zero answer.
Does anyone know how to tell if a democrat is lying?? Their lips are moving
She will never answer a straight question i so agree with that mother
He don't give her time to answer the question WoW
Why can’t she talk about her policies though? She is cringe
What exactly is "broken" with our immigration system? Specifically...? Will never get an answer. Eff emotions, quit breaking the law. We don't owe anybody anything.
Who else here fell out of a coconut tree? 🖐️
she grilled herself
I mean I'm not a party person or a fox fan but he's asking what I wanted to know answers to.
Not sure where the Real Black Men, are. So many white men are coming forward to defend Kamala. Maybe they are ok  with ancestors once being slaves
How many lies can she spin on!
If it's not a continuation, then why did she copy and paste all his policies from his website to hers
Why did she cook, though?
Who ordered the chopped Kamala?!
Ok, what are the options?
She doesn't want to answer about Joes cognition
Answer the questions!!!
OMG,  just ANSWER a question for ONCE without blaming TRUMP for ALL YOUR DAMAGES!!!
I hate interviews like this. Ask the question, the shut up. 😑
What did we learn..... Nothing???
Did she just fall out of the coconut tree 😂
She has not answered one question
How come Trump is hiding and won't do interviews with anybody, and won't debate again? He knows she'll wipe the floor with him Again. He wouldn't show up to an NRA interview, he wouldn't show up for the 60 Minutes interview, won't debate again, that's weak. She's fierce and strong and has my vote, I don't vote for cowards and weak little men.
I cant watch this stupidity. Is she really having a degree?.
Is this a democracy? When did it change? Thought we were a republic? Shes like arguing with someone whos on drugs
Is Bret trying the oranatang look. I  am looking at the white circles around his eyes.
Is this a comedy skit? Total upside-down world. Hilarious!
Crazy how she keeps dodging every single question, as if she can’t give a single good answer. I wonder why’s that?
WHAT DO ISRAEL AND IRAN WAR HAVE TO DO WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE???
Most of us were raised in a middle class family. So what’s her f$&king point?
Come on Brett she doesn't know anything about that's to hard of a question for her Brett 😅😅😅😅
Why did Trump spent 40 minutes on the last town hall dacing to music? He's he unfit?
Do you regret letting the immigrants into the country at the beginning of your administration? She couldn't answer that question.
How many immigrants have you and your administration let into the country? She couldn't answer that question
I love these questions Bret is asking!
DID ANYONE COUNT HOW MANY TIMES SHE DAID THE NAME "TRUMP"..?SHE is SCARED amd petrified.... Sounds to me she was ENDORSING TRUMP RATHER THAN VILAFYING HIM...THANK U COMMIE LA...KEEP UP SAYING TRUMP SO MORE PEOPLE VOTE FOR HIM
From every question asked: 10 irrelevant excuses!!
For those of us that don't regularly watch Fox News, are all interviews just the host talking over the guest?
she hasn’t answered one question yet.
Did she even answer one complete question.
Why can't she answer any questions?
How long after being named "border czar" did it take to visit the border
Waiting for one question to be answered, just one.
who is this guy no respect lol
She never answers ANY hard question.......
Wait, but your beating down Mr.Trump every chance you get and pointing fingers
So what are YOU going to do!??! Stop pointing fingers! So what is YOUR solution. Please tell us!
That woman just cant admit to ANYTHING... Did she forget about the 90 executive orders that she and Biden thought were a good idea????
As much as I want to watch this to see how she handles questions and current economic affairs I lost brain cells listening to garbage and wannabe stoic.
I loved it! He put to her questions she's never had to answer before. And it showed her stupidity!!
If you ask a question, you should let the person answer. Not constantly cut them off and browbeat them. A true JOURNALIST knows this. A performer does not. Brett is obviously trying to please his “boss” and save his job.
She cant even answer simple questions she just comes up with word salad and strays far away from any answer
She has no pride she got one question rite
Does she secretly love Donald? She wouldn't stop talking about him. Wow.
She can’t even answered a simple question
There’s a new dance move: swaying around questions and dodging answers = it’s called the “Harris Waltz”
loved the part where he let her talk and answer his questions without interrupting her 😻
She never answers the question... Always thr 18:01 ows it back to Trump! Again how can you you believe HER! Listen!!
Before Asian Hate?
I’m confused why she still tries to be president?? She’s had to be threatened to become the next puppet.
9 mins and 30 seconds in is where she begins dodging everything. and answering a question with something completely unrelated, let's see how this continues.
This was a train wreck. She avoided answering almost every question and pivoted to talking points. I wish she would have just given direct answers
"When did you first notice Bidens Mental Capacity diminished" Lol 😅 Perfect Question
Is she a robot !?
Answering simple questions requires a functioning brain...
Answer the f question omg she is so annoying
Do we really want to have government dictating who this country is?
Is anybody else just sick and tired of candidates that spend their ENTIRE election and BILLIONS of dollars just tearing one another down instead of focusing their actual attention on the country where it is SUPPOSED TO BE?!!!
Why doesn’t he let her finish a sentence? He can fact check all he wants after she completes a thought. Terrible interviewer ..
Why so defensive hmmm 🤔
Kamala Harris, Jerry Lundegaard.   Any difference?
If I bet in Vegas that she would say "unburdened", but she actually said "burdened", do I still get paid???
Oooooooooooh this is so bad. Lady, go away. Seriously. Just answer the question.
The fear in her eyes after he asks a clear question. . . Right before the little voice from her earrings tells her what to say; "it's Trump's fault!"
Answer a question for once in your life!!! 🙄
The experiment? Cloning? And left him brain dead partially? Oh my
Is the real problem being able to afford a house or is the problem taxes and insurance. 46% of my check goes to insurance and taxes. That’s almost half  it’s sad to work and automatically have to give up half for what??? Taxes you never get and insurance you never use
Raise your hand if you know someone smarter than Kamala. This woman cannot even answer one question.
Bret is a skilled journalist and Kamala is skilled at evading questions.
She never answers a direct question with a direct answer.   Always skirting around the truth distracting you with another speech blaming Trump.  🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Did she even answer a single question?
Allergic to answering a question
First question and she's lying through her teeth 3:20
I’ve heard someone talk so much and still not answer the question 😂😂
Why did Bret Baier even let her talk? He should have kept interrupting, so she couldn’t complete even a sentence… sad
Penalties on illegal crossings… So are they gonna use their free debit card money to pay those penalties? What money are they paying this with?
She can never answer questions...........
Just want to ask “is there any loyalty in anyone anymore”? Stands to reason the admin wld be different, but to say “it will not be a continuation of the Joe Biden admin”, even though nothing negative was SPOKEN-the tone threw him underneath the bus
Why can't see just answer a question???
Would you buy a used car from this woman?
This was not an interview. This was an interrogation but she handled herself very well. I don't think people realize that she's a former prosecutor, district attorney, and Attorney general. She knows how to handle stuff like this
He should have asked why Biden isn't on the ballot.
He's asking the right questions but I can't get over his face
y does he interrupt her EVERY TIME the starts to fumble?!?!?    donkey
Those families are still experiencing if they are alive
All of that bimbo babble is sickening!!! He asked for numbers and specifics!!! We don't need new resources, government needs to  allow the agents to do THEIR jobs!!!!
How did he manage to keep a straight face?
...btw, her right ear? Every video, her left side is in view, maybe..............she has an earpiece...?
She really did not answer the questions, she danced around each question.
How can things be someone’s fault who isn’t in office?
Finally some real questions 🙌🏼
How tf is Harris winning the elections. Ah here go
Can you really believe or Trust someone who confuses Reproduction vs. Termination?
I'm still waiting for her to answer any of the questions posed to her.
Here's what I don't get, she's politician, politicians are often known as prolific liars, how on Earth is she so bad at this!? Like that aside, she clearly is trying the pivot to Trump tactic, but she is so transparent that surely nobody can take her seriously?
Tell me, are you gonna bring your woke feelings to the world Summit meeting because if you do, they’re gonna rip you apart they don’t have time for people who are woke over there
Anyone noticed her wearing the same ear rings ever since becoming the Democrat presidential candidate ?  She used to wear many different types... now it's those ones that look alot like the wifi earpiece ear rings !!!
Lots of deflecting and not answering the questions as they were asked…..
I will not judge the questions or answers given here. But I do see one person being quite disrespectful and sometimes rude, whilst the other stays calm and tries to overcome the many interruptions. This is just not the way how you handle such a dialogue.
❗️❗️Wait... is she wearing the same earrings that she wore on the debate with Donald Trump, that has in ear monitor??
I’m not even voting for her but man, you could respectfully allow her to answer YOUR questions..   Isn’t this interview techniques 101?
Dodged every question and didn’t take responsibility for anything! Pathetic!
So how u controling drugs money n guns crossing the border if u dont have control u dont know whos coming whos going n what they moving u make me sick
You would think if she was a real human being she would treat Donald Trump with respect specially after all the stuff that he just went through recently, she would treat him like a human being instead of treating him like garbage 24 seven and then putting a fake smile on her face when she sees him
ok right Kamala really?  the question is simple. why have you not CLOSED the border period , until suitable resouces and screening can be put into place..
Did not answer the question vote Trump
Kamala could use Word Salad for hours, but it still does not make sense or even answer a direct question! 😅TRUMP 2024!!👍
This season on how not to answer the questions...
There is something wrong with the guy's face.  yall noticed?
Anyone elses comments being censored by corrupt google?
Is there a more stupid woman on this planet? Tough question. Naturally, the answer is to blame Trump. 😂😂
She was an AG?😮
Trump baby!   What even is this? Is this a satire interview?
If he’s unfit why wasn’t he removed as Biden was removed?
"Let me finish" - Please... if you take 1 minute and 30 seconds to speak, you're not answering the question. A confident person that has done nothing wrong does not need that much time to answer a simple question.
Why is he so rude?
She had (and has) power for three years and counting. Why couldn't she make changes? That question is her nemesis.
Anybody knows where I can find a video where Bret Baier is apologizing for showing her the wrong clip? It does not appear on their channel and it is also absent from the description - there does not appear any reference to the correction anywhere so I cannot prove it to somehow who questions that it actually happened. Thanks.
Soo what is her solution  to the problem?
How much money does her campaign spend on her many ads I have to see all of the time?!
I don’t think I’ve ever seen her actually answer a question
Question: they endorsed Trump and said you're a failure at border security  Kamala: They're frustrated. I get it. They work hard  Um? 😂 that's not an answer. Yes. Yes they are working very very hard.
How can anyone listen to her and still vote for her?
She cannot answer one question. She is horrible at interviewing when tough questions are asked.
It’s all politics gibberish, so what are we supposed to do with any of this, bc I just found out there’s a couple more candidates that I didn’t know about, so now I’m confused
Charlamagne's interview questions for Harris were less biased.
Did Kamala forget that we are a REPUBLIC, not a Democracy?
What's Joe doing?
Why does it seem like she is pausing between every few words as if she's being fed the words??????????? HMMMMMM?
Who is paying for the 25,000.00  down payment Harris wants to give all these people?
9:45 - how Kamala gets away with lying by telling the truth is she just doesn’t pronounce the necessary word. If you watch the answer to her question right here at 9:45 - she’s doesn’t wish to decriminalize “bord” crossings.
You’re not answering the questions!!!! So frustrating.
This is exactly how Justin Trudeau deflects every legitimate question.
Never answer the questions
Where is Trump’s interview now?
Halfway through and she hasn't answered one question.
This man will not let her fully respond to a single question lol
Bro why he interrupting her on every question let her speak lmao
Well, on the bright side. When she loses the election she can teach classes on how to side step questions.
He was like asking questions to the Chinese Communist government speaker. Like a tape recorder.😂
Why does trump and the left hate each other so much
this guy needs to let her answer the questions
Why does she always raise her voice pitch when talking? Is she trying to seem more sincere? She is such a fake. I can't believe anyone actually wants to vote for her.
The interviewer should ask questions, not to debate the guest.
What does she know about taking responsibility for anything that happens in her administration
She's still trying to not try to answer the question to this day.
I don’t think she actually answered one question
She doesn't answer a thing
Where are we gonna get the money for all this stuff, Kamala???  We are at an all-time high, $35 Trillion in debt ($7 trillion more this past year... on what???).  The Dems are just terrible.
Do you think your sorry will bring back her daughter
Does she hear herself when she talks??
She couldn't ANSWER EVEN 1... EVEN ONE QUESTION ⁉️ What the heck!!?
What we have here is a butcher turning heart    docter?????
The question is an iSland and she just swims around it, without touching land.  She canNOT answer a single question.
This lady is dumb she avoids questions. I couldn’t vote for her. If she was the only person running she hasn’t given an answer to a single question that had any truth, I think we need to rename the Democrat party to the Dumb-as-crap party.
What about Deportation?! That’s what I did not hear either of them talk about.
From question 1. She has no idea how much BS comes out of her mouth. Idk she understands anything. She’s worst than Biden.
They had an inflation reduction act??????  Could have fooled me
Never a specific answer.😡
He is very rude and kept interrupting her. Let her finish, then question what she said if you have further questions.
Omg… tell us your standpoint, Shamala! You’ll follow the law… that doesn’t tell us what we can expect from you!!! Laws get broken all THE TIME, especially under the current administration that you are a part of!! Gtf outta here! 🤡
Did she call Brett Ben when answering the immigration question? 🤦‍♀️
Why she hasnt done all of the great things she would do yet??
okay… so what are your fresh and new ideas without mentioning donald trump and giving handouts?
is this comedy? or serious
Do u think regular American people have time to read your 87 pages policies? You just do have policies or you have no idea
Are you here talk about Trump to American people or your policy?
She never answer a question with YES or NO!
What is wrong with this woman
Did they tell her that this is her interview not trumps?
😂ANSWER THE QUESTION!!!! SHE IS SO IGNORANT!!!!!! I feel bad for people that support this girl😢 TRUMP 2024❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have one question to ask.  Does Washington represent you and your concerns?
Her first real interview
Ms harris what is 2+2? Her: buu bu bu but d ddd Donald trump bad!
She never answer the questions😂😂😂
Incapable of answering a question.  This woman cannot be president.  We would be doomed
She won’t answer a question. What a shame she’s just like the rest of them they’re all evil.
Has anyone actually checked into how many cases she prosecuted? She has a failed record and failed policies.  She has taken no responsibility for any of her administration
I don't think is basically what she says. Says boarder was in crisis when Trump was in. Trump was blocked by Democrats .Face it they want cheap labor for corporate America importing voters giving drivers licenses for what .They don't have jobs or money to buy them or pay for insurance
The question was “how many”’ which she NEVER ANSWERED. BLAH BLAH BLAH
Why does she keep blaming Trump when he's not been president for the last four years
Road runner harris can’t even answer a question 😂😂😂🤦🏽🤦🏽
Q What politician never answers a question that is ask   A Kamala Harris  A Felix the cat  A borris Karloff A Hildegard  A gargamel from the smurfs A courageous cat and minute mouse
What’s your plan then??
This little girl can’t answer one question
It's amazing how she can take any and every question and give nothing but non-answers and circle talk.
She won't even answer the question. She needs to go back to doing the dishes and fold the laundry. Kamala you suck!!!!!!
Why does he ask questions and then not let her respond? Did he learn his interview skills at Trump U?
Wow... that's a lot of words... so it must mean _something_ important, right? Quick question, are politicians allowed to give 1-word answers to direct questions, or is that prohibited by the rules of the "Who Wants To Be A President" gameshow? This season's been good, but next season... da-bomb...literally...
can you answer a question without mentioning trump? Lets be clear, I was raised in a middle class family and its all trump's fault.
Does anyone get tired of the fake accent she puts on when talking about immigration?
Turn the page? O want a flip book full of 8 years of Kamala.
It could'nt be they killed the bill because it included 16 billion in aid to Ukraine....oh no Trump killed it.
Do you know what I'm talking about, cause I don't 😂
She never finished and never actually answered the question.  That is her style.
Where’s the evidence of Trump saying don’t pass this Bill for election purposes ? With everything going on with impeachments, court cases etc. I don’t think Trump would have been thinking that far ahead even if he wanted to do that. The republican party wanted something better and Democrats wouldn’t do it.
Ten minutes in and she hasn’t answered a single question wow
Does anyone watch this and still plan to vote for Kamala Harris?
Kamala can’t answer straight questions because she has a brain of a bird and can’t decide which direction to fly
Can she ever actually answer a question
Why is her hair not moving on the right side of her head? Please, guarantee she has a mic In her ear..
lol what does think that we’re stupid?
Politicians never answer a direct question!
She cannot answer a single question. She’s trying to filibuster 🙄
Joe Biden has the jugdement and the experiment.
IMAGINE THESE SAME QUESTIONS ASKED TO DONALD TRUMP
Interesting how she goes around the question & never answers it. Yet of course some claims she answered everyone yeah right.
How much did Brett pay for all of his plastic surgery?
Can she give a clear answer to any question? The whole interview she said practically nothing...
Is Harris a communist?
Wow she is so fake, she didn’t answer a single question she was asked so what’s the point of going to an interview?
Why is she so whiny? That raised high pitch tone of voice does not inspire confidence.
How does it feel to get a taste of her own medicine?!? She couldnt stand being fact checked and called out in her ridiculous BS. And a "moderator"/interviewer who isnt on her side! How does it feel Kamala??
Why on earth support transgender?
Does she only own 1 pair of earrings? She literally always has it on like an earpiece or like a part of a superhero outfit.
She never answered a dam question. Wow
What the hell is she always doing with her hands. Acting like Obama.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? My mother raised me middle class and so now I'm entitled to everything cause Donald Trump
Who can believe thos  corporations????
Why isn't she answering the questions?? Even one question wasn't answered.
The number of leading questions he poses with the intent to make her look bad is crazy not to mention the amount of times he talks over her is incredibly rude. My guy if you're sorry that you're talking over each other then stop talking
What a liar she evades the answer but she never makes a point
Just answer the dam question !!!!!
Did she even answer a single question in those 26 minutes?
Actually what are you talking about?😂
This by far the most dangerous woman, anywhere in the world! She NEVER answers ANY question and she looks you in the eye and lies to your face! She is very, very dangerous!
Any former democrats/independents voting for Trump this year ?
She deflected every question as expected
Where is trump hiding
What was n what could have been,circle back, now I'm black, now I'm not, word salads are 95%off right now
She cant even answer a question
How anyone can vote for someone who willy refuses to answer what they actually intend to do as president is beyond mind blowing?
Lied didn't answer a question.filabusted..
Can you imagine Trump giving up presidency when his decline kicks in?   He is a toxic old man who has poisoned our country
She needs to stop dodging his questions
Why do you ask her a question and interrupt her ? She's not finished talking for god's sake. When you don't like her answer, you interrupt her.  This is why I hate Fox News ! You suck ! I'm here to support her.  I'm even more convinced how fake Fox News is.. She is so brave for coming here to talk with you and to bring reason and truth but you keep interrupting her. I'm turning the page now because Fox News suck ! Bye
Is she unable to answer yes or no questions?
You have to give her some credit at how well she avoids every single question. That is not easy to do.
Why do we need a new bill to solve the border issue?  What bill was in effect when Trump was in charge of the border?
OK, but what’s wrong with his face? Shifty eyes and Botox? Eew.
so.... I watched whole video..... What is her plan?
every question she brings up trump.
How disrespectful is the fact that she is not even allowed to answer questions without being interrupted.
Crossed arms. Crosses legs. She is uncomfortable and most importantly not confident. They didn't bother to coach her on body language? This is a FOX interview that was 20 mins. She is going to perform better against actual adversaries?? Unbelievable but then again Biden is still sitting in office.
What is wrong mentality of this woman she's not well?
She cannot answer a question
She's just plain ole sad! Can't even answer a simple question and always talking around the question. Smdh
Both sides ask such radical questions
Would you buy from a carmaker who only bad mouths the competitor's models but offers no information at all on his own cars, not even a mock up, let alone the mechanics and specifications?
This lady doesnt answer 1 question. Zero accountability. So whos voting for her and please tell why???
Why can’t  she ever answered a simple question and have to blame it on her opponent??
All politicians do the same. They don’t answer the question straightforward. They know the exact answer, but they also know they can’t answer that way.
She can't answer any question. She just defers to DT each time.
So, when Mike Pence was vice president did he have more power than trump? 🤔 I swear these trumpsters are so ignorant, foolish and immature
Bout time she got grilled
He's obviously a brainwashed trump supporter and it shows. How you ask questions acting like you already have the answer.
The burden from the last decade?? You were part of the worst part!!!
Boy he just couldn’t stop talking over her. Could it be because she made total sense and he didn’t want that to show through? So glad she was composed and kept going, ignoring his rude interruptions.
DID SHE EVER ANSWER THE QUESTION??????????? 4 YEARS SHE DIDNT CARE NOW SHE DOES 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
ask 10 questions, get 0 answers from her
The burden from the last decade?? You were part of the worst part!!!
You knowdoes she realize the buyers won’t get the 25k but the seller will which will increase housing?
She can’t even answer a simple question!
There were so many deer in the headlights moments.
How does she not understand the 2 year difference between when she deleted policies and then asked for loaded Bills?
She's not serious about the affair of the people, but rather beautiful words saying nothing. Where is her teleprompter?
Why does she go into robot mode when asked about iran?? As if she is repeating verbatim what is being told to her in her ear piece😮😮😂
Has anyone seen this woman answer a question directly? Like even once? All she does is talk about Trump. Lady if you want anyone's vote... you gotta actually answer a single critical question...
Second question he does not allow her to respond before injecting his opinions. She has asked him twice to let her finish
Brett was terrified to let her answer.  He kept talking over her.  If you don't want to hear the answer, don't ask the question
Ah, it’s about a book … about an island? …with treasure on it?
The first question he would not let her answer. He had an agenda from the outset.
Is the timestamp between 21:10 - 21:30 called a Freudian slip?????????????? Who saw the movie Manturian candidate?
If you were interviewing someone for a job, ANY job,  and they answered questions by not even saying anything to do with the original question would you hire them? And she’s going for President, think about that…
She can’t answer one question!!  She’s pathetic
"experiment", that is a freudian slip. Voting Trump.
So what u have done in the past 3 years?  Let's just talk about the man before me
Where oh where did they find this in competant
QUESTION! What did you not like during Trump 1st presidency. What did you like about the last 3 years?
Oh God let her finish let her finish let her be finished..... Done over goodbye please go away forever.... She never answers the question... She sits there and waits for Obama to speak through her earpiece
She never answers the question
If according to the current vice president trump has had more control of the government than her then why would we make her president over him? I mean if he can do more as a defendant than she can as vp that's embarrassing for her.
So why not get tuffer at the board Democrats?????
She is an idiot. Answer the question that is asked Dramala! 3:45
If she can’t answer a simple question? How can she run a country? the answer is no way she is fit to be the president
It was like watching a Thomas the Tank Engine train wreck in very slow motion. Painful to watch. Answer the bloody questions.
The point is you are not owning up to what you have done, you change every question to what you want not what America wants to hear because you play around with every question.
why did they end the interview so swiftly?
If hes not stable.. what does that make of Joe and Kamala then!!!?
She deflects and doesn't ever answer the question - how the hell is she VP of anything??  Her whole campaign is based on not what she did or is doing, but what trump did... weak and embarrassing  representative of our beautiful country.  👎🏻
How’s she going to pay for $25K for new home buyers?? She’s going to start charging Donald Trump rent for all the space he takes up in her head! 😂
Ten years?   If you win the presidency, will you deport all those millions of illegal immigrants?
How does she know how much was spent on that ad, but has no understanding of white house affairs?
She never answers ANY QUESTION PERIOD!
What’s the point of town halls and interviews if you aren’t going to directly answer a question🙄
Is she wearing the same earrings she wore in her debate with President Trump?  It look like the same ones but idk.
honest? she never is. just lies. blame always goes to Trump. all his fault. She is evil.
This isnt an interview it feels like a  talk show🤔  that was rushed .  ...
How can anyone vote for her? Who are these people?
Kamala: Slow-paced question deflection + Trump blame-game word salad + continuous speaking over interviewer in slow mo circles without ever being "clear" and pointing fingers at Trump...  26 mins later...   Solicitation to go to her website to read her policies for yourself.🤣👎🏼
It was at that very first question she wished she didn’t show up at all 😂😂😂😂😂embarrassing
My god she is mind numbing to listen to! Waste of space just lies and wasted air taking about nothing that has to do with the question others see her the way i do....right!?
Are the last three and a half years excluded from the last decade?
Why did the dems agree to this interview? Makes no sense
This guy needs a bonus trump gets these questions every interview it is a nice change
How is this election about focusing on the needs of the American people when she's focused on letting immigrants in and paying Ukraine or giving prison inmates transition surgery????
How is this election about focusing on the needs of the American people when she's focused on letting immigrants in and paying Ukraine or giving prison inmates transition surgery????
Kamala is a train wreck. And never answers a question and diverts every time. Sad.
This was cringing ..the way these questions was directed was wild..
anyone else notice she's wearing the same earrings as she did during the debate with trump there earphone earrings lol
Can she not do an interview or debate without the earpiece???
If she gets the presidency is she still going to blame trump for everything???? 😂😂😂😂
She still hasn’t answered a question . It’s infuriating
can anyone just point me to a question that she actually answers?
Dose she ever answer any questions with real answers?
I’m confused. How is it DT fault if there was a bill in place and they reversed it when they got in office
22:45 this is a shaking VP unsure of herself
why does she always wear the same earrings for interviews and debates but never seen in pubic? oh yeah those same earrings are sold on amazon as a ear piece to hear info.
That is not the question then he asked for it and of course he needs to interrupting you because you’re not giving him the right answer
As usual telling grandma stories and will NEVER answer a question properly. Good job this reporter did what other reporters are too chicken shet to do 😡
There she goes again she can't answer the question so make fun of Trump!  She is CRAZY!
Have you ever heard Donald Trump support tax funded transgender operations???  I have NOT.  But Kamala thinks Trump supports tax payer funded Transgender operations.  What a total qwak.  Vote Trump.
How in the world did he get her to do this interview?
She did a good job, kept her coolness and composed, where is the “grill” coming from
VP Harris very clearly answers all of these questions in simple English… not sure what other listeners aren’t hearing, maybe it’s an attention span issue
Great Job Bret…she can’t never seem to answer any question.
Wow this lady did not answer ONE question about herself in a direct manner. WHAT A SNAKE
Ask her about the Truancy Act she signed in California that got plenty mothers arrested that were taking care their sick ill kids that had sickle cell disease and other illnesses cause they miss so many days of school.
If her word salads end up failing her, you think she'll go back to mouth hugging?
She wont outright answer a single question,shes a liar!
You ask someone a question then start talking when they answer. Make it make sense!
She can't even answer a direct question. She talks more than she answers the question
She won't answer a question
Brett,  thank you for pressing these questions unlike the rest of the media!!!
I feel like she’s like a run on sentence! Just keep rambling about nothing asked! Answer the question.
Mr. Baier, asking a question and speaking over the response makes you unlikeable. Your interview skills with madam VP are ham-handed for serious journalism
So if the problem was that a bill wasn't passed during your admin, how will your admin continuing magically fix the problem?
Where did her accent go 😂
Israel has been safe and secure for decades so why are we still pretending america has any influence on what Israel does?
Prison inmates get free transitioning surgery? 😂
Hey, Kamala, do you own any other earrings?🤔
She really knows how to answer a simple question in only 10 minutes without actually answering
Not one single actual answer.
21:25 and the experiment?
WHY must America ALWAYS support Israel?  Why must America not ALWAYS support Turkey or Egypt or Botswana?  What's so special about Israel that American senators must blindly swear undying allegiance to a foreign nation?
You are a joke. Can’t even answer a question. You answer a question with the question.
This was more like a debate than an interview
an why hasn't she done anything while she's been in office!!! Now where are the solutions she likes to talk about.
[Uh, is this a presidential candidate or a middle school student council candidate?]
B:  Do you still support transgender operations for illegal immigrant prison inmates?
Classless act by the interviewer.
Why is he asking a question and not allowing a answer to be complete
He’s just cutting her off left and right… ask a question and allow a response.
Not a fan of fox, but she isn't answering the question. Which 99% of politicians never do.
Word salad’s with no direct answer to a point blank question is nothing more than a diversion.
She can not answer one question!!!! Wow
she is horrible with answering any question 😂. watching this is frustrating
She can't even answer a question
18:24 is that the ceiling bird?!
Answer the question stop the word salad
I’m not sure if she answered more than a quarter of one question
Why did my father pay thousands for his wife to come to this country if it’s always been broken before Biden/Harris got in office
She avoids answering questions so well!
Trump 2024. Answer the questions
Jesus… political games? You can’t answer an easy yes or no question! You, Mrs. Harris are absolutely pathetic! (And NOT because you’re a female) because you’re a pathetic human being.
Is she wearing the same earrings from the debate ?
Do you like pickles??? Donald trump hates pickles
Why hasn’t anyone spoken on the Biden/harris jab mandate?? 🤔 odd
Why does she always dodge the questions
Didn't Trump have to answer in court for January 6th an insurrection. She should have to answer in a criminal court of law about the coup that her and her party orchestrated against Joe Biden.
Peaceful protests?  Like the takeover in Washington state?  Was that peaceful?
Anybody else curious or hoping they will ask why relief funds for Americans in crisis in North Carolina are basically depleted people got $750 so I'm assuming relief funds must have been somewhere around $860 million Orso and then immediately turn around and give billions to Ukraine this Administration is the definition of America last.
Why does she keep bringing up the last decade when Trump only served 4 years?
She cant answer questions directly 😑
Why is she always going back to lies about what Trump said and not what she will do?
so.. are you going to let her talk or are you going to keep forcing your garbage takes onto her rife with desperate attempts at clawing a reaction out of her?  Fox really has gone downhill, jesus..
Not good at answering the questions.
Harris has went after human traffickers but won’t release the Epstein list?
Wasn't he big on building a wall and he was being ridiculed for not letting immigrants in?
She never answered one question
she can’t answer a question directly bruh
Is it just me or is he holding his laughter?
Pathetic, folds under pressure. She finally got hard questions
What a loser. Typical Republican they ask a question and won’t let you answer.
Is he going to let her talk? Sounds like he wants her to Interview him.
She can’t answer a question directly to save her life!   Blames Trump for her not being able to give an explanation of her own actions.  .  Can’t step up.   Weak.  Zero leadership.   Zero.
This freak acts just like trump, asking then over talking the person.  He looks like he’s had bad plastic surgery and Hollywood white teeth that look fake af
Can someone please give me a count of how many of the questions she actually answered instead of changing the subject and going on and on?
Is that a man or a woman
Same earrings as the debate.  Who is telling her what to say?
She sounds like she wants it to cry with all this hard questions!!! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Why would this guy ask a question and then proceed to not shut the f*ck up?
I really wish the interviewer, regardless  whom it may be, would not move to on until she answered the question.
If trump wins, then the election integrity is sound. If trump loses, then it is corrupt? Win or lose, a true American accepts the people's choice.
Of course she won't answer that question... They are Pure Evil...
Sooo how many people did they bring in ? 🤦‍♀️
Is it just me or does she seem to be “projecting” (unconsciously taking unwanted emotions or traits you don't like about yourself and attributing them to someone else)?
Donald this Donald that, was Donald running the show for the past 4 years or am I missing something?????
I hate when this make a question, and then trying to give a aswer and don't let them talk, come on fox News please don't acting like the other news channels, let them talk
She couldn’t even give a direct answer to his question on illegal immigration.
Maddam Vice President,  what is your favorite drink?  DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A FAVORITE DRINK.
This guy doesn’t know how to ask a question and LISTEN. Small 🍆.
Why didn't he shut up and let her finish her sentences????!!!!!!!!
I have a feeling that she thought this was going to be a I hate trump campaign..all i see is this poor guy ask her a question and she spends it around about trump and how bad he is an not answering the question
Please somebody help me, I'm lost. He asked me a simple question and I don't know what to say
Now left wants to get him for asking real questions
What a professional Dodger! She cannot answer a question without talking about Trump!
Why is he giving them tax cuts? To keep manufacturing in the USA, I’m tired of people calling me and I can’t understand them cause they hiring others across seas ughh I dislike her she lies and cheats and is dishonest and talks to us as if we slow when she is the one slow
If the President should be able to handle criticizm without threatening to lock people up, why has she threatened and called for people to be locked up that make memes of her?
The mental gymnastics employed in this echo chamber is remarkable. Not one question was asked in good faith. All of them were leading questions, and seeing the trap in place she maneuvered toward context. You could see him panicking and triggering his traps against unplanned responses.
Vice President Harris did a phenomenal job answering every question.
How many time did she mentioned Trump name??! Can someone tell me?!😂😂
Blah blah blah, just answer the question, she probably doesn’t know the answer, to the questions asked or can’t answer it truthfully
This is how she would be President, questions will not be answered except by a long and winding monologue that has nothing to do with the actual question asked.
Why did Bret Baier not debunk Kamala when she said trump had broken borders also?
Stop KAMPALA please last 3 years lady that was the question. Not talking about Trump decade ago😂
What do you eat for breakfast?   Well Trump hates breakfast
Can she answer one question?
Anyone notice how her eyes are "dead" ?
why in the world does this man continuously interrupt her while she's speaking? you can't...ask a question and refuse to allow her to answer?
A lot of bots here that have 10-12 years since they started account, is the deep state manipulating data to fit their narrative?
Just answer the dogone question. She's wasting time. Stallingvtactic.
If Trump isn’t for the American people, why is it that he actually did something about the Hurricane in NC? He raised money and donated to the people who have lost their homes
Answer the question..  Trump, Trump, Trump oh yah TRUMP.
Never trust a person that can't give a straight forward answer to a straight forward question ask to them. (Kamala Harris)
Bret: “Let me ask you a question, what is your favourite flavour?” Kamala: “Well I wo-“ Bret: “Ok but are you a vegetarian or not” Kamala: “can I answer your fir-“ Bret: “what’s your favourite type of sauce”
What t he reporter should do is ask her a question, respond with “shut the faq up” as soon as she starts speaking and move onto the next question.
What can be what has been unburdened by what has been?
She's the #1 candidate if you only take into account the ability spew nonsense around a question that was asked and never answer the question.
Why did she just look left off camera like she was taking cues?
It wasn't broke so what were you trying to fix
She answers the question worse than a  4yo
My 5 year old daughter can be clearer when asked
Imagine her at a table with Kim Jung Il, Bashir Al Assad, Putin?
I'm sorry but Bret if you're going to ask a question can you at least give a chance to answer? I actually want to hear these answers
Why are politicians the worst kind of people
why is she yelling? why didn't bret no hold her feet to the fire? he was way too easy on her.......loser
Fascinating to hear the question and not hear the answer to that question.
Watching people whose candidate turned a town hall into the most cringe dance/dj session in recorded history think this was a bad interview makes me really question if we're doing enough to replace our lead water pipes 😬
Not one single laugh under real questions
Is it me or does this interviewer look like he could be in the muppet show?
This woman is not even prepared to be a building manager, imagine a nation with global power?😂 She couldn't answer a question.
The interviewer is weak: why was he chosen to conduct this interview?
For those that are wondering how many illegal immigrants are in this country it's probably around 10 million because there was 330 million people before Biden came in the office and then after he was in office and opened the border there was 340 million people in the country
She just can't give a clear answer to any of the questions that were asked.😅
Man she was trained on that question and still couldn’t answer
So wasn't covid a thing thin and wasn't the boarder important to keep covid from spreading
She doesn't answer his questions
Why didn’t Bret ask her about their rhetoric toward him and if they took any responsibility for the two attempted assassination attempts?
Finally questions we actually want to know
She never answers a question but just blows her horn and talks in circles.
6 Democrats voted against the border bill... Are you going to fail to mention EVERY SINGLE Republican voted NO except for 1. The dishonesty & misinformation is baffling.
This is refreshing for someone actually answering the questions despite being cut off and talked over versus  someone who talks in circles and at the end still doesn’t answer the questions
Doesn't she come from a middle class family? I can't remember
Question on newly issued transgender prison laws: “I will follow the law”  You’re about to be the law!
Why would dems push her for president????
Why is Joe Biden on trial?
Why would you invite a guest on & then not allow them to speak?
She's absolute trash and can't even answer simple questions without deflecting
Stop blaming Trump for your mistakes! Can she answer 1 Question without mentioning President Trump?🙄
Why did I need to manually find this on the fox page and it didn't shown up when I searched "fox kamala harris interview"?????
Answer the question…..
From New Zealand. Who is this dude? Do American blokes get Botox or something like that.
I’m convinced she doesn’t hear questions
How can she talk so much but say so little, and not ever actually answer the question being asked 🤦🏼‍♂️
Was she at the DNC???
The only "grilling" going on here is him not letting her answer any of the questions. So professional!
8:45 is she about to cry?
She thinks that discrediting trump will make her look better!😂how stupid can she be?🤪 No matter what she looks bad because everyone can hear she never answer questions !  The question which really knock her down is : » when did you notice first time the decline of president Joe Biden ? » to which she did not answer !
Does she ever answer a question without lying?
Nobody on earth dodges a question like she does
How's the wall that Trump promised us through Mexican payments?  Shouldn't the wall have sealed off illegal entrance?
Why does she keep bringing up Donald Trump?
what the f*7-k is your plan?
Official Dodger of Important Questions should be the only position she holds.  I’m sure they can whip up a position for that.
And still not a single answer
What number "word salad" was that on the menu?
Im confused....wasn't the border handled and closed when she took over????? Didn't she open it????
She cannot even answer a question what kind of Fruitloop is she?
Kamala has no plan! Keep running from her questions, what kind of leader is this?
When did you notice a change in Bidens capabilities? Well, I would say that he's always been capable because I saw him brush his teeth once.
Is she wearing those pearl earrings again?  I can't listen to her.  She makes me sick to my stomach.  It's been all a plan.
Why  she can  not answer a question!
Ask her about the people that are suffering from the hurricanes and tornadoes. Shes done zero. Tomorrow it might be you. Perhaps just think about that!!
We have a broken system....lady you do know you are the VP during this broken system right? So who is at fault for such broken system!!?? HMMMMM......🤔  🤣😂🤣😂
I find it very disturbing when someone refuses to answer a yes or no question with a yes or no answer. It’s unsettling, diabolical and crazy work
So if she cant answer a simple question in an interview what happens when there are tough questions to answer as the President...its like she just cant think for herself and answer with an intelligent answer, or just simple truth.
1. Why is she ridiculed for being middle class and an experienced prosecutor? Those are good things last time I checked. How is it bad/funny?
Does nobody have an issue with her constantly being cut off? This clearly had an agenda and all I see are comments making jokes. She is handling this with class and you people don’t have an issue with her dealing with a hostile interview?
Isn’t she the one who wanted the rhetoric to stop?  Hypocrite!
what about the middle class who have been working their asses off
So we just going to ignore FOX News used the wrong clip and Bret just ignores her? Hmmmmmmm
So what would you do differently again? 😂
Why is the obsession that she has with DT? I mean I get is her opponent, but she is in current Administration and she is part of the past too, all this years as VP... DT can't run the office if she is in it so why is he to blame that's just childish... very disappointed.
Would you say that fox supports Trump ? Honestly asking.
Why are people still supporting him?  Because they have been lied to and they believe him. They have fallen into his grip of cultism. Those people are delusional.
IDK who got grilled 😂😂😂 GO KAMALA!!! ❤❤❤
She can’t even answer a question without spinning it all around. Soon as she gets a question she doesn’t like she brings trump into it. This is ridiculous
She couldnt answer a single question.
Where’s her accent?
What kind of interviewer doesn't let the person being interviewed to speak and to answer the question he asked?
Pretty sure you didn’t answer one question he asked directly , you start babbling , you ask to finish answering questions but you never say,” yes or no” do you regret your choices allowing immigrants that committed crimes while here under their administration
Donald Trump *Answers asked questions* Kamala Harris *Avoids questions by talking bad about Trumps "character" and how she isn't Joe Biden*
You and I know what I am talking about?? I actually don't, what are you talking about? Hahaha  That is what happens when you talk to yourself!!! Hahaha
Is this the best of what Americans must choose from? I feel sorry for them.
Fact check please. . . How about answer the question alaready
She literally answered nothing
Just can’t answer a simple question. 🤦🏼‍♀️
21:58 answer the question
Why does she keep talking about Trump! Focus on talking about you and your policies! TDS big time!!
Imagine inviting someone to only throw questions at them, and not let them answer 😂 🤦🏽‍♀️ he was not mentally prepared to hear FACTS not “weaving” 3yr old language
Seriously, is there any one who still supports Kamal?
I'm still waiting for her to answer the first question lol
She didn't answer a single question. Pretty annoyed with the amount of deflecting she did.
She loves to drown out the clock ⏰  doesnt she ?
my god, he was only asking questions to set her up to "own" her, how lame she was also talking in circles to avoid
Is she still going to go on Joe Rogan after this?  That is going to be hilarious!
Why does Comrade "Stepford" Kommula and her commie controllers hate all the other commies in the world??? I.E.-Russia, North Korea, Venezula, etc....?????
These questions are asinine. Also typical for this idiot man to interrupt this highly qualified woman every 5 seconds when he sees her leading towards an answer he doesn’t like.
Why is it a topic of discussion? It's a topic for Taking ACTION. There's nothing to talk about - there is a problem that can only be solved by taking action. Words can't solve issues.  TALK IS CHEAP.
Is Trump also at fault for your lack of answers and having no plan?
PRIORITY???? THEN WHY HASN'T JOE CLOSED THE BORDER? HE OPENED IT, HE CAN CLOSE IT! Then congress etc.  can figure out the details. Though I'll be surprised if they do.
Geesh, ask a question & allow interviewee to actually answer said question seems pretty basic.  BTW, former courtroom clerk - it’s rare we’d have a defendant with an ICE hold (immigration). Most of those in arraignment court were natural born citizens, aka Americans.
She just continues to tap dance around every question.. she is not qualified for this job
Why is Trump still refusing interviews?
How’s its voice so annoying?
She disregarded every single question
Since when is a psychopath an authority on psychopathology?
This is such unprofessional interviewing. How are you going to ask a question and the interrupt every time she tries to answer?
Is she saying that dems have not used rhetoric that is divisive? That is gaslighting
What exactly is the supposed MEDICAL NECESSITY for anyone to go through gender reassignment?  I'm serious.  What possibly could necessitate from a valid medical point for anyone to switch gender?
Why does a supposed billionaire keep asking us for money? And hawking trash made in China?
Q: Do you support more or less benefits for illegal immigrants?
Q: How would you prioritze spending of tax revenue?
Q: Shall I get you coffee or tea?
She is Ridiculous.  She is not stable. She cant even talk without being coached by those earrings no response and CLEARLY AVOIDS answeingthe question as to if she knew about Bidens mental wellness
she didn't answer a single question without blaming trump, that's weakness.
Is she trying to read a teleprompter?
How is she supposed to answer a question without getting interrupted 🙄
When I get interviewed I answer questions directly.  Why doesn’t this woman do this?
She didn’t answer the Biden Question. Is he The real Biden or a fake? 🫢
How does it feel having your a×× handed to you by a girl 😂😂😂 @Brett
BLM a peaceful protest??  40 people died from the riots. Millions and millions of property damage?  We have suffered so much by the current administration.
Taking notes on how to avoid answering direct questions. This was awful to listen to.
Why did her management allow for this interview? 😂😂😂😂
Kamala Harris won't answer question you're just beating a dead horse Chauvet the question circle around the question and will not answer a single question
I would love to know why we are using tax payer dollars to keep people with marijuana charges in jail. Why are we using taxpayer dollars to throw homeless people back in prison, because our system won't take care of them when they get out of prison. Therefore, it is a vicious cycle, and we keep our prisons full
So you are going to ignore them showing her edited clip to trick her up?
No ANSWER on how many immagrants! 🙄 then she blames Trump even tho Biden and Harris signed off to remove Trumps wall.
She only has one set of earrings?
He and this channel are biased and obviously Trump supporters. His questions are one sided. He kept trying to "man handle" her and his questions are one sided, and attacks instead of it being opened ended and unbiased.
Great job, sir. You did your best; she just will not answer a straight question.
She can’t answer a singular question
She can't answer a singel question
Finally someone who stopped letting her do her little scripts and drilled her on questions she STILL didn't answer.  She literally is just repeating campaign slogans and not answering any of his questions.
As I learn more and more about body language, she lies out her teeth, especially when asked about whether those family are owed an apology. Look at how she shakes her head no while answering. Just wow.
How, just how? We are living in a simulation.
We need to shut to border down,not hire mire judges and more agents,and spend how much more money,unnecessarily??!
How can anyone speak with that much botox? 😂
why is imagrations so important to these left wing.
Every interview she talks about Donald Trump, just answer the questions.
I’ve never seen more migrants in line to get a CDL.  Lets face it, is the DMV really doing their due diligence in verifying those documents?  If your answer is no, you think those “frustrated” BP folks are doing their of job also?
Asked one question and Kamala goes on 5 page essay on the question that explains nothing
Would we really like this woman with her hand on the nuclear codes?
I can't stand how our officials refuse to simply answer questions.
She is given a question that requires a yes or no, and answers with her tossed word salads. What a joke!
Answer the question!!
Is this video isnt the full length one i suppose
How can anyone vote for this crackpot? 19 days till Election Day and she’s still deflecting questions.
Someone should do a video showing VP Harris answering questions and Donal Trump answering questions side by side.
Why is she still using language that almost had Trump taking out
I don't think I have Ever seen an interviewer interrupt the person they are asking questions of this much in my life.  The guy is annoying.
She can t give a straight answer on any question.
90 seconds in and Brett already cut her off before she could answer the first question and then moved on to the next. Great journalism you ogre faced inbred.
If you ask her questions, you should give her an opportunity to answer, not talk over her after 2 seconds.  Don't be rude.
What’s the point of an interview if you don’t let her talk?
why does she use the hand signal that is basically her making a wall with her hand blocking her from everyone and we see her fakeness and inability to do the job!
Compare this Trump on Univision and tell me who did worse.
Why does she keep promising change on Day 1 when she's been in office for 1,367 days?
Kamala Harris please teach me how to answer questions without answering 🤣
Ooey its getting hot. Is she sweating I don't know if she gonna be able to handle the heat. Just wondering, is somebody gonna save her? Those democratic Puppet masters probably going to pull her out. I wouldn't be surprised
Are you sorry for letting those illegal immigrants go that killed someone’s daughter? I have experience in transnational criminal organizations👍
SMH Words escape me. Lord Have mercy on us all. Why is it so difficult to answer a simple question with a simple answer
Denial is never a good strategy, ask Clinton.
Why is he talking over Her?
Brett, please question Trump in the same way. Hold Trump to account in the same way.
Well versed in skirting a question
Why the avoidance yoh, every answer was a non answer
Is it just me or are you able to skip Trump Ads on YouTube but are forced to watch Kamala ones?  For some reason I can’t skip the Kamala ones and I want to lol.
I don’t understand she had over 3 years to fix things and all she does is blame trump?
Is it just me or did she not answer a single question??
KAMALA - answer the question….when did you notice Biden’s mental state had changed?!? She continually lies to the American people
Really? How you do when you in White House or you only puppy for democrats party tell you what to do 😀😃😄
Way to dance around every question asked. Answer the actual question. Jeez.
is it just me or was this full interview challenging to find?  Either the SEO keywords were bad, or they're intentionally trying to hide it.
He “grilled” her because he wouldn’t let her speak.
Oh my God can I keep jabbering away and deflecting from the question without being interrupted buy me re-ask the question that I'm avoiding?
What if brett could SHUT THE F@&# UP and let the woman speak!?! He spent the entire time talking over or putting words in her mouth.  Really demonstrated confidence like an alpha schmuck.
Christ! I hate "reporters" that ask a question and then proceed to interrupt the interviewee before they can finish their thought!!! Ask your question AND SHUT UP.
She never answers any questions. All she does is drag on the question and make it sound in a slow pace since she ain’t got any clue and people still vote for her. Horrible!
She’s a ghetto mess ask her about Willie brown?
Do you know who spilled the milk on floor? Trump four years ago😅
Why is the top of her head cgi'd?
Baier:  Why'd you remove the remain in Mexico policy for illegal migrants?
Why does she start talking with a southern drawl?? It’s fuckn’ embarrassing to watch!
Answer the fn questions stopped talking!
How is answering a question about americas biggest adversary, saying trump called someone a "loser", grounded in fact? She answered absolutely nothing.
The interviewer clearly cant keep his mouth shut when the person he is interviewing is trying to answer a question. Even I could do a better job. They were so scared of her talking.. If she was dumb as rocks, let her go on and dig her own grave like you do with Trump, but she is too smart for the average fox viewer.
Oh the same staff Trump fired for various reasons?  It was a legit termination. They’re mad because they were fired so yes unfortunately they will get even.
Do you regret the decision? 🎉 Who made that decision, really?
Man i had to speed up the video play speed to get past all the word salads so i didnt forget the question by the time she gets around to either a "half answer" or an obvious "I wont answer but here is who you can blame for that" kind of answer.
WHAT IS A ‘SCORGE’?
Never answered a single question🧐
She can't answer a question. It's all Trump's fault and she doesn't take responsibility for anything.
Does he really think he's a journalist?
Kamala 😂 cannot answer a question…not one.  How can she be President?  She only comes back with how awful she thinks Trump is.  The word salad tactic is just to waste time and get through the interview without answering any questions.  How dishonest and deceitful!  😅😅😂😂
it's unbelievable that election is 20 days away and she finally gets asked real questions vs bought out media
Wasting time to answer less questions
Gettin mad, dancing around questions pathetic
Is he going to let her speak?
Has she ever actually answered a question?
She can't answer a question.  She knows nothing.  She is dangerous.  Trump 2024 please!!!!!!!
Am I the only one who finds her voice incredibly annoying? with all the whining ugh
Kamala, what are the policies you keep bringing up but haven’t shown on your venn diagram?
I really think she handled the host well. If you ask a question and you dont allow me time to respond but instead ask something underneath and you want to continue talking when i am responding,  then guess what...i am going to talk over you as well . Well done madam vice president.
Why “interview” her if you don’t let her answer the question?
she gets A+ in never answering the question, she never fails proving she's an imbecile w/o an teleprompter. Disgrace that ppl are actually voting for her after last 4 yrs.
Guy just won’t shut up would he? He just keeps wanting to talk over someone. He asked a question and then won’t let her answer. Give her a minute to say something if you’re going to ask your questions.
Yall so mad she made Bret look like an idiot when those loaded questions blew up in his face
What about the black mother with a daughter with sickle cell.
This interviewer ask her questions like she was PRESIDENT,  the VICE PRESIDENT DON'T HAVE POWER TO DO MUCH!
Why do they keep avoiding the Ukraine part of this border bill.  That was the main reason they turned it down.  They had to agree to support Ukraine if they wanted the border bill to pass.
Can he put his eyebrows down 🤣🤣
How many times did she say Donald Trump?
What a horrible unprofessional interview. Fox is entertainment that isn’t entertaining.  Ask the question, let the person respond. It’s just that simple. Let the viewer decide if they like or dislike the response.
I just cannot see her having negotiations with tough world leaders if she is even just grilled by a reporter like this. She can't answer questions nor hold her ground. No doubt not anyone can become vice president of USA and even more run for president but the ultimate question now is if she really is fit to fill the shoes of a world leader.
Who went after peaceful protesrs in the last year Mme vice president?
10:31 does she want to be trumps Veep? Cause I don't think the job has an openings
*actually, what are you taking about?* lol
She just can't answer a question! She goes around in circles and makes no sense. It's all Trumps fault 🤣
Asking the question and interrupting when people answer is corner stone of republican 😂
How could anyone vote for her after watching one of her interviews
Wow really froze up when he asked about Walz
How does Fox News take itself seriously?  More importantly, how do Fox News viewers take it seriously?  The same people who rightfully point out than CNN and MSNBC are trash watch a network that is even more dishonest and biased.
He tried to play hardball and looked ridiculous not letting his questions
Shes an idiot.  She literally NEVER answers the question, she just sounds stupid.
13:42 what the actual? She can never answer a question. It's her good Trump bad. God please don't let me listen to her for four years.
She can’t even answer a single question😂 just the run around. Say one answer without saying trumps name😂 you look weak and pathetic.
Brett has shown his hand - he is a horrible human and pathetic man.  Let people answer a question.  Be independent.  Reporting is not having an agenda or spin to propagate  falsehoods and propaganda.  Shameful. Shameful. Shameful.  Disrespectful of the office and service.
How come there's no tax plan for a single or married people with no kids?
Why when she shakes her head her hair moves on her left but is still on her right 🤔
wasn't it the host who was grilled
Answer the question 😂
she doesn't have an answer because she can only blame others.
Funny how he asked for a number and she just completely avoided that
did she respond to anything?  I missed that, must have been in the br 🤮  i guess I'll go look up those policies of hers
Man how do you disrespect the vice president and browbeat this woman like that or even if it was a man!
Someone to interview her that finally won't let her skate around questions asked.
It’s really amazing to see her evade all questions and didn’t even answer one clearly.
When you ask a politician be it Trump or Harris, they all dance around the actual question.
Crazy how the very first question completely derailed her and it was just GG from that point. Kamala got rekt.
Why did Brett edit and adulterate and change Trump's answer from Trump's  own interview? This is frightening. This is why Fox got sued for almost 1 billion dollars. They will lie, cheat and steal from the truth. That video of the REAL words of Trump  is widely available. Trump has said that he intends to use the United States Military to find "the enemy within". Brett chose to edit, chop up that clip and not include Trump's statement. Why would Brett do that? Because Brett does not want Fox viewers to see the truth. BRETT is a liar. This is why Fox was sued in court. They do not want people to know what is really going on and they have bought up all of the markets in small towns and rural America because they know people are afraid and they have a captive audience. Fox, Brett, stop lying. America, wake up. We are not a Hollywood movie. We are a democracy.
Let her finish answering the question…stop trying to put the lie spin on things when the truth is in front of you. 😂
Donald Trump has been divisive?  What about Joe Biden's State Of The Union speech?  Why does she refuse to answer the question "What, SPECIFICALLY are you going to do?  And more importantly, why haven't you already done it?"
If yall call arguing with someone who is trying to answer the question a win for fox it’s shows while you guys are Trump supporters yall love asking questions and then yelling at someone before they answer
How can anybody be so full of crap??
Is she confused, or does she like blaming Trump for all her wrong decisions???
I’m not a fan of Harris and she didn’t do a great job here, however the interviewer was a lot worse imo. They weren’t having a dialogue nor discussion, just interrupting for posing a new question.
Kudos to Brett for asking the hard questions. He held her feet to the fire.
She is lost without a a clue
Did they fact-check her
Tell Bret to shut up and just ask questions. I think he still thinks Biden is running
This is how she always needs to be grilled, in all interviews. She never answers a question!
Answer the question!
Lol she’s definitely the queen of dodging questions.
Can she tell the truth about her and Joe has done to this country? Just wondering
The earrings again??? Every interview, same earrings...
Love how he never lets her answer a question before he batters her with extra bs lol he’s such a clown
Did the last 3 1/2 years happen???? Am I crazy that it seems like "the powers that be" are trying to focus on things that occurred 4 yrs ago
She is cooked. Can not and did not answer a single question.
She did well answering questions in an antagonistic interview. Not perfect, but well.
Well did anyone learn anything new about Kama-lier? I learned she eats sleeps and breathes Trump❤ Just like the American people. ❤️Trump 2024❤️
What’s the point of asking her questions that you won’t even allow her to answer?
What is she talking about???
Finally some good questions!!! Once again kamalalala can’t answer anything much less truthfully!!!!
6 democrats? just 6 dude.... really? what's the point there -_-
What is the name of the interviewer? He is great
As a neutral party here, why are you all proud of him cutting g her off? We need to HEAR the answers.
You guys do realize she’s not the current president, right?
She can't answer a question with a direct answer She has to dance around it and provide the word salad... Can you smell liar?
One simple question.. how is a felon allowed to run for president when fenlons all over the US aren't even allowed to vote!
every interview with same earings ? are they headset?
Had she not been 20 minutes late for the interview Brett wouldn’t have had to rush it and cut her off so much to redirect her to the actual question
How is this real
Is Kamala Harris's IQ less than 50. I think I got dumber listening to her speak.
The correct answer to the question at 18:10 is Bret and the Fox pundits looking into a mirror
Why get rid of something b4 you have a good replacement?
Who are the Republicans that were on the stage with her? She's mentioned it a few times....so who are they?
Did she forget we have been through a Trump administration and the economy was freakin great back then??!
cant stop talking to have a normal conversation just keeps japping over the questions
She’s not used to answering questions clearly wait until she gets more power
What plan?
Is she going to the shawn Ryan show ?
Every question-Let's understand how we got here.
These Liberal Democrats crawfish and avoid answering a question like it’s the plague…
Can she please answer the question without him interrupting her
The way she evade accountability how could anyone in their right mind marry and take her serious???
WHO LET HER COOK???
those estimates in "billions" for iran: are they lined to the inflation rate?
Did she answer any of questions? I didn’t get her any answers, I was lost.
I want to know why Kamala made 1.6 million in 2021 then about the same or less in 2022 but in 2023 she is only claiming 370,000 and what a coincidence she wants to tax 39% for people making over 400k a year something smells fishy and it’s not her coochie
6:01 people are funny…everyone is trying to make it seem like she’s dancing around the answer…when the reality is that the question is being asked in a demeaning way.  “Do you regret lifting the policies?”  For starters…she’s not the one that lifted anything…so how can she regret it being lifted…secondly…there was an attempt to put a different plan in effect that may have had some favor towards immigrants…but we are an immigrant friendly country…and that plan was sideswiped…so there’s literally no reason for her to regret anything or owe any apologies…but she can’t just say that…because it then destroys the image of her campaign…so instead she is forced to attempt to  explain that the issue was in fact imperative and was addressed but it was fought and there were a lot of issues to get to so it’s not like they could harp on an issue they’re being fought on…  Biden received a country that was heavily divided and in financial ruin while also navigating a pandemic that should’ve never made it past an epidemic…everything had to be addressed…and immigrants are still people that have complex situations…they deserve to be treated as such…lifting the policies was supposed to go hand in hand with the new policy…they got one and not the other and it turned disastrous…if they spent the entire term fighting over the border then absolutely nothing else would’ve gotten done and the things that ppl are trying to say took place actually would’ve…  It’s not evading a question if the question is designed to incriminate you…she’s a lawyer…she saw the setup coming a mile away…y’all gotta be smarter than that.
I get it, migrants and inflation are important issues which need to get fixed, but is worth loosing democracy in the US by voting for Trump?
What “solutions” did her and Joe create while in office?  Practically nothing got done
Quite disappointing when the person being interviewed isn't given the respect to respond to a question. This was very unprofessional from Fox and people expect more.
6:01 people are funny…everyone is trying to make it seem like she’s dancing around the answer…when the reality is that the question is being asked in a demeaning way.  “Do you regret lifting the policies?”  For starters…she’s not the one that lifted anything…so how can she regret it being lifted…secondly…there was an attempt to put a different plan in effect that may have had some favor towards immigrants…but we are an immigrant friendly country…and that plan was sideswiped…so there’s literally no reason for her to regret anything or owe any apologies…but she can’t just say that…because it then destroys the image of her campaign…so instead she is forced to attempt to  explain that the issue was in fact imperative and was addressed but it was fought and there were a lot of issues to get to so it’s not like they could harp on an issue they’re being fought on…  Biden received a country that was heavily divided and in financial ruin while also navigating a pandemic that should’ve never made it past an epidemic…everything had to be addressed…and immigrants are still people that have complex situations…they deserve to be treated as such…lifting the policies was supposed to go hand in hand with the new policy…they got one and not the other and it turned disastrous…if they spent the entire term fighting over the border then absolutely nothing else would’ve gotten done and the things that ppl are trying to say took place actually would’ve…  It’s not evading a question if the question is designed to incriminate you…she’s a lawyer…she saw the setup coming a mile away…y’all gotta be smarter than that.
the questioned he should have asked is: "If Trump was so bad... what did she did to fix it?!"
What a joke. Answer a question
This imbecile won't answer a single question. She uses all the words to say nothing. She needs to be in a rubber room and be tested.
All she wants to do is slam donald trump ans cant answer sny question she sucks!!! Shes absolutely awful!!!!!!!
Trump was in office 4 years, if he did such a good job why did he lose the last election?
Dude wouldn’t shut the front door after asking a question
I guess she was expecting a lot of softball questions and got thrown 100mph fastball the whole time. She tried to get ahead of the count and Bret shut she down every time. This is the type of real interview our “political leaders “ need to have on a consistent basis!
Best questions raised in this short 20 minutes ever.
She refused to answer the question about Biden‘s capacities. Clearly circumnavigating to avoid answering. Again going to Donald Trump.
Why is she sooo nasal all the time!!!!????? Her voice kills me
This guy is absolutely weird as interviewer. He doesn't have brain to let her answer his question and just loudly speak for next question when understand that she will answer it. Need to be an idiot to not notice it. When people do that in conversation means they tries to manipulate dialog and show only picture they want, not to get real answer and listen to that. Stupid guy
So she won't even answer that question abc was wayyyyy harder in trump and she had an ear piece she can't answer any questions not at all!!!!! Omg who would vote for this!!!!
Not a single question was answered that day
Never answered 1 question.  Dumb
Bro is she failing that bad she goes to fox to recruit republicans
How can anyone vote for harris, you can choose not to vote for anyone.
Any question : "Well in Donald Trump's administration....."
only one pair of ear rings ?
I’m asking the questions but remember I’m not interested in your response, because I have an hidden agenda and will talk over you at every opportunity.
Really poor interviewing.
Joe has the experiment? Hmm. 21:22
She’s a disaster and Trump is past it, dear God but is this what America is reduced to?
She didn't answer a single question. Deflected or redirected every single time.
I admire his probing questions, and she failed miserably.
I admire his probing questions, and she failed miserably.
Is she his Baby Mama??? I swear to god she sounds like a bitter entitled babymama!!!
Where did her southren accent go to?
Why wasn’t Palestine and Israel genocide questions asked? Why are we supporting Israel and Ukraine?
If you can't answer a question, change the subject and blame the opposition for something else which has no relevance to the original question.
This woman dances around every hard question. I'm glad you asked that question, that is a good question,let me answer that question, wait, what was the question? Never a straight answer. I'd like to finish, yes please finish. For Pete's sake
Why cant she answer just ONE question without blaming all her problems on Trump?  She's such a twat!
Trying to filibuster the first question...haha...nothing in that brain...
Why ain't you doing this now?
17:34 what are you talking about?
Is she really this stupid? 😢😢
She just dodges the questions and rambles on and on to run out the clock.
12:01  would you advocate? No answer. Redirect to Trump and his policies.
9:18  do you still support that?
Is this interview? Jesus!!  Is this man Republican?  As an interviewer you have to  stay neutral.
“Why do ppl trust Trump when it comes to economics?” Good question. Why do those people choose to believe a narcissist who bankrupted a casino and doesn’t know how tariffs work over economic scholars?
Why is Kalama wearing the same earrings in every interview? Clearly someone is telling her what to say!
I don’t think she had clearly answered even one of his questions, she’s great on deflecting the question, but not answering it…..babbles on & on….talks alot but says nothing!
Is this an interview or an interrogation?
This is one dumb woman, won't answer a question, I think I hate her for what she helped do to Americans.
Ask your question… shut up and wait for an answer… if they don’t answer have a follow up.   Basic      Now go watch a trump interview on this joke of a news organisation and see if the so called reporter behaves in the same way.  Pathetic.
The look on her face when Brett asked about Bidens mental decline was PRICELESS!!! 🤣🤣
What is she going to do to stop the illegal immigration and get them out?
Why didn’t he shut her down
Where is her responsibility for her administration? 😤
How can people listen to her talk and think she's making any sense at all?
Let her speak after you have asked her a question.
He asked a whole bunch of questions and never even gave her the opportunity to fully answer anything you people are ridiculous
Does she have any friends?
Again at 12:50... ask her the details of her plan...
She fought to answer the question, but didn't answer the question.
Questions answers in this interview: 0
it is very refreshing to see her being asked some real questions
Answer the GD question,
The beginning of the interview HE shouldve asked her pronouns.
What is she saying nothing.
Basic interview skills lacking in this guy 😂
Does she not understand that the Republicans supporting her are considered horrible and evil by conservatives and independents?
This is an interview of Trudeau in his favorite dressup, isn't it?   Answers questions exactly the same.  They are both globalist puppets.
After 3 minutes I couldn't listen to this verbal diarrhea anymore... is she still talking....
Locking ppl up they dont agree with is exactly what Democrats tried to do? All the lawfare against Trump?
Was this a debate or an interview?
Why not let the woman speak?
Indian twist on chickin neckin. Is she new?
Why doesn't she ever answer the question? She avoids the answer everytime
She seems to think that babbling on and on will cause people to forget what the question
Do men experience actual pain when women speak, making them constantly interrupt, talk over & man-splain? Did that watermelon-head almost explode off his shoulders every time she spoke?
the botox bigot asks a question and interrupts as she tries to answer with actual INFO to support the answer! something trump can't do without mentioning himself or repeating his derogatory  terms. just submitted my poll for Harris-Walz yesterday :)
What are your policies?????????
You have to admire the balls to walk in to the lion's den, knowing what was coming but man, you have to answer the questions ffs!
Wasn't this supposed to be an hour long interview?
Dam she couldn't even be clear or upfront with even the 1st question😂😂😂
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Right off the bat she completely dodges the very first question 🤦🏻‍♂️  She is really good at that, she almost fooled me😂 almost went on to the next question 😋
She was the vice president doing delegation tasks from Biden, what do you think she should have done differently??? She was not a free agent, she had a boss, why would you think she would have done anything differently
Scary, did the headset die?
Is she capable of answering questions at all??
That is AWESOME. It's like a psychotic break in real-time!! She can't answer a single question with anything but deflection or she knows she's finished!! Ask about her policy, hear about Trump. Can she actually hear Bret's questions because she seems to be having a conversation with someone else? This has got to be parody, right? Is this a Trump AD?? It should be. Bret may have finally exposed her and changed the world.
Are you serious @b4ltm0re_jay, did you even watch the whole video? And if you DID, that would be the question WERE YOU EVEN PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE WAS SAYING
She took on the previous admin’s non productive work, and this guy keeps cutting her off after asking a question.
Does she realize Donald Trump has not spent his majority in government
Why is she gaslighting him?
If the border mattered why did you give up on it after day 1?
These were bad questions. More polarizing yellow jacket tabloid reporting. This election shouldn’t be about personality it needs to be about policy.
This woman can’t answer a simple question. I hope people see this and realize that this woman is nowhere near qualified to be President nowhere near qualified.
This will be remembered as the pivotal moment where Kamala Harris infamously imploded and self destructed her campaign - she couldn't even give direct answers to simple questions about policy. They weren't even trick "gotcha" questions - they were rational, relevant questions about important topics such as the border, the economy and foreign aid.
What if I don’t want either candidate?
What a liar you someone’s lying when they never answer the question
Brett, you asked good questions but you have to let her answer the questions. It’s rude and disrespectful to talk over her and not let her answer your questions. Why bother asking if you don’t let her talk
She can’t answer a single question 😅
Question is does she hear herself?  And how does she keep a straight face??? Amazing
Does she have another pair of earrings?
Redflags I observed:  1. Not answering direct questions  2. Word salad after word salad  3. Blaming Trump for everything   4. Trying to burn time by talking over the host  5. Changing her views to benefit her current audience
Why was our country safer and prospering when President Trump was in office.
And what the hell are you doing?! Sitting here belittling Trump the whole time! Tell us what YOU are going to do to make a difference! 😡
Kamala if you're turning the page on rhetoric then why are you talking rhetoric b.s. about the past blaming others instead of taking responsibility for the last 4 years of massive price increases inflation, the wars and hostilities internationally between the USA and other nations while you go running off to sorority parties instead of meeting with world leaders who come to the USA to discuss potential World War 3 issues?
Trump could never answer hard questions like that
She dodged every question, and the ones that she did respond to, she seemed to think that she could beat us into submission by using an ocean of words that ultimately said nothing....
Wasn't this supposed to be a debate?
I think at this point we would just like her to answer just one question without deflecting using Donald Trump!!!
What, no live fact checking?
I cant stand her or her talking about anything else but the questions
Fox you SUCK!!  This is a completely biased interrogation, not an interview?  Who the F keeps interviewing the interviewee?  This is the most unprofessional interview the world has EVER seen!
I still want to know why she never chose to go to the border. She could’ve even tagged along with a one or two times Biden went?
OMG! She cannot answer 1 question concisely 😢
Why not ask if she blew her way up the career ladder?
Can she hear  you with  them earrings.
Keep deflecting questions. Refuses to answer question directly.
Why can't we "skip" the Harris ad?
Can I at least get some dressing for this salad 🥗
LOL! "What are you talking about?"
Typical Kamala deflection to the question and blaming Trump
She lost can't answer a question only spread hate and lies she seems unhinged
She just cant find it in herself to actually answer any question. Always walking around it
How much botox is too much botox?  Brett doesn't know.
Wow! If Kamala can’t handle Brett questioning how can she handle world leaders she can’t to weak. TRUMP!!❤❤️💪💪🇺🇸🇺🇸
not one question answered, not one
How many Homes did BLackrock buy and now rent out, 200,000? People could buy them?
Who’s read both, Trump’s 16 page plan and Harris’s 82 page plan?
Now when is Trump going on MSNBC?
He asks a questions doesn’t let her finish then asks another question lol 😂 buddy is to excited 😛
She’s so rude! Takes way too long to NOT answer a question!
"What would you like for dinner?"  "I will follow the law!"  "Would you like Italian, ranch, Blue Cheese or Thousand Island with your word salad?"
15:32 does Kamala realize that a wide swath of Democrats ranging from RFK Jr. to Tulsi Gabbard have been welcomed by Trump into his camp?
DO YOU NOTICE THE EARRINGS? SHE WEARS THOSE SAME EARRINGS WHEN EVER SHE'S INTERVIEWED. SAME FROM THE DEBATE. Everyone knows she doesn't make sense when she talks, I bet those are mic'd up🤨
Is there any question she can answer without going back to the barrel of curated answers from the greeting cards in her head?
Does she have any opinions besides Trump's fault??
YouTube’s keeping the comments on?
Why hasn’t she done anything for the American ppl in almost four years?
If you wanted to fix the problem, why would you repel the measures holding the wave BEFORE your "border bill" was approved?
What im having a hard time understanding is how she went from 4%  approval  in her 2020 run..to  suddenly a VP ??? To NOW a presidential candidate..what did she do in 3 years to garner so much support Now.. can anyone note a  notable public appearance ishes made in last 3 years?  And why she spent 10 months of her first 2 years as VP in her Brentwood mansion instead of Washington?  Vote wisely
Is this the whole interview  or is it there more ?
She said experiment instead of experience……. That’s odd
When people ask about illegal immigration the question should be how many refugees did the United States create through destroying their country either through proxy wars or overthrowing their democratically elected Leaders with a military coup.
She sounds like socialist plus communist?
This guy did not let her speak. Why is she wasting her time with this joker.
Why was this video not showing up in my suggestion videos? Hmmm YouTube censorship?
George Clooney is your source though? 😅 both sides are hilarious
the disrespect from Brett when he would not let her answer, whether he disagrees or agreed, please for the love just let each other answers the question and have a small amount of time to speak, i am TIRED of people continuing to interrupt and talk over each other that has not stopped for years.
Omg when she talks we go in circles how the f did she get here
Is she campaigning for Donald Trump?😂
Did anyone ask trump if he felt bad a black woman died in a parking lot giving birth to a dead baby.?
Politician trick: instead of answering the question, discuss what you want regarding the topic of the question.
I wonder how Trump's supporters will cope after November 5. They'll need some copium 😅😅
He has not allowed her finished any of his questions.  🤦🏽‍♀️
April or October??? Holy Crapazoid. That's a hell of a lot of difference
I would have liked her to have actually answered ONE question!  Pathetic!
When you ask a question if you want to hear the answer you stay quiet, otherwise you're just asking the question to highlight the question not to hear an answer. Kudos to Kamala for not backing down
This is whats it like when you ask chatgpt a question, you don't get a direct concise answer.
Why wasn't any of it done? During their term.
Didnt her and Joe sell off the steel from the border Wall ?
She just can't answer any of these questions 😅
People are going to drive to work or whatever. Wouldn’t you rather them know the laws and learn to drive than to get behind the wheel blindly?
Word salad without actually answering the question.
Why did it take until a few weeks ago for her policy to hit her website trumps has been up since the start smh she's should be charged with treason knowing bidens condition for 4 years and letting him run the country into the ground
Why didn’t she answer the questions here instead of directing everyone to her website?
She skirted EVERY question.
These are completely inane questions about things that don't affect peoples lives. People need economic help and she has an actual plan instead of a revenge list.
3:44 why does she wear those ear buds/earrings all the time??
Just like Trump and every political candidate, Kamala never ever directly responds to a question…. 90% of Americans would be fired yielding a position of responsibility neglecting a response. Even a judge in court would have called a recess
Every time she was onto an answer Brett couldn’t pummel her for he just talked over her with another pointed question. What does interviewing like that do for your viewers?
Answer the question! When did you know about Biden’s decline.
Are there any of the 115k comments that show support for her?!😂
Can we find these cases she keeps talking about?
Imagine interviewing and not answering a single question.
She can't answer 1 question 😮
Once again no answers
The blame game!!! Why isn’t Harris not owning up to her time as VP??
Who is this random woman and why is she even talking?
What type of Caucasian is she?
What in the actual fuk
Deflect deflect deflect never answered a single question,  lying kamala untruthful with every breathe.
Did she answer any question???
She got pissed to the point of losing her composure this much in 20 minutes? Yikers
When is Trump going on MSNBC?...
Ask kamala personal question its always Donald Trump
Wait, you never demean “MAGA?” Call them a threat to democracy? Minions following Trump? I have heard all those messages in democratic rallies
She avoids directly answering questions like Neo avoids bullets in the Matrix 😂
She can’t even answer a question
Brett is pretty terrible at interviewing.
Has anyone noticed that Kamala Harris wears the same earrings to every news interview.  The same ones she wore at the debate.
Are Americans that dumb to vote for Kamala to be the President of USA? She does not even know what she's talking about, she can't even take accountability on her failures as a VP! Such a disgrace.
Did you say that?? Well trump didn’t say that
Shes killing time, dragging on questions with hogwash to avoid more questions
Typical man won't shut up so she can finish answering the question.
I’m gonna keep watching by I’m less than a minute in and he already asked a question and didn’t let her answer. Was she avoiding it? Of course, she’s a politician. But are you here to interview her or yourself?   Bad start. Hope it gets better
What a farce!  She cannot answer a simple question!!
enemy within...hmmmm
If my boss asks me a question and I spend 3 minutes speaking words without ever answering the question, it would only happen once before I would be escorted from the building.
Her not answering a question is exhausting
She’s always wearing those earrings y’all…can someone check those PLZZZZZ!
Did anyone else notice her chair is a few inches taller?
Who is Grandma Beryl, Kamala?
Why doesn't she get it that she created the problem in the first place... Oh Denial and Deception...
Wow, this lady makes my ears bleed.. Can she not answer a question with a direct answer? Everything she says comes off as dishonest.
Why cant she answer a simple direct question
why does she talk like a narcissistic caretaker? oh wait, joe Biden.
We have a like and dislike button, where's the lmao button?
Did she ever answer a question?  WHAT A JOKE!!!!
So many stupid questions from Baier. "Do you want to apologize?" "What are you turning the page on?" He's trying so hard to keep everything about vibes and soundbites.  "Why do people support trump if he's bad?" This is anti-journalism.
genuinely how is mr brett doing a good job if all he did was talk over the person he's supposed to be interviewing...?
Why is there a housing shortage in the U.S.?
Let her finish answering the question you asked. Good gawd, the bias is palpable. Worst thing (or best case considering the clear bias), she rambles incoherently like Trump does. Rebuttals are fine and dandy, but let her finish. A return for decorum and courtesy.
Where be her accent Rasta  Oye Chico where is her accent  Ya betta thanka her accents missin
He clearly broke her with Biden's mental stability question. What a punch there.
She can’t even answer ONE question!!!! OMG!!! It’s ridiculous!!! No way any American would want Her as President…..NO WAY!!! TRUMP/VANCE 2024🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Why did Fox go so easy on her?
Where is the whole interview??
Why does this guy keep interpreting
Is this the person that wants to go to Joe Rogan Podcast? She will be skinned alive over there lol
"What are you turning the page from?"  My man here asking the most important questions :D
She won't answer the question.  Let's get to the point.
Why do politicians have everyone fooled? They come up with bill after bill and tell us how hard they work at every chance when really all that is needed is a cup full of common sense with a sprinkle of reason and compassion. Farmers and steel workers work hard.
Trump never answers the question. He sidesteps everything. You people who are criticizing her are absolute cultists.
Anyone else ready to be unburdened by what has been?
Kamala accuses Trump of threatening to use military force against civilians? One month ago the DoD re-released directive 5240.01. Now it allows military to use lethal force against civilians and it is publicly released.
OMG,  did he ever actually let her answer a question.  He talked over her, interrupted, man-splained...sheesh.  Oh, and she handed him his lunch despite it all.
yes or no questions- to stop a rambler- and redirect to the question.....
answer the questions
She should never have agreed to an interview with this horrible media company. If it's an interview, ask questions not monologues and overtalking your interviewee. This is just an awful media company. It's not a news company. It's incredibly disrespectful.
She tring her hardest to dodge the questions.
Finally someone asking some serious questions. So tired of people licking her but hole and acting like she’s perfectly capable to run the country.
Bret if you want to interview her again keep it to just 3 or 4 questions.  And make sure to give them to her several days in advance.
Interviewer-Kamala, for the love of god, please answer the question.  Kamala- I grew up in a middle class family, but lets talk about Trump...
That clown answered only ONE question. The rest was “but Trump…” and BS fillibuster
which 79%? its like going to different Universe when you talk to faux and chump zombies my GOD!
Did you need border agents when you flew the Haitians to Springfield,Ohio ?
Question was Biden when did you notice he was going downhill?  Answer Donald Trump is definitely unstable
Couldn’t answer a single question
Why does everyone still call it a "border security" bill? It was a foreign war bill! Only $20B of $118B would have gone to the border.  That's like telling someone you're working late, working for a few minutes, and spending the night at the bar.
Will she ever answer any questions
Literally didn't answer one question
21:45 The question is your honesty, and you are not honest.
Why didn't she go to the border before now? And her policies will help the economy? Yea right.  Lining thier pockets and hurting Americans making them rely on the government
😮 yes but how what are the plans what is your plan where is a list of a breakdown for me I'm just a common low life American and I ain't heard a plan yet😂
26 mins of nothing answered and nothing said is crazy
20:23 And you should be able to handle a simple question without losing it.
She is talking in circles.  She can’t answer any questions straight.  Her voice sounds at times like she’s whining to keep from crying.
Lol.. why dies she keep talking about Trump.. the questions are..what are u gonna do..
First question and shes right away to pandering 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This guy is a terrible interviewer.
Why isn’t Biden on the ballot?  She can’t answer the dang question.
How long are we going to tolerate this crap?
He’s trying to get to the point lady answer the freaking question
Would this interview really make a difference since they can still be able to rig the election for their advantage?
why does he keep interrupting her...  she really cant maintain composure or articulate ideas well under pressure tho... wasnt she a lawyer?
Country continues to be dumbed down ; how can immigrants be “illegal” if admitted legally?  Average US citizen is unable to process this reasoning…sadly!
If we know what we need, why isn’t it happening? We ALWAYS KNOW what we need, but for some reason.. IT NEVER HAPPENS.
Didn't answer the question
What is she talking about? I have never heard those things? I have heard her say similar.
She hasn’t increased punishments for illegal crossings at all?! Who is getting these punishments?
She got spanked!!! He kept bringing her back to the questions and she still couldn’t answer anything.
The experiment is that what you were about to say is this all just practice to you just goofing around like America and its people are your toys
Does she own another pair of earrings? She is always wearing the pearl earbuds.
Just one question is all should take to conclude everything  When asked about President Biden’s mental ability and if that answer is an absolute hoax answer, what right do you have to assess President Trump.? Simple as that….
How is the $25k tax credit for first time home buyers going to be funded? Oh right, more taxes.
Question the people wanna know why are you sending all that money over there?: answer: Donald Trump.
My question is. Do they only vote on a border security bill every four years ? 😂
Question the people wanna know why are you sending all that money over there?: answer: Donald Trump.
Gosh, her ramblimg is so frustrating. Just answer the question without all the fluff and referring to anyone else.
I just wonder when god will strike her down when every word out of her mouth is a lie?  My god she is disgusting.
When is somebody going to laugh in her face? I’m serious, like she is no better than any other person, and if any other person gave me the answers she gave, I would LAUGH OUT LOUD in their face. Doo better FOX
She’s like a deer with headlights shining on her after every question 😂
question: when did you notice something was wrong with Joe Biden answer: Trump is unfit to run for president
You keep talking but how are you going to do this
She has probably never had to answer a question honestly.  She doesn’t know how to be honest. The Bible says “ you can’t make straight what is crooked, and you can’t make crooked what is straight.”
VP DOES NOT have lots of authorities. question to you all, do you say NO to your boss? If you do then you get fired. She just a VP.
6:09 Kamala, answerr the question! Joe may not be on the ballot, but you are. And you've be derelict in executing on your responsibilities to the american people by not acknowledging bidens' mental incapacity and removing him!!!!!
Bret Baier did a very good job at putting a stop to Kamala trying to fillibuster , campaign, deflect the blame back to Trump,  and never answering the question.  I think the best campaign strategy Trump could ever come up with is let Kamala go it alone and put her buffonery on display.
30 minutes of questions and not one answer. Wild.
I have a question: When did the Vice President stop having responsibility for the government administration she represents? I ask, because I don't understand why Mrs. Kamala says "I'm not Biden" but she is the Vice President of the Biden administration, she is also responsible for everything from this administration.
The 79% question made me laugh so freaking hard it was unreal. This woman is stupid. Kamala go have another drink.
So like, isn't the point of an interview to ask questions and then listen to the answers? No wonder no one watches Fox News any more...
"If trump is as bad as you say, why is half of America still voting for him?"  Unfortunately the answer to this question that there is a significant amount of voting power in his favor who are relatively uneducated. He's previously said a few things that really resonated with these voters and come fact or fiction to these statements, they're going to die on this hill.
At least the vice president can answer a question !
Is Kamala on drugs…seriously..? And alcohol.  She’s using something.!
If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a question!
I just asked my husband about this trance, gender stuff. Thank you for bringing it up.
She can't even answer one question correctly 🙄
New generation of politics? She turns 60 in just a few days.
Talking over someone is not how you interview it took her like 5 times to actually answer. Good questions that needed to be asked but geez let the lady answer
This host dude is super aggressive and doesn’t matter. Finish the question without talking over her.
Question: do you regret releasing them, murderers? Answer.: rambling word salad.😂
11:28 serious question here. What is a medical necessity that justifies the need to change someones gender?
where is the salad dressing
And that my friend is a typical politician, who doesn’t answer the question…. And doesn’t take accountability for what she’s done. What a joke.
Really? Why  the "politician speak" speak like a person! and II'm trump hater
question, donald trump is the answer 😂
She can’t answer one question. You can tell  when someone else is telling her in her ear what to say. Watch her how she stops mid sentence, her eyes wondering. And she stutters or changes up the word.
How do you spell America Madame Vice President.. C...A...N...A...D...A.. America..See my mother's friend, who was a small business owner,thought me to spell..
How does she sleep at night?
Pay attention he ask her about that Trump is unstable!!!, she stumble when he asked about Biden, she had no idea what you going to say😂😂😂
How many times did Donald Trump's name come out of her mouth in this interview??
Anybody ever heard of an 80 page resume? Anything over 2 and I don't even read them. How do you go from no policies listed or even talked about for the most part to having 80 pages of policies on your website.  Someone should do a search to see how much is just copy-paste. My guess is all of it besides a few lines from a writer and editor.
So satisfying to see harris getting interviewed the way trump gets interviewed all the time. No softball questions and the interviewer not allowing her to lie and get away with not answering without the interviewer calling her out for not answering the questions I the most polite way possible
Why is it that attacking Israel means that has American blood on its hands? When did Israel become America? Why is the defense of another country the highest priority of our government?
Does this woman ever STOP blaming Trump?
A simple question but she goes and waste time and never answers😅
How many illegal immigrants  that have been let into the country over the passed 3 years will be voting in the upcoming election?
What are these plans she keeps talking about?
Serious question though, does border patrol support Harris?
Let’s talk about what does she know this is awlful ugh and she is going to fix what? lol judges at the wall???
She literally circles around ever question instead of answering them
If Joe Biden’s presidency was so great why change it?
She just dances around the questions and ignores the truth she tail chases like a dog in a circle
and you wonder why she had 3/4 of her staff walk out on her over the last almost 4 years.  What a bee-otch
Was this an interview or debate? This guy has a weird face lift.
Then why wasn't this her top priority?!!!! She was IN CHARGE OF OUR BORDER!!!!! She needs to go back to work at Mcdonalds!
why is the US financing a genocide?
Is he going to let her talk? Or he know that her answer are going to make logical sense and he can’t have that on fox? So he has to cut her off constantly?
I'm watching just the first question and she's a complete failure already. Failure. Completely.
Is this woman an adult ?
What kind of interviewer ask a question and then doesn't give the person time to answer. He is so rude, talking over her and trying not to let her answer. This is some FOX NEWS MESS, just like Fox News. A Hot Mess, glad she held her own.
This animal do not directly answer questions
Those questions Brett… What a start 👏🏾
Like c'mon is she going to answer questions or attempt a campaign speech? Gj Brett
What was the question?
never heard anyone talk sooo long and yet say nothing...just dance around the question with no real answer
Does this moron EVER answer a question?
oh my goodness what happened?She didn't know what to say what country she say
Not one direct answer.
She can't answer questions hahahaha
is she indian or black \? WHO TO BLAME? LOL
Thank you so much for actually giving her hard questions compared to softball ones from other media
Any former court Prosecutor has to know when they're asked direct questions, not to change the subject, and not answer the questions.
Does she know ANY of her policies? They've been told what to do so long she doesn't even know what her job is.
It's wonderful to see her attempt to answer real questions but it shows how empty her words actually are
If it needs to be fixed, why let anyone in until it is?
i'm from Europe. is this person for real?😮
Why is she wearing those ear bud earrings again?
Why doesn't  she answear the question,  he will be president  again
Bret: Madam Vice President, let me ask you about President Biden's age, about President Obama's birth certificate, and about President Clinton's adrenochrome consumption . . . . Kamala: [Holds up a hand to ask for patience while she gulps down another mug of Fox Newslike Product tears] Okay, now, to answer your question....
How is this person going to deal with China & Russia ?
The point is, she rrefuses to get to the point and answer the question. And dhe is rude and snide. WOW!  LIES
Bret roasted her why did she even do this interview ?
Joe Biden is still sharp ?  Sharp as an Apple.
Answer the question you were asked
She's seem to be coming unhinged and can't seem to listen to a simple question without having to be right or rude..no joy here..
How does someone talk so much yet says NOTHING
Answer the question 😂😭 what a buffoon
First question and I’m already tired of hearing the deflections!!
It’s about time this dumb turd is questioned by a tough interviewer.
she doesn't know how to answer questions.
What a LOADED question in the first 90 seconds. "Some of those people were men who did crimes. Explain that!" I don't know, are some of your neighbors serial killers? Would you have any clue? Do we kick them out just to be safe?
Does dude have enough plastic surgery?
She didnt answer one question all she did was beat around the busch.shes not good under pressure ha ha ha lol
Why will she not answer any of the questions
Let me be clear... obviously NOT clear. That's why he has to keep asking the same question or rephrase it to dumb it down for her. She can neither follow nor  answer a question!
Is she for real ?
Diversionary tactics…..very useful when you have no answers to any question!
When are we going to wake up and realize that politics is horse shi?
She is great at not answering directly
Why yall focused on immigration instead of housing? Companies buy houses and turn them into airbnbs, just stop them from buying or at least increase taxes for them and let them leave the houses alone for the single family people…
13:19 - Slip that she’s just the face of the machine?
She is always afraid of the next question that may again expose her ignorance. What a pity
So who is dumber? Her or all the people who support her?
Wait, didn't she recently say something about being unburdened by what has been? But she keeps blaming everything on Trump.
She doesn't like being pushed to actually answer questions lol😂
He’s being too polite. I appreciate some of these questions but he’s letting her spin her web too much.
.....yes or no? why the rambles....
He asks one loaded question, she starts to answer, then he immediately interrupts her, then slightly changes the question and attacks her for not answering. I know Fox Brain Rot goes deep, but it's impossible for any of you to think this is what an interview looks like, right?
If the question was... Given that any number between 5 and 7 will suffice, what is 3 + 3?... You still wouldn't get an answer of ANY number by this waffling wannabe...
*asks about a policy* "Donald trump did thing" she can't get trumps name out of her mouth, she's so lost LOL
Answer straight to the question please India lady !!!!!
Australian here! Is it just me or are there other people wondering about the earrings? 😊
She can't even answer a question. Just dances around it.
first question. how many illegal aliens came into the US since trump left Office.  no answer - or unable to answer.  you would think a lawyer that handled around 10 cases in her career would be able to talk better. another example:  WHEN did you notice Byden couldn't do the job anymore?   no answer.  follow up question, no answer.
Kamala sounds like she's always reading a fortune cookie with her sayings, but never answers the question. I really don't understand it.
Great Job Brett!!! Great questions...no answers. But NO ONE actually expected any TRUE answers anyway!!!!
Sooooo why hasn't she done anything to help people while in office??
Wth is she talking about?
Why is she always wearing those same earrings during every interview
Hahahaha answer the question! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I can't with the salad mix bowl!!
Hahahaha answer the question! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I can't with the salad mix bowl!!
Was this an interview or a debate??
Not so clear
If she knew the dangers of open borders then how does one reason why she'd support opening the borders for all without vetting?
Does this person think the United States is a democracy?
How is she not going to continue Joe Biden's  Policies? Joe said himself she had a say in everything he did! She is the Biden administration! Exactly what is the new path???
Did she even answer 1 question?
This guys a real prick. Asks a leading question and doesn’t wait for an answer.
Why didn't Fox let the interview go on longer?  Lol
I don’t understand if Biden hasn’t declined how come he’s not on the ballot?
If she didn’t do anything because of Trump then what gives? He is still alive! And she will always blame someone.
Deflection!  She still doesn’t answer any question, has no plan. Talks about Trump in circles to avoid the questions. Sickening.
Where in the constitution does it say this is a democracy? I’ll wait
Can we get a third candidate please? Oh wait...
So why is this one border bill the hill to die on? So it didn’t go through and you quit and give up for 3.5 years??
In case you don't have time to watch it, it's: 30% non-answers 70% Trump is baaaaaad
She still can’t give a straight answer to any question!   She talks in circles.   Idiot!
Is this the kamala with hidden microphone or the kamala who do a cant do a interview ?
I love how she says let me get to the point and then she spends five minutes walking around the question while not answering it.
How anyone can vote for this lady is beyond me.
Does she ever actually answer a question?
An interview where questions can't get answered because Kamala gets interrupted all the time. You want to get answers or just ask questions? Then let her speak!
If Joe Biden died, she would have to step up as President of the United States?
one of her greatest talents is not answering basic questions
Very nasty questions from a fake news reporter.  Felt more like an argument than an interview.
She cannot answer a simple question for the love of country...
Is it only 26 min? I'm just checking this is the full interview. Gonna watch later.
Libs / Dems have been more divisive over the past 4 years than anyone. Also, does she have an identity outside of Donald Trump?
The clowns probably wanted her to stop taking questions and start awkwardly dancing and moving around like their ringmaster.
Why does Bret baier allow her to sit there and make up stuff that was never said by him or any of his people
Answer the questions!
Freaking POLLS are a farce. They make up the nbrs. NOTHING from MSM is legit. Have you woken up yet? This is a teaching video on HOW to NOT answer a question and to refocus the subject matter to something else.
Sorry, not sorry.  Answer the question!!!  She is useless
answer the questions lady
If he’d have let her go at her pace they would’ve have gotten through 2 full questions with ZERO clear answers. It’s so sad they don’t know their own policies. We genuinely want to know WHAT one half of this country supports, but that much is still unclear.
60 seconds in and she's already dodged the question twice and turned it into an argument. Fantastic.
Why didn't he let her talk. And when did those men come into the country that came into the USA? And why is he supporting Trump who did not adhere to the laws. Broke families up and allowed children to be molested by older children, allowed children to get sick and die while being in cages sleeping on concrete floors.
When did you noticed Bidens mentally unstable ?
does anyone notice at around 24:10 she’s talking extremely slow and taking awkward pauses? and then a couple seconds later, bret acknowledges someone behind the camera despite their still being plenty of time? and then it almost seems as she’s chewing the clock out at the end with the rambling, very strange im surprised no one is talking about this…
Enemy within? Look in the mirror Kamel.
Why havent you given Americans support when natural disasters have happened? You instead gave BILLIONS OF TAX PAYERS MONEY TO Ukraine! What is going on here? FEMA said our country doesn't have enough money to help our OWN COUNTRY! WHAT IS GOONG ON??
You notice how she won't answer with a yes or no when asked questions
Girl what u talking about u need ur note cards????
Where are the cackles?
Brett is intelligent and refuses to allow the other person who is Kamala to simply answer the question without interrupting. She presents context first without going to the perverse bottom line which makes zero sense in anything. Everything in life has context.
She is a dumb !! She has not answered one single question!! She just dances around them!!
A deer in the headlights
How come when you read comments from liberal media its 100% pro liberal comments, and when you read comments from conservative media posts its 100% pro conservative comments?
Total wasting of time asking questions to this moron.
What a fuckn liar, still can't answer a question.
She did an answer single question but spoke quite a bit about the other guy. I guess that's what happens when you have nothing to talk about except for failures
How on Earth anyone will vote for her is beyond understanding. She's been the Vice President for nearly 4 years, everything that has happened is her fault.
His strategy was to ask loaded questions where reasonable truthful answers would make anyone look bad, so it forced her to set up context and then interrupt her to throw her off.
Why does he keep talking over her? He wouldn’t let her answer a single question lol why even ask if your just guna interrupt ?
Kamala how about a plan and answering the question instead of trashing Trump? I want to know what you stand for?
So, is she running for the head of Israel or the United States?
Jesus Christ, this is ridiculous. Every single question. He asks her, she rambles an answer. That's not even a real answer. And every answer has Donald Trump's name in it, even when he's not asking her anything about donald trump.
She can’t answer a question, she flip flops on her position, she refuses to take any accountability for her time in office. Why can’t people see this? She is the worst…
I would like to know how many times she said Trumps name.  She’s running on if you hate Trump enough, you’ll vote for me.
Can she answer a single question?
Why she hasn’t done it????🤦‍♀️👎
Anyone feel her apology was not a real apology if you feels bad about it why not call them or send thoses who killed Americans back to there country
I’ll give Kamala one thing, she knows how to avoid answering questions like a true politician
Who was wrapping him very hard?  Fox?
It's great to ask questions HOWEVER you have to allow one a REAL CHANCE to answer the questions.
Donald Trump hasn’t done anything but word salads for years,he never answers questions & usually goes off talking about something totally unrelated but we want to criticize her for not answering questions? She’s trying but he keeps talking over her. Trump would be talking about Hannibal Lector or being friends with Putin.
Does she ever answer a question?
How many times did she say Donald Trump in this interview?
How many times did she say Donald Trump in this interview?
There yes or no questions
He asked about her, not Trump.
Holy Botox Bret. You ok?
All she did was doge questions
That wasn't an apology, she can't take responsibility for nothing.
When is she going to uphold the laws? Tomorrow?
She doesn’t have a solution for any question
Is the plan in the room with us?
HOW is it ever medically necessary to change your gender?
She wasn't answering a single question and just deflecting and referring to her website. This woman lacks the intelligence and intellect to give a sound answer!
She can’t face tough questions
What an unprofessional interviewer. Don't ask someone a question and then refuse to let them speak.
I know it’s painful to watch this whorebag try to answer a question😂😂😂😂 Word salad x1000😂😂😂
If running away from a question was a person 18:31
How did she pass grade school
Oh is this what an actual Q&A with a democratic candidate sounds like? I forgot it's been so long.
I know it’s painful to watch this whorebag try to answer a question😂😂😂😂
She doesn't want to answer the questions but is trying to run the clock out with a word salad. Brett is being a bit wordy as well and could probably not be campaigning when asking questions.
Why interview someone if you want to own the narrative?
Answer the question
Was she invited up there just to be disrespected? Smh
To answer your question, we've been burdened by the unburden, burden of burdeners who burden us through burden classifications of burdens.
Why does she keep pausing before answering and looking to her right like she is listening to someone in her ear on how to answer said question!?!?!? Gotta love those blue tooth earrings!!
Same earrings as the debate 🤔
If not misunderstood, the very first question was how many illegal immigrants, if estimated, were released into the US during the Biden administration…. I didn’t hear any number at all….how can I vote for the person who can’t even answer a question?
She can NOT answer any question!!
Only 26:00 minutes lol I hear Kamala just can you step down and let Trump run for the last time and you come back to this love. 😂
If there was a wall, we wouldn’t have to spend so much on more officers why would we risk more border patrols lives by not protecting them with a wall?
BRET WHY DIDNT YOU SAY,   THEY WENT INTO OFFICE WITH A SECURE BOARDER
how about those non-racist black-only grants and handouts?
Is she wearing those special earrings to help answer the questions?
This was debate about Kamala Harris herself, but she talked about Trump
It looks like the journalist was the one  grilled .
I made it to 5:21 before needing to shut it off. How far did y’all make it?!
ONLY GOD can get this lady to answer a question?????????
Oh it’s an experiment lol
Just look at her Disgusted facial expressions 🤪 she knows she’s caught up!!! She NEVER answers ANY QUESTIONS… because she doesn’t have ANSWERS! 🤨
She is really good at not answering questions...
If you're going to ask her a question, ALLOW HER TO RESPOND!
It's a yes or no question 😂
I wonder about the ones that are in front of line for legalization. What country's, family's, and class are getting court dates first.
Does she really think she can win by talking about her opponent instead of herself?
She still can’t answer the questions even though someone is communicating with her via the pearl earrings again.  That is why she always  pauses before answering
Critical comment is one thing but pursuing an adversary relentlessly in court and with fbi investigations and so many road blocks to his run for President is not criticism that is war.
He wants an answer…. Not bs explanation
He asked her a question, then did not let her answer it.
does she have a word count to reach?
Bluetooth earrings?
She can't answer anything but Donald Trump,  answer the ducking question
18:23 did anyone hear that?
No accountability.  Do we want that?  That’s a hard NO!!
Never seen someone tap dance around question as much as this idiot🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Why do men never let women finish speaking or is it just this idiot
She is incapable of answering a simple question without blaming Trump she even tried to blame Trump for the last 4 years 😂 she said well Trump was running for president what !
She is so full of crap she can’t answer a simple question at all
Why did you let her skip your first question which was very important.
I hate when people don’t answer questions
When will Trump sit down on MSNBC?
Is this the full interview?
What about the local section 8 offices that have no funding but have funding to put immigrants in. The offices that have been closed over two years!
I still.dont know what she planning on doing to make us safer and bring us a better economy
I just love it when I try to answer a question and my interviewer talks over me in the middle of my answer. Top notch as always dumb fux news.
Has she ever given any good answers? I agree
Great job asking the correct questions the world is waiting to hear from Kamala.
Is the witch wearing her mic-ed earrings?  Just curious!
why doesn't she straight forward answer the question. always deflects. this is what we want for another 4
Can somebody give me the information for Kamala’s dance class? I think I could be a champion if I took her course.
She cannot answer the question!!
I thought laws (like immigration ) were passed in congress...when did it become  the responsibility of the executive branch to "fix immigration"?
Good questions to ask her but he wouldn’t let her answer them before he cut her off. That seems to be a running pattern with these republicans. They like to over talk people so no one can hear the truth coming out the other person’s mouth. And I’m glad she called him out on that half a$$ clip he played too lol
So funny is it me or is she wearing those earrings that she had on the debate? The earpiece 😂.
20.13 lock people up who disagree woth him? You mean like you have been doing with all these nonsense indictments? 😂😂😂 clueless
Hmmm I wonder if kamala has a speaker in her ear?
Why is she so agitated in this interview…
17:25  What are we talking about?
Please answer the questions
Imagine inviting the vice president, asking her a question, and then interrupting her to ask another question literally 5 words into her answer. Over and over again
Lets go Brett , finally someone giving real questions to Kamabla
What about her staff that quit working under her. 🤫
Another “word salad” bar. Couldn’t answer 1 question directly. Evaded every question. How many times did she allude to “Donald Trump…?” If you’re still voting for her, you’re what’s wrong with this country!
“ Brett let’s just get to the point “ continues to not answer the question
Answer one question. Just one time. One freaking time.
Tell me this is not real 😢 she is a clown 🤡 if she is vp anyone can do this this woman is a pathological liar
wow what a jerk he is, why interview someone and not let them speak?
She just badgers instead of answering the question straight forward
Why dont people understand that she is THE VICE PRESIDENT!! It's not her policy, she wasnt making the decisions about the border!! Vice presidents have very little power!! Vice presidents follow the Presidents orders!!
Ask yourself this, would you want this woman to be your supervisor at work?
⛔️Brett was a HORRIFIC interviewer‼️ He asked a question and wouldn’t let her respond when he knew she would speak facts and information contrary to what Fox viewers normally get! SHAMEFUL‼️
What are you turning the page from? Best question ever!
She broke the border and has no clue on how to fix it.
Giving a response is VERY different than giving an answer. And Kamala, he was asking YOU  a question! Donald Trump and I will follow the law aren't proper answers!! I just had a Billy Madison moment. " Everyone is now dumber for having listened to it" May God have mercy on her soul smh
This is just one big filibuster.  If she won't answer a question I guess she knows answering honestly is too difficult or impossible
Is that a smoke alarm chirp @18:23 ?!😂
what are you doing for working people?
I don't even like Harris, but Bret's lines of questioning are so disingenuous, as if he's scraping them from reddit's comment section.
How ridiculous she started most of her answers blaming trump and then just never answered the questions. Lady is the queen of dancing around a question and avoiding the answer
Who cares about iareal?
Btw is Joe Biden still president? Is he doing things, running the country?
What even is this question about surgeries in prison as if that was any of the government‘s business? The government has nothing to do with who gets what surgeries regardless of whether someone is in prison or not? That’s up to their doctors/ insurance provider, the president can’t just go in there and decide that someone they don’t like gets excluded from the normal procedure.
Has yet to answer one question she is standing on diverting hard!!!
Why is a gender reassignment surgery necessary for inmates?
What is your plan
If Trump and republicans thought the first Biden border bill was so bad then why did the Republican majority voted against the latest one that would been the toughest one? Hmm 🤔
This is a bad strategy to try to get a good interview. He asks a question but won't wait for an answer. Really unprofessional. I'm not impressed, Fox News.
Why did she keep bringing up Donald Trump????
Are those the same earrings???
Lie, Blame, Deflect!!! She can't answer a question without blaming President Trump
What the actual F*** did I just watch?
7:17 the question was about the immigration crisis and she went into such a deep word salad she started to talk about how we need more jobs 😂
Didn’t answer question all she does is talk about trump. So annoying to watch
The Democrats administration  .never answer questions.  They can't  say Yes or No ! They always jumble s  up the  questions.  They always blame Trump what is going on now .
Going after ppl who are engaged in peaceful protest? Aren’t you guys the ones who tracked down and locked up the protesters from Jan 6th but didn’t track down or lock anyone up from the BLM riots?
She never answers the question
Boy she REALLY like those earings ayy?
This woman will not answer a question!! She always deflects to Donald Trump
Why don't he let The new improve vice President to ask the question.
Why is she acting like its a debate ? Let the guy finish asking the questions so i can hear it.
Fox News gets grilled on pivotal issues by Kamala Harris
Let me ask you a question and then talk over you when you try to answer it. Terrible interviewer!  Also, we wanted to talk about your policies but let’s talk over you while you try!
Why is she doing this
And here, ladies and gentlemen is expertise in how to not answer a question.
She runs from the question
Can you say filibuster
So why’d they tear down what trump boarder problems
Kamala Harris was asked and not allowed to answer . What does it mean to answer ?  It means that she should have been allowed to talk and explain her point , but the interviewer actually wanted noise because you dont want answers when you dont allow the other to talk . So when you ask a question and you dont allow the other to talk , then there are two possibilities :   1 Either you are not able to understand  or you want to lead the conversation elswhere and not let the other make her point . Such weak questions .
Was she using her real accent in this Interview????
Finally good questions followed by No Answers from kamala
Kamala kept her legs and arms crossed for the entire interview. What does that body language indicate?
Wasn't a directive recently put into place to allow Military to use leth@l force against Americans?
Bret should of gave Kamala the questions to practice like all the other interviews
Border bill? Imported millions of illegal immigrants then told us she did a border bill to block them?
Everyone is like she doesn't answer the question,,, Have you seen Trump every answer a question, that weave is weaving on and one never getting to a point. But the truth is he just rambles like a person with memory loss
Answer the fawking question!!!
"i actually don't what are you talking about?" lol!!
She is never clear.
And why can't she speak about herself?? She can't say squat about herself!
20:30 Peaceful protest?  Like the looting and violence the left has engaged in repeatedly without consequence?
Talks in circles “c’mon you know what I’m talking about”😂😂
How can anyone with a clear conscience not see that she is  completely unhinged?
Trump's plan is to give more tax cuts to the wealthy? His proposals have been things like no taxes on tips, no taxes on car loans, lower tax rates on businesses that source their supply chains in the US... That's hardly a list of handouts to the 1%.
This Woman CAN NOT ANSWER a Question!!!!! She just wants to make this a political pitch!!! SHE IS A JOKE!!!!!!
This chick is CRAZY!!!!! Just answer the question?
This woman is a idioso...she deflects questions and doesn't answer or take accountability
Has she EVER had even 1 good idea or thought of her own?
Notice how she didn’t whine or run away when she was given tough questions
Huh… why then did the Biden administration authorize the military to use deadly force against the American people in our homeland- BEFORE this interview ever happened??? HMMMM!  Actually Madame Vice President, we have more and more concerns of your administration stripping us of our constitutional rights then any other entity…
4 minutes in, and she can't give a straight answer to a question.
Why are you asking questions if your not gonna listen to the answer. What a dumass interviewer. Might as well just monologue 😂
I heard there was an award, of some sort, to anyone who could identify which question she answered, responsive to what was actually asked.
She can’t answer a single question.
Quick question, why would America have to support Israel, and even consider it as the “most important things”?
When is Trump going for an CNn interview 🥹
Donald Trump was ALREADY PRESIDENT. Did he ruin the country then? Why would he ruin the country now? You're going to lose.
Do you think the NRA and gun lobbyists owe these families an apology?
He is asking the question and you do not hear an answer but just propaganda .
Kamala has got plans for America? But she did not have any plan for America the past 3,5 years except her WOKE agenda, except defunding the police, except allowing more and more illegal aliens to come into America like killers, drugsdealers, rapists.
And people are actually going to vote for her?
Does this woman ever answer a Question Let’s be honest she hates even being asked Questions and her Brain only knows how to say it’s Trumps fault she has no backbone a Complete Puppet
good god. why ask questions if you're going to interrupt someone answering them?!?!?!?
Why does she always sound on the verge of crying when she doesnt cackle?
Where is the rest of Kamala interview FoX  American people deserve to know
Shes perfect! Can't answer a question! Got that down!!
Turn the page on rhetoric? 😂 The Dems are the worst at it!
What is Bret Baier doing?
She still refuses to answer the simple questions 🤔
Lets be clear how is this a interview when this bonehead did not let her answer a question? Fck trump and the maga i would never vote for a person that cant put two words together or lies, this is why i vote blue. All you suckers are just blind..
Bret - congratulations for asking her very simple questions that were too "difficult" for someone with her lack of experience to answer......
What penalties?
Fox thought she would stumble into the bs trump crap they live for, asking questions but trying to keep her from giving a full answer, the fox way. I love how she cut into Brett, and they thought she’d fold or walk off like the orange guy
Anyone anyone at all watching this interview and listening to her talk about the reviews of her plan. Somebody please tell me any element of the plan anything at all anything at all. And not just a a headline the details of the plan how it will work who it will affect who will impact the most who will help if it will hurt anybody else what it will cost the taxpayers!? All of those things anything at all just one just
Why doesn't he let her answer a single question
Doocy would have asked harder questions.
How did tump dismissed them as headaches? Is he in charge of that decision?😊
I don't understand how she has no ability to answer a straight question.  I'd fire her first day.
I didn't hear a single answer that actually counted as an answer.
So fox CAN ask questions! I thought this was going to be like when they interview trump where "what is your perfect sunday?" Is a normal question.
She sucks! She refuses to answer the questions asked and then says "let me finish!", when he tries to get her to answer.
This guy's the only one who asked a question
How can we trust her with Putin and Ayatollah when she can't even do a simple interview. She's weak.
This guy would fail both Journalism 101 and Broadcast 101. Ask a question and then talk over the person so they can't answer the question. Seemed like he was looking for answers to fit a pre-determined point of view (gotcha!) rather than conducting a true interview. Lousy journalism.
I'm sure people on both sides of the aisle are getting very tired of every time a difficult question is asked they try to deflect it and blame Trump. The people want good ideas nobody cares what side of the isle it coming from
Why would you call someone for an interview and then not let them speak and answer the questions you ask?
Also, why does she keep saying we as president?  Fraudian slip?? Is someone else presidenting with her?
Legend has it she is still avoiding giving a number
60 seconds in and I'm already fed up. It could be cnn asking trump a question and him not answering the question and I'd feel the same
This is a new SNL skit right?
This interview was a joke.  Yes, he asked the question but, he did not allow her to fully answer the question.  When she started saying something that didn’t fit what he felt like was the right answer.  He would cut her off.  He is not a good interviewer.  He wants to debate.
Does she even know how to answer any question she is asked? Apparently not 😒
Penalties for illegal crossings? Flying them around the country and setting them up with housing doesn’t seem like much of a penalty.
Would the murderers have gotten into the country anyway? I guess we'll never know. But Trump's lackeys and worshippers sure seem to know the answer to a question that's impossible to answer.
Finally someone is challenging her! 🎉
She couldn't answer a question directly to save her life!!
Pardon my English, what does "clear" mean?
He’s giving sufficient time to respond but she’s making a word salad and NOT answering the questions.
Please list out the names for those 16 laureated economists who support you.
Same earrings as debate hmmmm whos feeding her
She wasnt grilled? Nothing was ate
12:28 I wonder how much government money she spent on fake rallies and paid actors😅
I wondering why the USA is losing all its political relevance worldwide… is this their VICE PRESIDENT!?!?!? Oh boy…😮
In fact, does vice president have power to decide the any polices?
If he would've let her answer a single question, it would've been a great interview.
Finally some hardball questions though
She avoids every single question because she knows  nobody would vote for her if she gave an honest answer.
She turned an interview into a debate.
After 3.5 years she found the border???
“I’m obviously not Joe Biden and I’m not Donald trump”..no one said you were dummy lol how about answer a question forth right for a change.
She still never answers any question just talks like someone with brain damage she such a liarer
Why doesn't she just admit they want an open border?
She make no sense and doesn’t answer a question
How many direct questions can one person avoid answering?
U could tell she had talking points and he caught her off guard with questions so she tried to change the conversation to what she had memorized. Those aren’t her answers
I still think those are bluetooth earrings
I get that any candidate may dodge a question or two. But good grief. I just wanted her to answer at least one of his questions. I don’t think she gave a single answer for anything other than Donald Trump is a bad man!
Locking people up who disagree?  Like Jan 6ers that only walked into the Capitol and walked out?
2:14 whats wrong with he neck ...it looks like skin is folded back along the sides and stapled down????😮
She don't how to answer questions and can't say anything smart I love this she also got served on the original 60 minutes
She never answers the question that is asked lol
Her manner of speaking let her skips answers to questions
Let me ask y’all a question. Do you guys believe a word this clown says?
Why did Bret approach this interview as a debate? Seems because Trump lost his debate with Harris, Baier felt a need to do what Trump couldn't--win a debate.
why bother asking questions
Is she dumb or just stupid? I just need one answer.
She never answered the question..hahahaha, useless
She is the worst! Can’t answer a single question.
Can someone go back and see just how many times she said Trump’s name?
Lmfao, every question she was asked she refused to answer and then reverted  back to just attacking Trump
how can anyone take talking in circles as an answer to a question and know that she has done nothing in 4 years. The buck stops here Kamala, own your failure.
How do you go through a whole interview and not answer anything? 😂
This interview is so annoying. You can't ask questions and not let the person answer. You're not even trying to keep her on point. You just like the sound of your voice. Plus he's so disrespectful. This is not how fox need normally conducts interviews. Smh!
Did anyone notice she is wearing those earrings again? The ones that look like those bluetooth earrings? I mean, if I were accused of wearing earrings that could be Bluetooth earrings, I’d put the ones that look like any Bluetooth earrings in a box for the rest of my campaign.
The kind of interview we needed. True question the American ppl wanted and fact check
Bret needs to shut up and allow her to answer his question. Trump would lay down and have a toddler tantrum if he was treated like that. lol
She did not answer one single question. Just changed the subject every time
she struggles to find words to basic questions.....
Why do I just not believe anything she says 🤷‍♀️
did she actually answer any one question? blah blah blah all politico talk. Never actually answering anything.
Hey Brett, nice try mate with all the attempted "Gotcha" questions but she wiped the floor with you and your questions. Kamala made mince meat out of you.
She didn’t answer one question straight forward
This lady cannot answer any question that is asked.
She just cannot answer a question.  Let me just finish not answering the question....   Enough is enough, how can Anyone think 4 more years of this crap is right.  Her ignorance is pure insanity.
Thank you Brett, for the courage to ask real questions.  Please continue doing your job and be a good example to your co workers.
This woman is wholly incapable of answering the FOOKIN QUESTION
Why she didn't do all these things being a VP? Either she was a failure as a VP or she is lying.
Why did he let her get away with not answering why she removed remain in Mexico. We are done if she gets in
I can’t get passed the Face lift! This was a waste of everyone’s time! Questions are loaded and answers are just vague!
Refused to directly answer a single direct question beginning with the first asking how many illegal aliens she has let into the country
She litterally didn’t answer one question…
60 million to Ukraine? For our border bill?
She answered 1 question....i think.  😅
you'll never see the left ask her any questions like these in depth with follow up questions. Good job Bret!
Who’s tired of rhetoric?…..  and who is tired of inflated prices, unnecessary wars, and open borders woke bs etc?
Does she ever answer a single question
A chart with the questions and her answers to the specific  questions would have been awesome. She didn't answer a single question!
What about the American experience?
Only Iran? What's about China? Not on her list? What's that mean? Is it mean that she will open door and welcome China after got elect?  Just like her party did many years ago
WHAT EXACTLY DID SHE DO AGAIN FOR THE LAST THREE AND ALMOST FOUR YEARS.
12:24 not a big issue!? 🤦‍♂️ she's sooooo warped 😅
Let me be clear, I am not used to tough questions
She couldn't even answer the first question. Straight to gaslighting and word salad until you forgot what you asked
Why is the actual interview the 20th result on Youtube search?
Why didn't Biden Harris keep Trump's border policies intact until they came up with a new policy
Immediately you can tell how adolescent she is by getting snookered for not answering the question and having not her way she can’t handle pressure thing for herself. She’s terrible.
Omg she is a master at dodging the question but she's getting weak.
Were those polls taken from only 690 something ppl?
Does she know what she is talking about?
Why does he keep pushing her about Biden? Biden is not running for another term. I think Harris did a great job.
Do they forget that Trump stopped the law to detain undocumented immigrants in Congress?
That woman can hold up under a tough grilling!  Why did Trump block the border bill? It's a real question that deserves a real answer. Why? Ask it again.  Why? Nobody ever makes him accountable for his actions.  Where are the thousands of children separated from their parents and bused all over the country?  Where?  Where are the children?  Did his Epstein buddies traffic them?  Did he apologize to the families whose children were stolen from them?  Did he apologize to the families whose children died alone in cages?
Why do so many of your staff quit Kamala if your such a great choice???
She just keeps dancing around her wrong doings and still has not answered any questions clearly!
Every single question he asks of her, she points at Donald Trump instead of answering the question directly.
How many times did she mention Trump’s name?
Started off with a real question and quickly deteriorated to nothing of use. I also wonder who did the survey where most Americans think we're on the wrong track. I noticed there wasn't a reference. I think it's most likely something Fox made up.
why did you cut the sound ???
please ask her to show the people her right ear
She cannot answer a single question! If she actually did, people would know that she is totally Communist.
Avoided every question 🤦‍♂️
First question, and she can’t even give a number.  Still don’t know why anyone would want this administration to remain in power 😡
Thanks Fox, real question and as we know now it's not her fault its Trump ok 😂 I follow the law but you make the law how bad is this😜
Where our taxpayers dollars go is not significant?  REALLY?
Turns the page,that's my favorite question😍
Finally, a reporter who isnt tossing softball questions and putting up with non-answers.
Didn’t she call Trump supporters Weird?
Awe - Bless her heart! Sah cant talk about her policies because she doesnt know them, someone put onto her webiste - did she read them yet?
She is so stupid she can't even deflect a question
Question 1: No Answer Question 2: No Answer Question 3: No Answer Question 4: No Answer I see a trend here.....
Unhinged much…..???
Why does she always sound like she has had a few drinks
Can she handle criticism?
Can he stop interrupting?  Or does he believe he has a right to talk over her because she is a woman.
Who should I vote for??
Why is it that left-wing, ultra-liberal politicians are just as ignorant and evasive in Hungary as they are in the USA? Go Trump, Go Orbán!
I lost brain cells hearing her try to answer questions. I don't want four years of this.
LOL Horse face wasn't expecting to be asked some real questions and expected to answer and not just obfuscate
I love the part where Bret wouldn't shut up and let her answer the question.
She answered questions quiet well as Bret was great in his Job by allowing her more time to speak
She wanted him to ask what flavor ice-cream taste the best what hamburgers taste better
She is really good at dancing around questions
Instead of answering the question she just say the question in a different way. No answers for anything.
Fox try do a got u question she handled him like a leader. It’s republicans faults bc they didn’t borders bills for political purposes. Republicans are big lies
OMG she is the Side-Step a question Queen..!!!!
Where is she getting these fantasy accusations from?  She needs som psychotropic medication.
Obama could have picked a better puppet. Did his wife say no?
Yeah, the interview is the ask questions and you answer it!
Should’ve asked her about the accents
Was Kamala really a District Attorney in California?  She can't even answer direct questions
Wouldn't expect anything less from Fox News. Asks a question (that was fielded from Twitter) and then interrupts Harris before she can fully answer it. Sets up the Fox pundits to complain that she didn't answer a single question. Even without interruptions, this interview was more indicative of her leadership than it was substantive. She's willing to go on Fox whereas Trump just canceled his appearance at next week's NRA event in Savannah. But let's just focus on the fact that her answers lack brevity.
Thanks,Brett For asking the question that is the key for whoever wants to be the leader of this great nation unfortunately, as always, she didn’t go on the point and nobody’s understand what she’s saying I’m sure people don’t be fool with her alibi and are gonna figure out who is going to make a America great again.
She goes in circles until you forget the question that was asked… 🙄
Do the national security advisors support the number of people that have come across the border? The same ones that say trump is unfit?
While Trump was in Office we had George Floyd etc because DT wanted to keep the cops unaliving human beings these questions are unreal
is this Dilma from brazil?
Kamala got cooked with simple questions
Why does she keep passing the buck.
She composes an elite anti of the the ability to never answer a question 🤣🤣 she’s a lost cause. Such a joke she can never just admit she sucks at her job
Moderator: VP Harris can you tell the American people your favorite color?   Harris: Donald Trump hates the color green!
Why can’t these men be respectful? From Brett interrupting her as soon as she starts to answer, to tRump sexually assaulting women and mocking disabled people, and I could go on ! Why, why ?
What is with these clowns always asking about what a vice president has done while in office???  Please, tell me, how many vice presidents have EVER done ANYTHING of substance while in office....
How is this real
She couldn’t answer correctly without him cutting her off!! & he’s looking at her with disgust!! Is this is ok?
I love how he talks over her when she starts dancing around the question but not answering it or somehow blames trump
5 minutes in and she can’t/won’t answer a yes or no question of “do you ah e rgtets about how the border has been handled?”  🙄🤦🏼‍♂️
Waiting for her to answer a single question, lots of word salad and bait switch!
The Question On Everyone's Mind..... How to end government corruption & sends the power brokers packing?...“THE INSANITY ENDS” WHEN VOTERS VETO and RECALL POWERS BEGINS!....Control Law-Makers and the Oligarchs are History!
that's a GREAT question.... WHYYYYYY are 50% supporting evil?!!!!   How is she supposed to answer that.  Ya'll tell us!
Question 1  Answer Donald Trump on going  Question 1000  Answer Donald Trump
How did Americans come to this in the same place...
She doesn’t demean people? Trump does? Why did she call 18-24 yr olds dumb?
How.many people think she couldn't and hasn't read those 80 pages? 👇👇👇
Do I dislike this video because she’s so bad or do I like it because they showed how bad she really is?
Does Kamala care enough to know any of her policies or does she have some staffer make up a bunch of talking points on her website.
What kind of biased questions are these?
No Madame VP, you were not answering the question.
God do her voters listen to these interviews!?
oh my god, the very first question cant be answered?? that was the point she needs to get to, what is the number?
Did she answer any questions?
He should have called her out on the McDonald’s lie  Why didn’t he? 🤦🏼
She flunked like so many knew she would. Thank goodness someone decided to ask her real questions and show her lies.
Brett, great job! The dumbest Kamalies twisting the question! Brett, is too later for her to follow the Law! Don’t worry about Trump!
I’m glad he asked why she concealed Biden’s mental decline, because she didn’t have a reason or even a good lie, she did it because she was told.
WHAT IS A $25K  DOWN PAYMENT GONNA DO TO A $400 K   HOUSE?
How can people vote for her
Such a run around responses to the questions without actually answering the questions...
How long will we tolerate this.
Turn to new page from what?  Good question …. She is in office for last 3.5 yrs, not enough time for her to turn a page ?  Funny 😂
Crazy how he literally asks her how they are going to change things after the past four years and she still just blames Trump
She does NOT want to answer the question (because she failed her position as to preventing the immigrant invasion).
Question: Can you give any answer without saying Donald Trump?
Makes me cringe watching her answer questions.
this should be a CLEAR RED FLAG…  SHE can’t HANDLE this. real questions… straight to the point… no one is eating out her hand…. she CANT DO IT.
It’s always a rare delight to watch a democrat have to answer direct questions rather than hand picked soft balls.
WHY ARE THEY STILL TALKING ABOUT JOE BIDEN WHEN HE STEPPED DOWN?? It’s so stupid. It’s like ADMITTING you don’t have a point to stand on.
Clown. Never answers the question
How much did they spend on her ads during Sunday football on fox
She won't answer..runs around the question. As usual.
Is this interview about her or trump ? The obsession is actually scary now.
she was absolutely battered here with questions, she couldn't handle it that well from lack of preparation and too much soft questioning... but she can come back from this. it's a lesson more than anything but it didn't paint her great. it's good we had such strong questions in the opposite direction of everything we've had so far for Kamala but it's sad every interview has to be political. these questions are only strong because they come from the right, rhetorical, less about suitability to the american people's real lives in many cases.
What has she done that’s good for America over the past four years? Name one thing. Anyone?
Did she answer just 1 question? 27 min for 1 answer? This is sad.
Brett: *asks question* Kamala: "Well, Brett, here's what I think," Brett: "Madam Vice President, let me just jump in here."
Blowjob is not answering the questions
"Why did you invite these illegal immigrants to the U.S. offering them free healthcare our own citizens don't have?"  That would've been my first question.
Does she ever answer an ACTUAL question
Why is she continuously yelling at you? Sad to see this from someone that is running for the highest position of the land and she’s so combative 😳😳😳😳
How did she pivot from advocating for transgender surgeries in prison to strengthening the economy?
First question was terrible. It's a question you can easily look up statistics for, you don't need a presidential candidate for it.
He keeps cutting her off does he have adhd. Like fast talking is not going to solve his ignorance as a reporter
More support at the border? Wasn't Gov. Abbot of Texas that sent the National Guard to the border because the federal government wasn't helping?
Did her staff not get the memo after the debate that people were skeptical of those earrings? If she wanted to prove she could ad lib she would have worn something else.
Unlike Trump she didn’t shy away from any questions from what I see.
IS SHE EVER GONNA JUST ANSWER A QUESTION?!!
Can she answer a question without beating around the bush?
How many more tragic cases are we going to have before someone does something about protecting our border.
Playing political games with the issue? She literally came out with a post the other day saying recreational marijuana use shouldn't be criminalized when her previous work as a DA in California says something otherwise. Had she acknowledged her track record and admitted fault and a change of view, people would understand it better. But that to me is playing political games. Lying to the American public so blatantly.
If Trump is so dangerous why are we on the brink of WWIII??
Skip and dodge questions like she always do
THIS WOMAN CANNOT ANSWER ONE F*CKIN QUESTION!!    She is a complete joke!!!!
Answer the questions!!!!
why are the American people his  enemy?  Seems to me it is teh obama and biden harris adminstration that is his enemey ... and probably a lot more in WA that when he gets into office hopefully we will find out why
Not a single sincere world … what doe’s she really think? Does anyone can tell?
I want to know if I will have a nice lawn? I don't ask for much, but I was wondering since I'm not in jail and have my own insurance, can she subsidize me so I can pay my landscaper? I  am middle class and deserve to have a really nice lawn, as do my neighbors so when people pass our home the will be in awe of our middleclass nice green lawns! UGH!
Why is it? That every single time a democrat is pressed by facts, they jump to labels and playing victim?
She enters a question just like Obama they go on and on and on and on to make you forget what the question was and work their way around not answering it directly Sounds smart Actually you're dumb Is the concept
This woman deflects alot answer the fkin question!
Who’s gonna pay for it!!!
What is the medical necessity of a man in prison "transitioning"? Stop the clown show.
She try to interrupt his reporter question, let him speak and then do answers
Come on Bret...you as the questions...give her time to answer.
Why not do all the things she’s proposing now? Because she won’t. Trump 2024
Can you believe you go to an interview, where you get the chance to show who you are and present the case why people should vote for you. but all you do is blame your opponent and then at the end tell people to go to your website to find out what you are all about? How is this even possible
One comment for her for loophole she said the immigration system has always been broken, but then how in her administration seems to have broken it 10 times worse that’s what she’s not addressing that’s what she’s gaslighting on. That’s the question she’s dancing around that’s the question that goes in one year out the other. That’s the part where she takes no responsibility and then points her finger in every direction taking no accountability. It’s a shame someone with her background, legal and political. She has absolutely zero accountability so much so she insist on dodging the question with the topic changes. Imagine her trying to do this in a courtroom. Imagine she is a defendant understand when you ask the direct question you’re not allowed to change the topic and dance around questions like this we need to hold our politicians to that same standard legally, with their right hand on the Bible and hold them in the contempt, when they misled and dance around and skate around the questions
Queen of deflection who can never answer a direct question. God help us! I cannot stand her condescending and obnoxious personality. Such a pandering and vacuous phony with no substance. No wonder ninety percent of her staff quit!
Trump guy here…can we admit that she destroyed any agenda Bret had?  She’s masterful
Why is this reporter not letting her answer?
Why can't she answer one question without blaming Donald Trump?
Can’t answer a single question
Did anyone else hear that smoke detector beep? Was this interview done at Kamala’s house or…?? 😂
Kamala answers questions like I would trying to get out of a traffic ticket.
Where are our body language analyst?
Is everything I say going to be deleted
none of the question to her were answered
Why the Kamala-Biden administration would want more border agents if they’re being asked not to detain, but assist ilegal immigrants to cross the border and to get help?…why?
If you had a nickel for every question that she answered directly . . . you wouldn't have any nickels.
80 pages of policies. That you can't name?
Guys…what’s a scorge?
Does she even know where America is on the map?  🤣
Dude is an idiot. How do you ask a question and then keep interrupting someone answering. I’m not even a Kamala fan but you’re very insecure to do that.
What plan????????? This monster will eat us alive
Without mentioning Donald Trump or citing him as a reason, why does one support Kamala, even after interviews like this? Whether the right or left conducts the interview doesn't matter with her.
12:19 how much was that pearl necklace
Kamala wouldn't let Bret control her. What's up with that???
What a C U Next Tuesday! Gets nasty when she can’t answer a question…
What a sh*t job this Journalist did...ask the question, let her answer, we know who he's voting for clearly.??? What a joke
Brett asking all the right questions!!!!! Notice her voice changes. Annoying af!
ahe is answering each question with a tone that seems to show she is asking herself if she herself believes what she says
Who exactly did she “prosecute?”
This woman still could not directly answer a straight question  if her life depends on it!
She just wont answer a question
She can't handle real questions
Anyone noticed she only wears those earrings when she’s doing interviews and speaking events?
Her voice is annoying. Why is she whining?
Should have asked her how many drinks she’d had before this
Interview was 26 mins only?
US Citizens are sick and tired of politicians talking in circles trying to make excuses for problems…we have simple questions…”how many immigrants have been released into the US”…that is the question…answer it!  Is that acceptable? Is it sustainable?  How much is it costing us?  These are all really simple questions that can be answered easily but Politicians often do want to answer to the Citizens and often try to minimize the horrific downside of the allowing immigrants.  Putting a single Immigrants safety in front of a single US citizen should be punishable by law…if the system can’t regulate immigrants to allow in a manner that does not put citizens rights at risk then our government should not allow any immigrants until they can put American Citizens first.
Typical of her and the people who agree with her she can't even like answer the question without getting into some long diatribe that mostly doesn't even make sense and she insists on talking over him to make sure that what she's got to say is heard even if it has absolutely nothing to do with the question
video played good until asked about Joe Biden then it started loading eve 1 min in ....very interesting
Kamala fell apart, only thing on her mind rent free is trump. The question is what are YOU gonna do? Especially since YOU have been in office for the last 3 years.
Really bad interviewer from Fox. If you have a question please be prepared to listen and not interrupt.
That was an exercise in how long she could filibuster and not give any substantive answers
As always, she can't answer a question.  I'm glad she was treated in the same manner as when the left wingnut mainstream media channels ask Trump questions.  As always, just a word turd sandwich of crap.
Finally!! Someone asked the OBVIOUS question!!!
Why do they trust him more than they trust you??????hmmmmmmmm?????
She does know that a decade means 10 years - right?  And that of 10 years, Trump was only in office 4 - and the dems were there before him and after him?  And then speak about pointing fingers at each other while she is pointing fingers at Trump?
How did she pass the bar?!? How did she actually become Californians AG??? The reason she was picked is she is degenerate puppet who doesn't mind spewing out nonsense.
who you lift up ? who you choose to lift up ?
Anyone else notice when she gets upset the demon face manifestation?! 😂
What a clown still hasn’t answered the question like always
Thank you Bret Baier for asking these questions.
Really hard to support anyone, regardless of party affiliation, who can’t just answer the question. Such a painful waste of time to watch these clowns.
She's got a brain worm?
what the hell is this Bret Baier guy thinking? HE KEEPS INTERRUPTING HER whenever she starts to answer a question!! Lmao of course she can barely answer; he's hardly giving her the chance!
Is this Estee Palti? If so she is totally brilliant. Harris is an idiot and not a happy one.
How sad. He never allows her to answer the question. Also, what disrespect!!
Grilled???😂😂😂 Fox and Bier got his a$& whoppped and handed to him
One can’t ask a question and when the answer given isn’t what you’d want to hear speak over the answerer. I didn’t hear a question he didn’t talk over. Good for her for not dodging any questions and not losing her composure or getting angry or flustered.
This lady cannot answer a question if it hit her in the face! How can anyone with a conscience vote for her???
Bret should of ask her why she had meetings with Fanny Willis
Are backwards
Does she think we've forgotten that Israel attacked Iran first when they bombed their Embassy in Damascus in April.
Why does this woman say so many words but say nothing!!!!!!! 😢
Are they tryna fix the economy or just make it worse so trump has trouble like jeez please do your job woman
Is this Bret's first time doing an interview? Whats the point of having a guest on if you just keep talking over them lol
What, a 20 mins interview? And a 800 pages handbook??
Bret was asking the classic “when did you stop beating your wife” type questions. He was obviously trying to please Trump and his Fox colleagues who have been critical of him.
What are the penalties for crossing the border, free resources to encourage more illegal immigration
Im just so tired of hearing Trump name , can they both do interviews without using their names.
Mahalo for asking the hard questions and pushing back on her nonsense responses
Funny, she never answered the question on Biden
Did she lost her black accent?
So when did you stop beating your wife? Yes or no please answer directly or I’ll move to the next question and talk over you while you are trying to explain.
She sounds like 🤔 “maranda” the character with the red lipstick…? 🫣
She cannot answer a question honestly. I will not vote for.
She is terrible and can't answer a question
Ask her a question and she deflects
Where’s the Jamaican accent⁉️😂
I can’t believe what she did with the first question she didn’t even wanna answer that
Do you think JD Vance had a watch party ?
who is paying for your ads ?? Ads must cost teh same for you as they do him unless you are getting free ads then one must ask if that is election interference ?
How come they’re in all these interviews she’s wearing the same pair of earrings?….. anyone else find that odd
How are you supposed to hear her policies if you won’t stop interrupting her whenever she makes sense? So irritating
Are you going to vote for a woman who flat out lies? She knew Biden was unfit
She dodged every single question, of course
Thank you Brett, for being a real journalist and asking questions!!!
Why not ler her finish what shes saying? Shes here. If you're confident shes going to say something stupid, let her say it.
Did she answer a single question?
Does she only have one pair of earrings?
Why does no one talk about how that border bill wouldn't stop the flow? It would only release them into the country faster. I'm sick of them using that as a pass for undoing policies that worked
Frig i wish i were the ppl that get paid to advertise commercials...20 million for a 20 sec ad?  Im in the wrong business...
Oh for goodness sake....answer the darn question!! Take responsibility for your actions!! You're a liar, Kamala! You called the wall a Vanity Trump Wall!!
Does Kamela have only one pair of earring. Seems every clip of her, she is wearing the same earrings.
Sooo why were y'all suing Texas?
Right from the start with the long slow answers that actually dont answr the question ...
She couldn't even answer the first question 😂
Anyone else notice that she's wearing her special earrings again? Does she not know that we know that she knows those are fake earrings.
Why does Fox and all the Trumpets blame Kamala for Biden’s doing? A Vice President is basically a figurehead that ‘supports’ POTUS.
this was so cringe. quit up talking. quit asking to speak. answer one question asked. shes pathetic.
Senior enlisted versus junior officers
Is she gonna cry?
Is she raised in a middle class family?
2:30 So why haven't you started doing all this? You've literally been 2nd in command for the past 3 ½ years. You're just spitting out words that you think people want to hear. You're a liar and as real as a Chinese Rolex. 😂
You are in prison not club med !! Follow the law ? Isn’t there a law that you cannot enter the US illegally? What law do you follow Kamala ?
The point.  Is how many!!! answer the question ffs !!
Why she keeps bringing trump??
She never answers questions!
Sometimes I have a hard time trying to understand what the vice president is saying, I had to scroll back to the question a couple of times
If I behaved like this and "answered" questions like this during a job interview I would never get the job.
I’m 3 minutes in. Does he allow her to give her a single answer without interrupting her?
How anyone can watch this and still support her is beyond me.
Doesn't she realize that the economy was better when trump was in office?
Why is it so hard to watch the interview without pausing to take a break from the cringe?
Names trump to many times for me ,,,JUST ANSWER QUESTION ,without mentioning TRUMP😂
Wow… just wow, after being asked point blank do you own them and apology and she says oh that’s so sad I’m sorry for them, then blows it off by saying let’s talk about this over here instead. 6:00 - 7:10
Thank you for asking these questions! I just wish she could have answered them without talking in circles and wasting time!
Brett’s an idiot. Asked her a question and literally interrupted her within 4 seconds. Bro shut up. You’re trying to argue with one of the smartest women in the country lol
If they claim to give every family who needs a home a $25,000 down payment, how will they afford this? They struggled to give families in Hawaii and hurricane devastated areas $750 with 0 physical support from any alphabet agency.
Who was that masked man?
How can you pay for more border control when you were giving that money to Iran at the beginning of the administration.
What right did Trump have to involve himself in the boarders bill… he doesn’t even hold an office….and his secret phone calls with putin… treason
The way you know you're on the losing side of the conversation is asking a question and not giving someone the chance to answer. Classic narcissistic verbal bullying because you actually dont care to hear the answer, you simply think you're proving some big point. This "journalist" should leave the journalism to professionals who know how to let someone (even their opposition) answer a question. That's why we let Donald Duck ramble.....the idiocy will tell on itself!
Are you all ready to be unburdened by the burdening of this burdensome, "raised in the middle class" has-been?
Can someone please do a Trump count to see how many times she mentions him
Great job Fox on simply asking REAL questions.
She is just ranting and ranting and not answering questions. The host is very polite. I would have told her to shut up and answer the question
If they did all that then why is our government giving the illegal immigrated incentives to come here.
Why do they never bring up the fact one reason the border bill was denied was because the Democrats added to the bill that Ukraine would receive 4.5 billion dollars in aid.
Baier should offer an apology on the way he would ask a question but not let her answer. She even called him out on it and he'd just proceed giving the answer he wanted to hear.
He likes to throw out questions that he doesn't want answer's to, this was an interview for Kamala not an interview for him to showcase his Journalism skill's or lack of.  Journalist who take on high profile people, need to shut up after there question's and allow a proper answer, but he's only allowing her an inch, which makes him look like an A$$ Journalist...
Where is Biden in all this?
Will she answer a freaking question!!!!!!!!!! She does not answer questions.
word salad.......   she'll go down with that name like Dan Quayle and Potatoe.  On one side she had nothing to do with running the country and the next she worked with all these people in the war room and with congress.   which one? hmmmmm    how about asking her about all the staff she fired?  Simple question.  If people can't work with you or around you.. you can't lead.
Literally a bunch of questions no one cares about. & how could she answer if he cut off everything she said.  KAMALA HELD IT DOWN!
Did not answer one question. What a clown show
So Trump has more power in congress who is no longer the President than President Biden and Vice President Harris has to pass a bill?
She can’t answer a question…our enemies would love for her to win…the world already think we’re weak…not only would she be crushed if she wins…our country, our citizens will be crushed….
She can't answer questions?
So what made Joe Biden go crazy ?
Why does she have the exact same ugly, huge pearl earrings on in the debate, in the 60 Minutes interview and in this interview?  This intelligent woman this she has a receptor in her ear with someone telling her exactly what to say.
In this case when you don’t get a straight answer just refresh the question example. How many immigrants released? answer A. 1 million B. 3 million C. 6 million what is your answer?
Nothing is very clear please enlighten us
She can’t answer anything. What is wrong with her?
2:46 did she just call him the wrong name??
Answer the F’ing question K!!!  Maybe We the Voters don’t want to hear you finish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Some piece of work Girl!  Have no idea who you are talking about….
How is it possible that this lady was a prosecutor or at least obtained a lawyer's certificate? Something is very wrong here.
Is he interviewing her or himself? he wouldn't let her finish a sentence. Is this suppose to be normal LMAO
If Kamala Harris ever gave a response that specifically answered the question that was asked the world would stop spinning on its axis for the shock.
I wanted to know if the Lebanese ‘aid’ was part of a payoff deal with Iran to stop them from attacking Israel.
So if she’s not gonna have a mad deportation when she get in office, how is she going to get rid of all these illegal immigrants?
the interviewer was trying to turn it into a debate. wish he wouldn't interrupt
She answers nothing
She can’t answer a single question. She is used dog water. We need better leadership!!
Is this an interview or argument? She argues with every question instead of answering, almost like she has no answers
Is former vice president never thought of he'd be up and running for president again either I'm sure he's nervous about his political career as well for obvious reasons
Anybody else get physically sick listening to her?
Who voted this lady in?Oh that's right nobody
She can't even answer a question. How can she possibly be in charge of anything?
She is not capable of answering a single question.
She tried to Filibuster every question…..
Her response to every question was to refuse to answer it. Instead of giving an answer she would obfuscate and filibuster. When Brett would try to bring back on point, she would talk over him. Her responses to his questions usually consisted of a word salad containing unsubstantiated claims about her record  and yes but Trump is bad!
i wonder if she knows if shes a woman or NOT!
Didnt her administration start 3 wars?
Answer the question!!!!!!!
If Biden was so sound of mind then why did 2 new wars erupt during his presidency?
Answer the question, stop lying!
She NEVER answered a question 🤦‍♀️
If trump is or was unstable then why were there no wars during his presidency?
Did she ever answer the question? What’s the number?
RIGHT EAR YOU KNOW WHAT THERE IS ? :D
E very  answer to a question is Donald Trump...
Nobody can speak for three minutes answering a question and not say a thing.  Kamala: hold my beer.
Does she have an accent for each interview?
How do Trump supporters refuse to understand that Trump killed the bipartisan border bill. They tried to fix the problem they keep bringing up, but he would rather run saying there are issues, instead of fixing it when they can.
I thought it was supposed to be an interview, not a debate.
Are there people that would vote for more of this crap? Really people? Really?
Jesus will she just answer a question
She sucks and never answers a question. I think she is responsible for everything and she bypasses answers and blames others except herself. She is the biggest bully, fake, she lies.
She really has a gift at stringing together long sentences that are devoid of any meaning. She is an expert at filibustering questions with word salads. It doesn't sound good but she just strings off syllable after syllable without missing a beat lol.
how about why did you stop building the wall?
why does it always come back to their opponent? why not answer questions directly?
Guadalajara cartel hasn’t existed since the 80’s when exactly did she go after them??
How about an interviewer make her take those fake pearls off her ears so we can see how she would deal on her own .
So did she ever answer how many illegal immigrants they let it?
Do you trust someone who has ran a good economy or do you trust someone who has run a failing economy?
If she could just answer the question and not give the campaigning speech, she just can't seem to answer the hard line questions without a teleprompter.
A child reporter with ADHD?
Why is she yelling at Brett? Shes big mad cause she didnt think it was going to go down like it did. Also, does she ever wear different earrings during interviews etc?
When has a Trump interview on Fox been only 26 minutes!! What? Are they afraid that she might get through to some viewers.
Fish out of water
I wonder how much "They" paid him, under the table?
Does he have a real face? It looks like he had many jobs done in this area...
Interviewer: What are you going to do? Harris: Trump Interviewer: What are your proposals? Harris: Trump Interviewer: How will you change things? Harris: Trump Interviewer: What type of dressing do you put on your word salad? Harris: Trump
God stop answer questions for christ sake.
Kind of hard to interview somebody when after you ask a question you never stop talking long enough for them to answer. 🤡
if she knows about gan gs so much, why allow 13,000 convicted criminals 16,000 convicted r3p ists for a total of nearly half a million CONVICTED criminals!!! She is so dangerous for this country.
Can anyone here tell me Trump‘s policies? Not as talking points his policies I’ve been looking everywhere and I can’t find them. Or should I read Project 2025 to find them?
Did she answer any question?
So why did he not ask her if that water bill was so important? Why didn't you pass a clean water bill? Why did you stuff it full of pork for Israel and Ukraine? Instead, he let her filibuster.
Come on lady, no word salad, just answer the question.
WHAT ABOUT OREGON GIVING “NON AMERICAN “ 30,000.00 to help in getting their FIRST HOME ?
He asked questions and then talked over her. She crushed it🎉
Why can’t she just answer questions direct. She’s always dancing 💃 around everything. It doesn’t take 10 mins to answer a simple question.
Why is it so satisfying to see Kamala crash and burn whenever anything approaching a serious question is being asked? BTW, anyone know how many times she brought up Trump?
I really wonder why everything is SO clear to her but NOT to me
Has anyone noticed Kamala wears less makeup than Trump? lol
I’m looking forward to the interviewer who will not move to the next question until the first question has been answered…even if that means only one question was asked.
Interviewer: What’s the number of illegal immigrants your administration has let into the country? *Kamala avoids answering question and gives long response* Interviewer: “Can you give us a number” And she freaking responds “let’s get to the point” and then doesn’t give a number still?? Him reasking the original question was him trying to get to the point. Can’t stand these politicians. They are so insulting to our intelligence.
Are y’all ok with the fact that Trump won’t disavow political violence. You’d think after an assassination attempt he’d stop talking like that but he can’t help himself.
Policies or goals? Because in order for it to be policy, it has to have a plan and a way forward... I don't think someone with your lack of experience can deliver such promises. If so, prove me wrong and EXPLAIN HOW!
If he or she can handle a tough interview, how can he or she take on a tough 'world'?
She never answers ,what was those things then to tighten it up say it then.
Simple yes or no questions and she keeps dodging them all... kaliar harris kaliar
The real question is: Are you capable of the human feeling of regret and remorse, Madam Prosecutor?
Good questions. She needs to answer the questions directly,  own the mistakes of this administration, and explain the adjustments. Still a much better choice than tRump as I will most likely be incarcerated for being a lib. Vote Blue for the good of everyone.
I don’t understand why she dances around the question instead of directly answering. If you believe in something, stand on that.
This was so hard to watch, 26 minutes and zero questions answered.
Fun fact what was January 6th and was the military not supposed to be involved and calming down the American people?
"Wrong Track" poll literally asked 652 people LOL!!!!!  Fake news
No you can't finish talking Lady Answer the question .
Even her “earrings” didn’t get her through this interview…. Total incompetence and unable to directly answer a simple question 🙄😡
is anyone seriously going to vote for this Lady?
Wish she would just answer the question!!!!!
Watching this reminded me of the doctor interrogation scene from “A Few Good Men”..🤔
Is this the full interview?
Answer the question and quit turning it on Donald Trump.
These are loaded questions aimed to make Harris look bad. This is far from an interview, but an interrogation.
Let her answer the questions.
whose cackling now Kamala?
Was she expecting an interview or just another staged trump bashing?
Can Donald Trump make this many coherent sentences? Just wondering. Sound off in the replies
She is not answering single questions
So flustered under any kind of pressure starts stuttering and interrupting would we really like to send someone like her to reason with Putin or any other world leader. The United States are not pushovers
Did k harris meet with b netenyahu ?
If his “plan” is to give tax cuts to billionaires then why are all the billionaires funding her? I am confused.
Let's talk about avoiding answering a question..
Answer the freaking question
She still not being honest and not answering the questions.
how is anyone even indulging this waste of space?
We are 20 days out from the election why now why do you do the interviews now
Why the hell did FOX allow her to wear her ear piece earrings?
This is her time to shine & questions are being asked like what have you done & what are you doing to fix the current issues madam Harris? And she keeps bringing up Donald Trump. Trump hasn't been the Vice President for the last 3.5 years! Honey, we clearly know what Donald Trump is doing; dodging bullets, fighting cases, & running for Presidential office. What are you doing besides blaming Trump??!
Was this his first interview?
I think she only answered 1 question 🤔
All these plans are cool and all but there is two active wars being fought. Whats the plan with that? I don’t see why Ukraine gets our support like they do. And the Middle East is bigger situation than any one of us, it feels like something needs to give there.
My only qualm with this interview is that he didn’t let her speak, he would ask a question, when she started to answer he would in interject or interrupt before she could explain her answer. From my point of view it seemed as if he was looking for his next argument, a spot to call her out instead of listening to what she has to say.
Ask her how she got her previous positions please 🛋 👠 😂😂
Keep pressing about the democrats covering up for Biden for the past four years
i cant understand why he wont let her answer questions
Is she secretly talking about herself instead of Donald Trump? Because everything that she is saying about him I see in her.
4 mins in....and she refused to answer the first question and still hasn't answered after 4mins....
why is it that left wing politicians never accept responsibility for anything they do?  It was clearly a mistake, take responsibility!  and why is it that left wing politicians always put the blame on someone else? congress, previous administration, anyone else...
I think she literally managed to not answer any question posed to her.
Has anyone ever considered the reason people think the country is on the wrong track is because the division created by Donald Trump running his Putin filled mouth since 2011 beginning the birther movement, the culture wars, the name calling, the lying, lying, lying, and more lying?
Wonder why her pager didn't go off a few weeks ago...???
Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump and still not answering the QUESTION.
Thank you for finally asking the hard questions!
She never answers a question she's such an idiot it's so frustrating to watch her.....
Why Hasnt She Disclosed The Amount
Omg this woman can’t answer a simple question, EVER. Just try to pass the buck ..please GOD she cannot be in charge of our country. Anyone would be better, anyone!!
8 minutes of you hounding her on what the Biden admin did 3 years ago rather than the plan she has when she is President.
Why wasn't she asked about the billions Biden gave Iran 2 years back, this was the USA funding their enemy and who strengthens their foe before going to war with them.
Is this an AI generated long form Trump ad? No? Its real? Wow…
Notice how the interviewer asks a 200+ words long question and then interrupts Kamala before she even had the opportunity to answer for half that.  If the interviewer can set the framing with a long question, then Kamala should be given the opportunity to set her own framing with a long answer.
This dude wasn't trying to condan interview! He started interrupting her after he asked his very first question 😂!
Her strategy is to talk so long speaking nonsense that you forget what the question was in the first place without having to answer
Lock them up??  Really is that why his rallies are so packed with people!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
What’s the ad and cost have anything to do with the question? Her spending and ads are insanely more ads and more money.
Like usual she avoided the question
She can't even answer the simple question. HE ASKS FOR A NUMBER, GIVE YOUR BEST ESTIMATE!!!!!! It's annoying how they dance over the question and go on the most useless tangents ever. Word Salad Kamala fr  Edit: she won't even let Bret ask questions or add to them, the less questiosn she has to answer, the better she will do. I'm just getting so annoyed with the fact that she dances around the questions.
Like most politicians… she can’t even answer the questions. 😂😂😂😂😂
Why she did she not noticed Biden declining health right away?  Why does she not want to talk about it?  She made herself look not smart by not questioning Biden's health for so long. 😊
Why is she talking so slow?
She knows how to talk around a question like working a wiener
The American people wanted Joe Biden, not you?!?
So she has all theses plans…. Why doesn’t she explain any of them?!!😂 Trump 2024
So, why is she on the ballot?? And not Joe Biden?!?
Did I really hear her say “you have to take responsibility for what you do in your administration”?
His follow up question at 9:24 was masterful. She should have just tapped out right there
She wants a conversation, but it can only be 20 minutes, and her answers take 5 minutes and still didn’t answer the question
This is like listening to a sociopath. You ask a yes or no question and she goes a paragraph on on about donald trump. She is so annoying listening to I cant wait to see the end.
she danced around every question blaming someone lese does not show good leadership
Peaceful protest??? What riots was she watching???
She is so good at dodging questions and talking about nothing
This was overly biased questions
She dodges questions.  She is not to be trusted!
I can’t even finish watching this!! She’s a liar!! Never answers the question!! She makes me sick
Wow.  What did I just watch??
It would have been nice if answered a question
Kamala's ways of answering a question without answering the question:  - Vague buzzwords/buzzphrases - I will follow the law - I've done this XYZ thing in the past that circumvents the question - Pretending to empathize
Thats not an interview . It's an interrogation .
FINALLY SOME REAL QUESTIONS THAT SHE STILL CANT ANSWER
those earrings are suspect. 😂
She had a pretty good strategy going into this, which was: answer every question with a rambling 5 minute response, that you only get asked 5 questions.
Just answer the question, she never answers the question with legitimate answers, she says anything and everything but what was asked
Funny how she never answers the question and still says “let me finish” and says more word salad
Why would you want wealthy people who have more money than the countries debt but liquidated be on the same playing field as middle class people they will eat all of us alive as we see already
If she so strong why did she refuse more debates?
FINALLY! Great interview questions. And still Donald Trumps fault 🙄🙄
This doubtful VP is absolutely pathetic.
2:19 Can I finish not answering your question?
I’ll give her one thing, she’s very confident not answer questions and saying a lot of pointless words😂
It seems that she was sabotaging President Biden for over 3,5 years?
Bret every question to this lack of a candidate, showed her true classless bully lame responses!!  Thank you for enduring this painful loser!!
I swear she is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!! WORD SALAD!!!!! She dodges the question I wish Bret would have went back and said is THAT A YES OR NO!?!?
Did she answer any question?
Hows it that Kamala Harris got "grilled"? is it only because the interviewer interrupted every 5 seconds? interesting.
This wasn’t an interview. It was a series of questions looking for gotcha moments to help elect the IRL adult version of Joffrey Baratheon as your king. I hope the trolls in the comments are just that and they don’t actually believe Trump is good for America.
Joe Biden was the experiment!
He asked great questions,  but gave her a little too much time to campaign against Trump
I want to know if trump was better off inheriting President Obama's economy or Bush's economy? Y'all remember the mess he cleaned up after Bush in 2009 and economy  rebound he handed over to Trump??? What did Trump leave his successor??? He left a massive deficit and welfare to farmers AKA Subsidy and tax cuts to the rich. Dont forget the clown he was on the international stage as well.
What's with the disrespect?
If you watch all the Trump interviews - He gets grilled every time ! She can’t handle it? Is she really ready?
She keeps deflecting and not answering the questions. Vote MAGA!
About time they ask some real questions & followup when she deflects!
Quit interrupting her  Brett! Let her finish dancing around the answers to your questions with her idiotic word salad!!!
No way this is a President profile !! Where is her CV ???
Unclear
He asked a serious question and dodged it and he finally got annoyed and said 6 million!! She said I was going to answer
Why go on Fox? What does she gain? This is 2024 she could go on a YouTube, streaming, or podcast channel and hit a better audience.
Did she give a number to the first question? Lol
She only dances around questions! No straight answer……
Is she mentally ill or something?
I will say all the times Donald Trump has complained about being interrupted and yet they're doing it here to the vice president in the middle of her giving an answer and then saying she's not answering the question but she doesn't flat out answer the question. She likes to tell stories that's her communication style
A whole lot of Deflection
Is there really no democratics in the comments lol i haven't watched the video yet but i dont see anyone saying she did a good job lol 🤣 oh my
Why did she decide not to answer the question and then said “let me finish”?
What is wrong with her? She’s a mess. God help us if this gets into office
Could she be more arrogant or condescending??
So many leading questions.  But, hey, not surprising.
I wonder how much she spends on one ad.
She not answering is she crazy
Never in my life have I seen someone be asked specific, clear questions, and just doge and weave every single time to avoid giving a straight answer.
You are not clear. At all.
That was it? THAT was the campaign ending catastrophe? The Disaster? The Great Implosion? After watching Biden and Trump flail about in interviews I'm feeling oddly disappointed at how OK she did.
Is she acoustic?
She avoided/dodged giving straight and clear answers to each and every question, blaming -sometimes bordering in the ridicule- Donald Trump, what a sorry candidate!
This is so hard to watch. How is it possible that she cannot just answer a question without all the word salad.  I will follow the law and it is Trump's fault....
She literally isn't answering anything
A broken immigration system? Who the hell broke it ? Stop deflecting and take RESPONSIBILITY brain dead freak!!
She won't answer the questions
Ask her a question about Joe Biden. 30 seconds later still flips it into talking about Trump.
@12:37 what are these plans! Why not question her to go deeper into explaining her plans. That’s what the American people want to know!
Does she know what we want?
She is soooooo bad. She Cannot answer questions.
Reporter: Madame Vice President.....how old are you? Kamala: It's Trump's fault I don't have an age.
She's incapable of actually answering a question. It drives me insane.
What does she have to offer, other than talking trash about Trump?
Normally you’re suppose to let a person speak when asking a question even if it’s not the answer you were looking for
I wounder if it's Obama in her ear or Hillary?
She can’t answer one question
Did her nose just get longer about the border??
Not one single answer to the questions.
The first to do when she won it’s take this unprofessional, rude and nasty man and send him to go back the school to understand when we make a question we wait to the other person provide with the answer before interrupting.
Can she say anything that isn’t a lie?
You dont answer the question you go around it so you wont answer it and bleme othaers
She did a great job. He's asking the questions, and he's also answering them 😂
nice bluetooth earrings Answer the question for the love of god
Is that the only set of earrings she owns?
she is literally never clear
Is it so hard to take ownership and responsibility of your poor governance over the past four years? I could respect her more if she would say I messed up, I’ve learned and it won’t happen again.
The weave?? Seriously, DJT
I didn't hear her answer one question
I wish someone would ask her about her earings
Point out when she answers a question. Then begs to finish nothing she was saying. It’s a skill only Satan himself can word salad into your fault, we would have already fixed all this! Trump Trump Trump! Interrupting cow. 5:36 Worst candidate and VP candidate in American history.
Where the heck does she think all this money is coming from?!?!?!!! HEY LADY!! FROM US, THE TAX PAYERS!!!😡😡😡
No one can get this woman to answer a question clearly and concisely.
How does a 60-yr-old not have any idea how to pronounce “gouge” & now “scourge?” She’s so dumb!!!!
So what is she for?
WOW she really does not know how to answer questions
What a disaster.  This woman tried to filibuster her way through every question.
She cannot answer questions that you asked her. Wasting time!
Wait a second she's dropped her accent. Where did it go?
What's with all the makeup.  I thought women wore makeup. He looks like his ol'lady blush fell on him.
She soooo upset bc off the question's
Why does my body recoil every time I hear her speak?? Why can I LITERALLY not watch her interview bc it makes me cringe every 3 seconds
There are no questions about women issues 😂😂😂 Fox being foxy 😂😂😂 Questions to Trump are like How many holes you made in golf 😂😂😂
she can't answer a single question without deflecting to Trump
Most people answer the question and THEN elaborate. Not elaborate and avoid answering the questions
"What are you talking about?"🤣
Why can't VP Harris ANSWER a question?? It's all deflection!
How come people don't believe her when hearing this?
Riddle me this: why does the left constantly talk about the rich “paying their fair share”, but never about those receiving government handouts and benefits DOING their fair share? Wouldn’t that also help reduce the deficit AND make our country more productive??   Just a thought 🤯🧐
Any one count how many ‘let me just finish’ deployments that was?
22:07 questions about what you witnessed while at work  if your boss was unhealthy for office   Answer Donald Trump lmao
Why in the hell does she respond like a demented alcoholic kamala
Why didn’t trump fix the border when he had a red congress???????
Every response started with 1,000 filler words. And then she gets annoyed when he chimes in and starts saying, “will you let me finish the answer”. And then she doesn’t even answer the question. She stinks.
Last 10 years? Obama was President 10 years ago.
Did she answer a single?
Not the usual “soft” interview given to Trump…and she still handled it🤔…looks a lil’ “hacky” with all the loaded questions too😬
Harris actually answers pertinent questions (or attempts to between interruptions) rather than slurring narrow braindead streams of thought while dancing onstage 😆
I may not know everything, but the need to increase housing - wouldn't that be caused by the millions that have crossed the border? According to Clinton, our birth rates are down, so new housing wouldn't be so needed.
5 hours later….😂still no answer
She’ll never answer a question, only deflect and blame Trump for her shortcomings
After watching this interview I have to ask how could anyone support this clown? Please answer
A real interview...nonscripted questions. Wow...of course she bombed it
Why doesn't the Senate vote on H.R. 2?
is this an interview or a debate? this host really likes to interrupt!
Trump gets asked a question, turns it around to point fingers at Biden/Harris. Harris gets asked a question, turns around and points fingers at Trump. Neither of these people can take responsibility for their own actions and policies.
Does anyone know whether she has prosecuted trans-national criminals?
I hate Faux Neus - will not let anyone answer the questions they ask… always interrupting to get their PROPAGANDA POINTS ACROSS.
You aint answered but a single question yet
ask her how many rioters she got bonded out!
How can anyone be voting for Kamala?   Why is this even close?
Why not she goes back to her previous career? She compare everything to court cases
Side stepped every question.
ask her how many crimenals she flew into our country to get more voters!
She's mentally broke. Can somebody please call the doctor for her?
Is everyone else on the edge of their seat? 😅
Lots of plans being offered.  How will they be paid for?
What the plan she keeps talking about? Im still waiting to hear steps . plan plan plan that's tall she says.
Is this an interview?
Bret is terrible. He doesn’t even know how to be quiet and let her answer a question.
2:08 it was actually his turn to talk she just didnt want to answer his question
How does more border portal officers help if the borders are open anyway? Whats the point?
He is so rude! Not allowing her to answer the question just interrupts her each time.
she loves to side track every question!
Trump would have an autism attack if he was asked questions this tough 😂. The party of “facts over feelings” really is full of snowflakes
Why do you need a judge and a trail to stop illegal immigrates when you can just not allow them to come-in at the first place?
SIMPLE QUESTION HOW MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN RELEASED!!??? Simple question WHAT # KAMALA!!?  🇺🇸 WISCONSIN FOR TRUMP🇺🇸❤️🤍💙💪🏼💙🤍❤️
She ducked every question 😂
Ugh why didn’t he talk about the Ukraine money in the border bill 😠
She cannot give a decent answer to any question !   She is so full of herself? Keeps going back to attack Trump & not answer any question asked?  😡😡😡😡😡😡
Everyone take notice that she CANNOT answer a single question without bringing up Donald Trump!!!! Instead of talking about what she is going to do she keeps bringing up Trump.
Good job fox!!! Finally someone asked her hard questions and put pressure on 😂 and we all seen how she deals with it
Kamala Harris please answer the question! We don’t need your lecture!!! We’re not stupid like you.!
Broken immigration system? If the current laws are enforced there would be no problem.
She is not answering each question with a truthful honest evident answer!! 🤦‍♀️
First five minutes and can’t answer the question . SCAMALA. We will not be able to handle that Karen energy for 4 years. Give us FACTS AND NUMBERS
How many fkn acts did she pass recklessly!
Alright, someone give me a critique on Kamala’s policies and why trump is better as an alternative that don’t just boil down to “I don’t like brown people.
Why would Fox produces cut the interview why wouldn't they just keep going????
This really wasn’t an interview. It was mostly gotcha questions which, if were answered directly, would provide a half-assed view of the issues they were discussing. When the interviewer didn’t get the answer he wanted, he would answer it for her or move on.
It’s literally impossible to watch, she cannot, and I mean CANNOT answer a question.
Did she answer any of his questions?
How did she get to where she is today??
Finally...some real emotion...still didn't answer the questions tho
What a joke! ANSWER THE QUESTION!!!
4:23 - isn't that five democrats?
I had to go to the comments to see if she answered the first question.. I've still yet to hear one.
Can she ever any a question??? stop talking in circles!!!
Omg let her finish the answer you question back to back but you dint have a chance to let her answer your first question .. cuz you know why… don’t like the truth.. please don’t interrupt again ..
She cant and did not answer one question asked of her. So many words but saying absolutely nothing.
Kudos to Bret, he asked follow up questions but she wasn’t giving the answers required!!! We see through it all.
This is basically how the interview went:  Bret- What is your favorite color? Kamala- Well, Donald Trump hates the color yellow.
11:41  she says every in the clip, then says only medical when responding… so what is it?
I bought my house 8 yard ago at 25 years old, can I get 25k? What do I get for working and paying taxes and buying a house?
WHY was she not laughing?!!
Why does she always wear those same earrings all the time 🤔 Maybe because they're earbuds lol
She doesn't respond answer the question she goes off the question
She never answered one question.
In a democracy, where does it say that anyone has the right to take life away.
She didn't answer a single question. I wish he would have blatantly told her she is deliberately avoiding answering. Just to call her out.  She did awful. AWFUL!
I have never seen anyone so disrespectful before. The interviewer asked a question of would never let her answer it in full. He kept talking over her and disrespecting all of her answers. He didn't want to hear the truth that's the end of that! Very rude!
What about BLM?😊
Why is her voice so whiny……
She keep walking around the question
That was annoying. I felt like she would never answer the question!
Brett did a great job asking questions. She had no answers.
Harris can’t answer a straight question!!! Blame others for her mistakes!!!! Rattle on with no explanation
Ha! Any of you Republicans out there feel like shes on your side? Do you feel like shes lifting you up? I sure dont.
Finally, someone has the courage to make the right questions, not where she washed her greens, which I doubt it, since she was raised by a scientist mom, who was a University faculty member, with a not a  very middle class salary.
she is not answering any question lol😂😂
She deflects and avoids the question. She’s running this country like a defense attorney
So she couldn't name any one of her policies that's from her website? 😂
Still has no true answers
So if donald trump had the ability to sway the senate why would he need to be president. Seems like a problem with the Senate and not with Donald Trump if it's true
Hmmm guess if it’s a major issue republicans shouldn’t have voted down the bill twice.
How many questions did she answer?
Question...if he couldnt run/oversee his own University successfully...making sure students learned what they needed...why should I believe he is looking out for whats best for us regular people other than making his business friends more wealthy?
That was painful to listen to. She deflected every tough question without answering it.
This 🐖 NEVER answers a question
Is anyone surprised she can’t answer a question. Where the puppet masters so we can get real answers.
She’s offering small business and first time home buyers money. Trumps offering no taxes on overtime and no taxes on tips…. Hhmmm do you want a loan? Or do you want your money that you worked for so you can buy your own house? That’s pretty much the split.
Finally real questions on policy but like an AI machine no policy answers but to blame Trump on their policies of running the country and she wants to keep running those horrific policies as the first woman of color which does what for us?  Nothing.
Define middle class household?? 😏
Wow, was that a disaster.   She went from almost crying to overheated anger.  Why?  Because she had to answer a question?
She does realize Trump isn't the current president right??🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️😂😂😂
Well, Brett she answers your questions  like she engages in fixing a problem.  It ends up going nowhere.  ❤
Seeing her avoid answering every single question, I bet she was amazing at dodgeball as a child.
The questions I didn't really care for it because they wasn't talking about he wasn't really talking about issues but my whole thing is I don't like how he wouldn't let her answer he won't let her speak just been born on her with questions then when she tried to answer one question something else Saturday so it looks like she's never it looks like she never had to answer for anything because he's constantly bombarding her with questions
Great job Brent.  You stayed on point with important questions that have not been asked and followed up when needed to try to get answers that were difficult to address for someone who has been in the belly of the beast for the past 4 years
Can she answer a question?
Why did they let her do that? Wow
She tries to bulldoze the whole interview to not answer the question!!! Mind you.. they showed up late and reduced the interview to 15 to 20 minutes. TRUMP IS OUT HERE DODGING BULLETS AND SHES OUT HERE DODGING QUESTIONS AND LETTING US KNOW SHE WAS RAISED IN A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY.
Peaceful protests like the BLM riots??
REAL MSM journalists DO still exist!! Thank you Brett for asking the tough questions, pressing her to answer and now allowing the garbage deflect and run answers! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I'm just hearing a whole lot of fluff and logical fallacy words, meant to deter the interviewer and audience from the question and hopefully forget what was even asked in the first place. Can she for once just answer a yes/no question with a yes/no answer. 😒
When pressed, she blames Trump. Trump has nothing to do with this. It is a Harris/Biden problem.
Iran… you mean the place that accelerated their nuclear program after Trump destroyed the deal that was keeping them in check? I’ve noticed a trend of him blowing up deals with the promise of a beautiful new plan that never comes making the issue worse. Let’s not also forget Trump assassinated Iran’s top military general in Iraq which has had us close to war with them ever since.
When I tell Republicans I am on the fence still, they ask questions, when I tell dems this, they lose their minds and stomp off.
This woman does not know how to answer a direct question at ALL. Good Job Bret trying to get this VP to be held accountable. She has no clue what she is doing & saying. it's all the same thing over & over & over again.  I'm so over this!! lol..
17:52 projecting much?
Why didn’t she answer any question?
Same questions, same non answers, same lines she has been fed since day 1.
"What's the number?"  "Brett, let's just get to the point."  Sorry folks, she's an idiot.
Would you let me finish?! -  Kamala Harris
Is she trying to read his questions before he asks them?
How did she even get to this position? Only in America boys 😂 Scandinavia is laughing at this circus u call American politics
Again like the debate everything but just talking interruption after interruption
I wonder if you hold up a cross in front of her , would she hiss and run like a demon 😈????
11:03 but why? Ot don't make sense
What is this? The slaughter of jar jar binks😂😂😂
That Dingbat didn't answer one question she was asked.
But we still don’t know what’s in her so called plans.  🫤🙄🤨
Did he ask her any questions about the her plan for the economy or healthcare or gun control?
She dodges every question and don't answer them . Pathetic
Thank you, Brett, for having the cajones to ask the hard questions, and the attempt to nail Harris down on any kind of real answers. What she DIDN"T say says a lot.
"Let me be clear", "Let me finish", "I'm spreading", "Can I finish"  You're not saying anything, not answering direct question and whinging about being pressed to stay on point and give task answers.  But by all means, continue to waste America's time.
She’s always ducking and dodging and gawking and cackling at the immigration questions….
Why does every election feel like deciding which leg do I saw off?
She isn’t looking at him.  Is she reading a teleprompter?
Oh My Goodness! She can’t even answer the question!!!! She takes her answer around the barn a few times and then aimed to come in the back door and still NEVER answers the question.😂😂😂😂😂
OMG KAMALA REALLY YOU BLAME PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR ALL YOUR FAILURES. CAN YOU ANSWER 1 QUESTION AND LEAVE TRUMP OUT OF IT. JUST ANSWER YES LETS GET TO THE POINT
Whoa! What a total frauds is! She ran from every question and din't answer a one!
So using her words in an ad about taxpayers paying transitions for criminals is misleading? And basically she said even though he didn't have any done under his administration. She's saying it's in law so she would follow that law! Listen closely people.
Bret: here’s the question  Kamala: let me finish repeating my narrative
She can’t answer a single question…. What a joke. She is a puppet.
It’s about time she had to face a few difficult questions!
yes kamala we know you get it first from willie brown & now from doug, so would you like to tell us who is better at anal?
Listen, I know this is off topic, but what the hell is going on with Brett's face? He looks like the love child of Liberace and a cat.
Yikes…. she literally doesn’t know how to answer a single question with a straight answer. It’s bizarre!
How come she didn't go on to have an interview with Maria bartiromo or Sean hannity, it would have been like Minnie Mouse going up against Mike Tyson.😭
Could Brett deepthroat the orange popsicle any further?
😂She can't even answer the question?
She always try’s to flip the questions on Donald trump like everything the past 4 years he was president or something like no YOU HAVE BEEN VICE PRESIDENT FOR 4 YEARS TAKE RESPORESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS WE CAR ABOUT YOUR ACTIONS idgaf what Donald trump “said” i care about ACTION NOT WORDS.
That was beautiful. A spin doctor asking impossible questions and a politician giving non answers. Peak psyop.
I just clicked on the video and shes already avoiding answering the question not even 20 seconds
It was good to see journalists ask the questions we all want to hear.
Does anyone have a tally on how many times she blamed Trump in order to avoid answering the question?
Why can't she answer one question? All she does is jump back to Donald Trump... her IQ level lacks
Why is he talking more than the person being interviewed? Respectfully… that’s not how it’s done.
"I'm in the middle of responding to your point, are you going to let me finish"   "Yes ma'am"    Keep it on a good show but truly he knows his place
This country is in bigger trouble than ever? What have or will you do better or different than the person you keep talking about VP Harris? 😢😮Praying for her!
Wow, not a word from BB on abortion, I wonder why, LOL!
If everything is Trumps fault then how do we trust her the next 4 years because it seems like she doesn’t have control over anything and Trump has all control?!
She didn’t answer a single yes or no question with a yes or no answer. She’s either refusing to be honest or incompetent.
There's always a but with her!
She can’t even answer one simple question, ridiculous 🤦‍♀️ Blaming Trump isn’t helping your cause nobody in their right mind would ever want her to be a president 🤢🤮
She has no policies. Can't answer the most simple question. I do believe the Democrats made a mistake pushing her. They actually got caught up in their lies. Thanks Brett Bair for bringing her out of her comfort zone . Still she can't answer. Vote Red.
Love how they try to disqualify this interview when trump get the same questions if not worst
From the first question... 200% gaslighting. She dances around each and every question, and not only don't  they get answered directly, but she wastes time hoping the topic will be changed.
What's the plan? I don't hear the answer and she just threw the rainbow gang right under the bus!
Does kamala forget about Benghazi or Afghanistan withdrawal? Both under the dems watch?
What is with these men talking over her it’s out of control
Question for the Trump supporters: If Harris had said something like "look, we had a bad border policy, and we messed up, and now I want to fix, because we realize how big of an issue it is" instead of beating her way around it, would that be better or worse?
IVE NEVER HEARD SOMEONE TALK SO MUCH YET SAY NOTHING SMH.... HOW CAN ANYONE EVEN CONSIDER VOTING FOR THIS WOMAN?????
Bret is asking great questions. Holding her to the fire to answer the questions. Finally! Thank you Bret for asking good questions.
How will pay for it
She is an absolute train wreck!! Time and time again  she cant even answer the question asked by anyone!  Brett did an awesome job trying to get an answer!! TRUMP all the way!!
So far the only thing she does is no straight answer. She is probably doing it on purpose so time will fly and she will not have time to answer more questions that will show how bad she will be IF she wins this election.
She can’t even answer one simple question, ridiculous 🤦‍♀️ Blaming Trump isn’t helping your cause
Why is this goin on? Donald Trump Why are you not doing your job for the people’s benefit? Donald Trump Why are you delirious? Donald Trump Why aren’t people happy with your leadership? Donald Trump Now we know
Just answer the question dude
Where does Brett Baier gets his NUMBERS from? If 70% of the population says the U.S. is on the wrong track, why is the presidential race almost neck and neck? At least 62% of the population think Roe v. Wade should NOT have been overturned. So obviously numbers don't mean anything.
How can she answer the questions when you keep interrupting her.
Wow, will you ever answer a question without making excuses and not taking blame for all this time you and Joe have done nothing??????
What kind of interview it is?, just try to blame them (Biden/Harris) the bad thing happen, when is well know Trump is a criminal who plays with the rules and if he is running again to avoid being in jail.
This lady never answers what is asked, she always makes a word search.
Why is her voice going to high and airy. It sounds like she is whining.
Could you please share your preferred candidate for the upcoming election? Your input will help us gain valuable insights into the potential outcomes.
These questions re stupid tho 😂😂😂😂
Wouldn’t even let her answer the question on immigration…
she avoids answering the question directly and goes straight to some Trump insulting    she doesn't answer the question she skirts around it
She got a lot of YES/NO questions, but never answered YES/NO.
Ayo German here 🇩🇪 I don’t get why as an American you’d vote for Kamala she just doesn’t seem to be qualified to become president why would the democrats even nominate her ??
Oh I love the beginning, stopping her waffling on whilst avoiding the issue, good for him, God she cant answer a question she can only waffle, she seems think this is a campaign speech, yeah she has been to the border as a campaign stunt but before that where was she. Fecking cheek, saying he hoped for a conversation when all she did was lecture.
Where can I read her plan?
This was a debate, not an interview. Kamala schooled him.
You're the one that can't take criticism or even answer a question.
Aren’t you trying to lock up trump for disagreeing with you 😂
All it takes is one interview where a journalist is asking honest, spur of the moment questions, and all of her BS gets exposed.
So far the only thing she does is no straight answer. She is probably doing it on purpose so time will fly and she will not have time to answer more questions that will show how bad she will be IF she wins this election.
didn't even answer the first question
He should have waited for her to finish her lengthy response… then asked her same question again regarding those numbers to highlight the non answer
11:45 does this apply to you too Kamala?
Anybody hear the smoke alarm at 18:22? 😂
Yeah, she was raised in middle class family and would like to solve all the issues, but how?
I threw up watching this. She was asked a question and answer is totally irrelevant
18:25 what happened to her voice? It suddenly dwindled down? Lol like clearly, she doesn't know how to answer for her shortcoming/absence during the past 3 1/2 years they've been in office.
Why is this guy so disrespectful
So this is what journalism looks like. Ask a question and if they avoid it, come back to it. She is a trainwreck. I'm in power but orange man bad (that's not in office) is really in charge for the last 3.5 years? hmmmm
Wearing the same earrings as she did in 2019 that were debunked as blue tooth earrings. Are they really not the same instagram earrings?
She's a joke and can't answer 1 question direct.
Did she walk out crying? If so how can she deal with the heads of other countries!!
Thank you for actually asking real questions and being so professional!
But can she explain the policies on her website? I doubt it.
All non answers
Really didn’t want to just let her speak huh? So many times in this interview he asked a question and started to cut her off after one word 🤦‍♂️
How people can vote for her is beyond me
She replies so slow to her point on purpose that makes the interviewer lose patience and skip the question to a next one to make her escape the proper answer
Can anyone tell me why Kommiela Harris has only one pair of earrings? Look at every interview or debate, it is always the same earrings!
Question? “Tell me a number of how many illegal immigrants you think have crossed the border”  She can’t even give a number. What a joke.
Brett let’s get to the point! But will not own the number of undocumented aliens they let into this country… won’t answer a question! Brett is the easiest host on Fox News. He’s easy and fair and this person won’t answer!!!
well they both talked over each other, I think it was generally healthy discourse?
She's truly an idiot! Answer a question directly for Pete's Sake already!!!
How is this not the first result when I search "Kamala harris fox interview"? Google is meddling again....
ask her about locking people up from Jan 6th
Does she know how long a decade actually is?  Out of a decade, we've had 6 years of democratic leadership.  Im getting nothing of any relevance from her responses
Did she answer any question????
Does she not understand how to answer a question? All she does is run around the question and keep bringing up Trump even when asked about Biden. How stupid is she?
Do people actually believe her lies?.
Omg, I'm supposed to vote for her?  I changed my mind, Trump has my vote.
She NEVER answers the question
Can she answer any questions directly? She reflected almost everything! 😅
Brett did such a great job interviewing her and trying to get her to give a clear answer to his questions, yet all she gave was word salad. But to be fair, Trump does the same thing when asked a direct question and only gives a word salad answer
Why ask someone a question if you’re just going to interrupt them while they answer? This is why I have a hard time with Fox News
She never answers the questions and it’s always going back to Donald Trump did and what Donald Trump said and she never says what she’s done or what she plans
Can she take responsibility for anything?
Anywhere i can watch the whole interview?
Was there a real straight forward answer in this interview? Didnt see one.
Wouldn’t let her speak what kind of nonsense is this Biden and Kamala are different ppl don’t ask questions you don’t won’t answered that’s why I have a problem with Fox News
She didn’t answer one question, pathetic attempt at an interview from Kamala. How on Earth people vote for this bumbling buffoon who can’t even form a sentence properly is beyond my understanding.
Answer the question don't make campaign speeches. I'd re ask the question for 25 minutes and at the end I'd be like "AND STILL NO ANSWER"
She takes way too long to answer the question and does not give specific answers so she does not know anything obviously. If she would give direct answer he would allow her to go on longer in the answer but since she does not know he doesn't.
What a great question,   what are you turning the page from ?
Who is beating down who?
Support Federal Law can trump do that?
How long have they been trying to lock Donald Trump up now for disagreeing with the Democratic Party?
How to end your career in less than 30 minutes...
How much did you spend on some twirp, twerking on a stage?
What kind of an interview is this? I’m lost.
Anyone else clear on any of her policies? The only thing I know is her feelings about Trump.....
Didnt they just give NG permission to use lethal force against americans?
Answer the Fking Question!!!
No accountability and can’t answer straight forward question
Why Is Kamala able to talk herself out of American concerns, and turn all her statements into emotional inspirational sentences, and generalizations  of hope, there’s no conclusion to anything she says?
Do we have a list of names of the large number of men who have been released in this country and committed heinous crimes? There should be a list it there is a record of arrest or charges.
Kamala belongs in football with the way she was sidestepping those questions.
Donald Trump does run on problems often. Didn't regulate eg shadow banning for 4 years asking for 8 years.
so tell  us the plan cause we don't know what the plan is because you don't have one it is just words and lord knows your good at that!
How did she get where she is?She has the mind of a ten year old
Why are we not talking about the the unaccompanied minors that have gone missing and are now being human trafficked!
Good job, Brett.  Good questions, good interviewing style.  Well done.
These are questions most Americans have wanted to hear her answer for a long time.
Can she answer a question?
He never lets Kamala Harris answer . What is this?
Chips and Science act? What is this?
She’s a moron, can’t answer one question.
She didn’t answer any of the question yikes
Terrible interviewer! He should ask the question and shut up.. Looked like an idiot.
Lady, it's a yes or no question. We want to know your opinions. Cuz laws can change.
What question did she actually answer here
WHITE Fox privilege didn't want her to answer the question. Why? Afraid of the truth
Where's the CNN fact checkers? Kamala needs them!
Asking someone a question and then immediately talking over them is not a good interview. So disrespectful. But ya know ABC does the same to Trump so I guess no one cares.
Saying you’re sorry for her loss is not the same as apologizing, and you refuse to do that apparently Kamala
Is she finish class English second language???????Looks like she fail!!!!She don't understand anything ......
No answer on how to fix anything
What the f did I just watch?! lmaooo
Do we have a list of names of the large number of men who have been released in this country and committed heinous crimes? There should be a list it there is a record of arrest or charges.
Next question, when are we getting Gavin Newsom out
Can you give !!ONE!!! answer that doesn't start with or mention Donald Trump???
What is "assisanation"?
If you've done all that time prosecuting all these criminal organizations, why would you make it easy for them just to bring more and more drugs and more and more people in the country illegally?
Then why, V.P. ...are the EXISTING border agents now taked with putting the crosses on busses and sending them into the states? They are at least helping thee process, and kept from their former role of preventing this. Big question.
This was more of a lecture than an interview. If you ask someone a question, you need to stop talking for a minute and let them answer.
And what is she going to do about the open border.
She just never answers a question.  She drags things out to the point though don’t care to listen.  He should shut up and let her talk. It will prove she has no good answer
Did Biden/Harris policy on immigration work or made it worse? Made it worse...  Why you let them stay vs deporting. Which brought more illegal immigration because it was worth it under Biden/Harris administration to cross illegally.
He asked her how many 😂 and already she can’t answer the question but she says let’s get to the point 🤡
her bill didn’t pass… so they get rid of laws trump put in place that were working as a way to help the immigration?!? And then also let in 6 million immigrants?!
24:00 why must USA defend Israel ? Is this their 51 state or what ? Is Biden/Kamala from Israel ?
She needs to go She always dances around all the questions
If you interview someone, how about letting them answer uninterrupted?
Every time she says "let's be clear" thats our signal that she's about to give us a word salad that does NOT clearly answer the question.
I like the questions i just wish the interviewer would stop interrupting her every time she tries to speak. Seems very unprofessional.
I wish they wouldn’t have talked over each other. What a POOR way of being an interviewer if you are asking a question but truthfully not looking for an answer. This is the division in America, we aren’t looking to listen to understand but looking to listen to response!
FINALLY someone asking REAL QUESTIONS to Kamala. To bad she didn’t answer anything
Who heard her say 'burdened' and held their breath thinking she was going to continue with 'unburdened by what has been'?
He should have dared her to give a direct answer to a direct question.
She refuses to answer the question because she knows it’s her administration’s fault for the hell she’s putting our country through!!!
Is fox going to go after tRump to have him apologize to the familys of over a million people he let die during covid?
25 min? That's it? That's all the time she has to change our minds? She failed! TRUMP! MAGA!!
She failed to answer a single question. Everything was scripted answers, she talked a lot (over Bret) and never said a thing.
I still have no clue what her policies are..
The entire first 5 min is a lie & non-answer.
He could have done so much better?
Kamala wants to finish responding and when she does respond, she fails to answer his questions.
How many times did Bret interrupt the Vice President and not let her finish answering the question he had asked? Would he have interrupted and talked over a man that many times?
She says " Lets just get to the point " the question was straightforward.  Nothing difficult about it.
“Can I finish? I was just about to answer….” Continues to add more fluff words and dodge specifics…:.
Answer the question. Liar.
She refuses to answer the question because she knows it’s her administration’s fault for the hell she’s putting our country through!!!
I thought we were in the Biden administration where she is second in command, not the Trump administration.
Why do I get a feeling she was a bit high in this interview ?
Deflect from answering any question so no one can pin you down to your actual beliefs.
Ugh, just answer the f*cking question kamala!!
This is an interview? He just constantly interrupted her.
Grilled over direct fire
And the answer is?
So... what are your Plans Kamala!!!???
Avoiding the questions
Baier did the same thing with the Obama interview; ask a question and overtalk them on a response.....old play book.
How about she just closes the border? You won't need more boarder control officers, judges, etc.
Can she be quiet, listen, and then answer the question.  Wow!  Awful optics on her part.
They really got into the hard questions on this one!
17:22 Yo she gotta be slow? 😂
She answers absolutely nothing.
Who did he lock up during his presidency? Who’s been trying to lock him up non stop now? Geez
A solution she could still be working on seeing. She is the vice president. Why does it need to wait???
Where is your joy now??
Did she even answer one question without deflecting?
Can one person that supports her do a timestamp to where she actually answers a question?
Why she has not done those things ?
She was willing to answer the question. They not use to a grown up answering a question. Unlike that clown
Wow…. Deflect much????
I'm just wondering when Donald Trump is going to take on a hard question interview vs. cuddling up to frat bro podcasters and youtubers.  Say what you will about her answers, at least she has BALLS.
he asks a question and then before she answers it he starts talking again.  has this guy never done an interview before?
I'm not in no one's side but golly, Brett needs to shut his mouth after he asks a question. No respect or manners what so ever.
As shes arrogant woman and seems pissed of not answering questions
he asked her “how many immigrants have come over illegally in the last 3 1/2 years” she kept saying “let me get to it” but i’m 5 mins in and she still hasn’t answered
Answer the questions.
aw come on, she's not used to follow up questions, guys! doesn't she get points for showing up? give her a participation trophy.
Brett clearly had an agenda. Why did he even have her there if he was going to talk the whole time?
Way to debate BHO.
How can someone speak so much and say Nothing at all?
does this guy actually want to interview her? or just talk and ramble off cherry picked stats.  Let her speak dude you only have her for a short period of time.
Are these people in the comment section the same people that think's the election was stolen and that orange Trump is still president? It's scary how dumb you people are. You are the ones who need an IQ-test 🤣🤣
Why is she wearing an earbud, she need someone to give her the answers?
I don't think she EVER answers a question. She just goes on a rant of something to avoid a real answer.
She left her black accent at home last night?
Iran vs Israel  Not Iran vs US , missed the point of question
Who else ready for Revolution if this chick wins?
Real questions from a true journalist who expects real answers.  Kamala fail.
She can not answer a question clearly she just evades every question with Donald trump
she's obviously awful but Brett was a clown here. He couldn't stop talking over her. He should have asked direct questions where it's 1-2 word or number answers. If she didn't answer then jump in
Is she running for the president of Israel?
Is she wearing her "special " earing???
Whats the use of more border sgents when they are not allowed to turn then away to begin with.
This was an interesting interview but can you call it an interview because he was over-talking her? I'm sick of hearing trump deflecting and throwing insults. He had the opportunity to be the boss, and she has the opportunity to be staff yet you want to hold her accountable for her, not being the boss? American are something.
Perhaps they should have made it a stand alone bill and it would have been passed. But no they add an enormous amount of additional bills to this one bill, that’s why they did not pass it.
Just answer the question please
She’s hiding something… but she’s not saying it
Bret mopped the floor with her and he was just asking questions!😂😂😂
Who has been locked up since Jan 6th?  Under whose "justice department?  "Come om Man!"
peaceful protests? which ones? the ones where art museums are having to suffer thousands in damage? where protestors are blocking roads, stopping emergency vehicles from passing? the burning and looting of businesses? those aren't peaceful
anyone else notice that the "commercial ads" only start when she is starting to look bad? its never mid sentence... always right after he asks her a hard question
She keeps referencing Trumps rhetoric, demeaning slander..why every time I see her talk it’s her with the rhetoric and demeaning Trump? She is doing all she can to have him assasinated
She can't answer a question, ever! Hard to believe that she's even an option.
She is assuming voter stupidity and short attention span. She tries to squeeze as many words as possible between question and answer hoping the viewers forget the question. She is like the inverse of an IQ test. If you think she answered the question you are a verified stupid.
Is she campaigning for Trump?
Why did Fox let her wear those Nova H1 audio earings?  Who was talking to her?
Is this his first ever interview? How was he picked for this lol he needs to hush up
But it’s been you extreme leftists who’ve locked people up and censored those who disagree with you?
How can she prosecute a cartel that didn't exist while she was practicing law? Haha
How is this "news"? Interviewing your guest into an impossible corner then just interupting and changing the question when a real answer is being given?
Just answer the questions! Stop deflecting.
She still not answering the question on immigration. She knows how to manipulate the questions.
And she will speak like this with world leaders?...  Word salad, interrupt and speak over them, blame Trump, then get angry and aggressive to show her "Power".  Can you imagine what her "Word Salad" would be when translated into a foreign language?
Did she answer any questions?
Increase penalties for illegal crossings.  Does that mean criminal prosecution?  Does that mean jail time?  Does that mean family separation?
Answer Donald Trump  , question, answer Donald Trump , Question / answer Donald Trump my gosh Democrats do you hear her 😂
Every democrat in congress answered questions the same way kamila harris has answered them
So is Iran a threat to Isreal or the US, I’m confused?
She can't even answer a simple question.  Always beating around the bush. Such a disgrace. America can not handle this incompetence fool
It sicks me to hear her talk. She goes around and she does not answer the question. She answers questions the way she wants. She always gives a political answer 😣
I wish I had her skills as a kid getting in trouble and caught lying...man, she makes avoiding the question and art form.
Her tactic is dancing around questions and wasting time by evading the tough questions with irrelevance instead of giving the actual answer to THE QUESTION. Just ramble and then snap your fingers in a circle when the interviewer asks her to get to the answer.
Does he interrupt her because his candidate is weak? This level of aggression from the host in the interview doesn't represent strength.
1:20 do you have the stats of what detained released illegal immigrants commited crimes?
I wish I could avoid a question after I get asked a question at work 😂😂😂😂
What exactly is her plan…
Asks Kamala a question about her stance/policy. Response is talking about Donald Trump.
First of all, he wouldn’t of interrupted her if she was a man and second of all, she’s not gonna be able to answer the question because immigration has been handled horribly
I think the only grilled person there is the interviewer
Answer the question lady…all you say are lies
She is the threat to democracy, no one voted for her to be the Democratic candidate. I question the intelligence of anyone voting for her. If you’re voting for her because she’s a woman and because she’s not Trump you’re obviously not a very deep thinker. How embarrassing
She can’t answer one ducking question
So what is ur plans
Where did her Jamaican accent go?
Didn't  answer the question?
Poor Kammie the Commie doesn't like the followup pointed questions doesn't she.. awweee
Why doesn't anyone ask her to remove her earrings before the interview?
TRUMP IS AS SHARP AS A TACK WHY IS SHE SCARED TO DEBATE TRUMP ON HIS TERMS ... WITH NO TELEPROMTER
Someone is talking in her ear. She cannot answer a question on her own completely incompetent.
How can anyone think that Trump is better than Kamala? All he does is lie
How is this woman even running 😂
What about insurance?? Why do we not get a choice in who we choose to care for our family? We're forced to pay for insurance but not free to choose holistic. If so, it's out of pocket! Ummm we pay into this, where are our freedoms?!
She doesn't even know where is the US border!
Iran? Not China
Affordable housing?
Why doesnt she answer? Lots of excuses. Just crazy.
27 minutes of incoherent rambling. What sane person thinks she should be president when she can't even put out a single thought of her own? That was clearly rehearsed with scripted talking points and she was coached on just turning it around to try to make Trump the bad guy and not what the current crew has fumbled their entire term.
Wondering why on Earth people on here are saying Kamala is not clear.  They must be so used to hearing the words vomiting out of Trumps mouth (making absolutely no sense at all).
What woman VP wears same earrings over n over?   Do an interview without u talking ear rings.
Will it go round in circles?
So what was the music playing during that frantic tap dance.
How do you stop a spoiled brat from screaming in the store- you don’t spoil them in the first place. You people are truly helpless
never answers the questions
I'm so tired of the constant pointing of fingers to the other candidate. Just answer the question. We don't care what you think of Donald Trump's ideals
Just answer. The . Fkn. Question daaayum!
did she even answer one question?
Why do yall think some of trumps prior closest cabinet members and even his old vice president call him unfit for the presidency office. Wake up people!
It's interesting how when she's deflecting instead of answering a question that her tone of voice gets higher pitched. I always know when people are lying to me or trying to cover up something they did wrong when their voice gets a higher pitch than their normal tone of voice.
Virtually every question was sideskipped!
The amount of time she wastes using filler words is astounding. Its like an AI response... I wish Brett could follow up the questions with "can you shorten your response to 1-2 sentences".
the same earring with the ear piece huh?
Did people in the comments actually listen? Come on people.
Who locked up 100's of PEACEFUL J-6ers???
After this are people really voting for her ?
Stupid journalist you asked her questions let her finish why are you trying to make her look bad if you know so much get a good doctor for your candidate brain to be checked nonsense
She doesn’t answer a single question clearly, just bunch of nonsense words 🤦‍♂️
Turning the page....?
Do you think the American people believes on lies
Dance around the question of how many immigrants have arrived
Answer the frikin questions
Im a bit confused about medically necessary sexual reassignment surgery.
This lady is very nice and confusing. Does she has the aptitude to think or words just spill out of her scrambled mind ? She caught the Biden disease. Sadly is non treatable. Go ahead and vote her in. Need another 4 years of Demo action.
"Why do you think they trust trump more with the economy?"   Kamala: its clear to those who study  Translation: they're uneducated
Do you think she talks like that with her friends and family? Slow and dumb sounding, interruptive, with dramatic hand movements and facial expressions?
Does anyone have the count on how many times she references Trump
She knows nothing about honesty. Can she answer anything about blaming Trump.
How many is that???? Answer the question??
Totally sideskipped the question about Joe Biden's mental state!
I'm trying to listen, but she's not saying ANYTHING!
Can't she ever just answer a question... she dances around everything
I have a question for an American who's decided to vote for Harris..... Do you know what it's all about being the president of the US, or you're just voting on the basis of sensational politics and vagueness of being less informed? Do you know the election of the US presidents determines not only matters within the US but largely globally, and what happens outside of the US affects you significantly more than those outside the US? The presidency in the US is not about baby shower parties or discussing the American cuisines in the kitchens... It's more about facing the sworn enemies of the US like Iran, North Korea, China and Russia, and Donald Trump is the best qualified candidate for that job
Finally, an interviewer that asked real questions and doesn’t let her work salad her way out of it. She got roasted.
Let her freaking talk he asked her a question and immediately talked over her. ... this was bs. But what else do you expect  from a flip flopoing news agency like fox..
She did not answer the first nor 2nd question.
Why pay for transgender operations?
Still she can’t answer the question  Sad !!!!
This lady doesn’t deserve to be where she’s at can’t even acknowledge 1 question she wants to talk over this man
What an embarrassment that she wont answer the question and wont take responsibility for their actions!
How can he possibly "let her finisb" when she talks entirely in run-on sentences?
Why is she not answering the question and putting a blame on someone that’s not in office??!
Why do prisoners need to be trans? Why do they need cosmetic surgery? They are in prison. They don't need crap. And she never followed the law.
The 1st time sKamala got asked real questions!!!!
Seriously! Questions about Biden? Did he get his questions from Trump's campaign team?
He needed to stop her political advertising and bring her over and over back to the questions.
Has no one noticed she’s worn those Bluetooth looking earrings for EVERY interview and appearance since the debate???  No one is talking about this!!  Those earrings are too ugly for anyone to be wearing for every single appearance, unless they served an important purpose.
Why is Trump afraid of debating her?
Finally some real questions. Hold her accountable for her actions.
Only 26 mins?
It's so confusing how some people can still support this babbling idiot!?!?!!?
Does anyone else notice the same  Bluetooth earrings?!? She does nothing for me besides raising my blood pressure! 😤
wow when it's not a soft ball question you see how flustered she gets. what a clown.
My god, could he ask a question and then shut up? We wouldn't stop talking over her.
No candidate can ever answer a question directly..it's so old..it's exhausting..this country is broken and on the way down ala Rome.
STOP answering every question with demeaning Trump!!! She’s useless.
This is not the interview
Has no one noticed she’s worn those Bluetooth looking earrings for EVERY interview and appearance since the debate???  No one is talking about this!!  Those earrings are too ugly for anyone to be wearing for every single appearance, unless they served an important purpose.
So I went on her page, I can’t find her policies, can someone help me?
He literally wouldn’t let her respond to the questions
How can she stand herself lying all the time? She let them in before she was VP too!
Is this the entire interview?   Ive been searching for a while now.
Why does it sound like shes about to cry at some points
He asked for a specific NUMBER KAMLA LISTEN
Quit blaming trump answer the question ur responsible for. We can hear the bs
Whats not clear to you?   She had been much more specific re her policies.
Deflection in a political context refers to the tactic of dodging or evading questions, often by changing the subject. Politicians are known for using deflection to avoid addressing sensitive issues, and it is often seen as a dishonest practice
She is incapable of answering a single question with an answer. God bless you, Brett, for your professionalism and kindness with such a challenging human.
Ask her to remove earings 🤣
Let me be clear... by telling you everything other than the question asked....
She has been the boarder czar for 4 years!  Why do we still have a broken immigration system???
She really ran from that transgender question, totally sideskipped!
She can't answer a question??
still suspicious of those earings she wears....always
Answer the fu cking question u stupid bit ch!!!
No plan? Wow! She is disgusting
16:08 !  Oh what a in yo face question!! 😂😂😂
She's so angry and almost throwing a tantrum when the questions are difficult
Ask a question and interrupt the answer. Again and again. Is he afraid of Trump’s disapproval? Afraid of a spanking with a magazine? Because this is pornographic and Donny Puny Dong is panting. You’re not posturing for a side in Congress. You’re a pretend journalist for a partisan propaganda machine.
Hold on a second I’m confused, so her being the sitting vice president, Donald trump who is not currently in office, had more power to block a bill than she did to pass one?
Never answers the question never gives a direct answer!
I’m so sorry for her loss… BUT….  But? But? God forgive me… for I have no words to express how much I hate this woman.
I wonder why trumps amazing border wall didn't keep immigrants out like he said it will. Obviously his immigration solution didn't work.
Genuine question for those who say “she had 3 1/2 years” - what specific problems did Mike Pence fix in his 3 1/2 years as VP? Do you expect JD Vance to be able to overrule Trump on immigration, economic, or national security policy where they disagree (and they do disagree - Vance has been clear even post-reversal of his view of trump that his own opinions are different)?   In fact I would genuinely like to know, of any example, that anyone has, of a vice president being more responsible for any economic, immigration, or national security issue than the president?   I don’t remember any president running for re-election saying “oh that policy wasn’t mine that was my VPs”.   Come on guys, I support healthy criticism of her record - but you need to look at her record as an attorney general and a senator to make those points hit. If you focus on her “record” as VP then you’re not getting anything out of it because no one actually believes the VP has that much power.   The job of the VP - the actual job - is to be a “spare” in case of emergencies, and to go do some soft power handshaking with people who the president doesn’t want to deal with. That’s it.   If you all really think the VP has that much power then you really should be defending JD Vance more on his policy differences with Trump.
Thank you Brett!!! Love how she reiterates the question back to give her time to make up a bunch of words that doesn't answer the question. Her narcissism shows through in this interview. She belongs in Hollywood acting more than she belongs in the white house!
LET ME FINISH! BUT YOU NEVER ANSWERED THE QUESTION!!! Ugh, YOU MAKE ME SICK!!! HOW YOU BLAME EVERYONE BUT YOU!!!
Brad let’s get to the point and not answer the question. Shame on you
This was a masterclass in how not to answer the question asked. Also, a masterclass in gaslighting.
Ask a question, then interrupt as she answers the question. Got it.
was he rude at beginning of interview me and co worker arguing over this question
not one question was answered
I'm sorry, how does any of that help the "American" people?!  Broken immigration law? What specifically is wrong with it and how has what you've done  that would improve the law!
You ask a question and then interrupting her answering. Can you dare do same to Trump!
@21:27 Is she wearing devices in her ears so she can get help from her team?
Wow so they ask her hard hitting questions, barely lets her talk. Asks trump softball questions and lets him go off on tangents.
If the goal was to dance around the questions without answering them, then she won the award!
???????????????????????????????what????????????????????
Just fu* answer the question!!!
Is he interviewing or dictating?
I wonder what if it was Tucker Carlson who did the interview??? 🤔
Are you guys scared of mexicans?
Very clear? About what?
How could it even be this close? Wow what an imbecile
Sometimes I am just wondering who are those who go in her rallies?! How can you even listen to her filibusters and word salad’s without getting a migraine 🤦‍♂️
OMG I can't stand listening to this woman. She still can't answer a question. Someone needs to slap her.
What did Mike Pence do? I'm waiting
Someone ask her about her brotherinlaws benefitting off tenders etc financially in the Biden administration that we all know she managed Biden. She's weak. Highly intimidated by Trump
She has NEVER answered a question much less presented a plan
After that first question and her failed attempt at answering, I would have stood up, tossed the papers, turned my back and left. Simple.
Gordon Bennett. This is a political leader???? She can’t answer a question presumably because she doesn’t understand it. Alternatively, she wants everyone to see only what she sees. Either way she represents doomsday on this performance.
She don't demean american people? Like there isn't a video of Kamala saying the 20 year Old Americans are stupid. I can't stand her lies.
Can we get a list of the republicans that are supporting her?
She can't even answer a simple question. It's amazing people are stupid enough to support her.
he asked her “how many immigrants have come over illegally in the last 3 1/2 years” she kept saying “let me get to it” but i’m 5 mins in and she still hasnt answered
22 minutes in, and she still hasn't answered 1 question...... really?
Is she incapable of giving and actual answer? 😅
The framing of all these questions are attacking the Democratic Party in a way that’s insanely biased. What happened to fair and balanced?
Can’t even answer a simple question. Very incompetent person.
6:57 what????
How much money did y’all spend investigating Trump? You got a number for that Kamala.????????
Thank God somebody asked her some real questions
How did she get these positions.
She's literally dodging every question 😂
Stop evading the question and answer directly what you are being asked.
Dammit!!! JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION!! And get DJT 🍆 out of your fkn mouth!! 🤦‍♀️
A brilliant display of avoiding the question.
Can she please answer a f****** question
Great interview fox! Amazing journalism and questions. I’m glad yall both calmed down and got to some hard questions.👍
How much money did y’all spend investigating Trump? You got a number for that Kamala.????????
Why is it so hard to answer a direct question. She had an opportunity to explain to people some of the allegations being levied against her and instead of providing a detailed answer about policy or stance, she avoided the questions and shifted all responsibility to someone else. Also, someone has a temper.
they never really ever answer simple questions honestly  like most normal people
The host is interupting harris every time he is asking question.obusely they will not treat Trump like that.very bias!
Where’s Kamala’s joy??
Does she know how to answer a question? Well she ever admit she and biden made a mistake.
He’s asking questions Americans want to know, and yet she continues to be vague in her speeches. Her website looks like more BS
Why do we coddle people in prison
Great interview! Real questions were asked. Not real answers were given. Thanks Bret for making my election that much easier. ❤
not one single straight answer.  i challenge anyone to show where she answered any question, at all...
That’s a good one the Biden’s question
And this is why people don't like or trust journalists. This was a series of misleading questions. Every question was just a variation of "why do you beat your wife."
If you blame the former president for your failure the past 4 years, what's our guarantee that you won't keep failing and blaming it on the past if we elect you again?
Is she raising her voice 👀👀???
If more resources would've fixed the problem, shouldn't the monies given to Ukraine and others have been put their first?
FOX - MADAME VICE PRESIDENT WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?  HARRIS -TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP!!!
Answer the question! You never answer the question!!!
A new Generation?  What am I? Old generation? Do I not count? My way works for me. I’m not turning any pages or corners.
At what point can we hold this administration for treason? All of them.. anyone who had a part, a piece, or a vote.
Omg what a joke. How can you ask a question, and then try to answer it for her every single time? This was not an interview
I'm curious to know after this failed interview is she still willing to debate Donald Trump before election 💀🤣🤣🤣
He's rude, each time she tries to respond to his question he cuts her off, interrupts her, tried to prevent her from finishing the response.
Wow she swerves every question,  she really is retarted
She’s showing up for interviews, Trump isn’t. Why is that?
When asked about the US threat she failed to answer. She put Israel in front of us.
Finally, an interview that asks good questions!
I am confused what Q & A means. It seems the A doesn't follow the Q on just about every question.
Does she know how to answer a single question with clarity. She is absolutely not answering all the questions.
This is poor journalism. Fox had a chance to ask meaningful questions but decided to play to their base. We need a network just for independents.
It’s about time she has to answer some hard questions. You can tell she can’t handle this interview.
Is anyone else tired of "protecting" the world?
Why does he not let her speak out??
but she has no idea what those policies state
Does she have any answers that don't include Donald Trump?
Where was Leslie Knope born? When we come back we are gonna pull out a map and speculate WILDLY.
The question is never answered. What a joke wake up Americans she cannot run this country
Why does major Countries all have a Problem with Illegal Migration?I wonder why?
When she can’t answer a question she just tries her best to prevent him from re-presenting the question. 😂
Just go to her web page & read. Then maybe the answers to your ? Will be answered. If you truly want answers….
Gaslighting at its fullest!!!! She can NEVER fully answer the question! Trump for the win!
Yeah 6 democrats voted against, but how many Republicans voted for?
This was seriously like watching a 5 year old trying to answer questions. This is actually ridiculous the fact that she even made it this far🤣🤣🤣
She can NEVER answer any question !All she can focus on is Trump! Trump hasn’t even been in office for the last 4 years! How can anyone vote for this woman is insane!
It's very difficult to get straight answers from Kamala.  So, it would have been better to frame questions by packing them with facts, then ask a question.  If she doesn't answer, then at least he would have spewed fun facts in front of her face on record.
She is god awful. How on earth is she not prepared for these questions. She can't give a simple, actual answer to save her life. This was painful to watch and I could barely get through it. If she crumbles like this with a moderately tough, short interview, how the hell can she handle world leaders and the responsibility of being the leader of the free world.
Everyone complains she doesn't answer questions but how can she with constant interjecting and childish interruption
Interviewer trying so hard to cut her off at every question
I have never seen someone run away from answering questions directly more then this ding dong
Did she say anything about what she has done for the last 3.5 years, other than that she was in the situation room a couple of times? That's it? That's all she's done?
Are her earrings JUST earrings to help her answer?
BB: What about immigration?
Border wall or 1,500 border agents watching miles of concertina wire???
She can't answer a question... She uses word salads that don't answer his questions.
Homie asked a question then just interrupts every time she tries to answer
Is she doing her best Obama impression?
Stop the interview he is asking me to define policies.
Why do we have to listen to her??
Where is she getting all the money from to do the things she says she is going to do.  Answer the questions!!! Go trump!
How did former President Trump stop a bill? He was being accused of attempting a coup at that point in time. How did he have the power to tell congress what to do? It doesn't even make sense.
She is so stupid! She can’t answer a question! All she can do is throw rocks! Kamala answer the question instead of attack!
She can’t answer a question!!! She just keeps blaming trump!!!
Dang they’re letting her off her leash?!
You don't answer the question.She is lieing.
Is everything always a lie? Talk about trying to run the clock out, on few questions as possible.
What’s up with this so called “hard rap” what’s more important than interviewing a presidential candidate? Why are they letting her off the hook?
Can she answer one question? Instead of scooting around every question 😡
Does she ever answer a question?
She’s walking around every single question  I don’t care who she’s running against I don’t want 4 years of word salads anymore
She answered nothing.
can someone tie her hands so she doesnt scratch his eyes out
A lot of her "new" positions i have heard coming from Trump.  I wonder if he can sue for plagiarism.
Who in their right mind thinks she did well?
Is she capable of answering a question without saying the words "look" or "donald trump"?
Shes awful. She is a narcissist because that is exactly what they do, triangulation. Is she scared that her husband will beat on her if she says the wrong thing or are we seeing the real intelligence and character of the woman who slept her way to the top?
what plans, she has never put out any plan on anything!
Am I in power? wow I didn't realize that I am in power
Still don't have a clue on how to answer a question. Trump did it. Is her only answer
Why ask questions if you know you're going to continually talk over the person that YOU asked lol like does he just like the sound of his own voice? 😂
She doesn't let him finish a question yet she insists on finishing her lie.
Is this an interview or a roasting session? The amount of time this dude is cutting her off is wild
Trans national Criminal gang? Ok? Fair if you prosecuted them... Who are these Gangs? Any info.
Attacking trump is not answering the question
"Are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or illegal aliens transition to another gender?" is a question I never thought I would hear in my lifetime.
Can someone explain to me how giving a one time payment of 25,000 dollars to a limited number of people going to grow the economy?
This is like the politics from when i was younger where the host asks a question and then doesn't let the guest speak. It's hard to watch this trash news agency when there are so many other agencies out there that respect us viewers enough to not talk over the guest while we're trying to listen
Harris can't answer a straight question
How is it that she and Biden continue to push lies, falsehoods about Trump which are misinformation and disinformation but Republicans and Conservatives give them a pass?
What about making it possible for Americans to be able to afford food and medicine.
This is what we call proper journalistic questioning of a politician. Awesome job Brett
Does she have demenca also
Those earrings are ear pieces, they may have be altered to not look like the original, easy to do.. she wears the same pair everywhere…. What woman does that???    Obama in her ear… you can tell she is trying to repeat what she’s being told.
Next time, place a mirror in front of this guy sonhe can ask and answer his own questions since he would not let Her finish any of her answers.
She dodges and weaves so she doesnt have to answer.
Not a great interviewer. He asks a question and starts talking before she even finishes a sentence in response.
Why is no one pointing out that the border bill WOULD NOT STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
She never answered a specific question.
This isn what a liar looks like when pressed
Democrats, is this the best y'all can do?
Who has good comments for Dirty Knees Paris ???
Why not ask about the billions that have been sent to other countries?
How many time does she actually say “DONALD TRUMP” in the interview.
Interviewing Kamela is like dealing with a Narcissistic Ex...you keep asking a question for a straight answer and she goes on a little adventure that does not answer it and when redirected to answer the question she cries I was answering it.
She got him on the Jan 6th question
How come this woman can lie so much?. She is a disgrace and she should be investigated and prosecuted for treason and corruption charges.
I agree with the line of questioning but please let somebody answer first before bombarding them with more questions. Let your guests finish answering questions so that we know what their exact answers are.
She has notes allowed?
is it racial to get a job just because of being black
He asks a question but then interrupts whenever she answers.  🤨
Answer the question!!!!!
Finally!! Real questions.
Could you let her answer a question? Who is this turd
How are we not addressing that she wears the same ‘ear rings’ to the debate and any potentially difficult interview? How???
I'm so sorry BUT?! thats not an apology !
Can anybody watch Candice Owens multiple investigations into Kamala Harris and her family and all of the facts based with actual documentation that she has lied her whole entire career?
If Kamala Harris couldn't even stand up against Joe Bidens bad policies and decisions, how will she be able to stand up and stand strong against Iran, China, Russia and North Korea??? Something to think about!!! Or will she just hide away and blame it on Trump???
Can someone send this video to @taylor swift?
She is milking the time by talking about everything and everything but answer the question. She also likes to draw out her responses with a lot of non sense to take up as much time as possible.
He's asking u rhe past 3 year u been there ...what have u done answer a simple question.  We're exhausted by your rambling and blaming
they want support, but I took away their support in the beginning .... what is the problem?
She's good!  You go Kamala.  She handled this rude interviewer with dignity.  He's also a one-question pony.  All he did was attack. Trump didn't do anything to help anyone.
She answers questions just like my “EX”.
Can someone address the fact she showed up 15 late. So the interview was short then it should have been. And that why she used world sales to drag out time.
It always takes longer to answer questions you don’t have the answers to. 😂
WHAT THA HELL was all that....
Can we get a count on how many times she said “Donald Trump”?
Did she answer one single question?
“I will tell them I am so sorry for their loss??? “But I’m not sorry?! And I don’t owe them an apology? Total pig!!!
Is there really somebody in there right mind that looks at this woman and thinks she is really gonna do something better than what she has done these last 4 years???? She is a joke.
How many is que question and the point, so it should be answer with a number.
Does anyone else know if immigrants are American people?   Thanks in advance
Great questions. Now please ask Trump real questions also. We should hold both candidates accountable.
Answer the dang question
And she answered one question yet
Evading questions. she had four years to do so never fixed anything.
Do you know any of those policies Kamala?
What if Trump actually becomes a dictator? What is Project 2025?
Are those the Bluetooth earrings from the debate?
Another staged interview
She can’t answer a friggin question!
I don’t understand why she gets upset when he is just asking her to answer his question. Girl, it is an interview. You signed up to get interviewed.
She can’t answer direct questions with clear answers.
Why can't we answer some questions here below??
She is very obscure for everything. Is that a talent proved by American people?? She must have been rather a philosopher…. 😊
What do Camilla and Olive Garden have in common? Never ending salad.
Gotta be tough to answer questions without a teleprompter
Wow, just answer the question.  50 some minutes of an interview and she didn’t answer a single question.
Wow, nearly 30 minutes all deflected and never answering a single question with good faith. He gave her an opportunity at every turn to answer, and she did not, she simply deflected. I have zero faith her Kamala Harris.
She seriously has no idea how to answer a real question. To her supporters: just because she's talking does not mean she's giving an reasonable answer to the question. She is a complete embarrassment. Filibusters and word salads is her only tactic. One trick pony, unless you count the thing she does to get promotions.
20:47 The intention of this question is to showcase her ability or inability to take action when necessary to make an important decision, like calling out a weakness to be shored up. She basically proved she can't make these important decisions when it matters.
Can someone direct me to a clip where Trump said he would throw the military to whoever criticized him?
This is so painful to watch. Answer one question for the love of Pete and stop it with the deflecting.
How is she supposed to answer questions when he wouldn’t let her get a word in LOL
Why is Brett being such a jerk? He is not being himself at all.
Her plans are unclear what her future is for the country   18:02  Just blaming Trump isn't a plan !
She ran for president in 2019?  Thought that was Biden and she was just running as VP which that position has no real power to do anything 🤷‍♂️
Not one question has been answered
Where are all the Kamala voters???
Here’s my concern, if Brandon is unfit to run as president for a 2nd term why is he still president?   Why has Harris not taken over a president?  She hasn’t because she’ll be even more exposed as a flunky.
She can not answer the question. What is the number Madam V.P.?
Ask her why her and Biden opened the bordered when the border was already a mess
She just doesn’t answer questions , the interviewer is too timid , let Andrew Neil  from the UK loose on her , he will tear her to shreads .!!!!!
Bret: Madam VP what is your favorite color  Kamala: Donald Trump hates all colors  Bret: Madam VP what is your favorite food  Kamala: Donald Trump hates all of my favorite foods
Ask her, does she know where IRAN is and is it any different from IRAQ.....  most school children get it wrong....she would too.
0:41 she has not idea what that number is to his question.
Answer the question omg
What could be at the border, unburdened by what has been.
She takes like 10 minutes to answer a single question, that's why Brett's rushing her, because she showed up late, as usual.
How many years have democrats held office??
What about all our kids killed by Americans while they sit in school learning. I am so sick of this lying republican gun lovers that don’t give a dam about the children of the U S A.
Is it just me or did she played a part of the clown on maximum overdrive
Can she answer one question without bringing up Trumps name?
She NEVER answers questions
Wait. Isn’t your party trying to put Trump behind bars?
I was wondering when Trump’s campaign ad would end and the interview would start and suddenly Trump’s campaign ad was over.
Guy asks a question and won’t let her answer…just keeps trying to get her into a gotcha.  This isn’t a professional interview whatsoever that allows her to answer anything…and yet, she does a great job.
Some say she prosecuted only 10 cases in her “career”?
She keeps demanding to answer the question but she never actually answers the question...
She didn't answer any of the questions that were difficult because she couldn't. So she deflected to Trump.  She couldn't verbalize or policies because someone else wrote them for her.
Oh my sweet buttered toast... This woman could not answer a question with a simple straight forward answer if her freaking life depended on it.... Mr. Baier, thank you for doing such a great job.
This disgusting Neanderthal won't let her finish responding even the first question... dense af, just what you'd expect of an oblivious news media (FOX).
For someone that can't answer a single  question,  she has alot of things and lies to hide!! Why don't reporters  ask her "have you ever in your life answered  1 question "? 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Is anyone voting for her?  Honestly who is voting for her?
Didn't she put someone in Federal prison for 3.5 years for a PEACEFUL protest? Bevelyn Williams- charged with unlawful assembly for praying on the sidewalk.
Bret: *asks question*  Kamala: "Let me be clear...*gives nonsensical answer*  Bret: "Madam VP, the question was..."  Kamala: "Trumps fault."
Can she hear herself speak?
Why would she take this interview? Lol she looked terrible!
am I the only one seeing Obama speaking? The hand, head movement the way she talks is filled with Obama's way of talk lol... Obama really spent a lot of time teaching her and Clinton lol
She's wearing the special "earrings" again... who is talking in her ear?
What a Fing wanker he is…asks questions and doesn’t let her answer them.
it hurts to listen to this bs.  a one-word reply would answer most of these questions.  she goes on like a term paper word count.  stretch it out and never actually say anything.
Question One: How many illegal aliens were allowed in the country under your administration? Answer: It was congress's fault. "Leadership consists of nothing but taking responsibility for everything that goes wrong and giving your subordinates credit for everything that goes well.” Game Over!
She can't answer a question. She has to throw Trump's names in everything. Smh
This dude is HORRIBLE He won't even let her fully answer a question the first 5 minutes I can tell he's just trying to get back at her for them fact-checking and proving what Trump was saying was false LMAO get a life dude Harris is going to dominate Trump next month I can't wait
Does she have any idea how much people despise her
She danced with no answers and pointing at Trump for 30 minutes.
I’m not sure why he would ask questions and then refuse to let her answer. You guys live in the world of non factual cultural fiction!
She NEVER. EVER answers questions
Deflect, deflect, & redirect. It would be nice to hear any politician answer the questions asked of them just once.
What have you done lately?? 😮
What kind of journalist can’t let an interviewee answer the question?
He gets no credit for asking questions then interrupting her when she’s answering it.  That’s an agenda to say things that benefit your angle.    Guarantee you this guy, would let Trump p*as on his leg and apologize for being in the way.
Why is she still wearing the same ear phone ear rings. Let's see how she would do without her sneaky ear piece.
Why can't anybody just answer the question Yes or no.
She tightened things to stop illegal entrance?  Really?  Maybe it would help if she gave her definition of “illegal entrance.”
how did this people get to be state attorneys and high profile policticans ?
Deflect Deflect Deflect. Never answer the question.
Everything was but Donald Trump..but Donald Trump .....???
Does she actually answer a single question in this?
She can not answer a single question
Can everyone see the thumbs-down on the video? I can only see the number of likes but no dislikes.
Is Britt working for TCN Buy hasn't told Fox just yet?
He could have asked more questions if he had stopped interrupting her answers.
If your tired of demeaning talk from Trump, why do you keep talking about and running down someone?
This dumb b**** can not answer a single question.
Does anyone else notice that this isn’t the first result when you search it up on Youtube?
3:03 answer the question
Let a person answer the question you asked.
Omg, she is so dense. She can't answer a straightforward question for anything. That is not who I want representing me
Please tell me why Trump is dangerous, they say it all the time but never say anything as to why.. explain that please!
Who in the world wants to read your 80 pages🙄
Will she send all the murderers, rapists and child molesters back? Or keep paying to let them stay here in luxury?
SHE ONLY HAS WORE ONE PAIR OF EARRINGS IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS!!! HMMMMMM
What about Joe?
How can you be Vice President and not realize that we live in a representative Republic? We are not a democracy!!!!
The quoted statistics bewilders me as I am a 40-year-old American citizen & have never been asked those questions by a representative of the U.S. government. Are the percentages that Bret mentioned factual or made up?
Why is she pretending she’s not second in command of the United States? Everything she says she’s gonna do she could’ve already done.
She never answers questions.  She just babbles
Can she answer one question without saying Donald Trump's name?
Jib jab dodging word salad that never answers the questions
Does anyone else find her voice to be absolutely annoying?😫
What kind of dressing would you like on that Kamala word salad? I can't stomach this lady.
How the heck is she in charge of anything!?!?
Could anyone give constructive criticism on Trump? Is he a flawless candidate?
Brett is a terrible interviewer.
What’s your plan, woman? What is the plan?
He asked questions but kept butting in when she was trying to answer 🤡 But she killed it, well able for that idiot
Not one question answered
She's so weird. Why the fake white accent?
Doesn't she look tired?
She was tough and actually answered questions!  She did very well 👍🏻
My question is when would Donald Trump step into an “unfriendly “ territory and grant an interview?? He his out there accusing everyone of a witch hunt 🤦🏽‍♂️Well Done 🙌🏽👏🏽 Madam Vice-president.
Is flying 30,000 illegal aliens into our country flying them over the border 30,000 a month so that they will not be counted and they want to cross the border on foot 30,000 a month she knows what that number is it’s 20+ million since she’s been in charge of the border
I tried to watch but I can’t stomach her. Was she horrible as usual?
She can’t answer a question. She’s on the DEFENSE because she’s being interviewed by a conservative network.
Rambling on. Never answering the question. He's interrupting her script.
Why not take more time and let the lies come out and contradictions pile on.
Ask a question, immediately interrupt answer. Learn from this people, this is not how you conduct a civil conversation.
WT actual F?   Everything she said was not just an outrageous lie, it was an obvious lie.   Trump has done none of the things she claimed he 'threatened' to do, rather her party has actually done all of them for real.
a lot of words, answer the questions!  quit running out the clock with lengthy words that do not answer the question!!  JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION!!!!!
What's the point of more agents when they're not preventing people from coming in??
She does'nt even answer the first question all I heard was blah blah blah
If you get what the border control is going through, why are you making their lives so hard?
Is any politician honest?????
Are all those little pauses her trying to listen to her earrings? Lol
Fox news still cant ask the right questions. Get off of Joe and ask the right questions...sheesh
Finally, an interview where she gets asked real questions.
I never understand why tv hosts ask questions only for them to interject within 10 seconds. Ask your question and back off!!
A new home. We can barely get groceries. Finally somebody asked her actual questions. Thank you. There has been no “clear” about anything and people are seeing it
I worked with a number of people (usually executives) who could somehow "answer" any question with tangential references.  There must be a gene for it - or at least I am completely unable to even think of a truckload of information that could have some limited relevance.
Who the hell is voting for this ???
What a moron Camilla is, literally couldn't answer one question.
Yo, this lady refuses to answer questions. She just keep tango dancing around every question he ask her. She should go on dancing with the stars instead of trying to be POTUS.
I don’t think she answered one single question
Always deflecting the question.
Is Fox News a legitimate news service or just a front for  Trump?  Is Bret Brier a serious interviewer or a  Trumpian stooge?  This interview was not  what informed voters needed.  It was just horrible and combative from start to finish.  Shame on Fox News management team for doing such a horrible job 🤮
But...the QUESTION IS ...." DID SHE USE A VIN DIAGRAM to come up with her worthless plans" ????
Does she not own a different pair of earrings?
Kamala, Do you owe those families an apology for the murders of their daughters?  Are you continuing to fail U.S women?
It’s been 60 seconds and she already dodged a question and was rude 😂
We all know she would go home daily thinking Joe Biden is losing it... but she again mentions Trump when asked this question
Why does Kamala have to apologize for those three girl’s murders? Shouldn’t the murderers apologize for their crimes?
Answer the actual questions lady. PLEASE!!!!!!! Like at this point. And these are clear direct questions. ANSWER THE QUESTIONS!!!!
You mean all the people he fired found him incompetent?  Strange huh.
What has she been doing the last 4 year...?
Still can't answer a single question with facts. A total IDIOT
The correct question to ask is “why do you hate this country?”
Trump and her are phenomenal and not answering the question.  Trump wanders, she just says let me be clear, without actually being clear.  Awesome haha.
I can’t stand this lady evaded the questions
Pretty sure she didn’t actually answer one question
Ask her how she could get out of these killing wars. No plan no vote.
Absolutely insufferable. Dodging questions like Neo dodges bullets
She literally never answered a single question.
She is the queen of not answering questions.  I am so sick of her.
notice the earrings? If they were the special type, they sure didn't help - same earrings she wore during the trump debate
Where was my 25k down payment?  All I got was an 8% interest rate. If I would have known better, I would have bought a million dollar home in 2020..
Is she going to have a shaking voice talking to Putin, too?
Joe Rogan wouldn't let her non answer "answers " slide. He keeps on people until they answer the actual question.
Did she offer salad dressing with that toss?  FKH and FJB, Femall
What is this? You're asking her a question. Wait till she answers.
The 1st question and she three times sidelines it and  refuses to answer it.
🤪I am so confused if she has all these plans then why weren't any of these plans initiated during their administration? 🤷🏾‍♀️😂
If it was a priority why did it take 3.5 years to visit the border
Is she high ?.. like maybe a glass of wine and and a Xanax 🙄🤷‍♀️🤣
Honestly what does she bring to the table...only privileged morons will vote for this.
Doesn't answer questions only wants to filibuster and bash Trump
And why is Trump any better?
Who is "Tim Walls"?
Excuse me...WHO has been demonizing the American people? Last I checked her administration has been calling Trump supporters horrible things and jailing grandmothers for years without trial for being given a guided tour of the whitehouse......
When did she notice that Biden was losing it mentally? Haha, what a bunch of avoidance! I noticed that he was mentally unstable while he was running for office. My doctor did, too, and was furious that they let him run.
Did she have an earpiece and teleprompter again?
A few decent questions but all the wrong emphasis on follow-ups. So many missed opportunities.
The interviewer tactic is so disrespectful.  Biased much
What a great question - what will you turn the page on ?’ You were the vice president …
Oh when she gets asked tough questions,  she gets angry😂😂😂
Imagine if Trump was grilled like she was. He would cry about it and end the interview. She handled it with class. 👏🏼
Thank you so much, Brett for these questions that are 100x better than the other interviews of Kamala. She seemed to take what Joe has been given.
This is a joke on her part, right???
The interview is a Q & A. NOT a word salad for your Kamalies 🥴
How do they know the number of illegal immigrants in the country, if they are illegal? How did they count them? Lol😂.
Is she still wearing the same earrings?
she prosecuted parents and pot smokers....want proof of anything else she did.
Follow the law introduced and passed which the POUS can veto?  This woman is not fit to be POUS.
Clearly she was prepared for all interview questions until the question about Iran, then we see the real kamala who doesn't have a clue what she's talking about 😂😂
She’s sick, can’t even answer a simple question 😂
This lady hasn’t answered one question
Turning the page in the last decade from what? Trump?  Democrats have been in power for most of the decade, and what have they accomplished? What will changed under your administration Kamala?
Was this an interview or a debate? Another terrible job by Fox News.
Well that went as I expected. The one question no one is asking is their slow response to hurricane Helena. The American people need to see her squirm her way around that query. It’s unbelievable no one is asking that question. That could be any of us with a natural disaster. The slow response needs to be brought up continuously because she can’t blame Trump for that.
great question when did u notice biden was losing his mind ? cus u just might be blind lady
Harris can answer questions but trump cannot
Lord how do they do it...lie lie lie
Infuriating she won’t answer the basic questions at least half the American people have for her.
So when is DJT going on MSNBC?
What about the 325,000 + missing children ?? 😭😢
Wasn’t they in charge 9 months ago?
Why does she never answer a question straight on…feel like she tryna play me like I’m stupid
Why doesn't she attend a session with her press secretary and take questions directly from the press and talk all she wants and see what happens.
So if the economy is bad because of Trump, then how would a recession in the middle of next year be Trumps fault?  Wouldn’t that be hers and Bidens?  🤡🤡🤡
Who taught her how to be this stoo pid? My GAWD SHE IS GREAT AT IT!!!
REFUSING TO ANSWER A SINGLE QUESTION IS WILD!
I can’t stand her face as she gets righteous, while NOT answering a question.
She showed up late and attempted to filibuster the questions
she can't answer a question
Fix the  problem ? You are the problem !!!!
Can she answer a simple question without a long winded word salad?   And just think people will still vote for her.
Should of asked her what’s the cbp one app
Finally a reporter that asks though questions. I’ve learned that she can’t be trusted and let’s say something goes horribly wrong if she’s elected then who’s she going to blame???? That’s all I heard during this interview
Answer the fn question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone know how OLD donOLD is?  Anyone seen his birth certificate?  Was he born in Kenya?  I'd bet he's at least 93.
What makes gender reassignment surgery a medical necessity? What the inmates need is psychological treatment. They are doing this to get sent to a female prison. Partly for safety and easy pickings!
Are those her magic microphone earrings?
At what time will Brett Baier and others from Fox get it that Harris is NOT the president so it has NOT been her administration. Plus, any changes have to also go through the House and Senate... the House is run by Republicans so let's just put some focus on those people. THEY passed bills that Biden signed...notice, Biden signed them, not Harris.  Accuracy matters.
Is harris so delusional she does not realize SHE is the ENEMY within
First question and she automatically lies. I don’t even need to listen to the rest.
Finally, a REAL journalist who asked the tough questions AND THEN FOLLOWED UP when she offered up Bravo Sierra answers. Good job Brett 👏.
Finally good questions!! And we got to hear no answer responses.
I like it when she gets asked questions she doesn’t want to be asked.
Let's see, a choice between a seasoned Prosecutor or a Convicted Felon Rapist?  I'll stick with the Law.
Alot of deflecting
She knows she’s only got an hour and she tries to run out the clock on every question while not answering anything.
why does she ALWAYS wear those EARRINGS????
Why do we have to pass a bill why cant we just enforce the laws we have?
If projection was a person...
people are complaining about vague answers; as if trump ever provides clear answers to a question.
Dodged literally the first question lol
How is trans.gender surgery a necessity??
How is Thousands of illegal immigrants coming in droves Trucks and everything if it's so much border control smh make it make sense
Bluetooth earrings?
What is up with this comment section -- were we watching the same video?
Wait😮 what just happened? Did Brett just called us stupid? Am I wrong or did Brett bear just call us stupid for voting for Trump?
How is it that a CONVICTED FELON can even be considered to be president?  Isn’t it true that he would not be able to receive top secret briefings? He’s a disgrace.
I’m used to politicians not answering questions but this is a new level of not answering questions
I’m used to politicians not answering questions but this is a new level of not answering questions
The interviewer guy was extremely rude. He asked questions and didn't let Kamala respond. Never saw such a rude interviewer.
Who coined the term "deplorable"?
8 minutes in, still haven’t answered a single question
Is Brett Baier auditioning for Trump's spokesperson?
Going after people that disagree with you like putting Gabbard on a watchlist? Hmmm, Kamala?
Be honest with yourself and ask yourself if you would hire this person for a mid level management position with-in a company you own.
Wait....is this her real voice finally...????   20:23
How does a broke government offer anything but budget cuts? Beyond me
What is crooked kamala gonna do to win the hispanic vote? Pull out her phone and play a latin song to a crowd like crooked biden did?? 👎👎👎
This man is hounding over and over looking for a certain answer yet he refuses to listen to her
But what are her plans? I am really struggling to find anything of substance.
Not even close to being clear
I'm almost 2-1/2 minutes in, and she wasn't allowed to answer/respond to questions without being interrupted. 🤨
Have you noticed scamala wears the same earrings with every interview???😳😳🧐🧐
Question what is the chips and science act????
Can she let me know where my loan relief is that I was promised 4 years ago?
What did she do as vice president of America?
Is Brett on the ballot? Fk me, he spoke more than she did. Faux News at its finest, showing what a propaganda joke they are 😂😂😂. They've inadvertently helped Harris, so I'm much obliged ✊🏾
Same earrings...hmm.
She can’t even answer a question.  All she wants to do is bash Trump!!!
She will not answer the question because it will incriminate her
Why do so many prominent Republicans and people that worked in the Trump administration support Harris now?
Harris wants finish whole interview with just one question...  bla bla on and on ....
She can't count that high.  Unable to answer a simple question...embarassing.
Thank goodness Fox didn't let her talk her way out of questions.
Never can answer the question, can she? Earpiece must not be working.
Yes his questions were real, her answers were bs as always, word salad, yak yak yak.
How is she going to sit down with world leaders if she can’t even handle a simple interview ?
Where’s the full video?
Did she answer any question asked?  Deflect deflect deflect!
@rmfreeman1987 Hold president trump accountable how? By holding him in legal battle witch-hunts while perfectly aware he’s attempting to run for political office? I think that’s called prosecuting your political opponent, something reserved for Russian politics.  Your inability to see you’re the monster discontent with anything short of his head on a platter is more of the problem than his bombastic speech patterns, also, umm, look at the economy, prices, crime, etc.
She can not answer a single question
Does she EVER do anything except MASTUBATE with words????
She cant answer a simple question without 5mins of word vomit and still no coherant answer..what a bluffer.
Spending American taxpayers' money for illegal migrants not dividing the country?
Peaceful protest???!!!!!! it's a CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC!!!!!!
Cut the crap!!! Answer the question!!!!
Can she just answer a question straight forward without spewing a bunch of nonsense? How could anyone want her at the negotiating table for us!?
What's wrong with his face? Was he in a fire?
Wow he didnt let her answer uer first question. This isnt going to go well. I dont know why sje agreed to this. All they will do is set her up for gotcha moments and headlines
Beware of people who avoid answering questions.
How about all the money you spent on ads telling your lies..
Finally, no soft ball questions.
What is with this guy constantly interrupting her?
She can't ever answer a question. She can't ever make a point she can't ever say. I'm sorry this lady is delusional. She belongs in a mental institution
First question and she can't give a number
She can’t answer a question if her life depended on it!
This is more of an interrogation and trying to pigeonhole her to stupid Fox News talking points.   Donald Trump can’t even discuss ANYTHING without blame and finger pointing….yet she’s the wrong that’s wrong… 😂🤣😂  Yet, Trump stood at a townhall playing music for 30 mins…and there is NOTHING wrong with that, right! 😂🤣  Americans against Americans 😂🤣🤣
Why hasn't she got a red lipstick dot on her forehead like her mum n dad ? She should be proud of her pakistani izlmists heritage no? 😊
It like talking to a kid covered in chocolate and you ask about the chocolate and they just keep saying but the other kids had chocolate to the point you just want to shake them cause you’ll never get a straight answere
I’m impressed with the way that Brett Baier pressed the VP on issues and answers!
If she has no concern about bidens mental acuity, why did they pull him and place the cue.
Why haven't you stepped in against Iran? Because you have personal interest
Ty for finally asking her questions instead of throwing her balls to play with
"What would you say... you do here?" -Bob
Typical Dumbocrats avoid the question and blame everyone else.
She can’t answer the  question
As always, she refuses to answer the question and try’s to go on a rant about President Trump
Why is the interviewer over talking Kamala ?
Who raised this guy to think interrupting and talking over people is good manners?
Is anyone else reminded of the Monty Python arguement clinic skit? Where he just denies everything they both know is true?
She never answered a single question.  Shes sooo dumb
Absolute CLOWN. Did she answer a single question he asked? Also, why does he have to 'let her finish' but she can interrupt every sentence?
People are exhausted of Donald Trump, or are exhausted of the portrayal that the fake media has done of him and the people finally have seen through all the lies? This woman is a disgrace!!!
So how come she or Biden didn’t turn any pages last three and half years ???? Everything is Trumps mistakes still ???
That was awful. Shrill, whiny, and full of nothing but dunking on Trump. Not one solid actual answer to any question. Lots of words…but ZERO substance. What a shrew.
Just answer the questions
People here have listened to Trump, his fear mongering and hateful speech, and they don't like what Harris said? Conservative suckle on fear and hate. Work of the devil?  Pretty sure Jesus would support how Harris speaks. Trump only talks of hate and fear. Devil's work.
Who the heck is she yelling at and wagging her finger??
Brett 👏👏👏 finally someone is asking her real questions!!!
Isn't 'transitioning' an elective surgery?  She'll follow the law.  oh, great.
If immigration is so important then why did Trump turn down a bipartisan bill to protect our borders?!
God? Is she really potentially our president? God bless america
If  Trump is so bad then why is half the country supporting him and why is he beating you in most swing states? Its an election, its not supposed to be easy..... Um, okay....
Ooo .she trying to look mad! Lol what happened to Joy??
Kamalalies, Kamalalies, Kamalalies, why are you so upset with the truth
she is done ✔️ I am so frustrated to listen to her lie and denied and jumping arround and not answering the question. Let's me be clear and not clear
Cameltoe, why aren't you making things better now, YOU'RE IN POWER NOW!!!
Thank you for trying to make her answer a question, but she will never
Why did she put thousands of illegal immigrants on buses and send them into American cities if she was trying to stop them
Wow this woman's nothing but word salads never answers a question straightforward
$25k for first time home-buyers? $25k in the Midwest is much different than $25k in California or New York. Do first time home-buyers need to move into the Midwest or will something be done about the out-of-control housing market in these other states?
What is the plan? Thats what I want to hear.
If he asks a question, he should shut up long enough to allow for an answer.
Avoiding every Question with a Word Salad Answer!!!
You mean like how they turned the FBI was turned into American citizens from Jan 6th??? Ppl that are just standing in a  crowd outside who didn’t even go inside the capital building??? They were involved in peaceful protest!! But look at all these liberal protest burning crap down in 2020 or all these Palestine protest and NOTHING HAPPENS!!!
Never heard her just answer a question without a tangent. It’s a shame 😂 I couldn’t imagine a country with this as our leader.
Could she just take responsibility and answer the question! She beats around the bush too darn much!!
Does she believe the bs she says?
Talks without answering a question and not making sense
This individual will NOT answer a single question
“That is a great question, it’s a question about a conversation people want to have. It’s a question that I will never answer, but given enough time, will be your last question which highlights how important it is for ALL Americans.”
Donald Trump would have folded up like a blanket under this type of questioning.
Gotta love the first question, thank you for bringing it up but I won’t answer😂
So you got to break it to fix it, Kamala?
Is there any presenter on Fox News who hasn't had rather terrifying plastic surgery.
Talk about evading every single question. She answered nothing. She’s clueless and unfit for any office.
It's ironic that she can't answer a question clearly. She basically just rambles on and on.
Bret: asks a question Harris: “but Donald Trump”
Can she answer a question
2 questions in and there's a lot of talking in circles and no answers given. I'm already sick of trying to listen this woman. Voting is useless anyhow.
Didn’t this woman see the millions who came into the USA without even stopping them.
She seems to be offering a lot of plans but doesn't seem to be telling us what the plans are?
Is this the first interview she doesn't get the questions beforehand? My respects for this brave man 👏👏👏
Kamala, how does it feel to be in front of a real journalist for the first time??
How can you blame Trump when he hasn't been president for the last 3 years?
I never remember the question when starts to answer it because she isn’t answering it
Well, I have been unburdened by what has been, and I was raised in a middle class family! Next question!
If she's against Iran so much, why is she putting the election first over Israel?  And why do her policies support the victimization of American citizens, especially those in the universities that are being funded by Qatar?
Even though I already voted for Harris, I wish she would answer those questions about Biden and not deflect to Donald Trump.
Kamala takes way too long to respond to questions, and she doesn't even answer them.
I don’t know how anyone will vote for someone that cant answer a question
Lair Lair pants on fire . She never answer a dam question.  Can't trust a person that don't answer a question.
What the hell  she talking about she always deflects to Trump she helping his campaign with her banter of word salad stupidity
Wow answer the question 🙄
She is so dishonest, she sidestepped just about every question asked of her. Can you imagine her having to meet with foreign leaders? How can she be trusted?
Shes a deceiver cant answer real questions. Vote TRUMP
Oh faux news, don't t ever change. Let me ask you a question,  then talk over you while you try to answer.  What a joke. Poorly performed hit piece.
Just word salad off the bat trying to waste time and not answer the question, dancing around the bill, unbelievable
Is she talking about when she allowed people to hop on buses and sent them throughout the country?
Excellent questions by the Fox reporter and Kamala just evades and evades the questions with her ridiculous word salads! 🤮👎
Does this woman ever answer a question directly, queen of digressing from the point to avoid accountability and using false accusations in blaming President Trump for her administration's failings.
Just answer the question Madam Vice President!
This guy does not know how to have a conversation. How did he get this job?
Why can’t she recite those 80 points?
This woman is incapable of answering a direct question.
She just rambles, also try’s to blame everything on trump, but yet when trump was in office life was great! Hmmmm?
When is a gender reassignment surgery EVER medically necessary? These people are deranged and there’s a special place in hell
This honestly embarrassing her answer to every question was an excuse, what she vaguely did to make herself look good, or everything is trumps fault smh🤦
Trump would have gotten so pissed if he was asked these types of questions and probably not answered half. I hate the fact that both always talk about each other rather than be honest on mess ups.
Why didn't they keep Trumps bill in place?
Is she going to answer a question?
Lol, Thats what I do in job interviews so I asked least questions
What is your favorite color? Instead, let's get to the point.Trees are green the sea Is blue and i'm just terrible
She is completely incapable of answering questions. She is all word salad to avoid being direct.   She is 1000% unqualified to lead anybody. Her entire administration can't keep Trump's name out of their mouths.
She has her debate earrings in... who you think she is listening to?
This "person " cant just answer a question like a normal person.  Pure full of sh!t!
She tried to shame Brett for interrupting her but she still never answered the question
When asked if she still support a law,, the answer should’ve simply been no.. Admit to your mistakes!! Dang!! Can’t trust this woman..
How is the media gonna allow her to wear the SAME Bluetooth earrings
Was there a single real answer in this whole interview?
As a home builder, I’m not sure how she will bring more housing supply 🤔….. does she know how to lift a hammer?
Why won’t she just drop out of the race and do what’s best
Is she gaslighting herself too?
He didn’t want her to provide answers and kept interrupting her. This was more of an interrogation rather than an interview. Very unprofessional.
Do any of these political puppets answer a question or take accountability for their actions.
How is it people can vote for someone who had almost 4 years to fix this crap and all she did was turn her back on this country?
So Joe Biden was an experiment? Freudian slip? 🤔
So Joe and Kamala wanted to pass a bill to fix the border. Really? How then it turned out they opened the border after that? Not buying that bait
Reading how divided people are on kamala and how the interview was a "debate" is wild.  An interview in this capacity, (with a presidential nominee) isnt just soft ball questions letting them answer what and how they choose.  You press and prod on the REAL questions they haven't or won't answer.
How are people listening to this and hearing nothing? Are you deaf?
Blah…….blah…….blah!! Word salad………she never answers a question………..just skirts around it.
Who voted you in to represent the "democratic" party? Where the he'll was democracy with that decision?
Starts off not answering the question she’s asked in typical Kamala fashion 💀
She dance around  questions and never answer directly
Wow she answer question a lot better then Trump... she stayed and faced it. Not like the orange toddler who run away on any little difficult question.   So much stronger than Trump.
Answer the dam question woman
They asked her one question what is the estimated number of persons that crossed into the US
Thank you Bret for asking real questions.  If only you had let her answer.
Bruh. Please just answer the question. We don't need your history lessons.
She can’t even handle an interviewer , how is she going to handle very intimidating leaders ?
Decade? - 6yrs was democrats in charge! Can’t blame Trump for the last decade!
She never wanted him to talk and actually get to the question.😂
How many people are suing Trump? How many were suing Trump when he ran the first time?  Only 1 or 2 people were sued more in our country. He does not pay for anything. He says he will but he lies. He never folds..he rolls with the punches..waits to see if he wins.
What did you fixed the problem in 3 and half years ???? You fixed nothing at all.
The worst interviewer
There is two questions that I would have like to see her reaction to! 1. What do you say about Obama rubbing black men over the knucles for not voting for her. 2. What is her response to the accusation that her husband physically abuse a woman in public.
Any fox news viewers convinced to vote for Kamala?
Fixing a problem?? You made it worse. You think we're stupid. Get them out of power
What kind of Q&A is this? She didn't even dance to avie maria & YMCA for 40 minutes. NO ENERGY!!
Also what other country when you do finish all their paperwork to get into their country then subsides that immigrant with tax dollars like housing , incentivizing businesses to hire them perhaps with tax incentives , Housing vouches , phones , transportation? NOT the 2 I researched you had a have a savings of certain amount, a way to support yourself when there , a place lined up to live,  I think it was France that even required you to have a French Citizen that would help you .  ANd no criminal record.  And it took a long time
Is it really that hard to send more border agents to border.shouldn’t take a new bill
She's such a dumbass that wont answer a single question. If shes not gaging on her boss she's gaging on legit questions
Bret: *Asks yes/no question*  Kamala: "Let me be clear [insert no-substance filibuster pointing finger at Trump]."   Bret: "You've been in office for 3.5 years..."  Kamala: "Trump has been running for office." What a clever retort.
In case you didn't know the phrase "let me get to the point"  means i am going to not answer the question.
The last decade, Democrats have been in office 6 out of those 10, right? What page are they turning again? Trump has been living rent free in their heads, though...
Over the last decade 6 of those years was under democrats sooo ?
Why do they call it the Biden-Harris administration? We don't talk about the Trump-Pence administration or the Obama-Biden administration. Harris is just a vp not the POTUS.
She still doesn't answer direct questions
17:42 the last decade? Obama has been in office from 2008-2016. Trump 2016-2020. Biden 2020-2024. So we had 12 years of democrats and 4 of republicans over the last 16 years
The interviewer did a terrible Job. If u ask a question let ppl answer without Interrupting
The woman does not answer anything! How can people follow this woman!
She's didn't answer the question. She's just buying time all the time.
Jesus Christ.. I'm so glad these questions are questions we are allowed to rightly have in her eyes...
Can she answer a simple question?? All she do is thinking about trump😂😂 what a joke
Is she REALLY that damned stupid?
Wouldn't be the smart thing to just write a bill that added 1500 border agents and nothing else? I mean what I am sick of is politician adding a hundred plus things to a bill when they say, look we can all agree on 1500 border agents. Then reject it because of all the extra garbage.
2:26 the guy is so rude to her! Let her respond to the question
The only real question here is does the U.S. want a self-proclaimed WANNABE DICTATOR, Trump, , , or anyone, ANYONE who does NOT WANT TO BE OUR DICTATOR, or ANYONE who did NOT SAY they want to TERMINATE OUR CONSTITUTION?
Trump stole how many boxes of classified documents?
Where’s the immigration VEN diagram … let’s take a holistic approach to it …
Can anyone lie more than Kamala?
She doesn't like unscripted questions that aren't beach balls pitched to her underhand
Did anyone else notice a Freudian slip by Ms. Harris when she referred to former VP Joe Biden’s “experiment” and then subbed it with “experience”?  Perhaps the installed Biden regime was an experiment in many ways toward morphing our Constitutional Republic into a Marxist dictatorship.
She gets bitchy when she can’t answer the question
This woman doesn't answer a question at all !!!
This was an opportunity for her to actually answer questions about what she would do. But she blew it by doing exactly what she accuses Trump of doing.
I wish these reporters would keep their questions shorter.  On and on and on for 1 question
Talk about some tough questions! Donald Trump would have walked out of this kind of interview after the first question and spent the next month whining about how "mean & unfair" it was. This is the role of a free press and anyone seaking the presidency should know that and pursue it for the public service that it is. Thank you Bret & Kamala for demonstrating this for the American people.
There's no grilling those are questions that she should have answered not filibustered
Is she yelling at Brett?   She completely lost her cool.   She was practically pointing her finger at him.   She should be ashamed.    She came for an interview and then got mad when they gave her one.
Is it just me or is she extremely delusional?
@Jrose3144 Milley has never been right in his life? That seriously brings into question Trumps judgement then, for appointing him Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff…..I would think long and hard about supporting a president that has that poor judgement when appointing his staff.
Bret thank you for your hard hitting question. I wished she would have answered some of the questions.
Dancing around the question “let me get to the point”
Wow! selective hearing! All I heard was the interviewer asking a question AND NOT letting her answer then talking loudly over her. Trump is the problem, He has caused so many national and international issues and I am confused how others do not see that! Trump Blindness is like an epidemic with no cure!
Where were the fact checkers?
She can't answer one question.  She can't run this country.  Imagine her getting questioned by China or Russian leader.  They will see right through her.
My god she is so vague
What is she waffling about?😂
Did Kamala make it a short interview or was it Fox News?
She came off as strong in thus debate.
I wonder if she's good at dodgeball too? Dodging all these questions... 😆
Finally someone really interviewed her with real questions
So I didn’t get one answer to any question 😂
What happened to his face?
Who could actually vote for that????
Does she ever answer a question?
Turning the page from the last decade…..maybe she doesn’t know exactly how long a decade is? Her people have had the White House for the majority of the last decade. 2014-2024 has 6 years of Democrats and 4 years of Republicans. So….
Are they the only earrings she owns, never wears any others, we know what they are! Thanks Brett for asking real questions, clearly she can't handle them with any intelligence.
How many times did she bring up Donald Trump?
Then why is democrats given the money comphad it taken care of when he dropped that giving them money and look what happened?
Say what?
Trump could never handle an interview like that
Trump wasn't in office try again You and Biden were
Am I the only one that thinks she was drinking? She was belligerent. She slurred some of her words. And her team wanted to get her off of there in a hurry. It can’t just be me that wonders about this.
How can anyone look at her and deem her fit for purpose, is beyond me. She’s a kind lady, but the President role is a tough one.
Did she answer any part of the question? She is so ugh...
At the 0:17 mark you asked a question. At the 0:57 mark you asked it again after constant interruptions. How can you expect an answer if you never stop interrupting?
How do you know if she is lying? Her mouth is moving!
She still didn’t answer a question lol
Finally real follow up questions….
Leading from the knees?
In the first 2 mins, this guy asks a question, interrupts her, then asks another question, then interrupts her again.
If kamala was a rapist and convicted felon, would she still be in this race?
It seems she still has voices in her ears ... it felt like purposely she was talking slowly, cause she was listening to someone & answering - was there a check to clarify if her earrings are not earphones?
If Trump is to blame for issues during this administration, how will he not do it again during hers? Give me a break Kamala! You’re in over your head!
How does she plan to pay for all this social assistance? She should know that someone will have to pay for this.
STOP BADMOUTHING TRUMP AND ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU ARE ASKED YOU ARE STRETCHING NON ANSWERS TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ASKED.  BRILLIANT!
This interviewer is asking loaded questions - absolutely ridiculous. Is America not capable of proper debate and conversation?
At the 0:57 mark Brett, you already had asked the question at the start of this video. But you never stopped interrupting Kamala as she tried to answer. How can anyone give you an answer, when you never stop talking? FOX is total BS!
God the amount of times he cuts her off. Typical FOX ‘news’ baiting BS to make her look bad and then saying she doesn’t answer the question. At least it’s better than an orange fool dancing for 39 minutes instead of answering questions.  The things unintelligent people fall for..
Why won’t she answer a question… it’s so weird.   We should have Kamala Harris day at work and just not answer questions at our jobs 😂
Who weaponized the government and was told to spy on catholic congregations and pro-lifers?  What about parents who opposed offensive sexual content /orientation/pornography being taught to their children in schools?
You think convicted felon trump answers his questions? Haha! He literally stopped questions at a town hall the other day to dance to opera music for 40 mins. That literally happened in Pennsylvania over the weekend. I’ve never seen that happen in my entire life. And trumps “concepts of a plan” isn’t an answer either like when he was asked about childcare and replied with incoherent nonsense. The double standard you’re placing on President Harris vs convicted felon trump is astounding.
She really doesn't have an answer to a question unless it involves Trumps name 😂
She dis good for her , but never answered the question !!!
Does she have any new lines we haven’t already heard a million times 😅
That was like watching an elementary school game of dodgeball. She can’t take responsibility of her own actions, can’t answer a straight question…it’s hard to watch.
Why hasnt fox news grilled trump on his ta rri fs and ask him if he understands how t arr ifs even work
She want answer the question shes a lier
Bret asked real questions but still allowed her to weasel her way out of giving any real answer
He doesn’t let her talk. He asks questions, then runs her over and interrupts her. Oh yeah, good job Brett.  His poor wife deals with this at home. Guarantee it.
What happened to the notion that she cant pull a sentence together because of her low iq? 😂😂  its getting harder and harder to believe fox news rhetoric.
She gets 1st place in evading questions
She is trying to eat up time  NOT answering a question, but simply throw a word salad out there and a couple trump did it.
Does she even hear what she's saying? No because she has an ear piece in filling her ear with propaganda.
non american right here. America i love you but how is she vice president !?! legit question 😂 she's dumb as rock
Harris just wanted to finish her long bull crap NO nothing answer to stall For not going to answer the question !
Do y'all listen to her with a prejudiced mind? If so, how can you be honest with your assessment of her?
She should write a book on how to NOT ever ANSWER ONE QUESTION and blame Trump for everything.
For Christ sake, can this b!tch answer a question.
She's so afraid of his next question, she won't respond to any in a timely fashion. She just yaps. Let he talk for three minutes and she still acts like he's interrupting her. She is horrendous.
One word salad after another. She still doesn’t know how to answer a direct question. This woman is inferior
He wants no word salads, answer the the questions without them moron.
ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR GODS SAKE. 😂
Bret Baier mistakes rudeness for journalistic spunk. When a question is asked, the answer should be permitted to be given before throwing follow-ups. Another embarrassment for Fox News.
Kamala Harris is so rude. She won't answer the question and just wants to be allowed to go on and on about nothing. Interrupting him and not answering the questions and speaking to him like that makes her look insane.
Isn’t this the same immigration bill that gave over $80 billion to Ukraine and Israel and on $20 billion to “improvements” to the us border security? Why does know one call her out on that?
Supposedly if she knows where the problems are, then why doesn't she fix the problems?
Is she on drugs? Always blaming trump! Blah blah blah! Stupid not even owning their administration mistake!
i hate when a candidate is asked a specific question to explain something about their record, they completely avoid answering the question and instead talk about the other candidates record. they ALL do it because the answers would expose their flaws and make themselves look terrible.
Is it me or does she say the same thing at EVERY event ?🤣
She basically filibusters his questions lol
The question should have been, why can't  you answer a question directly and without mentioning Donald Trump.
I just wanna know how this election is even 50/50 how could half the country wanna vote for her? How is that even possible
I don’t think I’ve gotten one clear answer to any of the questions asked. 😂
Dude roasted her and all he did was ask questions....😂
After watching just 6 minutes of Bret Baier’s interview with former Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), two questions occurred to me: one, why didn’t he mute her mic when she delivered [anti-Trump] speeches instead of answers?, and two, why didn’t he conclude with a yes or no answer to his own unanswered questions as did the talk/opinion show hosts at CNN and ABC whenever they didn’t like Pres. Trump’s answer? Though I believe he could’ve been tougher on exposing her inability/unwillingness to answer his questions, at least he didn’t conduct a softball interview that many feared the FNC management would pressure him to do.
How can you tell if someone is a liar. They keep raising their eyebrows every time they talk.
Weird that he cut the interview so short. Didn't he want to learn more about her policies? Why not let it run for at least 90 minutes rather than barely 27?! o.O
A priority? since when?
She sounds like a ridiculously bitter ex-girlfriend who won't give him back his hoodies ... answer a question without saying donald trump
What credentials must one have to become the candidate of the dums ?
Who's this guy?...Seems he rehersed 100years for this moment 🎉
Is this an interview about trump or how we are going to fix the clown and pony show? Leaders deal with it and figure out a solution.
What do you mean by not stable clarify and you won't Brett gave you three different opportunities about different things that he could be unstable about and all you can say is he's unstable it's because you don't know what you're talking about you're a liar
What happened to her southern accent?
Answer a bloody question ,stop rambling
Don't answer the question, just pivot to attack Trump. What a loser. Those aren't answers. The level of rudeness to a guy that is being polite is gross.
She won’t answer the question
Is she wearing those same earrings again that many thought were hearing mics?  😅 I am not saying they are or are not but my inquiring mind wants to know
Something is seriously wrong with her mentally.   She has absolutely no idea how to answer a question.
Her brain shut down and now she's not listening to the question at all.... the look on her face says she's all kinds of pissed off.
If the Governor of Texas had a crises why didn’t he invoke and call upon his Texas National Guard for this crises? Why traffick them to other States? Why have a disregard for the Natural Born Citizens of those States?
So… if she’s going to make such a change, why hasn’t it happened?
Baier: Legitimate direct question.  Harris: Deflection, rambling, Trump attack.  Baier: you aren't answering the question.  Harris: LET ME FINISH! You aren't supposed to remember the question by the time I'm done rambling.
This moron can't answer a question, she dances around them
Finally being asked the straight questions
Can't answer a single question.
OMG this is great! Thank you Bret for asking the tough question. You truly are the LAST news person on any network.
How on Gods earth did this woman get to be where she is? She seems to be completely oblivious to the fact that she’s been in power for the last four years.
Better question is this why did Governor Abbott traffick human lives across State lines?
Never heard so much rambling about nothingness when the questions were very direct. 🥱🥱🥱🥱
Wonder how Brett feels being lied directly to his face.
She blamed trump in all question
Why do they always leave out the part in the bill “Trump killed” was going to give 100% amnesty?  Edit: Also where’s the policy? The BS talking points and lyrical acrobatics doesn’t lead a country, save my taxes, reduce my taxes, keep insurances affordable and streets safe.
Why did the “border bill” include billions on funding for Ukraine?  I’m glad it failed
What’s her obsession with Donald?
how can i cross ilegally throu mexico can anyone hook me up
Should have asked her about Willie Brown
How many times has she said "Trump"?
So not one single question answered
Wow you can't answer a simple question can you ??
On both sides it’s a mess also why ask a question if you don’t want a answer
Who really wants to listen to her for the next 4 years?
My job is to help pull answers for you. If you're asking where are her responses to being clear, those answers can be found at 2:30, 5:30, 10:00, 12:30, 16:15, 17:15, 18:30, 22:00, and 25:00 until the end of the video. Let me know where else I can be of assistance
The point was the question - “how many people.?”
Listen to this riddle, shes so fake its sick...its amazing no ones went after these sheep yet . They just want to fix it for more mass invasion, not to stop it it dead in its tracks...theres no fixing , ITS CALLED SHUT IT DOWN..
Did you notice? most of the time when she lies, the bigger the lie, the more she waves her hands.
Like reading a book that is nothing but chapter titles. Where is the content ?
Do you need to ask the right questions if they don't want anybody over, why do they give them debit cards and money
As usual Harris you are not answering the questions
Think you’ll ever see Trump on MSNBC?? Or CNN?? Or even 60 minutes on CBS?? Ask yourself WHY…. Could it be he’s a coward??
She fillibusters so much, how she going to abolish it?
She could have rambled for the whole 25 minutes with just answering the very first question. And even then never actually saying anything.
How is this constitutional? She got NOT ONE SINGLE VOTE. How is she even the nominee, how is that constitutional?
Love how she was stalling hoping not to answer too many questions.  She got shredded!😂
She's good at tap dancing around the question, she will never get a vote from me
let's just get straight to the point, -*Not answering the question.... xDDDDDD I can't stand here
First time a good journalist with the courage to ask the right questions and backing checks her
Why can they not say anything without bringing Trump into the conversation?  It's all diversion.
Asking a question and then listening to the answer. Too difficult for a Fox News journalist.
Was this an interview about DT or a chance for KH to take accountability and give proper questions. She must really think about DT 24/7.
Typical women...wont let you finish your question because she doesnt like the question... Shamless weasel..imagine being married to her.
Why WON'T she Answer the Question,,,,,She just goes on and on and on
Wow she's a talk over Queen just get louder and talk even harder to make your point without even answering the question she's a disgrace
Brett TRIED to get her to answer just ONE QUESTION, and she couldn’t do it 😂 She’s so embarrassing…possibly more than Biden.
Where was she when the american people were dying in north Caroline? But she was there for Israel when they got attacked for their own doing
Did she really think this interview can help her?
She dances around all the questions. Such a 🤡
God, this lady is NOT THE Answer she is soo caught up with HATE for trump she can’t Answer simple questions!
She can ever answer a question she has no clue😮
I wonder why they don't ask trump questions like this?????
Did you check her earrings?
Okay tune for an interview from trump where he is asked same questions in the same way- where he is talked over when you don’t like the answer-waiting
She keeps breaking eye contact to search for a lie. Body language doesn't lie.
She can’t answer one GD QUESTION!!!!
Does she ever actually answer a question
Where’d her joy go
She is just totally incapable of answering a question that she doesn't like.
she never answers a question same oldcswamp monster bs
If I was Brad, I would keep asking the same questions until she gives a number!
Show me on this map where Donald Trump hurt you 😅
Hey...so did she say something? Because i tried to follow this blubbering and just couldnt figure out if something was ACUTALLY said
Fox “News” agenda: 1) Ask a question 2) Don’t allow the person being interviewed to answer the question.  3) Interrupt and over talk constantly.  😑🙄
Wish he asked her what is her plan for the economy?
Anybody notice she is wearing the same earrings from her debate with Trump?
When are we gonna learn the person we put in the Whitehouse for 4-8yesrs is not as important as the people we send to congress for 25-30. Term limits now!
CamelTeeth Harris just will not answer a question.
Which question did she actually answer ?
How do you know when she is lying ??   ................................she is talking.
Is she using the same ear piece used on her debate with Trump? I guess she needed someone whisper in her ears.
How does Harris not see what they did with the immigration failure?
Easy to identify the problem.  Where are the republican solutions?  As an independent voter where are the solutions?  Brett does a good job pointing out the problems.  Easy work.
How would Kamala Harris fix the immigration problem?  She hasn't done anything about it for the past three years and nine months.
Running Scared. And still not answering the Questions 😅
Kamala we want to hear the question being asked. Very rude to keep cutting off the interviewer constantly looking like a child throwing a fit that she can't finish her run on sentence. She always does this
If Kamala cant talk to Bret, and can't talk to Joe Rogan, how on Earth will she be able to talk to Putin???
She's trying to protect her campaign by dodging questions yet it would probably help her campaign to give real answers and actually admit fault.
Did anyone count the number of interruptions from Bret?
wow where has her plan been for the last 4 years nowhere
Why does every question to her on her policy agenda  switches to a lie about Trump?
Why was the interview so short? Did her handlers shut it down?
Why does he keep asking why half the country supports Trump? How should she know? The whole other half of the country is puzzled.
Harris walked into trap after trap, being completely and utterly destroyed every time, and she wants to lead this country?
Why does she deserve to be the usa president? Has she proved she is qualified?
She completely dodged the first question
Was this scripted? She used her same speaking points from her tallow to only talk about Donald trump n how horrible he is and how in her world no one likes him 🙄 give me a break this was a perfect time n place to answer all your critics like actually give more detail into your supposed “plans” we keep hearing about without detail. Or how bout you speak about your self more then your opponent, I get it your opponent is going to be brought up but don’t make all your answers about him n how “bad” he is n lie about what he has said 🙄
She is a disgusting person!!! She is just like any other liberal, refuses to answer the question and blames everything on Trump. This is her opportunity to shine and she again failed miserably.
WHATHELL ARE WE SEEING??? Retardationationonsenseenowhenoughumansweretardedemocrats🤔🤨😑🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
she can’t EVER answer a question straight. she deflects and obfuscates.
What the f did I just watch...
Give me a break!!! Answer the question Comrade Kamala instead of ovididing!!! Soooo fake!!!yes let's blame everyone else!!! Give me a break!!!
Such a simple question and she gets flustered in the first three minutes. She can't word salad her way out of failure.
Omg I just wanna punch her on the face over and over....jesus just answer one question...she is so dumb 😂😂😂
Why did you cut the parts that were not convenient for you?
Hey Kamala what about the last 3.5 years?? Can you explain that? Where have you Been up until 2 months ago? Step aside mam We have someone that did an amazing job
she was the last person in the room  Hmmmmm
If she is willing to talk, why in the hell would you cut her off?!?!?! Someone dropped the ball big time!!!
Why did Kamala agree to get steamrolled by fox news?
As a citizen of another country, I wonder, is this woman the best the Democrats have to offer? seriously?  She can't answer ONE question properly
All these Hollywood actors cant give her lessons on how to act? Lol shes a mess
I have always had an issue with her diction and speech and its only now that i realise she is trying to speak like and Present like Obama..like wow😮😮😮😮...does she have an authentic bone at all??
She keeps talking about all these plans but what are them plans?????🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Kinda weird that Scamala has enough money to buy different jewelry but she always wears those same earrings 🤔
She cannot be president for the simple fact she has to argue with every single question he asks.
I appreciate the interviewer actually trying to get her to answer a question and not just continue to let her get away with just saying she's from the middle class and never answer the question.
She's a CUNextTuesday. Listen to her go into a world salad in order to avoid the question.
Fox News started with misinformation- fox is it a news source? What a joke
Kamala is really stupid, worst, idiot VP in US history!  Can’t even answer straight from the simple question! . that's why its supporters are also idiot
Why do women in these positions continue to wear shoulder pads…..
How is she not in prison for treason? All she did was lie, gaslight, and blame Trump for what her administration and what she did.😡🤬
Breat Baiar or whatever his name is talking about filibuster lol guy was talking over harris and wouldn’t let her answer the question. That’s the MAGA style of interviewing. Be rude and obnoxious
How can I get these 30 minutes back?
She can't even answer the first question, I'm glad he interrupted because he was already seeing through her bs moves.
It's funny that he takes more time to ask a question compared to the time he gives her to answer before interrupting her 🤦🏼‍♂️ low level of professionalism of the interviewer
Does she not realize that we all just watched her not answer a single question she was asked with a direct clear answer?
Finally real questions and her real salads. How is she not prepared at this point to defend herself.
When she gets cornered with a legitimate question she blames it on Trump. What a Loser.
When she gets cornered with a legitimate question she blames it on Trump. What a Loser.
Anyone who wants to vote for her after that, i seriously question your intelligence.
Anyone noticed she is wearintg the same bluetooth earings as she did douring the debate? 😮
What did she say? I heard rambling and self doubt
She doesn’t know the question???? Bad
Please just answer the question, don't need stories
Still waiting for her to answer a question
Answer the damm questions
Kamala is really stupid. Can’t even answer straight from the simple question! . that's why its supporters are also idiot
Foxnews is asking the wrong questions on issues where we all know Kamala is losing already from the polls. Foxnews should have covered the topics where Kamala is winning so they can try to bring her down.
This woman cannot answer a single question with a straight answer. Trump lives rent free in her head. She has no sense of responsibility or respect for American citizens, victims, and victims families. The most twisted, lying, corrupt politician I’ve ever seen. All she wants is power, not what is best for our country. SMH. Crazy.
What did the guy do to his face?
She's actually being interviewed 😮.
Every question he asked was intended to put her on the defensive. He refused to let her answer by interrupting her responses.
What are democrats gonna run on when Trump I no longer running? He lives in her head rent free.
Are we all seeing the same thing here?
Since when is transgender surgery medically necessary?
What kind of vp dont anwser question
What. Would. YOU. Do. Differently.  Than. YOU. Have. Been. Doing. For. Three. Years! JUST! ANSWER! THE! QUESTION! THIS IS NOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP!!!!
The questions were great but he overtalked her way too much.
Why do you think people trust Trump more than you?  No answer.....
How is it medically necessary to get your peepee chopped off?
She purposely takes 10 plus minutes to try to answer a simple question to stall!!!
Is she high or having a stroke?! My gosh I can't believe she's gotten this far!!
She is taking too long to answer the question
She now has 2 ideas. 25k to new home buyers, and 50k to small businesses.... why is she waiting?
Did she even answer one question...
9:24 good question by Bret Baier and a polished response by an attorney who is schooled in the art of lying and twisting words. We don't need a lawyer in the WH.
I don't understand why the Biden administration isn't in prison for treason.
Hmm the last decade… who were the last four terms? Obama Biden, Obama Biden, Trump pence, Biden Harris…
Not a single question was answered with sincerity. When there should have been a simple yes or no, there was a whole lot of nothing.
So unclear
He is very rude, interferes one second after asking a question
Why she be lieing
It’s Trumps fault… I can’t answer a question with anything else. This woman is dumb!
my boss asked me why I hadn't completed any tasks that he gave me these past 4 years.... I blamed it on someone who hasn't been in the job those 4 years then asked for a promotion, pay rise and promised if I was given both then I would complete the jobs...... who am I?
Why don’t they introduce just one item on a bill?  What we aren’t told is WHY it was rejected
Dem voters need to ask themselves why Trump countlessly welcomes challenging interviews like this and why this hardly ever happens with their side and now we know why. Look how easily and quickly they fall apart when pushed back on.
She can't simply answer the questions.
He is a terrible journalist.  He asks a question then she gets three words in and he answers it himself.  Continues to interrupt her. Why interview her? Seems to just want to make his own points. This audience just wants to get some gotcha moments. I would have walked out.
Ma’am can you please answer a single question
She NEVER answers a question yes/no.
She demands to be allowed to answer the questions but continues to dodge the question when she's given time. Does she really think anyone is buying her tactical lies
O poor lady  you cannot just answer a question and own up to you have failed
Bret great questions and answers!
Answer the question!!!!!
1st question not answered and the point was 2 million or 20 million which one
Do she think Americans are stupid??😠
Why would she do this😂😂😂
What a masterclass in dodging questions , failing to take responsibility and blaming someone else . Kudos .
I would like her to find any video of Trump actually saying he would use the US military against Americans. All conjecture on her part.
And will it be Trump's fault or her own when she loses the election on November 5?
Does she know how many years are in a decade? 😆 🤣
How do you run on a reform platform when you’re literally the incumbent?
Nice earings Scamala! Who's on the other end of that ear piece?
Typical lawyer. Never answer a question that proves your guilty.
My son when he was 5 years old could answer questions better than this thing!
Bro she literally triggers my ADHD so bad like can h please just answer the question without all the dodging
If the country is so tired of the finger pointing....Why does Harris continue to do it?? Hmmm
No straight answers
You won't answer the question and constantly contend you're not interested in answering the question because you have no answer for the question other than you were a terrible vice president and a Marxist you have no business in our government especially High office
Wow Vance can handle actual questions better than she can and she's the VP! Wow what a moron.
Can she talk if she sat on her hands and did not wave them around?
How stupid is this lady ! Can’t even answer a simple question, mind blowing with lies and nonsense propaganda.for a political point. Sad day for America. Let’s vote for dumb dunb . To save us , what a joke
Who is going to pay for all of this kamala? Our country is broke!!!!
She plays the blame game on trump for every other question
She said nothing over and over... hmm
Why don’t you treat her like the other media outlets treat Trump. Don’t let her talk talk talk
When is it medically necessary to change someone’s gender? Low IQ bs
When is Trump going on CNN? 😅
I honestly think I can answer these questions so much better.
Could she not even answer honestly the question about Biden's health? Not a hard question really. Too much blaming someone who is not in office, and too many "non answers". But thanks for the interview! And for trying, to get her to answer.
Why the hell did he keep interrupting her? She did a great job. She didn't even bring up Hannibal Lecter.
Dude is this for real!?
She just keeps avoiding questions by rambling about other subjects trying to change the subject at hand like she can’t even give a solid straight forward answer when being questioned about stuff she’s done but yet decides to go off topic and ramble about how Donald Trump did this or that and won’t take responsibility for any of her actions current or past, she is trying too hard 😂
I wonder if she was as lousy of a lawyer as she is a vice president
Why won't she answer the question.
Will Trump show the  guts to be questioned like this by any unfriendly channel ? If yes, he has a chance..
Does she really believe what she says?
She got drilled and she was lost like a child who did not how to answer a single question!
Bret’s Google search history has a lot of “How to look more like Ronald Reagan” queries.
Sad to watch. Is this America leadership?
If you see he did not ask her about abortion. He only asked what he thought he would get points on
Answer the FKN question!
I can't even make it past the first question of the interview 😢
Great journalism here!❤ Direct straight forward questions with yes or no answers.   No running away kalama !!!!!!
Omg she is such an idiot, how did she ever get a law degree?
Wait a minute he never went after peaceful protesters she's the one that encouraged burning looting and rioting and she bailed them out what are hypocrite
What about the man your cuty put in prision who is now a millionaire because you locked him up illegally while you kackled?
She has the republican warmongers on her side, i wonder why. Big money in these democrat proxy wars
So, he asks her questions and doesn't let her answer them without interrupting her.  MAGA laps it up as though this is a big win.
How does it feel being called out by people who disagree with you Kamala?
What in the botox crisis is going on
He was trying to get her to smile. Kept interrupting and was hoping she'd smile at the joke of an interview. Fair questions. Lame interviewer.
What a JOKE this lady is.  She WILL NOT ANSWER any question!!!  Hahah.
The longer this interview goes the worse it is for her. By the end she can’t answer a direct question
She can't answer a simple question without going into her written speeches.  Americans want answers not rambling.
Again Trying to dance around the questions. Glad to see her being called out.
Finally she gets a real interview with real questions. Good on Brett for just asking the questions. She’s didn’t answer anything directly but it gave us a good preview. What a train wreck she’d be.
Just answer the questions.
How could anyone vote for her?
Why does this cow keep trying to shift the narrative to Donald Trump? She needs to learn how to answer the question and not deflect.
They are the ones trying to lock Trump up?🤷🏻‍♂️
Where was this Kamala hiding during the debate 😅😂😂😂 the reporter had a job to do and he accomplished mission
Why is Brett always interrupting since the get go? It's kinda weird . 😮
Literally did not answer a single question…
Did anyone do a Trump count?
More word salad. Just answer the question but she can't!!
She is getting good with the ear piece the time she takes to answer the question and how she looks off to gather the ear piece communication
What kind of drug did she take? And anyway, whose speech is slurred? That of Donald Trump or that of Kamala Harris?
Who do you think would be better to build a strong economy? The guy who built a billon dollar business or the Women who slept her to the top ?
Ask her about the hit-and-run accident😢 ask her about the lady she put in jail because her daughter was in the hospital😢 ask her about the guy that spent 7 years in jail that was innocent and she held paperwork that proved it😢😢😢 I don't understand why you're being so easy she hasn't answered one question yet
Never will answer a question. This is one big train wreck!! No more..TRUMP/VANCE 2024 🇺🇸
How come she can do a Fox interview, but Trump will not do 60 Minuets?
This is just as useless as a congressman hearing. Ehats the point in questions when u are not answering anything.
Although she’s a liar, please let her finish the question.
Isn’t this the “hateful rhetoric” the left is tired of????
She never answers a question. Talks and says nothing. Burdened again. Shes like a parrot.
Why are we letting this happen.
Never sure why Democrats don't take credit for an amazing economy. Lowest unemployment, Lowest welfare, highest stock market, etc.  Inflation - caused by COVID - is now under control. And many successful bills to make our economy stronger.
We finally get to see her have to answer REAL questions... And all she does is talk in circles
What is Her Greatest Accomplishment since she took office??
This is what happens when your asked serious questions and not soft balls like the useless left outlets 😂😂😂😂
How can you look at her more then a minute
When is the funeral?
I donunderstand how she was a prosecutor when she can't answer the question directed. Harris goes off into lala land giving answers.
Who is this interviewer, really the worst I've ever seen. The questions are actually ok but he never lets her finish. Not one single time.
The fkng point is KAMALA!!!!! WE WANT YOU TO ACTUALLY ANSWER THE FKNG QUESTION!!!!!! IS THAT ENUF FOR YOU????;!!!!
Why didn't Bret correct her lies about what Trump meant and has specifically pointed as to whom "the enemy of within" is?? He never once said it was the American People! He named Shifty Shift, bad immigration, corrupt politicians, but never American citizens! I can't believe she was allowed to spew those lies here..
I want to see footage of her actually at the border only took 3.8 yrs to get her down there. Video proof or it didn't happen 🤔
The same earrings!?
How in the world is it a close tie with her and Trump? Who is voting for her? Are they deaf?
NEVER ANSWERED A QUESTION,ABSOLUTELY EVIL ,WE HAVE STARMER EXACTLY THE SAME EVIL PERSON 🥵🥵🥵
He asks a question , then talks over Her 🤔🤔
Is it just me or she is just like Janet in Friend series at parallel world? 😂
Is it just me or she is just like Janet in Friend series at parallel world? 😂
lol this fox host should let someone finish a question instead of trying to anger the person he’s interviewing. Jesus, this is why fox is a terrible news network
Finally she's asked real questions...and what's she do. Uses the "same old at book"..lol
🎉🎉HONEST QUESTION- after watching this interview did you change or make up your mind? What did it for you? BOTH SIDES- be kind 🎉🎉
Ask the question. Did you get it wrong 5 years ago
What happened to her other accent?
She refuses to ever answer a single direct question.
Interesting how she doesnt like being cut off while answering questions. But all the left wing interviewers have been interrupting Trump for years. The difference is, this interviewer was just trying to get an actual answer out of her. Instead of word salads.  And left wing interviewers interviewing Trump, are trying to force him to say a certain answer. The cut him off to force him to give the answer they want. This guy just cut her off to so he could ask the question again because the answer she was giving literally was so far away from the question asked.
Harris really knows how to avoid the question.  This administration caused the border issue yet will not accept it’s their doing.   She does not care about the US one bit.
Jesus, I am only two minutes into this and it's unwatchable. If you're going to ask a question, let them answer. This is supposed to be an interview, not a debate. If you want to fact check her, wait until she finishes her answer then you can ask a follow-up question. It's like this guy's never done an interview before.
Shall we Just dance right on around the question without yes or no Answers ❓😟
Can someone do a search on how many cases she prosecuted personally, as a first chair?
The only thing she’s skilled at is avoiding the question she’s a absolute dumb a55
Does your employer hire felons? Why would you want one for POTUS?
Is anybody considered how angry she got just from simple questions?
The enemy within is you and your machine?
I’m sorry that her family is going through that, sincerely, but….🤦🏼‍♂️There should be no “but” in a sincere apology
Affordable housing… how the hell is she going to make that happen… how come it’s taking the dems so long to do this 😂
As she plays political games and does not never answer the question
Why did she agree to go to fox?😂😂😂
Mute her mike so we can here the actual question. All I could hear was Trump this and Trump that. She absolutely did not want to talk about herself and her policies and what she stands for. She has been clear.
So madam VP, what are the plans??????
Answer the freaking question just one
It's amusing to the point of harlious 😂🤣, reading some of the predictably negative comments being expressed about Harris interview.  You MAGA loons and Fox devotees , are such tribalized dullards. You accused Harris, not answering questions and lying about trump- not giving examples of her alleged lying. Simple question for you MAGA loons: since when do care about politicians not answering questions and lying 🤥?   Trump consistently evade interview questions, or he walks out on the interview, or  revert to calling the interviewer nasty names. Trump constantly lies🤥.. example, immigrants are eating dogs and cats in Springfield, government's inaction responding to the most recent hurricane disasters, etc... Before Harris open her mouth, y'all already made your tiny mind up.   Kudos for Harris agreeing to Fox interview. 👍🏼👌🏼👏🏼 She held her own.  Your Messiah Trump is on progressive cognitive decline and has uncontrollable flatus problems. He avoids interviewers that will not enable him, like Hannity and Ingram.   Fact is MAGA loons, your 💯 hypocrites !!
She is still not answering questions craziness
Great job with questions. Kamala you are not getting promoted. You are too dumb to be our president.
Bret: *literally any question*  Kamala:  yeah, but Donald Trump....
So uncomfortable interview this is the first time I see a reporter grill a democrat. Thank you Bart
Am I the only one seeing a dodge ball talking????
He asked her questions like she was the president. And he is rude and interrupting her constantly. Typical fox BS.
Thank You Brett for asking the hard questions and staying on point not ramblings of vice president kamala🙏May God Bless You in all You do 🙏💛
How about asking what else was attached to the immigration bill?
Still hasn't answered a question. 👹
Who would actually vote for her?
The way se keeps talking whiteout awnings one single question is sooooooooo goooooood. I love it. Thanks Kemala for reelect Donald Trump in this interview
Its the same issues as we have in the UK.  Cost of living and immigration. Illegal immigration is a huge issue in Europe just now. On a separate note, ask a question then actually listen to the answer. So irritating to have interviewees constantly spoken over. Challenge yes, but let us hear what they are saying.
Just wish she could answer 1 question!!!!!!!!! God Bless Us All❤🙏
Firet question is straight to the point
She never answered the question, with a clear answer that made sense. She just complained and deflected the responsibility. She is not sorry for the mistakes. She’s lying to herself and us!
Are people voting for her?
Correct me if I'm wrong,  but isn't it the democrats going after a republican?
I’m not finished dancing around the question Brett!
Her website explains nothing
She is really good at diverting the question, and it is very obvious 🙄
This guy is just asking a question, interrupting/talking over her and then answering it himself. Super unprofessional
He asked about threats to America not anyone else
I wish she would kust answer a question.....
When a TV show host asks a question they need to actually listen to the answer. Harris had more to say but Baier kept stepping on her responses. That's the difference between a journalist and a TV show host.
Anyone see the cockroach?
What about your donors,china/Russia? No threat there huh?
She can't answer a single question
Good Lord! Bret is attacking VP Harris about transgender issues??? This is a non-issue.
Anybody trust this phony lying B!TСН???
She never get to the point of answering the simple question..
Did she answer any of these questions?
When did it become a crisis?  When the American people called me on it.  Oh ya an election .
He needed another hour to keep on asking questions but quite surprisingly he did push her and she is a joke
Is it me, or is she already aging faster?
She just avoids answering his questions 😆
Can she just get to the point and answer a simple question?   It’s not that hard sheesh …
Notice the forehead? Those are "how am I going to answer this?" lines.   I love this guy. He's not going to her not answer the questions.
Wow, first time I see FOX produce some hard questions. Funny they don’t do the same with Donald, and fact check his answers
So Brett asks if 50% of American voters are dump or stupid for supporting Trump?  As I reflect on that question from a safe distance of 9000 or so miles, I am thinking the answer is a definite yes.  America you've been had.
What an idiot. Evades  answering direct questions 😡
He cuts her off all the time. Is that normal?
Are those the same 80 policies that were copied from Biden's website? Is that the page turning she is talking about?🤔
I thought abortion was a state by state decision, why can’t health and education be state by state? Oh Fox you messed that one!
The enemy?
She never answers a question…ever.
did uall fact check her lies🤔🤔🤮😡
Every. Single. Question.... "Sure, we have been bad, but Trump is running for President..."
Deflecting to Trump when you can’t answer a question. I’ll vote for Trump thank you.
I dont think she has the ability to actually answer a question.
So, the first thing that this guy does is ask a question, and then when she starts to answer, he interrupts her and switches subjects. Yeah, that is fair and balanced.
17:37 she still didn’t answer the question about the 79 percent of the people saying the country going the wrong direction.
So tired of this cackling women ducking, diving questions. All questions have simple answer she beats around the bush avoiding questions. Do you owe an apology? Feeling awful is not yes!
Imagine orange trump dump being asked these questions. SHM
This went worse than some of Trump's debates. How about ask the question and let her talk then ask again if she didnt answer my guy! Your supposed to act like a reporter not like you're also running for president. Anyways she did what she always does dodge and redirect lol hopefully people can see through her crap.
Why is Hamas still holding American hostages
If she knows how to, why hasn't she ?
Does she not have any other ear rings?
I need to know more about the significance of the passage of time because I just wasted almost half an hour of my life
What about the Reddick from the Dems media.
She will not answer the question
How come she can never SAY her policies ??? We gotta go read an 82 page book now? 😂
Refreshing to see this! Actual questions!!!!
If this was a test, she scored 0. No question answered
This is so bad. She can’t answer a question.
this guy asked the dumbest questions and kept interrupting her and didn’t respond to replubitards killing the bipartisan border bill. what a loser
Does she not own another pair of earrings...
She can’t answer one question. Not one. Terrible speaker.
He did not let her answer the questions fully before interupting her with the next question. Rude & more importantly it does not give her the opertunity to explain or defend. If you ask a question then you should let her answer. I learned not to interupt ppl & listen to each others viewpoint
First real interview
Brett you better ask softer question Harris will have the FBI Arrest you for asking Real Questions
Manipulative, gaslighting, can't answer a question straight, blaming others.. 🤔 Google that!!
She can’t answer the question properly…brain dead! God  Bless America
What infastructure
why is she trying to act like shes conservative now?
Q: How r u Kamala A: Trump Q: How you doing  A: Trump Q: How's your day A: Trump
She cannot answer a question without mentioning Trump.
She couldn’t directly answer one question. Deflect, deflect, deflect.
does Kamalotoe know she is VICE PRESIDENT? and not Trump? after 4 years in office everything is Trump's fault?
lol now I see why people make fun of Fox news. I’m less than 4 minutes in and he won’t even let her answer the question before constantly interrupting.
When can I see the Trump interview on CNN?
Why did they change what was working? She is nutz.
It's really interesting to see how Harris handles questions from people that aren't on board with her.  Brett did a solid job pushing her on these things, and she crumbled. Brett kept it pretty darn neutral too, and she struggled!
What’s the number of immigrants?
He asked if she owed the family an apology and she shook her head no
26 minutes of a guy trying to get person to answer one question.  i've seen more goals scored at a hockey game.
If you live in pa and vote republican please explain 1 policy that he made that benefit you please answer ill wait im sure yall cannot answer
Why did she sound like she uttered "assassination" when she said "as a nation"?.😮
She never answered Brett's opening question despite his efforts to get back to it. If I were to describe Kamala's answers in one word, that word would be "evasive."
Let me be clear, I can tell if she is just that stupid?  Or if she is just that stupid!🤡
Did she EVER CALL THE PARENTS TO THE YOUNG GIRLS ?????
Notice that shes wearing the same Bluetooth earrings as debate lol
She NEVER answers a question! America CANNOT have her !
she still never answered a question
Finally, a journalist asking real questions and holding her accountable. Great job Brett
Did any questions get answered?
I am curious how Kamala is going to be or if she will be seen the day after this interview
Am i missing something or did she answer a single thing ??
If she changes her mikd from what she thought 5 years ago, how many more times will she change? Do not trust people changing their mind every other week...
That Moron just can not answer one question. It is brain dead!
How can the name Donald Trump be mentioned so much in a Kamala Harris interview. She never focuses on telling us what she will do and how in detail. We’re not idiots we also understand politics. Geeze
The queen of dodging, evading and sidestepping questions
Does anyone else’s blood boil when she talks….lies?
what a fake corrupt lady, never answering a question and always deflecting the important issues.
Very brave of her to go into the Fox den! Did the fox get the chicken or did she just make it out with all her feathers?
Anyone know how many times she mentioned DJT? I forgot to count. And, as great as Brett was, I'd choke myself if I  had to hear her ignorance again today.
Isn't getting to the point answering the question ?
Why is he interrupting her all the time?
She dance around every question. I'm tired of her crap, blaming trump,  when she was in charge
Was she drinking? She is an embarrment to the USA.
Disappointed by Brett's questioning.  Not straightforward or concise.  If you have hard facts that you want to challenge a response to, set it up at the beginning-don't make them into gotcha curveball.  As a liberal listening to this, there really were very sobering points to consider but too much of it was caught and undermined by the clanging.  I really respect Brett and I don't think this was his A game.
Asked her what’s the biggest threat to America and she spends the entire time talking about Israel
Let her answer the question man!
What has the Biden Administration done that’s improved your life?
Not a single straight answer was given in this interview
Kamel-toe is so stupid she is unable to answer a single question and is not even aware of how rediculous she sounds and looks.
This is so hard to watch… all she can do to answer questions is not answer them, like what kind of an answer is, I’m going to follow the law
That was so painful to watch! She danced around every single question.
13:11 Interesting... how is she knowing about a recession in the middle of 2025? I haven't read that anywhere. Like 2008 in this case as we are in a very similar position like then with the rates and the way of handling it. If anybody have a link to articles about it that it will actually happen, please link it so my own info is updated in that case.
Hahaha the fist time Kamalas been asked a real question. He actually got Cackles McKneepads to say "You have to take responsibility for what happens in your administration".
He didnt ask about a military. He asked WHY IS HE BEATING YOU IN SWING STATES
First proper interview, without magic bluetooth earings / soft questions vs prepped questions. Had to be called off, corner threw in the towel 😂
She can't answer a question
how many plastic surgeries did the guy have ?
This is how UK politicians answer questions, never answer them constantly deflect them and blow smoke… the UK has fallen hard and has been sold to big corporations and companies and now the people in the country are no longer important. The preview of this exists be careful
Trump’s behavior has shifted notably in recent years. Some analysts suggest that his actions are influenced not only by age but also by the pressure from legal troubles and political challenges. Some argue that Trump’s diminishing cognitive state could become a critical issue, especially since he lacks anyone in his inner circle willing to confront him about these apparent declines.  These mental and behavioral shifts are increasingly becoming part of the public discourse, with experts cautioning that these signs raise serious questions about his fitness to lead.
Did they not try to lock him up?
The point is , you never answer the question
So typical democrat/leftist, interrupting and raising voice. Doesn't always listen a question before start to give a word salad answer. So destructive woman and party.
She failed to answer every question presented to her.  She scored 100% Vote wisely nov5 people
Good for you for trying to hold her accountable and get her to honestly answer a question!! She proves once again she is dishonest and skirts around the issues because she has no clue!!
Anybody noticed the same earnings / earphones  she was wearing at the debait??? Hmm 🤔🤔🤔
I swear she CANNOT answer a question clearly and plainly.
Would she ever give a straight answer to a question
FINALLY, someone asks her a real question! Thank you !
This bit*ch is just avoiding answering tough questions. Totally incompetent
Finally... Real question.... Finally a real interview....
She’s not very good is she? 😮
“Why does border patrol say you’re too blame and they endorse djt?” “Well looks they work a lot and are stressed.”   …
Why is Brett ignoring the fact that Trump killed the border deal?
The interviewer is so rude, he asks questions but he doesn’t let her to answer….he keeps talking over her.
Why didn’t Trump pull together a bipartisan deal during his 4 years.
Trump held town hall anwered like 5 question then stood there for 30 mins swaying to music...hmm
Brett did an outstanding job with his substantive questions on the real issues!
She can't even answer a single question lol
This woman answers no questions.  She lets her hate for others cloud her ability to be respectful & answer basic questions.  Lets pray for her
Typical Politico...talk talk and not answer the question... I hope America has better upright ppl in politics than her.Edit..how many times did she say Trump...deflecting is a way of not answering a question.
Respect Brett for not slapping this ignorant woman for her reluctance to answer question or take responsibility for her miserable failures.
She dont want to answer any of the question, or she just have listening comprehension issue
BUT SHE DOESNT ANSWER THE REAL QUESTION.
she didn't answer one question
How would she answer a yes or no question?  Just yes, or no Kam?  She's ridiculous.
Where has she been the past 3 years???  She was as silent as a mouse
What an angry stupid woman, she did not answer one question she was asked. Oh my God America if this woman in elected you are done.
Wth was that? She's a joke.
In the last decade.   So 6 years democrats have been in power..... ?
When I run for office:  acknowledge the question, repeat the question as the answer, deflect, blame the opponent, lather, rinse, repeat….
her strategy was very clear here ....waste as much time as possible to answer less question
would be nice if she actually answered a question
You shut up and answer questions you
This woman has to be a joke we’ll all wake up from?!
I mean really?  Does he know Kamala isn't President?  She's pretty much powerless as VP.  Tie Breaker of Senate is the only power she had and designated survivor.  Trying to make her say bad things about Biden, not cool.  That's all this was, attack her on things you know she had no power of.  Snake.
Who tf is this clown
What leaders???
How does Donald get away with such bad behavior and Kamala doesn't? That's all you need to think about.
“Let me speak and finish the question.” “Ok, can you please do it in sentences that has structure and context and without brining up Donald Trump?”
Why has she never talked about her accomplishments as VP,  she keeps bringing up irrelevant experiences and living in the past
Wow  What a specialist at evasion of the questions
He wouldn't even let her answer the questions. How pathetic!
She keeps deflecting the question and can’t give the right answers.
Did they edit this interview to make her look better?
Loved her face when he asked about Biden mentality. 😮
Answer the questions. Omg
Surprised she agreed to be grilled like this.
Just answer the question!!!!!
Question from a swiss guy: is  israel a state of the USA or why does your country have to defend them?
What about FREE healthcare for AMERICAN CITIZENS and FREE EDUCATION?
Haha is he fact checking her and not letting her finished? That's interesting because when CNN did the same to Trump during the debate Fox News was complaining that Trump was debating 3 people (her and 2 moderators) instead of just her. Now this moderator is doing exactly the same to her what CNN was doing to Trump and I guess now it's OK? Fox News are just bunch of hypocrites 🙄.
I wished they had more time so he could give her the opportunity to speak and then challenge her on everything she says and ask her some tougher questions, cause this was also a softball.
No plan on the needs of American people? You mean the same ones of yours? Wheres the specific accountability? GTFOH lady
He asks her question after question and she dodges every single one with Donald Trump this and Donald Trump that. Can't she just answer the question? 79% of Americans feel this country is going in the wrong direction and that points to the last 3 1/2 years, why is that? and she has no answer.
The journalist is a disgrace, he asks a question and he never let her answer, the interview clearly was for scoring points and not solving the issue
Is womansplaining a thing?
She can’t answer a question she turns it to Trump.
She having a hard time answering the question just like always
Answer one question please at least one.
Now with this question here when did you find out about Joe Biden's mental capacity here is the answer to her question and it is not answered she gaslighted it like she does everything else
Wow why does he keep interrupting her?
She speaks in riddles 😂
90 Executives order reversed????
Kamala answer the question, stop dodging the questions! This lady is so unfit to be president, she's not a leader, she's a follower..😬
And she still won't answer the questions... Redirecting is not an answer...
For the first question, she couldn’t answer but word salad. I’m getting so annoyed to listen to Kamala. I can’t wait for the election to be over and Trump is back the WH.
Why did you allow her to wear those bluetooth earrings???
what... the full interview 30 mins?
She can not answer even a simple question. This is what liars do.
Kamala should answer the question. Period. She shouldn't be bamboozling herself, waiting for prompting 😅😅😅😅
Has she forgotten that Democrats have been in charge for 12 of the last 16 years?!?
Those people were released from detention. What has that got to do with staff numbers on the border?
What a poor  interviewer.  He asked a question and then talked over the answer/response.  It was terrible and very unprofessional.
Anyone else spend the whole time looking at her earrings?  Lol
Is that all she managed to do??!
What are you turning the page from??  What a million dollar question looks like...
Softball questions as they were posted. It’s a game for Brett. He should know it’s a war against evil. What a tragedy she was able to get by  with NO accountability!!!!!!  Fox is quickly becoming a dishonest media.
She keeps blaming everything on trump yet these past 4 years she’s been vice president ?
First question in and she’s already defensive
6:30 complete lack of self awareness or desperate attempt at gaslighting?
She cant answer a question. I'm just going to filibuster.
I can’t trust someone that can’t  answer direct questions! Just Makes my blood boil
Where is American support for our Americans???
Trump Trump Trump that's all she knows to cop out of every question this is disgusting
Did they inspect her earrings this time? And are those the only earrings she owns?
It's a non-answer every single time. Take a stance on at least one thing, goodness.
How do people like this sleep at night?
I’m tired of the projection, she keeps talking about Trump, what is she going to do as president?
He let her weasel out of questions!!!  He should have stopped her and made her answer YES or NO!!!!  He let her trurn everything to blaiming Trump.
What a idiot , dance around the question , she is a murderer
Why is always DT?? As if Trump is the president now.
She has done nothing in the 3 1/2 years. What will she do in the next 4 years?
Finally real world questions on the spot !! Deer in the headlights 👀😭😭
She was toasted. Real questions from a Real journalist!
Amazing interview but she didnt answer anything.
Why doesn't this woman answer direct questions...if your not transparent being interviewed how are you out here trying to sell to the ppl BS and expect them to believe or trust you....smh we want thr truth and answers to why you and  Biden failed the taxpayers Americans
How did she EVER become a DA?
She refused to answer every question.
Is she couldn't do her job for 4 years because of trump, how will she be able to do it the next 4?
Most of her answers are hearsay.....Not even admissable in court of law and yet she was a lawyer.....
Madam Vice President, what is 2x2? Well, first off let me talk about....
She's a disaster and didn't answer his questions
Good job, Brett. All you needed to do was ask good questions, and you did
Finally a reporter that will ask her real questions......
Thank you Fox News for posting the full interview on your channel. Do you really need to make that much money off of your replays that you have programmed in this many ads? The “commercial breaks” are worse than watching your station on cable.
So she only has 1 set of earrings? She is wearing the exact same earrings in every interview. Anyone else notice that?
She dodges answering questions like Trump dodges bullets
No fun😂 ask her if she was raised in a middle class family
Be honest guys... Is this a sketch show?
She is so dumb that she can't even answer a question, she just keeps attacking Trump, you are just pathetic
I'm only ten seconds in.  Man, from a body language POV, she should not be sitting in that guarded position, arms crossed over "lady area."  That's not an open honest posture. Does she have zero staff prepping her, does she not listen ot what? That's body language 101.
Why haven’t you done it? You should have done it already, what are you waiting for. You are the ones that waited till now to run on it, hypocrites
Why is she always crying voice.😅
When will DUMP go on MSNBC?
Let us have the same half hour with a questionnaire  using the same pressure with the great Trump.
Omg,, who in the planet is going vote for her?
What happened to her Jamaican, southern, Latino, etc accents?
Wow. She can not answer a direct question. I do not think she understands she's been in charge for almost 4 years.
About 10 minutes to avoid answering a simple question....
How could somebody yam around this much and not even answer a question
She is using trump style in answering questions. Looks like she become more cconfidence in  speaking now than before. Well trained by her subordinates how to give answers to the interviewer.  Cant beat Trump
hard wrap why? keep going for 2 more hours
I thought she was a person of colour,  not perfectly clear?
Answer the question
But the ast 4yrs who was is charge? Trump or biden harris?
Why does be LOOK like that? The plastic surgery is cartoonish. He cant even emote.
What happens when you let a 304 in office?
Finally some real questions. And what she get there and do. Lie, deflect and use her hands like we’re stupid
This woman hasn't answered a question in her entire life.   Complete con woman
She was right in the middle of filibustering your question how dare you interpret her to  demand she actually answer the question.
She just does non stop Rambling about diff things to avoid the questions.
I am sure we have seen those ear rings before?
They ask about Bidens mental state and shes talking about Donald trump
How can she continue to lie...
Why does the moderator uses the term "illegal aliens"? This normalizes such language. I'm a scared german woman, that knows the history of her country.
Did it answer a single question?
Why did they stop the construction of the border wall when they took office?
How did the inflation reduction act turn out?
So she now would do things much differently?
Has she EVER created a job from her company? Mmm 🤔 she has no idea
Notice how she can't answer the question straight and honestly
Does she realize her and job wouldn’t need to fix a problem is they never changed trumps policies? Like can someone please shut her up already? Thank good ness there’s only 20day till we don’t gotta hear her same old rehearsed lines.
Hows it feel getting cut off in every questions?
She's going round in circles instead of answering questions
Has Bret Baier already been fired for this outrageous disaster?
Never answers a question because she's a dodgy dodo!
Who has lost their mind.? Biden or Harris, I cannot tell.
Why is she acting like she’s not the 2nd most powerful person in the world?  She can act now America.
How come no one ever mentions that the Border Bill would have sent $80B to fortify other countries’ borders and roughly $20B would go to ours with NONE going for our own wall?  How come she keeps getting away with lying about this?
Was he interviewing or debating or really trying to take her down which his candidate failed to do ?
So the guy who brought together RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Elon Musk is the divisive one?
Does he or would he grill trump like this
WHy are they as tough with Orange Julius than with Kamala?
Brett...No longer an ethical newsman! Crappie interview! Ask your full question...and allow the response.  Pure FOX BS!!
Dodging the question as usual. Clueless VP
European here, is it normal in America that the interviewer does not let the interviewed answer?
Has she ever called those families? More patrol to let more in? That's what she wants.
Why didn't fox use a proper investigating reporter rather than the soft ball of BB.
Did she answer 1 question?
Avoiding answering questions, blaming Trump for her policies, stalling time by endless repetitions, slow talk and nodding……🥱
5:03 before trump got involved? If HE had done better at addressing the border, kamala and Joe wouldnt have had to clean up his mess. We were being coted for human right violations under trumps borders
Did someone take an egg beater to this woman's brain?  She is an absolute mess mentally .
Madam vice president, when did you notice joe Bidens decline in cognitive abilities?   Harris: ORANGE MAN BAD 😡
Did anyone notice that she was wearing the same earrings she had on during the debate?
Is she really wearing those earrings with the head phones again?
She always avoids answering the question and tries to blame stuff on Trump. Never answered the question
So at 13:30 why does she say "our plan as president of the United states" and then goes back to saying "I as president"? I think she messed up and said the the quiet part outloud just like biden has been doing lately.
You must answer for your lies!
Finally someone grills this rat
Does she say anything of substance? She just keeps rambling on and on and not saying anything with any substance. Yell that makes you look even more desperate. Kamala you are a Liar!!!!
Why Camella Harris is CRYING here? WHY>? 🤣 LOSER, LIER!  an example of her crying: 8:35 (* and the entire interview)
Nobody knows what she really thinks and wants for the country. She's a special interests puppet, a hollow vessel.
How many times did Bret interrupt and talk over her when she started to make a point? Unwatchable.
Great intervew Brett,  this is the first she's been asked real questions
Which accent is she giving us today…
Host is very rude and unprofessional. You can ask tuff questions without being so  a di.k
How about answering the freakin questions and stop blaming Trump.
Why don't journalists call her out on the disgraceful Biden border "security" bill she keeps bringing up? Less that 17% of the $118 billion went to the actual border with the majority of funds going to Ukraine, Isreal, Gaza and other countries.
20/30 different questions, 0 answers given. Amazing job comrade Kamala. The staff that made the deal with FOX definetely lost their job.😂😂
She’s wearing the exact same earrings she did with the Debate… what are the chances of that
Has anyone else noticed the same "earrings" in this interview, identical to the ones worn at the Debate?
how many minutes did she waste saying nothing on the first question
Bimbling slavering Biden could have handled those questions better .
Have you noticed how she wears the same earrings to the every interview she does? The ones that look veeery similar to the earrings that are in reality a hidden ear piece? :D
Is this woman insane? Does she have the intellect to understand how much damage she's done to herself?
Finally an interviewer who pushes and doesn’t backdown trying to get an answer but she still cant give one😂
Low key is she a robot cause she avoids the question or getting called out. Shits wild af
Too bad, Harris can’t answer a question nor allow the question or to speak the question in its entirely she interrupts she’s rude. She over talks she’s rude. She has no real thought process. She’s not intelligent. She thinks that she wins because she can over talk a polite person, no all it does is prove that she is rude and that she really doesn’t wanna answer the question so she’ll just talk over the question until the polite person gives up.
fresh ideas such as? your experience, your contribution meaning?
what has this to do with trump he not president now they had 3 1/2 years they just made it worse
Just give the number woman. She doesnt know???🤔
This is his interview. Be quiet and listen to his questions and give an actual answer!
For the American people? What has she and her administration done for the American people?
brett: did you notice bidens congnitive decline? harris: i think the people of america have a concern with donald Trump 😂
Did she answer a single question?
25 min of questions, not a single answer
Who's trying to lock up who again, Kamala?
Does she ever actually answer a question?
Is she wearing the same Bluetooth earrings again ?
Why are illegal aliens getting lavish benefits while many of our vets are vegetating in the streets..? You should see some of the rent free homes  the regime is putting  them up in in Maine !
This is not a Rally Kamala, it’s an interview! You are not free to take 5 minutes to regurgitate your talking points! Brett Baier can interrupt and ask questions!
So can we move on from “TRUMP STOP THE BORDER BILL” hoax? Since Brett fact checked KH and informed me as well that Sander(I-VT), Booker(D-NJ), Markey(D-MA), Butler(D-CA), Padilla(D-CA) and Sinema(I-AZ) also voted AGAINST the bill?? So it was a bipartisan “NO THANK YOU” for the bill. Fact checked, now stop with lies…
Brett, tell her there is a time limit to answer one question, any question.
Another politican dodging questions
'can i finish?' proceeds to take 6 hours to finish answering one question.... yeah putin, kim and others are gonna enjoy talking to this lady...
Her tone and intonation paired with her inability to answer questions directly is indicative of someone who is unsure of themselves and their own beliefs.
Turning the page from the last decade?
The question was… how many? The wanker skamalame was agreeing to what?!?!😂😂😂it was a question😂😂😂
Politicians are so good at Dodge the question and answering a question without to answer the point. I mean if something they common good at its that.   For lazy people or people who do not understand english it will sound for them that she is responding well and answer the question.   Either way some people will vote for people like her anyways because other people around have said so.
I wonder if the Democrats have given up and thrown her under the bus? It would be poetic.
You can see the pauses while she waits for an earpiece answer
When is someone going to ask her about Willy?😮
how much plastic surgery this dude has
she literally didn't answer a single question.
WHY WHY DIDN'T Brett ask her you taking place of biden without actually running for president, no primary's is actually democracy ? Can you clue us in on anything LOL
Finally someone who is asking ALL the right questions . Making her accountable and explain
Strategy: draw out answers with word salad. Deflect to Trump. Don’t answer a question. Deflect to Trump. Get saved by handlers.
I like how she answered questions instead of standing and swaying for 40 minutes listening to random music.
She should get the question "How about the freedom of democracy if the mother aborts a growing fetus which has a firmly developed body and its own DNA and why should the mother be allowed to cat in half and suck it out?"
Can you imagine being so braindead that you’d vote for this simpleton?
Wonder how one would sound absent of bluetooth earrings
This idiot cant answer one question...
Kamala, are you on the Diddy tapes?
Why this dude look like a plastic figure of a young version of that old guy from up tho?
Wait what? What did she even say? There isn't a single answer here.
Look at her expression when listening to tje questions. I would bet money those earrings are earpieces. She's terrible even though being fed answers.
Is this a Greg gutfeld sketch
Does she ever answer a direct question with a direct answer? Instead she just waffles on and on and around any question.
She cannot answer a simple question and frankly she's rude and just terrible why are we even here? Not a single American voted for her
She’s made a fool of herself. How can she run a country if she can’t handle some simple questions.
She is full time liar. How is she fitted to even be VP??
Let me just finish!!  She drags every question out and never answers anything!!!
Her policy's don't actually say anything it's all a run around just like her
Why can't she answer one damned question? What a stupid woman to think we can't see right through her hopscotching blabber. So incompetent and unfit for any political position.
What change do you offer? I’m not Joe Biden, that would be a change.  What a joke
This woman speaks "evasive" fluently. She just refuses to answer direct questions specifically. Everything is a deflecting sidebar word salad. Bad temperment too.
Can she give an answer without the word trump in it haha😂
How many questions did she answer?
HEY, HOW COME THE BORDER WAS STILL BROKEN AFTER TRUMP LEFT?  WASN'T HIS WALL SUPPOSED TO STOP ALL IMMIGRATION?
She can’t even answer a question and everything is about Donald trump. Take some accountability you stupid vice president. You act like you haven’t been 2nd in command for the last 4 years… can’t wait to watch you lose
I get it you'll follow the law but when you make the laws you can do what you want..so answer the question do you support those topics.
Well done Bret Baier.  Most ask Kamala Harris "softball" questions.  Bret asked her the HARDBALL questions.  She still didn't answer them, but I am proud of Bret for asking and following-up where he could.
I thought you guys cover news. Why are you guys posting a comedy skit?
Can we invite her back for another interview? Someone please convince her that this went well
Then why isn't she trying to implement these changes now??  Better to be a successful incumbent than a completely stunned c.......  She reminds me of Justin Trudeau.... she talks incessantly yet says nothing.  Her voice does nothing but cause rage....
Who exactly is she “lifting up”?
How can she be about family? Trump, Vance, Elon, they all have many children. She has no children
Great interview. Professional , polite and excellent questions
Does anyone remember especially the Harris Team, that Trump went to  Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics. I am pretty sure the planet trusts him considering the ability of understanding economics!!!!
Donald trump was the answer for every question....this is dodging science class
He really does have a bad habit of cutting her off when she's responding. I understand it's a bunch of blah blah blah from her but still.... don't be like the others. Let her speak and follow up with how she dodged the question.
What color do you need to be to get that $25K first time home buyer gift?  That's what I wanna know!
Rumor has it, she's still answering the question
What? What? What do you represent Kamala? Say ONE thing.  You are a bunch of NOTHING
Nice interview, keeps pushing for answers, not long talks around the Bush
Wow how did they actually manage to find someone worse than Biden?!!!??????????
Please explain what f#$*ing power any vice president has? Civics 101 people. You all seem to forget that part. I blame your education system and your arrogance,
Deflection is not transparency.
What are you going to do?  Follow the law. Okay, anything else?
How tf can you be vice president and not know that this isn't a Democracy? It's a constitutional republic.
How did SHE sleep her way to the top ????
first question and she´s already frustrated, defensive and not answering it. probably doesn´t even know the numbers or doesn´t understand them. unbelievable. how could anyone vote for her?
Can't stand this woman. He can't answer any question
80 pages, yet you didn’t talk about anything but a first homebuyer loan? Smh
Can ANYONE see this woman negotiating with Putin, or another adversary ?However with the cackling, if long enough,the adversary may CAPITULATE.
Letting a guest answer a question without interruption and then asking a followup  after a person answers is the correct way to conduct an interview.    Fox is just really bad at news f’d and is more of an arm of an subversive group that hates democracy.
Remember when potential candidates would actually answer a question instead of trying to use Jedi mind tricks
Am I the only one that wanted to put my masculine fist through my TV?  I cant take anymore of this gaslighting insanity. THIS IS OUR COUNTRY PEOPLE!!!
And she used to be a lawyer???? Help me ...if she represented me for a parking ticket i would probably get 10 years
She will not answer a question
Why is this interviewer interrupting every time, it's so annoying to watch an interview like this . Did fox have no one better or that's the idea for them, to not let the other person speak
Didnt her staff quit on her
She dodged giving real answers.
why then are the immigrants monetarily rewarded and given housing adding to the problem by this administration??????
Hello! Ask her what she should have done when she was VP - which doesn't have the power of POTUS. Big difference.
Harris can't answer a simple yes or no question because she knows the truth doesn't look good.   No straight answers.  Zero honesty or accountability.
Wait?  This was scheduled for an hour long interview????
Is this the person that’s bringing JOY back to our country? 🤔 seems pretty angry to me.
Wait, I thought all I had to do as President was talk bad about my opponent… I have to get stuff done?
Everything trump's fault so my question how many more years in office do they need tonget it right..im mean 4yrs isnt enough so now they need 8yrs to get it right smh
I loved the way he asked “ how many”  immigrants and she used every evasion tactic possible
Do Democrats have someone better to run for office?????????
Maybe they should have writers a boarder bill instead of a bill that would have given billions to Ukraine. It was a Ukraine bill not a boarder bill.
Can she really stick to the point at all? To the questions being asked? And not beat around the bush.
I just want a real election and a peaceful transfer of power. Is that too much to ask?
Good job for Bret Baier for not giving her softballs questions
This woman is a clear example of a sociopath! Literally every question in any interview anywhere is immediately interpreted by her as a question of guilt and the response is to answer it immediately outside of herself and thus not taking responsibility for her own actions.
Turns out puppets don’t interview well (when real questions are asked)
Ok, start of the video, he asks one question, he doesn't even let her respond and cut her with another question... Good start with the honesty of this interview, at 2min30~ he tries to cut her again lol 😅
She wasn`prepared for REAL QUESTIONS.Never had real questions like these on THE FRIENDLY NETWORKS.Never had to answer them before.
Kamala dodged a few questions like a classic politician. Why didn't she just straight up lie like Trump does? That seems to work for him.
She can't answer a question at all
15 minutes in she can't answer a question ever
Some really solid questions from Brett.
21:24 what? 😭🤣🤣🤣
So she wont say anything, no policy, just every question is "but Trump" all she has
no offense but, why does every fox journalists looks like a washed up actress who couldnt handle aging
For the love of god answer a question directly 😅
i raised a middle class family whilst waiting for her to answer a question.
Why can't KAMALA answer the question???
Now Thats a Real Reporter and Questions! Well done Fox NewS and Bret Baier👏 Shame on MSNBC  ABC CBS CNN THE VIEW and the Rest of the Liberal Medias for Covering and Protecting Kamala! Now Shes Exposed Big Time……..DJT ❤️👍🫡🇺🇸🙏
So with a mentally incompetent president, the blame for what happened goes to the opponent, not the VP?
Is her campaign about discrediting Trump or is it about helping America?
Same as always, they don’t know how to answer a question so they just throw Trump out there
What are her plans?
When questioned about her own policies VP Harris looked like a rabbit in the headlights and tried to blame a person (aka former Pres. Trump) who was not in control of any Federal action and continued to lie about the facts. At last she was asked relevant questions and follow up questions and failed miserably.
I lasted 46 seconds. You?
Didn't DEMOcRATS _KNOW_ this is what they were putting UP ?
Why didn't they EXPECT this from THEIR "Candidate"  ??
What has happened to Gox News? Questions asked went unanswered followed by a feeble attempt to repose the question. Kamala managed the interview.
No matter how you feel about Gaza, does anyone else notice how unfeeling her eyes are when it comes to addressing the deaths of minors? Just something I caught
Did anybody count how many times she said Donald Trump?
Who was the moderator .. Kammy or Bret?
You're not answering the question, and unlike the other interviewers you've been with, he's not letting you get away with that, so either give a straight answer or shut up
He should have asked her about her husbands violence agianst women.
tell me what you would do lol
I’m all the way in Australia so I don’t have a horse in the race so this is a purely unbiased and genuine question… does she just parrot whatever she’s told through an ear piece? Just wondering because she takes pauses at the start of her sentences like she’s getting told what to say 🧐
😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫 answer the QUESTIONS!!
How can one still vote for her after this?
I want to hear more interviews from this guy, he asks tough questions but is calm and collected
Hostile interviewer but she held her ground well
If she thinks Iran is the biggest threat to the U.S  why did the Harris/Biden Administration just threaten/beg and do everything in their power to force Israel to back off on their retaliatory strike against Iran???
Has anyone noticed she's wearing those " wireless earings" very similar to those she wore on debate????
Bret Baier: "Madam Vice President, what is your favorite color?" Cackles McKneepads: "Donald Trump."
17:19 😂😂😂 what ?????
Um aren't you the one trying to eliminate free speech stop blaming Trump for your hangups Kamala
She’s wearing the same earrings that she was wearing at the debate. Coincidence?.
I don’t think she answered a single question
Brett should have followed up on the questions, she evaded For example when she did realise that joe biddn mental state became bad?
Your so-called plans are great, now where are you getting the money to pay for them? FEMA and Social Security are both under funded and don't have funds to bring your so-called plans to reality.
She avoided the question!!! She is horrable!!!
Does anybody know in what social class she grew up? She didn’t mention that, bummer!
“Why didn’t you teach these people well?” I’m the only candidate that has been a teacher, so I know best (a position you held doesn’t make up for incompetence)
Who had sent Jan 6 to jail?
Now imagine Kamala talking to Putin or Xi like that: can I finish my point? And she takes 10 mins to not answer a single question.
ChatGPT : Deciding who is the “lesser evil” between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, or whom to vote for, depends on your personal values, political priorities, and how you evaluate their policies, leadership styles, and track records. Here are some key factors to consider for each:  Kamala Harris  	•	Strengths: 	•	Progressive Policies: Harris supports expanding healthcare access, criminal justice reform, climate action, and protecting civil rights for minorities, women, and the LGBTQ+ community. 	•	Diplomatic Leadership: As Vice President, Harris focuses on diplomacy and alliances, working with global leaders on immigration, climate change, and human rights. 	•	Criticisms: 	•	Prosecutorial Record: Some argue that her time as California’s Attorney General was marked by decisions that led to the continued incarceration of non-violent offenders, which critics see as inconsistent with her progressive stance. 	•	Perceived Ineffectiveness: Some view her performance as vice president as lacking concrete achievements, especially in areas like border management.  Donald Trump  	•	Strengths: 	•	Economic Focus: Trump’s policies emphasized tax cuts, deregulation, and reducing foreign economic dependencies, which some argue boosted the economy pre-pandemic. 	•	Nationalism and Populism: His “America First” platform resonated with voters who felt left behind by globalization and elite politics, prioritizing national interests and stricter immigration controls. 	•	Criticisms: 	•	Divisiveness: Trump’s rhetoric is often cited as polarizing, contributing to heightened political tension and societal divides. 	•	Controversies: His involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot and refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election have drawn widespread criticism about his commitment to democratic norms.  Who to Vote For  To decide who to vote for, it helps to ask yourself a few key questions:  	1.	What policies matter most to you? – Do you prioritize social justice, healthcare, and climate action (Harris), or are you more focused on economic growth, nationalism, and immigration control (Trump)? 	2.	Leadership style – Do you prefer a more diplomatic and inclusive approach (Harris), or are you drawn to a bold, confrontational leadership style that challenges the status quo (Trump)? 	3.	Experience and integrity – How do you weigh their personal ethics, controversies, or their ability to lead the country in a direction that aligns with your values?  Ultimately, voting is a personal choice, and determining the “lesser evil” is subjective. Each candidate has strong supporters and detractors, so it’s important to vote for the person whose vision for the future aligns with your own.
How did Brett not burst out laughing when she started to get angry. I would not have that type of self control.
How many of you are watching this without bias or preconceptions already deciding how you're going to judge this?
Why was this interview given such little time. We could easily have used at least another half hour.
God help America if this woman is voted in. Seems as if she does not comprehend even the  most simple  question. .
Cut off junks of trans girls in girls prison? Hmm
80 pages of her policy on her website is crazy work...Really 80?
Did I hear a smoke alarm around 18:30 😂
Who's turning the military on the American people?   Revised 5240.01 Effective September 27, 2024 Page 13 Secretary of Defense Approval 2(C) authorizing troops to be used against civilians and to use lethal force on civilians where 'confrontation... is reasonably anticipated'
2:00 the democrats held a mojorty in the House and the Senate? She did nothing about it
Mr Brett did try his best to persist for  answers..but no one can talk ..because her agenda is to slander.  She can't  follow  through.
So can’t handle a reporter without losing her cool.. how will she handle our adversaries?
Why ask questions if you dont want the answers.
So is there anyone who worships maga capable of debating Harris without getting slayed?  Meanwhile trump the coward is phoning in his lying rants to his safe space from his golden bog….😂😂😂
SWAAALLLLOOWWW? We have done nothing whatsoever Bahasa
Holy sheet 6 minutes after the question and she has yet to answer
Deflection and convoluted
He wouldn’t be interviewing her like this if it was Trump he was interviewing. Trump would getting softball after softball question.
After 10 min listening to this women?🤯🤯🤯She is sooooooo incompetent
If you know what to do, why the hell you didn’t do it???
Is she gonna list of 75 bills without answering the question
She is so frustrating to listen to 😫 EVERY QUESTION GOES UNANSWERED.
What's the point of asking questions if you are not going to let her say a word!??
27 minutes without a single question answered
If Americans choose this girl i ll questioned their knowledge about politics and their intelligence
At last. Someone is actually asking her questions.
Answer the questions!!!!!
Someone is feeding her the words on the Israel question. Listen to the way she's talking. No one talks that way. The flow is all wrong. "I am offering, long pause,..." She's so fake and this is all rigged.
Why did he start out interrupting her right off the top? How rude!
We, the American people, DESERVE an answer, when did you first notice that President Biden's mental faculties appeared diminished?
Tried 2 pull a JD on biden question  She failed she failed she failed she failed........lmao
Did trump's campaign run out of money or is Fox afraid he'll shaft them on the bill (like he does the cities he holds rallies in) that they have to run his ads for free in an interview?! Unprofessional, unethical...typical Fox.
I’m confused why the “educated” populace votes for her. They’re so convinced they’re right that somehow they don’t realize they’re getting played
Does anyone else have a hunch that, after this interview, the polls will start to show substantial differences?
Stumpy never answers questions he just goes off into ring around the rosy lies until he forgets what the question was. 🤣  sundowners big time.
Wow, how to NOT interview - speak over the person you ask a question to whilst they try to answer you!!!!  Excellent work continuing misleading your moronic viewers! 👏
What are you going to to do no lets hear it
Not a single question answered!!!
Look how angry she gets when she is questioned.
She is in flight or fight
How does the v.p. pretend to answer questions with a straight face?  Who bought her soul?
Immediately deflects on the very first question.
Can no one see the smurk when she lies????????????????????????
He should have asked her why she isn't helping hurricane victims
My god! She is behaving like a 12th grade answering questions flip flopping the question itself or that “One Answer” for all questions
Great questioning and I think she performed well given the current temperature.
He killed the border bill? Ok why wait till the 11th hour to propose one?
When she can’t answer a question she likes to play the blame game instead of answering the question
I wonder how people would respond if she was a white man and had just performed like that
This b**** just says a bunch of nothing over & over & she wonders why he keeps cutting her off your not saying anything just yapping
WHY DOES PENCE NOT SUPPORT TRUMP ANYMORE??
Notice the same earrings ??! Has she ever raised the rumor that it’s an earpiece ????
This is like a beauty pageant winner responding to “how would you make the world a better place”
If DJT was questioned like that, being interrupted over and over right out of the gate he would have left the interview in a huff like he has so many others! 🤡
They’ve both been in office. Who was better?
lol finally someone asks her some real questions and pushes them. SHE LOOKS UNSTABLE
Can't answer a question.. pathetic
is there a word for what starts happening at 24:00 lol
And still no questions were answered
Joy versus Drill, Really USA ?
She is such a narcissist it boils my blood how she evades each question and lies!!!
What kind of dressing do you want with that salad ma'am ?
What the hell happen to trump face .he turn black.
what part of dumfuk is hard for u to understand?
Why did Bret feel compelled to interrupt an intelligent woman?   Why couldn't he let her finish her sentences?  Harris was a hell of a lot more cogent than he was.
What she's going to do is a secret... that she doesn't even know
She is hating this question.!
She can’t answer a single question
Its horrifyingly frustrating, listening to her every answer almost every question with, "Trump did this or said that". "What color is the sky?"   "Well Trump is dividing the people"...... NOOOOO ANSWER THE QUESTION PLEASE JUST SAY SOMETHING THAT ISN'T TERMINAL TDS PLEASE !
Did anyone understand anything she said?
Hey @YT, why can't I respond to Leftist comments? My comment posted. But, when I click on others to respond, nothing happens.
Always dodging the question
Is this the real life.....or is this just fantasy... caught in the lime light.... 😅😅😅
This is a typically a bias journalist.When you ask question, you expect an answer. But when the person tries to answer, this moderator wouldn't allow it.
Camel Harris is such a loser. She cannot even answer a direct and easy question. Always deflects as she continues to hide her beliefs. God help us as we do need President Trump back in the office.
How low IQ must you be so that you actually want to vote for her?
what was the question /?
Kamala didn't answer one question. I guess she has no answers.
He stood firm on questions and did not allow her to over power him...she was shaken and not stirred.
I’m a watch this back and try and count how many questions she actually answered.
Bout time she gets asked some real questions
Kamala stuttered real bad on that last question and got so defensive 😂🤣 thank you fox news for your videos keep them coming 👍
Is that the full interview?
she smoking crack?
Every question answer is “TRUMP”.  Meanwhile the silence in between her words signalling that her earpiece is working.  😅
Talking over her the entire interview and at the end asks if she got to say what she wanted LMAO what an idiot unreal😂😂😂
spin spin spin, does this disaster ever tell the truth, her and joe have so much blood on there hands
I see a lot of videos of people asking "Why vote for Kamala? What is she going to bring to the table?" And they usually cant answer... well now i know why... she cant even answer that question herself
She went around every question that’s crazy
She was finally confronted with real hard question, this ain’t ABC or CBS !!!! If this doesn’t convince people , specially Democrats, then we are DOOMED !!!!!!
does not look like the dems want to win this election, maybe they know something we don't?
Why do these lying commie wanna be’s NEVER get fact checked?! Vote Trump! It’s the obvious choice between the 2!
Somebody  please go back and tell us how many questions she never answered. So rarely does anyone get to press the left this way!😊
Guadalajara cartel? Which one is that?? 😮😮😮
What about all the women who lost their lives due to Donald Trump's abortion bans?
How can people vote for her?!
She is such a narcissist it boils my blood how she evades each question and lies!!!
How many lies can she pack into one short interview?
Is she serious?
Can she do anything other than deflecting to trump?
She can’t give a number hmmmm
Where was the joy? 🤡
Wow, I'm 10 seconds in.  Brett asks her a question.  She begins to answer.  He stops her after 2 seconds (disrespectfully) and pivots.  Already lame.  I will continue and see what else happens.  2nd question, won't let her talk.  So far, he looks dumb af.
Does she bring up “I was raised in a middle class family”? If she did I’m not watching..
Why did they undo TRUMPs executive orders were in place why did they undo them, the first day.
She talks too much but never answer the question.
Fox should actually ask trump hard questions like this
Question on Joe Biden's mental stability had her "open-mouthed" för 5 seconds!
The questions were dumb to be honest lol
13:56 Is this a Trump interview or is it about Kamala?   She blames Trump for her administration?   Pathetic children.
She fumbled the kickoff.... terrible, she is confused..  he is asking about 2021 2022 2023..... not "9 months ago" Dems had full control for 2 yesrs...... fail
They did tell her that Trump isn’t president currently correct? I’m just curious cause she’s acting like he’s the current president. That’s what’s confusing.
Can't answer a question directly
This woman is an absolute idiot. Never answers the question and says the same BS over and over again. What a freaking joke.
She love to backpedal on the questions he is asking her. Now she thinks has a plan to fix a problem that current administration, which she is part of. And trying to blame others for the problem at southern border. She has no plans and never mentioned how she will initiate these plans. Backpedaling again on her answers.
why is she talking that way?
She's avoiding the questions. Who are the bigger idiots supporting this idiot?  Really good interview. Asking all the right questions and exposing her idiocy.
I could of sworn that's Maya Rudolph...is this SNL?!?!
I know fox is trying to put a hard interview on kamala to show her weakness but the way the interviewer is acting is really bad, its fine to ak tough question but you have to let the person answer, i mean he is acting more as if he was debating her
Hard question 😳😬🤥  “Well Donald Trump…” This is like what a young child does (pointing fingers instead of taking responsibility)
8:48 does anyone believe that she gets it?   She doesnt get anything that wasnt given to her from her masters.
Her hand gestures and long winded answers that dont even answer the question shows shes just in her fake politician mode. She is one of the fakest people, will lie and sidestep to get in office.
Why can’t Kamala just answer a question ?
I’d like to hear why she censored a true story by pressuring Facebook before last election
Why does this woman still have any realistic chance of becoming president?
For those saying, “Let her talk!” No, I disagree. He spared us the cookie cutter, rehearsed responses she was attempting to give to deflect and not answer the question. All the intelligent folks noticed what he was doing and we LOVED it. We don’t need those non answering cookie cutter word salad that we’ve been getting for 4yrs…nip that shhh!t in the bud.
This has to be the most pretentious woman to ever dodge a question in the history of politicians dodging questions.
The Iran question at the end when she starts talking slowly is when we know she's relaying messages from her magic earrings.
What infrastructure?
How dare you ask me questions I don't want to answer.
Why they are Supporting Donald Trump then?
Those must be her lucky earrings? Shes also wearing them?
I can imagine the folks at the trump campaign and fox got together to draw up the questions for this is interview to create little soundbites for their campaign. I would like them to ask trump the same type of questions and see what happens to them. She stood her ground well. If you're going to comment negative about her, perhaps you needs to ask yourself where it's comming from.
So this is the first time she’s actually been asked a serious question by the media.
quoting mark milley? really?
When will Trump go on MSNBC?
Why does she keep referring to herself as we if she were to become president
Has ANYONE noticed that Kamala with all her money wears those same earrings every time she’s in the public, making a speech or on any talk show? Keep your eyes on her earrings every time you see her. Gods Blessings.
1,500 more BP agents won't mean anything if the policy is releasing them in America with a court date after they've been detained.
I have never seen someone say so much and yet say nothing at the same time. It should be a riddle.
The interviewer asking really dumb questions
She completely dodged Biden health question
Yet millions have come in with are you saying Kamala...total bs
What jacked up timeline am I in now?
She litteraly cant handle an interview where they dont hold her hand and let do 3 takes for every question
Does anyone actually believe in her? I’m confused how she has a singular vote coming her way.. 🙄
This woman is crawfishing  ever question. Blaming trump 😊
lol why is the media attacking kamala and defending trump? something wrong is not right
How can people vote for this woman
😂😂😂 she’s not answering the question!!!!
I didn't appreciate the bait and loaded question portion regarding the enemy within, and asking her if she thought the American people were stupid.  That's a partisan trap to end a candidate..
how can anyone with brain vote for this 304?
Just a humble question: Where is D. Trumps medical record, how come he said he wanted to be dictator for a day, change the constitution, what is his "concept of a plan", why does he refuse to take another debate as he was mocking Biden for, why does he oppose IVF and abortion... and have people complaining about inflation noticed that it's not a - certainly very annoying - fact in the US, but A GLOBAL POST-COVID PANDEMIC GLOBAL PROBLEM?
Wondering,, can we get a number on how many times she said "Donald Trump" in this interview 🤔 I started getting dizzy 😵‍💫
she will NOT answer the question about Joe Biden she spent 5 minutes trying to avoid it HAHAHAHA
Why did they play the wrong clip about the “Enemy from within?” 🤔
Question? Kamala answers Donald Trump. Please no further ,she cannot become president.
1st question out of the gate about illegal immigrants, and she never once went to the border. She'll never be able to duck that issue.
How can he ignore that those young women would be possibly still alive if trump hadn’t given the order to deliberately vote against a bill that would have brought massive change to border control because he wanted to keep it a problem so he could use it as an issue for his electoral campaign.
Will she ever answer a question? She was asked “will you support gender affirming surgery for inmates??” Her answer: “I will follow the law…” shm!! Unbelievable how noone can get her to answer anything on point🤦🏻‍♀️
Oh weird… 🤔 she is wearing the same earrings??? 🧐 I wonder why.
this woman is good at avoiding questions hahahha
The last 3 1/2 years are like the season of Dallas that was a dream…except the last 3 1/2 years have been a nightmare. 80 pages of policy’s the question is who wrote the 80 pages
it's absolutely about time someone interviews a Democrat with real questions and doesn't accept their rambling nonsense as actual fact, truth or even an answer to the actual question
21:51 - 22:02   Oh BROTHER, just answer the question!
Is she still wearing those ear rings 😂
The only masterclass here is the guy asking the questions. Listening to her is an insult to anyone's intelligence.
Yes, he "grilled" her because he asked a question and gave his answer.  At 0:046 I am done with this "Interview". DONE.
Does she know how to answer questions? This is so painful, watching every answer just reflecting to trump, they’ve been running it to the ground for years and she forgets this?? She hasn’t done no good so far … why would it change now?????
Youtube is already threating me with CENSORSHIP.....Who's the fascists YouTube  ?......Maybe be on the side of AMERICA for once !
She still has the earpiece that looks like an earring eh?
She could not directly answer any question
She simply can't answer a question😂
She never answered a single question! Disgusting!! What a washout!
Does she ever answer questions or does she just talk in circles?
Finally someone forcing her to answer a question with facts not word salad ❤
Why did she even do this interview?
He's in her dreams too......isn't he 😅
@18:23 Did I really hear a fire alarm beep?! lol
Brett, why didn't you hit Kamala on why the Border bill was not passed IE the foreign aid that what is hidden in the bill that would have sent way more money overseas than money to help the Border?
finally, an interviewer that asks follow ups
I have a question for both of you, Harris and Trump, I been ran paperwork to bring my fiancé from Laos to U.S for almost 8 years now, but still can’t get approve it, for just one person only, but Biden allow Illegal immigrant Million and Million cross border, I am a Christian I had nothing to hind, nothing fake, nothing to lied, everything tell the trusted, in this case I don't know how's Harris and Trump explain about that
Does she know this interview is about her not trump???
Why has Fox flipped? Change of batter coming
The 1st real interview harris has done ..well done Bret on not letting her tiptoe around the question and bringing it back in line 👍
Nothing worse than someone who can't directly answer one single question.
This guy is a terrible interviewer.
Ffs,can she answer one question without mentioning Trump.
You will follow the law?! Yet, you’re lawless & also trying to rig our Constitutional Rights…hmmmm 🤔🧐🤨
Is it just me, or did anyone else keep yelling at the TV "SHUT HER UP!"? Do I have to watch it twice to hear if she spoke of anything else but "Donald Trump". He is PRESIDENT TRUMP. Put a sock on her, please🤷🏻‍♀️
She immediately got very offensive when asked a simple question. What a piece of work
Obviously all the questions are to push a narrative. She couldn't finish a single answer.
SHE CAN'T EVEN ANSWER A QUESTION
Huh, you recognize the problem  since day one in the office and what did you fixed? 🤬🤬🤬 you made everything worse !MTF !
I think she would have taken the whole 25 minutes to answer the first question if he had let her
Same earrings hmmm....
Does she ever get to the point? Pure madness how much she can talk and say nothing.
This was very brutal to watch. She has no answers.
Anything she can't answer she turns to the law and Trump.
Does she only own one pair of earrings?
She still won’t answer the question.  What a freaking FAKE!!!  A LOSER!
Thank you Brett for actually asking her real questions and holding her accountable. 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Every question  she is blamed, Trump  😂😂😂😂😢😢
Try answering the questions rather blaming Trump, smh
But Kamala, how did the job get open for you?? Nobody elected you in the primary. Be so for real
Look she talked in circles never answer a question.  She had 4yrs she has done nothing .
Lets have an interview.  I will ask you a question,  then I will interrupt you several times while you are answering.  That guy is a joke.
You and i both know what I am talking about? Lol I actually don't know what you are talking about. 😂😂😂😂😂😂.
literally not a single question answered
i NOTICED HE ASKED A QUESTION,  THEN TALKED OVER HER WHILE SHE TRIED TO TALK.  THIS ELECTION, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,  I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO VOTE DEMOCRAT.
1. Question 2. No answer, talks about Trump to deflect  3. Interviewer starts to clarify or ask a follow-up 4. Harris proceeds to talk louder and interrupt, “I’m not done yet!”   Well then get to the point! I think her advisors must have said, “Just talk about Trump the whole time, since we really don’t have any good answers for these questions.”
I'm still waiting for the answer to the questions.
It’s good to know she wants open borders cause there’s not even a single statement on her website……
She clearly didn’t want to answer a single question.
👏🏻 👏🏻 FINALLY A REAL INTERVIEW, WITH REAL QUESTIONS!!! SHE IMPLODES WHEN THAT HAPPENS.👏🏻👏🏻
Did she Freudian slip that Biden is the experiment?
Did she cut and paste her 80 pages of policy from Wikipedia?
How do you chart a new way forward when you been in office 3.5 years
Is she talking in slow motion?
Finally an interview that asks about the real issues! 90 percent of her answers is blaming Trump when she has been in office for the past 3.5 years. This interview was her chance to show what her plan is if she is elected to fix America. No accountability, and no solutions. Just a bunch of word salad.
Finally hard core questions accountability
Why not answer one fkin question without referencing your opponent. So annoying
Brett, why did you let her continue to go on and on about Trump?
Thank you Brett for actually asking her real questions and holding her accountable. 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Blow up our deficit? Hasn't her asministration done this
Are you going to share your experiences with judge Brown? That would be interesting
Where is accountability in here?
No real answers…
She still does not answer the question she's is full of dog you poop💩💩💩💩 TRUMP ALL THE WAY 1000%🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
What does "following the law" mean on prisoner gender change ?
Is this how she will talk with world leaders?
She does not answer the question 😊
She’s a horrible liar, it’s simple  just answer the question. Why did your administration change most if not all of the already proven and working  well policies of Trump? Word salad yup that’s what we a new was going to happen.
If she (and the “experts”) lied about Biden’s mental competence… why should we trust her (and them) now?
Why the hell is our tax dollars paying for transgender surgeries for prisoners…. WHAT???? when there are children in this country that are not get the health care that they need???? WTH is going on?
Liberals never answer the question, emotion based deflection every time
Why did she change a lot of her positions ?? and why is no answer relevant while claiming it to be true when everybody can see the lies spoken 😮😮😮😮😮 LORD please help us, save us from this evil
Bret Baier let the woman speak!! You ask a question just to speak over her!!
If ppl are tired of trump then why does she keep talking about him?
Oh my God, this woman is a sad human being! America has fallen so low? Are you going to let this woman lead the USA?
Bad interviewer. Stop asking questions and then over talking her. Let her talk, stop arguing. Idiot.
Why is Brett not fact checking this person?
Wonder if the same people who complained that Martha Raddatz interrupted JD Vance many times in the ABC interview come back here and complain about Bret Baier interrupting Harris all the time?
Wasn't she just dancing and chanting with a group of people screaming absolutely no deportations? The deportation bill she keeps refferingbto was a rubber stamp to give MILLIONS automatic citizenship. Those democrats and republicans that voted it down are the ones that should be applauded.
If, according to her Biden is fine and fully functional Why is he not on the Ballot?!?
Is it r3tarded?
Why a person/ party  party before a country???? I didn't get it.
Are we watching Elaine from Seinfeld in real time. A show she is putting on about nothing
How is she this bad??? 😂😅😂
What ear rings does she have on
20:50 best question of the whole interview
If she yells, does that make it true?
That Biden question ate her up inside lmfaooo 😂 she couldn’t believe he asked her about joes mental health 😅
she could'nt answer the questions
Can she take any responsibility for her actions over the last 4 years?
I hate how she dodges every single question and her hypocrisy.
Anybody in the comments wanting policy answers from kamala is missing the plot. We have her policy. Its on her website and there are MANY interviews detailing her plans. The reason it seems like a word salad when she answers these questions is because they are loaded. Much like a loaded question when Vance can't answer whether or not he accepts the results of the 2020 election.
Don't get why they allow trump ramble of topic to the point the original question is forgotten, and Kamala not allowed to finish answering a question.
is she the first vice president we ever expected to be in control of anything?
still not able to answer...goes around and around.... TRUMP 24  🇺🇸
So why you did not fix the broken immigration system?
Can she answer a simple question instead of deflecting to Trump everytime.
She can’t answer a single question
Please CAN SHE STOP LYING GET HER OUT
She sounds like someone who didn't graduate from high school - too many drugs?
Good heavens she is the absolute idiot. Her administration has been the worst ever. She has not answered one question.
The question is indeed, why is half the country supporting Donny?
You don’t know the question how can you answer
How is it even possible that she is running for PRESIDENT? 😅
What has she done is she crazy
More judges to do what expedite citizenship? In exchange for socialist programs ?
If we circle back in 4 years, she still hasn't answered the first question...😅
Kamala Harris can't even answer a simple yes or no question she has no answer because she has no plan
She was getting way too heated over calmly asked serious questions, she kept going off ranting about Trump. Totally Trump derangement syndrome. Kamala Harris is emotionally unstable. Ask her anything and she starts ranting about Donald Trump.
She answer nothing! 😂
The enemy within? He has been shoot at twice by Americas in America. How much more of an enemy within can you get?
So she can tell when Trump is unstable and not well but she couldn’t tell that Biden was unstable and not well?
How can she blame Trump for the last 3.5 years .She was in office not him. All she wants to do is blame Trump for everthing.
What is she talking about she’s saying nothing.
I wonder why she's always talking in third person
If Trump is responsible for everything while she holds the power of office.. what do we need her for..?
She can't definitively answer a question without going into a rambling mess.
Did you noticed that she has not mentioned Project 2025 once💁🏻‍♂️
She can't answer a simple question
Typical fox. Asks a question not for a answer, but for prepared additional remarks that push the loaded questions' point. That's why people watch comedic shows for journalism.
Cackles McKneepads unburdened every question with another lie with plenty of word salad.
Avoiding the questions and blame blame. Pathetic
This person will not answer a question....
He proceeds to ask her questions but doesn't let her talk, one hell of an interview. Not to mention cut her off right at the end with a wrap before she gets a full sentence out lmao.
Strengthening small business? By adding all these new bureaucratic items inundated to go against the success of a small business which only big business can afford to hirer those people needed to do those items to be in compliance to these new laws?
She’s going to give $25,000 for housing where will she get this money?
Anyone notice she is still wearing the same earrings in every interview that she wore in the debate? Still getting controlled from behind the curtains.
Vice President Kamala Harris always run away from the questions  She always do not answer the questions clearly
Am i the only one screaming at the tv
Well that wasn't an interview. Was it. Was it?
Why are they talking over each other?
The question was about America, not Israel. We are definitely bought and paid for.
She's not answering the question.your blood pressure will get high talking that dumb vice president of the USA.
it is like she can't hear the questions.
What kind of dressing is going on that word salad?
JESUS CHRIST!  She is just running the clock… She refuse to answer the questions and begin to vomit out her usual word salad… I made it 3 mins in and I am about to hurl
Repeating the question is just a sign of guilt just to let you know sorry
Leave it to Kamala to never answer the question being asked 😂😂
Fox has been grilled, not her. Be honest!
Finally some hard questions.
She doesn't say she regrets the open borders and if it's a priority since day 1 then why has it been 4y?
Have they produced any evidence proving Trump killed the immigration bill?
How is it possible that 50% of the population still supports this cringe woman?
the only questions he asked started with your critics say...  Biden this Biden that.
I would like to know where has she been for the last 3 1/2 years
Why anyone give this lady air time?
If those are Tiffany pearl earrings and not Bluetooth - WHY???? CONTINUE WEARING AND CONTINUE THE CONTROVERSY
Same earrings as the debate that seem suspiciously similar to the Bluetooth ones for someone worth over 7 million according to google you don't change your earrings?
She said lets no point fingers but keeps going back to trump and pointing fingers at him when a tough question comes her way and rather not answer it...She can't give a straight answer this is suppost to be first grade stuff, someone gives a question and you answer it directly not indirectly..
Answering a direct question without mentioning Donald Trump challenge. Impossible for an imbecile. If nails on a chalkboard took human form, yuck
Anyone need to learn how to completely dodge questions with vague/evasive/nonsense responses?  Kamala Harris is the queen of dodging questions!
she answered nun of the questions asked… bunch of gibberish I really hope these democrats seen this….
Why are you giving those immigrants funding tho???
She just WILL NOT answer the question. Because she CAN'T answer it. Because it was wrong (to rescind Remain in Mexico). Period.
I hate politicians that can’t answer a direct question
Funny how she felt for the first time what crooked Media does to trump with questions. The only difference is that Fox questions are actually FACTS
Word salad, word salad, word salad, Trump blah blah blah, word salad, word salad, Trump, blah blah blah, on and on and on. Never did give an answer to a question, just ate up the clock....what a waste of space she is.
I don't understand how people can watch this and not realize these are cheap attempts at "gotcha" questions.
How do the viewers of Fox not see through their bs?
Waiter: "What would you like to have for drinks?" Me: I was raised by a middle class family.
Did he even offer to drink a beer with her?  Pretty unprofessional.
Is she stupid? What’s these answers have to do with the question! She is a tragic, this is why she’ll never become a president! She belongs at McDonalds, where she said she worked. She’s a train wreck! 😊
Just answer the question lady 🤦
Jesus Christ, can she not answer a single fcking question?
Thank you,Bret, for holding this person accountable and not letting up on the hard questions! You stayed firm and allowed to be introduced to the real Kamala  she keeps blaming  my president! Catching her in these lies. She squirms and slithers around questions 🤬
Saying you're sorry for her loss isn’t saying you're sorry for what u did. You have zero accountability Harris
What a moron. She hasn't the capability to answer a question. Saleperson/attorney type responses to all questions.And ALWAYS blaming the previous administration.
Jesus christ how is she running for president? Why vote her? She dodges every question.
Does she know she is crazy?
If this was the SATS, she would have left a lot of questions blank
Please just answer one question instead of going on a nonsense rant
4 minutes and 11 seconds in, and she still has not answered a question…..
First time I see her having a real interview and she couldn’t answer a single question.
Can she even go a sentence without mentioning Donald Trump and answer the question?
She does not have a solid or coherent answer for any questions he is asking.   Absolutely nothing!
Can Trump sit on NBC like this?
Finally an interview, with follow ups !  Great questions but zero answers :-)
Who TF is voting for that…
When will Trump be on MSNBC? 😂
How can we elect a person to be POTUS who keeps running away from answering straight questions???
Do democrats not hear what she is saying or frankly what she is not saying. The word salads are unbearable to listen to.
How can you trust a person that betrayed America
Who is ACTUALLY locking up people for actively disagreeing? Not Trump.
Why doesn’t he or anyone else ever bring up the fact that every effort Texas made to secure the border, the federal government countered their efforts to secure the border?
She's got those earrings on again!! Whose she listening to??? She talks in circles
STOP INTERRUPTING HER.  FFS. An interview is asking a question and allowing the person to respond.
Answer the question 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Omg!!!Kamala never answer simple questions. All her answers doesn’t make sense. She lies and lies 😳😳😳
Harris has accepted 17 million dollars from anti fracking groups. Why? If she isn't against fracking....now.
This country is nearly 250 years old and ain’t got its border laws / immigration laws figured out yet?
Why did the Biden-Harris administration issue Executive Order to stop wall building which quadrupled illegal immigrants, and blamed that they inherited the problem from the Trump administration??
What a joke, she cannot even answer a simple question about what she would do differently. Always goes back to Trump but he hasn’t been in office and she has!
Just answer one question, and you did call Americans stupid, liar
Still trumps fault? He hasn’t been president Igor last 4yrs! This country is in far worse shape since Trumps been out!
When he asks the first  question and interrupts her after 10 seconds  you know he was defeated.  After 20 seconds Baer did nothing but interrupt her, never defended Trump and got his azz handed to him, game, set, match, Harris.
Her face when he asked about transgender operations for prisoners using tax dollars lmao
Not one straight answer from her.
Kamala, what about the single black mother that you had arrested and put in jail because her daughter who has sickle cell anemia and had missed school? You can't answer that! You have American blood on your hands!
And what have most every person that worked for her had to say about her!!???
What kind of debate is this where he won't shut the hell up and let her talk? If Trump was sitting there he would not even open his mouth.... 🙄
ask a question, let the person you asked answer?  nope not on Fox News.  Unless you are called Trump, then you can ramble on and on and the interviewer does nothing.
Is this the whole interview?
He never let go from the start! Question after question, fact checking! No wonder she looked pissed immediately😅😅😅
Does mr Brett understand the role and power of vice presidency? He can look at mr mike pence 😂
I would follow the law is not an answer to the question. Can’t wait to TRUMP is back in office.
You are not stating facts
Will he allows Vice President Harris to answer his questions or continues to interrupt her?????
Why she act like a baby momma and ain't got no babies😂
If Springfield migrants are a threat, why would a candidate have to lie about it.
She can’t answer a single question
Do you owe those families an apology? *Shakes head no*
Locking people up because they disagree......hmmm isnt that what you are doing??  Your pathetic
13:23 - is this the Royal "We" or we as the "Cabal"?
A fish out of water! Thank you Bret for that hard-hitting questions.
Wonder if the same people who complained that Martha Raddatz interrupted JD Vance many times in the ABC interview come back here and complain about Bret Baier interrupting Harris all the time? 😆
Ask how many children she lost because of trafficking.
Million $ Question of the show!!! Brett: You have been VP for 3.5 years, so what are you turning the page from?
Why O Why can’t SCAMALA just answer a question without it taking 10 minutes?  WHY????
Jesus Christ finally some tough questions
It's nice to watch an interview that's not bias towards Harris, The View or MSNBC would never ask her tough questions like this.
The thing is, when you are in politics for so long, you become so good at dodging questions and dancing around the answer.  It is a super power.
Asking what your policies are not if you follow the law. Wow deflect much this woman has no policies, she will do what her bosses tell her.
How is she this bad in an interview?
Wow, her website went from displaying zero policies to suddenly displaying 80 pages of policies? They are getting desperate.
Who is being grilled ? Kamala ???
Grilled ? Oh please …. She grilled frumpy
She totally skipped answering the question about Biden and his mental state.... wow... 🧐🤔
A free masterclass in how to NOT answer questions and to persist in non-content speech.👍
who's biden?
Let’s be unclear.
Harris is vice president not president so ask Biden bout the border
She seems incapable of answering a question!😮
Not one question answered?
Kamala… did you have a brain fart during the entire 20 minutes of this interview? Oh wait… you have no brains!
Bret Baier - DA God  - did a good job  she taught she was going get easy air station talk show questions lol
She has not answered any very simple question throughout the interview. She beats around the bush and stays away from the main topic.
This women doesn’t answer the questions, Brett was too nice to her.  Please  be smart about who you vote for, if your considering her dj t go vote,  go do something fun
she cant even answer the question
"Uhhhh..... is this question a yes or no answer,  or is it an essay question?...."
How many times did she say Donald Trump??
We want to learn about you and your policies which is why we spent 20 minutes asking you questions about Joe Biden’s choices and speaking over your answers classic fox
how many died at the border when trump was president?
His interviewing skills are basically ask a question,let Harris start to answer ,then shout her down. No one gets indepth responses with that,but then thats probably the point. It shows weakness on his part, that he doesn't think he can counter whats said if he allowed a detailed response.  Ive notice alot of interviewers do this, shout down responses at the start of the interview, so the interviewees are knocked off their composure. Its a horrible style of interviewing, and does a disservice to the voters.
Higher taxes for the rich?  How does that help the middle class?  They dont get anything from that.
She’s so rude while at the same time not answering the question!  She has to repeat her rehearsed lines before she has forgotten them.
Answer question and leave Trump alone
Idiotic questions, excellent answers.  He would have been happy to just ask a question, let her get in two words, and move on to the next one. Ridiculous.
was this an interview or a debate? It seems like Brett has much more speaking time.
Can you go 30 seconds without mentioning Trump??
How many of you took A "SHOT" every time she said "TRUMP?
Question: Are you going to defend Taiwan if China CCP invade Taiwan?  A: Let me be clear. I grow up in a middle class family
She only talks in riddles.
She has not answered 1 question
Can we please get a body language expert to help explain her?
Brett let her talk way too long and get off of the topic of the question that she was asked
“Why does she keep talking about Trump the whole time? Can she talk about her own policies instead? We’re even more confused.
She is talking over him.  These are legitimate questions about her support of Biden's policies in strengthening Iran.
6 democrats voted against that bill out of how many?
How about giving the taxpayer a break  we are now paying for people who never paid a dime into our system
Does anyone know how many times she said Donald Trump’s name?
21:32 THAT WAS A VERY GOOD TRICKY QUESTION AND SHE ANSWERED IT WELL. AND AGAIN, SHE'S NOT ACTING LIKE A RED-FACED TODDLER WHENEVER SHE ENCOUNTERS TOUGH QUESTIONS LIKE TRUMP DOES.
still didnt answer anything
Honestly the way he asked the question and then just talked all over her wasn’t a good look.
I SEE A LOT OF COMMENTS SUPPORTING  TRUMP ON HERE, QUESTION WHAT HAS TRUMP DONE FOR YOU AS PRESIDENT❓❓❓
The man had to interrupt because you keep going on a tangent when asked a simple question. This is unbelievable. You have to be ashamed of yourself of you think this is the right person run this country
I wonder if Brett could smell the wine when she started yelling
No answer on her complicity about Joe Biden’s cognitive decline over the last 3+ years. This alone should disqualify her from office. She’s right… Joe Biden isn’t on the ballot… she is. And it’s an indictment of her judgment in allowing it to happen and her truthfulness and trustworthiness as a would-be world leader.
Why are all democrats so obsessed with Trump? This is insane.
Why did you and Joe Biden give billions to Iran while you left our homeless veterans lving in the streets
Good job Bret...she couldn't answer 1 question
How much of lies can have this demoncrat on her mouth? She never finish to spite lies
Any shame of yourself?
Is she even aware that giving tax cuts to the rich creates jobs? The reason billionaires are billionaires is cus they make money, and to do that they need to  create work. They can't create more jobs at the moment in the states because it's too expensive for them. Giving them tax cuts is a win win for everybody.
Does he ask her about her many voices
Does she talk about anything other than Trump?
Giving 25k to help with downpayments will only drive up  housing prices.   How about dropping mortgage rates?  At 7%  you are paying over $1000  more a month on a 300k house in interest alone vs a 3%  thats 12k a year, or $360,000 MORE over a 30yr mortgage.
Was trump grilled by fox news ever?
Why are Trump voters obsessed with people’s genitalia?
She can't even answer one question... She's a disgrace
She's the Mayweather of answering a question because she can duck and dodge them at an elite level
If trump is stopping your current administration for doing anything, are you going to get anything done in the next?
Why do so many people support wacky donnie?  It's not like Faux news has spent every hour of everyday lying to people and convincing them he's a god-like figure. What can it possibly be...
Why can’t she answer questions??!! Omg
Where's her accent? LOL
She can’t answer a question if her life depended on it! She is an absolute idiot!
Is keeping Trump out, the main reason we should vote for her?!? She represents nothing substantive it seems.
Have you noticed that Kamala wears the same earrings for every interview…mmm 👀
Did anyone count the number of times she mention Trump?
Dish she say "experiment" referring to biden ..then swayed to trump..how is she so confused?
boy she sure knows how to avoid a question
On Monday, there's a game between the Chiefs and the 49ers. Does anybody know what time it starts?
Just another amongst many politicians who never answer a question. It happens in England! America and the rest of western civilization
She avoids answering the questions and tries to act like she cares about the people while doing nothing.
I’d really like to know who came up with the idea of setting a time limit and cutting her off instead of letting her speak freely. Why hasn’t that person been fired yet?
Isn’t she the one who had people arrested for praying outside abortion clinics, arrested for attending the J6 event? Yet she says Trump will use the military against the people…okay
Wow! Who’s better at dodging questions than her!! Man!!! Dems couldn’t do better than this!!?
Painful non-answers I feel like a vegetarian with her word salads
You give Kamala a question she gives you a blank stare at first.  Trying to summon any knowledge in her head.
She is doing the same thing repeatedly, not answering the question and moving in the circle.
Nothing like a bunch of gotcha questions from faux and Kamala aced the responses. Kamala/Walz 2024! 🎉
Will Trump now agree to an interview by MSNBC?
FINALLY someone actually asked her real questions
She doesn’t answer the question because she’s responsible for the crime wave.
You can tell she tries to recall her scripted answers every time she’s asked a tough question… there’s literally nothing going on up there in that head of hers
everytime kamala finishes talking i forget what the question was.
How can there not be one single comment I can find that supports her, and apparently 47% of the country supports her?!?
What kind of professional journalist asks a question and then speak over the person so they can’t respond.
Wait, why was she in the situation room without Joe Biden? Was this a standing order from the president is unavailable to have the vice president step in? Why was Joe Biden unavailable?
Trump is dodging bullets. She's dodging questions
30 minutes of questions and not one direct answer, she is so far unqualified it’s unbelievable..
The dems have literally locked people up for freedom of speech. Does anyone remember Clinton locking that guy up for a meme? 😂🤡
Never answered first question
She can’t answer one question.  She is such a liar and was of skin!
Can anyone name one piece of legislation Trump passed? Even one?
How many illegal immigrants have you RELEASED into the country? What kind of question is that? Oh Bret… 😂
So sad that she can't answer the question but deflects the conversation Trump.  "Trump is unstable but Joe Biden is on his game"?
How....can someone vote....for her...?
17:57 you bandwagoned with all the people trump fired to bad mouth him instead of laying out policy?
Please God can someone Fact Check if Harris actually did prosecute drug runners? I heard that in 10 years she only had 1 case per year which is super non productive don't ya think?
Hmm those ear rings again?
Can this woman not answer a single question?  Shame on the USA who allows a shameful individual to be on the ballet
4 years and she couldn’t turn the page??? Are the papers stuck together with glue or you Kamala?
Lmao she literally didn't answer a single question
Unstable? Lady, look in the mirror.
Vice President Harris you are a disgrace and you act so smug calling Mr. Bier down. For once you are being asked real questions who's not taking your run around of nothing said!
Can she unburden us of herself already
How many times did he interrupt and talk over? Must have been 16 or 17 times.
Does she ever get tired of lying??
how about the one's silenced still under threat
Bret is staring at her the whole time , like what wrong with this person lmao
Answer the question. Why keep blaming Trump
Answer the G D questions!!!!!!
Always deflecting
She had a typical politician "word salad" response to a lot of these questions. Not as bad as Trump, of course, but still not very informative. Can we start demanding politicians answer questions to the same standard of like, a high schooler giving a class presentation at least? I don't think I've seen the candidates give more than five or six comprehensible answers about policy in the last few years.
He should have played her the clip with the full question.
Then why she green light emptying prisons and giving them the good life on us
I had a boss once ask me a question and before I could answer it he said...I want a dictionary answer, not an encyclopedia answer. It was appropriate then and it is appropriate now. I would settle for an answer that you could correlate with the question.
Can she answer the question for gods sake
Man, she is terrible. Won’t answer a question but then insists she be allowed to finish all her non answers when asked to answer the question.
She never answers a question directly
He asks a question, she begins talking and it's clear she's avoiding the actual question... so he answers it the best he can to provide the context for which he was looking for in order to ask the NEXT question..... And she's audacious enough to say "well I was beginning to answer it"....she is such a prototypical politician.
How many times did she say Donald Trump?
The lapel pin is so dumb. Can we give up this fashion disaster please
What's the point of having an interview that the interviewer doesn't even let the interviewee talk and keeps interrupting her?
Next person she interviews with should ask about the people she blocked from being freed when she knew they were innocent
She likes to dance around the questions
I would have asked her what is the meaning of "to be unburdened by what has been"
Why does she keep saying the word burden throughout this campaign? Like it's comical at this point
But did she grow up middle-class?
Wow thank you Brett for doing this interview,she did not answer the question,what a Joke .Am ready for former President Trump45 to be future 47  one more time .this is just sick 🤢 to my stomach that VP Kamala Harris can’t answer a simple question 🙋 wow 😮
Is her ear piece working. 😅
WOW!!!! 1 minute in, and the disrespect already started. He asked her a question, and wouldn't even let her answer it. Crazy! SMDH 🤦‍♂
Bret really doesn’t know what she’s talking about.  Why? why?
Finally an actual interview, accept she didnt answer a single question
I don’t know if I’m trippin but if you look at her part it looks like she’s wearing a wig
A credible journalist asks a question and then shuts his trap.
What the fk was that
Has anyone ever wondered how many cases are the "asylum judges" handling and ruling on every year? How many are denied? Should be 90% because that is a common number. So lets say 100,000 cases per year (would be low count), why aren't we seeing or hearing about 80-100,000 people deported every year? Is anyone getting deported at all? We never hear about these numbers and cases being processed.
Has anyone criticizing Kamala actually heard Trump speak? The guy never says anything intelligent.
Failed to answer any question
Doesn't she understand she can't blame trump for the past 4 years? She can't win on this platform. You can't win the presidency blaming someone else for everything you have your hands in and not have any type of plan.
This is the first time in my entire life I have seen a Democrat asked a difficult question
I don't think she actually answered a single question directly.
She cannot answer a question to save her life!!
13:21 Why does she say we when referring to herself???
I think we Americans have a question about Harris and her ability to run this country
How the hell is she even in the position to run for presidency? So incompetent. I dont even know if she is competent enough to be a fortune 500 middle manager
She hasn't answered one question?
Vice Presidents have almost no power to create any policy.  If that was true tell me what Pence did for us as Vice President?  I’m waiting….
Not one question was answered.
Harris was in hiding for 3 years were was she these last 3 years?  She was MIA.  SHE IS WAY UNDER EXPERIENCED AND SHE IS A NARCISSISTS A LIAR AND SHE STANDS FOR NOTHING.  SHE IS A DANGER TO ALL OF US.
What the heck are you talking about!!!!!!!!--
this commy B  never answers a question.  and everything is Trumps fault..  this commy has had 4 years to fix stuff.  they only make stuff worse.
How many times does she say “TRUMP” ??
Does she have her microphone earrings on again?
Questions she answered: 0
Is she allergic to answering the actual question?
To begin with, a very very direct question was put to her ( how many illegal immigrants), yet she, as always started to waffle on. I'm thinking, just answer the question.
I wonder if Kamala is voting for Trump, she can't stop talking about him.
What’s with the fake accent at 8:40?
Just answer the question... Kamala! You keep going around, chasing the wind...
He is an experiment
Funny how come Ukraine don’t need congress but Americans can’t get help without them ???
13:20 who are we?
Everything is Trump’s fault! …….. she can’t give a direct answer to a question!
Yet another interview where Harris doesn’t answer a single question
After this train wreck...how could anyone still fall for her non-answers
She’s so unlikable….. so ANGRY! She can’t answer a simple question… she rambles on with word salad.
How does giving a $25,000 grant to people buying a house bring housing costs down? That's going to drive housing costs up...
Can you let her speak? He was acting like a child.
she cant answer one single question straight up.
I just wonder if she is ever reading the comments put against her. And if so, why does she think that she is the best?🤔 Oh! G-d please help Americans.🙏💥
A new generation?  Shes almost AARP age.   That's not what us Gen Z connect with.
Wow, Brett asked some questions - didn't get answers but at least he asked.  And man, Donald Trump is really in her head 😂
😂 Is this a joke? Leader material??? OH GOD help us
What WE would do as president?  Who is "We"?
Dodged first question. Refused to speak about bidens mental capacity.
2 minutes in she's been asked 3 questions and hasn't answered a single one
What are these so called plans?
Seriously she is loopy !?!?!
Does she not realize that she was in office during this whole time?
Let's get to the point... Awnser a god dam question
Does she not realize the major division started under Obama? The worst I've ever seen politics be started under her own parties rule.
Why is it so hard to answer a question honestly because you’re a devil and you’re evil
Why don’t they vet these people why?
This broad.   Are we being trolled here?  Really though,  I’m most excited about not having to SEE and HEAR this broad anymore
Why would anyone vote for her??
They ain’t messing about with her these days, they are hitting her with some tough questions and truths
Why would she agree to this interview? 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Aren’t those the “special” earrings? Those that act as in-ear monitors….
What a prick… Brent seemingly asking, loaded questions and not giving her the opportunity to answer them and continued to step on her sentences before he went on to the next loaded question obviously in chump’s back pocket trying to make her look like she is in adequate what a prick
Is she wearing the same earrings she wore during the debate
This man is soo freaking rude!!! 😒🤨🙄 Let her answer the question without interrupting her each time 😡🤬 Like a true 🤡
I'm 15 minutes in and so far she has not answered a single question.
10:30 why didnt she use any of that experience prosecuting cartels durin her run as VP ? 😆
She won't answer anything! How can that be our leader?
I'd LOVE for her to answer just one question without saying the words Donald or Trump.  I honestly don't think she can do it.
She's such a blabbermouth who can't answer a simple question without blaming trump.
What business have you ran? Or been apart of?  Where are you getting the money for these houses?
She dodged every question
have the smart Democrats left the party?
she can not answer a question without  a self story
So now poor black people can use the internet to go see her policies she will never say in an interview but its wrong for us to have voter ID? how sway? make it make sense please
Love those earrings.  Hmmmm
How can someone talk so much and say nothing except Orange Man Bad?
80 pages on her website but she doesn’t know what they are and doesn’t answer a direct question . Stay in your lane and answer a question without trashing opponents.
Lady you are trying to lock people not Trump - What pseudo narrative are you creating
Why would she do this interview? Lmao 😂😂😂
But all you ask is are you ok? Liar
Why not answer the questions...
If they are worried about the military turning on the people why authorize the dod to use lethal force on citizens?
The amount of restraint she shows while she's being thrown gotcha questions amid other fair questions makes me chuckle 😂
If you couldn’t get one question answered then you are in the wrong business Bret!!! Worst interview you ever had!!!!
Answer a question woman!!
Anyone think she's stupid enough to interview with Joe Rogan, Tucker,  or Glenn Beck also?
Peaceful protests, ask the people who had businesses burned, vandalized, beaten and had family members harmed under this administration.
Fox should be ashamed of themselves. When their maga cult storms their offices I wonder what lies they’ll spin then? You know when Trump loses and the US military turns on him and MAGA finds out reality they’re gonna turn on Trump too.
Blaming someone who is not in office for her adminstration failure is gaslighting.  She is being asked questions that needs answers and she continues to babble and never answering questions.  It is obvious by this interview when she is not given questions before hand, she is not so eloquent or answer questions and keeps back tracking to blame blame blame or shutting down the question.
Does this interviewer love listening to his own voice or what. Let your subject answer your questions, this is amateur hour.
Why does she need Asylum Judges when the border could be tightened and not have allowed the illegal migrants to our country? Why not give more power to the border patrols to Eliminate anyone Illegally entering the border?
Who are these republicans on stage with her ??
Wow!!  She isnt "toast", after these hardball questions,  shes "burnt toast"!!! 🍞
Can this chicken ever answer a question ,brain still under a desk
She can’t even answer simple questions
Did NOT answer ONE single question!
So sick of her lies…. Can she be arrested for her stupidity?
Are all republicans stupid or just small minded
And still no answers...
Still hasn't answered the first question, 4 minutes in. Blah blah blah. No answer for how many have come in under your watch? No answer for do you regret killing "remain in Mexico.  Neither question answered at all.
so now poor black people can use the internet to go see her policies she will never say in an interview but its wrong for us to have voter ID? how sway?
What she turning the page on? She's been in charge in the past 4 years??? What page is she planning on turning??? She is a loser...and sounds like a liar and a loser...she is the "what has been"
What is your plan Kamala!?!? You’ve never mentioned the actual plan!!!
She wears the same earrings for every interview, is that the only pair she owns????  Hmmmmmm
Where are all the missing children????
HORRIBLE HARRIS IS SOOOO STUPID.SHE CANT ANSWER A QUESTION
This broad gets asked about Biden and still answers with Trump
Clearly Kamala does not understand the questions. What a pity.
Great job Fox News hit her with those questions 🤣🤣 and yet she can’t answer them 🤣
I’m confused…. Was Trump president the last 4 years or was Biden?!?   I think she might be confused about who has been in office.    She is a joke!
How many people she let in?
Kamala, little English lesson for you, when you are asked how many then a number is the correct answer. Not your BS
I wonder if she's aware of her own lies. Even if she's not, the American people are.
Question: Answer: Deflect and Blame Trump 😅😂
Is this a real interview or  SNL skit ???
Is she black today or Jamaican today or Hindu today...
She never answer the questions but deflect, deflect, deflects. What a disgrace.
Did Harris ever answer any of Brett's questions?
Ask yourself- Would you hire her?
Why was the question asked, “why are you so angry right now.”
Isn't she better of arguing her point of view rather than focusing on Trump?
Did she answer any questions 😮
She's wearing those ear rings again ? With the microphone .
WHY for the live of God does she Always turn everything back on Trump? Everything? Why? She has NO policy whatsoever?
ask her why she opened the border
How delusional do you have to be to blame someone else for everything you’ve done
Her inability to actual answer a question with a direct response is why woman are not voting for her!
Why is there a comment section on this interview and no comment section for MSNBC commentators. Vote Trump
Can this pathetic woman answer a straight question without drawing comparisons to Trump? The point of a question is an answer. She doesn't get that and she didn't get it during her vice presidency
Can she answer a question without saying Donald trump?
But, how much was going to Ukraine??
Any idea who is forcing him to wrap up and why?
Is Brett always rude or only with women?
Why does she always wear those big earrings when being interviewed?
Where is Trump hiding at his rallies with all the MAGA supporters? 😂😂😂😂 She is here facing the evil.
She got cooked 😂 No Joker like laughing this time lol. He hit her with real questions too. Nice
17:00   Worlds  biggest dodge of a question!
So rude. She won’t let him finish his questions. Didn’t answer anything
Democrats, aren't you upset even a little with Harris as your nominee?  After all, you weren't given a chance to vote for a nominee.
When they ask Trump/Vance about what their administration would do, they talk about policy. When they ask the other guys the same questions, they talk about Trump and tell you to look at a website list.
Finally someone with the balls to give Harris some hardball questions similar to what Trump gets from the media. Kudos Brett. She dodged almost all the questions.
He constantly interrupts her when she is in the process of answering the question. Lousy interview on his point.
Can she answer ONE QUESTION without bringing up Trump??🤦🏽‍♂️…. That tells me all I need to know
Such a rude, beligerant person...and she NEVER answered a single question !!!!
If she goes after criminal's then why isn't she or Biden or Obama or the Clintons in JAIL
Is the mentally unstable threat to democracy in this room with us?
Bro if you're gonna ask a question, you gotta give at least a chance to answer. It's not like the other guy who's immediately off with the fairies
Lets just get to the point-  no lets just answer the dang question-  something you can’t do Kamala Harris!!!!
Can she give just one straight answer to a question He was basically asking her yes or no questions she never gave an answer Will not straight answer anyways
She’s a joke . AGAIN, she won’t and can’t answer simple questions.
All she did was keep filibustering she was constantly talking over him never giving him a chance to complete a question you can see the incompetency in her
Kamala what time is it?                                  “Trump”
Is anyone else screaming at the scream?
She can never just answer a question yes or no
So, I guess we all wanna know if Cheeto’s gonna make the next debate match for another whipping! Or is he gonna Chicken out 🐔! 😂
She just will not answer a question
Her questioning Trump’s mental health while telling us for the last 4 years that Joe Biden wasn’t going insane is so funny 🤣
You can’t ask this lady the time without getting a word salad and making it about Trump, and she still won’t say what time it is.
So she answered nothing
This woman still CANNOT answer a direct question with a direct answer. Smfh.
which ear yall think her MIC is in?????????
She's not answering the questions at all...dodging
Did she regret cancelling 'remain in Mexico?'...never answered the question
Isn't there any woman qualified to be president?
She’s filibustering.  That’s not an answer to the question.  KH, you all had and have the authority to put that policy back, you don’t need Congress.  Stop blaming DT for your incompetence.
Why did she undo successful border policies?  She’s full of it.
this guy is really good at catching her yapping & making her shut up & listen to the next question. good interview
when is she going to actually answere just one question
She is the enemy within. Quit trying to manipulate the question.
How’s it feel to be asked real questions?
Why does fox torture themselves and be humiliated? 😮...
Geez... Will she ever give a straight answer?
Redirected all prodding about Biden’s decline to Trump. What’s she redirecting for if there’s nothing to hide about his mental clarity? 🤔
She is not clear
Why are they hiding the negative comments?  Google owns YouTube?  I hope Trump splits them up like MaBell phones of the past like the monopoly on our minds that it is!  Go Trump!  Make America Great with us and for us all even the misguided folks that think this failure and cheater who fraudulently won her first political position is the answer!
Madame VP can you tell us number Kamala: let me get to the point  😂😂😂😂😂
Does she even qualify to be a presidential candidate? 😂
Good for him confronting her and asking the right questions.
Good on you Brett putting her on the mat and jumping on her bs sidestepping if all your questions
What’s wrong with his face?  I couldn’t concentrate on anything he said with that plastic botoxed face.
She can’t answer one question!
She is an absolute lunatic!  She cannot answer the question!  She just responds with word salads and lies.
Multiple choice questions. Answer choices: A) Right answer B) attempt at the truth C) Donald Trump Her answers were all “C”
Why would she do this 😂
My god? Answer a flipping question.  She told them to come. Own it. Take responsibility. She is a politician and not a VP or President.
Why is Trump Putin's bestie, and why did he sent him personal deliveries of rare materials in 2020?
Why can’t she admit Biden was turning into a potato?
Never a straight answer after a question. Except 1 got a direct answer. And it was so dang true it was scary.
Did she ever actually answer any one of his questions?
Best part was when Brett asked her when she noticed Joe had lost his faculties!!! 🎉 I was waiting for this!!! She doesn't even realize how telling this is to her character and how nothing she says can be trusted!!!
Why did she not fire Biden as VP she had a duty to call him out ...
LOL, do you owe the family an apology - no no no
She has no clue how to actually answer a question.
Have any of y'all looked into the info she talked about? Suckers and losers, huh?!?
This interview creates more questions than answers.
She dances around every question???
o m g! answer the dam question
Madam vice president, which do you consider to be your greatest strength, your own policies or the fact that or aren’t Donald trump?
Hummm, so will the new administration keep cocaine out of the Whitehouse?
Great job by Bret Baier to follow up on questions.  As a trial lawyer VP Harris was trained to ask and evade and no one else has pinned her down like this.
Wow she started evading the questions 10 seconds in. It's like talking to chat GPT when you mess up the prompts.
Why doesn't she ever get specific about her “plans,” for the economy????
no answers to any of his questions, just more democrat pablum!!!!
is it just me or does she wear the same earrings every public appearance now?
She can not answer a question coherently! Ramble and ramble to consume the time and avoid a real answer. This country will be pitiful if she is elected Presidential Puppet!
What makes kamalie think homeowners want the value of their homes to go down??
6:30 what's her OF?
Is she wearing those same blue tooth earnings lol ! You go girl 🤡
How many times did she say his name 😂
I wanna see a list of people she has prosecuted.
LOVE KAMALA!!! Why does fox ask a question then talk over the person when she tries to answer?   GFC you invited, let her answer!!!!! 💙🌊💙🌊💙🌊💙🌊🌊💙🌊
Deflect, Deflect, Deflect - like when a parent is trying to get their teenager to answer a question they’ve asked…
She avoids answering the question she doesn't answer the question a waste of time to talk to her get rid of her
She is not the one answering these questions
is she wearing her two way earings???
How do you avoid answering a question or taking accountability for your actions without saying you're avoiding or denying?
Why does she wear the same earrings in almost every interview? Does she not have another pair?
4 minutes in and she still hasn’t the question. Lady!
She's a total moron. She's full of 💩💩💩 on every question!
Anybody know how to prove your not the enemy within, is there going to be a loyalty test perhaps? Maybe everyone will get a MAGA tattoo on our hands just so we know who the bad people are?
Ask about Obama Diddy and beeper
Now that Kamala Harris has come to Fox when will Trump appear on MSNBC? or is he too scared.
20:16 whats rhe democracy in getting elected and not voted in????
24:13 the question was what’s the biggest threat to the US, not Israel smh ! 🙈
Did anyone do a word count on how many times she said “Donald Trump?” 😮
This woman takes a lifetime to answer simple questions. Come on lady. We all have things to do and decisions to make. Neither one of us have time to waste.
how difficult could it possibly be to prosecute gangsters?
What is she talking about...??? Seriously what is she talking....
Are they actually yours..?
Is there a person on this earth that is a worse presidential candidate than Kamala Harris? Seriously I can’t think of a worse one
They can't have a conversation because she won't answer what she's being asked.
Yesss!!!! Thank you so much for asking her these question!
You mean the border bill that would have sent money overseas for a war that is not our own?
3 minutes of me anxiously waiting for her to spit it out and answer the question... Tough crowd, rightfully so.
Was that an interview? She simply can't give a straight answer. The queen of dragging out absolutely nothing.
pretty much avoided answering any question
How many times did this loser say Trumps name??   A little obsessed I would say.
What do you mean by “you will follow the law” ???? That’s not an answer
HOW CAN SHE BRING SOLUTIONS TO ECONOMICS ISSUES  WITH HER BACKGROUND AS A PROSECUTOR? NO RELATIONS ON THIS TWO ISSUES.
Is she getting paid by the word?
No answer about gender transitions in prison
Is she really wearing those earrings again🤦🏼 Bluetooth earing you can buy online
Can she answer a question?
What about Hurricane Victims
Hey Brett, why did you edit the trump video, and leave out the enemy inside comments? Hey Brett, why were you so disrespectful to the Vice President of the United States? Hey Brett, stop with the facelifts, you look weird. You interrupted more times than I’ve ever seen from you. Sad display of journalism and gotcha politics, you have made yourself irrelevant.
What is she talking about?????? Any body some body i am absolutely seriously what is she talking about??
How much did they need to edit this one too
She answers nothing god save American from this woman!
I wont explain everything im asked about in an interview so go to my website instead 🤡
Why can't we share this on IG? Weird
She answers nothing god save American from this woman!
How tf do u invite someone for an interview and not let them finish their questions?  VP Harris did a great job of correcting and redirecting
This is what happens when you don't get softball questions and she clearly cracked. Trump this and Trump that was all she could do 🤣
Why does he keep talking over her? It’s so obnoxious.  She handled his act really well and will be able to handle similarly hostile world leaders like Putin.
Martha Raddatz was harder on JD Vance than Bret Baier was on Kamala.  Wonder why that is?
Who funded Iran???
Bret asks a question but then rudely interrupts her mid sentence?  Over and over same thing! At least she got some facts out. Also her website where she has 80 pages of detailed policies.
Isn’t it funny that Harris only has one pair of earrings?
There should be time limits on responses. Brett asked solid questions but came off as interrupting her response. The problem is she word salad all her response to milk the time.
Can she answer a single question? I can not continue to listen here. I cannot stand listening to here. I am just going to watch victorious secret show.
Answer the dam question!!!
Someone ask her what is 1 + 1, i want to see something
How come stupid people lead America?
Let’s see how she gets out of this question about Joe Biden’s mental state…. Then she points at Donald Trump
Still voting for her but she ducked tf out of immigration questions and Bidens mental competance
She didn’t answer questions and instead it was what about them though. It’s not about someone else’s it’s about you so answer the question.
Answer the question!  All we wants to do is run out the clock!
Why would she have 80 pages of things she will change about America? Does she fundamentally want to change America  ?
She does not answer the question.
The fact inmates are given options for tax dollars to pay their transition costs and medication etc….what are we doing as a society? Meanwhile public school is a joke, single mothers can’t afford food, seniors can’t afford medication…..  Sorry, nope, do the crime do the time…no extras.
She is NOT a person who is worried about losing an election. Its as if she knows she has already won this election. Ask yourself why
What a dumb bltch, all she knows how to do is talk and whine about trump and give the same word salad answer for every question.
It’s like watching the campaign with Zack Galifianakis &Will Ferrell lol She is dancing around the question 😂
Where is our nation going with this woman( I hope is a woman) that has zero sense of the state of our nation.
Can you plz answer the question??
Is this a deep fake?
I don't understand how her years as VP and 33 tie breaking votes. She did nothing. And everything is Trump's fault. The Biden & Harris administration is responsible for the current economy and policies that are in place. Nothing was done
HUH,just answer the question ?
Was FOX this tough with Trump?...nah, just softballs that he could not even hit.
Does she have the same bluetooth earrings on that she wore during her debate with Trump?
Let's see, she's tried deflecting, ignoring, interrupting, scolding, and shrilly calling out Bret's name like a testy school teacher...all in an effort to not answer damming questions and to instead give insupportable nothing burger answers
Ok Lady...what's the plan???
She can’t even answer a dam question !
Yep, same transistor earings, I wonder who is in charge whispering into the ear of this puppet?
Great questions, great delivery Brett..that women however is a bafoon!
Sorry for her loss? What about sorry for letting you down about what horrible job I did with the border.
How on earth did this woman become VP???
she never answers she goes off topic
Has anybody noticed that Kamala is wearing the same “earrings” that she wore in the last debate with Trump?
Burning down cities?
But why can't you answer the question about the economy.
Who is locking people up if they dont agree with them?  The Democrats.
Where’s the southern accent?
Nice Botox job Bret! Did you get a reference from Matt Gaetz?😂
All she has going for her is talking about Trump. What can she do with using his name??? I’d love to see an interview with her not say his name once.
Bah! She did not answer ONE SINGLE QUESTION ⁉️
I wonder if it’s physically possible for Kamala Harris to ever speak the truth.
Good God O Mighty!! She can't seem to answer a simple question. And when she's got an escape route her only reply is TRUMP.,.,., Wow, no surprises here .,.,.,.,.,<.,
She sounds like joe biden jr. Are they both taking the same stuff?
She can’t answer one question. She just yappin
bro can’t just answer yes or no to simple ahh questions
Lol word salads why ?
Does a lying liar ever stop lying? Evidently not.
how can anyone vote for her after the past 4 years?
She's wasting time and as usual not answering the question!! Second question
What is the point of having an interview without answering any of the questions?
How did the Bushs' regular Americas survive 8yrs of Clinton and 8yrs of Obama and Trump's GREAT America get utterly destroyed in 2 1/2yrs by a senile Biden who doesn't even know his own name?   Not so great
How can this be our leader?
I thought this interview was to be about her and what she can and has done? Not bashing Donald Trump!
Ain’t she from India?😂
What is she talking about!
This is scary. She can’t answer a single questions she just talks in circles to try to confuse the listener.
Why does she keep moving her hand like that??? All she’s doing is mimicking Obama. I just picture her practicing in the mirror with that hand.
Did anybody else have difficulty seeing this? The video kept pausing, stopping or skipping to the next video.
Do you know how many votes she would gain if she just took ANY accountability. Her more than any you can see it’s all a weird act
Why do you people find it right that your country gets rich at the expense of other countries,to an extent you even dictate as to who has a right to get rich or not!
Did she even answer one question?
How did she ever end up in politics
WHAT IS THE PLAN!? She keeps talking about a “plan” but hasn’t said what that “plan” is!
Is just me or does she seem dumb and dull.
ANSWER THE QUESTION!!! Answer the number he ask you.
That transgender surgery stuff was during Obama administration and became a part of Obama care if I remember correctly? Wasn't it written into Obama care?
A scorge what the hell is a scorge
Brett asked the questions we wanted to hear and she diverted and had no real answers.  Excellent.
The questions came to fast for her earpiece to kick in😂
I like Brent He asks the right question for the people. Same earrings 🤔🤔
Bro she didn’t answer a single question
She NEVER just answers a question posed to her!
why does she ALWAYS have an insufferably smug expression on her face?!!?
Does this women have any idea what the difference is between truth and lie?
Just answer the dang question my God
Can this idiot answer a question without blaming Trump?
wow - way to not answer a single question - and pile lies on lies on lies
She was grilled for real.
Lol I love how Brett didn't allow her to walk around a question for an hour.
I have one question....Who planted that bag of marbles in her head?
She still can’t answer question
😂 does she even understand what he’s asking? Or she’s just refusing to answer the question?
What exactly is broken with the immigration system ?????????
Good god she doesn’t know how to answer a question
This woman cannot answer even his first question without repeating her tired old lines.
She never answers questions, its either she's mentally sick or she's having memory problem....
Oh is she wearing that pair of earring 🙏😇
I have no words my Lord.
Where are her children? Oh, right, she doesn't have any to know they are left starving in our streets.
Please please please…unburden me from what has been ! Plus it’s a interview,not a monologue.
is she so sorry she would drop out?
My god she can’t answer a single question
Bret, you asked me a fairly simple yes or no question, and it's unfair if you don't permit me to take at least ten minutes to answer it.
Has she answered a single question without trying to shift focus to Trump?
Is Obama on the other end of those earrings?
She just drones on and on with vague platitudes hoping the viewer forgets the initial question she was asked.
Watch her melt 😂😂😂 she can't handle hard questions😂 1:39
You really want this... are you serious.
Is she just a pre recorded set of talking points? Shes not capable of any nuance? Seems like they need to come up with a more capable robot🤣.
What is this? Is this normal on FOX??? It was supposed to be an interview but keep cutting in when VP is talking. I am tired of those lower class behavior. Be professional.
Why didn't he brought up the illegal alien rate during trump and now
Those earrings, once again. Wonder who's in her ear?
Well then, tell us exactly what would be different...   You can't do that, because there is nothing you will change.
Why let her finish? Do they let Trump and Vance finish on any interview on legacy media?
Anyone else catch the bogus stats about the “direction of country”? 79% say we are on the wrong track??? Footnote says “652 likely voters”… please don’t tell me you polled 652 voters and are trying to make it sound like 79% of the country believes we are “on the wrong track”. What kind of clown journalism is happening here?
They was a Real Interview. Asking The Hard Questions!
General question:  Something, something? Harris answer:  Yeah but, Donald Trump...
9:35                      stuck...................non answer.
She NEVER ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS!!
We want to to hear it from the horses mouth? Why your actions aren’t in line with your words
She's so hard to listen to OMG just answer the fking question!
Why is she funneling money to them through proxies.....
Is it just me or does she sound a bit tipsy ?
This is a democracy? I thought it was a republic?  My 80 iq  can’t keep up obviously.
She dodging his questions left and right..she gotta stick to the script to survive lol
What about Harris letting go Priests who abused children ..in San Francisco ..
Those are the same earrings from the debate
Harris can not even answer a simple question! She is NOT even qualified to be vice president, let alone a president. God help us.
Where is the evidence where Donald has said these things from south africa
Whose idea was it for her to set herself up this bad? lol.
Woman stop talking about Trump & answer the question with knowledge
Can she answer a freaking question? How the hell can I vote for this special needs campaign.
Do you regret? The answer was? I am waiting.
Good lord she just wouldn’t shut up answer the question instead all she can talk about is Trump she need to just give up listening to her makes my head hurt 🤦🏾
Kamala is so good at lying. Are Americans really that stupid to believe her?
Lets be real is anyone on the fence? We know what they both want and what they both bring to the table.
Ask her about abortion...I want her to say she will "follow the law".   So frustrating😢
They should let her talk. Why does he keep cutting her off!!!
Where are these unedited clips Kamala?
Can the guy let her talk? Geez, he tried so hard to twist the facts.
She always beats around the bush and never answers the question or she will interrupting when he's asking one. 😡😡😡😡
Wow that sounded more like a debate instead of an interview…. If I were an American I’d be voting trump ❤️🇨🇦
Great questions!! Nothingness in the answers!!
What clip is it then tell us
Again she can not answer the questions and always bring it back to Trump she takes no responsibility yet speaks as though she is she is a disgrace anyone can see she is just a word salad lunatic ... and thats from a rural Australian omg what a joke of a pretend leader
Not a single straight answer... Pure deflection the entire time
Did she not know who Brett is? Brett would treat Trump just like her.
So hard to listen to her. Answer the question and get to the point.  We are SICK of your antics.
So how are you going to be different from JB? Well i am (physically) not JB. Wow
You wouldn’t answer Brett so I’ll ask it too. Why doesn’t 76% of the country think you and Biden have done a terrible job???
Why she kept blaming Donald Trump while she and Biden are in the office?
To republicans—what did she struggle with
Thank you for finally asking the important questions! 🎉❤
She STILL cannot answer a question 🤦🏻‍♀️ She represents a horrible leadership.
Props for her showing up for an interviewer that won't cater to her but desperate times call for... I can see what people mean by 'word salad' and another word for that, 'denial' or 'lack of accountability.'  How can you trust someone who never takes ownership and plays blame game with every question?
She didn't answer anything. She has a talent for skirting around questions I'll give her that.
How about old parents that can’t afford health care and groceries?
How come she continues to wear the same earrings?
Anyone else notice how this idiot NEVER directly answers a question? She has absolutely no clue and has no answer; she only knows how to go around a question by pointing her finger at Trump. The only threat to America is Harris!
Question is-  how much money has she spend on ads to lie about Mr.Trump!!!!
Not even wearing the erring she is doing good, but can she stop using these or other earrings when going to interviews nor anything similar….? The similarity is too striking…
Does Harris know how to speak instead of repeating old speeches over and over?
Omg can she even answer one question that is asked without 10 minutes of nonsense, and not even answer the fkn questions
This woman is incapable of answering a question directly
She cannot answer a question
Not one single answer for even the simplest of questions. So much diversion and lack of responsibility. Vote her out.
is she wearing the same earrings as the debate? she sounds like a straight assclown
Thank u Bret for asking real questions and not let her continue her filibuster BS 👍
She have a earpiece on again? If she did wow they are terrible as she is
What has she done for the last four years?
Never a single direct answer.  Word salad always.   This is what we have coming.  People will be in the DARK for a long time in the future.    Why are we Americans paying from our tax dollars for all these immigrants?  Why are we.americans paying for other countries wars etc.?
Are these economic experts who claim her economic policies will be better for the economy the same experts who claimed inflation was going to be transitory?
Anybody else notice she had the bluetooth earrings on again? The same ones from the debate...
Please let me finish avoiding answering the question! Kamala's answers are absolutely ridiculous word salad
Good hard questions but he’s interrupting too much. Let her mess up on her own
So...when texas put up Constantine wire why did the federal government remove them??????????
She refuses to answer a question honestly. She is deceitful and a lair.
How is your polling close. What is going thru American people's mind is this what you want for a president?
Why csn she not answer a question without blaming Trump
She hasn’t answered a single question
We both know what we're talking about😂 no i don't know tell me please
Is this an interview or a debate with Trump with Brett's masked face? He wanted to misrepresent Trump's comments that she caught him red handed. Use your brain.
And what answers has trump  given?  You people act as if your blind she held her own and she's very knowledgeable   unlike trump yet you all hold him to nothing I think you all are brainwashed by trump
He should ask this vile woman about the bus loads of paid actors that show up to her pathetic events and speeches? And how much do they get paid? And is it tax payer money?
Where is the question about censorship?? About Ukraine? About the 800 us bases around the world
Can you imagine having eight more years of that
Why didn't he ask her to take out her ear rings/hear devices
Her non-answers are exhausting
Sooo, bascially a tyrant?
She has not followed The US Constitution, so how would she follow the law?
Why is she unhealthily obsessed with Trump? 😂🤣😂
Do we have peaceful pro Palestine protestors under sleepy zho and Kamala or BLM movement who were rioters and looters ??
How could any one vote for that?
She dodged the immigration question. If it’s a broken system then she has the power to fix it right now!! Did she forget she is the VP.
no real answers
Democrats wanted to fix the problem at the border.  What was the problem in the first place?  Does anyone know what the problem is/was she keeps referring to?
What an ignorant human. Refuses to simply answer a question!  "Unburdened by what has been."   SHE PLAIGERISED KARL MARX!!!
Completely biased questions. Didn't see this when he softballed the orange turd. We saw his bias during the 2020 election.
Is looking down and to the left mean the person is lying or remembering?? She does that a lot
Idk why she agreed to do this interview, she’s really bad at answering questions
Well done Brett - held her accountable to the question, she still evaded them.
Over and over again this woman avoids the questions with a lot of BULL-C__P! Word Salad...feel good meanless phrases...she's trying to be Obama but not smart enough to be another Obama..
So this is the best the left has?
Would you look at her? lol! All tense and irritated. She is not that smily anymore.... finally, they are pressing her real hard!
Big L for the Harris team. Why would they let her go on this?😂im glad they did though
Harris couldn't answer a straight question if you asked her if the sky is blue?   Harris is the walking, talking, steaming pile of crap!  Baier NEEDED to hold her to answer the questions he asked.  He lets of ramble on with her word salads without holding her to task.   The questions are better, but still not making her answer the question instead of lettering her blather on.  VERY disappointed in how Bret let her ramble instead of making her give STRAIGHT answers and call her out when she lies (which was most everything she said).
Why wasn't Biden there   he is the president
Is it a coincidence that those are the same earrings that she was accused of having Bluetooth in and those are the only earrings she wears anymore
Is it just me, or is her right eye cocked to the right??? 😮 even her eye is for the right! 😂
her answers are like a word minimum essay, tons of fluff and filler that is irrelevant to the answering of the question!
More red herrings than in the red sea.
What did you do this 4 years you are in the office?
Here we go again. She refuses to answer the very first question. So dishonest and disgraceful.
What did you do this 4 years you are in the office?
She has been in power for several years.  When does she take responsibility
WHO wants to lock people up for disagreeing??? ummm 🦗🦗🦗They keep saying that about people who are speaking out on social media...
Answer the dang questions Jeeesh
People wonder How Kamala Harris became, The vice president? (Let alone a presidential candidate) But Instead they should be asking how was she even a lawyer, she could barely form a sentence, and is not really good at being cross questioned?
My question to KH is, if you are blaming Trump for blocking the bill, what good would the bill do even if it was passed since the bill  was allowing 1.8 million unvetted illegal immigrants in the US daily?
How many of her people quit her ?
Did she say Trump has “to take responsibility for what happened during your administration” and yet spent the entire time blaming other people for the actions that took place during her administration?
Trump wasn't president during that bill proposal. What was the point in voting him out if he has that kind of power???
Why doesn't anyone in the media or politics know how to pronounce fentanyl? Its not fentinall
He acted like he was working for Trump! Every question he asked was shaded. That’s why I don’t watch Fox News🤮
This person can’t answer a question cause she has no answer when asked she changes the subject and I been asleep for the last 4 years I did not know Trump ruled the US was he president cause he is blamed for this mess she says anyway nearly every question asked was a yes or no answer
did she answer any questions?
No answer about Biden WoW
Why would she even want a job that requires so much responsibility?
Thank you, Fox. Finally someone asked her questions that dont spoon feed her
Who's paying for that
The Guadalajara Cartel felt apart before Kamala’s time why did she mentioned that Cartel?
What a horrible interviewer this man is! Asks a question and consistently interrupts her as she is trying to respond!
those earrings look familiar hmmm 🤨
She's like "How dare this Pleb question me" what a biatch.
Why can't she just answer the question? She keeps playing the blame game. I am so tired of them blaming trump for the problems they created.
Chat, was trump a president during 2020 to 2024?
Interviewer: What's 2+2?   Kamala: "Let me be clear, Donald Trump"
She got issues
So what was the # for the first question? God she is awful
Bret is getting too excited! He doesn’t let her answer the question before he asks her another question.
in the "last decade" (10 years? So 2014-2024) 6/10 years were Democratic  presidencies right? (Obama-Trump-Biden)?
She can't answer a question and everything is Trumps fault stupid women
She isn't answering the question
Is she serious right now?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was an interrogation not an interview!!! Period!  That’s ok. Cuz she can stand her own ground! Like the answers or not she held her own! He didn’t want Fox viewers to KNOW who she was. He wanted to back her in a corner! Agree to disagree!
She is not answering anything
Well done flex news for all the amazing questions
The thing with Kamalas answers is they're so waffled i always forget what the question was in the first instance lmao
I wonder if any of the things on her website are copy pasted like the work she claimed as her own in her book. These crooks need some timeout in a prison cell to think about what theyve done.
Bro, she grilled you. Nice try to twist the facts
She was HORRIBLE! She did not answer a SINGLE question!!!!!!!!
Moves to NOT ANSWER the question/evading, and blame Trump. No accountability! No professionalism.
omg what kind of person is crooked mrs harris .
LOL!!!!! Is she getting Grumpy??????     LOL!
Omg this women can't answer a question.. shes pure garbage.
This was an interrogation not an interview!!! Period!  That’s ok. Cuz she can stand her own ground! Like the answers or not she held her own! He didn’t want Fox viewers to KNOW who she was. He wanted to back her in a corner! Agree to disagree!
Good questions which we want to ask KAmALA!!
Is this an interview or a debate? 20 years ago, Fox's bias used to be at least thinly disguised, but this is just horrifying beyond anything I thought I'd ever see in this country in my life.   I naively thought my generation (millennials) would bring the end of this kind of politics, but I fear this will only get worse.
She can answer any question because she doesn’t have the knowledge about it
She was a prosecutor??? Every case she ever litigated or prosecuted should automatically be re-tried.
She’s a poser fixated on her presentation rather than her ability to answer a simple question. Nails across a chalkboard sounds better than her rhetoric.
She is the queen of non-answers.
Am I the only one seeing the same earrings?
She can't answer a simple question.
I can’t even get through this first question this is painful it’s a simple question 😭
8 min in still havent anw the first question
He doesn’t want a word salad the whole time. Your answers should be clear and concise. Short and sweet. This lady takes a question and makes it a 30 minute answer. Horrible!!!
This idiot cannot answer a question. I agree with Trump. She is dumber than even Joe Biden.
Brett, why is she yelling at you? 😅😅😅
She is not answering the question…. She not being objective… imagine a world leader asking her a question and she not answering like this omg!
Could anyone imagine her having to deal with Putin and him not reducing her to tears?
Why I get this sense of feeling that she genuinely hates Trump?
Does she hear herself? I feel dumber from listen to her talk
They’re still sticking with the suckers line?
Finally, a real journalist asking real questions that she refuses to answer.  The blame Trump derangement.
Wait, where is project 2025? Why never mentioned?
How many people has fentanyl  killed for the last 9 months since Donald Trump refused to let his speaker of the house to bring up to vote, That mmigration policy would have prevented a lot of deaths! Are we holding Trump responsible for all those deaths.or just what's convenient!
Still waiting for her to answer a question…
Geez Answer the Question Witch.
Is she ever gonna answer a question or just keep bringing up trump and how “bad” he is?
The way this interviewer asks questions is to entrap and scald her. It’s not to learn about her plans whatsoever. It’s pathetic... excellent interview to remind everyone that Fox News isn’t News, its Political Tabloid TV
answer the question lol;
Will she be this way with world leaders?
Answer the question, Lady!!!
Answer the question as it was asked. Don't obfuscate something else, especially "let me finish", you never started.
But what was wrong with leaving the "remain in Mexico" policy until the border laws can be fixed in accordance with our constitution?
@Fox News @Kamala Harris Why was lethal force, to include drones now authorized by the military against civilians per DOD Directive 5240.01, 3.3, a(2)(c)(d) on September 27th 2024? See 20 minutes in.
Why can’t she take responsibility for her own actions
can she ever give a single straight answer??
How did she make it this far in life 😂
What about following morals and ethics
Again I'll ask: in that border bill, how much of the money went to our border and how much went to Ukraine? There's your answer why it didn't get passed. The Democrats intentionally made it unpassable.
She'll avoid answering any question by talking about Trump, half of which is untrue and the other half is taken way out of context.
i don’t think she answered a single question
"Bret lets get to the point".....never answers the asked question.   Recites the script.  Man oh man.
Trump only answer questions with lies and me me me narcissistic behavior. Nice to see a US journalist actually anwser question with substance
B@tch never answered a question…… just blamed trump.
She’s so afraid to answer his questions, so she just kept talking words she memorized in her hotel room and didn’t allow him to ask her questions.
Do you owe them an apology? Shaking her head universally for no while saying “she feels awful.”
Is she gonna answer the question
Gee Brett, why do 79% of the people think we're going in the wrong direction and half the country is supporting him maybe it has to do with the millions and millions and millions of dollars that Fox News had to pay for lying about a stolen election and editing clips like you did tonight in this interview!
Why didn't Fox go live online with this interview?  They would have had an audience for it.
She started off with the first question by avoiding it with lies lol.
Why would anyone support, trust or vote for trump, an admitted pathological liar for anything, perhaps the same reason millions still support, defend, trust and believe him, they are Poorly Educated because they listen to fox.
Trump does the same crap… he gives word salad Not straight forward answer to questions , in other words, Trump tends to distract the interviewer!
Lol did she just implode?
She looked like the Hindenburg burning from the opening question
She hasn't answered one question.
Why did he keep cutting her off?
Why she doesn't take Trump's name from her mouth??? The questions are about her!!! She's terrible! Kamaĺa, you're FIRED!!!😂😂😂
Good lord she just rambles on at the mouth and says absolutely nothing in the form of an answer to the question. She just hopes to talk him into submission so he'll move on.
Lots of interruption there. What's wrong with letting the woman speak?
Ask her to take your earrings off and then have a conversation with you
The point of the question on immigration was how many she thinks have entered the country, then talks about a broken border she caused.🤦‍♂️
Kamala pivots  these questions she has no plan.  God bless Trump.
Right out of the gate, she woulnd't even answer Brett's first question!
He wasn't making a point he asked a simple question that you're not answering
Hello from europe.. Who hired that journalist? that was horrible journalism.
Wow… did she answer one question without a word salad full of BS crap? What a joke.
Why do half  of the Americans want Trump for president and don't believer her? Gee, Fox News, maybe it has something to do with you having to pay millions and millions of dollars for spreading lies and misinformation about her and President Biden. Hmmm
That's not an apology.
Why did her administration sick the government on the the January 6th people but nothing on the rioters and people who murdered, burned, and looted after George Floyd? Well????
What's her favorite flavour of ice cream??🤷
Brett needs to ease up on the fillers and stop fvvvcking interrupting after he asks a question
When are we going to hear her plan?  We already know EVERYTHING ABOUT DT
Best question how many million immigrants got into the country while you were/are VP. Bret would have followed up and said “Millions “
where do I sign up to become an illegal immigrant????? I sure could use a ebt card with 5,000$ a month, free college, free health care, free obarry phone, free 400$ a night hotel room, free laundry service, free food 3 times a day, and a free plane ticket anywhere of my choosing, also, imma need a free car to, and while we are at it, imma gonna need an apartment complex tax free of course
I have one Question.  Why was this interview so short??? Who was pressing him
Answer the question
"I was beginning to answer it, the question, is the question, for the question is what it is, and that is a question, and we're trying to solve a problem of many problems of the question, to find a solution for the problem. I'm from a middle class family, and trump is bad."
God help us. This woman cannot be president and anybody voting for it is completely lost she can't run this country and world she can't even answer a question
how many Times did she physically Go to the Border??
Fox News quotes a study from Marquette Law School because it supported a gotcha question.   Seriously???
How can Trump be the negative of the last decade when Democrats have been in power for 12 yrs of the last 16 yrs?
She was stuck when asked about Bidens decline
Is she bruised?  She got beat badly!
She asked for him to let her answer the question, then she doesn’t answer the question.. Come on man!
Kamala has been in the presidency almost as long as Trump was. How is she so clueless?
You already know the democrats thought having Harris come on to Fox would make her look better and then it no surprise just turned into a disaster. It’s nice letting them see how it feels for a change going to an interview that doesn’t give her easy questions.This is what it looks like when she isn’t given easy questions. She can’t handle it
So did he/she answer the question?
What are you turning from Kamala?
Ask Diddy and Kamala were the children are Kamala got paid for trafficking them poor children
How many left wing earmarks were attached to those bills.
She is not laughing now when being asked the tough questions.
U were there in all the rooms lol what did u do is the question. All u did was gave billions of dollars to iran
Kamala did your cat have kittens? Donald Trump had a cat Kamala is it cloudy outside? Donald Trump made it rain! She is obsessed with Trump! I wish she would answer one question with a straight answer!
Answer the question!!!!!!!
Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't "the enemy within" that he refers to more about the crooks & lawbreakers within the government that need to be punished?
The “Contrast” would be hearing you answer ANY question 🤣🤦🏻‍♀️
@20:00 she got pissed because she was scared, she was getting cornered to answer a question. Kudos Brett.
The sound is too quite on this one ?
She did everything she could to evade the questions! God help us.
But what type of family did she grow up in, was it middle class?
Was her plan to out talk the interviewer until she had to go?
The question about "How Many people have been released into the country by the Biden and Harris administration" this number Bret gives does not included the People that got away essentially the people they have never even seen.
Can she answer a question? Lol
It terrible how she can’t even answer a question straight without rambling. She knows the predicament she’s in and all she can do is point fingers instead of taking accountability.
Where the hell is the rest of the interview? C'mon Fox.
Trump supporters are happy that Bret asked questions he never wanted answers to- he wanted to accuse and highlight perceived failures in “Her” policies - vp - they don’t make policies.
Trump inherited a booming economy and 8 straight years of reduced unemployment from Obama. Magas, were you aware that trump's so called "best economy ever" was really him riding the coat tails of Obama. Trump's GDP his first 3 years was 2.5%. Obamas GDP his last term was 2.4%. Nearly IDENTICAL.
Even the news interviewers know that she WILL NOT answer, hence, they speak over her and ask AGAIN, their question—the questions the American people all have! Get it together Kamala, you’re a joke and we’re all onto you.
Who pays attention to the cost of an opponents ad if you're not worried?
God bless you Bret Baier for asking real questions!
Finally, a real journalist asking real questions and not kissing her backside. I think this interview could be the final nail in the coffin of her presidential campaign.
Not a single question was answered.  Every single  Response included Donald Trump
The people that got fired?
How ...how are you strengthing the economy?  HOW!  GIVE US THE DETAILS!  BOUNCE IT OFF US! WE'RE NOT AS DUMB AS YOU SOUND.
Just answer the damm question!!!  We’re not here to talk about Trump
Why is it that everyone is acting as if America doesn’t have its own issues with American citizens and crime? Why are they acting like someone crossing the border looking for a better doesn’t have the possibility of being killed by an American citizen. America need to focus on the crimes that are being committed right here in this country first before they start pointing fingers at others. Someone is killed every 11 minutes or less in this country by gun violence. But let point the finger at immigrants. Sound like they are just fitting right in with the rest of us.
Was this easy enough for the cult to understand??? I wonder.
so whats the experiment they're doing on silly old biden??
I like her earbuds, I wonder who’s feeder her information. Wait, no such thing, no way….
What good would more border agents do if you’re gonna tell them not to do their job and they’re going to become border chaperones?
How did he keep his cool interviewing her she didn't answer his questions instead does nothing but bring up trump which has nothing to do with the question. She is frustrating and soo difficult to get a response that is on subject
Question Asked, Answer Pivoted
Why would anyone vote for Harris?
finally someone with some balls ask real questions to this administration
They gave Irsn a ton of money. WHY?
Is she that dumb or she's just acting?
Donny chump would have pooped his pants twice if fox dared asked him hard question like we saw tonight.  Glad Kamala called fox out for the 2020 election lies that cost fox nearly a billion dollars.
The question is she really that dumb? She an embarrassment to women
How ...how are you strengthing the economy?  HOW!  GIVE US THE DETAILS!  BOUNCE IT OFF US! WE'RE NOT AS DUMB AS YOU SOUND.
How can she say the things she says with a straight face?
Once again can’t answer a simple question … why did your administration allow this many people in period .
Did she answer any questions without mentioning her secret crush?
He just let her talk and talk and talk...... about things not even relevant to the specific question.
Do you owe them a apology? YES OR NO QUESTION? 😂 response dodge
Why ask her a question just to start talking again? My God.
All she does s avoid answering questions. She wants to keep talking about Trump and skate around the facts Americans look for to vote for the right candidate.
Way to go brait baier.... We need more people like you to ask factual questions to right people
Word salad much...?
Every interview I have seen clips of KH, she is wearing her debunked magic pearl earrings. Coincidence ?
Kamala: No teleprompter? Hey staff, what’s the plan?  Staff: uh, attack Trump. Kamala: Right.
22:30 how do you trust a woman who is too incompetent to notice Bidens clear decline
I hate how she avoids answering questions
Every question has the same answer... Donald Trump!
She is swallowing hard(shocker) still not answering questions.
He’s being really respectful considering that she’s not answering the question.
Charlamagne tha God wasn’t asking her those type of questions like that this interview is night & day compared to Charlamagne tha God interview with Kamala
Alright, Im suspicious now. This was the first time in what feels like forever a Democrat actually had hardball questions thrown at them.  What changed? Who got the call from Whom? This is starting to feel like a setup...
Why does she keep wearing those fbi made earrings??
Kamala, so why is our economy not strong? You’re going to strengthen what you weakened? That doesn’t make sense
She gave a runaround to every question
Is she in mentally fit? None of her answers are matured and clear
Who is running country now?
How is this woman in the position she is, is beyond my comprehension
There go those famous “earrings” again I only been watching 2 minutes and him bombarding her the Way he is, is perfect cause he’s causing chaos making it difficult for her to listen in. He’s not giving her time to process what’s she’s being told to say by the numbskull on the other end. 4:45 she shat herself at the question.look at her face
😳this need shown to shown at the ballot boxes she literally doesn’t make any sense she just talks in circles and doesn’t even answer the question
Funny, the much touted democratic system the US tried to bring to China produces a mediocre candidate like Kamala who can't answer a direct Q without having to point blame on Trump. I wouldn't want to waste my time voting on such candidates. Mediocre at best, dishonest at worst.
More non answers and Trump bashing, but no substance as to how she will turn things around after almost four years of failed government policies that she was a part of. 🤔
He was so insanely disrespectful. Asking a question and then not even keeping his mouth shut long enough for her to answer 🙄 Of course he had to talk over her the entire time; he didn’t want her to actually give facts.
Is she running for president of isreal???
A supposed law school graduate doesn't know America is not a democracy?
Let me be clear? But nothing clear yet from your mouth
She just dances around the questions with unimportant blah blah blah; she's running the clock.
Has anyone else noticed that she has worn the same exact earrings in every single interview??
What the hell is the forgivable loan?  I've never been in a bank that features these.
why doesnt he just say it?  She keeps saying decades?  He was a president for 4 years of the last 12?
Thank you sir! I always ask that question. What is she turning the page from? Herself?😮😢😅 She's been in power for almost 4 years now 😳
Always talks about a plan but what is it?! lol
Finally. Some real questions. Some real journalism. Pay attention CNN, ABC, MSDNC.
She still not answering questions, instead she wants to avoid answering by bringing up Donald trump and do more lying.
Skip around the question, then blame a bunch of stuff on Trump.  Same ol song and dance.
Is she wearing those same bluetooth earring?
Answer a god dmn question !!!!!!
Is she ever going to answer a question?
Here's the question for brat bear, How come you didn't mention the economy which is the number one issue?
Omg she drives me crazy 😢she cannot answer the question straight 😢
When is Trump's interview?
Let’s get to the point and answer the question Kamala!
Why is she so pissed off? Bless it.
What percentage of her staff left her?
I hope those earrings hold up.......Can you answer the question KAMALA?????. What a mess!!
8:30 you can tell she is holding back tears. Never in her life has she faced questions like this. Everything she’s done has been handed to her.
Are those the same Bluetooth earings she wore during the debate???
I wonder why she agreed to do thsi
I thought it was a soft interview. .
her sound so much like a job interview
Is this a Babylon Bee skit?
WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS TO HERLSELF?  She can't even get through a friendly interview!
where is the hour interview???💥💥💥
How many times she mentioned Trump?
she's had 4years trump has had no power for those years how can she blame trump she has no remorse
She Never answers a question. Just blah blah..no answers
Lie ask the military
How yall Red hear alot about her PLANS m POLICIES but always complaining about u don't know her POLICIES AND PLANS?🤔🤔😂😂 Dummies
Is she even listening to herself?!?
Why isnt the man the hero that found the pipe bomb at the DNC ON JAN 6TH RECOGNIZED AS A HERO KAMALA? DID PLAN A GET SWEPT UNDER THE RUG?
notice the change in cadence of her speech when asked about iran 23:33 .. almost like she was being fed that answer through an ear piece
How many times does the vice president bring up Donald Trump’s name can I get an answer?
Why is YouTube making this video so hard to find?
How do you lie and say nothing all at once
What a terrible person she is.  Regurgitating debate lies and talking forever spewing nothing in order to not answer the question
Does she even know how to answer a question without twist and a spin?
Does she know how to answer a question vote for trump she is so stupid
Just go back and see her questioning of justice Brett Kavanaught. It tells you everything you need to know who she is.
It would be nice if she would answer just one question
The Guadalajara cartel has been defunct since 1989, how did she do that?
Anwer the question  BT
Answer the darn question lady.
Was this Duck Dodgers in the 21st Century or the Vice President of the United States?  Hard to tell.
Where is the joy kamala?
If you ask a question give enough time to answer!!!
Answer the darn question lady.
Tell her why did she not fix it in the past 4 years?
Wait ...Trump was only in office for 4 years. The Dems over 12 years
About time she ,the goblin got some proper questions
These are very tough questions everyone is asking but, if there was ever a moment to answer to all of these videos and change minds this was it. And I think she failed. I think this is the true moment she lost the election.
So are you... on the ballot, the question goes to your character, honesty...which you didnt answer
What is this send military out thing?
She's clueless! Didn't answer the question.
She cannot answer a question. There's nothing in her head
Kamala, why don’t you deport those criminals who crossed or crossing illegally right now? And fix the border now?
Besides just disliking the way she talks, what issue do you have with anything she said? . . .
How connected is Kamala Harris to the World Economic Forum?  History shows quite the buddy buddy.
Question: If Trump is as bad as you say then why is half the US supporting him?  Kamala: This is an election for the president of the United States. Its not supposed to be easy 💁‍♂️🤡
She won't answer the question.She evades the question totally.
I'm so glad people are actually asking her questions though that she don't want to answer
What Republicans are supporting her?
Bro how do Americans find hope in this woman? 😂😂 Do you realise your president has to deal with other leaders as well as warlords, even African states dont respect her.
She never gives an actual answer to any question ever.
I'll take nonspecific answers to every single question for $100 Alex.
Finally someone asking the right questions!!!
what did the democrats doe to trump from day one ?
Why does no one talk about  100 billion went to Israel and Ukraine and only 17 billion went to the border in the bill
Why is she always blaming trump ? 🤔🤔🤔
Count the number of times she dodged a question. It's at least in the double digits 😂
Does she ever answer the question ask?
Bluetooth earrings again?
Ask her which salad dressing she wants with her word salads and she chooses all of them
You tightened up penalties for illegal crossings?
She can’t answer a single question.
If someone asked her what is 4+4 equals it would take her 5 minutes to answer.....
Why does she keep talking and talking and not say anything? It's a question that needs a simple answer. She has no idea how to weave like President Trump! This is just so bad!
What was so Democratic about her being named the presidential candidate instead of being voted to be a presidential candidate?
What's with the ear rings?🎧
So when is Trump doing the Rachel Maddow interview?
Where's the dunce cap when you need it?
We should ask border patrol agents who they plan on voting for.
She’s got a plan. WHAT IS THE PLAN DARN IT?!!!
Brett thanks for asking her questions. Again not one answer.
Where was she when i needed to write an essay on a book i didnt read in 3rd grade
How do you go to a job interview and talk about the competition most of yhe time?!   It's YOUR job interview, ma'am!
Where was she when i needed to write an essay on a book i didnt read in 3rd grade
She’s never clear
Lol, why is she so angry?
How many times did Kamala say Donald Trump during this interview?
The dems have so lost.  They won't take it lying down.  What trouble are they going to cause?  What are they going to do - God knows they're up to something.
Imaging trying to get answers to our most important Questions and get this for 4 yrs, yikes!
OMG! How the hell did this person get on the ballot?
Look at how ANGRY she gets over simple questions, Donald Trump never got angry like this🤣 she will get us in a war so fast.
Hangry or angry? I can't tell.
She is a rude b*****.  She has never answered a question.  She is too busy blaming others for what she has caused. What an idiot 🙄
Same old blue tooth earrings and same old kit answering the question. Not the leader I can vote for. A cheater and a liar that just gaslights everyone.
How can anyone vote for her? She dances around the questions like a ballerina! Can we just get one clear answer without all the mumbo jumbo fluff?
Why this guy don’t even let her talk ???
What happened to her accent?
I wonder if this dunce realizes that Trump has been out of office for years. All she/he does is blame him.
I wish he would have at least let her answer one question without cutting her off bc I really wanted to know her answer to those questions but he wouldn’t even allow her to speak.
So while you fix the immigration system you just let them illegally come into our country??
Does she think we’re stupid?  Everything she says is the exact opposite of the truth. Everything she accuses Trump of, the Dems have actually done!  This is the bizarro world!
Bret why didn’t you bring up the fact that Kamala did not receive one primary vote.
The real question should have been, will she truly ever be unburdened by what has been?!
What if her and Hillary were running against each other
Shes wasting time with her endless  gobbledy gook thwt is merely a distraction not an answer.
She can't answer a question without talking about Trump
Youve had democrats for 12 of the last 16 years. Why do idiots keep voting democrat?
Is there ever an interview where it doesnt end up being about Donald Trump?
Bret: *Asks a question*   Kamala: “Well, Donald Trump…”
Did anyone notice how she used up the time
Excellent interviewing Brett!     Who put Tulsi Gabbard on watch list? Hmm, who is the real threat to democracy?
Did she just call Joey B an experiment? Haha
Who is this woman who does not know what she is talking about?
Can he stop interrupting her? So rude.
😂😂😂 she did horribly. Can't answer basic questions. Not even hard questions
Kamala must be facing tough questions for the first time.
Anytime she does an interview she is wearing the same earrings and necklace AND only during scheduled interviews.... hmmm. Js
Who broke the immigration system? Hmmm. B&H!
How can he sit there without laughing.  Maybe thats why they get paid so much
Where the joy gone Kamala?
This is what happens when questions are not given in advance! If you say that Kamala did well in this interview, you are just plain stupid!
She didn’t answer the question she keep moving around
So being a politician means replying a question A with answer B ,which is a lie, and then deny past actions. Simple.
How is an illegal immigarant a American?
Too bad they don't ask Trump real questions.
She can't answer a single question!
held accountable?!?!? Y'all are too sold out to the trump cult. I was impressed
Cant seem to answer the questions
Is she wearing the famous EARING? LOL
This us so frustrating to watch. She talks around every question, no direct answers.
Unfit and dangerous are subjective depictions.  Is she able to give actual substance?
how  Kamala can be the president of America ??????
So how people do this is not let them talk.... And interrupt them... But yall mad at people fact checking?
Is she wearing those CIA earrings again? She is!! Wow.
She never answers a simple question.
Lord help us if she wins.she can not answer one question.all same speech on every topic.
lol who told her this was a good idea? 😂
She can’t Answer a Single question! 🤯🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Great Questions!! Every single question she shoots back with is donald trump's fault.😂
Is she sloshed?
Bret tried to ask questions about real issues—Kamala did not answer them 😮
Jesus Christ she couldn’t answer a single question all she does is try to use words to invoke emotion out of the American people she’s trying to manipulate as many voters as she can. When trump wins I really hope they make a documentary about her and her failure.
Wow not a single answer ! ….. cant answer one question!
Instead of her wanting to build 3 million free are affordable homes and apartments why doesn't she look at all the abandoned apartments and houses that were torn up then left maybe rebuilt them Instead of wasting all this money plus what is a forgivable loan never had one of those?????? .......
Why does she sound like she’s always crying when she talks
We are talking about ads? Political ads here Wth? Please can you speak your own mind not other folks that hate your running mate? 💯
Not Answering question raised but lecture the anchor, wolf Kamala.
If you have already voted for her, what are your thoughts on this interview?
Can anyone of you Demacrats speak the TRUTH FROM THE HEART. I know you don’t and neighther do 90,000,000 people! SHAME SHAME SHAME ON YOU AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
A lot of questions, Zero answers... great job talking in circles around the questions.
Who was Vice President in 2008? Who is the VP now? Did we have a recession during Trump’s administration? We are on the verge of a depression or hyper inflation… Why tf is Joe Biden still “El Presidente”? We need to stop supporting all these other countries and support ourselves!
cant even watch this   answer the question
I gotta hand it to Kamala…. She faced some incredibly hard questions and almost dodged them all.  That takes skill and intelligence (but unfortunately not honor and honesty).
Maybe it’s because I am looking on my cellphone but I can’t find the 80 pages of comprehensive policy. If you have seen these pages, can someone tell me how to access them?
The question was why Iran is the greatest threat to america not the greatest threat to Israel. These politicians care more about Israel than their own country. Trump and Harris can both run for president or prime minister of Israel and leave the presidentcy to real america first voters.
It's an easy question, how many people illegally came across the border? Bret did a great job, unfortunately she had no intention of answering your questions.
Does she not realize that Obama was eight years? Trump was four Biden was four. She’s an idiot.
Peaceful protest?  Burning down buildings, tearing down historical statues, vandalizing landmarks, attacking police,..... I guess define peaceful Kamala.
OMG it’s like she is taking the 5th on every question!!!
what official position did she hold at macdonalds????? the girl behind the dumpster doing dirty things doesnt count
Wonder what was her highest priority for the last 4 years
Finally real journalist asking question to Kamala the Kameleon. The seat was too hot and she could not hide her evilness behind a fake laugh this time.
where is the dot on her forehead 😤
She is unable to answer even a yes or no question, how tiring!!
Every question literally deflected into a ramble salad of trump accusations
Thank U and BRAVO, Mr. Bret Baier for asking such an important question!
He should have asked if she has a different pair of earrings.
A plan that is sound? what are going to do to stop the exploding 35 trillion debt!
ABC should have done this questioning this way. She never answers questions
she wants to talk about true in every question being ask ABOUT WHAT SHE HAS DONE... Jesus she's in love
Bret only had 1/2 hr to question her. If he had not stepped in, she would have sidesteped all the other ?s by her babbling over one ? Which she still did not answer.
I’m gonna have to go through each question and respond on a video.. because I can not with her lies!
I wonder if Brett is getting the same migraine that I am getting listening to this #$%^
How is he going to ask a question, then cut her off while she is answering the question to ask another question. He had one goal in mind
Do the politicians running for office have to submit to a pre-employment drug screening?.. like she sounds high... I've known stoners who made more sense
She cant even answer the question about bidens health! She sure likes arguing. Notice she has on her pearl earrings again
Answer the question ,,She is Stupid
How much crack is she smoking
Jesus lol just every question is blaming Trump… really bad look.
Is she not in charge now ???
How does she expect to pay for all these things? You think Americans want to give up their taxpayer dollars for other Americans to have kids, small businesses, and new homes? Stupid idea.
What is she freaking out about? She’s the installed candidate.
So what are you offering on Iran?
Such an important conversation. Why should anyone try to wrap it up so quickly? What’s more important now?
How many times did she mention Donald Trump?
Does anybody know  the news that there's a massive people coming through mexico mass migration in the thousands they haven't said anything before the elections
How many illegal aliens have been released into the country? 0:25-1:00 Harris doesn't answer the question.
Is lossage actually a word??? Or did we just get a new tasting salad.
She refused to answer the question about Bidens cognitive decline. She met with him every week and didn't say anything. Unbelievable.
She never gets to the point on any of these questions
Wait...isn't that the same pearl earrings?
She cant help but deflect hard questions
She can not answer the questions asked
Can’t give an actual answer for any question asked…
Wow she still can't answer a ? Only blame me trump lie lie lie
Why wasn’t this live instead of prerecorded?
Would she agree to open the pipeline that they closed??? To fund  all these grandiose ideas of throwing Money at the American people.
How many times does she not answer a direct question ❓
I noticed ads hit right after he ask her a question and the ad is so long, they hope people click off here
Last decade? Hmmm.. 3.5 yrs was Joe, 4yrs Trump, and 4 yrs was Obama.
Decade? Obama and Joe Biden and the democrats owned 6 out that 10 years ago
So, where are all the fact checkers?
Chips and salsa act??? Wow I didn’t know they did so much good. Sorry Brett can’t watch her for more than a couple minutes…
Stupid lady couldn't answer one Question!!! What a loser.  Talks so slow wasting everyone's time!! What a waste of a person who can't even run a 7/11 much less the United States. Step down Loser
Why is a home wrecker word salader waffling about home buyers 😂
She answered nothing.😮
China is probably the biggest threat, if it is Iran, why allow them to sell oil? Allow them access to billions in frozen $?
Why does it seem like she's high?
How did she lie with a straight face?
She thought she was debating the interviewer.
HOW DEFENSIVE IS SHE? THE GUILTY ONE IS THE ONE WHO MUST GO TO SUCH EXTEND FOR COVER UP.
Remember when Trump resulted to racism when he had less pushback in the NABJ?   Can you interrupt your own question more?
Will anything ever not be trumps fault?
oh my goodness!!! can you just asnwer the question?? How can this woman talk to Putin??!
A “biparson” effort? Can’t even speak 🤣
Will she answer any question?
Are those the same earrings from the debate!??
What is so mad about it?? What clown she is !! Lol
Why did he let her steamroll over him? Why didn't he use a loud voice and tell her to stop interrupting him? He let her control the interview.
Kudos to Bret!  Hard, honest questions, none of which this woman could answer. She should be ashamed of herself!
She talks like shes listening to someone in here ear. Look at her last two questions....
How long until dems start calling Fox News racist?
She won’t answer a flippen question.. 😑
Seems like her only plan is to never actually answer a question
I wonder if she’s gonna do this with Putin
Can we get a translator?
She never answers questions directly.
She’s such a MORON! OMG… I can’t believe that she’s the Democratic nominee.. she’s can’t even answer a basic question.
7:19 who’s fault is it? A man who was not in office?
This is supposed to be an interview and she’s treating it like a debate
She can't answer any queations without demeaning Trump, and that is not an answer, it's avoidance. She's a genuine idiot.
"What are they, stupid?"That was an interesting question!
Brett is doing a great job asking tough questions!
She didn't answer one question with a real answer
Well, just exactly IS your plan?
Has anyone been swayed to vote her way after this interview?  What is she trying to do - chase the voters away - 80 pages of policies?? Really ....
Can somebody count how many times she says his name?
Is fox a republican channel? im asking cause all i see is how awful the woman is im not sure either one is fit for office both are compulsive liars and lie about everything I don't like her or him but i tip my hat to her at least she had the guts to go on there i guess not sure how it will or if it will impact the race but hopefully I'll dexide who im gonna vote for by the 5th
Too late for any theatrical interviews, even this one where KH wants to duck, dodge, lie, and manipulate the interview questions.   Not answering and then deflecting back to the previous President, who had nothing to do with the biden administration of which you were a part of.
This is like watching  Saturday Night  Live . What a joke this lady is . She can not answer  one question.
Asking a question, then taking over your guest as they answer is a bad look for a journalist no matter what network you’re on
How to be asked 25 questions, and not actually answer one.
How many times did she say Donald Trump?
Is it true that Amazon pays no federal tax?
She is the queen of ignoring the question, avoiding answering the question and rambling on about nothing!!
Are these national security experts the same ones who said the hunter biden laptop was fake? Inquiring minds wanna know.
Man, it’s so painful to listen to her. Talking in circles around all the questions he’s asking.
super slow is she listening to the tele prompter ? word salad again she wants to gain time for result of fewer question , just shut up! no substance or whatsoever, ultimate lier, shes there to answer some question not to tell bunch of word salad, she looks so evil, you only have 30 min !
First question - Kamala isn’t given the space to answer. Constantly disrupting her during her answers, this man is not a gentleman, nor is he professional. Terrible interview skills.
How can they watch her and listen and feel she is capable to the President.
At 1st Trump didn’t follow the laws & he was bad for the ppl, now you following the same laws he was ?? LMFAOOO the chick is slow 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Did anyone ,ever have someone, in your life make you feel sick just listening to their lies?  Well know I have a swollen right side of my face and a very bad tooth ake.  She needs help!  She is insane, local!
Every answer is a non answer to the actual question with a Tsunami of it's Trump's fault and a twist of word salad.  Imagine this moron at the helm of the worlds super power🤦🏼‍♂️
29:39 Avoiding the question. HA! Suckers and losers. DEBUNKED LIE!
Does she still have those Bluetooth earrings on?
How many republicans are honest with themselves as to the power of trump being president for 4 years vs Harris being VP for 3.5??? Do republicans hold Pence accountable in the same regards as Harris?? How much power do they think VP’s have?? That’s only if they’re actually being honest with themselves!!
Why can’t she give hour long interviews like Trump?
it's not a debate kamala.  it's an interview and he is asking question. AND SHE IS NOT ANSWERING. her strategy  -  talk word salad with no answers until time runs out
First question - Kamala isn’t given the space to answer. Terrible interviewer skills
Soft ball interview man republicans need to ASK HER HARD QUESTIONS
I think Brett spent more time talking than Kamala. Is that how interviews work?
Can she not answer a question without mentioning Trump?  Trump this and Trump that.  Please answer the question VP Kamala.
4:00 do people really believe that she tried to close the border when she scrapped the wall?
She won’t give a number. 6 million? 15 million? 20 million?
could not respond to the first question about math in three minutes. remember, this is the no child left behind lovers that would fire you from your min wage labor job if you couldn't do it
Thank god finally someone not giving softball questions an as you can see she is not at answering the tough questions. How can you think she will deal with world leaders from other countries who will constantly try her!
This was almost a real interview
Finally! Super good job on asking the questions, even tho she can’t answer any of them.
She must be told to remove her ear rings whenever she does an interview. Funny how she now wears the same earrings every day. I know she has more pairs but why is she always wearing these same ones every time she speaks now……cause Obama is talking to her through them. She can’t talk without them.
The enemy within?????  That would be you.....she is out of control!!!!!  Best questions ever with not one clear answer!
Close the borders till we repair our immigration system. Instead, let millions in we might fix the system later on.
What was that?? He asked a question and three words in he talked over her. Trump has no answers and you can’t hear her answers because he wouldn’t let her talk. Politics have become a game to the media when real live are at stake. I’m so glad there is a true and living God
Just me or she doesn't say anything of substance?
Bret asking Scumala for a NUMBER, and she giving him the salad with heavy sauce!
Wheres her accent?
Why are they in such a rush to end the interview?  Why not make it longer?
Hats off to you Bret! You asked the tough questions and held her toes to the fire. This is the type of journalism the people of America needs. No softball questions. The only thing she's sorry about is agreeing to this interview. 😂 All she did was dance around questions.
Oh my gosh.  Can the women just answer 1 question.   Just one????
6:50 what the F?
The American people KNOW and have SEEN the truth! No one believes her! She looked like a deer in headlights!  I question her ‘AG’ career!
Didn’t Obama give Irán like $450 mil cash his last day of office?
She just can't answer the question. Cannot. Will not. What else do voters need to see?!
Let’s see Trump go on CNN or 60 minutes and have to answer questions. Oh wait he just backed out cuz he doesn’t want to be fact  checked 😱😳 imagine that
Can you let her answer the question?! This is not good interviewing…but totally on brand for Fox News.
How many American men stalk women and the judicial system let them out to delete the same women that they were stalking. What about that?
Unclear why she came on here? Madam VP was drinking beer and laughing it up with Stephen Colbert while many states on the eastern side of our country were in crisis. Some states like North Carolina, Louisiana and Florida are still searching for their missing loved ones. Her true intentions have already been revealed. She also shows time again that she does not have her priorities in order; she prioritizes identity politics over the true needs of the majority of the American people.
They tried the “gotcha questions” and failed on all of them lol KAMALA 2024!!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Ask her about Willie Brown!!!!!
Why she never answers the questions?! Can she ever get to the point.
Finally someone tries to make her answer instead of her skipping answering. Just answer the question without too much added. She’s was an , she knows how to answer.
Can she not talk without wobbling her head 🙄
Just answer the questions!!!
She kinda got grilled..good job fox..
This lady will not answer a question, everything is trumps fault, she is perfect every answer is trump and I got to be honest it's straight up werid.
What about the pain the American People are experiencing due to her & her adminstrations incompetence.
She still clown non skill non answer ... Last decade trump 😂😮
Doesn't she own any other pair of earrings I have seen her wear those earrings for every single interview... just saying it makes you wonder
The man asked her a simple question and she's so hostile from the first question, she's not accustomed to being challenged and her real Evelina personality came out.
Not a good interview. Very weak on Brett's part for not taking hold of the situation.  Ask yes or no questions not let her filibuster on topics not related.  Bad interview.  Nothing learned.
What has this administration done to bring down costs?  Wages are stagnant, inflation is out of control and no one cares about her word salad.
All she has is memorized lines. Then she just takes one or a couple of those memorized lines and plugs them together for her answers. Nice to see a real journalist hold her feet to the fire and ask real, serious questions.
So no matter the question Harris is just going regurgitate lines  off the same speeches she reads 20 time a week.
Again she is not answering the question asked
Is she wearing the same earrings she wore at the Trump debate? Some people questioned if they were audio earrings.
Gender surgery for criminals and abortions for everyone. Is this really what America has become?
Why does she wear the same earrings that look like the ones that could  transmit  what to say to her.  It would make sense not to wear those to avoid  speculation..... just saying ... we are not stupid.
Bret, it was so hard to watch someone struggle so bad with such important questions.  She is waaaaaaay over her head here.  Without picking this interview apart, this is how she handles things when they are not scripted.  Well done sir!
This woman can't even answer a direct question. It's so frustrating to listen to her. She has, which she so belligerently pointed out, some good ideas. But... the ideas will never see fruition if she wins this election. It makes my head hurt to listen to her. Bravo to Bret for reigning her in for most of it.
Wait Donald Trump was in the White House for a decade? Lol the dude was in a the White House 4 years ago… what is she talking about 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I've been watching for 15 minutes and she hasn't answered a single question
Thank you Bret for asking the hard questions to her and calling her on it.
Will she ever stop lying ?
Well well well I think she handled herself very well here I love it it’s like a one on one debate ♥️🤍💙 💜♎️😇🌎
Are we electing a psychologist or a president? She is not telling us things she will do
So why are you trying to divide us
So much question avoidance… that was incredibly bad for her
She just did not know the number. I question if 6mil is accurate. I bet is more!
how about jo biden  avoid the question
That’s wasn’t the question could have been repeated to every response given.
I want a president that doesn't deflect every question they've ever been asked.
She can't answer a question for nothing, she's so so so stupid
Why the hard stop?  Fox or Kamala limit?  Her time ain't that valuable.
So, when she steals this election and she reopens the flood gate, will she continue to blame everyone else....
I want the world to see more of her interviews. I also want to see shameless democrats watch her make these speeches. I now wonder who is more evil - harris or clinton? Maybe democrats know it better . I vote red.
80 pages of policy yet all she can talk about is Trump?
Great questions, she does not answer, she is losing
Do you think she wears a thong?
The whole what would you different question is dum. LBJ wasn’t just like Kennedy. Why would she be the same as a white man 30 years older than her.
I'm embarrassed for her. She finally is asked some questions and she gets pissed.
Great question Brett yeah kakakmala why answer. if donald is hated then why are Americans voting for him. Tried of listening to this.
Answer the question
Does anyone remember last year when biden=harris "accidentally" sent iran 180 million to iran?
ask the question of January 6th
Then how come there is more billionaires and millionaires who are Democrats and Republicans?
Why is nearly half the country supporting a prolific liar, a wannabe dictator, a rapist and a convicted criminal?  Good question, says a lot about the intelligence and how informed and aware many Americans are.  Its as though morals and conscience don't matter anymore, very weird.
is this communists first answer a filibuster or just an extended word salad?
What's the over-under on her IQ 70 or lower??
Why does she wear the same heavy ear rings in every interview…seems kinda sus😅
Are they the only pair of earrings she owns?
Wth is she talking about???? 🤪🤪🤪
How about Kamala's staff ? What staff?
When did sec change become medically necessary?
She can’t answer a single question except talk about Trump.
She nevers answers a dam question 😂
She is a master of answering questions without quite literally, answering them at all.
she feels awful ! wow, is that an apology? NOOO
How long does it take to give an answer does she know its only 30min 😅😅
She would have spent all the time on one question if he hadn't interrupted her. That was her strategy - to give one of her long-winded speeches about how much she hates Donald Trump, and call it an answer. Fortunately, he managed to interrupt her with great difficulty, so he could bring her back to the question or get onto the next one.
Answer the questions. This is an interview.
Did her and her people think going on fox news would help?
We're a democracy??? I didn't get the memo!!!
This interviewer keeps interrupting….let vice president Camala answer
Can we all be unburdened by her stupidity?
Flying in 40thou from TX border to CO is FIXING IMMIGRATION? Telling citizens what they're lived experience is their "IMAGINATION" denying this WHY? Read Denver Gazette.
Brett doing gods work. Finally she gets hard questions and a journalist does their job
She can not answer simple questions especially when she is lying because she can't remember what lie she has said.
How many times did she mention Trump?
About time someone gives her the questions to which we need real answers.
In the war between “facts” and “clear as mud ‘word salad,’” who’s the winner?  🤔
This is like asking a litterbug why there's trash 🗑 everywhere.
This imbecile can't answer a single question without going into a word salad that isn't even close to the question that was asked.  T R U M P / V A N C E   2 0 2 4!!!
The question is, how did Donald Trump secure the border? Ist true that Donald Trump used executive orders not a bill,
She gives the longest non-answers that I have ever heard. God help us if she gets in there somehow. It will be bad
She didnot answer one question- deflected every one!
She didn't answer the question "why is half the country supporting him?
Ask her if the Hunter Biden computer was from Russia.
Why no hyena kackles?  Reality sucks.
Can she answer the dam questions? Or she is clueless? I guess the latter?
She can actually do interviews
She’s grasping at straws I’ve listened to almost all his rally’s and he never said he would set the military on the American people that don’t vote for him.  He s going to go after the swamp ox Washington DC
What is she talking about
Why the f@ck was Fox News so stingy with their time?  Couldn’t their gold and catheter ads wait a few more minutes to let Baier and Harris finish the interview?
What is she talking about???😅😂
Dude! Let her answer the questions without cutting her off constantly.
Ranch or blue cheese with that sir/madam? 😂😂😂
She doing her Filibuster preamble and never answers direct question asked.... and didn't apology to Moms who lost their child or cared..... good day
Americans pointing fingers at each other? That the dems entire strategy. Divide then blame.
She did great,  kudos for her although they were trying to use the old gotcha questions.
If Iran is the greatest threat to the US, why did Obama give Iran $400 million in cash to Iran, and then follow up with $1.7 billion in bank transfers. Later, under Biden/Harris, they sent $16 billion to Iran. And then $7 billion in military equipment left behind in neighboring Afghanistan? Or, did the democrats give Iran money and access to weapons to create a pretext to invade?
Trying to hold her to a question or stay on subject is like trying to catch a lubed up Diddy after one of his parties.
What about the people that have worked with her and they resigned? About 90 percent say she's unstable and mean.
They wrapped so fast. What a disaster she is when faced with real questions
She filibusters so she doesn't have to answer the question.  That's her Hillary training.
WOW!!!! This woman just can't answer one single question, pathetic, a true politician 🙄
how could she wait this long to do this interview. must not have been ready
Good job Brett way to actually ask some relevant questions and hold her feet to the fire she just proved that she is still a idiot even with the microphone in her ear again telling her  what to say
Why do you keep taking down what I comment on YOUTUBE? No freedom of Speech HUH?
Can she only talk about Donald trump? answer something?
Have she answered any of the questions?
Can she answer a question without using the word Trump?
It would be nice if she could answer one question, but we know that won’t happen.
Can anybody else tell that she's still on script memorized but she still on it
Does she not realize we are already in a recession?
How is it that she’s always wearing those earrings for these interviews? Clearly an earpiece
What burnt Toast looks like yall.
I don’t think she answered a single question
Does she answer any question? Asking for a friend?
Did i just search for Trump interview or Harris... im so confused
Jeopardy question: what is a filibuster? Answer was what you just watched. The enemy within was sitting across from Bret
When she is asked a question, her answers are blamed Trump
Who in their right mind would vote for this woman?
Is anyone not sure now?
Man, I’d just ask her what do you stand for ? What do you believe? I think American people deserve at least that to make a decision. I heard a lot of deflection instead of honest answers
Was that e real interview with real questions… can someone tell me  I’m not sure it’s been years since I seen one 😂😂
Does she not realize she’s the enemy within ?
Why hasnt she done it in the 3 1/2 years?
What prosecutions did she conduct? Been a few people looking for records of her in court
"Fixing" a Problem that she created?  Seriously?
last decade?  Trump was only 4 years of the last decade.  Get a life.
Just like a dem, evade the question. Vote red or we are dead.
Everytime she can tell where his question is going she tries to filibuster
Why do you care about how much money he spending? It’s his money.
He won’t even let her answer his question. Kamala is not someone I would want to go up against
So what is the fing plan or plans. No on  has heard them
By the time she finished talking, you forget what the original question was.
Did she answer a single question ? All she was doing was eating up the clock , and rambling to avoid giving answers and trying to control the convo .
She can not answer a question to save her life, she also is responsible for all those deaths of the young women. She is useless.
She’s not clear about anything
Does she only have one set of earrings? $2 000+ suits but only ONE set of earrings? 🤔
He's rude. She was answering the question. He's a bully. She always remains with integrity and truth.
21:49 bruh just answer the question yes or no !😭
She didn't answer one question. If you can not answer the question she is unfit
Some how everything is still Trumps fault? After 3.5 years? Can’t even say a sentence without blaming something on trump smh
What are your plans still have not heard them......
Answer the questions Kamala
Has this chick been fed Bidens med's ?
This woman genuinely didn’t answer a single question
Almost 5 minutes to answer question with a number and at the end she didn’t answered the first question. Nothing new!
she can't answer a question
It is maddening and infuriating watching her dodge answering to these questions.
Anyone else ready to be unburdened by what has been?
She literally danced around every single question.....
I thought this was supposed to be an interview ?  This was more of  debate. And how disrespectful talking  over the VP to push the propaganda of your media outlet.
Why did Bret let to control this interview? He did not let Donald to do that,  I don't like Bret at all
She sure is breathing hard on some of these questions
This woman can’t answer a question to save her life
She is so bias. She gets angry when pressed on answering the question.  She says the boarder is a problem but won't admit to it being a problem.  She can't talk gibberish and her attitude is showing.  😂😂 what a joke
This seemed savage, but they really were just normal questions
I worked really hard to pay for my house now I need to work harder to pay for someone I don’t know for their 20,000 down payment?
Finally they ask her real questions. But she doesn't own up to anything.
Why is her voice not so urban tonight lol or with a Latin twang! She’s using white voice tonight guys lol!
Finally someone asked her tough questions and she flopped so hard lmao 😂 this is why they wanted so much control over debates and interviews.  Got that A$$ this time!
I want to know who told her it would be a good idea to take this interview? 😂😂😂
She starts answering the question about the bill and he immediately cuts her off and tries to speak over her at @2:00
How is it that so many liberals develop this nasally, whining voice?
Was this an interview or an interuption?
From an outsider looking in, what has this woman done for the American people while in office, besides identifying as a female & being a woman of colour? Asking for a friend.
You let this clown talk word salad to ur questions! WHYY!????
how many legals have you allowed in to country is the question answer the question
Best interview ever. Finally someone who ask her questions and again she can't answer
Thank you for the REAL questions Brett!!!
Why don't interviewers ask VP Harris about the people who worked for her? And question the actual detailed cases she prosecuted in CA. Proof?
All she does when answering a question is to try to run out the clock with as many irrelevant words as possible, but he wouldn’t let her.  Good for him.
when will she realize that she’s being cut off so much is because she’s not answering the question the the reporters aren’t stupid.   oh wait it’s Kamala
About time that someone asked the real questions.
Can you pull up a graphic showing all the Republican senators that voted against FEMA support for coastal communities? All of deaths out those good Southern folks are on the Republican party.
Avoid the questions
Mental incompetence is not being able to understand a question and trying to answer it with another topic.
Then why did you let them in??
Was anything actually answered?
Who and why did they stop the interview?
Why can’t she answer even one single question?
Harris on the hot seat and Bret was the right person to ask her those hard hitting question’s that no other person dared to ask.
I hope some people watching could see past the loaded questions and are brave enough to vote blue! We can disagree and still live peacefully brothers and sisters!
The affordable housing the $25,000 Boost all this promises I got one question who is going to pay for it?
Has a Presidential candidate ever been THIS devoid of substance?
How many have been released Harris?  Answer the *** question.  Stop circumventing with the bs nobody wants to hear.
So why is there a catch-and-release?????????????? kakamala.
Great questions! Even with every answer being Trump 😅
Asking her any question is a total waste of time,not even one straight answer.
Not Kamala avoiding answering questions
It's funny how on each question the common answer is . . . Donald Trump!!!  Even though he HAS NOT HELD any OFFICE in the last 4 years.
Nice questions. Let her speak tho. Trump 2024
25:38 What happened here?
She's got her debate earnings on.  :(
She cant even answer the questions!
She's got the debate ear rings
If only she knew what those policies were.
Dancing around the questions.
If only she knew what those policies were.
Freudian slip about Biden ... "experiment" instead of " experience"
answer the question
answer the question
Do the Americans need another 4 years of idiots like her and her boss Joe
This is insane. Someone tell me one question that was asked that she actually gave an answer. All I heard was attack trump and nothing else 😂
What kind of journalist ask a question and doesn’t be quiet to get an answer. He is very unprofessional.
Great job Brett! She can’t answer a question without blaming Trump!
Kamala too used to softball questions and rigged interviews😅
So everything that happen this past 3.5 years was trumps fault ?
Trump reminds us of the age old question.. what kind of man sues his hookers? 🤪
What has she fixed in four years? Absolutely nothing, system is nearly broke
Who pays for this.
Kamala doesn’t answer a simple question then why she should even run for president.
Just answer the questions woman. She's so full of it.
"What if anything" is always gonna remind me of depp vs heard😂
If she gets this upset over an interview, how could she handle a governmental crisis?
This was an unmitigated disaster, there was not a single straight answer to some very important questions
Does anybody have a tally on how many times she said Trump’s name?💔💔💔
why didn't you fix it
Why did Americans remove Trump? It was for change, right? But in the last four years, there has been no change—America is getting worse and worse. There are so many wars in the world involving US ... and then that woman comes here telling us 'Trump this, Trump that.... Just like a kid
Why would Biden sign all those executive orders BEFORE the bill passed?
Dodges every question and pivots to orange man bad
She didn't answer the question. Wasting time, will waste more time.
Look at her getting so aggressive over questions.And you think she can run the country fofh
Did we just witness a political self-deletion spreedrun?
@20:55 Who’s the unstable one!?
Brett Baier is a fair and neutral interviewer.   She was given softball questions all this time.   These questions were not tough or hostile.
answer the question
Answer the question for the love of god! Why is she even an option?
She got pissed. It's the first time she was actually asked any questions 🤣🤣🤣
1:34 This is the best the Democrats can do?
Just answer the question "Border Czar!"
Who is voting for this nutcase?
Kamela doesn't answer one question clearly
Does she really only own that one pair of earrings??? 👂 👂🔊🔊🧏‍♀️🤔
Who was giving him a "hard wrap"?? No way would Fox try to end the interview early, why would they? So I'm guessing Harris' handlers were ending the interview early?
Dude “for example:” then says absolutely nothing … $25,000 for a house? Ha sorry California! 🤦‍♀️
This hoe can't answer a single question. Let me be clear... Is this really the best person we could produce to lead our country?! Vote Trump and get this trash out of our government!!
If she cant even sit with a journalist without getting wound up how will she handle herself with world leaders?
She never answered a question. She always tried to twist it to Trumps fault.
Brett could have asked at least 5 questions to everyone that he did.
they have been trying so hard  to lock trump up so what is her point! and they locked up many people from jan 6th but nobody from the blm protest/riot... ugh i really hope people see right through her!
She can’t answer a question
I’m not mad at his hardball questions. I am mad that he kept over talking her and not allowing her to answer.
All of this while TRUMP gets softball questions. For example why did you send covid tests to PUTIN!!!!!
Answer the questions
Who’s unstable? It looks like she is to be honest, look how she gets so mad
She's so rude. She interrupts and overtalks with nonsense, anyone that asks her a legitimate question. Passive aggressive, draws the foul, and then acts like a victim.
This guy did not even allow her to answer his question!  He is so rude!
Ask her why her husband slapped up his ex wife and got the nanny pregnany.  Ask her why Tim Walz pulled a Diddy on those little boys around the time of his DWI in 1995.  Ask her why she plagarized much of her book.
SHE NEVER ANSWERS A QUESTION, JUST LIKE A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. She straight up sucks.
Why doesn’t she talk about how the first paragraph of that immigration bill was to give funds to Ukraine
How are those earrings working out for you now?
And you wonder why the Democrat party is whispering civil war the world is watching vote Trump Vance 2024
I actually feel sorry for her. I believe lawyers don't care, so it might not matter so much to her, but what could she say that is true and exonerates her?
Gee Brett why don't you ask those people why ???
Projection at it's best 🤣 can't answer one question without talking about Trump
Why did he let her weasel out of the Border Bill question? It was a Ukraine Bill with some provisions for the border. That's why it was voted against by Republicans.
She is getting testy because he’s going back to questions    she doesn’t answer and asking them again. But he is letting her get away with a lot of crap.
Let's not get to the question...
Where the Jamaican accent mon??
Brett hopes Kamala got out what she wanted to get out? And that they invited her so viewers can get to know her? Meanwhile, Brett talks over Kamala when he/Fox doesn't want the viewers to understand what she's saying. Fox is trying to prevent Kamala from getting the truth out. But she held her ground and got it out.
The way she answers the questions, the pace and intonation in her voice, as well as her posture and microexpressions, indicate that she is being fed answers through an earpiece.
Joe Biden is not on the ballot? It seems to me he was throughout the Primary...
Quit deflecting and answer the questions Scamala.
The past decade???! Uhhh the past decade has been dominated by democrat leadership....what world is she living in?
How does she look at herself in the mirror?
Can we get one question answered ?
Amazing reporting!!!! FINALLY A REPORTER ASKING THE REAL TOUGH QUESTION!!!  TRUMP 2024!!!!
Weak Questions.  Man...... Nothing about abortion, Communism, Socialism, Afghanistan pullout, Trumps assassination attempts, AI use... All these answers were memorized and deflection. Don't be angry ppl, if they "win".
She has her "Ear Piece" earrings on again.  I wonder who's whispering into her ears.
Question: why most of people likes Trump? Because of Fox News.
Lol Marquette law school poll?!? You reaching Deeeeep fox
Trump's plan weakens economy? Really? Sorry, Americans aresmarter than that! Turn the page? She has more than 3.5 years, now turning her page? or what page?
This made me so happy, good job Brett, Thank you for actually asking her real questions bring the facts right to her lying face
What does the thing mean with the slip, " when we're president"??
Shes not answering the question so frustrating
"Will you let me finish!!!" Proceeds to not answer the question. She's great at playing the victim and is perfectly ok with not letting Bret speak
Finally we get to see her take some difficult non softball questions.
How much booger sugar is she on? Wow, talk about nasal drip
3 minutes left and she still hasn't answered a single question.
What about the laws that were CURRENTLY IN PLACE?????  If they needed a new bill to close the border, how did Donald Trump bring it to the lowest levels ever.
Is she hooked up in her earings
Does she ever answer a question directly?
She will evade every question. She will not answer. He is going too easy on her.
So, why did trump refuse to do the 2nd debate with Vice President Harris? also, why did trump refuse to do an interview with 60minutes? which, by the way, has been a long time tradition that every single presidential nominee goes thru...trump was the only one who declined it. It's MIND boggling  🙄
It’s Pathetic that this woman wants a Promotion but can’t answer a question. Ridiculous
The question is simple. How many?
Trump has NO plan! Really?
Same ear rings! Is that the only pair she owns?   Look it up they are ear phones, they cost thousands.
WHat's up with those same earings????? Hmmmmmm... seems suspect!!!!
I'm guessing she regrets agreeing to this interview?
How many immigrants?  The point is … you can’t answer the question about 20 million you allowed into the country…the immigration problem is what you CREATED.. so “let’s be very CLEAR!”
This questioner actually pronounced her name rt. Called her madame nice president.  Usually fox is rude. Not here, way to go.
Why doesn’t Trump get grilled like this when he is on Fox? Because he’s an old man that if they talked to him like this, he would just leave 😭😭😭
Think she's better off to move back to California,  ask her  about 10 to 30 thousand on ebt card and 5000 and up ebt card cash , he'll give me one
If Donald Trump was so unfit and dangerous why were we all so happy for 3 years?!!!!!!! And miserable for these 4 years.... Starting with Obama.... Which was gradual  🙏✝️
What about your Diddy parties
@1:45 she fails to answer the question. 'Do you regret changing those policies?'   She refused to answer it and redirected. How does everyone accept this garbagee?
Can she talk without talking about Trump
Why blame Trump when you and Joe told them to come to the border before you were elected?
They need a segment where they can only answer questions with only yes or no for 2 minutes .
Wouldn't even let her answer a question before trying to throw another question in
He did a good job asking non dodgeball questions that makes the absence of answer staggering.
Why is he cutting her off every time she attempts to speak?
Still not answering the questions.  Lying wench
Are you guys watching her other interviews besides this one? Or you’ve already made up your mind so at this point it doesn’t matter to watch?
What has she done in the present administration??
Great job Brett. Actually a journalist who  asks hard questions.
So deportation of illegal immigrants that commit crimes is deporting Americans???! They constantly demean Trump and call him a threat to democracy. They have jailed people who disagree with their policies. BS!
Just wondering, could she answer a question if her life depended on it.
She deflected direct questions more times than she answered them
Please check and see if she’s wearing an earplugs. I’m wondering why her right hair doesn’t move at all. Hmmm
At 12 minutes in she has not answered a single question. We will see how the rest goes.
They were softball questions.. the question he should ask , why don’t you close the border now ?
What about when she called people 18-25 stupid?!
Who is locking who up, Kamala?
She always refuses to answer the question.. exactly the sign of people who are deceptive deceiving.. does not want to be caught lying.. 🙏✝️
The Iranian question shook Vice President Harris: the unscripted, authentic presidential candidate Harris voters want to see for months!
She's so awesome!!!!  Vote blue!!!!  Ask me why?  GO KAMALA GO!!!!!
Anyone have a count on how many times this idiot said Trump? If I were taking a whiskey shot everytime she said his name, I would die from alcohol poisoning!
This lady hasn't answered one question, with an answer in the whole 2024!
She is wearing same earrings from the debate someone is helping her to answering the questions
She never gets to the point, she goes around the block 5 times to answer a simple question, yet still avoids it. She’s so arrogant and rude!! She’s a dictator!! Steer clear!!
Who are you in last 3 years?
SAME EARRINGS.... right?
Do y’all think they’re just actors and it’s a script and the elites run ts they are just actors and making a real life tv show for us and putting how stupid Kamala Harris is right in peoples faces then laugh so hard when people vote for her
Always tries to blame Trump….just answer the dammmm questions!
Answer the question, please!
I don't think she answered one question
she did a great job of dodging the questions
Answer the f#@king questions lady!
I wish she would answer a single question.
Harris if you support Israel how come you did not meet with Israel leader when he was in Washington but you did with Ukraine leader. Not fair!
It's funny watching a woman get asked serious questions that need serious answers
Ask her what she wants for dinner,  women can’t answer that either.
She still doesn’t answer simple basic questions. And she is wearing her “debate” earrings again.
What does clear mean? Im confused
This feels like a rather odd interview...
Trump is totally unfit and insane. Question: What about Biden ? Ohh Biden is sharp as a pencil 😂😂😂😂
Brett, you are a journalist who asked tough questions to someone who has been spoon fed easy questions,  thank you for exposing what they are afraid of, THE TRUTH.
She thinks just because she rambles on and on the real question will be lost in translation and that I'll suck up all the time so he wont be able to ask another question or hopefully forgets or gets to a different question she brought up.👎🇺🇸
is she reading from something, why isn't she looking at him LMFAO
Here's my question, if as Kamala Harris, says the Joe Biden is on the top of his game and making sound decisions, why then did the DNC, Congressional leading personalities, such Pelosi and Schumer, and theparties elites push Joe Biden off the ticket and insert Harris in his place?
From the beginning, she immediately started not answering what was asked and instead told a long story😂
She does nothing but avoid answering the questions and flat out lie.
She is pure garbage.  She thinks above answering questions.  If she would answer the question a quit the typical word salad.  Complete and total garbage human.
Kamala is awful answering questions
And some people think she is President material?   Baffles me.
She never answer number 1 or number 2 questions. She just keeps going on blaming anyone else instead of answering the question!!!!!!! WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE LEADERS OF OUR COUNTRY. PERIOD!!!! We are better being a supportive role, NOT leaders. Deal with it women!!!!!! You KNOW IT!
Has anyone actually gome to that website and see the plan?
Is she ok?  Very scary.
What is wrong with this guy? Was he raised by a pack of wolves. You asked a question. Let her answer the question.
When are you going to call Har on her lies about Trump??
Her body position seems EXTREMELY guarded.  What does she have to hide?
Fixing a problem? You’ve been doing since day one is creating the problem now you want to fix it laugh out loud that’s like me slapping you in the face and then pretending like somebody else hit you and I said I’ll protect you next time.
Do you Trump voters understand he wants to forcibly remove millions of people of color? Do you realize Trump will send military into US communities and literally forcibly enter thousands of homes and arrest them detain (possibly in internment camps) or just deport people?
Ask Kamala what 1+1 is and she will take 10 minutes not to answer. 😂😂 The Evader.  She thinks we are idiots.
This dumba## hasn't answered even 1 question
I was wondering she'll be yelling Trump's name while sleeping
I thought Trump built a wall. What happened to the wall? Didnt Trump fix that?  Why did Trump then block a border security bill?
Can you ask yourself if you can hear what you are talking about Vice President..?
… those earrings 🤔 … does she have any other pair?
I don't think she understands what questions are.😂😂😂
I am so sick of hearing 'let me be very clear...' followed by convoluted word salad which does not answer the question asked.
So if Biden was 100% why did he get pushed out by you?
And still she can't answer a question. And continues to blame Trump. Same ol , same ol with her.
She's a pathological liar who can't or won't answer a question directly: Filibuster, pivot, lie is what she does.
So....whats her favorite flavor of ice cream?
Why don't she do it now?; how come the hurricane victims have to apply for that $750 and some of them are getting turned down?
Every question...Trump this..Trump that..empty skull.
Whether interviewing Trump or Harris - stop with the gotcha questions. Ask What they will do moving forward in government.
This is not a conversation 😮
Answer the QUESTION DUMBASS HARRIS 🤯
Wait,Wasn’t it Biden who threatened to use Nucks on the American people. As an argument to get rid of the second amendment?
She literally hasn’t answered one question
If Bret can absolutely unravel her, what do you think foreign leaders will do to her?  They will chew her up and spit her out.
Let’s not forget trumps puppet masters are the architects of project 2025, a fascist takeover of America. Is that what freedom loving Americans want?  Women, you want to lose more of your freedoms? People of color who vote for Trump, you want to risk losing more of your hard earned rights and freedoms?
The silence when she is asked a question is so cringe.
Doesn't she look tired?
All that and not a single straight answer to any of the questions
Plan plan plan plan.. what is it exactly
Why is she on the ballet if Biden is fit and sharp?
How does she know he spent $20 mill on the ad. Did her Mainstream Media Cartel give her the receipts
How did she get through Law school??
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS QUESTIONS TO SET HER UP TO LOOK BAD AND AS SHE EXPLAINS HERSELF HE INTERRUPTS HER TIME AFTER TIME HE WONT LET HER SPEAK!!
If Biden is so competent and has the right judgement, why do the Democrats want him to be replaced?
Why wasn’t it 1/2 hours long.
what was that first question???
How the hell could this woman have been a prosecutor?  She can't argue her own case, how could she have argued for the state of CA?
How do you spell arrogant nothingness?  Kamala. Case closed.
Ask her about the plane loads they are flying in
What?
This is a real interview. She is grilled
see who is locking up who? trump is being persecuted by the democrats.. and their rhetoric led to assassination attempts at Trumps life... who is gaslighting who... we are not stupid to see what democrats are doing!!  straight at the communist playbook
First time ever.  First time she really gets interviewed with real questions and she could not handle it
Does she not understand that we can go back and read the transcripts of every different meeting that's been held in office.. we could find out what she really did... if I'm wrong somebody please explain to me how it's done... when she looks down someone is feeding her word salad
Locking people up for going against you?????? Your party madam vice president is the only party whonis doing that!!!!
What  about Willie's wife?
She is a puppet, who’s the puppet master pulling the strings?
This interviewer was horrible. Did he ask her what her plan is?
This is the question I'd like to have her answer:  "If Biden is so competent, so energetic, so spry, so capable, why Madame Vice President, are you even here?  Why isn't Biden still on the ticket?"  Baier got close but she filibustered over it.
Has she actually  ever answered a question?
Hey, Bret - How about learning how to shut the hell up after you've asked a question and let your interviewee get a word in edgewise?
She is not answering the question . What a shame.
Bidens health problems were right in front of her and she couldn't see them ? How can she possibly deal with our enemies and what they are up to ? She needs to be able to interpret body language as a president. Its not all about the words.
How is she still blaming Trump 3 years later
She can’t answer a single simple question. Just the worst. Cannot stand her
Answer the questions PLEASE!!!
Arent they the ones censoring videos in California? Calling for censorship through all states?
20:10 Why is she getting so angry over a question?
It’s so hard to listen to her…does she have her Bluetooth earrings on again?
She is so lost.  Never answers a  question
“What plan? She can't even explain what her plan is.”
Rude . They invited her to ask her  questions and get answers. Not a polished speach and Absolute rudeness!
This is what happens when you don't get the questions in advance nor do you get to edit the tape.
For the first time a reporter ask Kamal-eon real questions, not softball questions regarding the 4 years of terror Americans are living under this demon VP
18:25 ask trump the same question and see what he says.
Why is she always wearing those pearl earrings when she has an interview as well as the debate?
So frustrating to listen to her NOT answer the question!
Where she will get the money for the $25,000 for buying a house?  How could they buy a house if there‘a no work?  Hahaha
Who’s voting for Kamala? ❤
Is there anything she takes responsibility for ? It is unreal that she absolutely blames on TRUMP for everything and he was not in power the last 3 years … turning the page from Trump ! ??? Really ??!!!!
Something to think about: Aren't those the same controversial earrings?
The question is, who was pressuring Bret to end the interview. I'm guessing it wasn't Fox News because I'm betting people could watch at least an hour if not more of an in-depth interview. Does she not want to make her case to the American people or is she too busy for that?
Gender surgeries in prison??? They've lost their rights - what do they need surgeries for?
Bret  should let her answer a question. Trouble interview.
these questions and their 'answers' = magnets of the same polarity trying to touch
She can’t answer a simple “yes or no” question, she’s dodging questions and he’s trying to keep her on track and she keeps jabbing the “can I finish explaining” like no…. Stop trying to cover the questions with answers that don’t ACTUALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION that was specifically asked.
Does she ever use other earrings other than the listening device pearls?
Answe the question at hand
She looks so angry. Where is the joy scumala?
Had 4 years already and did nothing at all. BUT when she gets in office she will?
Those earrings again?
Anyone on here who is now voting for Trump after this interview? Curious minds
she answered none of the questions.
can some please explain to me what she's talking about?
She totally danced around not to answer the question. She's a 🤡
Is he going to let her answer any question? My God he is annoying af.
Why she mix so many words and not answer  the question so is very clear to me I  will never ever I will vote for her
Why they always ask her about Biden like what part of she wasn’t the President don’t they understand
Is she have her two-way earrings in?
I wish someone would ask her why Americans should vote for her when she was aloud to bypass the primary process by her crooked party.
Are those the same earrings she was wearing during the debate? Nova H1’s the one where she is able to be instructed on what to say? Ohh ya it is..
Why does she always blame Trump?  And she is rude to always interrupt. And she never takes responsibility and she has never apologized to those families.  Smh,  thank you fox
Am I the only one that keeps hearing "what has been burdened" in my head, when trying to listen to her speak???
I feel dumber after watching her. Is that what's supposed to happen?
I grew up in a middle class family! What was the question  Btett?
One of ear is not visible...maybr she has a earpiece
Who is voting for Trump?❤
Tell me do you blame Pence for trumps presidency mistakes and policy?
you guys realize the vice president has no control over what bills are passed and cannot take any executive action to create legislation right? RIGHT??
Props to her for going somewhere where they ask tough questions. Not sure it helped but at least I can respect that.
When Brett is blaming Harris on Lakin Reilly where is his concern with all of the people that have died since Trump killed the border bill.  Anyone who has died since he killed the Lankford bill is on Donald Trump's conscious (if he had one).
Allow her to answer her questions
What a joke she is. Cannot answer 1 question
is this her fox news accent ?
Is she wearing those earrings again?
She’s dodging every single question. People have no idea what she actually stands for.
The question is in one world and the answer is in another world
How many black men did she put in jail unfairly?
I the only one that noticed that she is wearing the same earrings from the debate? And pauses before answering🤔
Just answer one question without saying trumps name! Goodness!
Trash. I wonder who brought the migrants here and brought the wall down. Yall know who will turn this disaster around! Trump 2024!!!
Why would anyone take fox seriously after they paid almost a billion for lying? Fox viewers are wilfully stupid
Dancing around the freaking questions and  blaming president Trump for their failures.
Facts? If she wants facts she needs to stop[ lying.
What's up with her pinching her fingers together? She's such an amateur.
Where is she getting the $25k and how?
NOT ALLOWING HER TO SPEAK! Typical trump supporters behavior with anyone! That was a dumb question to ask her how many illegal immigrants have crossed the boarder. How is she suppose to know that answer?? trump supporters are dumb asf and irritating!!!
What about Willie's kids, did you harm that family to,
This Fox reporter is the most unprofessional when asking a question then interrupts her and trying to over talk. Typical male cant handle a female be in a higher position of him.
She is so incompetent. Does not know how to answer a question or even deflect a question the right way. A middle school debate team student could answer these questions better
When is Trump going to do a sit down interview with CNBC and MSNBC?  🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓
She can't even answer the question just always circles around them. What a loser and her voters are losers as well.
The questions he is asking her she looks like a cat that just swallowed the canary
Penalties? 😂😅 B they're flowing through the boarder like water 🌊.
I don’t think she actually answered a single question
She does not appear to such direct questioning in front of a live camera.
She didnt answer one question. Walked around everyone. Bravo to the reporter though. Very detailed questions.
This guy is dumbass ask a question and then interrupts 20x
If only she was as good at deflecting migrants as she does questions we wouldn't have a problem.
Q. Who is our greatest adversary?  A. Iran is Israel's greatest adversary.
ask yourself, who would you rather have a verbal contract with?
I wish she would let him get a whole question out. I guess ol kneepads wouldn't know how a real interview is supposed to go.
did she call him Ben around 2:50?
Kamala’s body languages would give the appearance of a dumb grifter refusing to answer a single question.
It shouldn’t take several minutes to answer a simple question. 🤦🏽‍♀️
11:49 When is she gonna take responsibility for what happened under the Biden/Harris administration?
Good Lord this puppet cant answer a question without starting out Donald Trump this Donald Trump that. The Donald lives in her  so called brain.
If she can now recognize decline why hasn't she removed joe biden for his severe cognitive decline. The fact joe biden is still in office proves she cannot do what it takes to protect this country and American citizens.
Finally, she's actually being asked some real freaking questions.
“You have been VP for 3 1/2 years, what are you turning the page from” 😂The million dollar question!!!! lol
What is this garbage she's spewing about Trump saying he's going to use the military against US citizens, lock up people who disagree with him, and so on?? He has never suggested any such thing. I do wish Brett would have pointed that out. Is someone on her staff telling her he has said these things? Not only lies but the type of lies that lead to assassination attempts. Trump has specifically said he wouldn't engage in law fair. Hillary was a criminal and he did nothing about it. It's HER and Brandon's administration that has tried to lock up Trump.
She "filibusters" every question because she's TOO stupid to answer a single question.
Does she ever answer a question? Wow.
She could not. Answer one question,WOW?📢📢📢
Doesn't let her answer First question and then seques into his bias agenda, with totally different derogatory question. 😔
Brett why are you letting her control this interview??! She has all this rhetoric that takes up most of your interview!
She did very well at the attack  I mean interview 😮
Who the hell would vote for this woman??
She fought back on every single question.
Bluetooth earrings? No plan still
What is her obsession with trump 🤣 can we count how many times she mentioned him? 🤣
Why are we so concerned about (rare) cases of transgender care in the prison system?  There are actually serious issues to address.  Yet instead for some reason we focus on scapegoating.
What about sending FEDERAL RESOURCES TO REMOVE THE BORDER Texas set up????
Q: When did you notice that joe biden was declining? A: why talk about joe biden when trump is running for presidency 😂
Why is She Talking over the Guy and Then Keep Blaming and Blaming Trump and I didn't learn anything about her Policies and or Plans what a Great Joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣 .....
Where's the Harris who can't talk without a teleprompter? Did Fox News lie to me?
she did not answer anything!
She is incapable of answering a question!
She can’t even start by answering the question!
If she wins I wonder how long she is going to keep blaming Trump for everything? Think it will go all the way until she leaves the white house?
She frustrated? 😂😂
This is the first time since she’s been the presidential nominee that she’s been properly questioned.
Finally a true journalist pushing to get the truth without playing games. She couldn’t handle a real probe with a tactful follow up.
She won’t answere a question
Over the last decade ? We went from great under Trump to crap under Biden / Harris .
Glad he asked the Biden question.  She ran away from that answer.
Responding with words that do not answer the question.
Do people seriously want this woman to be president? She's clueless and offers no solutions!
Is ‘clear’ a word she just learned?
Fix housing… how about blackrock stops buying housing driving cost up ? Thats better than 20k for people.
Is this the full interview??
7 minutes in and i see a pattern of, ANSWER THE EFFING QUESTION LADYYY!!!!!!!
And again.... she can't answer the questions she's asked.  Then asked pissed off when he interrupts her to answer the question he asked.
She should of did like Trump and not answer  one dam question
She is exposed pretty badly and is desperately trying avoid the question. First question was how many illegal immigrants? Never answered. This is the bluff Americans need to call it in this election.
OMG! Does this Women Ever say what she’s going to do? She says a Lot, but says Nothing.
Shoulda asked her about that earrings
Brett… Clark Kent call him what you want but this guy is the media hero I didn’t know I needed!! Asking real questions and not backing down.
do you know the innocent colored people that have been killed 2016-2019 under trump administration if not DO YOUR KNOWLEDGE done thinking for you'll tighten up
22:13 Were these the same people that told us the laptop was Russian disinformation??
Does she even know what a decade is??
What exactly is her "plan?" She's just not presidential material. She's just not very bright.
Where was this 💩 head 4years ago ? 🙈🙉🙊
Trump this and trump that but what are you going to do besides everything the deep state and donors tells you what to do.
Little Obama can't answer that one question can she,,, she's getting whispered to with them earrings of hers
She's a big dummy.  Never answer a question
Who is paying for all her proposed hand outs?   Oh yeah, US in higher taxes, great!!! 🤮
Does she own a another pair of earrings? Funny how those pearl earrings are the only set she ever wears when answering questions on any stage, in any location friend or foe.
This is an impressive interview. I had no idea someone could not answer a single question so well.
She can't answer the question 😅
She wants a conversation. She has to stick to the questions and answer the questions not talk what she wants to
Can this H answer one question
Is she running against herself?
OH MY GOSH....SHUT UP AND LET BRETT ASK A QUESTION!!!!!
Why can’t she answer a question
If we blame the former president for everything, is there a need to elect a new president? What can you do as a new president?
Wow!! Did anyone else notice that not one, single question was actual answered?
All she's been doing is getting combative not wanting to answer direct questions as usual interrupting and changing the subject and even more interrupting trying to argue moot points she is not fit for office
What has she done for the American people as a Vice president 😂😂😂
How can people still believe in her omg🙉
Deflect. Obfuscate. Filibuster. Repeat. How is this even close?
It’s insane how she literately cannot answer questions.
Brett was trying not to laugh at how pathetic she is under questioning.
Absolutely inexcusable how she completely avoids answering the question or accepting any responsibility for failed policy.
Why she start yelling at him?
3:54 Wait what? Why did Trump ask senators to vote against an anti immigration bill?
She must be a good dancer because she certainly danced around the questions.
Does trump ever answer any question coherently?
I wonder if she knows how stupid she is?
I wonder if she realizes how unlikeable she appears
Do yall really understand how government work?   Congress, meaning the senate and house vote on the bill. She had 33 tie breaking votes, in which she approved.    She does not make all the decisions, that’s the president, of course she didn’t do xyz because she doesn’t have the power to do so.
She can't answer 1 question. She just wants to bash Trump
Answer the question. Do you support it or not????
Are we supposed to spend the next 4 years listening to these evasive super long non-answers? No thanks!
She wasn’t grilled. She was asked fair questions and didn’t have answers to any of them
Why does he ask her a question and then interrupt her answer and talk over her?  He needs to shut up. He is effing annoying.
When are you people going to finally understand that it's Trumps fault that I did what I did. Aren't you dumb enough to understand that?
My question to Republicans is this: are you so misinformed that you don't know your candidate is losing his mind or are you so stupid that you don't think it matters?
The poll asking Americans about how they feel about the future is not just about how the government is involved in our lives. There can be several other factors that impact that feeling. Let’s try to not be biased when using data.
Heels Up Harris loves to talk in circles so she doesn't have to answer the question.
Does she really think we don't remember what she has done to this country for the last 4 years
How you ask someone a question and interrupts them while they are answering? Its like he doesn't want the truth
Don't let her run on with a campaign add. Brett needs to shut her down and tell her he is going to interrupt her if she doesn't first answer the question.
dang, she really cant answer questions lol she shows she is NOT a leader. well peeps, especially supporters of hers, the IRS and the cheneys support her!
The question was simple give a number A: let me tell you.. that’s not the point blah blah blah  Murders, rapers drug dealers remember when Trump told that and everybody laughed like … they eating cats and dogs  WHATCH IT. Now !!!
If you know theres a major problem at the border and knew it when Trump was in office WHY DID YOU REMOVE 90 EXECUTIVE ORDERS OPENING THE BORDER UP?
Wasn’t this supposed to be an hour long? Looked like Brett was being yelled at to stop the interview at the end 😂
One thing for her not to answer any straight forward question ⁉️ We are all more than used to it with Kamala. BUT to not even have enough respect to apologize to the parents for something she knows deep down she caused and could have been prevented is appalling.
Question so if Biden is ok why did they replace him with you??
What did Pence do???????
20:51 this line of questioning is a work of art by our boy Bret
Shes short circuiting.. with these tough question
He pushed back but how is it that we all know the issues and Kamala's lies and Trumps policies better than the reporters. Kamala still got away with a bunch of lies.
Did he freshly stretch that flesh over his skull before this interview?
She cannot answer any question at all
She did great! His questions were ridiculous.
What?????? A reporter asking real questions!?!?!?!
She didn't answer even one of his questions..as usual, she’s just a word salad without saying anything! A waste of time!
I think the biggest question ‘facing’ Brett is how more Botox he can squeeze into that shining forehead 😂😂
What is the"plan"? Ask Brett, but you won't
Trump is unstable but Biden was brilliant making decision after decision……. Whaaaat??? LOL
Wow ! How not to answer any question….
Just answer the question it was your voice on the ads it’s politics Kammy.You’re a fraud,I see the earrings & small business are owned by immigrants
Let me finish not answering the question. 😂😂😂
Right away first question no answer
Those who support Trump are either part of his MAGA cult or are pretending that they prefer his economic policies. He hasn’t articulated clearly any economic policies so is it really his cruelty and racism that some are supporting him for?
Does she think shes good at this? She acts like a criminal
What is wrong with this man's actual face? Why is no one talking about how this man doesn't have a human face?
The questions asked here were from people on Twitter/X and Instagram.  2 days ago... Bret asked people to send him questions to ask Kamala. Fox gave people a voice in this interview.  Kudos to Bret.
Harris is the queen of avoiding answering questions- she’s so full of €#%£¥
What a disgrace didn’t answer single question
Where's the lie?
This woman answers more questions than Donald Trump in his stupid town hall, and Trump doesn't sit for a serious conversation.
This dude put on a clinic. He’d start the questions making her feel good then she’d start yapping just for him to snap it off to go against her.
can Brett not sit up straight?
She answers nothing actually...
Is she kinda slow?
Finally, some real hardball questions for this goofball, it's good to see the liar squirm. Just fast forward thru her BS answers, it's not worth listening to.
20:30 should US president be able to handle criticism without getting visibly angry?
It's a yes or no question. All we get is, I'll follow the law...
I wonder if Trump has the guts to do an  interview on MSNBC? 😂😂😂 😅
She grew up in middle class. Dont ask these questions to her.
If Joe Biden was so good, why did the top democrat leadership force him to step down from running?
She has the earnings helping her answer questions. Lol!
Concepts of a plan are better than an actual plan right?
Why didn't she do all these things 3 years ago?
She is.... eish I don't know
Now when is Donald Trump's interview with Anderson Cooper???
Has she ever answered a single question?
My question is, who's running for president against Trump? Why keep bringing Biden back in since he's not running?  What is the purpose of asking her about him when in less than a month we will have a new president?
Does anyone know what she stands for now? The only thing I know is that she blames everything on President Trump. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Why do we need to go to a website when this women who sleeps with married men can not tell Americans what she stands for without blaming a person who hasn't been president in 4 years while she has been the vice president for 4 years. Open your eyes.
She is an amazing person can do an interview and never answer a question Is it she doesn't know the answer or she can't understand the question 😮 Great future President 😂😂
How are those Bluetooth earrings working for you Camela?
Not one question answered.
Is she on bluetooth?
@17:25 what is going on here?
Real Journalism!!! Thank you for asking questions that needed to be asked!
Answer the question!!!
What’s the number?     Harris: let’s get to the point and ignore the question
Man! How many Valium pills did she swallow before this interview? What happened to her usual pot smoking cackling giggles?
How can you vote for Trump when his own Vice President pick hates his guts? If your own VP hates you, why should I even vote for you?
During last decade, Trump was in office for only 4 yrs??
Is she wearing those earrings again ?
How is it that a man not in office has more power than the sitting President and Vice President?   Each time the Biden administration blames Trump for affecting policy while they are in office just speaks to their ineptitude.
She grilled Trump
A Democracy or a REPUBLIC?!? Wonder if the  VP should know that?
She's wearing those earbud pearl ear piece again   Why is this not identified
4 minutes and 17 seconds to not remotely answer the very first question, but rather intentionally run from it. 🤦🏼‍♂️
So because you didn’t get your bill passed you just made the problems worse?
Why she so angry?
Why is she stalling so much and not answer the questions?
Can you see the strings?
Yooooo aren't those the SAME earrings she wore during the debate? The ones from debate looked like audio earring and they look the same!!
That was cringe worthy.  You ask her a question she deflects to donald trump. She is a master deflector.
What will u turn the page from? 😂😂😂 Awesome!
What did she mean by what we would do as president of the united states? Shouldn't she have said what I would do as president of the US?
Is she reading straight from Karl Marx? Those quotes she's using...
Why is she  so  short in height
Fox news evidence regarding Iran and sactions for kamla is to show numbers of Iran oil revenue going up at the same time inflation also has occured? Lmfao Also correlation isn't causation.
OMG Kamala couldn't get Trump with the "excuse me im speaking" so she went on Fox and tried it and that was a disaster ^.. Answer the question! You can't say "i'm answering ghe question" when you're going off on a complete tangent Kamala
Why did he keep cutting her off and interrupting her ....he refused to let her give a truthful answer because he saw where she was herding him lol she mopped the whole floor with him😂🎉😂😅
LMAO this was more of an interrogation than an interview. She tried to answer and he moves on cause he doesn't want to hear what needs to be heard.
She hijacks the 🎉question,  won't answer the question, and hijacks the whole interview with a word salad.
When is Trump's interview on MSNBC?
In the past decade democrats have been in charge more than Donald Trump.  Is this lady serious?  Turn the page from the nonsense her own people have done.  Right.
Seriously does not answer one question.
Is she wearing her special earrings again
She speaks in questions: "Working. .  with the heads of our military?. . . to support Israel in its requirement to defend itself?. . . including Iran's proxies in the region? . . . and my commitment to that is unyielding?" (I recognize the behavior because it's something we used to do when I was in college, back in the 60's. It's a sort of "Valley Girl" speak.)
He should of had a mute button so she would just stop talking. Just answer a stinking question FOR ONCE AND NOT BLAME TRUMP i feel dumber after listening to this rambling mess 😵‍💫
Obama has been schooling this woman on how to dance around a question.
Ask her about Willie Brown! And her car and several hundred thousands of dollars in salary over those who were in that job years before her. Ask her if Willie Brown’s wife will be voting for her? 😂
Where has this Kamala Harris been when it came to campaign. 🙏🏻🇺🇸
Count how many times she overtalked Bret or told him to let her speak. TRUMP 2024
Keep going, Brett. You really got hold her feet up to a fire talk when you're asking her about immigration, and then tickle them a little bit.
18:05 why cant she answer a question 🤣
Brett sucks.  If you ask a question, allow an answer.  He wanted gotcha moments and half answers.  Constantly interrupting.  Brett andTrump are unfit.
You could give her the questions with multiple choice answers, and she still wouldn't answer a question.
OMG!!  Why can’t she answer to the question😂😂
She will not answer the question, nor will she accept any responsibility for the tragedy.
Just answer one single question straight up for gods sake.
She’s never clear
Can she say a sentence without saying Trumps name? 😂
Did or did not the secretary of defense under this administration just authorize the military to use deadly force against the american people he's the one that had to approve this directive
If harris wins who will she blame for America's problems? That should be a very real question.
She literally does not answer questions. Props to Brett for recognizing her stalling and bringing her back to the question. TRUMP 2024🇺🇸
Why was she turn away like she was listening ?
Idiot. She can’t answer any question.
Is she serious, the Biden-Harris admin threatened federal workers their jobs for not taking the Covid vaccine. Some did loose there jobs. They told social media platforms to sensor facts on the effectiveness of the vaccine in which most were true.
what a waste of time.   can she actually explain a policy instead of just bashing Trump?
Is this the whole interview?? I can’t find anything longer anywhere else lol if she can’t do this for longer than 30 mins, NO WAY she’s doing Joe Rogan.
Please just answer the question Skamala????
So if this is a democracy then why did the democrats shove Joe Biden out and replaced him with Kamala Harris whom the American people of the Democratic Party didn’t nominate????
I’m surprised Brett actually asked her real questions!!!😮
WHAT was that?? 2 people having a conversation about 2 different topics at the same time. Yikes! She has a lot of substanceless sentences in her repertoire!
Is she sorry for people suffering and lost their love ones because  of open border? I don’t think so because birds is still open
What is wrong with her. 😮
Can’t she just shut up and listen to a question?
I've never thought that 80-pages worth of policies would be considered comprehensive. Also, why is it that her declarative sentences sound like questions? Listening to her for so long made my head hurt.
If they need more resources at the boarder, then why did Kamala and Biden make boarder patrols jobs harder?
“when were you aware of Joe Biden’s diminished faculties?” To point out how could she diagnose DJT as unstable if she couldn’t recognize Biden’s failed mental capacity. Great question that went right over her head!
Anyone know which CARTEL she went against? And if TRUMP spent $20 mil who gave her the bill or are hers 1/2 price?
She can’t answer tougher questions
Why is a bill necessary to send security to the border?
I am not a Harris fan but it’s so rude how this guy asks her a question then talks over her when she tries to answer.
How many was the question
what the hell is this. Is she restarted ?
Question is why didn’t you close the border and then work on immigration reform
1st question she just lied, lied, lied, lied.... They put up a big sign that said come on in and we will give you financial aid to survive.
Why doesn't she just answer the question.? Exactly what a Liar does- avoids the truth with a bunch of ignorant words. She's a puppet and everyone can see it  At least with Trump we know when he stands and bravely speak just what he means  IM FOR TRUMP AND JD. May GOD Bless Both of Them!!!
Why does she wear the same earrings for interviews/debates?
Who wrote those policies when you cannot put two and two together!
Don't ask me about my policies...go to my website.....lol
How long before Brett regains his IQ After this?
Why was illegal immigration lower under the prior administration? What changed between administrations? Is growing government the only answer to the crisis  that was manufactured by changes made in border policy?
Where's the southern accent?
Be able to handle....say...an interview??
What is interviews happen after they start voting and it's like seriously
Brett, best interview questions …you held her feet to the fire. She has the gift of speaking really slow to buy time and try to avoid truthfully answering. Buffering is what she is good at ONLY!  She never will own her failures at the border.
Wow when he was asking a question and she proceeded to blame it on trump before he even finished the question and then proceeded to talk over him
Wasn't the border bill she claimed that she wanted to pass and that trump somehow blocked not being in any current political seat, was also about sending the majority of the money within that border bill was actually about sending more money to wars overseas and not even our own needs?
Lots of words. Lots! If you string them together in the right order they form a meaningful sentence. Lots of questions......no answers.
My questin would be to VP Haris would be why are you such garbage?
Who’s paying for her free free policies
Bret kept stoking her to get her angry to make her look angry..Well he succeeded there. His questions are lame.
how can a rational-competent person who understands the language attentively watch this and vote for her? how?
This guys tried really hard to stop her answering the question. He talked more than her.. she is tough.    Kamala is qualified
This is soooo funny she has NO ANSWERS when he ask about the voters habababa
Proposing legislation isn't passing legislation.
Second question, again cut off. Two minutes in and she's been cut off twice as if she's been rambling nonsense like someone for 10 minutes.
As a woman, I saw a woman who would not answer the questions asked to her.  All she could do is complain about Trump.  But she would not answer a full question. So many non-answers.  This interview did not sway conservative women to her side. If anything, it pushed people away from her.    These were not “got ya” questions…. these were reasonable questions but she’s not use to being asked actual tough questions.
This was like a married couple in the middle of a divorce arguing about who is at fault
Let her answer the question!
lead a country? this lady can't even lead a pencil
Ask her how much money she spent trying to erase her photos and all the information about her relationship with P Diddy
To every conservative on here acting like the first question asked by Bret Baier was an actually honest question. Imagine Trump going to an interview on CNN, MSNBC, or any other network and the first question asked by the interviewer is "So when you were President 2020, how many American Citizens did you let die from COVID?". That's the type of questions Bret Baier is using. It's not honest, earnest questions. It's talking points disguised as questions. The very definition of gotcha journalism.
Still can’t answer a question what a moron . How many dummy
Can someone please ask her what exactly are her policies
Constantly - it’s all about Trump - she just will not answer the questions with any form of truth - parhetic
Every single question she pivoted to Trump.  Every.  Single.  Question.   She has no plan, other than Orange Man Bad.
Same earrings as the debate.
She never answers questions!!!   Smh
Did she even pass the bar?
She isnt answering questions put to her...just spieling and demanding control.  Not answering the question
how does she know his ad cost $20 million dollars?
Ask why she called young people stupid!!!
Can Trump go to CNN next? She’s stood in front of Faux News and she did well, when is Trump going to a left leaning channel to do an interview? Not even 60 minutes?
Can we go to her website and ask for a refund from ukraine. I didnt agree to that
Are those the same ear rings she had on for the debate?
FOX News and Brett did what no other outlet could, he asked her real questions and demanded answers.
less of an interview and more of an interrogation. this is the best that fox has now...sad.
If Harris gets this rattled by asking simple questions rom Brett Baier....what would she do with Putin debating her or china or rocket man or Iran
Leave Trump out ! Answer the questions!
Capability to directly answer a question….. FAILED!!!!  She is incompetent!!  She’s obsessed with President Trump! 😂 She can’t speak a sentence without his name.
Wow a whole 26 min and she got knocked out with every question
She can’t answer the question
Handle criticism…!?🤔 20m in you’re gettin pretty worked up being challenged to justify an abysmal DIE Vice Presidency! 😂
She can't answer ONE f***ing question!!
She gets an Academy award for never actually answering a question and then saying quit interrupting I’m trying to answer a question which is actually a one-word answer.  Classic narcissistic technique, deny and deflect
She's wearing the earrings that work as an ear piece again. Am I the only one to notice this ? She wore the same earrings during the Trump debate. Theree is a company that makes these. I cant remember the name of the company though.
It’s annoying he ask a question and then interrupts her. What is the point of an interview if you don’t let the person being interviewed answer.
My question is why do republicans not want a bill but instead want 90 executive orders for one issue.... why does half the country support him?? BECASUSE THEYRE JUST LIKE HIM.
Her vibe was desperate….over talking, disrespectful, a lot of deflection…the question regarding Biden decline, is a slap in the face to the American people who watched him decline, the American people are smarter than her.
Does anyone else find her totally nauseating or is it just me?
Why didn’t we have this problem to this degree before her admin took office?
Your problem is you talk for 10 minutes before you even start to try to answer the question and we aint got time for that. You say let's get straight to the point and then start talking about something completely different. That's like hearing a person say "to make a long story short." You know that m***********'s gonna talk for an hour.
Can she just answer a question? Shes a dancer, dances around every question!
Same earrings as debate
Does she know that Iran already has nucas?
Answer the questions,  Kamala.
Good for Brett Baier for actually asking pointed questions and not letting Harris weasel out of the interview.
Zhe is the biggest lairer  an disgusting  an cant answer  one question 😤  what a dumb person 😒
Giving a video clip gave a handful of time for her to prepare for the question.. stupid interviewer.
Trump2024 she can't even answer a single question
18:15 Was that a smoke detector beep...
He doesn't let her answer the first question, immediately cuts her off when he doesn't get the answer he wants. 😂
This gal, is a complete fool! Can’t be honest, can’t be asked a meaningful question, can’t answer with the truth! A BIMBO AT BEST!
Biden was an experiment 😱
Answer the question Kamala
Didn't Kamala keep inmates incarcerated longer than sentenced for labour. Sounds like slavery
She was just to ready to argue instead of having a discussion with Q&A’s
she is so full of her own delusions! Answer a straight question instead of tripping over your word salads
How the hell was Trump involved with that border security bill when he wasn’t a politician?
Joe Rogan tomorrow?
She always blames Trump every time she gets a hard question.
She's offering a plan?  What plan?
Do we want to talk about what a staff member has to say about you? I really don’t think you want to go down that road Madam Vice President.
Brett, your questioning technique is so biased. Fox News is not journalism.
Because her adds don’t spread fear. Kettle black?!?
She really isn't capable of answering a question, is she?
Have you forgotten how bad Trump was as president? For God sake he had 4 years to fix immigration, build a wall and release his tax return.
Tell me, why didn’t all the Dems like her when she was VP, but out of nowhere, they are so in love with her as presidential candidate.
ahmmmmm why is she getting riled up?????
She can’t answer one question asked. Instead wants to turn it into a lecture.
She still doesn't answer a single question! She just likes to talk louder like she's important!
She couldn't/wouldn't answer a single question.  Im not surprised at all. She's an absolute joke and a terrible candidate.
She doesn’t answer the question
Why do we need a new bill when you’re not enforcing current law?
Look at her earrings they are the same ones she had at the debate, the other interviews and this one too. I wonder??
What a joke this person is. Can't answer a straight question. Twists everything.
She got angry, yelled and threw a fit instead of crying. This was great?!!
Why you need more judges?? If you would just keep Trump policy.
Why, is Veep Harris campaigning for Donald Trump??? She seems to like Trump so much 😅😂.  All she can say is Trump Trump Trump!!!!❤😂. I have a feeling that she will vote for Trump😂
When was her border bill introduced  - 9 mos ago. She has been in office for 4 years.
This is an epic disaster of an interview. She cannot answer a single question.
Has Harris completely lost her mind? Can we see her cognitive test results?
Answer the question...
First 5 minutes.i only have a question.?! Who’s the vice president the last 4 years? She can make the change 3 years ago. She’s a Dumb candidate
You can sense how burdened she feels as each question is asked. Never seems comfortable - so defensive.
Can she answer any questions?? Deflecting, over and over again.
Why is she yelling at him?
Does Doug know about Montel ?
She could not answer in a straight forward manner a single question. She blamed TRUMP for everything... 😂
"Grilled"? You mean she was spoken over and treated with great disrespect! Great job Madam VP! 💙💙💙💙
What would she say if she was not allowed to say Donald Trump????
Does it look like she has Americans best interests in mind?
She still can’t answer a question without blaming Trump for all her short comings.
Who’s voting for Kamala?
Let get to the point ? Ok then answer the simple question
Was she hostile right off the bat? 😫
Why can almost no one in these comments spell BORDER? 🙄🙄🙄  Oh wait, I know. Haha idiots
Y cant she answer the questions??????????,
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE HER TO GO DOWN TO THE BORDER?
WHAT  A JOKE SHE IS CANT EVEN ANSWER QUESTION
just one time Kamala  could you answer the question asked?
Come on you know what im talking . No i dont lol
So we get a bipartisan border bill that Trump kills to play politics and it's not his fault? He says he wants to be a dictator, to use the military to snuff opposition, constantly lies about every single thing that comes out of his orange McDonald's grease mouth, and its not his fault?
Does she really think peope are dumb enough to fall for all these lies? Im independent and im voting for the only president to ever dontate his presidential salary donald j trump
Can someone see if yhose earrings have a vibration which is transmitting a voice?
I wonder how any thinking American would vote for this candidate??
She evades all questions that expose her
For the hundreth time, she did not answer the question
Same earrings?
She’s wearing the same earrings from the debate, bug in her ear?
Why is gods name is she screaming at Brett??
how much she hiding in her nose
Does she think she can lead by bulldozing and not listening to anybody? Still no answers.
Thank you Fox for asking the real questions 👍
How can Harris focusing on fixing immigration when she OPENED the border
Why would the Republicans not support any bipartisan immigration bill? Put country over party.
But she never answers the question yes just talks in circles.
Is it just me or she’s in love with Trump ,this for me is obsessive infatuation.She can’t stop thinking or talking about him ,I believe she’d be quiet if she doesn’t talk about him
Uh, excuse me, but putting a five point bullet plan and place for Black people only and he’s dividing the country? Just because you’re losing in the polls, you try to appeal to the black voters!
Why won’t she talk longer than 25 min?
She TRUMPED the rude trump dummy and handled this interrogation skillfully!!!! HARRIS/WALZ 2024!!!!!!
Deflect much?! What a 🤡
For real?
Its all Trumps fault, never answers the question.
in the last 16 years democrats were in power 12 years. So if they have all these amazing plans why didn’t they fix anything??
Typical responses from a democrat, avoid answering the question and just blame Trump for their failures, Kamala sucks!
How many times did she call him a fascist? How many times did they beat him down? The enemy within is people like her and Pelosi
He asked you for a number answer the question please
Bro this is so funny   She can’t handle no questions 😂
how much she hiding in her nose
Long-winded responses laced with lies & no answers. Brett asked the right questions, but she has failed to take responsibility for the failures of her administration.
Why are you letting her go on and on and on ?
WOW...! She won't answer the question ⁉️😢
Brett when you ask a question you should actually let the person answer
Name one virtue Donald Trump has .
So if I can't do my job can I tell my boss it was a person in our office over 4 years ago fault??
She's really good at manipulating the question and turning the topic to blaming Trump!
Why hasn’t she fixed the problem in the last 3 1/2 - 4 years!!!
OMG cringe she is falling apart on simple questions.
Why does she talk like that, it’s like she says a few words and ends in a higher note then pauses then starts again the pauses then starts again likes she’s repeating something. I know I’m not trippin when we’d  say the pledge of allegiance in school as kids this is exactly how we’d sound
Last time she got grilled like this she dropped out of the race.
Did she convert any Trump supporters?
How can anyone watch her interviews and still vote for her?????
Brett thank u for the real questions and shutting down the word salad answers
He should have asked her why she provide benefit la and aid to illegal immigrants
Who’s paying for all this? I bet it’s us the American citizens who pay taxes.
Is it just me, or does it sound like she is being fed what to say in her earring? Especially wqhen she t a lks about Iran being the biggest threat
For the first time ever she was asked hard questions and pushed for answers. Thank you Brett!
She does not have a policy, how she is going to rule the country? How?😂
How about not letting a huge number of illegal immigrants in without knowing who they are?
Isn't she wearing the same earrings that she wore during the debate and are suspected to be an audio feed from someone feeding her answers??
Why can't she directly ANSWER any question... it's all garbage that comes out of her mouth... there is NOTHING coherent..
@18:22 was that a smoke detector beep? 🤣
How would she know about what the American people want?
The last decade? Are you serious? Four years of the Biden-Harris administration, four years of the Trump-Pence administration and two years of the Obama-Biden administration. Do you even math Madam Vice President? Sixty percent of the last decade has been Democratic administrations.
Very sadly the number of questions she would not answer.
She can’t answer a single question! What a disgrace to America!
I just wonder how Brett kept a straight face during her lies and run-on sentences
I can’t believe when Bret asked her what her policies were and she had the nerve to refer the American people to her website. I’m guessing because she doesn’t know what they are!
Answer the fookin question
Nobody notices all these cuts?
is that straight vodka she's necking?
She's great at trying to run out the clock. Just hoping to get fewer questions, and trying to figure out what to say that won't answer any of them.
I've yet to hear this woman give a straight answer to a question.
who did Trump lock up?
How can anybody really thinking about voting for her?
Why does she keep saying "When we are president" ? Who is we?
She could not give a straight answer. Not one!
Does he ever let her finish a question?
Ask people of California just what she did.
Projection and deflection. They accuse the opponent of the exact same thing they’re plotting or acting on. She took a page from Pelosi’s book. Trump was already president and didn’t do any of the things they accuse him of. The questions isn’t “do they think we’re stupid?”, it’s “how stupid do they think we are?” If anyone is unstable, she’s proving it’s her.
7:00 Did nobody else notice that she was having trouble holding in her smile?! That’s sickening and disrespectful to the families of those involved! 😡
She's good at not answering questions She gets pissed when held accountable
glad it wasnt titled "interview"
Is this the "gaslight girlboss" Gen Z is always on about??
How did that stopped bill hours after taking office help the American people…???
Why didn't Trump sign the immigration bill into law when he had the opportunity to do it? Why?
What happened with 3.5 years?
Thank god someone asked some real questions good job brother
Does she not hear what she’s saying?
Where were you Kamala when they first started calling out for you to go to the border? You took your piddly old time getting there when help was needed!!! Lies, Lies, Lies!
This is one deceitful evil human being. Can’t answer a question and thinks she can just smile like a donut and climb the ladder.
Why is she talking louder now? 13:15  😂😂😂
Not one question really answered
Can you trust her???
I wonder what she thinks of Donald Trump?
First time someone ask questions that matters and still no answer
She’s got the earrings on so why is she still doing a horrible job.
If she has such a great plan to fix the economy, then why was the economy trash the last four years while she was in office?
She sucks so bad. So full of crap. She will never just answer a question.
She never answered the question, and wounder why nobody will vote for her .  What a dumbass
What meds is she on? She is so disrespectful smh.
Does she not own any other pair of earrings?!!!
I don't know if she does this on purpose or if she's this stupid
That sorry excuse of a woman can't answer a single question 😂.and then can't say a sentence without saying Trump 😂😂
Need more judges ..maybe prevent people from Entering here will save us the need for more judges ?
Brett doesnt allow the Vice President to speak???
Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. Cant she just answer an freakin question ? She's incompetent
Poor Kamala; she looks like she's about to cry... she's not used to real questions. Is this who we are electing as President of the United States - the most Powerful Country on planet earth?
Which question did she answer…
This woman should be great in playing dodge ball. Never answers a question with a yes or no.
How rude is this guy, let her answer the question..
She dodged nearly every question.
Who created the broken immigration system?
She was just down to the border????? 😂😂😂😂😂😂Lol
Why didn’t you shut the border down instead of letting them flood in you did that take responsibility!
She can’t answer ONE question literally NOT ONE it’s so irritating to listen to her lie
When does she talk about her middle class upbringing?
DID SHE REALLY DO HER BEST WORK UNDER WILLIE BROWN? IS THAT TRUE?
Just answer the questions!
Why hasn't she implemented her plan.
She deflected the question  Refused to answer the question  Call him names   And still did not answer the question
It was either April or October??
First he asked for a number then he goes to policy?? Whats going on
Wow she can answer policy questions... Unlike the orange one who talks about windmills, eating dogs and some other jargon mixed with fear-mongering
Can she answer a simple question
Sooo does she wear the same earrings every interview now?? LOL
Never gave one specific answer.      "I will follow the law" is not a statement of a person's policy.     Nothing here but smoke.
She won’t answer the question, and filibusters and makes speeches. Hello that’s why we don’t like you.
Why do our fake gop polls show trump winning?
I want her to answer why the undone what was actually working!!!!!!!
Why are her interviews so short? It’s like she can’t talk for more than 20 minutes
How many times did she say Donald Trump?
Are you an Independent?  REALLY an Independent?    Then vote for POLICY, not party!  Whose policy gave us low inflation, affordable energy, affordable goods, affordable housing, safer streets, and no wars?  Don't vote for either party; they're both piles of crap attacking each other.   Vote for the candidate that makes America stronger and a better place to live in.
How about human trafficking for political gain?
She was trying to just spout her nonsense word salad and He kept following up with good questions. Finished is a word that she will have to get use to in November.
So why did biden sell the material for the wall?
What does that even mean?  Thats all i can say
Does Kamala own any other earrings besides the Blue Tooth pearl ones she’s worn for every interview?
She can never just answer the questions🤦‍♂️
Ask "gotcha" question. Talk over the answer when you realize it's not the gotcha you think it is. Rinse, repeat.
Brett being praised for asking basic questions.     We are living in some crazy times.   Amazing
The look on the journalist’s face when none of his “gotcha” questions sticks is priceless
WTH is she talking about
Please answer the question.   Provide details on what specifically she will do  A bit more about you and the less about trump.
not impressed with the question set.  not that they were bad, they were good in a basic way.  but the "turn the page" thing is confrontationally unecessary, the wrong track thing is not.  The Biden fit thing was good, as it shows a ridiculous answer.  Iran?  yeah that looks stupid or misinformed or nonconfrontational to the real threats.  Certainly makes Putin smile or smile at the political game answer.  It's funny that 60M made here look bla, and FOX evoked some "strong talk" from her, but for me a decided voter, she didn't make a case.  But I am also informed so she couldn't really  😉
She doesn’t answer the question
She can’t answer a question straightforward.   Goes back to Trump, he’s asked you a question, not what you think about Trump.
Ive never seen anyone wear the same earrings for 2 months, is that normal ?
Finally! The questions we’ve been waiting for!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 thank you!! 👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤
Finally a non-softball interview.
Does she really think we're this stupid to believe she's actually answering a question?
Why would anyone in their right mind vote for this person?
Does she realize how fking stupid she is
When he asked her how she is different and she went all over the place 😂 what are you turning the page from? Lol she couldn't even answer that!
So WHAT is the PLAN
She hasn't answered one question ⁉️
$25,000 for new homes.. who's money is that..
Great questions from Bret I wish she would have answered them. Why is she so angry?
Anyone who votes for this idiotic woman who never answered a single question - needs to have their head examined
She’s killing her whole campaign with these questions 😂😂😂 I love it 😂😂😂
How is she running for President? Real question
Trumps unstable? What do you call someone who panders to the audience changing their accent ?
This communist didn’t answer a single question without deflecting.
She missed her calling she should have been a dancer, the way she dances around questions is impressive.
So when is Trump going on MSNBC or CNN? We all know he is too much of a coward to face ANY real journalist.
Answer the freaking questions
She can't even answer simple questions that Trump would have quick answers to!! We can't afford a moron who's down with the syndrome like she's had a lobotomy!!😳
Good interview !  no cake walk for her on questions .
Can any person talk so much and never really say anything!
...not one question answered. smh...
Can she just answer 1 question without including “Donald Trump”?
Is she wearing her microphone earrings again? Even if she did SHE STILL WOULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS!
This is a Question nobody has asked HARRIS - - -WHAT IS HE FOREIGN POLICY: IN REGARDS TO ISRAEL, TAIWAN VS CHINA, AND UKRAINE VS RUSSIA? If supporting Ukraine when do we stop giving money away?
Wow! Did she say anything???
Dickhead report wouldn’t let Harris answer the question. Bloody idiot.
❤Why does Kamala blame Trump for issues she created?
She avoided answering any questions like a slippery heel.
Great questions FINALLY, however she continues to just repeat rhetoric and the same crap she parrots in every speech. She's an empty shell, like Biden but not even as good of a politician
Why does she have such fancy belts etc but the same pair of pearl earrings every time
Kamla knows how to not answer questions
How is she blaming someone who isn’t even in a position to stop you?
She is mentally challanged
Republican's supporting Her?😅 Really?
She has the same earrings? Electronic support?
Answer the questionnnnmmmm
She’s cooked! Finally an actual interview that is getting her to answer questions. She’s great at word salad and not answering questions 😂
I've never seen so many non-answers before this presidential election.  The uniparty is a farse.
Her tactic is talking in circles, which takes up time, and still does not answer pressing questions.
Doesn’t answering the question, still blaming Trump
Don’t ask a question if you don’t intend to listen to the answer. Was this guy raised by wolves? My Mom would have backhanded me across the room for interrupting someone like that.
Same Earings?
Why is that coward trump not wanting a debate?
When will she answer a question?
Release the unedited interview Brett. What are you and fox news afraid of?
Why does it looks like that Kamala has more English vocabulary than Trump ? 😂🤣
What the hell was that ? Seriously.    She dodged and weaved like the next DUI arrest.
She should have stopped answering after the 4th question and then get the YMCA dance party started for the last 30 mins.
What about my small business I already have?  You going to give my money?
She got mad because he would not let her just go on and on about nothing so she could avoid more questions being asked.
What in the world???😮
he is asking a question, her answer turns in to what trump said and did !!! YOU tell us what will YOU do madam CONFUSE!!!
Still  not answering  the ??s
Can this idiot actually let her speak and stop interrupting her every two seconds? He's making a fool of himself.
Interviewers job… To ask questions. Interviewees job to answer them. Only one of these things happened
Did Kamala ever bring these great ideas to Joe?
He should have asked her to take off her earrings
Why is she, overtalking the speaker? Very un-professional ( Woman )
Why is it when I google kamala I get pictures of hairy toes of camels, but never anything of substance or value. Isnt she like the mistress of a big company exec or something?
Wasn’t she in charge of the boarder
Can this lady answer any questions?
Your focus is fixing a problem that you made...?
How hard is it to answer yes or no question?
Please answer just one question. Quit blaming someone who hasn’t been in office for 4 years. She has been in power the last 4 years.
What are you turning the page from ? lol you are the one in there !  You make no sense ! Projecting !  Blaming !
Aren’t you going to fact check?
She’s not even answering the questions five minutes and she’s talking around the questions. This is hers and Biden’s fault for the border and she can’t even take accountability
What? Is - exactly? “KAMALA’s- quote” professional and - life experiences”?  Cause so far- 4 years? As VP? I haven’t seen! Any of her - quote- professional experiences or life experiences! Impact anything GOOD - for 🇺🇸USA🇺🇸 Just another “Kamala word salad”!
What is 2+2? A. 4  B. 3 Kamala: well let’s cut to the chase if you really break it down it’s clear that it’s time to turn the page.
What has she done in 4 years 😂😂😂😂😂
She got pissed yelling, gritting her teeth, and people thought she could be president she cant answer one question that made sense.
Go around the question, go over the question, go under the question.  Never ,never answer the question.
Answer the questions!
How could anybody vote for this person.
What ARE her plans?? Anybody??
Can’t answer a simple question but wants to run our country…. Keep talking Kamala, your ignorance shows
We are exhausted on how she never can answer a question
Just like many women, they drown out the person asking questions, ramble on non-sensibly  and never answer clearly, the question asked😡.
DOES LISTENING TO HER GIVE ANYONE ELSE A HEADACHE?
Can't answer the questions.  All lies
She keeps side stepping the questions,interrupting has absolutely done nothing in 3 1/2 years she wont take responsability for her actions
Apply for driver's license??? We don't apply in my state, we get tested
Why bring in the threats to begin with? Cough cough...
She answered nothing!
Interviewers must not stomp on the words while the question is being answered. That rude and antagonistic not even under the field of journalism.
What is she talking about?? I give Brett kudos, no way I could sit there listening to her incoherent ramblings.
I like Fox good to know this network isn't woke lol not letting Kamala get away with her BS practiced lines that steer away from the question
Answer the questions
Can Donald Trump handle a tough interview like this one? Trump shits himself even when fox is sending him soft balls. Lol
Did she criticize the last decade? If so doesn't that include former President Obama?
he asks but doesn't let her finish speaking ....  what a poor interviewer ....
She never answered a question with a real answer. All deflection. Well done Bret!  He refused to let up.
I definitely agree Harris wanted to filibuster every straight forward question ask of her.
How must cash did this administration give to Iran ?
Did she answer even one question?
This is a joke right!…it was a “yes” or “no” question. Let’s all be honest. Where were you for the last three years on the boarder polices??…STOP blaming everyone else! Yes, everyone wants support; so where were you??
Why wasn’t all of this worked on for the last three years then? If that is as simple as it gets then why wasn’t it implemented?
This looks like she got told to stop drinking and is 2-3 days in 😂 irritable much? 😅
God can these questions can be anymore bloated? What braindead macaque thinks "ERM... WHY DO 50% OF THE COUNTRY LIKE TRUMP?" is a good question? ☠☠☠
Ask the questions?
She was a sloth when she answered questions. Reminded me of the DMV scene in Zootopia. For someone that wants to do away with the filibuster, she certainly did take a long time talking and saying nothing at the same time.
It's hard to answer questions when the interviewer constantly interrupts when he doesn't like what you're saying.
We are tired of her talking around questions, so thank you Brett!
Why did Fox invite her on if they won't allow her to answer?  Great Job, Kamala!! You're going to be a fantastic President 💙
She should be more direct when answering these questions.
How's Trump loosing after this mess?!?!?
A lying idiot. Can’t answer a straight question. God help us!
Notice how the pitch of her voice gets higher after every question
If elections mattered, would the people in power actually let us decide??? We know their viewpoints on populism.
Why does she always sound like a librarian reading a book to second graders?  No offense to librarians.
She’s So Stupid she can’t answer a simple question, How, ManyIllegals have been admitted in to  the country in the last3 1/2 years , 1, 2 , 3, ?  She can’t Imagine? Anything !
She honestly can't even answer one simple question.
She responds to question by reverting back to Trump. She does not spell her policy by what she can do and did during the BIDEN/Harris administration but by what she can promise in a generic and rhetorical sense.
is this the full interview?
She still hasn't answered questions with any insight
Did this idiot answer one question? What a failure of a human.
Which socialist policies do you like the most?
Just answer the dang question
She has not answered any the questions
How does this not end her campaign?
Can u apologise for them girls deaths “yeh Im apologetic for them it shouldn’t of happened “ YOU LET IT HAPPEN AND U CALL THAT A APOLOGY🙈🙈🙈
Too bad it wasn't an hour that she promised. Who's the scared one?🇺🇸❤️🗳❤️🗳❤️🇺🇸
Can she answer 1 question without circling back to Trump?  She is pathetic!
Was he a threat during his 4 years?
She was asked about the millions of wet backs that she invited in and doesn't answer his question. He tried to get her to answer and wouldn't.
Look how many times she blinks while he's pressing her on the immigration numbers.
She evaded every question
How much time did she call trump name in this interview…. Genuine question
Gives a website address when asked about her policies.
Is she on drugs? She talks like she just hit a bong trying to keep a simple thought in her head
Does she realize, when she trying to describe her administration?  It seems like shes just trying to describe what we think trump's administration will be and claim it.
And she is wearing the same earrings in every interview.  The ones that may have a mic in them.  What woman do you know who doesn't change her earrings when she changes outfits?
He doesn't give her a chance to answer the question
She can’t answer a question straight if her life depended on it.  Why is this person a presidential candidate?
Is there a video or audio file of Trump calling Service Members "suckers and losers"?  My research leads me to the same place, and that's that a number of people (no names) heard him say it once and it was printed in "The Atlantic"--a very left-leaning magazine.
Wow can't answer a question  its just Trumps fault..what's wrong with the usa
Answer the question! Oh sheesh, that border bill was crap and had money going into the two current wars also, why must they include funding for unrelated wars????
It takes her like 5 years to answer a question.  Get to the point.
She dances around the bush and do not answers the question because she doesn't know what she's doing
What is a "scorj" - does she mean scourge? Maybe she needs "scorj" to rhyme with "bor-der".  "Border, border, border, score-j"
I'm shocked she even went, I think she was banking on burning up answer time with word salad that never answers the questions
How many lies so far? About 20 in the last 20 minutes.
So if it was known that iran was a threat, why would you fund them in youre administration
He asked straight questions ad got nothing back, so sad she talks about taking accountability and can NOT do it on anything herself.  Will not support her
Why does she keep bringing Trump up?
He is rude, if you ask a question allow a n answer.   If you invite someone over just to hear yourself speak. Kiss off
Talk about a master class in never answering a freaking question.
Why did Fox News get slapped with over 3/4 of a billion dollar law suit and lose  ? Stop the lies and start telling the truth.
Where are the 320,000 missing immigrant children.
Brett is RUDE as hell! He never allows ANYONE to get a word in before he goes on with his alternative fact questions 🙄
Was she supporting Cheree Peoples when she had her arrested and jailed for her disabled daughter missing school?
So when is transgender procedures medically necessary?
What else was in that border bill. I'll let you do the research
So if she has all these policies (80 pages worth) why the hell doesnt she talk about those instead of Trump? Especially the repeatedly debunked lies about him? My guess is because she has read them. 😏
Is this edited like the 60 minute interview?
Wow! Can’t answer a single question without DJT! She has TDS really bad!!
Surely, even rusted on Democrats can see through this garbage???
Why haven't you fixed it then. It was fixed you undone it
Disappointed that Bret baier didn't control that better.  He let her ramble on not answering the question for far too long ... Way too nice.
Right from the start, she doesn't answer the question.
She is useless. She walks around the issue without touching a single word that would even begin to answer the question.
Her ability to indirectly answer each question is genuinely impressive
A for effort Fox News.  I was not swayed by Kamala’s responses.  Word salad to control the time and distract from the question but you kept bringing her back which made her angry. She can deflect over and over again which is a red flag for intelligent people.
Im half way through this clip and she still hasn't answered a single question
I don't think she can just simply answer a question😮
How did she ever pass the bar exam?
Never will answer a direct question, flip flop constantly
Why does she act like they didnt let all these people in?
Anyone notice she was wearing the same earrings from the debate?
Lack of accountability.  No ownership to failed policies.  No responses of substance.  Diverting or dodging every question.  Well done Brett
With 79% of the population thinking the country is on the wrong track, how can she be getting 45% or more in polls?
So, the peaceful protests during the 2020 Summer of Love?
Oh good grief!  This woman is just trying to fill up air time with continuous gibberish to avoid actually answering a question.  🙄
What a bumble brain. Never answered a single question.
Ask the question
How is it she always wears the same earrings?  What woman wears the same earrings for every interview?
So when do you think she regretted doing this interview? I say after about 15 seconds.
Ask the question but cannot let her answer
Geaux Teddy Baier!!! Congratulations on a job well done, actually asking real questions and trying to hold her to answering! So proud of you!🎉
The number of Mexicans coming to the US illegally has gone down. We now have a large number of South Americans, mostly Venezuelans coming here illegally, What are the policies in which the US was involved (or influenced) that impacted the political environment in South America? That is what I want to know.
Was she 5 years old, five years ago?  5 years ago, she was a US senator, with access to classified information, to make informed decisions for the American people.  Therefore was is her 5years ago excuse acceptable?
How much has she paid to take people across the state to her rallies… how much for paying influencers to speak highly of her…
Hasn't she been the Border Czar for 3.5 years????
Question number one: The illegal alien problem would NOT have been solved by your bill which provided YET ANOTHER path to citizenship (read: express ticket)! The reversal of Trump directives is the proximate cause of our current problem. No excuses no lies. You own this.
Boy can she filibuster a question without answering it. 🙄🫤
I wonder how much she is being paid to run for the top office of the land. Im sure she is promised an insanely large amount.
I don’t think she’s all there…???
She's not afraid of your questions
Just answer the question… Such a whinny kvnt I can’t even listen to her anymore
Talking loud when u get challenged, is that how u plan to deal with other world leaders?
Who has been in office, Kamala Harris or Donald Trump?
Wow! Great questioning!!! Wow🎉🎉🎉 great. Trump 2024
Can she ever answer a direct question?
The question at 20:46 was so well done 👏
She’s going around every question. I will NOT be voting for her.
By peaceful protest does she mean like they had in Kenosha?
Was she amphed up?
Are you not convinced yet that she is not right to lead us? What if your mom talked like that when you asked for dinner? Could you see through the nonsense then? Are you willingly blind?
Love this interviewer. He finally is asking the hard questions and doesn’t let her go
How come Kamala never answer the question instead talk over the questions. Was her intentional or was she ignored the questions and don’t want to answer?
Stop blaming Trump!   Just answer the question without bringing Trump into every conversation.
With her stuffed nose voice, she twists and turns out of every question, instead of saying, YES! It was stupid to release unvetted illegal immigrants into America.
Imagine being a parent & listening to your kid not give you a straight answer. Not answer the question that you are asking but instead talking for a long time about other things or SOMEONE ELSE? This would lead you to redirect & ask the question again right? Or at least ask yourself what their intentions are or if they have the capacity to understand your question. It is insane to me that just bc she is a woman or politician or democrat or xyz that we are not holding her to the same standard that we would hold our CHILDREN regardless of their age. Politics should be black & white, yes or no, not spewed words. Sometimes it takes a long answer to allow people to understand but every single time & then not answering the question that is being asked is a huge red flag.
Bret Baier, restoring American's faith in journalistic integrity, one pointed question at a time.
Why didn’t he ask about one of her plans?
Wait didn't Hillary say lock him up ??? So now he can't say it lmao
Also, Bret should have asked her how would she act and talk, if she was attacked every day for 9 years
I'm so confused...is Donald Trump the current president?
Was it Trumps rhetoric dividing Americans when those who wouldn’t take the jab were ostracized, fired, ridiculed, and demonized for making their own healthcare decisions. Or nah?
SWhe is absolutely incapable of giving a straight answer to a straight question. She cannot be trusted.
I wonder why fox didn't have Harris Faulkner do this interview???  It would seem that it would have been another way that komilla's campaign couldn't use the fact that Brett was a man and that he either was 'mansplaining' things or that he was going after her because 'she was a woman'.
Why did she agree to this interview? Very odd.
Answer the dam question u clown
This woman cannot answer a single question.
Wait....I thought it was the Democrats who are trying to lock people up (President Trump); it's not President Trump trying to lock people up even though many of them deserve to be locked up for their abuse of the powers of government.
Is this an interview or debate?
I wonder how much rent Trump pays to live in Harris's head?
Maybe Elon Musk is right we are in a simulation cuz this can't be real life🤡🌎
American people???? Are you AWAKE yet?
Can she even answer a question?
Interviewers--and debate moderators and congress people getting testimony--should lay ground rules that REQUIRE answering the question--starting with Yes or No if its that kind or question. This interview wastes everyone's time if the questions aren't addressed, and that's on the interviewer to establish adult civil discourse rules at the very outset of the inteview.
Ma'am why do you lie soo much? Why do you say you are Black African American when you NOT!!!
Can she answer a question without bringing up donald trump?
she literally cant engage with any of his questions. she always deflects or plays whataboutism. shes cooked.
is this satire???😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Peaceful protests? Like the BLM riots? Just checking Madam VP, since you fully supported those riots, err, um, peaceful protests, I mean…
Finally, a journalist asked questions
You could tell the interviewer was on the clock he tried to rush his questions and she skilfully tried to stall. 😂
Hmmm same earrings as the debate???
How did Kamala prosecute members of the Guadalajara Cartel when it was only active until 1989? She did not pass the bar exam (on her 2nd attempt) until 1990!!
How does fact check feel loll how does sound bits feel? How does push back feel? How does Follow up questions feel? How does news reporter that’s not from CNN asking questions feel? And she thought this was going to go well 😂😂😂  trump does this dance every day 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 turn the page girl! Let’s turn the page on your you!
How did she agree to have this interview????
Kamala where is your proof I can’t find Trump saying that
She won’t answer the question, and filibusters and makes speeches. Hello that’s why we don’t like you
Did i just witness another submarine implode???🤔
How can someone flap her pie hole for 20 minutes and say nothing. I take it back. She did tell about 47 lies.
Why is Bret allowing her to wear those speaker ear rings so face take them off and listen to her then
Where’s her accent
Fox news interviews are always here's this question, now we're going to talk over you while you answer it.
Why does Brett interrupt her so frequently? Does he want to hear the answers?
She sucks at answering questions😂 that was not good for her😂
See how she completely dodged question on what she and Biden did four years ago. Thank you gentlemen for pressing her hard.
Gettng even half an answer out of that completely inept woman is impossible.
She has no answers they must be panicking
How much can you deflect and dodge serious questions
Kamala cannot answer a direct question.  She is unstable.  She has brain fog.  She is deplorable.  She is simply not capable of leading our country.
In every interview she wears the same earrings and neckless. Is someone telling her the answers?
Never answered a question,deflects and repeats lies and TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! and...Trump!!!!!!!!!!!
Imagine asking a question and then talking over her the entire time. Shady Fox “news” bends over backwards to depend their wanna be dictator once again
Oh my heavens, she can't simply answer questions, wants to just bash Trump.    If she can't answer here, how can she sit down with world leader's & make sense?Scary thoughts!
this is not a conversation can she shut up while the other is talking????
“Do you want to apologize to those families?”  “Bret, I grew up next to neighbors who took pride in their lawns”.
Kamala cannot answer a direct question.  She is unstable.  She has brain fog.  She is deplorable.  She is simply not capable of leading our country.
You should have asked her to pull her hair back to see if she had a ear piece
The question about Biden’s mental ability is a question about her honesty and trust worthiness. He refused to answer it. That tells you all you need to know.
Why didn't Brett bring up the disgraceful withdrawal of Afghanistan?
Toilet clogged???... Blame Trump!
What exactly has she done ?!?! She is totally clueless.😡
What's the plan????????
Grilled??? More like  pounded flat and fried to a crisp.
First real interview she has been too and can’t even answer one question with a direct answer!!!
He's the interviewer. He needs to take control away from her
Not a single question answered directly.
Interviewer: asks question Kamala: Donald Trump
Does fox news think the president is the king of everything? That seat is one branch of government, as it should be. I don't want any president to be a king of it all. That fight was won during the American Revolution.
a good interviewer would never interrupt constantly... good questions... bad manners... really...
Michael Bisping grilled her good.
did she ever answer the very first question?
Geeeeez .........what was THAT all about ......
She can't answer a question straight. She has to be one of the dumbest people I can think of with so much accomplished in her life. One must wonder how?
Is she wearing the special earrings? Hmmm
She never truely answers the question . She just dances around the questions 😳😳😳😳
How did She get the nomination?-if Biden had full faculties?
Officer Harris.  Could you name one person of all of these supposed criminal leaders that you prosecuted as A.G?  JUST ONE NAME.
Is this a Kamala roast? 😂 What an absolute tool! 😂
I'm not hearing her answer a single question. This is a masterclass in evasion.
Not a single question answered 😂
So what “we” would do as President of the United States? Who is “we”??
How is a candidate who ran for president who dropped out how could her be equal to a candidate who had a great record
She's criticizing Brett for the clip he just showed? 😂  First, it was accurate; it was shown live.
Why does he keep interrupting her, while she tries to answer.
I am so tired of her non-answers.
Why don’t they post the full interview? Because she did a good job and don’t want to highlight her strengths.
How much money has she spent on ads that should’ve been Biden’s
Is this the full interview?
Less than 30 minutes. Was she paid by hour like attorneys? How long does it take for her to shoot the fashion magazine?
Kamala, are you wearing your special earrings again?
How many people have resigned from working for Kamala?  Hmmm
does she only have one pair of earrings 🤫you'd think to quiet down the people saying those might be bluetooth headphones, shed wear a different set lol
Why is she getting so mad???? Like she’s got so pissed off after that live fact check😂 19:07
Starts of with this PO💩as always NOT answering the question. And to NOT APOLOGIZE to the families that lost their loved ones to this PO💩assholes that illegally entered our country. What A PO💩. Can’t let you finish if you’re NOT answering the QUESTIONS. GOOD WORK FOX
Did she give any yes or no responses???
I wonder why Mr. Trump is thought of by some as THE CHOSEN ONE? There is only one chosen one that I am familiar with and His name is Jesus Christ, of which Mr. Trump is total polar opposite. I'm glad that the good Lord knows all sees and hears all. May He bless all with peace and that people would try being more civil with each other.
And this is what happens when you don’t get the questions in advance.
LOL SHE STILL WILL NOT ANSWER ONE QUESTION.
First question wasn’t answered , and nothing was broken or needed to be fixed . They just messed up the system that was working . They could have e just signed an executive order. So she’s full of poop.
This b**** can't just answer a question without a word salad can she. Nails on a chalkboard listening to her
the most pathetic candidate that can´t answer one single question. Kamala gets a question and she thinks "HELL NO lets talk about what i learnt to say, because i know nothing at all and i am to stupid to have a normal talk"
Look at her getting pissed off already for simple questions. Everybody knows she has spoken about him so badly. They even try to assassinate him three times Kamala Harris shut up.
Finally some real questions for this clown
Everytime Donvict, an easily triggered, crybaby w/ a victimhood complex, had to answer a tough question, he attacked the reporter, called them "nasty," & walked away. VP Harris tolerated this hitpiece mess for 30 mins.
why  am I reading  the comment section and arguing  with ppl that worship Trump  and  defend him while  putting down  his opponent, not seeing the irony ?    This is Fox News channel!  Trump's supporter are already dead set  on voting for him  and villainizing his opponents.
I wonder if one of her life experiences, that she’ll bring is being one Montel’s Hoes😂
Border was secure under Trump, why does she keep trying to blame him?
31/2 years as the border czar and now she wants to fix the border???
21:18 what experiment???? 😂😂😂😂
I question the sanity of every person voting for this lady
Kamala Harris can’t ever answer the question
may I react to this video?
This lady has no clue what she has done. Answer gash darn questions or leave!
Why can’t she just answer a question any question ever?  She just blames Trump for everything!  She doesn’t have a clue what she’s doing!
hmm, is she wearing the same earings during the debate with trump?
Anyone notice she's wearing her special earrings again??
Why did you allow this stupid woman to continue mumbling ahead ?????
They don’t have a concern about Donald Trump and you’re avoiding the question
dancing around questions like shes in the olimpics
She's is trying to run out the time, so the interview can be over. She has not answered one question
You have 26min to interview a presidential candidate and you asked them about Joe Biden’s health?? Why?
She is completely rattled over a few questions. How can someone so easily rattled be our President? Not presidential in character nor in fortitude.
And Barak Obama gave back to Iran how many billions back?????
How many times did she say "Trump"???.😂
She’s not used to having anybody make her answer questions! She does not know what she is talking about
When will MAGA think for themselves instead of having people tell them what to think?
What would she have to say if Trump wasn't involved?
What's the Indian word for liar ?
Which country in the world does Kamala Harris live in?
What about her staff? She can’t keep a staff!!! she fires or they quit right and left!!
Are those the bluetooth earrings again?
This is what it looks like when Kamala is actually asked difficult questions. She crumbled like a sandcastle in a flood. Fantastic job, Brett!
It was nice seeing her get grilled with real questions in a real interview
Is it possible for Kamala to be more dishonest?
This entire thing was question-dodging and lies.   She's despicable.
This not Oprah cozy interview but tough questions which should be. Politicians must be grilled. But he should let her talk..
Who was the brain surgeon that picked this empty pantsuit! OMG!!!
Is this woman an example for the Leader of the free world...... would America be safe under her stewardship?
Am I the only one hearing a smoke detector chirping?  No joke.
How do you ask a person a question and in the middle of an answer just cut the person off?  Then do it over and over again?  True, it's politics, they rarely give "straight answers," but still.
So will Trump be doing an interview with MSNBC?
why did she not answer the questions
Whenever you press her on questions, she gets highly defensive and tries to over talk.
She has only three possible responses to a question:  1. Blame Trump 2. Deflect the question entirely via word salad. 3. "I'll follow the law regarding that".
Imagining trump trying to answer questions of this calibre bahahaha. He's pathetic.
She has such a silver spoon that she has no idea the difference between needs and wants?
I'd like to know how many questions she actually answered?
She still won’t answer a question straight up.
Wow she can’t even answer the questions
She certainly seems to have shared her plans with many, yet she hasn’t said what her plans are publicly? Why if it’s so great?
He needed to shut up and let her speak, that's what you do when you're asking questions.
SHOCKING how this didn't pop up on my feed... only critique would be more highlighting and vocalizing how she doesn't answer the question when she eventually finishes.
If you can't give a straight answer, you are most likely lying or avoiding the question.
Why she yelling, he's just asking questions, she's getting mad
The pint is  ..1 million  ... 3  million ... 10 million?
Finally!! Someone who asks real questions!
Not only does she not answer the question she doesn't understand own answers.
correct me if i am wrong but the staff that claim the negative statements about trump.....werent tehy fired by trump, hence the reason they would say negative things about him?
Brett should've given her multiple choice answers did like CNN did when she interviewed with her support governor, bout time shes called on the carpet
She diverts every direct question into spinning her own narrative, its actually so disturbing to watch.
I've been watching, and I'm still waiting for her to answer a question! Geeez.
Wasn’t some of these questions yes or no answers, she failed to answer, and what is her point exactly, I haven’t herd what her policy for American people not refugees ,how is gonna fix things
Is that an accident that she keeps choosing those same earrings when she goes to interviews ? Just wondering
If Iran is our greatest threat, why are they wanting to attack Trump and not the current administration.
ask yourself, can you see her as leader of the free world...... negotiating with heads of state?
She can't answer a question
Lol, this guy trying so hard to create his viral moment. You’d think a pro would know better than to just keep asking different questions while somebody’s answering them
Bret: *Asks a question* Kamala: *Begins to answer* Bret after two seconds: *Cuts her off so she can’t finish her response*
What about her staff? She can’t keep a staff!!! she fires or they quit right and left!!
Harris is UNABLE to answer SIMPLE questions.......
$25,000 for a house? How'd that EV tax credit work out?
if anyone notice when she can’t answer the question she stutter!
Harris can't even answer the question.  Dumb
OMG,she can't answer a darn question,changes subject
Why is half the country supporting him? Is that a serious question? The majority of Maga voters vote based off 3 things, abortion, guns, and because mommy and daddy raised them to be conservative. They have no original thought.
Is she wearing her microphone earrings?
Wasn't trump's wall supposed to fix immigration?
Ask her to give you an answer...she's trying to snowball you
Can she recite just one of those polices AND how she plans to do that without putting more strain on the taxpayers
She’s not capable of answering a question
does she only have 0ne pair of Earrings................???????
How about less people being let in, rather than facilitating this invasion. Then you wouldn't need all those additional resources.
Fair and affordable housing for whom ?
Brett, please shut the f up and let her put her foot in her mouth! Every time she gets ready to crash and burn you stop her and change the question!!
Did Trump pay her to campaign for Trump?
Kamala avoids the question... over 10 million on Biden & her watch have crossed our border!!! All she does is talk salad words.   Kamala Harris... "I'm Speaking" but not saying anything! All she is doing is LYING to the American people!!!
She made herself look like a fool. shouldn't have been that difficult to answer a straight forward question. But then she can't even answer the easiest questions either. She came off as an angry person.
Does Kamala ha e sinus disease, she sounds like she has nasal congestion.
She cant answer ONE question
Spent the better part of her career locking up  (mostly) black men,  and brown men, white men, keeping them locked up past their sentences. Was thst following the law? Was hiding evidence following the law? Convicting innocent men and hiding evidence to do so, that must of been following the law.
Sleepy Joe, where are you now? 😂
Is she going to pay for all of her pipe dreams out of her pocket?!
She has those blue tooth earrings in n still can't speak logically never answers questions redact
This made me wonder if she has read the 80 pages on her website?
It's hard to answer questions when you have an IQ of 36
18:23 was that a freakin smoke alarm?! Hahaha
Fix the problem that you created? And then blame Trump.
I thought she walked off???
He did a great job. Pin her down and keep her to the question. She still managed to continue the lies and talk over him.
Where is the record of the mystery call from Trump where he successfully killed their bill while out of office? So sick of hearing about this fake call being to blame
Inflation reduction act?
First question out the gate she don't answer
Good God if this woman ever actually answered a direct question I think I'd drop dead.
Fix the problem that you created? And then blame Trump.
What she smoking on this first question?
What the hell is she talking about?
Bret, why didn't Biden or Harris reach out to those parents immediately after their children were murdered? Why haven't they closed the border? Why is Kamala not admitting Biden was compromised? Kamala took control over this conversion. Much lighter than Trumps interview.
The simple question that never gets asked of her or Biden is “Why was Trump’s remain in Mexico policy rescinded?”
Don’t understand why she can’t just answer ONE question that is ever asked of her!!!!!  Good Lord!
She never truely answers the question . She just dances around the questions 😳😳😳😳
Quite hilarious! Do you think her technique of talking over people looks good, or just rude?
Why did she come to fox? It did her a disservice
She’s got 80 pages of policies but can never talk about them? Does she even know what they all are?
She should have been pressed more
How can you have so much content with so little substance ?!
She still never ever answers questions
He asked you if you regret it...uugghh here we go
If u get it then why are they endorsing trump an not u
Brett did a good job! She avoided answering his question by turning it all about Trump and her babbling.
What the hell is she talking about???
She gets UNHINGED over easy questions…that she simply cannot handle!
A lot of deflection here
Why do you need more border agents if you have less people coming in?  That is the question that should have been asked.
Brett those questions are on point!!! Keep on!! This is what journalism should look like like not 1 sided facts..👏👏👏
How the hell does an additional 1500 Border Patrol Agents stop 6 million flooding across?
Hey Kamala, it's an INTERVIEW not monologue/ speech time. Do that in the corner of your own room by yourself
Does she think we’re that dumb lol 😂 things have been worst since you guys took office turn page on what ? We are exhausted 😴 of you guys
When is she gonna actually let us know what her plans are othrer than give away money that we dont have anyway plus she would have to get all that through congress good luck youll need it i mean who does she think she is Bill Clinton shes not as gifted as he with the gift of gab i know BS when i hear it
I can feel the fear in her face everytime the big questions hit hahaha and she resorted to just talking over the points that she didn't want to answer.
Feeling sorry for someone's loss if far from an apology.
These are just the same old questions Harris always gets, and she answers them always in same old way. Very dissapointing Fox.
Affordable housing for WHO???
What is wrong with her?  Answer the question at hand!
For God’s sake, can the woman answer a question? She’s completely vacuous…
Can she even answer a question?????? How can you vote for anyone that can’t answer a question direct!!
Why doesn't she answer the question
Every single question was deflected. This is ridiculous.
The Question Is: Do You Love Your Country - More Than You Hate Trump? Stop The Hate…
She bombed this interview from the very first question.
Can she speak off script? Holy cow. She says the same lines, verbatim, every time
Doesn't she have any other earrings?
Can she actuallly responde and not make word salad?
How is this not on top stories in the news section YouTube? Suspicious…
Do you ever notice when she talks? It sounds like she’s talking through her nose.
Are they stupid?   Shes like "I would never say that. .. ......"   but she thinks it for sure
Finally a true journalist asking her follow up questions. ❤
Good grief! The woman never shuts up but never really answers a question. Somebody, please shove a sock in her mouth and send her on a permanent vacation to Afghanistan.
Everytime she references her time as AG, the follow up should always be: why did you try to have a man you knew was innocent executed?
Just answer the question!!!! 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Politics aside these questions are so one sided lol
Talk about dodging questions did you all see the trump interview on 60 minutes? You know the one where he dodged the whole show?
The bill had nothing to do with the question. She’s so dumb she thinks the people are sheep.
How come you can’t handle any criticism
Notice how she says let’s get to a point but still the point is answering the question and she never does
Wait, was this a South Park episode?
Hear is a question to ask her. If you are an American in prison and you need emergency gallbladder surgery, or eye surgery or any other surgery is the state of California going to pay for it? The answer is Hell NO!
And to think stupid people are gonna vote for some airhead that wants to do something now that she's running for President.Un honest and can't even answer a simple question,unreal!
Skip the first 20 seconds every time Kamal is asked a question and you'll still get no answer.
I love Kamala when people asked Slightly hard questions! This  interview straight 26 minutes of Kamala Avoiding questions
Does she have those pearl microphone earrings on again??
What ideas? Never worked outside of a government position. Sadly she can only turn a blank page!
Medically necessary gender transition surgery?? What a joke!!
She is the worst candidate I think we’ve ever had how is it possible that she couldn’t answer a single question
Wow she could not answer the trans question about inmates hahaha crazy
What is her plan for strengthening the economy? Asoka her a point blank question
Facts???? She never stays to the facts.
Brett 🐻 .......ahhhhh finally someone that asks questions like a normal human 😂
She conspicuously walked around every single legitimate question asked of her.  Remember that when you vote, fellow Americans.
Does anybody want a president that can't take responsibility for her own a actions?
Why did 6 million shock her?
Side stepping every question or blaming it on Trump. Weakness is all around her
Answer the question lady, what a joke, she really makes intelligent women look stupid. Your plan is all smoke ... all she talks about is Trump, no policy
Very bad faith interviewer
How many times was it President Trumps fault? Anyone keep count?
Why is the like button disabled? Youtube.
Sometimes I wish they would just say, "Can we have an answer that you havent already recited, Madame Vice President.... without citing your prosecutorial history (which never has anything to do with what you are asked) or hiding behind your attacks on Trump, or talking about your middle-class, childhood lawn or making french fries at McDonald's?"
Here word salad non-answer to the very first question made me nauseous.  It's impossible to imagine someone less qualified to hold her last job let alone the one she is running for.
Are those the blue tooth earrings again!!!!!!!1
GREAT QUESTIONS, AND GOOD ANSWERS. SHE IS THE CLEAR CHOICE.
I have a question, did Trump apologize to the families of the lives that were lost because of Jan.6? I don't like Him or Her but I have to vote for one. Honestly Trump isn't making it easy with the foolishness and Kamala with the Homosexual agenda
Where are the facts ? I still don’t have a dam clue what this administration has planned!!
20:45 This. This is the only question I needed answered. I voted for Biden, and I knew he was being hidden way before that disastrous debate. I can handle a lot of political games, but she is outright lying and has lost my vote.
Do any of you know how government works? The senate is always 50 50 and has anyone heard of the legislative filibuster?
She doesn’t answer anything, she just skates around the question
Why did she give a salad when Brett had asked for a number?
The gall to insist she finish her response when she does not answer the question.
Who was the dummy who chose Brett hair for this?
Why is he letting her run the interview..... 🙄
She seems so confused that he's asking her questions about her policies.  Her expression is like, "Why are you asking about what I believe, I thought we were just going to sit down and bash Trump. That's what I get to do in all my other interviews"
Why did you allow her to wear those earrings?
Clear? Foggy is all
Take a shot of whiskey for every question she doesn’t genuinely answer,…you will be blitzed in seconds. The ultimate drinking game. 🥃
She is finally getting ask hard questions. She is getting her butt kicked
How madam VP can you expect to fix the Immigration issue by cancelling what the previous President had going that was strengthening the border in the first place? The logic does not hold at all!!
She just cant an would not answer the Qestions
When you vote, ask yourself:  Do you want the Great Reset?  Or  Do you want an Independent United States of America?  Vote Trump for the latter.
About time she gets questions that call her record out.
She can’t answer a simple question.
He asked for a NUMBER, not a salad. bring the heat with $XAI895T we gonna have a huge year btw
How much wine did she have pre interview?
Thank you Breit for asking and pressing to receive clear answers to questions I was hoping you'd address.
i only hear trump talk about kamala or bidan what the heck is she talking about!
She always wears those earrings I wonder why
good job Brett ask the stuff i really want to know
this nincompoop didn't answer one single question
I'm a couple minutes in and I don't know if I can do 30 minutes of her bs. Answer the questions. Don't give a speech and cut off the interviewer.
Q:  Do you owe these victims an apology? This $XAI895T is actually lit
Why would she get rid of the filibuster when she is so good at it? Answer the freaking question!
Was she sniffing paint or gasoline before the interview🤔
If you watch this and still plan to vote for Kamala I just have one question for you. What's your favorite flavor of crayons?
Again she not answering direct questions. The cuts her off because it just lies with word salads.
What you do for Americans  people  Kamala?
Just answer the dang questions, woman!
Ignorant woman didn’t answer a SINGLE question.  Empty vessel. Dumb as a rock.
Wow she becomes unraveled on the first question. She's a joke and can't handle much
More Bluetooth earrings 😅 🎤 ?
Why does Bret keep interrupting the future POTUS?!
Where is her ethnic accents? Where are the cackles? I’m still waiting for her middle class fable…maybe I’m too early?
How does he have no plan when you can’t even answer a single question honestly. This lying skin walker can’t not be president
I would hate to see how she handles priorities in her house?
She had ; years and why didn’t she fix it????
Kamala has more balls than tRump.  Was no crossing arms like a 5 year old when asked a real question.
What is her plan? I’m still waiting to hear it!!
Ignorant woman didn’t answer a SINGLE question.  Empty vessel. Dumb as a rock.
What is your favorite restaurant?  Well, Donald trump…
Why is he interrupting? He is trying to trap her. But she is strong! 💪
Please show us your question to Trump, don't show us a clip where he switches off to another topic
Plans what are they???????
Wow. The interviewer asked some tough questions!!!!
Can she at the very least apologize for causing the tragedies? !
Finally an interview asking her real questions. Thank you Fox
Why isn't she laughing like she usually does during these interviews?
Where has your plan been in the last 4 years ?
How come nobody is talking about why the bill was killed? It because all the PORK in the bill the democrats where trying to pass in the bill. Thank God the Republicans killed the bill.
It’s not supposed to be easy, well how did you get here?
She won’t answer the question 🙋
How many? Still won’t say how many!
Lies,  lies, lies.  Why is she so angry?  Oh right REAL questions. hope more believe and understand $XAI895T after all
Q:  How many illegal immigrants have entered the US under your administration? how long is $XAI895T rdy for us?
She literally is incapable of answering a question without talking about Trump. She's got major TDS. how long is $XAI895T opened to us?
Not one question answered and always casting blame.
Why does she change her accent every time she talks?
Ummm isn’t the whole trump secret documents thing about a plan to go to war with Iran…..like for what reason…. Apparently they are creating the scenario in front of our face
I respect you, Bret.  Your questioning in this segment brings me back to the days of honest journalism.  Thanks, Bret.  You did a great job!
Same earrings as the debate
SHE CANNOT ANSWER QUESTIONS!!!!
Why can’t two people speak to each other without any childish antics? I miss the 90’s.
Takes 5 minutes to answer a single question and ends up not actually answering anything
How is it possible that this person is somehow a candidate for President of the United States? 🤣
Is this our life like really..is this the best America has to offer..all these brilliant minds here and this is what we get
It’s absolutely mind blowing how they can repeatedly call Trump divisive whilst calling him a threat to democracy, an existential threat, a Putin puppet, a danger to America but apparently that language isn’t divisive? How do they not see the contradiction and why aren’t they called out on it constantly? Anything good they have done but anything bad it’s still Trumps fault. Crazy.
Does she even hear herself?!?! Why are you yelling?? We can hear you. You don’t need to scream. Stop deflecting and blaming someone else for your own shortcomings. You should be ashamed of yourself Madame Vice President.
She's trying to hide her real self. She dodged the questions, but not really very convincingly. She's poor at telling the truth and she's not especially good at lying. She's only competent at being incompetent.
Is Fox doing their Job ??
Ignorance?? Maybe?? Just maybe…
Answer the F’ing question you stupid B’it*ch!!!!
Can she answer any question without talking about Donald Trump?
The last decade? Hmmm.....let's see. During the last decade Obama was POTUS for 8 years. Trump for 4 years and Biden for 3.5 years. The math makes no sense. She's a weasel.
How many? She will not give us a number!
Did she say Biden was an experiment? 🔬
Q:  Why do 79% of Americans think the country is on the wrong track? bring the heat with $XAI895T we gonna have a huge year btw
If the immigration system is so broken why is an anchor baby the VP and up to be the American President?? Why are there so many foreigners in government yet there are no pathways??
Her answer to every question is but but but Donald Trump
Bret did a good job with good questions...🇺🇸 Trump/Vance 🇺🇸
How’s that wall coming along that Trump promised voters?Mexico was going to pay for it too.
If i could ask her one question it would be "How do you feel being a puppet?" That arrogance of hers, could you imagine the look she'd give you ..
Can she answer a question without mentioning Donald Trump?
Answer his question????    Did you and Biden undo Trumps policies or not???   More word salad...    Diverge from the topic and get lost from what she was asked
She cannot answer ANY question! It’s pathetic.
Are those the same Earings???
What f'ing planet is she living on.
This interview should be not me to these questions.  They are to hard
Madam Vice President what did you have for breakfast this morning?  Harris - "Donald Trump"
She is all aboit deflect to Trump, not talk about what she believes
Question are the PAGeS plagiarism lie get book
Finally. Somebody is hitting her with the questions that need to be asked.
And none of it would work. That still doesn't answer the question.
Why does she slakways blame Trump?
The more I watch the more I m freaking.I think she didn’t understand English , didn’t understand the question 😅😅😅
If Donald Trump wants so bad to deport immigrants will he also deport his wife and in-laws who he petitioned for to get her original visa, will he also stop using immigration labor to work his hotels and resorts? I can assure you his maids, cooks , groundskeepers and other laborers are not natural born Americans.
He was grillin her good job
Does this woman not have another pair of earrings!!!
This is not a train wreck, this is a plane crash Who of you also got into XAI895T after this
Bret is a tool. If you ask a question, let the other person respond. Not assuming what she has to answer to address your point. 101 manners. Her answering with Trump being the reason for issue all the time not helpful either. Just two clowns running for a president. Disgrace for a country with so many talented people 😢
Answer the question…..
Does she ever answer the question?  All I hear is projection and hypocrisy from our Vice President.
Does it Even Matter Anymore?? She WILL NEVER ANSWER THE QUESTION TRUTHFULLY OR AT ALL!! with XAI895T arriving the best is yet to come, you could know that!
When Kamala Harris points her finger it shows her frustration with the question
That was hard to watch. She failed this hard and now want to go on Rogan?!?!?! He's going to eat her alive and wont just move on when she refuses to answer a simple question. I can't wait
She talked about Trump every single time he asked a question. She didn't even properly answer any questions. She dodged them and made a giant word salad as always.
i wish someone would just repeat the same question over and over until she actually answered it. the XAI895T move is assisting us mark my words
Brett, Brett, Brett, The question " When in your mind did it become a crisis?"  Harris on the view " Nothing comes to mind "... I think I get why I can't stand her.... It's that pleading, whiney voice that comes through her nose...It just doesn't instill confidence, and I don't think Putin would listen to that either.
She can't answer a question without using Trump as a pivot point.
Jesus she didn’t answer a single question
This is not a train wreck, this is a plane crash Who of you also got into XAI895T after this
I wonder is she's serving croutons with that salad? Geez!
Some of these questions are so stupid, a vice president doesnt make any policy they are there to carry out the president's agenda, im sure bret knows that
Some of you think she is qualified for President? God help the US.
How does Kamala Harris sleep at night with all her lies? Despicable.
Why doesn't she answer any questions directly?
If an IQ under 80 means you’re mentally deficient, why can’t we bar those people from voting? Kamala would get ZERO votes and the country would do SOOOO much better! Let’s make it so you have to pass a civics test to vote!
She cant answer if she's going to spend tax dollars on trans surgery for prisoners? How is she running for president and cant answer this question?
Joe Biden has mumbled and bumbled progressively worse to the point of incoherence by the American people and VP Harris, why didn't you say anything 1, 2, or 3 years ago? You put us all in serious jeopardy.
Find me one piece of proof that Trump ever said he prison political opponents
How is she going to pay for it
So where do I go to see Trump's proposed policies??????
I would be nice to let her answer the question before interrupting
What has she intended to do these past 4years????
Dear G_d, does Brett want to talk all the way through the time allowed? Is he going to let her finish a point, a thought? She is speaking and a good interviewer let's the other person talk without constant interruptions.
Who made them wrap up so suddenly…. Fox media or was it her administration trying to get her to stop talking
How many times does she say rederick?  Good lord, I don’t think if she couldn’t say Donald Trump she wouldn’t be able to talk!
something sinister is happening. How in the world she ended up here? People didn't even wanted her for VP
Who told her it was smart to go to Fox News and how did you convince her she could handle it after multiple softballll interviews? 🤣🤣🤣
I was waiting for her to start talking Jamaican, Leperchaun or the "Are you ok" in broken english...............so sad
Nice to hear the questions actually asked!!!
Why has 92% of your staff quit after saying they can't take your abuse any more!!!
Smoke detector chirp 18:22?
She can’t answer ONE single QUESTION…yes.. these women among hundreds of others were killed and all you can say is.. I am sorry for their loss?!?!
No the point is you are not answering the question; are you just dumb or deaf?  Answer the question!
21:15 is there such thing as double check mate 😂😭🤣😂😭🤡
Did you notice she is wearing those same earrings from the debate.
Will there be a peaceful transition of power if Trump wins?
Funny how all of these questions are about HER & seemingly for once she cannot talk about herself but only wants to talk about Trump.
How come no one talks about what else was a part of the Border $118 billion dollar bill, like $60 billion to Ukraine and $14 Billion for Israel and who knows what else. Only a small portion was going to the Border issue.
How is everything trumps fault? Take some ownership. She’s so fake
Yes or no please just answer the question
So they broke it completely trying to fix it?  Now we know not to allow them to “fix” anything.
Ask willie brown about her life experiences
Question one….she was toast.
Must SUCK not being pre-fed the questions!
Why won't Mike Pence endorse Trump?
Hurricane Milton has nothing on  Comrad Kamala, this moron is a walking time bomb cannot answer a question without mentioning Trump...
You know how a dog hollers when you’re beating it for what it did on the floor?! That’s how she acts or rather reacts to questions!
These questions are so pathetic, and so biased. They wouldnt dare talk over Trump are ask him tough questions as they are so focus on babying him, and editing his BS, and trying to guide him back on Trump when he rambles. He asked her no questions about her policies, just spewed MAGA talking point. It was really unfair to the viewers. All Fox has done was show why they are least reputable, least respected, most unserious news outlets.
i wish someone would just repeat the same question over and over until she actually answered it. the XAI895T move is assisting us mark my words
Donald trump never handled this cain the question  he is think skin.
Finally, a tough interview
She can't answer a single question.
What’re they going to blame once Trump is dead and gone? 😂
Was she doing a Nancy Pelosi impression after the 16 minute mark? Hand movements and everything.
Earings?
Last decade???  2014, 2015, 2016 Obama 17, 18, 19, 20 Trump 21, 22, 23, 24 Biden Seems to me the Democrats have been in office the majority of the decade.
What about going after the 20 million illegal immigrants you allowed into this country shouldn't you be prosecuted?
THIS WOMAN TALKS TOOOOOO DAM MUCH.  TALKS TALKS TALKS AND DOESNT ANSWER THE F’ING QUESTION
Did this |{amel hump her way to the t○p? She is disgusting.
Someone should ask Trump these questions and listen to how stupid he sounds when he talks. He’s old and loosing his mind
i dont mind democrats in general, i dont even mind a lot of the radical left so long as they use democratic means to (try) to push the issues they feel are important but, what i cant stand - and find infuriating, is when politicians ask for your vote but refuse to answer a question - instead drag on generalities hoping the audience will lose focus on the original question asked.
When is anybody going to address that she's wearing the exact same earrings does she wore on the debate and every single interview that she does has the same earrings. Ladies do you wear the exact same earrings all the time??
"Turn the page"? How's she gonna turn the page when between every sentence she defaults to slam Trump. "Like leaders of the intelligence community"? Did that include the 51 who signed off on the scam of the week?
She never answers the question directly. Just blame.
She answers nothing.
Q:  Do you owe these victims an apology? wanna know more about XAI895T too dude
She looks too weak, how can she talk to other countries? We have to be wise about our election
Hahaha she can't answer a single question. Love her going ballistic and then noticeably working to keep calm.  Iran is the #1 threat...let's give them some money!😅
How many lies can she tell?
😂 she never answers a question
She attached trump so much for what is happening TODAY.  An answer to a question is not based on saying if Trump is good or bad. Answer the question and let us decide.
The Tim Walz question had her frozen in time literally
Why does she keep wearing the same earrings? ... That's very odd.
Q:  Why do 79% of Americans think the country is on the wrong track? you guys rly should take part in XAI895T at this point
No wicket laugh 😆 with the folks from Fox ?
So you’re not going to answer the question!’
Can any Kamala supporter here tell me the best response she gave without mentioning "Trump"?
What the hell is this? 😂🎉😂🎉
She’s such a lair and can not answer questions directly, and as always Trump is to blame..🤷🏻‍♂️
Q:  How many illegal immigrants have entered the US under your administration? wanna know more about XAI895T too bro
Never a straight answer with this Lady
Did she have an earpiece? She couldn’t possibly have any “facts” in her head.
She has not answered questions and has not taken responsibility for what she has done.
Word salad is not a plan! Who's going to pay for your Christmas Tree of FREEBIES??? The top 1% of income earners already pay 43% of all taxes collected...paying more than their "FAIR" Share!!! They will pack up and leave with their money! Your handouts only happen if they can fit an extremely narrow window or they start a business that makes more than $50k first in order to get a deduction!
What does the Iranian culture think of a woman leader?
How come nobody ever asks her or biden why they changed the policies? Explain THAT to us and the parents of victims? How was changing trumps policies n catch a release a good thing for the country?? Make them answer those questions. And ask the reason why they did it....period. instead if these stupid games trying to get a sound bite of her apologizing.
Thanks Madam president for answering the question also dealing with fox rudeness of never letting pple talk but thinks that helps their stand with d maga pple, Madam president u were great as always…
She cannot answer a question to save her life. So far behind she needs to do this interview and this sure didn’t help her case for POTUS.
Look at all the questions Brets got in his hands geez he went in to nail her to the wall well kudos to Kamala Harris  she stood up and nailed his arse as he couldn't wait to get off what a frigin coward
Grilled? Roasted is a better word!
Thank you for asking real questions. It would be nice if she’d answer just one question.
This was so hard to watch. I have a genuine question for anybody who is going to vote for Kamala. Without bringing up Donald Trump, why are you supporting her?
She starts off by not answering questions
Why did DoD Directive 5240.1 just get amended on 9/27/2024 to allow the military to use LETHAL force on Americans  while assisting local law enforcement during times of civil unrest???
Isn't Fox Entertainment the one that got sued for a billion dollars for lying?
Did she really do this interview to not answer a single question?
If the immigration system is so bad, then why didn't Trump and some Republicans support the Immigration Bill?
Tightening up the border.. penalize those who break legal crossing...when!!!!!??? whose the liar?
Anyone else enjoy watching her crumble as much as I do? I might enjoy it a little too much 😅.  Trump 2024
This is hard to watch her respond to actual questions for the first time. Ouch
I wonder if she has read her own policies yet? What a joke!
Answer the questions…
Did she even answer 1 question ?
She got ideas??? Yet she can't talk.without a teleprompter
How was it fox fans? A real interview that was coherent and not sundown at the nursing home.
Ask her about the negative things she said during the debate, abt Joe Biden, & vice-versa.
Only 26 minutes? I thought this was gonna be at least an hour? Nah I'm not conviced.
Her administration removed those Trump sanctions against Iran the first week they took office and why did Bret Baier not tell her that.
Gosh she is NOT ANSWERING ANYTHING!!!
Kamala: How can i say lot's of words without saying anything? Twump did it i pwomise c'mon mon.
Fentanyl is pronounced FENT-IN-ILL. Why do people struggle so hard with this simple world?
So Kamala did you not notice in 3.5 years concerns about Joes cognitive abilities?   Well I do know the American people have concerns about Donald Trump.  Nice Kamala, nice 👍
What does he keep talking over her? What a loser!!
Democrats never answer the question asked to them
She NEVER answers a question.
How you don't interrupt someone who talks for 45 minutes without saying anything and without getting to the point?
Did she answer any of Bret's questions?
Harris cannot provide a direct concise and honest answer to any question asked.
Has she been drinking?  Sounds like she's going to cry?!?!  What a liar and a loser!!
All she does is play the blame game 🎯 she still can't answer the questions. And also lie after lie after 🤥🤥🤥🤡
This is unreal. Watch the way she evades the questions. What a disgrace.
If people don’t realize that is an actor by now .. cmon people ..
How many times can one person say the word "clear" in 25 minutes?
She should just answer the question that was asked. Just come up with a number, Trump just lies every time he opens his mouth and looks strong by comparison.
Where is the interview ..it’s disappeared
Has anyone noticed her earrings? Aren’t they the same o es she wore during the debate?
What an idiot. Deflects every serious question.
Answer the friggen questions, don't vomit words Kamala.
Ask Willie Brown for her PERSONAL EXPERIENCES😂😂😂
She undid 99 of Trump’s executive orders on immigration. Why?
The point is how many in the first 10 seconds. No aswer
Is she the future for the U.S. what do you think? Would love to hear. Thx.
I’m am pleasantly surprised Brett asked deep questions with hard follow ups. He retained his impartiality and professionalism
Are you kidding me Joe is more stable than Trump I never saw Trump fall up the stairs
How much border could a border bill build if a border bill could build borders?
Way to go abret Baier. You asked real questions and she couldn't handle it.
Still won't answer the questions
Wow. Does anyone fall for her? 😂
Does Trump owe the Capital Police officers and their families an apology?? Hhhhmmmmm???
why did she not attend congress when israel president was in washington? if she cares so much about israel
Am I the only one that noticed she is shaking her head in a "no" motion while saying "I'm so sorry for their loss"? We all know what that means. Based on signs and body language experts, when you answer "yes" or in her case "sorry for their loss" but you move your head in a "no" motion, the movement is actually what tells the true and not the words. She is changing the head movement into a "yes" motion when she continues saying "sincerely". So, she sincerely confirms that she's not sorry. We can all see her true feelings about the illegal immigrants released in USA that committed those crimes. She doesn't care.
And are they plagiarized?
Trump would still trying to Answer the first question. She did great. Only smart people gets it.
Bret ask nothing important and just tried to bully her.
Great job Brett Baier and FOX,,Finally a real interview asking the tough questions instead of fluff
Omg are you going to use tax payer money to give plastic surgery to trans inmates or not??!!!
Breit did good job wt question ask as she usual does salad mix anwears does'nt macht any way just vote right man to office TRUMP.2024 ❤❤❤
Well what creepy little cult meeting have i stumbled into in this comments section
Do you even know what the 80 pages on your website say?
Every question is avoided without a clear answer. Wow.
Why is she so angry? Someone give her a blood pressure pill. 😂
Answer the question you fool
When she made her claims about trump, I would have said "oh yea, like what for example?"
Has she answered any of the questions 🤔🤔
Why interview her if you wont allow her to speak?
How bad is ,la’s internal polling that she felt she needed to sit down with Brett?
where is david muir to help kamala??? ..... :-)
Just have to ask Bret, what that the most annoying interview you've done?
And allway looking to who to blame others
Not answering the question
Why is she so mad?😂😂😂
Brett you were fantastic great questions with no answers from the sick demorat puppy.
Answer a frick’n question lady!!! Ugh lady you can’t run a stocking and you want to run this country! All you and Biden have done is ruin this country!! USA 🇺🇸
Does anyone know what she is talking about???
Why would she even do this interview?  Desperation is a stinky cologne.
Is that womansplaninng ?
She is so hard to watch and listen to - just agitated the whole time. When she will sit with tough world leaders- does she think she can just wave her hand and shut down conversations in an agitated way? She is not diplomatic - Not very presidential. Very dissapointing.
Thank goodness a real reporter asked real questions
Why isn't Fox uploading the unedited version? Why are there so many cut scenes?   I want to hear what she actually said, not what Fox wants the sheep to see.
Did she just rage quit at the last moment ?🤣
Does she wear the same earrings everyday?.... just wondering.
All his questions are like “When did your wife catch you cheating on her” type of questions.   He loads it up with false presuppositions. Bad interviewer.
Finally having to face real questions and getting fact checked, now you finally see what it’s like being the nail.
Elegy did Harris & Biden rescind Trumps policies?  Why did they sell the remaining wall material for Penny’s on the dollar.
Will she ever just answer a question?
Looks like she’s getting mad why cause she’s getting asked real questions
Past 10 years? 6 of them were under Obama/Biden and Biden/Harris. Sense a trend?
I’m glad someone is finally asking real questions even if she won’t answer them. Trump 2024
She doesn’t answer anything are you sure she is president 😂
Why is sheeheee defensive😂
Can she even say anything true?
Hmmmm, I've seen those earrings on her a little too often...
What’s her plan on all this?  I’ve never heard it…. She’s very clear
21:55 the question was, regarding BIDEN, you didn't have any concerns VP Kamala?  ...the answer never came.   Just more pointing fingers at the scapegoat 👉 "Trump". 👈
Is this really comedy central???
She can’t even answer simple questions without a condescending, pompous attitude. TRUMP 2024!!!!
She has certain talking points that she uses for EVERY question. Nothing about her middle class upbringing. She will use that twice next interview.
22 minutes in and she still has not answered even ONE question.
what has she been doing all these years? since she has soooo many plans now ?
And does money grow on trees. No coming from us tax payers money
How is posible was kamala vp for four years 👎🏽
Why hasn’t she done all that’s she’s going on about.
Can we have interviews where she is not allowed to mention Trump? Just talk about her policies and address issues that affect the American people!
He asked Kamala, if that's the case, why is half the country supporting Donald Trump? He does realize that half of the country has an education of a high school diploma or less, right? Those are the people who are overwhelmingly supporting Donald Trump.
Why does she always wear microphone earrings and the same outfits in different different colors like men's suits
Has she never seen special report? This was awful for her. Somebody messed up.
So...when is trump going to let himself be interviewed by Rachel Maddow?  Turnabout is fair play...
When someone asks you a question, they KNOW what the point of their question is. 🙄
Is she wearing the same earrings she wore at the debate??
Does she hear herself……thank God she doesn’t point fingers or call names about Trump or his supporters. That’s all she talks about.
Why does she always wear microphone earrings and the same outfits in different different colors like men's suits
Why does she always wear those earrings?
So Kamala, just what is your plans??? More deflections, less truth! That is what I hear coming from you.😞
Poor thing can’t even follow his questions
Most annoying woman who will NOT answer the qn.
stop avoiding answers questions being asked of you.
Please do not vote for anyone who cannot answer a question with a straight answer. Kamala Harris didn’t answer one question.
If her plans are so great why is our country so broken under her watch?
Why 50% Americans are stupid to believe her? It's a curious case for R&D.
Does she even have an  answer or is it marxist double talk
Shes grinning about 8 minutes after thinks she survived immigration question and appears to be a daily Pot User the Entire interview.
stop avoiding answers questions being asked of you.
Omg she can’t even answer 1 question!
Why is Brett debating Isn’t it supposed to be an interview?
Thank you for showing this group of ppl how to answer a question VP💙. I hope the 🍊 guy is watching so he can learn a thing or 2.
How about the "WALL" construction that was aborted ...or wait .. Kommie...you guys like abortion.
Why didn’t you answer those question!
She goes on a big speech but doesn't answer the question.
She never answers the question
Did anyone notice that she wore those earrings that she wore during the debate with Donald Trump?
She still didn't give any straight answers
She evaded questions again.
why was Biden thrown under the bus
Where was she in the last 10 years????
Woooow!  Now what???? After we heard all of this.... what now?
cant have a conversation if you wont let the interviewer finish his question. Scary to see people who would actually vote for this women.
So the BLM "Protests" that cost this country Billions of Dollars were Peaceful??
Kamla Harris doesn't even seems like a real person. Why does everything that she says seems like a made up?  Why she feels like a clown dude?
@6:55 did anyone see a slight smirk when she’s “apologizing”?
How many times did she mention Trump? 😂
Bull$#+t Mountain on full display!  Rudely interrupting her answer with a Propaganda F'n question!
The question was how many criminal illegal immigrants have you and Joe Biden allowed in to the United States!! FKH
Why put a time limit on something so important? This is why podcasts are winning.
Why does Fox News have Bret Baier on their payroll? He's insufferable as an interviewer.
1 question in and not answered 😂
I would have said you’re not here to give stories you hear to ask the questions yes or no
Do normal interviews just play random clips mid talking? Usually its a conversation. This thing was 30 minues, half it was clips?
I had to search for this interview. Why was it so hard to find it?
9 months or in 2021? Which is it?
can someone please ask her how many people she has actually prosecuted? other than weed smokers. lol
Please do not vote for anyone who cannot answer a question with a straight answer. Kamala Harris didn’t answer one question.
Can she just follow the laws that are currently on the books??
She’s such an idiot ! Answer the question…
Wow, she will be minutes, MINUTES saying the same thing before switching to another word salad that do not answer the question either and then Trump.
She didn’t answer a single question!🤦🏽‍♂️ what a disgrace!
This is so hard to watch she is so bad. Does she even answer a question or does she dodge very one?
Test her hair for cocaine use.
24:05 Why is she talking like this? It's so unnatural.
16:59 , she was totally embarrassed with that question
She keeps talking about rhetoric...has she listened to herself and all her comrades? Disgusting! Atleast there's receipts with what Trump calls out. Honestly, listening to her just makes me sick.
She's afraid to answer a question with a REAL answer. Glad I've got my BOOTS on.
13:37 trump doesn't understand economics??
Idk but if she is our next president god help us all
What in the actually what actually like what was what is still what it was when it was what it were what???
Why is she wasting time repeating the question?!  Using up time. I can hardly listen to her
Who's dropped more boxers, Mohammed Ali or Kamala Harris?
She just keeps talking and trying to get you to lose focus of the question while she lists things off
WOW! Someone actually asked her the tough questions and held her feet to the fire. Brett Baier is the master, that’s what a real journalist looks like. Too bad he will never get another interview from anyone with a D after their name.
Maybe that second glass of vino with dinner was a mistake...
Boy she just will not answer a question.
Do you support transitioning men to transgender operations paid by taxpayers for prisoners Kamala?
Madam vice president what's your answer to 2+2 Donal trump
I wonder what she done. She’s going to jail. I see the guilt all in her face.
Can she whine just a little more?
Kamala just can't answer a question, because she has no stand.
She want answer the questions
Taxpayers paying for prison inmate surgery?   Why?  They r criminals...sick
Divisiveness? Rhetoric?  Your party tried to send him to prison multiple times and wannabe assassin's were trying to get to him.!!!! Harris you barely can grip reality 😂.
Answer the question about Joe!!!!!
Finally some real questions and an actual interview
Does Baier not see or understand that Harris is using him to downplay Trump with no facts.
What is with the earrings?  Does she not own any other pairs of earrings?  Or is there something special about these earrings.
She cannot respond to a question she doesn’t know the answer to without blaming Trump for something. Insane!!!!
Why can't she answer one question?  She is avoiding direct questions.   God help us  if she is elected!
She never answers a question!!!
Every question Kamala can't answer, she goes to a blame Trump talking point rant
She can't answer the questions.
How come I didn't get a notification that this video exists .
Typical gaslighting deflects if you cannot answer the question. This is how she is in office, angry. She cannot handle it.
She talks so much and says absolutely nothing. So hard to watch! Question after question, she avoids actually giving an answer or assuming responsibility for the terrible job that she has done for the last 3 1/2 years and starts with her word salad
Bret, that's not me in those adds, that's a look alike., DI I DO THAT?
Just a question but to me it seems a bit inconsistent to require them to just “admit” that they failed at the border and yet not demand the same level of accountability to the Trump party as it pertains to losing the 2020 election.  If you have time to shed some light on how it’s not it would appreciated.
Biden is  not running? The question was why did you lie about joes cognitive state
How and what will yoh do specifically, Ms. Harris?
She just cannot answer a question
She never answers the question. Never has…..never will. I feel sorry for anyone that votes for her.
Why did they end the interview?
Kamala was condending, evasive, and agressive. How anyone can vote for her based on this inteview, is the question.
Brett got her frustrated and angry she’s lost with answering questions 👍🏻
How about answering the questions you low IQ mongrel...
It's my understanding that by reducing the taxes, even of the top 1%, has a trickle down effect. The wealthy spend a lot of money, create businesses and in turn, more jobs and opportunities for lower classes. Am I wrong?
Why wont she do a debate on fox.
ASK HER ABOUT THE EARRINGS
Did anyone learn anything about her policies?  I mean what is going to be different when she is installed, ummm I mean elected.
Does anyone else notice she's still wearing the ear rings that everyone's said have speakers and she's getting talking points?
Can we get an answer a question without speaking about TRUMP
She a pro at bouncing all around “any” question and much better at lying😂😂😂….Trumps.the man🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Did anyone learn anything about her policies?  I mean what is going to be different when she is installed, ummm I mean elected.
Again not answering the question this lady needs to just shut up and answer the dam question
Sorry he's being aggressive for no reason....ask a question let her answer then response to the answer.
Once again talking about Biden, she didn’t answer the question!!!!!! If the people in this country cannot see this avoidance, you are blind !!!!!
So Trump had that much power when he was out of office? Imagine what he can do while in office!
I hope Brett ask her about his mental acuity and how long did she know he was not fit.?
Great job Brett!!!That’s a real question for that woman!!! Way to go Fox!!!
She is a gaslighter!!! wanted to keep going on her word salads without answering the question. All her time what’s spent in putting Trump down and blaming him for everything she took ZERO responsibility!
Trying to deflect questions.
How are you on the ballet😮
Holy 💩!  She hasn’t answered ONE QUESTION!!!
Why doesn't anyone talk about how inhumane trumps border policy was? Seperating parents either children and the ostrasization of immigrants.
She’s gonna lie like a rug! Nothing but lies or not answering the question that was asked! PATHETIC! 😡🤬
She can't answer a question straight up! She is ridiculous 😂
Drink every time she avoids the question
Why do they need to cut it off so short?
Answer the question!!! Tired of the double talk!!!!
Turning a page from the last decade? Is that a low blow to Obama/biden administration because biden and you were the other part of that decade of hell you have put in America.
“I’m trying to respond” lady you’re taking too long, the story you’re trying to tell is irrelevant just answer the question sheesh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Didn’t she have four years to fix all these problems?
Trump could never answer questions like this. He would start crying and walk out.
What about the policies that secured the boarder to begin with that she overturned? It was secure. Why not leave that until they could pass something else?
Just let me know when she will answer a question.
Give Harris a iq test crazy sicko
It's a reasonably fair and balanced interview - and Kamala Harris proved not to be up to the rigors of the interview - she failed the quiz miserably
What did she ever do to stop fentanyl coming in???
Kamala Harris is an Embarrassment to the World that knows her.  She did not even know how to answer his question. She’s also changed the tone in her voice to a more hostile pitch.!
Baier just asks questions then overtalks. It’s ridiculous.
She cant answer a simple question without beating around the bush😂😊
Is it just me, but her face turned gray! All she does is blame without accountability!
Always squirming around the questions.
She wanted to keep going on her word salads without answering the question. All her time what’s spent in putting Trump down and blaming him for everything she took ZERO responsibility!
Answer the questions?
She can’t answer a question. What a shame people will vote for this creature
why she did nothing to improve economy ?
She just needs to go back to laughing every time she is asked a question 😂
Do I see those bluetooth earrings?  🤣  She can't even answer a question with assistance!  STOP blaming Trump... 😱
What was the outcome of those prosecutions?  wanna bet some cartel billions are redirected?
What has this woman done in the last 4 years????
What’s your economic policies???
We want you to answer the question, what's with the filibuster??
Is this really 26min??? God i hate to listen to this bimbo! It's not really her that pisses me off it's the people that support her!
How many wars were started under Trumps administration? 000000000
Did she answer any direct question?
Take a shot 🥃 every time she mentions Trump instead of answering the question.
She filibusters and doesn’t answer the questions.
She can’t believe she is being asked real questions
Wasn't she the Border Czar or something?
Trump wants to turn the military against the American people??!! He should have called her out on DoD Directive 5240.01 that was JUST signed that would authorize military action against US citizens. Trump has never said he would use the military against us, yet it's in writing that current administration is.
Amazing how she NEVER ANSWERS ANY QUESTIONS!!!
She refuses to answer 1 question ughh
Horrible Interviewer. Asks a question and then constantly interrupts when she tries to answer. How frustrating.
She hasn’t answered one question
Bret Baier just showed us what a REAL journalist is supposed to do. Ask tough questions and call out the BS. Finally.
WHY did you STOP Remain in Mexico?? THAT is the f'ing question!!
She won't answer the questions asked. She starts explaining things away, but still not answering the question. She always tells him to let me finish, but doesn't finish answering his question first!
Kamalablahblah, answer a question without saying Trump. Go ahead, I’ll wait.
Yall saying all she talks about is trump... have you listened to him??? He's never not a single time talked about policy. I've watched every rally and townhall. He has never talked about policies or how he will do anything
No offense, but $25000 for a down.Payment for a home is nothing. homes costs so much money
KAMALA  still can't answer a question. She just blames Trump and Clueless to what she's said or going to do.
How can anyone give this person any support? Why would you vote for this person? Stop being SHEOPLE!
When Harris says we have fixes to fix the border, start asking giving what fixes specifically.
Was this SNL.
If he allowed her to answer with her word salad. There would be only one question and still not tell me anything. Blah, blah, blah....let me finish. Blah, blah, blah......
Look how shook up she gets over simple question's and can't do anything but push all the blame on PRESIDENT TRUMP she is an embarrassment to our country GOD HELP US IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT ALL SHE DOES IS LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING WHAT A JOKE
Bret should have asked why she won’t directly answer questions. It’s always story telling and lack of accountability.
This is how you answer tough questions. She sat there and took it. You don’t have to like her answers but compared to trumps rambling nonsense of generic  Words  unrelated to the questions asked at least she stayed on topic.
If she has done a good job for 4 years and left a hope to improve why border patrol union endorsed Donald Trump not her?
Good job Bret Behr!  Kamala, DODGED every question and lied through her teeth.
Where is Trump?   playing golf
If the border security wanted support, she was in office for 3 1/2 years. Why didn’t she give it to them? They were very smart to back Trump!
She refuses to out right answer a question. She just bull shits her way around it in any way she can.
Still hasn’t answered a question 🤦🏾‍♂️
Wow! That woman should rot in hell for all the lying she does! Her only action is to lie repeatedly when she can not and will not answer a question. Does she know that lying is a sin?
So which question did she answer
how does it fell Honey, the shoe on the other foot!!????
You have to shove a cattle prod up this woman's butt to get her to answer a question. She never answered one
how many immigrants were involved in Jan. 6?
What did you do for 4 years 😅😅😅😅😅😂😂
She has to be from another planet! Where does she get that crap?
Still hasn't given straight answer
Thank you, Bret for asking her questions to hold her accountable. She proved she will not take responsibility.
10 minutes in and she's danced around every question so far lol
She won't answer the fu:#3+ questions.. wow ?? 🤯
He asked real questions. Object journalism. Refreshing
How can she have become DA when she didn't pass the bar exam??
Can she answer a single question please?
Trump was only in office 4 years, why go back to ten years?
The past decade? Dems have been in power 12 out of the past 16 years
That joe biden question really messed her up 😂😂😂😂
Brett Bair did a great job! 👏🏻👍🏻 Real questions!  Brett was prepared. 👊🏻
Is she wearing the same earrings that will broadcast answers to her?
IS SHE LIKE A CAR SALES PERSON. LET ME KNOW.❤
Kamala just filibuster’s her questions & don’t answer them.
Why did Bret not question her blatant plagiarism?
She rambled and didn't answer the question about the border!! Someone pass the vinaigrette! 🥬🧅🥕
She wears the exact same earrings all the time. Someone perhaps whispering in her ear? Huh?
Turn the page? Dems have been President for 12 of the last 16 years. 25% of that time had Comma-la in the white house.
She literally can’t answer a single question. Jesus Christ
Why does she think she is in a debate.  This is a simple, i ask a question, u give an answer....maybe because she really doesnt have ANY answers!
Word salad Kamala dodges the very first question!! That's right.  Deflect and be evasive.
What are those new ideas??
She deflected every critical question and never gave a definitive answer to any question. She demanded not to be interrupted yet interrupted Brett constantly.
WHAT THE FUK is the plan!?! It's a simple question. Every non relevant person seems to know of this "plan".  Again what the FUK is the plan!!!???!!!
Not a single substantive answer; America is finished if she gets in.
Now the Democrats know what it feels like to be grilled and talked over like they did to Trump
Burdened by rhetoric? Does she really believes what she’s saying?
She's a professional side-stepper....never answers the question
The next interviewer need to ask different questions that have NEVER been aaked before.
She refuses to answer his question.
What's your policies mam? Answer;  Goto my website and read my 80 pages and interpret them how you see fit. I don't have time to explain my positions. 🤣🤣🤣
Is this just a Trump bashing interview?
boy oh boy you ask this Gal a question she doesn't like or isn't swayed in her direction & boy do we see someone get mad as heck. She was steaming. Her crew couldn't get her off that stage fast enough. We learned all we needed to learn watching this.
Can she actually answer a question that is asked? Dip n' dodge...  geez...
She's so rude. And of course did NOT answer the question all the while shifting blame on Trump. Lord have mercy on her lying soul.
For God's sake answer at least one Question!😂😂😂
When will Trump go on MSNBC? Or is he too afraid? Many of the liberal outlets have invited him but he turned them down because he is a weak coward. He had an interview scheduled with CNBC and turned it down last minute this week.
Joe Biden the experiment 🥼 😢 wondering when the slip was coming
So is it 1 or 3 or 6 million...
I wish she could just answer one question with an answer that has to do with the question.
If shes so sorry THEN WHY DIDNT SHE DO ANYTHING STILL?
Brett your questions were good, but she refused to answer all of them and you let her get away with it!!  The Queen of Baffling people with BS!
Bret is a terrible interviewer! Let her finish and answer the question. She is the leader we need to take us FORWARD. Never going back! 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Oh she got COOKED....she's not used to softball questions! Good job Fox and Bret !
Kamala are you on your period or your on birth control??
Thank you Fox News for good questions. Kamala responds like she’s being attacked personally. She’s running for president, she’s suppose to be ready to answer any type of question, no question is a tough question when you’re in this position to run a whole country.
God I can’t stand this woman, if she would just answer one question directly!! But she cannot!
He is rude, if you ask a question allow a n answer.   If you invite someone over just to hear yourself speak. Kiss off
Why is it so hard for her to apologize?
She is absolutely grotesque for avoiding the questions! 🤬 and loves to run out the clock with her word fillers that says nothing.  I don’t want to go to some website to read what somebody wrote for her as to what they say her policies are… and that she will follow the BS laws that she helps create.
Lol she tried to make the whole interview that first question
she doesn't go anywhere without those earrings does she?
She is rude and won't answer the question.  She is aggressive and angry.  Does her earrings not work tonight?
Is she brain dead ? She never answers questions ! 😂
Is she reading a teleprompter again??
When is someone going to scramble her pearl earring Bluetooth speakers?
WHEN WILL SOMEONE CALL HER OUT ON ALL THE LIES?????? WHEN!!!!!!!!!!! HE WAS TOO NICE
If USA does not have  a  way  to obtain background information to those illegal migrant, how Harris ‘ catch and release’ policy can keep criminals out of our country even she has more judges and patrols?
Trump had the lowest illegal border crossings in 45 years what changed duuuuuu
The question I want asked: Oh Joe Biden is sharp is he? Joe Biden won the Democratic primary. So why are you here?
Way to go Brett! Thank you for being honest and asking real questions.
It would be nice if she could answer at least one question.
Is this an interview? This is a butcher job. This guy has no interest in any actual interview. I guess they told him try you best to confuse her and make her look as bad as you can. It's a shame..the tactics they have to pull out..
Ask her what the law in her interpretation is.
Is this the face of the new generation  leadership ?I just don't know what you talking about.
Answer the question woman.
whats the matter Kackles your getting very loud and angry???? lmao
this hostor is great, ask straigt question, and keep request the straight answer
She cannot even answer a question.
This women will not answer a simple question with a simple answer. Every thing according to Kamala, it’s Donald Trump‘s fault.
Was that water in that glass ??? 🤣😂🤣
Well done Bret!! Finally, actual questions we want answered!
God he went on and on about questions which is what he does she shut him down yes ma'am
How many times did she say "Trump" during the interview?
For the love of God, woman - Answer an actual question!
American people want a president that can answer freaking question
What about the white immigration oppression? When Italians, German, Scotish, Irish, and other from the "Eastern" made their way to our shore and were greeted with slurs LIKE: WOP (With Out Papers) Daigo, Ginny, Kraut, potato, Mick, and the other creative names.
Did she not live her High School years in Canada and then not even register to be an American voter until her late 20’s almost 30 ?
She's taking a loooong time to answer questions and she is very vague, not answering direct questions
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOT ANSWERING!!!!
And the DNC thought this would win her votes??? Wow.
That was painful, WHY DOES SHE TALK?
The point is that you never answer the question!!!!
She going to bring her life experiences????  I don't want to have to learn to give head to move up in the world!!!!!!
Why was she late to the interview if not to milk the time knowing she will be grilled with tough questions.
Never answering the real question
How can fox do this? Isn't it just... entertainment? Oh right, it is!
5 minutes in...is this gonna be all 'gotch questions'? Perdue Pharma put opioids in the hands of millions of Americans AND millions DIED and none of those rich people are in prison but their skin isn't brown, it's white...lily white.
Don't you answer the question you're not answering the questions none of them,
He grilled her. She hasn't answered anything.
Lie, lie lie dose she even know what the truth is?
What about the black people that don’t have internet and don’t know how to use it? How can they see your policy? Considering they’re apparently too slow to get ID for voting.
He asked good questions but was overwhelmed by her refusal to answer them. She controlled the interview simply by over speaking him.
Go get her Brett. Right out of the gate, she can't answer a single question.
you've been to Europe also right? 😊
IM exhausted all you do is answer a question by slamming trump
Turn the page on divisiveness??  😂😂😂 you all wrote the book on divisiveness!!!  Typical Marxist!
Turn the page on divisiveness??  😂😂😂 you all wrote the book on divisiveness!!!  Typical Marxist!
Why does Brett ask questions if he doesn’t want to hear the answer or just keeps interrupting while she’s answering?!? They’re all Trump’s minions lol
Answer the question… you know you did nothing
Did her nose just grow a little longer??
Wow!  He’s grilling her but she just won’t come clean.
Why can’t she just answer the question????
As an interviewer, when you ask a question, you should shut your mouth and let the person answer.
She's dancing around the questions... AS ALWAYS!!!!
Wait, so 6 democrats actually killed this "border bill" but she continues to blame Trump? She lies and plays blame games so much. Bringing up the debunked suckers and losers. 🙄 She's clueless!
So many words, so little answers answered. If this was High School, I would get an F on my thesis paragraph for not answering question.
So what’s your plan ? Still no answers
how do you shake your head no while saying sincerely?
Who did the border patrol union endorse?
Answer the question!
Why is she giving so much money to Iran.
How the f*ck was she prosecutor?
Kamala, welcome to Fox News, which actually asks thoughtful and meaningful questions and holds you accountable!
How the heck is letting millions of people, who knows what background they have! Fixing the border?
Why did she start panicking when the topic of Iran, oil and enrichment were brought up?
She's not finished not answering the question
She cannot answer a question   What a moron
Guess dodging questions is doable when you’re going to cheat again.
Who would vote for her?? What a mess she is.
Does she only own 1 pair of earrings? Only ever seen her wearing the "Tiffany Pearl Earrings". I dont know a single women that would wear the same pair 2 days in a row let alone only a single pair always, unless thay are actually ear phones.
Her new nickname should be crash through Kamala , just keep Shoving don’t answer a question
There's a difference between responding and answering the question. She answered zero questions.
Who is currently vice president Kamala?
Lying an refusal to answer the question.
If you invite someone to an interview why not allow them to speak? You asking questions and not giving the interviewee the respect to respond.
Is she forgetting what happened with the Afghanistan withdrawal
She was down at the border talking to border agents? You mean the same border agents whose union backed Donald Trump? Lol😂😂😂 meanwhile it was the IRS the backed her how communistic can we get?
Every question she diverts answering and goes off on an uncontrollable rant  to bash Trump
Simple question, simple answers.  one word. numbers
Harris is so clueless. She couldn't even comprehend the question relating to the biggest global threat to the USA & waffles on again about blaming Trump.
If she can't handle a single reporter, how will she fare in arguments with Presidents Xi and Putin?
This guy is a joke.....anyone with discernment can see through this clown and his baited questions. 😂😂😂
How many people did Donald trump use on the US citizens from 2016 to 2020?... 0... why is the opposite what the leftists believe? They are a danger to truth.
Didn't the DOD just change their ability to use lethal force on citizens,?
What is she today Indian black Jamaican?
Destroyed on the first question. Unbelievable.
Too bad he can't act on a Trump, though. Question why he made those people starting to capital? Why is he still talking to Putin? He won't ask Trump that. Yeah, fox probably got the news.
Por Brett no matter how he tried he never got a single question answered  That’s the issue in this election   A lying deflecting evasive dolt
she has a LOT of solutions but why she haven't done it?
Hey Bret, would you and your colleagues like to apologise to the American people for deliberately spreading misinformation and defamatory remarks resulting in a $787 million defamation lawsuit against FOX "News"??  The biggest defamation lawsuit in US history, with more to come, btw.
Is delusion an art form now?
Not a single answer of substance
There’s so much that wasn’t covered, but it’s good to see her asked tougher questions, even though she couldn’t answer them
Is this the full interview?
She stonewalls every question eating up time just to get through.
VP Kamala not answering the question. Trying to deter conversation just to say she’s been doing a good job.  What a joke.
I hope my vote for Trump will be counted, as when I voted in 2020, I got a notification that it was not counted because of signature.  Well, it counted when I voted in all elections in Washington State all other times.
Why do you have the greatest turnover of staff then any Vice President has ever had?
I guess the Horrible EX CIA cheif had a how to avoid  the question school with this idiot!!
i think she didnt answer one single question
Masterclass in avoiding difficult questions by attacking her opponent consistently.  Not my way of doing things but its better than ‘the weave’ 😂
Who has she lifted up as a president?
She never answers a question. She defuses. We want answers!
Come on, guy, get the grip back on the. Reins, here she's controlling you, and she's taken it away from completely from what you're asking her about changing the subject so she can get out of the question.
I watched the first 58 seconds ~ and ~ God help us all !!!  Why can't she just answer his question PERIOD.
Right out of the gate ... she won't answer the question. She's a condescending snot.
Boarder secutity bill was 9 months ago but what happened for the first 3 years? How maney illeagls entered in the US for the first 3 years? Why they were waiting until 9 months ago! oh, i get it, because the elections and they want it to saw you how GOOD they are....
“When did you first notice Joe Biden’s faculties appeared diminished?”  Excellent question, useless answer.
She can't answer the question
Anyone else notice she wore the same pearl “earrings” on all 4 interviews?
Well done Bret! Was pleasantly surprised by the hard hitting questions. It's rare for journalists to hold politicians accountable.
The first question was so stupid because millions of people came in illegally under Trump, even
9:45 you havent decriminalized border crossings? Cause from what i can see the past 4 years its completely legal to cross the border. No reprocussions in fact you made an app to make it easier!
Not a very good interviewer. I was a journalist, you ask a question and wait for an answer. GEEZ.
Don't you have to run on a problem to fix a problem. Kamala Harris is one of the biggest problems.
How many times did she say Donald Trump?
If they fixed the border why 20,000,000 illegal immigrant got in in USA in 3.5 years only.
WHO IS THE MEDIA???????    FOXNews the spin network???  The problem today is there are 1000's of media sources...and the public doesn't know what to believe...Sensationalism (especially in journalism) the use of exciting or shocking stories or language at the expense of accuracy, in order to provoke public interest or excitement, ratings and money…well done FOX Fools! YOU make the money and LIKES… Maybe it pays for the 787 million dollars for lying to there viewers...who do you believe?
Just dodging all the questions and looks like she's about to blow a fuse. No clear answers to any of the questions, just rambling on and on about nothing.
Finally!!! Someone ask real questions!! Glad to see Fox step it up on these clowns 🤡
I want to know where the money is coming from to pay for this free money for housing, business.?
What about all your staffers who quit, and quit,  and quit,  ma'am? 22:27
Let’s get to the point at not answering the question.😅😂
Answer the question!!!!!!
When questioned about her time in power, actions and inaction she's always flips everything back about Trump.   She cannot have the focus be about her time in office.
Why is she yelling?
It's always a non answer from her 😂
She won't answer the question
can someone please tell me how any AMERICAN can vote for that pathetic person who puts the illegal immigrants before us????
How could anyone with a brain vote for her
Joe Biden has talked about enemy within since day one!! Kamala, why is it okay for Dems to talk about the enemy within but not Republicans??
Did she even prep for this interview?
Dear God can she even hear herself
He doesn't let her finish answering his questions. Fox LOVES to ask a question and then not let you ANSWER it. Such a pathetic network.
Bret dud a good job. Kamala kept interrupting and talking over him AND never ANSWER the question!
Ask yourself how would Trump handle the Israel, Hamas and hezbola conflict?  How would he deal with Russia and Ukraine?  Think about that exactly what would Trump do and how would he deal with NATO and the World Health Organization!  People really need to think outside all the BS rhetoric and what what’s really gonna happen if Trump gets in the office just think about what the hell is he going to do?
This lady literally cannot even respond to a simple question.
was it just me or was she about to cry when posed with the first question. I heard her voice break and was waiting on the waterworks. hilarious...
Does she not realize she is the evil within?
Wow who is the one who is really unhinged
This is a bad interview by Fox red Bret Beier keeps interrupting without her answering the question
Bravo Brett, you actually asked her questions and demanded real answers.
Ya what is that plan
She never answers the question, NEVER
Why wasn't she laughing a lot
She talks over the questions, so this is just about holding forth, not about listening and answering concisely.
She literally milked the one question about the border number! Brett should’ve told her… stop there, I just want a number not a long winded fictional story.
This interview is more like DEBATE questions BUT trump is missing from this debate. Where’s trump?
@0:50 right off the start she is already refusing to answer the question, wow, amazing.......... further more @15:10 from the sound of it, she doesn't know WHAT she will do differently, and just more word salad
Give us a NUMBER!!!!😴💤
Did she loose her temper?
What kind of women have you ever met who wears the same ear rings all the time.
They supported the guy that killed the border bill & never actually offered a bill when he was the President ?????
You have never answered a question!!!
This vile horror of a woman is such a nightmare, can’t even answer a single question honestly. She’s a demon.
Has Brett been arrested yet? He just killed and buried her on national television
Will trump go on MSNBC for an interview....asking the MAGA minions out there 🤷🏾‍♂️.
How many times did she mention trump ?
She should only get 30 seconds to  andwer a 5 second question
Kamala why can't you tell the truth or why can't you fix what you can't because Obama would put you to the curbside
It's about time someone asked her some REAL questions for a change. Thank you Brett!
So frustrating she will not answer a question . Fullof sh.
She never answers and a single question fully.
What exactly is your plan?
Just answer the questions FFS!
How many times did she say Donald Trump? 🙄 🤮
Thanks for making her answer questions
WTH was that? She never answered anything clearly.
She’s losing it.. first time someone actually questioned her!
If she dont peomote her plans he leeps aaking questions about Bidens administration.
Scamala got grilled finally lol
Talking about apology what about Jan 6 should I keep going.  Like stop this stupid division stuff smh. America look like clowns!!
When's Trump going on MSNBC? When will he release his health records? Income taxes? ANY policies?
Does she not know they’ve been trying to lock him up for 4 years now, give me a break
Are these really Bots? Or are people paid to comment here? It is mind blowing.
Hmmm Congress has a role in law making?  WOW! 🍻
Why in the heck not let her talk? Why overtalk her and interrupt?
Why isn’t the quest how do you justify ripping up the remain in Mexico policy?
She NEVERRRRRRRRR answers a question directly!   She babbles and dodges the question with her absolute BS!  🙄🤦🏻‍♀️.  ANSWER THE QUESTIONS!!  🤡
How is using TAX PAYER’s money for funding prison surgeries not a concern for a voter.
She got stumped by the Joe Biden question
Did she suck helium at some point during this interview??? 😂😂😂
She was completely worn out by having ACTUAL questions 😂
If Kamala can fix it, why is it still broken nearly four years after she took office?
Bret was just looking to misframe issues with simplistic and reductive questions. He was looking for soundbytes. That's why he tried to shut down any meaningful reply or any context provided. His tactic works on morons, though, so sure Fox viewers will see it as a win.
I don't like how he question Kamala. They ask her a question, she answers, but then he tries to interrupt her as she gives an explanation to her answer...
Finally real questions
What do we say when Dear Leader shits himself? Thank you sir may we please have another! We are maggots !
Ask Mr Brown’s wife if you are fit to serve
Serious question for you Trump supporters: What is it that you like about Trump?
She doesn't know when to shut up. She looks like a complete idiot refusing to answer question by talking over him when everyone already knows the answer she just refuses to say it.
Good for him for stopping her from avoiding questions!
Funny she always wears the same ear rings during interviews.  Hmmmmmm
Ask her about flying them in i pray
The last decade  2 years of Obama  4 years of Trump  4 years of Biden  Hmmmmmmmmm 6 years of Democrats 4 years Trump
The answer to the first question is more than 7.2 million migrants have illegally crossed into the U.S. over the Southwest border alone. If you add the northern border and other points of entry, the number is at least 10 million.
I have to admit, although I cant stand the woman, she sure does know how to dodge a question and even with a good journalist like Bret.
He asked for numbers no for beer 🍺
Why is she allowed to speak lies?
This lying witch is not answering direct questions!
What are you turning the page from??? 😂😂😂
I applaud Bret for his ability not to be rude to a candidate who is not answering his questions. Who deflects at every chance.
Why is it only France and the United States have broken immigration systems 🤔
Why was it only 27 min? I was enjoying the smell of grilled Kamala.
Answer the Question … Stop Blaming Trump…
instead of talking about Trump, answer the questions directly!
Once again answer the question Kamala
Then why are you paying them to be here? Ask that question Brett
Refusal to answer question asked
How many times does she have to look to the sidelines for some one to call a *time out* ?
So do she take accountability for anything or is everything Donald trump fault
What a joke she is!!!! She has not a clue!! Point is he asked a question!!!!!
still unclear what she would do as president. decent interview, but not much in the way of answers.
DJT wouldn’t be able to answer these questions.
Really answer the questions
She could not answer a single question and her handlers had to throw  the towel.
Just answer the question. It was your administration that opened the boarder. You should be accountable for what you did.
I always thought Brett was a snake, but I must give him a thumb up this time for asking tough questions.
no mention of trump routinely shitting himself?
Nice over talk her Geeze how can she answer a question?
How's she going to pay for her plans. Dig deep guys
She cant answer a simple question. Not need her as a president. Still dont know anything about the furture. Passing the buck. Yes, Trump for president.
Answer a question? The queen of deflection
Why would anyone vote for her? Talk to her about the millions of lazy criminal Venezuelans that she and Biden have let in .
WHY DOES SHE TALK?
@00:36 wow.. she immediately starts filibustering, he attempts to REDIRECT her then SHE blames HIM for interrupting…?
Does this cow ever take those pearl earrings off or are they microphones?
Answer the question Kamala
Turn the page on rhetoric? This country is in shambles, and that's the only thing she can pledge to turn the page on. Wild!
This is a masterclass on how you answer a question you don’t want to answer and how not to give the correct answer
They rigged Kamala in as they do in elections but they don't know as she comes so will she go.😂😢😢
Just answer the question.  Gosh, she makes me wanna puke.  Lord Jesus, unburden us from this Clown Show!
Why didn't Trump fix the country when he was president? I'm still waiting on his healthcare plan he promised.
Breat B probably gave her the question before hand
IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE: Answer one single question without saying Donald Trump
Why won't she answer a simple question rather that diverting and lying.
First question and she couldn’t answer 😂
U never go to the point u word salad everything...just answer the question...vote no on her!!
i wish someone would just repeat the same question over and over until she actually answered it.
4:00 that happened in 2023, but the question was about what happened in 2020
I have never seen a person not once answer one question just bs word salad
Did Trump get Mexico to pay for the WALL?
That doesn't answer  why your administration  opened the border wide open in 2021
Answer the question you've been in power bwitch
Too many nasty questions
Answer the questions dumbass
She just kept rambling on , now who saw that only one of her ears was uncovered Hum , was she wearing an ear piece in again? Think 🤔
Does she actually ever answer a question?
She can't answer a question because she knows it will ruin her!
Are her magic earrings not working tonight?
Wait She's trying to listen through her earrings
Does she actually think shes comes off looking good in this?
Baier: "What would you do differently than Biden?"
Baier: "How will you fix the Israel and Palestinian crisis?"
So, Ma'am, why is the border still a major, perhaps number one, problem?
What the hell is wrong with her!!!!!????
If This Were a boxing match comma low would have got knocked out TKO on the first swing the first question Harris blew it from there downhill not able to answer one question or just spew a bunch of Lies
Codeword: 😮"let me finish!" She isn't going to answer anything you just asked!
Anyone notice she is wearing the same earrings………..lol
Kamala do you recall Kate Steinly?
Kamala...can't answer the questions!  She must have mud on her face everyday if she didn't see Joe's mental decline!
She can’t answer the question!!
Was it only 27 minutes?   Or is there a full interview somewhere.. Thanks
If the immigration system was broken, why wasn't there an invasion until after they arrived at the White House?
Just an added thought, Thank You Brett for actual questions and re affirming responses from our current VO, she has been and is USELESS to the American People.
Democracy??? América is run by military complex and it's puppets biden adm and democratic party and kamala lets take our country from military complex and we the people are all voting for trump
She’s the border Zar!!!  She NEVER answers a question EVER
So how you can fix it???
Why is it that this crazy lady can't seem to answer one simple question? Is she mentally unstable or just ignorant? 😂😂😂😂😂
The usual, don't answer the actual question, deflect,  lie through your teeth  , and when all else fails  talk about President Trump. I hope her and Tampon Tim are never heard from again after the election.
Her refusal to answers to any of these questions is an embarrassment.
Ask her, what specifically is wrong with out current economy!!!
So then why did you agree with everything he did.
Has Fox redemption come?? Bret made a national stooge out of her..
Those same earrings as every interview 😂😂😂 Isn’t there any money left in the secret projects fund to make her a new pair of earphone earrings? Fk me ✋😂
Madam giggles proves once again that she cannot be trusted with even answering a question.
How many times did she mention Trump in this interview? She literally can't do an interview without mentioning him at least 15 times, its exhausting to hear...
The very first question she was asked and she got defensive. She cut him off before he was able to finish the question.
Straight forward question - “How many? “  Answer- “To the point” , but couldn’t give a number !
How many members of Kamala Harris's staff resigned from prestigious White House assignments working with her?
An interviewer that finally asked the questions I’m interested in…she didn’t answer them truthfully but the questions were asked.
Theres republicans supporting her? Lol
This is appalling.  Kamala insists on relying on her traditional tactic of responding by talking about something else, going off on word salads, blathering but not answering the question.  To be fair, many, many liberals and left wingers use the same tactic of not replying to a question but talking about something else.
Wow, Kamala literally can not answer a single question.
Kamala...did Doughie sleep with the nanny? Did he also slap the nanny?
Can you not answer a straight question?
How terrible... It's like every answer she gave? Had that upward lilt of questioning? Like she wasn't sure of her words? That's a linguistic tell? Of a person looking for validation of their words?  Good job Brett. You must be exhausted from watching her dance around all your questions.
And why do you keep up bringing Trump in y’all been in charge this whole time you don’t have any authority
You really want this salty woman for the president?
And why do you keep up bringing Trump in y’all been in charge this whole time you don’t have any authority
She did not answer a single question. Baer did a sh*t job of holding her to answering.
He's knocking but nobody is home
She sounds like somebody asked my mother-in-law a technical question about V8 engines.
She’s wasting time and not answering the questions.
So Kamala…. no apology to the families?   Wow.
Her comprehension to questions asked are more disturbing than her LIES 😮
So are all her policies for black men only according to her promises to the black men voters? She is more rhetoric left Democratic policies and  inexperienced fake person. She too will be a puppet and Obama will be her puppeteer!
What if Kamala is only fed ai videos of Trump and actually believes herself 😂
Is she wearing the same ears that she had worn at the debate? Just asking
Finally someone asking questions everyone wants to know.
did she answer one question ?
So she spending millions of tax dollars so others may have a house. What about us with a house that needs home repairs and maintenance updates?! When do we get $25,OOO???
How exactly is the border broke, if you don't follow the law?
Very nice interview, first time she really gets some questions, 60 minutes was manipulated with so even if the journalist tried many was not allowed to se her unedited
21:03  absolutely love this question...if trump is unfit then Biden is what?!
Anyone know if this was "doctored"? I didn't get a chance to see this live.
Why's she raising her voice?
Is there someone more stupid and incompetent than she is?!
How many illegal immigrants would you estimate that your administration released into the country over the last three years!
Why can’t she not grasp the reality of her horrible actions?
She is her own October surprise 😂 she looks so stupid just trying to answer normal questions
Pathetic, pitiful and disdainful. She and Mayorkas are quite the pair. Neither one will answer any question truthfully, without word salads.
INTELLIGENT follow  up  questions  this is true journalism .
Answer the questions!
Which earrings is she wearing during this "interview"??
26 minute interview?
What's your plan what's your plan
DJT is not in office!!!! Why does she keep saying his name?!?!
Let her friggen answer the question.  Does he want to ask questions or just do a monologue?
I’m cheering! Finally this idiot gets pressed on real questions. Bravo Brett!
I appreciate what Bret did here, but I don't understand why he didn't call out her blatant lies about President Trump supposedly wanting to turn the military on American citizens and so forth? All of that was a blatant lie and he didn't call it out.
She’s yelling… near the end… not a good look… not presidential. Too emotional.. and then hahaha he’s not stable and then the biden question and she stopped in her tracks.
Why she is wearing the same ear ring every time she had real interview??
She's amazing! Where have they been hiding her? I may just change my vote.
Wild how she is completely programmed into not answering questions. I don’t even think she notices. Scary.
Why isn’t this live???
Finally a real interview what world questions not softball 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾
Big entitled baby finally faced the real journalist and the real questions. Poor thing!
So let me show empathy, because I'm not going to answer your question!!
She can't answer a single question. When was border concern? No answer, right into sales and fingerpoint
Lol they do the same to jd vance by interrupting now all of a sudden fox does it its a problem?
Why doesn't Brett SHUT UP! He's talking OVER HER every minute.
Wow...is this episode of Punk'd? This can't be real nominee for the President of the USA ..
My question: if you aren't a first time home buyer, a new parent or starting a small business how will she plan to help us with the high prices (and don't give me price gouging... we know that is not having on a large scale yet prices are high due to Biden/Harris energy and spending policies).
Great questions by Brett Bear!
Brett, why you  didn’t tell her to stop lying and talking about Trump, when you are asking about her policies?? Also, why couldn’t you ask her to be more respectful to you!!?? Who is going to tell her that people don’t like her because of her attitude and theatrical style!!
They need more judges to process them, why can't they do it in mexico not here?
Does she own any other earings??
Why did she get soo angry? what a bad look
You American's seriously considering this 'word salad' mess as a President? Ahahaha!
Why if she’s so concerned about Iran are the insisting Israel’s support be minimal and they’re to be the peacekeepers when in fact they’re still under constant attack???
Harris can't even make a policy decision on this question when asked on the phone.  " press 1 for English, press 2 for Spanish " "JOY" Doesn't pay the bills.
Good question Brett about if he’s so bad why 50% support
Still waiting for her to answer a question. 😂😂
Great job, Bret, for holding her feet to the fire and asking questions we the people want to know! All I heard was deflection from her.
LIE AFTER LIE AFTER LIE!!! THIS THING HAS YET TO GIVE A HONEST ANSWER TO A QUESTION YET!! FROM ANYONE! AMAZING!! I don't believe for a second that this race is almost a tie. She is a BRAINLESS TWIT!! WOW! just WOW!
Why was she in the situation room?
Answer the damm questions
Why do an interview on a Network that paid $800 million lawsuit for lying about an election? Their viewership are in a cult.
Where have those fresh new ideas been over the last four years?
Brett ought to have asked her to define "woman".
Have any of you watch the trump bloomberg interview, or are you just blind to what you don’t want to see???
About time she got real questions
This woman is UNELECTABLE.  Never answers a single question.  Always diverts to her script which avoids an answer.
She is so stupid, can't even handle a simple interview
Always Trump's fault, never answering a question directly.
Did she even answer one question he asked?
Instead of saying what she going to do she’s telling us what Trump is going to do you need to tell us are you for something or against it instead I’m gonna follow the law that’s not an answer
Is that person supposed to protect the American population from an invasion or a war????? She'll lie and lie and lie .
Why so hostile?what happened to the joy 😂😂😂😂😂
Every single question he asked, she never even attempted to answer the question. She answered entirely different questions, but never the one asked.
Who is locking people up!?!?!?
All hes asking is about opinions and feelings.
She is clearly SO not used to being pressed to give answers to moderately hard hitting questions. She just keeps repeating her bumper sticker slogans… “my experiences”, “lifting people up” shut up!
He asked her about Joe Bidens mental decline, and she goes on a tangent about Trump.
Ans the fk question bit, she thinnk American r stupid . Kalama you r fk stupid
Still cant answer simple questions and completely ruined the border.   She is ablaten liar
Is it just me, or does she seem to be wearing the same pair of earrings at every interviews just as she was waering at the presidential debate? I notice that she wore some other pair at her rally since she's reading off of s teleprompter
does NOT answer the question
its like Brett asked her a question and when she's answering he just interrupts her and tries to switch topics lol like you wanted to go down this rabbit hole Brett
Seems like the talking point here is every time you get asked a question. Turn it around on Trump and talk about him.
How can she be so stupid??? Is this for real??
she has no answers because she refuses to admit any mistakes and only knows how to deflect responsibilities to someone whos not in office.
Are we this stupid to not believe that these people intentionally planned to allow this illegal invasion of this Country. And used the resources of the Country to feed, house and clothe them.
Does Bret Baier's obvious face-lift surgery count as gender reassignment? That's not very manly.
Painful to see someone holding her current role actually physically unable to answer direct questions. Can’t wait until she’s far away from this office in a few months.
Play Biden's Philadelphia speech.Ask her about that.
Scottish person here in Scotland... Honestly question with love ❤. Do you realise you 'maga ' are in the cult
Why doesn’t he get his respect and be called President Trump like they do everyone else
When has fox ever questioned trump like Baer is questioning Harris?

She's a liar. Grill her good because she's not answering the question,,,"WE"are not the ones doing the talking,,this ain't about Biden now. Good grief she's terrible. Get her out of here.
She still can’t answer questions.  Still can’t admit any wrongs.  These interviews should limit the responses to 10 words or less.
Remind me again who eliminated isis😮
So is Donald trump running the current administration?? What’s with her blaming Donald Trump for everything, there’s almost 4yrs between Trumps administration and now, what that means is that nothing has absolutely been done in the almost 4yrs that she and Joe Biden have been in office.
She can't answer a question. Absolutely embarrassing candidate. Deflection and finger-pointing are not answers. There's zero accountability from all the damage this administration has done.
She will follow the law?? When? We have border laws that are still in place and they are NOT being followed by this current administration and that includes her. She went on The View last week and said she wouldn't change anything she and Biden have done since taking office. How anyone could even think of voting for this continued failure is beyond me.
shes the worst human to ever run for president hands down,, unable to even answer the question.  has to diffuse, lie, and dissuade just to even TRY and prove her point
Soo… if Kamala couldn’t do anything as border zar, and will not change anything… is that not a zero solution?
Do democrats really think 4yrs of Kamala leadership will make things better? Give me some pepto-bismol pls.😅
Did she just plagiarize Joe Biden on her tax plan with 13 scholar......s
Answer the questions
How about the Venezuelan gang’s
She cant answer any question
How in the hell are they asking her if she has remorse!!! WHEN will trump admit he botched the covid response and 1 MILLION Americans died!
Soo… if Kamala couldn’t do anything as border zar, and will not change anything… is that not a zero solution?
More Xanax then Policy ? My Head Hurts .......
The filthy lefty commies just never seem to be able to answer questions
That lady is a clown she won't even answer a question straight forward ever
This woman should actually be a case study   Why can’t she answer the question?  It’s annoying
Madam vice president can I check your earrings should’ve been the last question I swear I’m so sick of her and her handlers crap
She broke the border,full Stop she can't answer the question!
@13:20 so when did the president's phrasing of his or her plans go from   ( I & My ) to now  (Our & We) who's actually making the decisions Kamala , we all know you have no idea how to spot a good plan vs. a bad plan  ... On any subject.
Dumb is still Dumb no matter how try to avoid answering the question with your Bullsh-t blabbering about nothing.  Idiots are born every day!  When was she?
If her policy is so good, why it didn’t work for past 3 years ?
Can she speak like a regular person
Did she answer one question in the interview?
She dosnt answer a question
Answer the questions and stop deflecting to it's all Trumps fault. Stop making it an argument. She is not use to handling hard questions that come with follow ups.
You see her stumped when he asked when she knew Biden was brain dead 😅
Love your questions Brett!!  And you patience !  Kamala is just not a true Patriot to our country.  She has the attitude of a selfless enemy towards our country🤬
Do you really think having 15 more agents can handle 3M people coming in illegally?
why during every sit down interview is she wearing the same pair of earrings?
What was her conviction rate?
Classless interview tactics from Brett.
Is she gonna answer any of the questions?
She answered nothing lol
I want to know who is talking in her ear??
The real question here is, "Why didn't you leave in place executive orders that stabilized the border during Trump's administration instead of breaking the border first first and then debating the bill?
What are you talking about 😂😂😂
She has no answers!
Look at her attitide from a dimple hard question. Unstable
Is it just me or did the interview seem very short? Clear that Kamala's people were trying to cut as soon as she got flustered over lying about Biden's decline
Bad move to take  on this interview bad move.
He didn’t attack her. All he did was ask questions and pushed for the truth. Well done!   Checkmate 🇺🇸
How many times did she say “Donald Trump”? Jeez
Is this a spoof???
Shouting while not even understanding the question. Classic.
She had no response to the question of having been in the office for 3.5 yrs already. Lol
Finally, the questions she needed to hear.
Think she'll still go on Joe Rogan? 😂😂😂
Where are all those checks for those that were devastated in the hurricanes...Ohhh...that's right, other countries got that money...
Finally she gets asked the basic questions!
Omg she DIDNT answer the 1st question which was how many illegal immigrants came in. She went full on word salad BUT refused to answer his questions, all she did was blame Trump , mumble and jumble. I'm impressed by Brett! He stood up to her !!!
I just wished she would answer the question so we could know what she perceived  the question was..
She sounds like an absolute idiot. How is it that at this point of her campaign she STILL sounds like that one hungover dude in class who forgot he had an oral report due that day?!
She’s not answering the questions directly instead she goes around in circles! It’s crazy and insane 😂😂
She never answers a question
Kabala represents the new generation of the Kommunist Party. Right Komrade Kabala?
So when was she lying  now or before she changed so much she got me confused shaky what she stands for except she was a kid and from what I've heard that a little
Anyone notice the earrings?
So how is this incompetent 5'4 woman, supposed to deal with Putin and Kim Jung. These guys have out lasted 5 US Presidents!
And she wants to get rid of the filibuster??? That is all she does is filibuster
Finally a real reporter with real questions and fact check . Congratulations 🎉🎊 Brett.
Note the same ear rings.  Does she only own one pair 🤔
Lol isn't she wearing those same earrings  from all the other interviews
Why even have her on ? if your not going to let her talk .
Why doesn’t she go back to office and sign a executive order to stop people from crossing
1st 2 questions in...hasn't answered either
This is supposed to be an interview? My man, I understand you probably interrupt your wife and her boyfriend, but let Kamala talk!
She avoids EVERY question! She’s so frustrating to listen to. A bag of hot air.
She's not answering any of the questions! She's tip-toeing around it Don't let her get away with it.
She can’t even answer the question
She’s been burdened by unscripted questions…😂😂😂
She's debating the interviewer.
Did you see the snarl?
How is she going to pay for this after her house plan bankrupt people
He was so rude with his questions just with the interest of getting her to trip but she handled it very well . Infact she should do another one by tomorrow and see if that will slide again .
She just wants to drag a question without answering and bret just thrashed her
Why cant she just answer a question
Why was Bret interrupting constantly?
Great job with questions and follow up …. She refused to answer your first question and shame on her …. She had 3-1/2 years to fix and Obama had 8 years to fix it plus they had Democratic Congress first term each time …. Shame on her and the democrats
she don't know how to answer the question
Has she ever answered a question?
It pains me to watch this liar! Kamala Harris can not answer any question honestly!
That's a good question why is people supporting a man that lead attack the Congress on Jan 6 Why
Answer the questions.
All she is doing is deflecting to Trump instead of answering a single question.
Ask her why she didn’t try to fix immigration at the beginning when they first saw that the open boarder was not working
No accountability. Turn what page? She has been in office for 3 and a half years
You could ask 100 economists to predict the economy and you’ll get 100 different answers.
The questions was does she regret making that decision. She never said she regrets.
She can’t even answer a yes or no question
Why are you being so rude madame VP? You surely aren't talking down and acting defensive during an interview holding you accountable for your administration? Sure isn't looking good for you.
Finally, real questions!
Did this woman leave this interview by flying away on a broom?
Is it not ride that he addresses her per madam President and she in turn calls him by his first name. In Europe it is unthinkable
she was trying to filibuster him and he was not having it, just answer the questions directly please.
How many times did Trumps name come out of her mouth?
She doesn't answer the question. That says allot.
This talking Muppet needs to answer questions
He wouldn’t even let her finish answering the question he’s a very bad interviewer. I will never go to Fox News again. If I was her
Is it just me or is it very suspicious that every interview she is wearing these earrings?
She allowed it what is she talking about
Anwser the question she did not say sorry America is over if  she wins Trump 2024 let’s end this mess
Over five minutes in and she hasn't answered a single question.
The border bill they keep saying Trump stopped wasn't even introduced until Feb 2024. What is her excuse for the period of time from Jan 2021 to Feb 2024? While our border was wide open
Where are HER clips demonizing Trump….?
Is this the entire interview from beginning to end? I thought it was going to be 1 hour long without commercials?
She went around and around without answering the topic questions.
She skated around the border question.  This woman needs to take responsibility for her failed decisions!!
16:20 like how you reversed the question brett
Laughing cow 🐮 idiot.Get to the point,answer it,stop 💩and get away the question,how many millions ilegal coming this country killing our people.Stop lying 😡
By 1 minute in, she is evading an answer and dodging the question. So estranged from truth.  Marinated in B.S. and double speak. You have to let me fix the problem I created.
Why make the title of this video so complicated?
Why is she yelling?
Does harris even know she's been vice-president the last four years? It seems she doesn't.
I feel awful is not an apology and still no answer to the question.
We the People, the 100,000,000 dollar question is? Who do you want representing you in affordability,growth, prosperity, in the law, in wars, Internationally, in safety, against Communism and as an American Citizen!!! We don't know her because she has done nothing positive for WE the People!!! Trump or Kamala?? Choose intelligently God bless America, everyone & President Trump😊
Where the hell is her Latin accent??? I am so F'N burdened by this!!!
Are those the earrings?? 👀
Is this the whole interview?
She couldn't answer a question if her life depended on it...🙄
Why didn't Trump show up?
Anyone seen Ben Grimm and Bret baier in the same room?😂
What a waste of time watching this. She never gets to the point . she's a scramble head, all over the place, and never answers the question.  Im done ✔️
Wow- a journalist interviewing a candidate using follow-up questions. Fascinating
She's a terrible liar and again never answered a question.
When was she at border like three years later... LOL
🤦🏻‍♂️ what plans is she talking about? She speaks in completely empty broad strokes with no particulars. So utterly painful. She’s single handedly setting women back a generation.
Didn't answer a single question and kept babbling and talking down to bret. She is so rude.Jeez
Is she even capable of answering a question when asked?
She never answers the question!
Listening to her "attempt" to answer a simple question is very much like Chinese water torture!  It drives me insane!  And she ALWAYS blames Trump!  PATHETIC!!
The Tim waltz question caught her off guard.
She just refuses to answer the question.
A topic of discussion? Really?
He never allowed her to answer his questions without interrupting her.
Is this the full interview?
She can't answer 1 question😂
Hmmmm, I wonder why Trump didn’t need 1500 more border patrol agents to keep the immigration numbers low during his administration 🤔
God this woman can't answer a dam question!!
Is this what a bloodbath looks like? 🤣
Was Minneapolis a peaceful protest it could have been if waltz had called out the national guard to keep the piece instead of waiting for it to get unpeaceful
I bet she was great at hop scotch as a kid... skipping around all those questions....
First answer is full of word salad to distract from the question 🤦🏻‍♀️
The point was the question
Just answer the question without trying to speak to the interviewer as a child. Answer straight forward it's a yes or no question 🙄
This guy is interviewing the Vice President, and he's interrupting her 5 seconds into question 1. He needs to ask his question, shut up and listen, then ask the next one. This isn't some entertainer this is a person in a position demanding respect, and the interviewer is talking over her at every turn. Trump would not be treated this way
Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't it Obama that blamed Bush for everything and now Kamala is blaming Bush or Trump for everything sounds so familiar
How is she asked a question whose answer is a number (i.e., “how many”) and she answers with a word salad?! She answers not a single question. Shameful that anyone would elect her to any position. I know I didn’t.
Is this woman a capable of forming sentence that isn’t prescripted ???
😅😅😅 she doesn’t answer the question. She jumps to other subjects. Flip flops a lot.
All she did was deflect questions and go back to her script.
30 minutes of not answering questions
Turn the page? We are on your page Kamala. Yours and Bidens. Why should we follow you when you're SECOND in power? We dont need your pages.
DANCING BEAR KAMALA HOW COME A SCUMBAG DEMOCRAT CANT ANSWER A QUESTION😮
Where is the full interview at???
Bret was prosecuted by Kamala fir asking abnormal questions 😅
She doesn't answer questions,, she talks over Bret,, rude as hell,, and as always,,, not prepared... She has no control,,, it's the small committee behind the scene that allows her to run... puppet girl Kamalwalla ding dong.... No f'in way.
As usual, Harris just dodged the questions.
She CANNOT answer a question period!!! Everything is attacking trump, going off key..No solutions from her..She is a joke. Completely unhinged man wow!!!
He asked for a NUMBER, not a salad.
This lying, stinking, f***king b***h didn't answer 1 direct question.
Lol she's dodging questions like neo dodges bullets
Finally some serious questions, and boy is she mad😂😂😂 Devastating 👊🏼
How anybody can watch this and still vote for her is beyond me.
STILL NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION!!!  JC, what does she not understand!!!  And STOP saying “yes, ma’am”
Why was Diaper Don dancing???
Does it Even Matter Anymore?? She WILL NEVER ANSWER THE QUESTION TRUTHFULLY OR AT ALL!!
What is he doing he interrupted her answers
Hey he didn't let her answer that first question I thought he wanted her speak
Where’s the laughs and smiles? Not so confident now huh
She can't even answer a simple question
