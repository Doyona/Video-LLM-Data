I wonder how people who said they wouldn't watch American Idol this year because of Carrie  decided to come back home?
So was that a no?
Did she get through ???
That’s Carrie Underwood? 😮😮 she looks different
So, did they pass her through to Hollywood?
What? No performance review?
So did she make it through?
Teary eyed anyone?
Did she make the cut?
Did she make it through they didnt say
I couldn’t recognize Carrie… what happened to her face?
Why all commercials non-White??
Is this american idol or country idol
Gosh i thought wtf happened to katy Perry what kinda surgery she had
Am I the only one who feels the distress in watching a little boy so over-tired and needing to sleep that he can’t sit through one live song by his mom? Don’t know what time of day this interview was but the little boy needs a warm bed. He’s being a good kid by not making waves but it’s hard to watch him struggle to keep his eyes open.
Who’s crying with me 🥹❤️❤️
So did she get through ?  Wow that little man is so chilled
Did she go through????!!!! She was good!! I want to see more.
Why is it 2025 and the highest quality is 720p?
So what happened?? Is she going to Hollywood??
Did she make it or not?
Did the girl get to go on? I love this video!!
Whats wrong with Carries lips. Horrible
Great job, great song, great kid, great family (hubby on the keys). One question, Is she going to Hollywood?????
Has this episode aired yet??
