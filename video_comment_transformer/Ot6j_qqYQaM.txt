“Bring me to life trailer? That must be some thematic, orchestral track in the game. But man it would be amazing if it was actualOHMYGOD IT ACTUALLY IS!!!”

Hey, you're awake, you were having nightmares, are you okay? You were saying some strange things about existing in the future in 2025.
What's with the sudden surge of 2000s AMVs in 2025? First it's Devil May Cry in Netflix hiring Papa Roach, Limp Bizket, and Evanescence to the songs and now it's FromSoft's turn?   Please do these AMVs more
The hell is this trailer
First the rehearsal and now fromsoft??? BRING ME BACK TO LIFE

Am I the only one with a black video? I didn't got any image peak sound tho. Edit: Don't know what it was but on a replay I got image
And everyone is asking why they add pop songs for this game. They literally ruin it what made elden ring soundtrack so good.
guys why is this video is 240p i dont understand
Damn was "In The End" by Linkin Park not available? Maybe the next Elden Ring trailer will have Avril Lavigne in it.

Back to 2006 Fromsoftware?
WHAT TIMELINE ARE WE IN?!
who tf choose the song
Who else is here before this blows up
I thought that was midir at the last bit of the official trailer but now seeing this it looks like it's just a normal ancient Drake?
Using this song is just absurd. Is this satirical? 😂
Chat is this real?
Bro what year is it!!??
WTF is this
Devil may cry anime and now this what going on? I'm all for it tho
how many times you watched the trailer? yes.
Why are you pulling my 00s emo heartstrings you bastards
Did I enter a wormhole and end up back in 2007? This is like an Officially made, Big Budgeted AMV
Wait really?
Who else is here before this blows up
Who else is here before this blows up
I've watched this trailer 100 times already. How can I stop?
At 0:54 what character is that? I haven’t seen them
This feels like a fan amv. Is this real? Am I still awake?
If possible can we get an Executor trailer with either Monster by Skillet or Animal I Have Become by Three Days Grace? On that topic I wouldn't mind a Paralyzer trailer with Wylder or a Let The Bodies Hit The Floor trailer for Raider.
What's next? Courtesy call? Sorry but that's reserved for dragon ball game trailers
How much did my good ol bosses up there pay for this song's rights? You'll never know. Nor will I though
Now where did I put my 2006 laptop? 🤔

What if goku was betrayed and locked in the time chamber for a millennium
i know everyone praises the music choice, but come on, even compared to AMVs out there this is very low-effort.
ugh... why tho? 👎
what in the! this was unexpected
Who let the 2000s kids in charge of trailer composition?
Is this a gmv?
Why do I love this so much? This was very well done and probably has me more hyped for.the game then any other trailers before.
Who let some 2008 Youtube AMVs to be the marketing?
WHAT WHY IS THIS GIVING 2012 AMV VIBES SO HARD THIS IS INSANE LMFAO.
Ex-fucking-scuse me?????

Is this real life?! Or am I having the best dream of my life!
Chat is this real?
I’m just imagining they asking for permission to Evanescence to use the song for Elden Ring Nightreign Lol
What tf is this song choice man 🤦‍♂️
Dude I first thought they weren’t doing the song and it just sounded familiar  Cmon fromsoft what is this 2011?
Can I preinstall now?
Did I just get sent back 10+ year's ago? because it's been a while since I've seen seen this style of video.
First DMC now Nightreign?? Evanescence is coming back
This is so random
Anyone got reminded of the Kingdom Fall trailer for DS3?
UM??????????????
"what if Morgott got betrayed and was trapped in the hyperbolic time chamber for 1000000 years"
Sully reference?
Did elden ring make them so much money that fromsoft is just actually doing it for fun?
How do I rate this 5 stars??!!!
Bandai Namco: "Alright, what's a good song should we use for the Nightreign Trailer?"  Jackson from Marketing: "...Hear me out--"
First a movie, now this... is FromSoft finally selling out?
is that evascenesene?
emo goth Monster Hunter?
who is here after the rehearsal
Is this even real holy hell.
WHAT YEAR IS IT
Why though? Lmao.
THE DOUBLE TAKE I DID SEEING THIS??? BABYGIRL (gender neutral) I THOUGHT THIS WAS A FAN GMV NOT A PROPER TRAILER??? OBSESSED????? Fantastic, maybe nature is healing actually GFDSDFVGB
bro wut, what's next? linkin park wylder montage 😂
What is the point playing the same game with a little change?
VORDT OF THE BOREAL VALLEY STILL UNANNOUNCED??? YIKES!!!
Where Goku Super Saiyan 1-10 tho?
I'm really confused what I'm supposed to do in June 2025: play an Elden Ring variant game, or try to land a plane on water.
Ok why does this lowkey go hard
First Devil May Cry Anime uses Limb Biz and now this?!?
but why
Broooo what!!! Take me back to daredevil 😂
how many trailers will this game have?
Another fake trail.... Wait whaaattt
Who are these people making these trailers and channeling their skills from AMVs they made years ago
I needed to check if I didn't put a AMV by mistake
what year is it
I just wanna know who came up with this and and what was the feedback during focus testing this idea
This has to be a joke? Who tf approved of this? It's giving me old YouTube vibes lol
Omfg on the official bandai youtube???!!!!!
Any ideas?
what timeline are we in
What on earth am I seeing and hearing????
I thought this was another DLC, not a whole game
So recluse is INT build and revenant is FTH?
are you fuckin serious rn
What year is it?
the bitrate on this 1080p video was atrocious. Why and how is a multi million dollar game studio uploading trailers in 1080p and not 4k,
How about In The End by Linkin Park?
I was genuinely like, "Bring me to life, wonder what that means?" Thought it might have been like a story trailer, did not expect that lol.
Anybody else rock hard or is it just me? 😅
First DMC now Nightreign? Man Evanescence are for the GAMERS
Which one of you Gen Z interns did this ? Can you do it again ?
*This is not real…* *am I dreami-?* WAKE ME UP-
can i ask, who is that girl? is she a new class in deluxe version?
Is she some random conjourer? Spirit tuner like roderika? Or is she more michaela based? Would make for intresting classes a pure summons character, a character with power from michaelas abundance of grace?
What in the goddamn...?
Good god! What year is it!
Lmao, is this 2006?!
why does this feel more like cod zombies than modern cod zombies
Why animations keep looking so clunky tho😂
...wait... is this _actually_ the trailer? And not a shitpost??
wtf, am I back in time or something? feels like 2008 all over again
You think Sully was watching this trailer in the cockpit before pulling of the miracle on the Hudson?
is ts tuff in the lands between? 🥀🥀🙌
TELL ME WHY - PENPALS??? PLEASE
Is the next trailer gonna have Linkin park or 30 seconds to Mars?
... why this silly song tho?
I have many questions but shall receive no answers
What is this amv ahh trailer 💀💀💀💀
So does this confirm Anomalocaris as the 10th wayfarer?
what timeline are we in.
The Rehearsal reference?!
Bring me to Life and Elden ring? This isn't real -checks the user-  . . .  -double checks User-   . . .. well damn
Does it play tomorrow Thursday 9:00pm?
How do you unlock Sully
Ok but where's goku?
What the hell? What year is it?
man how far fromsoft fell
What in the Bionicle AMV is happening
OMG, my favorite band's most famous song in a Nightreign trailer!  Am I dreaming?!?!?
Is this real? Lmao
Why this song. why....
What’s with the song? Does not fit at all.
Can a lore Youtuber please do a deep dive on the song in this trailer? Is this supposed to be Miquella singing to Radahn?
What year is it?! When was the last time any trailer used this song?! >.>
…got any ideas?
Sully Sullenberger, is that you?
A stroke?  Am I having a stroke?  Is it 2006 again?
So where is Goku here?
Evanescence in this economy?
wtf do you mean this is the official account
Is this a fever dream?     Wake me up
Vaati, where does Evanescence fit before or after the Golden Order?
Is this a Cannon AMV?
In an era of tone deaf publishers, how did they manage to do everything right!? WAKE ME UP.
spartan what is your profession ⁉️
What year is it!?
Raise your hand if you recognize the song from the 2000 Daredevil Ben Affleck movie 🙌
Yo, is this the year 2008? We just making machinima music videos.
Why does this fit so well?
I wonder if this is part of the official soundtrack. 😊
Did we go back in time ?  are we in 2008 and all the Videos have bring me to life from evanescence.  Man this hits nostalgia in whole different way.
how do i like a video more than once 😍
I really went from just screaming laughing at this song choice to just staring at the screen like “hang on… it’s peak???”
What's the point of making a cheaper game if you're going to have a marketing budget that's twice the games budget?
Why the garbage music? Original score would have been preferred.  Had to watch this on mute.
What year is it?  Is it the early 2000s again?
Bruh, what year am I in?
😂😂😂 What song for the next trailer? Crawling_-_Linkin_Park.mp3?
Good song for old time. But looks like dirty trick fan made =/ Dunno

Excuse me?? What is actually going on here?
Why do I feel like the Netflix Devil May Cry show is partially responsible for this existence?
What world is this that such a thing can be? 👀
Are we for real right now
Does anyone remember the True Colors song they choose for that Ds3 trailer? They love mixing music that creates a juxtaposition to the gameplay and visuals.
Holy crap, what year is this again? We're doing official FMV's now?
Is this 2005!? The only thing missing is "Naruto amv" in the title.
...is it 2008?
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?????
What? Lol
Guys what timeline are we in?
What year am I in rn, 2009???
WHAT YEAR IS IT?!
Did Nathan Fielder produced this trailer?
Is this the early 2000s again back when you could do videos like this without copyrights going berserk?
This isn't real....right?
Very odd music choice, though I guess maybe with the “tarnished” and these night people who eventually disappear, maybe there’s some connection?
wait, where's ssj13 goku?
What?!
What in Miquella’s name is this song choice?  😂
bring me to life but not a single clip of the executor transformation ??
why this go hard tho
