Are snake bite kits work in USA with Rattlesnake
What brand and model is the gimble that the Action 5 camera is mounted on?
So where’s Part2?? 🤪🤦‍♂️🤷
How come you didn't give the cameraman a beer?
Where's ya yabby net Knackers
Where is that Highway
You went to Carnarvon Gorge and didn't go in, was it because you couldn't drive up to everything and get out to take a photo?
Whens the 2nd half of this airing?
@4WD247 Would love to see the literary of the trip ??
So Graham how much smaller is the Y62 compared to the "big" American trucks?
Graham could you please do a cost breakdown on those trips?  Like fuel, camping and such! Im planing a 60 day trip bringing my own ride, renting a truck for the trip so would love a cost breakdown  :)
The cameraman’s nearly redundant?  Make an episode from their point of view.  How they get up the tracks before you hit them, what gear they use while they use them and who drives the camera rig.  They’ve brought us the footage for years.🇦🇺👍
We have a tunnel like that in Kentucky. It's called Nada Tunnel. I wonder, if it's Nada tunnel, what is it. 😂 dad joke
so as an American, I'm curious: if you call a camper, a van, then what do you call a van?
Are you guys looking for a couple to tour with you!? We are ready to leave the house lol
38:21 what camping chair is that?
When is that cool old short wheelbase Nissan 4x4 coming back on the channel?
For the cutting through rock road question, asked an ol fella at the pub why this may have been a thing. Apparently it meant less road maintenance if you cut into rock because nothing would grow back there. Also we came to the conclusion depending on the area may have been for prospection reasons while on the way to another place.
What's a rowt?
Is Stef pregnant?
Hey Graham, are all of those roads public gazetted roads, or did you travel through private property. I would definitely love to do this particular trip. It looks like a completely awesome journey.
can some body pass on the gps location of this  time stamp please  27:41
I had something similar in my aquarium as a kid and they were called a eel tail catfish at the pet store here but not sure if it’s the same thing 👌🏻
Is it just me or does Steph and Harley look different this time
Do you know where the Rock Art is in Birdsville?
Excited for the new episode but where's Steph and Harley?
