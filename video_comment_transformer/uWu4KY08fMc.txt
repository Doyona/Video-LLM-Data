why are the subtitles so small? I can't read them 😭
Will the MV be released tonight at midnight (Japan time) then? Teaser last night, then Osaka leg of the tour tomorrow, and Japanese MVs usually released a month before the album... what do you think?
Jeongyeon, why are you drawing grafitti on the bridge? 😳🤣
did everyone else notice all the members are in daylight except for dahyun?
I really wanna know what kind of songs is this
Why does this looks and sounds like it’s gonna be their most emotionally charged single to be released yet???
Is Tzuyu holding a Lamy Safari?
Pleaseeee tell me that guitar riff is in the album 😭🔥🔥🔥
That distortion??Look like it would be absolute banger😍🤩🔥
That riff at the end is from one of the songs? ... cuz if it is, it sounded fucking great!
That last part with the drums 😧 ?!! Im hoping they’re going for more of a rock style type of beat, but I wonder how are they going to do it? Anyways I just know it’s gonna be good 😌
brooooooooooooooooooooo the music in the end!?!?!??!?!?
Is this going to be like rewind? I’m dying for another ballad that has the same vibes, something I can cry to 😫😭
Pain? What 😢😢😢
Why do I got emotional on the last 10 seconds of the teaser.
FK YEAAAA, is it my idea or will it be ROCK? 😭💗💗
