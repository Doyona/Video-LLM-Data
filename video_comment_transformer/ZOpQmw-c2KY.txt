What is Numair’s problem? Miracles happen. He should be happy about his baby. His wife needs his emotional support in this hour.
Any Nepali here?

34:34 Am I the only one who thinks Andaleeb's facial expressions after knowing about the DNA test are not of shock, astonishment, or sadness, but of fear. It seems to me as if she's scared that he is doing a DNA test, as if she's apprehensive that her secret will be out, as if she's anxious what will happen now.
Any Bangladeshi's here?? 🇧🇩
