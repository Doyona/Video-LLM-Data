Am I the only one who went over to skill's channel to check the intro to see if he used it
42:46 Excuse me Jimmy!?!?
How does he have a mob egg in 33:37
Forgot the bread bridge?
What's funny about spanners and "bridges span things" that just what they do what am I missing
Where did he get the spawn egg
Can we talk about the spawn egg
35:01 what did scar say? or am i tweaking
Is there another fan of Real Civil Engineer? With all those bridges, you should've called yourselves the Engineers.
35:20  Chill with the bridges G xD ever since bread bridge really?
5:10 is that a spawn egg? lmao
What about the freeloaders
34:17 the random person falling out of the sky?!
6:35 “how’d that happen” most accurate sentence in mincraft

47:35 Why does Grian have a spawn egg?! Did I miss something?
i GOTTA know how those NBTs were rigged to auto stack. it would save so many mod devs
28:57 anyone notice the spawn egg???
Man I need to try this out in Minecraft now. I’ll figure it out. Hopefully. Actually does anyone have the command block for this? Or is this a mod?
why is there a skeleton spawn egg in grians inventory?
a wildcard could be that every food is like a sus stew and you get a random new effect every time you eat something new
Why does he have a spawn egg
You could be called the bridge boys maybe?
Ok actually what is a spanner and a plonker?
Why did grian have a spawn egg at 42:50
THIS HAS SO MUCH ANIMATIC VALUE! THE DRAMATIZATION WE COULD DO! MOB BOSS GRIAN 39:03 "Who?" *slow head turn* I AM LOVING THIS EPISODE
We could walk or we could floatsi Wolsi😂
What is it with Mumbo and names only based on the gimmick
"Why are they building a car?"  It's Secret Life Season 2.
13:24 ...Why is there a skeleton spawn egg there? Where did that come from???
anyone notice at 13;30 grian has a spawn egg?
43:22 was that a hawk tuah reference?
26:20 how did he get that spawn egg?
Did anyone else realize someone falling from the sky at 34:15 😭😭
Did grian forget about the bread bridge
Is keep inventory on?
Does Grian know what chasing the dragon means?
wildcard idea: when you place blocks they randomize into random blocks so that could be fun when base building
Day 36 of asking Grian to bring back build swap
Why is no hermit craft being posted? Did the season end so fast?
Anyone else waiting for the next episode to come out?
Hermitcraft where?😭
30:04 Would cherry-flavoured Wotsits be a good idea, or a bad idea?
31:53 I know Grian made the season, but can someone explain why he needs a spawn egg?
For your bridge base what if u build a cloud then have a bridge connecting the cloud to the bridges 🤔
actually though? I miss hermitcraft
where is hermitcraft been?
was the skin clue because of mumbo's waffle? lol
I'm so curious about the skin "hint," like, what does it mean???
What’s with the spawn egg? 2:31
Why does Grian have a skeleton spawn egg?
Did anyone else hear the faint scream as skizz died 😂 Edit: after further watching the video i see that skizz died more than once. Rip 💀
Am I the only one seing a face in the base???
how does Grian have a spawn egg?!
Is the wither effect not included with this wildcard because I'm surprised nobody got it while testing foods and I'm surprised nobody died from it
Whats the spawn egg at 12:55?
Why does Grian have a panda spawn egg?
what happened to the boogeyman in this series?
How come Grian has a skeleton spawn egg?
5:00 why does he have a spawn egg?
If you think about it, the top bridge looks like eyes, and the second bridge looks like a mouth
what if this teams thing was that they change their name every week
Just a question grian when are you going back to hermitcraft
Why is Grian giving such mom energy this episode?
Where are the gale comments?
Where is hermitcraft
Why did Grain have a spawn egg
How are we like 6 seasons in and the colours are still not colourblind friendly?! Grian. Green, Lime Green and Yellow look the EXACT same for me and Red only looks slightly different. Use Yellow, Blue, Black, White, etc for very different colours
33:50 did anyone else notice the falling light dots on the left side of the screen on the sky
can i just ask what the spawn egg is about?? i dont remember him getting it or what it would be for and nothing was said about it so im a little confused
A bit off topic but grian PLEASE do this year's phasmophobia Halloween event
I wonder how the theme song is going to be.
Just out of curiosity, why or how does grian have spawn egg?
why can't the wildcards be like... randomly picked? like 30 wildcards 1 is picked like each episode and it's picked randomly wouldn't that work?
For a wildcard what if every half-hour or so people character skins' and names get swapped so then no one will know each other.
Could there be a boogie man tag as a wildcard ? Even pore paranoia for the spanner’s 😂
Hi grian will u ever bring back build swap?
Why does Mumbo have grians waffle?
Why does Brian end up with bridge builds? 😂😂😂😂 first bread bridge, now tribridge
Where did you get the spawn egg?
Maybe a floating wood platform id not the best idea in a series famous for burnt bases
How does grian have a spawn egg
What happened to hermitcraft
Loving this adventure so far What’s the best survival tip you've learned from this episode
35:30 what about bread bridge from limited life?
Cool idea: At the finale episode, you could bring all of these wildcards back but like they all happen at different times in the season but they stack?
Did anybody else notice at 34:16 somebody just falls from the sky in the background 😂😂
Will the life series shop be reopening with this series at any point? I would love to get myself some more merch 👀
Grian, there was an internet cut-out where I live. Do you think they are connected?
Am I the only one who noticed the skele spawn egg in grian's inventory the whole time?
is there a place to download the modpacks used in the life series, so this can be organized with friends ?
Why is there no boogyman? I think that's why everyone is so chill.
Why does he have a spawn egg ??
What if the final wild card.. is ALL of them in one
"Scar, what are you doing??" "Building a rollercoaster!! 😃"
How long has mumbo had a waffle?
wtf is this series. No plans nothing entertaining so far.
The issue with the wooden bridge is scar may come and start burning bridges
I just thaught what if there was a wild card that makes it so you can uncraft things
Can someone tell me why the default fps for this video was 230?
2:30 BRO HOW IN THE WORLD DOES GRIAN HAVE A SPAWN EGG below birch logs
Wildcard concept: nothing actually happens and everyone is trying to figure out what happens
42:47 he has a spawn egg?
Wildcard idea: all hostile mobs become charged creepers. Alternatively, all mobs are armored or have increased health.
Does mumbo also have an waffle on the back or has that just always been there?
Is the next episode going to be unabridged?
am i the only one who thinks they should be called “The Bride Buds” 👇
Eating well, or hardly eating?
Hear me out.. how about randomized inventory space??😮   As soon as the wild card is picked, items speu out of peoples inventory. And every few minutes, it randomizes again!
mumbo: we've made no progress because of this wild card grian: *goes off and makes progress* mumbo: why would you leave me
I  am in so hard  Uhmmm grian what you mean
19:11 what if you guys had a new name every session, like a running gag
Mumbo "should we put something underneath it like a dangly bit?" How about clay balls?
Im wondering if dandelion suspicious stew would give you food regardless
30:00 why does he just have a skeleton spawn egg???
is there going to be  a new hermit craft video soon? (no hate just wondering!!)
2:43 is that a spawn egg in your inventory?
I’m kind of worried as I watch this season that Jimmy isn’t going to be first out, what are the fans gonna do when that happens…?
Who tf is the sugarplum fairy?
Is it just me or did anyone else see a face in the bridges? Typical Grian building 36:26
“Wanna smoke?” Most British thing grian has asked mumbo
How about every session you add a word to your group name? Current name: Sub-1 Spanners.
Why not change your group name every session? 😂😂😂
Why does mumbo have a waffle?
Wild card idea: every mob drop is randomised 🦐
What about hermitcraft?
where's the Boogeyman
Wild card idea: Some people can’t place blocks, some people can’t break blocks, and it changes at regular intervals like the food thing
33:22 so they also have some spawn eggs? like loot from chest i guess?
who is the sugar plum fairy
35:21 what about bread bridge in limited life? That was a lot of bridge lol
26:47 how does he have a spawn egg?
Grian can you build on the next Hermitcraft season a mega base like season 7?
Is this subtle hints at what game Grian is gonna play next with a group of friends??? More iconic duo: Grian and Don’t Starve Together  😂😂😂😂😂
33:39 spawn egg in inventory???
Do you know what this needs? A BRIDGE REVIEW
are these bridges also justa. decoy?? always a good season when a bridge is involved!
About 18 minutes into the video, why did you have a skeleton spawn egg in your inventory?
for a group name my first thought went to "the Tollmen" cause.. idk,, tollway,, bridge,,, toll men on a bridge, or if u could be the trolls,, cause,, trolls under the bridge
It was too late yesterday so I couldn’t watch the whole live stream will the whole stream be up on VOD or?
what's that spawn egg you have at 47:35
The amount of people asking about the skeleton spawn egg in the comments
what happened to hermitcraft?
why aren't you using bundles?
Skeleton spawn egg? In inventory
wild card idea: all the crafting recipes are randomized, but they change from 20-50 min, randomly and this would be funny, or have a random block become a giant chance cube
Why the Life series always remind me of adult swim? No matter what pov i watch. I love this.
Wildcard idea, mobs drop random blocks, and blocks drop random mobs.
How does grian have a spawn egg at 31:16?
Where’s hermitcraft you my main hermitcraft source
Grian why do u have a skeleton spawn egg? 21:14
Grian why do you have a spawn egg in your inventory???? 🤨
26:19 what's that spawn egg doing there grian
What if, and hear me out, every episode you all just add another name to your group. For example, you guys can now be known as the Sub One Spanners rather than just Sub One or just Spanners?
Did Mumbo always have waffle hair?
Okey the “S” on the base looks more like a Z
I wonder if this works in real life?
Hey grian, ik there is no suggestions for wild cards, but what if in the future, when alot of wild cards have happened, a wild card could be is that everyone gets a previous wild card permanently or it could be for 1 or 2 episodes.
35:22 Grian I will answer ur question and the answer is bread bridge
Wait if Grian and Scar are so close together, does that mean Desert Dou might be in this series?
29:54 im not sure if you are supposed to have a skeleton egg ??
Where is the boogeyman?
50:06 grian has the “plonker” pass?🤨
43:20 why did i hear "talk tauh"😭
I just wonder when there will start to be two wildcards at a time.
Who’s watching in 1945?
25:00 why is there a random spawn egg in Grians inventory? HMMMM? And why is it a Skeleton spawn egg?
Wild card idea everything you mine drops something that is not at all the thing you mined
why does mumbo have a waffle excuse me
21:28 I’m wondering that too but it’s even funnier that it was such an intense scenario editing grian had to mention it too
Good video, but what's up with making fun of Joel's car. It's a very good car, and he worked hard on that.
25:18 why when grian said "bucket" did it remind me of boris johnson saying "blue 😭"
Also what is it with Grain and bridges??😂😂
Randomized crafting is an idea, not sure if its a good one. But it's an idea.  Another thought would be playing with the number of hearts everyone has, maybe increasing them the fewer lives someone is on and decreasing them for people with more?
Hear me out ya'll build bridges up and down and have a toll or... Riddles, thus the trolls.
Is keep inventory on?
Is anyone noticing the monster spawner egg at 10min in
... Grian just has a slight advantage over the wildcard information?
Did anyone else notice that Grian had a (Skeleton?) Spawn egg for the whole session? Im not sure if i forgot something from last time or not.
Sorry why does Grian have a spawn egg?
whjy is keep inventory on?
No one expects the spanner inquisition.
4:48 as a pastime activity perhaps?
Every time a spanner dies, build another bridge?
5:12 hollup, Mumbo is onto something "What?"
girlie what is going on in that thumbnail
What is this seed? I really want to build your base is. I had an idea for a mine shaft.
Can you do a wid card that doubles graviity(can only jump half a block and fall damage happens with half as much of blocks and so on
34:18 am I the only one who saw someone in the distance fall from the sky? lol
Ok what’s with the spawn egg in Grian’s inventory?
Okay who wants to bet Skizz is gonna die first this season?
Here’s a wild card idea what if you have to break a block every five minutes or you’ll lose health
Cus if it’s the same why didn’t they just, drink milk
when does the fighting start?
At 13:25 , why does he have a skeleton spawn egg???
Potential future title: Wild Life: Episode ??? - Burning Bridges
Isn't a spanner a wrench?
what happened to the nice subtitles :(
Wildcard idea: recipes are randomized
34:17 Does anyone else see that?
43:21 the what now Grian?
Future episode- 100x100 or smaller world
Am I the only one who thought they were calling themselves the "Spaniards" for most of the video? They're British!!
Is this a bread bridge callback 🤔
What is up with hostile mob spawn?
Who the Sugar Plum Fairy?
anyone know who they would predict how many sessions there are to make the right amount of twists?
Should someone tell Skiz that spanner is British for wrench (aka: tool)? Maybe THEN he’ll appreciate the genius of the name.
How is Grian's episode longer than Mumbos's if he was mining for HALF AN HOUR?!
is this what the hunger games is about?
Why is the video sped up?
Wait... "randomiSed"?
The suger plum fairy?
When are u posting on hermitcraft season 10?
How was there so much death this session and none of them was Jimmy!?! The curse better get its @$$ in gear or he might actually win this time.
Wait what happens to hermit craft?
5:28 he has a spawn egg?
Why is it that these three can get stuff done solo but when they’re together, they have sub one braincells?
Wildcard idea : inventories and item textures are randomized Or randomizer (as in the sethbling datapack) Or prop hunt (player avatars are replaced by the block/item they’re holding.
Why was this upload so far after mumbos?
23:45 why does grian have a spawn egg lol
21:52 how did you get the egg?...
What if a wildcard was fishing could give you other Minecraft items ? Like sugar cane ,stone,iron?or basically anything
* Wild Card Idea: Reverse Armour  * Thorns damages you when you hit mobs, fire resistance sets you on fire, unbreaking destroys armour super quickly, curse of binding prevents armour from being put on, etc
Why do they keep making things out of wood?
Wildcard idea: Is the sun gone? - It's permanently midnight after the wildcard is active.
Wildcard idea: sideways gravity
Did I just see Grian have a spawn egg?
Did grian just give us a fake ad at the end…?
wildcard suggestion: Half of the server become boogeymen. They each have to kill one person to avoid becoming red, so absolute chaos ensues and either half of the players turn red overnight, or people have a good bit of lives chipped away.
20:16 why does grian have a spawn egg?
I don't suppose it's possible to get these as a standalone datapack kinda thing? I'd love to try and do just a normal minecraft playthrough with food like this changing every couple in game days or whatnot.
So uh, how does grain have a skeleton spawn egg? He’s had it for the whole video 33:39
How is the meeting room not the shape of a spanner head? A move only a bunch of spanners could make.
Alright, let's get the predicitons up. What is next sessions wildcrad gonna be?  I'll guess that players are randomly gonna swap postions at certain intervals.
Them eating suger looks... suspicious if you know what I mean
Any merch?
5:18 care to explain what a ‘cheese dream’ is?
No merch yet?
4:30 Anyone know where the spawn egg came from?
30:25 how dos he have a spawn egg?
Grian when is the next hermit craft episode coming out? its been almost 2 months!
Wild card idea what if everyone gets chained to the closest person and if they walk away or are two far away will get pulled back
Wildcard Idea: Lava and water swap.
Why does Brian have a spawn egg?
Whats that spawn egg doing in your inventory grian?😂  Edit: 42:48
10:01 How did Grian get what looks to be a skeleton spawn egg? or is it a ghast spawn egg?
Why grain have mob egg?
Who still remembers the bad boys?
Ok really what spanner means in england ? 😂
This wild card was excellent, really fun to see. Wondering if we’ll see a peek back to the Disasters game with a wild card as the random teleport swap. Maybe they’ll teleport, maybe they won’t. Could be chaos
I wonder what the twist is
What if every block mined adds a “miner” amount of speed.
Love the vids <3, but is hermitcraft continuing during the life sires?
47:12 WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PLAYING MC WITH QUAGMIRE
(idea) hot potato? every 15 minutes 3 random poisoned items will be chosen, if a player has them in their inventory, they will get withering 1, chests in which these items are contained will drop all items on the ground if the items are not removed within 15 minutes
hmmm... Mumbo doesn't have the grey streak in the Life Series?  So it's a Hermitcraft storyline?
0:26 Why does he have a spawn egg?
what if damage was randomized? imagine oxidized copper dealing 19 hearts of damage but a diamond sword dealing 2
Why doesnt Mumbo want to change your team name from sub 1 club to sub 1 intelligence club?
Could you add the boogyman? That was my favorite and it would definitly fit the haloween season
grian... why do you have a skeleton egg?
Why does Grian have a spawn egg lol
Something I could have missed but still want to know do the wild cards stack?
If you’re reading this comment, which YouTubers’ pov(s) are you watching?    I’ll go first:  Grian Mumbo Jumbo GeminiTay Smallishbeans LDshadowlady
Who thinks Mumbo is going to kick Grian off the team with everything that's happened XD
How about instead of being called something new each episode, what if you guys ADDED to the name. For example, "The Sub-One Floaters", or "The Sub-One Spanners".
Did anyone else see the two people in the back ground falling down at 33:52?
Is the game laggy or the video or my cell phone? God😢
bread bridge mumbo?
How did 50000 people watch this video in 52 minutes
The sugarplumb fairy... is this a Crown of Candy reference? :D
I was wondering why you didn't upload at the same time as everyone else. Waited to watch yours first (tho got spoiled by scott's DAMN title!!!)
35:27 BAD BOYS BREAD BRIDGE MENTION??????  edit: 44:01 BREAD BRIDGE EXPLICIT NAMEDROP
Are we allowed to suggest wildcards? It would be cool but it might take awhile to implement
39:40 Why does Grian have a spawner egg?
What if every few episodes had a wildcard which had permanent effects.  Like if, for example, you stayed the height you were at the end of the first session
Did anyone else notice the spawn egg in grians inventory?
Did no one notice that spawn egg in grians inventory
Sugar plum fairy??
Who up rn watching this
21:59 Wait what
13:26 why does he have a skeleton spawn egg?
why does grian have a panda spawn egg?
Does anyone know if the Life Series Merch store is going to open up again??
Where’s hermitcraft
I am the only one who keeps forgetting they can shift near edges now and is panicking everytime they get close?
Wildcard idea: Is the moon big?   After the wildcard is activated, the moon begins growing at a rapid pace, causing low gravity and tremors throughout the world
Why do I feel like Mumbo is going to become a hermit living in a small cave paranoid… Wait he already is-
surely the no-longer Sub Ones still stay together…right???
Eating.... Armor?
where is the hermit craft episode
2 minutes ago? I was hoping for 10 seconds.
Time to finally find out if Grian did get all those diamonds legitimately...
1st? Perhaps i am and perhaps im not. What does it mean to be first? A question man asks its God everyday
2 veiws in 22 seconds? bro fell off
