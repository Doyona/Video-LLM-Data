Is he an Iranian director?
will maude + iris shoot seth?
it's legal to hit keanu will dwayne johnson hit him?
He really an Arch Angel VIP with himself looking forward to John Constantine 2 & more flims ?!  😊😮🎉😂❤
Why is Keanu doing anything movie with Seth Rogan???? He's part of the problem too. Seth is for the liberal and democratic party hard. I guess even Keanu has to make money. Handing out awards is different, at least he stood his ground to Whoopie Goldberg.
Wait a second that's not John Constantine!
lets see if Keeanu's charm can cancel out Aziz and Seth's terrible acting
Song:  Patrick Cowley, Sylvester - Do you wanna Funk?
idk why but keanu somehow fits perfectly for this role
Why is the acting so choppy
odd the mane who played John Constantine plays an angel... and also odd the "Archangel" Gabriel is a low tier angel??? I need explanations so I guess I gotta see this now
Is it just me or Keanu Reeves really lost his acting skills in this one? It seemed more of a newbie actor. Weird.
why does this man choose to star in some of the cringest randomest movies ever made? he is in fact a real angel though
the closest we have for john constantine?
What's the first background song called?
Is it AI generated??😅
Wait I'm confused. Is this a game or is ut a movie?
Is it Angel-A with Keanu?
why is keanu so robotic now
Does anybody know the name/artist of the disco song being played at 1:40??
Why? What happens with the world today?
what the shit is this Keanu Reeves as angle WTF.
So Constantine and Gabriel switched roles?
funny story about guy from the boat? omg...
wtf is this shit
Would this be a goofier version of “City of Angels”?
How did they get an original script made in hollywood? Or is this based on some previous movie that doesn't come to mind?
John wick doing side quest
Did he just drive Jhonny 911 turbo porche?
why does every voice seems like bullshit? lol
At 1:10 is that the Porsche 911 that was featured in cyberpunk?? I have the freakin hot wheels of this car
Really Constantine? REALLY?!
This is all we get from Aziz after all these years?!? I want him to do standup again
Why do they sound so weird..?
Did I see a Johnny silverhand porsche?
What is Tom Haverford up to
Is it just me? Or does some scenes looks like AI? Especially the first few
Is that Azealia Banks???😂
I thought Aziz was cancelled?
Did Keanu just come out as an angel?
why do I feel like I've already seen this???
No way Seth Rogan making a comedy ?
Did John Wick 5 just turned into a comedy?
Out of know where they got aziz to be in this? Os he even active still?
hmmmm, Keanu's waiting for his next big script - others have their 9th house to buy
Wait What John Wick 5 or maybe Constantine 2
jesus christ  - what's up ?
wtf is this..
whats that song in the background that starts at 1:07?
Is this AI ?
John Wick as my angel? Go ahead , make me unstoppable.
Did ai make this?
ahh, he's an angel now huh. is he will be still kicking and punching in this movie? this is kinda interesting.
This looks terrible. Why would anybody be in something written so horribly?
Yo what is the last song that plays in the trailer PLEASE
OMG is this even real? this is truly terrible
Is this John Wick 5?
The construct has evolved into an angel now?
"Am I the only one who thinks Keanu is not as good an actor as people say?"
Why does Keanu Reeves always look like he’s parodying as a Keanu Reeves on a budget?
Is this some kinda lame reboot of "Trading Places"?
Why do movies always make Michael the badass hes depicted as in the bible but Gabriel, who is also a pretty powerful archangel, is always depicted as a joke, bad guy, or just a plebe... the only exception I can think of is Gabriel from Legion. And he was still a "bad guy"
Why tf do they all sound so weird wtf, horrible audio quality
WTF is this
Can Keanu please be my Guardian Angel?
So is this a Johnny Silverhand situation where he plays as a voice and an imagine in someone else head?
John wick became an angel? 😂
What are they doing to the Boggy Man
What is this
Keanu is 60 now.  Where did the time go?
Wait so a profit can't fix his problems so he called an angle? 😂
Lol wheres franco seth?? We swapped for azis
What is the resolution going to be? He’s right money does solve most of the problems we have if we don’t have it.
why aziz ansari though??? can't stand his....voice....
Why is he copying my boy castiels fit
Just had a realization, what if these comments are AI? Lol Fabricate good comments so people can watch the movie. You wouldnt be able to tell unless taking the time to look through everyone's profile. And even then a company can just elaborately make fake profiles. Just saying. But, I would watch this movie. Lol
Did KR really need to do a rip off of Constantine? We need this like Pirates of the Caribbean 8. And Rocky 28.
What’s wrong with their cartoonish voices ?!
Michael meets freaky friday meets white chicks?
From burning Arasaka Tower to Guardian Angel, really?
I thought the trailer usually shows the best parts?
Blasphemy ?
Johnny silverhand???
Hmmm.... idk about this one. Keanu is great as always, but the movie overall looks meh.
Man they really struggling in the movie industry what the frick is this
Isn’t this just Trading Places mixed with It’s a Wonderful Life.
How did this guy rope in Keanu???😅
WTF is this ? 😅
Gabriel is literally one of the most powerful Angels in heaven, how is he a budget Angel???
Wait john wick is in this movie?
john wick is an angel after he died in part 4 ??
When will this color grading style die 🤮  Bring back film. Every movie/show looks the same.
Keanu finally has lost all his last few acting skills? 🤣
John Wick this you twin?
what targets audiences is this ?
Sooo.. is there a reason to watch this movie? It kinda feels like the movie will be a longer version of this trailer
I wonder if they picked that exact porche because of cyberpunk and Keanu's affiliation with it? 😅
So do we know the exact date of when this is coming out?
First time he's not called John?
Am I the only one who's first reaction was "AZIZ ANSARI IS BACK- YES!"?
How can Constantine, John Wick and an Angel be the same person?
Was that the same car  Keanu’s character had in cyberpunk?
indian guy switches place with jewish guy and his problems been solved... what do they mean by this
Why does the first few scenes look ai generated? I think it’s got to do with the camera movement. Or maybe Keanu acts like an ai haha
Why does it sound like Phineas is talking to john wick?
Why does the audio (specifically Keanu) sound AI generated? Have I just been playing too much Cyberpunk2077?
Hey isn't that small guy Big T from Parks and Rec?
Ayoo..what happened to our Baba Yaga?!
Is this the new age Dogma?
so is this john wick's redemption arc in heaven after he died?
Didn't this dude sexualy assault a woman?
Aw. Cheap, rigid prop wings that move in one piece? Missed opportunity.
Why is Keanu's dry delivery so...perfect?
"what's my direction?"  "um... just act like a bad keanu reeves...."  "that's hurtful man"
Foreshadow sneak peek of potential Johnny Silverhand?
Is he trying to act really badly?  Because its working...😮
People have been asking me if I'm an angel and I haven't had an answer. But yeah, I'm thinking I'm an angel!
Why does Keanu's voice sound a bit robotic?
Why can't he change his hair tho. This is basically like multiverse cable .
Shadow and Donkey Kong in a movie?
This looks like a random shit made movie but at least we still have Keanu Reeves around to act.

Am I the only one who sees the Artist's name wrong in the Title IGM??? Who The Fuck Is "SETH ROGAN?"

Where the heck has Aziz been???  Glad hes back
Why has Keanu seamingly gotten worse and worse at acting
Why does Keanu sound funny? Like slurred speech?
John what the??😂😂😂
Why couldn't Aziz Ansari actually be unemployed when they were casting for this.
So it's a documentary?
Couldn’t he just play an angel without those corny wings?
Constantine became an angel? How far has he fallen 😂
