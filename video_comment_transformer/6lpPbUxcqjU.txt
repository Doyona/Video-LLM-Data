“Pull me up” is indeed the perfect name if you eat it like that. The only question is where?  Of the couch or into heaven?😂
Hey why didn’t I see this before entering the shop?
What's tiramisu, and am I missing out?
I thought tiramisu is from japan
How long would it take to eat a wheelbarrow of tiramisu? Assuming you’re using a tablespoon and the wheelbarrow is able to hold 4 cubic feet of tiramisu, and assuming the tablespoon is 1.5*1.8*0.2 inches (at the scoop), you’d need to eat 768 inches of tiramisu 3.24 inches at a time, dividing to about 238 scoops of tiramisu, rounded to account for the decimal. Assuming each scoop takes the same amount of time as in the video, about 5 seconds, plus 3 seconds to chew and swallow, you’d have to spend about 32 straight minutes of eating tiramisu nonstop. Tl;Dr you’d need 238 scoops and 32 minutes to eat the tiramisu out of a wheelbarrow, at least.
Where is mine 😂
Is cheese is cheap in italy? Here in Indonesia for "real cheese" Is so expensive

@Lionfield I have a genuine question about Italian culture and cuisine. We all know it’s not traditional to put pineapple on pizza or break spaghetti, but is it alright to ask for no cocoa powder on Tiramisu? I don’t like chocolate, but don’t want to order without the cocoa if it could be offensive. Thanks in advance, love your content!
