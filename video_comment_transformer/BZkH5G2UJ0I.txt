Wth is that sht
What is this video format? 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
How much will the Sylas skin cost?
Why is there 6? Why is there Sylas and Yone?
Why are there 6?
Why there are 2 skins for Faker? Sylas and Yone.
why is varus the only skin with a T1 logo in the animation ???
where are the T1 logos ?
why 6 skin? who's the other one?  like  Gnar-zeus Sylas-faker Vi- oner Varus- gumayusi Pyke- keria Yone?
the special effects r kinda plain ngl. and where tf is the t1 logo other than in recalls?
Don't tell me that lissandra that looks like Yone won against GALIO??!!
will they ever go back to making simple skins with clean sounds ? everything sounds like fucking exploding crystals and collapsing caves
Why does the t1 skins look so basic
Am I the only who just thinks the skin looks like an alternate time line where they are from noxus?
The skins are nice but am i the only one who wouldnt be surprised if these were pentakill skins instead, they seem rather close 👀
2:52 Who’s kevin?
They actually cooked! What year is this?
Does anyone know the reference of pyke recall? I know everyone else’s: gnar: zeus hitting his head with a trophy, yone: the faker pose, varus: guma eating croissant, and vi: the oner style jacket
Why the hell its look like a childs of Morauder and Coven ? 🤨🤨
Why ever on earth faker has to get 2 Skins.  But ehy whatever lookin good.
Why Faker got two? I mean nice but i wonder, above that the skins are amazing!
do we  know the price of each skin ?
All the skins look sick. Big question mark for me though is Faker Yone. If any T1 player would get Yone shouldve been Zeus. Faker could play it in a pinch but Zeus Yone was the real pick people actually feared.  If we were doing 2 skins for Faker and his legacy deathcap Galio wouldve cooler IMO. Besides that Oner Vi recall is probably the coolest recall for me. You know that the jacket on shoulders is Oner even if they removed the nameplate. If Oner ever gets to the hall of legends would love a Xin Zhao skin.
not that i'm upset at the designs overall, but why yone
So, previous year T1 skins are light mode and these ones are dark mode?
how about taunts, death animations and respawn animations ?
will t1 jinx come back with the new ones or is it only in chests?
I thought yone gets a Prestige skin?
Is this covenant?
Guys where's Galio skin 🥹🥀
Wth is a prestige at this point like is it just bulkier vfx now???? Like that sylas skin is just another casual T1 skin
Where is reckless skin?
So is it T1 Gnar or HLE Gnar?
What did pyke recall refers to?
Am I the only one who doesn't like the sfx? Feels not menacing, except Pyke W for me. But I like the skins tho. (Can't afford them anyway so I'll shut up)
I feel like gnar doesnt have much changes...? I mean, check SSG he has new model, but T1 feel like classic model with few changes :c
1. Is the prestige with us in the room? 2. They look like Marauder skins
gnar skin completely butchered, what is this toy
Just me or are they too bright n flashy id go blind ingame
Why Varus recall doesn't have a cup?
I thought it was a bit lacking in showing the T1 symbol on the Skin, it erases quickly, Gnar's W and R would look better, imagine if Pyke's ult shows a "T1" when executing the enemy, Yone's R leaves the trail of T1 or Faker's name, but the skins are VERY BEAUTIFUL
Why is it not Red Gold for T1, the color scheme is generic
They look amazing but the sound is kinda off idk
why the betrayal guy chose gnar ? 😂
IS IT ALWAYS AN INVISIBLE AMUMU YOUR BEATING UP ON?! poor guy cant catch a break
Why Zeus got 2 champions?
What in the marauder
Idk if its just me but the vfx/aesthetic looks like the Marauder skin line (the one with Kalista and Xin Zhao)
Surely the Sylas skin won't be another $500 scam case, right? RIGHT?!
wait, did they hint that if u get a pentakill with t1 pyke heavy is the crown starts playing in game?
Does pyke recall have a meaning? Enlighten me
So it’s a Coven knock off?
How can riot miss 5 times in a row? 😂
Question: Why does Faker have a Prestige Sylas skin and a Yone skin? I thought it was a Skin + Prestige of the same champ for MVPs.
What if Pyke got a star above the T1 logo every time he killed with his R?
The color and animations are so clean  But Im not sure about the slyas skin even though is cool doesn't really have much t1 references
finallyyyy a good sylas skin after freljord and with nightbringer yasuo vibes too?
Where is T1 galio 😢😢😢
New marauder skins, or someone replaced orange with red on pentakill?
Oh that was Yone in the thumbnail?! I thought it was Lissandra
did they recycle high noon yone into this one?
is vi’s skin legendary? her animations look different from base
How tf they managed to code Oner's jersey? XD
It's 1.350 RP?
Yone should be prestige, am I missing something ?
how do we know this is t1 sylas without recall?
When will they come out in the game?
why isn't there a single t1 logo  *okay pyke has one
Immediately? Cool
