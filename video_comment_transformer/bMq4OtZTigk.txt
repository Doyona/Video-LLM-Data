Will there be transgender NPCs? Asking for nefarious reasons
Is that the i-4 eye-soar @ 4:35 ? 😂
that does not look like an air traffic control tower behind the vice airport sign
What do you think we need for the max graphics and high fps requirement of gta6
Looking gorgeous and I can't wait for the release date but the big question - will my humble PC with a Ryzen 5700+RTX 3060ti and 32 GB of RAM be able to run this game or will I need to upgrade to a much more powerful CPU ?
What if Tommy Vercetti had a son, and that son fights to reclaim his father's lost drug empire? With the help of some old friends from Vice City.
Who is here after trailer 2!!
Who else is here after watching the second trailer
Who’s here after trailer 2

Who's here after trailer 2

Does anyone else think her boyfriend resembles Micheal from gta 5 ?
How t send superchat
The map shows the Bermuda Triangle. Wonder if it just like the real
Is this the first time gta is going for realism in their characters look? They no longer look  cartoonish like gta 5.
It's a dodge challenger y'all gotta know the difference
Where is GTA 6?
Are we not going to talk about the different states as license plates
Bro how is this already a year ago 💀🙏😭
Who would not buy this game?
Why nobody talks about the RR Cullinan ?
Trailer was released a year ago what ???
What if thats not even Jason in the first trailer but possibly someone completely different lol
is it only first person view
Wow. Is this a game or movie. My mind cant get it 😮
Why is no one appreciating IGN here ? This is a really well done video capturing every little detail correctly. Good work IGN!!
Everyone is in doubt of Playstation 5 Pro rendering GTA6 60fps@4k....Everyone seems to forget that Rockstar was already developing the game around base PS5.With the trailer looking this good imagine now having upgraded hardware and Mark Cerny's involvement i think we all have a pretty good chance of experiencing the game that will exceed our expectations.
But we didn’t notice there small kids and teenagers only adults?
Who's here on 1 year anniversary?
Why is everyone missing the releasedate in the trailer??
whats the background music .... press like to put pressure on ign😅
What is the release date for GTA VI please
is FishingGarret there in Gta 6?
13:57 pls tell me am not the only one who sees the kids playing in the mud 😭😭
There’s going to be so many Easter eggs and mysteries to unpack too
If there’s really this much detail and graphics, this is going to be a laggy game
This is it?
Pibwasser? Seriously?
You got all that from a one minute thirty second video? Dude you must possess some sort of super power or something
Why im so addicted to watching gta 6 details
Will lucia have menstrual cycles? If so will it affect gameplay?
My GTA5 Online character (created in 2018) has the same clothes as Lucia at 1:47 . Coincidence ? Details...
What about ps4?
Another girl boss? Shieeeet
Not to nitpick but that was a challenger not a charger
What would you guys think of an online social media in the online mode of gta 6? Imagine getting famous in a game through a a game 😂
Anyone wanna tell him this is all CGI and not using game engine?
What about mobile?
Should the "ida" in Leonida" be pronounced the same as the one in "Florida"?
Maybe 200 to 500 GB total game size for this game?
Series S??? I don’t think so
It will be interesting how they do their first female protagonist and it makes me wonder if they will implement some of rdr2's features for weapons like customization or maintenance
Why do you think Waezle news is a parody of Fox news when the theme is white and red ? CNN is white and red.
6:32  Are we just gonna glide over the car that looks very similar to a lamborghini aventador svj
Anyone else mad they do not include skateboarding or rollerblading??? Shii even throw in scooters 🛴
not American, but almost every word with leo in it, followed by a consonant is pronounced as "Leh",  right? you even got Leonard County (leh nard). isn't it possible Leonida ( especially with Florida being a 3 syllable word as well) is pronounced as "Leh Nida" or even "Leh Nuh Da" like "Floh Ruh Da" ? havent heard anyone say it like that yet, but it seems like a possibility.
Will cleetus mcfarland be in this game ?😂
Lets see how many hundreds of gigabyte this game is..
Damn console first?  Will it at least be on gamepass?
Will there be GTA 6 online?
Can we carry dual gun in GTA 6?

8:35 its a dodge challenger
At 18:28 next to the Tom Petty sticker is that steel panthers the shocker? 🤘🏻
10:56 Women? Sorry, that's a dude. No women has a chin like that 😂
Does anyone know if the online multiplayer will use AI NPC's?
When is gta 7 coming out ?
What about pc gta 6?
You guys missed the kids wrestling in the background in the mud kids in GTA VI ?
Who else saw Jason's car in the dirt bike scene
.... So now can we get new GTA V single player content? A few new clothes? Some hair styles? Some new activities like arm wrestling? Maybe a night club for single player? What about the casino interior and single player gambling??  Something???! Anything??!!!!!
Runnin down a Dream a vice city soundtrack? Have you ever played GTA VC? This Song was in San Andreas... K-DST...  not professional...
what if this is a reverse gta 3 story line where "claude" loves interest sells them out ... just reversed you know "Me too" 2023
Chop wasn't in gta 5 was he? He was in San Andreas
3:48 did anyone spot the puppy
gta 5 and and red dead 2 was build on the same multiplayer logic, riddled full of hackers that made online unbearable. Is that addressed in gta6 or are they just going to continue to pretend like it's not so and build of the same stuff?
when they in bed together, which character are you 😂
but why 99 why not 100
Did yall see Denice 🤣🤣🤣🤣
How much will a psp CD cost maybe $1700US
this isnt  gameplay footage its cutscenes wtf is this even about?
Are we allowed to submit our own playlist for 6
Is the vercetti estate still gonna be there?
Any news on *GTA VII* yet?
Im wondering what the file size will be if gta 5 was a 100gb then considering the huge amount of new varied data new textures huge map details crowd assets more ocean biome more characters story and all of it in higher quality. Im thinking it may actually be about 500gb and rockstar may want to sell it only as a bundled ssd pack and make a bunch of money
Did you pronounce pißwasser wrong on purpose or not lol
Any news on GTA 6 pre order date?  Wonder if there will be a online mode.
Yall forgot what an “airport” is?🤔☠️
yo chat how much will gta 6 be?
will the game exclusive again on ps5? or in all platform
Great breakdown... But pibwasser? 😊
why don't they use real brands and charge companies for that?
That’s a dodge challenger not charger
Ok are we certain that we are playing as both characters?! Because we don’t know the guys name and he doesn’t seem to be of super great importance this far yes he’s in the trailer multiple times but I’m starting to think maybe we will only be playing as Lucia.
So, are we gonna be forced to play as a female? also no mountains, completely flat terrain it seems.
8:34 why does everyone keep calling that the dodge charger. Its the callenger aka the gauntlet hellfire
10:50 Is that a pink Ford Crown Victoria?
what is the point of a trailer when it is not out for so long
Why wpuld the apartment complex only be available on gta 6 online ? One of my major gripes with the gta 5 story mode was not being able to buy property
Did somebody forget the dodo in GTA 3? 😮
Will Sheriff GRADY JUDD be in the game to do his wanted announcements?
What if theres no gun stores like GTAV but a guy who sells guns in GTAIV since lucia has a criminal record and cant be caught up again
I’m curious if the Vercetti estate on Starfish island is still there in some form.
The guy with the bandana had to be a gang member... what if he just likes bandanas
4:31 is that supposed to be Ricardo Milos on the left?
is this gonna be on ps4 ?
Im interested to know more about what looks like some sort of mega yacht at 7:27 (top right hand corner of the bay) 🤔
Is the freedom factor on the map??
Are those kids playing in the mud in the background??? 13:51
15:00 Hellcat challenger cop car? (Gauntlet Hellfire)
16:11 Are we assuming the games in the games get sequels more than once every ten years?
Is though Lucia's boy friend was named Jason because we already knew Lucia's name for like almost a year now
So does that mean you gotta play as a woman aswell? 😢
We got a gta6 teaser trailer breakdown before gta6?!
how is wezel news a parody to fox news? im confused all it says is news and that makes it similar to fox news? lol this guy is a bit of a dumbass
how does a black man with a bandana tease asian gangs in GTA 6?😂😂😂
It's sometimes difficult to see if it's real life footage or part of the trailer. Wow!
What if you can actually go to jail for your crimes in GTA 6 ?  THAT’D BE CRAZY! 👀🔥
Is it just me that wants some of the old radio stations to come back for nostalgia purposes. It would be cool if radio channels work in the same way the real world does, based on where you are on the map you're able to pick up certain radio channels.
Why does the voice of the narrator sound just like that dude from the cannabis News Network on YouTube
Isn't the male protagonist named Jason based of the leaks? That's also how we found out Lucia's name as well
is Lucia the only protagonist?  or they’re two and are switchable?
Maybe one day we will get a chance to have stick shift options for cars in GTA
Question is.. Can we, hopefully, bring our gta v online character over to Vice City?
You can’t play male characters?
Anyone notice the green Chrysler 300  srt ? 😮‍💨
Thought 'Running down a dream' was San Andreas?
Why tf you called it a dodge charger when it's clearly a challenger
Who else noticed the "Sunpass or Toll By Plate" on the highway sign?
Yay single mom simulator!!!! Do we get our foodstamps on the 5th every month in game?
5:45 how do you forget the miami heat arena with the pink and teal stripes on the left hand side.
Are those kids in the background wrestling in the mud at 13:51 ???
Anyone else notice the Miami Heat arena when Lucia was going wild on the highway ?
Cool they got a Peruvian & Haitian flag, but no Cuban flags … in Miami (Vice City) ?
Do you think the Sky Wheel from Miami will be in GTA 6
wonder if we can play as the male too?
Why 99? Why not 100??
Isn’t anyone going to talk about the cop scene it’s in first person and looks like we’re going to be able to be a cop in the game
crocodiles?! bro c'mon, they're gators
2:32 a callback to gta 6 roots?
Anyone else think it looks bad?
lol why you pronounce brickell like that?
Is this just cinimatics? Or gameplay?🤔🤔🤔
In the Wezel news clip you can see someone lost their swimming shorts due to a waterspout, could this mean we have full blown weather systems like tornados and hurricanes? We had a Hurricane in the first Vice city, would be amazing to see one fully ramped up in the current gen.
Idk how crazy it sounds but what if "Jason" will be you, like a customizable character.
The scenes at 14:38, 16:54, 17:30 an 18:10 could be all the same (first?) mission, a robbery on the Uncle Jacks store? Same car, same outfits, same bandans same day time.
PiBwasser? That character is pronounced as an S. I think you may have missed a joke!
What's the BGM name during 16:10-16:52?
What about cheat codes
How are any of these "hidden details" when they literally put them in the trailer?
Why is everyone ignoring green Lamborghini at 8:28
will Tommy Vercetti return in GTA 6?
are we sure we are not playing in the real world?
How many characters are playable?
Hold on, theres bermuda triangle on the map???? Ahhh some easters
Maybe Andrew is the president?
why Florida becomes Leonida, weird naming.. 😅
Excellent video. One quibble, though: Tom Petty's "Runnin' Down a Dream" was featured on GTA: San Andreas' K-DST, and not in Vice City. (The song came out in '89.)
Wasn't the dodo in GTA 3 as well?
anyone else think they released a trailer too soon? We gotta wait two moree years now like wtf
What’s to say these are not pre generated?
15:46 Vice Dale is Miami Dade and Leonard is Broward.  I’m guessing Kelly is Monroe/collier mix but I’m wondering if there is gonna be a Palm Beach County counterpart
Would this work on my xbox 360?
Is that a SKY TOWER(middle left) in the opening scene?
broooo they even got the bridges in the keys right. they gots that old bridge right next to the old one just like in real life‼️‼️2025 THO?!?😫😭
Will there be planes in GTA VI?
2025 wonder where I'll be by then.
At the gas stations, you can see the npcs lined up to pump gas… possible fuel mechanic?
Can we talk about even smaller details? Like the sand on the people’s feet at the beach 4:05
Why are PC players discriminated against?
What parts of this preview show the actual gameplay versus flashy looking cut scenes?
Years ? We waited over a decade .
Wondering how much the most expensive edition is gonna be!
What are the PCs minimum specs for gameplay?
Wasn't 'running down a dream ' in San Andreas not vice city?
Only 99? Pathetic
13:51 are those kids in the background playing in the mud??
When are people gonna wake up to this, they are literally showing you what you've ALREADY SEEN and have got 1.4M views from it. Wake up ffs.
Already?? bro the trailer just came out yesterday there is no way you made this video about 99 details about GTA 6 trailer 😭😭
do we have play as the chick?
Will we need better consoles for this game
can someone explain the clips that they are copying around the 10 minute mark?
How do you get 99 details out of 90 secs of a trailer😂😂
The girl at 9:43 is Eva Mendes… Right?
In the Wezel news clip you can see someone lost their swimming shorts due to a waterspout, could this mean we have full blown weather systems like tornados and hurricanes? We had a Hurricane in the first Vice city, would be amazing to see one fully ramped up in the current gen.
This is a reach.. but what if that beware of dog sign is a hint that Franklin is in the game. Possibly in that cop raid mission. Maybe he gets arrested ??
Could arrest Andrew be a reference to the Zimmerman case?
lol why did he pronounce brickell like brick-L? You can tell he’s never stepped a foot there.
8:40 is that a cop driving an aventador?
But where is sprunk? @sonnyevans
This voice is familar sounding??
Why does nobody seem arsed we still have to wait more than a bloody year other than me
Are we not in the 4k universe yet? He keeps referring to it as the HD universe. I'd say GTA4 and 5 are HD universe. We out of that now
How does this look more intricate then gta 5 apart from graphics
So does this game take place like in the 2020’s?
The different coloured maskes both wear while robbing the gas Station. Whats up with that?
Wonder what the soundtrack woll be like
Does anyone know if this is actually in game footage or not...
8:34 DODGE CHARGER!?!?!?
Yall gone break down trailer for the next year an a few months?
Is there even 99 seconds worth of runtime in the trailer?
If you ask me, Leonida is pronounced LEO-NEE-DA. Like Florida is pronounced FLO-REE-DA and not FLO-RAI-DA.
Why nobody noticing the razor/polaris looking vehicle in the mud pit?
2025 though?
So are we playing as a girl?
DID YOU KNOW???: There will be at least 3 different types of guns im GTA VI all of which are confirmed to shoot bullets
Why is it always cali or Florida....  Make one for ny or Philly or some 💩
17:08 pibwasser... really? that is spelled pisswasser, in german it means pisswater... and i'm not even a german to know this...
guys its 2 years away what are we doing with this video
13:50 are those kids in the back?
Where has the yacht at 19:14 come from? Did it go *through* the bridge?
8:36 Why does nobody know the difference between a dodge charger and a dodge challenger? They don’t even look the same.
When’s trailer 2 coming?
One big question: Will there be an honor system in GTA 6 like in RDR2?  After red dead redemption 2 we definitely saw some compatibilities between GTA and RDR. like the epsilon cult and rdr2's mysterious cult.
did any notice Lucia weight change? HMM
Y’all more excited about story mode or online ?
How many protagonists?
Wasn’t running down the dream on San Andreas not vice city?
Why is it in GTAonline a majority of the modders/hackers are in the IGN crew? 🤦‍♂️🤣
Did anyone notice when they kick the door into rob the shop she’s not wearing her ankle bracelet, maybe that’s how the game starts 18:10
Will it run on Steamdeck? 😅
Just a thought but what if the male lead is an undercover cop could make for a very interesting story
8:36 dodge what?
How can this guy breakdown every single thing my goodness.
Pretty sure the Running Down The Dream - Tom Petty song features on San Andreas not Vice City.
Why are we being forced to play as a female is bad enough? We have to make these choices while playing c o d
Are they going with multiple playable characters like in GTA5?
Gotta Love the reality improvement but dude, isn’t it too graphic to take your car and run over all that beach people just like in any other gta ? Idk
Amazing breakdown. Isn't the male character named Jason?
In the states whats the difference between a police officer and a sheriff?
Cuban gang? Haitian gang? You mean bloods and crips? 😂😂
Where's the time stamp guy when you need him
So has there since been any new info on that "dolls of destruction" website that poped up? Is that real/related to the ingame band shirt?
What if........this trailer is just showing us more of Lucia and her partner and a glimps of VC and Leonida.  The next trailer will showcase Jason and more of VC and Leonida.(or whatever his name will be) That would be cool.
8:36 challenger not charger
The detail I'm skeptical about is the social media aspect of it.
You couldn't make it to 100?
What do you mean it's not clear who the bikini girl is? It's Lucia lol plain as day
How did you not note that the liquor store is based off of Flanny’s/Big Daddy’s? Massive Miami Culture.
NO PC RELEASE ARE THEY INSANE?
Why did rockstar make her so fine
Wasn't "Running down the dream" in San Andreas, not Vice City?
5:46 aint that the Heat arena??? 🤔
I’m going to guess that the robbery we see in the trailer with Lucia and Jason is before she goes to jail as she doesn’t have the electronic tag on her leg yet as is shown in the key art. Maybe this is even part of the opening cinematic? It looks to me like all the scenes could be placed together in such a way that they start in the hotel/bedroom and then rob the store only to be chased by the cops and Lucia is then captured in a possible betrayal by Jason being the “bad luck” she talks about. Thoughts? 🤔
Is it just me or does Lucia's partner look a lot like Michael in the trusts scene?
Can anyone tell which edition of gta vice City is this 7;20 ?
Did IGN copycat Strange Man?
Why do we have to wait longer for the PC version though? It's actually not "unsurprisingly", it's highly illogical. Who cares about consoles?
Will they bring Opressor MK2 ?
5:17 isn't that building with RGB the mall from the PSP version of vice city
Can they fix the inflation lol
Does this make it the first ever Billion dollar game?
Do you guys think we will get a hunger bar aswell as a health bar like we do in rd2? Would love to see like a burger shot or some kinda food place where we can eat, also love to see a gym and a strength bar where you can gradually build up from skinny to muscle over time by hitting the gym and fighting
Why are they pretending to not know who Jason is 😂
Isn't the bridge around 9:06 the one used in one movie with J L Curtis and Schwarzenegger about him being super secret spy?
13:56 with the ThrillBilly mud club, you can see children playing to the left of the screen. So does this confirm children will be in the game?
Interesting how you see a cargo ship actually sailing on the ocean, I've never seen that in a GTA, maybe they could be used to smuggle drugs? Or weapon shipments to earn cash
From an audio engineer, when TF will you guys ever turn your audio down.   Like someone talking right into a microphone
Crocodiles??? Florida is known for gators not crocs
Is this map already confirmed? Where did you get it from?
Is this a remake or continuation of the last ?
Why do pc get absolutely shafted
A part of me tells me Niko will be in this game or hinted towards him one way or another, didn’t Lester say he also went to vice city or either died?? One of the two?
where is the map at 3:22 and 5:28 from?
Anyone considered how much Lucia looks like Mary Linton?
why don’t they put real brand cars
how yall got 99 details and gameranx only got 20
isn’t it Sound4Round (Sound Around) at 16:30 ?
Can we fast forward through 2024?
8:36 dodge charger? Its challenger.
They talking like she's the main character, is it not a two character game ?
My question is this trailer actual gameplay or in engine footage or is it pre-rendered cinematics
"Pibwasser"? Really?
Can we see Lionel Messi as he is a player of Inter Miami?
Anyone else see the resemblance between Jason and colt from ghost recon breakpoint?
PS5 and Series X only? No crossgen?
If this time NPC just doesn't spawn and they have their own character route that would be awesome. But the thing is are the hardware in that year ready for this?
When do we get to see gameplay footage ?
Do people really pronounce it PiBwasser? Hilarious🤣
At 2:38, wasn't the Dodo from GTA 3?
What happened to the twerking police
Will the the game fit my PS5 lol?
Did you really pronounce it piBwasser?!
My kids are gonna be like "what was it like in 20s Dad?"  Im literally gonna give them this game.
GTA 6? Sounds like a cool mod for GTA 5
Do we really not know Jason’s name is Jason?
Has anyone call the phone number thats on the pawn shop sign?
Random side note, Brickell, isn't Brick-l, it's pronounced Brick-O
Where’s grove street tho ?😢
why is nobody mentioning that’s there is gonna be ambient lighting features in car customization
Did he just say Pibwasser? Hahah. It's pronounced Pisswasser which should give a hint as to what it means.
Is it me or the guy looks like Tommy?
Would we get a version for the PS4 Slim ?
So is it Jason and Lucia? Switching like in gta V or we don’t know yet
11:11 not sure about the "undercover" nature of that police raid... they do have police written right on their back
30 fps lock and no mods?  meh I'll wait for a normal version
Did anyone notice that Jason looks a lot like Arthur Morgan or niko bellic while he is in the car in that angle or that view 😮
Do guys think we are able to move our accounts over🤔
Is her partner not called Jason?
How many main characters are in the game?
Will we finally get the jetpack we all want
10:17 is it just me or it's ricardo diaz mansion/Vercetti estate on the background?
Do you think this will be 60fps?
Damn how many videos y’all going to milk out of one trailer
Was that someone surfing in the beach scene to the far right when zoomed out ?
Alligators surely no?
How can you find details of a game that still haven’t decided what and how to make it yet
Is lucia the one on the bikini that posed?
Is it me or does the male protagonist resemble Jim Caviezel?
Is it possible for Rockstar to reduce the views over eighteen years old?
How could Michael Mann's Miami Vice be a key inspiration for the original Vice City when it came out years after the game??
Idk how PS5 and Xbox X|S will handle the game smoothly. Next versions (Pro) of the consoles have to come out to play it smooth.
Do we think there will be lots more interior environments?
Why apartment purchase only online? All purchase should be in story mode also
is this a game?
Im wondering if its going to be alot of stuff but nothing  to do vibe that gta 5 had  not being  able to enter buildings  etc
I’m curious if you can go to Cuba
you can see the improvements in graphics when you can't identify which comparison  is real or not
The clip was freaking 1 minute long, how yall seeing almost a 100 Easter eggs????
Maybe the opening gameplay of gta6  is jailbreak in gta5 the opening is robbing
What stopped you at 99?
Why do you think that it's not just a cinematically enhanced version of the game? There is no statement in the video (like they usually do) that everything you see is in-game.
PiBwasser? My guy, that's a German Eszett. It's basically just two Ses. So, it's pronounced PissVasser.
I’m actually curious about the kids in the back of the thrill billy scene on the left. Is there gonna be kids in GTA6 or is it just a scene only thing?
The guns they use in the store in the final shot are interesting. the male guy's gun looks similar to GTA V's basic pistol, but Lucia's appears to have a Glock style gun. maying they remodeled the combat pistol from five to be a Glock?
Co-op??? The theme is "sticking together".
Details is useless in trailer until they show it at the end product
Still can't sync lips Seriously?
If lucia is in jail does that mean if we get arrested we might have to go through a rehab thing if we wanna get out and has to face devier constituency if we break out ?
Im excited about the game but the next thing im excited about is where is the next gta game gonna take place at? Texas? (Since they already have the map model from rd2) Washington? Chicago?
How does that Damn Radio Tower Survive all those Damn Hurricanes? 🤔
15:30 could it be that they’re poking fun at rappers who self snitch in their music? 😂
Let me ask you something; How do you KNOW, FOR SURE, of certain details you're mentioning without proper fact checking? How do you KNOW the prison staff member's name is actually Stephanie and not something else? Who told you this? You can't even read her nametag because of the resolution. Some of these "facts" you're telling us don't seem really factual...
Not sure why we are judging CGI cut scenes but ok....
Still wondering if the female is the main character or if you can choose between them...
Even a 4080 might not be enough to run this in ultra settings.
Wonder how many suicides gta 6 trailer has delayed
Can it run gta VI. is gonna be the new thing 😭
Where are they getting this map from? Is this confirmed?
I’m confused "Florida" does exist in the 3D and HD universe
All of that in depth analysis and you get alligators wrong?
What happened to Tommy Verseti?
Michael Mann’s Miami Vice (2006) was a key inspiration for the original Vice City (2002)? What?
But isn't it render footage so details don't matter at all untile actual game play comes out ??
Why 69 when you can nine-one-nine? Man, I'm in love with GTA VI already, lol.
why aren't there more studios like rockstar? never plahed a bad rockstar gaem
Any news  about the crypto rumor that was floating around a couple months back?
wtf interpolation
Bonnie and Clyde type of story maybe? perhaps there will be split screen?
Who wishes that GTA 6 setting was set back to the 80s ?
Damn, what is Clint doing here? 😂
GTA  story still is in America..I wonder gta 5 types of gameplay with new wrapper..same boring thing
8:37 challenger not charger
13:50 are those kids in the background????
Didnt the leaked gta 6 stuff we have seen months ago, show that we would get two main characters? This trailer kinda proofs that. Lucia and her partner.
Can we get a different rockstar game while we wait 👀
I've never heard the GTA universe refered to as the "HD Universe", where does that come from?
Its a challenger not a charger
When does it GTA VI Arrive to PC?
Where is the oppressor mark 2
is the map you guys keep showing official or a speculated mock up?
8:36 So you just ignored that Lambo?
Bick-el? It's Brickell.
Anyone found Vic Vance yet??? Tommy Vercetti???
Why is weasel news? Akin to Fox News? I’m just curious.
Who else was kind of underwhelmed by the trailer?   Don’t get me wrong, I’m buying the game. Just asking
Curious what will the Npc will be better reactions
Did anyone notice the dodge challenger police trooper ? 15:00
What about GTA X (10)?
15:35  *Missed Detail* How'd you not mention the baby getting grabbed by a gator? lol
99, really?
Why is it that I’m the only one that notices the children in the trailer lol.
