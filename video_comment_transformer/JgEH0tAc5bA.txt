What launch titles can we expect with the new xbox?
Tron legacy trailer ?
How much is it??
Yes, but. Can it read?
Chill bro its just a cooking pot and you are not Hans Zimmer 😀😀 Also did they really ditch the physical button? It was satisfying to turn. I dont think it is a good idea to switch from physical to digital. You can see it in cars. People want buttons not screens.
