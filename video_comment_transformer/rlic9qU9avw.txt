wheres the full live concert
What stadium is this?
Can we appreciate  Jeongyeon giving BODY? WE LOVE BODY POSITIVE AND INCLUSIVE GROUPS!!!
Was this filmed across two concerts?  At the end Jihyo is holding her mic in her hand in the long shots (clearly visible on the screen) but it's in its holder for the close-ups lol
This is from de first concert or the 2nd one?
Nowadays Nayeon always sound fuller i wonder how she practice..
Where's Brazil?
Are we not gonna talk about Momo's deep voice at 1:35???
Who cried as well?
Why Tzuyu personal close cam shot only 3 seconds ?
what's the purpose of headset microphone 😅... blatantly lipsync if they use it
Why doesn't jyp post the Brazil show too?
Singing where?
The thumbnail is giving speculations in JEONGYEON SOLO again ha💚🐶
How many people they were? 😱😱
now why is dahyun the only one that doesn't get glamed up?? her eye make up is missing!!
wich night is this? friday or saturday?
Why JYPE always cut Tzuyu’s part 🫥
What is love? R= Twice. We love you more!!!!💚💛
can we like have a full choreography in vegas?
Every member has full clips, ONLY TZUYU NO 0:57 ... JYPE, Why do you ALWAYS TREAT TZUYU SO POORLY????? 😡
BRO HOW DID THEY SOUND EVEN BETTER THAN THE RECORDING
OMG !!why do I always tear up every time I watch them sing "I GOT YOU" just like when I watch them perform "BE AS ONE" and "ONE IN A MILLION"  all I see are beautiful ladies and I hear their beautiful voices and that song is really beautiful! it never gets boring to listen to i swear.
2:32 Is this a couple of performances combined cause one moment Jihyo is holding the mic and the other she isn't 🤔
Take me back to those 2 days please
Twice are the best greetings from Costa Rica, I love their songs and one question: Could you ever come to Costa Rica? ❤❤❤❤
