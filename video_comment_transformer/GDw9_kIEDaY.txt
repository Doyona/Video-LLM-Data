Hey where's that part when jihyo come through the scene 😭😭😭
Hmm why does this one sound so different than others......
It looks live! Is it live?! There was a point where the voice sang but she didn’t but after a word or two she joined it but also at the same time she did need to have a little break which she did towards the ending of it
is she an angel?
Who loved this song? 🫶🏻
Dunno if she’s bored, nervous or she doesn’t like the song? 😂
Is this really live?
Can you please have Nayeon fill more than 5% of the frame? We are watching the video to see her and not the giant purple backdrop.
How does she have such a beautiful voice??? She’s so stable and perfect
when will we ever get a real live performance without backtrack??
New jeans?
