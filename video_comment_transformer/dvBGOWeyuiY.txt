I thought prices were way down?
Hes trying to pinch penny"s?  And he goes to Disney world......wowza!
He may want to think twice about buying tickets to the forthcoming RUSH reunion tour! The cheep seats (where you can't see or hear anything) start at just-under $200...!
I THOUGHT EVERYBODY WAS SAYING THAT IT WAS EMPTY?
Fox likes big business and not helping the average person, so what's the problem?
Why dad & daughter only? Where are his wife & son? Or i suppose theres an agenda here…. 🍀
Did he get mad enough to return in a frog suit 😂😂😂
Why is this news? Nice family but I don’t get it when news channels do this.
Why play with Disney when you can play with Disnutz
Horrible. What are their profits?
Honestly never been there but I feel it's just hyped up??
Is it worth it
i wonder if theres any way for disney to evetulaly bring the prices down, or is ti just goingt o keep getting worse, how much more can we afford, weve already popped the bubbe, bet wills till go cause we want to make our kids and our inner child happy lol, but its terribly damaging
kendall did ya have fun what was your favorite part ? 'when my daddy broke down crying over his wallet' and mickey danced around him screaming pay up stupid '
Can we please start a gofundme for this poor white family?
How did he get the entire day for 5 for 1400? Something seems off, it cost way more than that typically
Go on a 4-5 day cruise vs going to Disney..
And people keep paying it so why would they drop their prices?? How about stop going and you’ll save a ton of money..
Back in 2017 my ticket was $75 for an all day pass??? Tf is Disney doing? Money laundering scheme?
Is this a joke! This is not news worthy you choose to go to Disney that’s your problem you know the prices prior!!!!! This is so he can get clicks I can’t believe how stupid this is!
Who is our current president? 🍊🫏 💩
So what’s the attraction?
0:38 was that a fart?
I'm not sure where people are getting the money to go to Disney
I mean if you have a problem than why go?
How is this news lol
What is the difference between this video and another video that is Similar to this video..????
I thought Americans were all for capitalism now they're not?
You’re upset about spending $1400 for the day….?  Lightning lane is cheap as hell. This guy wants clicks. Every time we go to a park for our family of four we’re spending 2500 bucks.
Wait, did your wife pinch in with some of the expenses?
I would say people CAN afford it. Ot they’re just running up the credit card (the guy mentioned ‘swiping his card all day’). If not how come there are such long lines? I’d say it’s more like people are foolish to spend that amount of money.
Is there bill was more than my social security check; what a flip in rip off
What was your favorite part? “Seeing daddy swipe his card”
Inflation is insane. How are these children going to afford entertainment in the future esp  with the cost of daily living.
Dude it’s a family of 5…. That’s not had….??? Am I missing something
What rock has he been living under. He got off cheap
Over $200 per person for just a day??  No thanks. We used to go to Astroworld in Houston for $200 a day for 6 people.
people didn't know that going to Disney is outrageously expensive?
Why are you surprised
Why is he complaining if he has and is promoting his YouTube channel on a nationwide show? Like he didn’t use his YouTube money to pay for the day. Also, an annual pass would be way cheaper. But content needs to be made.
I never got why they don't build a subway to the park. In Los Angeles we have one for Universal Studios, for example.
Does this guy live under a rock? Lol
Why keep going? Save the money for your kids college.
Pinch pennies? His idea and my idea of pinching pennies are not the same, he's going to amusement parks and I'm deciding whether rent or power is going to become my personal harasser this month, I like to switch it up so that it stays interesting.
Why are you  whining? No one said you have to go.  No one says everyone needs to go.  Punished? Really? GROW UP.
Way before 2020 that 1400 was enough for almost a week for a family of 4, then it was enough for 3 days and now only 1???!???
Wait till Disney is exposed
Then why go ..stop crying about it..
Where has it gotten better? It's only going to get a lot worse after the BB bill hits it's worse cuts right after the midterms!
How long has this guy been in Florida? Everyone knows that everything here is expensive, especially if it has to do with recreation and stay.
So, if he knew that amount was too much, why go in the first place? He's such a complainer.
How in the hell do that many folks even afford to go and why the hell we so willing to pay these prices
Little girls answer to what her favorite part was just blew me away. Almost shed a tear.
Why people would bring their kids to that have got to mentally deranged
Where have grocery prices gone down? Mine have increased over the last 6 months.
Ngl you went to Disneyland with a family of literal 5 people, how much you thought you was gon spend?
I mean is 5 people and you go eat at a restaurant there? 👀
Wait…. It’s over 150 bucks per person per DAY to get in?
Why is he shocked?
I wonder how much the Micky Ears cost??? 100 bucks???
Did you expect it to be cheap?
Do tips included?
How many rides did they go on?
Is it worth it? ...... Duuuuuh yeah!!! She ain't paying for it, lol ..... smh
1:15 First time? 😂  How is this man older than me 😂😂😂😂
And how much of that day was spent actually on the rides and having fun? Say about 20/30 minutes? More?
So, you went to Disney World, and you didn't know how much it was going to cost you? Really? You're the first adult I have ever heard of who doesn't research costs before going on a vacation or setting a budget.
Complaining about it while you choose to go is rhetorical...they didnt force you to go nor require to be there to have fun  Be outside in the park, go camping, enjoying a walk, those are free!
Then why go? Are you that addicted to a company? Go take a walk down a natural trail, there are literally hundreds in Florida alone, and it's free.
Why going to Disney’s Abu Dhabi theme park may actually be cheaper than visiting Disney World in Orlando? BTW, the Abu Dhabi theme park is the most high tech modern disney theme park in the world.
@2:24 it's gotten a little better...For who!!!
Is this the park where bunch of dudes with beard dressed up as Disney princesses?
Did anyone not know this? I know people that spent 10 K in Disney.
Maybe your tariff cheque will help pay for it???
This the onion?
Why is he shocked??? It was $200 10 years ago when we went and parking was actually more
Under the last administration what about this administration.
Why would you pay to support the enemy.
So Fox hasn’t connected the dots between THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR GOING TO WAR WITH DISNEY, EFFECTIVELY RAISING THEIR TAXES AND PRICES and now having to pass this on to consumers to survive?? Dumb story
For us that have to fly in imagine the hotel cost too and flight
Jesus who the hell can afford that jesus
Did people think it was gonna be cheaper?
Mind you he lives in FL dont they get a discount?
Dad was about 5 seconds from tears from his daughter's response at the last question in the end.
Why is this an issue? $1,400 for 5 ppl is cheap for Disney, that’s a bargain. We were 8 ppl and the whole package was around $2,400 with hotel, this was many years ago.
Maybe don't be poor? What are we supposed to do, throw a pityparty?
How do you think Disney can recover from all the Woke movies and shows you ask ? By charging suckers 1400.00 a day for an over hyped experience , keep feeding the machine suckers .
It,s gotten a little bit better?  Where do you live?
Nice response by the daughter at the end "which was your favourite part?"
How about WWE’s Wrestlemania ticket costing 30k-60k a person 😂
Got better!? Ask trump to demand that Disney reduce prices !
under the last administration??? lol
Who still goes there?….
Parking is not included!?!
Why would you sponsor a woke business
It’s gotten better? Girl get a clue! I’m sick of both parties and their idiocracy!
This guy is a social media pro wearing his Minnie mouse ears.  if it’s so expensive then why did he go on the trip in the first place?
Groceries in the last administrative were expensive but now it's a little bit better?! What are you talking about?!
How do people even afford this!!!!
It’s gotten a little better???? Where?
The last administration? Prices are even more insane now! Whay do you mean they gotten a little bit better, im paying nearly 7 dollars for eggs and seeing 2 extra dollars on all dairy.
Is Fox that bored??? Why tf you go if you wanna just go on the news how expensive it is
Um, how is Disney going to pay for all those DVC properties, if not by the non-DVC guests, who will never, ever participate in anything DVC.
What is the problem ?? If you don't got don't go
...and people wonder why millennials are have 0-1 kid(s).
This guy used those 1.4k as an investment. With 8mil views, how much has he received in return?  Disney is for pleasure. It's not a basic need, so ppl know, before hand, how much they'll need.
Has anyone attended a sporting event lately ? Or musical venue ?
is disney that good?
So the Father never done research prior to the trip? A trip to Disney and it's relationship to financial budget is a topic going back decades. There are countless reviews to read, reviews to watch online, social media feedback and any physical conversation can spark the topic of what to expect for a  budget, even Dave Cheppelle has a joke about "Disney dollars". This is ignorance at best.
Can you imagine what a non-resident would have cost?
Wait…… The cost is the only thing people are complaining about?
This is so dumb! Disney has always been expensive. It's not supposed to be a cheap trip.  Keep focusing on the real American struggle Fox.... families are struggling to pay essential bills and you highlight a well-off family that can afford to take a family of 5 across the country on vacation.
It's an amusement park, are you amused?
So you payed 300$ per person for the whole day? Thats pretty normal and  Euro disney would be 400$ so whats the point @fox?
The young ladies answer of the question of her favorite part really hit me we don't have enough interaction as a family unit anymore thanks to cell phones and social media.
How many trannys were staring down your children?
Why is he on national news for paying for something he knew he didn't want to pay for?
Why is this even news?
“Waiting in the lines was the best part”?  😂😂. The kid is adorable but if the family is reporting it to the news, the price tag obviously took all the fun out of it.
People can’t afford to go to Disney? Why is it so crowded. It use to be fun to go but now it’s just a stressful over crowded mess.
Slow news day? Desperate to get on TV? Someone finding out what everyone else knew already.
Hes trying to pinch pennies ?  He put the trip on youtube and that probably paid for most of it.
While Fox anchor Ainsley Earhardt earns her $12,000 per day, and while Disney rakes in $1400 from one dad for one day, How much does Disney pay its employees?
Why cant California be that cheap. I went to look up how much would it cost for me and my family just for the tickets it came up almost to $2800 just for 2 days.
0:23 What did they eat? 😂
did you think it was going to be cheap?
Where they able to try out Walts  original crack pipe collection?   From 1954?
Did he not check the ticket prices online beforehand?
Why support a business like Disney?   They care less about you or their employees.
How is it still so crowded then??
Should this story be on CNN?
Why???? Why pay that much for it? Just don’t.
Some of the best days out are when it hardly costs  anything, take a kite to a beach with a picnic and your kids will have a lovely day. It's easy to fall into the National Lampoon family vacation trap, but is it really worth it?
Americans and Disney. Is it some form of a drug? because that`s just stupidity.
Where is the story here? Just go on the website and you can see the prices. Disney has been overpriced for years
Why going in the first place?
isn't he a car dealer? his channel grew during covid
Sorry, but surely the family could have researched the prices online beforehand? I think it's pretty stupid to go anyway and then complain about the prices afterwards.
How is average family not being able to afford Disney,  News in 2025? Life must be good here in the Trump administration
No discount to Florida residents?   We go to six flags in NJ and the season pass is perfect, Last  time I took my daughter to Disney was in 2016 and it was expensive.
How are people still able to go ? Clearly, it is a debt trap. The saddest part 😢 is that a lot of children can't afford to go, and it's a place for children to live their fantasy
Doesn’t make sense. Waiting in line up, means they are admitting to many people to enter the park
So maybe have more connection time and skip Disney??
Now, this is not an accusation, but a personal opinion, Disney probably is trying to recover some of the money they lost with snow white
Basically $250 each for a day at Disney including you getting something to eat...which in reality considering how much is there, how is that way too over priced???....- ❤️-
Why would any sane person spend that kind of money at that loony liberal place???
Why are Americans stingy, what's $1400 for a day of fun, come on, a country with the biggest economy in the world.
Uhh he’s not the only person who paid that, so why is this even news worthy 🤔
After all the scandals, do you feel moral to go there with kids and push them more of your money !!??
Why would you take your kid to a company that pushes homo agendas and has had so many pedos working at there parks. You can't fix dumb.
Why is it necessary to go ? 😂😂
What’s the appeal of this place ?? Mickey ?? 😂😂
Why is this on the news?
The question we should be asking is if employees are getting paid more?  how much does it help sustain the local economy?  Also stock holders are investors, many expect a return on profit for the risk they take on investing in this company. These investors are individuals, retirement accounts managed by large institutions etc.
It gotten a bit better? The economy especially small businesses are going to tank due to the trade wars.
To see what?! I went to Eurodisney and saw nothing special! I liked the Moon ride and that was it.
Why so surprised??!!! 😅 must live under a rock not to know and expect it
Things are going down?? Where? Prices are going up on everything!!!
If you are a Florida residence why not be an annual pass holder
Why would you pay $1000 to go for one day and then eat outside the park?
Why are people still supporting Disney???
Why would a parent support that company that sexualizes children?😢
Hold up! Asking a kid without a job if $1400 was worth it is nasty work! 🤣
Why do the people keep going there?? Is the worst place to take children!!
He's a small business owner. Seemed he had the cash to spend. I wonder if he gives his customers a break?
What does he expect? People like him keep paying these prices. Complaining but still paying won't deter companies from charging what they cab get away with.
Do people still go to Disney? I thought we were boycotting anything, Disney?
Is that really News Worthy?  There is an easy solution.  Don't go!
Why would someone be in shock? The prices must be posted somewhere. Foolish.
When have they been cheap? 🤷‍♀️
I thought everything was supposed to be cheaper with mass immigration?
how is this a shock or rather a story? the dude did it willingly paid for it
charging for parking?
Boycott??? Maybe 1 week
Disney was closed the last administration?
So how can all these foreigners afford it with all their kids???!!!!!!
Dad took them there eyes wide open about costs but complains about it afterwards?
Did he ever take his family of 5 to a NFL game?
spending that much money for that fake BS?    i’d rather go to the mountains and enjoy ….
I wonder how much prices have increased for Americans…since Canadians have refused to vacation anywhere in the States. 🤷‍♀️🇨🇦👏
lol it has gotten better? Trump’s tariffs especially with Canada and China is gonna drive inflation higher than anything Obama or Biden ever did.😂😂
As an aside, how relatable is it for most men that the wife is just having a great time and smiling and laughing etc... completely oblivious to the cost of the "fun"; while the husband is just the bank card and thinking how many hours of work it is to pay for all of that.
What was your favourite? His daughter: Waiting in lines bc I got to spend fun time with my family. Dad: 😳
Guess where Disney gets all the money to finance those money losing movies?
WHY WOULD YOU GO THERE ? IT IS OWNED PARTLY BY CHINA. THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE HOMOSEXUALS  🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
Why didn’t he research prices before going? Based on the background and this guy’s shirt, he’s just advertising for his small business. Typical.
How is he pinching pennies? He don't even know what it is to pick pennies spending 1400 for the attraction.
I thought Florida residents could get a yearly pass at a fair price?!
$300 for parking for a day? I have never been charged that at Disney in Orlando
Why is this on the news?
2:15 Under the last administration?
Disney is wondering why attendance is down as prices are so expensive. Find alternative locations is the answer.
He looks like Ron Desantis. lol do they just look like that in Florida or something ? lol
How is this news? He planned the trip right? I assume? He didn’t see any of the cost before hand yah okay… not news
Why would he be shocked? It was prepaid. Did he not look at the checkout cart before purchasing?
Seriously rich people get to jump to the front of lines?
They make it so unaffordable for Americans who live paycheck to paycheck why?
Does Disney advertise on Fox?   hmmmmmmmm
What about the wife ? Why wasn’t she helping with the bill
Disney gives you fun. You give Disney $. What could go wrong?
Have you tried buying food lately? Is this a distraction to take away our attention from the fact we can't afford to eat?
How about going camping ?? Taking a car ride somewhere.
Why wear the ears after being ripped off? I don't feel sorry for them.
Why is anyone still watching FOX?
Some of her questions are oddly worded.
What’s Disney?!
Why isn’t Fox News calling him out for not doing enough research before the trip?
You'd think with what they charge they could at least pay their employess a livable wage
Is this performative or did he really not know it's expensive?     People like him will ke err p going, he'll just whine about.  Saying no to his wife is not possible, and he cant teach his kind the value of money and you dont need overpriced trips to be fulfilled.
It’s gotten a little bit better?? Lmao she knew she messed it and fix it quick. 😂
😂😂🤣 why people still going there ???  They know before they go there that is expensive.
Soooo outrageously expensive, Yet the park is still packed. If the ticket is $50 a person, wouldn’t each line be 4 hour wait? Not saying that they should charge so much…. Just for thoughts
OMG, the absolute fools willingly feeding the money machine to perpetuate its existence??  SMFH…😢
Has this guy been living under a rock? It's been expensive for a long time, buddy.
for real? did he not research?
How is he shocked?  He paid for every item in the vacation.
Lmao sooo who forced you?
How much did you pay for them goofy looking Mickey mouse ears???
Yo is nobody in this comment section going to mention his daughter’s favorite part was talking to her family while waiting in line for a ride? That was so unexpected and choked me up.  Goes to show how far brain rotting is going in social media 😂
Id like to take my son to Disney. Hes never been and his 10th birthday is on July 2nd. Any tips?
How is it getting better under this administration? Show me one good example... please, I'll wait 😅 and stop blaming corporations like Disney when they are just playing the capitalism game
Disney has to increase the costs because of lack of tourism...did you think it would be cheaper??
Why u put ur kid in woke land and pay 1400 usd too?
How many  rides did you actually  get to ride.
Didn't this father check beforehand how much parking, ticket cost, etc. would cost? You don't have to be a genius to know that food bought at these theme parks won't be cheap. That's poor planning on his part. If you're going to be shocked by how much you have to pay for a day at an amusement park, then maybe you should take your family somewhere else
Did a Disneyland day pass back in '86,from memory think it was $50.
a day pass should be around $40 per adult food around the same price
Make you wonder how much of the money is given to staff at Disney?
They don't call it Di$ney for nothing.  Was he truly surprised?  Did he do any research?
Can you imagine the anxiety in the parents after paying so much money and having to pretend they enjoy the day in front of their kids?
Shocked? Dude did no research
And how much would he pay to take a family of 5 to a professional sporting event for a few hours?   Or a play by a traveling Broadway play?  Or Universal Studios theme parks? About the same these days.
Why are they charging for parking
Y not just fly to another country?
Costs have gotten better under the current administration?!  Hardly!
This guy didn't buy any food or gifts at the park? You can tack on another $400-$500 for this alone. I did the 50th anniversary of Disney with my sister (we're both women in our 40s) with no kids and the week alone set us back about $12,000
Does that come with a refund for paying to see SNOW WHITE?
They live in FL. What abt the folks who have to travel to get there. Now you are factoring in air fare or a long car trip and overnight stays.
How about 134% tarif, thanks to ......
Wow, that's costly for a day? You think it would be abit cheaper. For a day pass, you think their would be a limit on ppl so you can get on as much rides as you can. I know they probably spent alot to make Disneyland so I can see why it's abit pricy.
Why do people even want to go to Disney world?
For Disney in CA, the parking is even more expensive, and that the video is not even counting the snacks, desserts during the day and lunch?! This is not the total price.
Are people still surprised at how expensive it is? I mean this isn't anything new, this has always been the case, where even back in the 90s, many would have considered a trip to Disney as too expensive (a reason my family only went once a year even though we were only half an hour away). Add in that even though it's expensive, many are still more than happy to pay the extra cost, thus giving Disney no reason to reduce prices.
I went to Disney land in Tokyo for $50. I  then paid for fast track as much as I could which was an additional $30? and then I ate food there which was probably another $30? I went by myself 😅😅😅
If most families can't afford Disney why is it so packed?
So what? Try buying a rolls Royce. These are luxury purchases that are expensive.
But he decided to spend that, why is he complaining lol?
Figuring out the cost per ride (including some of the non-ride features) per person, really puts things into perspective. Is it worth it?
Isn’t it like 20 dollars for a water bottle at Disney world ?
Prices are getting better than the last administration? Faux news spinning their spin once again.
What I want to know is, how much money did he make off of the YouTube video???
Wanna know how you save $1400 next time Dad tell your daughter no 😂
Who buys the tickets at the gate really
What does a round of golf cost ? For how many hours ? For the entire family ?
Tell me why Disney is worse now
It’s gotten better with this administration? Is she on coke?
Why would anybody even want to go?  You could pay a fraction of the price and go to cedar point! Better rides more rides shorter wait times. Overall better experience
If that's the price for Florida residents, how much are tourists paying?
Got a little bit better?! 😂 Nice save there Fox.
Did he think that it was free?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why is he acting surprised? Sounds about right. Just stop going lol
Isn't he Craig, the YouTuber car dealer from New Hampshire (Flying Wheels)?
How could he not know???? Everyone in the world knows it is expensive. People plan months in advance to do packages to save money.
I have a six year old grandson who asked about Disney world. I told him it was closed and we were going to go see some great waterfalls nearby.
$954 dollar tickets for a family of 5 with access to 4 different parks sounds reasonable to me. Unless I'm missing something?
asking a kid if its worth it..... kid has no concept of money... never worked a day in her life.... brain dead question fox.
Maybe don’t take your kids? Lmaoo 🤷🏻‍♂️
Why would you not calculate the cost before you go?
This is news? They could have done this story on my family back in the 90s - when Disney costs were lower, but so were salaries. We took our kiddos to Disney once - they have great memories.
Disney pls I have six kids and I don’t know if I can afford to come there with my kids if this cost is too expensive lol
Has he been living under a rock for the last 20 years?
And it was packed. But I thought everyone was broke?
KIDS? IN THIS ECONOMY?! In a time when everything cost a lot, who would have guessed having 4 kids/a 6 person family would cost a lot to do anything 🤣🤣👌👌
What is the best thing about the trip? The time spent with my family!❤
And you wonder why so many people have personal debt.
I thought Felon47 was going to reduce prices on everything!? What am I missing?
Who pays this for a woke horror show?
Why would anyone subject ourselves to this overpriced torturous endeavor? Is this the first man that has ever calculated his costs? You could not drag me to Disney and it's woke idealism. 🤔🖕
@ 2:22 Why turn this into fake news?
Did he not realize it is really expensive to go there?
He’s trying to save money (pinch pennies), so he went to Disney?
What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
Did he not know the prices before he went? We have not been in 5 years because of their crazy pricing even as a Florida Resident
Just for a day trip???? Bye
Disney is all about fairness and equality right ? How come they offer people with more money a better experience ? You pay all that money then you stand in line like a herd a cows waiting to be milked watching the privileged cut the line. They could'nt pay me 1400 to go there.
How did he not expect that cost?
5 kids, wudyaexpect??
He didn’t plan accordingly. $200+ for dinner? Could have had turkey legs and saved. Also bring snacks from home. I did the same trip for like $700
Why would you buy tickets at the gate?
How is this news? Who actually thought Disney was some bargain vacation?
With mountains of people in lines paying tickets and low wages to the employees, where does the money go?
What price for a warped, distorted irreality- and woke too?!
Is this the Onion?
Ask a child if it was worth it. How the hell would she know, she didn't work for that 1400.00 dollars.
GURL!!!!! What has gotten better???  Yall lies!!??  The last Adminstration spent time cleaning up what the "last" Adminstration messed up.  The Repubs always have us STRESSED!!!!!   Lying Lady!!!
What would happen if Walmart charged for parking.
Why is this a story? We literally have people going to food pantries and we’re talking about how expensive Disney World is… GTFOH. Disney World has always been expensive.
How is this news
Where do y’all think Bob Iger’s compensation comes from? $41 million a year. Not going back to Disney anytime soon, sorry
Can you sneak in your own food from mcdonalds??? I mean why would you want to pay that just for food for a burguer???😂😂😂😂😂
Who asked you to go there?
What? Daddy didn’t look at the prices before hand?!  Poor daddy.  Spent all that $$$.  What a hatchet job.
Aren't the prices posted on line?  I assume you would look into prices beforehand and consider the cost before going.  If it's too expensive do something else.   I can't believe they are complaining about expensive theme park trips.   Good grief.
What are they talking about? Disney World has been expensive for the past 20 years or so.
How is this news?
Where has this guy been?
That isn’t that expensive for a day for a huge family……how is this news?
has dad been living under a rock?
Would universal be cheaper?
What??? The.... F..
Talk about fleecing an already under fire public trying to get at least a trip of a "lifetime". You have to ask if it's actually "worth it?". Everybody's looking to get a bargain at the end of the day but I don't think "Disney" got the memo.
Dad didn't look up the prices before going there?    Doing anything with 5 people isn't cheap.   Try paying for 5 escorts in Vegas for your friends.
For a day? Universal in Japan I only spent 300 total a day! And it’s better than there..
The kid wouldn't wear the ears? She knows she's a little girl right? YouTube deletes comments violating 1st amendment,
Have you considered having more kids
Why is someone complaining about paying this price news?? If you have 1400 to pay for fun your not PINCHING PENNIES
$1400? That's a week at Ocean City.
What would cheapskate donny two dolls do? Leave Eric and Tiffany outside and get Melaniea to pay for Barron.
Its gotten a little bet better!? Its worse than ever.
The dad is really cute. Does this include a hotel stay?
Why cover the name of your YouTube channel with your head?
People couldn't afford groceries under the last administration and now it's better?? Is this really a news channel???
What parking is not included with the park ticket? or am i missing something
Why not take the bus?  Also, how many parks did they have access to for the day?  Should be snacks & fast food on site, then eating at a restaurant off property.
How can you put a price on a family day no one will forget?
None of this is a surprise though…you can look up the prices….why is this news?
Why would you go when you know it’s overpriced? Then cry about it 😂
Why do they keep going?
Cost of living is now better??? Lmao
What do u expect though?
Under the last administration?
I wonder how the foreign Disney parks compare in pricing terms.
Is he Ron's brother?  He looks just like him.
Did he not check pricing beforehand? What was he expecting 😂
I don’t get why people love these mediocre parks with hardly any good thrill rides. I’m wondering if Disney has to price people out so that the parks aren’t over crowded more than they already are.
Why are people still doing this crap?
Let me guess.  There is a gofundme already set up.
Is that just for a day?!?! That price should be what you pay when you spend a week in the park! Dang!!! It has become so ridiculous!!!
He’s trying to pinch pennie’s yet taking the family to Disney? Any adult wearing Minnie Mouse ears can’t be taken seriously. Ever
Why would they charge less, greed runs deep.
Did he mention how much the hair band was?
If u live close to Disney might hv to just get a seasonal job or hv ur child get one so u can get in for free
Why pay to go into a giant merch mall??
How was the cost a surprise to him? Every line item could have been researched ahead of time.
What was the cost of Disney 30 years ago?
Want to know how to fix this??? Stop supporting places like that. Boycott them, and watch how quick they lower prices and still make millions
Who tf still goes to disney?
HEY WHY DOESNT SOMEONE ASK TRUMP TO TAKE THE TARIFF MONEY HE HAS COLLECTED AN START BUILDING FACTORIES HERE IN AMERICA TO MAKE THE THINGS WE WAS GETTING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
What makes “this” Dad so special?
Why would he be in shock ,if he did his research he would had known ,apparently it wasn't that big of shock ,THEY STILL WENT😂
Why do people keep going to Disneyland?  As long as the share holders see that people are paying those crazy prices the more they'll keep hiking them up.
So how about souviners
never understood why people go to these places. paying 1k to do what? walk around?
$30 for parking? It’s more expensive here in California with DLR/DCA, where parking is $35!!!
Oh my word….why?  Isn’t this place supposed to be a place for everyone to enjoy. You know Walt is shaking his head.
How do you think they keep making movies like Snow White.
Were they born yesterday? Why is this news
What is the obsession with the plastic mouse?
Really?  It’s freaking Disney and he didn’t think it would be expensive?
I wonder if season passes would be worth it if you lived nearby. I live near a 6 flags and I got season passes. It was a lot of fun the first like 10 trips but now it's not so great unless I take somebody with me. I'm forever alone though. Haha.
Is going to Wokeyland still a thing?? 😐😐
Why the hell is Craig from flying wheels on Fox?😂
Asking the child who hasn't contributed a cent if it (the cost) was worth it. Wow, great reporting...
Shouldnt cost more than 15$ per child maximum. 1400$ you can have a private kids party at home with mascots, magicians and music and food and so much more
If you are going to attend the park, why make you pay to park?  And $30.00 just to park the car?
Wait...he didn't know it's expensive?
What’s wrong did it take money away from you getting another stupid hat
I wanna know what profession the dad is in to spend like that.
Wow, what kind of mickey mouse operation is this joint?
Disney it appears has been fleeced by the culture of GREED. I seriously wonder how Walt Disney, the founder for the benefit of family and children feels about this looking down???
I thought prices are coming down. What's the price of a cup of coffee at Trump Tower?
Only $30 for parking?  Disneyland is at least $50.
Who still likes Disney?
How else will they pay for their Black SnowWhites?
How can that place still be so packed? How are all these people affording it?
I’m shocked that he is shocked by the cost. He didn’t know this already?
why is he complaining about being able to afford Disneyland?
How have groceries gotten better?!?  This is an actual video about the outrageous current price of things!   Current costs
Give me a break; the cost is NOT STAGGERING.  The same amount of money in 1976 would be $211.  Why are Americans becoming tightwads with some things and $10 for coffee at Starbucks is OK?  Plus this guy looks like DeSanctimonious Junior
Haven't been to Disneyland since 1988!!  Does anyone know how the price compares to Knott's Berry Farm, Universal, or Six Flags?
Maybe he should do some research on the costs before he actually goes there?  Then he wouldn’t be so “shocked”.  🙄🙄. So tired of people bashing Disney.   🙄🙄
Why do we still deal with Disney - I have 4 kids and I have stopped going there - it is crazy!
$1,400? I spent that much today, it was on prescription glasses… and it was two for one deal
Pay for grooming?
Aren’t they always expensive 😮😅 ?
He's from FL, did he think it was free?
So, what's the solution? Disney is already very expensive, yet it still attracts huge crowds every day. The lines are long, and if prices were lowered, even more people would likely go. So what should be done?
Does anyone remember E tickets?
Hmmm i wonder why💀
Is Mr. Stowell living under a rock?! The sky-high pricing has been happening since the scamdemic. Bob Iger World pushed me out the door financially FIVE years ago. I called and tried to book a trip and couldn't believe it was over $1,600 for air fare, lowest price level hotel and basic tickets. Cancelled everything and did something they would not like: I called their enemy Universal. My god, the price difference was like night and day...
Also...I assume that Florida man gets the discount for being a Florida resident...so that may have been a discounted rate?? Whoa.
Relatable? Pinching pennies? People pinching pennies don’t go to Disneyland. He obviously knew what kind of money he needed to have and he had it. People are willing to pay so of course it’s expensive. This is ridiculous
Is this a surprise? C’mon. Anyone shocked is living in a very narrowed world.
How about those Mikey ears?
So what do you reckon trump can fix this l doubt it a billionaire is only for himself and the wealthy trumps tariffs are going to break everyone it has only just begun
I wonder what Walt Disney would think if he saw his greedy his amusement park has become?
Trump hasn't fixed it yet? 😂
What would Walt say?
This guy has 3 kids?????
That averages to about $275/ person for the park, plus snacks, drinks and two meals...  Maybe don't buy $12 beers and $50 entrees???  Bet he dropped over $2K on Taylor Swift tickets for the wife and kid without blinking.  His YouTube channel must need a bump so he went Anti-Mouse instead of pushing used cars.
Trying to remember when I started boycotting Sleazy 🤔... '03? Pure satanic evil.
Is anyone really surprised???
It makes you wonder if the lines are so long so that you DO buy the "Lightning pass".
How is this news?
Why is this even on the news? My tap back in 2019 trip to Disney qas over $1200 for my family of 4. Nothing new. Disney have been expensive since forever.
A cruise for a week, or a day at Disney.     Hmmmm.
I remember Disneyland ticket books were 24.00 then they went up to 27.50, now ? gasp 😮
Didn't the dad research prices before going.  He knows people say it's expensive. Theres information online.
I remember buying annual passes for my kids  for many years .the premium pass at 389.00 then to 669.00 with no blockout dates parking included and discounts at restaurants and stores at the Anaheim park .But the same pass is now 1789.00 per pass with blockout dates and reservations needed . Why?? Corporate greed
They should cut DisneyWorlds CEO Bob Iger annual salary of 41 million so more people could afford tickets.
Wait. So you pay just to get in then pay for rides separately??
Do we not do research before we go to amusement parks, especially spur of the moment. Don't get me wrong, that is a lot of money. But everyone knows amusement parks and their amenities are very expensive.
why would anyone go to a disney theme park? i guess they enjoy spending way too much and standing in line for hours.
Why are there no baritones or basses anymore? All I hear is tenors and higher.
Lines? I thought Disney said they're getting rid of lines.
What did he expect?
Little girl, what was the best part?  That daddy was paying for it...
What I can't understand is how that place can be so packed when it's that outrageously expensive.
Can anyone recommend more affordable theme parks in Florida??
If you're spending that kind of money in the first place why are you complaining?
how much does it cost to go to the Movies? 5 tickets 60.00 dollars. 2 popcorns and 5 sodas and some candies. another 60 dollars.
Family  friendly?
Stop asking the kid about the cost.  She doesn’t care about his whining and had a good time.
Who the heck would go to disney
And you wonder why tourists are avoiding travel to the US and Disney related stuff.
200 dollars for tickets?? For the day??  In 1990, they were 31 dollars...
Is that inflation or is something else going on?
Why is he in shock, did he not not see the cost as he was signing for everything, that’s stupidity on his part.
For a day trip?
1,400.00$ for about 200$ in value!?!
How many kiss go missing at Diseny every year?
I still can’t believe people actually get loans for/to go vacation, omg! Is it really that bad? I thought you vacation because you got and can afford it
Nothing is cheap these days!  Did he have a good time?  Did he make his family happy?  Because that's what counts!   Stop bitching about costs in front of the family because your killing the vibe
He didnt check it out before he went? He couldve saved that money.
$1,400? That’s almost the cost of a trip to the grocery store!
Can the Dad use Google?  You can research this ahead of time so there are no surprises.
Does Disney accept EBT and SNAP cards?
Why pay that much to see the same old rides over and over again?
In interesting question to pose to the 3 kids: would you rather go to Disney or have $450 cash in your pocket to spend on what ever you wanted?
What is Disney’s justification for doing this to customers.   People should ABSOLUTELY boycott this place.  It’s not like they are short on customers.  Really a lousy way to run this place.
If most families can’t afford to go to Disney, then why is it still so packed?
How long of your day did you stand in line for that day?  Go to the beach, Florida is big explore all of it , probably will be cheaper!
Better under this administration? Are you Delusional? People are losing their jobs left and right! Can you just report the truth for once?
Was he told to wear those female ears.
How are avrge ppl supposed to pay that for a day out on top of everything else?.
Was the food any good? To expensive
Only $1400?  Closer to $2000.
With pedophilia linked to Disneyland employees why would you take your children there?????
A few things. Did he not research the cost prior to planning this?  If you average the Total Cost Per Person it is not that much.  Yes, it is high to go anywhere these days..
Thought about a florida AP?
I wonder if Mickey pander Minnie, how much would that be?
Wow, $1400., rides, food, etc. What was your favorite part?. Uuhhh, standing in line.😮
It’s gotten a little bit better? Where?!
How to find a better place than going to Disney
What the hell did he expect?
Anybody out there remember the coveted  E-ticket? I think you got two in the booklet, so you had to make them count 😅
why would anyone encourage Disney in the first place is beyond me .....
Needs or wants moment  Is it worth it? Guess either it’s too expensive to family chat while waiting in line or just a dumb answer 😮
He probably spent his tax refund money and if I believe let's see if you're a parent of a child or two or three children let's say you get 3500 back from the IRS per child so if he's got two children that's $7,000 minus give or take 1400 he'll still have enough money left what is he crying about from the child tax credit what is he crying about.
There are many ways he could have cut his cost. Did he try any? Yes Disney is expensive. Do extensive research before you come. There are many websites that can help. Chat with a Disney rep. All you have to do is search, saving money on my Disney trip. Spend your money wisely.
What about airfare and hotel for out of towners
So the dad’s acting as if this is some big shock/surprise?
The mouse got everything but @n@L, or did he?
I don't think $1,400 for five people is outrageous.  Did he think it would cost $200?  Come on now.
I wonder 🤔 what it cost 💲 to stay for a weekend on Disney property and enjoy the park?
But have you said thank you once?
Why is the father taking his kids to woke Disney?
$975 for 5 tickets? And some were under 10 years old? $30 bucks just to park? What a rip off
What is he complaining about? Did he not to any research to see what it would cost? He complains about the cost but he went any way. Typical Karen complaining what is really his choice.
WHY would you support a WOKE company???
$245 at a restaurant in DS?  You got off easy.  Must have been the equivalent of McDonalds.
anyone figure the total?
