Am I the only one who thinks Karina looks a bit similar to Nayeon in this?
Is this heaven?
Karina…..  why are you a pro in everything ❤❤❤❤❤
25:21 When the stethoscope was in the "ears" of the mic, why did Winter find that so funny?  Because Karina's heart beat would be heard through the earbuds.  I get the funny about Karina not having hers in, and why she wasn't hearing it, but Winter was acting like the placement of the stethoscope was wrong?  Did I see this wrong?  Was the Eng subs not really accurate?
Why is there bg music in an same video

12:21 The way she just looked at them like “Is this a joke 😒?” 😭😭

Is there training involved to ASMR? I'm not convinced that Winter and Karina passed Certification to be therapists

Did Karina learn Crayon Shin-chan's mimicry from Chaehyun?

the "idol doing ASMR" concept is amazing but is the "making them do cringy stuff" also part of the concept? I'm genuinely curious since it seems so outdated to me

Hello :) I have a question for the Korean-speakers/Korean-culture experts - what is a modifier? I think it’s the third question they get asked, and I wasn’t able to follow
I wonder if they're going to do this kind of stuff when they retire
21:04 Ship name for the both of them? 21:11 21:23 JI-MIN-JEONG CROSS!
