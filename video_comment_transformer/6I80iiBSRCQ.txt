Again, I wonder which country you unjustly bombed and came to. The rights of the people you unjustly killed in this world will haunt you. America, England, France, Germany, these countries were masters of colonialism and plunder.
Jesus whats the max altidude of these plane? Are all Fighterplanes able to fly that high? 8:08
that song right at 3:25... i like it anyone knows it? please tell me
It makes one wonder why the Euro fighter wasn't made carrier capable. Perhaps the UK wanted the Americans to have the only kids on the block.
How much altitude is that 😮?
What Altitude is this in most of the shots above the clouds?  You can see the spherical curve of earth,  Absolutely Amazing!
Love this ❤ plz tell me background music
I am Spanish, why did no one tell me when I was little, when I was about 12 or 13 years old, that with effort and dedication I could become a fighter pilot? Now at 30 it's too late and it makes me sad.

I can’t even tell is this is a video game or not. Hard to tell lol
Absolutely love the chillout videos🙏🏼. Anyone know who made that remix of “reminds me” near the beginning of the video?
what game is this?
What is these long ropes between navy aviation and plane?
is this sky black or they are in space!?
so these planes wings dont fold, so they just take up a s hit ton of space on the american ship?
seen any cool UFOs?
Where can buy this spectacular game?
Curious to know if the Rafale has ever participated in an exercise vs a stealth fighter like F-22 to see how it performed vs it? Or is it a moot point it'll lose as it cant detect them and they'd lock on it BVR and leave without these guys knowing they were there.
What's the name of that first song ? Can't find it ....
Is the begining a game scence or real life?
what camera is this? so clean! I thought it was video game in the beginning .
Anyone else noticed the beautiful planet visible from 13:30  I think that's Venus 🤔
Is more luring but God's sky.
Hello, can airplanes fly outside of this world? It's just that it can't escape the gravity of the world, that's all.
Does anyone know the song from 3:25?
Could an aircraft video be a masterpiece of art?ıt seems so...
The video is pretty good, but none 4K ?
