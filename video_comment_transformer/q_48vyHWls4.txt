So very good! Ed Sheeran is awesome. There is a part in the chorus where the instrumentals take over, is this a sample of Persian music? It sounds like it may be Persian instrumentals to the tune of Irish music, too. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's very nice. Love the music video.
Who is Azizam 😂😅
The million dollar question is why would he finally sing a song with word that came from out language but still thank you very much ed sheeran i have listened to your other songs now i know your a trusted musician like the others. thank you 🎉

All day Persian weddings! Amazing how Persian language is coming up! Chetori? Khoobaaaam!
Is there anything the west won't steal from us?
Why was there not a Persian stanza in this song? One word has more no significance then if he used "mi amor" or "habibi". My point is, if you're going to do something, do it right.
I've been listening for almost three hours, but I don't know why the music won't end.
