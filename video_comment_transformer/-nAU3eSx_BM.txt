NO BUT I'M HALLUCINATING BBC IS SPREADING VERY SERIOUS DISINFORMATION. TLEMCEN HAS NEVER BEEN A MOROCCAN IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE MAGHREB AND ABDELMOUMEN EL KOUMI IS AN ALGERIAN NATIONAL HERO. TLEMCEN MADAME IS A CITY OF THE ZIANIDE AND ABU QURRA WHO WAS THE MASTER OF TLEMCEN AND ALGERIA WHILE THE MOROCCAN?S WERE INVADED BY THE IDRISIDS. TLEMCEN WAS THE CAPITAL OF ALGERIA. GIVE US THE NAMES OF THE MOROCCAN WHO GOVERNED TLEMCEN, YOU ARE DISHONEST ???? AND ON WHAT DATE????
what do you think of a clown sent by the dictatorial regime ignoring international rights, and violation of a Kingdom rooted in history the oldest Kingdom, even before its native country was a country, moreover Algeria is not a country until then, so leaving the whole world to voice the ignorance of this clown. but that's the world of aliens 👽 👽 👽 👽 they appear then they disappear !!!!
The BBC lies in any language, and Arabic is no different; Rachid Nerkkaz has never claimed that the Koutoubia was Algerian, but he affirmed that it was built by Abdelmoumen an Algerian leader who formed an alliance with his Moroccan counterpart Ibn Toumert, when they adopted  "the concept of divine unity" that led to the establishment of the Muslim Berber khalifat t of Al Mohad, which ruled over the entire Maghreb region and Spain in the 12th to the 13th century, so why on earth does the British Bullshit Corporation continue to  lie unabated, they have no shame whatsoever? No wonder the entire world is disgusted by their deceiving methods of propagating lies on an industrial scale 24/7. But fortunately, humanity has been shocked by the BBc's pivotal role in the still ongoing genocide in GHAZZA, and is now witnessing the BBC's promotion of enmity and antagonism between Morocco and Algeria for the benefit of the BBC's  genocidal masters, despicable.
هل تم توظيفك من قبل بي بي سي للعمل مع بي بي سي العربية؟ إذن لا بد أنهم يائسون من الحصول على جمهور عربي يستمع إليهم! أتمنى لك حظاً سعيداً !!! Are you hired by BBC to work with BBC arabic news? Then they must be desperate to get arabic audience to listen to them ! Wish you good luck !!!
