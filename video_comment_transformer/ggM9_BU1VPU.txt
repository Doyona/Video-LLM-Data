Solar powered water feature perhaps? No wiring required.
wait i don't wanna hate or anything, but why do i hear "us girls" constantly coming outta a mans mouth? i am confused. like ME girl, i have backpain for life cos of my big titties, monthly menstrual cramps with mood swings, weight gain and whatnot AND am currently restless at night can't lay or sit cos i am carrying a baby in my belly. hmmm. no hate tho, just don't like the choice of words.
Is it the tan? Why do you look so 🔥🔥🔥🤩
Can we discuss how much nicer is Ryland's hair now that is longer??
What’s the name of the hardwood store he was at with all the little kitties
Is Shane on ozempic ? He looks good !
Can you be that rich from YouTube?
Why don’t you buy covers for your outdoor furniture to protect them from the sun? Then you can indulge in the expensive furniture you prefer ❤️
Ur a Swiftie and ur supporting Kanye? The math aint matching? Love the patio tho!
Whats up with the camera quality!
Bestie no offense but who edited this vid ....
What’s the details on the hanging lights with a timer and the table?
What doesn’t Ryland know how to do? He’s like the perfect husband, always caring for his home and family! Shane is a very lucky guy ❤
Did you sell the Colorado house?
Does Anyone know the song that starts at 2304 in the background
It’s been awhile for me is this the same house they showed 2 years ago? Or did they move again
Ryland I love you sm sweet baby child, why are you carrying your dolly? lol.  it is literally made to make your life easier and not have to carry things sweets 🤦🏻‍♀️ you are lucky that you’re so pretty 😂😂
I’m a sucker for string lights, can we see the outside at night pretty please!!!
Are the babies teething?! Check their gums, they may be trying to cut a tooth. Teething is for the birds.
Am I the only one that noticed the random person standing in the drive way at 27:24? I can’t tell if that’s Spencer lol
How are your Alpacas doing? I think of them often 😂 such cuties
why does Ryland sound Irish at 8:47
When did you start adding these awful tiktok  sound effects to every little thing ? Please go back to when you didn't do all these SFX.
pls pls pls stop with the clickbait titles we’ll still watch just tell me it’s a patio makeover sis lol
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT TYPE OF SPIDER THAT IS??? I’ve been seeing them around lately
Wait the Yeezys are just straight up jazz shoes with boot spats 😂😂😂😂
Your breakfast looks so good ❤ can you give us more videos of what you eat in day I love it 🥰 anything you post it great love the SIP as well 💗💗💗💗
Ryland how in the hell do you get time to do so much 😂 my baby was born 20 days after your twins and the struggle is real. I'm happy if I can make dinner 😅
Does Shane ever do something? lol 😅
how does the couch not mold from the rain? & thats a little ridiculous for the pricing to be $500 these corporations scam us daily
I don't know if your cats go outside but Lillies are very toxic to cats, even the pollen.
This is no shade but what classifies someone as trending because I swear I’ve watched videos that get more views in a day then this? So?
Spring Cleaning? I think we’re past Spring Ryland 😂
i’m curious if they know lillie’s are toxic to cats, i don’t remember if there cats get outside tho 👀😭
Ryland are you still editing your own videos? Or Shane or someone else you hired? Sounds effects on point 😂
WHY DO YOU PUT IN ALL THE AWFUL SLURPING/FOOD NOISES! ITS DISGUSTING AND TRIGGERING TO PEOPLE WITH MISOPHONIA!
I need to know who that is in the background at 27:25, pls and thank you :)
You didn't look at the yeezy pods size guide?
Does Ryland still have the catio he built? I haven’t seen it lately?
27:25 Who’s that random person with their arms crossed in the background?? 🤨
Quick question.. not sure if he mentioned it.. but is Ryland living outside this summer?? 😅😅🤣
I have been off youtube for a bit, so haven't been keeping up too much, do they still have a plan of going back to colorado? I loveee that house
Can you please show the patio when its all lit up at night time?
How's it feel to be so wrong about the summer-berry starbucks refresher? (The coconut milk one can go to hell)
Do people call mulch “bark?” I was so confused about what was being installed until I saw it 😂
maybe look into WHY yeezy is so cheap rn..
IDK if you have a steamer but you can steam the wrinkles out of the umbrella.
Did Shane loose a bunch of weight or is it just me ?
Why would you mentioned Drake in your SeatGeek ad? 😅😂😂😂 lol I know I know, this might’ve been filmed before.. but that coincidence lol
skipped the starbucks part......... slow news there?
Ryland I love your videos and I watch every single one as soon as you post it. Could you please cut out the slurping and swallowing sounds. I have Misophonia and I am sent into a fit of rage every time I hear those awful slurping and swallowing sounds. I think you might even be adding them in. Could you please just not add those? Or take them out? Please ❤
Does anyone else feel that Ryland is surprisingly very strong? The way he carried away that huge table all on his own was so impressive 💪
How can you own three dogs and two cats and not know how toxic they are to pets?
Love u guys but Starbucks?🍉
I live in Scotland so we obviously have no need for pools in our 24 mins of sun a year but…is it safe to be in the pool whilst you clean 😬 I love the decorating videos, you always nail it
spray paint the horse instead of actaul paint?
Not the hair dresser trying to see if he’s a singe straight man
Ryland do you actually define as a gurl?
Didn’t Shane do a conspiracy video that showed us how Trader Joe’s is literally just Walmart shit with a different label
Who's standing in the background at 27:24 ?! That scared me 😂
Ryland the outside part it looks okay after the reveal but the tiles look so dusted and I think if they had a polish to really show the color it would go a long way
5:38 Why no one talking about Shane getting excited about the Yeezys and Ryland quickly trying to defuse waking the babies up🤣🤣
Are we buying starbucks still????
Where's Shane's tiger shirt from?😍
Does anyone know what vlog cam this is?
Are you the only one that works so hard around there? I never see Shane helping you and by the way, please tell Shane he would look so much better if he would get a shave and a haircut.
What about an outdoor rug?🫣🫣🫣
But like, the Drake reference? 😅
Who was the guy in the back?
Did you shock the pool before you jumped in??
Shane, how much weight have you lost?! You look great!
Did anyone else know Ryland from Clevver before he was with Shane??
We need to know what Shane is doing work out wise and eating wise because I’m struggling and idk what todo and it would be great if Shane showed like what helped him lose weight because he looks amazing and healthy.❤️❤️
Yeezys really?
Why would you buy anything from Kanye west?
Rylan, can you show us what camera you’re using? It’s so cool that it moves and follows your face.
am i the only one who thinks the quality of this video is a bit much? there’s too much going on (edit wise)😭😭
I was like: Should I watch my nerdy space video or Ryland's vlog?  Ryland's vlog, duh!
Ryland! Why not buy some furniture covers for the more delicate stuff? D:
how good are the RX bars??? ive always wanted to buy them but i dont know if it will be worth it
What about a solar fountain?
What's going on with Colorado?  Will you go back there soon?
Am I the only person that gets a terrible headache everytime I drink a can of flavored sparkling water?
Serious question. Why does anyone support Kanye? Really tho
Do you think you will sell your Colorado house?
These vlogs bring me so much joy , why? Who knows who cares I love it ❤️ thanks you guys for the glimpse into your day~
Does Shane ever do anything around the house!!??
Was it fun or was it nerve-wracking to travel with the twins for @Ryland Vlogs? Just curious; love y'all! ❤
Maybe I don’t have enough B12 but how do Ryland have energy to take care of twins a husband vlog and decorate wtf
24:31 do u have any idea what kind of rose bushes those are? Theyre gorgeous😍
I feel like the courtyard still needs an outdoor rug and some pop-of-color pillows (especially yellow) that match the flowers to tie it all in? Otherwise its just a wee barren, but still very lovely. <3
Im JUST curious WHAT Ryland did to the upstairs balcony that he cleaned off in the LAST???? Video I was hoping to see an 'extension' of the patio carried on from up there but I guess NOT LOL
Does Shane ever help you with any of the housework or yard work? I say this as someone who loves Shane. I just notice that you do a lot by yourself in these vlogs.
RYLAND: do you treat your roses with anything to keep bugs off? Specifically rose slugs? I gave up on roses because it was constantly fighting with those suckers
Do you guys plan on going back to your Colorado house this year
What happened to the catio thing you made?
Ryland baby why don't you become a personal decorator? You have such a good sense of taste
I love you guys but why is Shane never helping you with anything?
Ryland why don't you seal your furniture  - The company I saw is called Flex Seal, check them out for your outdoor furniture! { Not sponsored**🤣}
What do you think about a patio carpet under the patio table
Omg a big rug would honestly tie it all together?!? 😮😮😮😮😮
Mulch ? Maybe bark is something else in cali lol
It doesn’t look green at all of the camera accurately depicts the colour ?
Is Ryland getting a dad belly?   Cuuuute. 😉
Am i the only one that cant stand the slurping noise sound affect in any channel. But i cant stand it in real life. I try to ignore it but sometimes HARD! lol.
Is it just me or are the vlogs too short 😵‍💫 I love longer content nowadays!! Leave it all in even if it seems boring to the vlogger I promise most viewers enjoy it! >time stamps help as well<
Where are your shorts from that you’re wearing while fixing up the courtyard / patio area?
I'm not sure if you let your cats outside or not but the yelllow lillies you have in the snail pot are toxic to cats
Buying yeezy AND starbucks in the same video??? Yikes
The editing always kills me 😂 Ryland as the Sun lmfao  Ps can I make a suggestion/request…? Can you post the vlogs on the alternating week of Shane’s podcast so we have some content every week from both of you 😇
lmao what does shane do at all to help everyday 😂😂😂🤔🤔
Where can I get some of that energy?😊
What if you got a solar water fountain tis an idea love u girly
Haha what about that spider gave black widow? The big round shiny abdomen the whit or red hourglass on its underside?   Why not use the umbrella out by the pool? You may be able to find a base cheaper at Costco
mcdonalds and now starbucks?? come on…the boycott……
Who else only clicks just to see the cute babies?? ✋🏻
He kept saying bark, and I was so confused what the fuck is bark? Why are you painting the bark in the trees?? I call that mulch lmao
Ok….why was Ryland HOT 👀 after that shower and hot yoga😍
What if you had a local artist from youtube come out and do the horse justice with a cool design???
It looks great, Ryland! Totally not necessary but maybe an outdoor rug or 2 could level up the cozy feel even more? Either way, enjoy your new space! ✨
What’s Shane working on? He’s so mysterious in this vlog 🥰
Have you looked into developmental leaps? I noticed with my little guy that his fussy times lined up with him going through a leap.
Before I get past your delivery..why didn’t you just get your go cart 🛺 & bring it up.??🤣🤣🤣🥰
Gorgeous makeover!  Not sure if your kitties have access to the patio but lilies are poisonous for cats. Even if they just touch them. ❤
Am I the only one who wish these videos were an hr long?❤🎉
Please, do you not realize people are supposed to boycotting Starbucks?
Ryland please check if the plants and flowers you bought are safe for your fur babies. I worked at a Emergency Animal vet and lillies are poisonous to cats.
Random question!!! But did Morgan meet the twins yet? Love y’all!
Is the catio still there for sweet Cheeto Ryland?   What do viewers think of the editing y’all? Be interested to know.
have you ever considered maybe an outdoor rug? the flooring is beautiful but it can break it up a little bit (whether you choose to put one under the couch or table) so it’s not so much tile
Why don't you put patio furniture covers on or atleast a Tarp.. to protect the patio furniture??
What happened to the catio? 🐱
Ryland do you want to come do my backyard next?? It looks amazing!
Have you thought about an outdoor rug out there?? Perhaps under the table to make it feel like two sections?
Is it just me or are the table chairs way to small for that monster table? Ok, maybe it's me..... But I LOVEEEEEEEEEE the yard!!! Beautiful...
do you guys have a nanny? you're crazy productive with two babies lol
How did u not die at that spider and what did u do with it OMFG
