How much ozempic is Kelly on?
Is Tanner doing a PeeWee Herman impersonation?
To younger generations: see that run? Do you see him running to this guy? That is genuine excitement and desire to love another human, and this is why we will always love and respect Jack Black
Holy cow why does that poor woman have EIGHTY first graders?!! Even if that's divided into 4 classes, that still must be a big school!
Can we get Tanner on the next Tenacious D record that would be a blast to hear
If only Tanner knew who Jack Black really serves. Lol
Did anyone else feel like Tanner was about to kiss Jack? 😂
Am I the only one who teared up watching this? 😅
Why does Kelly Clarkson look so different?
Did someone just calm Jack Black down😂😂😂😂 producers need to hire him in case Jack goes off the rails😂😂😂
When did Kelly Clarkson get so thin wth😭
Did this make anyone else’s eyes well up or just me?
Idk if Tanner really wants to find a gf or ge just feels like it’s something he is supposed to do.
Ummm, how do I apply to be best friends with Tanner? Imagine if we all had a friend like him ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is Kelly sitting in a Sabai chair?
80 first graders is too many first graders, is that a normal classroom size for that district? How does that work?
Kelly who?
What is his favorite Tenacious D song? I like to think it's 'F her gently.'
I just wonder if he knew Jack's name or not 😂. Not trying to be mean but I thought spectrum people were quiet, some don't talk - they sure he doesn't have touretres? Jack Jack jack jack
4:15 jack in his mind probably: are u trying to punch me or kiss me?🤣
I love how Kelly asks follow up questions. A lot of interviews are from people who don't know how to talk to a Neurodivergent person. Some interviewsers just say, "oh, I love that."
what kind of world do we live in; where kindness, is a disability
Who's chopping onions around here??
How come Kelly’s accent gets more southern?
why am I crying
I want to date Tanner! Is it unethical to date someone on the spectrum?? He just makes me so happy and warm feeling
Did somebody cut an onion? Ughhh 🥰🥰🥰 Jack IS an AMAZING human being!
We are all crying right?
wtf is going on ?
80 first graders for one teqcher!?
Jack black is married?😭I’m envy that woman
What about the other cast members? They deserve a spotlight
Was Tanner forced to get the HAIRCUT of an autistic person? 🤣
why did this moment make me cry??? Tanner is such a beautiful soul and seeing his amazing energy compared with Jack Black's was more than I could have hoped for. 😭
Did she say 80 1st graders? She's the principal right? Or do teachers really have that many kids in one room? Collage/high-school make sense but 1st grade? Maybe I herd wrong but I swear she said 80😂😅😅
Oh my God is that jack black? No way!
How old is he actually?
Kelly Clarkson has randomly aged backwards?
When was the last time you were this happy for anything? Brought tears to see genuine happiness.
I need to know if Jack actually gave Tanner his number.  Tanner4life!
Is jack going to finally come out this year?
Wait a minute,  wait..... I might be out of touch since.... well..... is that Kelly!!!??? Where tf is the rest of her???
Were has Kelly disappeared too
Am i the only person that wants tanners energy.
The more I watch tanner the more I question if this is real. No hate. Just I have trust issues 😂
I’ve always wondered if Jack was on the spectrum too ❤
Why am I crying watching this??  Such a beautiful moment.
Who cutting onions in here? 😭 He’s so pure hearted. I would fight for him.
Was anyone else sobbing the entire video ? Or was it just me….
Is Kelly another one on this Ozempic?
Am I the only one crying 😢 😊
Why am I crying??????
Well. I know I started crying..Wbu?
Why am I tearing up 😂❤
What if he was just acting like he has autism
I don't get the context, someone explain.
Who is the woman next to Tanner?
Who else on here has a crush on Mr Tanner?   What a gem of a good man.  We love you Tanner all the way from California to now in Texas!!  Keep being amazing😊❤
