How did the ugly and mentally ill people come into power? That's some heavy hitting Dem media control and propaganda. They can twist weaker minds.
wait...these women were getting dates? Even the one with more piercings than a primitive tribe member? Are we sure these women weren't just trashing men on the app who refused to even give them the time of day?
Why do they always have the same haircut, same glasses, same piercings? It's like a starter kit.
Why is Lord Farquad mad at Asmongold?
Is that the Homely Chick app?
Are shemales and trannies welcomed as women on your platform ?
If you’re and in cell  whatever that means   What are unable women who spend all their time on the Internet called because literally social media is dominated by women   ?   They love to come up with nicknames for everybody else. What about themselves?   Unda’s that’s what I’m going with “unda’s meaning un datable “
Why do these scumbag females always go for the Lloyd Christmas, Insectopod, smarmy f*ckface look?
What about the trans and they them pronoun people how are they ever gonna fit in now?
How is the app even legal to begin with? Can us guys also make a similar app?
what's with this wig and fake video filters?
1:33 who told her that it might look good?
Only weird chicks use this app?
why do they all look like THAT
That haircut?  What's up with that!
0:12 Anyone watch Good Mythical Morning?  Tell me she doesn’t look like some messed up girl gen z version of Link?
Seeing how there have been some studies that link nose rings to a higher chance of mental illness, the question is Why is the Tea app so appealing to mentally unstable women?
i wonder if a new category for disabled whatever they are is needed
Wow what bridge did that thing crawl out from under?
Why are these women always gross?
Wasent it a woman who actually got in and leaked everything
Was that a dating service or a cattle auction?
Now suddenly gender only spaces are good again? Lol
You're upset that someone leaked your personal information on the internet in order to mock and belittle you? Yes I imagine that sort of thing would upset someone.
Wtf kinda creature am I looking at?!? Busted ass haircut, stupid glasses, and libtard mentality
Imagine if there was a site where you couldn't join unless you were a man?
Isnt doxxing illegal? Tea is man doxxing.

Oh no, the doxxing-app users got doxxed. Karma?
Did... did i hear the SUPER EARTH ANTHEM during the "tea spill" clip ?!?!?
Why do all the women look like they have never dated any of these men? The two women who created videos are clearly batting for the other team or my radar is just that good it's blocking problems before the happen, minority report style. 😂
what chin beard 300 lb beta male is dating these.... "women?"
Can anyone confirm if the "hack" was really just someone making public domain info forefront in the news?

wtf was that
I want to know if the person that cut her hair went to jail.

What's up with Feminists always calling the kettle black....It's a really bad look in 2025
Why aren't they still having a fun time on the internet? I don't get it. Can somebody explain why it's not fun when their photos are released? Can't we just have some fun too?
To start with the app: how do you prove you are a female? By taking a picture of yourself and showing your ID? Well, well, well... So, if a man puts in a wig and lipstick, but you can clearly see his Adam's apple, that's not a woman? How the turntables...
Glasses are fine, but what’s up with those bangs
Where is this list? I would love to see if there are any of my ex-‘s on there.
Did that app ever operate in the EU? GDPR violations with a potential of huge fines, etc.
Do these, and i use the term loosely, women cut their own hair? It would explain a lot if they did.
What was their plan keeping all that info?  There is no way you need to keep the photo id after you verify it.  What they fid is in breech of GPDR for example IIRC.
If they only need the ID to verify that the user is a woman. Why did they store that information? In exchanges or finance applications it's necessary to store this info just in case the gov asks for it, but in this case? Play stupid games, win stupid prices
Oh no… Anyway, how’s everyone’s day going?
Do these “women” all go to the same hair dresser and say “make me look insane”?
I wonder how the Tea members feel about Snowden and Assange?
So does this mean "Tea" is an acronym for Toxic Entitled A$$holes?
So do they know who leaked the info? Are these women thinking it's a man? LOL it be funny if it was actually a woman or a trans.
Why do these women think we're supposed to feel bad for them?
Why are white women so weird rn
Wtf are those bangs?

Wait, they put your weight on your ID in the US?
why do i hear Heldivers 2 Democarcy song on the background????

Did your editor just slap the Super Earth Anthem on this video?   If he did, you should pay him more.
wonder if any of us who have been single for 8+ years is on the app
Whoa, need an ID for the app but not to vote because that would be ....
Oops, people dont like their information being spread among random people?
1:02 Was that the fucking Super Earth Anthem???

WTF is up with her hair?
Why is it the ugly girls that always ruin the Betty Paige haircut
why are they all hogs?  I mean stupid question, we know why.

Wait, they weigh you for your driver's license in America? Or did that psycho actually pencil in 182 as if the 2 was an important detail?
Bro, how am I just now finding this channel?
Wow the doxxing app got leaked I wonder why.
Why care about the looks of a woman when it's her actions that she should be judged for?
Who cuts she/it’s hair a beaver? 😊
The bangs dude?  You missed the bangs.
What did we learn from McArthy? Carefull making lists lest you end up on one...
What's up with those hideous bangs??
Wtf are those bangs
Yet women wonder why men don't approach them anymore
Wait how did any of those hippos even know any information on these guys, theres no chance someone actually asked them out to a date
How is an app that's gender exclusive even legal? How is it legal to share other people's private information without their consent to unknown amounts of strangers? How would they know some crazy stalker doesn't get on there to stalk their exes?
Someone wants to make bear spill app for guys?
How did they know i was 'someone nasty' ?
Ladies, assuming you're even here, what was the issue with doing a criminal background check on the guy? 😕
LoL whats the site?
i’m not sure if this is a fact or not, i heard the app was designed by ai 😂
Maybe protect the database with an actual backend? Jeez.
Isn't doxing a federal crime and doesn't this app do nothing but dox men
Seriously is that a wig?
Jabba the huts dating site?
How can you find the leaks? Starting to think it didn't happen lol
ID in the US have weight information?
Why is it that both women in the video talking about it have the same haircut 😂😂😂
Hey this was funny, but why the jump scare at the end?😱
So it’s an app for 2s and 3s?
theres women in the list DOUBLE my weight??????
So you had a U.S dept of Defense employee, upload their gov ID to a dating site? Are you jokin?
Are there even ANY hot chicks on there?
How is there no legal case on both sides? Like first of all sharing personal data of a stranger sounds very illegal and then the data leak itself while morally yes you deserve it but like how is there no legal case?
......accountability what?!? These women are all just plain dumb
Bro what is that haircut and glasses 😂
Were these women even seriously getting dates to begin with? Something makes me suspect they were just making stuff up about people they hated.
What is that hairline
Where can I play the game already?
The one with the septum piercing has an Adam’s apple. How did “she” get that?
I literally had just heard about this thing so I don't really understand what is even going on here. So it's a fake dating app aimed at exposing men? Exposing them doing what? Is that what it is I still actually don't understand what the hell's going on here😂
WHAT LEACKS, IT THAT PICS ABOUT SUAGE SPILLS???  LOOL :)
the glasses?..... bro that HAIR! WTF?
And they wonder why men want nothing to do with them 👏
Are we not going to talk about her hair
Whats funny is how they want a selfie to verify if you're a woman, but what if you're a mtf trans and they say no? So are they homophobic 😂💀
why, if you are ugly, you want to be vomit inducing ugly?
How is the TEA App legal?
That hair cut she gave herself, wtf is it I'm confused why people want that beatle juice cut?
Where is the tea spill game. I want to play haha
Why are they leaking a list of whale species?
I sorry, who were the "nasty" ones?  The women that were secretly talking shit about men they dated, sharing the men's private info without a care, or the people that let out all gossiping biatch's private info for all the world to see?  I think we know the answer.
What do you even ask the barber for when you get a a haircut that bad?
broooooooo what is that cut man?
why do americans always struggle with the words coordinates and "turret" the amount of time i've heard americans call the turrets on league of legends "turrents" is unreal
Who on earth cut that woman's hair?
Next up "did they use tea app" app
wtf, bringing grenades into the fight?
IT war against men? Are these ladies for real?
WTF IS WITH THAT HAIR???
Can trans men use the app.
Wtf are those bangs.
Do these things even have functioning brains? They act like automatons regurgitating what their overlords tell them to with not a single thought of their own or any thought for that matter.
Yo, where would someone go to check up on your own info on that site? So I can avoid going there.
I'm actually starting to wonder if this app was designed and created by a secret manosphere sympathizer specifically to allow the toxic doxers to be doxed.
Wait so are they transphobic? How does a government ID determine gender accurately now?😂 according to their logic
Why are all these people so yucky looking?
Why do all of them look like demons
They can walk on land now??
Why is there helldiver music in the background
Did no one else remember the app Lulu?
The fact this went as long as it did without immediately getting sued off the internet is a mystery. Because it's breaking SO MANY privacy laws.
How is it legal in the first place
Always ask yourself “ladies” that if men or another group did it, how would you feel? Bad, disgusted, violated? Then I guess you shouldn’t have done it. It’s no wonder someone hacked it…
My question is why these girls all have hairlines like a fucking 60 year old man
wait? for real? man, TF is going on with the States Allowing this to happen, afaik, doxxing is a crime and should be punishable by jail.
Where do I collect my 200Ib prize?
You guys have the weight on your ID? I bet some people would need to get it reissued every 10 all-you-can-eat feasts
Well now I wanna know who the men were that got put in there
Why does her hair look like the basic hair from 2006 LEGO-CITY set?
Wait, you have on your ID weight? Thats wild :D
So when do we get BeerApp for guys sharing stories and tips about women? That's in development right?
Rising gym memberships among the male population due to increased demand placed upon them regarding their ability to physically lift their potential mates into their transport devices, and then some time later into their sleeping/mating apparatuses. One ponders what kind of schlong you must possess to be able to physically penetrate the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Queens.
And they wonder we won't approach them
Where can i get the data dump?
why do they all look like oliver tree
what's the average weight? 270 lb?
1:51 How did Red-headed Adam Warlock in  get verified?!
What's the Tea app?
why do these women have bangs going up to their scalps lmao
And why do all the users shown here look like cousin James? Hell maybe that’s why you attract what you attract!
I wonder how theses idiot women would feel about an app that exposes gold diggers,skanks and cheats.😂 there would be an uproar 😊
I hope she didn't get her hair cut like that on purpose.
Who’s gonna tell these chicks that nose rings aren’t attractive
Wait… so in this context they know what a woman is, and they expect government issued photo identification?  But voting for the president you don’t need ID because it’s racist and trans women can go in women’s spaces? The rules are subject to change at any time for any reason without notice
Asking for a friend, where can we play the tea spill game
Whats with the smelly fringe haircuts??? 😂
What’s a foid?
Does she cut her own bangs?
bro. why does American id's have their weight listed? lol. that shit is too funny haha
Who is this 4 Chan?
Is it odd that many of these women are literally too big to fight (as a HEAVYWEIGHT) in the UFC?
How is that app even legal to begin with?
Tea app  huh What’s next called be…Wine app?
Did she really say “ coordinants” ??????
Head on a swivel?  Don't join apps.
wait so is this like that thing 4chan did with the tea app... or did i mix that up? idk why ppl think exposing stuff = fun, like doesn’t it ruin half the vibe?? maybe i’m wrong idk
Uhh... Is the video muted?  Edit: nvm yt was glitching out.
is that damaged goods club? or simply damaged goods wannabes?
Can they just be deported into a communist or socialism country because it fits their ideals? Nobody wants or wants to deal with them.
Did the girl at 1:30 request for that bar to be installed crookedly?
The glasses, what about that hair cut?
Brothers in Christ; How are the mental acrobats defending hackers instead of supporting peoples right to social privacy.
isn't discrimination based on sex illegal?
What’s with the bangs??? Jesus
What's up with the Helldivers theme at 1:02 ? 🤣

Lady has an incel hairline and thinks she has room to talk?
Where is this map so I can avoid it
Two hundred and sixty pounds?

Why would ANYONE had that hair?...
Can we say "Honeypot?" Seems like a honeypot. Caught a bunch of feminist pooprakers.
Oh noooo , what happenned? Noooo that's terrible 😂
what? now you're taking your own medicine hurts you? fckin HIPOCRICY!!
How did those ugly women know info or red flags about those men in the first place? I doubt that they used to date.
do they not understand that they are doing exactly what they are complaining about? or do they just want to be hypocrites?
could it not be very easy to spread misinformation about people without them knowing on this app?
Even with a filter she would look like a man, why did she do that to her hair/head?
Why do so many of these women have the same haircut? I mean do they just go to the hairdresser and say "can you make me look like Spock?" Lol
Whats up with that haircut? Did She do it Herself?
How do we get this "leak" to be put back 😂😂
is that a woman???
After seeing these "women" I'm also starting to wonder "what is a woman"?
Why is it always the pretty ladies?😂
Was this a Reddit vs 4Chan moment? 😅
why do they all look like a different variation of the same person 💀
I'm 5'10" and fat (overweight), but not obese. How is it that these 5'2-5'6" women weigh as much as or way more than me?
Why do I feel like this happened before a few years ago? Something very similar happened, but I can't recall.
The intentions are fine but how do these women genuinely not see the problem with how this is being executed. This kind of information should not be able to be freely accessed by others and its that simple. The fact that they do not see ANY of the irony in this is insane.
What happened to equality they can dox men and make all kinds of allegations, yet how dare men find out who they are They can tell everybody where you live and look like but how dare people find them out Modern Women are the biggest hypocrites ever, equality, when given they cry
is there any way i could see my Profile?? i have lost count of how many times i have been Ghosted?? lol
who would put their info in an app, you make that shit up on any sites you go on naturally right? like who even puts their real info, crazy, if it asks you your real info, you delete the app or leave the page, period.
Omg wtf is with her hair
So the Tea App is just a dox app? If a woman that has NPD traits she can easily use the tea app and start a smear campaign against her victims.
Is SeaWorld offering a reward for their beluga whales?
We all knew they were ugly. But this harrowingly ugly??😂😂
Where do you go to play tea spill?
what's the site where you can rate these monsters?
So, what gets leaked is less info than what they themselves were putting on the app and yet they are the ones to feel unsafe?  The absolute hypocrisy and lack of accountability is astounding
170-190 how can someone be such a massive hog, pig, cow, whale, seal, elephant, hippo?!? How can someone like that be trusted to review ppl that wouldn’t never have the stomach to touch them not even with a gun to their heads? :)))
WTF haircut was that 1st one??!!
And tell me honestly - would women like that give honest opinions about why a guy was a red flag?
wtf. why is there the weight
0:05 Ooooooo, what’s the tea? 🫖  Noo wayy…more leaks!?  😂 Haha can’t catch a break,huh?  How does it feel?
Are those reddit and discord mods????
Why'd she copy Chit's haircut
Was this app created and coded by women or something? Lol
Wait, muricans have height, weight, eye color written on their ID's???
Damn is nobody on that app above a 2?
Lol, why is there helldivers music in the background
What the hell are these pictures that are getting used? Why would you look at one of those and think  "Yep, that's me and that's how I want everyone to see me."  ? 🤦‍♂️
so women who were basically cyberbullying on an app get mad when the same thing happens to them?
I’m confused…why is reddit removing posts where these doxxers get exposed? Not knowing who is out there possibly spreading misinformation and fictitious criticism seems extremely dangerous and unsafe for all men. Someone needs to call Morgan & Morgan lol. It’s class action time.
Wonder how many Sweet Baby inc employees were in the leak.
the fuck is a foid?   Also god damn these people, like they wanted to create a list of undatable people? like, wow, self report harder _PLEASE_
but aren't they supposed to have a tea in prison as well?
How do you play the Teaspill game?
Why are all the women who used that app ugly?
Can we now talk about Toxic femininity ?
The most embarrassing thing is how easy it was to breach and leak everything.. Was it some vibe coding loser?
Where can i find this list to check potential partners
Whats the game?
I didn't catch the part where they made a "Am I Hot or Not?" app for it hah
how  do we unleak it? can we put it all back?? dear god i dnt wanna see any of these pictures ever gain wtf
What the fuck are those bangs?
Is she wearing a beanie, or are those her bangs? I've never understood that haircut.
Really want editor lore. Super curious if he uses AI voice or is real British guy
I wonder how many of these doxxed locations are fast food places 😂
So is this verified as real?  Women, on a site dedicated to badmouthing men, sharing their personal and other info, are complaining when THEIR personal info, from that same site, is hacked and shared...???
Bro why she got a mullet?
Wouldn't that app be illegal? Doesn't it violate the law about posting photos of people without their consent and doxxing?
Wait a minute, hold up, are you trying to tell me it was just a feminist men hating circle jerk all along. What a shocking turn of events, who could have seen that one coming
Needed a government-issued ID to join a gossip app, but it's too much to ask to vote in national elections?
man where can I find that site?
So this is the list trump didnt want us to see? 😂
Is it any wonder why these women need to rely on an app like this? It just makes what they would normally do easier.
How do they all look so similar?
Did they have biologists on staff to determine who is and who is not a woman? Also, how can this be done via ID card?
What is that haircut? They had the same haircut wtf is happening
Do men date women with that haircut?
What’s the website? I can’t find it 0:57
What is that abomination you are watching? I'll bet she smells like birkinstocks, granola and shame.
What can you even say to this? You just can't fix stupid. You can't protect stupid from themselves. They will always find a way to lower the bar.
So will there be an app to avoid the women who used this app?
So.. the app is not racist for requiring a Government issued ID to sign up?  But voter ID... clearly racist.
was that the helldivers2 theme? HAHA
U know, I dont think ive seen the person who created the app but was it a guy or a girl? if it was a guy that would be gold, also curious if someone who was a guy who worked on it did anything with the info
So women on a doxin' app got doxxed?  Divine tier irony. 🤣
Why are all the images of the guys the best picture they could find lol.
Can we please report the app for facilitating doxxing, which is illegal?
I wonder what the red flags were that these women used when submitting men to this app? Has a stable job? Takes care of his mom who's battle with stage 4 cancer took everything out of her?   I've encountered more women that left guys with a stable job for a boy with no job and a rap sheet long has my arm. So rap sheet isn't a red flag. We know that.
How would Tea avoid lawsuits from men were are being defamed on their platform? Seemed doomed from the start
how do I play this teaspill game lol?
Yo where is the pick one game yall sould play that live lmfao
So it's the men's fault as usual? Well, women will never say words like sorry, accountability or I will pay.
they want to leak men's personal info, so why is it so horrible when their personal info is leaked too?
Lemme guess, the entire backend was coded in nodejs
Wait you have to have an id to use it? I thought that was racist.
Wait American driving licenses have your weight and height on them? First off why? Second thats actually hilarious
Why is it always Whamen with hair that looks like an unsupervised toddler found a pair of scissors 😂
can this app be sued?
Anyone else not even angry anymore? Just tired and disappointed.
what the FUCK is that hair?!
Where can we see the pictures/list? For our own protection. I don’t want to talk to any women that have used that app.
What is happening with her bangs, jaysus, why is this a thing
Where is the "would you rather" game? Was spill the tea taken down?
Why do they cut their bangs like that every single time?
is her shirt supposed to look like a starbucks apron?
Am i crazy or are the four pictures at the end the same exact woman??!!
That said, judging by the users profiles on this app, it's questionable whether they even had partners to steal data from. Their behavior seems incompatible with maintaining healthy relationships.
please someone answer this question, why do all these entitled women always have the same ugly ahh bangs haircut??? i swear
link to the game ? asking for a friend
How long was this thing running before it got btfo'd?
I’m not sure, but I think it’s illegal to take someone’s personal information that you don’t own and put it on a database without their consent or knowledge   Cpc’s?
5,3 200lbs!?!?!? Hooolly fuck
I question whether this app and its users' actions are legal. These women posted their partners' personal data online without consent - a clear violation of data protection laws. Only the data subject can authorize such disclosures. Which prosecutor's office is investigating this??? It’s time for the FO part of FAFO thing.
5’6 182 lbs as a woman??? Start working out lady yikes
They're always the victim.  Just ask them.
Accountability? Women? 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Wait a minute.......what is a woman?
I got doxxed on there and "are we dating the same guy" fb page. It was awful.
1:50 WHAT IN THE INGROWN TOE NAIL LOOKING AHS COW IS THAT
That’s a women? Looked like the bad guy from the first despicable me 😂😂😂😂😂
Brother, can you not put a disgusting orc in the thumbnail?
1:28 WHAT KIND OF COW IS THAT
What is THAT on the thumbnail? Like genuinely, who does that?
You know who else is playing the floor is lava with taking accountability?? 😂😂😂
they put your weight on government issued ID's in the US?
Oh? Oh no, what happened!?
0:36 restricted from men?  Isn't that sexist?
They made a doxxing app, what did they expect???? No doxxing????
So, is this for fun, or is this for women's safety? It cannot be both.
OK guys… what advice would you give your sister or daughter to avoid being suckered by a dangerous man? There are news stories all the time about women being beaten and killed by supposed boyfriends. . I’m not saying that I agree with this app, but I understand why it was created.
We got the hoglist, but can we get the epstein list
What is up with her hair helmet?
Why is the Super Earth anthem playing in the background lol ?
Why do they all have basically the same face shape?
Wait, what? Women only? What’s a woman??
what gives anyone the right to collect this type on information on anybody
...why do you think it's intended to leak their info? That's kind of a weird assumption.
I wonder why most of the userbase of this app seems to be so fat...
What is with people going out of their way to look disgusting?  The glasses, the nails, the hair, the attitude.  Who is it for?
With those bangs!?!
So how was the app even allowed to be legal in the first place thats basically a app to stalk somone
How were these people running the app not getting sued for doxxing people?
fun? doxing men is fun? sharing photos of them without their consent is fun? talking shit about them is fun? How toxic, narcisstic and misandric do you have to be to call that behavior fun!
So...I wonder if the DoD lady should be looked into to see if she was using government databases to dox men?
Why are there so many mentally ill people in America?
That hair and those glasses... Like, are they trying too look like the ugly girl from 2000s movies?
What is up with the jacked-up bangs? Looks more like a man repellent.
Another thing, why aren't there apps for men only, so we can warn others about the crazy b's?
Who are these freaks and how is this being allowed to happen?
Wait 4chan is back???
WTF is tea
Is this what is called, spilling the tea?
What is with those bangs? Hole-E shit
Not allowed to have fun on the internet? LIKE FEMINISTS HAVE BEEN DOING TO US FOR 40 YEARS?   Bwaa! Hahahaha! FAFO baby!
Why all of them looks like Miss Trunchbull?
I wonder if that one chick got a free bowl of soup with that haircut?
wait none of those men would even go for them, why are they on the app?
What are those bangs
What's with the dumb and dumber Jim Carrey haircuts?
How do we as men find out if we were hazed on the app without making an account and searching our own name?
As a man, can I just ask women... why do you guys cut your bangs off and crooked like that? Plus with that glasses combo you're trying to look like a lesbian batista,  I wasn't event thinking she was into dudes haha
An app designed with the singular purpose of doxxing people? ... I'm pretty sure doxxing is illegal. It sure as hell seems like it is given how serious it is taken.
1:10 wait i thought responsibility being these womans krypronite was a meme? Use an app to doxx others, get doxxed yourself  and instead of realizing the irony of it and taking responsibility you blame the app for making what you did to others happen to you?
What if this was all one big scheme by some disgruntled dev and the leak was part of the plan
WTF WAS THAT SABER TOOTH NOSERING
I wonder why the tea leak isnt referred to as spilling the tea.
Making derogatory comments anonymously about men only is considered "safety"? 😂
What's that? You posted a shitload of pictures and information of yourself on the internet?  Oh man!
What if the Tea app was actually in on it? What if they were never "hacked" they deliberately released all that information and pretend that they got hacked🤔
1:40  Did anyone notice the weight seems off?
The Slampig Coalition of Mopeds finally unionized?? 😯
Which app? Why should I care for some app full of lgbtqrxyw+++ shes and hims and its?
dude .. who wears bangs like that ?  only 4 year olds that gave themselves a hair cut  and mentally ill people who think they look like Betty Paige ...or Audrey Hepburn
so are these the female versions of incels? seems like it.
These are the women who want you to be at least 6ft but you ask their weight and its a problem lmao. I'm over 6ft i just don't like whales
Something I've learned over the years of the internet never never piss off question try to stop 4chan it is the sleeping bear of the internet 😂
The app literally allows women to dox men and they are angry that they themselves were doxxed?
We are all liberal women starting to look like homeless creatures?
Um What men did these abominations have any kind of contact with
Why are ugly women mad at men? Men didn’t mean you ugly and men sure as hell didn’t intentionally make you look uglier. Imagine thinking men don’t like you but you do everything possible to repulse them.
Don't women know that nose rings are for FARM ANIMALS? 😅
how is this app even legal, if the roles are reversed if men rated women red flagged them give their locations etc there would be an uproar
Why does every single one of these losers have a thousand tattoos and piercings and dumb hair?
WT*F* thinks a piercing in the bridge of the nose looks ‘good’?
So, those are the types of women who could be looking up info about me on an app and then deciding not to date me based on that info? Kind of makes me want to create a fake profile and spread terrible rumors about myself just to keep them at bay.
For all those wondering, these are what chicks from Portland Oregon look like.
Bruh they used Firebase as a production DB what were they expecting?
If libel is an actionable form of defamation, and all of the information about the men has been leaked, don't they all have a case against their accusers?
so basically it was a farm game where you can show off your prized hogs like on a farmers market?
Why do all the women weigh more than men?
Why do they all have the same hairline
Am I the only one that's lowkey proud of myself for never even hearing of this app until the "scandal" came out?😅
Why is the WGT on the ID? Why does the government need to know how much it is?  Is it for the police, so they know which car they need and they can't get sued like lyft? Or does the government provides a service to find partners based on your preferences and filters the others out?
we have so many quest markers
why she look like the chick from bobs burgers?
Didnt Candace owens already try and fail with something like this?
Why are they always so extremely unattractive?
THE GLASSES?!? WHAT ABOUT THE FUCKING HAIRLINE/BANGS!!?
these people cannot talk without blueprint sentences and buzzwords ? like are they incapable of forming brand new sentences like they are incapable of loosing weight ?
how can someone cut there bangs like that and like it?!?!?!??!?!?!
I do want to know who the lowest rated dudes were so I can send them a pint for their service.
These losers were trying to rate men as undateable, really? Isn’t that pot calling the kettle black?
Where would one find this Tea Spill game?  Asking for a friend...
Is that a woman?!
Anyone notice how all dem heaux at da end all looked alike?
The whole app was doxxing men, and they are mad that they are now doxed? That's fair though
Isn't this illegal? Shouldn't they be getting prosecuted?
Why have these women had bad experiences and poor luck with men? I can't imagine why.
Oh no!  What happened?  Oh no!  /sarcastic laughing
looking at the male sewer slide rate since 2007 i ask do men really need this? do we really deserve this? throughout history only something like 30 percent of men procreated. I've given up on life at this point and it's because of things like this. there's just no point.
Where is the list?? Lol like Epstein list 2.0
Women having fun? Then this is just men having fun😂 wow they get on that app to basically dox and when it happens to them then it's unacceptable?? And not just men having fun?
Is this what you call a honey pot?
5’3” 190lbs? Holy shit.
The fuck are these haircuts?
Forget those glasses. Did she use a banana to mark where to cut her bangs? WTF!
Where can we see the list of these 304s?
They all look like fucking toothbrush wtf is going on
Is this karma?
A US department of defense employee used her ID to get verified on a stupid app about ugly women? She sounds like a liability if you ask me
Why are they always unfuckable goblins?
wtf are these haircuts holyyyyy
But why do they all look the way we expect them to look??😂😂😂
Is 4chan back? Please tell me 4chan's back!
they all have the same fringe?
What kind of haircut was that?😂🤮
These women look like hot topic freaks.
where can I find that tea spill page?
how the fuck that app is even legal?
Where can i find the leaks?
5’ 6” and 180?! I’m 5’5”, and 130!
So wait does karma only exist for them when Mercury is not retrograde or something?   I can't understand their logic. So they wanted something bad to happen to others, and in doing so, something bad happened to them, but only now it's unfair!?
There should be a public record lookup of "was this woman on the tea app?" - kinda like an offender's registry.
Why do identity documents in USA list a person's weight? Isn’t that weird? I mean, weight changes over time… No country in the European Union puts weight on an ID  😆  Ahhh, but now I get it — Americans always list whatever they’ve got the most of - FAT ;)
Why toxic women look always in a certain range equal?
I wonder if this was reversed and guys developed the war app which they could go on to and find out if the girl they are interested in is a psycho.
Are these women?  I can’t tell how did they variety it off of just a picture? 😂
They just believed it was secure and full proof?? 😂😂  Fucking banks get hit with cyber attacks what makes them think this dumb start up app would be safe?
How this app was even legal
Why do they all look like people that would do that?
Why do they ALL somehow look like lord farquaad
Why they all look like red tur ds? ahahah
WHAT if the tea app was not a dev accident and really a political move to expose all the weirdos?????? Everything is so fake these days
Wtf is wrong with her hair line? Lol
You mentioned her glasses, but what's with her hair or is it a hair net causing those bangs.
where the fuck is the website bruh
Where can one find this leaked data?
You know, if a guy knows he was talked about on the tea app, would he have grounds to sue the tea app and the people responsible for doing it? Sounds like an easy win: defamation and breaking of privacy laws
How could they possibly have thought uploading government identification to a gimmicky app's server and all kinds of personal information would be a good idea? Also, since practically only 20% of dudes have repeated success with dating apps, are they all harping on the same 20% of dudes?
How did those women even get dates? LOL. We live in a clown world now.
Wasn't there a scandal where women created a spreadsheet of men not to date, and when that got exposed, some went to jail?
They built an app to expose mens info online and rushed to sign up for it as a good idea.  Then the womens info got leaked online and they are upset?  What is with women and insane double standards?
When my friends and I where in our twenties we tried to look our best, i.e., easy on the eyes. What are these women doing to themselves? Is it an ugly contest? Their minds and bodies are ugly.
Can the guys exposed file a lawsuit against the app or even the women that put them on blast?
OK  Im gonna ask it.. What The FUK is up with those bangs and that FIVE head? I mean if your forehead is that big seriously pick a better haircut and glasses that dont draw attention to that exact area.
1:05 helldivers?
Why do all these wannabe commies all look the same with their ugly arse bangs?...
Hold on. They wanted to slander people, sharing their personal information with impunity and without the ability to disprove it, and call it "women just having fun on the Internet"?
What if it was a woman that hacked Tea ...!  If she or her and male friends did release the geo locations of these females personal information , then society is healing
Somebody nasty leaked info? Look at what you're doing. Don't think what you are doing is nasty?
I refuse to believe those jabba the hutt looking hambeasts were getting dates, so were they just making stuff up about random guys?
So doxing people on the app is ok?
Isn’t this a version of “revenge porn”?
THAT'S A WOMAN???
Imagine if that was the purpose of the app all along?
Can I ask.  So are White Guys still going to talk about the White Replacement Theory when 99% of White Woman are nasty and most to all White Guys become Passport Bros and F up the White race themselves?
Why do they both have a variation of lloyd's haicut from dumb and dumber?
Why do these woman choose the worst haircut possible?
Why aren't women who complain they can't get a man called "incels" as well?
When are girls gonna learn that anything connected to the internet is not secured; giving up your license is a stupid idea if youre not making money (for tax purposes)
These people,  trusted an app.  WHY?   Tomorrow Musk can Leak your ID for your check mark...    WHy do you trust these people.?
Is that Andy Dick?
1:27 "what the hell is even that???"
0:11 are you sure it's the glasses and not those hideous bangs?
I wonder how many of these undatable women use Snapchat filters to catfish men?  When the men show up and see they look nothing like their profile, they ghost the woman.  The woman then goes to the Tea app and doxx and libel the man for being horrible without his knowledge or consent.
What is with their bangs. Gross
anyone else raising an eyebrow while remembering the wisper app that showed you how close the OP was?
Im sorry but what was that at 0:33
Someone wrote an insecure app? If you want a job done right, get a man to do it.
How mentally unstable do you have to be to get a piercing so high up on your nose that it’s almost on your forehead
If she can't have fun because she is a women, has she tried this neat simple trick that apparently works nowadays of saying "I am a man" and magically reality bends to your will and everyone has to say it is fact? Then she won't have to worry about not being able to have fun anymore.
So was it a bunch of overweight unattractive people sabotaging men because they can’t get them?
Shouldn’t people be able to sue for defamation, slander, and liable?
Wait you have WEIGHT and HEIGHT on your IDs???
200 lbs at 5'3''  with a 75lb head . They should turn to Islam as they demand face coverings , is that why they are so angry ?
Do these goofy ass people look in the mirror. That girl has the most hideous hair cut I've ever seen.
what is up with those bangs?
Looking at those women - how are they dating to even judge men?
Why do they all have that same stupid haircut?  It's not edgy, it's fugly
I'm confused...why is that girl not more concerned with that awful hairstyle? Does she not understand how bad that looks?
wouldnt this app be illegal in CA, due to strict privacy laws
I wonder if trans dudes were allowed to join
Why can't 4chan do this but with Collective Shout and the payment processors?
For the life of me, I do not understand those nose rings.
Is it really hacking if your app has the same level of security as a pr0n website that just asks if you're over 18?
Maybe the whole app was a psyop by 4chan to catalog the psycho
Does anyone believe that these women ever went on a date?
Why am I not surprised?
wait, is the helldivers theme playing in the background when the editor is speaking?!  masterpiece!!!
I'm wondering how much longer before a class action lawsuit goes forth and bankrupts the company
I thought that requiring government ID for something was racist? 🤔
So it was ugly, fat women who wanted to trash men...because none of those men were interested in them.  Serious question: can women in the US get any worse?  I mean, what's next for the as a group?
Wasn't requiring ID racist?
0:50 The top left corner of the map. Lower Alaskan region or Canadian? Wtf how sad. 🤣
Wait this happened because of 4chan? Dang I guess they had relevancy again.
These women are getting dates?
These women truly want to be forever alone huh?
And you want to tell me that these women aren't incels?😂
Why are all liberal chicks ugly?
Do your driver's licenses have a weight category? :D
Why can’t I find this map anywhere on the internet?
Why do they ALWAYS have the worst haircuts you've ever seen
Isn't that also illegal to store personal data about the men without consent
"fun time?" these toxic ass fugly & mad garden tools were having "fun time"? Just imagine if men had this sort of app huh? would tyese these toxic ass losers consider it fun time then huh?
4chan is making a comeback???
How does this shit even happen was it even 12 months when that tranny won the court case against the other women only app
is that helldivers national anthem playing in the background? I legit looked around if there was a "Rising The Flag" objective nearby.
worse? thats better
How are you gonna dox people without the thoughts that you gonna get doxxed some day too lmao.
Some parents must wonder how they went wrong.
discord now is asking for ID .... lol think of the possibility XD
How come they always have glasses and goofy ass bangs!
And people wonder why men are done with women
Wait, was that the Super Earth anthem?
... what ID requires your weight in it?
Is this app for cave trolls.
So the app is strictly for dikes then?
These people want their app more secure than voting...how about that?
Wth would want to date these toads?
Isn't blaming the app just victim blaming? I mean they're the ones that were targeted attacked? Or are they saying that they weren't wearing enough cybersecurity so were asking for it?
How come all their hair lines are that of a crazy person
Why do these hags have a bowl cuts?
Can 'trans women' access Tea with ID or would they be refused and considered men?
why are they ALL fat
Why does their ID have their weight on it, considering its something that can change ?
1:01 Who the fuck Is playing democracy's theme in the background 😭🙏
Why American IDs have weight on them?
why do they all have those ugly haircuts?? 00:10 edit: and see through weirdly shaped glasses
Who thought giving service providers your ID was secure
WTF is wrong with her bangs @0:00
We do we keep trusting these companies with that amount of information?
I cannot get over her bangs. Did the barber mess that up on purpose or is that a trend?
I'm almost 6 feet and weigh roughly 170. How the hell does someone 6 inches shorter than me even get to 200 pounds, let alone be the same weight as me?
has the url/link long been deleted?
why these women need to worry about the dating market at all? This is not their fight.
So is this app for liberals bc they all look like liberals
Anyone got the url description for the teaspill rating game? Google's trying to censor it up 😂
And for the millionth time in my life I wonder why women are so incapable of logical thinking.
If men aren't supposed to have access to this app, does that mean that all the leaks came from a woman?
How are you that short and weight that much and have any expectations in dating.
In the US you put height and weight on driving licences? Wow.
When are we gonna get the face piercing MRI story in the news?
How do cows use an app?
I'm just 160 lbs. How could these women weigh so much more than me?
Does anyone know the link to that “teaspill” ranking site?
Unrelated to the content: why is this narrated by David Attenbrough?
She looks like she cuts her bangs with safety scissors. Anyway, was the app about having a "fun time" or was it an indispensable safety resource for women? I'm losing track of the narrative already.
Was this the list of pics and data of all naural disasters around the world?
Is this app legal ? I guess in Europe it is not if you check it against the GDPR. And that can end up expensive.
So they were actively leaking personal info, and then cry when they got caught and it happened to them as punishment? I call that a taste of their own medicine.
Do these women cut their own hair?!!? 🤣
You know, I hate to judge people based on appearance, but it seems like the nastiest and most anti-male women tend to be the ugliest and fattest?
The glasses? What about that awful haircut? 😱
How is that app even legal?
What’s up with these girls hairlines?
Am i going crazy or did this video have the Helldivers 2 music?
I have a question for these folks, both the users of this app and the ones who made the app-  What is a woman?
Why are all of those girls both shorter than myself and heavier than myself? 🤔 Interesting correlation. But I'm married, no need for silly apps like.. obviously doxing people 😐
so let me get this straight.. theyre leaking information of MEN on said app, but when their own info gets leaked, they play victim?
Why do I get the feeling that none of the people being doxed on Tea contributed to it's hacking? Meaning those who were involved did it just to be dicks lol.
Why would you sign up like this!
Checking if someone is married or on a register, I can understand. But anything else is an opinion and subjective. That app is a massive libal case waiting to happen
What is the super earth anthem doing in the background
Who posts their DoD CAC online as a method of verification?! 😭
5 ft, 186 lb, NOT a bodybuilder…. Something just ain’t adding up 🤔
Why some of these girls look like they're inbred
"How do you write women so well?"    “I think of a man. And I take away reason and accountability.”
So basically the app was the equivalent….and this a big stretch wondering if YT will delete it….”Sleeper Karen”
Wait, so the app was created specifically for defamation? Isn't that highly illegal?
Why do lesbians need an app about men they don't want?
How about those pedos in government
What on earth is that haircut?
How is “gossiping, doxxing, and accusing men of crimes with no way for them to defend themselves” fun to you???
Tea Leak? We Boston chaps still remember that, eh?
Is that like the female version of the mullet?
Wtf is that hairstyle 😭😭
But what if the posts about me were just a bunch of hot ladies talking about what a catch I am?
What is a WOMEN? Weird how the left suddenly knows the answer to that question when it effects them directly.
doxing people without their consent is "fun" for her?
Does the app show how many cats each member has?
i wonder how i be looking on my google verification videos now 😂
I can't find the teaspill game anywhere, where is it?
how can one be that chopped and then go on to doxx their partner
Did they not think it would happen
I wonder how that user distribution map would look when superimposed on recent treatments for Bacterial Vaginosis?
So they need you to give them your government ID to confirm that you are a woman? They say that s*** like you can't put a wig on and put female down and go get a new ID or driver's license😂
Sometimes i wonder what type of person my algorithm thinks i am
Just asking ... are we really surprised internet trolls look like trolls?
How's this app legal?
Did it pay money for THAT haircut?
Why are they all 0.5/10?
why do they all look like that? 😳
Do you think maybe it was all part of the plan? Like having an app where women have a free outlet to spill at the crap and doxx men; only to be "hacked" and have it turn against them. Like having the a profile picture, with their location and also their weight, it's too good lmao
Those girls date guys?
Where can i find the data? I need to order some pizza you know.
Makes you think about how much data these apps store.
Wtf are those supervillain glasses on that starbucks cashier
Isn't creating a huge dossier of people, names and all without consent HIGLY illegal?
Where can I play the tea spill?
1:03 is that the super earth anthem?
How does this work for them with their whole a women is some who identifies as a women? guess they dropped that LGBT bullshit now?
Why is the Super Earth Anthem playing on the game
interesting detail noticed by europeans...... you Americans have your weight (?) printed on your legal documents?
Why do they look exactly like we thought they would?
How to tell your app wasn't programmed by a dude.
What tf is that hairline😂😂😂
0:31 Is it legal in the US for any app to require such personal data?
Isn't it illegal for a business to discriminate against gender?
How do you look like the first girl and call people incels. Oversized glasses, unwashed greasy hair, brown.
Did every lady in this video lose a bet!?
you guys have weight in ID? xD
I don’t actually see the issue here like, if I could get an app to watch on women I will probably do it, not for expose but for pragmático y know more, so I actually think is great because many bad men out there and for the information I got this app just give a good search and that’s it like no bank account information so, what’s actually the deal here?
Bro the fuck is that fringe
which is more dangerous to be leaked by the app or to get Obesity?
Maybe stop being a man-hating c*nt and bad things won't happen?
Will they ever learn accountability?
What did they expect
I want to know if I was being talked about or someone was doxing me on the app.
i wonder. for how long do they think we LET them do this kind of shit. All they have to remember is wait a minute MEN LET us do all this shit  if they wanted to we would be chained to the kitchen/bedroom  and striped of every right....... WOMAN i once loved you creatures
Was it for fun or for safety?
what if its the other way around?
why is this app still up ?
their weights got leaked???  haha funny shit.
Never heard of this app. So any crazy woman that may not like a guy trying to go out with her can put his info on it? Is this what we have come to?
Half the ladies in the leak were 3s and 4s, then some 5s and very rarely any 6s but the men they were asking questions about? All 8s or 9s and straight up 10s.
for Super Earth?
Why they always look the same and have the same vibe
Are these female incels?  Are they even female?
Why do they genuinely ALWAYS look like that ?
1:50 Wait, do they weigh you for the ID in USA? Woah. I mean, why? Weight can change drastically so that information being stamped on the ID is kinda useless in the long term.
What if it was a 4chan user that created the entire app just for this purpose 😂
Ashley Maddison also had a leak didn't it? How come these women don't understand that they will always be caught eventually when doing bad things?
That's not a dude?  Shew wee
how do you even end up with that hair? it doesn’t even look physically possible
Maybe femcels are real after all…
What if, The app was a psyopp and intentionally set to get these women? like imagine some ass hole made the app, got women registered that would talk shit about men, and then got ¨¨hacked¨¨ to reveal all the info XD
So, did they have to prove somehow that the men they were blasting were actually creeps? Or could anyone just post anything about a dude?
Why they all look like that 😂
Wait,  murica has weight on IDs? That's genius,  in Europe we track height on ID.
Was it a do your own haircut app?
WAS THAT THE SUPER EARTH ANTHEM?!?!
They found a flag in the middle of a field in the middle of nowhere and your surprised they got the info? Hell from what i'v gathered there wasn't even a hack just poor programming n security on the app side of things.
War between Incels and Femcels to see who’s the most celibate involuntarily or voluntarily?.. idk…
How do we play the game? xD
Are we sure that wasn't an app for some underfunded Open Range Zoo?
Can we do an app to evaluate women too , I think it would be great since so many are walking lying red flags and also , why not ? I’m not misogynistic, just want to fell safe.
So, if people wanted to they could defame me on this app, and deny any attempt I have to clear up any defamation simply because of my gender? That sounds like a big lawsuit in the making for any men defamed on that app. Also with each picture it showed I could hear the vine boom sound even though it wasn't there.
lol US id have weight and height?
I wonder why this sounds familiar 😅
Dunno if this is even the place to be asking, but where do you find the leaks? I'm morbidly curious if anyone I speak to used it, I'd like to never interact with them again if so.
Women not taking accountability? WHAT?!?!?!
Wait, wasn't that illegal in the first place? Plus they had virtually no security at all, meaning many people may have accessed the database prior to the hacker known as 4chan.
Do i hear helldivers 2 music in the background?
Any links on the Tea Spill game?
Those glasses?? Or those bangs??? I feel like the bangs are absolutely a No-Fun-Allowed mentality
what does FOID mean?
Can this app know if you're a man or a woman?
And they wonder why chivalry is dead
What's the game name?
What if this application was intended to do this type of action from the very beginning? 🤔
Is that hair or a hat?
You want to stay safe but you give your ID to an app on the internet? What next? You send money to Brad Pitt you are dating over facebook for surgery?
I thought this was an app for women? all these mugshots look like dudes
1:28 what in the fallout 4 character  customization happened here
How is an App like that even legal, it is all about doxxing random dudes...
Weren't women literally lying about being raped/SA'd and cheated on by the men they submitted on that app? A woman literally got shat on in tiktok bc she took some random guys photo saying that he's a cheater and girls should watch out for him, his sister saw that tiktok and WENT TO TOWN on her ass. In a women only environment women compete consistently to either be: the prettiest, the meanest, the kindest, the coolest and now the most oppressed to the point they will lie to garner attention, women only spaces are nice but women only apps? You're asking for total bullshit.
Coordinates? That's a pretty big word for a liberal feminist.
So they all go on there and pretend to care about red flags on men whom they can't date or what?
0:15 Woman? Except that Adams apple sticks out hard.
Is this man
Good grief. Personally, I wouldn't want my information handed out so easily. Where's the privacy? So it's only okay if woman do it, but when men, suddenly people realise the issue at hand?
And then they wonder why more and more western men are becoming passport bros...
What!?! Ugly women trying to put red flags on nice looking men so that women they see as competition won't date them? Nah, women are not like that...
When do we get to create the "hoe" app, we can share what they are willing to do on a first date
Talk is cheap, show me your Teaspill elo.
Do US personal IDs seriously have height and weight listed on them?
So they put their body weight on there? So they don't really mind as long as its only seen by other women😂
Dude why the hell these woman look like a goddamn ork😂
Why do all of them look like farm animals.
where can I find all these leaked data ? I'm a web app dev I have some fun legal ideas i want to develop
That was a woman?
Femcels mad that their doxxing got unoed?
How do those bulldozers even have any info to dox? Unless you get catfished, who the fuck would meet up with something like that? YIKES. Sidenote; why do american ID's have the weight on them? lol.
I'm genuinely curious as to what these women were talking about on that app, since I'd find it hard to believe that any of them have even interacted with a man
please reassure me - normal women don't actually think this app was ok to begin with, right?
can anyone give me the link to the game
What's with the haircuts? 😅
WHY DO THEY ALL LOOK OF THE SAME WOMB
How do they not understand that they were doing exactly the same thing that they are complaining about??
Is there an app where we can laugh at that spastic haircut? These bitches need to know that they can't pull of those fringes....
Did you see the bangs?? Come on guys, nothing sensible was coming out of that face
their rights.      _why?_
was the responsible security a female by any chance?
What the hell was that for a bloody freak show?
What is with those self-cut kindergartner bangs? lol And that dude was far too generous calling them "lower mids" because these B's are bottom of the barrel and the barrel in question was topped off with rotten fish and used hypodermic needles from an AIDS clinic.
Can we access these women's data online? All of them are reds flag for men, and we need to know who they are. Seriously guys we need this data to be public.
Why do they all look like.... this?
US citizens have their weight listed in their passports?
I guess not wanting people to effectively dox you and go behind your back by asking random people yes or no short length questions are incels now?   What happened to reason?
Im confused, is it about safety? Or is it "having fun"?
Why is this website being hidden everywhere?
Damn, then the app for fat guys that will do the same is named “sandwich”?
Why tf are all these ugly, nose ring, hilarious bang , woke chicks allways in the middle of dating drama. If I saw chicks like these two in the video. I would also like a red flag warning about them.
Is this called reverse sexism 😂
They are mad for doing the same damn thing really?
Why are over half of women so fucking allergic to decency?
What the fucks up with those hair lines.
Wonder if there is a searchable database of leaked information.
How the hell is weight on the Id? Wtf
Where can I find these leaks. I wanna see if anyone I know is on it
I don't see the problem with the app on itselfs because there's a lot of cheater and fraud if I understood the context like it was supposed to save people from cheater and fraud?
Do you write weight in passport or what lol
Does the Death Stranding 2 Picture mode work for verification. I thought about having my wife sign up so I could check it out. Glad I didn't.
Lorax: "That's a woman?"
LOL, why do all of these folks have their bangs cut so short?
wait you have weight and height in us IDs ?
Was there anybody hot on the damn thing, or was it all just... Monsters
Is this why they desperately try to ban male only spaces ? because they're scared of men doing the same thing they're doing privately within their girly groups?
Hold on, how are they even allowed to exist to begin with? and why these women still free? They literally doxxing people left and right and they didn't get jailed for doxxing? I thought doxxing is illegal?
And they got dates how?
How are these women even dating anyone
Did Tea allow Trans Women?
Can anyone please provide a link to mentioned teaspill game, the internet search isn't very successful, too many games with similar names.
why are they ALWAYS ugly??????????????????
Why is there a hell divers 2 anthem playing in the background?
How do I find the map?
Forget about the leak... why is the app still available for download?
what they wanna feel safe for, they literally publishing personnel information of men with full details , last i checked law, usually people get sued for this and wasn't this supposed to be a crime publishing someone's sensitive information without their consent??
Did they not allow men to write the security code?
"Tea App" ? Judging by the appearance of the women there, it should be called "XXL Cola app", just saying.
Who is wasting time with this hogs?
wait so the Tea app can get weight info for profiles but tinder cant? Not gonna walk a chick home when she might have a heart attack on the way
Why are all of them bellow average?
1:01 Was that the Helldivers music that plays when you raise the flag or have I been playing Helldivers too much lately?
1:03 Is that the Super Earth galactic anthem!? XD
Why does every woman on there or complaining about that have a haircut that looks like a pug's ass after it backed into a space heater?
where can i get this game?
wait... you have your weight on your ID?  thats wild.
I'm sure there are still some normal women out there too but how do the insane ones keep multiplying. The ratio seems to keep getting worse and we're already past critical mass.
Have they tried confidence??
Which crazy man has contact to these humans?
I ain't complaining about the leak. But for fuck sake... If these groups are hacking anything, wtf are they not hacking the government and trying to gain access to info related to the Epstein files and list? JFC.... Do something fucking productive, you bunch of orange-fingered 4chan fucks
I guess Verification Selfies didn't have filters?? lol
Who bedded these gals? Have some self-respect.
How come Tea app users all look like THAT
why is her hair like that?
One may be balding but at least you don't have this chicks hairline... Wtf is that?!
Your IDs have weight record on them ? How is that even possible when these people can crank up the gluttony anytime anyday ?
Why do they always look the same?! 😂 Hope they enjoy the taste of their own medicine.
helldivers theme background?? lmao
wait why are we calling this the "tea leak" and not the "tea spill"?
Waiting til we find out this was the true purpose of the app
1:01 Is that Lilly Tino on the left?
What's with their massive foreheads 😂
Now I wanna see the statistics that show how many trans people tried getting on this app but got rejected because they couldn't pass.
Tf is up with their bangs?
Why did they call it "tea"? Should have called it "Big Gulps" because that's all who use it.
So they're okay with doxxing men but then cry victim "women can't have FUN" (fun as in doxxing someone?) when the same happens to them?
Was that Super Earth National Anthem?
Wait, did I get it wrong, there's an app that requires full ID verification that supposedly leak male users data and allow access to female users. Which, in turn, got its female users IDs leaked by a third party, that enraged Twitter femcels? I must have got something wrong, this sounds like a South Park joke rather than reality.
Is this animal cruelty? Leave the cattle alone!
Confused European here. Do US passports have a "weight" entry?!?
Were Trans admitted on the app?
Can someone signup for Tea app if they identify as a Woman?

Taking bets, on the gender(s) of the CIO/CTO who runs the app and didn't look into security?

Leak? It is a leak when small droplets comes out of the pipe. Judging from this size of the users I will call it a burst
I wonder if they consider the government issued ID requirement to be suppression and the women-only rule to be gatekeeping.
