“Did they have a date for Spain…?”Volk seems so desperate to get his rematch.
Henry didn’t show huh?
Why peeps asking Volk dumb questions
Crazy that these videos always cut off the very beginning. I hate to be negative but why??
please stop giving John Generic Morgan first questions
How was Rob vs Paulo not fight of the night?..
How do you qulify for the sport intereviewer in here? Half the questions are chatgpt generic shit.
Why didn't hernandez get an interview dude is a beast

Wait until he finds out about taxes in Spain
Have people forgotten Jose Aldo?
Asking how many seats is the Santiago Bernabue like hes expecting 5000 seats 🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂 That stadium is one of the biggest in Europe
So Ilia doesn’t want to fight the previous champs in his division and won’t fight Movsar? Yet he wants to fight Connor, who can barely make 170?!?!?  Lol.  This guy is great, but he seems like another joke of a champ.  I can see him holding up another division, like Leon.
And the main fight on 300 was what?
What happened to usada?
Boy, Dana danced around that Conor question. They really did Chandler dirty.....
What about Cory ? He was next for the Title 😢 Merab is a beast tho

30:19 Merab wearing a Sean O'Malley wig ? LOL
No cejudo interview? Lol
Connor McGregor questions are so stupid. Connor will never fight again boys
Illia wants a new challenger? I hope they match him with Zabit
Why is leon getting thrown 3 different opponents when we all know who is next for that tittle belal he deserve that shit
daaaamn who was the three ducking Leon ?😳😳😳😳, Ilia just became a global star wilddddd …. Max/islam/malley… only ones who didn’t like that combination 😮‍💨
Didn't GSP take years off and came back and won MW against active Bisping?
Did he sign the bonus cheque before the Costa Robert fight?
Fight of the night was Dern/lemos? 😂😂😂
I don,t understand if Volk realy deserve a rematch he had two chances to take the 155 belt nd now directly a rematch looks like kiwi thing same as Israel Adesanya... rematch... mmm
💀😂 they ask Dana the dumbest questions
“What do you have in that cup there?” Dana’s cup: 👀 Dana: uhhh Dana: an energy drink… a MONSTER
Lemos and dern but not paulo and Whittaker? Ok.
The questions the dude ask.. WTF these guys ask the fucken lamest questions.  Here's one.. How stupid are YOU? Fire those fools

Ufc 300 top 4 fights going to beat tonight's top 4 fights? I don't know if they will or not tonight was crazy good
Ask sneako about what fights are like
How is Whittaker and Costa not FOTN?
10:28 I want to know what happened to those three opponents. They all say no and if so, why
Some of these questions 🤣🤣🤣 "What do you think of someone else thinking something?" WTF Good on Dana for just saying "WTF are you asking me???"
How the f… didnt costa or whittaker get a bonus. Thats some bs
The press are asking so many dumb questions like wtf is going on.

Now what? From McGregor wannabe to to fucking champ. ARRIBA ESPAÑA
Who are the 3 that are to scared to take on Edwards 🤔
How did costa and Whittaker not get a bonus
Why yall can't stop crying and admit that Ilia destroyed Volk?
1:39:40 The guy asking Topuria what would be a date for Spain is so stupid… Spain got mentioned how would he have a date
Why dana looks a little wired
Why dont anybody talk about potential fight with Makachev? Are they scared?

Only 2 seconds in, but how the hell did Rob and Costa not get FOTN?...
