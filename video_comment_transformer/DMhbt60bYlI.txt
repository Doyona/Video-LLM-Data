Where is Dempsey??
So 8 player zombie mode incoming?
What if the trailer is hinting at 8 player parties?
Isn’t that the guy from the double tap soda machine?
any kind people out there that can fill me in on where tf the zombies story line is at. I left off on the first few maps of bo6 when Samantha came back or something
Buried remaster maybe ???
Ghoul is New Warden?
Did anyone see the zombie bear?
That's not the voice of Jeffrey Dean Morgan right ?
Just for those who are curious, I asked Nolan about Takeo, and he told me he was re-casted and will be doing a less judo japanese voice.
5:31  US Cavalry ?
does anyone know if there will be zombies directed in bo7 at launch?
What if the 2 skulls are Dr Monty and the shadow man
is that Walton?
I used to be so obsessed with the story but idk after B03 zombies ended I’ve had severe gamer erectile dysfunction. I’m staying cautiously optimistic but I just don’t know anymore. This made me feel nothing when I should’ve? <\3
What’s exciting about this trailer ? Stop faking your reaction lol
I want to know about the skull he didn’t use!!
His pants are now feeling creamy! 🤣 How much is Activision paying you to act like a cult member MrRoflWaffles!
Did this guy just drink 10 red bulls or what?
He looks and sounds just like an actor from a show or movie in just can't quite figure out who
Why did they turn to a health bar above the zombie’s head and armor plates? Just make it old school
What is zombies even about anymore
The skulls are Dr. Monty and the shadow man?
I haven’t really watched anything zombies related concerning the new black ops, is it looking good?
I played since Blops. I quit when WW2 released.  Is it worth returning to?
Skull(s) of Nonsapwei??? Are those Sam and Ava's Skulls?
Is that guy a confederate?
Jeb what happened to you?!!
What if the 2 head n the cage is Shadow man head and Dr Monty head
Where’s raptor one?
How tf you going to do a video on a new game when you haven't even seen the ending of the last one? Do you even play call of duty zombies?😅
How does he not give you shadow man vibes
Where’d all the bo7 hate go?? Lmao and we wonder why they keep making games
Bets on it being Alastair Rhodes?!
First thing I saw with his eyes was the sky in origins. Idk maybe he’s the Aether manifested as a human idk
has no one noticed in the top right of the poster it kinda looks like misty and russman
So have they all became undead now?
Is that Walter Scoggins' voice for the Headslinger? Also, he Shang Tsung their ass😂😂
What are the chances the cowbow is Jebediah Brown?
Who is this guy?  Idk. I’m sure they’ll sell a skin of him!
Heads of Monty and shadow man?
MILO!!!! The cowboy zombie looks like the toy zombie in the ORIGINS END CUT SCENE!! Could there be a correlation between them???
8 player zombies?
Could the new villain be Rodolfo?
WTF is The Ghoul doing in CoD.... SMH
jadediah brown? Shadow smith ! Hmmm
Is ashes of the dammed the name of the map?
bros glazing so hard, i wonder how much they paid him
00:36 How though? Like intentionally? You complete these EE's for a living.
More than 4 characters?
Is that Jebediah brown the guy who built the pack a punch black ops 2 in the underground map
Am I crazy or does that sound like Troy baker?
Maybe the sheriff from town?
Anyone eles think the cowboy guy is the black Smith that made pap?
Yo lowkey why does the guy in the cowboy hat sound like the voice from liberty falls gameplay trailer
Is that not the dude from buried? That built the pap machine
I don’t know if this is just wishful thinking, but maybe this event could “remove” takeo’s ability to speak, giving an in-world reason why takeo is mute now (I know there is a voice actor for him, but that could just be grunts and moans when you get hit or something)  Also the scene of carver getting saved by richtofen was nice, as carver was richtofens #1 hater coming into janus towers, so some character development might happen there
Return of buried??
Please get Milo to see this yall!!  White eyes? We've only seen this in alpha and omgea.  Maybe connected to the lingering richtophen in that map?.  Also just hit me  8 players and white eyes??  Yall i think this guy was in the past universe in some way or another..
Is the new protagonist the same voice as the double tap gobblegum machine? I could be way off.
Hold up is the logo on his hat the burried logo?
What if it was the heads of monte and the shadow man
He gives sheriff vibes which could mean that the warden is still yet to be seen?
8 players in outbreak??
Maybe he’s related to the shadow man in a someway?
Is it Jedidiah brown?
Am I the only one that sees rust man in the top left in the poster
Is that Jebediah? The creator of the pack a punch???
No link to the original?
Okay but what happened with Richthofen or Maxis?
Why does the shadow warden sound like boothill from Star rail.
Finally some mystery !
I wonder if he didn’t drain their souls the zombies might now have attacked them
Where's my trucker hat?
I’m sorry but how had Milo not seen the ending yet?
So nobody’s thinking of a cowboy Hudson?
This the Blacksmith from Buried?
Who is replace Tom Kane for Takeo????
Aren't those raptor one's sunglasses???? And doesn't he too speak in a southern accent?
Seeing people theorizing what if the shadow smith is jeb brown the guy who created the pack a punch from the old timeline so I'ma need a video on that lol
Is it possible that those are dr Monty's and the shadowman's skulls?
Collection of souls? Crew forced into a quest to free their souls from being imprisoned in the dark aether?  Could this guy be the person responsible for mob?
3:21 possible hint at a “press *button* to drop weapon” feature? It would be sick to be able to drop your gun for someone else without buying another one
I wanna know what happened to the tranzit crew so bad.
He’s holding the two “skulls”, would it be fair to say the one skull had a lighter smoke color than the other?
Is that the guy from mw3 zombies?
If they are gonna try bringing stuff back could the Shadowsmith be Jebediah Brown
So weve had the blue and yellow eyes, white in this version?
Wasnt the dude that made the agarthan device and pack a punch from a midwest town?
Is it just me or does the villain have a striking similarity to Russel Adler? I hope they are not putting any more campaign characters at random in the story...
Is it just me, or does the cowboy guy look like some form of a different Richtofen?
He's a Soul Collector 😏 I wonder who else's souls he has? Maybe Victis crew and we can release them down the line?
He's a Soul Collector 😏 I wonder who else's souls he has? Maybe Victis crew and we can release them down the line?
Jeb Brown???
It definitely gives me like a buried evil type of vibe. This is a far-fetched question. I can't help but think about the guy that put his wife in the Packer punch machine. And she became the witch and buried, could that be him forgot his name.?????????
If it has outbreak I may pick it up? Undecided
That ear condition is called cauliflower ear, which is deformation due to trauma (getting hit repeatedly)
Is this Mr Peeks ?
Wtf went from black ops zombies to damn walking dead whispering to zombies ? wtf💀💀💀
What if....Shadow Man and Monty Dragon Ball fused into a cowboy?
What if he’s the owner of the farm from tranzit 😂
1:22 bo2 Hudson With camo?
So how is it they can make a cinematic that is visually stunning and exciting and then actually deliver cold pizza?
I’ve been checked out of zombies since they canceled season 2 of bo4, is the og crew back?!
Maybe the skulls he carries are the shadow man's and Dr. Monty's skulls and he's harnessing their power. Hence, them being locked in the cages. It's just a theory.
So what’s gonna happen now, will Ava be in this? We seen her get dragged in by a similar cowboy hatted character, also looks like the same hands that dragged her in.
why do i feel like this is going to be a 8 player easter egg....
Am i the only one that thinks we are missing a few seconds form the last scene, like a big reveal of the map
Is it just me but I feel like the intro cutscenes weren’t this good in bo6, maybe bo6 was filler. Hopefully.👀
Are we back? It feels like we’re back
By any chance is it jebadia from buried bo2 and does this connect to mw3 zombies endscene
Isn´t the new villain Jason Hudson from bo1 and bo2? He looks like him.
What if this is another version of shadow man like they are doing a version of Kang in the marvel world so now they are just doing variants
If its still easy and with CW/BO6 mechanics nothing about this is hype
Arthur Morgan?😂
What if they are pirats in the dark aether he got that pirate sword on his side
Didn't you get invited to treyarch to play this already? How come you're acting like this is all new? Lol
So this is what happened? and is the dark ether contamination the crew talked about in MWZ.
Is it the Warden … from Blood of the Dead ..??? Or maybe Dr. Monty & the Shadow man  as the one
Why do YouTubers always have something to complain about? It’s getting annoying, it’s never good enough…😩
What of he is the guy trying to bring back the old multiverse the shadow Smith? .... now that I think about it what if Jebbedia Brown became a shadow Smith after he was thrown into the dark ather.
What the heck was that, why was that actually good?
Idk why but this man is giving me buried vibes
Ol jeb brown the blacksmith? Maybe
Is this Jebediah Brown?
question for Milo and your crew.. while this VERY much ramps up the hype for BO7Z.. I have timeline continuity questions..   Mainly, we had next to ZERO reference to where Ava (last seen getting pulled into the DA via the mirror in LF during the epilogue cutscene in MWZ) was during BO6.. mainly because of the rewind between MWZ's 2023 and BO6's early to mid 1990's  given the time dilation between the game's real world time and Dark Aether.. the 12 years she's been in the DA would translate into at least a few centuries correct? how much closer will Ava be to her DA Entity twin in terms of power will she be? though to be honest, id recon it might actually be s few levels of magnitude STRONGER..  MWZ was my first real taste of the CoD Zombies universe, and as a solo grinder it was perfect for me.. and what they did for camo grinding in BO6 put me off. but with the MP dark matter and WZ Abyss grinds functionally done.. i want to try and get a better understanding of everything so BO& will make more sense for me
anything western makes me think of buried, could this be the blacksmith who made the PAP?
Wild theory, could be that the guy is a shadow smith working under the shadow man and represents pestilence (one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse) and in every map you’re fighting other horseman until you’re taking on the main big bad
Wait... didnt a leak tell us what the plot of bo7 zombies was? Is that his goal? If so, then why? If its Jebidiah then... maybe? He did sound like a holy religious guy when the angels (keepers) came down to chat.
McCain ?
Jebediah Brown? Would be cool
Am I the only one who thinks that Jebediah?
What if the cowboy is jebadiah brown
Is that Rick grimes? Let's gooo
The Avogadro made zombies eyes turn white... wonder if hes making an appearance because we banished him to Hanford Site in black ops 4, then banished it to the dark aether. Maybe he controls something now?
So is the map called Ashes of the Dammed? Tbh I thought this was the new dammed theme when it was in my sub box
It LOOKS cool, but will it BE good?
I’m wondering if this is the corrupted dark aether version of the shadow man or dr Monty
im thinking maybe jebodiah brown?
I want to know if it’s going to be the original cast for dempsey, nikolai and richtofen
Is cowboy man from Buried? Return to buried?
Was that Micheal Jackson ?
So Primus Richtophen healed from that headshot wound?
Hypothesis:Insane to be that he is maxis,
What if since Takeo is from 1591 here, he cant speak any English so he mainly just grunts and that way Tom Kane doesnt have to be recast since Takeo wont be speaking
what if he is Brutus from mob
Jedediah brown?
Is that Hudson?
Blundel aint here. Whats the point?
