12:13 .... Why does it look like he has bird shit all over his belly
I don't get it what's wrong with them fishing for snapper can someone tell me
How tf did these overstayers get there boat back come on fisherys be more fkn ruthless otherwise your working for nothing
Hang on - why are the confiscated fish not being fed to the needing?
What I don't understand is why throw the fish back into the sea, doesn't Australia have state ran children or old people homes where the fish can be donated?😢😢😢
Lmao is it really worth it to get over the limit I don't understand why people do it. Selling it probably not worth much and fish is not the best tasting compare to beef.
Which country is this?
Why can't the seized fish be donated  to a food shelter or charity? Such a waste if they're already dead
What is the difference between snapper vs scub or porgy?
