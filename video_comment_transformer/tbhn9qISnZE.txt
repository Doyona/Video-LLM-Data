I really wanna know what James, as a Volkswagen enthusiast, thinks of PA Dubbers
I know im late but what if i want JDM, are those old civic hatchbacks as cheap and easy to mod as a beginner?
5:39 - Can we talk about what it takes to set up a whiteboard list that you can pull tape off of without destroying what's written underneath?   How does that work?

Holy crap I missed the new channel!! Was just wondering what happened to this legend
You don't mention the 1.8t swap specifically? It can nevar lose!
Do a bigtime vs speed build contest
I've been modding my MK7 Golf Sportwagen 5-speed manual, 240 HP. Am I still cool? Because, it's a wagon, but it's a 5-speed with decent HP.
Is James driving a G Wagon on the way to the shop?
Where did the coloured taillights go?
VW. Not sure if car fixed itself or check engine light also broke.
Does anyone have any personal experiences to share about Castro's motorsports..?
Why did VW owners did all those cool things to their cars? Because the car is incredibly boring otherwise.
What if it has a trunk?
I always loved the look of the VW Rabbit over the Golf, and I think it came in so many configurations, even a mini-pickup. I want to know why the Golf is so much more iconic than the Rabbit
WHOOOO is the bald red guy????
What part of Kentucky you from? I've lived in Kentucky my whole life
i like how some golfs look, the R32 VR6 awd was something i always interested in, I briefly looked at VW for AWD but ended up getting several 2004 wrx wagons. how is the FWD on these golfs?
what mic does he use ? (i feel like he already mentioned it in a video before and gave like ebay link but i forgot which video was it)
Where’s that discord
Where yall find $5k/7k anything running? I can’t buy anything running for under $10k
Biggest issue is trying to find a MK3 or MK4 with out rust. The front fenders and Rockers get eating up.
Who wants to help me AWD swap my mk4 Golf TDI?
So what happened with donut?
What ever happened to that car you did on donut right before you left
Wait where was the video posted of you and that tech in the shop in LA? Ive seen that video was it on donut?
How much boost were you pushing on it? 😂 vw vortex I’m always on there. Great place to go for help.
15:10 where tf is spain? hahahaha
Does anyone know what mic he uses, just out of curiosity lol
Is the discord chat for the US only?
Is a RS3 a spicy golf with a butt?

PLEEEQASSEE MAKE THIS INTO A SERIES
Can you do a up to speed on the ford coyote?
Can I be your friend if I start working on a 1992 VW Fox that's been sitting in our shop for 15+ years?
Is that calypso blue mettalic?
Wondering why the Mirage never gets the same love. Similar kind of car. Next to no love.
Im not trying to be ignorant but is James still on good terms with the hosts at big time?
Is Mattsoffroadrrcovery your dad?
8:35 how did you NOT throw in "family" haha - too obvious? maybe, probably.
You good bro? You've been fighting back a lot of tears in the vids...
I love that color, what's the exact color you used for that golf?
Trinity alum?  Go rocks!
When did bro get so handsome? Good to see him looking so healthy.
so, quick question. i have a 2008 Volkswagen Golf Plus TDI that i payed 100k for (Norweigan Krone btw, chill! that's around 9k USD.) and i was wondering if it is a decent Project Car, as i REALLY want to make it into a car that really rounds out my style nicely. is it, or is it not a good project car?
I’m in the uk, I have a mk3 polo coupe boulevard, was thinking of putting another engine in it. Anyone recommend anything?
What bout 60s bugs?
i have a 2007 rabbit... does that count?
Where can i get a link to the discord?
James listens to Medium Build??
I have a MKVII - I’ve done some work to it - it’s my daily. Can it still be considered a “project car” allowing us to hang out? 😂
I been searching those wheels for a while, where can i find them? Or how are thet called?
my main concern with another project car is the price of parts. I love my miata, but ill be damned if im paying $300 per headlight lenses again.
So?? You are not anymore with donut???  To be honest I started watching donut media because of your unique style and how funny you make the narrative of the  video. Good shit you started you own channel. I don’t watch donut anymore. I’ll subscribe to your channel and pitch donut it had become boring . Lots of new faces and chicks. Nah.
RUST for a California Car?? Why??
Are we just ignoring the lowered D21 @11:30 ???
@SpeeedCo I have two 1993 Eurovans with the inline 5 cylinder I will be building at least one out of. Anyone know the super secret formula I have heard about with an Audi head on the Eurovan bottom end? Supposed to make a pretty stout engine ready for booooost...
Is the nord VPN promo only for North American subscribers? I am from Jamaica and I signed up. It worked for a few days then refunded my money and cancelled my membership.
Why didnt speed and bigtime just collab?
Nice! I'm kinda in a similar situation with my mk6. If repair bill is too high what to do??? (That's the question I have been asking myself)
Where is the book club discord? Is there a link?
Wheres the Cabrio gang at??
How can I send my 2013 Ford Flex Limited AWD twin turbo to you for the ultimate Ford Flex build. The Ford Flex Community is real and we need help. Our transmission is toast at anything above 599 horsepower even though there are turbo upgrades out there that are bringing 600+
What happened to the 240sx?
Where’s the MK2 community I can’t get mine started 👎👎
Is my boy driving a G wagon he's ballin an has James done a video with big-time yet?
0:13 „replicated“? are you sure? This build is by JP performance from germany and it is not a copy of anything. It isn’t finished yet, but that thing started years ago, wich you can see on the channel. They ended up to use only very few parts of the body, everything else is 100% custom built. That thing is far from a replica of your stock golf.  I mean look at the picture you posted… there is an engine behind the front seats.
Mk3's? Nah...mk4's are where the lines are at imo.
Where is the money option here to help out with the project?
Guys what's the discord link invite?
Pushing that car uphill in wallaby’s!?!? James got MO POWAAAHHH BABAYY
Anyone else can't watch this except on a phone? Tried multiple platforms

As a fellow mk3 & mk4 owner/enthusiast.... im just wondering how the fuqqq the blue painters tape didn't remove the marker off the whiteboard!!!!???? 😮

Anybody ever done a oil filter housing on a 14 q7 struggling
Nord vpn helps me get back on the hub? I’m never kicking this addiction lol
What do you think of the new beetles 98-2010? Aren’t they just like GOLF’s ?
Who is the “bald red guy” he’s talkin about?😂😂
Could you please talk about  the the volvo c30 t5 👉👈🥺
Instructions unclear. Got an EG6. What do?
Didn't they do a V5 in the mk4 as well?
cool vid but maybe at least have 50% of the video being about the car instead of story and background?
hey James love the vid can you do a vid on the vw12 concept car pis.
Hi, James. Fellow Kentuckian here. Have you ever considered doing more acting in the future? Thanks.
0:15 I’m not sure if the mk3 from JpPerformance is the right picture to say it’s been replicated 😂 his thing got a V10 R8 engine on the rear axle the only thing u can say is close to your car is the color and the roof 😂 but still love both cars ❤️
Does the algorithm prefer when I instantly like the video upon start, or does it prefer for me to watch the entire video without any scrubbing and like at the very end of the video?
What's the hardest part about owning a VW Gulf? Telling your parents that you're gay.
Can you tell us more about what that engine is called please
Does a CC VR6 count…?
A 97 golf was my first car, and that funky maroon color. What if like to know, is which planet those rs3 engines go for 500?? When i look it up they are asking full car price.
Is this the same guy that's in Donut? He seems more chill, like a normal cool dude.
Hi James do you still own the old Wheels of your Golf? Iam really intressted on them! Or do you know what Brand and Modell they are? Would love to know it! 😁

Knowing you're in cali, uhhh, do the shops "help" with the smog or like wtf and how the hell you gonna get a 500hp golf past smog?  Obviously not trying to narc on you or something, but just trying to understand how the hey y'all get away with your shenanigans without owning property in a smog on transfer zip code and just registering everything to that.
tell me more bout that dakar yellow e30 in the shop...
James, why can't you accept that you should do car stories. That's your calling my dude. Not cargo clothes smh

Where and when can we hang out and work on our golfs lol
Dose a stage 2 jetta tdi alh  off-road build count?
Wtf happened to donut? Fell apart fast. Yall remember Bart 6 years ago. Yeah he was awesome. He would have done amazing work for donut if he stayed. As the years went on i lost interest in donut for they got more and more lame.
I'm glad to see the golf make a comeback, but I really wanna know what happened to your 86 down the road.   Keep us posted, love the videos!
Was the V & W connected or did it have a space/seperated at V & W?

how much power / boost pressure was it running when it blew up??
Is this channel just James?
Idk, v8 s10s seem cheaper and more fun 🤭
Why you talking shit on Andrew Tate indirectly at 3:50?   Are you more of a man than him? If so please prove it
What happened to the hachiroku?
So yeah…I have a 2010 Passat CC 1.8 tsi….I have a set of 19 inch very rare Lugano rims in mint condition..What should I do with my car?? What is the most wanted mods and what can I do on a limited budget??
Can you also get a Acura Integra project car? Do it for the love of VTEC
What about a VW rabbit lmk your thoughts
You talked about Golf and Jettas. What about the Mk3 cabrio? I have one 😢
I have a 2014 jetta what should I do to it in the future all I have in it at the moment is a sound system
Is this turbo kit for the 2.5 available or if not can someone recommend a reputable turbo kit for a 2007 Volkswagen jetta wolfsburg me and my twin brother have wanted to buy and build 2 of them to make 500-600+(probably only need 300-400) hp so we can get in trouble and have fun and do some bonding lol
Where can I get a vr6 engine for my golf 2001 project car had it for 3 years now no luck

I always wondered why Donut never did a high low with a Golf
How is this channel not called Hersepers!
WTF Youtube.. In the past few days, I have had random videos change the language and I cannot change it back.  I wish everyone would just upload to Rumble also and I would never have to use the dumpster fire that is YT.  Is anyone else getting this?  No matter where I try and change the language settings it just doesn't work.
Who’s the bald red guy?
3:47 what's the name of the car here?
Bald red guy? You talking about red skull from captain America?
The sketchier the coffee, the better the WiFi?
Are you Matts brother from Matts Offroad Recovery?
I have a 2014 2.5L golf, does it have the same engine he's talking about in the video?
The real question is , does your mk3 smell like crayons?
You going to colab with bigtime?
Why do you look like Matt from Matt’s off-road recovery now lol 😂
What the hell is a discord? Where the hell is your dad James?
Anyone else notice the "Commuinity" typo in the slide, right after he made that 4th point of 'Community?' Haha No? Just me? 😂😂 Okay
dude, have you started running? looking good and healthy
Wait, are you not with donut anymore?
Got a 2004 VW Caddy TDI . Any of those in the States?
Collab with Scotto when? Looking forward to this build!
WTF are we unc now if we remember h20i as the good ole days?
i just love cars but cant do anything about it can we make a video on a beater teggy i def was told alot of bad about vw but always wanted a gti
They kept it from him?
What's up with the donut mic ;)
How can I join the speeed discord?
I have never been obsessed with VW but never disliked them and I secretly really want a VR6 Mk4. But I’ve bought 3 Minis instead (2 R53s and a F54). Am I wrong? Have I been playing for the wrong team?
Wait. Is this a car channel now? Always knew it would happen eventually
Love the golf but.......do you have the E30 that you built with Castro? I would LOVE to see more about that.
13:19 what flew off the car when the engine blew?
Wait a second that car was from Karlsruhe that is sick 😅 Greetings from Karlsruhe City, Germany  ❤️
it had plates from Karlsruhe, Germany (red ones, KA*) at one point? that's in my area :)
Who is donut?
I’m not sure about the golf. But I do have 2 Jettas and a eurovan. I’m probably gonna do an 07k swap in the eurovan if the van is worth keeping but it was severely rusted when I parked it 3 years ago after the reverse gear went.
What happened to donut
Hey James. I have a Volkswagen, but it isn’t that old, and it isn’t a Golf. Can we still be friends and hang out and talk about little things about our cars?
Make it RWD or AWD and put a turbo LS engine in it.
What about the scirocco
Okay but why didn't the dry erase come off with the tape.
James didn't you learn about letting towtrucks strap your vehicle down by the wheels when one of the Z's got into an accident on the way to the track?
Who's the bald red guy?
What happened to your voice at the end? xD
Donut media doesn’t come up in my YouTube feed anymore, do you not work there anymore?
Biggest issue with the Golf? Wrong wheel drive.
So, what years are the most reliable vw golf to buy in 2025 to used everyday
I had a vwvortex account... maybe i still do? Back in 04 when i bought my 99.5 vr6. Absolutely loved that car and wish i still had it.
I have a 2008 Volkswagen B7 Passat 6Speed  timing belt burst rebuild the engine + messed up after 8 months. Where is the best place in United States where I can buy a used CCTA Volkswagen engine? If I can't get it for a good price then definitely going to have to sell. It's been sitting for 4 years
Day 6,450 of asking him to do an up to speed on his dad
Did donut gave you problems for getting back the car?
So is this now more of a car channel? I didn't subscribe initially because this brand stuff isn't for me yet there have been multiple car videos suggested to me and this video for instance I really enjoy
You really think JP Performance replicated your car?
I was WONDERING where this was!! WE ARE SO BACK!
I don't have a Golf but I have a TT is that good enough so I don't have to go down the VAG road again
is this not donut?? something seems off about him , even the way he speaks
Isn’t a 90’s civic a better bang for your buck project car? It will probably last longer too.
you need a german friend that drives a Passat (and a Benz 190)? 😅
Man I miss the old forum days - Edition38 was awesome 😢  How do we get on the discord ? Downloaded the app but got stuck from there 🤦‍♂️
Hey James whats the engine code?  I'm exited to see that golf again! please upload as much of it as pissible❤ vw community middle east
holy shit, has it always been that rusty?
why are golf 3 so expensive in the us here in germany they usually cost around 1k euro or 1k usD
I have a T-roc R. It has a golf engine and transmission... does that count?
who is the bald red guy?🤣🤣
I’ve always wondered how shaved engine bays works
ERMAHGERD!!!! Is that a blue ke70 wagon at 3:22? I had one probably about the same time. Until it was stolen a torched. I have a yellow one now but I'll never forget ol' bluey! You have to tell me more about that car!!!
Yer. You had intern’s at Donut? Legitimate question. Sucks for those people.
I have mk1 what has been in body shop almost 5 years now - yesterday they asked what color i want it. Good times!
Where is the discord i need help mine keeps misfiring 😭
Can I be part of the golf club with my Scirocco R?
Please show the rust repairs being done.
Has a W12 in a Mk3 been done? 😂
wait why is this dude here from donut ?
Notice how it's all golfs???
whatever happened to project hi-low?
What…no…why am I…*ahhhh*🕳️💵🚗
wait, is jps golf 3 actually based on this car? no way as for the theory of rising prices because of videos it actually happened quite a few times over here in germany with jp. examples of that are the bmw 140 and 240 f-series
Me sitting here with my thousand dollar 08 rabbit 2.5 steal thinking of selling  for a flip but now wanting to swap the motor into something sicker an cop a turbo lmao damn decisions. I need to hold onto this 2.5 ig
Wait I thought I was watching the bald red guy.

Gotta know what kinda shop stool that is
We all loved forums, wtf happened??!! Why arent we on forums anymore?
Dude !! Wtf happend to the car ??!?!?😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
James been getting on the ozempic?
Any chance you'll collaborate with big time?
What about the BMW?
When are we going to get a speed / big time cross over?
so this is a german honda EF?
Thinking the golf is the best bang for your buck project car is highly questionable.
am I the only one that loves the mk4? it's my dream car since I was a kid
What happened to your energetic enthusiasm when explaining cars and their history? Bring him back please. The same guy in the Donut AE86 Initial D video. That guy had 1000 HrsSprs 🙂
HOW THE HELL DID HE DO THAT WITH HIS HEAD????
Wait, why did it take so long to get the car back from Donut?
Brian Scotto wya?👀
Can i still invest in XAI308K at $0.45? It's going fasttt with no stop in sight
What’s the difference between a golf and a beetle?
You don’t work at Donut anymore?
What happened to his black BMW?
Why is everybody talking about XAI308K? Did Elon Musk really create a new crypto coin?
Why is everybody talking about XAI308K? Did Elon Musk really create a new crypto coin?
pleeease give me advise, i have a ms3 (mazdaspeed 3) but i also have a mk6 gti the mazdaspeed is my project but this video makes me want to put more in the mk6 gti so idk what to do.
does my 914 count as a Volkswagen for the  discord or am I forced to hang out with the Porsche guys?
When did kevin smith get into cars?
Is it possible @robby_layton could repair that on YouTube for all of us to see...
Are you in your jay leno phase of dressing?
What happened to this guy? It's like his soul was sucked out of him. Remember him being overly exuberant all the time, now it's like a deflated version of him and the channel
Replicated from JP ? Jps VW MK3 had nothing to do with ab simple Golf 3 !
wait was this the fat guy from donut?
Who is the bald red guy
I know people get attached to their cars but why Volkswagen I've never seen one that has any reliability behind it cancel the calling in the house market buying money peds you think you're getting a good deal but you're getting somebody else's problems
Is that a g wagon?
10:05 the way he started talking like a toddler after you ask a question they weren’t expecting 😂
How is it rusty i thought it only stayed in cali
You still got the e30?
Is he not at donut any more?
I just guessing the lowrider / hotrod scenes ain’t do none of the body mods that the VW’s crowd did.
Does James have a G wagen as a daily?
I just got a 2000 VW Jetta tdi 5 speed I have no idea what I should do with it any ideas
When are you going to get rid of that Donut tattoo?  🍩
What truck are you driving?
Did Donut keep “Mo Powah!!”? I want to keep watching them too but if they were that petty…then nah
is it me or the mic quality isnt as good as it could be?
When can we expect the Scotto crossover for the VW project?
"Replicated" is a stretch when you show a ground-up tube chassis, rear engined V10 swapped golf who's only inspiration from you is the teal color. Glad you got it back but keep your ego in your pants man, lmao
Wanna have some german license plates? Should be possible to send them.
How did I not know you had an older G Wagon!?!?!?
Is it just me or did we all think that this guy owned Donut Media?
Why is it so rusty?
Did he forget about the civic? It’s been doing stuff for cheap since like 89,. Also the Miata is still doing all the cool stuff for cheap, and it has a proper drive train.
Instructions unclear, got a mk4 jetta tdi
Im not a car guy I’m just getting into cars but what kind of cars are those red and black ones with the trunk open in castros shop? 19:32  If anyone knows 🙏🏽
Let’s talk about this G-Wagen you’re driving in the video… what is it? AMG?
Where the book club at?
Weight loss?
Is that an Element you are driving??😅
What happened to his AE86?
But.... what about Passats? Are they invited to the cool VW club?
Can you buy a '01-'03 eurovan next and make a video, please? Asking for a friend.
It's not a TDI?  I'm so, so, so sorry....
Another membership? Is this how you grift more money from people, it seems like it's always what you do and no one noticed your gimmicks, donut failed because the content was stale...this is new but I can already see mold growing on the crust, more of the same low effort crap since donut😂
this golf reminds me of a certain minty car that does nothing but flammed at for putting fart noises on peoples builds.... I wonder what it was again?..
I have a mk4 wagon we get love too??
Can I hang out with my LS swapped OBS Suburban?
Does a 2000 Passat 1.8t manual wagon count? 😅 I got it for free in VW vortex
Hey James, this is Dave Drell; or rather Volksatan from VWVortex. I heard that you may have bought some parts from my old memory red GtI (from Rob) and I was wondering if that was true? I’d love to see those parts make it onto a running MK3 again. I tried for 18 years with that car and had to give up. I still love that generation and car more than anything else in the world.
Someone found some Ozempic. Where the mass man?
16:23 How is the book club not called “speeed reeeading”?
Hey man, I was wondering your thoughts on the Golf Alltrack (2019 if your opinion differs on year).  I just got one and love the old wagon-style cars. Im sad that they arent making more, but was curious if you thought of them as highly as the standard golf or if you had a differing opinion of any kind. Thanks for the awesome content brother!
Bro where's the AE86?
Do i hear big time Collab?????
instructions unclear i have a MINI lol
Anyone else go to Dubwars at Buttonwillow back in the day? So much fun!
Am I crazy or is the membership for this channel not showing up properly? Or is the membership thing part of the discord?
maybee AWD swap to put all of those beer chuggin buff german horses to road?
How we gonna hangout man? I'm in Australia 🤔
Who is the bald red guy? Lmao
What’s the discord
Where is the ae86
I’m confused why did everyone leave donut?
What happened to the AE86?
Can i join if i have an old a6 wagon? 😅
Do they make a mk4 jetta grill with those aux lights available?
What about a Seat Leon mk1 it’s basically a golf right?
Can you review a mk7 GTI
I dunno i think a wrx with a k20a in it is better........
Is big time gonna be involved in the rebuild ???
what is your vw discord???
What magazine were you showing at about 2 minutes in? I have a blue r32 and that one in the magazine just awakened something in me.
Did Tyler the creators BMW have Schnitzers on it?? They're rare asf in the UK if they're 18" concaves
Why do Americans say Voltswagen?
Wait I already have a golf. What’s is the discord name ????
damn what model is that at 2:50?
So JP's R8 with a Golf3 covering is a replica of your bucket?😂😂 Somehow I don't think so.😜
2:51 PVW only covers what now? The huge stack of print editions in my archive begs to differ, as they not only do cover Audi, Porsche and, occasionally, exotics, but also SEAT, and a couple off-brand derivatives. 😅
Great vid! Question though is it just me or does James look like he's on the verge of crying a lot of the time
I don’t have a golf, but I have a clean 68 beetle, does that count?
Where's the 86 btw?
Are Wallabees back in tyle? Haven't seen those since high school (2006)
Can we have an off-topic? 😂
Are Miata owners allowed in the club?
do an sc or is sportcross build 👀
James, Do you know what the K wire is? I learned the hard way after a stereo install on my Cabrio and my car wouldn't pass smog. it's a brown 9v line that runs on a seperate system than the 12v system. I had bad eye and thought it was a black wire but it was dark brown, ended up splicing with the ground wire. Turns out it was a communication line for the EMS. Anyway, something to think of! Cheers!
Can you go back to black plastic bumpers!
instructions unclear : i now have 11 hondas
James, what do you think of an MK3 GTI? 😁
I have a mk4. Does that mean we're car bros? If so, there mom! Told ya i would be something someday. And if not, well i tried without knowing at least 😂
I have three project Golfs.     How many more do I need?
Here’s the thing. I don’t think YouTube reviews automatically equal line go up 📈 a fitness influencer reviewed a leg extension / curl machine and the price actually went down $50 on Amazon. I already had my eye on it, so i ordered it immediately.
You're first car was a s13?!? Where is it?! That's some bullshit. I believe you, it just hurt my soul. Like really bad.
Does my 2012 Jetta sportwagen count as a golf?
Are we sure this isn't Big Time's garage?
Anyone know where I can get the link for the Discord server?
But what's up with your ae86?
Can i do crazy lighting for your car??
Can you truuuly ever finish a build though?
You ever get in touch with LTT? I know they talked about sponsoring all the folks that left donut.
I wonder how many europeans could be able to watch the entire video. i made to 8:40 and heard "community" then i am done
Donut who?  Happy to see this video
Commuinity??
His goals are beyond understanding
Whoa be careful using “not documented” they’re going to come repo it back to Germany
Who tf is tuning these cars because every one yall have tuned blowes up. They need to put a more conservative tune on these builds.
Idk if it's the best bang for buck but it is cool
what happened to the black mk3
Replicated???? Are you serious?????
Wait james branched off too?? Why didnt anyone tell me 😭 insta sub, and fuck what a good video, editing on point.
Bald red guy?
Cool video, not a VW fan but those Golf’s are as cool as they come. One request, will you do a video on auto manufacturers selling their customer’s driving data to lexis nexis and other data brokers? Who in turn sell said data to the driver’s insurers. A truly awful practice. I’ve been saying this for a couple years now, and RCR just did a video on it, but as automotive enthusiasts it’s important to get the message out ✌️
