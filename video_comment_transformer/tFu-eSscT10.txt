Heyheyheyy community!! I just started playing in early August, now I've been blessed with multiple rerun banners! I'll definitely pull for Lingsha but I need your suggestions on who should I pull between Kafka, Robin, Black Swan, or Topaz
6 character banners in total?? time to start looking for a sugar daddy

So... no 10 pulls anymore?
ALL THESE RERUNS IN ONE PATCH?

How about march 7 missing 3 edilions? 😢😢😢
1000 jades and 10 fules is this a dream
Really? 3 Characters I want ALL AT ONCE?
seele and silverwolf are limited charactheres? they never rerun 😢
Honki Star Rail WHY IS POISED TO BLOOM A HARMONY LIGHTCONE
Owlbert is asking to get turned in fried chicken with phase 1.
Topaz is getting another re-run, didn’t she just have one in 2.2???
Only 1000 free jades?  C'mon now don't be stingy with them, make it at least 1600 for 10 pulls.
We just skipping 2 rerun and going straight to 3?
Wait, if moze is coming in phase 1, then why is his signature weapon arriving in phase 2? That's so weird... unless I'm missing something?

Honestly. Why did it yave to be all High value Reruns?
No aventurine?……Time to keep Saving👍🏼
SKILL ISSUE MODE?!
What are those banners...
They really added a skill issue mode
Could be a Foxian or a Pepeshi or something surprising like if Herta's real body looks like this if she is a liar about her puppet designs.
