now with the new season coming up will we finally get the oliver stark puppy interview? i really need that!
BUCK HAS AN ACCENT???
Ig I'm just wondering how yall pick the tweets. Do you have categories of thirsty or something?
Who are these people
My goodness. Can they just kiss already?
So positive, friendly guy-guy interactions are seen as flirting now? Y’all are strange.
And women complain about men sexualising???? Y’all do the same shit 😂
What is this Girl shit??? It kills the man vibe.
It’s so weird seeing buck not speaking like buck, does that make sense? 🤔
Ive been watching this video for like 2 weeks now and doesn't end... it is supposed to be this long?
Buzzfeed what do we have to do to get a part 2 🙏
do they know its legal?
Next puppy interview???  Didn't know oliver had n accent soundsss nice!!
Where is the puppy interview
come on buddie. why keep dragging them writers, tim? come on already
where is the second part?
why are these grown men flirting with each other like highschoolers and why am i giggling and kicking my feet like hello
Both raw at the same time, next question
why are they so flirtyyy
How is it that ryan and oliver have more views than a lot of these videos that's been posted a month and more ago? The power of buddie.
What Show Are They In Together?
Why is the english begging an American accent
@BuzzFeed  Angela Bassett when? Either for your kittens thing or this. You need her.
OMG.. Ryan asking 'my waist is slutty?' In a very sexy voice 🥵
Do they know that there are more comments that are about them 'together'?
Why do I feel like I'm interrupting something 🤨
What show is this?
Buzzfeed fell off, these interviews used to be fun.  They did NOT include one single thirst tweet, the tweets they choosed were boring and not thirsty at all… like bring us old good buzzfeed thirst tweets WHAT HAPPENED?
what happened Oliver's eye
did abc purposefully make oliver the 9-1-1 spokesperson because they wanted a human shield to avoid criticism of that godawful finale? he's just an actor, the real problem is abc and the showrunners.
so buzzfeed when are you dropping the uncut and bts footage of this ???
For what length of time can you hold your breath?  Excuse me, sir. 😛😛😛
how long can you hold your breath??! excuse me SIR 😛😛😛
Puppy interview next!!!
Did Joyce interview them? We need that asap if she did ❤
How much do you think Oliver weighs?
Why are they flirting
Now release the uncut version. Please? 🥺
Anyone else’s mind blown cause they didn’t know Buck was British?! 🤯
6:53 so puppy interview with oliver stark when??
... who's going to tell them they were just flirting with each other this whole episode? 🤣 I've never seen Ryan so red before 🤭And the way he was so shy to read the last tweet and Oliver being so confident with it was just chef's kiss 🤣
This could have been the puppy interview
Who r these men and where can i buy one xxxxx
Why is this 2 hrs long 😃
Buzzfeed whats going on? where are the thirst tweets? These are tame as hell. Im gonna take back my like LOL
When will Peter Krause thirst tweets happen??
How does he not remember the fridge calendar? Bball with Tommy was CIRCLED
So… when is Oliver’s puppies interview??
is this the PG version before the good one comes out? lol
How do you feel? Like I’ve been ran through. I’m sure he said more but “ran through” was really all I needed
Ryan guzman was in step up 4? Right?
"ahem next question 😭" that's the sound of a spoiler NDA baby
Can yall do this with Eric and Melissa I wanna see them read their thirst tweets lol 😂
So when are the writer just gonna give up and make them a couple or I guess once the views drop they’ll give us what we really want 😅
Is their gonna be a part 2 👀🤭
Puppy video or kitten video please? I want to see these two covered in them. It would be adorable!
do they know it's legal
why did they start blurring the tweet handles
are they lovers?
What happened to the area around Oliver's left eye? Did he ever explain?
But do they know about Their Nicknames Clifford The Big Red Bisexual and Homotron 3000
How is this the only one of these that didn't feature the word "bussy"?
Can we have a part 2 or a puppie interview with them both again?
