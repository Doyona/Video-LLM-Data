Is it bad that I've watched this 7 times in a row?
Is that 300fpm touch down?
I wonder how they felt inside that 🤣
the spoilers get fully deployed although the plane bounces back in the air. was it done manually to avoid another bounce or eventually a go around? great catch Mr Big Jet TV keep up the great work and commentary 😄👍🏻
Was someone behind you?
Wind shear just above the ground ?
i thought this was at EGLL but were they landing on 09L or 27L? and where was it filmed from?
😂 was the cameraman a passenger too?
Bottom dropped out... Maybe Wind Shear?
Does he need a wash cloth now?
Just a minor check if everyone had clicking the belts correctly.
Anybody know the registration number of that jet??
A bit of over controlling from the copilot there, I think ?
Don't they all land like that?  Maybe I should pay more attention...
RyanAir: Hmmm...how can we top that?
Bumpy landing? Too much wind sheer! Saw this with your YouTube coverage .
seems easy peasy,  didn't randy quaid and wife squat around in Hollywood???  😂😂😂😂😂
Arnold Horshak moved to London?
I wonder what caused that ?? Wake Vortex or Cross Wind Gust ?? Pilot was keeping left wing down and the wind paused for a few seconds??
Still wondering how this wasn’t a go-around, wild.
Where are those anti seatbelt people now?
Do we have footage from inside?
Can you imagine what that would have felt like did they record it ?
Ooh stop it?
0:27 Never mind the crosswind landing , who was it that was indecently assaulting him and why didn’t he stop?
How does something this heavy get blown about like paper. Make you think.
ARE THAT USER RECORDED WAS SICK OR WHAT?.. ITS HARD TO HEAR IT... 😮😮😮REALLY... HOW OLD ARE YOU GOSH.....
Im so pleased you made the mainstream media,  i wonder if this can be made into a gif? My family gave me a very old fashioned look when they heard me playing this
Sounded like an unrequited backscuttle.
do you need some tissues ??
What is NFP?
Was it good for you Jerry?
how was that not a go around
Was that Juan?
Imagine texting someone and being interrupted by such substandard  piloting. Now really?
Would that be recorded as a hard landing by the black box?
Sneezed on flare?
What runway were the pilots using and what were the winds?
That was rather extreme, say what?!!!
Was captain asleep (sleep inertia)? TOGA!!
Was it the pilot being super aggressive with the controls? I see a massive nose down input.. Maybe caught off guard?
According to Flightradar, this AA134 did two procedure turns north of Heathrow on approach to EGLL before landing on runway 27 , so I'm wondering if fuel was running low, causing the pilot to proceed with the landing instead of breaking away for a go-around once they ran into windshear (or whatever caused the problem). Great newsworthy shot, Jerry.
Whats the best viewing spot for Heathrow? Might pop over tomorrow if i get a chance.
Does anybody know why he gave the left input it looked like he was on track to have a decent landing. Was he trying to touch the left landing gear first as some pilots do?
how did didn't they do a go-around that was insane
Are you straight out of the monkey enclosure at chester zoo 😂
What's insane about that? Surely the lunatic shouting Oh Oh Oh but the landing looked pretty rational.
What was the flipping ???
No "flippin heck"?? Is everything okay? 😂
And people wonder why US airlines suck
Insane landing. Just wonder how many fpm for that touchdown.?
wonder if there was any swearing in the cockpit taking place 😁things like " o deary me " lol
Was a big bounce there... , wonder what it was like inside....
For those wondering, the bird in question N719AN subsequently took off only slightly late on its onward flight to Dallas. Hopefully it was given a proper look over and clean bill of health first!
What the hell happened there !
You have to wonder the amount of force coming down on that front gear when he did that, hundreds of thousands of pounds on a single gear wow
why does Heathrow seem to have so many of these?
OMG , that was scary 😶 I bet the passengers were shaken ! How did he get the nose down?
How the hell did they get that down? 99% of other pilots will have given it the TOGA thrust and go around
Fly by wire help old chap ?
