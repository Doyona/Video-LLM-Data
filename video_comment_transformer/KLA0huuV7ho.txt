How many waiting for Shoba elimination and feeling that Bigboss backing up her in every situation.. i am unable to watch Shoba akka ..Big boss you should respect people opinions..
I am asking a straight question about all Amar supporters who are the best Amar or Prashanth .. I feel Prashanth is Super .begging points not game ..Winning the game is Victory ..doesn't matter how many points we earn ..Winning hearts matters ❤
How many Get sad after Watching Yawar Tears 😢😢
I didn't understand that when shobha and shivaji given full points to Amar... why Priyanka and yawar given half points only..
Why 130 points only??
Some housemates testing gauthams patience😊still he is proving us strong
