what else?? 😁
Is just me or Ice prince kinda went off tune or beat? Sark nailed it no cap. Yung L big ups
"iworiwo" is that not Flavour's slang?, Naija to Africa. Ghanaians too dey use our slangs, later they will say we stole it from them.
Did sark just throw another jab?just asking though😂❤  🔥🔥🔥
Did any Ghanaian hear Abontii (outside) in the corus? Or my ears are deceiving me...
Everybody try but I want to know why ice prince will talk about ice on the neck and not have one on in the video lol
No be this pub sark shot his rollies and cigars videos? Looks familiar
