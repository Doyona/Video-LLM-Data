Why is her voice so raspy like "I remember when they invented chocolate ☹️" but she's a child... sounding like she chain smoked for 30 years during ww2
Can we mention about how the actor for Sydney Lou who in the Grinch is now a rockstar in a band? There has been more severe changes.
Is this the one that got demonitised/Jo Jo's team stole the money??
5:12 am i crazy or is the music from the tf2 soundtrack
12:03 Is that a pole in your living room? I am so jealous. Hahaha
Wait the anime is getting live adaptation???
5:07 wait…is that what I think it is?
I’ve always been confused as to how she orchestrated a paparazzi shoot to catch her outside of a sex store and somehow managed to choose the most child friendly object you could get from one of those stores to be photographed with.
ITS ALMOST BEEN A YEAR SINCE THIS HAs HAPPENED??????????
I know this is an old video (great video btw), but IS THAT IN SPACE WITH MARKIPLIER ENGINEER MARK MERCH BACK THERE??? I got the Yancy tee, and recognized the style!!
0:11 Why Does Jojo Sound Like Donnie Thornberry On Cocaine?
who the fuck are you and who is jojo i don't understand any of these
Is this a jojo refrence
Was I the only one who expected an essay on how JoJo's bizzare adventures is getting weird and got disappointed...
wtf america you ok?
A twinge? This is a 50 gallon drum of cringe
am i the only idiot that thinks she looks like the rock en roll troll from the movie trolls 2 when she is in her outfit.
what was that twinge of cringe 😭😭😭😭
6:15 WHY DID THE LIKE BUTTON LIGHT UP???
7:52 is that a T-shirt with her face?
6:57 please tell me I'm not the only on that realized the coryxkenshin song
jojo reference in a video about JOJO? ain't no fucking way everything really is a jojo reference after all
Chad “Jo…..” Me “…. Mama?” Chad “mama.” Me *victory air punch*
Don't wanna be weird but reeeeeally wanna know what foundation you use cos your skin is flawless girl ❤
Is she sick? does she need help?
4:33 WAS THAT CLUB PENGUIN GAME DAY MUSIC?
Did anyone tell you you’re a natural born dancer
9:44 what is the music
Wasn’t this longer?
Never grew into that head, did she?
omg did chad have to edit out her live karma reaction out of this video?? 😭😭 its not here anymore
whats the metal song at 6:08 ?
Anyone notice that the video changed? Her reaction to JoJo's MV is gone and the video's shorter now. Cease and desist? Copyright issue?
Am I the only one who feels very bad for her? She was under very high pressure since shes able to stand. Every little step of her was watched in television. OF COURSE she is behaving weird now. She has no clue how to be her own person.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REACTION IN THE END WHY IS IT GONE????
11:51 Wasn't here a full video about you reacting to Karma? Did you get copyrighted??
As a French (i guess socialist compared to your criteria) ... how about NOT EXPLOITING KIDS? that could avoid these really awkward moments.
WAIT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DANCING
Why is she dressing like 2008 Jeff hardy?
O my god, they seriously copyrighted the video? 🤦‍♀️
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO why was the final dance cut? :((((
How does she not know that she looks like a kiss member wannabe
Chadchad full dance video when? (love your vids btw)
Can content youtuber just once come up with an original idea. Jojos rebrand really doesnt need five different videos from five different creators who all talk about the same shit. She dresses differently now, who the fuck cares?
Is she wearing a shirt with here face on it? What the hell?
Shane Dawson the pedo?
Anyone noticed she has a cage for her dog... is that normal? I think only a pi*c* of sh*t of human being would do that.
Hold on, cause as much as she doesn’t deserve my defense, can we really blame a 13 year old girl for having asbestos in a product that literally just has her face on it? If anything we can blame her managers, but I mean I doubt she even knows what it is let alone purposefully puts it in her products. I’m just saying
I dont get how someone decides on a completely new look, but keeps that awful chav ponytail 😂
does she know that karma has been released a thousand times before. also why is she a bad girl if she can’t even say fuck. 😭
So when are child stars going to just be outlawed? They rarely, if at all, turn out sane
What part of Jojo is this?
Who chooses Harvey over Sebastian?
why is it when girls wanna be edgy they just commit acts of lesbianism 😭
Miley ran so Jojo could do... whatever this is. Crawl maybe?
They call this edgy? 🤣
Who?
If Sam Smith tried it and failed miserable...what makes her think she'll pull it off?
Is that a Jojo (Siwa) reference⁉️⁉️⁉️
Why does it look like she’s in the kiss band
Why does it look like she has a Confucius beard
Can we stop calling marketing windows ‘era’s’ yet?
Why would a lesbian want a giant stuffed dick thingy?
Am i tweaking or are you playing archimedes in the background
Why does Jojo Siwa voice sound so raspy and not in a good way
whats the song that plays at 4:55 from
does chad chad have a gaming channel? please chad chad if u dont invest in one .. for me❤
Chad Chad smooching on Stardew Harvey isn't a topic in the comments section and that's alarming to me. Was I meant to know this? 😭😂
Am I allowed to think that Chad Chad is pretty? Or is that demeaning and reductive?
Quarter life crisis
Why’s your camera looked so washed?
What is this editing
Omg is that kiss’s sister?! 😰😨😱
Who is this for? Strictly from a business perspective, who is her target audience? It doesn't seem to be young kids anymore but teenagers would probably think this is cringe. 20 somethings are definitely not fucking with it. I don't understand who this is for!
Maybe she should should not have been abused her whole life.
I wonder if you'd be funny doing stand up?
So is this an 'emo' phases for this gen or something??
Is this gonna be what ryan from ryan’s workd will turn into when he grows up?
10:27 Wait, is this a jojo reference!?
Are you gonna give the earbuds to Laura?
Not excusing JoJo or her mom, I am curious why that child was even trying to dance with having such risky and severe surgery recently. That's madness
She was weird as hell before and so why are we now shocked 🤔
How can u still be hot in a freaking deer camouflage shirt
9:47 is this a modern ways to summon element 🤣🤣
JOJO, HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING??
Whys is there a rolling black bar on  the screen
wait why does she has a pp plushie? i thought she was gay? i also don't know if im joking or not
Why would parents raise their children like a Jojo if they were going to end up like Jojo
Why is Chad so hot
Can we talk about how it's not even her song? It was originally recorded and performed by Brit Smith in, like, 2010 or something.
why does jojo talk with the exact intonation and cadence as mark L walberg in the cody ko/kelsey interview? but for jojo to be talking about a song that apparently wasn't even hers in a rebranding arc that has been done so many times, even using it as a punchline in sitcoms is a trope,,,,,,,,, not to mention all the allegations about XOMG................ girl u have no right to be this smug
2:18 IS SHE BALD?
Is that a bad girl snail trail running down her chest?
Isnt she 22 too? 😅
Am I the only one living for it? Like I'm sorry that it's not cringy to me but I grew up watching Trisha Paytas & Jeffrey Star...you can't scare me 🤪 I love drama like this cause it feels like 2021 all over again lmao
There have been two references to the FNaF analog horror series in the last two videos, is Chad Chad a secret FNaF fan?!
Did we learn nothing from Hussie????
Should anyone care?
Why does JoJo sound like shes smoked 2 packs a day for 20yrs?
is she a biker for "The Humungus" from Mad Max 2.. his best friend lol got killed by the kid who had the boomerang!! ah also found a new channel to sub to and more videos to watch and like.. ty Chad Chad
Whi is "Jessica" Siwa??
What is the difference between Jojo Siwa and the children my basement?              Jojo Siwa came out.
Don't you think this video is bullying?
do you think jojo has like sleep walking but for dancing?
How can she go through a rebrand when she acts the exact same just in different outfits
My granddad had that exact same shirt idk how to feel about this
who is this husky girl? what is with the bows?
Can you please talk about tiktoks KAPOW MEGGINGS (yes, mens leggings)?!?!?!
didn't she literally steal that song word for word from another artist?
just an off topic.. after seeing ALL haley edits on tiktok.. what do you think about it?
show us more bones
She's trying SO hard to be a gay icon. When will she realize it isn't something you work towards, it's something that just happens 🙄
why is Jojo being so bizarre?
Proof narcissistic personality disorder isn’t always something one is born with??
Okay... How does she not know who Gene Simmons is 😭
You know, i had always thought jojo siwa's whole thing was just a persona. Like behind the neon and bows there's a normal mature person who has normal interests and stuff. But like? This whole thing seems so childish in the way she approaches trying to look like an adult it makes me wonder if she's ever gone outside
I just wanna know why she still puts her hair up so high
11:05 wait she had surgery and went? Ahhh sounds like a skill issue
Where do I get one of those sick ass deer shirts you have?
9:46 Omfg Chad Is The AVATAR??
If she did nothing and just changed… it’d probably be something we take a bit more seriously, but her hype over it and her complete blindness to the fact that many many MANY other people have gone through changes like this.  It honestly comes off as a bit of a money grab and that makes me question her sexuality… was it influenced by social media and the desire for attention.
Is that the Stanley parable elevator music in the background?
Okay, I feel like I have to bring this up as a point of genuine concern, is her voice okay?? In nearly every video I've heard from her, she sounds very congested or like she's straining to speak. This is not a person I feel like should be singing, I just want to give her some throat tea and tell her not to overdo it..
is it just me or is chadchad calmer
chadchad is the avatar?!
Last day of being a child star? Babes i think you meant to say last day of being a star...
I can't figure out this math problem Did you try breaking it down?  Ah shit, gimme a minute  9:53
Why is ChadChad talking about edging?
Stardew valley mentioned??
Does anyone else miss the old “twinge of cringe” voice 😔😔 (STILL LOVE THE NEW ONE THOOO)
I know she’s young but surely she remembers Miley’s bad girl era? She cant possibly think she’s outdoing that
She doesn’t know who’s look she entirely ripped off??? It’s literally a rip off of exactly gene Simmons look.
Didn't jojo befriend and defend colleen ballinger, a literal pedo?!!
I'm scared of her voice, does she do it for purpose?
Is this the Robin Daggers-style of transformation?
10:00 Is that from Mortal Kombat (its the only game i know that has those x-ray parts in a scene)?
chad chad omg i remember seeing your older video on those ads on tiktok about the those weird trashy alpha wolf beta series whatever tf it’s called right,? it’s popping up EVERYWHERE in my fyp again, and they added more to that series apparently? can you do a part two on it PLSS , ily chady chad chad mwah
Does Jojo think that being gay is a crime... still?
I can’t decide if she wants to be a member of kiss or a professional wrestler perhaps the crow.
before i watch, can someone tell me if she plays the song? I have a medical condition and I can't listen to it. I love chadchad, but if the song gets played, I gotta pass. Lemme know
Wow how do you dress in what is essentially a Kiss costume but not even ever heard the name Gene Simmons,  that's actually wild... I really think her mom mighta chose the outfit but who knows
Did you get your raycon sponsor money?
How much does JoJo smoke and drink? Her voice sounds like a 50 year old chain smoker. Or cocaine? Overall it could end more like the Lindsey Lohan transformation.
Why's everyone always hating on women who just try new things and don't care a lot about y'all's opinion! Get over yourself and let her explore and express herself.... I'm so tired of people hating on women that are doing basically nothing to hurt anyone....
Random european core question, why do your dogs sleep in cages?? is that common in America?? kinda weird (sorry lmao)
Is it just me or does Jojo seem like a female version of Jack Paul? I mean that in the worst possible way
Was that a mother fucking jojo’s referance? (I’m sorry guys I had to )
Is it me or does it sound like never gonna give you up
If she was uncomfortable to sing lyrics on her own song then isn't that just admitting that you don't write these songs, don't believe in the message, aren't actually expressing yourself? Like how could something that's honestly coming from you, as an artist, be something you're uncomfortable with? I mean nobody has accused Siwa of being original but this is just embarassing how many times we've seen young pop stars make this exact same pivot.
She's still behaving like a child, where's the bad part?? 🤣 I think her singing on her car was more scary 🤣🤣
So not an obscure anime show? Okay, good to know.
Am I the only one who thinks Jojo Siwa is just another dipshit artist that started as a plant in the industry when she was young?
What's more exploitative, dances moms or Lizzo?
Isn’t that the girl who was a ballerina or something other with dancing who had such a tight bun that she started to  loose part of her hair?
why harvey?
So JoJo, why would miley be part of queer pop? I think thats just a straight cis woman. 😂
What is the beginning of Cameron transition transition from child star to adult literally leafed nudes like I’m not saying that’s right or anything but I don’t know people have taken harder turns before jojo lol
is this a jojos reference?
Why is the female child star to ‘bad girl’ transformations just some uninspired lazily skimpy ‘objectify me’ costume? Stop being the typical ‘bad girl’ and do something actually creative, not just ‘sexy’ if you can even call it that 🤮
Ok, what sing is she stealing, this time?
You wanna look into my mind
Am I the only one that thinks she looks like Lana Del Ray?
Why does JoJo have the voice of a 50 year old life long smoker as a 20 year old?
where did you get that shirt?
Me watching this video wondering how you get your dog to chill in its kennel. Maybe it’s a breed thing, but my chihuahua would NEVER.
I'm confused. Why is Britney Spears cosplaying as Gene Simmons?
Also why is no-one talking about how this entire song is literally stolen. It's a Brit Smith song from 2012. Jojo did not write this. What a bad girl.
can you send me the link to find that picture of the old man going like 🤫 right before the sponsor
Can we just stop talking about it and let her career die faster?
when does the EP of you voice over come up on the Spotify? because that was (( checks notes for what the kids say these days )) lite.
Please tell me im not the only one who thinks the weird chin makeup that goes down her neck looks like a beard😭😭😭 WHAT IS THAT THERE FOR
Day 655 of asking Chad Chad to be my girlfriend 😢 I’m a normal cool 26 year old dude just give me a chance
Can we stop making the wrong people famous?
😆Why's it so dark?
anyone can recommend yt channels like this?
so does she make music
its all so.... corprorate? and frankly that goth/glam rock/??? corpse makeup??? is just kind of.... kidz bop vibes......
not knowing who gene simmons is is truly wild tbh 💀💀💀
What made y'all hate her so bad I'm genuinely curious
2:10 the phrasing in this? "may" ?? like she probably made this list before thinking of the themes. why not just "the following content contains..." why "may"??
Why does jojo sound like she’s eaten a dozen packs of cigarettes
Not sure if she's actually a lesbian or not, but either way, when are people gonna stop thinking girl on girl is edgy?
Anyone else think her new song sounds like an Alvin and The Chipmunks mix?
guys joho is sm else right?
but why is it just the toxic music video on a yacht instead of a plane? and surprisingly... also with more rhinestones?! ahahahaha
Wait. Olivia Rodrigo is from the Disney Channel? I thought she was just a regular young artist not a pipeline product. Not that it matters, just surprised.
Why do some people exist?
did she not learn anything from the dream face reveal thing. The more you hype up the audience for a normal thing, the more you gonna be trolled T_T I feel bad for her but she set this up to fail.
Harvey? You wanna smooch HARVEY? (Wait, is that the bit?) 😂
can we talk about her precious  dog that looks kinda like scooby do 12:15 ?
why is it so dark?
Nobody knows what's happening? Jojo I'm trying not to but fuck I know more than I already want to
Please do a follow up talking about the plagiarism rumors? cuz apparently all of her new music is a carbon copy of existing songs.
Why are we not talking about the deer shirt?  I don't know what to say about it, per se, but I feel like it warrants a conversation
Why does she have a raspy 40 year old voice at the age of 20?
chad chad can u do a video about those girls that attacked that other girl who glued on piercings?
Why do I feel like JoJo Siwa is just becoming a baby Ellen Degeneres?
midlife crisis at 20
Is everyone wayching this 12? Ive seen a few videos of JoJo so this was recommended to me and its the least informative, least original.. and downright lazziest video ive seen.. yet somehow has the most views..  wtf?
Was that a JoJo reference?
no but why that part in the music video where they are on like an island(??) looks so much like if Rihanna's Umbrella was bad
So real question, What are your thoughts on flushed away? How has it affected your life?  👨🏼‍💼*Photo of Chris Pratt
People do know there were gay people before Lady Gaga right?
Bro why did she delete all her old videos like I’m trying to watch her review some bows😭😭
So wait, what's the dance even for? If it's for a music video... bro, practice for like one 5 hour session, film, be done. If it's for stage performances... why is she doing the exact same dance as everyone else?
I didn't get thanked for watching. Where's my validation?
I wonder how gene simmons feels about his female temu counterpart 💀✋
I'm glad she played the video cause I was questioning giving jojo my view
Can we please retire the off-camera cat joke with the same damned sound effect since 1990? That cat's been dead for decades.
5:14 IS THAT BACKGROUND SONG ARCHIMEDES??? FROM THE TEAM FORTRESS 2 SOUNDTRACK???  THE SONG FROM TF2???? HELLO??????? 😭😭
the song is weird because it’s a song someone would produce after they went through a messy and very public breakup, did that happen to jojo siwa? am i that out of the loop?
omg was that a jojo reference??
Did she not do her outro ? What a shame for the chad comunity.
Whatever happened to Maddie? I always thought 🤔 she was going to be the one making videos.. jojo is too much for me
what in the theater kid is this?
How can she not know who Gene Simmons is?!  That's like a dedication to ignorance when you literally work in the music industry.
Please tell me the difference between gay pop and pop.
aaa were your videos always going at the ADHD speed of johnny test? i am overwhelmed lmao
didnt she steal the song from some other artist?? im pretty sure the song isnt even hers
Sure this isnt all a cover up? Like iNabber said?
wait so if shes the “gay pop icon” then why does she have a d*ck plush
Harvey???  the broke older guy who is into planes, coffee and telling you unsolicited advices to eat healthier ?
Random conspiracy time: what is up with this song? Seriously. Everyone I talk to says they heard it once and then it immediately got stuck in their heads for hours/days/a week. I also did not ask for it to be played endlessly in my YT shorts. Why is this song so easily taking over people’s minds and who did she pay for it to ALSO take over our feeds??? Everyone is talking about her and I never wanted to care but suddenly I do. wtf??
Should we even give attention to this kind of "artist"?
OMFG CHAD CHAD IS THE AVATAR?!?!? 9:46
Did she forget lil nas x giving Satan a lap dance?
also, isn't that song, like, almost completely stolen from another artist?
Your dog chills in his crate with the door open too? If I leave my dogs kennel open, he goes in. However, it's usually after he's peed somewhere he's not allowed to pee so I guess he puts himself in timeout on purpose
Why is Markiplier just staring in the corner and why did you not use his image for click bait
"What's been in your head the last 3 days?"      THIS JUICE CLEANSE WAS A BAD IDEA!!
how is she gonna sit there like “I want to invent a new genre of music” and then LIST EXAMPLES OF MUSIC THAT ALREADY EXISTS??
I feel like… why would you name your single karma when one of the biggest pop stars in the world just released a hit single called karma not even two years ago?  Like… I’m not even a Swiftie but I’d be scrambling to change that.
If everyone hates it, why are y'all milking it for content instead of just ignoring her? But rather give her more attention. Like, I'm not a fan but I also don't like the idea of the whole Internet going against one person.
Didn't dove cameron also do... exactly this? The gay bad girl arc except she was actually hot 😭🙏
I don't even get what's supposed to be the edgy part. That she kissed a girl? I guess that might be controversial in some very conservative circles, but that's definitely not rare to see in media today. It's not really rare to see a gay character in a TV-series, for an example.
Does Jojo realise that even Swifties think the talking part of Look What You Made Me Do is cringy as hell?
omg where did you get this giant dinosaure plushi ?????    yes I am aware I don't know how to spell pushy-plushi-plushie aaaaah
hey can you super please do a video about dance moms lol derp :3 PLEASE I'M ON MA KNEES  Thank You! lol derp :3 (this is not how i talk in real life)
8:30 am I hearing some a hat in time there?
Who's gonna tell her she can't sing its giving look at me energy
I wonder if this extreme rebrand thing that happens, isn't on purpose to make the real rebrand do better.
am i the only one thinking of Sarah Lynn from Bojack Horseman?
Why does a car rapping make me so inexplicably happy
Why does the red one on the beach kinda look like a bloody tampon..
Does she have friends? Like I'm serious. Or anyone that can ground her a bit and tell her to chill. I feel bad for her honestly.
Why you in such a rush to end your videos like girl let me get my hand out from my blanket first
3:29 internet help me. What sound is that?? I cant put my finger on it, but i know it from somewhere.
Where's the hand close up + thanks for watching? The deal is you feed us cringe then heal us with a hand wave to close out. WHERE IS MY HEALING?! WHERE IS MY CLOSURE?!
Is anybody surprised, I mean sincerely surprised?
This is completely unrelated but liking Harvery from Stardew Valley is completely valid, I've been obsessed with him for years now >:D
6:20 why is she wearing candy corn😂😂😂😂
Who… even is this person. And why is she not in a mental institution
With how fake everything is about her, im actually wondering if shes even really a lesbian or if that too is a tactic to gain attention. Im not saying that to be homophobic, im gay myself, it just seems like she wouldnt be beyond doing that.
Long time fan, but I have to ask - did you lift this from Frogbait or did they lift it from you?
isnt gay pop already a thing also would this song even be considered gay pop
When the hell is mother's day in America?
Is this like her 2007 Britney era???
Harvey? Really?
Is it me or is Jojo doing something weird with her voice
This is not an attempt at rebranding, she's trying to be a cringelord on purpose in order to generate this "silly-goofy" press, and distract from the allegations regarding her very own children's dance show. 😭
What about the kids 😂
Why is she making out with herself lol
wait but how do you get the hot balloon cutscene with harvey
why does she sound like muscle man’s girlfriend?
im gonna cry how is chadchads dance better than jojos😭
Mothers day is coming up????? Oh D:
Why does rebranding as an “adult” have to always include , sex, alcohol ,partying and more sex, is there nothing better to do? Like I’m so tired of it 😭
Why do I like the karma in their video more than the normal one?
What ever happened to Jojo siwas dog??
Fr tho why is she humping woman with her “boomerang”?? 😭
8:54 HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO GENE SIMMONS IS & YOU'RE IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY?? LOOL
I honestly love her new outfit? Am I weird? Like it doesn’t match jojo but it’s kinda great?
why did I read this title as "JoJo Siwa's Edgy Bra"? I thought she had also released some sort of "fashion" line and then I watched the video and felt really dumb
She's just copying other people, or am I crazy?
when is the copyright free karma coming to spotify I wanna listen to the full song
When is the Chad Chad cover album dropping?
JoJo JoJo? What? No MoJo Jo Jo references?
someone tell me why whenever i saw the photo of jojo leaving with the giant plushie that _i thought the plushie was in the bag i genuinely did not see the actual plushie until __11:48__ of this video and i've seen a couple videos with people talking about this photo_
It's not badass gear she has on. That's just another dance costume. Maybe she should take some time to figure out who she really is and then showcase that but the costume thing is giving desperation.
Bro was I the only person who thought 7:08 was a coryxkenshin video reference?
love the video but HARVEY???? HARVERY???? why????/lh  Edit: never mind i went through his storyline and i love this man, he’s literally one of the girls and i love him for that 👏
ChadChad, great video and all but, Is your leg ok? Please let us know as soon as possible.
7:39 why is she moving like that 😭
Wtf is that
Absolutely not related to the video in the slightest but did anyone else notice the In Space with Markiplier poster on the floor leaning on the wall? I deadass went "ooo ooo 👆👆👆" lmfao
I’m sorry I know this is off topic but HARVEY??? REALLY??????? Literally the worst bachelor in SD
Was this a jojo reference
ChadChad? JoJo?  I'm seeing a pattern here
Chad Chad? No, Dance Dance:)
How tf does she not know one the most iconic bands ever Kiss? Even young people know who they are.
did she delete the vid?
Is she trying to emulate Lady Gaga, or Kiss?🤨
Is this a... Jojo reference!?!
Is Joja Siwa just permanently going to tie her hair until her hairline perishes into another dimension
In the black silver sparkling mess she kinda looks like a female 80’s ladies of Glow wrestler? Like
I get wanting to break away from the crooked ponytail and bow wearing persona from when you were younger, but just be your normal self now that you’re older?  Why do you have to have a knockoff Kiss outfit? Why do you have to jump from one look to another look? Just be 21 year old Jojo or whatever and figure out who you want to be 🤷🏻‍♀️
Does she not know KISS? Because that's so funny
idk who you are but you have a new subscriber cs why are u so funny and pretty ??? 🧍🏻‍♀️🧍🏻‍♀️
Was Jojo too young to remember how Miley was naked on a recking ball, because I feel like it was a way bigger transition.
Harvey is taking over all the girlies this week, what’s his secret?
Y’all she’s so young and was raised in a berating Hollywood environment aren’t we being a bit harsh and not acknowledging how difficult it must be to escape the crippling perfectionist complex she probably developed as a child on dance moms?
I still have no idea who this person is
"gay pop", tf? you know what song is technically gay pop? friday. friday by rebecca black is gay pop
Why does she remind me of KRIS?
I get that it's weird, but should we be piling on to a woman that's been in the public eye since she was a child...
No idea who this girl is
Did the title have “ugly” instead of “edgy” in it, or did I hallucinate that?
"What's been in your head the last three days?" Suicidal ideation. JoJo. Thanks for asking.
The fact that KPOP music vids don't have a 60 fps option while a reaction/commentary video does is baffling to me
What was going on with her tv and the black lines on it can anyone explain?
YOU KNOW OR PLAY STARDEW VALLEY girl this game is so underground and underrated
But can we talk about how they almost break each other’s pelvises by doing The Worm onto each other, chest first, while STANDING?
I just wanna know where Chad Chad gets her shirts
The girl group stuff sounds absolutely terrible but my question is why is a disabled girl with specifically muscle related issues wanting to join a dance heavy girlband? Am I missing something?
how many times have we seen this before
I was like why are y'all mad at a child but she's 20 years old apparently wow the progression of time doesn't even occur to me lol
I wonder if this is to distract everyone from the fact she and her mother abused children.
okay but if shes gay why did she go to a sex shop and buy that plushie
Why am I not surprised that Chad's favorite romanceable NPC from Stardew is Harvey? (Based btw, just like me fr fr)
Is this all just her distracting from her scandals,ie the rolling stones article?
HOLY SHIT?! IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?!!!
a child that was pushed into the limelight and was brought up on attention seeking not beeing mentaly stable? im shocked.
I'm sorry, HARVEY? There are so many men in Stardew Valley and you pick HARVEY??
Someone please help me. What is that music at 4:53 again? It makes me feel nostalgic but I can't recall what game it's from
"new song"??? maybe this one will have been written within the past decade
I just have one question, What was the warning for?? What is mature about this?? Is it the small clip of her thrusting upwards and flipping that girl in red while in the water? Or is it the face caressing she does to the two girls? IM CONFUSED, JOELLE!
Jojo uses “they/them” but also “bad girl”? Just asking here, I don’t know anything about them. I just personally prefer they/them as well but I would feel misgendered by “bad/good girl”.
how did she say she was inventing gay pop and then go on to mention artists who did it before her in the same breath??
Jojo have you learned nothing!??
Why jojo look like a supervillain from Henry danger💀😭
who's jessica siwa its jessalyn 😭😭
it’s weird how she only seems to have one ‘bad girl’ outfit as it’s seen in the music video and the promotions. is it really your new ‘style’ if you only wear one new thing?
what the fuck is happening
why is she acting like a powerful girls villain
Do you and Funky Frog Bait work together to plan your videos? 😮
Who is joe and what did they see
Is this TF2 music at 5:20
I've made my share of befuddling fashion decisions but I am a tad confused as to why she's decided to start dressing like a character from Mad Max. Very intriguing choice but like, go off I guess
why does she sound like a teenage boy with lung cancer???
I cannot fathom that she is like in her 20s. She looked maybe 10 in the boomerangs video and you’re telling me she’s not JUST turning 17???? why does she look so fucking young 😭
why does anyone care about Jojo? like Legit, she was just some cringe child youtuber who then made cringey shit music, now shes a young adult who still makes kids content and cringy music. Why any adult would pay her any attention is beyond me.
where's the dinosaur??????????? 😡😡😡😡🦖🦖🦖🦖
Long time fan here. Your name isn't Chad Chad ? Woah.
Is Chad Chad the avatar when doing the dance because if so you slayed
Are you sure she’s not an enemy stand user?
Was that a JoJo reference?
Absolutely not the point of the video, I know, but like... you like Harvey??
YOU LIKE HARVEY?? NOOOO 😭😭 sebby for life man 🫶🫶
Wait, when was pop straight?
I mean, that's all fun and good, but where the hell is the outro ChadChad? I feel incomplete without being thanked for clicking on your video out of all the videos out there!
Why is she holding a penis plushie when she’s a lesbian. Vulva erasure.
Why does it feel like her new career advisor is Shane Dawson?  Edit: That being said, I'm going to try to give Jojo Siwa some grace. She was indoctrinated into a hostile environment and is in many ways a victim as well. Maybe she needs to do this to figure out some things about herself, and maybe she'll realize that she has wronged and hurt people.  AND STOP HANGING OUT WITH SHANE DAWSON!
As a dancer, I don’t understand why she is constantly rehearsing the dance as if she has the biggest performance of her life coming up. It’s a music video, you have unlimited takes to get it right.
Is this a JoJo reference? Or am I stupid?
Where The Fuck Is CINDY!!!!!!!?????????????????
how is raycon still a thing?
Didn't she also steal the lyrics almost word for word from a different creator?
I have to wonder why she's doing this, given how well it went for Miley
The dance is terrible......looks like a bad dance dance revolution level doing a weird fake corey Feldman Micheal Jackson impression dressed like kiss conniption fit. Is she ok?Does she need some  meds?
Wait karma is already a song with EXACT lyrics???? JOJO EXPLAIN??
...... who?
So when’s the Chad Chad music video dropping?
Why everyone says it's siwa's song when it's just a bad cover?
Harvey? really, chadchad? out of all the stardew valley bachelors you chose Harvey?
so what's a total change?  pony tail and bright colors to changed pony tail AND dark colors 😎😎😎
Wait why is Chad Chad kinda cracked at dancing
But? I though JojonBenét Ramsey was dead.
Aang who???💀
Why does the song's instrumental sound like it belongs in Madness Combat?
Dream 🚬 guest 🚬 on 🚬 my 🚬 podcast?
She also apparently stole the song some say from a tiktoker others say from Miley Cyrus’s ghost wrighter idk which is true
is your version on spotify yet?
Fit looking like the Tron version of Miley Cyrus and no I do not know what that means
Why are the outro getting sadder when you say bye
Pls tell me where you got that shirt
She was so innocent but I don’t know what happened to her, maybe about dance’s mom trauma. We need more evidence and information!
why is this video very gray?
How is she going to break out of her child star era without having a public meltdown after being harassed by the media and paparazzi.
Has she always talked like she’s doing a Jake Paul impression? That’s all I hear when I see these clips
Were we expecting her to start being good? Were we expecting dance moms to be good people? No. But thanks Chadwick
Isn’t this a cover? I swear I’ve heard this a few years ago
She’s just trying to be the “TikTok baddie” but she’s just embarrassing her self are you not embarrassed?
A “bad girl” would be like a criminal? Is she gonna go on a crime spree? I’d be into tbh
Chad, did you just airbend a fart?
Jojo, have you learned NOTHING?!
If the music video had already been filmed, why was she still spending 12 hours a day practicing the dance?
What I don’t get is if she wanted so badly to distance herself from her old persona, why didn’t she at least let her hair down?? I feel like the forehead-exposed tight updo is one of her most recognizable features, so when I see her with it all tightly up while dressed in whatever she wears now, I can’t help but imagine a kid wearing their parent’s clothes or something 🤧🤧
6:25 "What's been in your head the last three days?" Karma's bitch from Brit Smith (2012)
Idk why but her edgelord look reminds me of Hades in the Descendants movies
Is it just me who could listen to Chad Chad for 1-3 hours straight?
who is this????
So it did have music AND video? :O Mindblowing! This has never been done before!
Not the Archimedes from the tf2 soundtrack???
Does jojo think shes rhe first and only lesbian?... honestly i wouldnt be surprised cuz shes lied and dtope so many other things maybe she really is trying to claim shes the only gay person
she’s having an identity crisis
DID YOU KNOW THIS SONG WAS ACTUALLY BOUGHT? it wasn't even originally made by her 😭
Ok, real talk.......can we get more videos of Bones?
Wait, Harvey, of all the NPCs?
She's turning into the Unknown from the Willy Wonka experience
Isnt the karma song like just a dtunt to distract from her controversy
Did JoJo get akumatized and we didn'tt know until recently ?
You'd think for being a part of Dance Moms, she'd have a better grasp on making a new dance. I guess there's a reason they didn't call it Dance Daughters
Ring any bells?
Jojo has been a litte ... quirky? these days.
JoJo see what?
Was that a sample from Porcelain Black (formerly Porcelain and the Tramps)?
5:27  OLIVA RODRIGO WAS IN BIZAARDVARK?!
Gurl Harvey? He is such a cheapskate xD
maybe jojo can use all that music money to buy some rogain
you too chad chad? the OTHER double name gal with crazy eyeliner? :p
Just one question: Who is JoJoSiwa?
Why does the song sound like something that would be in a gacha life music video from 2018
Only 7000 views in 7 minutes? Fell off
3:35 why is this guy such a cute patootie
all i can think of is what would abby lee miller think of this?
I wanna know when she was a "Bad girl" like when😭
Isn't she about miley cyrus' age when miley started acting insane? must be something about that age.
Is that a JoJo reference?
twinge if cringe has changed so much
WHY IS JOJO THE HUMAN EMBODIMENT OF INTENSE RASPING😭😭
Idk who that is
Dang 16 seconds??
Have you seen that she stole the WHOLE song
How do you say vehicular manslaughter guys
why is she doing this
You too now?
SECONDD !! Also, how did she go from 🎀 🪃  🌈 to.. 🖤 🏝️ 😝   like.. I’m uncomfortable
