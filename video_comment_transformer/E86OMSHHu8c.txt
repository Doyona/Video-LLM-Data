Where is sun and moon
I was at least expecting Freddy to be able to beat him. What is the moral of this story even?
Hey man, do you miss that one from FNAF 2 too?
THIS IS A FNAF SONG? WHAT?
Okay here me out… please reanimate basics in behavior with PGHfilms or maybe do it yourself search a few tutorials seeing how good this animation is… can you reanimate basics in behavior?
This always makes me wonder why they never replaced Bonnie. If the books are right about there being multiple Pizzaplexes, was Bonnie’s murder exclusive to that one Pizzaplex or did every Monty decide to kill every Bonnie? Was he threatening them and that’s why they didn’t replace Bonnie? Was Fazbear Entertainment just that lazy?
How was the epic
What could possibly be happening
How come I never commented whenever it first came out? To be honest even if this song didn't come out and I heard it somewhere else, I'd instantly say it's a Tombstone song.
Why did the ending remind me of king k rool
Am I the only one that doesn't think Monty killed Bonnie?
Could we get an instrumental version of this?
How many times have I reheard this song
0:44 was that bonnie doing Demo's Scottsman's Stagger?
was that a Giga Monty reference at the end?
I keep coming back to this song and I love it so much. Y'all does anybody else wonder how Coryxkenshin would react to this song considering how much he didn't like Monty in FNAF: SB😅🤣
1:27 why is this part kinda good
Why did I ignore this when it came out? This is very cool!
Was that a giga monty reference?
Is nobody gonna talk about the mimic in the background
Why does i think of legosi for some reason
Why is it so quiet? Like even on my max volume it's whispers
Is it weird why I wonder why they made Monty if he wasn’t one of the actual superstars
I wonder how he actually became famous if that was a dream?
The secret of the mimic song when?
0:21  did he just get murdered by the door, the door must be strong😂
At the end we see monty walking off but what if he's walking off to do same sins he saw in his imagination?
Still wonder how A CHILD killed him
Problems at work or school
I love all the little dances and easter eggs Monty does at 2:06 lol  - Gmod dance - Gangnam style - the macarana - YMCA - The Default Vrchat dance 😂 - it's getting better the more I'm looking lmao Wait is that the mimic behind the green screen??
I wonder what would happen if montey was saw by freddy and Roxy and chica before they weren’t ever friends?
2:09 have anyone not noticed the cleaner bot is looting at the older clean o vac it’s so cute
WHY DO YOU JUST DROP OUT OF NO WHERE AND WHY IS IT ALWAYS GOOD
before monty broke freddy in 1:46 doesn't he do the same bonnie pose after they rockstars separate from eachother in 0:40
Did any one else see the 67 in the background keep watching till you see it
Trying to piece to what genre of music is this.
Idk if anyone noticed but with each animatronic he destroys, he gets a new accessory
in the window at 1:03 it looks like the mimicc?!?!?!?!?!?!?
How do you get his glasses? before killing Roxy. 1:19
is this Montys past life before he killed glamrock bonnie
Why does his voice sound like monty’s voice way more than the actual monty voice?
This is cool, but is it lore accurate?
What if Gregory was in the suit 1:49
HOW BIG WAS THE BUDGEEET no, HOW MUCH SKILL CAN YOU HAVE, like daaam great song great animation, GREAT everything
Can anyone tell me what type of magic is happening in that bridge that starts in 1:16
at 1:16 the tone of the song changes to a different song sorta beat is this a reference to another song
2:07 giga monty reference??!!?
Can someone tell me why when I was watching a different video when it ended it showed me this but the thumbnail was the c00lkidd party skin from forsaken
Can you make FNaF 1 song Reprise?
how do you mfs never fucking miss
2:07 Why are there giga Monties?
The real question I'm thinking about is if Monty could actually take them all out in that fast of seconds?
Is ralsei a girl or boy idk what the hell most characters in deltarune are
Does anyone remember the echo from Crusher-P
2:07 was... was that the giga monty horde?
why is the audio more quiet than normal
monty poses
So can I get another W?
2:10  is that scene a reference to the Monty army glitch
Whats the music genre called??
1:03 I don't understand what is that in the upper lower corner?
2:00 Honestly, were they expecting him to come quietly?
1:04 The Mimic?
is it just me who noticed the mimic was here? 1:02 at the top left
Idk why but for me it sounds like a Toy Story song
why is it so quiet? but else i love the song
Is this the bay wire butcher?
0:44 why bro have demomans taunt???😂
whats the genre of the music? :D
Everyone sees the mimic behind the green screen? 2:05 JSDKFKJK
Am I the only person that noticed that Monty destroyed everyone except the daycare attendant
You should make a song about nosy after he’s finished
Is no one gonna talk about that Gator do the tv Time dance at 2:07
Does anyone notice that Monty changes appearances during the  parts when he killed everyone
what is ts
0:19 what are those lights called?
am i the only one who dont like this song?
2:07 Is that a Clean-O-Vac?
Am I the only one who thought that the multiple Monty’s could have been based on the Monty glitch?
Meanwhile:  Sundrop and Moondrop wondering why its so quiet all a sudden and where the others are..
what is that thing in the window at 1:04 ?
WAIT YALL AINT SEEING THE MIMIC BEHIND THE GREEN SCREEN????!??
Monty was consumed by darkness?!
Is gator cooking Freddy?
Did anyone catch Monty doing the gangnam style?
2:07 Whats giga monty doing here? :3
Could we get a textless version? I really wanna do the edit but the words are super distracting from the song I’m using—   Amazing animation!! Super well done and the song is superb!!!
Was that a giga Monty reference at the end?
Why Roxy instead of Foxy?
who remembers when there was no most replayed in this video?
Realistically why are people from wealthy backgrounds have the authority over 10 of thousand of people like we have voting for a reason but it’s only to decide who will represent us as a mass and not a individual
What do they feed these Fnaf animators? and also TLT making a song of one of my favorite character? I love this song.
Please tell me I'm not the only one who listens to the FNAF song playlist everyday!
Can I get permission to make a hour loop video of this?
2:06 IS THAT THE TENNA DANCE IN THE LOWER LEFT OR AM I TOO DELTARUNE BRAINROTTED
THE ANIMATIO?!?!??!?!M HEEELLOOOOOOO??????????????
2:07 why is there so many clones of Monty’s!?!?
Hey Evan, it’s me Cassidy I heard you said a bad word but I didn’t want to get you in trouble so I said what did you say?
Why is there so many Maltese
But what if Gregory didn't exist and Monty destroyed them all himself and subsequently fell down, losing his legs?
2:07 was this a Giga Monty Reference? :o
What If the end was Gregory committing several acts of robotic murder on Monty
Why can't we go back in time?
Might be the fnaf song of the summer?
what is ts
Idk know that monty could do this to bonnie....
Wat you mean by that
Does Anyone else want songs for the other animatronics in security breach now?
Why is nobody talking about how this is our first TLT song in like,YEARS?!
2:08 Is he making tiktoks in front of the green screen 😭 Wouldn't most of him just disappear haha, so many fun details in this video!
why is the fnaf community just cracked
If monty was actually lore accurate.
WHY DOES NOBODU GET THE ASTRAL SPIFF/SPEEDRUN INFINITE MONTY GLITCH + CHALLENGE OMFG
WHY WAS MONTY DOING THE TENNA DANCE AND ALSO FILMING A TICKTOCK
Such a fun idea for a song! Who comes up with these?
Where can I download Monty model?
Wait he didnt killed them right ? at the end he was still in the outfit he was at the beginning ?  so it was just a kind of dream ??
THEY’RE STILL DROPPING INSTANT CLASSICS?!?!
Why didn’t Freddy start boxing he has fist🫩
2:07 is this Tenna dance? Near the statue
So can I get another W?
CAN I get a W? You did very well with is song! L bonnie boy
was that a reference to the infinite monty glitch?
Is this a remix of "Alastor's game"?
A NEW LIVING TOMBSTONE SONG RELEASED?!?! AND NOBODY TOLD ME??!?!?
Is it illegal for the living tombstone to make a bad song?
wait why was that so smooth.
2:08 was that a jw fallen kingdom reference?
Bro whos that on the upper left side 1:03????!?!?!?!!?!?!?!??!?!111/1/1/1/1
Am i the only one that noticed that in the scene where there's multiple monties 3 of them are doing dances and its mr antennas dance, macarena, and gangnam style
Am I the only one who actually understood the million-Monty glitch at the end?
Is 2:06 in where you can see all the montys doing things a reference to astral spiffs gigamonty glitch? Cause im sure it has to be
What would be awesome if we get a song for every animatronic from security breach
Wtf were the autistims doing whilst drunking this song??/🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💀💀❌❌❌❌❌❌
Am I the only person who thinks the backing track is really similar to the one in "My Ordinary Life"
Did anybody noticed Monty doing the macarena?😭
wasnt it vanny who possessed monty to destroyed bonnie so she could create burntrap with bis body
Why am I just realizing I haven’t been subbed to y’all I  been listening y’all since fnaf 1 song way back when every project y’all do I listened to
Is that my second animatronic husband on the thumbnail?  Edit: I wish Monty would step on me.
What theory is this whole music based off of??
1:03 Isn't that the mimic in the background?
1:43 why didn’t Freddy square up? He dodged but then let himself get cooked
Why does this sound a little like daisys
I noticed one small issue about the animation Monty has the claw upgrade before killing Bonnie??? 0:47
2:07 is that a Giga Monty I see?
Is it just me or has anyone noticed only foxy got replaced with a wolf and bonnie chica and freddy still in fnaf not replaced
1:04 left side of screen upper corner) is that the mimic or am i actually crazy (still)
How many times have you watched this?  Me: yes
I should ask question. Does this song needs fan animation and remixes? My answer- DEFINITELY NOT! ITS FIRE DAMMIT!
why is the music so quiet 💔
I think we’re getting a mimic2 song cus why is he just following Monty like that
why is this actually good lmao
Why is this animation better than the actual game
1:07 - Monty gets his wrist cuffs from bonnie  1:34 - ditches the pants for patterning on legs like Chica   1:40 - Gets star glasses from Roxy  I dunno what he gets from freddy? If anything? Paint on him i guess??
Why does the song kinda sound like daisy's. The hazbin hotel fan song
Ngl I really wanna know if anyone will make a Glamrock Chica song
Which song is better? This Comes From Inside or Step On Up? Reply to me to choose ur side, TCFI: SOU:
How many likes do you need to make a song about the great Bill Cipher from The Living tombstone ?👻
Is that Montryman? 1:15            (Metroman)
Does nobody know what this song sounds like?
Which one do you think is better is this one or I can't fix you tell me below                                👇
Dude how am I supposed to learn the lyrics with such a beautiful song and animation in the background 😭
1:02 TOP LEFT CORNER is that the mimic?
No one seeing Monty doing the Burger King dances at 2:07 ?
remember when robots moved like humans?
Is this character a girl?
Is this cannon?
how does one achieve the jug band monty model
I don't know if it's implied or not, but I like to think that all the Monty's dancing at the end is a reference to Giga Monty 😙
I can't decide if i love the music or the animation more 😭😭😭
hey did you notice the mimic behind the green screen (2:06)  (LOOK CLOSELY!)
2:08 is that clean bot stretching its head or is that wall-e
Wait its a fnaf song?
2:00 is it just me or does the theme sound like the FNAF 2 song? 🤔
So we going to get a song for each of the Glamrocks? That’s gonna be a wild playlist addition
What’s y’all’s favorite fnaf character or if that’s too hard then what’s your favorite fnaf game
2:07 I love Monty filming a TikTok 😂 And might just be me but what does a “w” mean?
Does anybody also feels like the volume of the song is oddly low? I thought it was a device problem but I tried with another ones and I still hear it unusually low, anyway, great song!
“How many times have you watched this?”       ~ “20712 times”
MONTY CONENT IN 2025!? WE'VE BEEN BLESSED! 🐊🐊🐊
Hey does anyone else see a shadow Bonnie looking thing in the window at the top left of 2:07 ? It’s kinda just looking around and I only see its head , eyes and ears kinda … maybe it’s just me though
NEW TLT SONG AND IT'S ABOUT MONTY?!? 😍😍😍😍
i feel this could be a bit louder?
Is that the Bubba Graham?!
1:04 Did anyone notice the mimic in the top left?
I love it good song tlt can you make more fnaf songs
Yo wait why is the animation actually so peak?? The song is also so silly lmao I love it! ✨
Can we please get a song for each of the other glamrocks?
how tlt keeps making banger Fnaf songs is a mystery
1:47 Why does the part where gator jumps onto freddy and kills him remind me of Murder drones (The Cyn Vs N episode 8)
Who telling Corey about watching this?
Someone explain the lore to me, I didn't understand anything
Is the mimic here, in this song
Can we appreciate how TLT has been making FNAF songs for more than 10 years? without missing a beat!
Why does it sound like the alistor song. To me it does , Still like it tho.
Does anyone notice that at the start of the video, Monty putts a gold ball with Chica’s face on it. And later in the video, he kills Chica with a golf club to the head.
Is this Notice Me Senpai all over again?
Did anyone notice that at the end of the song? There's the secret of the mimic hippo at the end.
Now who wants to listen to the mimic song !!??
Why did they make Bonnie with a small nose and without his eyeliner??🕊️🕊️🕊️ It looks bad😭💔
Where is the FNAF fans??👇👇👇                                                    ❤
Is this hurt the broom?
why did monty do that? is he stupid?
1:02 when Monty is dragging Bonnie, did anyone else notice the mimic on the left?
2:07 Is that Tenna's Dnace?
where's the fnaf 6 song???
2:07 Why does nobody notice the mimic hiding behind the green screen where Monty was taking a photo? Am i the only one??   Also, i found Monty doing the macarena, it's silly tbh  Edit: I just realized that Monty infront of the green screen was actually referencing the burger king 'join us for a bite' meme
What's wrong with the Living Tombstone? It seems they're being prevented from making bad songs.
Who is feat?
IS FNAF BACK?!!
It’s great but why are your songs only like 2 minutes long nowadays? They don’t last nearly long enough. You need to add a bridge or something before the final chorus. 😢
…months intrusive thoughts?
Why did you just recreate Alastor's game ?
Was that a die in a fire shot with Monty destroying Freddy?
Can you make a song for the other characters like Freddy chica Roxy and Bonnie?
Idk anything about this game, does this happen or not?
"Man this song's great! And the animation's so cool-" 2:06 "IS HE MAKING A TIKTOK-  *IS THAT THE JOIN US FOR A BITE DANCE???????"*
1:03 anyone else saw the mimic in the window?
@TheLivingTombstone  ¿Can i make you a cuestion?
Why does the beat sound like dasies beat
Is that the Mimic in the top left at 1:03
Can we all agree that when we saw multiple montys it was a reference to that one glitch?
1:03 who else saw the Mimic in the back?!
Why I must use VPN to watch this?
why is the mimic in the corner 1:02
Does this confirm he killed Bonnie?
😭 good song just but why though....
Is this the giga monty takeover?
Where sun and moon?
Wait the animation is so fire dude like

Wait I smell something..  is that the living tombstone cooking again? 🔥
Why is it so shoooooort
Why did the mimic make Monty a murderer? Is he stupid?
Why does he look like that
why does it sound like ai jschlatt in the beginning
Monty song, wait, what the 67?
Wait a sec- IS THIS CANON?!
glamrock freddy would fight back i think?
lowkey enjoyed that animation so much and don't know why
1:03 do you guys see the mimic in the back
Can you do a song on Secret of the Mimic next?
Why the hell is clean o vac at 2:08
Wasn't Monty innocent? Didn't many youtubers prove he didn't kill Bonnie? And In a roller Coaster, it shows Bonnie handing Monty the Guitar.
Fried rice at eddys new song release?
Ey you must make an song to secret of the mimic too or mabye an poppy playtime chapter 1 song too? But this song is so freaking good bro keep it up man :)
Am I the only one who thought this one was bad?
Is giga monty living tombstone - fnaf sb lore now? 😂
I-Is this a new F-FNAF song from TLT?!!!
The music and animation is kinda fire. Yk?
Is there legit anything else Fnaf related that needs a song..?   (edit: I just realized sotm exists)
what is this
2:06 alguien más ve a Monty haciendo el trend del chico de BurgerKing? XD / Anyone see Monty doing the trend of the BurgerKing guy? XD
Has anyone noticed its sounds like the song daisies by Black Gryph0n in the beginning
What are they feeding these animatrors bruh.Amazing animation and story telling bro.😭❤
Is Monty possessed by Gregory in this clip?
Why is Living Tombstone ALWAYS making bangers dude?
actually goes crazy what the fuck
This guy still posts?
Do you think I could use this for a video ?
WHERE IS THE PIZZERIA SIMULATOR MUSIC VIDEO?! 😭💀
The poor guy was done so dirty in the games. Monty... redemption arc?
Is this just a modern die in a fire
giga monty? Is that you?
Wait the fazbear company has so much money so why don’t they just make another glamrock Bonnie instead of using Monty?
Monty if Gregory possessed him: the song (really good song though I LOVE this so much ❤)
What genre of music is this?
Of all characters why monty?
Why does the music sounds so whimsical while Monty kills everyone 😭🙏🥀💔
THEY MADE ANOTHER ONE?!! also, this is the first TLT FNAF song that is only about one specific character, which is cool!
Is that a gigamonty reference?
Who thinks we should have a Monty spin-off game that explains his origins?
1:04 is that the fucking MIMIC in the top right
I have one question, so now will you do a song for every glamrock??
1:02 Wtf is that thing in the window
When secret of Mimic song???
New living tombstone fnaf music in the big 25?!
Is it possible to be in love with a tune??
Why does he sound like Caseoh
1:49-1:54 And how will Gregory know that his new and future dad Glamrock Freddy was murdered by Monty at the Mega Pizzaplex? 🥺😭
Is this tuff?
Another one already?!
A TLT tombstone fnaf song? in this economy?
Why is volume so low for this one 😢😢😢
3 hours ago?
A song about Monty in 2025? YES PLEASE 🤑👌
02:07 is that a reference to that 100 Monty glitch!?!
Is the living tombstone coming back 🥹
Wondered what those videos were about.
YO THIS JUST DROPPED AND WE DIDNT HEAR ANYTHING BEFOREHND? PEAK??
Where is Edwin
what is this referring to? other than the game heavily implying monty brought bonnie out of commission, is the rest of his “murder spree” a reference to anything or just fun?
Why is the song so quiet
Ok if monty did attack bonnie , how is that even possible. Was he corrupted or something.
What about secret of the mimic
I wonder what security breach would be like if bonnie fr showed up.
So weird this is the first fnaf living tombstone song focused on a specific character I wonder if this will open the doors for other characters???
Why does this gives me The Alastor Game Song vibe?
2:07 is that giga monty?
can you do FNAF into the pit song or secret of the mimic pls?
1:02 IS THAT THE FUCKING MIMIC AT THE SALE?!!
Why do I feel like you do know about something that no body's Else know 😮
Why is every fnaf song yall make peak!?!?!
Why is the video blocked in Russia?😢
Was the last lyric about the Thank you and goodnight, Hazbin hotel song?
Masterful music video!😎👍How did Ara Adkins contribute by “Mastering” in this video? I do not know what you mean by it.
Wth was that?
Why does this feel like this music ain’t close to fnaf music in general?
IS THAT THE MIMIC BEHIND THE GREEN SCREEN AT 2:07???
2:07 Giga Monty mentioned??? 😭😭
Erm what
Idk, silly monty 🐊🎸
Why this masterpiece of Living Tombstone wasnt in my recommendation page 😭🙏 thats new peak fnaf animation with MONTY!?
whys it so quiet
2:07 is this a giga Monty reference?
Monty getting a TLT original before Bonnie? I think Bonnie fans took a fat L today.
Is it the hit that will rule my fy?
2:06 I can spot the Mixamo dance, gangnam style, the Join Us for a Bite meme dance, the macarena, YMCA and maybe the Carson Shearer dance?
Sun and moon song when??😅 I guess I can keep dreaming...

🐲ROCK AND ROLLL?!??!?!!🐊 AHEHAHEHA HA!?!!!!☕️🦆👌          🐰💜 0_0 OHOOOMGAH
Why are the views at 6k, but the likes are at 19k?
Does this count as a theory video
OMG what this is, you caught me, it's too much music
Is the beast song of wordl
Yo Monty can you save us from Citra's creation?
and were is the die în fire reference?
I can tell if 2:07 is a reference to that one glitch where unlimited Monty's spawn in, if it is thats so funny, and there also so much random references in that scene alone like one of them doing the burger king sister location guy doing a tiktok, and one doing the macarena.
(1:04) IS THAT THE FRICKIN' MIMIC?!
So.......more Monty songs?
5k Views? is this is a joke?
Did anyone realize that Monty in Secret of the Mimic was supposed to be used in Fredbears, and then Bonnie replaced him with Freddy Fazbear and the Gang, and then now Monty destroys Bonnie as revenge? I think that's a pretty cool parallel.
This is such great work, I need to know who sung this and who animated this 🎉🎉🎉
why does this lowkey sound like discord?
WHAT! is this cannon?
2:07 IS THIS A REFERENCE TO GIGA MONTY???? 😭😭😭😭
Is this a gigamonty reference?
a fnaf song in… 2025?😨
2:07 Is that a giga Monty reference? lmao
Someone knows who made the glamrock bonnie poster???
The animation is so good wtf Also why does the idea of Monty destroying the Pizzaplex out of rage make a better plotline than the one we actually got in ruin-
I wonder if we’re get a secret of the mimic song❤❤ but I still love this childhood hero’s fnaf songs ❤❤
Why is fnaf security breach popular now in 2025???
A new FNAF song?🤑🤑
Could a soul reverse time, through a physical manifestation of it’s own regret?
WAIT WHY IS THIS ACTUALLY GOOD also 2:07 is an amazing refrence
After seeing Monty destroying his friends....I wonder who deserves hate... Gregory or Monty?
I wonder if tlt remake f1 the movie theme from hans zimmer?
How long have you listened to this song Multiple times
Is the volume of this song a lot lower than other Tombstone songs, or is it just me?
why did monty kill everyone (in his mind atleast), is he evil?
SILKSONG AND A NEW TLT FNAF SONG ? ARE WE IN HEAVEN ?
What?...
Anyone remember Giga Monty?
Wait, these guys still make Nerdcore songs? It's been 2 years (not counting the join us for a bite remix)
Is this about giga monty
Why i think this is a new popular fnaf song?
Really shows the spotlight, Murray always wanted....eh?
What the animation !
Is it just me or...is this kinda buns lol
When do you plan to make a digital circus song? Are you going to wait until the series is over?
So.. in the end, the theory that says Monty killed Bonnie to be with Freddy wasn't canon?
Very nice song!! Has it been 11 years? 😨
Did I just experience peak so early?
Very random
I wonder if the part of him killing Bonnie will be Canon
Was it only like 30sec?
How many years ago were we rocking along to the first song you made about FNAF!? It's been a hot minute, but you've united us again
Did they present this song on the world tour?
