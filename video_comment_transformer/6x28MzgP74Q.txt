Bro why Zara is not telling andaleeb about his past problem about what was the reason of DNA 🫤😤🫠
Why the hell is her parents not telling the Truth about numair becuas she still doesn't know
Dr.Numair is just relying on old report,why is he not getting his new test done,
Wasn’t Zara a specialist already lol

Atleast give little update about moiz?
Hasn't Zara already done specialization? She's a gynecologist
Where is that scene where Hassan commits suicide from the roof top?? Mawra and Usman Mukhtar are looking so good together.
Vote if u lyk anadil's cute gestures while his father is taking to her
Dr sameer is the guy Aaima bag was engaged to? I think, what's his name?
Itna bakwas q kr gye hen ye drama ?  Andaleeb ki over acting 🤔🤔
Does andaleeb know why he did the DNA ?
is this episode missing scenes? I don't remember seeing Andaleeb and Anadil reunite , same for Andaleeb and Nomair ???? Thank god Zara left this stupidity jungle , but when and why she thought of studying overseas????  Sad this drama had  such a beautiful start and topic but now it's just dragging , just like some of other Hum dramas .please finish it !
Andaleeb can’t forgive him for one mistake and the countless mistakes she made starting from day 1 of their marriage go unnoticed??? She is such a toxic character
How could andaleeb not go and meet her daughter as soon as she returned
What is happening? Wasn’t this drama addressing domestic violence. But now it is an Indian soapbox without any sense. Andaleeb forgot all those stupidity that numair had to put up with her. Not once she went to see her daughter. Waoo what a stand
Why are the characters always schizophrenic, over night personality changes
when does dr numair find out that andaleep is still alive ???
Tell me how is the drama, I liked it very much
Whts wrong with this carecter Andaleeb...real example of selfish women a bad mother also a bad daughter
When end this drama??🙂
How could she be pregnant
How many episodes are remain ?
Please make the drama's based on logic this is such a  melodrama where is her self respect when she eloped
Suddenly a beautiful Drama turn into disaster why ?  Now rushing for packup
Why andaleebs mother didn't tell that numair cannot be a father?
why deebu is overacting
Soooo nonsense drama , what is the meaning of this drama pure joke 💩🤡!!!!!! FULL WASTAGE OF TIME
Is drama ka season 2 chaye pls ❤
Is drama ka season 2 chaye pls ❤
Deebu not once thinking abt her daughter is beyond me now. I get it as a new mom she may not have any motherly feeling towards her daughter the baby deserves a little thought.
How numair came to know that andaleeb is alive??
Hain… ? Has the director lost some pages of the script? When and how does Umair find out she is not dead but Alive - the scene of Zara finding out Andaleeb is alive was a given 10 minutes, but the husband wanted to wrap up the drama and go home quickly!!😮
When did the the husband nimaor and SaaS find out that deebu is alive? I can't fins that part
why this drama still continue 😅😅
Who is writer of this drama
Why Andaleeb's parents aren't telling her the damn truth ????!!!!!????????!!!!
She is not thinking about her daughter. How come? This is so strange not even she wants to hold her. Where are her motherly instincts.
What the hell is this? Has anyone from the team even watched this before uploading it? Like literally what the helllllllll is this?
Wasn't she already specialized in gyane??  And USMLE dia nhi aur USA ja rhi specialization Keliye 😂😂
Wait Numair is wearing Extension?????????????????????????????????????
Why is Andaleeb being so cruel?? Plz Andaleeb have some heart Andaleeb!!!!
Why is Numair beating about the bush? And not coming to the point
Now suddenly she wants the daughter, pehle kyun chor ke gayee use.. What story has the writer written 😂😂😂. Pagal writer
what is the written trying to write?????
Their is no purpose of this drama
When is this drama ending, it's getting PATHETIC..
Is the new doctor...the ex fiance of Aima Baig?
What kind of mother is Andaleeb,?  She didn’t yet met her child, it’s been two or three days she came back
Also why didnt andaleebs parents tell her about infertility part.. and most important why dr numair n oarents didnt further discuss how andaleeb got pregnant…  Intehaee fazool!
I don't know what the writer is trying to convey to us ??
How come no one is holding Andalib accountable for faking her death???? That's not only illegal but immoral and psychotic! This drama turned into absolute nonsense!
Am I the only one who wants to know what happened to Hasan..is he cured or not.? It feels like they should have shown some proper ending to his story..
Numair ny itna supports kiya But andleeb forget everything why?why?😢
What is this bro 🙄what is deebu doing that's totally non sense
How to get a job in US after doing specialisation in gynae from Pakistan. Dr Zara can u help other Pakistani gynaecologists regarding this? 😂
How doctor zara was going to airport alone without any family member?? 😂 No one was actually going to drop her to airport.. strange 😂
Is it me or anyone else also finds Numair’s walk funny😜
Why numair most of the time wears skinny jeans
But wen did numair knew tat deepu was alive ? Tat shown in any episode ? I dont remember
Andleeb have to decide if she has son or daughter.
How can they skip the part when numair get to know that Andaleeb is alive?? Why it is so normal for all of themm
If he is infertile how he became a father
How come no one is calling out Numair for not telling that he could not have children, and potentially spoiling the life of another girl.
