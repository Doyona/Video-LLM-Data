Wait if other cameramen where watching plunger mans pov doesent that mean those few cameramen know what secret agent told plunger man before he died? This means the other cameramen there might tell the titans what’s gonna happen so they can prepare ahead of time.
I want to know if Blue Suit Camera Man survives.

The last scene is a great moment of respect, but also raises a question. If everyone was following Plunger Cameraman's display the whole time, does it mean that the Secret Agent inadvertently revealed himself to more people than he thought ? If so, it would be a hilarious mistake on his part, thinking that Plunger Cameraman kept any secret from his people.

Why is the Titan TV Man screen damaged on one side?
The end is a mystery, plunger might might have a chance to survive because they were repairing cameramen, the same possibility could be said for dark speakerman.
lol I was watching and I was like oooo maybe secret scene I guessed correctly I guess?
does it mean were getting a new character because of "bigger threat"?
Who loves iskibid toilet???
Because it was so crazy it looked like they defeated the boss, but what about G-man? Is he still coming back? We will see in the next episode or episode 80 if there is

I'm so lost. Why is there an actual human in this sreis now?
I wonder that what about large camera man
Wait, so that means in the future the cameraman side loses or will there be more agents? Wait again large dark cameraman that means there has to be a plunger speaker man like if you think this will actually happen The secret agent was saying stuff before plunger cameraman was in his office
Who is hyped for episode 71? 👇
Astro toxic?

13:27 is that brown cameraman?
Wheres is brown câmera man?
Wait Is Plunger Cameraman still alive
That new last scene just blew what could happen wide open.  Were we watching plungerman's POV live through another recently revived cameraman?  Or were we watching a recording from plungerman through his own POV?  And who else has been revived we don't know about?  That was just the cameraman's base, not the speakerman's.  Big speakerman, maybe?
why there was plunger cameraman shadow
Mr dafuqboom I have a question maybe you won't answer but I still want to ask I wanted to know if the brow cameramen or also called simp cameramen was alive and could he be a villain in the future

Will Astro toilet 71 be next?
Were is the real G Man?
Who was the cameraman wearing a hat at the end?🤔🤔
If that is exactly how it is showed, does that mean that they saw the secret agent? I mean, another camera's pov and many other probably/defenitly saw the secret in the pov. And don't say transition  error, cuz the tv would be black with the message instead of directly showing the secret agent.
I don’t understand this part why where dig doing the thumbs up? 13:22
Is there only 1 extra scene
Is this the end? NOOO  WE NEED THE GOOD ENDING 😭 im gonna miss plungerman:( salute!

13:22 thanks dafuqboom for the new scenes  But I still have a question what happened to the TV of the left of El Titan TV?
0:35 is this just surface tension
Hey is the finals ending skibidi toilet?
Bro does that mean we were not in plunger camera man’s pov?
Why titan tv man has one of his tv's broken???
Doesn't that mean that since they were looking at his pov, they also saw secret agent
I wonder if every one was watching the tv saw the secret agent 🤔
Why titan tv screen was broken?
wait the ending scene… does that mean the cameramen know the existence of secret agent? because it was all displayed on screen…
Is he going to quit
Is it the end
So why one of the tv is broken on titan tv mam

I wonder if a get a pov as a toilet
g man is not dead right guys?
Why didn't titan camera man give a thumbs up? 😢
Yo i didn't know that the large tv man can just do that and why speakers instead of tv's?
My only question about this is, at the end of the video there is the camera man who has brown or black suit with a hat is he an important character or is he the simp cameraman in a new look?
how did titan tvman broke his left tvman arm?
What if the scientists body is actually a robot and the entire time the scientist was actually a parasite toilet

what 🤨
Who the hell watches shit like this?
How come the titan tv man has a broken screen
i'm a little lost on this one..... did the camera guys just betray the boom box/audio guys?
I love the extra scenes but is plunger dead or still alive?
The shadows at 13:21 don't make sense, who is the middle shadow. The far right shadow is the pov camera man (proof at  13:29 ). So I'm thinking it might be one of those invisible cameramen but it might also just be a rendering issue and I'm looking too far into it.
I wonder how the titan cameraman evolve to
what happened to titan tv man in 70 part 3
Wait 😮 did every cameraman that got injured got repaired pcm and dsm
Did titan cameraman has two arms?
Are they the dead agents
at the end why is upgrade titan tv man one of his screens are broken

Why didn't you reveal to us the reason for the broken Titan TV Man screen? ‏‪10:56‬‏
How does he have the attention spand to do these animations 😮
one episode can be 13 mins? dang, that’s rly long
hey my humble dafuqboom, have you ever thought about upgrading the titan speakerman? and place interactions with other announcers like a female announcer? I would find it interesting to see that the titan speakerman also cares about the speakerman just as the titan camera man cared about the pluger, it would be interesting to see their interests, and of course also an evolution and upgrade in the titan speakerman, I think some would like that, I really appreciate your work with affection S2
13:28 IS THAT BROWN CAMERAMA?
13:29 New cameraman?
Guys did yall notice the Brown cameraman with the hat in the new scene he is behaind the window
but how come it's just full of explosion sounds?
what is going on
Is this the end?
Is that just the addition of the scene? What about the TV on the left of the Titan TVman?
how titan tv mans side tv screen broke is still unanswered
The best episodes all together but I'm still wondering how did Titan TV man got one of his TVs broken 🤔
So what happened to TItan Tv man’s shoulder tv, its cracked
If they have seen from the perspective of the plunger, could it be that the others have seen the secret agent?  ￼
The question still remains why the titan tvman broke the upper screen.
Way the titan tv man are injured to the righy tv?
Dafuqbom how did the Titan TV man break Umbro's TV?
New camera ?  13:28
Can everyone report that one bot who is spamming in the reply section in almost EVERY comment?
Is this the end of the series dafuqboom or what
why at the end it has the cameraman thumbs up that's just messed up.
But how did titan tv man have a damaged screen
Is this the end of skibidi toilet because if it is I will cry😭
a question when the series will end
Hey boom do you know the amazing digital circus or murder drones?!
13mins? 13MINS? no wonder why this so long for this episode to come out!
And the Dark Speakerman and Plunger Cameraman? He's Come back in episode 71 or 72? Please say yes🥺
Secret scene of this video Makes me wonder if the electronics guys at the lab are aware of this or not?😅
Wait a minut did dafuq boom stole  Brown camera mans clothes i just saw that in the Title i saw dafuq whering yellow blue stripes and brown coat did brown camera man got replaced by  Dafuq???
What? No new escene?
Is this the end?...
we still dont know how titan tv man broke his left tv
This is end?
Is there some plushies?
One episode left Till the finale?
The sad deaths of Plunger Man and Black Speaker Man...😢 But the other cameramen gave a thumbs up, so why didn't only the cameraman wearing the hat give a thumbs up?
i have one quest, how the right tv of tvman broke?
So this is the end?
Everyone giving thumbs up to the tv screen at the end is so sad, it reminds me of episode 50. Doesn’t this mean if the cameramen were watching plunger’s screen, then they would see the secret agent as well?
