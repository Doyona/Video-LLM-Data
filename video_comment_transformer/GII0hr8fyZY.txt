This is not ilegal?
Its not a handball...?
Where is Cherchesov???
Wow... Is that a penalty? I haven't seen that kind of situation in a long time, I don't remember exactly. But perhaps it wasn't considered an intentional retreat, the defender was pressed by the opponent and it wasn't him who lifted the ball. I don't remember if it's just when he lifts the ball himself, he can't head it back and the goalkeeper catches it. 🤔🤨
Indirect
Surely that’s a backpass  Even though the last pass was a header the others weren’t so it’s a backpass
Feels like they're trying to circumnavigate the rule which isn't allowed but what ref is gonna call it
Isn't that illegal?
Is it okay to catch a ball from teamate?
