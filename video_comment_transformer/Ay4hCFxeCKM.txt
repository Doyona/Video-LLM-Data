3:17  What does "fallback reward" mean? How can it be a "reward" that you do NOT get puzzle pieces?   My wife has all the animals, so what happens to the "gray puzzle pieces"??   Will she get them later when new animals arrive?  Do they disappear?

How do you clame the deco with the qr code?
Love, love, love the game. You do a great job. I do have one question, tho. Why does Tom need to run off after you tell him what you want. Couldn’t we tell him what we want AND how many at the same time? Seems like it would be more efficient. Just a suggestion. 😀🩷

How to get decoration through the barcode
Pls give us like a lasso tool for edit mode so we can lasso areas and then move the entire decoration setup inside at once so you dont need to move every single item when you just want it in a different place
No spooky Halloween music this year?? 😢
Fences- when we get a new fence piece it’s usually just one piece!  Why can’t you open it up in the store , once we get that one piece, so we can buy more pieces with our coins -not diamonds- so we can add onto our new fence?   And we can’t connect different one fence pieces, that wouldn’t look nice even if that feature worked.   I have so many just one piece, same with path pieces, just one.
Did any of you see and get on the catalog  the first decoration they showed in the video for the week 1 ? I did not find it yet

What’s going on with the Halloween event? Today is the last day, the game is not letting me finish the event.  The game shortened me with task to finish.  This is sucks!  This is the second time it happened. Why? You wasted my time.
Who has all the sanctuary animal puzzle pieces?? That’s impressive 😅
I wanted to buy more snails with gold shield. But now their gone - is this all just a scam? Thing we could buy before are now unable to get! 🤯🤦🏼‍♂️

Why isn’t the potion stand with the bats flying around it not on the first week of the catalog? You said “in the first week of the catalog will feature classic Halloween decorations that we may have missed”  while showing that decor. So I was thinking it would of been there this week

What does it mean when you collect chickens on the road?

I can't see my list friends when I enter the game, my game crashes, I close and open it, it takes a long time, what should I do? thanks
Were can we find the qr code to complete our collection?
How about let decide the player where to put the puzzle piece when they get it?  It is do frustrating to have animals missing just 1 or 2 and have a bunch of others just started.  Also let's do something with the voucher. Can we trade them in for actual useful goods? I've at least more than 1000 green ones and don't really know what to do with them. They are such a waste
Who else has noticed that when you are almost to building up your barn or silo and you only need like say a plank but you don't get it and go to your farm the next day and get that last plank so you go to build your barn up and lo and behold somehow you're now missing 3 planks ? How about when you're almost done with a special catalog task? Only need one loaf of bread out of 8 and it's almost finished, when it's done you collect it yet your count remains at 7? I'm having these issues and I'm sure others have too. Yet you go to let them know and they want screenshots for proof? How many farmers here are taking a screenshot of every single thing they do on their farm? I'm only trying to let them know they have a glitch. What's going to happen when you're sending your hard earned money for extras and this glitch screws you out of your purchase? If you don't have a screenshot you have no proof so you can go get bent I guess.
How & where to scan the code
Why when your time runs out on a task, the system says you failed two of the same thing? Might wanna look at your code.

I've completed some tasks from the halloween event but even after claiming it I didn't get the halloween hat. This happened to me twice today.

How to get the deco from the scan image?
how come the autumn collection ended but i didn't see some of the items like fences, wooden animals, etc being advertised
Why so many decoration but i dont have many place to decor..nite mode plis😊
What about more feed production?  What is the point of more sanctuary animals if you can’t feed them?  Why does sanctuary feed take so long to produce?  AND why double experience points as a bonus for selling to farm visitors when you don’t give experience points (only cash) for those actions?  Either add exp points or do away with a stupid reward.
Can you give us timeline of full month like coc, like 1-11 cwl, 1-10 challenge 1, 11-20  challenge 2, etc. They always give us in advance
How about letting us buy these decorations with in game money instead of real money or gems which are purchased oooh look!!! WITH REAL MONEY!!!!
Can I join the group of people that pre test the game before release
new birds like the parrot, the pheasant,... the rooster (there are hens, there are chicks but where's the rooster?).
Can you make the production machines more affordable please? They are very expensive! The farm pass pushes you to other levels, which is awsome, but the machines take up all your coins and diamonds, as well as the land decorations you can taylor. To upgrade those are expensive even with vouchers and blueprints. I've been playing for years. I love Hayday
How about some little bridges that connect with the canals? And gates for the fences? Thank you.
Full time employee here, is it possible to complete all the orders? 😢 I don't wanna miss any decorations

My hay day is not connecting for last months   I don't know why😢 please someone tell me why was it's happening 😢😢😢😢
The new collections are kind of fun but I don’t want to have to pay real money to complete them!! It would be great to have some new buildings and helpers instead of just new decorations as well. And could we PLEASE finish one sanctuary animal at a time with the puzzle pieces?!?!
Why is the game buffering between different areas
Why I cant not Watch promotional videos to save time on products? Help me do that
How do we claim the gift

More sanctuary animals!? Stop adding! Its hard just to complete one animal because your game doesn't work on one!
Can we have more Halloween fences please?? The old ones I mean!
How can I claim the gift? I'm on a tablet

Is there a link for this
SANCTUARY: please. Can there only be a limited number of puzzles/animals in progress at any one time? I have 3  puzzles (1 only needs 1 more piece) almost completed and instead of completing them new puzzles are started which means I have 7+ puzzles in progress. It gets frustrating.
Can you guys please update the items to be more common for upgrading the land and make elderly helpers more useful
Cool decor! So fun! Can we get a CLOSED mode to avoid visitors stopping by the farm so often? or maybe some new characters?
Where is the free deco???? YOU FORGOT!
How to use the qr code?
Can we have new production building? Been a year or more since a new one
Can you please make the animals storage available? Sometimes I’m fed up of them and I want to get rid of them, and I cant.
Can somebody tell me what is the use of the all animal in the farm? The birds, and the dogs, and the cats, etc? Except that they give xp? What’s their other use, other than taking space from the farm? Like I really want to know.
Are we going to get the planter box that was supposed to come with the summer edition of dairy news before you all took a vacation because it prevented us getting the decoration addition for that set.
A town building laundry mat ...just ask for anything clothing related
Where is the yard sale?
Sounds 👻SPOOKTACULAR👻....   Will there be items we can buy using VOUCHERS , COINS also?
Can you make getting land easier all these decorations and nowhere to put them, getting land is too hard… or allow to buy land , thanks!
Do you guys ever do anything original? I'm convinced all people at hay day could be replaced with robots and nobody would notice.  Same events, same concept of production buildings, same seasonal themes, same-looking decorations
How do I collect new decoration?
Hows about SuperCell start listening to the requests for Hay Day instead of just the requests for Squad Busters. That game has recieved all the improvements people requested. Plus already got a collab. They just leave Hay Day in the dust , or have bad developers working on it apparently.
great to see many asking for night mode maybe we'll see it actually happen one day!
Can someone share the link for the deco?
How about more space for the zoo area.
Does anyone know the name of the Hay Day email?
Hey guys could anyone explain to me how to get the task event decorations? I'm a bit confused, just redownloaded the game so i missed out on updates :)
Hiw can i get that QR code please??
Where is the flow code?
How do we claim the QR
How can i delete and get rid of some items that are in my storage? I dont have any use for all the things in there and would rather get rid of them or sell them if thats possible.
Please don’t tell me those Mag decorations are gonna be 500k coins
What about free coins buildings to expensive each time we need to sell everything so we can buy a new machine imagine only the ice cream machine was 31000 coins
How about a day/night mode? Or some actual weather conditions? Snow is the only one we get.  How about an update to the town? We’ve never had one. It’s getting boring there. And the fishing area could use a little change as well. Other than that….i still LOVE my Hay Day🐓
Will we ever get a paint brush for planting bushes, like we can use in edit mode?
When will the update be please?
Per favore, taducete in ITALIANO? GRAZIE ❤
What do you think about opening more blueberry and avocado plants? Pleaseeeee
Nice, but when are we getting new decorations from Ads? We still have summer ones
3:48 how to get that church images pls explain.
Why is the game majorly focused on decorations? It's always about 99% decorations and barely 1% about farming.
CAN WE PLEASE GET A PC VERSION THROUGH LIKE GOOGLE PLAY BETA LIKE CLASH ROYALE AND CLANS
I have a question if I buy the following farm pass(59.99 ) will I have it the next time another one appears? or will I have to buy it again next time?
The easy paint brush system sounds brilliant I like to change up large areas for different calendar events and it takes so long.  Can you please make existing decorations more accessible like paving and fencing, you need a lot of these not just 2 or 3 given at random. ive been playing for years and still can't implement ideas as there is no option to purchase them (real or game cash) I'm patient but even I give up after a year of waiting for items to possibly become available... Would love some black or very dark paving, I only see brown wooden Thanks for all your efforts! Love 💕, love 💗, love 💕
it would be perfect if we could store the animals we no longer need! can you pls add more baby animals and more types of flowers  for the bees so we can choose which kind of flowers we want to use
Will we get a chance to get the dancing sheep again?
Can we get a meaningful content update for once instead of MORE DECOS?? PLS?!!!?
can you make it so we can play it on pc...my device doesnt let me play this game on mobile....thanks
