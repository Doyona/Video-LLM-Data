Couldn’t you guys take the engine apart and build it?
The look in Mikes eye when Sean questions the n54 fitment
16:42 Did you look that all up on Engine Patrol?
How old is the fuel in it?
Where did the new camera guy go?
How many mistakes you make from beginning that is not truth... 😮😮😮😮 Mike are you ok??
F12 companion ? Strip it and build it like the f12
Strip the interior and engine and build a crazy full electric single speed torque monster time attack car or just get it fully converted to the GT3X race car but hoonigan style big exposed twin turbos
You can still save it, right?
What in the fuck is that tow guy doing
Call Rob Dahm and ask him to build you a 3 or 4 rotor engine
Uhh, I have to assume that the trans is already fucked? Cause ya know, put it in neutral and PUSH it off? If it was in park that whole time and the flatbed driver knew that, then he needs to pay damages if there are any.
What I want to know is how does one destroy a GT at 22k miles 🤯
wonder where all that water in the h1 starter came from lol
So, Mike, Who is “JASON SHAREK”? 😂
Mikes opinion on n54’s??? 😆😆 I wanna see him build one !
The mercs what u do when u want to put that manual fob in, the cap of the start button take that off and you can start the car with the manual fob 😊
Where did you find that tow truck driver?
Day #3 of asking Dave and Damon to get my Mike a Gt3rs
What about a hellcat motar
did they check the pyro fuse if its been in a crash that seems to go first when an airbag goes off
What happened to Yuvy
Why didn’t y’all put the go jacks on it to take it off the tow truck??
AMG GT3 / Drift project in the near future???  🙉🙈🙊
Not sure if this has been thought about what about a track day have fans pay a certain amount of money to get to ride with Mike on a track day
Wait, dealership to track, 90mph off, hit radiator, no water, thrown rod, 10inch kerb, rats....
WTF unloading job is that?  He might as well just got in the tow truck and floored it to dump that GT on the ground
Is there a fuel shut off switch in it? If he hit a curb, couldn’t that have been tripped?
What about a z4 tranny? Also, what would be cool is if you guys rebuilt it and gifted it to one of your young aspiring mechanics. That would be cool to see.
Have you Two ever thought to make beanies to match the hoodies?
That’s a Mercedes GTR right? Or is it SLR? Just guessing based on the blacked out thumbnail
Where the hell are his skids BMW and Mercedes are bad to get into neutral that's why there's plastic skids even a mc Donald's tray would work and if we're talking bad tesla the worst thing in the world 😅
Hey Shawn you still got them jugs of coolant? Mike might need a few 😂
Marc please stop talking. Stay behind the camera, shutup & do your job (you quite literally ruin the element) 😅 Also is anyone else wondering what happened to fourth wall?
See if you can put a S63 or a CLS63 OR maybe try to go nuts and put a GLE OR GLC AMG in there I think you'd have a better chance fitting a GLC 63 motor in there I think the GLE is a bigger motor
I wonder if mike likes drifting or racing more idk why but i just think about it here and there
New Shop Car?
Did anyone else notice all the white substance on the hoses? Typical of phosphorus from coolant. I bet it overheated!
Bad heat exchanger?
idk if its possible but u guys should put the v10 motor from e60 in the Mercedes
What happened to the camera guy for the stories channel?
Isn't that the same V8 twin turbo that's in Dave's Bentley!????
Is it possible to swap with 5.0 coyote engine on it
Ok why these cringey thumbnails tho
Mike's own DDE stories channel project car??????
What causes camshaft to break in 2?
Idk if Cadillac had any recalls like that
How can you tell if a cars in neutral if the truck didnt stop
They fired the new guy who was doing the stories filming? Good idea to keep costs low but sad too!🫡🫡🫡🫡
do like the youtuber josh lerant has a motor he is doing a hemi swap inn his
There has to be a way to put that car in neutral manually🤦🏼‍♂️
def see if damon and dave want to it fix and prolly sell? lil investment??
Idk about you guys bout I’m the dude to ask the tow truck driver if he needs me to show him how to do his job. 🤦🏼‍♂️like bruh
Yo Mike, Toyota were leaning engines back in the 80’s, when did BMW start?  (Check Tim’s car’s 3S-GTE). 😊
Why not put a M156 engine in there. Would be tasteful as it remains an AMG and takes the NA 6.2l V8. Would be sikkkk
ask Alex from @legitstreetcars :)
This smells fishy...Maybe another one of Daves skits?
So because it needs a new engine how about a built C63 AMG block and if your already building it get a custom transmission to get it hybrid for some insane torque
ask dave, he wants a drift Merc.... with cherry interior
OR you get the m159 NA engine for it. should work with the same transmission? gt3 body kit. could also just replace the engine and tune it for like 800-900.
Wtf is that tow truck operator doing ? Yea garentie he's done that before
I thought these were closed deck design?
pull the engine out dismantle it and you will see if you can rebuild it or if you really need a new engine.
Quick question, I work near an airport so I hear military jets and private jets all the time at work and that's normally when I watch your videos is on my lunch break. Are you guys closer to an airport in the newer HQ or am I hearing Jets overhead here the last few videos I hear a jet every once in a while when you're at the garage and I look around where I'm at and I don't see a single plane in the sky. Am I going crazy or are you guys closer to an airport
Wait I know a guy that does this as a job....... MATT ARMSTRONG?????
Just drag it off with the forklift, wtf is that driver doing?
100 grand to fix it? they literally cost less then 100k used , wtf😂
Day 7 of asking the boys to bring back the JDM Space
And how many recalls on the 4.7 aka jz
Was that 3rd gen
Why did the plastic panels stop? I had one friend say they are necessary for air flow and sound! I think its all a gimmick 😊
a little skid plate under the tires? splash of soap? Mickey then it didn't start or didn't start then Mickey? NO unwanted guests chewed wire test!
Could be the spark plugs and starter
If Mike needs a transaxle, don't they still have the F12 one. When they are going after crazy.
put a twinturbo s600 v12 engine?
check the ignition wire the mouse probably chewed through it.
What’s the dealio martilio boy Josh Laurent is putting a hellcat engine in his.
AMG with 22K miles, seems like the original owner should have had a warranty, no?
I was wondering what was hiding under the tarp near the F12 in some of the other videos this week.... I think I can stop wondering now 🤣
Just call the dealer ask what was wrong they will have history and technician notes
I watched this old timer take repell bug spray put it on the lights wait then wipe off and looked cleaner then new try the taillights what would it hurt?
Thinking if it has an air to water intercooler, if it’s failed internally would cause that mixture and possible hydro lock
Pretty sure the air bag is a takata air bag? Because the air bag problem was one that effected many manufacturers, from hyundai to mercedez.
is that the same engine as in the Bentley?
Where is Mikes first supercar?????  He said a client asked him to look at this Mercedes for him.  And thats not a super car anyway.  I really hate how this channel always trys to click bait people.   Hope Dave the swindler isn't up to his old tricks again.
The car is meh. Its the vermin that has chewed everything and by looking at the dash, do you really want to do all that when you have your Porsche to finish.  Can't wait for all the lifts n stuff to be installed so we can witness greatness at DDE.
Those that didn't know now? Always known/seen him before...Mike was always underrated and a legend in the car community 🙌 ❤!
See if any of the working parts can go on Tim’s car. 😂
Why did you buy this heap of junk? Absolutely garbage
I’ve been asking for a while on doing a AMG GT build on the channel
Hey Mike, ever thought about a 928 manual? They are boats but would sounds sick straight piped.
There should be a manual release for the transmission to get it out of park
Engine swap to M156 or M159...
So, why this engine cannot be rebuit, like you change everything in it, on it and repolish it inside and tadaam.
I wonder how well that Mercedes would drift since it’s smaller looks like the engine could be pushed behind the front wheels and its rwd. Would sound awesome. I’m never gonna be in the market for anything like that but those amg v8s sound nasty🫶  Blame it on brain damage thanks taliban  Also fml  Also also of course there ain’t no engine behind the rear wheels look at that sexy little ass
Tow truck driver doesn't have a bottle of oil to squirt under the tires to slide it? Not a good tow truck driver!
How much money does one have to just leave an AMG GT in your driveway after you move?
I’m assuming it’s the same guy that got Mike to build that crazy C63 when Mike was showing his shop? Dudes a die hard AMG guy respect
Does that 4runner have a powersteering problem also?! Lol damn sean
Where is UV?
Could be a cracked head or bad oil cooler
They didn't use those stupid bio degradable wiring harnesses in those, did they? I know merc did that at a point, and they had to swap harnesses on warranty.
Mark you an inspiration always keep asking questions
What video is next?  The river of rain video………
