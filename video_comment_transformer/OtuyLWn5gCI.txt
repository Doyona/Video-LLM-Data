Great animation guys but can we like start moving the plot forward more, just doesn't feel like anything has changed in the story.
That last shot is so interesting lorewise. I wonder who’s in there, and why. There’s a good chance that the purpose of this base is to keep them in…and maybe a chance that this is Agent 8. Edit: that last bit aged poorly now that Vyse is out

I wonder if we'll ever get PvE for Valorant
Why is nobody talking about the end? Like who is that..
Also is that a hint at a possible new weapon? Looked like a rocket launcher or something but almost everyone else had normal guns. They could just as it for dramatic effect but almost everything in this cinematic was from the game except that and the grenade.

Why does it look like the texture quality has decreased with the previous trailers
But when is it coming out?
Is it me or the animation off?
why is no one talking about the end??? 💀 is it like a new agent ? or omen rework? idk
I feel like the animations are more 3D than before; the animations in the past felt 2D and much more detailed for some reason
Day 1 of asking Hindi text at the last scene. "Where every other popular language is displayed", for "Defiance"
Was that a new agent leak at the end or the other omen?
3:11 could it be.....agent 8? Maybe we're getting Agent 8 now in E9A2
Who was that at the end ? Looked like Reyna's hand.
3:09-3:15  can anyone can tell me who was inside?

New agent?
The coordinates being 70° 50' 1 10" N, 9° 00' 22 24" W, leading to the Norwegian Sea near the Arctic Ocean don't make too much sense.
What about valorant mobile ?
I hope the new character they hinted to is part creature/animal (referring to the claws). We got a robot, so what about a werewolf, demon (omen is a ghost /phantom), or an alien.
What is this aomination of a map? Its like you combined haven , pearl and fracture 💀
New agent? The end video..

Rocket launcher coming soon??
Aight listen, I know this is a map trailer but is 2:41 a tease that will be getting an rpg-type in the game? That'll be fun and f**ked up at the same time.

New suspence in end of vedio who was there inside. Is Omen? Or a another agent? 🤩🤩
Which map will they replace with this map Abyss?
Is this map available in Swiftplay?
Why is Clove 1 tapping with a spectre though lmao?
Wait wait wait wait wait. Does Scion have another omen???
why they give iso a tiny head and a giant fridge body
Soo 3 sites?
New agent already? Glad we dont need to wait whole 1 year for another one.
Riot does know how to make some good trailers ehh?
3:15 Lissandra it's that you?
Is the new map representing a new Agent.? Who has the hands like omen.?
3:16  new agent?
So basically 0 innovation ? Great riot
Bro at the end of the trailer was that a sign of new agent?
3:14 new agent ?
Why does this look like it was made in source
Why does that Vandal at the start sound like a stinger
Why can’t my spectre do that 😢
new agent? Or new game mode?  not mentioning the map of course I'm mentioning the omen like clone at the end.
Is it just me or does the animation seem a little off
What country is this?
potential agent leak?
Am i just the one kinda feeling that the cinematic right now feels like an MOBILE CINEMATIC ANIMATION?
Also new agent??
is that a new agent in the cage at the end of the trailer
what was the thing at the end? New agent? Or is it just an enemy..
Why omen always baddass like this? OMG, the real main character 🥶
Why did omen wanted to show fear to clove ?
isnt this that roblox valorant map?
Replay system when?
This was low-key their most boring game play cinematic.  Why only 3? Why those 3? What answers? What secrets?  They just keep edging us lol
was that on purpose or he really missed? 😭😭 2:25
Is this a just a new map or a gamemode?? Pve gamemode?
why is clove on half buy?
2:17 NAWW WHAT IS THAT
are they gonna switch the map rotation finally, they seriously kept in some of the most boring maps wtf, why does the game even need a "rotation" there's barely any maps unlike csgo, feels like they just copied it for the sake of copying it, or keep the rotation in competitive only if that's the reason
what was that cliffhanger....??? Is ther is new agent or some kind of monster packed in there..
Agent 8 comeback?
please please please how can i mute clove voicelines. howd yall pick a accent worse than brits
What the cringe?
Is it me or the dialogues in this cinematic feels kinda... Off?
woow the shading and animation work has fallen off
Now, its weird that iso isnt listed but i doubt they accidentally added yoru instead of iso. so the mystery agent in the hourglass at the end is likely Yoru  Edit: i just watche the end again, it looks nothing like yoru but yet the tag is there... hmm
New agent at the end?
2:48 what is clove saying??
What was the last hint about ?
new agent?? 3:15
Is it really no boundaries?
Does anyone know what gamemode this will be for?
Map looks good but when will it even arrive ?

new agent teaser at the end?
1:00 did you notice the different knifes on the wall
Is that new agent???
2:01 Did they really release a trailer with an ability that got completely reworked out? lol
is no one gonna mention that possibly new agent tease at the end??
In the last part, before the cinematic ends, someone's hand is moving. Is it the alternate omen or an indication of a new agent coming to valorant soon or are they gonna reveal agent 8 which was missing from the very beginning of the game which was started in 2020 (sage is numbered as agent 7 and phoenix as agent 9). Many questions are there from this cinematic that needs answers, fr.
Is that a new agent at the end🤔?
03:11 new agent? 🥸
yo why tf is this giving me chills rn
3:13 new agent???
New agent?
Finally a good map?
Love the game but for some reason the animation looks a lot more cheaper and not as good as before. Still like it, but feels like something’s off yk?

OMG is that agent 8 at the end???
2:24  Players can now actually fall in the map?
What's happened to the quality of this cinematic? Lightfarm and Blur produced such stunning visuals but this was really poorly rendered and animated. Looked like unpolished motion capture in some parts with lots of inconsistencies in the 2D drawn effects...
is it me or I feel this animation have lower budget than the other trailers?
New agent leak?
anyway, replay when ?
Starting to wonder if riot will ever actually give answers about valorant lore
3:15 am i trippin or is that a new agent
new  agent or is it omen at the end?
New weapon?!
Why there is no yoru in animations 😢
Is it just me or this animation looks like it was made in the paint?
3:13 who is this new agent?
Hmm, too many details of this fight, could have seen it with a replay system
it looks. Kinda generic? Dosent seem to have a theme going on really. It just looks like a "place" Dosent even have a gimmick going on for it, like Bind, or Fracture. L map maybe...
does this mean there are spots in the map that if you fall you could die?
We can fall off map?
New agent leak? Wonder if they can be seen inside the game while on the map
If all enemies and agents have the same guns, who are manufacturing and distributing them?
is there gonna be a place in map player can fall off of the  map and die? hmmmm........
Wait is Riot finally cooking?
Agent teaser at the end?
So no one gonna talk about the end?
3:15 we going horror mode @Riot?
2:26 oh dont tell me this new map has a death pit?

Anyone else think they changed Omen's EN voice actor?

New agent leak ?
3:13 New agent leak?
Fan which country is this new map based on???
when the upd is gonna drop?
3:15 new agent? or maybe he's agent 8
Possible new agent leak in the end ?!
Is it just me or this is the most low budget looks I've seen yet from Valorant cinematics 💀 I hope they didn't pay the same amount as the previous ones.
Is that new agent in the giant fridge? Or is another Omen?
How's no one here talking about 3:14?? The hand literally looks like omens'. Maybe an agent similar to him??
new character??
Was this both a new map reveal and a new qgent teaser?
Why does this animation feel unfinished? There a some scenes where the lighting and props feel dry/untextured?
There are going to be so many people dying to these pits 😂 The one where omen does the TP on, looks like you might only be able to jump onto it. Im not sure you can get off of the cliff without a movement ability, the ledges look too far/high up from the overhead shot. Maybe you'll be able to jump one way, with the slope, but not be able to go up. We'll see though  EDIT: You can 100% jump both ways no problem
this animation looked so bad i wouldve believed oyu if you said it was a fake leak, idk what you did but it doesnt look good
what about a replay system? no but honestly thx for all of ur work at riot
So new Omen agent coming soon and it looks like its a girl? Maybe his assistant, girlfriend, wife??
I want to know if there is actually some sort of platforming you have to do
Was that last part a tease to the next agent?
new gun ?? rocket launcher
ok but like an actual unique map for once???? riot? is it opposite day???
If clove is immortal, why is she playing like her life is on the line?
new agent tease at the end? or is it lore related
Why is no one talking about the person at the end!? :o
still waiting for replay system
How many people do you think will fall off the map on release? Since this map has "no boundaries".
is it just me or does this starting to look worse
NEW AGENT AT THE LAST!?!?!?
this map is gonna have hella gimmicks isnt it..?
Recently ive been having wierd ping spikes since the new update is that normal?
new agent in the end ? my be
Wait so… It’s a map you can just straight up walk into the void with?!   Welp. Good luck, ranked players. Now you gotta keep your tilted teammates from leaping off. LMAO
What happened to the animation??? This looks good, but fan-made compared to normal tbh
Name one cinematic where omen doesnt look cool
New character?
3:19 is it just me or is that omen?. OR A NEW AGENT
Is this gonna be a map where waves of enemies come at you?
can u actually fall off the map?
Could the person inside the vault be agent 8?
Please don't tell me the gimmick is that we can fall off the map 😭
New map and new agent??
why does the clove smoke look so goofy tho😭
is it me or is the trailer really low quality
When did Omen come back?
So, the new map is fallable? I mean we can dead if reach some edge of the map?
you can literally fall on this mpa? okay
I wonder if you can get onto that ledge where omen missed his knife
When is it coming out
A nu map who byss? Lmao
What's the hand
who was that at the end??? agent 8 ?👀
From a lore POV, I feel like this wasn't well planned out. The trailer doesn't really explain what secrets we're looking for or to who it is connected with, or am I wrong? Like it's obviously the same secrets Omen has been after the entire time, right, but did we learn anything new about these secrets?
Kaiju maybe? Imagine if they made a PVE of some kind with that Lore drop.
New agent at the end?
Anyone know what country is this map?
Did anyone else see the odd weapon one of the guards was holding? Looked like some sort of rail gun or rocket launcher to me. Could we have a new gun on the way? Who knows.
I wonder when will they use fade again in these cinematic thing???
Who’s big spooky in the hour glass thing at the end?
At the end... Thats Omen right?... Thats just Omen being a hostage... Right?
2:30 is that tiny wall to step  available ingame??
Agent 8 release? 👀
Its only me or textures and shadows are very bad?
Why does the animation style keep changing, this looks ugly af. "Reckoning", "Warm-Up" and "Revalation" had the best animation style
Netflix series when?
1:53 clove wallhacking  Edit : DEAR VALORANT Can u ban racist players ? SPECIALY FRENCH PPL 💀
ayoo what was that at the end??? 👀
that one guy at the end seemed to be holding some sort of rocket launcher, maybe a new weapon?
Maybe the replay system has been at the bottom of the abyss?!
A PIT JUMP TO A ROPE??? I’M INTERESTED YESSIR!!!
I feel like that map would look better with a replay system
Was the last bit a teaser for a new agent?!😮
pls tell me there is actually a pit in the map that anyone can fall in cuz it's gonna be funny asf
Maybe new agent? Or new boss? New game mode?
