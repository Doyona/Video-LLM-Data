What season was this
Did Roe really just throw a fit over not being able to take over a pan of chicken. The guy was literally cooking it for her and she flips out that she doesn't get to finish it.
4:10 does Chef Andi technically contaminate the food when she tastes it then shakes the excess back in the pan?
Is anyone else bothered by how close she has her face to the pan when she is basting the steak? That heat directly on her face is probably making her sweat all over the food, not to mention any spit that is coming out of her mouth when she is talking...
Bro how is the dream machine doing this. Repeating orders accurately? Id be dying halfway through service if i was there
Where’s JP? What season is this?
Did she tast it and than did the spoon back in again ?
Basically 1v6 ......One guy doing it all-James🔥 Andy who?😂
Who tf is Steve Blake? Certainly no celeb...
Fifteen Michelin-stars divided over how many restaurants?
Did anybody else catch what I saw?????  Andy, (sous chef) tastes the rice,  then slapped the rest on the spoon BACK into the same pan!!! Did I see that right??? Even if it didn't have rice on the spoon, it still has saliva, right??? Shouldn't you taste then get a new spoon???
Why gordon so holding back...hes not mad like he used to be😂
8:49 who tf this
This is from 20yrs ago why cant yall put the date of these old ahhhz videos it says posted 4 days ago and lots of these dumbahzzz people think its NEW
4:12 did she just straight up taste and just smack everything back into the pan?
What season is this one
Been on a Hell’s Kitchen clip binge for a while now and I have to say…  Does anyone else notice that Chef Ramsay has a tan line around his eyes in most of the clips? I wonder if he rides motorcycles or goes skiing or something.  Either way, put on some sunscreen my man.
Making a risotto taste exceptional is hard. Making one look exceptional is probably near impossible, as ALL the other stuff looked great, while the risottos were... well... Not nearly as good looking.
Why is Gordon’s forehead so red?

Hey wait a minute Chef James shares his last name with the late great James Avery?  He should get to toss a contestant out physically for that!
My question is. Where is chef Christina!? I worked with chef James and he’s sooo cool! Still need Christina in these!
Why do I hear boss music?
How is this, Gordon still in business? Why is he putting his fingers on the customer food? The main reason I dont eat at places like that, how disgusting it is?
Why does Gordon Ramsey have to use filthy language? What’s wrong with him and others who use that language? They set a terrible example for others, especially young people  They should be ashamed of themselves
Whats the point with ramseys pen behind the ear?
4:07 she just tastes the food and drops back in the remains that her mouth 100% made contact with back in the pan?

No one notice Penn Jillette on 4:44 ?
Why are they just staring at it instead of probing?
why does the narrator sound like roger craig smith
@4:11 did Andi just taste the food and use the same spoon to keep cooking with?
Who's going to win this? 1:23😂

You see gordan smirk with chef andi asking chef jimmy for those chicken😂 Gordan trolling the bro

Why do transformers have mouths? Can’t they just produce audio from speakers?
4:10 Did she shake off the food on her spoon that she just put in her mouth back into the pan?
At 4:11 Chef Andy tastes her risotto and then knocks the rest of it off back into the pan after tasting. Am i crazy or does that seem like it was a mistake?
Am I the only one who noticed that she tapped the same spoon she used to taste the risotto back into the pan? 4:10
why does gordon looks so young??
how is gordon floating between 2 kitchens while cooking as well as keeping blue in check
Why are the cooks dressed up like 2000s gangster.?
4:11 did she just tasted and then tapped the same spoon in the pan ????
‘You like the flavor?’ That is some grade-A natural conversation
Who tf is Steve Blake 😂😂
By the time they get to black jackets are the people normally actually good enough to work in restaurants? like cooking multiple dishes at once. because it doesnt awlays feels like they highlight the chefs as being super good
Did Andy lick the spoon and use it again? Lol 😆
4:10 😳😳😳  test food with spoon and take food left in spoon back into pan?
Isn't this completely fake?   Everybody here seems to assume it isn't but I am not sure why.
Is this food wars live action?
What’s the goggle tan lines on Gordon hahah
Is that Roger Craig Smith???
Why does it seem Gordon is a alot more calm in s13 compared to s20 and up
Did Andy eat from the pan of the spoon and then tap it against the side of pan?!!  The risotto has Andy’s spit in it!!! (At the 4:07 mark)
Is the narrator the voice of Batman in Arkham Origins?? Sounds so familiar
I would like to talk to attorney matt murdock. Do you know when he will be available?
Who won this season?
How much of this show is acted out???
What’s Omaha steak doing at Hells Kitchen? Eating someone else’s steak?
Not that I care about what Andi did in 4:11, but isn't that bad practice that Gordon has blasted someone before for doing the same thing?
Do yall know the season and episode?
Why anyone works in a kitchen is beyond me
where is jp?
How does gordan ramsay not burn out?
3 of us? It was 2.5 at best Gordon was too busy yelling at the other team

I wonder if those rich people would eat there knowing raw hands are touching all your food without gloves .

How can you mess up scallops
Where is Jean Phillipe??
I wonder how he met Andy if she like applied randomly shes in charge of everything
Does Chef Ramsay have a sunburn on his face??
i dunno. how do u be a chef if u cant tell if the scallops or lobsters are raw or not and does it have to be so toxic
4:07 anybody saw that chef on gordon ramsay's team tasting the dish with a spoon and then proceed to put the remaning food from the spoon into the pan????🤮
What season and episode is this please

Will you share yours with me? 👉👈. No.
What's the point of comparing 3 ALL STAR chefs beating 6 NOOBS?   Did anyone expect anything different?
Did no one catch the chef tasting the food and hitting the spoon back on the bowl at 4:15???
Anyone else catch the chef sample her food then shake the same spoon back into the pan …the SAME pan she will be serving the food from? No ma’am!!!
At 4:11 Andi eats with spoon and shakes the left overs into the pan?
I like how they keep asking where’s the food, like doing that will speed time up😂
Am I trippin or did Andy legit just slurp some risotto off the spoon and then mix up her saliva with the rest? 💀😬 4:10
Not to break away from the show. But is that Rodger Craig Smith narrating the show?
Anybody else see Chef Andi make that booboo @4:11 ?

Is there anymore uncut scenes that could be released?
Nailed? James, my boy, that meat is raw
4:11 did Chef Andy just do what I think she did?
Why would you ever choose the other team's menu?
where is Christina in this!!??  I have a crush on Christina.
Is this in vegas at caesars palace?
Why do I love watching chefs stress so much 😂
Did Andi just eat something from a spoon and then tapped the spoon on the pan that has food for the dinner tables at 4:10?
Any chance of some full seasons and episodes?
Why are we back to this season? This season already has soooo many videos; including of this exact service.
I wonder if Chef James was ever given the nicknames Shredder or Uncle Phil?
