How did BC not make a completely stupid inappropriate sexual joke in a 9 minute interview? I rarely listen to him longer than 2 minutes before turning him off. Well done BC
Is this wrestling?
Wtf was the point of this video fuck cbs
No highlights???
Lol wtf? They they replaced the Russian flag with a UFC logo? 🤣🤣🤣
Why can't these announcers learn how to say the name of some of the most popular people in the sport? Shameful.
Why don't these guys in Khabibs camp ever really fight other guys that are wrestlers and grapplers? They always fight stand up boxers and those type of guys right? I feel like Matt Hughes and GSP etc the old school wrestling ground and pound guys would wreck them.  Chael Sonnen would whoop their ass right?
Why nobody showing us the submission part 😂
Who give this man black belt? We have to check this brother
That ankle twist was insane. Dustin was so good in defending those holds but man how do you see something like that coming in R5?
