Dear Katy, I try to follow the recipes as they are except when I have to make them gluten free but many times your delicious recipes are already gluten free which is great! One question: can I cook this lovely cake in the air fryer? If yes, for how long and what temperature? Merci bcp! 🏵
Could you use cottage cheese for this?
