can we have another SM GAME CATERERS with the whole SM Family? if it's not possible then can we have all NCT units instead?
Why do they keep giving oxygen tanks? These guys need electrolyte / rehydration drinks. Oxygen maybe but it  is the essential salts/water that really need replacing. This is very sweet and funny though. 🎉 Suho looks defeated 😢😂
There should be a music quiz between Key and Seungkwan 😭
does key listen to kpop all day long? lol he knows everything, including the choreo 😭
Suho, are you so old that it's so hard to guess the song correctly?😂😂
Watching the older idols take care of the maknaes is so nice 😭 Key and Leeteuk being so supportive of Woobin, and Hyoyeon and Suho asking Karina if she’s eating well. It’s so nice to see them look out for younger people in their profession c:
when the JYPE  X 15nights?🥺
How does Key know dancing every songs!? So amazing
What soobin doing there?
i am sorry for not knowing this, suho have a breath condition?
I want Key and Seungkwan play the music quiz😂
6:23 WHY THIS SONG REMINDS ME OF “Dragostea din tei” by O-Zone?🫣
Am i the only one who thinks key sounds like boo seungkwan...i mean their personality is similar
Am I the only one who as soon as hearing the song candy, I could immediately visualize seungkwan singing fearless and yunjin dancing to it in hybe x game caterers ❤?
14:32 literally my fav question because the one’s left genuinely use their last braincell to randomly guess 😂
Did they seat them by the year the debuted? We are missing some groups like f(x)
Every member's face on the jellies?? What about han?
6:00 THERE’S A KOREAN REMAKE OF DRAGOSTEA DIN TEI??!?! 🤣🕺🏼
Doyoung face when they asked him how he fold towel🤣
23:46 what happened to key in this part? lol
what’s the spray can key and suho used?
18:59 Karina throwing better punches than Mike ? 😂
Wonbin was like what can I do. is a noona and a gen above me. 😂😂
Can anyone tell me the name of the songs?
Xmsms UI wwiwuwwiwiues e what is it with wyw
DRAGOSTEA DIN TEI ISN'T THE ORIGINAL SONG ???
Kim kibum is Wang of music quizzes.❤
I was key when dream girl arrived. Goshh first song in these quizzes of na pd I finally guessed.❤😅
Excuse me, but what did suho spray in the his mouth in  43.50?
I need a Music quiz between Key and Seungkwan and I need it asap!!!

The way Suho asked karina if she’s eating well was so cute he is like a brother 😭😭
Changmin looks soo confused as too why Key knows all the dances hahahhaa
If I write EXO name how many likes I get?
whats that they are spraying onto their mouths?
3:25 That's a great Start of their music quiz like 2016 indeed was BLACKPINK yr also kpop was thriving back then 😭🖤💝
Whys key so hilarious
Why are the 4th gen idols so awkward with each other whereas 2nd gen just vibing like siblings 😂
Do any one remember joshua by looking at the prize

Does Suho not interested in music?
karina's so damn funny wtf? like she got the SM blood SM artists are always funny on any show
What are they inhaling?
I wonder who's better on music quiz: Key or Heechul 💙
Is it me or is the song at 6:00 just dragostea din tei?
They way Karina casually asking Key to dance Touch my Body😅😅😅😅
1:50 Hyo asking a question that is frequently asked by teams who have more than 7 member 😂 cause they always HAVE to split everything 😅
can jyp kids be on this show, want to see the whole jyp group guess the song and dance to it they are very good at dancing
Why's suho lowkey the chanhyuk of sm family😭🤣🤣
Okk but tell me that I'm not the only one who thinks seventeen's seungkwan and KEY kinda looks similar , specially here like really he's even  talking  with a pout and giving expressions  like him and him knowing most kpop songs is just soo seungkwan of him one is ace and other is professor of kpop
why karina is so funny and pretty??? 😭😭😭
key being a senior in music quizes due to being a member of nolto
29:24 Why SM ppl think of rude when they talk about YG/ hiphop? Hul, I guess that’s why the racist ones come from SM’s groups   And the funny thing is that the most respectful idols come from YG (90° bow) unlike the new generation of idols (not SM in particular)
Y’all think they’ll ever do a JYPE vs HYBE vs SM vs YG vs Starship vs other company type content?? 😅 or that’ll be too scandalous 🤔🙃
Does anyone know why they keep spraying oxygen?
Metro city???
This is up there as one of the funniest music quiz pure chaos, sibling family bickering loool
suho leadernim are you okay 😂🤭
12:08 why does he remind me of bretman rock here 😭
Why do I feel like they are bullying suho 😢
Why does watching Key sunbae remind me of boo seungkwan ?
Why is Seulgi so cute
What kind of caffeine does kibum run on😭😭😭 wonbin is getting babied so hard love to see it🥺
The song at 6:10 is a Korean Song?!!! Gosh that was so popular back then I thought it was a Latino song
yeah if its a quiz on kpop music you not beating Key at all 😭😭
Key was so funny during the quiz music lmao
Ok but why changmin seems genuinely shocked that key knew blackpink's song and choreo 😂
26:55 oh my god I love it 💚💚💚 what a legendary quiz
Can we just insert Changmin in every variety show? The man is hilarious 😁❤️
Can we talk about key's enthusiasm? He's so competitive lol😂
Am i the only one who's not getting to see the song's name in English captions?
Is there anything way for use to tag JYP!!!!!! ?
This was so fun! So many funny moments. Doyoung holding Kangta's hand like an old man to dance to Candy song was hilarious! Is it impossible to ask for more videos of them together again? 😄
18:54 SUHO, what was that?
wonbin~ why are you so honest ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
32:15 how can key be this energetic 😂😭
Omg suho what are you doing😂😂😢
The music quiz shines as always. WAHAHAHHAHAHA
Suho is so funny 😅 i love him sm. he chose the years but he couldn't answer the question ❤ such a lovely 🐰
Are they releasing all the eps today?
so does the middle child syndrome also apply here, seeing how sm treats the groups in the middle……….
I think WONBIN's picture?-?
