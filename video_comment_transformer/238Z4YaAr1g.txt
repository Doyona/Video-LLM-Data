Is this supposed to be country music?
Why does she have to be naked? Is she a strip teaser or a musician? Shame on the human race. Shame on the men who tell the women to publicly undress and Shame on the women who do it. And this one definitely doesn't need the money. What is she at? No dignity, integrity, or sovereignty.
Why does she keep doing the same movements 😂 1:56
Didn’t she just copy madonna? She made a country song in 2000. Trust me, Beyoncé can’t write lyrics, dance moves, notes or anything. She just copy’s other and says she’s original
Is this 2025's version of creative genius?
How do they keep her nipples from popping out? I watched that clip 34 times and I still don't know. Are they glued to taped to the jacket?
She's one of gay z's help and you call them your family , even if I'm telling you I don't want you , why would you still f with them ?

Why aren’t the other artist listed as feature artists?… her and Drake move the same way. I would have said no. I want my name on the song. People need to stop worshipping this woman and start thinking with their pockets like she does.

What if we helped both the border problem and the drug problem with kindness.  Send the immigrants back across the border with the drugs they supposedly bring.  If mexico doesnt take the drug, thus helping the economy, tyen at least the immigrant returning hime with nothing can join the cartel.

This shit ain’t country, wtf is this??
Hey shaboozey, my friend, if my back and neck are constantly cracking and feel like bone on bone, but they dont hurt and i am stronger than i have ever been, should i snap crackle pop or see a doctor?  Doctors (not blaming) alwasys result in me being sick and needing to be on medicine.  And i dont have a job and dont have medical insurance or a current address.  I think i am going to hang from trees and be tik tok famous for having the coolest filters and songs.  I took yours for the project.

Beyonce does country? Alright I'll give it a listen... This can't be the song that won her a Grammy. Garbage and not country.
What is this crap? 😨
If this is her most popular song then what is the rest 😂
Best album? ????The Grammys like football are fixed!
Is this the song that won a Grammy🥴?!
This song won a Grammy? Questioning who did choose it to be the first? So weak song .... not enough for a Grammy.
And she win  Grammy for country music??? Total fraud
Honestly asking, why did this win a grammy? Like...okay yea it's great but there are better ones right? Or is there something really special bout this which I could not figure out...?
Guess you can can elevate yourself to be too good for a few minutes of choreography??
How does anybody view this as country music

I have doubts about the grammy, looks like that the judge was Beyoncé fans than judges.
How’d they get those hangers to stay up like that? Looking forward to the making of 👍

Is there humans in this comment section?  Sounds strangely digital.   The video itself is surely lacking 😢
Really???????
what kind of shit music is this
Why is she naked?  Country isn’t naked! It’s about the music not the titiies!
why does it have to be overly sexual? everything is ass and titties....this is barely country and this song is the most country song in her album lmao
I don't see a ton of likes for any of the songs on the album, seems like a grammy win would have millions of likes.  What am i missing?
how this fucking shit win the grammy ?
What is this 😂😂😂😂
Was ist das,  Country Musik ?😕
While she does does a nice version of the song, wasn’t this done before %?

Seriously, this won?  The corruption is everywhere. Unreal.
What the hell is this dogshit... people actually listen to this???
WTF did I just watch?
how is this country? and why did it win a grammy 💀
Is this some sort of a count sheep to sleep thing? Feels like it could do the same job to me.
The song and video repeats over and over again and again… typical with today’s music???
Why  does she always have to parade around half naked and doing the same stupid thing? Ghetto meets country, Yuck!
Is anyone else here to celebrate her winning a Grammy for Best Country Album?
Not even "country" wtf is this shiii?
wtf is this....
Why is she half naked....and what is the point here...???  She just won album of the year for this one the Grammys.....I can't see why...for this...the other artists had allot more hits on their albums.....smh....
why does she have to use some of the unsavory language and sexy nothing for clothes? I will never understand someone with a great voice just pushes profanity, sex and money in her videos. Sad, just sad.
Is this a joke song making fun of country music or something? This might be the worst song ever recorded
do people actually like this?
What is this hidden socciety stuff 👁👌  This isnt a coincidence
Swifties still crying? You need to let it go.
When did singers decide appearing almost naked added to their talents..is this her hubby's influence... just makes her look cheap and the video is crap...
So this is ain't women sexualization? Snake on one eye - sure no symblism at all...hope we can finally open our eyes on their cult and who are they serve
Erm why is her yk showing?
This can't be the same Beyonce that sang "Irreppaceable"...this has to be a prank right?
Am i the only one that doesn't get the focused nudity of a great song, or are we only liking this song because of the nudity .. or suggestion of it. Music should be about quality of sounds not being perfect, not about being half naked to sell .. my opinion, but nudity is getting to much focus to sell a record  .. sorry
Why Video this?
anyone in January 2025?
Anyone on January 2 2025?
Ask yourself is her lyrics country be truthful and if it's not country please give me a example of what country is The first you have to put your hate and your evil spirit aside now let's get your honest opinion
Anyone in January 2025?
Anyone in January 2025?
Park your Lexus???...in the country?? Yuck and no, we don't drive lexus in the country. Also what the eff is this video
That outfit was really necessary? Can't she afford clothes, i.e. some trousers, a shirt or something?
WHAT KIND OF CALIFORNIA GARBAGE IS THIS CRAP?!
I still love this song. Who else listening to it in December 2024 ?   ... from Fort Worth, Texas
What is this horsesht? No wait that’s disrespectful to horsesht everywhere.
So does she pay Lyle royalties…?  (See LA County)…
Who here super balls ?❤️❤️❤️  Queen 👸🏽 B❤
Who’s here after NFL performance?? 😂❤
Who's here after the NFL half show 😭
Is this a real music video?
Is that all she does...dam I'm not impressed.  She's smokin hot but she's also an amazing performer.  I'm upset no dance moves.
Why the heck is the same 5 seconds visual repeating over and over and over for the entire 4 minute video?
Is there anyone from Texas who also loves Beyoncé ? This song and  Beyoncé will forever be in my heart!
I am witnessing an abomination.. wtf is ts😭😭
Is this a land of freedom?
How was this song even created. Did they not listen to it before they released it.

OMG why she just walk 😂😂
Is this shyt nominated to Grammy? Fokofffffr
Wow does she not know how to wear clothes?  Now I know why I don't listen to her
is it up for "worst song of the year" and "worst music video ever"?
What in the MK Ultra is this video supposed to be?  No way I am watching this all the way through with music playing.  Like the song love, but you are so far down the scary path, there are no words.
Who is there after Grammy's nomination?
the fuck is this shit?
Not one song made it on the radio?! Or any charts? Why?!
I’m old school is it necessary to be half naked in a video. Growing up our artist wore clothes that covered them up and their voices and dance moves sold albums. This video is just a disgrace.
Is it just me or does this sound like “Slumber” by NeedToBreathe?
What has country become…
One would think that one so famous wasn`t forced to appear half-naked for a country song. Why? Isn`t the song dope enough?
When will she go to jail?
Is this one of the Freak Off outfits? 😍
Why are they always 17 comments on every video I’m watching 😂
? Chloe on remaster
why is she dressed like its  a CORN video  ??
You mean no twerking made it into this? This song is stupid. I'm talking "whistling solo" stupid
Why haven't YouTube deleted this demonic low intelligent psychopaths music yet?
I dont get how country music folks didnt welcome Beyonce yet Dolly Parton stepped into Rock and Roll and was so welcomed she was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame. Wtf?

What such a tacky setup for a great song??
Is this the official video? Huh???
Uhh not Country whatsoever...what is this
She cancelled yet?
How can she doo that to other celebs like that
Why is this so freaky
This can't really be the video right lol
Why does she have to make country music nakes as well......
Is this KI?
God why do some people in the comments still rave about her? We all know and SHE KNOWSSSSSS
Where did this song go?
Why are all the comments hate like???
who is there after the puff daddy affair ?
What’s’ next? Garth Brooks doing rap?! What the hell is this? Slick marketing won’t work.
I wonder why shes been called the queen? Like wheres the queen vibes
What an example she sets for her daughters and other young girls ?
To go country Beyonce may  consider fidddels and steel guitar . . . just a thought
Is she a cyborg
I love this song but why does she touch her body it is weird!
Is this Nicole Aniston?
What? No saloon? No line dancing? No ten gallon hat? No cowboy boots? No choreography? No electric bull or horse? As far as I'm concerned this music video is incomplete!
how is this country?
Why she is half nude and not in a Cowboy dress? 🤔
What is this? The diva starts singing along to the chop? Scouts sing better songs by the fire with a guitar! It's a very very weak performance..
Why even bothered 😂
What the hell is this?? This is nasty bad!
Don't know if I like the song, but the video sucks.
A 'country' song - really?...
Wtf is this video????
Horrible on All levels.  And why is she half naked?
Is this a joke?
Does she have nipples?
Wonder if this has a hidden  meaning
Why oh why do female singers think they need to sex it up to be successful. If you're a good singer, you are -- without the pole stripper outfit. Respect yourself.
This is not country we grew up listening and watching everything country because of my mother believe me she knew country and this is not it, if she had gone with a different video performance probably would have been nominated what is the point of this video the song yes her singing yes the video performance no    Her performance with Bruno Mars at the Super Bowl and the people involved  setting all that up was excellent   Charley Pride he is country
What about the Kids seeing an old granny like this???
Were we going for the stupidest video of all time there Bey? If so .... Nailed it.
cant tell what was annoying the song or the video on replay
Maybe she could put some damn clothes on first??
Wtf is this bullshit
Then what state
*I just learned that this song doesn't have an official video... WHY???*
What's funny is #1 song is based on play time. Her husband paid to have it played so is it bcuz of that? Or the ACTUAL popularity of the song? Sorry it's not a bad song but country? No it's not.
Wait how did they get out?!? I need to know wtf?!?
I prefer to watch the Tik Toks, what kind of video is this?..
"Visualizer"?! What the fuck is that? What about a music video or nothing? And why is she half-naked? What does it have to do with country music? =__=
Is My New Freestyle to Beyoncé’s song Beautiful Liar Good??
Hello ! What s name please or tuto ? Thank s ❤

Where is the live version? 😮 No qualitativ live version from the renaissance World tour. 😢
What TF is even this? Bro.
What the fuck did I just watch and listen too 😢😢😮
Country? 😂
Why does she have to be basically naked to do this video? Isn’t she too old for that like I can hear a song without looking at naked women right?
Are female singers forbidden to wear clothes in Western societies or what?!
how does the jacket still cover your b**bs when your walking pretty fast
I wonder how many times her vest showed her chest 2:12
Would you jack of to he outfit 🤔 (btw this is a joke question)
How the fuck is this country
can anyone here tell me what this song is supposed to be about?
What's with the porn?
What you get when you cross sorta-country with sorta-porn?
True question: what’s the point of a visualizer?
Wtf? I'm uncomfortable!
HOw many loop is this?
Why do woman think they MUST show their breasts? They leave nothing to the imagination!
When you open and touch your boobs does it make a better show if you are good and trust your music you dont need this show of sexism
I'm woundering why she has to show boobs to be seen.   I don't.
They couldn’t find clothes for her for this video?
What the hell is even that, lawd  Nooooooooooooooooooooo
Is she actually white?

Love the song, but what does this video have to do with the song?! What a waste of video
Is it ok to hate this? Tipsy 1000% better.
Where is full Video of this song @beyonce
The music is dang cool, but do the lyrics actually contain or attempt to convey any message? If so, please explain. Not asking for a friend.
Out of all the people on YouTube that made dance videos to this song waiting for her video to come out this is it? Walking naked and shooting an imaginary gun over and over? I know it's not from lack of knowing how to dance she's a professional dancer I don't get it?
Who else is here in June 2024
Is it just the same thing over and over again what's the point🫤
What you ordered online vs what is delivered...
I like the tune, but what in the 2024 Texas ILLUMINATI is this video? Also, why does my tablet autocorrect ILLUMINATI to capital letters?
It really really good but why wouldn't she add more then her just walking up?.. but overall how dose she trust that jacket one her 😅 really good I mean it 😊
Why do all these so called female pop stars frel they have to show the riskay parts of there flesh off.  All generic and dumb ...wake up citizens dont pay to see future rotted flesh.

tho its the short where is the short?
Idk what the hype is about this song, it's annoying
Why this music video on repeat?
um why does it say 57 seconds for more then like ten second i didnt know that was possible
Did an AI write these lyrics? They play this song all the time at my workpalce and everyone hates it. Many of them are fans of her too
i know she is dressed for show but what makes them think that  nakedness is beautiful because it’s not.  makes her look cheap. she is such a beautiful woman she doesn’t have to portray herself like that.
That music video......?????
Is Beyonce dressed as a sexy Borg?
Same why do they have her doing the same thing over in over
She's a mother yet still dresses like this?? Really?....
Is this Culture cancelling?
How come she’s not wearing a cowgirl outfit?🤷‍♀️…she’s almost naked singing like a caw girl…not matching!..no,no!,..love the song 🎶 though 👍 ?
Country music? Lexus? This isn’t country I wanna hear some confederate railroad ain’t there ain’t never been no Lexus in my driveway driving by anyone.
What the fuck is this🤣🤣
When Blue is going to do a nose job and turn blonde?
I get the visuality thing and cool, but I’d just like to see her do a traditional music video that’s alittle more story telling. Still am pleasantly surprised. ❤
So they just did one clip and put it in a loop and that’s the music video nowadays?
Do people not know what a visualizer is?
Who is here in 2030?
Where's her shirt at??
Anyone know how I can block this video so my kids don't  give her streams .
Song just goes nowhere...
Is this a Playboy advertisement, I'll buy the book so i can 👀👀 no vest, no worries, 😂
why is beyonce so white? when she first became famous she was much darker. in my opinion, making her more white is insulting to black americans.
Did Beyonce set out to make a gif and not a pop video.. I don't understand we're this was going or were it's not going..
where did them curls come from
Why does Beyonce videos and pictures look like porn recently....
I’m confused where is the rest of the video?
This woman can dance her ass off... so why do they have her doing the same thing over and over!!!😮
What the hell did I just watch. Wtf kinda none existing outfit was that? That was horrible.
What the hell did I just listen to?
How many deez comments bots

What’s this? Its country feel, but you’re not it. You’re too famous.
Why are you doing country?  You’re not country at all at all at all.  Did you sell yourself to the Illuminati or something?  Makes no sense.  Don’t care about the boob flash at all.  Please stop.
Stupid song and absolutely boring video. What exactly is the point of this video? Is it just to show off her body?
Anyone that is talking is about her and her music ask yourself if u can do it. U guys stop hating on her. U do something better than her.😂😂😂😂😂
This is country? It’s literally just a fast pace franklins theme song with the most used words in every country song

I like the song, but why does she have to show her off her body? Makes no sense.
2 questions.  1. Why are her tits out, do shirts not exist to pop stars?  2. why is there so few dislikes? MAKE THIS THE MOST DISLIKED VIDEO!!!
😳I was hoping to see her dancing or something else? 😅
Ummm….. why….?
Have to dress like a $2 farm implement??
Producer: What type of dance routine are we gonna use on this video?  Beyonce:  Nah.

What happened to her voice? I thought it was a dude?
Was it necessary to be half naked ???

This music sounds like some Indian song don’t know why
This is the song played at our school when transitioning like what???😂
I don't know what to say is she just making money in country music 😂
Can't white people have one thing, this is cultural appropriation lmao

What's with everyone jumping on the country bandwagon? Am I missing something? Should I make a country album? I don't have tits though...
This is country?
Why is she have naked?
Why is she dressed so sleazy?  This song absolutely sucks.
Why is there so many haters maybe that's Y..  Beyonce did it always will love this beautiful amazing woman. . End of discussion everybody's got an opinion and that's mine
Why she didn't have dance to go with the song on video
I keep hearing she’s no country singer, but it’s not too Bad, maybe if the video had some plot to it, it would probably add some Diversity?
Texas porn here! Why is she always half naked in her song ????
I just want to know why the fuck this came up in my country playlist feed this is not country music
Tf is this???
Am i watching a glitch video 😂

WTF is this???     What?  Her and J run out of ideas or what??    Time forever lost.
Was she assimilated by the Borg? She seems to have a Seven of Nine thing going on.
How's her after hearing shaboozy a bar song 😢
Where is that Texas dance we came in to see from Bronco Texas Beyonce? This visualization lacks substance.
Why does  she  have  her  boobs out
Why is she not singing,  and why does she have to be halfway naked
yall realize it said visualizer and not music video?
Is that country ? Us are lost😢
Trying yo to figure out the plate on her face
She went country? Wtf kind of country is this
Is the whole video her doing that??
Why is she dressed like that, they say her album is breaking records, what's this world coming to
Yall seem to think “visualizer” and “complete music video” are the same thing….😅 I do not believe that’s the case lmao
Wait.  This is real?  Not a joke?
what is the flow? and how can one be taken to it?
I love Beyonce but why is she over here disrespecting country sorry but not sorry her country is not good and it's messing everything up I don't even know if I could even call it country it's not even close to it
Am I the only one who don't understand this video at all??
The song is great, but what's the point of this video? Is Beyonce now too good to make a proper music video? Especially with country, you could make such an awesome video.
Does she not know black youth have a crime issue, wonder how she’s giving back to America 🤢
what is this catching song, weird revealing outfit and the dance is on loop
At this point her and Jay Z need to pull a Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain move and see who can survive a heroin induced game of Russian Roulette.
Music?
I'm loving this but why does it keep playing the same thing over again.
K but why does this sound like the Franklin theme song😂😂😂
Who’s still listening in 2024
is it just me or is this song kanda racist?
Why is it the same thing over and over again?
What the hell was she thinking!?
Do guys play roblox
And I just said when has Beyonce ever been in a dive bar I just question that one part
So, no hold hold down on your dress either?  Is this a  country song ?
Oops I tought it was a video and song from the 90s or the 2000s😅
Why do american women have to be half naked in making a song video?
Why is her things out
Where has real county outfits gone 😢
i just got told this clip has a song attached ?
What the actual fuck is this?
Why would she try country?
Why, as they get older, do they have to go Full SLAPPER in the videos?
I wonder how the disliked this video is?
What the heck is she wearing???
why why this is what mk ultra does fro that decision making
What’s the point of this ‘visualizer’?
I love this song but why can’t the video be classy? Why resort to that outfit?
Is it necessary to show your breasts? What a shame about the song so great.
Who got screwed over for her benefit?
Why does she need to be half naked to present the song? I love the song and Beyoncé‘s boobs on their way out are just disturbing 😂
why is there so many dislikes what is going on? this song is so good
Beyonce have alot of trust in the vest then my life but why does she keep on doing the same thing it's fun in the beginning but once you see it enough it's annoying 💀
Is this really her clip ? I was expecting something more different for this time, something rustic and natural. They really could have make an effort.
how cheap can a billion air make a film clip for?
Cultural appropriation if you ask me 😂😂😂
what is a visualizer
Why such great artists woman Has to look like sexual objects? 😑
Who else came here after listening to "Franklin the turtles" Theme song?
Can't she do anything with clothes on
When wil the actual music video drop????? Isn't she making music videos anymore?
what is the name
The same 10 secs over and over ? This is ridiculous.
The fuck is she wearing?!
Ew wtf… this is disrespectful to country music. Plus this is just an awful loop of her half naked?!? Do people even get creative anymore?
Can someone stop her now please? Please!?
Is the record skipping  ? I know the video is
Is she fat?
Pour some liquor or sugar on you? Wait wait, just asking! Either way YES!
babe what is this😭🙏
wtf is this dribble
Wtf is this
My question why does it go all over and over again
I'm not even a Beyoncé fan but how come people in this comment section don't know what a visualizer is
She she gets to culturally appropriate? I see…
I'm in a pick up  I'm in the back seat  I'm with my cousin  where is this going
Why does it kind of show her boobs🤮🤮🤮🤮
So now its okay for others then black to dress or have their hair so called black?
And why do they have to always show cleavage shows young girls it's ok
I wonder if Diddy helped out?  According to word in the streets, He "helped" her allot.  Always had her "back" too.
What does being half nekkked have to do with country?
Franklin the turtle is that you?
Why do they have her doing the same thing over and over ?
Anyone notice the slight glitching on her chest? Maybe video is heavily edited
Any Taylor Swift country music inspiration ?
Why is she naked for a country song tho
Why is it needed to be dressed like that? Sooo low so awful?
I am here out of curiousity. I have no desire to ever watch or listen to it again...
This visualizer sucks. Is this AI?
Question where you all think country music come from and who made country music first ok I’m waiting
Like why do they have her doing that over and over again
Who would you vote for, as next President to the US, Beyoncé or Taylor? Considering the competion.
Trash . Appropriating what now ?! Pure Aids
this much money,still looping the video,VFX when?
Texans must be pissed? Maybe enough to get Trump elected again 😂
I really don't get the get-up she's wearing, that stripper look??? A country stripper song??? Not really T & A, just T & T.
Beyonce what is this😭
She ever heard of tin horn?
What is ths sht?
Wtf did I just watch???😂
Who else is here from the Tommy J video?
she is a talented musician, dose she really needs to  dress like this to sell the album ????
Why is she half naked???
PERFECTION? If you want the closest video to whatever you like to family friendly to sexy then try the song Que Bello ft. Kika Edgar. Kika's video will make this Beyonce's video look like used toilet tissue.
What's up with the music video?  Looks bad.
Idk abt yall, but no bullet proof vest = instant death in a texas bar fight
wow...don't know much about Beyonce..is that her in the video or a body double !!!
Beautiful woman, great voice. Is it really necessary to be almost naked? I don't get it.
What it cost to make this video? $500? Lol
People are wondering why they repeat this clip     It's so that Jay Z can finally stop having to rely on viagra     Hopefully
Who is here after taylor released new album?🎉
Did she have to copy the Franklin the Turtle theme song?
Why is she naked
What's up with her face lol
I made it 47 seconds, cringed, wondered why they in that 47 seconds replayed the same scene 4 times, then wondered how this is considered “country” and assumed it’s cause of the banjo and they repeated things in the song like Dora the Explorer…
Why is she doing country?
Why shw dressed like Kanye's wife lol
Whats up with the serpent over her left eye?  good song tho
I don't know why people say it's a music video while its a music visualizer
How to trigger a boomer
Country??...mmn no..   Do we have to show our chest in everything?🙄
What the hell is the terminator eye about 🤷‍♀️
Do y'all not know what a visualizer is?
Whose backup singer? not Destiny's Child 😅  that ain't  contry, they'll tweak to it 😅😅😅😅
7 of 9?
What the heck?How did they make that over and over
When did beyonce get breast implants They must have gone  sour  after kids and why she mostly naked Was expecting to see some country stuff.Boy was I wrong
How is this not country someone please explain it to me from a musical perspective and do not comment if you don't play any instrument/listen to bluegrass thanks
How do people have clothing on like this, and not have a nip slip? Miley Cyrus was doing crazy wild dancing in the "Flowers" music video, with no nip slip
What do Texans think?? 😂
Wth is she wearing anyways , And god keep her with pop music shes definitely not country 🤦🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️🙅🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
What the hell did I just watch??😂😂 that's a music video? Lawd, we be skimping these days. Or is it lack of imagination now 😅😂
This is what passes for talent?
Isn’t this the same chick that bitched about “cultural appropriation” for the last decade? Oh, but it’s OK to appropriate my culture huh?
Wonder how much the choreographer got paid..🤔
The video doesn't match the song, who is this person, can the real Beyonce come back, this entity has taken possession of her soul
Song doesn't match the video, it's porn why ???  Beyonce where is she? Who is this person? 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 For her, an entity has taken possession of her soul.
Does anyone think this song is a response to sheldon’s radical opinion song called try that in a small town???
How is this allowed?🤭
Producer: how lazy do you want this music video to be?  Beyoncé: yes
Y’all have never seen a visualizer before?
Country? 🤔🤢🤮
tf is this?
Is this really the video for this lame attempt at a country anything? GTFO 😂😂😂😂
The fuck? Same video over every part of the song. 👀💀
Is this not cultural appropriation!? Where’s the outcry? Are they playing Lainey Wilson on BET!? I think not…..
Is this a joke?  That is awful!  Like any true country music fans will embrace this nonsense 🤦🏼‍♀️😂
Lmfao! Wth is this crap?
i wonder how many times it took to get it perfect without her mabambalambas falling out
Is there a complete line dance for this song? I’ve only seen the first part of it. Also why are you half dressed? Not country showing all your stuff. Stay in your lane Beyoncé. Please!!!!!
Why do I always need to see all of her when I see her , put on some clothes damn
If this "Visualizer" is an experiment, it failed. No one wants to see a repeating 9 sec. loop of a video. Even against the backdrop of a decent song.
Are these tanning bed glasses?
This is country? LOL This is awful. But then again anything "country" is just really bad pop music at this point.
Anyone else wonder why Beyonce is singing a song about Texas Hold em?  She obviously does not play the game and it (texas hold em) does not dominate pop culture.  Weird to me.
Wonder how she gonna play them cards when the Feds pullup?
When did Beyoncé become a Borg??
You'd think with that fast song there would be some dancing??
Wait I've heard this music before, oh thats right.....Hey It's Franklin.......
Why do  they  have  her  doing  the  same  thing  over  over
Am I the only one thinking of a sexed up Borg!?
Ever hear of Black Hawk Down?
WTF is this?  Reminds me of the theme song from The Jeffersons or something.  🤣  Same vibe.
Am I going crazy or is this video looped? 😅
Can we just keep turning “The Weekend” songs to country instead?
Who are here in 2024 april?😄🥰
HOW MUCH DID THAT FEW SECONDS COST?!?!?!
Wonder how famous she will be when her husband is exposed as a fudge stabber in the rich black gay men scandal the diddy started
How much tell
So horrible. Who is she in this video a saloon girl in the worst bar in town?
was this written by AI?
So now she's a porn star? What the hell is this supposed to be?
Why did she remake the theme song to Franklin the Turtle?
Is it just me or did she copied the tune of this song from an old song called midnight rider by the allman brothers band and then mixed it and remixed it and made her own
Why do female singers today have to get their baps out? It just cheapens a really good singer and turns the video into a bit of trashy porn. I notice that one of the music channels deemed it necessary to blank out her chest. They must have thought it a bit porny too. As well as that, repeating the same thing again and again is boring. Not to mention the connection with guns. Wrong on all levels!
Nice jugs but song is just idk
Are those rich people making fun of us  or what is this?
Do not by tell me that you don’t do the same old , same old sometimes too?  If only I can go to work and just start, pause, repeat!  And get paid!!! She is a genius!
I want to know the answer to that question to why is she doing the same thing over and over again
Oh the Choreography…… !? They realy couldn’t give an Eff…!?
You'll know the difference between a visualizer and a videoclip?
WHY IS THIS OLD LADY NAKED?
Having Beyoncé doing the same thing is such a lazy editing 😂 and choreography
This is country???  Not! She is taking her style of vulgar singing and dress and attempting to make a "country" genre of a song using her style. Country is not vulgar like her singing.  Never seen Dolly singing like this. She would have to call Jolene a few vulgar names and add a few more foul slurs. This is not country.
Man who the hell even listens to her songs
Is she promoting her song??
What's up with the one eye symbolism
Whats a visulizer? Is it like the loop video you see on Spotify? So artists dont create music videos anymore? N'aww i came here looking for one. This is boring. Songs crap.
How does anyone actually like this song
Is this real? Crap song and crappier video. Pretty sad from someone that used to have talent
WTH the breast exposure?
Isn’t anyone talking about the vest she wearing? 💀
How is this "Country Music"? ...just sounds like another usual Beyonce song
Who got sacrificed for this one ??
Did no one see the chest filter bugging out?
Is there a way to block a song?
can she sing with clothes on?
Where’s her shirt? That’s weird.
Why is she dressed like a stripper ?
Somebody came up with a dance to this, she couldn’t be bothered?
Is this ai or something?
Who's song is that???
I was wondering if she was auditioning to be a stripper because of the way she's dressed in the way she's walking???🤷‍♂️
Why is the left eye covered? Seriously, ummm, the Antichrist, your greatest master or savior, Freemasonry, deviation and control over the world and minds, you people must shun the likes of these devils.
Does she really have do that to be popular?  A little sexy is sexier than all icing and no cake. Yuk.
Nice voice but why can't we make it kid friendly?
is this suppose to be country..?
How do you show that much Boob and no Nipple? 🤔
is it me or is this just another example of a world gone mad long ago here we have 4 minutes video of a half naked beyonce that 26.9+ million pepole in the whole world see..im no expert but something here just aint right to me...
Why do you do it over and over the whole song
Was waiting for the big moment chorus and it just doesnt happen? This is her big single offf this album?? Meh
Why she not dancing🤔
So... are we just going to ignore the illuminati symbolism all over this video? The Serpent covering one eye? The 'As above, so below' hand genatures?... No? Nobody?  😳
This is country? We are doomed,
I wonder how many nip slips there were before they finished the video
i always curious about beyonce tits
THIS is what is No 1?? SERIOUSLY..THIS  IS HER NO 1?
Surely she could do better!
Why She Always Half Naked???
Why is she half naked? 😮
Wtf did I just watch
How is she’s able to wear that outfit on YouTube? She’s practically wearing nothing.
Really? This is shit
Why dose she do the same thing
Where’s the rest of her clothes
What is this crap
Why is she naked?!?!
So this little harmless tune is what everybody is all up in arms about which in turn is what led me here in the first place pondering: is it the lack of depth of the - shall we say "composition" that people take exception to or the fact that it is voiced by a non white artist or maybe both? Either way - seems like ppl have no real problems these days..
Why is she repeating the same thing all the time?? It was just 1 min and I paused the song to think about it
Ok what was that supposed to do?
She's so naked... Why have anything on, if it doesn't cover up anything?
lol I wonder if she wore this outfit to one of the diddy freaky sex parties she and dear old hubby went to over the years...
Why does everything have to be so fucking sexual?
I’m sorry but what was the point of this music video? Please tell me this is not the original.
Ai. Really.... wanna be no 1 in country too?? Why? Wtf??
Wtf is this she thinks shes sexy js bc of not wearing no clothes-
Is this is???  Her music video???
What about the black panther shot out?
Why isn’t this considered trashy?
Why u do the same thing all over again
Wtf has country went to like what happened to George strait or the old possum.
to the guys saying this is a visualizer, the fuck it isnt, this is a goddamn youtube short on repeat
Is that all she has t/a?
Who does she think she is?
Why is she showing her boobs? That is weird!
Since when do we have "official visualizer" instead of "official music videos".
Is this a joke?
Why does this lady always over sexualize her videos?? 😮😒🙄
What was the point of this video, apart from the artist masturbating their ego?
I watched her move the same way for 3 minutes? Uh dahhhhhhhh😅 shiiiiiii I'll watch Nicki not move at all in a music video 😂
And why less clothes? This song doesn't make any sense.
What’s the point of this video lmao
DOES ANYONE FIND THE LYRICS ODD? PERHAPS THINK THE VIDEO IS WEIRD AF!?  NVM. LOL
I wonder how many takes this took lol
So when does she come out with her equivalent of call me by your name?
I'M WONDERING WHY AN AGING ARTIST SUCH AS SHE...WOULD FEEL THE NEED TO GET MOST OF HER TITS OUT...AT THIS STAGE OF HER CAREER... DON'T GET ME WRONG... SHE'S STILL FINE AF!!!!
What is this mess?😂😂😂
What is she trying to do here?  Not a fan
Are people stuipd it is not country
She has the talent to sing and can definitely dance. Is it really necessary to make a music video with so much of an outfit?   Yan, I know it's part of the song, but she becomes like JLo, whose marketing strategy is to show up almost every part of her body.
Can you make another pageant song
What’s with her outfit???  😩Do you have to be 1/2 naked all the time??
This looks p*rn... What is beyonce doing ? Onlyfans ???
What has happened to us as a society that we are no longer offended by videos like this??  I love the song, but all the nudity, sexuality, is not necessary and I can not find how that represens country music at all.  I'm offended and don't see how in the world this video/song became #1!
What is the point of this video?
Why do some female artist feel they have to get half naked to do a video, if the music is good. That's all you need.  This just looks trashy to me.
And she has a daughter???
I wonder wat artist she took this song from 😂 now who wrote this B
2:28 how are you shooting
Why has she got all out 😂 no class
how can this be a hit song 🙂‍↕️
What the hell is this crap?
wonder why she bothered to wear any clothes
Girl where is your budget? Cause there was NONE! 😅
How do you know Texas ?? 😂😂😂
Why is she naked? Especially she's not dancing or dressed or has anything providing evidence of what she's singing about
Doesn’t sound even close to country music!???
Why does a beautiful woman have to dress like this 😢
Why is she half naked?? Real country woman don't do that
I'm not understanding -- can someone explain this to me -- is there a meaning behind the video being on a loop?
what I'm watching? some cheap YT porn?
What is happening? Ran out of idea?
If she has so much talent why does she need to perform half naked? #shameful
Why this woman have to expose her body to prove her talent????? !!!! ????
Er what? Video fail. A better video might have had 100 mill views for star of her magnitude.
Why is she so fat lol 😂
Why does she have to appear half naked? This is not country values if she wants to be a country star
Annoying over and over again....Cool once but not a hundred times. Is there a different vid of this? What am I missing? Good song though  😁
What's the yeehaw agenda? Tf am I listening too ? You made a bunch of black artist who have 0 interest in country music start making weird country pop mixed songs ? Tf is our government up to.
buy why?
why does she look white
Isn't the covered eye a symbol of Horus and the Illuminati?
Are you frickin’ kiddin’ me??! Wth is with the stupid “replay”?? I’m waitin’ for some serious dance moves here. 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
Did they forget the rest of the video? Song ain't bad at all.....but damn.
What are those clothes? Any jeans and tshirt wouldn’t be nicer? The song is very nice reminds me of Shania Twain.
Can someone drop the link for the real video. Thanks
Umm why bother make this video
Does Beyonce not make music videos anymore?
What am I Looking at?  Nah ..  not beyonce being cheap
What is she saying? It’s not relatable to the clip or I call it reel. But I can here last word shot
Is me or it looks fake asf 🤔
What is the point of having a video?
Can someone explain to me why Beyonce looks like she's in a select your character room in the thumbnail. 😂
It's like if you asked AI to write a country song
I am trying to enjoy the rather cool and unusual song, but I seem to be having a hard time doing that.  Was this really necessary?
Is this a comedy song? What a JOKE.
I wonder who they had to kill to get this song.
Why am I nodding and gulping my drink with hand in the air in my office?
Wtf,where is sunshine
What do you call it when beyonce falls on stage....a ho-down!!!  Shes s trashy lady.  Pretty but still a *o
Isn't it strange that it plays everywhere except country radio stations?
Does she always have to put her junk out there?
What’s with the eye thing? Far from country.. Looks more like porn
Who did it better?  Beyonce or BigX?
Why isn't she dancing to this song as so many have?
What does country music got to do with boobs? She is so talented, she does not need to show boobs!
So because she’s singing on a country tune, it’s country? Her voice still skins regular… they gave lil nas x a hard time and his voice actually sounded a bit country
I heard that song on the Radio and was like maaan what the hell is that sh... again?
What did I just watch?   I thought my screen was glitching.   What?  Why on repeat?   I get artistic vision blah blah or maybe I don’t because that was an awful video.
Seriously, WTF is this stupid shit?
What in thee American prostitution is this? 😂😂😂 Featuring Jay-Z & Diddy
Why does  she have to sexualize everything she does?? Is she that insecure ?  Put on some clothes, and do some real singing.
Does she ever country dance in this video?!!!
Is this considered country now? Yikes.. trashy nonsense.
Is she a strip dancer of some sort .? Beautiful woman but not much talent
The question is, whyy even wear one. 😮
Y'all help an  old  lady out and please tell me where the dance that's on every other video I see coming from?  Apparently, it's too long for Beyonce to do, herself.
what is this trash?
How about an Austin Powers remake😊
When did Beyoncé turn into a town girl😶
Are you afraid people will not enjoy your music if you don't sell your body with it???
Wait a minute,  is this the actual video fir this song? If so why do people have an actual dance for the song..
Do we really need the soft porn to enjoy the music?
Is this soft-core porn? I know it's definitely not country music.
Is this the actual video? After the 3rd scene I'm like huh? Has to be the cheapest music video ever made
This is the damn video ? This can’t be it
Why are so many southerners triggered by this song?
Why no top only a vest jacket
anyone else turn the radio off when this comes on?
Why are you covering your eye!!why are you trying to steal the souls of the pure country folk?? They aren’t gonna fall for that!! Whistle all you want. Try that in a small town !!!!✝️🙏🏼❤️
Seriously, is this the official video or is it an April Fool’s joke
I really don't understand she is talented but why does a 42 year old woman need to show her self like this
Fantastic music  love it. No need for her to be half naked.. why? Littke girls love B, so why does she have to dress like this?
Is youtube broken why is this a loop
Where is the video? Is this it?
cool song but is the actual video for it? so not like her……
Is it about country or sex?
Like the song- still Adele never needs to undress to sell. So what is being sold??
Great song love it💯🎶🤟, not sure wtf going on with video, compared to her other songs🤷‍♂️
Horrible. Does she have a mouthful of marbles? Can she perform without over showing her body parts? So over it😮
Can't  sell your song without you boobs exposed?
Not only is this song kinda meh, But like, Why is she naked? This is a bit lazy dontcha think?
Why is the entire video just 1 clip repeating? This is so stupid, the song sux and this video is just 1 clip played over and over , completely idiotic stupid shit
Why? She's so beautiful so why does she need to look like she's in the bedroom?😮
WTF is this shit? Looks like the  start of a porno!
I searched for this song just knowing Ms. Bey would have some cool dance routine to go along with it……. what?!? 🤔
Doesn’t she make enough money to afford a shirt?  They sell them at Walmart for five bucks.
How tf ppl be enjoying this
Why do performers artists now have to constantly look like whores? Ugh
Is she serious  or just throwing lyrics  together and try n make a mockery of texas or  country music  she being foolish with this one here
This is the whole video?? Is this official??
PLEASE DONT RUIN COUNTRY MUSIC...is nothing sacred???
Why she look like a Borg from Star Trek?
I don't get it, what does this visualise?
Now what would JZ think😂
Why is she half naked ?
Lazy lazy video.. Please tell me it is a bad fan edit.
What?!😂
What the hell has Oldham a town near Manchester got to do with Texas ?
Is this a joke? Her vocals & lyrics are nothing country & the beat doesn’t work with her slow vocals. Truly a disgrace & diss song to country. 😢
WTH is she wearing 😂
Why is she half naked? Blacks make everything ratchet wtf
why is it that women as they get older have to try and show that their body hasn't fallen apart yet? Body looks plastic. Not country at all.
Is Beyonce running the Thunderdome now?
What does it mean to have a repeating over and over again? I don't get it.
Is this a music video or onlyfans?
why half-naked? not country
What is this monstrosity?
Why does she have to be naked?
why no belly button
this stripper really can sing...who is she?
Ummmm what's with this video? Surely Beyonce can do better than one scene of finger pistols on repeat for 4 minutes
Wtf? This is horrible 😮
Why does she look like an AI country BOT!
was this a joke or satire?
Can she do country roads?
Where are your clothes woman. And to think you are a role model to millions of people 😢 failed society. Well done
Where is the mouth movement?
I think that video 📸📷 it's sexy 😏 and funny 🤣 What do you think 🤔
Am I the only one that’s beeen seeing all these verizon ads before all Beyoncé songs come on genius marketing skills!
Is this getting air play with the lyrics as they are?
What are you wearing??? Buy a mirror stop letting people tell you you look good. You got money they lie.
Is the video stuck ????? Wth ??? Over n over 🙄😒🙄
so what the hell is this besides a half naked woman
Really?
What is she a borg??
When you ask ChatGPT to write your songs.
What in the world is the point of this being played on loop for the entire song?
Who's noticing that hand signal? ❤
Where has her clothes gone
I wonder if you all are seeing what I'm seeing in this video? Beyoce is slacking in the top ten. I'll tell you why, she's about to bring out a new album, so she's creating some dust.
What's up with the trashy outfit.
Why is that old lady almost naked?
What in the holy hell is this crap 💩
I like country, but what is this?
Oh this is an awful video. Can anyone explain why it’s the same all the way through… over & over again??  What M I missing?
Where is her shirt😂
AND the official video?
How is this good music? Like brub, this isn't even good
Why she is naked? Does she need this?
Wtf is this video 🤢🤮
Bro 😢 is she a girl or boy like WTH
What's country about this song
Is that real? Or I am just dreamming? Is it organiz? You know what I mean….🎉
Where is ur shirt lady?
Why did Jay-Z abandon Rock music?
Who is she
What if the vest falls off
Why does she have to be practically naked?  Love the song but seriously?!
This is considered country? Music video ain't country
What does this video have to do with the song?
First time hearing.. that’s it? Just Beyoncé doing what countless have done before? No innovation?
What video
Is this even called a video??? Waste of our 3mins of our lives watching a 10aec action repeatedly. 😮
Why is she wearing that thing on her face and shooting out of her finger after she fondles herself? She reminds me of the terminator but female .????
Country? Where?
Oldie here…What is on Beyoncé’s face?
What am i watching over and over again?
Anyone else thinks this music video is crap?
What’s with this lame video? Is this the real video? It’s nothing
Is this a joke ?
Um I stopped watching after the 4th time she walked forward and shot from her fingers. Is that the entire video? 🤷‍♀️
What???
That's a video?
Is this the whole video? Lol
Song is great , video not so ? What is the go with the video on repeat - disappointing
Where is the Country in her voice???Still sound R&B/rap
Why????? Absolutely not her best video!!!!
Fan fact: MTV censored her breasts cleavage although nothing explicit is shown. WTF?
Why is the playlist all out of whack?
Is that all she does!? 😮
Was B always this white 🤍
why is "my house" not on the album???
Why do all these songs sound like they were recorded with technology of the seventies 😂
HOW THE HELL IS POSSIBLE ONLY 25MILL VIEWS???!!!!!!
How is this country!!
Um no. Seriously?
So, is the actual video? If so, where is the rest of it?
Whats with all the one eye symbolism
Who’s here 2025?
Why do women always have to appear naked?
why so little clothing.
Who is listening to the entire album without skipping
Who let her make this terrible song?
Is she trying to follow Taylor Swift's success ? 🤣
I love her but why in the world would you look like this. Why show so much of yourself, these are your private parts. Nobody can touch them, but’s aloud to show them? Young girls will also look that way en boy’s look at her  sexually. Is that intentionally? I think I don’t understand.
Did she just copy the intro from Semsi Yastiman- Uzaylilar Hos Geldiniz?
Could we maybe have something different for a video. Lowest budget video ever
Does she have to be pornographic to sell a great sound?
Are we this desperate for a new song or music??? Im not lol
Who’s here from TikTok?
Why so much nudity
Who is here after the album???
Can you do one song without your titties hanging out
is this soft porn?
Is this a Lexus advert
Is there any genre can't fit in? She's MUSIC!!!
Bruh what’s under that jacket no shirt lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😳😳😳💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
what if this was made by ai
What in the country sh*t is this???
Who’s ready for tonight? ❤❤
She wants to be a role model for women but not sure the outfit fits that image..its 2024... why still the need so be semi naked to sell a record? Men generally dont do this...its like going back in time...If the record is good it will sell.
nice country song, shania twain?
I can’t believe that’s what she’s wearing what kind of example is that
who is ready for Tomorrow cowboy carter album 🎉?
Why dress always naked😢
Why does she need to not wear a shirt!  Great song but video 🤬🤬🤬
You are a good dancer.  Why make this with this song? is so dancing song
I wonder if he was respectful to them young crying girls
I hear Louisiana by Reyna... Was this inspired by that song?
Ummm,,'... I was looking for a line dance to go with this.
This song is a good song   Nice tempo everything you like So why all the  problem with it
big question is will she ever stop doing bukkakes?
She looks like a porn star!!! Why?
Where's the Beyoncé clip?
That's it for the video? What happened, Is she broke Or just stopped trying?
I was expecting a video. It's just a loop of her walking?
Who reported for sexual content?
What’s her problem ?
Can't she put some underwears like any standard singer????😢
Damn is there any black music artists not in the cult? No wonder why none of them build anything for the black community
WTH, is this?
I wonder whose idea was this that she has to be half naked she’s beautiful she might as well just start posing for Playboy, but I guarantee she was made to do it like that
Whats with this video?
Whoelse is ready for act ii COWBOY CARTER🤩
That’s the video? Why the fuck is she so full of her self 💀💀💀
I like the song but why is the video repeating the same overly weird and sexualized thing over and over and over again? YUCK!!!
But why?
Isn’t that cultural appropriation?
WTH was this? Like a bad acid trip dang!
Were is the video  with her singing  it ?
Who is listening to this song in 2027
THIS ISN'T COUNTRY THIS IS HIPHOP BEATS AND ITS JUST AN AI NOT A REAL VIDEO WTH?
Why do these stars always have to be practically naked to perform… corrupting young people once again with another genre! The song is horrible and not country … just another pop sound for money!
A woman in her 40’s and a mother of 3 can still dress this way for the public?   Ok, her body her choice!  Cheers to the young generation 😢
Was this Beyoncé idea or the people creating the video because I swear she is doing the same thing over and over for 4 minutes.
I love Bey but for the life of me I don't understand why the beyhive Don't be going after Jay-Z Epstein??
Why is she wearing her panty hose backwards?
Why the same moves every time
I don't get this, why she trying country? she's RNB and this is sooooooo far from what she's known and loved for! Don't like it 😕
I wonder how many takes this took because the jacket fell off
I didn't know that beyoncé made the song but why do she don't have on a bra or a shirt
Is this all the video is? Just Queen B walking up half naked, with fake hand gun finger that "Kapow" like a pop gun? Kinda disappointed B!
tell me why it took so long to realize that she was just doing that the hole time 😂❤   But she slays in that coat.
Lame, what’s next, death metal?
Where is the pole she can swing on?
Tell me why she’s basically just wearing a coat
Can some one please explain the lyrics ? Because I dont understand de meaning behind. Whats the thought ?
Why are you starting again again and again
Not sure with the breast out like that, not sure that is  setting a good example for children or young people.
Why does she sound like Shakira a little bit
dirty texan music with nudes wtf @beyonce
Also this video sucks wtf did they use just a ai clipnreal quick so they could work in secret still on a Terminator beyonde video
Great song, but why the boring video?
Is this the music video? Songs ok videos crap, she getting a bit like Madonna ...we've seen it all before love , put it away and have some class
What kind of stupid video is this?
Why  Boobs showing
... is this actually the video?
Why she keep doing that???????
So.... the whole clip is her on repeat doing the same shit? 😬
Is it just me who's heard the first part of this song before?!?!? I feel like I'm going mad.
What the fuck is this shit
Can she cover up? Kids see this.
Why?!?!?
Why is she PREDICTABLY half naked in a Goofy Costume .. . .    again ?
Sounds like cultural appropriation to me, but if a white person wears dreads black cry about it. Which is Nordic.
Tell me how many dislikes this song got for YouTube that be great how about that YouTube?😂😂😂Lol Big joke, not country almost gospel in a way sad to hear. Ruined my day.
What the hell is this clip? ☹️
Why she only making country music am not hating just asking
No cus why is this actually good 😭😭
what kind of nonsense video is that?
Wtf is this
Who’s listening this song in 2030???
Cant decide which is worse, the song or the video
Seriously?
...how you make extreme money with an old song and no video on YT, ask Beyonce.
Hmm... seems more like Franklin theme song (2000) to me😂 Just a bit more sped up, with different lyrics😂
Can she just sing without showing her ass or boobs?
Is there only one way to keep people’s attention, through nudity?
Franklin theme song best or what?! 😂
So is there a real video to this song or just the repeat weird thing?
Is this video just her walking with her boobs showing & her playing with herself?
Have we mentioned another issue related to Taylor Swift yet? Complete change of genre? TAylor wins and we have to listen to jz whine about how unfair the world is... if you can't beat them,  join them...WOO-WOO-WOO
She deff forgot about dre .. what in the white girl is this 🫣    june carter ... Where is Jonny 🤣😎🤣
Did A.I. write this song? Cuz.... Yeah just seems like a terrible attempt to appropriate country culture.
Was it the Choreographer’s day off?  Seriously disappointed!  👎🏼
Why does she need to show her boobs in the video? It looks ridiculous.
Why's she gotta look like a hoe, beautiful voice. Catchy song but c'mon girl 🤠 this looks like an Austin Power's movie clip.  Still love the tune
Love the dong, video is daft, why didn't she dress country and do the dance
so no-one says anything about 'cultural appropriation'?  is it because no-one cares about cultural appropriation anymore? or that no-one dare say anything because it's beyonce, a sacred cow if ever there was....?
is it just me or i saw texas hold em in a gambling site and i googled it.
If we could really see the number of dislikes  👇🏽
Texas hold em immigrants?
Who is listening this song in 2024
Ok, so where did the dance for this song come from cause she just profiling 😮
Ok, how many times did she shoot her finger gun? I think I’m tripping out because of this- she didn’t do anything else. I’m so confused. lol
Whats on her eye????
Why she like to show her assets to people? Her children are watching mommy go naked.... 😢😢😢😢😢
I just wanna know why Texas Hold'em is linked to the video when the song is Rose's turn, but sounds like the Kurt version from Glee
And people call this piece of shit song country? I’m disappointed.
I wonder how much she paid Blanco Brown for this because it’s clearly The Git Up song. I love what she did with it tho
How many pro-blacks are pretending they like this hot garbage because they feel they have to in order to be pro-black, and how many white liberals are doing the same thing in order to be inclusive and anti racist? Because I don't believe anyone actually thinks this is good music.
For those who’s wondering why this video is a 10 seconds repeated clip because it’s visualizer and the music video is yet to come
im confused
Is it country because of the fiddle and Banjo? If you replace that you can get a normal pop song out of it… the lyrics dont even do it. The end is straight pop. Maybe i am just confused. Add a folk guitar, take out some instruments it is folk. Hey take out fiddle and banjo,  add bells and its a christmas song, with texas lyrics. Just because you name it a certain music style it is not automatically. There is no country feeling and no country attitude in this siong and im not american and see and feel that. Btw song is ok as pop..
March 22nd anyone?
Am I supposed to like this just because she is Beyonce?
Who's this?
Why does she have to be half naked to make this song?
Why is the video just a repeat of tits mgee? Had a minor in the room when I started this
I have nothing against the song, but the outfit …really?
What would make it better if she would open her jacket just a bit more 😂
What is the point of this video? Half naked... dissapointing
Why is she white and hates whites?
What IS this ???
I don't get this Video. If this is a Country Song, why is she dressed this way😮 Where her Cowboy Hat 🤠 & Boots 👢 👢and why not wear something a bit leaning towards Country Music Fashion. Instead she is wearing a Leather & Stocking Crotch Outfit exposing some of her boobs & belly & the Video just doing the same old thing over & over, like they just threw it together, how boring😮 and are they eventually gonna remove her from the Country Music Charts like they did Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus' Song, "Old Town Road" & Billy Ray Cyrus is a Country Singer! I don't know about this Career Move
What type of video is this?  Just weird, although I really like the song and Beyonce's music.
Is she making FUN of country? I heard she had a country song, thought I’d check it out! Didn’t even listen all the way thru, had to turn it off
is this video AI generated?
What’s the point of the repeat video?
Where’s her shirt…
Do not get thai clip ??? What hell going on
Why is she half naked?..
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE THIS ? You must choose good words... example for Kids for youngs  what you teach people? I HOPE GOD OPEN YOU R MIND AND HEART.AMEN
What????
Honestly what is the appeal? Additionally, the looping video doesn't even make sense.
Why she doesn't want to release a videclip for her singles? Bow down this new concept, we want a video!
OK so it’s country music? Why in the hell is she wearing that? Can she be more country outside on the outcry not hip-hop we don’t need another bullshit.
Anyone else think their turn signal is on when this song comes on in a Dodge?  There's a woodblock during the verse that sounds exactly like the clicking from your dashboard..
Whats this music called
Why is she naked and cussing in the song? Tacky.
What's the point of even wearing the jacket?? LOL
The f*** is this?  a cyborg
I like the song and the beat to it, but honestly are some of those curse words "really" necessary for the song ?  🙄🙄
Why is this a country song? because it has a guitar and a clap beat? This aint country 😂
She doesn't need the jacket. My question is, why the jacket??
It's a very nice pop song.  If she can come up with something better (and with more soul) I may be able to consider it decent country music.
Okay I don't get the outfit, why is every singer as they age need to show more of their flesh are they that insecure?   A era of don't subjectify me, but YET?
So... is country popular now or something?
Bro what is that outfit
Why is it just the same thing over and over
You come out in some lingerie and shoot a pistol? What kind of video is that who er?
I dont know why, and never will know: why married woman, having two children shows her boobs🤷🏻‍♀️
what's with this video - its got to the worst?!!
Why u think u have to show ur body
Well not sure what to say about this one.
This song is amazing. But I don't understand why she has to be half naked to sing it?
Why that vest??
Is it over yet
How does she get her nipples to not slip out?😶
Is this the video..... I was expecting a bit more
Didn’t she used to be black?
Where's T-Pain country songs?
I don't see the cowgirl outfit... Where are her boots? However, I really like the song!
Wait. THIS is her video for this popular song? Good Grief!
Is that all she does in the video 😂😂😂😂😂
Why she have to pretend to be a porn star for a music video
She got really fat ..WOw why ..now her legs are so fat ..
Why is she dressed like that? Looks like she's trying to sell sex than music.  Uncalled for.
So, she got so poor, that she had to use the same short clip, to make an entire video?
Ok but what is up with the nearly naked outfit. Not a good look bounce😂
Wtf is she wearing
She doesn't seem to have a nipple does she?
Anyone think she's a spurs fan 3:23
Where’s your boots and clothes?
Is this the official video...( Jeeze at least Madonna had a proper video when she went country )
why is beyonces version of country giving adele so hard
Nice throwaway tune.  Seriously, she could not afford a decent writer(s) and video director?  The video looks like that dancing baby screensaver.
Why is this not cultural appropriation? Because she's black and black people can get away with fucking anything!!
is this video just looping all the time?
Why almost  naked  it s for a western or a en erotic movie🤭🤔🤣
Where's the country in this song? Just sounds like another pop song trying to pretend to be country.
who else is 2 stepping
She doesn’t have nipples?!!😮
Man you ask Franklin for this sample
Is that how Texas women’s dress up?😏😏 looks too cheap.
Expected to see western outfits and a row of dancers. WTF is this?
And the point is what?
let me ask all of you fans.... watch halo video and then see this garbage ... you can see it...  u can see the difference .
Just 19 mil views??? It should have ten times that.
What the hell? Hollywood is so weak now.
Why is she hafe naked
Why does this sound like that song i don't play video games no more😊
Why is Beyoncé just like that?
I wonder who wrote her song for her or stolen it 😅. I am back so far I search it lol it says "Nathan Ferraro", helped her for this song
Love the song, is this the real video?
Its kinda catchy, whats the beef with that song ?
What the fuck why is she not wearing a shirt?
This is the best the producers could do with the video? Repeat the same stupid pose?
Where is the video of her actually dancing?
What the hell is this video supposed to be is she a futuristic time traveler who plays shitty attempts at country music
Sooo we are just watching her walk and rub her hand up herself and imitate a gun?  For real?    I would expect more.
Why does she think she have to half naked?
Why is nobody noticing what she is wearing ,like just put some clothes 🤣💀💀
First of all, why half naked?  It's a great song but not sung by her.  Can't she just disappear?
Why do we have to be subjected to nudity
Why are these satanic signs again?
what is that music video so annoying song
What the hell is this crap is people running out of ideas.
Man where the real video
Why is the video on repeat?
Does she not know list is a sin? I’d be so embarrassed to show my body off to the world like this. Her husband and children should be embarrassed of her. Have some class for your body.
Is it important to show them body in them songs??
Not sure about this one Queen B it's sounds like a red neck cracker tune
black women want respect, yet their 'queen' always try's to show all she possibly can? What happened to talent without being naked?
Just why? 🤦🏻‍♀️
What’s with this repetitive move? It’s annoying
I wonder why nobody talks about all her nips and tucks she don had a ton of surgery I'm sure
What is this….. a thirst trap where is the music video
Surely you have a big enough budget to do more than repeat the same scene over and over again.
It's a good song, but why does a body have to be nekkid 😅
Where's the video
....that beat ....so familiar....FRANKLIN??? https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared
Has anyone noticed that the vid is a repeating feed?  Just saying.
This is a pop song with a country sample??? 😂😂😂😂. This shit sucks
This is a cute litle diddy, and it's highly catchy. I can't stop singing parrs of it randomly, for zero reason, lol. I do wonder something, though: why bey always gotta have her t#tties, booty, crotch skin in vid? This was a vid of her boobies bouncing on loop. :/   i don't get it. She's gorgeous w or wout makeup, and i think that she's most beautiful w natural hair and street clothes on.
Is tht all the video???
Why not just remove everything 😂
what the hell is this sex sells not the music
Wtf is she wearing.. 🤢😱🙈
WTH did her get up have to do with this song.  Just icky.
Why is she naked??
Beyonce trying to get uncancelled with some country half naked ? Her handler is really pushing it these days
What the hell is this shit because this is more like a rap and a strip show but y'all want to consider this Beyonce's country music  😂😂 she should really stay at what she's doing good at and countries not it
You call this country music? I call it crap thats just a repeat over and over and over.
Who's here from TikTok before this was removed from sounds
Country?  My ass!! Shameful!!
Is this cultural appropriation?
why making yourself so low??
“Official Video” why on earth waste time and resources for a constant loop of visual?
I don't get the song because she says this aint texas but is a texas song ? It is  catchy
What is happening?? Please make it stop and go away
If nylon hair is the new thing, just let me know
Why is it a short clip on repeat?
Where is her shirt?👕
Why's she got her baps out?  Lazy choreography and insulting to fans.
What is the main thought of this song ? I done get it at all  I cant tell what it is about even if I try …
Why always naked?
Sound is good but the video, I am sorry but it feels wrong because I love country artist and their appeal, style and class what message is the video trying to convey? It sits wrong on me. Now I get it my girl can do this and I look forward to her toning a few things down to give a message outside of she is competing with Taylor. Sexy and classy is not coerced with tits, butts let’s leave some of our heritage in the cultures we were born in . The belated Whitney Houston thank u for supporting the country sound in a way everyone can say ok.
Is this supposed to be country music? Hank Williams Sr and Merle Haggard are rolling over in their graves, this is pathetic.
How is this allowed
The song is fine. WTF is up with the half naked outfit? She looks ridiculous.
I wonder if she's wearing a bra 😂😂
Is this the official video?
3:17 Star Light Zone? lol
How tf is this country?
What the hell is happening
That doesn’t sound. Country.
Wtf is this video
I'm confused. 😂
No offense great song WHERE IS THE BRA
What makes this country?
Who made the song? It is a hit
Cant just fucking call it a video?
Beautiful song, not feeling the wardrobe.  Normally I love her outfits
Why do her boobs have to be the main attraction??? Seriously
Lol, whats this?
I just wanna know why is the same clip playing over and over again
If my dad heard this, God rest his soul, he would be say... "What is this????"  .  I grew up with my dad playing old school country artist.  He would definitely say "this isn't it."
Country?
When is the Music Video release!?
Where's her clothes😂
Alright dude what the flip
Is Beyonce trying to be white singing g country music?
This is literally trash. Why is Beyonce doing country now? She cant do country, it doesnt even sound right. But because shes Beyonce every one thinks its amazing.
Beautiful lady, great voice. Why does she have to dress like a call girl?
Who came from TikTok? 😊
How is this a country song?
Good song cuz she is a great artist. America debating if this is country is hilarious. Just cuz it has horses, leather, acoustic guitar and mentioned Texas doesn't make it country. It has also not brought to light having black representation in country. Kane Brown has been doing for a while and Darius Rucker even longer. No hate but this is easily a pr play
Is that all it takes to make a video, walk out on stage half clothed, never say a word, and do it over and over and over again??? 😮
If her music is sooooo good why does she have to jiggle her boobies and be half naked for attention? Have some class girly!
WTF is going on with our world !?!
Is this the real video?
was she styled by Kanye? Or did she just forget to get dressed?
Why can't we get more action in this video
Can't she at least put a shirt on??
She's getting older May be she only got that one move left?
What the hell is this? We're the rest of the video is a loop, definitely she didn't put a lot of tough on the lyrics as long they were rhyme she was ok 😅
Does not sound country. What's happening
Why is the video stuck??
As a Texan MAN IDK HOW TO FEEL ABT THIS 😭
How many tries did it take to get the shot of her walking without Uhm.. something to be seen?
Why kind of shit is this song?????😢😢😢😢😢😢😫😫😭😭😭😭😭
Is this even considered a video of A list artist's?  Probably voice manipulated
Love the song, the arrangement, the harmonies, her talent and voice- but WHY this raunchy get-up????
I don't get it!! What's this style video got to do with the song? Might as well just have made it a cover video. I don't want to watch Beyone half naked, I want to see what the lyrics mean by showcasing it visually 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
So Miley Cyrus and Beyonce switched roles? 😅
Any one else just see her doing  the same walk and stuff
Is this it? The video? Really? I was soooo impressed with the song. Was going to post my appreciation until I saw this. Wtf🤷‍♀️ Is this the entire video or is it some sort of preview thing?????  Ok!!!! Update, phew, yes this is basically a preview promo. Jesus lol.
Question?in Texas do they walk around like that with their breasts uncovered?
how much is tiffanys etc?80,000$?
This is the worst supposed music video ever!  Is this supposed  to be talent?
Bayou influences and sounds. This is not southern country why is people mad and if it was still why?
Does she got to go naked to sell this album?
Wtf did I just watch
I don't understand why she doesn't wear close my mom use to say honey leave something to the Imagination .she is beautiful she dose not have to look so cheep
Is she making fun of country music? Or is she serious?
The song is good but why is she dressed in bin liners? Dressed may be a strong word here.
So without the naked body nobody going to listen?  No need for this, I want see her dancing l like others on yt, this corny an cheap looking.  Tune catchy tho.
TF is this?
Wtf is this video🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Isn’t she almost 50?
What's an official visualizer?
What in the actual fuck is this nonsense?
Wait this can't be her video!
I just want to know how does she feel about her daughter and son seeing her mom's boobs like this not really a  role model put some clothes on you've got a great voice why do you think you have to be naked to sell music ?
Is it Pop Music or Porn?
I’m confused. This is the same scene over and over? Maybe this isn’t the original video?
Is that the whole video? Just the same clip over and over?
You know, the more you cover the more men and women have to have the mystery of a women's figure. Not that you look bad but the video is <_< really? Why not do different outfits at least instead of just one same... idk. I'm a 24F btw.
Am I the only one who actually enjoys this song? 😂
What the hell is this video?!
Is this really supposed to be country??
What color is her shoes
Why is she dressed like a P....Star ??? 🤦‍♀
Wtf why she's nude
WTH? Did she lose a bet or something?
So Beyoncé basically wrote the lyrics like her usual type of songs but just made a “country” melody and sang it in a “country” tone?
She really be lookin like the main villain of Power Rangers Time Force.
What the actual hell is this?
Director: how much money do you want to spent on the music video?  Beyonce: about 30 dollars tops😂
How about no?
OMG WHY DIDNT SHE BEEP OUT THE CUSS WORDS
Should I report this cuz I just wanted to listen to music but then I saw this?
Fellas, what colour was the song
What rubbish she wearing???
The song is great.... but is that the official video??
How is this the video? Wtf??!
So it's okay when they culturally appropriate?
What the heck is with being half naked?!? 🙄
Is this music video broken 😢
This is music? 💩💩💩💩
Why do we have to make trash out of everything!
This is the Franklin the Turtle theme song. Wtf is she doing??
Why is she dressed like that though?
Is that it just her walking forward and then again and again what a shit video
Franklin Theme Song?
What are you communicating Beyon? Their  other Platforms for this type of content or sensual expression.
What does her dressing half naked have anything to do to with this song
how did this beat so many good songs for #1 on hot100
Why did This song blow up?
What happens to the clothes some one need to donate her a dress to cover her body😢the body reveal is unnecessary with such a good voices. Very sexualizeeed
What is she wearing?
why is she half naked
What happened to being classy
Am I the only one who thinks most of these songs are being written by AI? 😂
This is country?
So did someone get paid to choreogragh this mess? I was hoping she actually danced.  Could have had a cute dance to go along with it...
Wtf  is this
What is she actually doing?! Phone it in huh?
I wanted how many walks it took for her nipples not to show
Is there an actual need or reason to dress like this for a "country song"?! Anybody realize how this is a literal rip off of the Franklin Turtle theme song from the cartoon?! It's not even original...jeezus....🙄🙄
Is this the actual video?
Great song but why the porn video?. Just was not necessary.
Is it just me or are main stream music videos getting lazier and lazier every year?
Did Nvidia get a share for the physics of the "pair"?
what was the song' orijinal version? I can't remember.. Adele?
For years and years I've been asking myself: Why do women have to be naked all the time when they're selling their song?
Whos think taylor is better?
But why is she dressed like that, TRYING to sing country?
Why you trying to sound like Rising Appalachia?
Was that it, WTF
Are we sure this is country?😮
Is this someone’s Only Fans account? LOL
She doesn’t have to dress like this to sale music. Her singing talent alone would have sold millions. Why does she have to be half naked to advertise her first country song?
Who's 60 years old after spending 30 years?😅
She looks AMAZING, BUT, how much do you want to bet that this is A.I.?!?😮😊😮 You NEVER KNOW😅😅😅
This is not country...and she's naked and wth did I just watch? This is so bad
:30 seconds in… what the hell?
What Country singer dress like this?
That's the best film clip she can come up with???
I’m obsessed with song but don’t get video? Is it same thing over and over again?
This is horrible wtf Beyoncé and Taylor Swift switch genres or what?
wtf kinda video is this? a 7 second scene on repeat for 3.57 minutes.... cmonnnnnnnnnn
Is this all she doing in this. Video???? No line dance???? I like the song, but the video is lame! 😮😢
Just hopping on the band wagon much? ❤have your own style
Is that it? That's the video? Is this a joke? ...
The tune kept me patting my foot. Not sure what genre should claim it, and I’m not certain it matters.  Beyoncé is a an established entertainer, I just wish she would not always feel the need to undress.
How is this country again ?
Whats up the 10 second loop?
Sounds like a country song to me....I wonder if the radio station that refuses to play it saw the video first?
Is this shit supposed to be like country music or something?… what a shame.
Are watching the same clip over and over again what the heck
Wtf is this shit
i heard better country music...and why does she needs to be dressed like this...half naked?
Is this a video?  Ok if it is, then it sucks!  🤮🤮🤮
WTF is country about this repetitive BULLSHIT
Why dit they make here do the same thing the hol time
Why is her skin white now?
Why is it a,lazy video production? You've made countless dance moves fir other songs
What's with the strange outfit? I am very curious to know how she will like on the back of a horse.
Bro what tf is this shit
Is this the real video?
Does she have to show so much skin to feel good? She is over rated.
Where's Timberlake at?
What the fuck is she pulling her 2 fingers out and you can see fiear coming from her fingers so angie what the fuck is shite
but why is she half naked???  if your confident n know you have a good voice n song then why???
What’s with the g string and boos? I love your music but why do you need that look? Is it a comment on Ai?
If em is a culture vulture what does this make her? There nothing whiter then country music. Lmao jk I love country but this isnt it
Where it the video for this song? Is she coming out w a whole EP of this album???
Why is this just her repeating doing the same thing over and over. This must have took a lot of thought 🤣
is this how to scam on yt lol? the blur around his face filter lmao?
Don't get the video. Hä?
Is Beyoncé from Texas?
People arguing if it's country or not lmao it's just a song
So why is it that MGK made a pop punk album and he was vilified and everyone said he was "changing genres" but Beyonce can make a "country-esque" song and she's not switching genres and this song is blowing up on Tiktok..... Um... Double standards in Hollywood much?
Boring video , and why does she want everyone to see a fake boobs???
What is this video?
What husband woud EVER let his wife do this in public?  She is a mother.
Why is it necessary that she is naked? What on earth.
What is the purpose of sexualizing the song, cover up, it's not about you, it's about music.
Boy how did she master all those dance moves
Do you even have a bra on? Ewwww
What is this trash 😅😂😂
No man this music video is soo stupid... is this all she does the whole video through?
What's up with this music video? That was weird
Where's her belly button? Body suit I guess
I have always liked her voice but why the profanity?
Great song but why is she running around  half naked? She has some real talent and doesn’t need her b….s to sell her music.
What is she selling here, music or a prelude to a pole dance? catchy tune, but why do all hip-hop r&b artist's have to interject curse words, or do they just have a limited vocabulary, the latter i guess. I admire her talent as singer, not her music choice, nor do I care to see her skin. I guessing her private life is also filled low morals.
She allergic to clothes? 😒
Is this a porn or a music video about texas I'm confused
did Taylor Swift write this? Or is it suppose to sound like a Swift song???
Sorry for the silly question, but can someone tell me why she has her boobies out?
Is this her song 😂😂😂😂
Why so many haters? I love her, and I love the song.
I think the song is ok...she has always had a good voice...but I think the outfit is unnecessary and over the top....unless looking for some attention...if the song is good and the talent is there...why is this necessary?
This ain’t Texas? If not,  where is it?😂
Where's her clothes. That's not a country outfit.
Isn't this the theme rhythm to that Franklin turtle cartoon?
7 of 9?
Nice song, but why does she look like a Borg?
Beyoncé what is this
Don’t understand the dress code
Do we really need to see her "boobs" seems they run out of Idee
Is this the official video?
If this is not naked then what is? Perveyoncé
🤔 2+2=4 what is Beyonce+Miley=puppet's on a string ....
Horrible, wtf?
Seriously why is she almost naked!! Omg seriously
Ummm…. What?
Omg I love this song so much but why is she just shooting a fake gun for like the whole video? 😂lol
Why is she singing over the intro song to "Franklin the Turtle".
I would love for her to not dress so un revealing. I wonder will she ever grow out of this.
How is this beating carnival
What’s with the Cyborg head gear?? What are they trying to desensitize us to now??   Google: Clone Aid Canada. And Saudi Arabia gives citizenship to a female ROBOT. Hollyweird always shows us what’s coming via “entertainment” (google the Latin meaning of that too)
Hmm love the song, but the video,  What the actual!!!!!
😤😤😤😤😤 does she need fabric donation? Seems she needs one
So are these artificial intelligence visualizers replacing actual music videos? Looks like something went wrong the imagery is stuck  on repeat
Terrible video. WTF IS THE POINT?
why dont she do awesone videoclips anymore??? Only some shitty visualisers???
Am I the only person who thinks she has litterally NO shirts in her wardrobe 😤
Is this the real video
Is that seriously the best they could do visually?  I was hearing the song elsewhere and liked it but this weird visual ruined it for me.
When is she going to do her own dance ⁉️🤷 because the pictures are not we are looking for from her she can show her body on stage at her concerts, ok like she has always done 👍 come on Bey be nice girlfriend🤷 👍🫶🤩❤
If white rappers are culture vultures for doing hip hop then is she a culture vulture 2 ?
Why do all these ladies always have to be half naked, is the visual to distract? Also this is not country...its more like bluegrass gospel.
Is there an actual video or is it just this intro clip? Kind of dig Beyoncé with a country feel.
Why is she naked?
Did anyone see the Gracie’s corner remix😂😂😂😂
B going Taylor and Taylor going B what is this shift😮
If I say I won't listen to her any longer what does that actually mean to a wife of a billionaire, also she's worth more money in a few minutes than most will make in a lifetime
What is a visualizer??? I’m so confused 😂💀
Why does this song sound like something prisoners would sing while digging a trench with prison guards on horseback holding  rifles waiting for someone to take off running...lol
Am I the only one that noticed her shirt
Does she have to have her fake boobs on show ? Kinda ruins the song
WTAF is a "visualizer"? How boring.
Why are you ripping off a child's tv show? And why are you half naked? Doesn't anyone have common decency anymore?
I love the song but escuse me what's the point of the video repeating over and over again I imagine it different
it's a one paragraph song? there is no lyric.. so if it's not texas what is it?
Um these visualizers tho? I don't really get it. The song is a beat all day!
Is this a video???? Country music????
How do her tits look so incredible lol
Can real boobs look like this without support? They are looking like balloons. 🤔
Who tf approved this music video??? Does not go with the music at all...
What is on her face?
Catchy tune. BUT what oh what is she wearing? That's a real cheap look with too much skinshow. Totally unnecessary.
has she ever made a good song since the pink panther song?
As talented as this woman is why does she always have to be half naked in videos??     Ohhh-💡  ….to get the country’s boys to watch.  I think it’s pitiful that they can’t let her song be enough.
How the hell is this considered country music??? Wtf happened to this world
Why she sound just like Sara Evans?
I like the song 🎵 Question... where are her clothes?
Why is she dressing like Kanyes wife?
What does it have to do with her fake breast ?
Why does she keep doing the same thing over and over again??? This is actually the dumbest thing I have ever seen!! You are not country but nice try! Stick with what you know
Is this the video????
WTF does this video have to do with anything?
Why does She have to be half naked all the time🙄
Wth is this??? No no
So much talent. Why does she have to be naked?
Is she supposed to be the terminator?
For yall complaining about the short visual replaying, isnt this better than just words on the screen?  She cant make anyone happy!
Why does she look like a cyborg?? THIS is NOT. Country!!!
Why doesn’t this itch stay in her lane..no one wants to see her do this
Beyonce gained what 50 pounds and whats up with this low budget video ?
Are we all gonna ignore the eye candy?
What is this... The Voices are getting louder... This is everywhere... This is enough make it stop... It haunts me it doesn't want to leave...  Why is my shorts filled with these... Shorts, tik tok, you made me come here... Make this pain end...
As a Texan, what in the fuck is this
Where did the trend dance on tiktok came from then!
Is not her body the upper is more white of rest
Is she forgetting that children look at her? So sad.
Bro where’s her shirt and pants😮she’s have naked
Why is nobody talking about the fact that there is only one shot that is been repeated throughout the video
How is this not cultural appropriation?  I know Beyoncé and Jay Z are RACISTS but where’s the outcry from the public?
Wtf is this piece of shit?
Did she go to country because Taylor Swift came back to pop? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Did she really rip off the Franklin theme song
Confused why we did the same dance moves the whole time
Wow,  gee. Hard to figure out the symbolism behind this get up.   Hmm I WONDER what one eyed covered by a snake could mean? 😅
Ain't her breast suppose to be saggy at her age? Jay Z mess with it so many times in so many years it suppose to be saggy at this point. Since they're rich they must of been inflated for videos purposes.
When am I going to get some support 😪
Very porn?
Aren't you embarrassed for listening to such crap?
This song is a bit repetitive, showing unneccessary skin, and a bit confusing.  I say confusing because of the title. Could someone help me understand? (I am geniunely asking and hoping to get an snwer.)
Why is the video just her doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?
Wth is a visualizer
Why do they have her doing the same thing over and over ?
What is going on
What is this garbage video? Nice mask.
I dunno… I liked her clips better when she took time to hire a choreographer an’ all… 🤭💋
How is she white now?
Is anyone else noticing that the music video is strange and slight inappropriate
Is this really a something???
How the fuck is this country?
WTF is this garbage?!
What the fuck is this video? It looks wrong... So wrong. So ..... I hate this industry. Despise it. Despise them all.
the fuck is this video? lmfao
LMFAO! Is this a joke?  How does dressing like a hooker and singing awful make this a country song.  You can throw this crap over into the R&B section. 😂😂😂
Can't tell what is worse, the song or the "music video"
Am country music fan but this one lacks village style idk 🤷‍♀️
Why is she half naked.
Really is there a reason why she is almost naked just to try to promote a song it's really bad when artists do this just to gain attention
Cool. Good to see her still jamming but where did her clothes go? Gaaawd Lee 😂
Why does everybody like her? I don't know why
How long does it take for me to get my health fixed? I know you have not got multiple billions to fix me up but you celebrities might have to do a Poole to help me out for once
😳wtf did I just watch
Is it just me or did the same clip keep coming the whole time? Love the song tho
Why is this song the same as Franklin the Turtle?
What is a visualiser ? If it is an ai generated video , it could have done much better , not that Beyoncé’s producers have a budget constraints . The song gets a thumb up though , easy on the ears ?
Huh? Beyonće doing a country-ish song. How about that? I like it, though. It's actually my first time hearing/listening to it ❤
Wtf???😂😂😂😂
Is Blue Ivy ok.  That’s all I care about right now. Thank you
Black people are so offended about Elvis apparently stealing black music ….. but they will ignore this ….?
Some please tell me why why why why people are so upset about this song lol. Fucking children
Great song, but why all the nudity???
God help us when will this craze end
I just don't get why she's walking around half naked
The song is good, but why is she just standing there in the music video?
What does her outfit have to do with tax?
Why did she mention a Lexus? Texas is known for American made trucks state
Love Beyoncé love the song …….. but seriously is it necessary to show so much cleavage, Beyoncé doesn’t need to be doing that …
Copying a kids show theme how low can you go.  Franklin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqyE-lWqCE
Da funk is this shiz?
Why she doesn’t do music videos for her songs anymore? It’s extremely bizarre
Practicing a challenge here 🤣🤣
What is this video???
this is not country! give me a break!?
How am i the only one that sees it’s her walking and then a repeat of that over and over again? How is this impressive ?
Why is beonce singing a country song?
Franklin the Turtle?
Love the dress up or lack of it......but why?❤
Haha this is Country?  Nope. I guess Country Pop just went non-Country.  Both songs are not Country.
What kind of video is this?  Is she sending a signal? I’m totally baffled.
Why can't Beyonce wear some decent clothes?
You can almost see her question how she is presenting herself here, exposing her body in this manner, in an extremely intimate fashion, tempting us to look and gaze upon her and "feast" upon her with our eyes, to our own demise!  Yet you can also see she is suppressing that fear of wrongdoing and questioning her actions in the pride and stubbornness of  heart! 😭 It makes me so sad! 💔 This is the girl that claims she believes in God, from a group called Destiny's Child! No greater woes exist than those that exist for those who cause little ones to stumble. Shame on her. I hope she repents and turns to Christ Jesus, the Messiah and Savior of all mankind, if they only would repent and believe.
What the f**k is this video supposed to be? Terrible unless you're just here for the tities.
What is wit this video???
Great song! Who wrote that? You go Beyonce!!❤
What's with the video???
But Beyoncé- why the robotic porno look?
What is this
What the hell is she wearing...how embarrassing for her and her whole family
Hillbilly music?
Is this the actual video? This is the most stupid thing I have ever seen.
I’m sorry but why is she always half naked in all her songs😭?
I mean.. you’re Beyoncé. You’re already so great. The greatest! Why do you need to wear next to nothing? This isn’t really art.. or great fashion. It looks so slutty and you don’t need to dress like this to look beautiful and sexy.
Didn’t this used to be the “Hey it Franklin” theme song?
Soooooo, exactly what does this VIDEO have to do with COUNTRY music?? I’m lost?? 😮
How did this get so many likes? Video 🗑,  Song 🗑, Cleavage 🥵🔥
Can I just ask, WHO deemed this "country" ? Was there a vote or something ? Wtf ? Nashville Tennessee born & bred. I know country music & this right here... Ain't.
Trying to figure out why she needs to be half naked?
I wass already a country fan...but what is this-
Why is the whole video the same like 30 seconds over and over
What's up with Beyoncé's CGI boobs? They don't even move like boobs.😂
This is not country what the hell
is this porn?
She couldn't afford an undershirt? 😂
Is she doing "white face"? 😮
Really? Gotta call someone a bitch right off in your song. You just nasty and need to go back and learn etiquette.
This song hits but what is this mv?????
I'm curious, did they accidently edit out her belly button or are her pants over her belly button. Or is this a mistake and she just revealed she is a reptilian alien that doesn't have a belly button? Last ones a joke for all you people who took it serious. But seriously where the hell is her belly button 😅😂
Is this a joke ??or satire ??
Why does she have her books out
Doesn't this single have an official music video?
Wtfff is this video??? Shame on you beyonceeee
What the f is this film clip about
What happened with the hand hun ?
Don't understand this theme with her getup. How does it match with the country pop up?
WTF is this the whole video
She has no clue what country is.
When will she put out a death metal album?
Idk what to say about this she has a beautiful voice but idk if she should do country and the video sucks what is the video supposed to do with country. Her rack isn't a buck or anything it's just boobs her half naked has nothing to do with country
bro, why is the thumbnail so revealing dawg 😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀
Why tf is this all over my fyp?!??
Is this supposed to be a video? No wonder she has never won album of the year. She sucks bigtime!
Why does she have to dress all trashy my gosh get some class.
Why the nudity tho 🙄 the song is good enough… no need 🙈
Not sure it suits her
She killed it in this genre switchover.   Everyone doing country Now Drake is supposedly doing country…. I dunno if I can see it but we will see how he goes lol
What trash is this
Really? She needed to put the song to porn?
She did boobs and wanted so show it? 😂😂😂😂 It doesn’t look good 🥴
Is this the same person that did that creepy dancing baby meme in the early 2000s? Bc that's all I see in this video.
Music video sucks, what is this??????
Why in the world do they keep repeating the same scene?
How was she able to do a music video with so little clothes and yet it's STILL boring? 🤔 Thats skill or laziness 😂
This is ridiculous. Is this an actual song? Actual video?
Love the song...and love Beyonce...but is it just me or does this song sound more like Tracy Chapman?
Is the vest the reason this song is so popular?
Did the edit her nips out ?
Video meeting * What if we just did a loop of 18 seconds of Beyonce's boobs almost popping out of an open black leather vest, then her finger tracing up between her boobs and then she fake shoots bang bangs off her fingers"....  All male group "That tracks"
Girl why was I actually dancing to this it’s a bop
Is that the whole video?
Is this a actual song. Doesn't sound like any thought was put into the lyrics. This shit sucks ass.
Don't listen to Beyonce but needed to know if she did indeed copy Franklin. Yes
So would this be considered cultural appropriation now since black people say that white people in hip-hop are vulture Rising the culture I think Nick Cannon called Iggy Azalea a culture vulture
I’m sorry but do they use the same clip of her running her finger up her stomach to her boobs the only thing that is shown? Low value entertainment….
What the fuck is this shit 😂 this isn’t country fucking music
Why is she dressed like a stripper?  That doesn't go with the song, but the song is okay.
didn't beyonce used to be black?!
Couldn’t she have done a more Creative video?
Is Disney making country music now
im so confused rn
Why did I know she’d come out half naked😝 stay in your lane.  This doesn’t even sound right. ❌ why tho??
Is that it video
How is this even considered country ?
Idk why this song reminds me  of "Franklin The Turtle" cartoon song.
Is this R&B getting back at the country singers for trying to rap?
Left eye left arm y'all know?
Is this a country song??
Why the constant need to look slutty?
What part of the south is that outfit from? 😂
Isn’t this Franklin the Turtle theme? Skank ass thief
What does having no clothes on have to do with this song?  That chic is wicked to the core.
This? Country? I grew up in a small town of 3,500 people, she grew up in the big city of Houston. We drove lawn mowers to the hardware store or walked everywhere. We have worked hard with our two hands, manual labor. She probably has never picked up a tool in her life. People This ISNT country. This is a white collared lady who heavily relies on Hollywood to create a false image of country. Just because your from Texas doesn't automatically make you country girl. Leave it to the REAL country girls, we like to get dirty, work hard, love Jesus, and don't need no fancy hollywood gimmics!
Is this a cover
Is this all there is to her video?? THE WORST!!!
Why was it so hard to hear this song on you tube? White gay guy asking... this was good. ❤😊
God aweful. I wanna know who's responsible for writin these.nonsensical.lyrics(?). Lmao. Those.mixed with the Franklin song...yea, perfecto .😅😅😅 trash .
So what the song is amazing 🤩😍
It's catchy, Definitely can line dance to it... Just not sure if it's... A country song... Remember boot scoot and boogie.. To  me that's an example of a line dancing song. I was taught line dancing in my gym class, very rural area. But to me that's more line dancing.. A country song and a line dancing song are just different. I see people saying country song... Yeah but no... I guess it just depends on how you look at it❤❤❤ Love you beyonce
Why dress like that? Song is good,better to put some clothes on
Is this the music video???? If so, terrible!
Franklin....is that you? What the heck did I just watch?
Love the song but what the hall is she wearing?! She looks ridiculous 😂🤣
Doesn't this remind anyone besides me of the opening of The Rolling Stones "Prodigal Son"?
What's with this clip
Genuinely asking, why do you guys like this song? I don’t think anyone could come up with something more generic if they tried
Uhhhh… what?
Since when does a country boy drive a Lexus?
Did she have to dress like that I'm sure country singers normally dress like that .
What the hell crap did I just hear?
Are we supposed to be entertained by this redundant video?
Idk anyone in country or Texas that dresses like that 😮😂
What?😮😅😅😅
Why does she have to be naked....
Why is she topless😊
Anyone else missing times when female singers didn't have to perform naked? Apart from that, great song.
😂 🤣😅😂😅😂 WTF is this???
How do you block a song? I don’t ever wanna hear this 💩again lol
https://youtu.be/nlqyE-lWqCE?feature=shared  Does anyone else think Franklin The Turtle might be upset with her ripping off his theme song? 😂
Is this the official video??? Very disappointing..but the song is fire.
Wtf is this supposed to be?  Cant believe the white man holding this black woman down and forcing her to sing country music
Why does she insist on wearing very little, ruins her and the song.
Wonder how many NDAs were signed for this.
Wtf is this? Disgusting
Is it me or is the video just on loop? I thought I was experiencing technical issues with YouTube. 😅
What the fk was that?  That's not country music.
Did Kanye dress her? Looks just like what he’s got his wife and him wearing?!
A return of Sasha Fierce????
What is this 😂😂😂 Useless and senseless😂😂
Does this count as cultural appropriation? 😆😆💀
Can she not afford clothes?
What's the point of the video?
Is it really necessary to hang her boobs out
Dolly Parton on the remix?
Never shows her singing ?
Who else is here to see @Beyonce doing the ritual with the fingers?.
What in the hell is she wearing put some clothes on you have children that look up to you and here you are walking around half naked wtf
GRETCHEN WILSON ANYONE? God I can’t what into they’ve paid the media enough to NOT PLAY THIS AGAIN.
And the choreography? 🙈 Doesnt matter, the song is great! 👸🏻❤️
Nah! Its it about the song or nakeness?
Is it just me or does this song sound just like the “hey it’s Franklin” theme song?!?
Is she Becky with the good hair now?
Why ruin it with the gun stuff? Aren't we all against that?
Who called this country music
What’s with black woman trying to be white first the blonde wigs then trying to lighten skin and now they tryna steal country music .. this is TRASH for country music please someone stop this rubbish
Why does it just do that move over and over again btw love this song❤❤❤
What happened to her clothes? Did she lose them in a stampede?
I'm assuming the video is to accentuate the boob job?
Can she do it live without an enormous entourage
WTH???  Um stay in your lane, R&B!!  Oh, when you can't win R&B song of the year..... this is what ya do!
The song is ok buts what's with the outfit.
But way is she just walking and shooting her hand like it's a gun
If you think this is country...we need to talk.
What is happening
Lmbao, the real question is, is *"Beyoncé"* attempting to sell Country Music? Or is is *"Beyoncé"* attempting to sell *"Sexuality?"*  💯💯💯💯💯💯
Isn’t this the Franklin the turtle theme song?
I dont understand why this is country just sounds like a hip hop song with banjo added
Songs ok but wtf is up with the video
Wtf is this
What the hell is she wearing?  Has to cover the one eye.  Ooohhh no
Why bring half naked to country?
It's not country tho..... I'm not sure what it is to be honest
What bullshit is this?   Lmao
Why does she dress like a stripper, and she should have stuck to the music she is really great at.
Isn't she like 60? Put some damn clothes on.
Where the poker ?
Why does she always have to be naked? Issues
If I recorded myself doing a poo, added a country instrumental to it and titled it "poo'n aint holdn me down" does that make it country song or me a country singer?
Am not sure why anyone considers this county? Just because the words are Texas Hold ‘‘em doesn’t mean it’s country I mean I like it but it’s not what I would consider country music
Is this country?
Glue some metal on your face and do country.. what's she going to rip off after You & I?
Is she #1? in the US? I heard ithe song once and knew it. Now it‘s time for us in Europe. Congrats to this virtuell going timepraking genre you hit ❤️💐💫🙌💫
I wonder where the real Beyonce at?!! 🫥 Ole Sasha Fierce has stole the show and gone country with the one eye covered…
Since when does Beyoncé sing country???? Sounds like she trying to keep up with TAYLOR SWIFT 😅😅
Wtf is up with those boobs I mean can they be any more fake lmao 😅
Am I the only one who thinks this song is not that great
Why does this song sound like the theme song for Franklin the turtle 😂
How are people saying this does NOT sound country? I hate country music, this definitely sounds country, and its 🔥❤
Why is she dressed like this 😢
More country pop but not country.   What real country music has cuss words...I am stumped.
Where is the music video
Am I missing something ?Is this for real?Horrible video she must really love herself because this video is trash!
Why is she nearly naked?
Is this one seen in a loop? Her fans did all the work lol
But could she do it with her clothes on?
Is she selling her song or boobs…….boobs may bring a better price, songs sounds like a dolly repeat………..
What the fuck is this noise stay in your own lane
Is this the video for that? Is so its kinda weird but don't sound too bad
Taylor Who???????
Why does she always have to be nude?
why is she half naked ???
Are you even a singer without subliminal illuminati bs in a video? 💩
Country?? No, it’s a pop song not country at all
where is the video? This is boring as hell 😂😂😢😢😢. I guess if you show your body then you sell more records. But you do sound better Country. Not a fan anyway. The video is funny and sad at the same time.
Wtf did I just watch?
I don’t understand the video.  Is this supposed to be country music?
Why doesn't she put some cloths on? not crazy about the song.
I love me some Beyonce such a beautiful women.But why she gotta wear an outfit like that.Girl when your as beautiful as you are there is no need for us to see that much of what god created.
Why is she arrempting to make white music?
This is such a weird video….also why is her chest like vibrating near her collar bones?
Why is she trying to be white?
lol only good country song u mad right bros?
Is this the official video? It's not great like, I assume it's not
What in tarnation?
Reclaiming black music? Since when was country music black music. Never is the answer. This is cultural appropriation. You can’t have it all ways.
What's with the satanic eyewear?
Anyone else think she sounds like Sara Evans??
So the video is the one scene over and over?
Not the best video...why is she half naked for what reason does that have anything to do with the song...smh
Wjy do you have to show body parts to make something amazing!!!!  Taylor swift team!!!!!  I love Beyonce but really ??!!!
If this is country music why ain't it playin on my local country radio station, hmmmmmmmmm?
So what's so special about this song?
What exactly is country about this song?? It just sounds like shitty pop music.. MGK didn't do well swapping genres and neither did Beyonce
Is this a porno show?? 🤮
Is that song form formation album??? No???? Changed the path??? What happened????? Stick to something one please Beyoncé!!!! Or you wanna steal all music? Disgusting…….
When is the real music video coming out?
Why does she have to show half her boobs every time to sell a record?
Really.. Where is the class?  This is nothing close to Country Rap.
Uncle Tom country music???
Taylor who?
Wtf did she have to go and copy the Franklin cartoon theme song?
How did she keep that jacket on?  😅😂😅😂😅
So from award winning video from years..past to this?
Is there anything that Queen Bey cannot do????
Why is she naked ?
Can she do anything with out taking it to sex. Your an old woman put your clothes on.
Is this a joke?
Does Beyonce know who the 1981 bull riding champion winner at the Houston Live Stock and Rodeo?
Not sure what to think. Maybe a line dance song that they would play inbetween some real country music?
Is that beginning not Franklin the Turtle beat?!
cant even make a music video just looping the same 8 seconds ?
Why she looks so white?? Is she trying to pull a Michael Jackson? She is black so why she is trying to whiten her skin?
WTF is this !!
Why does she have to be almost naked that’s not what country is about. The song isn’t bad, but her being almost naked is a shame or country
So what is country about this?
Isn't this just Franklin the Turtle Theme Song? For those who know.....lolol
Why’s she naked?
So where is the country song she came out with?
Nice t#*ts. Other than that WTF is this garbage?
Is the video glitching, or is she doing the same stupid thing over and over again for almost 4 minutes?
I don’t get why she has to dress like that tho. How many other country artists are dressing like that?
I wonder how long she’ll focus on this genre? There are so many layers to explore it could really develop her sound to experiment there are moments in the song where it feels like she’s holding back gotta get into violins
The music nice but the video is not  what country is country
Why is She always half Naked?😮
What does  her out has to do with  country music   but Lyrics Is wonderful
This doesn’t sound like country. Plus I can’t put my nose on it but it sounds exactly like a song from a decade ago. Someone help me out with this.. like I know for a fact I’ve heard this same music or something nearly exactly similar
Also does she have to dress so cheap that is why men look at you like a toy
Does she have to it naked?
Ummm is there more to the video
those chords and harmonic shifts at the endddddd..... what is it going into??? what comes next???
Is there a non-jive version available?
Great song so what are they complaining about??? Great singer
What the heck it's that
Why do RnB singers have to ruin everything
This is "country" how?? Is it because you name a song with "Texas" in it that makes it country??
Ok wtf is this trash
Why does she has to show her boobs?  She is beautiful but doesn’t have to constantly showing this.  It’s annoying. I want to hear the lyrics not looking at her boobs.
Am I the Only person that Noticed Beyonce sampled some of this song from the classic Doug Cartoon ?? lol
What is she wearing?! 😳
Dolly Parton ?
What's with the mad max left eye thing? Good song..bad video
Is she even black anymore?
Why is the whole video just a 10 second clip on a loop??
The vocals are great, but what's with the rewinded walk and shoot performance with an open jacket, her breast practical 90% out and her panties showing😮😞😓🤦🏽‍♀️ I wish she would have picked another way/video of starting off her country album.
Is she trying to swap with T Swift?
Yea, but can she rap like Ben Shapiro?😂
Is it just me or is she getting more naked each time I see her advertised..,
Why is she half naked? Why do women always resort to this?  Is this the whole video or are they just replaying the same part over and over?
Why destroy the country image..smh
Visualizer? Of what? Body?
Why does she always have to be half naked all the time in her videos. Love the song though.
Why is she practically naked 😂
Cultural appropriation lmfao this isn't country. Its wannabe
What kind of a video is this? Am I missing something?
Why cant she perform without showing her skin, eh? Lol
I'm confused as usual. I think I like it?
Is Country dressing that way these days?  Gees!
Why is there hate for this?
Does she have Villa Lago like Michael Jackson cuz why does she look very white haha can't beat em join them haha
🤣🤣🤣 Did she SERIOUSLY release THAT as a country song???
Is this a joke?
How is this even classified as country ?
I absolutely love this song, but WTF can we see her boobs?
Is anyone hip to Willie Jones?? Look him up y'all!!
Did you all run out of money to make the rest of a video. 🤷‍♀️
Am i the only one who does hear the Franklin themed song
Is the whole music video just repeating I kinda wish she would have put on a western outfit
What is this shit?
I like it but what's up with this video????
Too racy, where's decency?
What is the point in this video.
Why do women keep getting implants lol.  Trust me ladies, most men can tell if they are fake.  It's better to have small natural boobs than to have big artificial silicone boobs.
I realize that some people say this doesn’t qualify as country. Hmm… I’m starting to wonder if it’s because she doesn’t fit the right hue in their eyes. When Taylor Swift did the same thing, it was country 😂
Did she go country because Taylor took all the Grammy's? Just asking for a friend😂😂😂😂
Cw is black in origin, however where are her clothes?
Is this the whole video?
Why tf is she naked tho?
What the hell!!!!???? Like seriously!? Please NO!!! AND WHAT IS THIS "VIDEO"????
Can someone explain the video and outfit ? Why the outfit (did we really need to see half of the boobs ? Doesn’t line up with the feel of music) and repetition of shooting and blowing out the gun? The creativeness is dull and uninspiring .
Why is she half naked?
Why does there always have to be nudity in music videos?
Cool song.. but what makes it county is my question?
This is Godawful, is she joking?
Sounds like a Gretchen Wilson or Shawna Twain song. Beyonce what are you doing?
Who else loves this song and thinks it's still country?
If this is what it takes for our people to regain our platform in any genre of music,we have to pray that some country artist come through with class. What does this song and video actually say about what we have to contribute to country music? This is sad.
So this is what classifies as a video now? 😂
What happened to Cultural appropriation? liberals really trying to ruin every single facet of civilization lmao
Why is she doing f the same thing over and over in this video? And that jacket is very, ummmmm, ridiculous? This isn’t country. Sounds slightly gospel to me
When is someone going to call her out for re-using old beats that isn't hers?
Lol why is this considered country? Because there is a guitar?
Hello, would you like to have a POPsaic style portrait? I am a visual artist from Cuba :)
Can something happen other than the same thing over and over and over and over and over? Was she short on funds? Lol
Why do they always have to use sex to sell their music?
Can't decide if this is better than I expected or worse
Come on now this song was ok and she's from Texas I think but a country hit please
Wtf is she wearing.  Doesn't sound good
What about the Gospel genre? OOPS. Nevermind. We KNOW she ain't going there😂
Why is she dressed like a lady of the night? Real country singers don't have to strip nearly naked to sing and sell their songs. Most have good values and morals and are cautious about exposing children to explicit nudity. Was there enough confidence in her that her song was good on it's own, or did it need near nudity to get people's attention?  🤔
Am I the only one who here PBS Kids in this beat
Were the boobs necessary???
Where’s the dance that’s gone viral? Does beyonce not do the dance? Everyone made that dance up to her song????
Y'all....like this?
is this really the official video? great song.. wtf is this video.. playing that same thing over and over...  was the budget 75$ ?
Is this meant to be so boring? Is that a thing now ?
why the baphomet resemblance ?  the hand signs
Chapel Heart is country, but this? I'm not sure.
Is this her idea of being rebellious and alternative like the metal hand she had last time? All the goths and metal heads around the world laughed at that
Wtf this the VIDEO FOR THE SOMG???😅😅😅😅
How is that a #1 song? Pretty much sucks
Where are the rest of her clothes?
How is this even country? And I don't even like country. I mean dude she messed up the Ave Maria and now this? I mean wtf.
What the hell is this shit, definitely ain’t Country
Is this a joke?
Wait am i stuck on repeat?
What message are kids supposed to think looking at her dressed like that and throwing swearing in her beautiful songs 🤦🏽‍♀️ I thought she was God fearing.
Where your clothes at B?
Uhh.. why? And who thinks this is good? Really.
Why she has to do so much cursing?
Is this fully an AI thing?😂
They call music videos "visualizers" now?
Someone explain to What is the point of this video please ? 🤔
Love the song but why a naked video?? Click bait or trying to be like Miley Cyrus😅
What the what!! What is this?!? How did this become number one on the country charts???
What the hell is this?.... Terrible, Terrible song. She is just trying to remain relevant in this business.
Audition for a strip club in Texas?
No music videos for act I and we are on act ii?
Wtf did I just watch? 😂😶
This Sucks !! Seroiusly wtf kind video is this ??
This song sucks and doesn't sound Country at all how did it become number 1 on the country charts?
Obvi that crap ain't texas. Did she watch like one cowboys and Indians type movie before writing these lyrics/notes??
We all know she can really sing  so why does she put this trash out.... i don't know what it is but it's not country
U call this country ? 🤬😭
I got so confused i was like why is the same clip repeating 😂😂   ( also me watches the whole thing to see if  anything changes😂)
Wtf makes this country? Just because it’s about Texas hold em? Definitely not country.
Am I the only one who was like dammit I thought this was the actual music video.....leaves....comes back ...😑........
anyone wondering  if she has nipples?
What ever happened to the genre I love
This is a joke, right?
Why?  hmm
I don't understand the repetitive looping in her videos? I don't find it creative. Please don't tell me there's genius within this simplicity.
Why would you just keep doing the same thing over and over? So some guy can spank it to your half naked body?
why are you naked??????
Why in the world does she have to get naked? It takes away from the song and very disrespectful to her children.
And again Beyoncé doing something that Kylie Minogue did before with Golden and Madonna with don't tell me...
So this is the song that has everyone in a frenzy? 😂
What is this 😂
Did Morgan help with this awesome tune?  https://youtu.be/bGlIGCR8hos?si=2anslSxqHDQn_MkH
Tf she dressed like lady gaga???
I don't understand why it does the same thing?
The thing is she would look much better in boots and jeans. This outfit is, cringe af.
Wth!?   Now im 20 secs in and the video is stupid good lawd.    Bless her
Is this really country? And is the video seriously just her half naked shooting a fake pistol?
Why is it always with the slutty clothes?  Many of our black queens in the music industry are doing this. Is this really what you need to do to sell records?
Really? Did she get bored?
uh why does the same scene repeat over & over?
Isn’t this called the so called “Culture Appropriation “?
Is the whole video just an old hag pretending to be a stripper?
This isn't country..try again lol
What is this crap???
I wonder since she from Texas and obviously shoots guns if she supports the 2nd amendment or acts like it? She is a Democrat ... Country person huh? Oddly, i dont think the ppl that pay her gonna support it. Umless this is to divide us nore than we already are.
And....? whatever....
What is this?!
Why doesn't she just go totally nude? She used to have way more class....them days are gone I guess.
can we right a song
Country?😂.   What’s country about it😂😂😂😂🤷🏼‍♂️.    I wouldn’t even have released this
No F-words or raunchy sexual lyrics like her other crap?
Boring. She would have looked so much better in some great country clothes.
What is the thing on her eye?
Am i the only one who hears the gambler from kenny rogers?😊
This is country? 🤨
Isn't this the Franklin theme song??🧐🧐🤔🤔
This is really the video?
Why does it sound like Franklin? Like way more obvious than Blurred Lines sounded like Got to Give it up.  https://youtu.be/injtQDE5GXQ?si=xJYP7yWK0c953eu9
Copying Shania much? 😅 video is tacky and cheap and best left to the likes of Kim K etc.
Is this why i seen A Compton Cowboy shirt at Walmart?
Why is she naked??? Nosense
Why even bother with a music video?
But whyyyyyy
Why's she so fine yet cringy as f
I don't really listen to country.  Is this how it sounds? I've never seen any country stars dress like this? I know Dolly who I have always believed to be the Queen of Country never went on stage  without a shirt or pants!!!
Is this cultural appropriation?
Great song but why the outfit?
Any chance for album of the year?  😂
WTH is this!
Not a country fan at all. Question…do country videos usually have boobs hanging out in them?
i love you bey but idk how to feel about this song
Anybody else only hear "The Gambler" when the music starts?
WTH is the matter with her?
Ok how many takes? 😂
Why didn't she dance I sure was waiting But i gather she didnt have enough clothes on😢
I thought she retired..... usually when you retire, you dont come out with new music every other year
Love the song but awful video. What the...? She phoned it in for sure
And I question how is this song a number anywhere...take away the video..just listen to the song and it's the same riff over and over and over with different words...
Am I the only one who thinks this is terrible?
Is this a mocking parody?  I seem to recall this thing called cultural appropriation.  If this ain't it, then nothing is.
What kinda  video is this what a waste of film 🙄
LOL WHAT IS THIS
Wait do I hear franklin the turttle theme song? Is it just me... it has a similar melody..
Why would this be a good song to line dance to!?🤠
Beonce Doing Country? Isn't She Number in R & B? Country  I just dont see it.
Doesn’t she have a stylist or someone to tell her to put some clothes on?
What’s up with this video!
Is that Seven of Nine?
Just MAYBE these so called "artists" would actually compose NEW melodies instead of regurgitating old song compositions lol. But hey, they ALL do it. There's no such thing as original, that ship sailed forever ago.
What happened to the days when female pop/soul/country stars didn't have to dress like hookers to sell records? She's about as country as Xaviera Hollander.
Who wrote this song though 🤔
😅is this a joke. 🎉 clown 😂 your not country music.  Lil ma hip hop. 😅
She she filmed one 8 second scene and just played it over and over and over? I'm lost
Love this, but why is she wearing one solarium eye goggle
Where is the country song 🤔 i didn't hear it.
Is this an actual video?
Double sided tape??  Very catchy song.  There are various choreographed line dances to it all over YouTube.
Why is she wearing nothing ??ridiculous
What makes this country? The only thing country is the banjo in the background at times.😄
I don't know about that outfit 🤔
Wtf us this? Another crap pop song labeled country
Did she copy Franklin the turtle theme song?
Porn B or Queen B that is the question
County?😂more like clowning country 😂
That's all she does the whole time ???????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂boooooooooringgggggg
Wonder what she always has to be naked… poor girl
What is this crap
I dont know,  but there's something about looking like a stripper and country music that dont mix. And "bitch"???
Did I miss a video?  Or is it really the exact same move over and over and over again?
Where is your shirt
Is she just doing this to make a big impact and be talked about?
Isn't this the Franklin song just with different words?
If you guys wanna check out some ACTUAL country - check out Sierra Ferrell because I don’t know what this is. Stay in your lane Beyoncé 😂
This is not giving
What cowboy pulls up in a Lexus? 🤷
So y’all know she stole this from Franklin the Turtle right?? Maybe not the lyrics but the beat for sure
Now she's making visualizer videos who doesn't even show up much in talk show when she don't need us 😂😂and trying country why..??i think i know
Just hecause she sings about Texas doesn't make this a country song, sorry, was this done because Tracy Champman appeared on the country charts with the rerelease of Fast Car?
why is she naked :/
Not sure about doing country music half naked .. something off about it
What is this?
Wth is that get up she has on? Not to mention their corny song.
A great outfit for a Mother with young impressionable Children  huh ? . 😮 😢 Seams like it don't fit the song. Her voice is Beautiful.
There are certain artists that no matter what crap they release and people this is crap, their fans will purchase or call it a masterpiece. Come on are fans really that tone deaf??? There's a reason she's half naked, and that's to distract her fans from the bad music.
I’m with the song, but why the hell is this her attire? B you were supposed to kill the dance moves with this song like we know you could.
Music is nice, but why she has to get almost naked, and trashy looking
Women in country music have more class then this,why the trashy outfit if she thought she could sell a country song with her voice!
What is she (not) wearing? She has the greatest voice, why'd you have to go cheap??!
Is it just me or the video is just 10 seconds going on and on and on all the same 🤔
Hey this is Franklin… lol…. Can any one day copy right infringement 😂😂😂👀
When was this written? When did it come out? I’ve heard this before this isn’t new.
The songs alright but the video.... Was this 30 seconds and just put on repeat? Extremely lazy.
Country?  Really???
That's the best video/choreography they could come up with for this video?
Why foul language? That's not country bringing the hood into country music, Can't we keep anything clean?
How could she forget her shirt?
Will there  be a music video?
What to your shirt?😢
What is the point of looping the same video? Is there an artistic message I’m missing? Honestly love B but this felt like a porn gif on repeat
I wonder which County musician she stole this song from?
What’s up with this video
What's with the plastic wrap on her eye? Why do we have to see her cleavage?
Wtf does her being half naked have anything to do with this song? Can u say needing attention much, this is absolutely horrible
🤦‍♀️ why does she have to be half naked? Seriously  Nice melody, but the lyrics aint
What does she even talking about in the song is she talking about all the black on black crime and blame it on the white people and how white people take Grammys from her. Blaming everybody
The song is great! But why cursing? Don't hear that in country songs. Video is gross.
Could she have any more clothes on?!?! 😂
Why is this video 8 hours long
Her husband makes a fit and then she turns county?? She doesn’t seem to like it…..
Really?
Wait WF is she wearing 😂
Why is she almost completely naked? There is no need for it…
When did we go from Halo to curse words half of a song 😢
🤦🤣🤣so she has to show a half boob to get back in the vibe ? 🤦🤦🤦
And why does she have to be half naked?
Whoa what the hell happened to being elegant n beautiful girl, Jay - Z fkd up you in too many ways aye, when yah going to stand up for yourself. Bring back that church going and God fearing good girl.
Why is she almost naked. Girl put some clothes on
Why is it all the same?
Why the nudity?
This is country?
What the heck is a "Visualizer"? And that outfit is ridiculous.
Is this video a joke? Is the song a joke?!? What in the name of boring is this a loop of the same shot?
Video is 👎👎..trashy.. one eyed stuff.. illuminati??
WTF is she wearing?  Definitely not country. Hey Dolly, hey Loretta, she needs some schoolin’!
Wtf is this garbage
How old is her kids now? Is it necessary?
What is this trash 🤮🤮🤮
Is it just me or is the whole video basically on repeat and shes doing the same thing on repeat? I mean hey, takes a master musician to put that together right. Hard pass, garbage.
sorry im trying to understand how this is a country song ?
Something wrong with wearing clothing? Too much nudity and too much swearing for this genre
WTF is that outfit you look ridiculous?  Seems like you're making fun of country music honestly.
Does she need to dress like this? 👎🏾
🤔...is this for real?  Seriously? Ahh...I never seen anyone sing naked and use derogatory  language in a country song? 🙆‍♀️
What makes this song country?
Cultral appropreation? Why is Beyonce taking the whyte peoples culture? is she trying to be whyte?
Cultural appropriation? Or free speech. Its all good but it actually bad video.
So Beyoncé thinks she’s The Lumineers now ? This sounds like a folk song with the heavy use of Banjo 🪕 I hate it 😅
Why half naked?
The heck is she wearing? Why does every genre of music need to be hoe-ified?
Did she sample this song from Franklin theme song?
2:47 is that a music video??  Song's good though.
Why she tryna look like Latto lately 😂
Is this supposed to be a music video?!
wtf is this crap !?!?!
.... wtf is this . Its sure not country lol.
Why is she half naked?
Song is catchy.  Is an "official visualizer" what you call a  clip put on a loop?
Why does she need to be basically naked
Couldn't she have sung that song without trying to reveal her body. Let's leave nothing to the imagination.Real country is long gone.
Why would she wear that?
WHAT THE F--- IS THE POINT OF REPEATING THIS HALF NUDE SCENE OVER AND OVER?? BOOOOORING!!!!
Is there a song on here been a little distracted 😂
What the fuck is this?
Where are her clothes? I'm trying to raise my daughter to be classy, not trashy, no thanks.
My ears just threw up and my eyes are bleeding. Is that supposed to happen?
Why didn't she just do vid- naked!?😢
This is Christian is it? Yeah right and isn't this cultural appropriation? Hypocrite
Ok where are clothes?Oh hell nooooo!!!!
Jellyroll remix??
you sure this is country stylized?   not a fan.
What can I do to make myself relevant!? 🤔  I know💡 I'll do a country music song 😮
Whats is it with females whobthe bat trying to figure me out boss degree  you know you on it ,,, you want to hold em and i will let them hold you ❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉😢😢😅😮😮
Was that a nip slip I saw? Geez, what's with all the boobs hanging out?
Used to be a huge fan but she took the piss out of Taylor swift and now she's blonde and doing country music...... hmm 😒 copying much?
Franklin the turtle???
I like the song but why is the video so hoe-ish?
Is there some kind of hidden message in this video?  How many times its repeat this loop? What seconds she fire?
Is this Franklin the Turtles beat...
Is this the actual video, it's trash ...half your breast out.. come on...make a real video with some story...not some cheap sexual crap.
Hold on, is this it in terms of visuals? Excuse my ignorance yall, just want more than this repetetive visual...  Song is banging though
Why are people acting like this is Beyonce first rodeo 😂 she has done country music before
So years ago nashville powers were up in arms that Shania Twain was showing her belly button? Granted Beyonce did at least cover up her belly button.😂😂😂😂🤣
Did SHE wrote the song? Doubt it
I guess this is an ok line dancing song but, is it really country? I mean she not runnin from da law, her man (likely her brother/cousin/uncle) aint dun left her, and all her animules is still livin, so...???
There is a very nice challenge in tiktok. People dancing this song country style. Cool ❤
I’m confused not accustomed to hearing Beyonce sing this genre..
Is this the song video??? Can't be. Why so low budget?
the song is great but there is no need for Beyonce to wear this vulgar outfit… refer to Madonna in her cowboy moment, she wore a simple shirt and pair of jeans, it was damn sexy😅
In what alternate dimension is this considered country?
Why everyone hating ? I enjoyed it pretty well.
I don’t get the video?
who's here from YouBetcha Radio?
Why.. I mean why.. there's enough pop country.
WTF is this stupidity?
Hmmm, wonder what ppl think of this. It’s more a nod to the genre not an actual transition to the genre unless a real video is yet to come. Should have cowboy shit on, cowboy hat, country shit, trucks, if it’s about poker maybe some saloon poker stuff. This look ain’t it, but the bazookas out okay
Everyone excited to see some transsexual show some cleavage?
Why do it just keep repeating the same shot? She could have done so much more for this music video!
Is this all AI generated?
Must sex always be in the mix and for sale by modern female music artist?  What happened to the Whitney Houstons or the Sades?
Why does she or anyone think that's COUNTRY music.
They couldn't come up with any more ideas on the video?
the entire video is the artist all glammed up with lots of skin showing?  is that country now?
Is this the ORIGINAL  video?? Because if so, Beyonce has a bloated sense of self!¡!¡  Song was GREAT!! She looks STUNNING!!!! She isnt trying to infiltrate country music . The lady IS SOUTHERN!! She has always had a clear accent or drawl.  I look forward to hearing more.
Why is she dressed like a street walker, as usual?
Where is the funko?
Why does she have to wear such provocative suit?😮
Who else can hear the gunshots? 😮
What makes this a country song and not a pop song
Why do these pop "stars" always have to be so trashy? I guess music isn't enough. You have to show tits to grab people's attention.
Is that a patch on her eye, why?
Meh, and what's with the boring looping video ?
Ppl like this?
So she's no longer making music videos?...
What is the purpose of this video......................great song
What the fuck is this and is this video 😂😂😂😂😂😂
How is this country music? It is just another Pop song with a country twist by the great Beyonce but nothing else.
The most lazzy videoclip I have see from 1990 until now! Sex & Guns for what? 🤔 She promovate to killing people? 🙄
lol why do people like her when there are so many talented black female musicians. Americas are so desperate to like anything that someone else likes they like this garbage.
Why isn't this on my TL every day I literally have to search it. I'm a die hard Bey fan this should automatically pop up
First country song I’m listening to in how many years now? 15 years 🫠
How can you be so rich and not put out a good song? Especially when you have multiple writers, and family members who might have told you that this was beyond awful. It was painfully bad.
Is this a joke? Beyoncé from the video to the song you coulda done way better I feel like the video is on repeat of u walking and your finger shooting🤣. I’m sorry but it’s horrible.
Please explain how this is country music
The video?? Repeated scene? 🤔
So does Beyoncé have Afro hair under those wigs?
Why. Just why. Just stick to R&B. Sorry B fans. Her voice is just so good in the R&B genre. Not this. I get it she’s diverse but not everything works.
Is this really what all the fuss is about, really?
What is she wearing? Love the song hate the outfit doesn't quite go with the song?
Uhm what
How do we get this to go number one on billboard
Why does America or wherever call biracial people black ?if they have white blood also in their veins , its so rediculous , rather not say anything, if you so concerned about racial matters ,z why uplift one part and not the other part? all people by now come from mixed races,  my son has a lovely woman she is   a dark lady a beautiful person and if she has a child , i would want the child to he proud of  my side as well
no class............why? why be slutty, why cuss to make music. Ridiculous. Great song.....but
Is this a joke? 😂😂😂😂 what is this video?😂😂😂😂 Queen B. Thank you for this laugh.  The tune is catchy.
Soooo, she has to be half nekkid to get likes? Nah, no like from me.
this is really considered a  country song??🤨🤷🏽‍♀️
Am I the only one hoping to see some nipple action?
Can you become North’s teacher? I don’t want North to become like Cardi B
Why does she have to be half naked just to sing.  Then Taylor Swift just has too shakes it
And what exactly is this called? And what the hell is she singing about?
Houston resident here wondering what took her so long...
How is this song good? Yall tripping this song sucks.
What's the point of the video?
🙄 why the nudity?? let the music stand for itself, intead of click baiting so people can get a glance. I'm over it.
Wtf is this GARBAGE?
How does this trash make it to #1? Fuckin hick-hop, tractor rap bullshit.
Why can’t she come up with a good dance song?
Is this what we call a music video in 2024?! I miss MTV and VH1. Take me back….
I'm all for a risk and changing things up, but don't understand why she felt to dress like a stripper. This is country girl.
So who paid paid Billboard or the CMA for this to be #1? The tune is catchy but not number 1. It's #1 because of the Name Beyonce..not the song
Do women always have to be half naked?
Awful song 😂😂 what's with the background singers?
Is this white cultural appropriation ?????? Jk lol good song
Why's it kinda eat though
Wtf is that outfit… don’t make country whoreish like everything else plzzzzz. So sick of it. 💀 As far as sticking to the genre sound-wise, I was ready to be mad, but it is fairly country except the outro.
Really?  This is a horrible song.
WTF is this?
What the heck is this? 🙅‍♀️
Is this a joke? Made number 1 on Top 20??? It sucks!!!
This is country?….
Beyoncé used to be the shit what the hell happened.
What's a half naked women have to do with country music?
umm what is this.....
Wtf is this shit?!?! 🤦‍♀️🤣
This is the video?
Did they just film one scene and then put it on repeat?
Song is OK but why that outfit? 😮
Guess is this supposed to be serious? 😂
How many takes did she do??? Nip slip country 😅
I love this.  Has she done an entire album in this genre?  I have got to get this.
What's up with the boobs? 😂
Not country and why half naked?  Not a fan
Why does she have to be almost naked? Isn't the song good enough on its own?
Is this actually good, or am I just tripping? Obviously it's not authentic country, but when was the last time that even existed?
Is this like a new movement? Bleached skin and blonde hair? Real question.
What happened to creativity? That’s all they could come up with for a video for this song?
could you be any lazier in making a video???
This feels more like a parody. I can't take it seriously..also a bit poppy but it is catchy so I'm sure it will do well in the dance halls. Probably fun to dance to. I feel like this is Beyonce saying "tell me what else I can't do boys....who's next?"
Where’s the country part?
Wonder what would have happened if this song was played incognito 😮
What am I missing. 🗑️
Fuck is this?
are any taylor swifts using the snake on her sunglasses as a theory they have a duet coming?!
Whats going on with this song? Lol
What’s with the boobs
Why is this video so low effort though?
What happened to her clothes....yikes
Is this a joke?!? 😂😂😂 she’s really reaching for her Grammy!! LMAOOO   Is that her country moves? Pow pow…🤣🤣
Whats country about this ?
Headed to the dive bar? She's never stepped foot in a dive
Love beyonce, the song is amazifn as well but this doesnt sound like country im confused ?
Is that the actual video? There's nothing to it. The lyrics seem to be stuck on repeat. Not much to them either. I expected a lot better.
They call this country? This ain’t country.
Is this the actual video? I like the song but this video is weird
This is country? Why because it has a banjo?
So is it the music that makes it country or the voice?
What did country ever do to you? Please for the love of everything 🛑
Who's the genius that came up with this music video on a loop?
Is this a joke 😂😂 At her fame level she could probably just snore to the beat and people will swear it’s the greatest song ever 🤣🤣
What's with her appropriating long blonde hair?????
That's not country. I wanna know how many dive bars Beyonce sat in the back of playing an acoustic guitar...Posers unite
Is that a video or a GIF
Franklin the turtle?
Tornados? Basement? This bitch is crazy lol
This a joke right? 😂🤣🤣 😂
Yo this shit is pop with country instrumental WTF
Not sure if I'd call it country but I don't hate it....
Cover up girl! U r a role model for your daughters! Is that what u want blue to b seeing???
Is this supposed to be a video by a "SUPERSTAR"...  And this song has no country sound/vibe whatsoever...
Isn't it that the Democrats are trying to get the Texan in their pocket?
Anyone else wondering where the hell her nipples are?? l
Glorify gun use like the US isn't in crisis?
What in the illuminatti is this?!?  Is this SNL?
So she can’t make it anymore with her other music? Now, she is a country artist? Really? This is sleezy country music. I could not listen to hardly half of this song. This is not country music. #TobyKeith
Wtf is with the video . On a loop ?
So cause it has a twang to it and some "country" words its automatically country? Ok you know what i don't even like country music and I don't like Beyonce im a metalhead i just wanted to see what the big deal was why everyone is making a fuss.
Put some clothing on, this isn't going to make you relevant,  why put that image out there for young people.. you're a has been!! Put some damn clothing on!!!
Does she wants to be white? What is with country music, it all sounds the same, same semi naked body, and same rhythm…🫣🫣😷
Is she on drugs…are we not trying anymore?
If she's so great, why does she always feel the need to expose herself for attention? And women wonder why men look at them like a piece of meat, or think of them as bimbos. Respect yourself and put some dang clothes on.
Wtf is going on? Why is it the same thing over and over
Why she always so naked!!!
WHY DOES SHE KEEP DOING THE SAME THING ON THE VIDEO..NOT VERY CREATIVE EXCEPT THE GUYS WILL LIKE HER CHEST..
why its hate or somebody's mad cause they don't like the song?. some of you and your fandom is weird af.. I like the other song better and i will support this sister making a country album because we as a people are talented enough to be number in any genre of music.. But going at people over their opinion is crazyy
Is this a joke 😂😂😂
So if this is country does that make michael jackson the king of country?
Couldn't they do something more for the video tho?
Why is this considered country....?
Songs  not bad, but why does she have to dress like a whole in the video.
So who wrote this song for her?
So she just walks, stands still, takes her left hand and seductively raises it past her enormous implants. Then tilts that left  hand to her left, flicks it twice, with flashes, then blows the smoke away - simulating gun shots.   Over and over.   What is she trying to do?  What’s the meaning of the flick flash?     Come on Lady B, you’re better than this.
This is not country music and why is she half naked!!!!
Is this actually the official video? Love, love the song, but this is the most boring video ever. I was waiting for it to start and it never did….
Is it a good country song? It's too pop for my liking.
WTF is that?  I'm not sure you'd hear that on any country music radio station.
what is this  where is the country in this and why the monotonous video??
Yo what made you do this my neega???
What was that?
Why does she have to be half naked singing a country song?
What's with black people and nudity?
In the year 3024, archaeologists Will dig up this banger and wonder what kind of ritualistic dance we performed to summon rain.☔️💃🕺
tf was that?? 🤔
Country?
Umm what did i just watch and listen to exactly
Oh hell no. Is this what constitutes for art now? Put some clothes on.
This is not giving
Is there anything Bey can’t do??
Great music .. love her voice .. but the outfit? Not impressed with the nakedness .. the simple nostalgia of country would have been more impressive in my old lady country classic opinion
Why doesn't she make an actual video
Seriously? Did she forget to put on clothes? Oh, my bad. She just likes exposing herself.
The mix seems really flat and quiet. Can't tell if that's a YT thing or if the song is just kinda flat on its own. Anyone else know?
Oh so when whites rap y'all call it cultural appropriation but expect whites to be silent about this garbage 🗑️? 🤦🏾‍♂️
What the hell is this dog shit?
The video is just not doing anything for me?  Song is ify as well.
Song is good the video I don't get it
Can someone fill me in on the WHY to this...why did we need this? What's up with Beyonce?
Where is the country inspiration in this song? This ain’t no Hank Williams.
I quite like the song, but what's with the video? C'mon Bey, you coulda given us  way more than strut, pose, shoot on repeat😁.
video is ??? But I love the song!
This is the best video they could come up with?
Where’s the line dance with the song?❤
Idk anything about country or if this is considered “real country” but i do kinda like it
What the heck is she wearing? She mind as well  get naked.
Doesn't this fall under culture appropriation? She's literally singing about things she knows nothing about. Stay in your lane
Wtf is this 😂
For the money she has could she not buy herself a t shirt🙄🙄
Um why the replay button stuck
I like the song a lot. This video though.... Is that all there is? Her half naked pointing two fingers like a gun? Ummm.... OK.🤷‍♀
Is this what people think country is ?
How did she memorize that choreography?
Song is alright but seriously what's up with the outfit kinda trashy well really trashy kinda no need for it
Why the video when it’s the same thing in repeat.  🙄
Why sexialize it?
So country is basically soft porn now?
whenever female performers dress like that it's to get the attention they know their music won't get.  Have you ever seen Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell or Carole King dress like that?  No.  Their music speaks for itself.
Again as little clothes as possible, what is she selling body or bad country music😅😅😅😢
I wonder who really wrote this song? Since it’s common knowledge she steals credit, and uses her power to force the real writers into signing NDA’s.
The lyrics are questionable - why we got to be b_ _ _ _ _ _ s
Hahaha! That's not country and wtf why is she trying to look like a white girl? She trying to be Taylor ? That outfit too
How is this garbage country ??
Wait, she just repeats the same soft-porn video snippet again and again?
Soooo what makes this country??? 🤔
I don't get it.  Is this visualization questionable as MTV Europe pop rock was to us in USA back in the day? Sledgehammer artistic was weird.
What sort of a video clip is this?
Where’s her clothes? Dear me😳
What’s with the video? Could’ve done so much more with this
Idk whether this song is good or terrible like I love it yet hate it idk if this was too much , just right, or too little. Idk wtf is going on 🤣💀
Why is it necessary to show tits bouncing under hot set lights, gross. Can't the song and the talent be enough?
Beyonce and miranda lambert collab next? 👀
Are real cowgirls dressed like this? 🤔
Why aren't there any good musicvideos??
Why is everything heavily sexualized?
Is it just me or is this video a lot of nothing?   Doesn't seem to go with the song.
Is this the official music viddy? Cause I’m confused after the 6th loop lol 😅
When has Beyonce and Jay-Z been to the dive bar?? 😭
Is it fear that Beyoncé will do country music better than those country 'singers' doing it for years the reason for all this outrage? 😂😂😂 Do ya thang girl! Racists are too ridiculous...
How do they find that banjo sound on the beat machine
…the country influence is lacking. More like gospel folk music (is that redundant?)
As far as the music is concerned it’s OK, Blues man Ray Charles added Country Music to his repertoire of genres he performed amongst a host of other musical forms.  However, the attire displayed at the beginning of the music is definitely in bad taste from my perspective: how many want to be Country artists have you seen dressed in such a provocative manner?  Most importantly, “What’s the intent? 😖       QUESTION EVERYTHING: What Is The Truth (WITT)???  🤨       GYHOOYA: OYE!!!  😤
Not seeing what yall damn hyped about sounds like any other Beyonce song
Yall never sid nun when taylor swift changed from country to pop did yall??? Oh ok so stop hating beyonce ate ok
That is a joke right?  That won’t country. Stick to what you know lady. And the video is shit
Why does it sound like it was recorded 20yrs ago though? Lol or under water. Sound quality is fuckin awful! 😂😂😂
Ok so am I the only one that want to learn how to line dance to this??
What are you all on because you need to share this is trash wtf even is this do you genuinely like this or is it because its Beyoncé like what the hell😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is the.video so bland for such a fun song
Why does she have to dress like that. So inappropriate 😔
Love the song but why be practically naked? Sheesh.
Why is she making country music slutty?
Hate it! Why is she wearing a aluminum foil eye patch?  Never knew country folk dressed like they worked for the chicken ranch
Not looking much like a cow girl. Much more like an exotic dancer, and that’s the whole video? 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Nah this isn’t it
Wtf is this shit
Am I the only one who needs a Kacey muscraves X Beyoncé song or what 👀
What does dressing like a whore have to do with country music ?
Why always fkn  half naked? Cant she sell with talent??  And we all know they get lipos every other week!
How can yall even put this a country music conversation
What the actual hell is this video?!!  🤮  Does no one realize why it’s so repetitive in her motions, over and over - with one of her eyes covered?!   It does NOT get more demonic than music that comes with a pretty face.
I feel like saying this is country is a stretch, but she’s talented and did great as always
This is the video? The same thing over and over??
Searching for that album if the year🙄
Does she have to be naked for everything???? Good grief!!!
Not sure if she trying to do country or  Onlyfans ... not really country music so, narrowing it down...
Is it just me or did I hear blue ivy say “ pink boots “ at the end 3:28, THAT SOUNDED LIKE ONE OF HER CHILDREN
not country. Susks.
Wait a minute...this ain't the video! Is she not gonna do videos any more?
Is this the only video to this?
How many underage girls have given birth to Jay-Z's children?
Was the open bust necessary for that kind of music?
Clothes?
Why is the video so boring tho
Cmon wtf she wearing? Can she do anything without looking trashy? Anything at all???
This is a joke right!?!
What's up with them fake ass ta tas spread tooo far apart?
Why does everything have to have sex and nudity in it? Is there nothing else in the world?
Great song video 😮 can you put your top on plz😅
Does she have to be naked in everything
I love the song!! But is this all there is to the Video? Just one shot and put it on loop🙄
Where is her clothes
Wtf is this 😂
What kinda video is this? Why is her 🐈 on repeat???????????
Hmmm I love her voice I don't think the half nakedness works .And something bothers me about her voice with country .maybe it's the material and the sound .I do love her other music for sure .totally awsome .❤❤
Love her but wtf is the deal with the video repeatedly having the same thing, not something I'd expect from her
This ain't Texas?! What a crappy song.
Why show so much skin?
How is this not top 10?
Nice song. Why is she practically naked in the visual? How does that do anything but provoke sexual thoughts?
Why is her skin white, has she been beaching it
She looks like an android, not any were near country?
Why does she have to be half naked. Song is great... but.  WOW
does she have the disease Michael Jackson had?
Lmao wtf Beyonce and why is she so light skin now ? Is that not weird
what the fuck
WTF was country about this song. Fake country isn't country #bringbackhaggard
Ok, beehive... Where's the rest of it?😳
Why does she need to dress so nasty. Just think of all the young women that are looking up to her.
Beyoncé has been ready for country music for a long time. The question is, is country music ready for Beyoncé? I know I am.
What is this?
Not a fan of her’s but I like this song. I’m just not sure why it’s the same image over & over?
in what world is this classified as country music?
Why does she have to be half naked? Come on its 2024 talent does not require getting your kit off anymore.
Anyone else hear similarities with this song and Dixieland Delight by Alabama? I don't think it's sampled in the song, my ear just hears them in a similar way 😊
Country music Very good, but... where's the coreografy????
I think she did a great job on the song but why she gotta be half naked in the video , that doesn’t throw out country music vibes
Did she just do 1 song or a whole album?
What's with the no bra an skimpy underwear? Never seen country singers dress like this performing
When did she get a boob job?
I love Beyoncé but like when black people do this it’s ok but if white people rap we’re culturally appropriating? Make it make sense
😳 um🤔 it would have to grow on me.☝🏽😃 Ask me this time next year.
Anybody else realize she put herself on loop and keep watching the loop for 3 minutes and 57 seconds? No? Just me. 😂😂❤
Does anyone understand what this video means? Why is it just a repeating loop of her walking, touching her abdomen and pretending to shoot with her left hand? What does a silver snake on the left eye mean? I really like this song but the video is strange.
okay so were now trying to F#k our way to a grammy?
So now what's next B-hive do a Texas Square Dance.
Why does she need to come out half naked?? She already sells alot of albums. Its not like she needs to show it all. I have never seen Beyonce like this. She was so  classy but I guess not anymore
Oh boy wonder who's her and Jay-Z gonna get mad at the CMT awards because his wife didn't win 😂😂😂😂😂 this song is wack as hell
Who produced that video? It's rough for an A level star.
Does being from Texas make you country?
Call me old fashioned but wtf's up with the outfit...or lack thereof!?
How many times..... will caucasian people STEAL from other cultures. Than get "angry" when it's reclaimed & ACT like they own it. Honestly. It's pathetic & disgusting. But all love to everyone, all the same.
If she's so talented, why does she have to rely on an up-close shot of her breasts every 8 seconds???
Why cant she find something else to do in her spare time.. She has enough money
How is this a good song? Her voice is good but she says nothing. Why does she have to be damn near naked to do this video if you can call it a video? Did we all see and hear the same video? I initially thought I was being punked  but it’s real? Wow
wts is this trash?
I love you Beyonce but CAN YOU DO AN ACTUAL VIDEO PLEASE???
I love the song, but more scenery  should have been added unless i'm missing something
What kind of video is this supposed to be? Lots of repetition. It's almost like it's supposed to hypnotize you.
Is this a safe space?....
What the in the ai generated video shit was that
She’s a woman singing country who cares about her race? Love her and she did an amazing job. we don’t have to point out that she’s black singing country
And she had to expose major boobs becauae?
Is that all she does the whole video?
Will they play it in a hip hop club? Or will we have to go to a country bar to hear it? I think because she's done so much for OUR community, any club should play it. Let us have fun and line dance in the middle of a hip hop club! We deserve that!
Why does she not have a shirt on  I’m traumatized 😭😭😭
Can someone tell me who's taken music history and has an understanding of music why this sounds kinda like pop to me it sounds like pop country like Taylor swift
Why is nothing she shows reflecting any of her words? She's looking like a 304, but she pretends to have values
Stay in your lane was curious. Now just disappointed SMH
Does she even know what a dive bar is 😂😂
What’s going on?
Say mane, wtf is this
Who is this white lady and why is her music so bad ?
I like the song, it's got a catchy tune. But, I wonder why she needs to be so undressed ? I'm not prude, I fail to see the point of that 😕
Stupid song has no point stupid video over and over same thing? Beyonce trying to rule country music now? LMAO 😂😂😂WTF???
Why does Beyonce feel the need to show her private parts to get attention? Doesn't she think her music is good enough? #insecurities
Can someone hurry up and come up with the Texas Hold ‘Em Challenge dance so I can binge watch while I listen to this song?!
Awful and why that outfit and hairstyle looks like Lady Gaga
Is this a joke
This is whack....whos playing the instrument's? Who wrote the song? It wasnt Beyonce.
The song makes me wonder if anyone involved has actually ever listened to a country song
why would u just not stay in yo lane babe
I’m sorry wth is this video
It's a great song, but is the outfit really necessary?
Taylor Swift, Pink, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, Gwen Stefani, all changed music genres at one point & you didn't hear people complain. Beyonce does & they lose their minds. I wonder what the other ladies have in common? 🤔
Is the video on repeat?
I wasn’t paying attention was she singing something??
Why is she showing her breast like that
Zydeco is still alive n well I wonder she gonna venture into it
she’s doing a huge risk. I wonder is it going to pay out in the end.
I am a metal head. Never liked country and didn't care much for Beyoncé's music, BUT WHY DO I REALLY LOVE THIS?
Why does this make her more 🔥
Does anyone else hear Kelly in the background?
Am I missing something?  Is she ever going to make a video anymore?
I didn't know she had a boob job? what else is fake?
Why is she white now?
@Beyonce can you have your team turn on the captions/subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing? Thank you!!
All good But what’s with the clothing  Can a song be sung without this kind of dressing
So yall didn’t like daddy’s little girl? Cause that was definitely a country song 😅
how many times does have to do the same thing crap song
Why her video is on repeat?
Still trying to figure out   the outfit there's a difference between being sexy and sleazy might as well be walking around with no shirt on I think that looks ridiculous she looks like she's ready to freaking jump on the stripper pole
Give me a break this isn't country and the outfit...really...your beautiful we know this....do you really have to expose your body for attention? Maybe you do because the song isn't good!
wtf is this video 🤢
I don't get it, if she is supposed to be such a great singer, why is she always half naked in her videos?
What the fxxk is this shit???
This all the video???? Ok
Am I the only one who thinks this ain't it..  I mean her voice is always great but this lyrics and so.. nah
why she 0,.5 nekkid?
Why is she naked in both videos pretty much?
Hmmmm… imma have to pass on that one. 😂🤣
Is it her on the oops?! 👀
What the hell did I just listen to? It’s awful Beyoncé needs to stick with her pop music.
What the hell is the garbage 😩😩
Why is she naked ?
Anyone noticed that this video starts playing from the 22nd second when you press play.? What a trick to increase views knowing views count from the 15th second. Isn’t this cheating ?
Country album....overdue or right on time? Hmm.
Lord is this porn or music? Music definitely has changed.
Anyone else mute the song and get busy? I mean its kinda country but i didnt hear one line about a truck or sister or god.
Why is she naked ?
Did my video have a glitch? It was the same thing over and over for the whole thing 🤷🏼‍♀️
Where’s her bra?
When is she going to put clothes on?
She sing really good but why she's always almost naked ?
Does she have to be so sensual with every thing?
Is there nothing this woman cant do?😭😍
This and 16 CARRIAGES videos seem lazy to me, neither song sounds country, carries a narrative, or brings her talent out.
Great music but wtf is this video
Does she know how to play the guitar .... like  it would be fire if she could while performing the songs 😂
Is this really the music video? Or is it not done?
Why does she have to be half naked?
Song is ok but why can she & others put some clothes on?
When she gonna do Funk? Disco 🪩? Gospel? Return to R&B? Those genres really need her!
Button your top up so you dont look trashy and indecent. Didnt your momma raise you up to act better than that???
What is this shit?
What’s wrong with her? She’s a talented woman so there is no need to dress like that 😢
Wtf is this? This sounds nothing like Country!  I understand why they not playing this shit on the radio.
I love me some of my queen... But what the hell is this?😂😂...I'ma act like I didn't hear this, and assume this is a mistake
Did she ask permission to Dolly before doing this?😂
How can Beyoncé experience racism it’s unimaginable I mean she’s Beyoncé 🥺
Why is the walk on repeat?
I dunno about this one 😅
What the hell was this?
Is this a joke? I'm bad at sarcasm.
She got the worst voice ever , why she famous ?
Wtf is this
Why does this remind of Jessica Simpson, boots made for walking, lol?
Where are 'em nipples
Tacky outfit. Why?!?
Very interesting no offense but she has an r&b voice how can she pull a who 360 and change genres. Not sure about this 1 but all the best. Good luck.
Why doesnt she put clothes on? First song of hers I like.
Great video, the same 5 seconds over and over. WTF?
When do Beyoncé and Lady Gaga get together for another telephone?!
So being naked every chance you get is what you call authentic black country? This song without any message or depth, generic Beyonce music.. impresses a lot of naive people out there. Thanks, I prefer real country.
Why no shirt?
Idk how J-z is ok with her wearing small pieces of clothing like what dose blue have to say to that ? We all saw how north west reacted to Kim’s outfit
wtf is this?  you can tell she is desperate so trying something different but no
wow, this is so bad and i love country, my question is why?
Wth is this
Ok so what’s with this video ? It’s kinda blah .
Why does she have her jugs out?
Whooo is she aiming them shots at Nicki!
Love the music but why the nakedness? #Distraction.
What’s on her eye ?
I wonder if the CMAs are they going to treat her like lil Nas X
Does anyone know why some country music stations are rejecting this song? It  sounds more country than some country songs released in recent times.
Why does she have to be so naked??? She can sing, dance, writes etc. She has no need to
Where do I find a book to bet on this winning album of the year?!
What is she trying to be? Not country music
Only 2 million views in 24 hours?
Is this why she looks so white
I thought it was a music video, it’s just the same 5 second clip repeating on a loop ? Song is cute, but I don’t really like country
Wtf did i just watch
Texas hold em? Hold her jugs?
What genre can Bey NOT sang? ...not 'Nan.... she's MULTI-TALENTED at MULTI-TASKING 💛
Wack, ask a country music fan if they like this. Easy $ for mediocre sound. Garbage...
Has she just ran out of stuff to do?? I love Bey, but this isn’t it for her imo.
Three amazing children and her body looks that perfect... My mother said my sister took away her nice boobs..... What's Bey secret to keeping hers pefect.....
What??
Why is she white
Woke people, please explain to me, Beyoncé showing half of her boobs is that a woman being free to do whatever she wants with her body, oder is it a matter of cheap old "sex sells"? Btw, this is a serious question. She doesn't need that
Something wrong with her?
Is she trying to mess w/ Taylor Swift?🤔
Why's her chest flickering in the close-up
I didn't watch the game did SHE Takeover another Super Bowl? 😮🙄😳😄😅😂🤣
Why wait after the Super Bowl to release this?🤔
When is the album out
What the actual fck???
Country??    I did not see that coming…
Cowboy hats anyone?!
Girl can you come back to r&b please we need u 😭😭 the rap girlies have taken over and all we have is muni long & H.e.r. Isn’t consistent enough for me .
is this so she can go #1 on the country charts and not have to compete with taylor swift?
She can't win album of the year, so she changes genre?
nah what is this
Not me tapping my feet damnit where is my hat
Is this a joke lol
So whose going to create the line dance for this?? Wake it up! 👀😂
if this is considered country classical music is considered rap
2024 In TEXAS??
Isn't the Renaissance album a 3 disc album cause this all could be from the second disc of the same album. Just a theory.
Beyoncé representing San Marino at Eurovision Song Contest in Malmö with this song.... how do we make that happen???
So when’s the Orville Peck collab?
Now, where are the last photos from the final 3 shows of the Renaissance tour? THIS IS SO LIT! SHES BREAKING THE INTERNET YET AGAIN! AND DURING THE SUPER BOWL!
What the hell is she wearing?
I’m thinking of the writing process, and Beyoncé is probably like “what’s a dive bar?” She doesn’t say it out loud, just thinks it as to not anger her handlers
What the hell is this?
I wonder if she will win album of the year now 😂😂😂
I just wanna know when the dance drop 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Nervous to ask darling was that blue ivy on them vocals?
What corner is she working on
Why am I having to look at titties for a country song?
Beyonce can you do a country project with Chapel Hart????  Who made the cowboy hat Beyonce wore to the Grammys? I want one!
Its a good song but why does she think she has to be half dressed to sell it??
This is a joke? Right?
What CANT Be do?!😊
She looks white or is it me?
Is that Rhiannon Giddens playing banjo!? LOVE HER.
Do you believe these guys ?
Wait hold on a minute
Have you seen this kind of thing before ?
Is she oo
WTF??????? Ok song, but the video?
Pop ur lexus? Is this music solely for the upper class now Beyonce? Hate that shit. What is this an add for the rich?
How can be home for months
So people still thinking she ain’t a fraud ? just a coincidence she is jumping on country music ? 😂
Ok so just like 16 carriages this is brilliantly produced, sung and “curated” by her or by her team but if this is Bey reappropriating country music, the fact that both those songs were actually written by white artists (here Elizabeth Lowell Boland and Megan Bülow) is puzzling.
Why did she bother to wear clothes??
People are fighting me for what? Do I fiight back?
Is this Beyonce tryna take over Taylor's forsaken territory? Lol
When did you become country? Btw it’s so good
Why should we see her boobs?
Wtf is this looped bullshit?🙄
Did this video cost about £10 to put together? Just standing on a black floor with a black background?
I only like The Everly Brothers so I'm curious about this I'm guessing a kind of RnB country.
Who's listening here from the Philippines?
Is there anything this woman can’t do???❤🐝
Lady Gaga collab when???????????????😢
Next feature with jelly roll?  Luke combs??   Morgan wallen???
Remember Daddy Lessons?
Ok but why do we need to see her almost half naked?
I wonder if Pharrell knew anything about this that’s why his Louis Vuitton line was Texas theme
Is anyone else hoping that she will do a part two of telephone with Lady Gaga since they’re both going through their country music career. imagine 2024. That’ll be amazing.
Has anyone noticed the silver cobra on her glasses? Hmm.
What's with artists going country all of a sudden❔❓ Austin Mahone just put out country music not long ago as well❕❗
How many country bars she's been in how many card games has she played with out having a million in the bank.
You got the dance ready Bey???

Why do people forget she is from Texas
What the hell was that?
Am I the only one at home making up my own line dance RIGHT NOW!!!!😊😊😊
Where did she find the time to make new music, the tour only finished a few months ago?
Mother? Genre queen? Volatile Queen mother? Yee HAWW
Was lady gaga right all this time and we didn't see it at that time?
Is she trying to shift to taylor's genre 🤔 i don't mean it in a negative way.  I'm unexpectedly amazed!  🔥🤌😍
what in the redneck hell?
Dolly parton is hanging her head in dismay...this is nice but sounds like an experiment and just fun for B.
Where is the line dance Queen?????? We ready!!! ❤🤠🤠🤠🎊🎉🎊  As a black woman that was raised on country music I’m here for this! #Beyonce #MickeyGuyton
Why does she have to be half naked. Let the singing speak for it self which is good by the way
Wait why this eating
I don’t know but WTF is going on with Beyoncé music lately, I use to love Beyoncé music but lately I feel disconnected from it.
I’m confused. A singer or a topless dancer?
Who's making the line dance for this? 📢NOT whoever made the Tamia line dance! 🙄
tell my why I'm slowly being initiated into the beyhive
Why is dressed liked that?  Totally pathetic to say the least!  Peace
How will she perform country live with a rnb catolong?
Why is she announcing new music? Like.. before she dropped it before a announcement. What is different?
Taylor Swift who?
Now Im just wondering whst song ill be picking to play on repeat in the 🚗 as i ride once the album is here
Reminds me of Madonna Don't Tell Me song.

Wonder did she write this????
All I wanna know is will you be at the rodeo??

THEM : Who is your favourite country artist ?  Me : Beyonce !!!  🎉🎉🎉🎉
I wonder if Bey & K-Michelle will make a song together this round.
What is this...  😭😭😭😭😭😭
Is there ANYTHING this woman can't do? Beyoncé give us a chance to breathe PLS
Another world tour this year?
Wait a minute....are we getting another album....a COUNTRY album?🥳🥳😭
Is it so hard to just give a proper visual to the music?
She really looks like she’s mixed with Mexican … never know since Texas was Mexico and ancestors are native
Could anyone please clarify the situation? Has she released a new album?
Makes me wonder what act iii will be— possible ballads?! I’m living for this!
I'm now a country music fan. Now, where can I learn to line dance?
I woke up to go to gym. Is it okay if I skip the chest day because I came upon this video and her verizon commercial?
Is it me or anyone else whos getting tired of nakes bodies?
Sup EXCELLENT SONG.  Can someone help answer - What is actually a woman? Asking for a friend.  Thanks!
Is there a genre she cannot do?? Wow this sounds like she’s been doing country her whole career.
Act II drops next month? I can't wait
Is this the start of a new album or just a few new singles she's releasing? Beyhive megafans, I'm asking you....
I'm rocking to this!!🎉 As usual she commands the charts and keeps us guessing like what's next??❤❤❤
Hold on is Beyoncé gonna make me start liking country music ???
Am I the only one that’s hearing rumi at the end of the song?
Way too sleazy.  Why does she need to resort to this?

Does everything have to be nude?? That kind of talent doesn’t have to stoop to that!  I’d like the little kids to hear and see this but it sure ain’t P-G!  It’s a shame!
What's this, a new álbum?
I heard her next album is going to be a country album... thoughts?
What’s up with the same visual over and over again😅 very inappropriate for a 42 year old with 3 kids to walk out like that.. where the nipples went? In your armpits?😂
So was the plan to release the song immediately following Super Bowl? Not planning for Super Bowl to go into overtime I take it lol
Does anybody wear clothes anymore??
How are there more like than views?
Country music?
When are these tracks dropping on Apple Music?
I wouldn’t know if this is a good country song or not bc it’s not my thing but this didn’t do it for me personally.

Why is this one taking VIRGO'S GROOVE as her best song, Beyoncé keeps on upgrading artistically
