i keep wonderinghow brienne comes from them. is selwyn somehow decdnded from themor her mother..neither dunk or tansellle arenobles
What house does ser Duncan belong to
Only a half hour per episode? Almost feels like they are rushing this just to get eyeballs
Yo are we all just going to ignore that image in the first 20 secs 😭😭😭
Why tf is Dunk so small?  They really couldn’t have gotten someone even close to his size to play him?
7:50 Ugh, so you mean this story is incomplete too?
So Charlie, is this about 50-100 years before GoT?
I don't know why they skip blackfyre rebellion?
Did he even finish the last book of game of thrones
Why doesn't George hire a team of writers giving them the main plot points to finish WOW and just edit it to his approval?
Anyone know where I can get cryogenically frozen until all the game of thrones books and shows have been released so that I don’t have to wait years and years to watch it all
Excuse me m’lord @EmergencyAwesome but how does one acquire the shirt you are wearing?
When will HBO make Aegon’s Conquest story and the story before that of Valeria , more houses that had dragons
Do you think they’ll go through years up to Summer Hall?
You need some outside influence protection with the Magneto mask? :) :D
no intro music?   I NEED to hear the song before any GoT related episodes....😅
idk why hbo dont just make a series start at aegon conquest and ends with robert rebellion. the hotd maybe stop at aegon 3rd coronation.
In the Seven Kingdoms there seems to be questions with everyone's parentage...
This will kind of be a standalone show, right?  I get so confused about all the lineage. How many Aegons were there anyway?   I mean, am I supposed to remember all the lore to enjoy this?
But will there be White Walkers?
Been staring at that picture looking for any clues to this season
Is ma man Scotch/Irish?!
