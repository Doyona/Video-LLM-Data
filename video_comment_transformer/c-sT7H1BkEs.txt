Valentine’s Day, wedding plans, home makeover, and... baby #3? Are you playing life on HARD mode? 😆 Wishing you luck and make sure to stay healthy—this level is intense! 😆
Hi Zoe, would you be able to please do a spring clothing haul!? PS… you are stunning!
I’m currently pregnant with my first baby!! I would love a video about your delivery experiences because my anxiety about giving birth is starting to kick in😂🤍
What is this Camera?
Yes please do birth stories! Also cannot imagine how irritating it is to constantly have people ask if you’re having another baby. People were asking my friend that question within a month of her giving birth.
I have two daughters too, 10 & 8 and I still feel lost and not myself. I can’t even remember who I used to be before children 😢 Do we ever find ourselves again? 💔
Hello zoe! Could you please let is know where you got your ‘Z’ charm necklace from?
Guyssss, doesn’t Zoe look like Ellen Pompeo (Meredith Grey) in the thumbnail!?!? Is it just meeee????
She’s back❤❤ What is your pancake recipe please Love all the flowers.
The question about how to find yourself again when you don't know who you are anymore hit so hard. 2 years ago I ended a 12 year relationship. We were together all of my 20's and I feel so lost now at 35. I lost myself at the end of that relationship and now I don't know who I am anymore. I am alone, no kids and just feel really lost. But I am taking small steps in finding myself again, trying to see it in a more positive way. Like you said just trying to do things I know I enjoy and try new things. Decorate my home as I want it without having to think about someone elses opinions. Yeah just taking it slow and small steps at a time.
please do a video on birth! im 25 and not a mum but i am thinking about it and the thing scaring me most is birth
Could you do a video on your routine and how you get the girls to sleep please? ❤
Zoe here just looks so differentttt in a good way but I can’t point out what it is🤣   Maybe it’s the hair making her face look fuller? 😍😍😍😍  sooooooo prettyyyyy
Are the personality traits a 1st child and 2nd child thing? Like are you the older child? Is Novi more like Joe as a second child?
Does anyone know where Zoe’s Z initial necklace is from? 🫶🏼
Please please please do a full c section video! I’m a FTM due in June and I have to have a C section which is grand but I’d love to hear your experience ?
Why don’t you get a wedding mood board on the go and then speak to a wedding planner Zoe 🥰
I've seen a few comments mentioning the new hair is giving Jennifer Aniston (I see it) but for some reason my brain is thinking Ellen Pompeo and that somehow it makes you kinda look like her? Either way, your new hair looks so good and happy to watch another vlog of yours!🤗
How annoying like for years people have asked when are you having baby and now it’s when are you having another it never ends
The gender question is so funny! I have two girls as well, a 4 year old and almost 11 month old, and when I was pregnant with my second people would assume I wanted a boy but actually I wanted another girl. I would’ve been so happy either way, genuinely, but I love having girls and feel so complete 🥰♥️ just feel lucky to be a mummy x
What a beautiful start to a video with the valentines breakfast. Who does Novie get her dimples from? 😊
Don't worry, the awkward questions still happen when you have one of each. I always get 'oh you'll not want anymore then since you have one of each" 😅 my daughter is 12 and my son is 8 and I'm still not 100% sure that I'm done having kids haha. x
The matching pyjamas are ADORABLE 😭 where are they from?🩷
Inquisitive is the word you might have been looking for Zoë
The question you addressed about how to find yourself when you don't know yourself - i find going back to basics, use this page in the book of your life to rewrite or slightly edit. Find a different interest whether that will be solo or with friends or family.
Who is getting married??
Zoe would a wedding planner not help? Or poppy or mark to help you?
