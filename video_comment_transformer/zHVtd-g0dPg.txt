Don't understand one thing, why these young heroes incline towards insane vulgarity, are movies meant only for youngsters? Very bad language used... Less focus on content but more on filthy dialogues.... Title itself is obnoxious... Very sad to see these kind of films in TFI... In fact Nani shouldn't have encouraged profanity in Hit-3....
