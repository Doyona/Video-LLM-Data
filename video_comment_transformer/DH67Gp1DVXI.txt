In America, I think we called that a  mostly peaceful interrogation
Are these the guys responsible for the terrorist attack in Moscow?
How do we know that this is an actual terrorist when Russia has spent a decade prosecuting Jehovah’s Witnesses under similar charges without evidence?  That said , if he actually is a terrorist , I’m glad they got him.
What is he doing sleeping in the court room ?
How could anyone be so stupid to follow an evil satan[Allah], commit such an evil attack in a place like Russia where if your caught, your going to be in a world of hurt?

Why is Russia so dated looking
Are they the terrorists or just the cops wanted to show someone to Putin before he sends them to a Gulag?
They are barely alive. I guess there were no Miranda rights for those guys .... Where are all the human rights activists that are screaming at Israel for detaining Hamas fighters, feeding and clothing them, and providing them with top notch medicall treatment? Why are they not outside this court yelling about human rights violations? One of those guys had his ear cut off by FSB operatives after thry took him in custody for Christ's sake, and no one even uttered a single word of condemnation 🤦🏻🤷. As long as it's not Israel no one gives a crap who's rights and lives are being tarnished.
Miranda Rights...?

Why is always muslims doing these attacks?

Why is Islam the religion of every terrorist? What kind of mentality does this world have? Why doesn't it tell that everyone hates the heavenly book Quran?

Did you ever notice these terrorists always wear the same 1970s workout outfits I see they took care of that one Punk that had the ear infection

Dreaming of Jannah.. but missed "the train" there, or what? 🤔
And they people picked off the street?
Why do Russian cops always have to hide their identity?
Why were the terrorists without masks at the time of the attack? There are cameras everywhere now. This is weird!😮
How did America know about the shooting in the concert hall unless they did it 🙏 they didn't know anything else before 🙏
Are they really the perpetrators or are they victims of Russia’s bullshit? They have a tendency to always accuse people of wrong doing even when nobody is a criminal. Didn’t Putin accuse Jehovah’s Witnesses of being criminals and putting them in prison for no reason and taking their money and places of worship? Anyone can say they are guilty when they beat you and torture them. Putin is not fooling anyone and is looking very stupid.
Why are these guards all wearing masks? If they have any pride in their jobs they would show their faces. Cowards
Aren't they still suspects?
How do we know these aren't some random guys Putin had picked up off the street? I don't believe anything Russia says.
Ear soup???😮
How did they get all 4? Odds of that are astronomical
