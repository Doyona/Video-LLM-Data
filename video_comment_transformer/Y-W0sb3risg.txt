Is West Ham even trying 😢
What about ,the second leg played yesterday? Is super sports not interested in the highlights?
Is the face in his name not pronounced face
Why does the highlights take so long
It's lowlight, not highlight...
Got the wrong opponent huh?😅
Why taking so long to post these highlights
Please explain how can WH play so bad while they have a group of so much talent and experience
who will be next?
so west ham highlights is just 12 second thats it?? 1 shots on target 🤦‍♂
