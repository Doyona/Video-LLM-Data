Wicked spin? There was no spin, hence the unpredictability.
Why was that GK about to yous    his feet
Doesn’t the name knuckleball mean that there is no spin?
I wonder how many goals I’ve yelled at the GK from the TV angle thinking it was easy only to have been harder at a different angle.
What can he do? The wind has changed the course of the ball. I'm sad for him😑
How did he not save that?
Why did he use his feet but not his hands?
Where are his hands?
Why use feeet?
Why in bundesliga dont like defending? Serious question
Whos that?
I guess you mean "spin" as in the change of direction? Weird term to use when the knuckleball effect is due to the lack of spin
This is ridiculous what is that a kids ball
Why were the midfielders yelling at the gk 😂
Forgot he could use his hands or what😂?
What the heck is the GK doing? See the other angle - Oh nevermind.
That is a bend right? Not spin.
This is not a spin, it's a completely spinless shot, which made it so unpredictable, if it had spin, would be a very predictable curve
Doubt a Mitre Max would have done that
Maybe keep your foot on the ground?
Marcus Thuram??? 😮
Whos the striker?
Why was he running back so fast... that just makes the goal bigger. It open up the angle, and complicates diving
Am i only one who thought that song is similar to intro of gta 6
What spin? It was a knuckleball, it literally had no spin, it was the way it moved like a balloon
Is Cristiano the inventory of knuckleball goals ?
Which sport is this?
Why can't he grab the ball with his hand?😅😅😅😅
Was that bonifasee?
Admin can you do that?
