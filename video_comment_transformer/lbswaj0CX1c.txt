Why are these highlights videos so short? Is it a rights issue or something?
I don’t suppose you noticed, or anyone for that matter, certainly not tv or radio, noticed Watkins’ goal was created via 22 passes with every outfield player involved except Rashford, culminating in a one-two with Digne. A truly well worked brilliant move and goal👌
You should show the two goals we scored that were offside.
Why you can block Liverpool like this but can't even beat 10 men Ipswich??
Can we please get proper length highlights. Championship teams do 9/10 minutes. UTV 💜💙

Why is Rashford watching his man score lol
Why does the thumbnail looks like from PS5 ?!!?

Why the hell didn't Rashford track back and mark Trent? He easily could have got to him
