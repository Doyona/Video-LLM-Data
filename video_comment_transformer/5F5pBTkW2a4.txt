Henderson why don’t you call Virgil to come and play at Ajax with you? Henderson the type of player good players need, but the players at Ajax right now won’t be able to handle the type Henderson. He gave passes to Salah and Firminho who understand his style and passes, they run into spaces other players don’t see, and now he will try to pass to players like Berghuis and Bergwijn type of players who didn’t handle the Premier League. I hope he will keep his pleasure to play for this Ajax.😰😰
I've got 2 questions  Why did he go to Ajax? What are his goals with Ajax to achieve?
