She should have given him dome of the info he was asking like, her address at the sherriffs office and her name and title.
Duh what was your first clue captain?  Accent?
When you block these scammers, does that really work?  I had been blocking up to ten scam calls a day, and it seems to be better.
Can't they trace it he call.?
And if that was true, why would the cops call her and tell her that she was going to be arrested, giving her an opportunity to run away or go into hiding 😭✋️
What tables were turned?
Where in the video has she turned the tables on the scammer?
So, when did she tell him she's a cop?
After they say their name 😅keep asking him/her what their Grandmother calls them.  Sends them nuts..😅😅 THEN ask them if their Grandmother is happy with their choice of work  scamming people off their hard earned wages by lying.... 😟🤯 absolutely! 😊
How did she turn the tables exactly?
She is a LEO. Shouldn’t she be trying to investigate this crime?
Why didn't trace the line?
But what if it’s true and u we’re doing drug trafficking
Wonder How Much of The Actual 'Hell' Will Hold Those 'Scammers'!?
Did they even try to trace the call to anywhere like I know that scams aren't worth it but at least the department could do was trace the call to the center and shut it down like we fund the police enough to do investigations like this like did they further anything or just leave it at a prank call that should be mocked
Just turn the tables and ask the scammer the scamming questions 😂
Also never say the words “yes” or “no” they’re prompts and once they have them recorded, game over
Ant you track him?
Well, then — what happened next?
Were they not able to trace the call?
In the end did you tell him whobyou were?  It is fun to mess with them.
Last time she spoke to me on the phone I asked for her SSN very nicely and she just gave it to me. Didn't have to threaten or lie, just asked nicely.
Did you trace the call?
Why didn't they trace the call and arrest him??
Maybe I've watched too much television, but...trace the call? Is that possible?
0:53 Who’s there?
I've had one of these unfortunately but it amazes me how much info they keep asking for (and the lengths they go to to try and get it) even though the caller supposedly has your file. 🙄
So what happened?  Did she follow through with turning this over to the FBI to track them?  Just goes to show that not even true law enforcement aren’t immune to scammers!!!😂😂😂😂
I wonder how long she kept him on the hook before she told him she was a police officer.
Why didn't she use the time to have the call traced?
with that accent ?😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why don't you go further and find out the number and get him arrested????
Why? Couldn't they trace the call?That's kind of weird
India call center?..yeah not gonna have anything to do with that
Couldn't You track the phone call or not?  Give it to the gov dept that takes care of this? LM
I get them to hang up on me by asking them what my name is
why didnt they trace the call
Why didnt they trace his number then tell him his address 😂
What did he dial 911? 😜
When I get phone scammers that call me I pick up the phone and I start asking them inappropriate questions
How about tracking the number and arresting them
where is that demon live?
Not a very good police captain ! Shes kept him on the line for so long but couldnt trace the call ? Its 2024 we can find your mobile / device but cannot trace calls ? 😂😂😂😂😂
I need to be told over the phone that I am being arrested? I thought they would just bust down the door.
When being arrested for drugs I need to be told over the phone? I thought they would just bust down the door
Ask them to hold on and then act like they’ve been transferred to FBI SCAM division! 😂
Is it just me, or the scammer has an Indian accent?
What table was turned
Am I racist or every scamster that people talk to on videos has the same voice? I'm Indian btw.
She should ask him where he would be sending the sheriff deputy to 😅
Scammer sounds Indian??
I wonder if she could have commandeered unused police bandwidth to trace the call and dox the scammer
Why not trace the call & arrest him?
I always ask them extremely perverted questions and then laugh when they get mad. For some reason they don't call back. 😂
So what happened to the scammer??? Finish the story!!! 😤😤😤😤
Why wasn't the  call traced ,??
Why police didn’t try to track the location of this scammer then put them to jail so they cannot scam other people
Can't she get the callers number and track him down? Just thought it was funny!
Can you trace this call and could catch this Indian scammer?
What's the difference when a "cop" does it?
I would like to know why the police asked people for their Social Security number
So did the captain follow up with an investigation and catch these crooks?
And what exactly has to the person making the call???? Nothing???
How about trace the call and go and arrest them?
This could easily be stopped.  Why isn't it stopped?
Why didnt they trace the call? Every call has to be traced. The scammer could be in the US.
How about TRACING THE CALL???  Then arrest THEM!
Wait how do we know if he is a scammer and she not actually trafficking drugs
Did you ever tell him your job position?  I love it. Lol.
I also receive scammer and I will pretend same with them like ask his name rank and which department.
Why couldn't she arrest him?!
Who is filming her? How did they know to film for this?
Did she ever tell him exactly who he was threatening? If she did, he probably didn't believe her, but I'd love to see his face if he realized he had picked on the wrong woman. 😅
Why didn’t she trace the call and have them all và arrested
why did they post this in 2024, this video is from 2019???
I want to know why she didn't put a trace on that call immediately and keep him on the line long enough for them to do what they have to do to get this bastard off of the airwaves and into the prison of hell
Once when I was a young teenager a scammer called me, to tell me my car's extended warranty had run out.  I was to young to even get my license, so I asked them what imagery car they were talking about.
Why couldn’t she have it traced? Probably somewhere in India?
Why can't you trace the call & have the creep arrested?
Can she have him arrested?
Did you notice the scammer's accent?? He is calling from overseas ...
isn't this sort of crime considered to be domestic terrorism?:it should be!!!!!
Is than an accent from the sub-continent? 😂
Turns the tables eh?  Wouldn’t that mean something like having the call traced and the scammer arrested?  Looks to me like she simply didn’t comply with his demands for personal information. I see no table turning here.
I keep wondering why my debt collectors keep sounding they're from newdeli 😂
Safest thing to do: if you don't recognize the number don't answer. If the caller has real business with you they will leave a message and you can call them back. If you get a "fraud alert", call your bank at the number on your card.
Did you at least TRACE THE CALL???
But what if it’s real tho
I kept calling them back ad nauseum and asked how THEY liked it.  Haven't heard from them since.
Why is the man talking over the video ¿ i love this lady
Couldn’t that phone call? Be traced so that these people could get arrested
What's the scam ?
Why not try and track the call?
aren't they allowed to trace that call or do they need more red tape?
Why can't you find them
why not track the scammer while doing some word play with him so he can be arrested if the scammer is just around America
Wasnt this like 5 yrs ago?
Could she have tracked his call? With all the resources at the station, could she have done more than record?
how did she keep it together so well?? if that was me I’d be on the floor cackling too much to talk 😂
Why not give them the address to the local FBI or an address with the police waiting?
Couldn’t she keep him on the line until the FBI got involved?
Was that an indian police officer? Lol
how many more people do you think would be scammed if the scammers didn’t have a strong accent
Its unfortunate how many people fall for things like this. Only advice we can give once you give up your social is contact social security and keep an eye on your credit reporting agencies. As for bank info if its just a debit you can close it as stolen but if its account and routing number you have to close your entire account transfer your money to a new one which can be a pain same proccess as a lost check.
How do they even send police to her location if they don’t even know their location? That’s dumb of the scammer
this is from like 2016 wtf?
If I don't recognize the number, I just say, "County sheriff department, what is the nature of your emergency?" and they always freak out and hang up on me 😂😂😂
dude, this video is like 5 years old or so...and your just now posting it? xd
Why is this important?
Whyd u guys reupload this was like years ago
Why is Inside Edition so late to everything? This happened 5 years ago.
Was this was a long while ago.
