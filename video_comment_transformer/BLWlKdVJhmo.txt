Is no1 else amazed by how that isn’t a pen on van dijk? I’m a Chelsea fan so no bias but that’s a pen all day, I honestly don’t understand the rules anymore
How can he even play a full match with his father kidnapped? It must be hard
No but seriously…HOW IN HOLY HAZELNUTS DID NUNEZ NOT SCORE?!
Did the Liverpool players struggle with luton pitch today?
How does darwin nunez do this. Missing sitters. Scorin worldies
Should have been five up after 60 mins but Liverpool's finishing not the best lately. Klopp maybe should have played 442 instead of 433 to give extra strength in the midfield. Good goal by Diaz - respect for what he is going through.
Correct decision not giving a handball, but not sure why Saliba's against Chelsea was one, then...
Why do Liverpool keep changing their uniform to these weird colours? Liverpool are known as red don’t change that
First time this season.... klopp got it wrong. Why play gomez at left back? Nunez is quality but he is only at his best against teams that come out to play or when they are tierd. Yes Elliott got the assist but no way is he good enough to replace Gravenberch. 2 points dropped here.
So thats not handball but Salibas from 1cm away is? What?
That is one emotional game, don’t know which moment is emotional, Luton nearly winning, or Diaz scoring a equaliser with him showing his support for his missing family on his undershirt.
Did anyone else see Salah’s reaction to Nunez miss 🤣🗿
Don't know why Salah put his hands on his head fur nunes miss, that header was a shot not a pass.
1:32 how did Nunez missed this? 5 years old kid can score this😂😂😂
Nunez has missed about 17 sitters this season, when is the media gonna notice??
Whats the difference between that foul on VVD and the foul on Rodri?
why they dont buy a good striker and they keep nunez?
Did Nunez put on last season's boots or something?
When's Klopp going to read Darwin the riot act? That's too many unforgivable sitters he's missed. Super goal from Luton.
Why Nunez is still playing for Liverpool? Is Klopp blind? 🤬🤬🤬
Spurs only had 10 men and beat Luton???
How many more chances does Nunez want 🤔
Is it me or has salah stopped taking people on? He always looks to pass now .....
Why have they not shown the message on his shirt at the end?
Why is klopp obessessed with the league cup playing a full team against bournemouth instead of resting the first team players was stupid i rather play the young fellows the fixture list is crowded enough .
What is that liverpool away kit
Why dont Luton play like this every week?
Can somebody please tell me the difference between Hojlands grab of the city player last week where a pen was given and the grab on VVD is this game and nothing is given? EXACTLY THE SAME FOUL. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🙄🙄🙄🙄
Who on earth designed Liverpool's away kit? Jesus
What is wrong with Nunez..... Never seen a more inconsistent player one week a wonder strike the next miss of the season. Great fun to watch as a neutral but would be very concerned if I was a Liverpool fan.
Is this their first meeting since that 3rd round FA Cup clash in 2006?
Luton deserved a point but surely that's a penalty?
Can someone tell me why Liverpool got 8 minutes of stoppage time awarded? Seemed like overkill to me...
Anyone know what the make of Rob Edwards' jacket is?
So if rodri being pulled down was a pen why not vvd?
How can Luton not hold a lead for just the last two minutes. Goodness me.
How the hell has Liverpool only managed a draw against a Championship side pretty much
