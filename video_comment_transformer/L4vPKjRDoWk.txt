Danish Officials Question the Source of the Bodies
Morten Messerschmidt, MP and chairman of the People’s Party, asked the Minister of Health questions about ethical issues regarding the body exhibition.
Question 275: “Can you explain what permits and legal procedures are required for the exhibition of human remains in Denmark and whether the exhibition of human remains complies with applicable laws?”
Question 276: “Can the Minister explain how the use of human remains in exhibitions should ensure the consent of the deceased or their relatives? “
Question No. 278: “Will the Minister investigate whether he is aware of similar exhibitions of human bodies internationally that are related to lack of consent or illegal trade, and whether the Minister will investigate human bodies in this regard? In this context, is the Minister aware of China’s use of organs from political prisoners?”
Søren Espersen, a senior member of the Danish Democratic Party, asked the Minister of Culture about the bodies.
“The exhibition has been criticized in several places because of doubts that the bodies were not all donated voluntarily and for a clear purpose,” Thomas Krarup, director of health, culture and care in the city of Randers, wrote in a notification to government authorities.
