He legit just pushed her no seen of her hitting her head or her falling in the pool what is going on Hollyoaka
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it both romeo and prince's fault? I mean she had?a head injury from Prince so when romeo pushed her off him n she went in the pool  her injury was to much ? It was a head injury wasn't it ? Confused lol
Really? This looong drawn out who done it story ended with the obvious person to kill her? what a waste. We all said Romeo from the get go.
Seriously?
Ugh is that it? Dragged on far too long
How exactly did she drown when she went into the pool? Did she hit her head before she went in? Obviously she can swim so it couldn't have been her not knowing how to swim.
How is Prince trying to take a morale high ground here when his been trying throw Perri under the bus from the get go
Ahhh who beat him up and chucked him in the van?
It was an accident!? 🙄
How’s the glasses cam getting different angles
It’s always the lover unless there more to it? But how there can’t be she was in the pool
Ok, so Peri, Hunter AND Romeo all kept things from their friends and the police. But Romeo can't be charged for murder. Rayne was going nuts on him and he pushed her back. Isn't that self-defense? Also, even if it's not, it's manslaughter at best. I know that's not good either, but it's not murder.
Also how did she even die like did she drown cause the pool looked shallow
I haven’t watched this show in a couple of weeks, but wasn’t the killer already revealed ?
