Why is it called iOS26 as being released in 2025 would have thought it would be iOS25
Is there any change regarding multitasking? Any split view? Any slide over?
Yawn. How about a more intuitive keyboard and number row? Something ALL users would benefit from multiple times a day.
what about battery 😂😂 battery would drain like nothing
Wait, what year is it?
I can’t Make up my mind, which one I’m impressed with more the eye candy or  all  the yet to be discovered bugs🎉
No iPhone 17 announcement??
So they wanted it to look like a cheap third party Android launcher from 2017?
All they did was make em transparent? Y’all are acting like they did something crazy lol we had this back in the day during the jailbreak Cydia days
How about android 26..-used phone android 😮
Some of these features have been on android for years. Why do people bother anymore
Remember when Windows 7 had a transparent UI? 🤌
Will it be available on an iPhone 15?
So it's windows aero? From Windows 7?
How do we do the messages background
I never signed up for the developer beta only the public beta but im able to download ios 26 ?  Maybe they are the same thing
Looks useless where is functionality
I was really excited for delivery on a better operating system for the iPad, making it more of a computer like experience. I didn't see that in the video. Did that get done or did that not happen? Pretty disappointing if they did not do that.
What about round icons
I have and Se and I'm not sure whether I should get it due to the fact that all the ui changes aren't made for that type of model (with homebutton)
Wait... Why's it called iOS 26?
Am I risking something if i update to the beta? And will the battery be worse ?
Still No split screen? 😔
What happened to the previous ones
Will we be able to closse all tabs not slide each one?
Just slight visual tweaks. How is this as big as IOS 7’s update, it’s not even close
Why is the design illegible in places and terribly overshadowed? Otherwise it looks interesting.
since when did we get to ios 26?
I'll wait to see if Apple steps up the game with the iPhone 20. iPhone 12 is still serving the purpose.
I want to get the iPhone 17 Pro and how is the new iOS supposed to save the iPhone 17 series the 17  should sell well because most people skipped the 16
all that redesign and still the same ass keyboard..... is it too much for apple to just make a full feature keyboard with a number row and ,  and . on the main panel like gboard so you can type with less taps.... I dont understand how its so hard for them
Has the “Books” app been refreshed? I use it a lot and I kind of want to see how it looks like now.
I hate that time expanding crap on the lock screen, can I turn that off?
Where are the round icons Apple and what happened to the home OS !!!??
Why did they jump to 26?!😂
So no round icons?
No split screen?
Só are we Devs accounts get the ios 26 today?
How did bro uplaod this so quick!!
It’s the macOS clipboard manager coming to iOS too ??
I watched it when does it kick off?
I watched it when does it kick off?
Will iOS 26 come to iphone 17 base model or will the baseodel run on iOS 18?
Bro when did you shoot and edit this? You posted before the stream ended 😅
