Ad avg 3 pts in the last 4 - 4th quarters. Injury??? Lol he was using that arm in the 4th to defend, so pls. Plus Murray had a strained calf. And are you serious?  They had to take ad to the locker room???  Did they give ad quick shoulder surgery, too??? Lmao
Keyshawn are you for real, son? Lbj rages that he didn't challenge! So what you want him to do in that situation in an elimination game. Btw, y'all lost that challenge. It was a foul
what's with the random microphone at 5:35 ??
Jokic gets 20 boards and never gets fouled?  Amazin!
Why Skip all of a sudden start to defend LeBron queen?
Keyshawn is talking nonsense. Who's the idiot put him on this show?
Has Keyshawn played a pickup basketball game ever? Like at 19:30, how does he know whether that impacted the shot or not? He seems to be guessing, with a lot of confidence.
Explain how you lose a timeout when u won the challenge? Nobody's talking about it.
Coach Malone knew all along Murray will play.   Murray being questionable was a psychological tactic. 🤓
Is that Zion's long lost brother?😳😅
Why is there such bias in this show? May as well be a Lakers show.
The challenge rule needs tweaking. If a challenge is good, why shd I loose a timeout????  Loosening a timeout wld seem fair if only it was wrong? But if it's right, then why shd I be penalized for wht the Refs Missed??!?!?!??
People still watch this show? 😂
What's wrong Keychump did Murray make you swallow your words?
Was Keysean laughing when Skip mentioned the wheel chair?? 😅
Did anyone mention Jokic? Listening for 8 minutes now
idc who or what happened letrash James is eliminated!
They act like they won the chip??? 😂
wait.. if they are banging shoulder to shoulder every play, then that would mean the nba is actually physical now? because all the haters say theres no contact or defense lol
Best intro song right now. Also, can Keyshawn be replaced with Rachel when it comes to basketball talk
Do I really want to listen to biased clown Lakers fans bemoaning how Lakers might have won if, if, if, IF . . .!!!!!
does LeHairline still think he's the GOAT? haha
Darvin ham needs to go How do you just let Murray dribble out the clock and get into a shot You double team him set a trap something man but 2 game winners Blown leads He sucks
Lakers had no answer for Murray the entire series
Hey guys. Now that the LA Lakers are out of the playoffs, I wonder how will the viewership for the remainder of the playoffs. Any predictions guys?
Is there a full version of Lil waynee undisputed song?
Why not just foul let Denver shoot  so the Lakers can have time left … tie it up go to OT and battle it out…
So in season tournament doesn't mean much
Isn't it interesting whenever they are talking about the Lakers taking a game winning shot at the end, its usually not about LeBron taking it?
didn't Davis the other game go scoreless in the 4th and he wasn't hurt at all!
Does anybody see the similarities between the Eagles last season and the Nuggets this playoff run? They win but everyone keeps saying “they haven’t played their best yet”. 🍎 to 🍊?
Still why was A D asking for the ball
When Bron was taking his FTs to tie the game LA subbed in Prince for DLO to play D.  They should've subbed in Vando for Reaves there to play D on Murray.  Vando was available to play yet didn't see any minutes.
Still why do LeBron James U C train 🚂 James U Do it n ur Hall of Famer 😊
Why is Skip acting like he wanted the Lakers to win?
No mention of how LeBron walked off, no hand shake?
Still do u believe the Miami heat will not sign a players? U will C
Still this debate Interesting but the sponsor here to stop with fox sports n u C little Wayne aaaasaahhhhhhh will be there to back the show come on now my friend Chad Johnson will see say let the boys do there Job ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bro why not take ad out if he has only use of one arm lol don't make sense
I don’t understand why you don’t keep your timeout when winning a challenge. If they’re gonna take something from the NFL get it right! Makes zero sense you don’t get that timeout back. I agree you should only get 2 challenges if the 1st one is successful
Do Paul and Key got beef with each other?
why is Paul Pierce even on TV?
Why is it green? 😂😂 pierce wildin.
why do we dont see the play?
5:34 What’s with the random shot of the microphone ?😂👀🎤🎙️
And Keyshawn, why was AD nowhere to be seen in at least 3 games second half? Was he injured or was his buddy the "i always make the best play" point guard not playing him while orchestrating lakers' offense?
So how many times does this make that the self described GOAT has been eliminated from the playoffs? How many times beaten or swept from the finals? Yeah it's tough to be the "GOAT".  He's among the greats no doubt. But the GOAT? Not so much!
Any other team?? No, they were not beating the Wolves. Maybe OKC. Probably not even Dallas.
Where was Christian Wood?  He was available to play.  Lakers were outcoached again.
Is it either me or are these guys not only overrating the Lakers but absolutely dissing Denver.
Any other team?? Lol they would have been destroyed by the Timberwolves, Thunder, Celtics, Knicks...
Paul Pierce's Wheel Chair Game? 😂
What is that opening 🏴‍☠️
Joker comit a lot of fouls that do not get called.  Raises questions.
What is that? 5:34
I’m just here to see if Skip acknowledges that Lebron made both critical free throws at the end of the
Bron Lost so much that everyone brought up all the “ what if’s “
What happened to Sherm? Is he only for football season?
Does Paul not realize that there are different grades of calf strains? Should we tell him guys? 😂
Paul doesn't remember being carried off the court with a fake injury 😂😂😂😂😂
Lakers challenged the call because Baby 23 might cry again... thus no more timeouts. 😆
How can Skip not know that Paul Pierce accidentally pooped and pretended to be injured so can clean himself up in the bathroom.  You could see Keyshawn laughing. Paul Pierce keeping a straight face is hilarious!!  He admitted it himself long ago. lol.
Is that true keyshawn was rooting for murray to get hurt? 🤔 key aint like that right?
Did Lebron even play good this series?
Is AD really that soft???
Why does Keyshawn dress like a substitute teacher? Sleeves are not long enough, half the time shirt isn’t tucked in
Who's going to guard antman?
OKC is the youngest team in NBA history to sweep a team in the first round... plus, they beat Denver 3 in a row... how come that's not the topic..
You can’t just say if the lakers would of played any other team they would of won we don’t know that nothing guaranteed in the nba!
Was he really hurt tho?
Where is that Joke Keyshawn? His take yesterday was asinine and pathetic from a so-called sports analysis.
