Without giving final results how can go to second round
While keep pending in other areas results these guys counting for the second opinion votes ??
Whete is the pending results ?? There is clear clue something going underthe table as tactful move
What is the total vote they have taken. Why you can't tell total what they have taken
Rathnayaka. Until all seats are counted, why go for preferences? How do u know if no one has 50% before counting other seats?
Have they published the results of all countings ?
Western province results?
Where is ur all island results??????
