Is this acting or her real ex? Her performance made me cry

Could u please added English Subtitles?
Can someone kindly explain what this MV is about? It's all over my TikTok and seems so heart-wrenching, but I don’t quite understand the context. Also, I used to be a fan of P’Sunny, it’s been so long since I last saw him 😭
Request for extebed version ครับ เป็น shortfilm ก็ได้
The actors are great. Are they exes?   Reminds of a youtube show where they put ex couples and just stare at each other for a few mins. Lovely scene
Why why .. tears 😭 of the happiness
Can someone tell me whats happening in the MV? I really like the song ❤️
