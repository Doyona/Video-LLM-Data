Hello, I already picked intrest in you but how can we get in touch?
My question is why didn't the police arrest them? 😂
Who is in charge of this country?
Abawuturwa means what?
Why did arrest a soldier that has brought a suspect
The issue is omarra's death they know what killed him
But how can the entire police station miss to have security cameras?
What is the root cause of this! Please tell us.
But what kind of impunity is this?
Which police is this who didn't have bullets to shoot
These are issues for the generals, they are beyond my understanding
This makes me laugh coz all of them are armed so what picture are you giving us
Has anyone claimed responsibility for the attack?
Are we heading towards a state of anarchy?
but is this still a country!!!!
Now where should people get juatice and feom whom 🤦🏼‍♂️🥱🥱🤔🤔🤔
Omg what was there intentions
Which party of Documentary is that????!!!
Where is Muzeeyi Bosco??
Can't police leave SFC to do everythg and police closes up states for them
