Why do so many England fans at the Andorra game have their faces painted like mini roundabouts?.
England for years now end up playing the usual suspects in world cup qualifiers, countries like this should be playing in a far less qualifying group than the top table as no one wins and why do England get tied with crap countries in the first place
Why can’t we just be supportive of our team for once? No matter how we perform you always have every England fan hating on our team, may not have been a great match but it’s qualifiers… not a World Cup final.
How have you managed to turn this into a 10 minute video?

Highlights? What highlights? I watched half of this game & I didn't see any highlights, it was the usual dross from England, I wasn't going to watch it at all, i wish i hadn't,that's 45 minutes of my life I'll never get back!

Sorry, So the future of English football in the midfield....is Henderson? I could go out to the leagues, starting premiership and below and find "100" better midfielders than Henderson. I don't blame Henderson. This manager has already proven he can't motivate these players.

I get that this is basically a friendly, but i though tuchel was brought in to make England more exciting? I suppose id still rather secure wins than lose 5-4 in a quarter final
That's the challenge. How to make over paid tossers actually care about winning......
What highlights?
10 mins for 1 goal??
Who else is here before this blows up
How are the highlights over 9 minutes? 30 seconds would have covered it 😉#uttershite
Highlights??
Avalanche of goals?
Highlights? What highlights?
9 minutes of highlights? Really?
How on earth did you find 9mins 53secs of highlights from this boring dross ?
How can you make 9 minute highlights from this boring game 😂
Not sure if highlights is the right word.
How can you put up 10 mins of highlights, 10 secs would do, England were Garbage, ( as usual )
Come on what we scapegoating now foden wasn’t playing???
How have you got 10 minutes of highlights from this? Just because it’s England doesn’t mean it’s worth watching.
Whats with the turtlenecks
I only hear about Andorra when they play football. Does anybody know where this country is? What language do they speak 😅
What are english players combined weekly wages ?
Suprised anyone could make any highlights of that game
How did they find 10 minutes worth of highlights lol. Watching paint dry was more thrilling 😅
Whys this german turning us into the Chelsea B team
How we got 9 mins of `Highlights` out of that ITV is beyond me.? That was spectacularly awful.
Why do they play henderson still? unusual.
When will us English realise we are not world class compared to Spain,France we are mediocre
What is the point of Andorra football wise?.
How can this be an english side anymore? They're mostly african now lol...
Why is Henderson playing
Why bring Gibs White on for only 2 mins?   He's a team player!....
What highlights?,I’ve never saw any.
Highlights?  Shouldn't this video be 25 seconds long?
Do I dare watch these 10 minutes?
how can they drag this match to nearly 10 minutes is my biggest concern
90% of the time the ball went forward to rogers he played it back again. was he scared of taking on mighty andorran left back? And why even bother with us having a left back and right back, they never got forward.
Why was Henderson playing? Tuchel is Southgate continuation.....
Where were the highlights?
A cure for insomniacs?! Watch this game & if that fails watch the Spurs v Man utd Europa League Final.🥱😴
Where’s Southgate to blame??
Does it really matter? 3 points does.
Different manager same rubbish with team selection. Why is Henderson playing? And why did we have a right back at left back when you've got Miles Lewis Skelly, who has played so well all season?
We’re there really 9 minutes of highlights?
Wait? There were highlights?!
Can someone tell me what happened to saka and why Trent didn’t start and why Henderson started like I’d rather play skelly in midfield
You found 9:52 of highlights?
How did Madueke  miss that !
No consistency in the lineups and Jordan Henderson? Really?......they are supposed to ptogress, no regress.
Wtf was that staring lineup
What’s the excuse now that foden isn’t in the team? Obviously people treat him as a scapegoat cause it’s easy
Henderson? Why? Tuchel has got to go, the guy doesn't give a 💩if we qualify or not 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
PPPFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTT.😂  it's just soooooo predictable. Flatter to deceive at the start, and totally flatter to deceive when it really counts. The question is: why do people even bother ? These people are worshipped, put on pedestals, paid fortunes the rest of us can only dream of, and yet, put them up against little more than a pub team, and.
Weird team selection... James as LB?! Jones as RB?! If he wanted an inverted RB then why not play Trent there cos Jones looked uncomfortable in that position. Rogers, Palmer, Kane and Bellingham all wanting to play the 10 and getting in each other's way... baffling why Bowen was left at home, he's the type of winger needed for these types of games.
There are highlights? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why are Andorra wearing scarves?
Apart from not losing against Andorra, I want to hear Thomas Tuchel name one positive point to come out of this game. I’ll give him a month to answer.
How did they get 9 minutes from this😂 also only cole palmer would wear an under armour and then role the sleeves up
