You answered all my questions except for one, how long do I wait for the paint to dry?
My biggest problem when trying watercolours is that I can’t get colours to blend and/or the water on the page will dry up before I’ve even finished a few strokes with my brush. I also can’t seem to stop the page from crimping even with masking tape to hold it down. Is this because of the paper I’m using, the brush, or the watercolours? I don’t really have a lot of money or space for expensive stuff so it’s all very basic at the moment. Should I consider getting better supplies when I can??
Cloe is that you?
Couldn't you just use water to lighten the colour, rather than white? My teacher always told it me it's bad to use white because it makes the colour pasty rather than juicy.
what brushes do you use???
Please make a tutorial on painting hair...
How can you paint perfectly?!!??
*watches video intently* *glances away for a sec* *painting already done* ?????
I'd really appreciate your advice on painting thin semiopaque material, such as a veil over hair or a shroud.
hallo how many layers do you need before it is a  perfect face ???  Thank you for this video i find it`s helpful
Do you dry your work with a heat tool or hair drier or do you just wait it out?
Do you understand Dutch by any chance??
it is 10:34pm and I'm trying to think if it's butterfly effect or affect     thanks brain
All the waiting for the layers to dry would surely take a very long time? And a hell of a lot of patience!
I don't get how the paint doesn't move when it's dried doesn't water colour react to water? Also, what kind of pencil did you use, at first I thought charcoal or graphite but then I though water colour pencils. Other than that thus was very helpful.
Yes what acrylic medium are you referencing for the foundation?
I tried this technique and it did not work at all. As soon as I put water on even after it was dried it lifted and all mixed together, no matter how lighly I touched the surface with my brush. I used professional watercolors and 140 lb paper. I must be missing a step. Are you sealing it in between? Also my pencil sketch smeared into the watercolor too, what do you recommend to fix that issue. What should we use to sketch our drawing for watercolor that won't dissolve?  Thanks!!!!
do you wonder trying copics marker to make semi realism girl digital looking? NOW I CHALLENGE YOU

thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you so much ! this will help me sooooo much ( and I know I am not the only one)  ... I am just wondering... what do you do while you let the paper dry?... just waiting or doing something else.... because I sometimes spoil my drawing because I am too impatient and I don't let it draw enough... - - '

which pepar use in water color
do you use digital painting first every time?
i just wandering.. why his channel related to "yaoi watercolour tutorial" :))) any fujoshi and fudanshi overhere?
hmm...i wonder, why don´t you just add clear water instead of white to lighten up the skintone? in my experience white pigments in watercolors often kills the luminosity of the Colors and also make it hard to layer over it with darker Colors (for example: shadows) Also, there is the white of the paper, why not using it when it´s possible ;) anyways, great tutorial. love from Munich, Ira
