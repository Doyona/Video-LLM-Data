Hi, looks delicious!  Can this recipe be doubled without compromise to the final product?  Thnx

Aren't you working that dough to much? You will develop the gluten and you don't want that...
Can I do this in my food processor on pulse? I do my dough in it
can I use regular milk instead of buttermilk???
I love baking--and biscuits--but mine never come out too well, so I just stick with Bisquick. But I'd rather have homemade. I had a girlfriend show me 20 years ago how she made 'em--flour, lard, buttermilk, they came out high & flaky, but she didn't measure. And I never found out if she used self-rising flour or not. If your flour is self-rising, do you have to add the baking powder? The kind of flour used in this video was not mentioned. I'd really like to know, as I want to perfect my biscuits. I just love those things any time of day!
How does buttermilk biscuit taste like? Ive never eat them :-( i have dome buttermilk in the refridgerator now
Jason, I love your cooking! I was curious if you'd be interested in featuring a gluten free spot every now and then? I'd love to see what you come up with!
Any substitute for shortening?
couldnt you use that leftover buttermilk on top instead?
