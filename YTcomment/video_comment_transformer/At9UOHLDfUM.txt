Hi, Claudia! I just found your channel and subbed. I love your recipes!   I have a quick question though. I noticed that for some of your recipes, you use chicken with the skin on. My family doesn't eat with the skin on. So, can I still make it without the skin?
Claudia how are u ?looks so good .My guy is gonna get a kick out if this.
Would the cooking time vary if I used chicken thighs instead?
You did it again, how do you do it? This looks amazing
