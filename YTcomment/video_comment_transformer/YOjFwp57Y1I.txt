How to crochet a advanced beginner scarf
Hi there, I'm super new to crocheting and I'm having a lot of trouble getting past the second row. How do you start the 3rd row because I keep getting all messed up edges by starting in the 4th st from the hook... its slanting and not staying straight.
This is gorgeous, how many chains for the pattern or does this work with odd and even multiples?
Hi Heather , this stitch is great I love it . I'm using it to make a baby blanket and I'm using a k hook , have you changed color using this stitch ? How does it look if you have ! Thanks again . I just discovered your videos and I love them
Help I can't find pattern on here
