Love this. Do you have a video of how you make those papers that you tear and paste on ? Do you have Instagram or Facebook?
That was just too much fun Karlyn!  Thank you for letting me understand more about art.  I need to know more about composition. What do you suggest?  Linda
Hello what kind of glue I’d you use for the papers .? Not to the leaves, but the papers ..
Hi Karlyn.  Can you tell me what kind of paste do you use?  It's hard for me to understand what you are saying and do you sell it?  Thank you.
Hi, very nice video . do you use the sealer for goldleaf on whole project or only on the goldleafs?
Can you watercolour over the gold leaf?
Thank you for this demo. What is jelly paper? And can you give the name of the watered down paste that you are using?
Karlyn, so beatiful. Have you put gesso on the canvas before the procedure?
Karylyn can I ask you something please? I want to start painting should i start with oil paint or what paint is best to start?
Hi, can you do this over the painting (oil) or does it always have to be under?
What is the adhesive you use before you add your gold leaf? Love your work!
Karlyn, great video! What type of spray are you using, it produces great bursts of colour? thanks!
Karlyn I am new to abstract and have trouble with composition. You have a sheet showing different composition thumbnails. Where can one find a sheet of ideas like this.
Karlyn, are you working on watercolor canvas or regular canvas?
