Is the outside of the loaf soft? I'm searching for a recipe that doesn't cook my bread loaf where the outside is a bit hard. I bought some whole wheat berries, milled them and every time I use the whole wheat, my bread loaf is a bit hard. Maybe it's because I've been using recipes that use white all purpose flour?
Hello Ms Jenny, I love this recipe! It is my go-to for homemade bread, but to make mom life easier I recently purchased a zojirushi bread machine. Do you know if this would work in a bread machine, and if so what settings I would use for it? Thank you so much!

Do you cook anything with the cloths off?
I'm sorry - egg, milk and sugar in a whole wheat loaf? This is cake, not bread haha. This is a culture shock, bread here is made up of only flour, salt, yeast and water.
Isnt this the Sex n the City star!

Fantastic recipe... However, I don't have a nice stand mixer.. Can you show me how to make this with just my hands??  Thanks!!!
Jenny, do you have a recipe book?  I love your recipes, they are so user friendly.
Surely it would be easier just to use a breadmaker.  It does the mixing, kneading and rising for you, it will also bake it if you want it to, or you can just use it make and prove the dough, ready to manually shape and leave for the final rise and then bake it in a conventional oven.
Jen, any chance you'll come back and continue to cook with us or for us?  I love your recipes and really hope you come back! 💕💖

Can I do this recipe with Spelt flour?
Can you use a good processor
Can anybody help??? Iv baked this before perfectly but didn’t work so well this time.  Was it because I used different oil because that’s all I can think of that I used differently.  Any suggestions???
Is black flour is  complete grain flour or there is differance ?
How long do you let it sit in the pan or do you take it out right away and do you put olive oil on the top of the crust while it's warm? My bread is so dense I can barely eat it on the second day because I listened to a Julia Child's recipe which said not to leave it sticky at all and to continue to add flour while you're beating it to death to keep it dry while using the dough hook on the mixer! I am so upset. I knew better and listened anyway.
Can you tell me if I can replace the whole wheat flour with plain bread flour for a white bread loaf.? Thanks. PS: love all your videos.  The half Polish baker
To make this white bread do we just sub out the two cups of whole wheat flour with all purpose flour? For a total of 2 cups of white flour plus that little bit?

How about just putting the egg in some warm water???? Too many smashed eggs in the coat pocket visiting the farm.
I have q wheat allergy. Do you have a recipe suggestion?

Looks great. Has anyone ever done this with non dairy creamer, or rice dream or almond dream? (Also you can quickly bring eggs to room temp by putting them in a bowl of 110° water for a few minutes.  $
Jenny I love watching your cooking videos. However I have a question. Can I use gluten free all purpose flour. I am gluten intolerant and I love bread but I can't eat bread with gluten in it. And what other kind of oil that I can use other than olive oilor canola oil? As I have sensitivity to these things as well. Sincerely Kim.

may I know whats the shelf life for a bread like this...one..two or maybe three days?...thanks great video...
Who's your daddy.. now every time i make a dough i always ask it.. ROFL..
Jenny .. Love to try this!!  Have you ever used Honey instead of sugar,, and have you put sesame seeds on the top? Many years ago, my neighbor showed me how to make whole wheat bread, and it was sooo freakin' good! I remember her using those two things. I wondered when you should put the seeds on top-using butter, and if you would use less milk if you use a tablespoon or two of Honey?  The bread was just slightly sweet, but definitely made a difference!   I came back to add a question...  I just re-watched some of the video, and wondered if you've warmed cold milk in the micro, to see how long till it reaches the 130 degree temp? I don't have a gage.
Jenny, did you retire?  I haven't seen anything new and I miss your videos.  You!re a hoot and you make my day. Hope to see you soon.
Any videos Jen Can cook on cooking raw beets?
Jenny, I'm new to baking, but what is the purpose of all purpose flour or could u skip it? Sorry maybe a dumb question, but like I said new to baking.
Hello, recipe looks great! TFS! Would love to give it a go... but I have a quick question- is it possible to make this recipe without the egg (or substitute it with something else) and still have the bread be soft?  I'm trying to avoid consuming eggs... Thanks so much! Appreciate your help.

I dunno, women like watching me knead bread because it makes them think, what else can he do with his hands? Do some anger management and be firm with that dough. When I've been lazy and made no-knead bread it just isn't the same.

Hey Jenny! Girl you sure can cook! Why are you retired?! 🤔🤔🤔🤔 It would be great if you had a syndicated version of this cooking show!
Why add the sugar? A true bread would not contain sugar. And get rid of the mixing bowl, the way to make a real bread is using the ingredients and your hands to mix, thats how bread was first made

Great video, Jenny...and you made me chuckle! 😂 Can I use all whole wheat flour...without adding any white flour? Or will it come out too heavy and dense? How can I use 100% whole wheat flour but still have a bread that’s light and fluffy?
Why you want to retire?
Why do you pound on the dough? I was taught never to do that because it will damage the yeast. There is no reason to pound on the dough.

Hi Jenny. Can I use a parchment paper instead of the foil one?

I understand this is a whole wheat bread recipe but could I just ran out of whole wheat flour :/ If I replace it for all purpose flour, will it still work? Btw I LOVE all your videos! You have such a great sense of humor. It's never boring to watch your videos!

Is it okay not to add egg?? For those who are vegetarians?? Any alternate ingredient??
Mrs. Jenny,   Thank you for your recipe!!   Two questions: How do you store the bread to maintain freshness?  How long will it keep?
So it's the egg that allows you to do this without having it be necessary to rise for 18 hours (like some bread recipes I've seen)?
could we make this without sugar and oil? trying to loose weight :(
can you double this if you have a larger pan?
Can I use this recipe for white bread as well? Can I substitute the whole wheat flour with bread flour? Just want to know if that is a possibility. I never made bread before.

Hi, Can we use honey instead of sugar.. if so how many tbsp do i need to use for 2 cups of whole wheat flour?

I tried your recipe. But I found it's very hard to take the bread out of the pan after the baking is done. I've already greased the pan with olive oil before putting the dough in. Do you have any suggestions? Thank you.
Could I replace the whole wheat flour with all purpose or bread flour for a loaf of white bread instead of whole wheat?

Can I substitute the milk for water?
Hello Jenny, Great video and quick. Roughly how much flour did you use in that loaf? That tin you used is that a large loaf or medium. I'm in UK where 800g bread is classed as large. Thanks
can you provide nutritional info for your recipes thanks
I love it...can you post the recipe of whole wheat bread...thank you!
I bought the regular yeast, so how many cups of water should I use? Do I have to use less flour and milk?
How often do you do videos? Once a week I  look to see if there is a new one... But there usually isn't.
Can we do this with out using egg? Pl let me know
÷good video, loved it, if I don't use the eggs, sugar and the olive oil which I avoid, am I going to have the same result?
Hello Jenny! First of all thanks for all the wonderful videos that you make. Highly informative and very well produced..... I have a question for you; I recently bought a 5x10 loaf pan 3 inches high and I cannot find an exact recipe or information of the ingredients measurements that I would need to make whole wheat bread on this particular loaf pan. Could you help me figure it out.  Thanks Jenny  Best Regards
Where did you find that adorable kitchen timer that looks like the big mixer? I love it!
Who came from vine?
hello mam can you pls tell me the ingredients in grams and milk in litre that you usedl  thnks
Jenny...where did you get those colorful spatulas? Especially the purple one.
I'm not sure if that extra cup of all purpose flour was used in the recipe, or just the small portion you sprinkled in and the remaining used to flour the board...?
where do you get all your colorful baking items? Gorgeous. Making the Bread right now and it smells wonderful:) thank you.....  By the way lol I kept thinking gosh do I know this lady in real life? I have seen her and know her voice,  It took me days to figure it all out.
Jenny  I really like your recipes and have made many of them. I must ask you, however, what's the hurry on your bread? Your recipe is very similar to my own whole wheat, but I believe that by taking the time to allow it two full rises, the flavor is even better.
I am impressed,  how about if I make it white bread, can i use the all purpose flour or other kind of flour? will it be the same texture?
Thanks Jenny, I am a 65 year old man just learning to cook, thanks to your videos. One quick question, can the bread be sliced to make sandwiches?   ps: I made your meat loaf, it was so damn good ......!!!
Hello Jenny! How come all your recipe are the best, you must have something special and magic in your hands! We love you, 💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
