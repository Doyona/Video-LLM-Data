Can I use a pastry Blender instead of a food processor?
Thanks great little recipe, just waiting for my first one to come out the oven 😁🙌💕 umm did I miss it or did you mention popping back in the oven for how long? and same 350⁰?
Hi there Could you use parchment paper as well to just pull them out of the pan?
I am a Canadian and love butter tarts. I have made them with our preference, pecans. They are a lot of work so I am now going to make these, hoping they will be as good. Unfortunately, I can't add pecans as i have grandsons with allergies but I think they will be very good plain.I have followed many of your recipes and I have an important question. It looks like you are using a convection oven. I have that choice with my regular oven but dont use it for baking. I wonder if you can address the possible difference in times to bake, etc with or without using it. Thank you.
Wondering why you give metric measurements along with regular measurements??  But Yum!!
with nut allergies in my family what can I use in place of walnuts
Hi Stephanie, if I do not want the filling to be too sweet, will it be OK if I reduce the sugar?
My filling baked out very liquidy with a layer of caramel forming at the top. I didn't mess up any of the ingredients so why would it come out so weird?
Is it okay to use peanuts? I hate pecans, walnuts and raisins! But I really like peanuts and I hope it's okay to use them! Thank you 😂👍🏻😅
I am Vegetarian...is there anything I can use as an egg substitute, but still retain the flavor and texture?
Do you think I could replace the corn syrup with maple syrup? Thanks for the recipe!
Hey Stephanie! Could you make a video demonstrating how to do churros?
Hello from Russia! Tried the recipe today replacing corn syrup with honey, unfortunately top of the tart browned too quickly but the middle was still runny :( so the result was yummy but not presentable :( maybe Next time I should add some cornstarch to thicken honey? Thank you!
I love your videos Stephanie! I have made half of them! I have a question I don't have a food processor? ~Miranda thanks!
5th? Lol   That look soooo delicious, i'm gonna try that one of these days :)
