How well has the paint held up? Thanks
Do you need to use a primer?
PAINT???????  lots of info on tape - so sick of yt videos that are total waste of time!
This video was literally about how to cut tape in half, not about how to paint a floor. What the did I just watch?
can you tell me how this held up please?
I am painting my linoleum bathroom.  How would I seal it?
What type of primer!! Omg!
Great, 4 minutes on tape - what kind of paint did you use?
That looks more like vinyl flooring. I am wary of how well this will stand up over time without a primer put on it first. Can you provide an update on how this floor has held up? Also, you can buy 1/4" tape on Amazon. Save yourself lots of time! http://www.amazon.com/TAPE-SPECIALTIES-15006-60-Yard-Painters/dp/B0006ITPMK/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1427394898&sr=8-7&keywords=1%2F4%22+tape
