This came up when I did a search for a keto olive oil cake.. going to make this instead tonight. Have you ever done a video of an olive oil  cake? Not seeing one come up..
Why dont the Indians eat eggs? A religion thing?
Can I used extra virgin olive oil instead of olive oil? TIA.
Hey can you tell me where you buy your dark chocolate from? Can I also add butter instead of olive oil? And thanks for the sugar sub..orderin it right away 😃
I don't know why oil seperates out when I start folding in the egg white. Could you please help with this?
Also, did I miss how many grams of chocolate & how much sugar you used?
What's with horns up? Lol hahaha
That looks Yummy, how about making us rhubarb & set custard with a peanut tuile, I know your imagination can tame that fool🤦‍♀️
Is the chocolate with sugar?
Hi Sahil, just clarifying because the video and the written recipe are different... Is it 50 grams chocolate or 75 grams chocolate? And I gather from the written recipe that it is 50 g of olive oil I think?  Thanks! Can't wait to try it once I pasteurize some eggs (I'm too much of a chicken to eat raw eggs from my county, lol)😂
Your eggs look ultra healthy. Where did you get them from?
One of my favorites was cereal. Can you try creating a keto/low carb version of plain Cap'n Crunch cereal?
Which song is it at the end before you start eating the mousse?
What electric mixer do you use bro ? Anybody with good recommendations under 1200 bucks
I'm curious... doesn't it have an after taste of the olive oil?
Hey can you make keto pudding? ive just been using sugar free pudding mix and carb free almond milk to substitute the milk. The only downside is its really hard to gauge what a serving size is once you make it. Any help?
Can you try to make Nigella’s clementine cake? That’s definitely Keto, need to sub for the sugar of course, but it’s delicious!

Please can you make cheesecake?? That’s one thing I miss when I am on Keto 😔
Can you try a Tocino de Cielo? It’s similar to a flan, but better :)
Can you please do a video about fall pumpkin based recipes?
Looks yummy, I wonder if I could use avocado oil? Anyway fav pud has to be sticky toffee pudding with toffee sauce, can't remember the last time I had that 😛
Could you use ghee or butter? If so, what do you like better?
Creme Brûlée? BTW, I’m wondering how this mousse recipe would taste with something more neutral like avocado oil. Oh I almost forgot - RAS MALAI!!!
Hahahaha you are so funny 😂 how can you separate two eggs?! They are already separated! 🤓
How did you know I was typing? haha
Why would anyone be an eggless keto vegan why would anyone do that to themselves lol

Do you use a light olive oil for this recipe? I'm with Allyson....creme brulee and pasteis de nata (a Portuguese pastry) are my faves!!
I forget where Deepti (spelling) is.. Instagram?  Have either of you used ISOMALT in baking?  "Stop typing."  Loved that part. =D Kudos!
