Hi! I don’t think anyone will answer but please please help me!! My waterbottle isn’t working no matter what! Whenever I suck on it, no water comes out, I’ve tried everything!! Any tips?:(   if you know how to fix it pleaseeee tell me, my moms gonna kill me :/
What kind of screw is in the lid?  I don't have any bits that match with the hole in the middle
Why can't I drink from the straw?!
Any ideas on if/where I can buy replacement valve covers?
Where can I buy a replacement air valve??? mine is cracked...
I can't figure out how to take the top part off of the bottom in order to get the air vent back in. Can you help me? Thanks!!
