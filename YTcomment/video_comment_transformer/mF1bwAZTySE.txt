Dude how do you have blood left! Always bleeding!
How is this man still alive?!!?

USC once when does rob say carefully ?!😂😂
Seeing blood really stresses me out... Is that normal
I don't know - this video is about BAKED marbles.  If you tried actually FRYING them, as the name of the technique implies, the result ***might*** be different.  However, I definitely would wear safety goggles and put some kind of a cover over the frying pan - a splash guard made of screen-like material that allows air through but is made to prevent pops of grease or food from flying all over is probably the perfect thing to use.
pigeon can't believe  rob burnt himself???
was that a weed necklace???
🤢too much blood, y is rob still alive?? 😂
Seriously are you okay?
