What do I do if both fuel lines are the same size and they fit both nipples tight?
How can you tell which fuel line connector is which once you have removed?
Frustrated! My craftsman model 358 hedge trimmer does NOT have a primer ball. So all I want to know is how you get the fuel started flowing from tank yo engine. Does anyone know?
Can't comprehend why the Pro Series Extra Quiet XQ trimmer line is not available in 3 or 5 lb spools - if only online/through SPD. Have been using the 0.130 line on my Shindaiwa B450 (41.5 cc trimmer/brushcutter) for well over 12 years - too much power for thinner lines tho. Went to the store in Brandon, FL and was able to buy one of the last clam spools left around.
why
My fuel tank opening is on the opposite end of the tank to the fuel line entry holes, any idea's how i can pull my new line's through the hole's ?, the tank is curved and you cannot even see the holes from the fuel tank opening.
why don't you show the connector part?
