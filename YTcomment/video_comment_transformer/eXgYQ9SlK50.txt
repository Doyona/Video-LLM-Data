When they're in a triangle what did you do? Where did you put it
Hi there I looking for a knitting pattern for leggings do you know of a pattern thank you.
20 on each dpn? Or 20 dived on to 3 dpns?
Ugh Why does everyone use dpns for these patterns?!
I need a easy leg warmer pattern using straight needles with just knit and purls ty
They look great but I have never knitted anything before and I am trying to follow along how did you get them to loop together into a circle? I got lost after the first minute and a half :-( great job tho!! They look so cute
How long does this normally take you to make a pair
how many stitches have to cast on if using circular needles or one pointed needle?!
How much yarn did you need to knit both legwarmers?
How many stitches have to cast on if using circular or one pointed needles?? 60??
Between 1:46 and 1:47, what was the step to do ??
