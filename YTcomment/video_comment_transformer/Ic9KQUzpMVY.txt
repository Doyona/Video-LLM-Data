What natural cleaners do you use around your home?
I have my bake to bake for mum's birthday. Do I have to use wire wool. I don't want to scratch the surface.
Do you have trick for cleaning the glass door, between the glass and the gauge?
Thank you! Maybe a weird question, but does the steel wool not cause scratches? I’ve always been told not to use scratchy stuff to do oven glass cause it would crack.
Is distilled vinegar same as white vinegar ?🤔
How about under the top inside where is accumulated most the grass? Can I spray it as well ? Thanks!
What if it is a steam clean oven
What do you suggest for cleaning the cloth-like trim inside the oven door?
what are you using on the glass window?  Steel wool?
Which ingredients were used
Did you know that you could take OFF the door for the oven😳 to make it easy for you to get in there & clean 😊👍🏾
Do you have any tips for cleaning an oven door and glass cover that opens out instead of down?
How much vinegar?
Great solution!  I wonder if before you do that you were to warm the oven first, like put it at 250 degrees, then shut it off, and when cooled some, do your procedure. You might need to scrub less.
Scrub pad scratches doesn't it
Does the scrubber scratch the glass? If not what type of scrubber is it?
Well detailed. Does the aluminum ball thing scratch the glass door?
Do you think lining the bottom of the oven with heavy duty aluminum foil will help keep it from getting so cruddy over time?
