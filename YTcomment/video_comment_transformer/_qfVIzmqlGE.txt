Isn't it raw meat?
Can you also produce ham from halal meat like a cow?, i mean same method but made from cow meat
At no point in the video was the trademark Parma ducal crown visible I question the authenticity of the cam he was slicing without the Parma ducal crown Visible.  That ham was a fake for sure
Idk why but that guy has a seriously punchable face.
After cutting, do you cover the exposed area with the tan mixture of lard, salt and pepper to preserve until the next customer asks for a cut?  Appropriately how many thin cuts do you get before hitting the shank?

Is the narrator Welsh/Italian ?

How the hell did I get here?

Please let me known how can i buy ham from your? Im at VietNam now. Send for me at emai : quynhtran.tv@gmail.com. Thanks.
Couldn't they find a better name than Ham Clam? Also, where do I buy one?
How much does this whole thing cost?
If fat protects the ham, why does the back 70% without the fat not matter? This is such an overpriced over rated ham. yes I have had it, it's salt that's it.
I am having an exam in 4 hours, why am I watching this?
Why did I just watch a guy cutting ham for 5 mins
Why am I watching a guy cutting a ham instead of studying?
how much money is a new ham?!
so you cut away the rind, right?
whats the point of such thin slices...
What company is this product from? Im not sure he mentions it in the video.
Unsaturated fat? Is that another BS fact in your long list of total BS? Or is it what modern Italian schools teach?
im just trying to figure out if the voice actor used an italian accent because hes translating an italian , or because he is italian.
is the meat still raw or ready to be eaten?
pork is forbidden meat right? no?
How did I get here?  Why did I watch this?
