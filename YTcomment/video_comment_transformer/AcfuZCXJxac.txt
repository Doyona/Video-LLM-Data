Curious why you add yeast to the dough since you don't raise it anyway???
I have a set of 3 of those pastry cutter/sealers. They are fun to use. I love your recipes. Your videos help me to have new ideas and to refresh my memory on old recipes I haven't made in a while.  I do have one question about this recipe; why didn't you do an egg wash before deep frying? I adds a crispy texture to the outside, while maintaining a sort of, soft center. Thanks, Chef for yet another wonderful recipe.
Is it something wrong with your video recorder? The pixel is chunky. It started since the shrimp stock video. Other video before that seem fine
Is there a way to do this without a food processor?
