3:28  Looks good but will it hold 200+ pounds?  Did everything work out ok?  Is it holding?
Is that drywall?? Or brick wall?
Is it just me, or did he hang this upside down?
Is this still hanging on the wall?
Everything about this video hurt my brain. I don't even understand the point of this video if you didn't show the end result of the job. Was this an advertisement for the wrong way of mounting a rack on a wall, and then you ended the video? How on earth do you have 17k subs? Are 16.9K of them russian bots?  You should be happy YT removed the dislike button, because i'm betting the like:dislike ratio is 1:100 minimum.
So you rather have it fall on top of them? Great Hitman execution
How did you decide on what bolts to install?
Do you have a isp?
Has it fallen off the wall yet? You can't hang a rack on anchors. It needs to be mounted to studs.
what is the rack size. is this 6u?
How long did it take you to discover you hung it upside down? Keyholes have the large hole towards down, and the small section towards top, so you push the enclosure over a bolt, then gravity pulls it down into the smaller part of the keyhole, snugging it up. You hung yours with the large part at the top......which is why you needed washers.
did that cabinet help cut down on the fan noise of the devices?
what are the deminsions of that rack
did you have to put any screws using the studs?
do you know the name of this particular cabinet?
what size switch fits in there?
