I’m looking for a heater that is safe to be left running in a 20’ rv during the winter while I am at work, would this be safe or is there a better option?
What is the background music called?
Any thoughts on how this may work in a smaller bedroom(150sq ft)?
Will this help lower my electric bill in a trailer 14x80
I know this is an old video but can anyone hot this gets to touch in the back or anywhere on the 1500 watt setting?
would you like to do a review on the Phoenix 1500? https://www.amazon.com/Heat-Storm-HS-1500-PHX-WIFI-Infrared-Heater/dp/B07JXRWJ8D/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=heat+storm+heater&qid=1575932721&s=home-garden&sr=1-6
Thanks for reviewing.  But what's with the heater on a dock?  :-P
Does it make noise when it's on? Is there a fan in it?
Does it dry out the air as much like other heaters do?
Is this a heater review or RV sales film?
