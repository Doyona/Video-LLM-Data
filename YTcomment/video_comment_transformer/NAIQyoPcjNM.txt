If a king has no legal moves, if he can't move at all, isn't that a stalemate instead of a checkmate?
How do the king move when i play chess?
Anyone from 2024? Watching
Who else came here bc there's a chess competition at school?
Um.. The Knight costs the same as the bishop (3 points) the bishops do not cost 3.5 points.
I thought the points went 1 3 3 5 8? Was i wrong? How is it determened?
4:40 it should be A2 to H2 for pawns??
Whose here in 2024?
I need to check 😅
I'm totally confused by what I see at 4:26. Three pawns on the first row, protecting the king. How did they get there if they can't move backwards? Otherwise, thanks for a pretty effective video.
What about Il Vaticano?
Who's here and learning it for their partner?
Who else is still confused?
This is about killing an opponent--is that legal?
Can the rook move both horizontally _and_ vertically in one move, like an 'L'? And can a knight move diagonally to the left/right and then right' left (or vice versa) in one move to make a 'V'? Also, can the queen move both diagonally, vertically and diagonally in one move? And can any piece move both backwards and forwards? ♟♖

Why does this guy sound like a mixture of Nicolas Cage and Jeff Goldblum?

Anyone else here because of Lelouch from Code Geass? Or Anime in general? 💠🌐
So the rock can jump over a queen and a king, only if it is its first move?
The initial discussion of rook captures might not be clear.  That turned me off the video.  It doesn’t show an example. Pawns from a1 to h1????   You must say check?   Real chess players don’t say check.  A bishop should be 3.25 according to Bobby Fischer.  I agree. A rook and two pawns are usually better than two bishops.  Also, can’t castle across check.
Anybody an experienced player yet visiting here?thumbs up
Why am I watching this?  I already know how to play chess 😐
So the ponds upgrade when they reach the other side?
One question:can the queen move in a horizontal and vertical in the same turn?

I really wanna learn but I don’t get it any tips from the pros?
Ur video is not clear
But what if ur opponent watched this

Who's else here learn from watching Kanan on power?

Wait how do you play chess again?
Why is the pawn on the Rook Introduction isnt promoted

Is there a follow up to this video??
This leaves me with 1 more question .... who invented chess 😎

Chess is nice but you ever try Pokémon?
Let me get this straight, you say rooks and knights, instead of castles and horses? Am I being thick?
It introduced the castling move to the right, but isn't there also a castling move to the left? And if so, can anyone give me a run down?.....Well I'm not asking you to run me down but if there is such a move to the left as to the right, what is the procedure?
The bishop is only 3 points. Right?
Am I the only one who still dont get it.

Can u pls tell me that if we r starting with pawns how many moves should go forward and Simply playing with pawns that is all the pawn can move forward with 2 moves from its original place
I'm still new to chess. I can't seem to checkmate for the life of me, why is it so hard! It's so frustrating to lose against a level 1 CPU on Chess online or at the very best tie with it! I try my best but I don't seem to get any better. Any help with strategies on how to start a game of chess?
You are checking the comments to see if chess is easy.

can your king move through check when castling?
Why can't the black pieces go first? Smh
Who else is a chess master here??
How many times should I watch this before I set out to play chess. I've watched it twice now. Plan on watching 3 more times. Yes, I am slow    Lol
At 4:40 pawns placed in A1 to H1 or A2 to H2 ?
Need some clarification, only the first move of any pawn can move forward two squares, right?
Did you forget about castling and the king can get in check
9:46 why did the rook can change with the queen?
Good in theory, have you played the master level?
Lol why am I watching this video
how bout the king moving through check, or ya know  moving check? ok I'll just castle into check and break the rule never put your king in check
WHY would you ever have triple pawns, and you can't even have pawns there, the one on he edge can't get there
Do u need to be adept at math? I almost don’t even want to try 😕
What about draw rules ? Also u can't castle if the opponent's piece  is occupying  F.1,G.1,B.1,C.1,D.1 and the eight rank for black.

Can a tower be a queen by upsidedowning it bright side?
Why can't black pieces go first? Is this racism??
9:37 why not play Nxe4. Getting you a pawn, and after any non threatening move play d5 giving you a strong center?
When did bishops become 3.5 points?? It depends entirely on the nature of the position whether bishops or knights are better. They’re both 3.  Also, pawn phalanxes are better than chains. You control more space and the pawns are ready to advance when the time is right. Chains also make outposts that enemy pieces will usually occupy.  Also, it’s not always best to promote to a queen. Sometimes under promotion (promoting to something that’s not a Queen) helps gain tempi in things like the lasker trap. (Note for new players: don’t play traps they usually get you in worse positions if your opponent plays even halfway decently. I just happened to know this one involved an under promotion in some variations so I mentioned it)
Bishop 3.5????? Lol
French move must be done immidiately, so it can not be done unless the next move right?
Points matter? It’s going to end with a checkmate so I think it’s not important
Wait is chess a sport I have played like for 7 years but I thought it was just a game I know there’s clubs and championships but I  just watching this because I think I want to buy another deck with numbers
