How long has it lasted?
What about just clean and just simply paint so they don’t oxidize in the future? Would love to get your feedback on that.
I was wondering, did the color fade pretty fast since you have done this?
Your shutters look great before you started. I have the same burgundy shutters, they've turn white from bleaching from the sun! How would you rejuvenate something like mine?
Great video - I plan to use the rejuvenate but can you tell me which side of the scotch brite you scrubbed with? Yellow or green? Also when you scrubbed did you use soap and water or was it a dry scrub? Thanks.
Hi, Any update on how long it lasted?  Thank you
Would you recommend using a satin or semi-gloss clear coat after cleaning to last longer? Just curious...
how long do they last before they look faded again?
Awesome video.  So now the problem becomes, what can be used to circumvent the scrubbing in preparation for the Rejuvenate.  I'm being told to wipe down with Oxi-clean which basically melts off the oxidation without much scrubbing if any. Then after you rinse, it will be ready for the rejuvenate without having to have used much elbow grease.
