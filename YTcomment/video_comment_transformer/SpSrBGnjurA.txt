I have a question. I made some 'asian donuts' recently and found that after they cooled they had a strange flavor to them, my assumption would be that it was because of the oil I cooked in. The oil I used was Canola. I haven't had a chance to test this theory yet by using a different oil to cook them in, but have you found any similar type of issues when using Canola?

I tried making crepes for the firs time a few days ago. It came out okay, but while the crepes were "cooking" they swell. Why is that? Did I put too much batter? I used a 1/4 cup for each crepe. And I let it chill for over an hour (because almost every recipe said to do that.)And mine weren't paper thin, but they were thin. I love crepes, so I plan to make it again (and let it chill overnight). But I'm really curious as to why it swell.
