Does this work with any kind of rice? Or does it have to be a certain kind?
water and oil  don't mix lady
😁 M🏀 /\
how long will it take  to grow
Ok I have a recipe that work really well   Rice water (Any rice will work) soak it in water for 20 minutes to an hour   After that mix honey and coconut oil into the rice mixture(you can use any oil u have 😊)   Put it in a spray bottle or apply it regularly   Leave it over night and wash it in the morning  (For extra growth add peppermint or rosemary oil)  Use it for about a week!  I’ve used it for only 2 days and my hair grew over an inch!   T
Hlo nice video dear friend

Who is watched this in 2021

How long does it take to grow your hair?
Can anyone explain to me please
Rice water videos are cap because the Weiss water ratio has to be 121 if it is even slightly off the mixture will not work also it's not just rice water it's a mixture between different nuts and minerals and different berries and such that are very expensive.
How many days do we have to apply this
Mam it's a real or fake please tell me
For those who cut their bangs and really regret it and try to grow your bangs really fast. I feel you bro😭😭😭 I will never cut my hair again
Instead of essential oil, can we use castor oil
1. Do you have to use organic rice? 2. Do you have to boil the water? 3. Can you leave the mixture in your hair for a few days? 4. Can you make a big batch of the water and store it in the refrigerator?
Does it matter what kind of rice is used and are trims ever done to the ends of the hair?
no one:   me: checks in the comment in case if it doesn’t work😙
My hair is so thin and short plz give me some idea to get long and thicker
The hair is made of keratin. Vitamins A, B-H Biotin, Zinc have keratin in it and ingesting these vitamins double speeds the restoration, strength, growth, shine of your hair and nails; makes your skin healthier. Vitamin below has Vitamins A, B-H Biotin, Zinc all in one pill. All the Kardashians take the vitamin and also promote it. Take 2 pills per day. Get your bottle at link in profile under ABOUT.
Thank you.
will it still work if we don't have essential oil?

Are you saved friend? If you died tonight will you go to heaven or hell? God Almighty, the Creator was manifest in the flesh. He came into the world to take away the sin of the world. He gave up his own life to save yours. His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for your redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him.   This is the Gospel which means the Good News.  John 1:1,14 KJV In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [14] And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,

Hi guys, I know nobodybwill see this but this works I used it about 1 year ago. I used it every 3 to 5 days and it grew about 1 inch and my hair is alot longer.
Fake! I applied rice water. Ita damages my hairs.
Yes, it's simple to make, but I have to wait 2 weeks before I can use it😂
You need to trim your hair by 5 inches. The orange color on the hair just looks tacky. Black hair will look much more beautiful and healthy
I tried it she lies!
Are u liying
For lazy ppl  Do ur hair down and massage for 4-5 mins do day and night for week  And u can see change!! 💜😁
What kind of rice- brown, processed, Jasmine, etc.?
I'm surprised at myself  I see som1 with short hair so I cut it cuz it's cute  Then a day later I see som1 with long hair i regret my decision and look for these remedies BUT STILL NEVER USE THEM
It works really I have tried first you have to make the rice water then you have to put the rice water in a spray bottle then you have to put in at night just before sleeping and then massage for 5 min and then sleep after waking up take a bath use this remedy it's amazing
Don't speak English and this is not real I hate this video
Ok this is the second video I saw with this recipe, I believe it! Ill edit this comment once it’s done!
To all the protien sensitive girls out there.. beware.. high chances of loosing your hair.. I did mine.. if you still wana try.. dont over do it, try once wait for a 1 and half weeks to see how your hair reacts.. and even your hair takes it well.. dont over do.. i went crazy with it.. twice a week and lost more than 50% of my hair..  being a thin hair girl.. you know how much it sucks.

Long hair
Long hair
You seem like such a sweet and genuine person.
they only trim their hair once in their entire life. it is normal to have hair that long. but I don't want to lose faith and I'm going to try
Nice video but my hair is over a yard long and I've never used rice water. It's thick and healthy, and my students say 'so soft'! Last year I walked into a room to sub and all the students collectively gasped when they saw how long my hair is.  I usually wear it up but that day, I chose to wear it down. Anyhow, the one thing I DO do is bend at the waist a couple times a week, hang from the waist, touch my toes, breathe deeply and let my hair fall to the floor/carpet. Feels so good and I can feel tension going away. I do this for maybe 3 minutes. My hair grows 3/4 to an inch a month and I am convinced this (blood) is what nourishes my hair so that it CAN grow quickly. When I sleep, I usually put it up in a topknot which is also good for the hair b/c it pulls the hair in a different direction and stimulates growth. I've cut it so many times but this time I plan on letting it get knee-length...just because!  Good luck on your hair journey :-) Whatever works for YOU!
Hi mam ky long hair cutna k bade fir sa long ho sakta haa
Rice water is good for hair.....it's kind of manipuri 👧 shampoo....but bazar wala chawal se faida nhi hoga gau ka jo bina polishing wala chawal.. Hota he ushe faida hota he.. N no need to waste rice..... As khana bana ne k time jab chawal dhote he tab uska pani Ko jama kar rakh lete he...jab ushe alag sa smell ata he tab vo pani for hair wash ready hojata he Ye traditional  he purwajo k time se.... N thoda smell jada hota he....boil krne ki bhi jarurat nhi But ajkal hum ishe follow nhi karte
Do I have to do this everyday...?

don’t use rice water too often because you don’t want too much protein
my hair is at my shoulder blades and i'm quite unhappy with the length. i used to have really long hair and then i cut it to my shoulders in fourth grade. it was summer and it was so much lighter. i spend a year growing it, and it was a pretty decent length, but then i cut it to just below my ears. i loved it, then after 2 weeks i started to hate it. thankfully, it grew to my shoulders by sixth grade. i had been growing out my hair, and then i told my mom i wanted a small trim. without telling me, she told the stylist to cut my hair to just below my shoulders. that was a good decision though because i hadn't been taking care of my hair. now i take really good care of my hair and i want it to grow really bad.

Hey dear, this hair treatment I don't believe it because you Indians naturally have long hair but for us blacks it's different
Is it safe for your hair??
One question how long did it take for you to grow your hair that long??
4:56 that was the best bun ever
We have wash our hairs with shampoo or just with water
Does the water have to be warm or does it matter?
Can i use after having hair oil  Please replay
Does it matter what kind of rice you use?
This actually worked I’m shocked
How long have you been using fermented  rice water?
Beautiful uoung lady but hair too long and has split ends..needs a trim
Can we use the same rice again?
perfectooooooo yass
It work, I did it for the past 3-4 months. The thickness of the hair is amazing and it still falls down,but not that much. And it grew around 2-3 inches
Ewww that’s DISGUSTING! I know if I want to do this...

That hair needs a trim.
Could you please tell me how many times it must be applied to our hair for better results
mmh nc hair
That's what I do sometimes.
My hometown is in Guang Xi.
I think you should mention about putting it in the refrigerator after 24 hours and how long you can keep it also how many times you should put with side effects.
beautiful. But I would trim the ends to make it look healthier!:)
Bitch it’s not one ingredient
Do you do this daily or once a week?
Omg that girl on the cover is exactly like my friend! They r twins
Does it need warm or cold watter
My hair has been down to my knees in the past. Now it's long enough to sit on. It's thick and healthy. I never used rice water in my life!

Is it true 🤔
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcc_sKQegRNWd19_QExIICQ
Hair become very dry
https://youtu.be/vRNkTm5nNo8
This works but when you do it you need to wash your hair before or after
For all y'all scrolling through the comments to see if this actually works, I tried it for you it does! At first there were no visible signs of growth but my hair was super shiny and baby soft. After about a week I saw visible signs of growth! I ended getting five inches in one month. After that month, growth slowed down a little bit. I continued to use it and I noticed there was a lot less breakage and my hair was always really soft so people always wanted to feel it. I went to the hairdresser to get a haircut (God knows why) and she told me my hair was the healthiest she had ever seen. It really does work!
No true
Any specific type of rice?
I miss my hair being that long
Do you wash it out?
I just made let's hope it works! 🙏🏼🤞🏼

does the rice water make your hair grow longer or just makes it stronger
We're all thinking this...   4:50    *I want a tutorial on how to do that bun*

Many things work to grow your hair. One of em is "GENES"
Ur hair is very long but it seems very thin...   (No hate)
I have to put rice water in my hair when I am wishing it  I dose do it when I wishing it
Please be at my funeral because my mom was me getting the 🍚 rice and now I'm ded
My hair is down to my butt, but where I live that's short hair because people are used to hair touching the ground or longer (for girls). so if you see anybody with short hair till their shoulders they will think you are a boy.
Does this work for hair regrowth on  someone who's completely bald
My hair will not grow for so long
Your hair is so dry 😖

Who would want that long hair
On daily wash,,, i don't think so the hair will be healthy and long... Because for hair wash we use the shampoo which has too much chemicals, Can you give me any suggestion related to my question...?
Think I will skip
Do you add boiled water or normal water
I love it
Is this like an overnight thingy and boom it will work after it is applied to your hair?
Who else tried this does it work
Who else got confused weirded out when she said you can blend the rice and use it as a face mask if you want us to get the blooming pimples
For how long can we store this

I hope it's works
Wondering why the rice water is boiled, wouldn't it take away the nutritional content in it - may someone explain, thank you.
If I was to comb my hair the amount of times she did, I'd be bold 🙄
You dont need to boil it... your actually boiling away all the vitamins and nutrients that help grow healthy hair...!
do you do this remedy everyday?!
Im south african🇿🇦, when i cut my chemically strengthened hair to go natural in feb 2019, i used rice water as a base component, trust me there was a significant growth, i saw a huge difference in just 2 to 4 months of use, i stopped around april, due to time constraint but i started using rice water again this month feb 2020... Its done wonders for my afro.. Will see what happens in the year 2020... Currently my hair is the same length it was when it was chemically strengthened... I washed my haired weekly and used olive n coconut oil... Stored the water in the fridge... Hope this help... Much love
Is nobody going to mention she has like 30cm dead ends ?
Can you use any kind of rice?
Rice also makes u skinny lol
Ha! It's genetics...
Hi  after apleying  rice water  wash with plain water or apply shampoo  tell
Warm or cold water? This is a cool video, but you need to be a bit more specific so People can understand. I’m not trying to be rude or mean, and I’m not hating, just giving advise 😊 now could someone please tell me, cold or hot water?
Wow, my hair is short but doesnt even take a comb throught it easily as yours. Huh
🌹
My hair reaches the back of my knees and they don’t look as fried as hers. All i do is put a bunch of different oils in my scalp like a few times every few months (because im SOO lazy and don’t do it more regularly) and try to keep from damaging my ends. And trim like once a year. So altough this is good advice i guess, it aint no “magic” to growing long hair. Literally just DONT cut ur hair and itll be long. If itll look healthy or not just depends on how you treat it.
You need to cut those ends
Sis if you don’t trim your ends
Yes it's true
Is it okay if i did not wash my hair after massaging it? Bcs im to lazy to do it
Is it okay if only rice water bcs i dont have essential oil
How many days until its working?
I will try it and tell u my results
Man,does this even work? I only have a median hair short 😅What? I feel that I wouldn't do that kind of stuff......well...I wanna try..but...I don't want to ruin my hair! Gosh no! 😂
But trim the dead ends... #Lovely job 🤗🤗🤗
Does rice water make ur hair thicker ? And prevent hair loss ? Please answer my hair is very long but very fine and thin

Did it work out ?? If yes please like
The problem I see is,,, your hair length is dead anyway. It is only the root that is alive. Scientist  told  me. So it's all in the scalp and inner that needs working on. So when she says loads of water then it means you are keeping off shite like coke and coffee and other fizzy crap and that is good for the body. Look at a dogs hair. It is hair. It isn't what we put on it as it comes from his/her food and water. Healthy eating and drinking.
Don't bleach or dye your hair.  It ruins it when you try to grow long.
You can use any water to wash hair.  Nothing else is needed.
Thanks for sharing, i want to try this and upload it to my channel..

Our hair has to be nourished from both inside and out side. Blood carries the vitamins, fatty acids to hair cell from inside, However, we can support our hair from the root to tip with some natural oil and hair care product. I have seen some comments about %100 Pure Argan oil and Argan rain shampoo . My sister is using them. Her hair grows faster than before, which looks shiny and healty. check it out.

Thank you so much. Its so simple.  :))
Thank you so much for this I will try it.I have long black (lots of grey by temples n roots) but not as long as your magnificent hair.as i am 5'7 my hair falls just touching the lower part of my butt cheeks so its not nearly as long as yours, butt, lol, apparently I can remedy that with your tips.I would love to find one for greying hair.I am inuvaluit (eskimo to igoramuses) and really like my hair but it falls out a lot, I am 60 after all. I could have a soccer size hairball in a week, i swear ,just from the floor and brush.Its depressing.Its not thin but I see it going there.i will let you know results on January 20 (my 2nd sons b-day, turn'n 40) by commenting.

It is all about geneticaly hair growth tendency gifted by DNA not rice water,  not every one can get long hair like this girl, if a person has thin short hair by birth so such remedys would  work only 3% or 5% and thats it,

As a person who's hair grows quickly and has straight hair, I really recommend for you to not brush your hair a lot. Brush it, but don’t strain it. Cut your ends at least.

Yoh long hair is hard to take care of but its always beautiful.
Ok
Your long hair is lovely.  People pay alot for extensions-just to look like your hair.  But if your hair ever gets matted or tangled PLEASE....PLEASE....PLEASE... do not cut your hair.  that does not solve anything.  aS FAST as you can go to www.hairdetanglerschool.com and book a detangle service appointment.   And buy the take down remover cream.
I’ve an effective plan for longer hair which I’m following now . Not to go the barber for 3 years at least. Let your hair grow naturally and just put hair oil often .
Its always been a dream of mine to be a living rapunzel!
I haven’t cut my hair in 10 years! And I’m only 11! My hair is really long smooth and thick! If you need something then can grow your hair it is the rice water, and put henna in your hair , and coconut oil! My hair is extremely long from these techniques, you can Oslo try eating more vitamins, vitamins make your hair thicker and make your hair grown faster!coconut oil can smoothen out your hair and make it grow really fast! And henna is the best one out of them all it smoothens out your hair , it makes it go extremely long super fast and it makes your hair thick and it gives your body sooo much vitamins and that can help your nails grow long , fast! Now my hair is Olmost longer than me! I am 140 centimeters and my hair is 136 centimeters! ❤️
someone tell me why i ate the rice
The ladie in those videos dont only use rice water. they add a few things so all of these rice videos are a lie because they are already taking hairgrowth vitamins smh
Damn so that rice that just sits in the cabinet has a use?
Dont stress, drink alot of water and exercise to grow your hair:   this is too much for me to do.. lol
Eat rice and wash with rice 😂
Do u always do this to your hair
Does it work if you dont put a lavender oil?
Who else is scrolling comments to see if it really works or not😁hit like
I have a really good question do you wash ur hair after or before doing this method

I'm about to make SWEET sticky rice can i use the Gluttonous rice water for this?
Can we Put hair oil in the rice water
I would like to know how you found out that your hair had grown 6 inches (15 cm!) in only 2 months. Was it measured properly with a tape measure, ruler or something like that (preferably by another person, difficult, if not impossible, to measure properly yourself), both before and after? Or is 6 inches an estimation based on how much it looks like it has been growing?   Adding products etc to your hair (dead substance/fibers), can NOT affect the hair growth (which happens within the body). It can only condition and strengthen the hair that already has grown out, so that length loss due to breakage etc is stopped.
No, their secret is NOTHING they put in their hair❗️Their «secret» is GENETIC❗️❗️❗️ They are GENETICALLY GIFTED with GREAT, THICK, SHINY & STRONG HAIR FROM THEIR ANCESTORS❗️ Nothing you wash your hair with or spray on it, can give you such hair, unless you were born with it to begin with❗️❗️❗️

Hi!! I will be trying this, I'll update ❤
Okay your hair is long but you need a trim !!!
I forgot to ask you what kind of rice that you can use for your hair does it matter what rice bags that we use if you can read a text me back
What kind of lavender do you put on your hair and where can you get it can you pick get one at Walmart tell me what kind is it is it the lavender how to make your house smell good or what kind of lavender is it lavender oil
It also works if you get the tin foil to fit over your top set of teeth,lay them both in front of you, and. Put tooth paste half way down the tinfoil, spread it out on the tin foil with a tooth brush, and sprinkle some teeth whitening charcoal on top , then mix it in with the tooth brush , add a dot of tooth paste on top mix it in,then put them both on your teeth and leave for five minutes (it might be a bit messy so do it over the sink and clean up after😂) after you’ve done that , rinse your mouth out with water and then brush your teeth with your normal toothpaste after, you’ll see a difference straight away but a quite small one if you keep doing it over time you’ll notice a massive difference this method was made by me
Can you use coconut oil instead of other oils? And are you supposed to leave it in your hair?
is it okay if I don't boil the water?

Ok so like 5-6 months ago I shaved my hair, so I hated it and wanted it to be long, but could never go past the ugly awkward phase. After many times of reshaving my hair I'm sick of it and idc if it's gonna go through the ugly phase I want long hair again. So here I am October 20: i watched this video, I am currently soaking the rice water, it's night time rn so imma keep soaking it until the morning and wash my hair with it tomorrow. I will update everyone few days and let y'all know if it works
When I first saw this i thought these people don't believe in scissors but I've tried it and it works great..smells to high heavens but really really works..add the scent oils and you're good...great honest video

I like your hair
I’m sorry your hair looks very unhealthy. You should try and cut it the ends looks rough and splitting.
To all the people saying she needs a trim or needs to cut her hair:  SHE’S A SIKH AND TRULY FOLLOWS HER ARTICLES OF FAITH LIKE WE’RE SUPPOSED TO. ONE OF WHICH IS UNCUT HAIR. (Look up Sikhism cuz half the world doesn’t know we exist when we’re everywhere 😒)  ALOT of people are unaware of this religion but she’s a sikh and so am I and people who truly follow Sikhism follow it’s articles of faith one of which is uncut hair. I’ve had uncut hair for the longest and yeah it looks like you need a trim but it’s totally on the person if they want to cut it or not, to make it look even or whatever it is that the other might think. I cut my hair after months or years if I want to get rid of split ends but most of the time I keep my long hair. It’s the same case with her. So stop telling her what to do it’s her hair. If she wants it longer shes gonna make it longer with that rice water 😤  thanks.
Cut those dead ends
I will defintly try that. Best wishes from. Canada🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🙏🇨🇦💗💗🇨🇦😘

People prob won’t see this but does this make you hair go back to normal once you stop using it? Idk I’ve heard of the eyelash Vaseline thing and if you stop using the baseline it goes back to normal. Ikr I was just wondering if it was the same with this.

Oml I used the rice water... not only did it grow my hair a cm each time I use it, but almost completely took out all of the remains of my hair dye. I'm so happy because I needed that to happen so I wouldn't get in trouble at school. I think the starch faded the colour out.

It's also rich in arsenic and carbaryl and whatever else is contained in pesticides so no thanks. Not for me. Hope it works for everyone else though.
WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE
ok I’m gonna try it and I’ll update  I’m starting on September 14th, I’m growing out a pixie btw  September 15th: just tried it and no notable growth yet but it makes your hair so soft and stuff  September 20th: has thickened a bit and seems to have grown a little since the first spray!  September 21st: just made a new batch and I’m probably going to leave it in overnight so I’ll tell u what happens  October 1st: i’ve noticed a bit of hair growth! not insane like everyone says but i feel like my hair has gotten a lot healthier so even if this didn’t work as much as to grow it i think it made my hair feel a lot better
وحنا مالنا شعرنا مايطول كيفهم 😕😕
You going get lice too tho
You have to cut the ends of your hair to look better end healthier
for healthy hairs
does it works ???
Then the spray bottle is useless.
It works people
you should cut like half of i tho, its very damaged
Can you spray the rice water every night ? Do you have to wash it off with shampoo if you apply it...or can u just rinse it off?
Wooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww Soooooo long hairs
If don't use the lavender oil has problem
The
It is genetic....we northeast Indians have it by birth. You are using it incorrectly
One thing that happened to me while  growing my hair long is that I didn't go in for regular trims and the split ends kept splitting upwards and I had to get so much more length cut than I wanted to. Now I learned my lesson lol 🤦🏻‍♀️
I did this for 15 days andI still do this, my hair keeps growing so well 👍🏽☺️
I watched this because it looks satasfying
Anyone just save the video to learn how to put their hair in a bun like that 😂
I wish she would've cut her hair before this and gave us a an update to see if it actually worked.
Its not the rice...its the scalp massage that makes it grow
Does it work for all types of hair?
How many days tho?
Girl Ur hair is already long enough!

Can this be applied to beards? 🙄
I regret cutting my hair, Does anyone know if this works?
Are u Lebanese 🤔

Am I the only one watching this picking a small piece of glass out my foot 😂
Gimme ur hair
Do you need to cook the rice?
I tried this and it works!!! I started on July 29th and my hair is WAY longer now. It's almost to my bottom!  *it was originally a little bit below my shoulders.
Some9en immediate help me  I watched a video few weeks ago to teum hair and today i did but it's wrong my long hair is some is to my half back the rest is ab9ve my waist help ! It looks normal in plait, or ponytaik but I'm to leave the shorter bits grow out or cut it all even, but I'm scared I'll do it wrong!
OMG you are so pretty and so is your hair
I tried it very nice sister
But does it work for black ppl hair
I'm gonna grow my hair out in the fall time so my neck stays warm for winter and to stay cool for summer I can cut my hair for spring! Lol
Does children can use it
Only difference is I don’t boil it.
i’ve tried this a couple times and this most definitely works! i cut my curly hair when it was straightened to about my shoulders and weeks later i wanted to grow me hair back out. i didn’t mess with my hair or anything for about 8 months. i used rice water , hair growth drops, caster oil and used hair masks. my hair grew to about my shoulder blades and i was super happy with the results. i really recommend that if you want your hair to grow don’t straighten it, curl it or  use anything with heat. i hope this helps you guys!
I just cut down my 45 cm long hairs...and now I'm watching this...
Only yellow type of rice??
How long have you been growing it for

tHE WAY SHE PUT HER BUN UP WAS SO COOL
It works for me and I have loose curls and usually my hair is fairly dry but  now it’s very moisturized and my hair  has grown quiet I a bit I’ve been doing this for about 4 weeks!amazing

Man this better work
Why do some people have to be so mean/negative towards others? She is sharing something that could help you. And, all you can say is, "You need to trim your hair". Do you realize how you sound? Apparently, she must have a full, happy life, and something called self-esteem because she seems to be a pretty positive person. On the other hand, all of you  bothered about her hair need to mind your own business and get a life. Maybe you should work on your own self-esteem, and stop being so critical of others. She didn't post the video asking for any advice. She looks like she's doing a great job without any of your negative advice. She's busy making videos and you are sitting around watching her video telling her what she needs to do to her hair. 😂😂😂
W
Can it works for a Boy
Its ok to use white rice?
Does it work for bald guys
*reads what happened with other people*  MA! DO WE HAVE RICE!?
nice split ends
Who’s here after cutting bangs  and they made u look like a horse 😪
After reviewing the video I finally did it the same way she suggested, I also added coconut oil for the smell because the rice water smell didn't sit well with me, and no bs in the last 3 months I got almost 3 inches and breakage is gone also... However it doesn't help for split ends so I cut my splits ends and boy I've never been happier with my hair, I'm Puerto Rican so my hair is naturally curly also I stop dying and straightening my hair!!!!! It's been almost 6 months now and I grown a total of roughly 5 and a half inches my hair is almost past my butt now☺🙃😍I do it twice a week exactly as the video shows and the days I don't do the rice water I wash with head and shoulders dandruff shampoo. I will continue this for as long as I'm breathing Thanks🙏🙇
does it work? It does not work for me.
I'm scared to try it cause a video said not to use it .~.
Mashallah
Does anybody else wish they had a hair designer to take care and style their hair everyday ?

Can I use this rice water  another day by keeping in freeze or somewhere else???
Hi.How many centimeters did your hair grow in one month?
Can you use any rice or is there a preference?  We usually buy calrose rice but should I use the long grained rice instead?
Boil water kill nutrients right?
Who else has tried this and is so disappointed but loved to try it 😂🤣
I have long hair it goes under my butt and its very curly
Is the rice cooked or raw
I'm here after impulsivily cutting my hair

please muge ghatya hacks mat bhega karo police complaint Kar dogi bal sare loss ho gaye Hain
Next thing you know you're keeping your hair up in a bun 24/7
Can I effectively use rice water without boiling it, but only soaking the rice?
Bkwaaasssss bndddd😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Nice https://youtu.be/_sif6GqXRp0
My hair use to be that long my sister cut it and gave my hair to lost of love
Removing the powder from the rice only stops your hair growing faster because of the powder and how much protein and vitamins it has in it, you don't have to wait 24 hours for the rice water, you can boil it and take the water out.. and also to give the rice water a pleasing scent you can add orange peels and leave the rice water in for like weeks and you will see the difference.

Edit:3 days to go but I took the picture when I straightened my hair so after 3 days I'll straight and see... Edit:so welcome back.. i straightened it so I think it did grow an inch but I'll edit when I see an difference Edit:it's been like 2 weeks but I don't see a difference like it's my own bad hair I am very sad I'll see you guys after a week and see the difference 😊

You don't need to boil it you can just let the rice sit for 24 hours then drain the water out of the rice and keep the water  Hence rice water
I truly loved your video, great job! don't wish to be irritating but yet this web-site *EasyLaptopLife. Com* ended up being an actual blessing for my family and I am positive most your viewers can find it very helpful. Be blessed!

Ab or kitana barhana hai Baal???????
Your hair is so long you dont need an elastic???? Sign me up
I’m gonna make this and once Its done I’ll let ya’ll know...  Use 1: sorry, took a while to actually get stuff, but I made it a few days ago, used it last night and the following day not much of a difference yet, but no shock there  Use 2: a few days later, I used it again last night and it’s defiantly made it shinier, no growth yet tho :(  Use 3: my hair has actually grew, not drastically, but I deffo noticed a bit And a warning: deffo try to use some cent oil or something cause it STINKS xD  Use 4: it’s been yet a few more nights and my hair has grew at least an inch, it’s pretty good and the shine on my hair is amazing! I’m not saying my hairs grew down to my ankles but I have 100% noticed a difference in growth and health  And another warning: make sure the rice water jar is closed TIGHT cause if it’s not it’ll stink out ur room lmao xD  Use 5: I haven’t been using it every time I’ve washed my hair, just putting it out there Anyways my hair has only grew about an inch but considering I’m using the way I am, it’s pretty good tbh. My hair has gotten way healthier (like I mentioned) but I’ve noticed a difference every time I’ve used it, just make sure u wash it out fully  And like I’ve mentioned if u haven’t used a cent, HOLD YOUR NOSE, it stinks🤣  Use 6: my hairs genially grew on its own by now but I’m not gonna lie it has speeded the growth up and made it healthier but tbh if only use this water for health improvement
Masha'a Allah , beautiful hair 😍😍😍

It works but it stinks 😷
What kind of rice can I use?
I'm totally trying this, my hair grows super slow and has never been longer than 22in. I just trimmed it so now it's 19in, I'll try to update every week or so 🙂 July 9- first application, I don't really notice a difference in growth or texture yet July 20- okay so basically I was at camp for a week so I couldn't use rice water, but a day before then my hair started to feel super silky. That silkiness lasted through the week, so if you're just trying to get healthy hair you can just use it once a week
Looking deciet nice hair insight I walk by faith
What type of shampoo can we use for wash hair after 20mins?

what was name of this rice
I love long hairs  but I don't have this .
I'm gonna try this. I don't know if this works but I'm gonna update everytime I use the mixture so that evryone can know about it effects. I won't lie, cause I know how it feels to search for a remedy like this. So...  27/06/2019: I washed an almost full cup of Jasmin rice, I'm leaving the mixture (almost 1 cup of rice + almost 1 cup of water) for 24h as she says.  28/06/2019: I boiled the mixture and added a few drops of herbs essential oil (it contains 31 different herbs so I don't know its name, but I would recommend to use peppermint essential oil because I once read that it can increase hair growth). Without the oil the mixture stinks a little. I measured a specific part of my hair, so that I can be sure to always measure the same part. It's length currently is 54cm. I'm going to spray the mixture on my scalp and leave it overnight.  29/06/2019: the mixture didn't make my hair neither greasy nor stinky. I've measured the same piece of hair and its length is still 54cm. I'm going to apply the mixture every night. If I see any progress within a week I'll do weekly updates.  30/06/2019: its length is now almost 54,5, hope this is not an illusion 😂. Btw hair stinks when you first apply the mixture but the smell slowly fades away while it dries. I'm going to wash my hair today.  01/07/2019: I washed my hair yesterday morning and applied the mixture before going to sleep. I can confirm that it doesn't make your hair dirty, greasy, or smelly. I measured the piece of hair. It's length is a little bit more than 54,5cm  02/07/2019: a bit longer than 55cm  03/07/2019: same as yesterday. However my hair seems to be heltier
Can it be white rice

Plz bato mam
Lamander oil Kya matlab hai
Hello! I have just made the rice water and I am very excited to try it! I will be honest and tell you if it works or not.  Day 1: 06-15-19, my hair is 9 and a half inches long (pretty short) first time trying it   Day 2:- I applied the water to my hair. I left it in for about an hour and then washed it out. I didn’t brush my hair out at all before I went to bed. When I awoke, I brushed my hair. I noticed that it was very easy to brush out. I didn’t really notice anything else. I will tell you if I see anything in a week! June 24: ( sorry I haven’t updated I’ve been busy) anyway my hair has grown an inch.thats right an inch. I’ve only used it for a week!!! This stuff works. I will continue to update you. Once again sorry I haven’t updated in an exact week. ~: next update:~ in a month! July 26th! Thank you for reading!❤️😄   So umm.. I kinda ran out of rice water and I’m really busy this week so umm....  •~|update 3•~| I have been doing it for a month (off and on Bc I forget things) and my hair has grown 1 and a half inches!!!! I am very happy with my results and I will continue to use it!     What I used: I just used 5 minute rice and tap water.
Which rice mam
You have severly damaged hair and needs cutting half of it or at least up to shoudlers  I'm a hairdresser. So sad you ruined such a big part of your hair.
2    0       1          9             ?
She already has long hair
They say rosemary oil is the best essential oil for hair growth. I'm going to try it with rosemary oil. Twice a week I do coconut oil with rosemary oil and I spend a lot of time massaging my scalp. I think it's helped a lot but I still want to try the rice water.
Thanku sis ...  its really work
I have found an bottle that consists 50 of the best herbs and natural oils that help with hair loss and strengthens the scalp  all in one bottle.

Here is a links to purchase the bottles that also comes with 60 DAYS MONEY BACK GUARANTEE.  http://www.amazon.com/AL-SHAAFI-50Plus-Herbal-bottle-GUARANTEE/dp/B00GE4T95I

I hate when.people do these videos  lol it's a good way to get a million views....but its bs ...and yes I'm an idiot for watching  a second  of it Haha
Which oil
Woah how do you stand having such long hair
Wait what oil is that
ok I don't want to do this
My family is lazy and just uses microwave rice😂😂
My hair is already long and it comes to my ass and by the way I’m 14
There is nothing like 1 ingredient for hair growth cause it's just mostly genetic so this method can only help to a small extent (I have long hair that's why I'm telling my thoughts about it)
In one month will it grow long
In how many days
We have to wash hair after applying this remedy
How do l have to use it for l miss my long hair so much.  I just made some please tell me does it really work
What happened if u don't  cover
Ok how many times do you use  it
What happens if i let this on my hair all night?
What would happened if u used it every single day would it grow even more or would it rewin it xx
Hope it works
Can I microwave it?
Koi mjh urdu m yeh totka bataega mjh samjh nhn ayi 😔

Is it necessary to boil the water...i kept rice in water for  more than 24 hours...n use it without boiling
Will it work with shaved hair cause I shaved my hair and I want my hair back but like really long and pretty
But our rice is white
The thickness of my hair has reduced to half because of my hairfall😭😭😢😢😢
will it reduce haifall
I got an asian mum so there’s rice every day for dinner butttt I don’t want long hair Why? 1. It takes longer to wash 2. Would be very knotty 3. Very dirty 4. Waste of shampoo and conditioner 5. U would sit on it 6. When ur on the toilet it will go inside (even if u put ur hair to the side there’s always those few strands that go inside) (would defiantly happen when ur asleep) 7. It gets in the way 8. You have to brush it like every minute IS THAT ENOUGH REASONS FOR WHY U SHOULD GET LONG HAIR??
WHEN U GO TO THE TOILET IT WILL GO INSIDE THE TOILET
Which rice is this?
Oil is the best remedy, I don't believe in any other.
Cool
*G* *E* *N* *E* *T* *I* *C* *S*
does it work with dyed hair ❔
XD can I just say this has been popping up and I'm about to cut my hair really short and I have long hair soooo  Edit: also just hearing how people in the comments are saying that they regret cutting there hair is making me nervous the only reason I wanna cut my hair is because I am not happy with being a female so I'm cutting my hair to feel more like a boy
I gotta give this a try, my hair is getting thinner by the day.
Cool :) I hope this works :)
i dont like super long hair because  you may catch lice or dandruff
Hi

Also, will this work if I go to the pool everyday? My swim team just started, and does this mean I need to take a shower everyday?
Does the type of rice matter? 'Cause my family usually eats brown rice.

instead of using lavendar we can use coconut oil or not
Wouldn't boiling it reduce its nutrition?
Anyone saying she needs to cut her hair; can you not?? She seems happy with it long, and that's all that matters.
Dont se rice water you’re forcing the hair to grow and might cause damage as it grows by its self
How do you live with that hair?
Does this work for natural curly hair
I tried this method last year and it works and now, I’m trying it again because I’ve been having hair fall this past few weeks.
Sis what i felt is you have to cut the edges it's looking damaged
I'm trying this now, because when i had a mental breakdown i cutted them soo short .. I look like my name's anja lmao But yeah, it looks terrible i'm trying this now. I am happy about every inch it grows😅

**ariana grande has entered the chat**

Sb bakeas hai
It's not the way....put water in rice over night don't boil...next day take the water from the rice put it in your hair root...don't wash....let the water dry in your hair....after completely dry then wash your hair....it won't work if you boil it....
Hey! 👋 So I am a 14 old girl in California and I am trying this! Will keep You Updated!!!  Wednesday May 29 - Hair: 21 inches:    I made the water, put in spray bottle, sprayed and massaged hair. Left for 30 minutes then showered. I put a little coconut oil in the spray bottle and mixed them together. Make sure to put an essential oil or extract so your hair doesn’t smell. Will update in a week!
Ok her hair is so beautiful and long but she Lowkey needs a haircut 💇
Ok welp since everyone else is sharing their updates and them trying it out,why not, and btw I’m starting tmr I’m just waiting for it to ferment.Wish me luck.I have tried to rice water before and I have not really been checking it on a regular basis to see if it’s working but I think it has grown my hair. *How to make it* First I got brown rice and put it in a plastic container  Next I washed it in the sink two times and rinsed out than one more time with purified water then I rinsed it out  Then I poured In the purified water with the rice and mixed it all up in the container and pushing down on the rice to break up the rice. Lastly I put foil over it and I’m letting it sit for 24 hours Come back tmr afternoon for another update   May 29:watched the video
It works
Who else regrets cutting their hair..
I’m Chinese but still don’t have long hair
Ur hair is   very beautiful
That's amazing idea but one small question which rice we can use here I can see yellow  colour rice
What type of rice do we have to use?
this does work but a lot of people are saying that you should NOT boil it. you will end up burning the vitamins that helps your hair grow.
Ima try it when my mom leaves for work😝😝
Umm does it work for like 12 year and 11 year olds or 13 year olds?
Does the water need to be warm or cold? At the begging
Me: hey dad do you know how to get long hair?      My dad: how?  Me: rice water My dad: wut?  Me: I need rice and water  My dad: your probably gonna be bald when you wake up Me:daaadd I’m NOT it works for 100%

wow, you have so beautiful long hair.I love it.I use Rice Water now for about 3 Months and my hair has grown.I intend to use the Rice Water for a few years, because I wanna have very long hair myself.My goal is 5 feet length.

Ima get sum on fleek ponytails after I do this with my mom
Your hair most definitely needs a trim.
I wonder does it work for boys 🤔
Hold up I need a tutorial on how she does her buns like guuurrrlll that’s so much cooler
I’ve tried it and haven’t seen any results, but when I did try it it made my hair very dry. If you do try this don’t do it everyday maybe once a week when you’re about to wash your hair Bc it takes all the protein from your hair
I am sure this also wont work on stubborn hair . I give up . Trying to be happy in my bomb blasted unmanagable dry short hair.. duh 😣
can i do it too with tape in extensions?
I’m definitely doing this!

Hm, makes me wonder if my hair grows so fast because I have hard water. (High mineral content) I bleach my hair platinum blonde and I can see my root growth within a week. But I might try this as a weekly mask instead of every day.
What? Don’t cut it?
but washing your hair everyday isn't good tho?...
Omg yes I love your hair and my hair is very long too it's like already pass my butt and all my friendsove to touch my hair and comb it for me and I love it, one of my friends call me repunzel lol. I Love your videos

You can eat rice instead of putting it in ur hair dum dum
How to grow your hair longer     Don't cut it 😁

I have a question....can it be any kind of rice?
How often do we do it?
Is long but is not beautiful.
Can we sleep with it?
Oh my god sameeee I love the tangle brush thingy it works so well with my hair
What kind of rice do you recommend??
For how many days do u have to use this to see results?
The only reason why one would want to grow their hair to that extend is to use it to wipe their ass.
What kind of rice any rice or a type of it
Woah her hair is gorgeous!
Is it a shampoo? A serum? No! Its genetics! ;)
do u need a specific kind of rice?
So i want to try this i will update but now i must wait 24h sooo
I'm trying it. I'm going to apply it once a week  1st application: 17/5/19 hair feels soft but frizzy. Haven't noticed any change in my hair growth.  2nd application: 23/5/19
Do you use this before or after shampoo and conditioner?
Can I wash my hair with the rice water
If your hair is protein sensitive, *DON'T DO IT*
Thank you
On average it will grow .5 inch a month. I'd like see videos of how many days and tape measurements of some sort for more of an accurate proof. Can you do that next time around please? Some people can't grow hair like others due to genetic, lack of nutrients etc...I don't use rice for my hair or anything special yet it grows long & thick. No, I don't take Vitamins of any sort either. Lol. Guess I'm just one of the lucky gals. :)
When black ppl say their hair is the strongest and most beautiful 🤮🤮 South Asian hair is so long, thick and healthy.
Day 1: I did this and washed it out with a little bit shampoo & conditioner  *Next day* I didn't brushed my hair in the morning.. MY HAIR ARE SOOO SOFT!
Don't they use neem
Can you put perfume in it??
You're using my favorite thing from an Arabic store :OO for the cup or jar
U need a hair cut girl ..... ends tabahhh huway way baloon k
If I just buy horchata and spray it into my hair does this still work 😂😂😂😂🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
Gonna try this remedy out and sure I'll be honest with you guys.  May 16, Watched the video. May 17 tried it. I allowed the water to stay for 9-10 hrs approx and then applied it the way she suggested and after 30 mins washed it with shampoo. When my hair was 3/4 dry, I applied aloe vera liquid throughout ( slightly) to help nourish my hair and straighten it.  Of course, I did not expect magic to happen but my hairs look shiny and silky. 19 May,  I did something different last night. I applied rice water on my hairs and allowed it to stay there for two hours then applied a lot of coconut oil and slept like that. Then in the morning I washed it all out with a shampoo and then allowed my hairs to dry a little then again washed it with rice water. As advised, I let it stay for 30 mins then washed it out. I don't know about growth but surely my hair is a lot more manageable than before, it's silky, smooth, shiny and looks way more bouncy. I'll totally recommend this even if you don't want hair growth, it's still good for healthy hairs. May 21:- well, my hairs are pretty much same as I described earlier. Yes they did grew a little and I mean little. Other than I'll still recommend it cause I really loved it. June 16:- Well as I said, I'll be honest so I'll let you guys know that I was distracted for a week or so, so you can take this one as a 3-week update.  Anyway, getting back to point, Hair growth, 6 inches, yup, you read that right. This thing really works. You won't notice it but others do. Next, my hair is way healthier than before, the shine is still their and about dryness, so because of coconut oil I never faced any problem. It's effective. Totally recommend. I hope you guys give it a try as well. 😉😊
Do you have to wash it out? Cant i just spray it into my hair and leave it in until the next time i wash my hair??  Because washing your hair everyday is bad for my hair so i wash it like every 2-3 days. Its long but i want it longer! Please reply on if its neccesary to wash out!!
Can i use Olive oil for the oil? pls answer. I Regret cutting my Hair. GOSHH
No need to waste rice because my mother cook rice and everytime she wash the rice  Me:MOM CAN I HAVE THAT  Mom:WHERE Me:THE WATER WASH IN RICE BECAUSE YOU JUST DUMPING IT
The main ingredient is ethnicity, sit down.
Cold or warm, or hot water ? Please
Is there any particular rice required to do this? Does any rice work better than others?
Why i hate her hair...
Your hair not looks healthy ;( , expecially the lightbrown ends
Wait so how long does it take? Do u do it in the morning and evening or just before a shower?
How long can i keep the water in the bottle? Or how often do i have to make this solution i only eat rice once a week. I tried it and the water began to go off in the bottle 🤢
Is it only essential oil or any other oil
We should do this before we have a bath or after we have a bath?
Will this help with hair fall? And our hair definitely won't break right?
Do I really have to wait for it to sit for 24 hours? :(( You know what Imma make it sig for 7 hours Lmao Imma tell u guys if it still works.
Boiling it gets rid of the nutrients doesn’t it?
how come you’re not telling people that it can damage there texture and there hair? 🤨

Do we have to boil it?
Its really good.my mum said it had worked well
Instead of using a brush whilst your hair is wet I suggest using a wide tooth comb; so then you don't rip healthy (not dead) follicles out of your scalp. The only strands of hair that should fall out of your head are the dead ones.    [If lots of strands fall out; there may be something wrong with your thyroid and you should tell your doctor. Or if an over abundance of hair grows in unnecessary places, that's also a sign of a thyroid problem.]
She already has very long hair, hard to tell if this works. She needs to shave it all off and do it to make me a believer, I mean she swears it works.
Do you do this before or after washing your hair?
Daily we have to apply nd hair wash doing?
How should we store it ??
I’m going to try this every time before I go shower , my hair is at 23 inches (58 cm). I’m going to keep it in my hair for an hour even though it’s supposed to be in for 20 minutes. Next update is on Saturday or Sunday  Helooooo so my hair is still the same length nothing really changed So im going to do it again for another week and I’ll update on Saturday or Sunday    Hii , SOoOo I’m still at 23 inches and I’m just gonna keep doing it until something happens and see how long it takes for my hair to grow, everyone’s hair is different so it might be faster or slower for you. Next update is on Sunday.
This does not work instead it makes your hair fall off
I have a question. Who many times a week or a month do I need to do this? Please someone reply 😊. Thank you if you do.

This does 100% work! I Tried it for a bit and you can see noticeably longer hair
I am going to try this and i'll be 100% honest with all of you. I'll keep you posted.  Edit one, May 5th 2019: I applied the mask on my hair and washed it. My hair is really soft and smells like vanilla because of the essential oil I used and it seems a tiny tiny bit longer so that's a good sign!
Cool thanks so much😊

We hv also seen the story abt China's rapenzal village 🤣🤣
My hair is already long....but I want to thickness in my hair
I tried this and I think it worked but still. My hair is currently 50cm long and curly and my goal is 70/75cm. Here are the results of my first try: March 1st: I did it and now my hair is drying, I am not drying my hair with a hair dryer. My hair is finally dry and here are the results: Before: 50cm After: 51cm I think it worked but I am not sure I will try again and hopefully I will see a better result. I will update you If I don't forget. :) March 5th: Before: 52cm After: 53cm So I don't know if it is suppose to grow 1cm every time but it is working even though it's not so noticable cause I have curly hair but I guess when it will grow more it will be more noticable, I aswell noticed that my hair has a more like a silky feel when you touch the hair so I guess that's a good thing. So I think that there's some progress but it's not so noticable. I will update you soon! ❤️ March 8th: Before: 55cm After: 57cm So this time I massaged my hair for 3 minutes instead of 5 minutes I as well left the rice water in my hair for 25 minutes and I think this time I got better results than the other times so next time I willl wash my hair I will massage it for 3 minutes and let it sit for 25 minutes. I noticed that is has a more silky feel than the last time and it looks more puffy. So yeah I will update you again! ❤️ March 12th: Before: 57cm After:  So I did again and I forgot to measure the after but I think it's fine. I think that now it is more noticable that it is longer like you can see the change but not so much. I can see that my hair is getting more silky and shiny. Witch I think it's a good thing. So yeah I will update you again next time! ❤️ March 15th: Before: 58 After: I forgot to measure the after again. But you can definitely notice that my hair has grown and now I am really happy about it. 😀  I will still continue doing this and hope for bigger results. I will update you if I won't forget. ❤️ March 29th:  I washed my hair today but I didn't use use the rice water because I didn't have time to make it yesterday. But my hair is growing pretty healthy and it has a really silky and soft texture, now I am really happy with the results,  I won't stop using this remedy until I get to my wanted length. So yes my hair grew and it has a really soft and silky feel witch makes it feel like cotton.
It works
Wow here hair is beautiful ❤❤
So I really want to do this.. but I’m using rice called minute rice and the rice isn’t sinking to the bottom like it is in the video so I’m not sure if it’s gonna work or not :( also it isn’t a milky colour so maybe I’m using the wrong rice?
How many of you are scrolling in the comments to look for a result
please someone that knows should please reply
hello should you use it for a month
Kepo
Oh my god you have the most beautiful hair ever!😁🤩🙌
Why didn’t you just dump your hair in it
Who's here because the barber cut off your hair wayy too short!!
Thank you
very easy hope it works
Tangle teasers break off the hair. They leave strands of hair within the bristles. Picks are the best for detangling. Also, you never use such things as tangle teasers when hair is wet or damp. Hair is weaker when wet or damp and breaks off easily.
I will be trying this tonight so if you wanna know if it works i'll give you an update each day I try it! (Right now my hair is 18in)  *Day 1*-No growth yet *Day 2*- It grew a little bit, i'd say like .2 inches
Do you have to wait 24 hours can't u just wait 7
I started using this method because my hair was a little bit down my back and I wanted it longer so I tried it for 1 month my hair was 20 inches and after a month of using it it’s now 29 inches
Do we need to use brown rice
Rice water actually destroys your hair 😡😡😡
Should we apply shampoo
Did you straightened  your hair after applying the rice water?
What type of rice
I love longer hair.
😭😭😭does it actually work because my hair is very stubborn and refuses everything i try because i even tried onion juice and it's not showing any signs of improvement  😭😭HELP!!😭i got curly short stubborn  African hair😭😭😭
What rice is that
Do u know what the rice water can do for dandruff
if you have curly hair and you still want your curls permanently DONT DO THIS it removes all you curls and I have waited 2 weeks and my curls have not come back
My mum is a fucking bitch and won’t let me have the rice how about that
I've cut my hair bc I had so many split ends. But some of the split ends are still there and I hate it. It I cut my hair again it will be above my shoulders and that a no no. So I'm going to try this and grow my hair so I can cut it sooner I will try to keep an update !!!
I don’t know if you’ll get back to me, but should I leave my hair naturally curly or should I straighten it when applying? Great video!
Good know about youre video, NO NEED TO TAKE A BATH just spray is enough. Lol
Mam can I use Rosemary essential oil instead of what you used??

I remember watching this when I got a shitty hair cut, here are some tips  1. Massage your hair ( put some coconut oil in your hair if you’d like.) 2. Drink 3 - 5 bottles of water a day 3. Take biotin  4. Get hair growing shampoo  5. Wash your hair with semi cold water 6. Put Aloe Vera in your hair 7. Buy hair masks 8. Brush your hair well     P.s I mean it when I say drink lots of water it really helps.
Who else is looking in the comments to see if this actually works😂definitely me

I'd rather just keep cutting my hair that looks un even
Am I the only one who’s hair just doesn’t grow👊🏼😔
Is this really works???!!
does it work only only on virgin hair
Should we apply shampoo or not plz reply
I want hair knee length its currently tail bone length but it's dropping / shedding....it's  not dropping  to much .....any suggestions
I like long hair, but it makes me look shorter than I already am... but I love putting it in a ponytail and like being able to swing it around sksk  I’m weird
This made my life 1,00,000,000,000% better
I scrolled down the comments to see if it actually worked but nobody said if it worked or not.
Dose it smell bad??
Got a side shave and now kinda regret it 🤷🏻‍♀️😂😂

Well you need to dye your hair in red.. Because you just stole Dave’s Hair! Well if you guys dont know him yet, Boyinaband is his name.. he makes a video with pewdiepie... and he upload a video. The title is Don’t stay in school
حد عربي😂😂
You're beautiful but you're hair is weighing you down. It's really dry. Cut it to your waist and mermaid braid it, it will look great on you.
Hey ladies & gents! Fun fact- #1 cause of hair loss is, lack of silica in the body. FOOD GRADE Diatomaceous Earth will do wonders for your hair, nails & skin. Do your research! My hair is long & extremely thick! It takes me 45 min to wash & I cut & highlight my own hair because, every stylist I've ever had says I have the most hair they've ever seen.  I've never been in a salon for less than 8hrs!! I do my own hair because others just can't handle it!! Look up Diatomaceous Earth, be sure it's FOOD GRADE!! It has so many health benefits besides long thick hair.  Hope this helps someone! God Bless!❤❤
What kind of rice? Does it matter?
I am gonna try this.. thanks fr this video..

I have a question, how do you make your hair long when already cut (girls)
OMG IT WORKED😲
https://youtu.be/c-6fRfBIYSw Good hair ! Insta @daniel.giniel.ivy
Omg
hello . i think that the rice is not natural because we buy it from the supermarket  anyways thank you for the recipe
Omg it actually works my hair grew 6 inches im so happy right now
Does it have to be a specific type of RICE 🍚🧐?
Can you use any type of rice?
her hair is beautiful ,I'm going to buy it 😂🤷
It worked my hair it's like 10cm wow
Bruh I'm too lazy to do that😩
I saw this on a Doctors site all she did was put 1 cup of rice and 1 cup if water in a bowl and let it sit 12-24 hrs. She did say the long you let it set the better. Then she said to wash your hair as usual and condition it then add the rice water and leave on for 30 -60 minute then wash out. She said you can put a shower cap on if you don't want to stay in the shower for an hour. Then after 30-60 minutes just rinse out. She said she been doing it for years. I think her name is Debbie Williams. I saw it just before this one. Not boiling it. I'm going to put some in a Mason jar and let it sit 24hrs then do it this weekend. I will let you know if it works. I was my hair every 2 day. That's what I was told to do. I do use anything other than shampoo and conditioner no other products.  I had breast cancer over 13yrs ago so I'm good with taking care if my hair now. No more dyeing it. Just letting the grays come in. Oh I'm 54 now. I was 40 when I had breast cancer.
I I w I wa I wan I want  I want t I want to  I want to t I want to tr I want to try  I want to try t I want to try th  I want to try thi  I want to try this
WHo will try this
I'll try to update everyday.
Can you use white rice only?
Lel hi so I'mma try this out,I'll edit this comment every week so leave a reply so I can like it and then you can keep up with this comment:
Why TF does this women still do this, she has longer hair than my whole body!😔
Hii so i am actually in the process of doing this method! So i will be doing an update time to time! Right now i have to wait an hour and then 24 hours🙈 But i’ll update you soon 😊 Edit 1: So i am currently in the process of leaving the rice water in the jar for a few hours so yeah Edit 2: So i have put it in a little bottle and and i am going to spray it on my hair and etc ( i did not boil it because it would evaporate, so after this and a shower another update!) Edit 3: So it has been at least 2 days and my hair has grown a tiny bit which is actually surprising 🥴 so this does work
CAN WE NOt boil the water? Can we like put it under a candle?
I've done this before, it does improve the strength and shine of your hair, so in that aspect yes it does work if used consistently. However, you should keep the jar loosely closed, like just set the lid on top, don't screw it on. Leave it for at least 3 days, at most 7 days (depending on your climate). It should smell slightly sour. Leaving rice in the water will make the fermentation process take longer. Do not heat the water after fermentation, it will kill all the good bacteria you just created. Also, dilute the rice water by half as it's pretty acidic if you let it ferment well, and you can either use as a spray on mask or rinse after shampoo and conditioner. Hope this helps!
I have very longgg and thiccc hair and I tricked I’ve always used as a child was my mom would put my hair in a braid to sleep and that is what made it longer.
Hey y’all coconut oil works amazing for growing hair as well!

الله يعطيك الصحة 🌹 وووووووووووووو 👍💜💜🌰🌰🥞🥦🥬🥬🥬🥬🥦🥦🥞🥐🥐⁦🌶️🥐🥐😁😁🥒🌰🥒🌽🥯🥞🥞🍔🥦🥬🥬🥬🥬🥦🥦🥞🥞
I've been doing this for 1 week now and I am starting to see some growth. I'm going to try this for a month and see what happens.  Update: I've been slacking lately but when I was doing this my hair only grew maybe 1cm.(1-2 inches overnight yeah okay😂) I'm going to start up again soon and try to be.   consistent with it. I did notice that it makes you scalp kinda dry and my scalp was already dry, but just a heads up.
the ends are too damaged pls cut it it looks like a broom no offence xD
Plz tell home remedy for straight hair
Anyone here to scroll the comments to see if it works?😁😁😁
I tried some last night and I think it may have worked? Then again, my hair was wet the second time I measured it... Still hopeful though!
Thank goodness i found this i really want to grow my hair fast
With her long hair she can play rapunzel.Her mother will be Mother Gothel and she will be rapunzel. 😄
Will rice water make my hair fuller or thicker ?
Is white rice ok?
My aunt has more longer hair than them
Does this work?
Does this actually work
IM SCROLLIND DOWN THE COMMENTS TO SEE IF IT WORKS AND NO ONE COMMENTS!!😠🤦🏽‍♀️
muy lindo cabello
and how long should you wait to see results
can I use monoi oil in the rice water when I'm done making it?
I didn't even watch it
Scrolling down to see weather it's TRUE?? Same here😎
Who else is looking down the comments section to see if it's work .

Can v store it?
OML THIS WORKED! Since I have curly hair it made my curly hair 4 inches longer!
girl you need to cut your hair at least 5 to 6 inches
This actually works!!!! Ive been doing it on and off though but I can tell you from the week that I did it everyday it grew about 1/2 an inch. Just in two month its grown 2 1/4 inches & my hair normally grows 1/4-1/2 inch every month. Also I personally didn't like the idea of wasting rice so I reuse the rice and it works pretty well still, my hair is also super soft. Feels like virgin hair. Though, it's kind of a pain doing this everyday but its honestly so worth it. Makes your hair grow faster and its equivalent to buying expensive hair products because it srsly makes your hair so healthy and smooth.
I'm quite curious about how short your hair was before rice water and how long it took you to grow it out to this length.
When you wash your hair can use conditioner
Literally all these comments say, “WHo’S sCrolliNg tO sEe iF tHiS acTuAllY wOrKs?!”, but nobody actually comments if it works or not.
Hi I do not think it will work and I tried doing this before it just you natural hair so ye do not try this no point
It totally  doesn't work
I think this is not true because in the Philippines there are so many chemicals in rice and might damage our hair
Just applied to my hair I will update tomorrow
Yep me
How often should I apply?
Stress is the reason for my hairloss huh nevermind.
Has anyone ever tried this to see if it actually works
Do I have to do this process on daily basis and after applying this I need to wash my hair after how much time ? Please reply!
KEtni din tak rakha Sakta hn bna ke or week me let k din krna hai

GIRL ARIANA GRANDE PRAYZ FOR YIUR HAIR!!!
Kuch b Puri Briyani he bna do balon per 😂😂
Can you put conditioning instead of lavender
I’ve been using this for 2 days and there is no visible growth yet but I will keep updating
You have such a beautiful hair ♥ I will try this :) how long does it take to see some results?
Xxxxxxxxxxccccccc  1..... 1zZ1V B. .  1..
i dont recomend this method if your looking to have THICK long hair, as u can see her own hair and the other woman who use this remedy its very long but not healthy.This is because it shreds each strand to become thinner but longer hair.Dont risk having thin hair just for it to be a bit longer.Your hair will grow eventually.Eating iron tablets or foods that contain high iron levls will make ur hair healthier !!!!!!!11111!111!!!!!!
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! This is just what I needed so my hair that never grows can grow!
Stop showing off like literally 😅
Beautiful! Can it be done without heating/cooking the water?
IT ACTUALLY WORKS. Thanks
GUYS!!!! THIS TRICK WORKS!!!! My hair grew an inch after a week, ONE WEEK
ⓝⓞⓣ ⓡⓔⓐⓛⓛⓨ ⓖⓞⓞⓓ
hey can we use this after putting oil???
How much days will it take if j want to make your hair grow from the chest to the waist
Its not working for me😭😭😭😭
Already tried this?
I'm just gonna run hot water forget a boil
I will try it and in a week tell you if it worked or not( I hope it does)
Does it it work for people who have curly hair?
OH MY FREEKING MOTHER HOLY GRACANOLA GKCHLNV IT FREAKING WORKED WAHHH
I want to do this so bad but I'm afraid that my mom is gonna kill me 😭😭😭
How many days in a week??
I am going to try this hope it works
Shall we use shampoo for hair wash after applying these remedies...??? or a normal hair wash...??? anyone plzz  reply..??
Let me try this and c and I promise to slap whoever lied
Will this work for type 4c hair
I love to have have long hair but I don't know were the stuff is😭😭😭✴✴✴✴👄
Wish I had a hair like that :)
Just to let u know u can use uncooked rice water. Or cooked either way it works to grow hair
This is not true. Indian woman  have long hair since birth they never cut it. So they keep their  long hair all their life upto .. The feet. Another thing young people grow hair quickly. About an inch a week. Woman that has menopause we have a hard time growing our hair. But if u add biotin  oil,  coconut oil and vitamin e together and put it in a small bottle shake together. And add to scalp every 3 days into the scalp at night. Your hair won't have no split ends and it will grow.. And put your head upside down towards your stomach to let the blood flow in your head... Good luck
So finally I tried this today and it's no less than a miracle that my hairfall stopped. Happy with the results. Gonna apply this remedy everyday. 😊
Am an African girl from East Africa;Kenya to be specific, will rice water work on our type of hair(Afro kink hair?)..

What kind of rice do you use? Do you use yellow rice or white rice? And I am in America so is there a name brand that you would suggest?
If its too long im going to cut it at a *Long* hair not very long
I’m going to try this 👍🏽 Week one : small but noticeable results and shiny hair

Suggest better mild shampoo if we r using natural remedy the chemical free shampoo will be fine
Does it matter what kind of rice you use?
Where will i get tht oil. frm. Tho
Your hair doesn’t look healthy, just sayin
I’m trying like right now

This did work for me
this vid was posted on my birthday last year in 2018
All I did was, - Make the rice water thingy - take out rice - put rice water in microwave (bc Im not allowed to use the stove) - mix DONE (I don't think this made my hair longer in my recipe but it did make my hair healthier, thick, and it removed most of my split ends!)
Did not work for me
Are you serious......The day I’m not lazy to do this we don’t have RICE!!!.....
I want you to be my mom

When you get rid of your jerry curl perm you had all your life and just rinse your hair with rice water and go natural and watch it grow in a few weeks💆🏾‍♀️

Well that’s great for me considering I’m asian and all we ever eat is RICE 🍚 morning, lunch and dinner
After you put on the rice water and the 5 min have past, can you leave it in or do you have to wash it out? Also if you do have to wash it out, can you use shampoo after washing it out with water.
Can it be white rice
How Doug tie those buns

Someone please reply to me 🙏🏻 do I have to use it everyday and then wash my hair because I only wash my hair 3 times a week

Apparently egg n olive oil helps.... Shaved my head for charity and need a saviour to bring my hair back!  Haven't tried any remodys yet
It's actually used for a manageable hair. It works wonders and you don't have to detangle hair at all.
I did this and after like 5 days the water started smelling weird should I still use it I still have a lot of it :(
Ok im legit curious does this work my hair hasnt grown since like 2018 in January 😩 that’s most likely an exaggeration but i really wanna know if this works ok im just a lil kid dont lie to meeeee
Hey... You said to repeat every morning and night followed by washing it off after 20mins.....i need to wash my hair at night too? Twice in a day? And even if you say keep it overnight, it's gonna stink like hell and plus i guess it'll be really yewwwwww to have that thing on hair and try to sleep.....  If I decide to follow it, how often do I need to repeat in a week to get appreciable results?
Jojo siwa needs this XD
Any rice? Or what kind of rice
Thanks for telling me😘

Thank you soo much,May God reward you

But it has bad smell
Can I reuse the rice? I wanna try it but my mom will think its unsanitary, but I wanna try little bits at a time. So can I reuse the rice in new water?????
It works because rice water is proteïne, your hair gets a boost when you use it, and it starts to grow. But only if you have hair that lacks proteïne. So you have to test your hair first otherwise this will not work.
White rice?
Yeah I’m not even gonna try. This is one of those videos for straight hair **only**  since my hair is curly it only grows like a cm a year. So yeah that’s great.
You need at least eight inches cut off. Way damaged
my hair didn't make any differnce. And yes, i spelled differnce wrong, twice.
I did it and it works, but the texture is gross.
I am gonna try it

Always brush from the ends up! You’re pulling your ends I can’t watch 🙊

I'm not trying to be rude or anything but I think you should cut your ends. They look super dead and that can stop your hair from growing long like you want it to.
This is that girl from tangled 2.0
You could just take a shower for your hair in the rice water
I’m not try what if you lying and it could damage your hair and all your hair could fall off

A good remedy I use comprises of 4 ingredients and actually works!! Here they are:  Gel- For hair to stick and stay Hair Oil- Scent Vaseline Hair and Scalp Tonic- Sheen Rice Water- Growth  For healthier looking hair. I found this one day when my hair was dry and I was so tired of it so i started to use random things and things i saw on YouTube that claimed to work (like rice water). When I applied it to my dry and trashy hair, the immediate physical view was so outrageous! It filled me with joy and my hair was so healthy after few uses! I literally make this once in every week and apply 3 random days! It works! THIS IS MY OWN INVENTION!
but her hair is already long ho do we know it actually works

I've tried this... I just wondering the smell of the water... It doesn't smell nice to me 😅
Would it change the hair texture?
First of all, it is pointless to add oil, as oil just floats on the water.  Second of all. Isn't baking rice enough? You can eat rice and use that water huh?
Sumone is said dat neem oil is a scret of these chinese women
Yuk
Do you put rice water in your actual hair or on the scalp?
Can we used only rice water

Does anybody know if this would work for curly hair too?
My brother stress everyday

How to cook rice
That's cool for my hair 🎩🎩👒👑
Did u use any type of rice . Or just rice ?

Yes
You should have said that you are not an expert in the description so that the people who are trying this will not blame you for anything that will happen to their hair and their risking it for their self.
How long does it take with this method  to make your hair go to your ribs when you have a pixie cut?

“Effortlessly”?!?
Can you re-use rice you already used in water?
that hair needs a good trim
can it work on thearican hair
My hair was up to my ears now it’s at my hips omg
Idk why but it didn't work on me😭😭 and I leave it of 30 minutes
Well I caved and am commenting. I'm on day 3 of using the rice water. As of 3 days ago (Nov. 24, 2018) my hair measured at an average length of 20 cm. I will try to update every week or two if anybody is really interested.
I hope my hair doesn't fall off
Hi my ends Are damaged a lot and not like other peoples hair my hairdresser said to not put any water at and wet things on it or it will damage more should I do this trend and I reallyyyyyyy want Long hairr!?????
Why I'm I even watching this even tho I have long hair touching almost touching my butt :'D
When I was young my hair was like her's, but then my stupid little young self decided to cut it all off, all the way up to my ear.
is it just me or does the hair look the same
So weird
My guess is that the people who click on this video must want their hair to grow out that fast...
Hope this isn’t click can’t because I’m gonna try it
That's awesome do you have anymore ideas ??
Any particular rice? Jasmine? Brown wild? White sticky? Shrimp fried?
Your hair is dry. Why don't you trim the hair when it gets dry? Also, dying the hair dries out the hair. Also poor nutrition and poor hormone balance will inhibit proper hair growth. Just having long hair does NOT mean it's any good.
Whose looking through the comments to see if someone's mom is gonna beat they azz
P.S.  Please don’t cut like one of your replies said. Like they say “Hair don’t care....” Those who say cut it are only jealous of your beautiful hair....
I have been trying your remedy now for three days. My hair has become healthier hardly any tangles. My question is, do you only use the rice water only? Or wash with shampoo then use the rice water when hair is dry?
jharo ke jaise lag rahe hian
NICE!!!
"Using a cute little funnel" :-)
كبايه رز و2كبايه مياه كل شويه افتح واقلب بعدين احطو ع النار ماء فقط بدون الرز وادلج شعري لمده 5دقائق
Well thank you for your nice informative video , it is really nice watching a hair growth video done by someone that actually has hair and lots of it : ), i wish you all the best luck your very beautiful too.
I don't really need this why?  My hair is growing fast in 4 months it groß 11 inches  : D
We can wash our hair with shampoo or by simple water only?
It did not work
Your hair is already long so it's hard to tell if this is true
What kind of rice is recommended for this? Looks like brown rice in the video. I'm sure it makes a difference.
Is it brown rice
after using it ,after getting results, if we stop then do the hair fall again occur or no
Love the song
Her comving tjrough her hair effortlessly makes me jealous
I wnat longer hair key word linger my hair is a lil bit watet
WORKS I TRIED IT, AMAZING
I also use aloe vera fresh gel and lemon zest in this rice water.
*me sneaking in my room to go try this* I tried it... and it broke my expensive spray bottle... 🙄😑
do you rinse the rice water out after????
Can it work on tight curls?
Going to try this,  updates will be soon made.
My hair stays short because so it doesn't tangle
can you use microwave rice?
Okay so decided I'd try this because I didn't believe all the comments saying it grew a inch in a week or whatever. BUT I'VE BARELY BEEN DOING IT FOR THREE DAYS AND ITS GROWN A QUARTER OF AN INCH, THATS HOW A NORMAL PERSONS HAIR GROWS IN A MONTH! Also just so you guys know mixing rice flour into it works really well too, and it helps with acne! It makes your face really soft and it's gentle on your skin!
One question. Can this work with dreads?
Your ugly
for how many  days
dose it work yes or no😆
I just ate Spanish rice earlier
This does work!
Does it work with curly hair?
Wow thats awesome. I have in the front of my head thats lost hair due to pulling my hair back during my pregnancy with my son. Im going to try this..
And I thought my hair was long XD
Every people with long hair has ends like these so do I but apart from all the people talking about you're ends, I personally love your long hair! Keep up the good work !
Didi are you indian
*Asian People these days*
One does it matter if you have a different hair texture?and 2 does macaroni noodles work too
My hair is too my waist already but I always tell my friends I’ll get it to my knees and they don’t believe me soooo
I use it to wash my hair every day and the time that my mom cut it I was crying like ill person
What kind of rice
I chopped some bangs BY myself and of course i  messed it up so i hve to grow it back
Did it work? And i also think you should use it on your ends
how long are we sposed to soon like every day or once a week or once a month or once year I'm so confused

How did she put her hair in a bun without a hair tie or anything!!!?!?!!
Right now I am trying it and I am really confident of this remedy!! Im waiting to wash my hair rn.
Do you put it on the ends of your hair ???
should u put this rice water on before shampoo your hair or after shampoo and can u blow dry ur hair after rinsing ur hair with rice water
Why you boil rice water after 24 whats the importance of that.
Question 1.would this make my hair greasy because I have thick thick hair and I normally wash everyday because of teenage hormones would this affect it please answer I would really really like to know thank u💕
Half of your hair is dead.
me and my mom tried this before, didn't work for me though
heres a written version- put rice and water into a bowl mix to clean the rice.remove the water. add hot water, cover for 30 minutes then store in a container for 24 hours. remove the rice and bring the water to a boil, let cool and store
How many days do we do it ?
Plus can I steal your hair

ممكن ترجمه عربي بلييييز
Doe's it work
Can we put fragrance in the rice water just in case it smells bad 🤔🤔🤔
Can I use rice water on hair that's permed or I can't use rice water on permed hair ?
Reading response I believe the woman or girl referenced she grew almost 6 inches in hair growth in a week? Your hair averages maybe a 1/4 inch per month. Is she high?? Lol!
Could you by chance make enough rice water for daily treatment?  I don't have the time in a day to make rice water daily. Will it go bad if you make it in bulk?
It dose work
brown rice is compalsary?? should i use white rice instant brown rice??

*Eew...*
Who else is strolling down to see if it works
is it ok if i wash with shampoo after applying it for 20 minutes ?
Sorrry but is it a must to be a white rice???? 😄
I don't want it that long😁😁😁😁
I know how to get long hair- dont cut it
I was watching a video of Jess Hilarious when she was on the breakfast club and she told them she used rice water to thicken her hair and to grow it out
DONT DO THIS !  Rice water has arsenic in it which will HARM you and or kill you.
OMG THIS REALLY WORKS!!!! The water makes my hair really soft, shinny, and grow faster! I grinded the rise to use as a face mask like she said and it makes face smoother, whiter, and the scars from my acne started to fade away🙌
I'veve tried it a few times. It did in fact work FOR ME, BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT, do know that if you have protein sensitive hair, it WILL PROBABLY make your hair dusty, dry and brittle. You may have to change up the recipe or how often/much you use it. I only do this about once a month. Also, you can't soak your rice or store the water for TOO long. The water will get a weird smell. Personally,  the longest soak I've had and was able to use the water was overnight and the longest I've stored it was 24 hrs.
Question is anyone black that tryed this
Do you recommend a certain kind of rice?
Can u put coconut oil?
Mom: wat are u doing Me: trying  to make my hair grow Mom: stop wasting my shit *slaps* Me: cries sorry Mom:dont do it again Me:does. It 5 months later*

Could I use store bought white rice?
You have very sexy hair
Like add some on there then rub
Would this work for eyelashes as well?
Hair does not grow from your ears to your chest in just one week. Like other BS comments that claim it. It may grow a bit faster than your normal hair rate, but like everything else it will take time for your body to absorb and actually work the way it’s supposed to. But you people seriously need to think, Y’all will believe anything.
How much does the hair grow in one week? Pls answer me . I'm in a real fix .
I watched like 20 videos just to learn to grow my hair long
What type of rice should you use...

I was gonna tty it UNTIL it says u have to boil it and i don’t want to tell mi mom dat. cri
what was the thing she put on that spray bottle?
I am going to do it and hopefully update. Currently my hair is just below my chest and really weak so yeah lets do it.  Date: November 4th, 2018.  Edit: I didn't boil the water though, because wouldn't it take up the nutrients?  Nov 5th, 18: OH MY GOD guys, I just used it and my hairfall is gone. Like when I used to run my hand so much hair would fall out and now I am pulling at my hair and not even a single strand. Shooked. Wow.  Edit 2: and on the second day i managed to make the water smell really bad and so the whole house stinks and the now my mother wont let me.
It works
Hi. I have shoulder length bobbed hair that is fried from over coloring. I'll try this for 2 week to see if it works. I've tried the inversion method & that works. I want my hair bra strap length & healthy.  We will see.

So like, can you use any kind of rice for this or is it a specific kind of rice that works?
She said morning and night others said once a month or once a week Seriously whom should I believe CU's I really want to start this remedy
Your hair is so beauty.i wanna use rice water too💙

I started doing this in Thursday and I did it Friday and I’m bout to do it right now but I don’t think it’s going to work I see no improvement on my hair
Omg it actually works. Thanks so much
Even if it removes scars, I wouldn't use it to remove scars. My scars make me who I am.
how often do you have to put it？everytime when you wash your hair？
do you HAVE to cook the rice water ？and you dont have to make the oil in ，right？
Do you have to wait 24 hours???

I should probably try this.
Does this work?
waiting for 24hrs to end before boiling it and use it😊 so excited !
So it means we have to this remedy twice a day for 1 week..message for 5 minutes and after 20 minutes wash...Does that mean  we have to wash our hair also twice a day???.
is it correct.everybody suffering with hair fall.and trying to control.already they are sufferers .so i request all please don't cheat anyone
How many days it can use if once doing...I mean how many days that water can user..
You can also try getting more active and not dying your hair or put hair products or not as much to help grow your hair in months. I’ve never tried it but u can try I just I don’t rlly want to do anything my hair lol I want my hair back 😭
Not true. Its protein. Hair is made of protein. Eating a good amount of protein makes hair grow faster.
Ooo I’m fs gonna try this
Hi can you please tell me what kind of brush you use
Do i have to wash it after applying rice water?
Is it useful for men?
Hey everyone, I'm going to start this method from today, will keep you all updated. Probably will share pictures via Instagram if they grow or something because my hair never grows, literally never.
I really need it to work cuz my hair don't grow and they are not really natural if I use it then out a conditioner will there be a problem?
Thank you.
So cool!
who else really wants to do this but doesn't feel like it
How long will your hair grow and how long will it take
Nothing you put in your hair is going to make it grow faster/longer. Hair growth is mostly due to genetics. If any of these remedies works for you it is because you already have the genetics.  Masks and remedies can make your hair less likely to split and break which will help your hair grow long, but nothing will make your hair grow faster or longer than what your hair is programmed to do. This has been debunked many times.  Just eat healthy, drink water and treat your hair nicely and it will grow healthy. Simple as that.

Does the funnel HAVE to b cute?? Jk I tried this. My parents are Indian. They used to do this to me wen I was a child but stopped as I got older nd now my hair is long but vry vry thin smh always breaking. My dad told me to use the Basmati rice, castor oil, coconut oil or eggs, so I tried all of those either alone or in combinations nd I have seen the difference. After chemo my hair has changed a whole lot, some of it fell off nd it became vry thin but this rice water is really helping my hair to go back to being healthy...a lot of ppl tell me if I cut it, it will grow stronger but I cant cut my hair bcuz God gave it to me so I must treasure it however it is...

Okay I’m gonna try it lol  I have an update if anyone’s interested!  So I have used rice water on my hair and scalp for 8 days now, and I used it every single day. I left it a few hours before I washed my hair. So far I have seen about 1/2 inch of growth, and SO MICH LESS HAIR FALL! also this instant makes your hair softer and shinny as soon as you put it on and brush it thru.
Anyone know what brush that is?  Was hoping she'd have a link for the brush.
She’s sooo pretty
I love dis girl so much because she shows us how to put it on

I’m afraid the results won’t be as good with curly hair than with straight hair 😭

Give me 666 likes
If your sensitive to protein, I would only do this as a treatment (not frequently) or your hair will look like her ends
Hi. Why you boiled the fermented water.is this step optional? How often we can use it.
Wow amazing !

I just discovered your channel hun😭 what is the best remedy to stop hair loss and regrow it?
I always wonder... Do people with such long hair ever wear them loose when going let's say shopping or to school? If yes, then isn't it getting tangled and isn't it simply a bother? If no, then what's the matter of having this long hair if they're always in a bun or braided? Idk man I'm having existential crisis
Nice fake accent bob
Is there any other oil I can use
I love y’all so much 😁😜
I want to try this lemme ask my mom real quick brb
I'm so glad that I understand English
Thank you

Can I add coconut  oil instead  of Lavendar oil??
I have a pixie cut, (the kind were one side is longer than the other) how should I apply it?
Wow that's some lovely long hair , can't believe silly comments to cut it , why would you watch a video on growing long hair only to tell that person to cut it . Weird .Cutting hair doesn't make it grow it makes it shorter. Obviously. I don't want hair to my feet though  so cut it then maybe .
I use rice water here and there I think it does help strengthen the hair and adds a soft texture I just hate that it doesn't really last long before it starts to smell . But I make the rice water with rosemary
Your hair look soooo bad
Do this really work ??
This is how rapunzel born
can I store the remedy for more than 2 days? Or I have to prepare it every single day? My hair has been ~15 inches for 8yrs, I guess it grew a bit but I trimmed it couple times. I want to grow my hair to waistline but couldn’t. My cousin cut her hair to touch her shoulder and grew it back to almost waistline in 3 months during summer without using any remedy. I really want to have a long hair like her thou. Hope this one will work on my hair.
TODAY IS OCTOBER 05 AND I HAVE SHOULDER LENGHT HAIR, I WILL COME BACK NOVEMBER 05 TO SEE IF IS WORKING OR NOT, WISH ME GOOD LUCK!

This is such garbage your hair grows from the root of your head putting something on your hair will not make it grow this may make your hair look beautiful but it's not going to make it grow
Me:can I have the leftover rice Mom:why darling Me:nothing nevermind    Ps. I liked my own comment
Imma try this but my hair is thick though
*Rice Abuse.*
I'm gonna try this cause I really want my hair to be loooooooooooooooong
Thanku so much for this video
Does it really have to be organic? Because my mom doesn't have organic rice and I don't wanna ask her for it because she'll ask why..
beautiful hair I have ever seen
What kind of rice is that?
What is the bottle that put from it in the end
If you really wanna grow your hair, just leave it, trim it every few months and try not to use a lot of products. Brushing and braiding your hair helps too. All this extra products barely work it's usually just in the persons genes
Can I do it immediately after straitening...plss suggest me
I knew rice has some good side but did not know this. I am gonna do it. I will. Oh yes. I challenged my sister that I will grow my hair longer. Thanks alot
the ingredient is time
she needs to cut a big portion of her hair, and do a Coconut treatment..it will bring a gorgeous shine by getting rid of the dryness, anyway, everyone is different it all depends on your life style..stress is the number one ruin of our body, exercise, keep yourself hydrate, maintain a good diet by eating fruits, vegetables, and nuts..poultry and fish i strongly recommend..good luck to all..
Is it works?? How long will it works??
I was reading the comments and thought I had to say:  Everybodys hair is different. It takes a certain amount of time to show growth for everybodys hair. Hell I could probably do this and it only grows an inch or 5 inches in a week. Theres not really a point in asking other people how long it took to grow a certain amount of length because your hair could take a longer or shorter amount of time.
Will this work on black hair and work with the black hair routine?
U look like a witch
Dose the rice have to seet for 24h
do we really have to wait 24 hours???
Should we take a bath after it or just leave it
ur hair is life
Welp.. i just cut my hair..    WHYY
For how many days do I have to do this.
I’m going to try this, I’ll update in about 1 week or 5 days! 15 September 2018 Update 1: (5 days) it hasn’t grown so far...but I think I will have to wait a bit longer. But maybe it’s just my hair type?? Well we will wait until next update. Update 2: ye I think I was expecting it too soon, but I realised it’s quicker if u sleep in it and wash it in the morning, it’s a lot more quicker and it has grown using this method:)
💙💜💙

This is how the women of Huanglo village make the hair wash:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y45KMpCcBYU&index=2&list=LLYVnC5ScgHXg4KHZFkgmrEg&t=16s
Your explanation is totally wrong. you need to cook the rice first, then drain the water, cool it, ferment it one or two days then  strain it and use it. Wash your hair with it no need to use any soap or shampoo.  This will make the hair soft and silky. If your hair is falling this will stop the hair fall too. You must cook the rice or this will not work. You need to boil the rice in a big container with lots of water. Once the rice is cooked then strain the water and cool it. This cold, fermented rice water will make your hair soft, shiny, it will stop the hair fall and make it grow longer, thicker too.
*EXTENSION*
She don't need No more rice all that damn Hair she pass her goals💧

I'm going to try it today, my hair never, Never, NEVER GROWS. So if this works is a miracle of the gods. I'll keep you guys tuned: September 4, 2018.
I can’t wait to start!!
Can you use it in African American hair
Um can black people do this

If you wash your hair everyday, is it ok to use that everyday
Can u use brown rice
OMG I NEED TO TELL MY Friends   I NEEDED THIS SO BAD         Edit: (5 month later) OMG I just saw this lol
I ❤️your hair so much!!!!!!!
My #1 dream is to grow my hair to my feet. I need to try this right away! Edit- my hair is naturally super thick and tits grows outward like it is getting thicker instead of growing down getting longer
How good
I relize my hair don't break as much in a day anymore...i think it really makes it stronger
Is it really work?????

What kind of rice should i use
Omg ur hair is so gorgeous
Nice remedy. ...mere bal lambe ho gye😄😄
I know everyone is saying “oh! But her hair is damaged” I’ve tried this and my hair is bleached as well and I think the rice water makes your hair look more fried than it actually is, I recommend putting oil in your ends if your hair is bleached and then apply as she said in the video
Thank you for sharing!
do I really have to heat the rice water? Can I use other rice? I want my hair to grow 5 feet....
Yes the ends look unhealthy and looks very unhealthy
I’ve been doing this and it’s not working 😢
I'll wash my hair everyday also in the morning and the night!!!!
For those of you idiots who thinks it works over night, it doesn't.  There is no magic pill or potion. This will take time. It's not gonna happen in an hour, week, or month. You're not gonna go from a dude cut to tail bone. In a month you might go from dude cut, to Derek shepherd cut. It's not magic.
Plzz dont tell me this girls wants more longer hair then she already have
It won't rough my hair ryt ??
This strategy suits to my fluffy and thin hairs....?🤔🤔
Me: *looks down in comments to see if it worked* Comments I don’t see: omg this worked try it! Comments I do see: lol who else is here looking to see if it worked!
The ones that say her hair is damaged must be bald headed😂😂 nagging nancies. Her ends may be damaged but her hair is beautiful and i want

Nice Video. But These Foods are the main reason for hair loss and bald head. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSa3gtYvxck
Hello dear ssa ji nice video thanks for sharing. however, I wanna know I apply oil every weekend before I wash my hair if I'll do this remedy then I have to stop using oil which I don't want what if I apply oil after this remedy. Pls reply lots of love n respect ✊
I did this with white rice and it helped me alot i stopped for a little cause i didnt have time to do it but im continuing now😊
Okay guys, I've got an amazing plan to stimulate hair growth from this video and a few others:  1. Do get the rice water, it really helps your hair. 2. Add coconut oil to the rice water, but don't boil or microwave either of them as that would strip the nutrients.  3. Leave them in your hair for like 30 minutes before rinsing it out 4. Then go to bed and upside down massage you scalp (upside down helps more than just standing.) 5. Whenever you sleep braid your hair to minimize hair loss.  Please note you don't wash your hair everyday, and with the high nutrients going into your hair once (or twice if you prefer) a week is enough. Also, cover your hair when you shower as just getting them wet strips the nutrients.   Also for the massages, only do them every day for a week each month. More than a week and you might end up doing more harm to your hair then you are helping it.  Please comment in the comment section if this helped you and how soon you got the results.
*Guys this won't work if the funnel isn't cute nor small*

Omg i need to try this i have been trying to grow my hair out for so long thank you so much
Its cool how she puts her hair up in a bun
Your hair only grows at the root. You can add length(stretching)to existing hair by moisturizing. Which is what occurs here.  Your hair grows the same rate as your nails. Keeping your hair moisturized will keep hair length extended. If you notice,all women with the longest hair, live in a humid tropical environment.  Their hair always stays moisturized, and extended. It doesnt grow any faster than the rest of the population. The climate in which they live in makes it appear that way.
Do you have to boil it????
Waitwaitwaitwait you Cook the rice? Or nah
Do you do this before or after washing your hair?😊
Wooo imma try this and see what happens
Don't use honey
Hai,  how to coloring hair....

Does it work for curly hair🍛
Do you need first take a shower or before shower
She can keep it how long she wants
The one ingredient I thought it was going to be is extensions
I thought they say if you have too much long hair, you will stop growing😕😕😕 and she already have a long hair!!!!
I miss my long hair 😫😫
Does it have to be a special rice
Cutting your hair is not a solution because once it grows back, you will see the same length and damages again. I have long hair to the knees, but I don't use anything except mixed Mustard oil and castor oil. You need to use it from scalp to the tip of your hair but mostly focus on the scalp and the tips and massage for 10 minutes gently because these are the main parts to make healthy and get food or oil to get feed. Keep oil about 2 to 3 hours before washing your hair. Also, wash your hair daily, yet only use shampoo twice a week, but please use about 1and an half cup of water in your amount of shampoo you using for hair, (use mixed mustard oil and  castor oil the day you use the shampoo to wash it properly or you may use these oils daily as a second choice). If you use a lot different things for your hair, then you are just damaging your hair. Eat healthy and drink plenty of water. However it has to do with genetic too. (Hope its helpful for you all because simplicity is the beauty and health is wealth).. thanks..
Do I have to spray it everyday or after I shower?
or you could just use it like shampoo duh
Is it just plain white rice?
i swear when you tied up a part of your hair and sprayed the other because it was so thick i thought that was all of your hair
omg it worked my hair was up above my tummy now its up to my hips like no joke
And whats the next thing?

Want my opinion? The trick that will ALWAYS work will be...     Letting it grow! Duh
So.. I flat iron my hair at least once a week. Will this still be affective? I've tried so much but my hair hasn't grown much in 3 years. Edit: Didn't have essential oils and had to throw it away due to the smell. I'm aware its not bad/expired due to the smell.

its gust a rice & water??wow i'll try it..
which rice should I use? tactic, mamas or which
How many minutes should u stir it. Is it 1 hour or more
essantial oil is important in rice water
How often should I use this?
Do I have to make a new batch everyday? Or could I just use it and how long until I have to make more when it goes bad
I think your hair is damaged at the ends.....you definitely need a trim.....it will grow back very soon in a healthy way..... at least 10 inches trim is needed....
Beautiful
Her hair is already super long,so why does she use it without cutting her hair first?
Does it work for natural black hair
Does it matter what kind of rice I use?
Hope it works
I'm sorry but Imma Be honest this does not work because the fastest your hair can grow in a month is up to 7 inches but a normal human being grows one centimeter a month and I tried this for 5 months but it did not work
so easy ty for sharing this video!!!

Oh goodness your ends are so damaged. But the length is beautiful.Try applying some coconut oil on your ends or argan oil. It’ll help tremendously.

After shampoo do again we should wash with rice water or normal  water
I'm wondering how safe it is to use Rice water on your scalp seeing as though rice has higher levels of inorganic arsenic in it than other foods due to the way it absorbs it from our Earths crust as it grows?
can you soak your hair in the water??? do you have to put it into a spray bottle? 😐

WOAH

Wow, if I had really long hair like that I would cut some off and donate to people with no hair. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What type of rice is it????
To smoothen the the ends of your hair try drenching your tips with the hair conditioner you normally use, 1 hour before you wash your hair. Then wash the hair as usual (with conditioner after wash etc) and you'll see the diff in just one use. The conditioner conditions the hair like crazy. Just be sure not to use it directly on scalpe. Only on the ends (or damaged part). Hope you'll try and share with your audience. Love your Insta Page though. ♥️♥️♥️
I love your hair omg

What's ur hair clur?
Guys I'm sorry but I've done ton of research  on long hair growth and ..................  .      It's all about genes! This girl is Indian!!! Pffffff Indians are born with thick assssssss hair that grows looooong a.f. so yeah. Stop giving UR viewers false hope
This is my hair routine   I put a oil that my mum makes and it has a lot of other oils in them so I basically just put that all on my scalp and message it like you said and then I leave it on for 1 hour at least if not 1 hour then 30 minutes and I can't go lower then that  Then I have a shower and I put my shampoo and conditioner twice so shampoo one time and then wash it properly then against then wash it against then I put conditioner only on my hair and not my scalp because it's not good then I dot the same twice it makes my hair really smooth and silky and then I leave it in a towel for 20 minutes then I blow dry it with a hair dryer then I put some of my normal hair oil on the tips and that's it by the way I use Elvive shampoo and conditioner tell Me I'd it works or not for you it does for me and my hair has become so silky now and really long that it's now up to my bum and im only 12 and im really tall byeee

Asians are not growing much quicker than any other ethnicity the hair can grow from half an inch to 1 inch per month so regardless whether you use rice water or not you lot of very fortunate to grow such long hair at the speed especially if you know how to retain your length without breakage so rice water for you guys it's not really necessary but then it is still beneficial because it's healthy for your hair to mix it strong I here would not grow as fast as yours and I think the reason is is because you're stubborn oil go straight down to the ends as it keeps saying much moisture so here's naturally oily where's when you deal with someone's who's got afro hair the oil stops right from under the skin it doesn't even get down any of the ends of my hair so I he's always try and try your brakes very easy that that's the problem with us but I hear grass very long it can grow right down to the bottom of our feet it's just to retain it and that is to keep it moist constantly all the time subway I cannot keep her here moist because it doesn't go down I hear cuz it's curly

Instead of lavender oil we can use coconut oil
It works but is smells

Umm DNA IS THE ONLY INGREDIENT 🙄😒
Omg it worked 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 my hair is now so long 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
massaging your scalp will promote blood flow which in turn stimulates hair growth. eating healthy and thinking positively will lower stress with help with maintaining length.  But theirs no magic here its just common sense. Save your rice and water for dinner.

So did the rice water grow your hair? Is that how you achieved such great length? Or were you already born with long hair and the rice water just strengthened it
Can we store this water and if yes so tell the time too
