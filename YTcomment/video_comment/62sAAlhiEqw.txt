The link is in the description. copy and paste the link. look to your right and 'add to your cart' don't worry its free.
i just cant find the templates
wheres the link for the templates?
Thanks. Keep in mind they were for my students who are kids. you can always adjust the pattern to your liking. If you were to use fabric you would have a different result. It would be more full, more like casual bows you see today
But good job on them !
These aren't that good . I do not like the Ends.
Do you mean the supplies? you can get most of the supplies there :)
