Excellent curry,, so easy to make and it tasted sooo good.! Don't usually make curries as they turn out looking unappetising but this was so easy and quick to make.
Thanks a lot for the video I made this recipe for my lil sister she loved it n was asking for more I love to cook for her thanks for making my day
isn't the salt too much for just 2 cups of tomato??
Good one. But don't add too much of salt. And don't use the word 'try' always. It may reduce your subscriptions as well as your publications. In simple words, it's irritating.
Thank u yammi test
Try to turn off that ffffin piano
The voice is not understandable properly
I am cooked today that is looking very bad

Pakka engineer :D "integrated", "be in contact", "inserted", "completion" Hehe cute! Keep up the good work and your signature style. The detailed description was extremely helpful to me as a beginner.
Oh my god I can't thank you enough!! I've just started cooking, and there have been disasters to say the least. This is the first curry I tried. It has come out so kickass that people over here are surprised :DThank youuuuu... Yummyyyyy

I am a Bengali and I like South Indian food. Bengali people don't like the sourness of south Indian Food. But it is the tanginess of south Indian food that I particularly like. Once I had no vegetables at my house and came across this recipie and prepared it as a evening snack. It turned out delicious!
Try to okay😏

Hey Jerks and "English Nazis" out there. Just STFU!!!! This is a cooking channel and frikkin get that into ur brains. Ure able to understand what he is trying to convey and that is more than enough. Few of u who are trying give him ur damn piece of advice, dont even know ABCs of cooking and here to learn( I raise my hand). Do that. His vocab aint necessary as this receipe isnt for really english ppl. So nobody need ur dumb advice an focus on cooking. Bye
sufficient?try to:ufff...vry boring....explain in ur mother tongue yar.....
nice
Thank you!   Very good :)!
In between the curry add salt?! Are u serious 😂😂😂 try to try to... And curry has come in nice shape. Wat the heck he must be a newbie from some startup!
Nice recipe. Is it okay if I peel the tomato ? Because i heard that the tomato skin is not easily digestible or indigestible.
it's nice
Thank you so very much for making a video on this recipe !! I tried it and loved it.

are you an engineering student?
my fev recipe with jeera rice
nyc yummi
what is the quantity of tomato
Hey..There's a simple way to make a tomato curry where i saw in a blog. I just loved it as so much and its so quict and easy.   https://klearners.blogspot.com/2016/09/how-to-make-tomato-curry-for-pure-and.html
Baba dont use rice scoop for stirring in the pan na :(
How much chilli powder?
Its a simple chilly curry.
thats a lot of oil.
nice video
curry name shud b - TRY TO xD haha
your dish spoon will get melted in the hot oil. why don't you use a wooden or steel spoon?
What kind of Shape you imagine when you prepare the dish? is it Round Shape? oval? rectangular?  can you mention please?
hilarious narration (wait till it turns to brown color but not black color)but nicely done (y)
ok ok ok ok.....
try to do it properly try to stir properly try to mix it properly try to do this way properly...what the fuck lol why are you like trying to treat us like we are stupid and thick? like ur nagging at a kid who keeps doing something wrong. Why would anybody NOT do it properly? you sir, try to pronounce english words PROPERLY :-)
All that chilli then you added loads of red chilli powder? are you trying kill somebody? lol and this curry is not really a curry is it? more like the base soup for a potato curry where u could ass peas and paneer... or simply take the tomato sauce and perhaps use it as a sauce for boiled rice....i have never heard of eating that on its own. Sounds like a poor man's curry. That and rot.
oh and pls dnt say sufficient .. tell us as per 2 cups of tomatoes how much salt ..or any other spice u think is needed. .. sufficient is vague  :)
arey sir.... u forgot dhaniya and zeera powder and dnt add ginger garlic paste but inatead just add garlic paste .. and loose the onioins.. thats the chatni.. now if u want to make salan then all is well but no cumin or mustard seeds needed. i am.frm hyd ...thats how we cook the 2 different recipes. but keep up the good work.
I tried this today and it turned out great. Thank you
Poor accent...what is comin' seeds...its cumin (as in 'cue-min') and describe which spoon you are talking about...its tsp or tbsp?
😋😋tasty
you use lot of oil and chille powder. try to reduce
awesome video man,,, thought it would be boring but looks cool,,,, explained very well
ok :-D
Try to avoid "Try to"!
nice
LOL @ people learning how to make a curry by watching your video and getting annoyed at your suggestions, which is presumably why they watch the video in the first place... what?!?!  Looks deliciouis, Rushi, thanks for sharing with us!
