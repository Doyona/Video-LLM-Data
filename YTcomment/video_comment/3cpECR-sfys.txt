God, you're annoying.
I got some for my 35ft camper, propane be expensive.
Just got one.  Set it on eco mode and at 65 in our sun room.  On night mode so hopeful that it keeps it regulated.
I’m looking for a heater that is safe to be left running in a 20’ rv during the winter while I am at work, would this be safe or is there a better option?
Best heater ever. Over 3 years so far!
What is the background music called?
Any thoughts on how this may work in a smaller bedroom(150sq ft)?
Thanks for the info and your funny
Will this help lower my electric bill in a trailer 14x80
Thank you.  A good fair review. 👌
Dr heater is not helping at all. I might die tonight because I believed this review
I bought the less expensive model of this heater (968) they have on Amazon (currently +/-$92) - same heater, it just doesn't have the wood cabinet. I have a 700 sq ft. condo and only have electricity for heat. My last heater gave up the ghost at the end of last winter, so I picked one of these up. I'm amazed at how well it works. I swear it makes it feel like you have a wood stove or fireplace in your room...
My mother is staying full time this winter in our camper at our house. Im looking into getting one of these to help heat it. I live in oklahoma and at times we know we will be using propane but wanting to know if ya run your as main heat source. Like for extended time. We are new to rv life and im little worried with the 1500w draw on the outlet
I catch Kermit The Frog in the review...here and there. Good review.
Don't believe this guy it is not better than others despite the manufacturer also making this claim. All room heaters are 1500 watts this is the max that any heater can put out. all those is heater might be a little bit safer and better constructed it actually pumps out no more heat than a $20 heater . This heater is definitely not worth the money I would not suggest that you buy it. Do your research. Shop smart!
SO, Dr. Infrared Heater teamed up with this old school duck!
This vid really reminds me of RegularCarReviews on youtube
I know this is an old video but can anyone hot this gets to touch in the back or anywhere on the 1500 watt setting?
Awesome and funny review, I enjoyed it lol.
In spite of so many good reviews here on YouTube , Mine lasted One year .. Upon taking it apart to diagnose the issue , I discovered a white wire and a connection had burned to a crisp ... Even though it burned it never smelled and gave me no indication of a problem, except the Heater tube went out ...thus No Heat .. I threw it away and would never purchase again ..
would you like to do a review on the Phoenix 1500? https://www.amazon.com/Heat-Storm-HS-1500-PHX-WIFI-Infrared-Heater/dp/B07JXRWJ8D/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=heat+storm+heater&qid=1575932721&s=home-garden&sr=1-6
Thanks for reviewing.  But what's with the heater on a dock?  :-P
This is the best Review I've seen in years. Thank you.
Does it make noise when it's on? Is there a fan in it?
Does it dry out the air as much like other heaters do?
This unit failed within a year. Do not buy.
Is this a heater review or RV sales film?
Good video ! Can it be placed on a Carpet ?
hahaha that may be one of the better videos ive seen not even about the review your just a funny dude lol keep it up funny man haha
*Ordered one it >>>**ur2.pl/945**  worked so well as opposed to waiting for the wall board heaters to warm the room we ordered another for our guest area in the basement. It is light weight and can be moved from room to room with little effort.*
Dude yes. I'm looking for one to use in my RV aswell!
*Great heater,>>>  **https://t.co/8KaBq6vCT0**  using it in my 5th wheel, it's below freezing and it's doing real good, furnace hardly comes on. I'd buy it again.*
36 foot w two slides 12 and 6 foot
I Got This Heater 6 Years Ago And Until yesterday best little heater I've owned, yesterday the power switch went out so ordering a new one $5.00 bucks repair and utube video and will be back in busine
my husband bought this heater it stopped working after one month and they sent him something to fix it which he could not figure out and ended up cutting himself twice after spending hours on it. this heater sucks and the company is the worst . they make you pay for shipping to fix this defective product or make you fix it yourself .total rip off!
This is not only an informative review, it's HILARIOUS and enjoyable to watch to boot! Well done and thank you!
Just got one of these. Its been pretty amazing so far. Great review!
Yo your back!!!
5:25 - I notice you're using the SLR GorillaPod—you should check out the GorillaPod Focus; it's much sturdier! ;)
review the RV!
