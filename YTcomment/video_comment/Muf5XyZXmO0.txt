In which stores can you get good quality whip cream. I have been looking for long time here in India but I can't find any. Maby it looks different then in Europe? I could only find packets of cream which were kept outside cooling area. Is that it? Cu's it looked like cream for coffee or something.

please help i was tried for egg less chocolate cake but the batter is overflow and all the batter came out from baking tin. Why ?please help.
and i wanna ask you whether a normal cooker can be used. and if yes how to use it. the one shown in the video is an idli cooker right? ?
its better to freeze the cake for skme time before you go for cutting and slicing it . that helps in not breaking the slices and also assures neatness. Plus i dont think that augar syrup is necessary .But anyway good job.
the cake is a lie

Looks yummmy..you can avoid the crumbs by making a crumb coat first (by using a light layer of cream), put it in the fridge or freezer and then cover it in whipping cream or by putting the cake in the fridge or freezer before decorating. Just a tip:)
Where did you get this whipping cream? I don't want to go through the burden of converting the Amul cream.

Hi ... you are using condensed milk in every eggless cake recipie . Does it taste same everytime ? Is ther any other option to bind the cake?
Wow its really good!! but i had one doubt, i have heard that you need to add something acidic in cake to make it react with baking soad so that your cake can become fluffy.. so is it true and if it is why didn't you add anything acidic? can we make it without adding something acidic too?
Looks Yummy :p  I'll try it and I'm sure that it will be tasty when I make it. Thank You very much for giving me such an idea

Hey I tried this cake! Although the cake came out very well in terms of taste, color and texture but the cake was very dense. Not as light looking as yours! Any idea what could have gone wrong? Thanks :)

Osome man!!!   m gonna  try this in  my home :)  i really loved it  :)
I came here after reading about you in Indian Express. You are doing a great job!  The most important thing I feel is the way you were able to salvage the broken layer of the cake with uber confidence. I think that is a hallmark of a good chef :-) Good luck !
Lovely..I used to make such cakes long bak..phir woh din yadd a gayye

Excellent recipe Sir! You mentioned Maida to be one cup and condensed milk to be half cup. May I know the exact measurement, like how many grams or ml !?  And I tried your butterscotch ice cream and it turned out to be amazing . Kudos to you !
can i use a rice cooker in baking the cake?
Sorry to say but very tacky.... although the idea of baking without oven got me watching. .. it was not a pleasant view. You need to see n learn from other senior veterans who do this so professionally. ...
Awesome! thanks :D

I am having a hard time cutting the cake too :( I always fail
CAN WE BAKE IT IN MICROWAVE
To decorate the cake I purchased whipped cream from the store and kept it in the fridge for a while. But when I put the cream on the cake, it started melting and thus I couldn't decorate it at all. What can I do to prevent it from melting? I tried to decorate the cake in a room temperature.
Wow amazing...gonna try it
where can i buy the pot used? whats that called?
wow, it really working........
instead of blender can we use mixer grinder blender
thank you very much for this video
+shine gomez Have a look here: http://cookingshooking.in/black-forest-cake/

I've made hundreds of these cakes ans you are the first one who actually does it how it should be done. In my country we call these 'Schwartzwälder kirsch'.
Good day! Mr. Baker, does it taste really good rather than if it has eggs?
Hmmm.. what was the ingredients again?..Cant understand sorry.
Hmmm.. what was the ingredients again?..Cant understand sorry.
+Abdurrahman Shamim Yes, I am :)
hmre pas jo cooker hai woh normally hai wistle wale toh base mein pani b rakhna hai kya?
Are. Are u adding whipped cream
*****, You can try! I cant confirm the outcome. Try in maybe for 5 mins in med power. If not cooked give it another minute.  If you have a convection setting, preheat it for 10 mins in 180 and bake for 25-30 mins in 180 C :) In convection setting, it'll bake really well!
wow u did it well lad :) good going
Hi dear, this really looks very nice.
Hi dear, this really looks very nice.

Looks delicious!  I actually tried this cake today in my electric cooker. It has a program for 'cake' which is about thirty minutes. I programmed it. But it actually took more than thirty minutes which left the cake hard in bottom. And I felt the cake was not risen well. It looked very thin. What could be the reason?  I dint put salt under the vessel since it was electric cooker.  Was it because of that? What according to you is wrong? Please revert back and I definitely want to try this until I become a pro in making cakes!! Thanks a ton! :)
nice
can we use simple dairy milk instead of condensed milk?

Hi..just tried your recipes..all come out soft and moist!i did have problem before when make my cake.It was too hard and not spongy enough.Wiith your recipe i  have solved my problem!;DYour recipe iis just awesome:)
Thanks Selin :)  You can check out our channel, We have a few recipes in our series Eggless Baking without Oven, Like Pineapple Cake, Pumpkin Cake, Cookies :)
it's not wrong.. it's a "correct variation".. it is not necessary that a dish must be prepared the "exact same way".. so be mindful before commenting... it is about tasty food and not about the "correct way" of preparing it..
The way a dish is prepared is different everywhere. This is the way the pastry chefs make here, and we get this Black Forest Cake or White Forest if we look in bakeries here.   The ingredients such as kirsch and stuff are not easily available in India, thats the reason behind making like this.   Everyone has a different view for looking at different things.   Thanks, Yaman
All these videos on how to make Black Forest Cake/Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte and you're all getting it wrong. It's like putting garam masala in an Italian dish. Just wrong!!!
:)
hands down!!! the best black forest recipe I have ever watched..everything was simply the best .. however, it would have been better if you could show us a piece by cutting the cake..thanks for the recipe I am going to try it ..
I used powdered sugar.. You can use any icing/confectionery's sugar or powdered :)
Did you use icing sugar for the cake?.
Hie, You dont need﻿ to bake again.. Just bake the cake batter, then apply the cream and other stuff.. Enjoy!
That smell and taste is related to the maida afaik.. It might be adulterated.. Try making the momos again using maida which is of some other brand/shop..
:)  Have you checked out my Gulab Jamun recipe? If not check it now now! You'll love them! :)
:)  Have you checked out my Momos recipe? If not check it now now! You'll love them! :)
The moment when I saw him I was like he's adorable! :) and thank you for the video! :)
Excellent, is the only word I have for this yummy and my all time favourite Black Forest Cake....You made it so well and explained even better.
:)  Have you checked out our Rasgulla Recipe? Check it out now!!!
excellent and thank you !
can i use whipping cream after finishing the cake we should bake again in oven or only one time
What happened to your momos? Let us know!
For soaking the sponge? Yes you can!
can i use orange juice to go with it
i will ;)
:)  Do let us know the outcome :)
thank you!!! thanks for being so nice.. i'm very much excited to do this!!! for my husbands birthday!!! :)
Jennie, Many people dont have the digital weighing scale, thats the reason i used cups..  1/4 cup butter = 57 gms. You can use about 65 gms!   Use normal all purpose flour/plain flour!
im having problem measuring butter in cups,, can you use grams instead of cup? and what kind of flour should i use?
a big thanks !!! god bless :)
10 mins should be fine :)
one more question,, how long will i need to pre heat convection oven? thank you!!!! :)
Great! Luking frwd 2 it!
You mean how will you take out after baking? Grease it well and line with butter paper till the height of the pan. And after its baked, lift it up!
how will i tranfer the cake into a box wthout destroying it,,
thank you'
Thanks..  I'll make cookies and macaroons and upload soon :)
I have never tried baking in rice cooker. You can try! But i am not sure about the outcome!
You can bake at 180C or 350F for 30 mins.
or can i even used a normal rice cooker?
hi can i cook it using convection oven? how long will it took ?
Wow! D cake luks really awesm! M gonna try dis recipe.  If possible can u do a tutorial on making cookies widout an oven.  Also, is it possible to make macaroons widout an oven? If yes den pls try doing a tutorial on dat 1 too:) Thanks
Yes, we can steam the cake too.. I do have a video upon it.. But the taste n texture is a bit different..  Send your cake's photo to me at cookingshooking@gmail.com or yaman@cookingshooking,in :)
I had tried it with water inside of salt it came out good too
Taste is what matters :)   Send your cake's pics to me.. :)
I MADE ONE OF THIS! AND IT TASTE GOOD. but it doesnt look well. i made some mistakes on it bt still its creamy and delicious
Tanq.....:)
Will try to make them soon :)
Normal sweetness will do....and i want to see butter american and swiss all three....:)
Hie,  There are so many types of butter, american, swiss and more.. Any particular? How would you like it? Too sweet? Or normal.. Just asking ur opinion!
Yes i would like to see a butter cream icing process and also the icing that you used in ur black forest cake here
thank u :)
Hie,  Complete text recipe is in my website. cookingshooking.in Search for Black Forest Cake in search box.
hiii ... can u list out the ingredients.... what we use in this to make black forest cake...
Aashika, Taste is what matters :) I am happy that they loved it :)  I would love to see the picture, send me at yaman@cookingshooking.in or cookingshooking@gmail.com   7th post from top is the list. :) Also, the link for the post is in the video description!  Thanks, and waiting for your cake's pic!
Okay. :/ Yeah, my cake turned out to be very welll it came out a littlee hard, but it was good still. . People loved it. Thank youu veryy muchh! I only wish i could post a picture to you of it.  And, yeah, i surfed through your site, i found many other recipes but i didn't find the list of stores. Soo..
Sure :)
Aashika,   Amul cream is a lowfat dairy cream. Which does not gets whipped easily. For cakes, amul cream cannot be used! :/ Sorry. You'll need to get whipping cream from a baking supply store. List for stores across India is in my website :)  Have you made the sponge? And all the other things are made?
Yess. It is whipping cream. Amul's whipping cream.
I do have a plan for them! :)
Could you show some cookies. I too don't have an oven
No it is supposed to be like liquid. But as we start mixing it, the fat molecules in cream take the air. And the volume increases, hence it stiffens up! :)
Hie Jenie,  Any particular, you want? Like butter cream?
Aashika, which cream are you using? Is it whipping cream?
Hi. How do you whip the cream? i kept on whipping for about 15-20 mins, but it still doesn't get like yours. What do i do?
did u mix the cream with water or something to prepare cream because it is initially in liquid state ...
Please upload a video of icing preparation also....:)

Ok.. Hard and it was not cooked.. Basically, the temperature was too high inside the cooker. Always, always make sure the flame is very low..   You can trim off the burnt portion/hard portion. And then make something like cake pops or truffle! :)
Yar it doesnot cook properly it became too hard and a bad taste. Occur it totally mess help me pleze
What happened let me know! So that i can tell you where you were wrong!
I try thish cake but it become worst
Salt helps in creating the hot oven like ambiance inside the cooker. Substitute: Sand  Condensed milk is the best substitute for Eggs in a cake. I would not suggest anything else. But common substitutes are flax seeds and reactions(baking soda+lemon/vinegar) and stuff!  Do check out my giveaway :)

I am glad you made it and it came out good!  It becomes dry from sides due to either higher temp or due to over baking. Next time bake it in little less flame or loosen the cooker whistle even more.   You can check the stores list where you can get cream in India in my blog.
