I'm glad I found these channel.Because 2 of my classmate stole my pencil case.And my things.
My daughter and I made this--so cute! She picked the fabric scrap, zipper and size. And I used the hot glue gun, which was super fast. It has held up well too. My only recommendation is to make sure you use a sturdy fabric like she uses so it's not super flimsy. Thanks again, Sea Lemon!
it looks  readymade 👍👌👌
good
Cool
Can we make this with felt too?
l like pouch school kili😁☺😀😀🏤🏢🏤🏢👝🎒👝🎒👝

Seems like it would've been ideal to zip, tape over the zipper, then unzip? Not sure if that'd work as well, though, not having tried it....

Just found your channel today and I had to tell you I love it already! The videos I have watched have been very well done and your crafts look creative and neat :)
Hey, I absolutely love your channel and I was wondering if you could do something like a photo book where you could put Polaroid or other type of photos in
Where do you buy you're vinyl? I live in the Netherlands and it's like we only have vinyl floors....
can u make a video for a tab flip cover
You really need a sewing machine.  Nice job on the hand sewing.
You deserve way more subscribers...

Hi Jennifer! Can you show how to make a pencil case with height? Like cuboid shaped pencil case.
I've seen a similar video using cloth. That one way you can use a machine or glue. I know you said you don't like the glue method but the glue you van use is called aleene's original tacky glue.
esta bonito solo,q nose ingles😍😍
so.....
Wow, I'm so sad because I just bought a new pencil case which is a mistake :( Now I desperately want to make this one! Anyways, would you mind to do a DIY for durable tab dividers? I have cardstock but lack ideas on how to spike them up.
Aimee McRandle you're so dumb
can also use as a makeup bag or a girls menstrual bag with essentules in :) just use a liner of waterproof fabric or use a fabric shower curtain
hey sea lemon can i tell you something.you're course is multimedia arts
Amazing!
Amazing!
Sea lemon, if I want to place more pens inside, how do I make it bigger? As in the pencil box you made is more flat but what if I want to make it more puffy? (Sorry for the bad English)
that's awesome! i'll love to make one someday :~)
Hello ! " How to make a gift BFF " ? Please, I want to surprise BFF! 😍😍😘 I'am from Bosniaa!😉☺
Last year, in my textiles class, I used some orange and blue retro material from my mum's old bag to make a pencil case. I still use it and it looks awesome!
This is amazing...I folowed your (super simple) instructions and my pencil case turned out beautifully!!!
I loveee your channel
Just recycled my old sweatshirt. You saved me from paying at least ten Euros for a new freakin pencil case this year. And no one could even tell that I made it myself:D Thanks for this DIY!:>

Amazing :)
wow this is great!
This is cute! :) I think I'll try a center zipper the next time I sew a pencil bag. I have a zillion markers and other arty supplies so pencil bags keep them somewhat corralled. LOL
Thanks for awesome DIY!!!!!!!
I'm watching this video so attentively as if I'm ever gonna make it myself.
I looooove this DIY, thank you so much! :)

I've been meaning to make a pencil case for ages but I was kind of intimidated by zippers, to be honest. Seeing you sew this super cute one by hand showed me that there's nothing to worry about! Thanks for making this, Jennifer!
OMG! I guess I can make cases for all of my pen and pencils! Thx a lot! I really love it!
