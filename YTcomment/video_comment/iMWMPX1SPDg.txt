try cooking Dal with full cream milk, once my friend made Dal with milk taste out of this world. I forgot how to cook rice and Dal since my mom stepped  into kichen. only item I cook is egg that only if my mom is deep in sleep. I love my mom cooking. I love her Biriani. She doesn't  put much oil. My sister and my dad also good Cook. My dad's nehari  and paya  is out of the world  even though  he doesn't  put any spicy spice but still taste. My dad will do it for me because  I can't eat nehari  and paya from desi store so dad will cook for me. I am blessed  to have  such a great  parents, Alhumdulliah.
