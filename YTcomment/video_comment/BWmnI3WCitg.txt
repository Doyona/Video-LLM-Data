Do you serve this hot out of the oven?
You sure she doesn’t mean 5 lbs of potatoes? I tried 2 lb and not nearly enough. Doubled butter seasonings cheese and bacon🤷🏻‍♀️
Jesus Yt people.. there is more seasoning besides salt & pepper
I, too, am a pepper lover.  These look delicious, btw!  :)
Why would somebody have made those without potatoes duh
Your cheesy bacon ranch potatoes came out so delicious/ I doubled the recipe😊  Thanks Laura ❤
Couldn’t we just sprinkle a package of dry ranch dressing instead
Gonna add broccoli to this!
This is delicious.  Everyone loved it
Made this last night. My wife, son and his girlfriend practically licked the baking dish clean. They liked it so much I am making a variation with roasted chicken pieces in the mix.
7years later and it still is a winner! Dinner turned out great with this!
Omg looks amazing and delicious.  Can't wait to try. ❤❤😮
Making this right now although my husband doesn't want the ranch dressing so everything is in except the ranch dressing. Can't wait to eat 🤤🤤

I cooked it for dinner...it was awesome! Thank you for the recipe
Can you sub the Ranch with sour cream?
Thank you I just made this and it is excellent.  I did not have bacon so I put in bacon bits and it is still very good. ;-)
What temperature in the oven
What can I use instead of ranch ?
I made this tonight it came out great!  My oven is not working, so I microwaved potatoes, then used the air fryer to melt cheese.
Forgot the chicken
I’ve mad this using tater tots
I made this with some cubed rotisserie chicken added. Good stuff.

Does every recipe these days need to have something green🫑 or red🌶️ in them? 🥴 Can't do spicy or acidic due to medical reasons.
My mistake was watching this video at 9am.  It is "MOUTH WATERING" for goodness sake.  I'm like you, I LOOOVE Ranch dressing on potatoes any way I make 'em.  Thanks loads for sharing your DEEE-LICIOUS recipes with us.  I've learned so much on your channel Laura.  😁😁
could you use turkey bacon in this recipe?
Made this again today I made my own ranch and yes this is taste very good .
Just curious. What can you eat this with?
what is ranch dressing? never heard of it
You should have added minced garlic and some caramelized onions!!! that would have made it much much better!
You can use tater tots too 🙂
I'm getting ready to make this because all we have in the house are potatoes and sausages lol
I made your chicken parmesan.  3xs and last night it was Awsome😊😊♥️🇨🇦🇨🇦
I LOVE YOUR RECIPE ‼️MY DAUGHTER ‘s ❤️THE MOST REQUESTED OVER LOADED BAKED POTATO!!! Thanks Laura💕💞we love it 😊 😍 !!!
If you all haven't seen a documentary called.... It's worse than you think..... By revelations of Jesus Christ ministries..... I suggest you watch it... All praise and glory to the most high Jesus Christ
I eat very simple and very plain foods now, but I still love to learn to make fancy delicious foods to serve other peoples🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Oven temp?
I was hungry so I did it in microwave way it still turned out good
Juicy
Good grief lady! Lay the he'll off the caffine!

Loveeeeee this recipe so easy and delicious!
No this is bs!
That looks so good I want to eat it right now
Laura, I made this dish for dinner today and my family loved it. They ate the whole dish. Thank you for sharing your delicious recipes 😊
How many potatoes did you use for this? I want to make this!!!
I'm British, what is Ranch Dressing?
🎊 delicioso 😋
Looks so yummy,
What is the white sauce she added?
What is ranch sauce? I’m from Australia,I love to know what it is 👍👍👍🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿
Too hot for the oven, so I made this one in the crockpot.  Super good!!
Greek plain yogurt
Hi laura can I used Greek yogurt instead of ranch dressing
Does it have to be unsalted butter ? I only have regular salted I think 😏
Bacon is NOT optional!
Always blow on your potato.
https://youtu.be/B_DDkFSvx78
We tried this and it's a Big hit my family loves this.
Looks so delicious
Too much talk
I make this, but I put the potatoes in a gallon bag, dump in dry ranch mix and oil, shake to coat. Put them in a pan, roast, then top top them with whatever we like. So much easier, and the flavor really gets into the potato.
You remind me of my sister who raised me and three brothers and a sister when my parents died in an accident in the Himalayas in mountaineering expedition for national geographic. She made this all the time.
Yum
Making these potatoes for dinner. Yum!
Good girl!
Looks good ,I'd say you could use sour cream instead of ranch dressing .👍
We are all crazy about potatoes in my country and this your recipe is just wonderful! Just one question - we don’t have here ranch sauce, what is the closest substitute to it?
Thank you Laura!   I tried it and it taste soo good.
This looks lovely thankyou x
Do u boil the potatoes before putting them in oven
Made these for dinner and my dad absolutely loved them.
Is there any reason why you waited until the potatoes were out of the oven to put on the green onions?  Rather than putting them on with the cheese, ranch and bacon? Thanks
Hello, I want to know if you know your own recipe  Ranch Dressing?
Enjoy ur video
Look delicious❤❤
Wow! U cook delicious
Anyone else find the potatoes stick to the pan ?  But omg  yummy !
It would be good served with a little sour cream drizzled on top!
I tried this recipe but I but did half sour cream and half ranch
Looks really good
❤️Potato anything

New sub!  I'm enjoying you create this meal. I just made it & it was so scrumptious❤️

Cooked bacon in the fridge? Is that like leftover wine?
Me and my son love this recipe thanks

I just came across your video and made it .. It was a hit with my family, thank you !
E
I made this and oh my, so delicious!
Quarantine recipe????? Yes ma’am I think so
I'm left here wondering how she managed to cook that bacon in the fridge?
Pity I can't understand what she says           also doesn't tell us the temperature  of the oven
I make this after I’m baked 🤷🏻‍♂️
Can you believe my precious Fam asked “where’s the cheese?”.. so I added 2 more cups & put back in the oven, delish 😘
Hows the Situation there mam plzz tske care of u and ur around...Allah bless all in shaa Allah
I reckon if you added cooked chicken with the potatoes and used BBQ sauce instead of ranch you would have a one dish Hunter's Chicken dish there.
Could you substitute blue cheese dressing for ranch dressing?
Thank u very much. Just made this. Is It Great. Thank U.
Tried it and the recipe was well received.  Since ranch dressing is usually too salty for my taste, I left out any additional salt.  Didn't have any bacon so used chopped ham bits.  Thinking of adding more onions next time.  Thanks
What was the temp of oven for an hour ?
Looks scrumptious! Love all the ingredients and your combination is excellent.
I'm srry nice video,  however have you ever thought of wooden spoons?
HI GUYS!!!
An unsalted potato is an evil potato!
Looks yummy
sort out the typography on the intro shots, the Kit   chen looks like 2 words, tighten it up
Those looks so delicious😋
ALWAYS WASH HANDS BEFORE BEGINNING ANY MEAL.
Wow this recipe has me watering at the mouth. Its gunna be a new option in the Duggan Irish household .
vey nice and very good but do not like that you do not sais the amoung of ingrediant that you put  in ty vm
Yummy
One very very key point she forgot to make is to start with already cooked (boiled) potatoes.  I listened 3x and never heard her say the cut up potatoes are already cooked before she seasoned and baked them.
??? You never mentioned the temperature of the oven.
I made this for my family last night and the absolutely loved it.
What oven temp?
Can I use ceasar instead of ranch? Does it have to be ranch?
The flavors MELD?😂
word 2 the wise: let the hair down... rating$ r everything...
"Ten Dash Foe!" on the ranch dressing. Ya hear me!?
I LOVE THIS .SO GOOD
Yummy
Your re ipes are yummy, so easy to make,  thankyou so much!!! It's a big help to me.  I go on youtube watch your videos get an idea and I get dinner for my family. Thankyou again!!
Making this right now 👌😊
I would love to know where you got that glass baking dish with the handles. You potatoes look scrumptious.
Yummy:)
New subscriber from Australia,  brilliant videos, thanks so much😀💕
If I am roasting a chicken on a lower heat, can I put these potatoes in at the same time? how would I adapt?
Laura thank you for your cheesy, bacon, ranch potatoes. They'll looks so delicious. I'm going to make them for the family.
Mmm! Trying this for the next potluck!
It's really good
I'm definitely trying this.... I love doing new things with potatoes.... Can't go wrong with bacon
by the time i saw this....I was vegan....I tested it with a good friend he fell in love, now every time i go away and stay with other people, I make this and I've been doing it for about 3 years lol...
அழகுஅவ்வளவுஅழகு fantastic
My mouth is getting filled with water
How'd you cook bacon in the fridge?
Powered ranch dressing in your rub works fine as well, these look amazing
This was amazing! My family loved it!
this recipe so good and amazing l went try this
I just made it for my family to night thank so much we just love it
Try this with Lipton onion soup mix. Delicious, and put ranch on top before eating.
Hi Laura, what do you think about adding cooked chicken before you put cheese on
"where's my bacon though?"   yes!
Oh- I-will-make your baked potatoes,look &I know they are delicious, thank you for sharing 👍💞
Yummy 👍🏻😋❤️‼️
Where’d you get your baking dish with the handles? I need one like that.
Here is the correct word.
Love your recipes Laura! That looks awesome! ❤️
Could it be make with boiled potatoes,  I mean ,cooked potatoes to save time?
I’m confused, so 1/2 hour with foil on and 1/2 hour with foil off? Is that what she said?
2:35 cooked*
Does Laura have a salad recipe? Because I'd love to eat her salad...
THANKS YOU 💯.♥️🖤💚BROWN FAMILY ALWAYS DAPHNE COTTON 🦋💜.
How do u stay so tiny making and eating all the rich yummy food you make !!?!?🤔
Thanks for sharing, looks so 😋
I'm definitely going to make this for this weekend's Easter. Thank you. Update: I made this dish and everyone loved it! Definitely a keeper!
At What temperature were the potatoes?
Laura, this is testier potatoes recipe I ever had. Thanks a lot for showing this unique way to cook potatoes.
Cooking it tonight
I tossed the potatoes in a butter EVOO mix and a crap ton of spices before dumping them in 😋
Did she make the ranch dressing ... ?
I know Americans are big on that ranch dressing ... we don’t really do that here in Australia.. maybe some sort of Mayo or evaporated milk would do the job . I’m wondering what would be better for us here ? The cheese we would use would be called Tasty cheese. We call your green onions , Spring onions here .
Does anyone know more simple less ingredients recipes like this by Laura
Someone’s a lucky man, 😉
I didn't catch the oven temp...anyone?
What kind of ranch??😭😭
lipton onion soup mix works well.
Great recipe! Though I prefer to boil my potatoes for 15-20 minutes before cooking
Oh my thanks!
They talk to much . Just cook
@laura in the kitchen what can we use to substitute melted butter with?
😇🥔🥔🥔😇
This was a great potluck dish to bring to brunch! Everyone absolutely loved it and it was the first dish to go!
What do you all think would be a good "main course" (meat!) to serve up with this dish as the side? _____
Ooohh yaaa!!
Can't hear what's this white dressing. Anyone to help please.thanks
I just wish she didn't talk so much.  Just get to it!

How do you keep from weighing 400 lbs after tasting and eating with your family.
what temp in the oven?
Going to try this with jolopinio 😊
laura, how would this work with sour cream rather than ranch. I'm thinking it would.
La cucina Italiana è un altra cosa... Non riesco proprio a capire come fate a nutrirvi così per poi sentirsi dire che la popolazione è obesa.
Wow you can cook bacon in the fridge lol
I just made this.....yummmmmmmmmm
Can these be frozen?
You left out the chicken
I just made this ! Everyone loved it 💖💖💖 thank you !!!!!
Omg I'm gonna try this right now lol

Anybody try this substituting blue cheese dressing for the ranch?
Girl you lie again
She talk to much
I like this recipe,very simple to make
Sounds sooooo delicious!!  Going to make some this week.
Hi hun. I really don’t like ranch dressing. What can I substitute it with
Do you think that if you don’t peel potatoes that it might taste even more like potato skins. Just a thought. Thanks, Leslie
LIterally, it was NOT heaven. Figuratively it was heaven. Also insanity had nothing to do with the gorgous taste.
I love all your videos!! And your so pretty!!!
yummmmmmy!!!!!!
I will definitely try this recipe. Yummy 🤗
Russet?  Would New work?  what other kinds of pots can you use?
Do you have to put ranch dressing
Thank you for this recipe! I wish I could keep on subscribing😂 I'm making this for my next dish! Thank you !
This is perfect for hubbys bday steak dinner. We wanted twice baked potatoes but this is going to be perfect without doing all the potatoes separate!!

You make me so hungry watching these videos. I keep the videos on my playlist to make. Thank u.

Good and simple. :)
Randomly stumbled upon this video last night and sooo im making it right now. Its all youtubes fault
How could I add grilled chicken breast to this?
What if you left the skin on would that make the potato dry
I dont like ranch cause everything you put it on taste like ranch. But I see this working out. Ranch and bacon and cheese.
God's watches see all, stop sinning or face Hell at :24 use are using idol hands the three and one on the hand, stop!
HowToBasic has a competitor

can chicken be used instead of bacon
I did everything in this video besides the cheese (mild cheddar cheese, grated myself) and for the seasonings I used a generous amount of garlic salt, a little bit of seasoned Salt and like 2 tablespoons of pepper. Omg amazing!

Love your lip colour Laura
You had me at Bacon.
Made this for Easter and everyone loved it. Thanks Laura. Your recipes are amazing I'm a big fan. 😘
So if you were taking it over to a friends house, would you cook the cheesy part before or when you get there, if you did it before, would you eat them cold or would it be okay to heat them again?
I made these for Easter and they were so good I made them again today to use the rest of my potatoes. Thanks, Laura!
I love this channel and i DVR Simply Laura. The recipes are always easy to follow. every time i make one of her dishes my family Loves them.

I love your videos! But we don't have Ranch where I live :( is it possible to make this dish with any other sauce? Maybe sour cream or something. I'd really love to make but I'm kinda lost.
More pepper!  ;-) Me too, love lotsa black pepper on potatoes. I put a lot on homemade potato chips. Really great that way.
Looks amazing and delicious but honestly you should slow down when you are talking, I struggled to catch up and you looked a little out of breath hense getting tongue tied.
1:58
i just discovered your channel yay! i just tried your lemon pasta and it's so good! let the battle in the kitchen begin! thanks keep uploding please! i wanna try them all
Baking these now. I tasted them the 2nd round they came out of the oven and they are delicious!!! I added a little more butter and bacon. :) Sooo good.  A MUST TRY!
it absolutely confuses me how you and ur hubby eat like this and are thin....
i just made some for my family and they loved it, i would just not add the green onion cause it takes over the dish
I made this last night, and was blown away as to how delicious the dish was!! If you're a potato lover, I would recommend!
It was good but hard to make the first time. First time the potatoes burned but the second time they didn't and it was delicious..
tried it, and we just  loved it. 😄💞
boom again at 5:16...and again...where is my bacon....made my day
1:55 for just a little bit of green....you cracked me up...keep those special moments coming..Thanks Laura
ilike this and iwill hit the subscribe button
did you cook the potatoes prior?
Seriously you've done it lemme try it and I'll leave it in the fridge for 10 minutes for the bacon to cook completely... Hilarious, " This is just some Bacon I cooked in the fridge" Well if you've really cooked Bacon in the fridge you're some kind of magical freak... Seriously what am I saying I just can't help it cause it made my head spin and I think so deep about that.... XD
if I wanted to sub out the ranch dressing for sour cream with a ranch seasoning packet mixed in do you think the sour cream would curdle from the heat in the oven?
did you have a haircut?
1st it was unsweetened butter. Now it's bacon that was cooked in the fridge??/
you are a hypnotic gem love ya
Who thumbs her videos down and why?! What's wrong with y'all? 🤔😐
I made this today and even though I'm vegan, the person I made it for loved it😍😍
I tried that dish , it was soooo yummy every one loved it , thank u :)

do the Taco Bell cinnamon delights recipe  pls !!!! 😍
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Typical American dish -- fattening, unhealthy, cheddar cheese, too many flavors -- Can you even taste the potatoes?  This would be a great dish without the cheddar & ranch dressing.
Ugh Laura go vegan! 😩
Diabetes is in my family so I used your recipe, replacing the potatoes with cauliflower florets. Worked wonderfully and tasted great.
Interesting! I thought you were going to use ranch seasonings and not dressing. I bet it really concentrates the flavors and helps make the potatoes tender. Yum!
What temp do you bake the potatoes?
Can you please make sushi?, I'm desperate
Hash brown casserole pleeeeeeeease!!! :)
Im here after shanes ranch gummy bears 😂😂
Looks good!
I would love to see your recipe for beignets.

Laura what are you wearing on your lips?

Are those potatoes pre-cooked or did you put them in the oven raw?
It's funny, I've been hooked on your how to's that I now compare others to yours, and there's no comparison.  Your recipes and instructions are so simple, and easy and almost always in my fridge.  Thank you Laura, for always being consistent.
