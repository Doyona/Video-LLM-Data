That curdle happens when the sugar and butter has not mixed in and become fluffy.i saw in the video where the baker mixed butter sugar without mixing into a fluffy consistency . eggs were added and it became soupy and curdled.that time the baker spent a long time trying to get a nice mixture which she didn't.however she added flour which helps her batter👍
Hi, If I’m using self rising flour can I skip baking powder?
Best , foolproof and easiest fruitcake recipe i've ever tried. It taste yummy too. Thank you.
I also sus Malta 🇲🇹 no alcohol
Hello happy boxing day from Trinidad and Tobago  blessings I usually mix my eggs first but all looks good
hi JOYS can you put your Christmas.cake pls
Can i use cashew nuts ?
I made your cream cheese pound cake was the best
Love all your recipes and have been making them for years. Thanks from Pakistan 🇵🇰 ❤ ( those who don’t want alcohol can soak the fruit in fruit juice and it’s just great!)
My dad's mother had a recipe like this that she ended up taking to the grave since she never wrote it down anywhere. I think this is the closest one I've found that would be like what she would make, since I've read all her recipe books she used. I can't wait to try this recipe out and surprise my dad!!
Looks yummy Thank you for sharing 🙏💃🎶🎵
Thank you for sharing. I will make this cake 🎂
My favourite fruit cake recipe ❤️
Love your cake good recipe
I've just made this! I made it as an alternative to regular fruit cake, so I baked it in a round tin and reduced the oven time a bit. I also added 1 tsp of mixed spice. I was worried a christmassy marzipan and icing covering would weigh the cake down, but it worked brilliantly. This will definitely be made every year instead of the typical heavy christmas cake! Thank you for this recipe ❤
Hello, baking the cake with lower element only or both tq
@joyobaking. Can skip the almond flour ?
Would you mind giving me the brand of your mixer?
Still making this every year
Hi Stephanie, Is there a way to make this cake without using almond flour? I am allergic to almonds. Should I substitute the weight of the almonds with equal amounts of flour? Or follow the recipe as it is and simply omit the almond flour?
Deto😊
Hi mam, My cake used to rise very well, it would burst from the top, but the inside, especially the middle, would remain raw, what is the reason for this? Overbeating?
Where can I find your recipe?
This looks so delicious. I'm looking forward to trying it. I love fruitcake. Thank you so much for showing the entire process, this really helps.
Almonds , fruit cake
I like this  thank you
Can I use oil instead of butter.
This fruit cake recipe is really nice and good.. so amazing thank you so very much for this great recipe.. this fruit cake is so so great thank you so very much and a lot of love from planet ayurveda
Adipoli ❤
Αυτο το κεικ με τα φρουτα μεσα μπορω να το τρωω καθε μερα χωρις ποτε να το βαρεθω
Hi Stephanie I just stumbled on your video and find it real interesting. Where I live I can’t get almond flour. How much more all purpose flour do I need to add exactly for the recipe? Is it half a cup of flour? Thanks if you can reply.
No,me gusta q no la subtitule a castellano😐😌😠🥶
I simply love all your recipes, they r really wonderful. Thanku.
Hi if I don't have ground almonds can I leave it out
What is the baking temperature?
I finish baking this and the blue berry cake just now to bring to work as a Christmas treat. They are "phenomenal"!!!
I make this cake every year for Christmas and everyone who have had it loved the cake. Thank you for the recipe n wonderful demonstration 🥰
You can tell who are youtube cooks and who are actual cooks just from this one video.
This fruitcake looks delicious and very colorful. I am going to love this recipe.  I will be making it in the next few days.  Thank you for a scrumptious fruitcake recipe 👍❤️🙏
Thank you so much for taking time for writing all the ingredients for us. And I will make the cake beaucause of that. Because all the measuring been reaten nice and clear. So for the first time I will make a nice fruits cake for my mom for Xmas. Keep my fingers crossed if all come out good like yours. Merry Christmas to you and your beautiful family.
Thank you for sharing the Recipe of Fruit Cake..🤗😍
Thank you, Stephanie.  I usually make a dark fruitcake but this year I'm making the lighter one.  Thanks for your helpful instructions.  BTW, I have the Kenwood Chef Titanium mixer too, just recently purchased and I love it.  Have a good evening.
Just what I was looking for: a light version of fruit cake (even as I love all sorts of fruit cake). Will definitely make this & Not share with anyone, lol
Love to watch you baking very nice 🙏🏼
I’m hoping as a yes but can I eliminate the almond extract? Or can I add more vanilla?
You are so beautiful! Very accurate. Thank you
I LOVE this recipe. I made it last Christmas. I injured myself a few days before, so plans got downsized, but I still made this.  I am making it today, in October, as a Harvest Fruitcake, with dried cranberries, apricots, raisins, both regular and golden, candied orange peel, and the green angelica from a candied fruit mix. But I've already bought candied cherries for Christmas 2022 to make this again.  Thank you. This is a perfect blend of flavors and a beautiful texture, both for slicing and eating.
L will try it
Looks delicious ❤
I have made this fruit cake. My suggestion is that you make a double batch. Even the best fruit cake is something that I like to eat less frequently, but what I do here is I chop up extra cake and add it to Stephanie's vanilla ice cream recipe as I pour it into a shallow pyrex container. Use thick chunks of the cake for this. If you think you like fruit cake, wait to try fruit cake ice cream.
Ma'am for how long can we store this at room temperature?
Hi is there any alternative for ground almond? I really like to do this for my mom as ur cakes are always amazing.
Can this recipe work in a regular Bundt pan?

I really like all your recipes and just tried to make one now  😊
I love fruit cake too.  Since my family doesn’t like the traditional fruit cake with the bolder size pieces of fruit the smaller pieces of fruit would be perfectly tempting for family members wanting to try the fruit cake in the upcoming holiday.

Thanks a million for these beautiful recipes... I baked couple of your recipes n now I am very confident towards baking. My family enjoy my bake. Heartfelt thanks to you🙏

Hello...I.love all you videos a lot. I have a problem with baking fruit cake...all of the fruit bits settled in the pan below....:(....what to do ? I have tried dusting with dry flour, but no use...:'(
why do we actually add almond flour to the batter ?? how does it affect the texture or taste of the cake ??
Baking 60-70 minutes are too much for my oven anyway, so try checking about 45 minutes in to baking

Hi Stephanie,  What is the purpose of lemon zest in the cake? Can I do without?  I am planning to make about 6 loaf of fruit cake and give away as Christmas gift. I don't want to just take the lemon skin and just throw away the rest of it. I find it very wasteful.

Hi Joy of Baking - thanks for the recipe and I am delighted to try it over this weekend. I have a question here - If I'd like to bake 2 cakes and I have a small oven,  Question is when the first cake is baking in the oven, how long can the second cake (still in batter) keep in room temperature? Because I need to wait till the first cake finish baking then only put in the second cake. Hope to hear from you. I am just a beginner.
I don't want to add alcohol, what is the possible  substitute of that....please tell....

Jus did this! But without almond extract and ground almonds n it still taste GREAT!
Hi, can't wait to try this recipe however can I use sweet cond. milk instead of regular milk.. I like it more?
I made this last year. It was amazing. Planning on making more this year.
excellent recipe, can't  wait to try it!
Hi I like your recipes and I want to make the fruit cake but without alcohol, can you guide me thanks .
How many degrees because you only mentioned the time of baking. =)
Joy, mine turned out really dry and flaky... what did I miss? substituted candied fruits with regular dry fruits, added 4 eggs instead of three and added whipping instead of milk. I live in high altitude. Please let me know so that i can correct it next time :)
How do you store the bread and also could you put nuts inside with out compromising the cake. Thank you
As I say in the recipe, the soaking of the fruit in alcohol is optional. The fruit cake is still delicious without it.
Can i use it without alcohol...am musoim..
Yea i wanted to know where you would store the fruits after its being soaked in the alcohol and does it have to be soaked for two days or the longer the better?
Hi, I love this recipe but after soaking the fruit in rum do you leave it on the counter top or put in fridge please let me know, thank you.
Yes, I think you could frost this cake with a cream cheese frosting.
Hello, do you think it will be ok to frost the fruit cake with cream cheese frosting? Will it taste weird?
This is a wonderful recipe. I made it on Friday and my wife and kids loved it. A real treat. Thank you so much from London, UK. De-lish! :)
No, you don't have to soak the fruit.
hi I wanna ask if I have to soak the fruits or just use as they are and is there a substitute for alcohol??
You can do that. I would keep it at the same temperature, but the baking time would be different. Not sure of the time as I've never done it that way.
Hi. Made this cake yesterday and it was just wonderful. Can I double up the cake batter and bake it in a square pan. If so, do I still use the same oven setting and time of baking?
Great! :) lookin forward to makin this :)
Great! Thanks! :)
It can be stored for about a week at room temperature or it can be frozen.
Yes, you can use homemade almond meal. You could use any fruit juice - apple, orange, etc.
I wish to gift this cake. What is its shelf life?
Oh my God! This looks delicious Stephanie! I would really love to master this recipe by Christmas! Could I use a homemade almond meal (which may not be as finely ground as the one from a package)? And what fruit juice can I substitute for the alcohol? Thanks!
I would use a fruit juice that you like - apple or orange maybe.
Hi I love your channel, I wanted to know if it would taste better with fruit juice or without. and if with, what kind of fruit juice?
so good
You could use ground pecans or you could substitute the ground almonds with an equal amount of flour.
For this Light Fruit Cake I like to use a combination of candied mixed peel and candied cherries (can use either red or green). Candied fruit is actually preserved fruit that has been dipped several times in a concentrated sugar syrup. If you can't find candied fruit, you could just other types of dried fruits.
hi there m ur ardent follower I love ur recipes a lot, esp when u always give substitute coz it halps me a lot and make baking so easy for me, in this receipe I wanna ask u what kind of fruits are these cus I don't find them where I live
im not sure, but maybe you could add more milk, or eggs?
do you know anywhere in the UK that sells candied peel?
everything you make looks so simple and delicious!
Hi stepni your recipes are excellent and I have one request could post a recipe when we eat it sees like rust(but it have same ingrdients same like fruit cake.plz post it recipe
Yes, you could do that.
can i use regular flour instead of almond meal??
Most grocery stores in the States have candied peel during the Christmas season. Some stores do carry it year round, or you can find it on line. Amazon does sell it.
hey there, where did u find mix peeled candy?
Oooh this is delicious ,i made yesterday and come out beautiful without alcohol  Everytime i tried fruits cake all shrink even when add flour but yesterday everything was perfect ..thank u again
Hi, what is mixed peeled candy and please let me know where can I  find glazed cherries and mixed peeled candy?
Stefani, I love your style,your calmness,your voice,and every dessert what you have coming very good.I am just enjoy baking with you-thank you-dana
Yes, you could do that.
if i use the same recipe, can I bake as them in the form of muffins and how many will I yield?
The cake should still rise even if it's covered because it has baking powder in it.
If I cover the pan while it bakes will the cake also stop rising?
Yes, you could use a fruit juice.
You could use wine.
hai , can i use wine instead of rum or brandy??
I have baked the cake yesterday with some modification. I did not add the  raisins and mixed peel. My husband said it was one of the best cakes I baked. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
how can we make a cake more moist??
I normally hate fruit cake like that kind you buy at the supermarket. But this kind actually looks pretty good.
Hi all, i did not have almond power so i ground whole  almonds in my mixer and added that in the cake. Worked for me..
I'm sorry, but I really don't know.
Hi, is it okey to use almond powder milk instead of the almond flour?
The colourful crumb reminds me a lot of a Jamaican Christmas cake I made some time back. The light colour is most attractive, and the rainbow colours of the candied peel and cherries make it very festive. Kids will surely prefer this to a dark heavy cake. The demo is very clear, paced just right by one of my favourite Youtube presenters.
Yes if you click on the link in the description you go to the recipe page. Just above the video on that page is a link to the printer friendly page.
I love the recipe do you have the written recipes to print out.
Love watching your video...love trying your recipes...thank you Stephanie
BOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've never tried it, but you should be able to replace the almond flour with another type of flour.
hi joy.... if i dont have almond flour,almond flour can be replaced with any flour..........?
Almond is just one flavoring. Traditionally, it would use this flavoring, but you can substitute another extract flavor you like or just leave it out. You can also try to make almond extract if you have almonds available. The process for making flavor extracts is easy to find online.
I've never made it that way, but you should be able to use plain flour for the ground almonds.
i dont have dry almond,can i subtitute it with plain flour?
tthis looks fantastic.  some of the tips from this recipe might also improve a wholemeal, dark chocolate & almond cake I've been making
There is no almond extract here in Greece. Is there any alternative way? Thank you.
Yes.
Yes, you can make this recipe by hand. You can really use any kind of rum or brandy.
Coating the outside with a glaze and cherries sounds delicious. Great idea. And you could use buttermilk. Thank you for the kind comments.
Really wonderful and easy recipe. After the cake is ready, can I coat the outer surface with a light apricot glaze and top with cherry halves. Also, can I use 60ml of buttermilk instead of plain milk? I am a great fan of your recipes and you are able to present the proceedures with great clarity. Please keep up the good work. Meir
I love your recipes.Please can you teach how to make candy mix peel.I bought it pricy but it came out amazing.Thank you.
love it when you taste and comment on your food! :)
Por favor no entiendo ingles desearia en espanish my cauntry is Peru  Por favor si fuera tan amable
The batter will not be smooth. It looks kinda lumpy.
uh, im only fourteen(14)-years-old.. what does curdle mean? nice cake.
Hi Ma'am,my name is Joshua Moses from India . I just want to know how much quantity of fruits,sugar,eggs,butter ,salt, baking powder, do i require to make with 2 kg s of flour without any alcohol. just a simple dry fruit cake.
I LOVE YOU JOY... I LEARNED A LOT FROM YOU
I'm Italian and love your recipes, already made several of them (muffins, scones..) and will definitely try this one too. It looks tasty!
There is no need for me to freeze it, it'll be finished in the next 2 hours!!!!
Wow, that looks sooo yummy! I'm def. gonna try this in a vegan variation. Interesting to hear, ground almonds aren't that easy to get over there.  Here in germany, it is a traditional baking ingredient and you can buy it in the tiniest supermarket. Funny, how things differ from country to country. Thanks for this great recipe. All the best.
i don't have a loaf pan. can i use a 7'sq pan?
You can if you like.
maybe apple juice
Yay!  You tasted it.  ^_^  Fruit cakes don't have the best reputation in the States, but that looks awfully delicious.  I wonder if I could convince my slightly picky family to try.  I'm sure you have tons planned for the holidays, but I was wondering if you might consider making a traditional Christmas stollen?  I would love to see your take on it.  Thank you for all the lovely videos.
This a great explanation of how to make fruit cake! Glad to have this with the holidays coming up!  xo @TheHotPlate!
some people complian long ur videos but i lov it and to know every details , thank u
Does the Alcohol cooks off when I bake it? I want to soak the dry fruit what can I substitute the alcohol with?
For that thank you so much for your great accurate explanation!!!  Already I've made several things and they were all beautifully made and also tasted so great!!!  I guess you would be surprised to know that you have a fan "even in Korea"! ;) I don't usually leave any post but, as I was getting so much help from you, I just wanted to say thank you for your effort!! And I have this little wish to see your cook recipes,too!Thank you again! PS.it was so cute to see your dog in one of your video!:)
Hello! I'm Korean and I'm your HUGE fan!! Actually I've been watching other  video recipes at Youtube, and one day I happened to watch yours. Since then, I'm not watching any other recipes at all!!  I like the way you explaining things so calmly and it's really helpful.  And most of all, as I'm living in Korea, here we all use weighing method(and Celsius), but when I see most of videos, they were using volume so it was kind of difficult.
No reason. It's just the way I do it.
Yule Log Cake please!!! Thumbs up so that she can see this request<3
Good Video! :) I like how you show from taking the cake out the pan to cutting it and tasting it :) Awesome!
Thanks for sharing Stephanie... looks fabulous and I'm sure taste fabulous!!
yup got all the stuff mention in my pantry n fridge n X,mas was just round the corner so wanted to try it out. I left out the alcohol bit because my wife told me my kids were too young to take it. Looks kind of easy just mix n bake. Mix everything up in less thank 20mins but the baking too me 45mins ( was still wet when I stick a chopstick into the cake so I added another 10mins ) After it cooled I Cut it and notice most of the fruit bits were at the bottom.
Hi. What is the best substitude liquid to soak the fruits instead of using alcohol?
i think this is the first time you tasted the outcome of the baked goods?... :) this looks good... i'll try this one of these days...thank you for sharing :)
I'm 21 n I love ur vids ur teaching me what my mom didn't :) my daughter loved the cheese cake
you can leave out the step of soaking in alcohol.
Uhh... Im under 18... Should i not soak the fruit or will it effect the cake?
great video :D
Looks great! Thank you for sharing this recipe, I will make it soon.
It is a cake.
is this a bread or is this a cake?
if u coat flour on them that would prevent that
Your video is awesome im going to try your recipes soon
In jordan we called this English Cake :)
This looks really good! You should make something Christmas like next time! -3
Just one of those? I think I'm going to try making it this weekend with walnuts for my husband.  Just thought that I'd say that you're videos have really inspired me to bake more. I've always loved baking and making things from scratch instead of a box. Always thought that it would be extremely difficult, but you're videos make it easy to understand a recipe.   Thank you!
I'd go with walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts or almonds.
would you recommend using mixed nuts or sticking to something like walnuts?
Did you make this recipe because it was only released 3 hours ago?
I tried it but somehow all my fruits sunk to the bottom and the top is bare just cake :(
Can you please make a rainbow cake!!!!! I want to make one for Christmas
yes or dried fruit would work
Love that type of bread/cake!
I've never really liked fruit cake, but would it be possible to make this with nuts instead of the fruits?
Yes, the knife is white. It's ceramic.
As I mentioned just leave it out.
Usually a dry cake is over baked. Your oven may be running hot so the baking time will need to be less. Check it with a toothpick earlier and take it out early if it is done. Time should only be a rule of thumb. You could also consider buying an oven thermometer and compensating.
Goodness that looks so wonderful. Thanks so much Stephanie ill be making that for sure
A little tip is add like atbsp of flour from you bowl in the fruit before adding it helps so it doesnt sink to the bottom,
Love all your videos. Sooo inspiring!!
hi stephanie i owuld really like to bake this cake but is there any alternative for the alcohol?
wow  that a nice cake  1
