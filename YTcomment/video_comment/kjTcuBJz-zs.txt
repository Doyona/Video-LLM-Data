Thank you ❤
Thinking about you again
For anyone wondering what happened to Raymond—he got married in 2016 (confirmed via a photo on FB), which lines up with when he stopped posting on social media. I also found a photo of him at a relative’s wedding in 2022. According to real estate records I found, he purchased a property in Uniontown, PA in 2024. So ignore the comments that say he passed away! ❤❤

this channel is pure gold. Keep on posting, man!
Bravo
It looks good. By the way, nice cut on the beef. ‘You wok of holic’  😊
Milligrams instead of grams
I hope you come back man! Hope you are well.
My boy dropping the mic right now 🙇 if the rumors are true RIP.
It looks 1k times better than all of the take around here.
Verry Cool!!  Laszlo Montreal
Still thinking about you, my boy. Hope you're doing well
i cant click on how to make brown sauce 😥😥😥
I’ve cooked all your recipes. I never make the beef and broccoli recipes from tik tok. Only this
This was one of the best cooking channels back in the day, and still is after all this time. I tried his crab rangoon recipe forever ago and they tasted 20x better than any other channel's recipe. He's the real deal; cooking American Chinese food that you'd get at your local restaurant. Hope to see you come back sometime, man!
Thanks for this video. You are a great cook and a great teacher!!
The most delicious beef broccoli ever 😋
This looks amazing, doing it soon
My favorite YouTube chef ❤
Beef
Ilove all the recipe of the art of cooking I copy them and cook them they're  really good recipes  I follow him on YouTube  5 years ago now I am back thank you for all your recipes ❤❤❤
Interesting take on the conventional beef w broccoli recipes I learned and was very satisfied with. Adding the baking soda "velvets" the beef and I like the added carrot for color (and crunch). Of course, sesame oil is the ... bomb! Thanks, I will try!
Please make more videos!!
Wow I would have thought the technique would be the same as with the chicken with broccoli! TIL :)
Yummy !
wow it looks delicious, yummy, loved watching it till the end, it shows your hard work, keep sharing such lovely dishes,👍👍👍👍 ur friend here,  Hope to see you around friend BIG LIKE.    #WorldOfPanchPhoron
Can I get a link for the Pokémon burner you are using?
@gordon ramsey would approve. Will make this soon...
Look very delicious 🤤😋 I love beef and broccoli
Done support
This is the ONLY authentic beef and broccoli video that I have ever come across on youtube. I give you a standing ovation. 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
Wok n Roll.  Love your videos and your sense of humor
Lots of oil, how do you recycle it?
Absolutely beautiful.
not only does he talk the talk, but he also wok the wok!
Can I substitute something with brown sauce?
I am so happy to have This Recipe.Trying ASAP.Thank You Thank You Thank You.....
I bet a Chinese restaurant mafia got him because he exposed all the secrets
I wonder if the people who didn't like it, just couldn't find their own Charizard. The secret is to not be a hater
Please post Moreeee!!!
very beautiful my friend ❤️
very beautiful my friend
Thank you 😊
Hi. This is still the tastiest Beef Broccoli for me. And it's my 2nd account, I just found out you're still not back.
Very good vid
This is good food.
Thanks , many thanks from italy
Some recipe   there's still no information on how you make the brown sauce 😕.
American food!
Wow thats what i want for my beef... looks tender, and brocolli... that i always overcook 😂 will try that... thanks
Thank You, You are expert and very good person
Why baking soda..?  Its not gopd for health
What happened to this guy? I heard he died
Can u make video for pepper steak.. wow had no idea that beef and broccoli was fried. Then blanched in boiling water, ... always thought it was just stir fried. Now I know why the beef & broccoli taste so good from the restaurants.
So far, the best beef and broccoli tutorial.
I’m making right now this. The best recipe.
I gotta learn to wok
Nah bro too many unnecessary cooking steps. Who fries their food and then boil it after to remove the oil? Thats really stupid. You boil away all the flavors. Just sear the meat on a pan, the juices will come out. And thats way too much corn starch geeez! After, throw your vegetables in, and add the oyster sauce and sesame in. The juices from the meat should have thicken and create a sauce from the corn starch. I don't know how you got cooking im a restaurant but your cooking process takes way too long and in a restaurant time is money
looks so good,  will have to try it
Isn't he just adorable?  The food looks absolutely  incredible.
SURE!   LOOKS   "GOOD"
I love it, thank you for sharing
I just made chicken with broccoli the healthy way on my channel
Wow looks bloody beautiful
The best
Ali MA HARIS hu
yesss we do!!
If this dish tastes as good as it looks, I am sold.  Thank you.
Yummy  Needs some Brocolli
can I add mix of pepper & mushroom ?
I need one of those meat cleavers. ASAP!😁
You're a great cook,  please come back  🙏🏼🙏🏼
That looks so delicious
Still the best
The best beef with broccoli, we miss you.
Raymond, are you ok...happy & healthy?
what those brown souce any one can tell me please thanks u😊
Wow delicious recipe one of my favorite dish,another way of cooking i learn to day.
Sadly he passed away
It seems weird to place food you've just fried into hot boiling water, but ts nice that the method will eliminate the oily texture. The boiling water step is probably what neighborhood take out Chinese restaurants don't bother to do because their beef and broccoli dish is usually extremely greasy.
My absolute favorite Asian dish.
Big like 👍 Hello 👋🏾 looks good! All Done ✅
Which part of meat undercut?
Ny Chinese for sure
I'll wok the wok with the wok ,thank you Sir .
"The first thing you need is a Pokémon???"  Hahahaha... Fell off the couch laughing!  Love every recipe so far.  In a you - tube world where there are a million vlogs, you are consistently the best.   Thank you for sharing your knowledge and love of food!
My wife's favorite
the clickable do not click; art of cooking dot org is for sale;
All your videos are always such a success! You never let me down
Make me some Honey!
I’m hungry now
Stop your searching folks. This is the only recipe you will ever need for beef and broccoli. So delicious.
This man's knife skills simply amaze me.  REALLY good!
Does anyone know why he didn’t add corn starch before refrigerating? And why he added it after the hour of marinating?
man I can't thank you enough for this. hope everything is good with you brother
السلام عليكم انا من عشاق الاكل الآسيوي واتمنى ان تكون ترجمة للعربي  عن جد اتمنى ان يترجم لي احد المقادير بالعربي وشكرا
Thanks for all your videos man. My family loves when they hear your voice the video because they know what I’m cooking. Thanks. Happy Father’s Day if it applies.👍
Hey bro, we miss you. Come back, please.
Your tutorial is excellent...the recipe looks delicious. Thanks for sharing.
I can’t get the recipe for brown sauce to play can I get the recipe please.
I watched this with my mom and she was laughing when you were talking about the Pokemon. This looks the closest to the beef and broccoli I get at the local Chinese restaurant.
Xie xie very nice
Wok it like I talk it! Lol
Will there be a taste difference using water vs the egg?
I love beef with broccoli especially the way my Auntie Joan makes it. She adds oyster sauce to the gravy, it’s soooo delicious!
Looks yummy will try it. Thanks for sharing it
EXCELLENT MERCI
This is the technique that makes it so succulent!! I couldn't figure out why my beef was never like the restaurants. Tried this technique and family swore I had ordered it!! Thanks for posting!!
Excellent, will make it and love the puns... are you ready to Wok & Roll 😂 classic , keep it up 👍🏻
🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒
Look more delicious man.I love it to taste!...yum yum
Looks so good and yummy 😋 thanks for sharing sir. Keep up the great work and God bless you always!
Beef way over cooked dude
Enjoyed. Tks.
So yummy &  So Easy .Thank you so much.
Is there a substitute for using the potato starch slurry? Can the same results be expected buy substituting with a cornstarch slurry? Thanks
Is there a substitute for using the potato starch slurry? Can the same results be expected buy substituting with a cornstarch slurry? Thanks
😂 😂 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️😯😯😯Frying broccoli 🥦. 😠😠😠.  Man is confused 😕. Who has time??? 😯. Guys wash your veg, steam if preferred then stir fry.
Thanks mate you make my mouth watery. God bless.
Isnt baking soda sodium bicarbonate? Lol?
Thank you so much for sharing this.  I went through couple of recipes from others and was only able to perfect this dish by yours.  Great marinate tips which worked great.  A big thank you!
Would cook this but i would have to wok to the store first
Wok the wok
Wow so nice
Woooww
Raymond can you show us, how to make Baozi or Manapua pleaseeeee.
What type of beef meat is this ? Loin or??
Where have u been all my life. You are absolutely amazing. I'm sure ur some where living ur best life u deserve it ♥️
I can tell this guy is asian just by hearing his voice
Thank you for making this channel
Good advice from below, I’ve only just discovered these videos so do bare with me. Your videos seem to show that you no longer make them because of the times elapsed since uploading. I hope wherever you are and whatever your now doing you continue to be blessed. Your a star. Well you are in my eyes. Thankyou for these secrets and jem recipes. Humble regards Dave
Thank you for sharing this you saved me from ordering take outs and my 11 year old approves this recipe 😋🤤
Besides using vegetables oil...can we use olive oil??
His sense of humor  adds a better taste 😂
BOFIFI
...the fish sauce gives it a more asian taste...
...but fish sauce is used instead of salt...
dont worry! in asia all cooks have their special twist on the food they make! this one is very good!
My husband and I love to cook together, and your recipe is great for two people cooking side by side.  The frying and transferring to boiling water really is a two-cook-job, and we enjoyed every minute!  We first watched your video together, then we followed your cooking techniques, and our food turned out to be restaurant quality!  Absolutely fantastic- thank you so much for making this video!
Receipe was a hit made it last night and everyone thought I got it from a restaurant thank u so much 😘 do u have a receipe for make the restuarant style garlic green beans?
The puns are so funny to me
Unfortunately,  I only have a Typhlosion 🤔
can you use anything else other than corn startch
what type of oil to use ...peanut?
the best video i have ever seen om this type cooking
you are best ..very very  good .. thanks
"and that's how you wok the wok." LMAOO
Omg I love you’re video I am subscribing I just love your recipes thanks keep coming back please.
oh man you are the best where are you? feling sad
complicated recipe but looks great
You’re the only Youtuber who’s made it like it’s from the Chinese-American take out resturaunts, others tried but it’s not quite the same.
Some restaurants make this dish where the beef is not coated with starch and it's outstanding.  I am not sure if they use the same cut of meat you use.  It's so tender and soft.  Great video tutorial!  I am too hungry now.
You're awesome!
Awesome teacher his recipes are amazing just buy the stuff and follow the steps 5$$$$$ Stars in my wok !!!
My wife and I just got through eating this dish with some fried rice and it was delicious. I was concerned the meat was going to be tough, but it wasn’t, it was very tender also, I am allergic to wheat so I was concerned about the flavors not coming out right with the gluten free sauces, it came out real close to what I have tasted at restaurants. Awesome recipe. Thanks, this was my first try ever.
Hi just to let you know i love this recepe ive made this 3 or 4 times already. Thanks for sharing and making everything so easy to follow.
we are ready to wok and roll lol!
Looks very good I'm about to make some
Hi Raymond  I enjoy your videos can you tell me where you cook at, so i can sample your food it looks great...
And that’s how you do it .....you go baby yummyness
If I cook for myself I would buy rip eyes or tender loin and cook it without the use of baking soda. The baking soda make the beef texture soft but also make the beef taste like rubber when chewing.
What kind of knife is that?
Great personality and presentation, as well as great recipes, Thanks.
GOD that looks good!!
Thanks for sharing! I have bought everything else, but forgot about beef. Maybe I can use pork instead.
Looks good to me brother
This is too complicated
I LOVE Chinese food sooooooooo much.
I suppose it's not a good idea to watch this when you're hungry and too lazy to leave the house.
Why use baking soda?
Good
AWESOME
When I hit the lottery I'm hiring u as my personal chef.
So good I love it 😍 you are so cute 🌸
Well, this is one way to do it.. Lol
nice recipe
https://youtu.be/OlxZusU3NoA
Looks delicious.!!!.pls download the recipe of the brown sauce ..thank you.♡
looks great
Nice video now I know how to cook beef with broccoli.thanks
Wok n Roll lol
I made this tonight.    It is amazing!!!!
Great love u am TNT
Does the using off eggs or water to soak the meat in  make a difference in the flavor?
Wow,,, I'm hungry,,,,  😜beef with brocolli,, it's my fav,,, thanks for this video,,,  so yummy,,
Wow this is amazing I'm new to your channel & love you for this man I love & appreciate you for this cause I love Chinese food with a passion
I absolutely love this video, very educational as well as entertaining.
Just followed you're recipe tonight and my girls and I absolutely loved it. Thank u
Best recipe on YouTube. Thank you!
Wow You're a Crackeraraker! You make it so easy and yet so delicate. I love the way you present it; Thankyou Ray! Hope I can meet you one day in NY!
oh my god first time i saw this....i usually cooking this menu..but not in this way...i must try this...thank you..
I don't have a sharp enough knife to cook this.
would you be able to apply that technique to make sesame beef
How did you do the brown sauce thing please?
Wok on!
What a great and amusing cooking channel! I wonder why there is no more updates?
Your food always look delicious.Thxs
thanks for the upload, made it by your recipie to the best i could and came out so good and smelt like the beef and broccoli in our local chinese resturaunts.
hi! can you show me slowly how to make sauce please because I can't see it very well.
Oooooo Yummm!!!!!!👍👍👍
lol after the "And I get to eat it. You can't." I had to suscribe. lmao
That looks so yummy :) can you do a video on how to make mushrooms in oyster sauce?
Hahaha such a funny guy👍🏼😆😄😀😃
Make more videos
I have not made any more of this  but I have a question ,I have never tasted  what you call Hoisin sauce, so what does it taste like, Hot, sweet ,sour,  potent to a grimace ,what?  I really need to know because I can't do hot ,not very hot ,very mildly spicy.
So if I want to make 2 pounds do I double the amount of ingredients
Love the puns- and it looks delicious! :)
Very nice.....I absolutely loved the way it turned out despite not using a wok, but a good nonstick pan instead. The blanching of the meat and broccoli worked like a charm after stir frying in more oil than I usually use, but I blanched the carrot slices separately by pouring boiling hot water over them repeatedly three times, which made them perfect once finally combined with the sauce and other ingredients .....I will add that most if not the whole time the burner was at full throttle, so everything had to be watched close....go figure. This dish came out great the first time...Thanks for the vid and great recipe.
Wow this gives me an appetite for this food, but since I am watching it ,I must've already had  it. Makes me so hungry. I have tried a few times but now know I was doing it wrong .Thanks for sharing these great recipes.Have a blessed day.!
too much work! I will go to pick stick better! or a good chinese restaurant.☺
Why do you cut at a 45 degree angle rather than just straight across the grain? Is it just so you can get bigger slices?
This is a real American Chinese chef.
good
I like the recipe but like my beef and broccoli to be looser then the think gravy. Love it thinner to have the rice absorb it.
I use your mother sauce, or brown sauce, on everything. It's the best I have tasted and the closest to take out for beef, chicken and broccoli, Lo-Mien, etc.
that humor towards the end
Awesome. Thanks.
Do you mean you do not wash the broccoli ! ?
I like the background music.
will this still turn out as good if you don't have a stove that has 125k-200k btu?
the only difference (in the video) is that I put mine on rice
Yes, it looks beautiful & delicious,
It looks delicious.
I wonder how Chinese -American folks cook with a wok at home. I wonder if my stove is capable of getting my wok hot enough?
dude your not wok with yan so don't try to be like him. and your version of beef broccoli is to slow I do not recommend this to any one if there in a hurry sorry.
what the heck! i've never seen such perfect cuts!
Ok
Why baking soda?  does it tenderize the meat?
I'm not sure whether I hate you or love you for those god damn puns.
Chinese and Italian food is the best Good fun to cook and fills the hole!
it's 2:29am why am i watching this
I love this chef!!  Please tell me how to make hot & sour soup!
yummy😍
Is corn starch a suitable substitute for potato starch?
Hey, Raymond! you are coo, and super cooking thanks
Excellent recipe! I tried it and I loved it! Thank you for teaching me how to make this properly!
i want to eat it too!!!!!
Hi,  i would like to know which part of the beef it is..  Thank you,  it looks delicios
what cut of beef did you use? Is it okay to use cuts like chuck, will it still come out tender?
Good
se ve super delicious,
you did not wash the beef from blod!
can you make a video for pepper steak
I don't have a Pokémon but this dish was delicious I did not have the potato corn starch I did it with the regular one and still love it. thank you
I have to eat where this guy works!
What is the purpose of the water?
my little pony equstria girls
Love it . Thumbs up for The Brown Sauce.
seriously watching until the Pokemon jokes, burst to laugh-tears until the end,...the  best cooking instruction! :))  PS. goin to cook this today! (uh oh, minus the Pokemon and  advance rock n roll cooking skill tho)
can i use pork instead of beef? thanks
i made this tonight and if came out 5 fabulous! i added more veggies to it but its such a simple recipe and everyone was blown away.
no
lovely, I definitely gonna try to make it for my children.
Is brown sauce alcoholic?
That looks so good!
You think you fancy, huh!?! 😝 Keep Woking my friend
Thanks Raymond Can you post a vid showing the difference between corn and potato starch uses? And if I may, I have been looking for a good recipe for a Chinese dish with so many different names, Its basically a twice fried shredded beef. That's Very Crispy yet Tender and spicy/sweet has names like crispy beef in Peking/plum sauce or crispy chili beef. I Hope you read this, and excellent work! Happy to subscribe and your humor makes your vids a pleasure to watch..Cheers
I prefer egg whites than water
Amazing! Thank you.
u have 2 many steps
Thank you 😘 it was amazing
omg they are so funny!!!! *dies laughing*!
please make a video on beef with mushroom .. yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!
another awesome video! hey do you have a recipe for the Beijing beef that panda express has on their menu? thanks for sharing.
Having attended a few Chinese banquet weddings. I was surprised   to learn that much of what Westerners think is Chinese cuisine really isn't. what percentage of your recipes are traditional and what percentage are fusion.?
wow fantastic
wow. gosh i dont catch up. gimme
my friend you have a new biggest fan...really enjoy your videos
Thanks Ray for the wonderful play-by-play! Most of the other channels I've watched, didn't give the temperature of the oil...just presumed that we would know I guess. It's very important, when you don't have a gas stove. Loved your video!
hey rayman i love to wok it up. do you have update.s yet whats next my friend
This is probably the longest video Ive found on youtube describing how to cook beef and brocolli but well worth it. The best beef and brocolli recipe I have found to date and probably will be the last I try! Tastes exactly like my local chineese resaurants B&B if not better! A bit more to this recipe than many other video's out there but the extra effort is worth it if youre doing it right. This guy is definitely doing it right!
So delicious 👍👍👍💗💜
Great videos. You truly are an artist, as are all great cooks. Plus, your comedy timing is great.
I want tell you one thing..You are awesome..
LOL! I just clicked on this video and I must agree. Enjoyed the whole tutorial. This was my dinner last night and it looked the same in thickness and texture, I prefer the sauce not as thick. I'm the type, that has to have the extra sauce for the rice. Overall it looks delicious!
Why did you add so many ingredients, I think it just make it confusing
ohhh my god the charizard killed me :D beautiful dish
what do I do if I started with squirtle???
Hi Chef that looks authentic to me, great cooking proces, Im gonna try it your way. greetings
Good
Do I have to use that kind of beef ?
OMG that looks awesome.
LOL the video from 6:52 onwards.
looks so delicious  can you come and cook it for me lol its so good thanks for sharing
love it  made it it's delicious
So THAT'S how the beef is so tender.  What cut was that?
lmao that was hilarious!!
again what the hell are you doing!
gelatinous goo and broccoli
My mouth was literally watering when he said " quit salivating "  😱how did he know?!
great video..yep looks like the same kind..can't wait to cook some
Love the basic techniques: - how to slice the beef - how to slice the carrots - how to remove the excess oil from deep frying
I think it would be better if everything were seasoned with salt & pepper.
I saw this vid early in the morning, I use this recipe for dinner and it was delicious, all my family enjoy this dish, thanx for uploading and congratulations!!
Would it be nicer to add dried black fungus as well? :) Thanks for sharing the recipe! It look yummmm..
Love this guy......
Dude excellent recipe, i eliminated the oyster sauce because i hate fishy stuff but tasted awesome!!!
Total magic, wish we all had 'Smelly vision', thanks.
Boo, ripping off Wok with Yan's puns.
love your recipes man, I've made your honey chicken already today gonna make this for my family and the shrimp and lobster sauce also. keep them coming.
yeah!... keep teasing on how you can get to eat that delicious food of yours and let us salivate.  Are you a chef?... if so where do you cook? Thanks Great videos!... keep on making them :)
oh god my mouth is salivating lol..yum yum!
taste great!! easy steps and great personality!!
what happens if you don't put baking soda
You are the MAN!!!!! I made this dish for some friends and WOW!!! Was I a hit!!!! Thank you so much for sharing!!! I gave them your website and I know they will love the site just as much as I do😊
Hey! I love every channel about food since it is well kept and interesting! This video made me want more so I subscribed and waiting for next one! Have you seen any African food video-recipes before? Check out my channel too, I do African food! Kisses xx
I like much looking
I love the way you wok
Wow! Its so interesting:) but I would like to ask if the vegetables are too soft ?
Your videos are so fun and the humor is awesome. love the videos. can't wait to get started
Your videos are so fun and the humor is awesome. love the videos. can't wait to get started
Your videos are so fun and the humor is awesome. love the videos. can't wait to get started
Your videos are so fun and the humor is awesome. love the videos. can't wait to get started
You are really good teacher. Thanks for sharing. And I like you funny jokes.
LOL! damn a charizard.... Would it count if I have a combusken to heat it up? Also could I use chicken/turkey to replace the meat? plus I couldn't find some of the ingredients you listed for the sauce  in my local super market such as brown sauce. Are there alternatives or specific store I should find one in? I'm so going to try to make this (now that I have the kitchen to myself!!!!)!
"Who's salivating? I know I am. And I get to eat it.... You can't..."  LOL. What a jerk hahaha. I'm going to make this then wokout after from eating so much.
intense amount of work. i had no idea. now, i want some
What's the best beef to buy for this recipe?  Anyone??
can I just ask , is it ok to just do real garlic than garlic powder?? thanks
wok like me lol.
Thanks for showing on how to slice the beef and broccoli....:)
Again...best brown sauce ever!
Very nicely done.  Thanks for sharing this with us.  But don't use gloves.  Use your bare hands when you massage your meat.
God damn it, Ramen. I am starving to death and after cooking this dish you ask me if it looks beautiful and delicious.   I am eating my fucking bottle of Biotin right now.
Your cooking videos never fail to amaze me!!! Loved this recipe as I Have all of your recipe Videos! Thank you Raymond!
Adding some oyster sauce transforms it deliciously!
hi. can I replace baking soda with Meat tenderizer?
your a boss man gonna make this now
I love your recipes, they are soooo authentic!!!!
To cook the beef, can we boil it instead of fry it?
Can we do the boiling technique like you did with the chicken?
I love this guy
I don't have a Charizard....Can I use my Pikachu to cook it with electricity?
Sooo yummy
The puns and jokes make me smile, and it just makes it way more enjoyable to watch your amazing videos and review old techniques and learn new ones. Again thanks for sharing this recipe and keep up the hard work!
Hilarious. Delicious. Hilicious.
OMG.. thats some amazing Beef & Brok! got try this out and learn how to work the wok!
Looks amazing. . I have to say, your "walk" through instructions are amazing!
You made something healthy into something really unhealthy deep-frying all that shit no way.. looks good but its probably really cooked unhealthy.
What cut of beed do you use for this?
Perfection, just what I love to eat, I have wondered how to cook what you have showed me today.  Soft melt in your mouth beef cooked superbly...I know what I am having tonight...Thank you, Thank you, very much...my search is over.  Exactly how it should be done, you have the recipe just right, don't ever change it...everyone move over there is a new Chef in town...!!!!!!!
VERY NICE MUSIC, AND VERY GOOD RECIPES, YOU ARE THE BEST.
Another hit! One of the things I appreciate about your site and videos are the pop up videos you include within the main videos. For example, the video on how to make brown sauce on the upper right of this video at the relevant moment (helps if you haven't looked up the video of how to do it itself, or if you didn't know about it). I have my brown sauce prepped and in the fridge in a big pitcher, so I'm more or less ready to dish this up already. I know it'll be fantastic. Thanks again!
we know u can wok the wok but can u tok the tok
Oh wow I have to buy a Wok !!!
eeeeeeeeeeeeemmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yami
You are really good!
Where is your parents restaurant located?
Yum
Thanks for sharing !!
Well now I know how to "wok the wok" all I need now is a wok ( ﾟヮﾟ)
You're awesome. Thank you for sharing your knowledge in the kitchen, I truly appreciate it!!!
"the first thing you need is a Pokemon. Not just any Pokemon. You need Charizard." lmao awesome
abc
Make a Facebook book bro....ill add you man Dude i tried it and it came out delicious  Thank you so much and keep it coming with ur videos. Keep doing what your doing This is my favorite dish of all time I love broccoli and to top it off...with some BEEF!!!!!
usually when I try to cook anything I look at at least 2-3 videos if not more, but with this all it took is just one, you my man are a perfectionist and that is compliment, I like your stile thank you The Art Of Cooking.
Absolutely Perfect! <3 Thanks for sharing this! I will never buy this again. Hats off to you Chef!
Hey Raymond, my girlfriend and I tried this last night and it is far superior to ANY restaurant I've had it in. Much thanks for sharing your cooking wisdom. Anyone unsure if they want to try making this should definitely pull the trigger. We acquired everything we needed at a local Walmart so don't think you can't find all the ingredients easily. Thanks again Raymond, it's general tso's next I think or that honey chicken that looked amazing.
The absolute best Beef and Broccoli video on youtube........Thank you  TAOC!!!!!~!
Can you teach me how to make showmaine noodles from scrach , thank you chef i apretiated
Around here, Bamboo shoots are usually included as well.
why you always mix cornstarch to the meat? what is the purpose?
Good video and step by step instructions. However, too complicated, and loaded with fat, and grease.
how do you add a picture???? I wanted to share what mines look like after I followed your recipe!
and my favorite part was the word "Wok-Aholic!"
I love how you make your videos and thank you!
what do you call the stove you got there? i wanna have that also...some poeple just dont know the art of cooking with high flame

I just cooked my first batch while watching your video. And it came out wonderful. Didn't know I was such a good cook. Thanks to you. Can't wait to try your other recipes.
What kind of meat are you using
Simply delicious !! Thanks for sharing :)
Must say i tried most of your stuff and it came out AMAZING!!! Was wondering if you can possibly make a tutorial of "Mangolian beef"
Hi Raymond the beef and broccoli looks so delicious I have forwarded this to my sisters:)
This guy is awese!
By far the best videos on how to cook authentic American-Chinese food on the Internet. You should throw in a few authentic Chinese dishes that are generally only served in China, that would be very interesting. I'm sure your parents cooked some down home Chinese dishes when you were growing up, right? Or were your parents born in the U.S. also? Keep the videos coming, very awesome.
How many servings are your videos geared for? And I have a large family and electric cook top. Can I cook enough in one batch for all?
no time to make brown sauce? Try using Sweet Baby Ray's as a substituion and for different flavor. My husband keeps demanding I make this dish, and this one time I was feeling very lazy and didn't want to make brown sauce so I threw in the same amt for Sweet Baby Ray's and cooked it a little longer with some dark soy sauce with molasses. It was different but very good! I suspect other BBQ sauces could also be used as a substitute for broun sauce.
Looks absolutely delicious!!  Thanks a lot for sharing.  You've got good cooking techniques.  I must go cook my own.
This is how u wok the wok hahahah
Thanks for your post! I would love to learn from you as there's no official Chinese cooking school in America! I'm in culinary school right now and always wanted to learn what you do! Will you ever teach in person?
pokemon! epic whahahahaha
Now we are ready to "wok and roll" I love it!!! 😂☺️
hey I love ur Video very much.
thanks to you ill have my own buffet!!!
Everyone has their own ways of making Beef and Broccoli. I prefer to use garlic and garlic oil instead of Sesame oil. I do not remove the oil by boiling the fried Beef. This is because the process of adding the oil after the Beef are marinated already sealed in the flavor and preventing the excess oil from sticking to the Beef. I think the process of frying the Broccoli is not necessary because the Broccoli is already crunchy when cooked properly. I noticed that the Broccoli are cooked three times. This method might have overly cooked the Broccoli. If you use non American Chicken Broth then the Chicken powder and the Oyster Sauce are not necessary. These three ingredients contained M.S.G. in them. You could just use the Oyster Sauce and the Chicken Broth only. This is more than enough.
Man! This is the best restaurant quality of Beef and Broccoli. I know it's good. Because that is how I make this dish. I can't tell you how happy I am to have found you. There is one ingredient missing. Where is the garlic? There are some great techniques used here. Thank you for sharing.
This is the first time anyone has ever properly shown how to cut against the grain for the tender beef. Thank you!! Love your stuff.
ok
u r awesome!
Man your a fucking master you really are

Hi,  I have eaten a great chinese cuisine in melbourne, they are; 1. Beef with curry sauce (with lots of onions) 2. Beef with satay sauce (with onions and green pepper)  Would you share with me, the video of those dishes, cause I believe you can make them, both dishes are all stir fried, kinda similar with the beef and broccoli.  Thank you in advance.
Oh my God I LOVEEEEEEE you!!!
Wok n Roll! lmao ....too funny ...love your videos!
wokholic xD love this <3 I really like watching your videos ive tried a few :)
Are you from Vietnam?
i wish to know the brand of the device you poke in oil to determine how many degrees it is. how much and where you bought it from? thanks
I don't like the video, I love it I!!!! tried this dish today, and it came out perfect. I will no longer buy this, I will make it myself.  Thanks for the video!!!!!!!! Oh , I saw your Pokemon.
I don't like the video, I love it I!!!! tried this dish today, and it came out perfect. I will no longer buy this, I will make it myself.  Thanks for the video!!!!!!!! Oh , I saw your Pokemon.
Do you own ur own resturant? haha i see them ice cream cups :)
Can I wok over a regular stove fire and get the same results? And where can I purchase a wok?
Now I understand why the beef has that weird texture when I eat beef and broccoli /.\ still looks so yummy! Love your videos.
Thank you Chef. Hope i have the opportunity to cook with you one they. I always enjoy my visit here!
Holy broccoli !!! You're genius !!!
looks great ^_^
Keep up the good work, I love your cooking
nice videos lol...you just know that dish is bomb!
You're dish looks amazing man! Wonderful job. Love the part where you bring up a pokemon lol. God bless!
Lucky you, you get to eat it.  This is a Poke'mon luvin' house full of family n friends.!  Thank you for your deeee-lic-ious video tutorials !   Yum yum, super yum.
BEAUTIFUL AND DELICIOUS LOOKING! I LOVE Ur PLAYFULNESS! HAVE GOTTEN ADDICTED TO Ur VIDEOS! U CLEARLY KNOW WHAT U're DOING!   THANK U SO FOR SHARING SO GRACIOUSLY!
Why not use a whole eggs when coating the meat?
I am so happy that found your recipe. Thank you so much. Wanted to know how to do pepper steak with onion.
I was excited to try this until i learned i had to have a Charizard to heat my wok.
I really like your video! looks so delicious !
I was just looking for a beef and broccoli recipe but that charizard reference just earned you a sub
liked everything but the frying of the meat but i will try making the brown sauce then adding the meat this time
why do u add baking soda into meat??
Why would you boil it after frying? That would make it soggier than it has to be.
This is similar to how we make Beef and broccoli in my region- except instead of beef we use hot dogs. And instead of broccoli we substitute donuts. Other than that its the same dish.
I just found you ... You're awesome! Thanks for the videos.
I like it though took a lot of time...
What if i wanted to boil the beef instead? Would it work? and for how long?
What's the best oil for the high heat, i just wonder about all this smoking oil and it's health issues ...
Dude you can't just make puns, that's now how it woks.
lol pokemon
what kind of wok do you use? also the strainer and that big wok spoon?
just subscribed. Love your videos! very well done thankyou so much
Great cooking! Thanks.
why deep fry the beef? is pan fry not work?
1 lb of salt?? i think he meant 1g
is the process the same for shrimp broccoli?
you did perfect sir. thats what i get when i order beef w/broccoli
Hello i am your big fan, so would you please make a video with the Kung Pao chicken or beef? thanks
that beef way too much starch
Wish I had the skill with a knife like that. :P I never understood why Asian cooks always use such an overkill knife to cut small vegetables. But that's not to say its easy.
I'm chinese and I'm Raymond Too
Where can I find potato starch
I think you are a wonderful chef and very sweet also!!
Yeah, this dude works in a Chinese food restaurant.
You're so funny and cool.  Great Vid, I'll be making the beef and broccoli very soon.
this should be called the "art of complicated cooking"!
Great knife skills
Do you follow the same way if it were shrimp and broccoli???
This look just fantastic, I can wait to try this recipe... great comments YOU ARE FUNNY!
Your video says it serves 1-2. Do I double the ingredients if I want to serve 2-4?
At the restaurant I worked at they skipped the frying/blanching part but the beef preparation part is exactly how they do it.
Another great video with great humour.  You should have a cooking show for sure.
wok n roll
Pokemon????  LOL!  Seriously, your dish looks so delicious!  It's a bit more complicated than I thought, but it does look so good!
I love watching you cook....you explain everything so well...please continue to post these tutorials.....thank you.
Never found how to make the brown sauce?
What kind of knife do you use? And how do you keep it so sharp?
great..i love u
cooking to the next level
You're AMAZING!!! Thank you for sharing :))
mmhhh... don´t really get the point of fry something and wash it later... using the wok just mix it with the souce that was also NOT made in the wok. Looks good and tasty but that´s not really wok-cooking.
Loved it thanks!
Awsome video
I like this guy s way of cooking. Restaurant style and professional.
I tried it and it was great
I love your videos and your sense of humour keep Woking!!!
i love how precise it is too
i love your knife. what is it called?
could you use flour instead of cornstarch?
You are awesome, man! Thank you!
I love it . Thx
Your videos and recipes are amazing! Could you possibly make Panda Express Beijing Beef? I have tried a lot of recipes here on you tube on beijing beef and no one comes close but I have a feeling you could defeat it!
Bam! another spectacular video.
Man, does that look good!  Wok on, dude.
This guy is so awesome!! Subscribe it is a most do fellas!!
The prep and lesson on cooking is so very good. It was the first time making this Recipie. However, I (ashamed) admit that I don't have a 'Charizard.' I have an awful and irregular 'induction' stove in my rental.  I know it's against all things... And the elders would quake. It took 35 minutes (following the same basic stages - only with glacial slowness) but following the Recipie and most precisely the order of prep. It was (again given the stove - no Charizard here - heat of the weakest of stoves) One may actually be able to 'sauté' their way -as I did through this exercise.  The recipe and the method can work with mods made for your heat source.  It does make one think about the capabilities of the next heat source I pick (or settle on) ;-)
lol he said dats how u wok the wok lmfao but thank you im making tonight
thanks for teaching me........BEST COOKING EVER!!!!!!
Thank you I am making this tonight you're funny!  Thanks for the video very good.
is the mongolian beef the same way?
I made the mother sauce then made the General Tso' recipe and this recipe. Every tasted and came out on perfect. The only other thin is, is that I would love to see a chicken and broccoli video recipe if you could.  Great job with all your recipes!!!  Thanks!
The pokemon comment was awesome!!!!!!!!!
Can you please add a chicken and broccoli video recipe. Thank and I hope you had a Merry Christmas
Two thumps up ! I made it and it really came up wonderful. Thanx a lot.  I made general tsos chicken as per ur recipe , everyone loved it.
I want to make chicken and broccoli. Is the recipe the same except for the meat? Any changes?
PEOPLE! AT HOME! Notice how high his stove burner is? Yours and mine is about 60% lower and SLOWER than his... When he walks you through the frying process, make it another 30 seconds and 20 second to the original seconds....  HE HAD TO STIR FAST, and you need to let your pan sit there for a few seconds...   I TRIED IT. I wasted tons of meats and broccoli until I notice about this...   Didn't you notice? He is cooking in a restaurant kitchen. Not a home based kitchen. :P
Looks yummy...thx for the recipe
thank you very much.  great vid.
sureeeee does look "beautiful and delicious" lol
6;48 pokemon? charizad?

Dewd..... you WOK!!! It was kinda boring until the pokemon bit, caught my attention then all the wok jokes....good video

lol am i the only one that noticed tha he said pokemon XP
awesome videoo , best one ive seen , thank you
MMMMMMM!!!!
Shrimp fried rice, please.
I've made your beef with broccoli, lo mein, and sweet & sour chicken and I gotta say this is the first time I have ever had success with Asian cooking!  These recipes are FANTASTIC. If you would do a DVD of all these recipes with some additional, more traditional recipes and the print version (stapled together would be fine) I WOULD SOOOOOO BUY THIS!  I mean, hello Amazon!  Just tag me and I'll give great reviews.  Because of your videos, I've been frequenting the local Asian market every week!
I uploaded both of them on my channel.  If you go to my channel and click on Chinese-American recipes, you will find it there.
Can you show shrimp with lobster sauce and lomein
This recipe is phenomenal! Thank you Raymond for making this video.
you deserve more subscribers
man all your recipe is very good. if u can PLEASE show a video on how to make Chinese braised beef brisket. and Chinese curry chicken. THANK YOU.
Thanks, glad you like.
Contrary to popular belief baking soda is actually good for you, it's used in a lot of products such as toothpaste, cookies and it has some medicinal uses (ex. neutralized ulcer pain).  Of course, I don't recommend you to take a lot of it per day, just a couple tsp or so more than enough.
i made this beef with broccoli of raymond... it was my first time success in chinese cooking and i must say it tasted like any good chinese restaurant in US.. i even froze half of the sauce as raymond suggested as a possibility and i used it in chicken with broccoli, equally good.  raymonds chopping technique is remarkable.. you are my favorite chef now raymond..
What the wok! Wok you and your wok jokes! ;)
Health
Is baking soda bad for healt?
HEY Raymond, learning a lot man, love your technique, 1 request. show me your technique for shrimp fried rice, dude.  thanks happycamper.
a substitute for soy sauce would be oyster sauce or fish sauce.
Hi, I just found your You tube channel, and loving it. Do you have recipes for substitute soy, and dark soy sauces?
U r so funny lol:)
Never mind thanks you are the best
What does the cornstarch do in the meat mixing process
FOODGASM !!!!!!!!!!!!
Yours looks like mines when I go to the fancy restaurants take out places don't use the carrots. Nice wokin
just like me!! you are funny lol
U r soooo funny, love the videos!
I'll see what I can do.
Yes, the chicken with broccoli is made the same way with baking soda.
When you said you need a Charizard I about fell out of my chair! LOLOL! Subscribed!
When you make chicken and broccoli do you make it the same way with baking soda?
I learned some cooking techniques from you..thank you^^
Is the method the same for shrimp with broccoli. Keep those great videos coming!!!! Also can't wait for fried dumplings
Chicken with garlic sauce please!
Raymond, thank you for responding to my question.  No. You are not boring me.  Go on educate me, remember you are the chef and I am not.  hahaha  Also, please please please so me how to make salt and pepper squid and plum sauce.  Since you tutorials are nicely short and precised, please show me how to cook some more dishes :)   Thanks!!!
One question. potato starch is the same that we use for mashed potatoes or different one pls
Absolutely delicious yummy!!!
short story=potato starch taste better than corn starch when thickening sauce or soup= think potato soup. Long story= Potato starch is high in amylopectin, the molecular structure of polysaccharides... jk don't want to board you with science haha. The truth is, potato starch leave no aftertaste, it's neutral in taste, good clarity, high binding strength. Corn starch, when thickening soup or sauce, have a little aftertaste. It's best to use neutral thicker that way you can taste the sauce.
Thank You very much for this comment.
You will see my face someday around september 20 as that is the day I posted my first video on Youtube.
why potato starch instead of corn starch with water?
Lmao. That pokemon reference
I've subscribed!  Can't wait to see the char siu bao!!!  As far as the poke ball thing....I let my sons borrow it and haven't seen it since....dang.  I guess I'll just have to make do without the super pokemon.  :(   Lolz!  Some people on here are probably like whattt???? are they talking about!?  This Texas mama and her boys are stuck on anime!
I do, but I haven't posted yet.  To find a 1000 btu Pokemon, you have to go on an adventure and search for one then use your poke ball and catch it. lol jk.
Yes, you can change the recipe.  If you don't want to fry the meat, you could just stir fry it and boiled the veggies.  And the rest will be the same, just heat the sauce and add in potato starch and mix.
consider to healthcare, can we change the recipe, not to deep frying the meat and veggies? how to?
I want you to know I love your videos, and I hope you show us how you look like in one of the upcoming videos, because you are such a fun guy and I am really curious!
Hi Raymond! Just wanted to thank you for posting these recipes! Reminds me of the time when Bruce Lee first taught the secret art of Kung Fu to westerners. I've been trying to make Chinese food for years from various recipes and they were never up to par.  Yesterday I bought the ingredients at our local Chinese supermarket. Today I made the base sauce and it is delicious!! This will be my first attempt at one of your recipes and judging from the base sauce I think this recipe will be awesome!
Where do I get one of those 1000 BTU Pokemon burners???  LOL!!!  You're funny!
This is exactly what the beef with broccoli looks like here in Louisiana and Texas.  I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!  I also love both traditional and westernized Asian cooking.  Probably you could put soy sauce on a rock and I would eat it!!  LOL!  I was wondering if you have any recipes that you use the char siu with?  Like char siu bao??  Yummmmmy!!
I am so good at cooking Chinese food since i started watching your videos
This is a very commercial way of cooking chinese food in restaurant to obtain good crunchy texture and nice flavour. One more point to add on....You need a very powerful commercial stove just like him in order to maximise the taste and save time.
I respectfully demand more Chinese cooking lessons!!! Please.
Chicken w/ Broccoli recipe?????
does go a lenghty way to deep fry then put them in hot water to remove oil??? is it to obtain a better taste??? please tell me...I am a bit curious..:)
Im doing this tonight.
Love it! Great video but to much work to make. Guess I'll be visiting my local Chinese restaurant for that dish. :-)
Your videos are absolutely amazing!
I love your demonstrations. I've always loved eating out but now that find myself on a fixed income, your lessons have helped me eat my favorite foods at home. Please make a video for moo shoo pork, and Egg Drop Soup. Thank You so much. I'm 63 yrs old and this is the 1st time I've Ever written a comment on Computer!!!  My son would be so surprised. Ha ha Thank You
Why do you use baking soda? And is deep frying everything worth it for a better taste?
The NY style I'm used to doesn't have carrots and the sauce coats the broccoli more but this is just a minor difference. I am very appreciative if your video lessons. I can't wait to try your version. Thanks!!! I hope you will teach us NY style shrimp and lobster sauce, beef chow fun, mooshu pork and egg drop soup.
for pepper steak all i have to do is add onions and green bell peppers?
I looked it up, it's called a﻿ Mandarin Strainer. I too am interested in one because they seem quite handy.
Thanks a lot! I appreciate the step by step. It'll be a couple weeks, moving and such before I try this out but I'll report back on my attempts; theoretically with such instruction I should do alright but I am a novice in the kitchen. I have high hopes nonetheless!
The whole slow-mo'ing of the wok and the commentary had me in stitches.  The frying of the beef and broccoli in oil and then cleaning off the oil residue in hot water was really fascinating.  I do have a question, where can a mere mortal get one of those ginormous strainer ladles you used to remove the beef and broccoli from the oil?  Maybe if you me the proper name, I can Amazon it.  :)
I do it all in one pan, it's in a comment below this. I have an amazing nonstick wok I got on a great sale at Macy's, was a hundred dollar wok I got for 35 dollars as it was on sale and the show model and the last one left.  Nonstick woks are fine on electric stoves at medium high heat as long as you don't crowd the pan and do batches if you have to. You don't "need" super high heat to get good results.
Man that's a lot of steps. I just do the marinade/tenderizing, fry it in a wok with a bit of oil and then add the vegetables that I got started cooking in the microwave. throw the brown sauce in heat up and that's it.  Don't you find that the beef looses any of the crispiness after you boil it anyways? Searing it in the wok adds good color and flavor. Top sirloin is a great cut as well, pretty cheap and not as tough as round.  Good video as always.
i know where you're coming from, I have an electric stove as well, its not too different from cooking with an open flame. Just make sure your wok is super hot before woking, and use a wooden spoon to constantly stir the beef.
Oh! Another favorite, bbq beef tips. Any chance you'll be making a video of that? Thanks!
I just stumbled upon this, and another of my favorites (Sweet & Sour Chicken) recently. Though this recipe seems a lot more involved in time. Going from frying to boiling to "woking" . Can this be done with 1 wok and 1 pot? Also, I don't think the "woking" part will be practical on electric coil stoves (Unfortunate) so any suggestions or just stir?   Thanks for your videos. Subscribed and liked.
What about a Lobster Sauce/Shrimp with Lobster Sauce recipe? I've seen a bunch, and they're all off just a little bit... Is it something you've made or familiar with and could share?   By the way, you're one of the best cooks on YouTube. Keep it up!
I'm cooking this tonight for dinner. I subbed you, thanks for the recipe!
do you use chicken breast or chicken tights?
Will be looking forward to all you new videos. Thank you
Isnt this guy really great!
Didnt realise so many steps, no wonder mine didnt come out like restaurant style. Could I request you please make just the plain vegetables that come in simple sauce as a side dish? I havent found any such video on YT. Also it would be so cool if you cld teach us to slice things fast and small and how to WOK. That wld be a big hit video . Thanks
Whaha love your vids. so what if i dont have a charizard :\ ?
please keep your video coming I love it the best
Could you do a fried dumpling recipe? Awesome vids btw.
Thank you so much for the video!  Love the recipes!
Love The Recipe But what happen the chicken with broccoli?
may be you are fuzhou
Thanks for the explanation, makes total sense.  I will say that I wish I had one of those jet engine after burners under my wok, would make things so  much easier!
After blancing broccoli, stir fry ginger until fragrant, add back broccoli stir fry a bit, return beef to the pan stir fry a bit more , add sauce of your choice. The bottom line here is that﻿ it is possible to get away from using all this oil through correct stir fry techniques.
Mmm! Do you know how to make house chicken? My Chinese restaurant uses mushrooms and chicken. Its in a reddish spicy sweet sauce. I would love to know how to make it! I love your channel!
his way of making sauce was simple, but not uncommon. Chicken stock, oyster sauce, light soy a pinch of sugar and a pinch of potato starch. I normally just sear the beef strips after marinating in a light weight chinese cast iron wok, take out and proceed stir frying preblanched broccoli in julienned ginger.
The method I'm using is a combo of his way and how a malay chinese girl taught me a thing or two. First thing i learnt from him was that potato starch is more commonly used in china. Other trick i learnt from her was to dry drub baking soda on the beef, wait for about 15 min at room temp. Then proceed to marinate. Another trick i was taught from her was to flash boil broccoli in oil greased water for 10 seconds and take out as it continues to cook while resting.
Do you make Mongolian Beef i've been looking for a good recipe and all of yours have been amazing thus far.
Why do you blanch the beef in water after you deep fry it?  I understand it gets rid of excess grease but wouldn't it also lose your nice crispy texture?
Cool, yeah it looks like NYC style
Your Videos are so amazing & sincerely created,..seems like u r a good man.....may god always be with u, and grant u a lot of prosperity in ur live....pls make more videos
so first you fry the beef and broccoli to give it a crispy texture but then you boil it? WTF that doesn't make sense...looks good at the end tho
omg love you videos!!! what ethnic group are you from? just wondering
Thank you so much! Now I am able to cook restaurant style food at home
No wonder P.FChangs takes forever to make the food -,-
This is almost how i cook it at home. But I do it more like a guy from shanghai taught me. Oftentimes they prepare this dish in their home with chinese broccoli in a much lighter gravy. It's not like the MSG loaded overly saucy and starchy version with overcooked vegetables they serve in the west. Yeah I might sound harsh. But A lot of western chinese bistros butcher good quality chinese food.
Your the best!
man you really really need to make more vids!!
I love your videos. I think you're pretty funny!!!
Looks like nyc but no carrots.
yay!! a new video!......You have A BIG SENSE OF HUMAR....and that's the best. I love your videos. And now it's time to make this. Thanks for sharing and always stay blessed.
You are the BEST. Your dialog is VERY funny, also. HAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaHAHAHAHAHA
You get funnier :D
That looks like what we get get in NJ, but you forgot the roaches!
Love your video! Thank you for sharing!
Yay I always get this with chile oil. Now I can make it at home.  :D
