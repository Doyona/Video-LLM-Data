i love this ...thank you!
Buenos días medidas del cordón alguien sabe? Gracias
Do you have a video where you show how to adjust it once it's on your arm?
Yes, your's has been the best tutorial so far.  I wonder if you could hook the camera on your chest and aim it at your hands.   My eyes seeing the same direction as your eyes. I had to turn my phone upside down to see what your eyes were seeing. That helped me understand the small details. Thank you for making this video. 😊  I turned off the sound cause it distracted me. Yes I'm just a mess but my knots look pretty good.
A very good video. Not a person talking and waving their hands around. Straight to the point and easy to understand.
This is one of the best tutorial videos I’ve watched in a very long time. Excellent job!
perfect
Nossa!! Haha melhor vídeo, já vou tentar aqui...
This slides like five times max, this does not work.
If only this vid showed a little more clearly how to cross the cord ends in the beginning
This sounds like a stolen video
ıt worked wıth me thanks💝
Really helpful. I finally got it. Thanks 🙏 so much. 👍☮️🌞🌟
Il faut bien comprendre comment réaliser un nœud coulissant pour ma part il faut que je regarde plusieurs fois votre tutoriel pour bien comprendre comment je vais le réaliser pour moi même. Merci 😛 pour votre partage 👍 ❤
This is my go-to tutorial every time I want to make a new necklace for my crystals.
Saved. This is my go to vid to get these knots right. Thanks again.
Not sure why it would be recorded upside down
I did it I did it GOD!! Thank you.
Perfect, thanks ❣️
olá, sou do Brazil, amei, aprendi com muita facilidade, obrigada 🙏🏻😍😘
Perfect !!! Thanks.

This is the best Tutorial of this type of knot on YouTube. I couldn’t follow the others.
Yes! Thank you! Even I figured out how to do it, watching your tutorial! Grazie mille, muchas gracias
Best tutorial, I just tied four of my necklaces successfully, many thanks 🙏
Thanks! Tip: if videos are too fast still, hit the gear symbol, then playback speed, and you can change the speed up or down. I only recently discovered this 😆 Also, unless you have a huge head, 30" / 76 cm of rope works perfect.
Thank you
Thank you! This is what I been looking for!
Literally watched this dozens and dozens of times. You're doing it right in front of me like it's a magic trick. Dumb, blind old guy fumbling around with a piece of string for 45 minutes straight lol
very nice thank you

Hey! Where did you get your string from? Does anyone know what kind of material it is?

This is very helpful. Thanks for the free video. x
"Take a look it is very very easy"  Me, with dyslexia: *A H*
oh so it's basically noose knot but for both ends lol anyone who had had suicidal thoughts by hanging themselves can do this easily - me
Best one I have tried,thank you!
Thank you 4 that video. 👍👍👍👍
Be sure to either put a dab of glue at the knot ending or melt it with a lighter if the cordage can be melted 😁 This will make sure it does not come undone!
Thankyou

The simplest tutorial!!  I got it on the first try.  Mahalo from Honolulu, Hawaiʻi
ขอเบอร์ด้วยครับ
Wonderful and informative - now I have my necklace back!
Thank you.
Thank you for the video! I tried it and it worked perfectly
Excellent - thanks.
What do you call that cord again?
Thank you
Thanks for the video. I made one, with some pretty copper beads on it. It's nice to not have to worry about cord ends, crimps, etc. And customers think the slide knot is cool.
Thank you
Very easy to follow - thanks

Skip to 1:22 to begin...
Thang you
hsashj HOW
Thanks
انه فاشل  ليعرف يشرح كيف يصنه
Why do all you knot guys feel like you need to give history etc of the knot& your life?? Just tie the damn knot already.
Fantastic! I bought a delightful abalone necklace with black cord sliding knots but then they came undone and I sadly put the necklace away for two years! Now, thanks to your video, I've redone the knots and I'm wearing it again right now! Thank you so much!
It's better to say the extra information after the main significative part of the video.
You take too much time to get to the point
1:23 starts the video
Thank you. I could make a nice bracelet.  Nice !
Well I would like to say thank you, very clear directions and thank you for taking your time !!!
Awesome ! : )
I hope this is as easy as it looks
my knot is kNOT sliding
I love it.
my knot is slip knot... uhh just a joke
great
yAAAY I did it!
Thank you!
Excellent tutorial!
The person got very beautiful hands.😍
Thank you for the video. I wanted to use this knot on the lanyard for my walking stick. I didn't have enough leather string to tie two knots and have a big enough loop. So I just tied an overhand knot on the other end and pulled it tight. Voila! A nicer looking knot than the double overhand knot that it came with and very close to the same size loop as before. So this variation can be used for maximum length in a loop.
Can't see a thing with his hands in the way.
Thank you  worked great the first time
Helped me a lot. Thank you!!
Got it! Thanks!!!!
Thank you so much very simple to follow

Thank you! It's hard to find a good tutorial these days and I really like this method
why does no one show how to put on bracelet and tighten it.. it appears you need two hands, so maybe you use your teeth to put it on and then tightening...I can't figure it out.

I normally don't like video tutorials as people tend to ramble on and on and repeat themselves... but this tutorial is EXCELLENT, TO THE POINT, and PERFECTLY explains the process. CRYSTALDREAMS - you could start a side business and coach the inept in how to make video tutorial!
Great tutorial - I made one perfectly first go, thank you!
How do you determine where to place a single gem on the leather cord before making the sliding knot? So the gem is essentially centered on the finished bracelet?
Very good video....thank you...

A sliding knot
Nightsongs, i agree with you. There are many videos such as hairstyles and jewelry making that i get excited to learn, however they either have music playing which competes with the instructor or they simply don't review their video for clarity both in speaking and especially in the instruction being clear and close, actually from the viewers point of watching. This is  good, i hope the rest of the videos are done as well. Thanks for the vid!
What's the name of this track?
That's a move I would make!!!
Like it me gusta 100 por ciento cora arriba Mexico
Thank you so very much for teaching me this knot I have been trying to do this one for awhile but could never find a video showing such a closeup of how to do it. Thank you again for your help, gave a thumbs up and subscribed .
Great clear demo,thank you!
Excellent, clear and easy!
Thanks for showing HOW to do it! Everyone else just skims over it or doesn't show it up close! NOW I can DO it!!!

Took me a little while because i'm not very patient but i got there, thanks a lot!
thank you! You made it look so easy. I will try it for sure ,xxoo
Fabuloso. Más claro, imposible.
Thank you. Simple and clear.
Thanks!
Pressed enter by accident. This tutorial was super easy to understand. Got it the first time I tried. Again thank you so much!
Thanks so much for this video! My friend gave me his necklace to watch over while he was in basic training and it kept fraying till it broke. Was gonna pay someone to fix it this weekend then I got a text this morning :" guess who's coming home in 5 hours!" Panic Mode activated!!!
Wow, thank you so much for this video!
Thank you!
Great tutorial! Easy to understand and follow, I'm gonna be one crafty mama!
Is it possible if you only make one knot? is there any difference?
A small bead on the end would keep the end from coming through.  Make the end longer, add bead, knot it and cut off excess.
thanks a lot had a pendent with a sliding knot that came undone. keep trying this worked perfect once i got the hang of it.
Very, very good! Well explained and easy to understand. Thank you.
Really good instruction! I have done my bracelet :)
god praise the internet!
VERY COOL!!!!! Thank you!!!!!
FINALLY! A video that really shows how this is done! Thank you so much!
1:23
Had to practice it for about 10 min till I got the hang of it.  For anyone else in a hurry, he starts at the 1:00 .

THANK YOU SO MUCH!! THIS IS FANTASTIC!! And,,SO EASY!!! Was not totally sure how long to make it,,I thought I heard a meter?? Really appreciate your work!!
Thanks a lot for this lesson!! :)
THANK YOU YOU SAVED MY LIFE
I guess you just need to cut off the edges (that was used here to do the second knot)
i guess he/she wanted to say : How do you make one knot that slides when you want to open the bracelet or close it to secure, it's going to be great to fit every hand!
Easy tutorial, thanks :)
How could you make 1 knot for bracelet, but not for a string like your clip?
Thank you so much!  Very helpful.
Thank you for sharing! Excellent and clear demonstration. I'm going to make some bracelets now..
Simple demonstration, no nonsense  Love that video :)
success! and then i realized i forgot to put the bead on...
Thank you!
1 meter is about 39 inches right..thanks for this.

I love this, I always make things difficult, you make it simple! Thank you!

I would rather say well-groomed - impressive. :)
You have very feminine hands!!! Eh, who cares. Thanks for the help! You're a life saver!
