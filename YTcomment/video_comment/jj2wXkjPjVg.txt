Has anyone tried this recipe with Jumbo muffin/cupcake molds?
I made these for my family tonight as our dessert. The only change I made, was that I used semisweet chocolate chips.  These are THE BEST chocolate chip muffins I have ever pot in my mouth!  They were a hit with my family, too.  Thanks so mu for another great recipe!
Yummy!! That’s delicious 😋
❤❤❤❤❤
if i do not have sour cream? any alternative?
They look so good! Can’t wait to try this recipe Thanks for sharing ✨
Hi, Laura can I replace the sour cream with plain yoghurt?
Love the way you cook! (And you're so pretty that makes all the progressing become more pleasant  😊)   Your Panna Cotta video is my favorite. This one as well 🤭✨ you were right that it sooo miraculously simply and easy but the taste is super!
Hi Laura ! Looks amazing ! Can i use 2/3 white sugar instead of white and brown?
Can I use oil instead of butter?
Wow that looks tasty and delicious thank you
I use this recipe every time I make chocolate chip muffins. I absolutely love it. One thing I do different though is I don’t use the entire bag of chocolate chips. I use only about a cup or so. The whole bag seems to be too much chocolate
Omg Laura! These turned out absolutely fantastic!! Soo happy with these muffins 😍💜💜💜
How's your 👪 family and little too cute Mia
Looks good Laura i loves your hair up and your 💄 make up
I made this today. It’s not a good recipe at all. 👎👎👎
Why you didn’t tell us how much like all the measurements how much we need flour how much we need milk
What can I substitute sour cream with?
I tried the recipe out and it turned out so good!!! Even tried a vegetarian version and it turned out amazing!!! 1 egg= 1/2 banana
how much buttermilk can i substitute for sour cream?
If I don't have sour cream
Best chocolate chip muffins! I have baked them a couple of times and they r the best!
my chocolate chips melted and still sank to the bottom
any alternative to sour cream
How much of everything
Easy, peasy! Very cool!

Can we use buttermilk in place of sour cream?
Yes. I always put a tiny bit of cinnamon in my chocolate chip cookies. Yummo.
I don't have an oven here if I'm going to steam that what's the results still the same or?
Oh my goodness. Laura I love to watch your videos, but never actually make any 😊 this is the first I have tried and they are absolutely delicious. Yum yum so moist and chocolatey 👍thank you so much!
Boy did you get me craving some. Question- would you do the same trick for the chocolate chips if you were going to make chocolate chip pancakes?
The muffins I baked didn’t “crack “ much on TOP, any idea why?
Just made thes without the sour cream and they turned out great. Thankyou for the upload! 😀

I made these today with my 4 and almost 2 year old kiddos, because they're both super into helping me bake lately, and they turned out soo yummy!! I've been watching the oldest of Laura's videos, starting with episode 1 and so on, and so I got the idea to add orange zest to them. It is fantastic!

Your muffins where so amazing and good thanks it was so fun to make with my sister 😊
I could only try this out if my mum ever lets meh...:(
How do yours always come out all fluffy and big at the top mine there always flat 😭
i made these..these are the best muffins i've ever baked.. i replaced unsalted butter with coconut oil and instead of 2 cups all puprose flour, i used 1 cup all purpose flour, 1/2 cup oats and 1/2 cup wholewheat flour.. the muffins were crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside.. just perfect!!  I also did another variation.. instead of chocolate chips, i added one ripe mashed banana and 1/2 cup shredded coconut.. baked for 20 minutes.. again with mix of all purpose, oats and whole wheat with coconut oil.. these were amazing as well!!
does it have to be whole milk?? Can it be skim?
how important is the vanilla extract?? I have all the ingredients except for the vanilla extract.
I've never made muffins before, then it tried this recipe and they were SO good. Made it twice now. I used guirrideli (however it's spelled) milk chocolate baking chips and it was just so good.

Can someone please help me. I never usually fail when following a recipe but these cakes came out quite dense and I do believe it's my fault as I must have converted some of the measurements wrongly. However I'd like to know what I may have added too much/less of for my cakes to come out quite dense and scone like as opposed to light and fluffy. Thank you x

Do I have to use sour cream?
way better than a lot of other recipes I've tried and I've tried a lot of chocolate chip muffins that weren't so good, but this one is yummy soft moist, still good the next day and cold, the chocolate chip quality helps too.
If you don't have sour cream use yogurt or add few drops of lemon juice to milk or any vegan milk, let sit 10 mins.... You have buttermilk substitute.Use as sour cream.Only for baking. Works fine!
Used EnerG egg replacer and made it vegan!they are awesome! Melt in your mouth! I wanted a dome on top, so I baked @425F for first 5 mins and 400f for 8 minutes. Thank you so much for the recipe!
or plz make coffee cake

Every time I print out a recipe and get to the end of making it, I read the little P.S. and it always feels as if though you were right there baking with me. I guess that's why those recipes always turn out perfect;) thank you!

Sour cream nefer would have thought of that.  But  it seems like it is good with sour cream.

Chocolate  chip cake
Can use buttermilk instead of sourcream?  (;
Yummy
Does it have to be whole milk ?
Can bake without brown sugar???
yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!looks so GOOD
I have my own go to chocoloate chip muffin recipe that's similar to this, but I will definitely need to try it with a hint of cinnamon. I also never premixed the chocolate chips with the flour. I'll have to do that next time. Thanks for the tips Laura! Those of you that have concerns about using sour cream or buttermilk, I actually used plain yogurt instead. We always have yogurt in the fridge and you still get that moist texture. If the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of sour cream or buttermilk take the same amount of yogurt instead
Any substitute for egg for this recipe?
Love how you make these videos easy and simple to follow.  I can't wait to make these muffins for my Grandson (in grade 1) next week for a school activity.  tyvm
i do think that the chocolate chips spread evenly on the muffin is because the batter was really think and not because they were coated with the flour..^^    sorry for bad english...
hi i love laura vitale subscribe  if watching in 2015
Making them almost every week, my kids love them. Thanks for this supper duper recipe.
Make a.  Bigger. Muffins
Can i use any type of milk m PLZ respond SOMEONE!!!!!!!!!!
Hi Laura. Could i substitute the sour cream with buttermilk??
I like your childish attitude and expression more than making it muffin,You are so cute,
I heard that if you use your fingers to mix, you can get a good feel of eveness.
can I use other kinds of milk?
Can I use baking soda instead of baking powder? I'm making this today so please I need a really quick answer!
If u bring 10 of your chocolate chip muffins to Canada in country hills I will give you 100$
My family and friends loved them! Such a great recipe and treat. Caramel slice is a recipe I'd love to see your version of.
you are very beautiful
Hi,  I want to know how long can i store them...
Hi guys! Can you use all purpose cream as a substitute for a sour cream?
Do you need to put the sour cream in, and are there any substitutes for the sour cream
Ingredients: 2 cups of Flour 1 Tbsp of Baking Powder ½ tsp of Salt 1/8 tsp of Ground Cinnamon 1 12 oz Bag of Milk Chocolate Chips 2/3 of a cup of Whole Milk ½ cup of Melted Unsalted Butter 2 Tbsp of Sour Cream 2 Eggs ½ tsp of Vanilla Extract 1/3 cup of Granulated Sugar 1/3 cup of Brown

Do I need to sift my flour
Why is my muffin mixture so wet

Definately no suggestions...haha!hungry again,thanks for sharing
Love you Laura. One thing whenever I tried your never got anything bad, second thing I made your chocolate chip muffins these are awsum and I really like your secret ingredient sour cream it's made a big difference in taste. When are you visiting England let me know, Please. I wanna meet you.😍
After mixing all the ingredients, my muffin batter came out brown.... on both times I made it. LOL. Could it be the brown sugar?
Laura, you made an awesome job and I saw you make chocolate chip muffins and I love them.
Can't I use sour cream?
Laura im very new to bake so i've just a microwave what degree with the muffins? sorry with my english ^^ hope you not mind
wow i love you laura but my english is so poor so you speak so fast for me but i love it ^^ so i need the ratio of your muffins ^^
Could u use like normal yogurt instead of "ur secret ingredient" heheh
Hi Laura,   I tried the recipe twice but my muffins come out flat on the top. Please advice on how I can correct that.  Thanks,  Soumya
sweet!
Why aren't you sayinng how much? Btw I can't make muffins without that so not very helpful....
Laura, can you make a pineapple mocca late cupcake? it is a cupcake that has a pinapple filling and has a melting chocolate side. the topping will be a small amount of whipped cream and a frozen chocolate on top. It can work with a chocolate syrup too
What are the measurement? These recipe is not complete. Still thanks for your time

Hey I love your videos ....thank you for the ideas
Yummy chocolate chip muffin
Hi Laura, I like your video a lot! One question pls. In your tip at the end of the recipe, you say sour cream will make the best recipe for muffins. Should I use it for all types of muffins? But in some other recipes of muffins, I dont see you use sour cream but butter only or vegetable oil instead. Should I add sour cream in those recipes? and how about the measurement? Thanks
Pls give me whole ingredient
Can you bake without mixer
laura u have to say how much of every ingredient, ur stuff is perfect bt u piss me off by not saying how much
i need to know how much flour sugar ......
Hi Laura ! I started watching your videos and great but there is any chance you could put in your recipes different types of measurement ? You would reach a wider audience! I don't understand them and can't try your lovely recipes. 😢
Great video! But, i can't understand how many grams in 1 12 oz Bag of Milk Chocolate Chips you said? Please let me know. Thanks a lot.
Hi laura! I just wanted to tell you that I made these today, and they were so divine! Instead of making twelve regular sized muffins, I made six Texas sized ones! They were so delicious thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

How do people know how much flour and everything else she used when she doesn't say how many cups. I don't want to bake these til I know exactly how many cups, teaspoons etc she used.
You don't tell anyone how many grams of the ingredients that we need?
if you let the muffins sit over night in foil it tastes store bought
Is it possible to replace the sourcream with plain yogurt or greek yogurt?

Can you make a recipe for chocolate chocolate chip muffins plz.
i love your video
Can you make these into miniature muffins
Man
Cheers!
Mine came out perfect
Tastey
she talks weird when she tries to talk fast
Yes because you woulden't get the same consistency
Double chocolate chip muffins please!
Also, do I need to sift the dry ingredients? I already tried it (same ingredients and measurements) but it didn't turned out like the one in the video
Man if you have kids they are lucky bastards. They get to eat all of your food <3
I followed all the steps and I have same ingredients except for the sour cream, I used plain yogurt. The consistency of the batter is not the same. It's liquidy.
would it make a difference if you didnt melt the butter and just used normal room temperature butter?
I made these today and they came out great! I didn't have sour cream on hand so I substituted blackberry Greek yogurt (it's all I had in the fridge). You could barely taste a hint of berry, which I liked, and they came out very moist. Quick and easy!
Omg look tasty
btw I already made it. I LOVE IT!!!!!! :)
omg looks so good
oops cook
Hazel Goh mine turned out like that but cok it and toads good
This recipe is so good!
Guys, you can use plain yogurt as a substitute for sour cream.. ;)

Thanks for the recipe. The cupcakes turned out great and very delicious.
Do you have to use brown sugar?
my batter turned out liquidy D: what did i do wrong?
Hi, Laura! I want to make this recipe but I have some doubts about the flour. I'm new at this, is the all-purpose flour the same "flour" you mention on your website?. Also, if I have self-raising flour, should I use the same measure as you indicate for the flour? I hope you can help me :) Thank you
id like to taste your muffin if u know what i mean
What could I use other than sour cream?
Thank you!!
I love ice cream
I can't heat my oven to 400!! It only goes up to 250, what do I do?

Could you make death by chocolate cupcakes?
Great recipe!  Thank you
my little sis love chocolate chip muffins
Kind of looks like cookie dough when it was in the bowl
Can you use 2% milk or does it affect the consistency of the mix
i wish i was there it looks so good
Can you please give me the measurements clearly

Got a Laura In The Kitchen Advertisement before the video played :D

Yes you can plain yogurt or whole milk as a substitute
Can I just skip the sour cream?

I made these using your recipe this morning and they are heavenly! I just replaced sour cream with Greek yogurt, vanilla extract with powdered vanilla extract, and i used normal sugar instead of brown. I just didn't seem to find them where I live. And they are still sooo soooo delicious!
shes so cute... haha...
Really love this VDD. I watched many times and going to make.
i'm always missing ingredients
I've baked sooo many muffins, but non of them were good enough. Then I've discovered your channel and saw so many fantastic recipes and these babies and decided to give it a shot! That was the best decision I've made. They are absolutely fantastic, divine... so moist and delicious, you've left me  completely speechless with this recipe!!! These are God sent, thank you so much for sharing it! Definitely the best muffins I've ever baked and ate.. suuuper delicious! You're fantastic!
Laura I just finished baking them and I' nervous to see what it tastes like! I'll put it on Twitter, names Jousa1Lee

I love this recipe, its so easy and my grandchildren love it, from Mexico thanks. I am you mexican fan.
Hello Laura! Ive tried this recipe of yours & its soooo delicious. My family loves it! Thank you so much <3
What's the difference between using melted butter and butter at room temperature?
Thanks a ton Laura for the wonderful recipe!!!!!It was a big hit and was gone in no time :)

Can I use semi-sweet chocolate chip instead of milk chocolate chips?
me too but u can google the recipe, for example google "chocolate chip muffins laura vitale" and it'll be the first or second link.. its easier than to go to her website and look for it
google
i substituted sour cream with 3/4 cup buttermilk plus 1/3 cup butter. let's just say it looked  and tasted quite buttery. it was delicious though. my brothers finished them. thanks for the recipe!
What can I replace the sour cream with
Where you get all the ingredients and  utensils?
Make a blueberry muffin
can I not add cinnamon (because cinnamon is very hard to find here orz)? and can I use baking soda instead of baking powder?
I think I'm going to have to bake these for my birthday! This video didn't stop or blur on my iPad...that's a definite sign!
I made them yestarday and they were unbeliable good! seriously! best ever!
muffins are dense, while cup cakes are light in texture :)

These are AMAZING.
Your blueberry muffins rocked so I'm going to bake these as soon I get my hands on some chocolate chips!

Pause 0:46
I am the baker in my family, but this morning my sister wanted to try out a recipe and she tried this one... They turned out AMAZING! So proud:) great recipe again laura!
My only issue was that they were greasy,on the bottom
I just made these and my family loved them!! Thanks for the recipe :)
What about buttermilk? Do you think I can use it to replace both the milk and the sour cream dose?
sour cream? hmmmm
Hi Laura, I really enjoy your recipe videos almost everyday. I have a question, is it possible to replace sour cream for heavy cream or whipping cream? Because I can't eat sour cream.
No, you don't taste it. It's just to moisten the mixture. A good substitute is Yogurt or like she said buttermilk. :) Have Fun!
Do you taste the sour cream? I'm not a fan of sour cream so I don't want to taste it.
You said that you answer questions you don't answer any questions at all just saying
I used granulated sugar instead of brown sugar and it still tastes soooo delicious.
I'm gonna try this out but I need to get a few ingredients! Looks yummy!! :D thanks for the recipe, I've been looking for a simple recipe and this one is very helpful!
hi, Laura, i just want to know, what if I didnt use brown sugar in this recipe, and I just use granulated sugar? thank you.
I used plain yogurt and turned out as good as it looked
I love your work Laura I'm so excited to try this thank you for making my life easier in baking.
Can you make Vanilla pound cake please

Looks yummy! How to make butter milk though?
Are there any substitutes for sour cream
At the beginning she looks like shes talking to the corn
yes u do
Do we have to have brown sugar??
can you please write recipe in grams? :(
Why not , I bake myself all the time
Mix Milk and Vinegar let it sit in a cup or bowl for 5 mins.
Hi Laura  I baked mine for 18 mins and they came out perfect! Soft , moist and yummy to the core. Thanks for the great recipe !
could you please give the mesurements to the ingrediants?
YES I MIND! lol jk they looked perfect
do u HAVE to use brown sugar, or is normal white sugar okay?
mix in about a tablespoon of vinegar for a cup of milk =]
would it be just as good with semi sweet chocolate?
the cupcakes have a cake texture and need only a frosting, while the muffins have a more dense texture like bread and are filled with chocolate chips, blueberries etc...
u can substitute it with yogurt and a little bit of baking soda
Laura how can i make buttermilk? Please answer
This is an old video
She probably won't answer because she currently has 602 episodes already, this is the 90th.
Hi Laura!!! I Accidentally Bought Baking Soda instead of baking powder!!! Can I do this without baking powder or can I do it with baking soda?
wish i could make them cant cook them until next year
i love to make like this cupcakes i am just 11 years old  but i love to make it
Oohhh i always love laura's recipes. Easy to handle..i made this twice already. Soooo gooodddd!
I think you should be on master chief!

Lol 5:50
can we dont use melted butter?
Do a cookie dough ice cream recipe plz
Can you please do a Creamy Cookie Dough Ice Cream ?
because the flour sticks to the mixture
I'm not desperate for likes, I want to see whether there are other people in the world who can– well, bake by themselves.
The flour acts quite like glue: it sticks the chips to the dough, so they don't "slip" to the bottom.
Bit desperate for likes aren't you?
I DO MIND IF YOU TAKE A BITE!!!
hai laura u always pretty,  nice receipt seem is delicious, but how wonder do u ve this receipt measure with  gram not cup, tq so much. bcz i dnt ve measure in cup?? can u give me the receipt in gram.
She winked like 10 times at the end hehe(;
I didn't have any sour cream in my kitchen while making these, so I substituted it with Heavy Whipping cream instead. They are SO moist and good. Thanks for the idea, Laura! I will definitely make them again :D
You have a squeaky voice lol
Love this recipe, you're great ;)
Laura, do you have any recipes using pomegranate? If so, can you show us :)! thank you!
perhaps try the 3/4 cup of buttermilk she did in the red velvet cupcake recipe; I'd be careful and just put little by little until it comes down to the right batter consistency so you don't drown your batter
You probably could use buttermilk to substitute for both the milk and sour cream; I'm following this logic from the red velvet cupcake recipe in which the main wet ingredient was the buttermilk.
The flourcoated chocolate chips "grip" onto the surrounding batter which in turn prevents it from sinking all the way to the bottom - but you have to be really careful when you fold it in, if you mix too much the flour will just get blend in with the batter and that defeats the purpose of coating the chips in the first place.
just made them and they are so yummy! my granddaughter just finished one while it is still hot...thanks for this nice recipe :)
I made them they were amazing! But please please do a triple chocolate muffin video!
Im 12 and I love baking got inspired by Cake Boss :D Im into cooking also but mostly baking

i made these last week, and they tasted sooo goood :D
You dont say hawmoch you put in
Laura I trust your recipe for sure! I tried your red velvet cupcakes and its freaking awesome gonna try this too!
Use plain yogurt instead. It works perfectly and it is healtier ;)
Can we use semi  sweet chocolate chips?also pse clear for me what is the major difference between Cupcakes and Muffins apart frm the frosting?
She says it in the video. It's there just to enhance other flavours but you can leave it out if you want to.
Can i not use cinnamon?or can i substitute it with something else?
Does it make a difference if I don't use cinnamon ?
check her website its in the description,.
this recipe is very simple

Love itt c;

I HAVE THE SAME EXACT MEASURING CUPSS!!!!!!
I was wondering if I could sub whole milk for skim milk and some of the butter for Greek yogurt?? Would this work? If so how much? Please answer ASAP!
i used yogurt too. the taste still fine
i think you can
it is... i did it once, overmix it with my hand....
Thanks Laura ! I used vegetable oil instead of melter butter and I didn't get giant chocolate chips in my store so I used regular Cadbury chocolates ( I broke them into pieces) .as u said nothing like the sour cream and cinnamon ! Love it!
I just made these and they came out awesome ! Me and my brother love them ! :)
How does coating the chocolate chips with the flour prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the muffins?

Does it matter if we use canola or baking spray to prevent the batter from sticking to the pan when it puffs over?
can we not use sour cream in this recipe?
Just made these....SOOO GOOD!!
Nice (:
Check out my 'how to make muffins' video! :D

i think so, you'd probably jst have to use lowfat ingredients
Hey can u make lowfat muffins?
hey :) i live in sg too.  u can find it at tampines 1 :)

It might be baking powder issue, if you put in too much or too little, it can make them not rise properly.
Do u NEED sour cream?
theres sour cream at the supermarket dairy department..maybe u can check it out!!
1 question: can I use buttermilk instead of sour cream? I live in Singapore and I can't find slur cream. :( Please help!

Does anybody know where to buy cannoli shells in Huber Heights Ohio?
can this be a cupcake too
nope that isn't the case, sweets are become solid for two reasons: to much flour (maybe he/she added more than in the original) or the dough was mixed to much creating gluten that resembles bread.
Yep, I think it was that
You might have put them on the wrong rack...
Laura i love ur recipes..... im gona try this ... dis weekend for sure
wow! your're like the queen of cooking!! i really wanted to make this at school in cooking but we have the stupid recipie in the book :( grrr
youre a genius
i made these, and they were super yummy ^^
nah it's a new oven and quite good, my cupcakes grow very beautiful, but it's ok, I think the muffins turned out alright but we are not used to the texture, it's a preference thing
Your oven is probably quite old or bad quality - mine is, and my cooking time is always much shorter than in people's instructions :) You might have over-mixed as well, so be careful with that :)
Love the recipe and your eyes :B
Yes you can :)
Could I be able to use semi sweet chocolate chips?? Please I want to make these, bit I only have semi sweet chocolate chips
like mạnh
I tried this SOOOOO YUMMY thank you Laura ^^  but i think i put too much brown sugar or cinnamon xDDD they looked a bit more brown then yours, Please i will really appreciate if you give us measures in grams ^^

I am going to try it for my son for the first time. home made one not out of box :)
'' do you mind if i take a bite?''  Yes, I actually do
i can't be waiting to make it
No, you can't! The sour cream is just there to keep everything moist and fluffy... and for the muffins to not dry out! :)
haha, always :D
why r u always in a hurry??..huh
how much butter nd chocolate chip in grams?:) thanks
A muffin uses less sugar and flower, I think?
i tried these and they were too hard almost like rubber :/
@kitkatismyfave2 Well in her blueberry muffin recipe, she say sour cream is to help the muffin become so moist. And for the vanilla extract, you have to put them. Hope it helps!!!
when i made these i added to much cine amen
do u hav 2 add da sour cream?
Do I have to put in the sour cream?
a muffin is a lot bigger than a cupcake, and usually does not have icing/buttercream, whereas cupcakes do.
whats the difference between a muffin and a cupcake??
ALL THAT FLOUR!??!?!?!!
Is sour cream necessary or not?
Have You Ever Thought Of "Cupcake Wars"
lol I wasn't doubting that ;)
I got a question, somehow what I can't find sour cream in our town, the only thing I found is sour cream and onion, its it the same?
YES DEFINITELY!!
I did this, it didn't work, trust me
can we substitute the ice cream scooper cuz i don't have one but i still want the same measurements when filling the muffin liners...Reply thanx
I just made these and they are really good. The only thing I might do differently next time is cut back on the chocolate chips. I am a big chocolate fan, but these were super chocolatey.
Hi Laura i just made these on friday. they come out great just want to thank you 4 the recipe..
"the flower" ;)
Oh your so beautiful and I just love the way you talk,, I wasn't focusing on what your doing.. Ahahahahahahha how I wish you were my sister.. :D

Yum i love muffins!
Pleease dont tell me you are serious
i made these and the texture was really odd...not fluffy and moist like yours; mine were rubbery.  What did i do wrong?

one cup is 8 ounces
Hi Laura, can you please tell me how big your cookie scoop is? Is it 2 table spoons, I would like to know before I go buy one on Tuesday. Thanks!
What happens if we don't add the sour cream?
@Georgeyboi135 humity plays a very big factor in baking.
Why do you have to eat it infront of everyones face? Making me hungry. Lol
LOL she accidentally overmixed them a littlee .
I just made these today....THEY WERE AMAZING
Why so many laura vitale in here???
hi guys im laura vitale!!! and in this episode of laurainthekitchen

omg you should make onion rings.. :)
if you don't have sour cream, you can substitute it with the equivalent amount of yogurt + a tiny amount of baking soda :D
im hungry
Ive tried this recipe at home and i loved it, i could really taste the chocolate because of the cinnamon :)
you convinced me - super delicious! Just got them out of the oven, and to celebrate them I made an extra good cup of coffee. Thank you very much, greetings from Alemania.
Wow, cool!! Like the muffins a lot... Thanks for the videos
mine have a little. i doesnt matter! As long as they dont taste gross!
I just made them and my family LOVED them! My grandfather and mother are taking some to work tomorrow! If you make mini ones,you'll get left over batter for 6 regular sized muffins. VERY TASTY!
<3
Hi Laura,  I made these muffins and they were awesome,however my muffins didn't have a nice golden colour on the top even though they were well cooked for 18 minutes at 400 degrees,what can I do to get a nice golden brown colour on the top(the bottom had a nice colour though).  Thanks
i just made these and theyre AWESOME!!! thank u laura
She said you can!
Can I leave out the sour cream and cinnamon?:)

OMG. I just made these and I have baked a lot, these cupcakes are soooooo good. Divine. Thank you Laura for this amazing recipie. :)
how much buttermilk would you use to substitute for the sour cream?
I made these and they were great. My husband baught salted butter so I decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp. My daughter likes them better then Tim's
wierd q but how did you get tht pikn subscriber banner there? plz respond
Cupcakes are rather moist, Muffins are more like cake? I guess.
Anyone can tell me what is the measurement of the ingredients used as i can't find it on her website!! Thank you!
i think muffins don't have and frosting and cupcakes have frosting
Is it okay if u dont have brown sugar?
This sounds delicious. I'll have to try it out. I'd love to make danishes. They're hard to find now-a-days.
Just made them! They are perfect!!
TORTURE TORTURE TOOOORTUURRRRRRRRE!!!!! IM SOOO HUNGRYYY
Hers is in fahrenheit. Yours is probably in Celsius. You can google to see whats in Celsius from fahrenheit.
Fahrenheit?!
Wait can u use vegetable oil instead of butter
Just made this and it was soo good
It should be fahrenheit
can someone tellme if its 400 degree Celsius or 400 degree Fahrenheit ?please!!
I read in a book that cupcakes are the more delicate version of muffins, because of the decoration, the toppings, the fillings... hope it helped ;)
i made it for my family and they loved it so much, thank you for sharing. Do i just double the quantity if i planned to make more. can i also use this receipe by adding cocoa powder to make a all chocolate flavour muffin.
Hi guys! I'm Laura Vitale andonthisepisodeoflaurainthekitchen
They look so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!'n
A muffin is an ugly cupcake. Hahahahaha jk. They're basically the same but cupcakes have frosting (obviously) and cupcakes are softer and are posed as to have like a sweeter dessert kinda taste lol.
And I'm back to cooking videos... Why do I do this to myself?!
The difference is muffins are puffed up and have fillings like chocolate chip, or blueberry in them. Cupcakes are flatter and have cream on top. The ice cream scoop sizes are different too. The muffin is a #16, the cupcake is a #20 which is smaller.
I baked this, they looked so gorgeous! They tasty so moist! ;) wow!
Muffins are ugly cupcakes.
rainbow ice cream!!!
First time baking... Turns out surprisly great! Thk u so much....
a muffin is a ugly cupcake.
one has icing and one has like bery's or choco-chips or flavoring or something in them
a muffin is puffed up and a cupcake is a flat. A Muffin batter is also more lumpy and a cupcake batter is smooth.   It's a structure thing. A cupcake has the structure of a real 'cake' and a muffin has got more of a 'bread'-texture.
I thought it was that muffins don't have icing...
All you have to do, is put in the muffins Skittles.
SUB TP ME AND YOU GET 5 SUBSCRIBERS !!!!! SUB NOW FOR 5 MORE SUBS TO YOUR CHANNEL
if cupcakes have topping and muffins dont what if we put toppings on muffins will that make it a cupcake?
Cupcakes have frosting, muffins dont. :)
Muffins don't have toppings!
wow!!great recipe but i couldn't ctch everything.naybe you would wanna type out some of the stuff to but and the directions^^ thanks:)
Hi...Ummmm Can I use self raising flour instead of all purpose flour and baking powder?
can u make ratatoullie i think thats how u spel it........
if i use buttermilk how much am i suppose to use.?
Question!!                If I made these with no chocolate chips, for just a muffin, could I skip the cinnamon?! Thanks :)
at around 2 40 - 2 45 she says she uses either butter milk or sour cream
what?????
When you opened that one muffin, my stomach went "Grrrrrrrr!"
can i use self raising flour instead
11 people dont like chocolate chip muffins XD
Tiny bit? How big are your bites?
muffins are cake like texture and cupcakes are more moist texture
you are so friendly ~~~
yes she she said Sour Cream OR Butter Milk!
How big is the ice cream scoop?
She says you can over at 2:40
laura, what is the difference between a muffin and a cupcake?
I made this recipe and they turned out kinda gross and they don't look as good as yours :(
I made these muffins for my husband to take to work for a training. There were about 15 people so I tripled the recipe. By 9:30 am all the muffins were gone. They were a big hit. I felt like a pro. I was gonna post a video of me eating one, but I didn't. They were really good!
my muffins dont get like that :(
RAINBOW CUPCAKE! Thumbs up if you guys want!
I just made these and oh my gosh! they're the best muffins i ever made!
I just made these and they are delicious!
O.O now i want a muffin >.<
@TheYanagomez She says you can use buttermilk.. 2:40
I Love Your Food :'(
Omg these are so so good! Thank you :D
SO. GOOD.
@TheYanagomez she said you can use either
how much of each item!!??
I made them yesterday! delicious!
awsome!! sooooo delicious!
you make that ice cream scoop look so fun to use. i have to go buy one now. and make these muffins. omg
@TheYanagomez Lol, she said in the video that you can use buttercream. :)
@nonki212 That is incorrect. Go to her website, click on Recipes, and there's a (view all) button next to the Popular Recipes, click that and then hit Ctrl+F and type in the recipe name or Episode number and click on it. It will show the video on the top, but if you scroll down, you'll see the ingredients and steps.
@TheYanagomez yup! she said you can
can i make the muffins without sourcream?
@TheYanagomez yes, you can
I am a newbie in baking, I wanna ask is it I don't need to turn on my oven to bake the cake? I mean, I don't need to turn on the oven when baking after preheat it?
Im so gonna make this on my boyfriends bday :)
This is the best chocolate chip muffins recipe ever. When I first saw this video, I decided to try them and make some, and you were right, they are SUCH A HIT. The sour cream and the cinnamon do make them taste phenomenal :) Keep up the good work Laura!

"u mind if i take a bite?" YES :(
why don't you use baking soda in this recipe?
can we use butter milk instead of sour cream ?

4:40 if i were to try spraying that i probably would of sprayed the actually muffin batter along with the tin O_O
gonna make these for me and my man some day :D
They look like chocolate chip cookies from the top. Lol.
@kayla5287 it adds a lot of texture, but you can substitute with Greek yogurt, which worked perfectly for me.
i made these once at a friend's house, and they came out SO nice! they are super simple, and yet super super good, i really don't get how something so easy can be so delicious. <3

Would be nice if u actually told people amounts of things that you are putting in. Pretty useless without that
@cutepolish512 it is supposed to be runny (melted) when you mix it with the other ingredients but if you bake them and it is runny then you put less flower or more butter.

Could I use vegetable oil instead of melted butter? Thanks for your help in advance (:

Thanks Laura for the recipe. Mines are in the process of baking! The only probably is..... I melted the butter and forgot it in the microwave = ( lol so lets see how they turned out. but I know I will DEF need to bake another batch!! = )
@hughesy4027 you have to go to her website for the measurements... she mentioned it on the video :)
hey just one quick question hope you don't mind!! the sour cream that you mentioned, if i'm gonna do a 2 tier cake should i use the same amount of sour cream?

Can we replace cinnamon ?

Hey Laura, I was wondering if you could please do something for us health freaks. Maybe you can whip up something with high protein and low fat but as tasty as all of your dishes.

can i skip the sour cream?
my mouth is so wattery yum yum
i did this recipe and the cakes turned out really good thanks laura xxx
Can i use regular or powdered sugar instead of the brown sugar ? Please answer !! :)
wow
Suggestion. I've noticed when I make muffins, that once you mix the ingredients and put them in the muffin tin, it's best to leave the tin with the batter in the fridge for 30 minutes or until the batter is chilled. This makes the muffins spring up more when you add the tin to the preheated oven. Enjoy....
Are you Italian? (Sei Italiana?) I am an American living in Rome, and I make pastries. These videos of yours are very helpful. :-)
@kozarolap Buttermilk
@ino454 if you leave out the vanilla it isnt that big of a deal. Honey or syrup might change the consistacy
why does my end result never look as good as yours :'( haha.... could you just come to the UK next time and make it for me?
I don't have a pure vanilla extract, can I use a pancake syrup or honey instead?
what if I don't have a cinnamon?
I love all your episodes!!!yR(you rock)
what can i use instead of sour cream?
I made these today! Ahh, so good! :D
5:46 - Laura: "You mind if i take a bite?" Me: YES Laura: Takes bite.  Me: DANG!
can you use powdered milk?
I finally made them today and they are soooo delicious!!!! The only difference is that I used baking soda instead of baking powder and I used 9oz of chocolate chips instead of 12oz. THANK YOU for the recipe!!! You are awesome!!
you are really good at cooking you should make a show on tv
1 12oz of chocolate chips?? hmmm am not sure  what is that suppose to mean??

laura can we not use brown sugar if we don't want to because i 'm alergic
When I made these today i made a mistake! even though I watched this video so many times usually ur baking vids have just room tempature butter so i had a stick of butter laying and when i mixed everything together and i tasted it and it tasted weird so i was like uh and i looked and i forgot the butter! so i just added it in and it had like chunks of butter but i just went with it then when i put it in the oven i loked at the recipe and it said melted butter. But they were good anyway.!
could i melt maybe cup of chocolate chps and add it to the batter to mke double chocolate muffins?

THE MOST AMAZING MUFFINS IN THE WORLD! I'm making these for the second tie in one week! The sour cream made such a difference than any muffins I've ever made-these are great!
can i skip the sour cream?
Can you use a crushed bar of chocolate instead of chocolate chips? You can't find them where I live :/

I love you lauren!! they were super yummy
So I made these today and they were absolutely delicious! Hmmm, yummm. Thanks again for sharing this with us; I will probably make these numerous times. :)

Can we use plain yogurt instead of the sour cream?
Please answer! Can you substitute sour cream with cottage cheese?
@supergirlmanon absolutley! i would raccomend just 2 tablespoons or so and using unsweetened cocoa powder. Add a little more sugar as well because the cocoa powder is bitter if you use the unsweetened kind.
Can I put some cacaopowder (sorry if it's the wrong word) in the batter for extra EXTRA chocolate? Or don't you recommend doing that?
Can we use 2% milk
love ur show ....
@scanonic thanks, i eat everything in moderation and i also workout 4 to 5 days a week for about an hour and a half each day. :)
