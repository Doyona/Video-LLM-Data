You always pick the BEST recipes!  This looks like perfection with the avocado :-). Thanks for sharing
10 min, i left
Yummy 😋 😊
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Looks amazingly big and delicious roll.However, sauce could been made authentic way rather than using PB.
How do you get them to not be sticky after being rolled
It's too big...but thanks for your recipe😅😅😮😮
Largest Summer Roll I have EVER seen. 😆
Great presentation, you are fun to follow !
You answered a quetion that I have had for the last 15 years that I have been making these!  That is "damp paper towels" to keep them soft!  Thank you!!
Was very nice to visit your house, thank you for sharing your recipe with us
Thank you for alk the great tips.
Your husband is just like mine! lol   I can't wait to try these.  Need to go to the market. Thank you!
You need to learn how to peel a shrimp. Hint tear the legs off peel the main shell off in one piece then pinch the tail and pull.  Also poking through the avocado skin to get the pit out doesnt work for me. One, its just silly and two after dinner I like to have a smoke. I only have one cigarette a day and its after dinner. The avocado half shell is a perfect throw away ashtray.
Yum!!!
😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
Thank you, these look delicious and healthy. You make it look very easy, I can’t wait to try them . 😊
En Chile sacamos el cuesco con una cuchara y la palta también 😅 usar un cuchillo y pelar es engorroso
I have tried to roll 100s of these, and for some reason, I cannot roll them tight, no matter what I have tried. I am successful at all foods, people love it, I am a certified chef as well. But I cannot get them to roll right, LOLOLOL. I think maybe I do not fill them enough? Sighhhhhh
❤ definitely gonna try
She made burrito spring rolls 😂
YaY!! I'm going to teach the kids in my Kids Can Cook Classes The Avocado TRICK:))
I've wanting to prep these summer rolls the night before to bring to work for tomorrow's lunch.  What do you suggest in storing them so they don't stick together and get destroyed from unwrapping them?  I noticed that you used a damp  paper towel to keep them moistened....Is that the secret in storing them in tact?  I've used plastic wrap, aluminum foil, and parchment paper but as I unravel them to get to the summer roll, it sticks too much to the covering that the roll gets exposed and destroyed trying to unwrap it, especially when they're as big of a roll as yours with all the fillings.  Any secret suggestions if I"m packing like 3 in my lunch bag?
I think you can use sweet chili sauce also as a dip.
Going to have these for lunch today… a little less noodles and 2 extra rolls 😋 yum!!!
Save some of the noodle water for the dipping sauce
I love your video❤ you are amazing
VERY RELAXING WATCHING YOU BOTH EATING...
Luv it & sweeeet. Ty. I’m going to keep coming back for more . This the best spring roll video. I use, spring mix as well . Yummmmmilicious! 💃🏽💃🏽😂💝👍👍✌️✌️✌️😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
❤❤thanks for sharing,  will be making this very soon
Looks so fresh, healthy and delicious.  I'm  buying an advocado tomorrow to make these yummy bites. Thank you!!
So excited I just found you!
Hello from Mississippi! New subscriber
There is so much you can do with that.
Yummy so good food and healthy. Thanks ❤🎉
How come you don’t plunge the noodles in the shrimp water?
What other dipping sauces can be used peanut not for me
Ở VIệt Nam thì không có cho bơ vào. Gỏi cuốn quan trọng nhất là nước chấm phải ngon.
Plz! I want ur recipe for peanut dipping sauce.  It's very good! This video doesn't have it.
I love the EAT in the background.. Aight mam ...I'mma go eat
Thats looks yummy .. I want to make  summer roll too.Could you please tell me what kind of sauce or dipping for this? Thanks
id say thats an average size cucumber thats not chubby  3:46
I love your vibe
Really enjoyed watching you make these.  I would like to know, can these be prepared the night before going away?  I don’t think I’ll have time next morning.
Love that color, going to paint my beach house that color
interesting. I only put my rice paper in water for about 8 to 10 seconds.   and while I'm filling it, it softens. by the time I'm ready to roll the paper is perfect, not gooey, not to weak.
Thanks for sharing
The Vietnamese restaurant I use to always go to had these for 2 for 8 dollars which is horrible cause they use to be cheaper so I went and made them myself with your Ingredients and came out perfect. Didn't have the greens though. Just cucumber and avocado. Then saaw on the rice paper package they have the recipe as well so I'm just so happy I got to eat what I've been dying for for like ever. I'm waiting on my pork ribs to finish being made. I feel like a real chef that.
This looks delicious.  Thanks, Julie.  I've just subscribed.
That was so impressive thxs
💚💚💚
never use the microwave it's pure destruction of all nutrients in all food
Excellent video
I wonder if these will keep in the fridge. I would love to make these the night before and then take them to work with me for lunch the next day.
The avocado trick is genius lol I hate slapping my knife onto the pit too so I will definitely be doing this instead
Looks soooooo yummy!!
hello chef Julie yoon can you give me the complete recipe that is that white and for the sauce that you also use please I want to cook that so 😋
Love the vibe.  Please invite me next time. 🧡
Very very nice and so healthy! That’s a decent dinner , not just a snack. Has veggies, greens herbs and protein, what more can you ask for !
That’s a burrito size. Too much noodle wtf lol
Super delicious and healthy rolls👍👍👍
Looks very yummy...and it is always good with fresh grated ginger, have you tried this?  Thanks for the great video :-)
Looks like 3 shrimp in a sleeping bag. 😂😂😂.  Great video and tutorial. I luv these summer rolls. So many different ingredients you can add. I made one with seaweed salad and sauteed sliced Shiitake mushrooms and sauteed baby Asparagus. Happy summer rolling. 😊
I have subscribed. 😋👍🧡
Looks great.
I’m making this tomorrow afternoon ☺️
Yummy.  I love making these. Thanks 😊
Excited to make these. Yay.
I always wonder....who's filming?
Great, thank you so much
OMG!!! You made look so easy 🥹🤩
想吃100條
yummmmy!!! THANK YOU!! LUVIT!!!
love this video looks great can't wait to try.
This is the best tutorial I watched so far
For moisturizing the rice paper, really do not overdo it... as other people have said, just a fast dip will be more than enough. It should still hold its shape when you're taking it out. The magic will happen while you're putting the ingredients in. The rice paper will soften on your plate, before your eyes. It's actually one of my favorite parts of summer roll making
Thank you for this easy recipe Julie. I make it all the time.  Is it possible to sub the sriracha for chili garlic sauce for more heat?
You too are adorable!
Beautiful hands... Scrumptious food, great combo
I’m learning whit you👌
Hahaha you call those fat, u should see mine, girl, they're OBESE  xDD! Talk about greedy xD. I just finished them, these are stickyyyyy maaan 😬, but worth it!   Marvelous idea with the avocado, no other video recipe I watched included them, they're not traditional perhaps but for my yummy avocado-loving belly they're supreme! Thanks a ton!
Good trick on removing the pit from the avacado. Much safer that way.
Looks so good!
A lite spring roll ,shrimp avie sounds wonderful 😋
I love this recipe!
Hahahaha.. your NB husband is so happy .. Love it.💕
How long can you keep them in the fridge before serving my guests?
I'm looking for some fun recipes for the summer here in Aus and this just ticked all the boxes. Thank you. Do you have any other recommendations for summer friendly meals?
Recipe tin?
Niccceeeee
Will try
You can start eating....*side eye*   LOL
Thank you for sharing! I stumbled across your Chanel today and I’m so glad I did!
If you're making summer roll dipping sauce, it's hoisin and peanut butter. We would never use soy sauce...
look so yummy 😋 thanks 🙏🏼 for sharing
I notice some chefs cook the shrimp in flavored water with onion and ginger. Is there a reason you don't do this? Thanks!
big and sloppy smh lol
Beautiful job!  Thanks for sharing!
Oh my gosh, this is just so wrong. This is Vietnamese famous rolls and NOBODY MAKES THE DIPPING SAUCE WITH SOYA SAUCE UNLESS IT IS A VEGAN VERSION. Sorry lady, I have to give you a thumb down for that reason 👎🏼🤨
Learned some new tricks tonight at 2 in the morning.  I used to roll once instead of three times and i would cut my fingers taking the pit out of the avocados Fruit Ninja Style.  Now I'm Going to salivate in my dreams.  Looks so YUMMY!!!
I made these tonight for my family and everybody loved them! I need to practice my rolling and next time we’ll do more avocado and less mint, but they came out so great for my first try! Thanks so much for sharing :)
You are so good
Good I want try special the sauce.
Question.... Can I add some soy sauce to the water to wet my rice paper? (Perhaps to give it a bit of flavor) Or not recommended?
I love this! I will be making this.
I must try
Yum!!
Nice way to remove seed from avocado !
why do chefs turn their recipes into a movie. Don't care about your house being painted etc. I just want the recipe in the minimum time please.
Yummy! Good health
Looks yummy
Hi Julie! I watched this video again and I just love watching you cook! Gonna make these! 🥰
Those are BIG!❤️❤️❤️
Loved it thank you 🙏🏻🌹🥰❤️ am gone try making it soon just need to buy ingredients 👌🏼😋😋
Great 👍 but
That sauce needs some Hoison sauce in it....
Is that "all I would need"?  lol
I loved your videos I need to try it I try making but the rice was hard for me but on the 2 time I will get better thank for showing us love it
713k views??!!! 🤯🤯🤩
Thank you for sharing 🌹🌹🌹🌹👏👏👏👏👏
What can I do instead of the noodles??? PLS HELPPPP
Excellent video!
These were delicious !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I soaked my rice papers for 5 mins because they were too sticky for my taste. Thx for this recipe!
I have all the ingredients to make this. Keep them on hand at all times. We love ours with shrimp and/or beef sautéed with hoisin, oyster sauce and Maggie sauce with a couple teaspoonsof sugar, garlic, onion. I've never used avocado though. Looks great. Just a tip, just dunk the rice paper in warm water. Put it on your surface while still plastic feeling. It will soften as you're adding the ingredients. It will be easier to roll if the paper isn't too flimsy
So mine always burst. I would like to make the night before and taken to work for lunch and some of my co workers but I can’t them to not stock together or dry out by then. Too bad.
Thank you,yummy yummy 🤤.
Thus is gonna taste like nothing, but looks cute 👍
Chef Julie thanks for your wonderful and refreshing presentation, you have inspired my wife to get those needed ingredients to make this version of the Summer Roll.  I am subscribing!  John from Arnprior, Ontario
*my goodness I never ever thought to take the seed out of the avacado like that I’m here everyday hacking it with a big knife 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ THANK YOU so much for the tip girl that’s amazing!! Sending love from Toronto Canada* 🇨🇦💙💙
This was excellent, I can’t wait to try!

I love the versatility of this delicious dish.  I like the avocado substitution.  Add whatever veggies, meat, or tofu that you have on hand.  Thank you!
I love your spring roll twist😍👍
elevation worship
Thanks so much for this AMAZING recipe!!💕💓👍🏼
My spring rolls ripped and teared after stacking them on the plate with the wet towel...
How can I pack this for lunch? Like a way they won’t stick to the container or get dry.
❤️❤️❤️
It looked so good and healthy.
I like your cucumber. Looks like a weird watermelon
No hoisin on the sauce?
Ditch that sugar👍
thats a whole ass burrito
Your video looked so good, I'm absolutely going to make your recipe. Thank you CC
This was so helpful!!! Thank you so much! About to run to the grocery store to get all my ingredients and start cooking! :)
It's been very hot in London and I came across this video, yummy. Rushed straight to my local supermarket, guess what? Am eating it right now. Thanks and you got a thumbs up from me.
Just Beatiful!
I can't find the vermicelli noodle!
well presented video !! thanks will give these a go
I've always felt like they needed avocado, you just made it so.  Looks delish!
All you need is:goes on to list 14 ingredient 😄
Wonderful recipe. Can't wait to make it.
Great Sushi roll!! looks delicious! 😋
My kind of cooking! Lol
Do they need to be eaten right away? Am I able to make them in advance for a whole week days for my lunch at work?
Peanut butter will be sugarfree right?
So yummy and easy to make.
He forgot to say No Homo 8:35
These look delicious!!! Can't wait to make them!
I watched your video twice and loved it. You made seem so simple I will make some tomorrow!  Thank you for SHARING!  I hit like and subscribed to see more of your cooking tips..
Wonderful demonstration, clear directions and encouraging tips.  Well done!  I've bookmarked so I can get here quickly this summer.
Hello 👋 love ❤️ hope to see you soon my friend
I don't know why, but i have to dip my rice paper for a second because after i dip it, it starts to get ReaLlY sticky after a while. Even if at first it seams still hard 😂 but i at least learned from my mistakes.
Made a huge batch of these for my family, they all loved them (except for my brother, but he's 8 lol). Thank you for this recipe!! :D
Shopping list done!!! I did not include Cilantro. For the life of me I can't eat it. I am glad I found your channel filled with wonderful recipes. Most importantly, the ingredients are fresh!!!
This is such a good recipe!  Great tip with the avocado pit
I love these... they look super good. 😀😀 I will definitely try making them.
I Will try this but substitute noodles by lettuce
Wonderful, I’m salivating! You make rolling the rice paper look so easy. Mine stretched here and tore there...
Husband very happy😋😎
I’m Viet and I’ve never seen such a chubby roll! lol looks pretty !
Way too much water for the wrap! Too much filling.. I’m Vietnamese so I can see this came from someone that just read how to... also that big of a wrap will not fit in a person mouth!! I’m surprise that wrap didn’t fall apart. Maybe one with more gluten in it?
😋😋😋❤❤❤
Amazing video.  I will try this
its a nice recipe... you might want to remove the seeds of cucumber to remove excess water though and put some fish sauce and vinegar to the water where you dip your rice wrapper
such a great presentation Ms. Julie.  I made with TOFU instead of Shrimp and it came out delicious, thank you showing how to perfectly wrap the roll, you are awesome!  And yes, avocado was a great addition to the roll, never thought of that, so a BIG thank you.
wow just found you where are you from Tiawan
Turn on the AC???
Julie thanks, I've always been intimidated by how hard the process was and you made it soooooo super eas.  Love this and it looks amazingly healthy!!!
I love it 👌🏼🤤🤤🤤🤤❤️
Love his reaction and smile! must be so good.Thanks for sharing
Cut that green fruit into quarters and the pit falls out on its own...  Sushi chef technique for ya
I absolutely loved this video! Can’t wait to try these 😛👌🏻
I just bought the ingredients for them. I have never made them but have enjoyed them so decided to try it.  I watched your delightful video and I now will give it a try......Thank you
Great job Julie!!  I will try tonight! Thanks.....
They looks so good and yummy. I wonder what the calorie is?
These look fabulous (sans cilantro ☺️)!
wow so nice and easy! thank you Julie
Lucky husband. lol
I LOVE LOVE LOVE SHRIMP SUMMER ROLLS!!!! Sooooooooooooooooooo DELISH
Do you thaw the shrimp first?
Ah a new way to de seed avocado!   I like the look of that sauce - have those noodles already although i wont put in as much as you!  Lol  Thanks
Yummmm. Im.making mine  now. Jumbo shrimp. And I spiced up the noodles...
I like my peanut sauce garlicky
You should put letter first! And you leave the rice paper too long in water !!
Yum
So good, I try so delicious , thank you 🙏
Excellent!
The best
Making these tomorrow thanks !
😋
Wow so cool & snapy
I got here googling spring rolls recipes and ended up in your video. I'm under quarantine as many others around the world and I felt like preparing something fresh. I followed your peanut dipping sauce and my mom loved it!! Thanks for sharing your recipe 💛🦐 Stay healthy!!!
I love your videos ! Your nails are super cute in this video

Hoisin sauce
You are beautiful 🌷 Yours summer roll too 🌯🌶
You have no idea what you are doing
great tip with the damp paper towels!
I wanna try this at home, too. thanks for the video
That looks really good.  I personally would cut the amount of noodles at least in half because I limit my carbs.  Other than that though, very healthy, filling, and yummy looking.   Thanks for sharing.
ok...now i'm hungry !!!
很愛吃
That's my dinner tonight

Thank you 😊 going to make it 👍
I can't wait to make these.
Lovely video. Can't wait to try.
Thank you  my friend great sharing my dear friend.
Hello Chef Julie, I have attempted using the rice wraps... But why does it stick to the other rolls. Do you think I'm soaking them to long?
Good instructions!
Great Avocado 🥑 tip
Making these right now! Thanks!
Wow! With minimal cooking time and oil use, the rolls looked absolutely healthy, fresh and delicious.

Years later and I still love your video! Always come back! Thank you for sharing!
Hi Chef Julie, you're spring rolls looked amazingly delicious,  I make them alot for myself all year round, but I don't like the peanut sauce, but I must say you're recipe looked better, I made it and loved it. New Subbie.  Rosebud 👧🏽🥀🤗
I love your video  I always loved my salad rolls but my wife  being stubborn about carbs was  like a stick in thick peanut cold peanut sauce . I used this video to give ,me an alternative to eating salads and I took the salad rolls by the horns  and switched to cooking more Thai food . The reason why I did this is because I was diabetic 2 and my A1C was 11.2 I needed to drop at least 5 points fast so I cut out carbs and mostly the things I like  to eat which if I was honest was sugar . So I loved the peanut sauce but I used  coconut milk instead of soy because I still like sweet and I ate more salad rolls and more Thai food but smaller  portions . I stop taking my meds for diabetes  one month into it because I had a side effect I called LBS ... [ leaky bowel syndrome]  not a good whey to live an active life even tho I'm 62 yrs old. . I find being creative in your health adds to life and cooking has always been important to me and has help me when I was a river guide to give my clients something good but maybe different  and always ended up with high praise and satisfied customers. The side effect is that it always started a conversation. Any way I drop 5 points  in 2 and a half months  to 6.4 and my Doc was amazed  I did this  without the Meds. I can witness this because I was the victim of bad health and I was the solution to my health so salad rolls were a big part of changing my diet because I took control of my creativity and sald rolls were a big part of that . So There is another reason to make salad rolls . God Bless you I'm subscribing to your channel now Thank you so much for bring your cooking skills to youtube ... LOVE YOU
or malaysia lol
where you from Singapore or ?
She is scary with that knife!!!
My quest to duplicate this excellent spring roll recipe has been fraught many twists and turns.  My grocer told me that in 1995 an unfortunate outbreak of e.coli & Salmonella was traced to fresh bean sprouts, resulting in many supermarket chains deciding to remove this item from their  shelves. I just received a bag of mung beans from Amazon so wish me luck! I was able to find everything else needed and with the excellent video as my resource what could go wrong........right! Discovered that I was born without the burrito rolling gene, but I was born with the cannoli rolling gene. Hey, what if a few shrimp escape from the ends; push them back into the mix. I do not intend to give up, though; I will turn my cannoli roll into a burrito style spring roll yet.
Love spring rolls, delicious
Looks yummy and I will make it tomorrow.
u kidding me 😱 this recipe is wonderful omg  - thank you so very much yummmmm yummmmm- I'm making these DEFINITELY
That’s a lot of noodles yo!
You forgot the crushed peanut topping! Thanks for the info!
The sauce doesn’t look good at all.
Soo i'm alergic to peanuts but i feel their taste is essential to this recipe, what can i use? Thank you!
Can I use chicken? ☺️🤗
omg, that spring roll is huge! Haha
I love it 😍 thanks for sharing
Wow!!! Delicious!!! Im from El Salvador, and I am going to prepare this for my family 😊😊😊😊😊😊
Cómo preparar masa de para marquezote
Wow lol burrito size
Can I make these the night before a party and the rice paper will be ok?
I just subscribed now and i enjoyed your video.
Thank you.. How do i preserved it soft while lets say  im on an out of town get away?
Wow, glad I came here. I learned a new trick to take the seed out 🙂
You could buy shrimp already cooked, too. Then there's no cooking involved and you don't risk overcooking the shrimp. I can't wait to try these rolls. Thanks, Chef Julie!
Hey, Chef Julie... I'm so glad I found this cause my mom has been asking me to make them for her. Only thing is the amount of noodles you use. I mean, its a lot of noodles, but it looks really super good! Mom and I will try a "skinnier" version of these very, very soon!! Thank you for posting!! Take care....
And now I'm hungry 😭
That's not a roll, that's a fricken noodle, shrimp and Avacado burrito. Damn.
Thank you for sharing. They look amazing.
I love summer rolls. I substitute the noodles for chopped carrots.
So huge but need to try this 😍
Monster roll. But looks so yummy. 😋
Soooooo gonna make this....I'm lucky in the fact that I have an awesome China town in my city....Philadelphia, and alot of Asian markets.
looks dellish
My rice paper was a little sticky
Mmmmmmm look so refreshing will be making these. Thanks for sharing :) :) :)  New subbie :)
Thank You for the great avocado stone tip!!!  That is the best (happy sigh).   Its the little things :)
Looks great!  Do you find that some rice paper has a chemical taste?  How can that taste be removed?  I tried different brands and still notice it.
I use Hoisin sauce with the peanut butter.  I think it flavors it better than soy sauce.
yameeeeee .. ok .. i will make to........
Why I always have the same problem. They put soooo stinky  and  i can't take  them off from  the plate!! Help meeeeeee
Y'all are too cute😂 his first reaction after biting it I was like😭😭😭 I want that feeling😂😂😂
Thanks 🙏
I'm making this tomorrow for my friends! Thank you! 🌻
I have most of the ingredients already. I'm so making this TODAY.   LOVE your kitchen. Its funny because Im about to paint mines & have the "EAT PLANTS" letters to put up. LOL  (Great minds think alike)😁🏆  First time viewer & I'm SUBSCRIBING  THANKS A MILLION DOLL🌸
Just a tip for anybody, but you don't need to soak your rice paper. If you just dip them in water just enough to get them wet but its still hard, by the time you finish assembling all of your stuff and start to wrap, the rice paper will already be nice and soft.
Too much vermicelli noodles 😬 too fatty chubby spring rolls hahaha
love it
See, *this* is a spring roll!!
I just found your channel and this looks so simple and delicious. I definitely subbed! Happy cooking! 😊
Can I LIKE more than once? Satisfied and subscribed. So versatile. Thanking you.
Omg trying this NOW
Are those extra large rice paper ??
Deli!!! Omg..so the sause should give all the salt and tanginess to the cooked saltles noodles and saltless shrimp
This looks awesome. I see how the 'burrito' got huge.  And the rice paper stretched. I want to make it soon!
Has anyone made spring rolls with imitation crab? It would be even less cooking to do but I'm not sure if it would taste okay.
Editing is on point. Looks like a television show.
This is such a great video and your kitchen is really cool!
I have to try this! I have the rice paper , avocado, lettuce, sciracha, noodles,peanut butter, tamari, lime! What am I waiting for? Oh yes...shrimp and cucumber. How did that happen?! I love your way of presenting instructions.
Can't wait to make these rolls!
I want to try these with white rice instead of noodles, I feel like it would taste good too.
I have to try this like tomorrow looks super  delicious 😋😋😋
Love this idea!!! Thanks so much for sharing!!!
Love
I learned two lessons based on my mistakes. 1)DO NOT USE natural peanut butter 2) USE VERY THIN vermicelli noodles :-/.
That look so good. I love spring rolls that is my fav summer roll to get from the store. Are you able to use ahi tuna?
Those rolls are huge you can’t even fit that in your mouth
Thank you for such a great recipe!!  LOVE!  My guests loved them too!
I need a recipe for dipping sauce please
Love the recipe and your presentation.thank you
I absolutely love this, the whole time I was concerned that I wasn’t going to be able to make this but you made it seem so easy to make. I’m going to make this tonight, Thank you for making this video!
any suggestions for the sauce substitution if we don't eat peanut butter?
It looks so healthy I love this
I've made these before (not this particular recipe) but I have made them using green leaf lettuce, spring onion, cucumber, carrot, avocado, cilantro and of course peanut sauce (but I bought it from the store, and tbh it was so dense in flavor I didn't put a lot of sauce on the roll just because it was so over whelming to use a lot) but it is super refreshing and so freaking filling. Just make sure if you have never eaten cilantro before like with the stem and all in such large quantities, you watch or experiment with how much you use in one of the rolls. First time I made these, I put a huge amount of cilantro and it was so strong it was all you could taste, which really ruined the roll for me, but luckily on my second roll I used a lot less and the flavor was there but no where near over powering. These are super good for you and totally healthy. It leaves you feeling fresh, clean, full but also light. So feel free to eat these all the time with no regrets!
I’ve been eating these like crazy from a restaurant nearby, you’re tutorial was great!! Now I can definitely eat these everyday!! Thank you!
Looks so delicious!! Im gonna make it
The rolls are a lil too big, aren't they ?
Thank you!
Summer roll 🌯 lol... damn, I'm craving some now
Looks so delicious!!! 😋
So sweet 😍 Yummy 😋 recipe
Can we keep in the fridge for tomorrow breakfast ? Thanks
Could you substitute almond butter for peanut butter? I had to go Paleo after being diagnosed with Celiac disease and legumes are now a big no no.
saracha & peanut butter........I cant
love it! deff need to try that!
Too much noodle for me. You guys are cute
Thank you so much for this recipe.... this is something the kids and I can do together over the weekend....... we’ll add some sliced grilled chicken to it. 😀
Omg!! Looks Delicious. Thank you for sharing ❤️❤️
The roll is wayyy too big and not tight enough, so when you take the first bite everything falling out lol.
Looks soooo yummy and yes refreshing! Can’t wait to get outta work to make this!!!
You are Awesome Girl!!
Great!!  Thanks for sharing!
I'm a chef, italian and i love to cook fusion recipes, i loved your simple recipe. Thank you for this video, you really moved me. You are so sweet and i could touch the love between you too. Thank you for your job!
Thanks for the avocado seed removal tip...genius!
YUM
It looks yummy! I am looking forward to making a few of them for dinner tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing.
this looks heavenly. although i have to say won't it be easier if you just chop up all ingredients together in a bowl and then wrap them? i came here after watching this guy and felt it was much easier. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=impOpTBgBpM
Just found your channel. I'm grabbing my shoes and going to the store!
this looks amazing......does anyone know a substitute for the white sugar?
They look delicious! For some reason they reminded me to Plankton 😂
They look delicious ,  I can't wait to try them myself
Recipe looks very healthy and interesting. Would love to try. Any suggestion for steamed shrimp dumplings? Thank you.
So glad I found your recipe.  We just made them and DELICIOUS!
Looks fantastic!
Thank you have been craving these ever since I had my first in Santa Cruz ca .
Yum
The dipping sauce was so good
Thanks a lot Julie! You remind me of my sister she loves cooking and trying new ideas in the kitchen as do I :-) I’m Vietnamese and will definitely give this a try! I’m sooo excited!!! are you from the west coast? Or Hawaii, maybe?
Very nice..it’s pronounced Cilandro N
How can you make these and save for later without having them stick to each other?
Perfect!

Looks refreshing and colorful
Thank you! I just discovered Spring rolls and love them!  I am a vegan, so I just left off the shrimp...  and it was still yummy!
Thanks for the recipe.  I bought rice wraps recently and other rice products to experiment with. Now I know how to prepare them.
Looks Amazing!!!!!!
Wow 😉
Chef Julie, I'm a new subber and I love this recipe.  I'll definitely give this one a try, minus the large quantity of noodles. :)  Regardless, a well executed recipe. :)
I feel the same about the typical knife technique - not a fan. Another avocado pit trick I saw recently: after you cut around the pit, make one more cut to quarter the avocado - you expose more of the pit so you can just remove with your hand. So simple and innovative!
So yummy. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe.
Thanks looks so delicious and yummy will do this thankyou 😀
Oh the face of your hubby when he took the first bite! He looks cute. Love the recipe, so easy to follow
I like that you put more noodles to make it feel like a meal instead of a snack. It will keep me full longer. I can’t wait to try.
Enjoyed!
Looks delish,  thanks for sharing.
i always dip for just 3-5 seconds and double up on rice paper to mitigate the effect of tears
well now I am super hungry! ;)
I'm allergic to peanuts , do you recommend another dipping sauce ?
Hello, I subscribed to your FOOD channel, please SUBSCRIBE to mine...Thank You!
How long to soak the rice paper? Is't soak to boiling water or just in warm water?
Good video i will give it a try thanks
YUMMMMMMM......
You're a great teacher. Can't wait to try.  I love spring rolls and with shrimp not pork.  You guys are too cute.
JUST SPRING ROLLS NOT SUMMER ROLLS GOSH
Beautiful recipe!
oh what a horrible recipe...too much talking, ack.

Love this recipe 😊thank you!
I need the printable recipe for shrimp/avocado spring rolls.  Went to the site and it was not there.  Help.
That looks so yummy, reminds me of Bien Hoa and a happy memory.
tasty.  making tonight thanks
Way too much noodles
Such a nicely edited video.You made a beautifully. But, I wanted to see the finished painting. Well Done!
I learned so much from this video (the avocado trick) and it looks fantastic can't wait to make some for me and my family
Thanks for this tips now I have an idea for my husband birthday . But before that I'll make it try first see if can make make it perfect
love your video :)
Too much noodle, lots of calories in them :(  Noodles are cheap and fill customers up at restaurant.
yum! definitely have to try making those
you should use round plate and put some water in it easy to roll :D Khmer style :D
I agree with the others , dip only a few seconds works great for me.  I add a lot of stuff too. whatever my 3 yr old wants and I found  started rolling by  folding  the two sides down  first work the best for me.  try that.  ;)
I love these, I think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread but I don't like bread so I eat rice. Thank you for sharing. <3
Good
Vietnamese burrito
the dedication and effort that goes into these videos is unbelievable! Love them!
Your place looks gorgeous! can't wait to make these! Thanks Hun!
I can't have cilantro, because it tastes like soap and metal to me. It's a genetic thing apparently.  Any substitutes??
Spring rolls?? Those are not rolls, they are loaves. LOL
Yummy!  The avocado seed removal is genius!!  I never have heard anyone do that until today.  Thank you for the recipe and thank your subscriber for the excellent tip!!
This was really fun to watch! I'm excited to try making it :) Thank you for sharing!
Wow huge springrolls but perfection lol
love it what could I use instead of the peanut sauce. we have nut allergy at home.
I soak them only for 5 seconds. I don't even soak it. I just dip it and take it out.
I tried them and they are delicious!!!!!!!!!
Great video!
The guy is really funny to watch-- he's so happy after 1 bite and his eyes lit up. Cute couple!
I just made these. Thank you
You are so sweet I want to say thanku I never thought of avocado slices in spring rolls I will definitely try this recipe and avocado seed trick too thats amazing!
Loved it.  You two are cute.  Thank you.
You said use water between Cold and Warm,.... is that Room Temperature then?
thank you SO much for sharing this!! and that avocado pit hack. genius.
Do i have to add soy sauce because i dont have any
nice!!
super like😊
I miss your cooking videos!! :)
I love this video. Your personality is so upbeat. However,  I tried making the rolls with both the small and large wraps, and although I don't believe I'm overstuffing them, they manage to burst after a while--- I've been practicing quite a bit for a few weeks; now I'm just getting frustrated. 😫
You put a little too much noodle ! The wrapper don't put too long in the water.I feel joyful to watch your shows.Thanks
love this stuff
definetely saving this recipe for the summer!! :D thanks for making this video!
thank you
your roll is too big, hard to eat.
best
omg cute couple <3
Your video editing is great (love the hand-lettered ingredient labels) and these look delicious!  Can't wait to try next week :)
This looks really yummy.....can't wait to try it. Thank you s much.
that's a DAMN BURRITO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
absolutely delicious! !!!! thanks
Made these yesterday as our first try at making spring rolls. We didn't have shrimp, so we used imitation crab. I cut the sriracha sauce amount to 1/4 of the recipe, but used sriracha mayo mixed with the crab. Our first rolls fell apart and needed to be double-wrapped! They started to look normal after the fourth or fifth one. They might have turned out ugly-looking, but they were very tasty.  We made enough for dinner yesterday and lunch today... Can't wait to make them again! Thank you for the simple, clear instructions. You made these on a scorching hot day, but they were just as good on a freezing day in Northern Wisconsin!
ur kitchen loacation is bad , base on fung shei, cause ur stove n sink face each other
Oh my goodness I'm definitely going to try this so easy and simple!! Thanks for sharing
I will make this recipe this week..thank you Chef Juilie
Do they need to be eaten straight away? Can they be prepared the night before for work lunch?
Is that an icook knife you're using?
cute husband
Why soak for 20 sec? In & immediate out has always worked well for my family and get soft after 60 seconds out of the water. Am I missing something?
Delicious
' yummuy love to eat rice paper rolling... goood tastey... rather 3 rice papers in a roll is better than 1 rice paper
when i make this spring rolls, i reduce the amount of carb-the noodles and i pump it up with greens..lots of greens! the wrapper is already about 110 cals itself.. also i clean those "GUTS" from the shrimp- they are nasty!
Great, simple and easy...will give this a try!
thank you im going to try this!!!! Can i use rice instead of noodles?
Great video, thanks a lot for sharing your skills with us :)
Thank you! I love spring rolls!
OMG I died when you but that much rice noodle in one roll 😂😂😂 we Vietnamese just put like 1/5 of that bunch of noodle you put in that roll, less noodle more vegie. But for those who don't like vegie, then it fine to put that much rice noodle and the protein (pork and shrimp).
Looks so delicious. Ima try it out your  way yumm . You put avocado . I love avocado. SUBED AND LIKED. Hope you find interest in checking out my Channel   . And subscribing . Thank you.
I'm hungry know 🙀
Vietnamese burrito.😛
So delicious
Yummm. Can't wait to try this out I love love love avocado! ❤️
looks delicious!
love your recipe so much. Just some tips from my experience :)) Those rice papers only needs a few seconds dipped in the water, take it out while it still firm, while you're wrapping, it'll be soft completely by asorbing all the excess water. And use less noodle for each wrapped, that's the ingredient made you feel full so fastly.
thank you Julie, that looks pretty yummie!
great video made me hungry
Omg I've never had anything like this and it looks soooo good!!
i'm in morocco i like this  bravo chef
it was DELICIOUS!!! and pretty easy w ingredients i could get at my local supermarket :)
Man those look so good!
thanks I loved this video
Such an awesome variation!
Delicious 😁 thanks
can i make it the night before and bring it for lunch box? how do i store it to keep it fresh? thanks
Tried this today and everything was so yummy! And the peanut dipping sauce was bomb! :D
Hi. My son is allergic to nuts, but he's great for shrimp and the rest ingredients. Is there any other sauce that I can do to dip the roll in? thanks!
I tried a similar summer roll few days before. It tastes not bad but the rice paper smellt so awfull and i didn't want to eat more of them. So can you tell me if there are "bad" rice paper wrappers?
and recipe for the dipping sauce?
I just read today that avocado contains a component which  helps to fight blood cancer (leukemia)
I cant wait to make these. TIP you can slide the avocado half down the side of a glass cup and it removes the peel very easily. how long will these stay good? Im making them to take to lunch at work and would like to make them a couple of days in advance.
I didn't see this question but wondering if there's a good way to make them in advance? Such as the day before.
you make it look so easy to prepare I am going good to make it tomorrow, thank you
I'm a meat eater, but this actually looks pretty good! I'm going to try it!!
cornstarch can be added to the dipping sauce, to thicken it up.
Can you let me know the calories for 3 shrimp halves, 2 cucumber stalks, cilantro, rice paper, spring mix, and avocado? Any nutritional information would be great; I'm assuming this information is already in your cookbook and is easily accesible, I'm very grateful for the recipe and don't mean to give you any extra work. Thanks!
This looks so good! I'm going to make these! Maybe no mint...lol. I can't wait to try the peanut sauce!!
Cool
Mine didn't come out as pretty, but girl, were they DELICIOUS.  That peanut sauce and all those different flavors!!  Yummmmm!!!!  Thanks for the keeper recipe!!
Just got all the ingredients, and the shrimp is defrosting for tomorrow!!
I made these yesterday and they were oh so delicious and the peanut sauce was perfect!
love this recipe
wooo these look really fun I don't know how fun it really it so make em but as long as these come in salty version I'm glad <3 I love these rice wrapper taste when it's already done I think it's perfect and much better for me than actual normal wrappers too :)
Can't wait to try these!  Mmmm!
Verry cool video!!! Now Im hungry
can you eat the white part
Looks good, but man...I dislike when springrolls are soo big. Lol.  People have their preferences (:
nice!!
It looks absolutely delicious ! I definitely have to try this now that it's getting warmer and warmer in here. Thank you :).
cilantro not my thing, nor mint in this and  lettuce not my thing.  But did this without  and fantastic.  Added some shredded carrot instead.  Basil might be ok for me.   Sauce was excellent.
Vietnamese peanut butter dipping sauce is usually thick :) but your receipt are good :)
you are sooo cutie!!! love when you and your hubby are munching away!! I made the spring rolls with avocado, and they were amazing!! thanks for the substitute because I had no pork only shrimp, but wow avocado really is soo much healthier!
thank you again!  so glad I found you, you have a lot of recipes I was looking for
Great instructional video. Can't wait to make this!
You still left the paper in too long.  And you overstuffed.  If you want to do this efficiently, do three at once--assembly line style.  It will make you fuss less and your movements will become efficient.
This might be a stupid question, but I'm thinking if making a batch of these for a week's worth of lunches. Would the avocado turn color and oxidize if I don't eat it right away but keep it in the fridge throughout the week?
Very nice recipe & your presentation is fun ... thank you :)
Too big hahaha
Just discovered your channel- Love the recipes and both your positive personalities 🤗
I am so gonna make this!
You don't have to soak the rice wrappers. Just dip it in and place it down and wait for a few seconds and it will moisten up.
Just found your channel. Love the spring rolls.  Looks like a good lunch! Will have to catch up on your other videos.
been looking for something like this for a while! thank you for the video... they look delish.
Oh MY God, it is perfect! I absolutely, will give a try! i feel so inspired right now, lol :D
What is your suggestion for a dipping sauce if you are allergic to nuts?
Last summer on a trip I bought those noodles and wraps (large & small wraps) and they haven't been used because I couldn't think what to do with them. Just found this video. Will get the veggies this week & try your recipe. Also have a jar of peanut sauce. As always, thank you for the recipes.
New subscriber!! I love it❤️❤️❤️
I am a new subscriber and I am super in love with your channel! Currently catching up with all the videos!
You're my new favorite chef:) This looks great and I will try it.
the wrap just need to be wet and it will soften by itself
yummy! can't wait to try this recipe. I'm not a good cook but your recipes make cooking fun and easy. Your my secret ratatouille chef in my cooking hat lol My family just thinks i'm the best cook and so creative ;) Thank you Julie!
yum! I will need to make this soon!
Is the sriracha a must for the sauce, any alternatives... ???
It looks amazing!! I always soak my rice paper wrapper way too long. It gets wrinkled and hard to straighten out like you said! I think I'll make it this weekend!
I just discovered your blog and these videos this morning. Can't wait  to make these as well as the salmon in rice paper this weekend. Excellent writing and beautiful videos!  Keep them coming.
We love spring rolls! Thanks for the recipe.
*drools* do you have any recipes that just use one pot? :D
These rolls are so cute!  I know it's a weird weird to describe food ;).  I'm definitely going to have to try this, but we will have to go substitutions.  Sunil is allergic to avocado, and I'm allergic to shrimp :(  Thanks for offering the substitutions!
I cooked  the lasagna  and the summer veggie  spaghetti. sooo good 😍😍 I love your recipes  Keep up the good  Work 😊😊😊😆😄
You always pick the BEST recipes!  This looks like perfection with the avocado :-). Thanks for sharing
Chef! i love Spring/Summer Rolls... This style to ! No to much into the deep fried ones Fresh and clean flavors is the way to go! =) The avocado trick tip! Thank! You!! And whoever left it in the comment section! Cheers!
i must put this on my wanna-eat-list!! The rice paper wrappers we can buy in Germany always have weird smell of plastic, have to put it into boiling water to remove the smell, and then the rolling step gets super messy, rice paper sticks together... And, I wish I could have some too-hot-to-think weather here...:(
Quite a take on the Vietnamese spring roll, Julie. I like how you make the peanut butter dipping sauce, a little different than how my family make it. Also, I love the avocado tips. And substituting avocado instead of pork is brilliant, since pork can take quite long to cook. Not ideal for hot summer days. Love this recipe!
That avocado tip is BRILLIANT!!! I've tried to make rice paper rolls before, but they kept tearing. Do you think I've been soaking them too long?
Thanks for the wonderful idea! Definitely craving these right now!
Oh I thought that was glass noodle >_< hahaha.... It's actually rice noodle we call it "Bihun" here pronounce it as bee-hoon. We normally use it in noodle soup or fried like how you would do a fried rice and sometimes even salad which we call kerabu bihun here. It wud be nice for the summer too since it's refreshing and light. I hate removing the pit of avocado too ! Omg now I know a different way to remove it now. Thanks to the one suggested that.
Beautiful graphics! The rolls look delicious.
