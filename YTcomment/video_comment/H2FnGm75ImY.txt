Love watching you, and learn new baking ideas.  As a mum, Thank you for never using horrible nasty language , like some do. ✝️📖🇬🇧❤️
What size is the apple pie mould/ dish?
Hi John, aside from your pie, i really like seeing your Foodprocessor going to work ;). Would you be so kind to give me a link to the product please? Much appreciated ;)!  Best regards form the highlands of Bavaria, Hawk
This looks delicious ❤ thanks John ❤
How many people could you serve with your apple pie? Valerie 😊
John I baked this today. It was absolutely beautiful I’ve got one very happy husband 😊 thank you for making me fall in love with cooking/baking again 😊
Yummy yummier yummiest 🎉
I love this channel so much and made some of them and still  doing. Everything is a big success  Thanks so much John. Appreciate you sharing to us!! All the way from South Africa
Hi John. Could freeze the apple after you add the spices, for a later date? Valerie
Se ve muy sabrosa
❤
What a joy to watch and listen to John, you have such a calming voice and made it look effortlessly easy!  I made my pastry by hand and am just assembling the pie now for our dessert tonight, my daughter can`t wait to taste it. Thank you.
It's very rare that you watch a video and at the end you have pretty much have the same as in the video that you have just watched but by heck Jon you smashed it again 👏 👍 your vids always deliver 🎩 xx
Some people add raisins or sultanas to apple pie while some people add other fruits such as blackberries, raspberries, blackcurrants or redcurrants etc.
I like extra thick double cream with apple pie.
Hi What size processor are you using,I used a one litre and its a bit to small (I did get away with it though)
I’ve a question. I do not have a food processor but do have a held hand mixer; can I use to make the pastry?
What is the size of the pie dish? Thanks
hi john going to have a go at this pie but can you freeze the pie🍏🍏
Hi John great channel,  do you do any recipes for airfryer as well ?I´d love to make a chicken pie crust pie using an airfryer is it posssible , cheers Paul from Austria
I am going to make your apple pie the weekend  xx
From So Cal , Santa Paula  I made apple pies with my dad growing up. Cherished memories!
I am so happy I have found you, clear spoken, slow paced chef. Thank you!
🙌🤗🥰
Lovely x
Great recipe. Bottom of my pie has gone soggy but I wonder if I didn’t drain the apples enough or thicken then mixture enough. Still very tasty though and next time mine will be better 😊
Thankyou for taking the time to share this recipe. I am going to have a go myself with no baking experience. For the pastry can you substitute the granulated sugar for the same brown sugar you are using? And also for the topping? Thankyou
I’m 76 and been having disastrous experiences of making pastry over the years, I found your recipe for this apple pie the other day and have just made it. It is in the oven as I type this message and smells wonderful! I had to add frozen fruit to make the right quantity of filling up and ended with far too much juice but apart from that this is the best pastry I have ever attempted to roll out usually it’s crumbling and very difficult, so thank you. I will be making the cheese and potato pie in the week for my grandchildren. My husband thinks I am after something ha ha! Also going to attempt your recipe for Roast Pork on Sunday! IAlso, going to purchase some items from your store now!  Sometimes insomnia pays off I found this on you tube when I couldn’t sleep the other night, thanks again!
Trying this now.  Fantastic video much appreciated  🍎 🥧 🧑‍🍳
this is amazing, the filling looks so good! i am going to try this. i made your crumble apple pie and it was delish.
Yours was the first video i watched when i decided to make apple pie and after watching countless others, i have to say yours is the best!  Thank you very much!
Looking for an apple pie video and found this one. Wow, it looked so good and your videos have very instructions. Warm apple pie and custard - without a doubt my all time favourite dessert 😛.
Hello there, could I put the filling in, and then add a layer of custard?
John, this looks incredible. I can’t wait to try it. My Nan made the best apple pie when I was a child, I only wish I had been old enough to think to ask for the recipe before she passed away. I will definitely be trying this tomorrow. Thank you. 🙏🏻  If I wanted to try making Jam tarts (you know the little individual jam/lemon curd ones), would this be a good pastry for that? I guess they’d need less baking time. Would I need to blind bake those? I can’t get them here and I miss them dearly. Another taste from my childhood. Finally (sorry for the inundation in questions) I’ll make the pastry by hand. Do I add the sugar before rubbing in the butter or after? Many, many thanks for everything. ❤
John let's assume that you live in the U.S.. What is the best type of apples to use for your recipe?
what is the size of the baking tray?
Great recipe and easy to follow.  The result was really good.  Having now retired I am starting to do more cooking and baking.  Incidentally, I had endless arguments with relatives who said I should use 'cooking apples', but many eating apples give great results.  I use Braeburns as Mr Kirkwood suggests.
A clear and precise video, exactly what I needed. Thank you 👍  I've never made a pie of any kind before, and I'm going to give it a try over the weekend
❤ 🍎
Superb!
Thanks for the spice tip. Will get that made. Apple 🍏 pie 🥧 looks scrumdiddlyumptious. Thank you 😊
You need to offer bibs in your shop John - I drool like an old codger* watching your videos. (*Oops, I am an old codger!).  Btw remembering my Nan's apple pies, she always blanched or par-boiled the apples to get a smoother filling. Most recipes I see don't do this anymore?  Fondest memories, coming in from the  garden, as a lad, and cutting a slim slice of cold apple pie, "to be going on with". Oh, damn I really need that bib mate!
Thank you for the beautiful recipe, I am Vietnamese and learning to make pie apple for my English husband - his favourite cake. 😊
THE BEST APPLE PIE
Yummy❤❤
hi John, nothing to do with cooking, but there's a narrow boat documentary on ch.4 and the narrator sounds exactly like you. Is it you using a different name?
Dear John. I have two questions: 1. For this apple pie, can I make the pastry used in your beef pie recipe? The one with butter melted in hot water? I simpy adore this pastry. I would love to use it for all my pies, be it sweet or savory.  2. Could you teach us how to make a raspberry pie in the future? 🙏 Sending hugs from Poland
'The best apple pie recipe you can ever find.
One little general question from a fan of your videos.   What is the actual advantage of doing it with cold butter and a mixer compared to room temperature butter, very gently with the fingers (not with a mixer), without forming gluten of course?  Thank you John for your fantastic videos.
thank you for the technique of thickened apple sugar spice sauce.
Just sent this to my friend in Bogota Colombia. 😊 She is watching your latest pancake 🥞 recipe. She has started to watch all the other videos John, she struggles with English but gets the jist of it. Mucho gracias señor John. Adiós. ❤😊
I thoroughly enjoy your videos. ❤
That looks amazing. Thanks John. I will be trying that this weekend 👍
Just put mine in the oven, I'm thrilled that I could make the pastry in the kitchen aid, never thought of that before, I only had self-raising flour so Let see how it goes, thank you :)
I've been using this recipe for years now, it's my absolute favourite and it never fails to disappoint! Thank you so much John for sharing your amazing recipes, we appreciate them. Merry Christmas to you and your family.
Hello John,a Blackpool girl here,living in Germany, got my apples in the fridge,will be making this later,again, it's lovely,thank you so much,a real taste of home, Lesley
I was taught to use egg wash on savoury pies. For fruit pies - brush with water and sprinkle castor sugar over it.
Hope it hasn't got a Soggy Bottom.?
It’s thanksgiving tomorrow and  Johns apple pie and sage and onion stuffing recipe comes out again. Keeping this tradition alive for the second year running. 😊. Thanks John.
Apple pie is my favorite dessert and this one looks so good!!
Hi, John, you made a beautiful apple pie and it was an easy process you gave very significant information about making apple pie thanks.
Could you use cooking apples instead of Braeburn apples?
Hi sir, for the cornstarch mixture can I heat it on stovetop instead of using the microwave?
John I’m having problems making the pastry lol I am about to try my third attempt if it doesn’t work I’m giving up I’ve already wasted so much ingredients lol I’m using a food processor just like you I put everything in following step by step but once I put the water in it does not go into a ball like yours mine is a wet consistency as if I’m about to make cupcakes lol any advice would be great thankyou x
MINES JUST GONE IN THE OVEN LOOKS GOOD TOO THANKS.
Me encanta!
Done.smells so good thnx for u
I've never made a apple pie before so searched youtube for ideas and your video came up and all I can say is WOW it was absolutely lovely and turned out to be 1 of the nicest apple pies I've ever had, I'm from County Durham I've subbed the channel and will be definitely trying more of your lovely recipes
very little sugar added.
best video I have seen yet on this topic.
Hi John apple filling was lovely but pastry wasn't a biscuit type more chewy than shortthink 40mls of water might be to much xx
Wow I like it! On my way! Thank you
Hello John! Baking this again as I write. Never fails and always a joy to use your recipe I am always grateful!
Just tried your apple pie recipe. It was so easy to follow and we have the most amazing apple pie. The heat here is 26 degrees (not in the UK) so was a little tricky with the pastry but it turned out with a nice crust and no soggy bottom - thank you!  Will have to try more of your recipes now 😄.
Love how detailed your instructions are. Thank you. New subscriber here!!
Got this in the oven as we speak John! If its as big a hit as your orange cake mate then this will be a regular! Many thanks .
I really enjoyed this video John. I feel that I can have a go and be pleased with the finished product too! Thanks. 👌
Hi John thanks for showing me your home made Apple pie 🥧 looks very delicious thanks David 🥧❤️🇬🇧👍
I absolutely loved how that apple pie came together so much so that I'm just about to give it a go now. My second go at homemade apple pie, last one (a different channel than yours) the filling was wonderful but done a different way, but the pastry 🤣 oh dear, I needed a hammer and chisel to get through it 🤣.. Doing it by hand so I'll have a look at your chicken pie pastry.. Cheers John 👍
Thanks for this, John! Very useful tidbit about turning the excess spicy juice into a nice thick apple sauce for the pie, that really boosted its flavour! I made a big one as a trial run and put a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon of cinnamon and (1/2) nutmeg, and it blew my head off...wasn't sure what I did wrong and then I double checked and felt very foolish, lol.  Used the recipe again to make eight mini apple pies using Scotch pie tins and this time I didn't overdose the filling with 3x the amount of spices and it was much better, it came out green instead of brown, much more aesthetically pleasing! Friends and family loved them.   Definitely going to be making my way through your videos, baking everything. Also, I have the same pie dish as you, I think. Tala, I think?  A couple of questions for you, if you don't mind! First, are the proofing caps reusable, and if so, how would you go about washing them? Second, what is the name of your cling film device I see you using in this video and others? I hate cling film with a passion but that makes it look so easy! Finally, now that the hot weather is rolling in, would you be interested in making a video or a short about knocking together a vinaigrette, like your mayonnaise one?   Thanks again! You're a national treasure indeed!
John Kirkwood. Is an absolute British legend. And you don't swear like Gordon Ramsey.  🍞🥮🧁🍳😏
Looks lovely, I love apple tarts. What is the difference between a pie and a tart. Pastry?
Cinnamon, sacrilege. I have rarely come across a pie that contains it in the UK. This is more an American ingredient.
Apple pie made today, again, just perfect. Being Dutch I was hesitant to make a 'different' kind of apple pie but came out beautifully.  Only criticism from the hubby was "too much cinnamon". But MY fault because I doubled up as that's what I do with my Dutch one. I will be a regular customer to your videos. There's Delia and you John, not found anyone else better over the years.
love your quite tone and simple delivery of the recipes with soft music in background.......WAAYYYYY to many YouTubers aspire to be "Performance artists Entertainers or Comedians" and I turn them off within the first 3 minutes.......but am sticking to your channel and appreciate your recipes :)
As an American, this is absolutely gorgeous. I would happily bring some wine over just for that pie :)  oh! And for your company, of course
traditional British food is amazing and extremely under valued. Thanks John for showing to the world how delicious it is.  An italian subscriber loving your videos!
Hi John! Lovely video, as always. Could we use your boiled water pie crust recipe for this as well (like in your pork pies)?
Just like Mother used to make..
Good to watch an expert.
I would do that as mini ones. That way the rest of family gets some. 🤣
John That's Amazing. Brilliant Channel, Many Thanks For Sharing.
I’ve thoroughly enjoyed making this apple pie recipe on a freezing cold winters afternoon, my husband is so glad I’ve found your channel, we’re both from Sunderland originally but moved  to the London area over thirty years ago. This feels like going home. Thank you so much xx
Hi John, can you use ready made short crust pastry instead  Many thanks  Paul
Vare nice video 👌👌
Winnie the Pooh?
Thank you! Great video.
do braeburn cook softer than granny smiths or bramley john ?? i,ve only used those last two types 😉  great video again .
Thank you very much
BEST accent ever with amazing recipes!  Reminds of my Grandmother and GrandPa.  Brings back childhood 🙂
Excellent recipe! Thank you 😊.  I just want to add your sweet voice is like Winnie the Pooh.
Im enjoying my pie So delicious! Thank you for posting your recipe.❤
Im making this recipe now will see how it comes out,my first time apple pie!
I’m planning to make my first apple pie and I found this video. As I’m listening to you talk I can’t help but think of Winnie The Pooh your voice reminds me of the movie 😅.
wife said this dude sounds like  pooh bear, cant unhear it. 😑
Yymmmmm
Lovely must try this soon great job
I love pies and making pies. And EVERY bottom crust is always soggy. I've tried every trick and hint I can find on the web.   Any advice for that problem?
Hi from Ireland 🇮🇪
Thanks for the video John. If I wanted to freeze this recipe at what stage would you suggest I do it?  My rolling pin with the spacers on is brilliant used it today to make your mince beef and onion pie.
I just love watching your videos. Good simple British food done well. I have an absolute ton of apples from my tree so pies and crumble are definitely on the cards
Seeing how you rolled the pastry, I knew you are a professional chef ✨️
Hi John...goner make this pie today using my neighbours apples from her garden...ive not made apple pies for yrs lol and have been craving it now ...i normally stew my apples first but goner try your way...thank you for sharing. Ive made a few of ur dishes and have come out perfect x
Thanks!
Just made it. Perfect👌
Hi John, if I want to do a peach pie instead of apple, how should I prep the peach? Anything I need to do differently than apples?
Do you have any recipes that call for honey, lots and lots of delicious honey? We all love hearing your voice. Cooking with poo bear 🤗
👌👌
Hi John! I want to use less sugar, is it ok if i cut the sugar from the pastry?
Here in the American south we always put three cuts in the top of the pie before baking. One for steam, one for flavor and one because that's the way granny always did it. I'm going to haft to try the custard topping. Thanks
Not sure of weight of 2 sticks of butter. Only know ounces and kilos. Longing to try your recipe.
Best presented
Hello John, your family and your friends are really lucky…! Thank you for your videos.
This looks amazing.
Saved this recipe to try it at home
Yummy! Another traditional English desert recipe. Surprised you didn’t use traditional English  Bramley cooking apples in this video. My mom made the most delicious rich, sweet shortcrust pastry. The tartness of the cooking apples, paired with the sweetness of the pastry and custard was delicious. It brings back lovely nostalgic memories of my mom backing.
Made today, great pie. Everyone liked. Will make again. Thanks.
Very tempting.
Hi John love the video recipes, you are easy to follow clear and concise. I have a question who makes the Gordon Ramsey food processor as I have one just purchased without dough blade (second hand) just wondering if you know of one that may fit.kind regards susan.
Nice calming music. This can be substituted with vegan ingredients and is JUST as delish 😋 😍
Just made this pie for the first time, have also made the lemon drizzle cake both look fantastic, I always use John’s bread recipes as well, love that he describes everything so easily, thanks John please keep the recipes coming.
I am about to tackle making your apple pie a custard today. Hopping it all works out as good as yours.
Can’t stop watching your videos John and the commentary is brilliant
Cracking video. Have subbed. Cheers!
Here we call it an apple cake or apple tart, am about to make it and will let you know how it goes, John.  Once again, thank you for the great easy to follow videos.
My great grandfather George Herbert Clark (1870-1964) used to say " Apple pie with out cheese is like a kiss without a squeeze".  Grandpa Clark  took over a cheese factory from his father Chauncey M Clark who started it right after he came home, from the American Civil war, in upstate New York ( Russell NY) .  They used to have  apple trees there  on the farm called Tolman Sweets.  Of course all the trees are now long gone
Is there anything John can't make? What a guy. Hooked on this channel. 🙌🏻
Hi John, your recipes are first class, i have made your steak & kidney pie  and it was very very nice, just one thing i would like to know,  what make is your prossesor.
This recipe is the dogs of Apply Pies!! Thanks John for sharing your knowledge with me!
I like the look of your pies John...I will be trying to cook a few soon
That looks fabulous.  Can't wait to make that vanilla custard either
Pls give a recipe of pie crust in oil
A real master
Won't this have an uncooked bottom because it wasn't blind baked?
Hi John could I use this pastry to make fruit mince pies or is it a different recipe I need, iv never made mice pies and I'd love to give it a go
Hi John. Can the sauce be thickened on the hob rather than in a microwave? Thank you for the recipe. 👍🏻
Thank-you John.  I love apple pie.  Hope your well.
Do you ever add a pear to “smooth” out the apples.
Hi John where can I get that pie dish from please
Hi thank you John, I’ve just come across your channel, You make it look so easy, I’m 68 and going to give this a try at the end of the day if it doesn’t work out I can put it in the bin and try again.
You not say What temperature heat oven????
Bloody lovely John!!! I made an apple pie the other day with nice warm (Proper Birds lol) custard, I didn’t put a lid on my pie but a nice crumble style topping, turned out lovely. I enjoy the pie either way, lid or crumble but absolutely must have custard haha Thank you very much for sharing your delicious beautiful recipes with us….it’s soooo. very appreciated. Looking forward to the next one, I’m not watching in order, just playing catch up lol.😂 💖~Tina~💖
This pie looks almost too beautiful to eat!
Winnie the Pooh? Is that you 😱
Thumb up john as usual 😍 I will try it
I made this apple pie today and it turned out perfectly. I particularly liked using the thickened juice with the butter to coat the apples..delicious with extra thick cream
Oh John, now that apple pie is definitely for my son.  He gets a apple pie and gets himself a soup spoon and eats the whole pie himself!  Lol  That’s how much he LOVES apple pie.  I thought I’d share that with you, silly, but some I guess love pie and I guess the rest get to watch.  Lol.  I’ll be busy baking your apple pie it has that different part with the left over juice from the apples draining.  I’m sure it’ll be right up my sons ally.  💯😊
Looks amazing. Thank you so much.
That thing looks perfect.  Gonna try this one.
This looks delicious! My grandma taught me how to make pies completely from scratch when I was a kid. They are so much better than store bought pies. Some things you said I know (such as using cold water for the pastry and lemon juice for the apples) but happily, I learned more neat tips and tricks, like rolling the crust back on to the rolling pin! I struggle to get my crust into the pie pan and on top of the filling because (as my grandma said) it's very rich. This will help me out tremendously. Thank you for the wonderful recipe and helpful tips!
My pie crust never was baked on the bottom so I now blind bake my crust before I put my apples in the pie, but the next time I make a apple pie I am going to use your recipe!!!!!!!!!! Just found your site!!!!!!!! love it!!!!!
I just made your delicious recipe and I got 10/10 off everyone. Thank you so much John and you get a 10/10 from me. Just deelicious.
Thank you very much. Delicious 😋
Thanks John, that looks Delicious
You are like Bob Ross in the kitchen 👍😉
Love it.  100%  gonna do it!
John, I've made several of your recipes, THANK YOU! However, i seem to be having issues with fruit pies coming out runny. What am i doing wrong? I followed your recipe and video exactly (using gala apples) and once again, the insides are quite soupy.
What can I say !!  I have just made this apple pie, and made the pastry in my processor, which I have never done ever before, and always its a challenge to get it the pastry to cook right, not be tough, or soggy or thick or too thin, it was always a dissapointment , many times just eating the pie filling and ditching the p[astry, BUT.. this time so easily done in the food processor just as shown in this video, and PERFECT PASTRY, that not only blends beautifully with the Apple filling as you eat it but is tender and delicate but strong enough to hold the filling, looks good tastes good, I shall NEVER go back to hand making pastry again, so easy  too... Thanks for the Tutorial...Pies here I come!!!
Good and clear explanation, thank you for the recipe, from Malaysia. Suddenly I felt like being a pastry chef.
Beautiful John now that’s a pie xx👍👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Hi  John, if I want to use a 11" pie dish, how would I adjust the recipe? Thanks
I made this for after our tea, I was going to send you a photo, but it has all gone, it was delicious, I will be using this Apple Pie recipe from now on. Thanks John.
Hi John!  Where can I find the apple pie follow up video for the homemade custard please? Thank you John
Hi John, I only use whole wheat flour in all my baking, can I substitute whole wheat flour one to one for all purpose flour? Thanks.
Made this recipe yesterday and it turned out great. I missed out the spices as  I prefer it without 👍🏻👍🏻
got to try this 1looks good, ive done the corn beef hash pie several times now while on furlough. Great food videos thank you
Thanks for this recipe John. Can you say how much sugar to add for a sweet shortcrust pastry please for a batch made with 340g of flour? Thank you for the videos, they are really inspiring. X
Thanks ever so much john for your wonderful recepie.  I followed you and everything  turned up Perfect. Fantastic
Hi John ❣️ I've just put the apple pie to cook in the oven. As I'm cleaning up, I'd like to know what to do with the leftover pastry? Wouldn't want to let it go to waste 😉
Hi John. Great recipe. I only have Bramleys. Would I need to increase the amount of sugar that I use?
Hi there John, can I ask where you purchased your pie tin from please? Thanks
Thanks very nice recepe 🤗
OK guys, this will be my first effort at baking in my 74 years !!!  I've not long retired and my wife reckons it's my turn now.  It's mid summer here in south western Australia but I want to be ready for winter.  It will bring back memories of living with my Gran in Middlesbrough, North East Yorkshire.
Hi John,  your videos are brilliant, such a help, thank you. Can I ask which food processor you use. They are expensive but due to recent poor hand function, I need to buy one, so I can keep making your lovely recipes.  Karen.
yummy apple pie.  I will try to make it
Thank you John for this recipe. It is an amazing, exquisite apple pie. I love it!!
Just made your pie. Thanku it’s perfect. Love it.  Thanku so much.
Thks..🤍
I want to jump through the screen and eat that pie. I made it, wife and kids wanted me to make another one next day.
What a gorgeous looking apple pie 🥧 😍😍
Thank you, John... Very nice recipe.  Just love it 😋
WOW now that's an apple pie like my GrandMa used to make!  Like the processor for making the pastry.
Excelente receta!😍desearia que fuera en español, saludos
Winnie the Pooh bakes Apple Pie!
Looks really yum, thanks
Ooooooh! John, it looks delicious.  I want to eat some right now.  Another great video and recipe for me to try 🍏🙂👍
Oooh, I never thought of pineapple juice! That would give it a great flavor as well. *i have a friend who sticks her processor, blade and all, into the fridge or freezer to keep cool when she makes pastry dough
Hello John, Love baking your goodies, wonderful. could you please tell me the brand name of the cling film cutter. Thank you  Kind regards Phil.
Hi John I have a problem I am making your delicious apple pie the problem I have is that the pastry is in the fridge and the forgotten sugar is on the worktop do I make it again l o l
I love your video because you have the voice of Winnie-the-Pooh...
We need the Custard recipe because this looks amazing xxx
This is the 2nd time I’ve tried to make this pie and both times it’s come out wrong apples are still solid not enough sauce. I’ve used apples from the tree and bought Rae burns from the shop. I don’t know what I did wrong.
just making this to your recipe cant wait to try it.cheers john.
Frandan  Love your videos and your voice nice and calm just what we need pie in the oven thanks.
Fabulous recipe,its delicious
Every video clip I've watched so far has been thoroughly created. I love the way you teach us all how to cook, the way you explain every cooking single step is clear and easy to understand. Just simply amazing! I have only found your channel on YouTube today but have spent the past hours watching your cooking videos. I am sure that I'll be making a few delicious dishes during this quiet time from work. Thank you for sharing your skills. ❤😍🥰
I have just made this Apple Pie for the 2nd time, a rainy day requires it , the recipe never fails
Thanks for the sharing of your fantastic recipes !!! From 🇦🇹 Austria
I love your pride and care, your simplicity, and mostly I love hearing you talk to us.  I find it very soothing and calming but a friend of mine said "It's like Winnie the Pooh talking to us." After hearing him say that, I thought, "He's right!" and Who doesn't love Winnie the Pooh?"
Your recipe looks very appealing and appetizing. For sure its very tasty and yummy! A must try dish. Happy meal soon. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
YUM. Your apple pie is the real deal. Plenty of apple. Delicious.😋
The best apple pie I have ever eaten!! My compliments to your teaching method. You're just Great. PS-- I worked  in Italy as a Chef for 28 years.
Thank you so much
Looks great and explained it better than other pie videos. Going to see if theres an alternative to corn flour as I've none in the cupboard.
Beautifully done. Enjoyed watching ur skills
👏
Approximately how thick do you roll out the pastry?
John, There seem to be wide differences of opinion about the type of pastry best suited to apple pie. Commercial apple pies around here (Queensland Australia) seem to be about 50:50 between sweet-short styles & the style you show here. Would you please consider maybe doing an alternative featuring sweet short?  Oh & thanks for the many videos you have so carefully put together.
I've never done an apple pie so this is my first attempt . . . but I don't have any corn starch! Oh nooo. That's lesson one, always read through the recipe properly (or video) Hopefully it won't be a total disaster, maybe just a bit of a soggy bottom! Thanks for such a nice channel! I find your instructions really easy to follow 😊
Thank you sir .
My mouth is watering, i have to try this Sunday for pudding.  🥰👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼❤️Thanks Sir xx
Hi John. Love your videos... especially your bread recipes. I've never had one fail, so thanks for that!  In your pastry recipe can I substitute lard for the butter?  Is there anything else I need to consider if I swap it out?  Thanks
Learning again allowing the juice to escape the apples keeps them from shrinking while cooking.   Here in the grocery store they sell round flat pieces of caramel in which to make Taffy Apples I wonder if I took the flat sheets of taffy & put it on top of the apples before the dough if it would come out okay.  That custard makes the pie over the top
Amazingly fantastic! Thanks again John. Your pie and pastry crusts are amazing.
Hi John. Hope you are well and avoiding the virus. Just to let you know that I tried this recipe today and is delicious. Have tried several like Hairy Bikers apple pie (which is still nice) but this one jumps out at me. Maybe it's to do with straining the juice from the apples, then adding additional butter (then cornflour) in jug in microwave, before putting back with apples. Either way, it added a new dimension for cooking apple pies. Thanks again John and take care ! Davy
Can always trust a Northerner to bring the comfort food!
Sounds like one I used to have and can't wait to try it. Thanks
Thanks so much John Kirkwood! For writing be back and telling about how l could get the recipe! 🇨🇦
Great job! Wow 🇨🇦
What a great video. Thanks for sharing 👍🏻
Wow! I love apple pie and it’s so delicious 😋. Thanks John for the recipe 👍
Absolutely ace! John, your skills at cooking are brilliant along with your easy to listen to voice.  I've been taken back to my childhood home watching your videos as I grew up with food like you cook. :)
another mouthwatering video fabtastic you are Number 1 in everything you make incredible this is
Thank you sir, I will use your way to thicken the juice before baking the pie, it’s really a good idea. Much appreciation ! Best regard from Tokyo!
Good video ! Thanks.
I love apple pie with custard or vanilla ice cream it's delicious
Really beautiful
Looks delicious will be trying this weekend.
John>Delia 😉
It's a great pity that you can't earn Michelin stars for your video's .⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
SWINE .... I've just drooled all down the front of my shirt
Hi John. Only took up cooking and baking when I retired. Your recipes have been an inspiration, good food just like my mum and Nan used to make. Thank you so much for the time and effort.
I might have a go at your spice mix. I have the same coffee grinder / spice grinder! x
I love the look of this John. When you say it was one of your customers favourites...what type of establishment did you work in as a Chef please? Curious x
mmmmm yummyyyy... technology needs to improve so you could click a button n wallah a slice of your pie comes through my phone n i get to try ...now that would be marvelous indeedy 😊😊
That has to be the best apple pie I've never tasted....yet!! I'm most certainly going to give this a try in my kitchen for the upcoming holidays!!! Thank you John :)
💛
Chef Kirkwood, when I make and Apple Pie, Ior anyother fruit pie, I melt some Apricot Preserve and paint the bottom to waterproof ithe uncooked past. I find that the addition of that element gives that bottom crust an extra favour kick after baking.
looks very nice, but could it be so sweet??
Utterly utterly!
Love watching your videos John, You make it look so easy going to bake your chocolate cake this week.Thank You John.
Hi John. Can you let me know the exactly the brand food processor your using in this video please?. Would like to order one.
I used to love coming home from school  and having that gorgeous aroma of homemade apple pie  greet me as I opened the door.. Loved my mums baking days.. ♥️🍰🥧🍪
Thanks John. This is my favourite pudding 💙👍
Hello there. Thank you for sharing. But on the profoodhomemade page the contents of the apple amount is written as 4 kg. if I hadn't seen this video, I'd cut 4 kg of apple :))) Love from Istanbul
Mmmmhhhh!😘
great work yammyyyyyy
Thanks for your excellent programs full of wonderful recipes, absolutely lovely apple tart and as its my favorite I will be making this one on Sunday!
🌼😉🌸
Hello   Can you make crema catalana please
I like to precook my apple mix to evaporate and thicken the filling, of coarse the mix is seasoned first....Hal
John, God bless you, I moved to the USA 26 years ago and I have longed for some good home made recipes. I run a facebook group called Brits abroad and 2 days ago someone posted your porkpie recipe. I have since been getting no housework at all done lol. I have already made the simple white sandwich bread and I am about to make this apple pie too. Thank you for sharing, you have truly given me a piece of home
I've made this a few times now and it's brilliant, thanks so much for all your work in these videos and sharing your tricks with us. I did have to chop the apples small and cook the pie for about an hour as the apples were still slightly crunchy if they were too big, I like the apples soft, delicious.
Delish!!
Hi john, thanks for this brilliant recipe and video. I have just made this and cannot wait for it to cool down to try. John i have tried a few of your recipes not and they are brilliant but i noticed you dont have one for custard tart which i love but never seem to get it right. Will you be doing one in the future (hope so)
It looks wonderful! Do you ever have a problem with a soggy bottom? ☺️
Another fantastic recipe, clearly explained and beautifully demonstrated!  May I ask whether your food processor is a professional model with more power than my Cuisinart home one, or are they all about the same?  Also I have gadget envy over your cling film dispenser,  I've never found one that works, lol.  Also, what brand is that pie plate, it looks non-stick but you wouldn't need to grease it that well nor would you cut it with metal if it was.  I have the old-fashioned enamel pie plates but they don't give you deep filling, and a Pyrex one that does, I just don't really like the way the Pastry cooks if it's not on metal.
A really great way with the filling there John!
I must say your recipes  are spot on , it's getting the time to make them all , I ll keep watching  thankyou
I’m so making this apple pie . The apple sauce and custard was the clincher for sure
John,  What material is your black pie dish made of?  You got me fired up to do some baking.
Amazing recipe. Will try this later.
This pie turned out great! It's been a long time since I attempted to make a pie crust; the results were always disappointing in the past. This pie crust was both thin and flaky--just how I like it!
I'm going to try to make this the moment I'm fully healed (just had a tooth extraction) ... I could try it now but then I wouldn't get to taste it and that's no fun now is it XD
I’ve made this today for our annual family cricket friendly. I followed it to the letter - even found some lard to grease the pie dish (not that easy in Australia). Grandma Heppell would be pleased!
what temperature do you set the oven at ? Thanks so much
You have the same kitchen worktops as me and I also have the same Pyrex jug and the same sieve too! I got my kitchen from B&Q, Black marble counter with white units around and black handles.  We have the same kitchen!
Cant wait to try your recipes once i’m done with my finals!
Ohh me encanta tus videos!! 🎈😍 porque no tengo un abuelo como tú 💖🙌🏻 Mi esposo y yo estamos enamorados de tus videos ya nos subscribimos 💖bendiciones 🎈💖👍🏻
Hi john just made The apple pie! WoW  my wife and my self have eaten just about all ,love it thank you Colin  and Rosemary Central Hawkes Bay NZ
John will the juice flow out of the fork holes in the bottom? Your techniques are so helpful. This will be my next John Kirkwood recipe I’m going to try. You haven’t let me down yet!
This pie has no calories... right?  Haha.  Gorgeous pie John.  The custard looks delicious.  Ice cream is a perfect substitute as well.
Just the best apple pie I have ever had. Thank you for such a good recipe and the video makes it so easy to follow. The butter and corn flour in the apple juice - just brilliant.
Love your videos, awesome and informative. Made an apple pie inspired by this video!!
👍
Thank you very much. Another excellent pie. I love Granny Smiths from my garden. Custard to top.
simple simple love love..john have you by any chance a bread and butter pudding recipe you can share ..these old school  recipes really do take me back to times past every mouthfull....you dont get that effect with any mcdee or kfc ppl binge on nowadays!!!
Hi John  new subbie.Loved that pie. Beautiful , SIMPLY Beautiful.
Thanks John! nice tip there on the apple liquid, :) awesome like always!! :)
Thank you so much for your recipe! I will definitely do it with your custard cream!
Made another apple pie of  your recipe,10 out of 10 John works every time Thanks John
Now i know where Tasty recipe is from🤔😊
Hi John .. I am from Iraq .. Is it possible to prepare the apple sauce on fire because i do not have a microwave .. Thank you
Another winner John, thanks mate. Baked this today and it was delicious.  Yours is my 'go to' channel now......so much good stuff. Cheers .
As always its a please watching your videos.  That pie looks delicious.
Mr Kirkwood, what a great recipe, hard to beat a good decadent apple pie
Dear John, thank you so much for another great recipe! Is the pie as good the next day as on the day it's made? I want to prepare it beforehand and treat our guests on Saturday, but not sure how it will survive. Thanks!
AMAZING!! Absolutely simple and well-instructed video to follow!!! Thank you so much!!! <3
can't wait to try this (and the custard!).  My favourite!!
I love apple pie, I will make this pie, thank you for such so wonderful recipes!
Making this today! It just came out of the oven, and it looks beautiful. I've been making apple pie for years and years, never tried making the cornstarch sauce and adding it back in with the apples. Can't wait to taste it!
There nothing better than the smell of a kitchen when you are baking an apple pie.
John that's the best. Delicious Apple Pie. Lovely voice to listen to.
John Kirkwood, I'm from Mexico, I like your videos, and the little bell always  give me an advice you are making a very good creation for all of us. I can't wait for the moment yo make your Apple pie...!!! Thank you, I'm following your channel.  :)
Positive you know this but leaving it here for other subscribers who might not know. Fun fact: The first written apple pie recipe goes back to 1381 in  England;  it was printed by Geoffrey Chaucer and included apples, figs, raisins, pears and a pastry shell (but no sugar).   Evidence of Dutch apple pies goes back to the 1600s. In addition to apples, Dutch pies include lemon and cinnamon and sometimes raisins and icing.   The tarte tatin, or French version of apple pie, was created by accident by hotel owner Stéphanie Tatin when she was trying to make a traditional apple pie in the 1880s.
Wow, looks fantastic! I’ve never had custard on pie before. Thanks
Wow! John, you make it look so easy. I haven't even thought of making apple pie because I don't think my sons would like the texture of cooked apples - but this really is an inspiration, particularly with the custard. I'm definitely going to try this, in due course. Oh heck, if they don't like it, it just means more for me! Many thanks!
Good one
Uh, where's the Ala moded John? (Vanillia Ice cream) 😉
John, this will be next on my list to try, regards Frank
Thanks John that was amazing. Your method for making the apple filling must be an English thing - I have never seen an Australian recipe do it that way  Apple pie is my project for this afternoon and I’ll be using Pink Lady apples. Yum.
Excellent 👍 demo & delicious 😊💕✌
I wish I was your nextdoor neighbour. I'd be round for taste tests Everytime. 👍👍👍.
I luv apple pie with custard. That luked yummy. Thanks for sharing John. 😊👍👍👌👌
Your pastry skills show you are a pro baker for sure.  Mastering a good crust is very difficult and I'm a pretty decent baker.
Pretty Perfect Pie John. Yums Up!
Now that is what you call apple pie, can't wait to make this John, and it looks delicious Thank you, for sharing this one :-))
Hello John, this loooooooks so good.
Thanks John. It looks fantastic 👌
I caught myself actually sniffing when the pie was taken out of the oven..WOW !
This is my favourite pie . Thanks so much for sharing John
Another excellent video.  I always gain a lot from watching the techniques you use. I have always used Bramley apples for apple pie but next time I make one I will try Braeburns and also draining and thickening the juice that runs off them. I don't have a food processor and am avoiding having yet another gadget and so I make pastry by hand.  I hands are rather warm which is far from ideal for pastry and so what I have bought and found useful is a handtool called a pastry blender (Lakeland, ebay etc) which is like a knuckle duster and allows for the incorporation of the flour and fat quickly without the fat melting by body heat.  I used your link back to the chicken pie recipe for the pastry part and like you I use half lard for savoury pastry and find that comes out well and is far more economical
Excellent Apple Pie! Apple is my favorite so I am always looking at more ways to try. I cant wait until you post the custard, that looks awesome! Also, could you please do a pound cake, another favorite and I am sure you have a brilliant recipe for, thanks, truly enjoy your videos.
Geez John.... you’re blowin my New Years diet all to bits.  Amazing as always my friend.  Keep the videos coming
Looks lovely, John. I've been experimenting with making custard pie (trying to recreate those I could buy in the cakeshops of my childhood). A bit tricky to stop the custard separating on baking (keep the temperature down) but, oh, so worthwhile!
Remind me of my mum letting me help in the kitchen on sundays. She taught me how to trim pastry with a knife holding and flipping the plate around on my fingers letting the excess drape over my arm. Happy days warm apple pie and evap 😍👍
Oh yum John, thanks very much, I think I'll  have apple pie  today
Thank you for a wonderful video and all your helpful hints to make it so delicious!! 🙏🏻☺️
Lovely apple pie.  Is this the traditional British apple pie?
Fantastic. Thanks John for you efforts and delicious recipes
Dear John My daughter is fascinated with your video and she remembers your name. . Thanks for your recipes
Thanks John, I can almost smell and taste the pie. B.t.w. I love the Wrapmaster 1000 I’ve bought after your advice. It works like a dream. Peter
Apple pie.  My favorite. My wife makes the best apple pie I have tried.  Fantastic video
Okay I am ready to have a very large slice of your apple pie and I will take 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream! YUM! My Mom taught me to crimp the edge as you do.
I like apples that are tart and are not hard. We used to have tree like a gravestein apple. Its hard to find those anymore.What other apple would you suggest. I don't like granny smith.
My mouth dropped open when you brought in the egg and vanilla custard!!!  What, What??  Now for sure I'll be making that pie but not until that custard video :)
Thanks John. I'll try to remember this in 9 months time when my apple trees are ready to harvest.
Wow sedapnya
Another great video and a terrific recipe. Thank you!!
THANK YOU!
Lovely! I was just thinking last night that i would make an apple pie coz there's just too many apples  left from our new year's celebration haha and when i woke up this morning whoah ! Notif squad here lol thanks again John. You're really an angel in disguise. I'd say it again, you are the most genuine, passionate and authentic teacher I have found on YT. I always enjoy your recipes & i have them saved to a folder here for easy browsing :) Thanks again.. I am definitely baking this today!..from halfway around the world.
Oh now in need some pie lol
John, I thoroughly enjoy all of your videos and every recipe of yours I've tried has been fantastic.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipes, your experiences, and your time with us.
Another excellent video! Thank you for these great videos to help the rest of us learn from your experience. Cheers from Alberta Canada!
Love the butter crust. Shortening is nasty.
Another great video I cant wait to try this one, the idea of using the apple juice mixed with butter is brilliant. You are without a doubt the best chef on Youtube, all your recipes actually work and the the ingredient quantities and ratios are absolutely spot on. My family are all putting on weight as I keep making these wonderful meals. Many thanks for all your good work Mike
Gosh. This looks super delicious. I’m always on the lookout for a good recipe that I can add to my occasional baking. I’ll give this a try. Do the apples retain a little bit of crunch?  Thank you for sharing.
This looks jolly wonderful John, nothing like home made pastry, bet your kitchen smells yummy all of the time lol! Thanks again for another great recipe and demo. x
I've been making apple pie for well over 50 years, since I was a kid! I love apple pie and can't wait to give this recipe a try!...looks delicious, especially with that custard topping! Thanks again John!
That looks absolutely delicious, John. I love your idea of thickening the juices from the RAW apples. I would never have thought of that. Will definitely give that a go. I adore homemade custard from eggs, but haven't done it for ages.
Hi John,. Nice one good and deep  custard looks good too, All the Best Brian 🤗
Thanks John, Another top video
On my list!
Thank you very much 👍👍👍😊😊
WOW 😲
v well explained in easy steps, i thought apple pie is so hard to make, its my fav food after a swim, gng to try it, thanx..😊
Brilliant, a good apple cake and a good fruit cake (oxford lunch type) recipe is what I've been waiting for John, all the others I've copied from you John have worked out great  Thanks and I look forward to trying this tomorrow in work
Amazing and very clear, sir!👍🏼
You sir have reignited the love for baking in me!!!!!!!!!
Thanks for this John another good recipe as my mother made. Brings back good memories
Looks wonderful John...
Save me a piece, John....thank you for sharing and God bless...
Chef John this looks absolutely delicious and simple!
Who doesn't like a good apple pie? I can't find a decent one in the bakeries around my place so I'll be sure to try my hands at this one. It really looks tasty. Thank you @John Kirkwood
My, my, my.  I believe I will be making this pie! 😋
I believe this is the first time I've seen a homemade apple pie without a gap between the cooked fruit and top crust. Brilliant!
Wish I could cook like you. My love life would be a lot better, if I could wow the birds with cooking skills like yours 😎
Looks delicious ❤️
Love that your video is shown with no frills or fuss. Too many apple pie videos are seen as perfection to be achieved, yours  takes us through smoothly and giving us tips I didn't know. Thank you.👍🏼
YUM! My mother made the best pies from the apples growing in our backyard. She always saved those pie crust cut offs and spread them on the baking tray next to the pie. They got a good sprinkle of cinnamon and nice snowfall of sugar, then baked in another cookie sheet on a rack above the pie but were done so much quicker. She pulled them out and they were the "leaves" that we got to eat first. Such a great treat! I have some apples on the table that need to be transformed into one of my good childhood memories - thanks!
Looks delish, John...first time (in my many years) that I've seen a spiced apple sauce used - I can imagine how good that would be in the recipe.  Wont have to 'imagine' for long - going to do what my dear Mum used to do and bake a couple of apple pies on Sunday.  Can't wait !!
Draining the juice and thickening that before adding back to the apples is a chef's secret! I never use just one variety of apples. I use at least three. I include a twirl or two of lemon peel. Instead of water to the corn starch ..... use a good whiskey! You won't be disappointed! Thanks for posting!
As always John hit the nail on the head another home favourites. Spot on, thanks.
Thank you John for this recipe, it looks delicious!! I will be making this pie this weekend for my hubby and sons. Greetings from Honduras, Central America.
I'm going to try this this weekend
Thanks again John , I’ve now tried 6 of your recipes and trust me I’m a novice and every one has turned out perfect like your videos. It is all down to the way you explain everything and how simple you make it.
Thanks John - Looks Great!
That looks gorgeous--I bet it tastes that way, too. The spiced apples sound delicious but I also like apple pie without the spices; do you have any suggestions (or perhaps a recipe?) for making the pie flavorful without the spice mix?
VERY NICE JHON THANK YOU!!
this ist my mom and me one Favoriten pie John
Who doesn't love an apple pie, can't wait to try it your way, Thanx John.
