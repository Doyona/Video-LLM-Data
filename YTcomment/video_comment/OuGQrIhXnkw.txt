Thanks for the video.  I would have liked more information on the size of house he is heating with this stove, and perhaps whether this is a passive house, or just a super insulated one.  Maybe this is covered in other videos?
Goes to show what I've been saying for decades: It's All About The Insulation....
66 degrees! Burr! 76 in my house all winter! Agreed about the straight pipe. We burn one fire a year. From early November through about April First. I fill the stove 100% twice a day (when I get up and when I go to bed) and adjust the thermostat to a low burn (no flames visable). We burn pine exclusively and go through 2-3 cords a winter. It is our only source of heat. Using the thermostat on the stove I can set temperature pretty much where I want to keep and avoid fluctuations. But when it's below zero outside I like coming into 75-80 degrees. The stove is in the livingroom so it's about 8-10 degrees cooler in the bedrooms, perfect for sleeping. We also have the OAK installed (outside air kit). So we load the stove, close the damper, set the thermostat, and we are done for 12 hours (sometimes longer depending on the temperature we have selected). Never have to restart the fire. It burns down to a few hot coals and I put the new load on top of them, close the door, close the damper, set the temperature.
Tip, get a nice stainless steel, ceramic or glass sprayer bottle and if needed add a simple rubber ring gasket in between spraying handle and bottle to keep fumes in from petrol or alcohol based liquids. And just use it to light a fire with one light spray.
Excellent! We also have a very similar wood stove, here in Dallas, Texas. It saved our lives and our plumbing a year ago, when it was -3 F
Maybe he needs a Rocket Batch stove. Could he cut consumption even further?
Clean the  glass will  look  better  with a little bit of ash
Nice looking fire there.

I lived in a Passivhaus in Germany. There was only a towel rail in the bathrooms. There was no other space heating required in line with the philosophy of PHPP.
I've got 7 wooded acres and I get a few cords a year just from trees and branches falling down.  If that's not enough there's always some old half dead tree that needs to come down.
Who is the manufacturer of the stove you use?  Does it have a secondary air burn feature?
everyone is going to wish they put a wood stove in, the natural gas cost is going up 3X this year, and better hope the power dont go off
Im heating some with wood now and i plan on adding a lot more insulation.  I'd rather not have to have cords of wood piled up in the yard.  Less is more.
Disadvantages.... Dirty indoor climate, damaged lungs and fur risk???? Tut tut...
heya I have a wood stove not big enoough to heat up the house but it can keep it on thermeratuurwen it's but my house is not insulated the house is from1903 in that time there was no isolation  but the wall are 30 cm thick so that help's some still thinking of putting on a dry wall and some rockwool inside for isolation the roof is iolated but not thick enough
Dry clement is nice.
I Nice video. Yes, try and stay away from horizontal stove pipes . He is spot on with crap collecting in here . I burn mine hot a few times a month, but still have build up .

When the time comes to look for a new wood stove, Bill might be well served in that space to try something with a smaller fire box. He obviously has found and fine tuned a strategy to make this larger fire box work in this space. He even mentions this but is worried about the wood pile tipping? The great thing about wood too short to stack is that you don't have to feel guilty about not stocking it! Just set up a cage with some fencing to pile it in instead. A smaller stove could be cycled in a more natural manner with a few larger diameter but shorter "chunks" in the box providing more continuous lower level heat output for 6+ hours per burn cycle.
Cellulose isn't thermal mass 🤣
Waste of a lot of papers, you just need to split the wood into small pieces
Thanks for sharing.
That's pretty amazing. I live in Virginia where we have much milder winters and I go through probably a cord-and-a-half to two cords and I built my house only three years ago. This gentleman's insulation job was top notch.
Burns his junk mail....lol.awesome.
Problem your having is caused by burning junk mail n it clugs it up.
We love our stove, we are in SC with 2x4 construction and single digits a couple weeks a year.  Haven’t cut a tree down in 14 years.
Great video.
For all you ad whiners: Broadcast TV had AD spots every 15 minutes. So watching cable freed people from ads. Then ads started getting heavy on cable TV. Then people started watching content online and thought the ad sales would just go to billboards or something else.  Now since the ADS making driving and watching your phone more difficult  ,we have a generation would prefer the ADS on billboards beacause their not looking up to see them anyway. WHINERS!!
Ski country, love it. Sailboat on the coast and  mountain chalet in the winter. How did I not end up like that? I saw a home in Sweden that was so tight that the electric central heater was about 5 inches square. We generally waste all our energy in the USA. This is possible because people get rich off the sales of energy and the byproducts of oil need large distillation quatities.
Burned about 1/2 a cord of wood....and about 4 cords of junk mail
If you want to keep your glass clean.Here's how. Wet newspaper made into a ball then dip this into the COLD ashes in fire and clean COLD glass with this. Keep dipping into ashes and scrubbing until clean. When done wipe clean with clean newspaper. Newspaper works best not paper from junkmail or what have you.
Cool Dave thank yea for sharing
Wow, a "real" Vermonter building a wood fire? I'm from VT..,being doing this all my life...at 57 now I've learned a few things about wood burning....you'll get there eventually, peace.
change out that 90 elbow for two  45s and you will see a difference in the draw
Pine cones also make great kindling. But junk mail pretty good too. :)
I thought this was going to be bill nye the science guy. Click baited. Still watched the whole thing
Junk Mail Firestarter.  I love it !!! LOL 😝
Hello Bill! We met at the Bushcraft Symposium. I gave you my National Park Pass
I guess you and the cameraman didn't notice the fan on top of the stove.
Maybe add 2 45 degree elbows and eliminate your horizontal run could improve cleaning and draft good luck
New drinking game: every time this guy says "ahhhh", drink! You'll be trashed in 2 minutes.
insulation is the thermal mass?  right
I'm no greenhouse gas terrorist, but I don't do anything nearly that dirty either.
If you're having to burn your stove higher than you want because you're sooting up the chimney it means your stove is over-sized for your needs.  Secondly, it appears you're doing uncontrolled burns where the entire load is going all at once instead of burning end to end and using up the volatiles as they're passed back over the fire...common with front-loading windowed stoves.  A simple, time-tested high-efficiency cast iron airtight box stove such as a Jøtul is a better and more economical choice.
75f is like 23c and that’s cold as fuck for me. I need a stove that can heat up entire house and maintain a temperature of about 30c. Any recommendations?
vermont winter lol
Change your pipe to 2 45 degree elbows instead of the 90s.
That junk mail has lots of ink and god knows what additives, chemical bleaches...   Glad I don't have to breathe the smoke next to your house.
Hopefully u clean ur flu every 6 months because that junk mail tends to float up and dont burn
I find that good sized chunks of used MX tyres make excellent fire starters  to get the old power poles going
All I wanted to know is how that heat-powered fan worked on top of the stove. Was it a Stirling motor? Had to Google it myself...   (It uses a Seebeck module to generate electricity)
I’m curious about how the fan works?
Does anyone know whether it exists a video or article about stoves transformed to be fed with wood pellets and worm screw (endless screw / auger)?
How much did that wood stove cost
Could u clean the glass?
Junque mail, nature's fire starter. What brand of stove? Oh, Napoleon, barely heard that.
I know this is a older video so I may not get a answer but I'm putting in a wood stove it's a morso stove 2110 brand new but everyone keeps telling me I need large amounts of space on back and sides plus heat shields so my original plan to go through a roof directly isn't going to work if that's true... but it seems that his stove is in a space with about as much clearance around the stove as I had planned (I would still be adding a heat sheild on all 3 sides) and it appears that he is perfectly safe? Am I just getting overly cautious info? Some are telling me I need 20 inches in back and 36 on either side and then a heat sheild too??? Or they say that the heat sheild will make it ok to cut that in half... WTF I mean people used to burn fires in straw huts! Why would it be so unsafe for me to have a heat sheild all around with 6in out back  and 12in on the sides?
Great video and thank you for sharing.
I’m in the tall pines of northern Az and I use pine cones to start my fires. They work great, much easier than paper.
bill your logs look like kindling
Stove top fans have made all the difference for us. Rather than having a lump of heat just in front of the stove, we now have a fan angled in the direction of our kitchen door and one angled toward the hallway. Meaning our small 4.5kw stove heats our whole  ground floor. Because we invested in a super efficient stove, properly seasoned wood burns totally smokeless and deposits hardly any soot or creosote in the flue. Best investment we've made in the house. And beautiful too.
Does anyone know what thermometer he is using on his stove pipe?
Perfect home for a mass rocket stove. . . One burn a day.
I'm the firestarter, twisted firestarter
Love the pants I need some of those
Metric 96% and rising
I live in NE Minnesota and have heated with wood.  The key thing is no matter what you heat with you only buy insulation once.  Arouund here the insurance companies have put the kibosh on inside wood stoves, we have to use the outside water jacket type.  My house is 1400 sq ft plus a full basement.  I found that in a 9000 degree day winter I only burned about 1.5 full cords of Aspen.    On fuel oil it's about 400 gallons a year or less.  Hard to justify a fancy outdoor wood stove on that.
Best wood stove video on YouTube. Thank you.
Top to down burn is most efficient
I have my Country woodstove burning now. I like burning red fir and Tamarack. House cant be too airtight tho, you need a little draft for the stove to work properly
Would have been nice if you cleaned the glass before making this well made video. I found using news paper and damping it some before patting it into some ash works best. Rub the dirty glass with that will take off the burnt ash on the glass and finish it with a little Windex still using free news paper. I am posting this because someone out there probably doesn't know this. I still have a very old Fuego insert that works .
By the looks of the video you house doesn't look to be a large one.  How many square feet? Also is the heating efficiency due to the floor plan of the house? House designed to circulate heat well
I think you'll burn much less wood if you use larger pieces. I have a similar setup and only load 3 times a day.
Excellent video
How about the horizontal pipe down by the stove? It would be easier for the stove to keep it hot. That’s how mine is. I love Vermont. 😊❤️🇺🇸❄️☃️🌄
You can burn aluminum cans and the aluminum cans will alleviate the creosote from the chimney
Did you see the smile on his face after he lit the fire do you think he could of been a arsonist when he was a kid like catching the woods on fire.
If you come across any renovations of older houses where lathe and plaster walls are being replaced. The lathe makes really good kindling.
You and ' Bear' from alaskan bush people should start a chat room and talk ONLY about fire.  🔥  Your fireside🔥 chat is about fire 🔥while building a fire🔥.  The only thing missing is being surrounded by fire.  🔥 I would like to see Beavis And Butthead clips where beavis says "FIRE".🔥
What about upside down start of your fire?
I just bought a Buck modle 94nc. looking forward to the winter. love a wood fire
U got me on the carbon monoxide part. I don’t know about completely closing everything. Maybe keep the damper open a crack and slow down the air intake instead
And the food when you put it on the tpp woodstove be sooooooo delicious
We have this wood stove in lebanon in Mountain
What is the fan for?
Sounds funny but we've been burning wood 30 years now and 8300' high desert northern NM and refined our fire starting methodology to a propane torch and some fat wood n' kindling  and even with our stove running 8-9 months a year we never use up the whole canister.  Not good to burn anything with colored print. And the embers for us can be problematic living in a wild fire area in the Rockies.  Anyway nice job on the house. We have our main great room and kitchen area-1200 sq' +/- in straw bale and really appreciate it's insulating qualities both in winter and summer. Rest of 2-story sleeping/office areas radiant slab heat which we keep at 68 since our stove throws quite a bit if heat back in there; exterior 2" foam/tyvak with stucco.
That's great. I live in Vermont and heat with wood too, and I'm really impressed by the tiny, 5degree drop over night. What windows do you have? How many pains are they? Thanks
What kind of Fan is that your using I know it turns on when temp gets High enough looking for brand name and if you recommend it ?
Great video! Very cool! Thank you!
Who would want all that mess in the house?
@3:56 the lever you're using, does that just open a larger vent to get more air flow to start the fire faster?
digging the stirling fan on stove 8o)
hey just wondering,  if your horizontal inside pipe is getting a build up of ash, why you don't put in two 45 degree elbows and make that horizontal pipe into a 45 degree pipe?  And just to add, I only cut down standing dead, thereby not having to cut live trees.  And it lessens the available wood to feed a forest fire, just saying.  And it's awesome that you can heat our home with such a small amount of wood.  I live at 3000 ft in BC Canada and I burn 6 cord of wood in a well insulated home I built in 1995.  today it was -31c when I got up at 6 am
i want a super insulated house !
the reason u have buildup is the paper... especially the bent pipe...not good that's why u burn it hot to burn paper out ofpipe not good nice stove tho.
Insulation is not thermal mass.
So you have 12" of insulation .. that's a lot! As far as accomplishing a thermal mass, would 12" of dense packed cellulose be better than 12" of closed cell spray foam?
who cares?
What's the name of that wood burner where can I get it how long will the wood burner for ?
man you're lucky you got all that insulation. i have a comparable size stove with a stone, vertical lined chimney .  i have to  rock that thing 24/7   to maintain 72 when the furnace craps out here in canada.  . only good thing is i can throw 2 big chunks on before bed and she's still pumping heat in the morning but it's 68.  i don't know if you pay for fire wood but if you do your insulation already paid for itself or will.    what's the humidity like  in your house when burning? do you use a humidifier ?  i like to have a cast iron or copper pot with water  and vented lid . it also acts as a thermal mass     and  stays warm long after fire goes out.
These.are.not.good.they.go.cold.when.they.are.out.of.fire. You.need.a.brick.fire.place.to.keep.warm.all.day.long.after.the.fire.has.gone.out. This.is.good.tho.if.you.don't.have.anthing.else.for.emergency.
Hello Bill.  I've had a wood stove in my home since 1990. My latest is a Lopi brand Liberty. We improved our house by insulating with closed foam spray and Marvin windows, and R-60 in the attic. Want to pass on some information I just learned to you.  To clean the creosote off your glass, you can get a paper kitchen towel, I use a half sheet, and wet it, and dip it into the cool ashes in the morning and use that as a pumice to clean the glass.Just a llight dip into some ash and you will be amazed. It does not scratch the glass at all. No more having to buy the expensive cream in a plastic bottle.
Having lived in that part of the country we had a franklin stove man the good ole days
was it mentioned what kind of stove it is?
If would put A T JOINT OUT SIDE WHERE YOUR HORIZONA LAND VERTICAL PIPE HAS 90 ,YOU CAN CAP THE BOTTOM AND END OF T PULL CAPS OFF AND CLEAN ,YOU WON'T NEED HELP. HOPE THIS WILL HELP.
wood burning + 'super insulated' = get a carbon monoxide detector. or three
we had a wood burning stove in our house. We had the same issue with the horizontal pipe as well.  The way we combated it was we shortened the vertical by 1-2 inches and increased the length of the horizontal one by 4 inches.  The horizontal became an incline pipe.  One thing we also had was separate duct-work from above the stove to other areas of the house.  That duct-work had its own thermostat and fan.  When it got to a certain temperature the fan kicked on and drew the warm air to other areas of the house.
The fresh air intake is a must on a super insulated house. I had a neighbor years ago had a pellet stove installed by the local hardware store, no fresh air intake. She was complaining about it burning dirty, I explained about the house being to tight and told her to open the window in the room and crack a window and see what happens, it worked fine after that, but I don't know what she did, if anything to fix it.
Cardboard makes the best kindling.
I found the best fuel to burn is chunks of discarded truck tyres .
Thanks Count Olaf as Stephano.
Maybe a sloping 45 instead of that abrupt 90 would help with buildup?
Al from Lumnah Acres has a video on heating his house only with a wood stove and he has a video on how he cleans the pipe in a really easy manner. The wood stove is in the basement and heats the whole house and the pipe runs out the side of the house and then up.  He lives in NH too. See the link.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbztBD3GewM  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0US5DdjSJ4g
Flue pipe upside down !!
Nice! Love a fire almost as much as the warmth it puts off. Something about getting back to the root's of the simple times I guess.
wood you burn looks to small    i first put crinkle up news paper and small thin wood  to get the fire started  and after a while i fill up the stove with large pcs of wood  for long hot fire
if you burn your stove  at 1000 deg    you should not g et to much cresote and tar build up in the chimney
Props on the well-insulated home.  I have two problems with the method of producing heat.  The first is the particulates that it is very likely that you and the other occupants of the home are breathing.  That stuff is horrible for your lungs.  COPD is not a good time.  The other problem is the overall pollution level (particulates, chemicals) that you're emitting into the environment.  I'd rather see a pellet stove, if you insist on burning wood,  or a gas burner or heat pump.
Love the video. Very well explained. Thanks for sharing. Not many people take the time sharing earned knowledge. Thank you and keep burning!!
Good insulation! Great. It's so awesome to see that you aren't cutting down trees to do this. There are so many sustainably alternatives. Instead of mainstream, one way of doing things, we need a variety of ways to heat, produce electric/light, etc. Some things should be mainstream with just a few options, but there are other ways! Thank you! 😎
I like my house to be in the mid-70s wood does that well.
Lmao typical old dude. Dont touch that thermostat! 66 is fine!
Hi
Mind if I ask what brand of winter pants you're wearing?
Well done sir I love my wood stove
If it were me in my house. I would install a forced air 98% efficient Modulating propane furnace, with a Heat pump, for this application. I mean it costs $10,000-$12,000 but you wouldn't have to spend over 120hrs a year cutting, maintaining, moving wood for the wood stove.
I like what he is doing but, has he thought about all the chemicals coming from the bunch mail he is burning into the air. I think natural Kindle would be better.
Nice video!
Why did he run that pipe horizontal to begin with? Is that even legal? I'd recommend a 45º bend AT MOST!   Anyway, people should look into Rocket Stoves if they aren't into spending much time constantly adding wood to a fire. Also, I've seen some that never actually go out, so no wasting time relighting it every morning. Love the Sterling engine fan he's got! I'd recommend he increase the thermal mass around that fire though! Sixty-five degrees to FAR too cold to wake up to! I have a hard enough time getting out of bed in the morning as it is! Having a large piece of conductive metal with a few bricks to retain the heat would keep more of the heat in his house. (Of course, that would also lower the temp of the exhaust gasses and he would go back to having the creosote problem with his set up.) Basically, once his fire goes out, he would still have a bunch of very hot bricks releasing their energy back into the house during the night which would smooth out some of the major temperature swings he must be having.
You didn't say if your stove is epa certified.  I have one that sends separate air in through the back top and I get a great secondary burn.  Very clean exhaust and you get more heat per wood burned than non epa stove.  Cheers
haha! I kid about heating my home for the year on junk mail.. also use it for starter!  Fantastic assessment and explanation of your setup! I'm a big fan of thermal mass, although I use water: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQQDW6LaZb4
Junk mail has too much of that crappy waxy paper that doesn't ignite or burn well let alone give out much heat.  We found Dollar Tree or Walmart cotton balls ($1.00 a bag for about 100 balls) saturated with isopropyl alcohol or camp fuel works fantastic with dry wood.  One ball and one match between a few pieces of well placed kindling and presto...almost instant fire everytime.  Dry wood is the key.   Hope he has a lot of bug stray for the bugs hiding in all that old grey wood.  LOL>
Please don't waste my time.
Off topic, but what kind of boots and pants were you wearing in this video?
fuck my house damn & how is that fan spinning? The heat fins?
Love this set up, I can't believe how efficient it is. Insulation is certainly the key. I'll bet u don't even get through a whole cord of wood in 1 season. Thanks for sharing. 👍🏼
Sir what kind of Stove is that you have?
Very small stove (smaller stoves are way cheaper) I sell firewood and these small stoves are a real pain to cut and split to fit)
You'd increase your heating moving the stove 18 ins plus from the wall(s). The double wall pipe is costing huge heat loss too.
Thanks for the video, I have been heating my house for many years with wood and I use a lot more than you do. My house has six inch walls and I think its well insulated but not close to yours. I plan on moving to Vt. In a few years to retire, I will keep your ideas in mind when I relocate. Thanks
The main problem with wood heat is just how much time it consumes. Even if you buy your wood cut, split and delivered you still have to stack it and hack it. Then lump from the outside to the inside. Then there's all the fiddling with the stove itself. Now you know why I live in Vegas after 20 years in Maine. Watching this guy kneeling before his steel alter made me appreciate just how much I love my thermostat.
Great job and this is what im having for my next house, my current one is fire heated too.  The thing you can do that I dont see him doing (and I dont have in my current house) is to connect the stove to floor heating or radiators + the hot water accumulator tank.  With a real "heating stove" not one of those he's using thats made for display/heat 50/50, buy a water loaded fully shut stove, those have 80% efficiency. Here in sweden people run 1 fire a day at below -20c with those kinds of stoves and it provides all the heat and hot water.  So look into it deeper and design right, because if you do you dont even need a pump to move the hot water around.  Regards
Isn't that why they send us the junk mail? As fire starter.
If you live in Jamaica you won't need a wood stove. Ok that is as relative as the other comments of what you should do . Someone will complain if you hung them with a new rope. So nice work thanks for sharing.
Sorry,  I'm not impressed with a stove that requires all that manual operation. What happens when the "expert" isn't available?  Wood stoves need to operate safely with a minimum of expertise.  I don't favor fans  for combustion air since it would be very easy to overheat the stove,  especially if turning it off is neglected.  I've operated my woodstove in Seattle's moderate climate,  in a poorly insulated home for a third of a century now.  I pretty much never operate the gas furnace.  I favor a stack temperature of 350-400 degrees most of the time,  and avoid stack temperatures higher than 500 degrees.  I agree that having the elbows is to be discouraged.  My vent has a gradual turn about two feet above the stove and then a second gradual turn to move the vent pipe farther towards the wall by about 6".  Otherwise,  it's a straight shot.  Even that ought to be avoided.  Personally,  to start a fire I favor a half sheet of newspaper dipped in a little old motor oil with some shavings or fine tinder on top  ---but that's just a matter of style  The best wood stove I ever saw was in a ski club in the mountains east of Seattle.  It was about eight feet long and four feet in diameter,  and logs four feet long were pitched in whole.  A metal screen around the stove  protected people from the hot stove and gave a place to dry out clothing. .  -
I've been burning wood my whole life in New England, you're dreaming of this efficiency. Let's see more about the insulation. A rocket stove mass heater may Grant you those dreams but not from a wood stove with outside air....need more proof.
Nice fire
What type of wood stove are you using?
Not allowed here in montreal.
Air Draw is Key & room around Stove for Air Circulation is just as Important ...  Depends Somewhat on Your House, [ Single Level as opposed to 2 story ] ... We are Spoiled here in Or , [ Coastal  influenced Area ] Our overall Winter  temperature is Higher .. Insulation is Very Important , but Stove Design , quality of Wood & Air-circulation are the most Important factors ... R - 40 / Floor & Ceiling - R - 21 walls ... = less than 2 Cords pr Winter ...
The only question I had at the beginning of the video was “ where does the combustion air come from”? Outside air source, only way to go, good job. Perfect set up.
2 45 degree elbows  might help in place of the 90. We have a Blaze King Princess wood stove its a cat stove it works as advertised had it 6 yrs no problems. If you are into efficacy check out these stoves. TM
The thermal operated fan is better off being pointed towards the flue, so it draws cold air over the hot flue and heats it up, therefore pushing warm air past the flue and into the room.  Just my opinion from using my own thermal fan.
He recommends an insulated flue - wouldn't you be better off with uninsulated to allow radiant heat into the room?
Thanks for the video.  I really enjoyed it.  Very similar to my set up.  I'd love to share my love of insulation and wood burning.  Here goes...  I added a lot of insulation to my old house >100 years old.  A lot!  I burn about that same amount of wood volume down here in WV.  If it's not too cold I usually just burn about three, 8 inch long, 3 - 4 inch split pieces in the AM.  I can keep a fire going all day without getting too hot if it's below 20 by moving the hot coals away from the air inlet and by putting in one chunk at a time on before the coals disappear completely.  I can burn a visible flame all day if it's single digits, which I love to feed the fire.  I too don't burn a fire at night and it gets down to 65 in the house by morning, never below 60, just like you experience.  I have a ¼ steel plate coal stove with ash pan.  Lots of room for ash.  One year I went nearly all winter without removing any ash.  I blocked off the grate except for a small 6 x 6 inch area to allow in air and where I place the small wood pieces.  I would like to use outside air but don't have that option.  My draft is very strong because of that small air opening resulting in no need for kindling just two sheets of newsprint gets the old dry chunks going.  Most of the time I like to burn the wood hot and fast and by late morning the house is good to go till the next day.  My flue is super insulated and I burn only dry wood.  I never see creosote in the pipe.  The SS steel flue is 35 years old.  I check it yearly, but there's never anything in it.  I took out my gas furnace and made a closet in that space.  I can leave the house unoccupied with just a small unvented heater with thermostat control.  I love insulation.  I built myself a 36 x 48 straw bail (infill) two story garage/storage/workshop.  Quadrapane windows facing south.  Nearly sound proof and requires - almost - no heat or air.  If it wasn't for taking the cars in and out!  It has a commercial refrigerated space garage door.
You must clean your glass mister !
Can’t tell if your stove pipe is double wall if not it’s installed upside down
Love Bills house, to fix the draft issues / build up of ash / creosote in the horizontal run change out that 90deg bend to (2) 45deg bends, its will work wonders, also switching to double wall smoke pipe will keep the flue gases hotter reducing condensation and the formation of creosote. Its worth looking into.
A hot fire in the AM keeps the creole nice and dry.
Since when did dense-packed cellulose become thermal mass?
all that junk mail ash will be flying up the flue and sticking to the walls of the flue with so much draft at the start of the fire. you should use kindling and a fire lighter instead.
There's a bunch of people making stupid comments on how Mr. Hulstrunk needs this and that. This man lives in Vt, the part of Vt that usually gets more snow and is colder than most of Vt. If you have ever been there, you know what I mean, if you have never been, you have NO idea what it's like. He is heating his entire house on less than a cord of wood a year which would be miracle in Ct, never mind where he lives. He deserves the respect for building such an efficient home, not comments from ignorant people. Jmo.
90 degree flue bends are a very bad idea
The only way to compare the amount of wood used is the weight of the wood. One kilo of dry wood has got approx the same amount of energy.
You might look at a top-down fire like we build. Big wood goes in first, then kindling,  and then your paper or firestarter. This is a preferred method for the new reburn stove designs.
Pretty incredible the small amount of wood you use!  Wouldn't trade my Ashley Stove for anything.  Love the radiant heat and the comfort of the flame.
And that glue you used on that tile is MOST.   likely COMBUSTIBLE.   😨
its at least 26 inchs.especially if there is any combustable wood. Two by fours example.
BILLS stove is way to close to the WALLs.
The thing that concerns me with bringing old wood into the home is the possibility of introducing woodworm or other unwanted guests into the house.
Nobody uses a stool.
got to looking at this and thought hum with a mass rocket heater he could burn 25 pounds of wood a day and heat that house leaving him using perhaps 80% less wood per season.  The problem with stoves like this.. 80% of the heat goes right out the flue
Rather than wood stoves you might consider researching about masonry heaters. They are ideal for super insulated homes. Wood stoves tend to have more extreme ups and downs in temperature. You build a fire and it soon gets too hot so you let it burn out. Then it gets too cool.       Masonry heaters, you build a fire once or twice a day and the masonry works like a heat battery,  releasing he heat throughout the day.   My grandfather has one he built himself, they work great. They do take up more space than a wood stove. That can be a negative or a plus depending on your point of view. At my grandfathers it's a centerpiece the family gathers at. But the upside is they take much less wood than a woodstove and are much less hassle to run and maintain.   Search for a video "The basics of how a masonry heater works".
my grandfather built our home in 1965, its not super insulated but the windows have been upgraded in the past decade and it is ver easy to heat, we use a harman coal stove and burn wood and coal and it stays very warm, I would never get rid of it
I just love extremely well insulated homes cause payback is fast and home is nice and cozy...
