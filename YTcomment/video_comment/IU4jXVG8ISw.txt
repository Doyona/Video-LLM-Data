Your presentation is not clear and between your mumbling and laughing, I couldn’t understand any of what you are attempting to say.
Your sound or voice is not clear, and the kids in the background us really distracting and annoying
what happened to the flower and sugar mixture did she throw it away
Is this chick drunk or something? Fkg hell 👎🙄
talking to yourself?
I tried to follow. Seems she’s everywhere with this recipe..
You look like little crazy,
🤦
the recipe looks great but I am confused as to where when and how much cream or milk to add (not in recipe either). Thank you
We have a lemon tree in the backyard that just became ripe so I've been looking for a good lemon bar recipe. Yours was simple so I gave it a try, they just finished cooking completely so I cut them up and tried them. HOLY CRAP they're like candy! They are SO GOOD! I've never made lemon bars before in my life and this recipe was quick, simple and DELICIOUS. Thank you!!
She skipped the part she said and if you want you can add cream or milk instead but then it didn’t show her adding cream or milk some of
What temperature do you bake it at? You just said it was going to take 40-45 min..
Also you edited it and skipped a lot of steps like the cream and adding the flour and sugar mix. Ugh sorry. I tried but I'm winging it from here. Its take it down and try it again if I were you. Totally missing several key aspects now I get why everyone was hard on You.
I wish you show the finished product after you bake at least a picture or a closer video so that people watching would see it. And please avoid too much laughing bc we cannot understand anything what you said its just laugh. good luck!
P.S. make your moms German pie thing.... please, wing it if you don't have the full recipe. Is your mom German?
1st off you are very bubbly and fun. I like that you had a nice story to add to your recipe as well as the importance of no contact for sugar and eggs for the custard. (New stuff every day) I've never made this before and watched  several videos before coming to yours and I gotta say, "you won me over." I will use your technique tomorrow and will let you know how it comes out. Please keep keep up the good work & please don't mind the haters. You are awesome, however they do have a valid point because your volume does tend to fade a bit in your explanation but I can fill in the gaps. I read a few of their comments and they can be so stupid sometimes, with Q's like the size of the pan and all the shit like that, like really? .... C'mon figure it out. So Keep smiling sweety, all of that will devalope the more you progress. You made me smile and that's better than 90% of the boaring ass technical videos I've been watching on how to make this yummy dessert. I can't wait to try it and to see what else you can put together.  Cheers!😎
I don't do Instagram...next!
Mommy Is A Chef: “So the sugar can not go on your eggs...EVER because it burns your eggs...”  Also Mommy Is A Chef: *Grates lemon zest and pours fresh squeezed lemon juice on raw eggs!* 😳😳😳
Annoying , keeps on mumbling
Haste un chongo por favor!! I mean, really...who dresses up to bake?
the hair, the nails, the rings, is a no no in the kitchen
super, OK        cream or milk? for my coffee?
the sound sucks... also the recipe. she is more like a hair styles not a baker.
For all those saying you mumble, okay you COULD be louder; however, I have cooked often enough in my 49 years that I can follow what you’re doing without perfect audio.  Please keep posting great recipes (which are NOT on my keto diet, I’ll have you know!) :-). I cannot wait to make your doughnut recipe!!! CHEERS FROM IOWA!!!
i could've SWORN you had a video that you did where you made like a lemon loaf cake but it's no where to be found?!! 😩
Omgosh where did you buy that huge glass jar?
What size pan?
Stop mumbling
yay can't understand your saying .just laughing..
Inaudible to subscribe
When do you put the confectioners sugar on???
I would never eat anything of the ground
Honestly I would subscribe but I can’t really hear you. You mumble a lot and your hair is distracting. Also making it seem like it’s something hard to do doesn’t make me want to try your recipe. And you should show us your finished product instead of telling us to go to your Instagram page to see how they turned out. That’s giving us more work than we need and it only looks like your desperate for followers in social media, which is just tacky.
Hey
try to speak a little  clearly and louder please...can hardly understand what  you are saying... just following what you are doing.
one cup lemon juice?
love the dress btw !
How many cups is two sticks of butter ?
You must have got a big family.  Look at that huge glass container. I want one of those. Where did you get those?
looks like a good recipe but does your hair ever get in the food?
Thank you for taking the rings off
Can't hear you. Your audio is weak,
At what point did you put the sugar in?
I will definitely try it out....  I love your recipes 🌹✨bendiciones
💖🌺Beautiful as always. That story 😂 I would probably eat any recipe of yours off the floor! Like a just cleaned floor haha! Your recipes are golden! I can't wait to try these. I have been baking a lot more! These look amazing love! 💖🌺
Delicioso!!! Con un buen café cargadito, Excelente combinación!
thanks so much for the  tips i learned  today never to add sugar directly to eggs never knew it would burn them
