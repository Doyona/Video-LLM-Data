Thanks for this. Been trying to get an  non buttermilk recipe for awhile.  In states here.  I’m guessing two cups flour n tsp baking soda n tsp salt. Raisins  Add milk to combine.   I ll try it I’m sure it ll turn out great
Gorgeous
Yum!....Would this recipe work with Gluten Free flour?
OF COURSE YOGURT IS ACIDIC. MILK WITH A LITTLE VINEGAR WILL WORK AS WELL. (NO ORANGE ZEST?)
Errr nope the cross is to bless the soda bread, to let the fairies out you poke a hole in the centre of each quarter, also since when are the sultanas part of irish soda bread?
Love it with yoghurt thank you
Oh was looking for dairy free
Beautiful ly baked colour 😍 crisp and yumcious 😋👍😀👌
Amazing, I have watched many videos in the last few weeks about bread making, especially irish soda bread. Last night I sat sat there thinking about the buttermilk problem and wondered if it wouldn't be possible to use live yoghurt. What was the first thing I saw this am on YouTube, your channel, its fate. I am going to try this ,Thank you so much.
My Irish Great-grandmother added caraway seeds as well as sultanas.
RECIPE   Irish soda bread with yoghurt  250 g (2 cups )plain flour  1 teaspoon salt  1 teaspoon baking soda  two handfuls of raisins  150 mL (2/3) cup yogurt  1/4 cup milk
Great video super easy to follow recipe and the bread looks delicious. Thank you!
Gosh! You're gorgeous!
I love your demonstrate of how to make Irish soda bread. You are so right about no kneading. Best video on YouTube for traditional soda bread!
Lovely video, your voice is soothing, not grating like so many and I like that you don't blabber for 1/3 of the lesson before actually getting started. Would you please post the recipe also?
The cross cut in the top is to bless the bread, you poke a hole into each corner to let the fairies out ...
Soak the fruit in cold tea overnight x
Thankyou.
thanks the video came in handy but I kind of burn the end cuz I had no cooking paper😂😂😂but thanks anyways😉
ive been making soda farls using yogart this long time and you are the first ive seen do the same good on you
What oven heat setting as I not u times for 35 mins..I usually time for 40 mins on 180
Been making it for 20 year plus using natural yogurt, or just plain soured milk
What are the exact measurements and where can I get them ShakespearesChin
Great to find a recipe I can maybe try with goats milk and goats yoghurt, as my husband cannot take cows.
Hi there. Just tried your recipe, having just found baking, I was looking to find ways of making bread, lots of recipes but alas, no joy in making it .!! I came across your recipe for soda bread, must say it was easy to follow and mine turned out ok for first try, didn't look as nice as yours, lol.  Tastes ok, will have another go all the same. Thanks. Kevin.  x
Just put mine in the oven, needed a quick  accompaniment to Lasagne so I didn't use sultanas. Thanks for the video, your  voice is very soothing :)
Looks good
I loved everything, your voice,  the traditional aspect of the top cut (letting out the fairies) then cutting, showing the slight spring in the bread and then eating it, hearing the sound of the crunch, I just wanted some so badly. And then you made it for breakfast. But the best part was..... no nonsense, no fiddling around with finding tools or too much talking.. you just got down to making bread... it was short and to the point.... thats the way I bake. Thanks Please make more when you can :)
Greetings from the States! Thank you for the baking lesson. Due to lack of plain yogurts in my fridge, I ended up using cherry yogurt and threw in raisins and walnuts to add some variety. All-in-all, my first soda bread was a success thanks to you. Cheers!
So glad you liked it.. let me know if you give it a go :)
Thank you kindly
That looks really yum and easy to make! :)   Thank you for sharing!
No probs :) You're great.
Yes it can be hit and miss sometimes so good old yoghurt comes to the rescue. Glad you liked the birdies.. it was a glorious morning ;)
Such a shame re soda, maybe you could try my recipe for scones which are similar. Glad you liked me appearing in the vid, I always feared it would impose on recipe facts but I think you'll be seeing more appearances from now on.
Thats lovely to hear thank you. We're largely ok this end but there are occassions where the shop doesnt have it and so this method comes in useful. Its a pain though as I make this pretty often.
Thank you so much! :)
Me too.. I've never tried with Greek yoghurt but I dont see any reason why not! Give it a go and let me know how it goes!
You never fail to impress, I think you'll be in my next shout out video :)
Another great video, and i like the personal touch of seeing you in it, unfortunately i wont be making it, because soda makes me quite ill :(
I like this one with the live yoghurt. Very easy! I often find buttermilk sold out at the shops so this is a great alternative. Love the tweeting birdies over your end card too, lovely!
