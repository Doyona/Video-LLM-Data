To me, the best Chinese restaurant is the SUN WAH.It is located in the North side of Chicago at Broadway and Argyle (on Broadway). I have been visiting this restaurant for around 30 years. I was watching when they take out the Gailan flowers, they don't use them in the food. I did ask to the owner what is the reason for that, the owner told me: because in the flowers is a big concentration of insecticides. Incredible, this is to take care of customers and...attention to details...bravo Sun Wah, I love that !!!
Thanks for posting this video. I tried it tonight and I am just so happy with the result! Thank you!!!
I tried some of this at a dim sum restaurant and was instantly addicted!!!!! OMG its SOOOOO GOOOOOD!!!!!
Thank you 🙏😍😋♥️

Thankyou
Bad audio
Sooo helpful. Thank you🙏
Blanching probably reduce the bitterness in gai lan    I pick up some great idea from your video. Thanks 👍
Thank you! I followed the blanching option for this and my broccoli turned out amazing. The sauce is soo good too.
Can one find gai Lan at the Asian grocery store?
Letting you know I couldn't see any wine listed in the recipe at your website. https://tasteasianfood.com/chinese-broccoli/ It was delicous.
Hello Mr Kwan, please, what oil do you use and is it the same oil most of the time or different oils are used dependind on the food?
Thank you. Your video saved  my life from my wife killing me.  Super Thanks! :)
This was really helpful, I'm going to use these tips forever, thank you!
Hmm. Nice. But I am allergic to garlic!! I will use my homegrown kailaan another way.
Thanks for the great Kai Lan recipe!!! This is so so good.
Thank you, Chef! I made your gailan and green bean pork tonight! Itadakimasu!
감사합니다
too much salt
Thank you.
I love this recipe it is simple delicious and easy to make.
Yummy!!! Thank you for sharing!
Another simple approach:  - Boil until tender with some water and oil in the water.  - Drain, put on plate and add salt to taste.  - Note, you don't have to scrape with a peeler. That's a huge hassle if you cook a lot of Gai Lan like we do. You can also snap the end of the Gai Lan by hand as it will naturally break off at the point of where the stem is fresh. Cutting with knife will not do this.  This is a more Cantonese purist approach and will help your taste buds develop for vegetables. Sauce is maybe for old and/or bitter Gai Lan.  You'll never truly taste the subtle sweetness of deliciously fresh Gai Lan with oyster sauce, soy sauce, etc.
Thank you! This was very helpful.
Yummy 😋 looks delicious! 💗
love it thank you
The Kai Lan is young, no need to peel off the skin. Your way is the old fashion frying the Kai Lan. The latest way is, cut the stem a line, Heat oil and fry the ginger then garlic, some salt, and water, Once boils, drop the stem side in then the whole plant, cover it and let it cook for a few mins, once cooked, add in the mixed well sauce --oyster sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, cooking wine , sugar , stir and dish up. I don't add in these sauces but only sesame oil, cooking wine, and dish up
Thank you for this recipe. However, when blanching the broccoli, you stated to add 2 tsp of salt with 1 liter of water ...... it made it sooooooooooo salty, I had to wash the broccoli and re-add the sauce. The 2 tsp salt is too much !!!
Love this, thank you! Making it for dinner tonight
No simple, no 3 step..
Do you need to add the wine?
Love the way he explains why certain ingredients are used.
I love Chinese broccoli. It's my favorite green vegetable.
Great.👍. Thanks
I love your videos. Please make one for salt and pepper chicken wings.
I'm confused - @ 3:51 you said turn up the heat to dissolve the sugar and then add some wine. But didn't you already add the sugar and wine when you prepared the sauce @ 1:11?
good work, thank you
Beautiful! Thank you Kwan.
Hi Chef, I'm Muslim,can I avoid the using of wine,is the taste still there?? Tq.or can use other ingredients beside wine..
This is Kailan,not broccoli
Thank you for your recipes. They are great, unlike many recipes which are not thorough and skip many steps.
Thank you chef i really appreciate your work... Since I'm living in China I've no idea how to cook some typical Chinese dish at home especially this Chinese Broccoli
