New Years resolution: Wear gloves 2019: Still not wearing gloves 😂
but who tf came up with the idea of fried/baked marbles?
Crap, I think I forgot to do this on the last video... Please Collab with Ben and Tyler and ooh! 3 challenges to make something that each of the ladies would like - all three judge each challenge without knowing who made what and decide which is the best one out of the three made for each of the three challenges. For bragging rights of course lol. And if you understand what I'm trying to say here...I'm impressed :)
"Marbles"  Yes, you lost 'em.
There was this one point where I just could not watch any cooking videos bc I would be so scared that they would slice their fingers off😂 Thanks rob

Am I the only one that’s a little freaked out by him saying that shit was gonna get weird, cause the last couple of years have been fucking weird.
Who’s here in 2018?!?!
I wonder if Corrine is kinda like his babysitter
i have over 800 marbles
I tried this pin awhile ago and it worked and it was so cool and very beautiful. They made the entire house smell really weird. I repeated the steps twice too and it worked well.
I love you guys😍😍
Well I just wanted to watch this video again because I know he bleeds.....
Rob put a black light on the marble and it will glow

THE KRAGLE THE ULTIMITE WEPON
2017 anyone?...... Just me... Okay then ;-;
I don't know - this video is about BAKED marbles.  If you tried actually FRYING them, as the name of the technique implies, the result ***might*** be different.  However, I definitely would wear safety goggles and put some kind of a cover over the frying pan - a splash guard made of screen-like material that allows air through but is made to prevent pops of grease or food from flying all over is probably the perfect thing to use.
Do vegan caviar!

Please do galaxy pants
I saw a video on how they make marbles. It's a ridiculously tedious process. It's really cool but definitely not a job I'd want to have. The swirled ones are especially time consuming. Which gives me a thought. You should see if there's a diy marble process. I think that would probably be bullshit because they are made by professional glass blowers. But it seems like it would be entertaining AF.
🤢too much blood, y is rob still alive?? 😂
you know that tiny shards of glass can end up in yer vines
I'm not small, round, and made of glass.... I'm a furry wolf / demon thing...

@ThreadBanger. I did these for Xmas 2015 and failed at it - hadn't watched your video and used a different threader. Instead I did a flat marble and flat penandant thing to attach to my necklace. Here's a hack if you want color paint the underside of the flat marble and it looks awesome. Gave it to the women in my family and just got an email the other day that 3 people said they looked awesome to my grandmother.
u can but then in boiling water then put them in ice water
I did this shit waaay before you but the only thing is I wasn't careful at all... I just putted those mutherfuckers in the fire, took them out with spoon and put them in water to cool down... and later smash them to get those little cute cristals. xD

You can buy round glass beads [ie, ball-shaped] that are already cracked. They're ready to use for jewelry, they're pretty, they don't require "frying" or other fuckery, and you don't have to worry about them breaking and slicing you up.
Yeah,maybe you should let Corrine make the pins with glass involved in them😂

Diy bath bombs
I looked at the page where that photo came from, and they said nothing about it glowing. Because of the crackled glass and the flash from the camera (that much is apparent from the shadow under the marble) light reflected and made it appear like it was glowing. Nothing more, and no photoshop. Just a trick of the light reflecting on the crackle from the camera flash. And next time, don't be such a newb. Use gloves.
Put confetti in clear balloons

That had to hurt. And every week too
In my room in my house, I had a container that was full of marbles. My house burned down and every now and then, sifting through the ash I find these shattered, but still intact marbles. I find it very fun to throw the shattered marbles on concrete or a brick wall, they shatter in to tiny pieces.
Kragle!!! LMAO

The bleeping mildly annoys me, considering you seem to swear a lot without giving a second thought and, well... the bleeps are so short that you can tell what swear you're blurting out anyway. It feels like a cheap piece of useless editing, like canned laughter in sitcoms.

Where did you get the necklace with the circle
Do fries ice cream
Can you please please please start using better safety measures? I really enjoy your videos but watching you make very bad safety choices is hard.  And then watching the massive amount of blood or injuries is pretty touch too. It's really not that hard to practice proper safety.

To lend me the necklace you should have took in all the marbles in all the broken ones also. The tiny shards that you killed yourself with well chilled your hand but we just hit the big shards of oma and just bloom on to make a good giant ball and make sure that none of the shard that I didn't give it to your girl as like a present

Please put a Friggen blood warning when there is real or fake blood, even though I do not have hemophobia ( which is a hardcore fear of blood) it still unsettles me. Having anxiety disorder though, I know this full horribleness of going into a panic attack. It's not fun, please think about your viewers. :) +threadbanger @threadbanger

Painful
Raindow slim
So, on average, how many of these craft projects make you bleed?  I've seen 4 videos and you're 3 for 4 so far.  Congratz for not shedding blood into the galaxy slime, but overall I see a slightly distressing trend here.
oh my goodness the blood .... LOL
Your hand!!!!
everytime he says he 'is bleeding' i think he is being for real and then i realized its fake ugh i hate it when he does it
you should try duck tape roses
I cringed XD
Mind trying this? http://pinterest.com/pin/A9hoIgAQQMIBl-3X-FYAAAA/

Back corn starch balloons  See how far they bounce when threw at high rates of speed at the wall (corn starch is neat if you mix it with water and hit the surface hard it's like hitting a solid, but set something on it, it sinks)
Oh goodness the blood!!!
what happens when you pour salt on a slug? some people say it explodes or squeals or burns?
So they found out u could do that like one day just like "O" ima go put marbles in the oven n see what happens
I will buy u band-aids
Silly kids, you can't fry marbles!
Holy shit his hand
Marbles...
Make a cool neckless out of that you made
Kragle, i get that reference .
Oook that was obvious. Marbles with colors and swirls inside are not uniform as the single colors are, so they snap there. Also raising temp was risky, you should wait more time, else glass can explode
Finished trying this out with some flat glass gems, and I can say it probably works better with flats than with round marbles. I put 22 gems of many sizes and varieties of colors in the oven at 500°F for 20 minutes than gently tipped them into the ice bath. Here are a few observations on the final results:  -This works just as well for darker glasses, but might be better if used for a suncatcher or stained glass project.   -The lighter colors show more of the cracked glass if you put a foil behind it.   -It works well for frosted and sea glass, almost as good as the pinterest picture. Very interesting combination!  - This project also works well for gems that have a 'rainbow' sheen on them, looks almost like the Arkenstone in The Hobbit trilogy.  So maybe it is a surface area thing, where more surface area = more crackles. I'll have to test my theory next time I do this. Hope this helped anyone who wants to try this!
Make a picture transrome in to Wood

*shudder* blood D: Awesome tutorial though! So tempted to try this...with gloves ._. And all you nob ends saying 'What do girls do during their period every month is they don't like blood?' like a douche; well, not all of us particularly like periods. Besides, that isn't bleeding from a cut is it? No. AND, the 'blood' from a period isn't 100% blood. There is hardly any blood over the whole course of the period. So, shut up. :)

I've watched 2 videos of yours and I fucking love you
lego movie reference. I see what u did there 😏
My daughter is very upset that you got hurt . Wants to know if your ok .
U can use good words
Prank
Normally I forget about liking videos even when I comment on them because I just don't thnk of it. The like button isn't right in my face either like most sites, but I made an exception because you called the krazy glue "kraggle" and that made me happy. Everything is awesome.   I also think if you just baked them a couple times at 350 they migh tnot have broken? The reason they crack is because of the heat change so going from 500 to ice bath might be TOO much for some of them, but 350 to ice twice might've worked better.  They still don't look that cool only because of the glow effect that was added to the picture.
Rere fried 😹

Every time this guy bleeds, my... 'Mother Hen' nature kicks in. My jaw drops, i cover my mouth. I sometimes wonder if the blood is real or not. I'm not squeamish or anything, but I feel like I wanna run, get towels, bandages and whatever i can get my hands on to keep infection out. And no, I'm not a mother, but there is a reason i always play a Healer in MMO's or RPGs.

When making pottery sometimes people place marbles at the bottom of bowls before throwing them into the kiln. It's really cool because the kiln heats them up so that the marbles cover the entire bottom and that gives it the crackle look you created by heating them up in your oven. :)
I saw this on pinterest and it would be super cool, if it worked. try this please https://www.pinterest.com/pin/559220478701438246/  thanks, I love your videos, look forward to them every week! :)

I've done this before but I put my marbles in a frying pan on the stove instead of the oven. It worked like a charm.
This pin is cool too http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/how-to-remove-a-tattoo
use a blowtorch it will turn out better, used to do this for when i was a kid. i used to heat marbles until red hot  nearly melting temp is the key a little bit trial and error might help. as you put red hot marble in water the outer glass cools faster then inner hence this creates strain on glass surface tus making it strong like tempered glass

ThreadBanger Rob, now this isn't exactly in a Pin or online, but here's something cool I did in my Chemistry Class last year.  You'll need two bowls, liquid soap, water, and straws. Put liquid soap in a bowl and put water and mix it up. Take the other bowl and just put water. Okay now dip one end of the straw in the soap water and blow it onto a table by putting the straw on the surface of the table. It may take a few tries but once you have a decent bubble, take anything and put it in the bowl of water and now you can put it in the bubble. Please Try it?

Hey, I'm a glass blowing artist so I think I can explain why the color marbles didn't make it. Colors cool the glass and make it harder to form when I'm in the shop. There are some colors that are cooler and some colors that are warmer but overall they still make the glass cooler than regular transparent glass. This also applies with your project. When you put them into the oven, the uncolored glass was able to take the heat better and stay intact and when you "shocked" them into the water, the colored glass cooled down and was unable to keep it's bond as one solid marble. I hope this makes sense.
Post more videos! I love watching them! You make my day!!! Thank you!

It works a lot better if you boil the marbles in water until you hear them bounce and then take them and put them into cold water it works a lot better I use to do this a lot

Great!!!
You can get a better result, if you do it on your stove top and move the marbles around.

Maybe instead of Photoshop they put a blue led behind some white paper for the photograph? Sorry you burned yourself but glad you didn't try that with glass out of a kiln. Also never take glass right from a kiln into an ice bath. You both should get yourself a microkiln as a starter. I did and it worked great. I found mine at Hobby Lobby. Warning - you might get hooked on glass fusing. :p  - Heidi

You definitely should have played around with the temperature a bit. I am also baffled at how someone could get baked and friend wrong...you fry something on the stove, typically in a frying pan. You bake something when you put it in the oven.

Please take this constructively: I realize that the fun of the show is watching you fail a bit, but this one tipped me over the cliff of illusion. Obviously many of these injuries are fake (previous eps included), but this one was a bit too fake.  Otherwise keep these episodes coming, my friends and I are loving them!
