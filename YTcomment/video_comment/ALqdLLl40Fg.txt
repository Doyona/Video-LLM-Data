Kate Spade

This cake looks amazing! My first time coming across this video and this cake is making my mouth water. I was wondering if I doubled the recipe if I could use 2 circle cake pans since I don’t have square cake pans on hand ? This video is awesome!
Great ❤️
Your recipes are awesome, i tried this, it came perfect. Thankyou Ma'am. 🙏
Glad you have this recipe! I'm planning on making it soon.
Hi Stephanie I really enjoy your Beautiful Cake 🍰🎂👍👍❤️❤️ Recipes Old And New because they Simple and Easy To Follow And Make and Are Beautifully Deeeeelicious 🍰🎂👍👍❤️❤️ Thank You Do Much for Sharing Your Beautiful Knowledge and Recipes On Baking @ Joy Of Baking 👍👍😊😊❤️❤️👍👍🍰🍰🎂🎂❤️❤️
I've been using this recipe for my wife's birthday for 9 years now. I've tried at least 1 dozen recipes, and this one is still our favorite.
You are Angel... I love watching your Channel.. Baking made so simple. 🌹
You are the best!
I was about to give up on baking, especially because i've tried recipe with 'ultimate chocolate cake' or 'the best chocolate cake' as the title and it came out..... dry, crumbly, too sweet, overall disappointing.. Then i came across this video, and i think i won't need any other chocolate cake recipe!  It is so moist but not overly dense. I reduce the amount of sugar to 175gr, but i think if i want to use less sugar, i will add 195gr instead (same amount of the flour)..  I do love rich+decadent cake with coffee and buttermilk/sour cream, but we can get a really delicious chocolate cake with this simple recipe..  For hardcore chocolate lovers, you might wanna watch her "Chocolate Butter Cake" video!
It’s easy I’m aware no eggs definitely will bake this 😘
After pouring ganache should I refrigerate it
😀😊🙏💋💕
No Eggs dear!?
No eggs 🤨?! An eggless chocolate cake recipe.
This cake is so so much good.  I love it. It is so moist, the chocolate layer on the top is important, it let the cake more and more good taste and beauty.
I made this cake for my son’s birthday today and it turned out soooo nice. For ganache i used creme fresh instead of heavy cream and cocoa powder instead of baking chocolate and it still turned out perfect. I want to post a photo on your Facebook page but does it have a feature of searching a specific recipe? Otherwise it is hard to find if it is an old video.
I like this all in one easy recipe! Is it possible to use Creme fresh instead of heavy whipping cream to make ganache?
SHES CHOCOLATE CAKE AT THE BEGINNING XDDD
Hi,can i use olive or canola oil instead of butter.
Hello Ma'am, plz tell why people add Cake gel in all cake recipes and why it is useful..
Can we substitute maple syrup for sugar?
Best cake ever/used self rising and sifted the dry ingred./ used cider vinegar.
Stephanie,Thank you for all your instructional videos.Everyone I've followed has been flawless.
I love this cake but everytime after cooling it starts to crack and break in the middle , any help ?
How to store this cake in the refrigerator? Am making this as a layered chocolate ganache birthday cake
Hi Stephanie - looks AWESOME! Could we replace butter with oil since you mentioned that oil keeps the cake moist and soft if we need to refrigerate it (which I do need to do)?  Also no need for milk or yogurt here? Thanks
I am new to baking. Thanks to Stephanie, I am quite popular now as a baker. I have made this cake a few times now. Always a winner. I don't think this is just a snacking cake. I think this cake can be eaten at any occasion/treat/ celebration even. It is absolutely fantastic.

This is the best chocolate cake ever, and so easy! I’ve made it at least 10 times, and it’s always perfect. I try it with different frostings, from fudge frosting to cream cheese frosting to cream cheese with orange zest. The cake is so moist and delicious. I cut it up and freeze serving size portions and it’s just as good, so it freezes well. Thank you Joy of Baking!

Doubled this recipe and tried it today. Came out perfect!!! Definitely a keeper. Thank you!!!

The baking soda measurements differ between the video and the website   I think the video is the correct one  since I followed the website and the baking soda taste was so obvious

I was skeptical to try this because i never made cake without eggs but wow i'm glad i did! Best chocolate cake I ever had!

Hi Stephanie my cake turned out very crumbly and kept falling apart. Do u know what may have caused this? 🤔 I followed all the measurements you had and used a tiny bit less sugar than 1 cup.
Best cake
i didnt have baking soda  so it turned out  not dat good ;(
Wow! This cake was amazing! It was so simple and easy and i made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I used the coffee which i think made the cake. 5 stars!

Love this recipe .also add 1 tsp instant coffee pwd .... mostly make cupcakes ..the best part is , in however rush u make it .. it just comes out perfectly delicious!!
Have this in the oven right now. Your site is one of my "go to" places for great baking ideas. I have made this cake several times and the only change I make is to add an eighth of a teaspoon of espresso powder. What a great recipe for when you only need dessert for a few people. (Your cocoa brownies are simply the best out there!) Thanks for all the inspiration.
Made cupcakes out of this recipe .... turned delicious ...  so soft texture !!!
The  cake was so tasteless not enough sweet  this by far was a very bad cake. I have tried many of your cakes and it had come out pretty well
I don't have vanilla any subsitutes
I made this twice and it's one of the best cake i've ever bake..so moist and delicious. My family loves it too. And I'm making this again on my daughter's birthday.

Hi Stephane..:) Loveeeeeeee your recipes.. Thank you for being such an inspiration!!  I've made your red velvet cake recipe a zillion times and must say, it's one of the BEST recipes that I've come across. This time however, I have a request to make it an eggless one - which I've never done before. Came across this video of yours and wondered if the same could be tweeked to make it an eggless "red velvet cake" instead - by adding red colour to the ingredients... As I need to give it out tomorrow, would really appreciate if your could let me know if it's possible... If not, could you suggest another way to do the same?  Thanks a ton for your help.:)
hello stephanie, I tried your this recipe , and another one , simple chocolate cake , and both of them turned out to be really delicious, so thanks a lot for your guidance regarding these, :-) I would like to know what should be the temperature and time  if i use a microwave instead of oven for baking?

Hi Stephanie, baked this cake today but it's not fluffy n chewy inside... Can you please tell me what went wrong... Thank you
I make this cake yesterday and it turned out GREAT. My only issue was the icing I used a good brand of semi sweet baking chocolate but it seemed a little bitter it seem to overpower the cake (which was great) should I try using the milk chocolate baking bars? The cake is not an overly strong chocolate cake (I guess that is what I like about it) I will be making this cake again!  Question why does the cake call for lemon juice.
no need to add eggs?
yummy
i tried your recipe.. it came out welll.... moist and spongy... just have one question can i add egg to it...
And can I add an egg?
Hi can i leave the lemon juice or vinegar out?

Hello ;-) Can I use whole wheat flour for this cake?
Hi there :) can i use a round 9 inch pan?
I made this cake a couple days ago and it was scrumptious!  Stephanie's right, its definitely a snacking cake, nothing fancy. Its not very chocolatey nor is it rich and decadent due to the lack of eggs. However, its incredibly moist and you can't beat the limited ingredient list.  Its a great "base" cake and I will make it again with a rich, fudge frosting!
She didnt put egg?

Got another question. What is the difference among these ganache recipes: First- Heating butter with cream in saucepan then pouring over chocolate. Second - Placing all three over simmering water. Third - Heating just choco and cream w/o butter. I'd also like to know what is best to put over cupcake (i like ganache for my cupcake). Thank you in advance!

I think the chocolate cake with some eggs but this is without
hi Stephanie, I ve been watching your recipes for a few weeks now. I made the American Sponge cake the same way you explained and it turned out super sponge and delicious. Just loved it! I m trying this recipe now, but I don't have baking soda only baking powder. Do you think I can go ahead? Please reply..
i love your recipes, everytime i try one it works, thank you :)
Hi Stephenie, what is the difference between chocolate fudge and chocolate cake?
hey there, i have learn alot from you infact all from you. keep up the great work... can you please please share the recipe of choclate fudge cake... or at least fudge icing ... plz
my fav!! so easy i have made this like 5 times!! thank you :)
I love using this recipe whenever I'm called upon to bake a cake at short notice, especially for cake sales at my kids schools. Simple, eggless and always a hit!
for those wanting to skip the lemon, just add vinegar instead, but you MUST have the acid to interact with the baking soda for the lift.  Dont try to use all baking powder (in fact MY recipe doesnt have baking powder at all) or you will get baseballs inside your cake heh.  If you trade the butter in for oil you will have "Wacky cake" or "chocolate depression cake" because this recipe (or one close to it) was invented by creative depression era bakers who couldnt get their hands on butter, eggs, or milk very often.  Of course we arent in such tough times, so adding a good buttercream frosting will take this cake right over the top.  My great grandmother passed this recipe down to us but there are thousands of references and derivations of it on the net to find.  Google Chocolate depression cake for a full sized 9x13 pan recipe of my top favorite rich, moist, chocolaty cake.
oil will give you a more moist result in this cake believe it or not.
we love your show
Could I use a 9 inch square pan?
Hi Stephanie, can I use Chocolate instead of a coco powder?
Interesting. Anyway, let me take this opportunity to say I've watched nearly all of your videos now and I've really enjoyed your channel over the past 12 months - very instructive and useful.
Correct this is an eggless recipe.
No eggs?
What is the best cake this one or the simple chocolate cake in terms of moisture nad taste? love your channel and have tried a lot of your recipes
Can I put baking powder instead of baking soda?
For convection ovens you need to lower the temperature stated in recipes by 25 degrees F (15 degrees C).
I have a convection feature on my oven that I've never used. Never sure of the time/temp adjustments. Are your times and temps for convection ovens?
Whats the difference between this recipe and the "simple chocolate cake". I want to make the pigs in mud chocolate cake. Which recipe would be better? Do they have different tastes or textures?
Wow...what a simple cake recipe..I definitely gonna try this..thank stephanie....you're life saver...
What Happens if you add eggs?
Hi Stephanie, that so nice reddish effect is obtained only with lemon and unsweetened cocoa powder, or other types of cocoa powder gain that red texture too?
hi stephanie, i love your recipes but there is a problem when ever i bake a cake or cupcake they turn out to be dense, heavy, they don't rise well and   have air in it and when i put them in the fridge it turns out to be very hard. what can i do to make a perfect cake
Hello Stephanie; I love your recipes and demonstrations.  I'd like to use the Dutch processed cocoa I have on hand. Do I need to adjust the recipe, and how would it affect the flavor?
Hi Stephanie, I was wondering if i could add an egg to the wet mixture.... Would you recommend this? and how do you think it'll turn out like?
Yummyyyy :)
You can just double the recipe if you want to make two layers.
Hi Stephanie, if I want to make a 2-leveled round cake (like the carrot cake) with chocolate fudge between the 2 layers and the ganache on top, do I have to double the recepe or add eggs or something? Sorry dfor the ignorance! By the way your carrot cake was deliciius!! Thank you so much for always adding Grams and mL, I couldn't do it without that!
I have made this for my kids they loved it thank you very make
I have GE Profile Convection Oven.
Butter does tend to add flavor to recipes.
Hello, thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I always try your recipes and they turn successful, but I'm not a fan of butter(I like to keep things lighter) so I always substitute Pure Wesson Canola Oil instead of the melted butter in all your recipes. This is the 4th time I make that cake with oil never did it with melted butter and it tastes great, so does the butter affects the cake's flavor? Doesn't it taste the same if I'm using flavorless oil? And thanks.
I'm sorry, but I really don't know as I've never tried leaving out the cocoa.
sorry i meant to ask was could i just leave out the cocoa and make this as vanilla  sponge?  thank u so much for this recipe.
I like this video,but I can not understand what you say,I know English not good         I
like this video!
like this video!!!!!! u really like 2 bake
I usually add a little olive oil to the batter, it gives the cake a more moist texture:)
You can use either a semi sweet or bittersweet dark chocolate.
Hi! Can I use bitter or dark chocolate for the ganache?
can i make this cake in a mug (cup)???
And bye the way i have to and have to have butter in my
Hey i tried with wheat flour and it was very heavy
Can we use wheat flour in this recipe..........if yes......does the quantity for other ingredients change?
Your videos are so simple to follow that just love the make your recipes. I've tried several of your recipes and have always succeded. THANK YOU SO MUCH for your teachings and the peace you transmit :))
Yes, you can use this recipe for a layer cake. I would double the recipe.
I've never tried it without the baking soda.
How much is a quarter cup of cocoa powder in grams?
hello! Can I use this recepie for cupcakes? And can I do this cake without cocoa?
Can I layer the cake?
thank you so much... by the way... I just love all your recipes... >:)...
Can I use evoporated milk instead of water
I've never tried it, but you probably could.
can I use oil instead of melted butter?...
Very nice video of yours, Thanks a lot ! I sure will try it later, but I am not sure of that Cream, what kind of cream ? Can I replace it by milk ? Maria from  HK.
i made this for my mom and besides she doesn't like eggs
Can I omit the lemon juice? I really don't like the sound of lemon juice with a chocolate dish. Would it be just as good if I left it out?
I've never tried it, but you should be able to use milk for the water.
can i add milk instead of water..
With vegan butter this is the perfect vegan chocolate cake! Melted vegan chocolate with vanilla soymilk on top instead of the ganache. Mhmmmm! Thanks!
Can I substitute Espresso for Vanilla and if I double the recipe can I bake in 9 X 13 pan?
I tried this today.turned out perfectly awesome.thanks a lot!!!
You probably could, as long as you don't mind the flavor of balsamic vinegar in a chocolate cake.
You could leave it out.
Sad really. I really wanted to try to bake something but I just really don't have most of the things!
Vanilla extract has alcohol in it so cant use it, what could i use instead?
made this , came out delicious <3 thank you luv
Yes this is an eggless recipe.
You didnt add egg??
Why did you add the water
This is an amazing recipe i loved it.. thank you so much for sharing it :)
That's strange and it's hard to say what the problem may be. Did you weigh your flour? If not, maybe you added a little too much flour.
I make it today but how come mind 1 it look more thick then ur 1 :-(:-( atfer u mix every thing up ???
Hi. Is it necessary to use BOTH baking powder and soda, or can you just use baking powder on its own?
HI Stephanie, My question is can I substitute the sugar with Splenda? will it change the density of the cake?
If I wanna make two 9 inch cakes, should I double the recipe or just leave it like that?
If I wanna make two 9 inch cakes, should I double the recipe or just leave it like that?
how much is a quarter of a cup in grams ?
Hello, can gluten free flour be used instead? these days you always have people with "special" requirements...(sigh) :-)  I do love your channel! Everything comes out so nice!
Correct, this recipe is eggless.
No eggs in this receipe????
Also can I opt the lemon  juice from the recipe and by any chance, would the flavor change?
Do you sift the flour before making the batter?
Try using coconut oil instead.
Thank you for this recipe, it looks delicious. By the way, I love your marble counters.
You mean exclude. She said that you don't have to add the butter, it just makes it smoother, I think I may leave it out also. I could hardly wait to make this , it looks so yummy, and so easy.
Many thanks! :-)
That should be okay. I would probably keep it at the same oven temperature and the baking time should be about the same.
Hi, can I bake the cake using a disposable aluminium tray?  Is there a need to adjust the oven temperature or baking time?
Because they are different ingredients that have different densities. Think about it this way, would one cup of feathers have the same weight in grams as one cup of rocks?
how is 1 and a half cup 195grms and 1 cup is 200grms
Looks delicious!!
Hi it's use boiling water,  that's mean is hot water?  I'm a bit confusing
Thank you so much for this recipe, looks so nice. Must try it, soooo easy.
I'm sorry, but I really don't know why your batter would be thick. There is 1 cup (240 ml) of water in the batter, so normally that would make it quite thin.
Hi,I tried to make this cake but I ended up with a really thick batter ,what could possibly have gone wrong ,,and what do you recomend I should do next time ???
Alright thank you so much
As you saw in the video, the batter for this cake is quite thin.
I love this cake, but my batter always comes out really liquid, and thin. What am I supposed to do?
I made this and my mom loved it! Thanks!
Yes. Sounds like a great idea.
Omg! I made this last night and it was sooooo good we me, hubby, and kids finished the whole thing, my diet went out the window lolol
This cake does not contain eggs.
Its looks good., But the  cake has no eggs ? I always see you. by Ana.
I've never actually tried using oil in this cake, so I really can't say. Sorry.
can I use vegetable oil instead of butter? is that a feasible option?
Do you have any cake/cupcake/cookies recipes that dont use butter or egg? My niece cant eat butter and eggs and I wish i could make her something she can actually eat. Thank you so much!
the coke looks so moist. :) definitely will try this recipe.
Tried this and gave it to my friend for her bday and evryone loves it. Will make it again today for my baseball team. Thanks Miss Stephanie...Ann from hong kong
in some countries it may be called bicarbonate of soda
I don't have baking soda.. what do I do
Can I use milk instead?
Yes, you could use a springform pan. Once the cake cools you can pour the ganache over the cake. You can take it out of the pan first, before frosting, if you want the ganache to run down the sides of the cake. Otherwise, you can leave it in the pan and pour the ganache over the top.
hi ms. jaworski,  i have really enjoyed your program so much so that i'll make this cake for my wife's birthday. i am planning to make in a round form with greased baking paper. my question: could i leave baked cake in form and pour ganache over the cake? when the cake plus the ganache cools down i would then remove the spring form. would that work and not mess up the cake? thanks again for your great teaching style!
Hi! May I ask is alright bake without egg?
Hi stephanie, i like ur recipes and even tried some but today its amazing to have  an eggless cake recipe. thanks for sharing
Its yummy!! But mine is too big Lol but still awesome and yummy
It takes about an hour to set. It doesn't really become hard.
Hi Stephanie, will this ganache set hard? Otherwise, how long does it take to set?
now i dont have to use eggs to bake when i run out of them!!
i just made two of this cake. i followed the recipe so blindly that i did not even realize that it doesn't contain eggs. after baking and leaving it cool, i remembered that i didn't add eggs. i ran to the cakes and sliced a piece to taste it. ohhhhhh man it is soooooo good. so light and fluffy. thank you sooooo much. i wil make another 3 and use it for the school bake sell. they will love it. .
Unfortunately, if you use a different size pan than what is recommended in a recipe, the baking time varies. But the baking temperature will stay the same.
is chocolate cake the same with mud cake?
hi... can u plz tell me wht is shortening and what is it used for?
Yes, you could use this batter for cupcakes.
Can you use this for cupcakes?
This type of cake is not as fluffy as a regular butter cake. One reason is the mixing of the batter. The other reason is that it doesn't contain eggs.
will this be a fluffy cake without eggs in it.. please reply.. :)
This is a more casual type of cake. One that you cut straight from the pan. I don't think I would use it for a layered cake.
Hi im so going to try egg free cake, having the allergy to eggs makes it hard and fancy a chock cake in stead of my plan egg free sponge. And to those who wantn to know will it work in a small oven, yes I think it will.
I'm sorry, but I really don't know.
will it work if I use the small oven? like the American Home microwave oven? the small one? please reply :(
microwave only? :(
No that would not work.
can i use rice cooker instead? please reply. :)
Baking soda is normally used when there is an acidic ingredient in the recipe. This cake doesn't rise as much as some other types of cakes because of the way the batter is mixed (you aren't beating a lot of air into the batter) and also because it doesn't contain any egg.
hello, may i know how to prevent it from cracking? i bake exactly the time given, no overbaking. i tried twice but it still crack..
how much is this little cake weights? i would like to make a 1 kilogram cake so i need bigger amounts of the ingredientes,,
First I would like to thank you for this channel!  I have already made your Key Lime Pie recipe and it is a hit every time! This chocolate cake looks amazing!!!  So easy!!  Due to having sugar sensitivities I have been trying to make your recipes with out sugar.  Do you have any recommendations on how to achieve this?  Right now I make apple tarts and pies with monkfruit and a touch of Agave (yeah I know it has sugar) and it is pretty good.  Any advice you have would make it awesome!!
You don't need the frosting.
Can I use this batter to make cupcakes?
hi please can you explain me the difference of regular unsweetened cocoa and dutch processed?  Also , when you use chocolate - which brand of dark chocolate and semi dark chocolate do you use?
Since the butter is melted, you should be able to use oil. I've never made it this way, so I'm not sure whether you would need the same amount or not.
Yes, you could use milk.
could i substitute water for milk to give it a richer flavour ?
I made this and it was so so good!! Thank you!! Easy and quick!
I made this for my husband about a year ago. Now it is his favorite. It is now our go to recipe for most occasions. Thanks.
I can use vegetable oil instead of butter? If possible, how much?
thank you
Not sure how an egg would affect the texture. It's not something I've ever tried.
what if I put an egg into?, I've never made one before:(
That is correct, this is an eggless recipe.
there are no eggs in the recipe?
what oven did you use
Probably eggs... And actual chocolate !
If you used a larger pan, the cake layer would be quite thin.
could i use 9x13 pan?
Is this like a chocolate birthday cake?
Can I add two eggs to this recipe?
Yes, it is a moist cake.
This is a more casual, where you leave cake in the pan and just cut it into squares.
is this moist?
since my mom is allergic to eggs i searched for choc cake recipes w/o eggs and found this one. i made the cake right after i watched ur video and it turned out great! thank you so much! :)
Hi...how would you get that cake out after the ganache has set? Thanks
Yes, this cake doesn't have any eggs in it.
No eggs?
You can always get the written recipe on our website. There is a link in the description.
you know what i would like you to do is put up the recipe before you start baking for people who would like to bake along with you it would be easier great demo thou.
can you tell me the secret / tips of cake baking for the large product (to be a supplier)
Is that any problem if i add some mango flavour into the cake?
can you tell me how much more recipe u need for full sized oven baking sheets
I just did this and im about to taste!
Can baking powder substitute for baking soda? And can I use melted chocolate instead of cocoa powder?
I've never tried that, but you should be able to use the batter for cupcakes.
veri nyc and delelisues i makeit this  cake......,can i use this ingredints for cup cakes?
it's lovely.. thanks a lot for such easy recipe.. :D
Do you have a choclate cake recipe that's fluffy like a cupcake?
Because there isn't an egg in this cake, the texture is a little different than other cakes.
I've used your site extensively for muffins and they turn out great. Tried this cake, though I halfed the recipe (since we are only 2 of us). The cake tasted alright but in texture was more like a brownie, a little compact rather than fluffy. Any idea/tips? Is it because of halving the recipe. Pls let me know
U have used square ones  can i use circle and speard the butter plz can u give the ans
Yes, you could add chocolate chips.
Hiya Steph! Could i add chocolate chips in the mixture?
yesterday i tried your recipe. It's delicious and so easy to bake.Super quick!!!!!
I tried your this recipe today and it turned out very delicious. If i don't want to make chocolate flavour, how should i change the measurements?
i used your recipe and it is missing something. not sure what just yet. it was a little weird. i dont mean to be rude i am sorry if it seems that way. i love your videos.
Frosting looks really nice:)
I've never tried it, but you could use the same amount of oil.
Yes, you could use Dutch processed.
Yes, you could add some almonds.
can i add almonds ?? wont affect the cake or is not a good idea?? thankss
is it okay if i used dutch-processed? your recipe calls for unsweetened cocoa, but i don't have it available right now with me
I don't think it really affects the taste.
because there is no egg in this recipe , how does it affect the taste? please reply, love your recipes
Yes, it's still available.
It is a Kenwood Titanium Chef KM010. I bought it on ebay a few years ago.
There isn't any egg in this recipe.
no egg?
I've never done that, but I would think you could.
thank you very much for this recipe. it is very easy to follow and make it delicious even though this is my first time cooking cake.
Thank you very much for your answer. Regards from Iceland :)
Yes, you can use a larger pan, but the baking time would be shorter. I've never made it in a larger pan, so I'm not sure exactly what the baking time would be.
Hello Stephanie :) I would like to ask you about the square cake pan 8 inch (20 cm) that you baked the cake in. My question is, could I use a bit bigger cake pan and get the cake then a little thinner?? And if so would you recommend less baking time??
Would like to try this cake but can't imagine what it will be like made with water and no eggs - very unusual !
thanks stephanie ,gonna try cake tom ...thanks a ton
350F or 180C. You can always get all the information on the recipe including the temperature on our website. There is a link to the recipe in the description.
at wht  temp i am supposed to bake
Bicarbonate of soda is the same thing as baking soda, that is the name used in some countries.
Hi..do I have to use the lemon?
The baking soda leavens the cake so I wouldn't leave it out.
Correct this recipe does not call for eggs.
Hi  So there is no egg?
Thank you for sharing this recipe, best cake I ever made and everyone wanted an extra slice to take home.
i reduced the oven temperature and made the cake again. it came perfect. Thank you!
I'll use milk then!
Yes you could use milk.
I've never tried it, but you should be able to use this recipe to make cupcakes.
instead of water can i use milk???
Could I use this recipe for make cupcakes?
Today I made this cake and my family love it!!! Thanks for sharing your wonderfull recepies!!!
suuuperr easy n it tasted deliciousss!! thank u soo much!!
There are a few things that could cause this. One reason for cracking is that the oven temperature is too hot. You could buy a free standing oven thermometer to double check your oven's calibration.
Hi! i tried baking this cake twice. It came nice and soft..... but only cracked on the top.... can u please let me know what mistake am i making.
You want to bake the cake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
my cake turned out very soft and moist..t its too moist towards the ends..is that okay?? I poured the icing over it..going to gift it to someone.. :) so i dont get to eat it :D
Yes, although the baking time may be a little longer.
may i use a round 8 inch tin cos i dont have a sqaure?? :)
No, it should be baked all the way through. Sounds like your oven temperature may be too low. I would try buying a free standing oven thermometer to double check your oven's calibration.
Baking powder consists of baking soda, one or more acid salts (cream of tartar and sodium aluminum sulfate) plus cornstarch. Most baking powder used today is double-acting. Baking soda or bicarbonate of soda (sodium bicarbonate) is about 4 times as strong as baking powder and is mainly used in recipes that have an acidic ingredient.
I dno why but the bottom part of the cake was not cooked properly even though a toothpick inserted did come out clean.. I baked as mentioned. when i eat it, it sticks to the roof of my mouth. is it supose to be like that?
whats the difference between baking soda and baking powder?? I thought they were the same thing..
The reason it turned out that way is the recipe needs the baking soda, it is not optional.
This reminds me of a recipe I found about 30 years ago called 'Wacky Cake'. My mother commented back then that she wished they had it in the war when eggs were rationed. I lost that recipe and am glad to find one like it, but that recipe didn't have butter.
If you leave out the baking soda, you won't get as much rise from the cake.
I usually place it in the center of the oven.
This recipe is fantastic!!! It seems so easy to make. Thanks for sharing!!! I should put the cake in the middle of the oven or in the buttom?
Never use the top for baking, only the bottom.
My oven has top heating as well as bottom. Do I keep both on while baking this cake?
I've never tried using oil, but you should be able to use it.
This is the best recipe for chocolate cake . Thanks.
Hi Stephanie, I'm a chef living in Greece. Just wanted you to know, that I've been making your carrot cake the past 2 years now, and let me tell you, its a hit! I've had about a dozen people ask me to make one for them, parties, engagement party, e.t.c. Friends of mine basically. Your awesome!
I've tried it today, it's really delicious and very easy to make! upload more videos please,. I'm really inspired to bake more because of you guys! Thank you! :)
This is a casual everyday cake that is meant to cut into squares directly from the pan. I've never actually tried to remove the whole cake from the pan.
Thank you, for your great demos.
how can i remov cake in tre? i make today but i cant remov,and i wannt to wraith some name but i cant remov the cake. please riply thanku.
Correct, this is an eggless recipe.
No egg?
I don't have baking soda, so I did bake without baking soda and the result is good :)
This cake turned out really good, but it wasnt too soft. Still tasted great. Thanks for the recipe!
The baking soda helps to give the cake a nice rise. I've never made it without it, so I'm not sure how it would be.
Is it ok if i dont put in baking soda?
this cake is amazing i made it 4 time in the past 10 days
I tried yesterday .it was great and taste wonderful .Great recipe Thanks joy of baking !Thanks Stephanie !
I've never made a ganache with milk chocolate. You would probably want to use less cream if you were to make a milk chocolate frosting.
I always leave it in the pan and just cut a slice.
Can I use milk chocolate for the Frosting ?
Thank you for the video Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. How do you tip the cake out of the tin. Since there is icing on it?
350 deg F 175 deg C. You can always find all the information on the recipe including the temperature on our website. There is a link to the recipe in the description above.
can you save me some later pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee you better save some for me!
I've never tried doing that, but it should be okay.
if i add one egg will it be ok ?
can i change warm water to warm milk and remove the white vinegar/lemon,
Wow will make it soon
Thanks for sharing awesome recipes :) I recently found you on Youtube and made some of your recipes already. My husband loved them. Thank you so much once again!!!

How many eggs did you add?

i wish you would also serve and taste!!
IT LOOKS SO NICEE

super easy .:)
hi, this cake was so delisious!! i wanted to make a chocolate cake, and choosing this recipe was probably the best choice ive made in baking. thank you
this recipe does not use eggs?
We love your comments however due to our busy schedule questions on the recipes may take some time. We check our﻿ Facebook page more often so if you would like a quicker answer post your question there. A﻿ link to our Facebook page is in the description above.
You will smell the baking soda reacting with the lemon juice (or vinegar) as it bakes. This, however, does not affect the flavor of the chocolate cake.
