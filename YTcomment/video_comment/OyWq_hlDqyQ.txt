What happened to the foam washer?
Hi, Phil. How do you remove the flange/drain? Do I require a tub drain remover tool or should it just pop out from the sink? Thanks!
Hi Phil. Excellent video! Thanks for posting. I have one very similar to this which is comparatively new but the pop-up mechanism has suddenly stopped pushing up the plug to open it. Although there is still up and down movement against the spring, the plug doesn't lock in either position. Is there an adjustment that can be made? Have you any ideas abourt this?
I have a sort rubber flat washer and no flat plastic does it matter?
Do I need to align anything for the overflow?
You have the wrong drain for that basin, and don't admit this till you answer a post above. Your one is for a basin with an overflow. You would have been aware of this when making the video, ad it would have failed massively.
Does this catch hair?
What brand name was this item?

Thorough and concise! Thanks
Exactly what I was looking for- thank you!
Thanks
Short sweet and to the point!  Thank You.
I have a question: I have this style stopper in my bath sink. Can I pull the stopper out? I need to clean just under where  it closes, on top of the flange, but can't get to all of it with the stopper in place.
What did you do about the push part on the faucet? Did you just leave it there? I don’t want to change my faucet, but I’m wondering if I need to use a little silicon to hold down the push that operates the lift rod? Thanks!
Where does the overflow holes align to?
Thanks so much - should have been simple to install but I had the washer upside down adn was leaking - could not figure it out until I watched your video - appreciated!
