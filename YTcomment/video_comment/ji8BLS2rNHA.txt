How is a row of joined blocks joined ?
Thank you again 🎉🎉❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Perfeito! Maravilha! Todo o video é muito bem feito. Muito didático . Obrigada ❤
I love this playlist ❤
Perfectly accurate method for my quilt blocks!👍 Thank you for sharing! Best wishes from Bavaria, Germany!❤️❤️
Thank you for the easy to follow video
Beautiful
So good
this quilt is beautiful, thank you for the video
Thanks. I can't wait to try this technique 😊
I love this tutorial and have used it in the past. I have a question that I hope I can explain.  My blocks have points.  If I cut the front sashing at 2 inches (1 inch when folded), will the points get covered up?   Should I cut the front sashing at 1.5 inches (3/4 inch folded) and the back sashing at 3/4 inch?   Thanks so much!
EXCELLENT!!
Thank you again. I’ve always come back to your video many times to show me how to add sashing on a “quilt as you go” quilt! You make it so easy to understand. 👏👍🌷
Thank you so much- I’ve got two quilts worth of appliqué butterflies and hearts and can’t face having to appliqué individually- so block quilting is perfect- thanks to your great instructions I now know how I will do this- thanks again/ blessing.
Tell it where it belongs.
❤❤❤❤❤
Very well explained!!! Thanks!
Very much enjoy your humor! I wouldn't get a quilt done if I had to hand stitch either. Thank you for the wonderful video.
Where can i get instructions for adding 3 inch sashing  between my QAYG blocks?
I come back to your tutorial every time I do QAYG.
this is the first time i've understood the technique - thanks for your video!
Thanks for the info 👍 good job 😊
Lovely colourful quilt and great tutorial 💞
I hope you are doing well.  You have helped me immensely with my quilting.  Thank you so much,
I keep coming back here because I love this method. Thank you ❤
Love it!  Very colourful!  I’m going to try it with my squares……
Thank you! I have watched this video over the years so many times.  But now in my OLD age I need simpler was to assemble a quilt and I like this!!!!!  Can’t wait to try it after all these years!  😊
Thank you for your clear instructions.  😀
Thank you for the very clear instructions. I love QAYG but could not come to grips with joining them. Now I can complete a few quilts. Again thank you.
I most definitely will be doing this process. I find that I don’t feel positive about my quilt making, because I really haven’t learned it properly and I don’t make any larger quilts than a lap quote because they’re very hard to handle. So this Quilt, as you go, I think will help me andchange my outlook for the new year 2024. I hope you’re well. I pray you’re well and please put more videos on. Thank you merry Christmas and a happy blessed new year.
Thank you for this great tutorial! I am preparing to start my first quilt as you go project and this is by far the best tutorial I have seen for joining my individually quilted squares!
what a gorgeous quilt. love the colours and the tutorial was great. I am a beginner and i have struggled to find a good video on sashing the qayg
Great tutorial!!  Every thing makes sense now! Thank you
I’ve been using up all my scraps and bits of batting to make some 6.5 inch squares and free up some space in my sewing room. How to stitch them together was going through my mind the whole time, but I had a light bulb moment and remembered The Gourmet Quilter had a video on the process (I actually remembered the striped backing strips 😂). Thank you Susan-Claire, I’m confident I can sew my 99 squares together!
Wonderful video. Very creative quilt. Thank you
Is there a written pattern for this quilt? It’s really a nice quilt.
Your videos are what started me quilting! I watched them over and over....Thank you!!!
Excellent tutorial. I just used it to join 4 prequilted squares. Thank you.
this should work joining a puff quilt block also
Beautifull thanks
Love the quilt, beautiful colours ❤
Thankyou for sharing your video, your method of quilt as you go is the easiest one I've come across thankyou once again ❤
Beautiful ❤️
Thank you Susan. I’m just about to put my quilt as you go together for my granddaughter and I really needed this set of videos many thanks from the uk.
I’m glad I found this tutorial. Now I can put my blocks together easily!!!
A great looking quilt!  I'll need to try a practice run with this method! Thank you!
aha so thats how it is done
Amazing
Such a beautiful, colourful quilt!!
Thanks a million for such sweet and clear directions!
I can’t believe I found your video again after 7 years! I made one of these for my granddaughter and 7 years later I was beyond excited when I was visiting her to find that she still has it ❤️.  I’m in the middle of a sewing funk and I’m going to dig out some Christmas fabric and make another one 😊
Just rewatched this video. You are a great teacher, nice & clear and well illustrated. Think this will save my dodgy arms and hands 😉
This is SOOOO helpful and well explained to help me finish the quilt I'm making for my granddaughter's double-digit birthday!!  Thank you so, so much!!
You are so talented and a wonderful teacher. Thank you so much! Your quilt is gorgeous!
This is amazing! Thank you for showing us how to do this
best instructional!!! Thank you.
So simple!  Thank you thank you!
Many thanks for sharing tbis method! I'll be trying it soon!
I'm so glad I found you! As an 'older' quilter, who's fingers don't quite work like they used to, your tips and tricks have allowed me to keep going with my hobby! Thank you for all of your video's!
Great tutorial😊🌻👏
Excellent demo! Love it! ❤
Do we still square up the blocks?
This is wonderful! Thank you!
Can you help please with some advice? I have joined 6 blocks together and made a row, now to join the rows together, it is quite lengthy and the fabric isn't long enough to cover one end to another so can I join small pieces together to make 1 long piece? Thank you for a reply.
Is there a part two? How do you join rows?
Thank you  very much. Now i understood and will try. I have 20 blocks to quilt as i go. Have a nice weekend Ms Susan Clair
Thank you. This is a great method. Instruction done well!
Thank you for your concise instructions that take the mystery out of joining QAYG blocks.
How wide is this stashing on the back. I heard you say the front was 2 1/4. This is a wonderful video. Thank you but I don’t know how big the back sashing is.
Thank you for a wonderful tutorial.  It was so easy to understand and follow your instructions!  I just finished a king-size tee shirt quilt using your method.  I had been putting it off for many years because I wasn’t sure how I could machine quilt it as a whole.  This way I quilted each square and then joined them together.
Never tried this method of quilting before but thank you for such a good, clear video showing how to join my blocks.
I love your tutorials, they are so easy to understand. Thank  you for sharing!
Wow!!  Your video was concise and easy to follow.  I have watched a number of them and there are different ways but this one was wonderful!!  Thank you so much for explaining this in a no-nonsense way.  I have 4 quilt tops I made YEARS ago and wanted to quilt them on my embroidery machine.  It isn't big enough but I can quilt my blocks that I have made for a snowman quilt this way and I am thrilled that I can save this and watch it.  Kudos!!!
Can I still do this technique with wider sashing strips, 1 1/2 or 2 1/2 inches?
Thanks great instruction.  I made lots of string quilt blocks..new to quilting..and I did not know how to sew a different solid block..my scrappy quilt is eye crazy..
Thank you so much.  This is the best explanation and video I have seen
Thanks a million.    I’ve got a vintage sewing machine that does not drop feeddogs or have a walking foot.   That’s really vintage.    So with the right tools QAG is doable 🌻
What a super method and great, clear tutorial. Thank you for making this video!! I haven't tried QAYG blocks, but as I now live in a tiny travel trailer, I thought it would be a better idea LOL. Thank you!
Thank goodness this is still up after nine years! Excellent tutorial. Thanks so much for the clear explanation. I was struggling with QAYG until I stumbled upon this.
I’ve been looking for something like your process. Thank you for sharing it so clearly!
Thank you, this video makes it much easier.
I Really love the way you explained and do the sashing for QAYG!!! The best I've seen so far! I'm ready to machine sew the blocks for my son's quilt. Then I'll do your technique for the sashing! Thank you so very much!
What a fun and colorful quilt! Wonderful video!
Finally a quyg block attachment I believe I can do! Very new to quilting so thank you
Really helpful
I've wanted to try quilt-as-you-go for years, but the joining-up videos I've seen go out of their way to make the process SOOOOO complicated! HOWEVER, your wonderful video demonstrates a no-nonsense/no-fuss process that is easy to understand, and hopefully easy to emulate! 😊 At long last, I may be able to try my hand at free-motion quilting on a small scale to get good practice, and still have a useable larger quilt to enjoy when all is said and done! Thank you so much, from Virginia USA! And oh, your quilt looks fabulous!!! 🇺🇸😺💕🐾
thank you
Love it - great method!
Thank you!I was told block by block is too much work!!!I think it's way easier especially for large projects
Your a genius sewer
I just finished a kings size quilt doing it this way. It looks so nice! I'm so proud of how it turned out. Thanks again🥰
I have never been able to quilt a quilt as easy as this!! Thank you so uch for making this. I just love you for it🥰
Can you show joining the horizontal joining
Oh my goodness. I almost gave up on quilting as i dont have a specific quilting machine and i found working with very large items and trying to free motion any whole quilts impossible. NEVER AGAIN. QAYG just made sense. This method is a game changer for me so thank you so much.
OH, MY this is Fantastic!  Thank YOU!
That is one beautiful quilt!  I loved it!
back again, for a refresher to YOUR method.   So many ideas from many quilters.  I've used this technique for MANY QAYG string quilts.  You do a GREAT job in your presentation.  Thank you again, over the years, for clear demo.
You have an artist's eye when it comes to selecting colors that look beautiful together. Excellent instructions.
Thankyou for sharing I love it
Can you tell me how wide your sashing strips are for each side. It looks like one inch.......your method is the easiest one I have watched and I have viewed many. Thanks.
Thank you so much, I know this video is old but I keep watching it to remind me on how to join mym blocks, for me it does not get old, it's the best tutorial Iv'e seen.
I want to thank you how detailed and accurately you explained in detail how to put my quilted squares together. I looked and looked and couldn’t find a video that gave me the confidence to actually put the squares together. It’s been months and now I have done it with your excellent tutorial. Thank you for taking the time to show me and all the quilters out there. Janet from Oregon, USA
Great instruction, new to quilting so following you closely.  Thank you ❤️
I only have one question. when you join rows, haven't you already closed part of the ends of blocks when you joined squares up? So, then how do you get the quarter inch seem down the back strip only? Isn't there stitching you'd have to go over or pick out?
Looks hard
Thank you for sharing this wonderful demonstration
This is a great video.  I have some quilt as you go blocks done and have been trying to figure out how to join them into a bigger quilt without having obvious bulky seams.  So glad I found this tutorial so I can now complete my project.  Thanks!!!
I LOVE IT I REFER TO YOUR VIDEOS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
A soon as I heard " not really a pin person"......Subscribed.
Thank you
Thank you so much for your videos.  I have learned so much from you. Please keep posting videos.
Hi. Hello. Howdy. Thank you for sharing.
Good tutorial.  I just finished all my blocks.  How did you decide to quilt the blocks?  Mine are just scrap blocks. Should I sew along the strips and squares I sewed together or is there a better way? Thanks, Kathy from MO
Lovely.. ty ty! Starting to tackle this!
So lovely! Thanks very much for the tutorial.
I love watching your demonstrations.  There is always something to learn!
Superbe. C'est comme ça que je vois le patchwork. Ce modèle est très riche en couleurs et en images. Merci 😃 j'aimerais avoir d'autres. Bravo 👏
Love this!! So easy and easy to understand!! I especially loved when she said if it were going to be hand quilting it would never get finished. HAND is a 4-letter word after all.
Best "Quilt as you Go" tutorial I've seen yet.  Thank you.
I discovered your video a few years ago and I've done a handful of quilts with the QAYG method you taught.  I'm doing a quilt now that I want 1" finished sashing so I wonder if I should put an inch of batting since the seam allowance will not fill half of that sashing.  What do you think?
Thank You SO much for this video 🥰
One very useful tutorial for joining pieces. Could apply the technique when making a table cloth from large scraps,but without the batting, of course.. Thanks for sharing your tips and suggestions for sewing lovers.. God bless and much love from Malaysia..
Thank you so very much for this tutorial!!!!!!  I am a beginner and I want to make my grands ( 4 weeks old and 1 due in June) each a quilt.  This tutorial helps so much!!!!!!!!!!
beautiful colors ty 4 ur video ur teachings ty
Thankyou.
Wow, this is great!  I love the quilt and the method and especially your very clear instructions.  Going to try to apply this method to a lot of my quilting.  So much easier than wrestling with the entire quilt.  Thank you.🤩
Terrific teaching. So helpful! MERCI!
Thank you!  This is the best video I’ve seen for Quilt as you go🥰
Thank you I’m going to try this. Great instruction.
Question if my squares are flannel. Will it work to use cotton for slashing?
This is an ingenious and fun technique! I thank you 😊
Love your videos!  Thanks so much!
This is wonderful. I'm a new quilter and qayg is the way that makes quilting enjoyable for me. Thank you for this tutorial.
How would this be done on a black and white checkered quilt as you go please there are no videos on my question
Thank-You😀 I'm working my blocks and I was worried about the next steps..beautiful❤
Great tutorial thank you, coukd you please let me know if I can get this pattern,  I'd love to make it
Such lovely vivid colours in your quilt, it’s beautiful, very good idea how to put the blocks together it looks very neat. This will be my next project. I’m new to quilting, I’m on my first quilt, straight for a king size ! The batting and backing fabric is next, wish me luck, never done it before, but I like a bit of a challenge. Thank you for your tutorial.
If I were to use flannel blocks would I use flannel strips or cotton? Love your video
Excellent turorail. I'm going to give it a go x
Love your tutorials, you are such a good teacher.  Thanks for sharing.
Wow! Thank you for sharing. I am excited to try this. You have clear directions and showed every step in detail. It is what I was looking for. You made my day :)
What stitch length do you use to join the blocks? Nice technique! thanks
Just Beautiful can’t wait to start a quilt like this. You explain things so well. I am no expert at quilting but I could handle a block at a time. Winter is my sewing time and my time it coming soon.  Thanks
Hello, I was wondering if you made a video on how to cut/sew the square that has many pieces on the left?  Not sure how you made it a square from many strips.  Did you just sew lots of strips and then cut it on a square to form a perfect square with many pieces that you turned at an angle?  I hope you answer....thank you I just came across your channel
Many thanks 👏👏👏👏🌹🌹 for sharing your God given talent. you explain everything so easy. Thanks again 👍👍👍👍xx
Thank you for this wonderful video
Perfect, just what I was looking for, Thank you.
Wonderful technique. Thank you for posting and sharing.
Thank
Hi, tku for this video…how do you keep your strips & blocks match length the whole length?   Seems no matter  how much i pin lengths together they never finish the same…. I do use a walking foot. Tku.
I'm making 12" finished  QAYG blocks.  Can I ask how much fabric I would need for a quilt that has 48 blocks?  Thank you in advance.
That is beautiful! I am going to try and make a quilt as you go. Thank you for all of the information 😊
Great video. Beautiful quilt ❤️❤️❤️
amazing tutorial thank you!
Genius! Can't wait to try this method!
Beautiful great ideals, thank you
Wonderful this is what I was looking for
Have you ever used flannel  backing?  I want to make a QAYG quilt for my granddaughter and she wants flannel backing.
I'm with you about hand sewing would never get done!  Thank you for this tutorial!
Thank you so much 🙂
THank you for your instruction.  It was just what I was looking for as a newbie
Thank you
Thank you for your tutorials, I was able to make a king size quilt with your help. I did take notice that the quilt was heavier than other king size quilts. Is there a way to do this and make them lighter?
So how wide is the sashing on the front?
Fantastic video, thank you so much.  I’m digitizing my quilt blocks for our RV bed right now and I want to put it together using this method.  You’ve demonstrated it perfectly, so thank you!
Absolutely love  this quilt! By far the best demo I've seen. Thank you.
Thank you . I’m not started yet BUT picking up the things to start this helps a lot ....💞
Thank you so much for making the videos, I  have found your videos to be a blessing. Thank you so much!;-)
Sei molto molto brava 🤩 grazie
Brilliant. I love your choice of colors, front and back.
Thank you for this easy to understand video. I am new to quilting and and appreciate each video.
It's gorgeous
Beautiful quilt
I have my blocks made and quilted. So happy to see how to put it together. Thank you for explaining to make it easier to finish my quilt.
You are so talented, I enjoy your videos the most and have learned so many valuable tips.  Thanks so very much, you are fantastic!
This is the simplest video I have seen for showing how to do this technique.I think it’s time for me to try it.Thank you for showing this so simply.
This is the technique I use for all my quilts now. I found instructions in a magazine years ago. However I do mine a little different. I cut my strips 1 1/8 and 1 5/8 and do not fold the top one in half but have the edge next to the seam and press. I would add some photos of mine but don’t see how.
Great technique, I am excited about this, Thank you so much.
Thank-you, that was very clear.  I haven't actually quilted a top yet, though I have made a few quilt tops.  Just what I needed to know.  I had thought about q-a-y-g, but got discouraged about the borders.  You have my problem solved.  All the best.
Thank you so very much for a great tutorial.  I am working on my first quilt, an Illusion Quilt.  I want to have 2 inch sashes between each block.  Can that be done and if so, do I need to allow for batting in between?
Love the videos.  Did I miss one for adding the binding?
You are an excellent teacher!
This is what I’ve been looking for, you explain clearly and simply. As I work on a vintage Singer, I wanted a method to break a quilt down to quilt at home. Thanks.
I've been worrying how to join my squares,  the tutorial explains it very clearly and now I can't wait to try it!
Thank you. What a fabulous looking quilt!
Could you do a T-shirt quilt this way?
This was perfect! ❤ I've been looking for a good video for guilt as you go and this one was explained so clearly. Thank you for sharing! 🙂
Thankyou
You are such a great teacher.   I’m designing a Christmas Dresden Plate lap quilt for my daughter and just connected the first two squares. Perfect.    So much better than wrestling a big bulky quilt under my little sewing machine. Win-win: The contrasting connecting stripe adds a lot to the design.  Can’t thank you enough.
Genius! Thank you for this video, expertly explained.
Thank you so much for your clear concise teaching technique. I used it on my recent block of the month project and it worked out great. I’m definitely hooked!!  Appreciate your help. THANk YOU 💗
👍🏻
your method was the best and so easy to follow from the rest of the tutorials.t hank you
👋 😍 Hi am new here am so glad and thankful to you, am going to try this
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  I've been searching for just the right method to join the blocks that I've made and you have provided it!  Bless you!
Excellent tutorial. Thank you for sharing.
Very nice! Thank you for sharing.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Thé ribbon that you sew on the backing, is that a ribbon that you bought like this or is it a part of a yard of fabric that you cut yourself?? That the first time I see that and it is marvellous!
I have watched the Horizontal blocks being put together and matching is easy. But when it comes  to do the vertical blocks, how does one line up the horizontal one's while putting the stripes across the vertical, I find this very tricky. Their must be an easier way to do this bit?
I have watched many MANY QAYG tutorials....I have to say that yours is the very best....the easiest to understand and to follow!!  Thank you for being so precise and not rushing.....this is perfect!
Many thx. I love the way you demonstrated  quilt as you go with strips. You made it  look so uncomplicated. I tried it on a baby quilt about a year ago..was so proud of myself.. so thx to you again.. So talented.  God Bless .
Thank you!!!! I was stressing making my latest quilt and this has helped me tremendously!!!
I’ve been following you step by step today on joining my first qayg squares! Thanks so much! And love this quilt! Would love to know how you went about purchasing the material for this one. I assume the border material is what you matched up all the rest to, but how you go about deciding how many different fabrics and how much of each, when making such a varied piece? Just beautiful!
Thank you for your great explanation!
Thank you for this share, very good tutorial :))
What a bright and beautiful quilt. You do such nice work!... Hope I get brave enough to try this someday!
Thank you! I am new to quilting and just finished a quilt-as-you-go baby blanket that turned out way too small. Your video was the best I could find on how to add panels to my project to make it larger. Appreciate you SO much!
Thank you so very much!!!  I have tried different ways of doing quilt as you go, but your way is the best!!!  I just tried it today for the first time and will only do it your way from now on.  Thanks for sharing.
Thanks  my first  time quilting  your Tutorial  was a great  help
I have ripped my blocks apart at least 5 times because of the seam lines not lining up on the back of the quilt when i do the front sashing 😭😭 i didn't know it didn't matter if they were off..  Ive just started sewing in lock down
Thank you for sharing, I was afraid to join my squares but now I can tackle my project; I also recommended this video to my co worker, he also sews / quilts 🙏🏼 we are both novice quilters and enjoying the journey!
This is so helpful! 👍 I have a very small seeing space and this is how I'm going to put together my next quilt.
Thank you for a great refresher!  Great.
Brilliant and beautiful!
Muchas gracias por su hermoso trabajo. Me pueda decir que medidas tienen las telas que usó para unir los bloques? Por favor, muchas gracias. Tal vez alguien me pueda ayudar, no entiendo el inglés, me guío por las imágenes. Gracias.
I finished that baby quilt to a twin sized quilt!  You're techniques worked well!  I just changed the back stripe to 1.25" and the top to 2.25 to go with my walking foot better.    I first preshrunk all the material  and I choose a poly batting.  I Had to redo the first piece because it was thinner than the original...   The clerk at the fabric store thought she reccommended the right batting... Oh well.  I was able to fix it with another bag of batting and two more layers.  I just used my walking foot to quilt the sections in a gentle wave pattern.  Looks beautiful! Thanks so much for creating this video!
big thanks... clear practical excellent
Thank you for your video. Could you explain a little more about what to do if you are hand sewiñg your blocks.  How. do you do it iñ reverse. Can you show a video on this. Thank you
Thank you! This is the best tutorial that I found. I have all the pieces done and wanted to add the bordering for the first time. This will help me.
Thank you for your clear and thorough description and demo of how to construct a QAYG quilt. I don't have a lot of space to sew, so creating a double or queen size quilt was prohibitive. Now I can imagine how it may be doable. Yay! So happy I found your video.
My dear teacher, you are one of the people who make the world a better place! Thank you for sharing your wisdom in such a sweet kind manner. In every quilt I make I use some of your techniques. God bless!
Thank you. You tutorial helped me out.
That is one of the most beautiful quilts I’ve ever seen, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!  Grandson # 4 is coming in November, this is the quilt I’m making  him!❤️❤️❤️
👏👏👏🙂👍👍👍🌺🌹💐
WOW!  This is great!  A friend asked me to enlarge a crib blanket to a twin size and I've been wondering how to put the pieces together.  THis will work!  THanks so much for taking the time to create this video and your willingness to teach others.  Much appreciated!
Thank you so much for this. I know this is an old video but would you take the trouble to show how to add the borders?
my next project
that is the cutest quilt ever.
Thank you
Luv method
Great idea for making a quilt on a smaller sewing machine. Thank you.
I see that this video is from a few years ago but I have just found it. I really think you have made the process appear simple to do...I have always wondered how it was done. Thank you so much!!
thank you!  I was able to add a border to a quilt using this technique.
Thank you! I’m at the point where I need to put all my blocks.
Bellissimo lavoro!
This is brilliant.  I'm on my sixth or seventh quilt using your method.  You can use the same fabric on the back and the joining pieces almost disappear or have contrasting joining pieces.  It's really just open to how you want it to be.  Thank you for the information.  I come back and review your information whenever I start a new quilt
Hey Susan!  Just wanted you to know how helpful your method of joining quilted squares together was for me.  I made a Christmas quilt with 12 squares that were 14.5" finished.  The blocks are hand applique with lots going on.  I needed to quilt them individually and then the quilt was already large for any of my walls.  This method allowed me to show separation of my blocks without adding size.    Thanks for sharing.
I am new to patch work and quilting - I note you use 9.5 inch square.  I am just wondering why this size when it could be easier to do a 10 inch square.  Oh yes, I wanted to say that your quilt as you go instructions are fantastic!  thank you
Can you tell me how much fabric I will need to make the strips, I have never made a quilt and this will be my first.
Thanks love from Holland❤️
Very cute ☆
WOW ! Extremely helpful.. thanks teacher ! <3
I really enjoyed your description of joining the blocks together. I have seen other people but you made it mor e interesting and simplified the process
That was extremely helpful. Large quilts are difficult for me to quilt on my machine, but this will work. And I have some very delicious fabric.
beautiful
Your way is the best I've found. The others either don't look right or are too fiddly, or both.
This video is something that I refer to over and over. Thank you so much!
What a wonderful tutorial I stumbled upon here.  Thank you!
Ok, that is the best method and best tutorial for QAYG I have seen with sashing.  I think this will be my next quilt and that is adorable. I wonder if you can zig zag the raw edges under the binding ?? I think I would like that for less book fold on the joined blocks
Your quilt is beautiful and thank you so much I really enjoyed it, very helpful.
Genius!!
I know that you have adoring fans world-wide. Now you have one more. I have been sewing all my life but am bran new to quilting. My first quilting attempt produced loads of mistakes and buckets of tears. Then I found you. Your videos have served both as information and inspiration. You are absolutely amazing! Your ability to teach, explain, show, and tell all at the same time is nothing short of awesome. Best of all, your real love for the art shows through in every frame.  Thank you for your core mission of sharing the craft with those of us who need it most.
I see ur pfaff   The dual feed foot is a giveaway
Debbie , 25yrs not completing a quilt ? SMH.
THANK YOU I tried it, works great Did use a walking foot. Looks great. You are a great teacher enjoy watching.👍🙂
Thank you for your ideas. I have completed ten appliqué squares and was at a loss at how to join them . Now I'm excited to continue. Great!v
You are the best teacher, I can't believe how much I have learned from you, thank you very much for taking the time to share your skill and love for quilting, God bless you ma'am :)
That is so very pretty. Love ❤️ it. Thanks for sharing your video,,I will be back,,
I’ve heard of the qayg quilts before, but couldn’t imagine how the were joined.  Now it makes sense.  I think it would be so much easier for me to make my quilts this way.  I’m not very good at quilting on the machine due to the large size, but I could do a bock easily.  Thank you for sharing.
Want to give this fun quilts a go. It looks really cool. Great for attacking the stash box. Super😘😘👍🏻💁🏻
Thank you very much for this video. I have just discovered your site and think it is wonderful.
This is the best video and instruction on how to. This one makes sense.
Thank You!
Every time I have a new quilt to piece together I come back to this video, my very own refresher workshop. I recommend your channel to all the new quilters comong along too, you are so clear and easy to follow and never boring. Thank yiu so much for sharing your skill ❤
I’ve watched this several times & your tutorial to join QAYG is my favorite!!! Thank you!!!
Great tutorial. I really enjoyed it. I've seen others, but this is the one that really made it click for me. I think I'll try it.
Awesome! Love it! Thanks! Thank you for the wonderful tutorial...clear and precise instructions given!
I've watched several videos using the same technique, but for some reason, yours is the one that clicked for me.  It just made sense. Thank you for posting it.
Awesome tutorial.
Beautiful quilt.  Love the tutorial.  Thank you so much for sharing
This is a great video.
Brilliant! Thank you so much. This is exactly what I hoped to find when I set out to make a very special blanket!
I have discovered you and love your work.  I was looking for quilt as you go tutorials and found you.  I tried looking up previous videos on how to make these blocks and I can only go back to May 2013 .   Do you have a website where I can find these instructions?  Thank You!
I have only been quilting for a short time and I have had a question that this lady has answered for me. I like the way you explain things. Thank you very much and God bless you.
I'm another newbe who wondered how she was going to assemble a largish quilt.  Thank you very much for clear and concise instructions, I am absolutely delighted that I can now finish my first quilt, thank you once more.
Why do you use a 1” strip on the back and then a 2” strip folded on the front?
A huge THANK YOU Susan Claire, have just finished a quilt using your method of quilt as you go. This is an amazing way to put together a quilt particularly when there is limited work space. Thank you, Sue 💕
Absolutely love this idea to do each square as you go
My quilt center is done - looks great, and next I am preparing for the border.  So far, so good!  Thank you, Susan.
looks great, I just keep thinking when you sew the tiny stripped side why not use a zipper foot !  I know nothing about quilting but it just popped into my tiny mind.  Excuse me I need to take the laptop to the machine (watch) and try all this... step by step, fantastic watching!  Thank you xx
Brilliant!
Bravo!  Just what I wanted to know!
Thank you so much for your video tutorials. I really enjoy your style and you are such a great teacher. You make it so easy to understand. Please keep making these great tutorials. God bless
Liked your "square in square" quilt as you go video. Finished blocks were 10 inches square. Given the proportions of the block, one might want to consider leaving the blocks 10" square before joining. Perhaps more proportional? In this joining video, you mention trimming the blocks are 9.5 inches prior to joining. Given you mention this joining video (#074), do you recommend leaving the blocks 10" square before affixing the sash fabric?
Awesome! Thank you.
Bonjour, est-il possible avec cette technique, d’assembler que des bandes? thanks from Polynesia
A 10-year-old from my Sunday school class asked me to teach her some quilting methods. You inspire me to teach this method that you use. Thank you from Minnesota.
You are an amazing instructor!   Thank you so much for sharing with us.😊
I love this quilt!!  Thank you for the awesome tutorial.
Great teacher, better than most I've watched.
What a great idea! Thank you for your tutorial! Very easy to follow and understand 😊
Hi and thank you very much! 😎🌸
Has anyone done this on a serger? Any reason you couldn't?
Спасибо!👍👍👍👏👏👏
Thank you so much for your tutorials! I love your easy to understand instructions! You are great!
Thank you!
Can I get a pattern with the materials that you used. I love the colors.
Thankyou so much for such a clear straightforward explanation for the Entire process. Because of distracting music or incomplete explanations. Really appreciate you for your teaching and hard work Thankyou again.  Ina
A lovely little quilt, and very nicely explained too! I love all the colours of the quilt, thanks for sharing!
Genius!!!
♥️ Well done!
Great video! I will try this method. Thank you.
Question.  What if I don't want any dashing in between how do I attach?
Beautiful
Beautiful!
I am just getting back into sewing after about 20 years of doing other things. I also want to get back into quilting but don't have the room for traditional quilting. This is the perfect method for me! I love the way you join your blocks so the joints are strong and won't come apart over time with other methods of quilt as you go techniques of joining. Thank you for a great tutorial!
Thank you so much, this is an amazing way of doing things, you explain things wonderfully.
finally. a tutorial i can understand.  thank you so much xxx
fab...was wondering how I was going to join mine...thankyou so much!
Very helpful
I was recently inspired by a reversible stained glass denim quilt that the only notes say was done quilt as you go. Now I can make one thanks to this outstanding video.
Love this idea of QAYG ! Trying it on my next quilt !
Such  a happy quilt.
I am in the process of making a denim quilt out of my husband's jeans. I have never made one. I am making the blocks 6.5 and will be joining four of them them together to make a 12 inch square.  Your method of quilt as you go would probably be ideal so I could quilt each square and have a printed fabric  border between each 12 inch square. How wide do you think I should make each border? What type of material would you recommend for the border?
Thank you so much for sharing this. This is the best tutorial on joining QAYG squares that I've seen.
Fantastic tutorial!  I've been watching plenty of quilt as you go videos, but this one really helped me to visualize bringing it all together. Many thanks, and the quilt looks gorgeous.
This is wonderful!!!
Wow.  Fantastic way to quilt & join the blocks. I have a lot of log cabin blocks finished.  Cant wait to use your method thank you.
You are a excellent teacher Thankyou
Good clean tutorial and easy to understand!  Thank you.
Love your instruction videos
wow very nice!! thank you for sharing!
THANK YOU!
Thanks so much for this quick and easy to follow tutorial. So well explained compared to some others I've seen.
Can you please tell me, if I use running stitch rather than blanket stitch to hold the appliqué shape, would it be more likely to fray?
super thank you
Love how you explained this. I am ready to try. Lifting heavy quilts is too much for me now with arthritis in my neck injury. I need to do things in small sections, I am 74 now. It looks like you have a PFAFF. I have one and love it. Thank you dear.
don't know if this is okay, but when I join my QAUG blocks I use a stick glue to hold my strips down rather them clumsy pins.  No sticky mess.  I just put it right on the edge.
How wide is the piece of fabric that goes between each row?  Is the front the same two inches folded over, and the back is the one inch sewn with right sides together?
I love this! You are brilliant! I love the colors! Thank you so much!
Wonderful tutorial..thanks. Question:  what size needle do you use to accommodate the thickness of all that material?
Thank you for showing how to do this.  I have the book but was not able to picture what to do clearly for some reason.
Bravo!!!!!!
9/1/2018. Susan come back.
Genius. Thank you. I have some "antique" hand-quilted blocks that a friend wants re-purposed. You have solved my problem.
So cute. Thank you for sharing
Thank You very much!
It was a very good tutorial , missed what width her border was ,hubby was chatting .
This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you for this information and great tutorial easy to understand.
Thank you so much
Best Quilt as you go tutorial!  Thanks much!
Beautiful job
Thank you so much for this wonderful explanation and demonstration
I have been sewing for over 55 years but I am now in the process of making my first big embroidery quilt. I could not have assembled the blocks ever without watching this video. And to be honest I had to watch it several times because the process seemed so complicated. Thank you very much for sharing your video and for your  patient instructions. Now it seems like such a logical process. Many, many thanks!
Awesome for my scraps💗
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🌷💜💋
Thank you for sharing this technique with us. I wish you would have showed us the process  of how to measure and attach the fun sashing.  You have indeed told us how to do this but seeing how it's done would be more beneficial. Thanks
I love this video. I come back to it every time I need to put my block together. 💜
I sewed the striped piece to the second block first and joining the two strips was easier
Thank you so much, you've given me a wonderful idea on how to put my T-Shirt quilt together with some sashing in a much easier way. :)
Thank you, I am going to use this method to assemble my blocks. Your delivery of lesson is so clear.
Fascinating. Have got to try this sometime :)
amazing, ive taught myself to sew for over a year now. I started putting my crumbs/scraps together ... eventually ill cut them into blocks... then what? I do not know... never fear in time I hope to make a quilt.. love watching all these quilters creating such beautiful quilts fancy or simple they are all WOW!
Very very beautiful
Elmers glue works great to hold the strips until you sew too
Oh my!! How LOVELY!! Thank you~ 💓
Great and EASY to understand!
I just finished my first quilt as you go quilt.  I am hooked!! Love everything about the process verses the traditional way.  Thanks for the video.
Thanks so much for this clear concise tutorial. I finished my QAYG blocks today. Tomorrow I cut out the joining pieces and start putting it all together. I wouldn’t feel as confident and sure of how to do it without your help 🌺🌺🌺
Chiarissimo anche se non conosco la lingua grazie 😊
This is wonderful and the quilt is so fun!!! Thank you so much for your time and great explanations.
Very nice I need to do this on my quilt so glad to see how it's done
Thank you for such a great video! But I got one question the front strip should be double the widthof the backstrap am I correct?
Can you use this method for smaller blocks. I’d like to make a calendar wallhanging using 6 inch blocks. TIA
How would you join squares together that have a decorative Edge and not a squared Edge like in your video? Would love to see a video how to do that
I love  this  💟
i love this  she shows realy easy way of doing this, awesome Thank you.
Just watched , so organised and clear , ( unlike some tutors who start filming with wrong glasses and needles) you have inspired me to start quilting again , many thanks , christine England , xxxx
beautifly done
lovely!!!!1
Thanks for this tutorial, great explanation and tips.
I LOVE this!!!!!!!!!!  I like this method with the strips much better than using the backing to join.  And I love the fabric choices!!!!!
ES UN BIES PRECIOSO. LABORIOSO PERO MUY BONITO.
How do I see the other video on how you make the quilted blocks.  Thank you.
Great video!! Thank you for sharing! :)
Great video! I've always been overwhelmed by the thought of quilting a big quilt, but now I can quilt as I go!
Thank you! This is a great tutorial. I will be  using it on my aunt's quilt. She cut the pieces before her death.  I have finished it as a quilt as you go.  I have been wondering how I would connect the blocks.  This is one of the best methods I have seen so far.
I keep watching over and over.  Thank you so much
I love this!
A very helpful and clear explanation!
Thank you. Very easy!!!!
Oh how I wish you had a kit selling this adorable quilt.  Love your method of quilting too.  Where did you buy such pretty fabric?
What a darling quilt!! A great video!! Thanks!!
Thank you for this video - I have shown several friends your technique - and they all join their blocks this way.
Wow so easy to follow! Thanks for the tutorial. 😉
Is it obvious that there is no batting in the sashing once it's done?
Pretty Simple
explained very well.  thanks
Felíz con tus tutoriales, he aprendido mas en un dia contigo que con todos esos tutoriales que he mirado.   Lastimosamente no entiendo nada de inglés pero poniendo toda mi atención en tus manos aprendo bastante.   Dios bendiga tus conocimientos.
Loved your video, you made it so easy to follow your directions, looking forward to more video's.
You made that look so easy !! I just Love it !!
My question is ..can you make the stripes wider. Like a 2inch strip on the back and on the front a 4 inch strip folded in half foot the back..
I can not believe I see people who unlike this. I am in love with this quite. You have done  beautiful job with it. Thank you so much for sharing!
I am going to try this one1  Thank you
Really love this quilt as you go,thank you for sharing.
love this video I want to try this as it looks simple and amazing... although no matter how hard I try I can never sew in a straight line lol
omg you made this look so simple and it has finally clicked in my head... Thank you
I love making quilts...I HATE PUTTING THE BACKS ON......THIS IDEA IS GENIUS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You saved me today!!! I was going to use a different method and got to cutting and cut the wrong thing and thought I had messed everything up... thank you so much for this alternative method!!
Very fun looking quilt. Great idea.
Thanks very informative I'm sure I can follow that very easily
You make this look so simple! Thanks
It's lovely!  So cozy looking - I really like the backing, that little stripe adds even MORE to it.

Thank you so much. This is very helpful and fun.
this was amazing. thank you so much. loved the design too.
Thank you so much! I'm currently making my first quilt and this tutorial was perfect, easy to follow, and my quilt is looking fantastic.
Thank you for this great tutorial. Very well done. Starting my first "quilt as you go" and I'm now confident that I'll be able to join my blocks in a professional looking manner.
Thank you so much for this tutorial, it has helped me when I got stuck with all my blocks. Awesome idea, thanks again
Super cute quilt, Miss Claire! And I really enjoy your teaching style. :D
What a great idea!!! Thank you
Thanks so much.   I have the blocks done  but was pondering how to join them !!!   LOVE IT !!!
Xxxxw
Can you tell me the name off quilting pins that look like a long u shape and the bent end is slightly turned up, seen them used to hold two seems above each other, just can't remember there name can anyone help me please,thanking you in advance.
IF I use a 2" srip for the front side - what size should the backside strip measure?
great teacher indeed
I love your tutorials. Do the strips have to be 1 and 2 inches wide?
super cute quilt, ty for the video.
very nice very neat thank you
Love that little quilt.. Going to give this method a try.  Thanks
Thanks you for the video. Enjoyed it and the information was very helpful. Finished a sample quilt thinking of adding borders to.
What a wonderful tutorial. Precise, clear instructions. Everything I needed to know in one easy lesson. Thank you.
Thanks for the clear and concise instructions.  Also, I love the vibrant and playful colors, as well as the originality you show in quilting the individual squares.  Inspirational.
Really great tutorial. Thank you.
Thanks very much - your video is clear and informative - and I've learnt a lot. Can't wait to try it.
You are brilliant! Thank you for you videos!
Great video.  Does this work on full sized quilt.  Seems like it would be stiff??
Thank you for teaching me how to do this!!!
This a great video.  I've used it to make a queen sized quilt and a lap quilt and am currently working on another queen sized one for my son's bed.  Nce I got the technique down it went so fast.  Thank you so much for doing this video.  By the way, I rewatch it before starting another one so I get it right without guessing!
Thank you for an easy-to-understand video!
Thank you very much. This was so helpful. I may begin a baby QAYG project after the holidays.
براااااافوا تسلم ايديكى
Is it possible to make a quilt as you go, reversible biscuit quilt? I was hoping to make one without sashing. Do you have a video that would help?
Sorry, I flagged this in error and didn't undo before going onto another video. I thought flagging here is like pinning in Pinterest.
I love this quilting method.  I made a queen sized one and it turned out great.  Thank you.
thank you for your video, it is very helpful. you made it look so easy, i hope it will be for me aswell.
I love this! Thank you! And I love your color choices for fabric. Thank you. :)
Thank you for this brilliant tutorial.  I found this via Joe Zuchowich's link and have found both tutorials so very helpful.
I really enjoyed your video.
I tried to find your e-mail to no avail. I just have a question before I do my binding.   I made a photo quilt, following your quilt as you go method.  I would like my binding to be the same size as the strips are wide.  All my front strips are cut at 2" and folded in half.  Now that they are sewn they measure 3/4" wide.  What I need to know is:  What size wide do I cut my binding strips to get the front binding to fold over to 3/4"?  And also do I change the sewing from 1/4" to something different???  Please help.  I would send you a photo of the quilt, but not sure how. I sure hope you can help me soon.  I love your videos and have done 3 quilts with your quilt as you go method.  Love it!  Thanks so much!
beautiful
excellent video easy to understand love your work
Great video! You are wonderful! Please make more quilting videos.
Thank you lady. Great tutorial
That is a beautiful quilt! Enjoyed watching you explain how to sew the blocks together. Will make quilting each individual block much easier than wrestling with the whole quilt. Thank you "sew" much. :) Your a great easy to understand instructor/ teacher!!👍😀
What a wonderful way to you up those small amounts of left over batting, thanks for tip!
Do you change your stitch length ?
Thank you so much for this post. This is a genius way to join the blocks together. I used to get on the floor to put the layers of my quilt together but am no longer able to get back up. It has been so long since I have made anything. Now my thoughts are racing at with possibilities. Again, thank you!
Great tutorial
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I carried 15 lap quilted squares around for about 25 years because I never knew how I was going to put them all together.  When I saw your tutorial, the light bulb turned on and I successfully put together enough sampler quilt squares to make a quilt that graces the bottom of my guest bed...and it is something I'm proud of even though I was just learning.  Is it perfect?   Of course not...but it's a finished project and I'm proud to say it's mine and I have come so far since then.  Again, I want to thank you for giving me the courage to put it all together.  My husband always asked me why I continued to tote around a big bag full of quilt blocks...I always knew when the time was right, I'd know what to do.  You provided that time!  :)
I DID IT. IT WORKED.
I adore Susan's tutorials!!
I just discovered this video, and it's makes quilting now look so easy. Thank you for sharing! I was a little intimidated before, but quilting as you go by block and seeing the end result like this has inspired me. Thank you for sharing!
Best explanation yet thanks very much x
THIS IS  AWESOME ..AND WILL USE THIS METHOD ON LOTS OF QUILTS..WHAT A TIME SAVER NOT TO MENTION  RELIEF FROM KNEE AND BACK ACHES..I 'M WORKING ON A BLOCK QUILT NOW AND HOPE TO BE ABLE TO USE 'QAYG' METHOD... I ALREADY HAVE BLOCKS CUT 6.5....   SASHING  (TO ADD BLOCKS)  CUT 1.5 X 6.5....LONG STRIP  FOR JOINING ROWS .1.5 X  MY QUESTION IS BEFORE I START ..DO I NEED TO CHANGE TO WIDTH OF SASHING/LONG STRIP  SINCE I GOT TO FOLD OVER.... WILL WAIT FOR AN ANSWER BEFORE I START TO SEW..GUESS I CAN GO GET BATTING OUT...THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GREAT ALL DONE AT ONE TIME..THANKS AGAIN  BLESS ALL
awesome thanks for sharing your talent  ---i sewed 120 10 inch blocks using 10 inch foundation paper  ---i don't like all that bulky edges ---i surfed forever on the net about ideas on how to put the squares together  ---when i saw this video i broke into a happy dance  ---now to get the materials to finish the quilt
You are a great teacher. Easy to understand and very knolegable. Thaks for sharing.
unradable video, tecnica  perfecta gracias
Thank you so much for these videos.  Complete beginner, making my first quilt using your 'quilt as you go'.
Hi. Would it be possible for you to show us how you did the stars please?
Thank you! Have to try that! God Bless♡
Thank you.  This really helped me.
Great tutorial, thank you.
Can you direct me to your videos showing how to complete the steps for these blocks prior to attaching them together? I am working on blocks now but I want to view how you add the batting and backing and quilt them together.
I can't find the video showing you adding the borders on the quilt as you go.Just cutting the pieces? How do you sew them on? Do you use sashing if so where and how?
i would love to quilt. but I get discouraged.. I CAN NOT use a rotary cutter. What am I doing wrong?? I only try to cut two pieces of fabric together, and it still will not cut through both... so this makes me totally mad and I end up stopping.. just because i cant get the pieces cut even. I can not use scissors, my left hand does not work properly. this is so neat and I love it.
This is an easier method than another I found.  Thanks
Do you use Facebook?? I know how to send there....
Hi GQ, i've finished the project but don't know how to send the pics on here. Actually I had to video it b/c it's SO Big. Now if I can just figure out how to send it here or maybe sending it in email will be better?? If u know how to guide me along on how to do that, I will Appreciate it....tnx
This works! So easy. So glad I found your video. Thank you!!
What a great tutorial!  The best I've seen on joining blocks and borders so far.  Thank you for sharing :)
✿♡ VERY WELL DONE! ♡✿
Thank you so much for your excellent video.  I was quite flummoxed as to how to complete a quilt using the quilt as you go method until I watched your very clear, very informative video.  Thank you for taking the time to make the video and for sharing your knowledge.
can you use a serger to make these quilts? Instead of a regular machine?
Do you have an episode of how you did the binding?  Patrick.
That is sooooooooooooooo Beautiful!!!!!! Patrick!
Thank you for uploading this video...I always wondered how this was done!
Brilliant! This is the cure for me since the throat of my machine is too small for a half a quilt to fit in! I love your videos!
Sandwiching a quilf
That was very good, clear and I formative. I am an experienced quilter but not experienced with quilt as you go! I found this perfect and so good it was Australian too!! I feel confident to carry on. Keep up the u tubes.
Love your lessons!  Easy to follow with beautiful results.
great learning tip!
BEST video ever!
Adore I
Hi,  I am looking to see him you bind the quilt after the borders are on.  Do you have a tutorial to bind the quilt after borders are done. Many many thanks for your videos. Tina
Thank you for this tutorial.  I am making two for my grandchildren. Can you tell me how to Finnish off all around the edges after putting the border on please
beautiful! Thank you!
Zohar is your email address . Would love to send you picture of my quilt
This is a great tutorial. Used the same print fabric for joining strips and backing. The print blended in with my squares and gave my large quilt a dressier look!
That is awesome.  Could you quilt say, feathers, before joining the squares?
This is so helpful!  I'm finishing some QAYG blocks and plan to join them soon, and this is the only method I've found that gives me the effect I want.  Thank you!!
I just found you on YouTube. Love the technique and colors!!
nice instructions
Thank you for making this video. You make it look so easy. I'm going to be helping my youngest granddaughter(she's 11) make her first quilt soon. I had helped her older sister do one several years ago(she was 9) & we tried a different way of the QAYG, I found it more difficult to do than the way you just showed us, so we'll be using your method. Hugs & Happy Sewing, Linda
Thank you so very much for this great tutorial.  I am a beginner and I am looking forward to using these tips and techniques.  Can't wait to start and quilt my way through another winter in Canada.
Excellent video, thanks. I was about to make a big mistake!!!!
Thank you for this video. This idea is great .  Best regards from Germany Marita
Great idea. Thanks
Your tutorial rocks!  I've been hunting for an easy to follow, and straight to the point video that would show me how to connect QAYG blocks, and a lot of the video tutorials out there were so sluggish and dragged on and on...I nearly fell asleep on them.  But your video tutorial is exactly what I was looking for.  So easy to follow, and painless to watch.  Thank you for your help!
It IS so adorable! love your quilt
thank you so much! i was wondering if this was possible
Hello Gourmet Guilter, I need some instruction on how to sew my rows/columns Please. I have 8 blocks in each row and 9 columns of rows down. Which would you sew first, Rows or Columns?? My brain can't figure out what would be the easiest way when running them thru my machine ;>) (i'm stunned when trying to figure out how things fit)! Pitiful, huh.....lol
Awesome, that is a beautiful quilt.
Thank you, looks so easy can't wait to have a go
Thank you for make it so simple and really beautiful x
I knew there had to be a simpler way than what I was contemplating. You put the thoughts together for me. Such a great video and instructions. God Bless & Happy New Year!
your technique makes quilting so easy, I will try this , thank you so much :)
Great video - thank you!  I have been wondering how to 'quilt as you go' for quite some time and you explain it very clearly.  I am thinking of using this technique for my English paper pieced Grandmothers Flower Garden quilt.  The hand work was very enjoyable but I like how quickly the blocks go together already quilted with this method!
Thank you for the video. You explained it so well. I am going to give it a try.
Thank you so much for making the videos, I  have found your videos to be a blessing. Thank you so much!
I just love this.  Have one question, hope it is not dumb.  Once you finish joining the blocks do you do binding on the raw edges that are left or is there a way to do the striping all the way around.  Hope I did not miss something in your videos.
Great video. Thanks
I have watched several quilt as you go videos and yours was by far the easiest one for me to understand. thank you so much!
I just LOVE this idea! You don't know what a God-send this is for me! I've been trying to figure out how to make a 'table quilt' for a man who restores guitars & right now he's using old raggedy towels to protect the bottom side of the guitars...you have just shown me how to give him a 'quilt' made of guitar & musical notes prints for his table!!! thankyouthankyouthankyou!!! ♥  Could I ask what brand of sewing machine you're using? I am still struggling with my second hand 19 yr old machine & need a new one. Thanks in advance... ~Ginger
This is a wonderful video - beautiful piece and you have such a sweet smile. Thank you for showing us your joining method. I have only just discovered "quilt as you go" and I think it is AWESOME! Can't wait to get started! :)
Love this! I have quilted blocks with 2" borders all around each block. I have yet to put it together, as I don't want more than 1/4" or 1/2" (finished) showing on either side of quilt. Not to mention, that it's already king size, and don't want it much bigger! Is what I'm wanting, able to be accomplished? At this point, to get as little as possible showing, I'd be willing to hand stitch to get it finished! Thank you!
I really like you're tutorials.  You explain things simply and sew and you go so that we can follow along easily.   Good job!
I have been following your site for quite a while, your instructions are so clear and easy to follow.  Thank you so much for your help, I'm almost completely finished my quilt and am now following how to place the boarders around the quilt as you go.  Fantastic site.
wonderful! neat and so fun!
what a beautiful  colorful  quilt.great job. thanks for sharing
WOW How modern and easy you make it look. I will definitely be having a go at this thankyou for sharing your hard work xxx
I put my pins in the other way...so that the point of the pin just skims the seam area.  Most machine will sew right over the point, but you can still easily pull the pin out before you come to it on the machine.
Que lindo! Amei!
Nice quilt and easy. Thanks for sharing on how to complete Quilt as you go. Very well done on the video.
thank you again for your videos... just love them and this is my second time to comment but it's because i was watching it again... :) .... i love how colorful this material is... would you happen to know the name of this material so i can search for it.. always looking for bright colors and this is perfect... thank you!
You and every other video assume that every person watching knows how to start a quilt. What materials you should use and how to prepare them to get started.
Hi, could you use 1 inch bias binding to join the bocks instead of cutting all the strips?
Saturday class with you today.  Thank you Teacher!
I like this for me its great
Love yhis video joining blocks together
Thank you so much for teaching me this, i have made quite a few quilts now and have tailored my own little technique but always use the sashing skills i learned off you  ❤ ❤ ❤
I admire you! All you do is so perfect. I love you and wish you stay a long time with us on youtube!
my middle bit is 1 in think what size would you say i would need to copy you many thanks clair
I watched your video twice, sat down and put it together without ever needing to look back...this is the simplest way to handle large-small quilts! Thank you so much for the video.
Estupenda ayuda para quienes no tenemos maquinas grandes para manejar el acolchado
i love this idea, never knew how to do it,  Just found your channel and love it!!!
Very well done!  Thank you and I love the baby quilt and your choice of colors..
Thank you so much for sharing this video. I am a new quilter, and I have made my first crazy quilt blocks, have them all quilted, and am ready to go with the joining. In fact, I have joined the first two. This is awesome.
Thank you for the great video!!
What happens if you want wider sashing? I'd like my finished sashing to be 2 1/2"? Thank you!
Love all your videos! Thanks for sharing!
what batting do you use inside of this? I assume light weight
Thank you for these tips.
My mind is blown! This is amazing. I've been wanting to attempt a quilt as you go and this makes it seem so simple.
Thank you so much. I'm almost finished The 15 huge blocks that I have been hand quilting for months. (I do this when I'm sitting or traveling). I was wondering how I was going to join them. This is a great idea. Thanks again!!!
I love this idea!  GREAT way to join the blocks as you go, and beautiful too!
The joining of the QAYG blocks is brilliant! It is by far the best QAYG tutorial I have seen. Most other QAYG only quilt the top with the batting/wadding. This is definitely the way to go if you are making a Queen size or larger quilt.
Great video! Your quilt is so beautiful and bright. Thanks for sharing your technique.
If you wanted to make the joins wider for example 5" strip and a 2.5" strip, would you have to add some batting inside the folded 5" square?
Thanks for the video very informative and so clear instructions, I am in the midst of using this technique on my wall hanging quilt.
I really enjoyed this video, It takes away the fear I had about appliqué and block piecing. I'm going to give it a tray.
Wonderful video! Thank you so very much for sharing this idea and your beautiful baby quilt.
Fabulous series that you put together on this quilt. Absolutely gorgeous quilt! Just brilliant!
I am so glad I found you here on youtube I have learned so much from you Thanks
After watching your video, I think that I am getting confident to make a quilt as you go .  Wonderful tutorial . Thanks a lot for teaching
Thanks so much.  I could not imagine how to do this, and you have explained it with demonstrations that make perfect sense!
The film was lovely. I couldn't hear the commentary so put on the subtitles. They are hilarious. When you have a minute have a look. Thanks for your demo's. Easy to understand, despite the subtitles.  Judy Etheridge, England.
beautiful reversible quilt!  Thanks for sharing your technique.  GOOD JOB!
Thank you so very much. I had started a quilt for my granddaughter before she was born. It was a very small baby quilt and due to unexpected events in life I didn't finish it. She found the quilt and wants me to finish it for her and it needed to be bigger but I didn't know what to do. So thank you. Ella is 6 now so maybe I can finish it for her..
Once again another easy to follow video and I so love the colours you always choose for your wonderful quilts. You are one I like to follow and learn so much from so thank you from the bottom of my heart for your tutorials....
I have looked and looked and watched and watched but have done nothing but get more and more confused, UNTIL I found this video!!  I knew there had to be an easier way than the overly complicated tutorials I was finding. This is THE way to join your blocks. You are the best Susan!!  Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us, it is very much appreciated.  Your tutorials are so very well done and you explain things in a way that is simple to understand and straight forward.
very clever,that's awesome, I love it
Your tutorials are the best I've seen on how to join quilt as you go squares.  I have become a great fan of yours.  Hi from SW Florida!
Wonderful!! Had this verbally explained to me once and was so lost i have never tried it. But you demonstrated it so beautifully i can't wait to give it a try. And this quilt is so beautiful, love the colors.
This is easiest way to connect Quilt as you Blocks that I have ever seen . Will have to give it a go.
You are wonderful! So easy to watch and understand you! Thank you!  :)
I totally love watching these videos!  Where are you GourmetQuilter?  Thought you were overseas from me in America ~ I love to hear your accent.  But to ALSO have the explanations in inches!  Wow!  Feeling so lucky to have found you. (My favorite so far is the zippy pouch.) :-)
Thank You for this Video!  you are excellent at explaining how to Appreciate it!
Thank you for opening up my world! I am so very grateful for your contributions to my future joy and creativity!
The tips were very easy to follow.Thank you.
Wonderful tutorial, thank you for explaining it so clearly:)
+GourmetQuilter  Someone else is hosting this video which is surely not what they are meant to do. Their name on YouTube is Music. Love all your videos.
LOVE this video and that quilt is the cutest i've ever seen! very informative and well done... i really enjoy your videos! thank you so much!
I'd like to thank you for your generosity in sharing your knowledge freely. I am new to You Tube and have found your videos so much help.
Thank you so much, I used this method to do my first King size quilt for a christmas present to my sister. It turned out beautiful and it was so easy and a fast method to use.
Hi Susan, I watches this video only last month and used this method of joining blocks for my very first quilt made from used ties. Turned out great..my customer was very pleased..wanted 3 more and brought more ties to use. Thank you so very much.  Happy New Year and I'm looking forward to what you share next year.  Ella in NC
watching you put this together and others that i have watched is like having my expert mother in law with me . your fantastic and I will be learning on my own time now instead of only sometimes with my mother in law, it will be much time with you. awesome.
Makes machine quilting easy.
this is awsome,  i am going to try quilting tips and techniques my self,  makes it easier to do free motion.
I always wondered how to finish a quilt as you go quilt! Thank you...wonderful video with clear instructions! I can't wait to try it!
what kind of batting do you use?
I really enjoy your videos, thank you
gracias.
Excellent. Thanks for teaching
Susan thank you for this tutorial, I can't wait to try it.  How does it work on a big bed quilt? Janet
Thank you! Great information. It would make a really nice reversible quilt.
i love this video i am making all my quilts like this now thank you so much
i love this video thank you mam.
What a brilliant, simple, clear tutorial.  You make this look totally do-able. Thank you.
best demonstration of quilting as you go I have seen!  Thanks for this video!
Adorei a técnica, parabéns e obrigada por compartilhar seus conhecimentos. Boa sorte!
Thank you for sharing this technique!  I'm going to try it!
That is absolutely brilliant! Thank you for the tutorial!
Thank you for an awsome video :-) Now I understand how to do it :-)
That's a beautiful quilt! Thank you for sharing.
Very nice. Would you then add a binding, or did you sew the borders together in such a way that they don't need be bound?
This is the BEST!! tutorial I have seen. I'm fixing to give it a go.  Thanks so much for sharing.
Thank you for this info.  You do a good job of explaining the process.  And that quilt is cute.  :0)
The video of quilt as you go strips, QT&T 071, is here http://youtu.be/QELyDSBTN6o
Where can i find your video of quilt as you go strips?
Dit is zeer handig
Well-explained!  Great job of graphically describing how to put the "quilt as you go" squares together! Thanks!
I discover you now and I just love what you do!!!....my dream is to have stronger sewing machine. Anw, love your explanation! Thanks from Czech rep. :)
Just finished a 4x4 meter quilt on domestic machine!!! WISH I had seen this first...never going struggle like that again....
Yay I did it! Have just joined my first four blocks together using your technique. You are such a good teacher! Your explanations are so clear and delivered in a lovely manner. Thanks so much for sharing your skills. Greetings from London
Just purely lovely! Thank you!
Nicely done.  Thanks!
Before watching your video I cut my front strips 2.5" and wondering if I can just cut the back strips 1.5" and get the same results?
Thanks so much . I will be able to finish some quilts now.
Thank you so much for this video. I'm learning how to quilt right now and have been nervous about quilting on a small machine. I'd seen the term "Quilt as you go" but didn't know how it was done. Your video was a perfect explanation!
Luv your Video on Quilt as you go! Thank You very self explained.....
Thank you so much. Very clear explanations and this is what I've been looking for. Love your quilt on this tutorial. Look forward to watching more of your tutorials.
This technic was explained perfectly.  Thank you so much!
Hangulatos, szép munka.
I didn't know about this method...thank you for explaining it so thoroughly and simple to learn....I'm thinking of giving it a go since my swap pile is starting to take over a bit....thanks again...I subscribed to your channel. .. :)
hi ya    just rewatched your work...........penny has dropped...........I have been quilting on and off for over 30 yrs and have not tried this amazing method........just bought more fabric (as you do) to make my grandaughter another quilt and am going to do my first quilt this way..........thanks sooooooooo much......barb UK
Thank You!! I love you and your quilting tips!!
I LOVE THIS, GREAT JOB AND GREAT EXPLAINING.
But then there is a lip in the sashing, not sure I'd like that.
Awesome...have been looking for an easy way to join my quilt in the hoop blocks!!
Thank you so much for all your demonstrations... This one is what I have been looking for and now can do a fantastic quilt as you do... X
Thanks so much for showing me how to do this. I will be doing this from now on. :)
I can't wait to try this out.  I will be making a queen size quilt this way.  Can I use different size strips for borders than the 1" & 2" that you used?  For example, if I want 2" of border between my blocks, would I cut strips 2 1/2" for the back, and 5" for the front?  Thank you!
Always a pleasure watching you and listening to your tutorials. Thanks so much
Really nice! Thank you for your generosity!
Thank you! Wonderful! :)
Thank you very much!  Very good directions, I'm looking forward to make one similar to yours. Blessings :)
Soooo nice thank you!!!
Thank you so much for this tutorial. It was very easy to understand. My question it this : Is there a joining method for quilt as you go blocks that does not end up looking as if you sashed the whole quilt?
Great video, thank you. I finally have grasped how to do it  at last :D
Superb thank you!
Thank you for the great idea's for this darling quilt! I think I can do this, quilt as you go! :) It makes it a lot easier than trying to quilt a big quilt all at once!
Thank you so much it's a lovely little quilt
Thank You for this wonderful tutorial I just found it yesterday and watched again today I will definitely be trying this technique so excited! So many things you can do! Again thank you for being so thoughtful to share your talent!
im going to try this
Wonderful tutorial and so easy to understand. I envy you your barge living, how are you managing to quilt while you are aboard? I fancy a barge holiday this summer and may take some sewing with me. I shall enjoy watching all your videos.
Thank you so much for this demo... Very good information
love this ty
How do you finish the outside edge of the quilt then, with bias strip material that coordinates with the fabrics?
Thankyou for this excellent video. I had made the squares and had no idea how I was going to join them.  And so nice to hear an English voice rather than American for a change!
Thank you for this!
Lovely quilt and great tutorial. Very well explained. Very helpful. Thank you so much!
Maám thanks a lot for this tutorial. Am new to quilting but I want to make one for our queen size bed, upon request of my husband. If it were not for this tutorial, I would never have put it together. It was easy too if you take it slow, as you said. So thanks once again. Keep posting vids!
I would like to repeat the question asked by R Martin below............because you have stitched the back strips down, do you just snip the wadding or how do you do it across the seams of the small down pieces..................thanks, nice tutorial
What a lovely idea, and so bright and cheerful!!!!! Love your tutorials, thank so very much.
Much appreciate your tips - fantastic looking quilt too!
Thank you so much for sharing this technique. You have demystified it for me and I now feel that i can try it without any worries!
I really like this! It's perfect for me because I've limited space.
Beautifully done! Thank you!!
I favor Susan's instruction in the Gourmet Quilter.  She's very concise in her explanations and work - easy to follow her  instructions.  Thank you, Susan!  Nancy in California.
As a novice quilter, I absolutely LOVE this technique!  I have now completed 6 quilts using this. One was even a Queen-size. But I do have a challenge with the width of the front sashing (2"). I have found that cutting them at 1.5" then folding & stitching, the stitches do not show as much on the back side of the quilt. Am I doing something wrong?
Very good! Learned alot! Thanks.
I just love this technique and you have simplified it so that any one would be comfortable. :}
So cute love this l thnk l will try one  great job
Very nice thank you for posting
I am so excited by your video! I inherited about 20 gorgeous hand embroidered and quilted blocks a while back and had no idea what to do with them. The lady who made them is gone now but would be so happy to know that all of her hard work is indeed, going to result in a beautiful quilt, thanks to your video. Thank you so much.
Could you please show how you put on the long horizontal sashing using this technique and how to line up the vertical sashing on either side of the horizontal sashing, so that everything lines up correctly? Thank you
OMG I absolutely love this technique and your fabric choices. I have been addicted to your channel ever since I discovered you. Your accent is very soothing as you sound just like me mum who passed away this summer. Thank you for all you do and for making these wonderful quilting videos.
I'm doing this with your help, thank you. Great tutorials
Thank you for this video,you have helped tremendously .God Bless.
Am wondering why you use a 2" double piece on the front and a 1" single layer piece on the back ?
Wow.  I had this in segments mentally but could not think of how the whole thing came together.  Thank you so much and yes the web is a grand informational place to have at our fingertips.
Perfect, everything fell right in place.  I love It!!
Best quilt as you go tutorial I have seen thank you
JUST WHAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR! GOD BLESS YOU! YOU ARE GREAT!
me gusta porque ya queda acolhado ymuy aseado
I have so many tips and tutorials on QAYG but at last you have made it look so easy to do and your video is excellent, thanks so much for your time and trouble to share this!  Annie in Saudi Arabia - HAPPY NEW YEAR!
you can also hand stitch the last seam so you don't see the stitches
Love your style with color.  You seem to enjoy this!!
I never knew that this technique ever exsisted! Wow! I'm so going to try this!
I am going to try this with my next quilt! I have a stack of strip blocks I want to join, and the prospect of making the top and then having to quilt it to the bottom was not a fun idea. Thanks for the tutorial
Excellent tutorial!!
I enjoyed your tutorial.  It helped me to know how to do that application but I was wondering on a larger quilt would you piece together longer strips to do the sashing between rows?
Great instructions! Concise, no-nonsense, clear… Thanks!
Such a lovely video, so informative! It's a darling quilt!
Do you do a video on the squares? I would love to make this quilt.
This is still one of the best quilt as you go examples, tutorial, and techniques I've seen. Thanks so much for sharing it with us:-)
Gah! This is simply brilliant! Thank you so much for clearing up this process for me! I've never been able to work out how to nicely join qayg blocks.
Very clear instructions!  Thanks very much. I have only watched a few of your videos so you may have already made this point...but this approach, quilt-as-you-go, would be a super way to practice free motion quilting.  One could use different patterns on different blocks and gain confidence.  Also, could we use wider joining strips to achieve the effect of larger sashing?
Thanks so much for the tut.  I have bookmarked to watch again.  I have wondered how to complete this task.  I appreciate the simple approach.
You have no idea how much I love this video. All I can say is thank you!! I've thought about making the whole finished square but had no idea how to join them, You make all your videos look so very easy. Please make more. :)
Excellent and simple tutorial.  Will definitely try this.  Thanks for posting
Thank you!! I loved the demonstration and the very cute quilt you made! Someday when I have room to do more quilting, I am going to try this!
Thank you. I love your demonstration. Very easy to follow and a lovely quilt.
Thanks, I love the way you used joining strips front and back
How do you make that lovely wiggly border??? Was it the pattern of the fabric? or did you sew wiggly?and how??
Where can I find the preceding videos??? I want to make this quilt alongside you, please!
Appreciate the video very much! Thank you!  Can't wait to quilt as I go so I can quilt managable sized blocks on the machine!
Thanks so much for the tutorial I am ready to give it a go. Many thanks.
Thank you for a great tutorial, I may actually finish some quilts now!
Thank you I'm going to give it a try
Thanks so much for this tutorial. I've watched it two or three times.  I think it's great!  I'm ready to put it into practice.
I love listening to you Brits.   you rarely say UH  which is so annoying and your vocabulary is so different from ours in the US. You are very easy to understand and with me a beginner quilter I appreciate all the different variations of quilting from around the world.  thanks!
Thank you sew much for this video, I'ma beginner & have a lot of blocks sewn & wasn't sure about doing the whole thing at once on the "quilting" after sandwiching, this will make it so much easier. You will have helped a newbie (me) finally complete her very 1st quilt!
Thank you for making this process so clear and easy to understand.  Will be giving it a try real soon.  Thanks again
Oh my this tutorial is a dream come true....thank you ever so much.....Now I know exactly what I need to do for those huge king sized (or smaller) quilts I want to do fancy stitching on......look forward to watching more of you vidoes
You have given the best demonstration of joining quilt as you go blocks I have ever seen!  I have seen plenty of videos demonstrating this, and have just never got it until now. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I usually hand sew and quilt which takes a very long time and I do enjoy it, but I thought it could be fun to get a quilt done quickly using this method. I've been trying to learn from videos and I've finally found the right one, THANKS AGAIN!!!
Thank you so much, I have had a lot of issues with the joints in my hands so, I haven't been quilting much at all, but, thanks to your Video I think I may be able to do get back to quilting by breaking it down to a manageable size. Thank you so much!
Thanks for a great explanation.  I always wondered how quilt as you go blocks were joined up!
I do thank you so much for sharing your expertise on your videos. I want to make one of these... and I WOULD have never thought of this. You make quilting life better!!
I quit quilting a few years ago because it was to hard to finish my quilts thanks for giving me an alternative. Now I just need to get back to it!!! TFS
Prelep pacvork i sada pokusavam da naucim od vas. Hvala vam puno na ovom bloku. Patchwork team.
Thank you for sharing. I enjoy your videos immensely as your instructions are super clear. And your voice is kind, calming and soothing :)
Very Good. What part of England are you from, I am from Oxford.
Lovely! Thank you for sharing your time and talent!!!
Very, very nice - great tutorial.
Yes could you please spend more time on the borders....I  love the technique....Ido not necessarily want to add a different fabric but need more visual aids....could you just make a video for Borders on the technique "Quilt as you go".....
This is a really wonderful technique. Tx a lot for sharing!
Thank you so much for all your videos.  I just enjoy them alot.  When will you be doing another one?
Am big fan in general & love this video in particular, going to try this technique this weekend, wish me luck :)
my problem is doing the borders I have a center square + sahing then squares to be added How do you do that please/
Very nice! You've given me a great idea to finish a Fall quilt I started last year! Thanks a lot. You gave a very clear easy to follow demo.
awesome,i would like to try this,it is so neat
nice explanation, thanks
I love your tutorials................Thank you v much for the fantastic and simple way of teaching.Love u very much
What a fantastic tutorial and a very clever idea.   Thank you for taking the time and effort to make such clear instructions and sharing your skills.
Most excellent video - thank you kindly.
you are awesome! your instructions are so clear, and you are such a pleasant teacher! :-) thank you ever so so much! I cannot wait to get back into sewing again.
Wish I had seen this video before I started to put my quilt as you go quilt together and have struggled to make it look half way decent.  Now I know what to do I will make another.  By the way I love you quilt it is so colouful and cheery.
Thanks, I would love to see what you do with it!
Thanks for watching, enjoy!
You're welcome, thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
Well I am so pleased it has been helpful, hope the quilt worked out OK.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks so much, hope to see what you are making sometime.
You're welcome, look forward to seeing some of your projects!
Well thank you! Hopefully you will find that it isn't so hard after all!
You're welcome, thanks for watching. Would love to see what you are making sometime.
Just love your quilt and technique. Fantastic video. You are an artist and a great teacher. Thanks for the brilliant learning tool. Hugs Liz
Thank you very much for the video,wow i have doing mine alot harder thanks so much for explaining.
I am definitely going to try this.
Omg I love you. Your style of Quilt as you go makes my life sew much more relax. I'll be making and COMPLETING my quilts from now on. :•) thank you for sharing your awesome.
Thank you so much for this tutorial!!! I can see how you can do this QAYG technique on so many fun projects!!
You just blew my mind.  This is awesome, and honestly, you make something hard look so easy, you're very talented.
Love your Video...I am fairly new to QAYG and your video makes it so easy to understand.  I will do my next quilt this way.  Thank you so much for posting this tutorial.
You're welcome, thanks for watching.
This is the best tutorial for QAYG that I have seen to date! Thank you so very much!
You're welcome, thanks for watching.
Wow, thank you! Look forward to seeing something you have made?
Thank you, so pleased you have got it now! Well done! I quilt right to the edge, because the edges are all covered it works well. I think the idea of leaving an inch or so unquilted is so that the layers can be joined separately etc, but this way it helps to have it quilted to the edges.
Thanks for watching.
Oh good, have a great time together.
Thanks for watching.
Thanks so much, and to your friend for sharing!
Hi, I use a 60mm rotary cutter which I find excellent, I do a lot of cutting. Also a 45mm is great. I have found that the larger blade works better for me,
Thank so much for watching.
Oh well done! Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching, enjoy!
I love your tutorials, Susan. I'm a huge fan. I learn so much. Thank you very much.
I'm sooo excited!! I have taken classes, watched a  million video's, and never really fully undstood QAYGO!  You have a wonderful way of teaching and after watching this video 3 times...I GOT IT!!!  I've already made my first sample join just to see how it works (and it did) When you are making  your blocks, do you quilt to the edge or leave an inch or so unquilted?  The old fashion method required you to leave an inch unquilted for attaching the 2 tops pieces together.  Thanks so very much :-)
Cute and easy...
My niece and I are going to make this one together and see how it works for us!  Thanks for the tips!
Beautiful !
I found you through a friend. I love this tutorial.
What size rotary cutter would you suggest? TY for your tutorials, they are very easy to follow and understand! Patty from NY..USA
Thank you so much for an easy but beautiful quilt.  All your tutorials are very clear and easy to understand.  Look forward to your upcoming tutorials!
Thank you so much, my girls at my last quilt retreat tried to show me this method, but I still was having trouble "getting it". I think I've got it now. Thanx again.
Oh, I have to try this!! :)
Thanks so much for watching, enjoy!
Thanks, from where I sit, a stash is a good thing! It doesn't go off, contains no sugar, fat or cholesterol and is full of fibre, it is positively good for you to have a stash!
Thanks for watching, yes, it works with any size block.
Thanks for watching, glad is was helpful.
This was so easy,  and can you do it with the 12.5 blocks the same, Yes?
Thanks so much, I always thought there had to be an easier way to join the blocks..Lots of help...
Thanks so much!
THIS LADY IS REALLY REALLY GOOD
Thanks so much for watching and I'm pleased it has been helpful. Look forward to seeing what you make.
Wow, thanks so much. I really enjoy playing fabric and love to share!
I think this is a very clever technique for joining QAYG blocks, I've always wondered how to get it to lay flat. I adore the brightly coloured fabrics you use in all of your tutorials Susan, they just add to the inspiration of it all. Thank you for all of your extra explanations, such as reversing the method of attaching the 'sashing' strips on top and bottom if you wish to finish the folded 'sash' by hand, to do it on the back of the quilt. Those extra tidbits show what an expert you truly are!
Glad to be able to help! Thanks for watching.
I love your tutorials! I've been blindly piecing things together because instructions for quilting are always SO complicated - but you have helped immensely!
Thanks for watching
Yes, large quilts can be quite awkward to manage.
Great, it is so good to get things finished!
Great, it is so good to get things finished!
Thanks for watching
I have made several quilts this way, love it, I just need a larger table set up for king size quilts to make it easy to move the quilt through, as you get to the last few strips
Excellent video! Thank you! I'm in the process of a quilt as you go quilt with blocks that have been sewn into strips.  I will  join the strips using the method you've shown after each is quilted.. This is so much easier than trying to quilt a whole quilt!
thank you again i will now finish my quilt as you go.i have done quilt as you go before but i like this way better.
Great instruction! Thank you so much for sharing. I wondered how this was done and it looks do-able. Have a great day!
You're welcome.
Oh good, it isn't too hard and looks great.
Thank you...you are a wonderful teacher! I am a very visual learner and your videos are helping me tremendously!
