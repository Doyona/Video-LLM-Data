This time it's an easy recipe but it's so fun to make that I thought everyone should know how to do it! I actually forgot about pop rice (or puffed rice) until recently when we had dinner at a hotel where they actually served it to us. I personally think pop rice on the stalk is the most fun of all, but of course if you don't have access to a rice paddy then you can make this with any raw rice at all from your grocery store.
What happened to jun?
You obviously do not care about your cats. If you did, you wouldn't have them around hot stuff and having all the stupid popcorn flying around it could burn your cat eyes who cares about your recipe you need to watch your pets and take care of them.
2:02 😮 achtung! It is dangerous, why cats were so close? 🤦
Does that get rid of the lectins too #JunsKitchen? TYVM just found u lol
Wow! Thank you soooooooooooooo much!
Oh Poki loved that
Sick 🤢, maybe next time you can get the cat's to tea bag your food before you eat it.
came for the rice, stayed for the cats

Can you use jasmin rice?
tried it twice and i burnt them..
What if you wanna do it more healthy? How can you make it without using oil?
Ben yaptım ama benim pirincler neden patlamıyor😢
❤ thanks for your recipe idea !
He made everything in the toughest way possible. Too much oil with the rice. A small amount of oil (similar to popping popcorn) and he could’ve popped everything without having to scoop it out like that.  Also he could’ve just mixed the rice into the melted chocolate and then scooped that into the mold.
猫にチョコレート嗅がせるとかマジでありえない
Gluten rice or Rice ?special rice ?
So basically we need fresh rice for this recipe?
I love that y’all originally got Haku as Rachel’s cat but you always bring him along to get ingredients in these videos
That's very artful. Thank you.
Realmente se ven deliciosas, me encanta toda tu presentación, es fabuloso este vídeo sencillamente perfecto!!
Can you use different oils like sesame oil avocado oil etc?
Haku is so obedient and chill. I can’t believe he patiently waited for Jun at the paddy field in the bike pannier. My cats would’ve escaped and disappeared for good.
The glossed-over chaos of the puffed rice flying everywhere has the same feel of Poki screaming in the middle of something like a SakuraCo sponsorship
foda
why let the cats sniff something they cant possibly eat? thats torture
I may have to try this it looks good ngl
I've seen this puffed rice made using oil as you did here and also popped using black salt as the Indians of India do. Always fun to watch no matter which means is used. Beautiful kitties. That was a really cool machine that threshed your rice and then poliished it for you. Got nothing like that here in the US😢.
It did not work for me.  The rice just got crispy.  It did not pop.
i made this and the rice puffed but it burnt

I'm interested with that rice, did you export here in the Philippines?
DON’T USE CANOLA OIL. It is one of the worst things that you could ever consume.
Please don't feed your cat chocolate. It's poisonous. Not for human, but to a cat, it is.
Hola, cualquier grano de arroz es...o es un grano especial?

Can we use any kind of rice to make pop rice? Should it be washed before fried? Please let me know... Thanks
Can you do this with any rice or is some better than others? What did you use?
But it's still wheat we dont have that local grocery store

your uncle needs to make a youtube channel, i would want to see his daily routine at the farm
my family used to eat those in the 80's instead of normal popcorn lol (btw if youre wondering im not asian)
Hi Jun. I have differents recipes on my channel. What's your opinion about my okonomiyaki? Is correctly done? Thanks and I'm enjoy in this channel
After all is said and done, this dude fwops a can of fancy feast over in a dog bowl, and footslides it over to his cats all while wearing a tank top and 3 day worn boxers...then he sits down on his sullen gray couch, shoves his hand down his aforementioned boxers, commences to scratch his junkyard, and plays solitaire on his burner phone.....
i have severe depression and for some reason, your videos are one of the few things on this planet that actually helps me temporarily. Because of that, thank you so much for what you do and i look forward very much to each and every new video you post ☺️
This is our staple snacks in Bangladesh 😃 We eat puffed rice with every possible thing such as curry, lentil soup, sugar and milk, molasses, onion mustard oil and chilli, chick pea and also when nothing else we can find we eat the mere puffed rice 😂
Note to self don’t use jasmin rice
3:50 He even made opening a chocolate bar look cool 😆.
what does that machine do? i’m assuming remove the outer layer?
beauties！！
Now that what I call 'fried rice'
Cat content and food = perfect video
**pop ups a chocolate** me: :0 **broken the chocolate** me: :( **melt the chocolate to make new ones** me: :000

In my place, we usually use leftover rice, dry them then fry them
I wanted to taste that kind of rice, all we have here are long grained
mmm yum
2:37 awwwwesome
Very beautiful idea!))
Does it have to be a specific type of rice, or just any?
When you say something unrelated to the video and get likes: confused stonks
In America, we call it Rice Krispies
Jun’s kitchen is the exact opposite of Julien’s aries kitchen 😂
This is khoi in Bengal u get it is exactly what popped rice is
1:20 Can you explain what this machine did with rice and what you can do else?
I thought you would let your cats eat that chocolate
Does no one wanna talk about how obedient his cats are
I love the way he opens the chocolate bar!
Dude put some in a bowl with some cows milk and sugar, I promise you won't regret it
I belive the correct name is ricecrispys
Popcorn rice sounds gooood omg omg gon and with chocolate omogomgomg
Is popcorn rice like a rice crispy without all the sugar and stuff... just the rice puffs
I like how both Haku and Poki lick their lips when smelling the rice
Man the oil is gonna be popping but it'll be worth it..
I would have gone with a big flat bar with a baking tray but yours looks waay better.
Wow uwu
oh it looks so aesthetic at the end!
what is that stove called?
But what kind of rice should you use to make this?
Poki is having the time of his life right now
I like how the cats are sooooo calm but if my dog heard that popcorn 'popin, she be like "HELL NAH MYSHA,OUT" *Run away*
Everything this guy does, is a statement.
I love how his videos are cinematic!!!
Beautiful Kramer
I tried this but with only one peace of rice
Is there a certain type of rice I'm supposed to be using for this
Omg I love puffed rice
This used to be done in india too  It used to be an olden way to bring rice from rice mills  Now it’s all coming back huh 🥺

Cute cats

How would people hate this.
Jun works his ass everyday to get free stuff stonks
Cute cat
You got a lovley village over there it looking kinda beautiful in fact
Ok but the way he cut open the wrapper on the chocolate bar
DOES JAPAN HAVE MACHINES FOR EVERYTHING? so this filters rice, I’m guessing, and the other give you dry ice? What else, a vending machine for homemade curry?
It works for all type of rice or there are specific one?
I can’t believe you! You food tearorist
Wow so you guys use uncooked rice neat
Why every time you drive your bike I feel like I am the cat. Hahahhahahha I wish. 😆
هل يوجد أشخاص عربيين

You make life beautiful. Thank you.

I think i want to make that crispy chocolate for my moms birthday. Wish me luck guys
Thank you so much for this video. I recently moved and a lot of my friends and family have been giving me a rice. (I mean A LOT of rice. I'm carrying a 5 llb. bag home rn) and im slowly learning what to do with it.
Does this work with any other oil other than canola?
Instead of putting the rice in the chocolate after you put it in the mold, couldn't u mix the rice and chocolate together before to make it even distributed?
i am so impressed that you made this EVEN this that aesthetic wow jun
can it still work even if dont deep fry it
kedilerin bile ağzı sulandı
That is how one gets Cats to behavior properly: one allows them to smell things and know what they are.  That way they are very unlikely to climb on counters where and when they are not wanted and it might be dangerous for them.  Treat them with respect for who they are and what they can do well, the ability to smell much better than any human, and they tend to behave respectfully towards us as well.
Здорово!!! Какой вы молодец! Столько интересного узнаешь из ваших видео! 👍👍👍👏👏👏
now I wanna make this
Do I have to use canola oil or can i use any other kind of oil?

It's rice in America different? Mine didn't pop. I didn't see you cook it first. Did I miss that step?
Hi to my uncle
Of course his family has a farm, he gets everything from there!
Kitties are so cute, well mannered and curious.
Looks great Jim! You both are a great couple! New subscriber here!😊
Gonna try this!
When I show the dog the ingredients as I'm cooking, even if they're onions, he tries to eat them.
Oooowww que hermosos gatitos! Me suscribo 🥰 🇲🇽

How many likes on this comment Is how many people will go to Jun's café if he opens one.

為什么我会收到这些廣告，我從来沒加入你们?
Aznromeo got that for Christmas
So you made rice Krispys
First time to see that you can make a popcorn out of rice
The cats are the masters of smelling food
Fun and creative! I have ever known popcorn, but today I know poprice.
Home made Neslie's Crunch.
A better way is put the rice, in a strainer and then into the oil. When it's all popped remove the strainer from the oil and let it drain. Then scoop it out of the strainer  et voila.
Your videos are so likable!
This is too fancy for me
So rice crispies
Hey I love your videos you make so much interesting food one day im try and make food like you btw you should start a shop Juns Unique Foods also love you Haku
Love me some homemade rice krispies

When jun say popcorn rice, it really is came from rice field, iam so amazed with him
Hey guys does anyone know which brand of hot plate/stove he uses on his videos? Thank you very much!
For those of us who have only gotten our rice already processed in the supermarkets, an explanation of what that machine did that you poured the farm harvested rice into when you first got back to your home.  Are  unpopped kernels of rice hard (as popcorn kernels are)?
I have the anxiety that his cat might eat the chocolate.
Gracias por compartir este video en español...saludos desde Bolivia🇧🇴.
I'm European and we also have a cereal made of puffed rice
Japanese rice is the best
Thank you so much
can any rice be used to do this or does it need to be a certain type of rice?
You should do thick/milk shakes for Rachel  Good idea😁
So beautiful!  Where do you live?
おかしい試してみたら焦げただけで弾けない…
Bruh whenever I watch Jun everything so clean😂
Imagine pop corn rice but with Belgian chocolate 🤤🤤🤤 I hope you could, one day, get some... (if you did aleready, change my sentense to "get some again", it doesnt matter)
It’s even better when you realize he made homemade Nestle Crunch candies
Aku mah apa cuma 'Remahan rengginang' 😂
I felt sorry for the rice first estate. It was more healthy and fresh.
Rachel:hey jun help me open this chocolate ba-  Jun: *slices it into half with a knife*
DO YOU JUST HAVE RICE GRINDING MACHINES LOCATED RANDOMLY IN JAPAN!?
Too pretty to eat
In india we call it as kheel and is used in diwali indian festival because we celebrate harvest of rice.
ok...boiling oil and that cat so near it is a really dumb and dangerous idea
Fiquei preocupada com o gatinho!!!!! Pois o gatinho tava muito perto da panela de fritura.
Don't let your cats eat chocolate because it's bad for they☺️( even with dogs)
猫が火傷しそう、流石に危険では？
waooo it looks very good 😀 i love the decoratio also 😍
No she is popcorn
I am going to have to use your recipe now. I love puffed rice and had no idea you could cook it in the home. Also, your cats are really cool!
Are you Japanese?
YAY POKI IS NOT STEALING STUFF. Lol.
should have called it poprice
Sei bravissimo!!!!!!
Интересно, сколько у него кошек)))
Is that basmati seed? Or popcorn, kekcorn, rice I don’t know what kind this type? I mean I own plant too ❤️

Hello JunKitchen, Thanks for the beautiful video of the pop rice, always with the adorable cats!. Can we make it with integral rice also?.   Best regards. ClaudioSerraBrun (Argentine-Spanish). Yecla Murcia Spain. https://www.youtube.com/user/poesur
ポン菓子だあ
No Brasil se chama flocos de arroz
Greatest and easy. Not oven,
And... with food do you recommended? or is it a simple like popcorns?
I love your idea! I did not know your channel on YouTube anymore now I am enrolled. Thanks
You can make puffed rice by just putting rice with husk in a heated terracotta pot.. It will pop just like popcorn.. No need for oil or butter.. That's the way we make in my home. Really healthy too.
猫を画角に入れたいばっかりで危ない油のそばにおくなんて
You can use normal rice for that right ?
A cultura Japonesa é minha segunda cultura favorita! 💚💛💙
Omg! It's awesome 🖤 and the cats are beautiful! Thank you for sharing

I love this idea! And, I love your knife! Thank you for sharing a part of your day with us!
i just fell in love with your two cats
etraf battı
That’s SOOO MEAN. You invite the kitties to dinner, let them smell it, and take it away.   So well behaved, poor things ...they deserve a treat!   How about some smelts,  sardines,  bacon?
I shall try this.  I believe I will try to make it the way popcorn is made, usually not deep fried.  The difference between popcorn and other varieties is that the skin on the popcorn kernel is not porous. The rapid build of steam from the moisture inside the kernel builds up enough pressure under the non porous skin, it explodes. So, I must also try this with brown rice to see the effect of the outer cover of the rice grain, to see if it pops more or less consistently than white rice. I have several varieties of rice in the cupboard.  This will be fun. Puffed barley is pretty interesting as well.
Over here in Germany, we have a brand of chocolate-coated puffed rice that's called "Nippon". It's quite nice.
Love your videos! You are such a great cook and have super ideas :)
Я единственный русский или нет?
I love the cats in your vidéo! And the rexcipe too of course 😉😋
This food name is cengkaruk
hyyyy i love ur cats
Wow hai un canale stupendo! Nuova iscritta, se ti va passa da me

Canola oil is dangerous.
Cadê os br ??? Receita vegan pleeease
Always wondered how rice is puffed/popped guess I now know, also the intro was beautiful🙏
Надо будет приготовить
👍👍👍🤗
🐈🐈👍👍👍
Nice video, love your cats they are so cute and well behaved, love the fact that I didn’t know you can deep fry rice!
Amazing!!!
My cat would eat the chocolate. He loves sweets, funny because cats don’t have receptors for sweets.
이미 한국이 만들었는디..
Pop rice
I saw a method once that involves heating sand in a big metql bowl (the finest the better), then throwing in the rice and shake it until the rice pops. After that you just sift the sand and take the rice. It seemed quicker and a lot less messier. Any chance you can try this method?
Jun could literally cook a brick and id probably still want to eat it
Ouu,what a beautiful knife...🤗😎
ポン菓子かな？
Now make some popcorn shrimp.
OMG, you are an artist. And a gentle man.  😘😘😘 Where do you stay? BTW 🤔
What a beautiful knife!!!!!
The rice is so cool it's almost a full circle :o
So you made a crunch bar?
Well then Snap, Crackle, and Pop, you have some new competition.
And that's how I learned how to make crunch bars at home!!!
Que lindos tus gatitos 🐱
Hey bro in India we make puffed rice without using oil
To have a chocolate moment, you should be using real chocolate. Engage your brain and get information. Hershey crap is NOT chocolate. Wake up from your delusion!
How did that orange and white cat turn into a black and white cat?
I love how your floofies supervised you through the entire video. Going to have to try this.
I had no idea it was so easy to make lol
There's so much that I love about this video! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ur cat seem lik hitler
So cool to see the effect on the rice stalk! When the cats were near that boiling exploding rice bomb I cringed tho.
Выглядит вкусно😋
جميل وسهل 😍
Pop rice
Porque ele dá a comida primeiro para os felinos cheirarem?

Firstly I want your cats and secondly I want your knife please.lovely video many thanks
튀밥이랑 비슷하구만

Canola oil..!¿? = cancer..☹
Very beautiful
Я думала сейчас всю эту красоту принесет на подносе спящей тян, но нет - слопал сам)))
Your very handsome, and talented and you have a very soothing voice.......fan crushing 😍
What to do when rice have pesticides on it??
jun is so clean and special
Que vídeo lindo e saboroso,que gatos maravilhosos parabéns !
What type of rice do you recommend for this? Looked like short grain for sure,  but is it sushi rice, or...?
love the cats .. puff rice is good too
4:14 cat: ahh yes gimme th..hey bruh, wtf? ಠ_ಠ

Omg you messed up  all over kitchen  😱 nop i cant handle this video . The idea of poprice very nice but oil dropped everywhere.   Anyway best thing i can do that cleaning my kitchen which there is already clean.  Bye 😑
I think your black and white cat is secretly hitler
Love it.  Thanks for sharing 🌷🌷🌷
Wow this is awesome I like your chanel
Hi Juns !!!
Olá! Infelizmente falo somente português (Brazil). Mas quero dizer, assim mesmo que seu canal é lindíssimo, com produção, trilha e imagens impecáveis... sem falar nos gatos (amamos!). Temos  160 gatos, todos resgatados de abandono... muito trabalho e muita luta para cuidar deles! Que Deus abençoe você e seus lindos e amáveis filhos peludos! Beijos Lili  e Caco
おじさんが　お米を作っている農家なんて羨ましい
Canola oil is garbage oil. Sunflower seeds= sunflower oil. Olives=Olive oil. There is no canola seed. Science takes rapeseeds genetically modifies it to call it canola oil. Frankenstein genetically modified crap. You got fresh rice from ur uncle. Use a healthy organic nongmo oil!
Your cats are just adorable <3 And the presentation was perfect with the puffed spike 👌
I love the way, his pets stay right next to him, Starring at what he's doing, but I'm not sure that's a natural conduct, my cats, they're like crazy, it's just weird for me how peaceful the are all the time :/
Those rice machines looked amazing what else did they do x loved the video x
You're a so beautifull person ^^ <3
Que rico se ve !!!! Y ame a tus gatitos muy ordenados
<3
jaki to rodzaj ryżu? kupię taki w Polsce?
Omg haha — I always let my cats smell my ingredients too,while I’m cooking!
Konichiwa, I just ended up first time to watch 2 videos of yours and I want to tell you that I enjoyed this glimpse on japanese landscape, culture and daily life. Ive learned so much more than just puffing rice. :)) Thank you so much! Arigato!
外国の方だったんだ。てっきり、日本🇯🇵の人かと笑笑笑笑
NICE KNIFE !!!! 👍   What an enjoyable video !  I always wondered about puffed rice.

ポン菓子みたいな物か…
Muita gordura nessa pipoca😀

Did Baku sit in his basket the whole time you were harvesting
Can i use ordinary rice? Or is it special rice for popping?
What a shame to polish that rice   :( can we still use brown rice  ?

猫の方にポップライスがとんでった様に見えたけどだいじょうぶ？？
We just simply roast  the rice along with chaff in hot sand or salt.
Это так прикольно, надо будет самой попробовать сделать)) А ещё у тебя котики милые))

ねこはどんな気持ちで匂い嗅いでるんだろう

Sure hope you don't actually feed any of that chocolate to your cats; it's toxic to them! Also to dogs and especially birds.
он так красиво в колосе открылся))

Me encantó tu receta.  saludos desde (Colombia)
I hope you dont eat popcorn with a spoon normaly
Очень красиво)
爆米香
ポップライスのクランチチョコかぁ。  私は塩で頂きたいですね。
お米のポップコーンって、ポン菓子とは違うのかな？ ポン菓子は圧力で弾けさせてるっぽいけど。
I missed it - sid you put raw or cooked rice in the oil?
So schön machst Du das immer
Riquísimo!!!!
It’s scary seeing the cat so close to hot oil, I couldn’t watch till the end.sorry
Это конечно круто все , но что за масло канолы?  И какой рис нужен?  Особый сорт или любой? А обычное масло не подходит? Столько вопросов. ......
Looks great but I would never eat over at your house you put all the food in front of the cats
👍👍👍
Какие морды у них заинтересованные,  как будто понимают всё.😻👍💞
猫、油飛んで痛くないのかな
Wow
Huh. In the UK we would reverse the recipe and have a bowl of puffed rice and just add chocolate to it. Like chocolate Kristie treats? Will be trying this after shopping tomorrow’s I think
Genio
Çikolata paketini açarkenki coolluk der susarım.
Ben de pirinç patlağnı fabrikasyon ürün sankıyodum. Adam bildiğin pirinci kızarttı.
У вас потрясающие коты)
Jun, I hope you'll give us more of these videos: I only just discovered this channel of yours, and each video and what you do and how you do it are all a work of art. Exquisite through and through. Thank you so much for delighting our souls :)
Awesome! How many cats do you have?
Your house it's so beautiful !!! The cats too !!
If he open a restaurant say in the comment how much guys and girls will go in he’s restaurant
Nem imaginava que se podia fazer flocos de arroz dessa maneira,mas o que eu mais gostei no vídeo foram esses gatinhos lindos,que enriqueceram  ainda  mais a beleza do seu cenário! Parabéns pelas escolhas 😉
So is it like rice crispies ?
Oishii!! Tabetai naa!! Chokoreto crurisupi !!🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🍫🍫🍫
your voice is so cool
Me encantan los ayudantes de cocina 😻👼😽😸😹😻
Using Hershey chocolate is like using cow poo 💩. Please use real chocolate next time. 😊
now i'm totally wondering how Jun sets up for aerial views of his camera haha
不能給貓吃巧克力！ 提醒一下(・_・;)
Rice Crispies?
In the UK we have puffed rice as a cereal, I’m not sure about other countries though 😊
真似して作ったら焦げました!😭 普通のお米じゃ出来ないんですか??

Настолько атмосферные видео. Ты крут!💕
Me: Popcorn rice? Jun: Yeah... Me: Rice Kris- Fans: stick with the name!!
I love your Videos and your Cats ❤️
you are the ONLY ONE to have made this recipe on youtube, a small taste of your originality!
rice need special, or regular from the store?
ポン菓子っぽい！バター醤油で頂きたい…
In Thailand we call it "Puffed Rice" but we will mix it with sugar instead of chocolate. It's really delicious. 😋😋
Comment ...Which one is  your favourite cat ?

This genius of a man just figured out how to make a homemade nestle crunch bar. Legend.
Your channel is the best. 😍
Sei un grande mi hai fatto scoprire un nuova ricetta continua così

I got a Gordon Ramsey ad right before this
What's your job how do you make money I'm curious
так приятно осознавать, что где-то в мире есть такая красота, чистота и спокойствие. привет из россии
Such an amazing talent! Also very artistic ;D
We have been doing this in The Philippines for hundreds of years ... we do it with "rest rice"!
Интересно с гречкой так получится?
95% watching and then eating mikrowave popcorn. 5% watching and making an effort and life instantly seems to have all these possibilities.
You are a true artist. I see so much beauty in your videos. I don’t have to cook anything you make. It’s enough to feast with my eyes.
Its 2019 Juns Kitchen has 4 million subs and 4 million views thats a real gamer moment

お米ポップコーン…コーン…米…ポップライス！(？)
sehr schön gemacht. Sehr ästhetisch und professionell. ..und Deine Katzen sind süß :-) Danke für das Video
So...  Asian-styled popcorn?
Koyok rengginang
Poki was immediately onto all kernels that flew his way. Wasn’t sure if he was afraid of being hit, or missing out on a treat.
in india we make this puffed rice without oil
Ganz kurze frage ist das normal dass seine videos alle deutsch betitelt sind???
How can people disliked this video? C'mon this is veryyyyyy cutttteeeee
I can describe the amount of peace the videos give me
I burn my rice because i put my rice with the oil then turn it on but i should have just put the oil and then turn it on then ada the rice And so i was salty so i just cook some ramen instant witch some thing i can do in cooking and Made my self happy lol
How are you.........cat.

猫危ないw
Your videos give me life  Not being dramatic tho ♡
Is it hokosima rice? Pelece anser no
はじめませって
In my country, it's call rengginang :v
You can tell which cat is Jun's least favorite. On one hand you got Haku who is outside, on a beautiful sunny day, enjoying being biked through the gorgeous countryside, and just chillin in a basket as Jun farms some rice, while Poki has a front row seat to the hot, popping grease show.   (I'm just jk around, I know you both 💖 all your magnificent kitties!😜)
Its rice crispies
Hey I cant wait to make this at home! Iiked and subbed!
Krass das Zwilling so weltberühmt ist das sogar Jun die in seiner Küche hat. Aber Ein Damast-küchen Messer ? uff (money money money money money)

I remember making pop rice when I was a child but without oil, I just put it on a small frying pan and heat it ＞ω＜
Which rice is best for popping?
I really wanna try this now! I never knew about this before
Is it me or his knife looks like a shark?
パンパン豆みたいになるのかと思った…
Doesn't that hot oil fall on you??? Actually I am so scared of oil as I had a few burnts!!!
Looks like a beautiful, peaceful life🌻
Japan is so cool!
You always take such pride in the food you make and it is extremely admirable! I enjoy watching your videos. Rachel and you are such an inspiring couple. Keep making these beautiful videos, the world needs the beauty you guys are bringing to it!

Hi Jun. Im from Indonesia. Just slightly more modern compare with Indonesia. Padi. Japan is beautiful. I love your cats. Padi corp make me feel we are like brother.
That is just about the freshest rice someone can get...
Poki !
파팣파팝팦 초등학생때 옥수수팝콘 만들며 난장판 만든 기억이 새록새록 ㅎㅎ good
Poki's face, are you nuts doing that near me!

Roses are red voilets are blue i loves June's kitchen so do you.
Haku is always so chill
Omg u r so creative and a true chef I wish o was good as u just.....so amazing 😯😯
This video is from a year ago..but.. in America we have a very popular cereal.  The name brand is rice crispys (cereal) and a lot of people make “rice crispy treats’ which is butter, melted Marshmallows and the cereal, I’d love to see your take on it!
It's kinda looks like মুড়ি???মুড়ি is a Indian food but I think it's fried by sands not oil🤔🤔🤔🤔
ที่ไทยเรียกว่าข้าวพอง 😊
Im asian and i always eat rice but never thought of this
My house stove sparks about 4 times per sec
King Poki
these videos are the only thing keeping me calm and sane during finals week :P Any break I have, I spend here, thank you so much!
What type of rice is used?
I Was always wandering how it's made.
great idea for preparing popcorn rice ,and your amazing cats of course <3
why would anyone anywhere hate this dude??
Thank you for this amazing atmosphere of Japan. I love all your videos because of that.  P.S. Sorry for my bad English
I love all your cats 🐱 they are so cute and adorable 🐈
you got such a pretty hands hihi
Kids when they play Minecraft and not fortnite:
So it’s rice krispies (only brits will know)
***poprice
Your videos are aesthetic and calming yet also educational and intriguing. Amazing work!
In norway this is a typical christmastreat called ricepuffs where we make puffed rice with chocolate into balls. My favorite <3
I love poki😊  He’s so adorable
In INDIA we call it muri ..though we make it in a different way.
I love how confused Poki looks
This dude really just made crunch bar chocolate blossoms 😂
What's place are you live
pop corn rice? what was the PRICE....do you get the joke popcorn and rice combind...no? ok
I like how videos aren’t too long also he explains everything so well.
I really love Haku <3
rengginang?
It looks like rengginang (?)
Now I need to make this.
I wish I could get my cat to calmly ride in a basket. He's just too high strung.
my rice in (indonesia) is a different rice :/
anvorgesa
Where can i get a man like this ?
you’re so amazing jun!!! i have no idea how you don’t get scared with rice popping like that
i tried...      and burnt the rice :/
Now that’s what I call fried rice
Actually, Indonesia kinda have it too. But it's a little different. We make it from rice and make like "hamburger" shape but loosely, not packed tight, and then we dried it under the sun until it theoretically harden and "turn back" into rice but with a shape, after that we fried it. It's called Rangginang. We usually made it from leftover rice.
Awesome
I used to eat puffed rice cereal as a child. Your video was very interesting.
Your videos are so mesmerizing!!!
Hey Jun brother we make it without oil in India,try it out someday
We call them Rice Krispies
Where's the rose chocolate tutorial 😭
한국어 자막 파파파팍ㄱ 뭐냓ㄱㅅㄱㅅㅋㅋㅋㄱㅅㅋㄱㄱㅅㄱㅅㄱㅅㄱㅅㅋㄱ
Dislike button people were the ones who got too hungry watching the video and though it was the like button...   Or maybe even a 'drop here for food delivery' button.   Juuuust kidding.  As always. Love the videos!
I need a tutorial on How to get a Guy like Jun
i will try to find that pop rice in my country, so i can try to make that because it looks awesome
Goes well with chocolate you say?????
The cats looked hungry at the end
But you cook only Japanese?
Hello! Does it work with any kind of rice? I mean I’m from México and I don’t know if the rice is the same. Thank you.
When he opened the chocolate-satisfying He is so skilled
j'ai vu le  chat noir se lecher les babines, un vrai gourmet 😂
2:04 Poki looks mesmerized.
Learning new food every video 😊
In indonesian it's called rengginang
Indonesia:Renginan
What kind of rice though..?
2:10   I damn well know Jun had a shield while filming that oil warzone.
I tried to make this and ended up burning rice. I'll stick to just watching other people making food from now on, I am terrible at cooking.
i hope you will create more video :((
So cute i love ur cats
Quite honestly jun might have made me decide I wish to go to japan and learn to cook there because it is not food ,as is in america, it’s art
We make this with sugar caramel and make them Into cute form. Delicious
Are you even real
Your video makes me wanna live in Japan
.....it's art!
I'm scared that one of your cat might accidentally taste the chocolate.
😻😻😻
In Hungary we call it "pufi rízs" wich means puffed rice :D
Wow. You live in such a nice place it is actually mesmerising
Does this work with different kinds of rice?
what a beautiful place .... may be my ideal town
You said the puffed rice is doing well together with chocolate, but what is not doing well with chocolate 😂🍫🍫
Jun, how the hell do you cook so good?
This is perhaps the most greatest channel I came across on you tube
Don’t feed cats store chocolate, it’s poison for cats and others
Everything in this video is so pretty and smooth looking like even opening a chocolate bar is so satisfying
why did i read p()rn rice 😂😂
Where did you get that fancy knife?
I bet most people watch this for fun not to learn how to cook.
You are a great cook my guy
kitchen knife - factory new damascus steel
Is it weird if I eat popcorn with chopsticks?? It is a major habit 😂
In Norway we eat it like a cereal, often with jam
한국어 자막 귀엽고 웃겨ㅋㄱㅈㄱㄱㄱㄱㄱ 규ㅠㅠ
Hay thế
Smart presentation 👌👌
this is how it works @myvirginkitchen
In Indonesia its called rengginang
Wooooo poki finally got to join the videoooo!
I just asked the question in my head: "Does he bake the chocolate rice popcorn or freeze it?" Then I realized it's chocolate....
That looks fancy
wait you can use any type of rice???
Common people just produce their own rice??!!!
I've expected Poki to cause chaos but he's being more mature and that's a nice touch uwu
Tried this one, but my rice not popping out,,,it turns to black lol
Wooooaaa these cats are bilingual! They can understand both English and Japanese!!
Hello. I am Thai. I like your video so much. See every clip.
it’s so soothing, i love it 😍🥰
Oh my gosh how do you do this! You’re so creative I just found your channel and I love it!! I’m obsessed!
Me, Asian, Always eating rice from little, using rice as main carb food. After watching this video : i feel failed as an asian
Puffed rice? Nah, in Indonesia we call it 'Rengginang'. You probably should try to learn and cook it Jun!
Pop rice might as well be popcorn for when I’m on a diet
Our rice here has a longer, thinner shape than yours..
In indonesia we call that food is rengginang
In the philippines, it’s called pinipig
It’s called popcorn actually how I know it’s because I am English
確か..................駄菓子のにんじん......の中身ですよね？

Why does this video calm me? 💕 YOUR VIDEOS DESERVE NO HATE. I looooove all of your content.
In Asia when your going to a movie you will just see people with popcorn rice
I Love your vídeos  Eu amo seus vídeos :3 {\ _ /} ●  w ●
Ooohh this looks so good!
4:21 poki
do you know why the cats licked their nose after u let them smell it. its to erase the smell. u cat abuser. (lol)
Окей, теперь я больше понимаю фразу про три хлеба: рис, кукурузу и пшеницу. Интересно, а можно сделать пшеничный попкорн?
#Junskitchen I love how you let Haku, Poki and Nagi smell the ingredients! It's adorable! I love your videos and also I am a big fan of you both!
You can use salt or sand method also
Wow! this looks tasty! Have you ever tried making Champorado before?... it's kinda similar to this, but different cooking procedure. Try looking it up and make it yourself.
I love how he lets his cats smell the food before he eats it, its like he wants them to approve of it before he dines lol.
Yum 😋
Boi I JuSt BuRn DoWn My KiTcHen Lol
Wow, use drone to shot now!
This actually looks really good
You are amazing,georgeous video,love it
i love poki😍😍😍👌💕
In America we call it rice crispy
Man Japan's scenery looks really awesome.
Any rice will do or that fat short grain will do only?
It reminds me of that pingu episode where they throw it in and starts making popcorn
0:16 was it nagi or haku?
Thicc rice grain
not a cat lover but i would not risk having my pet next to hot oil ,wake up man
My god you are the aesthetic in person. It flows through your blood
I love your show Jun!

Rico,rico,rico... Jaja
The puffed rice looks alot loke the popcorn you get at the bottom of the bag
Poki 💓

I want to live in your village
Does it only work with that tipe of rice or oil ?
🇧🇷 nem sabia q dava pra fazer pipoca de arroz. Gostei!
Your videos are soooo calming and relaxing

Poki is lovely
All I got was burnt rice

고양이를 옆에 두고 기름을 끓이는 정신 나간 쉐프~^^
Back in elementary school when we had end of semester ending(or something like that) the mom of one in my class used to make puffed rice with white chocolate for desert.
Please stop using auto tranlation on your video titles. I don't even look what the video is when i see auto translation and i belive there is people who hates it more than me
Ive seen so many of your videos that im starting to feel like one of your cats.
Perfect
That popping sounds so satisfying! 😍
Careful with the chocolate cristallization, it can become really ugly and bad tasting.
love ur channel!
4:25 double mlem
こんにちは私はアラブ人です、そして私は日本語がとても好きです、そして私はあなたのビデオそして私が日本語を理解しているものさえフォローします、しかし私はグーグル翻訳者を使いました

Ahhh rice, the basic food of all foods in asia
Japan's technology is super cool
Where do you live it is so beautiful
You are chef?
Wow! Even your cats look like they want to eat the rice too! Yum, I hope one day I can cook this when I have enough time!
Thanks to you Jun my roommate's love me . Probably because they like this food
It seems very delicious!
I melted my strainer..... 😥😒 Yeah I don't cook much
A Machine  In Japan On the street That cleans rice That's super customer friendly For free  Why does Japan always have those tiny things that's always the coolest shit?
Jun can even make rice bubbles sophisticated

How can he make something this simple look so beautiful
Wait do we have to use rice right from the farms or can we just get them from grocery stores? Does it matter?

ข้าวพอง
Meiji 😍😛
Is Haku, Poki, and Nagi ever eat your cuisine while you cooked? tasted the food not just smell it ...
So this is how they make rice crispies!
한국어 자막 감사합니다만 효과음이 조금 개그스럽게 들어가는게 아쉬워요...ㅠㅠ몰입도가 깨지네요..흑
I’m gonna start a channel when I’m 20 (6 years away).I need some ideas if I want to cook.But I can’t really cook well because I have fidgety fingers and anxiety which makes it bad to cook.
In Australia, they're called Rice Bubbles and they were my favourite cereal when I was growing up. Lol now I know how it's made. Thanks, Jun! 🙌
i call that KARAK
So you use rice that hasn’t been cooked yet and then put it in the oil till it pops right?
你家猫都馋了，每次都只给闻不给吃，小心猫咪造反
Where are you from? Ты говоришь по русски? Какой твой родной язык?
Looks so delicious!✨
Có vẻ ít người Việt xem nhỉ?
That's name Rengginang in Indonesian🇮🇩 :)
Tall boi

The cats are like "What abut mt fuud?"😂
Can someone tell me what kind of plant is that in the white vase? (not the bonsai ... the big one)
Idk y my name is nearly same as yours Jun
In Indonesia, we have something similar and we call them Rengginang, but without chocolate and it kinda sticks together, and also is pretty much a memeable food in here 😂
this is such great quality content
Add Arabic please
All I'm gonna say is Rachel is lucky to have you .-.

I love this video so much. It's so peaceful 🤩😍
แมวน่ารัก
Jun! I made this for my mom and she almost started crying when she ate it because her mother used to make it for her when she was growing up. My family are all navajo (native american) in northern arizona and my momsaid  when her mom went to get the commodities, they would get a lot of rice and her mom would fry it and eat it with her. Im happy you shared this and I was able to make this for my mom and seeing her that happy made my day.
In russia rice pops you

*WELCOME TO THE RICEFIELD!*

한국어자맠ㅋㅋ파파파ㅏㅍㄱㆍ파 폭포폭ㅋㅋ
Poki is actually being a nice boi.
Jun I have a question do you have a favorite knife
In America, we have these snacks called rice crispy treats. They make bars out of the popped rice by making them clump together with marshmallows. Its a nice treat. For added flavor, melted chocolate gets poured ontop to give it another layer of sugary goodness!
This is how u make a crunch bar XD
Do you put salt or sugar on the popped rice?
I ate organic pop rice b4 and it was nice, like popcorn but without flavour
I like your channel !!
Yummmm
Your intos are super
Your videos put me in a good mood!)
👍 thank you for teaching us such nice recipes, here pop rice chocolates are almost in every store, and my childhood fav thing, these days I forgot my happy foods, u reminded me haha 🙂, amazing I can make it on my own now, but do you think I can put salt in poprice to make salty snack?
Oh look so deciduous and beautiful. Your cats so smart , I have one ginger as well , they the best friend 🌹
Hiii
Hiii
Hi Jun! Can you try making a ASMR video of you cutting things up with your cool knives? Thanks!

Poki darf auch mit ins Video 😊😁
Why would you have your cat near boil hot oil and popping rice?!
Cantiknyaaa popcorn😂😂😂
DONT MAKE CATS SMELL CHOCOLATE ITS POISONOUS TO THEM WHY DIDN'T YOU LET THEM SMELL THE RICE?
I'm new to your channel and happy that I found your videos.
does the rice have to be like a specific type or any type of rice will work?
انت رائع😻
What does that person mean?..fake channel ,  virus alert???
Me and my mom do this
Hey, you were teasing the cats with the popped rice. They looked like they might actually want a bite.
I always like your all videos in the starting itself before watching it... 😃 Dont know why!  I am sure that you wont disappoint me😍 lots of love frm India💙
Man you really couldn't do really useful public use machines like that anywhere else but japan.

4:10 WHY?!? Your cats could die from theobromine dosing...
Am I the only one who finds it cute that he lets haku sniff the products?☺️
Puki is on the video
What sorcery is this? I've been eating rice for 20 years and I've never known you can make popcorn out of rice!
а какой рис именно надо ?
I’m surprised your cats didn’t eat the rice. My dog would’ve eaten it in seconds 😂 he loves popcorn (or anything really)
wow, que buena idea ahora para navidad  Saludos desde México
When you pour the rice into that machine after you harvested it, what does the machine do?
Look at cat's face on 4:07

Why does everything that you cook   always end up like a pro/fancy food?!
Hey Jun ! I really love your videos :D  Tell me, what is the gas cooker you're using ? I only have electric cooker and I'd love to use one of those ! Does a gas bottle last for a long time ?  Thanks for all, I'm trying your recipes back in Paris ;D

精米機あるのに親近感
Tried with basmati rice and it didn't work.....:(
Went and bought stuff to make puff rice after this
In Bali, we have something similiar like this but... It's known as "the snack for poor people". We use a leftover rice (mostly from yesterday or 2 days before), then they dry it under the sun for 1 day. We fry them until pop and add some salt. Its kinda sad but nostalgic.
Everyone I watch one of your videos I get hungry. Hmm, must be cause of the cats.
Hey . You are actually so good "at the kitchen " everybody like to see more video on your youtube chanel cause what you do is an awesome - art so we are all appreciate your works on this chanel.
Omg! this channel is the purest thing on YouTube

This is soooo satisfying it’s unbelievable. Another YouTube channel that does this sort of thing in the sense that it creates incredibly aesthetic cooking videos is: peaceful cuisine please go check it out it deserves more love
Finally, a recipe that I can also make #loweffortpeople
Production values of your videos are excellent.
Sanki koklattığın ürünlerden kedilerininde canı istiyor gibi mama dışında o ürünlerden de veriyor musun ?
Your videos can heal anxiety... It's so refreshing
เหมือนข้าวตอกที่ไทยแหละอาจจะ

Who else wants to try this?
Omg Jun your shots are amazing I love your video quality and creativity! I wish I could eat these, or can I with my braces? (Are they less hard than popcorn kernels?)
Is this the crunch part that is in American Crunch Bars??
主人自己吃😑😐
Que bello mmmmmmm😊
BRO MEJI MILK AND CHOCOLATE IS THE BEST
Remember...1st HIT up that Canola oil lol 1:42
Poki is starting to behave so well!!!
3:27 is that a oshaberi doubutsu in the background? (pink dog toy)
I tried his and none of the race popped, I used raw store bought which should be fine.
1:07 are those called "Rice Pellets" ?
こんなおしゃれなポップコーン見たことない😂 そしてチョコをお箸で食べるお上品な方も見たことない😂😂 素敵すぎる。
Man... Rachel is one lucky women to have you
Why there is some people whos dislike this video. I cant get it why
あなたいったい何者なんだ笑
where is this location?
Jun you should own your own restaurant
I'm feel as me see a movie
Rice Krispies!!
so pretty when the rice popped on the stem
Are cats allowed to eat chocolate?🤔
一体どんなところに住んでいるだ？ ジュンさんは
Ooooohhhh sheeeeeee that's how Coco pops are made. Daaaaang why didn't they ever come to my mind???
It has to be some sort of special rice. Normal rice doesn't pop. Does it? I'm certainly trying this. Nope. Any normal rice from the grocery store. I'm trying this. I made popcorn in a pot. I know how to make it. I just want to taste this. Thanks for the idea :)
Que vida mas linda la tuya
精米所！なつかしい✨
チョコとかペロッとしたらどうするんですか？？？ 猫にチョコは危険ってわかっててやるんですかネーーーー？ 無知な人が真似するかもなんで、見てて怖いです
稲の弾け方が見事すぎて  とっても単純な作業なのに 華やかで素敵です！
Автор канала русско говорящий?

He’s so cute i wanna marry him
Hey, brother, you are on the right way: best cats are from the walkstreet (like my tailless linx)! I am walking with sisters cat too. But if you want take an adventure in the midnight you should attache two head lights on his fuselage. Three years ago our cat found a big urchin inside the forest))
Your videos are always so calming and aesthetically pleasing its amazing thank you for making content
Honestly your videos are so calming and peaceful and delicious looking that both my friend and I use them when we are stressed out. Plus cats! So thank you for making these video, they are beautiful and heartwarming! 💜💜💜💜
I appreciate how much effort you put in to making every dish look pretty.
Where do you live? Not address maybe where i can find similar places. I really love the green around you and the fact that you can move with a bike freely and that the city is right next to you! Its so convenient.
It’s really awesome.
when you see poki in the background
Some things I always amaze from your video:  1. Sometimes you can always have your ingredients from around you. I love in order for you to get rice, you are coming to the field and helping the elders on the farm.  2. How technology and socially advance your country is. I once went to Japan and even in the village or outside the city, they have a public-sharing tools for people's prosperity; like the machine you use to make rice.  3. The variety of cooking tools you use that I rarely or never saw it before. Like the one you use in your ramen video and many thing for any different type of dishes.  4. The way you handle and cooking also very clean and professional. Im proud of you.
Is popped rice good for cereal?
누룽지랑 맛이 비슷한가요..?
I assume that the rice puffs taste like rice cereal
Never give your cats Chocolate cuz they will die
เหมือนข้าวตอกเลยแต่มันเป็นข้าวพอง
your vid is so amazing!
Does the rice have to have the shell on it and can you use American rice the long grain
Oh I see poki 😻
Everything you make is so adorable. I love this.
If those public machines were in any other country, they'd be trashed within a week.
I really like Japan..... Love from India....🙏🙏🙏
I love these videos they’re so wholesome and pure
Good to see Poki on the trash cans rather than in them!
Hmm. Never seen that machine where I live. I wonder what the benefits are
rice crispies nani?
corn that pops they called it popcorn so rice that pops you calls it poprice. not popcorn rice
Your English pronunciations have improved so much!
초코릿이 아니라 물이랑 설탕 넣고 끓여서 시럽에 저 쌀튀밥이랑 견과류 넣어 만들거나 물엿으로 해서 만듬 맛있는데 살찌는원인^오^
These videos are so calming like no intro until you start cooking and you biking with Haku over the beautifull landscape of japan and when you start cooking it gets even better the cats watching gives a heartwarming, loving feeling. Overall love your videos you make great content, Keep it up and tell the cats i said hello <3
Dose anyone know if you can make this with regular rice?
Cute cat♡ ^-^
This is too beautiful
will rice pop in popcorn machines?
So pleasant to watch, Japan is so beautiful.
Can you try and make puffed wheat
I bet hes better than ramsay
oh my god. i love rice treats.; this is so beautiful arrrrrrrrrrg. i'MMA GET ME SOME. wait, what kind of rice did you use? brown rice? or does any sticky/asian rice work?
튀밥!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wish I have a cat.
I first thought what's pop rice? Then he said puffed rice. I am Bengali and I was like Awh Muri. XD muri=puffed rice
Your videos always make me smile. It’s so satisfying and you live in such a lovely neighborhood.
That rice machine it the start is so cool. Japan is always so ahead of everyone with their creations. I wish someday I could like it a remote and peaceful place like that oneday. It's would be so nice
Wow that looks good!!!!!!! Can you please make deserts instead of dinner
interesante
Just amazing, as usual. Love your videos but I have to admit I love the cats too. They were saying, "Jun, what the hell man, get that stuff outta my face. Prepare some fish, we don't like rice or chocolate!" :)
4:05 japanese eats chocolate with chopstick

All the dislikes are people mad that he put a chocolate candy by a cats muzzle and letting them smell it.
If u put with choco/ its called champorado? Im not that is it
You are the best
Why I just can't stop watching your each videos?
i mean, now i know how to make my second-favourite childhood cereal?  i'm sorry, it's just, i don't know about the rest of the world, but this is a cereal in the uk that is very much aimed at kids, called "rice krispies" and is marketed with a trio of characters called snap, krackle, and pop. to see it presented with such elegance and care is rather funny, since i'm more used to eating it from an old off-cast china bowl with milk and sugar
This looked so simple that I’d tried it, I ended up burning the rice. Don’t question why
i love so much this channel
ya lo quiero hacer
Japanese rice taste is the best
Your dogs too XD
02:30 It looks like firework, also looks like flower blooming. It's beautiful.
Genial!!! Maestro!!!!
This is fresh as free fresh as you can get rice. Wow
And the cat is staying in the basket until u r back?
Wow 😋
you really are great, a simple dish like this somehow you make it look so good and aesthetically pleasing
My Asian Grandmother would rage if she saw me deep frying rice, but I would love to try this out!
What would i do if the rice is cooked bit doesnt pop

I absolutely love your videos. You do very well with the cooking instructions, you often provide cultural knowledge others don't by just showing the processes, your cats are adorable and it's so relaxed and calm. Thank you for your high quality content Jun.

I live in Ontario, Canada where we see a lot of canola growing. I have seen wild rice growing, once or twice. I really liked seeing it growing, and being gathered and processed. I'm not a popcorn fan but puffed rice would be very nice. I wonder if I could use the hot air machine for popcorn for rice instead. It will be something to look into. Another beautiful dish on a plate with the puffed rice and chocolate. You make it look easy.
Thank you for Turkish translation
my mom said when she was small she was watching her neighbour popping rice up close, and a rice popped to her lip, that leaved her a scar, that's why she got her lip tattooed. wow this rice really does pop far!!
In italia non si chiama riso soffiato😂😂
Opening the chocolate bar with a chef's knife. So smooth. I'm going to do that next time I get a chocolate bar, just for the heck of it.
i am obsessed with your channel and i dont even cook
Kinda looks like rice crispies
I thought Poki was gonna eat the popcorn 😂😂😂

your videos are so calming to watch ah
Poprice
Jun vs chef gordon ramsey👨‍🍳
Perfect! How about parboiled rice fried with a mix of milk butter/cleaned grease and rice bran oil? For someone want to reduce lipid: you can salt (the salt gives us the better thermal property than sand, an it will not make the pop food become saltier so much). However, I prefer your solution - frying. It gives us more fatty taste. In other way, we can use cold matured rice. We can separate mechanically, or use cold water to do it easier (and then we dry). Frying old (matured) rice gives us a equivalent puffed rice.
Everything he makes is bootiful 😍
Why is he lays ssssoooo fancy like instagram level
And allso cool that you let your cats smell those things i always let my cat smell my food😂i think its a good experience for them
I love puffed rice in chocolate😀great vid!

Are they rice crispies?
(Sorry for my english,I'm learning)It seems a lot with a very popular recipe at Brazil. ☺But,here we use the traditional popcorn,and a creamy recipe of chocolate, called "brigadeiro".
Meiji chocolate...              Naiz 👌🏼
Really enjoying
such a nice knife wasted on cutting chocolate :)
This recipe should be a valentine snack
자막 누가 써 주셨는지 정말 유머러스하게 써 주셨네요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Ooh, the filled chocolate is a great idea! Also, what are those two plants in your kitchen? They look really nice.

the beginnings of your videos are always like a wholesome anime intro
This is satisfying for some reason
Can you use that as a cereal or does it have to be coated with something like sugar? I'd love to find a cheap alternative to boxed cereals.
Cool poki  is wise  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 kisses from france ❤❤❤❤❤
아니 이거 자르는 소리까지 자막해주네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Oh Poki watched for a bit nice
Every time I see your Kramer Zwilling chef knife I get lost in the chopping!  Quick question, do you prefer the wider blade over typical chef knifes?  It seems like it may be a bit easier on knuckle control.  I am looking at getting a new chef knife soon, that's why I ask.  Thanks!

Wow! How does that rice machine works? It's so cool!
I love your neighborhood. I really wanna live in a place where i could ripe my own garden.
You're literally live in a real life anime  #sliceoflife
You made me hungry.
I love how well behaved your cats are when you do this. I tried cooking with my cat and she tries jumping on the stove.. When it was on.. How do you do it!!!
No chocolate was harmed in the making of this video

Hi
How have I never heard of this!?
The presentation is  beautiful
I really hope to get an answer on this: can you make this with just normal store bought rice??
고양이 너무 이쁘다ㅜㅜ
I love how over the top Jun is that he can't open packaging like a regular person. No, Instead he has to cut it open with a giant, super sharp kitchen knife! ahaha!

You not a cook... you're an *artist*
Am I the only one who is scared that he might cut his finger??
I eat this in my country, it’s couture
I would have the puffed rice on my soup. It would be good even on a simple soup.

The final dish was so beautiful. I love these aesthetic videos, they're very calming, and Jun's technique is great.
Jun’s knife chopping is so satisfying.

Hi I'm loving watching your videos, your cats are very cute. I have two cats a white female named Hadassa and a male named Baruck he is white with a chocolate balls love them as if they were my children. I'll keep following you! I loved it! Kisses 💕😊😘
Your chanel is incredible, my two hobbies in one chanel, that’s amazing. And all looks so good ^^
Your videos just calm me down. I started off watching this while i was very annoyed and irritated
where did he learn how to cook?
You don't need to dry the rice after harvesting? In my country after manually harvesting the rice we have to dry the rice under the sun for a day or more depending on the weather.
OMG! You lr cats are SOOOO cute! :3

Puffed rice!!?  Witchcraft!!!!!
When you held the net full of popping kernels close to the screen 2:12 , I jumped back like they were going to hit me!
What type of rice do I use?
Must it be that type of peal rice from japan or any rice will do? Thanks
You can upload an eight hour videos of just Haku, doing nothing  in particular, and I would watch it with such enthusiasm. He is too cute and too pretty.
Вау, все так эстетично)
I love meji dark choco 😍😍😍
Hello! I'm from Brazil and I love your channel, it's amazing!!! Congratulations you're awesome 💐
Whoops.. Japanese rice are a bit round while the rice from my country are longer and whiter
I absolutely  love the way the chocolate  came out!　d=(^o^)=b
I like you and your cats 😃
Jun I love your videos to death. They’re just perfect :)
튀밥과는 다른가?
Is there any specific kind of rice? The rice that my family uses in America is much different from what I see you using here. It's very thin and stark white, while yours is smaller and fatter and more dark
Trop bien et coconing ❤️👑🔥😴
Я взахваті ))
Poucos vídeos legendadoooos 😿
Jun, I must ask, did you go to culinary school?
Jun why you dont try the indonesian food
Jun pretty much just made rice crispys
A là người nhật ạ
Your cats are like test sniffers.
This is cool i like it this is my first cooking ever wow
I admire your videos ♥️
Can you use any other oil or...
Pretty cats. Do your cats ever take a bite of something that you didn't think that they would be interested in?
Looks great 👍
Eating chocolate with a chopsticks... the most Asian thing I've seen lately      And I'm Asian
In my country indonesia,it is called "rangginan" 😄

Wow

They are too beautiful to eat.
Very beautiful

RENGGINANG 🤣
So beautiful!
Two of my favorite foods combined!!! 😍😍😍

You did more than just learn how to cook in college. You creat. I’ve been cooking for many, many years and this is the art of cooking. Well done on all your cooking vlogs.
Please do some desserts such as tarts,mont blanc , genoise pleasee
This time im gonna make popcorn with rice . POP RICE
What the???Japan has public RICE MACHINES??
0:58 those hands tho

Ah... Pinipig
These are the most peaceful videos I've ever seen the main reason I love watchinb
Jun loves his knives 💙

Haku ❤❤❤
I can use any rice or what im from morocco what should i do
I would eat this everyday while watching seventeen...
can you make this with a popcorn machine too?
That's fascinating (and romantic), and I'm glad that my next question is already answered by the recommended video (why are your cats so disturbingly docile / how did you train them).
Can you make it with any sort of rice?
Youre cat is fucking awesome
Americans deep fried everything but came back with nothing but obesity.  Japan deep fries one thing and it’s fucking amazing.         disclaimer: fried chicken is also amazing.
I didn’t even know you can use rice to make those! 😶
You let POKI in your video!
Cool
But what if I don't have rice field near me, because I live in Europe? (Sorry if I did a mistake in this sentence)
Wait.....is that black and white cat poki?!??.......i havent seen himaround for like other episodes of jun'skitchen....
Your cats are so nice lol. XD
Kor sub is so funny  :)
How much does rice sell for now?
We already have it in England, but it’s a cereal. Called Rice Krispies :3
i hope i have cat like that 😢
The beginning looks like it’s animated. Amazing. Your videos are masterpieces.
한국어 자막 만든거 누구얔ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㅋ졸졸졸골
I dont know if it was the oil I used or the rice but I tried this recently and it didnt pop that many. About 5 cups of rice tried to pop and only 5-10  percent did. Still very good though
You do *amazing* art
I need a man who can cook and is so nice like Jun 😅
Does any rice work
I have a sub teacher named mr. Jun and he is so annoying and we would make jokes about his name like "here's junny" and he is so sarcastic we don't even know what he is saying so... But I love ur vids but just know that mr. David jun is a bad teacher... FYI.
Who is black and white cat?
น่ารักมากๆ อยากมีแมวแบบนี้บ้างจังเลยค่ะ แต่ที่บ้านไม่ให้จับเลย haha
자막대체ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Would this work as cereal? 😂
THAT POPPED RICE STEM IS WHAT DID ME IN
If I pop by my Uncle's, the maximum I get is a bunch of empty beer bottles
Well, now I'm curious if other cereal grains can be popped too. Corn and rice isn't commercially grown where I live, so that stuff is always imported.  Time to deep-fry some wheat, oats and barley, and see if it puffs. Would be damn neat if it did.
In Scotland where I live these are a breakfast cereal called rice crispies.great vid
Your cats are so cute! !!!!!😺🐱
Question:have you ever thought about opening your own restaurant. I’d go to it!
i didn't know rice could do this
Your cats must be so well trained. You seem to trust them enough to handle chocolate this close to them.
*buys rice* Yeah this will be fun! ..... *stands in front of burning house*

How do u eat cereal with milk...
For some reason the intro reminded me of teletubbies...
I am Indonesian, and pretty much  eat rice everyday since I was born, but I don't know that rice can pop like popcorn :") #themoreyouknow
Wow jun! So cool its just pop rice but so elegant!
Holy shit poki is behaving!
is this the same as rice bubbles??
I love how curious you're cats are about smelling everything
I love puffed rice! In the UK we have it as a breakfast cereal with milk. You can get an unsweetened one, one covered in sugar, or a chocolate coated cereal. And like you did with the melted chocolate, we do that too & call them rice crispie cakes!
You are so creative! 💖
Looks like rengginang, if ur Indonesian you must be know wkwkwkwk :v
I wish I had a machine that prepares the same stuff YUM!!!
ねこぉぎゃんかわ🧡
I just love your knives!
Such beautifully done videos, congratulations.
I'm so confused what the rice machine was
자막 넘나 귀여운것ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
It's cooked from restaurant
I love your videos!
EVERYTHING goes well with chocolate!
How come even your rice looks better than mine lmao....no seriously they look like gems ;-;
Selected Rice 😍😍😍
jun has just bankrupted crunch bars
i really like how u show the rice fields... much advanced than our country, myanmar !
Does he have his own restaurant??
*IS THAT A WEED?!?*
Your videos are so calming.I really liked it ❤️
Watashi wa anata no neko ga totemo kawaī koto o aisuru  *ps sorry if i did anything wrong i am in a curses for japan*

The rice would be so fresh
It looks satisfied.
So sad...delicious, organic brown rice...and he stuck it in a polisher and cleaned off all the bran, and the vitamins in the bran!!
준 💕💕
When you let your cats sniff the chocolate it looked like Haku was eager to sniff it
0:57 oh! What's this machine do? Does it remove the outside layer from the rice? Forgive me, I don't know what what it would be called.
Instructions unclear made pretzels
I know popcorn rice,  i like it 😍
Poki es tú gato normal y promedio XD disfruta más el calor del sol que una silla cómoda, hace desastres y no le importa lo que hagas 💕
where jun chef live? I think is not tokyo,,
i love all your stuff, its amazing, and i love how your cooking includes the cats! not many people seem to involve their pets in stuff like this, so keep doing great stuff!
it looks soooooo good😋
wowwww
Why da f˚˚ck do you dislike
Its like mini popcorn
Jun maybe next time instead putting the pop rice between the choclate you could mix them first so it will contain more rice pop
Lucky cat....*O`•_•`O*
Good thing its not a busted nut
I love your cats!!!

I tried cook with my cat. I just can't cook.
Does the rice type matter?

Maybe your cats will be thinking why you let them sniff your food if you are not going to give them.   I love your cats more then your cooking sometimes. They are just tooo cute to see. There eyes show there curiosity. I love catss

In the video Jun says to use canola oil, but can we use other oils instead?
Man his city is bootyful it all adds up to the cooking. Very well done.
Let’s be honest everything taste better with choclate
Brasil alguém?
His life is like a anime😂❤
He’s so asian that eats chocolate with chopsticks
He put chocolate in front of the cats' faces'...
Thanks for sharing! That rice from your uncle looks so pretty and fresh! Could you please teach us how to make homemade Koji rice? We live in Texas. Thanks again!
Nothing better than your sound....

I'm new to your channel and happy that I found your videos. They're relaxing to watch!
C'est du riz soufflé en fait, non?
it's so cute and adorable how your cats watch you when you cook 😁
Will sushi rice work for this?
Bonjour de France:-)  comment faites vous pour que votre chat reste dans le panier lors de vos promenades à vélo ?
Sugoi sugoi! Subarashi
I got puffed rice in a Japanese snack box, and it was super good! However I don't know where to buy it in America, so this is really a lovely video. Thank you! <3
I love ur videos and ur voice. That makes me feel comfortable.

Thanks for sharing. I think I'll try these recipe. Your cat's are gorgeous. Good to see how you include your cat's in the video. Also, how you allow them to smell the rice before you try it. I'm a cat lady, so of course I enjoyed this video.
Wow that chocolate brand is really *EXPENSIVEEEEEEEEEEE* in my country
I love how you always let your cats sniff your ingredients! I do the same thing with mine. It’s really adorable. I love your videos, they’re very soothing to watch, I really enjoy them!
Aaaah~ these videos are soooo relaxing, i could watch them all day,  you really give of a sense of security, and that really puts me at ease
Can we use popcorn machines?
In my country it's called rengginang.
ข้าวตอกแตก
Nhìn thích thật đấy
Rice crispy the cereal
I see you use a drone. Beautiful camera work! Cute cats!!
what does that machine do? the one he put the rice in
Super easy :D
Wouldnt it be Poprice?
We have something similar to this here in Bangladesh (mostly found in the countryside) but we don`t use oil. You should try that, more healthy lol.
Gordon Ramsy is shook
I love puff rice
Roses are red I’ll take your advice My dinner tonight  Is popcorn rice
That's rice? O.O I thought rice grew in water...
Việt Nam
There’s an alternative way to pop the rice: use hot sand in a wok. No oil needed.   https://youtu.be/tmhpw6tDEDk
Cats can't have chocolate right
My spirit is being healed watching these vids...
i want to try that... but i dont have money to but the ingredients... and Im still young... XD you're gooooodddddddddddddd senpai! Sugoii!
Your videos are so soothing and aesthetic! Idk how to express myself about your videos. I love them! Your cats are so cute!
Wtf is that rice machine? And it's even self-service? Even Japanese farming technology is amazing.
You cook very well,and your videos are awesome, well edit. You cats are beautiful too, I wish healsing and good luck
Rice Krispie treats
*mmmmMMMMMMMM M M M M M M M MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM*
What if yout cats run in and eat that chocolate
meow
When I'm older I'm going to Japan to meet u and also because I've always wanted to go to japan
does it go well with milk because i think it will be a good breakfast
This is so dangerous for cat who is sitting so close to the pan
Bạn là người nước nào ?
本当にキレイだ！ キレイすぎて何か怖いぜぃ..(´・ω・`)
BOO GET OFF THE STAGE CHINA use stuff from Japan they have all the tech
1) Don't fry shit that pops an splatters  WITH A CAT NEXT TO THE FRYING PAN (and don't even bother saying it didn't you can clearly see oil splattering his coat). Omg! Do you have any idea what that cat would have done if just a TINY bit of burning hot oil got on it's sensitive nose or eye RIGHT NEXT TO A BIG POT OF HOT OIL??? Moron... 2) See number 1. 3) You didn't temper your chocolate which means your chocolate sucks. 4) Chocolate is poisonous to cats. 5) eating a piece of chocolate (you literally just un-molded with your hand) with chopsticks is super douchey. You're a douche. 6) It's PUFFED rice jackass. Popcorn? popCORN? Really? /kermit 7) DONT FRY SHIT NEXT TO A CAT IDIOT.
those are some nice rice...
Peace and Love from India 💕💕
お米でポップコーン。て出来るんですねw

A few minutes at the beginning seems to be a movie.
Your food is so good looking it's art
I'm so glad to see Poki.  And looks like he doesn't like rice ) Your videos are great.
Why don't your cats eat it ?
Can anyone confirm for me if they taste good? I've not done this before and i'm curious about this :/
look at poki. he's such a good boy
King of asthetics jesus
i want to become your cat
Dude even opens his chocolate bars WITH his knife.   I bet he ties his shoes WITH his knife.
Which prefecture do you live in ?  I lived in Saitama, Yorii town for 3months volunteering on a farm.
This video, like every video of Jun's kitchen is amazing, but I got way too fascinated by the rice machine. Does it clean the rice?? What an amazing thing!!!!!
The best knife ever!
i think you’re my new fave
Your ways are so helpful and Eco friendly because you hardly use electronics to do the cooking that you do
puta que pariu olha essa qualidade de imagem
In Germany we call it Puff Reis and you can have it in many colors and with fruit flavor
Kitteh approves! ❤️❤️
Theo called ít poprice
ITS SO BEAUTIFUL 0:02     I LOVE IT 🐎
nekoorikoudana
Its so satisfying and peaceful
i love ur videos its relaxing, like, my alternate life if i had as much money as you -- but with my cats! hehh😁
I love how you garnished the chocolate with the popped rice still on the stem! It was so simple and elegant Where did you buy the flower mold you used?
I tried this recepe 5 minute ago, I don't know how I do it, but I actually burned myself and the hot oil fell on the ground, just for a little bit of pop Rice, carbonised. 👍🏻
How come you manage to make something so simple look so good? This makes me hungry just looking at it!
This all too good
What a beautiful knife
có ai việt nam ko
Cool
So is popcorn rice regular popcorn but it’s piped rice instead?     Your videos are oddly satisfying.
Jun show us ur fav knife someday xD
Came for the cats, stayed for the delicious looking foods
Me : why not buy rice krispies
Great
자막 넘 귀엽 ㅠㅜ
Where can I get one of those bike baskets for my cat?
after having reviewed countless documentary evidence, i have determined that the sole purpose of the human species is to entertain cats
God, your plating is gorgeous and your videos are so peaceful
Hello.. Can we do it with any type of rice?
英語すごく上手ですね！羨ましいです どうやって勉強したんですか？
まるでポン菓子みたいだぁ...
in Indonesia we make thousands of foods out of those rice puffs. say rengginang, jipan,
이거 한국어 자막 누가 달았냐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Yep. We call it puffed rice. But I’ve never had it.
i love your videos so much pls more and greetings from germany
I love rice
You are an Artist Jun. Your videos really are a work of art.
Wow! Chinese topic!
匂い嗅がせるのは何故でしょうか？気になってしまう笑
We have puffed rice for breakfast in alot of Europe and possibly America (I dunno)
Fiquei apaixonada pelo vídeo, Parabéns
Man that looks so yummy but my skin would instantly flare up with acne after eating that xo
爆米花
I want to COOK LIKE YOU...😊😊
How does Jun not have a cooking show on television yet
Japan’s chocolate looks so much better than American chocolate 😂😂😂
なぜキャンプ用コンロを使用していますか？キッチンはありませんか？

Que lindos gatitos!🙊❤
Poki! I’m proud of you!”
Words cannot describe the quality of this video. I don't even know what to call it, it's too pure.  Subscribed
*cuts chocolate with knife and eats chocolate with chopsticks* My lord...
I love popcorn rice. It’s one of my favorite snacks and I’m Asian American.
I thinks he’s married ??
What is a darumasag or daurimasag
The cats are like SHIT HE TOOK THE CHOCOLATE
뻥튀기
I just discovered your channel and Im loving your videos, you are very talented!

こんにちは私はあなたのビデオが大好き！彼らはとてもかわいいです！  Kon'nichiwa watashi wa anata no bideo ga daisuki! Karera wa totemo kawaīdesu!
Im so jealous of your cooking skills. Holy shit! Just discovered the Channel by a cat video and I'm glad I clicked it.  Now I need some help to not explode out of euphoria *-*
Too bad he didn't use that one knife
猫ちゃんがすごくおとなしい
Wished we could eat more locally sourced foods in America.
저기 어디에여?
Mano seus vídeos são da hora demais eu apreciei ele demais seus vídeos mas eu não entendi porque você coloca lá certos títulos em português e alguma jogada de marketing?
العربي لايك
Your lifestyle is my dream lifestyle
Can we do this with just normal supermarket rice?
Eat them with milk. In Australia (where I'm from) they're called rice bubbles and they're eaten as cereal
Your cook is so good! and tasty and i really want to eat it :D
Butiful demascus blade
As of now, 765 dislikes?? What's wrong with people?? Just dumb fuckers! (Trolls). I wish you were my personal cook! Thanks for your videos.
Also, my dad has that knife!
Everything goes well with chocolate!
Só tô aqui pelos gatos
I am Arab. I like your videos. I think we have( as Arabs)  many things in common with Japanese food and culture.
I love how you let the kitties smell the food 😂 their reactions are so adorable
Another beautiful video & an oishi one too I’m sure☺️ just love how u “incorporate” the kitties into everything ... they all so handsome!
I've been planning on moving to Japan. What city is that? It seems so peaceful and nice
Your cat Soo cuteeeee on from indonesia
In England those are called rice krispies
Asian popped corn
เป็นอะไรกับคนไทยหรอครับ ถึงได้เขียนภาษาไทย I love cat and food ^^
Just found my new favorite channel! I'll be patiently waiting for your newest video :)
Would this work with long grain paraboiled rice too?
They are soooo cute!!!
That's a beautiful place where you live and love your vids
AMAZING!
How do you get your cat to stay in the basket if your bike???
The beginning reminds me of Fortnite
Your cats are well behaved...you prepare  everything so neatly n with passion..love your video. Great presentation  too 😍
I'm supposed to be sleeping dammit 😛
JE T'AIME!
wow
Cocoa krispies in a nutshell
I know you live in Japan but the little town is so beautiful
Could you add marshmallow to the puffed rice in order to make rice crispy treats
*🅱 E E P   🅱 R I E D   🅱 I C E *
cats + chocolate = dead cats simple math
That knife you have is beautiful! Is it Damascus?
poprice
man i need to visit this place sometime
ポキが跳ね落ちたやつ食べてて可愛い
Great to see a new video from you, thanks for the recipe. I had never thought to make my own chocolates also it must be awesome to be able to grind your own rice, certainly couldn’t get fresher and no doubt tastier rice.
Poor Poki getting the rice all over him.
You can mix sugar with the rice and it will be tastier
You make cooking look so elegant and intriguing. I hope there’s a video on how you got started and what’s been inspirational.
Your videos are so satisfying, kinda makes me sleepy..and that's a good thing. :D
вот у тебя названия некоторых видео на русском, а почему сам не говоришь на нём в видео?
Mostly...it’s home made coco pops.
Does it work with a rice which isn't Japanese? En tout cas bravo pour tes vidéos ! From France
I tried this and ot was amazing! So delicious!❤️❤️
I love where you live man! I’ve lived in the city all my life, so I’m kinda jealous of people who live in the country and have such peaceful lives with peaceful jobs. Love your videos anyway. ✌️
Beautifully made video once again Jun!!
ALL I NOTICED WAS THE CHOCOLATE BEAUTIFUL CHOCOLATE  CATS TOO, I LOVE CATS
Do you use camera filters or is the grass really that green?
Very nice, I love 💗 your car, your videos and your channel 😉
Bro where you live? It's beautiful
You should make asmr cooking 😍😍
Where’s the butter?
Could I use jasmine rice?
He eats a chocolate snack with chopsticks haha
動画見るたび撮影高度上がっててすごい…
In my country its called pinipig
한국어 자막 너무 귀여워요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ챂챂챂ㅍ!!
Jun your so talented Rachel must be so luckily live with you
"Don't have to make a mess" is clearly relative, given how much rice keeps popping out of the oil! XD
almost everything is perfect, it seems u enjoying the cooking.
THAT LOOKS GOOD
Am I the only one that thinks that these videos are really soothing?
今度家でもつくてみよっと
I have never been so envious of a cat.
Hi Jun!  For Valentine's this year, I took inspiration from both you and Rachel! I made chocolate from scratch like Rachel did (from 2015), but I also decided to add my own little fun and use pop rice (or rice crispies cereal as a substitute) like Jun did here to make my Valentine chocolates. They came out really well.  My beta tasters and Valentine really loved them. ^^ Thanks for being such a huge inspiration!
I didnt know rice can pop 😱 niiceee
is it Like Rice Krispies
Who the heck gives thumbs down to this please? It's cats and delicious food!!! It's chocolate! Jeez people are crazy...
If i had a sister I'd make sure she married you
I love that whatever weather it is you just have to do a bike ride with haku at the beginning of the video. lol
😍😍👌👌
ooh nice video~
That's is your uncle jun?
Puffed rice in milk is my favorite!
The chocolate in Japan looks better than the chocolate here in America!
I am loving this ❤️
I'm m O I s t
OMG the knives fam its $200 to $400 I can't afford those nor can my parents (they won't spend so much on those knives except for my dad) :)
this is so extra for some rice and chocolate I love it
I’m surprised to see Poki there
You are AWESOME. I love the relationship you have with your cats
I'm binge watching your videos now...love your videos..and your 🐈..greet from Indonesia
It's like you live in anime world
I love your videos and not just because you have your beautiful cats in them either.lol
いつ見ても高画質だなぁ
Wait...Do you speak Dutch?
I knew you can do it by yourself. My mom never tried to and was saying "impossible, they have special machines for it".
Cool
what is puffed rice called in your language ? in Bengali (Bengal is the eastern region of India) it is called 'muri' .....
What is that machine that you put the rice into?
Japanese people are amazing !
i didn't watch this video is it any good?
In India in Wast Bengal it found everywhere it called pure in Bengali
that tree behind he is weed or maple?
INSPIRED  \(=*0*=)/
Haku is so adorable :-D  But- can you tell me please what every button on the "rice machine" says? And other stuff on it. I just love machines and it's weird feeling to not know about it's functions xD  Also- does it work with every type of rice? Seems pretty fun to make but I don't know if I have acces to the rice you have.  Best regards from Poland,  Greg
All the oil splattering around will drive me nuts..  But omg your aesthetic sense is amazing. I need that flower mold tray
Who just watches and never does this? And wishes they have a cat right now?
I LOVE CHOCOLATEEEEEEE AND POPCORN RICE THEY TASTE SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOD
In America we eat this for breakfast lmao. The cereal is called rice crispys
YAY POKI
Wow that was a master piece
I had that when I had one of the Tokyo treat things
what happened to you I wanna know
i just like your videos it makes me be happy 😃😃
Can we use different kinds of oil for that recipe? What else?
A work of art! I never knew you  can make puffed rice
💞🐱💞🐱
HOLY SHIT I DIDNT KNOW RICE COULD POP LIKE MARSHMALLOWS WHAT ELSE COULD
i subscribed a while ago but i forgot how relaxing, interesting, and beautifully shot your videos are, happy to have found them again!
A true food artist
Show me your face
In Indonesia puffed rice is call "rengginang"
😋😋
my cat really like to run and bump his head to a lot of things
Can you do a house tour?  Plz
Wonder Jun got any scissors in his house😂
If I were the cat, I'll open my mouth and finish that chocolate in one bite.
Your videos just have this comfy feel that I absolutely love.
surprised to see the thumbnail! finally Poki on your cooking vid!
TÜRKİYE +1 Hİ I AM TUSHISH BOY SA
Katitos!! Ty for sharing!
2:15 it is so satisfaying!
The place you live in looks so serene!
When I'm gloomy, I watch this video. The popping sound, great food, green scenary and creative Korean caption with cute onomatopedia ("풒오호우하오", "파파팦", "졸골골"...😃) makes me happy. Thank you for great video :]
Nice smooth opening drone shot..well done...!!!
Im not dissing but i wanna know why Jun always let’s the cats smell the food before he eats it. Does anyone know?? #2018
Haku the cutest cat ever
Beautiful cooking.  A work of Art.
I really want to learn Chinese its cool. But I love your channel keep it up 😇.
The cat is just like wtf bro.(on the melting chocolate part)
I suggest you put on your headphones, his voice and the crackling makes it so satisfying 😍😍
Wow!! It looks  delicious!! Your cats are so cute 🐱
I wish I could find a man like Jun 😍
nagi soo cute!!
Eating chocolate with chopsticks
I love how poki and the other cat licked their lips in unison 💕
Omg his knife though 😍😍I love the design on it!
พี่เป็นเชฟใช่มะงับ
hey... does this work with every kind of rice or only with special species?
Hi, I'm Croatian. I love your videos (and your cats😍)
came here from Julien Solomita's vlog. How do you have such adorable and well behaved kitties!? They are so precious.
You are who I aspire to be when it comes to small meals. Watching your whole Library right now. Beautifully edited too!
You make everything you cook look so beautiful. You're an amazing cook.
오오 쌀로만든 팝콘이라고 해서 들어와봤더니 그냥 작은 튀밥 이구만?
Cool ! I'm going to try that ! :)
For a second I thought he was going to try and eat the popcorn rice with the chopsticks then I was like oh yea spoons were invented.
Poki managed to stay calm and not to scream ! Did haku and nagi's chillness finally influenced him?
can cats eat puffed rice?
skips 20 sec ads on other channels, watches 3+min ad for JunsKitchen.
I never knew rice could be cooked this way 🙃
Your home so nice
日本人の方ですか？？
ここどこー？？
Idk why, but to me Hershey chocolate tastes like puke. Maybe it’s cuz I’m used to the chocolate here where I live?
Helli im vietnamese
It’s beautiful.
I’ve never seen chocolate bars unwrapped so gracefully
我对脱粒的机器很有兴趣！
Never thought id see the day where poki could be in one of your videos. today is a good day.
you use the knife like a ninja bro
😮 omg I never new rice popcorn existed .
I love how your cats only smell the food and not take a bite. 😊
I love trying new foods, and I definitely like these videos. You’re and awesome cook jun!  I am Hispanic and love my moms homemade Mexican dishes and I’ve been learning how to make them from her. I hope I marry someone, possibly from another country, who’s a good cook.
Don't you think it's a bit torturing making your cat know what foods smell like and maybe they really want to try it but then you just eat it at the end before they could?
Aren't you supposed to be at the ocean with luffy and your crew?
Never in my life have I seen a person eat chocolate with a chopstick
Seeing Poki in the kitchen is so stressful! Has he learned to calm down over time?
The part where you said "hey I'm back" to your cat when he was sleeping just melted me
It bỏng gạo
I like the intro
It's called rice krispies in English(I don't know how to spell it sorry)
すご ライスポップコーンなんて知らなかった！
Try it with milk 😋
아름다워
Nice cat😻
ポン菓子のようなものかな？と思ったけど違かった、、 稲のまま油に入れた時、お花が咲いたみたいでとっても綺麗.*･ﾟ
이 유튜버 왜 이제 알았지 ㅠㅠ 너무 멋있다
You're new intro is really nice
i think is poprice not popcorn rice
This is the first time I've seen poki watch you cook!
Rice krispies
Omg Poki, was it hard to film with him? Or its finally well behaved? poki is awesome.
ok, I am officially intrigued  by the rice cleaning machine :D
米orn
Can we use sun flower oil
お米って弾けるんだ 初めて知った
I didn’t know theres such thing as popcorn rice :0
or, you know, buy a packet of rice crispies
So is Poki learning a bit of patience now? r is it just when the food is not something he'd eat instantly?
to be honest, I watch these for my entertainment, not because I want to cook this
rice can pop?
There is a machine in the open to peel of the shell of the rice that’s pretty cool
Does it work with any rice?
Oh no a ricer instal a popcorn maker in his car :O
awesome
Lit just realised you made Rice Krispies (cereal in the UK)
This is the life I always wanted to live like but I don't live like this sadly who agrees
What doesnt go with chocolate lol
Why do you use the portable stove, don’t you have one on your counter?
Brooooooooooo., YOU Look Sooo Smart, Slim., Stylish and Sexy...BROOOOO...!
Milk chocolate? Heresy!
Just buy rice krispies xD
Oml that is beautiful
Do Japanese people purposely make Japan look so good in their videos to punk us weebs?
beautiful video
in india they make a sort of savory snack with puffed rice... it has roast peanuts, curry powder, lime, jalenpeno... its awesome
Well i think in my country rice is a plastic lol cuz is no puff when i cook it
คนไทยหรือเนี้ย
you eat chocolate with chopsticks? lul
Wow !!! Was that like a rice field? ( sorry, not perfect English)  That looks so cool!!! And the Video is awesome!!!
Is that a weed plant
I like the channel the show is great. The only thing that I do not understand. Is why does he use a hot plate to cook with instead of a normal stove?
Wow. I really love your videos the nice vibe and beautiful cats just make me fell all happy and warm inside . <3 :)
Can you do thsi with normal bought rice from a store?
I want one of those chocolate mold
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ진지하게 보다가 자막 보고 뿜었다ㅋㅋ
That seems delicious! Greetings from Argentina
Yummy!!
Korean: ㅗㅑ  English: hi
음식입니까 예술 작품입ㄴㅣ카...
Your mom is muslim 😍😍😍
poki!!!!!!
That’s so cool! I’m gonna try that sometime.
Even Poki is calm sometimes :P
Love your vid love your cats but most of all the food you're showing us thanka for sharing
I don't mean to ask a dumb question but im gonna: are there different types of rice? That rice didn't look like "rice" it was more circular rather than like a long cylinder
Ah the Meiji Black Chocolate!!! There's a Daiso that opened up where I live and it sells it there so I get it whenever I can <3 It's so good, I still have some next to me to eat
😱 it’s like popcorn!
Im surprised the cat didnt get cat-napped
I didn’t know you were married !
i know it sounds funny , but your videos radiate such peace and harmony , it's like meditation watching them
You are too amazing to be real. Thank you for all of the wonderful videos!
Could you make vegetarian ramen? I would love that  Love your videos :)
The OCD channel
I love your video. it reminds me of the "venneta house" in NHK World 😍
Nice  village where is it i will move to Japan but i want to live there
Oh my gosh wow Japan! I would love to get my rice like this someone take me to japan noooowww T_T
Good presentation as always
Gordon has got competition
What kind of rice do I use?
I always wondered why rice crispys were called that π_π. It's made of an actual type of rice
i bet rice krispy treats made this way would be really good too just add the marshmallows and butter
More videos on fish please????
Junさんの動画好きなんだけど毎回猫達に食材近づけては食べさせてないからなんか可哀想に思ってしまう (勿論食べたらいけないものもありますが)
It's so perfetley and i like choclate,great job😉
How are you so good at everything?!
I love poki
What was that machine where you put the rice? I didn’t get quite well what it didi to the rice
Oh, beautiful
I couldnt imagine how hard it is to clean up every mess after every video 😂😂
OMG I have to make this! Btw cats 4 life!!
What's the name of the music at the last part? Thanks!
So cute
Poki here? wow!!!
Wait you can melt chocolate THAT easily? I thought it was supposed to be on heat and you have to do it right or it burns but you just added boiled water into a bowl and that was it! That's so useful!
we have chocolate here in germany that is called nippon, finally i know what it is :)
His house looks so neat
Как же классно ты готовишь :) И голос очень приятный
Are you Japanese ?
It looked so real, i actually thought you were cutting up real Koi.  Amazingly its beautiful.
Your videos always make me happy(and hungry)!  I love how you have your cats in your videos :)
Every video on this channel is a work of art. Each one brings me so much joy!
the oil is very hot and when the rice pop. be careful with your cats ~

The music kind of sounds like dear theodosia from hamilton
You got that fresh rice that was grown by your uncle, Jun?  That was really interesting as I've never seen anything about how fresh rice is processed.  Your crispy rose chocolates were beautiful.  You're an artist, Jun!
can you please do yakisoba? <3 love your videos!
Jun If cats were appearing in the old videos, it is better to change to the thumbnail that cats are in.
Ur cat is sooooooo cute
Jun if your reading this I want to let you know that Im an american citizen who loves japanese food, Thanks to your channel and your recipes I can enjoy the food even more! My favorite recipe so far was the koi sushi (it tasted like heaven)

Hi, can you make "Sumire Kaarage Roll"? Thanks from Malaysia
Shokugeki no soma 101%
Stupendo!!!
In India, puffed rice is made with sand and no oil. Of course it's not always real sand, but crushed dried beans, it literally cooks in 10 seconds
best channel of all time
猫達に油が跳ねそうで怖いな……(＞人＜;) 家で作ってみたいけど昔油が跳ねて火傷してしばらく痛い思いしたことあるから恐怖心が(´；Д；`)

Hi Jun, what brand of Yanagiba do you use? I understand that you referred to an amazon one but I am curious what brand it is. Thank you!
I want more videos

That looks like it’s made for a dessert or breakfast. Not the chocolate though , you don’t have that for breakfast
My favorite Japanese food is Oyakodon. Jun Please make it.
Jun, between you and Rachel who cook more?
Normal cats would scratch the hell out of them if you hold or pet them for more than 5mins
What kind of rice is used here? :o And, which do you think is best and why?
In what part of Japan do you live?? It's beautiful!
4:17 cat changes colour! Amazing!
Hey Jun! I really enjoy watching your videos, the filming is so well done. I’m curious, what did that machine do to the rice in the beginning?
Dude could you make curry, l'd love to see your way of making it.

I love you Jun

你家的猫好漂亮！很喜欢。你做的爆米花也很棒。
Are you working as a chef in a restaurant?
hello rachel and jun, i appreciate your videos and love your cats😍 but may i know which part of japan do you live in? i may be going to japan this year during december...hopefully you reply asap....
why do you always make your cats sniff your food, I find it disgusting. Is it some kind of training?
Hey Jun, can you make a video on how to improve your knife work ( where to place a your finger when using a knife and so on) please!!
I know it sounds cliche to ask but what do you guys eat for breakfast?
I’ve tasted popcorn rice before and it was delicious 🍿

Omg thank you for uploading a new video, im always waiting for your new videos
한글자막 감사합니다
cat: I'm hungry
Here is a question for you guys; I can't eat onions, I am mildly allergic to them, but here in the US, most low quality foods use onion as a flavoring. How prevalent is onion in Japan, and Japanese food?
Hey can you make a video on Hakata Torimon? A friend brought these from Japan and  they were amazing. I had been looking everywhere for a recipe, but then I remembered you. :)
Jun you are absolutely amazing, every time I watch your channel I get so inspired, and I see the wonderful side of Japan and it's beauty thanks to you. You are my inspiration in an artist and as a future chef!! Ps. I love your cats!! ❤️😘😊

밥콘
your cat is adorable can i have him thank you
Whats that mechanic you used on the rice? I'm guessing it does more then just taking the husk off (based in the multiple options) but i just never seen anything like it and am curious what all it does.
I want to live in japan tbh 😧
What are those bowls you used to melt the chocolate?! I want! This recipe looks yummy and I will definitely try this! Your cats are so attentive and regal, it's great and really adds to your videos. Best wishes!
He makes anything look good
자막ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ파파팦ㅍ팦ㅍㅍㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I recently made the mistake of trying to polish the sides of my knife with a sharpening stone(2000/6000) and now theres cloudy smudges on it. How do i fix this? Any help is appreciated thank you!

Amazing. I really want to try it, looks fantastic!*-*
Presentation is just simple & wow
Those homemade flower shaped chocolates, instant pussy
isn't canola oil unhealthy?
Với 14 video, anh có 1m sub, thật đáng ngưỡng mộ
You should try frying things in coconut oil (the refined kind that has no taste) instead of canola oil! It's much healthier than canola oil, as canola oil becomes even more unhealthy when it breaks down while frying. My dad uses coconut oil to fry things all the time and it works exactly the same!
could you make a video teaching knife skills?  it would be fascinating
Please make more videos D:
Your channel is so relaxing. I love your cooking, videos, and your cats, especially Haku. You're definitely one if my all time favorite people to watch.
Poki is actually watching quietly! 0:
Aw so fun!! In the US, it is winter, and this is a great way to spend a chilly night without the regrets that come with store-bought popcorn! I can’t wait to try!! Thank you!! ☺️👌
People from japan are cool 😎

he loves his cat
Hey Jun!!! Try to make Oyakodon

Jun-san can you make a video for Japanese Fried Rice (Chahan) please? :Q would love to see how you make it your style
Damn, that's fresh as it gets
please to upload video ASAP
I’m glad I found this channel!Very entertaining I own a Black Cat myself, I raised him when he was a kitten and now he is nearly 4 years old. I trained him how to sit, roll over and fetch but the problem with fetch is that he chases it and carries it around rather than returning it to me. Any tips??
Does this works with any kinds of oil and any kinds of rice?
This is essentially rice crispier and a Rose shaped crunch bar and it looks like fucking art this channel is amazing
aaah what a nice video (*´∀｀*) maybe,,, you can try making oyakadon for a video ??  It would be nice if you did ヾ(*´∀｀*)ﾉ
I love how your cat goes with you.  Did he or she stay in that bag very long? They are so adorable. I have 2 cats myself. Cat owners are caring kind of people. I love popcorn and chocolate yum

YOU CAN POP RICE?! HOW HAVE I EVER KNOWN THIS WHAT THE HELL?!
Hi Jun, can you provide a link to your Amazon store? I like the rose silicon mold and would love to get one. Thanks!
Popped wild rice is very good also! My family is Native American from the Ojibwe tribe and it's a pretty big staple food of Native Americans. Very versatile and delicious, I recommend that you try it!😊
You from Janpan  But you can speak English . I can speak English too  I from Vietnam ^^
Upload more I love your vids
Esses gatos comem melhor do q eu credo ;-;
Make a haku cat cake please
I know a girl named Daisy Brown that really like your channel. I hope you know how much your helping her.
I'm a vet from Brazil, and I would love to see you giving natural food for your cats instead of dry ones. I no longer feed my dog with dry food and I wish my cats would eat natural food that i cook as well but they don't seem to like it... I think your cats would love the balanced, supplemented natural food that you could prepare for them :) hope you consult a vet to have a natural diet made for your cats and cook for them! The benefits are huge (and would be nice to see being brought up in your videos)
Adoro esse canal
are you Japanese or Chinese? 0w0
Do more videos of sharpening knives!!
The question is, how do you eat it?
Make the videos 10 minutes !
Cats, his clear voice, the way he handles his knives, and all those cooking sounds… Gosh, I'm in love with this channel. Every single thing's so perfect. Thanks, Jun. I guess I'll be able to handle my hospital life since I'm with your channel. Hope you know how much your videos helped me out soothing myself.
Hi, I'm italian. I love your videos (and your cats😍). I think that your videos are useful for learn many things about your culture.  I really appreciate the fact that there are subtitles in Italian! 🙏
Can I do this with American rice
Hi Jun, your kitchen is the cleanest I ever seen. Your furniture looks so clean, it's like you just got them from the store. Do you have any tips? Thanks for your amazing videos!
I love your channel sm you and your cats are amazing love from WV <3 <3
I just wanted to tell you that a Facebook page called Koisas de Bichos stole your video of your pet food vs homemade cat food( something like that) video and put it up on Facebook.
The damastic knife
All went well until I tried to separate the rice from the oil and I melted the colander... I’m going to be I trouble when my parents get home.
Cute
What cooking utensils do the Japanese use, and for what?
You have such cool cats
You should use the knife you polished
Why not make puffed rice the traditional way with out the oil?  IE put the rice with water in a steam pressure vessel.  Bring to pressure and quickly vent the pressure.
Adoro i tuoi gatti, sono troppo dolci :)
wow has jun ever considered taking a culinary school? or is it not that easy?

I wonder if Jun does this as a job (probably). I also wonder how long it took him in college/cooking school to get this far:3
6月の偉大なビデオは良い仕事を続ける
And that’s 630+ people who are jealous of the cats life or just crossed eyed and got the thumbs up button with the dislike one
This may be simple for you, but could you make a Benton box with onigiri and tamagoyaki and other foods?
고양아ㅠㅠㅠㅠ왤케얌전하니ㅠㅠ

Hey jun.. I've seen your previous videos.. it's all great videos, and I'm wondering where can i find a portable stove like yours.. what brand is it?
One of the biggest Japanese youtubers, always humble. The grain on the stalk is a GENIUS IDEA too.
น่ากินจังงง เเมวพี่อะน่ะ😂😂😂

I have a question what kind of knife is that because i need a new one
2:32
I love how you make sure your cats know what your eating before you eat it I absolutely adore your channel 😁👍
Could you make a video where you make a bento. I really LOVE seeing the making of a bento. They look sooooo satisfying. This would be AMAZING. Thank you.
Every time I see your cats looking so passionately at you I get this image of master splinter of teenage mutant ninja turtles.  Who knows maybe your cats will teach some other animals how to be ninja cooks?
Sorry but what happened to the other orange cat?
I like your chanel
Deep fry noodle wit some rice plea

2:50 THAT WAS SO SATISFYING
Who doesn’t like this guy
Here in America those looks like rice crispy treats, its a breakfast.
whoever marries you (if you are not married yet) will be the luckiest person in the world.
Make pizza
Add milk? Or marshmallows! 😀 Maybe a spoon isn't the best way to eat them since they're dry the spoon is likely to get stuck in your mouth?😥 But I haven't tried them so maybe dry is best...but then I'd eat them by hand...unless Jun eats popcorn with a spoon. 😉
How do you train your cat to stay in the basket when your going somewhere

Try Cooking with katana Challenge!
CRUNCH BARS!!!!!!!!
Your videos are so relaxing! I love them!
Japanese food, cute cat and Japan, your channel is one of the best!!!!
I really enjoy how you engage/involve your cats.  Some people say "cats are total jerks because, well.. that's just their nature." which is untrue not only for them, but for all pets. If you engage your pets, give them affection, and show them that they are part of your life, they will almost always react/behave accordingly.  For instance if you kick/yell at/isolate <insert_pet_here>, they will likely not react well to people. Alternatively, if you treat them as friends AKA engage them (pet them and talk to them) and also care for them (make ready their food and water), they will almost certainly love you and respect your (and their) surroundings.  Most of the time, the way a pet acts tends to be a reflection of yourself.  You get what you give :)
this looks so good, mostly cause i love chocolate
Make more homemade vs store videos or the food for your cats I love them as well as all your cooking videos I find them incredible
That's a beautiful knife you have. Also I will try the recipe for chocolate.🙂
Im gonna move to Japan and live a beautiful life like this guy one day
Do a how to make dorayaki pls

Is YouTube just a hobby for you? Because I just stumbled upon your channel and the content/production is incredible.
The video of u cycling makes this video so peaceful for me.
Can any kind of rice puff up like this?
What part of Japan do you live in because the scenery is amazing

YOU'RE A  LEGEND
I recently discovered your channel and bingewatched all your cooking videos  ❤ Its aesthetically pleasing and your skills are pretty good.. and of course your cats make everythin better ❤
sou br mas gosto de assistir ele
It looks good. Especially that chocolate
Why did u let your cat smell everything?
One of my classmates called this asian popcorn 😂😂😂
That's a quite common snack in Bangladesh. The rural areas it's like a daily snack. People here mostly incorporate this with spicy stuffs, which tastes pretty good actually. I personally prefer eating this with warm milk. Here it is known as "Khoi" we write it as "খই". It's commonly known as "parched rice" in english if I'm not wrong. there's also "Muri" i. e. "মুড়ি"  which is known as puffed rice. Most people tends to get confused between these two.  Btw, that looks tasty! Gotta try it with chocolate someday 😇
These videos really help my depressive/anxiety episodes. Much love to you, Rachel and your lovely cats💕
Came for the recipe, Stayed for the cats.
I'm asleep.
Jun can you cook japanes new years food ?  I often see in anime japan, its like bento and have much selection of food :)

Jun I'd like you to make a small kanji tutorial. I think it would be useful for people who are travelling to Japan so that they can read kanji and write it.
I love your videos so much. They have such a unique vibe to them, and it always boosts my mood watching these. You have truly sparked a fascination in me for Japanese culture and food. Keep up the great content.
Amo tus vídeos ♥️  Ya los acabo de ver a todos. Saludos de Argentina
Since you are into cooking, perhaps you've heard about Peaceful Cuisine? It's also a Japanese cooking channel on Youtube and I think he is a good cook too!
I feel like your cats really enjoy listening to the sounds of your cooking lol :)
Good cat
コンロ1つとってもカッコイイ、、！！ というかそのコンロ欲しい。(笑）
ファンです！何よりセンスがいいのがとても魅力的です。猫とイケメンに可愛い奥様💕  まだまだ、見たい♪  今回は、伯父さま登場！ 米でポップコーン！グルテンアレルギーには、たまらないです！
撮影風景が、私の住んでいるところに近いので、何か親近感が湧きました🎵
Tus videos me encantan!
Is there any other tricks your cat knows?
Wow something that I can actually potentially make!!
Why do you let the cats sniff everything? If it's to satisfy their curiosity before they get on the table to check themselves, then it is really smart. Should have tried the same with my ferrets a long time ago; those nosy fur-balls would get into so much trouble out of curiosity.
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run better run outrun my gun All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run better run faster than my bullet
*talking to the black and white cat*  WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO POKI! I can't believe he didn't try to eat it from the spoon XD
I will probably move alone soon and im so exited to have my own life and live peaceful moments like these. Cooking, going with the bike even tho ill buy a car, drawing and painting all day, even working and making money. oh gawd i want it so bad

ジュンさん、ラファエル絶対あなたのことぱくってますよ
Can you use any oil
I'm so glad I found your channel again, you not only make interesting foods but also have a home vibe to you.  If there was something I'd like to see, maybe a Japanese sweet or savoury? Then again something like Gyoza would be good too. (I couldn't remember how to spell Gyoza so I just did it from memory)

見るたび思います、包丁さばきが格好いい！
Japan is so beautiful, and I love how modernization and technology blend so well with the environment (the clean looking rice husking machine in a rural farm area?!). We only have imported rice but I'm now willing to try to cook your dish! Oh I wish I could deep fry a rice stalk, looks so nice! I turned to an excited girl from this video! This is a beautiful art work and I'm so glad to have stumbled upon it!
This is my new favorite channel on YouTube. Every single second is delightful!
Hello Jun! I would like to request you to teach us how to make uhh I'm not sure if this js how you spell it but I would likt it if yiu could teach us how to make pork katsu. I temember visiting Japan and I tried thag dish. I fell in love with it and I reallg want to know how to make it. Thank you!

What’s the machine u threw all the rice in before you came home? Did it cut the rice in half to make it smaller or cleaned them?
Howdy from Texas.. =^. .^=
I think this is the lowest like to dislike ratio in a video ever
I wish I could try these recipes :( my dream in life is to become a chef!
Hey juns i know what poki is, i have read a book about cat and your cat poki is nonpedigree
In my country, they put caremel, you can try it. So yummy.

Hey, Jun I enjoyed your video but I was wondering how is there no snow anywhere where you at where you got the rice to make Popcorn Rice from the rice field?
Is that Poki? I thought he would still eat so much and is he the one who meows so much? And went to the garbage? xD I don't remember
18 videos and have 1million subs like tf... after all he is amazing
You have gotten a new subscriber👍
What was the machine you used at the beginning? Was it a rice washer of some sort?
upload more !!!!
Hi, I love your videos :) This may be a long shot, but can you tell me the model of your gas stove? I try to find one since my kitchen is tiny, but I can't find anything but camping gas stoves.
your cats know English and when you speak Japanese do they still understand you?
Dude I love your cats. They add personality to your videos it's great.
Poki is finally behaving himself, i see
Mr jun i suggest make something Indonesian food because recently i've seen a video you've visited indonesia before the simple food is Fried Rice
Wooo es increibleeeeee
😍
Oh, a Zwilling knife. i appreciate that as a German
this guy literally use his cats for clickbait lol
In Japan, instead of saying I love you, they say "Tamanegi wa ori budesu" which mean "I give all my heart to you" and I think that's beautiful
한국이았다
did you have girlfriend? she is so lucky😂😂
I wonder what anime Jun likes
Everything about this video was so satisfying to watch
The art of culinary beautiful
Wish I was home to show my mom this video. She loves the kitties~
can you do one episode for takoyaki??
I love this channel. you rarely up load but even after years of being subscribed i always come back to watch videos
What brand of knives do you use? Specifically the demascus ones?

Loved Poki's kitchen debut :DD
My cats would eat it -.- My one cat star will literally eat anything you give her. It's always fun when you give her sour foods.
Nhật bản đẹp vl
Why the hate dislikes !?!...
Can do a pop rice with an olive oil?
I mean, I did come for the cats, but I for sure decided to stay for the food!  Your amazing cooking made me, a devoted vegetarian (and almost vegan) for almost 5 years, crave that homemade Ramen or Tempura Udon! It just looks too damn delicious! (I am gonna stick with veggies though, as tempting as it is :D)
Do i can use Nuttella instead the Choclate bar?
O my gosh, that looks like fun to make 😊  And Poki is in the video, yay 😸
いちいちオシャレ…
น่ารัก ●○●
Wow, Poki was being good in the kitchen!! It's a miracle!
and I m late again
How many kawaii cats you got!!! Im jealous
Poki is finally in your cooking video
Do you have a pork loin?
한국어 자막은 누가 다는걸까요..

Can you plssssss make dumplings?????????????????
THIS IS SO LUXURY
I enjoy this channel soooooo much more than the one with rachel
I'd like to see you make Sukiyaki
Omg so cute letting your cats sniff out that chocolate before unwrapping it! I totally do the same thing with my dog. They experience the world so much through scent, so it's like keeping her up to date on whatever's happening. 😂
Hi
お米はなんでも良いのかな？
I swear, this comment section is the best in all of YouTube. Just good vibes
I have medium grain rice in my cabinet, would that work for this? Do I need to wash it and let it dry before frying? What's the process?
moarr poki pidio.. .😠
Your videos make me feel safe and happy. If a genie gave me three wishes. It would be to make my mother a millionaire,  to save the ocean from mankind, and to be juns and rachels 4th cat. Good luck in all your endeavors.
I want that knife so bad! Great video Jun! Keep up the good work!
Omg I am shook DIY crunch bars
You should deft upload more often and show more natural foods and cookings of Japan
Wow wee
I want him and Gordon Ramsay to meet. I want to see if they approve each other's cooking skills
When the cats sniffed the chocolate my heart stopped pounding
Is Japanese chocolate different to American chocolate as far as taste goes?
Cute cats 😄😄😄👍👍👍
you're very good at what you do Jun! love the channel, cats and all! keep the videos coming
It's always such a joy to watch your videos Jun. They put a smile on me even in darker times. Bless you!
Puffed rice has been a savory breakfast item in India for centuries. The puffed rice used there are more puffier than rice crisps shown here, and they are yummy AF. They call them Kurmuras or Mamaras, depending on the region.
Who uses chopsticks for a truffle...
It’s nice to see Poki is behaving well enough to watch the cooking now! They are all such cool cats. ^^
If Jun opened an actual restaurant it would be #1 on my list of places to visit in Japan.
Omg this was so calming to watch!
Hahaha... I don't know why you made it so complected!? It says "Khoi" in Bangladesh. And it doesn't require any oil or the machine thing!
In my country we eat popcorn rice glued with each other with honey. They are shaped like pine cone and have size like quite big fist.
Poki? Wat
Why does the cat not run away
4:10  Cat 🐈 = is he going to let me eat this good smelling food? Cat 🐈 2= ya maybe! That’s awesome  Cat 🐈 = You are the nicest one! Cat 🐈 2 = yeah... never mind ;-; savage :(
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!
Oh thank you! It looks easy to make. Another variety goes into my daily snack menu xD
Man, i must said u good at everything, i bet ur partner will feel like she have a best guy, btw, is that japanese lifestyle?, i loved  that, it so relaxing. I think i have moved to japan
上からチョコがくると埋葬されてるみたい
Other than your knife, recipe and well video, my eyes rolling into your cats :)
I love your videos. They are so beautifully made and relaxing, even though I don't cook. But this one, I will try!!
Omg I’m always excited when you post a new video
아ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ한국어자막 의성어 개웃기네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I want you to make curry rice
I want you to make bento
In Indonesia we called it rengginang
I am never see that, that is a poprice and i live in  Viet Nam
Mr can you cook every week and i request chicken katsu kari
Your videos are always so calming and aesthetic, I watch them when I'm feeling down, and they make me feel a bit better. :) thank you
As always, the kitties are so well trained. I was so sure that they would be startled when the rice pop and flew toward them, instead they remained chill about it.
Jun is a master cook
It's nice to see Poki getting in on the action. I love your cats!

Omg you have 1M congratulations:)))
I really enjoy that you have subtitles. It’s great when I’m hoh

Subscribed☺ this channel is enterteining and fun to watch your cooking skills are amazing by the way😊

so beautiful))
jun your videos are so aesthetic please upload more if you can keep good work
Kitty wants some pop rice!
A really inspiring Recipe, Valentine's day is safe. I don't know what kind of chocolate you use. But take a pinch of salt, in the molten chocolate makes the taste round. (Sorry, I translate this from German to English. And I don't know how to describe it better.)
Прелесть.. С меня лайк..)
If you have ever had a crunch bar this is kinda what they taste like. My family make this stuff all the time
Why do u let ur cat sniff it?
i love your cats
i love your cats
i love your cats
Wow! Finally  Poki can stay calm while you cook.
おとなしいポキ🐱💕
What’s that machine that husked the rice? Is it a public machine or was it your uncle’s? So cool
Jun, can you teach us how to make chawamushi. That shit was too damn good I missed eating it since my local Japanese restaurant already moved somewhere far away😢😢😢😢 JUN PLEASE BRING BACK MY CHILDHOOD HUAAAAAA
駄菓子のニンジンとか 麦チョコみたいなやつなのかな？
You have the best life ever I'm jealous
I love puffed rice cereal. The UK has one called Sugar Puffs.
This channel deserves 10m subs. I mean even by the number of views it gets within days of uploading. I don't think Zoella gets this number of views in the same amount of time, and she has 12m subs.
Do you ever get cut when chopping?
are you asian i am form taiwan i am your fans
I love Meijii chocolet❤️❤️❤️
대박! i wish my cat are like yours, they are so behave TT
落ちつく🤗
I wish I could get fresh rice and process it myself— so cool. Truly farm to table.
Rachel is so lucky to have u <3
so its rice krispies
I love how poki was so calm even tho some popcorn was popping out of the pot and hitting him

What did the machine at​ the beginning of the video do to the rice?
Why name the clip is THAI ????
This is the single most wholesome channel on my subscription list
Hello I'm your new subscriber now I subscribed you nice video btw
I live for Jun's cooking videos. He needs to upload more often 😭
Hey Jun, what portable stove do you use?
Here in Indonesia we have similar thing, but usually for home purpose, we use left-over cooked rice (that still good, of course) to make sure no food is wasted. We dry those rice under sun for 2-4 days (depends on the weather) and after it dries, we fry it just like you do. It can be eaten plain, or with some salt or sugar for seasoning. For business product purpose, I think it's inappropriate to use left-over, so maybe they use fresh rice and dry it under sun. It's kinda weird, you cook rice and then dry it under sun, and then fry it to make this food. But the benefit of cook-first-then-dry-and-fry is you can shape it when it's still soft, like, a round shape, it may be big or small to be a light snack while watching tv. We may use common rice found in market or sticky rice---which tastes better---and called it as "Rengginang".
猫可愛いなぁ！
in my country, it's called REGINANG
*Julien* tornado kitchen VS  *Jun* Tidiest kitchen please
It called "Trengginang" in my country 😊 my aunt always make it for me
WHAT CAMERA DO YOU USE??
What was happening when you put the rice into that machine?
I have a butcher knife and i can drop it on my hand and it wont cut....... I have to slam the knife and saw (up and down motion) to cut lettuce
That looks really good
V": oh baia miren al hombre que nunca tendre
Looks so good  😍
YOUR VIDEOS ARE AMAZING!  YOU SHOULD MAKE MORE.... LOVE THE CATS.😄
Craft-Rice Krispies
You should make a miniature cat cafe (sort of like a doll house) *BUT* (here's the twist) the food is meant for the cats not humans and the cats can eat everything there!
The cats make the video better 1000000000000000000000%      I bet you didn’t even try to read the number. You just skipped over all the zeros
How much canola oil do you need?
Do you have a recipe for homemade 雷おこし??  I had some about 12 years ago when I visited 浅草 and I would love to make some of my own!
Japanese rice is definitely one of the best rice in the world. Unfortunately it is so expensive buying overseas....
Tried making this. Melted my thermometer and burned the rice.
好棒、还有中文翻译
ん？日本でいう、ポン菓子みたいなものですか？
From what I can tell, Jun has the perfect life. Cycling around with his cat in a basket, cooking casually for over million subs..."what's that? his partner is a cute redhead as well?" ok well that settles it.
watching your cats made my day better
Your videos are awesome
I find Japanese 7/11 really interesting. You should buy some convenience food there and make it something spectacular!
oh my god that cat is beautiful
You should make Japanese curry your way
U just made crunch bars -.-
ポン菓子懐かしい😍
Nice but I kinda think it’s mean to make your cats smell your food and if you won’t or can’t give them some. Lol, the look on their faces after they’ve taken a whiff of it...
とても素晴らしい動画です。
until next year
稲穂のまま揚げるとあんなにお洒落になるのか
Does anyone know what portable stove he uses :o?
盛り付けおしゃれでおいしそぉ～
Jun make draw my life please
Your cats a so well-behaved, you live in a place that looks straight out of a movie, and your cooking is great! Upload more please!
u are the best
What was the first thing that happened when he put the rice through that device and it came out all white? ? ? 😯😦😦
Damn you Jun, your videos are getting even better while my cooking skills have long been stagnated :P You're my hero <3
Idk why but I feel insanely claustrophobic while watching you work in your kitchen
정말로놀랍네..
You are literally greatness ,you are elegant and you should keep it up
Just here for th cats!
Finally you made a new vid. I was waiting for a million years
one does not simply eat a bowl of rice crispies without any milk
Super simple pizza recipe with just 3 ingredients! 1. A phone 2. Number for Pizza Hut 3. Money
I love how he always have his cats in the background!
Show more vids of your cats
Wow it’s awesome
i love your videos :3
Omg I never knew Rice Krispies are actually made from rice!!!
I love it how poki is now allowed to sit and watch jun cook
you should do a tour around the city and the beautiful lakes :3
I wonder if you can make Jun's special romantic dinner, and eat together with Rachel in the end?
oh shit, juns kitchen gotta drone! D8  woah i never thought of using rice for 'popcorn' =o i recently had some sweet n salty senbei wafer things and loved them, now id LOVE to try making some with this poprice idea =D  PS, your uncle has the prettiest, best-maintained crop space and equipment ive ever seen. <3
Jun, how do you strain it? On paper towels,  or other strainer?   Also I noticed you used short grain rice.  Is there a difference?
That is SO cool!
Thanks for sharing, I really enjoy your videos!
I'd love a salmon-rice-pan thing from you :D
See you next year~
Who the fuck dislikes this
Your life is so beautiful, unfortunately, here where I live, I can never have a life like this :(
PLEASE MAKE WAGASHI! 🌸🍃
poki made it finally..such a goodboy
since theyre deep fried, do they suck up a lot of the oil and retain it? id love to make these but i dont wanna jump my cholesterol more than i already have lol
Those cats are too cuuutteeee😻😻😻 Ya just got a new subscriber bro😆
What kind of stove do you use Jun?
i think watching you all these years and getting to know the ingredients so well Haku will become an excellent chef in his next life.
I never knew that a rice pops too
Greetings from Detroit.
Love the outdoor footage. It's so pretty. You make puffed rice look so elegant. That would be great for a lovey movie night with your honey.
Can you make a video about how to Sharp a knife
*mrw you come for the cooking but you spend the whole video watching the cat*
I love that Poki has finally calmed down around food to be able to appear in your videos!!
So smooth!More vid pls
Hi Jun, Do you use drone camera for your video? If so, what camera do you use? I like your skyline videos. :)
I’m here from j&j’s kitchen and now I’m addicted. These videos are so pleasing
*Welcome to the rice fields!*
Jenna Marbles mentioned you in her video!!! It's called cooking show for my dogs. Check it out:D
Grande, orgoglio italiano
Is Poki finally trained? X'D He looks so well behaved here lol.
Is it ok to use what ever rice i have ?
such a nice owner! i do the same to my cat when they see me cooking or eating. lol
日本ではお祭り屋台の定番、ポン菓子🙋があります。大砲みたいな真空管の中で、蒸気で、熱せられることで、お米の水分が抜けます。その時の弾ける音が、ポン、ポン、と聴こえるからポン菓子といいます。そのまま、食べたり、水飴と絡めたりして売られています。なかなか実演するところが、減ってきていますが、みかけたら、是非、外国の方にもみて欲しいです！

Hey Jun, can you make a video making Japanese curry with beef or pork tonkatsu? I went to Japan recently and the one thing I badly miss was Japanese curry with the tonkatsu.
Me encantan tus videos
猫めちゃかわ
It is so tasty I cooked it tho and ate it
It seems like Japanese people are very practical in all regards, they have something for everything
Chocolate are poison for cat
You should start a restaurant. I will fly there no matter how much a ticket will cost me.
Just buy rice bubbles..... wtf
This video is so beautiful I started tearing up.
Been three days and it’s still trending :D
お洒落〜!!
細部の盛り付けにいつも感心してしまいます(^^)しかも絶対美味しいやつ！うちも田んぼがありお米作ってますが、来年はこれをマネしたいです！
You sir are an artist. Envious beyond belief
this is what anime would look like in real life.
항상 느릿느릿한 느낌이지만 그게 아주 좋아요. 마음에 조금씩 가득 차는 느낌이랄까요. 처음엔 아주 녹슨 칼을 깨끗하게 만드는 영상을 보고 구독하기 시작했는데, 아주 신기한 음식과 조리 과정에 더 눈이 가네요. 요리하는 과정을 구경하듯 앉아있는 고양이들도 귀엽구요ㅎㅎ.. 팝콘은 옥수수로 만드는게 일반적인 요리잖아요. 근데 쌀로 만든다고 해서 눈 여겨 봤습니다. 좋은 영상이었어요. 맛있고 재밌는 영상 더 많이 찍어주세요!
이거보고 따라했는데 망한 1인
Your cats are so cuteee!!!!!😍😍😍😻😻😻
오늘도 힐링하고 가요.😆😀😀
So I put the chocolate in the freezer?
米が弾けずに焦げました笑
멋져요!!
So nice videos! Keep going!!
The best graphic quality you've uploaded ever. Always love to see the way you used your camera, great.
In other words, rice krispies
it should be called rice popcorn tho, not popcorn rice.
You are a professional chef.you should open cafe and place all your neko there
How do your cats NOT eat everything you let them sniff?!
I was just looking at that Kramer Zwilling online. How do you like it?
The puffed rice looks good.  Would it go well with a sweet bean paste rolled in it in a little Dognut hole?
THIS IS SO COOL WHAT I NEVER KNEW ABOUT THIS
A video called "Popcorn Rice" on trending... What has YouTube become?
Please god, send me a cutie cat like that for the rest of my life :(
Jun is always trending on YouTube i love his innovative cooking ideas
this video was so calming. 😺
Yum. Thank you for vlogging.
Haku: *intense looking*
Hi ryce
Did this nigga really just open a fucken chocolate wrapper with a knife?
TRENDING!
That is so cool! Although I have to ask, would any kind of rice work, or does it have to be a particular one?
A video with Poke! The presentation is amazing.
I love your channel so much! You've inspired my husband and I to try new things in the kitchen and to have fun cooking!

Your cat has a hitler stash 😂

CHOCOLATE IS POISONOUS TO YOUR CATS PLEASE DON'T FEED CHOCOLATE TO YOUR CATS PLEASSSSSSSE😫

Those fried rice plants tho.   Also nice recipe and tutorial! Looks like a nice dessert, appetizer, or even lunch!
Aaaah! I wish you’ll make more videos very often or longer 😩🙏🏼😢
Loved the intro of this video .. and how the Rice 🍚 will taste like .????, love watching from my village
Rice is good
Having cats sit next to an open pot of boiling oil. Seems smart
癒された(*´ω｀*)
This nigga life must be amazing be riding bikes with his cats and shit.
I REQUIRE A "LOVE" BUTTON
Can this be done with US commercial store rice and hot air popper?  Is there enough water content?
Gorgeous cats 😍
Your videos are literally my favorite on YouTube. Your editing skills are on point! I wish you would upload more often.
The cats approved
It Trending!!
So basically you made your own Rice Krispy cereal
I like how there is a machine you can polish your own rice, even choosing to polish so much of it.  So that's one way to make puffed rice, even making blossoms out of the stalk! There probably the baked, or maybe the air puffed, version of it. Unless I can make it with reduced oil, like how I make popcorn.  And what a ingenious way to make a double broiler! The water may be an issue, but I'm glad I don't have to spend a lot of money for it. I'll just use my head and make one for cheap! XD
I love all your videos!☺️
oohhh so like crunch bars
Why it isn't snowing in japan
Best homemade snow https://youtu.be/lHHrqdBKsA4
Love your cats
That town is so pretty
My first time watching the making of puff rice
I know half of you come here because of their cats
rice
That’s very dangerous to have your cats close to the hot oil dont you think?
Beautiful intro 🙏
I want to be one of those cats. They look like they live the life.
I love how the cats just watch him cook
Also, pray that the cats don’t decide to be curious
Почему это в тренде у американцев, а не у русских??
Exactly what is that sorting machine doing as I can't read Japanese
Try eating pop rice like cereal
So that's how they make Crunch chocolate bars
AHH ITS POKI
*Jun puts a tiny bit of oil into the pan*  Cuts to pan full of oil
POKIIIII
What a peaceful life he has...!
BACK AT IT AGAIN JUN WITH THE TOO-HIGH-QUALITY-FOR-YOUTUBE VIDEOS
Gordon Ramsay My A$$
I didn't even know rice could do that... Amazing!
I only clicked on this video because of the cats in the thumbnail.
Jun is wonderful
Don't make 4K video if it is to compress it like this !
Hello, Jun! I noticed your 'Omurice' video was used/stolen in this video by Curvey!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=814gP_yHcAg ( Go to 29:16) I am not too educated on the laws regarding fair use but this seems unfair to me! Lookin out for ya buddy ;) Edit : Also I see that it is such a small portion of his video but I figured I might as well notify you just for the heck of it
U made me smile :)
Hey poki is finally in the video's. Got him to stop being a brat? lol
It’s good to know that someone has a lot of money.
u just can't find such quality's rice on the market...........
HE UPLOADED     AND POKI WAS IN THE THUMBNAIL
27th trending!!
Chocolate is lethally poisonous for cats and dogs (google search will show you), so, good job making a viral video that shows off how you're poisoning your cats.
Those cats are adorable
Whoa, using a knife to open a candy bar? I never thought of that.
I am very happy to see Poki up there with the other two.
Anime irl. This is so mesmerizing and calming!
Love seeing rice being popped while still on its stalk.  Neat presentation!  My only objection was you were frying with your cats near by.  :(
Watching this channel I picked up a habit of letting the cat sniff the food before serving them.
Your videos are art. Everything about this video is so peaceful and beautiful. I was in Japan for a month and I thought it was one of the most peaceful and kind countries I've been in.
I really like your videos and your cats, but please don't bite the chocolate after they sniffed it. Cats they normally lick their ASS..
IT ACTUALLY EXISTS?!?!
pocky! <3
NVclosetmedgrower🏆🏆🏆🏆
Me encanta la receta, me encantan los gatos, me encanta la forma que tienes de editar los vídeos y me encanta este canal :)

Jun, I love seeing more of your aunt and uncle!!! More of them and how they live life  please! It’s wonderful.
It is a travesty that I'm not subscribed to Jun's kitchen yet. Let me fix that:)
That Bob Kramer knife is freaking beautiful
Looks fantastic.
im here for the kitties
I love how you let your cats smells everthing 😂
Is this how rice krispies are made?
That Kramer knife is gorgeous!!!
Why so much oil
As Korean, pop corn rice is very familiar snack to me. But your beautiful video and display made it really special. I admire your great work.
Rengginang?
These look Ikue a good ice cream topper also
Poki wanted some rice!
おいしそう。。ですが、揚げ物中に猫が近くにいるのは危なそう。。行儀の良い猫ちゃんみたいなので、手を出したりはしなさそうですが、 近くにいるから思いっきり油が跳ねてて心配すぎます。。
That damascus steel knife is beautiful.

Oh wow! Poki looks very calm in this. All of your cats look so sweet watching their papa cook. : 3I never knew how easy it was to make fancy chocolates. I’ll have to look for a nice mold and try this myself. Thank you so much for your easy to follow guides. : D
Does this recipe work for people who don't have cats, or?
こんにちは。 僕わ日本人で、ドイツの学校へ通っています。だから英語をわかります。ドイツでもビデオを見ています。英語がとてもじょずですね。
<not a hate comment>How to get to trending: make rice!</not a hate comment>
Watching the chocolate rose was so pleasing and satisfying for my soul. It was a very pleasant surprise. Everything Jun does is so aesthetically pleasing.
Japan have alot of creative people.
Is it just me, or does anyone else find this video super soothing????😊😚😁
That's cool, I never knew how to make puffed rice. Great video Jun ^-^.
kohaku is very obedient to stay in the carrier like that!

Wait, you let your cat smell your food before you eat it? I thought I was the only one
rengginang 😂
You're the main character of an anime
This looks so good. I've tried to do some things from this channel. Always failed. And your cats are so well behaved. I recently got a new kitty, I found him in the streets near ny house. Anyway, he is climbing everything. I know cats do that, but I can't seem to be able to train him.
Your cats are soooo cute!
Damascus 😮
I had no idea you could pop rice like pop corn. I wanna try this!
Its literally deep fried rice.
What brand of counter top gas burner is that??
Puffed Rice... loved the SHOT FROM GUNS commercials back in the 50's.
Chinese has this too, its called 米香 (mi xiang or bi phang in southern Min language), often combined with sweet syrup to make into biscuits :D
Can you make japanese curry?
I wana be the cat.
What does puff rice taest like I just want to know I want try making that 😄👍
Is that just a general communal use rice de-husking machine?
Ok next teach us how to make valentines choclet ;)
Whoa!!! You’re in trending!!!
Imagine the cats eat that chocolate popcorn......
I like how you use wild rice stem to serve it.
Congrats on trending!!
How come you let the cats sniff the chocolate?
そういえば僕も昔稲刈りの手伝いとかしてましたねー…稲刈り機？重機が壊れてしまい今は出来なくなってしまいましたが…今思うともっとやっとけば良かったなと😢

How to make a very good content 1.Do some random stuff 2.CATS 3.MORE CATSSSSSS
Lovely channel,lovely cats! I also am a lover of ginger and tuxedo cats and have a wonderful collection which also includes some very loving 24 toed Russian Blues! I live at the city limits and since people have seen cats in my driveway,I seem to have become the smalltown "cat rescue"! There is no greater personal bond than with a cat! ( And with crispy chocolate!)
poprice?
너무 귀여워요ㅎㅎ 항상 영상 기다리고 있습니다~
Try deep frying vermicelli noodles, it's like popcorn but without any fear of not popped corn kernels
Ok, something I can make. I already buy that chocolate so just need a cute mold. Daiso trip in my near future.
Awwww, look at Poki being a good boy!  Also your presentation is excellent as always, wow
Found the ricefields @filthyfrank
Who else is scrolling though the comments while watching this? ✔️comment & let me know📍
BORONDONG in Bahasa Indonesia 😂
I don't even cook and yet I find this entertaining
I kove how you make every thing into a piece of art! Also, what was that rice cleaning(?) thing？？
it seems the cats really want to try some
literally only watching this to see the cats
this is one of my fav channels on youtube..everything's soo clean here like a world without any kinda mess around
Puffed rice is a traditional snack in the Indian sobecontinent. In Bengali, we call in Muri and here in India it is usually mixed with lots of seasonings, raw vegetables and mustard oil to make a savory crunchy salad-esque dish.
Where can I get the device (portable stove) you used to cook the rice. That's cool
it's wonderful😮👍🏼
I just can imagine eating it mixed with chocolate, ohh damn looks like i must put my diet on hold
Can we only use short grain rice? Or will any kind of rice work?
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥..love you...and japan♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
あなたは本当にレストランを開く必要があります！
Everything you do is just fabulous
Isn’t this just rice crispys
Anyone else thought @RiceGum?
Hello!  Can you tell me how many square feet of land is required to produce about 10kg of rice and how long it takes to grow before it's ready for harvest?
wow congratulations this video is #7 on trending that's amazing and well deserved your videos are amazing and I can tell you put a lot of work into them.
So relaxing
I need to find me a husbando like Jun.
What was that machine you put the rice in to?
Poprice
I'm watching your cats. so well-behaved! and the one who rides in your basket. No fear! Oh, the popcorn rice smells delicious
Like for haku and poki :v
Jun you're on trending!!!
นึกว่ากังฟูกับเส้าหลิน
I just LOVE how eveything single one of your videos has millions of views, but you remain so humble about it! <3
I've missed seeing the kitties.  😍😘
Can I use any type of rice or just the  fresh  rice ? Cause we don't have rice in our country just  bought it  from other countries . So  we  have short grains rice but not fresh so can I use it?
Hey Jun, why do you upload videos every 2.months? :c
I wonder if my girlfriend will appreciate this.
Stop making me hungry
Very nice video
This gives a whole new meaning to "fried rice" haha! And I never knew they had self-serve machines that de-husk the raw rice you dump in. Mine always come preprocessed in a bag lol
Sugee! Is that machine for cleaning rice? Can anyone use it or it's your uncle's one? Wonderful video, most of all the beginning, I love videos with japanese countryside!
Japan is ....beautiful😍😍
Cannot stop looking at Haku 😂😂❤️
O.M.G the pop rice on the stalk is tooooooooooooo pretty.......................
How did you get poki to sit patiently
Gordon Ramsay who ?
What was the machine he poured the rice into? To remove the husks? If so, is that a commonly accessible machine for certain regions?
Your cat was under heavy fire there
His next video will be preparing and eating his cat
Nice video. Vizit to my channel please, friends
WOAH YOU GUYS GOT A DRONE?!?!?!?! Love your videos! Great as usual!!! :D
i wonder if he still eats it if his cats dont approve

Wow, I didn't know you could do that with rice.  Great quality video!  Thanks
In America we make rice crispy treats, it is a sweet treat made out of puffed rice, marshmallows, and butter all melted together, it is VERY sticky but delicious, and also we have puffed rice in a cereal box called Rice crispy's, that's what we call puffed rice in America
What ep of food wars is this???
i'm going to make puffed rice chocolates for the holidays!! perfect little recipe that should impress my family hehe~
Poki is quiet in this vid!! 😂
Your videos are so relaxing to watch 👍🏻

I have this bad habit of watching cooking tutorials but I never make what they’re cooking🤔
I love your cats
YouTube is nothing but cat videos.
it's called race cakes
POKI !!!!
This is cute
My family is very impressed :) also i didnt know you can do that
Oh cool, Poki is finally ok with watching you cook without "helping"! :D
Jun= king of presentation
Can you use any kind of rice or does it have to be a specific one?
What type of rice did you use Jun?
Wow that’s literally rice crispies
Pokki is finally in the video!!!!
back at my village when my grandma used to make it, we used leftover rice to make this pop rice. we dried the left over rice under the sun until it dries like the grain rice before we cook, and when it really dried we deep fried it . it turns like this.
How has your life not been put into manga yet?
came for the cat, stayed for the food
Jun, Do me a favor and never die...please
Junskitchen the visuals and audio in these videos r so pleasant and relaxing, keep up the good work!

It's my first time to see Poki chillin' on his seat while watching the food 😊😆
Does this work with rice from wal mart  cause I'm too lazy to get the rice myself.
I love your cats and you. Im ur new subcriber

i know you love your cats and treat them very well, but i would not let them so near a bowl of scalding hot oil on a burner like that. thanks for your great videos, though - i always look forward to the next one!
I compliment how beautiful and clean the area is, as I am sad that the citizens in my region are not considerate of caring for the land.
Wow this video just calmed all nerves I’m just so amazing gonna watch all your videos now

あんなかっこいいチョコの開け方初めて見た😧
Wait, is Poki actually not ruining everything in a *cooking* video?!?
my love for haku will never die!
it's been a while since you uploaded, but I can see that it was well worth it. Production took a leap forward
he does the same thing I do where the kitties get to smell whatever I'm eating/holding even if they can't have any <3
I love your kitchen. I can feel a positive energy;))
hmm i wonder if you could somehow bake it instead of frying it
Rice krispies
anyone know a website or store where to get damascus steel knifes straight from japan
your videos are super calming.
Asqueroso es anti higienico peimero le da a oler a los gatos y luego se lo come..yyyhhh
Every time I watch one of your videos I end up marathoning all of them 😂
Meow I love your cats. I have a cat his name is Jasper. he's always super curious of what I'm making like your cats :) He's a light gray cat with a white tummy. I love your videos can't wait for the next one tooooo!! <3
So happy another video

TRENDING
POKI
Jun is like the perfect husband, just saying....
I like when your cats smell stuff
I love how he gets so many more views than clickbait youtubers because we all know that his content is going to be good, not because we are baited by a misleading title.
clicked for the kitties
I'm sure I know this butbi hate to see the cats go so chocolate is highly lethal to cats
Your videos are so aesthetic, I love it❤
Kinkchiwa*
I love you channel
Your videos are so calming I love watching them
This is so wholesome
COMGRADS ON TRENDING!!!
Never knew rice popcorn was a thing:O
Beautiful knife!
You deserve 7.5 billion subscribers
One day when I'm not afraid of burning the house down....  I will  make every dish you showed us.
How the fuck do your cats stay that calm while ur doing work? My cats would eat the chocolate and suicide
Wholesome
Why do I feel like I'm watching cat porn
the way you opened that chocolate on 2:52 that’s amazing i’m truly impressed
I want some rice crispys now
Welcome to the rice fields ......
#7 ON TRENDING!! AND IT DESERVES IT!!
ah- y'know-  something to make for a dessert if you're up to it- maybe manju! well bean cake in American.
New subscriber here.  Your kitchen assistants are adorable.
Congrats being on #7 on trending!! ҉*\(`•ω•´)/*҉
Your Videos are always such a delight and extremely beautiful!  Amazing work ♥
日本人のコメントはポン菓子かどうかの指摘と猫に油飛ぶかの指摘ばかりですね
Cool!
I’m ok with videos like these trending
ok, youtube. i watched it.
Only Jun can make rice puffs look aesthetic. Looks fun, I’ll try making it and make rice crispy but healthier... 🤔
Weebs go crazy for this shit
Your videos are so good!
I love your videos.  <3
Juk?
I'm guessing you can only use short grain rice.
Have some rice with your chocolate
your videos are so relaxed I LIKE IT! :D
Pokey is in a video!!! Good job Pokey!!!!
You should make a dish that is typically made in America, just to see the cats react.
All of the effort you put into your videos.. wow just wow! Thank you so much for this
that's a beautiful Japanese knife
There's amazing channels like this getting 1 mil subs, and then you get Jake Paul that gets 10x that... what the fuck is YouTube now
Juns can you create Miso Shiru ?
Trending again! In America... Congrats!
That is some high quality rice right there. Japan is the best
OMG who disliked this? C’mon! It’s Jun!.... I dislike the people who disliked this  Jun, now I’m dying to try that!
Beautiful video Jun! The rice stalk looks so elegant and romantic on that plate!! Wow!!
WHERE CAN I FIN THAT RICE CLEANER!!! MY ASIAN ASSS NEEDS IT!!!!
4:20 Seems Poki can control himself in front of your cooking after all!
Hooray for Poki! He was a good boi and got featured~!
SICK KNIFE!!
You should have your own cafe     The cat cafe
I love and appreciate peaceful videos like this❤😊
This is surprisingly relaxing 😌
Do you have to deep fry the rice? I know with popcorn kernels, you can add just 2 tbsp of oil into a pot, and add 1 dl popcorn kernels.
Rachel is so lucky to have a talented cook around!
I love  his cats!!!
That’s a reallllllyyyyyyy nice knife :)
Sottotitoli italiani????
Poki is here . So adorable. He’s disciplined now ❤️
Would love to see either some veggie recipes, tonkatsu or curry recipes. really anything would be great. love your vids.
Неожиданно
So this is how Nestle makes its Crunch Bar
That is such a beautiful knife you're using in this video! I know for sure that my mom would love to use that type of knife when she cooks! 💓
I think some vanilla ice cream would pair well with this dish!
Finally Poki in a video lol
Gum Rice
POKI
You've gotten so many subscribers recently! Woah! I'm so happy for you Jun!
This channel exploded
Can we get an affiliate link for the bowl you deep fried in?
You are awesome 😎 🙌
I don't you
Deserve the trend . Looking up for your next videos .
I love your channel Jun. Dope shataki.
Your vids are really enjoyable keep it up!
You are a like a dream to every woman! Marry me :'D
The cat is just like GIMMIE SOME NOW
Wow what you have over a million subs right now!? That's crazy!! Also really happy for you guys :D
I'm glad to see Poki is behaving for the videos now.  Probably helps that there weren't any meats involved. :)  here in the states they airpop the rice for most puffed rice products I think.  or at least I've never noticed greasy feeling when I eat rice crispies but I may be wrong.
Poki is getting so well behaved. Though meat/fish not being involved probably helps too. :3 So proud
So relaxing to watch your videos 🐈 Upload more 😍
This is so simple, but you've made it into such an elegant presentation. The most unbelievable thing of all...is that Poki is being so good! ^_^
2:07 Absolute satisfaction
This nigga got a weed plant
Ooooh like rice crispies <3 <3
I want to ask if any rice is fine? Since i want to try this with another type of rice. And second, any cooking oil beside canola is fine, too? I'm afraid the rice wouldn't perfectly popped if i use antoher cooking oil  Using cooked rice, and you might end up with fried rice instead of rice crackers, am i right?
STOP TEASING THE CATS >:(
Awesome!
Que hermosos gatitooos💚😽
Does the oil have to be 200 degrees
I wanna be his cat XD
POKI Kreygasm
poki!! 🐱💕💕
Everywhere looks so clean...
Well it official. I'm not getting married unless my husband can cook like you.
Your presentation is always so beautiful!
There's Pocky!!!
ポン菓子とは…ちょっと違うのかな？
poki so well behave
米をそのまま揚げるだと...やりますねぇ！
I like your videos man
im here for the cats
Damn, did he really put that right up on the cats mouths and took a bite out of it? 🤢
Cleanest video I've ever seen
Yay more videos
This was sooooo cool!!!!!! Can you do this with any white rice?!!??!!???
I love how you just give your cats the experience of the smell and to know what are you doing
4:19 kitties like “ get that out of my face boi”.
Everything about this video was absolutely stunning. The recipe seems easy but delicious and the cats are so cute. 😍
Finally, Poki is featured!
cats get to smell but not eat it? animal cruelty
Pokke was surprisingly chill and patient!
I love everything you do! Hugs from Brazil!
Chopsticks with chocolate? Sound like my grandmother
*This is one special and perfect channel!*
Oh! I've always loved crunchy chocolate. Had no clue you could make it so easily at home. Thank you!
How did he manage to get Poki to be so calm??????? I need your secret O_O .. for sure its the same cat who climbed into the trash?
The way he opens chocolate
#5 on trending!!!!!!! Omg 😍😍😍
The way he presented it on the plate, looks so beautiful.
Here (Indonesia) we called it "Rengginang" 🤣..hmm with choco wah i must try it...
Number 5 on trending worldwide!! =O
Awwww!!! 😍😍😍
the most high-class rice crispy cakes i ever saw! ......... and i totally need some right now
Poki is allowed to watch! Such a good boy. I love his fascination with the flying rice.
U can make it with sand too
I love how your cats always want in on the action *sniff sniff sniff*
Are the rice polishing machines public property and anyone can just bring bags of rice there to polish them? Or is it actually a rice polishing room in your uncle's farm? If it's the former, すごい！！！
OH MY GOD that opening shot! <3
Dude made rice crispies
Omg  I didn't even know pop rice existed until now--  I've been living under a rock
disgusting! IS this how you eat all your meals?  Make the cat sniff them first before taking a bite???
Wow.. awesome as always. Your cats are just really awesome hahaha. Good job taming them.
I still loved your polished rusted knife video
Now it's Trending. Awesome.
Did he just make sophisticated chocolate rice crispies ??? I am very impressed and I don't even like basic rice crispies.
Awesome !
Soooooooooooooooooooooooo cool😎 Jun u are awesome 👏🏼
🤭🤯
new video yeahhhhhh
You should try a typical dish from my country, it’s called “churrasco”, and it’s delicious. Basically, it’s just a meat cut with a -kinda spicy sauce- called “chimichurri” and I think you’d love it!
How about a recipe from Food Wars?
The Most Chill of Videos and then the Pop rice just comes over to make a mess. I just shouldn't stop laughing at it, 2:18 making a mess.
Upload more please your amazing I love your videos
Can you do this with an Air Fryer?
Cool!  First time I saw how puffed rice is prepared.  Thanks for your recipe.  It's really worth making. The video has a bonus,  those adorable curious kitties, which I enjoy very much.  Happy Holidays!  Lucilia
This is one of the most relaxing things I've ever watched.  The quality of your videos is just outstanding.  Seriously.  What a zen kitchen!  Natural light, plants, and relaxed kitties.  Please don't ever stop making these videos!  :)
will anykind of rice work or is there a special kind to use?
Poki got to be in the video, yay! Have you tried Cadbury’s?
homemade crunch bar
i swear rachel is sososososososos luckyyyy

1:10 how did he read what’s on that button???
Do you have OCD?? You do things very organized... it’s not a bad thing though
Yummy rice crispy
Damm he and the peaceful  Cousin is my idol xD
So aesthetically pleasing
Every time I see poki I just laugh he's just a funny kitty.
I remember - there's a lot of European candy similar to that. When it said rice on the packaging , I thought it meant by the shape and not ingredients. I never knew rice could turn into an off brand of popcorn.
Wow what a cool knife

Homemade Nestle Crunch Bar. Much prettier than a plain candy bar, though. :)
IM SO AMAZEFUL AT DIS
Such a nice video with nice comments, but now it's trending so prepare yourself for bots
Your videos are so beautiful
This looks so good
(~˘▾˘)~your food
#4 on trending. Yeah go Jun.👍
bro why are you making such amazing food for cats? you should be working in a michelin restaurant!
i like your videos cause they hide a tranquility inside them.... beautiful! thank you for these! love your cats <3
Its good with salt tooo
I wish I could make this for a friend but I have any :(
That presentation though
I was eating popcorn
ポップライス pop rice
I’ve never heard of pop/puffed rice before. Looks fun
I cut my girlfriend hair prank gone wrong !! https://youtu.be/iVzWiEYiA3c
That crow sound..
Your cats are getting you a splash guard for Christmas.
Lol it's like rice crispys
OMG I think this is the best so far 😍😍😍
Ima try this tomorrow.
すごい〜〜
All I see is a crap load of oil splattering and a lot of misc. steps.  Lots if work for such a small reward.   Now if this could done in with a hot air popper and you microwave the chocolate and make one huge bar, that's more efficient use of time.
wish I had your life
Holy rice I want to be his cat !
I see Poki has graduated in his training. But I would seriously love to see some behind the scenes of Poki while filming this video.
I never knew you could pop rice like this.
It's like sapito chocolate from México.
Now combination with poki and haku
thats AMAZING im so glad i clicked on this video
POKI IS IN THE VIDEO!!!
I never knew puffed rice was deep fried rice 😔 why do people say it's healthy and sell it as rice cakes etc oh well no more puffed rice for me then
As usual, your presentation of your creation was devine!!  Very elegant! (^^)(^^)  I thought it was fun how you used the chopsticks to pick up the pop rice chocolate! Oh, your kittens are so beautiful!
GJ Jun, #4 on trending :D
Is there anyway to prevent the puffed rice from going everywhere lol. Cuz with popcorn at least you havr some sort of cover. Granted there is way less oil..
お祭りの時とかよく知らないお兄さんに作ってもらってたな〜懐かしい…😌
Oooohhhh your knife blade is so pretty! I wouldn’t want to use a knife that pretty. I’d want to put it up on the wall as decoration. Thank you for such a quick and easy recipe! 👍🏻😸🌈🌞💖

Here for the kitties
I missed your videos so much! I hope you could upload more, like i've watched everything and I keep on looking back your channel if there was any new video uploaded :D
Haku and Poki are really well trained to not try eating the food handed to them :0
Thanks for the nice comforting video , Puffed rice is an old indian recipe named (Murmura)..usually the method they use is (Hot sand) instead of frying , the most important thing about making (murmura) is using : Short-grain rice ( Better if it was  starchy rice)  , if you used (long grain rice) its going to be like chewing plastic !!! Last thing :  they use (Murmura) a lot in  savory & sweet  recipes . Love mixing them with thick caramel sauce  until become a dough & roll them into popCorn size  Enjoy 👍🏼😁
just a question because he seems like he is gay
wtf are you doing making youtube videos??? you could freaking open up a restaurant
only jun makes eating puffed rice fancy :p
omg, so proud of poki, actually getting to sit still and be in a video!
This is what I call quality content.
Poki is so brave sitting next to the popping rice like that 😮 But i guess when you've been through what he's been through, not much can scare you anymore.
You Are an Artist!
Love your cats .
Never thought I'd say this but...     *Those are some pretty rice*
I actually just had popped rice for the first time in October at a tofu restaurant in Kyoto named Shoraian- it was SO good! Great video, as always!
this video I randomly stumbled upon made me subscribe instantly. So calming and happy.
How have I only just found this channel! Great video and cooking! Looking forward to going through the rest of your videos!
Who eats after his cat sniff the food iiiiwwwwooooo 😫

Lol Poki finally made it in a cooking video! I guess because the ingredients weren't to his taste lol But yay Poki!
Thanks for sharing! It looks yummy!😄
I stumbled on this some 50yrs ago I fixed it for the kids for an after school snack and would not last more then 5min. I use a parboiled rice deep fry in veggie oil in a small pot 1 table spoon at a time on an electric stove for fear of fire using a tea leaf strainer, keep it covered if not it will lose it's crunch over night, it is best to use it ASAP . It can still be used as regular cooked rice, just cook it in water as you would any rice, I have used it in cakes, cookies, salads, ice cream topping, in cake frosting,  as for the kids I used "popcorn sault " to give it a popcorn taste. 1 cup of rice would yelled about 2 cups by volume. Hope you all enjoy
Aesthetic japanese food and video. Please make more beautiful kitchen videos!
どうせならチョコ、和三盆のお菓子みたいな形でも良かったかもね。
Jun's kitchen= family friendly food wars
Can you do it with any kind of rice?
Damn can rice get any fresher than this?
cat breed name ? the ginger one.
途中まで麦チョコ的なお菓子を想像してたw
This video is so relaxing that it almost made me fall asleep
rice crispies. you made rice crispies.
Gotta give this a try! If I don't report back in a day, send Nestle Crunch bars to the scene of my house fire!
猫はかわいいし美味しそうだし主さんの声とても素敵です(；＿；)
I didnt know the rose shaped chocolate until jun took it out, that was the Boss moment for me =)
んー、ポップコーンと言いますかあられ？？的な。
man, i love those cats
cats and food are the best combination of things
Poki in a video that isn’t about him trying to eat anything and everything? What a miracle!
Congrats on trending
Wow that knife is beautiful

So fun

what does the machine do? is it for separate the rice from its skin?
Yay poki is in the video
I love your cats specially the one you took with you out side.... And thanks for the puffed rice I always wandered how it was made.
until now... I thought they removed the husk from the rice grains manually with their fingers....  (but who knows who actually sits in that machine, huh?)
พิมพ์ไทยได้ด้วยหรอครับ?
Love it
congrats on trending
Nice. It would be wonderful to make this in different flavors like how we make “cornick” in the Philippines 🇵🇭! 😊
you live in such a beautiful area oh my goshhh

Cute dog
Was it just a small wetstone you used to polish the knife with?
チョコの開け方かっこいいw

Hey Margot - here is a nice cat person
にゃんこの耳毛長いですね～😽
1:35 And fuck to make ?
いただきます!
You have such amazing cats
The pop rice on the stalk is so lovely. It reminds me of cotton bolls. Rice and cotton are part of Louisiana history; I think a pop rice stalk garnish would be perfect for a Louisiana cuisine menu.

Georgie would be so happy.
Woah thats poprice so cool
Presentation!
Looks pretty tasty bro
精米機やん これは高評価
I love your videos they're so satisfying 💛
Sublime
I want to know how it tastes!
are the rice polishing machine open to the public? pretty cool that anyone can just put some fresh rice in the machine and have it polished.
*drool*
Please marry me.

Does this rice taste better than the one you can buy in the shops?
So relaxing
オシャレだなあ

Your videos are actually addictive
한국어는 자막이 없네요ㅜㅠ
In Indonesia, we call it 'Rengginang'.
А почему русское название?
Is the cat a female? Is it male?
Wow, I didn't know that rice can pop like that.
Puffed rice will stick to my tonsils.. no thanks! I lo e Meiji chocolate and those itsy bitsy baby meiji are fantastic

Looks like it would be great on salad!
There's a breakfast cereal called Rice Krispies in the UK which looks just like yours
ポン菓子？
What's up with the Cats🤣🤣
I can never and would never skip through your videos . Every moment is just amazing and the final results are always mouth watering !
Why do i find it so relaxing?)
いちいちかっこいいですな〜(褒め言葉
アオキスーパーは愛知県にしかないらしいので愛知県民ってことでいいのかな？
u live in Japan, with 2 cats, married and u know how to cook. Where i can get one of those like u in female version? only for experimental things i promess
5 on trending ☺
OOOOHHH NO WONDER I FELT A DEJAVU ITS JUN FROM JUN AND RACHEL HAHAHAHA I THOUGHT I WAS WEIRD FOR THINKING “hmmm why do i feel like i know this person...”
where you guys live? it doesn't look like Tokyo.
毎回撮り方センスあるよなー
This is true art. New sub
I'm late :')
Jun youre on trending?!?!?
This is called farm to table 🤪❤️👍🏻
Its Poki!
Your videos are amazing. The fact that you let your cats smell and taste or interact with whatever your doing in each video shows true love. 😄     Your photography skills for each setup are so creative. I liked watching the rice pop on the actual plant in the pot.  It was an amazing touch. 👌  Don't even get me started with the kitty in the bike basket. ❤   Your videos are very intriguing and  some what addictive. I watched one of your videos I think 3 times because I was amazed on how thin you could cut something. ( by the way you've taught me 20 new ways to cut myself.... 😂 )     Keep up the creativity , and make something special for the kitties for me. 😄
Junさん、なんでも出来てホントに素敵です♪
Such pretty chocolate molds!
I live in bangladesh 🇧🇩 and my grandma does using no oil just stirring raw rice 🍚 in hot pot constantly and its white and crunchy its the just he used oil
Never knew this was even a thing! Amazing
Poki is back!
Love your videos Jun!
Awesome!!!!!!
I want to be one of your cats, just to eat your food in my next life. @.@ (I don't want the relationship just the food, lol so I'm a perfect cat right?) I always want to eat after seeing one of your videos. @.@ Rachel is so lucky. @.@ Can you just ship me your food? XD (I know you can't...) >.<
*Insert cat every 5 fucking seconds to gain publicity and views*
Good to see poki sit still 🌷🐈😍
Idk why but this video is so satisfying😍❤
Jun makes opening chocolate look satisfying! He is a cooking god on earth
This channels gets views really fast
I love the vids keep it up u are talented at entertainment and your cooking and all the amazing things u do
3:05 whats that in his finger?
WHAT? A vending machine for rice grinding?
where is the location in the beginning? I know its Japan but what city? looks so peaceful..
Poki was so good in this video. He actually sat quietly.
in Bangladesh we call it "muri".
I think the chocolate is meji or something like that be a use my mom went to Japan and send a bunch of Japanese chocolate and it's delicious
Luke Skywalker dies and Kylo Ren kills Snoke
Can you upload a video before this year end? That’s our Christmas present pls.
You are good in everything you do! Keep it up! Ouen shitemasu!!!
ラファエルの何倍も好き！
大変素敵で驚きました。 これからも動画頑張って下さい。
would the poprice be soggy with oil after its done cooking?
Wait, how is Poki behaving so well??
this is native to bangladesh
美味しそう😋🍴
Can you do a curry dish soon?
Jun CONGRATS YOU ARE TRENDING~~~ (≧▽≦)
Ffiinnn love your channel 😍😍
Lol and here I thought puffed rice was healthy and involved some complicated industrial pressurizing process to make 😆
im just gona say that is is insanely good how do you get it
Y no filthy Frank in the rice fields?
I can tell you have French culinary education. You have off some techniques.
In the UK we call them rice Krispy's. However we get a big bowl of them and add chocolate to them and make them into cupcakes. There's a snack called squares which are chocolate and mash mellow. Hope that helps.
Let me just put my cats 1 foot away from hot splattering oil. That seems safe..... Oh and I'll let my cats smell the food that I'm going to eat just to rub it in their face. You better watch out because cats naturally want to kill humans, but yours have to have a special hatred for you. haha.
Poki’s in the video for once! 😂😂
This was such a beautiful video
Wonder what type of rice is that??
就是爆米香嘛！
Awesome! I will have to try this some time
on valentine's day jun would be the one to make rachel chocolate lol
POKI!
*HOORAY FOR POKI FINALLY BEING ABLE TO BE IN THE VIDEO*  **cries happy mom tears**
Finaly!!! New video
Looks like tiny popcorn
Makes me happy💕
This is such a retarded channel. Guy is obviously using a cats as a clickbait. I thought cats would eat that what he makes, you know for a comedy, yet this is not even a comedy. How is this entertaining again?
It looks delicious similar to Japanese sweets! I would like to make it!
お米でポップコーン出来るのか、驚きだわ
Your videos are aesthetically pleasing. Love this, I wish I could subscribe to you more then once haha
日本人いますかー🙋
Just add sea salt then you cant stop eating :3
What type of cook top is that?
凄いいいい
I tried it and for some reason, my rice just completely gave up on life and shriveled up. It looks nothing like yours. Any reasons as to why this happened?
Wow I didn't know you could do the same to rice as corn !
The  person who cuts it with English can cook, and is enviable. I have to exert myself, too
How does the rice get enriched?  I thought polished rice had no nutrients and as a rule had to be enriched
really adorable cat!!! love'em!!!
Yum 🙂
All things in this video are beautiful
#5 on trending! You've come so far :) (and the cats too haha)
美味しそう( '﹃'⑉)
That knife is so cool looking. 0 2:59 - 03:10
前々から思ってたけど、JUNさんの住んでるところめちゃくちゃ綺麗
liked and subcribed for your chanel!
Rice krispies I love em!!
Welcome to the rice fields!
I bet you can just have the cats sit in the video for ten minutes and expect lots of views from it
It's so beautiful where you live.
Oh finally new episode
I thought you were going to say "this time I decided to make popcorn, but with poki"
jun opens chocolate with style
i love these videos so much they always make me so happy
You're videos are extremely relaxing
I didn't know "puffed rice" was a thing.
I’m admired Japanese agriculture system. It’s must be useful to have a machine like that in the village.
Is it just me or are Jun's videos just naturally calming???
What does that button you pushed say?
more than the recipe im here for Haku😍
damascus steel
poki in a cooking video!!!! so happy!! ^^
in bengal we call it "muri" and it's fried on hot sand ^_^
これは、ラファエルも真似したくなるよな
I love how your cats are like little versions of you and Rachel!  Orange and black hair.  :)
신기하게 고양이들이 먹지는 않네
omg i just went to a japanese restaurant the other day and they had this puffed rice on the stalk!
Looks so good... especially the rice on the stalk. Haku is my favorite cat, but I love that Poki is finally well behaved enough to sit in on the food prep.
Also, that little logo down in the right hand corner of the screen is really expressive of the channel and well done.
This is calmingg.... especialy the rice popping sound. Although when the rice went everywhere it stressed me a little haha
I just love how interested your cats always are when you are cooking
これ、ポン菓子ではいかんのか？
Can you use any rice or does it have to be a specific kind?  I tried this but most of my rice just burned
#5 on trending! Im so proud!
Your videos are so relaxing, keep up the good work!
Hiya Jun (・ω・)ノ   I’m in love with this idea to be honest I’ve never tried this recipe and I was wondering can this recipe be done with any type of rice or I need a certain type of rice in order to achieve the final results?
Finally u upload more vids <3 love ur cats and ur videos editing :D
SO GLAD TO SEE POKI IN A VIDEO!!
CONGRATS on making on the 5 trendinggMy favorite youtuber😍😂
Congratulations on being top 5 on Trending!
JUST LOVE THOSE CHILLED OUT KITTIES 💞.     Thanks from England
I let my cats taste my food too before i eat them in that way if it was poison were both gonna die
Just subscribed for the cats 😍
omg in Indonesia, we called it 'Rengginang'
I am always excited when your new video pops up!! It's just so nice to watch you and the cats.... really hope to see the next video soon ❤️
Beautiful video!!
cats are not faithful like dog
I love cats, I have one too
That attention to details ...  I love watching it on videos, I absolutely hate doing it in my kitchen :)  I'm a free Latino spirit after all... (Translation: I can't be arsed to do it) To be honest it has become a bone of contention between me and my Japanese wife. She loves my cooking but she absolutely hates seeing me making a mess in the process .  Even if I do clean AFTERWARDS. :) Go figure.  But yeah, AH-MAZING video Jun san once again..
I like the chill vibe
Bro 1 mil subs with videos up to 5 mil views? INSANE
#5 on TRENDING !! yay
Japanese Gorden Ramsay
amazing as always
Who was controlling the drone at 0:11 ??
I want to visit japan so badly now, the area that you cycle in, looks like it came out of an anime lol so beautiful
200°C=392°C      If you saw patrick's comment, you will see that she/he might have seen the captions. Check, cause he says it. And sorry if I mistaken it, "Patrick".
who would dislike this?
My complete attention is only towards the beautiful cats throughout the video.
it seems like every video you post gets on the trending list way to go Jun
He made knock-off crunch bars
In Bangladesh it is called Muri.. 😊
I’m surprised poki didn’t dive in and eat it all 😂
So beautiful the puffed rice twig
Everytime I watch his videos and an ad plays before, I always let it play, because you can tell when a YouTuber likes what he does. And I know he doesn't post a lot of videos, but I think it's quality over quantity. He is one of the few YouTubers who has stayed true to what he likes and not deviate from what they like just because of the views. Anyways keep it up 👍
Which part of japan is this? Looks beautiful!
所以是ㄅㄥˇ vi ㄆㄤ嗎？((求閩南語高手解釋
Cooking with Poki, Yeih :D
Its so beautiful!!!!! U cook real well!!! *UR CATS R ADORABLE*
Poki is so well behaved and its amazing
The footage for this video is soo pretty, it’s really relaxing
家の清潔感がやべぇ
Hey hello Poki 😄 wonderful debut in jun's kitchen 😊 you seem to be a very good boy now. Did you wanted to join the other cats so badly? 😊 that's nice.
(From USA)  Wow!  Homemade Crunch/Krackle bars!  I've never thought of rice as "pretty", but the popped rice stalk changed my mind.  Two simple ingredients, but that plate was a work of art.  Is there a huge difference in taste between homemade popped rice and purchased?
ポン菓子とはまた違う感じ？美味しそうだしやってみたい！
I'm in love with this channel, post more videos :)
I didn't know rice did this lol
The opening scene is beyond beautiful as always. I love it so much 💕 Anyway that popcorn rice with chocolate looks delicious
I'm here cuz of cat
yeay Poki is the video. I am touched~
The cat is so cure
Welcome to the rice fields MADAFAKA!
Reminds me of rice cakes 😂😂 Love the video

You are married?
(๑•̀ω•́๑)
YAYYYY NEW VIDEO
Where do you live? may i know ? because it looks so beautiful and peaceful
This world has so much creativity 😁     Nevermind 😞
Wow Jun that plating was beautiful! Also, wow Jun, you are number five on trending! gj
*Trending once again my friend.*
Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t puffed rice is eaten for breakfast over here(here being the U.S.)?
Rachel is a lucky girl XD
Thanks. I had no idea what rice looks like before it gets packaged and placed on a shelf in a supermarket.
#5 on trending congrats jun!!
Great again. Your video are always so good.
日本語に(ホッ)
Congrats on #5 trending
Making chocolate with cats? Σ(°Д°;
wow nice intro. tho its kinda late here in japan . its freezing. those rice have been harvested  you got a drone nice
I'm confused what was the machine he used to process the rice to make it whiter and cleaner
I look foward to your videos, and to see your kitties!  What is the machine you used in beginning of the video? Thank you
👏
How do you make something as inelegant (over here it's a kid's snack) as puffed rice chocolate look so aesthetic whatt 4:02 could be a magazine spread
Nice Video :D How about a Video with a Christmas-Recipe? :D
Jun makes opening a Hershey bar so fascinating.
#5 trending 🔥🔥🔥
I like your intro. Your videos are always very calming and make me happy. Thank  you.
That Damascus knife though
:D
Jun, canola oil is bad!!! Don’t use ir
its just a deep fried rice and a chocolate and yet you make it into a really beautiful dish 😍 love it man
EVERYBODY THIS MAN HAS A WIFE AND SHE IS HOT😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤗😍😍😍😍😍 JUST SAYING
This is the first time I've seen rice being popped. Can any kind of rice be popped?
美しい
#5 trending 👌👏🏻
How did you do the shots at the beginning?
Don't just melt and freeze chocolate. If you're willing to spend that kind of time on a project like this, then temper the chocolate properly.
I love your videos!  Greetings from Colombia.  :)
what beautiful heartwarming video
Immm ssoooo excitedddd
This is number five on trending?!?!?!?!???!!!! Wow!!!! Great job Jun!
WHY CANT i BE THE ONE EATING THAT!!!!
The presentation of that plate is phenomenal! That is awesome!!
When a spin-off channel has more subscribers than the main channel...
いわゆるポン菓子を圧力かけて一気にやる機械なしでやってる感じなのかな？
Your videos turn me into a monk. Every time I watch one, I feel this great surge of Zen lol
Why are all this guy’s videos so calming to the damn soul???!
弾けたやつが猫に当たらないか心配してしまう…
Poku is there too :3
Woww
do we have to boil the rice beforehand or just put it in the oil uncooked?
Japan, free from "Diversity" and J-left.
YAY MY DAD IS TRENDING...
ポン菓子みたいな味なのかな🤔
IT'S #5 ON TRENDING NOW! JUN, WE'RE HUNGRY FOR YOUR VIDEOS!! I know you're busy, and making a quality video like this takes a lot of time, but can you upload weekly, or maybe once every two weeks please :'(? We keep rewatching and rewatching your old videos though. WE NEED MOREEEEEEEE
Nestle Crunch 😂
Aww poki being a very good boy 😊
*Logan Paul* is a POOP HEAD!!!!!
米がポップコーンになるんだな笑
Wow rice become a flower! It looks like magnolia:)
In english its rice krispies
is your knife Valyrian steel
I love how you let your cats smell the food
I love how Jun presents his food, he’s an artist 👌🏻
Popcorn cats!
I love your Japanese cuisine videos, but out of curiosity do you cook other things too? Sadly I can only cook Honduran food :/ I don’t have time to try to cook new dishes
wow! last time I visited your channel had about 700k subs but now you have more than 1 million subs!!
Beautiful village!!!
Finally! New upload ;D
I have had it since i was a kid. Very common for my place to eat that
Your drone shots are to die for! Thank you so much for this vid and inspiring me to make my own chocolate ^.^
Next: Fruity Pebbles
In my country we have pop rice with sweetened coconut milk(coconit milk+coconut sugar) It tastes so gooooooooood😆
1. Your uncle grows rice. Very cool! 2. Japan has machines that dehusks rice that people can just use. Even cooler!
Hmm I should try popping some of my rice
Good job on #5 on trending! That’s awesome!
Is this the first time Poki's been in a cooking video?
ねこちゃんに油が跳ねそうでちょっと怖い(´•ω•｀)チョコ寸止めされた時の表情かわいい！癒される～
So that’s how they make rice krispys.
can this be done with any type of rice like the one I would buy at a super market
congrats on making this video top 5 on trending
Oooh a logo!
its too oily..just take the rice with its skin and roast in sand..indian style of making puffed rice..healthy too
Whoaa so this is how to make the sweet version of it ._.  I never knew it before since in my country we eat salty version traditionally lol  Thanks for the video Jun, you're awesome!
Your Videos are beautiful
Those knife
Jun is always trending when ever he post a video. ✨
YESSSSSS!! A NEW VIDEO! I KEPT REPEATING YOUR VIDEOS AGAIN AND AGAIN
ポン菓子!!!!!!!!!!
ラファエルと同じ包丁や
honestly, i'd probably just eat the popped rice by itself.. dunno why
Jun's hands move like he is a martial artist. Graceful.  Every moment flows to another with no wasted movements.
damn how many takes did take to do this? LOLs.
Omg poki is behave now
I'm here for the naughty booooy!
Woaaah this snack would be a great company while working in front of computer!! Btw, does it work with any other kind of rice? Or is it work only with japanese rice?
Haku is so chill I can't get over it 💕
Cool! I want to try this!
Looks like Jun got a drone!!!!!!
These videos make me erect
I bet Haku, Nagi, and Poki are hungry looking at you eat. 😹
the sound of the knife cutting chocolate is so soothing
手出ししてこないのは調理中はあまり相手にされないって理解してるからなのかな
猫ちゃんに油はねそうで怖いです
OMG Poki was actually tamed in this video?!
Homemade rice crispies!! Without all the added sugar and preservatives. Great video jun!
I thought this was going to be a rice infuse with chocolate.
#6 on trending! 😄😄😄
うぽつです 急上昇おめっと(* • ω • )b
Rachel better have got to eat some of this! I know how she complains about never getting to eat anything from the show.
都会の人は精米機とか使ったことないんだろうな
Sub to yo boi
I seriously didn’t realize you could make popped rice at home! I wonder if it’d be a good substitute for popcorn, which sometimes bugs my gut, because there are no hulls.
OOOOOO i didnt know this was how u make it XD
Always enjoyable to watch.
Does Japan have those rice processing machines everywhere or is it just near farming communities? Those are really cool.
He should be on master chef
If i put it in a bowl with milk will it "Snap Krackle Pop?" Or is this different?
とても良いので•••が大好きです。ありがとうねジューンさん  正か?
The raw rice looked gorgeous.
Popcorn + rice = price
Can you make kimchi??
Muri 😂😂😂
Look at that knife 😍 the designs are beautiful!
your cats are so amazing!
Number 6 on trending!!
This whole video is so aesthetic I love it
Just order Taco Bell and then you won’t have to cook all the time. Duh.
Why you don't apply Korean? ㅠㅠ
Jun hy do you make food look so beautiful?
素晴らしい
That looks beautifully delicious
wow number 6 on trending, as always Jun you did a fantastic job and i look forward to your next videos.
maybe we call this okaki in Japan
Can you make an ASMR video?I mean,I love the sound that when you are chopping the chocolate
きれー、、
It's just amazing!! I tried and succeeded
Your videos are so entertaining!! Jun is getting better and better. Good quality as well.
I think I should try making this. Thank you, Jun-sensei.
なんか……癒される……
nice intro
Why is this 6th on trending?
So is this like rice crispy stuff?
Hi Jun!  I really love your videos.  I have a question though. Does it have to be a certain kind of rice to make this or can I use any kind of rice?  And does it have to be canola oil to fry it?  Thanks!
i love the music in the background.
Your videos are always so calming and beautiful to watch
お、気になると思ってみたら....      日本人いねぇぇぇぇぇ！！！！！゛゛゛
OMG It's #6 Trending
my cat could never do this omg, he loves eating anything and everything so he’d be on the counter trying to eat while i cook
Could i ask what part of japan you live in would love to visit as it seems so peaceful!
I'm so excited that poki could join!!! 私はぽきが参加できることに興奮しています
Looks like tonsil stones..
🌾お正月の料理の飾りで使ったことある

I guess the black and white kitty finally stopped stealing ingredients cx
キタアアアアアアアアアアアアア ずっと楽しみにしてました！！！！！
I'm just here for the cats.
Who else thought about  Rice Krispys
ポンポン菓子って言うの私だけ…？ お米のポップコーンが普通？
That’s so cool!
Always make good videos
ah sounded cool but it didnt work :/
So you don't use fire to melt the chocolate?
Try making popcron ice cream
The place you were riding your bike with your cat reminded me of the place from my neighbor totoro
This video is just popping out in You Tube's trending section.
I like ur cats.
omg Jun, you're #6 on trending! Congratulations! I love your videos, you deserve it. :)
PLEASE MAKE TAKOYAKI
Glad to see another of your videos
so cute and relaxing!!! i always love your videos and the cats are darling-poki is, as always, a cute disaster.
If you have an Indian store around, you will find rice puffs for very cheap...make chocolate glazed or caramel glazed puffed rice...,yummm
あげてる時に猫ちゃん危ないような気がしました…
いやー  猫に癒されますわ〜
2:51 Perfect

日本人はチョコレートを箸で食べるのかって思われてそう

Man.. This is art! Great video as always
June videos are goals 🙌
It’s trending!!
0:12 の映像とか どうやって撮影してるんだろう、、、  気になる
#6 on trending! Congrats Jun!
Your movements are so satisfying to watch!
Trending #6 🔥💕👏
I am sure this sounds stupid but I had no idea this was how rice comes out of the field. Then to have a location to process it ... amazing again. Also did not know you could pop rice like this... so much new!
Eu quero ser um gatinho dele :,) ❤
exquisite as always !  (I am repeating myself, I know, but it is sincerely from the bottom of my heart every time) Thank you, Jun (& waves to Rachel behind the camera *smiles*)
So that's how chocopuffs are made. Like
YES IT'D TRENDING! MB
I love how the cats watch the process, and get to smell the ingredients and the finished product but it's not fair to tease them!
I'm surprised Poki watched you cook. I kind of expecting Poki to go into the plastics bin again. :P
not gonna lie, part of the reason that I love your videos it that I get to watch your cats watch you cook. :)
ただチョコを湯煎してるだけなのになんでこんなにオシャレなんだ‥‥
Wow. Your videos are so serene that I feel like it's a glass of beer after a hard day's work. As usual, godly job on the editing! :D
結婚してください
This video is too wholesome for the internet
It’s strange seeing Poki be so well behaved while you cook.
Rangginang
It's so weird that you posted today because a few of us were talking about your videos today at work. Nothing but good things were said
All of your videos make me sooo much more excited for my upcoming trip to Japan (in 2019 lol)! I'm surprised Poki managed to behave haha. As always, this was incredibly beautiful and informative to watch, cats make it perfect, 10/10. You absolutely deserve your YouTube fame.
Jun, you have a gift for making such beautiful videos. So talented
oh my GOD that popping noise was so satisfying
Why do I find this creepy?
Isn't it dangerous for your cats so close to the hot oil and the jumping rice puff?  Can't predict what they will do....
you and your cat have so much trust!!
日本人いる？
HOW ARE EVEN REAL
Dude Jun! Congrats on getting on trending so much! You're killing it! 👍
The Cats: Okay Hooman. We see it is not poisoned. You may feed us now this treat. HOOOMAN!!! STAP!!!
GAAHHH😍 #6 on trending!!! NOW EVEN MORE PEOPLE GET TO SEE YOUR AMAZING VIDEOS 🧡
I swear his videos get better and better every video he is the greatest man I love his vids
Why do you let your cats sniff everything? Just curious
2:18 Cat be like "TAKE COVER!!"

Aww Poki!
お米も穀物だからポップコーンに出来るのかな？あと、なんか猫じゃらしでもポップコーン出来るって聞いたことがあるけど本当かな？とにかくまたお米も猫じゃらしもポップコーンにしてみようかな(笑)
I seriously didn't know you could make pop rice. May have to try this one day when I have some free time :) Thanks Jun!!
cooking video with poki in it? that's impossible
すごく良い環境のもとに住んでそうなので音フェチ動画も見て見たいです😍
*That Rice Was Popping*    I didn't know I could do that XD*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP0x1xPJiRQ&t=82s
another beautiful video, Jun!
hey
You know cats can get very sick from chocolate and even die so I suggest you keep it away from them
油から跳ねたポップコーン当たって、猫ちゃん痛くないのかな😂
aw~ Poki can be this cute when saw you cooking. i'd like to see Poki when you make another video ❤ thanks for the recipe~
In Indonesia it called "rengginang"
美味そう…
Poki!
I, as a Korean, eat rice alot. But I had no idea what it looked like as a plant.
I'm so happy poki's in the video 😸😸😸
If we use long grain rice do we change the cooking time?
I love your videos...came here for those cats.
*You gotta upload more, these are too wholesome*
他人の動画で日本人ー？とか点呼とんの多くね？海外のアーティストの動画にもわらわらいて笑う
ジュンさんの動画きた!!! どれだけ待ったことか！！😭
Who is hungry now
Rice crisped and coco pops formula has been EXPOSED!!! thank Jun. :)
Jun, I love your cooking!! You do an amazing job when you cook!!!
Can´t believe Poki is behaving!!! Love your vides,Jun
1nd!!!
Wonder if even a video like this gets demonized
I tried this just now with dried packaged rice and you probably need to soak it for a bit and pat it dry. the water content is what makes it pop
Congratulations on being #7 on trending!!!!
ah i just noticed nagi in the background >w< so cute
You know, as good as his cooking (and knife skills) are to watch, I truly think he could direct.  They are always so very well done.  Perhaps it's the editing, I don't know, but of all the YouTube videos I watch his are some of the most cinematic...
I logged into my account just so I could give you like. Your videos are gold! Keep up the good work. (^_^)
Surprised he didn’t eat the popcorn with chopstick
Yesssss another video! You make me so happy jun ^^
more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more
Wow!!!! Poki is there! Finally, he's featured in JunsKitchen!! <3
I love cats and I love rice. This video is perfect
You’re so good at cooking  Jeez Jun
Wait, does Japan have public rice cleaners?... Was that even what the second machine was?
say hello my uncle がま○こに聞こえるって言うのはありますよね。
Rachel is *sooo* lucky 😫
This is a weird question but has anyone tried to steal your cat or has anyone taken them when you get items from the store or a field? I mean if you leave it unattended then it isn’t to safe. Not saying you should take your cats with you if if you feel safe leaving the cat(s) by themselves outside it’s fine but just wondering.
Make more videos it took you a long time to upload ur videos
*opening scene* Me: Does Jun have a drone now?!
貓咪不能吃巧克力
Amazing and beautiful recipe!! So happy you came back!
Poki was such a good boy for this video! Your cat training is proving to be effective, Jun!
Finally a new relaxing video

Now THAT’S the way to get rice!  Beautiful video, as always, Jun!  I just love these!  You’re such an artist.
i think i might actually be addicted to watching your videos
#8 trending ????!!!!
#8 on trending!!!!
Sooo pretty!  😍
The purest channel on youtube
RICE CRISPY!
In America we can buy these in boxes as cereal and eat them with milk 😍
Petlovers please always remember never to give chocolate to your pets. It's toxic for them and WILL kill them even in small amounts. The same is true for raisins and grapes, and kiwis. Be safe. Also a little reminder that cats dont are basically celiacs (but not dogs). Awesome vid tho. I love how it looks like cotton still on the plant.
Dang number 9 on trending with no click bait        Congrats
*Struggles Opening chocolate wrapper*
I did this with rice from Trinidad now I might have to get a new pot!😞
I swear I never knew you could pop rice  And I swear I never connected the cereal "Rice krispies" with pop rice before. I swear I never knew this. Justthought Kellogs came up witha cute name or something....lol
*R I C E C R I S P I E S*
HI POKI
Pop rice looks great, your cats are cute and good behavior.
So it's like American rice krispies cereal? Or is it something else?
凄い〜私でも簡単に出来そう、、今度やってみよ
Do the two of you still help plant the rice each year?  Sure is nice that your uncle grants you some of the harvest.  Why do you polish the rice that high?  Isn't it the rice more nutritious if it is brown in color having the B vitamins the drawback could be the magnesium but the western diet it is very needed. PS: Was that the youngest cat?
Love Jun's Kitchen!!! Tell us about the rice machine; where do you find them, are they coin operated, does everyone have one near their house, can everyone buy a bag of rice from the field? I don't think I've seen rice close up that has just been harvested. I'd like to know more. I've only seen the wet rice patty fields. in movies.
why chop when you are melting it anyway
じゅんの漢字教えてください
(Long Sigh) so simple yet so pleasent to watch 😮😄
Can i use vegetable oil instead of canola oil?
Great idea! Pass the cat's bacteria onto the food and then eat it.
What kind of burner is that? Very curious and am looking for a portable burner. Thanks in advance! Love the videos!
So making this snack for my birthday
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CAN MAKE POP OUT OF RICE
日本人おらん…
You can go American and Asian at the same time!!!
Poki's been a good boy!
One of the best channels on YouTube. 😺😹🎥🚴🍫👫👏😁😂
この方は日本人なのかな？
ポン菓子？
2:50 why did that look so fucking cool
That looks so delicious!  I like how Im watching a video on making a sweet fun treat & I just made myself some baked yams (topped with sugar, nutmeg, & cinnamon after baking..also found out its good to eat with marshmellows). I would love to see you make baked sweet potatoes :)
I love this channel
Are those the chocolate molds from when Rachel handmade chocolates for Jun?
yay Jun's video! also what is this magic rice machine?
POKI IN A VIDEO!!!!
Is it odd that I am proud of poki for behaving for this video? >-<
I love puffed rice! Especially in chocolate, it's so good! <3
You deserve way more than 1 million subscriber
*W H O L E S O M E*
That machine you used to clean the rice is interesting. Is it on your uncle’s farm or did you have to go to someplace special?
is puffed rice healthy since it is deep fried?
いつも美味しそうな動画を 涎たらしながら観て 猫達に癒されています(=ﾟωﾟ)ﾉ 我が家も猫飼いですが ウチの猫は可愛い顔して凶悪なので 大人しい猫さん達が羨ましいです… ところで、 もぅ直ぐお正月ですが、 お正月料理の動画は撮られませんか？ ジュンさん流の 御節やお雑煮や正月料理が観てみたいです。 よろしくお願いします(｡-人-｡)
It's trending #8 !!
You are such a master of presentation, Jun!
Teach pet jump
Trendddyyy
Wow
I thought they call cereals 😂
Im request fried cat           Im joking
That is so cool!!!!
When you live in the city and the place looks like the province  Me:cri
I wanna live in Japan
Does it make a difference if you wash the rice before frying it?
Ima try this
thank you sooo much for the cc! i love your channel!
2:50 I love how Jun is so extra while opening the chocolate 😂😂
Gives me that lucky golden cat.
Phil - "THIS IS THE POPCORN OF RICE!!!"
Omg jun is alive!
I’m trying this right now!!!
この動画全体的にめっちゃ癒される…! 素敵な動画をありがとうございます。 ポン菓子に似てますね笑
Your cats are so polite. Mine has to hold onto anything he sniffs and knocks things over :P
Poki!!
This is why i subscribe
Wow! This was super cool! I actually learned a lot of things from this video. It was really cool to see you get the rice hand picked and then take it to that little machine and have it cleaned or whatever. I've never seen that before. Also seeing the popped rice in the chocolate looked soooo yummy!! I'll definitely have to try this some time. Thanks a bunch Jun!
Fried rice hahahah
I'm confused,so you use popping rice instead of regular rice because when I tryed making it, it just burned up and turned brown
Eating chocolate with chopsticks...that's next level Asian
It's always nice to see something new from you
Wait, so any rice will puff like that?
Wanna try it soon..  Thank's Jun !
米花
awwwww poki made it into a video! <3
Dude why is this so relaxing
Poki!! I see he was being good lol
毎回めっちゃ美味しそう(*´﹃｀*)
Can any rice be popped like that? Where I'm from, we usually have long grain rice.
I just noticed Poki is in the video xD
In our country...its cooked in sand
精米機？はじめて見ました(*^^*)
HES BAAAACCK
popped rice! Never seen anyone do that before. I thought it was a much harder process since no one seems to do it. Q. does it need to be sticky rice or do you think any rice should pop? Also the rice cleaning machine was awesome. Thank you for sharing!
Is that Poki? Looks like he gained a lot of weight! :D
I didnt know that rice can pop
I love your channel. They're calming, entertaining and informative. These are quality videos.
wtf this blew my mind!!!!!!
Loved this!
Could you make a video on how you clean up your kitchen and kitchenwares?
めっちゃ大人しい猫ちゃん
Rice at indo much bigger tgan japanese rice
Cool!  Would probably go well with grapes, cherry or strawberries when serging.
I want poki
When you realise he made homemade rice crispies 😱
これ最初どうやって撮影してんだろ 空から？
見てて癒しだわ*ˊᵕˋ*
We want how to sharp a knife
Your uncle seems really nice.
JUN! Can we meet your uncle or have an adventure on their little farm? I had no idea that you could make this sort of treat. Love your videos!
(Haku & Poki sniffing chocolate) NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! Anyway try long grain rice too Jun. You can get bigger puffs, and bigger is always better!
お米を揚げていた時、お米に花が咲いたような感じですね！  お醤油かけたら美味しそう(๑･﹃ ･๑)ｼﾞｭﾙ
Your uncle has a really cool and interesring job
Love from Korea
Thank you Jun! Would you be able to make Japanese Curry?
P O K I
Where did you get that great little stove? Lovely video, thank you!
When making or setting chocolate molds, tap and shake so you have no air bubbles and it fills the whole mold without any air pockets. 😊
You have no idea how happy I am to see Poki in the kitchen watching Jun cook :D
Most of you will be working in the medical field after college...but me...      I’ll be in the rice field 😏😏
Can I make this with different types of rice?
今回も日本の良さが凄く篭った動画で凄く良かったです( ˆ࿀ˆ ) 板チョコを包丁で開けるの凄すぎですね…
I guess the best way to eat puffed rice is when added to other food. I tried it on its own before and it’s a bit bland.
say hello マ○コに聞こえたのは俺だけじゃないはず
Go on MasterChef! You are so good at cooking and presentation!
LETS TALK ABOUT THAT DAMN PRESENTATION!! 💕😲😲
Aww Poki is watching u cook Jun how cute.
rice krispies in the uk 😁
精米にしてくれる機械があるなんて初めて知りましたよ 凄いな
The best part of your videos apart from those cute cats are probably your plating skills :D
in Indonesia its called rengginang hahahah
WOW 😮 I learned something new!  Love your video!!!! Keep it going 👍💕
お疲れ様です！のどかな田舎で良いですね👌💕

Where can you buy the portable stove he is using? It looks so sleek. I can't find it on amazon.
Poki and Haku’s synchronization on the licking of their lips was so cute haha.  Jun your videos are always so lovely, beautiful and calming. Your plating is so elegant.
sugoi o.O looks frikin awesome!!

*YES* *IT’S* *POKI!!!!!!!*

Make a grilled cheese sandwich
Poki got to join!!!!
YOUR WINDER FULL

猫がおりこうだな
does it have to be canola oil? or can I use regular oil?
That's like the highest tier crunch bar ever 😂😂😂
It's so calming, and informative. Well executed for sure! Good job!
What rice so i use o tried semit brown and brown roce but both didnt work
Hay mucha perfección en estos vídeos
How long does it take for the water to melt the chocolate ?
Poookiiii! <3
Amazing
SOOOO CUUUUTE!!!
のどかな所でいいですね！
It's so nice to see Poki in the kitchen! : ) The puffed rice on the stem is really pretty.
じゅんさんのコメ欄英語コメしか無いww日本人おらんの？

This channel blew up so fast it's awesome!  Hope he can turn out more videos quicker since they are so good.
動画上がるごとにクオリティーが上がっていく笑
Love your videos so much! They're so calming and relaxing.

Jun you are amazing you have great cats they are so obedient. What do you do when you say I will be back to your cat? What do you do with your cat?
稻米花～
Why don't you open a restaurant already
Luv you Jun!!
Twas gr8
Popcorn rice that sounds good
you're an artist , i love your cat <3
Poki!!! <3
Aww, so accessible and simple, yet seems so elegant in the end product. And of course, your cute kitties always make the process extra enjoyable and calming to watch take place. <3
Are there any salty snacks with popcorn rice ? :O
Good job Poki!!! He seemed so calm :)
I’m so happy your posting again 🙌🏽
Happy weekend
You are a food artist! I enjoy your cooking videos. 🥘 🎥 🍿 🐈
Is that a hemp plant in the background? Juns420Kitchen
Omg poki actually in a Jun's kitchen video and behaving!!  I really love the way the rice looks popped on the stock it looks really pretty!
Its like pinipig in the philippines or rice crispies in english
キタ〜。幸せだ
Can i eat it with milk just like cereal? 😁 haha
カメラワークがすごい
That was really cool!!
Hey poki stayed put! Good kitty
💕
1)  I love this family of channels.  2)  Poki!  3)  I may have to do this with my homemade chocolate.
0:37どこからとっとん？
Finally! A new video!
I know your cats don't try to touch anything, but i get so scared and anxious whenever they're around fire or sharp objects, cuz my cat is crazy and he tries to slap anything around him, so everytime i get so scared they're gonna touch the fire haha, also i can never take my cat outside cuz he's never been out and he'll try to leave his box. I hope one day he can behave as good as your cats haha ♡♡
Woah junskitchens videos are pretty eye popping        Get it haha no pun intended
Ooh I see that Kramer knife! okay!
Aesthetic to the max! Wow jun ur videos and recipes calm me down and look delightful! I hope this video trends! Sending love from New York 💋
So delicate and beautiful! Congrats!!
As a mother of three fur babies, I just have to tell you how gorgeous your kitties are!!!
Great recipes. The main reason I watch however, is how organised and clean and tidy you are. It's very satisfying.
When you see Poki in the thumbnail and you're like "Poki in A VIDEO?! What sorcery did you use!?"
Make more videossssss
This is probably the earliest I've ever been to a Jun video. As always, amazing job!
Who's here before it hits one million
My kitty loves popcorn! Only give him homemade white made w coconut oil.
Is this the first time Poki appeared in JunsKitchen?
Great to see how far Poki has come since you guys first got him, look at him all calm and peaceful in the video!
he is back...          gawsdfbhjnkml,;.aszgbhnm,.
I JUST WATCHED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE AND POKI NOW WATCHES WITH THE CATS AND CONTROLS HIMSELF IM SO HAPPY
my cat eat popcorn
looks like someone upped their production...
This is so aesthetically pleasing. Omg. Also, is Jun left-handed or is he so amazing that he's ambidextrous?
Poki!!!! 😘😘
Aaww, reminds me so much of Bali where I first picked stalks of rice ,they dry it on the ground in the sun.
ITS JUST PUFFED RICE AND CHOCOLATE BUT WHY DOES IT LOOK SO AESTHETIC DJFSUOGHDBNFSEURS
oooohhh poki is becoming a good boy
楽しみにしてた！ ＆急上昇ランク入ってる！
誰か日本人いますか?
Every time Jun's Kitchen posts a video he ends up on the Trending tab, I absolutely love it
Yummy I love brown rice it is my favorite.
I love your videos so much, the intro was so beautiful!
Here in Ireland we have rice crispes (there basically puffed rice) and we eat them for breakfast with milk
I so want to do this now! I recently got puffed rice as an ingredient for granola bars. Might have to consider just making my own when I run out. :D
I am surprised always by your knowledge and skills.  It never even crossed my mind to think about puffing rice, and the chocolate melting method is wonderful.  You have such aesthetic skills.  It also amazes me that there is a way of hulling rice in Japan with finesse, because when i lived in Indonesia as a child, all the women used a large mortar and a four foot pestle to clean the hulls off.  When courting couples are talking during the early evening, the parents listen to the rhythm of the pestle and if it stops, they come to inspect the rice to see if it is ready.
😉 amazing !!!!!!
That looks delicious!! Awesome video :)
When you said, "Hey guys," I thought you were talking to you're cats LOL.
Yesss! Jun posted!!
急上昇入ったね
ポン菓子やんけ
So beautiful your cats!  Be carefull he is so near to the hot oil!
So This Is How They Make Rice Krispies..
nice to see poki being in the thumbnail for once. :)
Your videos are infinitely beautiful and calming. There is nothing that can make me forget about my troubles or an unpleasant day the way your amazing videos do. Thank you so so much for existing and sharing your creativity and adorable cats
Your kitties are adorable❤️❤️
ANOTHER VIDEO :)
here in Texas we have something called rice crispy treats, it's basically the same but in a bar shape held together with a syrup and marshmallow fluff
brilliant.
クオリティ高すぎ笑笑
Wow nice editing. So professional. This looks so fun to make
コイン精米ですらおしゃれに見せる男
Bags with zippers? IS JAPAN LIVING IN 4017?
Lol when you're so Asian you eat chocolate with chopsticks...
How do you get these shots? Do you have a drone?
Woah has Poki become a good boy who doesn't destroy things?!
Yes, it is puffed rice
Did Poki behave for this video ?
A big thumbs up for Poki being in a video!! Yaaay!
Looks Good I love all your Kitties sitting by you cooking
I love eating puffed rice! I used to eat it all the time as a kid
ずっと待ってました！
Me: YESSSSS
I love this chanel 😍😍 and haku is really a good boy😘
A little observation on my part but next time Jun you should drop the mold on the counter a couple of times to get rid of the air bubbles. The chocolate will look better that way
It's really cool to see Pookie chilling out now and not eating all your food :p
My favorite channel of all time ❤
Liked it before watching lol
Yay! Poki is joining!
You literally just made my favourite breakfast cereal what the heck, that's so much cheaper than buying it branded
Your cat is so beautiful
It's Poki!
oh the sound of him cutting chocolate🤤
Jun you should try to make a dish form the anime 食戟のソーマ or food wars for example the salmon dish that ryo kurokiba makes during his 食戟　on season 3 episode 10
I was thinking you made Dig 'Em Sugar Smacks from my childhood, but those turned out to be puffed wheat https://youtu.be/29CukzLXUww
You need to get on the cooking channel! You are so great to watch.
Your videos are such a pleasure to watch. Some landscape shots, soft music, a little bit of japanese culture or just japan specific things here and there, and your stunning garnishing skills, the flourishes with which you sometimes prepare ingredients, the expert editing... It's just so elegant and beautiful and it makes me really happy! :) And your cats. Those are the icing on the cake.
This man opened a chocolate bar with a knife
video: "jun's kitchen"  me: *like*
動画が本当に綺麗  凄い
Great video and awesome videos
Jun! Can you make Oyakodon next? I really REALLY want to see how you do it and try it myself!
Wow, now kids that hate rice can get tricked into this!
Cats and Popcorn rice XD
i clenched so hard in fear when he put the chocolate near poky because knowing how much he loves to eat i was scared he'd go for it
We usually make this treat for christmas with puffed rice coated in chocolate inside muffin wrappers. They're really tasty, melts all over your fingers and nice and fluffy from the rice
What a brilliant idea. Man, I love your videos. All of your channels are good. I love your fur babies.
Basically, "How to Make Your Own Crunch Bars", this definitely looks delish and will surely try it soon~!
Is this just regular white rice?
Never knew it was this easy to make puffed rice! Amazing video as always! <3
2:51 holy shitzu dogs. Those knife skills tho
it's that time of year.... to binge junskitchen again
It is crazy how all of June's videos are going trending now. I followed him back when he made cake in a rice cooker.
Was that a public access rice cleaner? Cool!
AWWW Pokey was in this one <3
ラファエルの方がすごい
Katsudon?
Damn, you're amazing.
Your videos are on a whole other level of food porn! I love them.
コーンじゃない件
Okay WOW! AMAZING PRESENTATION AND IT LOOKS SO GOOD!
I had never bothered to think about how rice krispies are made. Today you have taught me something new Jun.
In Australia we call em rice bubbles....and it's a cereal
Japan looking beautiful as always ❤️
U finally posted a video!!! 😄❤️🤤
Such well trained cats. My cat would just take the ingredients and refuse to give it back
It's been awhile
How do you even manage to make puffed rice look fancy, what the heck is your secret?
Poki really got to be in the video this time! Yay! Also I wanna try to make this for some Christmas chocolates now, haha. Except I already want to make too many things.
お花咲いてるみたいで可愛い
UPLOAD MORE YOUR VIDEOS ARE PLEASING TO WATCH OKAY
Me encantan tus videos
猫ちゃんもお料理も素敵です！ これからも頑張ってくださいヽ(´・`)ノ
You even made the chocolates and branches GOSHHHH
Sniff treaters
cats are so elegant tho my dog would gulp down the rice like a baby bird lmaoo
That cat is so good mine would have took off running
I love Poki!!!!
I love your videos, Jun!
I'm scared by hot oil pot, and from hot oiled rice popping out of the pot. Anyone has a solution for make this amazing recipe without hot oil? Thanks
I'll have to try this. I LOVE the audience!
Another amazing cooking video
同じ日本人として誇りに思います
Poki! What a good boy So happy to see poki is behaving himself and has learnt to be calm and patient like Nagi and haku so happy to see all the boys together
The rice in the video looks special and beautiful!
We in America make cereal from this.
ポン菓子！
I cannot tell which one is more beautiful, the cats, Juns himself, his kitchen knife, or the way he took the shots
This is so cool 😎 thanks I’m sharing it on a page o have.
So you're able to use this with any type of rice?
That is so incredibly beautiful.🌷
Puffed rice? Isn't that a bit simple to feature on Jun's kitchen? - my initial thoughts. Leave it up to Jun to take the aesthetics of the dish to the next level 😄 Those puffed rice stalks with the rose chocolates look gorgeous!
じゅんさんが外国の方から「いただきます」を指摘されてて笑いましたw
Great to see this dude back tbh :)
Pooookkkeeeee!!! Also, thanks for your video :)
You know a normal person would rip the wrappers from the chocolate bar with their hands and not a knife. But whatever. Still a great video.
Hey can you do a video of you making aburi salmon please :)
heya nice one... I was wondering what is the optimum moisture content of the rice before popping? and what is the minimum  percentage wise  you could get away with ?
Sounds so good! Will any rice work?
Превосходно! Особенно хороша машина для очистки риса. Япония невероятна.
Poki <3
Rachel is so lucky to have a man like you
Yumm
Bag cat <3
Your videos bring peace to my heart. ❤ from Morocco.
kats
5 seconds into the video and all I have to say is...        Great video!
Everything Jun makes is absolutely stunning....even his own homemade puffed rice is beautifully done and presented.
Meiji CHOCOLATE 🍫
Nice to see Poki in a cooking video with you, Haku and Nagi, he looks so healthy now that he almost looks like a different cat.
Una consulta, se puede con el arroz que compras en un supermercado normal?, porque como veo el arroz que tenia la forma y el color era distinto al que tengo en mi pais
I trap trap trap on the road moving that Corn flakes, rice krispie
I tried made one for myself appearantly it taste different with what brand of chocolate bar you used
Say hi to Jin uncle :D
love it. love your cats, and in my country we eat rice everyday and because of you I love rice more now
I poki wad annoying you while you were making chocolate that wouldve been bad
I am so proud of Poki!
Flying over rice fields is so satisfying~ 💚 And 0:40-0:43 just beautiful~ 💚💚 And Poki, is that you? 😄
love it. love your cats, and in my country we eat rice everyday and because of you I love rice more now
So classy~
His cooking never ceases to amaze me. And the scenery shots are amazing. Also HAKU IS SO GOOD
your videos are so relaxing and fun to watch
Holy heck dude! I've been with you from the start. Your filming has improved so much! I showed this channel to my friend a while back, and now we're both addicted.
The small glimpse of your life you grant us is so beautiful and soothing to watch.  Thank you!
I'm surprised that Poki was being so good! He's almost never in your videos!
😍😍😍😍
Glad to see Poki in the videos!
Another perfect video.  What's better than a Jun's Kitchen video?  Is that Meiji chocolate?  A new Japanese variety store recently opened near me in Toronto and I can get Meiji chocolate there.
I just don't know what else to say..I Love your videos❤
I DIDNT KNOW THIS WAS A THING? i wanna try thus but i bet ill mess up in some way😂
Great video! I had no idea you could pop rice.
POKI!
Yay for Poki!! Looks yummy, but don't let the kitties eat the chocolate, it will hurt them very badly!!
your Japanese "aesthetic" is spot on!!!!
In Indian street foods, puffed rice is used a lot actually in savoury and sweet dishes.
Poki was such a well behaved boy in this video! I love your kitties.
Poki!!! (Also, this video is beautiful, great job, Jun and Rachel!)
Your videos are rather calming
Omg now i know what the fluff in my chocolate bar is
Where are you from?
Poki's finally a star! I'm glad he behaved
so clever
If this is rice how is it pop"corn"?
Omg you've trained poki to be calm !
I think I can speak for all your long term fans, in saying I(we) are so very glad you made another video!  I've already made your Omurice, and Okonomiyaki.  They were really really easy to prepare and make, and yes I have 2 Asian markets nearby.  I absolutely love the fact that Poki is in this one as you prepare the food.  Love your videos and love your cats!  Now you and Rachel should make a get to know Nagi video, since you did one for both Haku and Poki.  But we all love your cooking videos!  From my 4 kitties(Zak, Mick, Yuki, and Sophie) to your three kitties and 2 adults, have a happy holiday season with family and friends!!!
Haha we call the rice bubbles here in Australia :)
Ur cooking videos are so pleasing to watch and ur food looks amazing
The most impressive bit was deep frying the rice on the stem and using it as a garnish. So lovely. Those chocolates look devine!
thank you
Yay! Another video my the magical JunsKitchen ;) happy to be a subscriber 😁
I love this! We are already preparing for Valentine’s day in my Japanese class, so I will definitely make these chocolates for my classmates =^.^=  どうもありがとうございました！
My grandma used to make this and I can't believe I never thought to eat them with chocolate!
簡単だからやってみたい
Finally a video ❤️
I liked seeing Poki!
Hey Jun, I always love seeing that you've uploaded. I am an aspiring baker in America and I would like to thank you for inspiring so many young minds.❤️
I LUV HOW U DO IT homemade
Hey Jun, I hope you tempered your chocolate! :)
毎回最高すぎ
Yay!!! Poki made an appearence! He's so cute, as are the others.
Очень круто, спасибо.
HOUSE EXPOSED.....DONT WORRY I'M ON MY WAY
POKI!! :D
What did that machine do to the rice ?? Clean it ??
Those cats 😊
thank you for all those beautiful videos  i like it all, i have one Question can you tell me where can i buy this gas stove? thayk you
OMG POKI IS IN THE VIDEO! I thought I would never see him in this channel, since he is a naughty cat when it comes to food! Did he learn how to behave? This looks so easy to make, I have nevr heard of Popcorn rice before. I may try to do this at home! Also, the beggining of the video was so relaxing, I loved it - w - I love watching your videos, they are so nice to watch, so relaxing.
2:50 jun the type of guy to cut the rapper with a sharp knife I love it XD
Your channel is very relaxing and i always get hungry :d
I'm glad you don't upload daily,quality over quantity!!
Hey jun? While letting your cats sniff the food have they ever tried eating it?
So cool! Beautiful plating and I didn't even know that it existed!
this is so calming- thank you <3
Jun ur awesome
I love your videos
YES NEW VID
That is beautiful!
finally it been sooo longgggg i miss you and your cats
You are amaZING AT THESE VIDEOS!! YOU are lIke sO good!! YOu need ur own tv show
Your cats are adorable! I can't believe how calm and loving they are. And when you left you cat behind in the bike basket it just stayed there, wow. Amazing. I don't really know how to cook but I like how simple everything is. Maybe I'll try this, I love puffed rice. And I love chocolate! Why not mix them both 😁
love it. love your cats, and in my country we eat rice everyday and because of you I love rice more now

is anyone else shook at how he cut open the chocoate at 2:51
FINALLY a video
I'm always wondering, don't you have lots of cat hair in your food all the time? I have a dog and he doesn't have to be in the kitchen with me, and I still find his fur in my pies, while your cats sit next to you when you cook! (Besides, I think I'll try this out ^^)
my auntie used to make puffed rice  and put it in  sweet Okonomiaki  in Nara with minced nijin and sweeten nori  try it is very delcious but old fashion
Everything you do is aesthetically pleasing! There's an art to that. We have a breakfast cereal here in Australia called 'Rice Bubbles'. It's basically puffed rice too. There's also a malt version called 'Coco Pops'. I'm sure your version is far less processed (or sugar laden!). Thank you for sharing :)
I eating it R NOW
Look at Poki behaving himself!
FINALLY NEW VIDEO!!!!!!
In before trending
Poki doesn’t seem so crazy in these vids.  Do you feed him first?
YOUR VIDEOS ARE MY FAVOURITE THING TO WATCH THEY ARE ART
Is this something you can make with any type of rice? And what was that machine you poured the rice into?
I love your videos so much. They're so relaxing and enjoyable.
Yes I love JunsKitchen!
È vero... in Italiano 🇮🇹 si dice riso SOFFIATO
This looks so good! Great recipes❤️
Is that the equivalent of rice crispies?
ONG Poki!!
Jun’s videos never fail to calm me down 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
*Do a raw sounds of cooking!*
Wait.. is that how they make rice crispies!??
wow thanks i didnt know how you make this 😁😁
I'm surprised Poki was so quiet around food!
These videos are so relaxing
wooow i want to live in your kitchen
I will try this with white and brown rice. Thanks for sharing!
I'm so happy for Poki! He made it in a video! (﹡ˆ﹀ˆ﹡)
EVERYTHING YOU PRESENT IS BEAUTIFUL AF
Do you have any videos of cutting/chopping techniques for quickly cutting vegetables. Like what's the best way to mince an onion?
his videos are so relaxing
why do you have a damascus steel knife?
Aaaaaaahh your food always looks so beautiful and perfect I can’t evennnnn
You and your cats are amazing👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Funfact .. in Germany we have puffed rice chocolate called "Nippon" 😊... As always a interesting cooking video and I am soooooo happy poki made his Jun's Kitchen début ...
Tbh I only watch for the cats
Sry Rachel....I’m falling in love with Jun😍♥️(I swear he came out from a shoujo manga)
woah, poki has debuted! congratulations lil dude, i'm glad that he is considered safe for the kitchen now <3 also!! i had no idea you could pop rice like popcorn, i will definitely have to give it a go
I want Martina and Jun to have a cooking competition I think that would be fun!

This is the BEST channel on youtube. i'd say please make videos daily, but i kinda like that they're sporadic. It's like an amazing surprise every once in a while. I never expect it, which makes it so great every time. Do you know what I mean?
3:05 that piece of chocolate on your finger looked like a toothpick pierced you i was so shocked
make more video please!!! i love your video. <3
What kind of rice did you use
Those flower molds :O
可愛すぎる✨
I don't think any of the people who follow you ever try to make your recipes, or are actually here to learn how to cook. No, we are all here to contemplate art. You can try to reproduce art, but you just don't want to, you just don't need to.
The best popcorn is made of pork skin.
Watching Jun’s kitchen is pretty much therapeutic.
Jun, we can use any time of rice? Will Indian rice work? Since I’m our grocery store, the JP rice is expensive.
I would like to say a huge thank you to JunsKitchen we are from the UK and because of your videos  we are eatting better and healther. My three year loves your videos because of your lovely pet cats. It's always lovely to see people whom show much love and respect for their pets on YouTube. Merry Christmas to you and your partner whos videos we also watch. Many blessings from the UK.
You are alive!!,
Snap, crackle, pop y’know what I’m saying
Me encantan tus videos
If you're melting chocolate and want to to be shiny, add a little bit of paraffin wax. It makes it really pretty and glossy.
You're videos always make me smile and make my day better
look at poki in a video finally!!
I love your uncles farm! It’s so beautiful!
haku <3<3<3
What was the machine that you poured the rice into? What did it do?
Do you know how many times i've wondered if you can do this? Thanks so much for making this vid Also that Kramer/Zwilling Knife is so nice. :O
K lindos os seus gatos!!! 😍😍😍
I just realized at the end that Poki is one of your sniffers! Glad to see he calmed down enough to be part of the fun 😊

Love that rice cleaning? polishing? machine at the beginging.
Poki not eating everything for once
The most aesthetic channel on YouTube !!
Yay I need my cooking shows
Good job, Poki!
Poki is so well behaved now!!!!! I can't believe how much progress he's made!!
Also here in India, we have this thing called 'kurmuras' which are termed puffed rice too. But they look kinda different 😣
So relaxing!!
That is so elegantly displayed! Love your food videos <3
Your videos are so relaxing!
How lovely! We had this when we visited a ryokan just this past fall. I was intrigued as I had never seen popcorn prepared this way.
3:26 so that must be the famous crows I hear in the background! X'D
I want your cats
Hey. What was that machine in the beginning?
Poki is finally in a cooking video and he didn't go crazy! <3
The hot oil was jumping on the poor cat...
So soothing this time.
This is so beautiful and amazing. I had a hard day, and exam season for me is coming up. I just had a cry to let some emotions out and this was so healing :)  Any med students?
Omg Jun it's been forever!!! I always enjoy your videos
poki is now calm enough to be in your videos?! so cute!!!
"hey, i got some rice" *shows gigantic bag of rice*
Your videos are straight up therapeutic.
Have you ever tried to make Swiss food?
I'm glad Poki is learning to behave himself long enough to be in these videos now! 😍
Finally something I can actually try haha
I luv ur videos ur videos make my day
I havent seen fresh picked rice before! Thankyou  for showing that!
Your knife is wonderful
Wow pretty cool, it's rice deep in oil not just a little bit hehehe :)
your videos are always oddly satisfying! thank u jun! and i was pleasantly surprised to see poki behaving in the video heehee
POKI BEHAVED. POKI IN JUNS COOKING VIDEO IS A MIRACLE. POKI GOOD BOY! Thank you for these amazing recipes Jun-san!
simply amazing
Poki watching the rice popping just made my day!
Did your uncle already know about how good Haku is at riding in the bicycle basket? I imagine it’s surprising for the first time to see a cat so peaceful and well-behaved lol.
this looks really pretty!! your cats are jealous
Snap, krackle, pop
So amazing!
This looks tasty
Can you tell us how to tame a cat
How are you so Japanese that you literally eat chocolate with chopsticks XD
What  Well ok that's new
Just love the way you do your videos, so different and creative! Now I can understand better my cat's curiosity. Amazing job! Loved the rice farm... showing where it came from.. so freshly made!
I'm definitely gonna make this! I was just wondering what that machine was that oh poured the rice in? Does it clean the rice for you?
These are so relaxing to watch. Thank you Jun! Keep up the great work and don't stop!
Poki's in a food video! :O
Awww Poki was being good enough to be in a video! Yay! 💗💗💗
Yes! A new video I love your vids :D
Such a BEAUTIFUL knife!
Jun...oh Jun. You're videos always make me want to live in Japan. Such beautiful countryside.
Really like the new intro Jun, i love puffed rice in the morning but ive never really wondered how they do it! Also what was the rice machine? was it like a communal rice polishing machine?
DADDDYYYYYYU
Could you do this with any type of rice? Like white rice bought from the store?
Real talk what is up with that milling(?) machine you used to make white rice?? Do they just have those randomly in Japan or are they only in areas of rice production
Such beautiful hands ;-;
Ok now all I want is that and all covered in chocolate
Your videos always make me so happy. Thank you.
Your foods always look delicious and beautiful
Finely i know how poff rice^^
Always here for the cats
Haku's nose are always so pink!
i love the universal "hold something out to your cat so they can smell it" thing
Poki pok!! So adorable and sweet cant wait to try this recipe when I get home ;D!
U should be a cheff
I think tempering the choco would have made it better
I love these videos. Make a lot more please. 🙃
Лайк за котиков)))
Thank you for this quality content! It' s heart warming!
your life is zen
冒頭の田舎具合が親近感湧きます いいですねー☺️
I'm serious Gordon Ramsay should see this!
I Love your videos !
Who's a better chef Juns kitchen or binging with Babish?
I Love your videos !
ХТО з Украины?
200°C = 392°F
it looks so deliciousヾﾉ≧∀≦)o
*Trending Inbound*
Very nice video!! So glad Poki made it to the video!!!😁
The most satisfying youtube channel
Jun's Kitchen? More like Jun's magical world, consisting of beautiful shots of the scenery and his adorable cats. (and food that looks like it should be served on gold plates).
Poki finally in a video! (Because there's no ingredients that he can steal? Hehe)
what breeds are his cats?
I wonder if you can make this seasoned savory versus chocolate
Oh man! I’m definitely gonna try this out! Will it work with any kind of rice?
Your videos are always worth the wait. And now i really want to try this.
Youre so amazing at cooking!
You are such an artist. Keep up with the great cooking~!
Lovely, calming beautiful video. I love the visit to the rice field. Just a reminder to everyone watching that chocolate is toxic for cats so be sure to not leave any around!!
So peaceful.... My auntie and uncle are moving to Japan. :) Hopefully they see your videos to help them cook :)
jun you have the most bravest kitties my goodnes i know i cant go bike riding with my kitties
everything good also how do you manage to make puffed rice so fancy? lmao A+ 💯
I wonder what the cats thinks this
do you use normal rice?
Poki joined you this time! Did he behave...? Lol
At first I read the channel's name as kitten not kitchen
Poki ate the rice lol
Another video yay! The presentation is so pretty Jun, simple but amazing. Btw your pronunciation is really really good!
웃음소리 너무 좋다
I saw a couple people use おしゃれ to describe this food/channel, apparently it means fashionable?? I wondered if it means the fancy way you display the food or is it just that the foods are unique? I'm curious
very intresting how you processing the rice and put it in a rice washing machine - is it common you got rice laundries ?  = and what does it say on these buttons ?
How hipster are you? Do you farm and clean your own rice? Get on Jun’s level
Who is this new cat and what have you done with poki???
I’d listen to someone chopping chocolate all day if I could
This videos are so therapeutic
What was the machine you put the rice into
Your cats just make your video more perfect
1:10 wait, is this like a public rice processing machine?
Of all the videos for Poki to make a calm debut in, it's in front of a pot of dangerously hot oil  It fits his personality somehow! XD
Jun your videos are always so wonderful and really quite calming to watch! I also want to compliment you on how you present the food you make after it's done, it's always very pleasing to the eye. I love your cats! And the channel you and Rachel have. Just love it all really, keep up your good work.
He turns something simple into something very amazing 😻
never dissappointing! it looks really delicious thooo.
i was having a bad day and this video made me happy. thank you jun!💕 much love for ur cats💖
You rarely post but when you do, your video makes trending every time. Great Job 👍
Ahhhhh I love your videos so much. 🌾💜
What city is this? I want to visit it, even for a day trip.
Can you do this with any rice?
毎回思うけど、上からの視点ってどうやって撮ってるの？
the caaaare for the detail
At first I was why is this loading slower than it's used to, then I realized how good it looked and i realized it was on 4k XD
They have public rice processors near where this dude lives that crazy
Quality content man!!!
this is art at its finest
Now I know the secret formula to success!
I’ve missed these videos sm
I'm so glad that Poki made it into a Jun's Kitchen video! <3
what was that machine that he put the rice through?
Aestethic as hell❤️
your cat is so well trained! If I took my cat to a rice field he’d be gone for good 😂
Hello poki 😆
damascus steel
Jun updated!!!❤️❤️
Poki is being such a good boy! I never expected him to be able to sit around and not whine while you were cooking.
Alah jebul gur gogek dikei coklat...
*R I C E   C R I S P I E   I N T E N S I F I E S*
omg! poki finally makes an entrance!!
Poki finally made the vid!!
НОВОЕ КУЛИНАРНОЕ ВИДЕО ОТ ДЖУНА СПАСИБО СПАСИБО  все очень круто
in indonesia you can call this Renginang  or in javanese it calls Cengkaruk. Cengkaruk is another name of pop rice. :) happy watching.. oh dear i hope Yogyakarta will save. it's a big earthquake bit here.
Rice krispies
how lucky to have such a nice uncle!, fresh harvested rice (sorry english is not my first language) I love how much detail and thought goes into your cooking videos, it is well worth the wait!
FINALLY 😭❤ these videos make my day
GD3にターボ付けようか悩んでます。どうしたらいいですか？
So nice ❤
Your videos are so ridiculously well-made and you're just amazing.
:"( this is so beautiful i'm gonna cry
that rice processing machine looked fun to use
Poki!!!
Where you live is so beautiful! I like the peaceful appearance of the outdoors there. Thank you for sharing this.
looks delicious! :D
I'm so hungry right now! The cuteness of the cats are above all. Great job for Poki.
YOUR FOOD LOOKS AMAZING. It looks delicious. Artistic. Love it!
I was gonna advice you not to let cats alone but at the end of the video there was a guy with your cat.
That knife look like some legendary item drop from raid boss
Oh wait, is puffed rice also called rice crispies?? 0.0  If so, I thought rice crispy was made with some kind of magic.-. Not just... deep fried rice 0.0 //mind-blown😂😂//
When the one on the stalk started to fry, it looked so pretty :D Like blooming flowers!
Dude, you have GOT to post more often. This stuff is simply amazing.
Puffed Rice, almost a daily snack in India...as an ingredient or just whole.
Poki is there!!! <3
looks like rice krispies :D
I'm here for the cats
I love stuff you make and show and I love your cats I love orange and white cats :)
His videos are so good, I hope he doesn't get pressured in to rushing them and make them bad.
一つの動画レベルが違う
Jun you create art with the simplest of things.  That is some serious artistic talent.
Jun : Is it fun ? Me : Yah it is fun getting burned by hot oil
Does this work with long grain rice?
skin: clear mind: calmed heart: soft   I always look forward to new videos, they're the purest form of therapy to me. They're so relaxing, and they really do brighten my day.   I want to try and make puffed rice now 😌
this is a really great lif i love it so mutch . how can i forked this
I literally was just about to look up how to make popped rice in google because a friend of mine made it earlier, when this came up in my recommendations. Freaky.
like
great video!
Gayyyy
Didnt know you could pop rice like that.
your videos have such a peaceful tone, it is very inspiring.
Will it work with jasmine rice?
Can you do this with any kind of rice (jasmine rice, basmati rice, etc.), or only with Japanese short grain rice?
Poki is behaving nice
Didn’t know that was possible
Great content please keep it up
stopped porn to watch this deliciousness!
hey pokey actualy is in this video is he slowly learning not to steal ingredents?
how does a video like this get dislikes it doesn't make any sense  🤔
Lit
An amazing video again <3
Is it okay if the type of rice different from what you are using?
ohh that's so fun! any savory recipes with pop rice?
I didn’t know I could love someone else’s cats so much... yet here I am 😂😻💗
Ahhh, finally. Something I can make. (I tried making a crepe suzette and nearly burned down my kitchen. lol.)  lovely video, as always!!
Jun you should take picture of your dishes and tag Gordon ramsay on twitter. Curious what his comment would be.
This seem like a lovely, light treat but where to find cultivated rice (I'm not sure what that machine did but I feel we may not have that) in the 4th largest city in the States😩😩
A R T
Poki is finally quiet enough for a video!!!
whenever you cook it's just so....clean.
You are the real living Shokugeki no Souma character!!
OK, you've got to make a video about that rice whitening machine on your channel with Rachel. Are they common? Does it cost money to use? What does it do, exactly? What are all the buttons for? Do you find them in the cities as well? How are they kept clean? I have so many questions!
When I saw the rose shape pop out from the chocolate mold I was thinking how sweet it was that you were making this and going to give it to Rachel!  and then you ate it hahaha
We have a Candy store here in the U.S. Called Sarris' Candies. They make chocolate covered popcorn. Its amazing. It's non-buttered and unsalted popcorn.
I love your videos Jun!, they are bliss... Also I 💜💜💜 Poki!!!!!!, he behaved well in this video 😋
I'm in love with you're cat and I'm amazed at how much he/she loves you, it doesn't even try to run away from you ❤️❤️
It's so cute how your cats like to watch you cook. Cute fluff balls, just like my cat.
That is litterally the most well behaved cat ever lol😂
This recipe looks fun! also congrats on getting poki in one of these!
튀밥..?
Hi , your videos are so cool I love your cats Thanks for sharing . always enjoy watching :)
Beautiful art cooking... I wish I had a husband like you 😀
チョコを切っていた包丁欲しいのですが、メーカーと品名を教えて頂きたい。
Poki was being so polite! ☺️
Poki's becoming more disciplined!!
The day that I found this channel was one of the greatest things ever. Every video makes me feel good and relaxed away from my crazy life. Keep it up Jun!
きたーっ！どっかの仮面野郎とはまるで違いますね！ 狙わずにこのおしゃれさ、尊敬します
Poki's in the video!!!!
Where exactly does Jun live . It seems so unreal . There is a wide expanse of lush green land and a big city across a body of water
this is so cool and your cat's are the best
lol i thought poki was going to eat the rice but nope
Thank you Jun. that looks so good!!
Yay cats <3
When did Poki become so calm? I love that all three of the cats can be in the video now! They're so cute!
flat earth
美味しそう😻  餅米をそのまま揚げて雛あられを作った事有りますが、お米を揚げても同じ感じになるんですね😸　 挑戦してみます(笑) 良いレシピありがとうございます🎵
does this work with any type of rice? even with the one we buy already in a packet in the market?
Have you ever crashed your bike with haku on it?
It looks so good
haku 😍😍😍😍
Yay poki was in a vid
Why are you so cool?
You're so lucky to live in such a beautiful place. Its literally my dream to live in a place with grass and trees. Where i'm from is only desert.
Your videos are soooo amazing, beautiful and satisfying💕 it is so enjoyable to watch your videos and glad to see you update new videos I feel so hungry when I am watching this at midnight🤤
Was impressed how calm poki was about you putting food in front of his face.
Your videos are such a blessing.
This is just art
It's been so long😭--we missed you!
how come your cats are so calm, mine would just eat the damn thing straight away let alone smelling it.
Damn that outro so damn cute! xux
Popcorn rice looks nice but isnt it the same as mannas but without the colored sugar
1 word "WOW"
so... when will you show us how to do donas
I absolutely love your biking scenes,  it goes so well with the music and Haku makes it even better! Thanks for making these amazing videos.
food looks good but I'm confused why you're treating your cat like a child, he's a cat; have a an actual child if you want to be a parent
wow amaizing when the rice was clean, it were shigning like diamonds, really beautiful. Coongrats to you and your family for the nice and great work. They are feeding the people with it, its amaizing. MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR FOR ALL.
Clicked on the video because it was a cat in the thumbnail
Japan looks lo peaceful ^_^ It's so green, you can bike pretty much anywhere, people are polite, etc. I'd like to go someday!
Ah, Poki is being good!  Not messing with your ingredients during filming.  Ya!
This video is really relaxing.
I love puff rice with chocolate, but Jun took it to another level! 😱👌🏼😄❤️  #Junsensei
Yaay
Ayyyy
ラファエルに真似されてるけどどう思いますか？笑
question... may i know what does the machine do to the rice when jun put them in it?
Quality content
Isashiburi!
Poki's finally allowed at the table omg!
Pokiiiiii! 😻
Amazing as always Jun! I wish I could have your talent in my kitchen!
ポン菓子との違いは何？
hello
Grandioso... Felicidades... Me encanto bellas ternura.
So.... Rice Krispies?
love the clips when you are outside with your cat. So peaceful!
Jun never fail to impress me
Can I use with different rice?
This time poki can be in the video cause there's only rice as the ingredient 😂😂😂
These videos are such high quality. So much work has been put in them.
The real Yukihira Soma
I love your relationship with your cats, i wish i’d had the same with mine, i think you should make more videos about cat training :)
Who cares?
Plz plz plz release more video, I love your cat and your channel so so muchhh
Popped rice. You learn something new everyday
This looks so fun and easy, it'd be a good gift to some of my family!
Finally! So happy your uploaded (:
Poki is actually calm enough & quiet enough to co-star! wow! Was that machine some sort of winnowing device or was it blanching the rice or cleaning it or what?
2:55 Jun, you use the knife with so much confidence and skill. The sound of the knife is so sexy.
My maid loves to make these whenever we have leftover rice but she dries them first before frying it and they taste really good just with some salt 😋
just wondering but how many cats do you have?
Sadly i can't get that fresh of rice.... Can you use store bought rice? If so what kind?
Glad to see Poki in a cooking video
This channel is so aesthetically pleasing! 💕
なんか何も考えずに見れるなぁ〜笑
Was that a rice cleaning machine? ಠ_ಠ
Poki is finally well behaved enough to be in a video I'm so happy 😂
3:46 - Okay, he takes out the chocolate and arranges them 3:55 - He puts the rice crisps beside it in a bowl  4:00 - And then puts those weird stalk thingy... 4:04 - Wtf how did it become a work of art in the span of 4 seconds?
FINALLY
Aww I see Poki! (is that how it’s spelled)
It's somewhat very satisfying to see you cook. I really enjoy watching your videos, please upload more often. :D
I bet it tastes great :)
Simply Amazing
The cats just sit there like *Can i get sum?*
he camera angle is perfect its always the perfect spot to film its like a film
You made a Crunch bar! One of my favorite kind of chocolate bars. I'd love to try this but here in America, in a city, not sure if I could come across raw rice.
Your cats are very cutes ^    ^ (*-*)
Your videos never disappoint 👌🏼😊
Your cats are so well-behaved and adorable 💕
When I saw your uncle (It was him, rigth?) petting your cat at the end, I just knew he was going to tickle it in the ear. I was not wrong.
Now that I think about it, isn't that the same as a Crunch bar?
Love the chocolate and of course loveeeee ur cat! #catlover
damn cool country with such a beautiful city.....  what city is that mate?? worth to visit i think
So pretty 😍
ポン菓子
I was surprised to see Poki there, lol! XD
久しぶり！嬉しすぎ！！！！
Poki 😍
He should enter a cooking contest
What was the machine he put the rice through at 01:00?
Literal rice krispies 😂😂😂
Your videos make my day and bring a smile to everyone in my house. Thank you and Namaste.
まってましたー！！
someone should really make a compilation video of all the cat bike rides, they're my favorite part of the videos
ラファエルが真似してますよ笑
In indonesia, we call it rengginang, especially in surabaya city
I haven't even watch yet but just gonna leave a like
Jun: Slices into chocolate wrapper with fancy azz knife. Me: Bites into chocolate bar, probably with bits of wrapper stuck in my teeth.
*falls from chair* Poki is actually behaving?
Ok I love chocolate, I've all different kinds from different countries and the Meiji brand chocolate (what he used) is some of the best chocolate I have ever tasted.
I see Jun upload i press like. Don't even need to watch the video, you already know it's gonna be good.
be sure to check your bikes brake cables, take it from me if your gear cable looks like that you have strong chance your brakes cables look like that.
Haku has got to be the calmest cat I've ever seen.
That presentation  my god. unbelievablly amazing.
ALL 3 CATS IN ONE VIDEO?? this ain't good for my heart
Looks so good! I wish I were one of your cats, must get amazing food
Your videos are extremely satisfying to watch
Jun, this is so simple and easy to make 😄 watching your videos back to back and must admit that I find them extremely soothing n relaxing... So adorable cats 😍😍😍 Poki has really been a good boy 😘 How come??? Any bloopers 😋
YAAAAAAY!!! A NEW VIDEO
You have an amazing life,when i grow up,i want to be like you!
Request: Fried Rice
In the states we have a lot of popular brands of cereal and snacks with this type of rice I never thought of making it. Awesome video we will have to try it!😊
You make something so simple look extraordinary!
Thank you for making these amazing videos!!!
Bruh just made the fanciest looking Rice Krispies ever #respect
Nice
If you like food and cat, this is purrfect channel for you
is it normal for japanese to plant rice in their backyard or is the drone shot of a special area?
Japan is good
Is this the same as rice crispies, the cereal? Also Jun is so extra with the knife 😂
先赞再看
Ooooo, I'm gonna melt chocolate like that to make chocolate covered almonds mmmm
Ya know what’s awesome? For years now I’ve been watching Jun’s kitchen but lately I see more and more of his videos showing up on my Tumblr dash and that makes me so happy. I’m so glad Jun’s channel is blowing up.
Really appreciate it very cool and simple
Yey Poki!
I think it's also the first time seeing poki in your video not screaming and demanding for food. Haku and nagi are a great influence to poki now since he is so calm
Jun cooking with haku = an automatic like 😉
When I hear "Kohaku" I immediately think of InuYasha, anyone else? :D Please someone say YES! :D hah :)
i see your clip every day <3
what gas cooker is that?
POPCORN RICE!?!?!? ..... .... .... .... .... .... *amazing*
Jun is soma from foodwars
仮面かぶってる人にパクられてますよ
Is it just me or that rice looks different from the rice we get in stores? (The grain itself, obviously not talking about the puffed rice)
Your videos heal my soul
Poki 😄
Is it just me but Jun's accent is a bit more American and more pronounced than usual?
Artful cooking!😀💖
My favorite channel,  thank you so much for sharing your videos.  I love your cats 😻😻
I'm so proud of Pokie for being chill.
That's a beautiful knife.
I should totally make this for breakfast! Thanks Jun
Poki is behaving!
Let's get this on trending again!
nice!! cool food presentation techniques；)
So good to see Poki in the kitchen! Must’ve taken a while for him to get used to all the food xD
Soooooo cool!
Lovely video as always Jun! Poki even seemed... well behaved!? 😆
Now I learn new things, didn't know you can do something like that with rice
Beautifully filmed, composed and narrated.  Love how sensitive you are with your cats.
We have rice puffs too in Indonesia. We even have the machine for it. All the rice puff will be gathered in a square mold and showered with light sugar syrup, let it harden. Cut them in cubes, and voila~~~ ready to serve.
The opening reminds me of the intro in Pokemon
This channel is so pure 😭 Thank you Jun!
Loved it!! I was wondering if one day you could prepare a typical full Japanese meal! Like what is a usual breakfast, lunch and diner in Japan!!!:-D
the best cook on youtube, and you have really beautiful cats.
オシャレじゃないかも知れませんが、子供の頃良く食べた、ニンジンの袋に入ったポン菓子食べたくなりました( ˊᵕˋ ) いつも気分も晴れやかになるような動画をありがとうございます(*･ω･)*_ _)ﾍﾟｺﾘ
Anytime I see Nagi, my heart flutters~
Yaay! Poki's finally made his debut appearance in a JunsKitchen video! I'm amazed at how the rice puffed but continued to stay on the stalk 😁 This is such a sweet looking dish.
I watch cuz of your cats =^.^=   Well, and the food 😸
Japan is full of perfection and art
20+ years of eating rice every day, and I never knew it can be popped like so. Thank you!
Cute you cat
Beauty
久々の投稿！ いつ出るかワクワクしてました！笑笑
Looks great and all, but all I can think is "wow, only 2 pieces of chocolate?"
this is the first time i heard about puff rice? or atleast thats what i know.  And omahgawd! a voiceover!
油炸的爆米香😄
good job with the cooking you'r the best cooker good job!
Chocolate??? Well.. Chocolates Are Dangerous for cats and kitty's. One time i had a kitten and i gave her a chocolate but... she died.. ( REST IN PEACE ) :(
This is awesome!  My girlfriend and I are going to try this tonight.  Thanks for the idea!
wow looks yummy must try😊
These are the best cooking videos on YT. Please do 1 each day. :-)
now poki join to the club haha nice one jun
I see our Poki being a good boy here ☺️☺️
Do you need a certain kind of rice for th is
now im hungry for popped rice and melted chocolate af
Now I'm craving a crunch bar looks prettier on the plate ♥️
Yay Jun, another video! I truly love your videos and I'm so excited every time you do another one.
I really want to try this! Simple but yummy delicious. It's always so nice to see Haku on adventures, wish I could like this video more than once!! :3
Reason I watch Jun's videos : 10% aesthetics 10% cooking 80% cats 😂😂
As always, like a piece of art
Ahh Missed your videos so much 💜 and  I love the drone footage upgrade 😆
Wtg Poki! 😍💗
As always, a piece of ART...
Wow. These videos are amazing and so soothing. I can tell how much work you put into these videos. You deserve 10 mil subs!
Ahh yeah I love puffed rice snacks! This looks so tasty :)
I was like where is Jun I'm so hungry I need to learn a new dish
This channel is insanely good, goddamn.
always enjoy watching your video keep it coming please :)
Any kind of rice will do?
interesting I didn't know rice could do that like popcorn puff Rice? not sure if they have that here in the States like the chocolate made to look like flowers I couldn't do that
ehhh POPPING oil everywhere, doesn't it hurt lol?
As always, another beautiful work of art! You make it look so easy. The popped rice on the stalk was so pretty! You really should have your own cooking show. Now I’m off to attempt popped rice...and hopefully not burn the house down.
LOL, Poki "Ou, what is happening in the pot today? Wait, what's that?! Eh, I don't know if I should be this close." xD It looks amazing! Both the presentation and the rice/chocolates themselves. If I could cook without burning everything I touch (and had the proper equipment) I'd try it. Instead, I'll just live vicariously through your cooking ^^;
Again, what a beautiful beautiful video, guys :)) Very well done! I kept wondering: that machine Jun used to clean (?) the rice, is that just an open station anyone can use?
I'm amaze poki is now qualified enough to be in a video XD bet you had a tough time though😁😁 i luv ur videos jun!
hey it's poki 😄
I really do hope you open a restaurant or a cafe one day.. imagine having lunch in Junskitchen that would be amazing! Always love these videos even though I don't even cook!
Jun, could you spray it with cooking oil and pop it in a micro wave ?
冒頭のシーンはドローンを使っているのですか？  すごーく素敵な風景ですね
Your videos are amazing! Looks complicated and yet so simple and delicious! Love these videos. Very calm and satisfying to watch and hear!
What was the large metal sieve you place the rice in at the store?
Be grateful you have a good life
Haku is such a good cat :)  About the pop rice, are you forced to fry the rice or you can also just use an empty hot pan ?
So beautiful
Poki finally gets to shine
Jun, this footage is amazing!! Love all the detail shots. 💖
お米揚げてはじけたお米を 目で追う猫ちゃん 可愛い 癒された（╹◡╹）
Amazing production value!! Please make a video in which you actually feed the cats something. I feel bad for them just smelling this amazing food you make lol
I can't believe your cat just stayed in the open basket while you went and got rice :o
久しぶり！
お米でポップコーンって作れるんだ〜それにしても猫たちかわいい
Masterchef material ✨🤘
Poki is no longer jumping on everything!
Looks amazing. Now I miss Japanese rice in my hometown...
But wouldn't it be just Poprice?
Chocolate cuting is not possible for all knife.
It would have been such a mess if I would have done this 😂
yahoo
I never knew that you could make homemade puffed rice! I want to try this too! 😄
My wife and I have taken inspiration from your videos - We like to give our cat an opportunity to see and smell ingredients, either as soon as we bring them home, or as we are cooking.  We even set up a chair in the kitchen for him to sit on.  He doesn't have the best view but I think he feels more engaged with us.
4:19 suddenly Poki
Is that a weed plant in your kitchen
Thank you for showing this.  Does it matter what type of rice (short, long, fresh, older) you use?
Yay Poki is in the cooking videos now!
I've never had fresh rice. I bet it tastes so much better!
Very good video.
You are such an artist Jun!
Are u live on japan?
I think I can actually do this one LOL
Looks very nice Well done Jun 👍
It's channels like this one that make me click on the notification bell 👌 Keep up your great work Jun!!
Can I using grape seed oil? I've hear that corolla oil may not be health when used as fried oil.
Jun's making perfection
OMG THIS LOOKS SO DELICIOUS I WANNA TRY IT RIGHT AWAY (* ﾟДﾟ) Your videos are always so beautiful and calm, it blesses my eyes and my ears everytime (T▽T) Thanks Jun!
this is not cooking, this is art..
amazing as always, i dont even cook but your meals look delicious and your cats are really cute.
Amazing!!!
Those cats reflect your attitude. So good to watch your videos ..very relaxing
awww look at poki being a good boy and finally joining his brothers to watch jun cook! thats so cute~
お米を揚げるなんて斬新。 ポン菓子作るのかと思った
That machine....it's like a Coinstar for rice :O
this was so satisfying to watch. also the neighborhood you live in is so dreamy. I'm so living in an area like yours when i grow up. You did a perfect job and your cats are adorable. seriously you're the best you tuber ever in my opinion.
:^0
I never thought I'd see the day that someone managed to make Rice Krispies fancy.
beautiful video my friend
*CAME* *HERE* *FOR* *THE* *CAT*
Nice to see Poki, so glad that he is learning to behave for your cooking videos. :)
WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELDS
Anyone watched this just for the cats?
Kohaku is as calm as always.
Does this works on any other rice or just Japanese rice?
In the UK our major brand of 'popcorn rice' is called Rice Krispies!
I don't know if anyone else will relate, but where I am  (USA) we have little chocolate coals that are like what Jun made. Still really fun to see how to make my own though! Love the content and the cats :)
It looks like rice krispies
日本の良いところを動画にしてくれて本当に嬉しい
I want to try this but.....i have different rice!
Yay! Another video! （＾ω＾） (P.S how did you even get those shots from the sky? Using a drone? Or something else?)
My favorite things in one video:  Food and cats.
Literally amazing
I love watching Jun cook it's so relaxing! The way he handles knives🔪🔪 is amazing. I wish for half his skill in the kitchen. 🐈🌾
お米とチョコレートだけであっさりラファエルを超えるクオリティ。 いや、比べるとジュンに失礼か。笑
Yeah poki in the video!
The cats are like "What the hell? Gimme me some!"
Is this your field?
0:59 Jun what is that place? And are they common in Japan?   In Nepal we have a person operating those machines in places like that.
i need more it was so short😭😭
This might be a weird comment; but my cat actually likes to watch your videos on my phone. He lays down on the couch, i put the phone in front of him and he keeps watching 😂😂 my cat literally binge watches you
Wow Fabulous !
You've done it again. Beautiful plating.
My mouth always waters at the sight of your beautiful food.
Wow! I never knew it was that easy thanks! Just one thing, can you do that with any type of rice? Is there any preferable ones? Also where did you find that machine that unhulled (if that's how you say it) your rice? Btw your content is awesome, cats and good cooking what else can I ask for Greetings from Australia :)
Cool recipe
I never seen that black cat
Omg, POKI IS AT THE BIG BOY TABLE😂😂😂
Yayyyyyy wating for this videoooo
I’m so proud of Poki! That kitty has come a long way. I feel like a proud auntie 😂
Poki’s being a good boy!
うへ〜〜うまそう
ابداع منك يا سيد     I am creative from you, sir
Where is that place? it is very beautiful
so aesthetically pleasing!
You wrecked the video by putting Poki in it.  Leave Poki OUT!  Just knew you were going to end up putting him in.  Too Bad.  If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it… LEAVE POKI OUT!!!
Love your videos so so sooo much haha
ひさびさ！
I have waited so long for a new video I feel blessed
haku teh beauty
WhatILivefor.mp4
I let my cat snif what I eat ever since I watched your videos, now my cat climbs on my shoulders to see me cook and have a whiff of what it is.
So cool!
こんな風にできるの初めて知った 市販のお米でもできますか？
So happy that Poki is able to be in  the cooking videos now. Good job Poki!
簡単でめっちゃ美味そう 時間あったら作ってみよう
WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELD MADAFAKAAAA
Whenever I let my cat to Smell the food I eat, she just licks it. :)
Hello dude make more videos with your cats :3
Popcorn rice       Whaaaat???
I had no idea puffed rice was this simple to make??? This is giving me Ideas. Also, I'm never gonna be over Haku chilling in the basket of a bike, riding through rural Japan. That's something straight out of a Ghibli movie. :')
It look so easy to do when you do it hehe
This is really cool ! And tasty too
いい田舎にすんでるな～ 精米機なつかし
Rice Krispies! Finally, something Poki doesn't want to eat.
your cat remind me of my late cat
Yaayyyy poki
Poki's finally good enough to be in videos! I'm so proud
the cats😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍😭😍
Kellogg's Rice Krispies!!
there's a trick for the chocolate to be extra shiny and look like the chocolates in the store (I'm Belgian so you should trust me lol) 1. melt the chocolate until it reaches 50-55 °C 2. take it off the hot water and stir until it cools down to 27-28 °C 3. finally put it back in the hot water until it reaches 30-32 °C  ps: you have the most beautiful cats
I need more Jun'sKitchen in my daily life! Your videos are always beautiful, artistic, and soothing. I love seeing your cooking, not to mention your adorable cats!
How in the heck do you manage to make everything you do in the kitchen look so pretty!?
最後の稲の状態で揚げたのを飾りにしてるところがまたジュンさんシャレてんなぁって思わせるところだなぁ…😅 美味しそうとは思わないけど、綺麗だなって思いました笑
I swear, those cats are super patient! Even after sniffing each item, they're not tempted to lick/bite! Trained so well! Its almost as if they know they'll get fed something special if they behave nice! Wow!
your kitchen knife is beautiful. Where can I buy it?
Thx
Jun, please do a high quality bento from anime 🙏🙏🙏
can u teach us how to make miso soup?
絶対イケメン

Can we see another cat safe recipe?
This channel is everythng iv always wanted.
I miss Asia. I've only been to Thailand and Cambodia. I really miss the meats on a stick and the duck hanging the window. Will you make some Khao Soi for us? Do you Thai?
jun are real life souma..
This video is very cute.❤
Where do you live? I saw Tokaido Sinkansen in your vid once.
Please post more videos!
that is so cool
So... Do you have "Master Chef" in Japan? 'Cause you should totally go.
Is it a must to use japaneese rice only or any rice will work?
That rice mill was awesome. I've never seen one like it.
Yeeey a new video 🎉. This is like therapy for me. Thank you 😊 💛
Look at Poki being good!
It's saying you have 19K9K8K3K17K14K likes for this video.  Probably bugged youtube UI, but it deserves double that!
So relaxing
1:25 is he talking to me or the cats? I can't tell...
I actually giggled a little bit when I saw that Poki was actually in the video this time :3 He's being such a good kitty and not stealing anything <3
In Taiwan we have pop rice too but it call爆米香 the different part is in Taiwan we will put some  maltose in it and you can buy it in the market
cOpIeD yUn'S kItChEn!!1!1
👍👍👍
I want your life
Love the knife. It looks gorgeous. And this is an amazing video! I always wanted to know how to make puffed rice.
i really wanna try this now!
Kinda like homemade rice crispies!
I was just watching the rice videos on your other channels!
poki...give me more poki video......T.T
New video from Jun...hurries, gets coffee, and takes it in. Your videos are so mesmerizing and beautiful. I also learn a thing or two. It's nice to see Poki being a good boy.
It's so simple yet u made it so amazingly 👌👏
i want his life
The rice you are popping on the stem is so beautiful.  It reminds me of cherry blossoms, and it also reminds me of cotton blooming, which I see in my area. Can loose rice be prepared in an air popper?   Thank you for your delightful videos.  You make everything look very easy and fun.
As alwasy cat magnet for me
can he marry me
@1:58 **jun puts rice into oil** poki: ㅍㅅㅍ **rice starts puffing and smoking** poki: ㅇㅅㅇ so cute, also i'm so happy that we finally see him included in the video now :D
音楽とカメラワークが気持ちいいですねー。
This is the COOLEST video Jun!!! I cant wait to try this! 😍😍😍
Hello! Can we do this with other types of rice, such as long-grain or basmati rice?
2:30 우와 너무 예뻐요!
Those Popcorns look tasty and those Chocolate Flowers look beautiful! *JunGasm* I like it.
oh sweet thought I was gonna wait 10 years for this
You are just amazing and your cats are soo adorable
welcome to the ricefields
Does it have to be canola oil?
Its December, isn't it suppose to be winter? I confuse...
Glad you make another vid, keep it up~! XD  Now 3 cats, they were so adorable~
I💝 ur videos
Jun please hire a team to help you make more videos more often!
It was very nice to see the rice in the field and all the processes that you had to make to get the final result. Good job to you and to your "feline helpers" :)☺
What aboutu hot mirku?
Awesome
I love how he shows the food to the catto before eat it
え、こんなオシャレなことある？笑
Beautiful, extraordinary cinematography Jun. You're a true artistic creator.
YES
what a beautiful video. thank you from san Francisco.
自分が知ってる中で日本人で一番オシャレなクッキングチャンネル
that looks so good  yum  :3
No Itadakimasu this time Jun?! :(
Yay Poki!
じゅんさんが明治の板チョコを使ってるところに謎の安心感と親近感を覚えたw
Do we need to use canola oil or can we use any regular oil instead?
Poki didnt try to eat everything in front of him. Wow!....poki are you ok buddy!
Yummy! I would love to try it some day.
I'm so proud of Poki for chilling out and watching you cook without getting in the way or stealing anything! He's come so far!
Every movie is great and great again! ;-) Thx and best Greetings from Germany!
Eh heeyyy~~ Poki finally behaves! XD Or well at the very least the pop rice doesn't satisfy his palette lolz. He's like, Gordon Ramsay level. When the good food is not teh gud fud
rice crispies
What type of rice do you need for this?
Omg Pokiiiii 😭😭❤️
2:18 wouldnt your entire floor be splattered with oil? and oil is so tough to clean
ドローンを使っての映像が良いですね〜
おっしゃれやなぁ笑
Nice to see all the kitties in the video!  But I was wondering what the machine was that you put the rice into at the beginning and what it does?  Love your cooking videos!
Don’t mind me, I’m just here for the quality content. 🍿🍚🎬
smooth
hmm.. soo japanese rice is more round than rice in here, indonesia
2:50 that packet had no chance
I love your video . what a lovely cat .
If you are looking for something different, i would be happy if you try to make „Schweinebraten mit Klößen“. Its a german national dish i really like and since now its wintertime, its perfect for the season. If you don’t find all the ingredients, why don’t you make your own adaptation of it.   Also i‘d like to say how much i enjoy watching your videos. Keep up the great work!
god this is so satisfying to watch!!
Yay you uploaded again! Poki is being such a good boy ❤
Haku just always looks like such a chill cat
you got a drone?!! ayeeee
i was in love with Jun's chef knife............. until i saw the price O_O
Another amazing video 😊
I’m already sad that I finished watching this video and have to wait so long for your next one. Please upload more.
Can I use any rice?
Poki's finally allowed in the kitchen during the videos! Yay, congrats, Poki!!
米香？
Love your vids... but isn’t chocolate dangerous for cats... just be careful
LOVE you. God Bless
... needed ice cold milk and a little sugar to serve mmm
おいしそう
Your videos are always so calming to watch
this was LEGENDARY to watch love it
Thank You for this interesting journey.     :)) In Poland, I did not see such a cultivated field. Nor a machine for cleansing rice. It is very interesting. I feel like a cat in Your basket. Would cats lick chocolate or not ...? I would lick. Very interestingly given twig! I see for the first time that the twig in hot oil... blooms in white !    :))
The cinematography and editing are way too good. How the hell do you guys do this?
Yay!! New video!!! Your videos relax me and I find them comforting
Hi Jun you have access to raw unprocessed rice have you ever thought about making your own sake before it would make a very interesting vid if you did i have made baijiu  before but never a Japanese style sake
Khajits great at food quality control its too cute
Wow! Poki was behaved. Good job!
Hey juns can i know what your gas stove brand  name is?
2:30 Mind... Blown... You sir, are an artist.
Hold up! Is that a damascus knife???! That is so cool!!
That like rengginang from my country
Christmas has come early
your wife probably alreadu told you but in america we eat this as cereal and its so good
This might taste good with milk and honey
バレンタインデーにこれを作ろうかしら…
Such a peaceful life
I always love your videos Jun. Thank you very much!!! Please give the kitties a good scratching for me!
wondering if Haku controlled the cam to get that back shot lol
That remembers me my great grandfather
Every single one of your videos is like... a piece of art.
Why the intro music sound like Post Malone’s “Congratulations”
ポン菓子とはまた別のもの？
2 words: food terrorism...
Guys, those with the links are fake accounts of JunsKitchen!!! Don't click on the link!!! Anyways, the puffed rice looks so good and it's cool that your uncle has a rice farm(?).
やっぱり見せ方がおしゃれやな〜。 芸術作品みたい
Yey finally Video <3
Yuh
He used chopsticks to eat chocolate. Kind of weird😅
you know it's gonna be a good day when Jun uploads a new video
great idea for christmas. Thanks jun ^_^
so. .... cinamatic. ... I. cant.. take. it..
Really enjoyed seeing the rice harvesting and milling process as well as the cooking, thank you!
Thanks For sharing.👍
I'll see you guys on the trending tab
Hii  I really loved your videos... Amazing... From India...
that intro was like Stardew Valley irl
ラファエル動画パクってますよ
ポン菓子美味しい
ポン菓子見たいな？
Yes! BRILLIANT, excited to try this. Loved seeing Poki in this one too.
1:00 What did that machine do to the rice at the beginning?
I enjoy your channel  and cool cats
That's beautiful, Jun!😍
Finally Poki first appearance in juns kitchen!! So happy 😭😭😭
this is the earliest i’ve ever been to one of your videos!! love your content x
What a perfect life..
ジュンさん...本当にすごいです! 心から尊敬してます...!
Whoa cool
A video yeay 😆😆
eating chocolate with chopsticks. you dont get a lot more japanese than that
what is the song called pls
更新待ってました!!(∩´∀`∩)
Jun could you please try to make a replica for the american snack "Rice Krispie treats?". Can't find them here in Japan.  I'm guessing its just pop rice with marshmallow
Watch out for spam comments everyone
Such a beautiful video, everytime
後片付け大変そう
2:34 magical moment 😍
Like my comment if you are here before it goes viral!!!
Poki can finally be in a cooking video 😍
Man that's just some Popcorn Rice Chocolate and you make it look like some 5 Star Gourmet Food hahahaha Gj on the Video man! Always love to see new Vids from you :D
I'm actually really happy that you're focusing on this channel more. It's amazing. Cats + cooking skills = everything.
cat food please ..
Haku is the feline equivalent of a Good Boy. Also, that looks very tasty! Itedakimasu
In Estonian, junn means turd...
Awesome recipe. ありがとう👌
Your knives look incredible! How much would your large Chefs knife cost buy outside of Japan? Love the channel. Your Kitteh's are amazing!!
Why do I have the feeling this cat eats and lives better than me
掃除が大変そうですね😂お疲れ様でした！
I can't even. It's that beautiful.
your cooking videos are poetry <3
Are you farmer?
What was the machine at 1 minute?
I think this is the only vid without seafood. Or meat
Mmmmmm😊😊😊
Just a tip for the chocolate, if you melt it like Jun did, make sure you don't get any water in the chocolate!! It will seize and be clumpy! :3
2 HOURS LATE
Omg Poki is in this one!
What does this industrial machine in the beginning of the video do?
everything is perfect in japan
i hope you are in heaven after you passed away
Gonna make this tmr 🙌 Thanks for the easy recipe Jun!
I wish my cat was as obedient as yours
Japan is so awesome.  Fresh rice, fabulous tea, ramen and Jun and Rachel  plus kitties   If I ever got there I would never leave.
Leave it to Jun to make something as simple as rice into a beautiful and elegant dish. 😍😍😍
おもしろ〜👹
YAY POKI!!!
I'm currently working my on watching Food Wars the 3rd Plate and for some reason I can imagine Jun participating in a shokugeki, that would be fun to see lol
美味しそうw
First off I'm glad Poki is at the big kids table!! It was so nice to see him here.   Second, can you explain the rice machine? I'd love to know more about that. 👍🏼
Welcome to the rice fields...
Hope Rachel got to eat it this time
Oyakodon next plz :D
Poki got to join in!! Yay!!
Thee drone shots <3
Omg Poki is finally sitting in the VIP chair! :D
I wanna try eating my meat and veggies with some of those popped rice
Enjoying my coffee and watching Jun's Kitchen. Just perfect.
Jun, I love your videos and have been missing them so much 😀 thank you for always posting with such high quality and I can't wait to see more!
Make some behind the scenes vids
It's my first time being so early in your channel, hello owo / !
The presentation of poprice is beautiful and Hako is soooooooooooooooo adorable :)
低評価が付く意味が分からんぞ...
おしゃれ➰よし頑張ろう
Woww Poki got to watch! Good boy!
so it's basically a fancy crunch bar
猫可愛い！！
You videos are always relaxing that I watch them every night to sleep lol
Where u buy itm
You really should replace your shifter cable and housing.
You know the whole purpose of me following you is for your cats right? lol
たのしみにしてました！！！
いや食べてる箸ほっそ（笑） こんなもんだっけ
Where do I sign to marry you? I can also use a kitty costume 24/7 if you're accepting a new cat.
This is Cat from  Brooklyn NY!🐱  WOW! What an awesome video!THANKS!🐅❤🍚🍫🐆❤🍚🍫🌼🕯✌🐈🕎🎄☮🐱
Is Popcorn rice ever eaten with milk like a cereal.  Have you ever eaten Special K cereal while in America? Would you describe the difference.  I'd love to hear you describe the differences between Japanese and American foods that are supposed to be the same things.
I love how Poki is like “What is this madness” when the rice is popping
Good Job Poki!! You are finally able to stay in one spot for a more than 5 seconds!!
Everything about these videos, from the cooking techniques, camerawork, editing and finished product is a work of art! <3
いつも動画楽しみにしています。 猫がいて、美味しそうな料理に癒されます😊
How did Poki not jump into the oil
Amazing & delicious video! Keep up the good work!
Juns Kitchen makes the best videos
あのパフってほんとにお米から作ってたんだ...www小麦粉かとおもってた
Quick question.  Do your cats ever try to eat the ingredients when you show it to them?
Is this life? Cuz this is life 🌾🍫🤤
so cute!!!!!
Omg.. your videos make me calm and love life. I love watching them. I forget about everything wrong in life.
Get this to trending guys, this video is amazing
I'm having such stressful days, your videos are everything that I need to remind myself to chill
Here before this gets on trending lol! But! POKI'S FINALLY AT THE TABLE!
Such a a great channel. Even if uploads are less common, they're all gems. So much refinement in each video. Keep up the great work man! Haku is best cat.
これこそ YouTubeって感じでいい！！
This was a neat recipe. I love that you use ingredients from your uncle's farm :D
I want 3 hr videos , so calming and relaxing and beautiful
How true professionals open chocolate bars. 2:50
Japanese rice are fat and fluffy I going to japan on 24 yeah
Camera quality amazing as always
If a new master adopts them, those cats would prolly die starving as they're used to 5star premium foods everyday.
Do I have to use canola oil can I use any other oil
poki is trained now yay
Jun you’re an artist! I love your video style and your soft calming voice. I didn’t know that’s how puffed rice is made. Thank you for sharing, I will give it a try. 😁💖
Love these videos. Thats the most laid back cat ever. Im convinced the kitty is either a pot head or discovered how to meditate and be so chilled out and well behaved all the time.
Jun, your videos are a work of art! So beautiful!😊
POKIIIIII~~!!
Kitty!!
あとの考えたらやりたくなくなった〜( ꈨຶ ˙̫̮ ꈨຶ )
When i realize finally poki there
Does the recipe work with long grain rice? Or does it have to be short grain?
Poki! Never even heard of pop rice have to try it sometime :)
ジュンさんの動画 和むからほんと好き
Allllllllll the cats are so cute ❤❤❤
Looks yummy 😋😋😋 maybe will try make this next year~ love this video. Haku and Nagi still cute as always and Poki make me gasp 😁😁😁 by the way i would like to request curry rice for the next video if you don't mind. Thank you so much
so do you guys have a drone or something? kinda wondering how you get all the shots you do
Poki!!!❤ :D
Aghhhhh finally 🙌🙌🙌
お米弾けるのしらなかったー
your knifes looks so good
what time are over there right now? in my country it 10.32 pm right now.
やっぱラファエルよりこっちかなぁ、、(￣∇￣)
oh in indonesia it is called rengginang. it served as snack. usualy we eat it as a side chips.
Maybe next time Jun try to do an omakase and serve it to the cats!
Someone with a fake JunsKitchen account is posting a link with malware in it (see down below) .. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv4zi2WJRSxEYSD_6q4IhMg/featured
So peaceful.
Having oil fly all over the place makes me a bit nervous, especially with the cats next to it.
You clearly are an artist !
who tf downvoted this. this is basically just a vid on how to make poprice wtf
Great video, you’re cats are beautiful! Any idea what to do with the oil you have leftover when you’re done?
I don’t even cook. You’re just fun to watch, honestly.
We make Rice Chips called Ranginang here in Indonesia. Pretty much the same technique. Its suuupper yummeeh... Oh hi Poki.. Finally shows up in VIP seat of Jun's Kitchen 🎊🎉🎉🎊🎉
Massive quality improvements
You make it look so easy . :D
I absolutely love this channel, the stuff you make is amazing! And the videos are so high quality.. I am amazed  :D
Been waiting so long for a new video <3
I love your videos but i feel a little sad everytime i see poki he reminds me of my cat that passed away last week
yaaaayyyy new episode
I love this channel so much so claming and relaxing to watch
Never knew rice could be this beautiful.
there is a chocolatesnack here in Germany called "Nippon" it is Puffedrice with chocolate ;-) http://www.hosta-group.com/Nippon_Haeppchen_ENGL.html
That's so pretty.. also was Haku alright with the popping rice ? (I'm afraid with the oils that splashing like that) btw, will you make some food with Christmas theme or New year's food like the one in the animation ? That'll be awesome
Poki!!! Didn’t think he would ever be in these kind of videos. It was nice seeing him and also you. Miss seeing your videos. Can’t wait to see more!! 🖤🖤
I bet a box of bbq chips that jun doesnt respond to this comment
Its been a long time Jun !
Lov it so much
This is one of the best videos I ve ever seen.  Very pleasing to watch. I am absolutely going to make this, but I wish I could have this experience from the beginning to the end just like you made it. May I ask what the machine was going to put the rice before you took it to the kitchen?
omigosh.. Poki has graced us with his presence! He finally has the front row seat! This is a nice video. Can it be done also with long grain rice?
( ͡° ͜つ ͡°)
Japan is nice place. l like it .and you cat food video so nice.l am from jndia brother jun .
Poki is finally sitting peacefully!
こんばんは!日本語でサブタイトルがあるのはありがたいです! Thank you very much!
Every video you make is aesthetically pleasing ❤
Finally featuring Poki on Jun's kitchen!!

All your videos are literally art. I'm amazed.
Oh that rice machine thingy is cool!  Also...yay poki at the table!

I'm here for the cats 😻
Omg @JunsKitchen POKI DIDNT SAY ANYTHING
ชอบมากๆๆๆๆๆๆๆ
Hi June. I click so fast when I see Junkitchen. So nice to see your vlog again. Your presentation is on point every times 🌼🌸🌺.
What was that machine you used in the beginning to process the rice?
I NEVER HEARD ABOUT RICE POPCORN 🍿!!!
Your cooking is almost as beautiful as Haku!
saludos desde Chile i love cats
so, what kind of shop is that? just for clean/peal rice? and is it common?
Why is it always so entertaining to watch Jun cook 😆✨
Plz make tamagoyaki
when poki's eyes go big at 2:04 hehe too qt
Welcome to the rice fields
I like this video. Very comfort feeling and such loving dedication to the food.
I love these videos so much
FINALLY A NEW VIDEO
FINALLY POKI IS ON JUN KITCHEN VIDEO XD
Hey could you tell me what kind of rice you used? It looks so beautiful and delicious and I really like to try that myself ^^
Why is this in my recommended? ... I mean I don t mind.
ぽんがし！
I hate your vid its just makes me want to eat and i will become FATTER
Suggestion to rename Jun's Kitchen to Jun's Kitten
I'm so happy to finally see Poki in one of your cooking-videos!
i've never been so damn excited for a video before lol
I love these!
I wanna try this for Xmas!! Finally a recipe on my level... I'll still probably set the house on fire trying it
Never would've thought that rice could pop. Very interesting!!😃
Eeey
What kind of knife was that? It looked very effective. Side note, I don't think you have enough cats. You should adopt more cats.
So cool to watch farming culture in Japan :D
Poki is on the table <3
Jun,you are so creative and your cats are so beautiful.
He makes everything look so damn elegant!
お米でポップコーン(矛盾)
why does jun not use the stoves behind him?
this is really i cool i didn't you could fry rice
Damn dude how u get those shots at the start?;
Every time i watch your videos i wanna be a chef or at least to have your cooking skills! Love all of your videos.
夜に見たらお菓子食べたくなっちゃうよー( ˃ ⌑ ˂ഃ )
this is the most artistic cooking channel on youtube, literally, tv shows dont put this much effort in their episodes.
猫が羨ましい🐈
Yummy :3
米でポップコーンが作れるなんて知りませんでした❗
i just love your cats
Rip net neutrality
ラファエルとは比べものにならんな笑 れべち！
ジュンさーん😢なんか今動画見るのに問題ばかり発生して見れない状態です😭😭ジュンさんはどうですか？

Wow that’s how puffed rice is made

I’m a simple man, I saw Poki in the thumbnail, I clicked.
Iae cara
あーかわいいなぁこはちゃん。ぽきもなぎちゃんもかわいいなぁ Junさんスイーツ系も開拓してくんですかね
Your cut is so cute!
God, I love the countryside scenery!!!!! Can't wait to visit Japan !
ほんとくっそ田舎(笑) うらやま
So simple, but it looks so beautiful. Awesome job Jun.
Poki is so quiet. Is this kitty on drugs? 😀
毎回お洒落な動画ありがとうございます！
how to be an ideal husbando
You're simply the best! From syria with  ❤..
He ate puffed rice in chocolate with a chopstick
高評価8000で低評価20ってすごいな
Unless my phone just got and upgrade or this is a new camera that’s reallllllly fucking good
I love your videos. Always perfect and soothing to watch !
More proof that Jun is a cat-based wizard. A neko-mancer.
包丁どこの使ってるんだろうカッコイイ
板チョコ切るときの音が音フェチにはたまらん笑笑😍😍
Damnit. Now I want some Meiji chocolate.
You can also use it for a cold cereal.
:3
Why the hell i see this when im hungry
久しぶりだー！！！！やったあ（＾ω＾）
All the kitties on sniffing duty!!! *.*
It's funny to see Poki not consuming everything you let him smell although he's such a hungry cat. :D
Finally, a recipe that I can make XD
チョコの開け方かっこいい！
Can you eat this while watching a movie
А потом вспомните,что вы живете в России
If you melt chocolate, make sure that it has cooled down to about 30°C.  The chocolates will come out a bit shinier :D To cool down melted chocolate, just mix in some chopped up pieces (about 1/3 of the liquid mass) to bring down zhe temperature.
Your hands are so beautiful❤
You're cinematography has gone up by a huge step! Great drone footage!  I'm surprised you used Hershey's, though. I figured you've got a lot better choices over there than oversweetened American chocolate 😂
I love how you treat your cats you involve them in evry single detail.thank u to be so nice
That is so much easier than doing a bain marie
*YAAASSSSSSSS NEW VID*
FINALLY
Im early!! (Somehwat...? :D ) Nice video! Hello  Poki!

Can't wait for my daughter to get out of school, watch this video, and hope she wants to make it. we're doing it anyway :) Happy holidays!!! from Florida USA
Poki did a good job!! I'm so proud of him!
New Video !!!!!!!!
The videos are so chill man
Jun, I love love when you let your cat see the product in ur hands. Since I watch your video, I do the same with my Marley, it feels like a special bond ^^
What is that knife you used, I'm in love with all your knives particularly the Damascus one with the natural wood handle.
A simple dish looks like a high class dessert.
どの調理器具もオシャレですね～。 ポップライス知りませんでした。今度試してみます。(^^)
I take it Poki's finally well behaved enough to appear in the videos lol
wooo an easy recipe
hi, would this recipe work using sunflower oil?
Wait you can fry any kind of rice to have rice pop-corn?
Cat actually hate the chocolate
So lovely..
do you have to use a certain type of rice for this? or will any rice works just fine?
That looks so good! ^o^ And the presentation was very simple and beautiful~
久しぶりの投稿！待ってました！
Yesterday had a look at your channel page to verify I didnt miss your video! And today you posted! It was totally worth the wait!:)
Poki is so well-behaved!!!!!
Now you're all just making me really hungry haha  poki is now in viewing sessions!  good we need more kitties
Only Jun can even make unwrapping chocolate look elegant.
Does it matter what kind of rice you use or will all types of rice do this? I think i have japanese rice somewhere, but basmati is the cheaper stuff and i have a tonne of that lol
Lol, you make this simple dish so beautiful and luxurious :))) Didn't expect it to turn into a rose shape ~!
*_Beautiful_* 😍😍
I'd comment about the video but the FCC says I'd have to pay $0.99
U MAKE ME SO HUNGEY but I love the vids and I’m going to Japan next week see u soon maby 😀😀😀
Poki!  You were so well behaved in this video!  so proud of you!
Can you puff rice in the microwave?
Your videos make me happy. For a short time I forget everything around me and just get caught in your video :)
Gosh, I love Poki. Such a silly boy. <3
I read popcorn rice as peppered rice, i was so comfused
Your videos are so relaxing
Wow - Love this  so much ! Thank you for sharing ;o)
I like your cat
so romantic Jun. Your wife has chance !
I have to say, your videos are fantastic! So beautifully presented. And your cats are adorable. I could watch your channel all day!
Finally!!!!
How nice to see the natural rice after  video from China about fake plastic rice. Thanks
Oh the black cat doesn't just eat whatever it sees! And Yay thanks for this easy and makable recipe :D
Wow rice can be popped? I had no idea
Can we make it with store bought rice?
poki dunno what to steal
i think ive been by those fields
The video lags ?
Chocolate is dangerous for cats, and it's best to keep your cats away from them.(˶‾᷄⁻̫‾᷅˵)
Why everything he do look so epic? Any tips to be awesome??
動画出るのいつも楽しみにしてます！
I hope this video would trending 🍿
I'm just here for the cat xD
The initial shots (the ones of the landscape) and the overall quality of this video are amazing!!! Keep it up
jun is a stud
why you don't try making a rengginang? it's pretty delicious.Just like making a poprice but it like round shape. #sorryforRIPEnglish :v
Can we use normal long rice?
Hi Uncle!!
This may be the most relaxing thing I have ever seen!
Poor Haku was like "incoming hot projectiles GET TO THE CHOPPA" lmaoooo
Hey, in the future when you record some recipes, can you say if it is halal? I am interested in it but not sure whether I can eat it.
THE RICE goes POP POP POP AND A POP BASKRRRRRRRRA
I love cute cat's so beautiful💕
HE UPLOADED!!!!
I never thought chocolate and rice can be together. Damn Jun! That's good! 👏
Yoummi😋
Please upload some more!😅. Your videos is so satisfying when you cooks and also with the cats🐱❤️
*whoa technology*
Junskitchen is back..!!  😇

WHAT?
Poki: Edible Fireworks O _O!
*sees Poki on the chair* YOU MEAN THAT "I WILL DO DESTROY ANYTHING FOR FOOD" CAT IS SITTING PATIENTLY ON THE CHAIR??? i think im overdramatic but come on
I fully approve of the wholesome moments of Poki being hecking spooked by the deep fryer
Is this shokugeki no soma?
なんちゅー素敵な動画やねん… 同じYouTuberとして恥ずかしくなってくる…  俺もいつか同じ位置に…  いつも素敵な動画ありがとうございます！w
always a pleasure watching your vids, theyre so well done and youre so good at what you do
I always have this thought that who ever lives near the rice fields are buff as hell or living the good life
Jun is an artist and Poki was such a good boy!
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique
Doma taihei in real live😂
Best Quality video ever
What were that rice machine thingy?
4K Cooking video o: (with lovely cats)
SO AESTHETIC
You don’t need oil if you’re watching your calories. You can pop rice in hot salt. Use pure salt without any additives. The finer the better. You need enough of it to bury all the rice or corn without losing too much heat. Heat it up in an oven, take it out, quickly add the rice, close the lid, shake, wait a few seconds till it pops, sift it, put the salt back into the oven, and repeat.
hahahh how your uncle tickles Haku's ear hair hahaha I LOVE IT!!!
A great way to start my friday.
Rengginang versi modern
Step 1 to make a popcorn rice : Make sure you have access to the rice fields...
美しすぎる
Fine dining with chocolate and rice XD
Can you teach my boyfriend how to love cooking? XD
珍しい…ポキがいるw
Now I'm a bit earlier than before
お米でポップコーンじゃなくて、ポップライス？って作れるんですね。私も米農家なので機会があったらやってみようと思います。素晴らしい動画ありがとうございました😊
投稿待ってました！どうやったらそんなに料理が上手くなるんでしょうか?？
i love it  when he used knife to  open the chocolate wrapper.. maybe i should do the same lok
Konbanbwa Jun!
Очень здорово! Очень просто, но очень здорово! Ты, как всегда, на высоте! Спасибо!
Love it!  These video make me so happy. Food and cats, can't get any better than that.

So happy to finally see Poki-chan! Lovely video as always, keep up the good work :)
Great video Jun.
That is one hefty knife you got their Jun.
It seems very good! A cat is cute also (heart).
Where have u been watashi no sensei
Yes! Juns kitchen and Its Alive with Brad Leone new videos all in one days YESSSS
U should open your own restaurant
I had no idea that's how you made puffed rice! I'll have to try it tonight while I already have the oil hot for latkes!  If it works well for me, I might have to make this a regular hanukkah treat! It might be the answer to the hungry people waiting for dinner problem! I just make some puffed rice first, and let people eat that while i make the latkes! :3
ほんと器用にキレイに作りますね～
AHHH finally a new video💕. That's my favorite channel ever
I Always Enjoy Watch your Videos 🖒
watching vlogs about life in japan makes me want to live there. everything seems to be in a perfect harmony. ps i love your cats so much
It's been so long since he's uploaded I forgot I subscribed to him
I thought the reason Poki wasnt in Jun's cooking videos because steals all the food hahah
I am always amazed by your beautiful creations!
I love food, so I subbed.
Well done on getting 1 you deserve it
How you managed to make such a simple dish look so beautiful and elegant I will never understand! Your skills are seriously impressive! (Also how on earth did you manage to convince Poki not to eat what you were making?)
I like the content but i realy like haku(you're cat)😘😘
いつもお料理美味しそうですね！見た目も綺麗だし、なんといっても猫ちゃん達が大人しく見ていてとっても可愛いです😄💕 最近見始めましたがこれからも楽しみにしています🎶✨
I love all your video! Please update more often! hahaha!

お米最高( ๑･ิω･ิ๑)و ｸ
Liked before the video finished! Love your video's Jun!!!
Feels like I am watching a japanese beautiful movie in the early morning, So lovely 🍚💙
It's nice to see that Poki's learned to behave enough to get to be in a cooking video, although I doubt he's got enough control to be present for anything that would involve meat.
Jun's videos are always so soothing ❤️ He makes cooking look magical! Also, loved seeing poki in this one 💕
Category: *A S I A N*
I saw junskitchen I click
Wah! I saw the yt notification when I just stepped out of the school gates. Immediately rushed back home to watch this video. Awesome as always!!!!
It should be called poprice
Főzni akarok😂😂
It's strange seeing Poki sitting quietly, nice video!
Amazing!
ネコがジワる(´°‐°｀)
おいしそうです。
lucky to be your cats
When Jun dropped the rice into the hot oil at 1:59 Poki's face was hilarious😹😹😹 He/It was like : ' What the hell are you doing?!' 😹👍 (Btw I'm so in love with Haku❤)
いつもはこんなこと思わないんですがポップコーンを掬っている時に猫ちゃんが近くて火傷しちゃうんじゃないかとヒヤヒヤしちゃいました😅 まあジュンさんなのできっと大丈夫なんでしょうけどね!!
ダマスカス模様の包丁かっけぇ…
YAY!! Poki was quiet enough to be in a video!!
This looks delicious
新米を揚げちゃうんですね… 贅沢✨✨✨
this chanel...it's like 癒し系～！おつくれさまです
Poki!
AAAAA I MISSED UR VIDEOS AND CATS AND FOOD AND U SO MUCH

You always have such simple yet beautiful plating ❤
Beautiful Plating.   I love the aesthetic of your videos.  They leave me calm and happy.

Rise krispie
Haku ❤️
趣味のレベルじゃないです…ガチの料理人じゃないですか！ 料理の参考にさせてもらってます
ポップコーンというよりパフみたいですね！相変わらず盛り付けが綺麗...🙌💕
米を揚げっているとき出た声がなんか面白そう！
In Indonesia we have dish of corn rice.. from some village society, in Japan they have popcorn rice because japan have anime pop culture 😹😹
Presentation is purfect 🐈👌
Love watching your cats go on bike rides with you. This was so sweet and cool too.
Hhhmmmm so delecious
YUM!
Poki was in a video and DIDN'T try to eat everything in sight? I guess miracles do happen 😅
Is the rice like Rice Krispys?
My mom would make this at home from left over rice 😊
SATISFYING
How do you even make such a simple recipe look so amazing?! Love your content as always! Much love from Indonesia :)
ポップコーンって苦手なんだけど食べたくなった🍿
Cool
Yes new video
I missed your videos and your cats❤️
I love your channel, and cats are so cute! ❤
JUN if you want your chocolate to look shiny on the outside like the one right out of the box than you need it to have the right temperature. That usually means to melt the chocolate at around 30-35 ℃ , to than let it cool to around 27℃ . At that temperature small crystals for inside the chocolate. Afterwards you warm it up again to around 32℃ (that way those crystals don't melt yet but stay intact while the chocolate is more runny). Now you can glaze with it or make your little sweets :D
love from singapore
いやマジで動画出すの遅いっすよ先輩。
I love it when you post!!
Hey, we eat this in India! But instead of chocolate, we add peanuts or chickpeas. In the South, we tend to add a lot of spice and chopped veggies and we eat it as a popular street snack.
If it's rice, can you really call it "popcorn"? Poprice makes more sense :P
I'm early!!
What type of rice can I use? I cannot get fresh rice like you... Normal jasmine rice?
oh! Poki's there!
いつも楽しく見てます‼︎ 高校で、お料理の学校に行くので、いつも参考にしてます！
Is this in Tokyo? It's seems so serene and peaceful with modern houses and farming in the same area.
fancy rice crispies
もうオシャレを通り越してるよね！ （？）
My favorite cooking channel
You should temper the chocolate my dude

Thai sub~~ 😿😭
1- he went to get the rice from an actual farm. 2- he fried it himself. 3- not only did he open the chocolate with an elegant slice of his knife, he then ate said chocolate with chop sticks.  Its called class people. Class.
HELLLOOOOO
That knife! Soo sexy!
My God. As always, japan's country side is astonishing.
料理も風景も、すべてが芸術的ですね。本当に、すばらしい！

Hi jun. I’m a new subscriber and I love your videos. But I have a question about this video. When you when to get the rice, what would be the next best thing instead of farm grown rice? Please answer when you have the time.

Chocolate and kitties are all the things I need right now, thus I’m quite happy with this video!  They are all so cute! And well behaved too! How old are they?  Also, which chocolate did you use? Milk? Dark? Semi sweet?

What was that machine that made the rice ??
Hello dude, I love your channel and your cooking skills you're videos are just amazing keep on the good work
Can the next video be about sushi?I think everybody will like it.
How on earth did you train haku to stay in the basket?😱😱😱 Amazing video as always!
Poki's finally able to sit at the big boy table!! Although maybe not yet for recipes that have fish...
Okay the food looks incredible but can we talk about how high you can set the quality on this video? I've never seen another video with such a quality option
猫にポン菓子が飛んでいきそうで火傷するかとドキドキしたわｗ
I'm never disappointed by your videos!
You’d do well if you had a cooking show. Especially with the cats. I enjoyed this! Thank you.
We actually make this during Indian Weddings, though we are not allowed to eat it XD This just reminds me to make some one day!
Drone shots!!❤️❤️ and haku
Looks really good.  The description box has different ingredients listed thou.
I just realize all videos on Junskitchen has no ads
Finally! Poki watched how Jun cooks haha!
Japan and it's technology
Looks tasty
Uch your videos are so easthetically pleasing! 💖
Hey question is there a way u can try to make some vegetarian things? Cuz im trying to learn to cook and to eat healthier and ur the best cook I've seen so far and I watch all ur vids😊

クッキングチャンネルは自分の中ではきまぐれとjunが一番
Thank you so much for the recipe...My family loves puffed rice...it's called 'muri' in our country...we usually pair it with savory flavour...will definitely try making those....arigato😊😊
I saw poki. Is this real life?
2:17  Poki: your food make weird noise human...=_=

何だこれ美味しそう！おかきみたいですね！
I wonder if we can make it with medium grain rice.
OMG I SPOT POKIIIIII
最近見始めました〜＾＾
Jun never fails to amaze with his information, cinematography and cute cats ❤
Marvellous
You should make more and more of these videos. Junskitchen is great, cats too.
Haku
For once Poki is in the viewing seat! I guess it's because there aren't many ingredients for the kitty to steal eh?
Finally Poki is qualified enough to be in the video <3
This is so relaxing
I love the cats SOOOOOOOO much!!!!!!
First video i watch so early
Loved the video but in the description the ingredients are from the last recipe
Your uncle grows really nice rice. I wish I could have some
i really really like your movie❤
Yipppeee! I love watching all of your videos Jun, so awesome~ Aww Haku <3
Its 11pm why u upload at this time Jun its Qld time so its only 2 hours from Japanese time.
하쿠가 무슨종인지 궁금하다
Poki in the video too, great! :*
The fact that you can just bike down to a local farm, help pick out your own food and go to a public refinery-type location all within the city simply amazes me. Gotta love Japan
Yummm
なにかお仕事はされてますか？
yay, another cute cat
英語も喋れて 日本語も喋れて 料理もできる 裏山(〃ω〃)

めちゃくちゃ跳ねてて草
The combination of cats and cooking is just adorable

Poki is finally in a video! Guess he stopped stealing ingredients :D
Best like to dislike ratio I've seen in a while.
pokki gained weight. so cuteeee!!!
I love jun!!!!!
how do you get those really cinematic air shots like thats so cool
Poki's reaction to the rice as it was popping and jumping out of the pot. Oh, he's an adorable.
notification squad where are you  btw notice me senpai
同じ日本とは思えないぐらいなんか綺麗…
Does this work on any rice?? Coz japanesse rice seems difference than my local rice...
I come here for the quality of the content and quality of the cats.
美味しそうoishisou
Why does everything on this channel end up looking like a beautiful painting and my kitchen looks like a shithole?! I always assume there are lots of outtakes that get edited out, but probably not.
I wonder could you eat popped rice with salt and butter like popcorn
I just woke up and saw the title of this video, thought it was going to be an actual mixture of popcorn and rice XD
ラファエルが真似してる包丁だぁ
This channel is so pure
Maybe I missed it,but what kind of rice is that?
10 minutes then this
:oooooooooooooooooooo
Nice! I'm going to give it a try, especially the crispy chocolate :D. By the way what was that machine in that phone cell -like building?! :o
I love it.😍
もっと投稿頻度多くなってほしい😂
Aww, Poki finally calmed down enough to watch you cook!
Im waiting for too long~~~
Wow, you make cooking to art.
Yaaaaaasssss!  The only channel I will stop my day for
a English comment here
YES, FINALLY-
Everything you do looks so good!
Jun you make really good videos. I enjoy watching them
am i early
What a video to wake up to.
これ稲刈りしたあと、したに落ちてる稲拾って 集めたわらで焚き火作って その上でライスポップコーン作った！ めっちゃうまいんだよな😋
I'm new to your videos, your cats are amazing ❤❤❤
Its quite odd to just se you munching a bowl of them with no milk as in england at least puffed rice is a rarther popular breakfast cereal
The aesthetics in this video is just my style 😍
Earliest I've ever been to any video before lol to me in the first minute and didn't even see a notification. Also YAY Poki was finally in this one 😁
신기하다
いつもながら、すごい反響ですねぇ…さすがです そして、毎度のごとく猫様たちが可愛い💕
The ingredients list in the video description is wrong for this vid. But this is such a beautiful video, seriously impressed! So elegant, it's soothing to watch your process!
Yay all three cats watching you cook in this video!
Can't beat that level of freshness
What was the machine you put the rice in at the beginning?
So FREAKING BEAUTIFUL!!!😍😍
I Love you am Arbe
Two people who clicked dislikes are probably heartless murders🙄🙄🙄🙄
Suomi (ko)
I love this channel it's so satisfying never stop Jun please
Poki!!!
Wonderful.  I loved how you popped the stalks!!
うまそう！
popcorn riceってポップコーン乗っけたどんぶり？と思ったら、あられのことだったでござる
2:51 He is so classy that he use a knife to open the package. Who the fxck does that?
待ってましたー！ いつも最高の動画をありがとうございます。 お米でポップコーンなんて初めて聞きました。今度チャレンジしてみようと思います。
Haku is so cute !
finally my favorite youtuber upload a video 🙌
I've been waiting! He has less than 10 videos but I can tell they take some time.
Yay new vid
じゅんさんのオープニングを見ると, いつも地元に帰りたくなります。 久しぶりにぱんぱん菓子が食べたくなりました🌾
jun senseiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

This was beautiful! I absolutely loved it!
Hey
So rare to see Poki watching you cook in your channel
Oh woow i wanna make this!
Cute :3
what is your story about cooking ?
Your videos literally radiate tranquility
Nice Ricecrispies
YASS NEW VID AWESOME
I can't believe he used a knife to open a chocolate bar wrapper. Such a classy kind of extra.
Oh my gad 😱 i still haven't found my berries 🍇  BUUT i found thiiiss❤❤😂
I loved eating puffed rice as a kid! It's a local snack in Hawaii from plantation days from Japan. I think it's a little different here but the concept is the same. Glad I know I can make it myself now~
This made me hungry...
This looks delicious
チョコレートの袋開けるのも包丁使うんだ笑笑

You are a very talented chef but I must admit I like to watch your videos just to see Haku..I have a cat crush 😺
好味，貓貓無得食！

Oh wow so you just throw the rice into the machine and it polishes the grains? That’s amazing! But I wonder how common those machines are...
You’re honestly a genius. Such beautifully prepared, creative food, so glad I found this channel!

First
This time it's an easy recipe but it's so fun to make that I thought everyone should know how to do it! I actually forgot about pop rice (or puffed rice) until recently when we had dinner at a hotel where they actually served it to us. I personally think pop rice on the stalk is the most fun of all, but of course if you don't have access to a rice paddy then you can make this with any raw rice at all from your grocery store.
