Question....anyone know if it's safe to fire one of these if it's been in a case for 30 years? Does the inside of the barrel need oiled or inspected to be safe??
Great firearm I have a 1939  one still works perfectly.
Muzzle angels all over the place, you can show people how to check chamber, unload,  load, make safe do all the workings of the gun by pointing down range in safe direction. Just saying.
Dude, what happened to eye protection
I bet dimestore hitmen watch this video form New Jersey
When i hear walther ppk, i imagine 007 James Bond😎
"Be sure there's nothing left"  Wow.
Brother Mouzone brought you here too?
Can it shoot fast?
Is this a PPK or a PPK/s?
"Rack the slide to load the weapon"  The weapon was loaded. There simply wasn't a round in the chamber. That's a difference.
7 haha it will get you through the job, as the last line of protection
A popular, but here unanswered question is; racking the slide with the safety on versus the safety off. Here we were shown how to rack with the safety off. However racking with the safety on causes the hammer to drop upon completion of the racking into the safe position. Is this advisable? Put a couple hundred rounds on this gun for a year, I haven’t shot myself yet :-) but I’m wondering if racking with safety on causes wear.
Shoulda watched this before going to the range today... Working my way up the calibers and PPK was next in line.  Damn thing is so tiny.  Without the mag extension, my pinky just hangs in the air.  Also the slide bit me repeatedly. Grouping went wide as well, since I couldn't get it properly balanced.
Oh God, be careful decocking that pistol!  Some production lots had a potential failure where they can fire on decock.  There is a recall for these affected units.
“hOw tO sHoOt tHiS PiStOl”  -like every other pistol.  🤯
Swear these mfs got a tutorial for everything
Thanks Q 😎
Shooting a ppk two handed is a crime that should be met with a mendatory re-watch of pistol training videos from the times this pistol was actually used.
Guy: *puts his hand in front the barrel multiple Bruh
I did think the guy was very clear in his instruction but not as safe as I have been taught, is this different in the US? I would normally wear eye protection also.
little more practice then make a video
james knight. siging in. thanks
I just bought a ppk, and it doesn't seem to decock. i assume not all have a decocking feature? Also, the slide will _only_ go forward when a magazine is inserted, and the trigger won't function without an inserted magazine, so it must be a different version.
I guess he doesn’t care too much for his eyes.
I guess I assumed when I clicked on this video it would be more than just a basic "how to shoot a pistol" video and maybe some specifics to the PPK other than "this pistol is small so watch out for slide bite"
how to shoot the Walther PPK .308
To all these people talking about eye protection, it's his eyes if he wants to take that risk that's his decision, I rarely use safety glasses anymore either. When the SHTF and you have to use that firearm there and then are you gonna say "wait don't shoot at me yet I need to put on my safety glasses"? To all the people calling him and idiot for not keeping it pointed down range, seems like he's the only one there, if your alone does it really matter? The part I was disappointed about is the name of the video, this isn't "how to shoot a ppk". He only went over the functions of the pistol, he didn't mention a firm grip once or how most people limp wrist the PPK and then call it a POS because it jams. After watching this most people still won't know "how to shoot a ppk".
Yes no eye protection. Not good.
Well you could also do it the traditional style and shoot it one handed. The way they did back in ww2
Never clears the gun as safe-no goggles-no muzzle discipline,The name it is video should be:a how not to do for idiots!TOOL
This guy has no clue what he's doing.
I have the walther ppk/s variation the instructions did not cross over well for other firearms and I got confused and shot a black kid
Protetor de olho que nada aqui é  raiz.
came here from sterling archer
Im looking to buy a 380 for a back up gun. I’m torn between the Beretta Pico and the Walther PPK.  I’m leaning towards the PPK because I like the safety and it seems to have very minimal muzzle jump.  I like the price and the slimness of the Pico though.  Screw it!  PPK!
Always keep a gun pointed down range. Seemed to have forgotten about that haven't you?
thanks
this guy needs some training himself before he ca make a video.
point towards enemy an squeeze
Please redo this video considering all gun safety rules. there are inexperienced shooters that might follow some of your instruction injuring themselves or people around them. Protect your eyes just in case. Be safe
PPK must b in 7.65. Thats a thing like a 1911 in .45
When you decock the gun is it in safety or can I just pull the trigger in double action
Yikes! You should always decock the gun with it pointed in a SAFE direction, not off to the side like that! There was even a recall on PPKs because the safety would actually fire off a round when decocking the gun. :p
At 1.28 the slide stays back.........how did that happen?
As a firearms instructor I will comment on one thing. When using the De-cocking/Safety on the PPK or any weapon ALWAYS point the weapon DOWNRANGE.  If I would have been in the lane to the left of this shooter at an active range I would have secured  my weapon and reported this to the range officer / safety officer.
Shooting a semi auto pistol. No eye protection. Fail.
I've been thinking of purchasing a Walther PPk (.380) but I've heard it's got quite a kick and I'm somewhat nervous due to it being my first handgun I've bought (not the first I've fired).
Good advice from a guy who looks like he was taught said advice 10 mins before this video was taken.
He shouldn't close an eye. Leave them both open and stare past the sights.
Eye protection....
Need eye protection
whuts up with the flinch and squinting >.>
