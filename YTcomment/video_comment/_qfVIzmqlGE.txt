I ham impressed
so slicey-knife the size of a short-sword, industrial meat-slicer, special ham-holder. gotcha.
I was going to buy one of these hams, but there is way too much work involved before you can eat it.
It looks very nice, but it is nothing compared to Iberico ham. Even the younger less expensive Ibericos are much superior, sorry!
To me, ham is pork mummy.
I want to taste it, it's look really good.
Delicious ham Parma From Indonesia 🙏
Isn't it raw meat?
The most useless video I've ever found... 😁
PÄRMA HÄM
So you prepare the meat for 1 year to 18 months, throw a large portion of it, eat raw, and then dump it in the toilet.... Such a waste of time..
This man looks like Jao Felix
Sarappp!😘😘😘
En comparación con el Jamón Ibérico, esto es carne cruda, con todos mis respetos... ( Perdón por no hacer el comentario en Inglés )
get a sharper knife
RATATUI.....whre your mouse
Why did I watch this when I don’t even eat ham
I never asked for this 😂😂😂😂
Wow looks amazing
gay guy at end of video - Take my ass
spanish and portuguese hams are way better
Crap, crap, crap...... Prosuito must be sliced longway, not crossway... and always with a bone in... Bonles was introduced to accomodate industry and  spoilidge. You want good prosuito insist on bone in hand sliced....
Very yummy 😋
Finally found food from tom and jerry
The same narrator as in amnesia
Ad un matrimonio molti anni fa in molise mi servirono una fettina di prosciutto crudo ..la infilai in bocca cercando di masticarla ma era impossibile ..un pezzetto scese giù per la gola.. ma il resto si incastrava tra i denti allungandosi tipo budello...stavo soffocando e morendo!!!!! davanti a tutti.. .ho respirato con il naso escludendo il sistema bocca da nuotatore ...mi sono infilato la mano. in bocca tenendo la testa alta e con le dita ho tirato fuori quasi un metro di prosciutto allungato che sentivo sfilarsi in gola e in pancia ...lo ho buttato sulla tavola e ho respirato nuovamente ..!.perche? qualcuno sa rispondermi tecnicamente??
All I know about parma it's soccer club
I can eat that allll 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗ohhh fat..... My fav part 😋😋😋😋
Menudo Charcutero....
Cómo el jamón ibérico de jabugo no hay otro.jabugo Huelva

😳 *🐷 🐷 🐷 the local pig parma Ham*
I hate this douche bags face
Sacha Baron Cohen before making it into Hollywood.
I feel pity for that pig. It was killed long ago may be a year or three. They are still cutting him.. Wait why I am here. I don't eat ham☺
Oink oink oink 🐷
>tyrosine So if you take an MAOI, eating this is a good way to die! Neat!
damn i want some
Why am i here
i bet he got a rat on his hat
I was eating parma ham
The game Cooking Adventure brought me here
Who eat this vegetarian forever
Raw pig, isn't that dangerous..?
This guy really can’t cut by hand...
Like I could afford a whole Parma ham...
Haram
At no point in the video was the trademark Parma ducal crown visible I question the authenticity of the cam he was slicing without the Parma ducal crown Visible.  That ham was a fake for sure
salivating just watching it . but i'll have to wait till my next trip over, cause i sure wont afford imported prices (as for cheeses and other delis)
The god farther he ate this ham .
B
Ok....we slice ham on 0.8 cm.....and not soo fat like u do guys.....Kras  ham...best of the best....
RemoVE PrOtEcTinG WrApInG. guess How many Moron who Fail in this First Step??
Idk why but that guy has a seriously punchable face.
i want to start noshing on that ham, just like a huge turkey drumstick !
after slicing, teach us how to eat this ham
Hey deli guy, theres a fucking line here bro, hurry it up, i gotta catch the bus, cut me a pound super thin but dont take more than 2 minutes, trim all the fat off would ya....these are all the fucking things american italians say when im cutting them this product because they arent italian.
I appreciate the hard work, science and artistry that goes into making this product so much I don't mind paying $25 a lb.
Here in Axom, we kill the fucking pig, chop it into pieces, cook it and eat it. Then we sleep.
After cutting, do you cover the exposed area with the tan mixture of lard, salt and pepper to preserve until the next customer asks for a cut?  Appropriately how many thin cuts do you get before hitting the shank?
Wow, he failed pretty hard at producing thin slices when hand cutting the ham.
This is making my mouth water..
I love original italian food
good one boss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BctLHxO8HEM&t=118s
I will never use this information but thank you anyway YouTube suggestions
that looks delicious
it's 11pm on a stormy night and i am watching this. damn.
I can't tell if the narrator is Italian or Welsh.
i have exam tomorrow why am I watching this
I really enjoy seeing people take pride in their food.
Paama ham where from animals
Is the narrator Welsh/Italian ?
good
I have exam tomorrow
😍
Yak
The most sublime existing flavor amongst natural unprocessed food. Always look for the "Parma" brand on the rind. Plenty of fakes out there.
Ok. Tips are cool. But, first, removing the wrap is kind of obvious...
it cant compare with spanish jamon
What is parma Ham?
This guy sucks at slicing.
I've never understood why you want the fat on the slice of parma ham. I enjoy fat on my pork and my steaks. But when it comes to cured ham, I just think the fat tends to separate from the meat so easily and become a long strand that is hard to chew and swallow.
he's got a good accent
I’m eating parma right now mmmhhh!!!
this is pretty much sacha baron cohen's accent in talledega nights
Take a shot every time he says slice
Youtube really wanted me to watch this
I can proudly say i am now skilled in the craft of handling both parma ham and parmessano reggiano. Thanks, youtube algorithm.
Why i am even watching this??
Step aside peasants! Jamón serrano master race!
Spanish ham is better...
Jamon iberico.... nada mas que añadir...
They Must be hamdled With Great Care
It's a me, a Mario!

I'm never gonna buy Parma ham why did I watch this
this is more like Parma Ham chopping
i dont understand people who can eat something that completely resembles human skin and flesh... you guys need your heads checked... im sorry
Mirip bngt nich cwo kaya koki yg di film animasi Ratatouille
How the hell did I get here?
Looks like the ham I cooked for dinner about a week ago
It sounds like the commentator is from UK, then forgot, then remembered, then forgot, then remembered, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g3sXjOnBPI asi se corta el jamon ;)
They should run it by machine rather than by hand. A sharp, firmly held machine-guided knife would cut nearly perfectly flat, uniform, and unmarred slices. Look at the ham cut by hand here. The slices are uneven, and the top fatty layer falls off because he is not getting a clean cut through. He himself says that retaining the fat is what gives this ham its sweet flavor. Makes 0 sense to cut it by hand rather than machine unless the guy is as good as a machine. Which, he isn't.
he looks like the chef from ratatouille
Cinco ochento cinco ochento cinco ochento cinco ochento Cinco ochento cinco ochento cinco ochento cinco ochento Cinco ochento cinco ochento cinco ochento cinco ochento    Like if you get it

U don eat ham id prefer beef it tastes better
Esto es lo mejor que tiene para ofrecer España, bienvenidos guiris :D.
cause its beautiful.  would love you learn everything they know
JewJew on that beat
lol
Its actually 4 am what I ham doing
its funny that all says that the italian ham is the best ad in particular parma ones, except the spanish that says that their one is the best ahhahahaha 😂
I hate when people mistake mouth-feeling for taste. There is no taste in fat, fat is just large amounts of triglycerides, they have no effect on our tasting buds. But fat can leave a pleasant feeling when eaten, after all it is necessary for our metabolism. But there is no flavor in fat.
If you need to know how to carve a Parma ham, you know you've made it in life.
bunu yiyenin anasını sikeyim
Couldn't they find a better name than Ham Clam? Also, where do I buy one?
jamon iberico FTW
Best Jam is from Spain!
hi
How much does this whole thing cost?
5 minutes and 40 seconds of my life I can never get back.
He looks like mat3756
If fat protects the ham, why does the back 70% without the fat not matter? This is such an overpriced over rated ham. yes I have had it, it's salt that's it.
fuck islam
much better hum is our homemade here in voivodina ...
Tomorrow i`m gonna buy some ham... It`s just delicious :D
jamón ibérico spain
짜겠다
spanish jamon iberico is way way better
NO OFFENSE BUT THIS SEEMS SO HARAM!
I like 1 kilo please . How much?
I come from 'how to cut a parmesan cheese' 😉
hele bizim pastırmayı yiyin bi
I'd like this gentleman to work on my hams next.
the guys doesnt cut good the ham manualy... keep using your machine xD
I am having an exam in 4 hours, why am I watching this?
240 ppl are vegans
I buy a ham I eat it how I want.
french ham of Bayonne is better!
its not a food porn thats the prelude or the erotical overture for it^^
Who are the 231 dumb people ????  This is Original  This is history !!!!!
disgusting...
on 5:17 it's like slicing the bread
Why did I just watch a guy cutting ham for 5 mins
Why am I watching a guy cutting a ham instead of studying?
How long has borat been slicing these hams lmao
a
No he probado este tipo de jamón, por ello, no puedo comparar. Aún así, yo optaría por un ibérico de bellota. Por lo que puedo ver en este vídeo, parece un serrano de los nuestros.
how much money is a new ham?!
para q le pones otro idioma wey si esta hablando en español carajo
jamón ibérico español joder todo lo demás es mierda
the italian accent of the guy talking in english is hilarious
so you cut away the rind, right?
Good ham, but i prefer spanish ham, Ibérico ham.
I can see a lot of passion in here.. This is great..
Talking, talking, talking......stupidos
Didn't the Lord say don't eat that ?
omg...please, before doing a video, first learn how to cut ham professionaly...
Looking at the end I will do this better. It's easy when you have a machine of thousand dollars. Take the knife and do that. Totally failed...
i have no fuckin idea why I am watching this
and when im thinking other die because lack of food and these guys are throwing "small imperfections"
poca idea de cortar jamón amigo
I was thinking bacon all throughout the video..
ibérico >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> parma
what a difference towards what you get in Germany... Here you get slice on slice, making them difficult to take apart and on top of that the rule no 2 ( :D ) is not respected... they let the slices of ham at the counter and they dry out...not comparable to the way Italians do it. What a shame...
thx
I wish they got Ringo Star to voice this.
Spanish cured ham is better anyway.
game stop neck..
I can't figure out if the narrator is the Italian or from South Wales...  :/
whats the point of such thin slices...
fuck off i dont like the fat, remove all the fat!!!
the dude narrating this sounds like he moved from spain to liverpool
a real real real shit cut on this poor ham. SHAME
HALLO no tell my IMAM or my mothers cousins naybour i see this vid or they killed me but bismillah n goodbuy at QUETTA form Balochistan
i have no idea why i watched the whole thing
What company is this product from? Im not sure he mentions it in the video.
Its parm aham, when you cut parma ham its parma ham
because it is the fat that gives the ham its sweetness taste
Fresh sliced parma ham is heaven!, but. I like my parma ham salty also.. Sometimes I slice it, and leave in the refrigerator overnight just to dry it out and make it more salty! Exactly the opposite of what this guy is saying.. It's all down to taste and preferences! (cook it like bacon in your frying pan!)
Unsaturated fat? Is that another BS fact in your long list of total BS? Or is it what modern Italian schools teach?
pork fat is saturated. curing doesn't change the fat to unsaturated type.
im just trying to figure out if the voice actor used an italian accent because hes translating an italian , or because he is italian.
is the meat still raw or ready to be eaten?
i purchased this ham around 9 or 10 kilos 28 months old and the taste is not bad..... but i really prepare the spanish iberico ham more salty sweatness and the aroma is absolutely fantastic...i rate this ham 3 stars
pork is forbidden meat right? no?
Wow!
Wow!
looks like some kind of mutated crocodile at 0:12
Food propaganda
How did I get here?  Why did I watch this?
islam islam islam
Saturated fatty acid and cholesterol are two distinct types of molecules. Low saturated fatty acid doesn't mean there is low cholesterol.

Carving by hand, the slices should be very thin, thinner then shown in the video !
Amazing!
