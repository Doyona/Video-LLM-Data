I just found your channel and I'm hooked lol...You have a new subscriber🎥🎥❤✔💯💯Thank you for the ideas Stay Blessed🙏🙏✔
I most try thank you 💃🏾💕💕
Wow! This is cool
I just started drinking ACV Monday & came across your videos to find a way to make it taste less acidic and horrible and I just gotta tell you that you saved my life! Today is my first time adding frozen fruit to the mix and it’s a game changer. Makes it so much easier to drink the ACV. 🙌🏽
I NEVER was able to drink AVC even if I put it in 44 oz of water, then I found your video!!! You saved me!!!
Thanks! I'm gonna try these recipes! I've been drinking acv with lemon only but gonna try mixing in the fruit. 👍
Wow great idea thank you baby
Hi, I thought that drinking to much acv in 1 day isn't good. From my research 2tbs is sufficient. My point isnt to knock what you're doing but to see what research you found that says it's ok for this amount of acv in 1 day(8tbs). I love the ideas definitely going to use them.
Chileeeee why didn't I ever think to blend 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ even tho I have done the shots.....I feel like this is a good way to switch it up sometimes so I don't get bored, thanks!
Can I make a large batch leave it in the fridge for 1 to 2 day?
Girl you got part of this all wrong. Fresh organic lemons. Not the bottled stuff because that is extremely toxic to the system. Overwhelm ingly bad. You need more education on cleaning rituals. 😣
Thank you!
Hi I have a question can I use the apple cider vinegar with the mother and add it to my morning smoothies? Will it still work the same?? Please let me know thank you!
What store?????
Where can I buy it Apple cider vinegar
Started doing ACV cleanse and love it!
Be careful of plastics.  Don’t think those bottles are BPA free.  Use glass jars.
Does it hide the vinegar taste?
What size is the bottle as I cant get onto new link
How did you actually do the cleanse?
You just saved my entire left side lol🖤💜💜
I love these recipes!!!! Thank you for sharing!
How long can I store these??? I just tried the first one and it was the bomb.com 😁😁😁😁😁
How much have u lost ?
...you should start a drink company with apple cider based drinks and it’s like these drinks lol
Do u drink these before you eat?
Are you Roger Bobb’s  daughter? 😀
is the lemon juice necessary to help make it taste better? I cant seem to find a bottle of lemon juice anywhere in the UK! If there is an alternative/not needed then I'll definetly be using these recipeis!

Honey is all i use
Where did you get your hair from
Are these meant to replace a meal or are they to be consumed prior to eating?
Great Idea!!!
They have stevia drops you can use to sweeten as well that way it’s not gritty 😃
That link does not work...Can you link it here...thx for sharing
Great Video Taylor! I do have a few questions 1. How many ounces of water do you use per drink? 2. Do you cook with ACV or know any recipes? 3. What were the ounces of your plastic bottles?.... sorry for all the questions
💕💕💕💕
wonderful video
whats that power?
short n sweet ve ur video very organize
These look nummy!!!
Do these still help you lose weight since you had sugar and other ingredients?
On my way to the supermarket thanks
Hey girl! Do you drink all 4 a day? Because I want to start😊
How much do you drink a day though? I just started yesterday with your drink. But I feel like I'm not drinking enough apple cider vinegar to help but I don't want to drink too much.
What do you eat with this
Do you keep the ones you are not drinking in the refrigerator until you are ready to drink them?
Fab recipe ideas, I have tried using your ingredients before I saw this video but never thought to blend, must try!  I also found that I didnt loose weight after drinking acv for 3 weeks, I wonder why, any idea? Tfs ♡
I have a question I heard that you go to the bathroom a lot and I work from 7-3
how much did it take for you to see results?
Hi Taylor. What kind of blender are you using?
Thank you so much beautiful queen for sharing this juicing detox recipes💕💕
Can u use alkaline water to make these
fresh  pineapple
Hey girl hey!! Loved this video!  You helped gave me some ideas!! Thank you! But i really like your blender! What brand is it? And where can i buy it?
I also use this Apple cider vinegar. Really helpful. Just subscribed your channel. Keep in touch 😍💕👍😘
I have left over lemons that are about to go bad and I was thinking about buying the ACV drinks, you literally just saved me money! My only suggestion is, heat up your tablespoon of sugar in some water and let it dissolve and then pour it in your drink. Get the sugar without the grit ! Thank you again!
Altho I would only use honey   Not sugar subs they bloat me
This is just what I needed !!!!  Ty
Genius!! When i take the ACV with water in the morning on an empty stomach it always gives me a stomach ache 😖 I definitely think this will help!
Delicious. Thank you!
Thank you... You are life.. You look AMAZING... I CAN'T WAIT TO START
Hello.. What brand stevia are you using and where can I purchase it from?
Thanks for sharing! Do you have an Amazon link for the bottles?
This is an amazing idea❤️
I have a lot of these recipes that I get from Pinterest that are really good and I use different mason jars for my drinks but I on can do 1 a day because I drink the teami tea skinny and colon. Try the sweet sweat stick or cream it's really good for working out. Love your videos
Woww gurl,Thanks for sharing this is really helpful
Notification squad, like#1. I def saw results using this!!! Glad it’s working for you!!
