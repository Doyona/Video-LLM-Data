I still use this in 2024 because of this video. I LOVE it!
I love thus girl ❤
I love this video, and the brushes. 2022
I would only use it to dry brushes honestly. Ain't nobody got time to air dry brushes.
Ml is metric
Neat.
Great demo, thanks
Love to everyone from 2021!
It spins and vibrates😆😆😆😆🤔
Honestly you could just use this to dry the brushes or to quickly clean them throughout the week then do a deep cleaning
I bought that same StylePro brush cleaner from Costco, and it came with a cleaning solution for cream make up. So soap and water for powder and the cleaning solution for cream oil based stuff.
I got this a costco the other day and it works very good. 9 bucks
And using a drop of dawn will really clean them nicely. It is time consuming but the up side is water won’t be running in the sink and they do get them very clean and quickly.
Thing is I don’t like the left over soap so I redo the whole process in just only water so I know all the soap in completely out because I can for sure say following the directions will not get all the soap out. Also any brushes with liquids will have to get washed multiple times.
You can buy these at amazon for $15-35. Thank me later.
The StylPro device, including a bottle of their cleanser, is now available at Costco, for basically $20 USD. Wahoo!
I’m from New York and I saw it at Costco for 19.49 $

It looks like I could get the same result with a electric drill and a fish bowl lol but I love it
u look like neandethal cqavewoman lol
What I learned: 1. It's less expensive to just soak and rinse in soap and water 2. Only deep clean brushes used for creamy products & quick rinse powder brushes 3. Keep your sh*t clean Thank you 😁
Love your channel!! I just did a brush cleaner video myself. I had a little mishap. Bahahaha!
....Damn, had to turn it off after ten seconds. Legit
This is the brush cleaner that I have been wanting so bad but I can't afford it! :(
your voice is obnoxious
i have never seen this girl before but she is crazy like omg so much energy!!!
Couldn't you just use a dremel?
I think your soap is too mild! Maybe you can do the process with a powerful soap, then with your mild one. And personally, I'll do the process with jus plain water for rinsing.
The only useful thing I see about this device is the ability to dry the brushes in seconds, for the cleaning instead I still believe the manual way is better.

u can get it at wish app for like $15 ur welcome:)
I hit the like button I hope it works! I think it did!!
That was too much of a Hassel and took way to long to clean one brush lol. I would have had 3 brushes cleaned by hand in the time it took to clean just 1 brush with that device lol. The only part that I found useful was the spinning and it definitely wasn't worth $80! lol
This is good of you are a makeup artist
Over price
I use baby shampoo on my brushes, works great & it’s cheap!
3:59 gives me life! I had to wake my husband up to see this part 😂
SHE LOOKS SO CUTE HERE
You need to use hot water I think? Great video!
I just got something like this from TJMAXX for $14.99. I can’t wait to try it after watching this! Mine came with minimal strangely worded instructions but you saved me. Love you bunny 💗
Can you see if the Turbo Scrub or something like that works?  It is a battery operated bathtub scrubbers. Thank you so much for your videos. My granddaughter and I get together and binge watch your videos all night. Great quality time!!!
You should see the video Clean Your Makeup Brushes In Seconds!! Stylpro Hayls World. I hope that will help you. See you in church.
Her eyes are the best
you should do a DIY of this using drill
Are those your real eye colour
It seems like it works the best with volatile cleaning solvents instead of soap and water
4 ml= just under 1 tsp.
Is the issue whether the makeup was cream or powder or does the shape of the brush affect how well it cleans?
Damn your eyes are sooo blue its pretty💙😂
i don’t wear makeup but honestly it looks so satisfying to use that I’ll buy it to clean my sisters and moms brushes for them 😂😂
Did I miss seeing you rinse off the dirty water in clear water and then dry?
This is such a scam.
I bought mine from this website here, so much cheaper and its literally a TIME SAVER.  https://sippaway.com/products/electric-makeup-brush-cleaner Can't believe its so easy to clean my brushes using this..I used to dread having to clean my brushes. Now I can easily clean them and use them almost right away!!! 😭😍
Hi bunnie I bought one a few months ago then the rubber collar warps and the brush flys off ! Sounds funny but no when you get covered in dirty water !
I have this
i also like to clean my brushes when im done with them
Especially to use a lot of brushes,like ti it stuff lm lazy to hand wash so matter have no time a have not so hand by)
I like your word "specifical"
2 years later...still using this product?
using things for what they are not supposed to be used for... 😂
Raise your hand if you've never washed your brushes....  🙋‍♀️
Lol love you xxxx brilliant, love n hugs xxxx
I have not constantly watched her videos (like 3 videos in a row) since like 2014 so sad
Didn't even know this existed, now gotta have one.
Definitely WOULD LIKE to see if the SILLISPONGE thingy REALLY WORKS!!! GREAT IDEA!!! Love ur videos,  came across u again today & made sure to put notification on,  because beeen waaaay 2 long... forgot how great ur videos are!!!! So please try testing out the Sillisponge!!!
Does the way she explain the cleaner sound a little dirty to you.........no.........just me ok
Do u still use this. In 2018 ?
I love it I just have an issue with my double sided brushes
Here its cheaper: https://mercatoronline.com/makeupbrushcleaner
Ova je prsla brate...msm da je ovo malo za lecenje
Thing
I think it worked pretty well.
This is the first video I ever liked !
I wonder if you could hand wash brushes that are used with cream makeup and use the spinner thing to just dry the brush
I love you soo much Bunny!!! Some days it may not feel like like it, but we will give you support, and we LOVE YOU!!! WE LOVE WHAT U dO, KEEP DOING ThIS VIDEOS PLZ!! :)
I like how she calls fingers flanges😄😆
I wish I had those eyes😍👀
Have you used this recently???
You can buy this at Walmart for 13.99
If you only use one brush at a time maybe you wouldn't need full amount of soap per brush.

This video should honestly just be about 5 minutes long. But I live for bunny and enjoyed every second.
can i have 1 like please ❤
Wouldn’t you want to rinse to get the soap residue off??? Seems like you’d need two fish bowls - one with soap and one with just water and spin to dry after the water one.
IT does work better with their soap
Love your hair in this
Omg I love u u r so beautiful ! I love your personality and your so pretty!
You are the best 😁😗
3:26 omg that sounds wrong😂😂😂
Post more of these!
I would have liked to see how it works on small eyeshadow brushes cuz it worked so well on the larger types.
I love you bunny !
Zoe Ayla makes one just like it and I got it online from fab fit fun for around $25 and I love it! You can use olive oil (conditions brushes) and any antibacterial soap or this dyi recipe - https://livesimply.me/2015/06/21/homemade-natural-makeup-brush-cleaner/
You could just buy an electric resizeable drill for about $30 though...
Lol amazon has great dupes now ❤️
I want more then 1 scout to subscribe to u deserve more then u get

I love you bunny
I think that uses way less water and soap than just running the tap and cleaning them normally. And looks so easy. 💸💸💸
Even if you're dumping out the water it's still using less water than if you had the sink running and running while you froth and squeeze froth and squeeze trying to get pigment out of the bristles. This thing looks like it uses 250-500ml a brush maybe, depending on size.
I love you so much
For the cream you need to have brush cleaner

Bunny your the best
This looked SO cool!
She reminds me of dory
Figure this out c times π
I was thinking that maybe the cleanser might be the problem with creams.  I think you mentioned that in the end. I'm hoping that is the only problem with the creams. I'm going to try a different brand hoping to get as good or better results at a cheaper price. Which is often not the case. But sometimes. Let's hope.  Thank you for the review.

Better review than jefree starrs review. 😍😘👌
It does say to use a cleanser for liquid/cream products but you could always just do 2 rinses
committee praise though must locate unlike correct scream read OK instead impact.
I wonder if a handheld fan would work, would need to find collar alternatives tho...hmm
I am sort of shocked that they didn't have you run the brushes through clear water to "rinse" them?
I love your hair Bunny
We're do you live
you are the one and only person I trust for true tea Ily
Her reactions between 4:00-4:15 are my absolute favorite. I always crack up and can watch them over and over
I love all your videos you are the best  you tuber
Your eyes are beautiful
She did it very wrong
Thanks Bunny!
You are really pretty and funny
3:07 that reaction to the little wiggly hair in the center xD
i was subscribed since 2014??  why am i unsubscribed now??
I also own and use this tool. One difference though.... is that I wash a handful of  brushes in the soapy water.... and then do a clean rinse in the same bow, l in clear warm water. (Yes, you can use the same soapy water for more than one brush, if you don't have more than a month's worth of powder on them.) Brushes used with liquid or cream products are bit bit more tricky. That's when you may need 2 soapy rounds and then a clean rinse.  (For those kind of brushes I   actually use the cleaning solution from the same company.... and then do one clear rinse, too.)
it works better (and sure cream) with hot water
Hint hint. Smash that like button
Sorry about the thumbs down
this product should be on a satisfying compilation!!!
She talks way too much
I love your vids 💕💗💕💕❤️️❤️️❤️️😍😍😍😍😍
*Your guyses*
you are so funny - really enjoyed your presentation thanks
In your next video do the cup song
I rarely laughed that hard by watching a YouTube video. I simply LOVE your facial expressions. Bunny you're absolutely awesome.
Did you ever think of getting brases
I'd use it but feel like I would havta wash it again in plain water bc of soap residue. I'd definitely use it to dry my brushes though!
Would you consider the brushes dry enough to use close to after washing or wait like a few hours?
Yes
Wouldn’t the end of your brush get ruined cause it might hit the square spinning thingy lol idk
She's crazy i love that 🤣🤣💙
It’s like a car wash
bunny, do i have permission to copy your hair color pattern, like the blonde and the black?
maybe use a different soap for cleaning the brush? and use warm water
Look I don't have hours to watch this stuff stop talking so much I keep having to skip through like more than half just to see what I need to see like on ANY of your videos smfh
Uh. I guess. It looks like it messed up the brush. The shape didn't go back to originally to what they were. I wouldnt use it for a fluffy brush.
🎂🎈🍰👍💜😍 hi 12-4-2017 is my B-Day
We hit the like goal
I love your eyes!!
OMG YES
HER EYES ARE SOOO BLUE
$80??? U can buy on ebay for like £10-15
I would use dawn dish soap. Its a degreaser. It can be used on animals so i would think you could use it on your brushes. More for your foundation brushes.
あなたの目はカラコンですか？
I want one
All the brushes look destroyed though.
Okay yup, I bought one. Mine was only $30 though
Wow ur hair got so long from this video
I think I'd have the same problem with spending a lot of time and water to keep refilling the bowl between brushes, BUT I can totally see washes them the way I normally do and then using this to dry them!
It’s so weird cause I watched a video where jeffreestar and Laura Lee did it and it didn’t work
BALIW😏
Hey guys!!   I am giving away 10 FREE units of this makeup brush cleaner in exchange for reviews. Within US only.   Please send me an email: beautysynergysg@gmail.com for details! :) Rest assured this is a genuine offer!
Don't know what's different, but you look really pretty in this vid.. I mean you always do but you look prettier
I've literally only JUST seen ads for this product in Australia yet this video is almost a year old :( Some times the world really does treat Australia like a giant country town. It can't possibly take a whole year to release a new product here.
Hello can I ask you a question
Ughhhhh! This thing drives me nuts! What about the part of the process when you rinse off the soap!!!???
Ok is anyone else terrified of Graveyard Girl
Mine is my holy grail
I have this product and when I wash my brushes I use the same soapy water for 2 brushes but I also have an extra bowl of warm clean water on the side to rinse. Basically do the same steps on both soapy then clean water.  Works really well.
I love u bunny I wasn't felling well today and you always make me smile and laugh....💜
4:00 😂😂
She starts at 1:05
2:21 youre welcome
i love her eyes!
2:13
;) good vid
Can bunny get a blue check mark?
18:07 check it out
Since when we're u begging for likes?
I'm getting this for my birthday and I just wanted to make sure it was worth ordering and after watching this I'm so excited to get it!!!
Wow, wonder if that thing could be used with paint brushes. May have to give it a go just to see.
cool bunny
Watching Bunny cheers me up so much 😄
You make my life so much easier.
Love your hair!!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder if you could add baking soda to the solution with concealer flat brushes to get it clean.  Thanks for the video.  You've popped up in other YouTube searches but this is the 1st time watching!  You are a crack up!
Does anyone think that she should die her hair again 😍
The fuh rule??? It's pronounced feral
I got one and it works perfectly
i love bunny and i have bright blue eyes to
This eyes😵
hi i am a deal sharer and i know there is a Codream Makeup brush cleaner and i have bought one from them it's very convenient and cleaning brush is no big deal:) no advertise, i just want to share great something to peopel, more love
I literally pee my pants when she spinned the brush around and there was a stray hair poking in the middle.   Really....I peed...literally peed.   I laughed entirely too hard at that.
Can you please watch my videos
You have so cute eyes😲
The spin brush cleaner looks like it spins the brushes out of wack like they lose shape just after one use.
That Murad cleanser burned my face and gave me red blotches on my cheeks.
"oh, did you think the product was in there?" dont judge a book by it's cover 😂
Nice highlights!!
I could see this being a lot more cost effective if you use this every time you do your make up, as the water might not be so dirty, you might not need to waste so much. I see a lot of people using this after their brushes are super dirty. Maybe even have one bowl for the initial clean and another to "rinse?"
@grav3yardgirl i love the sippy sippy part in ur videos so much
Your eyes are pretty I am a girl
I literally cannot stand her and I'm pissed that there was so many ads lmao never again
The like button doesn't work sadly, I broke it :(
I feel like this thing could use LESS water, even if you change it after each brush. Think about how much water you can use cleaning old foundation out of a brush or really pigmented eye shadows off brushes.
specifical lol
no sippy sippy?
Your hair looks green
😚😚😚😚😚
I feel like over time it will destroy your brushes
She is crazy she screams a lot
3:57 👌😂
Omg your eyes are so blue 💙💙
Am I crazy or her eyes was changing colors
I just saw you in an ad for the spinning brush cleaner... https://www.facebook.com/realtechtimenews/videos/412845592450484/
This girl is crazy
I want to know where she bought that shirt/sweater 😻😻😻
DIKKAT GÖRGÜSÜZ ICERIR YAZISINI EKLESEYDIN KEŞKE OMG 💩💩💩

what iv learned is that makeup can stain your brushes
To much
I bought mine on Amazon for $19.98
Why are you screaming? Reminds  me of Carrot  Top's sister 😥

ok doll now thats its been a year would you still say this is a good buy???
And here's me washing my brushes twice a year
omg your reaction the first time you spin the brush 😂😂😂
You didn't miss that class. I didn't learn the metric system in school either.
you've made a much better review than jef & laura
Bunny:Now they say start to spin *Gets excited because of the spinning* *Ad plays without the skip option* Me: why
WARNING DON'T watch her if u have a headache other than that DO!
Am I the only one who thought about dropping that stlypro vibrating stick thingy "on accident " on my lap between my legs but like not meaning to though just "on accident " 😏
I LOVE U AND ALL but u need to brush your teetg
I wonder if it would be terrible just to put a drop of soap on the bristles and then spin in clean water.
People in my family call me bunny, cause I'm jumpy and can do the nose thing just lik a bunny
She is Bug eyed and creeps me out... also what is she on?!!
I feel like it would work even better if the glass bowl was textured.
Bunny: *Talks like she's crazy and ends up flipping hair over her head and into her face*  Bunny: *proceeds to talk this way looking even more crazy*  😂😂😂 luv u gurl!
It's not a farul it's a farrreell
She's creepy to me but she's funny and fun

Has anyone tried the Luxe Makeup Brush cleaner?
these are under $20 on ebay
Random quick comment, actually 70-75% rubbing alcohol is better at sterilization than 95%.
omg it's amazing I need one asap lol
You always can make me happy and laugh!! LOVE YOU BUNNY
I bought a dupe of this online, and it didnt work, so I just let my fish swim in it when I change his water

SUCH BEAUTIFUL EYES, I have been watching since 100 subs
I don't know why but I could watch brushes being cleaned with this thing all day it's so mesmerizing
I love watching all these make up related vids but I prefer to be natural most of the time. No makeup at all. Nothing better than just letting your skin breath
I wonder if this would work for paint brushes
you are amazing bunny... :) I'm your fan from philippines.. :)
um sorry but no offence but in think you should go to the um uhh never mind you p perfect ish I guess
omg Jen is sub to you
hmm, immediately skipped forward to see what this was and she said "collars on my phalanges". You got my like
Brush cleaning hack 4 bunny: use hot glue to put bumps, lines, etc. on a rubber glove, put soap on the glove, run a brush under water, then rub the brush on the bumps, it will help clean it out
I love Bunny... So! Much!
she bathes in murad :DD
remember when she did magic cleaning bush robot first impression
remember when she did magic cleaning brush robot does it really work
You get so much money😍😍😂
She's more popular than jake and Logan Paul with the subs
its a car wash for brushes lol
love your videos
"Most people probably don't OOUUUGHHHHHH"...this is why I'm a subscriber!!!! XOXOXO BUNNY!!!!
Im 11 and I have been watching you since I was 5.  you're really inspiring when I come home from school and i had a bad day at school I watch videos and the make me happy again.I wish I could send stuff to you but in not allowed. THANK YOU FOR BEING THE BEST YOUTUBER !!!!!!!THX
I use brush cleaner from Bare Minerals. The makeup literally drips off the brush when you lather it up. Nothing better IMO.
6:42 pronounced as "feral"
I want one!!
IM LAUGHING SO HARD IM CYING I LOVE YOUR FIRST REACTION TO THE SINNING BRUSH AND THE VERY END! xDDD
when she first plugged the brush in and switched it on! 😂😂 that face!!! 😂😂😂
#NOTIFICATIONSQUAD #BUNNYLOVE #KEEPDOINGYOU&YOUONLY
grav3yardgirl yes please
this looks awesome
99% alcohol dries up faster than it kills the germs. Get the 70% and it will work long enough to kill all the germs on your brushes. =)
pleaseeeee do a video applying your makeup with the brush spinning!
you are the bestttttttttttttt!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
is that your eyecoler?
i luv this video i have watched it 30plus times lol
it's not too bad to change out the water, it still uses less than washing them under running water
LOVE...YOUR...Videos..............❤❤❤💛💛💛💚💚💚💙💙💙💜💜💜💖💖💖
🐰 is the best
are u ADHD
They seem so new once  you clean them durring the process.
So wait, you don't rinse off the soap from the brushes?  Do you not need to do that and I've been adding a step all this time?  Just seems weird that you'd just let it soak in soapy (and eventually dirty) water then just go on to dry and use it.
mild,  cheap soapy water.  all brushes use that solution.  but each brush fresh, plain water for "rinse cycle ".
I really X2 love your eyes
i think it only works on more circular brushes since to clean them the bristles have to fly outward with centripetal force so flat brushes would just be harder to clean
You are a character for sure.  Should be an actor.  You are good.
Have u been using this apparatus after this vid????????
" little brush friends" 😊
you should do a candy curl with makeup brushes
i went to Starbucks and got some sweet tea and sadly i was too happy cuz i didn't have a Starbucks in ages  it is so unfortunate but...  MY SWEET TEA FELL ALL OVER ME!😦😥😦
u r so funny and I love you grav3yardgirl!!!!😄😄😄
i wonder if she still uses it :)
did dogman and bunny break up??

Can you make a a video on the acne vacuum thing? I feel like it's too good to be true but idk
Anyone know how to replicate this without spending about $80? Looking for a friend
yea your supposed to dump the water
Still my favorite video EVER 😆
bunny i think the liks button works (hah i Am not funny)
who was completely obsessed with her eyes?
she's scared me she might eat me any moment :(
Dunno about anyone else but when I wash my brushes I probably use more soap and water than what this device does, especially giving it a final rinse I trend to do it under a running tap...
"Your dirty little brush friends" hahahahahahahha I love that that's amazing
tienes una cara de loca que no puedes con ella
works better for flat if water bit warm also just put a bit of alcohol in water too and no need change water as much
just hold brush between hand and then put in water then spin between hands while in water and soap wola clean
i hate that stores and  products in usa dont ship to uk
Can someone please do a diy of this
I want it
There's too much water 💦 you need to put a little bit less water. I llove that product. 😁 awesome tutorial!!! Love your vids❤
Yes please
Do Rocky Mountain tumbler
I wonder if laundry soap would work in smaller amounts (<1mL per bowl of water)? It seems to be the best at removing gross human oils and whatnot in my experience. It also comes in free and clear formulas for skin sensitive folks.
just dying LOL
this is cool
;-)
love your hair color
At 7:33 The brush is about to spin skip to that time your welcome
😂😂😂😂 does the like button really works? 😂😂
grav3yardgirl I don't know what that is but I will say yes 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
DO MORE DOES THIS THING REALLY WORKS
just wondering how long yours took to ship to you? I purchased mine a week ago and am so excited to use it! 😊
hi
Heyyy @grav3yardgirl please do a video on LipSense!!!! Let me know if you need a kit sent out to you!
I finally ordered this. I hate cleaning all my brushes... Cant wait to actually have it in my hands.
I don't even use make up yet I still want to buy this😂
I'm delayed😜 use antibacterial soap.
I'm going to use that
what batteries does it require and are they included? can anyone tell me im getting this in 8 days for my birthday and ill be gutted if i cant use it cause i have no batteries hahaahah
do the vamp stamp!!!!!!
grav3yardgirl I use shampoo and conditioner on my brushes,so I don't have to buy any extra special soap for my brushes. Everyone uses what works for them. I want to get this device,if it dries the brush that fast. I'd need to rinse out the brush well then spin dry it afterwards. God bless you hun
sorry i unsubsribed it was not very entertaining
Did anyone else had a problem ordering this item??
i love you so so soooo much
I am also Holo sexual 💅🐊
My boyfriend found something like this on Amazon and the only reason he got it for me was because I told him (and maybe made him) watch this video. I love using it and it cleans my brushes so well :) Thanks for all you do on your channel!
I love you 💟
i just watch it till she says " does this thing really work?"
Cool I'm definitely liked this video
Maybe use warm water for cream?
this thing is cool

Are her eyes really that blue?
Yes the like button really works
k
omg were did you get that
Omg the thumbnail :/
Please try the Makeup Hacker from Mink. It is a diy custom color pigment mixer. Create any color you want!
I don't wear makeup but I would buy this just to clean my mom and sister brushes. I like things like this
So is there like a hole in the bottom of the brush like how does it make the brush spin
I think I would only want this for the drying feature. I prefer to just use a bar of soap to clean my makeup brushes. I also use bar soap to clean my beauty blender, which I clean daily.
Hahahah oh my god I just had to pause at 4:08 and laugh for a few minutes! Love you bunnyyy
I was watching this video and my cousin joined me. she's only 4 and started crying because she thought you were scary😂😘
wonder if dove dish soap would be better? it's what they use to get oil of duckies.
I love it!
IT WORKS BETTER WITH WARM WATER
Quote: "Legion of Youtubers!" LOL
I CUT MY HAIR AND DYED IT PURPLE BLUE GREEN FOR YOU
Psycho 😂
Hiii bunny
When I got my first makeup brush it was from Claire's and I was in 4th grade. I washed it for the first time 2 years later, it was so dirty that the bristles were clumped together in groups😂. I didn't wash it sooner because I didn't know you were supposed to wash makeup brushes😂😂😂.
try dawn its a degresser for the liquid make up
you should fill a jug with water and soap so its faster to change the water
Maybe if you use hot water when you clean the cream concealer brushes it might work better. Since it takes hot water to get grease off of dishes, it may need the hot water to clean the cream brushes.
Love you bunny.
Am I the only one wondering if you rinse them after the soap run? They still have soap in them after the spin....
im a poop face
Hi
You are so cool😂❤
I DARE you to apply ur makeup with the Spinny thingy
I really want that cuz my brushes are probably really dirty
That device looks great!
I think we did it. :) 2,491,501 views

Wondering if this could work with paint brushes too 🤔😏☺️
Wait.. people wash their brushes another way than a bowl of water and soap.. with doing it that way too you have to empty the bowl each time
How can someone be sooo pretty? Omg I'm in love w/ your eyes and hair and face and everything!!
The intro will never change
No ones talking about it, but I'm curious. Did Bunny and Dogman get married??? I noticed her wearing the 2 rings now and I'm kind of hoping!!!
were did you get it
i love your videos so much
ur eyes are the most beautiful blue
love you buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I need it !!😮 wow it's cleans them well
you are awesome
hi
is it ok I'm bothered the soap isn't rinsed off
where have you been where are you NOW? like in 2017 February
use warm water in a bowl dip your brushes and all the make up comes off
I ordered mine last month and it hasn't come yet. I really wanna try it. has anyone had problems with shipping? if so please help.
Eyes tho
It's too expensive wtf
Does anyone know what kind of brush she used the first time...that green color one
I love you I was grounded so I couldn't watch you so I smile when I got to see your face ❤️😍😘😎💩
how old is she
Damn, you odious.
WHY IS THIS SO SATISFYING
Hey Bunny can you test the too faced white chocolate chip palette or the peach liquid lip sticks?
OMG Bunny! I feel so filthy right now! I have never ever washed my make up brushes before!
3:58 xD xD xD
I would use jabón zote
This was awful and just all-around unpleasant to watch!!
Grav3yardgirl hahah your reaction when it first starts spinning the brush!
I love how real bunny is 😂
Could I please get some likes on this comment for my birthday 💗
what happened to your sippy sippy "ahhhhhh"
meow
You have me in stitches! Ahahahaa too funny! Great review btw!
I do think it works!!🙂🙂
I think the reason it doesn't have a line to fill to is because the different brush sizes require different amounts of water.
HIMIRROR REVIEW
almost at 8 milion
I will use thise to make soy-latte macchiato....
Watching you makes me so calm and safe feeling!
Maybe instead of the water you can use rubbing alcohol. Just so your not like EK GERMS AND CRAP
Who else does the intro along with bunny? ...... no just me okay
ok this is random, but does anyone else feel like green/teal hair would suit her a lot?
bunny I love you ur so funny XX
Bunny your eyes are Mesmerising
Why are you so perky
WHEN SHE FUCKIN TURNS IT ON AND IT STARTS SPINNING (3:59) IM DYING OH YMG OD HER FACE
Ml is a way of measuring things in England. Nearly everything is measured in ml
Is it me or is bunnies hair green?
who thinks there should be a beauty  blender cleaning machine
who watches this because watching the brushes look satosfying
i love u and this vid was amazing
I know I'm a little late but lmaoooo @3:58 I just about died from laughing too hard!!
won't it be too harsh for the brush to spin like that and destroy the shape?
Your brushes are soooooooo clean yaaaaaaassss
This video was posted on my birthday. WHY AM I BARELY SEEING THIs
My god she's loud xD
bunny! please test Sanfilippo Wing it! it's a liner with wing stamp!
. . . I kinda want this for my paint brushes. >u> . . .
You could clean all the dirty brushes one after another and than dump out the water and put fresh and wash again than on the third round use clean water no soap. it seems bad to leave the soap in the brush.
I feel like I should buy this for my sister cause she is very sceptical of her make up brushes being clean. Thank you Bunny your the best😘😘😘
Maybe warm water with cream make up?
the like button works! time for 'DOES THE SUBSCRIBE BUTTON REALLY WORK?'
ya totally do it you rock and this isn't sarcasm my profile picture isn't friendly
Her eyess 😱😍are life 💦💦
Its £49.99 in the UK..
your my bae
anyone know where she got her sweater??
If you compare the amount of water and soap you would use to clean your brushes traditionally (in the sink) to the amount in this fish bowl you would have to change the water 5-10 times to even come close to the normal amount! Especially with the big ones. I'm totally sold on this.
What brush is tha first one I want one
(•_•)/ <)_)  /  \
this video was awesome and  crazy and cool I watch you every day you have to make videos forever pretty please😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌
This is the video that made me hit subscribe!! I've been in love ever since! Your charisma is undeniable and so addicting. I love your channel 💕💕
I would use a bigger container so you wouldn't have to change the water between every use. I think it would be quicker.
I love how she pronounces the metal part... the ferrule?  😂
The one discrepancy I do have is that is seems so impractical.
Omg she's like my aunt's doppelgänger it's wigging me out😂
to clean cream products from brushes i recomend using some oily thing (baby oil)- oil dissolve all cream products and they come out very fast :)- just add some oil to mixture of water and soap :)
Hey bunny you are the best and my dream was for you to answer me and talk to you just wanted to tell that your awesome
Your awesome lol do you guys like it like if you do
So basically a diy hack would be a dremmel and a fish bowl?
it bothers me that they aren't rinsed.
everyone has to click the bell between the word subscribed and the number of subscribers. This will ensure you get bunny's videos. youtube is just making things complicated. Love ya bunny
Yes
are you going to di a does it curl again
are you going to di a does it curl again
I would wash mine the old fashion way I always do and I'd use that to dry my brushes. Waiting overnight for my giant fluffy brushes don't dry them completely for me to use them in the morning
Her first reaction 😂😂😂
wow i love your videos. bunny i love you and your amazing
you are okay
u guys can u any type of oil to cleen your makeup brushes... olive oil coconut oil cooking oil any type of oil 💞welcome💖
she drank to much coffee
Super cool!! I bet this would also be great for artists' paint brushes!!
Bunny's eyes❤️❤️❤️😩😩😩😩
When something is finally from the uk 🙌🏻😂
Where did she buy the first brush???
I thought she uploaded this before
Please try blendy pens!
Are you adhd
Bunny do you continue using these kinds of things that you approve. Love your videos
I LOVE YOU
what a stupid  chanel
who els does the intro with bunny x!??
bunny I just wanted to say I watch a lot off youtubers and you are my far my favirote because you do all the videos I love and make it funny and I love you so much thanks for doing youtube and just being here xxx
applying makeup with that thing should be a challenge :)
Why not pre-mix 16 to 32 Oz. Purified Water and Soap (Dawn) so you don't spend so much and rinse brushes in clean water or Alcohol after washing?
Yes, if you are makeup artist with clients, good idea.  But if you are a 16 yr old student, nevermind.  BTW, many products on YT are for Makeup artists, who will get their money's worth from 'clients' but not for general consumers. Be wise when you buy, even if you are rich.  There are just too many junks for the landfill.
I wonder if warm water would clean it even better. (The concealer brush.)
Can I get 14 likes? For no reason? No? K.
That's so satisfying
I don't know why but she should not have to act to act like a crazy perks she is actually naturally beautiful
you should do a video on brush and beauty blender cleaning. what you use, pintrist and instrgram hacks.  I use a soap and olive oil trick i picked up on pintrist. quick and easy. curious if thereis a better way and if there isa reason not to use it.
( ; 0 ;) |-------~| Help him move the bed by clicking the thumbs up!
What brushes was she cleaning??
I tried the like button and I does really work! :D
😆😆😄😄😂😂
Would like to see a video of your cleaning process! For brushes and beauty sponges 😘
You could always have a small pot/bucket to dump out the water and have fresh water ready saves getting up between brushes 😊 looks fab I need one! I'm in UK 🇬🇧 so I'll check out amazon x
I NEED THIS OH MY GOD
grav3yardgirl  my daughter and I love watching all of your videos but we love the does this thing really work videos the most we both say the beginning intro DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK! Together I honestly would love to watch more of these with her but we have watched all of them already please make more I know you have one coming out this weekend and we are waiting but we so wish there were more
+grav3yardgirl Couldn't you use the brushes with cream makeup on the sigma mat & then use this product to quickly dry the brushes? I wonder if after you use it in soapy liquid if you could use them in clean water before drying & then dry them if that would make them even more clean or if that is against the directions? I am a huge fan of yours and have you subscribed and watch you with both my accounts. I have your book, and I love you and Dogman. You inspire me so much. Keep up the good work, and just know you are not alone. I have depression & anxiety as well. I am currently recovering from a broken neck and two neck surgeries as all of this happened over the holidays (I spent Christmas and New Years in the hospital, I fell though before Thanksgiving and slowly lost the ability to walk, feed myself, etc.) and am currently almost all better in a rehab facility. I am away from my family, and thankfully get to see them, but never been away from my little one for so long...ever and well it has been hard on her and all of us. You help me smile., and i would love to reciprocate. LOVE TO ALL THE SWAMP FAMILY! HUGS!
Okay I love Bunny and her videos but does anyone else wish she would go back to doing her old "Does This Thing Really Work?" videos because she used to test fun products like the wubble bubble, balloon banaza, phantom saucer, juggle bubbles, etc.. (Stuff you actually wondered if it worked) I feel like now her videos are unboxing beauty products or testing out beauty products on "Does This Thing Really Work?"
Am I the only person that got life by hearing Bunny say #Bless? Lmao #ILoveIt
to me sharing wash water would be fine if there was a RINSE
Your eyes are beautiful.
this video starting is 6:30
Great! Awesome video I found Stylpro Brush Cleaner on ebay: http://www.ebay.com/itm/182415739507 I will totally buy this!! They ship worldwide
U R SO WEIRD!
So cute it's like a mini washing machine for ur brushes :3
You get this thing and this thing and attach this thing to this thing then you get the thing and put the thing in the other thing and then turn the thing on then stick the thing in the fishbowl thing and clean the brush thing and then you have a clean thing 😂😀
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS EDIT YOUR EYES!
Over 240k Likes! 😆
I just love you Bunny! This series is awesome and I get upset when other YouTubers "TRY" to copy you! Yours is the best, most entertaining, and honest reviews/impressions on the entirety of the internet! Thank you Bunny & keep 'em coming!
We got the video to 200k+ lol 💗
for my peace of mind I'd have to rinse out the soap then I could spin dry it :)
I wish my eyes where as blue as hers :-:
My styl pro does not work at all.  Came dead,  doesn't spin.  I'm so agitated with overseas customer service
i hop you have a good day
To me, rinsing with clean water is the most important step. Without it I feel that my brushes aren't really clean and the soap residue will make me break out.
any small youtubers that wud like to support each other? The BEST OF LUCK 4 everyone!
Are her eyes real? They are freaking beautiful one time in school I got made fun of for having brown eyes 😐
I miss da sassy bun song
Ive been watching u for 3 or 4 years
Hi
Cleaning my foundation brush is daily hell
You are so funny! I really enjoy watching your videos. You totally inspired me to make my own DIY version of this device. Do check it out if you can.
I use dish soap, vinegar, and water for my brushes and they come out super clean every time. Could you possibly do anything video using this product while adding vinegar? It only would need about a teaspoon.
Wow ok! I clean my makeup brushes obviously very half assed then. If this level Of germaphobia is the norm! I just spray a couple sprays of make up sponge cleanser on the blender and squeeze a few times then rinse and even if I still see some make up, I just dry it and keep using it, and I never get pimples at ALL, not even one. Brushes I do not think I have cleaned mine in 3 months with anything more than plain hot water. Sheesh
It's past 200,000 likes! 😄
I almost died of laughter when she first turned it on with the brush attached
I died laughing at her reaction to her brush spinning 😂😂😂😂
I see  this on Facebook
Eyes ❤️
Why does she talk SOOO loud?
yes   queen
omg yassssssss😁
I haven't been here in so long! Does she still do the sippy sippy thing?
I love her personality she's very pretty and sweet and hilarious god bless her can I please get 1 like it will really make my day because my grandmother passed away last Tuesday I really miss her I would never let her go for the whole world I really hope I see her in heaven she was my goal in life sorry for the drama but I really miss her so so so so so so much 😢😢😢😢😢
Please try Chameleon Pens
you're nutz... I like u🤗
i really can watch this a hundred times more bc ui love thiiiiiiiiiisss!!!
Stop trying to make turn your account in to a beauty account!! There's to many of those already !!!😫
I like it 👌🏽👌🏽
Won't this really damage the brush shape after a few uses though? Even if you aren't 'smashing' the brushes, putting them under that much centrifugal force time ofter time must weaken it.
I love her eyes colour. .how can I turn my eyes as blue as like that? she had a blue eyes right? or I just blind..
i just love that bunny talks so clearly cause being able to read captions when you need to be quiet is amazing
Ive been here sense day 14 of DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK! It was great
wait until she gets 1,000,000 likes
Went she put the brush above the water, it looked like an angel!
look at her brush at 4:10
I love you bunny
So you don't rinse it at all?
so awsome bunny you need a Grammy for being you.You are the most funniest person I ever watched on youtube  I wish you have the best day ever lots of hugs from the entire swamp family hugs love,all the swamp family
maybe rinse the brushes before using the soap water so it doesn't get so dirty.
Ohh my gawrdddd I bought one of these BC of your video 😂😂😂
bunny where is the Boyfriend Does My Makeup Video!!??
you are the Best i love you as a fan
It is still using less water then just running under the sink... right...?
Though this was almost a month ago, I still haven't seen any silisponge reviews because I'm waiting for Bunny to release hers. (so if you haven't already filmed a review, gets ta work, bunz. ily)
Can you show us on snapchat cleaning a brush you typically use for foundation? something more tightly packed and dense?
Ok...i'm from the U.K and i thought this was an American product!! Im pissed at myself...s'cuse me whilst i go kick myself to the shop to buy one!
Just use legos.
i think it would be loads better to just do a small amount of cleaner mixed with water, like a water bottle full. then you just pour a lil in for each brush.
doesn't ship to Canada... 😣😢😭
I feel like the leftover residue is due to the fact that the device doesn't specify to rinse the brush after spinning it in the soapy water.
You need help Lmao
Like this way more than the space egg one. Smaller to store, dries the brushes, and I wouldn't be scared of it damaging them.....also am I the only one who doesn't wash beauty blenders and just buys new ones?
Its my 14th birthday can I get 14 likes?🎉
This was amazing!!! I think I could watch it all day
At 4:24 I was like "omg, best part!!" Haha
I died laughing when she said "does the like button really work!" 😂
Cool. this is one of the few "does this thing really work things I might buy xD
Please do the sillisponge!!!! Ilysm
Is it just me that says "Does this thing really work?" with Bunny?     Nope just me? Ok...
the phrase you're looking for is "disinfected." Not "sterilized." I use isopropyl alcohol as well :)
#draintheswamp... Sorry I couldn't find a more perfect opportunity to make a trump joke....
I don't like your hair like this
I am the same way when I clean any thing I can't was dishes or clothes or anything till I clean the sink and washet
OMG YOUR EYES ARE SO PREETY
YOU HAVE TO TRY HI MIRROR PLEASE LOOK UP THE YOUTUBE ADD OMG
you should look at the website VAT19.COM
!!! Got so scared when one of the brushes went too far in the water. Don't get the metal wet! It eats up the glue and you get shedding! This device is so cool but I would get so scared about it ruining the glue when you're spinning in the water.
I would wash all brushes in the first liquid then rinse in a new set of liquid
CONGRATS TO ALMOST EIGHT MILLION
can u do bf does my voice  over
have you realized that your eyes glow when yo do a video?😆😆
Bunny you can also use baby wash if it's good for a baby it's good for your face
Anyone else feel like she's gotten better at reading the instructions? Obviously not like pro status but at least amateur status 😆
Maybe using hot water would be better.
Her eyes are so vivid in this video they almost look purple.....
you are the stupidst and crazyst people I've ever seen
WTF
What do likes do to help a YouTuber?
omg I can't wait for mine to come! ur awesome bunny!!
To clean my brushes I simply put a small amount of vinegar and dish soap in a cup of water. Then, I just swirl my brushes in the cup and rinse them off. This method works well and cleans out all of the chunkiest and most glittery pigments hiding in your brush.
Love you bunny can I have a shoutout please
your funny and pretty I subdscribed
I don't get why u were makeup your pretty without it
Can you do a makeup collection video plssssssss and I love you soooo much
looks like a cool product! xo from my channel to your’s <3
You could wash a few brushes with the same water and them wash them once more with clear water or alcohol...?
I love you so much
you Are scary
Your pretty
The force is so strong it makes the water and soap rise up to touch more than the bristles so what's the point?
why would 2000 people not like this? what's not to like . I love the way you review products bunny, just like a normal person would and not scripted and fake 🐊🐊🐊
I just reviewed this product on our channel! Check it out if you would like 😄
@luxebp on IG sells it for $50.
wow wtf bunny youre just gonna start askin for likes? thats a new low😒
I have this ❤❤❤❤
"Does the like button really work?!" ... I totally lost it, and busted out laughing. So good.
for your cream products bunny, use dawn, then because you have sensitive skin, repeat with the murad after.
Nice hair at 1:24
how much did it cost
grav3yardgirl Can you possibly do a review on the Midi Fighter? It's a little button keypad that lights up pretty colors and plays tones to create music. There's a few YouTube vids but not many reviews from real people. (I'm interested in seeing it played just for a bit of creative fun, it looks cute)
Bunny, i got this cleaning system and i got a free cleaner from the same company with it, powder brushes clean with soap and water but the cream makeup doesnt, it cleans in the company cleaning solution. Maybe try first washing the cream makeup brushes in a brush cleaner and then clean with murad :)
WOW!!! I need that in my life!!😮 Try adding a bit of alcohol to the soap and water, I think it would work better.... 😉
When Bunny says "this thing" and you still feel you understand her😂
Was gonna get it but it's £85 with £9 delivery :(
i heard you say you use alcohol to sterilize your brushes.just to let you know, rubbing alcohol does not sterilize whatever you put it on, it just creates an environment where bacteria cant breed. I thought alcohol sterilized an area to, until i started taking insulin shots and my doctor told me alcohol dont work like that. thing that sterilize are bleach and Lysol. those state it sterilizes on the container.
this is awesome, but what concerns me is that the brushes don't get rinsed, they just get the soapy water spun out. I would think soap residue would be an issue for not only your skin but possibly how your makeup works
she looks like a stereotypical British person
I love you eyes
HOT water for creme makeup residue
anyone else get an ad popping up at 7:20?
dont think it will clean the artis brushes :-(
62.60 yeesh, but then you use your own soap and no pimples.....might be worth it and the cream make up that part concerns me cause isnt that like perfect breeding ground for bacteria??
(°--°)___> my failed attempts at lenny ;-;
Omg I just started watching you and I've been binge watching all day . You are awesome
honestly I didn't think this would work at all, but it did . Wow!
BUNNY, YOU ARE SO MUCH FUN. WE LOVE YOU!😆❤💙💚💛💜👍
Hot water might work better for the brushes having liquid makeup on them.
Yes you should
3:59 OMFG I ALSP GOT SURPRISED HAHAHAHA LMAO
I am happy to give u my like (A high privilege!! JK) but can someone please tell my WHY bunny needs the likes to help out her vids. U GET MY LIKE CAUSE BUNNY IS AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL AND JUST CRAZY FUNNY!! GO SWAMP FAM!
Bunny:"uh look at all this dirt in this water."  You do your makeup with dirt?😂
why no one mentioned herbal essences shampoo for cleaning brushes? one of the best if not best of the best.
It's kinda like a fan 😂
try the pin were you have to draw something before the led goes in plzzz
This one works better than the egg looking brush washing machine you tried! This one leaves your brushes mostly dry. The other they have to dry overnight. I can't help but think that like the clothes in the washing machine if you leave them wet overnight it will get mildewy. This one leaves them dryer and seems more sanitary and FASTER! 👍🏽
HA HA HA 😂😂😂😂😂😂  😛😛😛😛😛😈😈😈😹😹
You should try the eyeliner stamp
what's up with the new like stuff? can someone explain.  I dont get it
i seriously held my breath for a sec when she threw the box. haha
hey bunny u have more than 200k likes lol ♡♡♡
They don't ship to Canada D: I want that so badly!
I just use a $1 bar of soap to clean my brushes 😂 I struggle man, you do what you gotta do when you struggle.
I like your hair the colors go great together and the colors look good on you
Count right away
She did it for about 20 seconds each time
Lady Gaga
why dose it take 18 minutes to review a product
You made me lol next to my sleeping hubby!! When you first made the brush spin. Aaaahahaha it was hilarious.
washing brushes under tab water use more water than this bowl ... so don't worry about changing the water...
She's creepy
wait I have spmetjing to say     DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I've never seen or heard of you before.  I'm not into makeup.  You are awesome and beautiful.  I got here accidentally looking for a makeup brush cleaner for my wife.  Stay awesome!
I wish I had this. I'm still pretty new to makeup and I feel like I messed up this one fluffy brush that I have by hand washing it :(
what if you took all your dirty brushes and ran them thru the soap without changing then do a second rinse cycle with all of them and see what happens
I APPRECIATE EVERYSINGLE ONE OF U *LIKES*
so cool and amazing
She's so weird I love it
This was real fun Bunny! Thanks!😀
I love your videos your so funny
Try dish soap for your cream brushes. I know it doesn't sound safe, but drag queens swear by dish soap taking off layers of make-up in one go, so just something to think on :)
Pls do an as seen on tv thing you haven't done it in so long
I actually thought the product was in the box when you threw the box got a mini heart scared 😁
those eyes those 😍
I feel like I use a ton of water when I clean my brushes, I don't mind the dumping out and refilling the bowl
i about lost it at her reaction at 4:08 when it started spinning and the brush got flat 😭😂😂😂😂
You could just make a mixture of coconut oil and baby shampoo to clean your brushes it works rlly well
"You're not supposed to just- OOOOOOH!!" Dead within a few mins already
ozarka water <3
lol, she said "ferr-oool," not "fair-el"
It still bugs me because it seems like the water will get in the ferrule with how much the water flies up. But like you said that could be the soap you used that made it so sudsy.
I love bunny but does this really need to be 18 minutes long?
can u do a tour of your new house
Hey guys! Can I get 10 likes for no reason 😂 😂 😂
love the runforthecube language. 😃😍👍
I like your hair  this way
you should do a give away with this product
4:00 - 4:15 her reaction is priceless... I laughed so hard 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tapes makeup brushes to a power drill in a bucket of water*  Brush washing mission COMPLETE✔✔
hi
I wonder if you should do a rinse, wouldn't the soap leave residue. just a thought
Get the angry mama microwave cleaner
Can you please do more hair products that your trying out they are my favourite grav3yardgirl
Did you know that they is something that checks if the like button turns blue and guess what it actually works
I love 🐊 so much
why is her hair blue????
this would be nice I guess if you need to clean your brush and use it again right away but I personally just take a weekend when I'm not doing anything and set it aside to make sure each of my brushes get the care they need without spending $80 on a whole separate device.
can you try the smashbox insta-matte?!
hey bunny.. you what you should try out ?  the SiliSponge!!!! #SiliSponge #DiRW #Grav3YardGirl
How did I end up here I hate her she acts like a 9 year old
(Y) silisponge!!!!
❤️🐊👑
If this was more affordable I would try it.
I LITERALLY HAVENT WATCHED YOUR VIDEOS IN A YEAR AND IVE MISSED HOW BUBBLY AND EXCITING YOU ARE
I love the colour in your hair 😍 and how your hair looks omg ❤🔥
I LOVE you! hahaha you're so funny. so I'm thinking, what if you wash them all in the same water once, then dump out the water & give them all a 2nd wash. & then pour your 90% alcohol & guve them all a quick last spin... so it's 3 washes, but it's better than dumping out product every single time. i have like 50 brushes hahahaha what do u think?
Id love her to do a collab with Liza Koshy
I keep getting unsubbed from you ;-;
So what's the difference between this and a screwdriver??
😂😂😍💜😍 the legion of youtubers
Who's watching this on 2017?????✌🏻️😂❤️
hey we are trying to get out channel up and going we are new you tubers and it would be amazing if you guys would follow 😂😊😊thanks so much if you do
Love iy
since i started using brushes for make up (couple years now) iv been using a dermal and small bowlof water to do the same thing.
That thing is pretty cool!
u should do asmr sometime
2017 youtube trend: begging for likes
Could this work FOR paint brushes??
is nobody going to mention her face at the end😂😂
It seems like the only automated brush cleaner that actually works.
u should try the dr bronners pure castille soap! i was so shocked at how easy it was to dissolve the makeup...plus its great to use if u have sensitive skin:)
"Does the like button work!" I died at that part lol lmao
Just put this on my birthday list xxx
This is actually pretty neat! It's nice to see a product that actually works every once in awhile XD
omg. she is mad
❤
I have that same brush and it's amazing
first I thought you have CUT YOUR HAIR 😱 thank I rwalized the ponytail ❤
Dawn dish soap will work better for the oil-based makeup brushes
after you wash them in the soapy water, what I would do is wash them again in clean water to make sure there isnt any soap left on the brushes, at which point you could dilute it with alcohol for sanitization :)
I want it!!! Did not know it was a UK company. Now I need to get it when I go there at the end of the month!
I need to get me one of those !
What about the soap left in there? Aren't you supposed to rinse it out of the soapy water with clean water?
You should have cleaned the first brush again to see how dirty the water would have been from a second cleaning, duh bunny.
That is amazing how well this item works. I love you're videos and I love how you do the, "does this thing really work" videos. They're one of my favorite video series you do. I hope you keep doing this for as long as you possibly can or forever you're among ok of the first youtubers I started watching and as I slowly stoped watching others I find myself not bale to stop watching yours, they're addicting, I love your personality, it reminds me of my older sister and I so much! You're amazing at what you do and as a person in general!
for anything that is creamy or greasy like concealer or lipstick should be rinsed with alcool before washing. if you were to do that before washingit with the device would be fine.
Yeah I'd rather just use my hand instead of 5 steps liked the product review though ;)
you shood yuse it for your makeup
YESSSSS!!!!!!!!
You can even just use it to dry the brushes after you per washed them
I actually just have a couple of questions for you. How do the brushes feel when you've applied your makeup after you've cleaned them with the brush cleaner? Do they feel like they apply the makeup the same when after you would hand wash them, or do you find yourself having to apply your makeup differently now?
You're 2,071,692 away from 10 million subscribers!!!
Finally something I can get in the uk
The reason you aren't supposed to have too much water in there is so the water doesn't reach the glue and loosen the bristles; because then your brush falls apart! Basically if the water is just below the bottom of the visible bristles, you Gucci :)
We did it we got 200k woohooo
what happens if there is so many likes?
She didn't put enough water and she was pushing the bristles down
OMG bunnys earrings are safety pins 😂😂😂
For cleaning liquids, I'd try to use warm water... it'll dissolve oily substances much better...
I love your hair! it actually looks clean & brushed. :')
I've only just found you xD I am super jealous with the amount of energy you have!
those eyes tho😍😍😍
are you Jewish?
OMG they charge 80 bucks for that? That's worth 20 bucks tops. What are they giving you? A bowl and a 'makeup brush spinner'.
lol fuh-rule cracked me up. 😂😂 it's pronounced fair-ul 😜 you're the best.
At the end you should fill it with alcohol and spin all your brushes thru it. That way you know all the brushes are sterilized.
I liked this because you said Does this like button really workkk haha
But then isn't the brush soapy? Like you don't rinse the soap off you just dry it off
3:28 when your trying to keep it clean on your YouTube channel
😂the like button won't work😭😭 but the dislike button did
omg! I tried to order this and it's unavailable because of  high demand
Bunny I love you! But you're a lot to handle lately!
Wow! I think I'll get one for makeup brushes and one for my craft and paint brushes! 😎
3rd, she's crazy
You could dab a little bit of soap on each brush before dipping it in the water. This way you're not waisting your soap and just switch out the water.
can someone please tell me whats up with the like button? I know that bunny isnt like thirsty but why is her video relevancy so dependent on likes? is it a new system?
her face at 4:00 omg that just made my night! lol!
I wanted to see what happened to a fan brush ToT
wow i was just watching tbe best part until they inturrepted with a beneful comercial i was like: man, seriously? 😯😏
She has the bluest eyes 👁👁
I'm a girl ps and did you get that brunch from ecotools
Yesssssssssss plz💜😻😻😻😻😻😻💩😅😅😎😎😎💤👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🐤🐣🐙🦁🐰🐹🐭🐱🐶🐻🐼🐨🐯🐸🐽🐷🐮🐮🐵🙈🙉🙊🐒🐣🐤🐦🐧🐔🐥🐺🐗🐴🦄🐜🐞🐌🐛🐝🕷🦂🐢
I think you should dye your hair peach blond
Eww wtf
When did she get blue in her hair?!?!?
I need this
Why is it important for Bunny to get likes? Just curious. Someone answer please? Lol!
Wouldn't you want to rinse them in fresh water afterwards to get the dirty soapy water off of the bristles? 😐
wow.... why do you always need to scream like that.... calm down you're still funny and cool...
For the creamier makeup I bet it has more to do with the type of soap you use and the cleanliness of the water. Cream doesn't come out as well because it doesn't dissolve well in water. You probably would need less water and more soap. You'd probably have to wet the brush then spin it in soap. You might also need to use a different soap for cream makeup? Hmmm...
Jump to the 2:30 mark if you want to avoid begging for likes-- That's where the video actually begins.
I love u so much
Ferrel is not pronounced like that 😂😂😂  it's like Will Ferrel
Lol!!! The Fish Bowl! You can just trademark your own brush cleaning system. Swamp Family Fish Bowl Cleaner. lol!!!
Bunny's hair looks green
Wonder if it gets all soap off, I think I would wash a few in water with soap then try it with water and no soap..
Use baby shampoo and a hand mixer!!! You'd be able to do 2 brushes at once!!!
0_0 I wonder how this would work for paint brushes...
please collab with Dan and Phil!!!
do more "does this thing really work"
This is the spinmop for makeup brushes 😂
if you're grossed out you could just use this device to dey the brushes
i would definitely use this for my larger, harder to clean brushes and wash tbe smaller ones the regular way. I'm so glad you dumped that filthy water out. My anxiety was starting to increase lol. Thank you for sharing this with us. Just foubd your channel and enjoyed this.
this is my first time watching you and I don't like the content.You just talk to much
Can you possibly review the "Hi Mirror"? That would be awesome!
it's neat, but wouldn't you still have soup residue on the bristles, because it wasn't rinsed.
I cried watching this video it was so funny
Can I shove my brushes in a cooking mixer ?
fuhROOL
Wish I could translate Bunny's videos to portuguese.
Idk does the like button work lets press it and find out
Too Cool...I have to have one....I always end up all wet when I use my mat.
i would like to see how clean they really get; you should try one of the brushes a second tie to see if there was any makeup left that didnt get removed the first try.
super not into this tyler oakley style "do this many likes" type of thing :/
they are actually not called phalanges they are actually phalanx. it just really bothers  me😂😂
the colour of her eyes are so damn beautiful.
LOVE the silliness at the end   You are DELIGHTFUL 💚🐊🙌🏻😂😂
When you spin that brush at 4:00.  HYSTERICAL.  You are a HOOT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💚🐊
try the "Pottery cool Studios"
Didn't the feral get dunked under water when she spun the first brush?😯
oh man I busted out laughing SO HARD at around minute 4, when you turned the machine on with the brush in it, - your face was PRICELESS-  that made my day.!!! So funny!
Wouldn't an electric drill do the same? Or even maybe a dremel tool? You may not be able to fit all the brushes in, but you could probably find an adapter to make it work...
you cold just use it for drying
@grav3yardgirl try using a bigger bowl
Omg I love her and her eyes
yes
Why was it white?
You got all your likes
I love your makeup tutorials. 💄☺️ hint hint lol.
Do they ship to the US now??? I am in Canada, and they said they don't ship here yet.  I will have to get my Californian Cousin to get it for me.  XO
could you review the Silisponge?!
I've never hear ferrule pronounced that way lol I say it fair-uhle
are you normal? or drags?
Maybe if your water was warm...might clean the cream out of your brush better
#nohate ok guys iv got a challange try to pause the videos with out hur making a weird face XD love ya xx
does anyone want to subscribe to me
weirdo
I'll just use a cup and a drill 🤗
OMG I love your dark blue eyes 😉
Hey you can use the rubbing alcohol  in there as well to sterilize  them or use a stabilized  soap
Your hair omg 😍😍
I will give it a 9.5
i love u
plz do diy clothes plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz
Please apply powder using that lol... but close your eyes and your nostrils
Am I the only one who loves my username? 🤓
YES TEST THE SPONGE
i feel like this would take so much more time to dump the water between each brush. id probably just dip them all at once in dr bronners tea tree soap solution to dissolve the buildup of product on the brush. i think if you need to dry the brush super quick when cleaning this would be better but i do agree its magic kind of makes the process seem more enjoyable to do lol
a normal liquid foundation brush would probably work
Lmao hearing her say ferrule 😂😂😂
Nothing says you can't use your nubbly mat to wash the creme makeup off and then spin it in the device to dry so you get at least the convenience of the quick dry.
omg ur eyes r beautiful👀👀👀
mL is australian measurement
We love you bunny. Ever since you started YouTube ~ biggest inspiration I know and have.
We love you bunny. Ever since you started YouTube ~ biggest inspiration I know and have.

80 dollars???!!! This is a $35-40 dollar tops! Lol
Your eyes look very pretty
I liked your vid
raindrop
I keep watching these videos because they are giving me late 90s early 00s flashbacks.
For $80 I can wash my own brushes !
I love your eyes
I ordered the silicone sponge too. Mine won't ship until between Jan. 14th and the 21st.
her hair look blue-ish/green-ish in the beginning of the video..
Does the like button really work I died😂😂
Yessss please please please try out the sponge!!!!
yes
am I the only one who yells the intro?
what the hell?!  I haven't watched her in a while, but I've been her fan for a long time.... but..  when the hell did she start begging for likes??

She starts at 2:24
HI
We learned mL in third grade
can u sub to my channel
bunny my cat is 9 weeks old
things ....things THINGS! THINGS THINGATHING
Bunny your eyes are sooooooo blue 😫😫
I use Dr bronners for my brushes. liquid for the brushes and the bar soap for my beauty blender. it cleans them so well
I really wanna get this just for how satisfying it is to see it clean brushes so quickly 😆
Do any other Swamp Family members always do the outro with her or is it just me and my weird self?😅🐊
Ml is a form of measurement which is used in Britain
I have one of these. I love it. it saves so much time.  if I'd have known you wanted one could have ordered and posted to you as based in the UK.  I was one of their first customers hahaha
Why don't you just use tap water instead?
U look way better with makeup sorry
Looked on their website for the brush cleaner and it says powder products can be washed off with soap and water but cream products you need to use their own cleaning powder. Love you Bunny!!!
SO, here's my suggestions. Do an initial wash of 10 seconds , spin, 10 seconds with the 1st soapy water on all the brushes, Then change the water and  use only clean water and do another wash and spin with clean water ( no soap ). If you want to you can also use alcohol in the basin for your cream base brushes and then after words, do a wash spin cycle with soap and water.  You can also use really inexpensive baby shampoo to do your brushes (unless you have other issues with sensitive skin)
omg thats  amazing. you can double wash them. first time with the dirty water and second time for residue. Edit: Misspelled words XD
I am new
I haven't been on YouTube in forever! When did Bunny dye her hair? It looks so good! I'm glad I'm subscribed. She is just so funny! Lol
Want it !!!
love love love these videos..please do more does this really works...these are my faves💜  love and blesses
I do love your videos but why do you always shout!!😔😔
are you carrots daughter?
I want to meet her in person just to look at her eyes is that wierd? they are just so blue like almost neon 😶
Why does she remind me of jacksepticeye
Ugh i just love when she says falanjes 😍😍😍
i like bar soap in my palm
HER
you should dunk the brushes in soap water then in another container put clean water and in tha case it will be more cleaner as you would get rid of soap residue.
eww whats wrong with your face
Omg i subscribed and I'm finally part of the swamp family !!!😱🤗😇😇
Your hair is goals!!❤️
Bunny, it would be interesting if you could do the red copper mug as like a throw back does this thing really work
Why does this girl look and act like Dee Dee from Dexter's Laboratory
her eyes😭😭😍😍
love love.love these videos!!!
I wanna see this with a fan brush
dang i needs that! any new ppl on here?
Sold!!! Even though it's $80, I am a working professional makeup artist. Hygiene is non negotiable but having to clean dozens of brushes Properly * may take up hours of your time. This product looks promising
Great video! ❤ I did see another video where they used alcohol instead of soap and water with great results as well
i like thes videos better
Bunny, you have to try the Imperial Spherificator!! It turns any food into little balls that look like orbeez/caviar!!! I'm thinking of getting it! I just want to know if it works or not. love you, bye! 😚
I am a Chinese girl, I like you very much, you so cute!
lol shes so extra😂
Her eyes are such a beautiful BLUE!!!!!!❤️
bunny girl you filled it to much cus the water is not suppose to touch the...nvm lol forgot the word
i LOVE the "DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK" videos. they're so honest and informative
I HAVE THE FIRST BRUSH SHE USED
love your hair
7:39 play video close eyes
yes please give us one your honest Bunny opinions on the silicon sponge. I have seen reviews but I feel like none of them give honest reviews like you do.
can you do a compilation of you washing your brushes?? its really satisfying!!! i love your videos!!!!!!<33 <3 <3 <3
grav3yardgirl  you should try the booby blender .. I don't know how to explain it .. so if you want to check it out .. you can search it on YouTube .. there is LOADS of videos .. oh by the way .. I LOVE YOU 💖💕💖💕💖💕
2k dislikes? wow some serious haters. I gave it a like cause I love ya bunny!
oh its a button
your stirring that soapy water like a blender
Love ur hair!!! ❤️❤️😍😲😍

Have you ever done Rocket Copters?  It might be a challenge to video in the dark, but they look so fun and are As Seen On TV!
Wait, how come she started asking for likes? Nothing wrong with it but yeah I'm confused
Test out The Right Cup. It is a cup that tricks your mind into making water taste like soda or juice.
maybe with the cream product brushes, it would be better to use mildly hot water.  Also, maybe dunking them in a separate bowl with hot soapy water before putting them in the cleaning bowl will keep the water cleaner longer. ..just an idea. Thanks for the review bunny!!!!!!!
alright so did anyone else think she said damn instead of day of
it is so satisfying watching this
Are those her real eye?! There beautiful!!
you could always use the product to dry the smaller brushes after doing the big ones, especially if it takes less time to use the silicon bump thing
Almost 8 million... im unhappy with humanity
yea it does
How did u get this item in the U.S? They won't ship it to me in Wisconsin. 😪😪😪😪
I've never laughed so hard when she started spinning the first brush😭😂😂😂
I feel like it will effect the brushes in the long run because it seems like the water gets into the pharaoh when i are spinning it in the bowl.
You have beautiful eyes !!!
no the like button dosnt work j.k.
you could probably use less soap if you don't reuse the water!!
this is so satisfying to watch
Put something bumpy like a small pot mat on the bottom of the jar before you add soap and water
i can't find any websites that has this can someone comment one?
Thanks for publishing this on my b day
i would want to do it a second time with just water like why wouldnt u rinse out the soap???
You're awesome Bunny 🐰
do one for the wisp broom!
Just curious. What's up with the asking for help with likes?
ok Mandela effect moment just happened. the first time I watch one of these I swore she said does this thing *actually* work. now it's really?! I'm so confused
ya it works 😂😂😂😂😂
Why can't they ship to my house 😭😭😭
you are hilarious Bunny! I really enjoy your videos.
how does the like button help out the video? I mean I know it helps her out because her videos are monitized. sooo
you put too much water! you are doing exactly what the show not to do😂
$67 usd ,no thanks
Your eyes😍😭
She is incredible.😂
it wasn't stained it was because u dident spin it in the water
I love your videos
If you have beauty blunders you should REALLY do a beauty blender cleaning video it's so satisfying
does anyone else actually really want to see her try to apply her makeup with the brush spinning?!?!
you can try after you washed your brushes to do the exact same thing with this stylpro brush cleaner but by putting rubbing alcohol in it (sorry for mistakes I'm french) you'll get sterilised brushes and dry them really fast at the same time
Please do hi smile!
grav3yardgirl I love your videos so much and Ive been watching you for ages so has my auntie Paige i was wondering if you could tell her I love her on your next video as I don't see her and I know she'll watch your video so please can you do it for me xx love Holly
I would imagine you're supposed to dump the water out each time. Otherwise you're just washing brushes in dirty water.
Does it ruin your brushes though and like spin/stretch it out?
OMG ur crazy,I already like u,new subscriber.
cool
yeyas bunny
yes
Eyes.Just eyes!😲😍
I still really prefer that auto cleaner that she tested before. Cleans like 10 brushes all at once and I don't even have to be present while it does it. Which is great for me because I could set it up, get dressed or whatever, then take them out after and have all my brushes cleaned and on a drying stand.  But this is pretty cool too. Not $80 cool but cool
you should do the 10000 degree  knife
I use my son's baby soap.  it works wonders. gentle but tough. I want this device sooo bad though. I'm still washing and drying by hand.
I wonder If I could rig my Dremmel to hold my brushes. That's the first thing I thought of when I saw this device. Also reminds me of those electronic nail/pedicure files. I loves how it drys the brushes. I wouldn't have to wait to use my foundation brush.
she asked for 200k likes and she got 207k likes btw ilysm❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hey Bunny, why wouldn't you just wash all your brushes, in the soapy solution, leave them wet and set them side. Then rinse each brush in clean water and spin them dry. You can change the non soapy water as it gets dirty and not waste the expensive soap.
Still at it with these videos ❤️😩😻 I'm just binge watching these kind of videos
Love you bunny 🐰 u got 200k
Who else thinks Bunny's hair is amazing?
How frequently do we have to clean up makeup brushes ?
Get some hyperactive pills gurl!!
She's kind of crazy but I love her and her channel. Not trying to be mean 😀😍
Pls pls pls do more does this thing really work because I'm 10 and it helps me to know which thing is better to get
One of the many amazing things about grav3yardgirl is you can pause the video at any point and you'll always see a funny expression on her face 😂😂
Pause at 4:00 😂😂
I'm with you Bunny,....I'd have to change the water. just seems more sanitary:)
yes. please do a "does this thing really work on the sponge" please
my brother was making fun of you bunny
Youtubers are for real so desperate for likes now days lol
no giveaways for us ?
I need this...
are you wearing safety pins in your ear?
Wow this actually works amazingly!!
Just use new water and dab the soap on each brush as you go
Bunny:Using things that they are not supposed to be used for! I died!😂😂😂
Somehow I got unsubscribed☹️ it's been months!
I bet you $10000000 bunny won't respond
ozarka water omg i moved and i miss ozarka so much
I feel like if anything you save water because your not just having running water constantly going through your brushes
What about rinsing? I bet if you put the brush in clean water they'll be soapy and still dirty.
can i plzz get 13 likes for my birthay today im finally 13!!🤗🤗
6:35 is when it really starts if anyone is wondering
If you will add some grape seed or olive oil to the mixture for the liquid foundation it'll get it clean
I love how you had 5 different reactions when the brush started spinning.  XD
I love this!  I broke my bowl the first day though 😭. I love it just for drying my brushes alone.
THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!!  i really want to get it even tho i don't use makeup but my mom does use and believe me wen i tell u this i the whole 2-3 years she has had those make up brushes she has never ever in her life cleaned her makeup brushes and to be honest she needs new ones. but she mostly doesn't clean them because she doesn't have the time to wait for the to dry and all she has places to be and she is a "tv star" from were i leave so she can't really go anywhere with ought makeup as she would leave a really bad public image with her reputation and all so i think this product would be so cool and useful for her!
If you want to wash your brushes quickly use dish soap. If they are natural bristles or you want nicer feeling brushes, add an oil while cleaning such as almond or coconut oil to the dish soap. This will remove EVERYTHING.
i love your bubbly personality and your pretty blue eyes
lol .. does the like button really work?
whats going on with youtube or her channel that she needs likes?
please please try some of those pore vacuum thingys maybe this one http://www.rosegal.com/makeup-tools/portable-beauty-skin-care-blackhead-705187.html?currency=USD&lkid=96959&gclid=Cj0KEQiAtK3DBRCBxt-Yxduq5p4BEiQAbFiaPbOEMr499apbgg45V_C6wanUErJAhZActohuG4JetEIaAgoN8P8HAQ
TRY USING ZOTE SOAP TO CLEAN YOUR BRUSHES IT  WORKS LIKE MAGIC
Can you do a review on the Harry Potter makeup brushes?
u were one of the first youtubers i sew for tue first time
I managed to buy this from the U.K. When it came out initially from a supplier who did ship to the US. It's a magical device. I do notice the same thing that with flat brushes and things packed with cream makeup it's not as effective as it is with fluffy brushes, which it very easily cleans. For super dirty brushes that have lots of cream makeup I hand wash them but use the spinner to dry them. The fact that it dries them is the best part about it!
Yeah it's a unitasker. Try the ELF brush cleaner spray.
So glad you reviewed this! I've wondered about this product!
I would use a solid cleanser after dipping it in the water and then run it and I feel like you would waste less product
A follow up for this would be great.
this one is way better than the lumi egg washer
9:44  Jack Frost.
I really like ur videos but ur voice gives me the worst headache ;(
YOUR HAIR😍😍😍😍😍
idk how much the beauty community and the DIY community overlap, but this is literally just a Dremel with special attachments...
yes do the silisponge
Do VR HEADSET DOES THIS THIS REALLY WORK
Use warm water to clean them
I think change the water between every brush is stupid and wasteful and if your brushes go in dirty anyway they'll come out clean it you reuse the water i just don't understand it
do the silisponge!!
When did bunny do the color in her hair? Where I have I been? Did you get it cut too? Bunny please tell me!!
could you clean oval brushes with this?
i cant. ive tried and tried because shes such a sweetheart. but i cant.
Bunny,yessssssssss!😍🐰
Her black strands kinda look a little blue.
Love these videos
"we don't have time in this video" *video is 18 minutes*
I love your eyes😍
when i clean my brushes  i use my facewash because its the only thing that doesn't make my face break out when using makeup and it deep cleans my face if i have makeup on so i use it on my brushes and works great and its only $3
Are those her real eyes??❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg I didn't know bunny died her hair
I live in the us
One of the YouTubers i watch said that each channel has a info thing that lets them know how many people watch a video for how long. He said that likes don't matter, that u know someone likes it because of how long they watched it. Do i gave u a dislike because they don't really prove anything
yess
Pink blush tends to stain brushes
Only bunny can make a video good even after saying "you get thing and this thing-so this thing goes in this thing"
U have to use warm water plus not the face soaps
Just curious about soap residue because I noticed there is not a rinse step. Any issues, would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for sharing ☺️
Ferrul is also for string instruments
I have the same brushes as you except mine is the flower pattern my sister had the leaf one
I don't do make up but I really want to buy this device
i totally would buy this device, but i think, for these 60 € it costs i won't buy it. Therefore it's to expensive for me.
+grav3yardgirl your eyes are gorgeous 💙💙💙
Just attach your brushes to a screwdriver 😂
Hyper
Love  love love ❤️ your product test videos. Hands down fav.!Way More than the haul ones imho. But love your vids!! Happy new year!
Can you try kids nail polish or 3D printer love u soooooo much I malled you some 300 year ago dall and a scaled green jackets 😀👌🏻
Please say I'm not the only one who saw a funny face on the brush at 11:09 ???😂😂😂
Damn girl, I'd be a happy man if we could make love.
you think I could use this for paint brushes?
jokingly saying "ocd much" lol its ok we all have some form of OCD
Does it not ship to Florida? because I've been trying to buy it and it says that there are no shipping options for the cart or destination and I don't know what that means? Pls any thoughts?
You should
Are those her real eyes?
201,000 likes. Nailed it!!!
I was the 200k like 🙋🏼
This is the worst product I have ever used! Doesn't spin the brushes at all, the solution for cleaning the brushes causes acne and the company is very disappointing to deal with
does this ship to canada?
I've been subscribed to Bunny for years and for some reason I was I subscribed...
Exactly 200K likes!!
I just went to the website && notice that for the concealer brush like the one you cleaned, they use their own brand cleanser. Probably that's why the cream didn't come off good.   Enjoyed the video! So Enthusiastic Bunny!!!
I'm totally obsessed.
I haven't been getting her videos in my subscriptions :/
we did 200k !!
At 5:54 look at her face LOL
Yes
i love your videos they help me and your so funny....i just love your videos so much
Lol you can do this yourself with an ordinary bowl without furiously spinning it.
Her eyes are soooo blue 😍
i may be wrong but i'm pretty sure i was 200,000th like.
Wonder how it would work under running water?
Yea but do you rinse the soap off? This seems like it's misses a very important step...
She's mental
Two words.... her eyes....
this is neat but I would have to rinse off the soap & dirty water off of the brush before spinning it dry.  if you don't rinse them off you're still going to have the dirty water on the brushes!
i use baby shampoo to wash mine, it makes your brushes smell good and they make your brushes softer.
Congrats bunny! Your about to hit 8 millions subs
Bunny would look really prettyn with brown eyes
I liked this video when the likes on my display said 199k hoped it helped bunny 🤗
My only concern is it's not getting rinse with clean water so it still has soap! They should give 2 bowls, 1 for soap & 1 for rinsing water. Be careful w/ alcohol it will ruin your brushes.
Why is dumping the water such a big deal? you probably use 5 times more water by just rinsing it under running water.
her eyes are sooooooooo blue
I love you
She's so loud
oh my gosh my mother and i love her channels
Me: yeah $80 Amazon uk: £100  Me: Nope thanks
U are nearly to 200 ps I love u pps can I have Starbucks
Are her eyes real?
I think if you are going to change the water each time, you could just use a drop or two of the soap instead of 1/8 of a teaspoon
you are so awesome ive been watching you for a  year or so
Stop at 0:17
just subed ur so much Like me
I am ready for the Sillisponge video! So exciting! I hope you are still considering your second channel as well. I am ready to commit to both! Would you consider putting on some make up with the stlypro brush cleaner, like some blush or something? If you do consider doing it be absolutely sure to wear your hair in a SASSY! SASSY SASSY! SO SASSY BUN! so your hair doesn't get caught up in it. I hope you & your family are having an amazing New year & continue to be so blessed! Much love to you & yours from me & mine!
Come check us out!! :D
Would it work with denser brushes
Do the new brushes
what if you took the top off the fishbowl and used a hot glue gun to add texture to the bottom on the inside of the bowl. the brushes would get cleaner.
its really sad that only 1 million out of 7 million subscribers watch the videos. same thing with every other youtuber
have you have dog man do your makeup yet if not it wood b a blast
keep up the as seen on tv we love though one the best
baby shampoo works best for the actual bristles
https://www.facebook.com/groups/230139017432152/
This was uploaded on my birthday
Do any of you guys want to support my Insta page? I'm going to start posting nail tutorials and pictures, all made by me! I invite you to go and follow it! It's nails_by_ana_2109😃💝 Thank you guys!
What if you add a little soap to the brushes so you only have to change the water out
Great video 👍
lol the ending
Have you tried the eyeliner stamp ? Maybe you could try it for your does this thing really work https://www.facebook.com/sanfilippowingit/videos/1632659273695204/
what camera do you use
Can we make her do her makeup using the twisty thing
LOVE THE BRUSHED HAIR
try Curlformers by Hairflair!!Please!!
Your hair looks so good😍😍😍
mmm YES, what if you DO apply your makeup with that spinning brush...interesting, I'd watch it lol
Bunnys eyes😻
Oh my gosh those earrings are amazing. Did she make those or did she buy them?
Okay but math though. You have almost 8 million subscribers. 300,000 likes is actually kinda low.
it looks like an air revitalizer haha
Yes!  Please test out the silisponge!
If you want to remove cream makeup, add a tiny drop of coconut/olive oil into the water! It breaks down all of the particles of makeup, including cream!
i need one
DOES THE LIKE BUTTON REALLY WORK??!!! Good one bunny
You can do it with out do it 10 tims 5 min
video starts 2:20
Is her eye colour real?!
I watched the video and then immediately ordered that brush cleaner! I always trust your videos as honest reviews. Thank you Bunny!!!!
Yes - also +grav3yqrdgirl wanted to point out in the link for this product it does have a photo showing to use this with their brand of cleaner only :(. So I am not sure if the cleaner they make would make a difference  Also imo I think that it would be better to just do the spin in the soap / water then do a second spin in clean water to rinse and then rather than spin completely dry, just maybe spin for a second or two then air dry with a brush shaping sleeve on the bristles. To dry your brushes like this every time is going to mis-shape it to flare out.
your eyes are electrifying
no shipping to Canada yet :(
i personally think your video with Dogman doing the voiceover got so many likes because that video is so popular right now. People are probably searching for that type of video specifically and then they liked it. i of course personally love all of your videos because what isn't there to love but that is why i think it got so many likes but idk, i'm probably wrong.
Youtube unsubbed me from your channel
OMG I've just realised bunny is the love child of Lisa Kudrow and Golem
your eyes look very crazy...
Also you can't use it with Realtechnique brushes :(( that's sad
You CRASY guuuurl!!😂😂😂😂 Love you so much bunny! You put a great sunshine in my heart everytime I watch your videos!! Thank you so much for being you!!❤️❤️ Love you !!
you should consider taking some pills, meditation, watching documentaries, or just something to make you more relaxed..consume consumee consume...i regret giving you a view
Great concept! I would have to rinse out the brush before drying:) it's great though! 👍🏻
So funny when you first spinned the brush out of the water and said maybe put your makeup on that way, your facial expressions were hillarious . . Love your videos Bunny x x
you are so stupid🖕🖕
I would definitely use this to dry my brushes after I wash them a different way. I wonder what an ARTIS Brush would be like using this machine? Spoon style brushes would have been fun to watch you clean. : ) Thanks Bunny!
If you want to save water and soap so you can use clean water every time I think you could just use less water and soap per brush as long as there's enough to get the bristles wet it should work!
god u talk too much
Admittedly I wasn't going to bother watching this video because this device looks awful, but omg, I'm so surprised! Those brushes look so clean! I am definitely guilty of not cleaning my brushes enough simply because of how long to wash and dry each time. Of course I'll probably have to wait another 2-3 years before it ships to Australia haha
what happened to her hair
Miller meters are are a Australian measurement I know this because I live in Australia
what's wrong with ur eyes???
girl where makeup
AWWWWW SHE SAID HER BRISH NEEDS A BATH I FIND THAT SOOOOOO CUTE!!
I love this!!!
This is so cringy.😓
this gadget is pretty cool. I find cleaning my makeup brushes boring and this looks so fun to use😀
I LOVE YOUR HAIR!!!!💙💚💙💚
I just realised that this was made by a guy who won the apprentice a few years ago. cool to see that he's doing so well
need this for my paintbrushes
why is she cringing through almost the whole vid
1) I have an etsy page too! And 2) I live in Houston too!! 🙌🏽
You remind me of the show, the washing well wenches. This is funny
You're amazing!☺️❤️
This video was satisfying to watch ! Crazy invention !
bunny u are so inspirational 💖
WOW 430 comments :-/
4:06 😂😂 I love you Bunny
I laughed like crazy when the brush spined 😂😭
I hope she's was joking when she was pronouncing ferrule.
I want want want it 😩😩
I loathe when people ask for likes. -.-
could you please try lipsense lipstick/lipgloss? Apparently it is smudge proof and stuff!! Please please try it!
I don't understand how she almost has 8 million subscribers yet can barely hit 300k likes?? like wth people why don't you like her videos especially since she puts a lot of work into them and has to edit them and stuff the least you can do is like it it litterally takes like 2 seconds if thag
I feel like I would only use this for bigger and fluffy brushes tbh and especially since I'm an mua it would be pretty convenient 😌
So weak at 3:58 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💕
HER HAIR IS MY FAVORITE. GOALS AF
You literally dipped it in the water for an entire minute lol You should probably set a timer next time. I'm worried that your brushes will get ruined.
Your hair looks so pretty today!
Me: "Using things for what they're not supposed to be used for"
Pls try tyra beauty next 🤗
I think I would use it just to dry my brushes lol
no
If you did the brushes in a tiny bit of olive oil first it would help with the cream products as well as conservation of the brush and getting them completely clean.
This... has 7million subscribers?(sorry for this english im from germanyyy LMAO)
It was my first Christmas thanksgiving and New Years without my cousin he was 23 can this get up to 50 likes please
i got goosebumps when she said "one directional" lmao
Not to be creepy but I love ur eye colors
Hi I have been watching your videos for 2 years I thinks your the greatest YouTuber EVER!!! Me and my older sis always use your videos as try not to laugh videos lol. Just keep on doing what you are!
Maybe prepare a container with enough soap and water mixed in to fill the brush cleaner multiple times, like a kool-aid pitcher or something. Then you can quickly pour, clean, dry and dump at a sink several times in a row.
I'm with you on wanting clean water for each brush.
Like #189K because there's a seven year old that thinks you are the patchouly princess
this seems like so much more work than just putting the soap in your palm and swirling the brush around lol
Can you please review the new Neutrogena light therapy acne mask
Damn! her eyes are BLUE af hell
You don't have to rinse them?
I clean them on my sink and it works 🤔
What is with the creepy facial expressions?
why do u have one earing in but the other one out
3:59 😂😂😂💀💀💀
Also, I think there are a lot of great things to this product, but it feels more like a prewash than an actual good ol' fashion washing of brushes. For one thing, even when you dry it, there is still probably soap residue left on the brush since it wasn't rinsed in clean water before drying. Another thing that freaks me out is how much it spreads out the bristles, and the force of the spinning making the bristles much looser on the brush. Unless you had a brush guard or something to put the bristles back together in its original shape, I can't see this being good for the functionality of the brush. (;_; )
Bunny, what if you use the spinner and brush to apply foundation?? I think it will be cool!! 👍🏼👍🏼
"Does the like button really work?!" Ohmygosh Bunny I love you so much. XD I don't know what's been up with Youtube lately, but the whole thing of "the more likes a video has, the more views it'll have," is actually making me so, so frustrated because most of the videos on my home page now are random videos that I'm not subscribed to, and things that I'm absolutely not interested in. I don't know if Youtube actually thought it would be a good idea for the viewers, or if this only has a monetary motivation, but either way it really sucks, and I hope that they change it back to how it was before, or at least come up with something else that isn't such a stress for everyone. But anyway, HAPPY NEW YEAR BUNNY AND LOVE YOU!!! <3 <3 <3
They don't ship to my location in Texas. Too bad I could have gotten some of my friends to order too. 😧
you are so stupid
I feel like you need two "fishbowls" one to wash and one to rinse otherwise all that soap stays in the bristles. Knowing that soap is still there would make my skin angry.
I really wish it was cheaper 😔😔
I am just going to use my drill to do this.
You could do this for cheep by using a normal bowl or a cup. Just get a cup/bowl put some water and your choice of soap. Then use your hands to spin the brush in the water. The rinse it and then dry it. It works well and is cheap because you don't need much soap.
Minute 4:00 😂 this woman is hilarious! She makes my day 😆
love you buns <3
loved watching you spin that brush in amazement.
yes please!!🐊💚
what about actually rinsing out the soap? I would think there would still be soap residue on the brush..
grav3yardgirl I love my silisponge. it's like a mini face massage and saves product
maybe warm water will help get a better cleaning
imagin that (if you cant hang by sleeping with sirens)
Her eyes are super beautiful
you scares      me
Somehow I got unsubcribed from your channnel! I was wondering why I stopped getting notifications. I missed your videos💜
You should try the Light Therapy Acne Mask from Neutrogena
can you try putting makeup on with that?
She's so animated it's intimidating
Wow bunny congrats! almost 8million I remember when had only 2million your channel grew so much!Im so happy for you keep up awesome ,funny and weird work!
I think you might be a touch ocd. lol
omg i love your vanity mirror! i saw it in the glass of the bowl lol
#aproproisawordnow
No rinsing?
I need this
2016
change de voix tu casses les oreilles!!
Can I get 18 likes for my birthday today? I'm 18 🎉
shut up!!!! you talk too much
It would be fun if she would do videos where she cleans her brushes and talks about stuff we ask her :)
Bunny you should do all the brushes in one set of water, then empty and do them all again in another fresh pot
I have severe OCD and I always think I didn't lock my main door which makes me think someone will enter my house and just MURDER MY FAMILY.. But, when I watch her for some reason .. It makes me feel comfort.. Why.. idk
Why do you need everyone to like your video?
one earing?
Do the silisponge. I was just thinking of it right before you mentioned it
I was so excited & was like Yes I Want This ! .... then she said the price... nvm
I feel like the concealer brush didn't come as clean more because it was a flat brush, not because it was liquid/cream makeup😳
Bunny! Where did you get your sweater from? :)
Hahah love your vids so I SUBSCRIBED!
200,000 likes? You have 7 million subscribers......
K
grav3yardgirl yeah your an inspiration for me I have learned so much from you in the past 3 or so years and I live you if I lived in Texas and I don't 😢😂 shout out a Danato christie
your not supposed to go past the hair or it may fall out
bunny what if u use hot water for the liquid products
its just makeup water that doesnt make it a cesspool but whatever waste water its not like its an important resource or anything
Who else does the intro with bunny? 😂🙋🏼
your hair looks awesome
That's stained
To all the people who unliked this video I just want to know why!
You could literally use an electric drill to do this. Lol
Um video starts in 2:25
You re awesooome. You say amazing -does this thing really work!!!- ahahha omg amazing 🤗🤗😬
ALMOST THERE! 182K!!
I live in the US and they shipped it to me as soon as it came out.  Been using it since last summer.
Tip for using the sillisponge don't use as much foundation as you normally would with a beauty blender that's been the downfall for most people using it
i wouldnt use that for washing my brushes... but for drying them so fast? HELL YEAH
I think that even if you change the water every time you still use way less water with this device than if you use the running water method. I want it!
The reason the brushes are dry when the come out is because when you spin the brush above the water it spins the water out and drys it
Love u
wow your hair looks great
😂😂😂 her reaction to it spinning. Love her
wonder where she got her jumper from
Omg where can I buy this?!
You used too much water
How come your eyes are SO BLUE?!??? I love them 😍
I would just use the sink with the tool
i just dont like how it flares the bristles out at the end
Hey guys, I need to tell you something. I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP. I am a developing channel that REALLY needs more subscribers. I really want to entertain people and need more subscribers to do it. PLEASE HELP ME OUT. Subscribe to my channel.
can you pls pls pls test this steam straightener from babyliss?
Hey Bunny Have you heard of this new gadget that sucks out your  blackheads. Im not sure if it works or not but it looking interesting to  me. It called the Black Head Eliminator on Amazon.
1980
can you try the vibrating foundation brush?
Does anyone else think of Pheobe Buffay whenever Bunny says philange?
I have this. The machine broke after 2 uses. Great idea but it's not the best quality
The guy who invented this was on the UK apprentice!
I watched a scary video and came here to feel safe and forget what I saw❤️love u bunny ❤️
Hey bunny, just a thought. What if you tried using a liquid dish soap wash all your brushes with the same water and soap once, (it will cut any grease or oil, it will sanitize, and be gentle on skin.) then empty and rinse the bowl then do your brushes a second time using the soap you used for this video. It would save soap, water and time! Love your videos! Thanks for being awesome!
U look crazy madam
Your eyes look like the craziest river everrrrr  ps just like yooooo
Looks like someone is really enjoying the black being back with all the hair whipping
I rlly need some of these :P
bunny pls update to 1080p !!!! :)
Collars on my falangies 😂
Ilysm 😪❤️
hahahaha LOL Your reaction at 4:00 was hilarious when you spun the brush. It was funny to see the brush expand out also. )))
If you are going to clean the brushes that used cream concealer than you'll want to use an oil based cleanser
What about rinsing the brush ?
where is your sweater from?
grav3yardgirl would this work the Storybook Cosmetic's HP wand brushes?
5:54
100k likes is possible as it's possible that you have 1mil subs
omfg your eyes 😭😭😭
I need this thing now annnnd someone to actually clean my brushes for me. :D
Great video
I really should wash my brushes...
Dear, the right alcohol to clean anything is the 70% because in 70% solution it kills bacteria and 100% will fix the bacteria there. (I don't know about 90%, maybe will be the same as 100% and fix all bad things there)   Ps: my dad Is graduated in biochemistry and told me that  :)
Bunny, love your energy.
SOLD!! I need one!
wow,  it's already sold out on StylePro's website.
yes  please  I'm your biggest fan
Thanks for this video, Bunny! I think with the water diagram, it's not an exact measurement, but rather making sure you don't get the barrel close to the water.
i love your wall! its so pretty.
Would this work for paint brushes :I?
Your eyes are so beautiful 😍
Did it piss anyone else off that she did it longer than 10 seconds every time?!
Yeah, well.. I'm still waiting for Milk Makeup to ship anywhere else than the US. Not sure if that's ever going to happen..
I love your hair
I ordered the products and it doesn't ship to my area.  Imagine that.  Wonder what I could do?
Why are you screaming at me for all the time? CAN YOU GUYS DO IT AGAIN?
put makeup remover in it for cream makeup maybe?
how did you get this?? they keep telling me that don't ship to the US!
I wonder if using Dawn dish soap would work better on the concealer and creme makeup brushes.  Sometimes I use that when I wash those by hand, when I need to cut the oil.  I'm with you on the alcohol, Bunny. :)
I love how excited she was playing with the brush in the air 😂 and the spinner thing 😂❣️
I was watching an old "does this thing really work??!!" and it was the steam off, I searched it, and there is another product called steam ON, it looks like a pretty different process, and looks like it works really well! Of course I don't know anything about it and one request won't do anything but just wanted to let you know!
I love your hair. Did you get blue in it or is the black starting to fade? Either way i really like it
cool
This made me laugh so hard 😂😂😂😂
I would rinse the brushes before dunking them in there and again before drying them but it looks like it works
Sadly the shipping to switzerland costs more than the device itself 😭😭😭
Someone please tell me how to clean a beauty blender, because I'm trying so many different things and it's sort of spoiling the blender
She reminds me so much of Phoebe from Friends 😂💕
do a review for the scribble pen!!!!
So I tell my hubby I want one and he says he'll just attach my brushes to his drill! Lmao pls no! This product looks awesome 👍🏼
grav3yardgirl yes you should do a does this thing really work for sillispounge
Ferrule rhymes with Darrell
That looks so weird and cool
your eyes are so pretty
Is that your real eye colour c
Does this work on flat brushes, like a flat shader brush?
Specifical is my new favorite word😂😂
i feel like first I would run them through soapy water, spin dry, then dilute alcohol into some water, spin it in that solution ,spin dry again, for my peace of mind. maybe pre-cleansing cream-packed brushes? IDK. wondering if this is worth it
can you wash oval brushes with it xxx
I haven't thought of using alcohol as a last step. I might have to try that every couple of washes. How come  this thing doesn't have people rinse off the soap from their brushes in clean water? Either way... I want one!  :)
This is made by the person who won the Apprentice about 5 yrs ago
Bunnys eyes are so gorgeous!!
Perhaps you could wash your brushes in the normal way that you would, but just spin them dry using the machine instead of letting them air dry if you want fast turnover of brushes? -shrugs- :)
Your mind is very wasteful 😂
Scary
The bowl needs to be bigger, it needs to do more that one brush at a time and there should be a rinse cycle.  Can't stand the thought of soap residue in my eyes.
this product is really cool, but not $63 USD cool. I'd rather just wash them myself than pay that much but that's just me. wish it was cheaper :(  thanks for the review though!!! <3 you!
What does she mean when she said the likes helped the video out ??
your skin is so clear!!
i went to buy it but i really dont have £50 to spend😂 imma stick to my hands😂
did she dye her hair black again?
Oh,  God...  I hate when you ask so desperately for likes...
와....효과 쩐다...
will u dye your haie blue 😆😆😆
OMG the starting never gets old LMFAO
Bunny makes me feel cozy and comfy some how.
I am a makeup artist and I have been using the Stylepro over 6 months and it is a lifesaver for me. When cleaning cream/liquid makeup off my brushes, I dunk them first in clean water and while holding the brush downwards, I massage a tiny bit of baby shampoo into the bristles before putting into the bowl and they come out 99.9% of the time spotless 😊
This thing looks so cool 😍
why
the reason there is still makeup residue on the concealer brush is because Murad's cleanser is not meant to be used on brushes, it does not break down makeup. Since you are sensitive Bunny, using Philosophy's Purity would be a better option as it will actually break down the left over makeup.
Mai usor fa nebuno , ai turbat ? 😂
my power just went out
ohhh I need one of these in my life!! I hate cleaning all my brushes but as a makeup artist its even more of a must so I may have to get this one! thank you for trying it for us!!
Hi Bunny, I hope you had a terrific xmas and an ace New Year!
She reminds me of Jessii Vee
That awkward moment when you almost reach your like goal but you don't 😢
my mom would love that to clean her blush brushes
omg your eyes are so pretty! I cant belive how blue they are :o
I think it's less wasteful this way because you don't leave the water run while cleaning, you only use the small amount for each brush, so imagine you only have like 10 brushes its definetly less wastefull, but not the soap obvi ^^
You should try to wash them afterwards to see if the soap was still there. Cause you know, soap on face
I love you but your videos are TOOOOO long
This video kept being recommended to me an the only reason I eventually clicked on this video was because the chick in the thumb nail looked like a hyper-realistic anitmated drawing ..... turns out she is not and is infact a real person with crazy blue eyes. Subscribing because of her high energy. Thanks youtube algorithm!
but then again think how much water you can save! if you're like me i keep my tap running because I'm the same as Bunny, like i can't clean then in dirty water so to keep it clean as possible i keep the tap running, but with this i wouldn't mind emptying it out for each brush because its less water then how i would do it normally! thanks for this video Bunny! helped a lot =)
3/4 tsp soap might be easier to measure out in the US. Half a ml less won't kill anyone.
It destorys the burshes :(
I love your blue eyes
She talks so creepy
Love it.
When did bunny start asking for likes like this 😂 like in the intro I mean the swamp fam loves you there's no reason to be like those other youtubers who do that 😂 idk I love her but I dislike it when they go like "can we hit this many likes!!!" But maybe that's just me
And on my comment I just put it continues so please just hit it so you can read the rest
Your awesome please never stop making vids you inspire me in life I've been wathing you for about 4 years and I love your channel never stop making vids your the best and I hope you had a merry Christmas and a happy new year thank you I can not find out how to send you swamp family mail plus I loved this vid it was so funny and cool and I wanted to ask or suggest a thing with is can you check out and this would be on a does this thing really work the um oh ya!

I love you so much and thank you for the amazing video
When I watch your videos it makes my day so much better!
learn how to pronounce ferrule
Try warmer water with brushes that you apply cream makeup with.
I love how suprised you were after the brush started spinning.
Who's watching in 2017 ?
No a fence  but your kinda creepy
She would be so good as a voice actor in a Pixar movie or something
love ya ur sooo me bunny
She has pretty eyes!
You get a dislike for wasting a minute of my life asking for likes
I'm so subscribeing to this channel
How in the hell does this video have so many likes. I'm trying to watch but she's so loud- sounds like she's shouting and she's so ridiculously over the top.
Grav3yardgirl yassssss👌🏻
3:50 when you just stopped and looked at it. Lmao!! You're too funny 💕💕
Put water in a bowl then put electric in the water or get Diet Coke and mints
Hiiii everyone !!
Tried buying it and it said they couldn't deliver to the area where I live I'm just so upset
what? no rinse cycle?!
you're pronouncing the "ferrule" all weird T.T
Does anybody else miss her paranormal videos????
just use a full tsp lol don't be anal.
Who else thinks Bunny should start showing us what she buys for groceries, and what she eats/drinks from day to day ? !
Her eyes are sooo pretty!!
Can I get subscribers? Thank you 😂
You're video's are long af ... hehehe .. but i love you alot .. :*
Whenever I clean my brushes I use a garnier liquid thing and it's super easy and somewhat satisfying!!
just buy the huge bottles of baby shampoo to use in this and to clean your brushes in general
Why wouldn't you just wash all or at least a few brushes in the same water then change the water and give those brushes a second "rinse" to get out any left over product? Seems to make a lot more sense than changing the water after every brush.
can someone please tell me why she is now asking for likes? I feel like I'm missing something
Please do
The like button really works!!
who's watching on 2017?😂
your so funny i subscribed and liked the video!
i dunno why, but when i watch your videos they make me feel safer and happier- thank you for being a positive person no matter what, Bunny, i love you so much.
What rinses the soap from the brushes?
was watching and you asked us for likes and I realized I was unsubscribed. Idk what is up with youtube but ive been watching for a while (I love you btw) but I know I was subscribed before. Just saying
I would probably clean a few brushes in the same water and then do it again in cleaner water to make it less wasteful. I'm not as worried about sanitizing my brushes though. I just want them clean
she's like a white walker O:
Just when you were about to spin it an ad came on...fml lol luv you!!
lol, its a Dremal tool.
yes sponge
I was literally looking for what this product was called because my mom got me all new makeup brushes. You have just saved my life. I thank you.
i had the same feeling about the thought of using the same water.
Her black hair is just clip ins right?
Can't you just use a drill?
How do you think you would be able to use this with a double ended brush like the ones that come in the naked palettes?
I just realized something you would make an awesome understudy for Dory from Finding Nemo and the sequel Finding Dory your voice is somewhat of a younger version of her and I know it's Ellen DeGeneres but character-wise it seems to match
Oh she grew knew her when I was 8 years old ohh you grew so fast love you bunny
ya
I totally understand sterilizing brushes with (I think you said) rubbing alcohol. maybe instead of dipping your brushes in it, buy a spray bottle from the dollar store and lightly spray it on?  You could do multiple at a time and use less product.
i love your hair
So. . . this thing probably wouldn't work for paint brushes? :( That gives me a sad, because I paint lots more than I do makeup.
i just lost it when she first spun the bush. omg.
Would this work for paintbrushes?.... • - •
i'd use that to dry my brushes
Anyone else think Katy whispers compared to bunny? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dear grav3yardgirl,         I know people think that they don't look pretty without makeup but u are pretty even without makeup and with pimples....
She's being too picky
omg i need this! i just filmed a video using those same brushes lol
Just got your pallet in the mail. It's amazing
Is it weird that I clean my brushes with shampoo?
Did you dye your hair with blue highlights?? Cuz it looks good!
I miss the sassy dance
*Attaches brushes to power drill somehow *
Why is she asking for likes? Are times getting tough?
YouTube keeps I subbing me from you :| can't I enjoy a vacay, YouTube???
happy new year
Just tried buying this but it said shipping not available in my destination 😭 from California.
For your cream makeup brushes, you could clean them using your sigma mat that you said you had and then dry them using the stylpro? I don't know, it's just a suggestion.
I ❤️ you bunny like if you agree
It's my moms dogs brother's uncles birthday today can I get 20 likes? XD
Are those her actual eyes because they are just gorgeous
Why doesn't she think she will get 100,000 likes she has over 7 million subscribers
bunny your hair is turning into a blueish greenish colour.
I litterly created 10 accounts to like your videos😂😂
I'm with you girl, I need to over clean my beauty tools too
I don't think it got all the soap out
Ohh, Bunny,the word 'apropos' doesn't NOT mean 'appropriate' and shouldn't be used as its substitute. It means more like 'by the way' or 'along those lines...'. As in, 'Apropos of makeup washing tools, have you ever tried Brand x brush soap?' The emphasis on the last syllable, 'proh', and the last 's' is silent.
can you please wear make up
I clean my brushes with the blood of those who don't like this comment
The black is already fading
does anyone know if this will eventually damage brushes? it seems like it would because it's making the bristles move in a way that they weren't meant to
Starts at 2:18
I feel like what you can also do is pour some soap on a separate tray, and just dip the brush first and THEN spin it in the water, it'll help save soap. Thats what i would do if i had it
you make my day every time I watch one of your videos a smile just a little bit more
c; just came here to leave a like.
Bunny I don't think you realize that you only have one earing
Her reaction is priceless LMAO 4:00 😂❤️
yesssssssssssssssssssss
Can this work for art brushes, too?
you're so close to 8 million subscribers
whenever i need something to make me feel happy, I always come to watch Bunny's videos! she makes me feel like i can do anything and makes me feel safe!
A more cost effective alternative: A cordless Dremel. They are variable speed. Then you can do your nails, clean your brushes, saw, sand, screw, cut, scrap, carve, grind and drill things. Multi-tool. They come in pink, if you are so inclined.  The "silicone" sleeves can be easily recreated with a bit of heat shrink tubing.
does she have like a problem or is she just like that
THE THUMBNAIL SCARED ME ANYONE ELSE ?
i would clean a few brushes @ a time, then change the water & wash them again
Yes
Or, you can stick your brushes in a electric drill and let it spin over our own bowl of soap....
Honestly, I'd buy this just to dry my brushes. Normally it takes forever
I got that for christmas and it works so well and its class
I wish it was not 50 bucks. I want it though.
you have beautiful eyes
Jesus I just finished watching an ASMR and then tapped on this and the intro scared me SM
how about using the dirty water to wash all of them then using plain water as the "final spin" then do the last drying cycle at the end.
I would definitely say you must repeat the whole cleaning process in clean water with no soap to rinse the brushes.
Me: "wow I might actually get it " bunny: "it's just under $80 "  Me: "never mind"
she must go through a lot of soap. you don't need to buy super expensive soap to clean brushes just use dawn dish soap if ur gonna change the water after every brush. I'll still stick with hand washing since I don't use a lot of brushes and use the same ones more than once.
What I use as brush cleaner and face wash is actually baby soap it's cheep and works!!
i feel like theres an extra step thats missing. dont you have to rinse it after putting it in soap water so you wont have soap residue ????
"Using things for what they're not supposed to be used for" should be a video idea. Lmao
I really really really need this for my pro kit and they don't ship to Australia 😒😒😒😒😒😒
why does this look like  something aliens would use for
I love it but it's pretty expensive. WOW! 63$ USD which means almost 80$ CAD + shipping...Yikes!
There is one brush that I don't think would work, at the dollar store here you can buy really nice brushes... but opposite the bristles there is a really hard to use beauty blender. Idk why 😂
(^•^)
Love your channel!
I love you bunny at night I always watch scary videos then come to your and I feel happy
How can someone purchase this? I clicked on the link grav3yardgirl provided but it doesn't ship to me, which is in Texas?  I hate washing my brushes, but this looks neat and I would really like to use it!
You should try warm water
Rinse the brushes quickly with water before doing this to have less dirt water. Also  use the water several times, then get new water and then rewash all the already clean brushes to be extra clean. I think doing it like this will give the best results while waisting the least water and soap.
did u dye ur hair or are they fake
Just don't use so much water and use Johnsons baby shampoo instead.
maybe mix up a batch of water/soap solution prior and just use and dispose as you go instead of using so much for each brush
Love you so much bunny
You can always wash them normally and use it only for drying
I use that same face cleaner and that's an expensive soap to be using to clean brushes!
This product is so amazing! I need this in my life 😆
I've been looking for some good makeup cleaners also, does anyone know where this shirt is from ?? i love it !!
Can you do a DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK for the milk cosmetics holographic highlighters???
i hope u nevER CHAngE ur inTRo
You are so funny ,awesome love the the does this thing really work vids as well as the makeup vids.
Hi I'm a makeup artist from Dublin Ireland! And I use this...and I honestly think if you get the cleanser from stylpro it takes every single peice of dirt rom powder and liquid products from the brush!! Also you can do all your bushes in the liquid at once,that's what it was made for,convicte brush cleaning for makeup artists on the go! Not going back and forth emptying water!! I promise you it works!! 😊 Btw I absolutly loveee your Chanel!!
I have that first brush she reviewed and it was 5 bucks at Ross and it SLAYED MY LIFE
Using coconut oil is good on makeup brushes
Love your hair
I would love to see how you normally clean your brushes!
YOURE HAIR I LOVE ITTTT
i love her eyes omg
Lol look at the makeup brush at 4:10
The best soap to use on brushes with natural brush hair is Mane 'n Tail Shampoo. It also works ok on synthetic fiber brushes.
Can I have ur autograph plz ur so funny
The noise u make 4:10 is so funny..can I have ur autograph
I think the thing would be good to dry but not wasj
"Honestly, it smells clean" -Bunny    2017
So glad bunny finally did another does this thing really work video. I was missing them so much.  I wonder if you put the sigma mat thing in the bottom of the bowl before cleansing the cream makeup brushes, if it would stay put and help clean the brush? If it's silicone, it may just stick to the bowl if you don't put a lot of water in it.  Also, maybe you don't have to put as much soap in each wash if you're emptying it out every time? You might even be able to use 1/2 the water too. Also, I use purity face wash by philosophy to clean brushes and wash my face, it takes liquid makeup off like it was nothing. And for $55 for 32 oz. it's not too expensive when you only use a quarter size amount for your face. I got 2- 32oz bottles. I'm not even 1/3-1/2 way done with the first bottle and I've been working on it since September or August.
Looks pretty good. Seems like it works well.
I wonder if you can just put your makeup brush in a drill, using the brush as the drill bit..?
Totally buying this❤
we DESTROYED your like goal! done and dead! look at that!
Love the new shorter do with the cool colors in it.  I swear, any video you post, I will watch it & I'm sure I'm not alone.
Hygienic anti bacterial brush cleaner is better to use then alcohol alcohol will loosen the glue and ruin your brush.
you scare me...
Your Eyes Are So Beautiful!❤️💙❤️💙
Which murad soap is that?
if I were you I would do a soap spun and a rinse spin afterward
i was gonna say this in the boyfriend does my voice over video but her eyes are so pretty and so blue like its amazing especially when she has eyeshadow on and because she uses darker colors her eyes pop
Yes
I love ur hair 👱🏻‍♀️
I think I would just use that for drying
I love you bunny! You entertain me even though I should be productive and do homework lol

What about attaching your brush to a drill then put it in water :)
Yes please do a video on the silisponge
always have to turn the volume down watching her
Loved the review i ordered these and can nit wait to get it,And it seems to work very well.xoxolynette3232
do it and thx ill always be swamp family :)
You're one of the very first YouTuber's I started watching consistently and you've never failed to make me smile, Bunny! Your channel will always be one of my favorites and I will always be looking forward to more from you! (: (:
you could just wash them once and then again with new water if they need more cleaning anyway.
I LOVE YOUR HAIR BUNNY! I ALSO LIVE IN TEXAS
THIS WAS POSTED ON MY BIRTHDAY!!❤❤❤❤Love You bunny you are the best youtuber ever!!!!!❤❤❤💚💚💚
Please do more fan mail videos
This product really seems so pointless. Just wash them?
I do this technique but with a hand drill. I just tighten the drill head onto the brush handle. I can clean about 40 brushes in 10 minutes.
yay. people have never done this with flat brushes. i wanted to know if it worked. thanks. haha
You could always do a washing with alcohol in the bowl to thoroughly sanitize your brushes
you should do poppit it is at Walmart the beginner set is 15 that is what I got it comes with everything I got the cupcake on I am 10 year old
This "type" of system has been out for YEARS for cleaning paint brushes and paint rollers but instead of using this little machine you have a special clip that attaches to a electric drill ...  all I can say is it works immensely well for the paint brushes and rollers so id go for this little machine and at the end of the day even if you just used it to DRY your brushes after you've washed them its worth it as you wouldn't have to wait hours for them to dry
can u do a house tour
You dont have to rinse the soap off before you dry it???
I like her videos but she talks too much
cool video
yes
I don't know if you've done it but plz can you do that straightening brush thing plz plz plz 🙏🙏🙏
I would put my spoon in there to stir my tea 😂 ☕️
I Love the color of your eyes!
You can dance, cook, what ever your heart desires, we will watch whatever you film.😀 Good people deserve good things.😘
Not Mean said, but you have improved a lot her on yt and now I actually enjoy seeing your vids since your hair looks nice..
you are the best youtuber 💗
Did any1 else hear this and think she was reviewing a sec toy coz it definitely sounded like that to me 😂😂
How much is the cleaner fish bowl thing ? 😂
why does she force herself to act like this i want to set myself on fire
YESSS !!! I WANTED THIS SO BAD ! Also use alcohol to sterilize because i am very acne prone but use a little spray bottle i use my old mario budescu rose water bottle and its the perfect spray bottle and just spray your brush before use !! :)
yes I would
I just realised something without makeup she's cute but with makeup she's sassy lol
Your eyes😍😍😍
Take a screen shot every time she says thing
What happened to curling your hair with random things?! I loved that series. Like if u want her to do more of those bods
Hi random person going through the comments!!!! Give this a like if this is you!!
i know your from pearland becuse  you go to my aunt church
You use air quotes way too much but still love you
I don't know if this is a good idea or not for a new YouTube series for Bunny, but what about "WILL IT BLEND?" Testing products that could possibly blend makeup. I bet this idea has already been presented, I was with my friend for New Year's Eve and she was blending her makeup when her father yelled that we were leaving in five minutes and she started beating her face with the beauty blender. 😂😂😂
Her eyes be poppinnn 💥👀
I dont even wear makeup I have completely clear skin and want it to stay that way
Hmm I can't be the only one thinking the brush cleaner looks like something else
i would do that with my mini drill machine😂😂😂
I love your shirt Bunny🙃❤️
When Bunny asks for likes.... not my fave
I'm not shore im mean I like what she's saying but the shouting is a bit too much
Subscribed.
Your hair is like green bunny
The like button does work👍🏻
Yes! DTTRW the Silisponge!! Please!
You had one earring
I clicked like just because you asked.  So entertaining, I love your energy xxx
Yes do xx
I like her videos but I'm finding myself skipping lots of it because I actually just want her to stay on topic ):
why is she sooo overacting...
Are those youre real eyes???or contacs
I would just wash my brushes normally and use that thing to dry them😄🙈
Cool
what are your eyes? they look like freakin ocean or something
@grav3yardgirl  sorry a bit off topic but would you do a flipping fantastic review!? It's suppose to help with cooking pancakes,eggs etc. Happy New Year!!!
omg yesssssss plz
please stop begging for likes
I don't like your hair black and blonde :( looks so bad
You should do the lilumia
I think using this with just plain water after using your hands and massaging it with soap and water with your bare hands
Who else is watching this in 2017
Girl your humor just brightened up my day
How do over 1000 people miss the like button
Are her eyes real? I've watched her for 3 years and I've never known haha
i went to check out their website and their tutorial video on their website suggested their cleaning solution for long stay make up perhaps trying their cleaning solution for cream make ups might work better but great video :D
I'd use this solely for drying if anything
i havent seen your video's in ages! youtube at it again.. happy to see you still make video's :)
omg I love you
my daughter said, "wait! she didn't sippy sippy!!" our entire family are fans. :)
i would totally use it with one of the silicone matts instead. it would definetly be good for the clean make up issue and then you wouldnt jave to change the watter cause your in the sink
Bunny you're so cute and I love your videos so much ❤️❤️❤️ As a New Year's Resolution I'm going to be building my YouTube channel and I'd really appreciate it if anyone would simply check it out! Thanks! ❤️
she starts spinning at 7:35
I actually really like the blue-ish grey-ish color the black faded to
Bruh, I had my headphones in with the volume all the way up and I have a hangover r.i.p
woah your hair is kinda blue now
It's a shame her channel is dying now
her blue eyes really stand out in the video
I love you Bunny! but i feel like you always ask for subscribers and likes, i feel like its all about that now :(
Yay!!!! Missed this series sooooo much
DO THE SILISPONGE PLEASE
Okay I think bunnys hair is just absolutely beautiful in this vid!😍
Oh my god we're almost at 8 million swamp members 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
Can someone please tell me how the brush goes flat when you spin it or is that just the effect just the force of it spinning or am I just being stupid???
i want this
I want this! So cool!
you should do sili sponge really soon
I really love bunny's blue eyes 😍😍😍😍😍😝😝😝
You're hair look sooo dope
Your eyes are the prettiest eyes I have ever seen! Love you bunny!
*watches these even though im a 22 year old adult male who will never use this* I love you, Bunny.
dude. bunny. i like you but your energy is crazy.
I think you still waste less water with this device replacing it after every brush than by cleaning them in the sink under running water.
I tried to order this item but it says it has no shipping method for them to ship it to me here in Nevada
This is my first video of 2017!!!!😂💖
how much does it cost
this would be cool for an artist too
This girl looks like she's super nice on the outside, but at soon as she doesn't like you anymore she turns psycho and kills your hamster or sth
Lmao Only Bunny can make a makeup brush cleaning video this hilarious and fun. Happy New Year, Bunny!!! 🍾 💋 ❤️
Yes!! Please try out the Sili Sponge!! I'm seriously considering getting one because I can't use the beauty blender due to nerve damage from Multiple Sclerosis and if you can try it out that would be so amazing!! You helped make my 2016 so much better Bunny!! Keep up the amazing work and I look forward to seeing more from you!! 😘
I will say, this can also be used for normal paint brushes as long as the bristles are not flat.
Wow, I can only stand about 20 seconds of this
it sucks that you couldn't use double sided brushes in this
Is it weird that you do not rinse the cleaner out?  Is that normal?
For me I would end up using less water and soap because I let the water run and have to use at least two pumps of baby soap per brush (usually). Thank you so much for reviewing this!!
Bunny I saw your next video on snapchat but when is it coming up?🐊🐊
would love to see a video of which " does this thing really work" products you still use!xo
why do they beg for likes o-o?
#the plane dose even have a filangie
That moment when you're an American and actually knew that 4ml was less than a teaspoon because pharmacy af.✌
It's getting longer and linger until you start testing your products
Have you tried using baby shampoo to clean your brushes? It works really well!!!
Did Bunny cut her hair? Sorry I had to get a new phone and it took 2 weeks
hello everybody it's my 16th birthday and it would be the best birthday present  if i could have 16 likes and if i get 16 subscribers i will start a channel have a happy new year everyone ! 😃
Omg Ilove your hair Bunny!!! ❤❤❤
My question would be, if after you cleaned that white brush, if you were to put it under running water would it still be soapy and not run clear? The problem I have with it is it's only in soapy 💦 water. 🤔
I use Dawn dish soap and olive oil to wash my brushes. It helps getting oil based products off and conditions.
Omg you died your hair
How about the Artis brushes? I don't think it would work on them
That looks so cool
$80?! No thanks! 😝
i love your hair in this video!  (and all of them, especially the sassy bun of course) this is pretty neat haha
Ew what are filanges
🎁 Happy new year Bunny😘 try using just a tiny amount  of water....  and centrifugal force is a mighty thing 💥
Hahahah I love you so much you are a funny hahhaha
Just Get A Fish Bowl And A Drill!
bunny is really addicting . omg
Is bunny an Aquarius
Just wash your brush w your hands.. It would take 20x less time.. Jesus Christ
You should try rocket copters
It's great for big brushes but woeful for smaller One's especially flat brushes. My fluffy blender went all out of shape. The big brushes wash fantastically well
I need this I normally soak all of my brushes for a day it does work but not as good.
I'm back swamp family!
Why does she want us to like her vid ?
Bunny you are the best: I bought the tarte palette based on the instagram tarte comments. Fell in love with that and started following you on Youtube.  Found out my sister has been a fan of yours for awhile and now we trade swamp girl stories. You brighten a day - keep it coming. We are probably on the older end of your fan base but hey, there is no age limit to make-up fun and humor, right?!
Hasn't she posted this video before.....? I seriously remember her already reviewing the exact same product.
you are bizarre 😁
Omg I am new here, and this girl is CRAZY! I'm definitely gonna subscribe :P
Do a happy new year givy
Silisponge!!! Do it! Everyone has a different opinion about it...I want to know yours.
you are wierd
Do the silisponge!!!!
You could just have a separate cup of clean water to use in between the soap and the drying, all things considered the little fishbowl is just to stop water flying everywhere, but if you used a little bit of water in a glass or a cup it probably wouldn't splash too much and it'd rinse your brushes nicely! :3 Cool product though!
it's 2017!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
get a dremmel and a bowl 😂😂😂
Can someone tell me why she needs so many likes? I'm genuinely curious as to why she asking for likes.
i love u grav3yardgirl
Review wet2straight? 💕
Hey Bunny, fun fact if you want to sanitize your brushes with alcohol, use 70% alcohol cuz 90% dries to fast to actually sanitize the makeup brush. Learned that from a famous makeup artist I follow :)
Can someone just make a Instagram account and just make videos about cleaning with this? It's so satisfying
You are Amazing <3 <3 ...many kisses from Greece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Funky noises" -I hear ya girl. 😉
Yooooo I need this machine!! I bet it would work for emergencies too
Yes
THE like button does work  Mine too?
Where is the 'rinse' phase?
I love u Bunny!! I've been offline for a couple of months so I haven't seen ur videos and I missed them u make me feel happy and safe❤️️❤️️
I would just use a rinsing bowl with clean water next to it, wash the brush in the device, rinse it in the rinsing bowl, and dry it with the device. There would be probably no need to change the soapy water each time but I'm not sure n_n and the brushes should come out cleaner
Can they make a version of this for spoon brushes
Missing the old bunny rn
apply ur makeup using that product 😂😂
I love you i have been subscribed to u for years now, love u so much xxx
OMG the new algorithm destroyed all the youtubers.gimme like gimme like !! I s2g 🙄🙄
You should try out the Vamp Stamp
When u screamed OOUUHHHH I died XD
DIS IS AMAZING
Yes you should do the silisponge
I think that there shop be a rinse so there isn't soapy residue on the brush
who else sang "a brave new world" in jared leto's voice in this is war 😂😂😂😂
I feel like these brushes are drying soapy...wouldn't you want to rinse it?
GOD I NEED IT IN MY LIFE
I liked! haha
Your eyes are mesmerising! <3
Bunny since you may double wash and will help with cream makeup use Dawn first. Then clean with your cleaner. I don't think you would have to change between. Also for your germs you could use a third go with a 50/50 alcohol water mix that way your clean all the way down. Let me know.
70% alcohol should be used for disinfecting (you can't sterilize makeup). Anything less isn't high enough in alcohol and anything more evaporates too quickly to properly disinfect.
Iv only seen 5 or 4 of your vids and you still scare me 😳
Omg she looks so scary cant watch this at night :S
it's zo expensive!! it's 72,- euro incl. shipping to the netherlands!
A Happy New Year to all you homies out there!!!   And I will agree that this thing really works...
Why am I even watching this? I never put make up on.
I don't like when people testing things without reading the instructions and get upset if it doesn't work. So yaas queen, finally someone who tries the products the way they're supposed to work. THANKS! ♡
I like her earrings.
The only problem I see about using this is the soap is still on the brush(s) there is no way to rinse the soap. It makes sense to me to clean all the brushes first. Pour out the dirty water and add plain water to remove the soap still on the brushes. Otherwise for me would not make the brush(s) clean and end up breaking out my face.
I absolutely love your hairrrrrrr 😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍🤗
i like her channel ,but as for me she has the most disturbing face i ve ever seen.Looking at her makes me somehow angry XD
This is cool if you use a lot of make up brushes. I only use one for my eyebrows. I clean my brush with my face only soap swirl it around in the palm of my hand rinse under warm water. And swirl it on a paper towel to dry it out quicker.
Is her eyes naturally that color? I'm new around here. 👏🏼👀😍

Haven't watch the video but I will. Just wanted to tell you that I am watching one of the series that you recommended The OA and as of right now is very intriguing. Thanks for it :D OH and Happy New Year's, Sorry that I am very behind on your videos is just that I have times that I watch You Tuhe or Series but not both and now with this serie there will be no You Tube and then the next one I will be watching is Black Mirror.  So Goodbye You Tube welcome back Netflix. Also I need it to go away from all the drama of You Tube... I miss the old YouTube :(
She's almost like Liza Koshy but louder lol 😂
You scare me so much (I'm new to this channel)
hello I'm from 2017 xD
I would use one batch of soapy water to do all the brushes and then repeat with a clean batch! x
yes
Who's watching in 2017? :)
Bunny how do you normally clean your brushes? i use loooooads of water when I do mine and loads of MAC cleaner :/
Chomping at the bit.   Lots of city people probably don't know what that truly means, and/or what it looks like.
I think if you used warm water - especially on liquid foundations and products - then it would be better at separating the oils in the products and you would get better results! Have this product and love it! Highly recommended 😊
WOW UR EYES R SOOO BLUE!
Does anybody know where her sweater is from?
happy new year graveyard girl I love your visitors can you give us trip of your home sometime

so its dry but my question is how much soap is still in the brush after dry spinning. leftover soap chemicals absorbing into my skin freak me out. lol. bunny you and me both have hella anxiety
YGG u almost have 8M subs!!🎉🔥✌🏻
Can I have 12 likes for my birthday??
How does she let her brushes get so dirty?
Yes do it😃
Bunny I love you but I didn't even watch the major content in this video but you're asking for likes already
Can I get likes for no reason
we get it you have blue eyes
I originally saw it from Goss!
Bunny did u colour ur.. Hair black..???
I thought your eyes were edited on the thumbnail they are beautiful
grav3yardgirl Hi Bunny :D I was wondering if you could check out the luminess airbrush system :) Also I definitely think you should try the sillisponge:D I love you Bunny and the swamp fam ❤ always sending love and blessings
wonder how the artiste brushes would do with this... love you Bunny!!!
I just realized that Bunny wasn't in any YouTube Rewind (idk I don't remember) BUNNY IS BAE plz like this so Bunny can see?
It's like a washing machine.. for your brushes
I show my little sister the thumbnail and she got scared and cried. 😂😂 scary.
Damn gurl you are so energetic. I LOVE IT!
sometimes she sounds like dory o.o....
can I have bar your silicone doll I'm just a kid can I please have it as I've been wishing for it it's Christmas
can can I have URL what's it called again EXO
Thumps up for Ozarka bottled water
I'd try warm or hot water and soap for cream brushes. No matter what there's some oil content to it so warm or hot might do better
Her eyes 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Happy New Year Bunny! Thanks for all the great videos!
I bought one from I Love Makeup that shipped to the US earlier this year. It came with a bottle of brush cleaner and I found it worked much better than soap and water method.
You remind me of the babysitter in the incredibles
This is the first video I will watch in 2017!!!!!
Yes! please do the silisponge! I've seen many videos of it but yours always feel...I dunno... honest?
HAPPY NEWYEARS I guess it's time to live harambe behind
I dont use makeup brushes, but I youtubed painting spaceship models and this popped up... I was extremely entertained
Happy New Year!! I hope you had a happy new year :) and I hope you have an awesome 2017 (cuz 2016 was TERRIBLE)  💚💚😁💚💚
what a train wreck.
of course I hit the like button love your videos 😃😄 always makes me feel better if I've had a crappie day. Ohhh happy new year 🎉🎊🎈🎊🎉
I wonder if this would work with my dremel....  hmmmm....!
Honestly Her eyes are so beautiful 😍😍😭
I LAUGHED SO HARD😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 4:00-4:15
bunny is gonna hit 8 million I can feel it😍😍❤
Omg I want one right now
love to see the. sillisponge! ps Bunny ur awesome!
am i the only one who says "does this thing really work" out loud??? xD
So a screwdriver and a fishbowl? 🐊😂 okay
What happened to your hair?  Why is it green?
First Video IV Watched in 2017!!!!
Maybe on the cream brushes, using one of those like scrub pads. You know what I mean? Spin it against those bumpy brush-cleaner surfaces should do it!
They don't give you a specific line for water because brushes are different lengths. Different water levels are needed for different brush lengths.
Do silly sponge and also love the eyes
yess i love watching your videos and there so helpful for when i want to buy things and i just enjoy your wonderful personality
Ok so I keep feeling like the brushes can't be clean because the soap never gets rinsed off! I would want to dunk it and spin it in clean, non soapy water too before drying it.  I totally want one now!!!!
what are likes for
you did better then shaanxo.
#2017
PLEASE APPLY YOUR MAKEUP LIKE THAT!!!! Oh my lanta that will be a hilariously adventurous video!!!!!!!
You should try the egg brush cleaner. It costs less than $4. Depends on where you buy them. I bought mine for just $1. Kathleenlights uses it
HAPPY NEW YEAR
I was looking at the site and they do have a cleaner for it to use as well. At least they aren't pushing people to buy that. But I would love to own this! Is amazing and would save me so much time
Does she have light green in her hair ?

she scares me and i like it lol
What happend to sweet tea??☹️
LOL!  "Does the 'Like' button really work?"  and "...Look at that. It's like a bad type of ASMR"  😂 Omygosh, I love it!
Yes great science!  Awww  $80😕USD   AND don't get your HAIR caught in the brush - fan at the end vid.
Did anyone else seriously die laughing when she turned on the spinning for the first time at 4:00 😂😂😂
its pronounced like 'feral' with a 'u' sound replacing the 'a', not 'fer-rule' lol!
Bunny is over here doing something productive. While I'm grabbing aimlessly at a blanket looking for a black small hairband/ponytail holder on a black and dark purple blanket. WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE.
I just got this for my birthday and i think one of my brushes is stained blue/green from Halloween eyeshadow :( is there any way to get the stains out? I've washed it so many times with different soaps and then in this product and no luck
you got my first like of 2017!
😍😍😍
It looks like a vibrator
My sisters friend Alison saw you at baybrook mall the other day
Love ya Girl!
this was posted last year
I'd want to rinse them
Every time she's about to try an actual product out on these videos an ad comes on 😩
No...NO.... THE LIKE SYSTEM HAS CONSUMED BUNNY TOO
Bunny did you cut your hair??????????
OMFG pause at 2:07 😂😂
At 4:15 I went to like the video but realized I already had😂😂
Does it ship to the US?
Who watching this in 2017
Could you do one of the water massage tables at the mall
i love to wash my make up brushes
HOW DID THIS GET 128K LIKES IN ONE DAY
Where can you find this because my makeup brushes are so dirty and hard to clean
I also feel as if since it drys to fast you could clean your brushes every other day they would be very very clean
HAHAHAHAH I love your ASMR joke
Your eyes our goals
R ur eyes naturally that blue?
I just watched her today and I already subscribe cause she is damn funny!!😂 thank you bonny for making my day😂🙏🏻
Does anyone know where her sweater is from?
OMG she makes me laugh so hard i love it!
Happy new year
you having earrings on only one ear is driving me crazy
pause at 3:33😂
Happy new yearrr
the reason why u do it out of the water is to dry it
I have said it about 10 times before and I'm gonna say it again. YOU MAY BE THE MOST HIDEOUS PERSON ON YOUTUBE!!!!

3:59 dead af.
You look so cute Bunny :)
she kinda reminds me of lizza
Please try the silisponge foundation applicator. you'll have a field day once you get your hands on it!
the day of the week why did I was waste my time on two of her videos
What part of Texas do you live in
currently waiting for the clock to strike 12 for 2017... what better way to spend it than with bunny!
It would just be so much easier to clean them manually.
alcohol is not a sterilizer...
randoooooom but I'm 14 yrs. old, my height is 5"2, I'm a beginner too so what size of the ukulele should i get??
YOU.DYED.YOUR.HAIR!!!!
it's so funny to watch her act like this in videos because when you meet her in real life she's so chill 😂
Yo theeth at the bottom need a fix up asap
Yes please do the sulisponge
is your hair  have blue and green streeks
Very thankful she dumped the water out
tnx bunny im a filipino and an english learner and i always use your youtube to learn english because you speak english very clearly and you got a good accent although sometimes you speak very fast....but i want you to know that im enjoying also most of your videos....happy new year!
Her eyes 😍
tots buying this thing now
why is there a subscribe to virtuallyvain there?
If you think about it you waste more water using running water when you wash them
Bunny! Are you still going to do "wreck it wednesdays" ? also, happy new year!💚
You should start to do a series called does the like button really work? (DTLBRW)  P.S. I love you bunny!!!
I got an advert right as you went to spin the brush ... ohhh the suspense!!! Haha! 😂
Omg im so happy i end up watching this videos!!! ☺️
In the instructions the amount of water is supposed to be less than where the hairs of the brush meet the handle. so you may have to change the amount of water depending on the brush size
so i got some sonny angels and the where anatomically correct and i swear yours werent it was so awkward to open them infront of my fam at red robin
did u know that you have your own gif as in the keyborf gif
Coooool
how fun!  just under $80?  too much.
first
What the website to buy it ❤😭
trying to tap likes on channels i like whenever they post. it sure gives em some bucks n hell ya get even more awesome vids by tappin like
NEED
why does bunny need likes??
you should do this with a kabuki brush on snapchat!!!
I would use the spinner on a brush texture mat and then also spin it to dry
I want you to do a does this thing really work on the silliesponge PLEASE😩😩
Its nice to see the guy who won The Apprentice in the UK a few years ago is finally having his stuff shipped to the US!!!
Have a go with an Artis brush and let us know how you get on 😂🙈
This chick scares me
ksi rosted you i cant spell sorry
I wonder if you could wash hair like this...definitely would make the drying process easier
you could just wet and put a dab of soap in each of the brushes before putting them in the little bowl and only use enough water to submerge the brush into the water, and then you'd probably waste less soap and less water. I'm assuming that bowl is special to spin the brushes in to keep the water and soap from flying all over the place, so you probably need to use it, but you could just, like I said before, use a small amount of soap in each brush and a small amount of water to not waste either.... I dunno just a thought.
I teehee'd with much glee at the spinning of the dry brush. It seemed to have a tiny topknot in the midst of its twirling!
my mom should get that. we love your videos so much.  im sending you fan mail.  im 7
Hey Bunny! For the soap concern, why don't you try making a soapy water stock where you can get the water from for each wash that way you save soap in the long run since you don't have to keep adding soap to the new water.
I got this for Christmas!!its amazing and I love the smell and feel after use!!i would definitely recommend it💯😍
Why are you begging for likes bunny? :/
Germaphobe
Bunny can you do the glitter make up challenge ? :)
@Grav3yardgirl  did it ruin any of your brushes? I thought they looked less fluffy after you but then through this.
Yes! Please do a review for the sili-sponge
Hey 🐰!! What about rinsing the soap off?? I would def feel weird about not rinsing the soap off with fresh water bc I would worry about the soap leaving a residue in my brushes bc when I'm just cleaning my brushes off the old fashioned way, if any soap gets left inside the  brush hairs, it has an icky feel that I can't deal with and it also makes the brush not work as well... Did you notice anything like that afterwards? My skin is so sensitive and I'm sure rubbing soap residue on with my makeup would not make my face very happy!!Definitely an intriguing product tho bc I LOATHE washing my makeup brushes and this def looks easy and fun! Thanks for the review! You're ridiculous and I love it! ❤️
Has almost 8 mil subs "I didn't  think I'd get to 100k likes"
hi bunny!! I was wondering if I could buy your makeup at any stores? this might be a stupid question but I really don't know😂
You brighten my day with your videos.  Have a very happy new year!
ok,  I know I have been sick and away from you.. I'm sorry Bunny. please forgive me.  however what have I missed? when did you cut your hair?
Who else only got a notification for this today...?
I need this I hate washing my brushes
YOUR EYES ARE SOOOO BLUE IN THIS VIDEO
You should make a whole channel for does this thing really work
I loved her hair action 👌👏👍👍
Well i mean you have 7,000,000 subs so 100,000 like is possible..
I wonder how that would work on artist's paint brushes. Also maybe try makeup remover for the cream foundation brushes?
You know you're a true swamp fam when you say the intro along with her. 😇😇😇
the drying part is just physics :)
Last chance for this comment/ who's watching this in 2016:(
I hate that you scream so much 😒😒😒😒
How are her eyes so blue😍😍😍😍❤️
That's really cool that they were so dry after just 10 seconds!
I was going to do a video on this brush but honestly way to much wrk😑 but she made it look easy haha.
i love your videos i really like your color of your eyes. plz answer me back love youuu!#💙
I can't believe bunny is begging for likes now...
I made a cookie in the shape of a bunny and It is for you
You should do the Spin Brush makeup challenge!!!!! YES! I ITS NOT A REAL THING... until now...,  but you should use the spiny thing with the brush on it and turn it on the apply your make up! LIKE IF YOU AGREE👍🏼👇🏼
You should do a makeup tutorial
are you 50 grav3yardgirl
this video is so calming to me
3:59 best part of the whole video!! Lmaoo
technically you are probably still saving water because you aren't running your water through.
Bunny! Elf makes a daily brush cleaner, it probably isn't perfect but you're supposed to spray it on after you use the brush to held guard against bacteria growing. So you could use it on the larger brushes between cleaning.
I don't think I remember Bunny ever setting a "like goal" on her videos before lmao why is she following that stupid trend now?
Since you use alcohol with your brushes this device would probably be good to clean them normally as you would, then fill it with alcohol and spin then dry them this way. Waiting for brushes to dry is the worst lol
Who wishes Bunny could do a DTTRW on the Handy Heater?
I love your videos bunny 🐰🐰💕💕💕😍😍😍😜
I feel like gyg got old
so this is basically an electric rachet for brushes.
Get a bowl put in in water get a nail gun duck tape it and there
Howdy! I just did my own review and swatches of the Too Faced Sweet Peach Palette! Check it out, you won't be sorry!! Giveaway coming soon, so subscribe!!!!
120 in a day bunny😂♥️
Yes, please
Happy new year Bunny❤❤❤🕛🎆🎇
can you tell us about your Murad experience bunny? I love you ❤
I love your videos
yes
Just ordered my Texas toast lip paint. Love that color bunny. Can't wait to get it in my hands!!!
I would use this as a drying machine after I hand wash my brushes lol
I need this in my life!
bunny please do a reactoin to fake a** gravayard girl pleas
You should do mail again
Is her hair permanently died, if so when did she die it? I love it!!
What about rinsing before drying?
You need to be more conscious about how much plastic products you  Consume we only get one earth bunny 😣
Why not just use a mug for it? Or a dremel to hold the handle?
3>
I love your eyes
Once you start the brush spinning in the bowl....your sounds are soooo well personal sounding
STOP YOU'VE BROKEN THE LAW
You could stick your brush in a drill and use a cup of soapy water. #lifehacks
966 people just stink
silisponge!!
That sounds like a Great idea please do that.(*´ω｀*)
Bunny, which do you prefer for cleaning your brushes? This product, or the brush cleaning robot egg (Lilumia)? I like that this one dries it but like you, the no rinsing or sanitising kinda freaks me out. By the way, if you ever need anyone from the UK to ship things you can't get over there or they won't ship to the US, I can hit you up. Happy New Year.
Nice Hair Color
for cream, you have to use super warm water or it won't dissolve!
4:00 I'm dying 😂😂😂✋🏼
she's literally the ONLY youtuber that I actually press the like button when she asks just cause I love her
yes you should
Happy New Year's Eve
Another youtuber asking for likes?
14:30 that hand gesture
if you're gonna put adds at least put makeup adds....
Is it just cleaning the exterior? I feel like fat brushes take the longest to clean because the makeup settles down inside it. Did it clean inside them too?
Uhh yaassss swamp queenn 👸🏼
I have a theory that it's not the type of makeup that's on the brush, but the problem lies with it being a flat brush. I can see this fishbowl being good for rounder brushes, not so much for flat brushes.
i feel like they should have a larger size to be able to clean several brushes at once but that might be kind of obnoxious
Oh ok... Falangies
Want one but then again, I might just use the electric screwdriver :)
I was like Oh my god IM BUYING THAT then I clicked the link and it's FRICKING £50
try hot wqter on the creams it breaks up oils
What camera do you shoot with?
What camera to you shoot with?
This is the first YouTube video I've watched in 2017 😄 Happy New Year Bunny 👯
not sure if it is just lighting but bunny's hair looks green
Her eyes
yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
What is wrong with her youtube ?? She says likes help🤔❤
I love you grav3yardgirl. the only reason I got youtube is cause you're my favorite and yes you should also what the swamp family I'm a bit new here please reply bunny
Hi Bunny! It seemed !ike a great tool but what about rinsing off the brushes? Doesn't the soap stay in tbhe brush without rinsing them? But cool video XO
The sigma one would have stained mine does that too 😢
Hey Bunny I was wondering what have you been using on your face your skins so nice
please review the silisponge (silicone sponge)
Just for the heck of it you should try and put on your foundation while its spinning
I love her eyes, omg.
Someone got this for me for Christmas, but I don't wear make up. Can I use it for paintbrushes?
You should do a tutorial on how to clean your brushes not using this device... I like embarrassingly rarely clean my eye type brushes.
is she engaged?
(ง ° ͜ ʖ °)ง
So can I just attach my makeup brushes to a drill ?? 😂
U should do it grav3yardgirl
The eyes in the thumbnail are terrifying
Watch my vids for a shoutout!
yeah it worked 💜
X
When did she dyed her hair !!!!!
happy new years every1.have a great 1
700k likes in a day. Cripes, guys!
dirty little brushes
She is so stupid
See the swamp queen palette can u order it and will it ship to the UK? Love u 💚
it should be called fishbowl cleaning, like if you agree!
try using it om a beauty blender for experiment
My favorite part of ur channel is how open u r in ur videos. It makes it more enjoyable by creating this welcoming and funny. Woah that sounded real sophisticated!
I just use platinum Dawn dish soap it works really good but the fact it's dry after is cool since it could help them last longer because the water doesn't get in the other parts of the brush
Ohhh might need to purchase this
Yes you should, it would be cool
Omg you should do something with Jenna marbles, I think It would be awesome!
why is bunny asking for likes? i've never seen her do that
I love Dr. Bronner's for my brushes! However, I wouldn't recommend using almost a teaspoon of it, like the instructions here, because you would drown in bubbles. Your whole house would be bubbles. Stuff is sudsy AF. I'd use about a pea sized drop.
omg your hair is so cute some of it sorta looks blue and it is so CUTE! luv ya😍💕😘😁
I've just kinda been ignoring it for awhile but, what's wrong with YouTube? Bunny keeps saying to like the video to help it...? Does she just want likes or...? Please answer!
Yes you should
Did it leave hairs in the water, after washes?
I went to buy one, and it said it wasn't able to ship to Texas 😭
Can you do a go to Walmart or target with me again
Also to be fair, yeah the water was pretty dirty, but so were your brushes. If you were to clean them every 2-3 uses where they wouldn't be as dirty it would definitely help the water to last longer.
I love bunny she's so funny 😂
#swampfam🐊 #snapfam
I need this in my life...but it is pricey! I would love to see you test out the Silasponge
How does she have a bf i mean I like her but how
Athens first brush u tried cleans really easily anyway lol con
It's like a lil miniature car wash :D
why does this remind me of a washing machine for brushes.
I love the idea of this, but in my opinion nothing beats dollar bar of zote from Walmart and one of those rubber scrubby pads from amazon lol
Her eyes are really really blue
Instead of a get ready it's me you could do a night routine with me
i would just wash it the way i normally do and use this device for drying
hi Bunny, I am letting you know that one of your biggest fans (my husband) Steve passed away on the 28th of December 44 years old. He loved your "Does this thing really work" video's, At times I could hear him laughing from 2 rooms away. I wanted to let you know just how much you touch peoples lives. You sure brightened up his day xxx Love to all the Swamp family xxx https://www.gofundme.com/a-friendly-loving-guy-called-steve?pc=fb_co_shareflow_m&rcid=65bda3fa495b4fa09a773ceb9e2cd225
Are those her real eyes
I ABSALUTLEY LOVE YOYR EYES AND HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎉
You probably save water. Even if you dump water. It's better than leaving the water running
Omg I saw this on Facebook the other day n I was like "yeah they look good on the advert but I want someone like Bunny to do show how it would be to a normal person (in the best of times😂)" n I was like yasssssss when I saw this today
Yes
Did she get a hair cut ??
I really wish I could hit the like button a cazillion times..... Happy New. Year bunny and dog man...xoxo Gilliam from uk
It's my birthday and all I want is for you to like this comment 😭😭😭😭
i love her but why is she always extra
Sanatized
I use Palmolive soap to clean my brushes and sponges and it works great!
You should dry the brush outside of the fish bowl so you don't accidentally put the brush back in the water/soap mix
Realistically, the amount of soap you use each time you use the bowl is probably a lot less than just squeezing a bunch of soap into your hand or onto a scrubbing board. So it'll probably save you soap as well as time.
You would get the sharpest contour if you used that thing for your makeup 😂😂
OMG I WANT THIS SO BAD 😍
ME: does this thing really work!!!!!!!!!!  Mom:are you ok???
How many of you guys actually judge if it works for Bunny b4 buying the item
How many of you guys actually judge if it works for Bunny b4 buying the item
happy new year bunny. I had a question to ask... when are you having another meet and greet? I would really like to meet you ive been watching you for almost 2 years now and I just fell in love with your videos. you helped me through some tough times and would like to thank you.
bunny i love the way you say does this thing really work 😂❤
you smd
Ur sooo funny
do the sillisponge
Now I'm a boy but that looked cool
I would just buy the spinny part to dry my brushes that for me is the biggest reason I don't wash my brushes as often as I should.
Yes, review the sillisponge
Thanks for testing Bunny :D it seems likes a great product to me :)
I like that brush cleaner ..where can I get it ...?? or what website...!!
finally a does this thing really work video!! ^^
Yes!!!!
Early squad
How old is bunny
ты такая уродливая
Love this video! I just ordered this and I'm waiting for it to come in!
Shaaanxo did this but she used a solid soap and only filled it up to half of the brush. It worked great. Might get it
Would any small YouTubers like to support eachother cause I'm gonna start uploading soon and I wanna try and become a decent YouTuber so if someone wants to sub please do❤️
i bet you wont say hi
your eyes are so freaking pretty omg (so blue)
omg
Why exactly is she begging for likes tho??
wow, I've been subbed for years and YouTube had me unsubbed from this channel.. they need to stop.
what? Tati  didn't do a video on this >D? I love your does this thing really work series! Only watch yours!

She should've left your hair blonde... The black is turning blue :(
3:58 omgggg

LOL I LOVE HER THIS IS THE FIRST VIDEO I'VE EVER SENN HER IN AND SHES HILLARIOUS YOU HAVE EARNED A SUBSCRIBER
seven million subs and only six hundred thousand veiws :/ somtin fishy is going on here
crying laughing when you turned the brush upside down while spinning.
oh I want one
Make-up shake!
Great hair style! 💖💞👍
664,664 views 😂😂
Canada is not on the shipping list of countries. Awesome review... got a good chuckle out of the collar comment.
Fun fact, isopropyl alcohol doesn't actually sterilize, it disinfects though! 😻
What about rinsing? I wouldn't be comfortable with just spinning the soap out. I wonder about cream products in a fluffier brush...
I would need to rinse the brushes after
I love you Bunny but this was far far far too long
I've been missing bunny! what up YouTube! I've been subbed forever,  yet you never tell me bunny's new videos are up! WTF! and yes,  notifications are on.
definitely do the silisponge review! && PS whatever happen to the can it curl series??? it was mine and my mom's favorite to watch. love u bunny and have a safe and happy new years! 🐰🎉
Please please pleeease do the silisponge
WOW..you are the most obnoxious human being on the planet...congrats.
Wait she has almost 8 mil subscribers how did she not think she wouldn't get 100k likes???
70% alcool is way better than 90% , i cant explain why in english (not my native language). but trust me xox
I didn't think bunny would start askin for likes
Love this too! Love you! Happy New Year! 🎉❤
Hwy when did you put black back In your hair?!?! Missed it!
so i just looked that product up on like you are correct on that aspect of it being on the pricey side, but I did notice that there were two different cleansers that were offered with the product for additional cost.  Now I was scrolling through to see if they did have a demo on the creams or liquid foundations and so on which they did, but here is the thing.  In the demo he used cleaned water as well as the makeup cleanser product and it came out clean.  Please see link below.  It is thee fourth video down (how to its) if you jump to time frame 2:42 you will see.  https://stylfile.com/products/stylpro   Thanks for taking the time out to tests these products for your viewers!!!!!
Loved watching this and your face😂😂 Love You Bunny💜💄💋🐰
when you and Shan upload the same vid on the same day
ahhh i really really want but its £50 TT
I. Want. This... in my life for 2017!
Are her eyes naturally that blue?😍
Bunny what's your skin scare routine??? Your skin looks flawless!!😍

Are there any other brush spinners on the market? Maybe there are some designed to be able to hold multiple different sizes of paint brushes for artists? I have a hard time believing a product like this didn't already exist in some other form before this concept was marketed for cosmetic brushes. I don't see the point of the bowl. I would just use a sink. Someone suggested taping brushes to a beater or a drill, but it seems like all the time spent on taping would ruin the main appeal of a brush spinner, which is extreme speed and efficiency.
I not only like ur videos... I love them. I always hit like, but why do you have to get a certain amount of like?
She Remind me of Jim Carrey
Yes
I need this!!! It is all over instagram 😏
For cream ones you need to use warm water not too hot
The Wuggle Pet was proabably form a while ago but I just want to throw it out there and you are my favorite youtuber of all time and everyday whan I watch your videos it makes me feel more confident about myself. :) Love you Bunny
Bunny for the next Does This Thing Really Work can you do the Wuggle Pet
I don't get it, why are likes so important all of the sudden?
nine out of ten is good enough  for me.  thanks for the review
We love u bun bun ❤️
So u clip this thing into this thing lol
300,000 Likes and 7,000,000 subscribers.... OMG How Did You Guys Do It -_-
maybe use warm water for cream make up
i love your vids
for does thing really work. you should do an AMIGAMI first impression ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
I have the Artist dupes and I don't believe it'd work for those.
Did it work? The like button
I want this sooo damn bad!!
Would it work for double sided brushes??
Bunny!! If you are ever in California you should change collar with jefree and get ready in his rolls Royce!!!
Where can I get my hand on one of these! I would like to get it for my sis.
I need this product in my life
am i the only one using brushes i havent cleaned in a year ? like am i trash? my skin looks fine
I died when you asked if the like button works x3 didn't even finish the video, came down to comment and like! xoxo
Do one on Alchemists Holographic Palette.
for cream makeup get the stylpro makeup brush cleaner and use that, thats the brush cleaner ive found works best with this device for cream makeup
I use baby shampoo or Castile soap to clean brushes. Super cheap and no breakouts.
put a makeup brush on a drill to apply makeup is probably going to be a trend soon
i hope it works on oil colors and diffrent types of paint but these are way worest that cream makeup i will still use it for makeup brushes though 😂
I see that strategically placed ad >_>
In 2017 I would LOVE to see a collab video with Jeffree Star!
that thing really works !!!!
hope we reach 200k likes it is 105k right now
Yeeee, Silisponge pwease :)
can you do a makeup collection
i was thinking "I'll probably get this" and when she said $80 I *gasped*. YA GIRL BROKE.
<3
They teach millilitres 😂maybe you would be sleeping
it's pronounced like ferl or furl lol. you're cute
how clean your brush gets is all in which cleanser you choose to use. oil dissolves oil. I love philosophy purity for brush cleaning!
Unfortunately the solution that actually cleans the brushes isn't antibacterial. So therefore any brushes you clean after the first one are just being washed in dirty water and not getting properly disinfected. Google other blogger reviews and you'll see what I mean.
😦I can only hit the like once
Love you Bunny and thanks for all the great videos in 2016.! Would love to see the silisponge used. Happy and healthy New Year to you and Dogman!
is she playing a character?
omg omg omg heavy breathing lol brush cleaner!!!
How much is this device
why people in America does not use the water from the tap ??? 🤔🤔
Yes test the silisponge
That seems so awesome
Yes
I love watching your videos!!! I could binge watch your videos for hours
BUNNY! Can you do a "Does This Thing Really Work?!" for the Lilumia brush cleaner and compare it with the Style Pro? LIKE SO SHE CAN SEE!
I want one but I don't want to pay for it 😭
I just love you! I only ever watch the product testing videos but they are bomb!
Awesome!
yes. silisponge
Ummmm I need this lol my sister in law tagged me in a video with this device and I instantly wanted it lol
You might need warm water and a longer soak for the creamier makeup
Why does your hair look blue? Did you dye it??? It looks good 👌🏼👌🏼👍🏼
I think the brushes with the cream products would come cleaner if you used warm water
i would definitely use a brush guard afterward to retain the shape of the brush
i would definitely use a brush guard afterward to retain the shape of the brush
Try using hot water to clean the brushes that you've used cream makeups on.
You're at 100k on this one as of my post!!
how much is that I need it
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😗😗😗😗😗😙😙😙😙😊😊😊😊☺☺☺☺☺☺
I feel like you can save soap and change the water after every brush by just putting a drop of soap on every brush instead of putting soap in the water :-)
what kind of brushes do you use??
I'm getting it just for the drying purpose. It doesn't clean good enough for my liking but, I love that it dries them.      Thanks Bunny! I love you. #Snapchatfam #Everywherefam #Swampfamily #SFS  HAPPY NEW YEAR to you and Dogman   I hope 2017 brings you both many blessings
I would love to see more makeup hurls reviews and grwm's. LOVE YOU BUNNY!
Bye Bye Foundation?
Can I get 10 likes for no reason 😂😂😂😂
Awesome video Bunny! I love this product, and think it looks amazing! I personally don't get to wear makeup that often due to children keeping me busy, but if I did I would TOTALLY buy this to clean the brushes. Thanks for all the awesome videos! You are such a wonderful person and I can't imagine not watching your videos, it would be pure torture! Love You Hun! Keep up the great work! ❤️❤️❤️
Um why is there 800 dislikes?
Omg I want one
i love your earrings, bunny!!
I wish I had hair like you😍
She got her dark hair back?
I can't order this. It goes to shipping method and there are no options and it won't continue. I really wanted to try it and thank you so much for reviewing it but I guess it is a no go for now. 😞 also you could probably put alcohol in the bowl and disinfect the brushes.
I need this thing in my life
Tbh they should have textured the bottom of the bowl to assist cleaning.
I'm not sure why but I can't see any video. It's just giving me sound!? Does anyone else have this trouble?
I think maybe the issue with the cream makeup is that the soap isn't quite strong enough to remove the cream in combination with the speed that the (basically a dremmel) can rotate the brushes. Maybe if you used something stronger instead like micellar water or a makeup remover that you like. This applies to all of you buying it if you come across this issue. Water solubility is definitely a possible issue as well, and probably the reason the cream didn't come off. It could be any number of things. :) hope it works for y'all.
ayyyeeeee it does really work
OMG SHE USED AN EQUESTRIAN PHRASE IN THE BEGINNING! chomping at the bit. YAASSS slay
PLEASE DO CHINESE NEW YEAR MAKEUP😍PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE😘😘😘😘
curl your hair with a conair
It's my birthday can I get 5 likes
Baby shampoo and an oil like tea tree is all you need for cleaning brushes
I can't get it sadly
Uuuuuuu, this is so cool!!!!! Love you!!!😘
that looks awesome and light weight makes me want to just tie my brushes to my hand mixer. 😂😂😂
the videos on the site do say to use cleaning solution for some type of make-up
would it clean better if you used warm/hot water?:)
Shoot, the dry time alone makes me want this
i would throw the water out too 😁😛
"specifacle"
"Did you think the product was in there?" YES BUNNY THANKS FOR TERRIFYING ME
I love your hair
artis brushes are not gonna work... 😡😡😢😢
I really missed the black in your hair.
Aids
Hi Bunny!!!! You are so amazing💖 I know this isn't really related to this topic, but I have really bad anxiety😩 and I haven't found any ways to kinda like release stress. But when I started watching your vids (btw I have been watching you since the beginning) but when I first like knew I had anxiety. I just recently figured out that it helps me so much with my anxiety👍 plz never stop making vids💓 I love you💖
I have artis style brushes, so I guess this wouldn't work for me.
Awesome review!..Thanks for sharing!
I have so many makeup brushes so if I had to dump the water out everytime I cleaned a brush I would use so much soap!!!
I use zoote bar soap for laundry (you can find in the laundry soap aisle at Walmart for about a dollar) (its a large bar of soap) and I use my brush egg (you can buy a brush egg on amazon) to clean my brushes then I lay them flat on a towel and let them dry overnight
I just wanted to say thank you to Bunny. I used to have a YouTube channel when I was 24, I loved it enjoyed being a youtuber. Then some girls from my old high school found my channel and not only disliked all my videos and commented really nasty things on every one, they made multiple accounts to do it, they would screen shot me when I looked fat and put it on their instagram pages (even though they new I was struggling with an eating disorder). It wasn't healthy for me so I deleted it. I'm 27 years old now, a wife, a new mom, I still fight my ednos every day but I'm winning. I started this YouTube channel. You are an amazing person Bunny, I love how positive you are. You are you and that's so inspiring. You made a difference in my life, thank you.
At 4:57 pause her face.
this would be great just for drying the brushes, you could wash them like you always do without having to change the water every time and then just spin dry them in the bowl. It would save a lot of time as well.
Interesting! I like how you did a second brush with less water on second try! Cool product!
hi, i'm new here 😏 i'm super confused; some time ago, i watched guytang remove that black dye from her hair, and now it's here again...did she dye it again?
OMG YASS QUEEN!!! yesterday i was like "she hasn't done a does this thing really work in ages!!!" YAYYYYYYYYY YOU DID ONEEEEE!!!
FINALLY!!!!!!! I have been WAITING for this video ever since I saw this product come out!!!
Okay is it just me or was watching the brushes get clean and whatnot kinda satisfying?? No? Just me? Okie dokie. 😂
I usually use Estée Lauder brush cleaner but I might get this and maybe use baby shampoo... sounds like it would save me loads of time!
HEYY ANY SMALL YOUTUBERS WANNA SUPPORT EACHOTHER AND BE FRIENDS?? HMU!!👑😋
Oooooooh Bunny is so close to a diamond play button! 🙊✨Keep subbing Swamp Fam!
The ferrule is also the metal part of a pencil that holds the eraser on :)
Actually this wastes very little water if you were washing on the sink with running water.
Have a fantastic New Year 🎉🎉🎊🎊🙂
Shut up
I barely even wear makeup but Bunny got me watching a vid of cleaning makeup brushes! Love ya Bunny <3
very curious about sillisponge. would love to see what you think
Yes u sould
it might actually save water if you usually wash your brushes under running water. say you ran the faucet for 10 seconds, full blast. I think it would end up being more water than what you used per brush with this product.
I love your eyes there like the ocean
i love you bun im 7 years old
Ok, I made it 99,432...
can we please get that dollskill hurl video pleeeaaaaseee
YAAAS SUCH HAPPINESS SEEING THIS
I would have used the same water for a first wash of all brushes (I think I'd change it once or twice if I had more than 5 brushes), then I'd use fresh water with soap for a second wash and then for the third time I'd only take water to get all of the soap out of my brushes.. I mean I also rinse off the soap if I wash my hair, so I'd like to rinse it off my brushes too :D
You are great bunny and you are so amazing in many different ways I love you so so much you videos are so entertaining ❤❤❤❤😍😍😋😋😋
Omg I love you Bunny 🐰 you're so hilarious and amazing!!
I NEED THIS OMG
Yes I think you should definitely  do that
No, Bunny. I totally get it! I would have to change that water too.
Pleaseeeeee try the silicone sponge!
THE LIKE BUTTON DOES REALLY WORK!!
buttttt shouldnt you rinse the soap out afterwards...?
as of right now 98k
Is bunny in financial debt or something looking for all these likes
We will always love && support you, bunny. 🐰
What happened to the "will it curl" segments ?
In every video of you I fall at least once off my bed because I laughed too hard.. :D
i need me this bc im lazy af lol
Her eyes are soooo unreal its so beautifull
Is it just me or does her hair look blue? (No hate I love bunny I'm just wondering)
My YouTube subs not coming up at all anymore wtf is going on
I got this for Christmas. It workss
Do Lil outrageous littles toy pls
the 1% who sees the comment wish you a very happy new year
Bunny and all of the people watching this video HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
Do Lil outrageous littles pls
You're supposed to spin it in clean water with no soap then dry it
-Pats self on the back for knowing "makeup terms" -Immediately mispronounces ferrule
your eyes are always so pretty. 😍❤
when you know the intro off by heart
99% won't read this but to the 1% that do I hope u have a beautiful and wonderful day
i would use clean water too!
..try to clean the Concealer Brush with hot water..
3:58 <3
How much is this device?
more than 60$ for a plastic bowl and soap it's robbery
do more will it curl video!!!!!
the moment I heard it was made in the UK.. I knew it'll be a winner 👌✋😂
"Does the like button really work?!" Lmao love that
I love the brush cleaner and yes I would love to see the silicon sponge thing. I have 3 daughters and thinking these products would make great gift ideas for next year Xmas. Thank you Bunny.
The rule of thumb with soap is: If there are bubbles/froth, it still has cleaning power. No bubbles - no cleaning effect.   I would probably do one round with all my all brushes in the same water, don't dry them (or just short 3 seconds) and then give them another wash in fresh water/soap and dry them. For the second round I would change the water more often...
not a hater well good luck :-)
cool😀
Anybody else remember 'somebody call vogue' ??
It makes me think of a car wash
Who-ever dislikes this is not a Swamp-family member or lover also my friend from HighSchool did fanart for you bunny but she did it like last year I think so thank her for introducing me to you!
Why were you in YouTube Rewind ??
You can clean your brushes with baby shampoo and water. Also I hope you recycle that water bottle.
for the creamy make-up it says on the website that brushes come clean from cream make-up only using their soap -.-"
plsss do the silispongeee
I clean brushes with olive oil then soapy water....would this work if you put oil in it for the stubborn creams?????
DO A HOUSE Tour
I understand washing they with soap but did they mentioned rinsing with clear  water after the soapy water?!
how does this girl have 7.9 million subs ?
You deserve every like and every view that you receive cos I think the entire world should know you and the happiness that you gave to all the swamp family! Thank you! Kiss from Italy
5:00 I use _Clorox Bleach_, it's safer.
Pause at 5:20
I don't even own make up brushes as I barely use make up ....  But I love watching DTTRW xD
i think it didn't work on that concealer brush bc it's flat and can't spin properly
That would be nice even to just dry your brushes cause i hate how long they take to dry
bunnyd hair looks blueish
I don't use make up but I do a lot of watercolour painting - I wonder if this would be good for cleaning my paint brushes...?
Need this for my paintbrushes :)
Yes do the silicone sponge!
i've been watching this series for ages and I still get excited the same when i first saw it
She should do a series called " Using Things For what They're Not Supposed To Use For". I know it's long but it's shorter if spoken. :)
I think the stylpro probably works better on round brushes, cause I think with flat brushes the soap and water might not penetrate the bristles as it spins as much as it would the round brushes... idk if I'm making sense but I think that's why the flat brush didn't work as well
HEY BUNNY I LOVE YOU, YOU ARE SO HILARIOUS💖YOU SHOULD DO DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK? FOR A MINI DRONE😊
Your the craziest and weirdest youtuber ever u suck grav
will this work solely for the purpose of drying brushes? You could wash brushes that you use to blend liquid or cream products with your usual routine and then you dry them by spinning them for 10 secs as you would do in the last step of this device?
Shouldn't brushes be rinsed after they are washed?
i thought it was pronounced 'fa-rel'  not farool
maroto que é maroto, dá like antes de começar o víde... oops, wrong channel 😆
You can use a little water/soap at a time I've seen that work. The recommended solution amount just change out the water progressively.
Bunny can u plz do a house tour xxx💓💓💓 i would really appreciate it ??!!
Adding a little Dettol or Savalon would make the liquid antibacterial, and certainly you could wash more than one brush at a time.  I saw it in my local pharmacy and am now sorely tempted to get it.
Would be tempted to buy it just so my brushes dried faster xD
the likes
Dammm so late in the game with this brush cleaner I know about 4 about 1 year now....
Ugh this looks so good and amazing for my big brushes! I need this in my life D:
you can buy a real electric drill and a fish bowl for under 40 XD
https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/Disinfection_Sterilization/6_0disinfection.html
Awww I wish I knew about this before Christmas because now I really want one 😆
I would like to see you review those "Dial Vision" glasses on your As Seen On T.V.  segment or Does this thing really work. I my wife and I trust your opinion on those products that seem too good to be true.
BUNNY!!!!  Have I really missed that much?????? have you dyed your hair blue????? ive missed way to much
Or could I just stick my brush iinto my electric drill and spin it around in the sink? :)
You sould use a sope that reamoves oil when you are cleanig a Brush with Cream produckt on
Idk why but this was oddly satisfying to watch this
There's a reason most professional makeup artists hate this thing 😳😬 it's just an expensive way to ruin your brushes.
She doesn't know what she is doing, go watch Shaaanxo's video 💕
reminds me of a car wash
bunny, I love you girl. I've been watching you for 4 years.. but this begging for likes on videos is getting frustrating now. 😒
her hair is atrocious omg jesus
the only brushes i can think of that it wouldn't be able to clean is the artis type brushes and those wide flat contour brushes
Please make more of Does This Thing Really Work?!?  They are my absolute favorite!!  I love you!  😙
I got this for Christmas I absolutely love it 😍
i wouldnt use the small bowl,i think it would still work in a sink. js!! really would luv to have this
your video helped me calm down from the hospital so thank you for all that you do
I dont get why she asks for likes so intensely now..? Ik there is a reason why but idk it
did anyone else notice her one earring??
Heya Bunny, Not sure if you watch Pewdiepie, but he's been experiencing the same thing with YouTube. After talks with them, the new algorithm is all about views and re-views. So getting people to watch your video and then go and watch another one. Apparently 'likes' don't mean anything? Love watching your videos, and hate what YouTube are making my favourite Tubers do. Have a great 2017. xxx
So much better than that alien egg thingy 😂
I love the clips after the byeeee. It's like little bloopers. You're terrific bunny!
Yes please do
It's look cool
will you please do the charcoal and coconut oil toothpaste thing
I think you can wash all brushes in one portion of soapy water, and then wash them in individual portions of clean water. I can't believe that there is no soap resedue after washing in soapy water.
She's makes me laugh so much 😂 love ya bunny 😙💜
I TAGGED YOU IN THIS VIDEO ON FACEBOOK!
*I JUST POSTED THE EXACT SAME VIDEO TODAY SOOOO WEIRD!!!!!! 😱😱😄😄*
I'd be kinda worried about soap residue, since there's no rinsing? I get that it spins most off but.... Still this looks cool! Reminds me of a tiny car wash!
Wouldn't work for the Artis brushes, which I have. Boo. :D
It's worth it just for spinning them dry after washing brushes the normal way.
Is it just me or are her eyes like.. Unusually blue?
Hi
💗 u bunny
Yes, do the Sillisponge.
You have to change the water after brush otherwise it's not hygienic. Huge design flaw.
I tried to get this and it didn't work for me, no shipping options came up.. what the heck.. I am in arizona lol.. not far from texas at all... ::walks away crying::
Less than a teaspoon. Teaspoons are 5ml, so a little less than a full teaspoon 😏💁🏼
I just tape my brushes to my hubbys drill bit and guess what get free Lol
I'm laughing so hard
Why are all you tubers asking for likes? Does it help them get something?
her hair looks amazing she is my inspiration best YouTube er ever
I love your hair
What if you used the vibrating brush handle thing along with your silicone mat instead of the "fish bowl"
Dear Bunny,  Thank you so much for making these videos for us. Today my mom passed away from a coma because she had no brain function. I miss her. We had a really tight relationship. Your videos have gotten me through a lot of tough times. You're positive and funny and help others stay positive. I know that god did it to let her Rest In Peace with no pain. I get bullied in school because people don't like my opinions so they push me and shove me. My mom would help me deal with that and now that she is gone I only have my dad. He has never been bullied so he doesn't have any advice so watching your videos remind me that I have to stay strong. You keep me positive. Thank you so much.                                  Sincerely,                                   Sameeha
Where can I find this Bunny....please ... I really want to try...
She has such amazing eyes tbh ❤️
Omg you're amazing I love you
Can you do another giveaway please💜
clean a fish
i really like your hair
wow, brush cleaner and vibrator all in one 😂😉😆
Can you do a video of your normal brush cleaning routine! I feel like your routine is SUPER sanitary (of course!) and could help us so sooooo much!
I CANT BELIEVE THIS. I'M HERE SINCE SHE HAD 640 SUBSCRIBERS. OML.
WHY WAS THIS RECOMMENDED?
Yes on the silisponge
we use baby shampoo to clean CPap supplies, plastic and silicone parts, with the exception of anyone who might be sensitive,  that might be a cheaper solution.
old your channel is getting old is what i ment
your kinda getting well your channel is
Bunny, I absolutely LOVE your jumper! 😍
you should try the diy wash board for makeup brushes where you put the hot glue on a clip board and use that to clean them
or just rinse in water first... then do the 2nd with soap and water
Ok so how much does it cost?
Bunny, i like u, but stop begging for likes, it's embarrassing
please do a where your boyfriend does your makeup
You're hair is cool in this video.
I love how bunny pronounces the ferrel of the brush!!😂😂💗 (if anyone's wondering, most people pronounce it as like merrel) 😂😂
I love you so much and I really appreciate how you pay attention to your fans and care about them
I think the guide maybe has the water line cause it varies for each brush as smaller ones need less water than the big ones, so the water line varies
Yessssssss
The beauty blender solid cleanser/Sephora solid cleanser is the only way I can clean my brushes completely
Yes please I love does this thing really work videos sorry for commenting late
I'm too lazy to do research, so I'm going to ask fellow SF this: WTF happened to her hair!? Idk if it's me, but her hair looks like she spray painted it! Love the channel though! I hope some day, you'll do a Follow Me Around at IKEA Houston or Round Rock!
This is freaking awesome!! definitely gotta get one!
Liked at 88k 💕
Love the swamp fam ❤
you should do the  24 hour challenge
you people disliking the video keeping bunny from being able to get 200,000 likes (PITY them JK)
grav3yardgirl u are so funny. complament
Quick question, I'm really curious why bunny keeps asking for so many likes. I'm not at all being mean, I'm just curious. I love bunny so much!! ❤❤❤
👌
You always make me laugh 😂❤😄
how many swamp family members hit the like button before even watching the video, because let's be honest everything Bunny makes is gold and you know that. lol
Bunny's started begging for likes :(  Now she's screaming "CAN WE GET ____ LIKES?!" like all the other slimy Youtubers, as if her almost 8 million subs aren't enough
You could always use the same water, wash all the brushes, change the water, wash them all again, change the water... until the water comes out clean for the last brush. I don't feel like my brushes are clean until the water I wash them in is clear, anyway.
Well if you think about it isn't that the amount of water you would use to clean the brushes by hand compared to if you had to keep replacing the water after each brush. Idk I wouldn't find it wasteful. I'm sure I'd waste more water by keeping the faucet running to clean my brushes.
Who is watching this in 2017
Are there any winter items that you can use for 'does this thing really work?!'
I really like your hair and the amazing colours😄😄
You could use one thing of water and wash all the brushes, and then use fresh water to rinse them. That way you can rinse off the soap and save water at the same time. TBH whenever I try castile soap like Dr. Bronner's it leaves a film. I started using ivory dishsoap and it works amazingly.
you and Shaaanxo just posted a video on the same product 👌👌
Hmmmm... it looks like after a while it would mess up your brushes. And brushes aren't cheap. And it looks like it wouldnt cut down the time it takes to clean the brushes. I dunno. Seems pricey anyway.
I would want to rinse the soap off then spin to dry
i love bunny, but why does she photoshop her eyes to appear bigger in her thumbnails?
the drying part is just like magic!
I feel like I could use this for paint brushes too. I don't wear make-up, but I paint a lot and anything to help the cleaning progress would be great.
I bet guy tang watched this and sobbed.  😢 lol
❤❤❤😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
i did not know that you gave your hair blacks streaks. I looks very cute on you
Pause at 1:29, you will thank me later. Caption that.😂😭🙌🏻
How would that work with a flat foundation brush or a dual ended brush?
I wouldn't use this to wash per se but I'd LOVE spin-drying my brushes so they dry faster.
Bunny I love you so much ! But please don't do the begging for likes thing. It really doesn't suit your class ! <3
I go to a private school and all the students there are all blonde, blue eyed spoiled brats. I get bullied for being a brunette, brown eyed spoiled brat.
Reminds me of the spin mop and I love that mop!
Did she dye her hair kinda blue or is it just me? sorry I haven't watched in a little bit
Her eyes are so blue
Did anyone else want her to do eyeshadow brushes like a flat eyeshadow brush, a blending eyeshadow brush and a pencil brush
Sub to this_human
Love thissssss
You can clean them with "normal" soap and then ones again with your good stuff soap the 2nd time and lesser soap.
I don't even use makeup and still I watch! Love you, Bunny, and happy new year!
What brand is that adorable yellow brush from?
i need this in my life
I would do all my face brushes in a quick run through with the same water. Then do them again in clean water, with a portion of alcohol for sanitizing in the second go. Seems faster and more efficient to wash them twice, than to fill the bowl for every brush.
Omg you should try applying foundation with this 😂
I love your videos,they are so energetic
What exactly does liking the video do?
Yeah
I was wondering about this, thanks for sharing. Happy new year to you and your family.
I'm so glad you tested this! awesome! thanks! and I'm so glad you are testing the silicone makeup sponge. I just saw it yesterday and was going to suggest it to you :)
@graveyardgirl Bunny make a big container of soapy water and then pour a little in for each brush
Bunny could literally do ANYTHING and I will still be entertained...... 😃😆
you should do a does this thing really work ! on airbrush makeup ! lol love u ❤️
You could do this with a drill 😉
i use dishwasher soap to clean my brushes xD
I just wanna say, Bunny is a beautiful person inside and out. It always bothers me when people comment things like "her eyes are creepy" (by the way, their beautiful. Very striking, was one of the first things I noticed about her.) and comments like "I miss the old Bunny" bother me too. I feel like as long as she's comfortable, that's all that matters. I'm not looking for sympathy here, I just want to prove my point, but last year I had a really rough year, I won't go into specifics, but I remember the first time I clicked on a Grav3yardgirl video. It was a really bad day, I remember sitting in the bathroom at my school and crying, and I pulled out my phone and turned on a SimplyNailogical video (Holo, any holosexuals out there reading this comment?) anyway, I was watching Cristine try pell off gel nails, and decided to check out the video she was referring to with Bunny. I can't tell you the feeling of complete and utter happiness Bunnys enthusiasm gave me. And I still get that feeling every time i see a video from her in my subscription feed, or get a notification that she just uploaded a new video. I absolutely love her, the sound of her voice has become relaxing to me, I don't care what she's talking about, I just like the sound of her voice. It makes me feel safe. Sometimes I rewatch old videos of her, simply because she makes me feel happy, I honestly love everything about her, I love that she doesn't try and make herself seem perfect, I love her eyes, her smile, her voice, her style. Everything. (I mean "I love you" in the most platonic way possible.) but it's because of theses reasons that I love Bunny, rather it's old Bunny or new, she's perfect. I'm a proud member of the Swamp Family.
My cat literally watched 90% of this video with me. I've never seen him pay attention to any videos before. Maybe he liked the vibrating sound? 😂 It's a very cool device! Although, I don't wear make-up enough to warrant spending $80 on it. Also, I agree with other ppl. Definitely should do a rinse cycle with no soap.
Why does she keep asking for likes recently ? Did I miss something
what is the thumb nail
Please keep in mind that water travels EASILY up and into the ferrule if you even dunk it close to the ferrule. Absorbency and all that.. so don't dunk it far.
+grav3yardgirl I would be interested to see if you could get like a Brita or ZeroWater water filter and dump the dirty water in there so you can reuse the water to not feel like you are wasting so much. Curious if that would work. Also to preserve the longevity of your brush, while being sensitive to your skin and get rid of germys you should try using Dial Gold soap. I have such sensitive skin that even natural makeup makes me break out sometimes, but I use this soap for my brushes and it works great and is pretty inexpensive :)
aren't u supposed  too rinse  out the soap from the brushes??
you   go   girl
I would get a couple of glasses. Line them up. And then spin a marathon.
Test vintage makeup!!!
I feel like really what we need is a cleaner thing that washes a bunch of them like that egg shaped thing but spin dries them like this thing. Get on it people. I want to put in minimum effort and min personal time. XD
Am I the only one who now realized how FILTHY my brushes are 😂 I hardly ever wash them and now I'm disgusted because that's much more product build up. Kudos to her for being so consistent in washing
Hope you Have a fantastic New Year! 🎉
I would love to see you test out the silisponge ! I know Molly Cosmetics is a small indie company, and they were very overwhelmed with how many people ordered at once. I know they update their backorders almost daily on their Instagram page.
This looks like really good product to have.  I think I might have to splurge and get one.  Also, I think I would like to see you do a DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK for the SILLISPONGE.  YA never know till ya try it!  Or at lest, till Bunny try's it for us!  Lol
YOUR EYS R BUTIFUL I WISH I HAD YOUR EYES
For a video can you do the non dominant hand makeup challenge please it will be so fun to watch.
LOL! I would not have been able to wash another brush in that dirty water either! Just like a bath, I don't consider myself clean after sitting in my own body oils and dead skin cells.
bunny.... i love you. i really do. but i aint gonna like your video just cause you beg. and why do you even need a ton of likes? just curious cause i dont know why you need them so bad
i love your earrings!!!!!
yes!! ive been debating buying the silisponge! def do a review asappp! love you bunny girl!
She's weird but in a good way😜
Yes doll, do the silly sponge!
bunny it's 1 in the morning and I can't sleep so here I am watching all of your videos😂 love you bunny❤🤘
I'd like to see this used with a sigma f80 or something really thick and extremely hard to wash!!! Those brushes seriously take me forever to get every last bit of gunk out!!!!
So I've been on a Heath Ledger movie spree for the past two days and it was making me all sad. This video made me smile and feel a little better :) even though I'm totally going back to watching those movies now... lol
what did you do to your hair? I loved the way guy tang did it it looked sooooo good.
Bunny doesn't need makeup she's already beautiful
I'm so glad she switched the water 🙌
"I'm missing some collars...that's an odd phrase to say in a video" 😄😄😂
i've been watching Bunny for two years and I just realized I wasn't subscribed....geez
Hey Bunny! You may not see this, but your video was in my recommendations today! Honestly, with a different account I was subscribed to you, but wasn't on this one. I hadn't watched a video of yours in a while, but I saw the past couple due to you showing up in my recommendations and I've subscribed again! Love your great personality (and eyeshadow palette, and in the future, your lip paints that are in the mail to me!)!! Have a wonderful day!!
It's my sisters birthday can I get at least one like
You reminded me to clean my makeup brushes :D
Just FYI....soap molecules work by attracting dirt. So as you use your brush on your face (because it still has soap on it) you'll be putting soap on your skin which will attract dirt all day. So it might be a good idea to repeat the washing procedure again,  without soap in the water. At least,  that's what i would do:)
Don't you need to rinse them to get the soap of them? @grav3yardgirl
I agree about being skeptical about the water being clean after washing the first brush. however my biggest concern is that its just drying the soap into the brush. wouldn't it need to be rinsed more? but hey at least it worked 👍👍
I have a feeling that most of the make up would fly off the brush before it got to your face... Liquid foundation might work, but powders would probably be thrown off.   And ferrel is said like feral. lol... Fehrule. I know what a ferrel is, but I wasn't aware they used the term for paint and makeup brushes. I know it from wood handled weapons and tools.
Just wanted to say your skin looks GREAT in this video, Bunny! 😍
she mentioned cleaning the second brush in the dirty water and I cringed so hard. Then she decided against it and u haven't been so thankful in a long time. I too spray 90% rubbing alcohol on my brushes. OCD and germaphobe ✋
It does look like a fish
Easy dupe for this! Fish bowl, drill, done deal! I'm poor.
I'm so jealous of your hair, swamp mom
I just subscribed ur sooo halarious I'm part of the SWAMP FAMILY. YAY!!!!!
Lol
Why is Bunny so concerned about getting likes these days? smh
Creepy eyes.....
Think you should try lukewarm or a little warmer water for the creamy make-up. Don't know why I think that, I don't use make-up, bu I paint pictures and stuff, and i usually use lukewarm to warm water with tougher, more "fatty" products. Just don't *ever* use hot or boiling water as they can ruin brushes (especially if they are nylon/plastic) and/or loosen the glue holding the hair. I know this thing is for make-up, but I would buy it for my paint brushes hahah! Damn I would save a ton of time. :P
lolol i clean my brushes only when they're too dirty to be functional x_x
yes you should test it. Happy New Year to you and Dogman.
sadly grav3yard girl your videos are slowly going more down hill by the day
that is so cool
oh no shes become one of does youtubers that sets a like goals that sucks
I got ten minutes into this video and then realized that artis brushes wouldn't work with this...
How much is this thing
my main problem with washing brushes is drying them
I Love Ur Eyes Bunny
I want two bowls. One for soapy water and one for plain water. I would totally buy one for my art brushes as well!
i love you so much i subscribed
I was at Walmart today and saw two products I'd love for you to try. Yes to Tomatoes Activated Charcoal Beauty Bar and Yes to Carrots Hair Conditioner.   Both of these seem outrageous and I'd really like to know your opinion on how both smell and work. Please please please please!
the centrifugal force should probably push off all the water whether it is dirty or not
Yes! Silicon sponge!
I do not like gimmicky gadgets but if this goes for a decent price I might actually get this. I can never get a deep clean in my brushes and the spin just be the thing to do it! This is why I love your does this thing....segments. You sold me on this one! Thanks bunny love you happy new year!!
Thank you so much for doing a video on this. I was just watching other videos on the Stylpro and wasn't impressed by their demos. I do think you had too much water in the bowl (my opinion). The other issue that kept coming up in my mind was wanting to rinse the brushes in clean water after cleaning them using the device. I feel the same about dumping out the dirty water each time. Thanks Bunny!
it may not work so well with concealers that are creamy and oily, water and oil are not besties basically. perhaps try as an experiment some oil in the brush cleaner thing, i sometimes clean my stuff with olive oil first and then use a normal brush cleanser to makes sure its all clean.
it's like a minie washing machine
this is my fav time for bunny
ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

Too much water maybe? Lol
s
Do a does this thing really work you should try the straight up brush it kinda looks like it works
is there a reason she asks for likes all of a sudden? feel like I missed something
I wish you had done a kabuki brush.
The reason it doesn't have a fill line in the bowl is because different brushes have different hair lengths. The picture for how much to fill the water is showing you not to fill the water higher than half of the height of the bristle length of the brush you are cleaning.
Baby shampoo dollar store
I've watched you forever, me and my mom adore you.
If you are a wine drinker (and get headaches from them like me) can you try that item that is supposed to remove sulfites from wine to keep you from getting headaches! thanks!
If you do not like how it cleans your brush, you can still use it to dry yung brushes after washing it your own style. hahaha Niffty!
bunny, i just wanted to say i love your amazing, big personality just so you know i was your 111 subscriber
woh are her eyes naturally that blue?
I want this
they do say that you should use a different soap for the cream makeup. cause of the different consistency or something. either way, this makes me want this product more.
whenever a YouTube blatantly begs for likes I dislike.
I feel like it's not that wasteful to dump the water out and use another 8th teaspoon to do another brush each time.. because imagine hand washing and how much water and soap you would probably end up using then. I always absent-mindedly use too much soap. I feel like I'm kinda into this thing.
This video was kind of satisfying.
Your eyes😍
Liked it just for you, Bunny 🐰❤👑
You say "ferrule" of the brush so funny. I love you bunbun
who else just noticed that she looks like Christian Olivers
I could not use a brush that has not been rinsed with just plain water.
Did anyone else notice her wearing safety pins on her right ear?
Okay. From what I read, you can def use a lot less water and soap than what you are using. And they suggest for creams, eyeliners of that sort, they suggest their cleaning solution. Can you get us a coupon code?
your videos make my life
What camera does she use? please help
I love your videos but they're always way too long
where can you get this it's amazing
Is that an "engagement" ring underneath your normal dogman ring? Swamp Family am I nuts?
that just looks fun lol
This is so cool. I feel like this is one of the better makeup brush cleaners😱😱
yeah you should
Isn't it against youtube's rules to ask for likes like that?
omg omg omg Yas. I'm so happy you made this!!!!!
I want to use it for my art brushes :D
TBH id rather just wash my brushes like normal, but use this contraption to dry them afterwards. I wouldn't want to go through all of the dumping the water, refilling it, waiting ten seconds, etc etc etc. and I wouldn't want to use the same water either, so I'd find it easier to wash all of my brushes as I do, make sure they're clean, then dry them with that.
washing machine for makeup brushes
519 people have no soul or humor... 😂😂😂 We love Bunny in this house!
I think I would wash my brushes by hand and just use the bowl apparatus to dry them. Because drying is the worst part for me. I always worry that water is seeping into the ferrule and being able to have them dry in 10 seconds is so helpful
I use the Brush Shampoo and spray cleaner from Sephora, but this looks like fun.  If only it was a bit cheaper.
You probably use less water than finding them off under the running tap. Interesting product
1 second in..  Me: hits like button😙🐊
You have the absolute bluest eyes I have ever seen.  They're insane.  Not even CGI can compete.  They're simply stunning.
literally screamed at 1:02
You should put alcohol in the bowl and do a rinse for your brushes in it.
the amount of water is so that the water doesn't get into ferrule and possibly lossen the glue which would cause the bristles to fall out. so it all depends on your brush
Not even watching the video but what does she do to her eyes in the thumbnail? Trippy!!
Wait, didn't Bunny spend a long time trying to get the dye out of her hair? Why is it back?
She literally yells everything :/ it's hard to listen to, which is a shame because she is so funny.
OMG I NEEED THIS PRODUCT IN MY LIFE RIGHT MEOW
interesting
wait, aren't you like 50?
What's happening to u tube?!?! Why is everyone worried and asking for likes? Can some on help?
you rock Bunny!! ♡
"specifical" ...thank u for that
Looks like it ruins the brushes more than anything. Just use a blow dryer or something.
I'm sooooo considering buying this now....washing brushes is SUCH a hassle. It's extremely necessary but so time consuming
Who else was watching this while rocking a sassy bun
As Seen On TV Jerome Alexander MagicMinerals Make Up Set
What if you used warm/hot water, instead if room temp.
Meh.
Please be careful! I know one of those cleaning things has chemicals that should not be used by humans!
I love watching your videos but your face scares me so much.
OMG SHE SOUNDS LIKE DORIS FROM FINDINGER DORIS
does anyone know the second brush she was using? the black handle with the rode gold barrel?
Yay the like button works😂👍🏼
hey you should try a fidget cube, it's a godsend for people with anxiety!! it helps me so much :)   I also bought my very first makeup pallet, and it's the swamp queen pallet. I'm super excite!!!!!
I can't wait for a Chinese company to come out with a knock off. Edit: This looks like a downy ball. The only thing you have to do is come up with something to twist the brushes with. What do you guys think could be used?
Thanks for always cheering me up Bunny! You are awesome and I need this brush cleaner stat, lol
Mix water and soap  in a different cup and pour into container after each
Omg I was going to get this but then I saw it was $63 so yeah um nope
SHE KEPT PRONOUNCING FERRULE WRONG
This is so cool 😭😭😭😭😭 I want one now 😭
it's like a car wash for your make up brushes
you have the most prettiest blue eyes
the way she says falange
ur brush is a fish
Its actually pronounced fair-el not fur-rule 😂😂
i like ur hair
Bunny, thank you.   I watch your videos while I wash dishes and iron clothes.   You make my boring chores fly by!   I get such a kick out of you.   Love and hugs from Niagara Falls Ontario!
You should do DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK for The Right Cup from Indiegogo 🙏🏻
i actually think it saves water, compaired to washing under running water.
maybe you can put the alcohol in the bowl and use the same process to sterilize and dry the brushes as well.
Can someone please explain to me why the "likes" are so important for the video? Honest question..
i would maybe spray a sanitizer on the brushes afterwards so its not soaking, but still disinfected.
I feel like the best way to use this would be to have two bowls, one for soap and one for plain water to rinse with. 😊
She only has one earring lol
Do you still use your Lumia?
who else liked the video before even watching
YES!! Really Enjoy Watching these -- Does This Thing Really Work-- Videos!!!
It is better to change your water each time. I can't get over your 7 million followers! You just had  a million when I first found you. I like using organic soap. FYI, i use a rubber band to wrap my brush on a Dremil tool or drill! Cheap and easy. :-)
Yes please Bunny!!!
Not rinsing the brushes with clean water would drive me crazy!
Are your irises real?
anyone else just feel like you could use your power drill?
I think I saw this on Facebook and thought, "Bunny should try this" lol
In min 4 she made me laugh so much 😂😂😂
I love ur hair straight!!!!
I need this for my paint brushes
I am weird but I have always wanted to see the likes at 1 million
I want one of these. These are awesome.
Seriously so funny when you turned it on with the brush going flat lol!
Chomping at the bit.. lol. Only those of us of a certain age remember that expression.😊😊
I got a wubble bubble for Christmas and today I poked it and it got a hole to I tried to seal it up with the seal sticker and bounced it and it popped
how much is this? ????
my sister is a makeup artist and she actually uses baby shampoo to clean hair brushes. she uses the same system with a baby shampoo with all the brushes first then uses her makeup cleaner with antibacterial in them after. she only changes the water on the end of bacteria cleanser after three brushes because the baby soap cleans them first and now she's just sanitizing them
Hey Bunny Something I learned when our inspector came in ( Im a hair stylist) was that anything over 70% alcohol really does nothing as it's so high that it evaporates to fast. He said to use 70-71% only as it stays long enough to kill any potential bacteria.
I am definitely getting this product !!!!
"I'm going to actually follow the directions this time!" *Immediately does a step 4 times longer than directed*
I wonder if this would work for cleaning paint brushes....
I feel like it would work, you just need to rinse with water after and then "dry it" again but no need to get new water
We need to do it again!!!!
I wonder if you put alcohol in the bowl for your cream based makeup... it might work. I was worried at the end of the video, I envisioned the brush grabbing your hair and twisting it into knots. Thank you for sharing and have a Great New Years Eve!
I have a solution for the soap problem! Try the process with pure water one time through for all your brushes then repeat with soap (not changing the water every time) that way the water stays clean longer. Kinda like how you hand wash dishes
OMG!! YES PLEASE:D
is she always this over the top?
YOUR EYES
I LLLOOVVVVEE YOUR SSWWEEAATEERRR
omg this could work for my paint brushes. omg. omg. omg.
what about warmer water for wet products
LOL WHEN YOU SPINNIED THE FIRST BRUSH YOUR FACE JUST LIT UP!! I LAUGHED FOR HOURS! :)
OMG GIVE ME YOUR EYEBALLS!! THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL!! I WANT THEM!
you could just wash them yourself and dry them in that
your hair looks dark teal instead of black lately. hmmm did you recolor it?

i usually do one part extra virgin olive oil (or coconut oil) and one part antibacterial dish soap on a plate to clean my brushes and i'm a professional, licensed cosmetologist so of course i disinfect with quats or 99% alcohol (just a spray or two) after cleaning it, but that process takes so long especially the drying time (over night upside down with a brush guard) but i think this thing would be perfect for in between clients and at home especially. And its only like 60 bucks! so getting it.
Maybe try and put a handheld brush cleaner in the bottom of the bowl? I wonder if that'd work?
FYI, you don't want to submerge the ferrule of the brush, because it can dissolve the glue holding the bristles in and cause them to fall out.  Same goes for regular paint brushes.
Where can you get this?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!1
I think you should see if it works on paint brushes. :) for art people everywhere lol
Or clean your brushes more often?
So, basically, a motorized drill and a fish bowl? Nice.
Hey just a heads up guys, went to the website and your only option to buy this product is to get the shipping by February 10th, other shipping for 2 for 3 days are sold out so your only option is that and its around $72 dollars. So guys might want to hold until they have the 2 for 3 days shipping returns.
Bunny can you try the goat case ?!? The one that supposedly can stick to any surface. I think it'd be cool to see you try it.

You both terrify me and capture my attention what the hell is this
Love that sweater

So sassy! 😀 Wanna try this SO bad!
Your eyes are gorgeous ❤️
I❤️ your video ❤️💓💞💕💝💘💙💚💛💜💗💖
so do the likes help you increase revenue/attract advertisers or something?
Your eyes are so beautiful and ilove your videos!!❤❤
OMG I GO TO DR. BRONER TOO... idk how to spell anymore
Today is my birthday can I get 100 likes please!!!!!!!!!
I hate that bunny has to beg for likes now. YouTube! Fix y'all self!
I believe it's pronounced fer - like pharaoh and then ule - null, so pharull
I don't wanna see your videos! I don't know why YouTube keeps on recommending me your videos. I'm not even subscribed to your channel.
For everyone who says the soapy residue and everything first her murad makes sure you don't break out and the soapy residue comes out when you spin it and most propel use rubbing alcohol either way
Yes to the silisponge! I've been wondering if you were going to test it out!
I use baby oil to clean mine. It's really easy to get the residue out
I want to know how it gets the soap out of the bristles. I get it spins it, but that wouldnt remove the soap. I wouldnt be able to handle that. I would have to rinse it...
her blonde and black hair is life
Love Bunny but the begging for likes is starting to bug me 😖

Have a Happy New Years everyone!!!
U can use dawn soap and olive oil
I feel like they need to be rinsed after the soap....I know its supposed to spin off the soap......but ugh!  no....there needs to be a rinse cycle.
Heyy swamp fam where the notification squad if u is here   Love u bunny ❤️❤️
Hi random person scrolling through the comments hope you have a wonderful day
And people tell me MY eyes are bright blue😂
Well, I guess it's good that the soap amount required is minuscule.
Do your makeup w it!!! Yess
Its sad that even youtuber like Bunny is begging for likes now.
90% alcohol actually sets the bacteria/germs try using 70% alcohol instead if u want to disinfect 😁✌🏽️
I think, for how much water you should put in the fish bowl, you don't want to fill it past the ferrell of the brush.
L..M..A..O.. it'll be a cold day in hell before something like this goes anywhere near my expensive Japanese brushes.
video on you doing your make up with a spinning brush! hahaha 😂
HI BUNNY PLZ PIN MY COMMENT I Don't WANNA GET LOST
Yes, please do the Sillisponge!
happy New year
At 67k likes! C'mon guys!! Let's do it!!
yay! I was really hoping you would try this!
I just woke up
her reaction to the first spinning brush.....lolololololol
Can you please do another WHATS IN MY BAG!?!?
Do this again
Basic dish soap would do the trick, too.
New Challenge:  Put make-up on with the StylePro Brush Spinner!  XD
Artists need that!! 🎨
I don't wear makeup and therefore don't own any makeup brushes, but... I really want this?!?! xD I wonder how well it would work for paint brushes though! If it would work at all.
The price is hefty, I can easily see the wholesale people doing ripofffs for under half price soon. My secondary concern is - does it run on batteries? If it was rechargable then I could see the price being worth it, but having to spend on batteries is ridic.
I am really curious does the Harry Potter makeup brushes fit in it?
Been dying to know if this works. Mommy is so lazy about washing her brushes!!!
loving the hair
yes!
You could put alcohol in the container afterwards and do the same spiny thing to dry them.
the changes in the light distract me a lot
wow such a simple technology but works wonders
I might buy this after I move, I'm in the process of moving, we'll packing now.
I love her eyes😍
I just noticed how blue her eyes are.I wish I had blue eyes!😀
yes!
What part of her house does she film in? Btw I love your does this thing really work videos!!💜🖤
Please yes
you know what, I hate ppl who hate her!! I love her. she is always so funny and sweet
I think you should!
Oh man, I wanted this but other reviews say it is not good. :(
I think you should!
Oh dear, now bunny is doing the Like begging thing.
Ah I'm so glad you tested this out! The guy that made this won the UK apprentice a few years back and all his stuff is so well made and is so well researched and always thinks so hard to help people out with his inventions :') Also so glad to see this works! I've toyed with buying it for months b/c I'm so lazy with cleaning brushes so thank you for this!!
Your face at 3:59- awesome!   Singing "Using things for what they're not supposed to be used for!". Loved it!  Thank you for making such educational and hilarious videos.  ❤
I would want to rise my brushes not have  the soapy water dries on them
Finally got swamp queen makup palet I LOVE IT 😍 (sorry if something is spelled wrong😂😂)
I would totally buy this for my sister. She's going to be a makeup artist. She is graduating next week from her aesthetician school.
wow that very good
Lmfao I did have a small heart attack when she threw out the box
I wish i could clean my beauty blender with this.. i hate cleaning it so much
I think you should do does this thing really work on the silly sponge.. pleas 😁😁😁❤💕💖💗💙💚💛💜💝
Am I the only weirdo that uses shampoo and conditioner on their brushes? Lol
So cool! Great video! :)
Is there no rinsing in just water?  I rinse my brushes after cleaning them.
I'm new here.  1:29 seconds in - does she stop shouting or start to talk normally?
what made bunny choose YouTube?
Just put the rubbing alcohol in the bowl...
wow im totally gonna buy one :)
yes bunny 👍👍🍍🙏🙏🙏✌✌💖💞💕
I would just buy this for the drying cuz thats cool. And maybe for the puffy brushes
can you please to more toy does this thing tealy work
i always say "DOES THIS THIIING REALLY WORK?!?!?!" with you :)
Nearly had a panic attack when you said you were going to use the water again😆
OK, I'm curious if this leaves any soap residue in the brushes, because you don't rinse it at all. I would be curious to see you put one of the brushes in clean water after to see if any suds happen.
get a fish bowl and a electric screwdriver. boom.
Why does need that many views?
It works
plz plz plz plz  do this challenge it is called the $10:00 target challenge  hope u do it buy😄
I use the Sephora Brush Cleanser which works really well 💕
Can you do a does this thing really work on pottery cool
Have you done a video on what your murad regiment is.  If not do you plan on doing one. I use murad as well and love it but would like to see what you use.  Maybe I can change mine up slightly.  😀
Do it!!!
Omg her hair was bothering me soo much😂😫
I could definitely use this as a makeup artist! Need!
OH MY GOD, I fu*king love you Bunny you are so crazy but i love you
try dip and spin in hand sanatizer the spin out to get rid of the germs
it is 100th psat clen but. I have it to you will need disop and I gave mi 20 \10 👑
I love her hair like this anyone else???
heb waterbottle hehe <3
I need a full face challenge using the spindly brush! :D
Love u
Not big on makeup and makeup cleanup but my family LOVES , DOes this thing really work!!!!!
I miss the "sip sip" part :(
Yes, yes I did think the product was in there. 😂😂😂
The ad before this was for the swap queen palette! ♡♡♡
Let me ask you Bunny...do you empty your sink every time you wash your dishes? Of course not...think of it the same way. :) It's so wasteful to keep using your detergent and water after each brush.
lol I just use my drill to spin my brushes😂 it works like a charm
I love your vids however the thing got the whole process of cleaning that brush done in under 30 secs. come on bunny for 30 sec that is really clean
Just so you know, "ferrule" (the metal part of the brush) is actually pronounced "fair-ole" 😊👍🏼 love this video though, been wondering about this product for awhile! 😃😁
7 mil subscribers... I would HOPE 100k likes wouldn't be hard.... just sayin... lol
maybe for the cream makeup a different soap would work something more oil based like is used in eye makeup remover
Does anyone else get ads in the middle of her videos? I enjoy bunny's channel but find myself watching less. This is the only channel I experience this as well
a video of Bunny doing her face makeup with the spinning brush how she said in the beginning, that would be a hysterical and fun video to watch!!!!♡♡
I would wash the brushes normally and then use that system just for drying the brushes
Your hair is blue green black and blonde
IT GOES SO FAST THERES SO MANY THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE WITH THIS LMAO IM CACKLING
Feel kind of weird being a guy watching her videos.
I can't recommend the sephora solid brush cleaner enough. It comes with a pad and it's truly incredible. Nothing has cleaned my brushes that well ever
Yes silispongge
it reminds me of a car wash 😄😄😊 🐊🐊🐊swamp fam!!!
Zmaybe try warm/hot water when cleaning the cream makeup brushes. That may help remove it from the bristles.
I find it a bit odd that they don't have you rinse off the soapy water.
yes
I would definitely use it just to dry my brushes. like, leave the fish bowl empty and spin the brushes in it.
Hope you had a great day too bunny, as always your appreciated!! Thanks for the awesome reviews, happy new year to you and dog man!,,
you are amazing that was the best video your the best
my brother passed away today
and yes
you are amazing that was the best video your the best
Awesome!!! 😜I think that I would get addicted to this! I would be trying to wash EVERYTHING with this!! Even my silverware, maybe even socks too
I feel like it didn't come off the concealer brush more because it's a flatter brush, where as the others were round. It wouldn't have spun quite the same.
yes bunny!!!!🐇
I loveee how the add before the video was an add for bunnies pallet 😍
When you are a violin player and kinda jumped at ferrule bc you actually know what it is
DOING A GIVEAWAY ON MY CHANNEL YALL♡   & I am so scared to use this brush cleanser. lol
Bunny, Seriously I just want to thank You for being so genuinely YOU!! I have had my share of depression and anxiety and I'm going through a lot this year especially! Anyway, whenever I'm down, I just watch You and You really make me laugh so hard and I forget my problems for the moment! You are so very beautiful inside and out & I thank Jesus for You!! Have a awesome New Years Eve & Happy New Year Blue Eyes!! Love Ya from Linthicum Maryland!! ❤
Bunny would you please do a favorite makeup brush video??? I really want to know which ones you use.
I just bought one 😂
Yes you should @grav3yardgirl
i liven in the uk and i have never seen it xxxxxxxxxx
Why can't I be as pretty as Bunni?
Hey bunny idk if you read these but I got your eyeshadow pallet for Christmas
She should count not talk she did it for like double the time
hahahh youre so awesome bunny
when she spun the brush for the first time lmao
Your audio was crazy but otherwise your great as usual
hey bunny, just some tips - 1. the water level diagram is just telling you to fill it up so the bristles aren't completely submerged to the metal part!  2. soapy water that is "dirty" still works.. like when you wash ur dishes by hand, you get a soapy sponge, use it on multiple dishes, and then rinse all of them. soap/agitation is what matters, the dirty water shouldnt hurt (like others have said, it would be then smart to rise ur brush under the sink before the dry cycle)
Pause at 4:10😂 love you bunny🖤
Why asking for likes?
Am I the only one who finds themselves disappointed when I see "dislikes" on Grav3uardgirl's/Bunny's videos? ☹️ I just find her personality so refreshing. My children (boys and girls from 4-14) and I all love to watch her videos.
i would just use this thing to dry my brushes
You guys should try mixing your liquid soap with a little oil, then clean them as usual - I've tried jojoba and grapeseed oil...works really well!
I love your videos a lot but I can't watch 18 minute video i hope you can make your video under 10 minutes.
Way too expensive for me but I would love it to clean my brushes
Don't ask for likes, Pathetic,
This is so awesome... and then you mentioned the price ... woaaaah
Stop asking for likes
"This is insane, it feels dry." 😂
is there a hack for slime
I saw this on Facebook today, and then I got a notification that Bunny uploaded this video🤗🤗
Whyyyyyyyyy is the ad in the middle Of the video?!
I needed this today Bunny thank you for that it's nice to smile and be happy for a short time.
for the time it takes to clean 1 Brush, I would have 5 cleaned
Don't taste that sponge. It sucks and there are many videos on it.
you could make a big cup of water + soap then pour some of that in each time to save on soap
Shaaanxo just put up a video on this an hour before you now I feel like I need to get it
Can we have a segment on your channel where you clean your brushes and just talk to us. It was oddly soothing watching brushes being clean. Lol
Shame that there's not a way to make this work with double sided brushes
she talks a lot
that cool
This is so weird bc shaaanxo did this today and uploaded it too
I hope you are this I LOVE YOU
look up Melissa and Doug paint cups they have a similar rim no spill style but if you use the spinner thing it may be able to use a lot more water than this lets you
But if you think about it, you would probably go through about the same amount of soap and water washing your brushes in the sink the old fashion way. Just a thought (:
In her last vid she said she needed the likes because there's some problem with YouTube does anyone know what it is? Are they only paying her for likes instead of views or something??
when I saw this video she asked for 200k likes so when I went to hit the like button it already had 57k like only, 30 minutes to an hour after posting this vid so I definetly funk we can get to 200k likes
Pity it's a tad out of my price range
STOP. PLEASE STOP ASKING FOR LIKES. It always makes me want to dislike your videos.
does anyone else think the way she said ferrule was weird. its definitely just pronounced feral like a feral (wild) cat lol
This thing is cool!
And in Euros this costs €56 ❤
Yessss please do the Silisponge!
I need this
I'd rinse it in different water
Does Anybody Really Want To Clean There Brushes Like Right Now lol🐊 I don't have this yet but I'm going to get it after watching this, I'm going to clean my brushes now but it won't be as fun as this lol 🐊 I've been here since the beginning ❤
so desperate for likes 🙄🤢
Instead of brushing your brushes through rubbing alcohol, you could spray them.
Way to expensive for me, but good honest review.
Where does she have the room to keep all the products she buys ???!
Okay I've seriously got to ask. Are your eyes SERIOUSLY that blue!? They're flippin' gorgeous!!!
is bunny's black blonde hair come back
Yes yes yes test the sponge!!!'
This would kill the shape of your brushes after some time
I love you bunny
that would be so cool
yes test the make up sponge
You added too much water and soap solution to the bowl
yes yes yes you so need to
no! more water!! yayyyy clean water!
I put in my like for the video, just wanted to say I love this series!
your skin looks fantastic
56,127 likes as of 8:41 p.m. central time.    It surprises you that you got 300K likes?  Buns, you're an extremely likeable young lady with a wicked-sharp sense of humor and a beautiful spirit.  You earned all those likes.  That was a great video and Dogman was hilarious with the hamster beauty blender.  Please consider doing more of those.
This comment is for the folks who asked questions about what seems to be something new with You Tube. On other people sites, they wrote things about how Y T wants longer videos, like ten minutes, instead of only five. One of them called it a new "algorithm." A lot of people are asking for likes and subscribers, and saying it makes a difference for them. There are other changes, too, like commercials in the middle of videos. All this does not bother me, but the You Tubers, I'm sure, don't like added pressure. Who does? This is a business, like any other, and the bottom line (profit) is what matters most to companies.
Test the silisponge!!
Yes, silisponge!!!
If i had that I would probably repeat the process like 4 times.. lol
Someone please tell me is bunny married?
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay do it
I have a suggestion for this product. Do one initial wash in the same water with all the brushes. Dump and refill. Do a second cycle. Dump and refill with water and alcohol, do a third cycle. Still faster than hand washing.
Isn't "Ferrule" Pronounced like "Feral" ?? I always thought it was.
I use the real techniques brush cleanser pallet and I have to use soap for each brush and fresh water each time I WANT THIS!
can you try the simply fit bord
sorry copper
bunny, you give us so much pleasure with your videos, its the least we can do is press that like button
do the coper pot
I recommended this to you on Facebook like two weeks ago and I wanted an honest review, thank you so much for actually listening to your viewers and trying out the products that they want to see instead of just the products that everyone else is. ;) you are awesome.
im the begining i thought that pot was a coffee pot LOL
Hey guys! Any one want to support channels? Check mine out!  Love you Bunny!
The only youtuber who doesn't ask for like now is asking for likes I HATE IT WHEN THEY DO THAT 🙄🙄
I am loving this product!!! Will definitely be looking into this!!!!!
yay u finally did a does this thing really work video I have not seen one for so long and u don't post often anymore
I need that so much
What is that ring that bunny wears on her ring finger? is it like a promise ring?
I LOOOOVE YOUR HAIR BUNNY 💕😙😘
I LOOOOVE YOUR HAIR BUNNY 💕😙😘
I know I'm gonna got attacked for this joke even though it's not really that mean but here goes.....Your a 9/10
I love "Does this thing really work" day.
Is she ingaged
Yes For sure 👌🏽please do that does this thing really work
the normal person would be able to use this and keep the same water for quite a few brushes
this is so satisfieing
It looks like it works, the only concern i have is any soap residue. Yeah it spins the water off but there's no rinse cycle. Perhaps you could spin the brushes in this device in only water? A second "rinse cycle" if you will.
Your video froze on me and you facial expression is hilarious!!
Luv ya!😆
She died her hair back!!!
in a day you got 50K likes!!!!!!
What's up with asking everyone to please click the like  videos lately?
Surely you have to rinse it??
Bunny you're like the best YouTuber l know *hugs*
could you do a few brushes in each dose of water, then use some warm clean water to rinse?
bunny do a mukbang please !!!
I'd probably rinse them after washing them....great little device!
Do u know who's beautiful?       no it's not u it's me
Guys. It's $50. My dreams are ruined
How even does she have 7 million followers and don't even get 300k likes
Silisponge!!!! YES PLEASE!!!!
Pls do fidget cube
♪ Using things for what their not supposed to be used for!♫ 😂😂😂
I love it
It would be so cool to see your make up collection! !! or how you store it  xx
is she on crack? she looks insane...
Even if you dump the water each time, you're still saving a lot of water.
Is your black fading?.... it looks like a dark darkkkk blue and it really looks amazing😍😍😍😍
wait what is going on with youtube that we need to get likes for?
What does the like button do? Help get views?
Omg, I hate cleaning my brushes so much that I would pay someone to do it. I am gonna get this for sure.
a 30 second ad bunny, really?
you talk so wierd
I logged in just to like cause I love your videos and fully support you
fer-rull :) ha
I need this!
I would so like this product but went online to see the cost I thought it was a little high. It was over $60 US dollars and £49.99
please do the silaspounge i really want to see how it works. love your videos lots of love
you can put ur brush on the end of a drill and the same thing would happen hehe
Thanks for the review Bunny! I've been wanting to know if that thing really works! Now I need yi figure out if I want to buy it. You're the best Bunny! Keep doing what you do!
This didn't show up in my sub box like um exxxccccuuuuusssse me
Silly sponge review yes!
THERE IS NO PHALANGE
I wish you would have taken the freshly cleaned brushes and ran it with the spinner through clear, no suds water, to see if it left anything in the water. :)
I need this in my life.  I usually use Dial or Purpose, but I bet Dawn would work, too.  Murad might get a little pricey?
I usually clean my brushes with a dot of extra virgin olive oil, and a bit of non-concentrated Dawn dish soap. It sounds odd but it moisturizes the brush and helps extract all the makeup that's stuck deep into the brush.
I miss the "does this thing really work" vids! Liked :)
You got a new subscriber, your videos are awesome!💜
Changing out the water for every brush is super wasteful and not to mention how much time would that take out of your day? like a lot. This device however looks like an amazing brush dryer. You could wash your brushes as usual and use it to dry your brushes. Washing brushes is one thing but it takes me like a day to dry them. That device would dry your brushes way quicker.
I so want this now, for all my brushes from face to paint brushes! Thank you Bunny, for showing us DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK!?!!! 😁
Yes you should do does this thing really work its awesome bunny
With the cream makeups, do a prewash with a little dish soap, the wash with the murad.  Also, if you are going to do alcohol, do them in the stylpro as well.
love your hair!! is it green??
What about rinsing them? like isn't there soap in them? just wondering.
Why are ads in the middle of your videos?:/ makes me not want to watch, especially since we have to get through the beginning ad too...
I'm so proud to be apart of the Swamp Family, I love all yall! including Bunny 😉🐰
How did you purchase? I'm in Texas as well but it kept saying there's no shipping available for us. How did you get around that?
U should dye ur hair green for the swamp family
how can “thumbs up“ help any video out? what's the point?
I feel like I'd only use that to dry my brushes.
I liked this video
hey bunny I always liked this but I feel like if you wet the brush after using this  it would be soapy bc you don't put it in clean water after. I don't know I'm probably wrong but that makes me not want to buy this. If anyone has this can you try it and tell me I really want to know thank you.
i love u so much I love you to meet me someday
I only like videos I genuinely enjoy, I don't like them because I am pressured by the YouTuber I am watching
How are you eyes so blue 😳
Love you
Bunny I got ur makeup pallet for Christmas it's amazing I love it 😍
No offense I love your channel but I think you should dye your hair again xx
already a quarter of the way there in likes, i love Bunny so much lol
wash a few in the soap, then change water for rinsing and add a teaspoon of rubbing alcohol for extra sanitation. this will save on soap and ur gonna rinse anyway.
can you do a D.I.Y slime in 5ways
I can't seem to order it from your link I'm from Oklahoma
I miss this..I really love does this thing really work..😊
I am lovin your jumper/sweater soo much!!! I must have it......... please tell me I can get it online, or somewhere in Australia. Or will someone get it for me and post to me.... please please please please please, pretty please with 🍒 on top ❤️❤️❤️
"Collars" -grav3yardgirl Best praise 2016
Guessing you can't use this with artis brushes x
What if you found a way to stick makeup brushes on a drill and put it in a bowl
Even tho you change water everytime I still feel like you save more water with the device because when you clean the brushes in the sink you have the water rinning for a pretty long time wasting lots of water 👍
Yes
Does the like button really work? Oh my gosh loved that!
Do a makeup haul/tutorial/does this thing really work with Physicians Formula makeup! I checked and very few have done it as successfully as I know you would!!! Cheap makeup that's good for the skin. Cmon BUNNY! Live dangerously!!
Why not fill the same bowl with alcohol and do the same exact thing after washing them?
Finally!!!! More makeup "does this thing really work!" You give the best reviews!
Yes test the SILISPONGE
Bunny "They probably say, that your never suppose to just....."  then proceeds to do it. lol
snapchat swamp family 🤗🤗
you freak out way to much
do I spy blue in Bunny's hair?
lol yes it scared me so bad when she threw the box XD
I don't know why, but when you started spinning the ecotools brush and said that you probably shouldn't.....I laughed so hard! is that weird? I love you, Bunny!
Personally I would rinse my brushes after doing this because I feel like there would be soap in my brushes. Just me? Also so happy that you posted this video!!!♥️
BUNNY just to let you know, I had to push the LIKE, button like 3 Times! I HOPE it worked in the end. Just thought I will give you a heads up.  I would love to see you do the silicone sponge, your always so funny and happy, as well as being honest I love you, and I'm PROUD to be apart of the SWAP FAMILY!!
I dont know. Seems like alot of work just to clean one brush!
I swear grav3yardgirl did a similar product a year or so ago?
I have this! I love it! I wash them preliminary by hand (especially the cream) then I kinda "rinse"  and dry them in this!
I like thisssssss ❤️ want it !!
"let me buff your face in a non-calming way ~~"
i luv ur hair BTW
♥️
This thing DOES really work!!! 😜
first
So is anyone else thinking fishbowl vase and a drill? Also I add a little alcohol to the soapy water, wash all through it once then rinse each with clean alcohol and water.
Hi Bunny 😍im so impressed by the brush Washing apparatus and even though I only own about 4 ecotools and 4 wet and wilds 😆It would be nice to own one of those babies to wash them☺️
I'm gonna be honest... normally I find this kind of stuff gimmicky but this looks pretty decent. It takes me so long to clean my brushes and my back ends up hurting really bad and I make a mess. This may save me a lot of time! I may get one. Anyone else here in the comments have one and like it?
You have the most gorgeous eyes ever 😻😻😻
bet my ecotools domed bronzing brush wouldn't fit in that
Liked ❤ and yes I wouls like to see bunni
This looks like fun!  I dislike cleaning my brushes soooo much.
47k!!
The blue is sooooooo 👌🏻
I need to get that haha
Why dont you rinse the soap out???
i have always loved ur hair!!!
Omg I'm so happy you did this I want to buy it but I'm questionable
Bunny I want to send you mail but not sure where to send it
This is the first product that I actually want to buy that you've tried. It looks like it works so well.
This is perfect for art brushes also :) for acrylics or oils. Found a other use for it, i might buy one.
*QUESTION!* This might sound dumb, but what should I wash my brushes with?? I usually just use hand soap, but for some reason I feel like that's bad for the brushes/my skin.  Are there any CHEAP makeup washes that I should try? And are there any alternatives (like hand soap) that I can use instead of makeup washes? Thanks❤️
Hi Bunny,   what does that mean: " it helped the video out!"  I love to support you, but I would also like to understand why it is so important to like your vids  now.
you can diy with a power drill and a fishbowl lol
Happy New Year Bunny.
🐠🐟🐠🐟
🐟
Its my birthday can I get 10 likes?
i love your earring
I WANT ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
http://cashforinvite.com/account.php
whoever made this is a genius
Make a video of you applying your make up with that spinny thing!!!
What if she puts the alcohol into the water and soap mixture. That way it will be sterile and clean.
This gave me a new use for my dremel!!!  Now all I need is the silicone sleeves.
Snapchat fam?
What a great way to spend my Birthday.. Watching a Bunny Video!  :)
what's going on with the likes? is there a problem worth the videos? why do the videos need to be liked so much?
I hate when you tubers beg for likes, either earn the like or shut up. Disliked.
👯
So many big words😫😂
"DOES THE LIKE BUTTON REALLY WORK?!?!" 😂😂😂😂
The only part of this that I'd actually pay for is the drying aspect of it. The bowl is yes, a bit easier to use, but it's a bowl, and you could use any bowl. I don't like how dirty the water gets, and the way that they don't get rinsed through, and soap isn't good to stay on your brushes. I also feel that in the spinning part then it could get all in the glue.
Hey Bunny, can you test out the spay on nails to see if they will work? Bye you're my favorite YouTube EVER!! Love you and your vids
You know what I would do , with soap water I will clean all brushes first even its little dirty and then second time rinse with plain water all brushes one by one and I will check if water is still getting colors may be rinse 3 time . This will clean brushes thoroughly and no need to change water for every brush.
oooo I wanna use it for other reasons hehehe just kidding
Love the hair
Her hair is Beautiful B E A U T I F U L
I don't understand why Bunny has to ask for likes. She has over 7 million subscribers. Don't those people get notifications? I certainly do.
not all germs are bad for you. Your body is crawling with germs inside and out no matter how much you clean and wash. the other thing is, the more you disinfect and clean the less tolerance you will have to germs and bacteria. you will probably find that your skin will get even more sensitive or you might get infections and colds more often 😊
I think Bunny forgets she has 7 million subscribers😂 she's so down to earth and normal bless her. She's literally just how she was when she started the channel which you don't see very often and it really makes me happy that she isn't fake but just herself and she's literally the coolest person alive for that.
Bunny never change! You always bring a smile to my face. From a crazy UK subscriber 🌈🌈🌈
And you're not supposed to rinse the brush?  I always do.
I love bunny but this is a gimmick... just wash your brushes by hand. I know we want to to go faster and get our brushes "really clean". We can just do that with our hands. 😕
I'm loving your hair!
I love you bunny🐰🐰
should i do a DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK for the SILLISPONGE?  let me know!  (ง ° ͜ ʖ °)ง  thank you so much for being here today SWAMP FAMILY!  ♥  i love you & i hope you're having an AWESOME DAY!
Dogman's voiceover was epic. I liked it before you asked lol.
You should try to wash them after and see if anything else comes out
Sterilization is created by using extreme measures of heat, kills all bacteria including spores, using an alcohol would be considered disinfecting which kills most bacteria excluding spores.
this would be amazing just to dry them??? if u washed them yrself and dried them w this it would b so easy
I love you and the videos you make😍
repeat out-loud: "Red leather, yellow leather, red leather, yellow leather..."
Hi bunny I've been watching you for about 4 years now and you are such an inspiration I love you so so much 200 likes people! I'm an Irish swamp family member! Plz reply u would make the end of my 2016
I don't even wear makeup but I still enjoy watching her test products designed for makeup stuff.
Love you 👍
The black is back in here!!
Anyone want to subscribe to this account? I can subscribe back from my two channels, and like a lot of your videos! Please!
I hate when youtubers ask for likes. if I don't like the video or don't want to watch it more than once I won't like it
or you could just clean your brushes the regular way and use the spinny thing for drying
you could wash it the way you like and then just use that tool to dry them with.
I wonder if a blender rigged up would work?! jk!
I need this! 😩
I like the way Shannon did it with the solid cleaner and then rinsed it with this
No rinse?
bunny, the end......you are priceless
Omg her reactions😂😍😍💖💖😂😂
Does anyone know what earring she is wearing??? It looks hella cool 💕
Do you change your soap and water between every dish while washing dishes? Think about it. The germaphobe in you may be coming out just a bit. :) And they do say in their promo video that if you are using this on a liquid makeups they have a special soap for it. So it might be good to look up what is in that special soap and get something like it.
SWAMP FAMILY MEMVERS UNITE ALL HIT DAH LIKE BUTTON AND YEAH IT WORKS I TESTED IT!
you are so funny
Safety pins are for pussies.
I'm gonna attach mine to the end of my husbands drill pwahahaha
The black in her hair looks blue 0.o
I really miss SWAMP FAMILY MAIL! It''s probably super difficult because of how many swamp family members there are now, but I miss it! All videos are always entertaining, but I just thought I'd throw that out there lol. HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE! 💞
It actually does come with a soap which is more like an oil it's amazing
Thank you for your review your personality is amazing ❤️️
Can you do the random makeup challenge?
who else remembers Bunny's ghost videos?
Thanks Bunny !
do it. 💜💙💜💚💚💚💚😎🐒
She reminds me of the baby sitter in the incredibles... she's just so enthusiastic about everything it's great
Bunny, make a poll for the silisponge! Love from Canada! 🐊❤🇨🇦
Yes, please do a video of the silisponge.
TBH my mom needs that because she like never cleans her brushes
she did this before
If you had two of these types of bowls you could you the first for getting if the major diet then the second for the deeper clean before doing spin drying could save on water and soap before having to dump xxx
I wasn't prepared for this intro 😂😂😂
bunny please do the silisponge ilysm
I want this so bad. I never want anything but this omg
I have the same brush
That's a neat product you tested today! I might have to get it...And yes, test out the silisponge please! I wanna know how YOU react to it.
Wow, I was all for this till you said the price! lol
bunny do the silisponge !!!
Does anyone know why Bunny started asking for likes? I don't mind at all, I'm just just wondering cus I know before she didn't and now she does. I feel like I missed something.
Bunny I really enjoy your videos but using bottled water is so wasteful!! Do you recycle the bottle after? When I was in Dallas there was no recycling to be found. Don't even get me started in your double cupped Starbucks. Please be an example and stop with the waste!    No hate 💚
hey bunny I recommend Johnsons baby shampoo to clean your brushes it's really gentle and inexpensive... I've used it for years maybe you could give it a try? xx
Your hair looks blueish! It looks cool!
I love you bunny! You're so amazing!!
Idk bunny, this is making me sad, ads right in the middle of videos, begging for likes.  You were never worried about views and likes until just recently and it makes me so sad to think you're worried more about numbers than people
your face when you turn on that thing hahahaha so much for this Life LMAO you really make my day with your videos  ❤❤❤
please try out A'PIEU products
Can you please do a video where you try to apply you makeup with the spinning thing😹💗
She died her hair again?!!
what is she talking about when she mentioned the stuff w/ youtube and her channel?
It works 100% better with hot water. Cold water doesn't remove liquid foundation ;)
Never use alcohol
Can you please go subscribe to Temmehtale 030.She is my best friend and will appreciate it sooooooo much!
bunny you should try doing the bottle flip challenge with dogman please :)
Stop begging for likes.
I wonder if you used warm water if that would  work better with the cream product
you should try baby foot
I want one 😄
Your eyes are so beautiful
I hate to be that person, but I guess being a swamp family member for the last 4.5 years, I miss the old videos. I get it, people grow and move on to new things which is totally fine. Maybe I grew out of the bunny era. Makes me a little sad :/ :(
My goal is to reach 200 subs my new year! Hope I can get there! LOVE YOU BUNNY AND EVERYTHING YOU DO ❤️❤️
it's over 250,000 already lol.
I want one 😄
these vids are way too long
just use an actual fish bowl and a power drill 😂
Stylpro do have their own soap for the machine - it's called stylpro makeup brush cleanser! This is in the UK though!
yeah i think i want that bunny I'm going to find that it beats pouring dish washing liquid on the tips of the brushes and me pinching it trying to get it clean and trying not to pull the brush hair's out and messing up I'm going to see if i can get one of those
"I'm like a super excessive type of super extra kinda person" girl me too.
You are so insperationable to me I love your videos i just love your videos❤️❤️
Stop talking so much and just do the video
I'm excited to hear what you have to say on the Silisponge!
I would like ash them quickly in the sink like I usually do which I do ver fast then use this to dry them so I can use them straight away
this is fabolous!
$80.00 Holy Cow!!!
I honestly feel like you probably use less water changing it each time than you would just washing them in the sink.
Oh Bunny! We, fans, will like everything you post! We love you so much and hope you have a good Happy New Year celebration! And Happy New Year to the whole Swamp Fam! Aye! <3
I know its not a as seen on tv product, but Bunny should use the hot glue and clip board method of cleaning brushes and do it for a does this thing really work.  Like if you agree.
I miss these so much
Please Do More Videos With Dog Man
Please Do More Videos With Dog Man
snap squad <3
I watched this while washing my makeup brushes!
yayyy plz try silisponge
Ohhh! This was invented by a guy that won The Apprentice in the UK
200,000 likes for double the income
I don't even wear makeup but I kinda wanna get that and a brush just to play with the spinny water in the bowl....
Maybe you could try using warm water for cream products
cool bun's i like i just put a lil liquid dish washing soap on the ends of the brushes and rinse with warm water but I'm going to see if i can get that thanks
Wait why is bunny asking for likes when Pewdiepie found out that dislikes are the new thing.
This product seems pretty neat, but I think it would be much better if it mentioned a rinsing step. All you really need to do is add a little bit of water into a glass cup and just wash all the brushes regularly in the soapy water, and then rinse and dry them in the clean glass of water. And maybe just adding a small squirt of soap on each brush opposed to adding a teaspoon to the water each time, it might save you on the soap. As long as they get an extra rinse, I don't think using the water for multiple brushes would really effect the cleaning process. Unless the water gets like a ton of product in it, then yeah change that shiz.
yess do the silisponge please ivs been waiting for you to try it and i didnt even knownyou ordered it!!!
I am a pretty big fan of yours. I was actually feeling really sad before I watched this and u made me smile.
LOVE YOU!!!!!
🖐hi bunny HAPPY NEW YEARS!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🍷🍸🎊🍹🎉🍸To u and dog man 🍸🎉🍹🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉
A drill and some type of silicon attachment 😱 diy?
I had cc on on accident and instead of bunny, it said funny 😂
I love your chanel bunny
Why is every YouTuber asking for likes? Is it to show up on the trending page?
i rly like her top. it seems to comfy 😍
"Did you think the product was in there? SURPRISE! IT'S NOT!" LMAO!! 😂😂😂😂
If anyone was wondering the product it 49.99£ (pounds U.K.) so $61.74 (dollars U.S.).😊
But maybe u can just use spining thingy to just make the brushes dry? After u have washed them.
If you are worried about wasting cleaner you should wash all the brushes once just to get the majority of the gunk out and then change the water and do them all a second time to get that final cleanse without the gunky water. The bottom of the fish bowl should have a little silicone nubbly thing to clean the brushes better.
I use baby Johnson shampoo makes my brushes clean and smell like baby too :-) also bc I sometimes wash my face w/it in the shower and I have never broke out from it so yay
Finally!! The main reason i've subscribe to your channel was this type of videos. Keep doing more
i am def going to get that cleaning tub for sure!!
rain drop
Silisponge review!!!
FIRST  LOL  LOVE IT
Try with hot water it cleans better
That looks like a vibrator XD
Yayyyy it's posted on my birthday 😂😂
Liked!!
try Dawn dishwashing soap for creams, then rinse with your desired soap...gotta release the oils in the makeup
Sending you lots of love bunny! You're the best, it's my birthday (but I hate my birthday) and watching you makes it all the better ❤️
Do a house tour before you move!!
Do a house tour!!!!!
I love her so
I would definitely have to dump the water each time. Looks like an excellent product to get. So there is no actual rinsing?
I have not watched bunny in like a year
Cool!
Who else thinks she should curl her hair with makeup brushes
i ordered the silisponge as well and test it for myself. a vid review on that would be very helpful
They still need to be rinsed!!!!!!
that device remunds me of a car wash
Hi Bunny. I wash my brushes in Dial Antibacterial hand soap. Oddly, my Dermatologist suggested it for my face when I break out so I figure it's fine for brushes.
its only been three hours see the amount of comments she has
oh bunny i am with you on the "washing one brush and getting clean water" i dont want to take a bath in my tub water again so i wouldnt want my makeup brush to have a bath in another one's dirty water, so i am with you 100%!!
Bunny you have millions of followers why is it hard to believe that you could get 200K likes? People are just lazy and forget. It's Farryl rhyming with Daryl.
I am opposite and would use that water for all my brushes.
yes i would love you to do the test
small youtuber here.. subscribe if u like asmr..
can you do the straightner brush next
I didn't work for me because these videos sucks
I have a question how many tattoos do you have
under $80 yeah no 😣
THE LAST DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK OF THE YEAR😭😭😭😭🙄
It's so satisfying
Hey bunny
She probably said it, but how much does this retail for??
Cool
If anyone deserves likes it's totally you Bunny!!
I might have to try this
can you do a     new shoe coletion vidio
Maybe the product works better for fluffier brushes? The brush with the concealer was not as flexible as the others, I think that's the reason it isn't 100% clean
Her eyes so blue...
Feel like still need to rise the brushes again once in clean water.
I don't know if this is weird to ask😂 but could you please make a video of you cleaning some more brushes with this device I really loved this video for some reason😂
YOU SHOULD DO THE FLIPPING FANTASTIC!!! Plzzzzzz
Help her hit 8 million subscribers! like just subscribe!
It was invented by an Apprentice UK winner, who also gave us the Stylfile :)
Y'all!! Subscribe To BUNNY!! LIKE SERIOUSLY!! I've been subscribed for 5 years and never have regretted it! Hit thqt subscribe button NOW!
Why the unskippable ad halfway through???
Life hack. Electric Screw driver, and baby shampoo.
that is so cool :) :) :) :) :)
Try the device with a brush cleaner mat (like that one from Sigma that you need to stick into a sink). And try this methode with brushes that you used with creamy products. Believe me, your brushes will be clean AF!
When it went on for the first time it looked like a chimney sweep brush from Mary Poppins.
This is super cool, my only thing is that it leaves dried soap on your brush. Like you go straight from a soapy brush to drying it. I think it should be dipped in clean water before drying.
I hope that this YouTube shutting down channels thing stops! I love you bunny and I will never stop
omg I love that sweater!
Fabulous gadget - could use it on my paintbrushes too!! X
bunny how much is shipping
Love this channel!
I would want 2 of those bowls so I could do a rinse too tho.
i love you
It's like a super intesnse salad spinner!
Your black hair is growing back
I love her new hair
Do you dump out your dishwater after washing each dish? It's the same concept. 😊
Ew  I would want to repeat with plain water to rinse and then put in a little alcohol and run it a third time to sanitize and remove the creams. so it would be a three part cleaning, but it always is no matter what I use. Still pretty cool!
Does it work for paint brushes? Oil and acrylic paint?
I can't stop looking at it but she only have one earring lol
Where did she say that she is moving?
it's been 2 hours bow after uploading and there is 36k likes, I'm pretty sure you'll get over 100k likes!😊😘😍😂
Do the ads really need to interrupt the video? 😑
I think I would clean my brushes with soap and a wash mat outside of the device, then use the device for rinse and dry.
I agree with another subscriber, since your moving and it won't matter, it's be awesome to do some home clips before your totally packed up. And post it once you've reached your new abode :) you have a unique sense of style I'm sure your house is awesome
Maybe you should rinse the brushes
Maybe the cream brush didn't work because it was a flat brush. Try a dense round brush with cream. They spread different when spinning
This is so cool! I want to get it. Also yes please on the silasponge!
soooooooooo...... basically its a dremel drill handle with a rubber attachment, and a dollar tree fishy bowl. xD that would be so easy to make at home. xD never thought of that before. neat idea tho if you have the spare change
Is it okay if I clean my brushes with baby shampoo, cause that's what I use...
I'd get this just to dry my brushes
Happy New Year Bunny ! Thank you for all of the video's in 2016 ! I am excited to see what 2017 brings. I hope your move goes smoothly.
wondering if i can test this out with the electric drill hahaha
Shaaanxo just uploaded a video like this! Weird 🤔
I'm here 2 hours after post, and you're over 200k already lol
Your energy is amazing :)
I'd buy that for paint brushes
Thanks for vid.
So this might be a little excessive but what is stopping her, or anyonr with enough hindsight, from buying another one and cleaning the brushing again but rather the soap-and-water but rubbing alcohol instead? You probably would not use as much but it would clean, santize, and dry your brushes
I found this so satisfying
Do you think that it would work on paint brushes
you are hilarious!!!!!!!  I love it when you sling you hair.
Her and Dogman always wore the same ring which I assumed were couples rings...but now she's wearing a second ring with it...so did they get married? 💕
It take two time with cream I have it and I use it to clean my cream brushes you don't need to do change the water I change mine every two time when I use it I use warm water when I use it for cream it works better
yes do silisponge... trust YOUR opinion!!
Low key triggered when the ad came on right before you were going to spin it 😂😂
woo!!! I liked it :)
Top Tip. Use a couple of pumps of antibacterial hand wash instead of soap solution if you want/need to change the bowl after every brush.  Won't do much to conserve water I'm afraid, but will save a fortune from using expensive brush cleaning solutions?
I want to see you review it. lots of luv from Las Cruces NM to you bunny!!!
Bunny is the perfect medicine if you have depression.
you should try to do it with warm water.. maybe it'll work better :)
They look very clean
I use baby shampoo. I might try wiping them afterwards with the alcohol. Sounds like it could kill more acne germs.
#8Million Do a blooper video
Omg I need this in my life!!!!
WE appreciate YOU miss Bunny! like! like! like!
so long since you have done one of these :D
ummmmm.... yes do the sponge. I almost ordered it yesterday.
Okay so is it just me or is her hair like a greenish grey color on some parts? Not a huge fan of the way Guy did her hair. (I love the black and blonde, just not the way Guy did it)
Maybe using warm or hot water for the cream brushes would work better
if bunny is moving, is she staying in texas ????!!!
You could always just to dry it if u don't want to use it to wash it
Haha cool I'd love to have this for my body powder brushes
does she know like button doesnt do anything??
I 💚 U BUNNY!!!!!!!🐊🐊🐊🐊
grav3yardgirl Try the Spin Spa massage brush.
can i get one like for no reason? :D
Love the colors of your hair. Very swampy. 💚💚💚🐊🐊🐊
I love you bunny
LETS GET ME TO 500 LIKES MY MOM SAID SHE WILL GET ME 10,000 ROBLUX IF 1000 250,000 PLEASE LIKE
We're can I get that soap because I also have some really sensitive skin so I can clean my brushes to
@grav3yardgirl as far as fullness goes, I think they just don't want you to submerge the ferrule of the brush. Its not good to soak that part...
Yes please test the silosponge
Hi Bunny. Thanks for all your videos. You always put a smile on my face!😄
You should use 70% isopropyl alcohol to sterilize your brushes. It won't evaporate as quickly as 90% therefore will have a longer contact time and more of a chance of getting things bacteria free! :)
I've had such a bad night and I can't sleep but watching your video put a smile on my face thankyou Bunny ❤️
Oh my gosh yes, I sooo want to see someone use this to apply makeup!!!! DO IT!!!!!!
could you try the silicon sponge please
Yes!!Test the sponge!
I enjoy bunnie looks like my auntie lol super funny been watching since her paranormal days
the metal part is pharaoh
I have just started trying to make Youtube videos and can only hope that someday I am as relaxed in front of the camera as bunny 🙊 She's amazing! :)
"ferrule" is pronounced more like "feral"
Power drill, Mason jar, Hot water and face soap works just as well. :) Unless your brush handle doesn't fit in the drill.
Yes, Bunny! Yes, I have been waiting for you to test the selicon spondge!!! can't wait!
she starts trying the product at 3:30
Looks like she has a thin diamond band on with her promise ring . Anyone see it ? She looks so happy too!
I wish I had her eyes cause I have brown eyes and I don't think mine are pretty
maybe next time just fill the bowl with clean water and just use like a bar soap on the side and then only dumped the brushes in to actually get them wet and then dry and maybe that wouldn't make the water as dirty I don't know just trying to help
Ah bunny *sigh* I love you
U should try the fidget square or the lipstick that's clear with a flower in the center that changes color once it touches you're lips
I'm wondering if this would work on kabuki brushes with very short handles, would it reach down? Does anybody know?
omg where can I buy this!!!???
You are very welcome
PLEASE DO TEST THE SPONGE ON CAMERA
try swirling into a soap bar before entering into the jar maybe
I need this! Washing my brushes is such a chore and this looks so fun and I can't believe it dries so quick! 😱
Had never heard of this item. Looks very cool and works!
PLEASE COME TO THE UK PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
I would change the water every time.  seems if you don't you wouldn't get the next one clean.
Happy new yr BUNNY
Not that I care, but why is Bunny pushing so hard for likes. I don't ever remember her doing that before. Just curious. 😀
wow wheni started watching the video it had 28k likes and when i finished watching it has 31k!!😱
You should do a review on foreo luna Bunny!
Can you do another "can it curl" video?? Please!! : )
I love your VIDEOS!!!! I hope you read this comment and by the way I LIKED!!!!
I have those brushes I love them
I hope you can get that many likes Bunny. That would be amazing
I think if you can just use this to dry your brushes if you really want to clean the creams and stuff on... plus it could save on soap and water and still cut down on the drying time
Really really wanted to see this video
What if you "pre-cleaned" the cream makeup and then used the machine for a second clean?
She really needs to start doing more does this thing really work videos cause they are awesome
you should try ULTA beauty make up plus they give free b-day gifts
You should definitely make a dttrw with the silisponge!
I saw this product on Wayne goss over a year ago and was so sad it wasn't available in the us. I didint even finish watching your video before I ordered this. Sooo excited. Not able to get it till February 10th but that's ok; well worth the wait! Yay!!
I think maybe instead of using different water every time, give it a rinse in running water after spinning it in the soapy water and then spin it dry :)
she makes me think of Star Butterfly
Her hair dye is spreading
Started dying at 4:00 😂😂
you are the best
😻
Wolfieraps?? 😂😭😭
Murad makes brush cleaner? I didn't know that.
haha i have literally just came from  watching the same product trial from @shaaanxo... nice to get 2 different opinions tho❤
Subscribe for a sub
omgggg you should do video by trying to put make up on like that!!!!!!
I love this!  I wish it wasn't so expensive though! 😟
hi Bunny
I feel like you definitely don't need to use that much soap each time.
I love you Bunny ☺
She should collaborate with Social Repose
Plz respond @ bunny
You should try the unicorn makeup brushes
@ BUNNY Can u do another does this thing really work but with food?
"I'm just pouring the murad into the teaspoon and then dumping it into the fish bowl"
Will u do the brush straightener please xx
FERRULE...NOT  "FUR-RULL", IT'S MORE LIKE "FAIR-RULE". HOPE THAT HELPS
YOU SAVE WAYYYYY MORE WATER USING THE STYLE PRO. SO MUCH WATER IS SAVED.  IMAGINE HOW MUCH WATER YOU SAVE BY NOT USING THE FAUCET..
I have the same brush and don't know how to use it!! can someone hellllppppp???
It's my Birthday today !!!!!!!!!!
I got one for Christmas, and I like this WAY better than the Lilumia. Hands down.
Have this. Love this. Recommend this.
Bunny I LOVE that sweater where is it from?
Luv u . You're my idol 💋 😘 xx xoxo
<3 bunny!!
#BEST not worst BEST video ever
you could also use some really cheap shampoo as the soap
wow i need this in my life. happy new year everyone xxx
Cool sweater bunny!!
Clicked on the link and in the picture showing the before and after it said using a special type of soap only
I relate to Bunny on so many levels
Fair ul
it really stressed me out how bunny did everything for longer than it said
Try a does this thing really work on a crayola meltdown artset
Lol I had the same thought about using it to apply foundation 😂
During a group presentation in my BIO 102 class I had to say the data results and I said milliliters like ten times when i was supposed to say millimeters. One of my partners finally corrected me when I was finished talking so I feel your embarrassment bunny 🙃
Y was she not in YouTube rewind??
i wish she tried this device to wash a flat top kabouki brush cuz it's more dense and stiff :(
I love you so much 😂 you're so exciteable
I received one for Christmas. I found bigger brushes took a few more seconds to dry. No biggie. I use Dr Bronner Liquid Soap for the majority of my brushes. You can buy a Stylepro cleaner for things like gel eyeliner and cream products which you can use in place of liquid soap and you use a capful at a time. I'm a believer and very pleasantly surprised and pleased that it works so well and dry.
Love love love you bunny! Give an alligator its wings girl! 🐊💚
"we will see if the like button REALLY WORKS" lol i dont know why i found that so funny
happy new year you guys! what are your goals for 2017?😀
i would like it for drying but not for cleaning
I would feel like the brushes didn't get rinsed enough after being swirled in the soapy water. There is no rinse cycle...which I feel is necessary.
New Years resolution: if you subscribe to Bunny and watch her video(s), like them! No matter what. The Swamp Family needs to work together to fight Big Brother YouTube! :) :)
Why is her hair green?
Any small youtubers wants be friends?💕
Happy New Year, Bunny!!🎉
I'm going to cosmetology school and I need this in my life
yes I want you to do the silicone brush silicone and thing or whatever you call it whatever you called it yes I do want you to do it love you bunny 👋
Does anyone know if this works with the real techniques powder brush? Or any of their face brushes? Its just i imagine the shape of the handle would be a bit odd for the thing that holds them
I love it 😍  This would be perfect for me bc I'm so lazy
I'm sure this is still less water than keeping the Tao running while you wash the brushes for every brush
Bunny talked so fast at one point i had to make sure my speed was at normal.
When she started counting to ten it was already ten seconds
make sure that the brush is dry before you touch it because if you don't wait fot the brush handle to be dry then you might get dirty soapy water on you and when you touched your face or ear or whatever you call it you could have got the dirty soapy water on you but i think that you'll be alright you're not going to get ill from touching your face when you have dirty soapy water on your hands i think that you'll be fine
I'm so so glad you did this review! I have been looking at this thingy forever and wondering if it was worth it! 💕
I KNOW YOUR FANS LOVE YOU FOR HAVING SUBSCRIBED BUT THEY SHOULD LIKE ALSO.I MEAN IT DOESN'T COST THEM ANYTHING IF EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE YOUR VIDEOS,ALL YOUR VIDEOS WOULD HAVE ...MORE THAN HUNDRED THOUSAND LIKES...I ALWAYS LIKE YOUR VIDEOS:)
could just use less soap if you're gonna dump it between individual brushes, too
Can I have a shoutout please bunny
well, you don't change the water for every dish you wash? and we eat off of those...
I am noticing the influence of poppy here ! am I right ? AM I? love u bunny <3
tried to order this product and the website says it doesnt ship to the usa :(
The cream makeup did not fully come off because of your brand of soap and not the product
BUNNY I WONDER WHY THE OTHER LAST VIDEOS DIDN'T GET THAT MUCH LIKES??...I MEAN IT'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH HARD...ONLY CLICK LIKE!?I ALWAYS LIKE YOUR VIDEOS EVEN YOUR OLD ONES....
I love it how most of your videos are at least 10 mins 💚 Cant get enough of the sassiness 💁🏻💁🏼
Omg that's it I'm sold!!! This in now on my wishlist lol
just a little ps, usually you can figure out if a brush is stained by using 99% alcohol on a cloth or paper towel and running the brush over the alcohol area. If something comes out it usually needs more cleaning (which you can just do with the alcohol, and if nothing comes off then it's just stained!
no.
I LITERALLY DIED when u said "does the like button really work?"
been using an electric drill to do this for months
That definitely works
if I had this device Id DEFINITELY repeat these steps with just water to rinse. Looks like a cool thing to own though.
Do one with the silsponge
I like your vids bunny #swampfamily
test sila!!!!!
fishbowls.
I always thought it wouldn't work
love you hair ot looks so pretty😍
🐇🐰🐇🐰🐇
Watching This High Is Honestly The Best Thing Ever 😫😂😂😂
SNAP SQAUDDDD🐊🐊❤️❗️
Silisponge YES PLEASE!!!! 😀
you are AMAZING Bunny. you make me laugh EVERY video of yours and you brighten up my day and I just love watching you💖💗💖💗💖💗
Babe where did you get this shirt I'm in love
Yes! Silisponge. I need YOUR review of it!!
I love your videos 😂
I was in board until she said it was around $80. Then I was like, "I wonder if I could attach my brushes to my husband's electric drill?!?" This video made me a creative genius!!!
This has me so shook
Shaaanxo did the same video she tried a bar brush soap and it works a bit better
Can the next does this thing really work, how about YouRubes algarithm bc i dont think it is!!
bunny is awesome
Can you just make an entire video cleaning all your brushes it looks so cool
Can u try the As Seen On TV smart swab and naked nails
MY GOD I CLICKED ON THIS VIDEO WITH MY VOLUME TURNED UP FULLY AND I THINK I'M NOW DEAF !
Bunny, I think only YOU have to change the water every time. I usually wash my brushes in a bowl or cup to save water and I only change the water after 4-5 eye brushes or 1-2 large face brushes.
The It Cosmetics brush cleanser cleans my brushes really well in seconds and is way cheaper for all those on a budget.
funny you said that because we actually learn to search anything we want on the internet :'D at least in France at my school when we where like 8 lmao
maybe if you use warmer water with the cream concealer brush?
You should try putting your makeup on with this tool... hahaha stylpro makeup challenge anyone?
What about using hot water?
It looks like it will work rather well! And FUN!! I can see my face, clothes and walls splattered by the water... Hm. New way to add accent to your walls😜🐊🐊🐊
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Pronounce+ferrule
well these things look nice and cool but i still wash my brushes manually.#basicbitch :)
I keep thinking you could do this with like, a low-powered drill, fish bowl, and a wide funnel.
When did she change her hair????
Bunny🐇 Can you please try the "dermacol" makeup next?
oh bunny, ferrule is pronounced Fair-el. Kinda like barrel.
I love your videos bunny! you inspired me to start my own channel
isnt it pronounced ferrel like barrel?
I just saw shaaanxo video on this and then came here to watch this haha
I get the like thing but stop begging.   and trying to act like your old self when you were more into the channel.   its kinda pathetic .     hope you tube gets it together so all this can stop, not trying to be mean.
Omg i love Bunny's hair, its like Grey blue❤️😂
❤❤❤
Can you review the peach makeup pallet
Your dirty little brush friends... lol
The like button does, in fact, work.
I'm so sad about how her hair turned out.
what if you made a big mixture of soap and water in a jug and just kept pouring it in inbetween
Your hair is like a green-blue black and I love it!!!
I wonder where Bunny keeps her Plumbus? Everyone has one.
I want to see you try out the  silasponge.
I don't understand how she expects them to be completely clean by just using face wash in there 😒
Hey I started a makeup page on instagram  to fulfill my life goal! I would love if you could follow and hopefully share to spread my work! @pangelinan_glam
Really like the vids. you should try and put make up on with that thing.
Silisponge!! Do it! :)  Also, anyone looking for a channel that is all over the place... check me out! Hahaha :)  Help out a fellow Swamp Family Member! Xo 🐊
Do you feel like the spinning compromised the shape of your bristles? Or was it easily manipulated back into the right shape? Love you Bunny!
I personally didn't like this device x
I am Acually gonna buy this it will save soo much time
For rubbing alcohol I recommend using 70%. For the next does this thing really work, can you do recolor? I saw it on a TV commercial. I would change the water too after each brush.
So the first time I saw Bunny's new hair colour I was taken aback! It's so beautiful on her and green hair is my favourite and she's my favourite and I want her to put more green. It's just so good.
ur great. the end.
Let's play a game take a TEQUILA SHOT everytime bunny says "this" 😂 much love ❤️
Saw this yesterday in my local Boots (UK Drugstore) thought it looked interesting too! Looks like it actually works lol
Why people disliking Bunnys Videos?? #swampfamily
lol it's a bad type of asmr 😂😂😂 sily sponge would be great 👍
My hillbilly side is telling me make some kind of DIY with a drill but I'm refraining.
*whispers* bunny you could have asked Marzia to order it then send it to you since she's in the U.K.
Rain drop
Lets make a story, comment two words below: Today I....
use warmer water for the dirtier brushes and maybe a small drop of dawn dish soap. Breaks the oils down.
Yes! Pls test it
Why do the "that many likes" thing? It's like youtubers don't want to know if their subscribers liked the video anymore, they just care about the views... too bad, Bunny.
yes I would love you to test out the silicone makeup sponge
maybe for the brushes you use cream makeup on you can rub a bit of soap on it with your fingers first and really use the bowl as of a rinse and dry
im gonna have to buy this, plus it'll literally take like a week since i live in the UK lol  (EDIT: nevermind that costs fifty pounds....uuuGH)
wait...she dyed her hair blue???!!
I think the problem was the fact that the concealer brush is flat. I use a stippling brush for my creams. I feel like that would be better than the flat. maybe. I wish she did that as well as powder!
we are all your friends here!!!!
Lmfao your facial expressions get me every time! 😂
Why is she begging for likes now? Did I miss something?
us English people have the different ways to measure things you've got millilitres, litres, centimetres, metres, inches, feet and stone there are probably more but I can not think, it is 10:34 in England.
For the amount of water needed in the bowl, I'd use a sharpie marker on the outside to make a line for that purpose.  It does look pretty cool!
She reminds me of phoebe from friends Anyone else?
My cousin got this for Christmas she loves it xxx
it looks like a coffee pot 😅
The look on your face when you first turned it on with the brush!! 😂😂😂 thanks for making me laugh xx happy new year!
just use baby soap/shampoo its a dollar at the dollar store
Yes please the sili-sponge ❤️
The way my mind is working, I'd say to clean the brushes without dumping them in the water, as stated, and to use the device to dry them.
To late
Whose gonna be cheap and go to the garage and rig a drill to clean their brushes now?🙋🏼🙋🏼🙋🏼
finally ordered your pallette and lippies
😂😂
hey bunny!
I would have a cup of clean water on the side to spin the brushes in for a few seconds after the soap water. Then dry them off for 10 sec after. I think you could use the same soap water for a lot more brushes without leaving any dirt behind on the brushes :) Sry for bad english xD
Try not to get water on the electric thing just incase it isn't waterproof and don't get water on the electric thing just incase it's not waterproof
try to do youre makeup  with it !!!
You're Rockin that sassy pony tail today!
I would totally dump the liquid out after each brush I can't get down with putting a dirty brush in dirty liquid and have it come out clean..... nope. that's a cool device for sure!!!
"The farrule" lolll that's great
I use a 50/50 ratio of dish soap and hair conditioner to clean my brushes!
3:58 lmaaaoooooo fav !!!
Is she married
Haven't watch bunny in a while because of school but omg I've missed you so much 😂💖💖💖💖
lol does the like button really work ?      oh bunny you had me cracking up xxxxx😂
Is your black hair fading to blue? It looks blue on my iPad!
There goes the metal part
Gurl stahp asking for likes please
You look very pretty today I love your hairstyles everything day
Maybe if you don't us as much soap (like half as much) each time if you change the water between brushes , then you wouldn't be wasting any brush cleaner
The next one should be orbes
I love bunnys reaction
please react to this video and make a video about you reacting: "gif tutorial on a mac" like if you know what this is
My fav kind of video who agrees ?
This is pretty amazing^_^ I want to get into make up just to use this lol
yes test the silisponge!!!!
Aren't they still soapy?? They didn't get a rinse. My husband made me one of these with a drill, why didn't I market that?!
AAAAHHH!! Its my birthday!!
Dude....if it damages it if you use it for longer than ten seconds...theyre gonna get damaged pretty quick because....if you clean them end only once a week...thats 40sec a month....blah blAh...noxema deep pore cleanser cleans my brushes and it's the only thing that gets my black beauty blender...perfectly black and clean again. and then dip every thing in the alcohol
whats up with always begging for likes these days?
Wait there is black in her hair again - did I miss something???
Please don't beg for likes hun bun, they don't do anything and it makes me want to stop watching even though I've watched you for 3+ years
I want one!  :)
The thing I noticed with this device though is that the brushes aren't getting thoroughly rinsed out this way.. They're going from soapy to dry.
Do the sili sponge!
get a 2nd one and spin your brushes in rubbing alcohol to make them sanitary like you mentioned.
I tried buying it but the site says there's no shipping method for my area. Is it not available everywhere in the US?
I would want to rinse them in clean water before spinning
I'm trying to start out my channel! Check it out if you want to!
Silisponge!!!
i do enjoy does this thing really work videoes....hugs bunny
No they dont teach U.S. kids milliliters. I'm surprised i can even spell it lol.
You are supposed to take it out of the bowl with water in it and spin in the air so the brush can dry
I do not like this gal
Didn't Shannon upload a video on this today also ?
What was that yellow brush called?
Welcome to my world! Most products that I would love to try don't ship outside of the US... 😢
What a nifty product. Certainly looks worth the investment. Thanks again Bunny *hugs*
can you do a draw my life video?!?! like this if you agree!
Omg go for it guuuurrrrrl!!! 😆
I take it you're not using your Lilumia brushes cleaning robot anymore ? mine is almost dead.
🖌 love it! you're awesome! 🖌
yes bunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnY WE LOVE U
you could cut a circle out of the mat thing use to clean brushes then put it at the bottom of the "fish​ bowl" for extra cleaning
This is awesome
I like the way Bunny's voice gets all cute when she says 'I love you guys so so much' :D Adorable
Am I weird?  I'm a guy that doesn't know anything about, nor care about, makeup, but I find Bunny so entertaining to watch.
yes, you should test out the silysponge
I love your sweater. 😍
neeeeeed
PLEASE TRY THE SILISPONGE
Hope you have a great new year! Love you ❤️
LOL at 3:59. She's hilarious
You could use a medicine kids spoon to measure the soap if you wanted to be exact :)
Omg! Considering this! It's my birthday today! Follow and like my pictures on Instagram as my present! @Jocee.bosss
I like the video before I even see it because I know I'm going to love it
🐰🐇
who else thought they were hip to the makeup world until she said "FERRULE" and i was like huhh?
I think I wouldn't leave the soap on it. I would want to do a rinse spin, just like laundry!
I have OCD, so I totally feel you on the dirty soapy water.
It's funny cuz in my subscriptions this video shows up right above Shaaanxo's video of this exact same product
That brush is from eco tools I have that one to ❤️
did bunny dye her hair?
Hey guys- just started a new makeup channel, check it out! :)
yes please and thank you
Roses are red My ass is heaven Because it got kicked By the legend27
it's pronounced feral like a feral cat not ferool.
am I the only one who does her intro with her?
OKAY THIS IS SO COOL, i saw this on Facebook recently and I'm so happy you did this because i was so curious omg
Now I want that brush cleaner
"so you clip this thing into the end of this thing"  literally me explaining everything
if you don't like how it cleans you can always use the spinner to dry the bigger brushes after you clean them regularly so they dry fast
1000
It's pronounced Ferrell as in Will Ferrell.
Thats cool, i need one of those 😄
Ur hair looks so pretty
your hair looks green *^*
YAS!! Test out the sili-sponge! pleaaassee 😃
4:08!!!,,,so stinking hilarious! !!,,bunny,,you made me dribble a lil !!:)))) great review!
Wait shouldn't today be first impression friday
Your eyes are more blue than the sea Your eyes are brighter than my future
I'm from the UK 😊😊🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
I looove your rings! sooo purrrty!!!!
Yassss do the sila sponge review. Your so gorgeous, love ya.💖
Why is she asking for likes all of a sudden?
I hit the like button each and every time I watch your video's regardless! Bunny your my favorite YouTuber EVER!!
bruh it's like $62.98 USD. well gotta start next year's Christmas list. 😂
I would just use a pump of hand soap, very inexpensive and works great for me, I also usually massage some coconut oil in them to keep the softness
$63 US.....I think I'll pass on it!
Thumbs up for bunny
Bunny test out the silisponge or cilispongeb he how ever u type it or spell it I don't know how😂🤣!
Awesome product, not exactly necessary but really fun 😀
It's my birthday!  Attention me!!
In America they don't use ml for ex where I live (Canada) we use km and in America u guys use miles
You couldn't use Artis brushes with this :/
I'm kinda early.....
Loved this! I'm considering buying this product.
Any small you tubers want to support each other? Please sub to me and reply to this and I'll sub back! Bunny is such an inspiration and I'm so happy to be a swamp family member 💕🐊 have a wonderful day everyone! Keep your head up
Don't ask for likes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG I LOVE YOU!
:O i made it! early!!
I'm going to try that with my drill and a bowl.
after seeing this product, I'm going to try....my electric drill!
Is it just me or does her hair look a little green? I'm kind of into it hahahaha
just wondering: are you guys more likely to thumbs up a video when the youtuber tells you to?
Favorite YouTuber of all time!!!
Shouldnt you use warm water?... just a suggestion
Sup
first
"SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON"
I was hoping she would review this
Bunny spun the brush above the first water for 20 seconds 😂😂😂😂
nice device 😊 thanks bunny
I think I might have made a diy for this device .. you can use the hand mixer tbh .. just stick the brushes to the mixing stuff and turn it on and i think that will work ^^
Bunnies eyes are so beautiful 😍
tbh I don't like it when youtubers ask for likes...
I'm a huge fan
Shannon and bunny both reviewed this. which one to watch first
Theres an as seen on tv website!!! http://www.asseenontv.com/
I'd love to see you try the silisponge!
How much is this??
ok, so now I need this because this looks amazing! 😍
Yes silisponge!!!!!!
omg I want to see a video where you only clean brushes😍
Bunny, I have been watching your videos for 4 years now and you have helped me be inspired to do so many diy projects and it has really helped me through some hard times .I love your videos and I hope to keep watching for a long time . #sippysippy # swampfamily
Wouldn't you have to rinse off the soap in plain water though? 🚰🛁
I'm the 900th comment
but then it seems your not taking out the soap and they dry still with some soap on.... i dont like that...
#savebunny
instead of a get ready with me can you do a wash brushes with me. WBWM.
I love this series sm!!

Why does she need likes?

can someone explain what is wrong with the liking system

Best review yet 🙌
"You get this thing and this thing and you stick this thing into this thing" -bunny 2016. Had me laughing so hard
When she first spins the brush ... Her face .. 😫😂😂😂😂
892 nd
looks awesome honestly.  but very pricey.
Does any one else see that Bunny`s hair is green?

would love to see your review of the silisponge!
I think im early but im not sooooo sure
Love you!
Bunny, I LOVE!!! your hair xxx
I like the color of your hair. Great information on that video!
i loved this video! you made me laugh all the time. i don't know if i can by the stylepro in France cause it's a great idea to clean my brush
this is not just for Bunny, but for all YouTube's: if I Dont like your videos, its because I enjoyed them so much and was so anxious to watch more that I forgot. so plz Dont take it personal
Id like to see the silisponge video. i see this and i just think hhmm wonder if i could rig up my dremel to do that??
yay I'm kinda early!! But not really. 🙂 Btw I love your videos!!
Love you do so much
Ooh i kinda wanna buy this now i saw it in boots!
Asking for likes OMG why
the TONE of your VOICE is all OVER the PLACE
I wonder if you use hot water it would be better.
Go UK!!
You learn the 5ml=one tsp conversion really quick when you have kids.
I don't even wear makeup... why am I watching this?
The reason that there's no line is because every brush is different. You don't want to get anywhere towards where the bristles go into the brush wet because it'll loosen them and you'll ruin your brushes as the strands will fall out.
I'm sorry, I really like these "does this thing really work" - videos, but am I the only who instantly hits the dislike button, when someone is begging for likes? This is just pathetic. You don't need that, Bunny.
I get to finally go out on a date with my husband. and I can't wait! and I'm wearing TARTE!!!! :-) LippyLippy
FAV SERIES
Specifical😂😂
I love you bunny💖
I want the old bunny back like if you agree
The first video I watch from graveyard girl channel was the bacon bowl video 🥓🥓
bunny I love you, you where the first person I ever subscribed to and that was 1year ago. I love your personality, so spunky and fun and up beat. I really hope you see this comment because whenever I watch you, it brings a smile to my face. hopefully the swamp family can make it to 200k. I know we can do it. I live you so so so so  so much. ❤
Finally ordered one of bunny's lippies from tarte!! I'm so freakin excited!!
while i like the idea...you could do the same thing with a cup and a drill...
When that brush started spinning 😂😂
Every time she says "does this thing really work?!" She gets more intense shes gonna explode some day
Haii all!🤗
I feel like I would use less water even dumping it out every time and I would wash my brushes more often like I need to. Soooo glad you did this video 😍 PLEASE test the silisponge 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
They probably didn't make a fill line because every brush is different lengths and They probably just want you to fill according to your brush size.
yes
i would love a demo on the silisponge, me and my roommate have both been interested in that and i've seen a lot of mixed review about it. i'd love your take!
Yes,I would like to see it in action.
I love your blue eyes soooooo much💙
Please help Bunny get 200,000 likes on this video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm getting this lol it is very fun to watch it 😂😂 Happy early New Years have a nice dayy!!!!!
Hi! Love yourself because your worth it!
Can you please do more fan mail videos
please test it - I trust your reviews and would love to see how you like it
MORE MYSTERY UNBOXINGS PLEASE!!!! Do a Doctor Who series Bunny!!!!
who else came from SC
why not just tape ur brush handle on the electronic drill and get a cup of soapy water instead of spending over $20
If you use rubbing alcohol to clean it what you do is put the rubbing alcohol into the thing and do the normal steps again
saw this in Boots (like CVS or Wallgreens) in the UK yesterday on sale and was really tempted but wasnt sure if it was gimike. now i see it works so im really tempted
Take a microbio course, I hate how people are irrationally scared of "germs". There's trillions in and on your body gurl. Also there probably is antimicrobial properties in the soap so reusing it isn't going to "spread germs".
I feel like it would take way too long to wash my brushes with this. Especially since I tend to do a bunch at a time and I have a ton of brushes. I'll stick to my Sigma glove.
Striving for proper pronunciation. https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=ferrule
Yes, please the sili-sponge! Can't wait.
I want thissss
Since when did bunny turn into Wolfe raps  😒
subscribe to my channel please when I get to 200 subscribers I'm going to shave my eyebrows off and put it on my channel

4:14 I love u bunny 🐰😂
i got a 3 minute ad that i couldnt skip right when she was about to spin the brush 😐
4:07 I think this just made my week hahaha
Hey random person scrolling through the comments! I hope you have a great holiday!🙂 From a smaller YouTuber who's dream is to hit 2k subs🙏🏻
This is sooooo satisfying. Please clean all your brushes on camera 😂
Having trouble with the website when I tried to order.  I selected USA but keeps reverting back to the U.K. page when I hit the checkout button.  Is anyone else having the same problem?
I NEED THIS THING
hi🙌🙌🙌🙌😺😺😺😝😝😝🤓🤓
I'm kinda early
do your makeup with it spinning
GUYS. Likes do nothing.
pls I would love to see you test the weird sponge.     Im am from Mexico and I am 13 years old ;)
sorry for the shameless self promo but would you mind subbing to my channel pls? small youtubers let me know when you sub, so I can sub back. Let's grow together. Thank you❤️ I haven't posted any actual videos yet but I hope to very soon
Hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas 🎄🐊🐊❤️ n hope everyone will have a special new year 🎉🎉🎉
baby shampoo works really well and is super cheap and gentle on brushes!
I am loving the blue hair so much!! 💖
I'm giving her a like just for the neck on her jumper. Looks comfy.
Love those little clips at the end😂❤️
omg do the sponge! i trust your reviews more than others!
Silasponge time!
I thought It was a bong on the thumbnail lmao
Please do the review! I haven't watched any of the reviews yet either.
safety pins on your ears for anti-trump??
I thinks it's YouTube that takes the like away, cuz I've been liking many videos and when I go back its gone
oooooooo I saw @FabulousHannah test this over the summer and I wanted it so bad but womp womp, I couldn't have it here in the states.  I was so excited to see you testing it today!
hey, what is going on did bunny's black strands come back?  where have i been??
Do makeup brush cleaner things work on paint brushes? (Also am I the only one who said "Does this thing really work?!" when bunny said it?)
this was published 40 mins ago and it already has 9000 likes. To swap family go go go!
Omg bunny your eyes are so pretty they look fake but I know they are not.
Bunny is so American. Same tho
shaaanxo literally just did the same video today and the exact same thing
who else thinks bunny is rlly pretty in this? 😘 hi from England x
Hi! have a great day!
Oh man :-( I really wanted this until you said it was $80. Thats way too much.. sad now. Great video!!
2,000 likes in 10 min wow
rubbing alcohol is terrible for your brushes it strips the hairs just like the hair on your head so be cautious about that
Am I early yes I am yayayayayay and I need to make a joke but I can't think oh wait. What did the fish say to his son? What? You are ohFISHally my son. I probs spelt stuff wrong sorry,
You are so close to 8 MILLION Bunny! So happy and proud of you ❤❤
do you think this would work with the Harry Potter makeup brushes?
Holy crap her hair is turning blue
Good review. Too bad the product is so pricy. Would like to see the review if the new makeup sponge. Thanks!
Loving how your uploading so much💕💕💕😩😩😩
I would use baby shampoo
I need this thing in my life. It would make cleaning my brushes SO much easier and faster.
I would rinse them out..
what was her last "does this thing really work" ???
lol
Does her hair look blueish to anyone else or am I just crazy
I love her
HI
try the silisponge
❤️
it's been up 39 mins.     yeyv
DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK ⁉️
Why is her hair greeny blue?
Baby shampoo works great for makeup brushes
just watched shaaanxo do this an hour ago. I know how this product works and all but I'm gonna watch it again because I love bunny! x
#notificationsquad push through ❤😂
hey bunny i love u
"Let me buff your face" Bahaha 😂❤❤❤
Am I early
Thank you so much for doing this!! I've been wondering if this worked! Bunny for the win whenever we need her!
That looks awesome
Oh my Jeebus.. first 'does this thing really work?' that I NEED to purchase immediately.. love you bunny!!!! ❤🐰xxx
Like= crush kisses you Reply= one year of good luck Subscribe= trump dies or clinton
I just saw this on fb today and was hoping you would do this :)
To the 47 dislikes...  why
has anyone else tried to purchase this device and it would let you chose a shipping method?
I think you can save time by preparing before a bottle of water&soap and refille the Bowl from there yeah
dont you guys like rinse the brushes with clear water after washing it with soapy water?
192,000 likes to go! Come on Swamp Family ❤
If only I could find silicone attachments like that for my power drill...
I really like ur vídeos but u talk soooooo much
Ima teach you how to trick people     Read more
Ok, I am really confused, where does Bunny film, she said she has a sink right next to her so is she in a bathroom? (not judging)
Love you so much Bunny💕💕💕
Also this video was SO satisfying when all the dirt just disappeared
challenge accepted....on the likes I mean. Uhh yea. cool! #swampfam 👽🐊🌵⚓
I love bunny sooooooooo much
Did it not leave soap residue on the brushes because you don't rinse them?
Do dat silisponge gurl
early squad 💪🙋🙋🙋
Wait, you don't rinse the dirty water off the brush before drying it?
Bunny, will you make a tea vlog about your goals for 2017? I love your long unedited tea vlogs, it makes me feel like i'm having a sip with a firend ^^
Your hair is really pretty straight
I think for brushes with cream residue on them, you can once mix some type of oil (pure olive, coconut, makeup remover etc.) with the soap and water you already used for another brush, then wash it again normally with new soap and water. Or you can use dishwashing liquid if your skin isn't sensitive.
I'm going to try with my hand mixer first, before I spend $63 on this. Maybe I can do two at a time. #unitasker
yaaaaassssssss I am early
I want one!!! shaanxo just reviewed it too, and liked it...haven't finished watching yours, but i hope you like it too haha
surely this can't be good for your brushes
I love when you add the clips at the end! It's my fave
It's about the dislikes
Thumbs up for Bunny!
I'm early
Have you ever been trolled     Read more
maybe warm water would work on the concealer brush?
Almost 7.9 million swamp family members yas!! 🙌🏼🐊😍
this seriously made my day better.thanks bunny
that could be a vibrator... if you're desperate enough
You could also try to use the spinny thing with the bumpy mat
I love Bunny but honestly getting a lil tired of her vids. 😕
yes... test the sponge please :-)
You are so gorgeous girl <3 our goal was to reach 3k subscribers by New years but i dont think we will make it, thank you for being so inspirational <3
i always use baby shampoo to clean my brushes 😁
earliest I've been! whooo! Love you Bunny! You're so inspiring ❤❤❤
Bunny you dont need to sterilise everything, its very unhealthy. You have an immune system. Its kinda nutty.
Hi...
Ferrule is actually pronounced like "feral" :)
I would still have to rinse the soap off
Where did u buy it
When was she doing that shoe haul? Im still waitin
Get bunny to 200k likes!!!!!
So, what about rinsing the soap out? Does the spinning take care of that? I think I'm ordering one of these!
This whole thing about giving likes is getting on my nerves dude. 👎🏼👎🏻👎🏼
Why don't I like after the video is over? That way Its my honest opinion and not just, "lets see how many likes we can get?"
The video starts at 2:22. You're welcome! 😌
early yassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss bunny i came from nickdominates stream for you
Does anybody know how much this cost please ?
Hey Bunny, I LOVE YOUR Channel And THANK GOODNESS THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE LIKE Me... SERIOUSLY ✨❤✨ YES, PLEASE DO A Video Using The Silicon Sponge? Applicator... I REALLY WANT YOUR Opinion ✨❤✨ You DEFINITELY WILL Go OVER 200,000 LOVES!!!!!!! ✨❤✨
omg the earliest I've been !! Swamp Fam where you at?💚🐊
Guys lets get Bunny to 100k like before 4:00 western/ 6:00 eastern
Yess I would love for you to test out the silisponge!
Early af
Amazing
I love yoi.. but plz stop begging for likes lol
sup
Why does bunny need likes? I didn't hear what happened.
I love you so much bunny 🐰 SWAMP FAMILY🐊
30 minutes late squad?!???!!
They don't have a fill line because you are supposed to add the water so it goes halfway up the brush you are cleaning so you don't get the shaft of the brush wet since it is hard to dry and causes the bristles to fall out if you do.
MAKE BUNNY SEE THIS BEFORE SHE MOVES!!! Please do a house tour! I have a pretty good idea of what it might be like?! I wanna know for sure before you move!!!                        I HAVE ALLWAYS WANTED TO KNOWWW!!
Ok this is the fist product that I am actually buying after your recommendation
I've been using mine wrong the whole time
I'm early yasss
Love you Bunny!! 😍😍
Absolutely, yes! Please please please do the silisponge. I watched Jeffree Star's review but I feel like yours would be so much more interesting to watch
Please try to apply your makeup with that, that would be the best video ever!!!! PLEASE BUNNY PLEASE
yes please review the sponge!!!
i wuv u bunny
In early yay  well kind of early
I probably use way more water and soap to wash my brushes without using that thing.
Polluting the planet with bottled water.. SHAME SHAME SHAME Bunny
I love the whirlpool that is created when brush is spun over the water.....it looks beautiful.
I just love your facial expressions and funny noises. Cracks me up every time! 😂😂
we get it, you're early oml
I feel like this device would be really easy to DIY with an electric drill lol
this used to be my fav series but now all you do is beauty stuff :(
18:25
I'm kinda early.. Love you bunny^^♥
can you try The Vanity Planet facial pore cleanser
I think I tagged you on istagram for this product! So glad you are trying it!
I wonder if you added a teeny bit of alcohol to the wash water with the cream brushes
shanon just posted a video about this product!!
did she cut her hair
Thanks Bunny! I saw this product over the summer as well but I was sketchy about. You made me a believer. Thanks for all the help this year and I can't wait to see what you do in the New Year to come. Happy New Year Bunny & Dogman!
Personally I would do all the brushed using the same water,  then get new clean water and soap and do it again. Then I might do a third round with just plain water to rinse the soap out.
Yup buying this ASAP
Bunny, will you please film a house tour of your home and your NEW home?!?!  Pllleeaaassseee with sugar on top. 💚💜
Any likes you need Ms.Bunny! Just ask!! We do it because we ❤ your  channel AND...We ❤ you and  dog-man!!
Omg this looks so good! I might order one 😂
I was just thinking yesterday how I wanted Bunny to try this!!!
You could do the exact same thing with a drill or electric screwdriver. Its the same way people clean paint brushes, nothing innovative really
lets get to 200,000 likes for her guys!!!!!!! We can do it!!!!!!
I'm so early YASSSSSS 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Right on!
her hair looks a tad green
very specifical ! xD haha
👻snapchat squad
At 8:33 it looks like coffee
Dang bunny this came out 24 minutes ago and you already have 6000 likes
The bag in the background is so pretty!
Love you Bunny....what about using the soap on first run then for second cleaning just plain water? 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
I really need to clean my brushes...
wow 24 minutes later wow
FISHBOWL🐠🐟🐡🐬🐳💧💦
I really want one of these now it looks like a much more fun way to clean them, and after some of the makeup looks I have done on here it would be a helpful thing to own.
hola
Wow that black due faded really bad, makes her hair look green
Its already at 5k likes!
14,00 VIEWS AND 17 DISLIKES ALREADY
176th comment yaaaas I'm so happy because I also got the swamp queen palette for Christmas! I love you so much bunny even though you probably won't see this I have only been watching you for about 2 years but I love you byeeeeee!!!!!!!❤️
Pause at 4:00 ROFLLLOL
this is such an incredible product! definitely buying this!❤️
i want this thing for paintbrushes. i wonder if it'd work
Sameee
I was laughing just a lil bit when you were like sounding out mL (sorry if that is a mean)
Bunny, I wonder if this product would work better on creme makeups with the use of warm or hot water to help break up the "grease" of the product.  Just a thought.
Sometimes I watch other YouTubers and I see how successful they are and how (for lack of a better word) extravagant they live and I feel like I will never achieve anything. But then there's Bunny. Bunny is soo beautiful. She's realistic, down to earth, and normal. She makes me feel ok not like a piece of poo . I love Bunny😊😊💗💗
I feel like you could dip your brush into a small amount of soap and then put it into the jar. That way you aren't using so much soap and you can dump it out every time without feeling wasteful. I personally use a very small amount of blue dawn dish soap to wash my brushes for the antibacterial properties, then I follow up with a brush cleaner. My brushes come out cleaner than ever with this method but it is time consuming. I would love to get my hands on one of these brush cleaners.
already watched 29.1k Times, wow
I love you bunny💖💖💖💖💖💖
HERE
I think I need this lol
this looks sooo cool.
Omg I need one!
I missed these. Also I want this cause I'm lazy and this seems to dry fast.
Early squad
dang only 30,660 views. im early
yay early!!
tesco or asda own baby shampoo cleans brushes really well I've found, especially the one that's a knock off of Johnson baby shampoo, and it's about £1.  this looks really good, I think I'm gonna try and get one.
Yes! Please test Molly silisponge!
Hi Bunny! Happy New Year to and yours. I cant wait to see what shenanigans you get up to in 2017!
add me on Snapchat at tiffanybaby97
I wonder if you could use like micellar water?
Wooooot! I'm early!
I am early yay
Does bunny have snapchat
Thanks bunny for posting
you should try that blackhead suction tool thing
i am picturing bunny just giggling and clean all her brushes
Ilysm Bunny!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Ye
So glad you found this. I saw it the other day and thought of you. This is much better than the other gadget you tried.
Swamp fam strong 💚 Definitely do the silicone sponge! Also I feel like I'd only use that to dry my brushes. I'd like to have the security knowing I throughly washed it myself but then have dry brushes super fast
YES SILCISPONGE!
Try cleaning your brushes with the Zote pink laundry bar, it's amazing, everything comes out so clean and for .97 cents it lasts forever!
HAPPY NEW YEAR BUNNY! YOU SEEM SO NICE AND YOUR SOO BEAUTIFUL!❤❤❤
Yessssss
this reminded me of a car wash for makeup brushes
Please please give us your take on the new silicone sponge
Let's be honest... how often do you guys down in the comments clean your brushes? Judgement free zone
Every Friday I love saying the intro this is literally my favorite type of video 😂
love your videos!!
When you had a bad day...
I love you bunny and I love the swap family and I'm happy I gave alligator it's wigs
Boi ads really need better timing
I would want 3 bowls !!!   1 soapy water then 1 for plain water 1 to dry it in an empty bowl.........maybe a 4th for ur alcohol wash......
4k likes In 12 min 😱
Just saw that on shaaanxo's channel and i am curious if it works for bunny too😂 LOVEEEE BUUUNNYYY WHERE IS THE EARLY SQUAD AT
I think you could half the amount of soap and it would do just as well
Yees silisponge please :D
you should do a video of things that you still use from your "does this thing really work" series
I really want one of these.... but, I think I would have to RINSE them in just water after the wash.....
Notification squaaad!! Yaas!
it's been too long since she uploaded her last does this thing really work
Wow!!!! 😻
she posted it 26 minutes  I'M EARLY THE FIRST TIME  NOBODY CAREEES YAAAAY
You have sink in your room??Girl thats cool!! I love you!!❤❤
Wish I knew about this before Christmas !!
Who else says minamiter instead of milameter
This seemed like a great product til I saw it was £50 😩
i do
I BET 99%OF YOU WON'T READ THIS COMMENT,BUT THE 1% OF YOU THAT READ IT, HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY!
omg!! shaaanxo just posted a review on this!!! you guys are twinning hahaha
now that works!!!😊😀😋
I liked it!!
I've never been this early yaaaaaaas
I♡U
I missed these💔❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i love you!! xxxxxxxxx
Finally another dose this thing really work video
I know no one cares but I got two new kittens!!!
What I do is do a once over wash on all of them with the same liquid and then I change the liquid and do them all again. if I notice the water is getting cloudier than just from soap/it foaming from the spinning I'll change it again. But it's so worth it if you're prone to acne or just clogged pores, irritation etc. I have rosacea and occasional cystic acne outbreaks along with generally just sensitive skin so it's wonderful imo.  I do witch hazel or tea tree instead of alcohol btw, it's still antiseptic but it's way less drying on the brushes.
bunny: I'm gonna do exactly what they suggest! also bunny: *does the steps for much longer than suggested*
Ilysm bunnyy! 4k likes yassss. 💕
the ironic thing is Bunny is the first person I've seen do this successfully.
I'm the 401 comments
I'm feeling this got here after 26 seconds of being uploaded felt like a tru fan 😂
Can't you clean your cream makeup brushes the regular way and then use this just to dry it?
I got this in the mail yesterday 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
i wish she would have tried cheaper brushes thats my main concern honestly i feel like it would cut their lifetime in half honestly and i just have so many cheap brushes that i cant live without and i dont want to shorten their lifespan at all 4 real
love the vlogs from Birmingham uk x
How much is it
Here from snapchat 😍😍😍😍
Notification Squad Where yall at? bunny is my fav YouTuber she is different than other YouTube she very funny and she doesn't have to try
every time I try to like, it unlocked it as soon as I move the page. wtf
never really get the chance to watch your videos on time,  you upload them while I'm at work.  today wasn't busy so 'yay' I'm not too too late!  love you Bunny!
blue dawn and a dash of vinegar and water
I'm happy you made this video I have been wondering about this product but I think sigma shape dry tower would be good after cleaning them. I was worried about my more expensive brushes losing their shape.
** scrolling through YouTube ** sees a new Bunny vid... clicks and likes while the ad is still playing :) Love you Bunny!!!
Can u test the spin scrubber
💕
I'm early yassssss
Is it just me or is Bunny's hair starting to look blue?
earlyyyy

🐊🐊🐊❤️❤️❤️
Shaaanxo uploaded her trying this on her channel today
You are seriously my antidepressant.
ok clearly I missed something what's the deal with likes now? Like no duh, im gonna like bunnys vid but ?? What did I miss
I really feel like the little brush cleaning bowl should have little fishies on it with like makeup brushes in their mouths or something. Misses marketing opportunity .
im so earlyyy lol hii bunny!
YAS. This really is always my favorite day of the week!!!! I love you Bunny <3
if you're reading this, i wish u a HAPPY NEW YEAR! #swampfamily <3
Bunny, I'm no hair artist but I think your black hair is fading to blue and it looks amazing!!!! YOU LOOK SO PRETTY ILY

You are amazing bunny and you always make me laugh. Thank you for making my worst days better when I watch your videos.

U should always use hot water to wash ir brushes, at least very warm, to break up the product
I love you bunny 🐰! Can you do a haul video of affordable makeup products off of the site wish? Would really love to see a video like that!
Or you can just be like me and not clean your brushes

Can the next "does this thing really work" be about my brain? Because I feel like I get more and more stupid everyday 😂
we love you bunny your our favorite youtuber
My swamp queen palette came in the mail this morning and I wept I is so beautiful
Everyone keeps putting wayyy too much water. When you push the bristles into the water to start you should be able to absorb almost all of the water
I always like her videos before I start watching 😂💕
with the way youtube has been lately, liking and watching the entirety of videos from Youtubers you like is So important. I used to click off when the outro started, but now I watch all the way and Always like bunny's videos.
I was waiting for Bunny to try this!!
does anyone else do bunny's intro with her? just me??
a fan....that looked fun for something
If every single person who watches this  liked it. It would get more that 7,000,000 likes
Love your vids so much❤!!
Early ❤️❤️❤️
I'll help u get to 300k
What's going on with the like button? Why does the video need a lot of likes?
Legend says if you're part of the early squad, Bunny will answer 😱
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii panting hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

Legend says if you're this early bunny replies, is this true?
