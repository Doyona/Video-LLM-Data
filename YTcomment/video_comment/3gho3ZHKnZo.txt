I hope you enjoy this crochet hook case. I received word that Ms. Priscilla left this world in Dec 2021. It is a loss to the crochet world. Understandably the site with the written pattern isn't functioning at this time. On my own site I have a link to the web archive that has the written pattern if interested https://naztazia.com/crochet-hook-holder-case/
You made this so easy to follow, thank you!
Hello Donna! Thank you so much for an amazing tutorial. I thought it would be a challenge but it was so fun and easy to make.
Could you tell me how wide and high it is?
Does anyone have the pattern I can get a copy? The website is down and the archive is not complete. Thanks so much. ❤
As a beginner im very confused 😭😭 the video doesn't show you how to crochet the second pocket together. It says repeat row 2 and then row 3 a bunch, but the very first pocket from row 2 was easy because it was clear on how to turn your work and where to stick the needle. Now that there's no outer line i dont know where to stick my needle and idk how my work should be turned, i tried the way it was in row 2 but I can't get the crochet yarn through that way???? Please help 🥺🥺
I found your video very useful. I had more needles and my needles were also having bulky handles. So while making the pockets using double crochet in the back and don’t loops. I did 2 single crochet loops before making the pocket.  I also made 12 pockets
Definitely gonna crochet this! But I think I'm gonna add an extra row of DCs or HECs to the pockets to make them bigger, since I'm making this case for my hooks that have wooden handles
Grazie 😊👋🇮🇹
how do i do the single crochets to connect at the end of round 4? rounds 1-3 are in the way
I’m going to try again haven’t tried this video I have failed several times times here goes nothing 😅😊
I love this pattern, but I have too many hooks!! Can you also make let's say.. pages in the case? sort of speaking? I want to try and make it like a booklet and this pattern has given me ideas to do so!
How much yarn did you use?
Jag vill gärna virka denna men jag skulle behöva göra större fack för nålarna eftersom mina nålar är i olika tjocklek i handtagen. Är det någon som kan hjälpa mig hur jag ska göra?
I need video tutorials in hindi land Igav
Hallo wo finde ich die Deutsche Übersetzung dankeschön
Do u sell ur merchandise?
I love how easy you are to follow❤
I finished making my case. It turned out very well but not as good as yours. Yours looks perfect. Thank you for helping me through this project. ☮️🌎🌲
I went on your website and that is not working! I tried it three times
The website that your giving for the crochet hook case on your website, there is no pattern on the website!
I enjoyed your tutorial. Have been wanting to make this for a long time and finally did. Thank you so much! I find it to be very handy. God bless.
Had real fun putting my loop for the button on the wrong side of the case considering I'm left handed🥲 I wish absolutely anyone would've made note about this; it could've saved me a good chunk of time.
Has anyone made this with 12 hook pockets? I did but couldn't figure out the rows for the cover.
Hello thinks for this pattern very beautiful finition I'm on my May to make it ❤❤❤
Love this video like I love all your videos. Made first one with two colors of Caron simply soft.i used variegated yarn for the outside and solid on the inside. Gave first one as a gift. Making my second one with red heart yarn and going to see if it will work for makeup brushes. Thank you so much or all your videos. Love how you go straight to instructions.

Do you have a written pattern? The link on your website does NOT lead to the same pattern. I WANT this hook case not the one at the other end of the link.
Perfect explanation.  Thank you.
Can I make this bigger and instead of flat can I make it so it rolls and I tie it.
Thank you for sharing. I just discovered this pattern and its one of the best hook holders i have came across. I do use ergonomic hooks so my handles are wider with a rubber grip so that is posing a challenge because they will not fit. I have tried a few different methods and it did come out to be significantly larger , i am thinking i should try a size 5 hook to see how that works out because of my tension. But after reading the comments i am definitely going to try the triple crochet in place of the doubke crochet to see how that goes. But overall, this is an amazing tutorial that is very easy to understand and follower even for a beginner
It’s a shame the creator passed, she seemed wonderful to have shared her pattern with you.  This will definitely be one I write down for myself.
Is it better to make this with acrylic yarn or cotton yarn?
Excuse me. How many millimeters of thread? 5mm?
I made one started a second one it was a great  thank you so very much for doing it
Thank you so much for posting this detailed and easy to follow tutorial!  Is it possible to modify the width of the pockets to fit ergonomic crochet hooks?  Also, what are the needed dimensions for the plastic canvas inserts recommended to stiffen the front and back covers?  Thank you for any suggestions!
Donna... omg I'm almost finished mine! I absolutely loved making it. Can easily be made in a day if you have all the materials (I had to get the plastic things lol). I was absolutely overjoyed that you used the cross stitch for the cover. That was the very first "hard" stitch I learned from a kindly older woman who taught a group of us at a women's shelter.  My version is opposite from yours though. I go through the back and insert the hook through the front of the stitch. I also used a single crochet between the rows to really make the Xs pop, crocheting into the space between the Xs and into the stitches for the rest.  It looks amazing! I just have to join the other side of the cover, do my seams, add inserts, the button loop...  then find a button I like. Thanks so much for taking the time to teach this pattern💕
wish i could crochet well enough to make this!! its amazing.
Hi, made this, love it , in need of way to make another one but with WIDE HOOK POCKETS  (to hold wide manicure tools)..tried larger hook shirt yarn, didn't work ... PLEASE your advice
Hello, do ergonomic hooks fit?
Hi, this case would be perfect to make with scrap yarn.  Can’t wait to make one.  Sorry to read the original creator has passed. Thank you for sharing it with us.
Thank you for this❤️,now my hooks has their own bag
Hi Donna, love your training, excellent!  I am making the Crochet Hook Case and the pockets are not going to be large enough for my ergo hooks; do you think treble crochet on the pockets will enlarge them enough without ruining the pattern?
Row 2 10 dc 20 dc blo  Row 3  20 dc flo Ch Two
Just made this for my Pioneer Woman branded hook set that were pricey. They sold a matching case but that was another $20. So I bought a skein of PW yarn and made a matching case for them using this wonderful pattern and I love it! ❤
When attaching the first cover, you say go into your dc. You had us do sc. you move so fast I can’t see your work because your camera is to close to the project.
Thank you for the clear instructions. What do you do to expand your pocket?
Thank you for this tutorial.  I finished a case.  I tried to find the written instructions but the website is no longer available.  Do you know where else I could find the written instructions?
Do you have suggestions for how to make the pockets bigger for clover amour hooks instead of the slim metal ones in the video example?  Thank you!  I want to make this but my hooks have fatter handles.

I made a smaller version 2 years ago from the written pattern when I was a beginner. I didn't use any plastic to make it rigid. Today I made this big one and stuck in plastic dividers from an old day planner. Wow. If you are wondering whether to do this step DO IT, you will thank yourself.
sorry I cant follow you too complicated for me anyway I like your pattern.
Does anyone have the written pattern? The website its on no longer works
Thankyou so much Naztazia. I followed your tutorial for a hook case. I love it.
I made this 8 years ago pink on the outside and yellow inside. I love it and want to make another but bigger for knitting needles. Thank you for sharing this video tutorial.
hey, i want to make this but i only want the hook pockets on one side, if i repeat row 2 and 3 untill round 11 like u did, then make the spine on row 12-15, what would i do for row 12-25? would i do dc only? i want to make sure i do it right so its the same size and loosk the same, just without the hook pockets on that side.
I would like the written directions. but it seems the website for that is down, Does anyone know where I can find it? THANKS, PS I see this was 8 yrs ago,,,,
Hey Donna!! I really don't know how to say thanks to you. I am a beginner and today I have just completed this case by using your friendly guidelines. The only changes I made was additional big pocket along with 5 pockets on each side to put my scale gauge, inches tape, scissors, threader, row counters and other necessary accessories of both crochet and knitting. Not to mention it came out beautiful. I used dark brown colour of yarn and now that I have completed it , everyone loved it. Thanks a lot dear. God bless you and your family.
Felicitaciones Maestra por cada creación suya son espectaculares...EXELENTE  tutorial. Desde Paraguay cariños ❤
الترجمة إلى العربية سيئة جداً.
17:33 I made one from a multi-colored red heart yarn given as a gift.  I loved how the pattern created a great design.
Unfortunately the link to the pattern doesn't work & the link to the website is odd! Shame.
Hermosos trabajos saludos desde España 😊
Love this pattern so much. I tried to make it a couple years ago only to realize that it doesn't fit my hooks as I use ergonomic hooks. I also wanted a pockets for all my little extras ( like yarn needles, tape measurer, stitch market, etc.) So I modified the pattern by adding SC rows and also made it into a binder. That way I can fit all my hooks (have about 25) and all the extras. A friend saw it when I was done and took it. No I need a new case. 😀😂🤣 As if I need another WIP. Lol. Thanks so much for sharing this and making the video. The written instructions are a little confusing.
Instead of dc I did triple so I could put my larger hooks in the case. Worked out great
Your tutorial is great except maybe I have missed something but you don't show how we join the 2nd and all the rest of the pockets, do we crochet them closed  on the ridge made from Flo and blo rows
Personall time stamp 7:18
Will the pockets be large enough to hold a Furls hook?
Is there a way to widen some of the pockets for a few wider hooks like ones with ergonomic handles?
Hi I am from Nigeria in Africa and I just wanted to ask what type of crochet hook and wool should I be using
Hi I am from Nigeria in Africa and I just wanted to ask what type of crochet hook and wool should I be using
I'm new at this and you're instructions are AMAZING!!!  This will be a Christmas gift for my mother in law. She's going to love this!!
Problem with th cover shrinking. Row 29 was ok. Ch 2 turn work begin row 30.  Double crochet in first stitch. Skip a stitch and double crochet. Then go back and double crochet in the skipped stitch. Somehow I messed things up because it kept getting smaller. After pulling it out a 100 times I finally gave up and just did a double crochet in each stitch. It's not as pretty. I wish you could have kept going on rows 30 through 38 instead of stopping recording 😢after row 30.
Super! What is the finished size, please?
Oh my goodness. I just finished this case. So beautiful. And I love it. Thanks for the tutorial
Do you still have a copy of the written pattern?  Her site is gone and on ravelry it has been discontinued
Thanks Donna for the well-explained tuition. I made ine but used the wrong yarn strength and it doesn't turn out that nice.
thank you for the lessons they were worth it
this is the best thing I have ever seen
I made lots of hok packet❤
Where can I find the written version?
The link for the website to this pattern is not working, it says there is a error or maybe the link may be wrong? Not sure but just wanted to let you know.
This was a super amazing video tutorial! Thank you for taking the time to make this video for us. I absolutely love it and will be sharing with my community and attempting to make one for myself and friends!😂❤
You never mentioned row 40…? I see, you said “next row”. Got it!
hi! love this pattern! is it ok if i translate it into dutch?
Tam aradigim bir tıg kutusu örneği.  Yalniz ne türkce dublaj var ne de Türkçe alt yazi var. Lutfen bu dikkat ederseniz sevinirim.

Tried to find written pattern wouldn’t bring me to the page
I’m still working on it had a little confusion but figured it out lol
I do cross stitch too I would put one of my cross stitch pieces on the outside to decorate it 😊
Io vorrei che fosse in Italiano
kannst du das video auf deutsch machen
I have always wanted to make a crochet hook case but never had the nerve 😅but thanks to your excellent instruction and presentation I can now make one. Thank you soo much Ma'am 💓
Is there a printed pattern???
Merhaba.. Seni Türkiye den takip ediyorum.. Lütfen altyazı seçeneğine   Türkçe yi de ekler misin 💕💕🇹🇷
Hi Donna 👋🏽! I've been watching your tutorials on Facebook and YouTube and want to let you know that I have learned so much about Crocheting from both. What interest me was your post on "Crochet Tools." Especially the Yarn Winder and the Yarn Color Wheel, both I am going to be buying soon. So is there any practical place that you would suggest getting both from? As always "Thank you for being a great "Fibercrafte Instructor 🧶🪡😍!!
I still can not find the pattern
Priscilla’s website no longer exists. I’m unable to get a written copy of this pattern.
gostei, fica mais organizadas as agulhas, vou fazer pra mim, obrigada por nos ensinar ❤️😘
This is amazing thanks for all your efforts
Thanks this is beautiful
Hi there. I added an extra pocket on the second one I made, instead of five, I made six pockets. I’m going to try one with 7. Thank you for sharing your videos. I love your pace.
Amazing tutorial!! I just started crocheting and wanted to try this out but was worried it was too advanced. Thanks for taking the time to go through everything so thoroughly! I’m going to try it! And I subscribed!
Thank you for sharing this video.  It was easy to follow.
Thank you so much.   This video appeared for me exactly as I have become a little overwhelmed by my disarray of my ever growing hook collection.  I will need to add a few more pages to my book but this is the perfect solution.  Your tutorial is perfectly presented and very easy to follow.  Thanks again.  ♡☆☆☆☆☆
Hi Donna. Is there a way to make this case in such a way that it would work to store tunisian hooks? Really like this pattern.
This is exactly what I’m looking for. Thank you for sharing your pattern x
Love this video! Its so clear and easy to follow! Apparently Ms Priscilla has passed and her website is no longer in operation. Does anyone have a copy of the written instructions?!
First day of crocheting and i think crocheting this is more advanced! I made one and i hope it helps in the future when i need it. Thanks!
Will clover Amore hooks fit in this case?????
Hola soy de España  me gusta mucho el estuche para ganchillo por qué todo los ganchillo los tengo metido en una caja y me gustaría tenerlo en orden pero no veo el patrón gracia
Hi..how to make the pocket broader...? Cause I have bigger hook
Hello there! I made it but the new kind of crochet hook with the plastic handle doesn't fit into the slots. Really sorry about that.I am thinking of changing dubble crochet for triple crochet.  That wil make the slots so much wider. I really like the stich on the outside, tried it on a scarf 🧣.  Beautiful
Row 2: 1:40 Row 3: 4:17
Hola soy de argentina muy lindo .pero no está bien explicado para realizar saludo
I am a beginner and this tutorial is so easy to follow! I am trying to make this for my hooks that have some grip padding, how would you suggest making the pockets broader to fit those in? Thanks!
OK. i know I’m late to the party ( since this vid is years old). But I’m so excited to have found it!  I just purchased a new gorgeous set of hooks and was a little annoyed to find i didn’t have a safe place to keep them all together.  Starting immediately after this post 😄 Thankyou, Thankyou!
Row 2: 1:41
Hermoso trabajo gracias por compartirlo
Hi Donna how are you doing today iam doing fine today drinking water working  on my knitting top iam  going to make the crochet hook  case  it looks very easy to do thank you for sharing with everyone stay safe 💜 💙 😊
I'm making this for the second time. This time I modified the pattern to be trifold and fit my ergonomic Clover hooks. I did linked stitches to eliminate holes and I made the pockets larger for my Clover hooks. Even one big enough for my P/Q hook. I'm now about to make the back cover using herringbone stitch pattern. Linked stitches make this pattern perfection imo.    I might make another and film it for YouTube.
Thank you so much for posting this. It's a challenge but I am making it customized for me with 6 pouches per side so I can fit all 12 of my hooks and more!
자동자막 한국어도 부탁드려 봅니다🙏 south korea 입니다
Adding this for everyone's reference  r2: 1:44 r3: 4:19  r4-r11: 5:11  Thank you
In addition to the plastic canvas or cardboard, you can spruce things up even more by sliding in a patterned, colored, or glittery sheet of scrapbook paper. It shows through the cover where the gaps from the stitches are. Very cool effect!
Can I change the color of the outside cover ? How can I do that ?
Hi Naztazia I'm having some difficulty with the second half of the pattern basically I'm at the double end bottom of the pocket and to start the other side am I suppose to be at the bottom working towards the top of the pockets I'm trying to follow the video but where it comes to starting the second half I'm really confused if I'm suppose to be starting at the bottom or top can you please try and explain it to me thank you I love this pattern and I really want to finish it can you please get back to me thank you and thank you again for sharing this video tutorial
I am not quite sure if this will work, but I am going to try to make this into a pencil case for school and just add more folds to it to be able to put more pencils and pens for school inside it.
👪🌷❤️👍💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Queria fazer um .Bem que podia ser em Português.Nao achei nenhuma igual a essa ensinada por nenhuma crocheteira brasileira
Thank you very much for the pattern and video. I liked this case alot and decided to make it for my tulips. Just not possible.  Please note that, this pattern will only be good for thin and fully straight hooks with no wider handle. Silicon handle hooks, or wider handle hooks will not fit into these double crochet pockets with this hook size and yarn size. Perhaps larger hooks >= 12 mm will have trouble to enter the pockets too. even if they do not have extra handle materials.  I tried double layering my yarn and crochet with a 6 mm hook instead of suggested F (3.75 mm) in the video, which made the product to be quite looser than the original. And the wider upper parts of the silicone handle was still forcefully entering the pockets.   I then tried it with double layering my yarn, using 5.5 mm hook and doing triple crochet insead of double crochet, the silicone handles were fitting but I did not like how loose triple crochet made the overall product.   So I finally decided to knit a longer version of this with 40+ starter chains and the suggested yrn/hook size and pattern for my straight metal tunusians and straight metal hook set.  For my tulips and other silicone handle hooks and 12+ mm larger hooks, I will look for another pattern that I can freely crochet the outer case and pocket part separately, then sew the pockets deciding their width according to my needs.
How do I repeat row 2 on the next flap if I do that it will go on the other side
Mrs Donna row 28 is throwing me off, when I back loop only the “ridge” is showing up on the inside where the hook pockets are not the backside with other BLO rows is this correct? I have frogged for nearly 3 days haha!
Thanks for your lovely lessons and beautiful patterns for crochets. Love and hugs from Belgium, Cindy 😘
Bedankt
I know it's a super old meme but when I saw the thumbnail/title, the first thing I thought was "Yo dawg, I heard you like crochet, so I put some crochet in your crochet so you can crochet while crocheting"
Desearía que  lo hablará en español
My great idea will be zipper. So don’t fall out.  Lots craft person on the go.  More easy crocket hooks
I've been looking for a pattern for my hooks, and here it is! Thank you for sharing this pattern ❣ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Donna

Lovely.. I am doing it right now
You say do DC but in the video you are doing triples. Does it make a difference?
Bonjour bravo bonne idée ''''👍💐🌹
Thank you, it looks great. I will defenetly try to make this. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations ❤❤❤
Awesome everyone needs more than one hook case, thank you Donna for a wonderful tutorial.
Hi! The link in the descripction doesnt work ! D:  Wonder tutorial :3
Row 2: 1:50  Row 3: 4:24
Hello, i love this pattern, but i can’t find the written pattern on Priscilla site. Can anyone help me please. Thanks
Beautiful thank you 🙏
I love this but got sooo confused after row 5. I just wanna get this right so bad!
It looks like the link to Mrs. Hewitt's website is expired.  Is there any way I could get the written instructions?
Can I use 3mm crochet hook ?
I went to look for the pattern but sadly Priscilla passed away in December.  The written pattern is discontinued and is no longer available through her website (it has expired) or on Ravelry.
De link naar geschreven patroon doet het niet  En nu kom ik niet verder want ik schrijf het altijd op of vink het aan als ik aan het haken ben
La quiero y admiro. Sus tejidos son inigualables
I made one  thank you …
Just to let you know that I just love all your tutorials. Also to tell you that I appreciate all you do.  😊
Nice!! Really clever 👍👏🙂
Just found this and want to make it, but Priscilla’s website has expired. Is there some other place to download the pattern for free?
Do you have the written pattern? The link no longer works.
There is no written pattern anymore.  Says website unavailable 😕
I just found this video and I love it. I recently bought a set of hooks with needles, tape measure and other little things that come in a little bag. It's such hassle trying to get the right hook from the whole lot (15 of them). This will definitely keep them all organized and ready. All is explained very clearly and it's so easy to follow. Thank you. ☺♥
Does anyone have the written pattern? The website is no longer active.
日本語
I made this and used a thick piece of card stock because I didn’t have the canvas!
Discontinued. This digital pattern is no longer available online.
i have tried everywhere to get patteren and can not find it do you have a proper link
Today I knew nothing about crochet and I started making some chains but I tried to make rows and I do it how you do the 1st row😂
I wonder if you could add a crocheted page to the spine?  If you did, you could make special loops for scissors, stitch markers and darning needles, and or…you could make a triple crochet pocket or two for very large hooks?  I also plan to add a small crocheted pocket to the outside front, and I might make my border for my hook case in another colour of yarn.  I decided to make mine with a handcrafters cotton yarn to make it washable.  *Note-  I suppose if you wanted to add a third page to the inside spine, you might want to add a single crochet row to each side of the case that would allow for the extra space needed for more hooks inside?
Wow.
Happy new year to you. Thanks for the lovely crochet hook case, very useful to carry your whole set. God bless you ✌❤
Can anyone tell me the uk hook sizes for this please
The website to the pattern is expired.
I found the perfect needle holder, thank you Donna.
When closing the first pocket I had zero luck trying to get 20 sc down to the end. I did it over and over and over again, counting over and over again. I checked all my previous stitches and they were right on. I can’t figure out how to get 20 sc out of it. Just going cRaZy over here because I REEEEAAALLLY want to make this! EDIT: the missing stitch was where the two rows come together at the end.
thanks Naztaza for show the video crochet hook case holder so easy to learn and understant i love crochet  you have a good day  have a Merry christmas & Happy new year
I do not understand 4 to 11 rows. Take about this video please!
You should add a pocket in the back for patterns.
I love this pouch!! Can it also be used for knitting needles?
Im a beginner.. And I decided to give this a try.. And it turned out great.. Super easy to follow.. And I am in love with the case
Good morning my Dearest Lady. I love your work and the way you are explaining. I JUST SUBSCRIBED TO YOUR CHANNEL WITHOUT WASTING TIME. May Our Almighty GOD continue to Bless you  Abundantly and let His LIGHT SHINE UPON YOU in everything you do. YOU'RE A STAR. All the Greetings from South Africa💖💖💖
I need to try and adapt this for my tunisian hooks I think.
I had gotten a set of bamboo hooks that started with size P. I created a case for these larger sized hooks.  Used buttons to close and a little pocket for my yarn needle holder.
Please keep crocheting. So WONDERFUL 😍
I like it
hi i got a question.  will hook whit a handle will fit in pockets?
Best crochet video ever,its the best gift to my niece😍
Thanks for the great tutorial!! 💚😊💚😊
I’m confused with the second hook holder. I can’t work out where to join and then where to start row 5!  Anyone help?
شكرا شكرا
A great idea ,thank you for  sharing ,I’m going to try to make this !💕💕
Really enjoying working on this project!! Was wondering if there’s any way to add a third “page” on the middle, maybe make it double sided? If you or anyone else has any recommendations I would really appreciate it, thank you!!
Cute case. Should list plastic canvas in the beginning when describing items needed for the project. I got my items described and followed along until oops! There’s a surprise item needed that I don’t have! Guess we won’t finish today.
Thank you so much. Just completed mine. Love it
Wow really nice.  Thanks for showing us.  Janice from Malta ❤
I've made 3 of these ABSOLUTELY love it!!!! I just made the last one but I have added pages to the book it holds so much stuff thank you!!!! I watch all your stuff everything is so unique!!! As always you make everything so easy!!! Thank you Again!!! <3
Hello, very easy to understand tutorial. One question though, how would I alter this to fit ergonomic crochet hooks?
1:47 4:20 7:08
I am made by hook holder 🥰
I made one, adding a small pocket to the outer right side, for small scissors, post-it notes, a tape measure, etc. I love it! It never leaves my side! Thank you both Donna & Priscilla. Hugs
What is the purpose of doing single crochet on the back loops only and then marking the front loop on row 28? I didnt see it referred to later at all.
OMG, I love this project! SI ended up making it in less than two days and used 100 gr. Thank you so much!
I'm 14 and I made exactly like yours thanks a lottttt 😇😇😇
Hi, I’m new at crochet and would like to know how to determine how much yarn I’d need for a project like that? Thank you!
what kind of yarn do u use on this project?🥰
Loved tank you look so good
I would love doing the same thing for my knitting needles.
naztazia crochet  shoes and instractions
Approximately how much yarn will be used for this project... I have 50gms 4ply cotton yarn...Will that be enough
Aj krabička aj na ihlice
I love this thank you i couldnt find the yarn that is strong to stay up till now
Thanks a lot for this project. I am 12 years old and I am finding this project very easy and also completed it.
This is really nice so I made one for my hooks in color brown. Very useful indeed. Thanks Donna!
Well I am just gonna have to try this. No need to buy a case when you can make your own. Thank you for sharing a great tutorial.
Gostaria de um grafico para fazer estojonde lapis de cor
That is so cool 😎 it definitely gose to my to do list 👌⚘
I've just beginning to take interest in crochet amigurumi n today i chanced upon this video n i would love to try this. I am excited n I hope im able to follow. Best of luck to me!!
I’m wondering how I could make the pockets a little bigger? I have some crochet hooks that have the rubber handle and they are not fitting in the pockets I’m making right now.
love this project I want to make several of these. Thank you Naztazia
what if i want to make it bigger ? how many chain  ? thank you
Hi Naztazia, I love your tutorial easy to understand. Long time I did not see your videos. That you.
Can this be made larger to hold more hooks?
Also, with a little tweaking here and there, this would make a cute purse.  Make the pockets a bit wider for your items, though, of course.
LOVE, LOVE, *LOVE* THIS PATTERN!!!  I am a crocheted and  knitter.  I am also into so many other crafts such as needlepoint, painting, jewelry making, etc..  Now, I'm wanting to make this crochet hook holder, and, figure out how to make a knitting needle holder - plus, I'm wanting to make a bag to hold my different crafting items in.  I've *never* known how easy it could be to make your own crochet hook holder, though.   I just really love this pattern.   Thank you for sharing it with us !
Loved it.    Thanks a lot 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🥰
Short and sweet
I am a beginner in crochet I really want to make this, wish me luck lol
Just love your pattern i just made for Myself..  Thank u for sharing

oh my gosh i watched this with fascination, i am not as good as you so that will take me 10 tries for me to get it right. you are a remarkable talent, plus you are a wonder woman raising your kids and probably juggling a career, kudos to you and i cant wait to try this project
I swear this is one of my absolute favorite projects that I have made over the years.  I recently got some Tunisian hooks, and just HAD to make a new case for them... and of course a gift for my friend and my sister!  Lol, I hope that they do not see this comment!  <3 <3 <3 this case!
Fantastic tutorial, but I realized that this would not accommodate my ergonomic hooks. So I’m replacing the double crochets for treble crochets, and the turning chains I’m increasing by 1. I’m using Caron Simply Soft and a 5.5mm hook. I hope this works. Thanks for a great tutorial.
Спасибо, 👍👍👍буду пробовать вязать такой же органайзер для организации хранения крючков.

I love this case and have gifted it to a friend. I can't fit my hooks in the pockets since they are bigger ergonomic hooks. Can you tell me how to modify the pockets please? I would really like to make one for myself. Thanks much. Izzy
I wonder if a can make a slightly larger one for my knitting needles 🤔 i love the way this pattern turned out thank you
I cannot find the pattern please
Really like this case it’s very neat.
I’m 55 and have been crocheting for just over a year and found this pattern very easy to follow.
I would like to make this case, but i dont have any small hook. How do i make it for bigger hooks?
row 2-1:46 row 3- 4:21
wow! you explained this so well 😊 thank you so much!
Do you have pattern for knitting needle
Would ergonomic hooks fit in this case
5 years later and still one of the best looking covers 😊. Can’t wait to start!
I just completed the case except for the button.  Your instructions are excellent and so clear.  I also printed off a copy of the pattern.  Somehow the outside cover on one side ended too long!  No worries as I was able to work out a solution.  I did use the plastic inserts as you showed.  Mine is a dark hunter green and non-crocheters think it’s wonderful. HaHa I going to make another very carefully in a light color.  I’m also going to make one as a journal cover.  Love your site and subbed.
Hi, Miss Donna, I viewed your tutorial and visited Miss. Hewitt's written pattern.  I noticed that in the written pattern, there are 2 R43 mentioned with different instructions.  It might be confusing to beginners.  Thank you for this tutorial and more power to your channel :)
Very beautiful crochet hook case, I just made one. Thank you for the video.
I love all your patterns, thank you for sharing your knowledge, I have made several of your patterns.
Ehsan from EGYPT ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Dear NZTAZIA I WATCHING your channel I love your tuutorial  so much Simple and easy  Thank you Very much
Thank you so very much for this video.  I made mine with 6 hooks holding spots and I left the top open for patterns which I need to learn. 🙂 I have taught myself with YouTube.
If I wanted to do a bigger pocket I could just do two rounds on the front and back loops, right? Some of my hooks are big
Love this! Could I do a different color for the outer and inner case? For example a multicolor yarn for the outside but a solid for the inside?
Hi! Awesome tutorial!! I’m somewhat new to crocheting and thought I’d try this out. Found it easy to do soo thank you. I do however have one question, is there anyway to alter pattern to make the pockets to fit ergonomic handles? Did two pockets to find out they don’t fit my hooks😔. Anyway to make pockets bigger. Thank you. Take care.
I am 10, and I just started day 1 I finished I pocket very nice day 2 I finished 4 more
Much much love for your work. I'm a big fan!
What would you charge me I'm one of your subscribers Hawaiian day I'm the yarn needle things that you make how much would you charge to make me want
I just finished making this and thought I had gone wrong - it was back to front , maybe because I’m left handed... or maybe because I went wrong where, it turned out ok. Might make another one and be a bit more careful! Be good to give as gifts to my crochet group - thanks
Hello there!! Thanks for the pattern!! Awesome. Could you tell me the size of the case? Cause I think it’s becoming too big. In centimetres if you can. Thank you!
Wow😍❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
Love this tutorial.  You make it all so easy to understand.   Thank you very much.
For anyone do it! How many wool balls use ! to do  it??
I also made a bigger one for my knitting needles!
Thank you so much for sharing this pattern! I love it !!!!!!!!!
Tusen takk! Jeg elsker det!
I just finished this project with using your video tutorial and I absolutely love it. I thought it was going to be complicated but it came together so easily. It was so much fun, I want to make a second one just for the enjoyment of it!
Do I need to have the plastic things to put into the case? Or is that optional?
Hi this is Belicia I have made this case for my hooks and i always follow your instructions.
Thank you so much for this tutorial! I greatly enjoyed following it, and after some minor alterations to the instructions it perfectly fits all my crocheting needles, even the ones with the super thick plastic handle~ I was really surprised i could do it so well!
Is this okay for a beginner?
The picture shown looks like there are 2 rows of pockets.  Please advise!
Could someone please tell me if my ergonomic Furls streamline hook will fit in the pockets since the body is a big fatter than most of the metal and plastic hooks? TIA.
Ok this is clever. I expected it to be 2 pieces stitched together to form the pockets. I think I'll make this when I've finished all Christmas presents.
I’ve made 6 of these so far, love them, gave to all my relatives for birthdays and such, filled with everything they need, They love them! Such an easy tutorial to do, Thank you so much!
Just finished mine odds 3:52 am lol love it to pieces mine of baby pink and dark pink
i'd love the print out patter please
Loving this pattern so far! Not sure where i’ve gone wrong, but when I reached the final pocket i suddenly realised that my last 4 pockets were on the opposite side of the work to my first one. I started again and worked into the front of the loops to start with in row 2 and everything ended up on the same side that time around.
Thank you for sharing and explaining this amazing pattern with us! Just finished my work (which I'm very happy about!) and subscribed for your channel!
Muy bonito y queda fuerte. Estoy contenta de suscribirme. Gracias!
I'm making  this now with wool from Aldi doubled up and am really enjoying making it..easy to follow x
I made this and it looks goodbut the hooks keep slipping out ☹️
💖💖💖Just finished doing this and. I really love it.
شكراً جزيلاً
Thank you so much with this pattern. Just about finished & plan on making a few as gifts
I wanna make this for my knitting needles
Thank you
Thank you so much for sharing ❤️
I am Indian please explain Tamil or Hindi language very useful for me and others Indians
Ciao Naztazia, come mai non ricevo più da tempo i tuoi tutorial pur essendo iscritta? e attivata la campanella,grazie
Hi naztazia I’m 12 and I’ve been crocheting for about a year and a half now.  I wanted to say thx for making this tutorial so now I have a hook and knitting needle case   So thank u for that 🙏🏼 😊 and yeah it’s been really fun making this
Wow beautiful
شكرا
Español
Iam Egyptian.and love each your work.well done.👏👏💐
Very nice, thank you.
I guess you put the extra hooks in so neatly it looks like extra pockets!  LOL  I loved making this - and to have actually finished, except for the button, is amazing to me.  This is better than the one my friend found at a county fair made with pop tabs from cans!  Nice, but I like 'yours' better.  TY!!
Where is the pattern for the case with the extra pockets??  I finished this one - but ran out of yarn so had to finish with a different color.  Came out better than expected, thanks to you.
The intro i wanna see that video its so biggggg😰😰😰
I hope you enjoy this crochet hook case. I received word that Ms. Priscilla left this world in Dec 2021. It is a loss to the crochet world. Understandably the site with the written pattern isn't functioning at this time. On my own site I have a link to the web archive that has the written pattern if interested https://naztazia.com/crochet-hook-holder-case/
hi there! I'm crocheting this pattern right now and I want to use different colors for the inside and outside of the case and I'm unsure which row would be the best to start on the outer color, do you have any advice? thanks for your video, makes it much easier to follow the pattern than just reading it!
Nice work I subscribed to your channel please subscribe to your channel
Donna what if our canvas size is 5×3.25 inches
I love this pattern and LOVE your video. The only problem I have is that, although I have many aluminum hooks,  I use ergonomic hooks now and they don't want to go in! Well, this will be good for the aforementioned aluminum hooks. Thanks so much for making this video! :) <3
😍❤️🍃👍🏻🥰👍🏻🍃❤️😍
I made this and it turned out to be a beautiful gift. Thank you.
Can I use The same recipe to make a pencil case..?
This is the second one of these that I made.   Several people have commented on the first one, so I thought I'd try this pattern.  I like it a lot!  The only thing that could be better is one where the opening is big enough for the ergonomic handled hooks.
Did the printed pattern have mistakes??
The pattern shows Row 43 twice.  One for the Marker 1 and then again to repeat Row 41.  I'm enjoying the making of this patt - and can't believe it's almost done - hoping to not run out of yarn.  Oops ... Red Heart Super Saver Shocking Pink Rose - made a Pussy Hat and this hook holder is the remainder after the hat.  Thank you for this!
Finally finished this project (: thankyou
Just found this pattern and I was absolutely amazed by the clever design - it really is superb! I shall be starting mine tonight, I even have some Red Heart grey in my stash which will be perfect! Thank you Donna for bringing it to life for us, and thank you Mrs Hewitt too of course.
You are such an excellent teacher and make great tutorials ❣️❣️❣️ thank you 😊
It's very easy to understand thank you . Lots of love from India🙂
Oh wow your close to 1 million subscribers, exciting

I looked at this 2 weeks ago and decided  no way I would  be  able to follow this,but hey ho I've just finished  it,I'm so proud of my self,thanks so much you aren't excellent  teacher💝
I made this rainbow on the inside and cappuccino brown on the outside with a fancier border & snail 🐌 clip instead of a button also instead of closing the tops I added hidden zippers to use for store for sissors and my circle needles. I loved loved loved this design! Thanks so much!!!

I  love  this  pocked  Crochet  pattern.
Thanks for this - I'd forgotten how to do this. I have adapted this for knitting needles, so I used triple crochet for the width of the pockets and did mine with a cast on of 50 (20/30) to fit my longest needles in the pockets and shorter ones piercing pocket, so I can get 3 lengths of needles in one pocket - it's awesome :-). Of course I had to make more rows for the "cover" as it was done in double crochet. I also realised that I could put my crochet hooks in here too.
Super!!!  TY!!
You can customize how many pockets are on each side. I'm making this for 8 crochet hooks so I'm just eyeballing how many rows I do for the outside cover it's not that hard to manage and its coming out great. Love it!
This is so cool. I’m in the process of making one right now and I love this pattern. It’s very sturdy.
How to make more pockets for my many fountain pen collection?  this is great for storing them I just need more pockets for 40 pens.please advise
This is the second pattern I will create from you. I really love the way you explain and what you create. Keep Rocking it out!
Absolutely loved it...going to gift myself one....😁
Very very nice.Thank you.
💝lichen Dank 🌻🌻🌻 So wunderbar das Täschchen für Häkelhaken, wo ich so eine Chaostante bin 😊 Liebe Grüße Andrea
I'm going to make this for sure! I have a case that zips, but need more storage for hooks. Going to try and see about adjusting the pocket size by loosening tension or using different stitches because almost all of my hooks have the ergonomic grips. Not sure if they would fit in these pockets. Fingers crossed!
From this video I have also made a three sided case instead of this
I have made everything u have posted but I would love if u make sweaters and frocks I have made some but  if u will make a video it will be more easy as u r the best u clear everything u r the decent one who can help people how they want to be so i just want to say that u tell of how to make sweaters and frocks plz plz
Thank u so much Donna u r the best ur videos r the best and from thus video I have made 10 cases for sketch pencils and even crochet and also gifted some people and yes I am using 3 for my school stationary as I am only 14
Love it
Thank you so much for sharing this tutorial...I love it ❤️
is there a written pattern??
When making the pockets is there a way to make them wider for like the hooks with the rubber ends on them?
Thats so cool!
Amazing Donna! I love the way you explain your work. Excellent professional!
I needed to increase the pockets with 1 row for them to fit with my ergonomic hooks, but I'm trying to find a way to connect it with the upper part. Anyone have any ideas?
I've made two of these and this has got to be one of the smartest patterns I've ever done! The fact that the entire thing is worked with one continuous string is unreal!! You end up with only a beginning and ending tail to tuck in. Not to mention how insanely organized it makes me feel. I attach my stitch markers on the loops going up the left side and put my darning needles on the right. I also use one pocket for my long skinny scissors and one for a pencil. Double piercing halfway down like she suggest leaves tons of room for my hooks. Cannot rave enough about this pattern. Try it! 😍
Time stamps  row 2: 1:44  Row 3: 4:15
I'm doing this for my hooks but can I ask if this can also be a case for pencils and ballpens? Or are they too small?

I am really struggling with this. Can you make a video of the 2nd pocket as well. I am really getting lost on where to connect the 2nd pocket. Thank you!
I was going v well. Got stuck when I had to join on second spine. Can't figure out
I'm doing this pattern but every single time the count is off.  I'm so frustrated right now I can't believe it. I've counted precisely and it still comes up wrong. Any advice from anyone??
Wow it's so beautiful but I don't think I can ever make it. Though I desperately need one. Anyways thank you. Your videos are a delight to watch.
Thank you
❤️😍🍃👍🏻🥰👍🏻🍃😍❤️
Thanks for sharing. Your videos has help me a lot in crocheting. I am your new fan.
Great idea and explained so well. I have been using Dollar Tree pencil holders to hold my hooks. This is so much more stylish when crocheting on the go. Thanks!
Thanks Naztazia for the crochet hook holder idea.
Que bueno que el subtitulo en español
Супер. Спасибо за субтитры. Подписка.
A really nice pattern, I'm going to give it a go...
Hi I'm Italian and I just met you and I really like how you explain. I would also like to make the crochet hook but made of cotton. Could you please tell me the measurements? Thank you and good evening.
Started this project about 30 minutes ago. I've got so much going on today, I can see this is going to be an all evening job.
Took me a few tries because i lacked confidence that i was getting my stitches even, but i finally did it. I even crocheted a flower to be the button.
Классный кейс!👏👍👍
I just mash this love it😍
do you have a video on how to make a case for ''long knitting needles'' ?
I thought to complicated but read comments  11 yr old made it I know must try
I Have the Clover crochet hooks. They have a thick handle. Is there anyway I can make the pockets for the crochet hooks bigger to fit my clover crochet hooks?
Bellissimo
THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR LOVE OF CROCHETING ! WONDERFUL TUTORIAL.!
Хорошо вяжет мастерица.
Love the crochet case I don't know that I could do that thank you
I love this 😍 Almost done with it, just has to add the back. It is my second crochet project ever. I was wondering about changing the outer case color. Which round marks the start of the outer case? Which round should I change the color? Thank you for the easy tutorial 🌸

Könnten sie dieses video auch deutsch filmen

I love this video. I got to row 15, and started on row 16. I am making this for my mom and my daughter. Thanks for this video. Priscilla did a wonderful job in giving the pattern out. I love this case. After I make my moms and daughters case, I will make one for myself. That way I can keep all my hooks in one place instead hunting for them.
Ficou lindo!
I am crocheting it to keep my coloured threads according to  it's size.
Please show me how to do kable
Legal... eu pego a agulha assim...😍
Sooo beautiful thanks for you

This is awesome. I can't wait to make this
I’m gonna make this for my tombow dual brush tip pens since they’re so long!
I love you videos. Fom mexico.
I go to follow the pattern and your site is under construction 😢
Someone was wondering if you have this pattern for left handed people?
I'm on row 4, how do I connect them to make the pocket? I wish it were more detailed
I have several WIPs, but they will have to wait until I get this done. It will be the perfect gift for my crochet buddy. Thanks and keep up the good work. I love your diversity.
I love it. I don't know how to making those the picture. I am wish u were give to me, I am learning to making a crochet not too easy step by step! Thank you , I am deaf person. 😂😂
Thank you so much for this exelent explaint tutorial. Big love from Germany
I loved this. I will make this today
Thank you, i've only been crocheting 1 month so your video was of great help, i have adapted the case so that i can get 12 Clover hooks each side, im just trying to figure out how to add a zipper now!
time stamp for row two?
Excelente video! Gracias x compartir tus conocimientos!! Saludos desde La Plata, Argentina.-
Mega eu amei ,facio e maravilhoso
Well I tried about 10 times ,printed out the instructions, but can't  seem to make this one.  After creating the first pocket it just don't make sense to me it seem like the more pockets I created it just look like a lot of jumble.
Hi there. Yep I agree--ur tutorials are Outstanding especially the detail. Am currently working on this project and want to substitute hdc's for the initial single crochet stitches bcuz I want a sturdier fabric and want to know if dbl crochet stitches can be substituted to make the pockets large enuff for the handles of my makeup brushes. That's my ultimate purpose for this case. Also can it be made larger by increasing the base stitch count by 10 or how many?  Sorry for all the changes, but hope my questions will help others thinking the same. It really is a great case for multiple uses. :)
Bom dia maravilhoso trabalho parabéns.
Hi Donna I love and appreciate your videos.  I have a question about creating pockets I seem to get stuck only because after I have created the first pocket and half creating the second pocket not sure which way I should fold/form   the second pocket?
I made with trebles because my hooks are wide at the bottom.
I made one after watching your video. This is beautiful 😍😍
Row 2: 1:44 Row 3: 4:23
Hi again, I THINK I have just answered my own question.  Instead of doubles, I'm doing trebles for the pockets.  I've just done a little sample and they fit.  Hopefully it'll all work out.  Fingers crossed 😉
Hi Naztazia. First of all I agree with a lot me people who have commented, you are a brilliant teacher.  I have watched many videos on YouTube, but you ARE the best. I have just about finished this case and absolutely love it, but....... I've got lots of different hooks and some have the rubber like handle, therefore they're thicker.  Is there any way I can make the pocket a bit wider?  Again, thank you for all your doing for us learners
Hallo, es wäre schön wenn die anleitung auch auf Deutsch erklärt werden könnte, Danke lg aus 25813 Husum
Just finished except for button. I made the mistake of using a Manila folder and it shows thru. Love it anyway. Needs another one.
This hook holder was very nice can I get the same type of holder for pencils and pens and erasers
Muy práctico, gracias por el tutorial
How would you make this holder to hold the hooks with rubber grips on?
Amei
Thank you for the video! I just finished most of mine! I got to get some plastic canvas before I can finish completely!
Naztazia son hermosos tus trabajos!  Pero al colocar los subtitulo no deja ver el trabajo  muchas gracias bendiciones saludos desde Montevideo Uruguay! 🙌🙋👏👏👏👍😍💖😘
I love this pattern,  but I like the crochet hooks with the larger ergonomic handles. How can I alter the pattern to hold these types of hooks? Thank you for an easy to follow video tutorial.
Hi I made my crochet hook case after watching your video, appreciate your excellent and clear instructions , awesome
Me a gusta do muchisimo... mil gracias
Thanks  when I completed my next two projects am going to have a go at making this, x
U are unbelievable.  I croshe myself I like your instruction very clear.
Is there a way to make it easier when doing the last stitch of row “2” when joining the 2 pieces together for the holder?
Hello, I love this pattern and would love to make it with multiple pockets, how can I do this?
I love this but I can’t find the written pattern. Please help!
Great tutorial! Can't wait to make this! I just found out in the top right hand corner of the video where the 3 dots are you can slow down or speed up a video! A must with learning a pattern for a beg./inter. like me.
dear naztazia I started this case but it's not good for my hooks because they have the softgrip. How could I enlarge the hook pockets? Perhaps with treble crochet instead of double?
Grazie 🙏 x aver messo i sottotitoli in italiano..👏👏👏👏
Guess my grandmas a great teacher and my mom is a great teacher too!lol
I am 10 and have been knitting and crocheting since I was4
👍👍👍!!!!!
Thanks a million. Today I'm done this case it takes only a day (yesterday half day & today half day). I made with purple. It's so beautiful. May God bless you.
Just finished one for myself.
Will these pockets hold ergonomic hooks?
😍😍😍
感謝你加上中文字幕🙏🙏😘
Gracias  por la traducción  al español. Me ha encantado.lo haré. Un saludo.
My needles have rubber handles how would I make my pockets wider to fit them? Maybe a treble stitch instead of a double
estupendo  estuche. gracias  por  compartir
Thumb up and sebscribed 👍
SMART 😍👍👍👍👍👍
Thank you💖
Finished mine today and love it! Ended up adding a zipper pocket to the back for my measure tape and scissors. This case was bigger than I expected I thought it was gonna be smaller but it’s sturdy and super cute !!!!
I made this with a purple yarn I had. This was a great video! Thank you so much now I have an amazing case for my hooks!!
crochet LOVE❤️  cute😍  from JAPAN🙋🏻‍♀️
i jst learned crochet 2 months ago and i give this a try and thank u for sharing this video i cant wait to get done with my project.
What was that remaining green marker for? I'm almost done, and have 1 marker left too.
I love this hook case and use it all the time especially with my newest set of bamboo hooks.
Super pour ranger les crochet
I absolutely love this case! I've only been hooking a few months. Not good at written patterns, and I'd never be able to make this with just the written. But your tutorials are so well done, I'm going to give it a try. Thank you so much!
.
I swapped colors for the cover, I like how it turned out! My second finished project, so the outside stitch was awkward for a minute, but I got the hang of it. Thanks for the tutorial!!
🌹🌹🌹
الله عليكي مرتب
How do I get instructions on paper?
Hello I love the video I'm almost done with the case, but I modified it to have 3 panels and I have a quick question can I put a zipper to close it?  I would rather do a zipper for my 3 panels? And any suggestions on how to do that?
Just finished mine! I used cardboard from an old box instead of purchasing plastic canvas, and it works great! What a fantastic tutorial. Thank you!!!
SO HAPPY TO FIND THIS TUTORIAL 😀!!!  I LOVE IT 💝!!!  PRAYING I WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE MYSELF ONE SOON 🙏✝!  SO THANKFUL MS. HEWITT LET YOU DO A TUTORIAL ON THIS OR I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE EVER SEEN IT.  AWESOME JOB ON THIS DONNA, AS ALWAYS & THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH 😊💝!!!!
I loved this video
So glad I came across this tutorial. Thank you so much, this is just what I have been  looking for for some time now.  Love the pattern! It's beautiful!
your tutorials are crazy simple and easy to follow am gonna give it a go, thanks for sharing
字幕がすごいｗｗ

일본어 중국어도 있는데..한국어만 없어요ㅠㅠ
Thanks came out great!!!
I made one years ago for my mom.  I might have to make another for me!
Por favor ponga el tutorial en español
I'm lost....where do u pivot the front loops?
Kann man das auf deutsch auch haben ?
Hello, i love everything you do, and I like to ask you about "punto tunecino" .. can you learn anything?
Darn how......?? I made something similar when i was nine..... im 12 now btw and i still like to crochet
Posso usar a linha Camila Fashion  ?
Hey I couldn’t find the pattern, can someone send me a link to it or something, this is an amazing video but it’s easer for me to follow it on paper.
I customized mine a bit. instead of making two identical sides, I made one for the hooks and made the other side just a flap because I don’t have many hooks and I’m OCD thank you for the amazing tutorial keep up the great work Donna!!!!
Trying to make this, but at the 2nd pocket is where i am having trouble. I'm just getting it.  Cant seem to figure out that part. Your tutorial repeats rows, but i need to see how you actually do that 2nd pocket.
Thanks for sharing this tutorial. Anyone know if I would like to use different color of yarn for my cover, which row shall I start to use the different colour?
OMG this was so lovely and pretty.. u r just beautiful:)
This is one of the best practical crochet projects I have seen.  Can’t wait to start this as I am new to crochet and am rapidly collecting hooks😍.  Thank 🙏🏽you so much for sharing
Hi! I am beggining at croche. Can I try this work?
Donna if I wanted to make the right side solid with no hook pockets how many rows of DC do you suggest I do?
Hola! The translate  to Spanish Is not very good, but watching your vídeo is very  easy to understand you. Thnaks
Where did you get your scissors?
Wow you make it look so easy, others have had problems when they tried to do this case. I will give it a go...thank you.
جميل👏👏 بس ماكدر اسوي😢😢صعب
I've tried so many times. I always mess it up oh well I'll keep trying
Hi Donna, I just finished two of these and I didn't have any trouble.  I did use the plastic canvas to stiffen the cover and they turned out perfect, thank you for the video, now I'm a subscriber and am doing many of your patterns.
Can I get one hook? 😁 Beautiful crochet hook organizer.
Had a lot a fun making my case
this video is linked with a case that has a granny square pocket to hold scissors . is that a modified version ?
Very good very nice ☺☺ thank you 😘😘
Did you get written permission from the designer for this?
Wonderfull....too easy  and simple...I'll do it...thank you
Hi Donna I would like to make this hold 12 hooks if I make on extra pocket on each side it would work I also use the ergonomic hooks will I have to make the pockets different? Thanks I love your projects and tutorials
It is really beautiful and useful :).
Is there a pattern for ergonomic crochet needles? Thank you.

Oh com legendas muito bom!
Na hallo, vor lauter Übersetzungsstreifen sieht man rein garnichts. Das gab es Mal in Deutsch.
한국어도 지원 좀해주세요 ㅎㅎㅎ 잘보고가욤
Thank you for not using a background music!  Ahhh, so nice after suffering through several maddening, mind-numbing videos. Also, must tell you how much I appreciate your succinct and concise instruction. Thank you, thank you. You are a breath of fresh air...
Nastazia thank you is beatiful and the very useful thank you
Where do u find the plastic backing thing you used
Thanks for this video. I was able to make it a little bigger and put a zipper around the edges but used the button for a decoration. This was easier than I first thought. Thank you again😊😊😊
I'm on my way to do this pattern. You show it so clear. Greetings from Poland.
Very beautiful ... specail thanks... Madam
Hi, I made the book form one a year ago to put a set of bamboo hooks in to take on a plane with me, security will let you take the bamboo ones cause they're less dangerous, I also made a longer one that I could roll. They're a great use of scrap yarn too,
Thank you! very clear instructions! I will definitely make this!
Good job  Cg family
that is cool thank you so much angel...your amazing ...
I like you videos but do you do blo in first row? plz tell me so I can make it.
Just made me one, thank you for your easy to follow tutorial :)

Gracias...
Merci beaucoup pour le partage, je suis très contente. ( very glad, thank you very much)
I made it it’s so beautiful and easy to make thanks ❤️
A word of warning about crochet hook cases made of crochet hooks: your small crochet hooks may "disappear" inside the case 😂😂😂
beautiful case and most importantly really good, easy to understand directions.  Thanks!
شكرن على الترجمه 💐💐💐
Muchas gracias por este tutorial, explicas muy bien!
Can wait to start this.. Wht size hook did u use
Спасибо! Короткое и очень наглядное объяснение, доступное даже начинающему. Успехов вам и в дальнейшем!
Браво!!!!!
YEAH...HERE IT IS!!!
Row 2 is at 1:45 and Row 3 is at 4:20
Can't find the link natazia help please
I started to crochet when I was 7 years old!!No I am 11 and I realy enjoy your videos.I do my best to make all of them but we have and school right??
Hi. Thank for your videos happy. New. Year 2018
Thank you for the tutorial! Very easy to follow.
You made it look so easy to make. At the moment I don't have a lot of time to crochet anything because my 1 year old grandson is very demanding of my time. When he is a little older I will start doing some of the projects that I have saved. Thank you for the video.
This video is great  I'm Trying to figure out if i can make two pockets per row instead of one?
I love it thanks so much, my next project.
It's lovely 👌👌
Thank you I'm just about finished I added a other section to mine .
price
Does anyone have the written pattern for this? I went to priscillascrochet.net, but the site has been disabled.
Adorei!! Lindo!!
I’m 12 and I love to crochet I made this case for myself to keep all my 1267483 hooks lol
I just found your page and I am in love.  I've been crocheting for a while, so I love how your videos don't spend too much time in one area so I don't have to keep trying to fast forward, but you explain exactly what is needed.  Thank you so much!
hi im manjit from patiala punjab I'm a big big fan of yours. the way u teach its so easy I learnt many things and my kids so surprised to see me.thank u and keep sharing love u
Hi Naztazia love the crochet hook case but I need it in left hand, I tried follow right hand because my mom was right handed but I get misup along the way help and thank you
I'm probably not gonna do this, since I already have a crochet case, but this technique is so cool. I didn't know you could crochet pockets directly onto a work without sewing anything.
Loved that idea.
this is most imprssive thing
Row 2 - 1:44 Row 3 - 4:19
great!! i did it it`s my first work! sorry my english i`m from argentina
Thank you i just completed this tutorial! Recently learnt to crochet so i decided to buy a whole range of hooks! What better project to do with my new hooks!! This case is so cute! (I decided to do mine in yellow! Also adding a frog fastener) Thank youu so much!!
How can I add in another sleeve?
This is soooo lovely - is there a tutorial anywhere for the larger handle (non metal) hooks please? X
I really like this!
Is there any chance of providing a readable version?  Just because I think you did something a bit differently from Miss Priscilla instructions.  Thanx!
Merci pour vos tutoriels... Vous êtes très claire et vos créations sont très bien choisi et réalisés.  Thanks for all your videos... You are really easy to understand and your creations are great and Well done (i hope my english is correct)
Very nice, love this tutorial.🌷
I just finished making this and I'm super happy with it 😊 Thank you so much for this video!
I am Marie from Corfu Greece and I am 81 years old , your videos is a companio for me because I make many things with your direction. Thank you for this Crochet Hook Case Holder Folder Wallet, it is very useful and i make it as a present
I finished my crochet hook cover. I love it. Thank you for showing me that I can do new things. I am so amazed and thankful.
Me gusta mucho muy bien explicado y pude hacerlo!! Muchas gracias ya tengo  estuche para mis agujas...Bendiciones!!
about how long is this case
You will learn English so I can communicate with you. Thank you for the translation of Arabic and your efforts, and to resolve it to a million subscribers
Got it
I've been Crocheting since I was a young girl, and I'm still learning and trying new stitches.
very nice
great tutorial.
ok tks
Thank you so much
Why are different needle sizes used for the  same yarn or wool
That is just simply beauitiful i love it
Loved it!!!!
What kind of yarn did you use?
In row 4, I found the hole on the other side, am I doing it wrong?
Muito obrigada. Beijos
Muy  Bien.   Práctico y util
that is really cute.
وشكراً لك على ترجمة الفيديو

I love this case as with all of you videos it was you that taught me to crochet you videos are clear easy to follow and very well presented I  would like to know if this can be adapted to accommodate knitting needles would love to make it for my mum she is right into knitting
thanks
bravissima molto bello questo video con i sottotitoli peccato che non sono per tutti io non sono principiante  però molte volte non riesco a capire certi passaggi  grazie 😚
Can you do a tutorial on zipper closure?
Absolutely Amazing.... Cant wait to start making one (actually I'll need 2) for my set of crochet hooks!!
I'm 10 years old and I made one for my self and my grandma in 2 weeks o
This is so flippin' cool!!  None of the crochet hook cases in the store have what I want or need.  This way, I can make it to my specifications :)
I followed what u was doing then when u get part say roll four repeat roll 2 I like huh would be good if u did second one before u letting people go do it your self :( I give this thumb down because I couldn't do next pocket because u didn't show me how done because it look tricky
สวยๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆมากนะคะ
I actually made one and used same color, and lm very much happy for result, l gifted it to myself 😎 , thanks a lot for the video 😇
i love all your video's !!! you explain so a beginner can do it( I'm a beginner ) thanks for all the things you post !!! keep posting, always wanting to learn more ;)
I didn't put in the Plastic mesh but rolled it and crocheted 2 ties to close the roll...also made it a bit wider to hold 2 more hooks on each side.  love it and it works up quickly:)
gracias por compartir tus trabajos muy bonito el estuche saludos desde España
Felicidades  hermosisimo
wondering if it would work well if i made the spine larger and added a third section?
I love it. I llove how you showed how to hold steel needles. Thanks so much.
Thank you!!! I will try to make it... now I will know where my hooks are this is awesome!! : )
You are so talented!!!! Thank you very much for sharing. You are amazing teacher.
it's fantastic, really I've been searching to bought one like that but i can't found anything like that, and then i found ur fantastic and helpful video. :) :) thank u soooo much . <3
great tutorial!!  😊😊😊 Thanx
Hi there. How many stitches do i need for tunesian needles  (30cm. long).
I love your video, your and excellent instructor, I downloaded the pattern and plan to make the case.
Very nice case.
حلو
Really great job
Japanese links please
Best crochet case tutorial and pattern! I added some plastic vinyl from an old notebook  (5 star notebook) to give extra durability. This was so fun and easy! Haha, just realized I'm on my hubby's phone **SewCurlyAngel aka Stephanie Jevyak**
I try to make it, and its too small... I think I did something wrong... >.<
I made this holder this weekend for my mom.  You are one of the best instructors I have ever listened to since starting to crochet!  You are amazing and and thank you so much for sharing.
I have been crocheting for one month now and I made this case in one day I love it wish I could have posted a pic but I don't know how lol.  I love your instructions happy creating😃
Donna, this is awesome. Priscilla is a genius! I am a tropical child, so although I learned to knit at a young age I took crochet and ran with it until I came here to live. Then a few years ago I started to knit again, and now I am in the mood to do both. I can't wait to make both cases. I just have to get my hook set and decide what yarn to use. Maybe I will do it in linen. Here is the link for the Afghan/C Hook/Knitting Roll-up case. http://priscillascrochet.net/free%20patterns/Needleworkers/Afghan%20Hooks,%20Cro-Hooks%20or%20Knitting%20Needle%20Roll.pdf
Hi, I just love your videos and thank you for this wow project!
Puedo traducir el patrón al español y ponerlo en mi blog? Gracias!
Hey I heard you like crochet so I made you a crochet pattern for your crochet hooks so you can crochet some crochet for your crochet
Мне  очень  понравился органайзер. Спасибо  за мастер  класс.
gracias me quedo muy Bonito
pro favor vc post  divulgar o menu canal.
Gracias por los subtitulos en Español,  me gustaría que todos sus tutoriales tuvieran los subtitulos en Español, gracias ♥
is this for left handed people coz I just can't seem to get the pivot bit right lol x please help. somewhat a beginner x
Thank You So Much
I started making this.  Although I loved it, it did not fit my ergonomic crochet hooks.  I will try again making the pockets wider.
I just finished my case and want to show you the pics 😃
Muchas gracias por la traducción a español gracias a eso ya pude hacer mi estuche para crochet y me quedo hermoso 😁😮
Super tutorial😀! Thank You very very much 😀!
i like so much...it is very nice!!
even though this looks nicer, if you wanted to, you could just crochet the pockets right? i mean you don't have to have the outer case or? i could imagine only making the pockets and then use this as one of those cases you roll up and close with strings. you know what i mean?
Thank you so much 😃😃😃
I LOVE YOUR VIDEO
omg ive seen this on pintrest!!! is this pattern copy righted. I'd like to make some and sell them for extra money. please let me know. thank you.
Need to do written directions
الكروشيه فن راقي ورائع وفيه قمة الابداع فقط بسنارة وصوف
lovely tutorial! Thank you!
Will this case fit ergonomic hooks?
Can you use foam instead of the plastic canvas for the insert?
Beautifull. Bellissimo! mi  piace lo faro. Saluti della ' Italia.👍
Very nice! Thank you so much
I finished my first crochet hook case and looks great.  Thanks for the tutorial.
Love this! So creative! 😍
thank you very good amaizing work
Love it.  Excellent tutorial video.
Thank you so much for this tutorial, I have almost 50 hooks and I am making my hook book twice this size. when I am done I will do a "Check this out" video and tag you in it. I love this so much. Thanks again ;)
This is amazing!😍😍
Thank you for sharing this video!! I've been trying to make an organizer and the pattern I had was too difficult.  I'm subscribing now!!
hi there, I started this project and i have gotten to the 4th row and i have already done one of the hook pockets and i am very confused how to make the other pockets? i got the first pocket but how do you make the other ones after that?
can you do a tutorial bikini with good coverage for the bottom part
I made this case and I love it. It holds so many hooks from small ones to large ones.
Please help. I can not find this pattern.
Hello I can not find the pattern for this that you are making
me encantó quisiera realizarlo podrías ponerlo en español por favor gracias saludos desde Mexicali baja California
Thank you so much for this video!
Forgot to mention that I like your tutorials.
Can you help me with a link that sell the leather bottoms for the crochet bags. I don't know the right terminology to put in the search engine, on Amazon or Ebay.
I just completed the case, i used a large hook and it's big and nice.
Without sounding tacky...This is perfect for using old yarn that has gotten stiff. It makes this very sturdy. I'm loving this!
awesome!!
OMG!! I need this! Love it!
شكرا لكي على الترجمة 😙😙😙
what type of thread you are using?
I just finished making this! :D
Instead of using the canvas, I stuffed the the hook holder and it worked well
I love you

oh wow! this looks super awesome!!! i must make also one!!! i have one in PU leather, but this is soooo much prettier!!! but soooo much!!! 😍😍😍
Thank you so much for this video!! I made this exact same case years ago in light lavender & baby blue in sport weight yarn, doubled up. I thought I would never see this again.
👍👍👍👍👍😊
I've already done the crochet hook (in two days so easy it is), and planning to do your broomstick scarf. Love your channel! Thank you very much!!
gracias por el tutorial y los subtítulos 😘
that's beautiful!  I'm so pleased to have discovered your channel.  I already have two projects on my to-do list!
Also, does the subtitles trick work for all videos or just yours?
Hi, I was wondering if the pockets would accommodate a 10mm hook? If not, could you make the pockets bigger, maybe with a treble crochet instead of a double, or would that mess up the pattern?
Hola. me. gusta. su. canal
ima try two different colors red and grey....
I'm glad you made this video and explained the steps so clearly. Now I have my own case and I feel pretty accomplished. Thank you!
Thank you, I just finished mine...
Excellent explanation, thank you very much for sharing the video.
Whats the best yarn and hook size you can use for this crochet hook case?
I don't speak english,im sorry
buenas noches Saludos desde Puerto Rico .podria hacer nuevamente la funda o cartuchera tejida CRIS paso a paso  pf  .muchas gracias
Hello Nastasia can u plz tell me how i can make the Pocketcase  bigger bcz  the Hooks is bigger...plz tell me how i can make this... thanks :)
it was really awsome thanks for you putting it on YouTube 😄
Thank you so much for sharing this video. Works great and video instructions  are  so easy to follow. Now I have a pouch for all my needles. Husband was loved how it turned out  also. Thank you again
Thank you for the video and your time for showing this. I'm going to try to crochet this. I need one for my crochet hooks. Thanks again
Thank you. I currently have two cases that I purchased but that's still not enough to hold all my crochet needles. This will be a huge assist. Thank you!
I needed a hook case and your tutorial helped me sooo much!!!!!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
You are very talented!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
This was really a great vid even for a beginner! I have been crocheting for a long time but don't know how to read a pattern so vids like this are great. Never had a mom or grandma who knew how so I have picked up how tos along the way. Thanks for having a channel like this, it's been very easy to follow the instructions.
peu tu le  dire en frencais
Hello Naztasia, What are yours crochets ? I am in France, I can buy similares on websites if you have one to recommand me !   Thank you for tutorials, they are very clear, even if I don't speak english very well !
omg this is awsome
fantastic work ... thank you
Ciao! Sto provando a farlo, ma ho difficoltà a capire come unisci nel giro 4 le due metà lavorare in costa. Spero tu mi possa aiutare, grazie e complimenti per i tuoi lavori💛💕
When I did this pattern I added one more pocket on each side. I love this, and it's better than having them thrown in a box, lol
Hello very nicely. I'll try to do it. Thanks
thank you very much
very very beautiful thank you so much😘
can you make a video about how to do hair
I'm loving it. Thank you very much.
thanks for the tutorials I love them they teach me a lot of stuff about crocheting
Огромная благодарность за урок, все очень доступно и понятно, даже без английского языка
I really appreciate your tutorial. You talk clearly, it is easy to follow instruction. English is NOT my first language and I had no problem to understand each steps. Thank you.
I love it
your welcome.🙋
very very pretty thanks
beurifull thanks i live in mexico squesme my english
At row 29, the cross stitches, I keep having 31/32 stitches in total at the end. Am I doing something wrong? I love the pattern. Hope to hear an answer soon! x
I Loved the crochet.😴😴
wow, very cool
how much yarn did you use in all
Saludos desde Puerto Rico. estaba buscando un tutori para guardar mis ganchillos. y vi su tutorial. Lo estoy haciendo paso paso segun el video. Está hermoso..
Really handy now I can orgonize my stuff.... thanks so much... Can you please  explain us how to knit a case for sticks... :)
thank you!
Beautiful
Quero comprar agulha grande de croche...mas não encontro no Brasil...vc pode me indicar site de compras ou enviar para minha esposa  Obrigado...
that was such an awesome tutorial....can't wait too make one....thank you
So handy ....thank you ...love from Holland..😘
Hi there, I absolutely adore this pattern and have managed to put together my first crochet project from start to finish! Slight snag though, I now realise I could do with more room, would you have any ideas on how to make an extension for this, maybe a way to add a central flap? I was thinking of adding one using the 'spine' do you think this will work even though I have finished the case already? :)
adorei
realy i like it so much
I love this one, it was so easy to folie the tutorial here.  But I Wonder, do you have a diagram to download instead of text tutorial?   Many hugs from Linda in Sweden
This is a beautiful case and I'm going to make this but,  when I was doing row 4, (which was repeating row 2) it would make the hook pocket on the OTHER side of the first pocket you did.  I read the pattern,  and got confused again. I'm not very good with patterns so I like watching the video tutorials.  You do an excellent job slowly explaining but for some reason mine didn't come out as perfectly as yours did! If anyone knows how are why this happened to me, do please tell me!  Thank you!
deberías de tratar de que los letreros en español estén un poco afuera de la toma de el tejido por que uno no lo puede a preciar mucho pero esta muy bien el vídeo sip
Thanks I have made one of my own from watching it
very beautiful
I love it 👍🏼
buen canal pero no lo puedes traducir al español?
Very. Nice
جميلة اتمنى ان تترجم للعربية
Thank You Awesome instructions.!
I love this! Thank you, and I love your videos!
Hi Donna! Thank you so much for this tutorial, very clear and helpful!
Donna, thank you so much for your tutorial.  I am new to crocheting, and would have been stuck at several points following the written instructions. Watching your video made it so much easier for me to follow. I am very excited to watch other videos of yours.
salu c'est trop beau mais j'ai rien comris
Thank you so much I had the pattern and was very confused with the hook slots this helped clear it up so much and now I am excited I can make one.  I was about to file the pattern to maybe do it later but now I'm working it no problem will have it done tomorrow :)
I apologize if this questions has already been answered. In Row 28 you SC in the back loops only and place a stitch marker. Do you do something with this row later? I have looked several times and don't see a reference to it again. This row is basically where it changes from the inside to the outside. Row 29 is where the cross DC starts. Thank you for the video and any help here!
wow they look great .....
I really love this version since you are making the hook "pockets" as you go.  I will attempt this with maybe DC to be able to fit my Tulip hooks.  If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear 'em.  Thanks! :-)
This is the first crochet project I have completed.. minus a simple rose and a couple single chain bracelets. Just picked it up and started. I appreciate your video!! I am making them for all the mothers in my family!
this is so beautiful thanks a lot for the pattern
Very pretty , thanks
very very beautiful and useful, thanks
thank you and btw i you do an amazing job with videos
When I get to row 4, I only have 18 stitches to do the dc's on the back loop. What am I doing wrong?
it came out rather nice but little bulky
si les explications  était  en français sa serait  bien mieux   merci
The first time I watched this, thought oh too complicated. Second time watching it became clear and I will be making one.  Thanks for posting this.
Love my new little case! Thanks for the awesome tutorial! Happy crocheting from Dallas, Texas!
I love your tutorias. I'm trying to find one on how to make a Dallas cowboys blanket for the back seat of a can do mabey baby blanket size. Do you know where I can find one or can you do one 😆please
Awesome work!!!
i absolutely love this pattern, but for me there is not enough openings for the hooks i have so i am making a few alterations without making it an wider then what it currently is. so i will post a link if anyone wants to use the alterations i am doing as well.
merci pour cette vidéo  je viens de finir le mien il est très beau bravo pour tout ce que vous faites
I  am making this after I make a spring basket. :-)
For what ever reason I am getting stuck from ros 2-3-4-2-3-4 Suggestions???
Where did you get your stich markers?
You are awesome
How to make pockets larger?
Excelente presentacion. Yo no entiendo nada de ingles. La traduccion no es buena y aun asi lo logre ya que se miran muy bien las puntadas. Gracias. Saludos.
This pattern is the best I have seen yet! Your technique and explanations are quite understandable and doa le.  Thank you so much.
i like your idea
great video!!!!!!!!!! great instructions!!!!!!!! THANK YOU !!!!
I would not have been able to complete this handy dandy case without your video. I like the concept of having something I've made to keep my hooks in, and loved the pattern but it seemed overly confusing until I got the visual aspect! Thanks so much!
i keep stitching into the ch 2. am i supposed to just skip it? or isn't it supposed to count as the first dc?
this turned out beautifully !!!! I'm a bit more advanced than the beginner level and definitely going to try this. I can follow videos on how to do things but for the life of me I can't read a crochet pattern haha 😕...thank you for posting this! 👍👍

DYI crochet case I can't wait to make that!!! great instructions 🙆
thank you Donna wolf for all your video I am a beginner in crochet hook but I am making a lot of things like berets sorry I can't speak English very good but I like you very much I am from Algeria and in the end I hope said in Arabic بارك الله فيك يا اختي و ربنا يهديكي إنشاء الله والصلاة والسلام على سيدنا محمد
This looks incredible! Now, I'm only on about my 4th day of crocheting, but I am determined to make this my first "more advanced"'project. Your tutorial makes it look easy enough - after I feel comfortable with my double crochets I think I'll be ready to try this!
absolutely beautiful, and thanks for making it such an simple tutorial!
Miss Donna Wolfe, you are an excellent crochet teacher!   Thank you.
You make a very clear video. No one will ever get wrong following you along. Thanks for your help.
awesome pattern, very easy to follow video, got the pattern down and ready to go on my own.  thanks
Hola  Ana  y si no le pongo la maya en medio  y lo ago para acer un rótulo kedara bien. Gracias
Espectacular!! me suscribo :)
Me gusta mucho
Excellent... Am really enjoying your videos... Can we do the same pattern for something different like a handbag organizer with pockets for phone, small notebook , lipstick... Etc i hope you make a video for something like that... Have a good day
Hi, thank you for taking the time to teach us. I love it !!! I have a doubt, I did 31 chains to start with but now when I count my DC stitches I have 32. What did I do wrong and does the turning chain of 2 count as the first DC? I would appreciate a reply from anyone who wants to help me. Thanks again
fantastic .. I made one of this, It's so cool . thank you
Hello Donna,   It's been years since I actually crocheted and when I saw this, as complicated as it looks,  I was determine. LOL.  Thanks for uploading.  I did it.  :-)
كتييييييييير حلوة  انا جاي على بالي اعملها بس انا ما بعرف
Hi there, I've been looking for the written pattern for this and I cannot find it on the website you provided! Can you help me
Thanks from all my heart
Good Afternoon I am unable to locate this pattern on the website. thank you
Muy bueno!
I can't get straight edged any tips? thnx
Hi. I love your tutorial for this. It's very easy to follow. I'm just wondering how to make the pockets a bit larger for the ergonomic hooks. Thanks in advance for any help on this :)
Love the crochet hook. Happy new 2016.
I noticed you chained 2 and went into the same stitch for the double crochet of row 2 when you started.  That makes an increase in your pattern for some people. If you just count it as a Double crochet it will not leave a hole. I have been using the chain 2 for the beginning double crochet for years and have been crocheting for 50 years. I hope this helps.
me encanta el porta agujas de crochet
Hello Naztazia, i am happy witch you words, but will be possibel subtitulos in spanish, thanks eva
Love the crochet case, I am trying to make it for a gift, but my friend uses the Ergonomics crochet hooks so the slots need to be almost twice the size. Can I do a treble crochet stitch or larger to be able to slide those in the slot???? I sure would like to make this and would make such a nice gift.... The directions are so clear as I am still learning crocheting....
I absolutely LOVE this! So easy, quick and fun to make. Super easy to personalize. I think I'll make a few more just because. Lol Thanks for sharing. 💜
I am truly LOVING your tutorials.  I've known the crochet basics for about 20 years and only recently started reading patterns and following tutorials.  All of yours are explained so well and showed so intricately that even a beginner can follow along easily!  Thanks for another great tutorial!!!
Español
Спасибо огромное!!! Супер задумка!!! Вяжу себе тоже такой кошелечек для крючков, все очень доступно поясняете стараясь чтоб у людей тоже получилась такая красота.

thanks for sharing~<3
i loved this and when followed step by step it felt sooo easy, thank you so much x
Love the video it was easy to follow. I'm a beginner and would like to learn more of the basic stitches and how to read and follow written instructions and patterns on the crocheting books.
thanks
Naztazia, ,¿cómo se traduce al español. Estoy en Argentina y deseo entender tus enseñanzas, ¡por favor ayudame !, Tus trabajos son hermosos. Gracias. Magda
I've tried this an love it :) thanks so much for making it easy, reading the pattern isn't always straight forward so watching you really helped
I love this pattern! It is super easy and works up beautifully! My only question is could it be modified to fit the ergonomic crochet hooks?
hola, no me aparece la opcion para subtitulos
beautiful. thank you.
que lastima que no lo expliques en español .Asi no me entero de nada y me gustaria hacerlo para mis ganchillos. .Un beso desde España.
Very well done on this video, you are well spoken and make this pattern easy to follow.  thank you
WOW!!!
amazing project thank you very much I love it
what is the easiest way to  learn this if I am a beginner?
Okay, I made this and it turned out great. Now, I need one for my knitting needles. Can this pattern be used for that and add more stitches or is there a separate pattern altogether? I've searched youTube and couldn't find a pattern.
very nice tutorial. I checked out your free patterns, and for some reason when I clicked on the free iBook link I got a file not found error. Anyways, nice collection of patterns.
wow I love it is very beautiful thank you for the tutorial
This pattern is genius.
Hi not aviable or not working subtitles in spanish. Thank you almost not undersand your tutorial.
thank you very very much
Hermoso!!!
Thank you dear
Gracias!!! desde Ecuador...eres genial!!!
If I use a bigger hook will it make the hook holes bigger? My hooks are covered in polymer clay.
Hi Naztazia beautiful work!  Let me ask you something, I have a nice set of hooks from Furls, they are big (width) how can I adjust the pattern?
Wow! It's beautiful
bravo muy bonito trabajo ,, nice
sus vídeos se podrán tradusir en español x q vivo en México y todo es muy interesantedemasiado bonito pero casi no lo entiendo muchas gracias y muchas felisidades por su página
thanks for the tutorial, it helped a lot
I used Bulky 5 yarn with a size 6.0 hook, I down sized the pattern in the video to 21 chain stitch starting off, then for the pockets I made them 15 stitchs and the dc above them 5 stitchs for anyone wondering how to shorten the pattern with bigger yarn and hooks. It comes out to the same size in the pattern you always want to do this in multiples of 10 or it off sets the pattern.   P.S. sorry if this is long to read. By the way this is a beautiful case.
I love your crafts i'm only 11 so it's kinda hard for me to do some of them but I always figer it out. And um if you can I really need more easer crafts to do but with still using everything just a little easer do u think u might be able to do that. please and thankyou
Çok güzel oldu, çok beğendim
Lavoro molto bello, sei bravissima. Finalmente i miei uncinetti saranno sempre in ordine., Grazie
hagan uno traducido al español
Hello :) First off I'd like to thank you for this video, this is just what I want for my hooks. I tried making it but as my hooks have grips on them (Clover, Knitpro and such) they wont fit in the pockets. Do you have a suggestion to alter the pockets to fit these types of hooks or would that require to change the entire pattern? Best regards Carina
This is absolutely amazing! Thank you for the tutorial 💕
ماشاء الله عليكي
Yo quiero hacerlo pero no entiendo en Inglés 😢
Thank you so much !!!!! Really nice video and so easy to make because of the excellent explanation !!!!!!!

I learned how to crochet from waching you and Melanie ham
ciao Naz. , sei bravissima, peccato che ci metto tanto a seguire i tuoi lavori ma sono davvero belli, specialmente la bustina poertauncinetti.. vorrei chiedere se potresti fare un bustina per le tessere. Grazie e complimenti per i tuoi lavori
Naztazia, I love this, I cant wait to try it. I do have one question, do you have ANY problems with the hooks slipping out through the stitching??
oi tudo bem gostei da sua aulas
great gift idea
I was on my 5th pocket and I realized that my stitches were decreasing as I went. I was avoiding this pattern because it looked complicated but now that I've tried its easier than I thought. Thx so much I love your videos!!
Pleas slowy ok
I can't change the idiome please i don't understand it! Thankyou very much!!!
hola anaztazia, soy de chile...te escribo porque me encató tu trabajo y lo hice pero me gustaría saber si puedes hacer un neceser de maquillaje te lo agradecería...besitos.
hai can u tel me how to make a wider pocket
Hi Naztazia , i like you crochet thing.
hi!! i'm ellen from greece! i'm 12 years old and i lerned how to crochet with your videos! thanks a log!!!
Thank you
excellent tutorial!
i didn't make 2 sides.  so I'm confused on how to do the covert now
I love this it was very simple to make, I added to mine to put more crocheting hooks in it, like the bigger hooks P, Q, etc, with bigger pockets so they'll fit inside of them, Thank you for this turtorial
واووووووووو  ثس از ﺍﻣﻴﺰﻥ
hermosisimo, felicidades
Hey!!  Did 1yarn it's enough for this hook case?? Thank you :)
Soo nice. Thanks.
naztazia thanks
@Mychaela T - Hello! thanks for the kindness. You can certainly modify the pattern to your liking, but because it's an intermediate pattern, it's not very easy to explain in the space YT gives us here. In general if I was to do what you suggest, I would do my right-hand side and center section as the video suggests. Then I would continue by crocheting a rectangular piece equivalent to the size of the right-hand side using double crochet. Then I would go back to the center, reconnect the yarn, and crochet another rectangle, same width, but slightly smaller height, to serve as the pocket. These 2 rectangles should replace the left-hand pockets. Sew the top rectangle to the bottom rectangle as needed. Then I would follow the rest of the pattern as is to crochet the outside cover. :)
thank you, great tutorial have to make abot 3, Love it.
Hello Ms. Donna,   I would first like to thank you for your quality video and having a left handed section. I wanted to ask you a question about the crochet needle holder. I would to modify this pattern with one side the fairly large pocket (to hold my cross stitch pattern and other stuff for that)then, the other side for crochet needles (like the video). I have just started my craft and have picked up many things fairly easy in the last month or so. Your help would be greatly appreciated.   Best regards,  Mychaela Harris   P.S. Do you think you can make a video about deciphering crochet pattern that are beginners/intermediate?
Great tutorial I'm going to make one later on today.
Very clear tutorial, thanks! I'm trying to work out in my head how to add or connect some flat panels/pockets inside for crochet hook cords. I know it will be easy, but do you think it would add too much bulk? I'd probably need to make the button loop slightly longer to account for them right?
@anastasia filewood - thank you very much!
szkoda ze nie pokazuje pani jak zrobi to cale bo ja języka nie znam
Me Gustaría Que fuera En Español No se mucho Inglés
Dear, Naztazia. Thank you very much for your tutorial. Girl, you was born to crochet and we love your classes!!! I did my crochet hook case and it is amazing! Good bye the mess of my hooks!! Now i would like to use the same idea to make a cutlery case, because i need to take it to my job for lunch time. Do you know how can i make larger pockets? Can you teach us, please? Thank you! Hugs.
Very nice!
This is so cool I can't wait to make it
Pretty cool
Thank you very much for this video..I just finished one for me..exactly as you said...very nice and clear to understand. .looking forward for sone more..
owow  very neat..
@neelam ram The written pattern is on Ms. Priscilla's website if that helps: http://priscillascrochet.net/
Just finished one of these...thanks so much! Turned out great! :)
Hello Naztazia , i just learn Crochet Hook Case more understand and also can you give me crochet hook case holder symbol please thanks
Nice idea.  You mentioned the CC option in the beginning, but I don't see that option on my screen. Is that only available to certain people? Thanks for showing the video.
It's amazing!! Thank you so much for this super video.
It is still a beautiful pattern
Thanks for the help! The only thing that i have a problem with is that the pockets are super long...
Thank you so much for the lovely video.. it came out very well :))
This is great.  I made something similar but not as big....dee
Hey naztazia !! I was just wondering how many skeins of yarn you used on this project? I was going to start on it but wasn't sure how much material was needed? Great vid!!!!
Thank you so much for this tutorial! It helped me so much and I made the case and it turned out great! :-) :-) I used variegated yarn and it looks fabulous! Its a great place to store all my crochet hooks!  Ty so much Donna!
Fantastic tutorial.
I just finished my crochet hook holder and I am so proud of how it turned out! Thank you lots for your clear instructions. ☺
chciałam zrobić ale nie zdążam bo za szybko pani robi
Wow! Really beautiful! Great and very clear instructions. Thank you.
How long did it take
Hermoso amiguita. .
Hi I enjoyed your video on how to crochet hook case holder folder wallet storage for hooks. I'm trying to make one for myself but I'm stuck on making the second pocket can you explain to me how you did it ? I'm a little confused. Keep up the good work, may God continue to bless you and keep you! (:
Thank you v much
Hi confused on hook size I'm I the UK are they 3.75mm and 4.25 please ty . I want to make some as gifts
Im still a beginer but i love it. As i follow all the time, practice makes perfect!!
Me gusta mucho el porta ganchos pero no se ingles lo pueden subir a español
This is my first try at any thing I do what you say but my work don't look what you have done why is that?  I'm going to try it once again where you say count to 10 first and then going on to 20 do you charge your stitch or keep it the same only it's in the back loop. I think that s  how I missed up. It's wide ed at the top than at the bottom.
Awesome video I want to make this for my mother in law and my grandmother do you think the Japanese hooks would fit the pockets? My grandma has bad authritis and can't do the usual hooks.
what size crochet hook did you use??
OMG you are amazing, I don't understand english perfect, but you speak so clear and explain very very well. Thank you so much.
Totally making this one, Thank you so much for posting the video. You would not have a recipe on how to make a knitting needle case? circular and straight ones.
+Naztazia can I change the color of the working yarn?
Beautiful case -- thanks for the tute!
naztazia hi, from where did u buy the canvas u have used to crochet the hook case??. Thank you ;)
Hi, I would like to ask u from where  did u buy the canvas you have used for the crochet hook case. Thank you;)
Thanks so much easy to follow!
Totally got lost on the 2nd row of hook holders I watched and rewatched and I still didn't see how you got the 2nd row - it went straight to the cover... What should I do???
how can you make the pocket bigger for the hooks that have the rubber around them im trying to make a bigger pocket
Hi naztazia, i would like to ask, is that alright if i use hook size 4/E (3.50 mm) to do this project?
do u have a pattern written down
Thank you for the video. I finished mine and turn out great!
Brilliant im going to make one  thank you
your videos are amazing !!!!
Cool  I like watching your video
I'm from chile and no subtitles appear I do not know how :(
naztazia thank you for doing such a great tute on this!! i fell in love with Mrs. Hewitt's  pattern but being a newbie, didnt think i could do it just by reading the pattern! this is a definite life savor in understanding how it goes together!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH :)
I love it! Working on mines right now, I love the idea of adding more hooks, as I have tons. Takes up alot of yarn but it's a cozy little case for all my hooks.
I liked
.Thank You naztazia ! I made it, where can I send you a picture?
I really like this, can you use cardboard instead of the plastic?
I wish I'd found this tutorial before I did this project. Mine came out well but a lot of mistakes made---I will be making another thanks to your tutorial and minimize errors :)
I was wondering how would I do if I wanted to have a diffren color inside from out side where would I stop the inner color and begun the outer one?????
Hi, how r u?. I'm making u're patter for the crochet hook. It took me 2 times to make I'm almost  done. Very easy pattern just started back crocheting last year. Thank you
tried many times and always didn't get it right.  after many times I realized      THE IMPORTANCE OF COUNTING YOUR STITCHES with this pattern at all times.  Count your twenty when you   join the pocket, and when you single crochet the back of them.  Count every time y ou   make a pocket......So Important!!!   Now I'm on my way to a perfect, or nearly perfect case!!!! I"m using    Super  Saver Aran  Fleck for the innside and       Super Saver   Buff  Flect for the outside.   It's gonna be so great when I finally get this right!!!! Stich Markers are a must......   later,
Wow!!  And I do mean wow!  What an excellent teaching video. I'm sure you did Mrs. Hewitt proud.  Thank you so much. I can't wait to try this pattern.
merci beaucoup naztazia.... j'aime bien vos travaux a bientot
How do I get printable directions?  Your videos are great.  Thank you
I Loved the hook case so much and now I won't lose my hooks Thank You Naztazia
Where can I find a link to written instructions?
Hi Love this I made 2 and a begginer can you tell me what i would have to do to make the pockets a little wider?
I am working on this.  I miscounted my stitches, so the pockets are not even in length.  I could have taken it out and started over, but I decided not to.  I love working on this, mistakes and all.  The pattern was probably beyond my beginner level, but I wanted to try it.  Thank you so much for the video!
HOLA ME GUSTARIA VER TODOS TUS VIDEOS EN ESPAÑOL NO SE QUE HACER
Do the pockets in this fit clover Amor hooks? Thanks.
I just made this I'm a beginner and it was perfect thank you
I can not find the pattern for the crocheted hook case.
Thank you for sharing this :)
I love ur best tutorial ur v best teacher
hi,on one of your other hook case designs(I believe it is on you webpage.its the pink one) your counting is waaaay off. my wife was wondering if you could please elaborate on why.thankyou kindly :)
Are the crochet terms in American version or a UK version?
is there any other designs for crochet cases that looks pretty and not plan
TFS this hook case is one of the prettiest case I have seen and its so easy to follow your instructions. Going to crochet a few for all my hooks.
This is really difficult :( I get lost at the 'turn clockwise…'
Hello naztazia you are making really good works, i love them! I'm congratulating you. Love you so much! I try to make your works too. Nice to meet you! Love from Turkiye :) <3
I really enjoyed this tutorial...there was a couple places I was a little confused, but I am a relearner..Thank you so much for sharing.
Donna, that is a FANTASTIC tutorial!  thank you for doing this!
Thank you for this. Is it possible to make the pockets bigger for hooks with grips on them?
Thank you so much i have been waiting for this tutorial for a couple of months
oh, I'm sooo excited about this video, cannot wait to start this! thank you, I really enjoy your tutorials!
wheny you do the first single crochet will it be skinny
thank you so much for sharing this tutorial..
@izzy s - thank you for your kindness!
I love your work it comes out so perfect. thanks
Hello. I have been waiting for this video ever since I saw the picture on your website. I am almost done with mine but I have a question. In the video, there are 3 different stitch markers. But nothing was said about the last one. Am I missing something? It's on row 28 right before you start the back cover. I'm almost done and those front loops stick out now. I think I've done something wrong. Help! Thanks!
I always wanted to do this project, but did not understand the directions.. thank you for making the youtube video,, it is so much easier now
nice, thank you,
Thank you so much for this tutorial dear!!!
Saw your video earlier today. Went out and got my yarn. This is such a cool idea. In January, I started teaching Dec Arts in High School. I've got 34 students, so I've also got lots of crochet hooks. I was keeping them in a plastic case, but this is soooo much better!!! 5 weeks ago the kids couldn't crochet, now they are making lace doilies. Their final project will be to choose their own project. I'm going to offer this as one of their options. Thank you Naztazia!!!
@Donna Dodd - thank you so much for all of your kindness! :)
Love the case! I've been looking for one that I actually like and want to try. I will be starting it tonight :) One question though, what is the biggest size crochet hook that will fit in one of the pockets?
Please call me @ 210-388-1490. In reference to crochet case holder. I would appreciate your call
Thank you so much for your tutorials!  I am a left handed newbie (who has been trying to learn to crochet for many years).  My very first finished project was the dishcloth - also using your tutorial.  I was so excited with my success I made 8 dishcloths!  This will be my second completed project.  The only place in the pattern I struggled with was pivoting to create the hook pockets.  Once I figured out I needed to pivot counter clockwise it went perfectly.  I know I will be making several of these to give as gifts to the other crocheters in my family!  Thank you again - you are an excellent teacher and I look forward to completing many more projects with you!
I loved your tutorial  my hook case came out amazing  thank you so much
@Marilyn Figueroa Thank you so much!
@Emily O - you can find other purses/cases in a playlist on my channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Wznh_zZEy9NPB9tfBdT448_XBCamp66
Can you maybe make a little purse please
Muy bueno!!!
Que chulo AMIGA
Awsome
Hi Naztazia lovely pattern and look good thank you Ramya.
Thank you for sharing, this is my next project.  Easy to follow, great instructions,  thanks again
Would you be able to teach us how to crochet the fingerless gloves we see in the intro please? They look really nice and want to make a pair. :)
I just finished this today.. I did not put plastic canvas in mine simply  because I am just to lazy to go to the store and get it and I was eager to finish... I love it! Thanks so much for the video!!! You are an awesome teacher! :-)
Thank you for the tutorial.  I've had the pattern for a while and never tried making it until now.  I love it!  I just might make another.  Thank you again.
thank you for this gorgeous work and your easy explain
شكراا لك مجهود رائع وشرح سهل
+Huong Tran thank you so very much!
Awesome case 👏👍 Thank you for sharing 😊 Definitely a winner 🏆
Thank you so much!!!
This is really really cool.  I am excited to make one of these.  Do you have any designs that would hold circular knitting needles?
Donna thank you so much for this video! I kinda understood the written pattern, but to see you do it made it so much simpler!
Thank you
Beautiful. Useful. Well explained.
Gracias thank you beautifull
Thank you for doing this video I have been wanting to do this pattern for some time now.
I love this! Thanks so much!!!!
Yay! Now I don't have to continue using an old makeup case for my hooks! I'm sure I could extend the length to make room for my knitting needles as well. Thank you!
I love this pattern.  Thank you so much for the tutorial.
This is AWESOME!!!!  Thank you so much for sharing and I love your style...not so slow I'm agonizing to speed things up, but at a pace where I can definitely follow along!  Love this going to start mine tonight!!
Love this! I definitely need to make one. I have hooks all over the house.
I request this thanks so much for making it!
I was HOPING there'd be a video for this!  I wanted to make this!
BRAVISSIMA, CIAO!
