Giant cookie with whipped cream
That cream is too liquidnto hold the cookies, sus
Its a dream Come True
“Soft brown sugar” PLONK !
Can I leave in the refrigerator and then bake??
Looked amazing without the small cookie topping.
😁😁😁😁😁
OMG - this is killing me!!!  Why did I give up sugar!?!? haha
Jemma, you are such an inspiration! If making a day in advance, should I wait to put on the whipped cream and cookies?  I'd hate for them to get soggy!
Love your prep bowls. Would you share what make they are?
Hi Jemma, I was wondering could I substitute some cocoa powder for flour to make a chocolate base dough? Or would I need to add for fats to stop it from been dry? x
Hi Jemma, I was wondering what size giant cookie would this quantity of mixture make? Please x
Could I bake this in a pizza tray
I just made it! It’s fantastic thanksss Jemma your so helpful I wish one day I could go to crumbs and dollies it’s my dream to work there!
Delicious 😋
this is brilliant!
Hi Jemma, I have been trying to figure out what Caster Sugar would be the closest to here in the USA. When I ask “Siri” on Google, the answer is just plain sugar and not Confectioners sugar. Can you please tell me what I should be using in this recipe please? Thanks so much,  Cheers,   Irish ☘️ Jilli
Yum yum
I tried this recipe (only for the cookies) and it is AMAZING! Thank you so much! I got so many compliments (including my sister who doesn't like my baking 😁) You got a new sub
Please what is double cream 🤔
thanks Jemma you have been a great help
You're a really good cook
I love baking and mum isn't letting me bake because I hurt my foot and is really annoying
I really want to eat that dough hehe
I ve just finished making this. I wanted to know why my cookie pie came out quite greasy and cracked in the middle I did have to leave it  in the oven 5 minutes longer than what you had said otherwise it was too gooey in the middle. any help would be appreciated for my next attempt
instead of soft brown sugar can u use damerara sugar
I teared up looking at this beauty! I'm not kidding!
Love your videos normally, but I've realised I'm disappointed when the finished dessert is shown up front 😢 (it robs me of the anticipation 🤤)
This looks amazing! I watched this, and then the Brookie video, and it hit me; could we combine the two? The pie with brownie instead of the cream filling? yum!
Is it ok to use vanilla extract in liquid form
Hi all the way from India. i love you. proud of having to watch your videos and learn sooooo much. thank you so much.  kindly also post eggless baking or good substitutes for eggs as most of india is vegetarian jus like me. thanks once again
Vanilla bean paste
is there any alternatives to having cream
this has now become a family favourite... thanx again cupcake jemma
I made it and it was really good but for some reason the mini cookies came out flat and it just broke as you lift it.. I have no idea what am I doing wrong.. someone knows?
Can I freeze the cookie dough for a month?
omg this pie just stole my heart! (considering I just baked chocolate chunk cookies) I need to make this urgently! Thank you Jemma!
I'm on a diet right now, but if I see that thing served in my table...
What tin did she bake this in. Is it a loose bottom tin?
😱 this looks amazing- already made your cookies now for the big one
is bicarbonate of soda Baking Soda? Is double cream Heavy Cream? #Americanproblems
I  love 2 watch her bake & then try some. My question is, how do u no how many cups it takes, when she tells us the messurements n grams?
I found this channel through Zoe and I'm so happy I did this looks amazing xxxx
That is so yummy
What the fuck
I love the new version of s,more bronie
Could you use a cheesecake filling with this cookie base?!
Jemma you are so sweet person and skillfull pastry chef! you can call this recipe The 4C-Pie!
@cupcakeJemma do you have the full recipe on the website?
I'm extremely envious because your shirt looks awesome.
l like your nails
e Sr y uii uh huh  jj j uhhujgu
What happens if you use self reading flour ?
BEST THING EVER!!!!!!!.I watched this video like 7 months ago but i couldn't stop myself it looks so amazing
I have just made the recipe. I had some trouble at the very start, since I creamed butter and sugar using a wooden spoon...and my trusty arm.  They are absolutely delicious!! I made cookies with the whole mix and they turned out AMAZING.  Thank you so much, Jemma, I have found the recipe I was looking for.
I wonder how this would be as an ice cream pie! 😄
what kind of mixer is that you use? I might buy it!
Hello Jemma! I am making your cake! (if I manage not to eat the whole dough ;) I wanted to know if yuo use a fan or static setting for the oven!? thank you!! lots of love!
Cookie extravaganza! Brilliant!
If cooikeswirlc watched this,she'll be in absolute heaven cuz of COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKIEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪 COKIE CELEBRATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you next time on one of your videos show how to take out a cake or pie from a cake tin because I always have difficulties on that stage
I love your videos :) and your dimples are so cute
this could be even better recipe if u would make a cheesecake of that instead using cream.. i think? :D you know gelatin setted cheesecake.. not the baked one.. could it work? :D
Could it be a few hours in the fridge?
does anybody know how many cookies the mixture would make if i were use the mixture for the pie?
Is there a way to make this without using egg?
cookie pie, why?
This looks so so so GGOODD!!!
Hi Jemma, what a superb looking cake. One twist I added, I did a little chocolate layer between cake and filling, also I dipped the cookies one half in liquid chocolate before sticking them in the filling, so cake and cookies don´t get too soggy the next day. Worked well.
my kids just loooooove it!!!!  Jemma you are amazing!
can i just use brown sugar ? +cupcakejemma
love  your  show
This will probably,sound real stupid but does the quality of the vanilla extract affect the recipe if so what one would you recommend (I'm from Cardiff)
At 2:27 in the morning. All you can hear, no matter how awesome the video is, is innuendos. Is it just me? However, I did recreate this lovely cake and it was delicious!
Kahoymasci
you make it look so easy
you make it look so easy
i wish i was there to enjoy it with her, but i know i can make it myself
hi
it looks so yummy jemma
I really love this recipe it looks nice and tastes nice 😋😋😋😊😊😊
well...I was not looking for this kinda creampie, but since I am here I might as well watch it.
Hi, Jemma. Can I know why my little cookies don not turn out like yours??
Hi Jemma! just wanted to let you know that I baked this cake yesterday for my brothers birthday and everyone loved it! Thank you for a yummy recipe! Avital from Israel
@cupcakejemma Hey Jemma! I'm actually in a food crisis right now. We have no brown sugar and I can't go to the store even though I want to make this so bad! Is there ANY way to substitute brown sugar with white sugar, and will I need to add any other ingredients?
I thought it said ICE CREAM pie and now I have an idea hehe :)
yuuuuuuuum
You are so creative I have allways loved to bake but I really love craftsyou are so talented!!!!!
I want pie
Such an amazing recipe!!!  My family always asks me to make it! Thanks for sharing!
Just baked this and it's totally amazing!!!!! Thanks jemma!!!!! :-)
this video made me tear up thinking about all. those. cookies.
I am addicted to your videos! Thank you so much for this great channel!!! I was always looking for a very good baking channel with nice videos and amazing but also easy recipes which you actually can make at home too and I finally found it! Thank you for the amazing work!!!
Can u please make a strawberry milkshake pie recipe
Do you  do any lowcarb  sweets?
Omg! Birthday cake decision has been made!
Incredible recipe ! I did it for like 4 times and my brothers and sisters keep asking me to cook it again !  Thank you!
This pie failed miserably when i tried it
gotta love some creampie
I made this today and added sliced bananas underneath the cream. It was absolutely delightful!!! Nomnom never eating anything else ever again...
if i dont like cream is there any more fillings i could use?
A yummy looking treat/dessert.
FOR EVERYONE IN AMERICA, HERE ARE THE INGREDIENTS:  1 1/3 cup + 2 tbsp flour 1 tsp baking soda (which is bicarbonate of soda here in US) 1/2 tsp salt 1 egg (farm fresh or free range are best!) 2 tsp vanilla extract 2 sticks unsalted butter 1/3 cup + 2 tbsp regular sugar (which is caster sugar in US) 3/4 cup + 2 tbsp soft light brown sugar 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp milk chocolate chips 1 2/3 cup heavy cream (which is double cream in US) 2 tbsp regular sugar Bake both at 335 for suggested times! Any other recipes i should convert?
I can use dark brown sugar insted of the light one?  P.S Great video i realy liked it😃
+CupcakeJemma I love your videos
good
Can I use baking soda instead of bicarbonate soda??
What brand of butter do you use? I bake quite often and I tend to use lurpak but it can be quite hard sometimes when I take it out the fridge!
Can you use anything else than whipped cream? I don't like the taste but I would really like to do this pie. Maybe buttercream?
For some reason when i think of jemma i think of jamie.. You know that guy from woolies. Jamie Oliver i think? I dunno are they dating? They seriously remind me of eachother!
Jemma's only got one earring on :3
Made this the other week. The first "cake" ive ever made and it was absolutely ludicrously amazing! Love it :D
This looks amazing! I just found your channel, and I love it! I love to bake! I'll definitely be trying this recipe : )
Love your recipes Jemma. I'm in high school & took catering as an option. Your page has given me loads of ideas on some good recipes I could make in my practical lessons. Thanks & I look forward to future recipes :) Reply back if you get the chance
Good god i love your Videos! Big fan from Germany :) !
Do you have the measurements of these in cups? :)
oooooooh!!! what this in her hand !!!!!
Amazing! She whisked that cream by hand and not by a hand mixer!
IM DEFINITELY GOING TO TRY THIS!!! 😍😍🔫🔫
Can't wait to visit the shop when I come to London in couple of weeks!!
CupcakeJemma  you could also use vanilla icecream as an aleternative for the wip cream👍
Jemma, you're really really great!!!
This looks amazing, and I love your kitchen setup. Thanks so much for uploading this video :)
Great idea!!!!
amazing!!
Need to make this xxx
How about that Cookie-base but with a Cheescake filling?? Yes that sounds yummy... I know
Christ almighty, i wish i had a big sister like you O_O Then again, that perhaps wouldn't be conducive to my long term health xD
Holaantes aparecia la receta una a una en una esquinita :) Ahora ya no :(
Hey my cupcake guru, began my own cupcake journey learning from an online course tot by u... thank u so much for that... btw Is double cream the same as "cooking cream"?... love ur style !! Keep it up!
Do you have to use the bicarbonate soda?
Creampie... 😊
Gosh, I just promised myself not to eat too much sweets. Guess I'm gonna have to reconsider that :D
You are so pretty ♡♡♡

Creampie......

This looks delicious! All of your baked goods always has great presentation too, you are so skilled at decorating. :)
CupcakeJemma It was SO nice to meet you in the Soho shop today and it really made my day! This cookie cream pie looks heavenly (while I'm eating the cupcakes I bought today lol). Keep the good videos coming!
Would love a recipe for the ultimate rich and moist chocolate cake!
Sometimes when I bake chocolate chip cookies, the dough doesn't spread out. What causes that?
..so freakin' hungry now -.-
Just amaizing again! 😄My family loved it so much that it disappeared in 24 hours! And it was also quick to make! Now I'm heading to try the white chocklate chip cookie! Thanks again 'Cookie'Jemma!
So sometimes when I make my chocolate chip cookies the chips don't melt in the oven. When I bite the cookie it's not ooey gooey goodness, but a sad old chip that didn't melt:( Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?!
Now that looks good !!😀
Oh dear there goes my diet!! But well worth it, i will be making this soon!!!
Checkout my channel
Heaven👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
the base for the tart looks like a giant cookie👅👅
+CupcakeJemma can I use salted butter instead of unsalted and not add the salt in it?
Love this !! I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOME MORE PIE VIDEOS
those cookies look perfect!!! I want to make only the little one to ('cause I can't eat that whole pie by myself 😁) but I don't know what to do with the egg, (1/4egg ,I just wanna make fifteen cookies)  pleeeeease help🙏🏼🙏🏼
Please please please make m&m cookies!
I wish schools in America would teach the metric system:(
Plz make angel food cake or did u already
Could you do Borbone cupcakes?
Hey, can you do a minion cake next, I would love it :)
Just served this up to my three grandchildren and they gave it the thumbs up - was nice and easy to make too! I didn't have enough choc chips so added M&Ms! - have to go, they're asking for seconds!
Yum! this looks so good <3
OMG that cookie cake is to die for!!!! 👍😍🌸🍪🍰
A true master piece ;P, can´t wait to try it out
creampie huh?
If I were to make mini version of this in a cupcakes/muffin tin, which baking duration should i follow? ^^
I just made the cookies using this recipe! Divine! Thanks for the recipe
Will the cream make the cookie go soggy and how long will it keep for??? please answer
should I use my dough hooks for this CupcakeJemma
Wonderful! I'll kill just to eat a small portion of this cake!
It looks haevenly, but how many calories has it? :D It must be very high number.
This looks so delicious!
You live in London and there it is called double cream? I live in the United States. Here I think they call it heavy whipping cream. Is it the same thing? Please reply 😉
Your mouth doesnt move the same time as you speak
Hi, Jemma where's your lipstick from? It looks amazing x
And that ladies and gents it's what people call....CREATION....!!!!
I don't know why but I always love the moment when she says 'pop' or 'whack'  always wait for the moment :)
IF I WANNA USE WHIPP CREAM POWDER HOW MUCH CAN I USE
can i use less sugar in every recipe you posted? because i found that half of the amount you use is quite enough sweet for me
😱😱😱😱😱
Maybe a simple strawberries short cake? Might helps us ( those that hardly bake ) bake a nice cake ✌🏻️
Jemma I was trying to make whipped cream but it didn't get stiff it is still loose like normal cream....the steps were lyk this I kept my cream for chilling in the fridge and I made some gelatin liquid bcz I needed it as an icing....then I took the cream out and started whipping it with a hand beater for about 5 minutes then I added some gelatin and granulated sugar......then I whipped it for 5 more minutes but ntng happened
come and watch my new cooking video! onion ham muffin!  come and watch it!
CupcakeJemma Hi Jemma - great video! I am just making this awesome pie as we speak and I have a quick question. What is the desired consistency of the little cookies after the 7-8 mins in the oven? Mine seem soft all they way, not really baked. Will they harden as they cool? The pie is perfectly cooked after the 18 mins, but the cookies I felt might need more time. Could it also be oven-related, and is the 170 degrees in a fan oven? Would love some input on this.
Love
CupcakeJemma Chocolate Chip Cookies will rule this world!!! Such an amazing Pie. Very, very indulgent :) Great recipe as always!
I would love to know/see how you make caramel popcorn!
I need to know what pan she uses for the big cookie! Planning to make it.
u must be a genius why hasnt anyone else thought of this earlier xD
If only that filling was a cream chease that would've been perfect to me
I will attempt to not make a cream pie joke and just act like its a yummy dessert
Love your Videos Jem!
Cookie Monster's dream! :)
Wow
That would be great with cheesecake base too!
Are these the chewy kind of cookies? The other recipe for soft cookies used two eggs. So I'm assuming less one egg = chewier texture? CupcakeJemma
That is great and now my mind is shouting at me Chocolate Chip Cookie custard tart
Well, I know what I'm doing for my birthday...
Amazing that the pie crust is really soft ❤️
I really enjoy your videos Jemma :D wish I could bake as well as you
It will be great with red velvet cookies and cream cheese
YEESSS. This looks so good!
Mmm, no doubt this is decadent as anything, but imagine: instead of the luscious, voluptuous whipped cream, a satiny, glossy pool of dark ganache. *DIES*
I wish I knew what kind of vanilla she uses. It's not a liquid but not thick enough to be a gel or a paste. It just looks so lush. I have no idea why, but every time I see it in one of these videos I think "what is this magic vanilla?!" I'm a weird baking kid. 💁🏻
It's always surprising to me that there are actually dislikes for this =((
Wow, you've done it again Jemma! Another amazing dessert! What can't you do? 🍰🍪
Delicious!
ohhhhh my goodness YUMMMMMM!!!!!! That cookie dough looks JUST the right texture!! I can almost smell it!
Omg!! Yummy! Thanks Jemma 😀😀👍🏻🍪🍪
You are a mad genius of sweets!!!!
That looks so good and the cookies look soft and chewy! Yum!!
Exc idea as always! Looks so delicious!
Yumm!
How many inches or centimeters was your baking dish?
Wauw! This looks so good! I must make this as soon as I'm back in the Netherlands...  And thank you Jemma for these fantastic, delicious recipes! I can't wait to try it all!
Hey Jemma , was just wondering how many of the normal siZe cookies this would make
YUUUUUUUM!!!! I'm gonna make this! 😁
Can you also use cups, tablespoon, teaspoons, etc. for those in the U.S
Who else died watching this?
#CookieComa
I would replace the whip cream with ice cream! Either way one though would be yummy.
I walked past your shop yesterday and saw you inside, but was too shy to come in and say hi! Love your videos and your recipes :)
Ok you have totally melted my heart with this!! Can we all say YUMMMMMYYYY!!! Love you videos, wish you uploaded more than once a wk!! :))

what could I use instead of whipped cream
Hey Jemma, whenever I make biscuits or cookies I cook them for the amount of time it says in the recipe I use but am always worried that they are underdone as they come out squidy in the middle.. is that normal?
Omg, love u!! Greetings from Czech Republic!
Welp. I have a new favorite pie now.
🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪
waw magnifique
Could you please make vanilla ice cream
Mmmmmmmmmmm some yummy stuff going into my belly in 5 mins
This looks so good! I just really don't like whipped cream. I don't even know what it is, the consistency, maybe? Do you think I could do a creamy yogurt type thing instead? :D
Hi mam jemma, is bicarbonate Soda and baking soda are the same?
I did something like this last year for my baking final in college. I put the cookie dough into two little ramekins and filled it with cheesecake and baked it. i even made mini cookies and chocolate whipped cream. We needed 3 elements and that's why there was whipped cream. My professors loved it and one even asked for the recipe.
literally my dream to work alongside you
Wow! I've been waiting for the whole week to dig my eyes on your new video. Lov'd it :)
