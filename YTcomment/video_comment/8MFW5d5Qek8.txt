I have made many times the one with dates since I saw your recipe. Thanks, it's awesome :)))
Mi servirebbero le dosi mi potete aiutare ? 😅
That looks tasty, whats the shelf life of this as you added water to it?
תודה

I just tried it and I literally can't get over how delicious this is
Good. I have also subscribe
Que delicioso 😜
👍👍👍
You should try my nut butter 😉
Whats the measurements for all the ingredients
I've just made the dates version, buy there is a problem: it's too little, it will not last a week 😅😅 wonderful recipe, thanks!!! Next time I Will double or even triple the amount 😉
I made the first version yesterday with my nutribullet. Love it!! 3 ingredients but so yummy, just like regular Nutella (little different texture)
Oh my word! This looks so delicious. I appreciate you taking the time to share this. I will try this. I love experimenting. I thought I would try it on cinnamon rolls
Chocolate sauce production line factory direct supply https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SndsNOnl2cc
Thank you! Will try these very soon!!
Omg You have a NUTELLA Recipe!!! This Video should be a Sin... I can't watch... ..(**Peek and Press Play**)
After roasting the nuts,  place in a kitchen towel/tea towel, and rub them around to remove the skins/husks. This removes the grainy texture in your video. Great presentation!
Roast the nuts pour boiled golden  brown caramel over nuts . spread on a greased tray. When cold mill into paste and add equal parts melted couverture. It's called gianduja . It's what nutella pretends to be.
thinking about making this again just so I could try adding some to my banana ice cream. Bet it would taste way more heavenly compared to only adding some chocolate powder in the milkXbanana mix! :)
Only 5 days??!
02:05 On which planet and in which universe you add WATER to nutella? Water and oils just don't mix. The original recipe calls for MILK, about 100 ml of it.  Congrats on screwing what is arguably one of the best dishes on the planet.
Hey is this recipe perishable? I've made it before and it was amazing but now I want to make it again and deliver a jar overseas to my boyfriend, just checking if it can survive in transit for a week lol
Great video, thanks for showing multiple ways to sweeten!
I used Erythritol powder as sweetener and walnut oil instead of water. I liked it so much.
That’s hazelnut butter not Nutella because I can see you did not put cocoa powder
Remove the skins from the Hazelnuts!
Why would it spoil after a few days if refrigerated?
Y'know ... You're pretty good lookin' for a chick with no black eyes.
You don't ad salt?
Tried the first recipe turn out amazing it is best to keep it in fridge before trying it , will try the second today 💪
u must be kristen bell's lost cousin!
I made it!! I made it! There's just nothing to say, it's just that I made itt! ❤️
I'll try mixing some of this with banana based ice cream, pretty sure it will taste heavenly!
Try using milk instead of water it's much better!
Schhhhhhuuugar
No Palm oil !!😃😃😃
New Sub 😍
Finally, I found a nice homemade nutella recipe! Thank you so much for this! Is a great recipe made gift
Cool.. my dogs pretty good at making something that looks like that.
Please use a de-esser...please
Thanks for these three simple and healthy recipes!
Starts @ 00:54
Can I use honey
Looks yummy! I will try to make it,- but without any sweetener at all,- it will be healthier that way :)
I love it I'm going to try it today!!😄
could I use dates paste instead? and if so which quantity? Thank you very much for your video :))
I tried and it turned out amazing! Thank you! LOVE IT 🧡
thanks a lot for sharing this new nutella version so easy and healthy keep going with your great job☺
thanks for sharing this recipe I was looking for something like this
How many hazelnuts, cocoa powder and dates have you used?
I tried the date Nutella one and i was really surprise how much i liked it! I didn't eat Nutella for a looong time and I'm not really into hazelnuts but this is incredible. Next time i will increase the cocoa powder cuz why not and decrease the amount of dates it's just too sweet for me.
What if you dont have a food processor?
I love Nutella with pancakes!
its not netella if it don't have chocolate in it
I TRIED THIS WITH DATES ... NOW I'M ADDICTED T-T THANK YOU
Can i use honey instead of maple syrup? Thanks😊
Hummmmmmmmmmmmmm <3
Don't add water with maple syrup one it'll last much longer
I tried about 5 times and it always turn-out amazing! I love it!
Can you make a healthy version of peanut butter cups?
Or just sat the whole jar as pudding
If you don't have hazelnuts you can use hazelnut flour
Yay! I found a healthier nutella recipe! And so much easier with less ingredients! Thanks!
You used to eat it right out of the jar? That's sick.
I made this using the dates version of the recipe--- YUM!!!  Will make again!
I made the maple syrup one and OH MY GOD THANK YOU it's seriously amazing <3
We can't use the hazelnuts raw ?  If we can, do we need to soak them in something to neutralize the inhibitor enzymes ?
Really delicious and full of healthy nutrients! Better than everything on the market. Thank you for the recipe.
So I messed it up. I think my food processor is just bad. It wouldn't make butter, just flour. I added some water and it made a thick paste.  I sort of fixed things by adding cashew milk with the maple syrup and chocolate  powder. It's a milk chocolate taste with some grainy taste from the nuts. Did I give up too soon on making the nut butter?
What food processor are you using?i can see it can make nut buter can you tell me witch one is it and how powerfull it is because i dont want to buy expencive ones.Thank you :)
I just made it. It's great thank you for sharing
tried it, complete disaster. no beautiful spread, just a thick gloopy paste, and I followed the recipe exactly. off to find a better recipe :(
Personally, I would not call this Nutella . This is more like hazelnut butter done 3 different ways. Also ,,your spread would taste so much better if you peel the skin off of your roasted hazelnuts. All in all ,your recipe is nice ,and it seems like a lot of people love it.
Just posted a video of me attempting to make Nutella 😂 check it out if you wanna!
I love to make nuttela grilled sandwich or sometimes nutella ice cream 😍😍
How long does this stay fresh and does it need to be refrigerated?
I eat Nutella as is haha
wow amazing
Great job Olga on presenting your video content light and rich! I big Like
Nutella on pancakes 😻
I did this today and it tastes so much better than real nutella!
you can achieve a even more fine out come if you rub most of skin off of the hazelnuts after roasting them. You will also have a less bitter taste.  Using water based products to make it smoother, will shorten it's storage life.
Olga, Thank you so much for this delishious recipe. I though that original nutella is way tastier, but.. Now i can't live without your nutella recipe :)
Just tried it and it tastes amazing. My gf didn't like it though as she found it too nutty compared to the original. Also why not add almond milk instead of water? Surely it will taste more like milk chocolate?
Just did the recipe and it taste PARADISE <3 Thank you so much :)
can you make it without hazelnut
Love it!! Thanks of this tutorial <3
I like to eat I out of the gar
good stuff
Could you use brown sugar for the sweetener ?
wow
Starts at 0:52  In case if your wondering..
I LOVEEEEE your recipes . Ur my favourite healthy cooking chef
This is awesome
if I watch one of your videos I would say ( you're a genius)
Can you use plant based milk instead of water? I'm thinking of trying that 🤓
180 degrees celsius, for normal people
Hello dear, I love your channel! On the other hand, do you know how I can substitute the hazelnuts? Thank you.
Great recipe! I tried the version with the Dates and it just Turned oft perfectly! Love it! Taste is also really good
I just made r recipe using Mapple syrup.  so delicious.. I'm glad I chose r instead of others.  yours is more healthy and simple.    my picky eater girl loves the Nutella I made, I'm so happy. thanks for posting.
Will honey taste good as a sweetener in this recipe?
Hi Olga :) I used pre-made homemade hazelnut butter. I thought it'd mix well within a few pulse, but oh God was I wrong! I processed for up to ten minutes, and the more I blended, the weirder it became I used maple syrup and ended up with a weird gooey substance that doesn't taste good at all. Do you have a comment on this Olga? Thank you :)
Hi Olga :) Why only 5 days? Hazelnut butter keeps in the fridge for over a year. Thank you :)
I tried this today but I definitely need make some improvements next time :D Awesome recipe thanks for spreading the vegan message <3
Cam I use blender?
I'm Sorry, i'm Really Sorry, i know it is Not the place ..But i have to say, this Smile of Yours is very Intoxicating and is more appealling that the Recipe which looks Ab/Fably Yummy..!...You are One Pretty Woman.....!!!! Subs ...!
I love love love your recipes!
That is a very interesting recipe! I'm glad it doesn't contain avocado. Has anyone tried making it with other nuts (walnuts, cashews)?
i use honey as sweetner ,2 tbsp of sunflower oil to smooth it
I think that the best way to use Nutella is on pancakes.
You should put in the title this is vegan friendly
Can I use a blender ??
I ran into your vids. And you got me at DIY Nutella.  The one at the store has too much sugar.  You have a new Sub.
Hi, new to your channel. Great content - can see the effort put into each video. One tip/suggestions/request is to add the Celsius alongside the Fahrenheit for the oven stuff. Please & thank you.
thank you for making my life wonderful
What a relaxing voice ☺️
Seems so good ! I have to try it ! Thanks  Did you ever try a mix of the 3 ? Thanks!  I like it on crêpes in the morning (1 spoon of chickpea flour, 2 spoons of buckwheat flour and some water)
Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!!
The easiet vegan nutella recipe i ever seen ! And i tried it yesterday ! Taste absolutely great .Used it for toast as breakfast today ! Tomorrow will used them tk baked some cookies .😍
Sacriledge that is not Nutella.
Your homemade Nutella is freaking awesome!!!!
Where can I get hazelnuts?
I want to try this! Great video Olga!💕
You lied,u said it would last 5 days,but it was over just in few hours,it was so gud!(but u lied)
This is a cute easy recipe but what is the calorie count and nutritional breakdown?
you are so good...someday you will get a lot of vewers and subscribers...ceep making videoss..youre amazing!!!!
Is it just me or does she kinda look like Mellisa from pretty little liars 😂
Can I use honey instead of maple syrup? thanks!
could you use a blender
What food processor do you use?
Hi what happens does it go bad after 5 days?
I am new to your channel and I absolutely love your videos!!!!!
did you said add water or wodka?  i added vodka it is smaller voda.
How many calories contain a homemade Nutella jar ? Thank's Ps: Sorry for my english i'm french
hi can I ask is hazelnut  flavoring just flavoring?or does  it  have  actual  hazel  nut in it ?  my sun is allergic to all nuts and I'm trying  to  find  an alternative  to  foods that he cannot  have..
Just made the maple syrup version, soooo good. 💛🙏🏻🐰🌿🤘🏻🌎
strawberries and pretzels
Do I keep the shells on the hazelnuts or take them out?
You literally use dates in everything😂
prefer the normal nutell a!
Could you freeze it to make it last longer?
!! Do you think I could make this and freeze it in ice cube trays to portion it then just heat it up before using?  Thank you <3!!
i eat it with spoon..... or sometimes i put fruits inside do i will choose the first one
+Fablunch Thank you for sharing your recipes! I will definitely try them! Also, would roasting them in a pan be the same? And instead of water, do you think melted coconut oil is a good substitute?
Okay i know you probably won't see this comment but i just wanted to thank you so much for your videos.. You are honestly inspiring and i watch your videos on repeat! I have become vegetarian recently and i am trying to transition into a vegan but i find it very difficult to do in my country since its a small island and there aren't many vegan options out there:/ but i am so glad someone can help me enjoy the things i love guilt free :D thank you fablunch xx
Is coconut sugar same as brown sugar?
it looks amazing, but what about the quantities ??
it looks amazing, but what about the quantities ??
So happy I found your channel! It is exactly what I've been looking for  quick and to the point easy recipes.  Omg! so excited to try this recipe.
+Fablunch Only 5 days?! :'( ... Well, but still it looks delicious! Kisses from Venezuela!
is it important to add maple syrup and is there anything instead of maple syrup ????
Should I use normal syrup, or organic maple syrup?
Looks sooo good and easy! Do you think this can be done with a normal blender too?
lol... why would anyone dislike... this was totally AWESOME!!! Thank you for sharing:)
Thank you so much, it looks yammy i'll try to make it.
This is sooo easy! Yum! I love nutella on crepes or pancakes and on strawberries.
Thank you for sharing :)
Can you make it in a blender?
YUM! Amazing! :)
You can toast the nuts in a frying pan, also...
I totally love Nutella but since I am vegan I'll give this a shot and try it. But for the first one can use agave syrup instead of maple syrup and also carob instead of cacao?
You r so brilliant!!!
Wow! All the nutella recipes look amazing!
I absolutley adore your account and this recipe, thank you!
Will definitely have to try this. The only change I would do is to remove the roasted hazelnut skins to avoid their bitter flavor. Thank you Olga
Думаю мой блендер не переживет этого :D Боюсь сломается..:(
It won't last for 5 days - unless you make 10lbs of it...or 20 or 30...
I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE! I never imagined it could be so easy to make nutella
I'm happy that it's healthy and all that,but making it is more expensive for me since hazelnuts are expensive where I live :(
I love this recipe and I love your channel!!! 💖 I only wish you would make the quantities that you used a little clearer! Thank you 😘😘
Your recipes always unique and creative
Hazelnut and chocolate is my all time favorite combination! Roasted hazelnuts definitely help boost the flavor and I love using coconut sugar. I can't wait to try it with maple syrup and dates next time!
With dates 😄😄😄😄
This looks so good !!
this looks amazing! No more store bought nutella!
Fab! thanks for sharing :)
Hi Olga, could i use honey instead of maple syrup,would it taste any different?
is this vegan?...If it is...Im so luck!..I missed my nutella so much ..but this looks like I can eat , without the guilt....Thanks so much for the video
hey this sounds stupid but could you make chocolate spread the same ways but without hazelnuts?
Could you please make a video about how to prepare tofu and that actually taste good? :)
You look beautiful! I love the recipe!!
Love how simple this recipe is! I am definitely going to need to make this! & use it as a frosting?? YUM! :) vegan staple for sure!
Неужели фундук таким жидким становится?? А миндаль можно использовать вместо него?
Thanks for this
The sound is pretty bad! Try putting the mic close to you!
I love spreading Nutella on homemade crepes with sliced bananas and strawberries! I can't wait to try and make this. Thanks for sharing! :)
Who knew nutella could be made so easily. Awesome recipe.
Looks incredible Olga! I love your summery dress too!
Fablunch could you also buy roasted hazelnuts or is it better to roast them on your own.
Olga! I have the exact same dress :D
This looks so awesome!
Can u make banana bread u made in your fab lunch containers? Or cheesecake?
I love this!
It seems more like chocolate hazelnut butter, not really nutella. I think adding an avocado or something to reduce the nutty flavor would help.
YUUUUM <3 Another great recipe Olga :)
great video, great recipe, definatly gonna try this one out
Hi Olga :) thank you very much for all your videos! Its a great help for starters of healty eating like me.
Have to try this, thank you for the recipe
This is amazing!!!
Sounds so yummy! <3
Aloha! I was wondering if I can use a nutribullet on this type of foods? I really need a vitamix and a good processor. What do you recommend to save money to get one of them? Plz let me know! It would be greatly appreciated
Olga do you think is possible to use honey as the sweetener of this recipe?:)
Does anyone say nut-tella rather than new-tella?!
Wow!!! Yummy
SO excited!
OMG, I need to try this!! Love nutella, I eat it with spoon right out of the jar :-D
Yummers!
Hi thanks for another great video. Could you make peshwari naan bread. I have just discovered it...its so delicious.
OMG 😍😍😍😍 making the first one tomorrow!!
Awww thank you for this!! I'll definitely make it, I love nutella!!
Love your videos so much! Also I love you. :)
